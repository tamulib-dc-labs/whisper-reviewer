WEBVTT

00:03.592 --> 00:04.954
I'm putting this on, OK?

00:06.075 --> 00:09.299
We're with Mr. Dave Kirshenbaum in New York at the Carnegie Bookshop.

00:09.319 --> 00:10.660
I just want to identify the tape.

00:10.680 --> 00:15.706
And you just told me you have a catalog of George D. Smith when he was selling things for $2.

00:15.846 --> 00:31.624
How you doing?

00:31.644 --> 00:32.265
David Redden?

00:32.414 --> 00:33.936
Yeah, I'm going to give it to David.

00:34.777 --> 00:35.257
Well, you know what?

00:35.297 --> 00:37.520
You could loan it to me, and I'll give it back to you.

00:39.121 --> 00:39.722
Sadler.

00:40.283 --> 00:42.185
I have that Sadler set over there.

00:42.205 --> 00:43.286
I've got to shut this off later.

00:44.707 --> 00:48.492
Well, anyway, you said that you may well be the only person alive.

00:48.612 --> 00:49.653
Well, I don't know of anybody.

00:49.673 --> 00:50.414
But it's possible.

00:50.794 --> 00:51.835
I don't know of anybody.

00:51.995 --> 00:52.796
I don't remember.

00:53.577 --> 00:54.838
I don't remember anybody.

00:54.919 --> 00:56.360
Did you attend as a bookman?

00:56.841 --> 00:57.081
Yes.

00:58.142 --> 01:00.885
And so were you there bidding and...

01:01.169 --> 01:02.831
Hoping to bid or buy?

01:03.092 --> 01:04.474
That's right.

01:04.494 --> 01:05.335
How old were you then?

01:06.236 --> 01:08.419
Well, I was born in 95.

01:08.660 --> 01:13.046
I'll be 95 January 5.

01:14.929 --> 01:16.331
God bless you.

01:18.414 --> 01:18.774
I had your energy.

01:18.794 --> 01:19.636
What's your secret?

01:20.577 --> 01:21.739
Is there a secret to this?

01:22.139 --> 01:24.302
No secret.

01:24.322 --> 01:25.544
I've been in this business.

01:25.624 --> 01:28.408
I opened in 1910.

01:28.508 --> 01:29.129
Here in New York?

01:29.169 --> 01:29.590
In New York.

01:30.380 --> 01:42.611
I've been in New York ever since, and I've attended every important sale, any sale as a matter of fact, important and non-important.

01:42.631 --> 01:48.196
Would you say that you do most of your acquiring at options, or do you also do private advertising?

01:48.216 --> 01:48.397
No, no.

01:48.417 --> 01:50.118
Years ago, I used to buy big libraries.

01:50.138 --> 01:52.641
You see, I had a very big place, I have to tell you.

01:53.301 --> 01:59.627
I now dwindle down to doing specifics only.

02:00.907 --> 02:02.288
I had a very big place.

02:02.369 --> 02:06.533
I had a place twenty times, forty times the size.

02:07.854 --> 02:11.158
Must have had two, three hundred thousand books.

02:11.658 --> 02:12.899
Wow.

02:12.919 --> 02:15.742
And I was there for 59th Street.

02:15.862 --> 02:17.444
I was there for fifty years.

02:17.764 --> 02:19.686
Was it also called the Carnegie Bookshop?

02:19.706 --> 02:19.867
Yeah.

02:20.928 --> 02:24.972
Has it always been called the Carnegie Bookshop, your business?

02:24.992 --> 02:25.092
Yes.

02:26.827 --> 02:29.451
And you said you used to buy entire libraries.

02:29.491 --> 02:31.193
I used to buy entire libraries, yes.

02:31.594 --> 02:33.456
And I'd buy at auction.

02:34.177 --> 02:35.599
I'd buy for customers.

02:36.701 --> 02:41.047
You, as I understand it, were extremely friendly with Bradley Martin.

02:41.167 --> 02:41.888
Very friendly.

02:42.008 --> 02:45.153
For fifty years, I used to see him.

02:45.393 --> 02:48.557
I had lunch with him two or three times a week.

02:48.637 --> 02:52.503
Were you largely responsible for building his library?

02:52.603 --> 02:54.105
A great many of the things.

02:54.205 --> 02:55.467
He bought all over the world.

02:56.493 --> 03:01.659
Would you judge him as one of the great book collectors of your lifetime?

03:01.679 --> 03:02.100
No question about it.

03:03.882 --> 03:10.510
In terms of not only the quality of the collection, but also what other qualities would you say?

03:10.530 --> 03:20.002
Well, first of all, he was particular about condition.

03:20.022 --> 03:25.068
And if he didn't want a thing, no matter what it was, he wouldn't buy it.

03:25.088 --> 03:25.909
And if he'd want it,

03:27.307 --> 03:30.152
And he'd show him something, he'd sit right here where you're sitting.

03:30.653 --> 03:31.915
And I would show him something.

03:32.516 --> 03:38.406
No matter what I'd say, he'd take out his wallet, write a check right, sit down.

03:38.426 --> 03:48.083
Was he the kind of collector who, and as we talk about Bradley Martin, I'm looking at his catalogs, the catalogs of his books over there, yeah, because I know the books.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.407
He is one collector who really knew his books.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.470
Oh, yes.

03:52.585 --> 03:55.810
I'm sure there are collectors who don't even know half of the things that they have.

03:55.910 --> 03:57.832
That's an accumulator.

03:58.153 --> 03:59.495
That's not a collector.

03:59.515 --> 04:01.638
Maybe you can define the difference for me.

04:02.359 --> 04:05.303
Could you characterize one from the other?

04:05.383 --> 04:07.466
There are some people that are accumulators.

04:07.867 --> 04:10.170
They'll take anything.

04:10.190 --> 04:15.938
But there are some people that are very careful with what they eat.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.762
You've got to give them certain things.

04:19.670 --> 04:23.134
Were you disappointed that the Martin Collection was sold?

04:23.154 --> 04:25.556
Do you think it should have been kept together as a unit?

04:26.357 --> 04:29.460
Well, that's been going on for many years.

04:30.521 --> 04:39.671
I had taught Bradley and Mrs. Martin and Gordon Ray, who he was very fond of.

04:39.871 --> 04:45.857
Gordon Ray was the head of the Guggenheim Foundation.

04:45.877 --> 04:48.360
And we tried.

04:48.796 --> 04:53.582
to give the collection, his bird book collection.

04:53.602 --> 04:57.026
That's probably a copy.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.349
You were saying that Bradley Martin's interest was birds.

04:59.389 --> 05:01.031
I think that was the last thing that you said.

05:01.592 --> 05:07.680
Well, his bird books were extraordinary.

05:09.802 --> 05:14.588
It was really a great, great collection.

05:14.608 --> 05:17.672
It was even suggested that there was perhaps the greatest

05:18.175 --> 05:20.478
ornithological collection anywhere.

05:20.498 --> 05:20.999
No, that's right.

05:21.339 --> 05:24.223
And that might have been an argument for keeping it as a unit.

05:24.503 --> 05:24.984
That's right.

05:25.564 --> 05:27.166
How did you personally feel about that?

05:27.206 --> 05:28.848
Did it bother you to see it broken up?

05:28.948 --> 05:35.016
Well, yes, in a way, because it'll never be put together again.

05:37.579 --> 05:44.588
And yet there's the argument on the other side that was used for Robert Ho, it was suggested for Bradley Martin,

05:45.023 --> 05:50.148
That where would the collectors of tomorrow be if people didn't allow their books to go back into the marketplace?

05:50.468 --> 05:51.169
That's true.

05:52.070 --> 05:52.690
That's true.

05:54.072 --> 05:55.553
How do you feel about that?

05:55.573 --> 06:00.378
Well, I feel that he wanted to give it away, but— That's—you think he did.

06:00.398 --> 06:03.220
He wanted—he wanted to give it away as a unit, or he wanted to— As a unit.

06:03.400 --> 06:03.721
He did?

06:04.001 --> 06:04.261
Yes.

06:07.164 --> 06:10.267
Why didn't he—he was so careful about everything else in his lifetime.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.208
Well, he was very careful.

06:11.608 --> 06:13.410
He wanted to give it to the Smithsonian.

06:15.382 --> 06:23.455
and it didn't work out.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.281
You mean he just never got around to it?

06:27.421 --> 06:29.945
No, he did go around to it.

06:29.965 --> 06:32.389
The association, they didn't handle it properly.

06:32.409 --> 06:32.770
Really?

06:34.653 --> 06:36.095
That's too bad.

06:36.275 --> 06:38.799
We went to Indiana, we thought they wanted it.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.462
Lilly, the Lilly Library?

06:40.622 --> 06:42.385
Yeah, that's quite an extraordinary library.

06:43.867 --> 06:50.314
I was there with Mrs. Martin, and it just didn't materialize.

06:51.035 --> 06:57.362
Then he got sick, you know, and he was sick for quite a time.

06:57.382 --> 07:07.793
And up to, up to, very recent, I mean, I used to see him, as I said, two or three times a week.

07:07.973 --> 07:09.655
We'd sit and talk.

07:10.141 --> 07:15.927
all the catalogs that came in, and he'd mark off, you know, show me what he ordered.

07:15.947 --> 07:18.930
We'd discuss things.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.932
Of course, he was a gentleman.

07:20.972 --> 07:22.954
He was a patrician in the truest sense.

07:23.215 --> 07:23.675
Oh, yes.

07:24.136 --> 07:30.102
But I also understand that he was very conscious of what he was paying for things, too.

07:30.182 --> 07:32.845
I mean, he did not want to overpay.

07:32.865 --> 07:33.465
Is that correct?

07:33.485 --> 07:36.248
Well, I wouldn't make that statement, no.

07:36.829 --> 07:39.051
If he wanted a thing, he'd buy it.

07:39.976 --> 07:42.079
and worry about how much it cost later.

07:44.221 --> 07:46.044
Let's go back to the beginning with yourself.

07:46.604 --> 07:54.774
Now, if you were at the wholesale in 1911 and 1912, you were just 16, 17, 18 years old.

07:56.236 --> 07:56.717
Yes, sir.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.640
When I was 13, I went to Libby's in Boston.

07:59.661 --> 08:02.184
There was an auction there.

08:03.926 --> 08:05.267
Wow.

08:05.328 --> 08:07.871
Let's start from the beginning, because I don't know very much about you.

08:07.891 --> 08:08.912
Now, are you born in New York?

08:09.373 --> 08:09.713
Yes.

08:10.655 --> 08:13.619
And how did you become fascinated with books?

08:13.980 --> 08:18.185
How did you become... Well, that's a question that I came in.

08:18.205 --> 08:20.569
You know, things happen.

08:20.589 --> 08:22.471
You have to sell books for the Salvation Army.

08:22.972 --> 08:23.873
And how old were you then?

08:24.314 --> 08:25.696
Well, I was about 12 or 13.

08:25.956 --> 08:26.357
Uh-huh.

08:26.977 --> 08:31.444
And those years when you were 12 or 13, you were a man.

08:32.625 --> 08:33.987
Today, you're 12 or 13.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.974
You're... I have grandchildren that are...

08:39.781 --> 08:43.625
Nine and ten years old, they're infants, you know.

08:43.645 --> 08:43.905
That's right.

08:43.925 --> 08:48.590
We have our daughters who are eight and seven, and, you know, they're in first and second grade.

08:48.610 --> 08:58.721
Well, you know, if you have daughters, I have nieces, but I have six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

08:59.702 --> 08:59.862
Wow.

09:01.464 --> 09:02.625
So, you're 12 or 13.

09:02.665 --> 09:07.009
How did you know it was books that this was going to be your interest in them?

09:07.029 --> 09:07.610
I didn't know.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.691
I made a living at it.

09:09.194 --> 09:10.717
So really, it was neat.

09:11.238 --> 09:14.445
It wasn't love, shall we say, or obsession or fascination.

09:14.465 --> 09:15.246
It wasn't love.

09:15.387 --> 09:19.395
I got into it, and I pursued it.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.780
And you went to Boston, you said?

09:21.880 --> 09:27.351
I went to Boston to a sale, and I attended every sale here in New York and in Philadelphia.

09:27.371 --> 09:27.692
Wow.

09:28.853 --> 09:32.576
Did you know a lot of these people whose libraries were disposed of?

09:33.037 --> 09:35.579
Like, for instance, let's start with the Great Hole auction, for instance.

09:35.599 --> 09:36.620
Well, I didn't know Hole.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.501
You didn't know Hole, but did you know Morgan?

09:38.681 --> 09:39.342
Did you know J.P.

09:39.382 --> 09:39.802
Morgan?

09:39.882 --> 09:41.124
Oh, yes, yeah.

09:41.184 --> 09:43.666
Tell me about him as a collector.

09:44.326 --> 09:51.312
Well, he was a— How would you compare him to Bradley Martin, shall we say, in terms of— Well, there was a difference there, you see.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.515
There was a difference in collecting.

09:55.276 --> 09:57.898
Bradley was a more cultured man.

09:59.870 --> 10:09.481
Would you say then that perhaps Morgan was closer to an accumulator than a collector?

10:09.501 --> 10:12.745
No, but he had his mind set for certain things, you see.

10:12.765 --> 10:15.347
He was a very rich man, you know.

10:15.428 --> 10:16.108
Obviously, you know.

10:16.128 --> 10:17.830
And so was Huntington, of course.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.332
So was Huntington.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.254
Huntington revolutionized book buying.

10:21.314 --> 10:23.116
He used to be bought on block.

10:23.136 --> 10:23.597
On block.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.759
The phrase came in with him, didn't it?

10:25.779 --> 10:26.200
That's right.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.083
So within four or five years, he was able to put together

10:29.755 --> 10:30.656
He bought everything.

10:31.056 --> 10:31.457
Everything.

10:33.399 --> 10:36.723
And did you ever meet any of these people, Huntington or Morgan?

10:37.243 --> 10:42.309
No, I've met Morgan's brother, Henry Morgan.

10:43.109 --> 10:49.096
I had some letters from him, yeah.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.038
But the other collectors I knew as well.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.763
Who would you say are some of the great collectors alive today?

10:57.076 --> 11:00.259
Do they compare with the collectors of the Golden Age?

11:00.640 --> 11:01.360
Well, I wouldn't know.

11:01.801 --> 11:06.426
Dealers had certain, you know.

11:06.446 --> 11:10.390
Well, from what you can see, I mean, this Richard Manny, for instance, who bought the Shakespeare's.

11:10.790 --> 11:11.791
Yeah, yeah.

11:11.811 --> 11:13.573
I guess he's moving pretty quickly, isn't he?

11:13.593 --> 11:15.195
He's moving very heavily, thank you.

11:15.375 --> 11:15.715
Two million.

11:15.735 --> 11:16.196
Two million.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.617
That's right.

11:17.637 --> 11:18.278
1.9 plus the, you know.

11:18.318 --> 11:19.539
Plus the commission.

11:19.559 --> 11:21.061
The commission, yeah.

11:21.822 --> 11:24.404
I mean, he was sitting right next to me at the sale when he bought it.

11:25.125 --> 11:25.506
He was?

11:25.726 --> 11:25.986
Yeah.

11:26.236 --> 11:26.997
What were you thinking?

11:27.037 --> 11:28.679
I mean, they were going up for $50,000 pops.

11:30.221 --> 11:31.342
He has a dealer.

11:31.362 --> 11:32.404
Jim Cummins.

11:32.424 --> 11:33.044
Jim Cummins.

11:33.705 --> 11:37.610
Jim was sitting next to me, and he was sitting right next to Jim.

11:38.251 --> 11:41.695
And he'd tell him, go ahead, Jim.

11:41.715 --> 11:42.936
What was going through your mind?

11:42.956 --> 11:47.522
Now, you were at the wholesale where the Gutenberg Bible sold for $50,000.

11:47.682 --> 11:51.807
And that was considered the greatest, the most, the greatest thing that ever happened.

11:51.827 --> 11:53.529
And that price stood for years and years.

11:53.670 --> 11:54.050
That's right.

11:54.070 --> 11:55.652
And here, you're at an auction.

11:55.987 --> 11:58.409
where the increments are $50,000.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.833
I mean, what do you think when you see what has happened in your lifetime?

12:02.853 --> 12:03.554
I can't think.

12:04.235 --> 12:10.400
I sold things to people where they come up at auction and they bring 40 to 50 times.

12:13.643 --> 12:15.125
What they bought them for.

12:15.285 --> 12:15.605
Yeah.

12:16.145 --> 12:17.847
What you sold them for.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.129
Sure.

12:20.149 --> 12:20.930
I could prove it.

12:21.110 --> 12:24.373
I could give you examples of things that

12:24.775 --> 12:36.908
Well, that went for three million.

12:36.968 --> 12:38.970
How much?

12:38.990 --> 12:41.893
Didn't the Japanese buy it for three million or something like that?

12:41.913 --> 12:42.353
No, no.

12:42.794 --> 12:45.997
Three million nine hundred dollars, almost four million dollars.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.300
Twenty-nine thousand dollars.

12:49.381 --> 12:50.462
My God, you're so confused.

12:51.623 --> 12:53.125
And it was a perfect copy, too.

12:53.165 --> 12:56.069
The finest copy I've ever seen.

12:56.089 --> 12:59.294
Did he request that particular copy from you?

12:59.314 --> 13:01.197
Did he ask you to purchase that copy for him?

13:01.217 --> 13:03.180
Yeah, that particular copy she's asking.

13:03.420 --> 13:04.442
That particular copy?

13:04.482 --> 13:06.084
No, not that particular copy.

13:06.484 --> 13:09.950
He sent me to Philadelphia to look at a copy.

13:11.432 --> 13:14.196
And I went there, spent all day, and I came back.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.681
He was living at that time on a certain place.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.685
And I said, Bradley, this is not your...

13:21.188 --> 13:29.597
This is not your quality, because when you turned the pages, they were torn, and they were spotted.

13:29.617 --> 13:33.301
And I said, look, there's one in London I could buy for $29,000.

13:33.381 --> 13:35.624
Let me buy that one for you.

13:35.644 --> 13:36.585
So I ordered it.

13:36.605 --> 13:37.246
So he said, fine.

13:37.606 --> 13:37.786
Sure.

13:38.427 --> 13:40.469
How much was the one in Philadelphia going for?

13:40.489 --> 13:40.950
$21,000.

13:41.310 --> 13:43.612
So we're talking $8,000.

13:43.632 --> 13:46.155
But $8,000 was a lot of money in those days.

13:46.876 --> 13:48.698
But he wanted the perfect copy.

13:50.467 --> 13:51.528
And look what it went for.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.371
Any other examples like that?

13:54.411 --> 14:02.458
That's quite an extraordinary... No, I mean, there are lots of things that he bought.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.944
Actually, I can get that stuff out of the catalog.

14:08.964 --> 14:10.406
I think that's in the catalog.

14:10.626 --> 14:11.987
I have the catalogs at home.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.610
Well, there's a new catalog that's going to be out now.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.012
I wrote the introduction to this.

14:17.032 --> 14:18.313
Oh, really?

14:18.783 --> 14:20.966
For the one that's coming down in a couple weeks?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.148
Or the one that's coming down at the end of January?

14:23.208 --> 14:24.290
That's right.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.812
The big one, the Americano one?

14:25.832 --> 14:26.072
Yeah.

14:26.272 --> 14:28.955
Oh, that's supposed to be a wonderful auction.

14:28.975 --> 14:29.076
Yeah.

14:29.096 --> 14:29.997
I'm going to come to that.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.498
I'm going to seek you out.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.100
I might even sit near you.

14:33.221 --> 14:36.344
Come on, sit with me.

14:36.364 --> 14:37.526
So you haven't missed any of them?

14:38.287 --> 14:38.547
No.

14:39.388 --> 14:40.529
Did you know Jerome Curran?

14:41.130 --> 14:44.935
No, I knew him well and knew his lawyer.

14:45.055 --> 14:47.558
How do you explain a collector like Curran?

14:48.230 --> 14:53.196
I guess what I'm driving at is because he decided to give everything up, to get rid of everything.

14:54.217 --> 15:01.166
Well, things were at that peak, you know, and he sold everything.

15:02.047 --> 15:06.393
And then he went in again for collecting.

15:06.413 --> 15:07.274
It wasn't the same.

15:07.854 --> 15:17.106
Do you think that he typifies a lot of the kind of collector who the drive is to acquire?

15:17.508 --> 15:20.031
And once you have it, you almost lose interest in it?

15:20.271 --> 15:23.155
I had a customer that came in years ago, 1929.

15:23.836 --> 15:32.887
I got him interested and walked with me, Charles Feinberg.

15:32.907 --> 15:34.709
And he just died.

15:34.729 --> 15:38.454
He gave his whole collection to the Library of Congress.

15:39.315 --> 15:40.216
I know that, yeah.

15:40.416 --> 15:40.717
What?

15:40.737 --> 15:41.518
I've heard that.

15:42.519 --> 15:44.882
He was your customer?

15:46.263 --> 15:50.327
There wasn't a day in the week that he didn't talk to me, you know.

15:50.347 --> 15:53.990
I'd buy all this stuff for him.

15:54.010 --> 15:54.971
I'd buy it everywhere.

15:57.313 --> 15:59.515
Did you get him the first Leaves of Grass?

15:59.955 --> 16:00.656
Yeah.

16:00.796 --> 16:04.439
That's one of the toughest American books there is to get.

16:04.459 --> 16:05.881
There's been dozens around.

16:05.901 --> 16:06.801
Bradley has one.

16:08.163 --> 16:12.106
We're talking about a book that's probably going to go for $150,000, $200,000, maybe more.

16:12.266 --> 16:13.948
Leaves of Grass?

16:14.128 --> 16:14.228
Yeah.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.793
The first one now, the privately printed one.

16:17.813 --> 16:18.614
1855.

16:18.734 --> 16:18.934
Right.

16:19.174 --> 16:20.576
That's right.

16:20.996 --> 16:23.398
Well, how much do you think that's going to go for in fine condition?

16:23.418 --> 16:25.340
$25,000.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.963
That's all.

16:27.983 --> 16:30.365
I thought that would command more than that.

16:33.869 --> 16:40.295
I lost my ... Well, would you say that Kern was buying as an investor or as a collector?

16:41.276 --> 16:42.617
He was buying as a collector.

16:42.637 --> 16:43.438
He was buying both.

16:45.511 --> 16:51.765
What do you think of people who buy for investment purposes as opposed to... Oh, that's a gamble you're taking.

16:52.246 --> 16:55.332
That's a pure gamble you're taking, you know.

16:56.274 --> 16:58.219
I mean, but what do you think of people who do that?

16:58.680 --> 17:01.065
I don't bother with people like that.

17:01.085 --> 17:02.929
If you want to buy for an investment, that's it.

17:02.949 --> 17:03.891
You're down on Wall Street.

17:07.364 --> 17:29.088
We're talking about the difference between the person who buys, say, a Van Gogh for $40,000 or $50,000 million.

17:29.128 --> 17:33.172
The difference between the art collector and the book collector.

17:33.473 --> 17:34.353
There is no debt deal.

17:34.394 --> 17:35.615
You can't.

17:35.635 --> 17:36.696
They're two different things.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.342
Are they two different kinds of collector?

17:40.402 --> 17:42.443
They're two different kinds of collector.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.965
How would you describe the difference?

17:44.185 --> 17:49.810
Well, for instance, I had a customer whose name was Sang, Phil Sang, in Chicago.

17:52.232 --> 17:57.817
He started buying small things, you know, signatures and so on.

17:57.837 --> 18:04.543
Turned out to be one of the great collectors of autographs.

18:04.563 --> 18:06.605
He had a sale that brought over a million.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.286
S-A-N-G?

18:08.536 --> 18:14.381
Yes.

18:14.401 --> 18:18.505
And the point being compared, like, to art, though, the painting?

18:18.525 --> 18:21.728
No, you see, you can't compare that.

18:21.748 --> 18:26.313
I mean, you can't compare a man that buys a picture that wants to hang up on the wall.

18:26.733 --> 18:27.334
It's an ornament.

18:27.714 --> 18:37.463
It's an ornament to a man who wants to buy a letter because he was a great man, you know, because he was

18:39.974 --> 18:41.356
He gave something to the lawyer.

18:41.376 --> 18:44.781
I see what you're saying.

18:44.801 --> 18:50.389
One of the ironies, I think, of the book or manuscript collector is that you buy these things and you really can never touch them.

18:50.509 --> 18:54.014
I mean, you leave, you don't display them, shall we say.

18:54.454 --> 18:54.895
That's right.

18:56.017 --> 19:00.022
And in many cases, you'll find the book collector is very private.

19:00.042 --> 19:02.406
He doesn't even want anybody to know that he owns these things.

19:02.946 --> 19:07.072
Whereas the owner of a great painting, everybody just walks into the house, looks at it.

19:07.192 --> 19:07.753
Looks at it.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.241
Now, how about yourself?

19:10.281 --> 19:11.363
Have you ever been a collector?

19:12.204 --> 19:15.770
I was interested in folklore myself.

19:16.251 --> 19:17.953
I had a little collection, which I sold.

19:18.134 --> 19:19.916
I mean, you know, it was getting beyond me.

19:20.237 --> 19:24.183
I was too busy in the business, and I was traveling all over the world.

19:24.203 --> 19:31.855
I used to go to Europe five, six, seven, eight times a year, ten times a year sometimes.

19:31.875 --> 19:32.476
To buy books?

19:32.876 --> 19:34.118
Yeah.

19:34.138 --> 19:36.482
Did you buy from estates, or you went to auctions?

19:36.502 --> 19:37.183
I went to auctions.

19:38.918 --> 19:40.280
Do you like buying at auction?

19:41.501 --> 19:46.427
I was a very heavy buyer at auction years ago, very heavy.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.490
What kind of instincts do you work with?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.256
It's something that you know.

19:53.336 --> 20:00.825
You have clients and you think that this man ought to be interested in that.

20:00.845 --> 20:03.929
So you buy it or buy it for him.

20:03.949 --> 20:08.014
Do you buy often just on speculation with the thought?

20:08.787 --> 20:10.108
That you might have a client?

20:10.128 --> 20:12.892
Of course you are, of course, of course.

20:12.912 --> 20:19.058
I mean, let's say that you were bidding on the Shakespeare's, and Manny wasn't there with you.

20:19.078 --> 20:22.682
I don't know whether I would have gone that high.

20:22.702 --> 20:23.263
I don't know.

20:23.283 --> 20:25.526
I mean, that's a lot of money for the Shakespeare's.

20:25.546 --> 20:26.126
That's a lot of money.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.269
Because Shakespeare is as wonderful as they are.

20:28.329 --> 20:29.190
They're not rare books.

20:29.210 --> 20:36.658
There was one a year ago, was sold for $600 and some odd thousand dollars.

20:36.678 --> 20:37.579
This very set.

20:38.065 --> 20:39.587
Crouse had it last.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.310
I called it Crouse.

20:41.330 --> 20:44.975
And they had it listed in their catalog just 15 years ago for $165,000.

20:44.995 --> 20:45.937
There you go.

20:46.057 --> 20:49.382
And the thing went up to $2 million.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.866
You know, I mean, how can you explain things?

20:52.206 --> 20:54.690
It's very difficult.

20:54.710 --> 20:57.655
And yet, how high do you... I don't know.

20:57.975 --> 20:58.436
I don't know.

20:59.217 --> 21:03.263
It all depends how well you're in with your clients.

21:04.778 --> 21:07.662
And it helps that the client's there with you, too, doesn't it?

21:07.682 --> 21:10.967
It helps that the client's there with you.

21:10.987 --> 21:13.230
You answered the question.

21:13.250 --> 21:21.662
But have you ever gone to any of these auctions where they don't... The client doesn't really want the competition to know who he is, who's buying it.

21:21.682 --> 21:22.083
Oh, yes.

21:22.143 --> 21:26.048
Lots of people don't want their names mentioned.

21:26.068 --> 21:28.091
Nicholas Barker, you know Nicholas Barker?

21:28.151 --> 21:31.176
I did an interview with him a few weeks ago from the British Library.

21:32.077 --> 21:32.197
Yeah.

21:32.217 --> 21:32.878
He said...

21:33.145 --> 21:42.277
He feels that you can really tell the climate of the market more by the underbidder than the one who gets the prize.

21:43.899 --> 21:49.046
In other words, we don't know how high Manny would have been willing to go to get those Shakespeare's.

21:49.106 --> 21:51.589
I don't think he would have gone any higher.

21:52.170 --> 21:52.811
He quit, right?

21:52.831 --> 21:53.872
Because he hesitated.

21:53.952 --> 21:55.915
Remember John said, think about it?

21:56.095 --> 21:58.278
I was sitting right there, man.

21:59.079 --> 22:02.123
I was sitting as close to him, closer than I'm sitting to you.

22:02.609 --> 22:04.692
And I heard the conversation going on.

22:04.712 --> 22:05.493
What were they saying?

22:06.194 --> 22:08.357
You know, you just go ahead, you know.

22:08.377 --> 22:09.699
Yeah, but he told them to think about it.

22:09.779 --> 22:13.924
He was ready to— And he put his hand up, you know, and— And that was that.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.431
So, in other words, this was it, two million, and then I'm out.

22:18.691 --> 22:20.053
I wonder who he was bidding against.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.096
That would be nice to know who the competition was.

22:22.256 --> 22:22.917
Well, I don't know.

22:23.037 --> 22:23.858
Dr. Gallery could tell you.

22:24.091 --> 22:30.638
It was a telephone bidder, but it was... Maybe a telephone bid, I don't know.

22:30.658 --> 22:31.959
Yeah, but Quaritch wasn't in that.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.961
Quaritch was buying pretty much everything else.

22:34.082 --> 22:36.144
He was buying a lot of stuff, Quaritch.

22:36.304 --> 22:41.149
Yeah, he got the Cervantes for, I'm told, for a Spanish collector, is what I heard.

22:41.169 --> 22:43.612
Yeah, you buy for people, you know, like I used to do.

22:44.713 --> 22:51.600
But you see, I'm not so heavy in buying today, because at my age,

22:52.694 --> 22:55.598
I just hang on with a few people.

22:57.301 --> 22:57.401
Yeah.

22:57.982 --> 23:04.191
But I hear the book Grapevine out there that you're still pretty well involved in this.

23:04.331 --> 23:05.453
Of course I'm involved.

23:05.513 --> 23:06.635
I'm always involved.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.340
I'm involved all the time, and I will always be involved.

23:11.822 --> 23:14.927
I'm told you know where all the great books are, all the great pages.

23:14.967 --> 23:15.267
That's right.

23:15.327 --> 23:21.857
I know where a lot of the books are, and I know where collections that I've made that would give it away to institutions.

23:22.816 --> 23:27.022
Well, that must be satisfying to some degree.

23:27.903 --> 23:28.203
You know?

23:28.524 --> 23:32.810
Like, for instance, which collections have been given to institutions that you can think of offhand?

23:32.850 --> 23:36.014
Well, a man by the name of Hugh Peele gave this whole collection.

23:36.034 --> 23:36.675
Famous, yeah.

23:36.695 --> 23:38.858
Yeah, gave this whole collection, you know, it's in Kentucky.

23:39.199 --> 23:40.340
That's a famous collection.

23:40.661 --> 23:40.761
Sure.

23:40.901 --> 23:42.002
You built that collection?

23:43.865 --> 23:43.965
Yeah.

23:43.985 --> 23:46.889
These are very famous collections he's mentioning.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.271
I haven't had all of them.

23:48.471 --> 23:51.135
Great collection of Charles and Mary Lamb.

23:51.807 --> 23:52.308
Oh, my.

23:52.368 --> 23:54.050
Was that original manuscript style?

23:54.070 --> 23:54.451
Yeah, that's right.

23:55.412 --> 23:56.193
And where did that go?

23:56.233 --> 24:00.559
That went to Kentucky.

24:00.579 --> 24:00.779
Yeah.

24:01.641 --> 24:06.888
Do you kind of have mixed emotions when you see it go to an institution, and then you know it's never going to be offered again?

24:06.908 --> 24:07.489
Of course.

24:08.150 --> 24:11.574
Because as a dealer, you might like to say, geez, I'd like to have another whack at that.

24:11.935 --> 24:13.277
Well, you may or may not.

24:13.357 --> 24:16.261
I mean, all the things you see.

24:16.281 --> 24:20.667
You see, the market has changed so dramatically, so dramatically.

24:22.604 --> 24:29.416
in the last five years, that sometimes I don't recognize what's going on.

24:29.436 --> 24:30.878
Talk to me a little bit about that.

24:30.898 --> 24:32.461
How has it changed, not just the money?

24:32.561 --> 24:34.645
Are you talking just in terms of the value, or...?

24:34.845 --> 24:38.191
I'm talking about money value, dollar-wise.

24:39.693 --> 24:41.997
But the institutions aren't buying as much.

24:42.498 --> 24:47.667
It's the private collector who's... Well, the private collector has more money than he ever had before.

24:48.001 --> 24:50.203
And the institutions don't have what they used to have.

24:50.303 --> 24:54.167
And the institutions don't have what they used to have.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.928
That's about the nutshell of it, right there.

24:55.948 --> 24:57.149
That's the whole thing, right there.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.451
That's what I wrote for this Sunday.

24:59.491 --> 25:05.757
That's the essence of what I said, is that David Redden feels that we're in a new golden age of book collecting.

25:05.777 --> 25:06.678
Would you agree with that?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.763
Well, yes and no.

25:14.324 --> 25:17.147
Don't forget you don't have as many

25:17.397 --> 25:19.400
book sales as there were years ago.

25:22.784 --> 25:28.492
And the money is freer.

25:29.753 --> 25:30.074
Today?

25:30.394 --> 25:30.674
Yeah.

25:31.395 --> 25:32.577
What do you mean freer, looser?

25:32.957 --> 25:36.722
Looser, I mean, people are willing to throw it around.

25:36.943 --> 25:38.324
People are willing to, that's right.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.327
You think that, I mean, is that correct?

25:40.347 --> 25:41.328
Is that a correct assumption?

25:41.348 --> 25:43.051
That's right.

25:43.071 --> 25:43.331
That's right.

25:43.351 --> 25:44.873
And you say it amazes you to see it.

25:45.241 --> 25:58.258
It amazes me to see it because being in the business for the many years that I've been in, sometimes it was hard to sell a client, you know, and he's got to figure out where the money is going to come from, you know.

25:58.298 --> 25:59.900
But today it seems to be.

26:02.844 --> 26:06.930
Do you find, now my regular job is I'm a book review editor.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.074
I'm the book review editor of the Worcester Telegram in Massachusetts.

26:10.254 --> 26:11.055
Oh.

26:11.075 --> 26:12.036
And I review books.

26:12.096 --> 26:14.860
I'm a critic as well as a writer of collecting.

26:15.548 --> 26:23.516
And I find, and the reason I say this is that I find, having done this for 12 years now, that when I get, I feel that I know people.

26:25.218 --> 26:25.658
You're just a baby.

26:25.678 --> 26:26.379
That's nice to hear.

26:26.399 --> 26:27.660
You're just an infant.

26:27.681 --> 26:30.844
You're an infant.

26:30.864 --> 26:32.065
You've made my day.

26:32.866 --> 26:38.291
I feel that to know a person is to know their reading habits.

26:38.452 --> 26:39.172
Well, of course.

26:39.192 --> 26:41.915
And do you feel the same way as a book dealer?

26:41.935 --> 26:42.356
That's right.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.678
I mean, that almost, that you can almost,

26:45.367 --> 26:48.570
consider yourself something of a psychiatrist.

26:48.790 --> 26:50.471
That's perhaps a little too strong.

26:50.632 --> 26:52.513
That's a little bit too strong, you know.

26:52.653 --> 26:53.974
But a confidant, certainly.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.716
That's different.

26:55.936 --> 27:00.040
You have a window into the person's... See, let me give you an example.

27:01.361 --> 27:04.704
I've got it right here, which I'm working on now.

27:04.724 --> 27:05.084
Wonderful.

27:05.104 --> 27:08.247
There was a man by the name of Litauer.

27:11.469 --> 27:12.891
That name's familiar for some reason.

27:13.611 --> 27:14.412
And he was...

27:15.286 --> 27:24.117
He was a taught riding, horse riding, at a big place in Long Island.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.601
Known all over the world.

27:29.644 --> 27:35.491
You know, his riding, teaching people how to saddle and ride a horse.

27:35.511 --> 27:36.292
Austrian arts.

27:36.653 --> 27:37.153
That's right.

27:39.736 --> 27:43.581
I met him about, oh, I don't know, 30, 40 years ago.

27:44.542 --> 27:45.023
He died.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.309
And you see, here is this collection which I have to appraise.

27:52.940 --> 28:00.582
And he's got books from the

28:18.770 --> 28:21.633
He's got books from the 15th century.

28:22.013 --> 28:23.695
Wow, 15th century.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.340
These are even pre-incunibles, aren't they?

28:28.400 --> 28:29.642
I mean, incunibles.

28:29.702 --> 28:37.610
1632, 1623, 1685, 1619.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.654
Then he goes on.

28:41.995 --> 28:43.356
So this fellow's name is Liddauer?

28:43.596 --> 28:43.897
Yeah.

28:43.997 --> 28:44.657
Is he an American?

28:46.119 --> 28:47.140
Or did he say British?

28:47.812 --> 28:51.176
I don't know what he was, but he wasn't, he was a poet.

28:52.998 --> 29:05.892
And then he's got... And then he's got the modern books, you know.

29:07.394 --> 29:11.899
So he really covers the subject.

29:11.919 --> 29:13.521
Yeah.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.203
Now, are you appraising this?

29:15.723 --> 29:16.664
For the estate.

29:16.684 --> 29:19.848
For the estate, which probably intends to put it up for auction, is that?

29:20.128 --> 29:22.010
No, I don't know what she's going to do.

29:22.371 --> 29:23.712
I spoke to Mrs. Liddow.

29:25.314 --> 29:32.182
This is interesting, and I'm not talking about the, and this is not with respect to the Liddowers, or anyone specifically.

29:32.202 --> 29:36.127
There's a collection of books that I have to do on the Vietnam War.

29:36.768 --> 29:38.469
That's a very interesting subject now.

29:38.490 --> 29:38.750
See?

29:39.871 --> 29:42.274
See?

29:42.294 --> 29:43.636
Only on the Vietnam War.

29:43.896 --> 29:44.937
How do you appraise these?

29:45.642 --> 29:47.264
When there really isn't a bibliography.

29:47.704 --> 29:59.339
There is a bibliography, but most of these are out of print, and you kind of put a, you know, you get a feeling of what a book is worth, and you put a price on it, and a collection.

29:59.599 --> 30:02.222
You could put a bigger price than an individual book.

30:02.903 --> 30:03.864
Because it's a collection.

30:04.024 --> 30:05.246
Because it's a collection.

30:05.266 --> 30:07.909
Because it's the easy way to get the whole thing fast.

30:09.491 --> 30:13.776
If you've got all of Dickens, all of Dickens is worth more than

30:14.043 --> 30:16.626
than all of Dickens in individual segments.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.710
Probably twice, actually.

30:19.730 --> 30:23.075
Isn't that what the figure is, generally, sometimes?

30:23.795 --> 30:25.117
How about taste and fashion?

30:25.958 --> 30:27.500
You say you've seen the market change.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.923
How about taste and fashion in book collecting?

30:30.384 --> 30:31.445
Have you seen that change?

30:31.746 --> 30:32.987
Yes, it changes.

30:33.007 --> 30:34.069
Sure, that changes.

30:35.510 --> 30:43.020
At one time, a North, you couldn't sell a North, but all of a sudden,

30:43.439 --> 30:48.206
something happened and the world runs and tries to buy it.

30:49.808 --> 30:52.552
Well, Melville was like that for the longest time, wasn't he?

30:52.572 --> 30:55.657
Well, I sold Bradley Melville's Bible.

30:57.239 --> 30:57.880
God, he used.

30:58.802 --> 31:04.510
He's got a little story that just popped out, didn't he?

31:06.052 --> 31:08.596
Coming up at sale, I think.

31:08.656 --> 31:10.759
Now, where did you find Melville's Bible?

31:11.080 --> 31:13.243
I found it in Joliet, Illinois.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.222
And how did you get wind of it?

31:16.242 --> 31:27.837
Well, a customer of mine who was an autograph collector came to his house one night, and there I saw this and some other medical things, and I bought them all and I sold them to Brasley.

31:27.957 --> 31:29.900
Did he know what he had, the guy?

31:29.920 --> 31:33.504
Oh, sure, sure.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.308
You must have a million stories about extraordinary finds.

31:36.569 --> 31:39.052
Oh, yes, I have a million stories.

31:40.614 --> 31:42.977
I was going to look for a list here.

31:44.054 --> 31:45.877
I suppose this is in another file.

31:47.259 --> 31:51.765
I gave Bradley a list of the library that I bought.

31:51.785 --> 31:54.409
He was sitting where you're sitting.

31:54.429 --> 31:58.414
And he went through it, and he used to mark H-B-N.

31:58.474 --> 32:00.778
He marked it H-B-N.

32:01.999 --> 32:04.884
And he marked it on the edge, H-B-N, H-B-N.

32:05.384 --> 32:07.247
When I brought the library in... Very easy, wasn't it?

32:07.688 --> 32:07.928
Yes.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.872
When I brought the library in, there were eight or ten

32:11.678 --> 32:15.243
part of the whole group, you know, that had his mark.

32:15.263 --> 32:16.765
And I put him in front of him.

32:17.246 --> 32:22.152
It came to 18,000-something, I don't remember the exact amount.

32:22.172 --> 32:25.517
And he took his wallet out and he wrote a check out.

32:25.817 --> 32:27.840
And they carried him out?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.362
Yeah.

32:29.422 --> 32:30.323
Did he love books?

32:30.383 --> 32:31.084
He loved books.

32:31.124 --> 32:35.731
Did something happen to him when he, I mean, that you could see when he came in contact with a great book?

32:35.751 --> 32:36.311
He loved books.

32:37.673 --> 32:38.935
I guess I'm looking for

32:39.286 --> 32:47.358
some kind of insight into what it is that really transforms a person into what we call bibliomaniacs.

32:48.039 --> 32:49.441
Do you have any thoughts on that?

32:50.323 --> 32:52.125
I'm not a physician.

32:52.206 --> 32:52.746
I don't know.

32:52.867 --> 32:54.509
I'm not a psychiatrist.

32:55.070 --> 32:58.715
I don't know what can... But motivation, I guess, is what I mean.

32:58.735 --> 33:02.701
You must have some sense as to what motivates people to do this.

33:02.721 --> 33:06.407
Well, it's a thing that...

33:06.961 --> 33:08.523
It's a lot for a thing, you know.

33:08.643 --> 33:12.567
You start with one, then you get two, then you get three, then you get four.

33:12.587 --> 33:17.172
And you say, well, I'll add to it to see myself.

33:17.192 --> 33:20.456
Yeah, but for instance, now you're talking about the equestrian collection.

33:21.037 --> 33:22.658
Here's the wife having it appraised.

33:23.599 --> 33:28.885
She, I would imagine, didn't share the same enthusiasm for the subject as the husband did.

33:28.905 --> 33:31.348
Of course not.

33:31.700 --> 33:42.314
Well, that was his profession, his occupation, but Bradley certainly wasn't a bird, he wasn't an ornithological of what, how do you put it?

33:42.334 --> 33:46.840
He wasn't a bird specialist, yet he loved books about birds, you know, finest collections.

33:46.901 --> 33:49.744
Well, he started with reading W.H.

33:50.525 --> 34:00.559
Hudson, you know, as a naturalist, and he pulled out a book, and with that we started, and it just went on and on and on.

34:00.927 --> 34:03.210
There'll never be another collection like it.

34:03.851 --> 34:06.915
That is a shame.

34:07.376 --> 34:17.089
And I understand that he actually, there was something in the will that, that it wasn't clear, but he did give the trust the option to sell it as a unit.

34:17.109 --> 34:19.932
I have a copy of his will here.

34:19.952 --> 34:20.353
Yeah?

34:20.705 --> 34:24.669
Yes, it's all going to the trust of the Bessemer Trust.

34:24.689 --> 34:25.330
The Bessemer Trust.

34:25.370 --> 34:25.890
Yes.

34:25.910 --> 34:30.135
And I guess their position is, their responsibility is to maximize the estate.

34:31.015 --> 34:33.097
That's right, and to take care of the family.

34:33.258 --> 34:34.419
Don't forget that.

34:34.979 --> 34:36.901
But of course, the family's not bad at all.

34:36.921 --> 34:39.204
No, of course not.

34:39.224 --> 34:43.188
I mean, it's not like they need the proceeds of that library for their livelihood.

34:43.788 --> 34:43.928
Ms.

34:43.988 --> 34:50.475
Bessemer was Bessemer Steele.

34:50.945 --> 34:57.233
two children with a prison wife, Alice and Bradley, Jr.

34:58.474 --> 35:07.645
And he has one daughter left from the first union.

35:07.665 --> 35:08.086
How about yourself?

35:08.106 --> 35:08.867
Do you love books?

35:09.087 --> 35:09.908
I do.

35:10.028 --> 35:11.410
I've been with books all my life.

35:11.630 --> 35:13.692
I think books all the time.

35:13.712 --> 35:17.777
But I mean, you love them beyond the fact that it's your profession, that it's just something that you pick up.

35:17.797 --> 35:20.901
I wonder if you could tell me what a book means to you.

35:21.590 --> 35:28.677
I do take the same pride, say, in building Bradley Martin's collection as Bradley Martin took in building it and owning it.

35:29.057 --> 35:31.400
That's right.

35:31.540 --> 35:32.100
Same way.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.602
I mean, that's a fair statement?

35:33.622 --> 35:36.144
That's a fair statement.

35:36.164 --> 35:44.933
And so when you got him the better Audubon, you felt good, not only because he got a better Audubon, but you felt I got a better Audubon.

35:45.013 --> 35:46.034
That's true.

35:46.054 --> 35:46.394
That's right.

35:46.414 --> 35:47.135
Am I in the right?

35:47.495 --> 35:50.078
I wouldn't let him buy the other one.

35:50.362 --> 35:56.569
One of the responsibilities that you acquire, I guess, as a dealer over the... You know, you've got to know your customer.

35:56.589 --> 35:56.689
Yeah.

35:56.709 --> 36:00.473
And you've got to know how much money he's got to afford to go.

36:01.834 --> 36:04.317
I guess, you know, integrity is everything.

36:04.617 --> 36:05.958
Of course.

36:06.079 --> 36:12.145
You know, you wouldn't... I don't know, your financial secretary, but would you go out and buy something for $100,000?

36:14.067 --> 36:17.471
I certainly don't have the wherewithal to do that, but... All right, there you go.

36:17.491 --> 36:19.693
But you're in life, you know.

36:20.922 --> 36:36.277
But I think what we're saying is these people came to trust you, not only for your knowledge of books, but for the fact that you were going to give them a very honest evaluation of what it was worth.

36:36.417 --> 36:47.649
I mean, you hear it said that certain collectors single-handedly, because of their indiscriminate buying, were responsible for the market going crazy.

36:47.669 --> 36:49.090
Of course.

36:49.441 --> 36:56.009
Because a dealer will say, hey, there's a guy in New York who buys modern first American books.

36:56.490 --> 36:58.452
And he'll pay anything for it.

36:58.933 --> 37:03.038
So all of a sudden, they'll go out and they'll buy a Faulkner that maybe ought to go for $2,500.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.421
And they put $5,000, $6,000 on it.

37:06.282 --> 37:09.065
I'm just talking in generalities about it.

37:09.085 --> 37:10.788
Talk about Faulkner.

37:11.368 --> 37:13.451
I had a lady write me a letter.

37:13.471 --> 37:16.495
She said she's got a copy of the marble form.

37:16.755 --> 37:19.178
That was Faulkner's first book.

37:20.204 --> 37:27.812
And I wrote back and I said, yes, I'd be interested in it.

37:27.832 --> 37:29.814
She said, how much would you pay?

37:29.894 --> 37:36.061
I said, I told her, I called her on the phone after I'd written it.

37:36.081 --> 37:38.383
I said, I'd like to see it.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.545
If it's all right, I'll give you $1,000 worth.

37:43.388 --> 37:45.030
So she came clear off of it.

37:47.322 --> 37:55.529
And out of her bag, she sat down, and out of her bag she pulled this thing out, and there was a copy in the dust jacket.

37:58.011 --> 38:04.456
So I wrote her a check right away, and she said, would you buy another one?

38:04.476 --> 38:07.699
And she pulled them out.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.801
Oh, my gosh.

38:09.961 --> 38:10.041
Wow.

38:10.061 --> 38:10.882
She had two of them?

38:11.122 --> 38:16.046
So I said to her, I said, well, here's the story she told me.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.127
She said,

38:17.461 --> 38:21.046
Parker lived in her mother's house in the South.

38:21.066 --> 38:21.567
Wow.

38:21.827 --> 38:28.637
And when this book was published, you know, he gave his, I want his grandmother one, but this one won it.

38:28.857 --> 38:31.320
There's only 70 copies of this book accounted for.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.064
And we're talking about a book that's exceedingly skit.

38:34.244 --> 38:40.533
I just saw it, I just saw it, the Christie sale that you went to a couple weeks ago, they had a marble farm.

38:40.713 --> 38:40.934
Yeah.

38:41.074 --> 38:43.377
And I think they got, they got a pretty good price for it.

38:43.537 --> 38:45.460
I forget, it was $13,000, $14,000, I think.

38:46.435 --> 38:51.342
So you see when things happen, you see how she pulled another one, you know?

38:51.362 --> 38:54.887
It was like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

38:54.907 --> 38:56.229
How long ago is this, roughly?

38:56.529 --> 39:01.796
Oh, this must be 12 years ago, 15 years ago.

39:01.876 --> 39:08.345
And you obviously had clients immediately who would... Oh, yes, I sold them both immediately, the same day as a matter of fact.

39:08.365 --> 39:09.267
Really?

39:09.287 --> 39:15.295
I collect Faulkner, and obviously the Marble Pawn is one... I remember Joyce when you couldn't give Joyce away.

39:16.473 --> 39:23.221
I remember buying 135 letters of Joyce for a paper guy.

39:23.261 --> 39:28.808
A dealer bought them, and he said to me one day, he said, would you want to buy a Joyce collection?

39:28.868 --> 39:30.230
I said, how much is it?

39:30.631 --> 39:32.333
He said, $1,100.

39:32.393 --> 39:35.777
I said, I'll buy it.

39:35.797 --> 39:37.779
So I sold it to a customer of mine.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.001
He eventually sold it.

39:40.002 --> 39:44.708
He eventually sold it to Southern Illinois.

39:45.953 --> 39:46.814
University.

39:47.075 --> 39:49.037
They have a pretty good choice collection.

39:50.279 --> 39:51.320
What do you tell it to them for?

39:52.041 --> 39:52.662
I think 50,000.

39:52.762 --> 39:53.744
Not bad.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.970
Today would bring millions.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.632
Four or five times a million.

39:59.712 --> 40:01.475
I mean, you can't... You can't judge.

40:01.515 --> 40:02.977
You can't look back.

40:03.037 --> 40:04.178
You've got to look forward.

40:04.218 --> 40:07.343
Don't look back, because if you look back, you'll be a sorrowful man.

40:08.404 --> 40:13.311
Well, with that in mind, though, you must have some stories about ones that got away, too.

40:14.371 --> 40:14.692
The one?

40:14.932 --> 40:19.119
You must have some stories about opportunities that you missed.

40:19.139 --> 40:19.299
Oh!

40:21.122 --> 40:22.885
Some that must still hurt a little bit, too.

40:23.627 --> 40:25.510
Oh, can I tell you?

40:25.530 --> 40:26.612
Well, can I tell you?

40:26.632 --> 40:28.856
Well, I mean, what can I tell you?

40:28.876 --> 40:38.592
For instance, I sold Bradley the copy of Washington's copy of The Federalist, which is just Washington.

40:38.612 --> 40:38.953
That's okay.

40:38.973 --> 40:39.854
You don't have to look at it.

40:39.934 --> 40:40.395
No, no, no.

40:48.948 --> 40:49.709
How we doing?

40:50.290 --> 40:51.772
Good.

40:51.792 --> 40:52.413
Oh, here it is.

40:52.613 --> 40:54.476
This is it here.

40:55.016 --> 41:00.324
Here it is in the January 1990 South of the newsletter.

41:00.344 --> 41:01.305
You can take this with you.

41:01.786 --> 41:01.906
Okay.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.588
Well, they're saying $400,000.

41:03.788 --> 41:05.010
I have another copy.

41:06.252 --> 41:07.814
It'll probably go for more than that, right?

41:08.294 --> 41:08.755
I don't know.

41:08.795 --> 41:09.596
That's a question.

41:10.197 --> 41:11.419
But you sold that to Bradley.

41:11.459 --> 41:11.899
Yes.

41:11.919 --> 41:13.502
And it's signed by George Washington.

41:13.982 --> 41:14.323
Yes.

41:14.343 --> 41:17.487
Presented by Madison Brown.

41:18.327 --> 41:19.308
Where did you find that?

41:20.109 --> 41:25.535
Cape of the Hearst estate.

41:25.876 --> 41:28.799
How did you manage to get the inside?

41:28.899 --> 41:30.421
I don't know how.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.103
How about Rosenbach?

41:32.123 --> 41:33.064
Did you know Rosenbach?

41:33.084 --> 41:34.045
Oh, I knew him very well.

41:36.628 --> 41:37.630
I told him one day.

41:37.650 --> 41:39.532
I was sitting up with him in his house.

41:39.632 --> 41:41.734
Was he down in Philadelphia or here?

41:41.754 --> 41:43.517
No, I was in Philadelphia many times.

41:43.617 --> 41:48.182
I said to him one day, I said, you should have died 10 years ago.

41:49.664 --> 41:52.407
So they looked at me.

41:53.307 --> 41:54.949
I said, you would have died a champion.

41:54.969 --> 42:10.783
You see, when these foreign dealers came over to America during the Hitler regime, a lot of them were steeped in bibliography, and they knew the business very well.

42:10.944 --> 42:12.185
They were driven out by Hitler.

42:12.205 --> 42:13.025
They were driven out.

42:13.105 --> 42:16.509
There's been some lectures on this, too, at Columbia.

42:16.549 --> 42:18.050
Sure, of course.

42:18.510 --> 42:19.131
Yeah, go ahead.

42:19.685 --> 42:28.699
Naturally, they took over, because they were steeped in this thing, you know.

42:28.799 --> 42:29.881
In bibliography.

42:29.901 --> 42:30.662
In bibliography.

42:31.583 --> 42:32.905
So what did Rosenbach say?

42:32.925 --> 42:33.706
Oh, he laughed.

42:33.747 --> 42:34.408
But he wasn't?

42:34.428 --> 42:35.830
He said you don't think he knew?

42:35.850 --> 42:36.471
He knew.

42:36.551 --> 42:38.554
He was very, very, very interested.

42:38.674 --> 42:38.834
He knew.

42:39.495 --> 42:41.498
But this is what I told him.

42:41.779 --> 42:43.461
Just like that, I was talking to him.

42:44.243 --> 42:45.184
And this is what I told him.

42:45.204 --> 42:46.526
I said, you should die 10 years.

42:46.546 --> 42:48.409
You're going to die the champion.

42:49.165 --> 42:50.426
This was during the war.

42:50.667 --> 42:50.907
Yeah.

42:50.927 --> 42:55.412
Because he died, I think, around the 50s sometime.

42:55.853 --> 42:57.715
He was a great collector, of course.

42:57.735 --> 42:58.896
Oh, yeah.

42:58.916 --> 43:01.179
You know, he kept... Well, how do you feel about that?

43:01.199 --> 43:03.602
Now, here's a guy who kept a lot of the best things for himself.

43:03.622 --> 43:18.058
I mean, it's hard to... Well, he was very much interested in it, and he collected certain things that he liked.

43:18.882 --> 43:20.885
It's all there in Philadelphia.

43:20.905 --> 43:22.889
It's a little museum.

43:22.909 --> 43:27.516
It's beautiful.

43:27.596 --> 43:28.357
I've been there.

43:28.377 --> 43:28.458
Yes.

43:29.299 --> 43:34.407
I think eventually it will go to the Philadelphia Library.

43:34.427 --> 43:35.369
Do you think so?

43:36.010 --> 43:36.411
Yeah.

43:36.511 --> 43:39.275
I thought they had their own little trusteeship down there.

43:39.295 --> 43:40.958
Well, they have a little trusteeship,

43:41.343 --> 43:43.425
I think that's my opinion.

43:43.485 --> 43:45.807
Well, I sure hope they keep it intact just the way it is.

43:45.827 --> 43:48.530
Well, it'll be intact, but I think it'll go over to them.

43:48.550 --> 43:49.971
Because the house is wonderful.

43:50.292 --> 43:50.612
Oh, yeah.

43:50.632 --> 43:53.955
And his brother's... The one on Delancey Street?

43:54.116 --> 43:54.476
Yeah.

43:54.696 --> 43:56.518
I stayed at that house many a night.

43:56.558 --> 43:56.798
Really?

43:56.818 --> 43:56.898
Yes.

43:57.018 --> 44:00.061
This is where we lived, and it's downtown.

44:00.602 --> 44:04.906
It's like the Philadelphia version of Beacon Hill.

44:04.926 --> 44:05.587
I don't know what they call it.

44:05.607 --> 44:05.907
That's right.

44:05.927 --> 44:09.030
And it's because we're, you know, my wife knows Boston better than she knows.

44:09.070 --> 44:09.831
Oh, you're from Boston?

44:10.098 --> 44:12.661
Well, we're from Massachusetts, Worcester.

44:13.442 --> 44:17.427
Well, I helped the American Jewish Historical Society.

44:18.689 --> 44:19.029
You did?

44:19.049 --> 44:22.073
I have an interesting question about that.

44:22.253 --> 44:25.538
That manuscript that they sold, that they got from Wessing Rosenwald.

44:25.638 --> 44:27.700
Yeah, they got $40,000.

44:27.921 --> 44:28.962
Well, more than that, $176,000.

44:28.982 --> 44:29.302
$170,000.

44:29.583 --> 44:29.943
Yeah.

44:30.003 --> 44:32.346
They sold it at the 70s.

44:32.987 --> 44:33.327
Right.

44:33.388 --> 44:35.570
And then I guess it finally found its way to .

44:35.590 --> 44:35.610
.

44:35.630 --> 44:35.650
.

44:35.710 --> 44:36.932
The Jewish regime.

44:37.064 --> 44:38.225
What do you think about that?

44:38.385 --> 44:39.827
Now, this is a case which .

44:39.947 --> 44:40.468
I don't know.

44:40.668 --> 44:41.649
I question that.

44:41.669 --> 44:42.330
I spoke to .

44:42.630 --> 44:46.354
You know, I was with them for so many years.

44:46.374 --> 44:49.177
I'm on the board, as a matter of fact.

44:49.377 --> 44:50.719
In the .

44:51.159 --> 44:51.480
Really?

44:51.500 --> 44:52.841
You're on the board up there?

44:52.861 --> 44:54.343
Sure.

44:54.363 --> 44:56.185
I mean, I guess they needed the money, certainly.

44:56.425 --> 45:05.535
They said that they needed the money, but they accepted the thing from Rosenwald with the understanding that they would keep it forever.

45:05.836 --> 45:08.059
He bought it to prevent the Nazis from getting it.

45:08.139 --> 45:09.160
That's right.

45:09.180 --> 45:15.889
In fact, he said in his memoirs, it's the only time he ever told Rosenbach, price is no object.

45:15.909 --> 45:16.169
That's right.

45:16.189 --> 45:17.571
Whether that's true or not.

45:17.591 --> 45:17.892
That's true.

45:17.932 --> 45:18.973
It makes for a nice story.

45:19.033 --> 45:20.175
No, that's true.

45:20.395 --> 45:34.273
You know, I was, when Rosenbach's grandson got married, I was invited to the wedding in Chicago, in Chenoweth.

45:37.730 --> 45:41.115
And Lessing and I were sitting at a little table.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.216
We were discussing books.

45:42.317 --> 45:44.079
We had this whole ceremony.

45:47.945 --> 45:49.627
He was very interested.

45:49.827 --> 45:56.717
Another man that had a great letter that was sold at Sotheby's was that famous Jefferson letter.

45:56.737 --> 45:57.178
Oh, yeah.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.825
Now, that came from Pittsburgh.

46:04.509 --> 46:06.792
I saw it hanging in his house at the time.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.382
We're talking about Lessing now.

46:08.662 --> 46:10.846
No, not Lessing, no.

46:10.866 --> 46:14.692
It was, I'll give you his name in a minute, I was hanging this out.

46:14.712 --> 46:19.198
When he died, she put it up at auction, and Jesselson bought it.

46:19.859 --> 46:22.383
Jesselson, very wealthy man.

46:24.406 --> 46:25.789
I think he gave it to Yoshida.

46:27.111 --> 46:31.397
I think so, I'm not sure, but I think that's where it is.

46:31.417 --> 46:35.884
See, I'm really interested in that particular story about Rosenwald.

46:36.303 --> 46:54.885
that anecdote about saying price is no object the essence of this story is he wanted to buy something which he hated because this thing this thing is a famous document that that justifies the persecution of jews it's a viciously anti-semitic document he did not want it to go

46:55.388 --> 47:01.197
And in fact, the underbidders were the Nazis, and they made a big stink about they wanted to open the bidding again.

47:01.898 --> 47:03.099
And he said, no, no, it's mine.

47:03.420 --> 47:07.005
And he thought he hated it so much he didn't put it in his own collection.

47:07.025 --> 47:07.867
No, no.

47:07.887 --> 47:08.608
He gave it away.

47:08.628 --> 47:12.834
He gave it to the Jewish society, and the understanding was it stays here.

47:13.235 --> 47:15.698
We never want this thing to get in the wrong hands.

47:16.279 --> 47:19.624
But they needed the money 50 years later, and they sold it.

47:19.958 --> 47:22.260
So this is why I'm questioning the propriety.

47:22.601 --> 47:24.203
Maybe they should have offered it back to the estate.

47:24.223 --> 47:27.466
Because I don't know what contacts they had between each other.

47:27.886 --> 47:29.869
You see, that's my interest in it.

47:29.909 --> 47:32.271
I don't know what contacts they had between each other.

47:32.932 --> 47:34.093
But how do you feel about that?

47:35.154 --> 47:37.297
I feel it all depends what they told them.

47:39.299 --> 47:44.384
If they told them that they were going to keep it, you know what I mean, then they should have kept it.

47:44.404 --> 47:46.266
Fortunately, it is a yeshiva now.

47:46.386 --> 47:49.129
And so it is in a place where it should be.

47:49.390 --> 47:49.830
That's right.

47:50.198 --> 47:54.582
I mean, that's all you need is for somebody like Gaddafi to get a thing like this.

47:54.602 --> 47:57.265
I mean, these things replicate themselves, you know.

47:58.105 --> 48:08.936
And, you know, so this is... What I would hope in my book, where there's a young kid up in Amherst, Massachusetts, by the name of Aaron Lasky.

48:09.016 --> 48:09.736
You ever heard of him?

48:10.377 --> 48:10.858
He's a kid.

48:10.878 --> 48:11.678
He's in his 30s.

48:12.119 --> 48:18.805
He just got a MacArthur Fellowship, and he started this Yiddish library.

48:19.662 --> 48:23.867
They say he's put together the finest collection of Yiddish and Hebrew things anywhere.

48:23.887 --> 48:25.228
Well, the best collection is YIVO.

48:25.969 --> 48:28.732
Well, how do you spell that?

48:28.752 --> 48:29.173
YIVO is what?

48:29.193 --> 48:29.913
YIVO, YIVO.

48:30.254 --> 48:31.635
Here on New York City.

48:31.996 --> 48:32.236
Yeah?

48:35.039 --> 48:36.701
Do they collect Holocaust things, too?

48:36.721 --> 48:37.081
Sure.

48:37.182 --> 48:38.503
Yeah.

48:38.723 --> 48:40.505
You know who else has a great collection?

48:41.066 --> 48:42.507
The Beck Institute.

48:42.527 --> 48:42.788
Beck.

48:43.368 --> 48:46.272
Leo Beck.

48:46.392 --> 48:46.992
Of what?

48:47.113 --> 48:48.794
Of Yiddish things or Holocaust things?

48:48.814 --> 48:49.315
Holocaust things.

48:49.615 --> 48:51.477
This is an interesting question, you see.

48:51.897 --> 48:53.959
Who collects the horrible things?

48:54.119 --> 48:54.860
They have it.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.361
Leo Beck Institute.

48:56.522 --> 48:57.022
Okay.

48:57.242 --> 49:00.806
I mean, because I think that's a very... 73th Street.

49:00.826 --> 49:03.208
Don't you think that's a very interesting area of collecting?

49:03.548 --> 49:05.050
Not because you like the stuff.

49:05.290 --> 49:06.171
You hate the stuff.

49:06.591 --> 49:08.253
But somebody has to preserve it.

49:08.353 --> 49:09.854
That's right.

49:09.874 --> 49:16.400
And Yibo, Yibo is on 5th Avenue and 86th Street, right on the corner.

49:17.662 --> 49:18.262
That's Yiddish.

49:18.883 --> 49:19.183
Yiddish.

49:19.332 --> 49:20.373
Uh-huh.

49:20.393 --> 49:22.796
Okay.

49:22.816 --> 49:24.077
Leo Beck is not Yiddish.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.040
No, that's Holocaust.

49:26.060 --> 49:30.965
That's Holocaust material and general material.

49:31.646 --> 49:35.931
But Jewish, Yiddish, is Yibo.

49:36.351 --> 49:36.691
Okay.

49:37.152 --> 49:39.374
This is an interesting area for me to pursue.

49:39.535 --> 49:43.880
See, I'm not just talking about collecting and how you collect and how you tell the first edition.

49:44.200 --> 49:44.741
That's silly.

49:44.861 --> 49:46.963
You can learn that anywhere.

49:46.983 --> 49:48.765
I'm trying to talk about the spirit.

49:49.218 --> 49:57.433
And I think in this country, a thesis can be made that the book collector is responsible for the preservation of scholarship, of human thought.

49:57.453 --> 49:59.637
You've got guys like Morgan, who set up the library.

49:59.697 --> 50:00.318
That's right.

50:00.338 --> 50:02.522
You've got guys like Folger, the Shakespeare Library.

50:02.883 --> 50:04.326
Huntington, the Huntington Library.

50:04.386 --> 50:05.748
Newbery, the Newbery Library.

50:06.409 --> 50:08.774
You know, the Scheider Library down at Princeton.

50:09.074 --> 50:09.996
Well, I don't know.

50:10.016 --> 50:10.878
That's a family library.

50:10.898 --> 50:12.100
It's a family library.

50:12.140 --> 50:13.302
He's still alive.

50:13.636 --> 50:14.918
Shady is still alive.

50:15.098 --> 50:17.962
And I'm told that his daughter is now interested in the collection.

50:18.042 --> 50:18.863
Right, right.

50:18.963 --> 50:20.645
Have you ever had any dealings with them?

50:21.046 --> 50:24.430
Yes, I sold them things many, many years ago.

50:24.450 --> 50:25.772
They've got a Gutenberg Bible.

50:26.433 --> 50:26.934
Yes, I have.

50:26.974 --> 50:28.696
One of the very few privately owned.

50:28.776 --> 50:38.709
I had a customer who was the president of Bank for Savings in New York.

50:38.729 --> 50:41.533
His name was DeCorsi Dales, F-A-L-E-S.

50:44.602 --> 50:45.403
He loved books.

50:46.524 --> 50:49.408
There was a man that, he was a banker.

50:49.908 --> 50:51.150
He was president of the bank.

50:53.232 --> 50:59.299
And what I tell you now is not for publication.

50:59.319 --> 51:00.000
I'll shut it off, okay?

51:01.182 --> 51:02.203
I have it on the tape.

51:02.223 --> 51:03.825
May you say that again, please?

51:04.786 --> 51:07.289
I won't use his name, but it's an instance.

51:08.070 --> 51:10.913
It's either you go or the books go.

51:15.314 --> 51:20.861
The world was splitting, you know.

51:20.901 --> 51:21.562
So what happened?

51:22.343 --> 51:29.572
And he came to me, and he said he'd like to put his library somewhere, you know, somewhere.

51:30.934 --> 51:37.062
So I thought for a while, and I tried.

51:38.364 --> 51:41.408
And, you know, nobody wanted to get in the room.

51:41.428 --> 51:43.330
I mean, you know, a library has

51:43.664 --> 51:46.186
How many volumes approximately would you say we're talking about?

51:46.206 --> 51:46.627
Oh, thousands.

51:47.627 --> 51:47.908
Thousands.

51:47.928 --> 51:48.628
Like more than 25,000?

51:48.788 --> 51:49.229
Yeah.

51:49.249 --> 51:54.853
And I finally went to NYU.

51:54.954 --> 51:56.635
I had some friends at NYU.

51:58.857 --> 52:05.402
And I managed to get to the president.

52:07.124 --> 52:13.249
And I went in, had an interview, I had an appointment with him, came with the president.

52:13.567 --> 52:17.332
And I told him my story, like I'm telling it to you.

52:17.352 --> 52:24.102
He was a man that loved books, autographs, and he would like to establish it somewhere.

52:24.122 --> 52:26.846
And the quality was excellent.

52:26.926 --> 52:27.267
Excellent.

52:28.228 --> 52:38.923
And he thought for a while and he said, well, I think we could work it out.

52:38.964 --> 52:42.088
Talk to my man who's in charge of

52:43.267 --> 52:44.549
rooms or some of them.

52:45.029 --> 52:48.453
So they gave us three rooms on 5th Avenue and 8th Street.

52:48.614 --> 52:49.915
NYU did.

52:49.935 --> 52:50.556
NYU.

52:51.517 --> 52:52.759
And we started there.

52:54.361 --> 52:59.888
And then we moved it into the, then we rented a floor on 10th Street, big floor.

53:00.629 --> 53:02.631
And we had a full librarian.

53:03.192 --> 53:03.572
Wow.

53:04.313 --> 53:12.143
We had, and this man had, he gave NYU one of the great

53:12.730 --> 53:18.059
collections of books and autographs, thousands of letters, thousands of letters.

53:18.079 --> 53:19.903
Mainly because his wife gave him an ultimatum.

53:22.868 --> 53:26.875
The other one was... I'm just going to switch this on the other side before you continue.
