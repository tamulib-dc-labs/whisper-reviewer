00:03.946 --> 00:09.993
This is Fred Bass and Nancy Bass.

00:10.013 --> 00:15.841
I don't have an office.

00:18.864 --> 00:24.351
These are all great quotes by the way.

00:24.803 --> 00:26.845
Have you ever had an office?

00:26.865 --> 00:32.552
The office on the main floor that was up there was built for me 25 years ago.

00:32.652 --> 00:34.594
It was built specifically for me.

00:34.795 --> 00:38.539
I spent about two hours in it.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.446
For the first year, I spent about two hours in it, and my bookkeepers just moved in and took it over.

00:44.466 --> 00:48.010
They left me a desk for about six months, and then they took over the desk.

00:48.361 --> 00:52.145
You decided you didn't want to be on the floor?

00:52.686 --> 00:55.429
You have to be or you want to be?

00:55.469 --> 00:57.831
Well, that's where I'm productive.

00:57.851 --> 00:59.093
And do you feel the same way?

01:00.935 --> 01:03.077
She's nodding her head in the affirmative.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.003
So tell me where we are.

01:09.404 --> 01:11.286
And you own this building now, right?

01:11.326 --> 01:15.330
This is where we receive shipments of manures and quantities and stuff.

01:15.631 --> 01:18.995
and do our processing up here and our storage.

01:19.015 --> 01:24.462
And I'm just taking it physically through the warehouse just to show you the storage.

01:24.482 --> 01:27.005
What would you estimate the square footage up here?

01:27.126 --> 01:28.167
10,500.

01:28.187 --> 01:28.447
10,005?

01:28.467 --> 01:34.174
And it's packed.

01:34.194 --> 01:41.984
There's a room there that's filled with stuff and storage.

01:42.004 --> 01:43.326
And there's boxes blocking the aisles.

01:44.352 --> 01:47.636
Now, most of these things are under control.

01:47.656 --> 01:49.619
You can retrieve most of them.

01:49.639 --> 01:52.082
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:52.102 --> 01:53.764
So I see there's more.

01:53.965 --> 02:04.038
I know, but I'm just counting with the red here.

02:04.138 --> 02:10.967
Is this largely review?

02:11.318 --> 02:29.255
Why is so much inventory essential?

02:32.078 --> 02:36.863
I can't answer the question.

02:36.943 --> 02:39.165
That's why you've got to have such a big spread.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.387
of books to keep people around.

02:42.608 --> 02:48.964
And I think that you've got to grab the bargain that you want.

02:49.004 --> 02:49.666
Grab the bargain?

02:51.491 --> 02:55.922
Yeah, but a lot of, you've got an MBA, Nancy.

02:56.223 --> 03:01.257
Is it costing you money to store so much inventory?

03:01.778 --> 03:03.041
It is.

03:03.061 --> 03:10.722
That's why we want to open up another floor and get as much stuff as we can.

03:12.052 --> 03:15.476
because especially the New York rental market.

03:17.178 --> 03:20.401
That was the theory, wasn't it, when you opened up the Fulton Street store?

03:20.461 --> 03:23.104
Fulton Street is 15,000 square feet.

03:23.505 --> 03:27.249
And we figured that at least we can get rid of part of the 10th floor.

03:27.309 --> 03:28.570
This is unbelievable.

03:29.291 --> 03:29.431
Yeah.

03:29.952 --> 03:31.453
I think the books just multiply.

03:31.634 --> 03:33.255
Hold this for me.

03:33.315 --> 03:33.496
Sure.

03:33.516 --> 03:35.838
I'm going to take a few pictures.

03:35.878 --> 03:37.300
Don't worry about it.

03:37.540 --> 03:38.761
I'm just wandering around with you.

03:38.781 --> 03:40.243
The books just multiply at night.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.025
It's really nothing to do with us.

03:43.085 --> 03:45.809
Don't you think?

03:46.350 --> 03:50.496
I don't even want to take you down there because the thing is so... Who does all the buying?

03:51.197 --> 03:54.261
Do you do the buying?

03:55.042 --> 03:59.569
I do most of the buying over the counter when I'm here, but I have backup buyers here, of course.

04:00.110 --> 04:01.993
The remainder of buying is done by a team.

04:02.033 --> 04:10.805
Mostly one of my men, Paul Secord, does it with a backup team from the art department and the review department.

04:10.825 --> 04:12.568
The review does their own buying.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.562
most of the time.

04:13.983 --> 04:18.933
Rare Book Room does their buying, but we buy a lot of rare books on the main floor and send them upstairs.

04:18.953 --> 04:22.179
And you move a lot of stuff, like proofs that come in and galleys.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.203
Yeah, they come from all different departments.

04:24.243 --> 04:26.989
So there's a lot of team buying going on here.

04:27.630 --> 04:30.135
I essentially control the buying in the store yet.

04:30.605 --> 04:34.871
What do you wild-ass estimate guess of what you have in terms of logging?

04:34.911 --> 04:36.333
Two and a half million books plus.

04:37.094 --> 04:37.815
In this location?

04:37.835 --> 04:38.796
In this location.

04:38.816 --> 04:39.036
Wow.

04:39.216 --> 04:44.383
Well, you know, our slogan is eight miles of books, but it's really more like... Twelve and a half miles of books.

04:44.403 --> 04:46.746
Yeah, but it's too hard to change the slogan at this point.

04:46.766 --> 04:48.028
More than most libraries.

04:48.268 --> 04:48.969
Yeah.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.893
But physically, you can see what we have up here.

04:51.913 --> 04:54.497
They're just, you know, the boxes are all under control.

04:54.517 --> 04:56.119
Do you know what's in all of these places?

04:56.780 --> 04:57.100
Yeah.

04:57.220 --> 04:59.363
Up here, pretty much everything's under control.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.570
And the control means that it's cataloged.

05:01.591 --> 05:02.512
It's cataloged.

05:02.592 --> 05:05.377
It's either in the computer or in a record index.

05:06.499 --> 05:15.215
So the boxes are labeled, and they say the price on it, and they say how many books are in the boxes, and when they got it in with the publisher.

05:16.938 --> 05:18.201
I'm having a major check.

05:18.221 --> 05:18.721
Take a shot.

05:18.802 --> 05:21.807
Let's see what gets you a better aisle.

05:22.073 --> 05:24.415
How about the center aisle?

05:24.575 --> 05:25.556
Or do you want boxes?

05:25.816 --> 05:28.459
Where he can kind of like go into debt?

05:28.979 --> 05:31.582
Do you want boxes?

05:31.602 --> 05:39.148
The lights out now.

05:39.168 --> 05:47.376
I love this.

05:47.476 --> 05:48.277
It's better lit.

05:51.399 --> 05:52.080
Oh yeah.

05:52.550 --> 06:16.249
It's always.

06:16.269 --> 06:17.451
I don't know if you're going to get it through there, Chad.

06:17.471 --> 06:17.932
How many employees are?

06:17.952 --> 06:18.152
About 185.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.479
185 employees.

06:34.046 --> 06:38.858
I think that's the fun of at least downstairs.

06:44.913 --> 06:53.945
I think that some of the fun of downstairs is that, you know, it is a little chaotic, like up here in the warehouse, too, where we're getting in all these books all the time.

06:53.965 --> 06:58.391
We're getting in lots, and Fred's pricing them, and we're getting in all the new books.

06:58.411 --> 07:06.142
So it almost, it's such a different feel from any other place because you can, the books get priced right away, and they're out right away.

07:06.262 --> 07:12.150
So it's, and you can see, but you can watch him buying it right from, you know, where you're buying the books from.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.633
Your father says he has a book madness.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.490
Do you have that as well?

07:16.930 --> 07:17.291
Yeah.

07:17.471 --> 07:21.335
We used to see boxes in the aisle.

07:21.515 --> 07:24.579
We used to see the boxes piled in the aisle.

07:24.619 --> 07:28.123
Those are just shipments that came in temporarily.

07:28.203 --> 07:30.846
Wherever I go, I go and visit the bookstores.

07:30.926 --> 07:34.771
I was just in Bucks County, and I visited bookstores there.

07:34.851 --> 07:38.835
And I bought, even buy books all the time from other stores.

07:40.497 --> 07:43.641
You mentioned the last thing you shared in English.

07:45.275 --> 07:46.958
And I go to the flea markets.

07:47.278 --> 07:49.983
When I went out there, I bought a whole lot of books from there, too.

07:50.023 --> 07:52.186
I'm always doing that.

07:52.447 --> 07:56.453
You go to the homes and the people who work for you and their homes look like this.

07:56.473 --> 07:57.495
Oh, exactly like this.

07:57.515 --> 07:59.198
It's amazing.

07:59.238 --> 08:05.308
Pick up one.

08:06.503 --> 08:07.884
What were you saying about that?

08:07.904 --> 08:12.569
Whenever I go to the homes of any of the employees or the managers, they look exactly like the Strand.

08:12.609 --> 08:16.532
There's books piled up on the floors and on the shelves everywhere.

08:16.572 --> 08:18.634
It's a little bit disorganized.

08:19.195 --> 08:22.898
And there's very little room for furniture and for living.

08:22.938 --> 08:23.599
It's all books.

08:24.419 --> 08:25.641
Does that mean that you attract?

08:25.701 --> 08:26.081
Yes.

08:26.261 --> 08:31.826
Oh, wait, there's a little more I want to show them here yet.

08:31.926 --> 08:34.789
The type of employees love books, and they

08:35.258 --> 08:39.284
They loved collecting things, and they loved old books, especially.

08:39.324 --> 08:41.948
And that's across the board.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.770
I'm so surprised, every single one of them.

08:45.553 --> 08:48.036
This used to be our old rare book department.

08:48.597 --> 08:54.526
Yeah, so now the three rooms are also filled up with remainders and processing of things we're doing and stuff.

08:54.546 --> 08:57.570
You know, stuff I can't resist.

08:57.989 --> 09:00.753
They're full leather and half leather books.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.176
They might have those for the next 10 to 15 years.

09:03.196 --> 09:07.442
So I bought them for a long time because I get constant calls from these things.

09:07.462 --> 09:09.905
And they're all classic titles that we'll never go out of.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.908
For instance, why don't you just read a couple off Nancy?

09:11.968 --> 09:15.113
I see the background by Dr. Daphne de Maurier.

09:15.133 --> 09:18.597
The Iliad, The Odyssey, Copperfield.

09:18.657 --> 09:22.022
Mary Shelley has heard that the price, look at the price.

09:23.572 --> 09:25.534
Wow, $5.95, that's the strand place.

09:25.554 --> 09:28.538
And does it move pretty well?

09:28.558 --> 09:30.080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:30.180 --> 09:31.081
At that price it does.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.265
And that's nicely illustrated in a box.

09:35.426 --> 09:36.627
And the same with the Franklins.

09:36.688 --> 09:39.691
The Franklins are half leather, books are $15.

09:39.751 --> 09:53.207
And to think that you go into a regular bookstore and you pay like $25 for just any kind of a hardbound book that says nothing, you can get classic leather books for $15 here.

09:55.567 --> 09:59.070
Excuse me.

09:59.831 --> 10:02.533
This is really the heart of the business up here.

10:02.553 --> 10:04.675
Well, I don't want to say that.

10:04.855 --> 10:08.618
Would you say that, that this is the heart of the business?

10:08.638 --> 10:10.320
I think it's downstairs with the used, yeah.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.002
But it's a combination.

10:13.042 --> 10:16.005
Yeah, it's a part of the team.

10:16.105 --> 10:21.249
Do you have an idea of how many people on average walk in?

10:21.349 --> 10:24.352
I don't even want to know.

10:24.452 --> 10:25.573
All right.

10:26.228 --> 10:31.705
Yeah, yeah.

10:32.226 --> 10:40.491
That's really great.

10:42.479 --> 10:46.024
Now, when you were going to the University of Wisconsin, did you plan to come into that?

10:46.044 --> 10:46.885
Yeah, I always did.

10:46.926 --> 10:47.146
Did you?

10:47.446 --> 10:48.268
I always wanted to, yeah.

10:48.288 --> 10:48.828
Do you have any siblings?

10:48.848 --> 10:50.050
Because I think, yeah, I do.

10:50.070 --> 10:54.196
I have an older brother who's not interested.

10:54.256 --> 11:02.168
But I think that the reason why I wanted to is because I know how much my father loves it, so that was always reflected, and I thought this would be the greatest thing to do.

11:02.589 --> 11:04.131
I mean, I tried other things.

11:04.191 --> 11:05.753
I worked for Esson for a while.

11:05.813 --> 11:07.135
I mean, I did a lot of small.

11:07.195 --> 11:10.360
I worked as an intern and worked in an advertising company.

11:10.576 --> 11:13.120
For Exxon, I was a business consultant.

11:13.280 --> 11:19.068
I had a sales and territory service station, and I kind of was in between with Exxon.

11:19.088 --> 11:19.929
I really enjoyed it.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.313
I really liked the gasoline station owners.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.956
So you actually did try other things before coming in here?

11:24.976 --> 11:25.077
Yeah.

11:25.157 --> 11:26.719
Or was this for experience?

11:26.739 --> 11:29.343
For experience to do this.

11:29.363 --> 11:31.606
And you're a partner with your father now, is that right?

11:31.666 --> 11:32.988
Do you have a formal title?

11:33.268 --> 11:34.149
Do you have titles here?

11:34.169 --> 11:35.952
Well, I'm a part owner, too.

11:36.393 --> 11:40.178
I mean, he's got the majority, but he should.

11:40.613 --> 11:48.111
Well, would you say that you were motivated to come into this business as much because it is a tradition?

11:48.171 --> 11:58.335
If you weren't here to assume the mantle that it would be the disappearance of an institution?

11:59.378 --> 12:04.105
I don't think so.

12:04.125 --> 12:12.637
I mean, it really depends on who bought it, so I'm having a hard time kind of projecting it, but I would think definitely if a corporation bought it, it definitely would not be the same.

12:12.697 --> 12:17.925
It would be, well, Barnes & Noble's opened up that annex, that used book annex, and that failed miserably.

12:17.965 --> 12:19.247
They lost lots and lots of money.

12:19.267 --> 12:22.972
I'm sorry.

12:23.353 --> 12:27.158
Hi.

12:27.644 --> 12:35.829
Do you want us to go around, or can you unblock that a little bit?

12:35.849 --> 12:36.872
Oh, OK.

12:36.953 --> 12:40.945
OK, thanks.

12:41.085 --> 12:41.687
Yeah.

12:42.342 --> 12:42.903
I don't know.

12:42.923 --> 12:52.153
I think it's always, you know, you always lose something, too, if somebody doesn't have an interest in a business, where it's not personal, where they're not here all the time, because my father and I are here almost all the time.

12:52.453 --> 12:55.597
So there's always a, there's basically a boss here.

12:55.897 --> 12:56.357
Yeah.

12:56.698 --> 12:58.300
I think that's important to you.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.142
I think it is, yeah.

13:00.302 --> 13:04.667
I mean, it's really hard work, too, with the amount of time that you spend here.

13:04.707 --> 13:08.771
I mean, but it's not such hard work if you really love it, though.

13:08.791 --> 13:10.493
You know, some of them don't want you to,

13:10.827 --> 13:13.274
I don't touch it.

13:13.355 --> 13:14.458
I want you to remember that.

13:14.478 --> 13:15.762
It's something you want to talk about.

13:17.307 --> 13:19.774
You introduced this book rental.

13:20.159 --> 13:22.483
I'm interested in talking about that.

13:22.503 --> 13:26.889
I'm going to have a chapter in this talk about institutional libraries and how books still matter.

13:26.969 --> 13:34.100
Believe it or not, in this technological paradigm shift that they're going on.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.824
Are you noticing a slowdown in acquisitions from colleges?

13:36.904 --> 13:37.906
No, no.

13:37.926 --> 13:45.998
No, our library business is still very healthy, and they're very active.

13:46.298 --> 13:48.081
And they come to us mainly because of price.

13:48.723 --> 13:50.346
They save a lot of money.

13:50.366 --> 13:53.873
We have the books, but the price is very important to a lot of them.

13:53.893 --> 13:58.041
They're spending so much money on technology, they've got to save some money on it.

13:58.061 --> 13:58.702
Watch your staff.

13:58.722 --> 13:59.544
It's a little hot.

14:00.145 --> 14:03.712
Is this a traditional area?

14:03.752 --> 14:04.213
What's that?

14:04.273 --> 14:07.720
Is this something you just noticed?

14:07.740 --> 14:08.982
The library is traveling.

14:09.451 --> 14:11.856
And we're talking academic libraries.

14:11.876 --> 14:13.318
Academic libraries and public libraries.

14:13.519 --> 14:19.190
Would you have a ballpark guess of how many libraries you do business with on a regular basis?

14:19.791 --> 14:20.332
Thousands.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.776
Thousands?

14:22.937 --> 14:23.658
All over the world.

14:24.079 --> 14:27.325
Hundreds are actors.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.568
but occasionally thousands, yeah.

14:29.588 --> 14:30.269
So what happens?

14:30.289 --> 14:35.277
Do you think that they send you a list of newly published books and try and have you fill them?

14:35.397 --> 14:35.878
Oh, I'll explain.

14:35.898 --> 14:36.860
We'll explain later on.

14:37.160 --> 14:44.411
I just want to show you the madness of this operation, because most of these, not all of them, are new libraries that we acquired.

14:44.431 --> 14:48.638
These are private-type libraries or individual libraries?

14:51.233 --> 14:54.460
Maybe your questions are... 10th floor.

15:01.776 --> 15:11.217
These are part of the Hilton Head.

15:11.483 --> 15:12.925
We pick more.

15:12.945 --> 15:13.847
We send the annex.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.652
We send some of them as we can.

15:16.672 --> 15:19.897
Do you want to put, like, annex instead of a label?

15:19.977 --> 15:20.438
Oh, yeah.

15:20.518 --> 15:22.542
We just have to mark these off.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.505
Mary Shelley Frankenstein books.

15:24.605 --> 15:25.967
Are you showing me downstairs?

15:25.987 --> 15:27.510
Yeah, extra storage for them.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.335
Yeah, but how many did you buy?

15:30.355 --> 15:31.577
Yeah, that's whole block.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.622
I couldn't say none for that.

15:38.264 --> 15:42.308
Most of these things here are collections of books they've bought, but I haven't gotten to yet.

15:42.989 --> 15:45.152
So there are estates and things that you've got?

15:45.552 --> 15:49.596
Libraries that Marvin has bought, or I've bought, and they're in storage up there.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.199
So there's a very good possibility that there's some rare books in here.

15:52.219 --> 15:52.840
Oh, there's a lot.

15:53.080 --> 16:01.229
There's a whole... I would say there's at least 2,000 boxes for the rare book department to process.

16:01.249 --> 16:02.491
That they're here.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.732
That they'll never get to.

16:04.066 --> 16:04.807
Don't say that.

16:05.168 --> 16:05.909
You don't know what's in there.

16:05.929 --> 16:07.711
Well, we'll let Marvin retire until he does them.

16:07.731 --> 16:11.677
He doesn't do them anymore, so he's just terrible.

16:11.877 --> 16:15.482
Up here are still... Lonnie?

16:16.123 --> 16:16.623
Is this open?

16:18.106 --> 16:23.493
How old is this building?

16:23.914 --> 16:24.234
1901.

16:24.254 --> 16:25.075
1901.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.117
What was it originally?

16:26.137 --> 16:26.898
An office building?

16:27.298 --> 16:28.099
Manufacturing.

16:28.120 --> 16:28.901
Manufacturing.

16:29.521 --> 16:29.922
Bill?

16:30.509 --> 16:36.615
We officially describe ourselves as being in the East Village, is that right?

16:37.155 --> 16:38.897
Well, that's the village.

16:39.697 --> 16:40.858
I'm not going to drag you through.

16:40.878 --> 16:42.160
There's three rooms back there.

16:42.180 --> 16:45.663
There's two big rooms back there and all this whole stuff.

16:45.783 --> 16:48.645
The 10th floor is just filled with boxes.

16:48.946 --> 16:51.248
I took it over temporarily about four years ago.

16:51.588 --> 16:54.971
Just a little spot up there I took from the landlord before I bought the building.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.573
Little by little I filled it.

16:56.593 --> 16:59.335
So where did you keep this stuff before you acquired the building?

16:59.534 --> 17:01.877
I just keep multiplying.

17:02.378 --> 17:03.700
But everything is on site, though.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.462
You don't have any other warehouses?

17:06.243 --> 17:06.323
No.

17:06.343 --> 17:07.545
No, I've got 81.

17:09.407 --> 17:09.688
What's wrong?

17:09.708 --> 17:11.450
Oh, they're working on it.

17:11.770 --> 17:13.513
Do we have maps this way?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.035
Um, we can show them that.

17:15.055 --> 17:16.156
Do you have maps?

17:16.176 --> 17:16.477
Mm-hmm.

17:16.497 --> 17:17.919
All right, we'll go down the street.

17:17.939 --> 17:20.883
You don't see them up there, I think.

17:20.903 --> 17:21.123
Nice, nice.

17:21.143 --> 17:21.784
Need the idea.

17:22.044 --> 17:24.247
Uh, this is celebrating, though.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.268
We're working on it.

17:26.029 --> 17:26.230
What?

17:26.610 --> 17:27.972
I think it's not based on the payment.

17:28.323 --> 17:29.525
Oh, okay.

17:29.545 --> 17:35.514
All right, let's go down to the back.

17:35.534 --> 17:43.546
There was a piece in Fortune magazine, and I can't say I read the whole thing, but it was about some guy who moved from here doing that piece.

17:43.566 --> 17:44.848
Yeah, it was with Capitol.

17:45.068 --> 17:45.729
Yeah.

17:45.749 --> 17:46.170
Yeah.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.937
He's in this book.

17:50.957 --> 17:51.598
Well, it's right.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.962
The boxes go way back there, too.

17:54.302 --> 17:55.444
You want to see it?

18:00.537 --> 18:03.720
This isn't Doyle up here, huh?

18:03.740 --> 18:06.463
No, that's not Doyle.

18:06.843 --> 18:07.184
Is that a cutter?

18:07.204 --> 18:08.565
No, this is.

18:08.605 --> 18:16.493
You've actually gone through this.

18:16.513 --> 18:16.913
Unbelievable.

18:16.933 --> 18:19.295
I've never seen anything like this.

18:19.376 --> 18:22.419
I've seen places filled with books, but I've never seen places filled with boxes.

18:22.919 --> 18:26.983
These are things we've got to get through.

18:28.364 --> 18:29.085
I'm sorry, what?

18:29.105 --> 18:31.088
We bought a library of 20,000 books.

18:31.389 --> 18:33.031
From a customer of mine from way back.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.014
All handpicked by him.

18:35.294 --> 18:37.738
Probably many of them bought here.

18:37.958 --> 18:51.358
I don't know where he's going to put it, but... Lonnie, Lonnie, this is Nicholas Basman's book.

18:51.559 --> 18:53.241
That book is really famous.

18:53.795 --> 18:55.237
Did you do tours and things?

18:55.297 --> 18:55.437
Yeah.

18:55.998 --> 18:56.218
Wow.

18:56.299 --> 18:56.939
I'm still doing stuff.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.722
I'm giving the keynote address at the A.B.

18:58.742 --> 19:01.806
Bookman's weekly thing out in Colorado Springs.

19:01.826 --> 19:02.247
Wow.

19:03.028 --> 19:04.110
Did you do TV, too?

19:04.510 --> 19:06.794
I was on, you know, the Brian Lamb book, Book Notes?

19:06.854 --> 19:07.154
Sure.

19:07.414 --> 19:07.895
I'm in there.

19:08.316 --> 19:08.556
Wow.

19:08.676 --> 19:09.858
My interviewer's in there.

19:09.878 --> 19:12.882
He picked my interviewer and put me in Storytellers, which is very nice.

19:14.024 --> 19:21.895
Oh, if we, uh, the, uh, Poulter's going to bring out the owl edition, finally, of my book in March.

19:22.550 --> 19:23.252
Yeah?

19:23.272 --> 19:23.733
Oh, that's great.

19:23.753 --> 19:24.394
With a new preface.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.780
I'm going to write a 4,000-word update.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.863
Of disease?

19:27.883 --> 19:29.907
Just, you know, things that have happened in three years.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.995
Bloomberg is out of jail and back in jail again.

19:33.075 --> 19:34.378
Carter Burden died.

19:34.398 --> 19:36.343
You know, his library went to the Morgan.

19:37.425 --> 19:38.989
Chef Louis died.

19:39.509 --> 19:43.614
Haskell Norman not only died, but his library is one of the biggest sales at auction of the life.

19:43.634 --> 19:44.915
So that kind of stuff.

19:45.676 --> 19:51.042
And Aaron Lansky, the Yiddish Book Center, finally opened in Hampshire.

19:51.062 --> 19:52.964
So there's some nice, cute things.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.047
And it proves the essential theme of the book is the cycle of books.

19:56.568 --> 20:00.653
You just mentioned 20,000 books that you bought that are coming back here.

20:00.673 --> 20:02.354
Probably 10,000 of them came here.

20:02.895 --> 20:05.618
Originally, the guy was a customer of mine 30 years ago.

20:06.155 --> 20:13.786
He disappeared on me for the last 10 years, but he moved up to Connecticut, and suddenly he's had to move, and he didn't want to move the book.

20:13.826 --> 20:16.710
So did these 20,000 books come out of an apartment?

20:16.990 --> 20:17.571
No, it's a house.

20:18.031 --> 20:18.692
Out of a house.

20:18.793 --> 20:18.913
Wow.

20:18.933 --> 20:19.774
Which is really great.

20:19.814 --> 20:21.676
It's all this recycling, you know, the books.

20:21.697 --> 20:31.009
They just keep coming back, and people can read them, and then they can... I know the picture you have is a little terrific, but this is kind of cool, too.

20:31.049 --> 20:32.992
Let's give me another one.

20:33.012 --> 20:33.192
Okay.

20:33.212 --> 20:33.613
That's great.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.020
Excellent.

20:36.040 --> 20:36.240
Thank you.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.242
I like it.

20:38.282 --> 20:40.024
I use my own pictures in my books, too.

20:40.044 --> 20:46.951
You know, you were asking me about, you know, I don't know if you've been to a lot of employees' homes, but it's exactly like the store, where it's books everywhere, and I was saying that.

20:47.251 --> 20:51.295
Now, my home, on the other hand, is just the opposite of the store.

20:51.315 --> 20:51.815
Why is that?

20:52.316 --> 20:54.598
I have, um, I bring books home all the time.

20:54.898 --> 20:57.681
I read them, and then I return them right away to the store.

21:01.004 --> 21:04.107
Because I want, I want people, it's a good book, I want people to read it.

21:04.660 --> 21:14.211
When did you start working with your father?

21:14.231 --> 21:15.573
I was about 13 years old.

21:15.593 --> 21:16.954
I used to come down and sleep.

21:18.036 --> 21:19.658
So you've always been in the business?

21:19.678 --> 21:20.699
Were you like your daughter?

21:20.719 --> 21:21.680
Did you go after school?

21:22.521 --> 21:24.243
No, I worked after school.

21:24.263 --> 21:30.330
The only time I tried to... Well, I had a few other jobs, you know, small jobs after school.

21:30.496 --> 21:37.024
like a runner for Joey Gold Theatre Ticket Service, which I made a lot of money at as a kid.

21:37.184 --> 21:42.370
Has he seen the office?

21:42.811 --> 21:43.472
Huh?

21:48.478 --> 21:52.283
Has he seen the third floor or the office?

21:52.463 --> 21:54.786
He knows the third floor.

21:54.906 --> 21:59.271
He goes up the real book room all the time, so he knows that part of the operation.

21:59.656 --> 22:05.945
They told my wife and daughters if they get lost today to Carl Craig.

22:06.025 --> 22:17.602
He'll know where you are.

22:17.702 --> 22:22.109
He goes down on a conveyor belt.

22:22.289 --> 22:22.810
Shrink wrap.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.592
Shipping.

22:24.652 --> 22:26.054
This is not for here.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.858
Is this for here?

22:28.878 --> 22:29.219
Yeah, it's here.

22:29.239 --> 22:29.359
Sorry?

22:30.031 --> 22:47.059
Okay.

22:48.061 --> 22:49.764
That's Marvin's office right there.

22:49.784 --> 22:51.887
And this is the clinical department.

22:54.196 --> 23:00.262
which will soon practically disappear.

23:00.842 --> 23:13.694
So, we're now in the... This is the computer room, and this is where we do our desktop publishing.

23:13.714 --> 23:19.800
We're going to just leave that there, don't worry about it.

23:19.820 --> 23:22.903
And we'll go on a... You don't mind if it's...

23:23.744 --> 23:34.959
Episodic, I mean, if we went around.

23:37.422 --> 23:38.463
Whatever you like.

23:38.704 --> 23:41.728
Tell me a little bit, if you can give me a little chronology.

23:41.748 --> 23:42.769
When did your father start the business?

23:42.789 --> 23:43.190
It started in 1927.

23:43.210 --> 23:45.092
You're going to have all that in the papers for yourself.

23:45.112 --> 23:45.973
So you're going to have a background there.

23:45.993 --> 23:49.538
I started working for them after school when I was 13, 14 years old.

23:49.558 --> 23:52.542
And I continued until I got out of college.

23:52.562 --> 23:53.363
Then I went into the Army for two years.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.273
Where'd you go to college?

23:56.553 --> 24:00.498
I went to Brooklyn College.

24:00.518 --> 24:01.139
Sorry?

24:01.159 --> 24:01.880
Were you planning?

24:01.900 --> 24:07.307
I mean, did you always know that you'd be coming into this business?

24:07.427 --> 24:08.528
No, no, I didn't.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.192
I know I liked it, but I didn't know I would be here.

24:11.212 --> 24:12.534
Where was your dad located?

24:12.554 --> 24:14.896
Well, we were starving when I was going to school.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.360
And, you know, it was a very tough city.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.561
Was your father one of these 4th Avenue booksellers?

24:18.581 --> 24:20.003
Originally, the store was on 4th Avenue.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.645
The original store was on Astro Place.

24:22.098 --> 24:30.647
And then we moved to 4th Avenue.

24:30.907 --> 24:40.797
And for a period until about 25, no, I'm told about 40 some odd years ago, we were on 4th Avenue and we lost our lease.

24:40.817 --> 24:43.159
And we were one of the first stores to move off 4th Avenue.

24:43.179 --> 24:43.700
You were one of the first?

24:43.720 --> 24:44.080
First stores.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.722
How many were left at that?

24:45.742 --> 24:46.843
There were about 48 stores on 4th Avenue.

24:46.863 --> 24:47.143
At a time.

24:47.444 --> 24:54.193
28 stores and warehouses and offices that, you know, booksellers that operated out of office.

24:54.213 --> 24:59.460
And the gentleman who handles rare books for you, Marvin Mondland, has been working on a history.

24:59.480 --> 25:00.682
He was working on 4th Avenue.

25:00.702 --> 25:06.189
He also, for as long as I've known him, has been working on a history.

25:06.349 --> 25:11.857
And at some point I'm going to talk to Marvin about that, because I'd love that you can get some quotes about the tradition from which you emerged.

25:11.897 --> 25:12.437
What happened?

25:12.518 --> 25:13.799
What happened?

25:13.919 --> 25:14.941
What happened for 4th Avenue?

25:15.021 --> 25:15.702
Yeah, what happened?

25:15.782 --> 25:15.882
Okay.

25:17.127 --> 25:35.654
The standard reason, Fourth Avenue, the standard accepted reason that Fourth Avenue disappeared by everybody is that the rents went up and were too high for the youth book business.

25:35.674 --> 25:36.556
I've been challenging that right along.

25:36.576 --> 25:43.646
I said the real reason Fourth Avenue disappeared was that the 48, some of the 40-some-odd booksellers there were all very strong, self-centered individuals who kept all their knowledge to themselves.

25:43.666 --> 25:44.367
They didn't teach anybody.

25:45.545 --> 25:52.736
and only two sons of booksellers went into the business.

25:53.057 --> 25:55.541
That was Donald Weiser, W-E-I-S-C-R.

25:55.561 --> 25:56.542
What was the name of that?

25:56.622 --> 25:59.367
It was Weiser's bookstore.

25:59.467 --> 26:03.553
Donald went into it, and now he's an occult book publisher out of Maine.

26:04.124 --> 26:11.917
So he no longer has a retail store.

26:12.157 --> 26:17.105
Yeah, in fact, his retail store closed about five years ago.

26:17.125 --> 26:20.431
And his retail store in Fort Abdon didn't specialize in a cult, too?

26:20.832 --> 26:22.554
Well, he was specialized in a cult, but he was a second-hand bookseller.

26:23.396 --> 26:24.978
He actually had a good gimmick that you enjoyed.

26:25.219 --> 26:27.923
He put the books out on tables, and he had a succession of about 10-12 tables.

26:27.943 --> 26:30.267
And every day, practically every day, the books would be moved to the back.

26:30.955 --> 26:40.085
as fresh stuff came in, and the books in the back would be marked down and put up front until they were down to practically 35 cents each.

26:40.105 --> 26:40.606
Very interesting.

26:40.626 --> 26:42.868
But that was the way they operated, continuous rotation.

26:42.888 --> 26:50.957
You mentioned that, was this endemic to the species, that they kept all the information to themselves?

26:50.978 --> 26:53.460
It was just, they were strong individuals, including my dad.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.241
Were they largely Jewish?

26:54.401 --> 26:55.162
Yeah, mostly Jewish.

26:55.182 --> 26:55.883
And was this

26:56.521 --> 27:09.173
a trade that they learned from many of the immigrants?

27:09.193 --> 27:10.554
Did they come here with this still?

27:10.574 --> 27:12.135
No, I think a lot of them were American-born.

27:12.155 --> 27:19.242
You only have a chapter in this book on the Jewish booksellers, by the way.

27:19.262 --> 27:22.945
Look, I think Martin will give you more information on their religion, but I can't remember the background.

27:22.965 --> 27:24.106
Yeah, they all came out with Depression people.

27:24.126 --> 27:24.887
I mean, Argusy used to be on the book.

27:24.907 --> 27:25.628
I didn't know that.

27:25.648 --> 27:25.988
Way, way back.

27:27.318 --> 27:42.682
But we were the first, one of the first ones to leave for it that year, and we moved over to Broadway.

27:42.702 --> 27:47.109
And this is what's going to be interesting for you.

27:47.129 --> 27:51.636
And one of the reasons we were successful on Broadway, which was not a book tour, which was off the beaten track of Hook Park, it was more street track.

27:51.656 --> 27:52.718
We got off a dead street onto an active street.

27:54.200 --> 28:00.287
Do you think if you hadn't moved from 4th Avenue to here that you'd still be in business?

28:00.367 --> 28:01.809
Do you think you wouldn't?

28:01.829 --> 28:03.470
Well, it'd still be in business.

28:04.071 --> 28:06.694
I don't think it would be successful.

28:07.575 --> 28:12.681
It wouldn't be the business that it is today.

28:12.701 --> 28:13.522
Yeah, it wouldn't be what it is.

28:13.542 --> 28:15.484
But it was just, there was so much more traffic and more people.

28:15.584 --> 28:17.306
To go back, everybody talks about it.

28:17.326 --> 28:17.526
It's true.

28:17.546 --> 28:18.407
I mean, I'm there to echo.

28:18.427 --> 28:19.429
I want to backtrack.

28:19.449 --> 28:19.969
We left out the park.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.452
There were strong individuals that didn't impart anything.

28:22.772 --> 28:23.413
They all got old.

28:24.355 --> 28:36.954
and fade it away.

28:36.974 --> 28:37.775
They couldn't face the doubling of rice.

28:37.795 --> 28:38.656
They couldn't face the increase in expense.

28:38.676 --> 28:39.938
You know, they were too old and tired, so they just faded away.

28:39.958 --> 28:40.539
Can you think of a few names?

28:40.559 --> 28:41.200
No, there was Stammer, there was

28:41.534 --> 28:59.521
But I mean, you're right, if the rents were increased, then they would find another part of town to move into and make that a bookman.

28:59.541 --> 29:02.885
We went from 4th Avenue, where we were paying $110 a month rent.

29:03.066 --> 29:07.893
And it had just been increased, so, you know, $110 to Broadway and 12th, where our rent was $400.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.736
Everybody thought we were crazy.

29:09.756 --> 29:10.056
We were scared.

29:10.627 --> 29:20.000
Before I bought the building, my landlord was getting a check for me every month for $55,000.

29:20.020 --> 29:23.686
So I went from $110 a month to $55,000.

29:23.766 --> 29:26.510
I bought it in about a year and a half.

29:26.530 --> 29:30.756
And I understand you're planning actually to redesign.

29:30.916 --> 29:36.624
We have designs to take over another floor, a second floor, and open up the retail space.

29:36.644 --> 29:39.408
So we would have four floors of retail?

29:39.909 --> 29:40.009
Yeah.

29:40.529 --> 29:47.503
Are you going to change the nature of the business?

29:47.523 --> 29:57.865
Just expand all the sections that we have, make it a little more user-friendly, and get more hard books on this planet.

29:57.885 --> 29:58.987
We've got stores on the 10th floor and the 5th floor.

29:59.007 --> 29:59.989
How would you describe this bookstore?

30:00.009 --> 30:00.650
Is it a second-hand bookstore?

30:00.670 --> 30:01.913
Essentially, it's a second-hand bookstore.

30:01.893 --> 30:19.984
Tell me about that.

30:20.004 --> 30:20.926
You basically initiated that here, didn't you?

30:20.946 --> 30:22.769
And I've read in various stories that this is a teaser.

30:22.789 --> 30:23.631
Is this something that you make money on?

30:23.651 --> 30:24.913
Well, we have to make money on it because the volume is so big.

30:25.096 --> 30:27.858
But we don't make a lot of money.

30:27.879 --> 30:31.382
What amazes me is that you buy everything.

30:31.462 --> 30:34.444
The problem is we have to buy everything, and we get stuck with a tremendous amount of material.

30:34.464 --> 30:36.466
That just doesn't even sell to half price.

30:36.486 --> 30:41.771
But that's quite a compact you make with these customers.

30:41.851 --> 30:45.554
That's the only way I can get the books.

30:45.735 --> 30:48.377
We buy them all across the books.

30:48.397 --> 30:52.681
The only time we won't do that is when we find out that there are lots of new things.

30:52.761 --> 30:54.262
And I think that's essential.

30:54.282 --> 30:55.103
It's a good thing.

30:55.252 --> 31:11.330
Do you sell a lot of these reviewers' books to institutional libraries?

31:12.411 --> 31:14.693
Yes.

31:14.713 --> 31:20.239
As a rough estimate, how many reviewers would you say?

31:20.260 --> 31:20.440
Hundreds.

31:20.460 --> 31:20.640
Hundreds.

31:20.660 --> 31:21.161
And all over the country.

31:21.181 --> 31:21.961
It took us many, many years to do this.

31:21.981 --> 31:22.542
And of course, one, I think,

31:22.977 --> 31:38.823
You maintain confidential... Absolutely confidential with all people we deal with.

31:38.843 --> 31:44.111
And how long has... I don't want the world to know who I'm dealing with because I don't want competition on that.

31:44.131 --> 31:46.375
And you basically have Claire Fields in New York doing this, wouldn't you say?

31:47.016 --> 31:48.799
More or less, yeah.

31:49.218 --> 32:07.442
I'm sorry to be jumping around here.

32:07.463 --> 32:09.085
I would like to get a little more detail on the institutional stuff that you did.

32:09.105 --> 32:10.086
We have a lot of librarians coming into business.

32:10.106 --> 32:11.127
They're trips to New York, but they're in New York.

32:11.147 --> 32:11.969
They come back and they select the books.

32:11.989 --> 32:12.289
That's one way.

32:12.309 --> 32:12.970
We do a lot through our catalogs.

32:12.990 --> 32:13.711
We produce lists from the libraries.

32:13.731 --> 32:15.293
And then many libraries just order from us a place where we go blanket orders.

32:16.015 --> 32:34.839
any books that they're ordering before they order them from the publisher or the distributor.

32:34.859 --> 32:37.642
I did an interview with a woman who just opened a new university library in Florida.

32:37.662 --> 32:38.283
It's not even a year old.

32:39.545 --> 32:39.885
It's a year old.

32:39.905 --> 32:40.086
Next one.

32:40.106 --> 32:41.768
She's the one who got the books from Uppsala out in New Jersey, $450,000.

32:41.788 --> 32:42.989
She was a steal.

32:43.009 --> 32:43.710
She left the whole college library.

32:43.730 --> 32:45.212
But she said to buy a new academic book, the average price is $51 a book.

32:46.188 --> 32:56.702
The published price is probably up there, yeah.

32:56.722 --> 33:00.086
And so she was trying to explain what a great deal it was.

33:00.106 --> 33:07.857
Now, assuming that to be the case, the institutions that do business with you are getting a pretty good deal, right?

33:07.877 --> 33:08.177
Oh, absolutely.

33:08.197 --> 33:08.758
The ones that do it, yeah.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.859
But the librarians are too lazy to do it.

33:09.879 --> 33:10.240
That's what it is.

33:10.260 --> 33:10.840
Oh, they have a fixed budget.

33:10.860 --> 33:12.483
Well, if they have a fixed budget, they need to come to us.

33:12.503 --> 33:14.305
So you would say you do business with hundreds of librarians all over the country?

33:15.517 --> 33:30.083
Ivy League schools, would you say?

33:30.103 --> 33:30.945
Some Ivy League schools, some in the film.

33:30.965 --> 33:31.906
Are you at liberty to name any of these?

33:31.926 --> 33:32.167
That's fine.

33:32.187 --> 33:34.030
My feelings aren't direct, but any question in your own hands, don't blame me for asking me.

33:34.050 --> 33:34.852
Well, our customer list is confidential.

33:34.872 --> 33:35.112
That's fine.

33:35.092 --> 33:47.337
But with all this talk about paradigm shifts away from print culture to electronic culture, you personally have not seen a reduction?

33:47.357 --> 33:49.181
Our sales have gone up continuously throughout this whole time.

33:49.201 --> 33:52.989
And our sales have gone up with the Barnes & Noble's competition there, too.

33:53.009 --> 33:55.935
Barnes & Noble has a superstore five blocks north of me, on Union Square North.

33:56.152 --> 34:03.142
Four-story, dealing with second-hand books?

34:03.162 --> 34:06.867
No, new books, singles.

34:07.167 --> 34:09.090
But I mean, they draw customers, and then they've got another superstore, five blocks more.

34:09.110 --> 34:11.634
And then their main store is still at 18th and 6th.

34:11.654 --> 34:13.176
18th and 10th, which is five blocks, six blocks a year.

34:13.196 --> 34:14.818
So I get surrounded by them, and I say, as I continue, I say, go ahead.

34:15.794 --> 34:29.303
You don't do the kinds of things that, you know, Powell's is it, or the tattered cover, I mean, they're nice, they have readings, and they have authors.

34:29.364 --> 34:30.045
You don't have to do that, do you?

34:30.065 --> 34:31.949
We don't have the space of the time, really.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.432
But would you do it if you have the space?

34:33.452 --> 34:34.174
We've done a couple of them.

34:34.154 --> 34:56.025
We find that they're good time consuming.

34:56.045 --> 34:57.347
And then they interfere with our customers coming into the store.

34:57.367 --> 34:58.449
So I think that we're just really focused on the book.

34:58.469 --> 34:59.571
And forget about the fixtures and everything like that.

34:59.591 --> 35:00.051
That's our coffee bars.

35:00.071 --> 35:00.612
That's our thing, is books.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.855
The best prices, the best quality of books, the getting the volume in, trying to help customers, and that's it.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.077
I will probably use this quote certainly in the bibliopiece.

35:04.495 --> 35:17.791
Because I've already written a lot of Berto Leibold.

35:17.812 --> 35:18.372
I've read the Leibold piece.

35:18.392 --> 35:18.973
Oh, sorry.

35:18.993 --> 35:21.556
That won't be another book.

35:21.576 --> 35:22.698
He said, my wife and I visited him in Milan in November.

35:22.718 --> 35:23.679
He said, this is his favorite place in New York.

35:23.699 --> 35:23.919
Oh, yeah.

35:23.939 --> 35:24.560
He comes in there all the time.

35:24.580 --> 35:24.740
Barnard.

35:24.760 --> 35:25.541
How does that happen?

35:25.561 --> 35:26.502
How does it happen that you have people?

35:26.522 --> 35:27.904
And he's just... Sometimes he finds such a variety of material there.

35:28.289 --> 35:32.992
That's what it is.

35:33.012 --> 35:33.454
And it's always fresh.

35:33.474 --> 35:34.057
There's always something new.

35:34.077 --> 35:35.142
So you can walk in here and see different things.

35:35.162 --> 35:35.785
You indicated that to that?

35:36.524 --> 35:56.263
One of his books is probably the biggest bestseller we've ever had, which is Shadows of Hyper-Reality.

35:56.283 --> 35:56.724
He told me about that.

35:56.744 --> 35:57.244
Absolutely incredible.

35:57.264 --> 35:58.786
Yeah, because I talked to him about some of the themes that he writes about.

35:58.806 --> 35:59.587
And that book was written in the 1970s.

35:59.607 --> 36:00.587
He's anticipating everything that's going on now.

36:00.608 --> 36:03.210
And he said to me, that is the biggest surprise of my life, bigger than Name of the Rose, bigger than anyone else.

36:03.230 --> 36:04.331
He said, because we just put together some pieces.

36:04.351 --> 36:05.232
And he said, that book,

36:05.498 --> 36:09.024
I heard a story about the book.

36:09.044 --> 36:10.366
I'd love to hear it.

36:10.466 --> 36:14.712
Okay, it was Hartford Grace.

36:15.594 --> 36:22.665
Hartford Grace had their hardback on a light sale at $3.95.

36:25.369 --> 36:28.674
So we bought a hundred.

36:28.694 --> 36:32.400
And we put them on display and started selling right away, so I bought another two hundred.

36:32.870 --> 36:40.098
and it started selling right away, so I bought another 500, and it kept selling.

36:40.599 --> 36:47.186
Then I ended up buying about 2,000 of it altogether, because it just kept selling.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.430
It was like 40, 50 a week, and I had to run with a winner.

36:50.450 --> 36:51.591
And this is the pay-per-view?

36:51.631 --> 36:53.493
No, the hardback, 395.

36:53.613 --> 36:53.773
Wow.

36:54.794 --> 36:56.336
Okay.

36:56.356 --> 37:01.662
Then I called Harcourt for us to try and get another 500, because I kept pumping up my stock, you know?

37:02.114 --> 37:10.302
And the gal says to me, oh, the white sale's over, you can't have them anymore.

37:10.482 --> 37:18.309
So I said, well, you know, we did buy 2,000, and it's just the white sale's over in a couple of days.

37:18.329 --> 37:20.011
I'll tell you what, can I make a special deal with you and get 1,000 more?

37:20.271 --> 37:21.993
She says, well, I'll have to check.

37:22.013 --> 37:24.115
And she comes back, and she says, OK, you get 1,000 more.

37:25.816 --> 37:26.737
Mind you, I'm paying you $2 each.

37:26.757 --> 37:31.682
So I get the 1,000 in, and about three weeks later,

37:32.405 --> 37:35.568
Marlboro has them for $1.95.

37:38.911 --> 37:39.812
They dump the rest.

37:40.372 --> 37:42.895
So mind you, I had paid her $2.

37:42.995 --> 37:48.280
Now Marlboro is offering it for $1.95, that's 50%, so I can buy it from a dollar.

37:50.102 --> 37:57.408
So I place an order with Marlboro for another $1,000, and he gives them for me at $0.80 each.

37:57.428 --> 38:02.293
And I call Harper at this, and I said, look, you know, you charge me $2 for the book, and

38:02.712 --> 38:16.886
Now I get it for 80 cents.

38:16.906 --> 38:19.048
This isn't right.

38:19.069 --> 38:21.151
And she said, well, you're a tough one.

38:21.171 --> 38:26.016
So I had to go all the way up to Janovich, and he finally told her to keep me happy.

38:26.036 --> 38:26.436
That's a fair story.

38:26.456 --> 38:27.537
You could have just returned those books, actually.

38:27.557 --> 38:27.937
Well, you couldn't.

38:27.957 --> 38:28.538
It was a white sale.

38:28.878 --> 38:29.479
It was a white sale.

38:29.746 --> 38:35.699
I mean, in total, I probably got about 5,000, 6,000 copies on this remainder.

38:35.719 --> 38:39.087
Now, it took three, four years, five years or something.

38:39.107 --> 38:42.134
We finally sold them out.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.920
Now, we bought it as a new paperback.

38:45.659 --> 38:50.084
And we're selling it at a discount, what, from $6.95 to $7.95.

38:50.104 --> 38:51.206
And we're still selling it.

38:51.226 --> 38:53.749
And in fact, I'll give you a quota to that story.

38:53.829 --> 38:54.770
No, we're still selling.

38:54.810 --> 39:03.701
Well, when I went to Italy in November, I bought my copy here, because I needed it, and I wanted to read it before I entered it, and just ran at it.

39:04.201 --> 39:05.162
And I think I paid $7.98.

39:05.222 --> 39:05.623
$7.95, yeah.

39:05.643 --> 39:12.811
So that was, you know, I mean, partially it was a bestseller for me, because I got all the copies.

39:12.831 --> 39:14.113
There are other books that I got.

39:14.431 --> 39:17.976
5,000 copies of them.

39:18.637 --> 39:25.066
Do you do a lot of new books that you buy directly from the publisher?

39:25.186 --> 39:30.113
We buy a select number of new books from the publisher to satisfy our customers' needs.

39:30.133 --> 39:31.455
We sell them mostly at a 25% discount.

39:31.616 --> 39:32.397
The best sellers are 30 more.

39:32.417 --> 39:32.717
Close margin.

39:32.737 --> 39:33.238
We don't make much money.

39:33.258 --> 39:34.920
So you're competitive with the chains on that.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.823
I have to be competitive with the margins.

39:36.843 --> 39:37.384
I go below them.

39:37.404 --> 39:40.969
I don't want my customers walking out of here and walking up the bars and overs to get the books.

39:40.989 --> 39:41.670
I don't do it on all the books.

39:42.089 --> 39:58.085
all the best sellers.

39:58.105 --> 40:00.487
It's the best sellers that are more intellectual.

40:00.507 --> 40:01.268
Yeah, the quality will extend to that.

40:01.288 --> 40:04.231
We said that the biggest difference when you move to Fourth Avenue to here is that we have a lot of street traffic.

40:04.251 --> 40:05.252
So what was the nature of the business over there?

40:05.272 --> 40:06.293
Well, Fourth Avenue was a dying street.

40:06.313 --> 40:07.234
At one time, it used to be very, very active.

40:07.254 --> 40:07.774
Wanamakers was down there.

40:07.794 --> 40:09.016
On Saturday, the street was mobbed with people buying books.

40:09.036 --> 40:09.396
Wanamakers closed.

40:10.777 --> 40:29.640
How would you characterize, or can you characterize, the typical shenanigans of custody?

40:29.660 --> 40:32.163
We have early things from high school students coming in here and college families.

40:32.183 --> 40:32.343
Farmers.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.004
They usually buy a lot of books.

40:33.024 --> 40:33.765
That would be one characteristic.

40:33.785 --> 40:34.185
They're big readers.

40:34.705 --> 40:55.810
The typical customer will come in and buy one, is that right?

40:55.830 --> 40:56.971
They usually buy, yeah, it's not just one book at a time.

40:56.991 --> 40:58.833
The sales are generally four or five books, and sometimes 20 or 30, depending on who or not.

40:58.853 --> 40:59.855
And how do you keep it fresh?

40:59.875 --> 41:01.296
Are you constantly alert to moving new titles out front?

41:01.316 --> 41:01.977
Oh, yeah, the tables are changed.

41:01.997 --> 41:02.618
The display tables are changed.

41:02.638 --> 41:03.158
And the process is policy.

41:03.178 --> 41:04.560
Yeah, they're changed every week, and they're freshened up every day.

41:05.806 --> 41:22.729
We try to weed out the aisles of old books, and we always make sure that we put the new books on, and that's a real emphasis on all the shelters.

41:22.749 --> 41:26.574
Are you afraid that by expanding the store, changing it, that you're tinkering with something that really works well?

41:26.594 --> 41:31.020
Well, one of the architects that I, the architect that we've had, do the basic designs for us so far, is a, I can't pronounce his name,

41:31.675 --> 41:38.146
I've talked to him, by the way.

41:38.627 --> 41:42.474
In fact, I've got to do an article.

41:42.494 --> 41:42.634
Okay.

41:43.135 --> 41:43.235
Okay.

41:43.255 --> 41:44.578
And when I discussed... But I didn't discuss the screen.

41:44.598 --> 41:45.580
You can discuss it with him.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.541
He knows the screen.

41:46.561 --> 41:51.310
He's got a huge article library.

41:51.330 --> 41:51.991
I'm going to go see it.

41:52.011 --> 41:53.734
One of the things I said to him when we were talking about it, I said to him

41:54.254 --> 42:09.495
If you take the job, do you think it would make the story as it was before?

42:09.515 --> 42:10.456
He's done the Trump, but I did a search on him.

42:10.476 --> 42:12.499
His reputation has been made in taking historic old buildings, Manhattan buildings, and adapting them

42:13.019 --> 42:17.566
making them modern but retaining the character.

42:17.867 --> 42:22.534
His resume is really unbelievable.

42:22.775 --> 42:31.629
I've done a very interesting background search.

42:32.851 --> 42:33.171
Hello.

42:36.897 --> 42:48.337
Do you think of any interesting anecdotes over the years, any really good, strange stories?

42:49.058 --> 42:53.886
Are there any really that you can think of?

42:53.906 --> 42:54.046
Sure.

42:54.066 --> 42:54.527
Where is he?

42:54.547 --> 42:54.988
What anecdotes?

42:55.008 --> 42:55.909
Well, I remember it was fun.

42:55.929 --> 42:58.554
I remember when I was 16 years old, it was all my father and my grandfather and I had to see everybody's eyes and things.

42:58.574 --> 42:58.955
What year was that?

42:58.975 --> 42:59.816
Well, I've got a lot of things.

42:59.836 --> 43:00.016
Oh, okay.

43:00.036 --> 43:00.357
Nancy, so Nancy.

43:04.741 --> 43:25.545
Don't worry about it.

43:25.565 --> 43:25.745
Go ahead.

43:25.765 --> 43:26.305
Yeah, don't worry about it.

43:26.325 --> 43:26.506
Go ahead.

43:26.526 --> 43:26.906
Some great stories.

43:26.926 --> 43:29.089
Well, you know, it's kind of fun, this whole thing with, we bought this library out in, out in the Hamptons.

43:29.109 --> 43:29.449
Oterio's Library.

43:32.602 --> 43:34.005
Phyllis Stine's at the Hedge Grove.

43:34.627 --> 43:35.108
Oh, sure.

43:35.328 --> 43:37.834
But it doesn't have the whole story.

43:37.934 --> 43:39.638
And my father can tell you more.

43:39.658 --> 43:45.310
Marginbothal originally arranged for his father's beautiful art library.

43:45.330 --> 43:48.016
Excuse me, it was at this place called The Creek.

43:48.037 --> 43:49.159
Just so I could see it.

43:50.472 --> 44:13.759
And I guess Ron Perlman had it, you know, bought this place, this huge estate, and told this guy Ted Dragon, you know, Sarah's lover, that he had to move out with him to win.

44:13.779 --> 44:15.821
So they had us buy the whole estate, and it was huge, and we got three truckloads, and not in all abs.

44:15.841 --> 44:16.642
And then Ron Perlman... Can we get that?

44:16.662 --> 44:16.762
Yeah.

44:16.782 --> 44:17.203
Can I get a question?

44:17.223 --> 44:17.323
Sure.

44:25.336 --> 44:33.529
And then Ron Perlman took this beautiful estate and converted it into what he wanted.

44:33.549 --> 44:41.482
And then he called me up and he ordered books for me.

44:41.502 --> 44:46.029
For all the cottages, the guest cottages for the Mayhouse.

44:46.049 --> 44:50.196
Ron Perlman, he's Revlon, he's one of the biggest.

44:51.678 --> 45:01.330
He had emphasis on fiction and American history.

45:01.771 --> 45:03.673
It was kind of fun.

45:03.853 --> 45:07.217
I have already written a piece I did for this Four Seasons magazine.

45:07.297 --> 45:08.219
Right, that you sent me.

45:08.239 --> 45:10.141
Which is how you build libraries for people.

45:10.161 --> 45:11.523
Tell me a little bit about that.

45:11.783 --> 45:12.284
Oh, it's so much fun.

45:12.304 --> 45:14.226
I know I've already got some information on it, and I'll probably use that again.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.103
But does that happen often?

45:17.144 --> 45:17.564
All the time.

45:17.584 --> 45:19.628
I did three yesterday.

45:19.709 --> 45:23.496
Actually, it's kind of fun because somebody asked my father, what does he like best in the book business?

45:23.696 --> 45:28.466
My father said he loves getting the estate and going through big lots.

45:28.626 --> 45:31.051
It's almost a treasure hunt for him.

45:31.071 --> 45:33.656
My favorite thing at the store is putting together libraries.

45:33.796 --> 45:37.463
One person taking them apart, one person putting them together.

45:38.050 --> 45:40.777
So I do lots of libraries.

45:40.877 --> 45:45.047
I do three different kinds, basically.

45:45.067 --> 45:49.158
One is just filler books.

45:50.942 --> 45:55.333
Hi.

45:55.921 --> 45:56.763
Okay.

45:56.783 --> 45:58.526
Basically, there are three kinds of libraries I do.

45:58.546 --> 46:01.432
I do a lot of just the books by the foot, like they don't care at all.

46:01.973 --> 46:04.258
And our cheapest is $10 a foot.

46:04.278 --> 46:06.623
Now, these are you selling or renting?

46:06.904 --> 46:07.425
Selling.

46:07.485 --> 46:07.645
Selling.

46:07.685 --> 46:07.886
Yeah.

46:07.906 --> 46:10.471
I mean, I can do a rental on it.

46:10.511 --> 46:11.533
It's the same way.

46:12.188 --> 46:15.334
You sell people books at $10 and running for it.

46:15.454 --> 46:15.574
Right.

46:15.895 --> 46:19.802
And I ask them, do you want old books or do you want new books or do you want a mixture?

46:19.822 --> 46:21.364
And so I just do it.

46:21.485 --> 46:22.667
A lot of people just call up.

46:22.687 --> 46:23.609
They give me their credit card.

46:23.629 --> 46:24.530
We just ship it out to them.

46:24.550 --> 46:25.031
What do they want?

46:25.051 --> 46:26.113
They tell me how many feet.

46:26.498 --> 46:27.559
It depends.

46:27.579 --> 46:31.523
I mean, some people don't care what they have in their house.

46:31.543 --> 46:33.425
This is actually for decoration.

46:33.445 --> 46:34.166
Yeah, decoration.

46:34.186 --> 46:35.468
Some people it's for shoots.

46:35.488 --> 46:36.789
You know, it just depends.

46:37.410 --> 46:40.553
I've done lots and lots of hotels.

46:40.573 --> 46:43.937
They usually want just reading material for their clients.

46:43.957 --> 46:46.780
It's not even reading or it's just something that fills shelves.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.822
It's for ambience or something like that?

46:48.842 --> 46:52.566
Yeah, it's mostly, I think, well, it could be for either one.

46:52.586 --> 46:53.287
You don't ask.

46:53.307 --> 46:54.548
Mostly for filling.

46:54.933 --> 46:56.498
But they have to look good?

46:56.518 --> 46:57.361
Oh yeah, they look good.

46:57.381 --> 47:00.530
Are you alert to how the spines are going to look?

47:00.550 --> 47:02.497
Oh yeah, absolutely.

47:02.517 --> 47:06.750
So you're actually selecting them as if they were fruit or tomatoes or something, right?

47:06.770 --> 47:07.612
Yeah, butterflies.

47:07.673 --> 47:09.077
They have to project an appearance?

47:09.412 --> 47:09.853
Yes.

47:09.873 --> 47:10.834
So do you look for color?

47:10.914 --> 47:11.856
Do you do things like that?

47:11.876 --> 47:24.515
Well, if they tell me if they have, I ask them if they have any preferences, and sometimes, you know, I, well, for instance, I did one in Florida, and they told me only, you know, bright colors, like hot pinks and yellows and things like that, so I did that for that.

47:24.535 --> 47:25.417
That was with Laura.

47:25.437 --> 47:25.557
Yeah.

47:25.577 --> 47:26.999
I think my own age, right?

47:27.039 --> 47:27.640
Right, right, right.

47:27.957 --> 47:29.179
So it just really depends.

47:29.199 --> 47:33.847
And then, you know, if they have somebody open up a restaurant, it's more like a brewery type restaurant.

47:33.907 --> 47:35.169
We pick the older books.

47:35.309 --> 47:41.580
If it's more for hotel reading, we do fiction books, usually clean kind of fiction for that.

47:42.581 --> 47:46.708
So you do, there is some degree of selection in royalty.

47:47.043 --> 47:48.124
Whatever they want.

47:48.224 --> 47:51.327
Sometimes, usually it's not all that much.

47:51.588 --> 47:53.269
That's one.

47:53.990 --> 47:59.956
Well, another thing that I do is usually like leather-looking or leather books, either way.

47:59.976 --> 48:01.498
It's still by the running foot now.

48:01.518 --> 48:02.659
Yeah, it's still by the running foot.

48:02.679 --> 48:06.223
Leather-looking, it's $50 a foot.

48:07.284 --> 48:10.307
And leather books, it depends on what kind of degree it is.

48:10.327 --> 48:13.270
It starts at $200 a foot from the actual leather books.

48:14.026 --> 48:21.513
And then the third category would be when they really want, you know, subject areas and for me to really put together a great library on any subject.

48:21.613 --> 48:22.794
That's a lot.

48:22.814 --> 48:24.856
So tell me some kinds of the subjects.

48:24.876 --> 48:27.899
You mentioned Steven Spielberg's library.

48:27.919 --> 48:28.039
Right.

48:28.059 --> 48:36.567
And that was basically what the art, he just wanted a library, but apparently he wanted the arts or he wanted... Yeah, he wanted, he gave me a budget.

48:36.587 --> 48:37.728
It was a little bit in reverse.

48:37.748 --> 48:38.789
I didn't get the footage.

48:38.909 --> 48:40.050
I got how much money.

48:40.070 --> 48:41.051
How much he was willing to spend.

48:41.292 --> 48:41.772
Yeah.

48:42.899 --> 48:47.586
I'm trying to remember, I think it was $30,000.

48:47.606 --> 48:50.069
And I got the credit card, and then we delivered them.

48:50.109 --> 48:51.171
They wanted it done right away.

48:51.211 --> 48:58.020
I mean, usually these things, it's kind of funny because you think books are... I always have book emergencies happening all the time.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.923
Oh, congratulations.

49:00.003 --> 49:00.163
Yeah.

49:00.183 --> 49:00.744
Only in New York.

49:00.824 --> 49:01.205
Right.

49:01.785 --> 49:04.810
Yeah, I mean, you know, a lot of set designs, too, we'll change that.

49:04.830 --> 49:09.396
We'll do... Because the movie industry is really here right now, so we'll do a lot of the...

49:10.034 --> 49:15.881
The director will change their mind about shooting and I'll have to get the books to them by this afternoon.

49:15.901 --> 49:20.306
There'll be book emergencies whenever people have parties.

49:20.367 --> 49:28.436
A party that I had to get things FedEx overnight into Maine so that they could have the party.

49:28.556 --> 49:29.838
Obviously there's no logic.

49:30.459 --> 49:33.122
FedEx is going to be expensive.

49:33.271 --> 49:37.799
And I hate that because I would much rather have them buy more books or better quality books.

49:37.859 --> 49:47.255
You mentioned once that you had a dinner party with candlelight and all this stuff and she wanted the leather books.

49:49.238 --> 49:50.761
What's your rental fee then by the way?

49:50.781 --> 49:52.123
Do you also have a rental fee?

49:52.143 --> 49:54.587
Usually it's half of what our

49:56.272 --> 49:58.335
or purchase prices.

49:58.355 --> 50:00.457
So if it's $10 a foot, it'll be $5 a foot.

50:00.477 --> 50:00.658
$5, yeah.

50:00.778 --> 50:01.539
But how long?

50:01.599 --> 50:10.350
I actually don't care that much about how long, because it's all about putting the books together and giving it to them and doing the administrative stuff.

50:10.370 --> 50:17.099
We have so many books here that immediately the spot gets filled in right away, so it's not really like a lost opportunity.

50:17.239 --> 50:22.085
So I usually, you know, I've done six-month rentals even.

50:22.366 --> 50:23.427
They even have me

50:23.896 --> 50:31.615
and sending books out to California for movies.

50:31.635 --> 50:33.199
Any particular movies?

50:33.219 --> 50:34.783
I'm not such a media person.

50:35.050 --> 50:36.452
Was it Twilight?

50:36.472 --> 50:37.313
Was that a new movie?

50:37.333 --> 50:39.216
That was the one out in California.

50:39.236 --> 50:39.997
You can think of any.

50:40.017 --> 50:40.719
I'll give you a call.

50:40.959 --> 50:43.943
Let me just give you a newspaper and I'll tell you what one's.

50:43.983 --> 50:46.307
First Live Club, Godfather, Fray.

50:46.387 --> 50:48.130
I'll call you next week.

50:48.210 --> 50:48.410
Okay.

50:48.651 --> 50:48.931
So many.

50:48.951 --> 50:51.815
There'll be things to go over anyway.

50:51.835 --> 50:56.082
When you're actually asked to build a library as you work with Spielberg.

50:56.162 --> 50:56.282
Right.

50:56.920 --> 51:00.367
What do you, I mean, now, what do you bring, what do you bring to bear here?

51:00.387 --> 51:01.590
Do you call librarians?

51:01.810 --> 51:09.025
Do you ask, I mean, if you're really trying to build a strong library, what kind of criteria are you applying?

51:09.767 --> 51:13.795
Well, I always do it as if that was a library that I would want to have.

51:13.815 --> 51:15.739
So that's where, that's what I base it on.

51:15.719 --> 51:22.671
And then I will go to the art department, to Richard, the head of the art department, and I'll say, what's the best books on this subject?

51:22.772 --> 51:25.877
And he'll help me with that, or I'll go to Craig and there are books.

51:25.897 --> 51:29.904
And it will be a mix of second-hand rare and new books.

51:29.985 --> 51:31.888
Yeah, I mean, it depends on their budget first.

51:33.016 --> 51:39.404
I gave him a lot of rare books because I really wanted a high quality library for them.

51:39.424 --> 51:40.725
Did you hear it back?

51:40.745 --> 51:41.847
Did he like it?

51:41.867 --> 51:46.432
I got it through a decorator, Naomi Leff and Associates.

51:46.452 --> 51:48.295
She's really big.

51:48.415 --> 51:51.859
Naomi Leff and Associates.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.822
How do you spell her name?

51:54.842 --> 51:56.104
N-A-O-M-I and L-E-O-F-F Associates.

51:56.557 --> 52:02.182
And so I've done libraries for Tom Cruise with her, too.

52:02.202 --> 52:05.326
But you've done a library for Tom Cruise?

52:05.346 --> 52:05.526
Yeah.

52:05.546 --> 52:08.268
Do you think a guy like Cruise would go pick his own books?

52:08.308 --> 52:11.932
Well, they don't have time, and they want a great library.

52:11.952 --> 52:12.713
It's the best thing to do.

52:12.733 --> 52:14.194
I mean, these people are working all the time.

52:14.214 --> 52:16.977
I would do it that way if I had the money and no time.

52:16.997 --> 52:20.200
And I've done it for the Hearsts.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.082
You mean Randolph's head first?

52:22.262 --> 52:22.362
Yeah.

52:24.974 --> 52:41.225
Actually, I don't really know if it was... Is that the only one that's... I'm pretty sure it was William.

52:41.245 --> 52:43.690
Yeah, is that the only one that's... He's in the Hearst organization, and he's singing all the... I wouldn't use that one.

52:43.710 --> 52:44.171
You can say the Hearst.

52:44.191 --> 52:44.692
The Hearst.

52:44.712 --> 52:45.193
Yeah, because I don't...

52:45.815 --> 52:51.625
When did you, this is something you originated, right?

52:51.965 --> 52:53.287
Do you call it?

52:53.368 --> 52:54.329
What do you call it?

52:54.610 --> 52:56.032
Well, the book rentals originally originated.

52:56.172 --> 52:58.937
I mean, Fred had been doing libraries, but not to such an extent as I did.

52:59.077 --> 53:00.559
I put them in all the production.

53:00.580 --> 53:02.102
I advertised in all the production books.

53:02.082 --> 53:06.854
And I got a good reputation around with the prop people.

53:06.874 --> 53:11.527
I mean, it's just a small community, so once they know that you're reliable and that you can do good work.

53:12.228 --> 53:17.121
And they tell me, a lot of times they call up and they'll tell me what their characters are in the movie and they'll tell me if he did it.

53:17.101 --> 53:24.649
Yeah, so I'll just pretend that I'm, you know, let's say, a girl 13 years old likes books on horses.

53:24.669 --> 53:25.710
That must be fun.

53:25.730 --> 53:26.270
It is fun.

53:26.350 --> 53:27.151
It's imaginary.

53:27.171 --> 53:29.774
Have you ever seen any of your books in front of the movies?

53:29.894 --> 53:30.394
Oh, yeah.

53:30.594 --> 53:32.957
I mean, even the Today Show in the background.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.498
Those are yours?

53:34.839 --> 53:37.461
Yeah, we do all of NBC, ABC, CBS.

53:37.481 --> 53:40.845
Oh, that's great.

53:40.865 --> 53:42.326
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

53:42.466 --> 53:44.288
Cradle Will Rock we're doing now.

53:45.469 --> 53:46.230
How old do you answer?

53:46.801 --> 53:47.122
37.

53:47.242 --> 53:49.846
And how old is your father?

53:49.866 --> 53:49.946
70.

53:49.966 --> 53:54.914
So, tell me a little bit about the future.

53:54.934 --> 53:56.296
The future of the business.

53:56.497 --> 53:57.979
The future of the store?

53:57.999 --> 53:58.099
Yeah.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.962
Well, I hope to be running it.

54:00.083 --> 54:03.408
30 years from now, we're not rolling.

54:03.648 --> 54:05.932
I want to do this for the rest of my life.

54:05.952 --> 54:07.214
So, how do you see the strand in the year 2030?

54:07.234 --> 54:09.698
Well, I want to get the second floor.

54:09.718 --> 54:10.680
I want to advertise.

54:10.820 --> 54:12.623
I want to have the

54:12.957 --> 54:22.495
downstairs i want to have the sign expanded all the way out and to have carts all the way on the floor you know all throughout the side and i want to have um

54:22.694 --> 54:48.141
either stairway or escalator leading up to the second floor, and all the floors kind of united into the four floors, so it's easy access into all of them, and to always keep it in an old-style store, and emphasize maybe that it was founded in 1927, and that there's a family goodness, and always emphasize the used books.

54:48.161 --> 54:48.601
Always emphasize what?

54:48.621 --> 54:48.922
The used books.

54:48.942 --> 54:50.003
What is it about the used books?

54:50.023 --> 54:51.064
I know for me, whenever I go into any new city,

54:51.280 --> 54:59.156
The first thing I look for is... Office?

54:59.176 --> 54:59.658
Can you call for a team?

54:59.678 --> 54:59.939
I'm not sure.

54:59.959 --> 55:00.160
Okay, bye.

55:00.460 --> 55:20.978
I'm always looking for the secondhand bookstores.

55:20.998 --> 55:21.578
What is it about these books?

55:21.598 --> 55:22.319
Well, they're much more interesting.

55:22.339 --> 55:23.020
There's a whole history behind it.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.081
And you never know what you're going to find, right?

55:24.101 --> 55:25.262
And you're going to find books that you never do exist in.

55:25.282 --> 55:25.402
Right.

55:25.422 --> 55:26.322
That are going to be absolutely irresistible.

55:26.343 --> 55:28.184
That's why a woman interviewed me last night from the West Coast about the Berkeley Library.

55:28.204 --> 55:29.866
This new book, as I mentioned, is dealing with a lot, but the library is a problem.

55:29.886 --> 55:30.366
She was interviewing me.

55:31.156 --> 55:34.180
And he said, tell me what it is about going into a library with a lot of books.

55:34.340 --> 55:35.341
And I said, I'll give you an example.

55:35.361 --> 55:38.205
Last Friday, I was at Whitener Library at Harvard.

55:38.225 --> 55:42.431
And I went in specifically to get a book that I can't find anyplace else.

55:42.511 --> 55:44.353
And I'll check it online.

55:44.373 --> 55:46.115
Plus, the public doesn't have it happening.

55:46.135 --> 55:47.397
It doesn't have it.

55:47.417 --> 55:49.480
They can't even get it out into a library alone.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.122
And I went in, and I got it fine.

55:51.142 --> 55:53.485
But while I'm there getting this book,

55:54.258 --> 56:00.785
you know, three volumes over to the right is a book I've never heard of.

56:01.326 --> 56:05.530
And I said, let me tell you what it is, because I Xeroxed the whole thing.

56:05.550 --> 56:08.153
And I said, that's the beauty of going into a library.

56:08.173 --> 56:09.335
It's the beauty of a secondhand bookstore.

56:09.355 --> 56:12.878
It's finding a book that's even more interesting than the one you were looking for.

56:12.979 --> 56:19.886
You know, as interesting as the book on the Durham Cathedral Library was that I was looking for, this other book on medieval English libraries was infinitely more fascinating.

56:19.906 --> 56:21.548
And I think that's, I'm sorry, that's a long,

56:22.304 --> 56:40.027
You're absolutely right.

56:40.047 --> 56:41.309
But that's kind of what happens, I think.

56:41.329 --> 56:42.690
I don't even mind when books are written on inside.

56:42.710 --> 56:43.251
I mean, I like to see that.

56:43.271 --> 56:43.632
I like that, too.

56:43.652 --> 56:45.113
Tomorrow, I'm talking about Tony Grafton, Anthony Grafton, got his books.

56:45.133 --> 56:47.937
I'm seeing him at Princeton, because he's writing about readers, the readers of books, as reflected by the annotations that they've entered.

56:47.957 --> 56:48.298
Oh, that's funny.

56:48.318 --> 56:49.880
History, you know, what you can tell about readers through history.

56:49.900 --> 56:50.280
Pretty interesting.

56:50.300 --> 56:50.961
I love books that have a history.

56:50.941 --> 57:14.112
It's much better to give gifts like that when people are giving new books.

57:14.132 --> 57:17.877
On the occasion that General Madness was published, I acquired a book that was published in 1851, New England authors, and it had been given by a man to his wife in 1851, and then a child

57:18.312 --> 57:28.926
I couldn't follow, but then a second generation had given to somebody else, written in there.

57:29.286 --> 57:32.931
And then I wrote in a hundred years later, you know, on the pub date and Gentle Madness, you know, blah, blah.

57:32.951 --> 57:35.855
And she said, gee, should you have done that to that book?

57:35.875 --> 57:39.139
I said, number one, trust me, we've just made it a very valuable book.

57:39.159 --> 57:40.160
This is not right now a very valuable book.

57:40.180 --> 57:43.224
If anything ever becomes Gentle Madness, which it did.

57:43.244 --> 57:44.826
But, you know, it's kind of nice to have a,

57:45.346 --> 57:50.034
to see the history of this book over 149 years.

57:50.756 --> 57:55.063
I think I'm basically supporting the dresser there.

57:55.083 --> 57:58.409
Again, so your plans for, your thoughts, what do you think?

57:58.429 --> 58:01.415
Well, we are getting the books on computer right now.

58:01.435 --> 58:04.921
And you bought the building, so you know you're going to be here.

58:04.941 --> 58:05.121
Yeah.

58:05.141 --> 58:05.582
That's terrific.

58:05.866 --> 58:14.009
So the books on computer are actually getting on computer much quicker than I ever imagined, and the technology is really good with it.

58:14.029 --> 58:15.052
You mean entering the inventory?

58:15.072 --> 58:20.888
Yeah, so that's going to happen, and we're definitely looking at the web.

58:20.868 --> 58:30.219
Do you have a website yet?

58:30.239 --> 58:32.442
Not yet, no.

58:32.462 --> 58:36.546
We want to have the books on there, too.

58:37.968 --> 58:44.236
We want to have an accurate inventory, so we're working that out right now.

58:44.256 --> 58:45.177
Do you have any figures that you can disclose?

58:45.197 --> 58:45.557
Sales are like 29.

58:45.577 --> 58:45.978
I don't do the rest.

58:45.998 --> 58:48.040
That's fine.

58:48.340 --> 58:49.541
I think we look funny.

58:49.561 --> 58:52.824
What do you think?

58:53.205 --> 58:58.790
Is there anything that I haven't asked you that I should know that you can think of?

58:58.810 --> 58:59.751
How about your father?

58:59.951 --> 59:03.755
I mean, were books always a part of your life?

59:03.775 --> 59:06.077
Yes.

59:06.097 --> 59:08.639
My brother, on the other hand.

59:08.920 --> 59:12.703
What's your brother's name?

59:15.426 --> 59:15.986
Stephen.

59:16.006 --> 59:16.327
With a V or a V?

59:16.347 --> 59:16.867
With a V. It's an E-V-E-N.

59:16.887 --> 59:16.987
Yeah.

59:17.007 --> 59:17.908
He's older or younger?

59:18.040 --> 59:24.509
He's eight years older, but he's got a design eye.

59:24.529 --> 59:26.271
He's not that interested.

59:26.311 --> 59:28.174
What does he do?

59:28.194 --> 59:30.898
He does renovations and architectural.

59:30.918 --> 59:32.500
Are you a reader?

59:32.520 --> 59:33.401
Do you read a lot?

59:33.481 --> 59:34.503
Yeah, I do.

59:34.603 --> 59:35.524
I read all kinds of things.

59:35.544 --> 59:43.355
I think this is funny, though, because as much of a sickness as the people that bring home the books and collect them, I have a sickness where I don't really want to accumulate books at all.

59:43.495 --> 59:43.575
Why?

59:44.028 --> 59:51.497
Because I just, I read them, and if I like the book, I want to make sure it comes back to the store so that it can be resold or somebody else can enjoy it.

59:51.517 --> 59:52.938
But you have so many books here, too.

59:53.078 --> 01:00:00.847
Yeah, yeah, because I think maybe this is my home, and so I don't really, you know... But I think that's contrary to everyone else.

01:00:00.867 --> 01:00:05.412
I don't know if anyone else is like that, so... How about you, Fred?

01:00:05.432 --> 01:00:08.336
Are you a... Have you always been a... We just talked about Nancy.

01:00:08.356 --> 01:00:13.782
I asked her, you know, books have always been a part of her life, and she's a leader, but she likes to bring them back.

01:00:14.302 --> 01:00:23.460
Well, I'd maintain a library at home with about 1,500 books.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:28.069
And my general rule is when I bring something home, I've got to bring something back to rotate it.

01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:32.317
It keeps creeping up on me, but if I didn't do that, my house would look like my warehouse up here.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:32.918
But I'm overwhelmed by books.
