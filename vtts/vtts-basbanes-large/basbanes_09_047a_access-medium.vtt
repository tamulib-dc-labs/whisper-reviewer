WEBVTT

00:03.608 --> 00:06.491
Make sure it's going.

00:06.511 --> 00:07.031
It's going.

00:07.051 --> 00:08.833
I'm talking to Joseph Phillips.

00:08.853 --> 00:09.474
It'll pick you up.

00:09.834 --> 00:10.214
It'll be fine.

00:10.234 --> 00:10.435
Okay.

00:10.475 --> 00:11.376
Can I talk?

00:11.396 --> 00:11.816
Okay, please.

00:11.836 --> 00:12.877
You're picking me up.

00:12.977 --> 00:13.538
Okay.

00:13.558 --> 00:14.579
I'm glad you love the book.

00:15.179 --> 00:18.583
So far, everybody loves the book, except the New York Times.

00:18.723 --> 00:22.827
It seems to me disappointed because I didn't say more.

00:23.447 --> 00:24.789
That was Michiko.

00:24.829 --> 00:26.390
That's Michiko.

00:26.690 --> 00:27.912
And the Sunday Times.

00:28.032 --> 00:28.812
Okay.

00:28.993 --> 00:30.074
I didn't see the Sunday Times.

00:30.094 --> 00:33.497
He was a little bit happy with me because I seemed smart.

00:33.612 --> 00:37.276
You tend to forget some things, I guess.

00:37.296 --> 00:38.317
No, I don't forget them.

00:38.337 --> 00:42.482
No, I mean, in Miki goes with you, you tend to have a bad memory on some things.

00:42.542 --> 00:49.150
No, because I didn't choose to write, actually.

00:49.170 --> 00:55.757
I chose the personality or the biography, or biography, which is something I wanted to write about.

00:55.958 --> 01:00.683
In this book, I wanted to give someone such material that should be related to my work.

01:00.950 --> 01:08.738
You don't mind if I just poop this a little bit?

01:08.838 --> 01:08.998
Nope.

01:09.098 --> 01:14.464
You're not using this, right?

01:14.504 --> 01:14.704
No.

01:17.387 --> 01:17.907
What?

01:17.987 --> 01:21.771
You're talking about, you wanted to write a memoir.

01:21.791 --> 01:25.455
Yeah, well, that's what's going on.

01:25.807 --> 01:28.551
relationship between me and what I've done in my novels.

01:29.452 --> 01:42.610
In closing, there was so much of a personal nature there in the lives of two fictional characters that I realized I was actually writing about myself and my own past to a large extent.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.874
And this is a clarification and a continuation.

01:46.090 --> 01:56.204
Plus the fact that over the years, very many people have been interested in Tony Allen, wondered why I didn't write something about Tony Allen.

01:56.224 --> 01:57.005
It's a mystical place.

01:57.366 --> 01:58.107
And I love it.

01:58.267 --> 02:02.854
I love it personally and agree totally with Jonathan Yardley's review on the last of course.

02:02.994 --> 02:04.656
And he said, just

02:04.889 --> 02:09.218
If all you wrote about was Coney Island, you would recommend the book unhesitatingly.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.910
Because of that very, it is, it has a magical kind of version.

02:16.293 --> 02:21.143
And it was an absolutely wonderful place to go up in.

02:21.123 --> 02:30.135
When I grew up there, I and the hundreds of other kids who became great, I cannot think of a better place to grow up.

02:30.155 --> 02:36.703
Even the absence of money for luxury had a good effect on the character and the temperament.

02:36.723 --> 02:39.086
But me and the people I've kept in touch with.

02:39.106 --> 02:42.270
You tell that wonderful story about the guy giving you

02:42.250 --> 02:43.712
10 bucks.

02:45.173 --> 02:46.054
Newt paper?

02:46.174 --> 02:46.615
Yeah.

02:46.655 --> 02:47.496
10 cents.

02:47.516 --> 02:50.700
10 cents.

02:51.260 --> 02:54.344
And you said, you know, I just recently got a check for 18 grand.

02:54.364 --> 02:55.645
The 10 cents was better.

02:55.725 --> 02:56.886
Yeah.

02:56.906 --> 02:58.688
Any one of us can relate to that.

02:58.709 --> 03:01.031
I remember I was waiting on tables as a kid.

03:01.051 --> 03:01.772
Yeah.

03:01.872 --> 03:05.696
And a guy that left me a $20 chip wasn't great.

03:05.716 --> 03:10.722
I mean, it was... And then I had to go and get cars after that.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.216
You literally never know that pleasure.

03:13.316 --> 03:15.161
Some pleasure money can't buy.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.286
Right, it's wonderful.

03:17.687 --> 03:26.348
In writing, deciding to write a non-fictional work, do you find that you have put a lot of yourself into a novel?

03:26.733 --> 03:32.382
But you can still hide behind fictional characters and imagining situations.

03:32.423 --> 03:42.199
The prospect of actually writing about yourself, using your names, and being faithful with the necessity of having even sort of indulgent confession of some sort.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.246
How did you respond to that prospect?

03:46.326 --> 03:51.795
It was a kind of thrilling form of therapy for me to look at myself.

03:52.113 --> 04:00.587
Well, first thing I was able to do in that couple of years of psychoanalysis, I had no time in writing this, and Manly came up.

04:01.508 --> 04:14.830
And when I was confused, I began talking to my older sister about very personal matters, very personal, and the family, and things that I hadn't known before, hadn't remembered or had not known.

04:15.248 --> 04:22.259
and discovering things about myself, which some were starting.

04:22.299 --> 04:26.405
The discovery, for example, the death of my father and I was five.

04:26.685 --> 04:28.508
Amazing you didn't know that.

04:28.528 --> 04:35.839
But also, when I did this job, it was a very big, irry move of watching my emotions and my feelings about it.

04:36.646 --> 04:39.129
I cannot remember any more than I've been.

04:39.189 --> 04:42.674
There were two or three incidents I have in that last paragraph.

04:42.774 --> 04:48.602
And I should remember, because I was five and a half.

04:48.702 --> 04:51.626
And one of two things is like that.

04:51.686 --> 04:57.434
But there would be a lot of wearing for a whole week when the Jewish father died, the Jewish father died.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.996
I have no memory of that.

04:59.196 --> 05:00.118
You're five years old.

05:00.178 --> 05:01.459
I mean, it's five years old.

05:01.479 --> 05:02.641
It's maybe, you know.

05:02.681 --> 05:05.385
I can remember other things around me.

05:06.046 --> 05:06.366
Really?

05:06.346 --> 05:13.369
But even if I was sent away to be spared, in which case that separation would have been a shock loss, I would remember that.

05:13.653 --> 05:19.944
Although I was there, I didn't block without a child.

05:19.964 --> 05:23.070
At Istanbul, I had a very close family life.

05:23.490 --> 05:27.597
Outwardly, externally, very happy childhood.

05:27.678 --> 05:35.692
Internally, I'm aware now that there's indications of nervousness and anxiety, like the nail-biting, for example.

05:35.712 --> 05:37.014
And you still do that?

05:37.074 --> 05:37.635
Oh, yeah.

05:37.801 --> 05:49.925
I don't know if you could just explore the decision to relate the memoir to the writing, because there is so much memoir stuff going around.

05:49.945 --> 05:50.386
I know.

05:50.466 --> 05:56.738
Did you see the piece in yesterday's New York Times about non-fictional books today, which are a bunch of books?

05:57.038 --> 05:59.280
non-fiction, they're inventing things.

06:00.562 --> 06:08.910
Because apparently that's selling, you know, and the more confession that you're willing to put in there, apparently the more saleable it becomes, even if it's not true.

06:11.954 --> 06:17.640
Looking back over my life, I don't have that much to confess.

06:18.040 --> 06:24.767
My impression is that it's fairly uneventful life compared

06:25.405 --> 06:34.394
I could say the Nelson Ordon, or Norman Mail, or Sean Bellow, which is a number of wives.

06:34.875 --> 06:39.380
My impression has been a fairly tranquil, even, unpredictable life.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.884
The most exciting of the novel coming from the success of the novelists.

06:44.124 --> 06:50.451
The world's heritage, but to your generation, might seem extraordinary to see.

06:50.718 --> 06:53.501
I'm 54, so my generation's not that crappy.

06:53.541 --> 06:54.883
No, you weren't in the war.

06:56.084 --> 07:07.558
In my generation, what I went through in the war was something that two million Americans went through, and none of them were dramatic, dangerous situations that I had.

07:08.379 --> 07:11.663
So it was the Tony Island background.

07:12.132 --> 07:25.288
I had an effort to confess to what little I had to confess to, to give myself and to give readers an understanding of my own background.

07:26.209 --> 07:36.402
The situation in this country after high school, or even before finishing high school, I tried to find a job after the age of 16.

07:36.753 --> 07:44.303
To my knowledge, of coming out of Brooklyn, everybody succeeded, even though it was a period of the Depression.

07:44.904 --> 07:49.230
The people that come out of Brooklyn have achieved.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.373
It was extraordinary.

07:52.134 --> 07:54.517
You can go down the list.

07:54.537 --> 07:57.702
It's just an amazing cast of characters.

07:57.722 --> 08:03.790
I can name it the two things that were contributed to last year.

08:04.208 --> 08:12.336
One is a large population of Brooklyn, the lowest one to five boroughs.

08:12.356 --> 08:19.703
In my life, I've always had a population of more than two million, which probably is larger than the population of Boston.

08:19.783 --> 08:22.085
But make it the fifth largest city in America.

08:22.606 --> 08:24.988
And the second thing is it was a depression backlash.

08:25.228 --> 08:34.097
It's filled in us a desire to achieve something as soon as we were able to.

08:34.263 --> 08:40.396
There was always a need for money, even though it was not best efficient.

08:40.857 --> 08:54.246
There were things we knew that we could buy if we had more money, so I think there was that drive that helped motivate people.

08:54.817 --> 08:56.299
Yeah.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.182
Brooklyn's probably the fifth largest city.

08:59.222 --> 09:00.843
Something like that.

09:00.884 --> 09:08.632
They have that sign out there, and Brooklyn would have made America's fifth largest city.

09:09.112 --> 09:09.473
Whatever.

09:09.553 --> 09:10.674
I'm sorry.

09:11.135 --> 09:15.079
And then there was the economic expansion.

09:15.499 --> 09:20.304
Came with World War II and continued after World War II.

09:20.405 --> 09:22.447
Opportunity for success.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.608
The whole range of money.

09:23.588 --> 09:51.553
I also think the fact that you have so many

09:51.533 --> 09:54.517
Immigrants are not settling in there.

09:54.537 --> 09:59.483
You know, immigrants, my background is Greek, and my grandparents come from Greece.

09:59.503 --> 10:03.668
They come here to work, and they're just going around.

10:03.688 --> 10:07.252
It's pushing the kids forward, and they're going to do better than me.

10:07.452 --> 10:09.414
And the feeling that you're lucky to find work.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.318
You're lucky to find any rest you can do.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.060
I'm traveling around now, I think.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.702
I think that's the same spirit.

10:16.373 --> 10:17.915
amount of immigration.

10:18.275 --> 10:35.794
When I say a hotel, most of the help, much of the help of hotels in California, it's Mexican, in New York, it's Indian, Asian Indian, I noticed on this trip, Spanish, Hispanic, so I think that often, and they're happy.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.416
They're making money.

10:37.456 --> 10:44.423
You or I or my children, or yours if you have them, would feel like failure if they had to go to work in a restaurant in a hotel.

10:44.403 --> 10:47.146
Or be chamomile.

10:47.287 --> 10:50.631
You know, again, we'd do it if we had to eat, right?

10:52.613 --> 10:59.261
So in formulating, so this more or less emerged out of the last novel then?

11:01.444 --> 11:03.767
Yes, it's all the time.

11:03.787 --> 11:10.074
In which I did, I had to track my memories.

11:10.095 --> 11:12.958
I still had the Catholic artists and the same thing again.

11:13.175 --> 11:18.821
I had an interest in myself.

11:18.841 --> 11:23.066
Another thing is, I had no better idea for a book than to do this.

11:23.086 --> 11:24.687
Which is a very important factor.

11:25.148 --> 11:36.280
And the third thing, the reciprocating course came from Christopher Buck, who in addition to writing books and reviews of human species, edited the magazine for four.

11:36.597 --> 11:38.880
called Forbes FYI.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.803
I've seen that, yeah.

11:41.823 --> 11:45.167
Most people I know don't see it because they don't subscribe to Forbes.

11:45.187 --> 11:49.232
It goes as a complimentary supplement to Forbes magazine.

11:50.873 --> 11:55.018
We got friendly because he wrote a very good review of closing times in New York.

11:55.038 --> 12:00.044
It was the first good review I've ever had in New York.

12:00.745 --> 12:03.448
I still haven't had one in the daily New York Times.

12:03.968 --> 12:05.590
That's funny.

12:05.690 --> 12:08.454
He wanted me to write a page, and he suggested this.

12:08.674 --> 12:10.516
He said, no, I couldn't refuse.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.859
I would go to Rome.

12:14.562 --> 12:16.884
He would send me to Rome for a week or so.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.306
I'd accept right off of that.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.428
And eat.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.510
Go to a few restaurants.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.253
How can you listen to turn that down?

12:23.273 --> 12:23.994
Yes, he did.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.478
And then write a page contest for being involved.

12:27.813 --> 12:36.727
My being in Rome was a service when I went to WrestleMania 1944, but I couldn't turn it down.

12:36.747 --> 12:50.089
I went and I wrote a piece, and since I'm not a food writer, nothing like a gourmet, I just like to eat, much of the piece had to do with my reflection and observations and memories.

12:50.770 --> 12:55.137
I gave him, I think he said 9,000 words, he could only use 3,000.

12:55.741 --> 13:09.780
There's got to be six miles of words about myself, more than the past in Rome, and the preceded Rome, which is Eastern Jewish cooking.

13:09.860 --> 13:14.526
And it ended with my coming back on a naval cruise ship, having great meals there.

13:15.046 --> 13:21.674
and getting my furlough to go back to Coney Island, eat the food I was accustomed to.

13:22.816 --> 13:31.908
Well, I had to say, 6,000 words left over without that, so I just picked up and then put myself on that Coney Island.

13:32.248 --> 13:34.130
So he ran 3,000, you kept the six?

13:34.271 --> 13:38.356
Well, I worked closely with most of the different chapters here.

13:38.576 --> 13:39.918
Oh, that's wonderful.

13:39.938 --> 13:42.141
That's a great story.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.023
As they say, with a writer, nothing is wasted.

13:44.003 --> 13:47.927
And that's important, isn't it?

13:48.428 --> 13:53.133
When I was in Spain last week, I went and saw four great libraries, you know.

13:53.453 --> 14:00.441
I went to the King's private library, goes back 400 years, blah, blah, blah.

14:00.501 --> 14:02.543
So Saturday, I'm not going to record this.

14:03.084 --> 14:06.467
I hate to transcribe myself talking.

14:06.487 --> 14:08.710
I had to transcribe myself blabbing away.

14:08.790 --> 14:10.872
All right, we're rolling again.

14:11.138 --> 14:26.665
I am enjoying getting these insights.

14:26.765 --> 14:31.273
Why is it that people always seem so surprised that you consider something happening in your best book?

14:31.253 --> 14:37.201
I think the ones who ask that question have the same theory.

14:37.221 --> 14:46.354
But whenever I ask that something happened, it's nodding.

14:46.995 --> 14:53.785
So there are people who have the same opinion.

14:53.984 --> 14:59.150
I may be reading it more recently.

14:59.310 --> 15:07.279
Everybody who reads will read, or try to read, every very young day.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.345
Something happens to everyone that they come to later.

15:12.365 --> 15:18.152
But over the years, there are always people.

15:18.622 --> 15:37.339
Do you think, you know, we talk about books appearing at certain points in your career.

15:38.011 --> 15:45.708
Catch-22, I think it only had been written at that point in your development as a writer.

15:45.728 --> 15:48.274
You couldn't have written that at the age of 60.

15:48.354 --> 15:49.597
I couldn't have written it.

15:49.617 --> 15:53.907
I couldn't, and I wouldn't shake it because the circumstances surround it.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.172
It's not the same.

15:56.641 --> 16:01.627
Vietnam, Vietnam came close to it.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.790
The Vietnam War really.

16:04.070 --> 16:06.193
National attitudes toward it.

16:07.074 --> 16:11.180
But since Vietnam, we've had no national attitudes toward it almost anything.

16:11.660 --> 16:21.012
And the only thing about Vietnam, it was because of the war in which almost every American was involved in one way or another, and with the post-war period.

16:21.464 --> 16:24.428
which is extremely troubling.

16:24.709 --> 16:28.955
And he's loved him to much of the country.

16:29.816 --> 16:31.759
Since then, no return.

16:31.799 --> 16:34.803
The civil rights struggle has disappeared.

16:34.823 --> 16:38.689
There's no more majority period.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.213
You do have a feminist movement.

16:41.233 --> 16:46.100
You have a conservative life.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.024
These movements that have anti-amortions,

16:49.375 --> 16:57.627
People feel very passionate about it, but most people outside that story.

16:58.288 --> 17:01.093
World War II was big, and the post-war period was big.

17:01.774 --> 17:13.932
I think also, though, that as a writer coming along, if you were to attempt a book that emerges from your World War II experiences today,

17:14.671 --> 17:17.575
It would be a totally different book.

17:17.595 --> 17:27.550
I also think that had I written a realistic book about World War II, it would be on the shelves in the library, maybe short, but very exciting.

17:27.650 --> 17:30.594
I know it's the confusion of the post-war world.

17:31.075 --> 17:43.193
And that goes up to 1961 because I was absorbing events even as I was doing that with the World War II.

17:43.173 --> 17:49.325
creating a book that would have application outside the world, which it has happened.

17:49.986 --> 17:54.515
It's everywhere, major, major.

17:54.535 --> 17:57.561
And I was still here for people.

17:57.581 --> 18:05.316
I'm near you, for all the shows, who tell me that they've met all these characters, even though I myself never have.

18:05.566 --> 18:21.825
But if they've been in the service, if they weren't conducting organizations, if they weren't for large corporations, they see people... It is interesting in this book, though, that you do suggest certain people from your life who influence the shaping of these characters.

18:21.845 --> 18:27.451
And people who don't write don't understand that, you know, an invented character is an invented character.

18:27.471 --> 18:35.100
You can say, well, it was this guy I knew, and his name was this, and so he's... I mean, obviously, you get an idea for a name, and you see qualities, and...

18:35.485 --> 18:50.777
uh it emerges from a lot of people that you know but it is very interesting that in this book you do give us some people and you say that these people would probably be shocked to find out that they were the models oh yeah the ones the hungry joe

18:51.247 --> 18:57.622
But the only one I saw after the war, his name is Joe Krenko, C-H-R-E-N-K-O.

18:59.707 --> 19:03.997
He recognized aspects of his personality and experiences in the book.

19:04.999 --> 19:09.610
I saw him after the book came out.

19:09.590 --> 19:14.315
I wonder, if I had not met him, whether he would have recognized himself.

19:15.076 --> 19:18.159
The name is Joe Gankover.

19:18.179 --> 19:30.372
Sometimes there's a little incident that might have been... Incidents and character issues at combining traits.

19:30.653 --> 19:36.679
Henry Jones, for instance, was a person when he brought up the New York edition of his collective works.

19:36.699 --> 19:38.601
He was writing these prefaces.

19:39.442 --> 19:48.162
And he used that as an opportunity, he was tempted to go in and fool around, you know, with the actual books that he'd written years before.

19:49.065 --> 19:53.836
Wordsworth was notorious for changing his poetry and for the worse.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.805
You know, and you find instances like this.

19:58.105 --> 20:05.175
You and the other, and I imagine, feel that completed work is completed work, and that speaks for a period of time you're developing it.

20:05.355 --> 20:05.635
Yeah.

20:05.655 --> 20:11.664
Would you ever be tempted, for instance, to go in and tinker with things that you've heard about?

20:11.684 --> 20:12.545
No.

20:12.665 --> 20:16.130
I guess that's what I was trying to add.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.673
Yeah, I don't normally read the works.

20:18.813 --> 20:22.739
I did read the works in time.

20:22.959 --> 20:23.380
Do you?

20:23.580 --> 20:27.285
Well, I'm retiring to the Lord just a little.

20:27.535 --> 20:32.901
I'm greatly impressed with the quality of my writing.

20:32.921 --> 20:35.264
I was just going to ask that question.

20:35.304 --> 20:37.286
Yeah, what do you think when you see something like that?

20:37.306 --> 20:38.848
I don't think I wrote it.

20:38.868 --> 20:39.229
Really?

20:39.349 --> 20:42.272
I see descriptions, I see phrases, I see images.

20:42.392 --> 20:45.736
And you say, that's pretty good.

20:45.816 --> 20:50.722
Which would produce a great effort at the time I wrote it.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.324
I'm a very slow writer.

20:52.344 --> 20:54.927
Forms of literary language don't come easily to me.

20:54.907 --> 21:01.399
When did I ever think of those words?

21:01.419 --> 21:02.942
When did I ever get that phrase?

21:02.962 --> 21:06.228
It sounds like evil and war is the scripture.

21:06.248 --> 21:10.496
Have you ever stopped to figure out where this stuff comes from?

21:10.556 --> 21:14.704
I mean, a number of writers, John Keegan, who's not a fiction writer,

21:15.224 --> 21:17.306
You know what he said when he was writing The Face of Battle?

21:18.367 --> 21:19.128
It's a great book.

21:19.769 --> 21:21.190
He said it was like entering a zone.

21:21.491 --> 21:24.594
Almost, it was like he was apart from himself.

21:24.814 --> 21:25.875
Do you ever feel that way?

21:25.935 --> 21:26.075
No.

21:26.196 --> 21:27.557
That things are just kind of coming.

21:27.857 --> 21:31.201
No, and I'm, again, I, I, I, I work in museums.

21:31.261 --> 21:34.665
There's always a pain in the ass, as some people say to me.

21:34.685 --> 21:35.445
It's neither.

21:35.465 --> 21:36.226
It's a struggle.

21:37.347 --> 21:41.091
The newspaper, I hope you get a page a day if I'm writing.

21:41.211 --> 21:42.733
A page a day that I can set.

21:43.253 --> 21:46.177
and then move on to the next page.

21:46.197 --> 21:48.180
So you like to have that page done, though?

21:48.200 --> 21:48.520
Oh, true.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.642
I mean, it's finished work.

21:50.022 --> 21:51.965
No, it's never finished.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.889
Especially since the word process came into my life.

21:55.289 --> 21:57.913
Each time, I add to what I do.

21:57.933 --> 21:59.314
I like pages of long hair.

21:59.535 --> 22:03.540
When I have 10 or 20 or 12 blocks, I go to the...

22:03.976 --> 22:07.142
the keyboard of the word processor to enter it.

22:07.262 --> 22:09.847
In entering, I re-write.

22:09.867 --> 22:12.191
Usually I kind of add it.

22:12.211 --> 22:18.964
But each time I add, I will re-read everything in that process.

22:19.703 --> 22:32.315
And then when I print it out, I'll read it, and make changes in pencil, and then empty the changes in the text and the word classes before I print it out again.

22:32.675 --> 22:35.138
Language is a struggle.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.960
It's like bathroom tiles.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.102
Remember the tiny bathroom tiles that used to be?

22:40.362 --> 22:43.405
You'd still see them in barbershops.

22:43.786 --> 22:46.268
So I put them in anything one at a time for me.

22:46.248 --> 22:52.638
And so the language, the images, the sentences, the paragraphs would come in with great effort.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.362
And once I'm past it, it's out of my mind.

22:55.723 --> 22:59.489
I could come back and see it after a period of years.

23:00.029 --> 23:02.193
And it makes you feel pretty good to see it, you know?

23:03.415 --> 23:08.863
The critics and all the readers, the people who love this book, didn't make a mistake.

23:09.164 --> 23:13.268
There must be something to have a title that you came up with.

23:13.829 --> 23:18.273
Absolutely be part of the language, to have its own connotation.

23:18.293 --> 23:26.261
And the title is one thing, and by now, because I'm going to be 75 years old, the book was published in 61, and it's out of 35 years.

23:26.662 --> 23:29.285
It started in 53.

23:29.425 --> 23:31.487
By now I can look back on it.

23:31.907 --> 23:34.290
Look back, I don't have to look back.

23:34.310 --> 23:38.614
Looking for the great amount of pride and satisfaction in having achieved that.

23:38.594 --> 23:40.897
I'm sorry?

23:41.679 --> 23:44.202
Did you finish the new book, Terry?

23:44.222 --> 23:45.204
Yes, I have.

23:46.205 --> 23:55.399
The last few paragraphs, just explain how pleased I am and how well things have gone for me.

23:55.419 --> 24:00.567
Both times the viewers didn't seem to like the amount of self-satisfaction at the last time.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.969
What do they want?

24:02.168 --> 24:05.795
I think they want me to be in New York in the restroom.

24:05.995 --> 24:06.135
Yeah.

24:06.636 --> 24:09.822
To be grum, to be grum, to be profound.

24:10.043 --> 24:18.278
I know your pal, Vonnegut, who I did an interview with last summer, he said, you know, I'm done.

24:18.379 --> 24:18.960
I'm quitting.

24:18.980 --> 24:20.282
I'm very happy with what I've done.

24:20.483 --> 24:22.827
I have things to say, and I think I've said it, and I've done it.

24:22.807 --> 24:24.832
And people said, geez, what?

24:25.434 --> 24:28.882
I don't, I'm seguing into the, you know.

24:28.982 --> 24:30.346
I have a different attitude.

24:30.366 --> 24:32.351
Okay, and that's what I was about to say.

24:32.371 --> 24:35.940
It could be, I'm done, but it will not be my intention.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.065
I want to keep writing, and...

24:38.045 --> 24:45.135
And for the same reason I think Vonnegut will keep writing, is that we have nothing better to do that we enjoy more.

24:45.395 --> 24:47.258
That's a great question.

24:47.378 --> 24:47.999
I love it.

24:48.179 --> 24:51.424
The publication processes can be agonizing.

24:51.785 --> 24:55.089
The editing process can be the conversation related.

24:55.570 --> 24:57.012
I've never had that, by the way.

24:57.533 --> 25:04.082
By the time I finish a book, usually I'm... I'll fight.

25:04.182 --> 25:06.145
I'll fight.

25:06.479 --> 25:14.733
And reviews are disappointing, and then the people who talk to you about reviews are disappointing.

25:14.753 --> 25:17.618
That's worse than the bad reviews.

25:17.638 --> 25:18.719
Do reviews bother you?

25:18.860 --> 25:25.451
I would rather not see them unless they're very good, but if they come to New York, then I see them.

25:25.471 --> 25:26.833
You have to see them.

25:27.657 --> 25:32.227
The publisher this time has told him that he's saying, he's a disgrace to everything.

25:32.368 --> 25:34.994
And when I was sent back, he'd give it to me.

25:35.114 --> 25:42.411
I saw the beginning yesterday in my picture, because I was actually inclined to hear.

25:42.952 --> 25:44.075
I mean, somebody said, you do.

25:44.095 --> 25:45.598
I say, Howard, is it a rave?

25:45.882 --> 25:50.788
And they say, well, I said, well, tell me about it.

25:51.068 --> 25:54.372
That can discuss a lot of people.

25:54.392 --> 25:54.732
I think so.

25:54.752 --> 26:01.060
Remember, you said, it could have been Philip Worsett's wife's Clare Boomer.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.842
He went into a state of clinical depression.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.525
I think John Updike gave him a bad review.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.068
I read it somewhere.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.191
It must have been in Clare Boomer's book.

26:10.211 --> 26:11.953
Yeah, it might have been.

26:12.113 --> 26:13.915
I interviewed her, believe it or not.

26:14.570 --> 26:20.239
But anyway, I have nothing better to respect my time.

26:20.259 --> 26:21.381
Do you have an idea for a novel?

26:21.401 --> 26:22.002
No, I don't.

26:22.062 --> 26:28.153
I never have had an idea for a novel, so somebody said there was a very good review in the L.A.

26:28.173 --> 26:29.855
Times with this book.

26:29.916 --> 26:31.919
That ends with this.

26:31.939 --> 26:35.385
I mentioned a sequel in the galleys.

26:35.765 --> 26:38.530
In the galleys, the joke is not obvious.

26:38.550 --> 26:39.852
It's not obvious that I'm joking.

26:40.253 --> 26:41.776
I hope not.

26:41.856 --> 26:59.325
I hope not because...

26:59.862 --> 27:07.657
It would be almost a synthetic clarification.

27:07.677 --> 27:15.412
I don't know what else I could write about in one life that would be worth writing, it would be interesting, it would be unusual.

27:15.473 --> 27:19.520
To talk about the breakup of my marriage would be just tried stuff.

27:19.601 --> 27:21.364
And whose business is that?

27:21.344 --> 27:30.063
If there's anything really as usual, I suppose, if it's the creation of a great novel, then maybe it's perfect.

27:31.125 --> 27:38.020
I'm saying that he doesn't want to talk about it.

27:38.253 --> 27:45.625
One reason is not particularly interesting.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.270
I'm thinking with more world experiences.

27:49.310 --> 27:51.895
Less high world experiences are not going to use it.

27:51.915 --> 27:53.918
And then you use the best of them already.

27:54.519 --> 27:56.221
Maybe I should have presented it.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.163
I'll read the book.

27:57.183 --> 28:02.712
I'll say, in a part of that, I wouldn't be able to repeat.

28:03.132 --> 28:06.117
But there was a... I gave her...

28:06.350 --> 28:30.957
I don't have anything to do to put in unless, you know, 75 years from now, if I live another 70 years, I hope to write another novel.

28:31.325 --> 28:35.150
So you think Vonnegut will probably come back?

28:36.111 --> 28:38.034
I think Vonnegut will write.

28:38.054 --> 28:40.517
He has no hobbies.

28:40.577 --> 28:42.540
I have no hobbies.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.923
He has no real distractions.

28:44.943 --> 28:46.025
He has a daughter.

28:46.045 --> 28:47.867
He's a daughter who is preoccupied.

28:48.308 --> 28:48.889
So I don't.

28:49.529 --> 28:54.516
If I have nothing to do with my time, I get very depressed.

28:54.536 --> 28:55.257
And you like to write?

28:55.608 --> 28:59.941
I like to write, yeah, and I like to write difficult books.

28:59.982 --> 29:05.800
The article, I did read to Christopher Barnaby, I did read it to three of them before, two of them after the row.

29:06.442 --> 29:07.525
They're different.

29:07.741 --> 29:10.746
and they'd take a week or two.

29:10.806 --> 29:12.248
But they're only diverging.

29:12.288 --> 29:15.834
If I had to do it regularly, I couldn't do it.

29:15.934 --> 29:19.039
I was run out of ideas, run out of music.

29:19.059 --> 29:22.083
Does the humor come naturally, and does it really have to work again?

29:22.103 --> 29:29.134
There are at least two parts of my personality, which I try to present now and then.

29:29.154 --> 29:34.643
There's the interior part, which can be moody, anxious, tense.

29:35.348 --> 29:39.773
I say, if I'm not working, there's nothing I want to do.

29:39.853 --> 29:44.379
I wake up in the morning, I can't think of anything I want to do.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.982
I can be very, very gloomy.

29:47.002 --> 29:55.793
The other thing is when I relate to people I like being with, I can keep talking and talking and laughing.

29:55.813 --> 29:58.376
I love the fascination for food though.

29:58.736 --> 30:00.158
That's my Achilles heel.

30:00.509 --> 30:03.672
But it made me close to Universal.

30:03.773 --> 30:11.181
Other people, in common, you know, I like to say that the world seems to be almost synonymous with being alive and enjoying life.

30:12.122 --> 30:18.549
And it's one of the great parties when you read of that poor guy Brady got shot when he was guarding Reagan.

30:18.909 --> 30:20.050
He lost his taste.

30:20.211 --> 30:21.732
He couldn't taste food anymore.

30:21.752 --> 30:22.233
Oh, Reagan?

30:22.813 --> 30:23.915
The guy, remember, Brady?

30:23.935 --> 30:24.255
Oh, yeah.

30:24.455 --> 30:28.384
Oh, Brady, yeah, he lost his taste.

30:28.584 --> 30:32.272
You can have it if you want.

30:32.312 --> 30:35.720
I want you to assign my book.

30:36.361 --> 30:37.223
What's your schedule?

30:37.243 --> 30:39.949
Are you planning out today?

30:39.929 --> 30:48.422
I'm going to give you my card.

30:49.584 --> 30:50.806
And you still have your book?

30:50.846 --> 30:52.769
Of course you have your book.

30:52.789 --> 30:54.471
Well, what I've done, you know that, huh?

30:54.491 --> 30:55.052
That's cool.

30:55.092 --> 30:55.713
You remember that.

30:55.733 --> 30:57.035
That's why you're here.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.018
But I've got 20 papers now.

30:58.998 --> 31:25.900

31:26.116 --> 31:29.563
I started doing this 1,000 authors ago, 20 years ago.

31:29.764 --> 31:30.705
I've done one a week.

31:30.725 --> 31:31.527
I haven't missed a week.

31:31.547 --> 31:33.932
You must have a big book and a big library.

31:33.952 --> 31:34.714
The house is filled.

31:35.135 --> 31:40.305
And I've got every book that you've done, signed, ascribed.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.614
Katie, what's that?

31:45.758 --> 31:49.462
Do you know what you might do?

31:51.664 --> 31:56.068
If you have the time, get in touch with Forbes F1.

31:56.168 --> 31:57.689
You're in the Forbes building.

31:57.970 --> 31:59.931
Ask if they can send you a copy.

31:59.951 --> 32:00.532
Yeah, I will.

32:00.632 --> 32:01.413
I'll do whatever.

32:01.433 --> 32:04.256
With the piece on your own.

32:04.476 --> 32:10.902
You want me to send you a copy?

32:10.942 --> 32:12.103
No, I have one copy.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.723
I mean, of the piece today, right?

32:14.743 --> 32:15.905
Oh, sure, sure.

32:16.826 --> 32:19.750
Well, they will get it.

32:19.890 --> 32:21.853
If you want to take the trouble, fine.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.055
I'm happy to.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.218
Sometimes they're four, four, five, six weeks behind.

32:25.338 --> 32:26.640
All right, send it to me.

32:26.660 --> 32:27.220
You got a P.O.

32:27.260 --> 32:28.662
box or something?

32:28.743 --> 32:29.524
68.

32:30.285 --> 32:32.327
Skim Hampton.

32:32.347 --> 32:33.048
S-K-I-M?

32:33.088 --> 32:34.210
Yeah, road.

32:34.477 --> 32:44.814
Would you like to see a copy of my book?

32:44.835 --> 32:47.820
If I send you a copy of my book?

32:47.920 --> 32:51.366
It's about book madness.

32:52.087 --> 32:56.214
I had a great chapter of the book beat, the guy who stole $20 million worth of books.

32:56.514 --> 33:00.501
And I went to his trial out in Iowa.

33:01.004 --> 33:02.486
And he stole the books because he loved them.

33:02.506 --> 33:04.448
That's what made him very interesting.

33:04.468 --> 33:05.910
You know, some people steal for greed.

33:05.930 --> 33:06.691
This guy stole.

33:07.953 --> 33:08.133
Uh-huh.

33:09.435 --> 33:09.595
Yeah.

33:09.635 --> 33:11.437
I had the great book cube stories.

33:11.477 --> 33:13.179
Bibliomania over 2,500 years.

33:13.299 --> 33:14.701
It's kind of fun.

33:14.781 --> 33:16.904
People who have killed for books.

33:16.944 --> 33:18.426
People who have been killed by books.

33:19.127 --> 33:20.849
They have great relations.

33:21.410 --> 33:25.695
This is fun.

33:26.401 --> 33:31.188
This is the fourth interview, so you say it.

33:31.268 --> 33:38.097
I still have all the notes, so I figure everything we've said before is stolen talent.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.701
It's kind of hard finding new things to talk about, you know.

33:41.462 --> 33:42.163
But I like this.

33:42.323 --> 33:45.287
There's a great bit of blood noise.

33:45.267 --> 33:49.534
Is that right?

33:49.875 --> 33:51.277
I never met him.

33:51.337 --> 33:55.003
You know, Christopher Lydon is very interesting.

33:55.023 --> 33:58.969
Have you ever been on his show at all?

33:59.170 --> 34:00.912
I think I'm going on his show.

34:00.933 --> 34:01.994
You're going there right now?

34:02.014 --> 34:02.395
Yeah, he's good.

34:02.455 --> 34:03.016
He's terrific.

34:03.136 --> 34:04.138
You're going on there right now?

34:04.158 --> 34:05.941
Oh, good, I'll listen to it on the way home.

34:06.001 --> 34:06.401
Terrific.

34:06.482 --> 34:08.785
Oh, that's great.

34:08.805 --> 34:11.970
Well, he's got a Henry James New York edition.

34:11.991 --> 34:12.912
I was on his show.

34:12.892 --> 34:15.059
And he says to me, what did you pay for yours?

34:15.240 --> 34:16.143
I said, you don't want to know.

34:16.283 --> 34:17.668
I paid $2,500 for his.

34:17.728 --> 34:19.956
And his is only fair.

34:20.076 --> 34:22.705
I got mine through the university.

34:22.765 --> 34:24.531
I was with somebody who had given it.

34:24.551 --> 34:25.956
I should take $1,500 on the tape.
