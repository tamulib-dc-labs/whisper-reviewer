WEBVTT

00:04.722 --> 00:07.245
home of John Laquette in California.

00:07.265 --> 00:10.069
Let me, before I go on.

00:10.109 --> 00:19.181
An adrenaline that begins in me when I'm searching for something or there's something out there that I have a yin for that it becomes fairly all-encompassing.

00:20.623 --> 00:25.630
Most of the stuff that I collect is not in any way unique.

00:26.511 --> 00:33.801
Most of it is not phenomenally rare because it is modern so there's still a lot of

00:34.220 --> 00:36.942
I would think a lot of examples of the work around.

00:37.403 --> 00:39.685
Do you have any inscribed things?

00:42.688 --> 00:42.948
Yes.

00:43.589 --> 00:44.149
Yes, I have.

00:44.329 --> 00:54.418
I guess a lot of the Samuel Beckett that I own was inscribed or signed specifically.

00:55.159 --> 01:00.104
A lot of it to this particular collection that I just acquired to Jack McGowan's daughter.

01:00.584 --> 01:01.645
Jack McGowan is an actor.

01:02.401 --> 01:06.226
who, when Beckett saw him, says he has the face of every character ever written.

01:06.246 --> 01:09.291
And he was one of the best interpreters of Beckett that ever lived.

01:09.311 --> 01:11.975
Well, those are great association copies as well.

01:11.995 --> 01:14.458
And a lot of these are to his daughter, Tara McGowan.

01:15.359 --> 01:27.717
When Jack died, the story goes that occasionally Beckett would produce an extremely limited edition of one of his works and much of the proceeds he would give to Jack's widow to help her along.

01:28.203 --> 01:34.570
and Tara was running around the theaters when they were working together, and so a lot of the books are inscribed to her.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.173
This is not an inconsiderable collection.

01:37.193 --> 01:39.315
This is a very important collection.

01:39.335 --> 01:42.619
I suppose there's, I guess, maybe about 800 or 900 titles in it.

01:42.639 --> 01:46.423
You acquired an 800 to 900 title collection.

01:46.443 --> 01:49.106
A lot of it is criticism.

01:49.126 --> 01:57.855
I would say about 300 or 400 of the books are criticisms of Beckett by the scholars that have studied it, Ruby Cone and John Fletcher,

01:57.987 --> 02:02.372
all the men that wrote about him and the absurdist movement altogether.

02:02.432 --> 02:11.942
So the fellow that I bought it from, although I don't know him personally, any reference in a book that was about Beckett, even though the book was not exclusively about Sam.

02:11.962 --> 02:14.064
Oh, yeah, that would make it like a B or C item.

02:14.084 --> 02:15.065
Yes, right.

02:15.245 --> 02:21.392
And some of it, again, some of it is books of Mexican poetry that Beckett himself translated for publication.

02:21.492 --> 02:24.275
This sounds like a pretty comprehensive collection.

02:24.295 --> 02:26.998
Now, this is interesting because when we chatted briefly on the phone,

02:28.497 --> 02:32.162
You mentioned that you first became a collector seven or eight years ago.

02:32.182 --> 02:41.715
You were an aspiring actor, apparently, and as you told it, you were doing Ham and Endgame, I guess.

02:42.256 --> 02:43.117
I'm telling the story.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.801
Maybe you can tell the story for me.

02:45.881 --> 02:57.357
I've read Beckett all my life, and at least from the time I was about 14, I think I was introduced to Beckett by a teacher that I had, a brother, actually, a Holy Cross brother.

02:57.573 --> 03:05.941
in New Orleans, who turned me on to, I think, Waiting for Godot, and fell in love with the work, so I've always read him.

03:06.922 --> 03:12.908
And when I had the opportunity to do the play Endgame, I was in a bookstore.

03:13.268 --> 03:14.629
It wasn't actually a bookstore.

03:14.690 --> 03:17.933
It sold seashells in Venice, California.

03:19.174 --> 03:22.217
But in the back, there was this little bookshelf with some titles on it.

03:23.318 --> 03:26.601
And one of them was this 16-volume

03:27.779 --> 03:37.694
collection of Grove Press put out in 1970 of Beckett's collected works and was called, although it was single volumes of all the books that they had up to that point of his.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.677
And there were two editions of it.

03:39.697 --> 03:49.092
There was the regular trade edition with covers and then a specially bound edition signed by Beckett.

03:49.112 --> 03:56.503
One volume of the 16 was signed, which was Godot, signed by me, of 200 copies, I think.

03:59.943 --> 04:01.965
like $400, a lot of money.

04:02.746 --> 04:06.931
So the other one was like $125, $150 for the 16 volumes unsigned.

04:07.692 --> 04:12.037
And I bit my tongue and paid this money for these books.

04:13.760 --> 04:26.194
And it gave me such a wonderful feeling of knowing that in one fell swoop I had gotten all of these books of his that were in a particular edition that I was going to be opening in the play the next couple of days.

04:26.234 --> 04:29.258
It just gave me this real feeling of fulfillment

04:30.200 --> 04:35.748
And shortly after that, I got this job that I'm still doing as of today, this television series.

04:36.810 --> 04:40.816
And so I thought, why not buy a few more of his books?

04:40.836 --> 04:44.362
At that point, at that moment, however, you were a collector.

04:44.382 --> 04:44.622
Yes.

04:44.923 --> 04:45.924
And did you realize that?

04:46.805 --> 04:57.642
I think that probably in the back of my mind, although I couldn't form it solidly, I thought to myself, this would be a nice thing to be able to do, to acquire

04:58.364 --> 05:13.874
first editions of the authors that I loved to read because at that time most of the stuff that I read as a teenager was no longer available once you bought a pulp paperback of Henry Miller or Samuel Beckett or Robinson Jeffers or T.S.

05:13.894 --> 05:15.317
Eliot, those guys that I liked to read.

05:18.182 --> 05:19.545
And so I would...

05:21.736 --> 05:31.168
go into bookstores and not really have any knowledge, and most bookstores were like Doubleday, or I didn't know where, if there were these actual stores that sold just these little first edition things.

05:32.109 --> 05:50.292
But slowly I became aware of a couple of stores in Los Angeles, and also just prior to 1982, I became aware of a writer, a California writer, named Charles Bukowski, who is, are you familiar with Bukowski?

05:50.660 --> 06:04.500
Okay, so I started reading him a few years prior to that and walked into, I accidentally, I think, walked into this little bookstore in Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood called Baroque Books, run by a man named Stadolsky, Red Stadolsky.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.382
We heard him mention this morning.

06:06.403 --> 06:06.783
Oh, you did?

06:07.845 --> 06:07.985
Yeah.

06:08.646 --> 06:14.815
And his store was replete with first edition Charles Bukowski, as well as Faulkner.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.258
He has a big Faulkner collection, Henry Miller.

06:17.542 --> 06:20.767
pictures of he and Miller on the wall together, and he and Bukowski on the wall together.

06:21.949 --> 06:30.782
And so I bought a couple of Charles Bukowski first editions, just the first trade editions, you know, they're 30 bucks, 25 bucks, 30 bucks, whatever they were.

06:30.822 --> 06:31.082
They are.

06:31.783 --> 06:34.487
And slowly, as I got more disposable income,

06:49.452 --> 07:19.189
but the idea of just owning these authors became more and more exciting to me so slowly I started going to book fairs around the country when I would be off working in a movie job I would find stores in the town getting information from Red I think by this time I had become aware of George Houlay and started hanging around his own shop Sibilsky Brooklyn Red I think is the full title of his nickname I'm quite sure

07:19.675 --> 07:25.304
I found a book by Robert Wilson called Modern Book Collecting that Red gave me.

07:25.825 --> 07:26.846
Good book, yeah.

07:26.926 --> 07:28.429
And Red is mentioned in it, actually.

07:28.649 --> 07:38.204
Vicariously, I think Red at one point found an old box of books in an old lady's house that he bought for eight dollars or something, and it was filled with first edition Hemingway's and stuff that she had had in her attic for years and years.

07:39.345 --> 07:40.407
I love to collect.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.232
And so I read Robert Wilson and thought, okay, who do you collect?

07:43.292 --> 07:47.438
If you're a collector, define what you do.

07:48.751 --> 08:06.840
But since my education, formally, had been rather uneventful, I didn't have a big backlog of knowledge of classical literature, except as an actor, the playwrights of ancient times in the 17th and 18th century, I really wasn't familiar with the literature that much, except that which I read out of my own curiosity.

08:07.641 --> 08:10.085
But as a kid, I'd always read modern books.

08:10.105 --> 08:15.754
I was always an avid reader, but I usually kept up with what was going on right then and there, particularly in the late 50s and early 60s,

08:17.118 --> 08:23.789
Hubert Selby was writing, and William Burroughs, and that whole era started, the whole B generation started, was really, I think, when I started reading seriously.

08:23.809 --> 08:25.432
Before that, it was mostly poetry, T.S.

08:25.472 --> 08:30.560
Eliot, Robinson Jeffers, Randall Carroll, Majorelle, I guess.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.845
Let me do this for you.

08:34.126 --> 08:34.827
Milk or sugar?

08:37.371 --> 08:37.712
No.

08:39.875 --> 08:40.476
Smells.

08:51.053 --> 09:00.503
I became aware of Ross Sipper.

09:03.866 --> 09:10.513
He started hanging out with Joe the Proviner occasionally.

09:11.114 --> 09:13.316
Joe the pro and the alcoholic.

09:17.421 --> 09:19.643
I just started very nitpicking

09:20.298 --> 09:23.983
Buying books that I had loved.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.366
Buying a first edition of A Clockwork Orange.

09:27.307 --> 09:29.410
Buying a first edition of The Collector by John Fowles.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.175
The black and the red, the two variant.

09:33.195 --> 09:35.818
Were you buying titles, authors, or both?

09:37.621 --> 09:42.868
I guess at the time I was buying titles, but authors who I had read.

09:42.888 --> 09:48.415
I didn't start buying other Burgess books until I thought, well, I've got this.

09:48.985 --> 09:51.187
Why not buy a couple of other books of his that I had read?

09:51.247 --> 09:55.492
Older, I mean, newer books, actually, Earthly Powers and Napoleon Symphonies.

09:57.554 --> 10:02.619
I then thought, well, if I've started this, why not try to get as a complete collection of each author as I can?

10:02.659 --> 10:09.486
And with Beckett, I had sort of hesitated with Beckett because of the cost involved.

10:09.866 --> 10:14.291
Much of Beckett's earlier stuff was relatively expensive.

10:14.311 --> 10:16.493
You're talking about in the early stages of the collecting.

10:16.593 --> 10:17.674
Right.

10:17.694 --> 10:18.435
When you're still

10:18.938 --> 10:21.100
what we call a struggling actor.

10:21.120 --> 10:32.333
Yeah, and the struggling wasn't so much anymore, but at the time, I thought the idea of spending $100 or $500 on a book, you know, to justify that, I would have to really think about it.

10:33.294 --> 10:39.100
And so when I was still, this guy is insane.

10:39.120 --> 10:48.270
You know, I was still buying, I guess the person I spent the most money on the earliest was Bukowski, because I started finding

10:49.077 --> 11:00.949
the very old, rare things, the little chapbooks and the little pamphlets of his that were put out in the 60s in New Orleans of the Jean Press and the very early stuff that John Martin had done with him.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.833
And that sort of brought me off on a tangent of Black Sparrow.

11:04.873 --> 11:14.082
I started buying other Black Sparrow writers, John Fonte because of Bukowski, and I love that writing, I love that style, that sort of, you know, man by himself.

11:14.102 --> 11:15.003
You didn't even get into it.

11:15.023 --> 11:16.384
I mean, you really became

11:17.478 --> 11:47.417
it became an education too it became a wonderful education in the area of book collecting unto itself much less particular authors i mean just the education of uh getting myself familiar with how a publisher designates a first edition you know to learn the uh the points of a book and it became a wonderful uh obsession to get as conversant with it as possible so i could pick up a book and really know something about it and how early on did you did you realize how important say condition is that's

11:47.667 --> 12:14.670
almost immediately i think the guys that i dealt with i mean they i think they uh particularly ralph sipper um i think um instilled that a great deal because ralph always and maurice neville as well i think had always martin had um emphasized condition and i and a lot of times their books were you know maybe half again as much as any other copy that i had come across in the catalog and when asked why they would say well look at the book because

12:15.224 --> 12:18.247
Like the clockwork orange I have, the spine is perfect.

12:18.367 --> 12:18.967
There's no fading.

12:19.087 --> 12:20.809
The orange letters are there.

12:21.349 --> 12:26.894
I just, not too long ago, bought a first edition of a streetcar named Desire.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.836
I don't collect Williams, but I bought it because it was published the year I was born.

12:29.896 --> 12:32.619
And I used to ride that streetcar when I was a kid.

12:32.639 --> 12:34.540
So it had that.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.904
Yeah, we started collecting Tennessee Williams when we found a perfect copy.

12:38.924 --> 12:39.885
It was on a glass one.

12:39.905 --> 12:41.286
It was gorgeous.

12:41.306 --> 12:44.809
And then I have a perfect copy of a street check.

12:46.409 --> 12:48.672
Did you just find that you came from it?

12:48.692 --> 12:49.433
I hadn't been looking for it.

12:49.453 --> 12:50.454
I just happened to be up at Ralph's.

12:50.755 --> 12:51.636
Ralph had it, yeah.

12:51.836 --> 12:54.760
Does this one have a couple of holes in the back?

12:55.000 --> 13:01.209
He had one in his catalog for the longest time in very, very fine condition, but it has a few holes in it.

13:01.409 --> 13:02.250
I don't think so.

13:02.290 --> 13:03.832
I'll show it to you.

13:03.872 --> 13:05.074
I saw that in one of the books.

13:05.094 --> 13:06.516
It's terrific.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.999
That's a tough dust jacket because of that purple.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.060
Right, exactly.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.904
And fades.

13:12.964 --> 13:15.808
And so as I became more confident

13:16.733 --> 13:37.284
and knowing that I was doing something that I thought that at any point quite survival instinct, I suppose, or with mercenary feelings that if I ever had to jump out of it for any particular reason, that the stuff I was buying I could turn around and sell and know that at least I wouldn't have lost any money on it, you know.

13:37.324 --> 13:39.247
So I became a little bolder in the stuff that I would buy.

13:40.148 --> 13:43.213
Well, did you kind of use the thought that it

13:43.531 --> 13:46.557
Well, it's an investment as a rationalization.

13:46.757 --> 13:47.699
Sure.

13:47.719 --> 13:49.783
My wife slaps me down when I say that.

13:49.803 --> 13:52.508
She says, well, all right, let me tell you something.

13:52.528 --> 13:55.834
She said, what happens with an investment is that you get money back from it.

13:56.595 --> 13:58.379
So go sell them and get money back from them.

13:58.579 --> 13:59.821
If they're worth more now, fine.

13:59.841 --> 14:02.907
If they're an investment, you put money in the bank and they give you interest.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.844
Again, does your wife share, your wife doesn't share the passion of that?

14:06.864 --> 14:14.914
Not the passion, no, but I think she's learned to accept it truly, and I've turned her on to a couple of authors that she loves, so I then started buying books of theirs for her.

14:15.915 --> 14:27.649
Ann Tyler, for one, and Alice Munro, and Alan Gilchrist, I think is a Northern English writer, and my wife is from Newcastle upon Tyne in the very North of England.

14:28.490 --> 14:30.953
And she appreciates the book, she just doesn't have that.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.664
She has quite the passion that I do for it.

14:33.825 --> 14:38.433
And that was a hard one to start, actually.

14:38.453 --> 14:43.161
I was surprised at how fast those books, number one, disappeared, and how quickly they escalated in price.

14:43.361 --> 14:49.693
If morning ever comes, for instance, I was amazed that it was a $400 or $500 book that I bought.

14:51.275 --> 14:52.698
A clock winder.

14:53.219 --> 14:54.481
Tin can alley life.

14:54.501 --> 14:55.303
Tin can something.

14:55.323 --> 14:56.164
That's the script.

14:56.785 --> 15:00.590
If Morning Ever Comes, actually, it's not even our toughest title, as tough as it is.

15:00.610 --> 15:03.834
I think the fourth one, for some reason, is almost impossible.

15:03.954 --> 15:04.675
That's the last one.

15:04.955 --> 15:07.298
I think I got it from Ralph.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.421
I think I have them all.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.463
I think I do have one.

15:13.085 --> 15:17.370
So as time went on, I would just buy, you know, with a lot of, I bought a lot of Bukowski.

15:18.452 --> 15:22.757
Every new thing that came out, I would get the most limited edition of it I could find, usually then, in the old days.

15:22.977 --> 15:25.240
The old days, five years ago, even sort of hand painting some

15:25.777 --> 15:28.520
on the fly leaf on the inside.

15:28.921 --> 15:31.163
Now it's just prints, I guess, that they do.

15:32.265 --> 15:50.126
And a situation happened that was, my wife helped orchestrate a practical joke against me for television, a series that was on television for a while, posted by Dick Clark, where they would take actors and put them in weird situations and try to surprise them.

15:51.308 --> 15:55.733
And this fake book auction was set up for me to be part of

15:56.067 --> 15:56.888
I fell for it.

15:56.948 --> 15:59.873
Oh, I'd love to see that.

15:59.973 --> 16:00.694
When was that then?

16:01.054 --> 16:01.515
Oh, God.

16:02.236 --> 16:03.057
Four or five years ago.

16:04.099 --> 16:08.425
I got an invitation in the mail to a book auction.

16:09.086 --> 16:10.308
My wife said nothing about it.

16:10.388 --> 16:11.991
I looked at it and I thought, this might be fun.

16:12.351 --> 16:13.453
And I just put it on my dresser.

16:13.493 --> 16:14.635
She never pushed it or anything.

16:14.675 --> 16:17.619
And so the Thursday came around two days before it was to happen.

16:17.659 --> 16:18.781
I said, I think I want to go to this.

16:18.801 --> 16:19.081
Do you care?

16:19.402 --> 16:20.303
She said, no, I'll go with you.

16:20.907 --> 16:23.993
At an antique store in Hollywood, Charles and Charles, it was called.

16:25.175 --> 16:28.881
We got there, walked through the whole antique store, all very legit.

16:28.901 --> 16:29.843
We got to this room.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.307
My wife said, I'm going to go to the toilet, excuse me.

16:32.788 --> 16:37.096
They were auctioning off paintings in the room while I was standing there watching them.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.861
There was a table full of books.

16:40.803 --> 17:06.422
my wife came back and i was just about to walk over to the table to examine some of the books when they started the auction so i didn't have a chance to which was their plan because the books were all from either red or ralph sipper and i noticed that and maybe several of the auctioneers now several of the people in the auction all had wireless on my wife went to the bathroom in order to get a microphone on her so the

17:06.655 --> 17:27.077
object of the joke was for them to auction off books that they knew i owned at a fraction of their cost but i'm not stupid i started bidding on the books when they were at five dollars a book i knew was eighty dollars and when it got to 80 or 85 and if anybody a bit above that i would just stop because i figured well i'm not gonna pay any more than i know what it's worth

17:27.462 --> 17:28.684
So they couldn't get me on that.

17:28.724 --> 17:30.626
So what they did went to the other extreme.

17:30.686 --> 17:31.988
Books that I knew were worth $100.

17:32.048 --> 17:34.051
People started bidding $1,000 to $2,000 for them.

17:34.752 --> 17:35.313
What did I think?

17:35.333 --> 17:36.234
What was going through your money?

17:36.254 --> 17:40.319
I had to believe a lot of it because I turned to Elizabeth and I go, what the shit?

17:40.339 --> 17:43.243
I have no goddamn idea what they're doing.

17:44.465 --> 17:47.329
And finally they pulled the rug from under me.

17:47.349 --> 17:49.031
They walked over to me with a book and gave it to me.

17:49.051 --> 17:51.955
And I looked up and then realized I saw these mirrors on the wall.

17:51.975 --> 17:54.178
And when I really stared at them, I could see the lens behind them.

17:55.593 --> 17:57.715
But it was great for two reasons.

17:58.076 --> 18:02.661
Ralph gave me a book, write a couple of books, and I was still a very young pup of a collector.

18:03.302 --> 18:11.731
So I got a couple of free titles, and Bukowski saw the broadcast and wrote me a letter and inscribed a few books to me personally, which was great.

18:12.172 --> 18:13.833
When did Dick Clark did this?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.136
I might see if I can get it.

18:16.156 --> 18:17.818
I would think there's a tape of it sitting around somewhere.

18:17.878 --> 18:19.119
What is it called?

18:19.139 --> 18:22.343
Bloopers and Practical Jokes, I think was the name of the series.

18:23.285 --> 18:24.547
They really were very smart.

18:24.887 --> 18:30.694
When you really think about them, it shows you how... I used to say I could never be fooled by that because I'd see friends of mine on that show.

18:31.255 --> 18:33.538
And I thought that was so hokey.

18:33.558 --> 18:34.699
You get suckered all the way, though.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.303
With books, I got suckered real easy.

18:37.323 --> 18:40.126
It shows you when a man has greed, he'll believe anything.

18:40.967 --> 18:45.333
You see, one of the themes I'm pursuing in this book is motivation.

18:45.353 --> 18:48.897
What motivates the book collective.

18:48.917 --> 18:50.980
And there are some delightful stories going back

18:51.652 --> 19:01.444
about 180 years, and the famous hoax, and that's why I've got to get the story, because it's the famous, the Defortis Biblio hoax, remember I explained that to you?

19:01.865 --> 19:06.451
It's Frenchman, not an 8% tape, if you're interested in this story.

19:07.031 --> 19:13.099
Anyway, the Defortis Biblio hoax is kind of a wonderful story.

19:13.259 --> 19:19.607
But it did appeal to the same, I mean, it was an instance, it appealed to the same instinct.

19:19.968 --> 19:21.169
Particularly if you think there's something that

19:21.385 --> 19:47.950
I think what you were saying, one of the things that does give a feeling in me is that, I guess number one, the rarity of it, of a particular book, particularly if it's been, I think the thing that turns me on the most is, and it usually has to be signed copies, is the fact that the author had possession of it, for a moment anyway.

19:48.318 --> 19:51.663
You know, except those books like the late Fonte stuff that Black Sparrow did.

19:51.703 --> 19:54.847
I mean, he would sign black flyleaves, and they would just... Sure.

19:54.867 --> 20:01.556
Nevertheless, it's handled, and it's the first... I guess the first edition brings us closer to the creative process.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.378
I suppose it does.

20:02.478 --> 20:02.698
Yeah.

20:03.599 --> 20:09.087
Because there's no explanation for why people would spend, you know, the money that they do for printed books.

20:09.187 --> 20:11.170
It's not like it's a manuscript.

20:11.330 --> 20:12.732
It's a printed book.

20:12.752 --> 20:16.317
But if it's been handled, it's been signed, and that's why, inevitably,

20:16.803 --> 20:19.787
Now, do you have any manuscript material about it?

20:19.807 --> 20:20.588
Yes, not much.

20:21.450 --> 20:21.790
Not much.

20:21.810 --> 20:23.252
I mean, certainly not handwritten manuscripts.

20:23.272 --> 20:29.681
I mean, I've got some poems by Bukowski, typewritten poems, stuff like that, but not manuscript.

20:29.941 --> 20:31.504
Like written in longhand?

20:31.684 --> 20:32.205
No.

20:32.485 --> 20:38.874
Inevitably, I think the collecting with the means probably goes to manuscript.

20:38.934 --> 20:39.495
I would think so.

20:39.515 --> 20:42.319
I have a friend that collects Hugo and Dickens.

20:42.940 --> 20:43.941
Well, that's a strange stuff.

20:44.377 --> 20:44.998
Very amazing.

20:45.018 --> 20:49.285
But he mostly confined himself to letters, I think, partially because of the finances.

20:49.445 --> 20:53.331
Oh, it's probably... This is Nick.

20:53.511 --> 20:55.154
Nick?

20:55.174 --> 21:00.803
Guy grew up with me in New Orleans, and he still doesn't even get close to us spelling my name correctly.

21:00.883 --> 21:03.046
L-A-R-O-C-A-T-E.

21:03.647 --> 21:05.530
Oh, that's terrible.

21:05.550 --> 21:06.351
Laro Cat.

21:06.992 --> 21:08.815
I had one come from the other, Rick Bezos.

21:15.511 --> 21:18.975
That's one of my works for Virgin and Charisma.

21:19.175 --> 21:23.039
And I bought him dinner not too long ago, and he said he'd send me a little care package.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.163
People always sending me music.

21:27.224 --> 21:30.988
Jazz, mostly, I think is from the Virgin label.

21:31.008 --> 21:31.309
Anyway.

21:31.329 --> 21:37.235
When we chatted on the phone, you mentioned that you were going way back to New Orleans as a kid.

21:37.936 --> 21:41.140
You said that your mother used to put every comic book every day.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.303
Well, she worked at downtown New Orleans at a clothing store.

21:45.110 --> 21:49.995
And I was an only child, and so I would get home from school.

21:50.096 --> 21:51.137
We lived with my grandparents.

21:52.538 --> 21:54.140
And I would do my homework and stuff.

21:54.160 --> 21:54.961
She'd be home about 6.

21:56.122 --> 22:01.508
At about 5.30, I'd go outside and wait for her on the step to come home on the bus and walk down the block.

22:01.909 --> 22:03.110
And she always bought me two comic books.

22:05.973 --> 22:14.543
And it was like Christmas every day to me, the idea of having these books to be able to then go into my room.

22:15.316 --> 22:21.886
I go in the backyard of my house and sit and get lost in Superman or Thor, the Thunder God, or whoever it was.

22:22.687 --> 22:35.948
There was something so nurturing about those comic books that I wondered, you know, I think it had something to do with my pleasure in holding and possessing books today.

22:36.569 --> 22:40.034
When there's lots of books around me, I just feel safe.

22:40.334 --> 22:41.376
I feel secure.

22:41.676 --> 22:42.117
I feel...

22:42.907 --> 22:47.013
in the company of others, for some reason, even when I'm sitting in my study all alone.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.896
There's just something about having the books around.

22:49.917 --> 22:51.439
And I read most of the stuff that I buy.

22:51.459 --> 22:53.581
I mean, I read all the stuff that I buy eventually.

22:53.822 --> 22:54.863
And these editions?

22:55.865 --> 22:56.546
Yes, usually.

22:56.566 --> 23:00.571
I mean, I'll fall asleep with a sign, limited Beckett in my lap.

23:00.851 --> 23:03.976
That's very courageous.

23:04.256 --> 23:10.905
Well, most of the stuff, unfortunately, particularly with Beckett, it's kind of hard to find some of it in any other way.

23:12.404 --> 23:21.515
The real modern office that I buy, I usually don't buy trade editions anymore unless I'll go to the store and buy the new Richard Ford that comes out of the new Barry Hanna just to have that trade edition, and that's usually what I'll read.

23:23.358 --> 23:29.926
But a lot of it is the only form that I own it in, so if I want to read it, I have to read it down.

23:29.946 --> 23:32.449
There just wouldn't be room for having it all.

23:33.210 --> 23:37.315
I'm going to have paperback copies of everything in order to be able to... A question, and I guess you've kind of...

23:37.953 --> 23:43.880
partially answered it, is how do you enjoy your collection?

23:43.900 --> 23:47.345
For so many collectors, it's really the hunt and it's the acquisition.

23:47.605 --> 23:50.969
It's almost like chasing a woman for many people.

23:51.210 --> 23:54.013
Once a conquest is made, they lose.

23:54.173 --> 23:57.237
I must say that I'm not into the hunt, I don't suppose very much.

23:57.678 --> 24:00.101
The most I've ever hunted for a book was not for me, but for a friend.

24:00.121 --> 24:04.967
A friend of mine was who I owed a lot to my success.

24:07.150 --> 24:07.470
Loved

24:07.653 --> 24:11.717
Harper Lee and thought that To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the best books he'd ever read in his life.

24:11.737 --> 24:14.721
And so I hunted for about four or five months to find the first edition of that.

24:14.741 --> 24:18.145
I could find it on corrected proof, but I couldn't find the first trade.

24:18.705 --> 24:21.388
And finally did, and bought it for him.

24:21.408 --> 24:24.692
That's also got a photograph by Tennessee Williams on the desk jacket.

24:24.712 --> 24:27.855
And I think it might even have Truman Capote might have been.

24:27.875 --> 24:28.496
That's nice.

24:28.536 --> 24:29.437
There were cousins.

24:30.018 --> 24:36.765
But there's even a small rumor around that he was living with Harper Lee when she wrote it, and that some of it's him.

24:37.015 --> 24:41.642
But what's really great about collecting Harper Lee is that you have that and you have the whole oeuvre.

24:41.662 --> 24:42.423
That's exactly right.

24:42.763 --> 24:43.004
Right.

24:43.044 --> 24:46.769
And it's like Billy Brammer, and I've got three copies of The Gay Place.

24:47.290 --> 24:49.473
So I'm just absolutely complete.

24:49.573 --> 24:55.903
A lot of Mitchell's, you know, one author, one book author.

24:56.263 --> 25:02.152
But anyway, you enjoy them by, it's more than... Oh, yeah, I enjoy... The possession is really the first step.

25:02.172 --> 25:03.213
Yeah, for me it is.

25:03.474 --> 25:04.255
It's the...

25:04.927 --> 25:09.332
The enjoyment of the work, number one, if it's a great novel.

25:09.892 --> 25:26.591
There's a lot of Anthony Burgess that I don't necessarily enjoy reading as much as I do others of his, but the idea of watching a man's work over years and years and years is really what part of the experience is for me.

25:28.072 --> 25:30.495
I guess being able to look at, particularly with limited books,

25:31.893 --> 25:36.678
The production, the book itself, is really very enthralling to me, though.

25:37.519 --> 25:41.023
It's interesting to me that the first author you really collected is Beckett.

25:41.043 --> 25:51.414
And it is interesting because, as an actor, you were taking the product of his creative imagination, and you were giving life to it on the stage.

25:52.895 --> 25:59.082
And the next step, this is just coming to me now, so it's formulated in a different way.

26:00.226 --> 26:06.115
You were taking his creative work and giving it life, and maybe the next step was to own the first edition.

26:06.356 --> 26:10.282
It's interesting to me that this would be the first writer that you would collect.

26:10.302 --> 26:21.640
Well, I suppose that he straddled a line between playwright and author so incredibly for me that it was both the actor and the reader in me, collecting him.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.124
I don't collect many playwrights.

26:24.678 --> 26:53.335
i don't find myself a lucky player as well harold pinter i have a lot of first editions but it's interesting to me that you do not collect tennessee women's being from new orleans and where he did write wonderful short stories poetry yeah i guess that deep down i was never really a great fan of tennessee wings i suppose i mean because it was so close to who i was that i didn't aware i was in many ways that i didn't mean to who you were i mean well just being a southerner being you know part of that whole sort of uh

26:55.441 --> 26:57.143
elegant decay of the South.

26:58.644 --> 27:06.432
It didn't spur my imagination as much as this strange man walking around changing pebbles from one pocket to another in an Irish landscape.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.555
Would you describe yourself as an obsessive kind of person?

27:09.575 --> 27:10.056
Absolutely.

27:12.258 --> 27:16.983
And I guess this is one really productive way to channel... I hope it is.

27:17.323 --> 27:24.891
I find that it too puts strains on... I think any obsessive behavior will put a strain on relationships.

27:25.732 --> 27:33.960
And I think, you know, when books upon books upon books arrive at this house sometimes, there's a strain put on the relationship.

27:34.681 --> 27:38.244
But you said that you aren't really, the hunt doesn't turn you on.

27:38.785 --> 27:40.146
I mean, it doesn't really excite you.

27:40.767 --> 27:41.247
I don't think.

27:41.267 --> 27:45.111
I mean, I've not had, I guess maybe also I've not had anything I've wanted so badly and couldn't find.

27:45.151 --> 27:47.934
And I've gone out, really gone out to get it.

27:48.014 --> 27:54.000
You know, like I told Ralph, I said, listen, I need a copy of Fizzles, I mean, with Jasper Johns, you know, back in Jasper Johns' books.

27:57.878 --> 27:58.399
planes.

28:00.080 --> 28:05.607
Looking for it, it's possible because I don't want to have to come up with a tab for it when I finally do find it.

28:07.228 --> 28:10.292
It is daunting at some point where you've been looking for something.

28:11.173 --> 28:19.402
And let's say it's the one title that you don't have, and all of a sudden somebody has it and it's, you know, $1,500.

28:19.642 --> 28:24.668
You have to make the decision, well, I needed to fill out the author and, you know, you buy it.

28:25.068 --> 28:26.670
In fact, Ralph has a book for me to

28:26.920 --> 28:30.583
I have all of Arthur Miller except the first title, and they just wrote me a note.

28:30.603 --> 28:35.668
We have a gorgeous copy of this book, and it's X amount of dollars.

28:35.688 --> 28:37.990
I said, well, I'll pick it up when I go.

28:38.230 --> 28:39.491
We're going up there Wednesday.

28:39.692 --> 28:41.733
Don't go ahead.

28:41.754 --> 28:47.138
Of course, I've seen it all upstairs, and I'm really... No, a lot of the books in my room come from his show.

28:47.238 --> 28:56.607
I have to say that as far as quality goes, there's nobody that can touch Professor McBride for the quality of the book that he sells.

28:56.958 --> 28:59.801
Yeah, he definitely has high standards.

28:59.821 --> 29:09.352
There's one collector that I interviewed, a guy in New York, who says that he used to be a very heavy gambler.

29:09.372 --> 29:13.657
He used to really play at the Baccarat cables and the craft cables.

29:14.779 --> 29:26.492
And when he became really active as a book collector, he also collects furniture in our years, two rooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art named for him, that he

29:26.995 --> 29:31.620
He lost all interest, and he said he'd never been back to a casino.

29:32.041 --> 29:32.822
He has been.

29:32.842 --> 29:35.785
But going to the auction, he said, gives me that kick.

29:35.805 --> 29:37.427
He was flying at auction.

29:37.447 --> 29:42.492
And the excitement, I mean, I saw him spend $2 million for the four printed Shakespeare.

29:42.512 --> 29:43.554
He got the guidance.

29:43.614 --> 29:46.197
This is Richard Manny in New York.

29:46.217 --> 29:50.762
And, you know, that takes a modicum of courage, I would say.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.446
And they were going up for $50,000 props.

29:55.387 --> 29:56.428
The advances were...

29:58.062 --> 30:22.652
yeah it's pretty good for printed books we're not talking about anything manuscript here and they weren't even the original bindings but they wonderful copies and he wanted them and it is that you know it is that i mean i'm not in that kind of league at all i don't know if i'd ever i don't know if i'd ever i guess i would i guess i would come in if i ever got really really situated to where there was

30:23.645 --> 30:30.456
I think with that kind of collecting, though, there comes a point where unless you're fabulously wealthy, where you've got to look at turnover.

30:30.496 --> 30:39.009
At some point, you've got to look at being able to get some of that money back and use it again to buy something else, unless you're like H. Bradley Martin, and this fellow seems like he may have unlimited sources.

30:40.031 --> 30:47.543
In that case, I'm sure I would... I don't know if I would expand my area, though, because I don't...

30:48.991 --> 31:18.289
modern books unless i started just starting to this guy after a lot of the very rare inscribed folders that are floating out there right now oh this maureen neville you mentioned supposedly has a hemingway collection that is uh awesome i've never seen it are you familiar with with the collection though yeah there's a very interesting story about how he became a collective i mean he walked in and this is the story i've heard he walked into joseph the provider i mean how he became a dealer uh well

31:18.623 --> 31:23.789
As I understand, it had this collection, this wonderful collection of Feminine's stuff.

31:23.809 --> 31:25.771
And the guy says, how much?

31:25.791 --> 31:26.973
And he quoted him a price.

31:26.993 --> 31:28.354
I said, well, how much if I'm a dealer?

31:29.035 --> 31:30.076
He quoted him another price.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.859
He said, fine, I'm a dealer.

31:31.879 --> 31:34.321
And bought it, and in fact, became a dealer.

31:34.442 --> 31:35.263
This is the story.

31:35.303 --> 31:38.587
I heard the story, but I didn't hear it attributed to Joe the Pro.

31:38.607 --> 31:44.594
I thought it was a story in Los Angeles that that occurred, either heritage or one of the old.

31:44.814 --> 31:46.656
My understanding now,

31:47.294 --> 31:49.123
is that it was well.

31:49.666 --> 31:52.781
But again, I've got a second thread at hand.

31:53.444 --> 31:56.157
And the story's made around, so it's not like I'm...

31:57.419 --> 31:59.301
say anything?

31:59.341 --> 32:01.604
Oh, no, no, the story has it definitely.

32:01.624 --> 32:02.265
I've read the story.

32:02.285 --> 32:04.949
It was in maybe a year or so ago.

32:04.989 --> 32:08.714
There was a story of Maury in LA Magazine or someplace.

32:08.734 --> 32:10.576
Is it always heritage?

32:10.716 --> 32:14.541
Well, you know, it seems to me it wasn't Ralph.

32:14.561 --> 32:15.542
It seems to me I'd have remembered.

32:15.562 --> 32:19.447
I would definitely know if it was Ralph, but I may be totally wrong on that.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.250
It's a wonderful story.

32:21.270 --> 32:24.854
Do you have any questions, Card?

32:26.797 --> 32:26.937
She's

32:27.473 --> 32:28.895
extremely helpful.

32:29.395 --> 32:32.039
How about any other collectors?

32:32.119 --> 32:37.125
Is this the kind of endeavor that many actors do?

32:37.205 --> 32:37.866
Not that I know of.

32:37.886 --> 32:39.748
Are you kind of like a long-ranger out here, do you think?

32:39.928 --> 32:40.850
No, I don't think I am.

32:40.890 --> 32:47.898
No, because certainly there's... MacDonald Carey was a very big collector for many, many years, the actor.

32:49.080 --> 32:57.430
Had great big collections of, I think, Hemingway and Miller and Steinbeck and a lot of poetry.

32:58.675 --> 33:09.404
I, by the fact, recently was contacted by a fellow, a producer-actor in town, a fellow named Tony Bill, who produced The Sting and was a major producer in this town.

33:11.025 --> 33:14.508
And he just wanted to get together because he's bought books all of his life and didn't know he was a collector.

33:16.130 --> 33:20.574
But supposedly has, like, the best collection on pre-1930 aviation.

33:20.594 --> 33:28.260
And that and something else, airplanes and

33:29.877 --> 33:33.661
Aviation and something else.

33:33.681 --> 33:34.923
I don't remember the other subject.

33:35.323 --> 33:37.626
But we got together for lunch and we just kind of talked about it.

33:38.607 --> 33:40.309
Because he had never really talked to any other collectors.

33:40.329 --> 33:43.793
He had just been sort of going about his way buying these books around the country.

33:45.295 --> 33:46.497
But he's an obsessive dude, too.

33:46.597 --> 33:49.520
So it definitely lends to an obsessive personality.

33:51.502 --> 33:57.049
Particularly with the willingness to sit and peruse endless catalogs.

33:57.653 --> 33:58.294
And enjoy them.

33:58.654 --> 33:59.194
Yeah, I love them.

33:59.215 --> 34:00.155
I love reading catalogs.

34:00.175 --> 34:00.556
I love them.

34:00.576 --> 34:02.798
And I keep every one of them, too, which my wife cannot understand.

34:02.838 --> 34:04.680
So you didn't buy anything from it.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.862
Why are you keeping the catalog?

34:06.922 --> 34:08.243
We have crazy money now.

34:09.585 --> 34:12.828
They're all over the place.

34:12.848 --> 34:14.890
I love auction catalogs.

34:15.030 --> 34:19.074
This is a new collection of mine since I started the research for this book.

34:19.094 --> 34:25.500
It's buying really scarce, like the whole catalog from 1911, 1911.

34:25.733 --> 34:29.298
Jerome Kern was a tremendous collector.

34:29.318 --> 34:37.788
It had his sale in 1929, basically marked the end of the golden age of American collectors, the great crash came, but through the catalog.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.312
I just got the Streeter.

34:40.332 --> 34:44.417
I got a Brantley Martin Streeter catalog, and I bought three lots of the Brantley Martin.

34:44.437 --> 34:44.697
Oh, you did?

34:44.837 --> 34:45.839
Yeah.

34:45.859 --> 34:47.481
The American or the English?

34:47.501 --> 34:48.142
The American.

34:48.162 --> 34:52.387
I bought the Streeter catalog, seven volumes, and it was BAL, which you must get.

34:52.407 --> 34:54.610
Of course, you're modern, so you really wouldn't need BAL.

34:54.910 --> 35:03.401
You know, the bibliography of American literature, Jacob Blank, but it's up to 18, so you really collect after that, so it wouldn't help.

35:03.421 --> 35:07.767
The oldest author, I guess, is Knut Hamsun, you know, and just the late stuff.

35:07.807 --> 35:14.455
So you don't really restrict yourself to American, either, obviously, starting with Beckett.

35:14.796 --> 35:18.741
I guess it's mostly American and British, I guess it's mostly, though.

35:20.375 --> 35:31.588
Partially, I suppose, because I don't speak a foreign language, and the idea of having just the first American of something, if it were South American or French.

35:33.230 --> 35:42.480
I keep having this goal to learn, at some point before I die, how to at least read French so I can read Beckett and the original, many of them.

35:42.500 --> 35:47.025
William Blake learned tagging just so he could illustrate the Divine Comedy.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.588
He taught himself the tagging so he could read it in the original.

35:49.990 --> 35:52.532
so he could do those wonderful illustrations.

35:53.293 --> 35:55.996
They were wonderful.

35:56.176 --> 35:58.958
I'm collecting dozens of these great little stories.

35:59.919 --> 36:05.724
We'll use them in the ... Can we see some of your things?

36:07.226 --> 36:07.946
Cypress and Wood.

36:08.747 --> 36:11.950
This is from the Monterey Cypress.

36:11.990 --> 36:19.457
This granite is from the quarry where the ...

36:19.758 --> 36:25.426
Why didn't he pull the stone to actually build his house from?

36:25.446 --> 36:34.439
There's just this little limited that was done of, and it's kind of great shakes as far as the contents so much.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.261
Gratits, I think.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.543
Gratits, I think.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.105
But it's very nice to have my paper.

36:41.469 --> 36:46.035
A fellow we're interviewing Thursday, Sanford Burger, lives right next to the public objective site.

36:49.643 --> 36:53.927
Sculpture for the most part, yeah.

36:53.987 --> 36:56.449
Now, did this case, did you have that made?

36:56.469 --> 36:58.211
Oh, no, this is how it was.

36:58.271 --> 36:59.552
Oh, that's how it was.

36:59.672 --> 37:03.476
And what was the limitation of it?

37:03.596 --> 37:04.297
A hundred of them?

37:06.839 --> 37:08.561
See, you've got the giant limitation.

37:11.784 --> 37:13.265
This is part of the Beckett collection, actually.

37:13.285 --> 37:15.608
There were some paintings in the Beckett collection that I thought it was.

37:15.688 --> 37:17.049
Was it paintings or lithos?

37:17.129 --> 37:18.250
No paintings, original paintings.

37:18.938 --> 37:22.723
Oh, this is wonderful.

37:22.743 --> 37:26.687
Ah, I feel it.

37:26.707 --> 37:27.829
It seems minuscule to me.

37:28.590 --> 37:41.625
I had the, you know, so much of the stuff that I buy is little stuff and hard to stand up, so I had to come to make these library doors.

37:41.705 --> 37:43.367
That's wonderful.

37:43.407 --> 37:44.048
What is the wood?

37:44.408 --> 37:45.550
Cherry.

37:45.570 --> 37:45.790
Yes.

37:47.862 --> 37:51.126
That's great.

37:51.146 --> 37:54.010
Yeah, there's the street car.

37:54.250 --> 37:58.115
And they handled this.

37:58.135 --> 38:00.578
This is how the scholars were.

38:00.598 --> 38:03.842
How is it right?

38:04.202 --> 38:06.765
That's how it was.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.646
Well, I saw it there.

38:07.666 --> 38:10.510
This is a guy that's great.

38:10.530 --> 38:11.912
Yeah, you guys told the other one.

38:11.932 --> 38:15.456
So, you know, there's a catalog for them all this time.

38:17.512 --> 38:21.778
That's why I'm hiding it behind here, so it doesn't get the sun.

38:21.998 --> 38:28.707
Fortunately, this room doesn't get much sunlight anyway.

38:28.747 --> 38:30.890
How did you decide which ones to put behind glass?

38:30.970 --> 38:33.994
We're going through the same debate right now.

38:34.094 --> 38:37.438
I think the ones that, well, cost-wise, I'm the one.

38:38.259 --> 38:42.585
Usually the ones behind the glass would cost more, just for keeping them away from little pens.

38:43.406 --> 38:44.768
And the stuff that I wanted to

38:46.182 --> 38:47.724
that was a little more fragile.

38:47.884 --> 38:54.134
You know, like the Uncorrected Proof of Confederacy of Dunces, I didn't want it somewhere where it could just be pulled out because of the covers.

38:54.174 --> 38:54.754
That's nice.

38:55.956 --> 39:03.888
The advanced reading copy of The, with the gateway.

39:03.988 --> 39:05.089
Do you collect Walker Percy?

39:05.150 --> 39:06.632
No, you must collect Walker Percy.

39:06.652 --> 39:07.132
No, I don't.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.297
I've never been a great fan of Walker Percy, unfortunately.

39:10.457 --> 39:13.101
I thought he was the greatest living American author myself.

39:13.874 --> 39:16.097
That's pretty nice.

39:17.238 --> 39:18.299
It's anti-directed proof.

39:18.620 --> 39:18.860
Yes.

39:19.621 --> 39:21.223
Well, actually, I don't think that really exists.

39:21.243 --> 39:24.547
I think basically what it is, is it's really considered an advanced reading copy.

39:25.788 --> 39:26.649
May I?

39:26.689 --> 39:28.732
And I can tell you.

39:28.752 --> 39:32.136
I should say.

39:32.156 --> 39:37.262
Particularly since there's a little letter, too.

39:37.282 --> 39:38.523
Let's see if there's any pagination.

39:39.364 --> 39:41.687
Yeah, there is pagination.

39:41.707 --> 39:42.548
Does it have the copyright?

39:43.051 --> 39:54.621
You learn a lot about bibliography, don't you, when you recover collecting.

39:54.861 --> 40:02.248
John, some of these boxes, I've got to get more boxes to make for some of them, actually.

40:02.628 --> 40:11.436
John Fowles, I gather, is a... Yes, that's the, here's a, this is an old one now, this is my copy of the Clockwork.

40:11.876 --> 40:12.737
That's wonderful.

40:13.088 --> 40:14.610
I bought that from Ralph many years ago.

40:14.970 --> 40:16.652
Boy, Ralph has wonderful books.

40:16.673 --> 40:17.694
Yeah.

40:17.714 --> 40:19.736
I bought this from him.

40:20.978 --> 40:24.042
So really, you don't have that much sentimentality for New Orleans.

40:24.102 --> 40:29.529
I mean, if you don't collect Tennessee Williams and you don't collect Walker Prissy, do you collect Eudora Wealthy from Mississippi?

40:29.709 --> 40:29.769
No.

40:29.809 --> 40:34.114
No, I have some Eudora, but mostly I bought Eudora that was connected to Ann Tyler.

40:34.935 --> 40:36.177
They're stuck together.

40:41.573 --> 40:45.538
character that's a New Orleanian comp.

40:47.581 --> 40:49.023
That's the first there.

40:49.063 --> 40:50.786
That's the becket I bought when I did the play.

40:50.806 --> 40:51.467
This is the set.

40:51.567 --> 40:51.807
Yes.

40:53.009 --> 40:54.250
Oh, that's a very nice set.

40:54.731 --> 40:55.312
It really is.

40:55.552 --> 40:56.934
The jackets are nice and bright.

40:57.114 --> 40:57.415
Yes.

40:57.815 --> 40:59.037
I've kept them in good shape.

40:59.137 --> 41:01.340
Did they have the plastic on them or did you put that on?

41:02.301 --> 41:03.463
Do you have that?

41:03.483 --> 41:04.324
Do you do that yourself?

41:04.344 --> 41:04.985
I do the broad art.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.207
Yeah, I have a lot of the broad art.

41:06.227 --> 41:07.048
I have a big roll of it.

41:07.609 --> 41:10.753
I just got this from the end of the record of the

41:11.763 --> 41:19.352
Tell me about, are you really about Burgess?

41:19.392 --> 41:22.195
Have you ever met him?

41:22.476 --> 41:22.956
No.

41:22.976 --> 41:24.158
I did an interview with him.

41:24.238 --> 41:31.627
I thought about one day maybe just for the hell of a taking his 99 and making it a goal, you know, because I've got number 100 already, so I figured.

41:33.969 --> 41:35.391
Well, I bet you have quite a few of them.

41:35.675 --> 41:38.638
Probably just offhandedly, I would say you're probably right.

41:38.658 --> 41:42.482
Because it really is a decidedly 20th century list, isn't it?

41:42.583 --> 41:43.403
I think it is.

41:43.584 --> 41:44.765
Anything about that could I get.

41:44.805 --> 41:50.211
So this is the illustrated way to get down this.

41:52.273 --> 41:53.074
Beautiful stuff.

41:53.154 --> 41:55.296
What's your number one prized possession?

41:55.316 --> 41:56.277
I don't know.

41:56.297 --> 42:00.842
I don't know them all.

42:01.763 --> 42:03.285
They're like all children, you know?

42:04.312 --> 42:05.453
Do you look at them in that?

42:05.573 --> 42:07.015
I don't mean to put words in there.

42:07.035 --> 42:07.515
No, I do.

42:07.535 --> 42:08.256
I do.

42:08.336 --> 42:09.938
I see if they're standing up all right.

42:10.398 --> 42:13.021
I feel a little need to be touched occasionally.

42:13.902 --> 42:15.664
Do you take them out and...?

42:15.684 --> 42:16.945
All the time.

42:16.965 --> 42:18.126
Yeah.

42:18.907 --> 42:19.788
All the time.

42:20.309 --> 42:20.709
This is a nice copy.

42:20.729 --> 42:27.296
I mean, it's just your first trade of... Yep.

42:27.476 --> 42:29.418
That's the one I read in college, I think.

42:29.438 --> 42:31.861
...inscribed by Beckett.

42:31.921 --> 42:32.501
George Revers.

42:32.522 --> 42:33.002
George?

42:33.893 --> 42:34.474
Can you read it for me?

42:34.514 --> 42:37.217
Yeah, with love and gratitude from his old friend, New York City.

42:39.099 --> 42:40.140
Can't read the rest of it, Sam.

42:42.082 --> 42:43.043
August, maybe?

42:43.643 --> 42:45.706
Something down below.

42:45.746 --> 42:46.927
Yeah, that's the ownership.

42:46.947 --> 42:51.552
George Riefery was an old comrade and publisher.

42:51.592 --> 42:55.096
He loomed large in his biography than when I read this.

42:55.376 --> 42:56.357
Do you feel you know Beckett?

42:56.858 --> 42:58.079
I know his work.

42:58.119 --> 42:58.459
I don't know.

42:58.479 --> 43:01.483
You seem to have a passion for his stuff.

43:01.503 --> 43:01.823
I do.

43:02.103 --> 43:03.765
You know, if I were a writer,

43:05.230 --> 43:07.412
Which I am not.

43:07.432 --> 43:14.198
I would think the ideal thing to do right now is if you sit down and write a one-man show of Beckett quickly and get Peter O'Toole to play it.

43:14.218 --> 43:15.238
Would you like to play it?

43:15.258 --> 43:16.680
No, I couldn't play Beckett.

43:16.740 --> 43:17.921
What do you mean you couldn't?

43:17.941 --> 43:19.862
You probably know his works better than anyone.

43:19.882 --> 43:21.684
I'm just young, number one.

43:22.164 --> 43:23.125
To do his own.

43:23.145 --> 43:28.490
To do him, though, Beckett sitting down and talking to an audience for an hour, I think would be absolutely phenomenal.

43:28.530 --> 43:32.673
Just a copy of... He's old Jim Thomas.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.035
Oh, he's really hot, isn't he?

43:35.470 --> 43:47.625
This is a little copy of Footfalls by Beckett, but this is the copy he used while he directed the play, and his holograph corrections to the text, or how he changed, how many footsteps, which direction to go.

43:47.645 --> 43:52.191
You get that in this country?

43:53.913 --> 43:54.774
Yes.

43:54.794 --> 44:05.427
The story that I'm talking about story, Beckett was directing Billy Whitewell in a play of his called Not I, which is this

44:05.693 --> 44:07.656
Short little piece, about 18 minutes long.

44:08.176 --> 44:10.960
And the only thing you see on the stage is a woman's mouth, the whole play.

44:10.980 --> 44:14.444
She's just jabbering, really, really jabbering.

44:14.465 --> 44:17.008
And she couldn't memorize a lot of the words.

44:18.029 --> 44:19.171
And he told the stage about it.

44:19.191 --> 44:20.913
He said, I'm going to give her a bit of help.

44:20.933 --> 44:30.546
So he sat down and on the three-fold blank sheets of paper wrote this story about this woman.

44:31.487 --> 44:33.169
And he said, read this to her.

44:33.368 --> 44:34.009
this white helper.

44:34.029 --> 44:37.753
So this guy has this short story written by Samuel Beckett in his own hand.

44:38.093 --> 44:40.696
And he just pulled it up and put the copy of his book and brought home.

44:40.736 --> 44:42.758
He never thought about it until recently.

44:42.778 --> 44:44.940
He thought, I've got a manuscript.

44:45.641 --> 44:46.502
Samuel Beckett manuscript.

44:46.522 --> 44:48.344
And most of those are in, you know, Texas.

44:49.706 --> 44:50.366
Where we've been.

44:50.386 --> 44:51.768
We spent five days in Texas.

44:52.388 --> 44:53.189
Did you?

44:53.770 --> 44:59.376
And this is the, I have two copies of it, the signed edition of the collected.

44:59.862 --> 45:03.626
Do you have the new collection, the Beckett stuff, on hand?

45:03.866 --> 45:08.350
The Beckett stuff, there's some in here, like some of Nose Knife in here, our examination.

45:09.291 --> 45:14.576
Most of this entire catalog is Beckett.

45:14.596 --> 45:15.077
All of that.

45:15.597 --> 45:16.458
From that collection?

45:16.478 --> 45:17.619
Yes, all of this.

45:18.159 --> 45:24.045
Is there anything by Beckett that you don't have that you know of?

45:24.606 --> 45:27.068
As far as original first edition stuff, no.

45:28.870 --> 45:32.393
is a really nice inscribed first of Endgame.

45:32.413 --> 45:33.234
Which you'd really like.

45:33.294 --> 45:34.255
Yes, that I would like.

45:34.595 --> 45:37.839
And Ralph supposedly... That's kind of on your head list.

45:37.999 --> 45:45.726
And the... So to say that there really isn't anything that you have a burning... No, that I do.

45:45.806 --> 45:50.731
I do have a... I think I have a signed edition, a signed copy of Endgame.

45:50.851 --> 45:53.353
But you want an inscribed one, which would be nice.

45:53.373 --> 45:55.736
Right, because this is just the acting edition that I have somewhere.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.257
I'm not even... It's not even really the first.

45:57.912 --> 45:59.755
Now, you just acquired this collection?

46:00.276 --> 46:02.239
But two or three months before Beckett died.

46:02.640 --> 46:06.325
Oh, well, that's, but what was in the, what did you have in these shelves prior to that?

46:07.207 --> 46:08.970
Nothing, because we just moved back into this house.

46:09.070 --> 46:09.510
Oh, I see.

46:09.531 --> 46:11.834
So this library has just been built.

46:11.854 --> 46:13.076
Because that's a problem I have.

46:13.096 --> 46:16.381
I get something I really love, and I have to move something else.

46:16.562 --> 46:18.365
All of this is Beckett also.

46:18.425 --> 46:22.231
That's mostly the criticism, most of the criticism on him.

46:22.251 --> 46:24.274
And the other stuff, most of this is not even really,

46:25.132 --> 46:53.232
this is just my books from the old days you know except the the carol pincher in here and the plays out that i've done in my time stuff is for reading and those guys this is all the buchowski a lot of the buchowskis i like the way black sparrow makes books i think they do nice nice work um it's just one of one of a hundred is wilson's book on book collecting yes none of them but i love

46:54.207 --> 46:57.532
Is this one, the first book of the Alan Ahern?

46:58.253 --> 47:01.016
The book of first books, do you think of that?

47:01.637 --> 47:03.039
Yeah, that just recently came out.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.462
The one that just came out from Putnam?

47:06.003 --> 47:07.025
This is pretty old.

47:07.365 --> 47:09.208
Okay, yeah, he just did another one from Putnam.

47:09.348 --> 47:11.851
Right, but it's on book collecting as a whole, right?

47:11.871 --> 47:12.833
Not just first books.

47:12.853 --> 47:16.858
That's correct, but he also has a section there on a 10 or 15,000.

47:16.978 --> 47:18.540
And this is inscribed to Bob Wilson.

47:19.121 --> 47:20.183
That's nice, yeah.

47:20.203 --> 47:21.885
He's always at all the shows, Alan Ahern.

47:22.507 --> 47:23.788
I didn't have a boat on them.

47:24.509 --> 47:24.609
Yeah.

47:28.453 --> 47:32.337
I would say, yeah, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

47:32.377 --> 47:33.718
These are gorgeous shelves, by the way.

47:33.858 --> 47:35.319
One, two, three, four.

47:35.339 --> 47:37.602
I'm just trying to, I'd say 2,000 books in here, maybe.

47:37.682 --> 47:39.203
I would say that's pretty close.

47:39.223 --> 47:45.169
Some of these, some of these shelves, some of these shelves are doubled.

47:47.091 --> 47:49.033
Every one of them.

47:49.073 --> 47:51.315
She doesn't write about the South as much as,

47:51.633 --> 47:53.196
What do you think of her?

47:53.696 --> 47:55.780
I like her because she's an artist, don't you think?

47:55.960 --> 48:01.349
Yes, but she's a New Orleanian lady, and I've got a... Yeah, but you're inconsistent on that.

48:01.389 --> 48:06.938
You already told me you don't collect... Well, the thing is, Walker Percy is in New Orleans.

48:07.840 --> 48:08.982
Well, he's Covington.

48:09.002 --> 48:09.723
He's Covington.

48:09.743 --> 48:12.507
Tennessee Williams wasn't really New Orleans either, wasn't he?

48:12.527 --> 48:14.651
I mean, like Truman Capote wasn't really.

48:15.252 --> 48:18.417
A lot of people had claimed to be New Orleans.

48:18.683 --> 48:25.693
But I mean, they certainly affected a love and a knowledge and a passion for the place, I guess.

48:25.753 --> 48:26.234
Without a doubt.

48:26.294 --> 48:27.876
But I don't want to care.

48:27.896 --> 48:29.799
It's just fun talking.

48:29.819 --> 48:31.582
But I love Walker Press.

48:31.882 --> 48:32.503
Have you read this?

48:32.543 --> 48:33.745
This is John Goodman.

48:33.765 --> 48:34.726
This is John Locke.

48:34.747 --> 48:35.167
Oh, man.

48:36.209 --> 48:41.657
Books seem to me to be pestilent things and infect all their trade in them.

48:41.677 --> 48:42.478
Oh, this is very good.

48:43.760 --> 48:46.864
Ellipse was something very perverse and brutal, period.

48:47.345 --> 48:48.066
It's my type of

48:48.653 --> 48:52.218
printers, binders, sellers, and ampersand.

48:52.819 --> 49:03.255
Others that make a trade and gain out of them have universal ease, so are they turn in a corruption of mind that they have a way of dealing peculiar to themselves and not conformed to the good of society.

49:03.275 --> 49:04.356
This is the next one.

49:04.376 --> 49:06.660
And a general fairness which cements mankind.

49:06.700 --> 49:08.623
John Locke, 1632, 1904.

49:09.264 --> 49:10.505
That's very nice.

49:10.525 --> 49:11.927
Oh, that's very nice.

49:11.948 --> 49:12.709
That's lovely.

49:12.729 --> 49:18.357
I also have another copy of this printed on an illustration by Edward Gorey.

49:18.640 --> 49:25.369
of a man standing next to a cliff with a book and right at the frame of these two feet going over the place.

49:25.409 --> 49:29.535
Have you seen the Cyril pictures, Slightly Foxed But Still Desirable?

49:30.176 --> 49:32.199
Oh, that's great.

49:32.740 --> 49:33.841
Ask Ralph about it.

49:33.881 --> 49:37.667
It's not published in this country yet, but they've been selling it at the book for you.

49:37.687 --> 49:45.818
It's a series of drawings, but representing the book trade with phrases like Slightly Foxed But Still Desirable.

49:45.838 --> 49:46.639
So there's a woman on that.

49:47.007 --> 49:49.550
She's slightly gross, but still desirable, you know.

49:50.210 --> 49:51.652
And there'd be 20 or 30 of these.

49:52.593 --> 49:56.838
And it's a great book that you can... I found one of the books.

49:56.858 --> 50:04.726
This is the first thing that I think it was published separately in the horoscope, the poem he wrote for the competition in the magazine.

50:04.947 --> 50:06.668
There were 300 copies of the book.

50:08.090 --> 50:09.492
He won 10 pounds for writing it.

50:09.512 --> 50:11.394
That's great.

50:11.414 --> 50:13.236
What was the year on this?

50:13.276 --> 50:16.339
30... It's a gorgeous ship.

50:18.175 --> 50:18.956
Little fox.

50:19.456 --> 50:20.177
Can you treat that?

50:21.118 --> 50:23.241
I suppose you could.

50:23.261 --> 50:28.867
You might want to at some point, because you can stop the fox.

50:28.887 --> 50:29.187
Really?

50:29.207 --> 50:29.788
I'm not sure.

50:29.808 --> 50:35.894
30, that's M-H-O-R-O-S-C-O-P-E, Samuel Beckett.

50:35.914 --> 50:36.435
Question 30.

50:36.575 --> 50:44.824
And it says, this poem is awarded the 10-pound prize for the best poem on time in the competition judged by Richard Eldridge and Lindsay Kennard.

50:45.192 --> 50:47.315
at the Hours Press and is published in addition.

50:47.535 --> 50:49.738
A hundred signed copies, that's wonderful.

50:49.758 --> 50:51.540
That's five, that's pence, right?

50:51.960 --> 50:54.804
I suppose it is.

50:54.824 --> 50:55.064
More.

50:55.585 --> 51:00.251
Measurably more than that today, I think.

51:00.271 --> 51:00.351
Yes.

51:00.371 --> 51:03.655
Well, the way inflation is enough.

51:03.795 --> 51:04.476
Do you enjoy this?

51:05.037 --> 51:07.580
Do you get a chance to show your books to many people?

51:08.261 --> 51:10.563
Yeah, I mean, people come over and some people go, oh, nice.

51:10.644 --> 51:12.065
So what do you got for a drink?

51:13.367 --> 51:14.288
A lot of people don't get it.

51:14.639 --> 51:26.135
You know, unless I show them something that they find interesting, like if friends come over who are of my generation as far as music is concerned, I show them this, the songs by George Harrison.

51:27.076 --> 51:29.159
Oh, indeed, sure.

51:29.179 --> 51:33.565
With the limited disc, compact disc in it.

51:33.585 --> 51:34.807
Okay, I've seen such a thing.

51:34.827 --> 51:40.555
And beautiful, beautifully illustrated and printed, signed by Harrison.

51:40.575 --> 51:42.297
You know, they get impressed by stuff like that.

51:42.798 --> 51:42.978
Yeah.

51:42.998 --> 51:44.460
Just like a fold-out in the middle of it.

51:45.132 --> 51:46.093
Interesting, huh?

51:46.113 --> 51:47.414
I mean, it's high-tech.

51:47.434 --> 51:47.935
It's a high-tech book.

51:47.955 --> 51:48.956
Yeah, it's a beautiful book, though.

51:48.976 --> 51:52.139
I mean, when you look at that, just the way it's made, it's... Well, there's a keyboard.

51:52.179 --> 51:53.260
There's a keyboard on the back.

51:54.181 --> 51:54.962
Where was this done?

51:54.982 --> 51:55.503
West Coast?

51:56.123 --> 51:57.985
I wonder.

51:58.005 --> 52:00.408
There's this beautiful picture of this guitar.

52:00.428 --> 52:03.070
Go to the next clip.

52:03.131 --> 52:03.931
Are those lithographs?

52:03.951 --> 52:04.452
They must be.

52:04.712 --> 52:05.973
They look like, well, I can see from here.

52:05.993 --> 52:06.954
It's lithographs, yeah.

52:07.475 --> 52:11.139
It's not off-site printing.

52:11.159 --> 52:11.359
Beautiful.

52:12.875 --> 52:19.704
You don't have any illustrated books or anything, I gather, as a... As a genre suit, no.

52:19.724 --> 52:21.386
This looks like an Emmy Award over here.

52:21.406 --> 52:22.187
Is that what that is?

52:23.049 --> 52:24.931
Uh, yes.

52:24.951 --> 52:25.832
Congratulations.

52:27.534 --> 52:28.135
Congratulations.

52:28.616 --> 52:28.856
What?

52:30.358 --> 52:31.720
Oh, there are four Emmys.

52:31.800 --> 52:32.842
Let the record show.

52:34.083 --> 52:40.432
Not to mention fifth place in the Bass Tournament at the, uh, Port of Raggedy Tournament in Tennessee.

52:41.513 --> 52:42.274
Fifth place.

52:42.895 --> 52:55.453
Between two Emmys, Porter Wagner, W-A-G-O-N-E-R, Celebrity Pro-Am Best, January 5th place, 1988.

52:55.613 --> 52:59.659
This is great.

52:59.839 --> 53:02.583
I know, a little vellius, a little Art Crumb.

53:02.603 --> 53:03.465
I like his painting.

53:04.446 --> 53:05.588
I like his humor in the 60s.

53:06.088 --> 53:10.675
Those originals of his by Jeffrey Weinberg.

53:11.279 --> 53:14.303
was making a set of t-shirts called Meet the Beats.

53:14.323 --> 53:18.929
One of Allen Ginsberg, one of William Barrows, one of Jack Kerouac, and one of Bukowski.

53:19.510 --> 53:22.374
And that was the image he used on the t-shirt of Bukowski.

53:22.394 --> 53:27.781
Bukowski supposedly, the story goes that he got, he was irritated by the shot because it made him look too clean, too neat.

53:27.881 --> 53:31.065
This is from the wedding, looks like around the wedding gown.

53:31.085 --> 53:38.755
And so Krug then did this to put on the t-shirt, and Bukowski thought it made it look a little too raunchy, so they actually never produced the t-shirt.

53:40.068 --> 53:42.550
What attracted you to Bukowski's work, I wonder?

53:43.091 --> 54:00.868
Well, I was drinking at the time myself, and just that, again, that first-person voyage that he goes through, I found at the time very... I described him once as a man who lives under the belly of life, but still has the strength to push one hand out and type with it.

54:01.789 --> 54:03.891
And I identified with him at the time.

54:03.931 --> 54:09.636
I was drinking very, very heavily in 1980 when I found him, and thought

54:09.886 --> 54:10.927
That's not a bad way to go.

54:10.947 --> 54:18.715
If you've got to go to be able to live in this pain, but still be able to somehow communicate, it seems like the appropriate action.

54:18.735 --> 54:21.558
I can never do that, but that's why I stopped drinking.

54:21.758 --> 54:28.685
We haven't discussed that at all, and I don't necessarily believe it has a place and a discussion about book collections.

54:29.846 --> 54:36.894
This is some more of a part of the Becker collection.

54:36.954 --> 54:39.336
It's just paintings where they set in Seattle.

54:40.126 --> 54:44.731
That's wonderful.

54:44.831 --> 54:49.417
Mostly from photographs in books that I have come across.

54:49.437 --> 54:51.179
Did you ever correspond with him?

54:51.199 --> 54:51.719
No.

54:51.739 --> 54:56.244
I once started writing a letter to him and tore it up, and I thought, how silly.

54:56.264 --> 55:04.434
This is a rather rare Robertson-Juckers poem, a homage to his dog, when his dog died.

55:05.175 --> 55:06.336
These are three

55:06.603 --> 55:08.506
What's the motif over here?

55:08.546 --> 55:14.496
You know, I would think that those are probably gauch and beautiful.

55:15.357 --> 55:16.078
Maybe tempura.

55:16.118 --> 55:17.481
I'm not that familiar with paint.

55:17.541 --> 55:20.686
The true collector, you have them on your shelf, but you don't have them on the wall.

55:21.307 --> 55:21.607
No.

55:21.627 --> 55:22.148
Interesting.

55:22.349 --> 55:24.051
Well, there's only so much wall space.

55:24.192 --> 55:25.073
Yeah, but you enjoy them.

55:25.153 --> 55:30.261
I mean, the collector of art puts them on the wall for other people.

55:30.281 --> 55:33.707
The book collector, I think, has satisfaction.

55:34.210 --> 55:36.253
You don't have to show them to other people.

55:36.373 --> 55:36.854
That's true.

55:37.314 --> 55:37.735
It's interesting.

55:37.755 --> 55:39.978
You took the pictures off the top shelf to show us.

55:42.121 --> 55:44.745
But, I mean, that's something that you see for collectors.

55:44.765 --> 55:46.608
And look at that.

55:47.089 --> 55:48.190
I can't even pronounce that.

55:48.671 --> 55:49.873
Burmicide, I think.

55:50.373 --> 55:50.874
Burmicide.

55:51.816 --> 55:52.877
Burmicide.

55:52.917 --> 55:53.358
Burmicide.

55:53.498 --> 55:58.485
It's just a wonderful poem of his dog saying goodbye to them, I suppose.

55:58.505 --> 56:01.209
It's relatively rare.

56:01.229 --> 56:03.913
I just came across it.

56:04.315 --> 56:05.537
30 copies of it printed.

56:07.439 --> 56:10.343
Nice.

56:10.363 --> 56:12.426
It's all stuff like that that makes it worthwhile.

56:13.407 --> 56:15.089
We're not going to take up too much of your time.

56:18.433 --> 56:22.779
You did mention, and I didn't bring it up at all, but you did mention the drinking.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.083
Is this any kind of a substitute, you think, for you?

56:26.103 --> 56:27.345
No, no, no.

56:27.365 --> 56:29.007
No substitute for drinking is not drinking.

56:37.289 --> 56:49.909
And this frame was made for me by a prisoner, made out of camel cigarettes.

56:50.030 --> 57:04.613
We have Mr. Beckett over here once again.

57:05.082 --> 57:09.207
But I keep this to remind you where I've been and where I could go very easily.

57:09.227 --> 57:14.914
Yeah, the drinking is just, you know, that's what this was.

57:14.934 --> 57:19.119
I'm an alcoholic and there's only two ways for an alcoholic to go whether to drink or not.

57:19.139 --> 57:22.123
This is how one night I decided not to drink.

57:22.143 --> 57:24.246
But this is, as you said, a reminder or?

57:24.366 --> 57:30.313
Yeah, just a reminder of, you know, as many times I sat on the bus bench like that hoping that something would come along to take me away.

57:30.901 --> 57:36.608
I keep it next to the Emmys, too, just to remind me not to get too self-important about any kind of achievement.

57:36.628 --> 57:40.333
When I look around this room, I can think, boy, this guy must be pretty important.

57:40.353 --> 57:42.696
Well, he is, actually.

57:42.796 --> 57:46.802
I really, and it sounds like false modesty, but I really try to take no credit whatsoever.

57:46.822 --> 57:58.697
I show up and try to just take care of my responsibilities and hope that whatever happens is pleasant, but I can't say I did it.

57:59.656 --> 58:01.759
because it just doesn't mean anything when I say that to myself.

58:04.763 --> 58:12.133
It's always wonderful, but so much of it is luck.

58:13.254 --> 58:21.185
Well, as Hemingway said, if I can call Hemingway, Hemingway was asked what it takes to be a great writer, and he said, well, there's no substitute for hard work.

58:21.225 --> 58:22.407
He said, you have to work, work, work.

58:23.128 --> 58:25.551
Second, unfortunately, is talent.

58:25.571 --> 58:27.013
And, well, luck,

58:27.247 --> 58:54.385
hard work i'm sure has played a part i think that you still have to have the talent yeah that's i suppose in some ways true that is true but i get the i get the gamma rays you know they hit me uh that's true and that's one of my criticisms of the binecke library at yale which is absolutely extraordinary if you've ever seen it it's a calm

58:54.972 --> 58:59.296
of 500,000 books going up five stories in the middle, surrounded by glass.

58:59.856 --> 59:00.897
Really?

59:01.217 --> 59:02.098
But it's wonderful.

59:02.118 --> 59:03.099
It's gorgeous.

59:04.660 --> 59:07.923
Tell me a little bit about life after life.

59:11.045 --> 59:24.777
If God be kind, I will for a year maybe just sit here and swap spirit with my kids and my wife and maybe face the absolute demon of sitting down with my own typewriter and maybe trying to get some words on paper for myself.

59:25.162 --> 59:31.467
After that, maybe hopefully, I have some sort of life in feature films.

59:32.388 --> 59:42.117
And at some point in the next two years or so, I have an idea for another television series that I would own and produce myself that I would start developing and hopefully find someone interested in.

59:43.378 --> 59:44.999
Other than that, hopefully buy books and fish.

59:46.040 --> 59:47.802
That's good to me.

59:47.822 --> 59:49.503
My mom's not going to be making you lunch every day.

59:51.084 --> 59:53.987
Because it's been very good, obviously financially, and very good

59:54.187 --> 59:57.013
It was a creative decision to leave?

59:57.033 --> 01:00:13.528
Well, yeah, it's, you know, I think that if I consider myself having a career as an actor, the longer one stays on the same path as an actor, particularly in a show that's been as successful as this, I think the harder and harder it becomes to pursue anything else.
