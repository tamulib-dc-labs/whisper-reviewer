WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:10.525
Well, because they've had to work on it, which is fine with me.

00:12.628 --> 00:17.313
Well, no, my wife collects books and so forth.

00:17.333 --> 00:31.911
But they actually have gotten better care here because, you know, you have no idea what a great asset is to have an expert in the family like my son because he can have them repaired.

00:32.549 --> 00:37.676
and so forth, so there's a lot of benefit to me.

00:38.197 --> 00:48.912
I don't know whether it's nice that you could have your folios for me.

00:49.994 --> 00:56.683
It's been a very interesting experience, because this is my right idea, I want to be sure.

00:57.440 --> 01:04.070
So we discovered certain things, sometimes good, sometimes bad, about the books.

01:04.251 --> 01:07.977
It's an interesting experience.

01:09.058 --> 01:21.658
But, you know, I guess I think some of the pleasure is simply the fact that you found something you were looking for, or if you had something that

01:22.212 --> 01:27.398
You know, as one of my friends said one time, having somebody that nobody else has makes me feel.

01:27.599 --> 01:31.764
I think that's a big, that's always a minor factor.

01:31.784 --> 01:33.626
A minor factor?

01:33.646 --> 01:45.300
Well, after all, if Jack Stinker comes to see me, there's no point in my showing him things that aren't as good as clothes he already has.

01:45.460 --> 01:46.281
What is there?

01:46.341 --> 01:49.866
I have to show him something that maybe he doesn't have.

01:49.886 --> 01:50.566
Are you in here?

01:51.107 --> 01:51.848
No.

01:52.317 --> 02:11.197
I guess I'd like to just try once more if you have any thoughts at all about collecting in general and that concept of bibliomania.

02:12.058 --> 02:14.401
I think you're in a unique position.

02:14.461 --> 02:16.843
Yeah, but I think I'm already responding.

02:16.863 --> 02:22.189
You see, I think the concept itself is a, well, I'll give you, you know,

02:22.945 --> 02:26.130
What people do with books is such a variable thing.

02:27.051 --> 02:31.157
Now, for example, you'll read stories.

02:31.178 --> 02:35.063
You know, I quoted Darwin's statement.

02:35.083 --> 02:44.378
When you read stories of people, for example, that they have books and they can't walk through the house, right?

02:44.538 --> 02:48.904
All right, so it reaches a point where it makes no sense at all, right?

02:48.924 --> 02:51.248
So then you can say there's something wrong with that guy.

02:51.835 --> 02:56.501
The place is a mess, the whole thing, you know, the place is dirty and so forth, and the books are caught up there.

02:57.262 --> 03:08.317
So that's not quite the same as having a different collection of, say, the collection that the garden of it had, which was an outstanding thing, obviously.

03:08.337 --> 03:12.442
I mean, clean, precise, perfect.

03:12.482 --> 03:15.326
There was only 315 items, too.

03:15.526 --> 03:19.311
Yeah, but, you know, the tremendous difference, you know, between

03:19.966 --> 03:21.548
what people do with books.

03:21.568 --> 03:29.520
Now, it doesn't take a professional expert to come to a judgment on what makes sense and what doesn't.

03:30.161 --> 03:40.917
You know, I used to say when I was first back in psychiatry that all I'd have to do was ask my children what they thought of so-and-so and they would pick up and disturb people.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.843
It does not take an astute person

03:45.228 --> 03:47.412
you know, necessarily.

03:47.432 --> 03:52.820
So, you know, well, really, you know, when you take somebody, you know, I pick that example.

03:53.982 --> 03:59.150
So a lot depends on, and I start to say there's a degree.

03:59.190 --> 04:01.234
There's a difference.

04:01.314 --> 04:07.183
For example, one of the most, I mentioned Herbert M. Evans, and I wrote about him.

04:07.243 --> 04:09.747
Herbert, I have the pleasure and knowledge of meeting him.

04:10.368 --> 04:11.370
Herbert M. Evans,

04:11.806 --> 04:13.888
was a great biologist.

04:13.968 --> 04:21.337
He discovered vitamin E, the growth hormone to a drain, any number of major discoveries.

04:21.357 --> 04:23.339
And he also was a bibliophile.

04:25.121 --> 04:27.364
And you've been, you know, break it down.

04:27.504 --> 04:27.965
It's right in there.

04:27.985 --> 04:29.346
I'll just remind myself of it.

04:29.366 --> 04:30.347
It's right in there.

04:31.168 --> 04:38.657
So the reason I mention him is he was a pretty important influence in my

04:40.038 --> 04:44.024
collecting in a negative way.

04:44.684 --> 04:51.314
But the important thing with Evans is he started collecting early.

04:51.454 --> 04:54.979
He had one of the most important exhibits of science books.

04:54.999 --> 04:57.442
He was a pioneer.

04:58.684 --> 05:04.492
Every time he got a divorce, he got in trouble finding out the other seller collections.

05:05.133 --> 05:06.535
And then when he finally

05:07.004 --> 05:11.530
So he made, in his lifetime, I think he made seven collections in history of science.

05:11.950 --> 05:14.193
Well, toward the end, he said he got older.

05:15.195 --> 05:16.997
He had this idiosyncrasy.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.080
You know, he wouldn't pay his bills.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.802
He bought more than he could afford.

05:20.862 --> 05:26.309
So the only thing that could happen is, you know, when people started dubbing him, he had to sell his collection.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.574
As soon as he sold the collection, he got some money, paid off his bill.

05:29.594 --> 05:30.895
Then he fell all over again.

05:31.576 --> 05:33.719
All right, so that doesn't make much sense, does it?

05:33.759 --> 05:34.480
You said you knew him?

05:34.628 --> 05:35.509
Yes, I knew him.

05:35.529 --> 05:41.218
He was an old man, but he's become a guy who's a very important influence in my life.

05:41.579 --> 05:43.662
But that story you can read.

05:44.003 --> 05:46.507
But the point is, sorry, so that doesn't make sense.

05:47.328 --> 05:55.781
Jake Zeitlin, who knew him better than anybody, or as well as I said, his appetite was bigger than his ability to pay for the book.

05:55.881 --> 05:58.886
So that is another form of pathology.

05:59.928 --> 06:02.712
So there's a difference between the guy that

06:03.080 --> 06:15.372
The other ones couldn't really enjoy his collection, because he never paid attention to the financial aspect.

06:15.692 --> 06:18.655
He developed poor credit at the end, you know.

06:18.755 --> 06:26.503
Warren Howell and Jigs Island used to really bankroll him, and he'd build a collection, and they'd sell him.

06:26.763 --> 06:29.506
But he was the pioneer collector, you know, in many ways.

06:30.507 --> 06:31.888
So there's so many differences.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.117
idiosyncrasy to get into.

06:34.157 --> 06:47.233
That's why I say, you know, it's the same, you know, you can take the same story and you can say, well, you don't know, but take a guy like Donald Trump, for example, who has been collecting billions and billions.

06:47.874 --> 06:52.119
Suddenly, you know, he's done something that sabotages him.

06:52.199 --> 06:53.360
You don't know for sure.

06:53.901 --> 06:59.648
But it could very easily be, see, well, you know, he's gotten involved with a woman, too, and so forth.

06:59.965 --> 07:02.427
Well, Evans, I think, was a little bit on that story.

07:04.389 --> 07:07.512
Now, so that's one form of pathology, right?

07:07.672 --> 07:09.654
The other is the guy that hordes it all.

07:10.715 --> 07:19.362
You know, some people, for example, you know, some people really... I've got it.

07:20.123 --> 07:25.528
I want to just finish this line of thought right here when you look at some of the treasures.

07:25.548 --> 07:28.150
I just want you to... I'd like you to finish what you're saying.

07:28.484 --> 07:30.066
Well, I can't say that.

07:30.326 --> 07:34.592
I don't know that I have much more to answer.

07:34.612 --> 07:56.601
The reason I'm pointing out to you, I think it's really a carelessness to arrive at... I recognize that book collecting is not the same as scholarship, and there's always a certain amount of antagonism between scholars and

07:57.020 --> 08:01.446
book collectors because particularly when it comes to manuscripts.

08:01.466 --> 08:13.081
Because, you know, people that buy manuscripts don't necessarily always let them be used by themselves because they lose their manuals.

08:13.922 --> 08:15.344
So, why don't you... Okay.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.708
I might just shut these off right now.

08:18.728 --> 08:22.553
Doctor, do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures of you while I'm here?

08:22.573 --> 08:23.955
Oh, good.

08:24.779 --> 08:37.937
I brought out a couple of interesting books from the Freud section.

08:38.838 --> 08:46.669
This is a copy of Freud's book on aphasia, which he wrote in 1891 before he

08:47.375 --> 08:50.319
when he was still thinking about himself as a neurologist.

08:50.540 --> 08:56.048
And it's presented to one of his closest friends from that period, Dr. Wilhelm Fleece.

08:57.210 --> 08:58.231
That's famous.

08:58.251 --> 08:59.653
It's quite an association cut, isn't it?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.778
Yes, it's a very interesting association.

09:03.199 --> 09:05.362
Can I just take a picture?

09:05.382 --> 09:05.562
Sure.

09:07.205 --> 09:11.391
You're going to be in the catalog anyhow.

09:17.632 --> 09:30.030
And then this is a copy of Freud and Breuer's work on the studies in hysteria, which was the landmark book in psychoanalysis.

09:30.050 --> 09:34.177
And this actually belonged to Joseph Breuer's wife, Matilda.

09:37.822 --> 09:39.024
These are pretty great books.

09:40.045 --> 09:42.709
So you were interested in association copies as well.

09:42.729 --> 09:46.575
Well, that was a very important aspect of my collection.

09:46.960 --> 09:52.788
I think you're probably fine.

09:52.808 --> 09:57.335
I wouldn't guess, but I'll bet you there are one-third of associations.

09:57.615 --> 09:59.718
That's a good guess, I would think.

09:59.779 --> 10:03.905
Why was that important to you as a collector?

10:03.925 --> 10:08.231
I think because it added an extra dimension to the experience.

10:09.052 --> 10:13.238
See, after all, the books themselves

10:14.213 --> 10:24.245
exposure to the minds of the great pioneers, but the associations give you a glimpse into their biography.

10:25.127 --> 10:38.443
So, for example, I'll say something about it if you want to look through, because you'll get a few more ideas, but that's the fact.

10:38.483 --> 10:41.447
I'll explain that in a little more detail.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.309
Why don't you go ahead and talk to somebody else.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.298
Okay.

10:46.920 --> 10:55.590
Dr. Norman is also collected extensively in the history of Mesmerism and the Greek Mesmer, Franz Mesmer, I'm sorry.

10:56.271 --> 11:09.147
And this is a copy of Mesmer's book on sort of a manifesto of Mesmerism, which belonged to a society that's called the Society of Harmony, which was founded by his followers.

11:09.167 --> 11:13.532
So Mesmer was really the beginning of psychopaths.

11:14.002 --> 11:24.795
Is that the original binding, by the way?

11:25.215 --> 11:26.397
It's a contemporary binding.

11:27.138 --> 11:27.438
Yeah.

11:27.819 --> 11:32.805
I mean, you probably know that books of this period were not often soul bound.

11:35.788 --> 11:38.732
And then this is a copy of Darwin's Origin of Species.

11:38.752 --> 11:43.097
And I brought this up because you probably also know this, but Darwin is

11:43.280 --> 11:48.191
This book is famous for never having a presentation inscription in Darwin's hand.

11:48.712 --> 11:57.050
All presentation copies, like this one actually, say, from the author in the publisher's hand.

11:57.070 --> 11:58.734
You know, some secretary of the public.

11:58.754 --> 12:00.698
But this one has this

12:01.066 --> 12:05.971
sheet of paper laid in with an inscription in Darwin's hand which says you can paste this in your copy if you want to.

12:06.071 --> 12:25.352
You have no idea how hard it went to me not to paste that in.

12:25.450 --> 12:36.185
That's going to be in the book.

12:38.027 --> 12:38.948
That is wonderful.

12:40.370 --> 12:41.952
And what do we have here?

12:42.794 --> 12:47.460
This is a copy of another important book in the history of psychiatry.

12:47.500 --> 12:52.707
This is by Johann Bayer, who was one of the first to write about

12:53.210 --> 12:58.696
demonic possession of mental illness rather than this, you know, demonic possession.

12:58.997 --> 13:00.618
And this is the fifth edition.

13:00.638 --> 13:05.544
It was bound for the great French collector Jacques de Tou.

13:05.564 --> 13:09.769
This is his coat of arms and this is his cipher.

13:11.030 --> 13:17.057
It's interesting because this is one of the few examples of a scientific book that's actually had a nice finding.

13:17.628 --> 13:23.655
There's an important aspect about this book which I discovered through reading.

13:23.675 --> 13:26.879
There's at least one that I think is applicable.

13:27.039 --> 13:30.043
Can I have Dr. Newell holding the book here?

13:30.363 --> 13:38.874
I'm just going to move these in the background because I love the background of these book pieces.

13:38.894 --> 13:41.136
Look at these numbers, the number of shelf numbers.

13:41.156 --> 13:44.260
Oh yeah, they look like they were written in the 19th century.

13:47.564 --> 13:51.729
Can we get closer to those bookcases, perhaps?

13:51.869 --> 14:04.804
It's just a wonderful background and epic.

14:04.824 --> 14:08.408
It was an interesting story.

14:09.510 --> 14:13.895
It was 1598 I read.

14:13.915 --> 14:16.778
This particular man wrote this book.

14:17.483 --> 14:38.932
was the president of the Parliament of Paris, and a mentally ill person was brought to his attention, and the issue was whether or not he was going to be burned in the state.

14:38.952 --> 14:44.019
Well, apparently Meyer was a humanitarian, and he was the first person to make out against the inhumane treatment of people regardless of that.

14:44.039 --> 14:47.203
So the owner of this book decided to

14:47.572 --> 14:50.877
that meant he had sent to a hospital.

14:51.417 --> 14:58.807
So I thought I'd say I think it was a copy of the book that influenced him now.

14:58.827 --> 15:02.312
Of course, I can't prove it.

15:03.454 --> 15:13.728
A copy of Harvey's book on the circulation of blood, and it's important.

15:14.008 --> 15:16.752
This particular copy is important because it belongs to a

15:17.660 --> 15:26.808
to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who was a German scholar and anthropologist.

15:26.828 --> 15:29.311
And he's annotated it extensively here.

15:29.331 --> 15:32.033
And there's actually a note here about how rare this book is.

15:32.053 --> 15:36.798
And this note was made in the 18th century.

15:36.818 --> 15:37.818
So it's interesting.

15:37.839 --> 15:47.127
And it's also a signature here of a man named Constantine Huygens, who was the father of Christian Huygens, who discovered the rings of Saturn.

15:47.815 --> 16:03.242
Yeah, it has good provenance, but unfortunately the plates are from another tradition, and this particular copy blocks its plates along the way.

16:03.262 --> 16:08.972
But the association of, you know, the association is so important and interesting.

16:08.992 --> 16:12.658
Bluenbach is also a big book collector that Jeremy actually acquired

16:13.313 --> 16:20.642
a very large portion of Blumenbach's library several years ago, which was about ten years ago now.

16:20.662 --> 16:27.490
Yeah, which had survived intact from the time it was sold in 1840 or something like that.

16:27.650 --> 16:36.701
And it actually made the migration from Germany to Indiana or something like that.

16:38.783 --> 16:39.384
Yeah, he talks about that.

16:39.504 --> 16:40.285
Yeah, he talks about that.

16:40.805 --> 16:42.207
Yeah, I will.

16:43.908 --> 16:49.783
Are these among your favorite heist blocks?

16:49.949 --> 16:51.671
But this is not a high-spot collection.

16:51.731 --> 16:53.412
I think that's very important to point out.

16:53.652 --> 16:57.456
Well, I'd say it's not, but it also is.

16:57.516 --> 17:03.401
I wouldn't say that we have... You don't exclude high-spots, is what I'm saying, but I think it's a comprehensive collection.

17:03.421 --> 17:05.083
Well, it's a comprehensive collection.

17:05.123 --> 17:05.964
It's my taste.

17:06.044 --> 17:09.667
Whatever that is, I decide what to do.

17:10.188 --> 17:14.131
So we had a big thing about that.

17:14.872 --> 17:15.973
He left it up to me.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.015
I had to put in another thousand items.

17:18.097 --> 17:22.143
Oh, this isn't the whole collection?

17:22.163 --> 17:24.807
Well, the rest is not important, you know.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.850
Here's the most important book I am.

17:27.571 --> 17:28.913
The most important book I am.

17:29.034 --> 17:30.716
Yeah, like plain art.

17:30.736 --> 17:31.858
Yeah.

17:31.938 --> 17:36.505
See, this is, I told you, you'll read about this also in the right.

17:36.545 --> 17:39.810
This is a copy of the fabric of the Salier.

17:41.272 --> 17:41.893
Of what I'm saying?

17:42.397 --> 17:45.200
of the most important anatomy book.

17:45.761 --> 17:53.069
And this is a copy that was given by the Emperor Charles V to a French ambassador.

17:53.089 --> 17:54.871
It's a French ambassador.

17:54.891 --> 17:57.914
Can you get a full picture?

17:57.934 --> 18:04.301
Oh, well, could I get that with the color?

18:04.502 --> 18:09.307
Yeah, I can't actually.

18:09.327 --> 18:12.150
I really want you to collect it.

18:15.303 --> 18:43.757
Now, I'm sure you know that this copy is dedicated now to the Emperor Charles V, in 1543, and it is thought, and we're pretty convinced, since it's the only copy like this in the world, that this is the copy that the author brought to the Emperor on publication of the book,

18:44.193 --> 18:47.678
I'll just show you some of them.

18:47.698 --> 18:48.579
Are these hand-colored?

18:48.599 --> 18:50.021
These must be hand-colored.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.042
They had to be hand-colored.

18:51.102 --> 18:53.506
They had to be, because there was no color and gray.

18:53.646 --> 18:56.069
These were old, too.

18:56.109 --> 19:00.735
There's gilt work, and it's very important during the period.

19:02.237 --> 19:08.566
When you see a modern anatomy book, the color of the flesh is not red like this.

19:08.586 --> 19:11.770
It tends to be in the crowd, because they're dealing with cadavers.

19:12.408 --> 19:15.974
In those days, they dealt with fresh specimens.

19:15.994 --> 19:18.938
These were seeds that were hung and they dissected.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.741
So the blood, they're all red.

19:20.781 --> 19:26.931
These are all the muscle men.

19:27.011 --> 19:33.201
Look at that they've been drawn.

19:33.485 --> 19:37.872
This was the book I got instead of the Copernicus.

19:37.892 --> 19:38.733
I think this is better.

19:38.894 --> 19:43.341
Well, it's a matter of change.

19:43.461 --> 19:46.946
I should have had both, of course.

19:46.966 --> 19:48.228
That's the collector, you see.

19:49.150 --> 19:54.939
No, no, but this is the book that makes that collection important.

19:55.039 --> 19:58.885
Because, you know, in that period,

19:59.253 --> 20:07.762
At that period, this is the beginning of science in the Western world.

20:07.782 --> 20:11.166
Looking on a few more pages there.

20:11.346 --> 20:17.012
All of the—even the letters you see are colored.

20:17.052 --> 20:21.457
Oh, there's one other aspect that's important here.

20:21.517 --> 20:23.940
The portrait.

20:24.080 --> 20:24.180
Yeah.

20:24.751 --> 20:27.714
I'm amazed this left the continent.

20:27.734 --> 20:28.876
I wonder how this... Yeah.

20:29.617 --> 20:51.602
This is the only portrait that can be identified as that of the author, which was done during his lifetime in his poem, so we have to assume that it's a fairly good rendition to be an ultimation point.

20:52.173 --> 20:55.477
And binding is in purple velvet.

20:55.577 --> 20:58.540
That's imperial coloring.

20:58.800 --> 21:03.485
How is it possible that this became available?

21:03.645 --> 21:07.049
How did this book become available to a private collector, I wonder?

21:07.069 --> 21:15.638
Well, in the first place, I don't really know how the dealer got it, but if you can believe it, it was bought out of the catalog.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.203
You bought it out of the catalog, but the dealer got it out of the catalog.

21:20.223 --> 21:21.825
No, it was the other catalog.

21:21.991 --> 21:25.316
See, timing was very important.

21:26.418 --> 21:31.625
Harvey Cushing, who was a great collector of assailions, had died in 1939.

21:32.587 --> 21:38.776
John Fulton, who was an associate, died a few years later, in 1960, I guess.

21:38.796 --> 21:43.263
This book became available on the market in 1962.

21:44.545 --> 21:47.670
And it actually happened.

21:47.690 --> 21:51.255
The dealer who had told me about hernicas

21:51.674 --> 21:56.001
After I lost the book and I wrote it, he said, don't worry, I'll get you another great book.

21:56.662 --> 22:05.716
So about 1963, I think, he said, I found you a great book.

22:05.736 --> 22:07.078
So I said, what is it?

22:08.080 --> 22:10.604
You have all that in return.

22:10.945 --> 22:13.108
So he told me that it's colored.

22:14.118 --> 22:22.492
my friend said, don't buy a colored copy, because most woodcut books are colored by children.

22:23.894 --> 22:31.226
So I wrote back to him and said, Mr. Howell thinks it's a mistake, but he's wrong.

22:31.707 --> 22:34.331
So he agreed to hold the books.

22:34.351 --> 22:35.533
So I believe in that.

22:36.495 --> 22:38.438
They held it in Paris for about

22:38.772 --> 22:43.118
I don't know, a month, because I couldn't go to Europe that right, that easily.

22:43.438 --> 22:47.524
It was during the summertime, I guess, when we were going to go to Europe.

22:47.644 --> 22:50.908
So they held the book, and I got—meantime, I did my homework.

22:51.729 --> 22:55.174
I read up as much as I could on the salience.

22:56.375 --> 23:04.005
So, you know, it didn't take five minutes for me to realize what was when I saw the book.

23:04.125 --> 23:06.889
So I just said, yeah, of course, I said so.

23:07.392 --> 23:09.495
They let me pay it off over a year.

23:09.896 --> 23:10.817
That's nice.

23:11.037 --> 23:11.839
Who was the dealer?

23:12.700 --> 23:17.127
I think there were three people involved.

23:17.147 --> 23:23.416
The main people were Thomas Shaler.

23:24.377 --> 23:26.120
You'll have all of that.

23:26.280 --> 23:31.107
There were two dealers in addition to Ernest Weil in England.

23:31.748 --> 23:36.235
Weil was the person in London who held it for me.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.044
I think he may have been a part.

23:39.064 --> 23:43.752
I think there may have been three of them involved in it.

23:43.773 --> 23:49.242
But it was a very productive trip for me, because I got to know these other fellows, and they sold me some good books, too.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.606
You brought it back, or it was shipped?

23:51.746 --> 23:53.730
It had to be shipped.

23:53.750 --> 23:56.194
How did you feel when you added this to the collection?

23:56.214 --> 23:57.456
How did I feel what?

23:57.717 --> 23:59.560
Well, I mean, was it a sense of triumph?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.243
Was it a sense of...

24:02.050 --> 24:03.371
I don't know.

24:03.391 --> 24:04.272
I mean, I was pleased.

24:04.993 --> 24:11.960
I mean, you know, I'll tell you, I think I was very naive about football I can possess now.

24:11.980 --> 24:21.130
One of my biggest problems was the idea that I assumed I was going to get whatever I wanted if I waited long enough when I was younger, you know.

24:21.150 --> 24:30.319
You know, I didn't—I've not been the kind that—I didn't go nuts if I lost a boyfriend like that.

24:30.502 --> 24:37.709
In fact, even occasionally other people have them.

24:37.729 --> 24:41.733
But I felt, you know, I now had my great book, right?

24:41.753 --> 24:47.519
So I came back, and suddenly I became an important collector.

24:47.579 --> 24:49.722
I had an important book.

24:49.742 --> 24:54.747
And really that brought me, more people came to see me because of that.

24:54.767 --> 24:57.049
Because as it became known that it was unique,

24:57.383 --> 25:04.971
It was amazing that nobody had gone before because there wasn't, you know... That's one of the joys of collecting.

25:05.051 --> 25:10.718
Well, I said it's having something that nobody else had that gives you importance in the collecting world.

25:10.918 --> 25:26.715
And because, you know, any, you know, at that time, it was not, you know, this was after all, almost 30 years ago, and a lot of these things would have

25:26.915 --> 25:45.479
acquired because of my taste, really.

25:45.499 --> 25:50.867
I mean, for example, as I told you, I was interested in history of psychiatry.

25:50.887 --> 25:54.291
Well, I think in 1954, maybe, I got a copy of Freud's paper on cocaine inscribed by him.

25:54.311 --> 25:55.032
That appealed to me because I'm not.

25:55.349 --> 26:02.015
I have not encountered a thing before.

26:02.155 --> 26:12.905
I wrote my paper for that sort of book at that time, and that remains an important influence.

26:13.025 --> 26:17.269
I do think I probably have more.

26:18.090 --> 26:22.234
You know, would you mind if I have any copies of the

26:23.024 --> 26:28.772
I would love it, something like that.

26:28.792 --> 26:36.083
Connie, can you think of anything you'd like to ask Dr. Bell?

26:37.685 --> 26:39.468
Yeah, this is really wonderful.

26:39.488 --> 26:43.174
So who are you going to see elsewhere?

26:43.334 --> 26:45.317
I came to see you, Dr. Bell.

26:45.377 --> 26:46.939
How am I going to be here?

26:47.071 --> 27:16.639
Well, we're hoping that we write a book that will appeal to... Well, for example, one of the things I'm sure you and I both did,

27:17.024 --> 27:23.436
A lot of the books I bought, I bought because the price was right, right?

27:23.456 --> 27:25.940
You know, you get a bargain.

27:26.301 --> 27:32.011
And I'll never forget when I suddenly discovered that that was the wrong thing to look for, you know.

27:32.071 --> 27:33.053
That's right.

27:33.113 --> 27:34.656
We all learned that lesson.

27:34.796 --> 27:39.104
Yeah, well, I'd say that was a bookseller made that, you know, a bookseller.

27:39.564 --> 27:41.007
They were responsible for that.

27:42.185 --> 27:52.839
since I wasn't buying books that were worth thousands of dollars, you know, it wasn't a big issue.

27:52.859 --> 28:05.074
But, for example, the years I was replacing books, you know, when I could, just to get a better copy.

28:05.094 --> 28:05.475
Stepping up, right.

28:05.495 --> 28:10.521
Because, you know, either they weren't available or I knew what I had with

28:10.838 --> 28:26.214
Like, for example, in this panel, there are two copies of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, but neither of them are the ones that I started with.

28:26.334 --> 28:35.704
And the reason I say that is because it took several years for me to get the last copy.

28:35.945 --> 28:37.286
And so, I mean, you know, it's an evolution.

28:37.406 --> 28:39.208
That's why...

28:39.847 --> 29:00.172
You know, it makes a difference.

29:00.192 --> 29:02.434
And I was very pleased, of course, that I had it to put in there.

29:02.455 --> 29:03.616
And I just mentioned that because of condition.

29:03.636 --> 29:05.358
And I certainly didn't think of those matters for quite some time.

29:05.378 --> 29:08.622
As a matter of luck, that copy that she showed you, that psychiatric book for 50 and 77, I had bought a copy of that.

29:09.293 --> 29:14.698
the same book from the same dealer.

29:15.659 --> 29:22.545
And a year or two later, he said, I have this other copy.

29:22.565 --> 29:23.526
He said, you should buy it.

29:23.546 --> 29:25.328
He said, the two copies.

29:25.348 --> 29:28.991
Well, I really didn't know who the two was at that point, so I looked it up.

29:29.011 --> 29:33.296
And I'm thinking, well, you know, you've been pretty good, so I should buy the book anyhow.

29:33.316 --> 29:37.039
So I bought this as a duplicate copy, because I don't think proud of telling us until I made that judgment.

29:37.593 --> 29:48.643
But that's how it started.

29:53.328 --> 29:57.672
That's when we discovered there were special copies that maybe were interesting.

29:57.692 --> 30:03.337
Now in science, there are very few, very difficult to find books that are in usually fine condition, especially beginning in the 19th, 20th century.

30:03.357 --> 30:05.899
And certainly German and American books are relatively uninteresting as printing and paper and so forth.

30:05.919 --> 30:06.520
But French are better.

30:07.006 --> 30:26.682
So there aren't too many really great copies of science books.

30:26.702 --> 30:27.684
They're not terribly interesting from collecting.

30:27.704 --> 30:28.245
And Freud's are not either.

30:28.265 --> 30:29.647
All of Freud's books were published in the original printed records.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.090
So they're almost all re-bound, you see.

30:31.508 --> 30:42.821
But they were used, as you point out, too.

30:42.841 --> 30:52.552
Well, they were used, and not only that, there were 600 copies only, and some of them were cult, maybe, and so forth.

30:52.572 --> 30:57.938
But the important thing is that they were printed on rather mediocre paper, and most 19th century German books are not that, especially in science.

30:58.323 --> 31:01.567
I'm sure there are exceptions, you know, in the art area and so forth.

31:02.248 --> 31:06.233
So getting good copies is a really difficult thing.

31:06.253 --> 31:09.097
You said you taught a course in the history of class.

31:09.297 --> 31:10.799
Where did you teach that course?

31:11.380 --> 31:13.443
Oh, 30, 30.

31:13.463 --> 31:17.448
The last time I taught history was about 1965.

31:17.468 --> 31:18.630
But you taught it here?

31:18.730 --> 31:23.376
Yeah, the University of California in Mount Vernon Hospital.

31:24.938 --> 31:26.440
So I, I, I,

31:26.943 --> 31:37.374
I really got too busy with other things in my profession.

31:37.575 --> 31:43.101
Do you know anything about psychoanalysis?

31:43.121 --> 31:43.181
No.

31:43.201 --> 31:46.745
My wife knows where I am tonight.

31:46.765 --> 31:49.207
He asked if we don't think about psychoanalysis.

31:49.227 --> 31:51.009
I've been on the faculty of the Psychoanalysis Institute.

31:51.029 --> 31:51.430
I'm a psychoanalyst.

31:51.450 --> 31:52.231
In fact, I'm just retiring from it now.

31:52.251 --> 31:53.592
So that was a very good time-consuming activity for me.

31:54.010 --> 31:58.859
So I stopped teaching that and teaching other things.

31:58.879 --> 32:02.286
Freud has come under some criticism recently.

32:02.306 --> 32:04.150
Always been.

32:04.170 --> 32:15.171
Do you still feel that most of his material, and I'm talking as a strict layman now, I'm just curious, but he has been, how do you, that's a general question.

32:15.231 --> 32:16.153
You know, my opinion is very simple.

32:16.910 --> 32:27.622
History will establish it.

32:27.642 --> 32:31.766
I don't have to worry about it.

32:31.786 --> 32:40.055
I think I've accepted what he presented as a valid and useful, but that doesn't mean that I don't think he was a crook, and some of the people are willing to say.

32:40.075 --> 32:42.398
I think he did what he thought was, he gave what he thought was understandable and meaningful.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.381
But in any science, we don't think he had the last word, and so I'm not terribly worried about it.

32:45.850 --> 33:02.195
But honestly, I mean, I think that whatever happens a hundred years from now, it would depend on who else is able to evaluate.

33:02.215 --> 33:04.919
Right now, you know, this is nitpicking, it's hard not concerned.

33:05.080 --> 33:10.588
So, okay, maybe he didn't say this exactly the way his purpose of doing it, like one of the attacks on his case histories, he wasn't honest or something like that.

33:10.608 --> 33:11.790
Well, he used them to illustrate some of his ideas.

33:12.125 --> 33:22.376
And maybe you may have exaggerated, but that's not the point.

33:22.396 --> 33:24.619
Most of us found these examples useful.

33:24.799 --> 33:31.106
So, but to assume that, you know, they're the last word is nonsensical.

33:31.126 --> 33:33.769
I don't feel terribly involved.

33:33.789 --> 33:35.871
And most of these people that take issue have a history of being

33:36.273 --> 33:38.015
critical for Freud.

33:38.175 --> 33:43.240
I mean, look, there's an article on it in the New York Times somewhere.

33:43.261 --> 33:45.022
There was some professor at MIT.

33:45.042 --> 33:48.646
I think I saw that piece I'm thinking about.

33:48.666 --> 33:49.928
Yeah, I think so.

33:50.328 --> 33:56.795
And his greatest supporter was a professor here who we know is already critical.

33:57.356 --> 33:57.476
He is.

33:57.496 --> 34:03.242
So there's no reason why that shouldn't occur, you know, if you have different kinds of views.

34:03.931 --> 34:17.989
The most important aspect is the way the judges will be made by people who do the work.

34:18.911 --> 34:25.219
They can't be made by people who are historians or writers.

34:25.239 --> 34:33.870
They can be made by the clinicians who build upon what Freud had to say and gain new experience and come up with new ideas and correct them or amplify them or change them.

34:34.357 --> 34:43.767
You know, that's the way it works in science, so it has to be the same way with it.

34:43.787 --> 34:43.887
Okay.

34:43.907 --> 34:50.715
You've given very generously at your time, and I'm going to give you one of these tapes.

34:50.775 --> 34:59.664
I'm going to give you this one, and I'll rewind it, because it has to start on A. Does that take two hours?

35:00.125 --> 35:02.187
It takes an hour on each side.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.719
Thank you.
