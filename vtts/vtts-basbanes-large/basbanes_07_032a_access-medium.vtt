WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.282
private library in the country.

00:04.963 --> 00:28.772
I'm talking with Edwin Wolfe in Philadelphia, and Mr. Wolfe just said that he thought the Shady Library might be... Well, the greatest private library within its field, I mean, which means books that have made a tremendous difference in the history of man, including a Gutenberg Bible in the original Fogel Binding.

00:28.955 --> 00:31.538
I wonder how many of those are privately owned.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.162
I think this may be the last one.

00:35.884 --> 00:47.540
And, of course, privately owned, I don't know how certain it is that everything's going to Princeton, but everybody sort of feels that.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.203
They've allowed the building to be erected.

00:50.223 --> 00:51.545
Right there.

00:52.046 --> 00:53.588
It's sitting there.

00:53.608 --> 00:55.611
It's quite an extraordinary arrangement.

00:56.131 --> 00:57.493
I understand, though, that the...

00:57.828 --> 01:02.492
The current Mr. Scheide has a daughter who's very interested in the collection.

01:02.512 --> 01:03.473
I'll find out about this.

01:03.493 --> 01:04.134
Yeah, sure.

01:04.174 --> 01:08.979
The arrangement with Princeton was, hey, just let us use it.

01:09.379 --> 01:10.680
Make it available to scholars.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.741
And that's an important thing.

01:11.761 --> 01:16.105
Well, Bill Scheide feels very strongly on that.

01:16.926 --> 01:22.531
He believes that the book should be used by people who are doing serious research.

01:23.032 --> 01:25.354
And he's always had a...

01:25.587 --> 01:27.309
curator who knows the collection.

01:27.429 --> 01:28.951
Bill Stoneham, I guess, is the man.

01:29.132 --> 01:29.833
Man now.

01:30.153 --> 01:31.134
Yeah.

01:31.154 --> 01:34.218
You, of course, are of great interest to me.

01:36.401 --> 01:42.769
You have had really two lives, it seems to me, in the world of books.

01:42.849 --> 01:54.885
You worked for the man who was acknowledged to be the greatest dealer of the 20th century, and then you've had a career here in an institutional standpoint, and you can really speak

01:55.726 --> 02:10.807
Well, I found that it was very interesting because over a period of time now, you see, I started at Rosenbach's in 1930.

02:10.987 --> 02:14.653
That is now 60 years ago.

02:14.873 --> 02:15.133
Wow.

02:16.355 --> 02:25.648
And I had known during that period of time most of the major rare book people in the country.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.643
There are a lot of private collectors I never knew.

02:28.683 --> 02:33.850
For instance, Huntington, Morgan, or... Well, that's right.

02:34.731 --> 02:38.896
I never knew them, and there's some more recent ones than that.

02:40.278 --> 02:49.930
On the other hand, I did know Frank Hogan, for instance, and the Hydes, both Donald and Mary, and so forth and so on.

02:49.950 --> 02:50.932
How about Bradley Martin?

02:51.332 --> 02:54.336
Bradley Martin I knew.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.062
Mrs. Doheny, I met.

02:56.082 --> 02:58.085
Mrs. Doheny, you mention in the book quite often.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.729
Yeah, I met, but that's all.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.694
I mean, I didn't really know Mrs. Doheny.

03:04.575 --> 03:10.684
John Fleming did most of the confrontation with the Countess.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.268
It was confrontation?

03:13.589 --> 03:17.655
Well, confrontation in the sense that... She granted audiences.

03:17.995 --> 03:19.918
Well, no, she...

03:21.113 --> 03:24.637
said, oh, sure, I'll look at it, but I'm not sure I'll buy it.

03:24.758 --> 03:26.480
Was she a collector or an accumulator?

03:27.321 --> 03:29.183
I think she may have been a collector.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.467
She had certain ideas.

03:32.607 --> 03:39.116
She collected things that had to do a couple of ways with religion.

03:39.816 --> 03:41.839
She was a very religious woman.

03:42.123 --> 03:44.405
She came from that kind of background, isn't it?

03:44.425 --> 03:45.866
Yes, very religious.

03:45.886 --> 03:48.308
Well, she left the whole lot to the diocese.

03:48.328 --> 03:52.412
To the diocese, and then the diocese, of course, sold it.

03:52.552 --> 04:00.059
But you can see in the older books that that was the thrust of her collecting.

04:00.739 --> 04:10.408
She also bought four-edge paintings, which is something that I never understand anybody buying more than one of.

04:11.266 --> 04:13.048
Because they're being made today.

04:14.230 --> 04:22.761
You take a nice old binding and you give it to one of the artists who specialize in the field of four-edge paintings, and there you are.

04:23.141 --> 04:26.185
Did she know her books as Bradley Martin?

04:27.326 --> 04:28.287
I doubt that.

04:28.307 --> 04:28.888
Or as Logan?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.490
As Logan, certainly.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.534
No, not the way Bradley Martin knew his.

04:34.015 --> 04:36.618
Bradley was verging on being a scholar by all of them.

04:36.638 --> 04:37.099
Oh, yes.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.822
I have been.

04:40.375 --> 04:45.744
in his Park Avenue apartment where the books were arranged.

04:46.105 --> 04:49.010
He knew where everything was, and he knew what they were.

04:49.030 --> 04:57.846
And he was a collector with really remarkable taste.

04:59.108 --> 05:03.295
Philadelphia, as I get into it, is really an extraordinary book city.

05:04.102 --> 05:07.926
It's really got a very noble, and I'm not just saying this, because I'm here.

05:08.027 --> 05:09.829
Certainly, I'm here because I want to write about it.

05:09.929 --> 05:11.070
It's important.

05:11.090 --> 05:16.036
But you have a triumvirate, it seems, of Logan, Franklin, and Rosenbach, just for openers.

05:16.276 --> 05:16.517
Yes.

05:16.537 --> 05:17.678
And then take it from there.

05:17.758 --> 05:20.862
And you have been, you have a connection with all of them.

05:21.262 --> 05:22.023
Sort of.

05:22.043 --> 05:22.764
Kind of.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.427
Maybe you can talk a little bit about that for a bit.

05:25.747 --> 05:27.670
Can I interrupt something later on, by the way?

05:27.690 --> 05:27.790
Sure.

05:27.810 --> 05:27.990
Go ahead.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.994
No, you were talking about knowing so many collectors over the years.

05:31.014 --> 05:33.957
Well, it's not only a question of collectors, but the...

05:34.274 --> 05:37.918
really great men in the field of libraries.

05:38.499 --> 05:42.524
Lawrence Roth, Clarence Brigham, Bill Jackson.

05:42.544 --> 05:53.076
I mean, these are people I had correspondence with, I knew, I had drinks with, you know, the whole business.

05:54.017 --> 05:58.182
And I am a little sorry.

05:58.302 --> 05:59.484
These were bookmen.

06:00.545 --> 06:04.129
I'm a little sorry that there's a trend away from

06:04.598 --> 06:20.222
librarians being bookmen, and they're now administrators and fundraisers and whatnot, but not the same thing as these... the older generation was.

06:20.583 --> 06:25.250
If you started in 1930, that would have made you a teenager, a mere... I was 18 years old.

06:25.290 --> 06:25.911
...a mere lad.

06:25.931 --> 06:27.373
18 years old.

06:27.493 --> 06:33.222
Was this just something that you kind of fell into, or did this represent a love for books and...

06:33.353 --> 06:35.696
I think I fell into it.

06:36.778 --> 06:39.742
I had been in school in England.

06:39.762 --> 06:45.431
I had decided that I'd learned enough and really didn't have to go to college.

06:46.733 --> 06:53.703
And my father was a friend and lawyer of the Rosenbachs.

06:53.723 --> 07:01.875
And he thought that Dr. Rosenbach's rare book business was the most glamorous thing in the world.

07:02.362 --> 07:07.790
This was almost the peak of doctor's newspaper fame.

07:09.012 --> 07:13.820
And so the doctor said, oh, sure, I'll take him on.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.882
And there I went.

07:14.962 --> 07:18.808
I had no skills to sell.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.193
So I figured I might just as well learn one.

07:22.634 --> 07:25.678
Well, I imagine you quickly learned to be a bibliographer.

07:26.059 --> 07:30.546
I learned to be a bibliographer and a cataloguer and so forth and so on.

07:30.813 --> 07:32.935
I bought a set of the Rosenbach catalogs.

07:32.955 --> 07:33.536
They're bound.

07:35.719 --> 07:36.279
Fascinating.

07:36.660 --> 07:41.566
You don't see dealers today buying such extraordinary things for general stock.

07:41.586 --> 07:46.191
If you see a dealer buying an auction today, it's usually because he has somebody he's buying for.

07:46.211 --> 07:46.631
Usually.

07:46.671 --> 07:48.554
You don't see general stock like that anymore.

07:48.894 --> 08:00.027
Well... Maybe you do, but... Not the width or breadth that the Rosenbachs had.

08:00.530 --> 08:04.536
from ninth century manuscripts to modern first editions.

08:06.339 --> 08:17.134
It is often, I've heard it said any number of times, and I know that as a collector, you don't necessarily mistrust, but you have reservations about the dealer who also is a collector.

08:17.755 --> 08:22.162
You somehow feel that perhaps, you know, he's pulling those things for himself.

08:22.382 --> 08:23.163
I mean, you feel that.

08:23.965 --> 08:29.052
Well, the doctor used to use that as a sales point.

08:29.656 --> 08:32.439
gosh, if you don't take this, I'm going to take it home myself.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.383
That kind of thing.

08:35.884 --> 08:41.831
And in fact, he did take a lot of books on there, still at the Rosenbach.

08:42.592 --> 08:49.700
But some of them are not the books that Dr. Rosenbach took home because he wanted.

08:49.901 --> 08:55.948
The Americana is, very definitely, because that's what he was most interested in.

08:57.009 --> 08:59.292
But some of the other things were

08:59.828 --> 09:06.855
what hadn't been sold when the company folded or went out of business when Philip Rosenbach died.

09:07.416 --> 09:19.548
We'll talk at some point about Philip, because mania is a word that we're going to have to explore in my book, and of course it's bibliomania, but you say in your book he had a mania to sell.

09:20.229 --> 09:25.655
He had a mania, well, he had a mania to buy, but it was furniture.

09:26.455 --> 09:28.958
Furniture and silver and things like that.

09:29.528 --> 09:42.581
And it was only at the sort of end when the doctor was unwell that Philip started saying, oh, well, we've got to get rid of all this.

09:42.781 --> 09:45.624
Yeah, you said he was consumed with a mania to sell.

09:45.684 --> 09:48.667
But it indicates that he really didn't have the passion for the books.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.789
He didn't know anything about the books.

09:50.809 --> 09:52.711
I mean, to him it was a product.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.873
It was something that you could turn into money.

09:55.894 --> 09:58.877
Well, an awful lot of what he had.

09:59.549 --> 10:02.073
was that.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.358
He was not a connoisseur.

10:05.938 --> 10:13.169
He wasn't even a connoisseur in the fields of furniture, fine arts, and so forth, which was his end of the business.

10:13.870 --> 10:17.736
The result was that part of the business never made money.

10:18.957 --> 10:23.464
The doctor made all the money and enabled his older brother to lose it.

10:23.815 --> 10:27.760
You'd almost think that his brother didn't appreciate this towards the end.

10:27.820 --> 10:33.907
I mean, the way he wouldn't allow these trips to England or... Well, that's right.

10:33.927 --> 10:42.057
Actually, from the book, it appears that you're very gentle, but you said the doctor finally said, I wonder what took you so long when you quit, finally.

10:42.157 --> 10:53.130
Well, I just wrote a little essay on Philip Rosenbach in which I discussed this.

10:53.667 --> 10:57.152
Where is this going to be published?

10:57.192 --> 10:58.754
In the minutes or the proceedings?

10:58.994 --> 11:03.941
I have no idea whether it will ever be published.

11:03.961 --> 11:11.172
I put, you know, some recollections down, put them in my computer.

11:12.393 --> 11:13.515
But this is about Philip.

11:13.855 --> 11:16.519
This is about Philip, and why.

11:17.022 --> 11:20.626
I would just assume that it's not an affectionate memoir.

11:20.906 --> 11:23.729
It is not an affectionate memoir, no.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.692
He was an amazing man.

11:25.712 --> 11:31.578
He had tremendous energy, most of it misdirected.

11:33.681 --> 11:46.675
The doctor, on the other hand, and we say, we talk about Philip with the purpose of illumining the doctor, because Philip had no feel for the book.

11:47.127 --> 11:50.670
If the doctor, in your words, what?

11:50.710 --> 11:51.671
He loved books.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.452
Did he have reverence?

11:52.492 --> 11:53.733
Did he have true reverence?

11:53.753 --> 11:54.553
He loved books.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.376
I mean, this was his life.

11:58.337 --> 12:05.783
And it was that enthusiasm which made him such a good salesman.

12:05.803 --> 12:08.546
I mean, here was something, and he knew about it.

12:09.226 --> 12:15.852
And as you know, you know from the book, the doctor business was an honest Ph.D.

12:16.642 --> 12:17.744
And he had read.

12:18.144 --> 12:19.606
That's a very important point.

12:19.626 --> 12:22.750
He read a great deal, and knew a great deal.

12:23.792 --> 12:27.056
And this, it was impressive.

12:28.078 --> 12:34.306
It was impressive, and he had a fantastic memory, as all good book men should have.

12:34.326 --> 12:36.009
All good book men should have, exactly.

12:36.269 --> 12:37.931
Fantastic memory.

12:39.554 --> 12:44.300
He, of course, in Books and Bitters, he diagrams his fascination.

12:44.340 --> 12:46.463
He outlines how he became the fascination.

12:47.236 --> 12:49.519
So you went to work in 1930.

12:49.659 --> 12:56.869
Would you have considered yourself, I hesitate to say, let's say a bibliophile, but he's not a bibliomaniac.

12:57.370 --> 13:01.696
Well, I would have, I suppose, I would have considered myself a bookman.

13:02.077 --> 13:04.720
It's a simpler word.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.002
Tell me what a bookman is.

13:06.062 --> 13:09.647
We've talked about it, and maybe in your words, so I can quote you.

13:09.667 --> 13:15.235
A bookman is somebody who has a knowledge of,

13:16.919 --> 13:25.790
how they're made, what their history is, what they're like, what's inside them.

13:25.810 --> 13:34.040
All those things combined together with a feeling for them.

13:34.060 --> 13:46.335
And that's a feeling for how they look, the type, the whiteness of the paper, the margins, the binding, all this, which is, I can only describe a sensuous feeling.

13:46.906 --> 13:48.207
They feel right.

13:50.630 --> 13:56.696
I was introduced to the 18th century when I was at school in England.

13:57.057 --> 13:58.198
Now, where did you study in England?

13:58.218 --> 14:03.203
At a school called B-Dales, B-E-D-A-L-E-S.

14:07.208 --> 14:16.778
The master in an English class was discussing the Augustans, among whom, of course, was swift.

14:18.108 --> 14:47.760
And he gave me an 18th century edition of two of Smith's, Swift's comic miscellaneous, which I read was introduced to the long S for the first time, but here was something that looked and smelled and had all the aura of the period.

14:48.432 --> 14:53.136
And that I found absolutely amazing.

14:54.297 --> 14:56.900
It started me collecting.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.402
I was a collector from the beginning.

14:59.422 --> 15:00.723
Well, I have a question here for you.

15:00.743 --> 15:01.864
Were you ever a collector?

15:01.964 --> 15:06.629
So you just, maybe you could just talk a little bit about, as you were talking about that, yeah.

15:07.510 --> 15:08.070
Yes, I started.

15:08.090 --> 15:10.092
In the context of talking about the Bookman.

15:10.112 --> 15:15.537
Well, I had collected all my life, from even before I went to...

15:16.225 --> 15:27.217
I thought I ought to buy an old book if I was going to work for them, so I bought a couple old books, and I started collecting along two lines.

15:28.778 --> 15:31.481
Modern First Editions, I picked all the wrong ones.

15:34.244 --> 15:37.828
So that was a mistake which I gave up.

15:38.128 --> 15:39.870
Who did you collect, for instance?

15:39.890 --> 15:42.493
Kipling, Shaw, Colesworth.

15:42.513 --> 15:44.255
Well, I mean, they're still collectible.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.097
They're still collectible, but...

15:46.702 --> 15:50.347
Who should you have collected, then?

15:50.387 --> 15:53.171
Who do you regret not having collected?

15:53.191 --> 15:55.615
Oh, well, I wouldn't collect moderns, anyway.

15:56.536 --> 16:01.924
I think it's...you don't...well, I wouldn't want to do it.

16:03.586 --> 16:13.080
I also collect...you see, I had to collect and have collected things that, first, the Rosenbachs wouldn't be interested in.

16:13.668 --> 16:18.574
And then things that the library guy wasn't competing with the library company.

16:19.455 --> 16:23.740
In other words, I, once upon a time, had some American imprints.

16:23.760 --> 16:31.870
When I came to the library company, I gave them to the library company, and I could buy American imprints thereafter.

16:31.890 --> 16:32.690
For yourself.

16:32.711 --> 16:33.391
For myself.

16:34.953 --> 16:43.303
I did have an idea from the very beginning of collecting 18th century books in old findings.

16:44.279 --> 16:50.989
And I was going to do what everybody or lots of people have done.

16:51.009 --> 16:56.277
The hundred books most likely to have been found in the colonial American library.

16:57.219 --> 16:59.843
The library company had copies of all of them.

16:59.923 --> 17:02.507
They had the whole hundred?

17:03.112 --> 17:05.335
It never became a formal list.

17:05.395 --> 17:07.278
It's like Lily trying to get the 100th.

17:07.298 --> 17:08.880
He has 99 of the glory of the 100th.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.702
Yeah, but you see that there is no list.

17:10.902 --> 17:11.583
There is no list.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.464
There is no list.

17:12.484 --> 17:14.067
But I think you could develop one.

17:15.108 --> 17:17.151
There is no list until somebody writes it.

17:17.171 --> 17:18.252
That's right.

17:18.272 --> 17:26.503
Well, I was collecting along those lines, and of course it got way beyond 100 after a comparatively

17:26.990 --> 17:28.772
Where did you hunt?

17:28.792 --> 17:29.333
Around here?

17:29.753 --> 17:30.074
No, no.

17:30.134 --> 17:44.230
I was buying mostly from catalogs in England at that time, but I bought them comparatively recently, and I had given them all to the library company.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.572
So they're here.

17:45.712 --> 17:46.473
That's great.

17:46.493 --> 17:49.937
They're going to be in this place eventually.

17:49.957 --> 17:50.257
Really?

17:50.618 --> 17:52.660
What's the name of the room we're in here, by the way?

17:52.680 --> 17:53.621
London.

17:53.641 --> 17:56.625
Of course.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.585
That's yours?

18:00.246 --> 18:07.976
It's all part of my life.

18:07.996 --> 18:09.518
I don't know why.

18:09.538 --> 18:12.381
It's a beautiful look at this one.

18:12.401 --> 18:17.107
Well, I had the whole thing to do with these.

18:17.127 --> 18:18.769
There's probably a hundred and fifty foot there.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.031
Oh, well.

18:20.213 --> 18:21.235
They're more than that.

18:21.635 --> 18:24.720
That's what condition has been on so far.

18:24.860 --> 18:28.687
Obviously condition was always a very important consideration.

18:28.767 --> 18:33.815
Well, I like to have contemporary bindings.

18:33.835 --> 18:36.820
And so you started, you said that's a fairly recent endeavor of yours.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.926
Yeah, until I gave it to the... Recent, like when, starting when?

18:41.968 --> 18:42.609
The 1950s?

18:42.870 --> 18:45.153
What, did I start buying those?

18:45.694 --> 18:47.537
1930s I started buying

18:53.474 --> 18:56.477
fairly recently.

18:58.199 --> 19:05.247
We moved from a rather large house to a small house, and I had shared books all over.

19:05.447 --> 19:07.009
It kills you, doesn't it?

19:07.029 --> 19:08.551
It did kill me.

19:08.571 --> 19:16.260
But these ended up... The library company, like the American Antiquarian Society, has a cutoff date.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.842
Yours is 1880, I guess, for what I'm providing.

19:18.862 --> 19:20.224
Well, approximately.

19:20.626 --> 19:21.427
Yeah.

19:21.447 --> 19:24.250
And the society goes to 76, I guess.

19:24.270 --> 19:25.191
But that helps.

19:25.211 --> 19:26.152
That really helps in your class.

19:26.232 --> 19:42.950
Well, you see, 1880 is the time when the library company was ensconced in its two buildings, which had then had one at the corner here of Juniper and Locust, and the other in South Philadelphia.

19:42.970 --> 19:47.655
And it marks, we left the old city, in other words.

19:48.836 --> 19:50.498
And that marks

19:51.136 --> 19:57.464
period in the library company's history, and I thought it was a reasonable date.

19:58.505 --> 20:08.017
Is there, um, we talked, to return to this, this concept of bibliomania, is there such a thing of institutional bibliomania, do you think?

20:09.059 --> 20:13.564
Uh, well, I, I suppose there... That's just something that came to me this morning in the airplane.

20:13.584 --> 20:18.831
Uh, I suppose there is, there are some institutions

20:19.587 --> 20:36.904
that have a policy of buying, I have a strong feeling that a collection which is not augmented becomes dead very quickly, because there isn't much interest in it.

20:37.485 --> 20:47.755
You see, you have to have the interest of the owner or the institutional director in a collection, or

20:48.899 --> 20:53.985
It becomes inhuman rather than humane.

20:54.446 --> 20:55.807
Isn't that interesting?

20:55.827 --> 20:59.732
Augmented in terms of... The being adding to it.

20:59.852 --> 21:00.393
Adding to it.

21:01.314 --> 21:10.825
I read where when you took over here, shortly after you left Rosenbach, that you were finding, quote, fresh discoveries on a daily basis.

21:10.845 --> 21:11.246
That's right.

21:11.266 --> 21:13.448
Things that people had forgotten were here.

21:13.609 --> 21:14.389
How did that happen?

21:14.790 --> 21:15.811
Because nobody cared.

21:16.412 --> 21:18.214
You know, that does happen.

21:19.038 --> 21:32.758
The library company, for many, many years before I got here, was spending most of its time, energy, and money on running a lending library, which is how it started, of course.

21:33.419 --> 21:39.749
But the deterioration, the quality of the books, was unbelievable.

21:41.171 --> 21:47.560
So being a lending library, while a noble thing to do, does not necessarily lend itself to

21:47.810 --> 21:49.132
stimulating scholarship.

21:49.472 --> 21:59.826
And besides, you see, by 1880 again, by then, there were many other libraries that were in business.

22:02.129 --> 22:02.630
Lending books?

22:03.130 --> 22:08.978
Well, no, building collections for research purposes.

22:09.078 --> 22:14.425
Another thesis that I'm exploring is the role of the collector in preserving history.

22:14.827 --> 22:18.392
And you can, you know, you think I'm stretching on that?

22:18.672 --> 22:21.095
No, no, no, I don't think you're stretching at all.

22:22.277 --> 22:23.799
Things which otherwise would be lost.

22:23.839 --> 22:29.025
You think of, to go to England, Pepys' wonderful library, which he ordered.

22:29.065 --> 22:31.589
Nothing is to be added, nothing is to be taken away.

22:31.609 --> 22:35.874
Consequently, you have a unique library of items that can be found.

22:36.615 --> 22:41.982
Francis Parkland going south after the Civil War to get these broadsides and almanacs, which...

22:42.451 --> 22:45.834
It makes, you know, the Athenaeum's creation preeminent.

22:45.854 --> 22:48.837
And again, these are extensions of what the collector is doing.

22:49.438 --> 22:59.167
And then you have these libraries, which I don't know if they're unique to the United States, but you have this, you have the Antiquarian Society, you have the Folger, you have the Huntington, you have the Morgan.

22:59.187 --> 23:02.110
All of which started because of a collector.

23:02.450 --> 23:02.931
That's right.

23:03.111 --> 23:07.836
But also, well, the library company didn't start because of a collector.

23:07.856 --> 23:11.479
It started because of the need for books.

23:11.763 --> 23:13.926
It is unique, isn't it, in this country?

23:14.626 --> 23:17.470
I hesitate to use the word unique, never use the word unique.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.412
No, well, it was different.

23:19.612 --> 23:20.173
It's different.

23:20.614 --> 23:21.194
It's different.

23:22.816 --> 23:27.602
The Redwood Library in Newport is done the same way.

23:27.642 --> 23:32.127
The various acronyms were started the same way.

23:32.147 --> 23:32.748
You mean as this?

23:33.209 --> 23:36.312
As this, yes, to provide books for its members.

23:39.116 --> 23:41.078
The library company was fortunate.

23:41.665 --> 23:49.572
in that while it had one fire, the damage was not very great, and the books were kept.

23:52.035 --> 23:54.937
I hate to say it, but largely because they weren't used.

23:55.218 --> 23:57.860
The old books, that is.

23:57.880 --> 24:09.451
And that's the reason for the survival almost intact of James Logan's library, which was really remarkable.

24:09.471 --> 24:11.453
You contrasted, say, to the cotton

24:12.108 --> 24:15.974
Robert Cotton's library in England, which was virtually destroyed in a fire.

24:16.435 --> 24:17.676
Right.

24:18.357 --> 24:24.847
Well, the Jefferson Library at the Library of Congress, which was largely, well, major.

24:24.867 --> 24:26.630
John Harvard's collection at Harvard, I think.

24:26.650 --> 24:30.856
They probably have three volumes they're stretching us, you know?

24:30.876 --> 24:31.457
Right.

24:31.477 --> 24:33.340
Speaking of Harvard, in your book,

24:33.927 --> 24:42.798
You mentioned, and this is something maybe we could talk about, you mentioned that Arthur Houghton was the preeminent collector of his day, one of the greatest collectors of his time.

24:42.818 --> 24:44.100
Right.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.041
And yet he stopped.

24:45.121 --> 24:46.323
He's still alive.

24:46.343 --> 24:48.446
He not only stopped, but he sold his books.

24:49.187 --> 24:49.487
Why?

24:49.687 --> 24:50.729
Do you have any idea?

24:51.149 --> 24:54.213
Don't ask me, because I have the vaguest idea.

24:54.654 --> 25:00.441
It seemed to me... As a young man, too, I mean, he did this fairly well.

25:00.927 --> 25:05.191
He wasn't thinking about the great beyond, let's put it that way.

25:05.211 --> 25:06.733
I don't think he was.

25:07.794 --> 25:10.017
And he certainly didn't need the money.

25:10.657 --> 25:12.379
Why did he give them to Harvard?

25:12.399 --> 25:13.720
He gave them a wonderful structure.

25:13.921 --> 25:16.163
Well, he gave them his teach things.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.185
He did not sell those.

25:19.026 --> 25:22.510
But, no, I don't understand why.

25:23.290 --> 25:29.517
I was at the sale at Christie's in London, and really,

25:30.880 --> 25:34.785
I couldn't figure out why Arthur Hogan sold the books.

25:34.926 --> 25:35.747
Did you ever ask him?

25:36.268 --> 25:36.488
No.

25:38.471 --> 25:41.515
Did it come as a surprise when you heard that he was going to sell the books?

25:41.535 --> 25:42.576
Yes, very definitely.

25:43.297 --> 25:44.419
Very definitely.

25:44.439 --> 25:48.825
Because he was an enthusiastic collector.

25:49.546 --> 25:57.377
I mean, when he started collecting and when he and the doctor sat around drinking,

25:57.577 --> 26:00.381
He was really an enthusiastic collector.

26:00.681 --> 26:02.404
He, too, knew what he was buying.

26:02.564 --> 26:04.647
He had great taste.

26:04.727 --> 26:05.287
Exquisite taste.

26:05.307 --> 26:07.090
Great, yeah.

26:07.110 --> 26:24.954
No, he was a... He was one of the people I took to him, some of the chapters of Rosenbach, because I wanted him to read it and see what he thought of it.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.436
Is he a fairly accessible man?

26:26.737 --> 26:27.558
He was then.

26:27.658 --> 26:30.221
I don't know how accessible he is now.

26:31.042 --> 26:32.984
I mean, he was accessible to me then.

26:33.584 --> 26:35.106
How old would you say he is right now?

26:35.727 --> 26:41.973
I think he's just a little bit older than I am, which would make him very close to 80.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.318
I'm curious to see if he'd talk to me.

26:48.420 --> 26:50.022
Look him up and know who's who.

26:50.042 --> 26:54.567
I figured I'd do that, yeah.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.783
Very, very close to it one way or another.

26:58.803 --> 27:00.566
You don't know where he lives offhand.

27:00.727 --> 27:03.932
I think he lives in Maryland at the Y Plantation.

27:05.655 --> 27:08.279
I am sure he has an apartment in New York.

27:08.299 --> 27:11.103
I'm asking this, because I'll get that for sure.

27:11.143 --> 27:14.349
I'm sure he has an apartment in New York.

27:14.489 --> 27:18.335
But he just...there has been a Houghton Library, I think, since 1941.

27:18.455 --> 27:22.562
So we're talking 50 years.

27:22.897 --> 27:26.722
He was about 29, 30 years old when he did that.

27:27.923 --> 27:31.027
He was very young.

27:32.689 --> 27:41.740
Some people say that they are as interested in why some people stopped collecting equally as interested in why they started.

27:41.921 --> 27:44.163
Harrison Horner was another one.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.387
He remained interested in photography, I guess.

27:47.828 --> 27:51.132
They just had an exhibit at the Houghton Library on this Thomas Phillips stuff.

27:51.888 --> 27:53.850
But yet, he's... Jerome Curran.

27:53.890 --> 27:55.412
Of course, I think Jerome wanted the money.

27:55.613 --> 27:58.316
Yeah, I think he may have needed the money.

27:59.237 --> 28:03.142
I gather that Harrison didn't need the money either.

28:03.643 --> 28:04.484
I wonder what happens.

28:04.564 --> 28:06.766
Do you have a window in that?

28:07.007 --> 28:09.450
I really don't have a window.

28:09.570 --> 28:19.262
I would say that, well, in Harrison's case, he started collecting something else.

28:20.120 --> 28:32.131
Now, not of the quality of the things that he had been collecting, but still it may have been in his instance when he gave up his boat.

28:32.171 --> 28:37.616
He used to sail a great deal, and I think he stopped doing that.

28:37.656 --> 28:47.085
And since his collection had a nautical flavor, it could have been that.

28:47.906 --> 28:50.008
How do you feel to jump around

28:50.360 --> 29:02.454
We have the example of Bradley Martin, and I guess we've talked about, there has been considerable discussion about that recently, the finest ornithological collection of private hands, arguably one of the finest anywhere.

29:03.215 --> 29:13.726
Why didn't he, his family didn't need the money, we're talking about the Bessemer Trust, why did he not make plans to send it to an institution?

29:15.749 --> 29:18.612
Not that you would know, but I guess

29:18.980 --> 29:25.452
There are some people who have a feeling they enjoyed collecting.

29:26.253 --> 29:34.729
Once books go into an institution, no individual enjoys those books in the same fashion again.

29:36.592 --> 29:41.100
Some people want to have a library with their name on.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.743
Some don't care.

29:43.381 --> 29:50.788
Robert Ho is said to have said, it's in Beverly Chew's introduction to the catalogs, which I have, is that where would I be if it weren't for other collectors?

29:50.849 --> 29:51.409
That's right.

29:51.950 --> 29:54.032
And there's a lot to be said for that, I guess.

29:54.092 --> 29:54.312
Right.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.974
And I guess, how do you feel?

29:56.014 --> 30:03.842
You've been in the institution as the director of an institution who would love to get a preeminent library.

30:04.162 --> 30:05.563
You'd say, gee, I'd love to get that library.

30:05.724 --> 30:08.106
But then on the other hand, as one who worked with Rosenbach,

30:08.542 --> 30:13.529
You'd say, gee, I'd like to get this... Well, I have done... Do you have a duality of feelings on this?

30:13.549 --> 30:16.954
I have a duality of feelings and a duality of action.

30:18.156 --> 30:19.478
Perhaps you could expand on that.

30:19.498 --> 30:26.768
When I had to get rid of books when we moved, I both gave away and sold.

30:28.210 --> 30:29.292
You're talking about you personally.

30:29.973 --> 30:30.954
Me personally.

30:31.495 --> 30:37.063
So that this was six of one, half a dozen of another, really.

30:38.208 --> 30:52.122
And I had inherited and added to a collection from my father of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton material.

30:52.903 --> 30:58.049
And half of it has already been sold at Christie's in London.

30:58.849 --> 31:00.531
The other half will be sold.

31:00.691 --> 31:06.257
Well, I might have given that away if I could have.

31:06.760 --> 31:13.891
figured any place in this country that really was a logical place.

31:14.011 --> 31:14.693
I couldn't.

31:17.237 --> 31:19.019
The Naval Academy?

31:19.560 --> 31:21.543
No, they wouldn't care.

31:21.824 --> 31:22.885
They wouldn't care.

31:23.627 --> 31:24.648
No, I don't.

31:25.309 --> 31:33.983
I gave a good deal of thought to that, and really couldn't think of a logical thing, and I did not feel

31:34.520 --> 31:43.730
I wanted to give it to the British Library, where it would have been appropriate, or to Greenwich, where it might have been appropriate.

31:43.750 --> 31:46.233
Well, if they want it badly enough now, they can buy it, I guess.

31:46.253 --> 31:49.497
Well, I doubt that they bought much of it.

31:49.517 --> 31:57.246
That's a very fascinating story that you have in the book on Yale and the Besson book.

31:58.307 --> 32:01.050
That's a fascinating... I mean, I find...

32:02.026 --> 32:17.026
that really... Well, I can tell you now, when I wrote that up, I wrote it from everything I'd been told by everybody.

32:17.046 --> 32:26.419
I sent a copy to Jim Babb, and he was furious.

32:27.921 --> 32:31.105
He felt that I had put too much of John's

32:32.131 --> 32:36.255
Fleming's story in, and too little of his.

32:36.996 --> 32:41.079
Well, did you give him an opportunity to... And I gave him an opportunity.

32:41.140 --> 32:47.606
Well, what appeared in the book was the third rewrite.

32:49.968 --> 33:01.699
We had an umpire in this, and I was working through Fritz Liebert after the initial.

33:03.097 --> 33:23.348
And, you see, the original story that I had gotten that Jim objected to was that John said when he was bidding in the book, Jim Babs said to him, you've got to get this for me, it's worth my job.

33:27.434 --> 33:29.717
He said that didn't happen.

33:29.737 --> 33:30.859
John said it did happen.

33:31.615 --> 33:34.742
And why would John have done it otherwise?

33:35.043 --> 33:40.195
Well, there were a couple things that made it.

33:41.077 --> 33:47.633
If Mrs. Harkness had not withdrawn, they would have come awful close to having the money.

33:48.457 --> 33:55.024
And then again, I guess it was a terrific amount of money in those days, but you look at the figures, you know, it's no big deal.

33:55.264 --> 33:55.624
Nothing.

33:55.644 --> 33:57.806
I mean, the thing should have been able to be resolved.

33:57.987 --> 33:58.367
Oh, sure.

33:58.387 --> 33:58.888
You think so.

33:58.928 --> 34:02.351
You're dealing with people to whom this is not a lot of money in any case.

34:02.391 --> 34:02.852
That's right.

34:03.752 --> 34:04.233
That's right.

34:04.593 --> 34:13.662
No, it was, well, it was an aberration, but it was the highest price an American book had ever fetched.

34:13.723 --> 34:16.185
A printed book, yeah.

34:17.279 --> 34:26.190
Well, I was at the Garden Limited Sale in November, where Dick Manny spent $2 million for these Shakespeare's, and they're really not the finest.

34:26.531 --> 34:28.293
I mean, they're nice.

34:28.313 --> 34:32.538
There are four, and they've got a pretty nice provenance.

34:32.578 --> 34:35.522
But Krauss was offering them 15 years ago for $165,000.

34:35.642 --> 34:41.149
We're talking about geometric progressions.

34:41.169 --> 34:41.710
That's right.

34:42.030 --> 34:44.333
And the increments on the bids were,

34:44.482 --> 34:45.964
$50,000 a pop.

34:45.984 --> 34:46.785
It opened at $5.

34:46.825 --> 34:47.847
It goes to $5.56.

34:47.967 --> 34:48.547
I was there.

34:48.567 --> 34:49.989
I taped it.

34:50.009 --> 34:52.713
$50,000 is what Ho paid for Gutenberg.

34:52.913 --> 34:56.939
Well, that's a long time ago.

34:57.039 --> 34:58.821
But what do you think when you see prices like this?

34:58.941 --> 35:00.183
It probably doesn't surprise you.

35:00.203 --> 35:04.028
Maybe it's just... No, I have a very good answer for that.

35:04.629 --> 35:05.911
Money isn't worth anything.

35:07.513 --> 35:07.954
Books are.

35:08.414 --> 35:09.055
Books are.

35:09.676 --> 35:12.621
Well, the same thing's true in paintings, only worse.

35:13.102 --> 35:18.611
Well, except the Japanese spent $20 million for de Koonin, a painting by a living artist.

35:18.991 --> 35:35.599
Yeah, well, it doesn't make any sense at all to me, but you know there are areas in the book where I now am collecting something different, and I'm putting out

35:39.697 --> 35:45.985
Victorian, fancy American Victorian bonding.

35:46.005 --> 35:47.126
So it's in your blood, right?

35:47.327 --> 35:48.348
Well, you know.

35:48.528 --> 35:49.589
What's the kick for you?

35:49.990 --> 36:00.002
The kick for me is, even when I was here, is to start collecting in a field that nobody else is interested in.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.244
Make it fashionable.

36:02.365 --> 36:09.214
Get yourself a pretty damn good collection

36:09.835 --> 36:12.838
before the prices go up.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.822
And also while the titles are available, you mean?

36:15.962 --> 36:22.849
I started here collecting black history when it was still called Negro History.

36:22.869 --> 36:23.951
This was for yourself or for the library?

36:23.971 --> 36:24.912
For the library company.

36:27.915 --> 36:30.778
Now, give me a sense of the transference.

36:30.818 --> 36:38.847
Now, you were here collecting for the library, applying your knowledge, your skill as a bookman, your background.

36:39.147 --> 36:41.970
But did you get as much of a kick out of the acquisition?

36:42.871 --> 36:43.231
Here?

36:43.311 --> 36:43.591
Yeah.

36:43.932 --> 36:45.193
Oh, yes, certainly.

36:47.675 --> 36:52.700
See, that's part of what I'm saying, institutional bibliomania in a way.

36:52.720 --> 37:00.968
Well, I had become, you know, the collector, me and the library company.

37:01.768 --> 37:04.551
I love that phrase that you used to describe yourself.

37:04.631 --> 37:05.712
I've got to find it.

37:06.063 --> 37:09.687
Oh, well, I didn't.

37:09.707 --> 37:11.088
That was somebody else.

37:12.049 --> 37:13.791
Bibliotecarius.

37:15.833 --> 37:22.881
That's because we didn't have any computers then, and we didn't do a lot of things.

37:24.883 --> 37:26.465
We had a card catalog.

37:26.525 --> 37:31.390
We had all kinds of things, and everybody was telling me, oh, well, that's old-fashioned.

37:31.490 --> 37:34.213
I said, well, you'll find that it works.

37:34.312 --> 37:39.618
Well, I'm doing a lot of my research at the Widener at Harvard, and it's amazing.

37:39.678 --> 37:43.803
Even I can't believe you just go and you type in a key word in a computer.

37:45.204 --> 37:46.025
That's right.

37:46.045 --> 37:48.908
We're talking 11 million books, you know, at the Widener.

37:48.928 --> 37:57.638
Well, it took me a while to get myself a personal computer, a word processor.

37:58.279 --> 38:02.023
And I must say, I use it all the time.

38:02.425 --> 38:04.447
I don't know what I did before.

38:04.467 --> 38:05.188
What did you get?

38:05.528 --> 38:07.690
I got an Epsom.

38:07.710 --> 38:08.912
What's the software?

38:10.373 --> 38:10.773
Word.

38:11.474 --> 38:11.855
Good.

38:11.875 --> 38:12.595
Excellent.

38:13.897 --> 38:14.617
Well, it works.

38:14.838 --> 38:21.344
I mean, it works for me and saves an unbelievable amount of time.

38:22.025 --> 38:25.168
You've given me some wonderful information.

38:25.208 --> 38:30.053
How about people you think I should be talking to for this book if I look interested in collectors?

38:30.353 --> 38:39.346
The flavor, the ambiance of book collecting, in your experience, I'm trying to hit as many as I can.

38:39.366 --> 38:45.334
I get David Kirchenbaum, which I think is just a marvelous hit, you know, to get David.

38:46.776 --> 38:47.917
It's a strange thing.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.923
I just don't know many collectors now.

38:52.342 --> 38:53.303
Well, book people.

38:53.383 --> 38:57.929
Well, book people, yes, you talk to Marcus McHarrison, of course.

38:57.949 --> 39:13.727
Of course, and Marcus started at Harvard, and I'll be going down to see Mr. Scheide and Dave Kirshenbaum, as I mentioned, Rostenberg and Stern, these two women in New York who might have some—I haven't talked to them yet, but I think they might have some cute stories.

39:13.747 --> 39:14.468
Right.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.937
Just in case, I've talked to Nicholas Parker already.

39:17.957 --> 39:19.959
Have you talked to Mary Benjamin?

39:19.979 --> 39:21.361
No, who's Mary Benjamin?

39:21.381 --> 39:23.724
Mary Benjamin's in the autograph business.

39:24.165 --> 39:25.066
She has been mentioned.

39:25.086 --> 39:26.527
You have a second one.

39:26.708 --> 39:30.112
She is a remor... I haven't seen her for years.

39:30.132 --> 39:32.515
This is her uncle's business or something?

39:33.015 --> 39:34.237
She's in New York someplace.

39:34.958 --> 39:41.586
I haven't seen her for years, but she was absolutely great.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.563
Eugene Field, who's speaking of Mary Benjamin and Rostenberg and Stern.

39:47.004 --> 39:49.366
I mean, you do mention Amy Lowell in your book, by the way.

39:49.446 --> 39:51.048
She's quite an interesting person.

39:52.549 --> 39:55.672
It has been, I think, women have been unfairly maligned.

39:55.872 --> 39:59.216
Well, have you talked to Mary Hyde?

39:59.916 --> 40:00.817
I haven't, no.

40:01.057 --> 40:03.940
Well, you know, she's a lady, you know, what's her name?

40:05.562 --> 40:06.142
Where is she?

40:07.083 --> 40:12.248
Well, she's in New York, and she's in London, and she's in New Jersey.

40:12.768 --> 40:14.090
What's her name?

40:14.491 --> 40:14.971
God.

40:17.776 --> 40:18.958
She's Viscountess.

40:19.498 --> 40:19.879
She is?

40:20.640 --> 40:21.722
She married me.

40:23.725 --> 40:24.706
A major collector?

40:25.688 --> 40:27.010
She is a major.

40:28.052 --> 40:29.894
She is a major collector.

40:30.756 --> 40:35.703
She has the finest Johnson collection, the finest Oscar Wilde collection.

40:35.723 --> 40:36.304
Really?

40:36.324 --> 40:36.925
Yeah.

40:36.945 --> 40:37.106
Oh.

40:38.127 --> 40:38.708
I didn't know her.

40:39.143 --> 40:40.244
Well, I don't know her.

40:40.324 --> 40:41.346
I don't know her.

40:41.366 --> 40:42.987
This is the first I'm learning of her.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.389
Yeah, it's a black hole for me.

40:44.409 --> 40:44.990
I don't know her.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.872
Oh, well, I'm amazed at that.

40:47.753 --> 40:49.795
Well, I'm in the early stages of the research.

40:49.996 --> 41:02.951
Yeah, but I mean, she is... That's why I ask for... She is... She and Donald Hyde, her husband, who was a lawyer, started collecting books, and Don died.

41:03.972 --> 41:06.535
He was president of Glow Your Club, among other things.

41:07.358 --> 41:12.744
And Eccles, Viscountess Eccles, E-C-C-L-E-S.

41:13.425 --> 41:16.228
Viscountess Eccles, isn't that something?

41:16.248 --> 41:20.613
And her husband is David Eccles.

41:20.873 --> 41:28.823
I mean, you don't call him a Viscount Lord Eccles.

41:29.223 --> 41:29.844
You know them?

41:29.864 --> 41:31.786
Oh, yeah, sure I know them.

41:31.806 --> 41:37.112
I've known her since she was an early customer of Rosenbach.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.962
Was she a collector?

41:38.982 --> 41:40.564
She was both a collector.

41:41.285 --> 41:49.075
She was doing getting her doctoral, writing a doctoral thesis on Jacobean plays.

41:50.737 --> 41:57.386
And she has written two very well-received books on Mrs. Thrail.

41:57.707 --> 41:57.987
Really?

41:58.047 --> 41:59.189
Under the name of Mary Hyde?

41:59.389 --> 42:00.791
Under the name of Mary Hyde.

42:00.811 --> 42:03.154
I'll check it out.

42:03.174 --> 42:07.099
But she is a major...

42:07.349 --> 42:10.513
A living male collector.

42:10.654 --> 42:11.615
A major one.

42:12.737 --> 42:14.920
I'm going to have a section on women collectors, I think.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.041
And she knows.

42:19.386 --> 42:22.310
There were other women collectors.

42:22.370 --> 42:24.754
Well, the Groyer, you mentioned the Groyer, is going to have a show.

42:25.054 --> 42:26.056
I think next month.

42:26.076 --> 42:26.736
That's right.

42:26.756 --> 42:28.900
And Marie Corrie is putting it together.

42:29.260 --> 42:31.864
And Ruth Mortimer from Smith, I guess.

42:31.884 --> 42:33.646
The two of them are doing it.

42:33.666 --> 42:34.928
I've talked to Bob Nightkirk.

42:34.948 --> 42:36.310
Well, I'll get, believe me,

42:36.543 --> 42:37.965
That's why I ask.

42:38.245 --> 42:40.868
There's always a name that somebody else has forgotten to give me.

42:41.369 --> 42:41.829
Mary Hyde.

42:41.849 --> 42:45.654
I think Mary Hyde is vice president of the Glowier Club now.

42:45.854 --> 42:48.597
You see we have that circled here several times.

42:49.138 --> 42:52.361
She is a major figure.

42:53.843 --> 42:54.584
That's wonderful.

42:54.604 --> 42:57.848
I talked to Tom Tanzel at the Glowier Club.

42:58.468 --> 43:01.712
He's very supportive of my project as well.

43:02.593 --> 43:04.255
I'm just going to...

43:06.732 --> 43:07.673
a little bit about Logan.

43:09.114 --> 43:12.397
That's a great book, by the way, which he did.

43:13.538 --> 43:25.089
And maybe we can, I think, to give us some historical perspective, he really is a giant in American books, in a history of American books.

43:25.169 --> 43:35.679
There's no doubt about it, because he knew more about the insides of more different kinds of books than any other American colonial times.

43:36.080 --> 43:36.520
Amazing.

43:36.854 --> 43:40.139
And when you think of what he had to go through to get books.

43:40.339 --> 43:42.322
Well, he ordered them from England.

43:42.342 --> 43:47.028
I mean, this is the, well, England, Germany, Holland.

43:47.549 --> 43:49.632
He got them all kinds of ways.

43:51.234 --> 43:57.984
But he also annotated, which is the fascinating part of his library.

43:58.665 --> 44:02.190
And he was implacable.

44:02.590 --> 44:03.992
Somebody made a mistake.

44:05.727 --> 44:07.729
The marginal note points it out.

44:07.829 --> 44:08.290
No kidding?

44:09.231 --> 44:10.532
So he was a brilliant man, would you say?

44:10.552 --> 44:11.513
He was a brilliant man?

44:11.893 --> 44:13.815
Yeah, I would say he was a very brilliant man.

44:14.056 --> 44:32.815
I mean, anybody who, by himself, at the beginning of the discovery, could teach himself calculus, he is the only American I know who wrote a classical textual

44:34.178 --> 44:46.974
study, which was published in a Dutch scholarly periodical at the beginning of the 18th century, but a textual study.

44:49.697 --> 44:51.720
It's amazing to me.

44:52.501 --> 44:56.145
Now, did you find this stuff out here?

44:56.165 --> 45:03.274
Well, I mean, as you were basically cataloging his stuff?

45:03.440 --> 45:06.043
as I was pulling it off the shelves.

45:06.163 --> 45:11.028
How did you become, how you came to learn about Logan?

45:11.048 --> 45:14.332
There was a whole... Yeah, that's fine.

45:14.352 --> 45:14.912
Go ahead.

45:14.932 --> 45:22.120
There was a whole balcony in the old building that was the Logan collection.

45:22.901 --> 45:27.526
And going into this, what did you know, how much did you know about Logan?

45:27.766 --> 45:28.287
Very little.

45:28.967 --> 45:32.451
I mean... So this was really an assignment, this was something

45:32.954 --> 45:34.817
This was discovery for you as much as anybody else.

45:34.837 --> 45:35.177
That's right.

45:35.197 --> 45:37.341
As much as it was work and cataloging.

45:37.842 --> 45:43.010
I started pulling those books down, and they were such fabulous books.

45:43.871 --> 45:52.024
I mean, to think that these were here in this country and had been used, you see.

45:53.746 --> 46:00.717
I also worked at one time in picking up a little bit on books from Franklin's Library.

46:01.473 --> 46:09.703
Well, it's very difficult to know what books he used, unless he specifically said he used them, frankly.

46:11.045 --> 46:16.171
You can't tell from the books the way you can with the Logan books.

46:16.191 --> 46:23.801
Well, of course, today, and who knows when this started, you don't want it to face a book.

46:23.821 --> 46:26.184
You know, like in writing books, I certainly don't.

46:26.204 --> 46:29.708
Well, you don't want it to face a book, but...

46:29.941 --> 46:34.166
Only when he becomes Logan, you know, that you simply have his annotations in there.

46:34.186 --> 46:35.888
Well, you see, it just depends.

46:37.250 --> 46:54.852
I don't annotate books very much, but I have annotated a couple, where I feel, you know, I have added considerably to what it... Well, you come to it as a scholar, too, as somebody who has knowledge...

46:55.355 --> 47:02.364
of the subject that nobody else has, and so that does make that a synergistic kind of a thing, where you're adding something.

47:02.765 --> 47:05.688
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

47:05.708 --> 47:12.958
But, no, I was attracted to Logan because he was a curmudgeon.

47:14.260 --> 47:23.371
He was quite unpopular in the democratic... For political reasons.

47:23.411 --> 47:24.653
For political reasons.

47:25.561 --> 47:31.127
He wrote... He was aloof, I think, intellectually aloof too, wasn't he?

47:31.147 --> 47:40.656
Well, he found very few people that he thought were his intellectual equal.

47:41.818 --> 47:53.830
And there were a few, but not many, but he was very kind to some of them who were quite humble, like John Bartram.

47:54.535 --> 48:19.345
And Godfrey, who went on and developed a better quadrant, Mariner's quadrant, but he was very good to them, because he thought they had native intelligence, not academic intelligence, but native intelligence, and could learn.

48:20.388 --> 48:23.031
And there were a number of other people.

48:23.391 --> 48:28.636
His quotes on books, though, just on what books mean to him are, you know, every one is quotable.

48:28.696 --> 48:32.139
I mean, I intend to use any number of them in my own study.

48:32.159 --> 48:40.447
I mean, this is a guy who I would imagine the big thing about coming to this country was the fact that he wouldn't have easy access to his books.

48:40.507 --> 48:42.449
I mean, I would think that's the one thing that's right.

48:42.889 --> 48:48.775
Well, he sold his library, his first library, which I found hard to believe.

48:49.362 --> 48:54.992
with 700 volumes for somebody not quite 20.

48:56.094 --> 48:58.658
That's a lot of books in those days.

48:58.678 --> 48:59.219
For anybody.

48:59.239 --> 49:02.705
700 books today for anybody that age.

49:02.725 --> 49:02.906
Right.

49:04.769 --> 49:05.370
Unusual.

49:05.470 --> 49:05.971
Unusual.

49:06.612 --> 49:13.885
But anyway, let's return to this process of discovery on your part, taking this stuff off and going through.

49:14.489 --> 49:18.794
and what you learned about the guy and how you came to appreciate it, I guess.

49:18.814 --> 49:19.214
Yeah.

49:19.234 --> 49:20.276
You were talking about that.

49:21.757 --> 49:22.658
You were talking about that.

49:22.718 --> 49:23.039
Oh, yeah.

49:23.139 --> 49:39.457
Well, the more I saw, the more amazed I was at his virtuosity and the fact that books are my disease, he said.

49:40.618 --> 49:42.100
And they were indeed.

49:43.345 --> 49:59.463
And as he withdrew more and more from active politics and business in the 1740s, he turned more to books.

49:59.484 --> 50:11.277
And this is when you get those big orders of books from England, one thing after another, and this complaint because he collated the book and it was missing something,

50:11.493 --> 50:16.198
It was in bad shape and he sent it back and complained about the price.

50:16.239 --> 50:17.320
He could get one cheaper.

50:17.340 --> 50:18.481
And you found all this stuff here?

50:19.022 --> 50:20.984
Found it all, yeah.

50:21.004 --> 50:24.969
And it was just lying here for centuries, really.

50:25.049 --> 50:29.254
Waiting your... Waiting somebody to come say, gee gosh.

50:29.354 --> 50:31.296
But that's what a collection is all about, isn't it?

50:31.677 --> 50:35.821
We don't know when it's going to be, when it's going to come forth and reveal itself.

50:35.941 --> 50:39.846
Well, you know, it wasn't only the Logan books, of course.

50:40.180 --> 50:44.706
There were all kinds of things that the library companies... No, it wasn't apathy, was it?

50:44.726 --> 50:49.633
Was it apathy that allowed the stuff to kind of... To a certain extent, yes.

50:51.335 --> 50:58.686
The directors of the library company really didn't care about old books.

51:01.289 --> 51:06.897
And the librarians really didn't care about old books.

51:07.838 --> 51:11.832
all the way through the 19th century.

51:11.852 --> 51:15.705
How do Logan's books... I'm going to just turn the tape on the other side before...
