00:02.393 --> 00:03.515
You've done it, and it's wonderful.

00:03.655 --> 00:04.476
Congratulations.

00:04.496 --> 00:05.778
Thanks.

00:06.379 --> 00:11.847
I read someplace that you actually drew a lot of this earlier draft.

00:12.108 --> 00:12.629
Yeah, I did.

00:12.649 --> 00:18.417
I worked on it for a long time, and basically there's nothing left over from the 250 pages but three letters.

00:18.898 --> 00:19.339
Really?

00:19.359 --> 00:20.100
Yeah.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.482
What was there about that?

00:21.901 --> 00:23.624
It was so different.

00:23.664 --> 00:26.608
I mean, it ended up being a completely different novel.

00:26.668 --> 00:33.157
It was initially a novel about two women, and I mean... Same title?

00:33.838 --> 00:35.421
No, had no title.

00:35.501 --> 00:36.522
Had no title at all.

00:37.924 --> 00:40.488
But it just didn't take off.

00:40.548 --> 00:50.743
I mean, it just didn't have any momentum of its own, and the only thing that seemed interesting was that I had set up this epistolary form, the interjection of the letters in that,

00:50.875 --> 01:00.488
And, of all things, I really did just pluck a few of those letters from that draft and managed to create a new character for them and put them in the second draft.

01:00.528 --> 01:05.796
So, my sense then is you started with the form before you had... Well, I didn't really... Before you were committed to the form.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.680
I mean, now I'm going to really sound dizzy, but I didn't really start with anything.

01:08.720 --> 01:12.385
But, you know, having arrived at that... You normally don't start with anything either, I think.

01:12.705 --> 01:13.086
No.

01:13.623 --> 01:24.740
No, I mean, I've gotten used to myself to the extent now that I know that it's pretty impossible for me to write something that doesn't have some sort of an alternative narrative within the main narrative.

01:25.180 --> 01:37.639
You know, it just seems to me that, I mean, maybe this is a result of having written more books than I used to have written, but it's very hard for me to write anything and say, this is the way it is.

01:37.889 --> 01:49.211
So at least suggesting that there's one other whole possibility, one other whole route to explore within the context of what is, at least personally makes me feel more comfortable with the text.

01:49.231 --> 01:53.619
Are you satisfied with the epistolary device that you use?

01:54.320 --> 01:56.725
Explain to me why it's necessary.

01:56.907 --> 01:57.989
Why it's necessary?

01:58.069 --> 02:03.078
Well, one of the... I don't know if she had a problem with that, otherwise, in the New York Times, but loved the book.

02:03.098 --> 02:03.559
Uh-huh.

02:03.639 --> 02:05.101
Did you get another review?

02:05.201 --> 02:06.945
She wrote an essentially wonderful review.

02:06.965 --> 02:08.046
Yeah, I thought it was wonderful.

02:08.167 --> 02:08.427
Yeah.

02:09.329 --> 02:18.164
Well, the reason why I did it was that I couldn't... The past has so much to do with the present in this book, and there really are two stories.

02:18.184 --> 02:19.827
One happens back then...

02:20.110 --> 02:32.605
and remains ambiguous because even the people who were involved back then don't necessarily know what the other person knew, know it incompletely, know it from a skewed perspective, or have reason not to reveal it or whatever.

02:32.685 --> 02:36.069
But I couldn't have in the present my character having flashbacks.

02:36.149 --> 02:41.055
I particularly couldn't have the character having flashbacks to something he didn't even know.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.944
I think, in a way, I thought it was sort of like real life.

02:45.225 --> 03:01.546
I mean, I know that, in effect, at the end of the day, we don't get an italicized section interjecting something, but in a comparable way, I think, you know, if you keep looking at photographs through the years, they mean something different to you at 50 than they meant at 25.

03:01.887 --> 03:06.873
You pick up details that are suddenly anachronistic that looked okay when you looked at the picture 25 years ago.

03:07.314 --> 03:09.777
That sense, too, I think, of

03:10.027 --> 03:17.836
the interrelationship of the past and the future, I thought I would put there almost as documentary evidence, the same way somebody might look at a photo album.

03:17.936 --> 03:24.283
Do you think this is the type of book that you could only write at this stage in your career, in your development?

03:24.303 --> 03:26.045
I think probably that's true.

03:26.346 --> 03:28.008
Mid-40s kind of a book.

03:28.468 --> 03:32.693
I don't think that this was the kind of book you'd have written in 1975.

03:32.853 --> 03:33.634
No, I don't think so.

03:33.654 --> 03:38.700
I mean, I have to agree with critics when they say that it was more difficult to

03:39.035 --> 03:42.420
understand what the conclusion was.

03:42.760 --> 03:48.288
I mean, at the end of this book, I think part of the conclusion is that the past remains ambiguous, certainly.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.130
The past remains uncertain.

03:50.471 --> 03:55.578
But merely the idea that that's a constant point of reference, I think, is something I see more as I get older.

03:55.618 --> 03:56.239
That's right.

03:56.259 --> 03:58.362
We become more aware of this.

03:58.382 --> 04:02.287
The closer we get to the past, the less we understand it, it seems.

04:02.828 --> 04:04.350
I don't know if that's fair.

04:05.073 --> 04:06.955
Well, I know even when I see my parents now.

04:06.995 --> 04:14.721
You know, I mean, I have the, I remember now, which I didn't remember even like 10 years ago or something, being a young person with my parents.

04:14.761 --> 04:20.686
My parents, and it's not just that my parents are younger, it's almost as though I have an aerial view and I can remember myself at different stages with them.

04:20.946 --> 04:24.729
And, of course, our relationship necessarily is so different now that we're at these ages.

04:24.749 --> 04:26.211
So it's like you're seeing it as an observer now.

04:26.231 --> 04:27.772
Exactly, exactly.

04:27.792 --> 04:28.272
That's fascinating.

04:28.292 --> 04:28.453
Yeah.

04:28.953 --> 04:34.658
I read also that you're going to step away from, now this is the first novel in, what, five years, I think it is, right?

04:34.678 --> 04:34.818
Mm-hmm.

04:34.838 --> 04:34.978
Mm-hmm.

04:35.718 --> 04:43.549
Did it take five years for you to... Well, I mean, they keep saying the first novel in six years, but I turned it in a year and a half ago.

04:43.629 --> 04:50.118
I mean, it's true it needed a lot of work, and it took a while to get the book published, but it's not as though I haven't been working away.

04:50.178 --> 04:57.889
It took the better part of four years to work on it, and as I say, those 250 pages really just got sent into the trash.

04:58.009 --> 04:59.651
And in fact, you threw the stuff away.

04:59.711 --> 05:00.332
I threw it away.

05:00.372 --> 05:02.535
You don't save things for your...

05:03.140 --> 05:06.164
No, it's really not saved anywhere in any form.

05:06.184 --> 05:06.765
I don't have it anywhere.

05:06.785 --> 05:07.887
Do you write on a computer?

05:08.047 --> 05:11.031
This is the first book that I've written on a computer, yeah.

05:11.051 --> 05:13.315
I did, with many setbacks, but I did.

05:13.715 --> 05:16.119
So you just kind of erased what was in there.

05:16.139 --> 05:17.280
Yes.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.023
That's quite a moment, isn't it?

05:19.123 --> 05:20.885
Yeah, pretty awful.

05:20.906 --> 05:24.451
I'm redrawn from the galleys, and there's nothing else I could do with the book.

05:24.471 --> 05:31.020
I remember sitting down, it was almost ceremonial with a drink, and deleting the big, huge hundreds and thousands.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.403
huge 20,000-port shafts.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.065
Oh, it's just a terrible feeling.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.668
It's really a terrible feeling, I know.

05:37.068 --> 05:39.271
Well, it's almost exhilarating, though, isn't it?

05:39.632 --> 05:41.134
Well, it does cut you free.

05:41.214 --> 05:44.479
I mean, then you've just got to start over again from scratch.

05:44.559 --> 05:45.360
It's done, yeah.

05:48.004 --> 05:50.528
Do you find that also that your plumbing

05:51.993 --> 06:04.709
I'm picking up on Michiko's review, which she did, and I think I agree with her, that you are really kind of digging deeper emotionally into your characters, and I wonder if you feel the same way.

06:05.671 --> 06:12.479
Well, see, I mean, of course I would have something invested in this opinion, but I don't think it's necessarily that I'm digging deeper.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.283
I think that perhaps I found a way to present things

06:15.635 --> 06:25.327
that even though it's maybe slightly complex, even though she didn't necessarily like the structure that I came up with for this particular book, I think it's more there, though.

06:25.347 --> 06:26.429
I think it's more on the surface.

06:26.449 --> 06:33.458
In other words, I think that Picturing Will and this novel have been more directive in terms of pointing the reader in some direction.

06:33.518 --> 06:42.469
I've sort of admitted to what my sensibility is a little more, whereas when I look back now, I can see that there was extreme restraint in the short stories

06:42.955 --> 06:49.065
They were still an attempt at psychological exploration, and that's no different from what I'm attempting now in my mind.

06:49.125 --> 06:54.974
Now, I see you going back, you're going to do some more stories and perhaps a novella or a show.

06:55.055 --> 06:57.318
I keep, I'm actually working on something longer now.

06:57.338 --> 07:05.011
I'm not quite sure if it'll be a novella or if it'll be a short novel or what it'll be, but I keep thinking I want to get back to stories, but I don't know.

07:05.031 --> 07:06.533
I mean, having spent so many years

07:06.817 --> 07:11.743
with the longer form, it's much harder than I thought to decondition myself, much harder.

07:11.763 --> 07:20.152
Yeah, so it's like Winslow Homer going from, you're married to an artist, going from the wood engravings to the watercolors, and then, of course, the larger work is the royals.

07:20.212 --> 07:29.803
I mean, is the novel for you, I guess I'm trying to ask you to comment on the arc of your career, do you consider the story a

07:30.560 --> 07:35.348
I hesitate to call it a lesser calling, but a less demanding one.

07:35.368 --> 07:36.410
No, no, not at all.

07:36.470 --> 07:43.342
In fact, you know, when I think about my work, I probably could count my favorites on one hand.

07:43.442 --> 07:46.988
I mean, don't ask me off the top of my head, but for instance, the story, The Burning House.

07:49.392 --> 07:54.340
This novel, I personally like this novel better than Picturing Will, even though it was much more of a struggle.

07:54.775 --> 08:02.384
Picturing Will wasn't easy, but I think of them all as stories, and some of them happen to have been about 20 pages, and some of them happen to be 400 pages.

08:02.704 --> 08:04.006
But to me, they're all stories.

08:04.066 --> 08:08.892
How successful were you within your limitations, within your givens of that form?

08:09.032 --> 08:10.854
So you would consider the novel story.

08:11.314 --> 08:11.755
Yeah.

08:11.775 --> 08:17.101
I mean, I would think probably that if I had to pick five favorites, I would end up with four short stories in this novel.

08:17.141 --> 08:17.882
No kidding.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.083
At the moment, anyway.

08:19.504 --> 08:20.705
I might be very misled.

08:21.106 --> 08:21.306
Yeah.

08:21.488 --> 08:26.037
Yeah, no, they're all the same to me, and you use language very differently.

08:26.197 --> 08:40.105
I mean, a painter will tell you, too, that just the physicality of the way the paint is used, as even, say, opposed to acrylics, is entirely different in terms of what you can do and how you need to do it, you know, when you know about those materials in painting.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.670
And I think that the analogy would be that...

08:42.869 --> 08:47.394
language that can serve you well in the shorter form may be your worst enemy in the longer form.

08:47.574 --> 08:49.196
Do you have some kind of an internal clock?

08:49.216 --> 08:56.764
I know, because I write for newspapers and magazines, and they tell you 800 words or 1,000 words or 1,500 words.

08:57.906 --> 08:58.927
There's something there.

08:58.947 --> 09:09.018
I don't know what it is, but you start and you reach your height or whatever it is, and then you start, you really hit that point.

09:09.038 --> 09:11.661
I mean, it's a 1,500-word piece or an 800-word piece.

09:11.810 --> 09:21.324
That was true until very recently, and I think I'm quite thrown off by the computer in that when I used to type with an electric typewriter, I wasn't numbering the pages.

09:21.364 --> 09:26.692
I was doing the rough draft at the electric typewriter, and I typed fast, so I was pulling the sheets if I was on a roll.

09:26.812 --> 09:32.801
But I wouldn't have thought that I understood that I had pulled 25, say, as opposed to 50.

09:33.282 --> 09:37.568
It just seemed to be 25, but when I work on the computer, it just tends to be 50.

09:37.588 --> 09:41.614
The question I'm asking is in a larger sense.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.229
I'm going to write a novel.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.091
I mean, did this start as a novel?

09:45.932 --> 09:50.858
It started with a two-book contract, and the second part of the contract said, you will write a novel.

09:51.239 --> 09:57.446
So when you sat down and the story started to take shape, did you feel that it had the legs to be a novel?

09:59.209 --> 10:08.020
Well, I always fear that it won't, and in fact, the first attempt at this novel, it really didn't have it, nor could it have been a good short story.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.723
It was somewhere in between, you know?

10:10.788 --> 10:13.953
And that's the first time that's really ever happened to me.

10:14.053 --> 10:29.556
But when I started in on the draft that is the basis for the one that you see now, yes, I mean, I knew once I had that many main characters, and once I had realized that I was going to divide the novel into three sections, that it definitely was a novel.

10:29.917 --> 10:36.447
You have no trouble writing about men, or women, or even children in German.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.550
How can you explain that?

10:38.902 --> 10:47.213
Fiction writers I've talked to, I mean, you'll find women who are really just comfortable writing about women and converse with men.

10:47.454 --> 10:52.581
That doesn't seem to intimidate you at all, and you seem to get the voice just right.

10:52.601 --> 10:55.204
Well, I guess it's just lucky maybe that I'm not intimidated.

10:55.665 --> 10:57.968
I don't seem to have been faulted by that.

10:58.349 --> 11:05.078
Well, you know, I'm not writing with any political intent, therefore I think anything's up for grabs, and I know as many old people, young people, women and men,

11:05.227 --> 11:07.169
probably proportionately as anybody else.

11:07.189 --> 11:08.932
It would seem to me that it's all grist for the male.

11:09.592 --> 11:11.795
I hesitate to ask your comment on that.

11:12.356 --> 11:20.126
Thankfully, you haven't heard it in a while, I guess, but when you first arrived, you were proclaimed to be the literary voice of your generation.

11:21.768 --> 11:26.914
It was quite a ... I mean, do you find that when people lay that on you, that there's

11:27.502 --> 11:32.267
Does that lay any kind of pressure on you, any kind of expectation?

11:32.507 --> 11:34.649
It doesn't lay any expectation on me personally.

11:34.669 --> 11:36.771
I mean, I was wildly amused by that.

11:36.851 --> 11:44.179
It seemed incongruous, to put it mildly, even when it was first said, which was probably the late 70s, early 80s.

11:44.559 --> 11:52.167
The only thing that annoys me is that a lot of times I think people read my recent work through a filter of that perception, that, you know, that's a label the media came up with.

11:52.187 --> 11:55.450
I never said, here I am, and I'm the spokesperson for my generation, you know.

11:55.750 --> 12:09.152
So it's annoying many years later when I would say that Another You is radically different from Chilly Scenes of Winter, my first novel, when people are still seeing this book through the filter of Chilly Scenes.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.905
And I don't know what's to be done about that, but frankly, I think it's laziness involved with a lot of these people, you know?

12:15.245 --> 12:17.187
I don't think they should buy their own labels.

12:17.267 --> 12:20.750
I mean, the one thing it seems to me the media should do is question themselves there.

12:21.090 --> 12:23.773
Maybe read them before, but still read all the books.

12:23.793 --> 12:24.093
Yeah.

12:24.353 --> 12:29.998
I did an interview right out here on the Public Garden a couple months ago with Martin Amos, you know.

12:30.298 --> 12:30.659
Uh-huh.

12:30.679 --> 12:38.025
And, of course, he was very quick to offer that, it's not a quotation, but he said,

12:38.765 --> 12:45.674
He considered himself, or he is told that he is the most imitated author of his job.

12:45.694 --> 12:51.843
I mean, he accepts, not only accepts the mantle, he suggests it, you know, that you might even want to consider it.

12:51.863 --> 12:53.665
Oh, heavens.

12:53.725 --> 12:56.869
And I'm not, I'm just making a comparison.

12:57.090 --> 12:57.550
Yeah.

12:57.650 --> 13:00.334
I much prefer your response.

13:00.415 --> 13:09.852
Well, you know, even in the 70s, it seemed to me, I mean, again, what you think you're up to and how people perceive it is, you know, as fair on their part as on your part to have a concept.

13:09.912 --> 13:12.858
But it seemed to me that I was doing improvisations then.

13:12.918 --> 13:20.171
In other words, I didn't think Chili Scenes of Winter was about the so-called zeitgeist, which is a word still applied to me mysteriously.

13:20.211 --> 13:21.073
I don't understand it.

13:21.290 --> 13:34.143
I mean, I thought that these were a bunch of very fringe characters, and I hope that what I was doing in that book, and what I still hope that I'm doing, is saying something about the human condition, regardless of the contemporary setting that it may be in.

13:34.163 --> 13:36.646
Do you find that you're growing with your characters?

13:36.666 --> 13:41.331
Do you find that they're kind of coming along with you?

13:41.351 --> 13:44.955
Well, I would find it very hard at this point to write about 20-year-olds.

13:45.035 --> 13:46.156
I'm not saying I couldn't do it.

13:46.176 --> 13:47.297
I mean, I think Richard Price...

13:47.530 --> 13:53.637
does not necessarily live the life of clockers, and the guy goes out and does great research, and apparently he's got it down.

13:53.738 --> 13:55.119
Everybody seems to like that book.

13:55.139 --> 13:55.580
Did you read it?

13:55.720 --> 13:56.281
I didn't, actually.

13:56.321 --> 13:57.021
My husband read it.

13:57.162 --> 13:57.622
Did you like it?

13:57.802 --> 13:58.463
Yeah, he loved it.

13:58.583 --> 14:02.148
I mean, I do like Price's work, you know, but it would not occur.

14:02.168 --> 14:14.763
I mean, I'm sure it's possible to get better at something, but I'm afraid that I take what is more at hand, not because it's the easiest thing to do, but because I don't have to educate myself about that.

14:14.783 --> 14:15.664
I mean,

14:16.150 --> 14:19.636
You have a terrific, very substantial body of work.

14:20.457 --> 14:22.741
Do you see your work as a corpus?

14:22.761 --> 14:26.227
Do you think, you know, 15 years from now that it will be judged?

14:27.630 --> 14:32.278
Would you like to see it?

14:32.298 --> 14:37.166
I guess if I, I mean, I'll never, you know, I'll never get my druthers, so I don't spend much time thinking about it.

14:37.186 --> 14:41.854
I mean, I really do understand that's nothing that I can influence in any way.

14:41.986 --> 15:03.520
I guess, though, that, you know, I've always protested that I'm not writing sociology, and if it could be lifted out of that rather limited viewpoint that some people, not everybody certainly, I don't think John Updike thinks I'm writing sociology, you know, but if it could be, if it could not be considered so much in context and the larger implications could be considered, I would be more pleased.

15:05.122 --> 15:07.145
Do you like the arc of your career?

15:07.326 --> 15:08.247
Do you like the way it's

15:09.037 --> 15:10.879
I'm surprised I don't write more stories.

15:11.019 --> 15:24.012
I would have thought I would have stuck with that more, and as I say, although novels continue to be even more problematic in terms of writing them, I wouldn't have anticipated that I would be this genuinely interested by them.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.015
Challenged or interested?

15:26.035 --> 15:26.555
Challenged.

15:27.336 --> 15:28.037
Are you challenged?

15:29.018 --> 15:29.458
Yeah.

15:29.478 --> 15:33.222
Because, I mean, the last quote that I saw, you said, I'm not going to touch it.

15:33.404 --> 15:35.888
These things are heartfelt when I say them.

15:36.028 --> 15:37.690
Truly, they are heartfelt when I say them.

15:37.710 --> 15:38.892
I think you're feeling differently now.

15:38.912 --> 15:39.934
That must have been right after.

15:40.815 --> 15:44.060
And you also recorded saying you're never going to write another novel with a contract.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.001
Is that true?

15:45.321 --> 15:47.384
I don't have a contract now, and who knows what I'm working on?

15:47.405 --> 15:50.108
I mean, it might very well be a novel, so I don't know.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.373
Was there any kind of experience that you had that you cared about?

15:53.393 --> 16:00.664
Well, the only thing I would say is that, you know, having taken two book contracts in a row, number one, I mean, I don't mean to sound snotty here.

16:00.684 --> 16:02.386
I'm extremely lucky to have been given them.

16:02.487 --> 16:02.787
I mean,

16:03.104 --> 16:05.606
The publishers did take these novels sight unseen.

16:05.787 --> 16:08.830
It was a hypothetical novel buy, which is awfully nice.

16:08.910 --> 16:10.291
I realize my position.

16:10.331 --> 16:11.172
That's very nice.

16:12.713 --> 16:19.640
But it might have been true 10 years ago that I couldn't have written a novel without, in effect, a deadline hanging over my head.

16:20.101 --> 16:22.783
Let's see what I can do at this age versus 10 years ago.

16:23.084 --> 16:24.105
My life is quite different.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.126
I don't teach anymore.

16:25.166 --> 16:29.190
There are a lot of things that are very different about my life.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.773
Maybe I don't need that artificial demand anymore hanging over my head.

16:32.905 --> 16:41.056
I also understand that you used to write things like... Didn't I?

16:41.096 --> 16:41.877
Boy, I was lucky.

16:42.839 --> 16:43.319
Yeah.

16:43.339 --> 16:48.006
Is that it gets harder, or are you going to feel... It's harder.

16:48.026 --> 16:48.707
It is harder.

16:48.807 --> 16:49.287
Much harder.

16:49.307 --> 16:51.630
But is the work better, in your view?

16:51.651 --> 16:52.712
Well, not inevitably.

16:52.752 --> 17:00.202
You know, I mean, I would say that, you know, The Burning House, which I wrote when I think I was 32 or 33 years old, is still one of my favorite stories.

17:01.023 --> 17:01.844
I don't know.

17:01.904 --> 17:02.305
I think it's

17:02.420 --> 17:07.527
mix and match of every period, you know, and it even takes me a while sometimes to sort things out.

17:07.547 --> 17:10.150
I mean, I'm genuinely enthusiastic about another you now.

17:10.731 --> 17:14.176
I was enthusiastic but also circumspect about picturing Will.

17:14.196 --> 17:17.340
I mean, I didn't quite understand why that was so strongly reacted to.

17:18.021 --> 17:24.630
You mentioned picturing Will and the fact that at this point in your life it's hard to write about 20-year-old people, but in that

17:24.948 --> 17:25.849
A kid.

17:25.869 --> 17:26.750
A kid.

17:26.911 --> 17:27.712
Explain that for me.

17:28.032 --> 17:33.319
Well, my interest in writing that book, of course, was in how the kid influenced the adult characters.

17:33.660 --> 17:37.284
You know, how he was a constant presence, even though, in effect, he's on camera very little.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.706
There are very few things.

17:38.726 --> 17:39.728
It's not a book about a kid.

17:39.748 --> 17:47.878
It's sort of like, it seems to me more about what a kid does to totally affect the lives of those people who are responsible for him.

17:48.359 --> 17:53.706
But, also, I could say I was an only child, you know, and I think you do become introspective as a child.

17:53.888 --> 17:59.735
I think I thought about childhood and the oddity of childhood as a child, and that stayed fresh in my mind.

17:59.915 --> 18:02.338
Yeah, but the voice, the characterization was perfect.

18:02.358 --> 18:08.985
I mean, my great criticism was Shakespeare, but I love living with Shakespeare, but he could never do kids.

18:09.025 --> 18:11.788
You know, all of those kids are brilliant little people.

18:13.270 --> 18:15.913
But he really did manage to do that.

18:16.147 --> 18:19.150
In this book, too, you are going back, aren't you?

18:20.231 --> 18:21.592
There is an exploration.

18:21.632 --> 18:24.394
I think also anything that isn't right under your nose can seem mysterious.

18:24.414 --> 18:25.856
I mean, I don't personally have children.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.178
I obviously know a lot of people who have children.

18:28.698 --> 18:34.463
I think when I'm with those children, I tend to think about them in a different way than their parents do because I can afford to.

18:34.483 --> 18:38.627
It's, you know, thanks for the day's information and so good night, you know, and I drive away.

18:38.647 --> 18:44.112
I don't know that this would be such an interesting topic to me if I lived with a kid 24 hours in bed.

18:44.530 --> 18:46.112
Now, you live up in Maine.

18:46.272 --> 18:47.434
I'm just curious.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.475
I went to school in Maine.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.378
I went to Fades up in Maine.

18:50.398 --> 18:51.159
I'm just curious.

18:51.179 --> 18:52.301
This is not for my piece.

18:52.321 --> 18:52.621
York.

18:53.442 --> 18:55.325
We were up in York yesterday, for God's sake.

18:55.405 --> 18:57.968
I just can't tell you how much I honestly wish you would come out of the house.

18:57.988 --> 18:58.990
I was doing nothing.

18:59.751 --> 19:00.191
Nothing.

19:01.113 --> 19:01.433
Yeah.

19:01.814 --> 19:06.660
I was signing some books in Exeter, New Hampshire, for these people who sell books.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.301
That's just ridiculous.

19:07.321 --> 19:07.782
I'm so sorry.

19:07.822 --> 19:10.065
So we said, let's take a little ride up to Maine.

19:10.085 --> 19:11.647
We'll have a lobster or something.

19:12.068 --> 19:12.869
Isn't that funny?

19:12.889 --> 19:13.069
Yeah.

19:13.471 --> 19:15.514
But I'm glad we're reading today's book.

19:15.534 --> 19:15.754
Yeah.

19:16.936 --> 19:19.239
I think we've written about one, so I don't want to think.

19:21.542 --> 19:25.528
I'm not really cross-tanker about the book, because that's my job, and I really enjoy it.

19:26.710 --> 19:30.695
Has time taught you anything as a writer?

19:30.715 --> 19:36.844
Just considering you started, at such a young age, started publishing?

19:36.864 --> 19:38.486
Oh, lots of things, I think.

19:38.546 --> 19:41.250
I mean, really, one of the things is certainly humility.

19:41.382 --> 19:47.533
If I ever might have assumed that I was going to dash something off and it was going to work, I can tell you those days have disappeared.

19:47.633 --> 19:50.999
You know, hard work has replaced the dashing off.

19:51.219 --> 19:53.283
Isn't it amazing, the arrogance of you, huh?

19:53.303 --> 19:56.168
Yeah, you know, I didn't... I didn't expect the New Yorkers going to love it.

19:56.328 --> 19:56.648
Yeah.

19:56.668 --> 20:01.537
But then when I read that you did all these things in a year, well, I mean, you're still doing pretty good.

20:01.817 --> 20:06.225
Yeah, no, I think, you know, at the end of any year, my output looks pretty good, but...

20:06.712 --> 20:10.336
I just don't have the momentary flashes.

20:10.657 --> 20:18.546
I sometimes do, but those days are banging out a rough draft of what I consider to be a really good short story or just not there anymore for whatever reason.

20:19.027 --> 20:33.664
The other thing, too, is that I think I do realize both sides of the coin in terms of how very lucky I am in a lot of ways, as I was just explaining about having these novels taken sight unseen and so forth.

20:33.948 --> 20:51.796
I mean, I don't think I had a cavalier attitude before, but when I see increasingly how very difficult it is for first-rate writers to prevail, you know, I mean, I know people who have written excellent books, who have sent them into the publisher, and they've been rejected merely because the books are too depressing.

20:52.237 --> 20:59.628
I mean, frankly, I don't think that would happen to me, and I'm lucky that I've got such a track record that it wouldn't happen to me, but it shouldn't happen to anybody, you know.

20:59.668 --> 21:02.132
Look at Bill Kennedy's Iron Week is the perfect example.

21:02.652 --> 21:05.256
It went around and around and around, yes.

21:05.576 --> 21:08.140
They said, who's interested in a bunch of bums in Albany, New York?

21:08.180 --> 21:09.903
Yeah, yeah.

21:09.923 --> 21:13.248
Late novels of the last quarter century, I think.

21:13.268 --> 21:14.249
Yeah, I know.

21:15.411 --> 21:17.014
You know, those things are very unnerving.

21:17.294 --> 21:19.738
I think those things register with me more now.

21:19.998 --> 21:22.241
In other words, you know, I said this to my husband, too.

21:22.281 --> 21:26.668
He's a figurative painter, and it's not particularly the age of figuration by any means.

21:27.222 --> 21:35.195
You know, it's not a supportive thing to realize that you might be doing well, but so many other people who should be doing well are not.

21:35.615 --> 21:38.320
And when I was younger, I really was an exception.

21:38.340 --> 21:43.167
I mean, to have that many stories in The New Yorker compared to other people my age was very unusual.

21:43.248 --> 21:44.830
Now, actually, it's not so unusual.

21:44.910 --> 21:48.716
You see a lot of people those ages who are just kids.

21:48.997 --> 21:49.618
But it's great.

21:49.638 --> 21:52.943
I mean, it's a new day in a lot of ways.

21:53.243 --> 21:54.865
welcome them.

21:54.885 --> 21:55.406
Absolutely.

21:55.446 --> 22:01.674
No, I mean, I can name, you know, very, very good young writers that I'm absolutely delighted to see in their pages and in other pages, definitely.

22:01.774 --> 22:06.080
But I think I realized in retrospect that I was something of an exception.

22:07.742 --> 22:10.807
Did your husband title this book?

22:11.087 --> 22:11.467
No.

22:12.128 --> 22:14.391
He definitely titled Picturing Will, yes.

22:14.411 --> 22:14.972
No, he didn't.

22:14.992 --> 22:16.074
I titled this book.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.477
Yeah, it's maybe the only novel I've ever titled.

22:18.657 --> 22:18.998
Really?

22:19.018 --> 22:19.318
Yeah.

22:19.687 --> 22:23.413
And did you have that title early into the... No, no, I didn't.

22:23.673 --> 22:25.416
And in fact... It certainly works.

22:25.656 --> 22:26.838
Yeah, it does.

22:26.858 --> 22:28.581
I debated a lot.

22:28.621 --> 22:35.772
I can't remember, but there were like three or four real possibilities about the book, and I suddenly did realize it should be this title.

22:36.834 --> 22:45.427
I read that, I think you told me, you really never start with an outline or a clear sense of where this is going to go.

22:45.648 --> 22:45.788
No.

22:46.068 --> 22:47.871
Is that still the case?

22:48.239 --> 22:50.002
Yeah, it still is the case.

22:50.884 --> 22:59.379
I certainly did realize that I was working within certain conventions, but what I tried to do was to stand those conventions on their head in this book.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.383
I mean, it's not an academic novel.

23:01.663 --> 23:03.306
It's not an on-the-road novel.

23:03.907 --> 23:11.040
Of course, I invoke all those things, but for a purpose, for the purpose of sabotage.

23:12.117 --> 23:14.801
I was worried, and in fact, I have some reason to worry.

23:14.841 --> 23:20.869
I mean, to some extent, some reviews have perceived this as, oh, God, I mean, Time magazine gives it a very negative review this week.

23:20.889 --> 23:23.273
It says, oh, God, no, it's, you know, it's another academic novel.

23:23.774 --> 23:24.455
Absolutely not.

23:24.655 --> 23:26.437
They didn't get beyond the first year.

23:26.457 --> 23:27.239
I know they didn't.

23:27.279 --> 23:29.121
I actually think that that's the case, you know.

23:29.682 --> 23:37.433
But in other words, I realized to some extent that I was flirting with danger and that it could misfire.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.832
a lot of territory pretty quickly.

23:45.992 --> 23:51.238
I taught out at Northwestern last fall, and I actually had my husband come in and talk about art.

23:51.278 --> 23:58.585
I was trying to have him explain how certain problems in art are solved within the canvas, and I had been trying to explain how certain things were solved on the page.

23:59.146 --> 24:04.371
When he left the classroom, one of my students said to me, you and Mr. Perry really talk fast.

24:06.774 --> 24:08.736
When I come to transcribe, it's wonderful.

24:08.876 --> 24:09.917
I'd much rather have a

24:10.167 --> 24:12.750
a forty minute tape and an hour and a half tape outside of it.

24:12.810 --> 24:13.791
Yeah.

24:15.193 --> 24:16.915
Yeah, sometimes you have questions.

24:18.237 --> 24:19.879
Do you write vainly?

24:20.039 --> 24:23.783
You really do give us some nice pictures.

24:23.803 --> 24:25.065
Yeah, absolutely.

24:25.225 --> 24:39.162
I said this recently, not in print, I think probably to my students last fall or something, but I've come to realize, too, that if I can see something, it doesn't have to be conspicuous, it can be very ordinary,

24:39.361 --> 24:47.869
If I really can close my eyes as I'm typing and see it, I have no trouble knowing how people talk in that context.

24:48.349 --> 24:54.014
But if I had to set people talking and I wasn't clear what room or what environment they were in, it would just fade out.

24:54.054 --> 24:55.315
It would absolutely fade out.

24:56.196 --> 24:57.998
It's interesting that I'm married to a painter.

24:58.038 --> 25:05.024
For whatever reason, what precedes everything is a very clear visual image that I then animate.

25:05.424 --> 25:08.727
It never, ever has gone the other way.

25:09.483 --> 25:10.965
There was a non-fiction book that you did.

25:10.985 --> 25:12.006
I think it was with Abel.

25:12.307 --> 25:13.228
Yeah, Alex Katz.

25:13.248 --> 25:14.069
That was kind of nice.

25:14.550 --> 25:15.611
I think we talked about that.

25:16.853 --> 25:19.316
That was one of the interviews we did.

25:22.220 --> 25:28.108
Are you out constantly paying attention to see little things, like a beagle on the road or something?

25:28.749 --> 25:29.570
Well, yes and no.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.172
I mean, yes to the extent that yes.

25:32.013 --> 25:34.356
But those things tend not to turn up in my fiction.

25:35.157 --> 25:36.099
Well, how does that happen?

25:36.119 --> 25:37.060
I mean, it's...

25:37.478 --> 25:39.801
Well, everything doesn't seem grist for the mill, you know?

25:39.821 --> 25:47.192
I mean, it's what you can latch on to that seems able to be transformed, I think, also.

25:47.212 --> 25:52.380
In other words, I don't think that what I'm looking at is, you know, it's not a photograph.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.522
I mean, it's more a painting.

25:53.602 --> 25:57.748
It's more something that my sensibility has gotten into to render to begin with.

25:57.908 --> 25:59.631
Would you say it's an impressionist painting?

25:59.851 --> 26:01.313
No, I don't actually think so.

26:01.373 --> 26:04.077
I mean, no.

26:04.242 --> 26:08.567
But probably, you know, analogous to a realistic Estes or something.

26:08.587 --> 26:14.713
I mean, that's actually photorealism, but probably, oh, it's Winslow Homer, you know.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.335
Something fairly realistic.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.778
But already my sensibility is there.

26:18.818 --> 26:19.739
I mean, I'm interpreting.

26:19.779 --> 26:24.644
I'm not trying to do what Estes is doing and be, you know, more keen than the camera eye, in effect.

26:26.086 --> 26:30.030
So I think there's some sort of a bond that goes on between me and the environment.

26:30.247 --> 26:43.811
But, you know, I've failed too many times too early on to think that I can still take, you know, amusing street scenes or even amusing overheard conversation and have it work in the same way once I put it in a literary context.

26:44.432 --> 26:49.200
So, again, what I'm doing is improvisations and something filtered through my sensibility to begin with.

26:49.467 --> 26:52.952
improvisations, but you certainly work a kind of a mystery into here.

26:53.453 --> 26:54.314
In this book.

26:54.575 --> 26:55.176
Yeah.

26:55.436 --> 26:57.279
It is almost a mystery story.

26:57.299 --> 26:59.162
That suggests plotting, doesn't it?

27:00.203 --> 27:01.085
Yeah.

27:01.445 --> 27:10.058
I must say that I knew at some point in the writing of this draft what was going to go on, but it wasn't until McCallum and Marshall

27:10.392 --> 27:14.257
were going to see Cheryl Lanier's mother that I thought of that twist.

27:14.437 --> 27:16.419
That was absolutely unpremeditated.

27:16.439 --> 27:24.930
And I personally think that that's quite lively when he tells him at the table in the subsequent phone conversation that Marshall has because I was so surprised I could be Marshall.

27:25.290 --> 27:39.488
I mean, realizing that the mother didn't know that this was going on, it was very, very easy to put myself into the mind of a totally... I mean, in a way, the woman's quite inured, but she's also completely shocked.

27:40.244 --> 27:41.866
You know, so that was easy.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.269
I mean, whenever I get shocked, the characters can be shocked.

27:45.371 --> 27:47.633
Hello?

27:47.653 --> 27:49.756
I get plenty of stuff that you haven't had in the next one.

27:49.776 --> 27:50.417
Oh, fine.

27:50.437 --> 27:52.119
Did you do one of them up soon?

27:52.740 --> 27:54.542
Could you give it just five minutes?

27:54.562 --> 27:55.964
Okay, thank you very much.

27:55.984 --> 27:58.527
6.20 is out.

27:58.547 --> 27:58.688
Uh-huh.

27:58.708 --> 27:59.949
Okay, thanks.

27:59.969 --> 28:00.049
Bye.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.332
It's just a tanner of me, but that's all.

28:02.352 --> 28:02.873
Yeah, I know.

28:03.173 --> 28:04.815
We'll give you a few minutes for the next one.

28:04.835 --> 28:06.357
Would you inscribe this for me, please?

28:06.477 --> 28:07.038
Probably, Jake.

28:07.138 --> 28:07.759
Yeah, sure.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.082
My great collection of inscribed books.

28:10.872 --> 28:12.054
Can I take your pen, too?

28:12.094 --> 28:20.208
Oh, isn't that pretty?

28:20.308 --> 28:27.700
Oh, that's lovely.

28:28.355 --> 28:30.097
What's his name?

28:30.197 --> 28:31.258
His name is R.C.

28:31.338 --> 28:33.461
Binstock, Bob Binstock.

28:33.761 --> 28:34.902
How do you spell his name?

28:34.982 --> 28:36.724
It fits in the Times, I'll find it.

28:36.864 --> 28:42.110
Yeah, B-I-N-S-T-O-C-K, and his book is published by Soho, and it's called Tree of Heaven.

28:42.130 --> 28:43.251
Oh, I saw that.

28:43.271 --> 28:44.333
It got a rave review.

28:44.353 --> 28:45.574
It really should have.

28:46.054 --> 28:46.975
I admit my bias.

28:46.996 --> 28:49.058
He was my student at Harvard in 1977.

28:49.358 --> 28:52.982
One quick question that I would have asked you.

28:53.002 --> 28:55.645
Do you know more about your characters than you put in your books?

28:55.827 --> 28:57.389
I mean, you said you threw away 250 pages?

28:57.670 --> 28:59.732
No, no, it wasn't thrown out on that basis.

28:59.792 --> 29:01.114
It was just that I hit the wrong room.

29:01.134 --> 29:01.715
But normally do you know?

29:01.735 --> 29:04.980
I mean, are there parts of the history that aren't in the books that you know?

29:05.000 --> 29:12.310
I mean, if I were to ask you, you know, how old he was when he lost his virginity or something like that, you know?

29:12.330 --> 29:13.091
No, no.

29:13.371 --> 29:23.505
I mean, I could make some educated guesses, but it's not as though I think that there's a whole world of information I'm selecting from it, so that therefore I could then answer about this whole world of information.

29:23.485 --> 29:26.448
I've really only thought to my way of thinking about the essential thing.

29:26.508 --> 29:26.889
Really?

29:27.049 --> 29:31.354
And then if you were to say, well, I'm dressed this way, if I were wearing a hat, what do you think I'd have on?

29:31.374 --> 29:33.136
Well, it's clearly not a sombrero, right?

29:33.156 --> 29:33.897
You know what I mean?

29:33.917 --> 29:44.289
So, I mean, you could make an educated guess considering what you've created, but no, and I never think about that, because I have to at least have the illusion that I've already found the essential stuff, you know?

29:44.429 --> 29:52.598
I mean, I'm sure I miss fire sometimes, but it's thinking, oh, yes, I see it is chiseled down a form what this can be, and that, for me, is the only reality.

29:53.017 --> 29:54.985
I just did an interview with Kay Gibbons.

29:55.005 --> 29:56.269
Oh, I like her a lot.

29:56.290 --> 29:57.213
And she's just the opposite.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.000
This book was twice as long.

29:59.100 --> 30:03.718
She said, but I had to know about this life, what she became before I could really...

30:04.002 --> 30:05.484
Yeah, I think I've heard her.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.828
She said something similar about Ellen Foster one time.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.531
She and I were speaking together at some book and author lunch.

30:10.592 --> 30:13.115
I think that was the context here.

30:13.135 --> 30:14.858
No, actually, it was the new book, Hattie.

30:14.898 --> 30:26.094
The other thing, though, which is interesting, is that I have to actually physically put, I often omit things after I've written them, but I have to physically put it in the page because it wouldn't do for me to just know somebody had graduated from Princeton.

30:26.114 --> 30:28.137
I have to say that at some point, and then later I think,

30:28.353 --> 30:30.099
do I need, you know, and then structure.

30:30.119 --> 30:30.881
But now you know, though.

30:30.901 --> 30:31.564
But now you know.

30:31.664 --> 30:32.246
But now I know.

30:32.607 --> 30:35.577
But that's Flannery O'Connor who says you have to put it there before you can take it away.

30:35.958 --> 30:36.841
I take her literally.

30:36.921 --> 30:38.467
You have to physically put it there.

30:38.868 --> 30:39.590
That's a good point.

30:39.751 --> 30:40.754
That's a good one.

30:40.935 --> 30:41.637
See you again.
