WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:04.639
Perfectly with Nicholas Barker.

00:04.659 --> 00:13.828
And I apparently miss... I said Harry Ransom's fondness for LDS.

00:13.968 --> 00:14.909
And you said not fondness.

00:15.509 --> 00:15.810
Yes.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.433
He had a very great respect for him as a finder of books.

00:20.734 --> 00:25.659
A very considerable understanding of him as a human being.

00:25.779 --> 00:28.722
And a very shrewd assessment of what he had to offer Texas.

00:31.344 --> 00:33.126
But fondness, no.

00:33.646 --> 00:39.256
You should talk to the present director.

00:39.736 --> 00:40.478
I have.

00:40.498 --> 00:41.319
Tom Staley?

00:41.459 --> 00:42.121
Tom Staley.

00:42.221 --> 00:42.481
I've been.

00:42.541 --> 00:43.803
I said four days ago.

00:43.823 --> 00:47.911
And he gave a speech at the RBMS.

00:48.011 --> 00:49.473
I have a copy of this.

00:49.734 --> 00:53.460
I've already got a copy of it.

00:54.284 --> 00:59.750
the tenor of the correspondence between Ransom and ODS.

00:59.770 --> 01:01.352
But it wasn't exactly fondness.

01:01.512 --> 01:15.527
It was a very well-knowledged, an acknowledgement on both sides of a very significant common interest.

01:15.547 --> 01:23.616
Off the record, I asked to see, I asked Hanselian if I could see the files, the Feldman files, and he...

01:23.933 --> 01:26.458
grant me that access.

01:28.101 --> 01:30.586
Does that surprise you?

01:30.686 --> 01:31.768
Not very much, no.

01:31.848 --> 01:36.938
I mean, I'm not sure that I would give anybody access to the files.

01:37.198 --> 01:44.312
I don't think I could give anybody access to the files of our recent correspondence.

01:44.352 --> 01:45.755
He said basically the same thing.

01:45.895 --> 01:46.937
He said, don't confuse

01:47.626 --> 02:17.245
correspondence with with the materials that are here at the hrc he said they're two entirely different things and he said i really don't think that i can do that that seems to be quite proper and uh i'm not reading anything into it but uh there was a unique relationship between texas yeah and i'm trying to establish that in print and apparently it hasn't been done there has been a scurrilous are you familiar with the charles hamilton attack uh the book

02:17.798 --> 02:20.501
Hamilton's an unusual fellow, I'm so sure you know.

02:21.082 --> 02:23.886
I've interviewed him, by the way.

02:23.986 --> 02:35.060
In 1981, he alleged, in a book he wrote titled Auction Madness, and he said point blank in there that Feldman and Ransom built the University of Texas at millions of dollars.

02:35.160 --> 02:43.350
And he said the way they did it, it was really, if either of these men were alive, they would have an ironclad

02:43.887 --> 02:46.209
libel suits against Hamilton.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.931
But, of course, they were both dead.

02:47.971 --> 02:50.854
You can't bring dead people, can't sue for libel.

02:51.214 --> 02:58.902
Well, to make a long story short, I called Hamilton, I interviewed him, and I said, you made a very serious charge here.

02:59.062 --> 03:02.265
I wonder if you can document this for me.

03:02.766 --> 03:03.747
What do you base this on?

03:03.767 --> 03:04.568
Can you give me a case?

03:05.468 --> 03:10.013
What he said is that Feldman would bid the price up enormously.

03:10.769 --> 03:16.936
He'd buy something for a cheap price and sell it to Texas for an enormous price, and that these two guys split the money.

03:16.977 --> 03:18.839
This is what he said in this article.

03:18.939 --> 03:20.701
I said, do you have any evidence for this?

03:20.741 --> 03:21.842
I mean, this is quite a charge.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.526
The short of it is he has no evidence for it.

03:24.566 --> 03:32.255
He said his source for that was a woman who used to work for Feldman who he would not identify.

03:33.637 --> 03:36.440
But she told him this, and I said, well, did she have an axe to grind?

03:36.460 --> 03:38.042
She said, I don't have to record all this.

03:38.832 --> 03:40.214
study is about motivation.

03:40.414 --> 03:56.677
Well, I mean, Ransom would buy books from anywhere, and he had other people besides Feldman who wrote it here.

03:57.338 --> 03:57.839
Very much so.

03:57.859 --> 04:07.152
The late Mr. Ritter was saying books to Texas in quantity long before LDF came on the scene.

04:07.756 --> 04:12.761
There were many other booksellers who worked with Ransom.

04:13.822 --> 04:15.384
So, did you know Ransom at all?

04:16.264 --> 04:20.589
I've been in the same room with him a couple of times.

04:20.609 --> 04:24.553
Do you think he was knowledgeable?

04:25.674 --> 04:26.995
Was he a knowledgeable book man?

04:27.115 --> 04:29.237
Do you think he knew what he was buying?

04:29.818 --> 04:35.063
Or was he really on a mission to buy as much as he could, as quickly as he could?

04:36.325 --> 04:38.367
That's a rather delicate way.

04:39.027 --> 04:43.651
No, I mean, obviously he was an administrator, first and foremost.

04:43.671 --> 04:54.921
He couldn't have done what he did if he hadn't devoted most of his waking hours to making this extraordinary institution grow to what it became.

04:54.961 --> 05:02.748
That he knew very well exactly what he was buying is beyond doubt.

05:03.889 --> 05:05.590
If you were to ask him,

05:06.262 --> 05:14.049
if he had recently bought this, that, or the other small book, I mean, I wouldn't have been able to take it.

05:14.069 --> 05:22.917
It also seems, it also has been alleged on the BBC and any number of other places that he bought a lot of worthless stuff.

05:22.937 --> 05:33.467
Well, worthless, of course, is a value judgment, and it's not the kind of verdict that most librarians would like to make, because

05:34.055 --> 05:39.442
what is worth this today may be invaluable tomorrow, and vice versa.

05:39.462 --> 05:50.798
And if you make the decision, also, to collect the manuscripts, the archival material of living people, well, obviously you're going to make a mistake.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.119
You are, yes, absolutely.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.643
Absolutely.

05:55.284 --> 05:59.930
I mean, time hasn't had a chance to work its magic.

06:00.210 --> 06:00.771
No, exactly.

06:01.038 --> 06:08.930
And I mean, but remember that the HRC bought a great deal more besides modern manuscripts.

06:08.950 --> 06:16.822
They happened to sort of collect them in overpowering strength, but all at the same time, they were buying old material as well.

06:17.864 --> 06:28.400
I also, I have to say, when I was there, I've been now to operate most of the great libraries, and I was really impressed by what I saw.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.982
I think it's an extraordinary

06:30.316 --> 06:31.598
collection.

06:32.639 --> 06:44.855
And while there may be some low spots, there are a lot of high spots, and Madame de Lucie, you know, I wanted to get the French evaluation of the French collection there.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.419
And she said it's the best collection she knows outside of France.

06:47.659 --> 06:52.185
She said it categorically.

06:52.525 --> 06:56.070
She compared it to a Baltimore collection and said it was superior, as a matter of fact.

06:57.451 --> 07:05.203
Well, I think that's right, because the Bodmer collection is now, has quite a lot of books been removed from the Bodmer collection.

07:07.487 --> 07:21.889
I think that to compare the three institutions would only be possible for a certain class of French material, mainly the literary manuscripts of the last hundred years, because Texas is holding the literary manuscripts

07:24.181 --> 07:36.196
We are focusing, we are confining our comments obviously to the last, I don't even know if it's the last hundred years so much, but it's the 20th century.

07:38.919 --> 07:40.441
But anyway, that's not the point.

07:40.781 --> 07:46.088
You told me when we spoke in November that those who criticize Texas

07:46.456 --> 07:53.763
And I've heard this from Roger Stoddard, and I've heard this from Bob Nightkirk and Tom Tanzel of the book.

07:54.443 --> 07:57.306
You've all basically used the same words, sour grapes.

07:58.046 --> 08:00.228
Yes, yes.

08:00.669 --> 08:07.215
I mean, most people would love to be given a blank check to find anything with.

08:07.235 --> 08:16.463
So you think you would say, not think, but you would say that what they did down there was not necessarily any responsible

08:18.097 --> 08:22.200
or was it an expression of institutional bibliolania, shall we say?

08:24.282 --> 08:26.104
That's just a question.

08:26.164 --> 08:35.652
It's not a phrase I'm asking any user or proof or anything.

08:35.672 --> 08:36.453
Just a comment on it.

08:36.473 --> 08:37.053
Yes, well.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.462
I mean, everybody has their own taste.

08:48.016 --> 09:00.091
We are nothing but the expression of the collective taste of the country that we live in and the people who we are to do the jobs that we want done.

09:00.431 --> 09:05.337
The selection that we make won't satisfy everybody.

09:05.357 --> 09:08.461
It may satisfy nobody.

09:08.861 --> 09:12.606
All we hope is that it doesn't greatly offend

09:17.952 --> 09:20.935
Very important point.

09:22.157 --> 09:23.378
I think that's enough on Texas.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.320
I did talk to Warren Roberts, by the way.

09:25.340 --> 09:26.862
Oh, yeah.

09:28.023 --> 09:33.609
The one mystery man I can't seem to locate is Deckard Turfman.

09:33.689 --> 09:34.851
He's disappeared off the map.

09:34.951 --> 09:35.572
He really has.

09:35.592 --> 09:39.216
Nobody at the university even knows where he's gone.

09:39.656 --> 09:40.497
Has his phone number.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.200
He's in Austin.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.135
He shows up at wrestling matches, they say.

09:47.016 --> 09:48.177
I have his address.

09:49.738 --> 09:55.744
I was even tempted to drive over there and knock on the door, but that's not the way I like to play.

09:55.764 --> 09:56.585
No.

09:56.605 --> 09:59.088
That's ambush journalism, and I'm not into that.

09:59.128 --> 10:03.832
Couldn't you... Oh, I can write him.

10:03.872 --> 10:09.178
And I really want him to comment, because he did do some very good things.

10:09.198 --> 10:11.500
I mean, the Ford Skyler collection alone is...

10:11.935 --> 10:13.858
in a significant position.

10:14.098 --> 10:38.095
Yes, though in a sense, I mean, I think he would say that his main contribution was to remove massive acquisitions from being the sole residential institution into a position where it was

10:38.632 --> 10:42.478
regarded as another factor alongside conservation of what they had.

10:43.299 --> 10:46.624
He coined the phrase, have you ever seen his HRC notes?

10:46.644 --> 10:50.890
He put out these little telegrams, and he sent them to people.

10:51.010 --> 10:53.273
I would say in a set of them.

10:53.293 --> 11:02.607
And in one, he coined the phrase, he coined the phrase, let's not continue with the ransom syndrome, which is what you just described.

11:02.947 --> 11:03.148
Yes.

11:03.188 --> 11:07.474
Which is buying, not on block, not just on block, on block, but

11:08.146 --> 11:08.627
Everything.

11:09.608 --> 11:11.311
Casting a wide net, shall we say.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.032
Let's focus.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.617
Let's use a laser beam to make it a little more precise.

11:16.818 --> 11:23.488
And I think that embarrasses them a little bit, the fact that he has outspoken about one of his predecessors.

11:23.828 --> 11:28.335
By the way, Carlton Lake served very briefly as interim director.

11:28.355 --> 11:28.715
Yes, I know.

11:28.736 --> 11:35.385
That was when he took such a very great dislike to this country.

11:35.753 --> 11:37.996
Now, can you give me a little background on this?

11:38.016 --> 11:43.143
Well, it was... If you don't mind, I'll confront him on it, by the way.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.985
That's all in the public record.

11:45.666 --> 11:51.994
He... And Decker Turner was also involved.

11:52.575 --> 12:05.372
They had intended to try and... The fund was launched to try and rescue the house, Charleston House in Sussex, where Clive Bell and a number of other people from Bloomsbury

12:05.605 --> 12:16.256
Duke group had lived and worked in the 30s and had been sort of decorated with wall paintings by Vanessa Bell and people like that.

12:17.557 --> 12:23.003
And Texas were going to bid on these things.

12:23.843 --> 12:32.372
And then they say they were alerted to the fact that all the documents had been microfilmed by the owners before consigning them for sale.

12:33.112 --> 12:43.525
And so they did a sudden volt fast and decided not to bid on anything in the sale on the grounds that it was, as it were, contaminated by the fact that copies of it existed.

12:44.766 --> 12:58.343
And they then launched a violent attack on the British for being dishonest in not...

13:00.955 --> 13:02.878
Not disclosing this information?

13:02.918 --> 13:08.728
No, for not disclosing the information before the sale.

13:10.050 --> 13:15.118
But I really don't see... That's a non-issue.

13:15.138 --> 13:16.400
They just don't bid on the stuff.

13:16.881 --> 13:17.843
Well, they did.

13:18.604 --> 13:27.098
But from then on, they had this policy of...

13:28.934 --> 13:30.035
trying to control.

13:30.095 --> 13:34.719
What they want to do is to try and control any use that's made of any material that they own.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.361
You can't get photocopies out of them.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.243
Can you comment on this for me, by the way?

13:39.343 --> 13:40.965
I'd like a statement on this.

13:40.985 --> 13:41.725
What do you think?

13:42.026 --> 13:45.369
How do you react to this policy?

13:45.529 --> 13:50.213
Well, I think it's indefensible.

13:52.675 --> 13:58.300
The libraries, great libraries exist to make their collections,

13:58.600 --> 13:59.821
available to people.

14:00.802 --> 14:02.524
To promote the furtherance of scholarship.

14:02.584 --> 14:02.904
Yes.

14:02.924 --> 14:19.580
I mean, I think that one has to qualify what they say by saying that what they object to is people sending orders for photographs and photocopies from a distance and never going to see the originals.

14:20.121 --> 14:28.489
Well, I have a certain amount of sympathy with this, although, obviously, if you live in...

14:28.790 --> 14:31.995
or Melbourne or... Or Worcester, Massachusetts.

14:32.055 --> 14:34.639
Worcester, Massachusetts, which is far enough away.

14:34.699 --> 14:48.559
You have to reckon with the fact that there will be people who want to use this material and have at least some sight of it, who, for one reason or another, simply can't get you.

14:52.846 --> 14:57.092
Though they may deprive themselves

14:57.393 --> 15:25.257
of information they ought to have by trying to work from photographs do you think that's a valid point i i mean do you think that it can be i mean i think microfilm can be just as just as useful well it can but i mean there is a celebrated story of the man who tried to edit gerald manly hopkins's poems which were substantially corrected and worked over by robert bridges and because they had reasonably similar handwriting

15:25.642 --> 15:31.368
he made a number of deductions about them based on certain assumptions about their handwriting.

15:32.108 --> 15:41.658
And he discovered that if he'd seen the original instead of working from photographs, he would have found that Bridges used black ink and Hopkins used blue ink all the other way around.

15:42.198 --> 15:46.082
And that he got the difference between their hands all wrong.

15:46.522 --> 15:47.483
That's significant.

15:47.503 --> 15:50.226
Which is obviously a significant and important fact.

15:50.466 --> 15:51.968
He ought to have seen the original.

15:52.188 --> 15:55.311
And so, I mean, there are good reasons why one should see the original.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.695
How long ago was this, by the way?

15:58.735 --> 16:00.358
That's fascinating.

16:00.438 --> 16:01.259
I don't know.

16:01.279 --> 16:03.182
Sometime in the last 30 years.

16:03.202 --> 16:12.055
But to make it to ban... To make it hard and fast.

16:12.075 --> 16:12.796
...material.

16:12.836 --> 16:15.240
To tell the son of Robert Graves that he can't get...

16:15.473 --> 16:28.805
to tell Michael Holwright that if he wants to do his biography, he has to spend the whole time there, doing correspondence, stretching everything.

16:28.825 --> 16:35.050
Yes, but I mean, I'm not suggesting that some people are more deserving than others.

16:35.130 --> 16:37.572
It's a question of policy.

16:37.592 --> 16:44.198
Either you do let people have photographs of things, and we do let people have photographs of things, or you don't, or they don't.

16:44.988 --> 16:47.591
Are they alone, do you think, in this policy?

16:47.651 --> 16:49.012
Yes, to the best of my knowledge.

16:49.112 --> 16:52.075
I mean, people may have difficulties.

16:53.737 --> 17:10.675
I suppose there may be other places who have decreed that certain archives are under embargo for use by a particular student or by themselves, and there could be cases of that.

17:12.258 --> 17:13.499
Why do you think they do this?

17:13.519 --> 17:15.942
You think they just want people to come to Texas?

17:15.962 --> 17:17.664
They want that meeting?

17:17.684 --> 17:19.486
Well, it's a little difficult to say.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.988
I'm trying to figure this one out myself.

17:22.229 --> 17:27.955
I think that they do want people to come to Texas.

17:27.975 --> 17:32.600
But perhaps even more important, they want to... They want respect?

17:32.640 --> 17:35.483
They want respect from them.

17:36.283 --> 17:40.628
They want to make sure, I think, on the bottom line,

17:41.063 --> 17:43.907
that the goods mainly keep their scholarly value.

17:46.149 --> 17:54.500
And they've probably been told, but I don't believe it's necessarily true myself, that a book, once a book's been copied, whether it's been... Or manuscript.

17:54.520 --> 18:03.010
Or manuscript's been copied, whether it's been just simply transcribed or reproduced in fact civilly, it is devalued.

18:03.791 --> 18:09.518
I don't actually see this myself, and see not much evidence in the sale room,

18:10.443 --> 18:13.847
people pay less money for important letters.

18:13.987 --> 18:16.150
I collect Walker Percy, for instance.

18:16.451 --> 18:19.294
I just think he's a wonderful writer.

18:19.314 --> 18:26.203
And I have a few very interesting letters that he wrote very early, when the letterhead was still M.D., crossed out.

18:26.944 --> 18:32.050
And he was discussing Kierkegaard, who he quotes in the epigraph of the movie course.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.312
It's a very interesting letter.

18:34.253 --> 18:37.497
And I had somebody want a copy of it, and I

18:37.747 --> 18:38.728
copied it and sent it.

18:38.748 --> 18:43.194
And then I was later told by a dealer that I didn't previously, you know.

18:43.815 --> 18:44.656
And I said, why?

18:44.836 --> 18:45.657
What difference does it make?

18:45.697 --> 18:51.986
This guy was a psychiatrist and was, you know, was interested.

18:52.006 --> 18:57.673
And I said, it seems to me if he closed this letter, it makes my letter all the more valuable, I would think.

18:57.693 --> 19:02.980
Although value was not my motive for having it.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.686
But mainly the guy wanted it and he thought it was an extraordinary letter.

19:08.341 --> 19:15.211
And he wanted a copy of it, I copied it, but... But that's when I heard, you know, what difference does it make?

19:15.231 --> 19:19.977
You know, I own the original, that's what it sounds.

19:20.157 --> 19:24.564
So when I... It just seemed like a meaningless... I mean, I quite agree with you.

19:24.584 --> 19:36.340
But they do that there, and I have the explanation from Tom Staley, I won't try to paraphrase it, because I can't, but it's essentially what you... I mean, they have a rationalization for it.

19:36.843 --> 19:42.652
It exists as a unique... Well, anyway.

19:43.274 --> 19:45.056
But so Texas is one of my chapters.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.500
And I think it's a very interesting chapter.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.644
And it's pretty well put together, by the way.

19:49.684 --> 19:50.846
I think I have the information.

19:50.866 --> 19:52.168
You gave me a couple of quotes.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.963
I will use that indefensible word, if that's all right with you.

19:56.144 --> 19:56.585
You don't mind?

19:56.605 --> 19:57.226
Yes, yes.

19:58.088 --> 20:03.020
Because I think that I want to balance the... Yes, but I don't mind you saying that it's indefensible.

20:03.040 --> 20:03.421
Okay.

20:03.822 --> 20:07.771
You know, we're talking on tape, but I just want you to know that I would like to use that.

20:07.871 --> 20:07.992
Yes.

20:08.954 --> 20:10.798
Another chapter, which I think is my...

20:11.251 --> 20:16.476
my really great chapter is the Haven O'Moore Garden Sale.

20:16.496 --> 20:25.605
If you'd like to be brought up to date on that, if you're interested, I've really uncovered a lot of very fascinating information on that.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.486
I'll shut off a bit.

20:28.167 --> 20:40.279
I am particularly interested, and let's talk about, this is the British Library, and this is a national institution dedicated to the

20:40.613 --> 20:46.742
gathering and preservation of precious documents.

20:46.762 --> 20:48.664
Well, any document.

20:48.684 --> 20:50.086
Any document.

20:50.106 --> 20:51.328
I mean, again, precious.

20:51.568 --> 21:01.542
I'm also interested in the role that the private and individual collector has played toward the preservation of such things.

21:01.602 --> 21:09.473
And I walk into the reading room, and the first case I see is English literature number one, and of the nine items in there,

21:09.908 --> 21:12.952
Three or four are cotton, and a number of others are holly.

21:12.992 --> 21:19.261
And I think that we're talking here about two collectors who made a significant impact.

21:19.281 --> 21:22.865
For instance, I start there with an opening.

21:23.506 --> 21:26.150
What does the British Library owe to private collectors?

21:26.711 --> 21:31.857
Let's throw that out as a general question.

21:31.877 --> 21:36.303
Does the British Library owe to individual collectors?

21:36.323 --> 21:38.987
Well, obviously, we're immensely the richer.

21:39.608 --> 21:53.065
for a large number of private collectors over the years, bequeathing or giving us collections of books, as well as individual books.

21:53.105 --> 22:00.074
And we like to think that people will still want to go on doing that.

22:00.094 --> 22:05.161
We don't automatically have a copy of everything in the world.

22:05.301 --> 22:06.643
It's not that long time.

22:06.663 --> 22:08.485
Do you think that there are objects

22:10.220 --> 22:11.081
I see Beowulf.

22:11.141 --> 22:15.166
Would we have Beowulf if it weren't for cotton?

22:15.186 --> 22:20.152
Presumably not, no.

22:20.512 --> 22:26.460
Indeed, a good deal of early English literature comes from the cotton tract.

22:26.480 --> 22:33.007
I understand that Colin Tate is writing something on cotton.

22:33.027 --> 22:40.176
Are there... We're talking about cotton.

22:40.848 --> 22:41.249
Yes.

22:41.289 --> 22:42.791
He's a very interesting figure for me.

22:42.851 --> 22:43.171
Yes.

22:43.251 --> 22:48.598
A useful little biography of him was published the other day.

22:49.179 --> 22:51.362
Just published?

22:51.382 --> 22:53.004
I mean like within the last six months?

22:53.084 --> 22:55.027
Oh no, three years ago I'd say.

22:55.728 --> 22:56.890
You might find it useful.

22:57.510 --> 23:08.425
I mean the bibliophilic part of him was sort of summed up and I don't know if you've come across it but a book that some colleagues of mine and I put together called Treasures of the British Library

23:08.810 --> 23:10.793
Was that published by Abrams last year?

23:10.813 --> 23:11.634
It was, yes.

23:12.034 --> 23:13.116
It's wonderful.

23:13.136 --> 23:13.416
Yes.

23:13.536 --> 23:16.600
I quoted from it in my proposal to my publisher.

23:16.660 --> 23:23.289
It has sort of handy reaching down on the collections that have gone into this library.

23:27.114 --> 23:32.080
I am interested in... Is there much known about Cotton, the individual?

23:32.140 --> 23:35.405
He is said to be quite an idiosyncratic guy.

23:35.425 --> 23:38.108
Well, I mean, I think that most of the...

23:39.488 --> 23:48.358
Most of his individual characteristics were summed up in what we wrote then.

23:49.059 --> 23:58.710
I mean, he had a very strong sense of the importance of preserving relics of the past, which was unusual at the time.

23:59.170 --> 24:01.793
I look at the items of his that you have out there.

24:01.813 --> 24:03.375
They're also strikingly beautiful.

24:04.236 --> 24:05.618
Well, some of them are, yes.

24:05.658 --> 24:07.740
Not by any means all of them.

24:08.817 --> 24:11.039
Some of them, certainly.

24:11.059 --> 24:13.322
I mean, do you think he was a collector in the modern sense?

24:13.362 --> 24:16.025
No, certainly not.

24:16.045 --> 24:32.022
I mean, as I think we tried to make clear in the book, what he was, was a man with passionate belief and insisting for preserving the documentary records of the past.

24:32.042 --> 24:38.048
Rather for their evidential value from

24:38.618 --> 24:43.325
sort of political, social, and religious grounds.

24:43.345 --> 24:54.661
He saw that the preservation of the documents was a kind of defense against those who might attack the church and state, as he understood.

24:56.704 --> 25:06.297
He came... I thought he was a lot closer to the dissolution of the monasteries than he actually was, so there was quite a bit of discussion between them.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.261
Yes.

25:07.281 --> 25:16.893
I mean, he wasn't born until 1573 or so.

25:16.913 --> 25:18.375
So that's 40 or so years.

25:18.395 --> 25:30.891
So it was 40 years afterwards, and he was, in many cases, the people from whom he got things were people who had rescued them from the dissolution of the monastery.

25:30.911 --> 25:33.474
So there were people committed to the rescue.

25:33.494 --> 25:33.854
Oh, yes.

25:35.537 --> 25:36.638
We know the names of

25:37.242 --> 25:43.810
half a dozen people who evidently made an effort to preserve material.

25:44.972 --> 25:48.897
Is there any grasp on what was lost?

25:48.997 --> 25:52.561
I mean, do you think that there were lost werewolves, shall we say?

25:52.822 --> 25:53.723
Well, probably.

25:54.564 --> 26:05.157
I mean, werewolves might have gone missing at any point in any of the previous 500 years because Anglo-Saxon had ceased to be a

26:06.233 --> 26:34.097
live language very soon after the norman conquest and so the survival of manuscripts of any sort dating from that time was due to not to any more than the fact that people had no strong motive to destroy them but if they happened to fall off the back of a lorry nobody would

26:34.432 --> 26:37.275
talk with Lori to give back and pick them up.

26:37.415 --> 26:50.067
I went to Mr. Scheide's library in Princeton, by the way, which is quite an extraordinary year, by the library, and I spent a dazzling three hours in his company.

26:50.908 --> 26:57.975
He would take out, and we started with what he called Unhazard, the 42-line Bible.

26:58.115 --> 27:01.418
And then he took out

27:01.938 --> 27:06.404
his, what he said, is the only Anglo-Saxon text in North America.

27:07.346 --> 27:09.148
That's right, yes.

27:09.589 --> 27:15.918
And I think the exportation of that, did that occasion the passage of some legislation here?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.461
No, not as such.

27:18.342 --> 27:20.044
But that kind of slipped through the cracks, didn't it?

27:20.064 --> 27:22.247
I mean, that should not have left Great Britain.

27:22.268 --> 27:23.229
No, it shouldn't.

27:23.249 --> 27:23.870
It shouldn't.

27:23.890 --> 27:25.052
It was very sad that it did.

27:27.796 --> 27:29.498
And Bert and I was in a private...

27:29.967 --> 27:34.694
Well, no doubt in admirable hands.

27:35.775 --> 27:43.006
But it's sad to think that it was wonderful.

27:43.026 --> 27:53.881
To go back to Texas, because this brings Texas to mind, they claim a number of people down there, the woman, for instance, I can't think of her name, she has custody of me.

27:53.982 --> 27:55.564
She's a nice woman.

27:55.584 --> 27:57.747
She wrote the book Doubly Gifted, as a matter of fact.

27:58.942 --> 28:14.200
But she's the one who said, you know, that the British passed the legislation prohibiting the exportation of certain things, largely as, this is what they think down there, as a response to the Texas stuff.

28:14.220 --> 28:17.183
I mean, the legislation came in in the first decade of this century.

28:17.223 --> 28:18.605
So that's not true.

28:18.625 --> 28:18.945
Yeah.

28:18.965 --> 28:24.932
I mean, it's... They'd like to think... The great crisis was the...

28:26.279 --> 28:37.355
the proposed export of the picture of Queen Christina by Holbein, which caused a great sensation about 1905 or 1907.

28:37.375 --> 28:43.985
And there have been no more modifications to it as a response to this Texas stuff?

28:44.867 --> 28:45.708
No, certainly not.

28:47.010 --> 28:50.515
The basic legislation is in place, and that came in.

28:50.917 --> 28:51.538
85 years or so ago.

28:51.858 --> 29:11.328
Yes, I mean, the only things that get altered as money goes up is that there are certain parts of the legislation which relate to the value of the item being exported, and these levels get raised from time to time, but that's many a factor about money, not about the system.

29:12.830 --> 29:14.292
I will be doing

29:15.132 --> 29:18.976
Paying some attention to the informant, by the way.

29:19.076 --> 29:22.840
I'll be going out to Bloomington.

29:23.101 --> 29:30.308
I am looking into a number of individuals I've interviewed.

29:30.368 --> 29:31.690
Leonard Baskin, the artist.

29:31.790 --> 29:35.414
It's quite a very interesting collection.

29:36.094 --> 29:38.457
The magician, Ricky Jade.

29:39.027 --> 29:45.396
I'm hoping to... I'm trying to set up something with Larry Merchery, who's a political dealer.

29:45.416 --> 29:49.622
Interesting people who... You can see Larry Powell, of course.

29:49.642 --> 29:50.804
Larry Powell.

29:50.824 --> 29:54.249
He's the greatest bookman in America today.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.091
Who is he?

29:56.111 --> 29:56.372
I don't know.

29:56.392 --> 30:04.443
He was the librarian of UCLA for its great and crucial period of growth.

30:04.463 --> 30:07.768
And the last survivor of the...

30:08.710 --> 30:13.878
the great intellectual renaissance in Southern California.

30:15.220 --> 30:15.861
Larry Powell.

30:16.462 --> 30:17.503
Does he live in L.A.?

30:17.523 --> 30:18.685
No, he lives in Tucson.

30:19.086 --> 30:21.289
Okay, so now you have to go to Tucson.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.954
Everything you told me to do, by the way, in November, I have done.

30:27.318 --> 30:28.119
No, I can't say.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.423
I kept the mental nature of it, even.

30:31.304 --> 30:32.866
I hope I was helpful.

30:33.988 --> 30:37.333
I went to Texas.

30:37.533 --> 30:38.834
I went to see Bill Shaggy.

30:39.655 --> 30:41.177
Yes, yes, yes.

30:42.078 --> 30:44.781
And I'm presuming you've been to the Pierpont Morgan Library.

30:45.162 --> 30:46.844
Oh, I did.

30:47.204 --> 30:48.466
Several times.

30:49.086 --> 30:50.528
That I didn't have to be told.

30:50.548 --> 30:50.808
No.

30:53.291 --> 30:59.518
No, I mean, Ian Fleming is a matter of particular interest because, as you may know, I'm the editor of the Book Collector.

30:59.618 --> 31:01.601
I have every copy of that, by the way.

31:01.621 --> 31:01.941
Do you?

31:02.121 --> 31:02.341
Yes.

31:02.441 --> 31:04.804
I just succeeded putting together a full one.

31:04.984 --> 31:05.425
Well done.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.287
It did not come...

31:07.469 --> 31:08.370
inexpensively.

31:08.390 --> 31:16.783
No, no, I'm afraid not, but they come cheaper if you put it together yourself than if you... Well, I am now a subscriber.

31:16.803 --> 31:17.504
Good.

31:17.524 --> 31:34.710
But anyway, you know, Ian Fleming was the man who, as it were, well, he was the owner from whom I had to take the book collector over because he died very suddenly in 1964.

31:35.972 --> 31:36.953
And...

31:37.507 --> 31:41.091
Something had to be done to keep the book collector going.

31:42.433 --> 31:59.072
And I well remember going and seeing Mrs. Fleming and trying to help her deal with the problems of his library, which she never expected to get started with porn.

31:59.092 --> 32:02.737
That's a library that should perhaps have stayed in Great Britain.

32:04.819 --> 32:06.501
Um, no.

32:07.190 --> 32:07.811
Hardly.

32:07.911 --> 32:11.194
I mean... It's nothing that can't be replicated.

32:11.254 --> 32:15.298
Ninety percent of it is here, for example.

32:18.381 --> 32:23.426
But as a collection, it's... But as a collection, it's a very remarkable one.

32:23.546 --> 32:34.277
But it's not like Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, which are part of the...

32:35.270 --> 32:40.517
intellectual structure of the country, because Ian Fleming's collection was completely cosmopolitan.

32:40.537 --> 32:41.878
It came from all over the world.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.582
That was collected from all over the world.

32:45.102 --> 32:50.629
And so one couldn't claim the same sort of sense of belonging that Anglo-Saxon manuscripts did.

32:51.851 --> 32:56.376
Or modern English literary manuscripts, if it comes to that.

32:56.477 --> 33:01.823
Now, I've read the biography of Fleming, which could have been better done, I think.

33:01.923 --> 33:03.285
Yes, I think you're right there.

33:03.704 --> 33:05.606
I just thought about it an aside.

33:06.067 --> 33:14.478
It didn't tell me nearly as much as I thought... Well, it didn't make it... I mean, the trouble was that it's not the biography of Ian Fleming as we knew him at all.

33:15.079 --> 33:17.842
It's the biography of the author of the Bond stories.

33:19.044 --> 33:26.693
Well, obviously, to 99 people out of 100, Ian Fleming and the author of the Bond stories are the same person.

33:27.474 --> 33:28.716
But the other...

33:29.607 --> 33:40.000
one in a hundred who remembers him as many other things besides writing this very short period of his life when he was writing these immensely successful books.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.302
There's a great deal more to him.

33:42.003 --> 33:47.169
I think I've learned more about Fleming out of the book collector, shall I say.

33:47.630 --> 33:48.671
But there was a question.

33:48.711 --> 33:53.337
The one thing this fellow does suggest is that

33:53.840 --> 34:01.832
Fleming's collection really was the creation of Percy Muir, and that he totally lost interest in it when he was trying to sell it.

34:01.852 --> 34:02.853
Oh, no, that's nonsense.

34:02.873 --> 34:06.779
But that's the suggestion in that book, and I wonder if you could set the record straight on that.

34:06.799 --> 34:07.840
No, it's absolute nonsense.

34:07.961 --> 34:22.041
I mean, Fleming and Muir had been friends for many years, and before the collection was started, I mean, the collection grew out of the friendship, not the other way around.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.084
And... That's important, I think.

34:25.104 --> 34:25.484
Yes.

34:26.025 --> 34:37.137
And it certainly kept both of them occupied in different senses during the war.

34:37.197 --> 34:47.107
I mean, it's true that during the war, Percy had very little else to do and found it a welcome occupation to go look for books for Fleming.

34:47.848 --> 34:51.572
And Fleming, who was up for his years in...

34:51.974 --> 35:02.528
animal to intelligence, finding a pleasant relief from the stresses of the war to take half an hour off to talk to Percy about his book collection.

35:02.708 --> 35:07.915
And certainly after the war, it was very much a shared thing.

35:07.935 --> 35:16.947
And then, of course, when Ian died so suddenly, it fell on Percy to arrange his sales.

35:17.068 --> 35:20.412
The suggestion in the book is that he had been looking for a buyer.

35:20.797 --> 35:29.488
all along Fleming had been, and that maybe this was his hedge, and that he had lost interest in the collection, too.

35:29.709 --> 35:49.555
I mean, being the author of James Bond in the last, well, really, I suppose, only six years of his life, I mean, Casino Royale came out in 56, I think, but it wasn't for another couple of years that really the whole thing

35:50.058 --> 35:50.919
shot off.

35:50.939 --> 36:02.234
I mean, as he said to me, it was like being lashed to a balloon that was gaining helium.

36:02.254 --> 36:07.541
His sense that the whole thing had gone beyond his control was perhaps the most striking thing about it.

36:08.242 --> 36:12.187
I just don't think he had time to think about it.

36:12.207 --> 36:15.672
And, well, he acquired another life, another persona.

36:16.012 --> 36:17.314
Yes, he did.

36:17.374 --> 36:19.677
Not one of his own choosing.

36:20.264 --> 36:31.661
And not that I'm asking you to refute points in the book, but it's just that they do come to mind, and that I didn't even expect to talk about Fleming here, but I think a couple of quotes from you are really worthwhile.

36:33.264 --> 36:44.601
He also suggests that Fleming was obsessed with respect as a literary man for the quality of his writing, and not just the creator of the spot stories.

36:45.256 --> 36:45.656
That's right.

36:45.736 --> 36:47.478
I found this a very flawed biography.

36:47.498 --> 36:49.300
I was really very disappointed in it.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.262
I spent $25 for it.

36:51.322 --> 36:53.324
I think I overpaid.

36:53.424 --> 36:54.085
I think so.

36:54.986 --> 37:04.955
I mean, no, I mean, my own recollections of him are of him sort of amazed that people took this stuff seriously.

37:04.975 --> 37:06.037
Really?

37:06.057 --> 37:08.139
So that's totally off in your estimation?

37:08.159 --> 37:08.719
I would say so.

37:08.779 --> 37:14.605
I mean, I think he'd prefer...

37:14.990 --> 37:20.677
in the sense that, I mean, you know, he always said, well, he's most proud of writing it.

37:20.697 --> 37:28.666
He probably said the manual for Sunday Times Foreign Journalists, which he also wrote.

37:30.508 --> 37:32.291
Okay.

37:34.413 --> 37:38.778
I will be giving some very brief attention to T.J.

37:38.838 --> 37:41.942
Weiss, of course.

37:42.901 --> 37:53.995
It is interesting that Holbrook Jackson, in his Anatomy of Bibliomania, really doesn't pay much attention to the Cotter-Politik disclosure.

37:54.035 --> 37:54.816
But it hadn't come out.

37:56.238 --> 37:58.160
It hadn't come out?

37:58.180 --> 37:58.501
No, no.

37:58.961 --> 38:01.224
The Anatomy of Bibliomania came out before the inquiry.

38:02.886 --> 38:03.928
I'll have to check it again.

38:05.990 --> 38:06.831
Okay.

38:06.851 --> 38:12.098
That would obviously explain it, but it seems to me that... I mean, I bring this up because...

38:13.917 --> 38:19.763
you know, for all of this, why he's really made some significant contributions to book collecting.

38:20.643 --> 38:21.905
Oh yes, very much so.

38:23.626 --> 38:42.304
And Percy, you know, in one of those articles that he wrote, he said, I will not discuss, it is not my intention today to discuss the more nefarious disclosures regarding why I do want to talk about his contributions to taste and the collecting of books.

38:43.685 --> 38:48.251
I thought it was the anatomy of... It's 51, I think, isn't it?

38:48.391 --> 38:55.359
No, it's 1930... 1931.

38:55.379 --> 38:57.342
Third edition revised, 1932.

38:57.362 --> 38:57.522
Okay.

38:57.702 --> 39:03.309
So it was well before the... They were about 37, I guess.

39:04.411 --> 39:05.332
No, 34.

39:05.392 --> 39:09.056
So they were published in July 34th.

39:09.337 --> 39:09.557
Yes.

39:10.246 --> 39:11.768
I have a first of that, by the way.

39:11.948 --> 39:15.972
Well, see, I mean, the... Congratulations.

39:17.674 --> 39:23.681
But I mean, you know, Hobbrook-Jackson... No, it was no... ...couldn't possibly have known about it.

39:23.701 --> 39:26.884
Except that I am told that that was talked about for years and years.

39:27.705 --> 39:28.206
Not true.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.409
That people suspected it.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.672
No, not true again.

39:33.692 --> 39:38.397
Wise that there was a...

39:39.187 --> 39:51.986
There were a certain number of people in the book trade who, with good reason, suspected that Wise was a crooked man, in some sense of the word.

39:54.149 --> 40:01.900
But nobody had the faintest suspicion of what he had done until Dr. Impala came along.

40:03.002 --> 40:07.388
That's the greatest, really, bibliographic

40:07.840 --> 40:09.803
of the 20th century.

40:09.823 --> 40:10.564
It really is.

40:10.644 --> 40:11.585
It's quite extraordinary.

40:11.605 --> 40:12.286
Beyond any doubt.

40:13.287 --> 40:17.533
And you do both Carter and Paula?

40:17.593 --> 40:18.114
Yes, indeed.

40:19.315 --> 40:21.098
Could you tell me just a little bit?

40:21.298 --> 40:22.500
Well, not really.

40:22.740 --> 40:24.623
Because I've got about four books by Carter.

40:24.663 --> 40:26.465
He really is kind of one of my subjects.

40:26.505 --> 40:37.560
I would recommend you, I mean, the three people whom I bracket together in this

40:38.131 --> 40:45.603
league, so to speak, are Carter, Pollard, and Tim Munday, whom you must have heard.

40:45.623 --> 41:00.848
And if you turn to the pages of the booklet for that sad period from, I mean, Tim died, I think, on 26th of December 1974, and Graham

41:02.110 --> 41:07.875
I forget, it was in 1976, but in the space of about 18 months, all three of them were gone.

41:08.616 --> 41:15.301
And I wrote what I thought about all three of them in the book collector then.

41:15.321 --> 41:23.388
If you turn to your book collector, you'll find the... I just, by the way, five days before I left, the quake came in.

41:23.789 --> 41:27.432
Well, I mean, really, don't waste time asking me about them.

41:27.472 --> 41:30.054
What you have to say is there.

41:30.194 --> 41:31.375
Okay, good.

41:32.114 --> 41:36.820
How about, what do you have to say about Wise, though, as a contributor?

41:37.561 --> 41:49.156
Well... I mean, we have his libraries... Well, on the one hand, I mean, he was a very great collector of books, is certain.

41:50.157 --> 41:55.624
He was also...

41:58.321 --> 42:03.690
He was certainly not a clever man, he was a very energetic man, a very business-like man.

42:03.730 --> 42:06.995
He got through a great deal of work in his life.

42:08.939 --> 42:12.525
He didn't have any great sensibility for books.

42:20.197 --> 42:22.962
When somebody said to him,

42:23.397 --> 42:24.699
Well, in fact, A.W.

42:24.759 --> 42:25.780
Pollard, A.W.

42:25.800 --> 42:39.220
Pollard, who is in no relation, a very great figure in this library, when he was told that Weiss had been convicted of forgery.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.103
Not convicted.

42:41.283 --> 42:44.027
Well, I mean, the book had come out.

42:44.267 --> 42:45.569
That defamed him, certainly.

42:45.589 --> 42:48.653
Which accused him of forgery.

42:48.673 --> 42:51.818
He said, it can't be true, he hasn't got the intelligence.

42:52.658 --> 43:01.710
He wasn't very clever but he had very very very shrewd market sense.

43:02.111 --> 43:20.455
He basically amassed his collection on the profits of buying simultaneously for American collectors like Wren and many others and selling them dear

43:21.464 --> 43:25.447
and using the profits to buy his presentations.

43:25.768 --> 43:28.710
Didn't he actually get one... Was it Browning?

43:29.691 --> 43:29.931
No.

43:30.632 --> 43:42.182
Somebody to actually inscribe one of his... Well, both Swinburne and William Morris put their signatures on books at his request.

43:43.543 --> 43:47.546
And... Well, I don't think it's very amazing.

43:47.566 --> 43:50.509
I mean, authors aren't by nature very...

43:51.215 --> 43:54.439
curious of things.

43:54.459 --> 43:59.624
And you also have to remember that... But it gives it a provenance.

44:00.806 --> 44:02.347
Well, obviously that was the intention.

44:03.108 --> 44:12.478
And I mean, people were a lot less fussy about copyright a hundred years ago than they are now.

44:14.020 --> 44:17.324
I mean... Heresy was de rigueur, so to speak.

44:17.344 --> 44:18.745
Not unknown, certainly.

44:19.786 --> 44:21.188
And I mean, for example,

44:21.877 --> 44:40.835
Somebody, I think, in Aberdeen, somewhere in this country, read a piece of Ruskin, which he picked up in a provincial newspaper in New England somewhere.

44:40.855 --> 44:43.617
He'd been in America and read this piece of Ruskin.

44:43.657 --> 44:47.681
He thought it would be very, very good, and so he came back and reprinted it.

44:48.462 --> 44:50.584
Now, in doing so, of course,

44:51.256 --> 44:53.559
breached Ruskin's copyright.

44:53.779 --> 44:57.824
But I'm sure he had no intention of doing so.

44:57.864 --> 45:07.016
It was a genuine tribute to Ruskin, a desire to see that Ruskin's words were better known.

45:07.036 --> 45:19.491
And so that this, I won't say this excuses what Carter and Pollard did at all, but it does explain why, where it explains, for example,

45:19.859 --> 45:22.062
why people weren't more suspicious.

45:24.225 --> 45:29.751
He also managed to get some of these publications here into the British Library.

45:30.813 --> 45:33.937
Yes, he gave a good number.

45:34.137 --> 45:37.541
Which gave them a bibliographic basis, I guess.

45:38.823 --> 45:39.944
Yes, yes.

45:40.125 --> 45:42.007
Some bibliographic authority, I guess.

45:42.167 --> 45:44.410
Yes, I think that's absolutely true.

45:45.331 --> 45:48.415
And that was not, I mean, you said,

45:49.863 --> 45:53.108
One of your predecessors here said that he wasn't a very clever man.

45:53.128 --> 45:54.931
I think that was quite clever.

45:55.151 --> 46:01.742
And then he has since been found to have torn pages out of British Library books, which is inexcusable, of course.

46:01.762 --> 46:05.588
Yes, that's why we were all particularly worried about this man tonight.

46:07.831 --> 46:12.338
But having said all this, how do you judge his collection, which you continue to do?

46:12.378 --> 46:18.047
Well, it was, as Henry said, it was respectable in the 16th and 17th century.

46:18.803 --> 46:26.654
very great in the 18th century, and unequalled and unequalable in the 19th century.

46:28.918 --> 46:30.460
So he did have some taste, certainly.

46:31.541 --> 46:47.865
Well, no, I don't think he had any taste at all, but he did set himself to buy, to run down and put together all the books by all the famous authors in English literature that he lay hands on.

46:49.803 --> 46:56.753
Tell me just, and I know my time is running out, tell me just a little bit more about this fellow, Larry Powell, who you recommend, I see.

46:56.773 --> 46:58.075
Well, I mean, anybody will tell you.

46:58.136 --> 47:04.285
He's the greatest living collection builder.

47:05.246 --> 47:06.909
Institutionally.

47:07.009 --> 47:08.291
Institutionally, yes.

47:08.351 --> 47:10.053
He's an author himself.

47:11.856 --> 47:14.320
He's in his 80s now.

47:14.841 --> 47:19.067
And I revere and admire him as...

47:19.823 --> 47:29.257
as one of those sort of legendary figures of American... You say the greatest, you mean the greatest American or the greatest, you just throw that out as a phrase.

47:29.698 --> 47:38.471
Well, I mean, America has been a remarkable place over the last 50 years.

47:39.172 --> 47:47.004
I mean, it's been a great period of the growth of institutional collecting in the world.

47:48.065 --> 47:48.666
More books

47:49.237 --> 47:55.684
have moved from their previous homes to America than to any other place in the world.

47:56.084 --> 48:03.672
And Larry Powell was one of the greatest movers in that movement.

48:03.692 --> 48:06.375
Mainly, his contribution was to UCLA, he said.

48:07.856 --> 48:08.417
Yes.

48:08.617 --> 48:16.645
I mean, Los Angeles was his base, but Occidental College, now UA.

48:16.979 --> 48:20.884
He's had other places besides UCLA.

48:20.904 --> 48:25.470
Well, UCLA Library, which after all has some seven million books in it.

48:25.490 --> 48:27.532
It's one of the great libraries.

48:27.552 --> 48:30.896
I'm making a trick up that way, as a matter of fact.

48:31.157 --> 48:33.960
It's a monument to him.

48:33.980 --> 48:44.253
David Redden at Sotheby's said to me at one point that he believes we are embarking in a new golden age of book collecting.

48:44.273 --> 48:45.214
Would you agree with that?

48:46.308 --> 48:53.917
With respect to the fact that if you have the money, you can put together a world-class collection.

48:53.977 --> 48:55.058
I threw this to Ed Wolfe.

48:55.078 --> 49:00.825
He said, well, regardless of how much money do you have, he said, do you think you could get a full run of Shakespeare's Quartos?

49:01.746 --> 49:06.711
He said, we can't even get a full run of the Pennsylvania Gazette here at the Library Company.

49:06.731 --> 49:08.934
He said, I disagree with that, in short.

49:09.555 --> 49:11.957
Well, I don't know.

49:11.997 --> 49:14.180
I think I'd fool somewhere between the two.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.062
I mean...

49:16.615 --> 49:22.122
As things stand in the world today, no Lord knows how long it will last.

49:22.943 --> 49:25.326
Individuals are richer than institutions.

49:25.727 --> 49:33.296
There's been a swing against publicly funded bodies.

49:34.298 --> 49:46.133
And rich men are very much richer than they used to be pro rata.

49:46.653 --> 49:48.175
20 years ago.

49:48.796 --> 49:58.767
So that the balance of power has switched away from the institutions to the private collectors.

49:58.787 --> 50:00.510
What does this mean for the institution?

50:00.730 --> 50:01.391
Bad news.

50:01.631 --> 50:05.315
Very bad news.

50:05.656 --> 50:09.440
We don't expect to buy very much.

50:10.121 --> 50:12.304
We can't.

50:12.324 --> 50:15.968
Of course, the tax structure, certainly in the United States, they've made it really

50:16.842 --> 50:18.024
There's no angle.

50:18.484 --> 50:26.175
There's no incentive now for the collector to, there's no tax incentive anymore.

50:26.456 --> 50:29.260
You can't write it off the way you used to.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.923
They used to, yes, indeed.

50:31.963 --> 50:32.985
So therefore you sell.

50:35.869 --> 50:36.049
Yes.

50:36.730 --> 50:39.314
I mean, you can get some tax incentives still.

50:39.394 --> 50:40.515
But not like the old days.

50:40.535 --> 50:44.321
But not to the same extent that you used to.

50:44.882 --> 50:45.162
And

50:45.631 --> 51:09.090
I would imagine that an astute businessman who has, let us say, made an uncomfortable and unexpected and therefore unduly taxable profit in one year could still find it useful to

51:09.560 --> 51:18.513
give away his book collection as a means of diminishing excess profit tax.

51:18.533 --> 51:20.395
Okay.

51:21.437 --> 51:23.319
I think I've probably run to the end of my time.

51:23.600 --> 51:27.906
Well, I mean, I'd go on for another ten minutes.

51:28.386 --> 51:29.888
Okay.

51:31.170 --> 51:33.353
What title do you prefer using here?

51:33.654 --> 51:36.658
I'm just called Head of Select Materials.

51:37.539 --> 51:38.841
That's my official title.

51:39.412 --> 51:50.182
And you've been here for a mere trifle of 40 years.

51:51.022 --> 51:59.470
You are in an unusual situation where you edit the publication.

51:59.490 --> 51:59.850
Yes.

52:00.350 --> 52:04.714
And you really do speak for private book collectors.

52:06.196 --> 52:08.878
Well, the book collector is a forum.

52:09.348 --> 52:20.166
For the public, for the librarian, the private collector, and the bookseller to meet on equal terms.

52:20.427 --> 52:21.829
That's what it's about.

52:22.390 --> 52:31.986
So that it's not for, it's called the book collector, but it's directed equally at all three.

52:32.006 --> 52:32.807
To book men and women.

52:32.888 --> 52:33.128
Yes.

52:33.648 --> 52:39.078
From all three, as it were, branches of the book world.

52:39.339 --> 52:48.476
But my point is, where you say it's bad news for the institution, on the other hand, you still, I know you've told me that you're a book collector yourself.

52:49.558 --> 52:56.010
I think what you would, in a perfect world, we see the collectors still having

52:56.260 --> 52:56.720
Oh, yes.

52:56.881 --> 52:58.722
Everything shouldn't go into an institution.

52:59.122 --> 53:01.845
When I asked you about the flooding collection, I was kind of surprised.

53:01.865 --> 53:03.026
I said, too bad it didn't stay.

53:03.046 --> 53:03.867
It doesn't bother you at all.

53:03.887 --> 53:04.667
It doesn't bother me at all.

53:05.248 --> 53:09.311
And had it been bought en bloc by another collector, that would have worried me still less.

53:11.173 --> 53:11.513
No.

53:13.255 --> 53:24.985
Obviously, it seems to me that the greatest good is done to humanity by the largest number of books being available to it.

53:25.471 --> 53:31.597
The only question is how they're best made available, some of them.

53:31.617 --> 53:50.074
I mean, Bill Jackson, the very, very great librarian of the Houghton Library at Harbin, once sold the world's most perfect copy of Vaughan's Silex Scintillands, 1650, one or two, I think.

53:52.416 --> 53:54.718
On the grounds that this was a book

53:55.306 --> 53:58.850
too beautiful and too perfect for a public library to own it.

53:58.870 --> 54:05.076
It ought to be in a private collector's collection where it would be protected from too much use.

54:05.096 --> 54:07.419
Do you concur with that judgment?

54:09.821 --> 54:13.165
You wouldn't have recommended selling it, I'll bet.

54:15.547 --> 54:16.989
And they did sell it, I gather.

54:17.349 --> 54:18.070
They did sell it.

54:19.491 --> 54:24.857
Ironically, it's now returned with Bob Taylor's collection to Princeton.

54:25.073 --> 54:28.497
So it's gone, ultimately, to an institutional collection.

54:32.842 --> 54:36.907
I don't think you'll see Princeton put it out on the market any time soon.

54:36.927 --> 54:37.908
I should be surprised.

54:42.393 --> 54:50.102
Yes, I think nowadays people... I think a different principle comes into action, which is that people are much more

54:51.010 --> 55:02.186
alert to and sensitive to and can derive more information from individual copies of books than they can, than they used to be.

55:02.506 --> 55:08.315
I mean, in the day, in the old days, you'd say, I've got a copy of Silex, Sinterlands, full stop.

55:09.416 --> 55:14.824
Nowadays, people would say that my copy

55:15.209 --> 55:31.337
is interesting because it was the first copy that arrived in the USA, or my copy is interesting because it has a contemporary binding, or my copy is interesting because it was in the Zion College Library or something like that.

55:31.678 --> 55:35.164
But going back to Jackson, using that as a justification, why just that book?

55:35.224 --> 55:39.732
I think you could pick any number of exquisite things from the collections.

55:40.302 --> 55:41.884
sell them on that basis.

55:41.904 --> 55:45.107
It was the absolute mint affection of the condition.

55:45.167 --> 55:56.519
Now, you see, I mean, he had a very valid point, which is that in a public library, it was a necessity of things, that there is a greater chance that people will come and use and finger and touch things.

55:56.539 --> 55:57.600
It's happened this evening.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.603
Yes, it's happened this evening.

56:00.643 --> 56:08.412
That property, when it was in a private collection, in Grenville's collection, was, no doubt, in absolute mint condition.

56:09.393 --> 56:09.853
Now,

56:10.711 --> 56:17.577
150 years later, though lovingly cared for, it's been touched by too many people.

56:18.298 --> 56:23.683
And you are mandated to allow, one would hope, responsible people to touch that.

56:23.783 --> 56:37.056
Yes, I mean, in the case of the first failure of Shakespeare, 99% of people's requirements are met by the... The Norton fact simile, which I have, which is wonderful.

56:37.116 --> 56:38.237
Exactly, which is

56:42.706 --> 56:45.029
It's the ideal copy.

56:45.049 --> 56:46.371
It is the ideal copy.

56:46.551 --> 56:51.577
It's been reproduced to some of all copies of Shakespeare.

56:51.597 --> 56:55.642
That really is a justification for having duplicate copies, isn't it?

56:55.823 --> 56:59.347
Yes, yes, absolutely.

57:00.048 --> 57:11.903
And going back to what you were saying about the difference between Jackson's time and our time, it is the fact that people now realize that there are no such things.

57:12.457 --> 57:23.852
as duplicates, that every copy of every book has its own independent life, which distinguishes it from every other copy of that book.

57:23.872 --> 57:26.235
Well, what will happen now to the Taylor Library at Princeton?

57:26.275 --> 57:29.980
You think they will have to make that available to scholars?

57:30.321 --> 57:41.856
I mean, no, I would guess that the Taylor Library at Princeton is going to be rather the Michael Peake's Library at Moreland College, Cambridge, that only people

57:42.157 --> 57:49.665
with very, very strong credentials for seeing the books in it, are going to be allowed to touch them at all.

57:50.346 --> 58:05.541
And the people who wander into Princeton and say, I want to read Keats's poems, 1817, are going to be directed to another copy of Keats's poems, 1817, not the Taylor copy.

58:05.762 --> 58:06.662
As well they should be.

58:06.803 --> 58:07.984
As well they should be, yes.

58:08.164 --> 58:12.028
And what worries me about this evening's incident

58:12.683 --> 58:17.528
is the evident breakdown in the system which we thought.

58:17.688 --> 58:19.209
Something happened, yeah.

58:19.249 --> 58:20.370
Well, something lapsed.

58:20.671 --> 58:23.013
Something, something, something has slipped.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.154
That's what we put right.

58:24.274 --> 58:25.896
Things always slip and all the lapses.

58:25.916 --> 58:32.442
Well, Harvard has just issued, I don't know if I had a chance to see it, the facsimiles of the Keats poems.

58:35.625 --> 58:36.806
It's wonderful.

58:37.167 --> 58:39.509
That, of the Houghton Managers.

58:39.529 --> 58:40.730
Yeah.

58:41.011 --> 58:41.471
Beautiful.

58:41.511 --> 58:42.572
Helen Benley wrote a little book.

58:42.907 --> 58:48.912
I'm wondering if that will serve the scholar, or will the scholar still need access?

58:49.913 --> 58:54.217
I don't think Keats wrote in two different colorings, shall we say?

58:54.237 --> 59:04.546
No, but I'm sure it will be useful to have facts similar to Keats's manuscripts, because anybody's manuscripts are fascinating.

59:04.566 --> 59:11.952
I mean, every manifestation of a text is interesting, but obviously if

59:12.421 --> 59:29.215
The author, where you can, if you can get inside the skin of the author, actually see the pen shaping the letters, see where it decided halfway through a word that this was not the right word, and this would be the right word, and you can see what

59:29.566 --> 59:34.274
the word that first came to mind was, even though it was deleted halfway through the writing of it.

59:34.314 --> 59:39.863
Well, try and read Emily, try and understand Emily Dickinson without reading Emily Dickinson's manuscripts.

59:39.983 --> 59:42.307
Yes, yes, yes.

59:42.367 --> 59:52.785
I mean, because she had her own punctuation, she had her own... Well, I mean, seeing an Emily Dickinson manuscript adds a whole new dimension to one's appreciation of her picture.

59:52.805 --> 59:54.207
She's a different poet, I think.

59:54.322 --> 59:56.405
I love him.

59:56.605 --> 01:00:03.595
I think you're absolutely right, but one does get a very real feeling.

01:00:03.615 --> 01:00:20.278
I mean, after all, there's been a lot of argument in recent times about deconstructionalism is about all this, that actually no poem has the author's intentions are immaterial, what counts is

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.733
what it means to you.

01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:27.298
And this seems to me to be absurd.
