00:02.528 --> 00:03.169
Carl Sagan.

00:04.050 --> 00:06.072
Congratulations, sir, on a wonderful book.

00:07.554 --> 00:12.560
Tell me a little bit, if you would, do you see this as a sequel to Cosmos?

00:12.640 --> 00:31.523
It seems to me to be an independent project altogether, but... Well, you certainly don't have to have read Cosmos to read and understand Pale Blue Dot, but in the sense of continuing the story about what we've learned about our solar system and beyond, mainly by spacecraft,

00:32.026 --> 00:43.622
And looking at the big picture of the connection between humans and the cosmos, it is, in a way, a sequel.

00:43.642 --> 00:44.002
Okay.

00:45.104 --> 00:51.953
I have to say that the illustrations, the photographs here, are just absolutely wonderful.

00:51.973 --> 00:56.079
And they really do... They reproduce well for something published in the United States.

00:57.201 --> 00:59.344
The quality of the reproduction I was really impressed by.

00:59.384 --> 01:01.847
I've spent a lot of time I've picked up every one of those pictures.

01:02.688 --> 01:07.894
And you'd be amazed how many gorgeous pictures I didn't use.

01:07.914 --> 01:14.581
What an enormous portfolio of wonderful, dazzling images that has come out of the space program.

01:14.701 --> 01:19.066
And I think what is really significant is how recent so many of these are.

01:19.766 --> 01:29.056
And very early in the book, when you give us the figure that's 70 new worlds, it's an astonishing number, isn't it?

01:29.076 --> 01:30.238
It really is.

01:30.258 --> 01:30.518
It really is.

01:31.038 --> 01:42.556
There's only one moment in human history when, for the first time, we examine, close up, the other worlds that share our solar system with us.

01:42.816 --> 01:46.602
And we are privileged to be alive at that moment.

01:46.622 --> 01:50.588
No other generation has that footprint.

01:50.608 --> 01:55.155
Towards the back of the book, you show the footprint of the Moon and you say, well, if undisturbed...

01:55.760 --> 01:58.943
It will be intact for a million years or more.

01:59.864 --> 02:02.707
You really get a sense of time, don't you?

02:02.767 --> 02:06.231
One of the many benefits of astronomy.

02:06.251 --> 02:24.771
It gives you a sense of our coordinates in space and time and the conceit that we are at the center of the Universe and that we have been here since the beginning, both for

02:25.274 --> 02:30.761
heavily when confronted with the reality of modern science.

02:30.781 --> 02:34.927
I didn't realize that this was your suggestion to have the camera pointed back.

02:36.148 --> 02:42.196
I was an experimenter on the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft.

02:42.216 --> 02:47.443
This was something I had wanted to do from shortly after launch in 1977.

02:49.366 --> 02:50.647
Finally, I got to do it.

02:52.690 --> 02:54.893
What I like so much about it is that

02:55.312 --> 02:59.799
From a scientific standpoint, it's basically, it has very little value.

02:59.899 --> 03:10.116
But I think from an intellectual's standpoint, it really does put the whole thing into perspective, doesn't it?

03:10.536 --> 03:13.441
Yeah, just what I had imagined would be the case.

03:14.343 --> 03:22.095
It seems so beautiful, so fragile, that baby blue.

03:25.028 --> 03:27.231
I don't understand that sunbeam, though.

03:27.932 --> 03:30.016
It's simple.

03:30.276 --> 03:38.188
You know how if you look at a light bulb and squint, you see little rays coming out of the light bulb?

03:38.709 --> 03:39.189
Right.

03:40.411 --> 03:42.755
You can manipulate the rays by squinting.

03:43.035 --> 03:43.656
Okay.

03:44.377 --> 03:46.340
Well, it's just that.

03:46.641 --> 03:54.192
There was an object on the spacecraft between the camera and the Earth.

03:54.425 --> 03:55.006
I see.

03:55.086 --> 03:59.710
And so it produced that diffraction spike.

03:59.730 --> 04:07.217
And if you waited a little bit for the geometry change a little bit, then the spike would be off in a different direction.

04:08.078 --> 04:09.539
Just by good luck we had it.

04:09.819 --> 04:13.202
It's astonishing, isn't it?

04:13.222 --> 04:21.290
And I guess when it came time to title this book, and of course that does give the whole book, I think it's the central metaphor, doesn't it?

04:21.670 --> 04:23.732
Yeah, that was certainly my thing.

04:23.792 --> 04:23.892
Yeah.

04:24.108 --> 04:32.644
I guess another reason I love it is because it seems to suggest, pardon me, just basically what you're about.

04:32.664 --> 04:39.637
I mean, you're a scientist, of course, primarily, but you never seem to lose your enthusiasm.

04:39.677 --> 04:46.470
You never seem to, the sense of wonder and awe seems to be with you throughout everything you do.

04:47.092 --> 04:58.708
In some other job, it might not have been the case, but how can you be out there exploring the planets and not be subfused with wonder and awe?

04:58.728 --> 05:02.493
You have to be a block of wood not to feel that.

05:02.513 --> 05:08.841
You also mentioned early on that you basically spent a year on Mars, and this kind of follows what you just said.

05:08.861 --> 05:13.047
I mean, you are exploring planets, aren't you, even though you're Earth-bound, so to speak.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.310
Yeah, and that's...

05:15.442 --> 05:17.364
That's because robots are so capable.

05:18.165 --> 05:35.522
And as I describe in the book, as virtual reality and artificial intelligence start moving to their own, everybody will be able to explore planets merely worlds.

05:35.542 --> 05:41.668
No more than those worlds with robot explorers and without human explorers.

05:43.083 --> 06:10.778
um also give me some uh if you would if you talk a bit about you know your the anxiety that you have that this is all being just just abandoned uh you do make a pitch in the concluding chapters of the book for uh the uh yes yes was uh you know for humans basically clearly the high point uh mythic achievement uh

06:11.213 --> 06:26.594
and something that will be remembered a thousand years from now when no one will have any idea what Gatton stands for, who the Speaker of the House was in the last few years of the 20th century.

06:26.614 --> 06:39.432
When things like that are confined to dusty archives, when nobody remembers what's happening in Somalia or Bosnia or Haiti, people will remember Apollo 4.

06:40.002 --> 06:43.307
the moment that humans first set foot on the world.

06:44.088 --> 06:57.809
And they'll remember all the mariners and Vikings and voyagers that swept through the entire solar system, gave us the preliminary reconnaissance of the region in which we live.

06:57.829 --> 07:01.435
But Apollo served mainly political purposes.

07:01.515 --> 07:06.803
It was mainly about their arms race and beat the Russians and intimidate other nations.

07:07.441 --> 07:11.106
As soon as we did beat the Russians, the program ended.

07:11.126 --> 07:15.052
There was no continuing political purpose for it.

07:15.072 --> 07:33.298
And while we still have a reasonably vigorous robotic program, the human program, the so-called manned program, I don't like the word because they're women astronauts, the human program is in a very desultory state.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.043
We're constantly launching shuttle

07:37.630 --> 07:42.875
200 miles up with a crew of five or six or seven in a tin can.

07:43.816 --> 07:49.622
And they launch a communications satellite which could just as well and much more safely be launched by an unmanned booster.

07:49.642 --> 07:55.387
And then we hear the newts are reproducing nicely, thank you, or the tomato plant didn't grow.

07:56.268 --> 08:00.332
And then they come down and they say, another Triumph NASA exploration.

08:00.352 --> 08:01.553
Well, this is not exploration.

08:01.573 --> 08:02.854
This is driving a bus.

08:03.695 --> 08:07.519
And 200 miles, 200 miles is...

08:08.275 --> 08:11.238
I mean, Boston is farther from New York than 200 miles.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.040
That's right, isn't it?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.542
It's about the same, yeah.

08:15.822 --> 08:17.804
I'm a 180-mile drive myself.

08:18.184 --> 08:30.095
Imagine somebody driving a bus back and forth between Boston and New York for a few dozen times and having the delusion that that was exploration.

08:31.236 --> 08:35.380
Whereas, if NASA had continued...

08:36.068 --> 08:37.570
to explore other worlds.

08:37.710 --> 08:47.785
If we had gone to near-Earth asteroids, if we had been able to go to Mars, public enthusiasm for this kind of exploration would be unabated.

08:48.446 --> 08:50.589
I'm not saying it's NASA's fault.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.333
The directions come from the top.

08:55.155 --> 09:00.523
But we are not doing anything like exploration, and exploration is what is fundamental.

09:03.693 --> 09:08.759
What would you like to see, I mean, in your lifetime, realistically?

09:09.379 --> 09:10.981
And that's just an open-ended question.

09:11.001 --> 09:15.186
In terms of your technological orientation?

09:15.206 --> 09:16.868
Out there, yeah.

09:16.888 --> 09:19.430
Or scientific discoveries in space?

09:19.711 --> 09:20.452
All of the above.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.675
But basically, from out there, what would you like us?

09:24.256 --> 09:30.763
I'd like to see a vigorous program.

09:30.997 --> 09:39.187
of monitoring the environmental health of the Earth and that we are about to move into that epoch.

09:39.207 --> 09:57.128
I'd like to see a serious inventory of all near-Earth asteroids that might one day hit the Earth and the big ones could threaten the global civilization.

09:57.148 --> 10:00.092
It's just foolish of us not knowing.

10:00.764 --> 10:06.050
Well, coincidentally, didn't we just have one come by a couple of weeks ago or a couple of days ago?

10:06.270 --> 10:06.991
Yeah, that's right.

10:07.492 --> 10:22.249
But the real lesson this year is the impact of comet Shoemaker leaving mine with Jupiter, in which we saw one kilometer object slamming into Jupiter and making disturbances on an Earth-sized scale.

10:22.829 --> 10:23.090
Wow.

10:23.290 --> 10:29.657
And that's a reminder that a one kilometer comet slamming into the Earth can produce global environmental consequences.

10:30.886 --> 10:34.050
serious natures.

10:34.070 --> 10:37.534
So this goes beyond politics, doesn't it, and national pride and all that other?

10:37.614 --> 10:38.215
Exactly.

10:38.295 --> 10:40.818
And all nations have an equal stake.

10:42.560 --> 10:53.412
And in fact, I believe that in the long term, this is one of the reasons that forces our end, that requires us to have a significant presence in space.

10:53.432 --> 10:57.777
So that when we identify one of these, it's on an impact trajectory.

10:57.797 --> 10:59.239
And sooner or later, we won't.

11:00.012 --> 11:01.814
that we have the ability to do something.

11:02.976 --> 11:09.403
I would like to see a more vigorous program of robotic exploration.

11:10.685 --> 11:28.146
I'd like to see us moving more swiftly into intimate cooperation with the Russians, the Europeans, and the Japanese in joint space programs on behalf of the human species in a time of declining budgets.

11:28.885 --> 11:36.212
with this enormous technological and intellectual capacity of those other nations.

11:36.232 --> 11:42.118
It's just foolish of us to keep imagining going on and on.

11:42.138 --> 11:54.330
And I'd like to see the human space program not accelerated, but just focused on the long-term goal of humans living in the space environment, and that we don't do that.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.192
So that's what I would...

11:56.729 --> 11:58.851
what I would say, programmatically.

11:59.211 --> 12:20.650
In terms of discoveries, what... In terms of discoveries, I can tell you what the three most interesting possibilities for me are, all of which are technically, you know, I grasp and may happen tomorrow or something.

12:20.670 --> 12:24.793
First of all, I'd like to know, is the universe open or closed?

12:24.813 --> 12:25.774
Will we...

12:26.665 --> 12:34.032
The galaxies continue to recede from each other until the universe is essentially depopulated.

12:35.654 --> 12:41.600
Or will the expansion slow stop be replaced by a contracting universe?

12:41.620 --> 12:50.328
And this has enormous philosophical and geological implications.

12:50.608 --> 12:56.554
Secondly, and that's within our grasp, the ability to make that decision, that determination.

12:57.732 --> 13:07.845
Secondly, I'd like to see a comprehensive inventory of the planetary systems around the nearest few hundred stars.

13:09.507 --> 13:10.929
And we're just on the verge of that.

13:10.969 --> 13:15.354
We have a bona fide, the first bona fide extrasolar planetary system.

13:16.035 --> 13:17.277
That's exciting, isn't it?

13:17.297 --> 13:17.777
Yeah.

13:17.877 --> 13:22.423
And, you know, if you don't have any other systems, you don't know how...

13:23.332 --> 13:30.222
Typical yours is you don't know much about your own origins because who knows if it was a fluke of some sort.

13:31.904 --> 13:36.791
But if you have a few dozen or a few hundred other systems, then you can compare.

13:37.412 --> 13:43.200
And also there's the obvious question of are there Earth-like worlds there and is there life on them?

13:43.320 --> 13:47.366
And even that could be determined remotely, spectroscopic.

13:47.386 --> 13:47.466
Wow.

13:48.247 --> 13:53.254
And then finally, something I've worked on for a long time,

13:53.403 --> 13:59.973
use of large radio telescopes to see if anyone's sending us a message.

14:00.033 --> 14:06.924
Speaking of telescopes, of course, you just mentioned radio telescopes, but you might give me a comment on the extraordinary success recently of Hubble.

14:08.527 --> 14:08.627
Yeah.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.409
That is really exciting, isn't it?

14:10.790 --> 14:12.693
The Discovery a Week Club.

14:12.713 --> 14:13.614
It's amazing, isn't it?

14:15.077 --> 14:19.123
Not trivial, but just fundamental, basic stuff.

14:19.593 --> 14:27.403
And some of it just doesn't, you know, even make it into the papers because how many major discoveries can they prepare?

14:29.546 --> 14:41.222
Yeah, it's... And hats off to the human crews who fitted the corrective contact lens.

14:41.762 --> 14:45.728
That's amazing, isn't it?

14:45.788 --> 14:48.351
That may actually be the...

14:49.057 --> 14:50.279
one way to go, too.

14:50.359 --> 14:59.857
I mean, in tandem with other ways, I would think, is to keep... I don't know what the lifespan of Hubble is, but... Oh, it's years, and it's refurbishable.

14:59.877 --> 15:00.298
Is that right?

15:01.080 --> 15:01.180
Yeah.

15:01.200 --> 15:01.661
That's great.

15:01.761 --> 15:02.863
So once it's...

15:04.109 --> 15:11.625
Up there, of course, the book itself, I have to say, speaks most eloquently for itself.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.870
I really don't have to take up too much of your time today.

15:13.890 --> 15:17.338
I did want to get some quotes, which we have.

15:18.641 --> 15:22.489
It's foolish to ask you questions about things that you've already...

15:22.469 --> 15:26.939
But if you could let me go a little earlier, I'd appreciate it, just because I have to catch up on you.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.806
Okay, well, you know what, I think... I'm happy to talk with you a little more.

15:29.906 --> 15:34.536
I think I do have plenty of quotes, and again, we have the book, and it's just a pleasure to talk to you.

15:35.238 --> 15:39.668
Okay, I do have one question, if you don't mind, and it's not mine, but it's one of my newspapers.

15:40.323 --> 15:52.279
my newspaper in Allentown, The Morning Call, and he asked me if I would ask you how you respond to the beating that you get from people like Ruck Schlembach.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.101
And I never listened to the show.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.263
I don't know what he's talking about.

15:55.443 --> 15:58.848
I'm deeply unaware of any substantive criticism.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.531
Yeah.

16:01.551 --> 16:02.853
It doesn't mean anything.

16:03.033 --> 16:08.220
I know we differ on his environmental issues.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.722
And there are...

16:10.023 --> 16:12.547
I'm happy to make a general question.

16:13.007 --> 16:24.063
I don't understand what it is that conservatives are conserving if they're not vitally interested in the environment that sustains all of us.

16:24.083 --> 16:24.384
Great.

16:25.486 --> 16:26.487
That's a wonderful quote.

16:28.049 --> 16:28.430
Excellent.

16:30.012 --> 16:31.574
Doctor, I'm going to let you go catch your plane.

16:31.594 --> 16:31.775
Okay.

16:32.055 --> 16:33.117
Thank you very much for your time.

16:33.157 --> 16:34.018
Terrific, Doctor.

16:34.038 --> 16:34.439
Take care.

16:34.499 --> 16:34.919
Thank you, sir.

16:35.039 --> 16:35.440
Bye-bye.
