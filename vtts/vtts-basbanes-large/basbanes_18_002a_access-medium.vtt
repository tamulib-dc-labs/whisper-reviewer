WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:03.193
There we go.

00:03.213 --> 00:06.057
Okay, we're talking to Eric Craft here.

00:07.118 --> 00:08.560
Congratulations on yet another.

00:09.060 --> 00:09.501
Thank you.

00:12.104 --> 00:14.847
We've done this now about four times, haven't we?

00:15.028 --> 00:15.909
I think so.

00:16.670 --> 00:18.973
It's not easy coming up with a new angle, but I'll tell you.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.897
Well, let me just pour this martini, Nick, before we get there.

00:22.917 --> 00:23.578
There we go.

00:23.879 --> 00:24.720
All right, now I've got that.

00:24.740 --> 00:25.300
Have you got yours?

00:26.061 --> 00:26.822
It's a little early.

00:26.842 --> 00:29.646
You're kidding me, right?

00:29.966 --> 00:30.747
I am.

00:32.228 --> 00:39.395
I thought we should try to put this interview in the same context.

00:39.495 --> 00:44.360
Well, they usually do flow a little better, don't they, under those circumstances.

00:45.081 --> 00:52.428
I guess what I'm looking for here, and for reasons that I'll explain as we go along, I'm really looking for a Long Island ambiance.

00:52.989 --> 00:54.030
Oh, yeah.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.893
And maybe you can tell me about your little world down there.

00:57.233 --> 00:59.215
Just talk, okay, and if there's something...

00:59.195 --> 01:01.218
I want to direct you.

01:01.478 --> 01:06.185
I mean, we've got the book, obviously, so I'm not going to question you specifically about the book.

01:06.205 --> 01:09.050
But just talk a little bit about Long Island and this world.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.051
I will.

01:10.311 --> 01:10.692
I will.

01:10.832 --> 01:16.420
And, you know, that reminds me of something that I'm going to tell you now so that I don't forget to tell you later.

01:17.222 --> 01:27.717
A contact for you here as a source of ideas for other people that you might want to interview for Hampson's Magazine, for instance.

01:28.270 --> 01:33.496
is Kaneo Pavone or Pavone.

01:34.497 --> 01:38.362
I'm not quite sure how his last name is pronounced.

01:38.382 --> 01:38.582
P-A-V-O-N.

01:38.602 --> 01:40.284
Are you sure it's not Carmine?

01:40.304 --> 01:42.807
No.

01:42.827 --> 01:50.116
He is the owner of Kaneo's book.

01:50.957 --> 01:51.778
What's the name of it again?

01:52.659 --> 01:53.620
Kaneo's book.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.621
C-O-N?

01:54.661 --> 01:57.805
I-O apostrophe S. Okay.

01:58.358 --> 01:59.480
in Sag Harbor.

01:59.520 --> 02:07.992
It's a bookshop, very literary, and a magnet for the whole literary community out here.

02:08.053 --> 02:08.754
Okay, good.

02:08.994 --> 02:16.044
The address is Post Office Box 1962, Sag Harbor, New York, 11963.

02:16.165 --> 02:16.786
Okay.

02:19.810 --> 02:24.417
And the number is 516-725-

02:25.072 --> 02:29.945
And give me Konyo's last name again.

02:30.386 --> 02:33.054
Pavone, P-A-V-O-N-E.

02:33.254 --> 02:33.836
Okay.

02:33.856 --> 02:36.322
And everyone calls him Konyo.

02:36.343 --> 02:36.904
Konyo.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.925
C-A-N-I-O, C-A-N-I-O, C-A-N-I-O.

02:40.045 --> 02:41.587
He kind of says C-A-N-I-O.

02:42.108 --> 02:48.235
It reads C-A-N-I-O, but we call him C-A-N-I-O, like the con of a ship.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.376
Okay, that's good.

02:50.858 --> 03:00.630
He's a delightful guy, and if there is anybody who sort of knows everybody in the literary community, it's Satan.

03:00.948 --> 03:05.575
Well, they're looking for me for a list of ideas.

03:06.276 --> 03:09.742
I'm going to do one slam-bang opener.

03:09.782 --> 03:14.489
It's about 98% I'll be writing for them this summer.

03:15.231 --> 03:17.995
Chris, I really got to pitch local ideas.

03:17.975 --> 03:19.617
I think it will work out real well.

03:20.037 --> 03:20.237
Yeah.

03:20.257 --> 03:21.038
But anyway, let's talk.

03:21.558 --> 03:21.799
Go ahead.

03:22.459 --> 03:29.025
Talk about your world down there, your fictional world, and wherever you want to take it, okay?

03:29.566 --> 03:29.666
Okay.

03:30.407 --> 03:32.589
This may take a couple of phone interviews, by the way.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.511
That's fine.

03:34.531 --> 03:41.317
The real world, first of all, is just idyllic.

03:41.958 --> 03:45.501
I am sitting here in my workroom now,

03:46.190 --> 04:02.967
at the computer screen, and if I raise my eyes above the screen, I look out through two enormous windows in the open upper part of our living room at Three Mile Harbor, which is a bay, really.

04:03.167 --> 04:10.695
There are no boats in it now, but I'm looking across town land.

04:11.452 --> 04:17.479
Just dunes and trees and beach grass at the empty harbor.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.784
And it's still kind of cold and bare.

04:24.346 --> 04:28.771
Later on in the summer, they're both bobbing at their moorings.

04:28.971 --> 04:30.213
Are you native to this area?

04:30.653 --> 04:31.033
No.

04:32.135 --> 04:34.337
I grew up in Babylon.

04:35.077 --> 04:42.184
It's on the south shore of Long Island, on the Great South Bay, about halfway out from New York City.

04:42.204 --> 04:43.845
Well, you're native to Long Island.

04:43.945 --> 04:44.866
Long Island, yes.

04:44.886 --> 04:46.127
But this is another world.

04:46.227 --> 04:47.148
Okay.

04:47.168 --> 04:49.090
Well, that's a good quote.

04:49.110 --> 05:01.922
This East Hampton, the Hamptons area, the whole East End, have a kind of combined feeling about them.

05:01.942 --> 05:04.324
There's a strong element of New England.

05:05.114 --> 05:15.148
here, that there is not on the rest of the island, which EastEnders refer to as Up Island.

05:15.809 --> 05:32.792
And yet there is some of the Long Island feeling too, and so it isn't quite an outpost of New England any longer, although it originally was established as a

05:33.380 --> 05:41.331
stopping off point for whalers and the

05:41.851 --> 05:45.816
One of the local high school teams still calls themselves the Whalers.

05:46.557 --> 05:50.222
Well, you know, the counties are... They want to examine the political correctness.

05:51.084 --> 05:55.269
Well, you know, going back on the names of counties, Dukes is Martha's Vineyard.

05:55.329 --> 06:00.236
Dukes, Duchess, Kings, and, you know, they were all part of the original scheme.

06:00.937 --> 06:01.378
Right.

06:01.398 --> 06:01.558
Yeah.

06:02.439 --> 06:03.340
Before there were states.

06:04.963 --> 06:05.083
Right.

06:05.103 --> 06:05.463
But go ahead.

06:05.624 --> 06:08.888
And so, now...

06:09.357 --> 06:38.622
In fact, just having been back in the New England area, again, we, returning here, saw how much of a mixture this is, that there is an almost indefinable element of New England life that you see manifested in so many things, partly in architecture, architecture,

06:39.378 --> 06:49.030
a little bit in the speech patterns and accents of people from families that have been established here for a long time.

06:50.171 --> 07:00.323
And yet there is a kind of go-go rush and breathlessness about the area.

07:01.923 --> 07:04.686
That is certainly all New York.

07:04.707 --> 07:10.193
Okay, but now when you conceived of this world, Peter Leroy's world, you were living up here, right?

07:10.354 --> 07:10.594
Right.

07:11.415 --> 07:22.609
And tell me a little bit about, this was the Long Island of your youth, certainly, that was influencing your creative processes here.

07:24.692 --> 07:26.835
And now you've returned to it.

07:27.435 --> 07:27.555
Right.

07:27.575 --> 07:29.618
And maybe you can talk a little bit about that.

07:30.188 --> 07:38.878
Certainly, the world that I found myself creating started with what I remembered.

07:39.879 --> 07:57.158
And I have used the streets and little byways of Babylon, especially the area where my grandparents lived, both sets of grandparents, as the map.

07:57.425 --> 08:00.909
of Babington, or at least I did to start.

08:01.971 --> 08:15.407
And, you know, it may have been a touch of homesickness when I was in college that first got me thinking about reconstructing a childhood.

08:15.888 --> 08:25.980
But as Peter Leroy began to become an individual and a more fully realized character,

08:27.074 --> 08:32.198
So the town of Babington became something quite different from Babylon.

08:35.581 --> 08:54.357
Maybe I was only blind to it, but I would say that when I look back only with my memory and not with my imagination, I don't recall that the citizens of Babylon were as eccentric a bunch as the citizens of Babington.

08:54.377 --> 08:56.659
Now, maybe I just didn't know, but I...

08:57.466 --> 09:15.551
There is, of course, the fact that I am in control of the town of Babington, and so in a sense responsible for all of our citizens, and I'm careful of them.

09:15.571 --> 09:21.800
But how tight a rein do you hold on what they do, on the way they live their lives?

09:22.180 --> 09:25.465
Yeah, they're a willful bunch.

09:25.867 --> 09:46.938
I find, just as Peter finds, that he may give them a nudge and set them in motion, but they are inclined to divigate, to wander from the path that he might set them on, and to take unpredicted turnings.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.582
That certainly is true for me, too.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.385
Okay.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.172
Tell me about the creation of the new character.

09:55.332 --> 09:57.975
Let's tie in the current book.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.396
We'll jump around a little bit.

09:59.456 --> 10:02.500
Yeah, that's fine.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.563
Ariane has been a part of the story for quite a while now.

10:06.504 --> 10:16.795
Actually, she originated as I built a family around her youngest brother.

10:17.876 --> 10:20.899
Her youngest brother, Rodney,

10:21.098 --> 10:30.675
who is known as Rascal, short for Raskolnikov, his nickname, came along.

10:30.956 --> 10:39.671
He's one of those characters who kind of wandered into the story the way Dudley Beaker did, the fellow who lives next door to Peter's maternal grandparents.

10:42.697 --> 10:44.119
Peter had other friends.

10:44.656 --> 10:45.177
Certainly.

10:45.618 --> 11:00.223
But Rascal came along as a kind of rogue, sort of boy outlaw, not in the sense that he was an evil character, but that he was a little beyond adult control.

11:01.545 --> 11:03.188
And this was...

11:03.944 --> 11:05.466
Very attractive for Peter.

11:06.468 --> 11:16.882
The way it is for a lot of kids, I think, you know, the idea of an older, more capable friend who may get you into a little trouble if you don't watch out.

11:18.184 --> 11:26.876
So it was in thinking about him and developing him as a character that I began building his family around him.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.461
Now, these people are based on absolutely no one.

11:31.723 --> 11:31.943
Mm-hmm.

11:32.834 --> 11:49.131
As is the case in the affection that Peter feels for his grandparents, the friendship, the camaraderie that Peter and Rascal share is based on the kind of friendships I had with kids when I was Peter's age.

11:49.572 --> 11:53.796
But Rascal's not based on any person from my past.

11:54.176 --> 12:00.563
However, I have a friend of longstanding who became my friend

12:00.863 --> 12:12.955
later in life than Peter has befriended Rascal, but roughly in junior high school or so, who is absolutely certain that he's Rascal.

12:14.377 --> 12:27.630
So certain that he has begun to appropriate some of the anecdotes from the books as memories from his own life.

12:28.859 --> 12:39.357
It's not merely a case of life imitating art, but of sort of life borrowing from art to reconstruct itself.

12:39.377 --> 12:54.883
But Ariane was at first just part of the background that when I imagined the Lodkuchnikov family, there they were in that rickety house

12:55.252 --> 13:03.599
on the banks of the estuarial stretch of the Bellotomy with the stench of the tidal flats whenever the tide was out.

13:04.180 --> 13:12.307
And I could see them gathering there, and they were around on the periphery of the dining room, say, as they were coming in for dinner.

13:13.268 --> 13:17.451
And there were the mother and father very clearly.

13:18.372 --> 13:24.938
And those two lugs, the witless brothers, the two Ernie's,

13:25.542 --> 13:34.952
And then kind of the last one to come to the dinner table wearing a slip was Ariane.

13:35.453 --> 13:48.407
And she seemed to sleep a lot and she seemed just terribly seductive to 10-year-old Peter, which he was, that's how old he was when he first encountered her.

13:50.550 --> 13:52.832
I think I knew from the first time

13:53.251 --> 13:59.400
that I saw that she was part of that family, that eventually she was going to have to have a book of her own.

14:00.402 --> 14:03.406
How many books are there now in this cycle altogether, would you say?

14:04.047 --> 14:06.892
There are five hardcover books.

14:06.912 --> 14:12.821
And one of those, Little Follies, of course, is a collection of nine novellas.

14:13.221 --> 14:16.607
So it's been going on for a while.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.109
And you began this when?

14:18.129 --> 14:18.229
Yeah.

14:19.407 --> 14:21.930
We're covering stuff we covered before.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.752
Yes, that's okay.

14:24.513 --> 14:30.459
This depends on, like, not where do you stop, but where do you start.

14:32.101 --> 14:41.211
I really did get the idea one cold winter's day back in, so it would have been 1962 when I was a sophomore.

14:41.231 --> 14:42.772
Oh, wait, no.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.935
I started at Harvard in June of 61.

14:45.035 --> 14:45.735
Yeah.

14:45.755 --> 14:48.098
No, I was still a freshman then, so it would have been 63.

14:48.837 --> 14:53.402
the winter of 63, January or February of 63.

14:54.443 --> 15:04.735
And the first self-publication of the whole saga started in 1976.

15:05.015 --> 15:10.882
And then the first paperback novella was published in 1982.

15:12.604 --> 15:16.448
First hardcover book, which was Herb and Lorna, 1988.

15:17.052 --> 15:19.217
That was basically the breakthrough, would you say?

15:19.277 --> 15:25.392
Yes, to a larger audience and more conventional publishing.

15:25.412 --> 15:27.317
That got quite a bit of press, I think.

15:28.339 --> 15:33.873
Do you, by the way, have a nice fat press kit that I can get?

15:33.913 --> 15:34.875
Sure.

15:35.463 --> 15:57.235
um with you know and don't be stingy with the stories i mean i like as much i had this all once upon a time and since i moved out of the newspaper here to my own office at home you know a lot of things have been have been lost along the way i will need at least a half a dozen pictures of you by the way okay i just got the toledo blade this week oh great

15:57.468 --> 15:58.209
Can you believe it?

15:58.229 --> 15:59.891
200,000 circulation.

15:59.911 --> 16:00.691
Oh, wonderful.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.734
And they're taking me every week.

16:03.554 --> 16:04.115
Anyway, go ahead.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.236
I'm sorry.

16:05.256 --> 16:12.284
You know, if you don't mind pausing just for a minute, give me the list of papers.

16:12.924 --> 16:13.665
Okay, go ahead.

16:13.685 --> 16:15.267
Start that again, Eric.

16:16.128 --> 16:24.977
About a year from now, in the early spring of 1995, all of my books will come out in paperback in uniform editions.

16:25.615 --> 16:31.621
as the spring list of Picador, a new imprint of Macmillan.

16:31.841 --> 16:40.789
It's an imprint of Macmillan UK now, but they're going to launch it here in the fall of this year with a mixed fiction list.

16:40.930 --> 16:44.933
And then the spring list will be the complete works of craft.

16:44.953 --> 16:45.514
That's great.

16:46.575 --> 16:47.316
That's terrific.

16:48.477 --> 16:49.097
Isn't it?

16:49.117 --> 16:49.298
Yeah.

16:49.458 --> 16:54.002
Now, when you started this out of your home,

16:55.754 --> 17:11.115
You developed, you built this strong following, which, you know, to use that buzzword, the cult following, with the hope that you would break through to the wider audience, I guess.

17:11.435 --> 17:11.695
No.

17:12.536 --> 17:13.177
Not really?

17:14.279 --> 17:21.709
I have to say that, of course, I was looking for publications in some form.

17:22.189 --> 17:24.192
But, you know, I...

17:24.982 --> 17:33.451
I enjoyed the newsletter publication so much that I honestly stopped looking for something else.

17:34.152 --> 17:48.188
If financial difficulty hadn't made it impossible for me to continue publishing the newsletters at one point, I don't think I would have gone looking for a publisher other than myself.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.280
I was happy as my own publisher.

17:54.204 --> 17:57.369
I found myself easy to get along with.

17:57.429 --> 17:59.672
Were you able to live off it?

18:00.353 --> 18:01.715
No, not at all.

18:02.236 --> 18:08.505
In the eyes of the IRS, it was never anything more than a hobby.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.196
Tell me.

18:09.396 --> 18:11.921
My little thing is a business too, which is fun.

18:11.941 --> 18:13.925
I'm just finishing my text today.

18:13.985 --> 18:16.129
It's kind of comical in a way.

18:18.253 --> 18:19.114
Go ahead.

18:19.134 --> 18:28.131
So, you know, it's all for the best that it moved on into more conventional publishing.

18:28.685 --> 18:33.550
But it was a very interesting way to develop the work, and I certainly enjoyed it.

18:33.931 --> 18:36.073
Well, are you writing it differently now, in your view?

18:36.614 --> 18:38.035
Yes, I think so.

18:39.837 --> 18:45.403
In this sense, that the pieces are so much larger.

18:45.463 --> 18:54.473
I've always had the very strong awareness of form, that whatever...

18:54.824 --> 19:12.729
bit of the entire work I sent out at any one time, and I still think of myself as sending these books out to my readers, I have wanted it to be clearly a unified, complete chunk.

19:13.350 --> 19:19.498
Even though it's part of a much larger work, I really...

19:19.748 --> 19:22.251
want that closure for each one.

19:23.132 --> 19:35.048
And now that I'm working in long form, it's an opportunity to make each one much richer, of course.

19:35.088 --> 19:40.595
There's just so much more I can do in the space that I've given myself now.

19:41.777 --> 19:45.081
But it's also a...

19:46.327 --> 19:51.614
There's a delayed gratification factor or delayed communication factor.

19:51.694 --> 20:12.199
The fact that I send something to my readers so much less frequently than I used to is a little, well, it requires a different kind of discipline and a kind of self-confidence that

20:13.242 --> 20:17.147
I certainly didn't have back when I was sending out the newsletters.

20:17.167 --> 20:32.646
I don't think that I could have sustained the effort of writing and writing, rewriting, editing a whole thing for such a long period without that contact with the readers.

20:33.326 --> 20:35.189
Do you have a specific reader in mind?

20:35.249 --> 20:36.350
I mean, do you visualize?

20:36.991 --> 20:38.132
I'm sorry?

20:38.152 --> 20:38.493
Madeline.

20:38.513 --> 20:39.754
Madeline.

20:39.774 --> 20:40.555
Most definitely.

20:41.877 --> 20:42.017
Uh-huh.

20:42.267 --> 21:11.413
my my first reader uh and um in many senses my uh only reader you know i didn't i i i shouldn't say it that way no i just mean that uh the reader who counts right yeah but you see you see a you see a face when you're writing though is what i guess i'm saying too well you know i see a lot of them now i um

21:12.406 --> 21:18.997
Having met so many of my readers, I do have a sense of a sort of community of readers in my work.

21:19.899 --> 21:30.196
And I know from feedback the ways in which people get it, see the large design.

21:31.198 --> 21:38.110
People who have been with me for some time now, I think, really have a sense of what I'm building.

21:39.085 --> 21:45.897
and not just of the bricks that are going into it, you know?

21:46.198 --> 21:55.835
Do these readers, do they ever express dissatisfaction the way certain things go?

21:55.855 --> 22:00.003
I mean, maybe they aren't going the way they want them to go?

22:00.023 --> 22:03.068
Right, they do.

22:04.482 --> 22:08.027
The flip side of that is pleasure at the way things are going too.

22:08.648 --> 22:24.050
Two things have happened as the work has grown and as time has passed and as the readership has grown that the work has become so much larger and more diverse than it was.

22:24.370 --> 22:29.157
At least the evidence of its diversity is there now.

22:29.761 --> 22:49.551
And the readership at the same time has become so much larger and more diverse that there are people who, well, all readers, I suppose, have parts of the work that they are particularly fond of or that resonate for them in a particular way.

22:50.513 --> 22:51.955
And...

22:53.639 --> 22:59.807
We, as people, like to have more of what we like and less of what we don't like as much.

23:00.428 --> 23:21.435
And so as I follow the questions that are leading me into all the little nooks and crannies of this work, the what's happening in that house in Babington now, what's this character up to, what's going to become of so-and-so, and as I pursue all of those and for such a diverse readership,

23:21.989 --> 23:32.802
it is more and more often the case that people say, oh, I wish you'd give me more about Peter's childhood, or I want more about the grandparents, you know, instead of what you currently happen to be doing.

23:33.603 --> 23:47.581
So this is an interesting consequence for me of having a larger readership, that there are more people with their own ideas of what the work should become.

23:48.041 --> 23:49.363
You know, I just spent...

23:50.086 --> 24:08.595
time at Harvard and at the Governor Dummer Academy and talking with students and listening to their questions on two different age levels, but really not terribly different levels of perception and interest.

24:09.637 --> 24:16.127
The most frequent type of question is a question about

24:17.153 --> 24:18.936
What's going to become of so-and-so?

24:18.956 --> 24:21.420
Where will so-and-so go?

24:22.161 --> 24:40.351
And you just find that people either identify with the character or find that they're annoyed by a character in some cases and want, as a result, to know what's going to happen to that character.

24:40.411 --> 24:44.157
And they want the narrative to follow

24:44.609 --> 24:53.363
that character or have that character be dominant, at least in the next chunk of the overall work.

24:53.383 --> 24:55.306
And I can't do that for all of them.

24:55.326 --> 24:55.607
Sure.

24:56.949 --> 25:00.295
You have, I mean, this is a corpus for you, obviously.

25:00.335 --> 25:02.238
This is a full body of work.

25:03.560 --> 25:03.680
Right.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.523
And I guess it goes on as long as you go on.

25:05.763 --> 25:07.106
That's about, is that?

25:07.126 --> 25:08.047
Yes, it is.

25:08.187 --> 25:10.431
We will be coterminous.

25:11.963 --> 25:16.549
And, I mean, there's growth here with you, is that correct?

25:16.810 --> 25:17.991
I certainly hope so.

25:18.272 --> 25:21.576
I mean, in terms of the characters and developments.

25:22.057 --> 25:24.040
Yeah.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.903
Do you see these characters?

25:26.964 --> 25:31.370
I mean, this is a cliché question, but nevertheless, I mean, they're real for you, obviously.

25:31.410 --> 25:33.693
Yes, they certainly are.

25:34.073 --> 25:38.179
And you care as much about their welfare as the readers do, I'm sure.

25:38.199 --> 25:40.502
I do.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.662
You know, I try to be kind to them.

25:43.942 --> 25:48.707
I really, I would save all my characters if I could.

25:49.447 --> 25:59.476
But they have a habit of getting, well, some of them, not all of them, but many of them have a habit of getting themselves into bad situations.

26:00.678 --> 26:09.085
And just fate or accident puts them into bad situations.

26:09.586 --> 26:11.147
This is the case with Arianne.

26:11.549 --> 26:23.888
that Peter, having imagined this woman after all, would have imagined for her as well an ideal life of some kind.

26:24.950 --> 26:39.632
And because he is running around trying to move his little play characters throughout his entire world, it is unavoidable.

26:40.355 --> 26:44.762
that there should be occasions when things go badly.

26:46.144 --> 26:51.492
And it broke his heart when Ariane came to a bad end.

26:53.115 --> 26:57.943
So he had to go in there and try to fix things for her.

26:58.984 --> 27:04.573
And that's why he gives her this gift of a second chance at life, at least in his books.

27:04.874 --> 27:09.940
When you're writing these, what do you want people to take out of the books?

27:10.000 --> 27:13.204
I mean, is it entertainment fundamentally?

27:16.307 --> 27:31.084
I think it's... Now, I have to explore this question with you a little, Nick, because as I've thought about the real answer to this question, you know, I think you're the first person to ask me this.

27:31.688 --> 27:56.683
But I've thought about that because when I first started writing, when I first started attempting to write, one of the struggles I had was that I couldn't imagine why I was being so arrogant as to think that I had something worth saying to myself.

27:57.524 --> 28:06.718
a lot of people I didn't know yet, or to people I did, friends who might read, that was worth their taking the time to read it.

28:07.860 --> 28:24.004
And, you know, I worked in silence, you know, without showing things to anyone for a decade, because I had to find

28:24.727 --> 28:37.004
what it was that I had to say and to bring it to a point where I could say, yes, this is worth saying, first of all, and it is worth the reading, second.

28:37.525 --> 28:51.004
It still sounds arrogant to me to say that, but I have discovered that there is a way in which I can say, well, here is something about my books that I'm not...

28:51.929 --> 28:54.031
that I'm not embarrassed to claim for them.

28:54.351 --> 28:55.212
And here's what it is.

28:55.993 --> 29:11.787
That I think that I provide a fine place to think and imagine along with me.

29:14.610 --> 29:21.396
I really think that the reader and I are in this together and that I've made this

29:21.730 --> 29:50.910
place this Babington I've let it mirror reality in some ways and I've let it suggest an alternative reality in other ways and I think that they are provocative ways I think they are ways that like a move on a chess board although I don't quite like that game analogy because it sounds as if the reader and I are in competition more as if we were say bridge partners

29:51.683 --> 29:58.231
playing against somebody else, that we work together.

29:59.512 --> 30:11.546
Peter says in several places that one of the things he's always liked about the books that he likes is that they have room in them for his mind to wander.

30:12.227 --> 30:20.897
And I think I have provided that room and furnished it well with interesting collectibles and

30:21.198 --> 30:50.192
pieces of junk and anything that might provoke the imagination the readers memory readers response so that I think my books are very active reads and the reader that I like and the reader who likes my work I think is somebody with a good mind a good imagination

30:50.746 --> 30:57.445
who is happy to participate in this.

30:57.465 --> 30:57.887
Great.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.766
I'm glad I asked the question.

30:59.986 --> 31:00.266
Yeah.

31:01.548 --> 31:02.369
That's a great quote.

31:02.850 --> 31:04.252
I'm going to knock it off now.

31:04.472 --> 31:05.053
Okay.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.937
Because I've got a tape here and I want to transcribe it and assess it.

31:08.237 --> 31:13.043
Now, big thing, can you arrange to get me a kit sent from Hillary or whatever?

31:13.103 --> 31:14.425
Yeah, I'll fax her immediately.

31:14.665 --> 31:15.927
And, you know, tell her.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.090
Six pictures.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.434
Yeah, but I really want as much press stuff going back even.

31:22.095 --> 31:24.498
Oh, so like copies of reviews?

31:24.719 --> 31:25.039
Sure.
