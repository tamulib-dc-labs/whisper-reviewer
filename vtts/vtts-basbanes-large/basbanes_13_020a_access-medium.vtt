WEBVTT

00:03.794 --> 00:10.002
Yeah, that way I don't have to take notes and I can just... And then you might want to look at some of them.

00:11.584 --> 00:12.726
Oh, I'd love to.

00:12.746 --> 00:20.696
And I'm just going to leave the table shopping for Christmas presents.

00:20.716 --> 00:25.963
Up to that point, there weren't very many Christmas presents.

00:25.983 --> 00:33.092
And if people were giving people Christmas presents, it was more likely to be a side of bacon or some molasses for cooking.

00:33.359 --> 00:42.708
And so this got people into the habit of shopping for Christmas, got men into the habit anyway.

00:42.728 --> 00:43.669
So interesting.

00:43.909 --> 00:48.553
And it got women to want and expect presents.

00:49.995 --> 00:51.817
Like that one.

00:52.878 --> 00:59.704
Just as the night before Christmas got children to expect and want their presents.

01:00.443 --> 01:08.514
And incidentally, the first gift book was 1823, and that I had before Christmas, which was published in 1823.

01:08.674 --> 01:09.776
Really?

01:09.816 --> 01:22.152
Well, then I'll do a little boasting.

01:24.295 --> 01:26.878
These are the first Christmas cards.

01:27.359 --> 01:28.020
Okay.

01:28.253 --> 01:30.735
Which are fabulous out there in the catalog.

01:30.996 --> 01:34.179
Well, since the catalog, I've got... Since the catalog.

01:36.221 --> 01:44.349
Now, I think I am modestly, I'm virtually certain.

01:44.369 --> 01:52.517
This is the most extensive collection in the world, the first Christmas card.

01:52.537 --> 01:54.919
Really?

01:55.355 --> 02:21.279
I think this is the card that's in the catalog.

02:22.961 --> 02:24.602
That's the card that's in the catalog.

02:25.595 --> 02:33.846
Oh, that's wonderful.

02:33.866 --> 02:35.488
And that's in very nice condition.

02:35.528 --> 02:38.332
Yeah, that was the one we looked at in that catalog.

02:38.352 --> 02:38.652
It's beautiful.

02:38.672 --> 02:44.740
Just briefly, what was the FDR book that had the ownership signature, without getting up again?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.883
Oh, that was the gift of the book.

02:46.923 --> 02:54.353
They were 1842 and 43, and one of them is Eleonora.

02:55.548 --> 03:13.106
by Poe, and the other is, uh, is the, uh, uh, the, uh, the famous one, the, uh, Pit in the Pendulum.

03:14.767 --> 03:20.894
Now, since, since then, this was, this was the one that's in the catalog.

03:20.914 --> 03:22.315
Since then, I got this one.

03:23.493 --> 03:25.275
And this is signed by J.C.

03:25.355 --> 03:25.936
Horsley.

03:27.538 --> 03:34.846
And he was the designer, he was the artist who approved the first Christmas card.

03:36.408 --> 03:39.512
And I got this from Justin.

03:41.454 --> 03:49.804
And this is of particular interest because there was always considerable

03:50.560 --> 03:55.586
I doubt as to when the first Christmas card actually was created.

03:57.548 --> 04:06.720
For many, many years up until the 1950s, it was thought that probably the first Christmas card was 1846.

04:08.281 --> 04:17.833
And the reason was that in his memoirs, Henry Cole, who was the guy who commissioned the first card,

04:18.995 --> 04:22.680
He referred to 1846 as being the date.

04:23.962 --> 04:29.630
But he wrote those memoirs 30 or 40 years later, and his memory was at 4.

04:29.991 --> 04:33.977
He didn't write them 40 years later because he was dead 40 years later.

04:33.997 --> 04:34.578
30 years later.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.662
And his memory was at 4.

04:38.323 --> 04:46.555
And three cards came in a view, were found, turned up.

04:47.598 --> 04:54.087
of which this is one, that were dated, and this one is dated 1843.

04:54.207 --> 05:02.078
Now, does the person who presented it be signed in the manner that we do today, or have they been signed by the person who presents it?

05:02.198 --> 05:15.196
Well, you see at the top it says, to, and then the person who sends the card writes out who it's to, and there's a from down here, and this was from J.C.

05:15.216 --> 05:17.419
Horsley.

05:18.850 --> 05:22.694
Christmas, 1843.

05:22.835 --> 05:27.560
So that established that 1843 was the date.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.904
And were these sent by post, do you think?

05:31.144 --> 05:33.206
Yeah, they were sent by post.

05:33.987 --> 05:47.963
In fact, preceding them, there was something called...

05:48.280 --> 05:56.429
A Christmas envelope.

05:56.449 --> 06:06.300
I'm not sure where it is.

06:06.320 --> 06:16.431
Well, what these are, this is a proof, printer's proof, of the first car.

06:17.390 --> 06:26.722
There are only 21 or possibly 22 of the Christmas cards, of the first cards in existence today.

06:28.424 --> 06:32.970
And there are about four or five proofs in existence.

06:32.990 --> 06:38.557
And the first card, Betsy Shirley has one.

06:39.218 --> 06:43.363
And the Morgan Library has one.

06:44.423 --> 06:48.730
And the New York Historical Society has one.

06:50.212 --> 06:52.736
And the Victoria and Albert Museum has one.

06:54.538 --> 06:56.241
The British Museum has one.

06:57.242 --> 07:01.088
Anyway, it's known where they all are.

07:01.108 --> 07:10.903
There was a fellow in Canada who made a census of them.

07:12.520 --> 07:17.566
Of the 21 now, I've got three of them.

07:17.586 --> 07:19.408
You had three of them?

07:19.428 --> 07:20.990
Oh my goodness.

07:21.410 --> 07:23.653
Anyway, this is a proof of the first card.

07:24.614 --> 07:37.148
And this is given, this was given as a souvenir by Henry Cole in 1865 to Lady Dorothy Neville.

07:37.188 --> 07:38.470
She had signed in pencil.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.413
And over here,

07:42.743 --> 07:53.757
This is... In 1865, Henry Cole had not yet been knighted.

07:56.401 --> 08:00.326
But over here, this is a facsimile of the first card.

08:01.488 --> 08:02.709
And this was printed in 1881.

08:05.433 --> 08:12.582
And because by that time, Christmas cards were so popular that...

08:12.916 --> 08:23.409
For nostalgia's sake, they reprinted the first card, but you can see how they, and by this, the first card was hand-colored.

08:24.230 --> 08:27.014
These are, these are, these are not hand-colored.

08:33.342 --> 08:34.944
That's magnificent.

08:34.984 --> 08:40.251
That's incredible.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.893
That's after 1840.

08:42.785 --> 08:45.669
There's a difference between collecting and acquiring.

08:46.610 --> 08:56.124
Well, collecting implies involves a focus, and I think it's the most focused collection back I've ever seen.

08:57.826 --> 09:12.066
I was mentioning the first—well, here's an even better—

09:12.451 --> 09:14.274
This is another proof.

09:15.916 --> 09:17.278
That's beautiful.

09:17.298 --> 09:20.562
That's a better condition, proof.

09:20.582 --> 09:22.585
So this is all hand colored over here?

09:22.605 --> 09:22.926
Is that right?

09:22.946 --> 09:23.707
That's hand colored.

09:24.368 --> 09:25.749
And that's the third color.

09:25.890 --> 09:31.217
So this would have been printed like this, and then an artist would have painted in the details, right?

09:31.237 --> 09:35.824
That's right.

09:35.844 --> 09:37.185
And isn't it a fox or anything?

09:37.205 --> 09:38.547
What kind of condition was the paper?

09:39.689 --> 09:41.952
You can see the strokes when I painted it.

09:42.387 --> 09:44.689
that you can tell the difference between that one and the other one.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.209
Yeah, you can.

09:45.970 --> 09:47.211
It looks like a little larger.

09:47.231 --> 09:49.413
Are they the same size?

09:49.433 --> 09:50.554
Is that the same size?

09:50.574 --> 09:52.155
Does that look a little bit larger?

09:52.175 --> 09:53.116
Yeah, it's the same size.

09:53.136 --> 09:55.798
It's all in the same block, I know.

09:55.818 --> 09:56.139
Beautiful.

09:56.819 --> 09:59.201
That's extraordinary that exists, isn't it?

09:59.221 --> 10:00.142
The first Christmas card.

10:00.823 --> 10:02.504
In such beautiful conditions.

10:02.604 --> 10:05.026
Well, these things have been produced since then, that's the first.

10:05.046 --> 10:07.088
As fresh as it was produced, it's beautiful.

10:07.108 --> 10:10.111
About two and a quarter billion are printed every year in the United States.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.652
About three million every year, that's the first.

10:12.222 --> 10:17.048
This is, I mentioned, a Christmas envelope.

10:17.068 --> 10:19.531
That's a Christmas envelope.

10:19.551 --> 10:21.494
It was all printed like that?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.336
This was printed in 1840.

10:23.376 --> 10:25.319
Where would you address it, right there?

10:25.339 --> 10:25.759
Right there.

10:26.901 --> 10:27.622
And that's 1840.

10:27.802 --> 10:30.205
That was three years before the first crystal card.

10:30.225 --> 10:34.551
It was printed by the same man who printed the first card.

10:34.571 --> 10:38.095
And it looks like a personal message in there from someone.

10:43.525 --> 10:56.561
Well, this is a letter.

11:00.987 --> 11:02.028
You love this, don't you?

11:03.210 --> 11:03.750
I can tell.

11:07.475 --> 11:13.262
I can tell in the preface that you wrote to the catalog that you were really looking for a collectible that made you feel good.

11:13.495 --> 11:16.419
I think.

11:16.439 --> 11:23.069
And I can see here, as you're sharing this with us, how special it is too.

11:23.089 --> 11:24.591
Who doesn't like Christmas?

11:24.611 --> 11:25.813
Yeah.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.315
But the gift books are interesting.

11:27.335 --> 11:32.243
I just didn't know how that originated, and how it influenced gift exchange.

11:32.263 --> 11:35.207
I never wonder about the same one.

11:35.227 --> 11:40.735
No, you've seen all three of the first course, and you've seen two proofs.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.947
And this is just another facsimile.

11:48.632 --> 12:07.836
This is this facsimile, by this time, this was in 1881, and Henry Cole died in 1882, so this is the first, this is the last card, the last Christmas card he ever sent from Sir Henry Cole to Mr. and Mrs. G. Wallace.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.131
And Wallace was the first head of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

12:12.231 --> 12:16.115
Can you describe what the content—what is the picture showing us?

12:16.135 --> 12:24.664
Yeah, well, it's a family toasting the recipient with glasses of wine.

12:24.684 --> 12:35.916
And in the 1840s, when this was first done, it was criticized

12:36.875 --> 12:39.337
on the basis that it would encourage drunkenness.

12:39.938 --> 12:40.338
Oh, boy.

12:42.080 --> 12:58.575
And on the left-hand side is a panel representing Christmas charity, which is feeding the poor, and the right-hand side is clothing the poor.

12:58.935 --> 13:00.937
Which are Christmas virtues, to be sure.

13:03.339 --> 13:03.720
Yeah.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.122
So that's rather unusual.

13:06.794 --> 13:13.983
I mean, I know there is nothing like that anyways.

13:14.003 --> 13:31.587
When you started collecting, did you say, well, it's going to be a book collection, it's going to be an ephemera collection, it's going to be an art collection, or was it going to be a collection with the theme of Christmas and... No, when I started collecting, I started just getting books.

13:31.987 --> 13:32.788
Fun books.

13:33.329 --> 13:34.611
Fun books.

13:34.631 --> 13:35.772
They tended to be...

13:36.173 --> 13:56.424
I'll show you one of the early ones.

13:56.444 --> 13:56.945
It's an interesting book.

13:56.965 --> 13:58.007
In fact, you can pull this right out.

13:58.027 --> 14:00.170
Oh, we've got to look at this out here.

14:00.190 --> 14:02.814
Oh, my God.

14:02.834 --> 14:03.475
There's more books.

14:03.495 --> 14:04.797
There you go.

14:06.532 --> 14:08.735
So which way did the sun rise from, by the way?

14:08.955 --> 14:10.177
The sun rises over there.

14:10.478 --> 14:11.139
That's the east.

14:11.319 --> 14:14.163
OK.

14:14.203 --> 14:14.924
What a tree.

14:15.284 --> 14:15.465
Wow.

14:26.560 --> 14:31.948
This is a bunch of very well-known writers.

14:37.582 --> 14:46.332
started publishing.

14:48.454 --> 14:52.339
You said this is one of the first things you acquired, right?

14:52.359 --> 14:53.139
Yeah.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.824
This is the owl, and there's the winter owl.

14:58.465 --> 15:02.610
And these are all the people who were involved in it.

15:13.205 --> 15:14.487
I can't hear their signatures.

15:17.010 --> 15:26.461
William H. Davis, William Harding Davis, no.

15:27.062 --> 15:29.205
Sassoon, Mike Sirbaugh.

15:30.606 --> 15:30.927
Sure.

15:31.487 --> 15:33.990
John Masefield.

15:34.010 --> 15:34.791
Galsworthy.

15:35.252 --> 15:36.494
I see Galsworthy.

15:37.355 --> 15:39.017
William Harding Davis, perhaps?

15:39.918 --> 15:42.621
Robbitts.

15:44.879 --> 15:46.161
That's pretty nice.

15:47.703 --> 15:49.325
That's the kind of thing I was collecting.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.349
But I was just doing hit or miss.

15:52.429 --> 15:58.037
You can't just collect books.

15:58.077 --> 15:59.559
You say just doing hit or miss.

15:59.579 --> 16:01.542
Do you mean, was there a focus?

16:02.203 --> 16:13.058
Well, actually, I was collecting, I tended to collect a lot of children's books.

16:13.078 --> 16:14.700
Mother Goose and that kind of stuff.

16:17.245 --> 16:21.531
But you can't just collect, well you can just collect children.

16:21.551 --> 16:26.158
But I was higgledy-piggledy, I was all over the place.

16:28.441 --> 16:33.949
Incidentally, Ellie has a collection of books.

16:34.349 --> 16:37.334
These are all on women.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.999
I like that collection.

16:42.381 --> 16:44.704
Wonderful.

16:46.456 --> 16:47.857
that most of us saw.

16:47.977 --> 16:54.303
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, of course, is very important.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.924
That's a beautiful collection.

16:55.944 --> 16:58.827
The Life and Life of Susan Anthony.

16:58.847 --> 17:03.211
Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.612
The Scarlet Letter.

17:07.134 --> 17:09.816
Why do I ask a digression?

17:09.836 --> 17:11.218
Well, digressions are good.

17:11.238 --> 17:15.501
Husbands and wives, they collect ones.

17:15.521 --> 17:16.142
Good night.

17:16.190 --> 17:19.015
decided, well, I've got to concentrate on something.

17:19.055 --> 17:20.658
What shall I concentrate on?

17:21.860 --> 17:24.685
And I asked myself, what do I like most in all the world?

17:26.188 --> 17:31.737
And I decided that Christmas was what I like most in all the world.

17:31.757 --> 17:35.384
They're a little childish, but there you are.

17:35.404 --> 17:37.708
I think it's fabulous, fabulous.

17:37.728 --> 17:38.890
I'll use that here, yes.

17:45.316 --> 17:58.271
Well then, by this time, now we're getting up around late 40s and 50s, by this time the fad was, the gift book fad was dying out.

17:59.893 --> 18:11.487
And so then, as a result of Dickens' Christmas books, everybody started writing books for Christmas.

18:13.089 --> 18:13.990
And this was a new

18:14.122 --> 18:19.247
They were written for Christmas, and they were called holiday books.

18:21.129 --> 18:26.575
And at that point, maybe it would be good to drop down to Dickens.

18:35.064 --> 18:43.352
These are, well of course, virtually every book in here, the first edition.

18:46.690 --> 19:01.466
The first set of the five Dickens Christmas books, I just happened to run across about a month ago.

19:02.167 --> 19:09.014
I ran across the invoice for these five books.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.242
They were six pounds.

19:16.913 --> 19:19.996
It cost you six pounds?

19:20.016 --> 19:21.678
Yes, that's what they cost, six pounds.

19:21.698 --> 19:22.218
Originally.

19:22.739 --> 19:23.399
In 1952.

19:23.419 --> 19:26.542
That was originally what he paid.

19:26.783 --> 19:31.827
And today they would be, well, give or take, ten thousand pounds.

19:33.069 --> 19:34.630
You paid six pounds for those.

19:34.890 --> 19:39.135
Well, that's pretty sagacious, isn't it?

19:39.155 --> 19:42.838
I mean, I don't know how people can afford to collect things nowadays.

19:43.339 --> 19:44.760
Books, they're so expensive.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.173
If you're going to be a high-spot collector, it's very expensive.

19:53.858 --> 19:57.782
The Christmas Carol is a very interesting book.

19:57.802 --> 19:59.603
You have multiple copies.

19:59.623 --> 20:00.664
Maybe you can explain that.

20:00.905 --> 20:01.405
Oh, I will.

20:01.806 --> 20:04.508
Don't worry.

20:05.729 --> 20:14.097
The question is, what is the real first edition, the first issue, first edition?

20:14.117 --> 20:14.798
Is it in parts?

20:15.858 --> 20:24.610
Yes, well, it came out, it's in sections, but it was published all once.

20:24.850 --> 20:25.151
It was.

20:25.411 --> 20:26.012
Oh, yeah.

20:26.032 --> 20:26.593
I know that.

20:27.153 --> 20:27.414
Oh, yeah.

20:28.575 --> 20:45.038
And conventional wisdom holds today that the Green End Papers in

20:45.254 --> 21:01.834
and the red and blue title page, and stave Roman numeral one rather than O-N-E, and uncorrected text, and so on.

21:01.854 --> 21:06.720
But that is the first issue of the first edition.

21:06.740 --> 21:15.210
And if that is so, then this is a superb

21:15.933 --> 21:19.797
a copy of that book.

21:22.620 --> 21:25.663
Now this is the Green End Papers.

21:26.384 --> 21:27.605
We have a book plate here, too.

21:28.586 --> 21:32.751
There's Stave Eyes.

21:32.791 --> 21:41.400
And here is Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig, drawn by John Leach.

21:42.528 --> 21:45.873
There are four plates in here, four color plates.

21:45.893 --> 21:47.355
That's wonderful.

21:47.375 --> 21:55.847
And so that would be considered today the first, the first.

21:58.570 --> 22:01.114
The first appearance, yeah.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.939
I really got started off on a long foot here.

22:04.979 --> 22:06.542
I should have given you a bit of background.

22:07.904 --> 22:11.809
Dickens wanted this book to be perfect.

22:12.515 --> 22:19.606
And he had a separate, I can't remember what's in the catalog and what's not in the catalog.

22:19.626 --> 22:30.764
But he had a new style of, a new deal that he settled off with his publisher.

22:32.707 --> 22:40.699
And the deal was that he would

22:41.557 --> 23:01.996
He would pay all the expenses of having it done, but he would get all the profits, and the Chapman and Hall publishers would get a fixed commission on the number of copies sold.

23:04.058 --> 23:09.623
Well, the result of that was a disaster, which we'll predict as we'll come to a little bit later.

23:10.615 --> 23:25.212
But in trying to come out with a perfect book that he could still sell for very inexpensively, for five shillings, he experimented all over the place.

23:25.792 --> 23:27.494
Dickens did personally, right?

23:27.514 --> 23:27.635
Yeah.

23:28.696 --> 23:38.547
And the first thing he wanted to do, he wanted to have green endpapers, and he wanted to have

23:40.163 --> 23:46.070
a green and red title page.

23:48.513 --> 23:49.394
And I'll show you that.

23:49.754 --> 23:51.796
Boy, how can you do that inexpensively?

23:52.057 --> 23:58.364
And we also want to have four pictures in hand-colored.

23:59.285 --> 24:02.028
This was before color printing came off.

24:03.850 --> 24:09.597
And since he started writing this the first week in October,

24:11.028 --> 24:13.971
And the first books were delivered to him on December 17.

24:18.675 --> 24:21.438
And the first printing consisted of 6,000 copies.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.582
So there were four plates that had to be hand-colored.

24:26.602 --> 24:29.205
That meant hand-coloring 24,000 plates.

24:29.905 --> 24:36.792
Well, you can see a problem that posed.

24:36.812 --> 24:40.495
Well, this is what is commonly known

24:41.842 --> 24:48.649
as the trial issue.

24:48.669 --> 24:54.014
And here's the yellow—I mean, green endpapers.

24:59.200 --> 25:06.407
And if you look closely, you'll see that this—see, this is— That's red and green.

25:06.427 --> 25:11.292
You said I had to go through the press twice.

25:12.773 --> 25:17.340
The green tended to rub off.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.802
You see the way it's rubbing off?

25:18.862 --> 25:19.383
Yes, I do.

25:19.403 --> 25:20.144
I see it looks warm.

25:20.785 --> 25:25.131
And the green of the type was a little too drab.

25:26.954 --> 25:29.798
So he decided not to do it in red and green.

25:30.620 --> 25:32.482
So this is very rare then.

25:32.502 --> 25:34.846
This is quite rare.

25:34.866 --> 25:42.257
And so he decided not to do it with the green endpapers, but with the yellow endpapers.

25:43.908 --> 25:47.192
That was a trial one.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.657
How many of those were produced, Jacques, did you say was the trial?

25:50.677 --> 25:51.578
Well, nobody really knows.

25:51.618 --> 25:55.062
I'll explain it to you in a second.

25:55.082 --> 26:00.389
Among the experiments he tried, he tried pink endpapers.

26:00.549 --> 26:01.891
That's incredible.

26:01.991 --> 26:03.193
I had no idea.

26:03.974 --> 26:08.059
The pink endpapers are very rare.

26:16.240 --> 26:23.688
I think the green and the red are traditionally Christmas colors.

26:23.808 --> 26:30.836
He picked the green and red because they were nice Christmassy colors.

26:30.856 --> 26:35.881
I don't know how involved he was in the... This is a paratextual statement.

26:36.542 --> 26:37.723
Involved in the production.

26:37.763 --> 26:42.569
I didn't realize that Dickens is currently saying that he took such a direct hand in the production.

26:42.589 --> 26:43.850
Oh, he did.

26:45.292 --> 26:45.572
He did.

26:45.839 --> 26:51.407
On page 17, you see that signature C down at the bottom?

26:55.773 --> 26:56.474
Oh, yes, right there.

26:57.255 --> 26:57.355
Yeah.

26:57.375 --> 26:57.815
Oh, yes, I do.

26:57.835 --> 27:07.789
See, that's a perfect C. Now, as the print run ran along, the C became broken.

27:09.071 --> 27:09.592
And the type.

27:10.152 --> 27:13.036
And the type is broken C. So that's a very early one.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.019
So this is an early one.

27:15.455 --> 27:21.264
But we know that's early anyway, because that's pink endpapers, which he didn't use.

27:21.284 --> 27:22.686
I'm going to have to read up on this.

27:22.706 --> 27:24.008
This is a fabulous story.

27:27.373 --> 27:32.701
Did Dickens take this kind of care with all of his books, or was it The Christmas Carol, you think, in particular?

27:32.721 --> 27:43.538
Oh, it was The Christmas Carol in particular, because he learned his lesson, because none of the other Christmas books have any color plates in them.

27:43.957 --> 27:44.798
Okay.

27:44.818 --> 27:45.720
So they never get it again.

27:45.740 --> 27:48.744
Is it too expensive or too— And what year was this when I asked?

27:48.804 --> 27:49.645
1843.

27:50.767 --> 27:53.190
Well, he's still a pretty young man then, isn't he, really?

27:55.814 --> 27:57.817
Probably in his thirties.

27:57.837 --> 27:58.458
1831.

28:01.282 --> 28:06.589
Now this—this is unique.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.672
That's the word every collector likes to hear.

28:09.153 --> 28:09.614
Look at that.

28:09.634 --> 28:11.837
Unique.

28:12.847 --> 28:17.874
particularly if they use the word correctly.

28:17.894 --> 28:18.956
That'd be signed, right?

28:19.136 --> 28:21.439
It's got the green.

28:21.459 --> 28:23.001
Probably no red.

28:23.021 --> 28:24.143
No red in the title page.

28:24.163 --> 28:24.644
Is it green?

28:24.664 --> 28:25.946
It looks blue.

28:25.966 --> 28:26.687
It's blue.

28:26.707 --> 28:27.408
Is it blue?

28:28.870 --> 28:33.336
The title has been left out.

28:33.356 --> 28:40.947
Dickens' title, Dickens' name, A Christmas Carol is Left Out by Charles Dickens.

28:41.163 --> 28:41.704
Sure.

28:41.724 --> 28:46.990
London has all been left out, because it missed the second pass to the press.

28:47.010 --> 28:51.015
So that, as far as we know, that's unique.

28:51.035 --> 28:51.997
That just slipped through.

28:52.017 --> 28:56.002
We could like it very early in the run, too.

28:56.022 --> 28:58.685
Well, let's... How's the C on the page 17?

28:58.785 --> 28:59.386
I forgot.

28:59.406 --> 29:05.874
Let's have a look at the C. I'm paying attention to that.

29:05.894 --> 29:08.858
It's collation, that's the first thing we need to see, too.

29:09.040 --> 29:09.560
That's great.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.722
It's nice and clean.

29:10.742 --> 29:12.023
It's very clean.

29:12.043 --> 29:12.784
You can see the type.

29:13.424 --> 29:13.684
What a book!

29:13.704 --> 29:15.666
It's even cleaner than the other seat.

29:15.746 --> 29:18.549
That's very early to the press.

29:18.789 --> 29:21.412
You can see the type coming through the pages.

29:21.432 --> 29:22.673
They're so clean.

29:23.093 --> 29:25.075
That's fabulous.

29:25.756 --> 29:27.277
That's really unbelievable.

29:27.758 --> 29:30.140
That's been shown at the Morgan Library.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.884
That was beautiful.

29:33.904 --> 29:34.865
Do you want to read that?

29:34.885 --> 29:35.706
It is a blue color.

29:35.726 --> 29:36.246
You were right.

29:38.015 --> 29:47.508
And so this is the Morgan Library description.

29:47.548 --> 29:49.812
Isn't that wonderful?

29:49.912 --> 29:51.234
Or a foul sheet, as it says.

29:51.294 --> 29:53.837
That could also be what they call foul sheets.

29:54.338 --> 30:04.592
They were printed, and they weren't supposed to go into the bound books, but they do.

30:04.692 --> 30:07.296
Yep, that's fine.

30:16.388 --> 30:17.810
These are a couple of Dickens letters.

30:17.930 --> 30:20.954
Oh, is it one of them?

30:20.974 --> 30:28.285
Pretty interesting.

30:28.305 --> 30:32.991
So the first Christmas card and the carol was printed in the same year, 1843?

30:33.011 --> 30:35.635
Yeah, Connie raises an interesting question, Jack.

30:35.835 --> 30:41.603
The first Christmas card is 1843, and also Christmas Carol is 1843 in the same year.

30:43.574 --> 30:49.982
So there seems to have been a very cultural interest in Christmas that goes beyond.

30:50.002 --> 30:51.724
I mean, something must have been happening there.

30:53.566 --> 31:11.607
This is a letter from him on the 24th of October, in which he says, uh, pray to me a favor of telling the committee of literary and scientific institutions that I am much satisfied by their kind remembrance,

31:12.295 --> 31:19.723
And that it is not a little matter which should prevent me from accepting their invitation for the 24th.

31:21.164 --> 31:24.668
I regret to add, however, that urgent engagement is required.

31:25.849 --> 31:30.374
The not little matter was he was riding the Christmas cow.

31:30.494 --> 31:36.140
He didn't have the time.

31:36.160 --> 31:40.024
And I recognize his handwritten food.

31:41.590 --> 31:44.414
It's got very legibles.

31:44.434 --> 31:48.959
That's wonderful.

31:48.979 --> 31:53.465
So your collecting of Dickens basically is restricted to the Christmas titles, is that right?

31:53.765 --> 31:57.109
Yeah.

31:59.212 --> 32:01.655
Now... I've been waiting for these.

32:02.957 --> 32:08.884
Oh, well, this is the... No, I'm not.

32:09.825 --> 32:11.327
I love this...

32:12.792 --> 32:21.081
Now this is recognizably the second issue.

32:22.243 --> 32:25.286
You see, this is stave one.

32:25.306 --> 32:26.588
They changed the one.

32:26.608 --> 32:30.132
As opposed to stave I. Oh, sure.

32:30.152 --> 32:30.993
It's still 1843.

32:31.013 --> 32:33.375
It's still hand-coloring the plates?

32:33.415 --> 32:33.916
Oh, yeah.

32:34.056 --> 32:34.697
Wow.

32:34.897 --> 32:38.361
This is still the original 6,000 copies.

32:38.797 --> 32:43.142
He kept the same cloth, didn't he, though, the brown cloth with the gold stamp?

32:43.342 --> 32:46.225
Only for the Christmas Carol.

32:46.285 --> 32:52.071
All the other Christmas books are different.

32:52.091 --> 32:54.154
Now I think we're going to see something special.

32:55.755 --> 32:59.760
I think those are pretty extraordinary.

32:59.780 --> 33:02.362
I want to show you.

33:02.382 --> 33:04.265
Now these are the other Christmas books as well, right?

33:07.308 --> 33:07.408
Yeah.

33:07.428 --> 33:08.449
Those are stupid.

33:09.880 --> 33:17.411
Now, here's the yellow endpapers.

33:17.431 --> 33:23.219
But here you'll see a broken sea.

33:23.259 --> 33:25.382
The sea is broken.

33:25.762 --> 33:29.848
Now, here's the question.

33:35.176 --> 33:38.200
The first ten copies

33:40.019 --> 33:47.487
of A Christmas Carol were delivered to Dickens on December 17th.

33:49.770 --> 34:01.964
He immediately inscribed all ten copies to friends and dated them December 17th.

34:05.768 --> 34:06.769
I've seen seven of

34:09.668 --> 34:37.093
They all have yellow endpapers, and they all have a perfect C. And I think if you were to ask Dickens what the first issue, first edition, the truth first was,

34:38.525 --> 34:41.349
He would point to those ten copies and say, well, these, of course.

34:41.870 --> 34:42.431
I think so.

34:43.272 --> 34:43.672
Makes sense.

34:44.293 --> 34:47.097
And I have been trying.

34:47.959 --> 34:51.864
I've got nine copies of the first edition.

34:51.884 --> 35:01.418
But I've been trying to get copies with the yellow endpapers with the perfect C, and I can't find one.

35:01.438 --> 35:03.701
You haven't found one.

35:05.204 --> 35:08.228
And I don't think it would be terribly expensive, because these days,

35:08.967 --> 35:12.852
Everybody says the Green End Papers.

35:13.333 --> 35:17.998
Is there anything inscribed by Dickens prior to December the 17th, or is that the earliest?

35:18.018 --> 35:18.259
No.

35:18.499 --> 35:20.902
Those are the ones for a presentation.

35:21.283 --> 35:27.510
Incidentally, just a little side.

35:27.991 --> 35:30.234
Kind of fun.

35:30.254 --> 35:37.523
This is the Encyclopedia of Britannia.

35:38.752 --> 35:47.124
Look at the print.

35:47.605 --> 35:55.335
Look at the nice paper they used.

35:55.976 --> 35:59.602
You don't see any yellowing at all crying because it's real paper.

35:59.782 --> 36:00.863
There's no pulp.

36:00.883 --> 36:01.384
It's on pulp.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.844
1843, November 25th.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.285
So that must be an announcement in there?

36:12.866 --> 36:13.246
I'll bet.

36:24.759 --> 36:26.821
That's quite excellent condition of that.

36:26.981 --> 36:30.685
It's fabulous.

36:31.806 --> 36:33.548
Do you want to look your eyes better than mine?

36:52.681 --> 37:18.131
I'm sure it's... I'm sure it's here now.

37:18.232 --> 37:18.632
I'm sure.

37:19.653 --> 37:21.996
The whole point of this is it's so hard to find.

37:22.229 --> 37:44.740
It's such a modest announcement of one of the most famous books of all time.

37:46.382 --> 37:50.768
And it's in the Britannia, November 25th, 1843.

37:51.929 --> 38:14.899
on page 751 751 jock they remember a fifth one down from the top one two three four five and it says new christmas book by mr dickens in december will be published in small 8vo with four colored with four colored in december will be published i'm missing it etchings and woodcuts by leach

38:15.520 --> 38:24.194
A Christmas Carol in Prose being A Ghost Story of Christmas by Charles Dickens, priced five shillings, Chapman and all, 186 grand.

38:25.856 --> 38:33.989
Now this, you compare that with the hype that goes around a bestseller or a non-bestseller today.

38:34.129 --> 38:37.214
It is a point where it's amazing, isn't it?

38:37.455 --> 38:38.016
Inside.

38:38.596 --> 38:39.578
It's inside, too.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.384
Oh, that's wonderful.

38:43.685 --> 38:48.213
Christian, you have to remember, I believe in Santa Claus.

38:49.555 --> 38:50.056
Here, hold this.

38:50.076 --> 38:50.937
I want to write that down.

38:53.201 --> 38:57.308
And you have a piece of cardboard in there, too.

38:57.328 --> 39:04.039
Jonathan, we know you have to go out tonight, so I want to just be alert, so I'm good to be imposing on your hospitality.

39:04.059 --> 39:05.822
Oh, well, we're fine now.

39:05.842 --> 39:06.283
No, you won't.

39:21.637 --> 39:23.599
It is fabulous, isn't it, Clive?

39:23.619 --> 39:24.500
It's wonderful.

39:24.520 --> 39:24.861
And who is it?

39:24.881 --> 39:26.042
How could it survive so wide?

39:26.062 --> 39:27.824
Well, because it's before the age of Pope.

39:27.884 --> 39:29.326
Pope comes in at the Civil War.

39:29.546 --> 39:30.547
That's right.

39:30.587 --> 39:31.848
So this is beautiful paper.

39:31.868 --> 39:33.891
That's linen paper, probably, rag paper.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.396
Well, not all these or all the other.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.622
That's not much of a sense.

39:43.642 --> 39:47.186
Tell them about this beautiful condition.

39:47.206 --> 39:47.986
Just show you.

39:48.007 --> 39:48.908
I don't know if you need this one.

39:49.148 --> 39:49.348
Beautiful.

39:50.813 --> 39:52.155
Did you have that box made?

39:52.615 --> 39:56.200
No, I didn't.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.121
And that's the five.

39:58.784 --> 40:03.329
It's almost Morocco, isn't it?

40:03.530 --> 40:06.394
I mean, Morocco-colored.

40:06.414 --> 40:07.415
Except for the Christmas carol.

40:07.435 --> 40:08.516
Except for the Christmas carol.

40:09.538 --> 40:14.284
Did he kind of lose his fire when it came to the other ones, or was the Christmas carol really special to him?

40:14.444 --> 40:20.432
Well, actually all the other ones sold better than the carol did.

40:20.682 --> 40:24.127
But, but they, they're not much.

40:24.147 --> 40:24.447
They do.

40:24.467 --> 40:26.750
They're pristine condition.

40:26.770 --> 40:28.072
Yeah, they're beautiful.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.074
How important is condition to you, Chuck?

40:31.016 --> 40:35.622
Oh, well, you try and get the best you can.

40:38.786 --> 40:41.870
I really got those just because they're really just good.

40:41.890 --> 40:48.559
I want to write that down.

40:48.579 --> 40:49.440
Well, onwards.

40:50.686 --> 40:59.076
Well, then everybody started writing a holiday book.

40:59.096 --> 41:00.738
That opened the floodgates, didn't it?

41:00.798 --> 41:01.719
That opened the floodgates.

41:03.341 --> 41:03.741
I don't know.

41:03.861 --> 41:05.523
He did it.

41:05.543 --> 41:06.504
I never realized that.

41:06.745 --> 41:15.895
Here's one that's just a slavish copy.

41:15.916 --> 41:17.217
Were there any piracies?

41:18.935 --> 41:19.455
Oh, yeah.

41:19.576 --> 41:23.499
As they were, say, with Doyle, you know?

41:23.519 --> 41:25.341
Of course, he was the victim of rape piracy.

41:25.902 --> 41:27.343
Oh, I got it.

41:27.363 --> 41:28.744
I bet you have some, yeah.

41:28.764 --> 41:33.229
But here's a book, The Faces of the Fire.

41:34.149 --> 41:36.312
You can see that's just a slavish copy.

41:37.332 --> 41:45.280
It's the same red ribbed cloth, same size, same everything as the Dickens books.

41:45.496 --> 41:48.039
What do you mean by slavish?

41:48.680 --> 41:52.184
I mean, it was... Meant to?

41:52.224 --> 41:54.427
Meant to be replicative, in other words, right?

41:54.447 --> 41:58.752
I mean, it was just... A knockoff.

41:58.812 --> 42:00.394
It was a knockoff.

42:01.675 --> 42:03.137
It's exactly the same.

42:04.519 --> 42:08.483
Except for the writing.

42:08.623 --> 42:14.170
Now, you talk about the...

42:14.960 --> 42:15.641
piracy.

42:17.323 --> 42:29.877
Within two months of the publication of The Christmas Carol, there were productions of it on the London stages.

42:30.298 --> 42:30.578
Wow.

42:31.339 --> 42:32.320
Within two months.

42:33.822 --> 42:36.485
These are the playbills.

42:36.945 --> 42:40.810
These are the playbills.

42:41.230 --> 42:41.951
Of two of them.

42:43.173 --> 42:44.494
And these are the

42:45.571 --> 42:56.465
These are Leach's original sketches of the drawings that went into the Cricket on the Hall.

42:58.227 --> 43:01.751
Just to briefly interrupt, Jack, do you mind if I take a couple of pictures of you?

43:01.771 --> 43:02.552
Not at all.

43:02.572 --> 43:03.513
Okay, thanks.

43:03.774 --> 43:07.899
Please keep talking.

43:07.919 --> 43:13.806
The ball on Christmas Eve and Fezzy's warehouse thing, that's incredible.

43:15.440 --> 43:19.724
Well, these were pirated versions.

43:19.744 --> 43:21.045
They were pirated versions.

43:21.065 --> 43:25.369
And they had, actually, they had very little to do with the book itself.

43:26.730 --> 43:31.394
They were, in fact, one of them was a musical.

43:31.475 --> 43:31.835
Oh, no.

43:33.356 --> 43:33.657
Boy.

43:33.757 --> 43:35.518
They really didn't have anything to do with the book.

43:36.459 --> 43:39.922
But they were very successful, and he didn't make a penny out of them.

43:42.324 --> 43:45.227
And then it was also

43:45.798 --> 43:47.920
published in various countries.

43:49.282 --> 43:50.583
These are the first editions.

43:52.565 --> 43:59.593
This is the first edition printed in the United States in 1844.

44:03.036 --> 44:12.827
And here you'll see that for some reason, instead of having Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig on the front, he used Marley's ghost.

44:13.748 --> 44:15.670
But this was all pirated.

44:16.443 --> 44:22.229
He didn't get a nickel out of these.

44:22.910 --> 44:30.077
This was the gift book, printed as a Christmas cow, a Christmas cow present for a gift book.

44:32.500 --> 44:37.965
And there I did use the fuzzy wigs.

44:37.985 --> 44:42.450
The one exception was in Germany, where

44:45.046 --> 44:48.429
I'm going into too much detail here.

44:51.592 --> 45:07.027
Tauschnitz had gotten permission in England to print English copies in Germany, in Leipzig.

45:07.127 --> 45:09.609
And he printed this.

45:09.870 --> 45:11.391
This may have actually come out.

45:11.978 --> 45:15.202
Two or three days before the Christmas Carol came out in England.

45:15.282 --> 45:16.243
Is that right?

45:17.024 --> 45:18.285
They beat him?

45:18.305 --> 45:23.051
Boy, he's a beautiful boy.

45:23.071 --> 45:23.512
Nicely done.

45:23.532 --> 45:32.062
But he was subject to piracy all over the place.

45:32.082 --> 45:34.344
Would you say Dickens is the heart of the collection?

45:35.706 --> 45:38.509
Or is it one of these synergistic collections where everything is?

45:40.171 --> 45:40.872
I wouldn't say so.

45:45.188 --> 45:49.812
Maybe, but... When you think of what the facts are in terms of, it's fabulous.

45:50.193 --> 45:54.877
And just, would you estimate the number of books that you have here?

45:55.157 --> 45:56.138
Well, I have about 3,500.

45:56.158 --> 45:57.919
3,500?

45:59.521 --> 46:02.203
Most of the children's books out there are back in boxes.

46:02.343 --> 46:07.568
How many children's books?

46:07.668 --> 46:11.432
I don't know.

46:11.992 --> 46:14.014
The only children's books I have out here.

46:14.939 --> 46:17.703
a piece of children's books.

46:17.723 --> 46:20.646
And they're all, mostly they're all very old.

46:20.967 --> 46:30.459
Now if you could explain why, how does little women rate inclusion in the collection?

46:30.860 --> 46:35.766
There must be, I don't remember, there must be a great Christmas scene in there, that would be my guess.

46:43.677 --> 46:47.507
I didn't realize the book was that big.

46:50.335 --> 46:53.504
I've never seen a first Little Women for some reason.

46:54.306 --> 46:56.472
All the books I've seen could be the first one.

47:11.504 --> 47:12.165
He's smiling.

47:12.785 --> 47:14.567
Playing Pilgrim?

47:14.587 --> 47:14.787
Christmas.

47:14.807 --> 47:15.648
Playing Pilgrim.

47:15.888 --> 47:16.769
The first word.

47:17.230 --> 47:23.616
The first word is, Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents grumbled, Joe, lying on the rug.

47:24.717 --> 47:30.202
What a silly question for me to ask.

47:30.223 --> 47:33.286
I don't know your little women, Nick.

47:33.306 --> 47:34.106
My little Nicole.

47:34.707 --> 47:37.950
I've been trying to get that little woman for years.

47:37.970 --> 47:39.311
Is that a recent acquisition?

47:39.332 --> 47:40.853
Yeah, I got it in the last few hours.

47:40.985 --> 47:42.827
Well, you're not as long as that at all, are you?

47:43.707 --> 47:46.750
Do these go on the outside or the inside?

47:46.770 --> 47:47.150
On the inside?

47:47.170 --> 47:48.592
Well, here's a question for you, John.

47:48.632 --> 47:57.420
Since the Royal Year Exhibition, which was three years ago, you've probably made some major additions since then.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.101
Oh, I have.

47:59.902 --> 48:00.983
So that I don't miss it.

48:01.843 --> 48:09.270
Well, for instance, one of them is that signed First Christmas Card, signed by...

48:10.702 --> 48:18.029
That was quite a wonderful exhibition.

48:23.755 --> 48:39.510
Well, on the—one second—on the strength of the exhibition, we've written up very nicely in the New York Times.

48:40.587 --> 49:00.368
And on the effect of that, Paul Gottlieb, who was the head of the public's uniform, and the system and asked me to write a book, if I'd like to write a book by Christmas.

49:01.073 --> 49:02.535
Oh, there it is.

49:02.555 --> 49:05.220
Is that the one that's going to be published by Adrian?

49:05.240 --> 49:06.942
That's the one that's... Oh, isn't it a beautiful cover?

49:06.962 --> 49:08.765
That's a rufflepuff cover.

49:08.785 --> 49:08.945
Oh, wow.

49:08.965 --> 49:16.517
Have you ever had a story like in Smithsonian about your collection or anything like that?

49:16.537 --> 49:20.604
Is that something that we're interested to, you think?

49:20.624 --> 49:21.365
Oh, look at the back.

49:21.926 --> 49:27.134
What's the puffier on this?

49:28.035 --> 49:29.157
Yeah, the author of this.

49:32.326 --> 49:39.333
Isn't that wonderful?

49:39.373 --> 49:41.255
That's a great picture.

49:41.275 --> 49:43.217
Should I leave the cover with him?

49:43.237 --> 49:44.118
Maybe you can go that.

49:44.358 --> 49:45.119
That's beautiful.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.683
That's a nice picture.

49:49.043 --> 49:49.764
That's wonderful.

49:50.245 --> 49:51.786
Oh, you must be very proud of that.

49:51.886 --> 49:52.967
That's Nast.

49:53.688 --> 49:55.610
Is that Nast?

49:56.251 --> 49:57.872
That's beautiful.

49:57.892 --> 49:59.454
Did Nast do the coloration on that?

50:00.175 --> 50:00.375
Yeah.

50:01.402 --> 50:19.161
Oh yes, they're round, it's freezing.

50:19.722 --> 50:24.287
This is like Christmas.

50:24.335 --> 50:26.357
This is one of the collections, by the way.

50:26.477 --> 50:27.278
This is Eisenhower.

50:27.298 --> 50:28.139
This is Dewey.

50:28.319 --> 50:28.940
Oh, my goodness.

50:29.080 --> 50:29.921
I didn't get to see those.

50:30.021 --> 50:31.063
I was just looking at that.

50:31.083 --> 50:35.568
This is Jack Elliott with appreciation and best wishes, Ronald Raymond.

50:37.410 --> 50:39.852
Pretty impressive.

50:39.872 --> 50:46.880
There's Elliott made with the Queen of England.

50:46.900 --> 50:47.121
Oh, my God.

50:47.221 --> 50:47.541
Oh, my God.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.689
Oh, look at that.

50:51.769 --> 50:54.352
Isn't that lovely?

50:55.854 --> 51:00.399
December 16th, 1981 in the New York Times.

51:04.263 --> 51:10.630
December 16th, 1981.

51:11.651 --> 51:12.933
Chuck, this is a great photograph.

51:13.053 --> 51:15.455
Could you tell us a little bit about this picture here?

51:15.596 --> 51:17.798
Oh, we got married in London.

51:17.947 --> 51:19.609
Isn't that the wedding day?

51:19.629 --> 51:20.570
That's our wedding day.

51:20.910 --> 51:23.633
Oh, my goodness, it's beautiful.

51:23.753 --> 51:25.274
We got married in 1986.

51:25.294 --> 51:26.876
Oh, that's a beautiful portrait.

51:26.896 --> 51:28.538
We got married in this chapel.

51:29.579 --> 51:29.699
St.

51:29.739 --> 51:32.882
Margaret, in Westminster.

51:32.902 --> 51:33.122
St.

51:33.283 --> 51:36.826
Margaret, the church right next to Westminster Abbey.

51:36.846 --> 51:39.108
Yeah, magnificent.

51:39.269 --> 51:42.552
I'll go in there, huh?

51:42.572 --> 51:43.573
Very nice.

51:43.593 --> 51:44.254
What is this book?

51:44.714 --> 51:45.675
Okay, look at this.

51:45.695 --> 51:46.536
Look at the treasure.

51:48.659 --> 52:02.253
Isn't that wonderful?

52:02.814 --> 52:04.976
Just go back to that title page again.

52:05.016 --> 52:08.019
I'll get a photograph of it.

52:08.159 --> 52:14.366
Isn't that beautiful?

52:15.027 --> 52:16.388
Oh, look at that.

52:22.595 --> 52:24.918
Do you know this book?

52:24.938 --> 52:25.419
No, I don't.

52:26.540 --> 52:28.042
It looks like a type written.

52:28.603 --> 52:28.964
It is.

52:29.865 --> 52:31.988
Now, could you tell us a little bit about what this book is?

52:33.230 --> 52:37.315
Well, it is a description of it.

52:39.799 --> 52:44.545
First folio.

52:44.565 --> 52:46.087
Boy, he's already got the jacket.

52:46.107 --> 52:46.948
Isn't that wonderful?

52:47.990 --> 52:49.071
Inventing Christmas.

52:49.432 --> 52:51.775
How our traditions came to be in the title.

52:52.463 --> 53:18.555
actually it's probably how holiday transportation smart chris folio walter w schumach s-c-h-n-a-u-c-h christmas literature a bibliographical study with the trial here y-a-o of old father christmas

53:30.213 --> 53:33.540
It's 25th Day of Christmas.

One fun of 500 copies.

53:36.806 --> 53:42.096
Trial of Old Father Christmas was published by Hill in 1937, an old edition of my copies by the Torch Press.

53:42.818 --> 53:49.107
There are several pencil corrections in the text, the manuscript, and a typewriter with the illustrations and borders handwritten.

53:49.167 --> 53:50.208
So this is the manuscript.

53:50.228 --> 53:51.110
This is the type script.

53:54.194 --> 53:59.642
Actually, Eric Holzenberg quoted my attention to it.

53:59.662 --> 54:00.843
Eric is terrific, yeah.

54:02.626 --> 54:03.727
Okay, back.

54:03.747 --> 54:08.094
This is the Dutch Santa Claus.

54:09.135 --> 54:09.776
Is that the Dutch Santa Claus?

54:09.836 --> 54:12.640
Sinterklaas in Black Peter.

54:13.025 --> 54:14.267
Isn't that interesting?

54:15.849 --> 54:19.574
Look, here's the Christmas game of Dickens for old and young.

54:19.714 --> 54:22.718
One of his admirers of all these little games.

54:22.738 --> 54:24.340
Old Christmas by Washington.

54:24.440 --> 54:27.103
That's very interesting, too.

54:27.123 --> 54:28.986
That would even predate Dickens, wouldn't it?

54:30.628 --> 54:41.743
Well, that came out just right at the same time.

54:41.763 --> 54:42.103
Well,

54:42.505 --> 54:44.468
We're always.

54:44.488 --> 54:45.409
Everything is bad.

54:46.150 --> 54:48.653
I just want to let you know that it's ten minutes to voyage.

54:48.973 --> 54:50.696
I'm going to hold on the road.

54:50.716 --> 54:51.136
Oh, boy.

54:51.316 --> 54:51.917
We're lucky.

54:52.458 --> 54:55.722
We're too hard.

54:56.783 --> 54:57.184
Okay.

54:57.284 --> 55:01.449
Give me a... When should I insist?

55:02.010 --> 55:02.871
Oh, no, no, no, no.

55:02.891 --> 55:10.381
Come on.

55:10.401 --> 55:12.023
Here's all the night before Christmas.

55:15.007 --> 55:22.134
Those are all the Naples.

55:22.475 --> 55:22.695
Wow.

55:30.263 --> 55:41.655
This is a copy of that cover.

55:52.570 --> 56:00.300
Oh, that's the condition of that.

56:00.320 --> 56:05.627
I love masks.

56:05.748 --> 56:09.893
Even Betsy Shirley doesn't have masks.

56:09.973 --> 56:11.255
She's such a nice lady.

56:11.275 --> 56:13.278
We're interested in meeting her and her husband.

56:13.498 --> 56:13.919
Carl.

56:14.700 --> 56:16.502
Yeah, very nice.

56:26.067 --> 56:38.708
That's magnificent.

56:39.068 --> 56:42.354
Isn't that beautiful?

56:42.474 --> 56:45.299
That's what the color's going to be.

56:45.319 --> 56:47.422
And this is going to be up far?

56:47.803 --> 56:49.606
It's being pretty right now.

56:50.607 --> 56:51.028
Oh, boy.

56:54.704 --> 56:58.368
That was a great idea that Gottlieb had.

56:58.528 --> 57:01.531
You can't miss Gottlieb with the fellow that had a baby.

57:02.171 --> 57:02.752
I know his name.

57:02.772 --> 57:03.793
He set the exhibition.

57:03.813 --> 57:05.494
Wonderful.

57:05.654 --> 57:06.996
It's wonderful.

57:07.436 --> 57:09.939
It'll be a keepsake of everything together.

57:10.059 --> 57:14.143
It would be nice to have it all.

57:21.890 --> 57:23.952
Murder for Christmas.

57:26.142 --> 57:34.911
Now, on Santa Claus, these are the first printing of it.

57:36.533 --> 57:41.277
First printing in books, first printing in magazines.

57:42.719 --> 57:44.621
Here's a signed copy by Moore.

57:46.042 --> 57:51.708
Here's the first illustrated edition.

57:52.108 --> 57:55.812
And then all the different illustrators of it.

57:57.108 --> 57:58.870
Have you tried a bibliography of this?

58:00.291 --> 58:02.473
Have you tried to prepare a bibliography of the collection?

58:02.633 --> 58:04.214
Well, I have it all in the arts.

58:04.234 --> 58:04.915
Oh, you do?

58:04.935 --> 58:05.415
Oh, good.

58:05.676 --> 58:11.761
In fact, the stuff that's down in the study that we were just doing.

58:12.381 --> 58:17.206
It's down there because I haven't cataloged it yet.

58:17.226 --> 58:18.207
Well, how about the Nast?

58:18.287 --> 58:23.651
Because he did Santa in numerous versions in the Harpers Weekly.

58:23.671 --> 58:25.613
Do you get the Harpers Weeklys, too?

58:30.318 --> 58:33.983
Well, this is one of them.

58:34.023 --> 58:34.184
Yeah.

58:34.204 --> 58:36.387
Oh, that's colored, too.

58:36.907 --> 58:38.630
That's the 1865.

58:38.770 --> 58:41.174
That's one of the very early things.

58:42.656 --> 58:48.164
And that was where he was starting to hit his stride.

58:48.184 --> 58:48.404
Yeah.

58:48.965 --> 58:50.206
He still didn't have it, though.

58:50.247 --> 58:53.351
He still didn't have the traditional Santa just yet with that one.

58:53.471 --> 58:54.212
Here they are.

58:54.232 --> 58:55.995
Look at these kind.

58:56.015 --> 58:59.700
This is the Christmas drawings for the human race.

58:59.849 --> 59:01.371
By Thomas Mann.

59:01.471 --> 59:02.953
I've never seen that book.

59:04.896 --> 59:05.957
Have you ever seen that book?

59:08.461 --> 59:09.622
Good for you.

59:09.662 --> 59:17.212
He did a picture, he's holding the picture real quiet.

59:18.334 --> 59:25.103
He did a Christmas picture every year for Harper's Weekly until 1886.

59:26.345 --> 59:28.067
And they were usually of Santa Claus.

59:29.667 --> 59:30.388
We have one.

59:32.931 --> 59:33.671
You have the original?

59:34.452 --> 59:35.333
Unfortunately not.

59:35.373 --> 59:38.617
We have him on the roof as he arrives in the sleigh.

59:40.559 --> 59:48.027
We bring it out every Christmas.

59:48.167 --> 59:53.413
No, that's not it.

59:58.338 --> 59:59.579
Oh, that's not it.

59:59.599 --> 01:00:02.562
Those are great, though, I think.

01:00:02.582 --> 01:00:03.643
It could be that one.

01:00:03.663 --> 01:00:07.927
Does that one come out?

01:00:07.947 --> 01:00:08.768
Oh, they're wonderful.

01:00:08.808 --> 01:00:09.989
They are.

01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.490
Look at them.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:11.791
I love nests.

01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:12.592
I do, too.

01:00:12.612 --> 01:00:13.112
We all do.

01:00:13.653 --> 01:00:16.616
Oh, that's great.

01:00:16.636 --> 01:00:18.157
That's the one you've got up there.

01:00:18.177 --> 01:00:20.119
No, no.

01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:22.521
There wasn't chrysantha every year.

01:00:22.541 --> 01:00:24.123
See this?

01:00:24.143 --> 01:00:25.324
The years were chrysantha.

01:00:26.705 --> 01:00:28.627
That one, it was great.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:33.191
That's the classic.

01:00:39.437 --> 01:00:40.498
That's the classic.

01:00:40.518 --> 01:00:47.645
That one's a pipe.

01:00:47.985 --> 01:00:56.053
Now, I wonder what to show you.

01:00:58.193 --> 01:01:00.755
Could you tell us what this picture is on the wall over here?

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:03.598
This picture, this wonderful picture of Santa?

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:05.860
That's Al Hurstville.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.142
That's Al Hurstville.

01:01:10.645 --> 01:01:10.765
Okay.

01:01:10.785 --> 01:01:12.647
I like this.

01:01:12.707 --> 01:01:15.930
Maybe it's a different color too.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:19.874
It's wonderful though, isn't it?

01:01:19.894 --> 01:01:20.254
Yeah, I love it.

01:01:22.657 --> 01:01:24.338
There's a book called Christmas Tide.

01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:26.360
It had some little homers in it.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.281
We have that one.

01:01:27.301 --> 01:01:28.082
Do you have that one?

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:32.413
I guess some of the engravings?

01:01:32.934 --> 01:01:33.935
Christmas Tide.

01:01:35.357 --> 01:01:36.318
You know what?

01:01:36.338 --> 01:01:38.820
Well, I've got several Christmas Tides.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.082
Oh, good.

01:01:40.102 --> 01:01:41.283
Okay.

01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:45.087
So you don't have to find it.

01:01:45.227 --> 01:01:50.613
In fact, I don't think I might see it right there.

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:54.417
It's Christmas in a... Yeah, I know, sure.

01:01:54.437 --> 01:01:55.338
I just saw it.

01:01:55.358 --> 01:01:55.618
It's famous.

01:01:56.499 --> 01:01:59.082
These are Christmas... This is Christmas poetry.

01:02:00.682 --> 01:02:03.505
Carols.

01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:04.446
Poetry.

01:02:04.466 --> 01:02:05.426
Carols.

01:02:05.446 --> 01:02:06.287
Cards.

01:02:06.367 --> 01:02:07.028
Brightstones.

01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:10.451
I'm pretty much sure.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.994
Etches by Boz over there, I see.

01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:17.918
Boz was sticking to his personal illustrator.

01:02:26.346 --> 01:02:30.570
This is the first printing of Milton's

01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:43.295
That's the first picture of Milton.

01:02:43.495 --> 01:02:46.459
That's famous.

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:57.773
That's a heavy duty book.

01:02:59.828 --> 01:03:20.768
Now, my favorite Christmas book, Christmas thing, is, uh, Ballad of the Harp Weaver.

01:03:20.788 --> 01:03:29.717
And, uh, again I've got a

01:03:30.592 --> 01:03:40.065
I have unquestionably the most expensive collection.

01:03:40.085 --> 01:03:40.706
Have you ever read that?

01:03:40.726 --> 01:03:41.467
No, I haven't.

01:03:41.487 --> 01:03:41.968
I'm going to read it.

01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:50.520
Well, Elliot, I'll read it to Elliot every Christmas week.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.662
It's your favorite story.

01:03:52.443 --> 01:03:53.544
It's a poem.

01:03:54.045 --> 01:03:56.388
It's a poem.

01:03:56.849 --> 01:03:59.012
It's the Ballad of...

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:27.852
There were fifteen copies of each of these little, and they were used for window displays.

01:04:30.903 --> 01:04:32.144
They're all different colors.

01:04:36.989 --> 01:04:40.913
Look at the red one, green, orange, yellow, blue.

01:04:40.933 --> 01:04:42.134
They made very decorative.

01:04:44.356 --> 01:04:46.138
When did you discover the poem, Jack?

01:04:46.218 --> 01:04:49.121
Is it something that goes back to your youth?

01:04:49.141 --> 01:04:53.085
Oh, no, rather years ago.

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:58.851
Well, I've got every part of it.

01:05:00.923 --> 01:05:29.375
A little bit more.

01:05:29.395 --> 01:05:29.715
One of them is .

01:05:30.758 --> 01:05:32.561
at one point.

01:05:32.581 --> 01:05:38.029
It's just one of them is a proof.

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:43.097
They're all signed by... Could you just read us a verse from one of the poems?

01:05:43.137 --> 01:05:44.920
I'd love to hear you.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.886
I know you probably don't have time for the whole poem, but I'd love to hear you.

01:05:48.906 --> 01:05:52.271
I think it's a poem that you celebrate every Christmas with.

01:05:53.152 --> 01:05:57.259
That would be quite a treat for us, I think.

01:05:57.279 --> 01:05:57.860
We should keep it up.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.382
It's quite a treat for us all the time.

01:06:02.264 --> 01:06:18.364
Son, said my mother when I was knee-high, You've need of clothes to cover you, not a rag of rye.

01:06:19.285 --> 01:06:25.693
There's nothing in the house to make a boy britches, Nor shears to cut a cloth with, nor thread to take stitches.

01:06:26.674 --> 01:06:29.217
There's nothing in the house but a loaf end of rye,

01:06:30.091 --> 01:06:32.674
And a harp with a woman's hand, nobody will buy.

01:06:33.776 --> 01:06:35.177
And she began to cry.

01:06:36.819 --> 01:06:41.305
And oh, but we were silly for half an hour or more with me, with my long legs.

01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:42.346
Yes?

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:46.051
That is so sad.

01:06:46.231 --> 01:06:47.312
That is so sad.

01:06:47.553 --> 01:06:48.774
Wait.

01:06:48.874 --> 01:06:58.326
Thank you.

01:07:01.208 --> 01:07:02.129
That's fabulous.

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:06.855
My brother was just calling up to say he was going to come down.

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:07.496
That's wonderful.

01:07:07.596 --> 01:07:09.318
Congratulations.

01:07:09.378 --> 01:07:11.541
That's a wonderful university.

01:07:12.122 --> 01:07:15.386
And you're very dedicated to the books and the library there in Mississippi.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:17.188
You gave a talk down there last year.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:18.430
Do what?

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.172
I gave a talk at Duplex.

01:07:20.192 --> 01:07:21.033
No, no, no.

01:07:21.174 --> 01:07:26.821
I'm a collector and collecting and stuff there.

01:07:26.901 --> 01:07:27.462
Friends.

01:07:28.203 --> 01:07:30.085
In fact,

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:33.173
Bill Bice's wife is of it.

01:07:33.213 --> 01:07:35.256
She was down there.

01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:36.799
That's right.

01:07:38.982 --> 01:07:43.148
Could you tell me why that poem in particular moves you so profoundly?

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:49.558
Honey, why does that... Oh, hold on, I'm sorry.

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:56.949
Oh, it's just a beautiful poem.

01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:59.953
Yes.

01:08:00.558 --> 01:08:02.521
Such a lovely Christmas poem.

01:08:03.463 --> 01:08:06.007
Sacrifice.

01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:10.034
Love of mother and son and all that.

01:08:10.054 --> 01:08:13.941
My mother's frozen, trying to weave the clothes for her little boy.

01:08:15.804 --> 01:08:22.757
You know what, Jack, I think that we're going to probably thank you very much for your hospitality.

01:08:22.897 --> 01:08:24.760
No, I thank you very much.

01:08:25.516 --> 01:08:27.738
A little refreshment.

01:08:27.818 --> 01:08:32.023
We'd rather use every minute talking to you.

01:08:32.183 --> 01:08:33.444
You know what I'd like, though?

01:08:34.526 --> 01:08:36.788
I'd request... I wonder if you could inscribe.

01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:42.334
We brought a copy of the catalog of your exhibitions, and we'd love for you to inscribe it for us.

01:08:44.156 --> 01:08:45.297
I would love to do that.

01:08:46.879 --> 01:08:51.003
We could stay here for Dave.

01:08:51.504 --> 01:08:54.747
Sounds like a deal.

01:08:56.093 --> 01:08:58.077
Where's the stuff?

01:08:58.097 --> 01:09:06.653
Well, not all red years ago.

01:09:07.315 --> 01:09:10.120
She's so pretty out here.

01:09:16.225 --> 01:09:36.530
to his man he lived with all his life.

01:09:36.931 --> 01:09:38.493
Memories.

01:09:39.234 --> 01:09:45.962
And did he find Christmas holiday?

01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:58.433
It's wonderful.

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:24.904
Lovely.

01:10:26.525 --> 01:10:44.142
Terrific.

01:10:44.162 --> 01:10:45.563
Just so lovely, just so peaceful.

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:45.783
Beautiful.

01:10:45.803 --> 01:10:46.524
Sit and enjoy the food and the food.

01:10:46.544 --> 01:10:46.864
Excellent.

01:10:46.884 --> 01:10:47.505
Cross that key, too.

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:52.133
There's just an interesting spelling of Eliot, two L's and two T's.

01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:55.917
Well, it's about every way.

01:10:57.378 --> 01:11:02.463
There were two kinds of Eliot's, the Scottish Eliot's and the English Eliot's.

01:11:03.564 --> 01:11:05.926
The English Eliot's which T.S.

01:11:05.946 --> 01:11:06.827
Eliot was one.

01:11:07.888 --> 01:11:11.211
They probably came over from France years ago, allio.

01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:16.176
And they tend to be one L and one T.

01:11:17.118 --> 01:11:28.872
Most usual, Elliot, Scottish, Scots came over from, uh, from, uh, Scandinavia, probably, Allen, Helen, something like that.

01:11:28.892 --> 01:11:35.841
And they had two L's and one who was here, most usual.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:41.467
You, sir, are you going to show us one other thing I can say?

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.370
Oh, cool.

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:44.811
Oh, is this what Chris is?

01:11:44.831 --> 01:11:45.052
Oh, yeah.

01:11:45.312 --> 01:11:46.213
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:11:49.433 --> 01:11:55.862
No way.

01:11:55.882 --> 01:11:57.469
Oh, boy.

01:11:58.478 --> 01:11:59.600
Thank you so much.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.821
I do so much.

01:12:01.422 --> 01:12:01.663
Connie?

01:12:01.683 --> 01:12:05.748
Would you like to use the bathroom?

01:12:05.969 --> 01:12:06.610
No, we're fine.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:10.675
I've left my pocketbook in the other room.

01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:13.499
I want to ask you a question.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.524
You have this book coming out.

01:12:17.265 --> 01:12:20.970
Would you be interested in my proposing an article on your collection?

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:24.435
If somebody likes to fill the magazine, I can't guarantee the bill.

01:12:24.989 --> 01:12:29.636
I'll publish it, but I think it would be wonderful for Christmas.

01:12:29.736 --> 01:12:30.377
I'd love to go.

01:12:30.397 --> 01:12:31.399
It would be very timely.

01:12:31.719 --> 01:12:33.261
And it would be something that I would write.

01:12:33.342 --> 01:12:45.820
We need to talk about your collection, and maybe I could call Abrams, maybe I could even get a set of the galleys of the book, but I'll propose it to Smithsonian if this is something you'd be interested in.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.723
I absolutely would be interested in it.
