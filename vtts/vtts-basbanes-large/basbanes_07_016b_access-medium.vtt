WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:04.061
pretty tricky.

00:04.401 --> 00:06.464
Yeah, so there it is.

00:11.830 --> 00:14.614
Yeah, it's got to be Red Riding Hood, don't you?

00:15.014 --> 00:16.937
Look at the house, the book house, Chloe.

00:17.377 --> 00:18.839
Yeah, it's not kind of fun.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.561
I got carried away.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.465
But I think this is great.

00:23.605 --> 00:29.352
This is... Oh, that's... This is me.

00:29.392 --> 00:30.473
Those are miniatures, right?

00:30.613 --> 00:31.995
Yeah, they're all...

00:34.372 --> 00:39.480
Oh, American, that's wonderful, American religious.

00:40.381 --> 00:45.209
Look, and the title, I said the book house, and then the title of the book actually is the book house.

00:45.229 --> 00:45.850
It's the book house.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.232
That's the way it came out.

00:48.153 --> 00:48.574
That's lovely.

00:48.594 --> 00:49.956
And it was so just like that?

00:49.976 --> 00:50.217
Yeah.

00:50.677 --> 00:52.140
Yes, got it, as is.

00:52.921 --> 00:54.303
Isn't that great?

00:54.383 --> 00:59.451
See, I really didn't want anything that late, but then I thought that to go with that, you know.

01:00.055 --> 01:01.117
Do you enjoy it?

01:01.397 --> 01:02.699
Yes, I do enjoy it.

01:02.719 --> 01:03.921
You have to make exceptions.

01:05.002 --> 01:10.450
Yeah, and some of them are good illustrators.

01:10.790 --> 01:13.034
Is that a case like a bookcase?

01:13.354 --> 01:15.397
I don't know.

01:15.437 --> 01:17.841
This is one of those twirling bookcases.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.303
That's great.

01:19.323 --> 01:21.205
I saw somebody with one of those.

01:21.686 --> 01:24.690
I think it was Milt Reisman, who was a New York book dealer.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.792
I said, wait, you get that.

01:25.812 --> 01:27.915
And then I thought, that's the thing to have.

01:28.917 --> 01:29.978
And then one day,

01:30.228 --> 01:33.532
wandering on 3rd Avenue or somewhere.

01:33.572 --> 01:36.495
I still want to write that and grab it.

01:36.515 --> 01:38.477
Oh, and then plus the card file.

01:38.497 --> 01:44.243
And the card file, I try to remember to make out the cards and what I paid for them.

01:44.263 --> 01:50.370
So that was one, two, three, four, five, six.

01:50.390 --> 01:51.592
Do you work at it regularly?

01:52.112 --> 01:52.673
Yeah, I do.

01:52.693 --> 01:53.714
I honestly do.

01:54.435 --> 01:57.038
Yeah, and I'm way behind.

01:57.478 --> 02:00.201
But I do, I really do.

02:00.485 --> 02:04.890
I don't want to press the question, but would you say you're obsessive, you're an obsessive collector?

02:05.130 --> 02:05.791
Sure.

02:05.811 --> 02:06.712
Don't you think so?

02:07.433 --> 02:09.856
Aren't all collectors?

02:11.918 --> 02:12.860
Don't you think so?

02:14.321 --> 02:18.526
When I tell you the title of my book, you'll see.

02:22.050 --> 02:26.796
That's Yale.

02:27.130 --> 02:31.956
Oh, aren't you wonderful?

02:32.617 --> 02:34.339
This is great, I think.

02:34.479 --> 02:35.921
I'm very proud of that.

02:35.941 --> 02:36.942
Oh, look at that.

02:36.962 --> 02:39.445
This is the Garden of a Child's Garden of a Dream.

02:39.606 --> 02:42.229
Oh, the New York Public one.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.971
Oh, these are wonderful.

02:45.453 --> 02:48.717
Uh, this is what Bernie was...

02:49.844 --> 02:51.346
He was editor of that.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.449
I have these at home, so I can just, I have these.

02:54.469 --> 02:55.890
It's December 86, right?

02:56.091 --> 02:58.633
Yeah, and this... 1986.

02:58.754 --> 03:02.938
I wrote about that thing, but as I said, you asked Bernie, because he left.

03:02.958 --> 03:03.679
Oh, no, he did.

03:03.859 --> 03:05.180
Oh, yes, I remember that.

03:05.781 --> 03:09.585
Yeah, what do you think of that?

03:09.665 --> 03:10.346
I remember that.

03:10.806 --> 03:12.448
They put that on there.

03:12.468 --> 03:14.430
Which date is that?

03:14.450 --> 03:15.151
July of 91.

03:15.471 --> 03:17.033
Yes, this is it.

03:17.053 --> 03:19.716
But let me show you what that stinker, Bernie.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.490
I told you my spelling's terrible.

03:24.872 --> 03:29.496
And so here's my article on Santa Claus.

03:30.457 --> 03:38.485
But what he left was, I wrote reindeer, D-E-A-R.

03:39.106 --> 03:41.468
Somewhere he didn't correct it.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.110
And I said that was a dirty trick.

03:44.130 --> 03:45.232
You know, I thought it was so funny.

03:47.013 --> 03:48.775
I can't remember where it is now.

03:49.058 --> 03:55.087
Well, you'll see that it says D-E-A-R, and I said, did you miss that?

03:55.107 --> 03:55.888
And he said, no.

03:55.988 --> 03:59.333
I just thought it was so funny I left it.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.777
I think that's pretty funny.

04:01.957 --> 04:02.257
Sure.

04:02.838 --> 04:10.449
Now, I'm looking for New York Public Library.

04:12.452 --> 04:13.033
There.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.475
Oh, thank you.

04:14.860 --> 04:15.201
85.

04:15.621 --> 04:15.781
Wow.

04:16.783 --> 04:19.568
Well, you've been pretty... So I've been busy.

04:19.588 --> 04:20.209
A busy woman.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.093
Are you going to let us take it?

04:23.113 --> 04:26.438
Yeah, I was going to say you can have all three because I've got... Would you kindly inscribe?

04:26.699 --> 04:26.959
No.

04:28.181 --> 04:28.822
Please.

04:29.003 --> 04:36.454
That would be lovely.

04:36.474 --> 04:39.680
This is a little lemento of our visitor.

04:40.020 --> 04:41.863
I think I smell lunch.

04:42.923 --> 04:46.106
These are Maxfield Parish's proof from other groups over here?

04:46.126 --> 04:49.230
Proof for bombs from other groups.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.413
Now, all of these followed the book collection, is that right?

04:52.493 --> 04:54.335
You started doing books before these?

04:54.515 --> 04:57.939
I started doing books before these and then got into these.

04:58.619 --> 05:01.362
But these are every book are part of the collection.

05:01.522 --> 05:02.183
Oh, yeah.

05:02.483 --> 05:02.764
Yes.

05:03.284 --> 05:03.545
Yes.

05:03.665 --> 05:06.187
Is this part of the collection that will go to Yale as well?

05:06.588 --> 05:07.649
Most of them.

05:07.669 --> 05:10.652
Some of them won't, but some of them will.

05:11.678 --> 05:19.448
And I've given a couple to the brandy wine, just because we know all those guys down there.

05:19.568 --> 05:21.110
This is Hammett Billings.

05:21.791 --> 05:23.112
I've never found the book.

05:23.753 --> 05:31.323
The only way I know I haven't found it is that the priest in the house that Jack built doesn't have a hat on.

05:31.383 --> 05:35.728
And all the ones I've got, he has a hat on.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.336
All the houses look like this.

05:38.496 --> 05:41.079
Jack looks pretty much like this.

05:41.860 --> 05:44.283
It's the only one, yeah.

05:44.724 --> 05:47.487
Did these come as individual plates, or did you frame them?

05:48.088 --> 05:48.929
I framed them.

05:49.069 --> 05:49.750
I framed them.

05:49.770 --> 05:53.054
They were individual plates from somebody's collection.

05:53.835 --> 05:54.416
They're wonderful.

05:55.898 --> 05:59.122
This is kind of fun, only because they're in such good condition.

05:59.683 --> 06:03.808
This is cards that you bought to put an album.

06:04.244 --> 06:08.090
And it's Prang, who is a big lithographer.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.311
Oh, Louis Prang from Boston.

06:09.331 --> 06:16.602
Yeah, and it came looking just like this, and I thought it looked so nice, I'd better frame this.

06:16.642 --> 06:17.062
Yeah.

06:17.403 --> 06:18.485
Prang is so tough.

06:18.585 --> 06:20.107
He's very collectible now, actually.

06:20.127 --> 06:23.752
Yeah, and they're all just, these two are a little dark.

06:23.772 --> 06:25.054
From all of that?

06:25.979 --> 06:31.143
That was the, you know, that's, uh... Apocadarian, I guess you'd call it.

06:31.164 --> 06:32.665
Yeah, they did.

06:32.705 --> 06:33.345
He died.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.386
What's his name?

06:36.608 --> 06:37.349
Apocadarian.

06:37.369 --> 06:39.130
That looks like the original principal.

06:39.431 --> 06:42.453
It's a study, because I have the book.

06:42.473 --> 06:48.018
It's a study for the dust jacket of that book.

06:48.579 --> 06:49.620
I know this book.

06:49.820 --> 06:55.885
You know this book, and I've got... We might even have a... For the moment, I can't remember.

06:56.675 --> 06:57.696
Mm-hmm.

06:57.716 --> 06:58.757
Darn it, I can't remember.

07:00.519 --> 07:03.062
But that's what they call it, and that, and that— Provenas.

07:03.142 --> 07:04.884
Provenas.

07:04.904 --> 07:05.424
Here it is.

07:07.026 --> 07:07.727
Provenas.

07:08.187 --> 07:08.928
Provencin.

07:09.188 --> 07:09.969
Provencin.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.391
There, there.

07:11.511 --> 07:13.072
He just recently died.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.558
This is, again, Gillette Burgess.

07:18.578 --> 07:18.718
Mm-hmm.

07:18.738 --> 07:25.045
And this is, guys, trying to think, is, uh— These are splendid here, though.

07:25.835 --> 07:28.878
That's the box, right?

07:28.898 --> 07:29.799
Oh, they're fun.

07:29.819 --> 07:30.079
Yeah.

07:30.640 --> 07:30.920
Yeah.

07:32.001 --> 07:33.142
That's great.

07:33.162 --> 07:33.763
Now, let me see.

07:33.783 --> 07:43.052
I think we'll... Hey, yes.

07:43.292 --> 07:49.618
This is Walt Disney's study for... Oh, no.

07:49.638 --> 07:50.739
No, wait.

07:50.759 --> 07:51.760
No, wait.

07:51.780 --> 07:52.821
Is that the Disney study?

07:52.919 --> 07:54.222
I mean, it comes from the studio?

07:54.622 --> 07:56.346
Yes, it isn't one of the cellular ones.

07:56.366 --> 07:57.628
No, I like that better.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.852
Yeah, I like it better.

07:59.872 --> 08:03.720
This is Wanda Gag, Woods Blanc.

08:03.740 --> 08:07.187
Can't find what that's from.

08:07.247 --> 08:09.090
Isn't that something?

08:09.170 --> 08:10.232
Do you make different kinds of things?

08:10.273 --> 08:11.174
Yes, yeah.

08:11.515 --> 08:13.138
That's another Winslow Homer, right?

08:13.507 --> 08:14.568
Is that a homer again?

08:14.889 --> 08:17.232
No, that's... Oh, gosh, that's one I want to show you.

08:17.252 --> 08:18.173
It's up in the jar.

08:18.674 --> 08:20.736
It's in the jar.

08:20.756 --> 08:22.038
It's the one I wanted to see.

08:22.138 --> 08:23.500
Okay, we'll take a look at it one way down.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.504
This is Anton Otto Fisher.

08:27.505 --> 08:37.018
And he... Carl said he couldn't wait to get... I think it was a Collier's magazine that he used to do when Carl was a boy.

08:38.099 --> 08:41.944
This is...

08:42.802 --> 08:48.668
This is another dolly here.

08:48.889 --> 08:51.151
Which one was then for you, with your name on it?

08:51.171 --> 08:51.912
That was me.

08:52.152 --> 08:55.876
That was Gene Burns, who did regular fellows with a cartoon.

08:56.877 --> 09:00.221
And I think he appeared every week, or maybe it was Sunday.

09:00.241 --> 09:01.022
That's what it says.

09:01.102 --> 09:02.523
It's a big lie, Mr. Duffy.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.986
We sailors have not got Goyles in every port.

09:05.006 --> 09:09.771
I only got one Goyle, and here she is, Betsy Shirley.

09:10.223 --> 09:12.187
He's a nice guy.

09:12.207 --> 09:12.889
Jane B.Y.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.613
Everett.

09:14.633 --> 09:15.274
This I love.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.377
It's a poster.

09:16.477 --> 09:18.261
Oh, that's splendid.

09:18.381 --> 09:19.524
Which I think is great.

09:19.544 --> 09:21.568
It's advertised as a children's book.

09:21.628 --> 09:25.858
Yeah, but that's a lithograph, too.

09:26.058 --> 09:26.178
Yes.

09:26.559 --> 09:29.245
And she was a lady illustrator.

09:29.782 --> 09:33.106
went to Ireland on vacation and never appeared again.

09:33.387 --> 09:34.268
Something else.

09:34.288 --> 09:37.091
Must be a good story.

09:37.111 --> 09:37.992
Look how this is done.

09:38.133 --> 09:42.018
Arabella and Ara Minta, stories by Gertrude.

09:42.038 --> 09:44.100
But look how it just keeps going on the line.

09:44.781 --> 09:49.287
Gertrude Smith with 15 pictures by Ethel Reed.

09:49.727 --> 09:53.132
And that was one of the Peter Parley books.

09:53.152 --> 09:54.253
That's why I got it.

09:54.273 --> 09:56.616
Also, because I think Art Deco is one of them.

09:57.085 --> 10:04.234
And that's the cover for a McWalfin magazine.

10:04.314 --> 10:06.016
I've never found that magazine either.

10:06.036 --> 10:08.058
And again, that's original artwork, right?

10:08.078 --> 10:09.119
Yes, for it.

10:10.501 --> 10:15.267
These were obviously Robinson Crusoe.

10:15.287 --> 10:17.550
Which collection feeds the other now?

10:17.570 --> 10:21.114
Does the art feed the book collection or does the book collection feed the other?

10:21.534 --> 10:21.795
Books first.

10:21.855 --> 10:22.616
The books come first.

10:22.676 --> 10:22.936
Yeah.

10:23.076 --> 10:23.717
Books first.

10:24.372 --> 10:33.506
That's a dust jacket for Father Goose's book.

10:34.748 --> 10:36.931
And I found the dust jacket on the book.

10:36.971 --> 10:37.492
Oh, you did?

10:37.512 --> 10:37.832
Oh, great.

10:37.852 --> 10:39.114
Which is great.

10:39.134 --> 10:40.717
Oh, that's bomb.

10:40.737 --> 10:40.897
Yeah.

10:42.119 --> 10:46.645
And then that's, that's Bemelman's.

10:46.665 --> 10:51.072
And it's a study for, because it's not exact, it's a study for...

10:51.338 --> 10:54.021
Madeline's Rescue, I think, is the book.

10:54.442 --> 10:54.742
Yeah.

10:54.882 --> 10:56.284
E-E-M-E-L-N-A-N.

10:56.324 --> 10:58.867
That's Shin for the night before.

10:58.887 --> 10:59.407
That's lovely.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.088
That's funny.

11:00.108 --> 11:02.811
Yeah, that's nice.

11:02.831 --> 11:05.254
The little red dot means it's going to Atlanta, right?

11:05.274 --> 11:06.656
Yeah.

11:07.156 --> 11:09.018
This is kind of interesting.

11:09.038 --> 11:15.726
You know, really, cause this is by, I never heard of him, and I got it from Justin.

11:16.094 --> 11:17.996
But he is in the Metropolitan.

11:18.016 --> 11:20.940
His name is something like Simeon Shinn.

11:22.802 --> 11:32.874
Yeah, there it is.

11:33.555 --> 11:39.402
S-H-I-N-S-S-Y-M-S-S-H-I-N-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-

11:39.685 --> 11:42.567
And I looked up the date, and I think it's 1968.

11:42.587 --> 11:44.569
1968, yeah.

11:44.769 --> 11:45.930
Yeah, 68.

11:46.631 --> 11:54.438
And I knew that Maurice Sendak did the first book that had a little boy with no pants on it.

11:54.538 --> 11:56.099
Nobody was going to allow it.

11:56.720 --> 12:02.064
And he told me that in libraries they could cover him up still.

12:02.485 --> 12:02.765
Yes.

12:03.586 --> 12:06.228
And I thought, gee, how'd you get away with that?

12:06.308 --> 12:08.730
Then I noticed that when the thing came out,

12:09.065 --> 12:12.889
The little boy always has a diaper on, so they must have.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.732
It's a story about a little boy in the desert.

12:16.593 --> 12:20.377
Obviously, he wouldn't have had pants on, and they must have made him put pants on.

12:20.397 --> 12:23.180
But, I mean, at least the artist put the pants on.

12:23.200 --> 12:28.865
You don't think that they... No, I think they probably said to him, we can't, unacceptable this way.

12:29.086 --> 12:29.686
I don't know.

12:31.128 --> 12:33.250
This, this, I can't find that.

12:33.736 --> 12:41.305
And here we have the tail of a donkey in the bathroom by Valenti Angelo.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.687
Yeah, I've got all his worksheets for that.

12:43.828 --> 12:48.313
I just thought at some time it'd be fun to show this is how a book is made.

12:48.453 --> 12:52.938
So I've got the worksheets, because he wrote the book and did the illustrations.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.340
Valenti Angelo, I'll write him down.

12:54.820 --> 13:01.107
Now, he's sort of modern, and that's one of those celluloids.

13:01.127 --> 13:03.490
Do you get to know, I mean, know in terms of

13:04.027 --> 13:05.970
You get to know all the authors.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.474
Personally, you mean?

13:09.554 --> 13:13.600
No, no, I mean in terms of knowing their work.

13:13.620 --> 13:14.181
Can I spawn it?

13:14.201 --> 13:14.721
You mean?

13:14.962 --> 13:18.006
Oh, things that you like are things that are important for the collection.

13:18.226 --> 13:27.739
Well, you know, somebody will take me, I've got such and such.

13:28.748 --> 13:35.097
I guess I'm always trying to get the old things in their hearts and they're harder to find.

13:35.117 --> 13:37.942
Efforts to do color illustrations.

13:38.663 --> 13:42.188
And so somebody came to Justin's... Didn't this just come out a little while ago?

13:42.248 --> 13:44.852
No, it came out in... What's the date?

13:44.872 --> 13:46.274
I just looked it up.

13:46.314 --> 13:48.017
What came out with the reissue?

13:48.037 --> 13:49.399
Yeah, no, I meant to be reissue.

13:49.419 --> 13:50.060
1960.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.362
No, it's not.

13:51.422 --> 13:52.203
It's 32 years.

13:52.764 --> 13:53.645
That's the original art?

13:54.106 --> 13:55.768
That's the original art for this.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.265
Then Scribner's was, and there's the original end paper.

13:59.285 --> 14:02.628
Oh, the original end paper is over here.

14:03.749 --> 14:07.853
And then they were going to do a paperback.

14:07.873 --> 14:11.116
You see, he would hit the spine when it folded over.

14:11.156 --> 14:12.977
And they never did issue it.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.099
Oh, this is a beautiful color.

14:15.119 --> 14:17.842
So in place of the wools.

14:17.862 --> 14:19.223
Did you see where the spine was?

14:19.263 --> 14:21.625
Yeah, he's got it in place.

14:21.645 --> 14:22.386
Isn't it perfect?

14:22.406 --> 14:23.427
Do you think he wanted that?

14:23.812 --> 14:31.459
Oh, on purpose, because it was commissioned for the paperback edition, and then scriveners didn't do a paperback.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.342
Either they didn't have the money, or something happened.

14:34.362 --> 14:35.944
Signed by Ernest H. Shepard.

14:36.004 --> 14:36.364
Yeah.

14:36.905 --> 14:44.332
And so, what happens is that Justin calls and says, uh, guess what I have?

14:45.053 --> 14:46.975
That sets the budget off.

14:47.075 --> 14:49.377
I might like to take a picture.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.678
Oh, terrible.

14:51.119 --> 14:53.481
Do you want to go to the John?

14:54.710 --> 14:55.351
You all right?

14:56.091 --> 14:56.392
Bye.

14:56.472 --> 14:57.653
I'm so excited.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.575
This is so pretty.

14:59.675 --> 15:02.258
Well, I have to go to John, and I'll be right back.

15:02.378 --> 15:04.640
I'll be right back.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.162
I'll take a picture of the art.

15:06.742 --> 15:08.164
I love the way she had those.

15:08.184 --> 15:13.489
Those are the boys, of course.

15:13.509 --> 15:16.252
Aren't they cute?

15:19.895 --> 15:21.237
They're his rifles.

15:21.297 --> 15:22.438
Aren't they lovely?

15:31.160 --> 15:41.214
The American edition.

15:41.234 --> 15:44.638
When you say when I say G, you're talking about what again?

15:46.601 --> 15:54.872
Uh, Shepard was an English illustrator, not an American illustrator, but Wind in the Willows is a wonderful book, and

15:55.527 --> 16:03.026
Kenneth Graham was English, but these were done for the first, for the 50th anniversary American.

16:03.708 --> 16:04.630
And there's the Homer.

16:05.653 --> 16:05.773
Homer.

16:06.936 --> 16:08.440
Does that mean anything to you?

16:09.432 --> 16:14.518
I can't read it either.

16:14.638 --> 16:16.900
I hate that kind of story.

16:17.221 --> 16:22.607
I had a review book of his come in the other day, and I said, I should try, because I'm a book critic, to try one.

16:22.687 --> 16:24.269
I told Claudia I can't do it.

16:24.829 --> 16:35.041
Peter just thinks that, uh, I think you have to be on another Grandchild Collects Mad magazine.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.142
Well, that's a good collection.

16:36.443 --> 16:37.684
And, uh,

16:39.098 --> 16:47.694
The other boy's looking for a 1967, something about the Boston Celtics.

16:47.814 --> 16:51.241
The other, Betsy's three children aren't interested, really.

16:52.222 --> 16:53.445
Now you say none of your children?

16:53.886 --> 16:56.030
None of your children are interested.

16:56.270 --> 16:57.232
We have two girls.

16:58.153 --> 17:00.077
What are their names, can I ask?

17:00.142 --> 17:02.768
Yeah, Betsy is Betsy Michelle.

17:02.868 --> 17:03.009
Uh-huh.

17:03.370 --> 17:06.798
She's a lawyer, and she lives only about 15 minutes.

17:06.958 --> 17:07.519
Uh-huh.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.243
She's also a lawyer.

17:10.346 --> 17:12.371
And all three children went to Yale.

17:12.391 --> 17:12.531
Uh-huh.

17:13.118 --> 17:17.926
And Jody is also a lawyer, and she lives in Milton, Mass.

17:18.006 --> 17:20.791
She's divorced, and she has three boys.

17:21.051 --> 17:23.155
Those are three gorgeous boys that are up to school.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.256
Yeah, but they're cute.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.160
Yes, they're just great.

17:26.180 --> 17:28.844
That was last winter, so that's up today.

17:29.605 --> 17:30.286
This is all.

17:30.306 --> 17:32.750
You see, I haven't gotten to cataloging.

17:32.911 --> 17:35.515
On this far, you can see, but it can't be enough.

17:35.495 --> 17:37.018
A catalog.

17:37.058 --> 17:38.641
You've done all this work yourself, right?

17:38.981 --> 17:39.602
All the catalog.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.105
That's quite amazing.

17:41.746 --> 17:44.772
In fact, that's worth a picture, Con.

17:44.792 --> 17:45.533
My mother was.

17:45.553 --> 17:46.255
Yes.

17:46.796 --> 17:50.102
At least you know that they're enjoyed.

17:50.402 --> 17:55.131
Do you have this organized by subject, or is it near, or is it by author?

17:55.331 --> 17:55.832
This is all by...

17:56.116 --> 17:59.500
My man by the name of Jacob Abbott.

18:00.781 --> 18:03.685
And I gave a lot of them to Amherst, which I wish I hadn't.

18:03.885 --> 18:05.247
Now, Jacob Abbott.

18:05.267 --> 18:10.092
Does Amherst have a small collection?

18:10.413 --> 18:12.275
Your collection is there, a small collection of it?

18:12.635 --> 18:14.197
Amherst, I don't know.

18:14.217 --> 18:16.780
They had a lot of his, and I had so many of them.

18:17.041 --> 18:23.148
I gave later editions, and I don't think I could look at any more of them.

18:23.168 --> 18:25.110
I mean, I'm still having trouble getting it.

18:25.377 --> 18:29.702
These are all, I don't collect school books really.

18:29.722 --> 18:31.323
But there they are.

18:31.343 --> 18:34.166
This is the kind of thing missionaries did.

18:35.308 --> 18:40.493
This is English and Chinese reader, missionary to Chinese.

18:40.513 --> 18:43.677
This is 1882.

18:44.658 --> 18:49.543
But they did this in Greece and Sandwich Islands and you name it.

18:49.563 --> 18:54.388
I think they were restless and it was a great excuse to get the hell out of

18:54.858 --> 18:58.703
the house and go somewhere, that you might volunteer to be a missionary.

18:58.723 --> 19:01.005
I wish I could be neat like this, Connie.

19:01.025 --> 19:04.169
This is really... I'm not impressed, but I got it pretty well.

19:04.329 --> 19:14.721
And this is all, this is all hobbies, uh, uh... Book for boys.

19:14.782 --> 19:15.803
That kind of thing.

19:17.104 --> 19:23.151
Astronomy, how to put on a circus, electricity, you know, that kind of thing.

19:23.171 --> 19:24.493
These are more recent, I think.

19:25.047 --> 19:30.412
Uh, some of them, some aren't.

19:33.075 --> 19:35.998
Some are, uh, uh, there's the one on dancing, for instance.

19:36.038 --> 19:36.418
That was?

19:36.438 --> 19:37.359
That was Tim.

19:37.379 --> 19:39.621
Dancing as a Social Amusement.

19:39.642 --> 19:40.522
From 1835.

19:40.683 --> 19:46.188
Dancing as a Social Amusement by Professed Christians for their children.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.430
So, this is that kind of thing.

19:48.470 --> 19:50.632
God, what a forbidding title, huh?

19:50.993 --> 19:53.215
Yeah, Book for Boys, you know.

19:55.203 --> 19:59.307
Phileal virtues of Washington, uses of that insect.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.609
Do you try to stop that foxing at all?

20:01.629 --> 20:03.611
I can't do anything about it.

20:03.631 --> 20:05.693
I don't think it gets any worse here.

20:06.554 --> 20:10.378
But some of them, some of the old paper is great still.

20:11.118 --> 20:13.881
And this is all Christmas.

20:13.901 --> 20:14.241
Right here.

20:16.684 --> 20:19.646
So, oh, and this is ABCs.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.328
This and this.

20:22.118 --> 20:25.222
Do you remember enjoying children's books when your children were little?

20:25.242 --> 20:28.807
Did you always enjoy them, or were you different?

20:28.827 --> 20:33.893
No, I used to read my brother's books, mainly.

20:33.913 --> 20:41.804
And for the kids, yes, I think, you know, we did, we didn't.

20:41.844 --> 20:49.113
Justine and me, I was always, my father was six to nine years, and almost back and forth to New York.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.455
Me too.

20:51.278 --> 20:53.361
Let's call them modern.

20:53.381 --> 21:00.191
They're pretty much 1920s on up.

21:00.992 --> 21:08.323
And these really are mostly, some are by author and some are by the illustrator.

21:08.343 --> 21:11.648
These are all Sendak's, for instance.

21:11.688 --> 21:15.494
They're, just because I think he's... The illustrator?

21:15.514 --> 21:15.714
Yeah.

21:15.834 --> 21:16.375
I thought he saw.

21:16.557 --> 21:17.939
Did you see the I Saw Esau?

21:18.219 --> 21:20.062
No, but I think she had it.

21:20.082 --> 21:21.804
Yeah, because that just got illustrated.

21:22.485 --> 21:25.249
Yeah, they just did a first illustrated of that.

21:25.810 --> 21:26.150
Of which?

21:26.391 --> 21:27.132
I Saw Esau.

21:27.933 --> 21:28.293
Sendak.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.578
Candlewood Press in Cambridge just did a new edition of that.

21:32.018 --> 21:33.941
Oh, that's what you did with Mrs. Elfman.

21:33.961 --> 21:34.942
With Mrs. Elfman.

21:34.963 --> 21:35.764
I've got it up.

21:35.784 --> 21:36.244
Okay.

21:36.264 --> 21:37.947
And I haven't really had time to look at it.

21:37.967 --> 21:39.268
It's quite lovely.

21:39.289 --> 21:39.969
Is it good?

21:39.989 --> 21:41.151
Yeah.

21:41.171 --> 21:42.273
You did a lovely job.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.417
Here are... This is...

21:45.667 --> 21:53.056
American history, these relate to that, or geography, or natural history.

21:53.677 --> 22:02.087
I can really see now, having seen this, why this, why Yale would be thrilled to have this, because this is a very comprehensive collection.

22:02.107 --> 22:02.567
It is comprehensive.

22:02.587 --> 22:04.109
It's a library, yeah.

22:04.169 --> 22:09.876
A scholar, I see a number of monographs and PhD theses out of this, you know?

22:09.896 --> 22:10.577
I hope they do.

22:11.478 --> 22:14.762
These are, oh, these are the, uh,

22:15.400 --> 22:17.002
And I haven't got them all, of course.

22:17.262 --> 22:20.825
But as I see them, I pick them up if I can remember the title.

22:20.885 --> 22:24.329
These are all Coltercott and Newbery winners.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.813
And then these are all too big to fit in over there.

22:28.833 --> 22:32.177
But Dr. Seuss, for instance.

22:32.197 --> 22:32.617
Pretty funny.

22:32.757 --> 22:33.298
Interesting.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.339
Yeah, those are nice.

22:35.881 --> 22:35.981
Yeah.

22:36.001 --> 22:37.842
These are some of the ones they did early.

22:38.183 --> 22:39.444
Oops, I'm sorry.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.728
Let me show you the cover.

22:43.748 --> 22:45.390
How do you like that?

22:45.826 --> 22:47.528
Unbelievable.

22:47.568 --> 22:48.830
It's about 1890.

22:48.850 --> 22:49.591
That's gorgeous.

22:49.991 --> 22:51.814
It's just terrible.

22:51.834 --> 22:52.855
And look at the fabric.

22:52.995 --> 22:54.677
But it's a terrible book.

22:55.038 --> 22:55.919
1884.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.581
And what's the title again?

22:58.542 --> 22:59.563
Even Little... Seven.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.747
Seven Little Maids.

23:02.767 --> 23:05.431
And so take off, you see, on Kate Greenaway.

23:06.472 --> 23:14.061
By Mary... But then they did... These were wonderful-looking books.

23:14.081 --> 23:15.343
Call it Victoria...

23:15.965 --> 23:30.144
That's an unusually good condition because they were kind of hard.

23:30.164 --> 23:36.953
So then we run from there to annuals, you know, gift books.

23:37.013 --> 23:38.876
This is natural history here.

23:40.438 --> 23:42.661
I'd guess about 4,000, 3,000 books.

23:42.681 --> 23:42.821
I know.

23:43.082 --> 23:45.685
This is Mother Goose and Fairy Stories.

23:45.985 --> 23:48.828
Oh, there's a Nonsense Books by Edward Lear.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.049
Yes, humor.

23:50.490 --> 23:54.033
And, oh, these are, and they came out quite early.

23:54.093 --> 23:56.275
Not these, but others came out early.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.499
These are words of one syllable.

23:59.519 --> 23:59.999
The whole book?

24:00.239 --> 24:00.540
Yeah.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.023
And they started doing those in the 1830s.

24:05.505 --> 24:07.306
This is another one I was finding.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.988
Isn't that one?

24:09.008 --> 24:09.569
It's great.

24:09.929 --> 24:10.810
You can see what that was.

24:10.870 --> 24:12.091
Oh, this is all Mother Goose.

24:12.211 --> 24:14.794
I've got really good Mother Goose collection.

24:15.719 --> 24:22.347
Then these, these are biographies.

24:23.889 --> 24:32.059
And these, yeah, these are the, you know, in wrappers.

24:32.259 --> 24:32.960
Where is?

24:33.080 --> 24:35.383
Those are beautiful.

24:38.907 --> 24:40.309
Just because you'd like to see that.

24:40.329 --> 24:42.672
I mean, this is quite extraordinary, really.

24:45.200 --> 24:53.368
Life of Lucy G. Thurston, pioneer missionary.

24:56.952 --> 25:09.045
This is the one that Homer didn't do, but he did the, he did the, it's in that book.

25:09.065 --> 25:11.427
Remarkable history of five little pigs.

25:13.364 --> 25:15.908
showing the adventures of, etc.

25:16.208 --> 25:21.055
He did the mice one, not this one.

25:21.075 --> 25:22.077
It looks kind of like that?

25:22.577 --> 25:24.340
Yeah, it looks exactly like that.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.442
I've got it somewhere.

25:26.122 --> 25:27.464
Where did Betsy put it?

25:27.725 --> 25:29.487
I don't know, though.

25:29.567 --> 25:30.309
That's okay.

25:30.849 --> 25:33.053
And this is Mr. Dickens.

25:33.073 --> 25:38.100
He said he was... Well, he's cheating again, though, isn't he?

25:38.120 --> 25:38.741
According to the Betsy?

25:38.761 --> 25:40.023
No, they're American editions.

25:40.083 --> 25:40.283
Oh, okay.

25:40.921 --> 25:46.049
This is one of his readings that he must have done in Worcester, maybe?

25:46.069 --> 25:46.410
Maybe.

25:46.910 --> 25:47.311
Maybe.

25:48.954 --> 25:50.055
All Dickens, my God.

25:50.095 --> 25:53.080
No, this is Dickens, these two shelves.

25:53.100 --> 25:57.948
And then these are books that are pre-1900 that I don't know where to put.

25:59.090 --> 25:59.590
But they're nice.

26:00.292 --> 26:00.612
Oh, yeah.

26:01.113 --> 26:01.554
I don't know.

26:01.574 --> 26:03.517
I haven't decided where they should go.

26:03.637 --> 26:06.942
Do you ever go to little bookstores and flea markets?

26:07.042 --> 26:07.603
Of course.

26:07.735 --> 26:08.536
Of course.

26:08.796 --> 26:09.277
Yeah.

26:09.377 --> 26:10.238
Yeah.

26:10.719 --> 26:12.421
Oh, sure.

26:12.782 --> 26:23.056
But I don't as much, because I keep thinking, God, I've got to get these organized and... Do you ever make a great find?

26:23.817 --> 26:24.698
Oh, sure.

26:24.718 --> 26:24.798
Yes.

26:24.858 --> 26:25.299
Yes.

26:25.319 --> 26:33.851
Like, Marcus wasn't speaking to me, because if I could find something Marcus doesn't have, I'd love it all the better.

26:33.871 --> 26:34.772
You know, he's...

26:35.427 --> 26:46.843
He's so competitive, except that my kids say the great secret about Mother is she's as competitive as anyone we know.

26:47.624 --> 27:01.283
But he did have, in the whatever the magazine comes out, he had about a, they'd just gotten a Cherokee

27:02.663 --> 27:04.925
I guess it was.

27:04.945 --> 27:06.686
I forget what the date is.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.890
And he went away locally in Morristown.

27:10.910 --> 27:13.412
I found one a year earlier.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.995
What's his name?

27:17.055 --> 27:19.657
Head of the Indian tribe.

27:19.677 --> 27:20.878
Was he speaking to you?

27:20.978 --> 27:21.859
I couldn't wait.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.781
I don't think so.

27:23.801 --> 27:32.248
Well, you know as if it didn't mean too much, but it did.
