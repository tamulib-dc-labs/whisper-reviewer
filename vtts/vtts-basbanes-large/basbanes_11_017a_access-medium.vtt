WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:04.278
It's running now.

00:05.980 --> 00:06.881
Okay, thank you.

00:08.463 --> 00:09.044
It's running.

00:09.064 --> 00:09.825
I apologize.

00:09.885 --> 00:14.811
So we were talking about your responsibilities here.

00:14.831 --> 00:24.422
Yes, I'm responsible for general planning and coordination for the projects and also responsible for information systems.

00:25.704 --> 00:29.228
Could you tell me, you also work with the

00:29.866 --> 00:35.775
the computers and the digitization process, the scanning of text.

00:35.835 --> 00:44.108
Could you tell me a little bit about your plans for computerizing and digitizing the system, the collections?

00:45.010 --> 00:47.033
Yes, as you know, it's a big project.

00:48.235 --> 00:57.409
We say now that it's about a 10-year project, starting from 1988.

00:57.625 --> 01:27.497
was with the announcing by the president of the project of Tolbiak where we are but it's not only a building project it's also a lot of projects and among them is the information system and the planning of entire re-information

01:27.983 --> 01:32.249
You know, the old library was already computerized.

01:33.350 --> 01:40.861
And with the new project, we plan to move the NSAM system to a new integrated system.

01:42.263 --> 01:52.337
And with this new integrated system, we intend to manage all library functions.

01:54.376 --> 02:06.071
So the new information system is sorted into about 20 main sub-functions.

02:07.933 --> 02:24.113
Part of them are front-office functions, I mean turned towards the public, and others are back-office functions made for professionals' purposes.

02:24.953 --> 02:28.577
It's a long story.

02:28.597 --> 02:49.982
We started this information project in 1991, and there were a lot of studies, but the real public bid

02:50.198 --> 02:54.603
to realize the system was launched only in 1995.

02:54.744 --> 02:56.386
Really?

02:56.786 --> 03:03.034
And we are now preparing the realization of the system.

03:04.355 --> 03:14.288
And because it's a very big integrated system, we cannot open the system, all the functions at the same day.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.290
So we

03:18.228 --> 03:21.833
organize the launching in three steps.

03:22.454 --> 03:29.643
The first step is coming next year with the opening of the research library.

03:30.324 --> 03:31.285
That is in this building?

03:31.305 --> 03:32.607
Yes, in this building.

03:33.608 --> 03:40.838
And the second step will be about six or seven months later with the main back office functions.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.986
And we have a third step in the middle of 1999.

03:48.063 --> 03:51.948
to organize the last functions.

03:53.010 --> 03:58.577
But for the equipment, we also have had a public bid.

04:00.479 --> 04:17.462
I forgot to say that realization is made by the first informatics service company in France whose name is Capgemini.

04:17.830 --> 04:18.971
Gemini.

04:19.672 --> 04:20.692
Gemini.

04:21.033 --> 04:24.936
And Capgemini worked with IBM.

04:26.397 --> 04:33.383
That was the realization of softwares, integration of softwares, and so on.

04:34.664 --> 04:47.095
And for equipment, there was also an international public bid, and Boulle, also a French company, won this bill.

04:47.530 --> 04:54.178
and Bull is associated with a lot of companies.

04:55.620 --> 04:58.323
I may quote Sequent for servers.

04:59.464 --> 05:13.662
It was an American company and also Oracle for the database system or Microsoft for some of the softwares.

05:13.682 --> 05:14.803
We work

05:15.273 --> 05:34.393
in three levels architecture, client-server architecture, with main servers, about 14 main servers, 47 inter-servers, and about 3,000 workstations running with Windows NT.

05:35.814 --> 05:42.141
Since this is our first visit to this building, will this building here primarily be

05:42.712 --> 05:47.298
devoted to computer service, or will there be reading here, books here?

05:48.159 --> 05:48.419
Yes.

05:51.824 --> 06:06.002
It's, your schedule is, it's, you, maybe it, it would be more

06:07.214 --> 06:23.693
easy to you to begin by because maybe it's necessary to explain before we are going to discuss about the information system on the project itself.

06:25.816 --> 06:33.525
The library is one of the biggest libraries in the world and now

06:34.653 --> 06:53.413
the public may access to the collection in two main sites, one in the old library near the Royal Palace in the Richelieu Street, and the other, this new building, is open to the public since December 1996.

06:55.796 --> 07:04.305
And the idea is to move here all the printed books collections and all the audiovisual collections.

07:04.960 --> 07:15.012
And the other collections remaining in the old site will be the stamps, music, engravings, maps, and so on.

07:15.032 --> 07:18.396
All that we call special collections.

07:19.697 --> 07:23.262
So the first idea is that one.

07:23.762 --> 07:33.634
This is a unique library with two main sites, one dedicated to special collections and the others in where we are.

07:34.255 --> 07:39.743
is the building dedicated to printed material and audiovisual.

07:40.865 --> 07:51.741
And another idea is to offer to general public some books and audiovisual on information.

07:52.562 --> 07:55.026
So the building is split in two levels.

07:56.308 --> 08:00.955
One level for general public and the other for research.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.783
All four buildings are split into two levels?

08:06.365 --> 08:10.529
If you see the building from here.

08:11.711 --> 08:12.712
Oh, it's all one building.

08:12.732 --> 08:13.272
Oh, I see.

08:13.392 --> 08:13.873
Okay.

08:14.013 --> 08:15.114
Oh, we didn't see that.

08:15.435 --> 08:15.535
Okay.

08:15.695 --> 08:20.560
You have the four towers, but the towers are only for professional purposes.

08:21.641 --> 08:24.764
In the upper levels, you have storage levels.

08:24.784 --> 08:30.030
And in the seven first levels, you have offices.

08:31.343 --> 08:52.402
The library itself for the public is in this rectangular shape, the garden in the middle, and in the view of the garden you have the first level, you may see it very clearly from here.

08:53.023 --> 08:58.988
The first level is for the general public with open stacks collections, and then

08:59.440 --> 09:04.187
beneath, you have the research level.

09:04.708 --> 09:16.766
And the level we opened in December was the general public, with the exhibition rooms, auditoriums, reading rooms, 10 reading rooms.

09:17.447 --> 09:26.140
And we are going to open the research level at about mid-1998, but now it's not really open.

09:26.457 --> 09:31.283
And we are now in a project phase.

09:31.864 --> 09:42.156
I mean, we are preparing the removal of printed material coming from the old library, ten millions of books, to coming to this library.

09:42.176 --> 09:42.436
Ten millions?

09:42.456 --> 09:43.117
Ten millions, yes.

09:43.137 --> 09:46.201
And are they in the process of coming out here now?

09:46.241 --> 09:47.082
Yes, yes.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.612
Do you know the rate at which they're coming, by chance?

09:50.573 --> 09:58.222
You may ask a lot of questions to my colleague Jacqueline Sanson, who is responsible for this part of the project.

09:59.444 --> 10:08.975
So when I explained that we are planning to open the new information system with the research level, it's a sense.

10:09.035 --> 10:14.642
It means that it comes with the opening of this level.

10:14.662 --> 10:17.085
So this is a general idea.

10:17.740 --> 10:21.703
When you say open to the public, are these books that they can borrow?

10:21.984 --> 10:24.626
Are these for circulation, so they all must be read on premises?

10:24.886 --> 10:27.829
Yes, only on the premises.

10:27.849 --> 10:33.914
And there's a big difference between the first level and the second.

10:34.715 --> 10:44.183
In the general public, books are acquired from the bookshops and so on.

10:44.203 --> 10:46.785
And this is not, there are not,

10:46.985 --> 10:52.613
as we say, patrimonial collections.

10:52.693 --> 10:59.083
It's not the old collection, it's not a collection coming by the legal deposit and so on.

10:59.603 --> 11:02.948
It's a collection we bought for the public.

11:03.469 --> 11:07.595
General circulation kinds of things, but not to be circulated outside the building.

11:07.615 --> 11:07.695
Yes.

11:09.938 --> 11:14.145
It looks very different here from our view coming in.

11:14.265 --> 11:15.827
Yes, because

11:16.111 --> 11:22.038
Yeah, this project is included in the vast urbanism project.

11:22.779 --> 11:34.894
All the quarter here coming from the highway lane on the east side to one of the big railway stations of Paris.

11:35.415 --> 11:39.660
All this quarter is now in change.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.822
Rehabilitation.

11:40.902 --> 11:41.963
Yes, rehabilitation.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.207
And this will become

11:45.743 --> 11:49.708
a large place in Paris.

11:50.389 --> 11:59.881
And this place has organized the circulation between the quarters of Paris.

11:59.901 --> 12:14.620
And in next year, maybe two, three or four years, we should have a bridge for pedestrians coming from the south side of the Seine River and the north side.

12:15.140 --> 12:21.470
I think the president of France wanted this to be the anchor, so to speak, of the whole redevelopment of this part of Paris.

12:21.490 --> 12:34.089
Yes, it was the first building to be built, and FranÃ§ois Mitterrand clearly wanted to have not only a building, but also the first step of the new quarter of Paris.

12:34.109 --> 12:39.037
And that's the explanation of the huge place.

12:39.517 --> 12:43.864
It's not only the place for the library, it's a place for everybody.

12:44.182 --> 12:47.185
Now it's a new quarter, so it's just coming.

12:48.146 --> 12:58.116
Public transportation is coming, but we shall have next year a new subway station very close from here.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.180
So where did the subway come now?

13:01.440 --> 13:06.465
We have a subway station on that side.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.328
We have two bus stations.

13:09.848 --> 13:38.691
uh the main subway station will be open in uh over next year in 1998 so it's really one building of from this from the road it looks like four buildings yes but it's only one it's one building yes it's about uh 350 000 square meters 350 000 yes so

13:38.890 --> 13:40.312
Are any books stored?

13:40.452 --> 13:42.615
Will books be stored in these four towers?

13:42.935 --> 13:43.176
Yes.

13:44.497 --> 14:06.687
There are already books stored in the towers because we had another storage in Versailles, in the suburbs of Paris, and in this storage we had the periodicals, official publications, and these collections are coming from Versailles to Tolbiac.

14:06.835 --> 14:09.318
And this removal is almost finished.

14:09.499 --> 14:09.859
I see.

14:10.760 --> 14:17.930
And the storage is split between the lower part of the library and the higher part.

14:18.551 --> 14:27.764
About half of the collection will be stored in this part and the other half in the towers.

14:27.784 --> 14:33.872
Of course, probably you're not the person to ask this question, but access to materials, if you're a reader,

14:34.645 --> 14:37.968
requesting material, and it's on the top four.

14:38.869 --> 14:39.049
Yes.

14:39.289 --> 14:56.885
We expect to have a process taking about 20 minutes, starting from the request of the reader to the receiving of the book, because it's the reason why.

14:59.147 --> 14:59.868
Merci beaucoup.

15:01.009 --> 15:01.129
Hello.

15:01.750 --> 15:02.010
Merci.

15:02.030 --> 15:02.691
Ãa va, Laura?

15:03.711 --> 15:04.332
Ãa va.

15:05.527 --> 15:34.318
I believe that you had some brochures

15:34.805 --> 15:48.419
booklets in English to introduce to the library, because if you need to write a book... Yes, I don't have them yet, but I hope... It's difficult to talk about this.

15:53.544 --> 15:59.631
I am writing something about the library, but it's not finished now.

15:59.871 --> 16:00.291
You are?

16:00.572 --> 16:00.832
Yes.

16:01.693 --> 16:02.854
I was asked to...

16:03.256 --> 16:08.261
to write a chapter in a book to be published in the United States.

16:10.304 --> 16:10.624
Really?

16:10.924 --> 16:13.327
Yes, on modern libraries.

16:14.148 --> 16:15.189
On modern libraries?

16:15.709 --> 16:15.889
Yes.

16:16.210 --> 16:16.650
In general?

16:17.551 --> 16:29.584
I have the title in the file, but it's somebody in the University of Hawaii who asked me that.

16:30.037 --> 16:31.379
University of which, I'm sorry?

16:31.499 --> 16:31.859
Hawaii.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.580
Oh, Hawaii.

16:33.101 --> 16:33.762
Yeah, funny.

16:34.543 --> 16:38.688
Do you have a title for your book?

16:39.229 --> 16:47.340
Yes, I may, if you'll give me your card, I may send you... Excellent.

16:47.540 --> 16:57.613
That's a great interest for... Yes, because it's a, you know, it's very complicated business, and it's very difficult to...

16:58.319 --> 17:05.167
to explain everything in a few hours, or to understand everything in a few hours.

17:06.288 --> 17:25.930
As I say, before it's a ten years project, and in this ten years project you have a lot of things coming from building, architecture, information system, with recognition of catalogs and so on, a lot of things, digitization and so on.

17:26.197 --> 17:48.838
A central concern of mine in this new book that I'm writing is the whole concept of the future library and how the computerization and the digitized book will all work into this concept of books as a part of book culture.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.821
You mentioned the word patrimony here in France.

17:51.841 --> 17:52.802
This is very important.

17:53.703 --> 17:53.983
Yes.

17:54.263 --> 17:56.085
You are in a national library.

17:56.453 --> 18:06.422
It's a very important thing to have the main concept of the library.

18:07.583 --> 18:24.199
Mitterrand changed the concept of the National Library because when he launched this project, he asked this project to be open to the general public.

18:24.365 --> 18:33.496
He asked to be, this library will be an encyclopedic library.

18:34.557 --> 18:53.460
And the National Library was an encyclopedic library before, but since about the end of the First World War, the library moved to more humanities, arts and so on.

18:54.689 --> 19:02.898
She received the legal deposits, but for acquisitions.

19:03.639 --> 19:09.746
Acquisitions were more oriented to humanities, liberal arts and so on.

19:11.628 --> 19:23.802
And Mitterrand asked the library to move again to encyclopedic orientations.

19:24.878 --> 19:34.888
that we must use new technology and open to the world, and mainly Europe.

19:34.908 --> 19:45.879
So it's not an entire new definition, but it's something like a new start for the National Library.

19:46.460 --> 19:54.868
We don't move the main missions, I mean, to work for research more than for the general public.

19:55.422 --> 20:17.362
to collect old publications in French or published in France, or to publish national bibliography to promote French culture and so on.

20:17.382 --> 20:24.568
But we enlarge the current definition of the old national library.

20:25.679 --> 20:28.282
So that's important to understand.

20:28.323 --> 20:35.011
We are not a large university library or a large public library.

20:35.372 --> 20:38.917
We are, first, a national library.

20:39.397 --> 20:45.445
It means that we are a library dedicated to study more than to the entertainment.

20:48.429 --> 20:51.113
And that explains to you that we

20:52.223 --> 21:04.938
are open to the general public, the level, the first level, we call the upper level of Ujjada, because it's high comparison of the garden.

21:04.958 --> 21:10.164
But this level, it's open to the general public for study.

21:10.385 --> 21:19.335
It's not a public or ordinary public library like a city library and so on.

21:19.435 --> 21:21.758
It's not for children.

21:22.177 --> 21:23.919
So do you have to get a reader's card?

21:24.380 --> 21:31.588
Yes, everybody has to get a reader's card, either for one day or for another.

21:32.109 --> 21:34.171
And we charge people.

21:34.452 --> 21:35.092
It's not free.

21:37.936 --> 21:43.402
We charge 20 francs a day or 200 francs a year.

21:43.442 --> 21:50.631
And if we are a student, if you are a student, you may pay half price.

21:51.455 --> 21:57.441
What you hope is that the materials that the people use, they can find it elsewhere.

21:57.862 --> 22:02.046
That you hope that they come here for things that they can't find elsewhere.

22:02.106 --> 22:04.208
Yes, that's true for the research level.

22:04.429 --> 22:13.899
So we have here all publications come from the early story of France.

22:14.399 --> 22:19.825
So the Royal Library comes from the maybe 14th century.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.193
with manuscripts and so on.

22:23.375 --> 22:35.907
And then from the 16th century, we have the legal deposit, who was created by Francois I in 1537.

22:37.208 --> 22:46.437
And so we have mainly whole books printed in France, since the origins to nowadays.

22:47.478 --> 22:49.980
And this is very

22:50.838 --> 23:01.389
So the idea is to keep these books in good health for generations.

23:02.270 --> 23:07.876
So we cannot afford to communicate, to circulate these books a lot.

23:08.417 --> 23:11.480
So it's mainly for searchers.

23:12.681 --> 23:19.849
And if people ask for a copy, microfilm, and so on, we may do it for them.

23:20.268 --> 23:26.156
You mentioned part of your mission is to keep books in good health for generations.

23:26.176 --> 23:39.574
I would assume that part of your responsibility is to select books that might be in declining health and perhaps to prevent further use of these books to make digital copies of them.

23:39.935 --> 23:43.660
Yes, it's part of my business.

23:45.563 --> 23:51.789
The idea of digitization is more to communicate books and to preserve them.

23:53.611 --> 24:03.500
The best method to preserve books is, until today, photography, microfilm.

24:04.781 --> 24:10.046
It's a sure way to preserve books for maybe centuries.

24:12.028 --> 24:14.490
We use digitization

24:15.112 --> 24:20.278
Only for a small part of the collection.

24:21.420 --> 24:27.347
Coming with the project was the idea to create a new digital library.

24:28.508 --> 24:33.975
The target was about 100 books and 300,000.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.201
Just 100 books?

24:39.221 --> 24:40.763
100,000.

24:40.943 --> 24:41.224
Okay.

24:42.445 --> 24:43.887
Pardon me.

24:44.305 --> 24:50.571
100,000 books, and 300,000 pictures.

24:53.353 --> 25:13.232
So we almost finished the printed book program, and with Mr. Menin, we'll explain to you what kind of titles we choose and what were the reasons.

25:13.837 --> 25:23.569
Our purpose is more to choose the technical way of digitize and to communicate.

25:24.831 --> 25:35.224
So the idea is to offer to the public in a workstation dedicated to digitize collections.

25:36.406 --> 25:43.675
It's like a PC computer and you may browse

25:44.093 --> 25:49.039
in the digital library with special softwares.

25:49.540 --> 25:52.284
And that is here on those lower levels?

25:52.304 --> 25:55.948
It's coming from next year with the first type of the information system.

25:56.089 --> 26:07.283
I may show you because I have samples of screens, but I cannot leave you today that kind of material.

26:13.085 --> 26:17.269
I'm going to publish an article about that.

26:19.791 --> 26:21.353
Oh, my goodness.

26:21.373 --> 26:26.017
With the samples of the screens of the future systems.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.162
But they are not available today.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.224
It's part-to-type.

26:34.465 --> 26:36.207
You mean the machines are available?

26:36.227 --> 26:36.307
Yes.

26:36.787 --> 26:42.653
So I may show you some examples.

26:47.881 --> 26:58.219
This is an example of the homepage of his workstation to access to men's services.

27:01.625 --> 27:02.366
This is in French.

27:02.927 --> 27:13.585
And this is an example of another... We have about three kinds of workstations.

27:14.071 --> 27:20.580
This will be a workstation for general public in a lot of places in the library.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.904
It's only to inform general information.

27:24.685 --> 27:42.188
So with the touch screen, you may choose library presentation, introduction to the library, map of the library, brief introduction to collections, exhibitions, auditoriums,

27:42.691 --> 27:54.161
Projects and services are here, practical information, how to go to the... what are the subway stations on.

27:54.681 --> 28:05.711
And here you have the way to reserve your seat and to reserve a book for a special date.

28:07.232 --> 28:07.453
I see.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.634
Are these the names of the buildings?

28:09.674 --> 28:10.535
Yes, it's a name.

28:10.555 --> 28:12.597
It's a time tower.

28:12.830 --> 28:15.534
Letters, towers, laws, and numbers.

28:15.774 --> 28:19.219
So this is one, two, three, four.

28:19.239 --> 28:19.840
It's time.

28:20.341 --> 28:21.022
Time is one.

28:22.604 --> 28:23.245
Time is one.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.027
Laws is two.

28:25.608 --> 28:26.449
Numbers is three.

28:27.110 --> 28:28.072
And letters is four.

28:29.834 --> 28:30.816
What is it?

28:30.876 --> 28:32.057
What does that say?

28:32.078 --> 28:32.378
Laws.

28:32.839 --> 28:39.208
Laws, okay.

28:39.228 --> 28:39.308
Yes.

28:39.328 --> 28:39.428
Laws.

28:41.872 --> 28:55.150
As you see, for this general information, the public may choose a language, so you may choose English if you are English speaking.

28:55.170 --> 29:00.538
Yes, and you may choose German, Italian, Spanish, French.

29:02.801 --> 29:06.266
This will be another kind of workstation.

29:06.566 --> 29:09.330
It's not a touch screen, it's a

29:09.597 --> 29:13.964
You can use it with a keyboard or with a trackball, with a mouse.

29:14.905 --> 29:30.971
And this is a workstation used to access the catalog or to request a document or to illustrate or to ask a book for a special day.

29:33.334 --> 29:35.638
But we were talking about...

29:38.977 --> 29:58.554
I'm coming from a meeting in Bern, and this is my slide.

29:58.754 --> 30:08.022
As you say, you see the information system is very, we are, it's not finished,

30:08.322 --> 30:20.436
It's a concept of a multimedia workstation.

30:27.664 --> 30:35.933
These are transparencies that you showed, I guess, in a lecture.

30:37.297 --> 30:40.201
How many monitors will you have, Julie?

30:40.221 --> 30:43.164
Do you have an idea of how many workstations you will have?

30:44.286 --> 30:44.366
Yes.

30:44.506 --> 30:47.009
I quoted the number before.

30:47.790 --> 30:50.393
We shall have about 3,000.

30:50.773 --> 31:00.986
About 60% for professional purposes and 40% for public.

31:01.086 --> 31:06.072
This is a sample of workstation

31:06.777 --> 31:09.381
used to access to the digital library.

31:11.224 --> 31:16.892
As you see, it's running with several windows.

31:18.134 --> 31:22.561
And here you have the main text you ask.

31:24.323 --> 31:29.331
It's the letters on education from Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

31:30.793 --> 31:35.620
And you may browse in the library by asking

31:36.190 --> 31:41.397
titles by browsing the catalogue, and then you may browse in the book.

31:42.358 --> 31:47.986
You have here what we call thumbnails, if you know, it's a technical word.

31:48.867 --> 31:54.334
In French it's the railway.

31:54.354 --> 31:56.817
The railway.

31:57.398 --> 31:59.481
And here you see

32:00.052 --> 32:02.876
the coming pages in the book.

32:02.896 --> 32:03.797
Oh, I see, sure.

32:03.817 --> 32:19.777
But you may ask the contents by double-click on that button, and you may ask the bibliographic description to go forward before.

32:20.278 --> 32:27.928
You may enlarge some details if you have written manuscripts, annotations.

32:28.789 --> 32:29.670
You may...

32:30.292 --> 32:35.919
turn the book by using this kind of button.

32:35.939 --> 32:39.524
If you have to read in a manuscript annotation.

32:40.866 --> 32:44.090
Because when it's microfilm you have to turn the whole thing.

32:44.130 --> 32:48.416
These are the upcoming pages and then probably the one previous page.

32:48.836 --> 32:52.080
And here you may add some signs.

32:52.801 --> 32:54.644
You may highlight.

32:56.526 --> 32:59.370
You may select lines and

33:00.076 --> 33:06.884
you may move these words in your personal file.

33:07.084 --> 33:08.686
So we can make a copy of this here.

33:09.106 --> 33:11.169
Can you make a hard copy of this?

33:11.189 --> 33:13.451
Yes.

33:13.471 --> 33:15.534
And your visitors will be able to do that?

33:15.634 --> 33:15.894
Yes.

33:17.396 --> 33:29.830
But we feel that we have to organize some training because it's not even if it's

33:30.198 --> 33:31.379
rather easy.

33:33.962 --> 33:40.129
You don't learn this kind of software in school or with TV.

33:40.729 --> 33:45.635
So you must have to learn to use easily this kind of software.

33:45.655 --> 33:47.977
And to demonstrate a proficiency with the equipment.

33:48.638 --> 33:59.530
And here you have the time running because we give the workstation to people, but not for every day, for all the day.

34:00.488 --> 34:13.308
Even today, when they want to have audio-visual material, they must give their name and we give them the workstation for two hours or three hours.

34:14.050 --> 34:22.463
And so it's to avoid that people keep the workstation for themselves and avoid to...

34:22.865 --> 34:26.148
to think to other people who need the workstation.

34:26.308 --> 34:27.590
But you don't have to read it here.

34:28.050 --> 34:33.155
You can locate what you want, copy it to your own file, and then read it later.

34:33.195 --> 34:35.338
The point here is to find the material.

34:35.358 --> 34:42.865
If you know about digitization, you know that we have two modes, two ways of digitizing.

34:43.686 --> 34:45.708
One way is graphic mode.

34:46.489 --> 34:48.771
It means that we

34:49.072 --> 34:57.962
we have photography of the book, we made photography of the book, and that we digitize by page.

35:00.044 --> 35:02.326
Another mode is to digitize by words.

35:02.807 --> 35:13.278
This example, it's a MoliÃ¨re Donjement, and this is digitized with text mode.

35:14.139 --> 35:17.543
So, in text mode, you may

35:18.620 --> 35:20.883
make a query by words.

35:22.045 --> 35:36.207
You may query about love in Molien, Don Juan, and see how many times in Don Juan love is used.

35:36.227 --> 35:45.100
And you may find that in the three first acts the word love is used, and no more in the fourth and the fifth.

35:45.822 --> 35:47.725
So that's a meaning for futures.

35:48.126 --> 35:48.506
Of course.

35:48.526 --> 35:54.636
Or if you're looking for a specific scene, when you remember it by a certain word, you just search for that word and it will go there.

35:55.017 --> 36:05.794
Now this, this is a, you have to scan this to get the, and so to do that, do you have to break the book up?

36:05.814 --> 36:07.637
Do you have to take out the pages?

36:08.218 --> 36:10.041
Do you have to disbound the book?

36:10.477 --> 36:12.500
to scan to get a true copy?

36:12.721 --> 36:19.171
If you want a hard copy of the page, you just have to click a button.

36:19.532 --> 36:26.944
I mean when you're scanning the original book, you have to take apart and do each individual page to scan it into the system.

36:27.064 --> 36:27.885
Is that right?

36:27.905 --> 36:28.166
Yes.

36:30.149 --> 36:32.012
Generally, we used...

36:32.836 --> 36:36.781
Photography to... Microfilm?

36:37.001 --> 36:38.163
Did you take these?

36:38.183 --> 36:38.303
Yes.

36:38.323 --> 36:38.964
Microfilm, yes.

36:39.144 --> 36:44.451
About 60% of our digitized library comes from microphones.

36:44.791 --> 36:46.173
Oh, that's very interesting.

36:46.193 --> 36:49.758
And the others, the process?

36:50.859 --> 36:56.066
The others were original books, which came from originals.

36:56.587 --> 37:01.493
And this part is another way of digitizing.

37:01.810 --> 37:14.808
It means that we, it's companies, they don't scan a page.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.431
They type it in.

37:17.451 --> 37:18.653
Keyboard it in.

37:18.673 --> 37:20.075
Yes, all the words.

37:21.837 --> 37:26.663
Yeah, that's for content, and this is a graphic representation.

37:27.084 --> 37:31.530
So this is the cheaper way of digitizing.

37:32.084 --> 37:35.507
This is expensive.

37:35.707 --> 37:36.588
Because of the labor?

37:36.929 --> 37:38.170
Because of the labor, yes.

37:39.651 --> 37:44.956
And this takes less time.

37:46.037 --> 37:55.406
And when you want to make query by words, it's possible to use special software.

37:56.086 --> 37:58.969
It's what we call OCR.

37:59.405 --> 38:04.371
It's optical recognition character.

38:05.432 --> 38:10.679
And with these softwares, you may have this kind of results.

38:11.600 --> 38:17.147
But with sometimes mistakes, because as you see here, it's an old book.

38:17.988 --> 38:26.779
So modern machines cannot recognize very well the old characters, and they make mistakes.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.288
So you have to correct these mistakes.

38:30.628 --> 38:37.095
It's not a problem if you run this software only on one book.

38:37.816 --> 38:43.622
But on 100,000, it will be very expensive.

38:43.762 --> 38:45.304
And have you done 100,000?

38:46.165 --> 38:49.368
We have done 86,000.

38:49.889 --> 38:50.189
Wow.

38:51.410 --> 38:52.652
And who made this selection?

38:53.853 --> 38:55.234
It's the Mustermanian team.

38:55.254 --> 38:55.735
OK.

38:55.755 --> 38:55.855
Yeah.

38:56.358 --> 39:02.346
So you must ask him, well, the criteria of the selection.

39:03.848 --> 39:06.411
Very important.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.312
Do you have a question?

39:07.612 --> 39:11.617
No, I just think it's very interesting what you get in the microfilm.

39:12.659 --> 39:13.340
That's a great idea.

39:13.420 --> 39:14.341
I'm not seeing this.

39:15.482 --> 39:20.609
In American institutions, they're not doing that much digitization from the original microfilm.

39:20.869 --> 39:24.694
They're going to books and taking them apart.

39:25.248 --> 39:33.160
I believe that in some libraries in America they use the same way of digitizing.

39:33.220 --> 39:38.928
It makes perfect sense.

39:39.028 --> 39:48.222
It makes sense also from an historical viewpoint because in the old books you have a lot of science.

39:49.403 --> 39:52.588
The book presentation has a meaning

39:53.547 --> 39:57.291
It's only a chain of words.

39:57.371 --> 39:57.971
Absolutely.

39:58.051 --> 39:58.372
Okay?

39:58.792 --> 40:08.542
So when you digitize this way, you never have the original presentation of the book.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.223
You just have the text.

40:10.624 --> 40:15.568
It's very important, but it's not the whole book.

40:15.809 --> 40:19.152
You try to give a sense of it here, but it doesn't do it.

40:19.172 --> 40:23.436
You don't have a feeling for the size, the binding, the kind of paper.

40:23.770 --> 40:25.011
We don't have that.

40:25.031 --> 40:30.758
And this is strictly black and white, so if there are any color illustrations there, you're not going to get that either, right?

40:30.858 --> 40:31.959
Yes, it's black and white.

40:33.661 --> 40:35.443
Early you said something very interesting.

40:35.643 --> 40:41.770
You said you know microfilm, but you don't know the future of digitization.

40:41.790 --> 40:42.551
Yes, we don't.

40:42.591 --> 40:44.293
Could you talk about it?

40:44.313 --> 40:45.654
Oh, it's quite simple.

40:45.674 --> 40:49.238
It's if you think to sound recording.

40:50.467 --> 40:54.811
And you see the story of sound recording.

40:54.831 --> 41:02.439
You see that people are able to record sound from most of the century.

41:02.459 --> 41:05.942
But we change very often the way of record sounds.

41:06.903 --> 41:20.457
And if you want to hear one old recording, you must have to move the old record

41:20.842 --> 41:23.826
the new compact disc or anything.

41:24.667 --> 41:28.332
So it's the same problem with digitization.

41:29.333 --> 41:32.097
The techniques are every year moving.

41:33.178 --> 41:48.739
So we cannot pretend, we cannot say today that we are sure that the technical support we use to record digitized documents

41:49.141 --> 41:50.923
will be the same in 10 years.

41:51.483 --> 42:01.352
We cannot pretend that the machine used to read these digitized records will be the same in 10 years.

42:01.372 --> 42:12.942
And we cannot absolutely pretend that this kind of records will be used in 25 or 30 years.

42:15.724 --> 42:18.827
Yes, and there is another problem.

42:19.263 --> 42:25.871
digitized bits are sometimes disappearing.

42:27.614 --> 42:32.360
It's a question of signal.

42:32.380 --> 42:37.847
You know, digitized things is something like that.

42:39.509 --> 42:42.072
It's binary code.

42:42.092 --> 42:47.599
And with time, on some support, it becomes like that.

42:47.798 --> 43:02.191
When we stored the first digitized record and DAT tapes, it was very good support for material for one, two, three years.

43:02.892 --> 43:16.945
But to keep the digital material clear, we are obliged to move from DAT tape to

43:18.798 --> 43:20.100
optical disk.

43:22.383 --> 43:30.655
But the way to read this disk is not, we are not sure that it will be the same in five years.

43:31.195 --> 43:45.295
So if you want to be sure to read information coming from computers, you are almost obliged to keep samples of machines

43:46.709 --> 44:14.488
okay let's see it's not it's no more library it's a museum of technical so that's a very cool oh that's fascinating yeah is does this concern you though um in some instances in the united states there there are examples of where they are making digitized copies of some materials and then deaccessioning getting rid of

44:14.823 --> 44:15.904
the printed material.

44:16.104 --> 44:18.527
They don't have a printed backup.

44:18.547 --> 44:19.448
Does that concern you?

44:21.731 --> 44:24.233
No, not here.

44:24.814 --> 44:27.437
I mean not here, but does that philosophy concern you?

44:27.597 --> 44:28.558
Would that concern you?

44:29.419 --> 44:30.941
No, we don't.

44:33.243 --> 44:44.796
In conservation, the choice of the National Library is to keep the book or periodical or records

44:45.012 --> 44:55.241
sound records, and to keep also copies, but we keep photographic copies.

44:55.662 --> 44:57.863
We don't choose today.

44:58.004 --> 45:01.327
We don't choose the digitized copies.

45:01.347 --> 45:05.370
Digitized copies is for the public.

45:05.831 --> 45:06.852
It's for communication.

45:07.052 --> 45:08.533
It's not for conservation.

45:08.613 --> 45:09.954
It's not archival in your view.

45:10.054 --> 45:11.175
It's not archival today.

45:11.676 --> 45:12.977
Maybe in

45:13.615 --> 45:15.498
The year's coming, I don't know.

45:15.939 --> 45:17.020
But today it's not.

45:18.062 --> 45:24.451
We can't trust the digitized methods to conserve or to preserve material.

45:24.652 --> 45:37.111
It's not true only for libraries, but it's true for banks or insurance companies and military purposes and so on.

45:37.371 --> 45:41.277
I was told that in some private companies,

45:41.695 --> 45:48.563
people sought to preserve their data on digitized documents.

45:48.703 --> 45:58.174
But they are changing their mind because they see that, they saw that it's not sure.

45:59.115 --> 46:06.364
It's sure for five, ten years, five, six years, but it's not sure.

46:06.524 --> 46:08.366
And there is two problems.

46:08.486 --> 46:10.909
It's to keep the signal.

46:12.020 --> 46:17.946
And the other problem is to keep the machine able to read its free access.

46:17.966 --> 46:21.049
And it's technical problems.

46:21.109 --> 46:34.602
But the way to read, you have the angle of, you know that it's a laser with the digital.

46:35.063 --> 46:40.288
And the angle of laser is not the same in every machine.

46:40.994 --> 46:47.604
the speed of rotation of the compact disc is not the same, and so on.

46:48.084 --> 46:55.255
So it means that there is not a standard way of reading digitized, my say.

46:55.916 --> 47:03.467
There is a lot of ways, and industry is working about standards, and it's a big interest.

47:03.927 --> 47:09.195
But we feel that we are now in...

47:09.968 --> 47:13.311
years of creating new techniques.

47:13.331 --> 47:19.077
And this movement is not fixed, it's not seizing.

47:19.657 --> 47:29.026
We have inventions, new machines, new technology coming every year, every six months.

47:29.927 --> 47:38.355
So you cannot trust this technology moving every time to preserve something.

47:38.690 --> 47:46.320
To preserve something, you need something permanent, like book or like photography.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.302
See, we know how long paper lasts.

47:48.322 --> 47:49.343
It lasts a long time.

47:49.363 --> 47:50.144
We know, yes.

47:50.365 --> 47:52.267
We know very, very well.

47:52.347 --> 47:54.289
It was very well studied.

47:55.010 --> 48:07.566
We know that all paper made from textile is a very good document,

48:07.900 --> 48:15.069
The old wood of the 15th century are in very good state.

48:17.132 --> 48:33.033
Paper was manufactured from the 19th century from wood, and then it became something less durable.

48:33.093 --> 48:33.874
We call it pulp.

48:34.428 --> 48:40.939
Yes, and we have this problem like in American libraries.

48:42.341 --> 48:52.978
And we create some machines specialized to keep out the acid from pulp paper.

48:54.160 --> 49:00.250
But we trust in Argentine photography.

49:00.533 --> 49:05.960
It seems to last at least one century.

49:07.041 --> 49:08.563
I'm sorry, microfilm?

49:08.704 --> 49:10.005
Microfilm, yes.

49:10.025 --> 49:20.118
That little illustration that you drew with the wavy line, what do you call that condition where some of the digitized data tends to disappear?

49:20.138 --> 49:21.360
Do you have a name for that?

49:22.100 --> 49:25.264
In French, but I am not sure of my English.

49:25.284 --> 49:26.625
Well, can you tell me the French word?

49:27.226 --> 49:28.788
It's a signal.

49:29.709 --> 49:30.510
Could you write it down?

49:30.690 --> 49:33.153
Or maybe you could let me have that piece of paper, too, if you don't mind.

49:33.193 --> 49:36.897
It's a signal.

49:36.917 --> 49:45.848
It means when you have a sound or a light, it's a wave.

49:47.490 --> 49:50.453
And in digitally...

49:50.939 --> 49:54.824
documents, you have so one or zero.

49:55.986 --> 49:57.308
One, zero.

49:57.588 --> 50:06.821
So if you look at very carefully digital signals, it's that shape.

50:07.262 --> 50:12.489
But with time coming, it's disappearing.

50:12.589 --> 50:20.440
So in the chain, as you know, there is no meaning under seven

50:21.128 --> 50:50.106
bits okay so when you are hearing a record you know that in your compact discs they are made of this kind of digits if there is one was lacking there is no problem because human reconstruct

50:50.508 --> 50:53.372
the lacking signal.

50:54.033 --> 51:08.672
But when we are talking of very complicated business, I mean images or informations, it's not the same.

51:09.153 --> 51:20.228
So the new laser readers are able to reconstruct something with lacking.

51:20.984 --> 51:26.351
But not with any information, if you understand.

51:26.812 --> 51:27.453
I see.

51:28.294 --> 51:32.860
And you don't know what's causing the bits of information to disappear.

51:34.883 --> 51:35.904
Yes, we know.

51:36.024 --> 51:40.570
It's coming from the plastic or anything.

51:40.750 --> 51:44.335
It's only a matter of material.

51:44.776 --> 51:49.422
We have now an industry company building some...

51:50.262 --> 51:54.167
optical disk named century disk.

51:54.187 --> 52:06.262
And these century disks are able to last a century because they are with components very stable.

52:06.362 --> 52:10.608
I don't know the word in English, very permanent, stable, permanent.

52:11.409 --> 52:19.459
And the end of the disk, there is no plastic, there is only glass.

52:20.384 --> 52:34.220
And I know that the Library of Congress is looking at this kind of compact disk to keep a part of this digitized material.

52:35.422 --> 52:40.448
I think to the American Memory Program.

52:40.468 --> 52:43.571
And we are also looking at this kind.

52:43.671 --> 52:46.695
But this is the problem of the signal.

52:47.300 --> 52:50.423
you keep the machine problem.

52:51.944 --> 53:10.141
If you keep your data on this sensory disk, you have to keep a machine and to maintain that machine and to have industry able to give you pieces and so on.

53:10.161 --> 53:15.906
When you go back and you look at how much computerized information was stored on perforated cards,

53:16.544 --> 53:20.550
And now nobody has the machine to read the cards, so that's useless information.

53:20.730 --> 53:21.812
Right, right.

53:22.393 --> 53:23.574
It's the same situation.

53:23.654 --> 53:32.087
Yes, but most of companies don't need to keep a long time their data.

53:33.168 --> 53:37.995
In business, you don't have to keep your data for a long, long, long time.

53:38.696 --> 53:43.243
But in some companies, insurance...

53:44.506 --> 53:54.622
Everything was dealing with atomic energy, because as you know, radiation lasts for centuries.

53:55.444 --> 53:57.127
You must have to keep your letters.

53:58.609 --> 54:08.505
And these people must choose very carefully the way of conservation.

54:09.312 --> 54:10.534
Very, very interesting.

54:10.814 --> 54:14.860
So when do you believe that the book you're writing will be completed?

54:16.242 --> 54:20.529
My book, I wrote the chapter in French.

54:21.109 --> 54:35.691
I have some corrections to give, but I sent the chapter in French to my American colleague, and...

54:36.160 --> 54:40.488
I shall receive the English version about in August.

54:40.868 --> 54:46.217
I may send you a... What I'd like to do is I'd like to send you a copy of my book.

54:46.418 --> 54:51.847
Maybe we can make a... When are you going to write it?

54:51.988 --> 54:52.268
Now?

54:53.089 --> 54:56.295
I'm starting the writing now, and I will be submitting...

54:57.558 --> 55:03.264
the manuscript about a year from now, and we hope to have the book published in 1999.

55:03.725 --> 55:26.670
I may ask that you have written some articles in English with digitization, and this will be in English and more comfortable for you, because it has a lot of technical details, and I'm not able to use the right word

55:27.072 --> 55:28.033
at the right time.

55:28.754 --> 55:30.135
Yes, thank you.

55:30.255 --> 55:32.097
This is absolutely wonderful.

55:32.338 --> 55:39.545
You know, we're writing really, this book is dealing with libraries through history, but also libraries of the future.

55:39.605 --> 55:49.275
And when you were talking about how President Mitterrand wanted not only a great repository for the patrimony of France, but a symbol.

55:49.516 --> 55:53.620
I mean, this building makes a statement, doesn't it?

55:53.937 --> 55:56.079
It's more than a repository of knowledge.

55:56.140 --> 55:57.021
It makes a statement.

55:57.101 --> 55:57.882
Yes, yes, yes.

55:58.482 --> 56:00.765
And I think you were suggesting that earlier.

56:00.945 --> 56:01.466
Yes, yes.

56:01.646 --> 56:07.232
And in my chapter, you will have the statement of the president.

56:07.312 --> 56:08.994
I must have that.

56:09.014 --> 56:09.115
Okay.

56:09.135 --> 56:10.496
Do you have email, by the way?

56:10.937 --> 56:14.381
Yes, you have the email on the microphone.

56:15.121 --> 56:16.743
Do you like to use email, by the way?

56:17.584 --> 56:18.585
Yes, I like it.

56:18.606 --> 56:20.788
I do, too, yes.

56:21.646 --> 56:23.068
It's efficient.

56:23.168 --> 56:25.452
It's very efficient to send files.

56:27.194 --> 56:33.704
Not only to send a word, to say something, but to send files.

56:33.724 --> 56:38.010
When I published the article, it was in Japan.

56:38.231 --> 56:44.881
So I signed my paper by mail.

56:44.901 --> 56:51.130
It took only five or ten seconds to mail it.

56:52.190 --> 56:53.313
This is remarkable.

56:53.874 --> 56:57.824
And if you don't mind, do you have a phone number, or is it on the card, too?

56:57.884 --> 56:58.646
Yes, it's on the card.

56:58.666 --> 57:00.150
Do you mind my calling you at some point?

57:00.871 --> 57:02.335
Yes, you may.

57:02.939 --> 57:05.301
What I'll do is contact you by email.

57:05.421 --> 57:05.662
Yes.

57:05.882 --> 57:08.644
And this is an introductory trip for us.

57:09.045 --> 57:09.325
Yes.

57:09.525 --> 57:13.989
I think the most interesting for you is to see something.

57:14.370 --> 57:17.953
The most thing you can see is the most useful.

57:18.293 --> 57:18.574
I agree.

57:18.594 --> 57:27.762
And then you may arrange or have more explanations by mail or by exchanging publications.

57:27.782 --> 57:29.644
And I think perhaps a return visit, too.

57:29.904 --> 57:30.305
Yes.

57:30.465 --> 57:31.366
You are welcome.

57:31.786 --> 57:31.866
Yes.

57:33.787 --> 57:34.668
Did you have any yet?

57:35.629 --> 57:36.250
You explained everything.

57:36.270 --> 57:36.731
Everything?

57:36.831 --> 57:37.652
Excellent.

57:37.672 --> 57:37.832
Perfect.

57:37.852 --> 57:38.333
Very good.

57:39.114 --> 57:51.729
You have concerns about, I sense a concern in your part that you're not really fully secure in your mind about the digital future, so to speak.

57:51.789 --> 57:53.712
I mean, you have reservations.

57:53.732 --> 57:56.675
You seem to be a very cautious man in proceeding.

57:57.957 --> 57:59.158
I am a librarian.

57:59.178 --> 58:02.022
I'm not a curator.

58:02.339 --> 58:06.876
That's the reason why my... We didn't say that.

58:06.936 --> 58:08.121
That's very important to me.

58:08.141 --> 58:11.995
Could you give me briefly... I'll just turn this on the other side.
