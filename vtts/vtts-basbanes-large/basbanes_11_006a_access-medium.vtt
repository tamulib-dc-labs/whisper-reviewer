WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:31.438
So anyway, I agreed to come back on the commission to try to work us through the opening and spend basically a year on it, trying to get it established so that the dream that we had laid out, I think, for a great urban library would continue because we felt we had

00:32.060 --> 00:32.841
done a lot.

00:33.702 --> 00:37.105
You know, we've done two bond issues for the library.

00:37.145 --> 00:54.621
We did Prop E, which basically was a 30 percent increase, plus raising the 35 million, none of which, by the way, the Librarians Guild had not participated in anything like that, any of the elections at all, any of the fundraising.

00:58.264 --> 01:01.307
And so we wanted to see things get started, and then we started running into the trouble

01:01.658 --> 01:22.407
after the library opened, and the big battle over the MOU for private money coming in, because we wanted to launch a fundraising campaign around the branches, because we've got bond money that will allow us to do seismic upgrades, electrical upgrades, and access for the disabled.

01:23.248 --> 01:24.750
But you can't even paint the same place.

01:25.491 --> 01:27.013
You know, you can't put in new bookshelves.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.215
You can't buy new furniture.

01:28.516 --> 01:29.577
You can't use city money for this.

01:29.597 --> 01:30.298
It's all private money.

01:30.650 --> 01:39.883
So we wanted to do a campaign around that, but the MOU fight basically knocked that in the head, and we've not been able to do that.

01:39.903 --> 01:46.653
We've been in sort of a hold position on trying to keep our donors from abandoning us long-term.

01:47.554 --> 01:58.530
The foundation is only a shell of what it was before, and we had, you know, at that point in time, the most successful fundraising campaign in a publicly-run library.

01:58.983 --> 01:59.664
in the country.

02:00.044 --> 02:02.647
So just briefly, you mentioned that you're from Nevada.

02:02.667 --> 02:03.789
You're a state rep there.

02:03.829 --> 02:09.796
How long have you, if you can just give me a very brief biographical, how long did you come to San Francisco?

02:10.036 --> 02:13.760
I spent four terms as a Nevada State Assemblyman representing Reno.

02:15.162 --> 02:19.948
And then I came here in 81.

02:21.249 --> 02:25.334
I worked for Pacific Telephone at that time.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.977
I've been here since then, yeah.

02:28.632 --> 02:30.314
And how old are you, am I telling you that?

02:30.334 --> 02:30.494
I'm 50.

02:32.697 --> 02:33.638
Just turned 50.

02:33.658 --> 02:34.499
Yeah, I'm good.

02:34.819 --> 02:36.862
I'm 54.

02:36.882 --> 02:39.525
Everybody who's younger than me is a kid, as far as I'm concerned.

02:39.545 --> 02:40.085
I can't really.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.149
And the library has been a passion.

02:43.189 --> 02:47.094
I get involved in a lot of charitable work within the city.

02:47.694 --> 02:55.163
I'm involved with the Names Project on a big fundraiser we're doing in late October.

02:55.183 --> 02:58.487
I've got a Project Inform, which is an AIDS database program.

02:58.906 --> 03:00.108
and helping raise money for.

03:00.148 --> 03:01.890
I got an event at Cartier on Friday.

03:02.731 --> 03:07.678
I just came off the Open Hand Board, which is a food program for people with AIDS.

03:07.698 --> 03:13.365
It was on private industry council for job training for the disadvantaged, basically.

03:13.406 --> 03:14.527
I was on that for 10 years.

03:15.649 --> 03:23.159
And I do a lot of... I donate a lot.

03:23.179 --> 03:27.004
Plus, I oversee a lot of the corporations' donation programs.

03:27.024 --> 03:28.626
That's why you see a lot of money coming in.

03:29.247 --> 03:32.751
Pacific Bill underwrote the grand opening of the library.

03:32.771 --> 03:34.894
And how much did Pacific Bill give to the libraries?

03:34.954 --> 03:37.277
Are these public figures, or they don't say anything?

03:39.039 --> 03:39.620
Not really.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.603
We've given several hundred thousand dollars.

03:42.103 --> 03:42.744
That's not a lot.

03:43.585 --> 03:44.987
In the grand scheme of things, it's not.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.068
Not in the grand scheme of things.

03:46.669 --> 03:49.793
But in some cases... It's not like you own the public library, is what I'm saying?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.536
No, it's not like we own the library at all.

03:52.576 --> 03:54.579
I mean, the big donors are the private donors.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.301
It's the Swigs and

03:56.821 --> 03:59.385
And it's not in the millions is what you're telling me.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.167
No, it's not in the millions at all.

04:01.187 --> 04:05.554
We set the, we were having a hard time selling for the opening of the library.

04:05.954 --> 04:22.879
We were trying to get corporate underwriting, and I needed, they'd set a level, and I basically went to the chairman and said, I think we ought to be the underwriter and what have you, and, and he said, okay, and so I was able to go back then to the foundation and say, okay,

04:23.197 --> 04:25.040
We have set the dollar amount.

04:25.260 --> 04:28.224
Now you can go to Bank of America and Levi's and everybody.

04:28.444 --> 04:30.107
We have set the threshold of dollars.

04:30.587 --> 04:32.109
I tried to do that whenever I could.

04:32.570 --> 04:36.035
And that's why you see our name on some of the flags that are still around the city.

04:36.476 --> 04:42.304
Pacific Bell's name at the bottom.

04:44.267 --> 04:50.335
We've had, I mean, I've had corporate donations, for example, the Chevron Team Center,

04:50.534 --> 05:00.063
the Bank of America, Jobs and Career Center, Pacific Bell Foundation underwriting the Children's Electronic Discovery Center.

05:01.465 --> 05:05.449
Those are the three corporate names that are somewhat prominent, although in small signs.

05:06.009 --> 05:07.511
They've been attacked repeatedly.

05:08.692 --> 05:12.796
And some of the union activists are those that are among the most vociferous.

05:13.797 --> 05:19.022
And I sort of look at it and say, you know, we talked Bank of America into giving us

05:19.323 --> 05:20.825
several hundred thousand dollars.

05:20.885 --> 05:31.883
I personally went on the sale of that to the chairman of Bank of America with Charlotte Swig, and we pitched him, and he agreed to give us several hundred thousand dollars.

05:32.404 --> 05:42.580
Did not have any particular interest in what the naming opportunity was, but we gave the same set of lists we did to any donor, and they said, well, we're really interested in

05:42.863 --> 05:49.310
In jobs and careers, you're going to have basically sets of information called the Jobs and Career Center.

05:49.470 --> 05:50.911
We'll take that.

05:51.212 --> 05:54.435
Chevron, we also convinced to give us several hundred thousand dollars.

05:55.716 --> 05:57.838
They had no particular interest in one thing or another.

05:58.139 --> 06:03.164
They looked at the list after they agreed to give us the money and said, we like this idea of a teen center.

06:03.184 --> 06:09.110
You've never done anything in the library before aimed specifically at materials aimed at teenagers.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.291
We think that's cool.

06:11.012 --> 06:11.993
And so we'll put our name on that.

06:12.749 --> 06:31.519
And they have been vilified repeatedly at public hearings by the same clique that you have been talking to, that that is somehow evil, that that is corporate America coming in and using the library for free advertising.

06:31.539 --> 06:36.968
And, I mean, the reality is Bank of America would get a whole lot more advertising hit

06:37.184 --> 06:45.097
out of buying a couple of TV commercials, and they're going to get out of putting their name over and type this big on the ceiling.

06:45.117 --> 06:47.421
I mean, New York probably, there's the Bill Blass room.

06:47.601 --> 06:47.982
See, you know.

06:48.122 --> 06:55.034
Is that... Well, I told you that Jim Hormel was the, you know, the... And he gave 10 million.

06:55.054 --> 06:56.456
Bill Blass, yeah.

06:56.476 --> 07:00.222
Yeah, that's not... No, and it's sort of a, so what?

07:00.883 --> 07:01.745
I mean, that's where I come.

07:01.825 --> 07:03.748
I think we've kept it to a minimum.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.972
I can't get every nickel.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.013
Well, what do I say?

07:07.073 --> 07:12.618
But, I mean, if somebody's willing to give you $10 million, you take for $10 million, and you do something good with it.

07:12.638 --> 07:12.758
Yeah.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.580
I mean, that's, you and I are from the same school on raising money.

07:16.501 --> 07:17.582
But they've heard our fundraising.

07:17.802 --> 07:20.745
So, and it's going to be tough going forward.

07:20.905 --> 07:22.206
I mean, there are other people who are really great.

07:22.226 --> 07:28.972
I mean, I don't know how much you want to get into this, but like Kathy or Sherry Thomas that I mentioned is, you know, head of the foundation.

07:29.012 --> 07:33.516
Martin Paley, who's a wonderful man, who heads the Center for the Common Good over in Berkeley.

07:33.968 --> 07:38.635
He was our first executive director of the foundation, picked by Charlotte Millswig.

07:39.456 --> 07:43.261
He headed the San Francisco Foundation for a number of years, but he was our first big fundraiser.

07:43.502 --> 07:50.451
He's the one, he took some of the ideas on the Gay and Lesbian Center and the minority groups and really came up with the Affinity Group program.

07:51.092 --> 07:53.215
He looked at that as a fundraising opportunity.

07:53.636 --> 08:00.766
I was only looking conceptually at taking our collections out and in communities of interest within the city.

08:00.826 --> 08:02.929
I'd taken it, I did a plan, a paper on that.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.012
and the Gay and Lesbian Center.

08:05.313 --> 08:10.400
And he said, because when we started raising money for the Gay and Lesbian Center, we obviously had a runaway success.

08:10.921 --> 08:15.308
So he then put together, per se, the Affinity Group program around these different collections.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.071
And where did that name, Affinity Group, come from?

08:17.391 --> 08:17.952
They made it up.

08:18.573 --> 08:21.958
I mean, it was people who had a particular affinity of interest.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.366
We did it with, you know, children as well as minority groups, gays and lesbians, and permanents.

08:29.470 --> 08:30.992
People of this particular affinity.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.280
whatever the affinity might be.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.463
So it was a new one.

08:35.483 --> 08:37.626
Listen, we've been going at this for over two hours.

08:38.247 --> 08:39.609
I'm glad we had the opportunity.

08:39.629 --> 08:42.393
I hope you see there is another side to this thing.

08:42.513 --> 08:46.138
I told you I want to explore fully both sides.

08:46.238 --> 08:48.401
When I get back, we'll transcribe these tapes.

08:51.205 --> 08:52.948
But I do have hard feelings on some of these folks.

08:52.968 --> 08:54.510
They have very hard feelings on me.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.072
It's pretty obvious.

08:56.393 --> 09:00.118
There's no question about it.

09:00.419 --> 09:01.160
What do I say?

09:01.440 --> 09:02.441
Huh?

09:02.461 --> 09:03.423
I mean, I don't get paid.

09:03.463 --> 09:05.425
You know, it's by the library.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.248
How long do you plan to do this, by the way?

09:08.268 --> 09:10.411
Oh, this is my last year as president of the commission.

09:10.631 --> 09:11.192
That's my question, yeah.

09:11.212 --> 09:15.337
I've told the commission that I will not serve another year as president.

09:15.357 --> 09:20.603
My term runs to 1999, whether I'll stick around that long.

09:20.623 --> 09:25.569
I want to see a permanent librarian in place who is really strong.

09:26.410 --> 09:30.375
I would love to see most of the problem areas fixed.

09:31.486 --> 09:44.479
and the library is on a roll again, you know, and obviously headed towards success, that our private fundraising and our role within the community is reestablished.

09:44.859 --> 09:47.682
I want to see the affinity groups really take off.

09:49.544 --> 10:01.375
The Gay and Lesbian Center is my personal idea, and I want to see it en route to becoming, you know, an international institution in its own right, someday maybe with its own building.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.992
just like Schomburg's got sitting in Harlem.

10:04.954 --> 10:07.977
I think that's perfectly doable.

10:08.318 --> 10:16.048
Staff laughed at me the first time we chatted about this fundraising privately and the senior staff, Ken's direct reports.

10:16.648 --> 10:18.651
Early on, it was like 88, 89.

10:19.432 --> 10:29.164
And I said, well, this Gay Center, I said, within 10 years of its establishment, it will have more money as an endowment than you have in your annual budget.

10:29.184 --> 10:30.225
And they all laughed like hell.

10:30.866 --> 10:31.547
And nobody laughs at me.

10:32.017 --> 10:36.302
You start looking at the number of wills that we are written into.

10:37.583 --> 10:50.058
Some of the money that's already come in, what one guy gave us, an apartment house, you know, divided up between the gay and lesbian center at the library and I think Reckon Park or something like that.

10:50.178 --> 10:52.160
And that was several hundred thousand dollars.

10:52.180 --> 10:55.724
You know, that's starting to come in now over time.

10:56.145 --> 10:59.188
But we have a contract that we need to meet as far as I'm concerned.

10:59.557 --> 11:06.805
And that is really creating an extraordinary service that has never existed before in the United States.

11:08.086 --> 11:14.493
A gay and lesbian archive that anyone can walk in off the street and have access to.

11:14.513 --> 11:17.236
Not like you've got to go, what did you say, Cornell, I think?

11:17.717 --> 11:19.679
Yeah, a marvelous collection.

11:19.719 --> 11:20.239
A marvelous collection.

11:20.299 --> 11:24.464
They don't call it gay and lesbian, but they call it something.

11:24.724 --> 11:28.348
And it was a very wealthy gay man who was basically

11:28.835 --> 11:37.287
his own extraordinary personal collection, but also funded to grow, and it's curated, and it's, you know... We've got the Randy Schultz collection.

11:38.309 --> 11:51.788
One of the mayor's speechwriters said he was a friend of Randy Schultz, so he set up dinner, and I, it was just down the street, I hauled all of my charts that dealt with the library and stuff we were trying to do at the Gay and Lesbian Center, and over dinner, I went through all the stuff, and he ended it.

11:52.248 --> 11:57.736
Dinner, Randy, this was probably a year before he died, said, uh... I gave you everything I got.

11:57.756 --> 11:58.217
Yeah, that's great.

11:58.450 --> 12:02.775
I think it's called the Human Sexuality Collection.

12:02.795 --> 12:06.099
We've got a couple of filmmakers, sets of stuff.

12:06.719 --> 12:25.060
Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California has come in with their entire collection, and a guy donated money for the Historical Society to hire a staff person to manage their materials and catalog it in a way that will be useful to the library.

12:25.641 --> 12:26.662
Everything is not done.

12:26.682 --> 12:28.204
We're still in our infancy.

12:28.792 --> 12:35.181
But we have done the beginning work to create, you know, a gay chamber.

12:35.201 --> 12:56.851
And I want to see that happen because I see that as something that would be really important to my community long term, creating an intellectual resource and looking at how it can tie together as a point of bringing together maybe gay and lesbian study departments at colleges around the country.

12:57.572 --> 12:58.613
Certainly the gay and lesbian

12:59.048 --> 13:06.339
study group at San Francisco State, and some of their people were very involved in some of our discussions.

13:06.359 --> 13:08.463
Did Hormel and Ginsberg stuff get out of Stanford?

13:08.503 --> 13:09.484
They went to Stanford, yeah.

13:10.085 --> 13:10.826
We couldn't compete.

13:10.846 --> 13:12.008
They were looking for a million bucks.

13:12.028 --> 13:14.392
A million bucks, and they'd been in discussions for a long time.

13:14.412 --> 13:15.754
Would have loved to have seen it come here.

13:16.335 --> 13:23.346
We are in, you know, the Foundation has just appointed its Hormel Advisory Committee.

13:23.366 --> 13:25.309
The letter I just sent to Gina today

13:25.677 --> 13:29.541
said, we need to figure out what we're going to do on our side to match that.

13:31.463 --> 13:33.004
How do we interface with that?

13:33.024 --> 13:34.866
I've asked Gina, and she's agreed.

13:34.906 --> 13:46.998
She's going to do a series of meetings between the affinity group leaders and Gina and the staff in the library up and down the ranks that deals with that collection.

13:48.500 --> 13:55.667
So maybe in some cases be the same people because a lot of it is considered part of the way they're organized now under special collections.

13:56.643 --> 13:58.365
Over time, I think that should change.

13:59.207 --> 14:14.308
But I want a dialogue between, you know, the chief of the main library, the head of special collections, the person who's assigned to work with a particular affinity group, a couple of librarians that stock books in there, the pages that stock books in there.

14:14.608 --> 14:18.834
I want to get them all together in the same room, and I want them all just to talk.

14:18.854 --> 14:25.283
I think that will go miles towards getting over what some people claim is a fear

14:25.533 --> 14:27.996
that outside people are going to come in and tell them what to do.

14:28.296 --> 14:31.699
And the affinity groups have not said they're going to tell anybody what to do, but they would like to be listened to.

14:33.301 --> 14:44.493
We've had, and some of the stuff, we're going from an attitude of scarcity, which is both in information as well as money, where librarians figure, well, we have no money.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.215
We couldn't manage that.

14:46.235 --> 14:47.996
You know, so they've turned down collections.

14:48.677 --> 14:51.080
And we've come back and say, why would you turn that down?

14:51.440 --> 14:52.401
We'll raise the money.

14:52.853 --> 14:53.734
privately to do that.

14:53.914 --> 14:56.718
But then you also have that money to maintain it, to curate it.

14:56.858 --> 14:57.158
Maintain it.

14:57.178 --> 14:59.181
Well Gay and Lesbian Center is going to be your example.

14:59.882 --> 15:03.506
We had a $1.6 million goal, and we raised over $3 million.

15:04.127 --> 15:05.989
So it's endowed, one hopes.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.794
The endowment has started, but we hadn't decided what to do with it.

15:09.814 --> 15:10.715
The money is sort of sitting there.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.878
The library didn't even know how to ask us for money.

15:12.898 --> 15:15.040
They didn't know what to ask us for on that.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.683
And we didn't have the process set up.

15:16.963 --> 15:19.085
The process is now in place.

15:19.326 --> 15:21.949
I tried to set up an advisory group program with the library

15:22.267 --> 15:24.850
I don't know, six years ago or so.

15:25.251 --> 15:26.652
Because we do it in the company.

15:27.233 --> 15:28.935
That's part of what I do here within the company.

15:28.955 --> 15:30.197
I think it works wonderfully.

15:30.217 --> 15:30.777
Sit down with people.

15:30.797 --> 15:35.603
I think Wednesday when I go in there, I'll have to take the electrical and make it a point to really see the gate.

15:35.623 --> 15:38.867
Yeah, do that.

15:38.927 --> 15:40.829
See what they're doing.

15:40.849 --> 15:43.352
Listen, I've got a 7 o'clock.

15:44.614 --> 15:45.695
You know, I've enjoyed it.

15:46.256 --> 15:51.362
Allow me the option to call you at some point.

15:51.764 --> 15:53.247
follow up in anything.

15:53.567 --> 15:56.433
I mean, I'm not going to play ping pong either.

15:56.513 --> 15:58.256
No, I mean, there's no point in it.

15:58.276 --> 15:59.959
There are different points of view.

16:00.019 --> 16:04.628
Yeah, and really, people want me to look at tons of shit, you know.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.972
I mean, there's only so much stuff you can...
