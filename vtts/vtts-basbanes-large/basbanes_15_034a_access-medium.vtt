00:02.360 --> 00:05.063
What is the battery in there?

00:05.083 --> 00:05.523
It's fine.

00:05.543 --> 00:06.244
It's in a machine.

00:06.424 --> 00:09.467
Dr. Peter Abrahams, and that's right there.

00:09.687 --> 00:11.849
Congratulations on your new book.

00:11.889 --> 00:13.190
Well, thank you very much.

00:13.390 --> 00:16.954
Tell me, I mean, for my purposes, this is perfect.

00:17.414 --> 00:19.336
I'm a big baseball fan.

00:19.536 --> 00:21.438
We're probably not going to have baseball this year.

00:21.658 --> 00:22.379
It looks that way.

00:22.419 --> 00:28.044
You afford me the opportunity to write an interesting piece for the first week of April.

00:28.285 --> 00:29.426
About baseball.

00:29.666 --> 00:31.928
About baseball, but also...

00:32.279 --> 00:34.722
Are there any number of possibilities with this?

00:35.263 --> 00:35.864
Certainly.

00:36.865 --> 00:40.350
Tell me a little bit about the concept of this book.

00:40.410 --> 00:43.094
I mean, it's certainly not just a baseball book.

00:43.114 --> 00:44.996
It's about madness and obsession.

00:46.819 --> 00:53.708
You know, Susan was asking me what the genesis of it was, how I began.

00:55.871 --> 00:58.675
You know, when I started to think about this, it was at Fenway Park.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.754
Do you mind if I shoot a couple?

01:00.774 --> 01:01.334
No, that's all right.

01:02.155 --> 01:03.577
Susan, didn't she send you anything?

01:03.677 --> 01:06.960
Yeah, but I have some customers that say color, so... Oh, okay.

01:06.980 --> 01:07.181
All right.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.202
We offer that.

01:08.222 --> 01:09.002
Okay.

01:09.022 --> 01:10.584
All right.

01:10.604 --> 01:23.117
Well, Susan said, I mean, I was at Fenway Park a few years ago with my brother, and I think we had two of my boys.

01:23.177 --> 01:25.860
My two sons were there, too, I think.

01:26.380 --> 01:30.548
This was the year when the Red Sox were very competitive, I think, at least at that part of the season.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.890
And the Blue Jays were in town.

01:31.930 --> 01:34.655
And my brother is a big Blue Jays fan.

01:34.675 --> 01:35.337
He doesn't live here.

01:35.357 --> 01:36.619
He lives in Los Angeles.

01:36.639 --> 01:37.801
And he's a big Blue Jays fan.

01:37.821 --> 01:41.628
And so he was cheering for the Blue Jays at Fenway Park.

01:41.648 --> 01:49.022
And these two Red Sox, young male fans, began jeering him.

01:49.042 --> 01:49.603
And they went.

01:50.377 --> 01:58.266
It became much more than just like... Against my brother, who was... It became much more than... Okay, they had plenty to drink.

01:58.686 --> 02:06.335
And it became much more... You know when suddenly you look at someone and you see it all in a new light and it can be quite scary?

02:06.775 --> 02:15.885
I looked at their faces and I thought, my God, if we weren't at the ballpark, this would be... These guys are dangerous, almost.

02:16.185 --> 02:19.489
And the image of them has stayed with me.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.816
you know, these two guys.

02:21.836 --> 02:27.441
I don't think my brother saw it this way particularly, but I did, and it began to stay with me.

02:27.461 --> 02:47.619
I began to get the idea of some fan who, I mean, I was thinking about how people, me too, I mean, have, you know, follow sports, has a lot of genuine emotion invested in what obviously turns out to be the business of baseball.

02:47.679 --> 02:49.020
You know, it's like,

02:49.760 --> 02:53.385
I have no emotion invested in how General Motors is doing.

02:53.885 --> 02:56.789
If the car dealer has a good week, I couldn't care less.

02:57.169 --> 03:01.875
Whereas if the Red Sox are, you know, I do have genuine emotion invested in something where maybe you shouldn't.

03:02.616 --> 03:13.289
And then when I look at people like this, I mean, these two fans who, you know, were in a mental state about her.

03:14.010 --> 03:17.134
Did you see instantly the germ of a novel?

03:17.688 --> 03:20.812
No, oh no, I didn't... No, no.

03:21.613 --> 03:23.476
I don't... It doesn't work that way for me.

03:23.556 --> 03:34.291
I get maybe three or four ideas a year that I think could be a novel, but I don't... When the idea comes, I just... I don't do anything with it.

03:34.812 --> 03:40.760
I wait to see if it keeps coming back and kind of grows on its own for a while before I actually engage with it.

03:42.122 --> 03:46.007
To make... I mean, this is just my MO, that...

03:47.759 --> 03:55.106
and maybe it's even superstition in some ways, that if it's strong enough to keep knocking at my door, then there's something there.

03:55.286 --> 04:05.615
If I have to, in the early stages, go get it, you know, and cudgel my brain, then it isn't going to be big enough, and I just wait for another one.

04:05.635 --> 04:08.377
Now, this is, I think, your eighth movie, is that right?

04:09.078 --> 04:09.438
Yes.

04:09.579 --> 04:13.042
Fifteen years, which is pretty productive.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.724
That's what my grandmother says, but I really think I'm slow.

04:16.379 --> 04:17.020
I really do."

04:17.040 --> 04:20.063
And she said, oh, Peter, you're doing it.

04:20.083 --> 04:20.824
But I think that's great.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.848
You just had a book last year that was shortlisted for the Edgar Award, I think.

04:24.868 --> 04:26.249
Yeah, Lights Out.

04:26.490 --> 04:27.611
We'll find out in April.

04:27.731 --> 04:30.233
And here you are, 95.

04:30.454 --> 04:34.618
It was actually ready in 94.

04:34.638 --> 04:36.940
So, I mean, how long did it take to your write one?

04:37.561 --> 04:38.842
It's longer and longer.

04:39.543 --> 04:43.247
The actual writing of this, I'm not going back to when I had

04:43.430 --> 04:44.871
the idea and when it kind of grew.

04:44.891 --> 04:48.935
But the actual writing, I think, took about eight months.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.037
Now, of course, the house was in its worst.

04:52.858 --> 04:55.981
We moved in during that period.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.102
How long have you been here?

04:57.803 --> 04:59.444
How long has the house been under construction?

04:59.724 --> 05:04.949
Well, we... This is not on my page, but... No, we moved in last... Okay, we had problems.

05:05.349 --> 05:09.213
We moved in last December, and we had problems with our building.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.374
Not the builder who was doing the garage.

05:10.434 --> 05:13.116
He's been fabulous, and he's even ahead of schedule.

05:13.518 --> 05:15.361
But the builder was doing the house.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.825
I don't know what happened.

05:18.845 --> 05:20.307
I think he has to do something with his wife.

05:21.769 --> 05:29.139
And he lost a kind of interest and didn't come like for months at a time when we had to be in here.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.424
Or his workers would show up for a day or two and then they'd be gone.

05:33.325 --> 05:36.449
It was one of these Cape building stories you hear about.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.053
We had thought we had done everything possible to avoid.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.994
Were you living in the cave prior to this?

05:41.014 --> 05:41.114
Yeah.

05:41.254 --> 05:41.555
Oh, yeah.

05:41.735 --> 05:43.117
We've lived here since 1982.

05:43.397 --> 05:43.978
Oh.

05:43.998 --> 05:44.499
Yeah.

05:44.519 --> 05:45.020
In Woods Hole.

05:45.060 --> 05:46.241
We were in Woods Hole before.

05:47.844 --> 05:48.004
Really?

05:48.024 --> 05:48.184
Yeah.

05:48.284 --> 05:50.527
We were just going to interview Robert Ballard in a couple weeks.

05:50.607 --> 05:53.071
He has a book coming out.

05:53.091 --> 05:53.271
Uh-huh.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.693
I've never even met him.

05:54.713 --> 05:55.234
I know he is.

05:55.274 --> 05:57.116
The book looks good.

05:58.238 --> 05:58.358
Yeah.

05:58.378 --> 06:00.761
If you don't mind jumping around a little bit here.

06:00.781 --> 06:01.422
No.

06:01.643 --> 06:02.324
You're a boss.

06:02.744 --> 06:06.289
You might just give me a little bit of a biographical background.

06:06.623 --> 06:07.905
Well, I was born in Boston.

06:08.065 --> 06:09.647
Brookline, to be precise.

06:10.227 --> 06:18.757
And my father and my mother met at the Naval Hospital during the war.

06:18.817 --> 06:20.039
She was from Ottawa, Canada.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.322
Which Naval Hospital?

06:22.342 --> 06:22.782
In Boston.

06:22.802 --> 06:23.583
I'm not sure which one.

06:23.603 --> 06:24.724
I can call my father.

06:24.744 --> 06:24.965
No, no, no.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.647
It's in Boston.

06:26.667 --> 06:26.867
Yeah.

06:26.907 --> 06:27.828
Boston Naval Hospital.

06:28.128 --> 06:33.795
Well, I mean, was some VA... I'm not sure because... See, my mother's Uncle Jack from Milton.

06:34.518 --> 06:41.569
was the commanding officer of a cruiser that was sunk in the Battle of the Coral Sea.

06:42.230 --> 06:46.356
And he's one of these horrible stories with sharks, and he was in the water for 14 hours.

06:46.756 --> 06:48.359
And so he was in... He made it.

06:48.579 --> 06:52.004
Yeah, he made it, and he was recovering in the hospital.

06:52.124 --> 06:53.547
As soon as the Naval Hospital.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.288
There is a Naval Hospital.

06:54.308 --> 06:56.811
Yeah, with other Naval guys.

06:56.832 --> 07:02.500
And he shared a room with my father, who was a 20-year-old...

07:03.374 --> 07:05.357
Had he even graduated from college?

07:05.397 --> 07:06.198
He was at Williams.

07:06.258 --> 07:11.706
I think he had... He was 20 years old and he was commanding a sub-chaser in the Atlantic.

07:11.726 --> 07:14.370
He was only a lieutenant junior grade, but that's what happened in Orbe.

07:14.690 --> 07:15.371
It was unbelievable.

07:15.391 --> 07:20.618
At his age, I couldn't get up out of bed in the morning and get to class a long time, and he was doing that.

07:20.879 --> 07:25.045
Anyway, he was in the hospital, too, with a very bad case of athlete's foot.

07:25.545 --> 07:30.452
With my Uncle Jack, this war hero, and my dad with athlete's foot sharing a room.

07:30.513 --> 07:32.115
I spent a few years in the Navy.

07:32.315 --> 07:32.776
Oh, did you?

07:32.816 --> 07:32.976
Yeah.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.602
Were you in the Vietnam War?

07:37.045 --> 07:38.006
Vietnam.

07:38.246 --> 07:43.973
I was in Lieutenant J.G., which is... So nothing's changed, right?

07:43.993 --> 07:44.854
Nothing's changed.

07:45.635 --> 07:47.557
So my mom came down to visit my Uncle Jack.

07:48.618 --> 07:50.621
And that's how they met.

07:51.742 --> 07:58.390
And in fact, they honeymooned at the Cape Cod Hotel, which is now... Do you know where that is?

07:58.430 --> 07:59.291
It's very close to here.

07:59.311 --> 08:00.853
It's just around the corner on Syphilissa.

08:01.424 --> 08:03.146
And that's where... Do you still wear it?

08:03.547 --> 08:03.847
No.

08:04.428 --> 08:06.791
Oh, and people tried to say it was a lovely old place.

08:06.831 --> 08:09.314
And there are condos there now.

08:09.334 --> 08:10.615
Yeah, it turned into a whole condo thing.

08:10.635 --> 08:11.516
They tore it down.

08:11.857 --> 08:15.241
You know, we used to go for drinks and watch the sunset.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.663
A real cape-y thing.

08:18.164 --> 08:18.905
But it's condo.

08:18.945 --> 08:23.651
I mean, this, during all the condo-ization, it went down here a few years ago.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.655
And of course, now they're everywhere, and people have lost their shirts.

08:26.715 --> 08:27.656
I mean, it's one of those things.

08:28.357 --> 08:31.060
So I was born in Boston, but...

08:32.137 --> 08:39.567
My father, after the war, went to dental school at McGill University in Montreal.

08:41.109 --> 08:42.832
And they moved to Ottawa.

08:42.912 --> 08:45.155
So I grew up partly in Ottawa.

08:45.776 --> 08:49.922
And then they got divorced and my mother moved to the Bahamas.

08:51.844 --> 08:54.468
So I spent a lot of time there too.

08:55.670 --> 09:01.738
I went to Williams College in Massachusetts as he did.

09:01.938 --> 09:02.900
I graduated in 68.

09:04.824 --> 09:15.825
And a very unfortunate thing happened during, in my freshman year, they made a big rule change and made classroom attendance no longer compulsory.

09:15.845 --> 09:19.372
And for someone like me, that was just the worst thing that could have happened.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.195
So I really didn't know that.

09:22.137 --> 09:23.078
But you graduated?

09:23.219 --> 09:24.220
But I did graduate.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.783
I'm not sure it was the best thing that I did graduate.

09:26.824 --> 09:27.765
What was your major?

09:27.785 --> 09:28.065
English.

09:28.145 --> 09:30.889
But I was a really horrible student.

09:30.909 --> 09:37.398
Until the very end, in senior year, I started getting interested in art history and took a lot of art history courses, which I really enjoyed.

09:37.418 --> 09:42.185
And I went to class, and of course, that just, like magic, improves your grades.

09:42.546 --> 09:47.212
You know, just being there, you know.

09:47.292 --> 09:48.634
Let's see, what else?

09:51.044 --> 09:54.609
In the Bahamas, I got into scuba diving and freediving.

09:55.110 --> 09:59.076
And I used to work as a summer job as a spear fisherman down there.

10:00.018 --> 10:03.443
And so after I got out of college, I had no idea what I wanted to do.

10:03.483 --> 10:09.612
I kept doing spearing fish for a living.

10:09.632 --> 10:10.414
You made a living at this?

10:11.175 --> 10:12.196
Well, of a kind.

10:12.216 --> 10:13.298
I mean, you didn't need much money.

10:13.358 --> 10:17.845
And we'd go to a hotel if my brother was down there, and if not, I'd do it.

10:18.652 --> 10:33.189
We'd say, if you give me a place to live, like on a houseboat or just a little cabin, I'll supply all the fish you need for 50 cents a pound, some really low price.

10:33.209 --> 10:35.973
It was just an excuse to spearfish.

10:35.993 --> 10:42.881
I mean, there's some incredible diving down there in Poms.

10:43.341 --> 10:47.967
And we did it free diving, which is a very good sport.

10:48.453 --> 10:50.696
more fair from a fish's point of view.

10:50.716 --> 10:51.478
How long were you down there?

10:52.439 --> 10:54.342
Oh, off and on for a number of years.

10:55.424 --> 10:59.310
Kind of get us into the... becoming a writer again.

10:59.610 --> 11:02.655
Okay, well, my mother was a writer.

11:03.857 --> 11:07.222
And your mother's name is... She's dead now.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.905
In fact, can you tell her your name?

11:08.925 --> 11:10.327
Enid was her first name.

11:10.347 --> 11:10.848
Enid Abraham?

11:10.948 --> 11:12.670
Enid Abrahams at one time, yeah.

11:12.931 --> 11:13.512
How was the writer?

11:14.453 --> 11:15.675
She wrote...

11:16.516 --> 11:18.679
Teleplays for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

11:18.699 --> 11:19.000
Oh, yeah.

11:19.020 --> 11:19.220
Yes.

11:19.580 --> 11:19.861
Oh, yeah.

11:19.881 --> 11:21.643
And had many produced.

11:22.545 --> 11:22.805
Great.

11:23.346 --> 11:24.327
She was a professional writer.

11:24.347 --> 11:24.748
Oh, yes.

11:24.908 --> 11:26.670
When you say she's a writer, you mean she's a professional writer.

11:26.691 --> 11:27.672
She was a professional writer.

11:27.832 --> 11:28.493
Oh, absolutely.

11:28.613 --> 11:40.891
And sometimes I've taught a few courses, like at the Cape Cod Writers Conference, where people come and want to be writers, and they always say, well, you know, how much of this can you learn?

11:41.852 --> 11:43.735
And how much do you have to be born with?

11:43.835 --> 11:45.257
You know, they ask me that over and over.

11:45.507 --> 11:48.070
Yeah, and I don't know the answer.

11:49.152 --> 12:01.047
But in my own case, I'm not even sure I can parse out what I was born with and what I learned, because at a very young age, I was in a class where a lot of writing happened.

12:01.908 --> 12:06.233
Every week there'd be a composition of some kind, and I'd bring these home and show me my mother.

12:06.274 --> 12:11.380
And she would say to me, what would happen if you put that word over there?

12:11.545 --> 12:14.289
Or is there another way to say this?

12:14.309 --> 12:15.671
Or how does this link up?

12:15.691 --> 12:17.774
Or this is a word you should never use.

12:18.515 --> 12:19.195
Okay, she had these.

12:19.456 --> 12:21.559
And even today, I have... What are some of the words?

12:21.579 --> 12:25.945
Oh, any linking word, like however, nevertheless, moreover.

12:25.985 --> 12:27.867
I never use those.

12:27.887 --> 12:31.893
You won't find them, except in direct speech, you know, where some characters use them.

12:31.933 --> 12:35.297
But I will never use them because the links have to be logical.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.801
Okay, that was one of the things she taught me.

12:38.121 --> 12:40.084
I, in fact... A rule, excellent rule, right?

12:40.334 --> 12:41.315
Oh, I think so, too.

12:41.335 --> 12:42.596
Oh, everything she told me is right.

12:43.257 --> 12:47.621
In fact, I kind of codified it into five laws, Enid's laws.

12:47.882 --> 12:48.823
What happened?

12:48.843 --> 12:49.403
Oh, let's see.

12:50.064 --> 12:51.445
Organization is everything.

12:54.008 --> 12:55.650
Push everything as far as you can.

12:55.710 --> 13:00.194
Never contri... Break that one down a little bit.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.516
Why don't we go through the five and go back?

13:01.956 --> 13:02.577
Okay.

13:02.597 --> 13:03.958
You can push everything as far as you can.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.742
In other words...

13:09.747 --> 13:15.873
Well, this is sort of related to another one, which is that fiction, like wrestling, is about reversals.

13:16.614 --> 13:28.366
In other words, you don't ever let a character off easily out of any situation, even though to do so makes the writing much easier.

13:29.507 --> 13:39.197
You push every situation to the absolute limit without sacrificing credibility that you can.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.354
And I think she's right.

13:42.374 --> 13:48.941
I mean, you get, it's in the extreme situation where, I'm not talking about being sensational.

13:48.961 --> 13:52.826
That's, you know what I mean, like sensational, isn't it?

13:52.846 --> 13:55.388
It's just to get to the edge.

13:55.468 --> 14:00.474
I mean, I think you get your more exciting work there.

14:00.994 --> 14:02.977
Okay, how many organizations have you pushed it?

14:03.357 --> 14:07.041
And that's the one I always tell people first, because it's so dry and unarty.

14:07.645 --> 14:09.167
And I think that's important.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.289
Yes, organization.

14:10.329 --> 14:13.094
You must be a very careful outliner.

14:13.454 --> 14:15.458
No, but I believe it.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.467
You see, the other thing is, I don't like to get trapped in the outline.

14:21.487 --> 14:30.762
So at the beginning, my outline starts, sort of like this house, as it was being built, everything was beautiful, planned, and so well organized.

14:31.183 --> 14:34.969
And then as it goes along, it gets more and more big.

14:35.354 --> 14:47.585
And that's okay, because things happen in the middle of the story where, I mean, as in the fan, I mean, I, Jewel Stern, the female sports reporter, was supposed to be quite a minor figure.

14:47.885 --> 14:52.389
And the first time she opened her mouth in the story, I knew she wasn't going to.

14:52.409 --> 14:53.470
But she just becomes pretty important.

14:53.490 --> 14:53.790
Yes.

14:54.131 --> 14:55.032
Yeah, and she just grew.

14:55.092 --> 14:57.774
And she, if I'd done an outline, she would have been very minor.

14:57.794 --> 15:01.798
And she just, once she opened her mouth, I wanted more and more.

15:02.058 --> 15:03.319
We probably got her.

15:14.268 --> 15:19.414
this new breed of woman who was very knowledgeable about sports.

15:20.456 --> 15:21.497
I was just guessing.

15:21.517 --> 15:22.438
No, you're absolutely right.

15:22.538 --> 15:34.933
But they're different from the... I kind of felt that they have a little more detachment from it.

15:35.154 --> 15:39.339
I mean, they have this other perspective that comes from being a woman.

15:39.719 --> 15:41.862
And they never, as a little boy,

15:43.934 --> 15:50.881
because they weren't a little boy, you know, dreamed about one day putting on Yankee pinstripes, because it's an impossible dream for them.

15:51.742 --> 15:56.688
And I think, I mean, another thing the fans are about is like all this boyhood baseball.

15:56.708 --> 16:00.852
Well, the little league, I mean, that was terrific.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.395
He's talking about how the good skill happened.

16:03.415 --> 16:09.662
He's talking about the teams in double-A or triple-A or something, but it's a little league game from Kai's.

16:09.682 --> 16:10.903
Yeah, that's right.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.823
Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

16:13.003 --> 16:13.884
No, you can interrupt.

16:14.645 --> 16:15.506
I have four kids.

16:15.526 --> 16:17.168
Organization is everything.

16:17.228 --> 16:18.169
Push everything.

16:18.189 --> 16:20.953
Okay, never contrive.

16:21.193 --> 16:22.054
Did I say that?

16:23.976 --> 16:24.737
That's your third one.

16:24.857 --> 16:26.019
Yeah, never contrive.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.844
Fiction is about reversals.

16:31.926 --> 16:33.287
Fiction is about reversals.

16:33.307 --> 16:35.890
Yeah, like wrestling.

16:35.910 --> 16:38.173
You know, in wrestling when you get a point...

16:38.491 --> 16:39.772
for a reversal?

16:39.813 --> 16:41.875
I'm talking about college wrestling.

16:42.275 --> 16:44.218
Not the... Genuine wrestling.

16:44.238 --> 16:45.219
Yeah, not these guys.

16:46.661 --> 16:49.043
Not the... I know precisely what you're talking about.

16:49.063 --> 16:51.606
Okay, not the steroid boys.

16:52.427 --> 16:53.408
And what's the fifth one?

16:54.069 --> 16:58.274
Oh, God, I can't believe it.

16:58.294 --> 16:59.716
Yeah, there's another one, too.

16:59.736 --> 17:00.597
Well, they're good rules.

17:00.617 --> 17:03.180
I mean, I'm ready to appropriate them for my own years.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.705
They really stood me in good stead.

17:08.191 --> 17:12.176
So did you think your mother was prepping you for a career as a writer?

17:13.578 --> 17:14.198
No, I don't.

17:14.859 --> 17:15.640
I really don't.

17:15.720 --> 17:24.411
She was just a good mom, you know, and was interested, and this was something she knew.

17:24.431 --> 17:27.194
Did she do any fiction?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.175
Did she do any fiction?

17:28.195 --> 17:30.038
Well, only prose, no.

17:30.098 --> 17:33.822
It was just for television.

17:33.842 --> 17:37.827
Now, before she died, or before she got sick, actually,

17:38.853 --> 17:42.818
She was attracting some interest from Hollywood and things were starting to happen.

17:42.858 --> 17:44.140
And then she got breast cancer.

17:44.180 --> 17:54.735
And quite young, she died when she was, I guess, she had just turned 50, just after her 50th birthday.

17:54.755 --> 17:56.257
But she had the breast cancer.

17:56.277 --> 18:05.229
Like when it came, it kind of, like five years before, or four maybe, it just put the brakes on all of that.

18:05.349 --> 18:08.353
This was quite a while ago, thank you.

18:09.582 --> 18:11.044
the whole career thing kind of stopped.

18:11.164 --> 18:13.387
I mean, I don't understand it, you know.

18:14.088 --> 18:24.803
And then she went through this whole horrible thing, and they go through, you know, where, yes, the two-year period's passed, and you're okay, and... Cancer is the worst thing.

18:24.823 --> 18:25.043
Yeah.

18:25.664 --> 18:30.231
And then, uh... Yeah, and then she wasn't okay.

18:30.251 --> 18:38.442
And they found the recurrence when she went in to have plastic surgery to rebuild the breast after the mastectomy, and that's...

18:39.653 --> 18:41.035
You know, the two-year period, you're okay.

18:41.095 --> 18:42.456
Oh, can I go have this, rebuild that?

18:42.516 --> 18:42.877
Yes.

18:44.899 --> 18:50.345
It's like an elevator just that keeps going down.

18:50.365 --> 18:54.749
So, in fact, she never, I never was a writer while she was alive.

18:56.812 --> 19:08.985
She died in 1978, and I started writing my first book in 1979, and our first kid was born at the very end of 79, too.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.434
See, she never saw the kids or knew that I was going to do that.

19:12.454 --> 19:13.255
Oh, that's very bad.

19:13.275 --> 19:14.316
Yeah, which was too bad.

19:20.764 --> 19:21.344
Yes, I was.

19:21.404 --> 19:26.010
From grade 1 through 12.

19:32.657 --> 19:36.762
No, it doesn't compare, but I don't know whether it would if they were up there now either.

19:37.822 --> 19:40.124
Yeah, they do.

19:43.447 --> 19:43.848
They do.

19:43.948 --> 19:45.329
You don't mind jumping around the board?

19:45.349 --> 19:46.030
No, they do.

19:46.250 --> 19:50.314
And there are some very good teachers.

19:52.035 --> 19:54.357
But things have changed a lot.

19:54.878 --> 20:07.069
Philosophically in the school system, you know, since when I was a kid, I mean, the trend was to kind of find bright kids and stream them out, you know, give them all they can handle, put them with other kids.

20:07.454 --> 20:11.340
just like them, and enrich, and speed them a lot.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.345
I don't know if the speeding up is so good, but the enrichment part is really good.

20:14.385 --> 20:17.129
And now they're into more of an inclusion.

20:18.952 --> 20:26.143
They certainly are in this school system, and bringing up the other kids and having everybody together, and so that... You're being very kind with your euphemisms.

20:28.607 --> 20:30.490
Because people read papers here.

20:30.530 --> 20:35.858
What's happening?

20:36.665 --> 20:42.651
Oh, I think it's—they're dreaming.

20:42.671 --> 20:48.517
So you were—my math is if you graduated in 68, that would make you about— Oh, I was born in 1947.

20:48.657 --> 20:50.459
I'm 47 years old.

20:50.479 --> 20:51.179
47 years old.

20:51.199 --> 20:54.162
So your first book was published when you weren't even 30 yet.

20:54.343 --> 20:54.883
Oh yeah, I was.

20:54.903 --> 21:01.930
It was 1980, so take 15 away from 47 and— 32.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.283
Well, no, I didn't start young.

21:05.424 --> 21:07.667
My whole 20s, I didn't do anything like this.

21:07.927 --> 21:12.073
I worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, too, for five years.

21:12.633 --> 21:15.097
So you kind of follow your mother professionally?

21:15.117 --> 21:18.241
Well, no, she was in the drama department.

21:18.401 --> 21:20.404
I worked in the current affairs department.

21:21.685 --> 21:23.969
Were you writing or an administrative type of stuff?

21:24.029 --> 21:24.329
Neither.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.090
I was a producer.

21:25.130 --> 21:26.933
Well, I started as just like a story editor.

21:26.973 --> 21:30.297
I worked for a program that's a lot like All Things Considered.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.601
It's called As It Happens.

21:31.621 --> 21:34.744
In fact, Susan Stamford, who used to do All Things Considered.

21:35.565 --> 21:36.146
Well, I know her.

21:36.226 --> 21:40.050
I mean, we met way, way back then because she would come up and watch how we did it.

21:41.631 --> 21:42.733
It was a really good program.

21:42.753 --> 21:43.673
It was so exciting.

21:43.754 --> 21:44.154
I loved it.

21:44.174 --> 21:46.837
We had a lot of BBC people came over.

21:46.897 --> 21:50.360
Oh, they were so... Those BBC people.

21:50.781 --> 21:51.602
They were just wonderful.

21:51.622 --> 21:54.064
I learned so much from them about doing this show.

21:54.425 --> 21:55.506
And it was really exciting.

21:55.546 --> 21:56.807
You'd come in every day.

21:57.243 --> 22:02.129
with an hour and a half of time to fill, and nothing, no programming material, unless there was a tape or two left over.

22:02.450 --> 22:07.436
Our job was to come up with two ideas.

22:09.980 --> 22:10.460
How often?

22:10.821 --> 22:11.281
Every day.

22:12.803 --> 22:25.680
And then, every day, come up with the two ideas, find the interviewee, write up some questions for the interviewer, do a pre-interview, write up some questions for the interviewer,

22:26.555 --> 22:34.406
go down in the studio during the afternoon, tape the interview, cut it, write a little intro, an extra... Yeah, and get it in by 5.30.

22:34.466 --> 22:38.492
It'd be kind of nice if you were the on-air person, though.

22:38.532 --> 22:40.695
The on-air person basically is using your stuff, though, right?

22:40.715 --> 22:44.941
Well, no, they did the interviews on live in the afternoon.

22:44.961 --> 22:45.262
Yeah.

22:45.382 --> 22:53.113
Oh, no, we didn't do the... We prepared the interview and did a pre-interview to make sure the person could string two words together.

22:53.133 --> 22:54.655
Because in radio, no matter how...

22:55.023 --> 22:56.344
So it's live, these were live?

22:56.364 --> 22:58.687
No, we very rarely went live.

22:58.867 --> 23:04.533
I mean, the program was packaged live, but it was done in the afternoon.

23:04.553 --> 23:06.175
So there was an opportunity for editing?

23:06.596 --> 23:09.078
Yeah, we cut the tapes, and we cut them physically.

23:09.258 --> 23:10.380
Oh, I see, okay.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.404
Okay, up on a little Ampex machine, physically, with razor blades.

23:14.424 --> 23:19.309
And I'm very, very clumsy with my small motor.

23:19.389 --> 23:22.633
I mean, I often had blood, and often I would mangle tapes

23:22.833 --> 23:27.137
And so you'd be up there on this deadline with twisted tape.

23:28.719 --> 23:29.660
How long did you do this?

23:29.940 --> 23:33.003
Well, I did that for a year, and I just loved it.

23:33.324 --> 23:37.708
And then they started this TV program and asked me if I wanted to go to it.

23:37.728 --> 23:39.610
And I thought, oh, TV is a step up.

23:40.391 --> 23:42.212
You know, that would be a wise career.

23:42.232 --> 23:46.116
And, of course, I loathed working in television.

23:46.637 --> 23:47.798
Radio was so much more fun.

23:48.038 --> 23:52.823
And I began kind of...

23:53.748 --> 23:55.750
searching around for something else to do.

23:55.790 --> 24:00.716
And I had a lot of... I got the idea for the first book.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.720
It was a very successful book.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.142
It did all right.

24:05.582 --> 24:10.408
And I had a lot of vacation time coming in.

24:10.428 --> 24:13.351
I thought I'm going to take it in one... I think it was three months.

24:13.371 --> 24:17.376
And I thought I'd take it in one block and they let me do that.

24:17.693 --> 24:19.154
And just see how this goes.

24:19.535 --> 24:26.241
And at the end of three months, the book was just about finished.

24:26.581 --> 24:28.763
How many people say it?

24:28.783 --> 24:29.644
Well, it happened.

24:31.105 --> 24:33.007
Did you do this with the contract?

24:33.368 --> 24:37.011
No, it was totally speculative.

24:37.251 --> 24:38.132
Did you have an agent?

24:38.893 --> 24:40.494
No, I got him after.

24:40.534 --> 24:41.235
What was the agent?

24:41.595 --> 24:43.016
Well, I have a new agent.

24:43.677 --> 24:46.840
In terms of managing my career, I've been an imbecile.

24:47.208 --> 24:52.754
But I have a wonderful agent now, whose name is Molly Friedrich.

24:53.054 --> 24:54.415
F-R-I-E-D-R-I-C-H?

24:55.096 --> 24:57.118
F-R-I-E-D-R-I-C-H.

24:57.138 --> 25:00.241
Yeah, her father is Otto Friedrich, who was a member of the editor of Time.

25:00.321 --> 25:00.842
Oh, sure.

25:01.262 --> 25:02.664
Oh, he's written a couple of pretty good books.

25:02.684 --> 25:03.785
Yes, he sure has.

25:04.306 --> 25:07.148
There's one on Paris in that.

25:07.189 --> 25:13.335
There's one on the end of the world and people's conceptions of these world endings.

25:13.355 --> 25:16.438
Yeah, and they have pretty good books.

25:16.958 --> 25:25.226
In fact, New York Magazine a few, maybe, what was it, a month or two ago, did a cover on the hundred smartest New Yorkers.

25:25.266 --> 25:26.427
You know their kind of stuff.

25:26.547 --> 25:27.268
Was he there?

25:27.288 --> 25:28.509
No, Molly was.

25:28.529 --> 25:28.950
Molly was?

25:28.970 --> 25:31.652
Yeah, Molly was.

25:32.633 --> 25:33.294
That's terrific.

25:33.454 --> 25:35.536
Ever since I landed with her, which was for this book.

25:37.878 --> 25:39.340
Is this your first with Warner?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.623
Yeah, Lights Out and Revolution No.

25:42.643 --> 25:42.763
9.

25:43.047 --> 25:46.211
were with Mysterious, which is owned by Warren.

25:47.113 --> 25:47.573
That's right.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.859
Yeah, now... Okay, yeah, okay.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.381
Oh, that's great.

25:53.401 --> 25:54.102
Where was he?

25:54.122 --> 25:54.983
In Boston?

25:55.003 --> 25:55.604
Yeah.

25:56.165 --> 26:01.973
You talk about not outlining, just parenthetically, he said this book.

26:01.993 --> 26:07.460
He had a 254 page outline.

26:07.781 --> 26:08.141
Wow.

26:09.764 --> 26:10.705
No, I couldn't.

26:11.065 --> 26:12.227
My outlines are...

26:12.747 --> 26:15.050
Maybe 12 pages or something.

26:15.191 --> 26:16.833
I like these organic things.

26:16.853 --> 26:18.836
They just kind of grow.

26:18.856 --> 26:21.039
But it is very carefully plotted, I have to say.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.543
Your book is very carefully plotted.

26:23.843 --> 26:29.472
See, I have to know that I'm going to hit these wave stations.

26:29.652 --> 26:41.910
If I just know in my own mind that, okay, there's going to be this scene here, and I can get to it, and then Z is going to be something like this, I'm okay.

26:42.565 --> 26:46.731
I have all these warning bells that go off in my mind if something's wrong.

26:47.592 --> 26:52.739
For me, it's not a situation of like, I'm blocked, I can't think of how to do it.

26:54.181 --> 26:58.427
I always can think of several ways, and the question is, what is the best way?

26:58.508 --> 27:02.553
So I have to kind of, in my mind, it's like dominoes, think them all the way through.

27:02.874 --> 27:10.845
If I go this way, I love this now, on page 80, what's it going to be like on page 250 if I do this?

27:10.925 --> 27:11.526
That's the

27:12.012 --> 27:14.614
It's almost like a computer, the plotting part.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.456
You have to just... permutations.

27:16.937 --> 27:17.898
Now, I've got a theory.

27:17.978 --> 27:19.659
These are not the Boston Red Sox.

27:19.679 --> 27:20.720
These are the Sox.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.101
Yes.

27:21.341 --> 27:22.942
However, it's Boston.

27:23.263 --> 27:24.404
That's clear.

27:24.424 --> 27:36.035
The terrain is very... And you really don't libel the ball team, so I'm... My guess is that maybe the mascot has something to do with it.

27:36.175 --> 27:38.217
Yes, the Red Sox don't have a mascot, of course.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.580
And they were adamantly opposed to doing that kind of a thing.

27:42.218 --> 27:46.983
And I have to tell you, because I'm trying to do a lot of reading, that was a giveaway for me earlier.

27:47.403 --> 27:53.610
I felt, not a giveaway, I felt this mascot, not here gratuitously, this mascot is here for a reason.

27:54.531 --> 27:54.971
That's good.

27:55.031 --> 27:57.113
That's my sense.

27:57.554 --> 28:02.299
A good writer doesn't just throw something in here for the sake of having it there.

28:02.499 --> 28:04.641
And the Red Sox have never had a mascot.

28:04.681 --> 28:11.348
That was a technical reason why I didn't do Red Sox, but I had other reasons too.

28:11.817 --> 28:16.082
that are really much harder to put into words.

28:16.542 --> 28:28.155
But sometimes if I... I didn't want to use a real team because I didn't want to be trapped in their real history.

28:28.475 --> 28:29.176
Yeah, but you are.

28:29.196 --> 28:30.838
This is their first team.

28:30.858 --> 28:32.920
You can win the world championship in fourth straight.

28:33.501 --> 28:35.823
Yes, but I... Finally, hallelujah.

28:36.624 --> 28:39.568
It's true, but I wanted to be free.

28:39.708 --> 28:40.308
Okay, this is what.

28:40.348 --> 28:41.790
I wanted the freedom to...

28:43.087 --> 28:44.969
Are you going to have coffee?

28:44.989 --> 28:45.869
I wouldn't mind a cup.

28:45.949 --> 28:46.910
It would be great.

28:46.930 --> 28:47.391
What do you like in it?

28:47.411 --> 28:48.211
Just black for me.

28:50.814 --> 28:51.194
Nothing.

28:51.494 --> 28:51.694
You sure?

28:51.714 --> 28:52.035
No milk.

28:52.055 --> 28:53.376
Just milk.

28:53.656 --> 28:57.019
And just black for me.

28:57.039 --> 29:01.783
I didn't want to get... I want to be able to make my... The red light's on.

29:01.983 --> 29:02.203
Okay.

29:02.223 --> 29:03.404
Just do a visual check.

29:03.524 --> 29:04.225
Everything's fine.

29:04.245 --> 29:04.685
All right.

29:04.725 --> 29:05.246
Is it turning?

29:05.586 --> 29:06.307
Yeah, it's turning.

29:07.207 --> 29:12.672
I don't want to get... I want to have the freedom to... It was a question of freedom.

29:13.917 --> 29:18.162
to move away from... I didn't want to have to describe any city exactly.

29:19.063 --> 29:20.145
Oh, there's no question that it's Boston.

29:20.165 --> 29:21.366
But there's no question that it's Boston.

29:21.386 --> 29:21.587
I know.

29:22.027 --> 29:25.492
Okay, you and I know that, but there have been other pre-publications.

29:25.512 --> 29:25.912
Well, you know what?

29:25.932 --> 29:28.395
The Library Journal suggests the Chicago website.

29:28.415 --> 29:28.916
Exactly.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.017
That's what I was going to bring up.

29:30.057 --> 29:31.019
I couldn't believe it.

29:31.039 --> 29:34.143
I was just reading this on the way down.

29:34.163 --> 29:34.403
I said, who?

29:34.423 --> 29:34.743
Unbelievable.

29:34.763 --> 29:35.064
I know.

29:35.604 --> 29:36.105
Exactly.

29:36.405 --> 29:39.049
So, there you go.

29:39.109 --> 29:39.329
Yeah.

29:40.030 --> 29:40.651
That's a good point.

29:40.671 --> 29:42.473
Okay, and in fact, even my editor...

29:42.875 --> 29:49.342
when I gave him the first hundred pages, said, oh, is this Boston or Chicago?

29:49.842 --> 29:50.883
He doesn't know baseball.

29:51.344 --> 29:52.445
See, a lot of people don't.

29:53.046 --> 30:01.655
Like this guy from the Globe, you know, who confesses that he doesn't like baseball, or doesn't know much, or doesn't even like it.

30:01.675 --> 30:07.001
But that was the good thing, because I was trying to, this book isn't just for baseball people.

30:07.021 --> 30:08.342
No, of course not.

30:08.879 --> 30:12.584
And that's why that Globe review I like, because he said he doesn't like baseball, but he likes the book.

30:13.124 --> 30:23.037
Well, I think the triumph of the book is really that, as I was telling Connie on the way down, the way you really track this guy's descent into madness is very cleverly done.

30:23.077 --> 30:29.925
He's kind of a jerk at the beginning, but he's not sociopathic at the point.

30:36.706 --> 30:39.389
Well, that's the pushing it as far as you can.

30:39.409 --> 30:45.096
I mean, it's taking the fandom and just going with it.

30:45.116 --> 30:48.380
I mean, are there any, I mean, the stabbing of Monica Sellis, for instance?

30:48.400 --> 30:52.164
That happened after I had, the stabbing of Monica Sellis happened after.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.028
After you started the book?

30:55.128 --> 31:01.255
Yes, after I had the whole, not after I started writing, but it happened after I had that all planned out.

31:01.275 --> 31:02.697
Especially the kind of thing that,

31:03.706 --> 31:05.750
Yes, exactly.

31:05.770 --> 31:17.930
But that didn't... In fact, I didn't like it when it happened, the Monica Seles thing, because I thought, oh my God, they're going to say... He ripped off the Monica... Gill as a knife salesman was the very first thing in terms of Gill.

31:18.411 --> 31:19.753
And I knew it had to end.

31:20.134 --> 31:28.148
And also being a knife thrower and all this, I knew there was going to be a scene where he... He's terrific with the knife.

31:28.589 --> 31:29.410
Yeah, where he...

31:29.812 --> 31:30.793
So that was all set.

31:30.813 --> 31:36.659
And then when this jerk jumps out of the tennis, you know, stands and... This guy screwed up my book.

31:36.679 --> 31:38.240
Yeah, that's right.

31:38.260 --> 31:38.721
I hated him.

31:38.741 --> 31:44.826
You saw that potential back at the beginning of your brother, that ugly thing.

31:44.846 --> 31:45.187
That chain, yeah.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.289
Yeah, that's... Bringing it, stretching it to the... Yes, exactly.

31:47.309 --> 31:48.590
...where you saw.

31:48.610 --> 31:48.710
Yeah.

31:48.730 --> 31:49.591
But it's rampant.

31:49.651 --> 31:50.572
It's not unique.

31:50.592 --> 31:56.598
I mean, the last time we went to an NFL game was years ago, and there was this one guy there cheering for Buffalo.

31:56.838 --> 31:59.160
In fact, we saw O'Shea Simpson playing this game.

32:04.287 --> 32:07.411
I said, oh yeah, I've never gone back to a game since.

32:07.431 --> 32:09.052
It was very, very uncomfortable.

32:09.072 --> 32:11.976
Was this at Foxborough?

32:11.996 --> 32:14.499
Yeah, same thing.

32:14.519 --> 32:17.262
I was going to tear this guy apart for cheering for my fault.

32:17.282 --> 32:18.543
The guy says, hey, that's cool.

32:18.763 --> 32:20.325
I won't see how it will work.

32:20.585 --> 32:20.906
I know.

32:21.727 --> 32:24.810
Well, that's what I'm talking about, like this deep emotional investment.

32:25.511 --> 32:31.438
As though this really is a war, and these people are really carrying your pennant into battle.

32:32.439 --> 32:32.539
Yeah.

32:32.924 --> 32:36.267
And of course we see the soccer riots in Europe.

32:36.287 --> 32:36.587
Yeah.

32:37.949 --> 32:38.069
Crazy.

32:38.089 --> 32:38.449
Yeah.

32:38.589 --> 32:44.314
But, you know, one of the things this strike proves is that this is not a war.

32:45.736 --> 32:49.979
This is not our army with their uniforms, you know.

32:49.999 --> 32:55.464
Well, I think the fans are, for the most part, pretty resilient.

32:56.125 --> 33:01.049
I think baseball's going to find that we can probably live without the major league.

33:01.069 --> 33:01.750
Ah, jeez.

33:03.451 --> 33:04.712
I just don't know.

33:04.732 --> 33:08.055
I mean, have you seen some of those photographs that have been published?

33:08.115 --> 33:09.777
There have been several.

33:09.797 --> 33:11.058
I mean, there's always the same photograph.

33:11.078 --> 33:12.639
It's a coach.

33:13.360 --> 33:20.486
I mean, a real coach from the team glancing or looking at the replacement players working out.

33:20.506 --> 33:21.547
Have you seen any of those photographs?

33:22.648 --> 33:22.928
I don't know.

33:22.948 --> 33:23.048
Okay.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.850
And there was the Times-published one.

33:25.230 --> 33:26.832
And Sports Illustrated had it, too.

33:27.012 --> 33:28.934
Oh, my.

33:28.954 --> 33:30.735
Guy, where is that Sports Illustrated?

33:30.755 --> 33:32.597
There's a hilarious photograph.

33:33.185 --> 33:44.896
Anyway, there's always something... I don't know.

33:45.036 --> 33:53.024
It was the one with replacement players.

33:53.044 --> 33:54.125
When's he coming home from school?

33:54.645 --> 33:58.429
Anyway, there's always something wrong with the replacement players.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.351
And even you can see it.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.533
They don't look like

34:02.783 --> 34:05.606
I mean, even you, not just the coach can see it.

34:06.006 --> 34:16.598
You know, he's obviously in his mind aghast at this, or even disgusted that he has to... Now, these guys are probably very good at baseball, but... Thanks, guys.

34:16.618 --> 34:32.655
But there's such a huge gulf even between these guys who've lived... A lot of these replacement guys must have lived a life of baseball and hoping and hoping the whole time that they're still... You know, let's say you moved it to another field, like music.

34:33.732 --> 34:39.099
You know, it would be fun after a few drinks over at their house if they sat down at the piano and you all sang songs together.

34:39.639 --> 34:42.583
But you wouldn't go to Carnegie Hall to hear them.

34:42.603 --> 34:45.466
And I think it's the same with these professional ball fans.

34:45.486 --> 34:49.211
You know, that's the level they're on there, the kind you go to Carnegie Hall for.

34:49.551 --> 34:59.824
Were you trying to explore themes of fantasy, where fantasy meets reality, recession, or mainly, fundamentally trying to tell a good story?

34:59.905 --> 35:04.350
Oh, I'm fundamentally trying to, oh, I never let the themes or anything clutter up.

35:04.851 --> 35:06.532
This is supposed to be a good story.

35:07.353 --> 35:12.579
But, you know, I find I, unless there's some meat in it, I myself can't sustain the interest.

35:12.599 --> 35:13.881
Now, also, I don't think it's a good story.

35:13.901 --> 35:25.313
I mean, I can't, in my own reading, if it's just a book that's pure entertainment, as they call it, you know, with incidents, and I can't.

35:25.413 --> 35:26.455
It doesn't hold me.

35:26.495 --> 35:29.158
Well, I mean, where do you put yourself?

35:29.178 --> 35:29.558
I've interviewed...

35:31.968 --> 35:37.316
who considers himself an entertainer.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.719
And he's very good at it.

35:38.739 --> 35:39.940
Well, he was.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.022
I think he was alive.

35:41.363 --> 35:42.224
Di, Charlie.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.668
Charlie's going crazy.

35:45.890 --> 35:48.414
It's just the costume.

35:49.696 --> 35:50.958
What a ham.

35:51.298 --> 35:52.079
My God.

35:53.121 --> 35:55.144
What a ham.

35:55.805 --> 35:59.511
Look, he's shaking, you know, as if he's...

35:59.896 --> 36:00.537
No.

36:02.319 --> 36:15.577
I'll get to this on the transcription, you know.

36:15.597 --> 36:17.520
I'll be listening.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.945
Okay, come on, let's go.

36:20.965 --> 36:22.607
Well, Tom Clancy, yeah.

36:22.627 --> 36:24.790
Well, entertainment.

36:25.242 --> 36:28.466
say that you're an entertainer, or would you go beyond that?

36:28.487 --> 36:32.352
You say that it doesn't have a little bit of a bite to it, and you yourself get bored.

36:32.432 --> 36:33.894
Okay, I'm an entertainer.

36:34.915 --> 36:35.977
No, it's that.

36:35.997 --> 36:42.206
Yes, but it's in... You know, I don't know if you know, have you read any Graham Greene at all?

36:42.867 --> 36:46.111
Well, he called... He divided his work into two.

36:46.752 --> 36:54.743
I mean, the ones like The Power and the Glory were his novels, or whatever he called them, and the ones like...

36:55.162 --> 37:03.996
Stamboul train, a gun for sale, he called those as entertainments.

37:04.016 --> 37:11.849
I aspire to writing entertainments of that nature.

37:12.350 --> 37:15.515
Probably because of those that Graham Greene was never given a Nobel Prize.

37:15.976 --> 37:16.837
Oh, I think so.

37:17.799 --> 37:20.443
Because he entertained them.

37:21.183 --> 37:22.265
People liked him too much.

37:22.285 --> 37:23.026
Yes, that's right.

37:23.426 --> 37:25.389
He was too accessible in a kind of way.

37:27.072 --> 37:28.053
But I think he was great.

37:29.195 --> 37:34.262
And I think the entertainments are better than the novels generally.

37:34.823 --> 37:46.319
I think he gets the whole, the same depth and profundity, and he gets it quicker in what he called his entertainment.

37:46.339 --> 37:47.281
I mean, that's just my opinion.

37:47.321 --> 37:48.102
But...

37:49.313 --> 37:59.568
So when you began writing your first book, did you have in mind a thriller, an audience, a certain kind of a reader that you were writing for?

37:59.589 --> 37:59.809
No.

38:00.229 --> 38:04.236
I just wanted to— Did you perceive it as commercial fiction, literary fiction, what?

38:04.816 --> 38:08.021
I didn't come at it from that point of view.

38:08.041 --> 38:14.191
I just wanted to tell this—I had the idea for the story, and I just wanted to see if I could do it.

38:14.952 --> 38:18.477
I hadn't thought it out in those terms.

38:21.359 --> 38:23.723
Oh, that's wonderful.

38:24.123 --> 38:25.185
That's great.

38:25.385 --> 38:26.267
This is the picture.

38:26.327 --> 38:36.904
That could be me, for my sake.

38:37.745 --> 38:40.610
I mean, I would look much different.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.112
And the coach's face.

38:42.774 --> 38:44.416
Oh, the dream of that kind of thing.

38:44.476 --> 38:46.279
Don't you respect Swackney Anderson?

38:46.299 --> 38:48.683
Oh, tremendously.

38:49.000 --> 38:55.432
He's 26 victories away from going into the third most victories of all time.

38:56.153 --> 38:58.377
And he might have just pissed off his career.

38:58.497 --> 39:01.342
But he said, I don't want an asterisk next to my record.

39:01.623 --> 39:06.191
I'd just assume take fourth place the way it is with Major League fourth place.

39:06.371 --> 39:06.572
Whatever.

39:06.592 --> 39:10.198
Of course he's making $1.2 million and he's 61 and he can do this.

39:10.786 --> 39:12.148
But it's still a pretty gussy call.

39:12.168 --> 39:13.770
Yes, it is, and none of the others are doing it.

39:14.090 --> 39:17.275
You know, and plenty of them are making big money, too, and don't have to worry.

39:17.295 --> 39:18.096
No, I think it's terrific.

39:18.156 --> 39:18.977
Well, I always like him.

39:18.997 --> 39:20.519
He's my favorite manager.

39:20.559 --> 39:24.184
What a write-up they gave him in the New York Times.

39:24.424 --> 39:25.746
A profile in courage.

39:26.007 --> 39:26.708
I didn't see that.

39:26.728 --> 39:29.131
Why did that stop the phrase that you didn't like?

39:29.151 --> 39:32.696
That's Kennedy's record.

39:32.716 --> 39:35.519
No, I agree with you totally.

39:35.539 --> 39:35.920
I don't know.

39:36.781 --> 39:39.645
The thematic stuff just, or whatever you want to call it,

39:43.017 --> 39:46.301
I mean, there's, it's just, I don't know, it's hard to explain.

39:46.341 --> 39:53.130
I don't plan for it, but the story that, the stories that interest me have, have something to that.

39:53.150 --> 39:53.610
That's all.

39:54.071 --> 39:58.256
This is a cipher of movies, Tri-Star, I guess.

39:58.276 --> 40:02.582
They've hired Cal Ripken to be the baseball consultant.

40:02.602 --> 40:03.944
Yeah.

40:03.964 --> 40:05.866
Well, he's got nothing else to do.

40:05.886 --> 40:08.269
What will the film in Camping Yards do you think are up here?

40:08.529 --> 40:09.010
I don't know.

40:09.150 --> 40:12.214
Oh, I don't know what they'll, I mean, they fake all that, you know.

40:12.447 --> 40:13.488
Are you going to have a ballpark?

40:13.508 --> 40:14.629
Yeah, they have to have a ballpark.

40:14.709 --> 40:15.170
I don't know.

40:15.210 --> 40:18.353
Maybe a league ballpark, a little bandbox in a ballpark.

40:19.174 --> 40:20.154
Yeah, they could use a mile.

40:20.255 --> 40:21.676
I don't know how they're going to do it.

40:22.036 --> 40:25.840
They have... So it is in production?

40:26.000 --> 40:26.841
Oh, no, it isn't in production.

40:26.861 --> 40:30.485
They just signed a director this week.

40:30.505 --> 40:31.546
Are you going to do these scripts?

40:31.566 --> 40:32.787
No, the script's done.

40:33.968 --> 40:35.609
It was written by some Hollywood pro.

40:35.850 --> 40:40.294
It's done, and apparently...

40:41.843 --> 40:43.065
The producer loves it.

40:43.926 --> 40:46.569
Her name is Wendy Feinerman.

40:46.589 --> 40:53.258
She co-produced Forrest Gump, and I think she's a real bulldog type.

40:54.740 --> 41:03.772
I've only spoken to her once, but I read an article about the making of Forrest Gump and how she had this for nine years, and she just kept pushing and pushing.

41:03.832 --> 41:06.435
Are you going to be involved in this, or is it pretty much fair?

41:06.455 --> 41:08.418
Oh, I'm uninvolved.

41:08.438 --> 41:10.821
They're very polite to me and really nice.

41:11.122 --> 41:14.245
There's no, I have no raison d'etre there at all.

41:14.325 --> 41:21.934
I asked George Higgins about Eddie Coyle and he said, once the check cleared the bank, he said I was out of the loop and happy to bring this up.

41:21.954 --> 41:31.784
Okay, no, you know, that's, I've had, Lights Out is at Paramount, the previous book, and not a deal like the TriStar.

41:31.824 --> 41:34.908
The TriStar was this buyout where it's gone.

41:35.168 --> 41:35.749
It's theirs.

41:35.989 --> 41:36.409
It's theirs.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.251
Do they buy the characters too?

41:38.271 --> 41:39.913
Do you have, can you bring the characters, anything else?

41:40.636 --> 41:47.165
I still, there is some language in that about that in the contract, but it was too long to finish reading.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.851
There are always other books you can't read.

41:50.871 --> 41:52.053
I can't, no, I can't.

41:52.073 --> 41:53.575
See, I'm bad at that.

41:53.595 --> 41:56.139
I hope I was taken care of by my agent.

41:56.159 --> 41:58.903
I don't really read through the contract.

42:00.825 --> 42:03.730
But with Lights Out, it was an auction situation.

42:04.371 --> 42:05.412
The producers are

42:05.915 --> 42:12.263
These people at Paramount named Neufeld Ramey Productions, who do, they do the Tom Plansky ones, by the way, like Red October.

42:12.283 --> 42:13.844
They do great, in my opinion.

42:15.406 --> 42:19.932
And I was, they, they improve the work.

42:20.933 --> 42:24.477
Well, they make it, they transform it into a film.

42:24.597 --> 42:26.539
Yeah, but they do a real nice job.

42:27.861 --> 42:29.723
You don't say they make it, they improve it.

42:30.224 --> 42:30.644
Okay.

42:30.804 --> 42:31.445
Yeah, I don't.

42:31.465 --> 42:32.426
Or you can if you want.

42:32.446 --> 42:33.588
No, don't let me say that.

42:33.788 --> 42:35.310
Please don't use that.

42:35.330 --> 42:35.550
No.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.663
I know how this stuff looks in quote.

42:37.683 --> 42:38.584
Yeah, don't say that.

42:38.864 --> 42:40.407
They do a very nice job.

42:40.427 --> 42:42.329
And, yeah, please don't do that to me.

42:42.349 --> 42:44.012
I wouldn't say that.

42:44.032 --> 42:47.136
Okay.

42:47.156 --> 42:53.626
But they took an option on it, and they hired a couple writers, and nothing happened.

42:54.387 --> 42:55.668
I mean, they didn't get what they wanted.

42:56.730 --> 43:00.255
I was out to see my brother and sister over Christmas in Los Angeles.

43:00.674 --> 43:02.236
A little Canadian accent.

43:02.256 --> 43:02.797
What, on out?

43:03.518 --> 43:03.699
Yeah.

43:03.799 --> 43:04.239
Sometimes.

43:04.560 --> 43:10.108
Well, you know, I really don't even know how to spell a lot of words because I was educated in both places and I have different spellings.

43:10.128 --> 43:12.391
I make a lot on the States that way.

43:13.914 --> 43:14.374
I went to L.A.

43:14.815 --> 43:15.736
to see my brother and sister.

43:15.757 --> 43:21.745
And while I was there, I called, you know, I have an agent out there who handles the movie.

43:21.826 --> 43:23.628
And I called him to say hi, I'm out here.

43:23.708 --> 43:29.517
And he said, oh, well, why don't you, do you want to meet these guys, Bob Ramey and Mace Neufeldt?

43:29.935 --> 43:30.676
why you're here.

43:30.716 --> 43:32.838
And I said, sure.

43:32.858 --> 43:34.399
And he said, okay, we'll go over and see him.

43:34.419 --> 43:35.019
I'll set up a meeting.

43:35.039 --> 43:35.460
And he did.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.223
And I went over and we had, just Bob Ramey was there, and we had this talk.

43:39.303 --> 43:45.629
And he was a very impressive guy and, I mean, really knew the book, you know, wasn't, yeah, the ins and outs of it.

43:46.489 --> 43:49.432
And we began talking about he wasn't happy with what he'd been getting.

43:49.512 --> 43:55.818
And he said, do you, you know, I began just saying certain things I would do.

43:55.858 --> 43:59.841
And the upshot is that I'm now doing a screenplay

44:00.580 --> 44:01.722
for it lights out.

44:01.802 --> 44:04.646
I mean, it just came out of this little meeting.

44:04.806 --> 44:05.727
That's good.

44:05.747 --> 44:07.390
Yeah, so... Are you doing it here?

44:07.470 --> 44:08.171
Do you have to do it?

44:08.191 --> 44:10.354
No, I'm doing it here, and that's what I'm working on right now.

44:10.454 --> 44:12.577
I'm about, oh... I think they're short, right?

44:12.597 --> 44:13.198
120 pages?

44:13.218 --> 44:15.922
120 pages, and I'm on about 40 right now.

44:16.483 --> 44:22.251
And I just started a couple weeks ago, so it doesn't... Yeah, I mean, it's a different kind of thing.

44:22.331 --> 44:28.360
But I have a... I mean, I have the idea for the next book, too, but I didn't think this would take long, and

44:28.795 --> 44:29.797
You write visually.

44:29.817 --> 44:31.860
I have to say that it's very visually.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.903
It shouldn't be that difficult.

44:36.346 --> 44:38.970
Elroy's books, for instance, I mean, I think they've all been options.

44:39.011 --> 44:40.473
I don't think any of them have been done.

44:40.493 --> 44:45.520
I mean, his books are almost impossible to transform into films.

44:45.601 --> 44:49.627
I think yours, on the other hand, really lend themselves to that.

44:49.927 --> 44:51.409
You must be thinking visually.

44:52.231 --> 44:53.012
Oh, I think I do.

44:53.773 --> 44:54.194
Yeah.

44:54.214 --> 44:57.098
That's one of the things I like about it.

44:57.432 --> 44:59.735
As a human being you have a real emotional life, right?

45:01.197 --> 45:09.729
But as a writer I have this almost emotional life that I can go hide in.

45:10.710 --> 45:12.994
Or sink into when I'm working.

45:13.795 --> 45:16.759
Yeah, these scenes are very vivid in my mind and I'm sort of there.

45:16.799 --> 45:21.906
Are you a baseball fanatic?

45:21.926 --> 45:23.809
I'm not a fanatic, but I'm certainly a fan.

45:24.109 --> 45:26.933
And both my sons play.

45:27.588 --> 45:36.778
Seth is in his, let's see, he's a freshman in high school so he's going to be playing there and he's in his last year at Babe Ruth.

45:37.599 --> 45:40.823
And Ben just finished Little League and he's going to be in his first year at Babe Ruth.

45:40.923 --> 45:46.990
And they're both, you know, very good, you know, for local baseball players.

45:47.010 --> 45:47.891
And they love the game.

45:47.911 --> 45:53.517
And of course that's another, this little, so I've watched a million Little League games now.

45:54.017 --> 45:56.380
I love Little League games.

45:57.119 --> 46:00.863
You know, I've seen things there, too, that were useful in this.

46:00.883 --> 46:01.864
Yes, I like them, too.

46:02.405 --> 46:08.051
Do you see the parents that, I mean, have Gill at his kid's game?

46:08.071 --> 46:13.877
I've never seen anything to that degree, but I've certainly seen things.

46:14.018 --> 46:16.340
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

46:16.640 --> 46:17.061
Yeah.

46:17.922 --> 46:22.587
Or just get too emotionally involved with it.

46:23.984 --> 46:26.748
I think he snaps at that game, as a matter of fact.

46:26.768 --> 46:30.493
Maybe he snaps a little earlier than that.

46:30.513 --> 46:34.718
I think he goes over... I mean there's a point of no return there.

46:34.939 --> 46:37.001
Basically removing the job, too, I hear.

46:37.021 --> 46:37.422
Yeah.

46:38.363 --> 46:39.905
Yeah.

46:39.925 --> 46:43.410
You've got to do half your backwoods at that point.

46:43.430 --> 46:43.910
The Maine.

46:44.331 --> 46:45.012
Oh, the Maine.

46:45.092 --> 46:46.874
I went to school up in Maine.

46:48.777 --> 46:49.418
Oh, did you?

46:49.438 --> 46:53.383
I'm kind of familiar with that subculture up there.

46:53.819 --> 46:55.561
Yeah, yeah.

46:58.703 --> 46:59.644
Well, I've been up there.

46:59.664 --> 47:04.509
So what are you working on now after this?

47:04.729 --> 47:06.791
Oh, I have a new idea.

47:09.573 --> 47:10.774
It's pretty much planned out.

47:11.435 --> 47:14.758
And as soon as I finish the screenplay, I'm going to start writing.

47:15.759 --> 47:16.659
With water?

47:17.100 --> 47:18.341
Is this a one-book deal?

47:18.361 --> 47:22.965
This is a one-book deal, and we'll see where we take it.

47:23.755 --> 47:24.676
I mean, they are the first.

47:26.858 --> 47:29.061
Have you ever had an auction before?

47:29.081 --> 47:30.082
Have you had options?

47:30.102 --> 47:31.523
The first book was auctioned.

47:31.543 --> 47:34.066
Which is amazing, isn't it?

47:34.086 --> 47:34.286
Yeah.

47:34.467 --> 47:35.348
The first book out.

47:35.428 --> 47:39.732
Tell me a little bit about that.

47:39.752 --> 47:40.673
You had an agent.

47:40.693 --> 47:42.195
That's not this agent that you had.

47:42.215 --> 47:48.021
Yeah, and he... I mean, I didn't know... I gave the book to him, I think, in July.

47:48.061 --> 47:51.585
And he...

47:54.637 --> 47:55.878
And I didn't hear from him at all.

47:56.038 --> 48:02.786
And then in September he called me up and he said, oh, hi, yeah, I've read it.

48:02.806 --> 48:03.446
I love the book.

48:03.787 --> 48:06.670
And there'll be an auction on December, whatever it was.

48:06.690 --> 48:13.016
I mean, he submits the thing in July and they have an auction in December.

48:13.036 --> 48:13.497
Yeah.

48:13.517 --> 48:14.058
That's pretty good.

48:14.338 --> 48:14.838
Yeah.

48:14.858 --> 48:17.822
And so... You didn't even hear from these people for nine months.

48:18.162 --> 48:18.542
Yeah.

48:19.203 --> 48:19.483
Yeah.

48:19.663 --> 48:23.007
So, yeah, I mean, it was a very...

48:23.442 --> 48:24.443
It was very exciting.

48:24.463 --> 48:25.724
Who was the first publisher?

48:25.744 --> 48:26.805
It was Macmillan.

48:26.865 --> 48:28.067
Oh, Macmillan did it.

48:29.088 --> 48:32.271
Yeah.

48:32.291 --> 48:33.632
That book did very well, I think.

48:33.913 --> 48:34.173
It did.

48:34.593 --> 48:35.574
I think it did quite well.

48:37.096 --> 48:40.940
I mean, don't print this, but it probably would have been better if we hadn't gone with Macmillan.

48:40.960 --> 48:41.761
That was a mistake.

48:42.982 --> 48:45.664
That I didn't know was a mistake.

48:45.685 --> 48:50.630
I mean, because I knew nothing then.

48:50.650 --> 48:50.950
How so?

48:50.970 --> 48:53.112
Because fiction, they just didn't do it.

48:53.513 --> 48:56.497
Especially the thriller-type version.

48:56.517 --> 48:59.741
I would have been better across the hall with Scribdness, for instance, because they do a lot of it.

48:59.821 --> 49:03.646
Yes, and Simon Schuster wanted it, too, and they're willing to pay all the rest as much.

49:04.267 --> 49:05.589
Yeah, money.

49:05.629 --> 49:06.330
But I didn't know.

49:08.212 --> 49:11.356
But, you know, they won the auction.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.759
How did they deal with the marketing end of it?

49:13.779 --> 49:17.244
Well, not so well.

49:17.264 --> 49:18.185
Oh, that's incredible.

49:18.746 --> 49:18.846
Yeah.

49:19.838 --> 49:21.560
So you did one book with them, I guess?

49:21.660 --> 49:24.323
I only did one book with them.

49:24.343 --> 49:28.327
Well, then I was with Dutton for a number of years.

49:29.248 --> 49:29.809
Dutton is a good thing.

49:30.069 --> 49:33.192
Yeah, but you see, they... They changed their liking.

49:33.613 --> 49:38.118
Yes, and when that happened, all the people who I had worked with were gone.

49:39.759 --> 49:40.500
Like, instantly.

49:40.861 --> 49:43.984
And that's when we went to Mysterious.

49:44.565 --> 49:48.649
Where I'm really, I mean, and Warner, but I have the same editor that I had in Mysterious.

49:48.669 --> 49:49.710
He's Bill Malloy.

49:49.910 --> 49:54.720
who's the editor-in-chief at Mysterious, and he'll do things for Warner, too.

49:54.740 --> 49:56.223
He's a character, isn't he?

49:56.644 --> 49:58.467
I've met him a few times, yeah.

49:58.527 --> 50:02.716
I've met him at a couple of ABAs.

50:02.876 --> 50:04.499
He's a fanatical book collector.

50:04.519 --> 50:06.644
He's one guy we should have talked to.

50:06.664 --> 50:10.872
He's got his own bookstore in New York, and his own press.

50:11.982 --> 50:25.179
Okay, well, see, the garage hasn't finished yet, so I don't.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.781
They just urethaned the floor yesterday.

50:27.583 --> 50:36.214
I write in our bedroom, on a K-Pro computer.

50:36.975 --> 50:37.896
Do you know what that is, Edwin?

50:38.136 --> 50:38.357
No.

50:38.437 --> 50:40.099
Okay.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.501
They're not made anymore.

50:41.521 --> 50:42.162
I haven't been for years.

50:42.762 --> 50:44.864
It's a, I mean, it's the most primitive.

50:45.645 --> 50:48.127
I got it, I think, in 1983 or 4.

50:48.347 --> 50:57.536
And my brother's always saying to me, Pete, you know, you got in on this, you know, technical revolution and then stopped on the first rung of the ladder.

50:57.576 --> 51:08.466
During the last half of the fan, it began to scroll uncontrollably.

51:09.087 --> 51:13.732
And so I wrote it, the last half of that book, with the screen going like this.

51:14.493 --> 51:16.235
Are you being stubborn here?

51:16.836 --> 51:17.196
Well, no.

51:18.497 --> 51:19.939
A laptop is coming on Friday.

51:19.999 --> 51:22.262
Diana finally said, you know, you jerk.

51:23.623 --> 51:24.344
And she ordered it.

51:25.705 --> 51:32.513
You should get yourself a nice big hard disk with a very fast... That's what we're getting.

51:32.593 --> 51:35.196
I'm going to have to set up with this laptop.

51:35.513 --> 51:46.484
but also a big monitor and a real keyboard so that I can work up there in a non-portable situation or take it if I want to.

51:47.905 --> 51:50.248
What kind of software do you use?

51:50.348 --> 51:59.557
What I use now is something that... I just know that they give the model number.

51:59.677 --> 52:02.060
I think it's a one point something.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.521
One DOS, right?

52:03.541 --> 52:04.442
It's not even DOS.

52:04.522 --> 52:05.503
It's CPM.

52:05.922 --> 52:07.083
It's not even Doc.

52:07.143 --> 52:20.238
See, for the screenplay I thought, and also with his scrolling it's really hard on my eyes.

52:20.438 --> 52:21.379
Do you do much revision?

52:21.399 --> 52:23.361
Are you a reviser?

52:23.381 --> 52:24.062
No, I'm not.

52:24.382 --> 52:25.484
One draft?

52:25.604 --> 52:26.104
Pretty much.

52:26.144 --> 52:33.212
But see I have a number, one of my, I have my own little rules too.

52:33.800 --> 52:37.505
go on to the next sentence until I'm satisfied with the one that went before.

52:37.525 --> 52:40.209
And I don't go on to the next paragraph until I'm happy with it.

52:40.229 --> 52:42.913
And then when I get to each chapter, I go over it right there.

52:43.654 --> 52:46.618
So at the end, I don't have much to do.

52:46.718 --> 52:48.861
And when I do, I don't cut.

52:50.082 --> 52:51.264
So it's constant revision.

52:51.685 --> 52:53.848
It's constant revision, but at the end, it's done.

52:54.248 --> 52:55.710
And I'm not a cutter either.

52:55.790 --> 52:59.075
In fact, I just understood this the other day.

52:59.135 --> 53:01.478
I suppose deep down, I'm sort of a romantic.

53:01.846 --> 53:05.151
But my working method is as a minimalist.

53:05.831 --> 53:09.677
So in fact what I find is, at the end I add.

53:10.798 --> 53:19.230
On that sort of swipe through the little slot, the last one is I add stuff, you know.

53:20.011 --> 53:22.554
That's a good quote.

53:22.574 --> 53:28.883
Do you have a sense of who you read or who you write for?

53:29.808 --> 53:30.669
I really don't.

53:30.689 --> 53:31.490
Is there a male reader?

53:31.850 --> 53:32.731
Oh, no.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.313
Either.

53:35.414 --> 53:39.578
Yeah, I don't think in... Just readers would like a good story.

53:39.618 --> 53:47.547
I don't... I mean, you've really got the suspense thing down.

53:47.567 --> 53:49.169
Yeah, it is suspense fiction.

53:49.189 --> 53:50.270
I mean, or crime fiction.

53:50.410 --> 53:54.354
But I'd hope that anyone who likes a good story would like it.

53:54.394 --> 53:58.819
I don't want to exclude... I don't see anything in it that would exclude any type of reader.

54:04.469 --> 54:05.911
I've read P.W.

54:05.931 --> 54:06.892
Gideon Stern.

54:06.912 --> 54:07.433
Yeah.

54:07.793 --> 54:08.294
Home writing.

54:08.434 --> 54:09.556
Knocks it out of the park.

54:10.196 --> 54:10.417
Yeah.

54:10.617 --> 54:10.697
Yes.

54:11.338 --> 54:13.721
It's the... The signs are... Yeah.

54:13.801 --> 54:18.487
I mean, they... You name your two sons.

54:18.547 --> 54:19.649
You have four kids.

54:19.669 --> 54:19.849
Yeah.

54:19.869 --> 54:20.730
They're Seth.

54:20.750 --> 54:22.312
How do I actually give us all of them?

54:22.332 --> 54:22.432
Okay.

54:22.452 --> 54:23.354
Seth's 15.

54:23.494 --> 54:24.395
Ben is 12.

54:24.495 --> 54:25.256
Lily is 10.

54:25.316 --> 54:27.078
And Rosie is... Lily's 1L.

54:27.098 --> 54:29.442
Lily's 1L is 10.

54:29.482 --> 54:30.643
And Rosie is 5.

54:31.104 --> 54:31.945
R-O-S.

54:31.965 --> 54:32.365
I-E.

54:32.385 --> 54:32.846
I-E.

54:32.866 --> 54:34.408
And so your wife...

54:34.743 --> 54:53.050
Diana, D-I-A-N-A, and she uses her real name, I mean her name, Gray, G-R-A-Y, and the kids are hyphenated, Abrahams hyphen Gray, and at the school they're usually Gray, you know, they simplify it.

54:53.070 --> 54:53.210
Really?

54:53.230 --> 54:53.451
Yeah, yeah.

54:53.471 --> 54:53.711
That's cool.

54:53.731 --> 54:59.840
So, well, I guess, I mean, this shows... You've got to recap it with the computers and stuff.

55:00.020 --> 55:02.404
Oh, no, yeah, and if you take them to the doctor,

55:02.519 --> 55:06.505
You know, if you go to the hospital and they always look you up, well, is it Gray, is it Abraham's?

55:06.525 --> 55:09.669
I mean, you know, we can never, can't remember what we told them that time.

55:09.689 --> 55:11.732
We can never really find them in the computer.

55:12.653 --> 55:13.094
I don't know.

55:13.114 --> 55:15.477
We, I mean, maybe it's a dated thing.

55:15.558 --> 55:19.683
I mean, when we got married and everything, lots of people were doing that.

55:19.704 --> 55:23.229
I guess it doesn't sort of happen anymore.

55:23.249 --> 55:24.210
Whatever you're comfortable with.

55:24.230 --> 55:24.470
Yeah.

55:24.490 --> 55:25.752
Oh, no, I'm comfortable with it.

55:25.772 --> 55:28.476
You know, of course, when they, if they go out and marry people the same thing,

55:28.962 --> 55:30.664
generations who are also hyphenated.

55:30.684 --> 55:34.248
Extremely complex names.

55:34.268 --> 55:39.034
Like very old European aristocrats, which we're not.

55:39.054 --> 55:41.557
Have I missed anything, Claudia, I should ask, Peter?

55:44.060 --> 55:49.766
Yeah, it's like an hour.

55:49.846 --> 55:56.834
Well, you know, if there's anything... Maybe you'll give me your phone number, and if you have questions, I can give you a call.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.176
It's 508...

55:58.527 --> 55:58.829
508.

55:58.869 --> 56:02.327
540-6703.

56:02.387 --> 56:03.412
Okay, good.

56:03.774 --> 56:04.960
Excellent.
