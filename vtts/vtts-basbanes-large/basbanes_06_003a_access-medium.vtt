00:02.545 --> 00:26.439
We had a bookstore and theater together to go back to about 1967 or 8, I guess.

00:26.940 --> 00:27.580
And where was that?

00:27.600 --> 00:31.506
It was in La Jolla, and it was an art film theater.

00:31.621 --> 00:36.726
Repertory Film Theater and a bookstore.

00:37.446 --> 00:51.939
And out of, really, my husband's collecting books and our realization that the old illustrated books were essentially out of everybody's knowledge.

00:51.979 --> 00:55.242
I mean, they were out of print and rare and not being reprinted or anything.

00:55.943 --> 00:59.586
And some of the great illustrators of the past, Rackham and so forth, were just

00:59.802 --> 01:02.245
basically unknown to all except a few antiquarians.

01:02.785 --> 01:09.793
We started the Green Tiger Press, which originally started with reproducing old illustrations out of our collection.

01:11.575 --> 01:13.717
Collection of what, specifically?

01:13.737 --> 01:14.859
Of illustrated books.

01:14.879 --> 01:15.439
Illustrated books.

01:15.980 --> 01:19.744
And then it went from there.

01:20.044 --> 01:27.953
The first book we published was a book by my husband about children's illustrations.

01:28.912 --> 01:33.958
or illustrations in children's books, and called All Mirrors or Magic Mirrors.

01:33.978 --> 01:51.598
And then we printed, we did reprints all the way through the Green Tigress history, and then we started doing modern illustrators with modern stories.

01:51.618 --> 01:55.222
Let me just shift this off for a second.

01:55.242 --> 01:55.943
How's your husband's name?

01:56.443 --> 01:56.804
Harold.

01:56.964 --> 01:57.405
Harold.

01:57.425 --> 01:57.805
Harold.

01:58.004 --> 02:00.247
And you're both Californians?

02:00.267 --> 02:03.410
Well, no, I'm from Cincinnati.

02:03.891 --> 02:08.656
And he was born in New London, but his father was in the Navy.

02:08.677 --> 02:09.718
New London, Connecticut.

02:09.838 --> 02:14.423
Yeah, but his father was in the Navy, and so he traveled so much as he traveled.

02:14.443 --> 02:16.786
He doesn't really consider himself almost from anywhere.

02:17.146 --> 02:20.210
But then his father retired to San Diego, which is how he got there.

02:20.230 --> 02:21.572
A lot of Navy people do.

02:21.592 --> 02:22.353
That's right.

02:22.393 --> 02:25.376
He liked the climate, and he liked the town at the time.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.859
It's gotten a little changed a little bit since then.

02:28.025 --> 02:36.016
And I was out there visiting and met him and stayed about 25 years ago.

02:37.157 --> 02:43.967
And so anyway, the Green Tiger Press was really born out of my interest in training as a painter.

02:45.388 --> 02:47.832
I come from a family of a lot of painters.

02:47.932 --> 02:56.884
I counted the other day, I think I've got nine relatives from my grandfather's generation down who worked.

02:57.775 --> 03:06.825
professional in the art field, all the way down to my sister, who's a successful artist in Canada.

03:06.845 --> 03:10.789
When we're done with this last week, I collect a lot of illustrated things, too.

03:10.809 --> 03:17.776
I'd love to talk to you about a few of the things that I collect, but not right now.

03:18.017 --> 03:22.922
You say you started collecting, I gather, with

03:23.341 --> 03:28.126
Yeah, Harold is really the collector.

03:28.146 --> 03:30.489
Harold is more of a utilitarian stretch.

03:30.509 --> 03:31.910
Right, that's been my approach.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.713
Some of us, of course, rubbed off on me after all this time.

03:34.753 --> 03:36.615
I mean, it rubbed off on our children, too.

03:36.815 --> 03:39.719
Our house is out of hand.

03:42.221 --> 03:45.765
So I collect to some extent for the sake of having a collection.

03:45.785 --> 03:52.352
But as I say, my collections tend to be around things of interest.

03:52.568 --> 03:58.395
He has really done the major part of the collecting that was the Green Tigers and is now ours.

03:59.276 --> 04:06.385
And I think it's quite a major children's book collection.

04:06.405 --> 04:12.813
There are some, we say children's and illustrated because we do have books which aren't really for children.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.837
I mean, Doré and people, you know, something like that.

04:15.877 --> 04:17.879
But certainly the emphasis is children.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.501
That's very interesting.

04:19.882 --> 04:21.664
Children's books were never collected.

04:21.931 --> 04:23.253
by serious collectors.

04:23.493 --> 04:24.354
That's right.

04:24.394 --> 04:24.875
They weren't.

04:25.857 --> 04:33.928
You go to the Bodleian at Oxford, for instance, and that's why they're so thrilled to get the Opie collection, because they never did books, I mean children's books.

04:34.188 --> 04:34.609
Right.

04:34.970 --> 04:39.155
They were never considered serious enough.

04:39.175 --> 04:40.017
That's right.

04:40.097 --> 04:42.961
Or the Osborne collection up in Toronto.

04:42.981 --> 04:48.489
That's right, and there are major collections like that, and of course, Library of Congress has a good collection.

04:48.609 --> 04:50.772
AAS here in Worcester has an exception.

04:50.792 --> 04:51.533
Do they?

04:52.171 --> 04:55.694
Markets, of course, in contendence number one.

04:55.714 --> 04:55.854
Uh-huh.

04:55.874 --> 05:02.340
Uh, we should be, we should... Yeah, we, we... But we had books that... You'll have to give me a card before we go on.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.762
Maybe I'll even measure something.

05:03.782 --> 05:04.182
Oh, good.

05:04.322 --> 05:10.008
Oh, I'd like to, uh... Make sure you know who I am at some point.

05:10.028 --> 05:14.252
Um, but, uh, we, my, we were in London last year.

05:14.272 --> 05:19.056
We were there for a month last fall, and he was doing research in the, um,

05:20.251 --> 05:22.934
British Library, and we have books they don't have.

05:23.855 --> 05:25.997
You as individuals?

05:26.037 --> 05:26.938
Yeah.

05:26.958 --> 05:28.600
I mean, they have books we don't have, too.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.502
Well, they have the British Library.

05:30.562 --> 05:30.802
Right.

05:30.822 --> 05:32.324
And they've been at it since it's 1755.

05:32.444 --> 05:32.925
That's right.

05:32.945 --> 05:38.170
And I think that Harold found that he had some books the Library of Congress didn't have.

05:38.631 --> 05:44.217
One of the things that he's always specialized in, one of the things about children's books is that they are

05:44.551 --> 05:45.572
of their nature.

05:45.612 --> 05:48.635
I mean, not counting the coffee table books like Dulac and Rackham.

05:48.695 --> 05:49.816
Everybody knows about that.

05:49.856 --> 05:50.677
They are ephemeral.

05:51.097 --> 05:53.139
Is that what you were going to say?

05:53.159 --> 05:54.520
Yeah, they are ephemeral.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.322
No, that's fine.

05:57.283 --> 06:04.690
Also, they tend to be... There's a much larger proportion... Well, I don't know.

06:04.730 --> 06:13.798
I probably don't know other fields as well, but there tend to be all kinds of books, one book by a person.

06:14.133 --> 06:16.156
Somebody did it for their children, right?

06:16.236 --> 06:19.421
And I don't know how they got it printed, but you never heard of this person.

06:19.661 --> 06:21.845
A great example is Alice in Wonderland.

06:22.366 --> 06:23.868
Well, yeah, that's true.

06:23.888 --> 06:26.031
How many episodes did he do other than through the looking glass?

06:26.171 --> 06:27.053
Well, that's true.

06:27.514 --> 06:38.250
But there are things by Mrs. George Banbury, you know, did this thing for her child who was sick or an adult illustrator.

06:38.517 --> 06:43.482
a newspaper illustrator or a magazine illustrator or something, they do one book.

06:43.502 --> 06:44.563
So they unique appearances.

06:44.583 --> 06:45.244
Right.

06:45.344 --> 06:49.628
And they don't appear in bibliographies because they're, who knows about it?

06:49.728 --> 06:51.470
Are they important, though?

06:51.490 --> 07:03.122
Well, we've specialized in those odd little things, painting books, how-to-do-it books, little odd things that really were kind of ephemeral in their time.

07:04.283 --> 07:08.187
The Chicago Tribune, who's the Chicago Tribune?

07:08.521 --> 07:15.651
Bradley, the name of Bradley, did one book called Our Indians.

07:15.671 --> 07:17.834
He did it for his children.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.316
Ben Allen from Chicago, not the guy from Chicago.

07:19.376 --> 07:22.421
No, what's his first name?

07:22.441 --> 07:23.983
I've got a wrong name.

07:24.063 --> 07:27.248
Anyway, he did one book called Our Indians.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.049
Our Indians.

07:28.069 --> 07:29.291
Our Indians, yeah.

07:29.311 --> 07:30.773
And that's it.

07:31.133 --> 07:31.774
That's all he ever did.

07:31.814 --> 07:33.757
It wasn't his profession.

07:33.777 --> 07:34.698
But he did a nice book.

07:34.718 --> 07:35.279
Beautiful.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.621
Absolutely beautiful.

07:36.820 --> 07:37.761
Who published now?

07:37.861 --> 07:39.423
Is this a self-published deal?

07:39.503 --> 07:41.386
No, it wasn't self-published.

07:41.406 --> 07:42.547
It was professionally done.

07:43.428 --> 07:49.535
We found out about it because the granddaughter, no, the niece.

07:49.616 --> 07:56.284
I want to put this close to you just because I know this television is competing with you if it's close to you or it's not.

07:56.524 --> 07:57.445
Bradley's niece.

07:57.914 --> 08:01.638
was in a retirement home in La Jolla.

08:01.759 --> 08:05.643
And somehow or other, somebody told her about us or us about her or something.

08:06.004 --> 08:10.208
We went to see her, and she had the original sketchbook of the thing.

08:10.509 --> 08:12.872
We actually had the book, as a matter of fact.

08:13.192 --> 08:24.225
And she had the original sketchbook, and we actually reproduced the whole thing in small in a book we did at the Green Tiger called Image and Maker.

08:24.847 --> 08:30.656
which we intended to have it be an ongoing thing, but we never got around to doing the second one.

08:30.676 --> 08:34.442
We sold the Green Tiger in 86, and it was kind of a labor of love.

08:34.462 --> 08:35.543
I mean, it was a beautiful book.

08:35.563 --> 08:38.548
It had 26-pit plates and things like that.

08:39.149 --> 08:41.813
It was, again, about illustration.

08:42.274 --> 08:42.574
Yeah.

08:42.594 --> 08:44.577
Are any of these in print?

08:45.113 --> 08:48.136
You'd have trouble finding that one.

08:48.457 --> 08:49.298
It's not in France.

08:49.678 --> 08:53.502
Green Tire might have one knocking around, but I doubt it.

08:53.722 --> 08:54.463
Image and Maker.

08:55.584 --> 08:56.285
It's a beautiful book.

08:56.305 --> 08:57.126
It's about this big.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.608
Maybe it's more than 27.

08:58.988 --> 08:59.709
I can't remember.

08:59.729 --> 09:00.850
It's a tall.

09:00.910 --> 09:06.676
You guys didn't do things like what I call manufactured rarity.

09:06.696 --> 09:07.537
I mean, these things weren't.

09:07.557 --> 09:09.800
Did you have a limitation on them on the outset?

09:10.080 --> 09:10.981
No, no, no.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.943
We never did limited dishes.

09:13.784 --> 09:14.685
I deplore that.

09:14.705 --> 09:15.086
No.

09:15.246 --> 09:24.057
Because the whole concept of being a writer or an author is to put things in the marketplace.

09:26.340 --> 09:27.041
Well, yeah.

09:27.061 --> 09:28.363
I mean, I guess that there are.

09:28.603 --> 09:37.375
I mean, I can't really quarrel with the people who go make these handmade books out of, you know, three colors of paper and die cut and punch the pages and all that stuff.

09:37.395 --> 09:38.296
That's a whole different thing.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.260
It's a limited edition process.

09:41.290 --> 09:47.378
are not really making... I mean, they're making something else, and I guess they're a perfect right to do that.

09:47.658 --> 09:50.402
We were never... We always considered ourselves trade publishers, though.

09:51.343 --> 09:52.524
And... I love that, yeah.

09:52.544 --> 09:53.746
We did very well with it.

09:54.427 --> 09:59.033
Frankly, we never had... We never had books that didn't make us money back.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.555
That's wonderful.

10:00.575 --> 10:02.457
We... It took us a while.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.559
You marketed yourself?

10:03.599 --> 10:04.340
You did it yourself?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.282
There's a lot of reason we gave up on the whole thing.

10:06.302 --> 10:10.808
It got so monstrous, you know, distributing and everything that...

10:11.041 --> 10:11.942
We got sick of it.

10:12.002 --> 10:23.019
We were spending all our time on the marketing end and getting nothing and not having any, marketing and financing, not having any time for the creative part that we really liked.

10:24.200 --> 10:30.229
So, but, I mean, some additions like this had all this hand tipping, which we did ourselves.

10:30.710 --> 10:31.752
We hand tipped cards.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.036
We had a large hand manufacturing establishment there.

10:35.878 --> 10:40.845
And originally we hand tipped the cards because the books were that way.

10:41.078 --> 10:42.780
do this the way they were supposed to be done.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.162
So we had note cards that were just gone.

10:45.762 --> 10:47.304
Did to the end of the Green Tiger.

10:48.265 --> 10:50.787
And so we hit books.

10:50.887 --> 10:54.651
I mean, Image and Maker, I think we only printed 2,500 of it.

10:55.411 --> 10:57.193
But it was going to be ongoing.

10:57.213 --> 10:59.555
It had articles by various four or five people.

10:59.575 --> 11:08.824
It was edited by my husband and a friend of ours who's a professor of English at San Diego State, Peter Newmeyer, who's a writer and a professor.

11:09.563 --> 11:12.448
specializing in children's illustrations.

11:12.468 --> 11:15.372
Anyway, they edited, and they were going to go on and do more, but I don't know.

11:15.392 --> 11:18.898
It never happened in May again, though, because it was a wonderful project.

11:20.681 --> 11:29.275
Anyway, we'd only printed, say, 2,500 of that one, whereas we'd print 10,000 of something else, and we had our own press.

11:30.376 --> 11:34.703
So we could— These were all hand-pressed things, isn't it?

11:34.723 --> 11:35.645
They weren't hand-pressed.

11:35.665 --> 11:37.107
It was a two-color Heidelberg.

11:37.829 --> 11:41.252
We did the whole thing.

11:41.293 --> 11:44.456
I mean, partly because, frankly, we were stuck out there in San Diego.

11:44.476 --> 11:46.538
You did 10,000 books of a run, of a book.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.182
Sure, Heidelberg can do 10,000 impressions an hour.

11:50.222 --> 11:52.664
I mean, you get it rolling.

11:53.485 --> 11:55.267
How do you spell that?

11:55.367 --> 11:55.907
Heidelberg.

11:55.988 --> 11:56.608
Oh, Heidelberg.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.650
Heidelberg, a Heidelberg press.

11:58.670 --> 12:01.273
And I was a press foreman.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.695
Heidelberg, just like the town, yeah.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.279
H-E-I-D-E-L-B-E-R-G, right?

12:07.647 --> 12:09.870
Yeah, I think you got it right there.

12:11.913 --> 12:14.137
But we did the whole thing.

12:14.217 --> 12:19.605
I mean, we did the books from, we didn't do our color separation, and we didn't do our own binding.

12:20.446 --> 12:23.351
So we did some hand binding of certain kinds.

12:23.931 --> 12:31.663
But other than that, we did pre-press, we did photography, we did the design, layout, paste-up.

12:32.217 --> 12:33.598
How many years did you do this?

12:33.818 --> 12:35.079
Eleven, I guess?

12:35.180 --> 12:36.461
No, it was about fifteen.

12:36.521 --> 12:39.243
I started about seventy, and we sold it in eighty-six.

12:41.445 --> 12:41.885
Seventy to eighty-six.

12:41.905 --> 12:43.286
And how did you get the name Green Tiger?

12:44.247 --> 12:48.431
Well, he's a merry-go-round tiger.

12:50.653 --> 12:53.475
We always thought of him as a merry-go-round tiger.

12:53.495 --> 12:53.715
Okay.

12:53.735 --> 12:58.139
Yeah, so he's fanciful, and so he could be green as well as anything else.

12:58.419 --> 13:01.482
But he's your creation, your combined creation.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.202
Yeah, yeah.

13:03.884 --> 13:04.525
What do you mean?

13:04.545 --> 13:06.148
You mean the logo itself or the idea?

13:06.208 --> 13:06.789
Or the idea?

13:07.169 --> 13:12.118
Yeah, it also a little bit comes from the fact that my husband's a lifelong tiger fan.

13:12.138 --> 13:13.721
These important things.

13:13.741 --> 13:16.065
You know, these things, you know, they all go.

13:16.105 --> 13:23.499
And besides, we like the color because it gives you lots of opportunities for design and recognition.

13:23.519 --> 13:26.524
And we like the idea of a carousel animal.

13:26.993 --> 13:29.378
And then the tiger seemed like a good one.

13:29.478 --> 13:31.822
Did you draw the cauliflower?

13:32.123 --> 13:32.524
Oh, yeah.

13:32.544 --> 13:33.926
Well, he was drawn many times.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.690
There were many different ones.

13:35.730 --> 13:46.791
We used one by a tiger at one point that was, well, it was a variation of one that had been created by Richard from the illustrator.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.002
But there were many.

13:48.683 --> 13:51.647
It seems to me to tell him something important.

13:51.767 --> 13:52.968
Well, I don't know.

13:52.988 --> 13:54.470
We did it as far as the collecting.

13:54.791 --> 14:02.560
We just did a book, well, it's been two or three years now, I guess, for Abbeville called Clapperjack.

14:04.483 --> 14:10.090
And it's really the, I mean, as a matter of fact, Harold wrote it.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.112
The author on the title is Alec Caramillo.

14:12.533 --> 14:13.414
And it's his collection.

14:13.434 --> 14:14.696
He lives in Fontana.

14:14.736 --> 14:15.917
What's his name?

14:16.302 --> 14:19.527
J-A-R-A-M-I-L-L-O.

14:20.309 --> 14:21.791
And what kind of a collection is it?

14:21.811 --> 14:23.434
It's a crackerjack toy.

14:23.454 --> 14:25.036
It's a crackerjack toy.

14:25.056 --> 14:26.479
I remember that book.

14:26.499 --> 14:26.679
Right.

14:26.819 --> 14:27.741
It's crackerjack toys.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.343
Well, that's really our book.

14:29.684 --> 14:31.206
We went and found him.

14:31.667 --> 14:39.660
We went and photographed the collection, and he read things into the tape, and then held

14:40.265 --> 14:44.471
really wrote the thing, but it's his ideas, you know.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.915
But anyway, that's, it's his collection.

14:48.777 --> 14:51.021
It was hell photographing in Fontana, I can tell you.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.242
Did you deal with Bob Abrams in that?

14:52.663 --> 14:53.845
I hate to be Bob for my book.

14:54.345 --> 15:03.298
No, our editor was, um, I'm not good on names this morning, uh, Walton Rawls.

15:04.761 --> 15:07.825
He's, because it's a nine by nine, the nine by nine are his series.

15:08.193 --> 15:21.232
And we did a second one from them, which is also a collection of ours, held it under his own name, called Bon Voyage, which is about the ephemera of travel.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.055
It's a lovely book, I don't know.

15:23.295 --> 15:25.038
Yeah, it is a nice book.

15:26.340 --> 15:31.707
It has done very well.

15:31.727 --> 15:34.892
I could edit it a little, I'll admit that, but...

15:35.395 --> 15:38.479
It was a good-sized book, as I recollect.

15:38.499 --> 15:40.002
Well, it's one of the nine-by-nines.

15:40.542 --> 15:45.449
We wanted it—the idea for—we were originally going to do it at the Green Tiger.

15:45.589 --> 15:48.233
Then we sold it, and the owner didn't want to do it.

15:48.634 --> 15:51.938
What we wanted to do was have luggage labels with it.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.644
So when you've got your book, you've got a bunch of luggage labels.

15:56.104 --> 16:00.070
But they said they were, but they backed out, and then went through.

16:00.387 --> 16:02.789
a little label on there, a little tag.

16:03.210 --> 16:04.251
So we're going to do it ourselves.

16:04.511 --> 16:09.697
We're going to publish, and in fact, we're going to start publishing again, and we're going to start with two things.

16:09.837 --> 16:18.226
One is the box, the luggage labels, and a booklet about travel that should have been with the original book.

16:18.246 --> 16:19.367
What's the name of the new press?

16:19.387 --> 16:21.369
I think it's from the Dreamers.

16:22.230 --> 16:22.990
Yes.

16:23.011 --> 16:25.433
And the other thing we're going to do is

16:25.868 --> 16:34.622
a group of envelopes, marvelous envelopes by a man, a friend of ours, and a marvelous artist, graphic artist.

16:34.642 --> 16:36.084
They're decorated envelopes.

16:36.284 --> 16:37.546
He's been doing this for years.

16:37.666 --> 16:44.497
He sends these things to everybody.

16:44.577 --> 16:46.660
He sends mailings, and they're wonderful.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.563
He also sends crazy things to the mail.

16:48.884 --> 16:52.970
He's a teacher at the University of Washington, Seattle, and it got to be a game with his students.

16:53.491 --> 16:54.272
They would send

16:54.725 --> 17:21.255
candy bars and records and motors and and um cutouts and all kinds of things see what they could get through the mail and that you can get almost anything through the mail i mean he doesn't send anything dangerous with knives or anything like that but he gets you can get almost anything through the mail it's like he told us a funny story about one um that he sent to his agent and he put a magnet on the back so she could put it on her refrigerator

17:21.370 --> 17:25.095
And when he dropped it in, he heard it go thunk.

17:26.036 --> 17:27.838
He thought, that will never get there.

17:28.259 --> 17:28.800
But it did.

17:30.121 --> 17:35.208
He scraped it off the inside of him, apparently, and passed it along.

17:35.228 --> 17:40.394
It was very advantageous to have gone from book selling into publishing.

17:40.775 --> 17:48.745
It really gave us a world, both because of our temperament and because we were out there on the West Coast away from the publishing world,

17:48.927 --> 17:52.390
We're really self-taught for ourselves by our bootstraps.

17:52.410 --> 17:54.932
I mean, we did everything for ourselves.

17:54.992 --> 17:59.316
Nothing invented the wheel all over again in many ways.

17:59.937 --> 18:01.478
And I'm very glad of it.

18:01.558 --> 18:16.572
As I say, one thing coming from the book business, in the book store business, which isn't exactly that, but gives you a very valuable insight into the bookseller's problems and into what it's like out there and what customers are like.

18:16.889 --> 18:20.200
Unlike what salesmen are like, what customers are really like.

18:20.702 --> 18:21.545
That's very valuable.

18:21.846 --> 18:25.719
And I wouldn't trade for anything, all the production experience I had.

18:25.759 --> 18:27.344
I mean, I was a press foreman.

18:27.425 --> 18:28.468
I'm...

18:29.039 --> 18:47.858
beginning to forget it but i could tell you you know okay you better turn up the third roller there and it looks like you're getting a little so-and-so and more water on the sessions because i had to we didn't have enough money to hire a production manager get in there and learn it you know about 80 hours a week well yeah

18:48.108 --> 18:51.512
You know, push comes to shove, I can strip a colored job.

18:51.532 --> 18:52.414
That's a great line.

18:54.596 --> 18:57.220
If you keep your press, does that go up behind the window?

18:57.240 --> 18:58.081
Don't quote me on that.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.022
That sounds too silly.

18:59.323 --> 19:00.504
What sounds too silly?

19:00.524 --> 19:02.687
Push comes to shove, I can strip a colored job.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.108
That's wonderful.

19:03.128 --> 19:06.772
Well, I know, but... Do you want me not to... I love the quote.

19:07.273 --> 19:11.158
I'd rather you didn't, because it's really an idle boast in a way.

19:11.178 --> 19:14.082
It's a very technical job.

19:14.062 --> 19:22.073
You know, if I got stuck late at night, I could go fix something, but, you know, I'm not really a color stripper, so I shouldn't say that.

19:22.093 --> 19:23.495
Which comes to shove, you said.

19:24.016 --> 19:27.020
I could strip a piece of color, maybe.

19:27.200 --> 19:27.581
Okay.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.322
You said it's a big head.

19:28.822 --> 19:29.163
Anyway.

19:30.765 --> 19:32.147
With a small point.

19:32.167 --> 19:32.527
Anyhow.

19:32.547 --> 19:43.242
But I think all that experience was absolutely invaluable, and having our own camera down there and understanding the problems with stripping and photography and so forth,

19:43.610 --> 19:45.813
It teaches you what you can ask for.

19:45.873 --> 19:47.134
It teaches you what you can get.

19:47.475 --> 19:49.117
It teaches you how you can get it.

19:49.137 --> 19:52.140
I mean, technology is getting a little ahead of me sometimes.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.906
I'm a little behind nowadays, but I haven't done it for a while.

19:57.206 --> 19:58.167
This is a great story.

19:58.287 --> 20:00.170
Let's get over to this now a little bit.

20:00.190 --> 20:05.476
But anyway, it isn't altogether irrelevant to this because... It's not irrelevant.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.520
It's not irrelevant to it because... We're talking about the Carl books.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.100
The Carl books.

20:09.220 --> 20:11.423
In fact, all the illustrated books do...

20:12.230 --> 20:19.441
come out of a love of the tradition of children's books and the long collecting of it.

20:19.861 --> 20:25.589
I think the... That's a wonderful quote.

20:25.609 --> 20:25.810
Thank you.

20:25.830 --> 20:26.831
I already see it in type.

20:26.951 --> 20:27.292
Okay.

20:27.753 --> 20:29.295
You should be careful with your journal.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.660
You open your mouth and something comes out and you see a friend that looks so stupid.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.421
But I warn people.

20:33.521 --> 20:35.945
I get so excited.

20:36.786 --> 20:37.647
Anyway.

20:38.318 --> 20:41.961
All the books come out of... They come out of a long, yeah.

20:42.182 --> 20:43.243
A long tradition.

20:43.523 --> 20:48.387
A tradition of, yeah, a love of the old books and the studying of them and collecting of them.

20:48.728 --> 20:54.493
So, really, my... Can I interrupt?

20:54.513 --> 20:55.214
Yeah, sure.

20:55.234 --> 20:57.155
Are these throwbacks?

20:57.175 --> 20:59.177
Conceptually?

20:59.197 --> 21:00.318
I don't know.

21:01.079 --> 21:02.761
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.122
Are they reactionary?

21:04.162 --> 21:04.823
No, no, no, no.

21:04.843 --> 21:06.764
Throwbacks to an earlier era.

21:06.804 --> 21:07.465
They evolved...

21:08.373 --> 21:09.256
Maybe they do.

21:09.276 --> 21:10.961
I don't do it on purpose.

21:11.643 --> 21:20.610
People have said that... Somebody said about something that the book looked like it was set in the 40s, which...

21:20.843 --> 21:22.625
I certainly didn't intend.

21:23.066 --> 21:24.728
I don't know if it does or not.

21:25.049 --> 21:28.273
I try to get things to be sort of universal.

21:28.333 --> 21:39.768
I certainly don't want to be having illustrations that children can't feel are them, so I don't want them to seem antiquated.

21:40.249 --> 21:47.458
I suppose, to some extent, all illustrators tend to illustrate their own childhood.

21:48.367 --> 22:11.758
but um because it's what childhood is see you know it's hard to escape from that and um but i certainly don't i certainly am not consciously reactionary uh you did say and i interrupted but that's because i wanted to ask that question then but you were saying that all the books

22:12.835 --> 22:17.380
came out or grew out of a long tradition of the old books.

22:17.400 --> 22:24.007
Yes, studying them and thinking about them and looking at them.

22:24.027 --> 22:37.300
As I said, I've never intended to indicate or be reactionary, but as some people are, as some people are, I mean, Kate Greenaway was.

22:37.921 --> 22:41.745
She said, you know, her children are

22:42.333 --> 22:46.481
75 years, dressed 75 years earlier than her own period.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.326
She was deliberately reactionary.

22:49.346 --> 22:50.648
And there are people like that.

22:50.689 --> 22:52.091
I'm not attempting to be that.

22:52.712 --> 22:57.962
I'm attempting to be just sort of anytime.

22:58.381 --> 23:05.571
but certainly current enough to seem accessible to children and to people nowadays.

23:05.591 --> 23:08.114
I mean, I'm not trying to be nostalgic, put it that way.

23:09.737 --> 23:19.470
Certain things that I like, I mean, if I've got a choice, I'll picture an old telephone booth and not a new one, just because I've had enough.

23:19.490 --> 23:20.692
Do you like some juice or something?

23:21.453 --> 23:23.015
I would like some juice.

23:24.257 --> 23:26.059
What kind of fruit juice do you have?

23:26.208 --> 23:44.293
I'll pick things that I like the look of better.

23:45.454 --> 23:52.143
I'll pick things that I like the look of an older thing.

23:52.784 --> 23:54.747
I'll pick them, but I try not to get it...

23:55.334 --> 23:56.635
out of experience.

23:56.835 --> 24:13.032
I'm not going to pick up a post box from the 19th century to show that, but if I've got a choice between a better looking old thing and a worse looking new thing, I'll certainly take the old thing, but it's really on the grounds of looks and not on the grounds of trying to be reactionary.

24:13.832 --> 24:18.377
As a matter of fact, usually things are getting, things tend to be getting worse.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.599
You see, the only reason I ask that question is,

24:20.950 --> 24:24.435
The question was basically a response to what you were saying.

24:24.736 --> 24:32.067
And again, we'll get back to Carl, how Carl grew out of the collecting and the... It did.

24:32.167 --> 24:37.895
Well, Carl very specifically did, because the idea from Carl came from a Münchner Bilderbogen.

24:38.496 --> 24:39.358
Came from what, I'm sorry?

24:39.378 --> 24:43.123
A Münchner Bilderbogen, which is... Can you spell it for Annette?

24:43.304 --> 24:47.189
Yeah, M-U with an umlaut, M-G-H.

24:47.570 --> 24:47.650
Yep.

24:48.305 --> 24:49.086
M-U-N-C-H.

24:49.667 --> 24:50.208
M-U-N-C-H.

24:50.288 --> 24:51.270
M-U-N-C-H.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.092
M-U-N-C-H.

24:53.453 --> 24:53.954
M-U-N-C-H.

24:55.857 --> 24:56.217
M-U-N-C-H.

24:56.798 --> 24:57.139
M-U-N-C-H.

24:57.159 --> 24:57.539
M-U-N-C-H.

24:58.761 --> 24:59.442
M-U-N-C-H.

25:00.143 --> 25:00.924
M-U-N-C-H.

25:01.425 --> 25:02.086
M-U-N-C-H.

25:02.126 --> 25:02.927
M-U-N-C-H.

25:03.308 --> 25:03.669
M-U-N-C-H.

25:03.689 --> 25:04.270
M-U-N-C-H.

25:04.971 --> 25:05.171
M-U-N-C-H.

25:05.311 --> 25:06.653
M-U-N-C-H.

25:06.813 --> 25:07.434
M-U-N-C-H.

25:07.715 --> 25:08.476
M-U-N-C-H.

25:08.496 --> 25:09.237
M-U-N-C-H.

25:09.277 --> 25:09.758
M-U-N-C-H.

25:09.778 --> 25:10.719
M-U-N-C-H.

25:11.240 --> 25:11.601
M-U-N-C-H.

25:11.701 --> 25:11.781
M-U-

25:12.436 --> 25:13.097
Sheets.

25:13.477 --> 25:13.978
Sheets.

25:14.318 --> 25:15.800
Picture, sheet, paper, yeah.

25:15.820 --> 25:16.962
Well, that's a phrase.

25:16.982 --> 25:20.667
And they, Munich had them, Berlin had them.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.169
From what period?

25:22.189 --> 25:23.430
End of the 19th century.

25:24.211 --> 25:26.775
Started about 1840 or 50.

25:27.215 --> 25:28.517
But they had them in London, too.

25:28.837 --> 25:32.903
And they were called... Were they colored?

25:32.983 --> 25:34.064
Well, we called broadsheets.

25:34.084 --> 25:39.692
They were one color, one penny, one penny flame, tuppence colored.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.375
And their colors were usually hand colored.

25:42.997 --> 25:47.125
either really by hand or by some kind of pochoir process.

25:47.145 --> 25:47.746
How do you spell that?

25:48.427 --> 25:49.088
That's French.

25:49.149 --> 25:49.870
I'm not sure.

25:50.030 --> 25:50.772
P-O-U-C-H-O-I-R.

25:51.293 --> 25:54.579
Yeah, that's how you spell it.

25:56.442 --> 25:56.622
P-O-C-H.

25:56.663 --> 25:58.887
No, P-O-U-C-H.

25:58.907 --> 26:02.634
I've got to do it on paper.

26:02.654 --> 26:03.936
That's okay.

26:03.956 --> 26:04.397
I can't.

26:04.833 --> 26:10.226
It's simple, is what it is.

26:10.407 --> 26:18.767
And they use them for fashion.

26:18.887 --> 26:21.814
Let's go back to Munchen Building.

26:21.854 --> 26:22.977
The Munchen Building.

26:23.243 --> 26:29.751
It went on, I think there are about somewhere up in the neighborhood of 1,500 or 1,600 of them.

26:30.511 --> 26:34.416
And they went on for about 50 years.

26:34.456 --> 26:35.777
And they were into the UO sheets?

26:35.798 --> 26:36.919
Yeah, they're big sheets, like this.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.262
They sold them on the street.

26:39.702 --> 26:45.168
And we sold them, as I say, they were cheaper, plain, and they were colored, and they were expensive.

26:45.288 --> 26:45.709
Everybody.

26:46.210 --> 26:46.830
Everybody bought them.

26:46.890 --> 26:48.072
And they tried anything.

26:48.472 --> 26:50.955
They tried political satire.

26:51.256 --> 26:54.902
costumes of the world, historical kind of educational things.

26:55.202 --> 26:58.888
Is it a very Currier and Ives type of thing, though?

26:58.908 --> 26:59.008
No.

26:59.048 --> 27:00.610
Well, they varied.

27:01.151 --> 27:05.358
They were more often many pictures, almost like a comic strip.

27:06.239 --> 27:09.084
But comic strips is a little misleading.

27:09.104 --> 27:10.626
Some of them were very much comic strips.

27:11.407 --> 27:14.051
And the one, in fact, Paul came from was.

27:14.672 --> 27:17.837
But sometimes there were one big picture, sometimes there were two.

27:18.037 --> 27:22.281
Sometimes it was inspirational, sometimes it was historical, sometimes there were fairy tales.

27:23.102 --> 27:29.129
There was a beautiful one called the Mauschenzug, a procession of fairy tales.

27:29.449 --> 27:32.632
Well, zug means train, you know.

27:33.994 --> 27:37.417
It was a whole procession of fairy tales, creatures from Grimm.

27:37.838 --> 27:39.299
Beautiful thing.

27:39.399 --> 27:42.162
That was a Bilderbogen.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.384
You collect Bilderbogen?

27:43.404 --> 27:44.685
Yeah, we do, we do.

27:44.952 --> 27:51.179
And actually, we saw in Munich a big collection of them that we didn't want.

27:51.199 --> 27:51.419
In Munich?

27:52.080 --> 28:00.370
I'm sorry, in Zurich, a big collection of these that we didn't want to buy because they were very expensive, and we had some, and it was well-bound, and we didn't.

28:00.770 --> 28:04.274
How expensive was your collection?

28:04.294 --> 28:04.674
I don't know.

28:05.115 --> 28:06.897
My husband is the one to ask about these things.

28:06.997 --> 28:08.339
I don't probably 50.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.382
Are they expensive?

28:11.682 --> 28:19.353
Who collects them primarily, Europeans or Americans, would you say?

28:19.373 --> 28:24.080
Probably Europeans, but all that kind of thing is pretty international.

28:27.244 --> 28:28.886
So tell me how Carl knew this.

28:28.947 --> 28:35.075
Well, we saw this, and it was a kind of little sort of cartoony.

28:35.095 --> 28:36.998
At the time, I didn't know any German.

28:37.552 --> 28:40.055
And so we couldn't read it, but it was obvious.

28:40.075 --> 28:43.399
It was this little dog who gets left with the baby.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.883
And the baby falls out of the cradle.

28:46.263 --> 28:49.707
And so he cries, and so the dog brings him toys.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.813
And then he... Oh, that's wonderful.

28:53.853 --> 28:54.894
That's a great little cow.

28:54.974 --> 28:55.835
That's right.

28:55.855 --> 28:56.396
That's right.

28:56.516 --> 29:00.621
And then the baby goes to the window, and the dog grabs him back.

29:00.661 --> 29:05.027
And then somehow he manages to get him back in the cradle, and the baby gets back in himself, I think.

29:05.328 --> 29:10.573
And then the mother comes and it's all back to normal.

29:10.633 --> 29:12.094
When did this happen?

29:12.214 --> 29:14.036
Somebody asked me that before.

29:14.096 --> 29:15.557
I have to figure backwards.

29:15.678 --> 29:16.458
How can I in 85?

29:16.919 --> 29:25.527
I must have been working on it since the spring of 84.

29:25.547 --> 29:26.708
No, it's early.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.210
It doesn't have to be anymore.

29:29.470 --> 29:31.252
Probably we were at least into Bologna.

29:31.773 --> 29:33.394
We're stopping at Zurich on our way home.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.616
Did it hit you immediately?

29:35.676 --> 29:40.845
Well, my husband said, you know, that would make a really good children's book, that general idea.

29:41.166 --> 29:45.413
And in fact, Carl, we didn't buy, as I say, buy the street collection.

29:45.433 --> 29:49.500
In fact, Carl is my missed memory of what the dog's name was.

29:50.041 --> 29:54.589
Good Dog Carl is really an attempt simply to call it by the Bilderbogen name.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.214
Because it was called Braav Karo.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.578
That's spelled for me, okay.

29:59.598 --> 30:04.306
Braav, B-R-A-V-E, which in German means... See, was it a cow with a C or a K, though?

30:04.546 --> 30:08.172
Well, it was spelled K-A-R-O, as a matter of fact.

30:08.853 --> 30:15.103
But I misremembered how I got from Karo to Carl, fell with a C, which isn't even German, I don't know.

30:15.123 --> 30:18.589
I mean, it's Swedish, actually.

30:19.430 --> 30:19.851
Anyway.

30:20.641 --> 30:28.391
Anyway, but it, brav in that sense, you use it like bravo, and you use it for children.

30:28.871 --> 30:32.015
Children or dogs to mean good work, well done.

30:32.035 --> 30:35.520
You say it to a child who's done well in school, you say it to a dog, it means good dog.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.583
We've got a big black lab.

30:39.184 --> 30:39.825
Right.

30:39.845 --> 30:46.613
You know, he brings you the stick, and you say, she brings you the stick, you know, and you say brav, brav, whatever.

30:47.174 --> 30:48.015
That's right.

30:48.095 --> 30:49.517
Exactly that's how you use it.

30:49.835 --> 30:57.022
So, The Good Dog, Carl, was simply a translation of, apparently, simply translated the name of this very book.

30:57.282 --> 30:58.083
That's a good story.

30:58.444 --> 30:59.625
Have you told this story?

30:59.785 --> 31:00.906
Oh, yeah.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.428
It has been printed around.

31:02.568 --> 31:03.148
Oh, yeah, it has.

31:03.168 --> 31:04.129
They keep repeating it.

31:04.189 --> 31:05.391
Everybody likes that story.

31:05.411 --> 31:06.632
Well, I'm going to use it anyway.

31:07.353 --> 31:11.897
Anyway, it's... It would be wonderful if it hadn't been, but that's okay.

31:14.199 --> 31:17.783
And, as a matter of fact, it turned out later that we had the...

31:17.999 --> 31:44.732
that particular builder was in our collection yeah but anyway but so so really carl was my husband's idea um and uh in fact you know he doesn't uh he doesn't get credit for them but a number of them are really here this scholastic book the frank and ernest i don't know if you know those those are his stories yeah it's really what his ideas in the first place he came across a uh he came across um

31:45.202 --> 32:05.792
He was reading a book on, I don't know what he was reading a book on, somehow he came across this half-house Greek, you know, the language of the diners, and he said, you know, this is really terrific, and he started reading at some of these things, and we thought, gee, the children would love this, because children loved to play with language, they loved it.

32:05.992 --> 32:13.160
especially when they're learning language, the idea that it can go wrong, they find really funny.

32:13.741 --> 32:17.705
So we thought that would be a great idea, and I think it did turn into an excellent book.

32:17.725 --> 32:23.011
So he really wrote the three, well, there's a third now coming, and I'm working on it.

32:23.031 --> 32:24.833
But he really wrote those two.

32:27.075 --> 32:31.420
And we just didn't, he didn't want his name on, so we'll just leave him Alexander Day as simpler.

32:31.440 --> 32:35.965
But Alexander Day, in some senses, is a kind of a combination name.

32:36.350 --> 33:04.855
because he has certainly contributed a lot to uh many of them you can see he contributed the idea for carl now and he also having who knows i mean when when you work together for this many years you know somebody says something and somebody else says something and by the time you're through i mean who's the creator who knows i look a lot of the visual jokes and things are things i sort of make up as i go along in the carl books but

33:05.645 --> 33:10.212
He's certainly a very heavily participant in really all the books.

33:11.274 --> 33:14.399
I think Nate is the real winner.

33:17.565 --> 33:20.129
How about the idea of zero text?

33:21.251 --> 33:23.334
Oh, that wasn't cute.

33:24.776 --> 33:27.761
It's simply dogs and babies don't talk.

33:28.162 --> 33:30.185
Who's going to say anything?

33:30.205 --> 33:31.247
There's no speakers.

33:31.919 --> 33:36.525
But there's such a thing as an omniscient narrative, too.

33:36.626 --> 33:36.986
Yeah.

33:37.327 --> 33:40.070
It just didn't seem to fit somehow, but that was the reason.

33:40.431 --> 33:41.793
It didn't tell.

33:41.813 --> 33:45.498
It never occurred to you that you could introduce... Oh, of course it occurred to us.

33:45.518 --> 33:53.529
It just didn't seem... You know, the hovering presence that... Yeah, but, yeah, and in fact, of course, the one, the Munich one is a narrative.

33:53.629 --> 33:54.290
It does tell.

33:54.310 --> 33:56.934
I don't know what it says, because I've never actually gone and tried to read it.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.057
But it's...

33:59.560 --> 34:02.944
Yeah, it could, but there didn't seem to be any need for it.

34:03.184 --> 34:08.149
And because it was kind of a challenge, I mean, I was an illustrator, so why not tell it in pictures?

34:08.710 --> 34:12.494
And you didn't have any... Did you have any idea that it was funny?

34:12.514 --> 34:12.634
Don't.

34:13.095 --> 34:14.476
I mean, we thought it was a good idea.

34:14.516 --> 34:15.297
We enjoyed it.

34:16.118 --> 34:17.519
That's all you ever know when you spread.

34:17.539 --> 34:19.602
How long have you been doing children's books?

34:19.622 --> 34:24.647
Well, the first one I did was Teddy Bear's Picnic, which was... That's a wonderful book.

34:24.667 --> 34:25.568
I know.

34:25.868 --> 34:29.897
I love them and I love them.

34:30.157 --> 34:36.330
My wife is going to review them with me this year.

34:37.854 --> 34:39.317
Pardon me for getting into this.

34:41.782 --> 34:43.305
No, that was the first one I did.

34:43.325 --> 34:44.067
That was where?

34:44.087 --> 34:44.348
About?

34:44.368 --> 34:46.392
83, I think.

34:46.557 --> 34:49.641
Boy, you're just kind of an instrument to this, right?

34:49.661 --> 34:55.809
Yeah, well, I was, I always, from a child, as I say, wanted to be a painter, I came from a very artistic family.

34:56.250 --> 35:04.300
I mean, what one did on their vacation was get out the wear colors, and, you know, you'd see uncles just scattered around the painting, that kind of thing.

35:04.761 --> 35:06.163
So, I was pretty clear about it.

35:06.183 --> 35:07.024
I always wanted to do that.

35:07.064 --> 35:15.315
I went to Swarthmore, which doesn't have an art, because I didn't have an art department, an art appreciation, but doesn't have any practical things.

35:15.582 --> 35:19.267
And so I really have not had very much training.

35:19.307 --> 35:20.209
Right.

35:22.432 --> 35:25.977
So I have had very little form of training.

35:25.997 --> 35:36.773
Um, I took, I think, one or two courses at the art students, like, after Talia, and that's just, yeah, aside from what I was taught at home and what I saw, I'm really quite self-taught.

35:36.793 --> 35:40.358
But, uh, anyway, the, uh,

35:41.789 --> 35:47.135
So I always wanted to be a painter, and I do paint on my own.

35:47.215 --> 36:02.751
I mean, I have a fair number of paintings that are not illustrations, but I certainly wasn't doing much of it in the years when we were running the Green Tiger in the bookstore and the theater and the whole works, and I had young children and all that.

36:03.912 --> 36:09.518
But I was doing designing for that, because I also had to run the design department of the Green Tiger.

36:09.953 --> 36:12.817
And I did something for the Green Tiger.

36:12.837 --> 36:22.070
I mean, we'd get stuck, you know, we didn't have enough pictures for a calendar, and we had to whip in an April teddy bear or something, you know, I'd have to, I'd do that.

36:22.150 --> 36:29.160
But I wasn't doing a lot of illustrating and so forth in that period, but then when,

36:29.562 --> 36:53.663
we decided we would do the teddy bear thickening i thought it might be kind of fun we had my son and a friend of ours has a wonderful those have wonderful collections of old teddy bears so it was kind of obvious we have all the great models for the for i mean it's actually the old and the uh the malls we're seeing there so

36:53.997 --> 36:55.862
I thought, well, I'm trying to illustrate a book.

36:55.882 --> 37:01.134
I mean, I've been publishing everybody else's illustrations for all this time, you know, over 10 years or something.

37:01.275 --> 37:03.520
I don't know, doing myself and myself.

37:03.540 --> 37:07.129
But I did that one and then, well done.

37:07.413 --> 37:11.218
three more for the Green Tiger before we sold them.

37:11.238 --> 37:12.119
The Green Tiger did that.

37:12.139 --> 37:13.481
Yes, yes.

37:13.781 --> 37:26.498
In fact, that's one of the reasons why Alexander Day, the name, came into existence because it had so many advantages to have a moment of doom in a situation where I was running the press.

37:27.018 --> 37:30.263
I was my own agent and all that kind of thing.

37:30.283 --> 37:34.348
It was a deep dark secret for a long time.

37:34.328 --> 37:48.402
I think I had it maybe, well, I don't know how long really, I think, but until after we sold the Green Tiger anyway.

37:48.482 --> 37:52.526
And how did those early books do far enough?

37:52.546 --> 37:53.887
They did very well.

37:54.007 --> 37:59.813
I mean, I don't know how many it sold out, but it's well over 40 years.

38:00.383 --> 38:04.229
I would think.

38:04.289 --> 38:09.016
The green tiger did very well.

38:09.176 --> 38:15.626
Even though our distribution was weak and kind of handmade and so forth.

38:15.646 --> 38:19.692
You see, one of the things we did is we kept listening.

38:20.212 --> 38:22.255
We kept with things.

38:22.275 --> 38:23.397
In fact, people would complain.

38:23.417 --> 38:25.301
They couldn't tell our back list from our front list.

38:26.583 --> 38:29.368
And that meant... David does the same thing.

38:29.388 --> 38:30.750
Yeah, that's right.

38:30.770 --> 38:34.997
And it meant that Brooks kept going because they were out there.

38:35.197 --> 38:37.119
But maybe it's not quite that high.

38:37.179 --> 38:39.682
I'm sure it's 200,000 there by now.

38:39.702 --> 38:41.104
But it did very well.

38:41.124 --> 38:43.807
And it held its record in the back, and it did Carl.

38:44.407 --> 38:46.970
You know, Ron ordered and ordered Bologna.

38:46.990 --> 38:47.811
It did very well.

38:47.831 --> 38:53.518
So how did you, now you took Carl to, did you act as your own agent on this?

38:53.538 --> 38:54.038
On Carl?

38:54.219 --> 38:54.479
Yeah.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.322
Well, the first Carl, you mean the second, were they Carl ones?

38:57.342 --> 38:58.023
Yeah.

38:58.163 --> 38:59.705
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:59.745 --> 39:04.410
But when we left the Green Tiger, we had, we filmed the Blue Lantern Studio.

39:04.795 --> 39:24.660
which was going to be a book packaging thing and also to do a book packaging you know business and also it was going to do it helped we had a contract with the new owner of the green tiger for a while uh for two years in fact a longer contract but uh

39:24.978 --> 39:31.625
to do the design and other development and things for him because he didn't, he didn't have anybody to do that at all.

39:32.046 --> 39:35.389
And by the reason he's got it, he wanted to keep us and we didn't want to work for him.

39:35.830 --> 39:44.439
So we had this packaging agreement with him to get, to show him books and he would pick some out and then, and then take them and then publish them for the green carter.

39:44.479 --> 39:47.482
And then once he didn't want, we would take us well, which we did.

39:48.503 --> 39:52.167
But the reason, I mean, obviously he would have wanted Carl, but we had a big,

39:52.383 --> 40:05.919
We had a big argument with him about royalties, and he didn't afford to pay him, and so we said, well, you don't have to carry more textbooks again until you do it.

40:06.380 --> 40:13.328
So we eventually broke with him, and so we have no more connection, no more legal connection with the Green Tiger at all.

40:13.348 --> 40:21.698
But in the course of that, then we decided to take the call, to take another call to somebody else.

40:21.863 --> 40:32.680
We knew them before, when we owned the Green Tiger.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.585
I went to them not because they wanted.

40:35.705 --> 40:43.257
I went to Viking and Scholastic.

40:43.277 --> 40:47.584
I only went to four people, Random House, Viking, Scholastic.

40:48.155 --> 40:51.629
On HBJ, I think they do wonderful things.

40:51.649 --> 40:52.191
Well, they do.

40:52.854 --> 40:57.473
They're right in our city, but I don't know the...

40:58.786 --> 41:17.351
I've never felt much, yeah they are, I don't know, I've never felt much personal, kind of, I don't know, sympathy or something with the... I think the product they do is lovely, lightened in the night.

41:17.371 --> 41:18.973
More of those beautiful products.

41:18.993 --> 41:22.238
Well, I just took it to those because I knew they were interesting.

41:23.119 --> 41:25.502
And I, and...

41:25.904 --> 41:41.040
They didn't, and so the three, Viking, Scorsic, and Floss, all wanted it, and I decided to go to Farrar because, just because I like them.

41:42.002 --> 41:44.084
I do like Scholastic, by the way, very much.

41:44.344 --> 41:45.766
I'll take a good work with Scholastic.

41:46.446 --> 41:49.610
I like Viking too, because Viking is awfully big.

41:50.190 --> 41:51.392
Things get lost in Viking.

41:51.412 --> 41:54.375
I have three, four books of Viking.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.023
They just disappear.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.948
You have one season and you're done.

41:58.369 --> 41:59.532
That's the trouble with Vikings.

41:59.953 --> 42:00.995
That's the trouble with Vikings.

42:01.156 --> 42:02.780
I like the editor there.

42:03.261 --> 42:05.307
They've always been very good.

42:05.327 --> 42:06.289
They've been generous.

42:06.455 --> 42:10.840
They've been, I have to say, their production is very good.

42:11.060 --> 42:15.385
I have no complaints about them, except that they're so big.

42:15.405 --> 42:17.448
The things just disappear so fast.

42:17.508 --> 42:23.014
Well, for instance, it's your book, so I... But, you know, I really don't want to say anything against them, but it's not their fault.

42:23.034 --> 42:24.596
I'm not going to use this.

42:25.076 --> 42:25.537
Yeah, yeah.

42:25.557 --> 42:35.989
Yeah, you really shouldn't, because it's just kind of... I only use about two or three slides, which I love, but I don't use two or three percent of what I get off the tape anyway, but one thing I like about...

42:36.323 --> 42:40.852
F.S.G., your book, for instance, is they pitching off the boat?

42:40.872 --> 42:42.976
I mean, they're not just pitching one book.

42:42.996 --> 42:58.146
They're doing... They are, they may, but of course, to do, you know, if one of the other publishers had it, they would do, you know, if they sent, as they say in the movie industry, it's got legs.

42:58.396 --> 43:24.572
then that's when they put their budget into it right that's when they put the money and all that stuff into it so those publishers it would have stood out you know in their list too if it had shown you know did they instantly like the idea of a book that was totally devoid of text i believe that

43:24.738 --> 43:28.263
I would have had real cover size if it hadn't happened.

43:28.363 --> 43:32.068
Remember, the first book has already had enormous selfies.

43:32.088 --> 43:38.177
The first book already had sold top 1,000.

43:38.838 --> 43:39.639
It does not.

43:39.659 --> 43:46.088
I think that if I had gone in cold, I don't think I could have gotten anybody's picture.

43:46.287 --> 43:49.011
You came in with a track record, isn't that right?

43:49.051 --> 43:49.772
That's right.

43:49.792 --> 43:50.372
That's right.

43:50.393 --> 43:52.876
And that speaks very eloquently for itself then.

43:52.916 --> 43:53.397
That's right.

43:53.417 --> 43:58.744
But nothing better then, because it was woodless.

43:58.764 --> 44:06.274
And also, to be honest with you, I don't know if they would have thought of it at the time, but probably, because they're so conscious of this kind of thing.

44:06.294 --> 44:09.358
This business of the mother leaving the baby with the dog.

44:09.608 --> 44:25.587
A question about the perfect answer to that, which always seems so silly when I tell them to laugh, but some people take it seriously.

44:25.848 --> 44:34.418
The answer is, of course, if you've got a dog who's as confident as power and a baby who's that good a rider, go ahead.

44:35.444 --> 44:37.809
Well, we had one.

44:38.430 --> 44:42.077
We had two dogs.

44:42.117 --> 44:50.213
We had a Rottweiler and an Irish carrier.

44:50.682 --> 44:56.347
I mean, I don't think a baby could lie on another scale.

44:56.387 --> 45:03.033
And actually, their reputation is such that if you could really lie on another scale.

45:03.053 --> 45:09.339
Well, and that, of course, is another thing, too, is that they're big, fierce dogs.

45:09.719 --> 45:11.220
I mean, they're fierce in a sense.

45:11.241 --> 45:12.081
They're very protective.

45:12.101 --> 45:13.302
They're very loyal.

45:13.322 --> 45:15.264
They're very nervous dogs.

45:15.444 --> 45:20.689
And they're very, very...

45:20.669 --> 45:23.893
Well, wary.

45:24.133 --> 45:25.815
They're suspicious dogs.

45:25.835 --> 45:28.438
And this is probably what makes them good watch dogs.

45:28.899 --> 45:31.142
But they're really big.

45:31.162 --> 45:32.723
They're powerful dogs.

45:33.224 --> 45:36.087
I mean, the dog that's been here totally young.

45:36.107 --> 45:40.413
When he was peeing, he chewed up a metal bucket.

45:40.433 --> 45:43.036
Literally.

45:43.056 --> 45:46.340
Those dogs could do an enormous amount of damage.

45:46.540 --> 45:49.984
That dog is like that when she was born.

45:50.099 --> 46:17.473
Yeah, but I mean, my point is that they really are powerful dogs, and they're very protective, and you get frightened, and you know, one of the things that you have to be a little careful about, if you've got a rat bar with children, is that your child doesn't get into a fight with another child.

46:18.027 --> 46:29.468
because the dog will go to the rescue of his master, and that's going to cause a little trouble.

46:29.488 --> 46:30.951
That's not funny.

46:31.251 --> 46:32.133
No, that's right.

46:32.153 --> 46:36.120
Because the child is, you know, when a child is in a serious fight,

46:36.438 --> 46:39.261
They sound like they're serious.

46:39.281 --> 46:42.846
Well, if it sounds serious, maybe it's good to have them talk with me.

46:42.906 --> 46:45.689
Well, not with another 10-year-old, you know.

46:45.709 --> 46:48.212
A 10-year-old, I'm sure.

46:48.232 --> 46:55.340
There was a wonderful piece in the New York Times a couple months ago about writing, how they've really taken off as a place in a big city.

46:55.360 --> 46:56.061
Yeah, I get it.

46:56.181 --> 46:56.381
Right.

46:56.502 --> 47:05.432
Yeah, and it's kind of, the Rathard people are dismayed about this because they feel there's a lot of, we have scripted reading, and they feel that people are irresponsible owners, which they are.

47:05.716 --> 47:12.507
And runners can go wrong because they're extremely sensitive dogs.

47:12.987 --> 47:16.172
They're easy to train because they want to please.

47:16.192 --> 47:23.604
But if you get them wanting to please the wrong person, you get real danger.

47:23.984 --> 47:29.513
You get them wanting to please somebody who's aggressive, sadistic, or whatnot,

47:29.932 --> 47:32.496
And you've got a very dangerous situation.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.078
Or you get people who neglect them.

47:34.999 --> 47:39.465
And then they get very sad and hurt and resentful.

47:39.706 --> 47:43.551
You know, there were several months, but I don't know.

47:43.571 --> 47:45.774
There had to be various owners.

47:45.834 --> 47:48.458
And the guy's walking inside the park.

47:48.798 --> 47:49.599
I forget what his name was.

47:49.619 --> 47:53.124
Billy or Kenny or something like that.

47:53.244 --> 47:53.745
A nice guy's name.

47:54.130 --> 47:55.771
The thing is, he likes to rest a lot.

47:55.791 --> 47:57.493
When he wants to rest, he does.

47:57.513 --> 48:02.117
I mean, you know, he does precisely what he wants to do.

48:02.177 --> 48:04.459
He weighs about 200 pounds, or whatever he weighs.

48:05.260 --> 48:07.722
Not quite that much, I know, but he's out there.

48:08.162 --> 48:15.609
There was a woman on Long Island, a group old, I don't know if I remember her name, and she's all of a sudden boomtown.

48:15.709 --> 48:16.810
Oh, I know.

48:16.830 --> 48:18.511
Yeah, that's right, it is.

48:18.531 --> 48:21.794
And people say, is it because it was tall of anything to do with it?

48:21.814 --> 48:22.534
Who knows?

48:22.554 --> 48:23.175
Maybe, I don't know.

48:23.628 --> 48:27.816
Has it changed your life at all?

48:27.956 --> 48:30.761
I mean, it's become a lot of different.

48:30.881 --> 48:36.090
No, it doesn't make an awful lot of difference.

48:36.111 --> 48:40.679
Well, yeah, but, you know, my life has always told so many things.

48:40.699 --> 48:43.824
I mean, it's just publishing.

48:43.985 --> 48:46.429
It's just something we've always been in.

48:46.449 --> 48:48.032
It surprises you, though.

48:48.350 --> 48:54.797
I knew that it would be, I mean, I always felt that it would be popular.

48:55.758 --> 49:03.706
But the size of it, I mean, it's pleasantly surprising, but I've been in the business too long to know that you can't predict.

49:03.786 --> 49:08.631
I mean, it's like the film industry or anything else, what lightning is going to strike?

49:08.651 --> 49:10.733
In retrospect, people say, why?

49:11.534 --> 49:14.577
In retrospect, you can say a few things that maybe explain it.

49:14.978 --> 49:18.022
But would I have picked it out to be a runaway bustle?

49:18.062 --> 49:18.763
No, to be honest.

49:18.783 --> 49:20.786
Would you target an audience?

49:20.806 --> 49:21.547
No, we never do.

49:22.669 --> 49:23.510
We never do.

49:23.851 --> 49:24.832
I don't know who I'm doing.

49:25.313 --> 49:27.876
Frankly, there are a lot of adult jokes in there.

49:28.978 --> 49:31.281
I do it to please myself, yeah.

49:31.442 --> 49:34.005
But there's some of them that are really over children's heads.

49:34.045 --> 49:38.792
I mean, particularly in the new one, I mean, the business about the paintings.

49:39.127 --> 49:42.271
The different styles of paintings that the artists are doing.

49:43.252 --> 49:44.994
I mean, that's kind of children's joke.

49:45.034 --> 49:48.638
They don't recognize Chagall or Mondrian or anything like that.

49:49.099 --> 49:51.121
That's an adult joke.

49:51.341 --> 49:54.004
I really do them to amuse myself as I go along.

49:54.565 --> 50:00.612
And also in the sketch club, I don't know if anybody will ever notice, but it's called the Allegro Sketch Club.

50:01.351 --> 50:08.703
And the reason for that was because I was sitting there, and I got to thinking about it, and I don't know, somebody said something.

50:09.965 --> 50:16.695
I realized that these people were going to have to be mighty speedy to have gotten this far with this baby and dog together.

50:16.956 --> 50:21.042
I figured they'd better be a Leggo.

50:21.062 --> 50:23.967
But just little things like that, you know.

50:24.622 --> 50:27.164
Do you get feedback?

50:27.184 --> 50:31.108
Do you find that adults enjoy the books as much as children?

50:31.128 --> 50:33.049
Do you think that they're buying them for themselves?

50:33.650 --> 50:35.271
They admit it a lot of times.

50:35.291 --> 50:40.856
A lot of the letters I get are from... Well, I get letters from children sometimes.

50:42.518 --> 50:54.088
A lot of letters are... I do get letters from children, but the letters I get from adults are

50:54.457 --> 51:03.747
Two things, either they're right by the people, right by the people who say, oh, this is a wonderful representation of our wonderful breed, thank you very much, that kind of thing.

51:04.267 --> 51:08.772
Or they're people with children and dogs.

51:10.393 --> 51:12.476
And they don't necessarily have to be a right by her.

51:13.036 --> 51:22.366
I mean, it can be, this car is exactly like my golden lover, Sheila, you know, and I have a 10-month-old baby and so forth.

51:22.706 --> 51:23.687
Or people read it.

51:23.887 --> 51:26.150
to their children.

51:26.170 --> 51:28.814
They claim that they read it to them at an incredibly young age.

51:28.834 --> 51:31.818
It's only six months old babies and things they read it to.

51:31.838 --> 51:35.243
So you say read it, but what's wonderful is that you reply to the text.

51:35.263 --> 51:36.064
That's right.

51:36.084 --> 51:36.625
They show me.

51:36.645 --> 51:39.830
That it is an interactive book in that respect, isn't it?

51:39.850 --> 51:41.412
That's right.

51:41.432 --> 51:49.143
I mean, I've had people say that they put the name of their dog into the book and they say, okay, now Sheila does this and Sheila does that.

51:49.724 --> 51:50.805
Or sometimes

51:51.443 --> 51:56.150
They read the book, and then the child starts calling the dog, Carl.

51:57.713 --> 52:03.582
People tell me that children rush up to them and talk and say, hi, Carl.

52:03.602 --> 52:05.185
So they have a rat bottle, you know.

52:05.325 --> 52:10.313
Do you, in your own mind, do you use the word read, the word read?

52:10.647 --> 52:12.310
What do you look at?

52:12.410 --> 52:14.573
You know, whatever you do with a book.

52:14.593 --> 52:18.219
Just because it's a book, you read a book, you look at a book, yeah.

52:18.259 --> 52:20.643
But really, it's a telling.

52:20.663 --> 52:21.144
Well, it is.

52:21.164 --> 52:21.865
It is narrative.

52:21.885 --> 52:22.366
Well, of course.

52:22.466 --> 52:24.710
I mean, it is narrative, whatever you want to tell.

52:25.691 --> 52:27.614
It's cinematic if you want to narrate.

52:27.634 --> 52:28.656
It doesn't gauge the reader.

52:28.889 --> 52:30.151
No, no, it doesn't.

52:30.171 --> 52:32.974
And that turns out to be... It doesn't engage the native.

52:32.994 --> 52:33.455
It doesn't.

52:33.475 --> 52:34.156
What does it mean?

52:34.196 --> 52:36.859
You're saying it does or it doesn't?

52:36.879 --> 52:37.140
The pictures?

52:37.160 --> 52:37.981
Yeah, no, no, no.

52:38.001 --> 52:38.341
It engages.

52:38.361 --> 52:38.682
No, no, no.

52:38.862 --> 52:39.763
I said other pictures.

52:39.783 --> 52:41.265
It doesn't gauge the reader's age.

52:41.305 --> 52:41.986
No, no, no.

52:42.006 --> 52:42.867
It engages.

52:42.887 --> 52:44.649
Well, yeah, apparently it does.

52:44.669 --> 52:45.831
No, it doesn't engage the reader.

52:45.851 --> 52:46.572
No, that's better.

52:46.592 --> 52:47.112
It does, apparently.

52:47.152 --> 52:47.813
It does engage.

52:47.873 --> 52:48.714
Apparently it does.

52:49.015 --> 52:51.538
I mean, people tell me that...

52:52.126 --> 52:55.812
Sometimes children want it told exactly the same way every time.

52:56.573 --> 52:59.818
Sometimes they want it told different every time when they make it up.

52:59.878 --> 53:02.983
But the telling is still arbitrary.

53:03.063 --> 53:03.403
Sure.

53:03.464 --> 53:04.926
You're providing the signpost.

53:06.949 --> 53:07.049
Sure.

53:07.069 --> 53:07.470
That's right.

53:07.530 --> 53:07.750
Yeah.

53:07.870 --> 53:09.713
And one thing teachers use it for.

53:09.773 --> 53:12.117
I get a lot of letters from schools and pictures.

53:12.538 --> 53:14.100
Teachers say, okay,

53:14.350 --> 53:15.912
What else could Carl do?

53:16.332 --> 53:23.841
And so I get a lot of letters from children of Carl going to the seashore, or Carl going to the White House, or Carl going to these other places.

53:23.901 --> 53:29.127
My daughters are very impressed that I didn't have any history today.

53:29.147 --> 53:33.352
I didn't really get their attention at this point.

53:34.213 --> 53:36.075
I love it, you know.

53:36.195 --> 53:38.738
I won't go into it, you know.

53:38.853 --> 53:46.084
I get to meet with a lot of people, and Nicole, guess where I'm from then?

53:46.104 --> 53:49.028
I mean, this is really very, very, very terrific.

53:50.030 --> 53:53.676
I'd like to talk to your husband at some point, not necessarily today.

53:53.696 --> 53:55.538
Well, you're going to have trouble tearing him away from that thing.

53:55.558 --> 53:55.819
That's it.

53:55.839 --> 53:56.139
That's it.

53:56.159 --> 53:58.182
Maybe I can crawl sometime in fact.

53:58.303 --> 53:59.264
Sure.

53:59.284 --> 54:03.190
Just for a little, I mean, this is not for this piece.

54:03.338 --> 54:08.904
This is now going to be lots of found books, I would say.

54:08.924 --> 54:18.754
Well, yeah, I mean, for all it's impressive, for all of Roger Strauss called me up and said, well, get the indoor track record, and we've never printed this many books in one season by an author.

54:19.034 --> 54:22.918
I said, oh, come on, you know, all your novels and best-selling novels?

54:23.018 --> 54:23.819
He said, no.

54:24.019 --> 54:25.481
Mother's got to roll?

54:25.621 --> 54:28.163
I said, oh, come on, Roger, this is what you use.

54:28.183 --> 54:29.925
He said, no, no.

54:30.005 --> 54:32.788
It's because, of course, there's several titles.

54:32.954 --> 54:36.681
But over the three titles around the 21st million copies as well.

54:37.743 --> 54:38.985
I hope it's done.

54:39.005 --> 54:48.462
I'm saying that I'm sure that Carl's adventures will be continuing now for a special time to come.

54:48.542 --> 54:48.883
Well, yeah.

54:48.923 --> 54:52.870
There's one more under contract which I'm going to do, which I'm working on now.

54:53.030 --> 54:55.114
It's going to be Carl's Masquerade.

54:55.448 --> 54:58.972
to go to a Masquerade party, follow the parents.

54:58.992 --> 55:00.714
How about coming up with the ideas?

55:00.775 --> 55:03.999
Do you still go back to the sources, the original sources, for inspiration?

55:04.319 --> 55:04.719
No.

55:04.900 --> 55:11.848
Well, Masquerade is really, again, the Christmas, I think, was my idea.

55:11.988 --> 55:13.230
As I say, I get lost.

55:13.290 --> 55:14.011
I can't remember.

55:14.872 --> 55:17.535
The shopping, I think, was my idea.

55:17.996 --> 55:19.658
Christmas might have been my idea or not.

55:19.698 --> 55:21.340
I can't remember.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.042
But the new one is his idea.

55:23.495 --> 55:32.208
and that party because he loves masquerade and costumes and he collects pictures and all kinds of things.

55:32.309 --> 55:37.076
It's wonderful, the sources, you know, he can provide me for costumes.

55:37.096 --> 55:46.110
I'm using, making great use of a wonderful old German catalogue of costumes that you could order for this masquerade party.

55:46.394 --> 55:49.437
and I'm going to have a lantern seen outside.

55:49.477 --> 55:50.658
He calls us pictures of lanterns.

55:50.798 --> 55:54.182
So this masquerading was his idea.

55:54.202 --> 55:55.083
Do you do this a lot?

55:55.103 --> 55:56.084
Do you go to these shows?

55:56.424 --> 55:59.227
Uh-huh, really.

55:59.307 --> 56:01.129
Are you both looking?

56:01.149 --> 56:02.550
No, we're both looking.

56:02.570 --> 56:04.572
And what exactly are you looking for?

56:04.592 --> 56:09.537
Well, it's hard to say.

56:09.558 --> 56:10.358
Interesting images.

56:10.979 --> 56:14.983
Images that we might use sometimes for something in some way.

56:15.267 --> 56:26.662
We realized that the world of ephemera is a great, uh, source of, uh, fascinating images.

56:26.682 --> 56:37.497
You know, the Blue Lantern has made, uh, and this is Carl's specialty, along with two reasons, he's a, was an author for the Green Party and a since the country.

56:37.517 --> 56:39.680
They're, of course, friend of ours.

56:39.700 --> 56:44.987
Uh, a number of books which are created out of the old books.

56:45.153 --> 56:56.449
Athenaeum has a couple, one that's called the Glorious Mother Goose, and then they now have, there's what they call a Glorious ABC, and Bantam put out a couple.

56:56.469 --> 57:02.937
They put out an Alice and something called the Three Fences, which is Snow White, Sydney, Beauty, and Cinderella.

57:03.318 --> 57:08.024
But the story is told in all different illustrations.

57:08.625 --> 57:12.831
I think there's 27 different editions of Alice that go into the

57:13.098 --> 57:16.784
that throw into the thing.

57:18.106 --> 57:20.049
The Chronicle has put out several.

57:20.069 --> 57:31.408
They've got a Child's Garden of Verses that we did for them, which is, each poem is illustrated with a different, well, there's some of these, but with the great illustrators of Child's Garden.

57:31.428 --> 57:36.255
And we've got a series of animal poems that are coming out done that way.

57:36.796 --> 57:37.317
Are you...

57:37.837 --> 57:44.265
If you were to describe the focus of your collection, would you say the ephemera, to use one word, are you ephemera collectors?

57:44.305 --> 57:48.451
We're ephemera collectors, but no, but certainly the beginning and the main body of it is books.

57:49.012 --> 57:55.160
The ephemera is, books are getting scarcer for one thing, we get so many.

57:55.660 --> 57:57.142
And again, they're illustrated books.

57:57.302 --> 57:59.305
All illustrated books, yeah, always illustrated.

57:59.420 --> 58:02.624
Children's of all kinds of illustrated books.

58:02.644 --> 58:05.447
All kinds of, certainly primarily children.

58:05.467 --> 58:07.149
Certainly, yes, the focus is actually.

58:07.169 --> 58:10.453
Are you familiar with the Ruth Baldwin collection of the University of Florida?

58:10.694 --> 58:11.234
I've heard of it.

58:11.254 --> 58:11.855
I've never seen it.

58:11.875 --> 58:13.277
I was down there last year.

58:13.297 --> 58:13.477
Really?

58:13.497 --> 58:14.718
That's really where she's back.

58:14.738 --> 58:16.180
Uh-huh, I'm sure it is.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.442
She was a great character.

58:17.462 --> 58:18.863
She wouldn't let the students in.

58:18.903 --> 58:22.888
I mean, only since she's died have they... That's gone.

58:22.928 --> 58:24.510
She literally sat at her door.

58:26.212 --> 58:27.274
I've got a great story.

58:27.294 --> 58:28.034
I don't have to have it.

58:28.054 --> 58:28.515
Thank you.

58:29.423 --> 58:39.254
You said that the books, and we can wrap this up if you'd like, and I can fly you sometime back out in California if you'd like.

58:39.334 --> 58:40.676
Yeah, okay.

58:40.736 --> 58:45.101
Well, I think that for these books, by the way, I might write this piece.

58:46.282 --> 58:51.589
Does it suit your purposes better to have it published now or more towards the season?

58:51.609 --> 58:53.551
Well, I think the books are in the stores now.

58:53.571 --> 58:53.671
Okay.

58:53.831 --> 58:58.036
So I think that for our position is any time now.

58:58.056 --> 58:58.196
Okay.

58:58.216 --> 58:58.857
Just good.

58:59.140 --> 59:02.205
Because I'm going to be doing a lot of round-ups, too.

59:02.445 --> 59:08.634
I mean, this won't be part of the round-up, but it might be a nice piece to precede the stuff.

59:08.654 --> 59:10.277
I mean, it'll be a separate... Yeah, any time.

59:10.317 --> 59:12.800
I think any time now it's been being as fun.

59:12.820 --> 59:13.982
Okay.

59:14.002 --> 59:17.147
And the book collection is still a primary collection.

59:17.788 --> 59:18.088
Yeah.

59:18.469 --> 59:19.771
Yeah, it is.

59:19.951 --> 59:27.342
As I say, because there is a finite number of books, and there is almost an infinite number of ephemera,

59:27.710 --> 59:33.981
But we do more, I wouldn't say we do more ephemera collections because we still get books a lot.

59:34.422 --> 59:40.012
But we have done more specific ephemera collections in the recent years than we did in the past.

59:40.032 --> 59:42.837
We didn't get onto ephemera collections as early as books.

59:42.857 --> 59:44.560
I mean, books is where we started.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.343
We didn't get onto ephemera collections.

59:46.812 --> 59:50.777
You sort of pick up a thing here or there, but we didn't really get on to it.

59:50.978 --> 59:52.580
Do you collect a couple?

59:53.120 --> 59:54.943
Are these individuals?

59:54.963 --> 59:57.566
Do you kind of look for things that interest you?

59:57.727 --> 59:58.628
Oh, sure.

59:58.668 --> 01:00:00.570
We'll both.

01:00:00.611 --> 01:00:02.793
We both collect for each other.

01:00:02.894 --> 01:00:08.822
I told him, if you see anybody like it, ask me if they've got any old patterns.

01:00:08.902 --> 01:00:10.524
I collect old patterns.

01:00:10.544 --> 01:00:14.389
And what is Harold looking for, generally?

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:17.036
I mean, so you have an excuse.

01:00:17.056 --> 01:00:19.180
You're looking for ideas for the books.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.844
No, I'm not to do things for the books.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.947
Well, I never do that, actually.

01:00:24.028 --> 01:00:25.590
I never think of that.

01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:35.186
So you don't justify this as that it's a functional... Well, I do, but I look for things mostly for blue lantern things, mostly what I'm looking for.

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:35.366
I see.

01:00:36.488 --> 01:00:39.533
When I go to the gym, I'm thinking about...

01:00:40.188 --> 01:00:44.796
I don't think of myself as an illustrator, primarily, but as a painter.

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:49.263
I mean, when I travel, I spend a lot of time in museums.

01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:49.944
He does, too.

01:00:50.024 --> 01:00:53.791
I spend a lot of time in museums, but I'm thinking about painting.

01:00:56.776 --> 01:01:06.111
And the illustrations are... The illustration is different from evil painting.

01:01:07.087 --> 01:01:13.284
Because there's got to be more narrative, especially if it's wordless, of course, that could be explanatory.

01:01:13.585 --> 01:01:20.083
But I don't think it should be, at all possible, I don't think it should be any less good a painter without reading.
