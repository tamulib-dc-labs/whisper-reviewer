WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:07.946
I don't collect bindings.

00:07.966 --> 00:11.070
But these are pretty nice, though.

00:11.150 --> 00:12.071
Pictorial croft.

00:12.111 --> 00:13.993
No, I don't collect pictorial croft.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.935
These are for some other reason.

00:15.955 --> 00:19.919
These were part of a— They're all Arabian knights, isn't it?

00:20.019 --> 00:20.800
Yeah, exactly.

00:20.820 --> 00:27.527
These were all part of a collection from the one—rather than the whole group, I took a part of a group.

00:28.268 --> 00:31.312
Two, four, six, eights are about a game.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.514
That you don't see.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.587
That's a great collection.

00:36.627 --> 00:40.111
Look at all the different versions of the Arabian Nights.

00:40.271 --> 00:40.651
Yeah.

00:41.352 --> 00:49.481
See, that doesn't do anything for you, right?

00:50.162 --> 01:04.598
This is... So I'm still in the acquisition mode.

01:07.463 --> 01:09.386
I'm fortunate that I have the resources.

01:10.487 --> 01:26.829
Well, I mean, I think a collection like this also, I don't, I'm not dumb, but I'm also, you know, I think I have the largest collection of quadruplicates.

01:26.889 --> 01:28.090
Of what?

01:28.571 --> 01:29.252
Quadruplicates.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.042
Well, do you do... No, you have Ivy now.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.044
Does she assist you in the acquisitions?

01:38.144 --> 01:38.244
No.

01:39.205 --> 01:42.929
She is a checkpoint for me, as other people are.

01:43.749 --> 02:02.326
And what they try to do is keep me from making... Oh, look at this.

02:02.546 --> 02:03.407
This place was...

02:03.995 --> 02:06.197
20,000 books went out of here already.

02:07.158 --> 02:09.721
These are some.

02:12.764 --> 02:14.986
And it's basic metal shelving.

02:15.406 --> 02:16.007
Yeah, yeah.

02:16.307 --> 02:17.448
There's a little reading room.

02:17.989 --> 02:20.872
Did anybody use these books?

02:21.052 --> 02:22.093
Some people came over.

02:22.473 --> 02:26.377
These are manuscripts, collect a lot of what people did.

02:26.758 --> 02:32.263
These are children's illustrated stories, but on print, on lemon textiles.

02:33.323 --> 02:39.892
I love this, the little library of knowledge.

02:39.952 --> 02:40.633
What is this?

02:41.895 --> 02:44.598
Is that like a little case of books, actually?

02:47.743 --> 02:47.863
Yeah.

02:47.883 --> 02:48.664
Oh, this is lovely.

02:49.064 --> 02:49.725
Oh, that's great.

02:49.785 --> 02:50.366
Isn't that nice?

02:51.067 --> 02:53.090
Scrolls, theaters.

02:53.591 --> 02:57.015
Would you mind if I shoot a couple pictures tomorrow or today even?

02:57.376 --> 02:59.078
Here's a whole group of books.

02:59.345 --> 03:06.736
This is an illustrator of a lady who did 50, 60 books, and this was the doll she used for the illustrations for this.

03:07.857 --> 03:10.261
And I bought the whole thing, and I felt, you know, someday.

03:10.801 --> 03:11.562
Not my style.

03:12.884 --> 03:13.085
Nice.

03:13.625 --> 03:14.046
Beautiful.

03:15.047 --> 03:18.152
Maybe tomorrow, if you don't mind, we can shoot some pictures in here.

03:18.172 --> 03:19.534
These are early materials here.

03:21.036 --> 03:23.219
Lear is another specialty of mine.

03:23.339 --> 03:24.461
Edward Lear, yeah.

03:24.901 --> 03:27.365
I have his original manuscripts.

03:27.726 --> 03:28.086
This is

03:28.876 --> 03:30.519
You have his original manuscripts?

03:30.539 --> 03:31.762
Yeah, yeah.

03:31.782 --> 03:33.184
That's the part I set up.

03:33.204 --> 03:35.669
But that's the duck that she made herself.

03:35.689 --> 03:40.719
Jemima, J-E-M, I am a puddle hyphen duck.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.024
This is her copy of very carefully.

03:43.044 --> 03:43.905
It's her copy.

03:44.427 --> 03:47.332
Yeah, illustrated where her sketches came from.

03:47.372 --> 03:48.775
Wow.

03:49.615 --> 03:54.222
So, you mentioned, like, the British Library.

03:54.242 --> 03:56.485
Do you feel competitive with these other institutions?

03:56.585 --> 04:00.510
No, you can't compete with Library Congress or British Library.

04:00.911 --> 04:02.814
Noah's Ark's I collect, that's another.

04:03.314 --> 04:09.884
I had a son named Noah, who was killed, and he and my wife.

04:10.384 --> 04:10.965
Right.

04:12.648 --> 04:13.589
I'm sorry.

04:13.609 --> 04:15.392
Do you remember them?

04:16.293 --> 04:18.576
Just sort of games, educational toys.

04:20.075 --> 04:32.052
I collect children's cookbooks as a subspecialty, because all my children like to cook.

04:33.014 --> 04:36.639
They're beautiful.

04:36.659 --> 04:37.821
Look at that.

04:37.961 --> 04:43.669
These are gorgeous books, German 18th and 19th centuries.

04:45.944 --> 04:49.508
And these, so many of these came from individual collections.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.290
They weren't acquired.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.192
There's another Ark.

04:53.212 --> 04:55.395
Yeah, those are the Grimm, early Grimm's.

04:55.695 --> 04:56.576
Oh, there's Grimm?

04:56.596 --> 04:58.098
First edition of the first Grimm's.

04:58.118 --> 04:58.378
Really?

04:58.418 --> 05:02.102
Where would that be?

05:02.142 --> 05:02.743
Glasses on.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.165
Okay, this one here.

05:06.387 --> 05:12.053
Justin said this may be the rarest, not the first.

05:15.509 --> 05:19.014
first book and put it out for children.

05:19.034 --> 05:24.181
And we picked that up at an auction for about two percent of what it should be.

05:24.922 --> 05:26.103
Kinder und Haus.

05:26.163 --> 05:26.544
Kinder und Haus.

05:26.664 --> 05:31.550
Children and housetales, folktales.

05:31.570 --> 05:34.374
Die Bruder Grimm, 1825.

05:34.474 --> 05:37.298
The earliest ones are 1825.

05:45.023 --> 05:45.804
I just got it.

05:47.127 --> 05:54.299
In fact, the lady who got it from you said, the other lady who was head of the Grimm Museum, she didn't realize it would go for that.

05:54.319 --> 05:55.661
No, she would have bought it for herself.

05:55.741 --> 05:55.881
Yeah.

05:56.542 --> 06:00.349
Bruno Munari, M-U-N-A-R-I, have all of these.

06:00.369 --> 06:07.381
I don't know if, you know, Munari, I think we've shipped out, but, uh, okay.

06:08.302 --> 06:11.267
This is some of the artwork.

06:22.081 --> 06:26.808
So, I'm trying to think of what—these are toys of Munari.

06:28.089 --> 06:28.430
His own?

06:29.051 --> 06:30.753
Yeah.

06:30.853 --> 06:33.938
Is Justin basically fine most of this stuff for you?

06:33.958 --> 06:38.164
No, Munari's something I do.

06:39.185 --> 06:43.671
These are original artwork for these people.

06:44.493 --> 06:48.358
I have—like, I just bought Baron Munkhausen—the real Baron Munkhausen,

06:49.452 --> 06:51.675
M-U-N-C-H-A-U-S-E-N.

06:51.755 --> 06:54.438
Yeah, there was a byron Mauthausen, but he became fictionalized.

06:54.959 --> 06:58.243
But the real one I picked up recently at an auction.

07:00.325 --> 07:01.086
Crookshank?

07:01.287 --> 07:02.428
Yeah.

07:02.448 --> 07:05.191
Craig, Grimm's Fairytales, Crookshank.

07:06.253 --> 07:09.357
Tomorrow maybe I'll take a few notes in this room, okay?

07:09.377 --> 07:12.941
Because I like to have the flavor of titles and things.

07:13.422 --> 07:16.185
Well, if you can show your computer printout of all the stuff.

07:16.891 --> 07:19.474
There were other things, you know, Pete shows which one to look at.

07:19.674 --> 07:26.202
But nothing beats looking at—there's an interactive story long before the invention of the computer.

07:26.322 --> 07:29.526
I bought a lot of them, about twenty of those from the 1700s.

07:31.228 --> 07:33.391
These are fables, again, La Fontaine.

07:33.971 --> 07:43.843
These are by—it happens to be very expensive, but it's by a very famous artist.

07:46.928 --> 07:50.612
I'll tell you what.

07:52.575 --> 07:54.337
This is name and tell, okay?

07:54.397 --> 07:57.501
So you've got to take these with a grain of salt.

07:57.521 --> 07:58.161
Okay.

07:58.181 --> 07:59.743
Can I help?

07:59.863 --> 08:04.569
I'm not an Alice collector, but I bought Lewis and Alice photographs.

08:05.590 --> 08:06.711
The original.

08:07.012 --> 08:09.074
Oh, oh, ones that are published.

08:09.094 --> 08:10.796
About half of them are published.

08:10.856 --> 08:12.058
Well, that's what I've seen as photographs.

08:12.078 --> 08:12.679
Yeah, right.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.463
And that was the way, that was how we got to know these

08:16.679 --> 08:17.880
No, these are Chagall.

08:19.803 --> 08:24.088
But I'm looking for another one, which are the original sketches of these.

08:26.010 --> 08:35.762
And I don't see them here again.

08:35.782 --> 08:41.910
So what I do also is I have another sub-collection of famous artists who did work for children.

08:49.265 --> 08:52.289
and seven dreamers.

08:54.011 --> 08:57.175
And so, I have, uh, the yard.

08:57.856 --> 09:00.540
He did an illustrated music book.

09:03.644 --> 09:03.784
Uh-huh.

09:03.984 --> 09:04.805
Uh, here's Sendak.

09:05.146 --> 09:05.807
I like Sendak.

09:06.467 --> 09:07.789
Did you have everything of his?

09:08.070 --> 09:14.618
I tried, but, uh, I'd like him to do something.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.219
We're friends.

09:17.762 --> 09:18.343
Uh, and we'll,

09:19.117 --> 09:22.101
I'll try to have—maybe have him do something at the library.

09:23.523 --> 09:24.244
Have him do some what?

09:24.605 --> 09:25.866
Do something at the library.

09:26.327 --> 09:26.928
That'd be nice.

09:27.408 --> 09:28.690
I'm hoping he'll talk to me.

09:28.710 --> 09:29.992
I know he's a busy man.

09:31.454 --> 09:32.175
I love him.

09:32.375 --> 09:35.940
He had the Melville connection with him.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.202
Yeah.

09:37.222 --> 09:39.505
So anyway, okay, let's walk around.

09:55.668 --> 09:58.032
Now, is all of this going off to Princeton at some point?

09:58.052 --> 09:58.152
Yeah.

09:58.953 --> 09:59.955
Like, this is a collection.

10:00.115 --> 10:03.781
I have a very, I'm told, a big collection of Scandinavian.

10:04.201 --> 10:05.283
So this is a children's book.

10:05.303 --> 10:13.376
Scandinavian runs the gamut for 50, 60 years of a children's, which I think should be interesting to somebody.

10:16.841 --> 10:18.383
These are counting books, I think.

10:19.265 --> 10:19.605
German.

10:20.286 --> 10:20.727
German.

10:20.947 --> 10:21.829
Scandinavian.

10:22.911 --> 10:23.852
Scandinavian what?

10:24.389 --> 10:25.254
This is magazines.

10:25.314 --> 10:26.662
Magazines, okay.

10:26.924 --> 10:29.700
And these are German counting books.

10:30.846 --> 10:32.053
Oh, pardon the German thing.

10:45.601 --> 10:49.726
Do they strike your fancy, or do they strike my fancy?

10:50.327 --> 11:04.104
So, are you thinking of the library, or are you thinking of, hey, that's cute, I'd like to have that, or is it, I guess it's all... I look first what strikes my fancy, and then what strikes my fancy isn't always what's for the library.

11:04.124 --> 11:05.626
So you've got a couple of Rackhams right here.

11:05.646 --> 11:05.746
Yeah.

11:06.327 --> 11:15.338
Well, when I knew the Starkies, the Rackhams were there, and, uh, he had the original drawings, Rackham drawings, et cetera, and, uh,

11:15.757 --> 11:17.680
But I really don't focus on Rackham.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.022
I've stayed away from Rackham.

11:19.042 --> 11:19.683
No, what are these?

11:20.123 --> 11:22.386
Corinna, Eric, Toby?

11:22.406 --> 11:23.448
Oh, that's right.

11:23.468 --> 11:25.250
Okay, these are my children now.

11:25.891 --> 11:31.780
And I told them they each could take books, whatever they wanted, out of the library up until the time their mother died.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.306
After that, they all go to Princeton.

11:36.326 --> 11:38.529
And I tried to build up a collection for them.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.933
I also tried to duplicate it.

11:41.173 --> 11:44.818
God, you reminded me, because my daughter asked me last night about that.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.288
About what now?

11:46.729 --> 11:47.149
Her books.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.774
These are books that you put together for the children.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.777
Well, like, okay, let's look inside.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.043
This one here.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.568
This is Aunt Bea, and the kids remember that with their mother reading to them.

12:02.108 --> 12:03.350
So here's our name in it.

12:03.370 --> 12:06.534
This had to be a very early book when we were kids.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.675
Oh, that's very nice.

12:07.695 --> 12:10.519
So these are books that are special to the children.

12:10.583 --> 12:16.754
And so you said to the children, listen, this is your chance, you'd better come in.

12:17.415 --> 12:20.641
And all the kids like this, so I had to buy two more coffees.

12:21.382 --> 12:22.224
They loved this book.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.950
And the same is to Minari.

12:28.375 --> 12:34.245
Let's see, it's Minari, let me see.

12:39.271 --> 12:41.774
Are these books that the kids remember?

12:42.074 --> 12:47.380
Oh, Dad, you've got to give me Phantom of the Opera.

12:47.480 --> 12:54.247
Well, my son gave me these, because the illustrator of these, he had to do a painting.

12:54.268 --> 12:58.893
And so he gave me these, and he said, okay, can I have them back with that picture?

12:58.913 --> 13:00.514
You know, he gave me these.

13:00.534 --> 13:05.119
The illustrator is Greg Hildebrand, H.I.O.

13:05.560 --> 13:05.980
Right.

13:06.821 --> 13:09.244
Not in my taste, either.

13:09.899 --> 13:19.749
But your son also likes these, this is Eric, he's a science fan.

13:19.769 --> 13:23.433
But he likes these Rackham's, these Peter Tannins, which are kind of nice.

13:23.453 --> 13:24.494
Yeah, I was surprised at that.

13:24.994 --> 13:27.837
You never, that's another one thing, you never know what children remember.

13:28.438 --> 13:34.424
It's like when I listen to him talk about trips we had, and I said, was I in the car then?

13:34.905 --> 13:36.046
You know, when I was driving.

13:36.606 --> 13:38.168
So I have a completely different thing.

13:38.907 --> 13:51.550
I'm looking forward to seeing a book of Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.

14:08.928 --> 14:13.155
Well, this is nice.

14:13.395 --> 14:13.735
Anyway.

14:14.757 --> 14:16.500
Charlotte's Web, the movie.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.343
Yeah, right.

14:18.363 --> 14:20.125
The water baby is like Charlotte's Web.

14:20.145 --> 14:23.070
She liked the million books, so I've been accumulating.

14:23.090 --> 14:26.055
Even today, I buy more of it.

14:26.075 --> 14:30.261
And Charlotte likes some of those.

14:38.206 --> 14:49.739
Well, that's by my wife's sister, who's an artist, and this was a .

14:53.423 --> 15:01.952
Again, these are 19th, 20th century books, which I like either because of the illustration or for some other reason.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.099
Australian fairy tales.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.865
Picture books, 20th century.

15:13.885 --> 15:15.828
Picture books, 20th century.

15:17.030 --> 15:22.400
So there's no, of course, the curse of trying to be comprehensive is that you can never do it all.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.402
Yeah, right.

15:23.482 --> 15:29.293
So what I do is I usually walk in those books for about three, four times a year in New York a year and wipe them out.

15:32.359 --> 15:33.120
And buy what I like.

15:39.580 --> 15:49.636
Well, all of this goes to Princeton, right?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.238
Yeah.

15:51.258 --> 15:59.631
I mean, the toys— I've got to assume these are stuff that we bought within the last two years, a year or two, that didn't make the catalog.

16:00.172 --> 16:02.155
So, that's why we didn't go over.

16:02.415 --> 16:03.838
Well, what are these arts?

16:03.858 --> 16:07.984
Are these things that people made, or do you think they're fantastic?

16:08.977 --> 16:12.862
I mean, was it toys like you could buy, or I don't know if somebody made it.

16:13.162 --> 16:13.403
Right.

16:13.423 --> 16:13.984
Somebody did.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.427
That's a toy you bought in Switzerland.

16:16.587 --> 16:18.690
I remember buying it.

16:18.710 --> 16:18.870
Okay.

16:18.910 --> 16:19.871
And it pulls on wheels.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.013
Which one now?

16:21.033 --> 16:21.774
This one here?

16:28.382 --> 16:28.462
No.

16:28.483 --> 16:29.924
Those craftsmen made.

16:30.846 --> 16:33.389
So, I don't know.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.891
They just couldn't exude them.

16:34.911 --> 16:35.311
Really?

16:35.331 --> 16:37.695
No, it's on mine, I guess.

16:37.715 --> 16:38.055
Anyway.

16:38.356 --> 16:39.697
You mean at Preston?

16:39.997 --> 16:40.558
No, here.

16:40.638 --> 16:42.360
Oh, here?

16:42.380 --> 16:44.762
These are picture books, Chinese, Japanese.

16:45.843 --> 16:50.507
One of the things I really am interested in is, oh, say, this one here.

16:50.527 --> 17:00.496
Japanese and Japanese and what they look like and how they, in a sense, look at the sum that I can figure out.

17:00.516 --> 17:06.341
Okay, here's one.

17:06.361 --> 17:07.182
Western dress.

17:07.803 --> 17:35.903
counting early raincoats from the folk to the other, the advent of—this is way back when.

17:39.494 --> 17:40.255
These are lovely.

17:40.275 --> 17:41.216
These look at the ask.

17:41.256 --> 17:43.500
They must be here.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.681
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:44.701 --> 17:46.324
And not very well known.

17:46.364 --> 17:47.726
Now, where did you pick these up?

17:47.806 --> 17:48.406
In Japan?

17:48.627 --> 17:49.588
Some in Japan.

17:50.009 --> 17:51.070
Personally, you've got them all.

17:51.210 --> 17:52.032
Yeah, yeah, and some here.

17:52.052 --> 17:56.698
So, you're the Chief Acquisitor, right?

17:56.718 --> 17:57.359
Yeah, yeah.

17:57.419 --> 18:03.968
The whole game, you know, early game dip.

18:03.988 --> 18:05.811
This is really spectacular.

18:06.031 --> 18:08.134
Well, I'm so glad we came in here.

18:08.317 --> 18:11.480
And all the great stuff, of course, is at Princeton now, right?

18:11.500 --> 18:12.060
Right.

18:12.641 --> 18:12.941
Yeah.

18:12.961 --> 18:16.404
You're looking at just recent, you know, ABCs, English.

18:16.504 --> 18:18.566
So these are just the recent acquisitions?

18:19.167 --> 18:27.414
I think so, mostly, yeah.

18:27.494 --> 18:30.296
When do you plan a visit to Princeton?

18:30.497 --> 18:32.278
It's a Jewish regatta.

18:32.739 --> 18:32.879
Uh-huh.

18:33.019 --> 18:34.540
So we do that backwards.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.783
But it's from Japanese converts.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.594
were converted from the time of the nuclear fusion.

18:40.614 --> 18:44.119
And Japanese had never realized that there was such a thing.

18:44.139 --> 18:49.186
There were 30,000 troops in Japan, converted after the explosion.

18:49.487 --> 18:49.967
Really?

18:49.987 --> 18:54.133
And if they all wanted to go to Israel, Israel wouldn't take them.

18:54.153 --> 18:55.856
Very funny.

18:55.876 --> 18:57.318
It's funny, isn't it?

18:57.338 --> 19:00.062
Anyway, they're all in a long view here in Japan.

19:00.082 --> 19:00.182
Yeah.

19:00.543 --> 19:03.727
How many different countries do you think you have represented?

19:03.747 --> 19:04.168
No idea.

19:04.729 --> 19:05.450
A lot.

19:05.470 --> 19:05.610
A lot.

19:06.232 --> 19:09.295
Like Nigeria, I have people send them to South Africa.

19:09.696 --> 19:11.878
Today, in transition, I'm really interested in.

19:12.179 --> 19:13.961
These are all dealer catalogs.

19:13.981 --> 19:16.984
Is everything purchased, or is the people giving things?

19:17.364 --> 19:18.686
Sometimes.

19:19.327 --> 19:22.991
I never like to be as bad.

19:23.491 --> 19:26.975
There's going to be an exhibition of these arts?

19:26.995 --> 19:28.597
I think so.

19:28.617 --> 19:29.518
Here in L.A.?

19:29.538 --> 19:30.079
Yeah.

19:30.099 --> 19:30.659
Do you know when?

19:31.240 --> 19:32.682
Usually, I don't know.

19:32.702 --> 19:34.804
Curita has to come down and photograph them.

19:35.088 --> 19:42.980
I think in 90, I don't know, eight, nine, I don't know.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.806
It's quite a remarkable collection.

19:46.966 --> 19:51.333
It really is, and then it's really been like it.

19:52.054 --> 19:54.298
Hi, that was Anne.

19:54.318 --> 19:58.885
She would like you to call her before you leave.

20:03.691 --> 20:07.396
Well, what would be good for you tomorrow?

20:07.416 --> 20:11.080
I don't think we need more than two hours, max, an hour and a half.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.443
An hour and a half is about nothing I'd like to give you.

20:13.463 --> 20:19.831
I think an hour and a half max, and I'd like to shoot some pictures of you and maybe in here, if that's okay.

20:20.952 --> 20:25.838
I got a 10 o'clock hair appointment.

20:25.978 --> 20:28.281
I got a luncheon appointment at 12.

20:29.155 --> 20:31.778
and a large Indian collection.

20:31.858 --> 20:32.839
Say that again, please.

20:32.859 --> 20:44.192
I'm interested in how American Indians, the perceptions changed from 100 years ago or 50 years ago to today, and how romanticized or un-romanticized.

20:44.212 --> 20:57.087
Like, I have a book, which is from the 1870s, of an Indian chief, I think one of the Algonquin tribe, who did for his kids on birch bark and put 24 animals in the woods.

20:57.151 --> 21:02.478
in the Algonquin language, translated by a minister.

21:03.039 --> 21:04.601
It's a unique copy.

21:04.962 --> 21:05.663
I would think so.

21:06.564 --> 21:10.249
That was the language that Eliot did the Bible in.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.492
The Eliot Indian Bible was in the Algonquin language.

21:12.953 --> 21:14.175
Yes.

21:14.195 --> 21:16.097
I have, I think, the primer for that.

21:16.258 --> 21:16.738
Is that right?

21:17.439 --> 21:17.620
Wow.

21:20.223 --> 21:25.791
Fortunately, I had one illustration, otherwise I wouldn't have taken it.

21:26.665 --> 21:29.788
manuscripts for Potter.

21:29.808 --> 21:31.190
This is quite remarkable.

21:31.470 --> 21:36.015
And this is just stuff that hasn't made the trip yet, right?

21:37.597 --> 21:39.659
This is stuff that hasn't made the trip.

21:39.679 --> 21:41.441
Right.

21:41.461 --> 21:42.743
What's in the boxes over there?

21:42.783 --> 21:43.724
I can't read it from here.

21:44.605 --> 21:47.168
The clamshells, huh?

21:48.950 --> 21:55.677
A pamphlet had things like the ones that used to be in the entries.

21:57.935 --> 22:01.441
Not everything is old or rare or valuable, you know.

22:01.561 --> 22:02.483
No, it's a library.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.246
This is intended to be used.

22:04.306 --> 22:05.788
I think that's what we were driving at.

22:06.089 --> 22:20.533
Did you ever come in here alone, by yourself, and just kind of... I think my wife, she, my recent... I'm newly married, so she came, and she sits down, and she reads German, so she just really, you know, bikes and stuff, and

22:21.712 --> 22:26.702
Did you ever, when it was Phil, just kind of come in here and just sit around with the stuff?

22:26.822 --> 22:28.585
More so when I had it in the house.

22:30.329 --> 22:32.914
I had a library in the house, which was specially built.

22:34.116 --> 22:42.252
And I think I also had a gas alarm system, which my wife thought was personally built for her.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.292
That's why I thought.

22:44.973 --> 22:45.674
Suffocates.

22:45.694 --> 22:49.039
I always thought you were trying to kill me with a person.

22:49.059 --> 22:50.741
She needed a person.

22:50.761 --> 22:51.683
A person.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.323
I know it.

22:52.344 --> 22:52.604
Right.

22:53.365 --> 22:55.508
I know, but some of these catalogs here.

22:55.568 --> 22:58.112
I call it auction catalogs myself.

22:58.132 --> 22:59.574
Anyway, I guess that's great.

22:59.974 --> 23:02.518
Well, so what would be a good time for you to do?

23:02.859 --> 23:03.439
Even an hour.

23:03.459 --> 23:05.743
I think we could even make do with an hour.

23:06.163 --> 23:09.268
How about, I can do it from 11 to 12, then I'm out of action.

23:09.748 --> 23:10.630
11 to 12.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.272
I could do it from...

23:12.826 --> 23:16.531
2.30 to 3, or 3 to 5.

23:17.673 --> 23:20.798
I think I'm pretty good.

23:21.098 --> 23:22.981
Okay, why don't we schedule the afternoon?

23:23.021 --> 23:25.104
I could probably do some other things tomorrow.

23:25.284 --> 23:26.326
Okay, okay.

23:26.346 --> 23:27.908
Why don't we say 3 o'clock?

23:27.968 --> 23:28.750
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:31.033 --> 23:33.797
Josephine Goes Traveling by Mrs. H.C.

23:33.817 --> 23:39.205
Craddock, C-R-A-D-O-C-K, pictured by Honor C.

23:39.421 --> 23:40.522
Appleton, meaning what?

23:40.582 --> 23:41.564
That's the illustrator.

23:41.584 --> 23:51.155
That's the illustrator, and these are little Josephine's dollies, and these are the actual dolls that are modeled for them, and the rest are in the box.

23:51.175 --> 23:53.357
And what's the date on these, early 20th century dolls?

23:53.377 --> 23:54.519
They're the 20s.

23:54.539 --> 23:56.061
They got the teens in the 20s.

23:56.301 --> 23:58.303
And these are British illustrators?

23:58.323 --> 24:01.447
They're very popular British series.

24:02.168 --> 24:03.049
And those are the dolls?

24:03.549 --> 24:04.931
And these are the dolls.

24:04.951 --> 24:06.533
Where did you find them?

24:06.613 --> 24:08.675
They were purchased as an archive.

24:08.916 --> 24:09.276
I see.

24:10.505 --> 24:11.727
I have a lot of black material.

24:11.747 --> 24:14.190
I didn't see any here, but it may have been sent.

24:14.210 --> 24:14.510
It's been sent.

24:14.530 --> 24:16.252
But a lot of prejudicial material.

24:16.272 --> 24:19.516
I was going to ask that when you were talking about the Indian stuff.

24:20.057 --> 24:24.302
And then when I came in, you were talking about a title of a book that had the word nigger in it.

24:24.422 --> 24:25.764
And I said, wow.

24:27.506 --> 24:37.238
So again, how the perception of black has changed in the white society and how it is also in the black society.

24:37.657 --> 24:38.198
Well, sure.

24:38.378 --> 24:45.911
They probably called themselves Negroes and everything, you know.

24:45.931 --> 24:46.552
Well, that's great.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.215
I think I'm going to knock on the steps.

24:48.235 --> 24:49.878
Let's start again, please.

24:49.898 --> 24:50.880
You set up a foundation.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.863
I set up a fund, not a foundation.

24:52.903 --> 24:53.805
A fund, I'm sorry.

24:53.825 --> 24:58.152
To buy Greek children's books for the Greeks, for the Gernalius Library.

24:58.172 --> 25:01.658
It's a library in Greece, which I'm associated with.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.141
And...

25:04.167 --> 25:05.088
It's very difficult.

25:05.108 --> 25:06.891
There are no Greek children's books saved.

25:07.051 --> 25:09.755
You know, the paper was so poor from 1822.

25:09.915 --> 25:15.223
And before 1822 was saved, because it was Turkish.

25:15.243 --> 25:15.503
That's right.

25:16.285 --> 25:26.880
And during the war, I'm looking, I'm doing it, you know, how the children, you know, fell between the cracks or fell, period.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.866
And so I've set up this fund, and it's very difficult to buy children's books.

25:31.106 --> 25:32.708
And it's operating out of Greece?

25:32.909 --> 25:33.870
Yeah, it's in Athens, yeah.

25:34.508 --> 25:35.252
And how's the joy?

25:35.272 --> 25:39.978
I haven't been able to spend the money.

25:40.079 --> 25:41.245
I'll see you.
