00:01.735 --> 00:05.200
I did my exercise this morning at the hotel.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.582
I was a good guy.

00:06.763 --> 00:09.627
I got up at 6.30 and went up there on the treadmill.

00:09.747 --> 00:12.071
I should be embarrassed.

00:12.091 --> 00:15.796
I didn't want to get up, I'll tell you.

00:15.816 --> 00:23.828
You know, these tours, you get to a hotel late at night, you tend to send down for a pizza or something, you know?

00:23.848 --> 00:24.209
Or whatever.

00:24.790 --> 00:28.796
Just anything that comes quick, you go to sleep, you know?

00:29.076 --> 00:30.358
Is the tour just starting now?

00:31.115 --> 00:38.706
I started in New York City Monday night, and I flew to Washington that very night.

00:38.767 --> 00:45.657
I got to bed at 1 o'clock and had a 6.30 television the next morning.

00:45.677 --> 00:49.663
So it's been New York, Washington, Boston, and I go to Detroit tonight.

00:49.863 --> 00:51.465
Well, this should be pretty interesting.

00:51.485 --> 00:55.190
I'm sure it's Dutch-landed country out there.

00:56.311 --> 00:57.152
He's a good writer.

00:57.273 --> 00:57.853
He is good.

00:57.893 --> 01:01.097
I just met him a couple of weeks ago.

01:01.117 --> 01:02.719
I once wrote him a letter.

01:05.002 --> 01:12.152
I forget which book it was, and I told him how much I admired him.

01:12.232 --> 01:14.314
And he wrote back, and he said, the feelings are mutual.

01:14.334 --> 01:16.377
He said...

01:16.660 --> 01:19.786
He said, I have a feeling we're both working the same side of the street.

01:21.149 --> 01:21.850
He's a good writer.

01:22.111 --> 01:24.134
He's a terrific writer.

01:24.255 --> 01:25.998
You're a great writer.

01:26.399 --> 01:29.465
This is the first 710 years.

01:29.725 --> 01:30.567
Ten years.

01:30.587 --> 01:33.252
How come?

01:34.784 --> 01:38.008
I mean, you've been working your butt off, of course.

01:38.028 --> 01:41.112
Yeah, I've been trying to put A. McBain on the map.

01:41.212 --> 01:43.855
It's been prolific enough, but... Yeah, he's a bestseller now.

01:43.875 --> 01:48.701
He's a bestseller, and I have to struggle.

01:48.721 --> 01:49.422
That's a great line.

01:50.183 --> 01:53.627
You know, I always come into these things looking for my lead and looking for my kicker.

01:53.768 --> 01:56.050
You just gave me my last sentence of the piece.

01:56.631 --> 01:58.113
Great, all right, let's get the lead now.

01:59.154 --> 02:03.019
I wrote a book called Lizzie, about Lizzie Gordon.

02:03.691 --> 02:11.662
I spent two years researching and writing that.

02:11.702 --> 02:14.526
What was the attraction to that story?

02:14.546 --> 02:19.192
That's a mind that has been plumbed, certainly.

02:19.212 --> 02:27.143
Well, Evan Hunter writes about conflict, you know, generational conflict, man-woman conflict.

02:27.384 --> 02:28.485
I'm jumping around.

02:28.505 --> 02:31.309
This seems to be a very big generational conflict.

02:31.329 --> 02:32.010
Certainly, yes.

02:32.530 --> 02:35.193
woman takes a hatchet, and it's a father and a stepmother.

02:37.396 --> 02:45.285
So I wanted to know, I wasn't so terribly interested in whodunit, you know, it wasn't a mystery novel.

02:46.146 --> 02:50.872
I just wanted to know what were the forces at work in that house that caused this explosion.

02:51.212 --> 02:57.079
And to put it in a nutshell, it was a flop.

02:58.741 --> 03:00.023
Another book,

03:00.593 --> 03:02.536
The title Lizzie came out at the same time.

03:02.576 --> 03:03.837
Non-fiction.

03:04.158 --> 03:04.578
I remember.

03:05.740 --> 03:06.821
They were reviewed together.

03:07.522 --> 03:12.669
I found myself very appearing on shows with this guy.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.693
We were like Siamese twins, showing at the hip.

03:16.754 --> 03:17.455
I didn't need him.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.376
He needed me.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.542
But as a result, neither one of them went anywhere.

03:22.682 --> 03:23.583
Not his book or mine.

03:23.643 --> 03:25.646
And his book was non-fiction, as I recollect.

03:25.666 --> 03:28.590
It might have even been a random house book.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.212
It was non-fiction and...

03:30.395 --> 03:32.799
But his premise was that her sister did it.

03:32.859 --> 03:35.164
Yeah, I don't think he came up with it.

03:35.224 --> 03:37.368
It was all circumstantial, right?

03:37.528 --> 03:38.149
Oh, bullshit.

03:38.289 --> 03:40.593
It was all bullshit.

03:40.613 --> 03:43.018
I mean, did this kind of sound?

03:44.340 --> 03:47.225
Were you up for a while?

03:47.245 --> 03:54.799
Well, I thought, you know, I figured in America you can write about whatever you want to write, and if you're a good writer.

03:55.353 --> 04:00.257
the book should have a shot at it, especially when you spend so much time.

04:00.277 --> 04:02.880
And I said, the hell with this.

04:02.980 --> 04:04.601
I'm going to back off for a while.

04:06.223 --> 04:09.306
And this was the book following Love, Dad, which was a bestseller.

04:11.187 --> 04:17.513
That was an interesting book that came right at the end of the Vietnam Nightmare, and it happened about losing his daughter.

04:17.954 --> 04:20.436
That was another generational conflict, too, wasn't it?

04:20.456 --> 04:20.556
Yeah.

04:20.776 --> 04:22.778
I still meet in...

04:23.078 --> 04:26.463
Washington.

04:26.684 --> 04:33.755
A woman came, that was in New York, Monday night.

04:34.156 --> 04:38.583
A woman, about 34, 35, came over to me.

04:40.846 --> 04:44.372
And she said, there's a copy of Love, Dad.

04:44.612 --> 04:49.159
And she said, my sister and I send this back and forth.

04:49.179 --> 04:50.301
She lives in L.A.

04:50.568 --> 04:53.698
back and forth across the country every other month.

04:55.102 --> 05:02.526
She said, this is when we need our fix to remind us of our love for our father and all that.

05:03.489 --> 05:04.392
She must have been

05:04.608 --> 05:06.051
1980-whatever.

05:06.351 --> 05:06.632
Sure.

05:06.772 --> 05:07.574
81, we think.

05:07.594 --> 05:08.756
That was 13 years ago.

05:08.776 --> 05:12.503
But she was... Something like that.

05:12.523 --> 05:14.367
So she was a kid of six years.

05:14.447 --> 05:14.908
Yeah.

05:15.088 --> 05:20.279
And she and her sister send the book back and forth across the country to read and re-read.

05:20.299 --> 05:21.120
That makes you feel good.

05:21.241 --> 05:21.882
It really does.

05:22.463 --> 05:26.110
I got a lot of letters on Love Dad from women who...

05:26.090 --> 05:28.394
who had had troubled relationships with their father.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.519
But that went beyond the relationships.

05:31.719 --> 05:35.005
Again, I remember it now going back in time.

05:35.025 --> 05:39.172
You felt that we almost lost a generation.

05:39.252 --> 05:43.519
I think it was one of the lines you gave me was one of the premises.

05:43.539 --> 05:45.302
Maybe we're jumping around here.

05:45.322 --> 05:46.244
It's all right.

05:46.985 --> 05:47.085
Sure.

05:47.403 --> 05:51.650
So then you decided, well, all right, let's get McBain going.

05:51.670 --> 05:52.831
Let's concentrate on McBain.

05:52.851 --> 05:53.372
He's really well.

05:53.592 --> 05:56.016
He's got his following, which was solid.

05:56.036 --> 05:57.899
It's always been a very solid following.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.403
But not bestseller, proportionally.

06:00.423 --> 06:02.045
You wanted to crank him up a tad, right?

06:02.065 --> 06:02.827
A cult.

06:02.847 --> 06:04.249
It was a cult following.

06:05.691 --> 06:14.845
And we started convincing my publishers that it wasn't enough to just...

06:14.825 --> 06:24.561
raise sales by a thousand copies each time out, because then I'd be 92 years old when I hit the bestseller list.

06:24.581 --> 06:27.826
Was this an ego thing, or was it a money thing?

06:27.987 --> 06:37.963
No, it was... You see, I knew how good I was, and I knew the ones who were inferior on the bestseller list, and I thought, this is not fair.

06:38.821 --> 06:41.385
I'm not saying that life has to be fair.

06:42.186 --> 06:42.947
We all know.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.228
Your mother teaches you that.

06:44.248 --> 06:46.351
Who says it has to be fair?

06:46.371 --> 06:59.850
But it really disturbed me that so many inferior mystery writers in a burgeoning mystery market, you know, mysties now are

07:00.218 --> 07:01.279
Almost respectable.

07:01.399 --> 07:04.483
Five out of ten are the best dollars for mysteries.

07:04.603 --> 07:09.909
Beyond sales, I think even as a writing form, I mean, people respect the writers.

07:09.929 --> 07:15.055
They're not dismissed as genre hack, shall we say.

07:15.635 --> 07:16.196
I know.

07:17.017 --> 07:18.538
And it bothered me.

07:18.558 --> 07:22.623
I remember a talk we had on my publishers.

07:22.683 --> 07:23.284
I said, you know.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.327
Who was the host, by the way, at that point?

07:26.347 --> 07:27.188
William Morrow.

07:28.163 --> 07:30.305
And I said, we had a meeting.

07:32.307 --> 07:35.350
And I said, there were a lot of contractors coming up to redo it.

07:37.071 --> 07:41.575
How many McBanes had you done to that point, would you say, approximately?

07:41.595 --> 07:43.677
This was, I guess, was Lullaby.

07:43.977 --> 07:45.058
So whenever that was.

07:45.078 --> 07:45.899
Okay, it's a Lullaby.

07:45.919 --> 07:47.340
I'll check it out.

07:47.360 --> 07:55.808
I said, a lot of critics in the world believe I'm the best mystery writer there is.

07:57.593 --> 08:00.977
I said, and a lot of publishers in New York believe that too.

08:02.518 --> 08:12.389
I said, and if you don't believe it, then let me go to another publisher who does believe it and who will let the people know about it.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.793
And they said, no, we do believe it.

08:15.813 --> 08:16.774
And what do you want?

08:16.814 --> 08:18.656
And I told them, I want to be a bestseller.

08:19.737 --> 08:22.420
And I want you to get behind me and do what it, you know how to do it.

08:22.838 --> 08:23.979
You know how to make bestsellers.

08:24.059 --> 08:28.685
Every publisher in the world knows how to make a bestseller, if they want to.

08:29.105 --> 08:29.766
No question.

08:29.966 --> 08:34.372
Whether it comes to discounting books or going out and... Advertising.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.875
Putting together a $250,000 ad budget.

08:36.995 --> 08:37.415
Whatever.

08:37.515 --> 08:44.383
Going out and making sure that they're a stack of... They know how to do it.

08:44.564 --> 08:45.264
It's not a mystery.

08:45.304 --> 08:47.047
They know how to do it.

08:47.147 --> 08:50.010
They will invariably say, well, this is...

08:50.530 --> 08:51.812
We can't make a bestseller.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.553
It's out of my hands.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.515
How do you make a bestseller?

08:55.238 --> 08:57.221
But they know how to do it when they want to.

08:57.241 --> 09:00.867
Now, were you doing this yourself, or did you have your agent in there?

09:00.887 --> 09:03.011
My agent was my wife.

09:03.332 --> 09:07.779
My wife took an active interest in my career.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.223
And she's a very good businesswoman.

09:12.888 --> 09:14.310
She's a beautiful woman.

09:14.493 --> 09:16.255
My wife's the same way.

09:16.275 --> 09:20.601
She's marketing my call, and I'm letting her set the prices and do the whole work with me.

09:20.641 --> 09:23.344
She's hard-headed when she has to be and hard-nosed.

09:23.564 --> 09:29.512
And she says things in meetings that I can't say without sounding a modern.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.796
She says them.

09:33.897 --> 09:36.901
And we got on the list.

09:37.061 --> 09:40.825
We finally started paying paperback, hardcover, and then paperback.

09:41.226 --> 09:42.087
So we're on the list again.

09:42.421 --> 09:44.123
McBean is on the list.

09:44.143 --> 09:44.404
No.

09:44.824 --> 09:45.866
You've moved a couple of times.

09:45.886 --> 09:46.967
Warner Books.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.070
Warner is doing the McBeans?

09:49.130 --> 09:49.491
Everything.

09:50.392 --> 09:53.296
Because I knew that you'd spread yourself around there for a while.

09:53.316 --> 09:56.481
I remember about Love Dad was Crown, as I recollect.

09:56.621 --> 09:58.964
Crown turned down to Lizzie.

09:58.984 --> 09:59.806
This was another thing.

10:00.286 --> 10:02.850
Love Dad was a bestseller.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.053
And I told him what I wanted to write about.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.776
Such a great story.

10:08.316 --> 10:14.322
It's the father-daughter thing from love-dad, only pressed to the further limits.

10:16.365 --> 10:23.212
They listened, and then they said, we're not going to offer.

10:23.232 --> 10:24.273
It's a death world, isn't it?

10:24.293 --> 10:24.753
It's business.

10:24.773 --> 10:25.774
It's something, isn't it?

10:25.794 --> 10:28.337
I was totally astonished.

10:29.338 --> 10:32.221
Totally astonished.

10:32.241 --> 10:33.522
It's a bit funny over there.

10:34.075 --> 10:35.357
I mean, they're funny, isn't it?

10:35.457 --> 10:38.081
Of course, they weren't owned by Random House yet at that point.

10:38.101 --> 10:39.042
Well, publishers are funny.

10:39.062 --> 10:40.444
That's what I mean, is what I'm saying.

10:40.885 --> 10:45.712
See, Waters has a very big commitment in that.

10:46.433 --> 10:51.701
They published one of the Matthew Hope novels, you know, The Attorney, Mary Mary.

10:51.721 --> 10:53.063
That's out in paperback now.

10:53.103 --> 10:55.526
They published it last year.

10:55.546 --> 10:57.990
They're publishing Criminal Conversations.

10:58.713 --> 11:02.377
I finished the second of the Matthew Hopes under a contract.

11:04.119 --> 11:15.411
They have bought two 87 Precinct novels, and they're bringing out at Christmas time an 87 Precinct story boxed Christmas Eve at the 87 Precinct.

11:15.611 --> 11:16.953
That's great.

11:16.973 --> 11:19.856
So they have a really substantial commitment to me.

11:19.876 --> 11:24.340
Well, there are three of you.

11:24.360 --> 11:24.641
Sure, three.

11:24.721 --> 11:27.724
Have you ever resolved why that's necessary for you?

11:29.037 --> 11:35.624
Well, who's the third?

11:37.667 --> 11:39.028
Matthew Hope is the character.

11:39.869 --> 11:40.530
That's McBain.

11:41.271 --> 11:41.991
He's the character.

11:42.011 --> 11:43.073
He's a lawyer.

11:44.054 --> 11:46.276
It's the books with all the fairy tales.

11:46.637 --> 11:50.220
You had me confused there.

11:50.281 --> 11:51.602
I know, it does get too hard.

11:51.886 --> 11:52.406
I'm sorry.

11:52.507 --> 11:57.911
It confuses me sometimes, too.

11:58.852 --> 12:03.276
But I have to keep them separate in my own... I think you have used other names, however.

12:03.496 --> 12:04.537
Oh, yeah, in the past.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.037
In the past.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.539
So it's just two that you used.

12:07.059 --> 12:07.239
Yeah.

12:07.259 --> 12:07.480
Okay.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.581
Just my own name.

12:08.601 --> 12:11.303
This has been my name since, you know, 1953.

12:11.323 --> 12:13.305
It's a long time.

12:13.365 --> 12:16.187
What are some of the other names you've written on them?

12:16.207 --> 12:16.868
Kurt Cannon.

12:17.508 --> 12:17.869
Kurt?

12:18.089 --> 12:19.170
Kurt Cannon.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.632
With a K or a C. C-U-R-T, Cannon.

12:21.692 --> 12:21.792
Yeah.

12:21.923 --> 12:32.941
Richard Marston, which was my three sons, Richard, Mark, and Penn.

12:33.202 --> 12:35.305
Ezra Hammond.

12:37.569 --> 12:43.459
When I began writing, I was writing for the pulp magazines.

12:44.114 --> 12:48.043
And I would sometimes have three or four stories in the same edition.

12:48.163 --> 12:50.549
And the editors didn't even know.

12:50.569 --> 12:56.843
I worked for a literary agency, so I would just send them stories by me under different names, and they bought them.

12:58.005 --> 12:59.308
They liked them, and they bought them.

13:00.170 --> 13:00.992
And then...

13:01.360 --> 13:09.491
On occasion, like Ezra Hammond, I want to start a new series, and I couldn't use McBain on it.

13:09.511 --> 13:10.312
It's a crisis.

13:10.372 --> 13:15.580
I couldn't use McBain because the name was under contract, so I invented another name.

13:15.600 --> 13:20.847
For practical reasons as well.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.788
Yeah.

13:21.848 --> 13:23.731
But now it's just McBain and me.

13:23.751 --> 13:26.895
Me and Ed.

13:27.112 --> 13:31.477
I mean, I don't know.

13:31.517 --> 13:34.020
I don't know.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.102
I don't know.

13:36.823 --> 13:40.487
I don't know.

13:41.808 --> 13:44.211
I don't know.

13:44.451 --> 13:45.372
I don't know.

13:45.953 --> 13:52.360
I don't know.

13:52.610 --> 13:54.572
which was with Morrow there for a while.

13:54.672 --> 13:56.534
It was before Morrow, right?

13:56.554 --> 13:58.136
Then Arbor House became Morrow.

13:58.216 --> 13:59.257
And now it's gone in time.

13:59.277 --> 14:00.438
And the contract went over to Morrow.

14:01.099 --> 14:06.445
But Don Fine was the editor there and the publisher.

14:08.047 --> 14:12.852
And he bought, I think it was 287 Precinct Home, the first of which was going to be Ice.

14:14.333 --> 14:19.399
And he said, I think you have to reintroduce this series to the public.

14:19.699 --> 14:21.661
This was supposed to be the bread tune on it.

14:21.681 --> 14:22.482
It was a very good one.

14:23.086 --> 14:28.212
Newsweek chose it as one of the top ten crime novels of the 20th century.

14:28.632 --> 14:28.812
Ice.

14:30.174 --> 14:30.694
No kidding.

14:30.714 --> 14:30.975
Yeah.

14:31.796 --> 14:32.056
Yeah.

14:32.516 --> 14:33.437
It was a good, good book.

14:33.718 --> 14:38.283
He said, reintroduce all the characters as if no one has ever met them before.

14:38.303 --> 14:38.463
Wow.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.166
Reintroduce them and write a big, fat novel.

14:41.186 --> 14:41.566
And I did.

14:42.027 --> 14:43.829
And it was a good, complicated plot.

14:44.730 --> 14:48.714
And all the increasing characters come in for the first time.

14:48.734 --> 14:51.678
We've seen them with fresh eyes.

14:51.698 --> 14:53.059
But it didn't become a bestseller.

14:54.473 --> 15:01.905
And Arbor House was just slogging along, and so was Morrow, and they inherited the mantle until we got tough.

15:03.568 --> 15:06.853
But I was writing, I was really writing up a storm.

15:07.173 --> 15:20.194
The books in that, starting with ICE, where at the end of ICE, street justice trials, not the police, street justice.

15:21.001 --> 15:28.112
I began thinking of the police novel as maybe something more than just cops and robbers and whodunit.

15:28.132 --> 15:34.141
Something where I could confront social issues, the way you do in a straight novel.

15:34.502 --> 15:37.787
You can speak justice in here, too, by the way.

15:37.807 --> 15:38.367
Oh, yeah, isn't it?

15:38.428 --> 15:40.050
Pardon me for interrupting.

15:41.212 --> 15:41.893
Go ahead.

15:41.913 --> 15:46.299
I mean, speak justice of a fashion, I would say, certainly.

15:46.320 --> 15:46.660
Go ahead.

15:46.680 --> 15:46.880
I'm sorry.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.942
We'll get to this in a minute.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.945
Oh, sure.

15:50.701 --> 15:57.971
So I started thinking in terms of elevating the mystery novel to a new level.

15:57.991 --> 16:06.623
You know, you go along, you go along, you go along, and you reach a plateau, and then you either stay there and become a hack, or you go up.

16:07.224 --> 16:08.305
You take a shot up.

16:09.066 --> 16:11.970
And that's what I tried to do with the 87 Precinct.

16:11.990 --> 16:13.292
I guess challenging yourself.

16:13.312 --> 16:14.734
I mean, the bestseller thing...

16:16.300 --> 16:22.429
was more than, I mean, I have to believe that it was more than the remunitive element.

16:22.449 --> 16:27.817
You really did want to elevate the game a bit, however old you were at that particular point.

16:27.877 --> 16:34.206
You said, all right, I'm doing fine, I'm living well, but now it's time to... Time to give it another little surge with the rockets.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.250
Time to go into that orbit.

16:37.310 --> 16:38.111
That's right.

16:38.131 --> 16:38.772
Get up there.

16:38.852 --> 16:39.233
Take it.

16:39.393 --> 16:41.476
Around the moon.

16:41.937 --> 16:44.060
Give it that... Hit the thrusters.

16:44.521 --> 16:45.582
Go to warp eight.

16:45.950 --> 16:48.173
Dr. Spock, Mr. Spock.

16:48.193 --> 16:50.116
So clearly you've done that, and you've done that.

16:50.396 --> 16:50.817
I've done it.

16:50.837 --> 16:52.199
You've satisfied that you've done that.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.040
I've done it.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.884
And now it's time for Evan to reassert himself.

16:55.904 --> 16:58.307
Come back, yeah, before it's too late.

17:00.009 --> 17:01.211
Ten years is a long time.

17:01.231 --> 17:05.797
You know, it goes by, it goes by, and you think, oh, the time's not.

17:05.857 --> 17:08.641
And then suddenly it's ten years between novels.

17:09.242 --> 17:09.342
Jeez.

17:09.541 --> 17:13.665
And if you're looking, it's 40 years since Blackboard Jungle, coincidentally.

17:13.685 --> 17:14.486
44-0, yeah.

17:14.506 --> 17:15.106
54 to 94.

17:15.186 --> 17:16.528
Yeah, 40 years.

17:17.128 --> 17:19.550
Was it that playing factor at all, you're thinking this?

17:19.571 --> 17:23.334
I mean, were you doing some sort of... No, no.

17:24.315 --> 17:27.398
Not in terms of an anniversary, no.

17:31.862 --> 17:35.406
So talk to me about how this thing came into being.

17:35.426 --> 17:36.406
It started in Boston.

17:37.548 --> 17:39.109
I was on a tour.

17:39.933 --> 17:45.105
Must have been with Kiss, which was a New York Times best friend, Nick Bain.

17:46.508 --> 17:51.881
And I was going back to New York, and I met a lawyer on the plane, a woman lawyer.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.848
And we got to talking.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.632
I told her about this character I write.

17:56.652 --> 17:57.975
Matthew Hope was a lawyer.

17:58.225 --> 18:08.549
And we started discussing the archaic legal terms that descended from British law.

18:08.630 --> 18:12.138
And she said, how about criminal conversation as one of them?

18:12.158 --> 18:13.722
I said, what is that?

18:13.742 --> 18:15.205
And she said, it means adultery.

18:16.838 --> 18:22.325
I'm amazed that some of these other lawyer guys who come up with all these crazes didn't come across that one.

18:22.345 --> 18:22.746
I know.

18:22.906 --> 18:24.588
Thank God I got to them first.

18:24.608 --> 18:28.293
Because that's the rage, you know, to get these.

18:28.473 --> 18:29.094
Go ahead.

18:29.154 --> 18:34.001
Before these amateurs who are in the writing game got to it, I grabbed it out of the air.

18:34.582 --> 18:37.405
We've got to talk about the amateurs at some point.

18:37.486 --> 18:41.511
I'm going to write it down so we don't forget.

18:41.531 --> 18:41.631
Okay.

18:42.758 --> 18:48.789
And then I thought, you know, I wanted a good idea for a novel about adultery.

18:50.151 --> 18:56.041
And then I thought, wouldn't it be interesting, in fact, if the woman is having an affair with a criminal?

18:58.445 --> 19:00.048
That's a classic theme, too, isn't it?

19:00.068 --> 19:06.319
And then I said, wouldn't it be great if her DA husband is investigating this criminal?

19:06.468 --> 19:12.235
and is listening to real criminal conversations, is wiretapping real criminal conversations.

19:12.255 --> 19:14.117
And then I had the whole book.

19:14.177 --> 19:15.539
It just fell into place.

19:15.859 --> 19:28.213
All I needed to set it in motion was a bullshit arrest on a minor little thing at the tip of the iceberg that suddenly turns into mob stuff.

19:28.954 --> 19:34.340
And when you've got a dedicated DA who starts digging, what is this?

19:34.360 --> 19:35.242
Where are we going?

19:35.262 --> 19:35.682
Where are we going?

19:35.797 --> 19:38.741
It didn't bother you about the perception of it being prepped.

19:38.761 --> 19:46.310
It's just a bit too coincidental that the guy's life is... No, I didn't think of it that way.

19:46.330 --> 19:48.693
In fact, you know, you got to work to make it believable.

19:49.594 --> 19:51.917
But I didn't think it was coincidental.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.639
I felt it could happen.

19:53.759 --> 19:54.240
It happens.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.202
And of course, if this guy's...

19:56.182 --> 20:02.896
When I was working with the... People move in circles, and then they do tend to intersect at a certain point.

20:02.916 --> 20:03.377
Yeah.

20:03.638 --> 20:03.998
I think.

20:04.239 --> 20:04.800
Oh, yeah.

20:04.820 --> 20:05.702
What you're saying here.

20:05.742 --> 20:11.895
And I thought, you know, in talking to all the DAs and everything, many of them are married, and many of them...

20:12.314 --> 20:16.218
um, socialize with other people.

20:16.238 --> 20:20.662
And I specifically asked, do you say what you do in his office?

20:20.682 --> 20:21.182
And they don't.

20:22.924 --> 20:27.388
First of all, they're involved with sensitive investigation.

20:27.408 --> 20:33.013
Secondly, as I mentioned in the book, one of them said, you know, I've been to parties where pot is being smoked.

20:33.734 --> 20:34.435
What am I going to do?

20:34.575 --> 20:36.717
Bust him?

20:36.737 --> 20:36.917
You know?

20:36.937 --> 20:38.919
That's right.

20:38.939 --> 20:39.199
That's right.

20:39.618 --> 20:42.021
So they keep it a secret.

20:42.041 --> 20:47.588
So it was believable that she would be keeping her husband's identity a secret from the lover.

20:48.549 --> 20:52.254
It's believable that he doesn't want her to know that he's a gangster.

20:52.354 --> 20:54.657
And the husband doesn't know what the hell's going on.

20:54.737 --> 20:58.602
You know, he doesn't know who the woman is that he's hearing on these tapes.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.646
Because the quality of these tapes is not on that grip.

21:01.666 --> 21:05.170
That's the ultimate schmuck.

21:05.622 --> 21:11.170
Well, the quality of these tapes is not the best.

21:11.190 --> 21:18.702
I mean, to get into a technical sense, I mean, she's performing at a level... Higher than he has known.

21:18.722 --> 21:21.446
...that he's ever known.

21:21.706 --> 21:22.147
Exactly.

21:22.187 --> 21:25.131
Which is one of the attractions of the other guy.

21:27.014 --> 21:32.322
Again, I can't admit to having read your whole body of work...

21:32.639 --> 21:34.562
How many books all together is it?

21:34.722 --> 21:36.445
Hunter Novels, this is number 19.

21:36.585 --> 21:37.046
Okay.

21:37.246 --> 21:40.932
And the McBanes, I think about 60 or so, maybe more.

21:40.953 --> 21:42.174
Wow, okay.

21:42.315 --> 21:44.618
But is this about the sexiest you've got?

21:44.638 --> 21:45.039
I think so.

21:46.602 --> 21:52.732
Of what I've read, I mean, you really... Yeah, I've written, like, poetic sex scenes.

21:52.792 --> 21:55.977
I mean, you wouldn't want your 12-year-old kid to read it.

21:55.997 --> 21:58.541
No, it's dedicated to my daughter.

21:58.561 --> 21:59.162
She's 31.

21:59.262 --> 21:59.743
Okay.

22:00.128 --> 22:22.862
and before i dedicated i called them i said amanda uh i've written a book it's very very sexy i said i want to dedicate it to you because i love you a lot and i haven't dedicated a book to you since you were 11 years old i said if it's going to embarrass you i don't want to do it i said i'm going to send you the manuscript

22:23.264 --> 22:28.553
And if it embarrasses you in the slightest, you let me know and I'll dedicate it to someone else.

22:28.573 --> 22:35.184
And she called me and she said, Dad, I'd be proud to have this book dedicated to you.

22:35.244 --> 22:36.185
That's nice, huh?

22:36.205 --> 22:37.487
Yeah, it was really nice.

22:37.568 --> 22:40.072
It made me think, boy, I raised a mensch.

22:40.132 --> 22:41.634
I raised a real woman.

22:41.654 --> 22:42.376
How did you feel?

22:42.576 --> 22:46.302
You know, I mean, again, 87th Precinct stuff is...

22:46.822 --> 22:48.024
You know, police stuff.

22:48.044 --> 22:49.546
How did you feel about getting into this?

22:50.046 --> 22:51.288
Gangster stuff?

22:51.408 --> 22:54.473
Well, not just the gangster stuff, but I mean the bedroom stuff.

22:54.493 --> 22:55.474
The bedroom stuff?

22:55.494 --> 22:55.915
Right.

22:55.935 --> 23:01.943
See, in the 87 precinct, Cruella never has sex with anyone except his wife.

23:01.963 --> 23:03.625
He doesn't go gay at an age either.

23:04.066 --> 23:05.768
No, never.

23:05.788 --> 23:09.193
But women are always hitting on him, but he never responds.

23:09.453 --> 23:12.558
He comes close to responding, but he never does.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.782
I got a letter once from a woman...

23:16.167 --> 23:26.359
I wrote a book called Ghosts, in which there's a psychic who can tell things by touching clothes and going into a trance.

23:27.140 --> 23:40.476
And Corella has been with the victim, close to the victims, and she grabs him and kisses him, suddenly, so she can get the vibrations.

23:41.598 --> 23:46.123
And he tells Teddy about it that night, and he says, I didn't kiss her.

23:46.643 --> 23:47.946
She grabbed, she kissed me.

23:49.128 --> 23:54.419
I got a letter from a lot of women.

23:54.439 --> 24:04.720
The gist of it was, I don't care what Teddy believes, but it takes two to tango.

24:05.122 --> 24:08.567
And he'd better not ever do it again.

24:09.608 --> 24:15.356
And boy, I believed they would come to my door with an act if I did, you know, if Cruella ever was unfaithful.

24:15.697 --> 24:20.464
Tell me about getting into this now.

24:20.484 --> 24:28.615
The difference in the 87th precinct, an editor years ago said that the books had what he called clinical verity.

24:29.253 --> 24:40.569
And, like, the sex in the 87 precinct would be, like, more concerned with the presence of sperm in the vaginal hole.

24:40.589 --> 24:41.671
Forensic.

24:41.691 --> 24:41.791
Yeah.

24:42.191 --> 24:42.892
Exactly.

24:42.912 --> 24:49.582
Whether the woman had been raped or not.

24:49.622 --> 24:49.742
Right.

24:50.262 --> 25:07.217
because of certain writers in the genre, and because of the pulp background where intimated sex was always a necessity in the story, a given.

25:07.237 --> 25:19.948
You know, you always had the gartered silk stockings showing below the hem of the skirt when she crossed her legs, and the low-cut blouses exposing creamy white breasts, you know.

25:20.890 --> 25:22.793
You get some of that in here, as a matter of fact.

25:23.995 --> 25:24.717
Not so much.

25:24.777 --> 25:26.700
Well, I mean, the teasing.

25:26.720 --> 25:35.215
But I mean, the teasing, the language, that one scene where she's driving him nuts where she's hugging her thighs.

25:35.235 --> 25:35.716
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:35.916 --> 25:36.497
That's a good scene.

25:36.517 --> 25:37.980
That's a great scene.

25:38.160 --> 25:42.107
You notice, by the way, did you notice that all of these scenes are written from the female viewpoint?

25:43.169 --> 25:43.810
Every one of them.

25:44.363 --> 25:48.529
Not a single scene is from Andrew's view, always from Sarah's.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.791
Now that was a challenge for you.

25:49.811 --> 25:55.198
I never even realized it until I started rereading the book.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.363
I got a few tricks here I want to show too, I think.

25:58.383 --> 26:01.247
Oh yeah, I want to show the kids, the new kids on the block, how to do it.

26:01.788 --> 26:02.288
You feel that?

26:02.308 --> 26:03.570
The amateurs, yeah.

26:03.837 --> 26:04.318
Sure.

26:05.601 --> 26:07.305
You know, I've learned a few things over here.

26:07.365 --> 26:15.404
Let's get back to the sex thing and get back to this, because this is very... So I thought... You don't mind my jumping around like this.

26:15.424 --> 26:17.568
Believe me, when I transcribe, it's all very quick.

26:17.689 --> 26:23.061
It sounds like the tapes I listen to, you know, the transcripts, the guys are all jumping around for one.

26:23.041 --> 26:29.108
I transcribe these at night when the writing time is over.

26:29.768 --> 26:30.389
We have plenty.

26:30.409 --> 26:31.590
11 o'clock.

26:31.731 --> 26:40.861
I had written a previous book about adultery.

26:40.881 --> 26:41.982
Strange is one of these.

26:42.002 --> 26:45.305
It's made in two movies with Kirk Douglas and Kim Dover.

26:45.386 --> 26:47.368
That was 56 or something like that.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.409
That was 58.

26:48.609 --> 26:49.470
Tame stuff.

26:49.737 --> 26:58.467
And I thought, you know, if you're going to write about adultery, people in the bedroom don't go there to sip tea.

27:00.409 --> 27:00.710
You know?

27:01.551 --> 27:08.899
And adulterers, you don't normally see them in restaurants, unless it's out of the way places.

27:08.999 --> 27:11.322
Ironically, the restaurant doesn't come in at the end.

27:11.382 --> 27:13.705
Let me tell you a funny story.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.627
This is off the record.

27:15.792 --> 27:30.154
A friend of mine, speaking of adultery, his next-door neighbor, they have a dog, and his next-door neighbor said, if that dog comes in my yard ever again, I'm going to poison him.

27:31.116 --> 27:35.783
You better put him on a cane and keep him far away from my yard, because he was strolling into the other guy's yard.

27:36.283 --> 27:38.627
He said, I swear to you, I'll poison him.

27:39.518 --> 27:45.524
He and his wife went away to a place in the country for the weekend.

27:45.745 --> 27:55.796
And there, sitting at a table with a bimbo, is the Victor neighbor with a blonde bimbo.

27:55.816 --> 28:00.641
And my friend said, I saw him and he saw me.

28:02.843 --> 28:06.387
And I gave him, he said, I put an eye lock on him.

28:07.210 --> 28:11.014
I gave him such an eye lock so he'd known I saw him.

28:11.655 --> 28:18.103
Then, as a souvenir of the place, they took photographs and put them on little keychains.

28:19.304 --> 28:21.487
And they were all on a table.

28:21.507 --> 28:24.370
And you had to go get the keychain, find your photograph, and take it.

28:24.430 --> 28:25.972
And they had a picture of him in the bimbo.

28:26.873 --> 28:33.801
And my friend, my friend ran to the table.

28:33.821 --> 28:36.424
And the other guy is running to the table at the same time.

28:36.910 --> 28:40.093
And my friend is looking not for his key, for the other key.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.955
He grabs the key, and he goes to him.

28:44.377 --> 28:48.621
Never heard another word about the dog ever, ever, ever.

28:48.641 --> 28:49.541
Funny, adultery.

28:49.942 --> 28:51.363
You can use that in a book.

28:51.383 --> 28:51.683
I know.

28:54.866 --> 28:55.307
Getting back.

28:55.327 --> 28:56.007
Right, getting back.

28:56.928 --> 29:06.917
So I figured, you know, Picasso, when he reached a certain age, started painting erotic pictures.

29:07.235 --> 29:10.180
Why not do some good erotic themes?

29:10.260 --> 29:12.485
Oh, you remember the Andrew Wyeth paintings?

29:12.665 --> 29:13.306
I beg your pardon?

29:13.326 --> 29:16.091
Do you remember the Andrew Wyeth paintings of a couple of years ago?

29:16.111 --> 29:16.432
Oh, of course.

29:16.452 --> 29:17.574
What Helga?

29:17.594 --> 29:21.300
I mean, I said, my God, well, what are you doing all these years up in the barn?

29:21.441 --> 29:22.723
Yeah, paint the Helga.

29:22.823 --> 29:26.189
He was doing Helga.

29:26.209 --> 29:27.071
And that was amazing.

29:27.091 --> 29:28.413
That's an even better example.

29:28.714 --> 29:30.096
These are quite graphic.

29:30.116 --> 29:30.998
Anyway, go ahead.

29:31.214 --> 29:33.858
So I figured, oh, let's pull out all the stops.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.000
In this day and age, you can do anything you want to do.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.843
You weren't embarrassed at all at the beginning.

29:38.784 --> 29:40.887
Why would I be embarrassed?

29:40.907 --> 29:51.742
What embarrasses me is when I go to a movie theater, and everybody, every character in the movie, whether she's a housewife, a lawyer, a doctor, says fuck every third word.

29:51.762 --> 29:52.643
That embarrasses me.

29:52.683 --> 29:55.787
That embarrasses me, too.

29:55.953 --> 29:59.757
Because it's a gratuitous obscenity.

29:59.937 --> 30:01.679
My gangsters say fuck a lot.

30:01.739 --> 30:02.861
And cops say it a lot.

30:03.001 --> 30:06.004
Where it's appropriate for the scene.

30:06.084 --> 30:07.946
But here, everybody says that.

30:07.966 --> 30:14.414
In movies today, it's as if you've let the 12-year-olds out in the schoolyard and they can scream obscenity.

30:14.434 --> 30:16.276
The resolution is almost preordained.

30:16.296 --> 30:18.398
It's almost like a Romeo and Juliet thing.

30:18.418 --> 30:20.040
Yeah, I think so.

30:20.080 --> 30:20.961
Don't give it away.

30:21.001 --> 30:22.723
No, no, of course, I never do.

30:22.743 --> 30:23.884
It has to...

30:25.113 --> 30:27.597
It's inevitable.

30:27.977 --> 30:31.202
I almost knew it was going to be a restaurant, too.

30:31.222 --> 30:31.542
Did you?

30:31.963 --> 30:34.667
Well, that's where all the robots are.

30:35.127 --> 30:38.131
Plus the fact that they never go out, too.

30:39.093 --> 30:42.097
But the ironic nature of it.

30:42.117 --> 30:45.602
My daughter burst into tears when she got to that scene.

30:45.785 --> 31:01.448
Because oddly enough, even though it's a star-crossed match, and we know that they should never have started this damn thing, and they're all wrong for each other, the reader wants this passion to survive.

31:01.428 --> 31:06.036
For both of them, you know.

31:06.056 --> 31:07.058
He's great, he's great.

31:07.078 --> 31:09.462
He gives up the girlfriends, which is amazing.

31:10.324 --> 31:10.424
Yeah.

31:10.444 --> 31:15.132
He's a scoundrel, he's a rogue, you know, a scoundrel, and he reforms, he falls in love with them.

31:15.152 --> 31:15.252
Yeah.

31:15.432 --> 31:17.436
The last thing he wants to do on earth.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.039
He wants to marry you.

31:19.079 --> 31:19.379
Yeah.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.922
He wants you to leave his...

31:20.902 --> 31:23.785
But, you know, what are your alternate endings?

31:23.805 --> 31:24.826
What is she going to say?

31:25.467 --> 31:29.792
Yes, I'll marry you, and I'll wait for you while you're in prison for 20 years.

31:30.092 --> 31:31.113
No, no, no, I had to see.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.995
Or they come and they kill him.

31:33.536 --> 31:41.204
Now, this could almost, given the theme and the crime and stuff, you almost could have used elements of this in an enemy being had you chosen.

31:41.224 --> 31:41.925
I don't think so.

31:41.945 --> 31:50.875
I think in your writing a mystery, there's always a body to start it.

31:51.125 --> 31:53.367
The body is what kicks the plot into motion.

31:53.987 --> 31:55.849
And we're always concerned about whodunit.

31:56.490 --> 31:58.431
That's the contract you make with the reader.

31:59.372 --> 32:04.336
However many social issues you introduce, you can't get up on a soapbox too often.

32:05.998 --> 32:08.620
You've got to remember the contract always.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.603
So you have to understand that, you know, it's baseball.

32:11.623 --> 32:13.284
We've got to play by the rules of baseball.

32:13.304 --> 32:14.025
Exactly.

32:14.525 --> 32:16.187
Two different genres entirely.

32:16.227 --> 32:19.950
The straight novel and the... Did you feel the tug of doing something?

32:20.116 --> 32:24.362
I mean, do you consider this serious work as opposed to the other is not serious?

32:24.382 --> 32:27.266
No, I think of the mysteries as serious.

32:27.286 --> 32:33.776
But you see, I think, I know in my heart of hearts, I can write the best mystery in the universe.

32:33.816 --> 32:36.419
I can write the best 20 mysteries in the universe.

32:37.621 --> 32:40.685
I'm never going to get the Pulitzer Prize for a mystery, ever.

32:41.186 --> 32:42.588
I'm not going to get it for this either.

32:42.608 --> 32:49.498
I mean, I'm not going to get it, because this is not considered in what in this country is called qua lit.

32:49.917 --> 32:53.264
You know, quality literature, serious literature.

32:54.146 --> 32:58.454
I think there's a lot about the world we live in today, but it won't be considered seriously.

32:58.474 --> 32:59.937
It'll be considered a popular novel.

33:04.286 --> 33:08.314
But there is a difference between the mystery and the straight novel.

33:09.982 --> 33:13.065
Where were we going?

33:13.145 --> 33:20.231
I really would like to talk about that, you know, because every time you said you teach the amateur something, there's an edge to your voice.

33:20.672 --> 33:24.175
Well, it's disturbing me more and more of late.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.998
And in general, also talk about the profession of writer.

33:27.138 --> 33:32.062
You are the quintessential pro, I think, is certainly my perception of you.

33:32.503 --> 33:32.803
Thank you.

33:32.823 --> 33:33.664
You said it, not me.

33:33.684 --> 33:35.345
I don't like to say it about myself.

33:35.365 --> 33:36.667
It's my lead, isn't it?

33:36.687 --> 33:36.967
Thank you.

33:36.987 --> 33:37.187
Thank you.

33:37.724 --> 33:38.886
Thank you.

33:38.906 --> 33:39.607
That's very kind.

33:39.647 --> 33:43.653
That's the highest accolade anyone should give this.

33:43.673 --> 33:47.519
But anyway, maybe just... That's my phrase.

33:47.639 --> 33:55.811
What troubles me a lot about these Johnny-come-latelyers is that they spring from the earth.

33:55.851 --> 33:58.855
They haven't had any real training.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.242
They haven't paid their dues.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.837
Well, before I wrote The Black Boar Jungle, I had had about 60 short stories published.

34:08.678 --> 34:13.166
I had had three science fiction novels for young adults published.

34:13.768 --> 34:15.551
I had had two mystery novels published.

34:16.492 --> 34:18.035
And then came The Black Boar Jungle.

34:18.055 --> 34:19.257
You know, I had worked at it.

34:19.438 --> 34:27.913
And in college, I had taken every writing course they offered, from poetry to playwriting to short stories to essays, whatever they offered.

34:28.535 --> 34:30.437
I wrote a column for the school newspaper.

34:30.457 --> 34:31.698
I wanted to be a writer.

34:32.559 --> 34:35.022
This was my solid background for it.

34:35.882 --> 34:37.824
These guys, they spring out of the earth.

34:38.986 --> 34:40.047
They write badly.

34:40.848 --> 34:45.392
They suddenly get a book that leaps into number one on the bestseller list.

34:46.073 --> 34:49.556
With their inflated egos, they write another book.

34:50.337 --> 34:55.082
They're intoxicated with the scent of their own perfumes.

34:55.501 --> 35:02.236
And the other book becomes a bestseller, and the next thing you know, they think of themselves as writers.

35:02.256 --> 35:03.819
And I don't think of themselves as writers.

35:03.839 --> 35:05.763
I think of them as lucky amateurs.

35:05.783 --> 35:06.565
Sure.

35:06.585 --> 35:13.600
Well, you look at it, and I'm not asking you to comment and say it to Tom Clancy, for instance, but I don't think you've read any of his books.

35:13.620 --> 35:14.843
Never.

35:15.616 --> 35:22.746
I think it's a case where he probably represents 10 or 15 or 20 percent of the gross of Putnam's, and they're afraid to edit him.

35:22.886 --> 35:25.650
But, I mean, you can't touch his copy, is what I hear.

35:25.690 --> 35:26.231
I don't know.

35:26.251 --> 35:32.860
1,300-page books, you know, that could probably be told nearly 400 pages, you know.

35:35.103 --> 35:36.766
But his ego takes over.

35:36.866 --> 35:37.607
I read this book.

35:38.684 --> 35:41.788
Now we're back home.

35:42.709 --> 35:44.110
Now we're back home.

35:44.130 --> 35:46.313
Can we just finish with the amateur thing?

35:46.433 --> 35:46.994
Sure.

35:47.394 --> 35:55.284
So it just, it irks me.

35:55.884 --> 36:04.995
I feel people should, you know, I wouldn't let a guy come in off the street and take out my appendix.

36:06.308 --> 36:10.114
without having gone to medical school and knowing there was something about surgery.

36:10.154 --> 36:15.482
And it seems to me some guy shouldn't come out of the street and write a novel without any background.

36:16.323 --> 36:25.076
Well, everybody certainly has the right to try, whether or not it should be acclaimed as the greatest thing since the day of the jackpot.

36:25.156 --> 36:26.959
You know, I think we're sending a message.

36:27.740 --> 36:34.290
I think we're sending the jackpot message to America that anybody can sit down with no training or anything and write a book,

36:35.317 --> 36:36.679
And it can be illiterate.

36:36.699 --> 36:40.025
It can be the worst prose that you've ever read in your life.

36:40.927 --> 36:48.139
And you can hit the big million-dollar, multi-million-dollar jackpot, and it'll be a movie, and number one on the bestseller list, and all that.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.283
And that's a wrong message, essentially.

36:50.303 --> 36:52.066
It's against the work ethic, to me.

36:52.086 --> 36:53.228
To me, it drives me nuts.

36:53.328 --> 36:57.375
One of the reasons my book was canceled at Random House is because they had so little money.

36:57.811 --> 37:02.725
tied up with me, and they had tons, millions upon millions, tied up with the plot.

37:02.745 --> 37:05.594
You know, they have, I mean, for other writers.

37:05.714 --> 37:09.525
Yeah, I mean, for writers who have spent five or six years on public,

37:09.961 --> 37:11.022
who deserve a shot.

37:11.743 --> 37:15.186
All of a sudden, they're losing their ass on guns.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.528
They've got to cut it someplace else.

37:17.709 --> 37:23.955
Not only is it not right for the message it sends out, it's not right for the other serious writers who are working.

37:24.335 --> 37:32.583
Well, you see, the publisher will say, yeah, but when we make money on these blockbusters, then this allows us to print poetry and serious fiction.

37:32.603 --> 37:34.585
Number one, they don't print poetry anymore.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.808
Number two, the November 1st novel that you see was

37:37.940 --> 37:39.382
Yeah, but we have time.

37:39.402 --> 37:39.582
Okay.

37:39.622 --> 37:40.664
Well, we've got ten minutes.

37:40.684 --> 37:40.964
Okay.

37:41.405 --> 37:43.368
Let's tell you a little, you know, a quote.

37:43.388 --> 37:44.690
I've got the quotes elsewhere.

37:44.750 --> 37:51.941
I mean, like Bob Parker Spencer does age at about three-quarter speed, you know, in real life.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.985
But your 87th Precinct stuff is really fixed.

37:55.626 --> 37:56.647
They're all 30-something.

37:56.888 --> 37:57.188
Yeah.

37:57.268 --> 37:58.370
They're still all 30-something.

37:58.771 --> 38:01.234
Haven't you ever thought about bringing them along with you a little bit?

38:01.394 --> 38:03.137
No, because then they'd be dung.

38:03.370 --> 38:04.571
Daughtering old fools.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.755
Investigating crimes.

38:07.775 --> 38:10.719
They'll be coming in on walkers.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.581
Lieutenant Burns will be in a wheelchair.

38:12.621 --> 38:14.564
What's going on, Steve?

38:15.064 --> 38:17.147
But the readers don't complain about this.

38:17.267 --> 38:18.128
They accept it.

38:18.228 --> 38:19.630
Some of them get confused by it.

38:19.790 --> 38:20.992
I get a letter every now and then.

38:21.152 --> 38:26.539
How come the twins were born and they're still only 10 years old?

38:26.719 --> 38:27.940
I sent them a chapter from it.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.363
A guy wrote a book about the 85th Precinct.

38:30.383 --> 38:33.327
And I sent them his chapter from...

38:34.235 --> 38:38.941
The elastic calendar and the perpetual clock or something like that.

38:38.961 --> 38:40.283
And I just send them that chapter.

38:40.803 --> 38:42.626
So here, read this and we'll explain the whole work.

38:42.646 --> 38:43.567
That's great.

38:43.587 --> 38:44.828
That's great.

38:44.848 --> 38:47.612
Are you happy to be back with Levin Hunter again?

38:47.652 --> 38:47.912
Yeah.

38:48.834 --> 38:50.816
So are we going to wait another ten years for the next one?

38:50.836 --> 38:50.976
No, no.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.159
I've been working on another one anyway.

38:54.481 --> 38:56.123
That's a very ambitious book.

38:56.363 --> 38:58.446
And I hope I get it right.

38:58.486 --> 39:00.208
I haven't got it right yet, but I will.

39:00.323 --> 39:06.375
It starts in ancient Sumeria, and it comes up to today, through the ages.

39:06.435 --> 39:14.231
So it's a big, fat book, and it'll probably be... I think it's the best thing I've ever done, if I ever get it right.

39:14.251 --> 39:15.333
I haven't got it right yet.

39:15.353 --> 39:15.934
I'll get it right.

39:16.295 --> 39:22.247
Does it bother you that writers of mystery... Of course, it's changing, but are...

39:23.645 --> 39:29.492
in some cases dismissed by the literati as genre writers.

39:30.033 --> 39:30.774
It used to bother me.

39:30.794 --> 39:32.255
It doesn't any longer.

39:32.596 --> 39:37.702
There are about ten old men in Sweden deciding on who gets the Nobel Prize.

39:37.722 --> 39:43.068
And even then it's very political.

39:43.088 --> 39:44.390
Graham Greene never got it.

39:44.430 --> 39:45.752
But Edna Furbin did.

39:45.772 --> 39:47.233
But Edna Furbin did, yeah.

39:47.253 --> 39:49.416
Sort of Pearl S. Buck.

39:50.425 --> 39:51.728
Remember Pearl Buck?

39:51.748 --> 39:52.089
Sure.

39:52.149 --> 39:52.951
One book.

39:53.111 --> 39:54.374
Yeah, The Good Earth.

39:54.414 --> 39:55.556
Well, Dragon Seed.

39:55.616 --> 39:58.302
Yeah, one book that certainly has stood the test of time.

39:58.322 --> 39:59.204
Yeah, Tony Morrison.

39:59.224 --> 40:02.411
You know, does she deserve to know about that?

40:02.432 --> 40:03.915
Eight, nine books.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.318
Politically correct.

40:05.338 --> 40:06.541
Of course.

40:06.561 --> 40:08.786
Would you kindly be honored on this?

40:08.926 --> 40:09.447
Indeed me.
