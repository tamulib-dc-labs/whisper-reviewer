00:02.292 --> 00:06.296
This is, they call it now, Budget Host Motel.

00:06.796 --> 00:07.977
This was Rosner's Motel.

00:07.997 --> 00:09.639
When I first moved down here after I left St.

00:09.699 --> 00:15.284
Louis in 1968, I decided when I quit collecting fauna that I also had to change my life.

00:15.764 --> 00:17.085
I didn't want to be an academician.

00:17.145 --> 00:18.807
I didn't go into academics.

00:18.827 --> 00:20.508
I was going to be a teacher, and I veered away.

00:21.109 --> 00:23.531
I knew I wanted to be a writer by that time, severely.

00:23.871 --> 00:30.257
And I knew if I were going to be a writer, I had to educate myself in a different way than I had been educated for seven years of college.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.006
I, by that time, had two master's degrees, one in English, one in creative writing.

00:35.026 --> 00:37.330
And I had a BA from Yale, and I'd had enough education.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.174
So I came down to Farmington, Missouri, and put myself in a factory.

00:40.895 --> 00:44.501
And I ran a factory for 15 years where we sewed them.

00:44.521 --> 00:45.903
A mineral area college.

00:45.943 --> 00:48.266
And I taught at that little college, that junior college.

00:48.286 --> 00:48.927
A mineral area?

00:48.947 --> 00:50.169
A mineral area junior college.

00:50.309 --> 00:56.018
I taught creative writing and short fiction there to give back something to the community.

00:56.338 --> 00:59.383
The cost to get in my classes was $18 a semester.

01:01.456 --> 01:03.238
That school does more for this community.

01:03.258 --> 01:06.141
They would have no higher education otherwise.

01:06.161 --> 01:07.703
People would have none.

01:07.723 --> 01:09.685
Most people don't go to college from here.

01:09.705 --> 01:10.926
So I came down to this area.

01:10.966 --> 01:16.772
I stayed in that motel, Rosner's Motel, for six months until I finally found a home down here in Farmington.

01:16.792 --> 01:21.197
And it was in Farmington in 1968 when I came down here that I went into the factory.

01:21.497 --> 01:25.661
I had to unlearn after the bees.

01:25.681 --> 01:27.583
And what I did, I wanted to change my life.

01:27.603 --> 01:31.227
I wanted to learn what normal people are all about, people who have to work for a living.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.153
so to speak.

01:32.173 --> 01:35.656
People go to work with a brown bag for lunch.

01:35.736 --> 01:44.665
I'm suggesting that the kinds of people who ultimately wouldn't take my collection into the universities were the same arrogant people who had been teaching me for years.

01:45.145 --> 01:55.154
And those arrogant people believe that the ivory tower is what makes America's economy work and America's whole social existence function.

01:55.254 --> 01:57.957
And quite frankly, it is the narrowest of worlds.

01:58.713 --> 02:03.981
And it is inbred, it's incestuous, and I still have a real hang-up about it.

02:04.001 --> 02:08.328
Now, paradoxically, I've written nine scholarly books.

02:08.348 --> 02:11.934
Because that's another part of the challenge in me, and we'll get to that, too.

02:11.954 --> 02:14.318
Let's go back to the way this ended on the other side.

02:15.359 --> 02:17.443
They got the collection, they made me curator.

02:17.483 --> 02:18.364
That's the last thing we did.

02:18.384 --> 02:21.749
They made me curator, for which they pay me a salary for 20 years.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.352
We tried to create it.

02:23.412 --> 02:23.953
It started in 88?

02:24.474 --> 02:24.754
Yes.

02:24.953 --> 02:28.477
We tried to create an innovative way by which they could acquire the collection.

02:28.578 --> 02:30.680
Did you put a value on it, kind of an arbitrary value on it?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.963
Yes, the value had been put on it that wasn't arbitrary.

02:32.983 --> 02:39.431
We brought in Ralph Zipper, a very fine California book dealer, his associate, Ralph Moskowitz.

02:39.551 --> 02:41.113
Larry Moskowitz.

02:41.133 --> 02:45.319
The two of them spent three days here on the tab of the university.

02:45.479 --> 02:50.385
Southeast Missouri State paid them a considerable sum to do an official appraisal.

02:50.405 --> 02:52.027
The appraisal came out at $3,600,000.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.370
That was very low.

02:54.653 --> 02:55.574
And that was fine.

02:56.215 --> 03:00.801
The collection is probably worth $10 million in today's market.

03:00.861 --> 03:06.229
You think if you were to consign this to South Visa Christie's, God forbid, but... I wouldn't have brought $3 million, no.

03:06.389 --> 03:07.551
It would have done better than that.

03:07.571 --> 03:08.532
It would have done worse than that.

03:08.552 --> 03:10.254
It would have done about $2 million.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.058
No, I just think that the collection has that value now.

03:13.078 --> 03:15.081
No, because the book market is a small market.

03:15.141 --> 03:16.162
It would have grunted the market.

03:16.763 --> 03:20.408
We haven't even been able to sell off all of Carl Peterson's collection, and it wasn't very good.

03:20.962 --> 03:22.444
It was quantitative in bulk.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.529
The best piece is sold and all the rest of it's going to sit around.

03:26.431 --> 03:29.356
No, I think it would have brought about $2 million.

03:29.436 --> 03:31.359
But it was valued at $3.6 million.

03:31.379 --> 03:35.205
So the university came up with all kinds of innovative ways by which they could acquire it.

03:35.486 --> 03:39.833
I gave a lot of it, but they still had to acquire some of it.

03:39.853 --> 03:46.243
And they did it in part by making me a curator and making me a salaried member of the university for 20 years.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.704
So that was part of it.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.506
It wasn't just an out-and-out donation.

03:50.587 --> 03:52.129
And was there a cash?

03:52.690 --> 03:55.635
Yes, there was a cash remuneration for it.

03:55.695 --> 04:02.225
My father, who has also put in money to the collection over the years, he gave away a portion of it.

04:02.285 --> 04:05.430
He and I both gave away the equivalent.

04:08.279 --> 04:10.762
of about two and a half million dollars worth of the collection.

04:11.383 --> 04:11.603
Oh, really?

04:11.683 --> 04:12.864
Now you say your father put mine.

04:12.884 --> 04:13.825
I didn't know this.

04:14.426 --> 04:19.091
Well, I can only tell you that he helped fund it as I built it over the years.

04:19.111 --> 04:20.433
What was his attitude to it?

04:20.593 --> 04:21.654
He wasn't helping.

04:21.674 --> 04:24.718
It was real grudging and reluctant.

04:24.738 --> 04:28.602
I mean, did he think that we're indulging the obsession of my son?

04:28.722 --> 04:29.123
Oh, yeah.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.144
And he really got angry.

04:30.164 --> 04:31.025
Are you an only child?

04:31.185 --> 04:31.646
No, I'm not.

04:31.666 --> 04:32.407
They're four other children.

04:32.427 --> 04:34.489
But he got very angry with that, and yet he wouldn't.

04:34.823 --> 04:35.544
He would do that.

04:36.045 --> 04:38.349
Where are you in the... I'm the oldest.

04:38.469 --> 04:40.713
You're the oldest.

04:41.154 --> 04:46.543
I could at times persuade him to abet my passion.

04:46.563 --> 04:51.252
Well, for instance, would you go to him and say, look, Dad, I need help on this?

04:51.272 --> 04:55.479
Yeah, I would do that, and sometimes I'd really have to beg, and sometimes it was a little easier.

04:55.559 --> 04:58.384
But he always did it reluctantly because he really didn't believe in it.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.412
He just didn't believe in it at all.

05:00.492 --> 05:02.556
He didn't think Falker was important.

05:02.576 --> 05:04.879
He is a very pragmatic businessman.

05:05.100 --> 05:05.961
Why did he do it then?

05:06.422 --> 05:10.868
I guess he did it because I worked hard enough at tugging at him.

05:10.888 --> 05:13.252
Was he indulging you, do you think?

05:13.272 --> 05:14.814
Oh yeah, I'm sure he was indulging me.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.938
He certainly believed that himself anyway.

05:16.998 --> 05:22.025
I always tried to persuade him that what I was doing to get to his part was a great investment.

05:22.045 --> 05:24.469
Although I myself knew I never did it as an investment.

05:24.589 --> 05:25.671
But I was just about...

05:26.005 --> 05:31.233
to suggest that as a businessman, he thought, well... He thought it was a weak investment.

05:31.473 --> 05:34.217
We're not going to... He thought it was a non-existent investment.

05:34.278 --> 05:36.681
In other words, he probably thought he would lose money on it.

05:36.721 --> 05:37.162
Of course.

05:37.262 --> 05:49.320
He thought it was perfectly wrong because to him, a significant investment is one that is in stocks or one that is in something that yields an immediate negotiable amount of money.

05:49.661 --> 05:52.485
For the record, can you tell me what your father's business...

05:52.853 --> 05:55.595
Yes, he was a manufacturer of men's clothing.

05:55.635 --> 06:01.200
The factory that I'll show you down here in Farmington real briefly was the company that I worked for.

06:01.541 --> 06:02.522
The company is built well.

06:02.622 --> 06:06.425
It ultimately was sold to Interco, which is a large conglomerate in St.

06:06.465 --> 06:07.226
Louis International.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.767
It's a very well-known product.

06:08.807 --> 06:09.207
Wonderful.

06:09.228 --> 06:10.909
We make John Alexander slacks.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.433
We make Benchley and Taylor's Bench were some of our brands.

06:15.593 --> 06:16.274
Wonderful things.

06:16.294 --> 06:16.854
Rough Rider.

06:17.315 --> 06:18.135
Our company is wonderful.

06:18.175 --> 06:22.219
My dad started it in 1929 in the year of the Depression.

06:22.621 --> 06:24.128
It now is owned by Hart & Marks.

06:24.269 --> 06:25.354
Hart & Marks.

06:25.374 --> 06:25.776
Really?

06:25.796 --> 06:29.172
And it is a wonderful clothing company in this country.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.153
and it's one of the few that survived.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.375
The name of the company was?

06:33.616 --> 06:34.096
Biltwell.

06:34.136 --> 06:35.878
B-I-L-T-W-E-L-L.

06:36.058 --> 06:37.919
I worked for Biltwell for 18 years.

06:37.979 --> 06:39.120
I wanted to work with my father.

06:39.561 --> 06:40.702
Did your father expect me?

06:40.742 --> 06:43.304
And yet I didn't want to work near him because he was too demanding.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.145
He was overbearing.

06:44.165 --> 06:47.267
Do you think maybe that your father really wanted you to come into the business?

06:47.307 --> 06:48.208
Yes, I think he did.

06:48.268 --> 06:54.954
Maybe this was one way to placate you by indulging this obsession?

06:55.314 --> 06:56.275
No, not at all.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.517
But I think he did want me to come into the business.

06:58.497 --> 07:02.621
And I think that he always felt that I have been indulgent and irresponsible.

07:02.641 --> 07:05.624
And it's always been a real source of discomfort for me.

07:06.184 --> 07:07.786
And it's created a great deal of tension.

07:08.567 --> 07:11.970
And I've always been a person who has acted upon his own beliefs.

07:12.531 --> 07:15.033
And I've worked on my own intuitions.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.776
And so that I always did go against his grain.

07:17.796 --> 07:21.219
And yet he did aid and abet me quite often.

07:23.481 --> 07:25.483
How much better do you think you put into the collection?

07:26.560 --> 07:30.387
I put in, between my father and I, we put in about $600,000.

07:30.747 --> 07:34.253
How much did your father put in, do you think?

07:34.273 --> 07:36.237
I would say that he put in half of that.

07:36.257 --> 07:36.598
Geez.

07:38.441 --> 07:38.962
Over the years.

07:39.182 --> 07:39.382
Wow.

07:39.402 --> 07:41.186
But you know, over the years, that really isn't very much money.

07:41.246 --> 07:45.794
If you divide $600,000 by 30 years, what do you have?

07:46.635 --> 07:46.976
I don't know.

07:46.996 --> 07:49.140
What do you have?

07:49.160 --> 07:49.981
I don't know.

07:50.001 --> 07:51.604
$50,000?

07:51.664 --> 07:51.724
No.

07:51.940 --> 08:21.711
No no whatever. Well you can figure it out when you do your mathematics. But that isn't a whole lot of money over the years. That's not the amount but. What it is is what it is is i did get him to it's a loving father. Well it was a nice father and he did and my mother was behind it. If it hadn't been for my mother my father wouldn't have done it. You see I've asked why did Ather Houghton for instance uh finally sell up and uh I would love to talk to Ather Houghton but he died of course, and some people suggest that everybody in the family thought he was crazy buying this stuff in the first place.

08:22.045 --> 08:25.688
And he says, I'll show the sons of bitches, you know, that this is worth some money.

08:26.309 --> 08:28.471
And maybe he lost interest in it, too.

08:28.611 --> 08:33.076
But he did divest himself of that collection as a fairly young man.

08:33.256 --> 08:38.160
I always wanted to prove to my father that what I had done was not only significant, but responsible.

08:38.661 --> 08:44.567
He always felt that what I had done, my activities were irresponsible, that that was spendthrift, that it was wasteful.

08:45.227 --> 08:46.869
And it always annoyed me.

08:46.889 --> 08:48.971
And to this day, I have a lot of problems with that.

08:49.051 --> 08:50.472
And I don't want you to publish that.

08:50.492 --> 08:50.672
OK.

08:50.732 --> 08:51.293
Well, what?

08:51.610 --> 08:52.551
Oh, that notion.

08:53.852 --> 08:55.674
Let's be specific about what you don't want me to use.

08:57.156 --> 08:59.678
I don't want you to use that I have a lot of problems with that.

09:00.419 --> 09:02.361
I'm going to show you the house that I lived in.

09:02.381 --> 09:04.163
This is very pretty where we are, by the way.

09:04.263 --> 09:06.445
This is 628 West Columbia.

09:06.626 --> 09:07.527
This is where I live.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.308
Boy, I see all the beautiful houses are up for sale now.

09:09.369 --> 09:10.129
It's real sad.

09:10.590 --> 09:13.072
They put a state prison down at the end of the street.

09:13.092 --> 09:14.033
That blew it away, man.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.517
But here's where I raised my little family in this beautiful Victorian home.

09:17.868 --> 09:19.330
This is the heartland of America.

09:19.450 --> 09:23.314
It is, and I've got a book about Farmington called 628 West Columbia.

09:23.634 --> 09:24.595
That's the beauty.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.477
This is 628 West Columbia?

09:26.497 --> 09:26.597
Yeah.

09:27.298 --> 09:28.279
Is this still in the family?

09:28.439 --> 09:30.702
No, I sold it about four years ago now.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.023
Three years ago.

09:32.083 --> 09:32.924
I hated doing that.

09:33.344 --> 09:34.125
My wife and I hated it.

09:34.165 --> 09:34.365
Beautiful.

09:34.445 --> 09:35.326
Boy, that's gorgeous.

09:35.627 --> 09:36.568
We loved living here.

09:36.648 --> 09:37.969
Just let me shut this up for a second.

09:37.989 --> 09:38.950
It was real pastoral.

09:40.392 --> 09:43.555
What I warred against, or warred with,

09:44.918 --> 09:47.842
When I was young, when I was at Washington U. W-A-R-R-E-D.

09:49.124 --> 09:50.627
I'm making a verb out of that.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.349
That's my typist.

09:52.369 --> 09:54.893
I've seen it at the factory where I work now that I'm here.

09:55.414 --> 09:59.460
The problem I had as a young man was I had to pull, twin pulls.

09:59.660 --> 10:04.848
One was that on the one hand, my dad had sent me to Yale, and I began becoming a sensitive young man.

10:05.869 --> 10:11.017
I began to become sensitive to aesthetics, to literature, to the humanities.

10:11.037 --> 10:13.761
And here this man who had never gone to college,

10:14.180 --> 10:26.837
who had become a multi-millionaire as a businessman, who was really brilliant as a businessman, had sent his son, and to his consternation, when I arrived back home, discovered that the young boy he'd sent away to college really didn't have an interest in that business at all.

10:27.358 --> 10:31.824
And this is the factory where I worked, and I worked alongside up to 300 people who worked in there.

10:33.106 --> 10:37.652
And I was the assistant manager, and then I branched out, and I created a whole business out of that of Slack Outlets.

10:38.152 --> 10:40.896
I created my own multi-million dollar business from nothing out of there.

10:41.602 --> 10:46.268
I ended up with seven outlet stores at one time before factory outlets were even in vogue.

10:46.288 --> 10:47.971
I created the concept almost.

10:48.652 --> 10:55.561
There were a few, but I virtually created the concept, along with other people at that time, of the factory outlet store.

10:55.581 --> 10:59.927
And I won't tell you about that story now, but it's a real interesting story about me and my dad.

10:59.947 --> 11:00.989
What were the names of the stores?

11:01.109 --> 11:02.290
We call it the Slack Outlet.

11:03.011 --> 11:09.280
And it had branches in all the little heartland towns where we didn't do business, where Biltwell didn't have mainline businesses.

11:09.817 --> 11:12.449
And believe it or not, I had created a multi-million dollar business.

11:12.529 --> 11:15.302
This is a little town that was real comfortable for me.

11:16.366 --> 11:17.411
I'll show you my little office.

11:17.431 --> 11:19.219
I had a writing office downtown here.

11:20.043 --> 11:29.938
I loved going in the cafe and writing poems about all the townsfolk and all the... Yeah, and that's where my office was, up there, where the railing is, where the stretch doors are.

11:30.178 --> 11:32.962
Oh, and the glass window.

11:33.083 --> 11:38.170
$80 a month for three big rooms up there.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.092
It was wonderful.

11:39.372 --> 11:41.014
The building was from the 1890s.

11:42.196 --> 11:45.481
And I was real comfortable living in this town, and as an artist, it helped me.

11:45.501 --> 11:46.623
But let me tell you what happened, Nick.

11:46.643 --> 11:48.025
It was real interesting to me.

11:48.612 --> 11:55.522
I was, as a young man, when I came back from Yale, I had all these notions, these literary notions.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.824
I came back with a book collection.

11:56.864 --> 11:58.166
I was imbued with literature.

11:58.386 --> 12:00.109
Yale had done a wonderful number on me.

12:00.549 --> 12:02.091
I was imbued with American studies.

12:03.053 --> 12:04.134
I loved Americana.

12:05.096 --> 12:08.120
So I came back, and I went into Washington U, as I told you.

12:08.140 --> 12:13.408
And I started in the business school for the first semester, and I guess my dad was real pleased about that, only I found it towards me.

12:13.428 --> 12:17.674
So after a semester, I went over to the English school, and I enrolled, and I stayed there for three years.

12:18.093 --> 12:20.195
And I took a master's in English, and I began writing.

12:21.016 --> 12:23.378
And I wrote prose, lots of prose then, and a little poetry.

12:25.239 --> 12:28.562
And then I went up to San Francisco State, and I took a creative writing degree.

12:28.582 --> 12:40.232
But what happened at Washington U that changed my whole world was after I wrote my master's thesis on William Faulkner on three of the novels, and I intended to expand it into a PhD dissertation into 10 chapters.

12:40.332 --> 12:42.854
I wrote three chapters in the books down there in the collection now.

12:43.795 --> 12:47.138
The people at Washington U said, oh, Mr. Brodsky, this is obvious.

12:47.405 --> 12:57.139
It's obvious from your thesis that you know you're Faulkner, and they gave me a three-hour exam, but don't bother to apply here for your PhD because you haven't followed the rules.

12:57.159 --> 12:58.521
You haven't given us any footnotes.

12:58.541 --> 12:59.763
You haven't followed style.

12:59.823 --> 13:01.486
I said, yes, this is a very fine thesis.

13:01.526 --> 13:02.106
It was original.

13:02.587 --> 13:05.111
I'd read everything you could read on Faulkner criticism at the time.

13:05.732 --> 13:06.293
Everything.

13:07.574 --> 13:10.659
But I hadn't footnoted anything because I hadn't used it.

13:10.779 --> 13:13.463
I created my own thesis.

13:14.084 --> 13:14.925
And it was innovative.

13:15.045 --> 13:18.510
And why that happened was I later knew I was an artist.

13:19.311 --> 13:20.533
I didn't want to repeat.

13:21.154 --> 13:22.236
I wanted to make something new.

13:22.256 --> 13:26.662
The book you read of mine, William Faulkner Life Glimpses, I promise you was all new.

13:26.682 --> 13:32.791
And most of the quotations in there or the references in there are to prime material or to my own work.

13:33.892 --> 13:35.274
They said, don't bother to apply here.

13:35.294 --> 13:37.958
It was so shocking and so traumatic to me.

13:38.219 --> 13:39.260
I thought, well, fuck them.

13:39.681 --> 13:40.582
This is academia.

13:40.682 --> 13:41.323
I don't need it.

13:41.590 --> 13:47.820
And it was the greatest thing that happened to me, because then I went out to San Francisco State, and I studied for a year, and I knew it was a writer I was going to be.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.501
So I went down.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.562
I left San Francisco.

13:49.883 --> 13:54.510
I got my first job at Miami in Coconut Grove at a junior college.

13:54.530 --> 13:55.191
I went down there.

13:55.211 --> 14:00.740
I stayed three days for the introductory material, and I said, oh, God, this isn't for me.

14:00.760 --> 14:01.461
So I called my dad.

14:01.501 --> 14:05.767
I said, Dad, you just bought a new factory in southeast Missouri in Farmington.

14:05.787 --> 14:06.569
Could I go down there?

14:06.609 --> 14:07.330
Could I work there?

14:08.031 --> 14:08.712
He said, what?

14:09.468 --> 14:10.649
I said, yeah, I'd like to.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.311
And I'm sure he said, yeah, that's fine.

14:12.812 --> 14:16.496
And I knew that pleased him because then he thought, ah, my son's finally coming back to this business.

14:17.678 --> 14:21.342
What I really had in mind was I wanted to get away from academia.

14:21.783 --> 14:22.804
I wanted to be a writer.

14:22.844 --> 14:29.392
And I knew I wasn't going to write well writing the kinds of things I was writing because they were too academic.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.135
They were like the poetry of Anthony Hecht.

14:32.155 --> 14:34.117
They were like the poetry of Don Finkel.

14:34.137 --> 14:37.922
They were like all the academic poetry that James Merrill

14:38.189 --> 14:45.158
It was so abstruse and it was so academic that it had no heart in it.

14:45.178 --> 14:45.939
I didn't know enough.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.264
And I don't believe those people know enough about life either.

14:49.284 --> 14:51.126
I think the stuff is so interned and narrow.

14:51.948 --> 14:52.568
Even Nemirov.

14:52.769 --> 14:55.933
Nemirov has spent all his life virtually in academia.

14:55.953 --> 14:57.475
He's out here, isn't he?

14:57.495 --> 14:59.918
He's been at Washington U. He's just retiring.

14:59.938 --> 15:01.260
I don't think people like that...

15:01.814 --> 15:05.418
can give us responsible art, finally.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.441
I think we're going to be responsible.

15:09.702 --> 15:23.636
I think to be responsible, you have to have lived enough life and have had enough experience so that the wisdom that you attempt to incorporate in your art has some meaning for other people.

15:23.896 --> 15:28.041
Now, how was I going to write writing that the common man could understand?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.403
A lot of people can read Robert Frost,

15:30.907 --> 15:32.069
And yet he's deep.

15:32.089 --> 15:33.811
He can be deep.

15:33.831 --> 15:43.924
I wanted to write the kind of writing that people could read and at the same time could have some humanity to it.

15:44.505 --> 15:45.886
So I put myself in this factory.

15:46.447 --> 15:54.838
And at the time I put myself in the factory, I also quit collecting Faulkner because that was part of that whole need of mine to get away from academia.

15:55.645 --> 15:56.726
So I began to live life.

15:57.107 --> 15:59.569
I would visit the factory hands homes.

15:59.589 --> 16:00.090
I'd have dinner.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.051
They'd invite me over.

16:01.732 --> 16:03.053
I would go to their weddings.

16:03.834 --> 16:04.515
Things like that.

16:04.875 --> 16:05.796
The factory hands.

16:06.817 --> 16:08.639
That's almost the southern phrase, isn't it?

16:08.659 --> 16:09.260
I guess it is.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.603
I told you we're more southern here than you'd ever imagined.

16:12.623 --> 16:13.765
Let me tell you what else I mean.

16:13.785 --> 16:14.806
I've not heard that expression.

16:15.106 --> 16:18.109
I'm from a mill town in Lowell, Massachusetts.

16:18.810 --> 16:19.611
I moved here.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.866
In 68, and it wasn't until 76 that I drove down to Oxford, or 75, really.

16:24.886 --> 16:26.829
I drove down to 75 with my wife, Jan.

16:28.391 --> 16:33.098
I had no idea how close we were to Faulkner's mythical south.

16:33.118 --> 16:40.608
But if you drove out of here, and I did it many times, from Farmington to Oxford is 333 miles, just as we're driving right now.

16:41.369 --> 16:44.113
You drive across here to 55, down 55.

16:44.262 --> 16:47.327
to 32 and then on into Oxford.

16:47.347 --> 16:49.751
333 miles from here, about seven hours.

16:50.211 --> 16:51.032
That's close.

16:51.053 --> 16:51.714
Close.

16:53.056 --> 16:57.242
I must have done it 100 times over the last, since 76.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.626
He's the main man for you, though.

16:59.646 --> 17:00.507
He was the main man.

17:01.308 --> 17:04.874
He still is the one I most admire as a fictionist.

17:04.994 --> 17:05.815
I take that back.

17:05.956 --> 17:08.680
I also admire just about on the same level Franz Kafka.

17:09.942 --> 17:12.666
The ones I most admire are John Milton.

17:13.507 --> 17:16.550
William Wordsworth, and Walt Whitman.

17:16.570 --> 17:21.435
These are, to me, the three absolutely quintessential poets that have had an effect on me.

17:21.455 --> 17:27.241
Many, many people have had an effect on my writing, and yet my writing has my voice in it.

17:27.361 --> 17:30.524
Faulkner does not come through in my writing.

17:30.664 --> 17:31.965
My syntax is my own.

17:32.005 --> 17:34.107
It's not Faulknerian.

17:34.167 --> 17:41.154
My eloquence, my poetry does derive from Faulkner to this extent that people have asked me, well, what influence did Faulkner have on you?

17:41.174 --> 17:41.995
I already told you.

17:42.582 --> 17:44.604
He influenced me negatively with the novels.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.707
So I quit writing them and I never published them.

17:47.727 --> 17:48.368
Negatively?

17:48.788 --> 17:50.330
In terms of being derivative.

17:50.350 --> 17:51.531
That you couldn't do it.

17:51.551 --> 17:53.573
I could only write Faulknerian clothes.

17:53.593 --> 17:53.773
Yeah.

17:54.274 --> 17:58.798
But Faulkner at his best... Well, you could only attempt Faulknerian clothes.

17:58.819 --> 17:59.779
Attempt it, is right.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.301
And even it came out awkward, of course.

18:02.062 --> 18:08.168
But even if it had been good, any unique, authentic artist knows that that is your death knell.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.209
You can't be derivative.

18:10.229 --> 18:12.152
If you sound echoic, you're in trouble.

18:12.172 --> 18:13.273
There's only one Babe Ruth.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.054
Absolutely.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.235
And there's only one Milton.

18:15.716 --> 18:17.278
And there's only one Hemingway.

18:17.759 --> 18:19.261
And all the rest become parodic.

18:19.641 --> 18:20.763
And there's only one Faulkner.

18:20.783 --> 18:24.567
And you can tell right away when someone... P-A-R-O-D-I-C.

18:25.649 --> 18:28.232
William Styron, at his best, was both at his worst.

18:28.312 --> 18:30.595
And it's probably why he'll never be brilliant like Faulkner.

18:30.862 --> 18:32.383
Because that is very fast.

18:32.403 --> 18:33.644
He was also Faulknerian.

18:33.664 --> 18:36.087
I think that's why it takes him 10 or 12 years to write a book.

18:36.607 --> 18:39.690
And I think that's why he fell into this horrible depression.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.431
Well, that depression, too.

18:41.992 --> 18:45.955
Yeah, and to get your most popular book as a little book on depression is kind of a drag.

18:45.975 --> 18:46.676
That's amazing, isn't it?

18:46.696 --> 18:47.357
Yeah, it's poor.

18:48.077 --> 18:48.518
Real poor.

18:48.538 --> 18:54.763
But, okay, to come back to all that, that's all by way of telling you that I did have a real pull in growing up.

18:55.264 --> 18:59.147
My dad set a wonderful example of being a very pragmatic

19:00.545 --> 19:27.396
businessman, very frugal, very hard working, worked 14 hours a day, a workaholic. I grew up under his aura within his aura and so I was programmed without knowing it to be myself a kind of a workaholic but I was not programmed to be a money-making machine and my dad has been a money-making machine. I got too much aesthetics

19:27.916 --> 19:29.518
somehow imbued in me.

19:29.819 --> 19:30.760
It started at Yale.

19:31.802 --> 19:33.264
It probably started at Country Day.

19:33.304 --> 19:36.910
I had a wonderful education, and a lot of it was humanities-oriented.

19:36.970 --> 19:41.737
You're not a money-making machine, but... I do, but I choose not to push it.

19:41.797 --> 19:49.148
But we should also keep in mind the fact that you are blessed with being

19:50.377 --> 19:51.519
Solve it.

19:51.899 --> 19:52.841
Versatile.

19:52.861 --> 19:55.064
I've made myself versatile.

19:55.164 --> 19:58.609
I wasn't an academic because I didn't choose to be.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.894
And I wasn't a pure businessman because I didn't choose to be.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.578
I am a difficult hybrid.

20:04.598 --> 20:08.183
But I mean, there is some family wealth involved too, isn't there?

20:08.724 --> 20:10.687
No, there isn't much family wealth involved.

20:10.707 --> 20:11.889
No, there's not.

20:12.209 --> 20:13.371
Most of that won't come to me.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.474
Matter of fact, I doubt any of it will come to me.

20:16.195 --> 20:17.377
I have taken my stand.

20:18.178 --> 20:20.181
And my stand is that I'm an individual.

20:20.465 --> 20:26.374
And I really don't want to get into all that.

20:26.734 --> 20:28.838
Don't mind me for asking.

20:28.858 --> 20:29.338
That's fine.

20:29.358 --> 20:33.585
But how it relates to the collecting was that it also created... I'm a very hybrid and unique.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.628
I'm an unorthodox character.

20:35.688 --> 20:36.810
Let's put it that way.

20:36.830 --> 20:40.375
So that even if I were going to collect books, it wasn't going to be done orthodoxly.

20:40.896 --> 20:42.799
I wasn't going to buy out a book dealer's catalog.

20:42.819 --> 20:47.325
I wasn't going to go schmutz around in book dealer's shops because that bores the shit out of me.

20:47.686 --> 20:48.447
It always did.

20:48.663 --> 20:57.576
And the only reason that question, by the way, to go back, the only reason why it's relevant is because there are those who could suggest that L.D.

20:57.636 --> 21:01.161
is able to put this collection together because he comes from a very wealthy family.

21:01.201 --> 21:05.306
And I'm going to now try to redress that.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.870
I'm going to suggest that over all those years,

21:08.423 --> 21:14.726
$600,000 is not a lot of money to build a $10 million collection.

21:14.787 --> 21:15.851
I think that's spectacular.

21:15.871 --> 21:17.557
And most of it was put together.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.986
A lot of it was done through trading.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.726
that I did with other people.

21:21.746 --> 21:26.451
We're going to develop this in the writing, but these are questions that have to be addressed.

21:26.471 --> 21:27.092
I did not.

21:27.192 --> 21:30.835
Let me go on record as stating categorically, and then you can open it up later.

21:30.875 --> 21:36.741
This collection would never have got put together had it been requiring money to do it.

21:36.761 --> 21:37.462
That's great.

21:37.482 --> 21:38.303
I love that.

21:39.164 --> 21:39.744
No way.

21:39.924 --> 21:47.492
It wouldn't even have come close because all the wonderful materials that are in this collection each came from a cluster, a family cluster.

21:47.860 --> 21:58.193
And a family cluster each time that came to me came to me out of respect for me and for what I had done with the collection and for what I was doing with my writing about the collection.

21:58.213 --> 22:07.104
And each time the materials came to me from people who respected the fact that I wasn't going to convert their materials into a capital gains.

22:08.165 --> 22:09.246
Now that's right online.

22:09.326 --> 22:14.012
I don't want to be Freudian, but do you think that maybe you're trying to prove to your father?

22:14.353 --> 22:15.454
Fucking A, yes.

22:15.839 --> 22:16.720
No doubt about it.

22:17.080 --> 22:21.484
I tried to prove to him for so many years that what I was doing wasn't irresponsible.

22:21.885 --> 22:32.555
But until five or six years ago, when he could easily read about Faulkner's reputation in the literary stock market, he would always belabor the fact that what I was doing was irresponsible.

22:33.035 --> 22:34.877
And it really did anguish me.

22:34.897 --> 22:35.958
And it created great tension.

22:36.279 --> 22:38.561
And he did the same thing with my writing.

22:39.141 --> 22:40.903
And so that's been a real source of tension.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.045
And one of the reasons why I was a great collector

22:43.244 --> 22:45.047
is the same reason why I'm a great writer.

22:45.067 --> 22:56.267
I'm driven by an enormous sense of conflicted tension that I'm able to harness and use as productive, creative energy in developing an art that Americans have never had.

22:56.648 --> 23:00.956
My work is so fucking powerful, just like my collecting was powerful.

23:01.457 --> 23:02.979
It's the Babe Ruth of collecting.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.302
And that's not arrogant.

23:04.342 --> 23:07.227
That is the way it is.

23:07.561 --> 23:25.095
I am driven by a massive force, and a lot of that force, Freudianly speaking, may indeed have come from the fact that I am driven now no longer because I realized years ago I was never going to get his approval, which is a casebook kind of a cliché term, but I wanted his approval as a young man.

23:25.355 --> 23:27.680
He once made a comment to me.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.345
He said, I'm sorry I ever sent you to Yale.

23:30.747 --> 23:32.289
I hated hearing that.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.533
It wasn't facetious.

23:35.074 --> 23:38.680
That was early on when I'd come back and he saw that I was tending toward an artist.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.364
Well, that's what happens when you send kids off to liberal arts schools.

23:41.564 --> 23:42.586
Well, that's right.

23:42.666 --> 23:48.435
I mean, I went to Bates College up in Maine, which is just the greatest experience of my life, you know?

23:48.787 --> 23:52.217
Because life has just been a continuation of a liberal arts education for me.

23:52.277 --> 23:52.819
Yes, it has.

23:52.899 --> 23:53.642
I see what you do.

23:53.722 --> 23:54.304
I admire it.

23:54.324 --> 23:55.487
Well, I mean, it's just wonderful.

23:55.507 --> 23:56.911
And isn't it responsible, though?

23:56.931 --> 23:58.717
You've made a livelihood out of it.

23:58.777 --> 24:00.883
Would your dad tell you you're irresponsible?

24:01.425 --> 24:01.726
No.

24:01.746 --> 24:03.150
Well, mine would tell me that.

24:03.890 --> 24:07.495
Well, I resent it.

24:07.936 --> 24:10.279
And a lot of what I work on... Well, is your father still alive?

24:10.299 --> 24:10.860
Yes, he is.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.803
He's 81, and he's still very powerful.

24:12.983 --> 24:13.364
Okay.

24:13.404 --> 24:16.468
And he still works very hard, and he's still very productive.

24:16.528 --> 24:18.631
Okay, but... He still puts in a 12-hour workday.

24:18.751 --> 24:20.874
So he still owns a business, then?

24:20.914 --> 24:23.598
He doesn't own that business, but he has large holdings.

24:23.618 --> 24:24.680
He's a very wealthy man.

24:25.000 --> 24:25.401
Okay.

24:25.421 --> 24:28.345
My... I just throw this out.

24:28.365 --> 24:31.129
Maybe another factor...

24:31.379 --> 24:44.410
not just the arrogance at Yale or at Washington, but also the fact that the Brodsky Collection is here, it may be a validation

24:45.740 --> 24:47.923
That's kind of close to home.

24:47.943 --> 24:50.727
Nothing seemed to validate what I did for him.

24:50.827 --> 24:53.030
Leave that unequivocal.

24:53.050 --> 24:53.310
Really?

24:53.590 --> 24:54.832
And that remains to this day.

24:55.252 --> 24:57.035
And that's a real source of anguishment.

24:57.055 --> 24:59.839
And finally, it's never stopped me from going ahead and doing it.

24:59.859 --> 25:01.541
He always tried to say, no more books.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.083
Don't buy any more books.

25:03.103 --> 25:04.445
I'm not going to loan you any more money.

25:04.485 --> 25:04.905
No more.

25:05.306 --> 25:06.167
You are stupid.

25:06.547 --> 25:07.849
You shouldn't be doing any of that.

25:08.335 --> 25:11.059
You should be saving your money, etc., etc.

25:12.481 --> 25:14.864
This is a great interview, by the way.

25:15.225 --> 25:15.806
We've done a lot.

25:15.866 --> 25:16.867
This is a very good point.

25:16.907 --> 25:21.554
Well, it's all interesting shit, too, Nick, but you're dealing with a character who's, I guess, kind of interesting, finally.

25:21.614 --> 25:22.135
Is that a huck?

25:22.355 --> 25:23.537
Yeah.

25:23.557 --> 25:27.082
And, you know, I say a character because one of the things I do as an artist, I detach from L.D.

25:27.142 --> 25:27.643
Brodsky.

25:27.843 --> 25:29.465
That's why some of the poetry is so powerful.

25:29.485 --> 25:30.607
I'm going to show you some of it.

25:30.627 --> 25:34.492
I write about these weird characters that certainly are composites of me and other people.

25:34.512 --> 25:36.174
This is a beautiful countryside, by the way.

25:36.234 --> 25:36.835
I love it.

25:37.055 --> 25:38.618
Pardon me for just looking around.

25:38.678 --> 25:40.841
I've written more poems about this area right here.

25:41.361 --> 25:45.226
I've got one in Mississippi Vistas where the character is driving from Farmington to St.

25:45.247 --> 25:47.109
Genevieve and then down to Oxford.

25:47.149 --> 25:47.790
Where are we now?

25:47.810 --> 25:48.291
What are we on?

25:48.511 --> 25:51.555
We're on Highway 32.

25:52.042 --> 25:56.147
going from Farmington to Highway 55 that we never should have got off.

25:56.287 --> 25:57.128
Yeah, but this is pretty.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.790
Oh, and in the fall.

25:58.810 --> 25:59.751
I wouldn't miss this.

25:59.771 --> 26:02.814
A week from now, it would really be exciting.

26:02.834 --> 26:03.815
It's just starting to turn.

26:04.256 --> 26:06.398
So what kind of metaphors run through your mind?

26:06.458 --> 26:07.459
What kind of imagery?

26:07.579 --> 26:10.863
I'm going to show you the poems as we drive through here.

26:10.943 --> 26:17.070
Well, unfortunately, I'm talking with you too much, but I've written about the cows and the beautiful turning of the trees.

26:17.050 --> 26:20.194
and the mesentery-like highway that leaves us.

26:20.535 --> 26:26.163
And I would leave, the character would leave early from Farmington and head toward his mecca, Oxford.

26:26.183 --> 26:29.608
And I'll show you Mississippi Vistas, which is a testimony to so many trips there.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.170
Oxford is your mecca.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.191
Well, it has been.

26:32.271 --> 26:33.994
It's not anymore, I think.

26:34.014 --> 26:36.758
In the last five years, I've brought myself to my own mecca.

26:36.778 --> 26:38.981
I mean, you mentioned Milton, Wordsworth, and Whitman.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.484
I mean, so is Camden, New Jersey a mecca?

26:41.745 --> 26:43.047
Is London a mecca?

26:43.067 --> 26:44.989
Only in the book.

26:45.190 --> 26:46.872
Is the Wordsworth country, you know?

26:47.358 --> 26:48.640
Good questions.

26:48.740 --> 26:52.505
And I was able to travel to them just by going to the books.

26:52.846 --> 26:54.548
And now that's all I do with Faulkner.

26:54.568 --> 26:56.671
I haven't been to Oxford in three years.

26:56.751 --> 26:58.113
I had to stop it at some point.

26:58.233 --> 27:00.897
I had to say, enough Faulkner.

27:00.917 --> 27:04.182
Now Brodsky, for the rest of his life, he's going into the final lap.

27:05.143 --> 27:08.728
At about age 47, I said, OK, Brodsky, you've got about 20 years of burn on you.

27:08.988 --> 27:12.673
And now all the writing you've done for 25 years must be harvested.

27:12.693 --> 27:15.998
I created a company, Timeless Press, Poetry and Sight and Sound.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.665
It's now two and a half years old, and we're beginning to make a mark.

27:19.685 --> 27:21.447
It's really class A stuff.

27:22.369 --> 27:28.938
My newest book, Mississippi Vistas, is coming out with an endorsement from Robert Penn Warren Client, Brooks and Malcolm Cowling.

27:30.180 --> 27:33.325
I just had a book endorsed by Elie Wiesel, a book of Holocaust poems.

27:33.766 --> 27:37.992
We're doing very, very beautiful things, and we're getting all kinds of acclaim.

27:39.234 --> 27:43.280
William Stafford, I believe, is going to send us a manuscript now that I'm going to be publishing.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.922
There's a wonderful writer named Antler.

27:45.526 --> 27:47.829
So we're not just publishing LD West?

27:47.949 --> 27:48.670
Not just LD.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.932
We're publishing William Hayen.

27:50.672 --> 27:53.376
We're publishing two other artists, too.

27:53.396 --> 27:57.020
But I've done some real innovative things with Timeless Press, so it's a business sense to me.

27:57.060 --> 28:02.207
Well, was Timeless created to publish the poetry, primarily of Louis Daniel Budd?

28:02.227 --> 28:02.788
Yes, it was.

28:04.710 --> 28:09.576
But there's so much business acumen that I've brought to it that I know full well that the only way that can be done

28:09.927 --> 28:16.235
is by creating an authentic, very important company that can publish other people as well.

28:16.535 --> 28:22.643
And I think you have to understand, too, that the way poetry is marketed today is pure.

28:22.663 --> 28:23.384
It's the pits.

28:23.584 --> 28:25.447
I'm going to show you how to market poetry.

28:25.547 --> 28:26.528
Look at this.

28:27.389 --> 28:32.235
I've got a package here on a wanky road.

28:32.255 --> 28:33.817
Don't worry about it.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.419
Well, I'll show you later.

28:35.479 --> 28:38.483
Keep me off that subject of timeless right now.

28:38.952 --> 28:42.697
Just to come back to the tension, the tension always drove that collection.

28:42.717 --> 28:49.925
At a certain point, I really did get to the point where I wanted to outdo Carl Peters.

28:49.945 --> 28:57.294
In the beginning, I think in the beginning, I just thought, Jesus, if someone could do that, then someone else could do that.

28:57.775 --> 28:59.898
I think that was probably the first impulse.

29:00.078 --> 29:01.279
So let's break it apart.

29:01.299 --> 29:02.561
It probably is worth doing.

29:03.622 --> 29:04.403
I think that...

29:05.125 --> 29:28.579
Not long into that endeavor, after I met Vance, and then after I realized that I could travel all over the country and meet people, and I met tens and tens of people, each of whom had Faulkner artifacts, and each of whom thought he or she had the entire biography of Faulkner in his or her little zeitgeist.

29:28.599 --> 29:31.723
In other words, each of the people I met thought they knew Faulkner.

29:31.940 --> 29:39.631
What it turned out to be was that each one knew a little bit about a very elusive and evasive man, Faulkner.

29:39.651 --> 29:45.600
So where they thought they knew all about him, what was so fascinating to me, I'd go to visit one family or one person.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.805
They'd say, oh yeah, here's how Bill Faulkner was, and this is Bill, and this is the way he was.

29:49.186 --> 29:55.155
I'd go to someone else and they'd say, oh, Bill was this way, and sometimes it would conflict, but sometimes it would just add to the story.

29:55.695 --> 29:56.817
Nobody knew Faulkner.

29:57.168 --> 30:02.477
Faulkner was real private, so each of the people that he knew knew a little piece of him.

30:02.497 --> 30:17.361
I went around piecing together the pieces so that I could not only bring together the artifacts, and that was wonderful, but then I could bring back enough stories to make William Faulkner life glimpses, a biography that, though not large, I'd like to hope is real insightful.

30:18.363 --> 30:20.847
I think I got in touch with Faulkner, the man.

30:21.080 --> 30:28.909
I'd like to think I may have, I'm going to leave this modest, may have better than anybody who has written about falsehoods.

30:28.929 --> 30:43.547
I'd like to hope that that little book stays around and is read by students, because even though it's not massive like Fred Carl's book, and not massive like Blotner's, and even though it is not whatever, it is not what I call a calendared biography.

30:43.567 --> 30:46.010
It is not a womb-to-tomb biography.

30:46.030 --> 30:50.395
It's an innovative biography, because it's the only way an innovative man, writer, is going to write.

30:50.763 --> 30:52.165
And that is innovatively.

30:52.185 --> 30:54.468
So it's a different kind of a biography.

30:54.488 --> 31:09.686
But it is the result of my having made friends with enough people that I went out to talk with, interview, acquire artifacts from, to create what I hope is a real, authentic biography of a man.

31:09.706 --> 31:11.488
So that's what I did in collecting.

31:11.709 --> 31:14.091
I wasn't really collecting books, and I think I told you that.

31:14.111 --> 31:17.155
I didn't consider myself a book collector.

31:17.175 --> 31:18.677
I said I'm a Faulkner collector.

31:19.720 --> 31:28.055
And what I really think I believe, Nick, is that what I've collected has been a bunch of lives.

31:28.075 --> 31:35.248
I intimately collected Vance Boach and his wife Shirley, if you will, through correspondence, through my friendship, through our kindness.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.391
I'll show you the poem.

31:38.791 --> 31:39.592
You'll love the poem.

31:39.612 --> 31:42.916
I've written about the cow in the water hole going over to St.

31:42.956 --> 31:44.577
Jen in my Mississippi Vistas book.

31:44.657 --> 31:46.319
I'll show you that when we get home.

31:46.339 --> 31:50.103
As a matter of fact, I'm going to pick it up this morning.

31:51.345 --> 31:55.409
I'm giving you an awful lot of hot air, more than I've given anyone in years, and I hope I'm not giving you too much.

31:55.429 --> 31:56.770
You can sort out what you do.

31:56.991 --> 32:01.135
We can also make a good chapter in my book from this shit because I'm not going to spew it again to anybody.

32:01.300 --> 32:03.663
If you do these tapes with me, I'd love it.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.867
And then you know what you'll do?

32:05.887 --> 32:08.550
Have you talked about the father stuff to anybody?

32:08.570 --> 32:09.672
No, I haven't.

32:09.792 --> 32:14.599
If you're not on voice in here, what we'll do when we take the interviews, you and I will work on them.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.402
You'll interpolate.

32:16.422 --> 32:17.704
You know what I'm saying?

32:17.724 --> 32:19.086
Because that's how I do it.

32:19.106 --> 32:24.834
I think a few of my... I'm not here to talk, but... Do the chapter with me, though.

32:24.934 --> 32:27.378
In the piece, you'll do a lot of talking.

32:27.398 --> 32:28.439
You'll write it in, you know?

32:28.679 --> 32:29.080
Oh, yeah.

32:29.684 --> 32:32.247
Yeah, it'll be fun.

32:32.447 --> 32:41.196
I've given you a lot of real personal stuff, and I would let you use it if you go over it with me, because it's real tender, and I'm having a bad problem with it right now.

32:41.336 --> 32:42.237
It's terribly tender.

32:42.257 --> 32:43.599
I've had some terrible problems.

32:43.699 --> 32:53.929
I've loved my father, and yet I've grown up with this horrible ambiguity, if you will, or in the wrong word, ambivalence, terrible ambivalences over all these years.

32:53.990 --> 32:59.235
And it's been real tough for me, and it's now become terribly difficult in my personal life.

32:59.418 --> 33:01.061
I hold myself together real well.

33:01.301 --> 33:07.871
I'm very much of a, I think, an extremely unorthodox person.

33:07.891 --> 33:15.303
Not ethically, but just in my sense of wanting to be self-reliant, of wanting to do things creatively and innovatively.

33:15.904 --> 33:17.486
All my poems are innovative.

33:18.187 --> 33:20.811
My lifestyle is innovative.

33:20.831 --> 33:23.075
I don't think I've ever tried to harm anybody.

33:23.115 --> 33:23.856
I've tried to

33:24.190 --> 33:25.712
be caring toward other people.

33:25.732 --> 33:27.033
I'm real giving and caring.

33:27.093 --> 33:29.076
My poetry is all about other people.

33:29.476 --> 33:30.798
I love people.

33:30.818 --> 33:35.743
The reason I gave this collection to Missouri, to the world, it gave the damn thing.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.646
I'm still young enough, I could have kept it for years.

33:38.987 --> 33:39.928
I didn't want it.

33:39.948 --> 33:41.750
It didn't belong to me after a certain point.

33:41.850 --> 33:42.952
It got too good, too big.

33:43.452 --> 33:44.474
It belonged to all of us.

33:45.094 --> 33:48.678
Now, my poetry comes from the same source of motivation.

33:48.698 --> 33:49.219
My art,

33:49.553 --> 33:51.976
is for you and for other people.

33:51.996 --> 33:56.140
And I fully intend for it to get out there for you to at least pass a judgment.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.002
You can then say, I don't want this.

33:58.022 --> 33:58.262
Fine.

33:58.883 --> 34:01.626
I don't think this is good enough or it doesn't move me.

34:01.686 --> 34:01.946
Fine.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.909
But I'm going to put it out there for you to make a judgment.

34:04.929 --> 34:08.473
And I'm working diligently at it just as I did with the Faulkner.

34:08.493 --> 34:09.735
I was driven.

34:09.755 --> 34:16.742
Once I met Broach, Vance Broach, and once I knew what Carl had done, then I began to try to formulate in my own mind

34:17.397 --> 34:19.341
how I wanted to do it myself.

34:19.963 --> 34:30.445
And basically, I parted ways with Carl Peterson, because what I began to understand about Carl and all the other collectors I met was that they really were collecting for themselves.

34:30.897 --> 34:42.012
that it was a selfish indulgence in most cases, and at best it wasn't an indulgence, but that the guiding principle behind most of the collecting I saw going on was, if you will, greed.

34:42.032 --> 34:43.174
Now, I don't want to be too general.

34:43.234 --> 34:44.476
There were exceptions to that.

34:44.996 --> 34:49.102
I have to believe that just about everybody at some level collects for themselves.

34:49.743 --> 34:54.890
I got to the point after the early years where I wasn't collecting for myself.

34:55.611 --> 34:57.293
That's what made this collection great.

34:57.560 --> 35:01.524
It was the point in which... You were looking ahead to the... Well, let me tell you what happened.

35:01.564 --> 35:04.807
In 1978, something great happened.

35:04.827 --> 35:16.558
And that is that a fellow named Robert Hamblin, who taught at Southeast Missouri State University, who had just two years before that, ten years belatedly, received his dissertation from Ole Miss on Faulkner.

35:16.698 --> 35:17.619
What's this stuff growing?

35:17.779 --> 35:18.620
That is Milo.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.043
Yeah, it looks like corn.

35:22.063 --> 35:26.287
It makes sorghum and stuff, and it's fed to cattle anyway.

35:26.307 --> 35:26.487
Go ahead.

35:26.838 --> 35:28.141
It's a real neat-looking plant.

35:28.161 --> 35:31.047
It looks a little like corn, except its top part.

35:32.169 --> 35:33.532
This is gorgeous country.

35:33.592 --> 35:35.977
I'm not going to tell you about it, except I'm going to fill you in.

35:35.997 --> 35:37.219
No, I'm just taking a few notes.

35:37.239 --> 35:38.322
You're getting me to gas here.

35:38.342 --> 35:39.384
I haven't gassed in years.

35:39.484 --> 35:42.089
It must be all coming out today.

35:42.109 --> 35:48.222
The thing is, in 1978, Bob Hamlin called me.

35:48.927 --> 35:53.215
He had been two years away from having received his dissertation ten years after the fact.

35:53.235 --> 35:56.540
He graduated from Ole Miss in 66.

35:57.001 --> 35:58.464
Finished his dissertation in 76.

35:58.564 --> 36:00.087
Had nothing to do.

36:00.107 --> 36:01.629
It was teaching at school.

36:01.649 --> 36:05.556
A kid came down to take a summer class of his who taught in Farmington High School.

36:05.576 --> 36:09.223
He said, oh, I know a man in Farmington who has a wonderful collection of Faulkner.

36:09.243 --> 36:11.406
He'd known me.

36:11.426 --> 36:13.450
Bob Hamlin took note of that and called me.

36:13.818 --> 36:16.280
One night, he said, I teach at the Southeast.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.421
I hear you have a collection.

36:17.862 --> 36:18.642
I love Faulkner.

36:18.662 --> 36:19.543
I did my dissertation.

36:19.563 --> 36:20.464
I'd sure like to meet you.

36:20.844 --> 36:22.646
I said, Mr. Hamlin, come on up.

36:23.487 --> 36:24.628
So one day we met.

36:25.269 --> 36:26.029
I took him to the bank.

36:26.049 --> 36:26.810
I showed him the stuff.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.772
He went crazy.

36:28.792 --> 36:41.023
That, in a glib way, started a relationship, an association, a collaboration that Bob and I have maintained strongly now for going on 12 years.

36:41.594 --> 36:42.997
And it has been just sensational.

36:43.017 --> 36:46.062
We did our first book after that in 1979.

36:46.984 --> 36:50.671
We did an exhibit at Southeast Missouri State, and Virginia published a book from it.

36:50.691 --> 36:54.618
He wrote something in one of your catalogs, I think.

36:54.638 --> 36:55.319
OK, well, let me tell you.

36:55.339 --> 36:56.421
He gave me the third insight.

36:56.902 --> 36:58.144
Peterson gave me the first one.

36:58.946 --> 37:04.716
Vance Broach and Blotner's book gave me the second strong insight.

37:05.101 --> 37:06.623
The third one came from Bob Hamlin.

37:07.284 --> 37:09.387
Bob came up and he said, my God, these beautiful things.

37:09.407 --> 37:10.990
I've only seen modern library editions.

37:11.010 --> 37:12.071
I wrote my whole dissertation.

37:12.091 --> 37:14.795
I've never seen these gorgeous dust jackets or things like this.

37:14.815 --> 37:15.537
These are phenomenal.

37:16.238 --> 37:18.681
He said, what are you going to do with all this?

37:18.721 --> 37:20.484
He said, what are you going to do with all this?

37:21.425 --> 37:26.873
And I thought, hmm, well, Bob, I collected.

37:26.894 --> 37:27.655
That was in 78.

37:29.417 --> 37:31.260
A year after that, he and I went to work.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.012
at what we were going to do with all of it.

37:34.052 --> 37:46.704
So I credit Bob with giving me that third quintessential insight, which was that if you're going to collect at that level, and by that time I've already described, you'll have it in your notes, I'd already gotten some really Class A material.

37:46.724 --> 37:52.689
Well, even before I met him, I got one more set of Class A material, and that was the Phil Stone archive.

37:52.750 --> 37:59.796
I got that right before I met Bob in 78, and right about the time I went up to meet Peterson in Waukegan.

38:01.042 --> 38:05.128
My point, Bob said, what are you going to do with that?

38:05.148 --> 38:06.790
And that put a challenge to me.

38:06.811 --> 38:09.855
Well, Brodsky, what are you going to do with all this stuff now that you've got it?

38:09.875 --> 38:10.476
You're going to hoard it?

38:10.596 --> 38:13.861
You're going to keep it in the best stuff in the bank vaults like Peter's?

38:13.881 --> 38:15.583
You're going to keep the rest of it at your parents' house?

38:15.604 --> 38:16.885
You're going to keep some of it here?

38:16.905 --> 38:17.987
What are you going to do with this stuff?

38:18.862 --> 38:26.471
Brodsky decided he was going to collect big time, even bigger time, because Hamblin showed him there was something wonderful you could do with it.

38:26.511 --> 38:33.540
And the first thing I did when he showed me what you could do with it, which was to exploit it, if you will, in a scholarly manner, to give it to other people.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.001
Don't let it sit in the vault.

38:35.021 --> 38:40.748
It can sit in the vault and you can still give it to other people if you put it in a book, if you make the book your repository.

38:40.768 --> 38:45.594
So I could be a private individual and turn myself into a public repository, which is what I wanted to do.

38:46.075 --> 38:47.316
I didn't want the stuff.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.815
Yes, it had value, and I was aware of that.

38:49.835 --> 38:51.321
No, I didn't give a shit.

38:52.024 --> 38:52.767
Not ever.

38:52.827 --> 38:54.353
If I had ever once collected

38:55.058 --> 39:01.867
with the spirit that I was investing and that I was going to get some great money out of it at some point, I would have quit a long time ago.

39:01.887 --> 39:08.996
What motivated me was that I was a scholar who was told at Washington, you don't bother to apply here for your PhD.

39:09.056 --> 39:09.797
We won't accept you.

39:10.037 --> 39:10.999
Well, fuck you guys.

39:11.339 --> 39:14.183
I'll show you I can do scholarly work without you bastards.

39:14.663 --> 39:19.750
So I've subsequently written more books than any fucker on that staff today has written.

39:19.915 --> 39:20.936
More.

39:20.956 --> 39:23.880
And I intend to write six more because I'm going to blow those bastards away.

39:24.201 --> 39:25.943
I still want to blow them away.

39:25.963 --> 39:29.728
I want to tell them that they should shut their fucking mouth instead of being so arrogant.

39:29.788 --> 39:35.595
Don't run off poor young students who care because you're so goddamn bright.

39:35.615 --> 39:37.057
You know, I hate that shit.

39:37.077 --> 39:38.239
I hate it with people today.

39:38.439 --> 39:40.982
And I really, when I find it, it's worse than being... What did you do?

39:41.002 --> 39:42.104
What did you do with it, you?

39:42.945 --> 39:43.746
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

39:44.266 --> 39:48.272
Well, at Yale, now you're on another subject.

39:48.292 --> 39:50.094
Well, I know, but... It's fine.

39:50.114 --> 39:51.196
Don't put any of that shit out.

39:51.376 --> 39:58.667
No, there was a period at the end of that sentence, so I figured it was... The point is, Hamblin did show me.

39:58.967 --> 40:04.155
Hamblin showed me how important it would be if I could share it.

40:04.175 --> 40:05.176
He said, well, that would be good.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.299
I said, yeah, Bob, that looks like it's really good.

40:07.319 --> 40:11.185
That was the point at which LD realized...

40:11.857 --> 40:18.132
that it was worthwhile to keep going to pursue more people, that it was worthwhile to bring all that stuff back.

40:18.512 --> 40:20.156
I tell you what else was fascinating.

40:20.176 --> 40:28.195
I told you I'd bring the stories back from the people, but I'd bring the artifacts back, and quite often, though I'm not going to give you an example on the tape, I would bring from one person

40:28.175 --> 40:29.276
a manuscript.

40:29.497 --> 40:31.259
Well, I'll give you a simple example.

40:31.279 --> 40:36.746
And I would bring from another family cluster some more manuscripts that sort of jigsawed into it.

40:37.067 --> 40:45.858
It was so interesting, I could go to three different places in the country and bring back materials that, when I put them together in Farmington, made a complete manuscript, so to speak.

40:46.339 --> 40:47.661
I can't think of one right now.

40:47.741 --> 40:49.263
But it was fascinating.

40:49.283 --> 40:50.104
I did it all the time.

40:50.505 --> 40:52.327
You said you used Blotner as a road map.

40:52.727 --> 40:53.048
Right.

40:53.068 --> 40:55.231
Give me an example of what he would do.

40:55.351 --> 40:56.933
Oh, I read about an exhibit...

40:57.470 --> 41:02.418
that had been done early on in New Jersey by a man, someone named Demarest.

41:03.580 --> 41:05.503
Demarest.

41:05.723 --> 41:06.424
D-E-M-E-R-E-S.

41:06.484 --> 41:07.726
A-S-T, I guess.

41:08.187 --> 41:24.152
And I'd read about that, and it turned out that it was a bunch of... It was a bunch of manuscripts and signed books that had been put on exhibit once early on, and he'd alluded to this lady, Myrtle Ramey Demarest.

41:24.723 --> 41:43.693
I read about her, and then I started following her up, and it turned out that she was an early high school girlfriend of Bill's, to whom he had given sketches for a yearbook, an 1813 yearbook that never got made, manuscript poems, drawings, inscribed books.

41:44.634 --> 41:45.836
It was fabulous.

41:45.916 --> 41:47.118
I ended up flying.

41:47.359 --> 41:50.123
It took me two and a half years to trace her daughter.

41:50.744 --> 41:51.265
down.

41:51.385 --> 41:54.430
She's living in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.

41:55.271 --> 41:57.255
I hunted all over New Jersey and other folks.

41:57.275 --> 41:59.819
I went through phone books, I went through newspapers.

41:59.839 --> 42:00.901
I couldn't find her anywhere.

42:00.941 --> 42:04.687
I finally went back to Oxford and I started asking Ramey's there.

42:05.127 --> 42:07.491
Did you know that this archive existed?

42:07.591 --> 42:07.952
No.

42:08.132 --> 42:09.254
You were just following a trail?

42:09.354 --> 42:09.555
No.

42:09.575 --> 42:13.221
In Blotner I'd read that he had described a few things.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.645
The 1913 yearbook drawings.

42:15.685 --> 42:16.566
He'd seen them.

42:17.727 --> 42:19.149
So they're out there?

42:19.429 --> 42:21.231
They're not out there now because I went and found them.

42:21.251 --> 42:22.173
Why didn't you ask Blotner?

42:22.713 --> 42:24.035
Blotner didn't remember shit.

42:24.315 --> 42:26.598
And furthermore, I didn't know Blotner at the time.

42:26.698 --> 42:29.262
And furthermore, Blotner's notes were shabby.

42:29.882 --> 42:32.886
And furthermore, he had a huge archive and he could never find anything in it.

42:33.347 --> 42:37.051
I did subsequently start going to him and asking him for help.

42:37.071 --> 42:39.675
And by that time, he wouldn't give me much.

42:39.695 --> 42:40.656
It wasn't that he wouldn't give me.

42:40.696 --> 42:41.457
I take that back.

42:41.808 --> 42:44.952
He was helpful, and I now own his archive.

42:45.673 --> 42:48.516
I bought his entire archive, all the letters, all everything.

42:48.536 --> 42:49.117
I'll show it to you.

42:49.137 --> 42:49.958
It's phenomenal.

42:50.258 --> 42:53.902
I bought the entire archive that he used to put together the biography.

42:54.123 --> 42:56.305
I brought it back to this collection.

42:56.325 --> 42:58.468
It is sensational.

42:58.568 --> 43:00.550
It's about 20,000 letters.

43:00.570 --> 43:04.575
So I finally ended up there, and the daughter was there, and she was very impressed by me.

43:05.517 --> 43:21.855
and for a sum of money she i got there she said well there's not really much here that mama has well mama was in an institution there she was still alive but she was in her 90s and she said i called my sister and neither she nor i wants this stuff and you're welcome to it she said i know if mama were alive

43:22.122 --> 43:22.883
And she wasn't.

43:22.903 --> 43:23.584
She's in a coma.

43:25.287 --> 43:25.967
She was real ill.

43:25.988 --> 43:27.630
She was like in a coma.

43:27.650 --> 43:30.033
She said, we couldn't really talk to Mama, but it's really ours.

43:30.133 --> 43:33.899
And she said, if Mama were alive, she loved Faulkner, and she saved this.

43:33.939 --> 43:37.464
This was her collection, but we'd like you to have this.

43:37.504 --> 43:39.787
She had spread out on the table all these manuscripts.

43:39.807 --> 43:44.774
No, they didn't give it to me, but I bought it relatively inexpensively.

43:44.875 --> 43:45.936
It was all the money I had.

43:46.338 --> 43:47.560
So it wasn't expensive.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.123
I took out another loan.

43:49.163 --> 43:51.266
So let's talk about ethics.

43:51.346 --> 43:54.792
I bought 10 inscribed books, including an inscribed marble font.

43:54.812 --> 43:58.638
I bought typescripts, manuscripts, drawings.

43:58.658 --> 44:00.862
I bought the collection for $16,000.

44:00.922 --> 44:03.927
This was in like 1978 or nine, I don't remember.

44:03.947 --> 44:05.409
This is in West Virginia now?

44:05.429 --> 44:11.299
Yes, and these people I flew there at my expense, these people were absolutely thrilled to have $16,000.

44:11.617 --> 44:16.885
Today, the one book to Myrtle Ramey, The Marvel Fawn, is about a $50,000 book.

44:17.525 --> 44:18.907
But it wasn't for me.

44:18.968 --> 44:22.052
I never looked at it for money.

44:23.254 --> 44:24.295
I never did it for money.

44:24.636 --> 44:31.546
The $16,000, the way I judged how to pay them that much, was because I had to take a loan and I was flat broke.

44:31.566 --> 44:34.069
And that was the extent of my line of credit.

44:34.229 --> 44:36.072
Now, I gave them as much as I could get.

44:36.305 --> 44:39.089
I suspect if I could have borrowed 20, I would have paid her 20.

44:39.270 --> 44:40.371
I thought the stuff even then.

44:40.391 --> 44:43.456
What did the banks think when you went to them and said, I need some money to buy books?

44:43.917 --> 44:44.318
That was a big help.

44:44.338 --> 44:49.245
That was a big help to me because I couldn't go to my dad very often outright.

44:49.406 --> 44:56.297
I would go to the bank and a man named Rolla Gordon, who was the president of the little bank in Farmington, he was so turned on by what I was doing.

44:56.317 --> 44:56.617
Really?

44:56.637 --> 45:01.705
That though he had no appreciation of Faulkner because he was no more literate than my dad,

45:01.938 --> 45:03.400
Yet he's a very bright man.

45:03.501 --> 45:04.823
What was the name of the bank?

45:04.843 --> 45:06.886
Mercantile Bank of Farmington.

45:06.906 --> 45:09.270
Rolla Gordon was absolutely wonderful.

45:09.631 --> 45:10.953
He believed in me.

45:11.013 --> 45:13.698
He didn't think I was irresponsible.

45:13.718 --> 45:21.651
And he made loans available to me, not because he wanted his bank to loan more money, and not because he knew that I had my father, if I got in a tight mic, bail me out.

45:21.935 --> 45:23.918
but because he believed in what I was doing.

45:23.958 --> 45:25.741
He was an antique car collector.

45:25.761 --> 45:28.565
He knows passion when he sees it.

45:28.685 --> 45:28.905
Okay.

45:28.946 --> 45:30.969
What did you secure these loans with?

45:30.989 --> 45:31.569
Nothing.

45:31.590 --> 45:33.993
He gave them to me always without collateral.

45:34.013 --> 45:34.654
Geez.

45:34.674 --> 45:35.455
He was wonderful.

45:35.475 --> 45:36.176
He believed in me.

45:37.679 --> 45:44.429
Frequently when I'd go to have to pay those loans back, I would pay them back out of a certain amount of money that I got each year for my trust.

45:44.649 --> 45:47.233
I had one trust my dad set up for me.

45:47.483 --> 45:48.846
I still have that trust today.

45:48.906 --> 45:52.254
I take the monthly dividends and put them into my timeless press.

45:52.294 --> 45:54.339
I don't take a salary from time.

45:54.359 --> 45:56.304
But I would take that money and I'd pay my loans back.

45:57.166 --> 46:00.193
Or occasionally I'd get my dad to pop.

46:00.865 --> 46:02.307
for a book or for books.

46:03.028 --> 46:04.090
But that was pulling teeth.

46:04.150 --> 46:05.592
And I would get him to help me.

46:05.612 --> 46:06.253
How about your mother?

46:06.473 --> 46:10.639
One time, I took a bunch of antiques to acquire the Phil Stone collection.

46:10.659 --> 46:13.163
I took a bunch of precious antiques.

46:13.283 --> 46:15.045
Our reading, you and your wife.

46:15.065 --> 46:17.669
Well, in that case, those were marital property.

46:18.611 --> 46:25.220
And I took those horns, horn phonographs, a bunch of antique thought machines.

46:25.240 --> 46:30.788
And I said, Jan, I know that these Faulkner manuscripts in the Phil Stone collection are so superb.

46:31.510 --> 46:34.813
And so I contacted a California slot machine company.

46:34.833 --> 46:38.397
They brought a big trailer and unloaded our house with a bunch of stuff.

46:38.617 --> 46:40.019
Where the hell did you get these things?

46:40.359 --> 46:42.942
Oh, I've been collecting them all over and I bought them for almost nothing.

46:42.962 --> 46:47.086
And so I was able to put the Phil Stone collection together for almost no money.

46:47.126 --> 46:48.568
Were they Midwestern type of things?

46:48.588 --> 46:54.214
Wonderful antique slot machines, porn photographs, brass cash registers, Americana.

46:54.554 --> 46:55.695
Beautiful, beautiful things.

46:55.795 --> 46:56.556
So you sold them?

46:56.857 --> 46:58.239
I sold a number of them.

46:58.359 --> 46:59.380
What did your wife think?

46:59.400 --> 47:01.643
Well, I don't remember that she was grossly unhappy.

47:01.663 --> 47:03.325
There were a few items she didn't want me to sell.

47:03.886 --> 47:08.051
But, you know, I think she appreciated it at that point, what I was doing.

47:08.512 --> 47:10.054
It was real significant.

47:10.074 --> 47:16.682
Out of that collection, that was the only time I took our antiques and acquired a cluster.

47:16.702 --> 47:18.645
But that cluster was the most significant of all.

47:19.145 --> 47:22.830
When I went to Birmingham, Alabama,

47:23.553 --> 47:29.198
Emily Stone had already, by the time I got to the collection, I was Johnny-come very lately.

47:29.218 --> 47:30.980
It had been offered all around the country.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.241
This was in 1978.

47:32.301 --> 47:35.945
It was right before I met Hamlet.

47:35.965 --> 47:39.848
She had offered the collection of Virginia to Ole Miss.

47:39.868 --> 47:40.989
To the University of Virginia.

47:41.010 --> 47:41.710
Yes, to the University.

47:41.730 --> 47:44.693
Which has, we should point out, a very significant bucket collection.

47:44.713 --> 47:51.079
Mary, none of these institutions would pay her the $50,000 she was asking.

47:51.582 --> 48:08.604
There were 15 inscribed books in the collection to Phil, including the three Snopes trilogy books that Faulkner had dedicated to Phil Stone, inscribed to the dedicatee, the personal inscriptions.

48:08.624 --> 48:12.549
There was the 606-page hand-corrected carbon typescript of the Hamlet.

48:12.569 --> 48:20.239
There was the typescript of the wishing tree, which he had inscribed to his godson, Philip Stone, Phil's son.

48:21.400 --> 48:25.946
There was the most amazing cove of books and manuscripts.

48:25.966 --> 48:27.488
What did it do to you when you see this?

48:27.588 --> 48:32.034
Well, Emily said, oh, Mr. Krodsky, I'm so glad you're here.

48:32.114 --> 48:33.997
I said, Emily, these things are beautiful.

48:34.017 --> 48:34.718
I stayed with her.

48:34.738 --> 48:36.700
I stayed two days there.

48:36.721 --> 48:37.281
I met her daughter.

48:37.722 --> 48:40.205
Now, you heard about it after other people had passed on?

48:40.225 --> 48:43.830
Long after the fact Jim Merriweather had suggested that I write her.

48:45.295 --> 48:47.198
All these other people had declined to buy it.

48:47.218 --> 48:50.383
Is there a feeling of anxiety that, oh, shit, I might have missed it?

48:50.403 --> 48:50.844
It's gone?

48:50.864 --> 48:53.128
No, because I didn't even know about it until he told me about it.

48:53.408 --> 48:54.610
He said, I think it's still there.

48:54.670 --> 49:02.403
But what got me was that after I got there, I was amazed to learn that those people had all passed it.

49:02.423 --> 49:03.825
I said, how much are you asking for this?

49:03.845 --> 49:05.688
She said, sheepishly, well, we won.

49:05.728 --> 49:08.012
My daughter and I, she was absolutely broke.

49:07.992 --> 49:10.242
She was living penuriously.

49:10.262 --> 49:11.850
We want $50,000.

49:11.930 --> 49:13.919
I said, oh, Emily, that's an awful lot of money.

49:13.999 --> 49:16.973
I thought in my mind, even at the time, Jesus.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.223
This isn't a lot of money.

49:19.243 --> 49:22.308
This is what it's worth, and then it's worth a lot more.

49:22.568 --> 49:24.791
Where was this, in California?

49:25.272 --> 49:26.975
No, it was in Birmingham, Alabama.

49:27.055 --> 49:29.378
I'm sorry, Montgomery, Alabama.

49:29.438 --> 49:30.319
Let's correct that.

49:30.420 --> 49:31.601
It's Montgomery.

49:31.621 --> 49:33.264
So I wrote her, and she wrote me back.

49:33.444 --> 49:34.105
I wrote her again.

49:34.185 --> 49:34.906
She wrote me back.

49:35.227 --> 49:36.088
I flew down there.

49:36.328 --> 49:37.470
I flew down a second time.

49:37.530 --> 49:38.832
I met with her attorneys.

49:38.912 --> 49:42.758
We created an agreement where, for $35,000,

49:42.991 --> 49:47.402
which they found more than satisfactory, I would buy those materials.

49:47.783 --> 49:49.588
That's when I knew I didn't have any more money.

49:49.668 --> 49:56.786
I borrowed 18,000 from the bank, and I sold the antiques for about 18 or 20.

49:57.247 --> 49:58.209
And there I got my money.

49:58.951 --> 50:00.595
So they came down from the 50?

50:00.929 --> 50:03.593
They came down to 35 from the 50.

50:03.613 --> 50:05.035
And so you asked me about ethics.

50:05.095 --> 50:09.841
I, in my appraisal, when I did my paperwork, I appraised it at about $175,000.

50:09.881 --> 50:16.391
But by the same token, that was... But what does $175,000 mean when three different institutions, and they didn't tell you the third one, wouldn't pay for it?

50:16.411 --> 50:17.672
No, no, because that was the market.

50:17.712 --> 50:18.934
The market was quite clear.

50:18.994 --> 50:19.355
There you go.

50:19.395 --> 50:21.057
So talk to me about ethics.

50:21.157 --> 50:25.984
I thought in my head of heads, I said, Brodsky, you're making a hell of a deal here.

50:26.004 --> 50:26.505
Well, you did.

50:26.525 --> 50:28.928
But others had the same opportunity.

50:29.178 --> 50:34.226
Listen, James Lennox bought George Washington's farewell address for $2,300.

50:34.627 --> 50:38.072
You know why he has it in the Library of Congress, doesn't?

50:38.092 --> 50:39.675
Because they thought it was too much money.

50:39.695 --> 50:39.875
Right.

50:39.915 --> 50:41.458
Well, that's exactly why they have it.

50:41.558 --> 50:42.920
Well, a bunch of assholes, aren't they?

50:42.940 --> 50:43.301
Bunch of assholes.

50:43.321 --> 50:47.768
Do you know why I have the Warner Brothers collection of scripts, of Faulkner's scripts?

50:47.788 --> 50:47.848
No.

50:47.868 --> 50:51.114
Because there were a bunch of ignorant assholes out there, not the least of whom.

50:51.134 --> 50:53.477
The most salient of whom was the University of Virginia.

50:53.498 --> 50:53.598
Yeah.

50:53.878 --> 50:56.282
And when I went down there three years ago, they said, you know,

50:56.735 --> 50:58.877
You're still persona non grata down here.

50:59.217 --> 51:02.921
Because people around here remember you bought those Hollywood scripts.

51:02.981 --> 51:03.741
Why didn't they buy them?

51:03.761 --> 51:04.802
I said, you son of a bitch.

51:04.882 --> 51:07.965
I said that to the dyke.

51:08.005 --> 51:10.828
You know who I mean.

51:10.848 --> 51:11.248
Come on.

51:11.508 --> 51:12.930
Don't you put that in there.

51:12.950 --> 51:17.334
Don't you dare put that in there.

51:17.354 --> 51:18.675
She said, you're persona non grata.

51:18.695 --> 51:19.656
I said, how come?

51:19.696 --> 51:20.857
I'll give her name in a minute.

51:20.877 --> 51:21.918
You can see I've suppressed it.

51:21.938 --> 51:22.178
Oh, yeah.

51:22.198 --> 51:24.240
Is it worth going down there, by the way?

51:24.260 --> 51:25.441
Is it worth you going there?

51:25.461 --> 51:25.641
Yeah.

51:25.801 --> 51:26.742
Time to take a look.

51:26.722 --> 51:27.703
Absolutely.

51:28.024 --> 51:28.584
No, absolutely.

51:28.604 --> 51:30.587
How do they get good special collections?

51:30.607 --> 51:32.229
They get the greatest Faulkner in the world.

51:32.269 --> 51:32.910
Better than yours?

51:33.090 --> 51:34.231
Oh, yeah.

51:34.251 --> 51:36.975
Oh, yeah, better, but better because Faulkner gave his manuscripts.

51:37.135 --> 51:38.196
The book collection isn't better.

51:38.737 --> 51:41.060
Linton Massey's book collection isn't better.

51:41.120 --> 51:41.440
No way.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.723
This has got to be the best book collection in the world.

51:43.743 --> 51:44.103
OK.

51:44.203 --> 51:51.432
And in its own way, it's also one of the singular best manuscript collections.

51:51.452 --> 51:52.814
Virginia's the best.

51:52.894 --> 51:53.815
It has to be.

51:53.835 --> 51:56.138
It has all of the manuscripts that Faulkner himself did.

51:57.738 --> 51:59.961
It wouldn't have been the best now if it were Massey's.

52:01.243 --> 52:02.765
Mine would have been.

52:02.786 --> 52:08.935
Mississippi has got phenomenal manuscripts because they bought the Roanoke papers from Jill.

52:08.955 --> 52:10.577
And mine are significant.

52:10.597 --> 52:11.899
Texas is fourth.

52:11.919 --> 52:13.361
Why did he give them to Virginia?

52:14.122 --> 52:17.587
Because Linton lived there, and Linton talked him into doing that.

52:17.608 --> 52:19.290
And his daughter lived there.

52:19.945 --> 52:44.130
belong in mississippi oh they really do but the progress had a great hate for mississippi for university of mississippi because they treated them so shabbily that wasn't going to get there but the story is interesting uh virginia doesn't like me because i bought those scripts well virginia was offered them at sixteen thousand dollars by the time i was offered them for 120 000 about 10 other dealers had had them

52:44.245 --> 52:45.672
I wrote a whole story about this.

52:46.194 --> 52:47.038
It's real interesting.

52:47.058 --> 52:48.445
I forgot where in one of the magazines.

52:48.465 --> 52:49.248
I'd like to find that.

52:49.268 --> 52:51.117
I'll show you all that, that I really like that.

52:51.367 --> 52:53.349
That might help in some of this stuff.

52:53.369 --> 52:54.090
I put a lot in print.

52:54.110 --> 52:55.531
You don't have a lot of the stuff I put in there?

52:55.551 --> 52:55.771
I do, yeah.

52:55.791 --> 52:58.574
Oh, yeah, so obviously I haven't had something.

52:58.594 --> 53:04.720
I know about the big find out in... Oh, I wrote about that one, but I also... In California, you know, the day you're leaving.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.962
And I'm going to feel free to use that stuff.

53:06.982 --> 53:11.647
But part of that find, also, I might have talked about how these scripts went from dealer to dealer to dealer.

53:12.288 --> 53:13.128
I think I did.

53:13.148 --> 53:17.813
But the upshot of all that was... Nobody was collecting movie scripts.

53:17.793 --> 53:18.835
No, they weren't.

53:18.935 --> 53:24.808
And the Board of Trustees at Virginia wouldn't allow them to spend $16,000 on a bunch of movie scripts.

53:24.828 --> 53:25.991
So they never really studied them.

53:26.011 --> 53:27.454
It turned out a bunch of them were authentic.

53:27.534 --> 53:28.756
And this is not so long ago.

53:28.857 --> 53:29.999
No, it wasn't long ago at all.

53:30.199 --> 53:31.582
It was about six years ago or seven.

53:31.602 --> 53:32.685
It was stupid.

53:32.705 --> 53:34.088
Real ignorant.

53:34.108 --> 53:34.629
Real ignorant.

53:34.649 --> 53:36.072
So by the time I got offered them,

53:36.845 --> 53:41.172
For 120 grand from that wonderful dealer whose name I've also forgotten right now.

53:41.192 --> 53:41.653
Out of where?

53:41.913 --> 53:42.835
Out of San Francisco.

53:42.955 --> 53:43.616
Warren Howell?

53:43.756 --> 53:44.598
Yeah, out of Warren.

53:44.658 --> 53:48.704
Warren and I, Warren developed a wonderful respect for me.

53:48.724 --> 53:53.632
And that's how I ended up getting what he offered at $120,000 for about $8,000.

53:53.833 --> 53:57.559
I got him for eight grand because he trusted me so much.

53:57.599 --> 54:02.667
I traded him some materials that I had duplicates of, a couple of wills that were signed that he could sell.

54:03.271 --> 54:06.034
But I had $8,000 in what I sent him.

54:06.174 --> 54:10.077
And I said, Warren, and I'm getting ready to send another check right now to his wife.

54:10.117 --> 54:12.519
I said, Warren, I'm going to take those scripts and make books.

54:12.539 --> 54:16.483
The reason we couldn't sell them is because all the people who wanted to buy them wanted to buy the copyrights.

54:16.503 --> 54:17.944
And Warner Brothers held them.

54:18.445 --> 54:20.607
I realized that I could go to Warner Brothers.

54:20.627 --> 54:21.588
That's a whole other story.

54:22.008 --> 54:27.113
I went to the third in command at Warner Brothers and spent three visits with him out there, Marshall Silverman.

54:27.173 --> 54:31.877
And from Marshall, I got the permission to have all the copyrights to publish all those scripts.

54:32.431 --> 54:34.935
And that's what you're seeing now, the Tagalog story, Battle Tribe.

54:35.115 --> 54:35.956
Did they ask for money?

54:36.697 --> 54:38.761
No, they said because... That's very unlike that.

54:38.781 --> 54:48.355
Because Warner Brothers said, because you're you, and we know your reputation, and we know that you won't merchandise these, that you will make scholarly projects out of these, we give them to you.

54:48.375 --> 54:49.697
But that's very un-Hollywood.

54:49.757 --> 54:51.179
Of course it was, and they did it.

54:51.199 --> 54:54.304
Hollywood is really the engine that drives...

54:54.436 --> 54:59.786
I'm not bending my arm when I tell you that they did it out of respect for my work.

54:59.807 --> 55:01.049
Marshall told me that.

55:01.069 --> 55:03.213
He said, you are so unique.

55:03.233 --> 55:06.780
He said, I will make this available to you, all these scripts.

55:06.800 --> 55:08.824
And let me tell you something.

55:08.844 --> 55:16.900
In turn, MGM gave me the same rights for virtually no money.

55:17.926 --> 55:19.609
Because they respected my work.

55:19.709 --> 55:23.195
My feeling is buy the stuff and deal with the copyright problem later.

55:23.335 --> 55:24.697
Well, let me tell you what happened.

55:25.058 --> 55:29.565
No dealer, no collector would buy the materials from any of the dealers.

55:29.605 --> 55:35.895
So Warren ended up with it thinking he finally had a buyer who was going to get Warner Brothers to let them have the copyrights.

55:36.717 --> 55:37.538
It fell through.

55:37.838 --> 55:39.420
That's when I started with Warner Brothers.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.121
He said, here's the two people I've worked with.

55:41.182 --> 55:42.443
If you can do anything, fine.

55:42.643 --> 55:44.705
He said, I want you to have these manuscripts.

55:44.925 --> 55:45.286
Who said?

55:45.726 --> 55:46.547
Warren said to me.

55:46.827 --> 55:49.230
He said... But why did he come to you after he went to these other people?

55:49.250 --> 55:50.231
I went to him.

55:50.251 --> 55:51.292
I found out they were there.

55:51.312 --> 55:53.094
He said he'd been turned down by a couple of people.

55:53.134 --> 55:53.494
He had.

55:53.615 --> 55:57.218
And so by the time I came to him, I was also Johnny Cook very lately.

55:57.238 --> 55:59.381
How come Warren Hale didn't give you a call?

56:00.061 --> 56:00.642
Didn't give me a what?

56:00.722 --> 56:02.104
A call and say, I got this stuff.

56:02.124 --> 56:03.525
I don't know why he didn't, but he did.

56:04.265 --> 56:05.947
Maybe he was trying to make a big score.

56:05.967 --> 56:07.209
He was, $120,000.

56:07.269 --> 56:09.532
He bought them for $60,000 from Howard, Peter Howard.

56:10.212 --> 56:12.235
That's another reason why Peter is unlikely.

56:12.255 --> 56:13.797
Peter sold them on to Warren.

56:14.378 --> 56:15.519
Peter bought them for $30,000.

56:15.539 --> 56:19.905
Peter sold them to Howard, to the guy you just told me, Warren, for $60,000.

56:19.925 --> 56:22.868
Warren put them up for sale for $120,000.

56:22.888 --> 56:25.492
They'd started out of Virginia at $16,000.

56:25.512 --> 56:27.634
They'd gone through a few hands until they got to Peter at $30,000.

56:28.756 --> 56:30.999
From Peter at $30,000 to Warren at $60,000.

56:31.039 --> 56:31.980
What did you pay?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.782
I paid $8,000.

56:35.348 --> 56:37.571
And not one penny of it was cash.

56:37.592 --> 56:40.436
Well, in other words, Warren took a bath?

56:40.596 --> 56:45.123
Warren took a huge bath because he took great respect for me, and he'd never taken a bath.

56:45.143 --> 56:47.006
He said, let me tell you something.

56:47.026 --> 56:49.871
It sounds to me like he took a $22,000 bath.

56:49.931 --> 56:50.792
He did.

56:50.812 --> 56:51.974
He took more than that.

56:51.994 --> 56:53.156
He took about that.

56:53.176 --> 56:54.278
He took a $22,000 bath.

56:54.298 --> 56:55.720
That's right.

56:56.257 --> 56:57.098
And he did it.

56:57.118 --> 57:00.221
He said, you only paid $8,000 for them?

57:00.241 --> 57:02.723
And I didn't pay one piece of it in cash at that time.

57:02.743 --> 57:08.269
And they were things that I computed that I had put out in cash for various things I traded in.

57:08.289 --> 57:09.891
$8,000.

57:09.911 --> 57:14.035
But what he liked about me, Nick, and this is why I got them like that.

57:14.735 --> 57:16.397
He could have held them forever.

57:16.417 --> 57:16.937
He didn't need the money.

57:16.957 --> 57:19.480
I said, you know what I'm going to do?

57:19.520 --> 57:20.301
I'm going to publish these things.

57:20.361 --> 57:21.522
I said, I'm going to go get them.

57:22.042 --> 57:23.163
They're copyrights.

57:23.183 --> 57:24.365
And he said, well, I hope you do.

57:24.445 --> 57:25.226
Here they are.

57:25.546 --> 57:27.909
I bought them from him with no copyrights.

57:27.929 --> 57:29.932
He said, but I'll put in my good word.

57:29.952 --> 57:31.574
I said, I think I can get them.

57:31.594 --> 57:35.258
I went out to California, made the contacts.

57:35.278 --> 57:35.859
I went out there.

57:35.879 --> 57:36.820
I got the permissions.

57:37.701 --> 57:38.562
I started publishing.

57:38.582 --> 57:44.910
I said, Warren, if I ever get them published, I will give you and your wife the royalties.

57:45.464 --> 58:10.999
I'm not doing it for the royalties. I said I'll set it up so that you get a certain percentage and Warren's brother can have a certain percentage. Each ten percent. I have sent checks to his wife. He died. She is so appreciative she said oh Mr. Brodsky I never dreamed of what you said you'd do. It wasn't even part of a written agreement. I said Warren if you do this with me I promise you there is no written agreement. I said I promise you that I will send whatever royalties I can set up

58:12.228 --> 58:14.151
Your wife will get them or you'll get them.

58:14.171 --> 58:16.275
And maybe eventually it'll pay back some of your loss.

58:17.857 --> 58:22.966
She is still receiving royalties annually for those books.

58:23.086 --> 58:24.809
And that just pleases me no end.

58:24.969 --> 58:26.933
Because I didn't want him to take a bath.

58:26.953 --> 58:29.377
Why wouldn't he sell it to Virginia for $8,000?

58:30.138 --> 58:33.103
Those bastards wouldn't have done anything in a way.

58:33.143 --> 58:34.185
You know what appealed to him?

58:34.503 --> 58:42.537
What appealed to him was that I would make that attempt to try to keep my word good with him, and that I would publish them.

58:42.777 --> 58:45.182
He loved that notion that I would turn them into scholarship.

58:45.442 --> 58:46.344
Warren loved that.

58:47.025 --> 58:48.067
Now that's how I got those.

58:48.347 --> 58:49.149
How do you get stuff?

58:49.189 --> 58:50.832
Why didn't Peterson get stuff?

58:50.852 --> 58:54.177
He didn't know how to appeal to the right instincts and the people who had it.

58:54.197 --> 58:56.241
When I went to get the Cummins collection,

58:56.558 --> 58:57.480
I got in.

58:57.500 --> 59:01.527
That's a whole other tale that I'm not going to tell you right now because I'm starting to exhaust myself.

59:01.547 --> 59:03.911
Maybe I'll tell you on the way home.

59:03.931 --> 59:06.455
When this tape runs out in about 30 seconds, we're going to take a break.

59:06.475 --> 59:08.078
How do you get stuff from people?

59:08.098 --> 59:09.781
Well, you have to appeal to their needs.

59:09.841 --> 59:14.950
And their needs were infrequently monetary.

59:14.970 --> 59:16.592
They were partially monetary.

59:17.033 --> 59:18.836
There were all kinds of needs.

59:19.137 --> 59:21.621
In the case of Bill Cummins, it was more an emotional need.

59:22.073 --> 59:24.737
And I'll explain that to you at another time.

59:24.817 --> 59:26.099
What's the name of this Cummins person?

59:26.139 --> 59:26.740
Doe.

59:26.760 --> 59:26.960
D-O.

59:27.040 --> 59:27.861
That's her name.

59:27.881 --> 59:29.564
Her name is Dorothy B. Cummins.

59:29.584 --> 59:37.134
She's the wife of Sachs Cummins, Faulkner's editor at Random House, from 36 to 58.

59:37.635 --> 59:40.980
Dorothy B. C-U-M-M-I-N-G-S, right?

59:41.000 --> 59:41.060
No.

59:41.080 --> 59:41.360
C-U-M-M-I-N-S.

59:41.380 --> 59:41.541
Cummins.

59:41.561 --> 59:41.661
Okay.

59:41.681 --> 59:42.041
Wow.

59:42.121 --> 59:43.383
We're doing pretty good.

59:44.124 --> 59:45.166
Not a lot of stuff.

59:45.186 --> 59:45.386
Yeah.

59:46.648 --> 59:48.070
We ought to take a break if I haven't.

59:48.150 --> 59:48.250
Yeah.

59:48.415 --> 59:51.941
If I haven't run over another one, I'm going to be a little late here, but we're fine.

59:51.961 --> 59:53.944
You're getting the best out of me now.

59:54.385 --> 59:54.826
That's good.

59:54.846 --> 59:59.113
What I'm going to do, I need to stop by the printing office for one minute here.

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:00.315
That's right.

01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:03.760
There's a pulling driving from Farmington to Mississippi Vistas, you're saying.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.224
Over to this highway and down to Oxford.

01:00:06.244 --> 01:00:07.106
This is corn now.

01:00:07.466 --> 01:00:10.992
Let me tell you why I'm glad I drove you to Farmington.

01:00:11.012 --> 01:00:13.236
You've got to share with me now something, just as friends.

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.558
Let's be friends.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.825
Who I was.

01:00:17.226 --> 01:00:19.010
I wasn't a southerner.

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.155
It's real strange, another part of the hotel.

01:00:21.175 --> 01:00:23.521
I was always feeling somewhat outsider there.

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:24.283
It scared me.

01:00:24.303 --> 01:00:25.466
It always scared me in the south.

01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:28.092
Even to this day, a little bit.

01:00:28.612 --> 01:00:30.054
There was always that old lingering shit.

01:00:30.074 --> 01:00:32.196
When you and I were growing up, we're probably about the same age.

01:00:32.436 --> 01:00:33.978
You know how the South was so scary?

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:34.799
Oh, yeah.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.081
You know all that stuff.

01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:39.244
We all watched To Kill a Mockingbird, you know, in the 1960s.

01:00:39.364 --> 01:00:41.367
How old are you?

01:00:41.447 --> 01:00:41.907
I'm 47.

01:00:42.007 --> 01:00:43.529
Well, we're about right now.

01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:45.651
OK, so we know how scary the South was.

01:00:45.671 --> 01:00:47.874
It had an image of being scary.

01:00:48.495 --> 01:00:51.318
Well, I never lost those fears completely.

01:00:51.378 --> 01:00:52.900
So a lot of the poems are paranoid.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.424
I want you to read my Mississippi Vistas from start to finish.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:57.505
I'm very proud of it.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:01:05.544
It will show you the character who goes quite often from Farmington over the little highway you thought was beautiful, 32, down this stretch.

01:01:06.046 --> 01:01:09.317
You'll see all my perceptions in that book, whether I was looking at cows.
