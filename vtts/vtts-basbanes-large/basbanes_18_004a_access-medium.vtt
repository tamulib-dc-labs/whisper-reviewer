WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:04.743
The tape now, we're talking to Joan Didion.

00:05.004 --> 00:05.625
Why a novel?

00:06.446 --> 00:12.996
I guess you have been quoted as saying that you've kind of lost interest in writing novels.

00:14.078 --> 00:14.498
I did.

00:14.999 --> 00:24.013
I mean, I had sort of lost...

00:26.204 --> 00:27.866
faith that they were going anywhere.

00:28.366 --> 00:33.912
I mean, I didn't have a very good time writing Democracy.

00:33.953 --> 00:37.536
Although once it was finished, I liked it.

00:38.678 --> 00:51.652
But I didn't have a very strong impulse to subject myself and the entire household to that kind of prolonged period of doing something that you weren't having a very good time with.

00:52.513 --> 00:54.695
So I didn't do it for a while.

00:54.715 --> 00:56.177
I did other stuff.

00:57.018 --> 01:08.275
I was interested in this period, and I had already done Miami, which treated some of the same material in nonfiction.

01:15.866 --> 01:26.282
And suddenly I wanted to do something with the material, but I also wanted, suddenly I got the idea that I could do a thriller.

01:26.701 --> 01:33.147
I'd never done a novel plot, a novel where everything had to work like a clock.

01:34.428 --> 01:43.396
And so that idea interested me, and I started doing it in a tentative way.

01:44.316 --> 01:45.658
I'm sorry, what was that word?

01:45.678 --> 01:46.158
In a what way?

01:46.178 --> 01:47.239
In a tentative way.

01:47.259 --> 01:47.359
Okay.

01:48.540 --> 01:55.206
And then I would not get very far with it and set it aside and do something else.

01:55.827 --> 02:08.138
And then finally, it was really just last summer, I took all these pieces of fall starts and sat down with them.

02:08.459 --> 02:11.061
Well, it was a computer file.

02:11.081 --> 02:12.362
It was dated August 31.

02:13.483 --> 02:22.231
And said to John, I'm going to spend the entire fall working on this.

02:22.251 --> 02:25.294
And if I'm not finished by Christmas, I'm going to.

02:25.949 --> 02:26.610
not do it.

02:26.830 --> 02:29.073
And then I did do it by Christmas.

02:29.794 --> 02:32.098
It was actually a terrific period.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.901
It was a good way to work on something.

02:36.624 --> 02:40.529
You can't keep plot ends in your mind if you go away from it.

02:41.110 --> 02:46.458
Do you find that imposing deadlines on yourself is the only way to work?

02:46.738 --> 02:53.307
Well, it is at a certain point when essentially all the stuff is there.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.972
You just have to sit down and pull it together.

02:56.933 --> 03:01.317
And at that point, a deadline is very... I need a deadline, yeah.

03:02.037 --> 03:06.141
And do you impose daily demands on yourself, requirements?

03:06.301 --> 03:07.482
Well, I work every day.

03:07.542 --> 03:13.788
But I don't have a set number of words or pages.

03:14.849 --> 03:18.292
You know, when I was... Some days you end up with a negative.

03:18.332 --> 03:22.095
And sometimes the most useful days you end up with a negative...

03:22.531 --> 03:25.716
Word count, so to speak, but you've made progress in your thought.

03:25.976 --> 03:26.637
Yeah, exactly.

03:27.659 --> 03:33.027
When you talk about the material that you had, could you get into that a little bit for me?

03:33.087 --> 03:40.138
Well, I mean, by the time I sat down, I... I mean, based on, you know, the Miami stuff that you said, you had material.

03:40.158 --> 03:41.921
I'm just wondering if you could probe that a little bit.

03:42.081 --> 03:47.610
I mean, I have been interested in Iran-Contra, but...

03:48.518 --> 03:50.781
in what became known as a Lancome.

03:50.801 --> 03:52.643
So I've been interested in it through the 80s.

03:53.704 --> 04:00.912
I was spending some time in Washington on some things that I eventually didn't do, and also in Miami.

04:01.392 --> 04:12.805
And I had kind of just been interested in that whole stuff that was going on down there.

04:13.831 --> 04:33.669
And so I had a lot of clippings and I had a lot of, then when the things started kind of codifying as a ran contract, quote unquote, of course then we had the hearings and the, you know, volumes of testimony.

04:34.450 --> 04:38.073
So all of that material was what I had to begin with, right?

04:38.093 --> 04:41.696
I mean, that was way back.

04:41.776 --> 04:43.838
That was the material I wanted to deal with.

04:44.324 --> 05:05.769
But by the time I sat down and tried to pull it together last summer, I also, I mean, I had been working on it in all of these false starts long enough so that I had the characters and I had the sense of the general progression that something would, that she would be set up in some way.

05:06.070 --> 05:14.179
I don't know exactly how, obviously, but all, I mean, a whole, there was a, there was a, a,

05:14.378 --> 05:19.815
There was a world not created, but just on the verge of being created.

05:20.487 --> 05:34.811
Is this woman, is this character, I mean, somebody that you know, and I don't mean in a real sense, but I mean, you know this kind of woman who you describe her at one point as going feral, for instance.

05:37.315 --> 05:44.487
I'm just wondering, you start also with an image of this person, as Michiko pointed out in the lead of her review.

05:44.467 --> 05:49.053
You start with this image of this person, so uncharacteristic, out of place.

05:50.535 --> 05:57.846
I'm wondering how you fuse the fictional elements with the factual elements to make a separate work.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.811
I don't know how much of a question that is.

06:02.312 --> 06:04.935
There aren't any factual elements in that character.

06:05.196 --> 06:05.696
There are none.

06:06.017 --> 06:06.297
No.

06:07.219 --> 06:10.423
The only factual element in that entire character...

06:10.758 --> 06:14.364
He said, I once saw a woman eating a chocolate parfait and bacon.

06:14.524 --> 06:15.225
And bacon.

06:15.245 --> 06:17.809
And bacon at the Kahala Hilton in Honolulu.

06:17.829 --> 06:18.010
Wow.

06:18.651 --> 06:35.297
And she had a lot of, I imagine that she was the young wife of a visiting military high place, high officer, because there were a lot of naval aides kind of hovering around asking her what she wanted.

06:36.138 --> 06:41.385
and she was not very happy and very bored, and she did not want to go to the boring museum.

06:41.885 --> 06:43.207
That was what she said.

06:43.768 --> 06:48.594
But that was the only, it was the chocolate parfait and bacon that was the only part of it.

06:48.614 --> 06:53.220
But do you create narratives for these, for people like this, when you see situations like that?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.603
Yes, I mean, yes, I have since I was a little girl.

06:58.206 --> 07:00.349
I mean, you immediately make up a story.

07:00.589 --> 07:02.011
For them, that makes sense for them.

07:02.131 --> 07:02.451
Yeah.

07:03.453 --> 07:04.714
I love doing that myself.

07:04.894 --> 07:05.335
Yeah.

07:05.686 --> 07:06.707
Well, you kind of have to.

07:06.988 --> 07:21.005
When I was little, during World War II, my father was stationed in Colorado Springs for a couple of years, and we lived on a street.

07:21.045 --> 07:34.461
At the end of the street, there was a hospital of some kind, a private hospital, and there was another little girl on the street whose father ran the hospital.

07:35.200 --> 07:49.494
And so we used to play on the grounds, and we devised this game of walking around, writing down scraps of what people said, you know, overhearing dialogue and writing it down, and then making up stories.

07:49.534 --> 08:00.024
I mean, it was actually the most fun game I ever devised or had devised for me as a child.

08:00.044 --> 08:03.047
I mean, it was...

08:03.297 --> 08:05.320
Of course you keep on doing that as an adult.

08:06.902 --> 08:19.501
Well, as a professional writer who's also married to a professional writer, I wonder, do you do this with your husband if you're out to dinner and you see some people and you create stories for them?

08:19.801 --> 08:21.604
Absolutely, yes.

08:21.624 --> 08:27.233
We have it down to, we can even talk about them without their knowing it.

08:27.513 --> 08:30.958
I mean, with a certain kind of code we have worked out.

08:32.373 --> 08:37.740
My mother tells a story of being with a friend, and she speaks Greek.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.463
And I forget where they were, certainly here.

08:41.124 --> 08:44.488
And they were talking about this woman, you know, at another table in Greek.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.472
You know, where this is going, right?

08:49.615 --> 08:52.819
And just describing the relationship, you know, what was going on.

08:52.859 --> 08:54.020
She was with a younger man.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.802
She was bleach blonde, the whole thing.

08:56.603 --> 09:01.730
And then they get up to leave, and then the woman said to them in Greek, you know, I hope you enjoyed your lunch or something.

09:01.750 --> 09:01.890
Uh-huh.

09:03.608 --> 09:09.321
And I said, I said, good for her.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.503
I said, you deserve that.

09:10.563 --> 09:11.966
You know, absolutely.

09:12.447 --> 09:15.053
You're so arrogant, so cocky, you know, and

09:15.286 --> 09:16.808
But it is funny.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.572
You never know what's going to happen.

09:20.954 --> 09:32.570
I do notice, having read a number of your husband's books as well, and I even interviewed him, he pays such close attention to detail, to little things.

09:32.711 --> 09:39.560
I even indicated that he subscribes to off-the-wall magazines to get certain things.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.563
And I just notice how you pick up

09:41.543 --> 09:46.593
very precise little details and use them in your writing.

09:46.613 --> 09:55.770
And I wonder if this is something that you pick up from each other in terms of... I think we both are just crazy about details, about specific things.

09:55.790 --> 09:59.417
I was working with a child, a friend, who was

10:00.545 --> 10:06.816
you know, working on an essay for a college application the other day, and I kept thinking, but can you be more specific?

10:06.836 --> 10:08.479
Can you give me a specific here?

10:08.940 --> 10:15.972
I mean, I always, the specific kind of gives it to you.

10:16.795 --> 10:25.070
And it certainly gives it that, I hate to use these reviewers' words, you know, verisimilitude and all that stuff, but it really does.

10:25.110 --> 10:32.222
And also the jargon of the period that you use so effectively, which you haven't heard for a while.

10:32.607 --> 10:37.051
But these people during, you know, around Contra, it seems it's only, what, 12 or so years?

10:37.091 --> 10:39.874
No, it seems longer, doesn't it?

10:39.894 --> 10:48.242
It's almost... Now, is this something that you've been wanting to... Is this a comment for you as much as it is a novel?

10:48.462 --> 10:51.024
I mean, a commentary on your part?

10:52.386 --> 10:57.611
Well, I think you always want a novel to say something.

10:57.871 --> 11:02.395
I mean, not anything you don't set out that way, but as it evolves, you...

11:02.965 --> 11:32.044
You realize that it's about something, and it's not a... I wouldn't want... Because a novel is so complicated and fragile a thing, you can't reduce it to a statement, but it's about the relationship between...

11:32.750 --> 11:41.600
private and public life between politics and responsibility.

11:41.620 --> 11:49.689
You know, all those, I mean, I'm not very comfortable with those words.

11:50.149 --> 11:51.070
Right.

11:51.210 --> 11:59.099
As we're speaking, my wife just walked in and put on my desk this Sunday's New York Times book review, which features your book on the cover.

12:01.642 --> 12:01.742
Yeah.

12:01.762 --> 12:01.862
Yeah.

12:02.703 --> 12:09.694
And as you're talking, I'm frantically jumping to page 10, you know, and I'm looking at this wonderful map they have here.

12:09.774 --> 12:10.976
Isn't that great?

12:11.056 --> 12:11.256
Yeah.

12:11.316 --> 12:12.218
I know, it's so witty.

12:14.201 --> 12:18.307
But did you see this in a way as a kind of a tragic love story?

12:19.028 --> 12:19.349
Yes.

12:20.310 --> 12:21.412
Yeah, that's part of it.

12:21.532 --> 12:25.939
I mean, it's a... That's part of it.

12:28.303 --> 12:29.284
I mean, it's...

12:31.289 --> 12:40.617
But, you know, to keep up your interest for long enough to write a novel, you have to see it as a whole, one day you'll see it as one thing, and another day you'll see it as something else.

12:40.637 --> 12:43.300
And the thing is to try to make those things work together.

12:43.320 --> 13:01.296
I had actually, at one point early on in this book, when I was first messing around with it, not getting very far, I had thought it would be interesting to do a novel that also was a history.

13:01.445 --> 13:09.254
that actually worked as a literal history of something that also worked as a novel.

13:09.354 --> 13:20.187
I mean, it would be, the novel, I mean, the book would be an object that worked in two totally different genres.

13:21.208 --> 13:31.300
Now, John said that I ought to read Simon Shama's Dead Certainties.

13:32.022 --> 13:34.004
Interesting book, yeah.

13:34.204 --> 13:52.783
Yeah, and I didn't read it at the time because I was, the whole idea of this was so turning in my own mind, I didn't want to suddenly see that he had done it already or that, anyway, it ended up that I couldn't do it.

13:53.044 --> 13:56.948
So now I can read Simon Shaman.

13:57.008 --> 14:01.152
I mean, I couldn't make that work in the,

14:01.587 --> 14:03.089
in this book anyway.

14:03.109 --> 14:13.782
Well, do you think, though, that you did succeed in giving, you know, the history in a... It's a poem of the history.

14:13.802 --> 14:14.042
It is.

14:14.343 --> 14:21.011
I mean, it's a... It's a... It's an improvisation on the history.

14:22.773 --> 14:22.993
Hmm.

14:23.013 --> 14:31.003
And, of course, undoubtedly, you want us to come away with an appreciation for the total cynicism of that period and...

14:31.490 --> 14:36.497
Well, there are actual similarities to actual events.

14:36.597 --> 14:55.103
I mean, there were several instances in which American ambassadors were, there were assassination attempts against American ambassadors in an attempt to mobilize American support for, I mean, a demented attempt to mobilize American support for an overt action.

14:56.304 --> 14:59.809
So there were actual things

15:00.869 --> 15:05.638
But then you just kind of forget those things and run with the story.

15:05.698 --> 15:06.660
Sure, absolutely.

15:07.141 --> 15:15.236
Do you see this, now this is, you've got, I guess it's five novels and five works of non-fiction.

15:17.521 --> 15:20.206
Do you see this as a body of work, corpus?

15:21.388 --> 15:22.911
Would you, if...

15:22.891 --> 15:34.022
really suggest to someone who was interested in your work to start with book one and go through book ten, read them in order, and get a sense of what you've been up to.

15:34.062 --> 15:39.948
I mean, that's a general question with the point of entry, but I'm wondering if you... I don't know.

15:39.968 --> 15:43.312
I have no idea because I haven't ever done that.

15:43.632 --> 15:51.480
In my mind,

15:52.844 --> 16:05.261
There is no relation between... I don't see a logical line between Run River and this novel, if you see what I mean.

16:05.281 --> 16:10.708
I don't see a logical development, but I haven't read them in that way.

16:10.728 --> 16:21.383
I mean, I haven't read... At some point after you finish a novel, at some point in the next five years,

16:23.152 --> 16:30.082
you will, or I will, finally get up the nerve to read it through, to read it through again.

16:30.102 --> 16:36.892
I mean, you've read it through so many times when you're working on it, but to read it through as a reader.

16:40.036 --> 16:46.426
But I've never gone back, after that one reading, I've never gone back to read them.

16:47.167 --> 16:49.530
So I'm not too sure.

16:50.860 --> 16:54.405
So the question then... I'm not, if I had to review them, I wouldn't do that.

16:55.226 --> 16:55.967
You wouldn't?

16:55.987 --> 16:57.069
I don't like to look back.

16:57.369 --> 16:57.609
Really?

16:58.230 --> 17:00.574
So completed work for you is completed work.

17:00.614 --> 17:01.956
Completed, yeah.

17:01.976 --> 17:11.569
These writers who are constantly, just to cite one example, I did an interview last year, was it two years ago, with Tim O'Brien and his new novel,

17:11.549 --> 17:18.679
He's been very quietly going back and tinkering like with going after Cagliato for the paperbacks and stuff.

17:18.880 --> 17:19.040
Really?

17:19.060 --> 17:27.292
Yeah, he got an amusing letter from one professor who was reading the hard coverage in the class, and the class was reading the paperback, and they were getting different things.

17:28.494 --> 17:31.017
And I said, Tim, why would you do that?

17:31.197 --> 17:36.565
And he said, well, I have a responsibility to make the most perfect work that I can.

17:36.585 --> 17:37.827
I said, but doesn't that work?

17:38.043 --> 17:39.905
speak for a time in your life.

17:40.506 --> 17:45.751
That's a book you wrote back in the 60s or whatever.

17:45.911 --> 17:55.221
I don't know how you would do it because who you were at that period is so deep in the grain of the book you wrote during that period.

17:57.123 --> 18:07.054
If you started trying to correct it from the perspective of 10 or 20 years later, you would be opening a real book

18:08.553 --> 18:10.018
basket of snakes.

18:10.400 --> 18:17.205
And just to switch gears entirely here and going back to, I haven't really asked you much about the novel.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.951
That's my job to read it and to

18:19.606 --> 18:23.951
to grasp it, but structurally I did find also the narrator.

18:24.712 --> 18:28.076
She reveals elements of herself as we go along.

18:28.136 --> 18:32.701
I mean, at the very beginning, you don't even know if this narrator is a male or a female.

18:33.842 --> 18:35.664
Right, yeah.

18:35.684 --> 18:44.354
And I wonder if you were mindfully working with that part of the structure as well when you were writing this.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.499
No, I hadn't thought of

18:49.120 --> 19:01.217
At one point, I was, as I said in the novel, I was going to have the narrator be more of a character than she is.

19:04.081 --> 19:11.632
She's only a character now to the extent that she has to be, I mean, that she has to have had access to some of these, or an interest.

19:12.353 --> 19:18.722
I didn't even, I wasn't too interested in how she had access, but how she...

19:19.057 --> 19:24.162
But her interest I had to justify in some way.

19:24.643 --> 19:31.190
I mean, she certainly knows the questions to ask even so many years after the fact, you know.

19:32.131 --> 19:38.717
She's very close to being a player in an indirect way.

19:38.737 --> 19:41.981
It's just an observation.

19:43.462 --> 19:47.106
I guess I wanted to know more about her.

19:48.723 --> 19:50.885
And who's she writing this piece for, you know?

19:53.668 --> 19:58.272
I mean, was this an extension of yourself, do you think, this character?

19:58.292 --> 20:00.414
That character is me, yes.

20:00.434 --> 20:00.714
Oh, okay.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.375
I guess that's what I was driving at.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.377
That character is me.

20:04.617 --> 20:06.259
And they're quite secure this way.

20:07.240 --> 20:12.905
And so, but this is not an autobiographical novel in any way.

20:12.945 --> 20:16.148
Not at all, but it's a lot of certain things like I did

20:16.398 --> 20:18.601
have a child at the Westlake School for Girls.

20:19.563 --> 20:20.865
We did have a career day.

20:22.307 --> 20:24.311
So certain things are from that.

20:24.952 --> 20:27.395
There is a party like that.

20:27.456 --> 20:30.520
There used to be a party like that on Academy Award night.

20:30.540 --> 20:34.727
You know, I mean, so certain elements of that Los Angeles life were drawn from

20:36.277 --> 20:37.739
Our real life.

20:38.260 --> 20:40.142
Now, you've been in New York.

20:40.703 --> 20:41.665
We moved here in 1988.

20:42.586 --> 20:44.729
And are you missing the West Coast at all?

20:44.969 --> 20:51.679
Well, I miss certain things about it, like having a garden and cars and swimming pool and supermarkets mainly.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.623
That's what I miss every day is a supermarket.

20:55.666 --> 20:59.432
But, I mean, when I'm there, I miss other things about here.

21:00.033 --> 21:03.098
But, of course, you are a California woman, I guess.

21:03.439 --> 21:05.923
Yeah, I still have a California driver's license.

21:05.943 --> 21:07.326
Okay, that's great.

21:07.346 --> 21:11.713
And I'm not going to ask you questions.

21:12.775 --> 21:15.379
It's not quite a press kit, I have to say, with other...

21:16.456 --> 21:18.281
Articles and magazine pieces.

21:18.321 --> 21:29.892
I'm not going to bore you with questions about your biographical background and stuff, except that I think I know the material that's relevant, and I'm not going to ask you to go over any of that.

21:30.395 --> 21:41.127
Maybe if you could just comment on the various hats that you wear as a screenwriter, a writer of literary journalism, essays, and fiction.

21:41.147 --> 21:45.331
I mean, you really do a lot of different, have a lot of writing, different writing skills.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.753
And how do you decide which one to do?

21:46.833 --> 21:50.216
And is there any particular areas?

21:50.557 --> 21:55.102
Well, how we decide when to do a picture is when we need money.

21:55.883 --> 21:59.486
I mean, we actually always usually have the picture going at some level.

21:59.607 --> 22:00.047
I mean,

22:00.280 --> 22:25.461
a picture an assignment to do a picture at some at some stage but we aren't all I mean for example right now we are have a picture we're going to start at some point this fall but John is finishing a long piece and I am

22:26.774 --> 22:40.988
Well, I am not doing, I'm supposed to be doing along a couple of pieces, but I'm not right now because I'm sort of getting, I have to go away next week and I've sort of been involved in publication stuff.

22:42.449 --> 22:56.123
So it just kind of works out as to how, then we will probably, I will do the pieces when I get back from this trip and

22:56.356 --> 23:11.496
John will by then be finished with his piece, and then we will probably maybe go someplace and take a period of time to do a first draft of his screenplay.

23:11.836 --> 23:14.460
Sounds like waiting for a conjunction of the planets, isn't it?

23:14.520 --> 23:15.641
Yeah.

23:15.862 --> 23:20.828
I mean, it all kind of just has to fall.

23:23.693 --> 23:34.770
So it's how we decide to do something in a real way depends on each other because we do work together on screenplay.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.352
And that anticipates the question.

23:36.373 --> 23:43.083
I mean, physically, as I read, you work quite apart from each other, and I think that's necessary.

23:43.584 --> 23:48.070
But what is there about the dynamic of, I mean, is it a synergistic thing when you work on it?

23:48.091 --> 23:48.551
On screenplay?

23:48.691 --> 23:48.872
Yeah.

23:48.932 --> 23:50.654
Screenplay is not anything like writing.

23:51.095 --> 23:52.317
It's like stuff.

23:53.157 --> 24:03.390
it's making up a story, but it isn't like sitting in a room making that story perfect.

24:03.611 --> 24:06.474
What I mean is it's not something that you do.

24:06.815 --> 24:11.141
The whole essence of writing is that you're sitting there by yourself doing it.

24:11.341 --> 24:17.990
That's the experience, right?

24:18.050 --> 24:20.633
Working on a screenplay, you are generally doing it

24:21.693 --> 24:24.936
First of all, with your collaborator, if you have a collaborator.

24:24.976 --> 24:26.637
Then you are doing it with a director.

24:26.677 --> 24:36.326
Then you are doing it to satisfy locations and satisfy actors.

24:36.426 --> 24:42.271
And the studio is a player all the way through this, too.

24:42.291 --> 24:45.854
So there are essentially dozens of people.

24:46.214 --> 24:49.097
This is before the picture even gets to the production phase.

24:49.117 --> 24:51.379
There are dozens of people who are involved.

24:51.764 --> 24:55.509
at a very close level with what you're doing.

24:56.530 --> 24:58.833
So it's not like sitting in a room by yourself writing.

24:59.955 --> 25:00.776
It's something different.

25:00.796 --> 25:01.818
It's like going to the office.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.842
It's like having a job.

25:05.062 --> 25:07.225
It's a different activity.

25:07.505 --> 25:12.712
And you don't have a proprietary sense of... You couldn't possibly because it's not yours.

25:13.113 --> 25:17.839
I mean, in the first place, you don't even legally own...

25:18.629 --> 25:21.873
Even the characters, if you give the character a name, right?

25:22.234 --> 25:22.394
Exactly.

25:22.414 --> 25:27.080
As many writers have found to their great... Exactly, yeah.

25:27.421 --> 25:30.465
Every word you write on a screenplay belongs to the studio.

25:33.749 --> 25:39.177
So... So it's a different kind of... That's a way to make a living, I guess, is what you're saying.

25:39.217 --> 25:41.259
And it's quite... I like it.

25:41.320 --> 25:45.826
I like... I mean, I find the craft of it interesting.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.349
And I like the people...

25:49.544 --> 25:54.230
And you clearly don't have a thin skin when they fool around with your copy either.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.433
No, no, no, no, no, because there's no ego involved.

25:56.453 --> 26:08.028
It's not, it doesn't involve, I mean, it's not like having somebody edit a piece or suggest that there's something wrong, a deep flaw in a book.

26:08.689 --> 26:09.831
Right.

26:09.851 --> 26:11.894
But let's say, let's go a step further now.

26:12.234 --> 26:15.298
Is there a film deal on this new book?

26:15.447 --> 26:27.265
Well, someone has been talking to me about it, but it's still at such a preliminary stage that I don't know what's going to happen.

26:27.846 --> 26:34.737
But now how would you feel about that being, would you... Well, the person who's been talking to me about it is somebody I would feel very good about.

26:34.757 --> 26:34.857
Okay.

26:36.187 --> 26:42.255
But you probably also would consider that quite an entirely different project from the book in any case.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.136
Yeah, it is.

26:43.236 --> 26:44.418
We have done screenplays.

26:45.019 --> 26:48.724
Well, I just rented The True Confessions a couple of weeks ago.

26:49.164 --> 26:57.396
Working on a screenplay of your own book is an odd thing because to work on a screenplay of a book, you tear the book apart.

26:58.237 --> 27:02.783
I mean, you start, you essentially deconstruct the book.

27:02.803 --> 27:03.584
That's right.

27:05.527 --> 27:05.907
And...

27:07.051 --> 27:16.103
It's odd to do that to your own book, but you do it as if it were somebody else's book.

27:17.686 --> 27:27.439
It's rather easy to set aside the fact that it's your own book when you're in that role.

27:30.153 --> 27:30.654
I get you.

27:32.357 --> 27:38.908
Now that you've done this novel, did you enjoy the exercise, having thought earlier that you might not return to it?

27:39.309 --> 27:39.770
Yeah, I did.

27:39.790 --> 27:40.912
I mean, I did.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.795
I enjoyed doing this one thing.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.059
I enjoyed doing the plot.

27:45.580 --> 27:49.607
I really liked that.

27:50.007 --> 27:52.191
It was really hard.

27:52.472 --> 27:53.293
I mean, I could not.

27:53.994 --> 27:55.637
I didn't know a lot of stuff.

27:56.242 --> 28:00.347
how a lot of stuff was going to play out until, really until I played it out.

28:00.367 --> 28:12.460
I didn't know who Max Epperson was, for example, until the reader does.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.301
That's interesting.

28:13.521 --> 28:14.302
That's interesting.

28:14.703 --> 28:24.173
So working out that, which is one of those things where you put down certain cards in the table and then you try to figure out why they're there.

28:25.216 --> 28:27.559
And is she, in your view, a tragic figure?

28:28.901 --> 28:29.362
Elena?

28:29.803 --> 28:31.786
I don't know whether I would call her tragic.

28:33.628 --> 28:37.134
I thought that she came out rather ahead here, although dead.

28:38.295 --> 28:52.236
I mean, that she had... She had... She had finally found her way to...

28:53.313 --> 28:55.276
to a kind of irreducible truth.

28:59.243 --> 29:01.568
Which is triumphant in a way, isn't it?

29:03.491 --> 29:04.453
Very interesting.

29:04.513 --> 29:06.697
And how about next project?

29:06.757 --> 29:11.024
I want to do something about California.

29:11.044 --> 29:12.527
I don't know exactly in what form.

29:12.547 --> 29:14.330
I've been doing some non-fiction stuff.

29:14.931 --> 29:18.257
I've done a couple of long pieces about California, and I would like to do it.

29:20.026 --> 29:38.929
non-fiction I mean a long kind of extended exploration of California but I have to figure a way to get into it I have to tell you how much I enjoyed your piece on Woodward in the New York Review oh thank you I love

29:39.702 --> 29:41.927
It's really deciding what's news, isn't it?

29:42.349 --> 29:48.804
If you own the bottle of ink, I guess you can... It's just amazing.

29:49.266 --> 29:55.922
Yeah, when I started going through all this stuff, I really found myself kind of astonished.

29:56.290 --> 30:00.957
And how banal and meaningless, some of these quotes.

30:00.977 --> 30:02.779
And I've noticed this about his books.

30:03.140 --> 30:05.964
I mean, he's studied thousands of documents.

30:06.144 --> 30:09.449
Did you actually believe, by the way, that he'd get in to see Casey?

30:09.469 --> 30:10.671
I mean, this is not for my piece.

30:10.851 --> 30:11.812
I don't know.

30:11.872 --> 30:20.905
I mean, he may have walked in to see Casey.

30:21.105 --> 30:22.888
You know, you had conversations with

30:23.358 --> 30:25.802
with people who are in that condition.

30:25.882 --> 30:27.024
They don't mean anything.

30:27.064 --> 30:32.413
You know, they're thinking about their mother or their... They're on their way out and they're drugged.

30:34.096 --> 30:34.877
Yeah.

30:34.897 --> 30:35.458
Who cares?

30:35.478 --> 30:36.820
I mean, he's probably not enough.

30:37.081 --> 30:39.084
You know, just get out of my room, will you?

30:39.104 --> 30:39.204
Yeah.

30:39.224 --> 30:39.966
Who are you again?

30:40.026 --> 30:41.468
Exactly.

30:41.971 --> 30:43.915
And what difference does it make?

30:44.295 --> 30:49.084
It is important because I know people who really believe he lied about that.

30:49.104 --> 30:56.097
I don't think he would have lied about it, but he inflated it.

30:56.638 --> 30:58.461
He inflated it.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.809
He's very interesting.

31:02.730 --> 31:18.832
I turned down an opportunity to interview him on this book, by the way, which I never thought I'd turn down Bob Woodward, but I'm so disgusted with what his books have become recently, and I guess I really enjoyed reading your take on the whole thing.

31:19.232 --> 31:20.253
You did a very nice job.

31:20.273 --> 31:21.515
Oh, thank you.

31:21.535 --> 31:22.717
Well, I don't have to go on at length.

31:22.937 --> 31:25.140
I think there's plenty of...
