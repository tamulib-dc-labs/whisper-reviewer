WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:02.507
Okay.

00:04.349 --> 00:08.112
First of all, I interviewed you for the previous book, which I thought was wonderful.

00:08.472 --> 00:09.233
Thank you.

00:09.253 --> 00:13.757
And I got a pretty darn good interview out of that, so I've got lots of good notes.

00:14.117 --> 00:14.798
Good.

00:14.878 --> 00:19.382
So I don't think we have to replicate things that we did earlier, but I certainly am.

00:20.102 --> 00:27.929
I'm just fascinated that you did go ahead and write about the Paris years, and I wonder what motivated you to do that.

00:27.949 --> 00:28.830
I had to.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.152
I couldn't leave the reader hanging.

00:31.132 --> 00:36.901
You know, the last line in the other book was Paris After Dark.

00:36.921 --> 00:37.502
There you go.

00:38.103 --> 00:39.405
And so I had to do that.

00:40.086 --> 00:47.057
But by extension then, we leave off here in 1962, and we still have 34 years.

00:47.618 --> 00:48.900
Not going to touch it.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.341
How come?

00:50.903 --> 00:55.030
Washington does not turn me on in terms of a biography.

00:55.769 --> 00:58.292
I was an observer.

00:58.553 --> 01:04.861
I never was a participant in the Washington scene as I was in the Paris scene in my childhood.

01:05.742 --> 01:07.404
And I had no interest in it at all.

01:08.726 --> 01:12.090
So this is very definitely a story of youth and as much as anything else, isn't it?

01:12.891 --> 01:14.533
Yeah, I'm going to write a novel.

01:15.494 --> 01:16.876
Ah, good for you.

01:16.896 --> 01:18.819
A Washington novel?

01:19.279 --> 01:21.062
Nope, nope.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.924
It's going to be fairly autobiographical.

01:23.275 --> 01:23.616
Good.

01:24.357 --> 01:26.240
And I suppose that's probably all you want to tell me about it.

01:26.901 --> 01:27.882
Yeah, for the moment.

01:28.062 --> 01:28.804
I respect that.

01:29.505 --> 01:29.605
Yeah.

01:29.625 --> 01:29.885
I do.

01:31.167 --> 01:35.314
I think nothing sounds more foolish than an idea for a book.

01:36.596 --> 01:42.104
And why, you know, you've got to put it on the... You write with a computer, right?

01:42.565 --> 01:44.047
Yeah.

01:44.067 --> 01:46.471
How about writing at length like this or with a novel?

01:46.531 --> 01:50.518
Do you think that... Are you going to do that with a computer as well?

01:50.718 --> 01:50.818
Yeah.

01:50.798 --> 01:54.101
The computer is the answer because you don't have to rewrite.

01:54.121 --> 01:58.245
You only have one draft and you just keep touching up the draft.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.308
So I like a computer.

02:01.428 --> 02:02.949
So it is a polished work for you.

02:03.470 --> 02:04.111
Yeah.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.813
What software do you use, just out of curiosity?

02:07.093 --> 02:17.363
I use Professional Write, which is a very old one, but the reason I use it is because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles on it.

02:17.765 --> 02:25.243
I used Word for a while, but I kept making mistakes, and PWP, all it does is

02:25.831 --> 02:27.173
Word process.

02:27.854 --> 02:28.915
So that's what you use still?

02:29.737 --> 02:31.379
The professional write, that's what you use?

02:32.060 --> 02:32.200
Yeah.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.705
Yeah, that's, you know, that's cut and paste, and that's what more do you need.

02:36.446 --> 02:37.668
And it's got a spelling checker.

02:38.389 --> 02:46.861
I'm curious, let's say when you went over, when you get on that ship and you left New York in 1948, what if you'd gone to London?

02:46.901 --> 02:50.927
Would it be, let's say there was a London Herald trip?

02:50.907 --> 02:51.508
Say again?

02:51.528 --> 02:53.190
There's only one path.

02:53.210 --> 02:53.390
Yeah.

02:53.410 --> 02:53.931
I couldn't go.

02:53.991 --> 02:56.334
I could have gone to Venice.

02:56.354 --> 02:57.215
I could have gone alone.

02:58.797 --> 03:04.264
No, Paris is... Paris is... It's in the mind.

03:04.404 --> 03:07.288
It's more than just a city.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.591
It's a way of life.

03:09.611 --> 03:10.172
It's romance.

03:10.632 --> 03:14.237
And apparently it still exercises the same magic on you when you go back.

03:15.599 --> 03:15.799
Me?

03:16.039 --> 03:16.300
Yeah.

03:16.640 --> 03:16.880
No.

03:17.041 --> 03:17.481
Not really?

03:17.521 --> 03:19.684
No, because all my buddies are gone.

03:20.285 --> 03:20.425
Uh-huh.

03:20.894 --> 03:28.243
The period you read about there were all pals and nostalgic and everything.

03:28.263 --> 03:29.805
Now I go back, I don't know anybody.

03:30.305 --> 03:41.979
But that's why I'm wondering, you know, if being a young man of 22 and you went over there, maybe it had a lot to do with youth as well as the soul of the city.

03:42.340 --> 03:48.387
Maybe, but I hit a very unbelievable period.

03:49.447 --> 03:50.268
because it was cheap.

03:50.889 --> 03:51.129
Uh-huh.

03:51.830 --> 03:55.394
And so we could all live there very cheap and live well.

03:56.395 --> 04:09.091
But I'll tell you, if I was a 22-year-old man today and went over, I'd probably have a wonderful time, and I'd meet people that I'd grow up with eventually, too.

04:09.611 --> 04:12.395
It's just that the people I grew up with, they'd go on there.

04:12.915 --> 04:16.720
A lot of them are in heaven.

04:18.050 --> 04:23.242
I'm not going to ask you too many things about what's in the book, obviously.

04:24.544 --> 04:28.032
Quite obviously, it speaks for yourself.

04:28.052 --> 04:35.569
But I am taken by this little comment towards the very end of the book when you say you've had your share of ups and downs.

04:35.549 --> 04:39.374
But what you find interesting is that most of your ups have been connected to your downs.

04:39.695 --> 04:41.297
Yeah.

04:41.538 --> 04:42.439
That's fascinating.

04:42.499 --> 04:48.708
And of course, here you are acknowledged as one of the great humorists of your time.

04:48.728 --> 04:53.635
I almost feel that you have to have the downs to really appreciate, to have a sense of humor.

04:53.935 --> 05:00.865
Well, I illustrated the downs in the book, but being in an orphanage and being a foster child and

05:01.925 --> 05:09.835
having a tough time, in a sense, in the Marine Corps, and not getting a college degree.

05:10.976 --> 05:21.129
And they were all downs, but they turned into ups, because in every case, somebody came along and said, Oh, would you like to speak at our graduation?

05:23.092 --> 05:26.616
Oh, the Marine Corps would be honored if you would talk to them.

05:27.137 --> 05:28.719
So that's what I meant by that.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.122
I understand.

05:31.810 --> 05:33.272
I was kind of amused.

05:33.312 --> 05:37.857
I didn't know until this book that you never picked up French in all those years.

05:38.518 --> 05:41.522
I can speak it, but not to any degree.

05:41.542 --> 05:41.742
Yeah.

05:42.563 --> 05:46.407
And I love that story of being a, that VA story is just wonderful.

05:47.428 --> 05:52.494
The one about the VA money that you were supposed to be getting, and you bribed a woman.

05:52.515 --> 05:55.218
Now, did your buddy actually paint the portraits of those two kids?

05:55.698 --> 05:57.160
I think he had to.

06:00.008 --> 06:07.098
He went on to be not a great painter, but Rockefeller had a couple of his paintings.

06:07.118 --> 06:09.401
Yeah, and he probably made a living out of it, right?

06:10.563 --> 06:11.244
What a shame.

06:11.324 --> 06:12.486
What a disgrace.

06:12.766 --> 06:15.149
This guy was really a VA guy.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.513
He was mean.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.976
Well, I was in the Navy myself.

06:20.076 --> 06:21.418
You know, it's funny.

06:21.438 --> 06:22.320
You're talking to me.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.082
I was working while you were talking to me.

06:24.683 --> 06:28.328
I'm going to speak at the 75th anniversary of the Council of Foreign Relations.

06:29.017 --> 06:31.080
in about three weeks.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.546
And I was writing about all of us.

06:34.586 --> 06:38.493
We were a bunch of bums, you know, near the wells.

06:39.474 --> 06:49.371
And the ones who could manage to get into the marshal plant, as mailroom boys and as clerks, wound up telling, running the

06:49.705 --> 06:59.702
the coal and steel industry for the Benelux country, telling the French how to make cheese.

06:59.723 --> 07:00.624
That's funny.

07:00.644 --> 07:08.959
You've got over 30 books, I guess, to your credit, but the last book you said to me was pretty much the first actual book that you'd done.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.363
And was there any anxiety?

07:11.463 --> 07:14.869
I mean, did you feel in approaching this?

07:15.794 --> 07:16.776
Yeah, about writing it?

07:16.796 --> 07:17.517
Home or this one?

07:18.198 --> 07:21.162
Well, both, actually, because this one you had to follow up on a triumph.

07:21.182 --> 07:25.950
I feel about this, and I'm being very honest about it.

07:25.970 --> 07:28.053
People don't take humorists seriously.

07:28.954 --> 07:31.218
They don't even call them writers, they call them humorists.

07:32.179 --> 07:33.962
Those two books made me a writer.

07:34.943 --> 07:37.668
Be viewed in terms of people like you calling me.

07:38.469 --> 07:43.877
And that gives me great pleasure because I like to be known as a writer instead of a humorist.

07:44.498 --> 07:48.105
It's like one step up.

07:48.125 --> 08:00.948
And leaving home, the reaction was very good because I touched a lot of buttons with depression and orphanages and all the different things.

08:01.108 --> 08:07.620
And that gave me great pleasure because I really, I heard from an awful lot of people in varied parts of my life.

08:08.225 --> 08:11.149
not talking about me, but talking about themselves.

08:12.171 --> 08:24.488
The second book, and we don't know what will happen with it, is full of nostalgia about a period that to us now was one of the great global periods of all time.

08:25.169 --> 08:31.898
If people are interested in reading about this and reading about our lives, I'll feel real good about it.

08:31.918 --> 08:36.645
But I can't tell people what to read, and nobody knows what works and what doesn't.

08:38.043 --> 08:47.855
But clearly you said where... I don't know necessarily if I would subscribe to that where I would not call you a writer.

08:47.915 --> 08:49.256
I would call you a humorist.

08:49.377 --> 08:53.161
I would personally consider you a writer, you know, all these years.

08:53.301 --> 08:57.827
But there must be a great deal of satisfaction for you there in that regard.

08:57.847 --> 08:58.648
In what?

08:58.668 --> 09:02.372
Well, you say that now people are calling you a writer.

09:03.874 --> 09:04.074
Yeah.

09:04.895 --> 09:07.138
And that you have... I'm sort of...

09:08.165 --> 09:09.988
I'm in those September years.

09:11.389 --> 09:17.918
And I think, like people doing their September years, how am I going to be remembered?

09:19.541 --> 09:24.708
And I'd love to be remembered based on these books and what I'm writing now.

09:25.349 --> 09:25.609
Really?

09:27.472 --> 09:29.815
You know, I mean, we're both a couple of newspaper men.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.158
You've got a few more years at the business than I have.

09:32.498 --> 09:37.986
Well, if it hadn't been for the newspaper training, I don't think I'd be able to write as fast as I do.

09:38.219 --> 09:39.902
And on deadline, no less, too.

09:40.382 --> 09:45.110
I've never been... I told people, you know, people said, you can get writer's block.

09:45.130 --> 09:50.940
I said, no editor would allow me to get writer's block.

09:51.000 --> 09:51.861
That's right.

09:51.881 --> 09:53.303
Writer's block is an indulgence.

09:53.544 --> 09:54.565
Were you on the Herald Tribunal?

09:54.585 --> 09:55.006
Say again?

09:55.387 --> 09:56.509
Were you on the Herald Tribunal?

09:56.529 --> 09:59.654
No, no, I'm... That came a little before.

09:59.694 --> 10:01.797
I'm 53, and I...

10:01.777 --> 10:02.721
years old.

10:02.761 --> 10:03.463
No, I'm not.

10:03.483 --> 10:04.748
But you remember we had a chat.

10:05.109 --> 10:07.318
I did an interview with you up here in Boston.

10:07.358 --> 10:08.964
You knew Dick Steele very well.

10:09.024 --> 10:10.369
Yeah, that's right.

10:10.923 --> 10:13.987
And what I've done is basically syndicated myself.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.248
I heard that.

10:15.268 --> 10:17.611
And I'm in 25 papers now.

10:18.372 --> 10:18.492
Great.

10:18.512 --> 10:24.299
And good ones, you know, Wichita, Salt Lake City, Columbus, Austin, a lot of Southerns.

10:24.539 --> 10:26.502
Always books or anything you want?

10:26.522 --> 10:28.184
Well, it's usually a book feature.

10:29.485 --> 10:29.665
Yeah.

10:29.806 --> 10:34.792
And, of course, I also read the books, which is something that they don't normally get, you know.

10:35.092 --> 10:35.192
Yeah.

10:35.172 --> 10:41.661
And I really enjoyed that, leaving home so much.

10:42.162 --> 10:42.722
I really did.

10:42.882 --> 10:57.302
Because, you know, people have a perception of a humorist as always being funny and always, you know, and not having a... It comes around more and more now because I talk about my depression.

10:57.322 --> 11:00.366
I talked about Unmarried King with Mike Wallace.

11:01.308 --> 11:03.370
And the reaction on that was bigger than anything.

11:03.711 --> 11:04.572
I should think.

11:05.227 --> 11:09.253
And so, don't be worried about it.

11:09.273 --> 11:17.925
I take great pleasure in the fact that this stage, if I had it, and I can tell people I had it, and it helps them, that's great.

11:17.945 --> 11:31.183
Yeah, and isn't it coincidental that your neighbor down there on the island, Bill Styron, also had a... Well, Mike and I, the three of us are here, and we all blame it on the water and Styron's water.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.292
Now, is Mike in Vineyard Haven too?

11:34.332 --> 11:34.913
Yeah.

11:34.933 --> 11:37.776
So all three of you guys are, geez, that's amazing.

11:38.256 --> 11:39.418
It's a beautiful day today.

11:39.438 --> 11:40.499
Yeah.

11:40.639 --> 11:41.820
Are you on the island?

11:42.241 --> 11:46.265
No, actually, I'm actually coming down later, but later in the week.

11:46.926 --> 11:49.689
I'm here in the morning in case you need to ask a question.

11:49.709 --> 11:49.809
Okay.

11:49.829 --> 11:52.592
Really, this, I really don't need a lot of your time.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.275
We did that other interview, and it would be silly.

11:55.295 --> 11:56.677
You want me to copy?

11:57.237 --> 11:57.978
Oh, I'd love to.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.681
Want me to send it there on the island or in Washington?

12:00.661 --> 12:03.183
2000, Pennsylvania, I went here.

12:03.204 --> 12:04.495
2000...

12:06.213 --> 12:08.395
Pennsylvania Avenue.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.897
Say again, the zip?

12:11.058 --> 12:13.360
Two zero zero zero six.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.562
Okay, and I'll let you know what papers it runs in, too.

12:16.062 --> 12:16.162
Okay.

12:16.182 --> 12:19.526
And one reason I wanted to do this early is I can get the jump on everybody.

12:20.066 --> 12:20.747
That's good.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.990
I can move this up, and I'll get it in maybe 30, 35 papers.

12:24.210 --> 12:28.054
Judy has some good photographs if you want to send a photograph with me.

12:28.074 --> 12:28.654
I already got them.

12:28.995 --> 12:29.435
Okay.

12:29.575 --> 12:30.876
I got 25 pictures.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.600
Now, if you don't mind my using some of the quotes from the earlier interview.

12:34.580 --> 12:35.645
No problem.

12:35.665 --> 12:35.987
Okay.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.940
That way, because, I mean, you'd say the same thing this time, right?
