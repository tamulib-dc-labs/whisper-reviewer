00:02.427 --> 00:08.795
You said my wife is from Worcester.

00:09.636 --> 00:10.918
For the local readers, perhaps.

00:10.938 --> 00:13.841
She lived across the street from Clark University.

00:14.903 --> 00:17.826
I can't remember the area.

00:17.907 --> 00:20.129
Hey, Peter.

00:20.910 --> 00:21.952
How are you, pal?

00:21.972 --> 00:22.733
Great.

00:22.753 --> 00:23.714
What are your plans, my friend?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.777
Well, I'm here.

00:25.797 --> 00:30.122
See how we do for the weekend.

00:30.473 --> 00:35.158
I'm doing a little—this is Peter Lyons, this gentleman then.

00:35.219 --> 00:37.161
He's from the Worcester Telegram.

00:37.341 --> 00:37.802
Hi, Nick.

00:38.162 --> 00:39.604
Nice to meet you.

00:40.325 --> 00:41.266
You can take a look at that.

00:41.326 --> 00:44.169
Step outside while we talk here.

00:44.189 --> 00:46.352
You're going to pick me up and drive me down the cave, huh?

00:46.532 --> 00:47.233
Yeah.

00:47.253 --> 00:48.214
That's all I want to know.

00:48.254 --> 00:48.854
What time?

00:49.435 --> 00:52.779
Well, we're going on the Peter Meade show.

00:52.799 --> 00:54.221
What time?

00:54.241 --> 00:56.143
For half an hour of your time at most.

00:56.461 --> 01:03.233
I just thought it would be nice for the local readers if you did mention that your wife is from Worcester, but you went to school with her, I read in the book.

01:03.253 --> 01:04.956
Yeah, we went to high school together.

01:06.258 --> 01:12.850
Her father was a Worcester fellow, all of her grandmother and grandfather, and they came from Worcester.

01:13.572 --> 01:16.555
As a matter of fact, after we had married, I remember visiting.

01:17.676 --> 01:19.498
You don't have three hours, just so you know.

01:19.859 --> 01:20.660
No way.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.041
No way.

01:22.121 --> 01:23.903
We're going to be out of there by seven o'clock.

01:23.963 --> 01:25.084
That's exactly right.

01:25.104 --> 01:25.345
All right.

01:25.565 --> 01:31.111
That's exactly right.

01:31.131 --> 01:33.974
And Millie's name was Miller.

01:34.154 --> 01:39.020
And yeah, she lived a really life in Worcester.

01:39.220 --> 01:42.263
Can you tell me your dad's name?

01:42.428 --> 01:45.312
Because I'll look it up, and it'll be nice.

01:45.332 --> 01:58.209
Her father was Harlow Miller, and her grandfather, her grandfather actually, I guess, was a Methodist minister out, and what's the next town outside there?

01:58.229 --> 02:00.132
Grafton, Shrewsbury.

02:00.172 --> 02:02.154
The other way.

02:02.335 --> 02:09.184
Holden, Milbury, Sutton, Stowe, Spencer.

02:10.285 --> 02:12.368
Spencer, that's where it was, Spencer.

02:12.770 --> 02:16.176
And her father was born in Spencer, and they moved to Worcester.

02:16.577 --> 02:17.679
Good local angle.

02:17.699 --> 02:20.644
Oh yeah, the old Worcester town.

02:20.664 --> 02:22.708
But I'm very friendly with them.

02:22.728 --> 02:25.393
The Yatags up there, and Joe Colleen was my pal.

02:26.074 --> 02:29.260
There's so many people down the Cape that I'm friendly with now.

02:29.662 --> 02:32.085
There's a good Worcester crowd down there.

02:32.105 --> 02:32.826
Big Worcester.

02:32.846 --> 02:38.292
I'm from Lowell originally myself, but just a lot of Greeks up there, which explains my background.

02:38.713 --> 02:39.774
I love this book, sir.

02:39.794 --> 02:41.476
I'm the book editor of the newspaper.

02:41.496 --> 02:43.098
You enjoyed it.

02:43.218 --> 02:44.679
You know something?

02:45.020 --> 02:50.727
We autographed yesterday at the Harvard Coupe 825 books, and we had to cut it off.

02:50.747 --> 02:51.868
We didn't have them anymore.

02:52.509 --> 02:58.015
Today we were 775 at the Laureate Bookshop, and they said, we've never had anything like this.

02:58.383 --> 03:03.611
The biggest anybody ever did was Bob Hope with 407.

03:03.671 --> 03:03.911
Wow.

03:03.931 --> 03:09.439
And they said, we shut the line off and he said, the line was as long as when we started.

03:09.499 --> 03:10.941
I can't believe it.

03:10.981 --> 03:13.966
The job I used to have trying to get people to propose to vote.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.369
It's uncommonly good.

03:16.449 --> 03:17.891
I mean, my job is book editor.

03:17.911 --> 03:19.654
I read books professionally.

03:19.714 --> 03:20.816
It's my job.

03:21.196 --> 03:23.800
Well, you know, I sat down for two hours with

03:24.117 --> 03:26.560
Well, let me give you the background.

03:26.901 --> 03:31.207
One day, about eight, seven or eight years ago now, a young fellow came in to see me.

03:31.227 --> 03:33.670
His name was Bill Novak.

03:33.690 --> 03:38.077
And he says, I'm a writer from, I live in Newton.

03:38.097 --> 03:42.943
And he said, I'm a Canadian, but I've been living down here for years.

03:43.905 --> 03:45.787
He says, I've seen you at the Red Sox game.

03:45.848 --> 03:47.330
I'm a great Red Sox fan.

03:47.370 --> 03:48.511
I'm a great Patriots fan.

03:48.531 --> 03:49.753
I'm a great Celtics buff.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.377
And I said, I've met you everywhere along the line.

03:52.397 --> 03:54.499
He said, I'd like to write your life story.

03:54.539 --> 03:57.042
I've been following you in politics since I was a kid.

03:57.942 --> 03:59.784
I said, I don't think there's any story out there, Bill.

03:59.804 --> 04:00.865
I said, by the way, what are you doing?

04:01.406 --> 04:03.788
He said, I just signed on to write an Iacocca book.

04:04.008 --> 04:08.533
I said, after you get through with the Iacocca book, come back and send it.

04:08.553 --> 04:13.738
Well, in the meantime, my son Kip said to me, Dad, a lot of people are saying you ought to put your memoirs down.

04:13.758 --> 04:15.960
You go, people, you get great recall.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.843
There isn't anybody that you can't tell a story about.

04:18.903 --> 04:20.284
You can remember things.

04:20.385 --> 04:25.771
And he said, people think you ought to get your recollections done on paper.

04:25.791 --> 04:28.014
And I said, well, I don't know.

04:28.034 --> 04:28.835
I told him.

04:28.855 --> 04:32.899
I had this young kid who wrote the Ayacocca book.

04:32.919 --> 04:34.141
Well, he said, we're going to do it.

04:34.181 --> 04:37.765
If you're going to do it, he said, you have to get an agent.

04:37.785 --> 04:44.513
And he said, the object of getting an agent is that they have to go out and find out if anybody is interested in writing your life.

04:45.809 --> 04:49.312
So he said, and they also have to get an author.

04:49.332 --> 04:52.775
Well, anyway, I talked with Jay, and we signed him up as our agent.

04:54.077 --> 05:05.788
And Jay said to me, well, now what I do now is I put an ad in the paper, trade paper, looking for a writer.

05:05.808 --> 05:07.890
400 applied to write my story.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.651
I haven't applied.

05:09.671 --> 05:10.332
Did you really?

05:10.352 --> 05:10.912
I would have.

05:10.932 --> 05:12.694
Oh, 400, he said, applied.

05:13.231 --> 05:15.513
But he said, we've weeded it down to the last ten.

05:15.533 --> 05:19.257
And I looked at him, didn't know any, but I recognized Bill Novak's name.

05:19.277 --> 05:23.162
I said, I like the kid the minute he came to my office, I said, that's the kid we ought to talk to.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.866
He seems to have captured your voice.

05:26.886 --> 05:28.127
This is your voice in here.

05:28.147 --> 05:29.809
Well, let me tell you the interesting story.

05:29.829 --> 05:35.475
So, he came in, we sat, and you had to write a synopsis of what you were going to write about.

05:35.495 --> 05:42.242
Listen, I'm not going to talk about the personal life, I'm not going to talk about the social life, I'm not going to talk about the family life of anybody.

05:42.678 --> 05:51.688
I tell the people, the political life of people, in my perspective as I have viewed them, and what I thought of them, honest, open, and candid.

05:51.708 --> 06:01.960
If they don't like it, fine, that's the way it's going to fall, but I'm not going to talk about what Jack Kennedy did, or what Bobby Kennedy did, or anything of that nature, or what Lyndon Johnson, that's not my style.

06:02.220 --> 06:06.225
Except you do offer your views of these people quite candidly.

06:06.325 --> 06:10.069
Well, just let me go along.

06:11.551 --> 06:12.512
We write the paper.

06:12.552 --> 06:16.277
They get 14 houses that want to buy the book.

06:16.297 --> 06:19.201
And at 10 o'clock on a Tuesday morning, you start the auction.

06:19.641 --> 06:22.024
4 o'clock on Tuesday night, the auction is completed.

06:22.685 --> 06:26.750
The Random House is the publisher.

06:26.770 --> 06:30.815
And Billy and I sat down, and I dictated about 200 hours to Billy.

06:30.835 --> 06:32.217
Where'd you get him?

06:32.237 --> 06:34.039
Oh, great.

06:34.059 --> 06:35.862
Thank you.

06:35.882 --> 06:37.384
I dictated about 200 hours.

06:37.444 --> 06:39.246
We did about 100 hours of research.

06:40.070 --> 06:42.213
And Billy had one of those operations.

06:43.034 --> 06:44.176
Word processor.

06:44.636 --> 06:45.477
Word processor.

06:45.497 --> 06:46.859
Word processor.

06:46.879 --> 06:48.922
And I'm being taped all the time.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.547
And Bill would say, you know, I never did see Curly.

06:52.587 --> 06:53.628
Tell me, what about Curly?

06:53.648 --> 06:55.411
Was he the guy that people say is?

06:55.431 --> 06:56.612
I learned the last hurrah.

06:56.632 --> 06:57.574
I loved him.

06:57.594 --> 06:59.857
And I'd tell him stories about Curly, you know.

07:00.558 --> 07:01.919
And he'd be typing everything down.

07:02.020 --> 07:06.786
We would have put a chapter in there with Curly that we never had intended to ever put the chapter in.

07:07.205 --> 07:09.349
I'm signing books today, and who came in?

07:09.429 --> 07:13.015
Old George Larry, who I mentioned in the book about Curly.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.058
I said, George, how old are you?

07:15.078 --> 07:16.962
He said, I'm 84 years old.

07:19.646 --> 07:22.731
And anyway, who came in today but John Cannon.

07:22.751 --> 07:27.239
I mentioned Jimmy Burke and I, Cannon used to be in charge of patronage.

07:27.259 --> 07:30.224
You had to get a letter signed by the patronage chief.

07:30.244 --> 07:31.947
We would double space our letters.

07:32.686 --> 07:36.291
and our name during the height of depression, double spacing.

07:36.371 --> 07:37.493
And I said, we'd fill it in.

07:38.074 --> 07:43.822
And John Cannon would sign it, then we'd fill it in, and we'd get 75 jobs instead of 25 jobs.

07:43.842 --> 07:45.946
And Cannon is in there to see me today.

07:46.607 --> 07:50.893
And he says, Tip, I'm living in Florida, and I happen to be up here visiting my grandchildren.

07:50.913 --> 07:53.256
They said, they were so thrilled that I'm in your book.

07:54.018 --> 07:58.624
I said, Johnny, you educated more people than any one single man in Massachusetts.

07:58.684 --> 08:00.567
He says, Tip, I'm living down in Lauderdale.

08:00.587 --> 08:02.490
I have people come up to me, grown men.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.060
Say, you sent me to college, Johnny.

08:05.080 --> 08:10.185
He was the head of patronage under Curley and then under the Democratic Party along the line.

08:10.426 --> 08:13.268
You mentioned a few Worcester people in there, Jeff Sullivan.

08:13.389 --> 08:13.869
Jeff, yeah.

08:13.889 --> 08:15.030
Jeff's an old pal of mine.

08:15.050 --> 08:16.632
Jeff was Lieutenant Governor, of course.

08:16.652 --> 08:17.893
Billy Askins, as you mentioned.

08:17.913 --> 08:18.854
Billy Askins.

08:19.014 --> 08:21.917
You see the story that I call about Billy Askins.

08:21.937 --> 08:26.482
That's an amazing thing coming through the line yesterday at the Harvard Group.

08:26.502 --> 08:31.667
A woman or a fellow, I forget which it was, he said to me, I'm a cousin of Billy Askins and I see his name in the book.

08:32.862 --> 08:35.426
But that was the story of Billy Askin's boy.

08:36.487 --> 08:42.577
You know, he was hired by the North Avenue Savings Bank to be the executive vice president.

08:42.597 --> 08:43.618
He had thrown up a job.

08:43.638 --> 08:45.621
When they found out he was a Catholic, they wouldn't hire him.

08:46.803 --> 08:48.385
And I'm talking about 1949.

08:48.485 --> 08:53.092
That stuff wasn't supposed to happen.

08:53.132 --> 08:59.562
Well, people say, you know, listen, I talk on

09:00.335 --> 09:04.540
In my lifetime, I'm on a television show this morning, and I'm talking about the newer races.

09:04.700 --> 09:05.741
What do you mean by the newer races?

09:06.522 --> 09:12.349
When I was a kid, you called a French Canadian, you called a Greek American, you called the Italian American, they were the newer races.

09:12.369 --> 09:15.132
There wasn't such a word as ethnic around in those days.

09:17.795 --> 09:19.217
How about the candor, though?

09:19.237 --> 09:21.559
I think this is what impresses me so much.

09:21.579 --> 09:23.902
I started to tell you about Bill.

09:24.383 --> 09:28.888
Bill wrote the first six chapters, and I read the first six chapters where he'd gone over and all the statements.

09:28.948 --> 09:29.869
Bill, that's not me.

09:30.642 --> 09:32.444
That's not me, that's not Tip O'Neill.

09:32.464 --> 09:38.590
I said, gee, you know, I said, you're lacking so in depth in political life and politics and government.

09:38.610 --> 09:39.912
I said, you haven't got me.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.174
Are you going to come down to Washington?

09:42.194 --> 09:51.985
So he came down to Washington, and I had him go to the caucus meetings, and I had him go to the policy committee meetings, and I had him go to the whip organization meetings, and I took him around.

09:52.866 --> 09:59.012
And then he got the flavor of the type of a person I was, and I thought he hit me to the T.

09:59.279 --> 10:00.921
You don't pull any punches.

10:01.141 --> 10:02.182
There's no malice.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.183
I think there are two things.

10:03.964 --> 10:06.647
It is very candid, but it's also not malicious.

10:06.927 --> 10:07.928
I don't want to be malicious.

10:07.948 --> 10:12.113
When you talk about Bobby Kennedy, you didn't like each other.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.274
No, listen.

10:13.674 --> 10:15.857
How many people liked me and didn't like my brother Bill?

10:16.417 --> 10:19.701
Or how many people that I liked but I didn't like so many members of the family?

10:19.721 --> 10:29.151
You know, the interesting fact, I go around the country and people think because I took Jack Kennedy's place in the Congress that I was a close advisor to the president and I get along with the family.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.896
I was frozen out, I tell it in the book.

10:31.916 --> 10:33.437
Jack never wanted me frozen out.

10:33.477 --> 10:34.979
We were good personal friends.

10:35.779 --> 10:40.504
But I always thought it was the Kenny O'Donnell, a Worcester boy, who was Bobby's pal.

10:41.064 --> 10:46.270
They froze me out of the White House, and so I can't go into my life saying, hey, what do you want me to do, tell lies?

10:46.870 --> 10:49.212
I was an advisor, I was there for this and I was there for that.

10:49.252 --> 10:52.536
I wasn't there for those things, and I think I explained it in the book.

10:52.776 --> 10:58.041
Well, even that little anecdote, and it's just about one or two paragraphs, where you mention when Mrs. Kennedy

10:58.240 --> 10:59.582
filed a absentee ballot.

11:00.143 --> 11:02.426
That's a funny story.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.529
There's only one in the district.

11:04.929 --> 11:09.356
And that's the little church down here in the West End, right on Cambridge Street.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.018
And I'm talking to Bob O'Hare the other day.

11:11.098 --> 11:12.420
Bob says, you're wrong on that.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.904
I said, Bob, don't tell me that I was wrong on that.

11:15.404 --> 11:20.532
He said, I drove the Kennedys that morning, he said, with Bill Maury to vote.

11:20.552 --> 11:21.753
And I said, I know you did.

11:21.793 --> 11:24.017
And you called me up and told me they were over there.

11:24.557 --> 11:27.201
But I said, when I get down there, they had left.

11:28.126 --> 11:30.870
And she didn't vote because her absentee vote.

11:30.890 --> 11:36.540
She was eight months pregnant, and they wanted to make sure that in case anything happened, she was in the hospital, she could vote for her husband.

11:37.141 --> 11:41.708
And she voted for Jack Kennedy for president and Eddie McLaughlin for lieutenant governor.

11:42.129 --> 11:48.679
And she didn't vote for Joe Watt for governor, and she didn't vote for Tip O'Neill for or any of the other Democrats on the ticket.

11:48.699 --> 11:49.881
And I said, I felt hurt.

11:50.249 --> 11:54.617
Because I had just come back from giving three weeks of my life to the Kennedys as an advance man.

11:54.637 --> 11:57.823
You must still feel hurt because I think it probably wouldn't have gotten in the book.

11:57.863 --> 12:04.455
But again, the decision to put something like that in the book, I guess it's call them the way they lay.

12:04.635 --> 12:06.298
I call them the way they lay, sure.

12:07.380 --> 12:10.005
Jackie's been nothing but nice to me every time I see her.

12:10.025 --> 12:13.050
She's all tipped and always give me a big hug and a squeeze and a kiss.

12:13.773 --> 12:16.516
Which is an old man from Pretty Girl, makes you feel pretty good.

12:17.577 --> 12:21.501
But the truth of the matter is, she didn't vote for me.

12:21.521 --> 12:26.646
Can you explain why the Speaker of the House for the past fifty years has been from Massachusetts to Texas?

12:26.886 --> 12:30.530
Gee, you know a fellow gave me a paper today, it's here somewhere.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.935
He said, I just wrote a thesis, he says, on Massachusetts politics.

12:35.615 --> 12:43.223
And he says, do you realize, he said, you were ten years, McCormick was nine years, Martin was four years, and he said Sam Raven was sixteen years.

12:43.591 --> 12:53.545
And if you go back far enough, Gillette in the 20s, he said on the speakership and how it reigns between those two.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.866
Well, a very interesting thing.

12:56.529 --> 13:02.377
When I was elected majority leader, John McCormick called me on the telephone.

13:02.397 --> 13:07.464
And he said, I want you to speak to Kyle Albert.

13:07.484 --> 13:11.269
And I want him to appoint Jim Wright as deputy whip.

13:12.177 --> 13:16.804
He said, Tom, you're going to be speaker, and he'll move along.

13:16.824 --> 13:21.712
And he said, we have to have the axis between Austin and Boston.

13:21.772 --> 13:30.065
He says, there was Johnson and Kennedy, there was O'Neill, there was McComick and Raven, and he said, there'll be an O'Neill and a Rice.

13:30.085 --> 13:32.188
And he said, I want you to keep that going.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.710
He said, we can work as a team.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.835
He said, our different philosophies, it gives the blend.

13:37.237 --> 13:49.287
He says, what the national scope and the national feeling of America is, the liberalism of Massachusetts, the moderatism of Texas, he says, together, he says, we make a great leadership team.

13:49.307 --> 13:50.428
And do you subscribe to that?

13:50.448 --> 13:51.489
Yeah, I really believe it.

13:52.030 --> 14:01.858
And as a matter of fact, I thought that Brian Donnelly was going to be the whip, but he went to Detroit instead.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.060
Are you sad that you were never governor?

14:04.360 --> 14:05.201
You mentioned that.

14:05.341 --> 14:06.282
No, you know.

14:06.667 --> 14:15.099
My ambition as a young staffer again at the politics, and I've been the first Speaker of the House, Democratic Speaker, was to be the governor.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.785
But I was down in Washington for a while, and I got political fever.

14:19.746 --> 14:24.333
And of course, I say there are an old friend, Sister Agatha, who was such a dear person.

14:24.353 --> 14:27.698
She said, your life is in Washington where you can do good.

14:27.718 --> 14:29.360
You get too magnanimous a heart.

14:29.540 --> 14:31.744
You have the ability to say no to people.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.266
You'd be a bad governor.

14:33.566 --> 14:34.007
Millie said,

14:34.578 --> 14:38.483
There goes my chances of being First Lady.

14:38.503 --> 14:42.088
The decision for, I'm just curious, she never lived in Washington all these years?

14:42.168 --> 14:43.891
No, she never lived there for 25 years.

14:45.312 --> 14:48.577
When I became Speaker, there's nobody left at the home.

14:48.617 --> 14:52.722
We had a 14-room house in Cambridge, which we sold last year at the end of the service.

14:53.724 --> 15:02.155
And we lived in Washington, and we lived in our home, and Cambridge was awfully expensive to keep up whenever all the children are gone.

15:02.675 --> 15:07.800
As a matter of fact, my son, Michael, and his daughter, and his wife, they babysat him alone.

15:07.900 --> 15:12.345
I think it pretty much says that you're a Massachusetts guy.

15:12.425 --> 15:16.089
None of this baloney about living in Washington.

15:16.129 --> 15:18.231
Listen, I want you to know something.

15:18.331 --> 15:22.756
I'm in Cleveland on Tuesday.

15:23.897 --> 15:30.724
I don't get through in Cleveland until about nine o'clock, and I grab a plane and come back to Boston.

15:31.362 --> 15:36.087
I'd rather be in Boston alone than in some other area with forty people around me.

15:36.107 --> 15:36.928
This is my roots.

15:36.948 --> 15:37.809
This is my life.

15:38.029 --> 15:42.934
If I'm only in Boston, I can get a night's sleep, whether I'm sleeping in my own house or a hotel.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.837
It's big in the environment of home.

15:46.978 --> 15:50.082
Have you had any feedback on the candor of the book?

15:50.182 --> 15:55.587
Has anyone said, gee, maybe you shouldn't have told that story about Mrs. Kennedy not voting for you?

15:55.667 --> 15:57.369
You know, you're the first one that's mentioned there.

15:57.930 --> 16:01.133
Not another soul has met.

16:01.619 --> 16:05.324
Oh, well, I'll mention a prominent reporter of the Boston Globe.

16:05.344 --> 16:06.766
You're too easy on the Kennedys.

16:06.806 --> 16:07.487
You should have been.

16:08.249 --> 16:08.749
Hey, listen.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.652
You know, what do you mean, too easy?

16:11.213 --> 16:12.455
Well, you knew Jack.

16:12.495 --> 16:13.696
Don't talk to me like that.

16:13.736 --> 16:15.839
I don't know about the first life of anybody.

16:16.821 --> 16:17.722
Don't talk to me like that.

16:17.742 --> 16:24.292
And then I've had people, a couple of people coming through, signing, and saying, I think you've been a little rough on the president.

16:24.312 --> 16:31.542
But on a basis of five to one, they say, you know, Tip, you should have given it to the president with both hands instead of one.

16:32.028 --> 16:34.531
So, you know, satisfied people out there.

16:35.232 --> 16:45.544
But I was the only man in America for ten years that had a daily press conference every day, the house was in session.

16:45.564 --> 16:47.606
Meet with the television, radio in the morning.

16:48.307 --> 16:54.054
Then the cop asked eleven, quarter, twelve, meet with the media, you know, the news people.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.596
Covered all the newspapers.

16:56.177 --> 16:58.800
I had to draw a hundred and a hundred and fifty.

16:58.820 --> 17:01.663
And I'd once in a while have an open

17:02.200 --> 17:09.188
have a statement that I'd read, and then I would articulate and dialogue with them, conversations.

17:10.270 --> 17:15.876
I used to pack them in every day, and I'd get along with all of them, because I was honest and candid.

17:16.837 --> 17:17.959
I never missed any of this.

17:17.979 --> 17:20.041
You know, let me tell you something.

17:20.141 --> 17:23.145
Sam Raven once said, tell the truth.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.481
And he says, tell it as you know it and tell it as you see it.

17:26.541 --> 17:30.066
And he says, the next time it comes around, he says, you're going to tell the same story.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.288
He says, don't lie along the line.

17:32.328 --> 17:35.392
Wasn't it also Rayburn who said, if you want to get along, go along?

17:35.573 --> 17:36.674
Rayburn said, get along.

17:36.694 --> 17:37.955
If you want to get along, go along.

17:37.976 --> 17:45.905
But one of the things that he really did say that was a tremendous factor in my life, I never had a press secretary until I became Speaker of the House.

17:48.188 --> 17:53.655
I never had, I never sent out a news release in my life until I became Speaker of the House and

17:54.226 --> 17:55.187
That's a different thing.

17:56.389 --> 17:58.411
I never looked for credit for anything.

17:58.531 --> 18:01.675
I saw stories of people taking credit for this one coming in.

18:02.516 --> 18:14.550
I was always a back room operator, knowing how to get things done, knowing how to win amendments and knowing how to put things in legislation behind the scenes.

18:14.570 --> 18:18.375
I know how to put things in the budget and things like that.

18:18.395 --> 18:22.900
And I was telling a story in one of the presses this morning.

18:23.656 --> 18:30.085
Eddie Bowen came back from down in North Carolina, the Hatteras National Park.

18:30.105 --> 18:31.507
What a beautiful national park.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.690
I had just come back from Falmouth.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.753
The Cape was going honky-tonk.

18:35.773 --> 18:41.001
Together we put a bill together for the Cape Cod National Park.

18:41.021 --> 18:42.263
Saltonstall opposed it.

18:42.343 --> 18:43.384
Kennedy opposed it.

18:43.404 --> 18:46.929
It eventually goes through as the Saltonstall-Kennedy Park.

18:46.949 --> 18:48.512
Eddie and I did all the work on that.

18:49.112 --> 18:50.895
I think that I looked back and I said, gee...

18:51.652 --> 18:59.242
700 and some odd miles of coastline, only 29 miles of open beach for the people, and we build a beach 55 miles long.

18:59.263 --> 19:05.631
Sam Rapin says, when you're interested in something and you're able to accomplish it, there's a satisfaction from within.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.716
If somebody else gets their headline, don't let it bother you.

19:09.637 --> 19:12.681
And I went through all things of that nature.

19:13.049 --> 19:19.355
Well, what do you think a lot of these purported good government people would say, if you want to get along, go along to that?

19:19.375 --> 19:22.118
I mean, politics is politics.

19:22.699 --> 19:24.260
Well, politics has changed.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.563
The ethics of politics has changed.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.426
You couldn't do the things that I say in the book that Sam Rabin used to do today.

19:30.827 --> 19:35.932
Hell, I wouldn't call the intent of revenue for my mother or myself, let alone some member of the Congress.

19:35.952 --> 19:37.674
So politics has changed.

19:37.714 --> 19:38.955
The style has changed.

19:39.745 --> 19:43.830
I'm the last, I guess, of the lunch pocket.

19:43.910 --> 19:46.274
Did you like it better the old way?

19:46.874 --> 19:50.099
Well, you know, people say, how did you ever move?

19:51.280 --> 19:54.985
There's an old story, an old statement, I've used it many times.

19:55.906 --> 20:07.221
You know, you're the old Curly Vintage, you're the old Paul Dever Vintage, you're the old Roosevelt type of a Democrat, you're the old Bretton Butter Liberal, working wages liberal, dinner pay liberal.

20:07.403 --> 20:10.067
You'll fight for the family and increase it.

20:12.330 --> 20:15.775
The half at home, keep it burning, more education and things like that.

20:16.396 --> 20:17.498
The new group came along.

20:18.179 --> 20:22.505
You know, the environmental, the Save the Whales group, things of that nature.

20:22.525 --> 20:26.651
The truth of the matter is that the style of politics changed.

20:27.292 --> 20:30.257
And I kept one foot in one bucket and one foot in the other bucket.

20:31.378 --> 20:35.925
And an old dog can learn new tricks if he wants to learn new tricks.

20:36.479 --> 20:44.889
So as they came along, I stayed atop of all of the new things, but never forgetting from where I came and never forgetting the basics of which I believed in.

20:44.949 --> 20:47.772
What do you personally consider your greatest accomplishment?

20:47.792 --> 20:52.517
That's hard to start, just to say.

20:53.779 --> 20:59.445
I know what historians tell me and people that have followed me up now.

21:00.126 --> 21:03.870
There was a turn in my life when I opposed as the

21:04.711 --> 21:18.083
As a loyal Democrat of the establishment, I opposed Johnson in the war, and that I was a key factor in the Congress in turning the Congress around with regards to that war.

21:18.103 --> 21:30.735
One of my great falsehoods, when Johnson said to me, you've got a following in the House that I hope you won't go to the questionnaires, and I didn't for probably a period of the year, which I'd say in my lifetime, I did the wrong thing.

21:31.235 --> 21:34.498
But then I came out openly against the war in 1967.

21:35.018 --> 21:38.443
And I was a real continent.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.645
I think I did the right thing.

21:39.785 --> 21:41.928
I think it was an accomplishment.

21:41.948 --> 21:48.097
So you say it's difficult to say what gives you the greatest satisfaction, but that would rank up.

21:48.197 --> 22:00.115
When they tell me two million people who go to Cape Cod for the summer and for the beach, this campus down there and all that, I get a kick out of it.

22:00.517 --> 22:03.420
The Minuteman National Park, I know I played a part of it.

22:03.460 --> 22:13.431
When I look at the development of Boston here, I know in the last ten years the Speaker of the House, if I could call a chairman, it would be then.

22:13.471 --> 22:19.036
But I know that I played a part in the enhancement of the economy last year, and I'm proud of it.

22:19.337 --> 22:20.738
You make that point in the book, too.

22:20.758 --> 22:29.207
Now, you're the Speaker of the House, very close to the number one job, yet you always remember the district.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.060
Well, all politics are local.

22:31.121 --> 22:39.715
Once you forget where you came from, you're going to get a rude awakening, and that's why they're surprised along the line.

22:39.835 --> 22:43.461
I put so much in the budget from the U.S.

22:43.481 --> 22:47.047
I'm one of the great spenders of all time, they say.

22:47.267 --> 22:48.830
How do you react to that?

22:49.090 --> 22:56.342
One day, I put $160 million in the federal budget for cancer, for the study of cancer.

22:56.710 --> 23:05.141
And in one day, I increased the budget behind the scenes in the committee, $45 million for a study on women's breast cancer.

23:06.122 --> 23:07.184
I can multiply that.

23:07.244 --> 23:12.311
I put $50 million in another day for turned-in ankles and knocked knees.

23:12.891 --> 23:17.317
Seven out of every ten children that used to be born either had turned-in ankles and knocked knees.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.360
Now, who's going to make a study on that?

23:19.400 --> 23:21.222
Who's going to say you correct your diet?

23:21.643 --> 23:23.806
Who's going to say that you put braces in there?

23:23.826 --> 23:26.329
Nobody's going to make a study on that unless Uncle Sam

23:26.579 --> 23:32.265
has a project out there and is paying young interns to be specialists in that field.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.167
And I put seventy-odd million dollars in.

23:34.187 --> 23:40.374
You know, the interesting thing, one of my own grandchildren were born with turned in ankles and turned in toes.

23:40.394 --> 23:43.458
Within a matter of three months after she was born, she was cured.

23:44.218 --> 23:44.919
She was cured.

23:45.700 --> 23:52.047
And I don't know, I'm going to put forty million in or something like that for the study of dwarfs.

23:53.191 --> 23:54.613
It's unbelievable.

23:54.713 --> 23:57.116
The average dwarf grew the age of 26 inches.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.279
Who's going to study dwarfs?

23:59.319 --> 24:01.421
8,000 of them are born in America a year.

24:02.402 --> 24:05.026
There are only about 160,000 of them in the country.

24:05.927 --> 24:07.729
And yet we now have a process.

24:07.829 --> 24:21.426
When they find that a child is a dwarf before it's a year and a half, by certain vitamins, by cutting certain tendons, by stretch bodies, they can now grow a dwarf if they find that he's a dwarf before the year and a half.

24:21.777 --> 24:23.920
They can bring them up to 48 or 50 inches.

24:24.201 --> 24:25.884
And these are all people programs.

24:25.904 --> 24:26.965
These are all people programs.

24:26.985 --> 24:28.869
Nobody ever got any headlines on that one.

24:29.369 --> 24:34.017
The Wall Street Journal knocked my brains out because I had put the money in them for that budget.

24:34.037 --> 24:37.202
They said we'd be better off buying Cuban hills for them.

24:37.222 --> 24:40.568
But, you know, we don't do enough in the field of research.

24:41.289 --> 24:45.135
People say, are there any problems that you wish they had moved on before you left?

24:45.605 --> 24:47.808
My next question is a matter of fact.

24:47.828 --> 24:49.009
Well, there's so many of them up.

24:49.069 --> 24:50.211
Well, let me tell you one.

24:50.231 --> 24:54.616
There are 2,200,000 people over the age of 85 in America right there.

24:55.437 --> 25:00.843
By the year 2000, there's going to be 6 million Americans over the age of 85.

25:00.863 --> 25:05.269
92% of them have only one income, Social Security.

25:05.289 --> 25:06.049
That's a problem.

25:06.110 --> 25:07.852
They can't get by on Social Security.

25:08.392 --> 25:09.694
We're living older all the time.

25:09.754 --> 25:14.059
That's an obligation of the federal government, and we've got to prepare and get ready for it.

25:14.596 --> 25:18.343
But there's lots of things of that nature out there.

25:18.483 --> 25:24.414
I was talking to the group of young fellows that I meet with all members of Congress, and I said, you know, this is a serious problem.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.820
It's about time the old age committee started to look at that.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.202
Well, we are looking at it.

25:29.222 --> 25:31.667
Well, it's going to be down the road quicker than you think.

25:31.687 --> 25:35.153
I had a study on water.

25:36.213 --> 25:39.477
We thought energy was a crisis 25, 30 years from now.

25:39.558 --> 25:40.879
Water is going to be a crisis.

25:40.899 --> 25:41.760
Down in the Cape, too.

25:42.241 --> 25:42.542
Sure.

25:42.662 --> 25:45.946
It's going to be all around America.

25:45.986 --> 25:55.559
And I said, you know, Carter was wrong when he said, you know, pork barrel.

25:56.180 --> 26:01.167
America needs these dams all over the country because there's going to be a water shortage.

26:01.187 --> 26:02.929
I'm just going to turn this on the other side, sir.
