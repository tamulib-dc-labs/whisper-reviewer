WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:09.362
Testing, one, two, three, four, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, testing, testing site.

00:11.424 --> 00:19.094
And when I talk about that, and so you, you were a editor here for a bit of biography, if you don't mind.

00:20.496 --> 00:25.222
Well, I was an editor for, or in the editorial department for 29 years.

00:26.383 --> 00:26.463
Wow.

00:26.483 --> 00:27.084
Wow, that's right.

00:27.525 --> 00:30.308
And, uh... Well, that covered some really, very,

00:31.199 --> 00:34.442
It covers the growth of the press, really.

00:35.883 --> 00:39.307
And, uh, I don't know how much you want to know.

00:39.347 --> 00:54.942
I started out as an editor, and my fields are political science, economics, and law, and Chester, her at that moment, was looking for someone in political science for what was going to be a science, I think, and I wandered in the door.

00:54.982 --> 00:58.405
So, I was hired, and, uh,

00:59.195 --> 01:10.050
I started out in this building next to this one on the corner there, and I was there for about a couple months, and then we moved over to York Street.

01:11.833 --> 01:26.113
And at last I became, I don't remember the title, something like managing editor or something like that after a while, but I kept on doing my editorial work.

01:26.853 --> 01:37.447
And then I decided, well, I don't know how much you really want to know, but I wondered how far... As much as you care to tell me, really.

01:37.928 --> 01:41.653
I wondered how far a woman could go, and I was interested... That's very important.

01:41.673 --> 01:41.813
Pardon?

01:41.833 --> 01:43.315
That's very important to me, by the way.

01:43.335 --> 01:54.430
Oh, well, I was interested, and Chester got along very well with his women editors, but I did, at that point, have an administrative job, and I asked what my chances were.

01:54.899 --> 01:56.641
becoming an assistant at it.

01:56.721 --> 01:58.002
This is about what year?

01:58.763 --> 02:03.348
Ooh, maybe 1970.

02:03.808 --> 02:05.630
I really have to guess.

02:07.592 --> 02:11.857
Well, if you were here for 29 years and you were going for 17, so it's 30.

02:11.877 --> 02:17.403
Yeah, I came in 59, so maybe it was in the 60s.

02:18.584 --> 02:19.565
But you started in 59.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.447
I started in 59.

02:22.405 --> 02:31.178
And I observed when I went to meetings of the university presses that in many cases the head of the editorial department was an assistant director.

02:31.338 --> 02:33.882
So I thought, well, I think I'd like to be assistant director.

02:34.442 --> 02:37.086
So I asked Chester what my chances were.

02:37.106 --> 02:40.451
And you've been here about ten years to that point.

02:40.852 --> 02:42.875
Oh, quite a while, yes, easily.

02:43.556 --> 02:46.840
And so I got the message that my chances were like nil.

02:47.902 --> 02:49.324
And why was that, do you think?

02:49.844 --> 02:52.167
Oh, I didn't ask, and he didn't say.

02:52.187 --> 02:53.108
I don't know.

02:54.109 --> 02:56.893
I really don't know.

02:56.933 --> 03:04.422
This is 1970, so we are becoming aware of women's... Oh, yes, and he was in general.

03:06.685 --> 03:17.419
He got along with women editors and with women in all positions, and we never felt any discrimination, really, or I didn't.

03:17.439 --> 03:18.400
With Pace comparable?

03:19.207 --> 03:22.751
I guess not quite.

03:23.973 --> 03:40.552
Not far from being comparable, but I know as far as the editors were concerned, the men, if a man came, was hired, he was likely to be hired at a higher salary than a woman.

03:40.592 --> 03:49.062
When I came to the press, I came from New York, and Chester said, well, you know, our salaries are not as high in New Haven as they are in New York, so I took a cut.

03:49.767 --> 03:58.198
But I observed that several later, when a male editor came from New York, we had to match the New York salary.

03:59.039 --> 04:06.949
So at any rate, I decided if my future was not going to lead in that direction, I would just as soon concentrate on editing.

04:06.969 --> 04:09.312
So I went back to doing editing only.

04:09.752 --> 04:17.682
And then years later, when we were in this building, I felt we had a

04:18.522 --> 04:20.445
You've heard of Ed Tripp, perhaps?

04:21.306 --> 04:21.947
I have, yes.

04:21.967 --> 04:25.892
Edward Tripp, a wonderful person.

04:27.995 --> 04:41.433
A wonderful person, but not really an administrator, and it was clear that somebody was needed who would kind of pull things together, and so I volunteered to do that, and I had the title of executive editor after that.

04:41.453 --> 04:43.677
But I continued doing my books.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.239
So you were the executive editor?

04:45.259 --> 04:47.702
At the time I retired, I was executive editor.

04:49.454 --> 04:52.138
And tell me a bit about that position, what it entailed.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.702
Did you more or less get your pick-up projects to work on?

04:54.842 --> 04:55.103
No.

04:55.163 --> 05:02.855
Well, you see, we wereâ€”I don't think it's true today, but at that time, we were pretty well divided up according to fields.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.479
I mean, mine were political science, economics, and law.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.186
And those were the books that I did, and I was responsible for building up those lists.

05:12.049 --> 05:16.997
And another editor was responsible for English lit and anthropology,

05:18.935 --> 05:21.638
And languages, she did our language books.

05:21.838 --> 05:22.999
So she handled those.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.043
And so we didn't reach for projects, really.

05:27.063 --> 05:29.345
Things didn't come in that were unassigned.

05:30.487 --> 05:35.171
And so I handled my own books.

05:35.191 --> 05:37.293
But nothing came over the transcend, so to speak?

05:37.433 --> 05:42.599
Well, it was usually pretty clear whose book it was.

05:43.159 --> 05:48.064
Or if not, I'd see whether anybody was particularly interested.

05:48.618 --> 06:07.448
But, so, the other thing I was interested in was, well, when I first came to the press, we didn't consider the cost or the potential market or what we would make from the book.

06:08.109 --> 06:08.550
You didn't?

06:08.710 --> 06:09.111
We didn't.

06:09.652 --> 06:15.942
And I can remember Chester Kerr standing in my office and saying, as long as I am director of the press, we will not

06:16.546 --> 06:21.733
take into account the potential sales of the manuscript before taking it on.

06:21.753 --> 06:24.397
Well, this was in good old days.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.478
Well, this is important.

06:25.698 --> 06:32.648
I think this is one of the reasons why a change in that perception has... He changed, eventually.

06:33.369 --> 06:42.621
And another editor and I observed at a university press meeting that Princeton was very good at estimating in advance

06:43.073 --> 06:46.396
a number of copies they would sell, how many they would print and all.

06:46.416 --> 06:58.187
So we made up a little form, and it was when I showed that to Chester that he said, uh, we are not going to, uh, he didn't say crass, but, uh, that was the meanings.

06:58.388 --> 07:10.279
But, uh, some years later, I guess, not too long, when the press was having financial difficulties, why we've all that out again, and that time he looked at it, uh,

07:10.563 --> 07:13.005
more seriously, and we took it on.

07:13.105 --> 07:14.427
I can't remember what we called it.

07:14.887 --> 07:16.849
I'm sure they have something like that now.

07:17.930 --> 07:28.560
So that while it didn't affect, was not supposed to affect the decision to accept the manuscript, at least we'd have some clue to how much money we were going to lose.

07:29.221 --> 07:39.591
So then, some years later, when we were focusing even more on this, it's when I was executive editor, I thought

07:40.415 --> 07:46.624
Well, we don't really have an idea of how many books in each list are really good.

07:47.485 --> 07:58.201
I mean, really popular in the syllabi view of How Many Are the Dogs, with titles like Money in Foreign Exchange in Fourteenth-Century France.

07:58.241 --> 08:00.063
That was one of my favorite titles.

08:00.324 --> 08:01.225
And he published that?

08:01.441 --> 08:04.986
How did it do, just generally, if you could find something?

08:05.006 --> 08:07.249
Oh, it did not do very well, I suppose.

08:07.809 --> 08:09.892
I bet we didn't even sell a thousand.

08:09.912 --> 08:10.393
I don't know.

08:10.413 --> 08:16.400
But it was by a really well-respected economist at Yale, and it was a very good book.

08:16.421 --> 08:22.789
It's just that there are not an awful lot of people interested in money in the 14th century of France.

08:22.989 --> 08:25.432
Would a book like that be published today, do you think?

08:25.452 --> 08:27.775
Well, today I have no idea what they publish.

08:27.895 --> 08:31.380
It probably would have been published at the time I left.

08:32.018 --> 08:59.393
We were still publishing like that, some like that, but I thought we ought to know in any forthcoming list how many we had that might sell well, how many we had that were typical university press books, and how many were like money prices and foreign exchange in 14th century France.

09:00.672 --> 09:03.956
By then, yes, Chester was, was Chester here?

09:04.036 --> 09:06.179
No, I think it was John Ryden was here by then.

09:07.100 --> 09:17.473
And so I made out a little chart of A books, which sold this number, B books, another number, C books, which were the not so saleable ones.

09:17.493 --> 09:19.435
But what was an A book in your estimation?

09:19.455 --> 09:22.579
An A book was probably, I think it was over five,

09:23.318 --> 09:25.000
Was it over 5,000?

09:25.221 --> 09:25.921
I'm guessing.

09:26.162 --> 09:27.183
Did you have a lot of books?

09:27.303 --> 09:28.064
Did you have books?

09:28.365 --> 09:29.706
We would have maybe three.

09:29.726 --> 09:30.788
A year?

09:31.509 --> 09:32.510
Yeah.

09:32.550 --> 09:34.132
Or maybe a season.

09:35.314 --> 09:36.676
Now, maybe it was fewer than that.

09:36.716 --> 09:37.957
Maybe it was 2,500.

09:38.118 --> 09:39.700
I honestly don't remember.

09:40.781 --> 09:45.327
And I don't mean to interrupt your train of thought, but I was just

09:45.577 --> 09:48.121
To continue, you made up a list of A books, B books, C books.

09:48.141 --> 09:48.641
A books, B books.

09:48.661 --> 10:01.840
So that every time we went, met once a month in John Ryden's office before the Publications Committee met, and by then he would have a list of the books we thought would make the next list.

10:01.860 --> 10:12.615
And they would be divided up, A books, B books, and C books, so we'd have some clue to what we had on the forthcoming list.

10:12.635 --> 10:15.499
And it might be a moment when John would want to

10:17.116 --> 10:29.688
speed up the production of an A book, because he saw we were a little short, or maybe find means, which editors always can do, of postponing some of the C books.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.731
So how did you decide what was going to be an A book?

10:32.751 --> 10:34.413
I mean, did you get some sort of sense?

10:34.773 --> 10:37.156
Did you have your thumb on the pulse of the audience out there?

10:37.736 --> 10:38.397
Oh, of course.

10:38.597 --> 10:44.162
No, it was our guess, based on other books, and other books we'd had on our list.

10:44.563 --> 10:46.785
We'd compared a lot.

10:47.204 --> 10:50.007
with books that had seemed like that.

10:50.027 --> 10:53.051
And we didn't have the databases that they had today where they could do all of this.

10:53.071 --> 10:53.792
No, we had nothing.

10:54.513 --> 10:55.174
We had nothing now.

10:55.194 --> 11:03.744
Of course, the marketing department played a role in this, and they didn't always agree with the editors' inflated ideas of how much some books would sell.

11:04.626 --> 11:08.310
So, and it was never considered rigid.

11:09.452 --> 11:16.300
These were our expectations for these books, but, and we did

11:16.567 --> 11:23.116
from season to season to see how well books did, so that, uh... So did you keep scoring?

11:23.616 --> 11:24.638
Were you pretty good at it?

11:24.718 --> 11:27.401
Did you read A books, pretty much A books, and your Bs?

11:28.022 --> 11:32.288
Well, I guess, if anything, well, I think we usually overestimated.

11:32.969 --> 11:37.515
Not always by a great deal, but usually by some.

11:37.535 --> 11:44.104
So, um... So a C would be what, like fewer than a thousand?

11:44.124 --> 11:44.464
Yeah.

11:44.748 --> 11:46.930
and often they were dissertations.

11:47.851 --> 11:57.521
We published fewer and fewer dissertations as time applied, but we did feel it was our responsibility to publish a good dissertation.

11:57.641 --> 12:00.885
And you feel that's still the responsibility of the university press, do you think?

12:01.225 --> 12:03.187
Well, I don't know that much about publishing.

12:03.227 --> 12:08.713
I think there may be other ways of getting those manuscripts

12:09.335 --> 12:11.618
to the attention of those who need them.

12:11.638 --> 12:14.503
The electronic alternative, of course, is what they're talking about.

12:14.523 --> 12:14.623
Yeah.

12:14.643 --> 12:28.984
But one very important thing to the author was that if an author had a book published by Yale, the faculty, deciding whether he'd be promoted or not, was very interested.

12:29.044 --> 12:37.536
And sometimes we'd get telephone calls from promotion committees or faculty members in other universities.

12:38.258 --> 12:49.392
asking whether we had accepted a certain book, and they were very impatient and were not terribly pleased if it was still out for reading or still in process.

12:49.412 --> 12:53.958
So did the press kind of indirectly get drawn into this publish-or-perish paradigm?

12:53.978 --> 12:54.459
Oh, yes.

12:55.420 --> 13:05.633
We didn't directly, obviously, and that didn't play any role on the selection part, but clearly if professors were up for it.

13:06.187 --> 13:10.172
or whatever here, and how everything was riding on this dissertation.

13:11.214 --> 13:12.315
Would we speed it up?

13:12.335 --> 13:13.417
Yeah, would you speed it up?

13:13.677 --> 13:14.418
Well, we might.

13:14.438 --> 13:16.301
Did you run into that a lot?

13:16.661 --> 13:17.583
Often, I suppose.

13:17.663 --> 13:18.985
No, no, that wasn't.

13:19.045 --> 13:22.489
Were you alert to it as being part of the subtext, though, that was up there?

13:22.509 --> 13:24.132
Yes, it didn't happen very often.

13:25.033 --> 13:27.336
And, of course, we did know, and it did.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.040
But I don't remember.

13:30.560 --> 13:35.367
We couldn't, on most of those books, you know, spend extra money to get it out faster.

13:35.667 --> 13:41.814
because they were not going to help our bottom lines that much.

13:41.834 --> 14:00.797
But one thing I enjoyed about the press in all the years I was here, that there has always been a very strong sense of our responsibility to publish good scholarship and do the best we could do to

14:02.178 --> 14:03.319
support ourselves.

14:03.439 --> 14:08.244
And this press, as we know now, unlike others, has no subsidy from the university.

14:08.344 --> 14:08.945
That's amazing.

14:09.245 --> 14:13.509
And that it should be operating in the Black College.

14:13.529 --> 14:13.949
It's amazing.

14:13.969 --> 14:14.750
Does that astound you?

14:15.211 --> 14:15.951
It is amazing.

14:15.971 --> 14:22.177
We had some very hard times, and there was a time when Chester Kerr had to borrow from the university.

14:22.197 --> 14:24.960
It had been in his seventies.

14:26.521 --> 14:31.206
And when he said his way of cutting costs

14:31.979 --> 14:34.882
was to cut entire books out.

14:35.002 --> 14:43.510
If we had, what, 54 books on the next list, he'd cut it back to 50, something like that.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.554
That was his way of saving money when times were really bad.

14:47.954 --> 14:51.317
I mean, he never cut staff to save money.

14:53.419 --> 15:01.767
He would just postpone books, and we would have to think of something to tell the authors that would sound plausible.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.343
So did the press operate in the red in those years?

15:06.003 --> 15:07.004
We must have.

15:07.084 --> 15:09.607
I didn't see figures like that.

15:11.749 --> 15:13.971
But we did have to borrow from the university.

15:13.991 --> 15:15.312
So you had to borrow from the university?

15:15.332 --> 15:15.472
Yeah.

15:15.512 --> 15:21.097
I was wondering, because if you weren't getting subsidies, where was the difference coming from?

15:21.117 --> 15:22.779
Well, that's a good question.

15:22.799 --> 15:23.720
Good question.

15:23.740 --> 15:25.622
I should ask somebody that question, right?

15:25.642 --> 15:31.247
Now, during the... when I first came, we were publishing the...

15:32.577 --> 15:33.538
New Math.

15:33.678 --> 15:35.039
You've heard about the New Math?

15:36.260 --> 15:40.784
And I was told that that was really financing the growth of the press.

15:42.906 --> 15:47.770
We weren't supposed to make money, and I think the government eventually asked for some of it back.

15:49.071 --> 15:51.213
You weren't supposed to make money?

15:51.233 --> 15:56.958
No, the reason we published it was that it was financed by the federal government.

15:56.978 --> 15:57.919
On this particular book?

15:58.440 --> 16:01.302
Well, it's a whole series, The New Math, for

16:01.923 --> 16:05.969
So you said you weren't supposed to be making money on this project, not as a press.

16:05.989 --> 16:06.710
On that project.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.753
And that's why they came to University Press.

16:08.773 --> 16:16.043
They didn't want a commercial publisher to be making a lot of money on the federal government's investment.

16:16.063 --> 16:17.385
Times have changed, I guess.

16:17.425 --> 16:29.162
But anyway, so we did make quite a lot of money on that, and I was told that that project really financed the growth of the press, and it grew a lot.

16:29.632 --> 16:33.516
in the 60s and, I guess, 70s, 80s.

16:34.938 --> 16:36.380
How many books are published now?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.062
Close to 300 a year.

16:38.923 --> 16:39.703
Can you believe it?

16:39.724 --> 16:41.886
I mean, that's bigger than most trade houses.

16:41.986 --> 16:44.149
I can remember when we were shooting for 50.

16:44.729 --> 16:45.030
Wow.

16:46.091 --> 16:47.512
You said you came here from New York.

16:47.793 --> 16:49.134
What did you do in New York?

16:49.675 --> 16:56.803
Well, I worked for 10 years for a foundation, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

16:58.353 --> 16:59.715
It was ten years, I think.

17:00.736 --> 17:03.779
And I had worked for another foundation before that.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.384
So this was your first publishing?

17:07.424 --> 17:08.105
First publishing.

17:08.125 --> 17:16.515
I did work mostly in editorial work in this foundation, but this was my first publishing.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.680
So how does someone choose to be an editor?

17:20.700 --> 17:22.842
Do you mind if I shoot a couple of pictures, by the way?

17:22.922 --> 17:23.543
Oh, yeah.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.668
I'm keeping a visual record, too, on the people I'm talking to.

17:28.475 --> 17:32.560
I'll be very... I promise, but great.

17:32.580 --> 17:35.643
You had worked in the foundation, and you had done some editing, you said.

17:35.724 --> 17:37.385
How does one get into editing?

17:38.146 --> 17:38.307
Yeah.

17:38.347 --> 17:41.731
Especially at this level, this kind of editing, too.

17:41.751 --> 17:42.692
This kind of editing?

17:42.712 --> 17:57.349
Well, editing in general, and... Well, I had a master's degree from Columbia in what they called public law and government then, and that is political science.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.330
And...

17:58.867 --> 18:00.449
So what do you do with that?

18:00.910 --> 18:04.195
Well, I thought about going into the State Department.

18:04.215 --> 18:13.127
The State Department could offer me a job as a secretary, but they couldn't offer me a job of any substance.

18:13.147 --> 18:15.010
So I wasn't interested in that.

18:16.912 --> 18:27.287
And then I guess I saw in the paper that somebody was leaving a job at something called the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.

18:27.908 --> 18:39.126
and was working on a publication called The United Nations News, and that happened to be precisely within my zone of interest, so I applied for it and got it.

18:39.947 --> 18:45.456
And that little publication, The United Nations, I've always worked for losers, I guess.

18:46.438 --> 18:53.950
That went out of business, actually, and it was being financed by the Carnegie Endowment, and at that point they had an opening.

18:54.318 --> 18:58.944
And so I just kind of, people drift into editorial work, I think.

18:58.964 --> 19:05.251
So I worked, I did mostly editorial work, some administrative, but mostly editorial.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.616
Now, did you bring authors to the press, or?

19:09.136 --> 19:10.017
To this press?

19:10.037 --> 19:10.218
Yeah.

19:10.398 --> 19:12.100
I mean, once you were established, and once you .

19:12.120 --> 19:12.140
.

19:12.160 --> 19:12.180
.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.042
Well, at first, we didn't.

19:14.303 --> 19:18.688
We just sat and waited for things to come over the transom.

19:19.580 --> 19:28.232
But as time went on, and we were building the list, it became necessary for us to exert ourselves.

19:29.474 --> 19:34.681
So we did start going out to get authors.

19:35.362 --> 19:36.464
And so what were you looking for?

19:36.564 --> 19:37.866
How did you decide?

19:37.926 --> 19:49.182
Well, I guess all of us were looking for the best scholarship, and often, of course, that was the best-known scholars.

19:50.528 --> 19:54.852
Younger scholars, you could tell, were very promising.

19:55.232 --> 20:00.597
Here at Yale or everywhere in general?

20:00.617 --> 20:01.098
Everywhere.

20:01.138 --> 20:03.740
We went to professional meetings.

20:03.880 --> 20:09.706
We didn't take very many trips, but occasionally we'd go around to a few colleges and universities.

20:09.806 --> 20:12.929
I never found that terribly satisfactory.

20:12.949 --> 20:17.413
But we did go to the meetings, professional meetings, and saw a lot of authors there.

20:17.731 --> 20:20.835
And also, one author would suggest another one.

20:22.157 --> 20:26.943
So there were a variety, and we read the journals in our own fields.

20:27.604 --> 20:31.990
I can't say I read the economics journals very carefully, but I did look at them.

20:32.731 --> 20:40.081
And we did get, we did publish, all of us, a lot of Yale-connected books.

20:40.281 --> 20:44.447
Yale had a first-rate political science department, and we published

20:45.136 --> 20:53.347
a number of dissertations from that department by people who were amazing, people who later became masters in their field.

20:53.367 --> 20:54.749
Can you figure out any examples?

20:57.652 --> 21:04.401
Well, a fellow, let's see, I'm not sure, Stanley Greenberg was one.

21:04.481 --> 21:14.755
He is now, well, he is now a Democratic pollster, very prominent.

21:15.747 --> 21:17.309
Who were some of the others?

21:18.290 --> 21:19.792
Gee, I'm not good on names.

21:19.832 --> 21:20.172
That's okay.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.677
If some jumped out, I'd be curious to know.

21:23.697 --> 21:25.459
Well, they'll probably jump out when I get home.

21:25.679 --> 21:36.872
There were five or six just first-rate political scientists who said, well, Jeffrey, somebody, well, that's not going to help you.

21:41.538 --> 21:45.703
And some of them, I noticed with astonishment, have now retired.

21:47.067 --> 21:54.358
So I saw them from their dissertation to retirement.

21:54.478 --> 21:58.223
So Yale had a first-rate department that attracted very good people.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.767
And they, of course, would suggest other people.

22:00.787 --> 22:10.982
And then the young ones went out and taught elsewhere so that I would be introduced to other people in other departments.

22:12.064 --> 22:16.230
And in economics,

22:16.902 --> 22:19.965
Yale again had a first great Department of Economics.

22:20.846 --> 22:29.575
We published a series on economic development edited by a fellow named Lloyd Reynolds.

22:30.456 --> 22:30.977
Lloyd?

22:30.997 --> 22:33.780
Lloyd, L-L-O-Y-D, Reynolds.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.502
Reynolds.

22:35.522 --> 22:42.589
And he, and this was early, well this must have been in the

22:44.392 --> 22:45.994
maybe late 60s and 70s.

22:46.094 --> 22:47.737
I'm only guessing at these dates.

22:50.982 --> 22:57.431
But he had first-rate economists doing those.

22:57.451 --> 23:10.770
They were short books on various phases of economic development, and a number of those authors have since gotten Nobel Prizes in economics that really are

23:11.645 --> 23:36.977
outstanding group of authors and they started here with you and they started here but that was Lloyd Reynolds came to the press I didn't have to I didn't bring him to the press he came to the press he's a very loyal Yale man and then we published other we didn't have a big book a big list in economics

23:37.885 --> 23:42.430
And a lot of the work, important work in economics, was being done in the journals, anyway.

23:43.471 --> 23:45.673
But it's changed, hasn't it?

23:45.693 --> 23:47.695
The journals are almost... Oh, really?

23:48.015 --> 23:50.838
Well, just journals in general, I think, are on the decline.

23:50.998 --> 23:51.979
They're so expensive.

23:52.720 --> 23:53.941
I know the libraries.

23:54.101 --> 23:57.324
They're looking for the electronic journal stuff.

23:57.344 --> 24:01.428
I mean, that's something that's really going to change, and it's going to continue to change.

24:01.448 --> 24:04.011
Is that where scholars read?

24:04.784 --> 24:06.006
other scholars were.

24:06.146 --> 24:16.221
I think, especially in the sciences, not so much in the humanities and things, but I think you still find journal articles being important.

24:16.241 --> 24:18.845
But they're so expensive, between $30,000 subscriptions and things a year.

24:18.966 --> 24:24.053
Well, of course, they don't have very large markets, so... That's a lot of money.

24:24.073 --> 24:24.935
Well, I don't know.

24:26.116 --> 24:33.087
We always used to expect that something like 40 libraries, I think, that would always buy every book

24:33.708 --> 24:37.594
And I suppose we'd buy every journal, but you couldn't go much beyond that.

24:37.774 --> 24:38.094
Forty.

24:38.395 --> 24:38.715
Forty.

24:38.735 --> 24:39.737
That was the magic number.

24:40.378 --> 24:44.103
And would that justify the publication of the prediction?

24:44.123 --> 24:45.665
Oh, not, no, not by us.

24:47.047 --> 24:48.429
I don't know about the journals.

24:48.469 --> 24:49.511
So what was the threshold?

24:50.392 --> 24:51.534
For our publication?

24:52.575 --> 24:52.736
Yeah.

24:52.876 --> 24:54.879
Well, probably.

24:56.681 --> 24:57.262
A thousand.

24:57.322 --> 25:01.628
I'm sure we must have done some under a thousand, but I imagine we printed a thousand.

25:02.670 --> 25:03.411
Never sold.

25:03.695 --> 25:11.285
So, what are some of your most memorable projects?

25:11.305 --> 25:11.606
Books?

25:11.666 --> 25:16.672
Well, there was an author at Yale, now emeritus, named Robert Dahl.

25:18.054 --> 25:31.913
His first real book I worked on here at the press was a book of his called Who Governs?, which is about New Haven, and that was a landmark book in political science.

25:32.382 --> 25:36.846
And he is an absolutely wonderful man to work with.

25:36.866 --> 25:40.389
I think the press is still publishing his books.

25:40.449 --> 25:51.019
His field is democracy, and I guess he is certainly the most well-known scholar in that field.

25:51.819 --> 25:55.703
And it's about New Haven, so you talk about covering a local story, so to speak.

25:56.003 --> 25:59.826
Well, he's broadened out a lot after that.

25:59.847 --> 26:01.528
I mean, that was a microcosm.

26:01.812 --> 26:05.816
But I mean, just either coincidence or otherwise, it happened to be right here.

26:07.278 --> 26:10.081
Well, New Haven was a very interesting city at that time.

26:10.141 --> 26:30.604
It had a mayor, Robert Lee, Robert C. Lee, I guess, who was very interested in urban development, and unfortunately there were some not very good ideas that all of them were picking up at that time, like demolishing

26:31.411 --> 26:39.540
one of the old neighborhoods of New Haven, to put in a connector from the highway.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.962
Highways were everything.

26:41.783 --> 26:54.517
So, Lee was a well-known mayor, and looking at this city was particularly interesting for Robert Dahl, but he was in New Haven, so that made it.

26:54.758 --> 26:57.040
Now, that was the first time you mentioned.

26:57.060 --> 27:01.165
Was that one of the first ones you did, or that was one of the more surprising

27:01.685 --> 27:02.746
That book.

27:04.168 --> 27:06.230
That was the first real book I did.

27:06.711 --> 27:10.234
I mean, I had a couple of others that weren't terribly interesting before that.

27:10.415 --> 27:12.116
The first real book, meaning?

27:12.457 --> 27:13.298
Meaning important.

27:13.378 --> 27:26.292
It was an important book in his field, and he has been a much honored author since then, and I don't know, he had published books before that, but I think that was, he really made his mark with that book.

27:26.761 --> 27:28.323
become the editor of that?

27:28.343 --> 27:29.824
Because it was political science.

27:29.844 --> 27:30.945
So that was your department?

27:30.965 --> 27:33.788
It was my department, so it came rolling in to me.

27:34.128 --> 27:38.533
So did it come, at what point does it fall into your lap?

27:38.553 --> 27:40.535
I mean, after it goes to the Publications Committee?

27:40.555 --> 27:41.075
Oh, no.

27:41.976 --> 27:43.818
Or he walks in with this proposal?

27:43.878 --> 27:47.221
He either walks in, I don't remember whether it was a proposal or a manuscript.

27:47.301 --> 27:49.223
It was probably a manuscript at that time.

27:50.485 --> 27:53.347
He walks in with the manuscript, and he knew Chester.

27:53.568 --> 27:55.890
Chester had a wide acquaintance.

27:55.988 --> 27:57.730
And that helped a great deal.

27:58.390 --> 28:11.723
And I would have gotten it at that stage, because it was the editor who first read it and decided whether it was worthy of our attention, and then, if so, got an outside reader to read it and make a report.

28:12.504 --> 28:17.949
And if the report was favorable, then it went to the publications committee.

28:18.029 --> 28:24.375
But in many cases, manuscripts fell by the wayside, either because the editor, rightly or wrongly,

28:24.845 --> 28:35.015
thought it wasn't good enough, or it was outside really the scope of our publishing.

28:35.056 --> 28:41.042
That is, we had nothing else in that field, which would have made it a little hard to promote.

28:41.422 --> 28:43.164
Or we got a bad reader's report.

28:43.244 --> 28:47.528
And sometimes if the editor... We got only one reader's report.

28:47.588 --> 28:52.033
Many university presses got two, and I don't know what it's done now.

28:52.604 --> 29:13.975
But we got only one, and that report, plus the editors, was enough to take a book to the Publications Committee, which could decide to accept it, and mostly they did, or they could decide they wanted another reason for one reason or another.

29:13.995 --> 29:16.338
So a reader's report is pretty important.

29:16.359 --> 29:17.560
Oh, extremely.

29:17.580 --> 29:20.164
I've had four of them, and I did one for here.

29:20.870 --> 29:31.001
I did one for the University of California, and I did one for the University of New England Press, and I'm wondering, I'm hoping I wasn't too critical.

29:31.221 --> 29:35.365
Well... I hope I wasn't responsible for these... Well, they want your criticisms.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.469
Because I hate to wrap an author on another one.

29:38.489 --> 29:41.952
Well, of course, it depends on the kind of criticism.

29:42.052 --> 29:48.379
If it's ideas that you felt were off the wall or something, why that might kill it.

29:48.713 --> 29:53.340
If you had criticisms, it could be false.

29:53.380 --> 29:57.807
It could be corrected in further work, or rewriting.

29:57.927 --> 30:00.430
Which is what I basically suggested in every case.

30:01.392 --> 30:04.136
I thought an expression left a lot to be desired.

30:04.436 --> 30:11.948
In one project here, I thought that what I read was good, but there was so much that seemed to have been ignored.

30:11.968 --> 30:12.328
Yes.

30:12.969 --> 30:15.613
And that book has had to appear.

30:15.633 --> 30:17.556
Well, that can be very helpful.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.580
And the press could do a number of things.

30:19.720 --> 30:25.731
First, it could simply send it back to the author and say, can you do something and then resubmit it?

30:26.071 --> 30:39.234
Or, if it looked like a very promising project, we could take it to the Publications Committee, which could say, well, we accept it provided you do these things on it.

30:41.498 --> 30:43.341
Or they might just

30:44.468 --> 30:48.192
decided that it was too serious, the author wasn't likely to be able to do it.

30:49.894 --> 30:56.382
But the Reader's Report is really critical for us, because this is a world of scholarship.

30:56.542 --> 31:04.332
I feel a great responsibility doing that, as an author who has also felt this thing of rejection.

31:04.352 --> 31:05.153
Yes.

31:06.414 --> 31:13.142
Well, I can only remember one occasion, and I'm sure there were others, when I was simply unaware

31:13.460 --> 31:20.688
when I somehow put the manuscript in the hands of somebody who violently disagreed with the author.

31:20.748 --> 31:34.944
It was a feminist book, and a lot of different factions in the scholarly world.

31:35.204 --> 31:43.433
And I got a devastating reader's report, which I couldn't believe, because the author was rather well-known.

31:44.020 --> 31:47.405
And so I got another reader's report, which was favorable.

31:47.826 --> 31:52.793
But the first one, it was clearly a case of... Picking the wrong reader, probably.

31:52.813 --> 31:53.875
Yeah, picking the wrong reader.

31:54.055 --> 31:57.801
I was a book review editor for a lot of years up in Massachusetts.

31:57.821 --> 32:03.089
And to me, the most important responsibility you have is matching the right reviewer with the book.

32:03.189 --> 32:03.549
Yes.

32:04.210 --> 32:05.252
You get somebody that's...

32:05.873 --> 32:11.920
That's knowing your people, of course, and not that you always want a favorable review, but you want a fair one.

32:11.960 --> 32:12.601
No, that's right.

32:12.621 --> 32:22.412
You want a fair reading, and you want to leave all the baggage and all the ego at the doorstep, and just kind of come in and assess the book on its merits.

32:22.432 --> 32:33.265
I know instantly when you have somebody who's hostile for reasons that are not particularly on point with the book, and that I think you probably learned

32:33.852 --> 32:36.194
to say, maybe I need to get another look.

32:37.155 --> 32:45.623
And we, I mean, obviously we couldn't keep track of all the currents in the fields we dealt with.

32:46.544 --> 32:59.196
Sometimes I would call a Yale faculty member I knew and ask if he or she didn't want to read it, to suggest a reader, and that was very helpful.

33:00.217 --> 33:02.880
I remember

33:03.215 --> 33:08.982
We were, for a while, without a philosophy editor.

33:09.022 --> 33:16.972
She had left, and no one was handling philosophy, so I handled a book on William James, about whom I know very little.

33:17.934 --> 33:29.408
And this was quite a big manuscript, and it was clear as I looked at it that it was written with authority, and I called a Yale faculty member.

33:30.164 --> 33:32.286
And he didn't want to read it.

33:32.367 --> 33:36.011
Unfortunately, he would have been a good reader, but he suggested a reader.

33:37.032 --> 33:45.001
And we got a wonderful report on it and published it, and we got very well reviewed.

33:46.083 --> 34:00.019
But, as I say, we couldn't possibly keep track of all the currents of rivalries and animosities and friendships in the scholarly world.

34:00.083 --> 34:02.445
You mentioned the book on New Haven, Who Governs?

34:03.326 --> 34:03.787
Any others?

34:03.847 --> 34:11.015
And I think you probably remember that, not only because it was an important book, but it was your first big book or important book.

34:11.035 --> 34:17.922
So what others take particular pride in having, I should, through the press, shall we say?

34:17.942 --> 34:26.631
Well, I don't know about pride, but certainly one of the most interesting was a series of books about

34:27.590 --> 34:36.319
four or five by a member of the law school faculty, Myers McDougall, M-Y-R-E-S, Myers McDougall.

34:37.420 --> 34:43.366
And he, his field was international law, and oh, there was one on the law of the sea.

34:44.607 --> 34:52.175
Each book was on some area of international law, and they were big books.

34:53.536 --> 34:56.179
And at the time,

34:57.053 --> 35:15.795
they were, how can I say, I don't know, well, he had a very vocal and very strong set of people who believed that he had found a new way of dealing with international law.

35:16.836 --> 35:22.302
And I was interested to work on those, because I was very interested in international law.

35:22.670 --> 35:29.097
In the end, I have a feeling they have dropped like stones in the ocean.

35:29.117 --> 35:33.902
And that was one of the most curious experiences.

35:33.922 --> 35:39.449
He had a very what I call involved style of writing.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.571
What kind of style, sir?

35:42.051 --> 35:44.194
Well, I say involved.

35:44.214 --> 35:44.754
Oh, involved.

35:44.775 --> 35:44.855
OK.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.456
But I'm not sure that's it.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.740
Very scholarly.

35:50.345 --> 35:52.848
Inaccessible or inaccessible?

35:53.549 --> 35:54.650
Inaccessible.

35:54.990 --> 35:58.154
And he wouldn't put up with editing.

35:58.174 --> 36:01.117
He would barely put in a comma.

36:01.137 --> 36:07.464
And he would argue against it.

36:08.565 --> 36:09.426
Now, who else?

36:11.308 --> 36:15.693
A fellow named David Mayhew in the Yale Department.

36:15.713 --> 36:17.695
He published a book of his on Congress.

36:17.816 --> 36:19.137
I can't remember the title.

36:19.319 --> 36:39.483
I couldn't remember titles when I was here, so I'm not good at titles, but we published a book of his on Congress, and he was quite an important author, and the Congress is of interest to a large number of political scientists, so he did well.

36:39.644 --> 36:47.453
I think he was one of the ones who published his dissertation originally, and he became

36:48.125 --> 36:49.727
really in his field.

36:50.908 --> 36:51.890
What else?

36:51.910 --> 36:52.671
Economics.

36:54.072 --> 37:00.300
I can't think of his name or the title.

37:00.560 --> 37:04.044
How about working with authors in particular?

37:04.485 --> 37:11.654
Did you develop any kind of memorable professional relationships with any of your authors?

37:12.375 --> 37:15.178
Well, I would say so.

37:15.597 --> 37:44.170
I enjoyed very much working with authors, and I enjoyed, of course, they were working in fields I was particularly interested in, so I had a lot of friends, no close friends, but when I went to the conferences, I could see most of these people, and they tended to come back with the next manuscript.

37:45.888 --> 37:58.784
That one's a little hard to answer, but at any rate, I had a very good group of authors, and there were very few that I had problems with.

37:58.805 --> 38:00.807
All of us had problems with some of us.

38:02.629 --> 38:10.279
Any regrets, things, books that got away that maybe you feel that... Yeah, there was one.

38:11.341 --> 38:14.865
I only think of one, as a matter of fact, and I think of it now and then, because

38:16.499 --> 38:41.457
can't remember the author's name once again, and I guess it was eventually published, but his thesis was that democracy was not very likely to take hold in Latin America because of the strong authoritarian background they had, the Catholic Church particularly, and I could not get a good report on that.

38:42.298 --> 38:45.443
I don't know, I have a feeling that that was partly

38:46.233 --> 38:52.643
People didn't want to endorse a theory like that.

38:54.085 --> 38:57.190
I don't know what... I'm sure it's anti-democratic.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.373
I don't... Or it could be perceived as being so.

38:59.553 --> 39:13.995
Well, that is the way he perceived it, and he felt that people who were living in that kind of culture were not very likely to supposedly become Democrats, so they're democratic.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.970
So, that's one I regret.

39:17.070 --> 39:21.816
I think it was... Well, you regret it because you thought it was... I thought it was important.

39:21.876 --> 39:26.141
And I thought it was worth... And it was well-researched and well-reasoned.

39:26.161 --> 39:26.602
That's right.

39:26.622 --> 39:29.846
And he had every right to have that theory, whether he was right or wrong.

39:30.507 --> 39:35.413
And you thought that the role of a university press is to give a... Yes, indeed.

39:35.433 --> 39:36.394
Something like that a forum.

39:36.895 --> 39:37.416
That's right.

39:37.456 --> 39:37.796
A life.

39:38.357 --> 39:38.958
That's right.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.860
As I say, I believe

39:41.009 --> 39:43.773
So did you champion it and lose?

39:44.554 --> 39:48.779
I couldn't get a good reader's report, so I couldn't go further with it here.

39:48.859 --> 39:54.907
I don't know why there probably was a reader, or there were readers somewhere, that I just didn't happen to get.

39:55.507 --> 39:59.312
Once you get a couple of bad reports, you might as well give up.

39:59.492 --> 40:09.345
And one thing that always gave us great comfort was that if we didn't publish a book, it was good somebody else would publish it, so that it didn't mean that

40:09.443 --> 40:11.785
The book would never see the light of day.

40:13.207 --> 40:19.854
And authors now and then told us we were making a mistake, and we didn't publish their books.

40:21.195 --> 40:24.879
And I think what they meant was they wanted Yale to publish them.

40:26.420 --> 40:38.573
So Yale has always, other than of course being Yale, but as a press has always had that distinction of being, if you're published by Yale, it's... That's right, and that matters to promotion.

40:38.789 --> 40:43.716
committees and matters in getting a job.

40:44.757 --> 40:52.147
To go back to what you said earlier about the reader, here's a case of where you believed in a book, and yet, so why even bother with the reader?

40:52.388 --> 40:54.390
I mean, can't you trust your own judgment on that?

40:54.410 --> 41:01.961
Well, the Publications Committee is a committee of scholars, and, wow, they didn't consider the editors to be scholars.

41:02.982 --> 41:05.185
So who did you, you're just basically

41:05.755 --> 41:07.437
Shuffling copy, in other words.

41:07.457 --> 41:09.119
Well, not entirely.

41:09.199 --> 41:10.340
In their view, I mean.

41:10.360 --> 41:16.026
They listened to us, and in our view counted, but not alone.

41:16.687 --> 41:17.728
I mean, not the only.

41:18.329 --> 41:21.993
They wanted a scholar's take.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.956
Yes, a scholar's approval of the manuscript.

41:24.976 --> 41:26.238
Well, they were all scholars.

41:27.099 --> 41:29.541
So could they have read it?

41:29.762 --> 41:30.523
Sometimes they did.

41:30.543 --> 41:34.547
There was usually a political scientist on the committee,

41:34.747 --> 42:03.792
there's a committee of how many seven eight nine I remember and so editors sometimes had a member of the committee who could look at a manuscript and in a few cases the member of the committee might give the final answer on a manuscript usually unless it was strictly in the scholars field they're not going to

42:04.447 --> 42:12.417
pretend that they can pass judgment on a manuscript and some related, but not dependent.

42:12.437 --> 42:15.601
So, is this comparable to being peer-reviewed, or is that a whole other thing?

42:16.482 --> 42:17.263
I would say so.

42:18.584 --> 42:20.567
It's what the journals have always done.

42:20.827 --> 42:28.516
I mean, that's kind of an unofficial explanation of what's going on.

42:29.417 --> 42:29.998
That's right.

42:30.704 --> 42:31.805
That's an interesting story.

42:31.825 --> 42:37.832
This was something you believed in, and you thought, and I would think that The Passage of Time was borne out the thesis of the writer, too.

42:38.252 --> 42:50.186
Well, I thought it would, but apparently that, and as I say, there probably were readers there who would have been the right readers for that manuscript, but I didn't find them.

42:50.226 --> 42:52.769
There was an argument, and so if you don't agree with it, challenge it.

42:53.089 --> 42:53.630
Dispute it.

42:54.250 --> 42:56.673
Say you've got to disagree with it.

42:56.693 --> 43:00.357
Well, I had another manuscript

43:02.581 --> 43:08.427
I got a report challenging a lot of the manuscript.

43:08.447 --> 43:12.550
And did I get another reader?

43:14.272 --> 43:19.237
I may have gotten another reader who gave it a good report, generally.

43:19.717 --> 43:21.819
And everything has to be shown to the committee.

43:21.839 --> 43:23.761
If there's a negative report, they have to see it.

43:24.302 --> 43:32.149
But this was a case where they thought it was just a disagreement that should be settled in another book.

43:33.395 --> 43:34.417
something like that.

43:35.298 --> 43:37.000
So this committee meeting must be something.

43:37.822 --> 43:38.442
Oh, yes.

43:38.603 --> 43:53.024
Well, the editors have to be very well prepared to defend their choices, and the members of the committee see every report, and the editor writes a report on the manuscript.

43:53.044 --> 43:57.551
I don't think, at that time, they didn't see the financial information.

43:57.571 --> 44:02.558
We had that, which we discussed ourselves before we went to the Publications Committee.

44:03.095 --> 44:16.639
They didn't see that, and I remember we used to have a controversy over whether the head of the marketing department should go to those meetings, and the editors were mostly opposed to that.

44:17.560 --> 44:21.447
We just didn't think there should be any hint that there was money.

44:21.467 --> 44:22.328
Commerce.

44:22.348 --> 44:23.551
There was money.

44:23.571 --> 44:24.152
Commerce.

44:24.392 --> 44:26.115
Well, do you think they go now, of course?

44:26.467 --> 44:27.148
You do.

44:27.168 --> 44:30.553
So that's a major change since the time you arrived in 1959.

44:30.573 --> 44:35.501
Well, I think I was particularly opposed to it, and I don't think I'd been gone a week before.

44:36.903 --> 44:39.948
So up until the time you left, you were opposed to it?

44:39.968 --> 44:44.155
No, I opposed it, and I think that John Ryden was kind of in favor of it.

44:44.175 --> 44:46.538
And the person, have you met Tina Weiner?

44:46.558 --> 44:46.799
I have, yes.

44:46.819 --> 44:54.010
Well, she's a wonderful person, and unusual in that she read manuscripts, I don't know whether she does now,

44:54.479 --> 44:58.646
She read manuscripts, and this is not what marketing managers do.

44:58.666 --> 45:13.973
And I can remember being at a meeting at the university presses, and I was talking to the director of the Harvard Press, and somehow marketing managers came up, and I said, Tina, read some of the manuscript, and he couldn't believe it.

45:14.560 --> 45:24.909
Because, obviously, the marketing manager... How are they supposed to be able to predict a market if they don't know what the thing's about?

45:24.969 --> 45:28.132
No, the style of writing... I can understand.

45:28.152 --> 45:36.360
I just learned yesterday, and it doesn't surprise me, because my own book, which is coming out in November, they had the dust jacket then before they even had the manuscript.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.043
How can they possibly do a dust jacket for a book they haven't even seen yet, you know?

45:40.464 --> 45:41.985
They didn't have the manuscript.

45:42.590 --> 45:55.709
Well, they did, but all it did was put more pressure on me to get the thing in, which is what I did, and I was happy to do it, but Nancy was telling me yesterday, and I said, how often do the designers read the manuscripts at Harvey, ever?

45:56.550 --> 46:09.829
Well, the mark, I don't know about designers, although we all had first-rate designers, and I suspect the manuscript was of interest, but Tina, conscientiously, it doesn't matter, she read the manuscript, not all of them,

46:10.349 --> 46:14.433
but ones in which he was puzzled about whether it would sell well or not.

46:14.513 --> 46:16.275
Or just trying to determine how it's going to sell.

46:16.295 --> 46:16.675
Yes.

46:16.695 --> 46:23.782
But I mean, in a related way, the dust jacket is a similar thing, because it's your first look as a consumer at the book.

46:23.802 --> 46:24.122
That's right.

46:24.142 --> 46:30.308
If you don't know anything about it, if you're not going in to find it, it's going to be like a siren that calls you over to pick it up.

46:30.628 --> 46:30.768
I know.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.732
And if you do, then they've done their job, you know, and where do you go from there?

46:35.172 --> 46:36.353
But they don't want to do that.

46:36.434 --> 46:40.137
In fact, you pick it up, you find it's in impenetrable,

46:40.724 --> 46:43.587
But their responsibility ends at the first sentence.

46:43.667 --> 46:50.533
I mean, I think if they get you to the first sentence, they know the job.

46:50.553 --> 47:04.425
And she also, if ever we wanted an author, if an author was particularly interested, as some of our authors were, obviously in marketing, she was always happy to have a, I had many, many conversations with her, with the author there.

47:05.546 --> 47:06.667
That's wonderful.

47:06.747 --> 47:07.508
Of the book.

47:07.888 --> 47:10.731
It was wonderful for the author and the editor.

47:11.065 --> 47:18.516
And she really was so good at that, and she would ask questions to try to bring out the size.

47:18.977 --> 47:25.788
I mean, how many people are interested in money, prices, and farms changed in 14th century past?

47:25.808 --> 47:36.364
You know, she'd find out whether there was an association of people interested in that, and she would get a lot of information directly from the author for

47:37.002 --> 47:41.968
direct marketing to the people who might be most likely to buy the book.

47:41.988 --> 47:52.520
And you said that you were here, essentially the first words that you used in our conversation here, that you were kind of present at a time when the press went through the sea change.

47:53.180 --> 48:00.909
And I wonder if you could just describe that sea change for me, and how you perceived it, and what you saw, and how the press has changed.

48:02.251 --> 48:06.115
I guess that change and survival are all different aspects of that.

48:06.787 --> 48:10.031
Just your thoughts on that, I'd love to hear.

48:10.071 --> 48:13.496
People talked to you about Chester Kerr and the kind of person he was.

48:13.576 --> 48:18.222
Yes, and I'd love to hear your thoughts, in fact.

48:18.262 --> 48:23.368
Well, he was a very active director, active in all departments.

48:24.410 --> 48:32.099
And when I came to the press, as I say, we were in that building, and the editors had two or three offices.

48:32.139 --> 48:35.764
There were only four or five

48:35.913 --> 49:05.397
editors, I guess, and I don't remember too much about that, because that was really so long ago, but the first sign of the change for me was like a couple of months after I moved in, when we moved over to York Street, and we moved from this colonial, rather shabby, I don't know what it's like inside now, but it was rather shabby inside, and suddenly we're in these fancy quarters,

49:05.900 --> 49:07.742
with this facade.

49:07.762 --> 49:10.346
I don't know whether you've seen it on York Street.

49:11.708 --> 49:15.252
Very modern, and the offices were very nice.

49:15.392 --> 49:22.642
The editors had a whole separate area, and we were behind glass.

49:22.662 --> 49:34.978
We had offices in a row, and the, I don't know what he was called, editor-in-chief, or whatever he was called, David Horne,

49:35.718 --> 49:43.969
had a nice office with nice new furniture, so right away it was clear that something had changed in the press.

49:44.990 --> 49:57.786
And Chester was just interested in everything we did, and there was never the kind of pressure that kept you awake at night, worrying, how can I do so much work?

49:57.806 --> 50:02.232
But we all worked very hard, and I think it was

50:03.983 --> 50:12.996
Chester, we knew he was anxious to build up the press to become even more an institution of prestige.

50:13.396 --> 50:17.362
He was very active in the University Press Association.

50:18.043 --> 50:20.026
I'm sure he was president at one time.

50:21.027 --> 50:30.020
And I think we all kind of caught that spirit of becoming better than we were and bigger.

50:30.841 --> 50:33.585
And I guess the only reason we knew

50:34.814 --> 50:42.363
Or one of the reasons we knew was that there was more money available for more books.

50:42.383 --> 50:42.784
From where?

50:43.685 --> 50:44.226
From where?

50:45.227 --> 50:45.888
From Chester.

50:46.468 --> 50:48.391
From Chester.

50:48.531 --> 50:49.893
We didn't have anything.

50:50.073 --> 50:51.775
Well, I guess it was from The New Man.

50:53.177 --> 51:02.368
This was during the sixties when we were publishing The New Man, and getting slews of money for publishing that with, I guess, practically no expenses.

51:02.849 --> 51:03.910
I don't, I never

51:04.480 --> 51:08.525
That was a kind of separate operation, and I never had anything to do with it.

51:08.605 --> 51:33.458
But we were all aware that it was a thriving little industry in there, and it, as I say, I've heard that it financed the growth of the press so that if there was no question raised, if we had three books for one season and the next season we had five, nobody said, oh,

51:34.231 --> 51:35.753
We can't ever go through the books.

51:35.773 --> 51:37.616
And I think Chester set the figure.

51:37.676 --> 51:38.717
I think it was 50.

51:39.518 --> 51:41.922
Wanted to go up to 50 by some point.

51:41.982 --> 51:44.565
So we were all trying to meet that goal.

51:45.667 --> 51:50.013
I've heard it said, you know, charitably or not so good, that the press was Chester.

51:51.495 --> 51:53.357
Well, it was very much Chester.

51:53.377 --> 51:56.001
He really broke very little.

51:56.021 --> 52:02.149
Well, he was not a difficult person to work with, but he did want his own way.

52:02.690 --> 52:03.411
And...

52:03.880 --> 52:08.265
As editors, he very much respected editors.

52:08.826 --> 52:14.232
Now, I don't, he never, I guess almost never, read our books.

52:14.792 --> 52:16.514
Occasional art books, maybe.

52:16.554 --> 52:17.275
He never read the books?

52:17.796 --> 52:21.059
He didn't read our books, our manuscripts.

52:21.079 --> 52:23.582
I can't ever remember his reading a manuscript.

52:24.423 --> 52:24.643
No kidding.

52:24.663 --> 52:26.345
It didn't bother me at the time.

52:26.746 --> 52:32.352
He only did if it was, or if it got interested in a book, it was something like our

52:32.956 --> 52:33.977
Albers book.

52:34.217 --> 52:35.779
You know about the Albers book?

52:35.799 --> 52:35.859
Oh.

52:36.940 --> 52:40.384
Well, what was Albers' first name?

52:41.245 --> 52:41.886
How do you spell Albers?

52:41.906 --> 52:43.227
A-L-B-E-R-S.

52:43.247 --> 52:43.447
Okay.

52:44.689 --> 52:45.429
His first name.

52:45.550 --> 52:46.350
I can find that.

52:46.370 --> 52:46.811
Anyway.

52:46.851 --> 52:47.952
Albers design.

52:47.972 --> 53:02.608
Albers, um, um, was it in the Yale School of Art, Design, whatever they call it, and, um, he, um,

53:03.027 --> 53:09.896
was, how should I put it, his work that he's remembered for is a square.

53:10.678 --> 53:15.564
He did a lot of squares and colors, changed the colors.

53:15.584 --> 53:16.225
Not a cube.

53:16.906 --> 53:18.048
No, not a cube.

53:18.448 --> 53:19.890
With Albers, it was a square.

53:20.952 --> 53:28.502
And he's a very well, he was a very well-known artist.

53:28.883 --> 53:32.848
I don't know that he sold, not in the sense of selling paintings, but

53:33.233 --> 53:35.456
for what he did with the square.

53:35.496 --> 53:54.185
And at some point, late in his career, his students decided that we should put out a book, an Albert's book, which was a big production, because things had to be done exactly the way he wanted them.

53:54.225 --> 54:01.857
You couldn't just reproduce one of his paintings without his supervising and his student supervising.

54:02.056 --> 54:10.764
Well, that book really interested Chester, and I'm sure he saw every part of that book.

54:10.784 --> 54:17.810
And I guess when we published it, it was probably the most expensive book we had up to that time.

54:17.950 --> 54:21.634
I think, if I remember correctly, it was something like $200.

54:21.774 --> 54:22.034
Wow.

54:22.334 --> 54:25.417
And this was years ago when $200 was a lot of money.

54:27.539 --> 54:28.300
Was it a success?

54:28.880 --> 54:29.020
Pardon?

54:29.060 --> 54:29.881
Was it a success?

54:30.462 --> 54:32.063
I think it was a success.

54:33.342 --> 54:39.792
Yes, and I remember that there was pressure to reprint, and it was decided there was just no way you could reprint.

54:39.812 --> 54:40.433
Too expensive.

54:40.453 --> 54:42.516
Yeah, like California and that book with St.

54:42.657 --> 54:42.857
Gall.

54:43.037 --> 54:47.424
I mean, it was a triumph, but it was so expensive, it sold out instantly.

54:47.484 --> 54:50.329
But people said, we can't afford to print any more of them.

54:50.649 --> 54:54.836
And we couldn't have done it again to satisfy Albers and his students.

54:54.856 --> 55:00.244
I mean, it was a big chore to get that book just right.

55:00.764 --> 55:04.910
And that one, oh no, I didn't work on any art books.

55:05.692 --> 55:08.716
But Chester was very interested in that.

55:08.756 --> 55:18.351
He might, and he was very interested in certain authors, like Robert Dahl, and he was interested, he followed their books, and he wanted to be sure

55:18.972 --> 55:20.334
But things were done right.

55:20.354 --> 55:22.257
So he wasn't an editor, any kind of thing?

55:22.277 --> 55:25.582
Oh, I think he had been an editor once, but not an editor.

55:25.602 --> 55:33.253
So he knew the kinds of things that he wanted, but in terms of... And he was certainly not a scholar or interested.

55:33.274 --> 55:37.239
So was that troublesome, or was that helpful in some respects?

55:37.259 --> 55:41.085
I think I'd rather have a director who didn't read manuscripts than one who did.

55:42.768 --> 55:47.595
He gave us a lot of freedom, and as I say, he respected us.

55:48.183 --> 55:55.073
And very often, if we had a disagreement with some other department, he would take the editor's side.

55:55.413 --> 56:00.420
And at that time, the editor... What was it?

56:00.961 --> 56:03.845
We had to approve the design of the book.

56:04.966 --> 56:10.975
And if there was something we didn't like about it, our word would... It was very nice.

56:11.135 --> 56:13.538
Our word would carry great weight.

56:14.099 --> 56:16.823
But he, as I say, if it was...

56:17.528 --> 56:22.836
design versus editor, he felt pretty much the editor was right.

56:24.098 --> 56:27.162
And that changed when John Ryden came.

56:27.743 --> 56:35.194
I think he, the designer was usually right, and this was a little hard on us, but we survived it.

56:35.214 --> 56:38.579
John and John read manuscripts.

56:38.599 --> 56:39.100
Oh, yes.

56:39.761 --> 56:41.684
Not a great number, but he did.

56:41.704 --> 56:43.366
I knew what was going on.

56:43.386 --> 56:43.807
Oh, yes.

56:45.008 --> 56:45.409
He had a census.

56:46.030 --> 56:49.515
Oh, yes, but Chester was rather what you call large presence.

56:49.535 --> 57:01.793
I mean, not only was he physically large, but you, when he came in your office, you were well aware that Chester was there.

57:01.833 --> 57:07.641
Well, I'm a former naval officer, and we used to say, you know, does a captain have command presence?

57:07.661 --> 57:10.986
You know, instantly, who the captain is, without it being introduced to anybody in the room.

57:11.006 --> 57:13.590
I mean, certain people have that aura about

57:14.532 --> 57:18.437
They demand instant respect without having to utter a warrant, you know?

57:18.457 --> 57:19.939
And I think you're describing Chester.

57:20.480 --> 57:20.700
Yes.

57:21.682 --> 57:24.125
Well, I know he was a controversial person.

57:25.847 --> 57:33.698
Not to us, but when he became director, I think two editors, the head of the department, somebody else left.

57:33.938 --> 57:37.963
I mean, they didn't want Chester as director, and they were gone.

57:38.404 --> 57:41.468
And partly it could have been political, because the

57:42.106 --> 57:49.657
The fellow-elect went to Regnery, and he was quite conservative and anti-Russian, I remember, anti-communist, anti-Russian.

57:50.218 --> 57:52.581
Chester was a flaming liberal.

57:52.942 --> 57:53.623
Really?

57:53.643 --> 57:54.184
Oh, yes.

57:54.204 --> 57:55.746
At Yale, that's amazing, isn't it?

57:55.766 --> 57:57.909
Well, at Yale, no, it's not.

57:58.190 --> 58:09.987
The faculty, I think, tends to be liberal, at least in the fields, certainly in political science.

58:11.367 --> 58:15.451
I don't know about economics and law, certainly.

58:15.511 --> 58:17.233
And I don't know about other departments.

58:17.413 --> 58:26.383
So those are political differences, artistic differences, as I'd say in Hollywood, which occasioned the departure of these editors, right?

58:26.403 --> 58:27.444
Well, that's what you have to do.

58:28.405 --> 58:32.389
I mean, if you can't get along, you go on, I believe.

58:33.810 --> 58:36.413
He's head of the editorial department.

58:37.912 --> 58:43.137
As I say, I went to Regnery, which is a right-wing publicist.

58:43.158 --> 58:43.598
I know.

58:44.159 --> 58:45.800
I write for HarperCollins.

58:45.820 --> 58:48.683
I've done three books for them.

58:48.723 --> 58:55.030
But Regnery is, you know, I'm ever mindful of the fact that my checks are signed by Lubbock and Luddock, you know.

58:55.531 --> 58:56.211
Oh, really?

58:56.231 --> 58:57.953
Well, he owns HarperCollins.

58:57.973 --> 59:02.017
I never kept track of all that, but that's one way to tell.

59:02.137 --> 59:04.560
And my politics are decidedly different from

59:04.793 --> 59:10.020
But I don't write political books, and they do nice books.

59:10.040 --> 59:14.586
Well, I'm sure Chester was active, I think, in the Democratic Party.

59:14.646 --> 59:19.313
Maybe he wasn't.

59:19.333 --> 59:21.335
But he did things for the Democrats.

59:21.355 --> 59:34.513
And I remember when... ...publishing to be that visibly... And I remember his telling us that he had had a man to dinner, and several other people to dinner.

59:35.337 --> 59:42.784
named Carter, and he thought he was a good candidate for president.

59:42.804 --> 59:44.825
That's the first time I've heard his name, probably.

59:44.845 --> 59:50.811
The first time I ever heard of Jimmy Carter, but that's the kind of circle that Chester moved in.

59:50.891 --> 59:53.693
He was prescient there, wasn't he?

59:53.713 --> 59:55.375
Chris Carter since won a Nobel Prize.

59:55.415 --> 59:57.357
Fantastic.

59:58.017 --> 01:00:04.483
You've given me an hour of your time, and I don't want to overcompose on you, but if there was one

01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:07.794
Here I am embarking on this project.

01:00:08.296 --> 01:00:11.747
What would you like to see in a little monograph of Yale University Press?

01:00:11.827 --> 01:00:13.613
What would interest you?
