WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:15.477
This is a good start.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.819
I think we covered things.

00:17.300 --> 00:23.889
I think it's important to point out, you know, the librarians, we were talking about material in France that you thought was pulp.

00:24.430 --> 00:27.274
You mentioned Darton and his book.

00:27.294 --> 00:30.779
I think it was bestsellers and pulp types of things.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.181
A librarian doesn't make

00:33.005 --> 00:36.388
doesn't make choices on what's in the canon and what isn't.

00:36.569 --> 00:39.792
You don't really necessarily make qualitative decisions, do you?

00:40.473 --> 00:41.554
Well, I'm not a librarian.

00:42.295 --> 00:47.560
I understand that, but I mean librarians and libraries, maybe, is what I'm saying.

00:47.660 --> 00:52.966
I know you're not a librarian, but you head up a library, certainly.

00:56.109 --> 00:57.270
But answer that any way you want.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.193
There's one thing that they're missing.

01:07.160 --> 01:19.114
Oh, this is great.

01:22.258 --> 01:23.059
This is terrific.

01:23.539 --> 01:24.300
That's important.

01:24.340 --> 01:25.402
You're not a librarian.

01:25.622 --> 01:27.003
Why don't you just follow that a bit?

01:28.665 --> 01:33.471
I mean, it's easy for someone to assume that you are because you are the president and the chief.

01:33.873 --> 02:03.390
officer of the uh right well the one of the interesting things about this the people who attended the summit 50 let's say and fully half of us were not librarians professional librarians three were poets and i'll give you the speech that has all this too because it sort of breaks it there were p the charlie purse at the morgan has a phd in english does the english 18th century as i do the french 18th century billington is an historian um

02:04.163 --> 02:19.406
You know, there were ethnographers, philosophers, career civil servants, historians, medievalists, all kinds of different people that have taken over the running of the World's Great Libraries, in part.

02:19.426 --> 02:20.507
Very significant, isn't it?

02:21.128 --> 02:21.669
Fascinating.

02:22.250 --> 02:22.831
Fascinating.

02:23.612 --> 02:25.094
And... Sorry.

02:25.555 --> 02:26.116
It's okay.

02:26.136 --> 02:26.957
I had no thought of it.

02:26.977 --> 02:31.364
And can we also have the speech that I did the evening of the summit, the dinner speech?

02:32.545 --> 02:33.347
Okay.

02:33.507 --> 02:33.647
On...

02:34.454 --> 02:36.656
who we are as a group of library leaders.

02:36.816 --> 02:37.437
Remember that speech?

02:39.879 --> 02:42.522
This is—what's your first name?

02:42.662 --> 02:42.982
Elaine.

02:43.923 --> 02:46.606
Cunningham, right?

02:46.626 --> 02:46.986
Cunningham, right.

02:47.006 --> 02:50.109
This is the—okay.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.611
This is the one about the— Oh, great.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.212
Oh, excellent.

02:53.232 --> 02:53.913
Oh, great.

02:53.933 --> 03:02.841
It turned out that this Jesuit des Hôtels was also a French-Canadian ancestry and was a scholar himself in the French

03:04.205 --> 03:12.175
So, you know, I kind of found my roots and my identity by using him as a prison in some ways.

03:12.455 --> 03:14.137
It's a complicated story there.

03:14.618 --> 03:18.302
This is David Lemmick's piece, the main reading room.

03:19.224 --> 03:21.987
These are two more profiles.

03:22.127 --> 03:32.440
One, this is the news story when I was at 20, that's the profile, and then this is the more recent profile that was done.

03:34.512 --> 03:35.814
Oh, this is great.

03:35.834 --> 03:36.355
Where were we?

03:36.375 --> 03:40.781
We were talking about these people who came here from the summit.

03:40.802 --> 03:41.002
Oh, yeah.

03:42.224 --> 03:44.086
And you say it's a fascinating development.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.771
Well, but I don't know.

03:47.251 --> 03:57.567
Maybe development is the wrong word because Lesson was the head of the library.

03:57.747 --> 04:01.633
Goethe had the great library in Weimar reporting to him.

04:02.339 --> 04:04.482
Lessing, Doris, you mean?

04:04.502 --> 04:06.986
No, Lessing, the German playwright.

04:07.226 --> 04:08.909
No, no, no.

04:11.934 --> 04:15.920
I'm thinking of literary librarians, you see, people like Borges.

04:15.940 --> 04:16.881
Well, Borges, right.

04:17.782 --> 04:21.508
Well, the man in Argentina now is a poet who heads the library there.

04:21.568 --> 04:27.738
The head of the National Library of Brazil until two weeks ago was a poet.

04:27.758 --> 04:30.642
He was just sacked because he refused to have one of his people

04:31.162 --> 04:34.927
recant something she had said negatively about the government.

04:34.947 --> 04:37.049
The head of the National Library of Spain was a poet.

04:37.089 --> 04:40.754
He was just deposed with the change of government in Spain.

04:41.775 --> 04:44.618
Gerta, Lessing, who else did you think of?

04:45.940 --> 04:47.462
That's great.

04:51.827 --> 04:52.548
Well, think about it.

04:53.929 --> 04:56.072
If any pop up, jot them down, maybe.

05:00.035 --> 05:00.996
Okay.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.500
No, but don't stray from that, because you wanted something.

05:03.520 --> 05:15.697
No, I think that the management of libraries is within the research library and university library community.

05:16.559 --> 05:21.165
It is frequently put into the hands of non-librarians.

05:22.547 --> 05:24.009
Is that good?

05:24.049 --> 05:25.151
It doesn't seem to be bad.

05:25.932 --> 05:27.915
I mean, these places are flourishing, I think.

05:28.520 --> 05:46.243
In part, it's a function of the kinds of jobs that we have, because we're an interface between the library and those sectors of the public that we need to support the library, political and philanthropic, as is the case here specifically in New York for me.

05:46.263 --> 05:57.497
And the library has been choosing a series of presidents who come out of academic backgrounds with substantial administrative experience in running big, complex organizations.

05:58.051 --> 06:10.108
that have, and people here at the New York Public, at least, who have a tradition of personal scholarship as well.

06:10.128 --> 06:27.433
And I think that's a, well, these jobs as I see them require people who are kind of multidimensional, who can,

06:28.173 --> 06:46.485
who passionately believe in the value of books and scholarship and have done it themselves and written books on the one hand, but people who can negotiate with city government and people who can be successful in raising very, very substantial amounts of private sector support to run the library.

06:46.853 --> 06:51.118
Most people don't know that the research libraries in the New York Public Library are private libraries.

06:51.138 --> 06:53.160
I say that in here.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.382
I say it all the time.

06:55.603 --> 06:58.766
The New York Public Library is public only in spirit.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.147
That's right.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.108
It's a private library.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.852
And the fact that you embrace everyone, everyone's welcome.

07:03.892 --> 07:04.292
That's right.

07:04.332 --> 07:08.417
But the funding is totally outside of the realm of the city government.

07:08.437 --> 07:12.942
We have to raise $600,000 a week to run this place.

07:13.502 --> 07:14.684
That's not to build the endowment.

07:14.704 --> 07:15.765
That's for operations.

07:15.785 --> 07:15.865
Wow.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.153
That's $30 million a year that we have to bring in.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.254
Staggering amount of money.

07:21.095 --> 07:28.626
And the BPL, I think, is... They're, I think, moving more into private sector support.

07:29.206 --> 07:39.220
So the president here has to be able to carry on a nice conversation over dinner with a donor or potential donor.

07:39.605 --> 07:40.846
Thanks, Elaine.

07:41.027 --> 07:46.473
This is really a test to see if my files are... Elaine, I'm sorry.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.775
I apologize.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.156
Okay, so this is Paris.

07:49.417 --> 07:50.858
I promise, that's it.

07:51.119 --> 07:53.461
Is that what you want to call it?

07:53.481 --> 07:53.862
Perfect.

07:54.062 --> 07:54.443
Okay.

07:54.463 --> 07:56.265
Perfect.

08:02.492 --> 08:04.394
These are all brief speeches, as you'll see.

08:08.019 --> 08:09.240
And by the way...

08:09.693 --> 08:34.232
any quote whatever quotes I use in this book I'll run by you I'd like to get it right and give you a chance to there won't be any surprises right and that keeps me in good stead and that's why I haven't had any complaints on this book wonderful book thank you you know it's almost noon and I know you've got a

08:34.533 --> 08:37.101
Is there anything that I haven't done with?

08:37.121 --> 08:38.485
No, you've really done with.

08:38.565 --> 08:40.149
This has been wonderful.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.213
Please come back to see me.

08:41.273 --> 08:41.814
I'd like to.

08:41.895 --> 08:45.505
I'm a great admirer of yours.
