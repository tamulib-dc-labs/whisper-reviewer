00:02.022 --> 00:02.743
Okay.

00:04.184 --> 00:08.768
You were saying about, I asked you about the people that, you know, the genuine article.

00:08.788 --> 00:11.191
I've known about 30 of the old gunfighters and outlaws.

00:11.671 --> 00:13.613
Known who have talked to them, seen them shoot.

00:14.634 --> 00:18.157
In many cases, sat for hours with some of them.

00:18.197 --> 00:19.458
Any famous ones?

00:19.739 --> 00:22.802
Well, Bill Tillman taught me how to use a gun.

00:23.642 --> 00:25.544
He was one of the famous frontier marshals.

00:25.965 --> 00:28.006
He was marshal of Dodge City at one time.

00:28.807 --> 00:31.810
And Chris Madsen and Heck Thomas wiped out the Doolin-Dallin Gang.

00:32.178 --> 00:35.862
You went in search of these fellows?

00:35.882 --> 00:47.395
No, he was a friend of my brother's, and we were having dinner together one time, and my brother and I were both interested, so he took us down the North Canadian River Bottoms and showed us how it was done.

00:48.616 --> 00:54.743
Then I worked Bailey Hay one summer with Tom Pickett, who used to ride with Billy the Kid.

00:55.499 --> 01:01.706
and he'd been arrested with Billy, he'd been shot, wounded in gunfights that Billy was also in.

01:02.447 --> 01:06.071
He also was in the Town of Basin War.

01:06.131 --> 01:10.176
The expression was never used in those days, but he was what the movies call a hired gun.

01:10.757 --> 01:15.022
That's a recent expression.

01:15.042 --> 01:20.889
But he was hired as what they called a warrior in those days, a fighting man.

01:20.929 --> 01:25.354
Do these real-life people work their way as characters into your books?

01:25.469 --> 01:29.193
not they themselves, but they contributed to a number of characters.

01:32.517 --> 01:37.143
Okay, now they're probably being published in cloth now as well as back then.

01:37.163 --> 01:41.188
Is that something that pleases you or does this open up another market or?

01:41.568 --> 01:46.814
Oh yes, it opens up another market and it does please me because the books are in more lasting form.

01:47.595 --> 01:49.477
But it's the story is the main thing.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.461
How about who do you like to read?

01:52.501 --> 01:54.143
Do you have time to read other authors?

01:54.899 --> 01:56.040
Only research material.

01:56.621 --> 01:57.703
You don't read other authors?

01:57.723 --> 01:58.383
Once in a while.

01:58.824 --> 02:00.907
Once in a while I do, and I'm on a trip like this.

02:01.668 --> 02:03.630
I'm reading a detective story now.

02:04.551 --> 02:13.883
How about, you had some comments about the novelists of today in general, but I gather you don't think very highly of them.

02:14.004 --> 02:14.384
I don't.

02:14.424 --> 02:22.054
A lot of them, I think, have lost the fact that they're storytellers.

02:22.591 --> 02:25.594
Part of that, I think, is an outgrowth of what happened in the 1930s.

02:25.654 --> 02:30.498
There was a period then when everybody had to be selling a bill of goods.

02:31.779 --> 02:36.924
If you can't write about something to advance the cause of the working man, you're nobody.

02:37.544 --> 02:38.545
You're wasting your time.

02:39.366 --> 02:44.270
And so everybody got the idea that he was writing a cause.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.451
You were selling a bill of goods.

02:45.471 --> 02:47.273
You were convincing somebody of something.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.015
You had to be writing about something.

02:49.675 --> 02:50.556
This is a lot of crap.

02:50.975 --> 02:52.678
A good writer writes a good story.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.123
Shakespeare just wrote a good play.

02:56.624 --> 02:58.627
So he wasn't trying to convince anybody about anything.

02:58.687 --> 03:00.370
He didn't even try to publish his own play.

03:00.410 --> 03:01.392
That's right.

03:01.412 --> 03:03.074
No, he didn't.

03:04.236 --> 03:10.346
See, I think I've asked you everything I want, and I'll give you a little time to rest his room.

03:10.607 --> 03:15.755
The Shadow Riders, which is Louie's next novel, will be two things that happen.

03:15.775 --> 03:17.758
One, it's going to be published by Van

03:22.193 --> 03:37.649
So it's been a good ride for you then, huh?

03:37.669 --> 03:37.929
Yeah.

03:39.671 --> 03:40.131
Enjoyed it.

03:40.191 --> 03:41.773
I mean, is there anything you'd change?

03:42.113 --> 03:44.456
If you had to do it again, do it the same way?

03:44.496 --> 03:45.637
Oh, there always is.

03:46.257 --> 03:47.519
There always is.

03:47.539 --> 03:49.401
But you have to stop something or anything.

03:49.421 --> 03:49.821
Keep changing.

03:50.459 --> 03:52.321
You said when you were 15 you were hungry.

03:52.381 --> 03:53.582
Are you still hungry at all?

03:55.624 --> 03:57.125
You're only for more books, more time.

03:57.145 --> 03:59.527
Time is the thing I need now.

03:59.547 --> 04:03.371
Time is the one thing that's most essential and is the hardest to come by.

04:04.271 --> 04:05.633
It's one thing nobody can give you.

04:05.653 --> 04:06.453
It's quite a shelf.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.415
Quite a shelf of books you've got.

04:08.595 --> 04:09.796
Yeah.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.859
But I've still got a lot of books I want to write.

04:12.879 --> 04:16.462
I haven't even begun to scratch the surface to tell you the truth.

04:16.482 --> 04:18.424
And I've...

04:18.995 --> 04:23.620
At this particular moment, I have 34 books in some stage of writing.

04:23.640 --> 04:23.820
Jeez.

04:25.903 --> 04:29.186
If I get one line on paper, I've got it.

04:29.206 --> 04:33.391
And some of these are half-written, some are two-third-written, some are only three paragraphs.

04:34.672 --> 04:39.337
I have some book board in my study and a whole bunch of books.

04:39.357 --> 04:43.722
You've got an 8,000-volume library, mainly a research library?

04:43.742 --> 04:44.783
Yes, it runs a little better than that.

04:45.725 --> 04:48.108
That's a hell of a big library.

04:48.128 --> 04:48.388
Yes, it is.

04:48.408 --> 04:50.010
I thought mine was big at 2,000 times.

04:50.210 --> 04:55.275
Well, these are carefully selected books, too.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.259
Books I refer to again and again.

04:58.279 --> 05:00.601
I'm doing different parts of the country.

05:00.621 --> 05:04.946
They're basic stuff from Tennessee and Kentucky and Virginia and Maine and whatnot.

05:06.147 --> 05:07.909
I added at least 100 books on this trip.

05:08.770 --> 05:08.970
Wow.

05:09.551 --> 05:11.293
Probably up in Canada and probably down here.

05:12.286 --> 05:13.448
One last question.

05:13.728 --> 05:16.031
Do you identify with these characters?

05:16.232 --> 05:18.895
Do you feel like you're one of them?

05:18.915 --> 05:19.356
Oh, yeah.

05:19.857 --> 05:23.902
Remember Kissinger said that he felt like the gunfighter riding into town.

05:25.064 --> 05:26.426
That was the power of that.

05:26.666 --> 05:28.949
Do you feel like the gunfighter riding into town?

05:28.969 --> 05:34.177
No, I don't feel like that, although I have to get inside of it to tell your story properly.

05:35.859 --> 05:37.922
Some of my best stories are told in first person.

05:38.982 --> 05:42.210
You have to know how somebody reacts or feels.

05:43.052 --> 05:49.066
Of course, I've done some shooting, and I've done a lot of fighting, so I know pretty much what they feel like.

05:49.086 --> 05:51.692
Well, I'm going to wrap it at that, and thank you.
