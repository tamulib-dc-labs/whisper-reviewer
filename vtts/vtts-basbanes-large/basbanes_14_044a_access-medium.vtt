WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:05.269
I'm sorry, you're telling me about your birthday.

00:05.289 --> 00:11.656
Yes, well, my birthday falls in August, and we come up here every August, and usually George gets here before I do.

00:11.736 --> 00:24.491
Usually he can take a little bit more time off work, and so every year there's some interesting book waiting for me, usually from Titicombs, sometimes from some of the other used bookstores.

00:25.413 --> 00:27.395
Isaiah Thomas is another one we like.

00:27.855 --> 00:29.117
This one is from Titicombs.

00:29.137 --> 00:30.038
I love all my places.

00:30.153 --> 00:36.399
Yeah, actually, a few years ago, The Birthday Present was your book, and I read the first 200 pages of it in that house.

00:37.701 --> 00:39.863
I remember writing in the back of it.

00:39.923 --> 00:45.649
But this year, when I arrived, this one was waiting for me, which he got at Titicombs.

00:46.670 --> 00:56.580
And I have a couple of other books by Stevenson, but I had heard about this one, but I had never seen it or read it.

00:56.901 --> 00:59.063
And so it was very exciting to...

00:59.431 --> 01:03.495
unwrap it and add this to the odd shelf.

01:04.056 --> 01:14.928
It's a particularly important book in the history of the Arctic because his main thesis, as you can see from the title, it's about five and a half years he spent living off the land in the Arctic.

01:15.368 --> 01:28.763
And he was really the first person who described the polar regions as not being a kind of terrible ordeal that you had to be a sort of macho hero in order to penetrate.

01:29.300 --> 01:34.167
He felt that the Arctic was a friendly place with plenty of game.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.130
You could travel during the winter.

01:36.170 --> 01:42.079
You didn't have to hold yourself up all winter and then burst out for a few light months.

01:42.460 --> 01:50.331
He felt that the Arctic was a place that you could simply live in for years, and he was the first non-Eskimo to do so.

01:51.152 --> 01:58.243
So it's a very interesting attitude, all of his predecessors, of course.

01:58.477 --> 02:01.422
talked about the Arctic as if it were an enemy.

02:01.962 --> 02:05.188
And they were the macho hero who was about to conquer the enemy.

02:05.208 --> 02:09.114
And he was the first one who... The ownership stamp of George E. Mann.

02:09.134 --> 02:10.456
Yes.

02:10.476 --> 02:17.727
Of course, the sad thing about buying used books like this is that one always wonders, how do they happen to pass out of the family?

02:17.848 --> 02:20.492
And, you know, this is the first edition.

02:20.532 --> 02:22.114
Of course, there may have been only one edition.

02:22.154 --> 02:22.895
I'm not sure.

02:23.917 --> 02:25.159
But it's just...

02:25.443 --> 02:26.424
It seems sad.

02:26.764 --> 02:36.814
The only thing that's the saving grace about this particular book, you know from reading my book, the one thing that makes me saddest is finding an old book that's in excessively good condition.

02:36.954 --> 02:45.503
When I find one with uncut pages, it just breaks my heart to think that it has survived so long without anyone enjoying it.

02:45.823 --> 02:53.070
The nice thing about this is that you can see this as a book that's been well loved and will continue to be.

02:53.523 --> 03:13.881
My new book, the prologue, was basically with an uncut book that's been waiting for me for 84 years at the Athenaeum that I desperately needed while I'm finishing up Gentle Madness and I couldn't find it at Harvard and I couldn't find it at the BPL.

03:13.901 --> 03:18.746
I had been working off some Xerox copies.

03:19.546 --> 03:22.669
Bibliographical stuff, I had to get this and I wanted to get it in the bibliography.

03:23.290 --> 03:28.555
So I go to the Athenaeum, and there it is, and it's a prestige, true story.

03:28.575 --> 03:39.925
I'm checking them out, and not only are they uncut, but there's a card in the back, and it confirms that I'm the first person to ever take out these books.

03:39.945 --> 03:42.688
So I say, I don't know if you've ever read it, the Athenaeum.

03:42.948 --> 03:43.529
Oh, yeah.

03:43.729 --> 03:44.229
Oh, it's fun.

03:44.249 --> 03:46.651
What a beautiful, what a beautiful reading room.

03:46.671 --> 03:49.154
So I say, 84 years.

03:49.674 --> 03:50.435
Wow.

03:50.895 --> 03:52.757
You wonder who they bought these books for?

03:53.277 --> 03:58.524
And the guy looks up at me, I'm blinking, and he says, we bought them for you, Mr. Raspain.

03:59.786 --> 04:01.308
Chris, what a wonderful answer.

04:01.328 --> 04:01.869
That's true.

04:01.889 --> 04:04.653
Well, I later found out they say that about once a week.

04:04.673 --> 04:06.735
But each time they say it, it's true.

04:07.096 --> 04:08.298
That's what a library is.

04:08.458 --> 04:12.143
They're saving the books for the very people who want and need them.

04:12.263 --> 04:14.546
Sometimes it's you, sometimes it's me, sometimes it's somebody else.

04:14.566 --> 04:16.769
But that's the wonderful thing about a library.

04:16.849 --> 04:22.457
But, you know, one of the issues I'm looking at, and you might even address yourself to this, is that you have libraries...

04:22.690 --> 04:30.641
Today, not just public libraries, but institutional libraries, the computer will tell you now how often a book is checked out.

04:30.781 --> 04:34.767
This book hasn't been used in five years at the University of Michigan.

04:34.787 --> 04:36.630
It's a candidate to be deaccessioned.

04:37.251 --> 04:44.140
Well, the whole question of deaccessioning, which of course was such a huge brouhaha in the San Francisco library.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.966
A major chapter of a new book.

04:47.986 --> 04:48.587
Oh, good.

04:48.607 --> 04:51.010
I'll be interested to read it.

04:51.277 --> 04:53.980
I think it's a crime.

04:54.000 --> 05:07.416
And, of course, people like you and me are much more interested in the very books... Oh, no, just go ahead, and then we can also walk around if you want in the background.

05:08.478 --> 05:19.731
I think that the reason it makes me so sad is that people like you and me are much more likely to want to check out a book that no one has read for 20 years, or maybe that no one has even cut the pages of in 84 years.

05:19.930 --> 05:22.494
Those are the books that fascinate me.

05:22.955 --> 05:29.926
Those are the books that I need to go to the library for instead of just borrowing them from a friend or going to the bookstore and buying a paper bag.

05:30.347 --> 05:37.218
Those are the ones that I can't find anywhere else, which is why I love secondhand bookstores, because you can find books there that you can't find elsewhere.

05:37.258 --> 05:45.752
For example, now I edit The American Scholar, and in my first essay from the column that I wrote for The Scholar, I talked about

05:45.952 --> 06:05.315
I was talking about Bates and Russell and Wallace and, you know, Bates and Wallace and Darwin, some of the 19th century national historians, and talked about taking out a book of Wallace's from a major university library.

06:05.335 --> 06:10.701
In fact, it was from the library at Stanford, and nobody had taken it out for, I don't know, I can't remember what the number of years was.

06:10.741 --> 06:11.642
It's in the column.

06:12.083 --> 06:15.587
But the sense of this incredible work

06:15.736 --> 06:19.640
Now, what if they had decided that they were going to deaccession it?

06:19.940 --> 06:27.907
And what if someone were studying 19th century natural history and exploration and didn't have the Meri archipelago to refer to?

06:27.947 --> 06:33.072
Or even, I think it's not just a matter of deaccessioning, but what is available?

06:33.433 --> 06:41.440
My second column for The Scholar I wrote on Charles Lamb, of course, is mentioned frequently in Ex Libris, and I decided I wanted to write a whole essay on him.

06:42.221 --> 06:44.443
He's one of my great heroes.

06:44.693 --> 06:56.755
When I went to my local Barnes & Noble to stock up, at first they said they had nothing by or about Lamb, not a single book, even though the superstores have, I think, over 300,000 titles.

06:57.456 --> 07:07.073
Then it turned out they had in the children's section, they had one copy of Tales from Shakespeare by Charles and Mary Lamb, but they had no biographies of Lamb and no other books of Lamb.

07:07.441 --> 07:10.525
I've never seen a good biography of Lamb.

07:10.665 --> 07:19.476
There's actually a really good one called... Pardon me for interrupting, but... Yeah, there's a really good one, Young Charles Lamb, by, oh, what's her name?

07:19.797 --> 07:21.238
Winifred, somebody rather.

07:21.298 --> 07:23.421
It's mentioned, Winifred Courtenay.

07:24.042 --> 07:28.708
And I think she probably had intended to write old Charles Lamb, but maybe she died first.

07:28.728 --> 07:30.991
I don't know, she was old, pretty old when she wrote it.

07:31.031 --> 07:33.634
It was probably about 15 years ago, and I don't think there was ever...

07:33.800 --> 07:34.741
a second volume.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.067
I think it's C-O-U-R-T-E-N-A-Y.

07:39.808 --> 07:44.935
In any case, I have a pretty big Charles Lamb library, but it was all from second-hand bookstores.

07:45.655 --> 07:52.645
I have about 10 books about Lamb that ranged in price from $250 to $795.

07:52.725 --> 07:56.770
It's so sad when

07:57.256 --> 08:09.291
Not only when you go into a place like The Strand or Titicombs or when I got essays of Eliot at Isaiah Thomas here in the Cape a few years ago, you go into a place like that and you ask if they have any lamb.

08:09.311 --> 08:10.413
And do they have lamb?

08:10.433 --> 08:11.694
They have a shelf of lamb.

08:12.035 --> 08:16.140
And you go into Barnes & Noble and they don't have anything.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.925
Because, of course, secondhand bookstores are full of the books that people don't want.

08:20.405 --> 08:24.090
It's a wonderful way of gauging what's out.

08:24.577 --> 08:27.521
Well, actually, there's a paradox here.

08:27.541 --> 08:32.569
They're full of books that most people don't want, but the people like us are desperate to find, I think.

08:32.849 --> 08:36.975
Yes, but of course, they only end up in the second-hand stores because somebody didn't want them.

08:36.995 --> 08:46.149
And when you see at this strand, there's just a bulging shelf of lamb and at Barnes & Noble down the street, there's nothing except for tales from Shakespeare.

08:46.209 --> 08:53.740
And I think that's why... I think it's related to the notion of deaccessioning that...

08:54.496 --> 09:10.233
I don't put a lot of states in popular states, and therefore the fact that people have actually wanted something in the last five years seems to me a completely irrelevant fact.

09:10.253 --> 09:18.782
It has absolutely nothing to do with whether the book should be either saved in a library or even stopped by Barnes & Noble, although in the latter case,

09:19.049 --> 09:23.153
There are certainly hard-nosed marketing decisions that must be made.

09:23.214 --> 09:26.717
I suppose one can't stop books that will be bought once every 20 years.

09:28.119 --> 09:38.510
But I do believe that books go through phases, and I also believe that they— Now, we're talking about the actual object, not so much the book as the title of the book.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.591
No, I think the titles also.

09:39.611 --> 09:43.015
I think that Lamb, who knows, may have a great renaissance.

09:44.142 --> 09:46.305
and then Barnes & Noble will sock him again.

09:46.365 --> 09:54.214
But, gosh, what if the Athenaeum— well, the Athenaeum, I think, probably doesn't be accession in the same way.

09:55.055 --> 10:09.071
What if other libraries looked in their computers and decided that LAMM was insufficiently checked out, as would very likely be the case, and got rid of its whole section of LAMM?

10:09.211 --> 10:12.495
Then you couldn't go to the library, and you couldn't go to Barnes & Noble.

10:12.695 --> 10:16.099
And what if you lived in a place that didn't have wonderful used bookstores?

10:16.419 --> 10:17.501
You'd be really stuck.

10:17.901 --> 10:25.290
My copy of Dibdin's Bibliomania was formerly the property of the Concord Public Library in Concord, you know?

10:25.430 --> 10:30.576
A lot of my books were formerly the copy that belonged to public libraries or schools.

10:30.776 --> 10:33.279
My Plutarch's Lives came from the Vineyard Haven.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.003
A beautiful, beautiful set.

10:36.023 --> 10:37.024
Apparently it had never been read.

10:37.685 --> 10:40.368
It's a little brown edition, you know, 1890s.

10:40.548 --> 10:42.330
Got it for 20 bucks.

10:42.530 --> 10:50.020
If you get over to the vineyard, you should go to Booked In East, a little bit.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.722
Cindy Meissner's store.

10:52.043 --> 10:55.848
Really, it's easily as big as that barn there.

10:56.148 --> 11:00.875
Which is full of, there's a lot of books in that barn.

11:00.895 --> 11:06.883
She has first dibs of stuff on the vineyard.

11:07.403 --> 11:08.946
They all come to him.

11:08.986 --> 11:10.508
The books really do come to him.

11:11.309 --> 11:14.054
It's really worth going into his store easily six times.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.536
Because there's a lot of new stuff.

11:15.556 --> 11:16.839
There's new stuff.

11:18.161 --> 11:21.346
I don't know if you know him or not, but he's quite a character.

11:21.366 --> 11:22.207
I like the story.

11:22.308 --> 11:26.534
For us, it's a little expensive, but there's great selections.

11:27.256 --> 11:28.818
Only lately it's been expensive.

11:28.858 --> 11:31.603
I've got some of my very best things there.

11:31.903 --> 11:34.187
He will take some books and put $200.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.148
inexplicably on them.

11:36.168 --> 11:37.870
I mean, these are five thousand books.

11:37.890 --> 11:47.403
But then you will find, you know, I just found Simmons' history of the Renaissance in Italy, all five volumes, the whole edition, 1883.

11:48.324 --> 11:52.749
In fact, it might even be, it might even have this stamp in it.

11:53.070 --> 11:59.578
But now this one is from Titicombs, but it was originally sold at this one and then came down to Titicombs.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.761
I must really have a hundred books from Titicombs

12:01.994 --> 12:10.186
I think that's probably where everybody down here... He has a couple of choice houses on the Cape.

12:10.206 --> 12:14.452
I see, and that's where people... I would say that's probably where it was bought new.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.074
1921, you think?

12:16.174 --> 12:18.377
That sans serif type would never be 1921.

12:18.517 --> 12:23.464
I don't think... Yeah, but this book is a 1921 edition.

12:23.564 --> 12:23.985
I just...

12:24.202 --> 12:26.465
This looks like a typography.

12:26.966 --> 12:28.769
Well, I'm going to check out the old corner books.

12:28.829 --> 12:30.331
It hasn't been there in years.

12:30.531 --> 12:34.197
But, of course, this could be something that had been bought there more recently.

12:34.257 --> 12:35.298
Who knows the history?

12:35.378 --> 12:36.620
See, that's why I love old books.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.466
One can start imagining how many hands has this been through.

12:40.867 --> 12:46.094
Was George E. Mann the only person who owned this?

12:46.735 --> 12:47.436
I'm going to let you know.

12:47.516 --> 12:53.365
I think that my history of the Renaissance in Italy might also have been owned by the same person.

12:53.800 --> 13:00.708
Well, the wonderful thing also about these old houses is books.

13:00.889 --> 13:07.437
I've been coming up with my husband to visit this house and this little one for about 15 years.

13:08.158 --> 13:10.200
And the best thing about it was the books.

13:11.181 --> 13:20.753
That is, there was still the original set of Beatrix Potter that he had read as a child and that now my children have read, a full set of Thornton Burgess.

13:21.020 --> 13:29.839
Oh, yes, there were wonderful old editions and turn of the century sets of Dickens and Trollope.

13:30.019 --> 13:40.581
In fact, when the house was sold to George's cousins, all the different members of the family came up and everybody got to pick one memento from the house to keep.

13:40.848 --> 13:45.493
And, of course, many people were choosing things that actually were something, you know, big oil paintings and so on.

13:45.553 --> 13:54.323
And George chose the set of Dickens simply because it was the one that he had grown up with and the child had remembered seeing on the shelves.

13:54.663 --> 13:57.607
It meant more to him than any other set of Dickens possibly could.

13:57.627 --> 13:59.809
And I remember him coming back that weekend.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.252
I had wondered, you know, what is he going to bring?

14:02.352 --> 14:05.536
What one thing in the house will come home to our place?

14:05.616 --> 14:07.838
And so now we have that.

14:07.858 --> 14:09.420
Did you meet George when you were at Harvard?

14:09.704 --> 14:15.152
No, although we were there at the same time and had mutual friends, but he was two years behind me.

14:15.733 --> 14:19.839
And so, although we took a lot of the same classes, he took them a year or two behind.

14:19.859 --> 14:24.446
So we have many common memories that we didn't share simultaneously.

14:24.466 --> 14:29.373
So I met him, actually, at Life magazine when I was a staff writer.

14:29.413 --> 14:31.236
Would you say reading?

14:31.336 --> 14:39.087
I mean, this is a silly question, having read the book, but did reading play a role in...

14:39.320 --> 14:40.361
making you a couple?

14:40.381 --> 14:42.164
Oh, a huge role.

14:42.264 --> 14:44.827
I can't imagine marrying anyone who wasn't a reader.

14:44.947 --> 15:04.151
But, of course, as soon as I walked into George's apartment and saw that there were books everywhere and that he had four-sealing bookcases, the place was a rather modest apartment, but it was clear that one of the reasons that everything he owned was modest was that he spent some money on books.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.694
Of course, I immediately knew that there was a kindred spirit.

15:07.062 --> 15:08.364
And we got to know each other.

15:08.384 --> 15:15.035
I was a staff writer at Life also, and one of our other staff writers had left, so we needed a new one.

15:15.055 --> 15:22.147
I asked her and heard of George and interviewed him, and it was definitely the best decision I ever made to hire him.

15:22.187 --> 15:28.096
But a lot of our early conversations were also about each other's writing.

15:28.577 --> 15:33.525
From the start, we've traded things back and forth that we've written,

15:34.012 --> 15:39.800
And in fact, one of the first pieces I remember working on after George came to life was one of my Arctic pieces.

15:39.820 --> 15:46.990
I guess I wrote two, I wrote three Arctic pieces, two early ones when I first knew George.

15:47.110 --> 15:50.395
One was about polar bears, and one was about musk oxen.

15:50.815 --> 15:55.161
In each case, life sent me up to the Arctic, and it were just fantastic experiences.

15:55.201 --> 15:59.307
And I remember sitting with George and having him read those things, read them over.

15:59.788 --> 16:00.829
We also had...

16:01.130 --> 16:08.158
mutual interest in the literature of suicide, which sounds like an extremely gloomy romantic bond.

16:08.698 --> 16:20.671
But I was working on a long piece for life about the right to die, and George was writing a book about suicide, which was published by Summit in 1991, called The Enigma of Suicide.

16:20.711 --> 16:25.416
So we read all the same books, and

16:26.560 --> 16:29.105
I spent many weekends editing his book on suicide.

16:29.125 --> 16:38.483
I'm not sure he could have found any other girlfriend who is conversant and interested and sort of met all the same folks in the field of suicide.

16:39.024 --> 16:46.459
But, of course, right from the start, it's been a tradition that we give each other books for birthdays, Christmases, and the...

16:46.861 --> 16:48.624
He hasn't inscribed this one yet.

16:49.004 --> 16:49.786
I'll make him do so.

16:50.046 --> 16:51.448
And so this was a birthday present?

16:51.648 --> 16:52.430
Yeah, I just got this.

16:52.510 --> 16:53.511
So the birthday is when?

16:54.273 --> 16:55.234
Oh, August 7th.

16:55.454 --> 16:57.417
I turned 45, and this was the present.

16:57.498 --> 16:59.220
Today's my daughter's birthday.

16:59.240 --> 16:59.441
Oh, great.

17:00.142 --> 17:02.305
I came up here the day after my birthday.

17:02.345 --> 17:03.106
That's why I was asking.

17:03.126 --> 17:06.231
Yeah, I got it on August 8th, but I had just turned 45.

17:06.692 --> 17:11.199
And so he hasn't inscribed this one yet.

17:11.279 --> 17:13.122
But, of course, looking at the inscriptions...

17:13.760 --> 17:21.233
provides a kind of history of the relationship from the first one that I talked about in my book to a new friend.

17:21.313 --> 17:28.285
I mean, talk about a diffident and noncommittal inscription that could be to just about anyone.

17:28.766 --> 17:30.509
I like the idea of the common reader.

17:30.849 --> 17:37.421
In fact, that Virginia Woolf quote is something that I had already flagged, I have to say, to use it.

17:37.441 --> 17:38.282
And maybe you could just...

17:38.785 --> 17:39.947
Talk a little bit about that.

17:41.068 --> 17:42.911
And also in terms of the column, too.

17:42.931 --> 17:43.231
Yes.

17:43.332 --> 17:46.456
Virginia Woolf, of course, felt that she was a common reader.

17:46.496 --> 17:49.841
And she certainly wasn't.

17:49.881 --> 17:52.805
I think that was a piece of pure false modesty.

17:53.085 --> 17:56.290
She took the phrase actually from Samuel Johnson's Life of Grey.

17:58.193 --> 18:05.383
But the common reader as a phrase originally pioneered by Johnson and taken over by her...

18:05.785 --> 18:15.617
described the non-scholarly, intelligent but ordinary Joe who simply likes books.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.700
And she felt that that was what she was.

18:18.800 --> 18:32.957
And when she wrote the essays for her common reader and then the second common reader, she, I think, with false self-deprecation, was saying, I am simply writing these essays about books

18:33.106 --> 18:49.321
from the point of view of an ordinary reader who likes to read, not someone who brings any special academic qualifications, not someone who brings any particular brilliance to the act of reading, but simply someone whose life is furnished by books.

18:50.543 --> 18:57.289
And when I read that, I thought, well, what an interesting statement.

18:57.329 --> 19:00.212
If there was ever an uncommon reader, it's Virginia Woolf.

19:00.772 --> 19:01.493
However,

19:02.063 --> 19:10.357
There are many of us who really are common readers by just the definition that she made in her introduction to the first common reader.

19:11.619 --> 19:17.909
We are people who don't bring anything special to our reading except our love of it.

19:18.951 --> 19:23.498
It permeates our lives, and yet we have no special qualifications.

19:23.731 --> 19:34.324
And it becomes a circle, because the more we read, the more we love reading, and therefore the better qualified we are for that position of common reader by Woolf's definition.

19:34.444 --> 19:37.148
You know who else used that quote, precise quote?

19:37.388 --> 19:40.752
I did an interview with Alfred Kays in just six months.

19:40.772 --> 19:43.956
And he said, like Virginia Woolf, I am a common reader.

19:44.437 --> 19:45.358
I have to show you.

19:45.378 --> 19:46.579
Let me just bring you up.

19:46.599 --> 19:48.882
By the way, do you want some coffee or ice water or anything like that?

19:49.203 --> 19:51.966
We have water that we get from a snack.

19:52.621 --> 20:16.308
Just to finish the common reader stuff, when I was starting to write my column for Civilization and thinking about what I wanted to call it and wanting to write a column about reading, I decided that for Virginia Woolford it was false modesty, but for me it was actually the truth.

20:16.328 --> 20:16.909
Great quote.

20:16.929 --> 20:20.012
You'll see that quote again.

20:20.144 --> 20:27.681
And then, of course, the question came when I wanted to put these together into a book, and I always knew that they were going to be a book right from the start.

20:27.982 --> 20:30.809
That's why all the essays have the same characters.

20:31.089 --> 20:38.406
It's really a series of linked essays, sort of my life through reading, and I always wanted them to be in a particular order and so on.

20:38.673 --> 20:43.058
Actually, you did write them in this order.

20:43.978 --> 20:47.022
The last two I switched, just because I didn't want to end with Gladstone.

20:47.082 --> 20:48.683
It seemed sort of too specialized.

20:48.763 --> 20:51.646
I really envy you, though, the discovery of that book, by the way.

20:51.666 --> 20:54.209
Oh, and can you believe the book?

20:54.229 --> 20:54.930
I would have paid anything.

20:55.510 --> 20:57.392
Fifteen bucks is all you could expect.

20:57.412 --> 20:57.592
Oh, no!

20:57.673 --> 21:00.295
I tell you, it is the most precious book in my library now.

21:00.315 --> 21:02.017
Yeah, I got that one up at Riverrun.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.900
But anyway...

21:05.032 --> 21:09.644
Then the question came, well, should we call the book The Common Reader?

21:09.684 --> 21:19.108
And I had a long conversation with Jonathan Delassi at FSG, and finally we both decided that people who had not read the original book

21:19.409 --> 21:28.990
Wolf quotation, but just knew that she had called one of her books that, might think that I was somehow setting myself up as, in some way, Virginia Woolf's equal.

21:29.552 --> 21:36.628
And so we decided that people, reviewers would make invidious comparisons between me and Virginia Woolf with very good reasons.

21:36.648 --> 21:38.211
Actually, this is wonderful.

21:38.191 --> 21:43.178
Well, I love Ex Libris, too, and also being able to find a book plate for the cover.

21:43.399 --> 21:45.622
But speaking of Kazin and reading, I wish I could give you this.

21:45.682 --> 21:53.334
Unfortunately, I just have one copy up here, and when we promised it to my husband's cousins who were taking this out after we're here, but this is my second issue.

21:53.955 --> 21:57.099
You have to talk about that, too, okay?

21:57.119 --> 21:57.340
Sure.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.443
I just wanted to show you this, because we were talking about Kazin.

21:59.783 --> 22:04.350
Kazin wrote the lead piece for my first issue, and I had a very...

22:04.786 --> 22:06.350
which is one of his last pieces.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.260
And then I had a very close epistolary relationship with him during his last year.

22:10.320 --> 22:20.587
And so for this little tribute, I excerpted some excerpts from his letters that he had written to me during the last year of his life.

22:20.627 --> 22:21.850
They're all about reading.

22:22.252 --> 22:25.557
And they're three of the most beautiful paragraphs about reading.

22:25.577 --> 22:26.599
I don't have to.

22:26.619 --> 22:27.760
I'll copy these next week.

22:27.941 --> 22:29.603
I'm going into Widener next week.

22:29.683 --> 22:30.845
Oh, they'll have it.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.307
Yeah, and they'll have the first issue, too.

22:32.327 --> 22:33.028
I know where they have it.

22:33.169 --> 22:33.910
It'll take a while.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.392
Okay, they'll have my first one, too.

22:35.412 --> 22:36.634
30 seconds to find it.

22:36.914 --> 22:39.758
It also, you can find these in Barnes & Noble and stuff like that.

22:39.799 --> 22:40.980
Actually, I've just subscribed.

22:41.301 --> 22:41.822
Oh, great.

22:41.882 --> 22:42.963
How wonderful.

22:42.983 --> 22:45.407
I don't know where they got my name, but they sent...

22:46.045 --> 22:46.888
Did I send a mailing?

22:46.988 --> 22:47.229
Yeah.

22:47.269 --> 22:48.011
Did you just get one?

22:48.191 --> 22:49.415
Just got it.

22:49.435 --> 22:52.123
Oh, this is the notorious mailing.

22:52.183 --> 22:57.118
I just had a big brouhaha with my circulation director who, because she was in a rush,

22:57.402 --> 23:00.486
sent that particular mailing to the printer without sending it to me.

23:00.806 --> 23:02.188
She named her misspelled.

23:02.349 --> 23:03.810
There are two comma flaws.

23:04.431 --> 23:05.613
Oh, yes.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.435
Phil Larkin is misspelled.

23:07.736 --> 23:09.458
Phil Levine is misspelled.

23:09.498 --> 23:11.280
There are two comma things.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.844
Well, you know my thing about proofreading.

23:13.944 --> 23:18.510
But I have to assume that you proofread this very well because there are a number in there.

23:18.830 --> 23:19.131
Oh, yes.

23:19.191 --> 23:19.711
We caught them.

23:19.872 --> 23:20.573
I mean, I'm hoping.

23:20.593 --> 23:24.938
No, that's the un-proofread galleys.

23:25.018 --> 23:26.180
No, I think we caught them all.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.021
I hope we did.

23:27.187 --> 23:35.821
But anyway, you know, that mailing, I'm glad, I hope that the other people who get the mailing do exactly what you did, which is not read it very carefully, but just describe.

23:36.021 --> 23:39.447
No, I knew I was interviewing you and I'd been following you.

23:39.467 --> 23:39.887
Well, thanks.

23:40.007 --> 23:42.251
Yeah, I think there's some stuff in it that you'll like.

23:42.271 --> 23:43.753
Put a hard time around the book.

23:43.773 --> 23:44.955
Nick Baker's on your board?

23:44.975 --> 23:45.396
Yeah.

23:45.817 --> 23:46.959
Yeah, a lot of bookie folks.

23:47.860 --> 23:48.541
Well, I've interviewed Nick.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.763
I'm interviewing you.

23:49.823 --> 23:51.366
I've interviewed Greg.

23:51.726 --> 23:54.190
Well, it's not bad.

23:54.997 --> 24:00.867
Anyway, these letters that Kazan wrote to me in the last year of his life were basically about reading.

24:00.907 --> 24:05.536
And let me just read you my favorite sentence.

24:05.636 --> 24:19.300
And one of them he was talking about, I mean, he knew he was dying at this time of prostate cancer, and there had been a terrible rainstorm, and he'd gotten home, and he was miserable, and he writes...

24:19.803 --> 24:35.322
Yesterday, sick at heart at the struggle with my 82-year-old body as I fought a violent cold rainstorm, I finally got home, picked up Hardy's poems, and read myself back to life, as it were, thanks to his gift for putting one back into the whole design of life and death.

24:36.263 --> 24:40.789
No false optimism there, but what bracing truth in the very wilt of the words.

24:41.570 --> 24:49.219
Now, reading this, particularly after his death, is moving for a variety of reasons, but one of the reasons it's most moving is

24:49.486 --> 24:53.752
is because who else would pick up Hardy for cheer?

24:53.792 --> 25:15.920
I mean, Hardy is the most pessimistic writer in history, and yet I think that Caden is the sort of man who would need to pick up someone whose work matched his own mood, yet whose words were beautiful, and if he needed to read himself back to life, that's exactly whom he would pick.

25:16.561 --> 25:18.784
And, oh, I tell you, when I got that letter from him, there was,

25:19.490 --> 25:20.451
Tears in my eyes.

25:20.471 --> 25:21.873
I knew he wasn't going to last long.

25:21.893 --> 25:22.734
I didn't know he was sick.

25:23.195 --> 25:25.998
I interviewed him right when that last book came out.

25:26.018 --> 25:27.320
You know, God, the American writer.

25:27.420 --> 25:28.221
Yeah.

25:28.422 --> 25:28.762
Great book.

25:29.843 --> 25:30.865
Isn't it a great book?

25:30.885 --> 25:31.325
Wonderful.

25:31.345 --> 25:32.867
I am so cranky.

25:33.768 --> 25:37.754
I told my wife, I said, this is why I've done a thousand interviews.

25:38.054 --> 25:40.377
You say, are you ever prepared to do it?

25:41.078 --> 25:43.381
Every interview I had ever done had prepared me.

25:43.581 --> 25:46.645
I mean, I read the thing carefully, prepared the interview.

25:46.665 --> 25:47.987
Oh, I'm sure you have.

25:48.047 --> 25:48.147
Yeah.

25:48.802 --> 25:53.594
He was picking up on every word, and really tough.

25:53.735 --> 25:55.399
But he was sick, and he wasn't feeling good.

25:55.519 --> 25:56.883
That's what it came down to.

25:56.903 --> 26:00.271
I mean, there was one little line where we were talking about Evan Wilson.

26:00.492 --> 26:04.903
It is interesting, I found that Wilson, when he was writing one of the Dency Scrolls,

26:05.221 --> 26:08.766
I felt it necessary to go to the cave, and I said then, to explore the cave.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.349
And he said, explore the cave?

26:10.369 --> 26:11.370
He said he was too fat.

26:11.390 --> 26:15.036
He said he couldn't explore anything.

26:15.256 --> 26:16.899
I said, I withdraw the word.

26:16.919 --> 26:21.365
I said, I didn't mean to say he explored the cave.

26:21.385 --> 26:22.347
I said, he went to absorb the envy.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.250
I said, he went on and on.

26:24.270 --> 26:28.817
And I said, I never said, I never said, I never said he explored the cave.

26:28.857 --> 26:31.701
Don't you dare say that in your piece.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.692
I didn't mean it.

26:33.872 --> 26:36.034
That's not what I meant, you know.

26:36.455 --> 26:40.019
Well, he could be cranky, but he was also just wonderful.

26:40.099 --> 26:47.808
And gosh, the incredible productivity of the last year of his life, where he wrote for us, he wrote for the New York Review of Books, he wrote for the New Republic.

26:48.088 --> 26:49.310
He even published a poem.

26:49.410 --> 26:50.852
Oh, beautiful stuff.

26:50.872 --> 26:51.613
Oh, wonderful stuff.

26:51.633 --> 26:53.395
Some of the best stuff he's done, I think.

26:53.475 --> 26:57.039
And was writing letters like these, wonderful letters to me and all kinds of people.

26:57.079 --> 26:59.742
In the Times obit, he died on his birthday, by the way.

26:59.782 --> 27:00.203
Oh, I know.

27:00.323 --> 27:02.245
As Shakespeare did, which is interesting.

27:02.714 --> 27:08.141
Except Shakespeare didn't get to his 83rd birthday.

27:08.962 --> 27:16.632
I remember my editor, Alan Peacock, called me and it happened to be on my 52nd birthday, which was in 95, and I was very upset.

27:16.652 --> 27:18.174
And he said, what are you upset about?

27:18.194 --> 27:20.737
He said, your book is coming out.

27:20.757 --> 27:22.239
And I said, Alan, you know who died?

27:22.319 --> 27:23.941
I said, here's my 52nd birthday.

27:23.981 --> 27:25.824
You know who died on his 52nd birthday?

27:25.864 --> 27:26.865
I said, Shakespeare.

27:27.014 --> 27:28.236
He died in his 50s.

27:28.256 --> 27:31.821
And I said, I'm still waiting for my first book to be published.

27:31.841 --> 27:34.044
He said, well, I get it now.

27:34.184 --> 27:37.509
It was what, 83?

27:37.609 --> 27:39.432
83.

27:40.433 --> 27:46.542
But we're talking about Wolf, Kazin also, people who are totally formed or shaped by the reading, I think.

27:46.606 --> 27:49.049
I mean, Wilk was never formally educated, right?

27:49.069 --> 27:53.134
Yes, I think some of the people who weren't formally educated, and of course Kazin was.

27:53.174 --> 27:55.937
He was, but he will tell you his independent reading, I think.

27:56.137 --> 27:57.579
Yes, oh, that's what did it.

27:57.839 --> 28:01.684
The reading in 315 at the New York Public Library.

28:01.744 --> 28:10.815
Oh, absolutely, that's what did it for him, which is why he was a very unconventional professor, because he hated academic interpretations of books.

28:10.835 --> 28:15.060
He felt that both the right and the left had ruined the...

28:15.817 --> 28:43.832
process of reading for love and consolation which he felt was the only way to have a relationship with the book he talks about in some of these letters here and he he felt that uh academic interpretations he hated theory he hated the application of politics uh to reading i mean he hated um he hated neoconservatives and post-modernists he wasn't pre or post anything he just wanted to read

28:44.217 --> 28:49.542
And I loved that view.

28:49.723 --> 28:51.204
And of course, I grew up in a household.

28:51.344 --> 28:57.991
I mean, my father went to Columbia, but he never even finished his master's there.

28:58.932 --> 29:08.181
And he had grown up in a household that had books, but mostly he found them on his own.

29:08.262 --> 29:11.225
And his relationship with literature was one that he developed himself.

29:11.265 --> 29:13.667
In fact, I remember him telling me that he

29:14.035 --> 29:30.150
He used to go to the local library in Brooklyn and get out books, and he would read one on the way home and one on the way back to the library, because why waste that mile of walking without reading?

29:30.210 --> 29:38.858
He said he got extremely good at reading while walking, stepping off the curb, still having the book in front of him.

29:39.398 --> 29:40.839
Macaulay used to do that, too.

29:40.859 --> 29:43.722
He used to read while he walked.

29:44.545 --> 29:58.865
I think maybe those are the readers who love reading most, the people who didn't discover books through any formal avenues, but I guess through the same kinds of avenues that we fall in love with people.

29:58.885 --> 30:05.173
I did an interview with Harold Bloom for this book, and I'm still getting his third hand.

30:05.213 --> 30:13.104
So Bloom is quoting Philip Roth, who was quoted in the Times, and Roth, of course, is a great reader.

30:13.124 --> 30:13.725
We all know that.

30:14.262 --> 30:21.229
But it's saying Kazin is probably the greatest reader of American literature of the 20th century.

30:21.249 --> 30:22.571
I would agree with that.

30:22.591 --> 30:23.271
Yeah.

30:23.331 --> 30:25.714
But going back, I found that very interesting.

30:26.655 --> 30:41.130
Bloom was quoting Roth as saying he believes there are probably no more than—and this is an explanation for why his books aren't best-selling—but there may be only 50,000 serious readers, either in the United States or in the world, either way.

30:41.228 --> 30:44.892
whatever the number is, do you agree with that basic premise?

30:44.932 --> 30:46.453
I don't know what a serious reader is.

30:46.494 --> 30:48.055
I don't even know if I'm a serious reader.

30:48.075 --> 30:51.779
I think maybe I'd ruin my love of my books if I felt that I was too serious.

30:51.819 --> 30:54.562
That's a great answer, yeah.

30:54.922 --> 30:55.783
Continue with it.

30:55.803 --> 31:00.809
Well, for example, Steve Smith, who was the founding editor of Civilization, now is the editor of U.S.

31:00.829 --> 31:04.012
News and World Report, who's the one who encouraged me to write this Come and Read a column.

31:04.813 --> 31:06.915
And he once said to me, you know, you should write

31:07.267 --> 31:08.869
a book about polar exploration.

31:09.569 --> 31:11.732
You know so much about it.

31:11.752 --> 31:12.673
You love it so much.

31:12.713 --> 31:13.794
It would be so much fun.

31:13.834 --> 31:17.998
And I said, well, I'm not sure that I want to become an official expert.

31:18.078 --> 31:25.306
I'm not sure that if that feeling of how knowing that you ought to do something ruins it for you.

31:25.326 --> 31:31.432
There are so many children, for example, who love to read until they start being assigned reading as homework.

31:31.872 --> 31:36.497
And I think that once you call yourself a serious reader, that sense of

31:36.629 --> 31:43.238
dilettantish exploration, which is part of the fun, just vanishes for you.

31:43.278 --> 31:52.951
I'd sort of like to leave my odd shelf something that is purely pleasurable that I'll never, you know, never make a profit out of.

31:52.971 --> 31:56.596
I mean, I may live to eat my words.

31:56.676 --> 32:03.565
There may be something that I'll get so interested in that I will decide I want to write a book about it, but serious readers.

32:03.950 --> 32:04.491
I don't know.

32:04.551 --> 32:12.519
You know, I looked at a demographic survey of the people who read The American Scholar, because I figured, gee, these must be serious readers, if anybody is.

32:12.539 --> 32:15.182
And it was interesting.

32:15.762 --> 32:16.563
They were readers.

32:17.284 --> 32:20.167
But whether serious is the right adjective, I'm not sure.

32:20.668 --> 32:23.551
Only about 15% of them were academics, for example.

32:23.991 --> 32:25.793
And many of them were people like me.

32:26.073 --> 32:28.176
There were a lot of journalists and writers.

32:28.436 --> 32:31.459
There were also a lot of physicians.

32:32.013 --> 32:46.067
lawyers, people who are in relatively specific professions that will not allow them a whole lot of really well-written reading during the course of their day, and who want to come home and read something that's well-written.

32:46.628 --> 32:47.749
Are there serious readers?

32:48.449 --> 32:48.850
I guess.

32:48.990 --> 32:53.274
I think they're just interested readers with a fairly long attention span.

32:54.756 --> 32:57.018
But I don't know how serious I wanted that.

32:58.860 --> 33:02.003
Even in my first book, I felt that

33:02.742 --> 33:08.128
One of the things that was a great advantage is that no one had ever put on that subject before.

33:08.608 --> 33:17.358
So although people had written things on tiny little, I mean, there was plenty to read, but no one had taken a look at the whole forest before.

33:17.398 --> 33:20.901
No one had even taken a look at an entire tree, maybe only individual leaves.

33:21.602 --> 33:28.550
And so I never had any fear of having to compete with a serious book on the same subject.

33:28.570 --> 33:29.030
It's a great feeling.

33:29.330 --> 33:30.792
It's a wonderful feeling.

33:31.075 --> 33:37.502
Now, when you wrote A Gentle Madness, of course, there had been much else written on book collecting, but no one else had all gotten it together in the same way.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.564
Didn't you feel that, in a sense, you were doing the first?

33:39.604 --> 33:42.307
Especially the living collectors.

33:42.327 --> 33:42.768
Oh, yes.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.390
That had not been done at all.

33:44.410 --> 33:53.860
I mean, the French stuff, the history, you know, my debt is the previous published books, but going out and finding the living ones, and that's where it.

33:54.363 --> 33:56.746
absolutely being a journalist comes in.

33:56.766 --> 33:57.046
Yes.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.850
And I'm proud to call myself a journalist.

34:00.251 --> 34:02.774
Perhaps by definition, journalists aren't very serious.

34:03.995 --> 34:06.619
But journalists have other good qualities.

34:06.719 --> 34:07.941
They tend to be quick studies.

34:08.101 --> 34:08.922
And storytellers.

34:09.122 --> 34:09.963
They're storytellers.

34:10.484 --> 34:11.705
They've done a lot of interviews.

34:13.007 --> 34:16.071
So I think they know how to ask questions and how to listen.

34:16.251 --> 34:21.959
And so for me, of course, having spent my whole career being the question asker, it's so much fun to be on the other end.

34:22.620 --> 34:23.020
I thought,

34:23.185 --> 34:26.830
Oh, gosh, when Nick Basbane is at home, he's writing down his questions.

34:27.050 --> 34:28.012
He has to prepare.

34:28.032 --> 34:31.136
I can go to the beach and get back at ten minutes to three.

34:31.516 --> 34:33.179
I don't have to prepare at all for this.

34:33.319 --> 34:35.081
It's lovely being on the other end.

34:35.522 --> 34:40.228
But I'm delighted to be a journalist, and I think will always think of myself.

34:40.489 --> 34:49.521
The fellow who reviewed my book for the New York Times described me as Mr. Basbane, a New England journalist.

34:49.541 --> 34:51.724
This is the explanation for the phrase that follows.

34:52.008 --> 34:53.891
has a taste for the eccentric.

34:53.931 --> 34:57.797
I guess the translation of that is I like good stories.

34:58.237 --> 35:01.863
I shouldn't take that as a rap.

35:02.524 --> 35:06.009
I would love to be told that I had a taste for the eccentric.

35:06.049 --> 35:11.017
In fact, I think my main problem is that I'm so uninterested in anything mainstream.

35:11.077 --> 35:16.345
I'm only interested in the little eddies on the side.

35:16.696 --> 35:24.105
I'm interested only in the eccentric, which is why I spent eight years writing a book about an epileptic, wrong child.

35:24.125 --> 35:27.629
We should talk a little bit about that, by the way, if you don't mind.

35:27.910 --> 35:28.090
Sure.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.932
I hope you don't mind our jumping around.

35:29.952 --> 35:31.134
Oh, no, no, that's the best way.

35:31.294 --> 35:32.035
That's the best way.

35:32.055 --> 35:38.603
I mean, you'll organize it when you write it, but I think that my favorite interviews are the ones that are sort of free-floating because they're...

35:38.819 --> 35:41.402
more like a real conversation than your real conversation.

35:41.422 --> 35:44.866
And if I don't really ask you questions about the book, I mean, it's because I've read it.

35:45.006 --> 35:45.526
Oh, sure.

35:45.647 --> 35:46.387
No, that's fine.

35:46.628 --> 35:47.228
That's fine.

35:47.829 --> 35:50.732
What would you like to know about Spirit Catch You?

35:50.752 --> 35:51.413
Well, just doing that.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.055
I mean, that was time for a departure, I guess.

35:53.135 --> 35:57.300
Not a departure, but certainly a professional departure.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.944
Well, any book would have been a departure for me because it was my first book.

36:01.044 --> 36:02.966
I had written only articles up to that point.

36:02.986 --> 36:07.611
So to do something that extended, of course, was going to be something new for me.

36:07.793 --> 36:12.640
I really wrote it by accident, having no intention of spending that long.

36:13.661 --> 36:15.464
I didn't realize it was eight years, by the way.

36:15.484 --> 36:16.605
Eight years, yeah.

36:16.705 --> 36:23.194
Well, I had two children in New Jersey during that time, so I had to make some money, so I did part of your freelancing.

36:24.036 --> 36:27.120
And also wrote some of these essays.

36:27.260 --> 36:30.444
Many of them were concurrent with the last few years of working on spirit.

36:32.087 --> 36:33.809
But I wrote it for The New Yorker.

36:33.849 --> 36:35.151
I wrote it for Bob Gottlieb.

36:35.620 --> 36:42.490
And it was a long New Yorker piece originally that he had commissioned, and he accepted it.

36:43.150 --> 36:45.654
But unfortunately, I turned it right before he left.

36:45.774 --> 36:49.820
So he was very lucky that he paid for it, but Tina Brown didn't run it.

36:49.840 --> 36:55.247
So then I was stuck with a 35,000-word thing that was too long for any other magazine, but too short for books.

36:55.267 --> 36:56.129
So what should I do with it?

36:56.149 --> 36:56.990
Boy, that's huge.

36:57.030 --> 36:57.250
Yeah.

36:57.991 --> 37:00.054
Those are the days of three-part series.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.439
I wonder if the David Remnick will reinstate those again.

37:03.479 --> 37:03.899
I hope so.

37:04.921 --> 37:05.121
All right.

37:05.506 --> 37:11.271
So it sat for about a year while I tried to get up the necessary energy to turn it into a book.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.373
I knew it would just be a hell of a lot of work.

37:13.413 --> 37:17.678
But I finally decided I couldn't let all that go to waste.

37:18.218 --> 37:24.104
And so I wrote to FSG, my first choice publishing house, and I was very fortunate that Jonathan Galassi wanted it.

37:24.684 --> 37:28.448
But when I started reporting it, of course, I had no idea it would be a book.

37:28.468 --> 37:29.569
I just thought it would be an article.

37:29.589 --> 37:35.074
And even the choice of subject, it was one of six ideas that I had

37:35.442 --> 37:36.664
pitched about Gottlieb.

37:37.164 --> 37:43.312
And I thought that there was another one of the six that I was sure he was going to pick, so I was just floored when he picked the one about the Hmong.

37:43.372 --> 37:45.836
I thought, oh, no, I don't know anything about the Hmong.

37:45.856 --> 37:47.157
I didn't even know how to pronounce the word.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.199
I'm going to make a fool of myself.

37:48.659 --> 37:53.305
But maybe that position of absolute ignorance helped me see the subject a little bit more freshly.

37:54.187 --> 37:55.669
Ignorance is always helpful that way.

37:56.510 --> 38:00.515
And so I was stuck with it for The New Yorker.

38:00.535 --> 38:02.918
I was interested in the subject.

38:03.168 --> 38:04.930
but I didn't know the first thing about it.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.874
My proposal was full of errors.

38:08.796 --> 38:10.238
I was just very fortunate.

38:10.298 --> 38:11.900
Proposals don't mean anything.

38:11.920 --> 38:16.606
I was very fortunate that Bob Gottlieb's ignorance was even more profound than my own.

38:16.886 --> 38:20.071
I've looked at the proposals for my two books, and I'm so embarrassed.

38:20.091 --> 38:22.754
I hope that they don't have a copy of it at the publisher.

38:23.155 --> 38:23.996
I'm sure they've forgotten them.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.318
There are errors in there.

38:25.338 --> 38:27.361
Well, you know, sometimes I show it, too.

38:27.841 --> 38:31.146
Sometimes when I give classes... Yeah, me too.

38:31.246 --> 38:32.888
But sometimes when I give classes...

38:33.138 --> 38:44.137
I'll show some of my proposals, including that one, to show these students that when they see the beautiful finished book, they somehow think that everything, our root, was to the same standard.

38:44.437 --> 38:47.443
And it can be so intimidating that they might not take the first step.

38:47.483 --> 38:52.692
And I want to show them that, like... Bring in a manuscript with all the little tags on it.

38:54.054 --> 38:54.795
Sometimes I do that.

38:54.855 --> 38:55.737
That's a book.

38:56.358 --> 38:56.839
Right.

38:56.859 --> 38:57.660
But like the...

38:58.163 --> 39:26.770
like toddlers learning how to walk there's so many tumbles along the way and i want to show them that i made plenty of mistakes and you know it was just as idiotic as they secretly fear they are but i had a wonderful time doing that book i think because it was so i think so different from the the kinds of reading that i had to do for it were completely different from the sorts of things that i normally read for pleasure whereas of course all the stuff for ex libris is all the stuff that i read anyway i mean i have my shelf

39:27.239 --> 39:31.685
books about books would exist whether or not I had written this column.

39:31.705 --> 39:40.656
I think that spirit really took me out of myself and my own world in a tremendously useful way.

39:40.716 --> 39:55.035
This sort of family that I grew up in and this sort of environment that I've always lived in is wonderful, but it can be a kind of claustrophobic hothouse because it's full of people exactly like me.

39:55.589 --> 39:59.857
I think that one's first book should not be an exercise in looking in a mirror.

39:59.937 --> 40:07.672
I always feel it's a mistake when people write a memoir as their first book with all these 30-year-olds, what do they have to remember?

40:07.892 --> 40:12.180
Well, George is writing a memoir now about this house, but it's not his first book.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.706
And it's about the house.

40:13.806 --> 40:14.907
And it's about the house, yes.

40:14.927 --> 40:18.510
Well, my second book, I consider Ex Libris to be kind of a memoir.

40:18.931 --> 40:21.253
Well, it really is, because it is a story about your family.

40:21.573 --> 40:22.514
It's a story about your marriage.

40:22.574 --> 40:23.835
It's a story about your children.

40:24.215 --> 40:27.698
And my life has been lived through books, and my life has been created by the books I read.

40:27.779 --> 40:31.222
But it would have been a mistake if I had done it first.

40:31.442 --> 40:40.530
I think first books should be a way to travel outside oneself, and I could never have found anybody more different from me than the Lee family.

40:40.949 --> 40:48.098
who also taught me so many things about how to be a good parent and much else.

40:49.059 --> 40:55.868
And the years that I spent among the Hmong, and also among the other culture in that book, it's really a book about two cultures, Hmong culture and medical culture.

40:55.908 --> 40:59.613
And medical culture, after all, started to seem as exotic as Hmong culture.

41:00.834 --> 41:10.787
But I think the time that I spent doing that book took me away from my own life

41:11.830 --> 41:36.572
and my own perspective just took me far enough outside the things that i was used to and enabled me to look back from a different perspective in a way that was incredibly fresh freshening for me um so it gave me i think even though i probably won't write another book about them long it wasn't as if i spent my

41:37.261 --> 41:40.925
I spent those eight years learning anything that was likely to be useful at a cocktail party.

41:40.985 --> 41:45.911
It was a private body of knowledge that this was sort of my own little secret interest.

41:46.371 --> 41:57.184
But it took me out of that excessively literary, excessively intellectual hothouse that I'd grown up in and that I'd been married into another one.

41:57.204 --> 42:03.471
And then I think as I came to the last few years of that,

42:03.873 --> 42:05.455
I was finishing up writing it.

42:05.475 --> 42:08.818
The last few years, concurrently, was writing most of the essays in this book.

42:08.958 --> 42:10.179
People think, gosh, how amazing.

42:10.199 --> 42:11.781
How did she do another book in only a year?

42:11.821 --> 42:13.722
It was actually that I was working on them concurrently.

42:14.423 --> 42:17.766
Every eight weeks, it would be time to write another essay.

42:17.786 --> 42:21.029
I used to take two weeks out of every eight.

42:21.610 --> 42:32.260
Leah's story was so sad that being able to turn from that terrible tragedy to something that was funny and bright and

42:32.527 --> 42:39.215
had a happy ending and where all the reading was stuff I'd already read and felt completely comfortable with.

42:39.396 --> 42:45.543
I felt I was floundering around in such a foreign culture, both Hmong and medical culture.

42:45.744 --> 42:50.470
At the beginning, I really didn't know enough medical vocabulary to be able to read Leah's chart accurately.

42:50.950 --> 42:52.632
So there were these two foreign languages.

42:52.652 --> 42:54.415
I sort of needed interpreters for both.

42:55.015 --> 43:00.222
And with Ex Libris, I was so much on home territory.

43:00.860 --> 43:23.475
The other thing worth mentioning, perhaps, I mean, not only was it a sort of pleasant juxtaposition of six months of tragedy and then two weeks of comedy, but I also had written very few essays before these, I think because the essay was my father's genre, and I think I had to pass 40 before I had the self-confidence

43:23.810 --> 43:32.903
to venture into a genre that I was really made for, but that I didn't want to do earlier because I didn't want to compete with someone that I knew I couldn't surpass.

43:33.464 --> 43:35.306
So I think I had... And competing in whose eyes?

43:35.867 --> 43:36.228
Mine.

43:36.608 --> 43:37.530
Certainly not his.

43:37.550 --> 43:45.761
I think that I had stayed with reportage because it was less intimidating.

43:45.862 --> 43:51.049
My mother was a reporter, but because she had done her major work before I was born,

43:51.316 --> 43:59.809
I didn't actually see her working when I was growing up, so her work was not intimidating to me in the same way that his was.

43:59.889 --> 44:01.171
I could actually see him write.

44:01.191 --> 44:05.217
I would literally see him holding his pencil, and then I would read the resulting essay.

44:05.677 --> 44:16.633
So I think I had to reach middle age before I could venture into what I felt was his territory and make it my own.

44:16.653 --> 44:20.479
You're answering questions that I had intended to ask, so that's very good.

44:20.739 --> 44:21.120
Thank you.

44:21.640 --> 44:30.273
I also feel that you did something very nice for your mother there as well when you mentioned John Hersey.

44:30.493 --> 44:33.838
Well, she's mentioned in a number of places.

44:33.858 --> 44:43.332
Let me just ask, was that essay mindfully written to pay respects to your mother's tribute for unattributed work?

44:44.333 --> 44:50.382
In a way, although I think that she doesn't particularly like to be written about.

44:50.564 --> 44:52.206
But yes, I did want to.

44:52.326 --> 44:57.192
I think her book, the one that she co-wrote with Teddy White, Thunder Out of China, is just a wonderful book.

44:57.813 --> 45:05.382
And it's still in print, and anybody interested in China should read it, and most do.

45:06.303 --> 45:16.676
My first book, which was a reportorial book about an Asian subject, was very much following in her footsteps, I would say, whereas the second one is more following in my father's footsteps.

45:17.356 --> 45:18.698
And people who felt that

45:19.184 --> 45:24.630
spirit came out of left field were probably people who knew only about my father and not about my mother.

45:24.730 --> 45:31.057
If you read my mother's work, spirit made perfect sense.

45:31.818 --> 45:39.506
But yes, I did want, I think, to give her her proper due when I wrote that piece about plagiarism.

45:39.606 --> 45:47.875
And her work is mentioned in a few of the other... I think that people who are less familiar with her work and who somehow imagine

45:48.277 --> 45:56.486
Me and my brother growing up in our father's household don't realize that, particularly in my case, the influence from my mother was at least as great.

45:56.886 --> 46:03.053
Because my father is this sort of writer who sits in a library and thinks, whereas my mother was a reporter.

46:03.073 --> 46:04.795
I say was.

46:04.855 --> 46:09.580
She's still alive, but was because she hasn't been a reporter for quite a long time, whereas my father is still working.

46:09.620 --> 46:13.744
But her work was always reportorial.

46:14.180 --> 46:19.127
I started off as a reporter, and probably if I write another book, it'll be another book of reportage.

46:20.168 --> 46:25.075
Essays also are a good thing to do when you have small children because you don't have to travel.

46:26.477 --> 46:31.624
It's sort of exploring more inner travel than external travel.

46:31.704 --> 46:36.711
But growing up with my mother, her tales of her...

46:37.163 --> 46:49.801
the kind of journalistic writing that she did in her reportage, I think, fed as much into my conception of what a writer might be, and the kind of writer I've ended up being is very much an intersection of the two.

46:49.941 --> 46:56.670
I wish I could say that I've carved out some entirely new territory that neither of my parents had established, but I can't say that I did.

46:56.690 --> 47:02.158
I really feel that if you took what both of them did, put it in a wearing blender,

47:02.527 --> 47:31.656
but I mixed it together that probably what would come out is the kind of work that I've ended up doing sure and I think that the work that she did was every bit as important perhaps more important for my first book I remember the you know that's funny I didn't connect that collaboration with Teddy White as being

47:32.311 --> 47:33.312
you know, with your mother.

47:33.553 --> 47:34.574
It's years ago.

47:34.674 --> 47:37.999
But I do remember the Harrison Salisbury poem.

47:39.981 --> 47:43.326
Now, there was another place where I really wanted to give her proper due.

47:44.587 --> 47:46.230
Oh, I still get angry at writing about it.

47:46.250 --> 47:50.736
I recall vaguely reading that and thinking, Jesus, this guy is really, what happened to the woman?

47:50.756 --> 47:52.078
What happened to the woman?

47:52.098 --> 47:53.159
Yes, what happened to the woman?

47:53.620 --> 47:54.581
Well, it's just one of those.

47:54.601 --> 47:56.203
Well, what was she, just the gopher?

47:56.243 --> 47:59.287
I mean, did she just get the, and that's what I'm thinking, you know.

47:59.307 --> 48:01.390
And I remember I interviewed Salisbury as well, and

48:01.724 --> 48:06.510
He wrote that letter that you wrote, just like two letters that I read.

48:07.091 --> 48:08.593
At least he totally acknowledged it.

48:08.613 --> 48:09.354
He totally acknowledged it.

48:09.374 --> 48:10.095
It was a very nice letter.

48:10.115 --> 48:14.841
I remember he wrote me back very quickly and didn't make any excuses.

48:15.121 --> 48:17.103
I thought about it and said, my God, she's right.

48:17.123 --> 48:17.664
She's right.

48:18.205 --> 48:18.806
She's right.

48:19.346 --> 48:26.075
But I think that my mother's omission from that introduction probably pained me more than a painter.

48:26.155 --> 48:27.917
I think she was used to that sort of thing.

48:28.218 --> 48:34.229
But I think growing up in a different generation, I was not used to it, and I found it extraordinarily annoying.

48:35.070 --> 48:43.686
What do you make of the—and I think this might even allow us to get into a little bit of American scholars— what do you make of the modern library reading list?

48:44.427 --> 48:46.170
And the Radcliffe list, if you want to?

48:46.651 --> 48:48.635
Well, let me talk about the modern library list.

48:49.216 --> 48:52.622
Of course, because it's just 20th century,

48:53.024 --> 48:55.768
I'm less interested in it than if it were 19th century.

48:55.788 --> 49:02.119
If somebody wrote in to the New York Times saying, gee, if it included the 19th century books, it'd beat all the 20th century books.

49:02.139 --> 49:04.162
And I guess the 19th century is my century.

49:04.222 --> 49:11.955
So I would feel even more interested in the list and be more interested in arguing with it than if it were 20th century.

49:12.535 --> 49:19.707
I disagree with a lot of the books in the list, but I'm amused by it and glad that it was done.

49:19.990 --> 49:27.620
not because I think it's possible to make this sort of ranking, but because I think it's gotten people talking about great books in a way that they hadn't before.

49:28.081 --> 49:39.937
And also have people looking at the list and checking off how many they've read and thinking, gee, I've only read 20, maybe I should read more of these, and then I can actually talk about this at the next cocktail party.

49:40.418 --> 49:43.622
I feel that it's both an absurdity and a delight.

49:45.785 --> 49:47.888
I also think that the human...

49:48.880 --> 49:51.244
instinct for ranking will never go away.

49:51.264 --> 49:58.056
I went on a walk yesterday with my eight-year-old daughter, Susanna, whom you know about from Ex Libris.

49:58.737 --> 49:59.999
And as you know, she's a great reader.

50:00.059 --> 50:11.118
And she had just finished, she had read many of the Narnia books before this vacation, but finished reading the whole set, this vacation.

50:11.138 --> 50:14.263
And she said, Mommy,

50:14.581 --> 50:17.264
How would you rank the Narnia books from top to bottom?

50:17.284 --> 50:19.726
What's your favorite, second favorite, third favorite, fourth favorite?

50:19.746 --> 50:27.574
And we both, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was both our favorite, and we both thought highly of The Last Battle and The Magician's Nephew.

50:27.614 --> 50:33.500
But I liked The Silver Chair much better than she did, and she liked The Voyage of the Dawn Treader much better than I did.

50:33.520 --> 50:36.122
And I felt it was like a mini modern library list.

50:36.142 --> 50:41.387
At the age of eight, she was already thinking of literature as something rankable.

50:41.968 --> 50:43.069
And I think that

50:43.387 --> 50:56.664
It's absurd if you think of books, great books, as being like Olympic runners that can beat each other out by .01 of a second, but it's not absurd.

50:56.824 --> 51:02.692
If you think about it as the way that Susanna was thinking about C.S.

51:02.732 --> 51:07.538
Lewis, what she was saying was, I love these books so much

51:07.720 --> 51:12.426
that they are like my friends, and just the way every eight-year-old girl will rank her friends in order.

51:12.446 --> 51:15.209
This is my best friend, and my second best friend, and my third best friend.

51:15.950 --> 51:18.373
It was a sort of degrees of love.

51:19.074 --> 51:19.274
True.

51:19.294 --> 51:22.618
And that she was interested in my degrees of love, and that it said something.

51:22.638 --> 51:33.231
And then we talked about why did we both like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe best, and why didn't she like The Silver Chair as much, and why didn't I like The Voyage of the Dawn Treader as much.

51:33.251 --> 51:36.715
And it was a fascinating discussion because it was a sort of discussion

51:37.100 --> 51:40.244
They could only exist between two readers.

51:41.165 --> 51:51.659
And I feel that the modern library list is a grown-up version of the same, and therefore... I think your library list is more valid, because it's one person responding to a bunch of books.

51:51.939 --> 51:53.220
This is a more political thing.

51:53.241 --> 51:57.045
This is where you have a board, and they're arbitrating.

51:57.166 --> 52:03.073
I bet there are a lot of arguments, but you know, you have boards trying to decide who's going to win the National Book Award or the Pulitzer or whatever, and

52:03.458 --> 52:12.149
I'm sure that they also have similar arguments, and I don't see why a book that was written 50 years ago can't be argued about in the same way.

52:14.272 --> 52:17.196
Ridiculous as it was... It was fun.

52:17.456 --> 52:24.265
It was fun because it was fun in the same way that, as you know, I write in my books and I turn down the pages and manhandle them.

52:24.806 --> 52:28.791
I don't believe that books should be sacred, and I think that...

52:29.075 --> 52:33.381
imagining this panel arguing and saying, no, Elysses can't be first.

52:33.401 --> 52:33.942
Let's make it third.

52:33.962 --> 52:36.666
Well, I'll trade you my number 17 for your number 39.

52:36.686 --> 52:38.689
It's the link of Dobson.

52:38.749 --> 52:40.011
I can't believe that's on the list.

52:40.031 --> 52:42.955
But how about this one that you picked?

52:42.975 --> 52:44.938
Okay, we can have the leak if we also have yours.

52:45.859 --> 52:52.469
I mean, in some ways it's ridiculous, but it's also treating books like live, breathing things, which I believe they are.

52:53.190 --> 52:54.492
And one of mine...

52:54.927 --> 52:59.413
essays, as you remember, I talk about loving books platonically or carnally.

53:00.114 --> 53:04.200
Both kinds of love are okay, but for me, it's carnal love.

53:04.420 --> 53:14.033
I think there's something about not being too respectful, either to the physical book or to the metaphoric book, that is the content of the book.

53:15.054 --> 53:17.037
I guess you could

53:17.287 --> 53:26.068
say that maybe that book was being overly respectful by anointing these hundred as the greats and then everybody else was excluded from the club, but I don't think of it as being over-respectful, just the opposite.

53:26.368 --> 53:34.688
And I like the notion of people, I mean, it's like children, you know, it's like tug-of-war, pushing and pulling, no, this one, no, this one, no, I want it.

53:35.309 --> 53:35.890
That's great.

53:36.610 --> 53:38.932
And the fact is, it was a white man's list, too.

53:38.952 --> 53:40.734
It was a white man's list.

53:40.754 --> 53:43.577
There was only one woman on the panel, and yes, all that stuff.

53:43.597 --> 53:45.539
And an old white man's list.

53:45.559 --> 53:46.600
An older, shall we say.

53:47.020 --> 53:47.861
Yes.

53:48.401 --> 53:49.582
Old, I think.

53:50.503 --> 53:55.768
Which is all right, but it doesn't mean that these really are... It's reflective of the people who... Sure.

53:55.928 --> 54:04.236
I think it's crazy to say that these actually are the hundred best books, but as a bonus contention or something that sparks even the kind of discussion that we're having now...

54:04.486 --> 54:05.828
I think that it's great.

54:06.629 --> 54:10.635
How do you feel about the whole canon?

54:11.116 --> 54:17.486
To me, I think people are getting a little bit bored by the whole canon, literary canon debates.

54:18.067 --> 54:19.028
Do you find that?

54:20.170 --> 54:24.216
Well, maybe they're bored by it, but I think that it continues to be important.

54:24.382 --> 54:28.190
And I think that a lot of things that have become boring still are important.

54:28.310 --> 54:30.594
And I have some pretty strong feelings about the canon.

54:30.695 --> 54:31.777
Now, you went to Harvard.

54:31.857 --> 54:32.979
What was your major?

54:33.340 --> 54:34.242
History and literature.

54:34.522 --> 54:36.867
So you undoubtedly took a course in Shakespeare.

54:37.288 --> 54:37.789
Oh, sure.

54:37.809 --> 54:39.232
I did.

54:39.272 --> 54:40.855
Actually, I did Shakespeare in a...

54:41.122 --> 54:45.267
one-on-one tutorial for a whole year with Paul Cantor.

54:45.347 --> 54:48.650
In your major at Harvard, you have what's called tutorials.

54:48.690 --> 54:53.296
For sophomore year, you do a group tutorial, and then junior and senior year, it's individual tutorials.

54:53.316 --> 54:56.239
It's a wonderful opportunity to work with a professor one-on-one.

54:56.800 --> 55:01.425
So I did Shakespeare for a whole year with Paul Cantor, who is now a professor at UVA.

55:03.167 --> 55:04.328
Well, I certainly...

55:04.561 --> 55:13.714
feel that the removal of Georgetown by Georgetown and other universities of Shakespeare from their list of requirements for English majors is crazy.

55:14.234 --> 55:21.624
Yes, the notion that you could graduate with a degree in English without having read Shakespeare, Chaucer, or Milton seems to me absolutely nuts.

55:21.644 --> 55:32.239
The other reason that I believe in a canon and to some extent in a traditional canon is that I think it gives us a common frame of reference that people growing up

55:32.540 --> 56:01.433
uh fifty years ago certainly a hundred years ago would be able to recognize certain quotations from shakespeare and the bible references to greek mythology certain touchstones of english and american poetry you could throw those quotations in in a sentence without having to attribute them um it gave people a sense of having a common ground we don't have that if we don't have an accepted canon on the other hand i think that freezing a canon is

56:01.683 --> 56:13.155
just as bad as throwing out all the old chestnuts because the canon was assembled by white males and therefore consists mostly of white males.

56:13.735 --> 56:23.525
And I think that anyone who's read my first book knows that I am, and certainly I would not call myself a multiculturalist, but I'm extremely interested in other cultures.

56:23.605 --> 56:26.788
There's an important distinction in vocabulary between those two.

56:27.649 --> 56:28.450
And I...

56:28.666 --> 56:30.728
I am very interested in other cultures.

56:30.828 --> 56:32.229
I'm interested in other points of view.

56:32.330 --> 56:33.751
I'm interested in other literatures.

56:34.552 --> 56:48.125
And I think that the ideal set of requirements for a literature major in college would include much of the old canon and then a fair amount of required dipping into the literature of other cultures.

56:48.785 --> 56:57.694
I think to graduate from college as a literature major, having read only Shakespeare and Chaucer and Milton and Dickens, would be just as bad as not reading them at all.

56:58.079 --> 57:03.687
So I think that cannons need fresh air or they will suffocate.

57:04.408 --> 57:12.941
But I also think that if you throw a cannon out the window, not only do you lose the greatest literature that we have, but you lose that sense of commonality.

57:13.001 --> 57:15.484
I went down and spent a couple of days at St.

57:15.504 --> 57:16.365
John's College.

57:16.746 --> 57:18.228
Oh, I know all about it.

57:18.248 --> 57:19.470
Oh, yeah.

57:19.490 --> 57:24.778
My father was really good friends with Springfellow Barr and a lot of the other people.

57:24.798 --> 57:25.879
Oh, yes.

57:26.460 --> 57:26.620
St.

57:26.640 --> 57:27.782
John's is great.

57:28.285 --> 57:30.867
My sister-in-law's father is a professor at St.

57:30.907 --> 57:31.368
John's.

57:31.428 --> 57:41.817
But basically, if you move to admit a new book, then you have to tell me which one comes out, which is, I think that's kind of what you're saying here to a degree.

57:41.878 --> 57:43.539
Well, I would just maybe can a little bigger.

57:43.559 --> 57:51.847
I mean, I think that, yes, there's some things that probably could come out, but I'm more interested in having simply people read more.

57:51.907 --> 57:55.390
I would probably throw out

57:55.927 --> 57:59.492
25% of the books in the canon and add another 50%.

57:59.573 --> 58:04.260
I did it with Margaret Drabble, and she, of course, is the editor of the Oxford Companion.

58:04.300 --> 58:08.726
So she does decide, determine in a way, what the canon is.

58:09.367 --> 58:13.213
And so I said, well, tell me who's in and who's coming in and who's going on.

58:13.233 --> 58:18.121
And she said, well, regardless of whether anybody reads The Fairy Queen, it stays in.

58:18.361 --> 58:23.689
And there are some things that we know people don't read, but they stay in the canon.

58:23.939 --> 58:27.743
And she was talking about, you know, it's the same thing that you're saying.

58:27.763 --> 58:28.364
All right, fine.

58:28.964 --> 58:33.049
I'm going to bring in more women, more 20th century writers.

58:33.369 --> 58:38.855
But I really do, on the other hand, have to reduce on other ends.

58:40.417 --> 58:42.539
I read The Fairy Queen as a sophomore at Harvard.

58:42.559 --> 58:43.480
It was a requirement.

58:43.500 --> 58:46.744
I read it in a tutorial with very good professors.

58:47.625 --> 58:50.428
And I can't say that I learned much from it.

58:50.828 --> 58:52.630
However, every play...

58:52.981 --> 58:54.523
by Shakespeare that I read the next year.

58:54.543 --> 58:57.826
And we read all of Shakespeare, all of Johnson, and all of Marlowe.

58:58.867 --> 59:03.893
And every play of Shakespeare entered my life in an important way.

59:03.973 --> 59:04.914
Most I'd already read.

59:04.954 --> 59:16.447
And it was very useful to read them first in high school, and then again in college, and then see them again in productions as an adult, and read them now again for pleasure.

59:16.507 --> 59:21.452
I think Shakespeare you have to come to many times over the course of a lifetime.

59:21.770 --> 59:25.674
There's not one play that didn't have an effect.

59:26.054 --> 59:28.016
Titus Andronicus included?

59:28.036 --> 59:36.164
Well, I think it's not so much that Titus Andronicus is a great play, but it had an effect because it made you appreciate Shakespeare's other plays.

59:36.564 --> 59:39.307
Each one, I think, needs to be read in relation to the others.

59:39.327 --> 59:44.933
And, of course, what you don't get when you read a play in high school is the sense of how it connects to all of the other plays.

59:49.537 --> 59:51.439
I should say just about reading.

59:52.145 --> 01:00:02.079
When you were talking about my family, something entered my head, and it was that the... I'm checking off this question here, being a fad of it, so go ahead.

01:00:02.159 --> 01:00:20.785
Okay, one of the things that just entered my head before you were talking about my parents is that, as you know from ex-libris, of course, I grew up in a house that was full of books, and yet I was not an early reader...

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:33.477
because my parents wouldn't let me see the words when they read aloud to me because they didn't want my brother and me to learn how to read before all of our friends.

01:00:33.557 --> 01:00:47.953
They felt that when we reached first grade, they were worried that we were going to be labeled as brains, eggheads, and that socially things would be difficult for us and that also we'd be bored and therefore wouldn't like school.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.604
if we already knew everything that was taught in the first grade.

01:00:50.644 --> 01:00:59.661
So I remember my mother holding Dr. Sue so that we couldn't see the words, because she knew that if we could see them, we'd learn to read.

01:01:00.903 --> 01:01:05.412
But you did learn to read, I think, despite this, didn't you?

01:01:05.632 --> 01:01:06.774
Oh, no, in the first grade.

01:01:06.915 --> 01:01:08.237
I didn't learn it until I was six.

01:01:08.572 --> 01:01:10.694
I was taught how to read in school.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:15.139
I was prevented from learning how to read in this incredibly literary household.

01:01:15.159 --> 01:01:16.461
I was prevented from learning how to read.

01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:18.143
Do you think that was a good strategy?

01:01:18.423 --> 01:01:20.225
It's not one that we repeated with our children.

01:01:20.865 --> 01:01:24.650
Susannah taught herself how to read when she was five.

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:25.971
She was in kindergarten.

01:01:25.991 --> 01:01:26.892
She taught herself how to read.

01:01:28.634 --> 01:01:30.696
We didn't teach her, but she taught herself.

01:01:30.716 --> 01:01:35.001
We certainly didn't conceal the words from her.

01:01:35.504 --> 01:01:40.932
There were a couple other kids in her class who already knew how to read when they got to the first grade, and it was fine.

01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:49.804
But reading very definitely, even though the words physically were kept from you, reading was so apparent from the beginning.

01:01:49.824 --> 01:01:52.047
Oh, yes, I was read aloud to for thousands of hours.

01:01:52.067 --> 01:01:53.269
This is a way of life.

01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:58.316
Oh, yes, thousands and thousands of hours, and it's how we raised Susanna and Henry, too.

01:01:58.336 --> 01:02:02.001
Books are just completely a part of our lives.

01:02:02.437 --> 01:02:05.420
and all the books up here that Susanna is now reading.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.044
She's poking around and finding the same old children's books that George read when he was running here.

01:02:10.064 --> 01:02:13.347
When you come on a holiday like this, do you bring a lot of books?

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:19.353
No, I don't bring any books because I don't have any free time.

01:02:19.413 --> 01:02:28.782
That is, all my time on holiday is spent either with my children or in the evening after they're asleep with my husband or sleeping.

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:39.514
I did get some of your book read because when your book came out, we had only one child.
