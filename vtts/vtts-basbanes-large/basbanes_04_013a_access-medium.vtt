WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:08.047
And now we're talking to Dr. Kevin Starr, and it's November 18, 99.

00:08.267 --> 00:13.052
The 14th state librarian of California since 1850.

00:13.632 --> 00:13.933
Really?

00:14.813 --> 00:17.016
Now, does every state have a state librarian?

00:17.656 --> 00:26.285
Every state has a state librarian, but few states have a state library of the size and scope of the California State Library.

00:26.305 --> 00:31.590
The California State Library is now budgeted at $113 million a year in all its programs.

00:31.570 --> 00:38.717
More than $70 million of that is money the library administers for public libraries and other library programs in the field.

00:39.618 --> 00:50.529
If we pass the bond issue that's now before the voters in March, that will authorize the expenditure of $350 million for library construction throughout the state.

00:50.549 --> 01:00.919
It will be the single largest, as far as I can tell, bond issue, the single largest amount of money ever authorized at one time for the construction of libraries in the history of this republic.

01:01.388 --> 01:02.870
Mr. The Nation.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.113
Are these all public libraries?

01:05.133 --> 01:07.517
These will be public libraries and school libraries.

01:08.057 --> 01:08.177
Okay.

01:08.198 --> 01:11.682
So that really is your purview, public libraries and school libraries.

01:11.702 --> 01:14.106
Well, no, because we also have the Library of California.

01:14.687 --> 01:18.872
The Library of California is operated by the State Library.

01:19.393 --> 01:27.885
It's authorized by a special bill signed by the governor, which authorizes the 8,000 public and private libraries in the state.

01:28.372 --> 01:41.908
under the guidance of the state library to form a resource sharing network that cuts across multi-types, that cuts across public libraries, private libraries, government libraries, special libraries, law libraries, corporate libraries.

01:42.513 --> 01:44.215
It will be astonishing.

01:44.275 --> 01:48.059
It'll take about 10 to 15 years or 10 years to pull this program together.

01:48.079 --> 01:49.721
So this is just an assumption right now?

01:49.761 --> 01:50.362
We just started.

01:50.682 --> 01:51.983
There's a second year of it now.

01:52.164 --> 01:55.627
Are you going to have a facility or is it more of a conceptual thing?

01:55.868 --> 01:59.031
Conceptually, in today's world, you don't need a facility.

01:59.051 --> 02:00.212
You just need super servers.

02:00.873 --> 02:09.162
We have eight planning districts throughout the state, which will eventually become eight regions for this Library of California.

02:09.142 --> 02:10.365
But they're cooperative.

02:10.405 --> 02:12.631
This is not a new governmental entity.

02:12.771 --> 02:13.974
It's a government program.

02:13.994 --> 02:19.589
It's a program which the state of California, the state library will be conducting.

02:19.669 --> 02:22.536
So is it more of a clearinghouse kind of a function?

02:22.997 --> 02:24.822
It's a resource sharing network.

02:25.460 --> 02:33.876
The day will come when one person, by entering any one of the 8,000 libraries in the state, is basically entering every library.

02:35.299 --> 02:41.190
And there'll be union catalogs, there'll be, of course, the sharing of digital information,

02:41.170 --> 03:03.246
And even, even, and that's the longer, more expensive aspect of it, the sharing of hard copy, which is to say you can walk into a library in Sacramento and search out a title of the search engine will determine that that book is only available in the University of California at San Diego, and that book will get to you.

03:04.648 --> 03:04.748
Yeah.

03:05.200 --> 03:11.002
So somebody with a public library card can borrow a book from Berkeley?

03:11.163 --> 03:16.543
This is the pioneering dimension of it and which takes the most

03:17.283 --> 03:32.639
sophisticated negotiation is to make sure that the university libraries play in this field, that they're not panicked, that suddenly 85 people will want a copy of the movie Dick because a high school in Chico is assigning that.

03:33.340 --> 03:42.750
So we work out protocols, et cetera, and those protocols can be brought into the actual programs, the computer programs that will be evolving.

03:42.730 --> 03:45.053
to make sure that we don't have these abuses.

03:45.073 --> 03:54.665
Well, would you believe that Holy Cross just emailed me, and the only copy that they can find of Jesse Scherer's book on the Foundation of Public Libraries is the Harvard copy.

03:55.926 --> 03:59.030
See, that's a very typical, but that's an example of that.

03:59.050 --> 04:03.996
Now, does that mean that you have to go to... No, Holy Cross is bringing it in from... In fact, they're using...

04:03.976 --> 04:07.681
Yeah, the email says, Nick, it's here.

04:07.741 --> 04:08.583
Come get it, you know.

04:09.224 --> 04:10.626
Yeah, which is wonderful.

04:10.786 --> 04:11.407
Sure.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.750
Well, what we're doing is that.

04:13.790 --> 04:15.372
Of course, we already do that in California.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.517
We do it among public libraries and we do it among academic libraries.

04:18.557 --> 04:24.145
But the idea of creating a multi-type library of California is a little more sophisticated.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.727
Well, as I say, that's why.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.489
Give us a decade to really make it work.

04:27.629 --> 04:29.632
And this is your baby, basically.

04:30.973 --> 04:32.515
I am a state librarian.

04:32.555 --> 04:39.284
We got the legislation through, and the California Library Association played a major role in lobbying this through.

04:40.125 --> 04:46.032
But it's my baby as a state librarian to develop it over the next number of years, and I'm already busy doing that.

04:46.012 --> 04:54.982
Well, you are not only a historian, but a historian of some note, and I'm looking at a couple of your books as we speak, you know.

04:55.002 --> 04:56.884
Well, thank you for saying that.

04:56.904 --> 05:12.762
I've been embarked upon a multi-volume social and cultural history of California, and I'm now catching up on my current volume, which is the sixth in the series, will take me to 1911.

05:14.564 --> 05:21.333
Well, I found what you had written on Jake Zeitlin most useful.

05:21.573 --> 05:23.135
Oh, I love Jake.

05:23.156 --> 05:33.990
Well, Jake, in the case of Jake, that whole circle around his bookstore at the side of the grasshopper and later the big red barn there, that whole circle was in effect the Bohemia.

05:33.970 --> 05:40.345
the literary intelligentsia of Los Angeles in the 1920s and somewhat into the 1930s.

05:40.846 --> 05:48.142
By the mid to late 30s, of course, you have a tremendous writer and bohemian group centered in and around the motion picture studios.

05:48.864 --> 05:48.964
Yeah.

05:48.984 --> 05:49.947
I'm doing a chapter.

05:49.987 --> 05:53.194
I'm developing a chapter on this idea of this scholar bookseller.

05:53.174 --> 05:59.264
And, of course, Jake's in there, and Raden is in there, you know, Warren Howell, I guess.

05:59.364 --> 06:01.047
Warren Howell is a very good friend of mine.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.110
And Jake was a good friend of mine.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.773
I was perverse to know them each.

06:04.793 --> 06:13.247
Warren, based out of San Francisco, of course, there at the corner of Post and Powell.

06:14.288 --> 06:17.173
Well, I'm really very interested in all of it.

06:17.660 --> 06:21.548
All of the material that you've written on the book culture in California.

06:21.568 --> 06:24.574
But I guess the... Well, feel free to borrow freely.

06:25.355 --> 06:27.941
Well, I cite everything, so... Well, you certainly cite everything.

06:28.141 --> 06:32.109
But, you know, we all belong to a community of interpretation.

06:32.229 --> 06:32.710
That's right.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.674
And no one person can interpret everything.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.660
And I try to cite meticulously myself, but I'm very proud.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.181
People use my materials.

06:39.201 --> 06:41.844
Well, that's why we do it.

06:42.705 --> 06:49.851
Actually, Jake has a darn good oral history at UCLA, which I have, and Larry Powell's got a great oral history.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.212
I have copies of both of them.

06:51.232 --> 06:52.473
I have them both here, too.

06:52.494 --> 06:54.255
I didn't really get to use them in the first book.

06:54.295 --> 06:57.418
I'm hoping to use them.

06:57.638 --> 06:58.419
I am a scholar.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.321
I'm also a university professor.

07:00.421 --> 07:03.023
I hold the rank of university professor at USC.

07:03.844 --> 07:06.246
I'm one of eight people on the faculty of 2000 to hold

07:06.226 --> 07:12.709
And I'm also a contributing editor, as you just found out, to the Los Angeles Times.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.905
Although as a state official, I take no money from the newspapers.

07:16.925 --> 07:18.127
It's prohibited by law.

07:18.147 --> 07:25.520
Well, I have to say I have my own personal LexisNexis account, which is not inexpensive, but it's really been essential for this book.

07:26.322 --> 07:30.629
And just doing a search of Kevin Starr, I know who you write for.

07:30.649 --> 07:33.494
I mean, you have voluminous entries out there.

07:34.055 --> 07:36.720
You're really very well represented in the L.A.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.443
Times and any number of other...

07:38.423 --> 07:43.471
But all these things feed into my professional mind.

07:43.511 --> 07:45.494
And this is what I'm driving at here, right, exactly.

07:45.915 --> 08:04.684
And I think that, just as we were saying earlier, I think the idea that librarians must remain productive intellectuals in part of our cadre, or we're going to lose the profession, just as we must remain skilled technologists.

08:05.255 --> 08:08.419
in part of our cadre or we'll lose the profession.

08:08.439 --> 08:13.004
And we must remain skilled public administrators or we'll lose the profession.

08:13.465 --> 08:21.555
We'll lose the profession in one case to scholars, in the other case we'll lose it to technologists, in the other case we'll lose it to skilled public administrators who are not librarians.

08:22.155 --> 08:26.841
Because librarianship as a subject, of course, the core of it is bibliography.

08:27.209 --> 08:34.637
including digital bibliography and search, the navigation of knowledge, classification and navigation of knowledge.

08:35.017 --> 08:47.150
But surrounding librarianship are multiple skills, in administration, in public relations, and must, to repeat myself, it must be connected also with the life of the mind.

08:47.330 --> 08:47.851
I think so.

08:48.211 --> 08:52.035
It cannot just be, you know, the old lyric of...

08:52.218 --> 09:18.478
of uh of books unlearned men assume the care as eunuchs are made guardians of the fair must not be applicable to us so i um i'm very proud to be a librarian i always name it as my first as my profession really and this this isn't exactly a profession that you chose i mean this was not where this was not your career track i mean you were it was my career track you know we all

09:19.117 --> 09:21.823
What the Beatles say, you can't always get what you want.

09:22.244 --> 09:23.928
Not the Beatles, the Rolling Stones.

09:23.968 --> 09:24.891
Rolling Stones, right.

09:24.911 --> 09:28.760
Yeah, you can't always get what you want, but if you try real hard, you get what you need.

09:29.281 --> 09:35.235
When I was doing my doctorate at Harvard, I was very good friends with Gordon Buchanan and Ted Alavisos.

09:35.553 --> 09:37.417
of the Harvard Library.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.823
Gordon was director.

09:40.184 --> 09:43.411
They each were sort of up at the deputy university librarian level.

09:44.534 --> 09:53.595
And I socialized and partied with the librarians and was thinking of getting a library degree on the side at Simmons.

09:54.149 --> 09:55.931
Which is a pretty good program, actually.

09:55.951 --> 09:57.272
Yes, it is.

09:57.292 --> 10:03.859
But then I went out on leave in San Francisco, and the mayor made me librarian of the city.

10:04.300 --> 10:04.941
That's amazing.

10:04.961 --> 10:06.422
I read about that in Wiley's book.

10:06.442 --> 10:07.704
I didn't realize that.

10:08.084 --> 10:11.287
Wiley was sort of ambivalent to me in that book.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.410
Kind of ambivalent to me.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.372
I don't know why, but anyway.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.054
I can guess.

10:17.114 --> 10:21.118
And I would like to talk about San Francisco at some point, too, because I have to say I did...

10:21.622 --> 10:26.368
I spent about ten days out there, two years ago, really, trying to nail down that whole story.

10:26.928 --> 10:28.890
Well, I'd be happy to do that.

10:29.191 --> 10:34.917
And, of course, I do have the POE, which is, and you must have some thoughts on the POE, which came out in July, too.

10:34.938 --> 10:35.678
Oh, good for you.

10:35.698 --> 10:36.760
God, what a research you are.

10:37.340 --> 10:37.861
Absolutely.

10:38.101 --> 10:39.042
We'll go into that.

10:39.062 --> 10:39.703
It's a separate topic.

10:39.763 --> 10:43.107
Okay, but I really, I have to say, you know, when we talk about...

10:43.087 --> 10:53.086
I've got the great letter by Jurist Frankfurter to FDR, you know, supporting the nomination of Archibald McQueach.

10:53.708 --> 11:00.100
And, you know, he said librarianship, he said not to put it down, but this is something you can learn kind of on the job.

11:00.140 --> 11:04.268
What we need is a person who loves books, knows, loves books, knows books.

11:04.248 --> 11:11.255
And as a humanist, I'm paraphrasing him very badly here, but... Well, that's a challenge to our profession, so I agree with the justice.

11:12.357 --> 11:18.844
Now, when I was made acting librarian at the city, I went and got a library degree at Berkeley, and I loved it.

11:18.944 --> 11:25.270
I got my Master of Library Science degree while being acting, and as soon as I finished the degree, they made my acting to city librarian.

11:25.491 --> 11:28.894
Yeah, well, they made it almost conditional, didn't they, for you to get the job?

11:29.895 --> 11:32.398
The mayor didn't make it conditional, but it...

11:32.935 --> 11:35.179
I made it conditional and the commission wanted it.

11:35.620 --> 11:40.589
Well, it sort of more or less resolved the problems with the union, I guess, so to speak.

11:40.649 --> 11:41.049
Right, right.

11:41.110 --> 11:41.891
And I don't blame them.

11:42.412 --> 11:47.561
I don't blame them at all for having somebody being made a librarian of a great city without a degree.

11:47.982 --> 11:53.712
The fact that I was a productive scholar, the fact that I love books...

11:54.856 --> 11:59.264
It still did not compensate for the fact I didn't have my union card, which I was proud to get.

11:59.364 --> 12:02.069
Let me tell you, I loved the library school at Berkeley.

12:02.109 --> 12:07.358
And if you want to talk about the way that that school has been hijacked from librarianship, we can get back to that.

12:07.378 --> 12:07.959
Yeah, well, we do.

12:08.280 --> 12:15.733
I would because I want to ask your thoughts not only about that, but Columbia scuttling their program, Chicago scuttling their program.

12:15.833 --> 12:16.695
That's great.

12:16.675 --> 12:21.723
Well, but anyway, so then I served as librarian of San Francisco.

12:21.784 --> 12:22.685
Two years, right?

12:22.705 --> 12:24.368
74 to 76, I think.

12:24.388 --> 12:25.370
No, no, no, no.

12:25.390 --> 12:28.395
73, all through 73, 74, 75, into 76.

12:28.795 --> 12:33.163
Yeah, so Wiley's got the dates wrong, I think.

12:33.403 --> 12:34.545
Well, whatever.

12:35.266 --> 12:36.388
Maybe I got them wrong now.

12:36.468 --> 12:36.889
Well, that's all.

12:36.909 --> 12:37.650
I'll check them.

12:37.911 --> 12:38.211
All right.

12:38.950 --> 12:44.217
He didn't give me credit for the acting time, I think, whereas I always considered it a continuity.

12:44.797 --> 12:53.188
And, of course, at that time, I advanced plans for the restoration of the existing building.

12:53.208 --> 13:08.687
I advanced plans that would take about 37% of our space on the Hyde Street side that was literally dirt earth and develop that with closed shelving, finish off the wing on the, not the Larkin, but the

13:09.005 --> 13:25.889
Yeah, the far, what is it, Hyde Street side, right, the Hyde Street side, on the back, finish off that wing, which there was no wing, sink a great kind of geodesic dome in the center because we no longer needed the light well because of late or early 20th century lighting requirements.

13:26.550 --> 13:31.497
And I thought that for about $18 to $20 million, I could recycle that building for a couple hundred years.

13:32.038 --> 13:36.504
I brought that idea to the library board, and they said it was unworthy.

13:37.105 --> 13:38.387
They wanted this new building.

13:38.975 --> 13:40.819
How do you feel in retrospect?

13:40.839 --> 13:41.400
I was right.

13:42.342 --> 13:49.737
On the other hand, I was right, although I'm thrilled that the building will be recycled as the Asian Art Museum.

13:50.378 --> 13:52.623
I'm thrilled that the building is still going to stay alive.

13:53.204 --> 13:59.397
I was right because basically the building they built is almost, is not almost, but it's a reverse paradigm.

13:59.984 --> 14:08.358
of what a great public library should be because it's a building that got mongered by notions.

14:08.699 --> 14:10.542
You know the phrase notion mongering?

14:11.123 --> 14:16.772
It got mongered by the architectural notions of that great light well that sweeps up the center of it.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.837
It makes it so impossible to store books, etc.

14:20.378 --> 14:25.587
It got mongered by the notion that the public library should be a sort of mall for computers.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.742
Well, you're anticipating all my questions.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.646
I didn't have to ask you questions here.

14:30.706 --> 14:34.213
All for computers rather than a great public library.

14:34.734 --> 14:45.195
It also lost sight of the fact that the San Francisco Public Library, despite its difficulties and underfunding, was a distinguished collection.

14:45.631 --> 14:46.152
It was?

14:46.212 --> 14:48.136
You put that in the past tense.

14:48.156 --> 14:54.429
Well, because the very act of going into that new building meant that they had to deaccession about a half a million books.

14:54.449 --> 14:58.777
And as we know in librarianship, you never move and deaccession at the same time.

14:59.559 --> 15:02.424
Because that winds up into just bulk dumping.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.811
Shouldn't Mr. Dallin have appreciated that, do you think?

15:05.831 --> 15:06.412
He should have.

15:06.493 --> 15:07.234
Shouldn't he have?

15:07.214 --> 15:10.597
Every title on your shelf has a constituency.

15:11.138 --> 15:15.862
There's only one way to deaccession a book, and that's title by title by title.

15:16.063 --> 15:17.644
Now, let me just interrupt for a second.

15:17.664 --> 15:33.620
When I interviewed Ken Dowell and I interviewed everybody out there, and what I find, you know, particularly, I'm going to try and find the right adjective, but what upsets me most of all is that they didn't even keep a record of the books that they got rid of.

15:33.760 --> 15:33.880
No.

15:33.860 --> 15:39.351
I mean, it's like sending people off to a concentration camp and not even writing down their names, at least.

15:39.451 --> 15:40.353
Your first name is Nicholas.

15:40.413 --> 15:40.674
Nick.

15:40.694 --> 15:41.275
Nick is fine.

15:41.295 --> 15:41.816
Yeah, Nicholas.

15:42.077 --> 15:43.179
I wish you would.

15:43.199 --> 15:43.439
Yeah.

15:43.459 --> 15:53.640
The reason, Nick, they didn't do this is because they were not going through the process of professional deaccession, where you take each book and you look up its records.

15:54.076 --> 15:58.430
And you examine and say, what is the constituency of this book in terms of its circulation?

15:59.192 --> 16:06.516
But more importantly, what is the constituency of this book in the architecture of academic knowledge?

16:07.171 --> 16:21.648
And if I have a book on deacons in the early church, and that book hasn't circulated for 15 years, I keep it on the shelves because some college student writing a course, writing a paper on early church history, might need it six years from now.

16:21.688 --> 16:23.751
This is a theme, by the way, that I have.

16:23.771 --> 16:34.984
I open my new book with, I know I don't want to waste all the time, but I open in the Boston Athenaeum when I was tying up Gentle Madness.

16:35.369 --> 16:44.050
And I was desperate to find the catalog to an edition of the Peeps catalog from 19, whatever it was.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.436
I find it at the Athenaeum.

16:46.476 --> 16:49.744
I hadn't been able to find it at Harvard or any place else.

16:50.266 --> 16:51.589
And I'm checking it out.

16:51.569 --> 16:54.874
And I'm the first person to take it out in 81 years.

16:55.455 --> 16:56.296
Well, that's okay.

16:56.477 --> 16:59.922
Well, anyway, I say this is a true story, and I use it, and this is how I conclude.

16:59.942 --> 17:01.925
Right, well, I gave you an example of 13 years.

17:01.965 --> 17:18.471
Right, and so I say... Well, when they went and said, we will build a building in which we become enamored of a mall, in which the architect, who's enamored of architecture, takes away a significant percentage of our space with a light well going nowhere and doing nothing,

17:18.451 --> 17:22.297
except showing forth the glories of his architecture.

17:23.419 --> 17:31.473
And then we must move into a new building, and somehow in the process of that, and moving a library, incidentally, is one of the great heroic efforts.

17:31.553 --> 17:42.231
We at the State Library, two years ago, moved 27 miles of books as we refit our old building with a $22 million seismic retrofit.

17:42.211 --> 17:50.214
But when you do that and say at the same time, we're going to get rid of a half a million books, you have a formula for catastrophe.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.285
And they try to do it so nobody would know about it, which is even worse.

17:54.305 --> 17:54.887
Of course.

17:55.357 --> 18:17.396
Of course, because do you think the taxpayer, the buying public, do you think anybody would cooperate with the dismantlement of a collection which has been developed in one way or another since 1906 and even before 1906 because retroactive buying, et cetera, of titles, et cetera, a distinguished collection?

18:17.457 --> 18:24.823
For instance, I researched good parts of my Americans in the California Dream series at the San Francisco Public.

18:25.529 --> 18:34.290
and found superb collections in, say, show business, the history of Hollywood, spectacular collections in the California novel fiction.

18:34.651 --> 18:43.251
Now, some of these novels no one's read for 50 years, but if they're important novels, they should, in terms of chronicling the social life of California, they should be kept on the shelves.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.586
It was just astonishing.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.393
Astonishing what was it.

18:48.413 --> 18:52.142
But let me tell you now what both Ken Dallin and Gina Minudri told me.

18:52.503 --> 18:59.661
And I asked them, do you feel that the San Francisco Public Library serves a function as a research level library?

18:59.701 --> 19:00.784
And they both said no.

19:01.523 --> 19:02.705
They both said no.

19:02.885 --> 19:08.874
And, you know, I asked Bernie Margolis, you know, I said, what do you think of that?

19:09.435 --> 19:12.660
You know, of course, BPL is an ARL library.

19:12.740 --> 19:14.783
So, I mean, we know how they stand.

19:15.024 --> 19:22.174
Well, that means that they took San Francisco then out of the league of the Los Angeles Public Library, which is a great research library.

19:23.316 --> 19:29.826
San Francisco out of the league of the Boston Public Library and certainly out of the league of the New York Public Library and the Free Library of Philadelphia.

19:30.413 --> 19:35.108
And they disestablished a library that was a distinguished collection.

19:35.229 --> 19:40.747
And they both said, in different words, well, we've got Berkeley here, we've got Stanford here.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.917
If a person wants to do research at that level,

19:44.572 --> 19:46.356
You know, we have these other resources here.

19:46.396 --> 19:47.839
Well, is there a mandate?

19:47.859 --> 19:50.105
Did they have a mandate for the voters to do that?

19:50.205 --> 19:50.987
I don't believe so.

19:51.287 --> 19:54.274
But then at the same time, they also dismantled these departments.

19:54.835 --> 20:02.192
You know, I mean, the departments for books, for literature, for the humanities, they made one big department.

20:02.780 --> 20:11.075
You know, I mean, I talked to... You know, I'm probably being indiscreet talking to you because as a state official, I should be above the fray.

20:11.275 --> 20:20.130
Well, I have to say also that... But I also am a librarian, and the things that we're talking about, we're not in the business of disestablishment.

20:20.571 --> 20:23.757
They disestablished a distinguished collection, didn't they?

20:23.917 --> 20:24.518
They did.

20:25.814 --> 20:28.478
And you kept your counsel, I have to say.

20:28.618 --> 20:36.149
I saw people tape you on TV, and I saw you when the library was opening.

20:36.350 --> 20:39.054
I mean, you really didn't store the pot or anything like that.

20:39.114 --> 20:44.361
Well, because we have a tradition in California that state officials, besides, Nick, it was done.

20:44.382 --> 20:46.084
It has been done.

20:46.064 --> 20:59.167
It's only this recent report, for instance, that's come out that's actually corroborated fully with people like Gray Brecken and Nick Baker, etc., have been pointing out for some time.

21:00.530 --> 21:10.688
To say that, for instance, to say that the library, the largest public library at the center, at ground zero,

21:11.309 --> 21:26.405
of the fourth largest urban population mass in the nation, possessed of a collection that is basically moving towards 100 years old, should disestablish that collection without any mandate, public discussion, etc.

21:26.445 --> 21:28.167
It's rather shocking, isn't it?

21:28.787 --> 21:34.914
You said earlier about a half a million books, so actually it was worse than they even acknowledged, wasn't it?

21:35.054 --> 21:36.836
What do they say?

21:36.876 --> 21:41.080
Baker and others alleged as many as 200,000.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.563
Okay.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.407
Well, I mean, I don't know.

21:44.427 --> 21:49.456
The reason I'm saying that is that they have another couple hundred thousand sitting in storage down in Brooksville.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.440
Actually, they have like a million down in Brooksville.

21:51.460 --> 21:51.621
Okay.

21:51.641 --> 21:53.304
That they're trying to give away, okay?

21:53.585 --> 21:54.146
Exactly.

21:54.186 --> 21:55.468
You use the numbers that you think.

21:55.508 --> 21:57.432
What numbers do you think that they have?

21:57.412 --> 22:00.115
And you talk about the day that library opened.

22:00.135 --> 22:01.898
It was supposed to be good at least until 2020.

22:01.978 --> 22:03.239
The shelves were full.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.742
I mean, what kind of planning is that?

22:05.863 --> 22:09.828
There's a million books in storage, and I know they're actively trying to give away about 100,000.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.672
I think your numbers are fine, actually.

22:14.954 --> 22:17.137
We won't know any records, do we?

22:17.217 --> 22:18.198
We don't have any records.

22:18.258 --> 22:20.601
And I've been down to Brooks Hall, and that's another thing.

22:20.581 --> 22:27.571
You know, you say it is wonderful that the Old Main is going to be the Asian Arts Center, but wouldn't it have been nice if they had kept that?

22:27.691 --> 22:32.638
Like, you know, the BPL builds the Johnson Building, but we certainly keep the McKim Building next door.

22:32.979 --> 22:34.641
But you see, that's what my plan would have done.

22:35.582 --> 22:36.684
Now, you've seen that building.

22:36.704 --> 22:37.745
You know the side there.

22:37.846 --> 22:38.206
That's right.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.908
The side that faces the new library.

22:39.948 --> 22:41.751
Underneath that was all just earth.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.835
It was uncomplete, that bottom side.

22:45.296 --> 22:50.183
I would have dug out a couple floors there and put closed compact shelving.

22:51.158 --> 22:54.087
And I would have handled any number of volumes for years to come.

22:54.508 --> 22:59.303
I would have taken and built another wing in the back, which was incomplete because they ran out of money in 1917.

23:00.767 --> 23:03.295
And then I would have sunk this great dome in the center.

23:04.321 --> 23:10.849
And in sinking the dome in the center, I could have had a kind of festival quality, which is a good thing to have in a library.

23:10.889 --> 23:18.377
You know, I don't mean to get you into a, to try and draw you into an exchange between Dowell and any of these others.

23:18.417 --> 23:19.859
No, I'm not going to answer that.

23:20.019 --> 23:20.600
That's my opinion.

23:20.620 --> 23:21.741
Yeah, that's right.

23:21.761 --> 23:26.787
But what I am, Dowell does say that he was brought to San Francisco.

23:26.827 --> 23:29.470
I mean, he says a point blank to build that library.

23:29.570 --> 23:32.033
He believes that's why Mayor Feinstein...

23:32.013 --> 23:38.496
recommended that he be hired, and he said, there's no doubt in my mind that I was brought here to build this library.

23:38.662 --> 23:45.448
And then, of course, he'd written that book, The Electronic Library, and I guess he'd done a similar kind of thing out in Colorado Springs.

23:45.508 --> 23:58.280
I've talked to people, by the way, that followed him out in Colorado Springs, so I do have a sense of how his vision was put in place in another assignment.

23:58.420 --> 24:08.449
But I'm just wondering, do you believe that he was, in fact, brought in to build a library, more specifically this library, this library of the future?

24:09.104 --> 24:13.292
that he went ahead and created.

24:14.167 --> 24:25.421
In other words, you're asking me as to whether or not the elite, the political elite, including Mayor Feinstein and the friends of the library, told him to establish that collection.

24:25.501 --> 24:27.183
No, no, I'm not even suggesting that.

24:27.223 --> 24:27.524
No, no.

24:28.405 --> 24:29.726
The library that he built.

24:30.427 --> 24:34.652
I mean, do you think they had in mind this 21st century electronic library?

24:34.672 --> 24:35.694
Do you think that's what it is?

24:36.234 --> 24:38.137
No, I think that's what his vision was, though.

24:38.437 --> 24:40.039
What do you think it's become?

24:40.019 --> 24:44.348
Well, I think maybe that's a question for you, not me.

24:45.009 --> 24:46.191
I'm just a journalist.

24:46.272 --> 24:47.514
I'm curious what you think.

24:47.734 --> 24:49.318
It's kind of a mall, isn't it?

24:49.338 --> 24:50.440
There's a search for a metaphor.

24:51.302 --> 24:53.005
It's sort of a mall that you walk around.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.372
You know how kids used to walk around shopping center malls or teenagers?

24:56.392 --> 25:01.943
Well, the first time I went in and I had my little tape recorder with me, I said, it is, you know, it's attractive.

25:01.923 --> 25:08.352
And I played the tape recorder because I really wanted to pick up the acoustics.

25:08.472 --> 25:11.036
I mean, this is not a place where you go to read.

25:11.156 --> 25:14.361
I mean, a string quartet would perform beautifully in there.

25:14.481 --> 25:16.363
It's a kind of entertainment center.

25:16.504 --> 25:16.804
It is.

25:16.904 --> 25:19.187
And I do believe they had that in mind.

25:19.328 --> 25:21.210
Well, then they succeeded.

25:21.451 --> 25:22.272
And they succeeded.

25:22.352 --> 25:26.698
I cannot answer the question as to whether or not the mayor or the...

25:26.678 --> 25:31.166
Friends of the Library or the Library Commission specifically instructed him to do this.

25:31.506 --> 25:32.789
I was not privy to that.

25:32.849 --> 25:37.617
Yeah, and I don't even think I wanted to, I don't even think I was asking to go that far.

25:37.717 --> 25:38.779
No, I don't know.

25:38.839 --> 25:39.961
Well, let me ask this.

25:40.021 --> 25:41.484
Were you asked for any input?

25:42.326 --> 25:44.890
None whatsoever, because I was on record.

25:45.865 --> 25:53.196
as favoring the restoration of what I've already outlined.

25:53.296 --> 26:09.882
And in fact, in coming up against such resistance was one of the factors that determined, that encouraged me to resign my job, even though Mayor Aliotto wanted me to stay on, and Mayor Moscone, who was later assassinated, had specifically

26:10.638 --> 26:35.329
asked me to stay on. What do you think to jump around a little bit what do you think of this concept of the of the affinity rooms, that's you know these these rooms that they've built over there, which are pretty, again they're handsome, they're attractive, but none of them are really building collections. Now that now San Francisco should have a great gay lesbian collection it certainly should it should have and all those of these

26:35.309 --> 26:39.707
These theme rooms, et cetera, are wonderful, provided that they're tied to collections.

26:39.727 --> 26:40.732
And I don't think they are.

26:40.752 --> 26:45.150
If they're just public meeting rooms, then they could be had in less expensive spaces.

26:45.535 --> 26:50.439
But they should be tied to the purposes of the library, to scholarship, to archival research, et cetera.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.141
And to build collections.

26:52.161 --> 26:58.046
I know that Regina Menudry does not have any of that going yet.

26:58.507 --> 27:06.874
In fact, at one point, we were negotiating about possibly getting a hold of the Veterans Building across the city hall for the Sutro Library.

27:07.555 --> 27:15.542
At that point, Regina said to me, well, gee, if I got that, could she have some room to build her gay and lesbian collection?

27:15.522 --> 27:17.607
meaning she was looking for a room already.

27:17.967 --> 27:19.210
Yeah, amazing.

27:20.553 --> 27:29.292
I'm not against those theme rooms because San Francisco is a multicultural, multi... San Francisco is a city of great tolerance and inclusiveness.

27:29.653 --> 27:32.198
But if you're going to do it in the library,

27:32.178 --> 27:33.701
you should do it in a library way.

27:33.722 --> 27:35.987
If you're going to do it in a museum, there should be paintings attached.

27:36.287 --> 27:39.354
If you're going to do it in a library, there should be books, manuscripts, archives attached.

27:39.375 --> 27:40.397
And that was my problem.

27:40.537 --> 27:47.453
I had a long interview with Coulter, and I said, you know, great, congratulations, you raised $30 million, and you, and, and,

27:47.433 --> 27:54.403
You know, I mean, Paul LeClaire told me, this was two years ago, so he said, do you realize I have to raise $500,000 a week?

27:54.663 --> 27:58.769
I mean, he said, that's what it takes me to run the New York Public Library.

27:59.490 --> 28:00.392
And they do very well.

28:01.413 --> 28:05.058
You know, if you're raising money in San Francisco, congratulations, you're doing a good job.

28:05.219 --> 28:08.243
I certainly would never be critical of that.

28:08.560 --> 28:13.166
But wouldn't it be a good idea to use some of those resources to build collections?

28:13.186 --> 28:15.569
And that's why I asked about... They can't do that now.

28:15.589 --> 28:16.731
There's no room for the collections.

28:16.751 --> 28:18.714
There's no room for the collections, number one.

28:18.734 --> 28:29.488
And I don't think that... And Coulter did say, by the way, he said, you know, when they went on their tour, he walked into the Schomburg Library in Harlem, which is one of the great libraries.

28:29.468 --> 28:30.910
And he said, this is it.

28:30.930 --> 28:36.418
What I would like to establish in San Francisco is a Gay Schomburg Library.

28:36.658 --> 28:37.720
What a great idea.

28:38.220 --> 28:39.262
But he didn't do that.

28:39.502 --> 28:40.483
He didn't.

28:40.523 --> 28:41.184
That'd be fine.

28:41.204 --> 28:44.249
And you have traditions of scholarship like Randy Schultz.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.130
Exactly.

28:45.150 --> 28:46.932
You have traditions of writers.

28:47.553 --> 28:48.595
Armistead, Mopon.

28:48.615 --> 28:49.536
You've got...

28:49.516 --> 28:52.301
that book on coming out during World War II.

28:52.741 --> 28:53.082
Right.

28:53.102 --> 28:56.728
You've got a lot of writers and collecting in this area.

28:56.988 --> 28:57.129
Right.

28:57.149 --> 29:00.013
And for instance, the Ginsburg collection, that went to Stanford.

29:00.053 --> 29:01.295
Now that cost a million dollars.

29:01.315 --> 29:02.137
That was a lot of money.

29:02.618 --> 29:06.564
But that's the kind of thing that could have been, you know, I think they could have gotten for San Francisco.

29:06.604 --> 29:13.195
Well, see, that's the things that a mall, an entertainment mall, the library as entertainment mall can't do these things you're talking about.

29:13.175 --> 29:14.297
That's part of the classic.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.799
You have to have a classic library.

29:16.119 --> 29:17.001
You have to have space.

29:17.021 --> 29:19.605
You have to have collection development space.

29:20.266 --> 29:24.252
You have to be oriented towards that kind of material the way that Stanford is under Mike Keller.

29:24.973 --> 29:29.740
Because Stanford Library is not an entertainment mall.

29:29.820 --> 29:30.562
It's a library.

29:30.842 --> 29:31.984
That's right.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.828
And I think that Ken Dallin...

29:35.416 --> 29:37.920
He basically told you his motivation.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.805
I don't want to get in a fight with him or question his motives.

29:40.826 --> 29:41.787
He told you his motivation.

29:41.867 --> 29:45.394
If you want to do that, you're supposed to go to Stanford or Cal.

29:45.514 --> 29:45.995
That's right.

29:46.015 --> 29:47.056
If you want to do that kind of work.

29:47.698 --> 29:51.164
I have him quoted on that, and you don't even have to respond to it.

29:51.184 --> 29:56.172
No, it must be the same way of saying that if you wanted to write a book in Boston, go over to Harvard.

29:56.193 --> 29:58.757
You don't go to the Boston Public Library.

29:58.737 --> 30:04.662
Or worse to worse, if you want to write a book in New York, go down to NYU.

30:05.023 --> 30:06.244
Don't go to 42nd Street.

30:06.364 --> 30:06.844
Right.

30:07.485 --> 30:09.246
Or Columbia or whatever.

30:09.286 --> 30:09.747
Exactly.

30:11.148 --> 30:12.109
We're covering all these things.

30:12.189 --> 30:13.871
By the way, let me know when you have to run.

30:13.911 --> 30:14.491
No, no.

30:14.511 --> 30:15.492
I'll stay as long as you want.

30:15.512 --> 30:22.298
Now, I'm also very, and I think to balance off, and I'm really very, I love libraries.

30:22.779 --> 30:28.744
In fact, with this book, my wife and I travel the world to go to the great libraries through history.

30:28.724 --> 30:33.651
And I certainly am using as counterbalance to this.

30:33.691 --> 30:34.452
Look at the L.A.

30:34.492 --> 30:36.095
situation, that horrible fire.

30:36.796 --> 30:39.099
They took, what, seven years to build a new library?

30:39.119 --> 30:39.940
Well, look what they built.

30:40.401 --> 30:40.801
That's right.

30:40.842 --> 30:45.628
And they've kept the academic, the research integrity of the Los Angeles Public Library there.

30:46.069 --> 30:50.435
First of all, they did a little ceremonial space with those escalators, but that's fine.

30:51.096 --> 30:55.002
Because on all the floors are great collections.

30:55.403 --> 31:02.892
which were lovingly put many of them in freeze-dried cellars and brought back through rather technology, which I don't fully understand.

31:03.433 --> 31:11.022
But it's a proud member of the urban research libraries group, etc.

31:11.883 --> 31:13.866
I quote the Larry Powell piece in the L.A.

31:13.926 --> 31:21.495
Times, and he said, as much as I mourn the loss of the building, he said, but I really mourn.

31:21.475 --> 31:24.900
is the loss of the books, of the collections.

31:24.940 --> 31:26.883
He said, because it's the collections that matter.

31:27.824 --> 31:32.891
And that does more or less put it... But they didn't do violence to the identity.

31:32.931 --> 31:38.419
These things, as much as was lost, the identity of the library was not lost.

31:38.439 --> 31:41.604
Where San Francisco Public Library has a new identity now.

31:41.904 --> 31:43.146
It's a new kind of thing.

31:43.717 --> 31:50.889
You know, they maintain that the library in San Francisco has never enjoyed the kind of status as the opera and the symphony and the art museum.

31:51.289 --> 31:55.596
Whereas here in Boston, you know, the BPL is like the Boston Symphony and the Red Sox.

31:55.757 --> 31:59.423
But, you know, that's like the major in Vietnam who said we had to destroy the village.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.147
To save it.

32:02.167 --> 32:02.568
Right.

32:03.088 --> 32:10.821
Certainly the library was building through its friends in San Francisco a very growing cadre of people who were interested.

32:11.206 --> 32:14.473
And after all, it takes a couple hundred years to build a great city.

32:14.994 --> 32:22.570
Boston has been around since the 1630s and is the academic center of the United States.

32:23.412 --> 32:29.485
The fact that this frontier city of San Francisco should have reached the point where it had that distinguished building and that distinguished collection.

32:29.903 --> 32:34.047
which can be seen from another point of view as a tremendous achievement.

32:34.867 --> 32:51.703
And, you know, by the logic of Dallin and Gina Minudri that we already have sufficient research collections around here, you know, by that logic, then the BPL doesn't have to be a research library because we've got Harvard and we've got, you know, every other collection, 50 universities in the area.

32:51.723 --> 32:55.186
They should turn the BPL into an entertainment movement.

32:55.206 --> 32:56.267
Of course, don't try and do that.

32:56.287 --> 32:57.628
Try and do that.

32:57.648 --> 32:58.008
Try and do that.

32:58.028 --> 32:58.729
So it's...

32:58.709 --> 33:02.218
Basically, Nicholas, this shows something about San Francisco.

33:02.298 --> 33:07.531
San Francisco was mesmerized by all this talk of electronic this and that.

33:07.892 --> 33:10.318
San Francisco was lulled into this.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.725
People were asleep at the switch.

33:13.246 --> 33:15.672
The establishment of the city was asleep at the switch.

33:15.989 --> 33:21.838
in a way that the establishment of Los Angeles was not, and that the establishment of Boston and New York and Baltimore.

33:22.019 --> 33:23.000
Talk about Baltimore.

33:23.020 --> 33:26.746
There's an embattled city with a lot of problems, but they're proud of their library.

33:26.766 --> 33:28.148
Oh, and it's a wonderful library.

33:28.289 --> 33:29.030
It certainly is.

33:29.070 --> 33:32.115
Do you see a cautionary tale from all this?

33:32.135 --> 33:39.827
A cautionary tale is when they promise the 76 trombones, you know, when they promise... Well, no, I don't want to say that.

33:39.847 --> 33:41.029
I don't want to tack down.

33:41.049 --> 33:42.992
But the cautionary tale is that

33:43.613 --> 33:49.886
is that the whole San Francisco experience should be used as a reverse paradigm of library development.

33:49.906 --> 33:50.568
Oh, that's great.

33:51.690 --> 33:57.001
You know how you can see a sentence shaped and you can see it in type?

33:57.622 --> 33:59.266
That's a great sentence right there.

33:59.286 --> 34:00.368
Reverse paradigm.

34:00.468 --> 34:01.791
Yeah, that's really wonderful.

34:01.771 --> 34:06.077
And then did you want to comment at all on the post-occupancy evaluation?

34:06.137 --> 34:07.539
I think it pretty much speaks for itself.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.201
Yes, it speaks for itself.

34:09.862 --> 34:20.978
And, of course, it corroborates what many people like Nicholas Baker, who came under enormous personal criticism,

34:21.734 --> 34:23.599
They were jamming him.

34:23.739 --> 34:26.146
I've got everything that they called him.

34:27.469 --> 34:32.864
You know, and then Coulter, and again, I don't want you to get into a, you don't have to because I've got him saying it.

34:32.884 --> 34:37.195
You know, calling those librarians, you know, a bunch of frustrated middle-aged white women, you know.

34:37.175 --> 34:38.337
Isn't that appalling?

34:38.437 --> 34:41.381
Isn't that appalling to come from an official?

34:41.441 --> 34:42.343
You can quote me on this.

34:42.443 --> 34:51.416
What an appalling statement to come from an official of a city that prides itself on its tolerance of all varieties of the human condition.

34:51.796 --> 34:53.579
And that was to dismiss them, by the way.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.422
That was a sexist remark.

34:55.442 --> 34:56.023
It really is.

34:56.103 --> 34:58.166
It was intolerable at the state level.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.731
I mean, and...

35:02.133 --> 35:08.299
And beyond that, I asked Dallin flat out, I said, you know, there's a comment that's attributed to you.

35:08.339 --> 35:12.075
Did you actually say, after the 1989 earthquake,

35:12.427 --> 35:21.381
Now we have a great opportunity to clean out the Augean stables to compare books basically to horseshit, you know.

35:21.762 --> 35:25.308
And he said, well, this is the answer.

35:25.328 --> 35:27.812
He said, well, that quote wasn't original with me.

35:27.872 --> 35:28.914
I said, well, of course it's not.

35:28.934 --> 35:30.496
I mean, it goes back to classical times.

35:30.957 --> 35:34.983
But no, he said it was first used years ago by a San Francisco columnist.

35:35.043 --> 35:36.105
I said, but did you use it?

35:36.185 --> 35:36.626
And he did.

35:36.826 --> 35:38.108
He confirmed that he used it.

35:38.469 --> 35:38.569
Yeah.

35:39.241 --> 35:40.022
Well, there you go.

35:40.242 --> 35:50.273
I mean, if this is the attitude that a librarian has about books, that they are to be clear.

35:50.293 --> 35:55.098
And I go back and I tell you this Herculean task.

35:55.118 --> 35:59.242
He cleans out in one day these stables that have never been cleaned out.

35:59.302 --> 36:01.665
He's telling the story beautifully by putting all this together.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.747
I wrote that quote from him.

36:04.047 --> 36:05.128
And he confirmed it.

36:05.148 --> 36:06.410
Well, I'd heard it around town.

36:06.490 --> 36:08.472
The librarians had been telling me.

36:08.452 --> 36:11.440
And it was the first question I had for him.

36:11.460 --> 36:15.209
I forget if he throws me out, that's the one I want to have his answer to.

36:15.229 --> 36:16.051
He threw me out of it.

36:16.111 --> 36:16.312
He didn't.

36:16.332 --> 36:18.377
We talked for about an hour, hour and a half.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.152
Anyway, it's going to be a good chapter.

36:21.293 --> 36:25.578
And I start this chapter, by the way, in Boston with the flood, you know, last summer.

36:25.598 --> 36:28.562
And I arrive, I'm there, and here you have these librarians.

36:29.243 --> 36:33.128
They have grief counselors coming in there because they're desperate to save their collections.

36:33.148 --> 36:36.973
They have eight million books, but they're trying to save every one.

36:37.053 --> 36:42.120
And can you imagine the trauma that the San Francisco librarians felt as they saw their life work?

36:42.100 --> 36:47.455
Yeah, well, I found two pages, by the way, who witnessed it.

36:47.676 --> 36:52.549
And I have this young woman actually crying as she tells me what she saw.

36:53.457 --> 36:57.461
And then she goes up to Kathy Page and says, will you please make them stop?

36:57.481 --> 37:01.286
And she says, I'm sure your supervisor has other more important things for you to worry about.

37:01.946 --> 37:04.930
And there you have it, you know.

37:05.611 --> 37:06.431
It was a frenzy.

37:06.852 --> 37:16.883
You know, there may be, Nicholas, some kind of, not only is it a reverse paradigm, there may be some kind of bizarre...

37:17.369 --> 37:18.853
repudiation of self.

37:19.275 --> 37:20.799
Oh, this is great.

37:20.819 --> 37:26.637
That's involved here that possibly, you know, who was the man, the

37:27.697 --> 37:32.827
The sociologist down at UC San Diego, he was a wonderful, from the Frankfurt School.

37:32.947 --> 37:35.191
Oh, boy, I don't know.

37:35.512 --> 37:36.814
You know the one I'm talking about.

37:36.934 --> 37:37.776
Yeah, I do, I do.

37:37.796 --> 37:39.058
He was very big in the 60s.

37:39.699 --> 37:48.135
He said to me, he said that the middle classes, the upper middle class, he said, it was always interesting because it contained within itself the spirit of its own contradictions.

37:48.740 --> 37:52.285
At any one moment, it could completely repudiate what it was.

37:52.745 --> 37:57.051
Well, Somerset Maugham was fascinated by that in the Moon and Sixth Band, the Gauguin story.

37:58.092 --> 38:12.891
And I think that maybe there's some kind of pathology was involved in the San Francisco situation, a kind of shared collective pathology in which certain librarians, not all, but just certain librarians,

38:13.478 --> 38:26.151
basically repudiated themselves, repudiated their profession, repudiated their work in a kind of almost demonic, an almost, what's the word I want, where you're possessed.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.253
Demonic is pretty good.

38:29.675 --> 38:35.981
So that the throwing out of the books assumed a kind of quality of obscene ritual.

38:36.382 --> 38:36.662
Wow.

38:38.424 --> 38:38.524
Yeah.

38:38.504 --> 38:40.827
I don't know that, but it's a speculation.

38:40.847 --> 38:43.870
So I like to end on hopeful notes.

38:45.192 --> 38:48.476
Well, the end on hopeful notes is that no one else is doing what they did.

38:48.876 --> 38:57.907
Do you see a way out for them with this POE and with maybe rechanneling more space in this building?

38:58.929 --> 38:59.730
How could they do that?

38:59.910 --> 39:00.931
Yeah, how can they?

39:01.031 --> 39:02.753
How can they walk that building?

39:03.154 --> 39:04.275
I don't know how.

39:04.846 --> 39:09.415
The books were not... They were not... It was not a building built for books.

39:09.435 --> 39:10.978
It was not a building built for books.

39:11.359 --> 39:16.710
Now, did you ever see the video they made called The Future Library back in 1988?

39:16.730 --> 39:16.810
No.

39:16.830 --> 39:21.239
Oh, I have it, and I opened this, my piece.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.786
I just described the video, and I asked Alan, did you make this?

39:24.866 --> 39:25.808
And he said he did.

39:26.227 --> 39:26.988
It was funded.

39:27.129 --> 39:28.591
It had money from Pacific Bell.

39:28.832 --> 39:30.434
It also had money from the Department of Education.

39:30.454 --> 39:32.298
Pacific Bell, of course, Coulter was a... That's right.

39:32.318 --> 39:34.361
No, I got all this.

39:34.381 --> 39:35.043
No, I've covered it.

39:35.063 --> 39:37.727
But then I just walk you through this movie.

39:38.749 --> 39:40.332
And I describe it.

39:40.372 --> 39:42.115
And it's a robotic woman.

39:42.215 --> 39:45.501
It's a cyborg who leads you around the library.

39:45.882 --> 39:48.927
The word books, it's a 12-minute video, is only...

39:48.907 --> 39:59.636
When I first came in to the State Library, to become State Librarian in 1994, I served on a task force at San Jose State.

39:59.676 --> 40:01.982
We're trying to write a mission about library education.

40:02.022 --> 40:05.110
The word book wasn't used once in any of the other alternative write-ups.

40:05.731 --> 40:06.974
We have passed that point.

40:07.796 --> 40:16.316
Five to six years later, already the San Francisco Public Library looks like a naive mistake that we've left behind in the profession.

40:16.898 --> 40:21.529
We have reintegrated psychologically the

40:21.509 --> 40:25.455
the book with the most elaborate forms of electronic communication.

40:25.475 --> 40:26.196
Oh, that's wonderful.

40:26.497 --> 40:30.543
I asked Bill Holman what he thought, and he said, if you want to ruin a library, hire an architect.

40:31.264 --> 40:32.265
That's a very good point.

40:33.727 --> 40:35.650
Two people would not talk to me, by the way.

40:36.251 --> 40:44.023
Kathy, whatever her name is, Simon, the architect, needless to say she was defending a lawsuit at that time.

40:44.003 --> 40:48.129
And I was surprised that Marjorie Stern didn't want to talk to me.

40:48.149 --> 40:49.031
But then again... Of course not.

40:49.051 --> 40:50.172
She had Marjorie Stern.

40:50.192 --> 40:51.134
Don't quote me about her.

40:51.194 --> 40:51.574
No, no.

40:51.855 --> 40:52.275
No, no, no.

40:52.315 --> 40:53.337
You don't have to, by the way.

40:53.597 --> 40:58.064
But she must feel terrible about this whole thing.

40:58.084 --> 40:58.525
I think so.

40:58.565 --> 40:59.706
She was very gracious to me.

40:59.726 --> 41:04.654
She said, Mr. Bazbaines, I wish you well on what you're doing, but I think I don't want to talk to you.

41:04.794 --> 41:07.919
And I said, Mr. Stern, I don't blame you, actually.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.643
Because you put her whole soul in this thing.

41:10.663 --> 41:10.803
Yep.

41:10.883 --> 41:10.963
Yep.

41:10.983 --> 41:11.885
I must have broken her up.

41:12.185 --> 41:12.846
Absolutely.

41:12.826 --> 41:14.949
I will never say anything against her.

41:14.969 --> 41:15.570
She's a fine man.

41:15.670 --> 41:16.732
Oh, no, she's not really.

41:16.752 --> 41:21.179
And, you know, I give Dowling his day.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.721
I mean, I interview him.

41:22.921 --> 41:25.786
I give Coulter his day.

41:25.806 --> 41:26.426
I quote him.

41:26.447 --> 41:28.570
This is going to be a great chapter, I have to say.

41:28.590 --> 41:29.571
I'm excited.

41:29.611 --> 41:33.417
And having had this conversation with you, I would have been totally remiss.

41:33.397 --> 41:37.505
I haven't gone ahead and not had these observations of yours.

41:38.067 --> 41:40.872
Now, would you like to talk a little bit about the state library?

41:41.053 --> 41:41.554
Yeah, sure.

41:42.055 --> 41:45.341
All right, because you asked the first question, do other states have libraries like this?

41:45.361 --> 41:53.498
The answer is no, with the exception of a few states, but no library, the California State Library, in terms of its budget and its holdings.

41:53.478 --> 41:59.852
Now, New York State, I understand that they are actually an ARL library, so they must have a pretty good library in New York.

41:59.913 --> 42:00.314
Absolutely.

42:00.454 --> 42:00.975
I'm going to say that.

42:00.995 --> 42:01.957
It's in a league.

42:02.037 --> 42:08.452
California State Library is in a league with New York, I think with Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois.

42:10.777 --> 42:11.098
Um...

42:11.720 --> 42:16.146
Now, we here in Massachusetts probably don't need such a thing.

42:16.166 --> 42:19.271
I mean, we have wonderful libraries up and down.

42:19.311 --> 42:28.965
Don't forget the California State Library functioned as the single comprehensive library in the state until the rise of the university and public libraries in the turn of the century.

42:29.766 --> 42:36.215
So that's why we have in public possession the Audubon Double Elephant Folio, the Nuremberg Chronicle.

42:36.576 --> 42:37.857
That's why we have all those things.

42:37.897 --> 42:39.360
Dad, did you do that for me again?

42:39.760 --> 42:41.102
That's very important to me.

42:41.082 --> 42:44.867
Why do you have a Nuremberg Chronicle and an elephant folio?

42:45.068 --> 42:47.151
The Audubon double elephant folio.

42:47.191 --> 42:49.574
Yeah, but I know what that is, but how is it that you have one?

42:49.594 --> 43:02.432
The reason we have those treasures is that we were the single comprehensive library in the state until the rise of the public and university libraries after 1900.

43:02.412 --> 43:07.738
In other words, for about 50 years, the major library in California was the California State Library.

43:07.758 --> 43:09.961
And you were collecting rare things.

43:09.981 --> 43:12.283
People to Europe in the 1860s to buy.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.085
We bought in classics.

43:14.125 --> 43:15.126
We bought in the literature.

43:15.186 --> 43:16.448
We bought in the fine arts.

43:16.788 --> 43:21.013
Is there a dominant figure who stands out in that period that you can think of offhand?

43:22.955 --> 43:24.357
Which of my predecessors, no.

43:24.877 --> 43:30.664
Yeah, that is pretty... No, but if you...

43:30.948 --> 43:35.575
You call the California State Library and talk to Gary Kurutz, K-U-R-U-T-Z.

43:35.595 --> 43:35.955
Okay.

43:36.195 --> 43:45.288
He is our librarian, Special Collections, and he is now preparing a beautiful catalog for us called Treasures of the California State Library.

43:45.308 --> 43:45.489
Oh, good.

43:45.509 --> 43:46.711
I'll call him.

43:46.731 --> 43:52.559
Call him, and he will give you the names of those librarians who traveled on our behalf in the 1860s, 70s.

43:52.579 --> 43:53.781
Okay, yeah.

43:53.801 --> 43:59.689
And because this great frontier state wanted to, and I did a preface to...

44:00.277 --> 44:12.758
I did a preface to this catalog in which I said that this great frontier state wanted to serve its local instrumental needs, but also wanted to invoke the world as the library can invoke the Plenum Mundi.

44:12.979 --> 44:14.321
When are they going to publish this catalog?

44:14.341 --> 44:16.104
It's going to be published in January.

44:16.525 --> 44:17.106
I'll cite it.

44:17.146 --> 44:17.927
That's why I'm asking.

44:17.987 --> 44:19.951
I'll be happy to cite it in my bibliography.

44:20.011 --> 44:20.331
No, but wait.

44:20.391 --> 44:22.555
He can send you a copy of it.

44:22.923 --> 44:23.784
in manuscript.

44:25.045 --> 44:27.488
I guarantee you it'll get into my book.

44:27.628 --> 44:28.689
Will you call him?

44:28.850 --> 44:29.430
Yeah, sure.

44:29.470 --> 44:30.712
Gary K-U-R.

44:31.112 --> 44:32.113
K-U-R-U-T-Z.

44:32.313 --> 44:32.974
U-T-Z.

44:33.074 --> 44:35.036
I'll have to just call your office up in Sacramento.

44:35.056 --> 44:35.377
Call my office.

44:35.397 --> 44:36.818
Have him transfer over to Gary Kurutz.

44:37.279 --> 44:38.260
Tell him you've talked to me.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.022
I'm in Los Angeles now.

44:40.222 --> 44:41.163
Okay.

44:41.183 --> 44:43.025
And tell him to give a talk.

44:43.386 --> 44:46.709
And tell him to send you the manuscript instead of for your citation.

44:46.729 --> 44:46.809
Yep.

44:47.190 --> 44:48.811
And it will be used.

44:48.831 --> 44:49.052
My preface.

44:49.112 --> 44:49.933
Tell him to send you my preface.

44:49.953 --> 44:50.453
Absolutely.

44:50.774 --> 44:52.035
This is terrific.

44:52.015 --> 44:54.399
I think we've covered the high points.

44:55.461 --> 44:57.484
You are a thorough researcher.

44:57.504 --> 44:58.045
That's just one.

44:58.065 --> 45:00.008
I don't mean to be patronizing.

45:00.028 --> 45:02.492
I love to see somebody just soak up the stuff.

45:02.652 --> 45:07.140
Well, I have to say this book's taken five years, and it probably should have been done three years ago.

45:07.160 --> 45:08.021
Isn't it fun?

45:08.782 --> 45:11.367
It's the greatest thing, you know, and I'm changing publishers.

45:11.387 --> 45:17.196
The San Francisco Public Library will be very contentious, and I think the idea of what have we learned from it

45:17.176 --> 45:20.320
And that's where my reverse paradigm comes in.

45:20.702 --> 45:22.798
We've learned what to avoid.

45:23.656 --> 45:26.359
It's terrific.

45:26.599 --> 45:33.006
I've really devoted a lot more words to it than I probably should, but my new publisher says, write as many words as you want.

45:33.146 --> 45:35.348
You booked it well, I hope, your first book.

45:36.109 --> 45:37.631
It's still in print and hardcover.

45:37.651 --> 45:43.157
It's got 60,000 copies in print, and HarperCollins is going to do the new book.

45:43.957 --> 45:47.301
I'm leaving Holt for a variety of reasons.

45:48.192 --> 45:50.676
I'm really excited about the new book.

45:50.696 --> 45:51.337
That's great.

45:51.577 --> 45:52.839
And I really love your stuff.

45:53.380 --> 45:54.802
I'm looking at your book right now.

45:55.864 --> 45:58.708
And I think maybe if you want... Material dreams.

45:59.029 --> 46:05.919
Yes, if you want to mention the fact that about the profession of librarianship, I'd like to go into this for just a second.

46:05.939 --> 46:06.540
Yes, very important.

46:06.560 --> 46:09.545
We must maintain these substantive relationships to our field.

46:09.926 --> 46:13.491
Say, for instance, if we ever want to get the librarianship of Congress back...

46:14.298 --> 46:20.250
We've got to develop scholar librarians that can attract the attention of the president of the United States.

46:20.872 --> 46:22.395
Now, what do you mean?

46:22.655 --> 46:32.195
If we want to get the library, I mean, do you think it's a good idea or do you think that maybe having a scholar like that?

46:32.235 --> 46:35.682
Now, wait, what if we had first rate scholars who are also librarians?

46:36.117 --> 46:39.848
like Borges down in Argentina, for instance, or wherever.

46:40.911 --> 46:44.200
Our father Boyle, Leonard Boyle, at the Vatican is a perfect example.

46:44.220 --> 46:47.008
Now, then don't quote it that way if we want to get it back.

46:47.028 --> 46:48.793
But if we want to be considered...

46:49.583 --> 46:57.920
If the library profession wants to be considered for the directorship of distinguished libraries, then it must produce scholar librarians.

46:58.662 --> 46:59.604
I'll stay with that quote.

46:59.624 --> 47:01.007
That's terrific.

47:01.027 --> 47:06.478
Because I am, the scholar librarian is of particular interest.
