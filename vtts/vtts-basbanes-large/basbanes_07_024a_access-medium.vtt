00:04.199 --> 00:04.880
Say hello.

00:05.380 --> 00:05.801
Hello.

00:06.161 --> 00:08.144
And tell me who you are, please.

00:08.164 --> 00:09.285
Okay, my name is Rita Smith.

00:10.687 --> 00:10.787
Okay.

00:10.807 --> 00:12.089
And your title?

00:13.290 --> 00:22.001
Um, I am called an instructor librarian at the University of Florida, and I'm the project cataloger for the Baldwin Library.

00:22.021 --> 00:22.121
Okay.

00:23.042 --> 00:27.107
And we just add that today is December 14, 1990.

00:27.328 --> 00:27.969
Okay.

00:30.372 --> 00:31.573
So, and...

00:32.110 --> 00:35.354
Smith, how long have you been here at the university?

00:35.374 --> 00:37.957
Let's start with some basic stuff.

00:37.977 --> 00:41.262
OK, I've been with the Baldwin Library for about a year and a half.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.767
I started in August of 89.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.695
And before that, I had worked for a couple of years with the library, but not on a continuing basis.

00:53.857 --> 00:58.303
How extensive are the special collections holdings here, would you say?

00:59.752 --> 01:01.994
Well, I really can only speak for the Baldwin.

01:02.775 --> 01:05.618
There are five sections of the special collections.

01:06.239 --> 01:08.801
There's rare books and manuscripts.

01:08.821 --> 01:25.338
There's university archives, the Library of Florida History, the Belknap Collection, which is a theater arts collection, and the Baldwin Library, which is children's literature.

01:25.358 --> 01:27.700
The Baldwin Library, according to Bernie,

01:28.827 --> 01:33.431
is really the great centerpiece collection.

01:35.953 --> 01:38.375
Well, I think that's his vision of it, and I'm glad of it.

01:38.555 --> 01:46.322
It hasn't really taken its place as sort of the star of the collection by any means.

01:47.223 --> 01:58.412
It's probably the most unique in that there are more art items here that people cannot find in the Baldwin that people couldn't find in other children's collections.

01:59.388 --> 02:03.755
So, you know, we see the possible constituency really an international one.

02:09.845 --> 02:16.455
But it hasn't been used as much as the other special collections, and I can go into those problems at some point, too.

02:16.476 --> 02:20.682
Well, why don't we... but you really haven't had the Bolo collection that long.

02:20.702 --> 02:23.106
Well, we've had it since the late 70s.

02:23.467 --> 02:24.248
Oh, really?

02:25.072 --> 02:26.573
Do you want me to start at the beginning?

02:26.593 --> 02:26.694
Yeah.

02:26.714 --> 02:26.934
Okay.

02:26.994 --> 02:30.177
I was just trying to get into this, and I would actually prefer that you did.

02:30.197 --> 02:30.417
Yeah.

02:30.557 --> 02:30.858
Okay.

02:30.878 --> 02:34.021
Well... You can tell me a little bit about the lady and... All right.

02:34.041 --> 02:42.369
The whole thing started in the early 50s when Dr. Baldwin got... Could you give me her full name, please?

02:42.389 --> 02:42.509
Okay.

02:42.549 --> 02:43.530
Her name is Ruth Marie.

02:43.950 --> 02:45.332
Ruth Marie Baldwin.

02:46.673 --> 02:50.657
And her father was a Shakespeare scholar at the University of Illinois.

02:52.319 --> 02:53.880
And so she grew up in Champaign-Urbana.

02:54.502 --> 03:03.114
two sisters, and her father, in his studies, made trips over to England every year, or very frequently.

03:03.154 --> 03:21.960
And on one of these visits in 1953, for Christmas, I believe, Dr. and Mrs. Baldwin sent Ruth about, oh, maybe 20 children's books that they had found at book dealers in London.

03:22.598 --> 03:26.786
And her father suggested that this would be a nice thing for a woman to collect.

03:27.086 --> 03:28.148
Or even a girl.

03:28.188 --> 03:29.330
Was she a girl at that time?

03:29.571 --> 03:34.300
She would have been... I think she was born around 1917.

03:35.201 --> 03:35.462
Okay.

03:37.025 --> 03:37.866
Okay, so a woman.

03:39.149 --> 03:40.151
Yeah.

03:40.832 --> 03:44.138
Very patronizing attitude, right?

03:46.182 --> 03:46.362
Right.

03:47.202 --> 03:52.947
So she took him up on this, I guess, because from then on, that was the total focus of her life.

03:53.068 --> 03:54.309
And she was a librarian.

03:55.450 --> 03:59.614
She taught for many years in the School of Library Science at Louisiana State University.

04:00.895 --> 04:01.656
She never married.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.357
Of course, never had any children.

04:04.398 --> 04:07.381
And this was really the total focus of her life.

04:07.441 --> 04:09.523
And she was mainly interested in 19th century books.

04:09.863 --> 04:13.767
That's what she was focusing on, 19th century children's books, British and American.

04:14.742 --> 04:27.341
And from 1953 through the late 70s, maybe 1978, she had collected between 35,000 and 40,000 children's books, and she had them in her house at Baton Rouge.

04:28.704 --> 04:31.608
That's about a 25-year period.

04:33.291 --> 04:40.682
How she happened to bring them to Florida at that point was a university professor, Joy Anderson,

04:41.202 --> 04:41.643
Joy.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.764
Joy, J-O-Y.

04:42.784 --> 04:46.468
She's an English professor who taught children's literature and writing of children's literature.

04:46.488 --> 04:49.792
She was at LSU for some kind of symposium or something.

04:49.812 --> 04:50.934
She met Dr. Baldwin.

04:50.954 --> 04:52.476
Dr. Baldwin took her to her home.

04:53.357 --> 04:56.480
And Joy saw this fabulous collection.

04:56.821 --> 05:03.249
And that's when she decided that it would be good, when Joy decided, wouldn't this be a wonderful thing to have at the University of Florida?

05:03.309 --> 05:09.336
Dr. Baldwin at that point hadn't, as far as I know, gone out of her way to search for a place to put the collection.

05:10.649 --> 05:17.177
So Joy came back and talked to the director of the libraries and told them what a fabulous collection was squirreled away in a house in Baton Rouge.

05:17.877 --> 05:19.339
Squirreled away in a house in Baton Rouge.

05:19.619 --> 05:22.963
And, yeah, apparently they'd... What was she doing in Baton Rouge at this point?

05:22.983 --> 05:25.847
She was a professor in the library school.

05:25.867 --> 05:30.091
Where did she get her education, by the way?

05:30.111 --> 05:31.653
Where did she get her PhD?

05:31.673 --> 05:32.414
Probably Illinois.

05:32.815 --> 05:35.718
Okay, so she is a Midwestern woman then himself.

05:35.878 --> 05:36.179
Yeah, right.

05:36.319 --> 05:36.559
Okay.

05:38.261 --> 05:38.361
Yeah.

05:39.016 --> 05:45.686
I think she spent some time in South Dakota immediately after library school, and also some time in California.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.732
But she spent 20 years or so teaching at Louisiana State.

05:50.954 --> 06:03.572
And her parents continued to live in Champaign, and they retired from University of Illinois and went to Carbondale, and that's where they've lived the last 10 years or so of their life.

06:04.565 --> 06:18.681
So Joy went back, I think, to Baton Rouge with maybe the director of the library and some other interested persons, and they agreed that this would be a wonderful addition to the libraries.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.243
And I'm not sure what details were worked out.

06:21.283 --> 06:24.947
If you want documents and things, I suppose we could find them for you.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.190
This doesn't necessarily have to be done today.

06:27.210 --> 06:29.172
Right, yeah.

06:29.455 --> 06:36.222
But what turned out is that she brought it to the University of Florida, and it was approximately 35,000 to 40,000 19th century children's books.

06:37.223 --> 06:38.805
And this is about the late 50s?

06:38.825 --> 06:39.466
1978.

06:39.846 --> 06:40.627
I'm sorry.

06:40.647 --> 06:40.787
78.

06:40.807 --> 06:42.249
Yeah, she started in the early 50s.

06:42.289 --> 06:46.173
She was a private collector, definitely, through the late 70s.

06:46.253 --> 06:49.637
And then in 78 or 9, she brought the collection to the University of Florida.

06:49.697 --> 06:52.460
So it was housed here at about that time.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.062
It moved here to the University.

06:54.082 --> 06:57.145
Right, from Baton Rouge.

06:57.165 --> 06:57.285
Right.

06:57.586 --> 07:00.610
Did she retain any kind of a control over it?

07:00.630 --> 07:01.291
She was curator.

07:01.331 --> 07:04.154
She was hired by the University of Florida to be the curator.

07:05.877 --> 07:12.986
She was also offered staff and a certain location in the library, you know, for them to go.

07:13.787 --> 07:21.096
And then over the next 10 years, 10 or 11 years, she added another 40,000 books.

07:21.437 --> 07:22.198
Oh, God.

07:22.218 --> 07:22.939
With her own funds?

07:23.339 --> 07:24.741
No, this was with the library's funds.

07:24.801 --> 07:25.502
Well, and her own.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.243
I mean...

07:27.286 --> 07:33.255
These buying trips that she went on, every vacation, every Saturday, she'd hit the garage sales.

07:33.275 --> 07:36.600
Every weekend, she'd be down at book dealers in Ocala.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.101
Did you know her?

07:37.602 --> 07:39.805
Yeah, I worked with her for six months before she died.

07:39.825 --> 07:42.189
We've got to talk about that, too.

07:42.209 --> 07:43.531
Go ahead.

07:43.551 --> 07:50.000
So then over the next 10 or 11 years, she added about the same number of books, and she expanded into the 20th century to 1950.

07:50.081 --> 07:55.048
So when she died, just about a year ago, the collection,

07:55.349 --> 08:01.175
was from approximately 1800 to 1950, that span of years, 80,000 children's books.

08:03.798 --> 08:07.922
And her definition of a children's book was a book that was read by children.

08:08.803 --> 08:25.120
So although most of them are, you know, like for 15, 16, 17 and under, there are some books that most people wouldn't consider juvenile books, but she included them and bought them because she figured children would have read them.

08:25.977 --> 08:33.164
Also, she always wanted books that were read by children rather than books that had not been read by children.

08:33.204 --> 08:35.045
That's why she didn't go after first editions.

08:36.567 --> 08:40.130
She wasn't interested in the quote-unquote rare, valuable book.

08:40.631 --> 08:43.453
To her, a valuable book was one that children had actually read.

08:43.473 --> 08:54.904
So if she had a choice between two copies of a book, one was in pristine, clean condition, no corners damaged, the dust jacket on,

08:55.475 --> 09:00.742
$500, and the other one had been thumb and red and had a child's name in the front.

09:01.203 --> 09:02.525
That's the one she wanted to buy.

09:03.346 --> 09:05.269
Did she explain her thinking of that?

09:08.093 --> 09:12.419
Because as an artifact, you probably want the pristine copy.

09:12.579 --> 09:14.982
Well, she wasn't interested in artifacts at all.

09:15.022 --> 09:21.111
But there must have come a point where she's at a university, and she knows that she is building a library.

09:22.407 --> 09:24.949
that ideally you should have the perfect copy.

09:25.009 --> 09:26.170
Wouldn't you think so?

09:26.711 --> 09:29.474
Well, that's another thing about her.

09:29.554 --> 09:34.638
She never saw herself as building a library for anyone other than herself.

09:35.579 --> 09:37.681
She still was the collector.

09:37.701 --> 09:43.426
She's got every symptom that you can possibly name.

09:45.428 --> 09:46.609
It's wonderful.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.331
Did she articulate this?

09:48.431 --> 09:50.693
No, she didn't really articulate it, but

09:50.943 --> 09:52.785
Actions often speak louder than words.

09:53.285 --> 09:59.112
And it was obvious to me that all of these books were hers yet.

09:59.812 --> 10:00.893
This was her collection.

10:01.274 --> 10:03.776
And she saw it as her collection and her books.

10:03.796 --> 10:11.024
And she didn't see it as building a library for use by people or even scholars.

10:11.425 --> 10:11.685
Right.

10:12.345 --> 10:17.711
Do you think still in her mind she saw this as a library of books for children?

10:19.313 --> 10:20.494
Not to be used by children.

10:20.997 --> 10:25.664
Once they entered the collection, they were... Children were off limits.

10:26.785 --> 10:29.149
Absolutely off limits.

10:29.409 --> 10:31.332
Is that a rule, by the way?

10:31.552 --> 10:31.792
Yeah.

10:32.233 --> 10:42.528
I mean, my daughter, when I started working here, this is strictly a personal thing, but the first week I was hired, it was very quickly done, and I didn't have child care for my daughter, who's 10.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.552
Very well behaved.

10:45.572 --> 10:47.815
And so I had to bring her one afternoon.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.941
She would not let her sit at a table inside the library.

10:51.981 --> 10:56.048
She had to sit at a table outside in the reading room.

10:56.549 --> 10:58.091
I mean, she wasn't going to touch the books.

10:58.753 --> 11:02.259
She wasn't going to look at them or anything, but she couldn't even sit.

11:02.339 --> 11:05.945
The child was ten at the time.

11:06.005 --> 11:08.730
My daughters are nine and eight as we speak, so I'm just curious.

11:10.393 --> 11:12.496
They revere books.

11:12.516 --> 11:13.498
My children.

11:13.782 --> 11:21.711
Oh, Rachel wouldn't have done a thing to them, but I knew enough after two days not even to suggest that she let Rachel even look at them.

11:21.731 --> 11:27.917
Was it stated by the woman, or did you just do something that you just understood?

11:27.937 --> 11:31.321
Well, yeah, I understood that.

11:32.122 --> 11:41.292
I knew sort of what she was like before I started working here, and she was very protective.

11:41.845 --> 11:45.689
gave the feeling that she really didn't want anybody to use these books.

11:47.211 --> 11:52.016
And I don't know, you just knew that... I mean, I knew that Rachel could never go up and look at a book.

11:53.879 --> 11:58.624
But the fact that she couldn't even sit in the library at a table was really amazing.

12:00.306 --> 12:03.309
Is there a contradiction here, a paradox, in your mind?

12:05.552 --> 12:09.456
Or is it just an irony that I see that...

12:09.807 --> 12:15.613
She really coveted the books that were used by the kids once they entered the collection.

12:17.255 --> 12:19.938
And yet, did she like kids, did you think?

12:20.599 --> 12:20.799
No.

12:22.981 --> 12:24.603
She didn't have any children.

12:25.064 --> 12:26.485
Her two sisters never married.

12:26.525 --> 12:27.767
They never had any children.

12:27.907 --> 12:31.070
I think she was never ever around children.

12:32.091 --> 12:36.456
She probably would have been extremely uncomfortable if she had been.

12:39.018 --> 12:43.903
And it's really interesting, because one of her sisters went to England after the war and worked in orphanages.

12:44.784 --> 12:47.226
She was this passionate collector of children's books.

12:47.306 --> 12:49.448
And her third sister is a kindergarten teacher.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.252
The other sister collected books, too, did you say?

12:53.592 --> 12:53.792
No.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.033
No, I'm sorry.

12:55.053 --> 12:56.775
Ruth was the collector of children's books.

12:58.156 --> 12:59.278
And the third one was a kindergarten teacher.

12:59.298 --> 13:03.422
So they all had some connection to children, although Ruth was the most removed.

13:03.782 --> 13:08.046
Well, the other two seemed to interact quite directly.

13:08.414 --> 13:10.036
With the kids.

13:10.377 --> 13:15.463
But Ruth was just adamant that it was a book, a collection of children's books, but not for children.

13:15.503 --> 13:20.790
It's almost like a laboratory kind of thing.

13:22.312 --> 13:25.536
But then, you know, a lot of, she discouraged use even by scholars.

13:25.856 --> 13:31.564
And, you know, we, undergraduate classes, she didn't want undergraduates pawing through her books either.

13:31.624 --> 13:33.306
So.

13:33.807 --> 13:34.928
How did she talk about them?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.291
How did she talk about her?

13:37.311 --> 13:39.834
I mean, was there a parent passion for the books?

13:40.054 --> 13:45.780
Well, she liked having them, but her love was getting them.

13:46.741 --> 13:49.063
Okay.

13:49.083 --> 13:49.303
The hunt.

13:49.764 --> 13:51.305
The hunt and getting it.

13:51.325 --> 13:58.192
She was on all these catalog books would come here, book dealer catalogs.

13:58.913 --> 14:03.818
The morning they arrived, she would open them up and check to see what she had.

14:04.608 --> 14:06.891
and what she didn't have and what she wanted.

14:07.752 --> 14:09.575
She'd do that in the space of about two hours.

14:10.796 --> 14:16.664
And late in the morning or early afternoon, she was on the phone to the book dealer telling him which books she wanted.

14:18.446 --> 14:20.349
And a week later, they would arrive.

14:20.409 --> 14:26.157
But her interest in them was done in a lot of ways.

14:26.377 --> 14:27.699
She gave them to someone else, the cattle.

14:27.719 --> 14:28.380
I could do their meat.

14:28.420 --> 14:29.581
So staff handled it.

14:30.903 --> 14:31.003
Yeah.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.296
Didn't she go and handle it?

14:34.316 --> 14:36.338
Didn't she want to go and feel it at least and see it?

14:36.438 --> 14:38.820
Well, yeah, she liked unpacking them.

14:40.061 --> 14:43.224
But her interest, you know, she was on to other things.

14:43.244 --> 14:45.406
She was on to something new to buy.

14:45.426 --> 14:50.411
I don't know how to define that or how to talk about it, really.

14:51.312 --> 14:58.319
Because I don't want to sound like she didn't like them or that she didn't love having them.

14:58.819 --> 15:01.902
But her interest dropped off.

15:02.523 --> 15:06.567
Okay, there are two collections of Boston University.

15:08.468 --> 15:20.519
Paul Richards, both given by Paul Richards, who's a very active guy in his late 40s, about 50, who's one of the two largest dealers of autographs in the United States.

15:21.340 --> 15:22.201
And he's a collector.

15:22.381 --> 15:27.366
But for him, once he gets a Robert Frost item or a Teddy Roosevelt, now he's building a book.

15:27.386 --> 15:32.310
He totally loses his interest, and then he gives it to Boston University.

15:32.425 --> 15:33.786
But it's the hunt.

15:33.986 --> 15:36.909
It's precisely the syndrome that you're describing.

15:36.989 --> 15:37.910
That's exactly it.

15:37.950 --> 15:40.072
It's the excitement of finding it and getting it.

15:40.092 --> 15:42.094
And it is not unique, trust me.

15:42.114 --> 15:46.638
It is very symptomatic of certain species of bibliopaniacs.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.983
Describe her for me physically.

15:51.223 --> 15:52.104
What did she look like?

15:53.185 --> 15:55.247
She was not particularly tall.

15:55.267 --> 15:57.489
She was a little bit shorter than I am.

15:57.529 --> 16:01.993
She was stout, but not overweight by any means.

16:02.615 --> 16:07.400
She had short, grayish hair.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.481
I don't know.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.564
Her personality was extremely forceful.

16:12.966 --> 16:22.796
And when you said she went on these trips, were they just like around here?

16:22.856 --> 16:28.582
Did she go on really book scouting, elaborate book scouting trips?

16:28.602 --> 16:31.845
Well, everywhere she went was a book scouting trip.

16:32.551 --> 16:44.142
no matter what the other motive for going was, whether it was a vacation, she and her family had a cabin up by the Indian River in Michigan.

16:45.943 --> 16:47.044
And they'd go up there every year.

16:47.084 --> 16:54.951
And in every city, or in many cities along the way, they would stop and visit the bookstores in the cities and see what they could find.

16:57.674 --> 17:01.157
And of course, when she went to England to visit her sister,

17:01.643 --> 17:03.625
And she went around to a lot of the bookstores.

17:04.266 --> 17:11.913
I would hear her on the phone calling some of her friends, you know, saying, why don't we go down and visit this bookstore in Ocala or Orlando and we can have lunch or something.

17:11.953 --> 17:15.357
So it was just part of her.

17:17.719 --> 17:21.723
I don't think she may have earlier.

17:21.743 --> 17:24.026
See, I didn't know her until six months before she died.

17:24.206 --> 17:29.972
Did you find all these?

17:30.012 --> 17:30.873
No.

17:30.893 --> 17:31.313
Oh, OK.

17:32.322 --> 17:34.124
All right.

17:34.765 --> 17:40.974
Okay, we'll put these right there on that.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.983
So you knew her for the final six months of her life.

17:48.344 --> 17:50.988
Did you find any apathy at that point?

17:51.809 --> 17:59.359
Or do you think that she was probably as committed then as she had been, say, from the beginning of the collecting back in the 50s?

18:01.853 --> 18:04.156
Well, I didn't find any apathy.

18:04.657 --> 18:09.624
I mean, she would still get up morning, Saturday morning, and do the garage sale.

18:10.545 --> 18:13.188
Monday morning she'd have a pile of books that she had purchased.

18:14.550 --> 18:19.237
She was also still going around local places, Orlando, Ocala.

18:19.257 --> 18:23.242
Gamble isn't big on bookstores, but she would still do that.

18:23.643 --> 18:26.747
And, of course, she was real active searching the catalogs.

18:27.419 --> 18:28.380
She'd come in every day.

18:28.420 --> 18:29.881
She had technically retired in 1988.

18:30.001 --> 18:32.984
This was August of 89 when they hired me.

18:33.825 --> 18:37.488
She'd come in every day and search the catalogs.

18:38.189 --> 18:38.849
She wouldn't let it go?

18:39.210 --> 18:39.930
She couldn't let it go.

18:42.352 --> 18:50.420
But while she was still alive, did you kind of have any freedom to try and get this collection into the world of scholarship?

18:51.281 --> 18:51.481
No.

18:52.722 --> 18:56.245
Her influence was still such that

18:57.254 --> 19:02.159
We had to wait, which an institution can afford to do.

19:02.259 --> 19:03.760
I mean, that's the way it goes.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.502
That's the trade-off.

19:05.522 --> 19:06.423
We get it.

19:06.743 --> 19:08.505
You're not telling me anything I haven't.

19:09.466 --> 19:15.331
I feel like a physician now who's taking a case history, because I've seen this kind of thing happen now.

19:16.052 --> 19:23.259
85,000 or so books, yet apparently she knew everything that she had.

19:24.440 --> 19:24.840
She did.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.502
She knew an awful lot of what she had.

19:26.887 --> 19:31.011
I mean, is there any duplication so far as you can see?

19:31.031 --> 19:32.472
No.

19:32.492 --> 19:36.836
So she could pick up a catalog and see an item, and she knew immediately whether or not she had it.

19:37.296 --> 19:40.899
I think she never verbalized that to me, and she did spend some time.

19:40.919 --> 19:43.842
She has a card catalog that she would check.

19:43.862 --> 19:49.547
But I think she had a general idea, well, even more than that, of what she had and what she didn't have.

19:50.628 --> 19:53.150
Did she ever articulate things that she really wanted?

19:54.951 --> 19:56.893
Did she have a want list, a wish list?

19:57.076 --> 19:59.399
She didn't like to operate from wantless.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.985
That may be sort of just an impression I have rather than anything she specifically told me.

20:05.025 --> 20:11.732
Or maybe I've read, I believe she had a policy statement that says that she doesn't operate from wantless.

20:13.054 --> 20:20.282
I'm hoping that you can get a package of these things together for me, these things, these printed things that describe

20:21.207 --> 20:24.371
I may have to wait until Bernie comes back.

20:25.031 --> 20:28.335
Well, you did mention to me that you had a number of things that I could get.

20:28.355 --> 20:32.980
I don't feel like on my own I can go and get all this stuff and fend it off.

20:33.201 --> 20:34.402
But, you know, I can talk to him.

20:34.863 --> 20:41.390
And if it's fine with him, I can do some... The story's going to need more than an interview, obviously.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.812
It's going to need some stuff.

20:42.832 --> 20:46.696
And you must have some articles that have been written about her.

20:46.876 --> 20:47.797
Not many of them.

20:47.817 --> 20:50.961
But if there are policy statements, well, that's where I come in.

20:51.228 --> 21:00.258
90% of the people I'm writing about were relatively anonymous, outside of this fraternity and sorority type of a thing.

21:03.241 --> 21:03.882
Where were we?

21:04.783 --> 21:09.869
She didn't have a want list that you could... No.

21:10.690 --> 21:13.913
I don't know.

21:13.933 --> 21:17.337
I think once you get a look at the collection, you'll realize how

21:18.245 --> 21:19.926
omnivorous she was.

21:19.986 --> 21:30.135
I mean, we can get, now we get these catalogs from rare book dealers and we can go through them and she's got 70% of what they're offering, some of them.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.677
Did she ever articulate the focus of the collection?

21:34.199 --> 21:39.964
I mean, you said 18th and 19th and now some 20th century books for children.

21:40.004 --> 21:47.610
Well, she was particularly proud of parallel editions in American and British editions of the same book.

21:48.772 --> 21:53.419
But there was no subject focus.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.302
There was no format focus.

21:58.867 --> 22:06.258
Her focus was anything that was read by children in the 19th century was valuable to her.

22:06.298 --> 22:07.820
It was worth having for the collection.

22:08.942 --> 22:09.923
She's got chapbooks.

22:09.963 --> 22:11.185
She's got religious literature.

22:11.245 --> 22:12.567
She's got ABC books.

22:12.647 --> 22:14.670
She's got toy and movable books.

22:15.872 --> 22:17.074
She has etiquette books.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.663
She has textbooks.

22:19.683 --> 22:30.540
She has thousands of novels written after little women, family stories, tracks.

22:31.321 --> 22:36.028
And for 25 years this stuff was crammed into her place in Baton Rouge.

22:36.769 --> 22:41.897
Bernie said that she has a sister alive that you might

22:42.569 --> 22:44.872
Give me her name, and maybe I could talk to her at some point.

22:44.892 --> 22:45.714
Well, actually, she's got two.

22:45.754 --> 22:46.515
The one's in England.

22:46.535 --> 22:47.937
Her name is Elizabeth.

22:47.977 --> 22:49.399
I don't know hardly anything about her.

22:49.419 --> 22:51.682
The other sister lives in Chester, Illinois.

22:51.862 --> 22:56.128
She's a kindergarten teacher, whom I've met several times.

22:57.591 --> 22:59.453
What's the name of the other one?

22:59.473 --> 22:59.954
Cynthia.

23:01.096 --> 23:01.276
Cynthia.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.618
And she lives in Chester, Illinois?

23:02.638 --> 23:03.399
Chester, Illinois.

23:03.419 --> 23:04.220
Cynthia Baldwin.

23:09.608 --> 23:12.492
Do you have any objection to my calling her, in fact, with my sister?

23:12.995 --> 23:13.636
I don't know.

23:15.138 --> 23:17.261
I don't know how she would react.

23:20.005 --> 23:22.708
Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there?

23:23.970 --> 23:24.791
It could be negative.

23:25.392 --> 23:25.893
That's fine.

23:26.393 --> 23:30.579
I mean, it's not fine, but it's not... I'm a big boy.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.064
I have people telling me they don't want to talk to me.

23:34.084 --> 23:40.012
They say things that... But I think I owe it to the book to try.

23:40.072 --> 23:41.314
Well, I'm sure she could give you...

23:41.530 --> 23:43.812
Is she listed, you think, on the phone?

23:43.872 --> 23:44.733
Oh, yeah.

23:44.753 --> 23:47.415
I would imagine she is.

23:47.435 --> 23:48.156
Cynthia Baldwin?

23:48.176 --> 23:49.237
Cynthia Baldwin, yeah.

23:49.577 --> 23:50.518
In Chester, Illinois?

23:51.458 --> 23:51.599
Mm-hmm.

23:51.619 --> 23:52.399
Down on the river.

23:52.419 --> 23:53.160
Down on the river.

23:53.420 --> 23:55.142
See, I was out there in October.

23:55.162 --> 23:55.382
Yeah.

23:58.444 --> 23:58.925
Okay.

24:00.826 --> 24:02.868
I don't know if we need this on tape.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.150
If you really want me to go off, I will.

24:07.892 --> 24:11.115
Okay, well, she was a very... She was stubborn.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.135
for one thing.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.918
She was pretty full of herself.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.883
She was very important to herself, very important.

24:21.706 --> 24:24.429
She was often uncooperative.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.712
She was occasionally downright rude.

24:29.234 --> 24:40.647
She was hard for many people to work with.

24:40.863 --> 24:46.549
All of which made it difficult for people to use the collection.

24:49.973 --> 24:54.478
They sort of had to get past her first, which was a very hard thing to do.

24:56.380 --> 24:57.541
Maybe impossible to do.

24:58.663 --> 25:04.809
Well, some professors have said that they tried to work everything out, and they thought they had agreements and stuff, and she would back out.

25:05.030 --> 25:06.872
They wanted their students to use the collection.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.836
They had all kinds of things written out, which she had asked them to do.

25:11.609 --> 25:13.732
When it came down to it, she wouldn't let the kids in.

25:15.794 --> 25:16.956
It's a delightful story.

25:17.857 --> 25:18.919
I love it myself.

25:19.139 --> 25:19.880
I love the story.

25:20.340 --> 25:21.542
I'll tell you one story.

25:22.944 --> 25:29.372
I wonder if there's anyone else here at the university who could talk about, you know... Bringing it?

25:29.472 --> 25:30.253
Yeah.

25:30.273 --> 25:40.847
Well, the director of the library at that time was Gus Harrer, H-A-R-R-E-R, and he still has an office over in Library West.

25:40.947 --> 25:41.548
He's still here.

25:42.473 --> 25:47.180
So you can talk to him.

25:47.541 --> 25:48.422
Do you think he's here today?

25:48.502 --> 25:48.983
He may be.

25:49.023 --> 25:49.925
You can give him the call.

25:50.365 --> 25:51.026
I'm here.

25:51.046 --> 25:51.267
Yeah.

25:52.168 --> 25:53.009
Tell him what you're doing.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.692
This is serendipity, you know.

25:54.712 --> 25:54.993
Yeah.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.134
This book is very serendipity.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.478
One thing leads to another, yeah.

25:58.498 --> 25:59.379
But it's all over.

25:59.399 --> 26:02.685
If you want to know some of the things, please.

26:02.705 --> 26:03.886
Well, I'll give you another name.

26:04.127 --> 26:04.507
Go ahead.

26:04.527 --> 26:06.591
Justin Schiller, who's a book dealer near you, too.

26:06.611 --> 26:08.093
I was going to ask if Justin had anything.

26:08.377 --> 26:12.281
He evaluated her collection some years for tax purposes.

26:12.601 --> 26:14.823
And then S-C-H-I-L-L-E-R.

26:14.883 --> 26:15.144
Right.

26:17.246 --> 26:23.091
So that's another name who could give you a lot of insight into her character, her book collecting habits.

26:23.111 --> 26:27.355
I met him at one of the sales.

26:27.976 --> 26:32.380
Another one who might help is Milton Reisman.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.803
I think he's with the Victoria Bookshop.

26:34.923 --> 26:37.405
Or is that Justin?

26:38.600 --> 26:39.941
I'm not sure which it is.

26:39.961 --> 26:41.483
It's either Reisman or Reisman.

26:41.503 --> 26:44.727
It's R-E-I-S-S-M-A-N, probably.

26:44.747 --> 26:45.828
And he's in New York as well.

26:48.070 --> 26:51.033
I think his shop is Victoria.

26:51.053 --> 26:54.938
Did she ever do anything with Rostenberg and Stern, I wonder?

26:54.958 --> 26:56.079
That name isn't familiar to me.

26:56.099 --> 26:57.821
Leona Rostenberg and Mettle and Stern.

26:58.562 --> 26:59.883
They're both in their 80s.

26:59.903 --> 27:00.504
They're wonderful.

27:00.564 --> 27:01.345
I've interviewed them.

27:02.366 --> 27:04.988
And they do a lot of children's book stuff.

27:05.008 --> 27:05.369
I don't know.

27:05.389 --> 27:06.430
Their names aren't familiar.

27:06.629 --> 27:10.374
In fact, they've written several books.

27:11.375 --> 27:12.136
They're wonderful.

27:14.099 --> 27:16.201
And they don't describe any of this.

27:16.221 --> 27:19.325
Actually, we've got the interview, I would say.

27:19.345 --> 27:21.408
But very interesting to you.

27:22.309 --> 27:27.115
OK, anything else, please?

27:27.135 --> 27:29.378
I'll think of some stuff.

27:29.398 --> 27:34.645
I'm really hopeful that if you have anything like policy stuff, you mentioned that you had a written policy.

27:35.485 --> 27:37.307
Is that something I could get a copy of?

27:38.348 --> 27:39.910
Yeah.

27:40.210 --> 27:45.796
That's just a policy statement for when she got to the library, when she was using library funds, what it was that she was going to buy.

27:46.037 --> 27:56.108
She must have seen this as a great opportunity to continue building the collection with somebody else's funds.

27:57.169 --> 27:59.952
A lot of people would see this as, what an opportunity.

28:00.693 --> 28:04.917
Because apparently she didn't have any great family fortune.

28:04.957 --> 28:05.458
She didn't really

28:05.725 --> 28:09.869
She basically built this with a very modest budget.

28:09.889 --> 28:10.509
Is that correct?

28:10.529 --> 28:11.410
Right.

28:11.450 --> 28:13.952
Do you think she threw everything she had into this collection?

28:14.793 --> 28:24.282
A lot of her money went into this because she wasn't extravagant at all, and she had no even nieces and nephews to spend money on.

28:25.523 --> 28:31.048
But, you know, when she started buying, and even up through the mid-seventies, prices for children's books were rock bottom.

28:31.088 --> 28:33.610
I mean, I see prices in these books of 50 cents.

28:34.131 --> 28:35.732
She'd go into a bookstore

28:36.337 --> 28:39.241
And, of course, the children's books were often in a big room at the back.

28:39.301 --> 28:44.268
And she'd go in there and say, how much for this whole room of books?

28:45.189 --> 28:46.832
And the guy would be thrilled.

28:47.012 --> 28:47.653
You'd be thrilled.

28:47.913 --> 28:50.897
And she'd get 2,000 books for $1,000.

28:51.057 --> 28:52.099
Like that.

28:52.119 --> 28:53.821
And how would she move them?

28:53.841 --> 28:55.163
Boxes and a station wagon.

28:55.343 --> 28:57.126
She'd do it herself?

28:57.146 --> 28:58.848
What kind of car did she have?

28:58.868 --> 28:59.389
Do you know offhand?

28:59.409 --> 28:59.689
Buick.

28:59.709 --> 29:01.612
A big Buick station wagon, I think.

29:01.632 --> 29:01.872
Yeah.

29:02.834 --> 29:05.217
And was it old by the time you met her?

29:05.237 --> 29:05.297
No.

29:06.188 --> 29:12.255
I think she traded up every so often.

29:12.295 --> 29:15.860
Who could speak to the significance of the collection?

29:16.260 --> 29:19.364
Can you give me... Well, I think Bernie can to a certain extent.

29:20.786 --> 29:22.828
You mean a dollar value?

29:22.909 --> 29:23.750
No, no, no.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.712
A dollar doesn't interest me at all.

29:26.693 --> 29:27.454
The significance.

29:28.656 --> 29:32.280
Well, I've heard it said that it's the best

29:33.593 --> 29:38.699
collection of children's books, of British and American children's books, in one spot, bar none.

29:39.820 --> 29:51.353
That there are some libraries that are stronger in early American children's books, like the American Aquarian Society, or the Library of Congress is stronger in certain American children's books.

29:51.974 --> 29:57.960
The Bodleian is better in British children's books.

29:58.081 --> 30:02.065
Or some might have better illustrated books.

30:02.213 --> 30:08.919
The Osborne Collection in Toronto for the very, very early ones, I guess, pre-Victorian ones.

30:09.580 --> 30:15.285
The Morgan has, well, they've got this exhibit on now, which I saw last week.

30:15.305 --> 30:19.749
But yours, I guess, for everything else at one spot, is probably preeminent.

30:20.269 --> 30:30.398
And yet you're just now probably coming to realize what you have and how you can really use it and how you can use it to serve scholarship.

30:30.631 --> 30:32.133
because you really haven't been able to do that.

30:32.153 --> 30:32.534
That's right.

30:32.794 --> 30:35.598
You know, what my job is is to catalog.

30:35.638 --> 30:43.830
They've hired me to catalog the collection, because she had a catalog, but not according to quote-unquote standards.

30:44.991 --> 30:56.908
And in 1981, there was a book published of her catalog, but all the books purchased since 1981, the only record of them is downstairs in her card catalog.

30:57.209 --> 31:05.884
So what I'm doing is recataloging them according to national standards, assigning subject headings to them for access points, and putting them in the national database.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.289
So hopefully the use of it is going to start to increase.

31:09.970 --> 31:12.835
And also, we're saying now, this is a library.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.758
It's not a collection anymore.

31:15.560 --> 31:23.453
And we want it to be used, and we're willing to work with you to see what your needs are and how it can be used.

31:25.272 --> 31:27.054
It takes time, you know.

31:27.254 --> 31:27.915
Yeah, it'll take time.

31:27.935 --> 31:30.277
Everybody has to go through this, you know.

31:30.998 --> 31:33.360
I interviewed William Scheide.

31:33.381 --> 31:35.523
Have you ever heard of him from Princeton University?

31:36.824 --> 31:38.326
His library is there.

31:38.706 --> 31:40.368
You don't need this on tape.

31:40.388 --> 31:46.274
You know, you've had to wait to get this, to have this collection become a library.

31:46.334 --> 31:48.296
That's a very interesting way to put that.

31:49.137 --> 31:50.679
But would you say it's been worth the wait?

31:51.439 --> 31:52.200
Definitely, yeah.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.823
And now, is your background in children's literature?

31:55.259 --> 31:59.004
Well, my background is some children's literature.

31:59.024 --> 32:03.070
I have a master's in library science, and I've got my bachelor's in English.

32:04.932 --> 32:05.713
And I'm looking.

32:06.074 --> 32:07.235
Are you Floridian?

32:07.516 --> 32:09.078
No, I'm Michigan, personally.

32:09.098 --> 32:10.380
I graduated from Ann Arbor.

32:10.400 --> 32:10.700
Really?

32:10.780 --> 32:13.364
Well, I'm going out there next month to the Clements Library.

32:13.384 --> 32:14.225
Yeah, when you mentioned that.

32:14.245 --> 32:17.169
Have you ever heard of Toby Holtzman in Grosse Pointe?

32:19.152 --> 32:20.854
I'm glad this guy's unbelievable.

32:20.874 --> 32:22.937
That was a long time ago when I graduated.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.662
Okay, go ahead.

32:25.682 --> 32:25.962
I'm sorry.

32:25.982 --> 32:31.448
But I'm thinking of doing some more work, master's work in the children's.

32:31.628 --> 32:32.349
I don't know.

32:34.071 --> 32:39.176
I'd like a real cultural interdisciplinary approach because this collection's strengths aren't literary.

32:39.496 --> 32:41.058
They're cultural and social.

32:45.282 --> 32:51.709
A lot of what she collected is everyone has forgotten the author and the title, but a lot of the values

32:52.600 --> 32:57.384
that society held dear to their heart are hidden in that fiction.

32:59.186 --> 33:16.060
And it's going to be the anthropologists and the sociologists, and I think a very interdisciplinary group of scholars is going to be interested in using this, including illustrators and artists, people who are interested in book bindings.

33:16.160 --> 33:22.405
I mean, there's just really a fantastic array of

33:23.650 --> 33:28.875
of publishing processes, printing processes and things like that, as well as literary.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.357
Do you think she was mindful?

33:30.457 --> 33:33.280
Was she a scholar when it came to these things?

33:33.500 --> 33:34.361
I would say not.

33:34.701 --> 33:35.402
She was collecting.

33:35.742 --> 33:35.863
Right.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.185
She must have had some idea of what she was assembling.

33:38.265 --> 33:38.886
She did, yeah.

33:38.906 --> 33:42.429
And is leaving it to the next generation of it to figure out what it is.

33:42.730 --> 33:42.850
Yeah.

33:43.190 --> 33:46.173
Did she ever articulate the way you just did what she had?

33:46.213 --> 33:48.055
Or is this your read on it?

33:48.315 --> 33:50.097
This is pretty much my read on it.

33:50.398 --> 33:50.798
Yeah.

33:51.739 --> 33:52.780
That's pretty interesting.

33:53.924 --> 34:06.260
Well, what's interesting to me is the cataloger, because I've got to figure out... When I look at a book and try to figure out who in the world is ever going to want to read this book and why, in other words, how would this book be useful to some scholar?

34:06.781 --> 34:18.837
It's definitely not literary style, it's not the author, and it's not the title, which are sort of the traditional ways that literary people make uses of books.

34:18.857 --> 34:22.902
But it's the way this book of fiction shows...

34:23.135 --> 34:37.108
the attitudes towards young girls or what they were expected to do or relationships between daughters and fathers or, you know, so it's those kinds of more social and cultural things, I think, that are really very fascinating.

34:37.148 --> 34:37.989
And, of course, the religious.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.571
She has a lot of religious chapbooks and tract societies.

34:42.113 --> 34:43.274
Did she ever talk about her father?

34:44.955 --> 34:45.316
Yes.

34:47.077 --> 34:49.800
I mean, Brittany had mentioned to me

34:50.287 --> 35:01.657
It was almost Freudian, I mean, that he was this collector of Shakespeareana, and who apparently considered himself, apparently, you know, superior, right?

35:02.538 --> 35:03.959
Yeah, I would say that's the impression I got.

35:04.019 --> 35:08.343
And that maybe what she was doing was, all right, I'll show you.

35:10.265 --> 35:19.973
And Bernie said, and I'm quoting him now, and this is why I'm using his name, because he said it before, that the irony is his collection is in all likelihood dispersed,

35:20.358 --> 35:35.420
because he really didn't have any primary things, and yet the daughter's collection is the one which is now enshrined, so to speak, in a major repository and will bear her name, you know, indefinitely, along those in the libraries.

35:36.481 --> 35:38.764
A kind of ironic twist, isn't it?

35:39.886 --> 35:43.671
Well, you know, his little comment, too, that this would be a good thing for a woman to collect.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.816
Well, my cookbooks, you know, my cookery books.

35:46.896 --> 35:49.099
Elizabeth Pennell collected cookery books.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.183
Except that she carried it one step further.

35:52.263 --> 35:54.065
Her collection was destroyed by water.

35:54.926 --> 36:00.412
Joseph Pinnell's wife, the illustrator, had a magnificent collection of cookbooks.

36:01.473 --> 36:07.960
But that's the kind of thing, oh, you can collect sewing books or gardening books or something like that.

36:07.980 --> 36:09.903
And she probably said, I'll show you.

36:10.784 --> 36:11.164
Who knows?

36:11.284 --> 36:13.987
But did she ever say anything like that, I guess is what I'm driving at.

36:15.509 --> 36:19.153
I don't remember her saying anything like that regarding the collection itself.

36:20.973 --> 36:22.935
But the achievement, what she was doing.

36:23.355 --> 36:23.535
Yeah.

36:24.396 --> 36:25.077
What drove her?

36:25.137 --> 36:26.678
I want to know what drove her.

36:27.238 --> 36:32.783
Well, you know, now that I think about it, it could be a competitiveness with her father.

36:33.904 --> 36:37.507
I mean, there's a lot here that makes it more than circumstantial.

36:37.548 --> 36:40.670
I mean, the sisters, what they did with their lives.

36:41.871 --> 36:49.438
I mean, you don't have to have a PhD from Harvard Medical School to see interesting little things here, you know?

36:50.539 --> 36:50.659
Yeah.

36:51.213 --> 36:59.021
Well, she did tell me once that her father managed to run off any man that was brave enough to darken their front doorway.

37:01.003 --> 37:04.946
Did she say that with a smile or with anger, I wonder?

37:07.469 --> 37:09.291
Well, I don't think she was angry anymore.

37:09.311 --> 37:13.375
Because she was 72 at this point.

37:13.395 --> 37:13.615
Right.

37:16.338 --> 37:20.882
I think she revered her father, but she was also, I sense, sort of bitter.

37:22.718 --> 37:29.345
I'm wondering if there's kind of an Emily Dickinson kind of a thing here, or the Austin sisters, you know?

37:29.646 --> 37:33.951
I don't know.

37:33.971 --> 37:40.098
Now, this other sister is really a cousin who was adopted.

37:40.818 --> 37:41.619
The one out in?

37:41.920 --> 37:42.340
Illinois.

37:43.061 --> 37:43.782
She's a sister.

37:44.122 --> 37:45.764
Yeah, essentially she's a sister.

37:45.804 --> 37:49.468
She was brought up in the same home.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.575
It'll be interesting to talk to her.

37:51.695 --> 37:52.236
Oh, I will.

37:53.578 --> 37:57.044
You can count on that.

37:57.064 --> 38:00.690
Where else can you tell me, do you think?

38:00.710 --> 38:04.977
Well, I think... Now, this fellow Gus, would I just walk over there?

38:05.478 --> 38:06.099
I would call.

38:06.460 --> 38:08.844
We can use my phone and see if he's in.

38:08.884 --> 38:12.289
Do we take regular lunch hours here?

38:12.309 --> 38:14.393
Well, he may be in or he may be out.

38:14.453 --> 38:16.857
I don't know how much, really, he's around.

38:17.309 --> 38:18.731
She could even talk to him by phone.

38:18.851 --> 38:20.793
Yeah, he maybe could call in.

38:20.873 --> 38:22.015
If you could just give me his number.

38:27.742 --> 38:31.587
While you're doing that, are there any unique items here, so far as you know?

38:34.150 --> 38:34.891
I don't know of any.

38:35.672 --> 38:40.077
I have, well, I don't know that there are any that are unique and highly valuable.

38:41.018 --> 38:42.540
I'm sure there are many that are unique.

38:43.921 --> 38:46.964
And by that, I mean one of a kind, no other known or recorded kind.

38:46.984 --> 38:48.786
Oh, I would guess we've got a lot of those.

38:48.987 --> 39:01.060
But a lot of them would be those late 19th century novels that no one cared about collecting.

39:01.981 --> 39:04.464
And maybe nobody still cares about collecting.

39:05.205 --> 39:07.107
But they belong in a collection someplace.

39:08.669 --> 39:11.532
Now, as far as really valuable, rare things,

39:14.549 --> 39:15.050
I don't know.

39:16.372 --> 39:18.715
So that's mainly because I don't know enough about rare books.

39:20.017 --> 39:22.561
And who here, in addition to Mr. Haller?

39:22.581 --> 39:24.163
Is it Mr. Haller or Dr. Haller?

39:24.283 --> 39:25.204
H-A-R-R-E.

39:25.725 --> 39:26.386
H-A-R-R-E.

39:26.566 --> 39:27.368
H-A-R-R.

39:29.350 --> 39:35.259
Maybe I can call him.

39:35.499 --> 39:35.840
Yeah.

39:35.860 --> 39:40.226
It shouldn't take more than half an hour to show me around, should it, the stuff downstairs?

39:40.326 --> 39:41.207
No, I can show you.

39:42.249 --> 39:42.970
Not much time.

39:44.114 --> 39:48.781
Harry's books from the 20th century.

39:48.801 --> 39:52.987
The Bobsy twins.

39:53.387 --> 39:55.570
Bobbsy is B-O-B-B-S-E-Y, right?

39:55.851 --> 39:56.712
I think so.

39:56.732 --> 39:59.196
We can look out there.

39:59.216 --> 40:01.239
Bob Dexter and the clubhouse mystery.

40:01.259 --> 40:03.001
The boy ranchers among the Indians.

40:03.041 --> 40:06.426
The boy ranchers in the camp, et cetera, et cetera.

40:06.777 --> 40:16.635
These are a lot of boys and girls series, Hardy Boys, Cherry Amens, all kinds of things like that.

40:16.655 --> 40:18.037
They're pretty nice additions, aren't they?

40:18.117 --> 40:19.259
Pretty nice copies.

40:19.660 --> 40:20.502
Yeah.

40:20.522 --> 40:23.186
Let me just take a shot here, if it's all right with you.

40:23.267 --> 40:23.487
Yeah.

40:47.952 --> 40:59.228
This is a family library put out by Harper and Brothers.

41:00.089 --> 41:01.511
Those are mainly bound tracks.

41:02.933 --> 41:03.594
Look at them.

41:03.614 --> 41:08.621
I wonder if she cut those as collections or just... Have you put these together or did she put these together?

41:08.641 --> 41:09.903
She had these together here like this.

41:11.766 --> 41:12.627
Okay, let's move on.

41:16.302 --> 41:18.485
Did the university build this room for her?

41:18.585 --> 41:19.306
No, it was here.

41:20.007 --> 41:22.430
In fact, she had been promised another place.

41:22.490 --> 41:28.437
This is not an ideal location, although the setting is very nice, but there's too much light and temperature fluctuation.

41:28.457 --> 41:30.499
There is indeed.

41:30.519 --> 41:30.920
Yeah.

41:30.940 --> 41:34.664
All around up here are 19th century books, hardback books.

41:35.465 --> 41:38.930
I'm just writing right away.

41:44.056 --> 41:44.376
It's fine.

41:45.438 --> 41:45.718
And...

41:46.627 --> 41:54.615
The books in the boxes over there is her Welch collection, which are books from the bibliography of D.A.

41:54.695 --> 42:01.562
Welch, who wrote the definitive book on pre-1820's children's books.

42:01.582 --> 42:03.324
And she has a really nice collection of them.

42:04.084 --> 42:07.087
And these are all books, hardback books under five inches.

42:08.429 --> 42:09.970
Oh.

42:15.616 --> 42:15.756
Oh.

42:16.327 --> 42:21.392
Look at that.

42:21.412 --> 42:25.736
It's full of them, full of these tiny bits.

42:25.756 --> 42:27.077
This looks like a card catalog.

42:27.097 --> 42:27.718
It is, yeah.

42:28.518 --> 42:29.820
But it's actually books.

42:29.840 --> 42:30.100
Right.

42:32.202 --> 42:33.323
Isn't that spectacular?

42:33.923 --> 42:37.407
Oh, I've got to get another picture of that.

42:37.427 --> 42:38.968
That's the Lilliput Library.

42:39.248 --> 42:40.549
Wait, let me get the keys out.

42:40.569 --> 42:43.352
You know what they call it?

42:43.372 --> 42:44.393
Lilliput Library.

42:44.913 --> 42:58.096
I really get a kick on these things.

42:58.196 --> 43:02.363
Oh, wait, let me show you the Welsh collection first.

43:02.383 --> 43:05.048
These are for pre-1820 American interest.

43:09.854 --> 43:15.579
Any time anyone refers to the Welch collection, people know what those are.

43:15.599 --> 43:18.221
You've got to do something about the sunlight here, though.

43:18.241 --> 43:18.361
Right.

43:18.962 --> 43:19.462
You know that.

43:20.103 --> 43:21.444
Yeah.

43:21.464 --> 43:28.050
See, these are all books from 1820 and before.

43:28.090 --> 43:28.870
It's unbelievable.

43:30.151 --> 43:32.734
So we've got 12 boxes below.

43:32.814 --> 43:38.899
I would just want to write down a few scattered titles, but you probably must have something on that to indicate.

43:39.284 --> 43:40.105
Some of the titles.

43:42.328 --> 43:42.689
On what?

43:42.969 --> 43:43.450
On anything.

43:43.470 --> 43:45.052
Titles from the collection.

43:45.693 --> 43:47.055
Oh, yeah, we can get that.

43:47.115 --> 43:48.137
Get me, yeah, yeah.

43:48.197 --> 43:49.679
We don't have to take notes on that now.

43:50.040 --> 43:50.621
Okay, yeah.

43:52.724 --> 43:58.111
Just for detail purposes, you know.

43:58.131 --> 44:02.999
Well, she has some authors that are really fairly rare, too.

44:03.019 --> 44:04.701
She has a lot of Jacob Abbott.

44:05.153 --> 44:08.878
There's a lot of Molesworth as a writer in the early part of the 1800s.

44:10.119 --> 44:14.866
In fact, when we're done, if it's hard with you, maybe I can just walk through and take some notes.

44:15.026 --> 44:15.587
Can I do that?

44:16.688 --> 44:17.009
Yeah.

44:17.089 --> 44:17.289
No?

44:17.469 --> 44:17.870
Yes.

44:18.611 --> 44:19.071
That's fine.

44:20.473 --> 44:21.775
As soon as I finish shooting these pictures.

44:21.795 --> 44:23.056
Okay, these are really the oldest books.

44:23.777 --> 44:23.978
Okay.

44:24.158 --> 44:26.581
These are supposedly, most of these are before 1820.

44:26.621 --> 44:29.024
This is a beautiful room.

44:29.044 --> 44:31.888
These are various editions of Pilgrim's Progress.

44:32.389 --> 44:32.549
Yeah.

44:32.769 --> 44:34.992
Those are various editions of Aesop's Fables.

44:35.107 --> 44:42.194
And these are all different editions of drones from Crusoe.

44:42.254 --> 44:43.175
Whose desk is this?

44:43.416 --> 44:44.076
That's Bernie's.

44:44.096 --> 44:44.757
That's from Bernie's.

44:52.245 --> 44:56.990
He's quite a catch for you, I have to say, coming in from... Yeah, we're real happy with him.

44:58.592 --> 44:58.712
Yeah.

44:58.752 --> 44:59.933
That's our good picture.

45:03.288 --> 45:10.863
It's asking to take pictures of them all along, so why not, right?

45:10.883 --> 45:13.348
Now, she not only collected hardback, but also paperbacks.

45:13.528 --> 45:18.157
These drawers are full of paperback books from the 1800s.

45:18.658 --> 45:20.462
Many of those will be unique, by the way.

45:20.963 --> 45:21.784
Oh, I would think so.

45:21.864 --> 45:23.648
I can't imagine that anywhere else would have to be.

45:23.668 --> 45:25.752
These will be your unique items.

45:33.359 --> 45:36.924
Yeah, that's what I meant when I said we don't have unique and rare things.

45:36.964 --> 45:38.065
These are all full of that.

45:38.987 --> 45:42.872
You just don't know yet, and that's what the scholar's job is to determine.

45:43.072 --> 45:46.617
This is her partial collection of cat books.

45:47.458 --> 45:47.598
Oh.

45:48.239 --> 45:49.261
And Tom's on Bible.

45:49.861 --> 45:50.162
Yeah.

45:50.743 --> 45:52.164
Now, I don't know about a picture of this.

45:52.665 --> 45:52.845
Why?

45:53.326 --> 45:56.070
You don't think this would give ideas to anybody like Stephen, do you?

45:56.470 --> 45:57.472
Only if we can get in here.

45:58.753 --> 45:59.615
Stephen's in jail.

46:01.737 --> 46:02.218
I'm not...

46:04.595 --> 46:06.178
This is, for me, as much as anything.

46:09.182 --> 46:10.585
You know, I have to give a floor plan.

46:10.665 --> 46:13.249
You know what I'm saying?

46:13.690 --> 46:18.958
I need to give five of collectors who have these anxieties back on.

46:18.978 --> 46:21.803
Okay, these are more paperbacks from the 19th century.

46:22.864 --> 46:23.946
She has this whole metal cabinet.

46:24.046 --> 46:26.390
The chapbooks, I gather, are really valuable.

46:26.610 --> 46:29.295
Shall we say rare?

46:29.395 --> 46:30.296
Just use the word.

46:30.637 --> 46:31.378
Rare, sphere.

46:32.708 --> 46:33.749
I would guess, yeah.

46:33.769 --> 46:37.693
Because that concerned you more than any of the others for some reason.

46:38.354 --> 46:40.156
Well, I can't really make those judgments.

46:40.176 --> 46:40.656
I don't know.

46:40.756 --> 46:44.900
But I don't really know what's most valuable.

46:45.801 --> 46:46.802
That's irrelevant to me.

46:47.863 --> 46:49.645
It's the totality of the collection.

46:49.785 --> 46:52.308
I'm going to get a picture of this.

46:52.328 --> 46:54.070
This will shoot very well.

46:54.090 --> 47:01.918
Take it back a little bit.

47:01.938 --> 47:02.378
It's very interesting.

47:12.854 --> 47:14.216
Get the light out before we go.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.664
OK, I've shot about as much as I'm going to.

47:19.804 --> 47:24.571
What I'd like to do, if possible, is just spend 10 or 15 minutes.

47:24.592 --> 47:27.155
So you think she has another room with collections of what?

47:27.496 --> 47:37.551
She has a collection of golden books, probably 500 of them in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, which no library kept or collected.

47:37.671 --> 47:40.175
And certainly parents threw them out at the first opportunity.

47:40.315 --> 47:42.338
So I have a feeling that's unique, really.

47:42.723 --> 47:44.625
and nobody collected them.

47:44.645 --> 47:47.728
As far as I know... Maybe we can look at them.

47:48.048 --> 47:49.529
You said she guided the door, huh?

47:51.711 --> 47:56.255
You know, she didn't spend a lot of time looking at that.

47:56.395 --> 48:02.741
She had a door that had an alarm on it that every time it opened it emitted this high-pitched scream.

48:03.702 --> 48:06.985
And it pretty much stayed on there.

48:07.005 --> 48:08.767
There was no other access to it.

48:08.787 --> 48:10.148
Was there anybody else in here?

48:10.448 --> 48:12.010
Well, yeah, she's had an assistant.

48:12.250 --> 48:15.213
She has someone for five years before me, and then I went here.

48:15.673 --> 48:16.795
Is the assistant still around?

48:17.715 --> 48:18.897
Yeah, actually, she is.

48:19.037 --> 48:19.978
I don't know her very well.

48:19.998 --> 48:20.799
She's retired.

48:21.299 --> 48:26.344
Her name is Catherine Dunlap, and I don't know really anything more about her.

48:27.746 --> 48:30.669
Can I just leave this here, please?

48:30.689 --> 48:31.269
This camera?

48:31.289 --> 48:32.551
I'll leave it with Melissa.

48:32.991 --> 48:33.211
Okay.

48:33.231 --> 48:34.853
She may not be around.

48:34.873 --> 48:35.474
That's all right.

48:35.494 --> 48:36.054
We'll carry it.

48:36.175 --> 48:36.675
It's just that I'm...

48:39.355 --> 48:53.151
I also knew her fairly well and dealt with her really much longer than I have or Bernie has.

48:53.491 --> 48:54.352
And who is he?

48:54.372 --> 48:57.996
He's the assistant director of libraries for special collections.

48:58.777 --> 49:01.700
I'll talk to him.

49:01.800 --> 49:04.584
Yeah, he's just under the director as far as levels go.

49:04.604 --> 49:04.924
Okay.

49:05.765 --> 49:07.408
And who's the director?

49:07.748 --> 49:08.610
Dale Kanellis.

49:08.890 --> 49:09.431
It's a woman.

49:10.653 --> 49:11.414
C-K?

49:11.494 --> 49:13.417
C-A-N-E-L-A-F.

49:13.437 --> 49:14.098
That's a Greek name.

49:14.218 --> 49:14.579
I'm Greek.

49:16.161 --> 49:20.849
I know Greek names when I hear them.

49:20.869 --> 49:22.512
These are 20th century books.

49:22.532 --> 49:25.316
This is rather extensive, no question about it.

49:25.336 --> 49:26.879
Oh, it is.

49:26.899 --> 49:27.840
I mean, it's enormous.

49:28.816 --> 49:30.558
These are encyclopedias and things.

49:30.738 --> 49:31.680
These are landmark books.

49:31.700 --> 49:33.302
Did you read landmark books when you were a kid?

49:33.402 --> 49:33.542
Mm-hmm.

49:33.562 --> 49:35.745
All that kind of stuff.

49:35.765 --> 49:36.686
This is an archives.

49:36.706 --> 49:37.667
Here's a collection of golden books.

49:37.687 --> 49:38.288
Oh, look at that.

49:38.328 --> 49:39.429
Yeah, I've got to get a picture of that.

49:39.750 --> 49:40.531
Let me just put that.

49:41.592 --> 49:41.872
Good.

49:41.892 --> 49:42.794
You can keep talking.

49:42.974 --> 49:44.556
You can hold this if you'd like.

49:45.938 --> 49:47.399
All right.

49:47.419 --> 49:47.980
Put that up there.

49:49.001 --> 49:49.742
That's great.

49:49.762 --> 49:51.264
Could you maybe just take one out?

49:53.066 --> 49:53.507
I'm going to try.

49:54.061 --> 49:59.767
When you talk about unique things in the library, this is probably one of the most unique things we have.

49:59.787 --> 50:00.648
The Golden Books.

50:00.989 --> 50:08.477
And again, value-wise, individually, it's going to be like an old Life magazine, probably.

50:09.058 --> 50:16.206
Taken as a collection, you have what is a unique archive.

50:17.527 --> 50:18.789
What were the years on Golden Books?

50:18.849 --> 50:21.652
Maybe I could get that from Random House, I guess.

50:21.952 --> 50:22.633
Yeah, you could.

50:23.356 --> 50:24.918
Why don't we just pull one out at random?

50:24.978 --> 50:27.802
Yeah, I don't know if they were out in the 30s or not.

50:27.822 --> 50:28.964
Five Little Firemen.

50:33.550 --> 50:34.352
This is 48.

50:34.512 --> 50:38.397
I would think... What does it say on the title page?

50:38.417 --> 50:39.399
Yeah, the copyright page.

50:39.419 --> 50:41.261
Let's just see what it says on the copyright page.

50:42.063 --> 50:43.384
It's called A Little Golden Look.

50:44.546 --> 50:45.247
Simon Schuster.

50:48.311 --> 50:49.213
It's that random house.

50:51.596 --> 50:52.317
Looks like a couple others.

50:54.271 --> 50:56.534
Maybe Random House has a later one.

50:57.436 --> 50:58.838
A Little Golden Book.

50:58.858 --> 50:59.979
Oh, no, these, let's see.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.605
Oh, yeah, Western Publishing Company.

51:03.625 --> 51:04.987
Little Golden Book, okay.

51:05.027 --> 51:05.488
Western.

51:06.769 --> 51:09.594
Yeah, somewhere in Wisconsin, Racine, Wisconsin.

51:09.654 --> 51:15.923
Now, it seems to me that it's part of a... Oh, I'll find out.

51:16.083 --> 51:18.487
Okay, yeah.

51:18.507 --> 51:19.568
I don't think it's Random House.

51:20.329 --> 51:22.673
Okay, it could be.

51:22.773 --> 51:24.075
That's very easily...

51:24.427 --> 51:25.889
How many would you say there are?

51:25.929 --> 51:29.895
Well, I've 506 in my mind for some reason, but I'm not sure.

51:31.256 --> 51:32.538
We could do a quick count here.

51:32.979 --> 51:35.442
Look at how many there are on each shelf and multiply.

51:35.542 --> 51:36.564
Yeah, this is Simon & Schuster.

51:36.584 --> 51:40.649
It must have been... This is 46.

51:43.433 --> 51:44.094
That's no sweat.

51:44.194 --> 51:47.038
I can figure this out.

51:47.118 --> 51:49.101
How many rooms altogether?

51:49.300 --> 51:50.001
How's her books?

51:50.201 --> 51:50.962
Okay.

51:50.982 --> 51:52.764
One, two, three, four.

51:52.924 --> 51:54.465
Four plus that balcony area.

51:55.306 --> 51:58.670
Which is very... What was that prior to becoming her... that room?

51:58.690 --> 52:02.134
Was that just... Well, it was the rare books room for a while.

52:02.734 --> 52:10.723
And longer ago was an area where students could browse books and read.

52:10.883 --> 52:11.884
And her office was where?

52:11.904 --> 52:13.165
Right around where Melissa's is?

52:13.185 --> 52:14.467
Yeah, where Melissa was sitting.

52:14.547 --> 52:15.528
That was her office.

52:15.568 --> 52:18.191
So she basically did guide the door.

52:18.331 --> 52:18.531
Right.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.322
That's great.

52:21.904 --> 52:23.466
Question, are you still adding to the collection?

52:23.746 --> 52:25.228
Yes, we're still purchasing.

52:27.491 --> 52:28.772
We're not sure what direction.

52:28.792 --> 52:30.174
At this point, it's more of the same.

52:30.955 --> 52:35.461
But we may do more collecting in or purchasing in more recent books.

52:35.541 --> 52:40.948
We may try to increase our holdings from 1950 on because we really are very poor in 1950 on.

52:41.148 --> 52:48.197
You see, this is an opportunity for the university now using this as a beginning to really secure dominance in a

52:48.582 --> 52:52.447
Okay, I've seen it.

52:55.070 --> 52:56.432
You said she collected a lot of other things?

52:56.452 --> 52:57.894
A lot of other things.

52:57.914 --> 53:04.642
Rocks, shells, postcards, stamps, and figurines of children reading, which I can show you.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.484
I'd love to see some of them.

53:06.765 --> 53:07.886
What happened to all those things?

53:08.727 --> 53:16.497
Well, I think she was in the process of disposing of rocks, shells, stamps, and her sister may be able to tell you what happened to more of them.

53:17.168 --> 53:18.389
The figurines are still here.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.510
I'd like to see some of them.

53:21.071 --> 53:29.038
One of the wonderful things about cataloging this collection is I get to read all the inscriptions in all the books, and because she picked books that children read there, almost every book has something written in it.

53:29.739 --> 53:40.088
For example, here it says, We all think this book exceedingly good, the true story of a child's life, telling, or rather expressing, good thoughts which show the writer must know something about a child's heart.

53:42.169 --> 53:43.110
And who wrote that, I wonder?

53:44.091 --> 53:44.792
Yours truly.

53:44.832 --> 53:45.812
The book or this little thing?

53:45.833 --> 53:46.433
That little thing.

53:47.729 --> 53:48.670
Well, it's fine.

53:48.690 --> 53:49.532
Miss S.P.

53:50.934 --> 53:52.076
Sang, it looks like.

53:52.096 --> 53:52.957
So it's probably her book.

53:52.977 --> 53:55.661
And notice it's got a cracked spine.

53:55.681 --> 53:56.001
Right.

53:57.564 --> 53:58.545
Looks like it had been read.

53:58.565 --> 53:59.827
Warren, Doris.

54:00.328 --> 54:04.735
This was to Doris Knox from Mama in the summer, 1896.

54:04.955 --> 54:06.177
That's wonderful.

54:07.038 --> 54:09.001
Get that down, Annette.

54:09.021 --> 54:10.604
Stuck it.

54:10.624 --> 54:11.885
Stories children love.

54:11.926 --> 54:12.927
Yeah, that's...

54:13.632 --> 54:14.593
You see, that's wonderful.

54:14.833 --> 54:15.274
That is.

54:15.374 --> 54:15.674
Yeah.

54:15.894 --> 54:16.715
I mean, I've handled it.

54:16.735 --> 54:18.256
What a wonderful book just pulled out.

54:18.276 --> 54:19.478
Yeah, just like that.

54:19.718 --> 54:20.058
Yeah.

54:20.178 --> 54:21.420
Did you expect that just now?

54:22.501 --> 54:25.984
Well, many books have little unexpected changes like this.

54:27.105 --> 54:31.349
Do you remember many of them, or are they just kind of pleasing as you go along?

54:32.530 --> 54:33.291
Warming, I guess.

54:33.311 --> 54:34.192
Yeah, that's what it is.

54:34.252 --> 54:40.538
It makes you realize that little tiny human hands actually probably actually read this book or opened it under a tree.

54:40.598 --> 54:41.379
Let's find another one.

54:41.799 --> 54:42.660
Can you think of another one?

54:42.978 --> 54:47.563
Um, well, I don't know.

54:47.583 --> 54:48.004
We can pick a couple.

54:48.024 --> 54:53.130
You've got me on a tangent here, which I like.

54:54.111 --> 54:55.072
Let's see what the golden secret has.

54:55.092 --> 54:56.133
Well, this is an award book.

54:56.974 --> 55:02.661
This is another thing that they were often done, is they were given to students for being first in math or first in geography.

55:03.001 --> 55:06.846
I even found one that was awarded to a student for being first in knitting.

55:06.866 --> 55:11.972
This is July 25, 1874, the Windsor Lodge Award.

55:12.425 --> 55:35.968
the winter lodge academy portobello first prize awarded to miss joan b jane miss jane b-r-i-t-c-h-i-e-s for music junior class second division john ruskin's stuff here exactly young kids

55:38.328 --> 55:40.031
They almost all have at least an inscription.

55:40.291 --> 55:40.452
Yeah.

55:40.752 --> 55:49.046
Raymond Robbins, R-O-B-I-N-S, from Miss Garside, G-A-R-S-I-D-E, Christmas 1880.

55:49.527 --> 55:50.889
So that must be from a teacher?

55:51.190 --> 55:51.731
Yeah, you'd think so.

55:51.811 --> 55:54.195
That's what it sounds like, yeah.

55:54.215 --> 55:56.238
Santa Claus, his friend St.

55:56.258 --> 55:56.519
Nicholas.

55:56.539 --> 55:57.320
This is pretty nice.

55:58.081 --> 56:00.085
I'm going to write that down.

56:00.666 --> 56:03.711
I found one series of books by a male author.

56:04.197 --> 56:08.243
And the inscription each year had been from an aunt and uncle to this boy.

56:08.924 --> 56:12.469
And every Christmas, apparently, they had gotten him one of this author's books.

56:12.489 --> 56:13.851
That was their Christmas gift.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.573
Do you remember the author?

56:18.097 --> 56:19.118
It might have been Castleman.

56:19.900 --> 56:21.342
How do you spell it?

56:22.123 --> 56:24.787
C-A-S-T-L-E-M-O-N.

56:29.193 --> 56:29.293
Okay.
