WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:03.694
Okay.

00:03.714 --> 00:04.655
And we're rolling.

00:04.795 --> 00:04.895
Good.

00:05.616 --> 00:07.918
So we're talking to Dr. John Ittelson.

00:07.958 --> 00:09.220
Is that how you pronounce your name, sir?

00:09.240 --> 00:10.061
That's correct.

00:10.201 --> 00:12.423
It's I-T-T-E-L-S-O-N.

00:12.543 --> 00:13.524
Okay.

00:13.544 --> 00:17.188
I think I explained to you yesterday briefly what I'm working on.

00:17.909 --> 00:27.760
And of particular, of course, it's funny when you just called, I was working on the prologue for this new book, which really shows how confident I am that I think I've got to

00:27.740 --> 00:51.435
I've got an idea of where I'm going with it, but I'm really interested in a continuum of books and libraries and book people, hoping to, planning to have some chapters that suggest and document libraries through history, book people through history, book culture.

00:52.748 --> 01:06.640
And what's very, very interesting to me is not only books in national libraries and public libraries and institutional libraries, but also you have these rare instances

01:07.261 --> 01:21.145
where you have a brand new university just formed within the last four or five years, where it doesn't have a tradition like Harvard that goes back 370 years of maintaining a library.

01:21.506 --> 01:22.047
What do you do?

01:22.728 --> 01:23.810
How do you go about this?

01:23.990 --> 01:25.573
And I think you're kind of in a...

01:25.553 --> 01:41.487
Quite an unusual situation, and you could probably give me some pretty good insights on your experience out there, the philosophy that you have, the importance of the library, not just the library, but also the technological materials that you clearly have.

01:41.467 --> 01:46.194
determined are very important to your mission, then I guess that's where I want to say that.

01:46.214 --> 01:47.476
That's kind of a general opening.

01:47.536 --> 01:52.082
Maybe if we could just tick-tock a little bit, we could focus in on a few questions.

01:52.142 --> 01:56.969
Let me just do a couple hits on it, and you can tell me when we're getting warm.

01:57.270 --> 01:58.351
Good.

01:58.732 --> 02:09.428
One, on the library, because we talked about that a little bit the last time when there were some press releases, I think, that talked about that our library wasn't going to have books, so it was going to be all electronic.

02:09.708 --> 02:11.170
Right.

02:11.875 --> 02:16.162
The campus, as I did mention, was sort of a campus of opportunity.

02:16.302 --> 02:25.377
The Fort Ord base closed, and although it wasn't planned, it wasn't in the state's master plan to have a campus here.

02:26.399 --> 02:32.128
They were trying to find out what was the appropriate use for the base and the idea of turning it into a...

02:32.800 --> 02:35.964
or a portion of it, we have less than 4% of the old base.

02:36.484 --> 02:36.885
Is that right?

02:37.225 --> 02:38.006
Yeah.

02:38.146 --> 02:45.695
The base is 46 square miles from San Francisco, and we have 1,365 acres, just under 4%.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.076
1,065?

02:47.116 --> 02:47.797
1,365.

02:47.817 --> 02:49.659
365.

02:49.980 --> 02:50.280
Yeah.

02:50.340 --> 02:54.725
So what's happening to the rest of the stuff, just out of curiosity?

02:55.706 --> 03:00.732
The rest of the stuff, there's 4,000 acres in the Bureau of Land Management.

03:01.488 --> 03:11.092
there's another plot of land which is about the size of our campus that is designated as a research incubator by the UC system.

03:12.295 --> 03:13.818
Have you ever been to Monterey?

03:13.899 --> 03:15.062
I have several times.

03:15.082 --> 03:17.708
So if you drive along Highway 1 on the

03:18.059 --> 03:22.827
West side of the highway, you would see sand dunes that had target practice.

03:22.847 --> 03:23.628
I remember it.

03:23.648 --> 03:27.354
I was a naval officer out that way in the late 60s.

03:27.654 --> 03:38.051
Well, where the rifle training was, they've just done a toxic cleanup of the lead, sort of getting the lead out, as it were.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.137
And that's going to be eventually turned over as a state park.

03:42.157 --> 03:42.438
Really?

03:42.898 --> 03:45.282
So then part of the...

03:45.953 --> 03:55.257
The land will be given over to the city of Marina, which is on one side of the base, part of the land given over to the city of Seaside.

03:55.839 --> 03:59.288
And then some of the land will be designated for...

03:59.960 --> 04:00.822
private use.

04:00.862 --> 04:06.654
They're talking about building another golf course.

04:06.894 --> 04:13.809
So the base is part of a reuse of the four-door.

04:17.597 --> 04:20.162
What do you do with military bases when you don't need them?

04:21.357 --> 04:34.260
But in doing that, the campus, since it wasn't even in the long-term master plan of the state system, there was a lot of thought going through, well, what should this campus be or become?

04:35.121 --> 04:38.387
And it happened to turn out that we're the 21st campus.

04:38.958 --> 04:44.748
in the CSU system, and we're coming along to 21st century, so I'm getting millennium out.

04:45.509 --> 04:54.303
But one of our phrases was, you know, the 21st campus of the CSU system to prepare our students for the 21st century.

04:54.323 --> 04:55.465
Can I just interject?

04:55.485 --> 05:03.919
The CSU system, that's apart from, like, UCLA and Cal Berkeley and the others, or is that part of the CSU system?

05:03.899 --> 05:08.807
You're an East Coaster, so you have to explain the California craziness.

05:10.069 --> 05:23.751
California has had a tradition of a very strong public education sector, and it has a community college system of over 120 community colleges.

05:24.652 --> 05:31.223
It has the CSU system, the California State University system, and that

05:31.844 --> 05:41.790
about 25 years ago was sort of a coalescing of state teacher colleges that were around the state.

05:41.850 --> 05:48.908
So we have San Diego State, San Francisco State, Sacramento State, Humboldt State.

05:49.327 --> 06:04.705
Those were campuses that really existed before, and then campuses that have been added, California State University at Dominguez Hills, California State University Northridge.

06:05.646 --> 06:12.834
It turns out that the California Maritime Academy now just is part of the California State University System.

06:12.854 --> 06:16.819
So the California State University System is,

06:17.508 --> 06:30.468
is part of the overall California State educational structure where you have community colleges, 120 or so of them that offer AA degrees, and any student who graduates from a high school can get into a community college.

06:30.888 --> 06:32.311
Yeah, these are two-year degrees, right?

06:32.331 --> 06:34.153
Two-year degrees.

06:34.174 --> 06:44.950
Students who graduate with a B or better are automatically admitted to any of the California State University campuses, and those are four-year institutions.

06:45.588 --> 06:50.254
primarily offering bachelor's degrees, but they also concur master's degrees.

06:50.695 --> 06:51.015
I see.

06:51.376 --> 06:58.286
Then you have the UC system, and that's your Berserkleys and the like.

06:58.326 --> 07:02.391
There's, I think, nine campuses in the UC system.

07:02.571 --> 07:06.056
UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara.

07:06.076 --> 07:06.737
Riverside.

07:08.740 --> 07:12.405
And those are the four-year research institutions.

07:14.630 --> 07:21.989
And then you have the private institutions, the Stanford's and the University of the... Caltech.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.092
Those sorts of things.

07:23.112 --> 07:23.794
Right.

07:23.814 --> 07:24.696
Okay.

07:25.298 --> 07:26.461
Okay.

07:26.481 --> 07:27.323
Our campus...

07:27.826 --> 07:31.832
was not in the formal long-term planning.

07:31.872 --> 07:42.208
And so a lot of community involvement, a lot of the educators in the CSU system, and generally, what should a campus be and what are we going to do?

07:42.268 --> 07:44.511
And so the campus has a mission statement.

07:45.252 --> 07:46.694
I've seen that on the net, by the way.

07:46.715 --> 07:49.699
If you get onto the webpage, and that...

07:50.067 --> 07:52.434
We've managed to make it be at least proper English.

07:54.119 --> 07:57.730
I don't know if you read the George Will piece about our campus not too long ago.

07:57.750 --> 07:58.873
No, I didn't.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.140
Well, if you want, last weekend.

08:01.492 --> 08:04.735
George Will did a piece of digging on our new campus.

08:04.875 --> 08:05.155
Really?

08:05.275 --> 08:06.396
Where was this published?

08:07.157 --> 08:08.919
Washington Post.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.061
I did a LexisNexis search.

08:11.081 --> 08:11.761
It was interesting.

08:11.841 --> 08:12.802
It didn't pop up.

08:13.483 --> 08:14.844
It just came out.

08:15.304 --> 08:18.327
George Will in last week's post, right?

08:18.948 --> 08:20.009
What did he knock it for?

08:20.209 --> 08:20.950
Aesthetics?

08:21.850 --> 08:24.132
Well, that he could because it looks like an Army base.

08:24.152 --> 08:26.675
Because it looks like an Army base, I guess, right now, right?

08:26.695 --> 08:30.418
He knocked it because we have universities.

08:30.753 --> 08:34.018
university learning requirement, we call it U.S.

08:34.198 --> 08:43.531
histories with an S. And his concern was over political correctness and arbitrary language.

08:44.513 --> 08:46.756
Basically, we are trying to be different.

08:46.776 --> 08:53.746
And in being different, sometimes you're not as articulate as one probably needs to be.

08:53.766 --> 08:58.633
And particularly if you have a whole campus that just is two and a half years old,

08:58.883 --> 09:03.628
it's easy to find, you know, laws in the fabric.

09:03.648 --> 09:07.091
But back to your initial question about the library.

09:07.231 --> 09:08.112
Okay.

09:08.152 --> 09:15.919
And where we say, so we're a new campus, we're reused, so we couldn't build a building from the ground up that was a library.

09:15.939 --> 09:17.641
We had buildings that we had to renovate.

09:19.122 --> 09:26.089
So as we're even thinking about, you know, what should a building be, what should be a learning space, how big should be a library,

09:27.166 --> 09:31.831
the people who are doing the planning, we've really done a change here.

09:33.994 --> 09:35.396
I'm sorry, they said what?

09:35.416 --> 09:40.401
We've really got a change happening in our society right now.

09:41.302 --> 09:52.736
Traditionally, the way you value the library, whether it's a Harvard or a Stanford, the first thing that comes up in the size of the library is the number of volumes it has.

09:53.877 --> 09:54.878
The library has

09:55.583 --> 10:05.640
and the academic academy serves as a repository of the scholarly work, and particularly in Ph.D.

10:05.700 --> 10:10.708
training institutions, that's the home of rest for the thesis, which is the research.

10:13.332 --> 10:16.798
But for, and many times at,

10:18.196 --> 10:21.821
major universities, they'll sometimes have an undergraduate library.

10:22.142 --> 10:22.863
Oh, yeah.

10:22.983 --> 10:29.133
You know, this library has all the great works, all the books that an undergraduate student should have access and should be here 24 hours.

10:29.153 --> 10:33.539
And then there's reserve rooms where people get stuff.

10:33.559 --> 10:37.425
So really the issue here is... Special collections as well, of course.

10:37.465 --> 10:38.767
Special collections as well.

10:38.827 --> 10:40.910
But the issue here is access.

10:40.930 --> 10:45.958
How do we get access to the information our students need?

10:46.462 --> 10:50.125
And how do we do it with the limited financial resources we have?

10:50.266 --> 10:53.409
And in this case, somewhat the limited space resources that we have.

10:54.530 --> 10:59.254
Even if we had all the money in the world, we couldn't create this humongously large library.

11:01.496 --> 11:13.468
So one thing that we did is that we were in an area where we had a number of community colleges, maybe postgraduate school, Santa Cruz not far away.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.810
So we said, let's work out

11:15.993 --> 11:27.150
very strong, truly working collaborative arrangements with the libraries that are in the area for access and access to materials that we may not have no matter what.

11:27.873 --> 11:33.919
And interlibrary loan exists, but we said, let's not say interlibrary loan, it takes two weeks to get it.

11:33.939 --> 11:39.625
Let's really figure out what does it take for our students to get access to the resources that are here.

11:40.345 --> 11:44.810
It's a little bit when you see a Starbucks next to a New York bagel.

11:45.911 --> 11:50.015
There are two different companies, but there was a synergy there that made sense.

11:50.435 --> 11:57.222
So very early on, we made sure that our student library cards had all the privileges for the libraries that were physically in the area.

11:58.501 --> 12:07.612
The second thing that we looked at is that we have to decide what periodicals or what subscriptions we want, because that's one of, again, the areas that students need to work.

12:07.632 --> 12:22.591
So we had a choice between buying subscriptions to all these periodicals or buying access to them with the ability to let the students get the exact articles that they need.

12:23.252 --> 12:26.095
And again, in our library, rather than doing as many...

12:26.800 --> 12:41.798
periodical descriptions, what we did is got greater access, not only access to the reference material, but the permission to get the full printed document sent to us and the copyright fee and all that.

12:42.479 --> 12:53.652
So our students really have greater access to an article out of a research journal than any other CSU, because

12:54.340 --> 13:05.795
We're using our funds to pay for the access for the stuff that our students need, not necessarily paying the access for a journal that sits on a shelf until somebody happens to need it.

13:05.835 --> 13:19.954
So it's a philosophical change, partly brought about because of, you know, confined resources in both finances and physical plant, but also in saying what is the problem we're trying to solve.

13:19.974 --> 13:22.778
We're trying to make sure our students have the information they need

13:23.332 --> 13:27.944
And we have methods where we can get things rapidly.

13:28.405 --> 13:32.797
You know, students have come in, found something in Nexus and Lexis.

13:32.817 --> 13:35.123
Our library ordered it.

13:35.143 --> 13:38.151
It was electronically delivered, and they picked it up that day.

13:39.768 --> 13:41.991
I don't know whether that answers.

13:42.011 --> 13:43.653
Well, that's, yeah, that starts it.

13:44.093 --> 13:57.550
But now also, on the website, there's also a collection policy, and it says very clearly, it says, to the extent possible and economically feasible, the CSUMB library uses electronic resources instead of print.

13:57.710 --> 14:01.455
So that's the policy, that if it's available electronically,

14:01.435 --> 14:03.098
That's what a priority is.

14:03.178 --> 14:09.290
And that is kind of a philosophical position, too, wouldn't you say?

14:09.350 --> 14:12.396
I mean, that you are saying, listen, if it's available.

14:12.977 --> 14:22.054
I'm not taking a position on this, but clearly I think what you're suggesting here is that this is an institution for the 21st century.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.456
We have the technology here.

14:23.577 --> 14:24.338
It works.

14:24.318 --> 14:29.387
It's available to us, and if it's available electronically, that will be the preferred medium.

14:30.609 --> 14:34.075
Let me give you another sort of twist on why you're doing that.

14:34.636 --> 14:36.420
One, you could say it's a philosophy.

14:37.321 --> 14:44.554
Our campus is less than 4% of the old Fort Ord.

14:45.158 --> 14:48.841
We have 1,500 students on our campus.

14:48.861 --> 14:50.202
1,500 students, right?

14:50.222 --> 14:50.743
1,500.

14:51.564 --> 15:04.956
And for the water allocation that we have for our 3% of the former base, we have faculty and student and staff housing here.

15:05.076 --> 15:08.679
We have 1,200 housing units.

15:09.760 --> 15:14.524
So we have residential, not only students, but we have faculty and staff living here.

15:15.044 --> 15:26.936
So we have, in our water allocation for the space that we have, the ability to grow to serving about 10,000 students on our physical footprint.

15:27.036 --> 15:28.458
And is that the projection?

15:29.378 --> 15:41.050
Well, the projection, though, is the state really feels that as we build a campus, this campus needs to serve about 25,000.

15:41.310 --> 15:43.853
So there's a delta.

15:44.997 --> 15:46.919
There's a major difference.

15:46.959 --> 15:47.820
What did you call that again?

15:48.461 --> 15:50.243
A delta, you know, a shift.

15:50.343 --> 15:50.783
Okay.

15:50.803 --> 15:51.604
Okay.

15:51.724 --> 16:02.956
So we have some 16,000 or 15,000 students that we say we want to serve, but they can't be here on campus.

16:03.337 --> 16:07.721
We humorously refer to it as our toilet blessing problem.

16:07.741 --> 16:10.144
We could have more students as long as they don't use the toilet.

16:11.221 --> 16:23.620
So we have a very aggressive plan for what we call distributed learning, or students who participate with the campus without physically being on campus.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.184
And that's our distance and online opportunities.

16:26.264 --> 16:28.808
And by the year 2005, we want to have a...

16:29.260 --> 16:32.924
the 1,500 of those students physically off campus.

16:32.964 --> 16:34.806
By the year 2-0-0-5.

16:34.946 --> 16:38.110
Yeah, our target is about 1,500 students.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.252
About the same size we are now on campus.

16:40.272 --> 16:43.696
We want to be off campus.

16:43.796 --> 16:46.559
And this is also for the taking of classes?

16:46.599 --> 16:47.460
This is for everything?

16:47.720 --> 16:48.902
And this is where you can win, right?

16:49.202 --> 16:57.411
Well, meeting the goals and objectives of doing what our mission is, to have students who are...

16:58.268 --> 16:59.189
Multilingual.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.332
We require second language competency.

17:03.013 --> 17:10.320
We want them to be socially conscious.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.463
Our students are required to do service learning activities.

17:14.624 --> 17:26.335
We want our students to embrace diversity in a sense that we figure we're in a global society, not just a national society.

17:26.686 --> 17:29.910
So if you go through the mission statement, we have these various missions.

17:29.930 --> 17:55.225
You go through educational programs, and we want a student who may have decided to do a four-year residency program here to come out with the same competencies and outcomes than a student who might actually have spent only six months here and did the rest of their interactions with our faculty and our learning experiences through some mediated form, which required them not physically to be here on campus.

17:56.234 --> 18:01.161
Okay.

18:01.442 --> 18:24.216
Now, if you think about that, then it is obvious that our library wants to make sure wherever it can that has electronic materials available, because if we didn't have those materials available and we needed to serve a student wherever we can, if that student needed something, if we had electronic,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.953
we could just send it out.

18:26.974 --> 18:33.764
Where if it were a book, we're back to, you've got to put it into a box, you've got to ship it, you know, all those different things.

18:35.888 --> 18:39.554
Chris, how many books are not available through electronic means?

18:39.614 --> 18:40.876
I mean, thousands.

18:42.719 --> 18:44.742
I mean, everything is not available electronically.

18:44.762 --> 18:45.142
We know that.

18:45.163 --> 18:46.184
Well, lots of things aren't available.

18:46.204 --> 18:48.428
There's lots of things where we don't have that option.

18:48.588 --> 18:49.169
That's my thing, too.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.132
And that's where the question is,

18:51.483 --> 19:03.146
There are certain things, historical documents, there's books that are out of print, there's all sorts of things that, there's the Gutenberg, you know, project, but it's far from complete.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.932
Plus, it's also copyright sensitive, I mean.

19:05.972 --> 19:13.086
Copyright sensitive, and there may be, you know, there's eight different versions of Moby Dick, and

19:13.538 --> 19:16.481
Some of them are electronic, but some are only in print.

19:17.262 --> 19:23.728
So the library's goal here is not, you know, and this is what got people in trouble with, well, we're only going to do electronic stuff.

19:23.848 --> 19:24.068
No.

19:26.891 --> 19:29.293
When it's available, that would be our preference.

19:30.014 --> 19:33.957
When it's needed, we would get it for our students in whatever way it took.

19:35.699 --> 19:36.299
Let's do that again.

19:36.319 --> 19:38.161
When it's available, that will be our preference.

19:39.122 --> 19:40.103
When it's needed,

19:40.724 --> 19:41.305
What did you say?

19:41.765 --> 19:52.095
We will assess it, you know, we'll provide it to our students in whatever way we can, which ranges from us buying it or us getting it through interlibrary loans.

19:56.859 --> 20:01.443
See, right now we haven't established our distance learning program very aggressively.

20:01.464 --> 20:02.444
We're just growing.

20:03.185 --> 20:10.512
But the same sort of areas where we let our students access libraries that were not on our campuses but other campuses,

20:11.015 --> 20:13.079
We may have to do a similar sort of thing.

20:13.139 --> 20:21.733
If we have a student who happens to be in Chicago, we may need to come up with some sort of collaborative arrangement so that the student needs a library.

20:22.454 --> 20:28.585
There's something we don't have electronically we can't get to them, but we know it's available at the Northwestern Library.

20:29.166 --> 20:34.575
We may have to figure out what do we have to pay that university to give us access for our students.

20:38.082 --> 20:43.828
Now, also on the website, it says print collections, 34,000 books.

20:44.108 --> 20:44.949
That's pretty small.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.352
Would you agree that that's pretty small?

20:47.372 --> 20:48.173
We think it's real small.

20:50.856 --> 20:55.460
Smaller than, you know, despite what we say, that's smaller than what we would like it to be.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.885
And that's a pretty accurate figure, right?

20:59.945 --> 21:02.047
About 34,000, I guess.

21:02.308 --> 21:02.588
No, no.

21:03.091 --> 21:06.615
You'll have to look at the bottom of the web page to see when they update it.

21:06.635 --> 21:07.476
Yeah, it was updated.

21:07.536 --> 21:08.136
I did, actually.

21:08.156 --> 21:13.002
It was, like, I think it was through, like, September or October of 97.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.563
So it's probably four or five months.

21:15.264 --> 21:22.292
Yeah, well, that number was really pretty accurate to what we have, and I know we did a fair amount of acquisition this year.

21:22.372 --> 21:28.018
So, you know, if this is going to go in the print, print...

21:28.505 --> 21:29.526
Oh, I'll update it.

21:29.546 --> 21:30.267
You can be sure.

21:30.748 --> 21:31.909
I do have some names.

21:32.730 --> 21:33.571
Steve Watkins.

21:33.591 --> 21:34.913
Yeah, I have his name.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.137
You're my first talk.

21:38.237 --> 21:39.959
I hope to talk to a few people.

21:40.439 --> 21:41.460
Yeah, let's see.

21:41.481 --> 21:42.562
Whose name do I have?

21:44.604 --> 21:45.986
Do I have Watkins' name here?

21:46.286 --> 21:46.907
I think I should have.

21:47.348 --> 21:50.772
Well, Steve Watkins.

21:50.792 --> 21:51.392
Yeah, 582-3793.

21:51.432 --> 21:52.093
I do have his name.

21:52.173 --> 21:52.273
Okay.

21:52.293 --> 21:56.959
There's another person who unfortunately just left, but you probably should talk to him.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.485
And that's John Ober.

22:00.927 --> 22:01.387
John?

22:02.549 --> 22:03.450
B-E-R.

22:03.650 --> 22:04.051
Okay.

22:04.952 --> 22:21.111
And John just, he was on our campus, and we hate to see him go, but he just left the campus to go join a statewide initiative for a state electronic library and interconnecting all our libraries.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.554
So the idea of...

22:24.563 --> 22:30.670
of making electronic resources and the resources of libraries that aren't electronic to cover that issue.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.491
Sure.

22:31.531 --> 22:32.352
Where did he go?

22:32.732 --> 22:35.055
Where would I be able to reach him, do you think?

22:35.696 --> 22:36.597
Is he in California?

22:36.737 --> 22:37.758
He's in California.

22:37.778 --> 22:39.440
The offices are in San Francisco.

22:39.460 --> 22:47.729
I think if you call, I think his e-mail address still may be working here, or if you call to the library and say you're trying to reach John.

22:47.749 --> 22:47.849
Okay.

22:47.889 --> 22:52.174
Well, what I'll do is I'll talk to Steve Watkins, and I'll bet he can connect with you.

22:52.194 --> 22:54.317
Yeah, Steve will know how to get him.

22:54.437 --> 22:54.537
Okay.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.203
John, he just left.

22:57.284 --> 22:59.026
He has to send back a forwarding address.

23:00.527 --> 23:01.489
What was his title?

23:01.509 --> 23:02.350
What was his position?

23:02.750 --> 23:12.542
Well, he was one of the librarians on campus, but now he's going to the California State Library.

23:13.162 --> 23:19.370
Now, do you have a severely limited budget for acquisitions?

23:20.551 --> 23:22.954
Would you say that your acquisitions are limited by...

23:23.710 --> 23:30.096
pardon me, by what you have to spend on books, materials, etc.?

23:33.179 --> 23:35.241
I've been rich and I've been poor and rich is better.

23:35.341 --> 23:45.330
I mean, I think it's a hard, it's hard to say whether, you know, that's a Steve thing.

23:45.650 --> 23:46.431
Okay, I'll talk to him.

23:46.451 --> 23:50.595
He's a faculty member, I would say, when you look at,

23:51.453 --> 23:54.137
The campus is probably underfunded in general.

23:54.177 --> 23:55.979
Higher ed is underfunded.

23:55.999 --> 24:00.144
Higher education in terms of state support and private support.

24:01.266 --> 24:09.877
You know, now it used to be in our system that, you know, 90% of the tuition costs were covered by the state.

24:10.018 --> 24:14.564
Now 70% of it is covered by the state.

24:15.184 --> 24:18.709
So I would hate to say that we don't, you know,

24:19.060 --> 24:30.372
to say that we have enough money, I also don't want to say that I think we don't have enough because in a day-to-day working with students, you know, did you need something?

24:30.552 --> 24:31.473
Were you able to get it?

24:31.673 --> 24:32.314
Yes, they were.

24:32.374 --> 24:34.376
And that's really the bottom line.

24:35.457 --> 24:47.970
Was a resource that was needed for a learner to fulfill an educational goal or outcome available in a timely manner?

24:51.730 --> 25:03.546
You know, it really shifts what we're assessing from how many books are in the library to how many students read something that they needed to learn from.

25:03.566 --> 25:10.615
Chris, traditionally, the library has been perceived as the soul of a university, of a college.

25:11.256 --> 25:11.677
Yeah.

25:11.697 --> 25:19.467
Where kids, you know, I mean, it's not strictly the repository for books.

25:20.709 --> 25:20.809
Yeah.

25:21.076 --> 25:26.804
And I think that's an interesting thing to talk about because of our official constraints.

25:26.924 --> 25:28.826
Our campus doesn't have a student union.

25:30.989 --> 25:34.975
Our campus doesn't have, you know, a library lounge.

25:36.697 --> 25:42.024
You know, back in my days, you went to the Northwestern Library to get dates.

25:42.044 --> 25:42.305
That's right.

25:42.325 --> 25:42.645
That's right.

25:44.903 --> 25:49.348
When we opened our campus, we didn't even get on the campus for the first couple months.

25:49.428 --> 25:51.711
We had to go in temporary buildings.

25:52.412 --> 25:57.357
We were in elementary schools that had closed on the base with still little chairs.

25:57.437 --> 26:05.006
So the students felt when the campus opened, they finally got into higher education because the chairs were full light.

26:06.107 --> 26:11.974
Because of that, our email system has in many ways

26:12.680 --> 26:18.206
done a lot of the things that traditionally happened in the library lounge or in the student union.

26:19.467 --> 26:24.973
The ride board for sale, announcing events.

26:27.515 --> 26:29.297
We have what we call open forum.

26:29.377 --> 26:33.281
Sometimes it scares the administration's death.

26:33.401 --> 26:40.408
And we've had, you know, a number of both instances of things that have happened on campus.

26:40.428 --> 26:41.910
And it was amazing.

26:42.683 --> 26:51.341
how our electronic access really became the heartbeat.

26:52.263 --> 26:59.057
Again, I remember I'm a product of the 60s.

26:59.338 --> 27:01.442
We closed down campuses.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.747
We didn't blow up banks, but...

27:04.182 --> 27:13.970
And I know that there was, you know, where the students for the Democratic Society met and, you know, where did you run to find out what was happening.

27:14.030 --> 27:21.036
Here, when you hear there's a scandal going on, which we had, you know, a faculty member charged with sexual harassment.

27:21.056 --> 27:33.987
We had a hassle about an incident between some football players from the community college that were living on our campus and some students

27:34.523 --> 27:39.988
when you hear something's happening, you log on to open forum because you wanted to know what's happening.

27:40.969 --> 27:48.456
And just as the students, most of, and I don't get papers handed in.

27:48.496 --> 27:49.917
They get turned in electronically.

27:50.498 --> 27:51.459
Is that right?

27:52.360 --> 27:59.887
And I have students turn things into me in PDF format, and I mark them up on screen and send them back.

28:00.808 --> 28:03.450
And we get, in a sense, jaded.

28:04.544 --> 28:11.453
We're sitting there and somebody has an actual, you know, book or something and they need to write a citation.

28:12.194 --> 28:14.016
It's so much harder when you have to type it all in.

28:14.036 --> 28:20.945
It's so much easier to, you know, be able to clip the citation, you know, from the header of the document that you have.

28:20.965 --> 28:22.407
Sure.

28:22.427 --> 28:24.290
So papers are handed in electronically?

28:24.670 --> 28:26.512
Yes.

28:26.613 --> 28:30.377
And that's also for students who are on campus as well as the distance?

28:30.398 --> 28:30.718
Oh, yeah.

28:32.020 --> 28:32.220
Oh, yeah.

28:32.260 --> 28:32.340
Wow.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.462
I should come out and visit it.

28:35.482 --> 28:37.424
It's a unique environment.

28:37.444 --> 28:43.712
You know, I'm a product of the 60s myself, so it really is a paradigm shift, isn't it, as they say?

28:44.853 --> 29:00.673
Well, and, you know, I don't like necessarily reading from the screen all the time, and we still do a lot of printing, you know, so, you know, sometimes I'll

29:01.143 --> 29:07.811
You know, students will send things electronically, and I'll ask my sister or whatever, say, will you print these things out so I can take them on a plane?

29:07.851 --> 29:08.712
I'm going on a trip.

29:12.076 --> 29:16.061
You know, so it's not universal love, you know.

29:17.603 --> 29:20.647
And I've lost less student papers.

29:20.727 --> 29:25.092
I haven't lost any student papers, but now it's in the electronic folder, and I pack up my words.

29:25.932 --> 29:34.874
And I don't have the problem typically, you know, if the student calls or sends me an e-mail to say, well, your paper's in the office.

29:35.636 --> 29:37.561
But also, you know, it's really funny.

29:37.701 --> 29:40.127
The student turns in his paper at midnight.

29:40.698 --> 29:46.006
And then at 10 o'clock the next morning, they'll send you an email saying, how did you like it?

29:46.026 --> 29:47.548
Like you have nothing else to do, right?

29:47.688 --> 29:51.634
Well, my computer enjoyed it a great deal, but I haven't had the chance to open it and look at it.

29:52.736 --> 29:55.840
Can you describe physically what the library is like?

29:55.881 --> 30:01.108
I mean, is it a place where kids can go in and do their work there, sit down?

30:01.228 --> 30:05.315
We have, there's a computer lab there, and there's study carols.

30:06.076 --> 30:07.558
It looks like any other library.

30:07.578 --> 30:08.359
It has stacks.

30:09.740 --> 30:14.267
and then it has some other places where there are access terminals to information.

30:15.248 --> 30:22.539
The Chronicle of Higher Education said, I guess you have seven computer centers, is that right, on the campus?

30:22.899 --> 30:39.443
Well, I think, yeah, in terms of, again, in terms of the library, for library research, you know, a lot of times students are doing library research without being in the library because any of the labs that have the computer can go onto the library and search our database.

30:42.646 --> 30:45.666
There's only a few of the indices.

30:45.706 --> 30:47.458
There's some indices because of...
