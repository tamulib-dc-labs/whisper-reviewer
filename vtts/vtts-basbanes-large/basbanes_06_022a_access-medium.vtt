WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:07.997
Testing, one, two, three, four, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test.

00:08.017 --> 00:11.665
I just got, that depends on how you define hardened criminal.

00:11.886 --> 00:16.656
In my view, he perhaps is a more hardened criminal than many that I see because

00:17.007 --> 00:20.656
He did steal the cultural heritage of the United States.

00:21.217 --> 00:25.568
He's much more hardened than many people that we see here.

00:25.588 --> 00:26.952
What do you think of his testimony?

00:26.972 --> 00:33.548
Was it Kenny Rhodes testified that Bloomberg would say that he was insane if he was at a property?

00:34.000 --> 00:41.012
It would be speculating for me to say what was the turning point for the jury, and I just would decline to do that.

00:41.733 --> 00:50.828
Would someone say that 35 years might be a pretty hard sentence for someone who's just stole some books and didn't hurt anybody, killed anybody?

00:50.848 --> 00:56.397
Well, again, it depends on what your definition is of what he did.

00:56.748 --> 01:01.295
He didn't just steal library books out of a public library.

01:01.496 --> 01:12.774
He stole rare, irreplaceable manuscripts, books, in quantities that no one can ever imagine, 20,000 different volumes.

01:13.715 --> 01:24.392
The court will be limited by the federal sentencing guidelines as to what sentence can be imposed, but I disagree that a 35-year sentence

01:24.659 --> 01:26.502
is outrageous under these circumstances.

01:27.162 --> 01:30.367
You're opposing whether they can stay out of bail prior to sentencing?

01:30.387 --> 01:31.008
Absolutely.

01:31.328 --> 01:36.836
This man just stole 10 million dollars worth of public property.

01:38.117 --> 01:39.940
How can you justify that?

01:40.881 --> 01:41.362
I can.

01:43.104 --> 01:48.552
Did you send any message that the jury came back for the question?

01:48.592 --> 01:48.912
I never

01:49.077 --> 01:54.622
speculate at what goes on in the jury room, so I don't know.

01:54.702 --> 02:08.695
While the NGRI not guilty by reason of insanity defense was unsuccessful, do you acknowledge at least that he probably does require some attention, medical attention?

02:08.715 --> 02:09.976
I am not a physician.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.457
I am not a psychiatrist.

02:11.537 --> 02:18.223
The federal prison system is very well equipped to make an evaluation and decide.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.007
How much of a fine could he face?

02:21.268 --> 02:23.371
On four counts, it would be a million dollars.

02:24.532 --> 02:28.818
Do you have any idea what you'll be seeking?

02:29.158 --> 02:33.423
Actually, at this point, I haven't thought far enough, that far ahead.

02:34.324 --> 02:35.185
I can't tell you.

02:35.206 --> 02:36.027
Are you happy it's over?

02:36.087 --> 02:37.729
After all these months, it's almost a year.

02:37.969 --> 02:38.229
Yes.

02:39.611 --> 02:42.895
We are looking forward to returning the books to their owners.

02:43.111 --> 02:45.414
getting them back to the public where they belong.

02:45.835 --> 02:47.477
How long of a process do you think that will be?

02:47.497 --> 02:49.901
Will you start that process now, the return of the books?

02:49.921 --> 03:03.280
Yes, I have made a commitment to the libraries that helped us in this case to proceed with the return of the books that were the subject matter of this trial as quickly as possible, as quickly as I can do it through the court system.

03:03.547 --> 03:12.621
The remaining books, we will make every effort to find the owners and return them as quickly as possible, but that is an enormous job.

03:13.102 --> 03:17.289
There is so much work left to do that I can't even describe that to you.

03:17.309 --> 03:25.622
The books have been carved up, the ownership marks have been removed, and it is going to continue to be a very...

03:26.480 --> 03:26.860
Excuse me.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.522
Difficult job for the government.

03:28.562 --> 03:30.064
Very difficult.

03:30.084 --> 03:30.544
Thanks, Linda.

03:30.744 --> 03:31.085
Linda.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.166
Thank you so much.

03:32.186 --> 03:32.546
Yeah.

03:32.707 --> 03:33.607
Good job.

03:34.028 --> 03:34.308
Thanks.

03:34.368 --> 03:35.069
Thanks.

03:35.089 --> 03:35.509
You bet.

03:36.651 --> 03:37.391
Sit down, Mr. Rosenberg.

03:37.411 --> 03:38.312
That's all right, Ray.

03:38.373 --> 03:38.973
That's all right.

03:38.993 --> 03:41.376
Keep going off of any comments you have.

03:41.436 --> 03:41.876
Come right over here.

03:41.896 --> 03:46.861
You might be the simplest.

03:46.982 --> 03:48.003
One or either of you can answer this.

03:48.123 --> 03:51.687
Do you truly believe that your client is insane?

03:51.767 --> 03:52.167
Well.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.176
We think that there was an evidentiary basis.

03:55.216 --> 03:57.638
We think we were compelled to raise the defense.

03:57.658 --> 03:59.039
It was a hard-fought case.

04:00.461 --> 04:03.183
The jury came back in disagreement.

04:03.203 --> 04:04.885
That's it.

04:04.905 --> 04:08.008
We don't regret what we're doing.

04:08.028 --> 04:11.351
What did your client say after the verdict?

04:11.371 --> 04:11.931
Not at liberty.

04:11.991 --> 04:12.552
We can't do that.

04:12.572 --> 04:15.215
Can't disclose any confidential communication.

04:15.295 --> 04:21.040
Are you hopeful that the judge will take into account his mental condition even though your defense was unsuccessful and perhaps...

04:21.256 --> 04:25.321
require him to have some treatment instead of hard time incarceration?

04:25.341 --> 04:29.025
Yeah, you're getting into our legal positions.

04:29.045 --> 04:29.345
Right.

04:29.545 --> 04:35.112
What about your estimate of what the most damaging testimony was?

04:35.132 --> 04:36.994
I don't want to go back and recount the case.

04:37.815 --> 04:44.162
I just don't feel that there's anything that particularly stands out.

04:44.983 --> 04:50.149
As far as the evidence concerned, I just think the jury concluded that there's no vulnerability.

04:50.872 --> 05:01.564
Any regrets?

05:01.684 --> 05:02.385
No regrets.

05:02.625 --> 05:05.568
Evidence is clearly there.

05:06.769 --> 05:09.553
Was not expert witnesses who said he was.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.996
Do you plan any sort of appeal?

05:14.118 --> 05:17.641
I didn't really want to discuss that.

05:17.661 --> 05:18.162
The case is not over yet.

05:18.783 --> 05:22.366
Are you hopeful that Mr. Blumberg will be released prior to sentencing?

05:23.347 --> 05:25.149
We're going to find that out at 3 o'clock tomorrow.

05:25.749 --> 05:29.212
We've got a hearing on that issue, and we're going to fight for that.

05:29.252 --> 05:31.775
And the judge is going to have to make a decision.

05:31.795 --> 05:32.796
You've got here a minute late.

05:32.816 --> 05:36.719
What was your initial reaction to the verdict?

05:39.202 --> 05:39.782
Is it sunk in yet?

05:40.323 --> 05:41.083
Oh, it's sunk in.

05:41.544 --> 05:44.686
Do you accept the verdict, and the jury has spoken, and you move on from there?

05:45.487 --> 05:47.809
There were three forms of verdict.

05:47.829 --> 05:48.570
One of them.

05:48.905 --> 05:57.895
This man really mystifies a lot of people.

05:57.915 --> 06:01.078
How would you guys, now that you've worked with him all this time, describe him?

06:01.098 --> 06:05.243
I'm not going to characterize him.

06:05.383 --> 06:07.905
Ask the jurors.

06:07.925 --> 06:09.767
Yeah.

06:09.787 --> 06:18.777
You talked about the hearing to determine the freedom or the temporary freedom of pending sentencing.

06:19.297 --> 06:38.802
I was disappointed with the verdict, but the verdict stands.

06:38.822 --> 06:40.223
We just have to leave it there.

06:40.664 --> 06:41.525
And we have to go on.

06:41.886 --> 06:43.327
The case is not over yet.

06:43.407 --> 06:44.229
Sentencing remains.

06:45.150 --> 06:46.211
We're still his advocates.

06:46.231 --> 06:46.992
We're going to continue on.

06:49.975 --> 06:52.879
It's too early.

06:52.939 --> 06:57.907
What other avenues did you look at now?

06:57.927 --> 07:01.953
I don't want to get into any strategy.

07:01.973 --> 07:03.155
Thanks a lot.

07:03.535 --> 07:08.403
Were you anxious while the jury was out?

07:08.423 --> 07:10.065
Prosecutors are always anxious.

07:10.165 --> 07:12.409
Lawyers are always anxious when the jury's out.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.532
Not just this case, every case.

07:15.473 --> 07:17.957
I mean, at the beginning, I would have said,

07:18.494 --> 07:22.598
There was 101 shot of an NGRI, possibly scoring.

07:23.319 --> 07:23.979
Of the what?

07:24.019 --> 07:27.102
Not guilty by reason of insanity, making it.

07:27.463 --> 07:28.604
I couldn't even imagine.

07:28.624 --> 07:33.348
I thought that would be a desperate attempt in the beginning for a defense.

07:33.368 --> 07:36.171
But towards the end, people were wondering which way you think it's going to go.

07:36.211 --> 07:41.356
Just the fact that it had people uncertain about the outcome.

07:41.376 --> 07:44.299
Were you at all uncertain about the outcome?

07:44.633 --> 07:48.479
I was not uncertain as to what the outcome should be.

07:49.741 --> 07:53.506
I never doubted that.

07:53.526 --> 07:54.187
I'm back on.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.432
That's what I thought.

07:57.452 --> 07:59.134
Yes.

07:59.155 --> 08:02.319
And what was that?

08:02.339 --> 08:03.281
I can't remember what it was.

08:03.341 --> 08:03.902
Well, 35 years.

08:03.922 --> 08:05.304
Yeah, 35 years.

08:05.624 --> 08:07.767
Yeah, count one is a five-year count.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.111
Counts two, three, and four are 10-year counts.

08:10.391 --> 08:11.453
Oh, I know what the other thing was.

08:11.893 --> 08:14.337
No, I forgot it again.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.493
Oh, I know.

08:15.513 --> 08:18.077
About the books, how quickly can they go?

08:18.097 --> 08:20.660
I mean, do you have like a sense of time period?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.762
You've just sort of said you're moving along.

08:23.864 --> 08:25.586
I would say as quickly as possible.

08:25.606 --> 08:32.334
Obviously, the books that have been identified may be returned more quickly than the ones that we're still puzzled about.

08:32.375 --> 08:33.336
Okay.

08:33.916 --> 08:35.178
Well, I'm going to get out of your hair.

08:35.298 --> 08:39.143
Any sense, and it's not necessarily related to Mr. Bloomberg, but have you ever been...

08:40.102 --> 08:45.547
I don't believe there is such a thing.

08:46.148 --> 08:46.848
You did a great job.

08:47.168 --> 08:48.269
You don't believe it?

08:48.290 --> 08:48.630
Honestly?

08:48.850 --> 08:49.010
No.

08:49.290 --> 08:49.851
You can ask him.

08:49.911 --> 08:51.452
I was predicting you'd win one minute.

08:52.734 --> 08:54.195
He predicted that he would be found guilty.

08:54.215 --> 08:54.675
That's correct.

08:56.357 --> 09:00.000
And I bet you thought that I wouldn't.

09:00.020 --> 09:02.182
I thought that... They would win.

09:02.222 --> 09:04.064
They would win.

09:04.084 --> 09:05.085
But I've never picked one way.

09:05.125 --> 09:05.866
But he's a book collector.

09:05.886 --> 09:07.487
You've got to watch for people like him, you know?

09:07.507 --> 09:08.488
Well...

09:09.177 --> 09:10.578
Just kidding.

09:10.919 --> 09:12.700
He looks like a sick kid to me.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.705
I mean... But the point is... Maybe it's because I'm married to a social worker, you know?

09:17.725 --> 09:19.006
Yeah.

09:19.607 --> 09:25.493
He looks... I think he definitely needs some help.

09:25.653 --> 09:27.515
You would probably even evaluate that yourself.

09:28.155 --> 09:28.836
I would not.

09:29.176 --> 09:36.163
I believe that it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to evaluate where he's at psychiatrically.

09:36.515 --> 10:02.927
and to make that decision i'm just a prosecutor that's all i have to say thank you and i'll say that with the tape on i was exceedingly impressed i mean you made your case there was no question that he stole the books that you did everything that you said he did the musical instruments i might have said no one i mean if it were just if there wasn't a question of his stability um the music was

10:03.532 --> 10:05.476
But then again, he knowingly carried them.

10:05.496 --> 10:06.337
Absolutely.

10:06.377 --> 10:07.800
That's all I have to prove.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.623
Not that he intended to steal them.

10:09.663 --> 10:10.264
Not at all.

10:10.345 --> 10:11.867
Just that he drove them across the line.

10:11.907 --> 10:12.408
Right.

10:12.468 --> 10:14.512
Because that's the federal offense.

10:14.532 --> 10:16.596
The federal offense is not the actual theft.

10:17.979 --> 10:19.962
Well, congratulations.

10:19.982 --> 10:20.443
Thanks, Nick.
