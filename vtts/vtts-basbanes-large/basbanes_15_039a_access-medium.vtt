WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:06.493
It was quite an ambitious project.

00:06.874 --> 00:07.895
It was fairly, yes.

00:07.915 --> 00:15.743
You know, I mean, as so often happens, if I'd known what was ahead of me, I might not have taken it on.

00:15.783 --> 00:24.252
But the truth was that I wanted to do a series about American art really since I finished Shock of the New, you know.

00:24.272 --> 00:29.397
I think I wrote the first synopsis back in 82 or 83.

00:29.883 --> 00:39.618
And then at the Beebe they didn't want to do it at first because they thought the day of the didactic miniseries was over.

00:40.118 --> 00:41.400
And, you know, a dinosaur.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.505
MTV was the coming thing.

00:44.525 --> 00:51.335
So it was proposed as a television project and as a book.

00:51.355 --> 00:54.460
Well, I proposed it to the Beebe as a television project, yes.

00:54.580 --> 00:59.147
And, you know, obviously a book would have to come out of it because you don't make money off doing...

00:59.819 --> 01:01.582
this sort of thing for the BBC.

01:01.662 --> 01:06.972
Yeah, but this is not a little pre-season of a television program.

01:06.992 --> 01:07.573
Oh, hell no.

01:07.693 --> 01:08.735
It's a big-ass book.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.237
No, it's a big-ass book.

01:10.257 --> 01:15.847
And, you know, the television series was a great kind of sketch for the book, as it were.

01:16.528 --> 01:19.333
But, you know, in the nature of television, you have to leave so much out.

01:19.413 --> 01:23.160
I mean, eight hours of television time, though it sounds a lot,

01:23.815 --> 01:26.458
Well, I figured 24,000 words.

01:26.778 --> 01:27.979
You said 3,000 words.

01:28.019 --> 01:29.921
Yeah, that's right, 24,000 words.

01:30.242 --> 01:31.823
Well, that's the length of one chapter of the book.

01:31.863 --> 01:32.324
That's right.

01:32.464 --> 01:32.744
Yeah.

01:33.705 --> 01:48.341
But the... And you see, I'd like... I mean, Cate Clark could reprint his script virtually verbatim, you know, and make the book civilization because the scripts were, you know, sort of much longer.

01:48.361 --> 01:49.502
They were more in the nature of

01:52.030 --> 02:00.326
these are films and so, you know, the word card, you know, allowing for interviews and so on and so forth is accordingly smaller.

02:01.067 --> 02:05.776
And in any case, I'm terribly bad at writing short books.

02:07.379 --> 02:13.330
Well, you mentioned some things where there was an interview or something that, 1,200 words a day, I guess,

02:13.681 --> 02:19.327
I had to because the series ran over time in preparation.

02:19.548 --> 02:25.474
My part in it didn't actually end until really the end of March 1996.

02:25.494 --> 02:32.802
Jesus, that's how many of you are now.

02:32.842 --> 02:34.504
Just about 14 months ago.

02:34.564 --> 02:38.068
So I had to deliver the book by the beginning of December.

02:39.128 --> 02:44.836
And, you know, although I'd sort of partially completed one chapter, it wasn't actually much good.

02:45.638 --> 02:56.494
So that meant that I had to really, you know, write the whole thing from, you know, between Easter Sunday and... Did you see a whole?

02:56.694 --> 03:00.239
I mean... Yeah, I did by the time that I got the television series finished.

03:01.361 --> 03:06.549
As a matter of fact, I'd been seeing the basic story and the basic intent.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.832
You know, I had pretty whole...

03:09.250 --> 03:14.255
some years before the teleseries, but as you know, you never really work it out until you actually have to get down and do it.

03:14.295 --> 03:22.363
And of course, to say that I saw the book, I'll even when I'd finished the television series.

03:22.383 --> 03:24.185
Well, the project, let's say, the project.

03:24.685 --> 03:26.027
Yeah, I think I did.

03:26.047 --> 03:27.348
I think I did.

03:27.368 --> 03:28.950
It's evolved.

03:29.630 --> 03:30.932
It's audacious, really.

03:31.332 --> 03:36.237
Well, you know, maybe I'm just long-winded, you know.

03:37.330 --> 03:50.029
But see, you write a book, you know, you do this sort of work in order to find out, you know, it's a great error to suppose that writers, this writer, you know, have all their ducks in the line before they actually begin.

03:50.069 --> 03:54.536
I mean, basically, you write about a large subject in order to find out about it.

03:55.377 --> 03:59.644
You know, that was the case of, you know, Fatal Shore.

03:59.704 --> 04:03.169
I mean, I'd never have dared take it on if I'd known whatnot.

04:08.633 --> 04:09.674
Sure, the pleasure.

04:09.894 --> 04:13.818
But, you know, it's... What can I say?

04:13.838 --> 04:17.441
I mean, hubris has something to do with it.

04:17.461 --> 04:36.598
It would also be, you know, maybe plain folly, but, you know, I think one should... I think the act of finding out as you go along, you know, the act of doing your research as you go along, doing all that reading and stuff, first of all, it forces you to think more intentionally

04:39.464 --> 04:40.506
at the same time.

04:40.526 --> 04:44.471
I mean, it just sort of forces your hand.

04:45.393 --> 04:48.077
Well, you spent three years in the field, so to speak.

04:48.157 --> 04:55.127
Three years in the field, six months aggregate in one week and ten day and two week hops.

04:55.828 --> 05:01.016
But that was great, though, because you were actually able to go out and do the research for the book.

05:01.216 --> 05:01.917
Well, that's correct.

05:01.937 --> 05:03.860
And also, I was able to see a lot of stuff.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.484
I mean, I saw an awful lot of

05:10.919 --> 05:23.631
say, Winslow Homer's paintings, without having visited some of their motifs, that it enriches it to go to Proud's Neck and film there, you know.

05:23.651 --> 05:25.533
In any case, I do what I wish you would like.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.594
Get it right there.

05:26.614 --> 05:28.696
At the time of the light, do what you like.

05:29.136 --> 05:30.798
Ten minutes a day, didn't you?

05:30.958 --> 05:32.159
Yeah, that's right.

05:32.179 --> 05:32.679
That's right.

05:33.400 --> 05:38.665
And see, I think you're sort of right with more conviction

05:43.910 --> 05:45.554
a lot of places I haven't visited, you know.

05:45.614 --> 05:58.226
I mean, I've never, for instance, been to Monticello or to the University of Virginia, you know, the university designed by Jefferson near Charlottesville.

05:58.246 --> 06:00.412
Charlottesville was one of my papers, by the way.

06:00.432 --> 06:00.973
Was I?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.300
My column runs in about 22 papers.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.121
Oh, really?

06:04.201 --> 06:04.722
Oh, my gosh.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.765
And largely University towns.

06:07.025 --> 06:08.307
Yes, yes.

06:08.347 --> 06:09.849
It happens in Charlottesville.

06:09.909 --> 06:10.249
Yeah.

06:10.830 --> 06:19.762
Well, you see, I'd never, although, of course, I'd seen 2,000 photographs of Charlottesville to see it in a photo and to, you know, walk around.

06:19.782 --> 06:21.805
Because Marcello, you're actually small when you see it.

06:21.825 --> 06:22.265
It is.

06:22.646 --> 06:22.986
It is.

06:24.789 --> 06:28.554
I was just thinking of going through the book, that picture of fallen water, for instance.

06:28.574 --> 06:28.834
That's...

06:29.287 --> 06:32.972
I almost wonder if that house was designed just to be seen from that very point.

06:33.193 --> 06:37.278
Well, as a matter of fact, it was designed to be seen.

06:37.579 --> 06:49.756
Well, I don't know which kind, first the chicken or the egg, but the garden is arranged in the Japanese manner where you have a number of, as it were, pre-selected full views of the house from different angles.

06:50.157 --> 06:54.924
But every photo I've ever seen of it always is from that vantage point.

06:54.944 --> 06:55.885
Yeah, well, I guess...

06:56.371 --> 06:57.813
I guess there's a reason for that.

06:57.833 --> 07:01.157
A lot of... Because falling water, you've got to see the water.

07:01.177 --> 07:02.238
Yeah, you've got to see the water.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.642
It must have been an intolerable house to live in during the spring, you know.

07:05.662 --> 07:06.703
That was irrelevant.

07:06.904 --> 07:10.648
It was quite irrelevant as far as Wright was concerned, yeah.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.851
And he covered it?

07:13.211 --> 07:16.395
Well, Wright was not deeply concerned about that.

07:17.757 --> 07:17.957
Yeah.

07:18.764 --> 07:24.110
Would you say that you mentioned Fatal Shore, which was kind of a pay-in to your native country?

07:24.331 --> 07:24.571
Yeah.

07:24.611 --> 07:29.857
In a way, is this a similar kind of... A similar kind of thing to America, except, of course, the subject matter is very different.

07:29.937 --> 07:45.416
I mean, in the case of Fatal Shore, I wanted to excavate the origins of the country, you know, which had been fairly sublimated by Australians, you know, because they were not by any means proud of their penal origins.

07:46.917 --> 07:47.438
But...

07:48.042 --> 07:57.751
Just as, you know, from studying that period, you get to get quite a few clues about what made Australians.

07:58.592 --> 08:14.386
So I think that the basic project of writing this book, which is not so much formal history of American art, but to... I'm getting tired of re-quoting this phrase, but it's actually true, you know, to sort of see what you can tell about Americans and the things they've made.

08:14.466 --> 08:16.648
There is something in common between the two.

08:16.932 --> 08:35.498
Um, but the, the, uh, uh, of course this, you know, I mean, I think of it, I think, I think of this one as a book about America, but the primary evidence is in the art, whereas, uh, uh, Michael Shaw was, you know, about Australia and it really had very little to do with it.

08:35.518 --> 08:36.059
Yeah, it was a narrative.

08:36.079 --> 08:38.101
Yeah, it was a narrative, you know.

08:38.121 --> 08:38.502
This was a

08:41.738 --> 08:48.329
It amazes me that they managed to get it printed at that level of quality as quick as they did.

08:48.349 --> 08:48.930
That's craft.

08:49.251 --> 08:50.012
That's good up for you.

08:50.032 --> 08:51.875
They're wonderful.

08:53.117 --> 08:56.102
They only got one picture for Flott.

08:56.222 --> 08:57.364
Which one is that?

08:57.404 --> 09:01.031
Perhaps I shouldn't tell you.

09:01.591 --> 09:04.877
It was the tumble signing of the Declaration of Independence.

09:06.730 --> 09:07.631
But that's the only one.

09:07.791 --> 09:09.813
I mean, there were a few that were caught at the last moment.

09:10.454 --> 09:13.137
So they go to press again, they'll fix it, right?

09:13.237 --> 09:13.617
Perhaps.

09:13.898 --> 09:14.378
One hopes.

09:14.839 --> 09:15.039
Yeah.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.842
But, you know, there isn't an awful lot to fix.

09:17.882 --> 09:20.605
There have been a few complaints that there's no bibliography.

09:20.625 --> 09:28.374
Well, I have to say that concerns me, too, as opposed to much bibliography and notes.

09:28.754 --> 09:31.557
Well, listen, the...

09:32.110 --> 09:37.094
Perhaps it's because it was written at such speed, but also there are honourable precedents for this.

09:37.114 --> 09:42.039
I mean, Civilisation didn't have a bibliography on that, and neither did... Is this stronger than Civilisation?

09:42.059 --> 09:42.679
Well, I hope so.

09:42.759 --> 09:43.440
I may say so.

09:43.460 --> 09:44.301
I hope so, yeah.

09:44.681 --> 09:45.161
I hope so.

09:45.822 --> 10:00.835
I mean, I may, you know, for the second edition, actually the second printing is already underway, but for the third, whatever, when they republished before Christmas, I had been talking to them about maybe

10:01.355 --> 10:02.536
putting in a bibliography.

10:02.777 --> 10:05.259
That's what bothers you, then, a little bit.

10:05.279 --> 10:08.783
It does bother me a little bit, but not terribly much.

10:08.943 --> 10:12.167
You know, it's not intended as a scholarly book.

10:12.247 --> 10:14.850
Well, you set this out at the very beginning.

10:14.890 --> 10:23.399
You say you're hoping to reach, you know, that mythical creature of the intelligent reader, which may be an oxymoron.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.841
I don't think it is an oxymoron.

10:24.861 --> 10:26.223
I think there are an awful lot on there.

10:26.423 --> 10:29.286
I'm writing a new book, by the way, that does...

10:30.616 --> 10:33.201
have some attention paid to the reader.

10:33.441 --> 10:34.023
Yeah.

10:34.363 --> 10:35.425
Is there such a creature?

10:35.946 --> 10:36.507
Well, let's hope.

10:36.788 --> 10:38.772
Let's hope there are many thousand of them.

10:38.912 --> 10:41.597
Yeah, well, this is a $65 book.

10:41.978 --> 10:42.679
Yes, that's right.

10:42.699 --> 10:44.503
And so how many did they print?

10:44.523 --> 10:45.024
A hundred thousand.

10:45.264 --> 10:45.665
Jesus.

10:46.807 --> 10:51.756
But see, I mean, I don't think they print as many as a hundred thousand if there wasn't the television series coming out.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.620
But nevertheless, that's

10:55.895 --> 10:58.040
They're confident about it.

10:58.321 --> 10:59.142
Yeah.

10:59.182 --> 11:06.138
Well, you know, if that confidence is mistraced, then there's going to be an awful lot of trees that died in vain.

11:07.381 --> 11:09.867
That's the way it goes, you know.

11:10.649 --> 11:13.515
I have no idea what 100,000 copies of this thing weigh.

11:15.655 --> 11:16.796
How much does this weigh?

11:17.757 --> 11:18.098
How much is it?

11:18.138 --> 11:18.998
About six pounds.

11:19.199 --> 11:19.999
About six pounds.

11:20.019 --> 11:24.804
So 600,000 pounds divided by 2240, whatever that is.

11:25.005 --> 11:28.228
That's 60,000.

11:28.929 --> 11:35.736
Well, these books will... I don't foresee these books becoming insulation at any time soon.

11:35.756 --> 11:36.997
I don't think so.

11:37.017 --> 11:38.779
No, I think it's going to have a long shelf life.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.442
I mean, my books tend not to go out of print.

11:41.822 --> 11:44.785
I leave my old history of Australian art, which I read when I was 26.

11:45.187 --> 11:45.968
or something.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.114
Still in print, yeah.

11:49.194 --> 11:52.740
After 30 years, yeah.

11:52.800 --> 12:00.513
One of the things you point out is that we tend to think, we Americans, that we're a young, evolving nation.

12:00.533 --> 12:03.718
You're an evolving nation, but not a young one.

12:04.643 --> 12:05.344
I mean, St.

12:05.364 --> 12:07.607
Petersburg is younger, you say, than Boston.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.490
Yeah, it is, yeah.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.573
I mean, Boston's been around for a long time.

12:11.593 --> 12:12.614
Well, that knocked me over.

12:12.634 --> 12:13.255
I'm going to St.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.319
Petersburg for this new book that I'm playing, as Jesus said.

12:17.060 --> 12:20.325
Boston is, that's right, it makes... It's true.

12:20.545 --> 12:21.747
Absolutely true.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.449
I mean, it's the world's oldest democracy.

12:24.190 --> 12:29.798
It's the world's, in other words, it's the world's oldest continuous practitioner of that form.

12:29.818 --> 12:32.642
And the...

12:33.230 --> 12:48.009
You know, the American Revolution well predated the French Revolution, although for some reason, I think partly because of this, you know, sort of idea that Americans have about perpetual renewal, you know, it's still faintly surprising to find that the French Revolution didn't come first.

12:48.690 --> 12:51.153
And this is the classic revolution, of course.

12:51.253 --> 12:52.715
It always makes no sense.

12:52.795 --> 12:54.797
I mean, it's a revolution started by rich men.

12:54.877 --> 12:56.900
I mean, that doesn't... Well, that's not necessary.

12:56.920 --> 13:00.925
You know, I mean, the French Revolution was, to a great extent, instigated by the bourgeoisie, too.

13:01.327 --> 13:11.222
I mean, read Simon Sharma's book on the subject, which caused so much annoyance among certain Marxist critics that it came out of, you know, in 1989's Citizens.

13:12.564 --> 13:24.583
But the, I don't know, I mean, the thing is that, you know, I mean, part of the, actually the greatness of the American Revolution was that it didn't,

13:26.622 --> 13:31.047
plunge this country into Jacobin bloodbaths and so forth.

13:31.087 --> 13:32.449
It functioned far.

13:32.469 --> 13:35.913
I mean, you don't have to have a lot of bloodshed in order to have a revolution.

13:35.953 --> 13:38.857
Well, that's absolutely the case.

13:41.560 --> 13:49.270
You mentioned earlier, at the very beginning, that So-and-so's book has the, gives off the aura of being a lecture.

13:49.830 --> 13:56.038
But I have to say, I have to say that there are moments in the world where I feel this is, that this does...

13:56.609 --> 13:58.291
Well, you can't help it.

13:58.311 --> 14:00.473
It's a very entertaining lecture.

14:00.493 --> 14:03.656
Yeah, but I'd like it to be entertaining, as indeed Clark's was, too.

14:03.997 --> 14:11.465
You know, sort of different generations, different styles and so on.

14:11.485 --> 14:17.511
I mean, you give us our little nuggets, you know, Homer is the greatest American painter of the 19th century.

14:17.531 --> 14:20.334
I love that one about the room with the soil in it.

14:20.354 --> 14:22.576
It doesn't do it justice to reproduce.

14:22.617 --> 14:24.979
It doesn't do it justice to visit it.

14:28.638 --> 14:29.579
Wally de Maria.

14:29.980 --> 14:34.386
And yet, you know, de Maria's lightning field is on the cover of the book.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.048
I think it's fantastic, these lightning fields.

14:37.350 --> 14:45.501
But there's a kind of, you know, dogged dedication that you get in the perpetuation of that thing.

14:45.521 --> 14:48.165
Well, you know, the Dear Foundation was very nice.

14:48.185 --> 14:51.089
It just said we'll maintain it indefinitely.

14:51.109 --> 14:53.733
Periodically, I guess they hop in and weed it or something.

14:53.753 --> 14:57.598
But, I mean, when you see something like that,

14:58.439 --> 15:14.659
purporting itself to be a piece of art there's no purporting it is a piece of art this is our business of whether something purports to be a piece of art or not is a redheading because you know a row of bricks on the museum floor

15:15.432 --> 15:17.795
if it's designated as a work of art, is a work of art.

15:18.136 --> 15:25.986
The same row of bricks in the parking lot outside where it doesn't have the art context to identify it is a row of fucking bricks, you know.

15:26.206 --> 15:26.827
Sidewalk.

15:26.847 --> 15:28.008
Yeah, right.

15:28.429 --> 15:29.811
Well, so what makes it a work of art?

15:29.831 --> 15:31.032
Because somebody says it so?

15:31.373 --> 15:40.805
Yeah, I mean, all I'm arguing is that to say that something is a work of art is not automatically placed in a higher moral or conceptual category than other things in this world.

15:40.945 --> 15:43.228
It just shifts along the question of whether it's

15:47.967 --> 15:51.771
the product of human expression, I guess?

15:52.012 --> 15:55.596
The product of human expression, which is clearly labeled as being such.

15:56.297 --> 16:01.583
Either by its context, it doesn't mean, it doesn't say anything about whether it's great or lousy.

16:02.424 --> 16:05.667
You know, it's like saying, this is a test tube, or this is a rubber ball.

16:06.348 --> 16:08.430
So is this kind of a guiding tenet of yours?

16:09.291 --> 16:17.721
Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's the only, you know, sort of step one to making some kind of sense of, look, I remember when I was a kid,

16:18.106 --> 16:33.302
The first time that I ever got annoyed by a work of art, and I didn't see very many, because one didn't, playing up in a Jesuit boarding school in Sydney, Australia.

16:33.942 --> 16:47.016
But I remember going in 1953, one time it would have been about 15, there was an exhibition of modern European painting at the New South Wales Art Gallery, which is the main museum in Sydney, and one of the things in there was a painting which

16:47.570 --> 16:51.700
oddly enough, belongs to a guy I know in New York now, by Joan Miron.

16:52.803 --> 16:57.394
And it looked totally and absolutely wacky to me.

16:57.454 --> 16:58.898
It looked like an insult to the eye.

16:58.978 --> 17:03.148
I mean, he was the square of burlap with the number 49 painted on it in

17:10.975 --> 17:13.278
And there were a couple of red blobs.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.442
And, you know, it didn't make any rhyme or reason to me.

17:16.462 --> 17:25.074
And I remember looking at it and deeply felt contempt, saying to myself, well, that is not a work of art.

17:26.496 --> 17:30.702
And then I thought, well, if that isn't a work of art, what is a work of art?

17:30.742 --> 17:40.695
And I guess my sort of embryonic thoughts as a future critic started from that point.

17:41.232 --> 17:55.277
You know, to go back earlier to what we say about America not being as old as we might, or as young as we might think, it is the only country of any significant size that is blackened entirely by print, isn't it?

17:55.297 --> 17:55.617
Yeah.

17:55.637 --> 17:58.442
I mean, Columbus announced it's just in print.

17:58.622 --> 17:59.023
That's right.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.726
So when you think the whole experience,

18:01.246 --> 18:01.927
Yes.

18:02.808 --> 18:04.570
We've been able to examine it, haven't we?

18:05.211 --> 18:05.611
That's right.

18:05.631 --> 18:07.113
And so that is very interesting, isn't it?

18:07.133 --> 18:09.236
And, of course, you know... It's been documented.

18:09.256 --> 18:09.937
You're exactly right.

18:09.957 --> 18:20.230
Not only has it been documented, but, you know, it has been the subject of innumerable replicated and, you know, repeated and disseminated fantasies.

18:23.314 --> 18:30.122
You know, which were much more widely disseminated about America than were about, you know, countries that were, quote, discovered earlier.

18:30.777 --> 18:44.051
And, you know, I mean, part of the European image of America from that day to this has a great deal to do with fantasy, you know, and the... Especially the Indians and the wild west and... Yeah, all that stuff.

18:44.071 --> 18:45.973
Well, of course, that appealed to Americans too.

18:46.593 --> 18:50.558
And, you know, somewhere in the middle of these fantasies, there are cause of truth.

18:50.658 --> 18:56.944
I mean, it is true that there was a wild west and that it once was wild and that, you know, if it was full of Indians, it would have given a very shabby deal.

18:57.325 --> 19:00.548
But see, the...

19:00.798 --> 19:21.514
I think I reproduced somewhere in the book that picture of an artist called Shreveogel painting a western cowboy in his hat pointing a gun at the Shreveogel and he's kneeling on the roof of Shreveogel's studio in Hoboken, New Jersey.

19:21.534 --> 19:24.038
And yet people were quite just as prepared to accept

19:24.473 --> 19:49.368
these late, you know, 19th, early 20th century paintings as a faithful record of life on the western frontier as, you know, they had been earlier to accept, say, debris engravings of cannibal savages of the Caribbean as a faithful record of Amerindian life in the 1540s.

19:49.729 --> 19:51.932
But because

19:56.148 --> 20:01.773
from the standpoint of a critic and historian, you really can't see it whole, can't you?

20:02.734 --> 20:08.940
Well, one would like to try and see it whole, but it's such a vast subject that you can only see it through a particular porthole.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.241
Well, you can track the arc.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.383
Yeah.

20:12.423 --> 20:25.615
I think what you can do is make, you know, make a sort of, in some respects, a parallel narrative, which doesn't work in all cases, which sort of

20:25.983 --> 20:44.786
functions okay between events in American society and events in, you know, for want of a better word, you'd call the American psyche, and the art that these reflect, or the art that reflects them.

20:45.627 --> 20:52.035
I mean, all art is socially grounded, you know, to greater or lesser degrees, and all sorts of stuff seeps into their pictures.

20:52.095 --> 20:54.758
I mean, you wouldn't necessarily have had

20:55.362 --> 21:22.633
that demand for those huge sort of god-struck, optimistic paintings of Western wilderness by Bierstadt and others in the 1860s, if it hadn't been for the great drive of the white man's westward expansion or indeed for that social myth of manifest destiny.

21:22.653 --> 21:24.475
These do connect.

21:24.657 --> 21:31.668
Did you bring any, oh, obviously you brought a degree of baggage to the project.

21:31.688 --> 21:33.671
Well, nobody starts writing as a version.

21:33.731 --> 21:44.148
Obviously, but you wouldn't describe it either as a work of field research and that you're allowed to make this.

21:44.168 --> 21:46.632
No, it's written mainly from secondary sources.

21:47.135 --> 22:12.298
and uh the the you know all the stuff but but but but you have an opinion of certainly the original research if you wish to call it that is you know what i've conducted with me and i over the over the last nearly 30 years i've been living in america but the the i didn't do any original but it is just a relation of attitudes and opinions that they were formed prior to the to doing the project oh absolutely yes but also ones which were formed during

22:17.543 --> 22:19.905
Were there surprises for you?

22:21.607 --> 22:24.149
Yeah, there were surprises as to quality.

22:24.169 --> 22:27.572
I mean, there are quite a number of those.

22:27.632 --> 22:37.842
I mean, for instance, I went into the project not realising what a really good painter, for instance, John Singer Sargent was.

22:37.882 --> 22:43.387
I thought, you know, I tended to share this view that many people had of him that he was a rather slick social portraitist.

22:44.968 --> 22:45.629
I don't think that.

22:45.749 --> 22:47.010
I mean, he was sometimes a slick

22:50.197 --> 23:16.744
remarkably good painter the main thing that although I guess this was part of my original idea for the thing but it certainly strengthened with you know as the project went along was to point out you know like when I started working as a critic in America there was a sort of general feeling diffused throughout the art world which in turn diffused it to the public that

23:17.129 --> 23:24.819
pre-20th century or even pre-World War II American art wasn't as interesting as what happened after.

23:24.879 --> 23:30.786
In other words, that American art really achieved a kind of maturity with abstract expressions in which it hadn't possessed before.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.770
This was the point at which American art became original.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.353
You didn't hold that view.

23:36.373 --> 23:45.364
I didn't hold that view, but nevertheless I was affected by it, and gradually I sort of began to think, well, this actually has to be argued against.

23:46.087 --> 24:02.986
And the... I mean, you must remember that this, you know, the early 70s, at the time when, for instance, the Whitney Museum was selling off its holdings of 19th century American art because they weren't interested in that part of the story, you know.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.288
Amazing, huh?

24:04.308 --> 24:06.991
You know, they were selling their churches and stuff.

24:07.011 --> 24:08.793
They only sell homeless, too.

24:08.813 --> 24:09.474
For all I know.

24:09.995 --> 24:10.896
For all I know.

24:11.136 --> 24:12.618
For all I know.

24:12.638 --> 24:14.760
And the...

24:16.478 --> 24:21.224
You know, I mean, Frederick Church in the early 70s was a total drug on the market.

24:21.244 --> 24:29.895
You know, there were just these big pictures of, you know, mountains and cascades and things, and they were rather dirty and nobody bothered to look at them.

24:29.915 --> 24:43.972
I mean, you know, that big one of his icebergs that made the world record price, I can't remember when, I think at the end of the 70s, was found in the hall of an orphanage in London, you know, and they had the fondest idea of what it was.

24:45.294 --> 24:46.215
The...

24:46.668 --> 24:54.680
To this day, there are still, I think, really exceptionally good American artists who are, in comparison to others, considerably underrated.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.605
I mean, Stuart Davis is an example.

24:57.625 --> 25:08.541
Stuart Davis's reputation, it didn't get blotted out by any means, but it was distinctly occluded by post-war abstract expressionism, you know, for every...

25:12.436 --> 25:20.986
I mean, for every hundred articles that you got on Bill de Kooning in the mid-1970s, you might have seen maybe one on Davis.

25:22.007 --> 25:30.177
And yet he was a really extraordinarily interesting and vigorous and gifted American painter.

25:30.577 --> 25:39.608
Anyway, so I wanted to argue as clearly as I could for a general audience that

25:40.364 --> 25:43.108
First of all, there are long contiguities in American art.

25:43.669 --> 25:54.825
And secondly, right from the time of Copley on, it produced altogether remarkable figures.

25:55.126 --> 26:01.175
I mean, not a huge number of them, but enough to make the trip really worthwhile.

26:01.595 --> 26:06.002
Are there any areas where American art really excels?

26:06.403 --> 26:08.025
I mean, I know you talk about skyscrapers,

26:13.523 --> 26:25.816
Well, you know, if that question means does the, you know, is there one American painter in the 19th century who holds his own or the great ones?

26:25.836 --> 26:28.019
Oh, I think there are quite a few that hold their own.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.664
Well, there are at least a couple who hold their own, namely Aikens and Homer.

26:33.585 --> 26:40.392
And Audubon, if you wish to regard him as a 19th century, well, I mean, he is.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.075
But, you know, did America...

26:43.713 --> 27:13.062
artists of the stature and range of say Delacroix or Ingres or Manet probably not but within his area which is that of a very exacting tough-minded realism there were no French painters who were better than Winslow Homer or

27:13.582 --> 27:18.812
especially Aitken's, really not, I don't think.

27:19.494 --> 27:21.678
How does something like Mary Cassatt fit in?

27:21.698 --> 27:32.660
Well, you see, Mary Cassatt fits in there very well, because after all, she was the one and only American painter who was completely accepted by the French avant-garde of her time.

27:33.522 --> 27:35.185
I mean, admittedly, she came to...

27:35.519 --> 27:42.552
to Paris just a tad late for the origins of Impressionism, but the fact was that she exhibited with the Impressionists.

27:42.572 --> 27:47.861
She was taken with perfect seriousness by them as, you know, an equal, as a colleague.

27:48.382 --> 27:50.126
You know, Degas.

27:50.767 --> 27:52.810
Did it help that she was a she?

27:52.830 --> 27:54.053
It didn't matter that she was a she.

27:54.073 --> 27:58.641
I mean, the thing is that late 19th century Paris was a good deal less

27:58.958 --> 28:06.978
uh, sexually biased with regard to women painters than, um, uh, mid 20th century in New York.

28:06.998 --> 28:16.140
And, uh, the, the, you know, because that whole sort of, uh, you know, primitive notion of machismo and genius didn't really, you know, affect

28:16.559 --> 28:18.081
the French so much.

28:18.462 --> 28:30.818
Well, I like the fact that you... I mean, you know, they had this terrific, you know, this strong regard, for instance, for Rosa Bonheur, who was now not, you know, sort of regarded on the same plane as Cassatt, although, you know, certainly not by me.

28:31.359 --> 28:36.166
But, nevertheless, Bonheur was a big picture of the cellars.

28:37.488 --> 28:37.808
Ah.

28:40.049 --> 28:41.911
Anything else?

28:42.151 --> 28:45.134
Well, they're doing something a little strange this week.

28:45.155 --> 28:46.736
There's a whole special issue of time.

28:47.277 --> 28:47.757
I'll show you.

28:48.838 --> 28:50.120
Certainly Newsweek did a nice thing.

28:50.160 --> 28:50.921
Yeah, I did.

28:50.961 --> 28:52.823
This is 75 pages.

28:52.863 --> 28:53.544
Oh, Jesus.

28:55.666 --> 28:56.206
Wow.

28:57.228 --> 28:59.830
I had to write that whole damn thing.

28:59.850 --> 29:00.671
That's wonderful.

29:00.831 --> 29:01.893
This will be out this week?

29:01.913 --> 29:02.773
This will be out this week.

29:04.035 --> 29:04.696
Excellent.

29:05.456 --> 29:06.057
Where were we?

29:07.336 --> 29:09.058
Rosa Bonheur.

29:10.100 --> 29:17.831
There were quite a number of 19th century French artists who were highly regarded by the French themselves.

29:18.292 --> 29:20.155
I mean, women artists.

29:20.695 --> 29:37.039
The prejudice against women artists is actually much more, I think, an artifact of the 20th and of the 19th century.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.370
Well, it works both ways, too.

29:39.811 --> 29:46.557
I'm pleased that you, you know, discussed Georgia O'Keeffe, for instance, with the history of...

29:46.942 --> 30:11.768
openness you know some of the stuff is really some of the stuff is it sucks it sucks it's right i agree with you sometimes it's sometimes it is you know difficult to deal head on with people who have been made into feminist icons for reasons other than the quality we see this in writing you see yeah and you know we have to accept a book

30:12.187 --> 30:15.011
It's trouble, but... What do you mean?

30:15.031 --> 30:18.116
You're not talking about Maya Angelou, by the chance, are you?

30:18.136 --> 30:20.920
I don't read Maya Angelou, but I'm including her.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.743
Yeah, actually, I am.

30:22.883 --> 30:27.970
In fact, Maya Angelou, to be frank, is the black female Rob McEwan.

30:28.110 --> 30:37.384
That's... But, you know, nobody says so, because then they think that you, I'm sure she does, but, you know, nobody seems prepared to say so, because...

30:37.887 --> 30:41.371
You know, it's thought to be racist and anti-feminist to say so.

30:41.591 --> 30:42.933
But, of course, it's neither of these things.

30:42.953 --> 30:50.061
There's a book that I published last year called Push by this woman named Sapphire, a novel.

30:50.081 --> 30:52.564
And try and whack that book.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.087
Yeah, but also there are a lot of unreadable books by men, too.

30:55.468 --> 30:57.150
I mean, the thing is, I think... I understand.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.071
Yeah.

30:58.111 --> 30:59.673
Probably more, actually.

30:59.753 --> 31:01.895
Yeah, well, probably.

31:01.956 --> 31:07.422
But you're at your own risk, you know, when you... But you see, the thing is, you know...

31:07.739 --> 31:14.430
There is a level of political correctness, a degree of political correctness that does enter art as well as it does with literature.

31:14.811 --> 31:23.466
Well, I think in a way, in some respects, it enters art even more than it does literature, at least in terms of the reception of the artists.

31:24.087 --> 31:30.397
It is a myth that when artists are now discriminated against by the art world, it is simply and flatly a myth.

31:31.239 --> 31:33.122
And the...

31:33.625 --> 31:40.332
In the same way, I mean, nobody in his right mind would assert that women writers are discriminated against by the publishing world.

31:40.352 --> 31:41.673
They are simply not.

31:41.693 --> 31:44.456
No, I think actually they get the better of the breaks.

31:44.476 --> 31:45.818
I don't think they get the better of the breaks.

31:45.878 --> 31:47.339
I don't think they get the worse of the breaks.

31:47.359 --> 31:56.889
It's just that nobody that I know of or that I've heard of has any a priori discrimination against women writers as women.

31:57.730 --> 31:58.671
Well, especially since...

32:01.317 --> 32:08.125
The publishing industry is basically run... Well, it's not basically run by women, but it's to some extent run by women.

32:08.145 --> 32:08.866
I mean, they're in there.

32:08.886 --> 32:17.235
There are an awful lot of women editors, including some really great ones, like Elizabeth Sifton, whom I had the pleasure to work with once.

32:17.916 --> 32:26.346
And nobody is going to think that a book has less market chance...

32:27.136 --> 32:30.539
because it's by a woman than it does, you know, because it's by a man.

32:30.579 --> 32:34.042
I'm surprised by women who tend to buy more novels, though.

32:34.242 --> 32:35.684
Well, that may be so.

32:35.724 --> 32:38.787
Those are marketing decisions, not necessarily artistic ones.

32:38.807 --> 32:41.929
Well, yes, but also, you know, the artistic decisions are taken.

32:41.969 --> 32:49.797
And, you know, I'm extremely glad that there is no such discrimination in the publishing world, even if there once was.

32:49.877 --> 32:52.599
I don't know whether there was or not, but there certainly isn't now.

32:53.100 --> 32:56.923
And in the same way, the, you know, the art market

32:57.308 --> 33:25.442
you know is not going to have any hesitation about giving a woman artist a show but what is I think incontestably true is that the art market is now so overloaded there are so many artists out there that it is correspondingly easy for an overlooked or unsuccessful woman painter who may indeed be

33:25.945 --> 33:36.349
overlooked for just as valid reasons as so many male painters are overlooked, to say, well, this is the result of sexism and, you know, I've hit the glass ceiling and that sort of thing.

33:36.369 --> 33:39.617
But I really don't see much evidence of this.

33:51.916 --> 34:01.452
Well, so it is argued by some people that the, the, the, um, uh, yeah, there was because the French gave us the Statue of Liberty.

34:01.512 --> 34:05.158
It wasn't because the French gave us the Statue of Liberty.

34:05.939 --> 34:10.026
But there was that time that the, the, the, um, you know, there was a strong...

34:10.242 --> 34:18.674
movement towards a kind of genteeling of American culture, you know, in the name of what I guess we would now call family values.

34:18.694 --> 34:34.917
And, you know, that is one of the things that provoked the masculinist reaction embodied by writers like Norris and London, and also, you know, as embodied by...

34:35.403 --> 34:38.627
The Ashcan School, you know, particularly by Bellows.

34:39.167 --> 34:45.074
I mean, you know, these things were naturally all linked, you know.

34:46.876 --> 35:03.874
But, you see, I think that it's more productive if you're looking at a hyper-masculinist artist like Bellows to take him on his own terms rather than to say, ah, here he is painting phallocratic scenes of male conflict.

35:04.242 --> 35:21.476
how wicked and how, you know, improperly this diverts attention from, you know, women artists like Celia Faxter or, you know... I have four... I mean, all the school of genteel lady Impressionists, many of them in Boston.

35:22.197 --> 35:26.065
I mean, you know... Well...

35:26.568 --> 35:29.011
I've often thought of writing in... I find much of it very boring.

35:29.231 --> 35:30.312
Well, I see.

35:30.412 --> 35:34.136
I actually collect Cedar because she's so quaint and dated.

35:34.156 --> 35:34.777
Yes.

35:34.797 --> 35:40.704
And really, I collect it because I have the Island Garden book in first edition with this wonderful child.

35:40.724 --> 35:42.686
Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:43.346 --> 35:44.548
That you have in here.

35:44.568 --> 35:47.391
Oh, well, that's a collector's item.

35:47.511 --> 35:49.453
I have four of them, actually.

35:49.533 --> 35:51.435
Oh, really?

35:51.475 --> 35:55.680
I'm a book guy, and I've... Winslow Homer is a great, great...

35:56.335 --> 36:01.304
I have just about all of his, not all, but certainly all of his Harper's Weekly.

36:01.324 --> 36:02.025
Oh, really?

36:02.045 --> 36:02.506
Yeah.

36:02.526 --> 36:04.689
Most of the ones, all the great ones.

36:05.150 --> 36:09.538
And you really don't get into the graphic art that much of Homer in this book.

36:09.558 --> 36:09.918
No, I don't.

36:10.319 --> 36:12.142
But you have a limited amount of space, you see.

36:12.162 --> 36:14.727
Because it was so, he was the guy.

36:14.747 --> 36:15.488
He was the guy.

36:15.508 --> 36:15.789
Yeah.

36:15.989 --> 36:17.812
No, no, he was a very gifted graphic reporter.

36:17.872 --> 36:18.934
It's absolutely true.

36:19.370 --> 36:43.302
but the um in fact i think the only graphic artist with whom i deal in any length is probably charles dana gibson but you see the history of american graphic art press cartooning and so on and so forth overflowing into the comic strip and into popular art is an enormous subject it's a whole other field it's like photography i couldn't really do justice to photography i mean i had to you know limit my cone of

36:43.872 --> 36:47.558
vision of it because... It's important to point out, I think.

36:47.699 --> 36:48.019
Yeah.

36:48.240 --> 36:54.050
You really didn't do the whole... You really were unable to... Well, how can you fit it all in one book?

36:54.611 --> 36:58.858
I mean, such a book would degenerate really into a kind of telephone directory.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.503
And people don't want to read telephone directories.

37:01.523 --> 37:02.825
And you have to maintain your focus.

37:02.985 --> 37:04.067
You have to maintain your focus.

37:04.087 --> 37:05.610
You have to keep the story tracking.

37:06.029 --> 37:19.433
and just say, look, I'm sorry, there are some things I can't handle, you know, in the same way as, you know, I severely delimited the role that Native American art, Indian art, plays in the book.

37:19.453 --> 37:26.265
I restricted it to the extent to which, to give you examples, the extent to which it had influenced

37:26.819 --> 37:31.793
white European culture in America because I'm not an anthropologist.

37:32.214 --> 37:41.841
I don't have sufficient background or training in that highly specialized and rather contested domain.

37:41.821 --> 37:47.631
I thought it was better just to make it plain than to, you know, go into it and give a, you know, a like one thing.

37:47.691 --> 37:51.457
You do touch on this ephemeral art, like the spiral jetty.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.359
Yeah, yeah.

37:52.379 --> 37:53.741
But it wasn't meant to be ephemeral.

37:54.222 --> 37:55.584
It was meant to stay there forever.

37:56.045 --> 37:59.370
It's just that the lake had other views.

37:59.390 --> 38:04.078
But sandcastles, you know, scare clothes, these kind of things are ephemeral things.

38:04.118 --> 38:04.880
Yeah, sure.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.883
But being ephemeral doesn't mean it's not art.

38:07.538 --> 38:10.462
You know, it can be terrific.

38:10.482 --> 38:16.629
I mean, after all, there are lots of Titians and Rembrandts that turned out to be ephemeral in, you know, between 1939 and 1945.

38:16.669 --> 38:19.653
They just weren't very proof against burning phosphorus.

38:19.973 --> 38:22.537
So do you think you have another huge project like this?

38:22.577 --> 38:23.738
Not for the moment, Madonna.

38:23.778 --> 38:24.599
What do you think I am?

38:24.659 --> 38:25.781
No, absolutely not.

38:25.821 --> 38:28.464
I'm going to, you know, just relax.

38:28.504 --> 38:36.234
I mean, you know, doing the tour has been fairly taxing, let alone, you know, doing the television series and the book and all that stuff.

38:36.254 --> 38:37.275
I...

38:37.913 --> 38:48.410
No, I just want to get the promotion out of the way, see the series onto air in America.

38:48.430 --> 38:49.632
It's coming up shortly, isn't it?

38:49.652 --> 38:52.337
It's coming up actually next week on the 28th.

38:52.397 --> 38:57.305
I'm going to hustle and get this out, get this story out.

38:58.126 --> 39:02.433
Yeah, it goes to air on the 28th.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.056
They're broadcasting it.

39:04.812 --> 39:11.298
in four blocks of two programs each, between 9 and 11 on Wednesday nights.

39:11.318 --> 39:21.608
And it will... So I guess it'll be the 28th and the 4th of June, then the 11th, then the 18th, and that's it.

39:21.649 --> 39:23.831
And then presumably they'll replay it.

39:24.631 --> 39:27.694
But see, it's been up in Australia already and in England.

39:28.035 --> 39:28.475
They liked it.

39:28.856 --> 39:29.616
Oh, they loved it, yeah.

39:30.097 --> 39:30.297
Yeah.

39:30.563 --> 39:31.204
How about the book?

39:31.224 --> 39:32.246
Was it available?

39:32.266 --> 39:34.590
No, no, the book is new.

39:34.670 --> 39:41.543
That hasn't been out there, and the reason why I'm going to Australia in June is partly to promote it in Australia, but just for a week, you know.

39:43.066 --> 39:46.973
Anything I haven't covered that you think... Jesus, I don't know.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.798
I haven't asked you specific questions that I can get out of the book.

39:49.818 --> 39:50.619
That's my job.

39:50.639 --> 39:51.381
Yeah, that's your job.

39:51.661 --> 39:52.723
I believe that.

39:53.277 --> 39:55.861
I was looking for some good quotes, I think.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.264
Nor at this point could I remember everything that's in the book.

39:58.565 --> 40:00.868
It's funny, you know, it's like detox.

40:00.948 --> 40:06.296
I mean, the thing was written with such intensity and, you know, under such pressure.

40:06.537 --> 40:08.339
We're talking about women, though.

40:08.359 --> 40:11.123
Who did women better than Winslow Homer, especially in that?

40:11.143 --> 40:15.770
That's why I guess I brought up the graphic art, those wonderful girls.

40:16.031 --> 40:18.574
Oh, some of the color coach girls are just terrific, aren't they?

40:18.935 --> 40:22.440
You see, he was the great, you know,

40:22.741 --> 40:36.020
reasonably unsentimental recorder of American childhood in an age which was incredibly sentimental about, you know, children, virgins, and, you know, ideal, pure, you know, bonnie Massachusetts damsels.

40:38.984 --> 40:46.455
I mean, nobody could call Homer's eye a particularly, you know, investigatory one, except that it was formally investigatory.

40:46.475 --> 40:50.501
But the, you know, that was why he was so popular.

40:50.521 --> 40:51.803
But he did tell stories, though.

40:52.238 --> 40:53.580
He tells stories.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.202
He was a very, very good narrative painter.

40:56.063 --> 41:00.149
And not all of them are accountable for just in terms of a simple story.

41:00.169 --> 41:01.371
There's a lot of mystery in Homer.

41:01.391 --> 41:06.458
There's a lot of... You know, he's a much deeper painter than people tend to think.

41:06.478 --> 41:07.880
Well, you point that out in the book.

41:07.900 --> 41:12.907
See, when I... Some of the artists of the sea, which is, you know... Which is true.

41:12.968 --> 41:15.772
There were other depths.

41:15.812 --> 41:16.993
Yeah, there certainly were.

41:17.033 --> 41:20.338
And the...

41:20.318 --> 41:49.870
yeah I mean he was the I think the best sea painter practically since Turner and see it's amazing I mean like when I I mean I remember having a conversation when I first arrived in New York in 1970 with this dealer and I said well you know name me some of your favourite American painters and I said well you know blah blah blah blah and Winslow Homer and he looked at me as though oh mad you know he just thought that Homer was the sort of fish illustrator

41:51.605 --> 41:52.566
You know, it's like Audubon.

41:52.646 --> 41:55.971
I mean, Audubon wasn't just a great ornithological artist.

41:55.991 --> 41:59.335
He was a great formal artist, and to core.

41:59.355 --> 42:06.504
I just saw up at Dartmouth, I gave a talk up there last week, and they had four of the five volumes of Audubon.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.626
Of the Birds of America, yeah.

42:07.646 --> 42:10.169
And the fifth they didn't get because Homer stiffed Audubon.

42:10.209 --> 42:10.930
He didn't pay.

42:11.230 --> 42:13.052
So he held back the last one.

42:13.072 --> 42:13.512
Oh, really?

42:13.873 --> 42:15.034
Yeah, I tell that in my book.

42:15.054 --> 42:16.856
It's a great story.

42:17.497 --> 42:19.319
Now Dartmouth only has four out of them.

42:19.339 --> 42:20.120
Oh, shit.

42:20.140 --> 42:22.562
Yeah, it's a great story because he wouldn't pay.

42:22.582 --> 42:26.366
Dartmouth kept sending him bills, and he said, fuck you, I'm not sending you the fifth book.

42:26.647 --> 42:27.147
Oh, my God.

42:28.909 --> 42:31.292
Actually, it was Daniel Webster who was buying them.

42:31.392 --> 42:32.934
These were Daniel Webster's books.

42:32.954 --> 42:35.556
Yes, it sounds more like Daniel Webster's period.

42:35.577 --> 42:37.879
Then actually they went to the Haverhill Public Library.

42:40.492 --> 42:43.456
Funny, funny story.

42:44.037 --> 42:46.300
I'm not going to take up too much more of your time.

42:46.961 --> 42:47.963
You're welcome to if you wish.

42:48.423 --> 42:50.486
Although I think I have a phone coming at some point.

42:50.506 --> 42:51.067
I'm not sure.

42:51.888 --> 42:53.350
You've got your little computer there.

42:53.911 --> 42:55.213
I've got my little computer there.

42:55.253 --> 42:56.655
You have a place out on the Hamptons?

42:56.735 --> 42:57.176
Is that right?

42:57.196 --> 42:57.837
Not in the Hamptons.

42:57.857 --> 42:58.818
It's on Shelter Island.

42:58.838 --> 43:00.280
There's a big difference.

43:00.781 --> 43:02.183
The Hamptons is really expensive.

43:02.203 --> 43:03.565
Shelter Island is sort of redneck-y.

43:04.126 --> 43:05.748
You should be able to get out there now.

43:06.249 --> 43:07.731
One of the papers that I sell to

43:10.732 --> 43:32.537
piece oh yeah right so yeah no i live on shelter i don't always have at least i have for the last 15 years or so and uh the the i keep a place in you in new york city but um you're down in soho right so yeah yeah stephen j gold who has a place no i don't i mean i've met google but i don't really know he has a he has a place there's a lot there

43:32.990 --> 43:36.936
I mean, I got that loft in 1970 when they didn't cost anything.

43:36.956 --> 43:38.599
I don't think I could afford to get one.

43:38.619 --> 43:40.542
We called them cast-iron buildings.

43:40.902 --> 43:43.146
Well, we called them cast-iron buildings.

43:43.426 --> 43:44.848
But Soho wasn't Soho.

43:44.908 --> 43:49.195
I mean, Soho wasn't called Soho until, you know, sort of the mid-'70s, really.

43:49.535 --> 43:53.221
Then it was just a kind of downtown industrial wasteland.

43:53.341 --> 43:58.329
I mean, who ever thought of cast-iron building as being an expression, an artistic expression?

43:58.409 --> 43:59.410
But we do now, don't we?

43:59.451 --> 44:00.432
Of course we do.

44:00.412 --> 44:03.755
And as a matter of fact, its manufacturers also did.

44:03.955 --> 44:05.877
Yeah, absolutely.

44:05.897 --> 44:22.413
I mean, for instance, the Hogwarts building, which is on the corner of Broadway and, I think, Broome, designed by Daniel Badger and built in, whenever it was, the 1850-something, 57.

44:23.434 --> 44:25.496
You know, it's very consciously artistic.

44:25.596 --> 44:29.980
It was the first American building to

44:31.765 --> 44:39.987
elevators in it so that they could get up you know and you point out quite correctly that was the key that was the key yeah having elevators then that meant that

44:40.253 --> 44:42.956
you know, Mr. Moneybags could get up to his place of work.

44:43.156 --> 44:45.439
And enable the 23rd floor.

44:45.479 --> 44:46.400
That's right, exactly.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.364
But see, the Warburg building was very consciously designed as an artistic event.

44:50.384 --> 45:04.159
I mean, it copied the window patterns and column rhythms and some of the detailing of Sansovino's Liberia Vecchia in Venice.

45:04.599 --> 45:08.944
Oh, no, there was never not... I mean, those buildings were not

45:09.532 --> 45:11.836
They were utilitarian, but not purely so.

45:12.837 --> 45:14.680
And this, too, is a vein that goes through.

45:14.720 --> 45:24.055
I mean, the thing is that American utilitarian architects have, you know, sometimes had a real genius for all of it.

45:24.075 --> 45:37.716
I mean, people talk about, you know, it was a favorite tenet of later modernists that the great Louis Sullivan...

45:38.422 --> 46:01.587
you know, with his form follows function, Dick Dar, you know, was the predecessor of completely unornamented bare glass architecture in America, but the truth of the matter was that he was one of the greatest ornamental detailers that's ever lived, you know, so that, you know, when you look at something like the Carson Peary Scott store in Chicago, you get both bones and skin.

46:01.607 --> 46:07.213
I mean, there's fabulous decoration on the lower part of it, and it enlivens the whole thing, but also...

46:07.531 --> 46:17.300
You see the bones of the building in the expression of the grid on the outside of the upper stories, and the two work beautifully together.

46:18.601 --> 46:20.343
I think we've got plenty of stuff.

46:20.423 --> 46:20.803
Okay, good.

46:20.984 --> 46:22.525
Would you add a couple of books for me?

46:22.565 --> 46:23.866
Absolutely.

46:24.127 --> 46:35.277
The main thing I want the series to do is to actually get people to go and look at the originals, because television is a poor reproductory medium, and nobody can really say that

46:37.012 --> 47:05.533
on TV but you know if you can I mean I would hope it sort of stimulates a desire to go and see the actual things and things is the operative word yeah and things is the operative word you know I mean people people walk past the Chrysler building every day and they don't think about it you know oh to see that in the sunset though oh fabulous the great gilded spire Jesus yeah wonderful that flat iron building down there oh yeah I love that

47:06.863 --> 47:08.266
I love New York, actually.

47:08.466 --> 47:10.411
So do I. And I hate it, too.

47:10.431 --> 47:15.863
Do you want to make a comment on New York or American cities in any way?

47:15.903 --> 47:21.034
Well, you know, I mean, it's the big fish hatchery, isn't it?

47:21.956 --> 47:23.860
You know.

47:24.818 --> 47:25.980
New York and Chicago.

47:26.040 --> 47:38.540
I mean, Boston is more like a cradle, but New York is the... I mean, not to denigrate Boston, but, you know, it's fascinating to come to Boston and see the... Well, you can almost see Boston Hall, really.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.483
Yes, you almost can.

47:40.503 --> 47:45.791
New York is always... I can even walk over there in Hell's Kitchen.

47:47.895 --> 47:50.539
The amazing thing is how fast it changes, you know.

47:51.413 --> 47:59.084
I mean, even in the time that I've been living in the same loft in downtown, you know, for the last 27 years, the whole area has sort of changed.

47:59.104 --> 48:07.255
I mean, some of its fundamental character remains, but it's a very different place to the one that I bought into in 1970, or even in 75.

48:08.056 --> 48:19.412
And, you know, it's become more like a gigantic fucking mall, you know, with all these, you know, I mean, you know, couture houses, I mean, well, you know, sort of mass clothing shops,

48:22.261 --> 48:23.403
It's gone a complete circle.

48:23.423 --> 48:26.527
It used to be that the clothing was manufactured there.

48:27.248 --> 48:34.119
And now, of course, you know, it's manufactured in Taiwan and then, you know, and sold and sold there.

48:34.159 --> 48:36.983
You know, you would go out in the morning and you'd see these great bales.

48:37.083 --> 48:49.922
I mean, it looked, Soho in those days, it looked like the art that was being made in it, minimalism, you know, with those big iron plates on the road and the, you know, these weird-looking bales and offcuts and, you know,

48:50.408 --> 49:02.160
cardboard cartons stacked everywhere, and now it's, you know, this sort of runway for models, you know.

49:02.281 --> 49:05.104
It's not that I've got anything against models.

49:05.124 --> 49:10.750
Well, when I was down there at Stephen Jacobs' house last year, they were shooting a big commercial thing.

49:10.790 --> 49:13.833
I mean, the street was closed, and they had all these crews and stuff.

49:13.853 --> 49:14.493
Tell me about it.

49:14.514 --> 49:15.875
It's an incredible pain in the ass.

49:15.935 --> 49:18.778
I mean, you've got a film crew down there three days, three, four days a week.

49:19.045 --> 49:22.033
Probably in a brassiere spot.

49:22.233 --> 49:23.096
Oh, yeah.

49:23.176 --> 49:34.084
Well, sometimes they're doing feature films, you know, and I must say, I was overcome with, I'd been overcome with jealousy at times when they were making Shock and I'd been making Fatal Eye, American Visions, because

49:34.553 --> 49:50.256
You know, when I think of the conditions we were baking our fucking series under, the entire makeup department consisted of a 79-cent comb, you know, known as the unit comb and carried in the PA's handbag.

49:50.917 --> 49:59.490
And far from having caravans and stuff, you know, we had two vans, you know, crammed with uncomfortable.

49:59.950 --> 50:03.075
And probably one take does it too, right?

50:03.308 --> 50:04.710
Well, no, no, no.

50:04.770 --> 50:05.751
I very seldom go.

50:05.871 --> 50:08.114
I think I only a few times got it done on the first time.

50:08.134 --> 50:16.265
I mean, out of the hundred or so stand-up pieces that I did, you know, I think I only ever really got it right twice on the first take.

50:16.826 --> 50:22.633
And the second time I did it was the very last shot of the series, you know, on top of the...

50:22.613 --> 50:25.215
Tyrell's Rodent Crater.

50:25.716 --> 50:27.618
And, you know, we had this helicopter.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.279
We only had the chopper for one day.

50:29.319 --> 50:34.164
And the shock required that I get the thing absolutely right, and then the chopper takes off and flies over me.

50:34.845 --> 50:38.088
And suffering cats... Don't fuck it up.

50:38.308 --> 50:39.049
Don't fuck it up.

50:39.069 --> 50:40.250
The sun's going down.

50:40.270 --> 50:42.352
You know, it was just disappearing behind that notch.

50:43.093 --> 50:48.258
You know, and I kept on doing my piece and thinking, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up.

50:48.278 --> 50:49.819
But actually, I didn't fuck it up because...

50:52.533 --> 50:53.414
That's been fun.

50:53.715 --> 50:53.995
Good.

50:58.481 --> 51:03.488
But you know, the whole cost of the series would have bought you about, you know, four million bucks or something.

51:03.508 --> 51:09.076
It would have bought you about two minutes and twenty seconds of Waterworld.

51:09.136 --> 51:09.977
Yeah.

51:10.438 --> 51:14.324
And look how... And look how... What a Waterworld.

51:14.344 --> 51:15.385
What a Waterworld.
