WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:15.009
Henrik, like Henry, but with a K at the end.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.111
So, Henrik Otto.

00:16.151 --> 00:16.792
Henrik Otto.

00:17.232 --> 00:18.374
And what's your job?

00:18.414 --> 00:19.776
What do you do here, Henrik?

00:19.936 --> 00:24.864
Yes, I'm working as a conservator since for 15 years.

00:24.944 --> 00:29.110
I have been working here for 15 years, and now I'm in the position of a conservator.

00:30.710 --> 00:33.936
A little sheaf somewhere in the middle.

00:34.116 --> 00:37.582
But your job is to preserve books?

00:37.943 --> 00:40.187
To preserve books, to conserve books, to preserve books.

00:40.547 --> 00:42.290
Yes, we have a large department.

00:42.791 --> 00:46.017
This department is divided in several sections.

00:46.037 --> 00:46.418
Okay.

00:46.438 --> 00:49.162
And now you are in the conservation department.

00:50.044 --> 00:50.625
We have...

00:51.280 --> 00:57.467
Other parts are the bindery, then the mass deacidification department.

00:57.728 --> 00:59.049
In which, I'm sorry?

00:59.069 --> 01:00.050
Mass deacidification.

01:00.071 --> 01:01.512
Mass deacidification, okay.

01:01.532 --> 01:01.632
Yeah.

01:02.473 --> 01:04.256
The bindery, the microfilming.

01:04.616 --> 01:05.036
Oh, good.

01:05.137 --> 01:06.358
And you're going to show me these places?

01:06.758 --> 01:08.080
Yes, I can do it.

01:08.100 --> 01:08.200
Good.

01:08.220 --> 01:08.621
Let's do that.

01:08.941 --> 01:15.329
But first, I want to introduce our traditional work for our traditional department, the conservation department.

01:16.210 --> 01:20.595
And in this department, we have three main technologies.

01:22.077 --> 01:28.605
We deal with wet treatment, leaf casting, and paper spreading.

01:28.625 --> 01:29.726
Wet treatment?

01:29.746 --> 01:32.810
Wet treatment, leaf casting.

01:33.371 --> 01:34.332
What's that?

01:34.352 --> 01:36.234
Why do you say that again?

01:36.835 --> 01:39.698
Leaf casting, it means to repair poles.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.041
Leaf, L-E-A-F?

01:42.382 --> 01:43.583
Yes, leaf casting.

01:44.124 --> 01:45.305
Casting, casting.

01:45.786 --> 01:46.887
And that repairs...

01:47.238 --> 01:49.161
Yes, you can repair holes.

01:49.181 --> 01:50.183
Repairs holes, okay.

01:50.203 --> 01:53.528
Yes, the colleagues are at work at the moment, you can see it.

01:53.908 --> 01:54.830
And then the third was?

01:55.511 --> 01:56.212
Paper splitting.

01:56.372 --> 01:57.714
Paper splitting, oh good.

01:57.734 --> 01:59.617
It's a technology to strengthen.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.502
That's a strengthening process.

02:02.802 --> 02:03.864
And that was developed here?

02:05.126 --> 02:09.312
In Germany, you can say, or yes, I think in Germany, yeah.

02:09.332 --> 02:10.314
Okay, good.

02:10.334 --> 02:10.654
I'm ready.

02:11.115 --> 02:11.676
Let's start.

02:12.398 --> 02:13.900
I can call you Henrik.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.060
Yes.

02:14.380 --> 02:15.261
And I'm Nick, OK?

02:15.541 --> 02:16.182
Nick.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.263
Wet treatment plant.

02:17.503 --> 02:18.284
Wet treatment.

02:18.504 --> 02:28.935
Wet treatment, it means for deacification, for bleaching, if you like.

02:28.955 --> 02:30.316
But bleaching is out.

02:30.336 --> 02:35.141
But you can also just infect paper if the paper has no glue or whatever.

02:35.161 --> 02:36.463
Not mushrooms, but oily.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.645
Yes, right.

02:38.665 --> 02:40.807
You have only one for the German.

02:40.827 --> 02:40.887
OK.

02:41.947 --> 02:46.234
So these, go ahead.

02:47.416 --> 02:59.075
And these, and these, all this is done in this plant.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.519
It has, it has got six spaces, the bath.

03:01.539 --> 03:02.341
One, two, three, four, five, yeah, okay.

03:02.361 --> 03:03.643
The bath contains all 220 liters.

03:03.663 --> 03:03.783
Okay.

03:03.803 --> 03:04.264
Can collect 220 liters.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.267
We have...

03:06.803 --> 03:10.848
the self-material or cassettes, we call it wet treatment cassettes.

03:11.889 --> 03:19.237
You can see one cassette on work, it's sitting there.

03:19.257 --> 03:22.101
And you can identify that the leaves, the single leaves are between.

03:22.922 --> 03:25.685
Okay, well now, these are books?

03:25.985 --> 03:26.366
Yes.

03:26.386 --> 03:31.071
This was a form of books, and then the books were combined.

03:31.091 --> 03:35.376
And the single sheets, we put it between the leaves of

03:36.875 --> 03:40.460
This material, plastic foil or plastic days, gas.

03:41.361 --> 03:50.995
It's a kind of mosquito.

03:52.578 --> 03:53.479
Mosquito net.

03:53.499 --> 03:54.701
Mosquito net, okay.

03:54.941 --> 03:56.564
But these are book pages, right?

03:56.584 --> 03:57.124
Yeah.

03:57.204 --> 03:57.425
Okay.

03:58.386 --> 04:02.512
And you can do 220 liters in each... In each bath.

04:02.873 --> 04:06.578
We have a liter for heating.

04:07.013 --> 04:11.439
And we can also measure the temperature and... Yeah.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.082
What is the chemical that you use?

04:15.385 --> 04:16.707
Natrium-bohydrate.

04:16.727 --> 04:22.736
In English it has another name.

04:23.016 --> 04:23.717
Natrium-bohydrate.

04:23.737 --> 04:25.179
We use different chemicals.

04:25.199 --> 04:31.789
Usually we start with the hot water bottles and then we have different steps causing the damage.

04:32.208 --> 04:35.732
Usually we deal with wood pulp paper, with acid paper.

04:35.972 --> 04:37.234
Wood pulp and acid paper.

04:38.255 --> 04:43.621
Like the paper which is used since last century.

04:43.641 --> 04:44.302
I see, yes.

04:44.322 --> 04:44.542
Yes.

04:45.043 --> 04:47.806
It's a typical wood pulp.

04:47.826 --> 04:48.066
Exactly.

04:48.086 --> 04:51.210
Now, these people are preparing the material for here?

04:52.131 --> 04:53.472
No, this is the second step.

04:53.492 --> 04:54.193
This is all this.

04:54.213 --> 04:55.995
The first step is wet treatment.

04:56.015 --> 04:59.519
The first step is the binding, wet treatment.

04:59.539 --> 05:00.460
Wet treatment means...

05:00.727 --> 05:08.931
Stop the aging, stop the aging of the... That's okay, you just keep talking.

05:20.858 --> 05:23.684
Yes, please tell me when you can't understand me.

05:23.704 --> 05:24.045
Okay.

05:24.065 --> 05:25.869
So I start to describe it.

05:25.909 --> 05:26.931
That's all right.

05:27.052 --> 05:29.597
I never hesitate, so you're doing fine.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.183
Now these are newspapers that they're doing here.

05:32.484 --> 05:37.314
Yes, these are newspapers, and now they are leaf casting the newspapers, the single sheets.

05:37.555 --> 05:38.577
Leaf casting them?

05:38.597 --> 05:39.198
Leaf casting them.

05:39.218 --> 05:40.120
That's what you told me.

05:40.241 --> 05:40.842
Okay, yes.

05:41.176 --> 05:57.271
You can see the hole in the paper, and afterwards the hole will be covered with new fibers, with new pipe.

05:57.291 --> 05:57.392
Okay.

05:57.412 --> 05:58.173
It's similar to a paper paper machine.

05:58.193 --> 05:58.434
Okay, I see.

05:58.454 --> 05:58.915
You can see, I believe.

05:59.333 --> 06:06.644
That's putting new paper on?

06:06.784 --> 06:07.786
Yeah, new fibers.

06:08.427 --> 06:09.208
New fibers.

06:09.228 --> 06:10.069
New fibers.

06:10.130 --> 06:10.530
New fibers.

06:10.550 --> 06:11.972
It's adding new fibers.

06:11.992 --> 06:12.393
New fibers.

06:13.254 --> 06:18.482
It can be on the outskirts, outside, but it can also like inside.

06:18.502 --> 06:20.225
And so where are the fibers being added?

06:20.245 --> 06:21.146
Right in here?

06:21.166 --> 06:23.610
Yeah, in this position.

06:23.630 --> 06:24.852
What is this machine called?

06:25.253 --> 06:45.912
leaf casting that's the machine it's called a leaf casting machine yes and the technology is also leaf casting okay it's a leaf casting okay it's produced in denmark i see and that's the company right there get get free no it's not written there it's air lawson okay air lawson in danish

06:46.516 --> 06:46.997
Whatever.

06:48.579 --> 06:50.541
This is water now?

06:50.561 --> 06:52.023
Water and fibers only.

06:52.043 --> 06:55.588
Water and fibers only.

06:55.608 --> 06:58.432
Without color, without something else.

06:58.452 --> 07:02.577
So each one of those baskets can hold 220 liters.

07:02.938 --> 07:08.986
So that's 1,200 and 1,300 liters that you can do at one time.

07:10.007 --> 07:11.790
And how many times a day can you do that?

07:14.333 --> 07:14.413
Yes.

07:14.680 --> 07:28.278
We can deal with leaf casting in different steps, but it doesn't matter if we need one, two, or three passes.

07:28.298 --> 07:29.739
It's always one line.

07:29.759 --> 07:29.920
I see.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.502
It's like an assembly.

07:31.782 --> 07:32.002
Yeah, yeah.

07:32.022 --> 07:32.403
Okay, I understand.

07:32.423 --> 07:32.823
Like a cyclus.

07:32.843 --> 07:32.924
Yes.

07:33.725 --> 07:39.192
It's always the first step and then it's the second step.

07:39.212 --> 07:44.198
Fifth step repairs the holes and we get a larger format, a larger size, because we want to have

07:45.275 --> 08:09.932
standardy sizes now that's the paper that they're putting the fiber that they're putting the paper on now when they're done will it go back into a volume or something and then the last step the third step is paper splitting okay paper splitting and to get to know it i want to show you some pictures excellent good to understand it

08:14.772 --> 08:15.613
faster.

08:15.633 --> 08:16.674
This is for single sheets.

08:17.154 --> 08:19.637
It's more, also, yes.

08:21.259 --> 08:22.360
Single sheets, yeah.

08:22.380 --> 08:30.068
Single sheets, and this is a continuous working machine, and you can work with, you can deal with many, with plenty of sheets.

08:30.088 --> 08:30.348
I see.

08:30.368 --> 08:30.829
Of sheets.

08:30.849 --> 08:39.818
This is for single sheets.

08:40.490 --> 08:45.477
You get to note leaf casting cassettes in this other system.

08:45.758 --> 08:52.928
In this system, you can roll the single sheets in between these layers of gazes.

08:53.028 --> 08:53.649
You roll it in.

08:54.170 --> 08:55.291
And what is this material?

08:55.752 --> 08:56.713
Mosquito.

08:57.334 --> 08:57.875
Mosquito?

08:58.095 --> 08:58.456
Yeah.

08:59.237 --> 09:00.118
What is it made out of?

09:00.439 --> 09:02.902
Ah, I have to ask.

09:03.984 --> 09:05.125
But you call it mosquito.

09:05.826 --> 09:09.291
Yeah, to get an idea about it.

09:09.592 --> 09:09.872
Okay.

09:10.190 --> 09:14.436
Then I have to pick it up, to look it out.

09:14.516 --> 09:16.820
Okay, okay, fine.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.722
It's not a gauge, a plastic thing, yeah?

09:18.803 --> 09:23.369
A plastic gauge, yeah, a gauge, yeah.

09:23.389 --> 09:23.630
Okay.

09:23.930 --> 09:27.435
These pictures tell you something about paper splitting.

09:27.876 --> 09:34.285
Paper splitting means we cover our original paper from both sides, from front and from back.

09:34.305 --> 09:35.147
There's another paper.

09:35.427 --> 09:36.509
We call it carry paper.

09:36.929 --> 09:37.530
What kind?

09:37.831 --> 09:40.275
carry paper or support paper.

09:40.976 --> 09:47.045
You can see it on the sample so you can find out the real name.

09:48.387 --> 09:57.461
The first picture I'll show you, we take the glue on the surface of the first carry paper with a gluing machine.

09:58.703 --> 10:00.746
That removes the glue?

10:00.766 --> 10:04.412
Yes, we put it on the first carry paper.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.482
Then we add our original.

10:06.842 --> 10:11.167
In this case, it's a sheet of paper which is broken in the middle.

10:11.988 --> 10:12.808
It's an old picture.

10:14.130 --> 10:19.976
And then we prepare the second sheet of carry paper and cover it.

10:20.737 --> 10:22.038
Carry paper, you call it.

10:22.058 --> 10:23.780
Yes, carry paper, support paper.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.323
You can find it out to describe it in the best way.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.647
And afterwards, we get a system of three layers.

10:31.288 --> 10:33.150
Carry paper, return carry paper.

10:33.417 --> 10:33.878
I see.

10:34.258 --> 10:44.375
Then we put it in the press, leave it there overnight, and on the next day, two colleagues will do the work of paper-spilling.

10:44.395 --> 10:51.006
It means they're sitting opposite each other and start to clear on the corners.

10:51.026 --> 10:51.988
People have to do this.

10:52.348 --> 10:52.669
People.

10:52.729 --> 10:54.632
Yes, we have two ways.

10:55.456 --> 10:57.659
He can do it with hand and he can do it with machine.

10:57.780 --> 11:00.844
And this picture is showing us the way of doing it with hand.

11:00.864 --> 11:03.108
But my question is, this is very slow.

11:03.188 --> 11:04.750
You've got millions of pages here.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.414
How can you possibly do them all?

11:07.775 --> 11:14.866
But in this way, our annual work is 22,000 sheets.

11:15.146 --> 11:16.648
22,000 sheets a year.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.773
It doesn't matter large or small, 22,000.

11:19.934 --> 11:24.180
Because this is our measuring.

11:25.021 --> 11:27.204
Shoes we measure in single sheets.

11:27.344 --> 11:29.127
Okay, measure in sheets.

11:29.147 --> 11:29.507
In sheets.

11:31.070 --> 11:35.216
So if a book has 600 pages, is that 1,200 sheets?

11:36.377 --> 11:39.662
Is each sheet 2 once you split it, or is each sheet 1?

11:40.203 --> 11:45.050
Yeah, just one sheet, one leaf.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.151
A leaf has two pages.

11:46.231 --> 11:50.457
A leaf has two pages, okay.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.419
Okay.

11:51.599 --> 11:53.121
And this is the way of splitting.

11:53.303 --> 11:59.691
We start sitting opposite each other and start to tear on the corner and then the paper will open.

11:59.731 --> 12:05.457
We tear it, we tear it until we reach.

12:06.999 --> 12:09.442
This spot is the angle.

12:10.323 --> 12:13.627
The angle was built by the carry paper.

12:14.288 --> 12:20.015
This is the original inside, but the carry paper is longer only on one side.

12:20.956 --> 12:22.838
There the carry paper is sticking together

12:23.122 --> 12:24.624
immediately, directly.

12:25.124 --> 12:26.186
It is our angle.

12:26.206 --> 12:26.706
I understand.

12:26.726 --> 12:28.849
It's open, so you like to open the door.

12:29.770 --> 12:33.134
We won't have two single sheets which are flying.

12:33.435 --> 12:35.037
We want to open, we want to shut it.

12:35.837 --> 12:37.520
So this here is one sheet?

12:37.920 --> 12:38.260
Yeah.

12:38.701 --> 12:42.586
So even though now that you're splitting it into two, it's still one?

12:42.606 --> 12:43.727
In two halves.

12:43.747 --> 12:44.168
In two halves.

12:44.228 --> 12:46.631
But in terms of the 22,000, that's one?

12:47.211 --> 12:48.313
This is one.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.897
Just in the middle of the process.

12:52.298 --> 12:59.447
It's open, and these pictures tell you some details of opening, and you can see, you can identify the leaf casting.

12:59.968 --> 13:01.190
Leaf casting is outside.

13:02.071 --> 13:02.752
Leaf casting is outside.

13:02.772 --> 13:04.194
Leaf casting is the big word here.

13:04.975 --> 13:06.076
Yeah, I don't know.

13:06.336 --> 13:07.057
No, I like it.

13:07.618 --> 13:10.302
No, no, I like it.

13:11.383 --> 13:13.846
I like words that I can use, you know, for my writing.

13:14.287 --> 13:16.189
Now this one, wait, okay, go ahead.

13:16.770 --> 13:20.675
Yes, and now it's open, and now we can add a core paper.

13:20.755 --> 13:21.917
We call it core paper.

13:22.437 --> 13:23.778
Because it's in the middle.

13:23.818 --> 13:25.400
It's in the middle of the paper.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.422
It will go in the middle of the paper.

13:27.983 --> 13:30.666
This is no longer the carry paper now.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.308
This is another paper.

13:32.348 --> 13:33.749
The carry paper is outside.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.111
You can't see it in this moment.

13:35.651 --> 13:36.973
And this paper is new.

13:37.073 --> 13:37.513
We added.

13:37.994 --> 13:39.255
Now this, what do you call this again?

13:39.595 --> 13:40.196
Core paper.

13:40.396 --> 13:40.777
Core.

13:41.077 --> 13:41.878
C-O-R-E.

13:42.018 --> 13:42.298
Yes.

13:42.318 --> 13:43.039
Yes, middle.

13:43.059 --> 13:44.421
Okay, core paper.

13:44.521 --> 13:46.343
And Apple has cores in the middle.

13:46.683 --> 13:47.684
Core, which means the middle.

13:47.764 --> 13:49.146
Core paper goes in the middle.

13:49.266 --> 13:49.706
I got you.

13:50.067 --> 13:50.267
Yes.

13:50.988 --> 13:52.309
And then we shut it.

13:53.538 --> 13:55.340
And then we shut the paper.

13:57.822 --> 13:59.503
You can see we add the cord paper.

14:00.004 --> 14:00.885
And then we shut it.

14:01.725 --> 14:02.686
And then finish.

14:03.307 --> 14:09.713
And then afterwards, of course, we have to remove to solve the carry paper and through it.

14:09.753 --> 14:12.695
Because these papers were just the way of doing.

14:12.976 --> 14:15.177
They were intermediate steps.

14:15.218 --> 14:17.139
Yeah, intermediate steps.

14:17.159 --> 14:19.541
So then you get rid of the carry paper when you're done.

14:19.842 --> 14:20.702
Yeah, yeah.

14:20.803 --> 14:22.684
Okay, I understand.

14:22.704 --> 14:23.545
It's not permanent.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.692
No, it's not coming.

14:26.153 --> 14:28.356
So what stays is the core paper.

14:28.376 --> 14:33.863
The core paper is in the middle and it gives the paper more stronger strength.

14:33.983 --> 14:34.584
And strength.

14:35.044 --> 14:38.509
Yes, and strength.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.250
I'm doing all right.

14:39.350 --> 14:46.379
I understand what you're trying to do, so I'm helping you.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.560
What are these pictures of?

14:47.600 --> 14:53.768
These pictures show you typical damages which you can...

14:54.220 --> 14:55.802
deal with paper spitting.

14:57.585 --> 15:15.030
The damage of ink or color eaten, color eaten with the fibers, yes you can see it like there's a ribbon and oath, it's like it comes out.

15:15.110 --> 15:19.637
And the core paper can keep it in the middle, it can keep it on

15:20.090 --> 15:22.237
on its face.

15:22.257 --> 15:27.252
So, it won't go lost.

15:27.273 --> 15:28.436
Okay, go ahead on this one.

15:28.537 --> 15:30.623
Yes, this is typically very good.

15:30.923 --> 15:33.087
Not acid-free, acid with pipe paper.

15:33.688 --> 15:35.612
You have the damage of water.

15:35.932 --> 15:41.683
Water usually comes with the damage of mouth, getting cloudy.

15:41.763 --> 15:44.990
This is before the treatment, after the treatment.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.392
That's after the treatment.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.374
After the treatment.

15:47.394 --> 15:47.474
Wow.

15:47.695 --> 15:48.476
Yes, you can see.

15:48.977 --> 15:51.281
This part is up by leaf casting.

15:51.302 --> 15:51.582
Yes, sir.

15:52.523 --> 16:00.273
Originally it was eaten away, got lost, and saw the art, new parts of paper, and can be splitted.

16:00.754 --> 16:06.001
And splitting has a good joining between the new and the old paper.

16:06.021 --> 16:13.911
This is the old one, this is the new one, and the core comes from one edge to another edge, and goes through the whole paper.

16:13.931 --> 16:20.860
But you can't restore any of the material that's gone obviously, it's just going to be restored in the blank area.

16:21.025 --> 16:33.944
Just the area, just the paper.

16:33.964 --> 16:35.266
We're going to have some... I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.027
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:36.047 --> 16:36.788
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:36.808 --> 16:37.549
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:37.569 --> 16:38.310
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.072
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:39.092 --> 16:39.833
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:39.853 --> 16:39.953
Okay.

16:39.973 --> 16:40.714
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:40.734 --> 16:41.475
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:41.495 --> 16:41.595
Okay.

16:41.615 --> 16:42.356
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.118
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:43.138 --> 16:43.238
Okay.

16:43.258 --> 16:43.999
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:44.019 --> 16:44.760
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:44.780 --> 16:44.880
Okay.

16:44.900 --> 16:45.641
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:45.661 --> 16:46.402
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:46.422 --> 16:46.523
Okay.

16:46.543 --> 16:47.284
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:47.304 --> 16:47.404
Okay.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.165
I'm going to have a little bit of it.

16:48.185 --> 16:48.285
Okay.

16:48.305 --> 16:48.906
I'm going to have a little bit

16:49.240 --> 16:50.682
That's infection.

16:50.782 --> 16:53.224
It just infected the paper.

16:53.244 --> 16:55.086
To destroy the moody power.

17:01.233 --> 17:01.753
Okay, good.

17:01.994 --> 17:06.378
And this is normal, as you can see, wood type and pencil paper.

17:07.059 --> 17:11.123
And these are like blank sections that have been added to it.

17:11.143 --> 17:18.351
Yeah, it's a former repairing or a former try of repairing that seemed to be the case before.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.112
I see, yes, okay.

17:19.885 --> 17:29.262
This is the paper splitting machine.

17:31.346 --> 17:34.331
Wow.

17:38.999 --> 17:42.145
So now you're going to do a picture.

17:42.165 --> 17:42.265
Yeah.

17:48.758 --> 17:49.279
Okay.

17:49.299 --> 17:55.768
Support paper, public paper.

17:55.828 --> 17:57.170
Now it's open.

17:57.270 --> 18:00.335
You open it, and then you can add the core paper.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.119
So this is actually a split sheet.

18:03.139 --> 18:04.340
Yes, it's a split sheet.

18:05.081 --> 18:08.146
So this sheet was actually... It was one.

18:08.446 --> 18:09.628
It was one.

18:09.908 --> 18:11.651
And it comes back to one again.

18:11.671 --> 18:13.834
Wow.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.619
That is amazing.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.040
Yeah.

18:18.475 --> 18:20.658
Is this the core paper or kind of core paper?

18:21.980 --> 18:22.861
We have different kinds.

18:22.881 --> 18:24.844
It's almost like a tissue, actually, isn't it?

18:24.864 --> 18:25.544
Yes, it is a tissue.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.949
It's a little familiar to cigarette paper.

18:29.189 --> 18:31.673
It's a little familiar to teabag paper.

18:32.614 --> 18:33.195
But it isn't.

18:34.236 --> 18:36.820
But to get an idea about it.

18:37.541 --> 18:38.161
Yeah.

18:38.181 --> 18:39.243
Yeah.

18:39.263 --> 18:40.465
It contains carbonate.

18:41.306 --> 18:42.207
Calcium carbonate.

18:43.368 --> 18:44.149
No, carbon.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.812
Yeah, calcium carbonate.

18:46.853 --> 18:47.554
C-A-

18:47.804 --> 18:50.808
CO3 calcium carbonate.

18:50.928 --> 18:51.950
CaCO3?

18:51.970 --> 18:52.130
Yeah.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.334
It's very important.

18:55.615 --> 18:56.216
CaCO3?

18:56.376 --> 18:57.177
Yes, you're right.

18:58.278 --> 19:00.281
To avoid aging of the paper.

19:02.023 --> 19:09.253
And it's now used by the paper industry to protect the paper for aging.

19:09.353 --> 19:10.135
It's called buffer.

19:10.715 --> 19:11.536
Alkaline buffer.

19:12.137 --> 19:13.339
Alkaline buffer.

19:13.479 --> 19:14.160
Yeah.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.343
And this paper contains the alkaline buffer.

19:16.778 --> 19:17.058
I see.

19:17.078 --> 19:18.040
And it comes in the middle.

19:18.561 --> 19:26.993
And also the glue we use for sticking, for stick it in, contains also alkaline buffer.

19:27.013 --> 19:27.153
Uh-huh.

19:27.173 --> 19:27.414
Yeah?

19:28.575 --> 19:34.844
And we have a similar work process, like you would do it by hand.

19:34.864 --> 19:38.850
We have two carry papers.

19:40.092 --> 19:42.676
Yeah, this is the term who could use it.

19:44.839 --> 19:45.520
Which could use it?

19:47.693 --> 19:49.816
Preservo-tech.

19:49.836 --> 19:51.338
Preservo-tech, yeah.

19:52.239 --> 19:55.684
But in history, not a sheet.

19:56.085 --> 19:57.026
This is special size.

19:57.767 --> 20:00.150
Instead of a sheet, we have long tapes.

20:00.651 --> 20:03.755
One tape is 250 meters wide.

20:04.576 --> 20:07.120
And those tapes come together.

20:07.801 --> 20:14.810
But before they come together, they join their own news station.

20:14.830 --> 20:16.873
This is here, a plume sheet.

20:17.123 --> 20:19.727
And the machine is there.

20:19.747 --> 20:21.669
And now the glue is up on the surface.

20:22.811 --> 20:25.815
And from this place, we can up our regionals.

20:26.756 --> 20:32.784
And for this work, it's very important that we work with standard sizes.

20:32.805 --> 20:40.095
And standard sizes, we get by the leaf casting process.

20:40.175 --> 20:41.436
You can see standard size.

20:43.599 --> 20:46.303
And the leaf is leaf casted before.

20:46.975 --> 20:48.938
So it's easier to work, easier to handle.

20:49.598 --> 20:59.231
Yes, we have smaller sheets, we have larger sheets, larger sheets, and we want to have a standard size.

20:59.251 --> 21:03.136
Now, have these already been through the deacidification process out there?

21:03.156 --> 21:03.496
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.797 --> 21:08.583
So that... First step, that treatment, second step, deep casting, third step.

21:08.783 --> 21:12.708
So, one is the wet, right?

21:13.770 --> 21:14.691
Washing, washing.

21:14.711 --> 21:14.931
Washing.

21:15.792 --> 21:16.273
Washing.

21:16.439 --> 21:20.824
like to remove or neutralize the acid in the paper.

21:20.864 --> 21:24.689
To neutralize acid is the main step one.

21:24.969 --> 21:36.644
Step two is leaf casting to repair holes and to have a standard size to deal with it.

21:36.664 --> 21:41.029
So it can go into this machine.

21:41.566 --> 21:42.687
And then this is three.

21:42.747 --> 21:45.509
You call this the paper splitting, right?

21:45.670 --> 21:48.432
The paper splitting machine.

21:48.452 --> 21:49.853
How many of these machines do you have?

21:50.113 --> 21:50.694
Just this one?

21:51.214 --> 21:51.835
Just this one.

21:52.015 --> 21:54.037
It's the first one in the world.

21:54.057 --> 21:57.079
This is the first one in the... Yeah.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.002
And where was it built?

22:00.322 --> 22:00.923
In Germany.

22:01.543 --> 22:04.125
Right there.

22:04.366 --> 22:04.706
Yes.

22:04.726 --> 22:05.667
You took a picture.

22:05.687 --> 22:08.049
Good, I have it, yes.

22:08.069 --> 22:08.189
Here?

22:08.389 --> 22:09.830
Yes, and the outdoor.

22:09.870 --> 22:10.611
The paper here?

22:12.886 --> 22:24.420
It goes through the machine, through the rollers, at the press station to press it.

22:24.881 --> 22:30.688
And in this spot, it will be split.

22:30.728 --> 22:42.323
To remember what's going on.

22:42.343 --> 22:42.403
OK.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.352
It's a system of three layers.

22:45.372 --> 22:49.075
Carry paper, original in the middle, carry paper again.

22:49.095 --> 22:55.000
You can also say a strong carry and an old, weak, original.

22:55.801 --> 22:59.004
And a strong, and a strong carry paper again.

23:02.968 --> 23:03.928
Now it comes out.

23:05.530 --> 23:09.293
And the power cord, the power cord, start the tool.

23:09.573 --> 23:12.576
And our paper will end up in front of each other.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.834
and it comes together, the two halves comes together here.

23:17.355 --> 23:25.788
But before they come together, a glue machine will add the glue for the core paper, and this is our core paper.

23:26.869 --> 23:36.123
Each half gets its own glue machine or half its own screw machine, add the glue, and the core paper will add here.

23:37.044 --> 23:39.508
So then it's done.

23:40.602 --> 23:42.485
And it's covered.

23:42.505 --> 23:51.278
And now the last, the final step is removing the carry paper by, uh, by Prince's machine.

23:51.298 --> 23:52.820
And this machine is at the moment built.

23:53.982 --> 23:54.382
It's what?

23:54.763 --> 23:55.484
Yeah.

23:55.504 --> 23:55.904
It's new.

23:56.485 --> 23:56.786
I see.

23:56.806 --> 23:58.028
And that, what do you call that machine?

23:59.790 --> 24:01.272
Upload the machine.

24:01.292 --> 24:01.993
But what does it do?

24:02.093 --> 24:05.719
It, uh... It solves the carry paper.

24:07.001 --> 24:07.541
It solves it.

24:07.962 --> 24:08.503
Oh, I see.

24:09.364 --> 24:09.985
So you can...

24:10.437 --> 24:11.018
Take it away.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.199
Oh, it removes the carry paper.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.221
So we remove the carry paper.

24:20.006 --> 24:21.207
The machines are down today?

24:21.267 --> 24:22.548
They're not working today?

24:22.568 --> 24:23.949
No, not yet.

24:24.209 --> 24:25.170
Oh, right.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.332
What do we expect in the next days?

24:28.153 --> 24:29.554
I see.

24:29.574 --> 24:33.318
It has got three pairs of bars.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.579
Three pairs of what?

24:35.099 --> 24:35.620
Barses.

24:36.621 --> 24:38.282
Basins.

24:38.482 --> 24:40.444
Bars to deep it in.

24:40.863 --> 24:41.864
Keep it in water.

24:42.185 --> 24:42.445
I see.

24:42.505 --> 24:43.366
Baths.

24:43.466 --> 24:43.786
Baths.

24:43.927 --> 24:44.948
Okay, these are the baths.

24:45.068 --> 24:45.588
Baths.

24:47.090 --> 24:47.971
Okay, baths.

24:48.832 --> 24:50.314
B-A-T-H.

24:50.354 --> 24:52.256
Okay, bath.

24:53.878 --> 24:54.939
So it's going to get wet again?

24:55.480 --> 24:56.221
Yeah, wet again.

24:57.262 --> 25:01.547
All these like a snake comes up and down, up and down.

25:02.508 --> 25:05.431
So it gets wet again after it's already been through.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.053
What's the purpose of doing this again?

25:07.774 --> 25:08.575
To remove

25:09.263 --> 25:10.244
The carry paper.

25:10.264 --> 25:12.786
The carry paper, and we do it with, like, that treatment.

25:13.046 --> 25:13.747
I see.

25:13.767 --> 25:14.468
Okay.

25:14.488 --> 25:19.212
The crossbar contains enzymes.

25:19.232 --> 25:20.133
Enzymes.

25:20.153 --> 25:25.217
Enzymes, because the traffic people will stick by gelatine.

25:25.237 --> 25:26.559
Gelatine.

25:26.899 --> 25:27.319
Gelatine.

25:27.339 --> 25:27.620
Okay.

25:27.640 --> 25:32.704
And they will stick by gelatine, and gelatine is what they ask.

25:32.724 --> 25:32.984
Yep.

25:33.104 --> 25:36.347
And so we can destroy the gelatine with enzyme.

25:38.810 --> 25:39.270
Okay.

25:39.622 --> 25:47.213
The second layer is for killing the enzymes.

25:47.513 --> 25:48.034
We hot it.

25:48.415 --> 25:52.100
We rise the temperature.

25:52.120 --> 25:56.306
We rise the temperature and the enzymes getting dead.

25:56.326 --> 25:57.388
Kill the enzyme.

25:57.528 --> 25:59.571
And kill the enzyme.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.755
And the last cover is going up.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.157
Rinsing.

26:04.398 --> 26:04.778
Rinsing.

26:04.998 --> 26:05.419
Rinsing.

26:05.599 --> 26:05.980
Rinsing.

26:06.220 --> 26:06.561
Rinsing.

26:06.641 --> 26:07.502
Just spülen.

26:08.022 --> 26:08.563
rinsing.

26:08.703 --> 26:09.464
Just water.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.046
Just water.

26:11.948 --> 26:13.190
Cleaning, wringing.

26:13.630 --> 26:15.152
To kill enzymes.

26:15.172 --> 26:17.456
And what was the one?

26:17.696 --> 26:18.778
What happened over here again?

26:18.838 --> 26:21.301
This was an enzyme treatment.

26:21.542 --> 26:22.463
Enzyme treatment.

26:22.864 --> 26:23.925
To eat the gelatine.

26:23.945 --> 26:25.227
Oh, so that adds the enzyme.

26:25.508 --> 26:26.068
Yes.

26:26.289 --> 26:30.034
And this was the enzymes added to eat the gelatine.

26:30.675 --> 26:31.016
Okay.

26:31.436 --> 26:32.938
And then this kills the enzyme.

26:33.579 --> 26:34.080
Kings the enzyme.

26:34.313 --> 26:39.040
So you add the enzyme here, you remove the enzyme here, and then you rinse here.

26:39.361 --> 26:41.804
And then you dry it probably over here.

26:42.205 --> 26:43.346
Yeah, and just try it.

26:43.387 --> 26:46.912
Yes, you're right.

26:46.932 --> 26:49.836
It's similar, you would try photos.

26:49.856 --> 26:51.899
Yes, that's what it looks like.

26:53.261 --> 27:01.434
So it's actually, well, almost, this is like a one, two, three, eight stages here actually.

27:01.614 --> 27:03.797
How long does it take to go from the front?

27:04.199 --> 27:10.249
It's continuous, of course.

27:10.489 --> 27:18.982
The aim is we want to have a continuous process, but at the moment we stop after spitting and then we start again here.

27:19.002 --> 27:25.152
But the idea is to have a continuous process with these long tapes.

27:27.115 --> 27:28.958
So the whole tape comes through

27:30.473 --> 27:38.042
But how long does it take for one piece to get from the front to the end, would you say?

27:38.063 --> 27:43.229
The machine is working with a speed of 2.5 meters a minute.

27:43.770 --> 27:47.074
It's not very fast, it's quite slow.

27:48.576 --> 27:58.388
But we have to work this way.

28:00.680 --> 28:23.704
It's heatable, it's warm, and the tapes come through, and the tapes will cut here.

28:24.304 --> 28:29.910
Here's an optic and a system who can identify

28:33.383 --> 28:49.000
And so did you, again, I missed it, did you tell me the speed at which it travels through?

28:49.020 --> 28:52.684
2.5 meters per minute.

28:56.689 --> 28:57.390
That's pretty good.

28:57.710 --> 29:03.036
And when it's working, is it working all day?

29:03.235 --> 29:04.677
Our staff forces limit.

29:05.058 --> 29:15.433
We don't have enough staff to work on the machine, but we are, at the moment, in the process of privatizing.

29:16.315 --> 29:18.257
Ah, so you're going outside.

29:18.318 --> 29:19.219
Yes, going outside.

29:19.259 --> 29:24.747
So are there any other machines like this, or is this still the only one, I wonder?

29:25.508 --> 29:30.516
This is the only one in the Bay of Paper Spreading, but we have also a mass gasification plant.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.078
What's the first step?

29:32.193 --> 29:38.699
I want to go back with you in the workshop, and then we want to have a look on samples.

29:38.779 --> 29:39.020
Good.

29:44.705 --> 29:46.767
Now these are books that have been brought down.

29:46.787 --> 29:49.089
Yes, yes.

29:49.109 --> 29:49.870
These books are.

29:49.890 --> 29:50.651
Oh, these are done?

29:51.231 --> 29:52.212
Yes, these books are done.

29:53.133 --> 29:57.137
And on the corner are books which are not done, not yet done.

29:57.918 --> 30:01.221
Yes, and you can see, ah, let's have a few more.

30:04.947 --> 30:14.461
Let's go.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.445
I'm trying to get a picture of these books here.

30:15.465 --> 30:15.565
Yeah.

30:16.878 --> 30:41.182
It's just normal, common, let's start with the library stuff.

30:41.203 --> 30:41.563
The library stuff.

30:41.583 --> 30:41.883
We have a book.

30:41.903 --> 30:43.665
After 30, 40 years of aging, or keeping, before, there's its really, really bad damages.

30:43.685 --> 30:44.005
This is typical.

30:44.025 --> 30:44.466
You can't do anything.

30:44.486 --> 30:45.086
It's not the code of the user.

30:45.106 --> 30:45.687
It's just aging, getting old.

30:45.953 --> 31:02.814
Getting brittle during the years.

31:02.834 --> 31:06.279
And this is the same book after treatment.

31:06.299 --> 31:06.819
Wow.

31:06.839 --> 31:07.160
Please touch it.

31:07.180 --> 31:08.982
Please touch the page and feel how does it feel.

31:09.002 --> 31:10.484
It feels stronger and solid and you can move it out of the box.

31:10.504 --> 31:11.245
Hold it up like that.

31:11.345 --> 31:11.665
Just hold it.

31:11.685 --> 31:12.887
Would you just hold the page so I get a picture of it?

31:12.907 --> 31:13.007
Yeah.

31:12.987 --> 31:35.825
Yes, you can see here are still some of the drivers from the loop parking.

31:35.845 --> 31:37.127
It's also a protection against mechanical damages in the future.

31:37.147 --> 31:37.608
So we need, we need it.

31:37.628 --> 31:38.269
So, attrition, that's important.

31:38.705 --> 31:42.444
We want to do this.

31:42.464 --> 31:44.434
It's our intention to do this.

31:44.454 --> 31:45.137
But your intention to what?

31:45.674 --> 31:48.858
to leave some fibers.

31:49.079 --> 31:53.905
Yes, okay, on the outside.

31:53.925 --> 32:00.895
On the outside, like protection against mechanical things, and also chemical, because the aging start always comes to light.

32:01.536 --> 32:07.564
It comes through the humidity, and the light, and everything, and the temperature, and so we have the fibers out.

32:07.584 --> 32:09.788
And what is this, like an old city directory or something like that?

32:09.808 --> 32:14.794
Yeah, like, yeah, telephone book.

32:14.815 --> 32:15.175
But you're saving.

32:15.560 --> 32:38.388
We are an archive and we have to do everything and it doesn't matter if it's just a simple book or something other.

32:38.408 --> 32:39.830
We don't decide what we have to do.

32:39.850 --> 32:40.510
The decision is of other persons.

32:40.530 --> 32:41.472
You down here don't decide what you have to do.

32:41.492 --> 32:41.972
We don't decide it, yes.

32:41.992 --> 32:42.613
We are not in charge to decide.

32:44.365 --> 32:52.515
That's very important.

32:53.115 --> 32:57.240
Okay, good.

33:00.104 --> 33:02.186
You're just a service.

33:02.707 --> 33:05.790
That's 1924.

33:06.011 --> 33:07.552
What does this say?

33:07.573 --> 33:08.293
Leipziger Adressbuch.

33:08.313 --> 33:10.116
It's a book to inform you about who is living there.

33:10.136 --> 33:10.496
The city directly.

33:10.916 --> 33:11.237
It's a retailer.

33:11.938 --> 33:12.639
Leipziger.

33:12.659 --> 33:13.079
Leipziger Adressbuch.

33:13.099 --> 33:13.319
Okay.

33:13.339 --> 33:13.800
A-D-R-E-W-S-S.

33:13.820 --> 33:13.900
Yes.

33:14.302 --> 33:38.545
Did you make a new binding too?

33:38.565 --> 33:39.026
Is there a new binding?

33:39.046 --> 33:41.288
Yes, we made a new binding, but in this case we have still some original, but not every book has original cover.

33:41.926 --> 33:57.685
So if we don't have a original any longer, so we have to add a new one.

33:57.705 --> 34:04.493
We have to make a new one.

34:04.513 --> 34:04.813
A new one.

34:05.114 --> 34:06.075
Ah, this is another thing.

34:06.095 --> 34:06.755
Uniform and Mars.

34:06.776 --> 34:06.876
Haha.

34:06.896 --> 34:06.996
Okay.

34:07.016 --> 34:07.156
Yeah.

34:07.176 --> 34:07.977
Newtpapers, you can't use it any longer.

34:07.997 --> 34:08.217
Or anymore.

34:08.237 --> 34:08.638
Get another picture.

34:08.658 --> 34:09.619
Just hold it like that.

34:09.639 --> 34:09.739
Yeah.

34:10.630 --> 34:34.745
Can you just hold it like that?

34:34.765 --> 34:34.865
Yeah.

34:34.885 --> 34:34.985
Okay.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.067
So, this was roughly a description about our section.

34:36.087 --> 34:36.267
So, okay.

34:36.517 --> 34:37.859
What do you want to see more?

34:38.399 --> 34:39.120
Bindery?

34:39.581 --> 34:40.021
Microfilling?

34:40.041 --> 34:41.603
Whatever you got.

34:42.124 --> 34:42.224
Yeah.

34:42.404 --> 34:42.504
Okay.

34:42.745 --> 34:44.807
You want to use the board in the basement.

34:45.188 --> 34:45.368
Uh-huh.

34:45.388 --> 34:47.530
And then it works for better.

34:48.211 --> 34:48.592
Really?

34:48.892 --> 34:49.433
Yes, really.

34:49.513 --> 34:53.057
And a few years ago, we discovered it again.

34:53.157 --> 34:58.724
And then the others here in the workshop just... Was this building badly damaged?

34:58.844 --> 35:01.227
No, unfortunately not.

35:01.247 --> 35:02.989
Just one shelf.

35:03.009 --> 35:03.109
Good.

35:03.370 --> 35:04.010
Just one shelf.

35:04.551 --> 35:06.253
The damage was more.

35:06.757 --> 35:33.359
Do you use microfilm as a form of preservation or is it just something else?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.342
Microfilm is not part of the preservation process at all.

35:37.030 --> 35:41.175
But afterwards, when the book is finished, before we bind it... You make a copy.

35:41.255 --> 35:42.397
We make a copy.

35:42.417 --> 35:45.200
It's now a really good opportunity.

35:47.363 --> 35:52.609
So everything that is processed out, then you have a microphone copy made.

35:52.629 --> 35:53.270
Yeah, yeah.

35:53.991 --> 35:57.015
This is our only.

35:57.035 --> 35:57.756
You have both.

36:02.201 --> 36:02.802
Okay, good.

36:04.469 --> 36:07.654
You don't scan digitally, you do microfilm.

36:07.674 --> 36:13.722
Yeah, we don't scan it.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.705
So microfilm is still the best way?

36:20.151 --> 36:24.577
Yeah, because the digitalization techniques are changing too often.

36:24.638 --> 36:28.763
It's not certain.

36:28.783 --> 36:29.945
Well, that's very interesting.

36:29.985 --> 36:33.430
Some places I've visited in the United States, of course, are

36:33.595 --> 36:36.238
But they can't tell you whether or not it will last forever.

36:36.318 --> 36:37.119
You know, they don't know.

36:37.159 --> 36:39.021
So this is probably the best.

36:39.101 --> 36:41.343
Everybody says microfilm, we still know what it does.

36:42.204 --> 36:43.906
So you do the shooting in here too?

36:44.406 --> 36:48.811
This is where you shoot the pictures for the microfilm?

36:49.131 --> 36:51.434
In this room here or over there?

36:51.454 --> 36:53.195
Sure, yeah.

36:53.215 --> 36:55.558
Uh-huh, good.

36:55.598 --> 36:55.858
Next.

36:56.138 --> 36:58.501
What do you think about masthiasification?

36:58.521 --> 36:59.362
The which?

36:59.382 --> 37:00.743
Masthiasification?

37:01.464 --> 37:01.764
Yes.

37:01.784 --> 37:02.445
The acidification.

37:02.685 --> 37:03.366
Yeah.

37:04.628 --> 37:07.192
Massive acidification.

37:07.212 --> 37:11.177
This is separate, totally separate from the other unit that we just saw, right?

37:11.198 --> 37:12.379
Totally separate, yeah.

37:12.399 --> 37:13.301
Uh-huh.

37:13.321 --> 37:19.029
You will get a description, a printed description about it, because I'm not so familiar with the technique.

37:19.990 --> 37:24.537
But you should get to know it, like, on your own eyes, with your own eyes.

37:24.877 --> 37:25.398
Okay, yes.

37:25.418 --> 37:25.658
Okay.

37:26.279 --> 37:26.980
Oh, look at this.

37:27.141 --> 37:27.441
Wow.

37:27.842 --> 37:29.584
Okay.

37:30.245 --> 37:30.906
Okay.

37:31.443 --> 37:38.834
This is a large tube.

37:39.254 --> 37:44.642
And in this tube, our deacification process will take place.

37:44.862 --> 37:50.150
Therefore, the books are packed.

37:50.190 --> 37:52.633
Put it in this wagons.

37:52.653 --> 37:54.516
Baskets, almost, yeah.

37:55.097 --> 37:56.098
Whatever, wagons.

37:56.519 --> 37:58.061
It's like a trail.

37:58.081 --> 38:00.825
It comes here, like...

38:01.008 --> 38:07.537
Like a ship, then you kind of slide it in the tube.

38:07.557 --> 38:07.817
Okay.

38:08.578 --> 38:12.604
Then you cover it, so it clearly, you cover it.

38:14.487 --> 38:14.967
You lock it.

38:15.388 --> 38:15.929
You lock it.

38:15.949 --> 38:21.777
And then how long does it kind of slide through the whole process?

38:23.199 --> 38:23.900
Yeah.

38:23.920 --> 38:28.846
Three until four hours.

38:29.167 --> 38:29.968
Ah.

38:31.163 --> 38:32.304
Four hours for each.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.067
How many of these can you put in there at a time?

38:36.387 --> 38:43.373
Two wagons.

38:45.876 --> 38:47.757
This is one wagon, this is two wagons.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.479
So two of these at a time.

38:49.539 --> 38:53.202
Each has four baskets, so about eight baskets.

38:53.602 --> 38:55.644
And how many books can you get in each one?

38:56.405 --> 38:58.847
We don't count the books, we count the weight.

38:59.667 --> 39:00.428
This is two.

39:00.982 --> 39:03.426
About 70 kilos.

39:04.328 --> 39:05.170
About 70 kilos.

39:05.190 --> 39:07.414
Because we have small, large, and so on.

39:09.598 --> 39:10.580
About 70 kilos.

39:10.920 --> 39:11.461
Altogether.

39:13.244 --> 39:14.988
Both.

39:15.128 --> 39:15.669
Two wagons.

39:15.909 --> 39:17.132
Equals 70 kilos.

39:17.492 --> 39:18.835
Okay.

39:20.077 --> 39:22.682
Now these are books that go in, like these books over here?

39:24.024 --> 39:24.525
Yeah, yeah.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.785
These are the kinds of books that go in?

39:27.945 --> 39:29.229
Yeah.

39:29.469 --> 39:33.920
Do you open them up or you just put them in the... Yeah.

39:33.940 --> 39:34.902
You just take a book?

39:36.286 --> 39:36.486
No.

39:38.531 --> 39:42.160
It comes... You don't charge to select it.

39:42.747 --> 39:50.958
I understand, but when you take a book to put it in, do you have to open it up and fan the pages, or you just take the book and put it in the basket?

39:51.439 --> 39:52.921
We just take it in.

39:53.081 --> 39:54.703
We leave it shut.

39:54.743 --> 39:56.646
Ah, okay, that's my question.

39:56.666 --> 40:02.093
It's not necessary to open it, but we have to select... The size and that kind of thing.

40:02.253 --> 40:12.687
Yeah, but something on the cover which is not... It can make it difficult, but the majority...

40:13.072 --> 40:18.219
I think 95% it's possible to deal it with the plant.

40:18.239 --> 40:19.761
Oh, it is in 1968.

40:19.841 --> 40:20.081
Yeah.

40:21.063 --> 40:24.147
Only 30 years old, and yet they already have to be.

40:24.207 --> 40:25.789
Yes, this is the point.

40:26.210 --> 40:33.480
This plant can keep the condition on the moment.

40:34.221 --> 40:38.046
Like the condition of this moment, we can keep it.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.931
But the books we have upstairs...

40:42.046 --> 40:49.513
They are in a so bad condition, so we have to do more.

40:49.853 --> 40:53.416
But this plant stops aging.

40:53.456 --> 40:55.358
This is before it gets really bad.

40:55.738 --> 40:56.619
Yeah, yeah.

40:56.639 --> 40:59.242
So we are satisfied with the condition we have.

41:01.403 --> 41:02.244
Yes, yes, I do.

41:02.625 --> 41:10.872
And for the cashmology, what?

41:11.206 --> 41:14.670
And then it starts with heating and vacuum.

41:14.911 --> 41:16.452
We call it fort fortnam.

41:16.512 --> 41:18.735
We call it make a try.

41:19.216 --> 41:19.857
Make a try.

41:22.620 --> 41:23.441
Say it again slow?

41:23.721 --> 41:28.908
Yes, I want to describe it because I don't know the real word, the proper word in English.

41:28.928 --> 41:29.989
So what's the German word?

41:30.510 --> 41:31.291
Fort fortnam.

41:31.311 --> 41:32.472
Fort fortnam.

41:34.763 --> 41:36.746
And I'll take a picture while you're doing that.

41:37.106 --> 41:37.447
Okay.

41:37.827 --> 41:39.770
Pre-drying.

41:40.131 --> 41:40.872
Yes, pre-drying.

41:41.112 --> 41:45.138
It means paper normally contains water.

41:45.218 --> 41:49.724
Like in a 6, 7, 8% of water.

41:50.485 --> 41:51.807
If the paper is healthy.

41:53.770 --> 41:54.311
Okay.

41:54.331 --> 41:57.976
As more healthy a paper, as more water can contain.

41:58.717 --> 42:02.863
And we make it more dry under about 1%.

42:03.417 --> 42:05.299
So the paper is really, really trying.

42:05.759 --> 42:12.426
And we want to have the paper in this concession because then it will be soft, everything it can get.

42:13.567 --> 42:26.961
And after the tube is locked, the other solution, it's a water-free solution, an alcoholic solution, without any water.

42:27.761 --> 42:33.407
And the alcoholic solution contains the alkaline buffer and the alkaline

42:34.282 --> 43:03.327
chemical now the paper is so dry so it's socked in socked in and in this moment if the solution is in the alkaline chemical starts to work neutralize neutralize the acid in the paper and leave the salt now if the book is closed how does it get to every page yeah this is because it's very very dry you can't

43:04.117 --> 43:06.700
Normally, you can't find the paper so dry.

43:08.863 --> 43:15.331
From 7% water, under 1% water.

43:15.851 --> 43:16.973
It's very, very present.

43:16.993 --> 43:19.436
So you do that in there, it makes it dry in there?

43:20.157 --> 43:20.397
Yes.

43:21.078 --> 43:22.980
The whole process is in the tube?

43:23.260 --> 43:24.983
The whole process is in one tube.

43:25.223 --> 43:25.503
I see.

43:25.703 --> 43:26.304
In one tube.

43:26.564 --> 43:33.533
We lock it, and then we start with drying, and then we add, then we add

43:33.952 --> 43:37.857
The solution fluttered, defluttered the tube.

43:38.838 --> 43:45.846
Solution comes to the fiber in each corner of the book, in the middle of the book, in a few minutes.

43:45.927 --> 43:47.789
It takes, it needs a few minutes.

43:47.969 --> 43:55.078
Afterwards, it comes out, it goes away.

43:55.859 --> 43:58.222
So it goes in this side, comes out the other side?

43:58.262 --> 44:02.727
Yeah, the solution comes in a circle.

44:04.698 --> 44:08.564
Morning, Professor, how are you?

44:08.645 --> 44:09.406
Here we are again.

44:09.426 --> 44:10.708
Nice to see you.

44:10.728 --> 44:11.169
Excellent.

44:12.451 --> 44:13.353
You have seen the other?

44:13.573 --> 44:14.875
Yes, yes, yes.

44:15.857 --> 44:17.239
Very fascinating.

44:18.902 --> 44:20.004
It is, yes.

44:21.306 --> 44:24.852
He's giving me an excellent introduction, Henrik.

44:25.793 --> 44:30.942
And the very important thing is it's not just a laboratory,

44:31.208 --> 44:46.606
It's a real, it's a routine work so that we have behind us all the developments so that we really can produce mass de-extricated paper.

44:47.267 --> 44:58.600
And this is the combination you have seen with the paper splitting machine and the mass de-extrication and the microfilming, we have really a bundle of

44:58.985 --> 45:03.112
Different techniques, approaches or whatever.

45:03.152 --> 45:04.855
To have an option.

45:04.976 --> 45:09.924
You cannot preserve things just with one method.

45:09.944 --> 45:10.806
That's impossible.

45:11.707 --> 45:13.230
Books have different...

45:13.750 --> 45:20.059
life cycles, and so you have to decide what you want to use.

45:20.119 --> 45:21.361
These are not so bad.

45:21.761 --> 45:24.044
These books, I was noticing these are 1968.

45:24.365 --> 45:28.831
They are nearly in as bad a condition as the ones I saw upstairs.

45:29.212 --> 45:32.216
So therefore they can have a different technique here.

45:32.697 --> 45:34.719
I'm amazed that you don't have to open the pages.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.462
You can just put the book in like that.

45:36.963 --> 45:39.726
How about, does this maintain the strength too?

45:39.947 --> 45:40.888
Is this...

45:41.054 --> 45:43.397
So this is not a strengthening process.

45:45.280 --> 45:50.167
We are on the way to combine both.

45:50.347 --> 45:53.532
If you come back in a year, I think... That's the tough one, isn't it?

45:53.552 --> 45:54.954
Everybody is having a hard time.

45:55.074 --> 45:58.719
So is that being worked on?

45:59.881 --> 46:00.762
Is that being developed?

46:01.443 --> 46:10.015
It's on developing, so that we will combine those things and this will be then the solution.

46:10.737 --> 46:14.041
Very impressive, really.

46:14.061 --> 46:15.302
Yeah, we are quite proud about it.

46:15.322 --> 46:17.505
Yeah, we should be, yes.

46:17.685 --> 46:23.372
Professor, how many volumes a year do you try and think you can do?

46:23.392 --> 46:29.419
At the moment, we have just one shift, so we have 200,000 per year.

46:29.439 --> 46:31.761
200,000 books?

46:31.821 --> 46:32.622
Books, yeah.

46:32.823 --> 46:38.449
And if you have two shifts, you can have 400,000, but...

46:38.750 --> 46:44.222
Until now, we don't have the capacity in the... 200,000 books a year, that's why.

46:45.325 --> 46:46.207
But that's not enough.

46:47.269 --> 46:48.973
It's not enough.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.777
That's a million every five years.

46:51.178 --> 46:58.193
Yeah, but on the other side, we have an income of 300,000 volumes per year.

46:58.426 --> 46:59.728
So you're behind.

47:00.209 --> 47:01.130
Yeah, we are behind.

47:02.552 --> 47:07.800
In the meantime, the exit-free paper is growing in books.

47:07.901 --> 47:11.486
I think it's about now 70% or about this.

47:11.506 --> 47:17.495
So we have not to repair everything that's coming in, but 200,000 is not enough.

47:17.836 --> 47:19.338
So there are two ideas.

47:19.719 --> 47:24.366
One is to have two ships, and the other is to...

47:24.802 --> 47:31.175
enlarge or to enhance the capacity by another tube.

47:31.195 --> 47:35.865
Now, the process I saw upstairs, that does strengthen the pages.

47:36.185 --> 47:38.289
You have the core sheet.

47:38.310 --> 47:42.979
So that strengthens this, unfortunately, does not add any...
