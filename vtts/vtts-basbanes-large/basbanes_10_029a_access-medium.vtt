WEBVTT

00:05.127 --> 00:06.570
The cards will be wonderful.

00:07.392 --> 00:12.965
Excellent.

00:12.985 --> 00:13.346
Excellent.

00:18.257 --> 00:18.458
Thank you.

00:18.478 --> 00:19.320
This is Paul Hackett.

00:19.921 --> 00:20.181
Paul.

00:21.705 --> 00:22.346
Nick Brasbane.

00:22.427 --> 00:23.710
Pleasure to meet you.

00:23.730 --> 00:24.351
Nice to meet you.

00:25.057 --> 00:27.660
Tell me, Gene, where we are.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.982
What is this place?

00:29.843 --> 00:33.447
This place is called Himalayan Indian Resources.

00:33.928 --> 00:37.953
It's a project of the Trace Foundation.

00:38.033 --> 00:39.295
I was in the U.S.

00:46.304 --> 00:53.933
government service working for the Library of Congress.

00:54.217 --> 00:58.784
Chiefly, first in India, then in Indonesia, then in Egypt.

01:00.026 --> 01:03.731
And the purpose was to... Can you give me the years that you did this?

01:03.751 --> 01:05.714
19... I started in 1968.

01:05.834 --> 01:11.843
I worked for the Library of Congress.

01:12.344 --> 01:15.769
I worked through... I just retired in 94.

01:15.949 --> 01:16.911
Or 97, sorry.

01:16.971 --> 01:17.251
Okay.

01:17.271 --> 01:20.376
While I was in India...

01:20.845 --> 01:42.274
we had access to the public law, the authority rupees, and one of the projects was to produce Tibetan books in various formats, because the refugees had just started to come out from China, and there had been a lot of damage at that time and during the Cultural Revolution.

01:42.795 --> 01:44.878
So what we did... They were carrying books with them?

01:44.898 --> 01:46.200
Yes.

01:46.220 --> 01:48.983
And so we tried to... Print.

01:49.003 --> 01:50.245
Everything that...

01:50.697 --> 01:51.398
that we could find.

01:51.558 --> 01:56.324
Were they books from repositories, or were they some personal and private family collections?

01:56.344 --> 01:57.105
Personal.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.467
No, they just seized what they could.

01:58.987 --> 02:01.390
We tried to reconstruct the literature.

02:03.613 --> 02:08.499
Was this a formal project, or was it... Well, I was trying to... Well, it was a project on my own.

02:08.679 --> 02:10.321
And you were based where, when this was going on?

02:10.341 --> 02:10.562
In Delhi.

02:10.582 --> 02:10.862
In Delhi.

02:11.082 --> 02:12.164
So you were doing this in Delhi?

02:12.364 --> 02:12.464
Yeah.

02:12.884 --> 02:15.748
Excellent.

02:15.768 --> 02:16.949
That's a reference.

02:16.969 --> 02:17.170
Excellent.

02:17.190 --> 02:17.430
Thank you.

02:18.575 --> 02:21.638
I was working in the library in Dharamsala.

02:22.059 --> 02:22.199
Uh-huh.

02:22.219 --> 02:23.260
We've been friends how many years?

02:23.280 --> 02:26.264
30 years.

02:26.444 --> 02:27.064
Yeah.

02:27.365 --> 02:37.796
Taki, how do you pronounce your last name?

02:38.998 --> 02:43.823
T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-

02:45.119 --> 02:53.390
And the idea was that they would then make copies available to the West, but they would also try to preserve their literature for themselves.

02:53.971 --> 02:55.273
That was not so successful.

02:56.594 --> 02:56.835
Right?

02:57.135 --> 02:57.536
Which one?

02:57.616 --> 02:58.016
All of it?

02:58.036 --> 02:59.358
All of the above or the latter?

02:59.478 --> 03:11.174
Well, you know, we certainly got a lot of books here, but many of them were printed in a very short number of copies and were not really distributed as widely as they should have been in the Tibetan community.

03:13.077 --> 03:14.198
This is, for example...

03:16.135 --> 03:23.384
A scholar who lived from the 13th to 1451 decided to put together all of knowledge.

03:23.564 --> 03:24.085
And his name?

03:24.345 --> 03:26.608
It was Bodong Chole Namgau.

03:26.828 --> 03:31.054
Is there something that we could spell or get a xerox of a title page or something?

03:31.895 --> 03:33.377
Yes, yes.

03:33.397 --> 03:35.980
Encyclopedia Tibetica, the collective works.

03:36.821 --> 03:42.328
And so he put together whatever he thought was worth knowing.

03:43.135 --> 04:07.708
now that's what you say and uh into a compendium of uh existence that's a compendium of what of uh deny of existence how would you translate deny existence existence existence right existence of everything a compendium of existence yeah the putting together of

04:08.650 --> 04:29.241
all of uh phenomenons yeah existence phenomena existence phenomena in the world or in today no no in terms of what there was at a platonic level what there was worth worthy of knowledge and this was one of the bigger projects how many volumes i see there's a hundred and i don't know thirty seven

04:29.356 --> 04:31.339
And these were published where?

04:31.359 --> 04:32.200
In New Delhi.

04:32.260 --> 04:33.642
These were published in New Delhi?

04:33.662 --> 04:36.566
By Tibet House.

04:36.586 --> 04:38.128
From material that was brought out?

04:38.208 --> 04:39.610
By refugees.

04:39.630 --> 04:40.051
Really?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.134
These came from a monastery.

04:42.154 --> 04:43.355
Many of the volumes were lost.

04:44.917 --> 04:50.064
So it's not complete, but it's all that survives of this collection.

04:50.084 --> 04:50.165
Wow.

04:51.046 --> 04:54.971
You don't think that there's a mirror copy in Tibet?

04:54.991 --> 04:55.492
Unlikely.

04:55.532 --> 04:58.536
They want to come here, and now they're coming here to make copies.

04:59.022 --> 05:03.847
So is this stuff being systematically destroyed, do you think, in Tibet?

05:05.169 --> 05:05.689
Well, yes.

05:05.729 --> 05:08.212
During the Cultural Revolution, it was really very bad.

05:09.453 --> 05:15.941
Now what's happening is it's the tourists who are destroying things.

05:15.961 --> 05:20.906
For example, here are things you can buy around the bar corps.

05:22.047 --> 05:23.789
Around the where?

05:23.929 --> 05:25.952
Around the central cathedral of Lhasa.

05:27.013 --> 05:28.995
These are blocks.

05:29.988 --> 05:31.970
for printing books.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.031
They're woodblocks?

05:33.051 --> 05:33.251
Yes.

05:35.734 --> 05:44.282
And this is, uh, this is now impossible to print anymore from because somebody bought us a page of it.

05:45.563 --> 05:47.145
I mean, who's going to carve that again?

05:48.446 --> 05:49.868
This is circa what, would you say?

05:50.608 --> 05:55.954
Uh, this we know was carved in about, probably, it's the D.C.

05:56.034 --> 05:56.434
somewhere.

05:56.735 --> 05:57.823
1680s.

05:57.843 --> 05:59.917
1680s.

06:00.078 --> 06:02.374
This is over 300 years old.

06:03.029 --> 06:03.810
And what do you call it?

06:03.850 --> 06:05.413
What is the formal name for it again?

06:05.513 --> 06:06.855
Is there a name for it?

06:07.136 --> 06:08.137
A woodblock.

06:08.177 --> 06:11.783
A woodblock from which text would be printed, right?

06:12.204 --> 06:12.925
Yeah.

06:12.945 --> 06:15.489
They sell them for souvenirs in China.

06:15.790 --> 06:18.234
They just break up the entire thing and break up the whole library.

06:18.254 --> 06:19.196
And where were they from?

06:19.376 --> 06:20.438
They were kept in libraries?

06:20.478 --> 06:23.463
Yeah, they were kept in monasteries.

06:23.623 --> 06:24.625
Monastic presses?

06:24.645 --> 06:24.885
Yeah.

06:25.045 --> 06:27.990
And you would go in there and there would just be whole rooms, just walls.

06:28.207 --> 06:33.293
of nothing but these blocks, and they still print off of similar blocks in South Indian.

06:33.313 --> 06:35.636
I wouldn't mind getting a few photographs or something.

06:35.836 --> 06:37.058
We'll do it, yes.

06:37.078 --> 06:38.360
And you know, the whole lot is needed.

06:38.380 --> 06:42.525
If they weren't birthed during the Cultural Revolution, like I said, they're sold as souvenirs.

06:42.585 --> 06:44.908
I'll just give you the name again for the tape recorder.

06:45.168 --> 06:46.189
Who's your name?

06:46.209 --> 06:47.651
My name is Paul Hackett.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.293
H-A-C-K-E-T-T.

06:49.373 --> 06:50.755
Fortunately, we know

06:51.190 --> 06:55.239
the book it's from, and we had published the book, the page.

06:55.259 --> 06:58.766
What's the page number on that?

06:58.787 --> 07:01.332
It's page... So this is a page.

07:01.392 --> 07:10.532
It's a long... It's about three inches wide by perhaps a... It's hard to tell.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.621
Right here.

07:12.701 --> 07:15.125
Careful.

07:15.146 --> 07:25.663
Gene, do you mind if I take a few photographs while I'm here?

07:25.804 --> 07:32.014
I can't quite make it out.

07:33.243 --> 07:43.335
Oh, I just got the lung on that.

07:43.735 --> 07:56.190
You have to print it in reverse, right?

07:56.491 --> 07:58.012
He made an impression in his thumb.

07:58.113 --> 08:01.917
What is it?

08:02.251 --> 08:31.026
Say that again?

08:32.204 --> 08:34.029
This book, which book can never be printed again?

08:34.852 --> 08:35.774
This one.

08:35.814 --> 08:36.958
Like this.

08:36.978 --> 08:38.863
So how many blocks of these were going on these?

08:38.923 --> 08:39.746
Here you go.

08:39.786 --> 08:40.427
Here's the page.

08:40.448 --> 08:41.009
Oh, come on.

08:41.611 --> 08:41.992
Here you go.

08:43.135 --> 08:45.201
Don't go away.

08:46.008 --> 09:10.193
and this was this block that's the page that's the page it was it was how did you find that so well there's the patient on the block these were amazing yeah now it's the only hat uh so to get the picture right

09:10.460 --> 09:15.187
You'd have to have both, you'd have to have the block be proceeding as they make it an EU.

09:15.207 --> 09:16.829
This is what's tragic about it.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.431
What happens is extraordinarily tragic.

09:18.451 --> 09:19.453
And this is from which book?

09:19.473 --> 09:23.879
Is this the same book, the same cyclopedia that we were talking about?

09:23.979 --> 09:24.560
No, no.

09:24.740 --> 09:26.423
This book is called The White Barrel.

09:26.823 --> 09:29.347
The White Barrel, it translates to White Barrel.

09:29.367 --> 09:29.547
Right.

09:29.567 --> 09:32.451
So if I give you a card book, it's 20 minutes.

09:32.954 --> 09:54.203
so you know because we have this but you notice look at what's happening this book since 1972 it's already

09:55.060 --> 09:57.384
have the way to the destruction.

09:59.447 --> 10:03.173
Because the paper is highly acidic.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.135
South India?

10:04.375 --> 10:05.878
South India.

10:06.178 --> 10:07.000
Badly produced.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.045
I can show you much worse.

10:11.587 --> 10:16.716
How would you describe the content of what we would have here?

10:16.776 --> 10:20.983
We also have the book.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.723
Anyway, how do we describe the what?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.606
How would you describe the content of this?

10:24.627 --> 10:43.883
This is used by the region of Tibet, and it's a standardized system of calculations of time, calendar, astrology, and this is very important.

10:44.048 --> 10:56.905
And that's when these blocks were produced.

10:57.105 --> 10:58.868
How many of these blocks do you have here?

10:59.328 --> 11:00.009
We just have two.

11:00.690 --> 11:01.551
How did you get them?

11:01.591 --> 11:04.875
I bought one as a young curator.

11:04.895 --> 11:06.057
I was so sad to see them.

11:06.307 --> 11:08.470
Everybody was buying it all around the Barcourt.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.232
The Barcourt is... How do you spell Barcourt?

11:10.412 --> 11:12.875
B-A-R-A-R-O-R.

11:14.397 --> 11:17.942
That's the pilgrimage route surrounding the Potala Palace.

11:17.962 --> 11:20.465
No, the Great Cathedral Plaza.

11:21.326 --> 11:27.694
And it just made me very sad and thought, well, we were having a visit from some Chinese delegates.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.496
I thought, well, maybe I could help.

11:29.982 --> 11:34.667
But, you know, they have no control of them because it's under one faction.

11:35.869 --> 11:39.693
So have these monastic libraries been plundered for these things?

11:40.033 --> 11:40.534
What's happened?

11:40.554 --> 11:42.156
Nobody's taking care of them?

11:42.296 --> 11:44.398
There's no curatorial staff there?

11:44.418 --> 11:47.582
No, but the blocks, you see, were in the printing press.

11:48.062 --> 11:49.264
And the printing press collapsed.

11:50.325 --> 11:57.393
It's what's called the old printerie, a plaza, of the chur, and it collapsed.

11:57.433 --> 11:58.234
So the blocks...

11:59.159 --> 12:00.140
Many of them were broken.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.002
And when did this happen, approximately?

12:02.042 --> 12:03.184
Happened a few years ago.

12:03.664 --> 12:06.207
You know, nobody was using them.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.530
Many of them were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

12:09.011 --> 12:11.394
This is horrible.

12:13.055 --> 12:23.648
So the idea was, it was a stop-gas salvage operation, basically, to try to get them published in a form that they could be used.

12:23.982 --> 12:30.950
by scholars, both Tibetan, Chinese, wherever we could use them, and Western.

12:31.671 --> 12:38.860
So what we did was, the first idea was to print them in Western book form, because Tibetan books are loosely.

12:40.562 --> 12:49.773
And if you get them in a library, and somebody puts them down in the chute, then you have to put them back together.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.116
Let's take an interesting one.

12:56.146 --> 12:59.272
Here's one unwrapped.

12:59.292 --> 12:59.432
Okay.

13:00.795 --> 13:01.517
So you just read them.

13:02.799 --> 13:05.925
So for each page there were two blocks, the front side and the back side.

13:06.065 --> 13:07.608
Is this something recently printed?

13:07.749 --> 13:09.733
Yeah, this is recently printed.

13:09.753 --> 13:14.943
Now is that floxing already that we see or is that just something, is this acidic paper do you think?

13:15.023 --> 13:17.568
Oh yeah, it's all from India.

13:17.608 --> 13:18.610
Acid free paper is not

13:18.590 --> 13:23.436
So you can see it's already having, it's already deteriorating.

13:23.456 --> 13:26.479
You can see the back side of it.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.262
And so then these are like fastened together.

13:29.302 --> 13:33.507
No, they're wrapped around in cloths with boards.

13:34.869 --> 13:36.430
Here's an example of an original.

13:36.971 --> 13:44.800
So the codex is not something that, this is not necessarily, we don't necessarily have a codex kind of a book, right?

13:45.556 --> 13:49.761
This is... Now, you're unwrapping a book out of a yellow... What do you call this cloth?

13:49.781 --> 13:50.783
Does it have a name?

13:50.803 --> 13:52.765
It's called a payday or a book wrapper.

13:53.366 --> 13:59.854
This is the first or the second known block print in the Tutaten work.

14:00.314 --> 14:09.386
It dates from the last decade of the 13th century.

14:09.406 --> 14:10.587
This copy here?

14:10.647 --> 14:12.550
No, the blue box for printing it.

14:12.570 --> 14:15.293
We don't know when it was printed, but it obviously is printed

14:15.695 --> 14:16.336
quite early.

14:19.079 --> 14:32.495
The blocks were carved at the time of the funeral rites of the Emperor Kublai Khan.

14:35.178 --> 14:45.330
It was badly damaged, but it has the name

14:46.154 --> 15:13.815
of the person who carved the blocks, and it was done for the... It says that it was done to fulfill the last thoughts, or requests, of the emperor, and to ensure the continuation of the realm of the queen and her children.

15:14.842 --> 15:44.157
uh and to help and for the benefit of all sentient creatures it was the blocks were carved at the instance of he would know who he was he was uh somebody has made a little note giving his full name uh how would you how would you spell that for me so i don't have to wrestle with this u-r-g-y-a-n-t-a he was the uh the pake or he was i'm sorry the

15:44.677 --> 15:51.710
The guru for this particular text, this is a Kala Chakra, the Wheel of Time text.

15:52.652 --> 16:02.591
And he gave the emperor the teaching and in return the widow felt that it would be appropriate that the blocks would be carved.

16:02.751 --> 16:04.795
This was carved in China.

16:05.197 --> 16:09.382
at the Imperial Court.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.805
Now, how do you know all of this about this particular book?

16:12.646 --> 16:14.188
Well, you can read it from them.

16:14.629 --> 16:17.712
But you learned this after you acquired this particular book?

16:17.873 --> 16:18.593
No, I knew what it was.

16:19.014 --> 16:20.296
We published it.

16:20.316 --> 16:20.896
So you published it.

16:20.916 --> 16:22.779
And how did you get this particular copy?

16:22.799 --> 16:25.602
Well, this is a different copy than the one we published.

16:25.919 --> 16:29.727
It was badly damaged, as you can see, and we've had it restored.

16:30.268 --> 16:36.561
But is this a copy that more or less successfully escaped the Cultural Revolution?

16:36.581 --> 16:40.610
Yes, but you see it's very badly damaged.

16:40.630 --> 16:41.772
It was water damaged.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.480
It was water damaged, and then it had to have to be fixed.

16:45.815 --> 16:48.058
You see, it's great.

16:48.618 --> 16:52.603
These are never bound in any kind of a traditional manner.

16:52.623 --> 16:57.029
No, you see, if you have anything in the library, somebody can always feel a sheet, a relief.

16:58.991 --> 17:00.714
So how do they protect against that?

17:00.994 --> 17:02.736
Do we have chained libraries?

17:02.856 --> 17:03.357
Oh, no.

17:03.377 --> 17:06.741
We have gay, wrathful librarians.

17:06.921 --> 17:08.643
Who wouldn't collaborate.

17:08.824 --> 17:10.105
Who was allowed to read these?

17:10.906 --> 17:14.691
Great llamas, like Duc Chin Chin.

17:15.025 --> 17:16.507
I wouldn't have been allowed to touch them.

17:19.751 --> 17:20.792
There's a lot of people in here.

17:20.812 --> 17:22.454
Now, what are the people who are here?

17:22.654 --> 17:25.077
These are from the Chase Party, most of them.

17:25.097 --> 17:31.805
Marty is head of his organization, or the vice chairman, what do you call him?

17:31.825 --> 17:32.345
Vice chairman?

17:32.365 --> 17:32.906
Vice president.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.708
Vice president of NITARTA.

17:35.609 --> 17:40.695
Now, this is what we did with printed books.

17:40.962 --> 17:45.409
It was the first stage in a salvation operation.

17:45.429 --> 17:49.275
Do you have a general number of how many printed books you might have been able to do this with?

17:49.295 --> 17:50.236
How many did we do it with?

17:50.256 --> 17:51.118
I can't remember.

17:51.298 --> 17:52.880
The PL480 collection?

17:52.940 --> 17:54.002
About 5,000.

17:54.022 --> 17:55.404
5,000 titles?

17:55.424 --> 17:57.407
5,000 volumes.

17:57.487 --> 18:01.193
About 80,000, 100,000 individual texts.

18:01.654 --> 18:05.620
For example, here, these are the collected works.

18:05.802 --> 18:18.462
of about 12 volumes but each volume could contain 20 30 40 50 texts and they were all just put together now you're printing these in a traditional codex form

18:18.830 --> 18:22.455
But you see, Tibetans don't like this.

18:22.736 --> 18:24.619
They like what you showed me.

18:26.542 --> 18:27.743
He wouldn't like to read that.

18:27.823 --> 18:30.748
Because here, for example, here's the front page, here's the back page.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.876
And this is almost like reading a newspaper and microfilm to us.

18:37.638 --> 18:42.205
Now, the next stage of the operation is the electronic.

18:42.472 --> 18:44.055
Okay, and that's what you're getting into now.

18:44.075 --> 18:54.998
And that's what Rinpoche and many of his associates are trying to do, is to input the text into machine-readable form, and then they can make copies on demand.

18:55.379 --> 19:00.008
These books here, are they here for the purpose of...

19:00.545 --> 19:28.864
being seated someplace to be to be placed someplace or is this a repository here it's repository you know for a while see if we know what we're testing it out but the idea is that uh for example which has come here today he's uh we i haven't met him for how many years since he was a young young monk how many years ago was that maybe in the 70s and where are you based now

19:29.114 --> 19:32.019
Mostly in Canada.

19:36.707 --> 19:42.236
But what he's doing now is a continuation, a logical continuation of this, through the electronic format.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.398
But he's come here today.

19:43.438 --> 19:46.543
He's found texts that are not accessible to him.

19:47.024 --> 19:49.468
And how long have you been doing this electronic format?

19:49.786 --> 19:50.868
Since 92.

19:52.170 --> 19:56.236
How important is what these people have done to your effort?

19:56.777 --> 20:02.426
Oh, it's very valuable.

20:02.446 --> 20:05.251
It's beyond the limit of benefit.

20:05.631 --> 20:07.054
Beyond limit.

20:07.154 --> 20:12.522
Because we have Gene's effort of having it being published.

20:14.125 --> 20:14.966
Using U.S.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.148
government excess

20:16.499 --> 20:37.883
agricultural commodities pre-o-480 yes public law 480 and the idea was that uh you could you could buy books we sold excess wheat to countries uh excess agricultural commodities and in return we got blocked currencies and these currencies can only be used

20:38.420 --> 20:41.547
for purchase, you know, various projects.

20:41.928 --> 20:44.915
And the law was amended in 59 to include book purchases.

20:44.935 --> 20:45.556
Book purchases.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.300
Who put that through?

20:47.500 --> 20:50.467
Some very wise congressmen.

20:50.527 --> 20:50.928
Amazing.

20:52.231 --> 20:54.977
I don't credit them with that kind of...

20:55.396 --> 20:57.058
I'm saying that, not you, but I'm amazed.

20:57.098 --> 21:04.369
Some of them are extremely knowledgeable, and people who, you know, I don't think we have that kind of, well, maybe we do.

21:04.389 --> 21:18.388
Yeah, I think, you know, just after the genius time, in the PFOA, the collection of books, and that's the first time actually Tibetan books were made available to our people outside Tibet, and refugees.

21:18.709 --> 21:19.850
That's the first time.

21:19.890 --> 21:24.036
Would you consider yourself an emigre community?

21:24.168 --> 21:28.133
Would you say that there are items here that are no longer in Tibet?

21:28.153 --> 21:32.799
Is it fair to assume that maybe these are the only copies of certain things?

21:32.839 --> 21:33.560
There's many of them.

21:33.921 --> 21:36.524
We've had recently people like Paldor.

21:36.584 --> 21:44.454
He comes from an organization which is in Chengdu, China.

21:44.634 --> 21:49.821
The Tibetans have two great collections of

21:50.172 --> 22:16.905
first the buddhist word which is called the conjurer how spell k-a-n that's about combat style or uh k-a-n-j-u-r say a-n-j-u-r there you are and that is the buddhist word translated into that that's 100 100 108 volumes wow and then you have

22:17.307 --> 22:22.134
the Tangur, which are the commentaries, T-A-N-J-U-R.

22:22.394 --> 22:29.784
These are the commentaries written by Indian scholars on things that are in the conjurer.

22:31.025 --> 22:37.594
These texts are, this amounts to about 230 some odd volumes, depending on the edition.

22:37.614 --> 22:43.182
It depends on the edition.

22:43.282 --> 22:43.562
240?

22:43.663 --> 22:44.023
214.

22:44.223 --> 22:48.530
Depends on .

22:53.338 --> 22:55.481
They were published in a number of places.

22:55.501 --> 22:56.843
There were a number of manuscripts.

22:58.065 --> 23:11.867
Now, because of the things that happened during the Cultural Revolution, in order to do a project of reprinting it in a critical edition, the editors of the—how would you translate—

23:12.539 --> 23:17.969
Comparative, Conjurer, Intangurer project in Critical Edition.

23:17.989 --> 23:19.051
I don't think it's Critical Edition.

23:22.358 --> 23:29.772
But they're producing Comparative Edition.

23:30.427 --> 23:31.148
No, this is Gene.

23:31.168 --> 23:31.688
This is Gene.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.189
Or this gentleman right here.

23:33.209 --> 23:34.871
This is General Poonloper.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.393
Do you have a card?

23:37.413 --> 23:39.175
Well, if you just write it down here.

23:39.275 --> 23:47.242
Anyway, what they're doing is... And your position and also your title and also where I can reach you by telephone if I have any other questions.

23:47.942 --> 23:48.563
I'm sorry, Gene.

23:50.144 --> 23:58.712
Oh, him?

23:59.013 --> 24:06.846
This is the word of the Buddha translated into Tibet.

24:07.006 --> 24:10.251
Now these are books that you printed from the material that was taken out.

24:11.033 --> 24:19.126
Almost everything you see here is the result of reproductions in India of books that were hand-carried out of Tibet.

24:19.506 --> 24:25.075
So when the Cultural Revolution was happening, everyone was carrying their books out and all the books were fleeing into exile.

24:25.095 --> 24:26.117
And everyone had their book.

24:26.300 --> 24:36.914
And when they reassembled in India, Nepal, and the refugee communities, people like Jim came from the Library of Congress and contacted them and said, we want to help reprint up because we have money to do this.

24:37.335 --> 24:37.675
I see.

24:38.056 --> 24:40.138
And managed to reproduce all of these.

24:40.859 --> 24:43.122
Now, these have been reproduced in a traditional fashion.

24:43.162 --> 24:43.743
Right.

24:43.763 --> 24:44.444
This is the conjurer.

24:44.464 --> 24:46.567
Now, let me show you what they're doing in China.

24:50.152 --> 24:51.533
This is the first volume.

24:52.295 --> 24:54.838
It's called the Beijing.

24:54.918 --> 24:55.699
They're doing this.

24:56.270 --> 24:57.571
And they're looking around.

24:58.692 --> 25:03.317
Here, let's get Paldor to show the product of his institution.

25:04.298 --> 25:04.478
Hello.

25:05.178 --> 25:05.799
This is Paldor.

25:05.879 --> 25:06.640
Here's Paldor.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.360
From Sichuan.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.101
He's from Chengdu.

25:08.441 --> 25:09.142
Uh-huh.

25:09.162 --> 25:10.343
And his organization.

25:10.403 --> 25:14.027
This is the first volume of the Tenggur.

25:14.207 --> 25:16.509
Oh, that's beautiful.

25:16.529 --> 25:17.290
That's done in China?

25:17.630 --> 25:18.511
This is done in China.

25:19.412 --> 25:20.573
And it's electronically done.

25:22.014 --> 25:26.158
So they have the variant readings from all of the different editions.

25:27.100 --> 25:30.645
Do we read in the traditional left to right?

25:30.805 --> 25:31.506
Yes.

25:32.507 --> 25:35.772
And this is a beautiful set.

25:35.792 --> 25:39.537
This contains two volumes.

25:40.498 --> 25:48.168
And there will be, of this tinder, there will be about a hundred and some odd volumes in this series.

25:49.010 --> 25:51.713
This is a description of it.

25:52.174 --> 25:54.277
This is being done by the People's Republic?

25:54.297 --> 25:54.777
Yes.

25:54.797 --> 25:54.998
Yes.

25:56.159 --> 25:56.820
And...

25:57.070 --> 25:57.551
Thank you.

25:58.712 --> 26:03.458
Paldor is, they have the electronic input that they produce.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.019
So that's very important.

26:05.059 --> 26:14.070
And Rinpoche is transferring skills that he's had, he's learned, to people like Paldor in China.

26:15.091 --> 26:18.675
So it's an international cooperation across boundaries.

26:19.256 --> 26:21.679
So when this ingathering started, you're still with L.C.

26:21.779 --> 26:22.180
at that point?

26:22.200 --> 26:22.720
Yes.

26:22.740 --> 26:23.962
I retired from L.C.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.103
a year ago.

26:26.078 --> 26:27.179
What was your title?

26:27.239 --> 26:33.907
I was the field director of first the New Delhi office, then the Jakarta office.

26:33.927 --> 26:37.010
I was nine years in Indonesia, two years in Cairo.

26:37.290 --> 26:44.478
LC is probably the only library in the world, a national library, that actually has field agents, would you say, working abroad.

26:44.579 --> 26:47.462
And was this ostensibly to gather material for LC?

26:47.682 --> 26:47.922
Yes.

26:48.763 --> 26:49.704
Please come and sit down.

26:55.210 --> 26:55.311
Okay.

26:55.331 --> 26:55.731
Wow, that's...

26:56.487 --> 27:04.798
Thanks.

27:05.198 --> 27:08.883
This is so nice.

27:08.903 --> 27:10.205
Where should I sit?

27:10.225 --> 27:25.144
Why don't you sit next to Rinpoche, because what's happening now is because of Rinpoche, and there's also Yeshi Michael Roach, who does a thing called Asian Classics Input Project.

27:25.799 --> 27:54.878
uh i don't know if you've met him well this is my first uh he's really they're soon to uh kim they're releasing the first uh the new guest i think that gloomington yeah the fourth uh edition of the basic desk but this is the way that's important i think for these studies to go tell me a little bit about the group that's gathered today this is uh well it's first i'm

27:55.769 --> 28:07.464
It's really Dzogchen Panlovermuche's friends, and Chimi, Chimi and Umuche and Tashi, are here using the library on their way to the Bloomington Conference.

28:09.487 --> 28:14.012
Oh, and also Karma.

28:14.032 --> 28:15.975
So this is a working library as well?

28:15.995 --> 28:16.095
Yeah.

28:18.258 --> 28:19.279
Used mainly by...

28:19.613 --> 28:33.535
scholars, Tibetan scholars, Western scholars, visitors from Europe, all over America, and graduate students, people who are researching.

28:34.657 --> 28:39.425
Is it fair to say that there are materials here that aren't available at major research libraries?

28:39.565 --> 28:43.832
It's fair to say that certainly part of the problem is that even though

28:44.032 --> 28:49.937
The Library of Congress had an overseas acquisitions program that's participated in by many academic libraries.

28:49.957 --> 28:53.060
The materials are completely uncataloged.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.902
No one knows these books may be fitting.

28:54.922 --> 29:02.109
For example, Cornell has a partial collection that is sitting in a warehouse in an apple orchard because no one can catalog them.

29:02.889 --> 29:03.590
I know about that.

29:03.670 --> 29:05.612
I'm writing about that apple orchard now.

29:05.632 --> 29:06.973
Are you?

29:07.193 --> 29:07.554
Oh, I am.

29:07.594 --> 29:13.279
Because Cornell has basically directed that no more than five million books can ever now be stored on Central Campus.

29:13.563 --> 29:16.907
And that will actually be in this section.

29:17.768 --> 29:25.298
I'm writing about their efforts to recede the Cambodian... Judy Ledgerwood.

29:25.858 --> 29:29.122
I haven't talked to Judy Ledgerwood, but she's there, right?

29:29.242 --> 29:31.365
I don't know where she is now.

29:31.485 --> 29:32.967
John Dean is who I've talked to.

29:32.987 --> 29:36.371
John Dean, and you should talk to John Badgley.

29:36.391 --> 29:39.435
He's now retired, sitting around someplace.

29:39.668 --> 29:42.031
John Badgley, right?

29:42.051 --> 29:45.937
Yeah, he was a curator of the Southeast Asian collection.

29:45.957 --> 29:49.822
Yes, and Mark Dimunation told me about it.

29:49.922 --> 29:53.628
I think we just went to L.C., by the way.

29:53.648 --> 29:58.234
You know, Mark Dimunation, D-I-M-U-N-A-I-T-I-O.

29:58.518 --> 30:03.604
But he just took the rare books job at night.

30:03.884 --> 30:07.889
He had that similar position at the time.

30:08.430 --> 30:10.593
He had some problems.

30:10.693 --> 30:14.337
It's a very risky job to take.

30:14.397 --> 30:17.561
A lot of people wouldn't take it.

30:17.621 --> 30:22.627
Should we take a little bit of this as it comes by?

30:23.228 --> 30:23.548
Probably.

30:23.588 --> 30:27.613
This looks wonderful.

30:32.183 --> 30:59.977
You might like to look at the unique artist site.

31:00.178 --> 31:02.140
I think it's interesting.

31:02.238 --> 31:04.640
Tibet can be displayed on the web.

31:05.201 --> 31:05.501
Really?

31:06.061 --> 31:07.302
Did you put the slide on here?

31:07.883 --> 31:10.245
Yes, it's in the cloud.

31:10.285 --> 31:10.945
Oh, too.

31:11.025 --> 31:13.728
Yeah, it is right there.

31:13.808 --> 31:14.428
There you go.

31:15.529 --> 31:18.872
And we do a lot of text input, like the hard copy.

31:19.372 --> 31:23.616
You do input into electronic.

31:23.896 --> 31:27.760
You know, maybe using like Microsoft Word.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.823
How long have you been in Canada?

31:32.140 --> 31:37.186
I've been traveling on and off for three, four years.

31:37.206 --> 31:39.649
And engaged in this project.

31:39.749 --> 31:40.910
How long are you in?

31:41.291 --> 31:43.093
We're mainly based in New York.

31:43.213 --> 31:48.178
And we've done a lot of work in Kathmandu, Nepal.

31:48.198 --> 31:51.222
Did you come to the shoot at your son?

31:51.242 --> 31:55.667
So far we've done like maybe 80,000 techniques.

31:56.221 --> 31:56.842
That's a lot.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.847
80,000.

32:00.608 --> 32:06.558
Now, are you scanning them in?

32:06.578 --> 32:07.319
How is it working?

32:07.420 --> 32:08.802
Are you keyboarding it in?

32:08.822 --> 32:09.703
How is it working?

32:09.884 --> 32:13.970
We have software programs that will kind of watch.

32:14.171 --> 32:17.436
Just identify yourself with a ticket.

32:17.657 --> 32:22.785
I'm Marty Marred from Natartha International.

32:23.272 --> 32:30.840
software programs written to output in Tibetan, on the screen or print in Tibetan.

32:31.601 --> 32:35.045
So you use standard PCs to input.

32:35.065 --> 32:46.017
Usually you have a keyboard translator that translates the Roman character keystrokes into the Tibetan characters they're equivalent to.

32:47.198 --> 32:51.102
And so you take the original text in Tibetan,

32:51.723 --> 33:07.982
And the inputter will read that and he will input it into his computer for either printing and hard copy or electronic distribution or searching and sorting in electronic format.

33:12.828 --> 33:21.578
How do you choose materials for this hand?

33:26.165 --> 33:33.113
Many of the texts are in demand in our community, Tibetan refugee community.

33:35.376 --> 33:37.559
Like these texts, some of them are out of print.

33:38.320 --> 33:44.567
We can't get any more copies, and some texts are not even printed for public.

33:44.627 --> 33:54.619
So we're trying to collect all the manuscripts and copies of the manuscripts from Tibet.

33:54.937 --> 33:59.743
and in India, that we have a historical record of it.

34:00.885 --> 34:09.576
Is the exile community, or the refugee community, basically in Canada, or is that just where you have the region?

34:09.616 --> 34:21.771
We have different refugees in Canada, in the United States, and the majority of our refugees in India.

34:22.105 --> 34:24.869
Yeah, I was born there.

34:26.131 --> 34:36.206
What's the important thing, I think, though, is that this will eventually transcend national boundaries, and it will be preservation of the Tibetan culture wherever it may be.

34:37.107 --> 34:50.948
In Bhutan, they have Tibetan culture, parts of which are not refugees in China, as well as among what I would call the diaspora.

34:51.569 --> 35:05.047
And there's an increasing number of Westerners who are interested in, scholars and practitioners, who are interested in the study of these Tibetan texts.

35:05.368 --> 35:15.281
So, you know, it's a, it has to be an international project without rancor.

35:16.903 --> 35:20.428
These are, I mean, you know, Tibetan...

35:20.763 --> 35:27.012
Academic tradition is very closely tied to the Indian development.

35:27.072 --> 35:31.618
So this is really 2,500 years of development of these texts.

35:31.718 --> 35:34.302
And it's a commentarial tradition.

35:35.404 --> 35:45.538
So the original commentaries and commentaries are sourced, you know, back to the great Indian philosophical ferments and those periods.

35:46.750 --> 35:53.160
So this is actually still a living tradition while the scholars are available who can read these texts.

35:53.180 --> 36:05.039
And eventually they're not only needed for scholars in those languages, but there's a lot of interest in being translated out of the languages.

36:05.059 --> 36:13.332
And they can, I believe, make valuable contributions to general scholarship.

36:13.970 --> 36:15.071
How important are computers?

36:15.391 --> 36:25.662
Are computers going to be the means to saving these ancient texts?

36:25.682 --> 36:37.214
I think it's very tricky because if you input everything in computer and don't save it properly, you can crash and lose all the data in an instant.

36:37.234 --> 36:43.521
But if you use it properly, I think it's very, very beneficial because there's a search capability in computer.

36:43.687 --> 36:52.797
And also, as Jean pointed out earlier, that you can make it available to people in any form you want, like in a book form or text.

36:53.457 --> 36:57.882
As you saw, the original Tibetan text format, we can do it in any format.

36:58.363 --> 37:06.031
And we're using Quark Express to make the Tibetan format, and we use also book format, too.

37:06.351 --> 37:11.837
So we go to this, I go to this website, and is all this material readily available?

37:12.728 --> 37:13.429
On the site?

37:14.370 --> 37:14.811
Not yet.

37:14.851 --> 37:16.113
It's a toy right now.

37:16.513 --> 37:18.176
Right now it's a toy.

37:18.196 --> 37:19.017
So when did you start then?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.680
This is just being started now?

37:20.740 --> 37:21.581
Is that what it is?

37:21.601 --> 37:22.823
The website?

37:22.963 --> 37:23.604
The website?

37:23.944 --> 37:24.605
Yeah, the website.

37:25.086 --> 37:26.929
The project started in 1992, 1993.

37:28.331 --> 37:33.258
But, you know, we're all based on volunteer basis we're working on right now.

37:34.219 --> 37:40.288
And so, you know, it's not, we can't produce as fast as we want.

37:40.505 --> 37:45.330
There's also technical limitations on putting Tibetan on the web.

37:45.690 --> 37:49.093
So it's actually the technology that makes it possible.

37:49.113 --> 37:51.235
It hasn't even been around for more than a couple of years.

37:52.376 --> 37:54.418
Do you mean the Tibetan characters?

37:54.879 --> 38:00.484
To display Tibetan on the web, because typically computers have been written in... Asking tool or whatever.

38:00.504 --> 38:01.285
Right, asking.

38:01.305 --> 38:10.073
So to actually be able to display and so on has only been possible recently with graphic-based and Windows-based.

38:11.015 --> 38:23.611
systems, that operating systems have been accessible with new breakthroughs and hybrid technology on the web, and there's still a lot of growing pains for this sort of display.

38:24.512 --> 38:28.858
Tell me, just again, what your involvement is with the project?

38:29.338 --> 38:30.179
I'm the vice president.

38:30.199 --> 38:38.490
I work with WIMSH and general counsel, and I'm a troubleshooter, but I mainly try and be an interface between

38:39.179 --> 38:53.258
And the scholars, Tibetan scholarly side, and the technical people, we employ technical people and scholars to try and support the scholarship with technology.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.280
You're in Canada as well?

38:55.701 --> 38:56.882
I'm in New York.

38:56.963 --> 38:58.505
You're in New York.

38:58.525 --> 39:00.287
You should tell something about the volunteer.

39:01.288 --> 39:03.351
I think Marty's a lawyer by trade.

39:04.412 --> 39:06.435
I'm pretty much.

39:06.601 --> 39:10.447
Right, I'm working full-time now, but I try it.

39:10.987 --> 39:17.076
I spent about a year and a half off to work entirely on the tartha matters with Rinpoche now.

39:17.176 --> 39:22.924
I take a month off here and there to work on that, but it's mainly volunteer support.

39:22.964 --> 39:35.983
And if you look at the whole development of Tibetan technology or technology that supports Tibetan language projects, it's been mostly created by volunteers doing it in their spare time, hackers.

39:36.132 --> 39:39.175
just hacking for Tibetan solutions in their spare time.

39:39.255 --> 39:42.578
So we don't have a lot of commercial interest behind this.

39:42.598 --> 39:43.880
You know, it's all altruistic.

39:43.940 --> 39:50.866
So gradually people are trying to develop standards so that they can make this into something universal.

39:50.946 --> 39:54.650
But right now it's sort of little people developing it on their own time.

39:54.690 --> 39:58.334
So if there's no commercial application, how is it supported?

39:58.894 --> 40:04.840
Well, there's no commercial application to create standards, but people can use commercial applications.

40:05.208 --> 40:28.920
add in Tibetan rules like we use Microsoft Word for instance and then you have to create a font that displays Tibetan and then you have to create it so it works in Word and you have to create a way to input the Tibetan characters from the actual ancient text itself into the word processing system and then you have to have a way for the

40:29.187 --> 40:36.135
computer to store that data and access that data even though it's not in ASCII or a romantic character and has a lot of weird things in it.

40:36.155 --> 40:38.438
So this is a whole technological ferment.

40:38.458 --> 40:42.142
I mean, the PC, you know, historically PCs are only 10 years old.

40:43.003 --> 40:49.450
So the PCs that are able to handle foreign languages are much younger even.

40:49.971 --> 40:56.618
And because the Asian market is growing, there's a greater capability of handling Asian characters.

40:57.119 --> 40:58.080
So that

40:58.347 --> 41:14.168
although it's not directly Tibetan, that language development does help in the development of Tibetan because you can piggyback on some of the things being done in Chinese, Japanese, which has a much greater commercial value.

41:14.188 --> 41:18.293
But there's still a lot of technical issues that haven't even been addressed yet.

41:18.313 --> 41:20.036
Sorry, Paul.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.460
For example, the fact that

41:23.542 --> 41:31.573
Because a lot of this is going on at the volunteer level, there are many different systems that have been devised which are nominally compatible.

41:32.654 --> 41:35.738
You need to have conversion facilities from one to another.

41:35.759 --> 41:46.253
There's the whole question of the long-term viability and preservation that's going on if you follow electronic archives for the U.S.

41:46.273 --> 41:47.254
government.

41:47.622 --> 41:53.714
electronic files from all of the NASA missions from the censuses.

41:53.774 --> 41:54.495
They're decaying.

41:54.515 --> 41:56.299
The records aren't even made together.

41:56.319 --> 41:56.719
Right.

41:56.739 --> 42:07.139
So, for example, the question is, I mean, these things, and we're talking 30, 20, 30, 40 years old, and this data, all the effort and money behind it, is completely inaccessible.

42:07.179 --> 42:09.223
You can't even read the tapes, or they snap.

42:09.243 --> 42:10.626
So there's...

42:11.011 --> 42:22.862
There's whole issues that need to be taken into account now, and this is one of the things that we're attempting to address, people are attempting to address, for example, with books that are being typeset, you know, what's happening to these files?

42:23.322 --> 42:29.408
Is there any efforts being made to preserve them, to, you know, just to make them available?

42:29.808 --> 42:37.896
And then in terms of just every individual organization, I mean, everyone maintains their backups and block one hoax.

42:38.568 --> 42:56.340
So the question of how these systems will interface in the long term and who's in charge of making sure that these files continue to exist, it sort of adds an additional level of ephemerality to the material that is ephemeral to begin with.

42:57.215 --> 43:00.679
Gene, is this an organization that you established when you left LCA?

43:00.739 --> 43:04.203
No, no, it's the project of the Trace Foundation.

43:04.524 --> 43:04.644
Okay.

43:04.824 --> 43:07.047
And maybe you should tell them a little bit about what this is.

43:07.227 --> 43:12.994
And Kim, why don't you say something about this?

43:14.997 --> 43:17.399
Yes, my name is Kim Morris, and I work with the Trace Foundation.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.462
If you could just spell your last name.

43:19.882 --> 43:24.488
M-O-R-R-I-S, like the cat.

43:24.518 --> 43:39.195
The foundation was established in 1993 by a young woman who decided to use funds that her father had invested for her as a child for this project, for Trace overall.

43:39.215 --> 43:49.547
She did projects in a number of other areas, but what interested her initially in Tibetan people and their culture was that she taught English in a school

43:50.017 --> 43:53.921
near a place called Cha Cha in Qinghai Province near Lake Kokonor.

43:54.201 --> 43:56.123
Do you want to give me her name?

43:56.143 --> 43:58.806
Her name is Andrea Soros.

43:58.826 --> 43:59.426
How do you spell it?

43:59.446 --> 44:03.170
Thank you.

44:03.230 --> 44:04.551
I know the name.

44:04.571 --> 44:15.021
She also taught English in a monastery in northern India and became pretty interested in the level of wealth of this culture and what it had to offer.

44:15.862 --> 44:17.644
So after another trip,

44:18.164 --> 44:26.533
into Tibetan areas in China, she decided that she would try to focus at least some of this funding on Tibetan communities there.

44:27.094 --> 44:41.270
And for the past two, three years, we've been primarily focusing on small development projects, rural development, such as schools, healthcare, teacher training, these sorts of things.

44:42.631 --> 44:44.273
And one of the things that

44:44.641 --> 45:02.198
we've been really pleased with is this idea of high art, Himalayan Inner Asia Resources, and that it could be used to bring people together at a time when there is a real resurgence of Tibetan literature, things being published, both modern works and also classical works.

45:02.879 --> 45:10.086
And there's frankly no better scholar to really work on the conception of this idea and bring it into being than Gene Smith.

45:10.106 --> 45:11.307
So he's really been helpful.

45:11.742 --> 45:14.985
for the last 18 months working with us on these ideas.

45:15.206 --> 45:19.330
So as you can see, people are here using the materials.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.532
It's a working place.

45:21.753 --> 45:28.780
And I think the thing that's of interest now is this idea of electronic libraries.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.882
This seems to be the place where people are going.

45:31.823 --> 45:35.087
And we can email our field staff in Tibet.

45:35.107 --> 45:40.112
I got an email the other day that they were watching World Cup soccer on the border of Nepal.

45:40.632 --> 45:43.637
And I couldn't do that two years ago if I sent people out into the field.

45:43.677 --> 45:46.120
I wouldn't hear for them for four or five weeks that are shot.

45:46.140 --> 45:51.669
So the computer is really changing the nature of Asia and its access to the West.

45:52.070 --> 46:03.467
And this is a really wonderful time for books that were brought into exile and have been spread throughout the world and the diaspora to be returned to people living in the borders of China.

46:03.616 --> 46:08.581
and also books that were reclaimed in China to be made accessible to people who live outside.

46:08.721 --> 46:09.562
And you're working on that, too?

46:09.582 --> 46:10.803
Well, we're beginning to explore it.

46:11.024 --> 46:25.699
That's what some of these meetings are about, and finding the people who are already working on these ideas, people who spent years like Xochitl Penelope's project and Michael Roach's project, ACIP, and lots of other people have this in mind.

46:26.299 --> 46:31.885
And what's really important is some of the aged lamas and teachers in these traditions

46:32.152 --> 46:44.402
They're growing quite old, and it's very important that some of this literature become available because the transmission of the religious tradition is done orally and by the written word, and they need the book.

46:45.924 --> 46:48.626
So is TRACE more or less the umbrella organization?

46:48.906 --> 46:50.227
We're the umbrella for the project.

46:50.348 --> 46:55.692
And maybe are there other projects that you're working on besides this, or is this a new project?

46:56.012 --> 46:57.814
This is one of the projects that we're working on.

46:57.834 --> 46:59.275
We think it's a very important one.

46:59.315 --> 47:01.517
It's still in formation.

47:02.105 --> 47:09.432
But we're very interested in improving the level of education.

47:09.452 --> 47:12.615
I mean, that could give you some more ideas of the projects that we're doing.

47:12.735 --> 47:17.019
I'd like to maybe pursue this later at another time.

47:17.039 --> 47:18.020
Sure.

47:18.860 --> 47:22.844
You can drop me a line by email.

47:25.807 --> 47:26.367
Kim Morris.

47:27.348 --> 47:28.309
I love email.

47:28.329 --> 47:29.530
At IBM.net.

47:29.898 --> 47:31.860
IBM.net.

47:31.880 --> 47:32.721
Tim Morris, one word.

47:33.302 --> 47:34.583
IBM.net.

47:34.803 --> 47:35.024
N-E-T.

47:35.264 --> 47:56.988
I think we should reiterate the necessity of getting the texts with the people who can transmit them, because, you know, Tibetan literature is dead if there's no transmission, and that explains the urgency.

47:57.548 --> 47:58.369
The lamas who

47:58.940 --> 48:07.713
who know about the text are rapidly disappearing through old age.

48:08.915 --> 48:20.834
And that's why it's so important that people like Dzogchen Rinpoche and Dzogchen Penlope and Chime, you know, they've been active in this and they understand the Western tradition.

48:20.854 --> 48:23.818
Chime for many years was at the British Library.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.664
And now there's a new sort of resurgence.

48:28.589 --> 48:37.238
in understanding that these teachings or these texts are not just dead texts, but they're living entities that have to have the transmission.

48:38.038 --> 48:49.510
So now what's happening is people are coming from Tibet, old lamas who know about the transmission, and giving the, what are called the lungs, or the L-U-N-G.

48:51.131 --> 48:52.353
Did you define that for me?

48:52.453 --> 48:55.316
Well, it's the reading of a text in somebody's presence.

48:56.197 --> 48:57.718
And then you've got trees.

48:58.947 --> 49:25.613
uh trees which are the explanation of the words and the uh substance of the text and finally the wands are the conferring of the initiations to practice a particular uh teaching and if you don't have these you know the the tradition it will die so you know it's broader than just books so what i'm missing here that

49:25.913 --> 49:28.917
This is not something that is accessible merely by reading.

49:29.037 --> 49:30.659
No.

49:30.679 --> 49:34.224
This is what the worst thing in any time is a word of loss.

49:34.244 --> 49:35.546
You have the wrong word.

49:36.247 --> 49:48.083
But what happens is if you find it to better take some fantastic thing, so you can do this, you can produce this with a baby or fruit or something like that, but you don't have the mango, and that's fortune.

49:48.323 --> 49:48.683
It's gone.

49:48.864 --> 49:53.710
And even if there's a mango, it works straight away.

49:54.382 --> 49:56.365
Is there any way that somebody could give me an example?

49:56.805 --> 49:59.189
Maybe this is hard, but what we're talking about?

49:59.209 --> 50:08.142
A very simple example, for example, that the way with Tibetan vocabulary, it's very genre-specific.

50:08.642 --> 50:19.478
So, for example, I've spent many years reading philosophical texts, but if I were to simply pick up a medical text or an astrology text or a text on grammar and linguistics,

50:20.150 --> 50:21.111
I wouldn't be able to read it.

50:21.252 --> 50:22.533
I don't know the vocabulary.

50:22.834 --> 50:24.937
A lot of the vocabulary is contextual.

50:25.357 --> 50:37.254
Many of the terms come from 7th, 8th, 9th century translation of Sanskrit materials, and it would be analogous to sitting down reading a 10th century English book.

50:37.955 --> 50:49.532
You can look at it, and you have dictionaries, but what the inner meaning was, how, and especially with a religious practice text, what it means in terms of application

50:49.850 --> 50:52.896
There's no way to derive that from the text itself.

50:53.216 --> 50:57.544
You need the oral commentary that's been handed down from teacher to student over thousands of years.

50:57.644 --> 51:01.491
So it's a tradition of a mentor and an apprentice?

51:01.531 --> 51:03.154
Is that a fair analogy?

51:03.375 --> 51:03.535
No.

51:03.655 --> 51:10.688
And you need the mentor to... Sometimes even just to read the text, let alone get an understanding of the inner meaning.

51:10.708 --> 51:11.229
Well, to read.

51:11.249 --> 51:13.393
I mean, I'm sure the...

51:13.745 --> 51:18.392
The alphabet doesn't change, but we're talking about reading in different levels of accessibility.

51:18.432 --> 51:20.375
And it's even taught within the tradition.

51:20.395 --> 51:27.585
As Jean pointed out, there's actual teachings of these three acts that are needed in order to read the text at a certain level of access.

51:27.646 --> 51:31.010
You can certainly read the text, you know, while you understand it.

51:31.732 --> 51:36.959
And, you know, certain parts of the tradition are supposedly transmitted entirely just by reading.

51:37.340 --> 51:42.908
But other texts and other parts of the tradition can only be

51:43.141 --> 51:49.350
understood fully with the commentary, with the explanation, and with the initiation.

51:49.831 --> 51:50.672
So it's different.

51:50.712 --> 51:51.914
It's hierarchical.

51:51.934 --> 51:52.615
It's leveraged.

51:52.635 --> 51:53.296
Was it formal?

51:53.316 --> 51:58.384
Was it a formal process of a student and a teacher, or is it religious?

51:58.404 --> 52:09.621
Is it secular and religious, or is it... Well, for example, you take one of the commonest texts, maybe,

52:09.854 --> 52:39.237
uh the madhyamika avatar the basic teaching of the madhyamaka you can you know you can read it the middle way you can read it by yourself you can do the commentary but a good tibetan teacher will say well before i'm going to teach you what the meaning is i'm going to read the thing in your presence just as my teacher has read it in my presence and his teacher before him has received it and so you you sit there

52:39.993 --> 52:42.757
while the teacher reads it to you.

52:44.059 --> 52:49.327
Now, this may sound strange, but this is what's called the lung.

52:49.347 --> 53:00.244
And then, only after he's given you the lung will he give you a tree on each word, or on the meaning, or something like that.

53:01.046 --> 53:04.411
That's an explanation.

53:04.551 --> 53:07.215
It's a different system of scholasticism.

53:08.191 --> 53:20.465
Maybe to us it may not seem very efficient, but for their system, I think it's quite efficient in a context, in the total context.

53:21.285 --> 53:23.768
You know, truth is only true within a context.

53:26.191 --> 53:29.615
So is this tradition in danger?

53:29.675 --> 53:34.981
Yes, because the looms, the people who have the looms, are dying.

53:35.261 --> 53:36.342
They're not being replaced?

53:36.777 --> 53:41.925
Yeah, but see, they're not passing them on because they don't have access to the book and the teacher.

53:43.889 --> 53:45.952
So you have to have a combination of the book?

53:45.972 --> 53:49.177
Assume that I'm totally ignorant of politics and world events.

53:50.039 --> 53:53.945
Well, I hope that you would never get a loom to Machiavelli.

53:56.510 --> 54:00.456
Explain for me why this is happening, why after so many hundreds of years...

54:02.140 --> 54:32.080
because of of the disasters that have happened to the the book the literary tradition and the people who have the access literature have become separated the books have have been destroyed a copy may exist in this monastery south of the himalayas the person who can pass on the tradition is north of the himalayas and there's a national boundary uh and so a person has to go around and say i want

54:32.566 --> 54:36.031
to get this particular teaching.

54:36.051 --> 54:42.881
And they may have to search all over to that to find somebody who can give it to them, or to find the book, even though they have somebody on the premises.

54:43.582 --> 54:48.870
So it's a union of the teacher with the book.

54:49.010 --> 54:56.982
And what's happened is the books, like we've got books here that have become separated for hundreds of years from the tradition.

54:57.423 --> 54:58.785
We can read them.

54:58.805 --> 55:00.227
We won't understand them.

55:00.308 --> 55:05.013
But just, it might happen that there might be somebody who can pass on that tradition.

55:05.033 --> 55:08.557
I think there seems to be a tradition.

55:08.577 --> 55:11.961
In Cambridge University, just say for my tape, who's speaking, okay?

55:12.222 --> 55:16.967
Sorry, I have voices off, and it's also mumbling my Englishes.

55:16.987 --> 55:27.799
In Cambridge University, there were students, and he wanted to preserve a thousand cultures, a thousand traditions, a thousand memories.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.062
He went into Hong Kong,

55:30.413 --> 55:40.803
and then he realized that the real person who had the Zoro Transformation is an old Chinese who lived in Cambridge.

55:40.823 --> 55:45.868
He escaped in the early times, and incredible.

55:45.888 --> 55:50.632
Then what happened is he had not only Daoism traditions, also Tibetan traditions.

55:50.692 --> 55:51.433
Daoism.

55:51.893 --> 55:52.794
Daoism.

55:53.094 --> 55:55.737
And also Tibetan traditions.

55:56.037 --> 55:56.978
Tibetan traditions.

55:57.312 --> 56:00.637
And he wore a black dress, he never changed any of his clothes.

56:00.717 --> 56:03.061
His sister said it's so difficult to go into it.

56:03.081 --> 56:07.568
And then, this child, finally, he starts making it from England.

56:07.608 --> 56:08.088
What do you get?

56:08.108 --> 56:10.111
All the thousands of texts in China.

56:11.834 --> 56:13.737
Same like this Tibetan thing now.

56:13.757 --> 56:15.760
What is the Rumbacharya?

56:16.145 --> 56:22.351
What Rinpoche's other people are doing is like this sort of a... So important is commentary.

56:22.371 --> 56:24.853
Think that you have the text that's not enough.

56:24.873 --> 56:26.354
You need to commentary on by that date.

56:26.374 --> 56:27.455
They're called consummation.

56:28.236 --> 56:33.401
So what kind of affirmative steps are you taking to restore this?

56:33.781 --> 56:35.382
Well, I think this is what he's doing.

56:35.462 --> 56:37.384
How will you get these teachers?

56:42.929 --> 56:46.152
How will you be able to get these people?

56:47.077 --> 56:50.981
who are so necessary to explain, to read the text.

56:51.061 --> 57:00.752
I was telling a story to Jim before you came.

57:00.812 --> 57:07.840
We have this specific commentary, the teaching, on Buddhist philosophy and the path of meditation.

57:10.683 --> 57:14.788
There was a person in Bhutan who had the transmission

57:15.258 --> 57:19.202
and who agreed to give us the transmission, but we couldn't find the text at that time.

57:19.943 --> 57:22.225
And so I got the text recently, like that.

57:22.766 --> 57:24.087
You got the text once or how?

57:24.207 --> 57:26.590
I got the text recently, two years ago.

57:27.191 --> 57:35.940
I got the text, and then by the time I got it, and he's already dead, you know, he died, he died with some sickness.

57:35.960 --> 57:40.945
So like that, you know, we are facing a lot of difficulties, and in danger of losing our transmission,

57:41.313 --> 57:44.718
I don't know any other person who has the transmission of this text right now.

57:44.838 --> 57:46.621
I have to search for that.

57:46.881 --> 57:54.131
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to bring the text to the person who can give the transmission as soon as possible.

57:54.712 --> 58:00.581
And so our effort here is to make the text available to the right person.

58:01.582 --> 58:03.224
How are you finding these people?

58:05.828 --> 58:06.409
Even the teachers?

58:06.929 --> 58:07.771
Exactly.

58:07.791 --> 58:08.472
It's the right people.

58:08.492 --> 58:12.539
The people you say, whoever you suggest is the right person.

58:12.560 --> 58:14.323
Signing lot of research people, isn't it?

58:14.383 --> 58:17.689
That kind of people, some violence and everything.

58:17.849 --> 58:19.392
Sometimes it is .

58:19.713 --> 58:28.870
Now, one example I tell you is when the Tibetans come out from Tibet, and Tibetan refugees, they're all concerned about, of course, their welfare.

58:29.170 --> 58:39.243
One thing that Gene Smith is sitting next to you, without him, all this Tibetan cake wouldn't exist in the world at all.

58:40.084 --> 58:45.612
All this publication is that without the Gene Smith, they will not be exist.

58:45.632 --> 58:57.287
So when he was, I met him as a graduate student, I met him, he did nothing, and he went to India, now, whole Tibetan literature,

58:58.178 --> 59:01.643
It's preserved through him, without his effort.

59:02.764 --> 59:03.606
They wouldn't exist.

59:03.626 --> 59:08.793
What he did is he had no money, but he sent all the universities to buy books and other things.

59:08.813 --> 59:12.959
Then he met all the Tibetan lamas, refugees, asked to bring all the secret texts.

59:13.039 --> 59:14.741
He published a print.

59:14.781 --> 59:18.066
Without him, not one of his books would go on the shelf.

59:18.526 --> 59:24.034
He started from, I think I mentioned 1970, something like that.

59:24.166 --> 59:32.655
He did really tremendous contribution to the preservation of the Tibetan heritage, or culture, whatever you call it.

59:33.336 --> 59:34.558
No other people would do that.

59:34.678 --> 59:38.822
Other people would do it like people who were in the universities, doing one or two book translations.

59:39.323 --> 59:45.950
You could ask any sort of professor that he thought, what good for the Tibetan Buddhism they have.

59:46.431 --> 59:48.753
He thought, how are we going to preserve this one?

59:49.734 --> 59:52.958
Absolutely.

59:53.647 --> 01:00:00.434
Yeah, but this was all due to my own first teacher who said, we were in the University of Washington.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:09.184
Rockefeller Foundation at that time gave money to set up nine centers of excellence in Tibetan studies throughout the world.

01:00:09.224 --> 01:00:11.166
This was when the Tibetan refugees first came.

01:00:12.267 --> 01:00:22.759
And there was a very wise man at the Rockefeller Foundation, Chadwin Gilpatrick, the brother of Roswell, who was our Secretary of Air Force during those years.

01:00:23.414 --> 01:00:31.253
Chad set up in 1959.

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:36.124
He went out and he said each center, one in the United States, is Seattle.
