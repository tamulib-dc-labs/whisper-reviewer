WEBVTT

00:03.608 --> 00:06.132
It's acting to distract upon the cliff.

00:06.192 --> 00:15.946
Before we get on to the thrust of, but it was very interesting, when you were an undergraduate at Holy Cross College, you wanted to read some books, and you had to request permission from the bishop.

00:16.226 --> 00:19.471
Well, I was introduced to Voltaire Bayeget within my freshman year.

00:19.491 --> 00:19.931
That's right.

00:19.952 --> 00:20.833
I just wanted to point it to you.

00:20.873 --> 00:21.454
That's fine.

00:21.874 --> 00:24.959
It'll pick it up.

00:24.979 --> 00:29.746
And who brought Candide in one day and read us a wonderful section from Candide.

00:30.226 --> 00:33.531
And that was the whole beginning, really, of my career in French studies.

00:34.017 --> 00:52.535
And I often wondered how my life would have turned out had I had a different instructor for French that semester, had I failed to go to class that particular day, and had I not been exposed to Voltaire one morning in, let's say, November of 1959.

00:52.796 --> 01:02.005
But the text itself, I thought, or the scene, was immensely seductive, and I wanted to read more.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.366
My appetite was whetted.

01:03.903 --> 01:19.902
But in those days, for people like me who were accepting of current religious practices and dogma... Well, I was going to.

01:19.983 --> 01:21.084
I was waiting for the word.

01:21.104 --> 01:26.871
For those who were devout, like me, there was a mortal sin to read a book that was on the Roman Index of Forbidden Books.

01:27.211 --> 01:29.594
And all of Voltaire's works were on the index.

01:29.614 --> 01:31.416
Did you mindfully avoid reading those books?

01:31.517 --> 01:32.678
I mean, did you stay away from them?

01:33.299 --> 01:35.612
Well, I wouldn't... Yes, I guess so.

01:35.914 --> 01:39.917
Had you read one surreptitiously, would you have felt like you had sinned?

01:40.437 --> 01:44.923
Well... This is fascinating.

01:45.023 --> 01:45.825
I might well have.

01:45.845 --> 01:46.866
Yes, I would have.

01:46.946 --> 01:48.188
I would have confessed it.

01:48.248 --> 01:48.829
Absolutely.

01:48.849 --> 01:49.069
Sure.

01:49.450 --> 01:51.072
I was confessing everything else I'd done.

01:51.092 --> 01:52.073
Why not confess that?

01:56.079 --> 02:01.446
So I heard about these other juicy books in addition to Candide.

02:01.466 --> 02:08.436
So I wrote to the Bishop of Worcester, Massachusetts and asked for permission to read The Red and the Black,

02:09.142 --> 02:38.828
uh madame bovary and candide and i got a letter back from him giving me permission to read all three with it with the titles uh did he ask you to justify the reason no he did not um and i wish i'd kept that letter i did keep it for years and years and i haven't seen it i haven't seen it probably in another in the last 15 or 20 years or so but did he admonish you and you're reading no it was a very polite letter and i'm some some functionary no doubt drafted it and he signed it um

02:39.972 --> 02:41.434
But it was the right thing for me to do.

02:41.474 --> 02:42.356
That's what you did.

02:42.837 --> 02:56.139
If you believed church teaching, that there was a way to get access to these books, other than simply pulling them off the shelf, and that was to go through the proper procedures and get permission from the bishop, because your soul could be endangered.

02:56.920 --> 03:03.030
Your soul supposedly was endangered by contact with the thoughts embedded in these texts.

03:03.511 --> 03:04.292
They were dangerous.

03:05.167 --> 03:10.416
And they had been seen as dangerous, not simply by the church, but also by the state.

03:10.496 --> 03:16.145
I mean, when Voltaire's works were condemned in his own lifetime, they were burned at the stake.

03:16.826 --> 03:20.773
And they were flogged symbolically by the public executioners.

03:20.873 --> 03:21.173
The books.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.315
The books themselves.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.903
It's so pertinent to the book I'm writing.

03:26.923 --> 03:30.128
But there's an even more interesting kind of sequel to this story because...

03:31.002 --> 03:48.083
Holy Cross invited me back to receive an honorary degree two years ago, and a newspaper, a reporter from the local newspaper called me for an interview prior to my going back, and I told him this story.

03:48.924 --> 03:58.355
And he also did an interview with the Jesuit, Alfred de Sautel, who is still there, and I think he's about 74, 75, still teaching.

03:58.435 --> 04:00.958
They do.

04:02.153 --> 04:31.452
and uh he got in touch with father des hotel and not only did i write to the bishop to ask for permission to read candy but father des hotel had written to the bishop also to ask permission to read candy to his students and so both of us teacher and student unbeknownst to each other were both in correspondence with the bishop of worcester about candide and about landmarks of western that's right literature now this was

04:31.853 --> 04:33.535
Not really that long ago.

04:34.195 --> 04:40.322
We're talking about something that happened in 1959.

04:40.342 --> 04:44.146
We're not talking about something that happened in 1759 or 1859.

04:44.266 --> 04:45.887
I will find a use for it.

04:45.907 --> 04:46.308
I truly will.

04:46.929 --> 04:54.136
While I was waiting out here, I noticed you have on the wall a blind plaque from the New York Times, April 29, 1996.

04:54.496 --> 04:58.901
Librarians ponder the future in the digital age.

04:59.201 --> 05:00.983
Actually, you can be useful.

05:01.368 --> 05:21.547
This will be in two chapters, maybe three or four in this book, because the concluding chapter, a chapter as a section, is going to be a continuum chapter, a continuum to... I'm really hoping to enter this debate, not to take sides, but to report and to get as many interesting stories as I can of where libraries are going.

05:24.109 --> 05:26.091
Maybe we can just enter the discussion.

05:26.111 --> 05:28.913
You certainly are bullish on libraries.

05:29.214 --> 05:30.835
I would have to conclude from

05:31.186 --> 05:34.952
having mounted that conference here in April.

05:34.972 --> 05:38.136
Maybe we could talk a little bit about that and just do the talk.

05:38.497 --> 05:42.042
This is one of the greatest ages to be involved in libraries.

05:42.383 --> 05:48.211
It is one of the greatest ages of library buildings, I'm sorry, of library building, library construction ever.

05:49.173 --> 06:00.990
Because if you look at the horizon now, you look at the landscape here in Europe and in other parts of the world, this is a moment of immense investments in library buildings as buildings.

06:01.544 --> 06:05.989
big investments in technology, too, but even bigger investments in library buildings.

06:06.009 --> 06:14.798
The French have just finished building the biggest library ever in the world at a cost of, I think, $1.6 billion.

06:15.479 --> 06:23.248
The British will soon finish, finally, the new British library at a cost of, what, Â£600 million sterling.

06:23.688 --> 06:28.453
The Germans are building a library in Frankfurt that nobody hears about because it's not controversial.

06:29.675 --> 06:30.876
I'm going to see it

06:32.273 --> 06:33.835
Monday and Tuesday this coming week.

06:34.296 --> 06:37.741
But this is a library with capacity for 18 million books.

06:39.043 --> 06:39.444
Okay?

06:40.105 --> 06:58.213
The brand new libraries in this country in Los Angeles, refurbished and new editions of Los Angeles, brand new library in San Francisco, Chicago, Cleveland, San Antonio, I think.

06:58.970 --> 07:01.012
Boston Public Library is being refurbished.

07:01.032 --> 07:06.357
We're doing a lot of building here, more or less from the outside, from the inside out.

07:07.318 --> 07:08.639
That's right.

07:10.201 --> 07:12.363
New library in Copenhagen.

07:12.583 --> 07:16.086
The Japanese are contemplating an immense new national library.

07:16.446 --> 07:17.728
Do you have an explanation for this?

07:18.649 --> 07:20.811
Well, there are several explanations.

07:21.331 --> 07:27.677
One is that the principal structures that have housed library collections

07:28.417 --> 07:40.793
in many of the world's great cities were late 19th, early 20th century facilities, or had dated from earlier periods and with upgradings.

07:40.854 --> 07:49.645
But, you know, the Great Reading Room of the BN in Paris, the Library of Congress is a 19th century building.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.149
This is an early 20th century building.

07:52.209 --> 07:57.816
And we and the collections have simply outgrown the capacity

07:58.353 --> 08:00.556
of these buildings to house them adequately.

08:02.037 --> 08:10.828
And at the turn of the century, as one of my colleagues in the world of European libraries says, it's like the 12th or 13th century.

08:11.028 --> 08:17.035
Again, if that was the age of great cathedral building in Europe, this is the age of great library building.

08:17.055 --> 08:27.668
But you can expand the metaphor, adjusting to the Gothic cathedral part of it, outside the territory of Europe and see it happening in many other parts of the world as well.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.147
Would you subscribe to that?

08:29.387 --> 08:30.729
Sure, absolutely.

08:30.810 --> 08:36.479
It's a thrilling age in that regard because great architects are being employed.

08:38.762 --> 08:46.875
Huge sums of public money, federal, state, and city are being devoted to library construction and renovation.

08:48.158 --> 08:55.309
In New York, very substantial private sector support is coming into research libraries and public libraries.

08:56.335 --> 09:03.461
One of the reasons that this is an exciting time to be involved in the management of libraries is the fact that it's a period of building.

09:04.422 --> 09:15.491
And if you like to build and be involved in that aspect of this kind of work, then this is one of the greatest periods ever.

09:16.452 --> 09:25.600
I would estimate that the total building program of this decade, I've never really done a calculation, but it's probably...

09:27.520 --> 09:32.767
I would say it's at least in the area of $3 billion that's being invested in library buildings in the 1990s.

09:32.827 --> 09:35.250
Does this reflect a commitment to the printed book?

09:35.430 --> 09:36.812
Well, that's another issue.

09:36.832 --> 09:37.894
I was going to get to that in a moment.

09:39.316 --> 09:57.139
Yes, the conviction is that books are here to stay and that libraries will not contemplate at all walking away from a commitment to preserving and storing hard copies.

09:57.676 --> 10:04.425
books, ephemera, magazines, manuscripts, all these things.

10:04.525 --> 10:10.993
And so we are building ever bigger storehouses for print copies.

10:11.774 --> 10:24.190
So from my vantage point, all this talk about the virtual library really is terribly naive and carries into it a whole set of false hypotheses that

10:24.541 --> 10:42.526
that I think take the power of contemporary technology and without a whole lot of insight use that to mount a theory of the library becoming transparent and disappearing as a structure and becoming inessential and so on and so forth.

10:42.546 --> 10:53.181
The hard reality is that we have the know-how to create electronic

10:53.920 --> 10:58.965
based images of just about anything.

10:59.445 --> 11:06.612
The Beowulf manuscript at the British Library, or 19th century photographs here, or what have you.

11:07.733 --> 11:16.721
But we don't have the resources to do that on a truly massive scale.

11:17.322 --> 11:21.025
When we did the summit here of World Library leaders in April,

11:21.359 --> 11:34.093
I calculated, according to the statistics that were given in one of these big international directories of libraries, what the total holdings of the libraries represented around the table were.

11:34.113 --> 11:40.700
And we had close to 50 libraries, research libraries, university libraries, national libraries, and urban public libraries.

11:41.761 --> 11:50.050
And if you just add up the numbers of the items in the collections, those 49 or 50 people

11:51.717 --> 12:02.826
have the responsibility of overseeing 500 million items in the collection, so half a billion items, a major portion of the world's cultural patrimony.

12:03.927 --> 12:08.411
Now, if you, all right, so 500 million, let's say each one was an average of 100 pages.

12:11.093 --> 12:16.238
And let's say that it costs between four and eight dollars a page to digitize that.

12:16.558 --> 12:18.940
We're talking billions of dollars.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.522
No one's ever going to give us

12:21.738 --> 12:26.162
billions, or even hundreds of millions of dollars, to digitize these collections.

12:26.182 --> 12:30.386
That's just not within the realm of possibility, as far as I can see.

12:30.766 --> 12:35.470
And the demand for much of it is very slight.

12:35.490 --> 12:36.391
It's very, very slight.

12:36.411 --> 12:37.231
I'll give you an example.

12:39.573 --> 12:42.276
Not all that long ago, I decided to branch out a bit.

12:42.316 --> 12:50.563
Staying within the realm of Voltaire, and more specifically the realm of Candida, I decided to go away from the text a bit and start looking at the images

12:51.100 --> 12:55.665
the illustrations that have been done over time to accompany the text.

12:56.927 --> 13:06.398
And I'd never really done that before, but I had mounted an exhibit here on La Fontaine and got involved in the relationship between illustration and text.

13:06.438 --> 13:10.803
And for La Fontaine it works wonderfully because some of the greatest artists in France had illustrated La Fontaine.

13:12.264 --> 13:19.032
And so I did a paper on Candida and its illustrators over 200 years.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.383
That became a slide talk and so on and so forth.

13:22.764 --> 13:24.966
I'm doing it in September if you can.

13:24.986 --> 13:26.669
I'll send your notice on it if you care to see it.

13:26.689 --> 13:28.311
It'll be at the Maison Francaise at NYU.

13:28.531 --> 13:30.033
It was done first for the Grollier Club.

13:30.934 --> 13:32.436
But the long and short of it is the following.

13:33.537 --> 13:47.314
I had to get my hands on all these various editions of Candidate illustrations from let's say 1778 until 1994.

13:48.813 --> 13:52.479
And somebody had done a bibliography of the illustrated editions of Kennedy.

13:53.500 --> 14:03.636
So I did a computer-based search to see what was out there and where to find the location of these books.

14:05.118 --> 14:09.325
And I saved myself a lot of time by doing that.

14:09.585 --> 14:13.812
I probably saved myself a couple of weeks' worth of old-fashioned kind of research.

14:14.373 --> 14:17.217
We had to go to the library and check the card catalog and so on and so forth.

14:19.306 --> 14:23.852
Can I go on a little bit about this?

14:24.072 --> 14:29.620
It's an illustrative story about conducting research in the humanities today.

14:31.422 --> 14:39.373
I can't speak as authoritatively about conducting research in economics and in the social sciences, because

14:40.467 --> 14:45.374
There is no doubt a higher level of presence of technology in some of those.

14:45.835 --> 14:51.803
But in any case, so I found that Columbia University had a series of things.

14:52.043 --> 15:01.357
So I went up to Columbia and looked in the electronic catalog there and got my call numbers and so on and so forth.

15:02.939 --> 15:08.567
Although, and this is off the record because I don't wish to be critical of my own university.

15:09.593 --> 15:14.158
The bibliographical records that they've mounted electronically there are very, very skimpy.

15:14.999 --> 15:18.343
And you couldn't tell from the record whether or not these books were illustrated or not.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.105
I think you find that everywhere, though.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.306
Even I think you find that at Harvard.

15:21.887 --> 15:22.187
Really?

15:23.228 --> 15:29.095
Well, that's rough, because if you're doing this particular kind of research, you need to know if there are illustrations.

15:29.275 --> 15:34.361
And the old-fashioned catalog entry would have had illustrations, and ideally illustrated by so-and-so.

15:35.081 --> 15:38.385
And some of the records that we had here were

15:38.939 --> 15:44.487
very, very detailed in terms of the illustrator and so on and so forth.

15:44.507 --> 15:53.038
So I felt lucky that I knew that some of the things that I was seeing there were illustrated, but I couldn't have learned it from that catalog.

15:53.439 --> 15:58.686
So already you got... I miss the card catalogs.

15:58.726 --> 15:59.207
I really do.

15:59.267 --> 16:01.911
I love them.

16:02.832 --> 16:04.754
So then I went up to the Rare Book Division.

16:05.515 --> 16:06.337
This is still at Columbia.

16:06.477 --> 16:07.078
Still at Columbia.

16:07.438 --> 16:08.119
And...

16:08.437 --> 16:11.421
saw the things that I needed to see, and they were very gracious.

16:12.283 --> 16:26.423
And then I happened to have a conversation with one of the rare book librarians, because one of the texts that they had there was by Rockwell Kent, one of the famous illustrations of Candide.

16:28.606 --> 16:29.247
And she said,

16:30.627 --> 16:56.567
oh you know we um downstairs the new catalog room i checked the card catalog on the electronic catalog and she happened to say oh by the way do you know that we've got a lot of the original artwork that rockwell kent did for his books great serendipitous moments and i said yes part of the kent archive or what have you i said well how's somebody to know i went through the catalogs downstairs both

16:57.391 --> 17:02.701
The hard copy and electronic catalog says, oh, but we don't cross-catalogue.

17:02.721 --> 17:06.729
This is in manuscripts, and we don't cross-catalogue manuscripts with this stuff downstairs.

17:07.991 --> 17:13.341
And my librarian colleagues here laughed when I said that, and they said, oh, of course, this is the oral tradition.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.202
It's in the librarian's head.

17:15.843 --> 17:19.909
To me, the old tradition was something else in Catholic school.

17:20.149 --> 17:28.542
It's the oral tradition, so that you always have to ask the librarian because you can't be sure that your research is ever finished.

17:28.562 --> 17:30.264
So I had the photographer come.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.326
He made all the pictures.

17:31.346 --> 17:40.780
Then I checked the BN catalog, printed, hard copy, to get all the citations I needed to look at illustrated editions in Paris.

17:42.565 --> 17:48.111
And I went to Paris, and thank God, because of this job, I get wonderful treatment in Paris.

17:48.531 --> 17:52.595
I faxed my counterpart there, everything I needed to see.

17:53.116 --> 17:55.018
I got there, they had prepaged everything.

17:55.038 --> 17:58.921
I went to one room, there were 25 different illustrated editions of Candide.

17:58.941 --> 18:01.084
I went to another room, there were 25 more waiting for me.

18:01.484 --> 18:07.390
I did, in half a day, what would have taken me... A week?

18:07.410 --> 18:11.374
Oh, two, three, maybe, depending on the number of...

18:11.675 --> 18:14.279
Not nearly as thorough either, probably.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.982
It would have been a backbreaker the other way.

18:17.605 --> 18:21.592
But that status, I mean, the point of the story is, there are several points of the story.

18:22.574 --> 18:35.556
One is that there is no substitute, and I can't imagine when there will ever be a substitute for having to displace yourself physically to go to the collection to see the real McCoy.

18:36.008 --> 18:39.593
We're going to have to do that for generations to come, I think.

18:39.613 --> 18:41.736
Well, for quite some time to come.

18:41.756 --> 18:42.758
I can't say for how long.

18:43.218 --> 18:43.659
And why?

18:44.300 --> 19:01.024
Because where's the demand and what justifies the economic commitment of even a great library like the Bibliotech National to put all these illustrated editions of Candide into electronic format?

19:01.044 --> 19:02.927
It would be thousands of pages

19:03.802 --> 19:07.486
on the off chance that somebody 50 years from now might be interested.

19:07.606 --> 19:08.127
That's right.

19:08.848 --> 19:13.993
Now, there are very few human beings who have ever done what I did.

19:14.634 --> 19:16.636
I mean, who have an interest in this?

19:16.696 --> 19:17.898
It makes for a wonderful talk.

19:17.978 --> 19:19.039
I mean, that's really a neat talk.

19:19.059 --> 19:22.623
Remind me when we're done it, just ask me about the prologue to my new book.

19:22.803 --> 19:23.224
Okay.

19:23.244 --> 19:23.704
All right.

19:23.744 --> 19:25.326
Because it's absolutely a story.

19:26.928 --> 19:28.750
It's precisely the kind of thing that you're talking about.

19:28.770 --> 19:29.251
All right.

19:29.271 --> 19:33.235
So, there are major sectors of scholarship.

19:34.278 --> 19:44.170
that rely on two things in order for them to be conducted and materialize or take place.

19:44.190 --> 19:52.500
One is that there be a curious person somewhere alive at some point in world history who is... I knew this was going to be a good day.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.565
...who's got a passionate interest in finding out about something.

19:57.065 --> 20:03.373
And the second thing is that the documents have to exist somewhere and have been preserved over time.

20:04.383 --> 20:07.506
in some archive, some library, some private collection.

20:08.087 --> 20:16.455
Some individual or people by lot, happenstance, desire, plan, what have you, chose to keep these things.

20:18.437 --> 20:21.520
And so the two get put together.

20:22.541 --> 20:34.373
And then inquiry takes place, knowledge is accumulated, and the research results are published or are disseminated somehow to other interested parties.

20:35.872 --> 20:51.812
That's a very, very concrete... My story is a concrete example of how this works contiguously, every day.

20:51.852 --> 21:01.845
There are hundreds or thousands of people in libraries all over the world who are conducting inquiry along because they're passionately interested about something and because the collection has been preserved.

21:04.323 --> 21:10.770
But the person who looks at this one phenomenon might come along.

21:10.790 --> 21:12.893
Who knows when he's going to come along or she's going to come along.

21:12.973 --> 21:14.014
It could be a very rare thing.

21:14.034 --> 21:15.075
It could be once in a century.

21:15.095 --> 21:16.336
It could be once every 20 years.

21:17.618 --> 21:18.739
You can't plan for that.

21:19.440 --> 21:33.756
So should you raise, is it prudent, is it meaningful to raise tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars to transform these colossal collections into digital formats

21:35.035 --> 21:40.623
and then try to preserve that electronic storehouse intact.

21:40.763 --> 21:42.686
That's a whole other issue.

21:42.706 --> 21:52.380
And then create all the finding tools so people can navigate into these massive databases so that the scholar can perform his own work.

21:53.462 --> 21:54.463
I don't think we're there yet.

21:56.166 --> 22:02.736
Were it ever to happen, to be sure, there'll be lots of people roaming all over through these storehouses, but I don't think it's going to happen.

22:02.756 --> 22:03.777
Let me just say one more thing.

22:04.263 --> 22:16.115
We're not planning the transition of this building here at 42nd Street into what I hope will be the most dazzling and the most awesome humanities center anywhere.

22:16.796 --> 22:22.541
Because especially other collections have been moved out to the new library, economics and public affairs and science throughout.

22:22.962 --> 22:28.267
So now we have the biggest publicly accessible humanities and social sciences collection under one roof, I think, in the world.

22:29.228 --> 22:32.211
And the publicly accessible is an important part, but anybody can come here to use them.

22:32.714 --> 22:47.774
So in order to do it right, I brought together a group of high-end, high-level scholars, and I asked Robert Darton, the historian at Princeton, whom I brought on to our board, Jared, Simon Shamas on that group, Linda Nochlin.

22:47.995 --> 23:02.434
And when we had our first meeting around this table, my question to them was, how much does electronically formatted information mean to you, and how much do you use it, and how much do your graduate students use it?

23:03.562 --> 23:04.964
Shama Darden, who else?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.165
Linda Nochlin.

23:06.226 --> 23:07.107
We can show you the list.

23:07.127 --> 23:08.609
It's a very, very good list.

23:09.109 --> 23:14.517
And I think to a person, they said they used it, as I did, for bibliographical searches.

23:15.458 --> 23:22.527
But I remember Shama saying that he still insisted that his students see the actual documents.

23:22.547 --> 23:30.598
You've got to get your hand on the letters, on the deeds, the wills, the testaments, and all these other kinds of things, the broadsides.

23:31.574 --> 23:36.860
the clandestine publications, the pamphlets, and so on and so forth, see them.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.802
And there's so much out there.

23:38.822 --> 23:52.256
I can't imagine... I just can't imagine these huge collections ever fitting on a disc the size of a penny.

23:52.817 --> 24:00.585
But there are people in positions not unlike yours who feel that... I mean, there's a gentleman at Stanford

24:01.679 --> 24:07.527
It was said to have said regarding the future, if you can't plug it in, I'm not interested.

24:07.987 --> 24:09.830
Have you heard that quote?

24:09.870 --> 24:13.054
He's a librarian?

24:13.514 --> 24:13.815
Yeah.

24:14.676 --> 24:16.719
I think he's backed away from him.

24:16.779 --> 24:18.100
It was published, as a matter of fact.

24:18.181 --> 24:19.783
It's a very foolish statement.

24:19.803 --> 24:19.903
Dumb.

24:20.323 --> 24:22.707
Very foolish statement.

24:22.747 --> 24:26.151
I'm going to question this man on this.

24:27.329 --> 24:28.631
Have the document in your hands.

24:28.851 --> 24:29.372
It really is.

24:29.412 --> 24:30.473
I think it's more than a thrill.

24:30.493 --> 24:37.101
This afternoon I'll be seeing Stephen Jay Gould, who actually, he says he cannot even work from facsimiles.

24:37.121 --> 24:44.190
He has to hold, there's something almost ineffable that comes from the document.

24:44.210 --> 24:48.235
I can put an authentic first edition of Can't Eat in Your Hands right there on the shelf.

24:48.255 --> 24:49.076
I bought it recently.

24:49.096 --> 24:52.060
There are 19 known copies in existence.

24:52.080 --> 24:52.820
The real first.

24:52.841 --> 24:54.062
You have one here in your office.

24:54.532 --> 24:55.754
Yes, it's right.

24:55.774 --> 24:56.615
You'll have to get it.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.096
Well, you see those little books there?

24:58.116 --> 25:04.444
You see the red, at the end of that shelf, all those little books are various editions of Candide from 1759.

25:04.484 --> 25:05.285
But you have them here.

25:05.305 --> 25:07.748
I find that they are... Well, they're mine.

25:07.768 --> 25:08.549
They're not the libraries.

25:09.510 --> 25:10.632
I mean, I'm not Carter Burden.

25:10.852 --> 25:13.756
I'm collecting in a very narrow niche.

25:14.356 --> 25:17.040
But yes, they're here.

25:17.160 --> 25:20.344
And what do you get out of having these... Inspiration.

25:21.926 --> 25:23.728
Inspiration.

25:24.451 --> 25:35.284
They're... Have you been to the Harvard Depository up in... Have you heard of it, the Harvard Depository?

25:35.304 --> 25:36.706
This is the off-site depository?

25:36.726 --> 25:38.869
Yeah, it's the Southboro Campus, they call it.

25:38.989 --> 25:39.530
No, I haven't.

25:39.590 --> 25:41.532
Where... It's Central Mass.

25:41.612 --> 25:43.374
It's basically... I've been there.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.879
To me, it's like a Valley of the Kings.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.741
It's a warehouse, isn't it?

25:49.482 --> 25:53.547
Really, it's there, these little modules that they build, and they keep

25:53.898 --> 25:54.679
going outward.

25:55.380 --> 25:58.543
Everyone can hold two and a half million items and everything is barcoded.

25:59.203 --> 26:00.204
They're not by titles.

26:01.626 --> 26:02.086
It's rare.

26:03.428 --> 26:06.671
Items are placed that goes back to what you were saying.

26:06.691 --> 26:10.095
They're things that haven't been requested in 25 or 30 years.

26:10.595 --> 26:16.762
If an item is requested, say, more than once a year, then it might go back to a campus library.

26:17.402 --> 26:19.584
But they're not about to digitize this stuff.

26:19.825 --> 26:20.125
Of course not.

26:20.459 --> 26:24.304
And it's there, and they have a very efficient system for retrieving, storing.

26:25.305 --> 26:31.012
They'll have it available to you in 24 hours or less if you're willing to pay a fee.

26:31.032 --> 26:33.655
And I think that that's kind of the happy balance.

26:34.836 --> 26:38.181
But I'm also interested in the shape of books of the future.

26:38.201 --> 26:46.531
I think a lot of research, particularly in the sciences, is not being published, per se, is it?

26:46.611 --> 26:50.095
It's available to these other scholars on

26:50.497 --> 26:51.518
That's what I'm hearing.

26:51.558 --> 26:53.822
Joshua, are you talking to Joshua Lederberg?

26:54.022 --> 26:54.543
Do you know him?

26:54.583 --> 26:56.786
No, but I should say somebody I should be diving through.

26:56.806 --> 27:08.041
Joshua Lederberg is a Nobel laureate and was for a number of years the head of the president of the Rockefeller University here in New York, where he's still a member of the faculty.

27:08.742 --> 27:16.193
He served on the principal advisory group that we had for Sybil in the Science Industry and Business Library.

27:16.213 --> 27:17.034
Oh, I should talk to him.

27:17.534 --> 27:19.457
And he will speak...

27:19.741 --> 27:26.231
at great length, with great insight and a lot of passion, about electronic publishing in the sciences.

27:26.852 --> 27:27.734
How do we spell his name?

27:28.435 --> 27:33.383
L-E-D-E-R-B-U-R-G.

27:34.565 --> 27:39.673
My secretary should have his number.

27:42.016 --> 27:57.055
Now, some say that he's a man of a certain age, he must be in his early 70s, and some say he's just too far out in his assumptions that referee journals in the sciences are going to go by the boards and that it'll all be taking place electronically.

27:59.057 --> 28:04.084
But I can't speak at all authoritatively about information transfer in the sciences.

28:04.104 --> 28:06.066
So, he is a...

28:07.514 --> 28:09.197
He's one of the important people in America.

28:09.817 --> 28:19.252
My sense, though, when we're talking about Candide, when we're talking about Shakespeare, when we're talking about the humanities literature, I can't see it being in any other form except for that book.

28:19.292 --> 28:25.421
Maybe I'm... Do you know a single person who's read a book from first page to last on a computer?

28:25.461 --> 28:26.222
No.

28:26.943 --> 28:36.998
And I read a piece recently that might have been in... It wasn't recently or some months ago, The Chronicle of Higher Education, about a person who wanted to read Jane Austen...

28:37.619 --> 28:42.613
The particular text she wanted wasn't in any Barnes and Nobles.

28:43.897 --> 28:53.063
It doesn't say she tried the library, but in any case, there is a Jane Austen website, and it was there, so she could pull down the whole thing.

28:53.819 --> 29:02.046
Well, she was drowning in paper because it was taking days for the whole thing to get printed out, and then she had these massive... It was impossible to handle physically.

29:02.427 --> 29:04.088
This was in what period?

29:04.108 --> 29:06.731
I think it might have been in the Chronicle of Higher Education.

29:06.931 --> 29:07.611
It was somewhere.

29:08.072 --> 29:09.833
And it was kind of hilarious.

29:10.194 --> 29:11.375
She made a big mistake.

29:11.455 --> 29:13.737
She thought she could just do it all from the internet.

29:13.757 --> 29:16.960
Well, she could, but physically it was a royal thing in the earth.

29:17.140 --> 29:22.825
I mean, it was so much more convenient to have a small format book, and it's all day, put it by your bed, you can take it with you on the airplane.

29:22.845 --> 29:23.826
The book is very efficient.

29:23.806 --> 29:24.827
device.

29:24.847 --> 29:25.749
It's user-friendly.

29:25.769 --> 29:26.830
You can fast-forward.

29:26.850 --> 29:27.711
It's very portable.

29:27.871 --> 29:29.994
I think it's the greatest human artifact in history.

29:30.014 --> 29:30.515
It's cheap.

29:30.675 --> 29:35.301
I mean, relatively, you're talking $4 a page to digitize and stuff like that.

29:35.321 --> 29:36.903
I mean, books are very reasonable.

29:36.943 --> 29:50.380
Well, there's another big issue on these digitally formatted information in virtual libraries, and that is that we don't know very much about the preservation.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.463
Well, there are cases around the

29:52.763 --> 29:56.008
things that were formatted 20 years ago, you can't get access to.

29:56.288 --> 30:04.981
Now we know an immense amount, I'm tempted to say we know all there is to know, but we don't, but we know a lot about preserving paper.

30:06.043 --> 30:08.847
We have vast amounts of experience preserving paper.

30:08.867 --> 30:11.832
We can do fabulous things on paper preservation.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.856
I saw this process in Leipzig last year.

30:15.562 --> 30:16.764
It's called Paper Splitting.

30:16.824 --> 30:17.625
Have you ever heard of that?

30:18.286 --> 30:18.766
It's awesome.

30:19.347 --> 30:21.430
Have you ever seen Modern Times, a Chaplin film?

30:21.770 --> 30:23.072
He goes through this huge machine.

30:23.432 --> 30:25.175
Well, it's a machine like that.

30:25.295 --> 30:26.216
It's as long as this room.

30:26.917 --> 30:29.881
Phil, you know, just these great big drums.

30:30.441 --> 30:43.138
It's West German technology that has been installed in Leipzig because the Deutsche Bibliothek, which is the depository library, before the war was in Leipzig,

30:43.895 --> 30:51.683
with partition after the war than there were to Leipzig and Frankfurt, and now they've unified administratively, and so there's a lot of sharing.

30:52.664 --> 30:54.807
Well, let me tell you what paper is.

30:54.827 --> 31:03.716
You take a sheet of 19th-century newsprint or early 20th-century newsprint that's very, very fragile and is crumbling.

31:04.817 --> 31:06.219
You put it into this machine.

31:09.182 --> 31:10.103
You're not going to believe this.

31:10.123 --> 31:10.844
I didn't believe this.

31:10.864 --> 31:11.945
Here's a piece of paper.

31:11.965 --> 31:13.767
It splits it down the middle this way.

31:14.101 --> 31:16.644
It separates page one from page two.

31:17.305 --> 31:19.388
It deacidifies each page.

31:20.109 --> 31:24.554
It puts a piece of neutral paper between it, re-blows it, and it comes up the other end.

31:26.116 --> 31:30.182
So we know a lot about preserving paper.

31:31.103 --> 31:36.750
And we can be sure that there's paper, that we can take fragile paper, acid-based paper,

31:37.085 --> 31:41.331
and treat it in such ways that it will last for hundreds and hundreds of years more.

31:41.351 --> 31:43.034
Is this a fairly unique machine?

31:43.154 --> 31:44.496
Is this just one place?

31:45.818 --> 31:49.904
I think it may... I don't know if there is another.

31:49.944 --> 31:52.387
I'll find out Tuesday if there's another.

31:52.427 --> 32:06.568
And then they also have a mass deacidification process that they've developed where they can put truckloads full of books on acid-based paper into these chambers.

32:07.645 --> 32:15.957
And you don't have to open them, you just put the books in, and then they're all washed with these solvents, and they come out after a couple of hours, all BS at a time.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.519
What do you think it costs per page?

32:18.320 --> 32:18.801
I don't know.

32:18.821 --> 32:20.904
You think it's more than the $4 per page?

32:21.144 --> 32:21.985
It is quite expensive.

32:22.085 --> 32:23.027
I'm sure it's expensive.

32:23.107 --> 32:28.735
And you would only do this, of course, with an exceedingly scarce and rare book.

32:28.755 --> 32:29.316
Well, I don't know.

32:29.336 --> 32:33.482
The stuff that I saw in the trailers, they look like Pulp Fiction from the 50s.

32:33.502 --> 32:35.044
Because they're preserving stuff?

32:35.064 --> 32:35.965
Yes, yes.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.154
Yes, they are.

32:37.214 --> 32:39.477
Without passing judgment on literary merit.

32:39.538 --> 32:40.319
Correct.

32:40.900 --> 32:52.696
Well, you know, if you believe Darnton and Darnton's whole analysis of what people were really reading in the French 18th century, it's not so much Montesquieu.

32:52.716 --> 32:54.118
It's a great book, yeah.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.962
Yeah, it's the stuff that has no literary merit.

33:00.107 --> 33:02.931
It's reminding me of things that have to be honest with you.

33:04.868 --> 33:07.133
So we know a lot about how to preserve this stuff.

33:07.895 --> 33:16.073
We don't know very much about preserving big, big data sets electronically over the space of hundreds of years.

33:16.113 --> 33:23.670
And if you're a library like ours, or like Paris, or Morgan, or the British Library, what have you,

33:24.511 --> 33:27.916
your conservation efforts are focused on hard copy.

33:28.697 --> 33:43.058
And to transfer all this into electronic format and throw away the hard copy and rely on the electronically formatted stuff without knowing how it's going to live for 100 years, 200 years, 300 years, you know, nobody's going to do that.

33:43.318 --> 33:46.122
And you wonder what kind of a grievous mistake you're going to be making.

33:46.222 --> 33:53.893
I mean, when you think of the typesetters who, that's what they call them, the compositors who put the first folio of Shakespeare from the

33:54.245 --> 33:56.488
purportedly from the true original manuscripts?

33:57.029 --> 33:57.810
I said, did I put it tight?

33:57.830 --> 33:59.733
And then what did they do, throw the manuscripts away?

33:59.753 --> 34:02.577
Yes.

34:02.597 --> 34:08.967
I mean, we're basically saying a similar kind of a thing, aren't we?

34:09.347 --> 34:10.229
You throw this away?

34:10.309 --> 34:11.731
Fine, because we're going to be all set.

34:11.771 --> 34:12.292
But guess what?

34:12.312 --> 34:13.193
You're not all set.

34:13.213 --> 34:15.156
Well, supposedly you have some great people, you know,

34:16.047 --> 34:20.553
continent-wide blackout, and your computer gets turned off.

34:20.893 --> 34:21.714
Your library's gone.

34:21.834 --> 34:28.082
Chapter four of this book was erased by my 10-year-old daughter.

34:28.203 --> 34:29.324
It was an 18,000-word.

34:29.424 --> 34:34.290
It had to be totally rewritten, you know, because Dad here didn't have the foresight.

34:34.351 --> 34:35.852
I've done it myself, never on that scale.

34:36.653 --> 34:38.776
But it made for a much better chapter, actually.

34:40.639 --> 34:41.119
Interesting.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.063
Do you have recommendations for people

34:44.482 --> 34:49.608
You mentioned the new French library, people that I could contact who would show me through these.

34:50.469 --> 34:50.970
Oh, sure.

34:51.371 --> 34:52.332
You'll be traveling, will you?

34:52.832 --> 34:54.394
Major traveling, yeah.

34:54.414 --> 34:59.941
This opening chapter is going to be kind of a historical travelogue through libraries.

35:00.061 --> 35:00.842
Oh, wonderful.

35:01.623 --> 35:02.084
Starting when?

35:02.805 --> 35:03.926
I'm going to go to Pergamum.

35:04.086 --> 35:04.507
You are.

35:04.687 --> 35:05.188
Good for you.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.532
Go to Ephesus, where I go to Patmos.

35:08.849 --> 35:14.815
Maybe you could recommend some libraries that are really significant along the way through history.

35:14.835 --> 35:15.255
St.

35:15.276 --> 35:21.382
Carl, you know, the great scriptorium, and find some chained libraries, and just keep St.

35:21.402 --> 35:22.042
Petersburg.

35:22.142 --> 35:24.245
It's going to be crazy.

35:24.325 --> 35:27.148
We may be there at Thanksgiving time, St.

35:27.188 --> 35:29.310
Petersburg.

35:30.891 --> 35:33.574
If you can think of any people I should be contacting,

35:34.060 --> 35:36.083
I haven't made any contact.

35:36.604 --> 35:41.552
Why don't you send me your list and I'll tell you who I know.

35:42.834 --> 35:45.598
The people I know are in the libraries that were represented at the summit.

35:46.239 --> 35:49.865
And I can open doors, I think, at virtually any one of those libraries.

35:50.125 --> 35:56.595
Let me give you a copy of that program, which is the library.

35:57.156 --> 36:01.603
And these are the people who came here.

36:03.068 --> 36:05.292
I found out about this after the fact.

36:05.352 --> 36:06.013
I would have been here.

36:06.193 --> 36:17.613
And then this is a copy of our annual report from last year, which has some wonderful, wonderful things said about the library by people like David Remnick and Toni Morrison and so on and so forth.

36:18.415 --> 36:19.436
That's beautiful.

36:19.456 --> 36:23.784
Yeah, it's just a super issue.

36:23.804 --> 36:27.270
Did you ever see David Remnick's essay on the library, The New Yorker, last May?

36:27.875 --> 36:32.543
Is that in his new collection that's just coming out?

36:32.603 --> 36:33.505
No, it's not.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.972
I'll help my assistant make a copy of it for you.

36:37.992 --> 36:38.052
Oh.

36:38.072 --> 36:49.352
This is a very good trip.

36:49.372 --> 36:53.038
Yeah, I think it's Random House is publishing his...

36:53.862 --> 37:00.388
Yes, I just got an advanced copy, but they're all about people.

37:01.049 --> 37:04.572
They're sort of profiles that were from The New Yorker.

37:05.273 --> 37:16.984
And I had four hours of interviews with him, and it didn't turn out to be a profile on me, which is just as well because... Has there been a profile of you I should know about?

37:17.004 --> 37:17.204
No.

37:17.825 --> 37:18.245
No.

37:18.585 --> 37:23.650
He mentions me in this thing in a very flattering way, but...

37:25.132 --> 37:31.764
I tend to not go for the spotlight.

37:31.804 --> 37:33.087
There are some people who do.

37:33.107 --> 37:34.089
I tend not to.

37:34.109 --> 37:40.220
I don't think it's necessarily the library's best interest to be a big personality.

37:43.526 --> 37:48.996
We went up in a couple of directions, but I thought we'd just... Great, I'm just trying to get back on where I...

37:49.465 --> 37:54.917
I think you really covered your feelings on the digital age.

37:54.957 --> 37:56.941
What was the consensus of your colleagues here?

37:57.663 --> 38:00.629
I read the New York Times reports.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.132
There are a couple more.

38:02.212 --> 38:07.103
It's really an issue that we could talk about for a whole day.

38:09.496 --> 38:18.805
Now, the position that I staked out has to be a little bit more nuanced than I stated it, because it's a partial position.

38:19.065 --> 38:25.131
It's not to deny the profound significance and implication of electronically formatted information.

38:25.872 --> 38:34.761
When I came to the library, I made a decision that we had to put the printed catalog online, because it's 800 volumes long, folio-sized,

38:35.264 --> 38:42.914
The A's alone take up 52 or 53 volumes, and until we put that online, the world won't know what we've got within the collections.

38:43.695 --> 38:56.852
And we are now talking with a private sector partner about digitizing significant portions of the collection for which there is demand and the market.

38:57.653 --> 39:04.242
We don't know very much about market, and we don't have the resources to do the digitization ourselves, but if this project...

39:04.947 --> 39:14.878
materializes, then some very important elements of the New York Public Library's collections will be available electronically.

39:15.538 --> 39:34.178
So I'm putting a lot of emphasis on moving into the electronic age but doing so in a way that is prudent fiscally, that has a return to us, that has a conservation element attached to it, but will not

39:36.132 --> 39:39.859
change our policy or attitude towards keeping hard copy.

39:39.879 --> 39:41.121
That's an excellent quote.

39:41.141 --> 39:45.670
I mean, I can see it in type, too, as you say.

39:46.872 --> 39:51.761
Actually, there were, thank you very much, there were a couple of profiles.

39:51.781 --> 39:53.124
There were two in the New York Times.

39:53.545 --> 39:55.749
Okay, I'll find them.

39:56.029 --> 39:58.073
We'll get them for you.

40:04.178 --> 40:07.288
I was interrupted to say you could see that it was a great quote, you could see it all in type.

40:07.589 --> 40:13.750
It reminded me that Grimes sort of characterized me as...

40:14.810 --> 40:18.754
coming out of the French rationalist tradition, and you could tell when I spoke.

40:19.034 --> 40:20.675
I don't know how true that is.

40:21.156 --> 40:23.198
I wish I could have coined that phrase.

40:23.238 --> 40:27.942
That was a sudden association with the profile.

40:28.142 --> 40:32.726
When you've done enough of these interviews, you can really judge these quotes as you're hearing them.

40:33.207 --> 40:38.632
Well, the people in my press, our press office, always criticize me for not giving sound bites.

40:38.652 --> 40:39.693
I can't give sound bites.

40:40.233 --> 40:41.575
I'm an academic.

40:42.335 --> 40:44.277
I love these long, discursive,

40:44.476 --> 40:44.937
interviews.

40:44.977 --> 40:49.404
When you opened it with that long, you gave me some good stuff I didn't even intend to cover.

40:49.464 --> 40:52.509
I'm also, by the way, going to go to Sarajevo.

40:52.609 --> 40:53.310
I'm really interested.

40:53.510 --> 40:54.712
Oh, what a sad story, though.

40:54.772 --> 40:58.138
And I'm going to cover that in absolute depth.

40:58.158 --> 40:58.739
Breaks my heart.

40:58.759 --> 41:03.987
I was just with Andras Riedelmeyer at Harvard two days ago, who's kind of doing the American, trying to do

41:04.777 --> 41:06.420
head up the Sarajevo project.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.562
Oh, I'd love to meet him.

41:07.582 --> 41:08.744
Put him in contact with me.

41:08.764 --> 41:11.368
I will happily do that in his email, too.

41:11.448 --> 41:12.330
I don't.

41:12.510 --> 41:14.714
Okay, well, fine.

41:14.774 --> 41:22.868
He's a nice, nice man, and I don't have his phone number with me, but I can take care of this when I get home.

41:22.988 --> 41:23.950
Okay.

41:24.807 --> 41:28.472
I just mentioned that if you are into email or anything, he loves to send emails.

41:28.492 --> 41:29.193
Well, I'm on it.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.336
But no one, he would call you in five seconds.

41:31.356 --> 41:34.239
This is the first computer in the president's office in the history of the library.

41:35.261 --> 41:38.325
I know this time, too.

41:38.345 --> 41:49.279
But I'm deluged by, they bring mail in by the wheelbarrow full here just about every day, and then what they do is they wind up printing out the email messages, so they don't have more paper in it.

41:49.529 --> 41:50.390
It's just too much.

41:50.531 --> 41:52.073
I've gotten into it just this morning.

41:52.153 --> 41:53.956
I bought a scanner for my computer.

41:57.081 --> 41:59.505
I'm not totally anti-digital stuff.

41:59.525 --> 42:05.194
I've got a beautiful little Toshiba machine that's going to go with me to places, and it's a tool.

42:06.375 --> 42:12.465
But I'm also going to have a chapter on the emigre booksellers, the Jewish...

42:13.154 --> 42:15.798
booksellers who were forced out of Germany by Hitler.

42:15.818 --> 42:18.622
Are you familiar with Marty Rosenthal's lecture at Columbia in 87?

42:18.902 --> 42:21.225
It was called The Gentle Invaders.

42:22.187 --> 42:24.590
And he identified 50 booksellers.

42:25.231 --> 42:31.380
According to Roger Stoddard, who points, waves his arms at Harvard and says, we owe so much to Hitler here.

42:31.820 --> 42:33.422
And he says this without irony.

42:33.462 --> 42:38.029
You should see Bernard Breslauer.

42:38.169 --> 42:39.351
He's on the list.

42:39.371 --> 42:40.292
Well, he's very old.

42:40.812 --> 42:42.073
He's very old.

42:42.234 --> 42:44.136
Well, I did Otto Bettman, who's 96.

42:46.859 --> 42:48.120
I did Otto with his book.

42:48.721 --> 42:50.242
My father was wonderful.

42:50.322 --> 42:51.664
Well, Breslauer's wonderful, too.

42:52.024 --> 42:57.010
Breslauer feasts, because he took all this over from his father.

42:57.030 --> 42:58.071
He's not that old, is he?

42:58.391 --> 42:59.092
He's in his 80s.

42:59.372 --> 42:59.973
Is he really?

43:00.053 --> 43:00.333
Yeah.

43:03.236 --> 43:04.198
I didn't know he was in his 80s.

43:04.298 --> 43:05.078
I better see him soon.

43:05.099 --> 43:07.201
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

43:07.221 --> 43:08.322
You should.

43:08.470 --> 43:11.273
I put the octogenarians at the top of the list.

43:11.413 --> 43:13.316
All it has to do is trip and it's over.

43:13.436 --> 43:16.640
Well, Otto, I couldn't get to Florida fast enough.

43:16.660 --> 43:18.021
You know why I went to see Otto?

43:18.101 --> 43:19.243
I mean, the Bettman Archive.

43:19.923 --> 43:20.404
Bill Gates.

43:20.424 --> 43:22.606
I'm going out to Corbis next month.

43:22.626 --> 43:23.768
I'm going to spend a couple days.

43:23.808 --> 43:32.818
You know, Corbis, who's digitizing the Bettman Archive, the Hermitage, the Ansel Adams stuff, the Barnes Foundation.

43:33.439 --> 43:34.861
You know, I'm going to comment on this.

43:34.881 --> 43:35.421
Yeah, would you?

43:35.762 --> 43:35.962
No.

43:36.563 --> 43:37.684
Well, not on Gates.

43:37.968 --> 43:40.652
Well, why not?

43:40.672 --> 43:44.937
There's an op-ed piece that I wrote that the Times will run on Saturday.

43:45.338 --> 43:46.179
Oh, okay.

43:47.661 --> 43:51.145
On connecting the public to the Internet through libraries.

43:51.165 --> 43:54.430
Don't comment on Gates by name, but maybe you have a comment on this trend.

43:55.691 --> 44:03.081
No, what I want is for one of these mega-billionaires to do for the nation what Andrew Carnegie did for it at the Ternison.

44:03.432 --> 44:07.039
And I just got the book about his library in Chicago.

44:07.459 --> 44:08.301
I came in yesterday.

44:08.321 --> 44:08.702
I never chanced.

44:08.722 --> 44:11.928
Do you know what the dollar value of his investment was in today's dollars?

44:12.188 --> 44:12.909
No.

44:12.929 --> 44:21.525
Well, over the space of, let's say, 20 years, he built almost 1,700 libraries in over 1,400 communities in America.

44:22.383 --> 44:24.145
He spent $41 million then.

44:24.305 --> 44:26.187
That's the equivalent of a billion dollars today.

44:26.568 --> 44:29.131
I interrupted you while you were making a very good quote.

44:29.151 --> 44:31.273
You'd like to have one of these mega-billionaires do what?

44:31.313 --> 44:32.955
You want to do that as a full, complete quote?

44:32.975 --> 44:33.716
Sure, sure.

44:33.796 --> 44:36.059
What to do for America?

44:36.439 --> 44:45.890
I would like to see one of these mega-billionaires do for the nation what Andrew Carnegie did for it at the turn of the century.

44:45.910 --> 44:51.917
That is to use their wealth

44:53.737 --> 44:59.447
to bring the people into contact with massive amounts of information.

45:02.372 --> 45:06.820
Now, it's said better in this... Because I've had peace Saturday.

45:09.686 --> 45:11.669
I can get you... I'll get the time.

45:11.889 --> 45:13.332
No, we've got the time.

45:15.151 --> 45:24.307
It's one of the few buildings in which the architects design everything, everything, the inside, the outside, every single piece of furniture, the door handles, the whole thing.

45:25.589 --> 45:27.633
That's Voltaire from the library's collection.

45:28.735 --> 45:40.095
This is a wonderful portrait of Franklin that was done during his stint in Paris as the American Minister of Plendipotentiary that came to us from one of the founders of the library.

45:40.615 --> 45:41.556
John Bigelow.

45:41.736 --> 46:07.062
Bigelow was Lincoln's ambassador to France and was a bibliophile, and I took my first job at Union College at Schenectady, because when I went for my interviewâI was at a graduate student at Columbia doing a dissertationâI learned about the Bigelow collection in the Union College library, and a vast

46:08.948 --> 46:22.289
proportion of Bigelow's library went to Union, and it was basically 18th and 19th century stuff, and I wrote my whole dissertation out of that library, using the Bigelow collection.

46:22.429 --> 46:27.497
And it's very odd, because I was then 24, 25, and

46:28.743 --> 46:47.941
The circle is completed now because I began my career based on Bigelow's books at Union, and I wind up in the library that Bigelow helped found with a portrait of Franklin, of course, who was a pioneer in American libraries by starting the Library Company of Philadelphia.

46:47.981 --> 46:49.142
Did he sit for that portrait?

46:49.162 --> 46:50.263
Yes.

46:50.283 --> 46:50.764
I believe so.

46:51.044 --> 46:51.284
Wow.

46:52.045 --> 46:55.088
That's exciting, isn't it?

46:55.304 --> 46:57.607
I get a kick out of things like this.

46:57.627 --> 47:15.849
Well, there's an interesting connection between American ambassadors to France and libraries also, because... Franklin was a pioneer in America by starting the Library Company in Philadelphia, became... Which I write about.

47:15.869 --> 47:21.295
...became the Minister Plano Potentiary.

47:22.135 --> 47:32.209
Jefferson was the American ambassador to France also, and then his library became the nucleus for the Library of Congress.

47:32.229 --> 47:35.173
And also the University of Virginia, too, later.

47:35.193 --> 47:44.886
And then Mr. Bigelow was Lincoln's ambassador to France, an important to believe file, and then founded the New York Public Library.

47:45.046 --> 47:50.274
I don't know how many other ambassadors to France have a relationship to libraries like that.

47:50.314 --> 47:51.315
That's a great story.

47:51.565 --> 47:57.594
It is, and I used it in November when I gave a speech in France.

47:58.876 --> 48:09.311
It was the 75th anniversary of the founding of the American Library in Paris, and Ambassador Harriman was one of the dinner co-chairs, so I threaded this throughout that.

48:09.331 --> 48:13.197
If you can't ever see a copy of that little speech, I can give that to you also.

48:13.898 --> 48:15.160
I would, but I don't want to...

48:15.545 --> 48:16.246
Not right now.

48:16.266 --> 48:17.508
Maybe we can mail it to me.

48:17.528 --> 48:19.029
I know we're running out of time.

48:19.150 --> 48:20.932
Are you going to come back to see me?

48:21.272 --> 48:22.414
I'd like to.

48:22.474 --> 48:23.055
Sure.

48:23.715 --> 48:24.356
It'll be a while.

48:25.458 --> 48:26.279
Okay.

48:26.299 --> 48:26.619
I'll wait.

48:26.639 --> 48:29.503
But I can talk to Miss Cunningham, too.

48:29.523 --> 48:31.726
Maybe she can send me some of this stuff, too.

48:32.006 --> 48:34.990
But I don't want to see you.

48:35.290 --> 48:36.672
It's embarrassing me.

48:37.493 --> 48:40.557
How about the speech?

48:40.823 --> 48:43.769
in Paris, for the American library in Paris.

48:44.350 --> 48:45.352
You're wonderful.

48:45.372 --> 48:47.977
Appreciate it.

48:52.186 --> 48:53.629
Good stuff.

48:53.649 --> 48:55.092
I'm going to turn this to the other side.

48:55.432 --> 49:00.182
I'm going to turn this to the other side now.
