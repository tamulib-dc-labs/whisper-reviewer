WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:05.147
We're talking to Mr. Max Israel.

00:05.908 --> 00:09.993
If you could just start and tell me about your family.

00:10.033 --> 00:12.455
You come from a family of booksellers.

00:12.475 --> 00:13.016
Booksellers, yeah.

00:13.817 --> 00:19.584
Well, my father was a bookseller, and he had three brothers, and they're all three booksellers.

00:22.046 --> 00:28.654
The oldest one was murdered by the Germans on his trip to

00:30.102 --> 00:32.004
to Switzerland.

00:32.444 --> 00:37.129
First, my youngest brother went to Switzerland and succeeded.

00:37.169 --> 00:56.329
And my old brother missed the parents-in-law of my youngest brother to follow, but they were they were

00:59.465 --> 01:01.869
Capture by the Germans and brothers.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.332
This is your uncle?

01:05.594 --> 01:07.397
Who was captured by the Germans?

01:08.999 --> 01:14.908
My older brother and the parents-in-law of my younger brother.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.333
And what were their names?

01:18.474 --> 01:21.879
Could you tell me their names of your brothers?

01:22.139 --> 01:22.620
Solomon.

01:23.581 --> 01:24.222
How do you spell?

01:24.923 --> 01:28.088
S-A-L-O-M-O.

01:31.055 --> 01:32.176
And he was captioned.

01:33.258 --> 01:40.487
Yes, he was, he was forgotten.

01:40.528 --> 01:42.070
I had to ask, I had to ask.

01:42.290 --> 01:46.495
That's okay, no, no, we'll come back to it, yeah.

01:46.616 --> 01:47.457
Yeah, I like that.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.279
He knows English better.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.625
He's in the graduate of English, so.

01:53.785 --> 01:57.230
And you learned, was your grandfather a bookseller too?

01:57.430 --> 01:59.813
My grandfather, yeah, my father was a bookseller.

02:00.113 --> 02:03.176
And so how did he start in the, how did he start in the business?

02:03.336 --> 02:04.917
How did he start in the business?

02:05.097 --> 02:15.827
Well, by luck, but he studied for Robin, came in touch with the socialism, and saw socialism is better as religion.

02:17.188 --> 02:26.917
And so I stopped with his study at the seminarium, and became a bookseller in Arnhem.

02:29.059 --> 02:30.120
And he had three friends.

02:30.505 --> 02:33.849
First, yes, and all four became booksellers.

02:34.350 --> 02:41.620
What was it about the business that attracted you to become a bookseller?

02:41.640 --> 02:44.964
Well, as a child, I was already interested in books.

02:47.107 --> 03:00.124
I was at the primary school, and I said, I remember that I said to my teacher to ask me, what do you like to be in...

03:01.538 --> 03:02.279
and future.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.521
That's a bookseller.

03:06.362 --> 03:10.686
And what kinds of things did your father teach you about books?

03:11.927 --> 03:15.851
Well, you start what your father says.

03:16.812 --> 03:22.257
But does he teach you things like bibliography, how to... Well, that I've done myself.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.319
My most name is from my older brother.

03:26.340 --> 03:31.545
And, you know, in fact, as I did bibliography.

03:31.846 --> 03:33.228
Mm-hmm.

03:33.248 --> 03:35.370
This was up in Arnhem first, right?

03:35.390 --> 03:36.191
In Arnhem, yes.

03:36.211 --> 03:41.297
But after the war in 1945, I went to Amsterdam.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.002
In 1945, you came to Amsterdam?

03:46.023 --> 03:52.911
Yes, and... ...with my younger brother.

03:54.152 --> 03:54.312
Mm-hmm.

03:54.332 --> 03:58.057
Um... Were you in business before the war?

03:59.238 --> 03:59.338
Yeah.

03:59.723 --> 04:02.586
I was the only profession I had a bookseller.

04:03.467 --> 04:03.607
Uh-huh.

04:03.627 --> 04:06.030
But I mean, before the war, you were in the book business.

04:06.470 --> 04:07.591
Yes, at Arnhem.

04:07.751 --> 04:08.252
At Arnhem.

04:08.272 --> 04:11.996
And you had to... No, I was 50 when I entered the bookshop.

04:13.798 --> 04:13.938
Mm-hmm.

04:13.958 --> 04:16.320
So, during the war you hid, right?

04:16.521 --> 04:18.483
I was hid in Yeshua.

04:18.563 --> 04:18.803
Where?

04:18.903 --> 04:20.465
Could you tell me a little bit about that?

04:21.005 --> 04:24.869
Well, I was hid in... Well, I was different addresses.

04:26.271 --> 04:28.313
Plus, I was...

04:28.765 --> 04:43.547
with the parents of a companion of me in prison, and I went to them to say hello and to tell them how her son was.

04:43.567 --> 04:56.106
We were together next in the cell of the prison, and we promised each other.

04:56.423 --> 05:06.034
He was, when he was free, he should go to my mother, and when I was free, I should go to his parents, you know.

05:06.054 --> 05:10.179
And then I said, can I come here when I had to be hidden?

05:10.980 --> 05:19.630
Then they said yes, but it lasted only a few weeks, and I was near the

05:26.444 --> 05:29.527
Well, it's better perhaps I was... Okay.

05:31.570 --> 05:31.690
Yeah.

05:31.710 --> 05:56.417
I was, I, I, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,

05:57.157 --> 06:00.520
Do you mind helping us with the translation?

06:00.540 --> 06:00.781
Yes, sure.

06:01.121 --> 06:09.530
Because we were talking about, I asked him, we were talking about the war and how he managed, and I really couldn't pick up much of what he was saying about how he managed to hide during the war.

06:09.550 --> 06:10.731
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:10.751 --> 06:12.353
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.854
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.816
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:16.116 --> 06:17.097
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:17.118 --> 06:18.078
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:18.099 --> 06:19.100
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.081
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:20.101 --> 06:21.302
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:21.322 --> 06:22.343
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:22.363 --> 06:24.265
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:24.285 --> 06:25.386
How, how, how he managed to hide during the war.

06:25.406 --> 06:26.387
How, how, how he managed to hide during the

06:27.616 --> 06:35.708
I came in a family in the center of a wood, who was a boatmaker.

06:35.728 --> 06:44.221
A forest, Mr. Israel managed to reach people who lived in the middle of a forest, very secluded, and there he stayed.

06:44.261 --> 06:45.363
Was that near Arnhem?

06:46.084 --> 06:49.109
Yes, in the vicinity of Arnhem.

06:49.730 --> 06:50.731
Was he by himself?

06:51.052 --> 06:51.733
Alain, he was alone.

06:51.753 --> 06:53.195
I was alone, yes.

06:53.295 --> 06:55.018
By himself.

06:55.078 --> 06:56.560
It was about first he met from Arnhem.

06:58.227 --> 07:00.871
And how long, how long did you manage to stay out there?

07:01.311 --> 07:14.830
Well, I managed 15 minutes and then I had to change because one of my assistant, my former assistant was called by the Germans.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.434
I was afraid that we could

07:18.292 --> 07:24.659
to disclose his position at that moment.

07:24.679 --> 07:35.070
So after about 15 months he had to... So what year roughly are we talking about?

07:36.572 --> 07:47.083
Well, I stayed there and then I came...

07:47.367 --> 08:16.328
with other people and I came in the neighborhood of that place where I was hidden and came in with

08:18.164 --> 08:20.147
What's the concern?

08:20.167 --> 08:20.768
The housekeeper?

08:21.148 --> 08:25.194
The housekeeper in hospital.

08:27.237 --> 08:32.424
And there I stayed for the liberation, nearly.

08:32.444 --> 08:33.326
So about three years.

08:34.227 --> 08:34.307
Hmm?

08:34.327 --> 08:35.549
About three years, maybe?

08:35.569 --> 08:36.671
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

08:36.831 --> 08:37.892
Eighteen months or so.

08:37.912 --> 08:42.138
Now, when did he... This he was hiding because he was Jewish, of course, right?

08:42.279 --> 08:42.499
Yes.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.403
And you knew, of course, that

08:46.784 --> 08:50.468
I mean there was no secret that if you were Jewish you were in grave danger.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.350
I mean you knew this of course.

08:52.811 --> 08:53.592
Of course.

08:55.834 --> 08:59.519
Before I was in the underground and that was the reason I was in the hospital.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.500
And present.

09:01.040 --> 09:01.901
He was in the underground?

09:02.582 --> 09:03.904
Is that what he said?

09:03.924 --> 09:06.046
For secrets, yeah.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.450
He was in hiding already and then he was

09:09.633 --> 09:15.260
I was in Schevelingen prison for six months.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.441
How do you spell that?

09:16.982 --> 09:21.247
S-C-H-E-V-E-N-I-T-E.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.351
S-C-H-E-V-E-N-I-T-E.

09:24.371 --> 09:33.022
And then after six months I was transferred to the concentration camp in Amerford.

09:33.803 --> 09:36.366
And I stayed there for three months and then I was released.

09:36.734 --> 09:38.496
Now, he was kept prisoner by the Germans?

09:38.516 --> 09:39.778
By the Germans.

09:39.858 --> 09:41.040
And you were released.

09:41.901 --> 09:47.008
Yeah, but... Yeah, it was luck.

09:47.289 --> 09:48.370
By chance.

09:49.011 --> 09:50.433
By chance.

09:50.473 --> 10:06.235
What was the... What was the... What was the... What was the... What was the... I was convicted for three months in concentration camp.

10:06.586 --> 10:32.256
and that was in Amersfoort Amersfoort A-M-E-R-S A-M-E-R-S F-O-O-R-T and that's here in Holland but that was a German prison a German concentration camp German concentration camp but sometimes run

10:33.805 --> 10:40.074
Well, the keepers there were, of course, not only Germans, but also... Yeah, they were all the Germans.

10:40.094 --> 10:40.675
Alleen dan?

10:40.695 --> 10:41.215
Alleen dan?

10:41.235 --> 10:44.700
There's geen Nederlanders erbij.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.703
Did you have fears that you would not live?

10:46.823 --> 10:50.608
I mean, did you think that while you were held prisoner?

10:50.648 --> 10:56.416
Well, fear you had... you had a lot of fear.

10:56.436 --> 11:01.604
Of course I had fear that I would be caught, but I was very... was it?

11:01.684 --> 11:02.665
Careful?

11:03.488 --> 11:11.137
And let's jump ahead to liberation and after the war and you come back to the book business.

11:11.357 --> 11:12.198
What did you find?

11:13.540 --> 11:21.349
Well, what I found was that we had nothing anymore, you know.

11:21.369 --> 11:32.922
That all the books by my father and brothers had together had in stock, lost, and was sold by the Germans.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.591
Hmm.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.954
So we had to start again, again.

11:38.755 --> 11:39.035
You.

11:41.498 --> 11:45.122
And, yeah, my brother died here in Amsterdam.

11:45.142 --> 11:45.742
He started.

11:46.804 --> 11:48.846
So you decided to move here to Amsterdam?

11:48.886 --> 11:52.810
Yes, well.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.692
So how did you start looking for books?

11:54.832 --> 11:55.813
Where, where did you look?

11:58.416 --> 12:00.939
Were there a lot of books available?

12:01.319 --> 12:03.702
No, I, I had nearly no books.

12:04.002 --> 12:11.631
If you know that we had a fine shop and a bit, a great warehouse.

12:13.754 --> 12:16.457
And business in Nijmegen.

12:19.361 --> 12:23.325
And then in Amsterdam.

12:27.310 --> 12:30.014
Then there was nearly nothing over.

12:30.995 --> 12:32.737
Nothing left.

12:32.757 --> 12:33.638
Nothing left.

12:33.972 --> 12:36.157
Tens of thousands of books.

12:36.177 --> 12:38.403
What did he say?

12:38.443 --> 12:39.666
Tens of thousands of books.

12:39.706 --> 12:41.530
They lost ten thousands of books?

12:41.630 --> 12:42.633
Tens of thousands.

12:43.034 --> 12:44.377
Really storage high.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.780
The building in Arnhem was huge.

12:45.941 --> 12:46.903
And they had warehouses.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.028
They had business in Nijmegen.

12:50.122 --> 12:52.804
Were the books stolen or were they destroyed?

12:52.984 --> 12:54.846
They were taken away.

12:54.866 --> 12:56.928
They were sold, sold at auction.

12:56.948 --> 12:57.969
By the Germans?

12:58.089 --> 13:01.392
By the Germans, by the people who... Who is that?

13:01.412 --> 13:05.075
The Verwalters, the people who were left in charge of the business.

13:05.395 --> 13:13.622
The Germans appointed what they called Verwalters, people who took charge.

13:13.903 --> 13:16.185
Charger, well, every U.S.

13:16.665 --> 13:20.128
Antigran bookseller was produced at Verwalters.

13:20.463 --> 13:23.926
All the Jewish booksellers had to work under a Verwalter.

13:23.946 --> 13:25.588
How do you call it Verwalter?

13:26.269 --> 13:36.899
V-E-R-W-A-L-T-E-R, Verwalter, which is something, it's a German word for... Custodian or... Yes, or... Custodian?

13:36.919 --> 13:39.582
People... Well, they... They were the head of business.

13:39.722 --> 13:41.363
Yeah, really the head of business.

13:41.383 --> 13:43.486
They were allowed to do anything.

13:43.846 --> 13:44.386
Anything goes.

13:45.067 --> 13:50.132
And the Jewish booksellers were out of the business.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.602
But how about the brains?

13:53.604 --> 13:58.051
You know, of course, the whole point of the Jewish booksellers was their knowledge, too.

13:59.533 --> 14:02.858
And so what they did is they just took the books and sold them to anyone?

14:03.699 --> 14:03.999
No.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.184
They sold their own sales.

14:07.204 --> 14:07.725
Sales, auctions.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.567
And they presented them to Hitler.

14:11.470 --> 14:11.771
Yeah.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.157
Because lava is built up in Linz.

14:17.218 --> 14:18.580
Where in?

14:19.161 --> 14:20.423
In Austria.

14:20.892 --> 14:24.057
to some of your books the Germans took for their own libraries.

14:24.538 --> 14:29.445
They were all lost.

14:29.485 --> 14:36.376
They couldn't even bring charges to whoever to get back the books.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.740
There were absolutely futile attempts.

14:39.842 --> 14:40.823
Didn't work.

14:41.364 --> 14:42.926
So how did they go about rebuilding?

14:44.869 --> 14:48.435
Well,

14:49.647 --> 14:50.248
No stock.

14:50.288 --> 14:56.577
We had a small shop in the Leidse straat here.

14:57.218 --> 14:59.140
My brothers are there.

14:59.160 --> 14:59.661
And then we stopped.

14:59.681 --> 15:02.906
A small shop in the Leidse straat, which is not very far from here.

15:03.787 --> 15:05.890
And what are we going to do now?

15:06.170 --> 15:07.332
Letterkunde?

15:07.412 --> 15:08.173
Modern books.

15:08.193 --> 15:09.515
Modern books.

15:09.895 --> 15:14.001
We got a letter stock of by the reading for the book.

15:14.318 --> 15:18.184
There's a Dutch association for the booksellers.

15:18.204 --> 15:21.689
And they gave them a small stock of books to sell.

15:22.811 --> 15:27.878
These were not Jewish booksellers, these were Dutch booksellers.

15:28.059 --> 15:30.202
There was a Dutch booksellers, no.

15:30.662 --> 15:31.704
So they helped you?

15:32.044 --> 15:33.366
Yes.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.654
Some reference material they got and some stock.

15:38.674 --> 15:40.958
And that's it.

15:40.978 --> 15:42.320
So then how did he build?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.241
How did he...?

15:43.261 --> 15:43.802
Slowly, but...

15:44.120 --> 15:46.082
Slowly, slowly.

15:46.703 --> 15:52.068
How big was the forraad?

15:52.088 --> 15:52.949
How big was the forraad?

15:52.969 --> 15:53.710
A couple of hundred books.

15:54.090 --> 15:55.932
That's it.

15:55.952 --> 16:03.620
But the first time I saw a file, a file of people when we opened.

16:04.861 --> 16:06.342
What did he say?

16:06.542 --> 16:14.110
When we opened there was a queue of people waiting when they opened.

16:14.360 --> 16:14.760
Really?

16:14.780 --> 16:19.605
Because people, of course, all hunger for books.

16:19.685 --> 16:20.606
Dutch people?

16:20.626 --> 16:21.107
Yeah.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.170
Dutch people, of course.

16:24.190 --> 16:24.911
This was in 1946, 45?

16:24.931 --> 16:25.071
46.

16:25.091 --> 16:25.271
46.

16:25.291 --> 16:25.732
46.

16:25.872 --> 16:30.156
Here in Amsterdam?

16:30.236 --> 16:31.537
Yeah.

16:32.038 --> 16:33.159
There was a queue of people.

16:33.760 --> 16:33.860
Yeah.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.101
Now, how about the other book?

16:35.421 --> 16:37.904
Didn't the other booksellers stay in business during the war?

16:39.826 --> 16:42.949
Yes, most of them did.

16:43.958 --> 16:51.386
But they can't have made a lot of money because the people's first interest was of course in food and drink.

16:51.406 --> 16:59.415
So the war is over and were these collectors who were queued up or just people who liked to read?

16:59.435 --> 17:03.559
No, the collectors were but no books.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.761
There were collectors but no books.

17:06.603 --> 17:08.505
Book collectors were more books.

17:08.525 --> 17:10.167
There were more book collectors than books, yeah.

17:10.187 --> 17:13.290
There were more book collectors than books.

17:14.485 --> 17:16.828
And what kinds of things were they looking for?

17:17.329 --> 17:18.130
What kinds of books?

17:19.211 --> 17:20.733
The best books.

17:20.753 --> 17:21.194
As ever.

17:22.155 --> 17:24.077
As always, the best books, as always.

17:24.858 --> 17:27.462
All collectors try to find, try to locate the best books.

17:28.303 --> 17:41.680
So where did you start going to find books beyond your colleagues who gave you a small... A few options, but not many.

17:43.603 --> 17:44.003
Not many.

17:44.692 --> 17:51.320
So what was it that helped you come back and become very successful?

17:51.761 --> 17:56.747
What is it in the nature of a bookseller?

17:59.090 --> 18:01.833
The quality I'm looking for, yeah.

18:01.853 --> 18:06.058
You tried to find books to sell.

18:06.358 --> 18:08.902
There's a profit you made, you bought other books.

18:10.143 --> 18:11.745
Whatever it is, you know.

18:13.632 --> 18:16.835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.679
You buy, you sell, and you make a profit.

18:21.079 --> 18:23.682
And from the profit, you try to buy other books.

18:23.862 --> 18:29.688
Other books, and better books, and the books you've always wanted to sell and buy.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.291
Because this, of course, after what was only a start.

18:33.311 --> 18:34.973
After 50 years.

18:35.333 --> 18:39.898
And you have to get back, you have to get into the direction of the books you'd like to buy and sell.

18:39.978 --> 18:42.981
Because what they started with was, of course, not what they really

18:43.737 --> 18:45.959
One people, their heart was in.

18:46.079 --> 18:48.622
What kinds of books did you have before the war?

18:48.702 --> 18:50.043
What kinds of books were lost?

18:51.865 --> 18:54.027
Oh yeah, lots of books.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.129
All kinds of books.

18:55.149 --> 18:57.191
But also, but also, but very old.

18:57.211 --> 18:58.412
But it was 16 and 17 eeel.

18:59.193 --> 19:00.854
16 and 17 eeel, the vroege forraad.

19:03.537 --> 19:05.439
A lot of 16th, 17th century, 18th century.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.100
Really?

19:07.381 --> 19:09.323
Yeah, I love that.

19:09.522 --> 19:11.844
And you still have no idea where these books are?

19:12.425 --> 19:13.746
No, you can't.

19:14.047 --> 19:24.818
Well, part of it she put on a blanket in a garden and I let it stay.

19:24.858 --> 19:38.112
Yeah, part of the stock they just removed from the premises and they put them outside in wind and rain under a sheet of stuff and it just went to room.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.935
What was the name of the store before the war?

19:41.456 --> 19:43.557
It was the same as it is now.

19:44.058 --> 19:44.518
Really?

19:44.538 --> 19:45.119
Yeah.

19:45.139 --> 19:47.121
It was doing NV, yeah, Bemis or NV.

19:47.761 --> 19:51.165
Then it was an NV, which is a sort of a large holding company.

19:51.265 --> 19:55.889
Now it's called BV, which is American, I think, a limited corporation.

19:56.610 --> 19:56.730
I see.

19:56.750 --> 19:57.530
Bemis or BV.

19:58.031 --> 20:01.434
And it was Bemis or NV before the war.

20:01.674 --> 20:05.618
So this is, in fact, the old family business.

20:06.222 --> 20:07.623
So this is the continuation?

20:07.703 --> 20:09.024
Yes, yes.

20:10.646 --> 20:23.276
My father started about 100 years ago and... Does Mr. Israel have children who will continue?

20:23.717 --> 20:23.857
No.

20:28.201 --> 20:30.022
This is a beautiful building, I have to say.

20:30.082 --> 20:35.086
This building here is... Well, I didn't know it is from a society.

20:35.106 --> 20:35.807
It's a society.

20:36.040 --> 20:40.605
society for... who was a famous architect.

20:41.867 --> 20:47.674
And they own about 70-75 houses in Amsterdam which they take care of.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.455
And we rent it.

20:49.256 --> 20:55.543
I never thought I could rent this shop.

20:56.524 --> 20:57.485
And he's been rebuilding.

20:57.886 --> 21:01.390
About 25 years.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.783
In 1970 I started here.

21:04.923 --> 21:05.143
1970.

21:05.163 --> 21:24.627
And before is that a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

21:25.130 --> 21:26.091
For booksellers.

21:26.111 --> 21:27.172
For booksellers, yes.

21:27.573 --> 21:28.554
That's a Rockefeller building.

21:28.574 --> 21:29.254
You don't know anything?

21:29.274 --> 21:30.276
Yes, yes, I've been there.

21:30.776 --> 21:31.557
Same thing.

21:31.637 --> 21:35.401
It started here and then I did not check up.

21:35.621 --> 21:36.562
It didn't work.

21:36.582 --> 21:37.263
It didn't work.

21:37.904 --> 21:39.826
And so I... How long is that?

21:39.986 --> 21:42.168
A year?

21:42.288 --> 21:42.849
About a year.

21:43.610 --> 21:45.472
And then in 1970 I took it over.

21:46.853 --> 21:49.496
So at the age, you're 81 years old now?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.217
81, yes.

21:50.397 --> 21:50.798
81.

21:50.898 --> 21:53.220
And you're still, you're still working every day?

21:53.280 --> 21:55.002
Yes, I do.

21:55.420 --> 21:59.965
I love it.

22:00.405 --> 22:03.028
And what gives you your greatest satisfaction?

22:03.408 --> 22:04.229
To find books.

22:05.050 --> 22:06.231
To find books.

22:08.454 --> 22:09.655
Extraordinary books.

22:09.675 --> 22:11.056
Books that matter.

22:11.076 --> 22:12.658
And how do you know that?

22:12.898 --> 22:15.421
How do you know a book that's important when you see it?

22:16.142 --> 22:17.563
Where does that come from?

22:17.763 --> 22:18.424
Experience.

22:20.126 --> 22:21.327
Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.

22:22.336 --> 22:26.100
So at the age of 81, you still get excited when you find a good book?

22:26.601 --> 22:27.182
Sure!

22:29.144 --> 22:32.087
And you see it in him?

22:32.848 --> 22:34.310
What's the response?

22:34.330 --> 22:41.017
It's when we buy at auction, for instance, and we get the parcel home, five or six books, and then the real work starts.

22:41.258 --> 22:45.082
Bibliographically, you dive into it and try to find out what's in it.

22:45.703 --> 22:48.546
And the first hunch sometimes is the best.

22:48.965 --> 23:18.533
excellent books also less less good books but mostly the books are very good and then you check it and you find out this is a major book medically scientifically and that's that's what you're looking for that's when you're happy and then the nice part is perhaps even over the finding it and the buying it that's the nice part and then then it has to wait for a customer now at the age of 81 are you buying for stock yes you're buying for stock yes still do isn't that great

23:18.985 --> 23:20.007
I love that.

23:21.329 --> 23:25.515
Not in huge amounts, but we try to keep up.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.139
But you understand what I'm saying.

23:28.540 --> 23:33.187
But he's going to buy the book.

23:33.527 --> 23:34.869
Yes.

23:34.949 --> 23:37.253
That's the key point.

23:37.273 --> 23:40.938
You're not thinking of a particular customer, is what I'm trying to say.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.846
Dangerous.

23:45.866 --> 23:47.288
The book has to be...

23:48.331 --> 23:49.292
It has to stand or fall.

23:49.312 --> 23:50.113
The book is important.

23:51.155 --> 23:55.440
It's a funny thing to say, but the customer is perhaps even less important.

23:56.622 --> 24:01.728
The customer will eventually come for this particular book.

24:01.748 --> 24:06.094
But the book has to be a very good book.

24:06.234 --> 24:07.435
It has to be a top book.

24:07.535 --> 24:08.897
Now, where do you go to the auctions?

24:09.117 --> 24:10.339
Where are the auctions?

24:11.781 --> 24:12.702
London.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.193
He travels?

24:14.414 --> 24:17.777
No, no, no.

24:17.918 --> 24:21.121
We bid by commission or people who visit for us.

24:21.762 --> 24:23.003
So you look at catalogs?

24:24.004 --> 24:24.225
Yes.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.647
Major part of the day.

24:27.408 --> 24:30.832
And you decide the books that you want?

24:32.534 --> 24:34.436
Check it bibliographically, reference.

24:34.677 --> 24:42.165
Yeah, and check how rare it is and how nice and how important.

24:42.432 --> 24:47.900
I look for books which more or less changed the world.

24:49.062 --> 24:53.869
In a certain... Scientific metaphor, right?

24:53.889 --> 24:55.010
In a certain amount, you know.

24:55.871 --> 25:02.441
It is... It's a book... Inventions, for instance.

25:02.461 --> 25:03.442
What makes the world better.

25:04.644 --> 25:08.189
Can you give me some examples of books that changed the world?

25:08.850 --> 25:11.494
Helmholtz, for instance, or The Augenspiegel.

25:11.947 --> 25:16.513
on the eyes, the ophthalmoscope, small, which is still used today.

25:17.414 --> 25:19.477
Jenner on the cowpox.

25:19.557 --> 25:21.520
Jenner, for instance, on cowpox.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.442
Can you just write down some of these points?

25:23.462 --> 25:25.805
Sure, there are a couple of them in the catalog too.

25:26.206 --> 25:26.907
Okay, good.

25:26.927 --> 25:29.190
Maybe you could just check them off for me in the book.

25:31.913 --> 25:35.338
The Helmholtz, Auswriting the Craft.

25:38.542 --> 25:41.045
So books... Well, the science figures.

25:43.087 --> 25:46.030
We changed the science.

25:46.050 --> 25:50.495
How did you develop a specialty in science and that?

25:50.515 --> 25:57.462
Well, during my time that I was hidden, I had to do something.

25:57.502 --> 26:06.051
So I studied and I took medicine and history of sciences I took as a subject.

26:07.988 --> 26:10.291
Well how did you study while you were in hiding?

26:10.451 --> 26:11.592
Did you have books available?

26:11.772 --> 26:13.594
I had a few books with me.

26:15.857 --> 26:18.220
So you were hiding and you had books with you?

26:18.600 --> 26:23.346
Yes, a small box.

26:23.626 --> 26:27.110
So he studied while he was in hiding?

26:28.051 --> 26:32.376
You had to, of course, get through the day.

26:33.031 --> 26:35.093
That was, that was of major importance.

26:35.113 --> 26:37.956
Where did he have the, did people bring books to him?

26:38.016 --> 26:39.917
Have people brought you books?

26:39.937 --> 26:40.998
No, no.

26:42.099 --> 26:42.300
No.

26:42.320 --> 26:42.640
No.

26:42.660 --> 26:42.780
No.

26:42.800 --> 26:42.960
No.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.240
No.

26:43.260 --> 26:43.421

26:43.521 --> 26:43.581

26:43.621 --> 26:43.861

26:44.862 --> 26:45.042
No.

26:45.322 --> 26:45.583

26:45.603 --> 26:45.723

26:45.743 --> 26:45.943
No.

26:46.003 --> 26:46.063
No.

26:46.083 --> 26:46.223
No.

26:46.303 --> 26:46.563

26:48.605 --> 26:48.846
No.

26:48.866 --> 26:49.026

26:52.209 --> 26:52.309
No.

26:52.329 --> 26:52.569
No.

26:52.589 --> 26:52.789
No.

26:53.210 --> 26:53.310
No.

26:53.330 --> 26:53.430
No.

26:53.510 --> 26:53.610
No.

26:53.630 --> 26:53.690

26:53.790 --> 26:53.850

26:53.990 --> 26:54.110

26:54.170 --> 26:54.351

26:54.431 --> 26:54.491
No.

26:54.531 --> 26:54.631
No.

26:54.651 --> 26:54.711
No.

26:54.771 --> 26:54.891
No.

26:54.931 --> 26:55.191
No.

26:55.211 --> 26:55.372
No.

26:55.392 --> 26:55.552
No.

26:55.572 --> 26:55.672
No.

26:55.952 --> 26:56.012
No.

26:56.032 --> 26:56.092
No.

26:56.112 --> 26:56.172
No.

26:56.192 --> 26:56.252

26:56.272 --> 26:56.332

26:56.352 --> 26:56.413

26:56.493 --> 26:56.553

26:56.573 --> 26:56.733
No.

26:56.753 --> 26:56.813
No.

26:56.833 --> 26:56.893
No.

26:56.913 --> 26:56.973
No.

26:56.993 --> 26:57.173
No.

26:57.193 --> 26:57.293
No.

26:57.353 --> 26:57.453
No.

26:57.473 --> 26:57.594
No.

26:57.614 --> 26:57.774

26:57.894 --> 26:57.974

26:58.955 --> 26:59.015
No.

26:59.035 --> 26:59.095
No.

26:59.115 --> 26:59.175
No.

26:59.195 --> 26:59.315
No.

26:59.575 --> 26:59.676
No.

26:59.696 --> 26:59.796
No.

26:59.876 --> 26:59.996
No.

27:00.016 --> 27:00.076
No.

27:00.096 --> 27:00.156
No.

27:00.176 --> 27:00.336
No.

27:00.356 --> 27:00.516
No.

27:00.536 --> 27:00.636
No.

27:00.656 --> 27:00.877
No.

27:00.897 --> 27:00.957
No.

27:01.177 --> 27:01.237
No.

27:01.257 --> 27:01.317
No.

27:03.203 --> 27:04.304
He wasn't caught.

27:04.725 --> 27:05.646
That one wasn't caught.

27:06.807 --> 27:11.973
Another one was caught, yeah?

27:14.376 --> 27:17.620
So for all the time you were in hiding?

27:18.621 --> 27:19.602
Yes, I studied.

27:19.622 --> 27:20.163
You studied.

27:21.424 --> 27:22.425
You have to do something.

27:22.986 --> 27:30.595
I don't know, if you know, if you have 12 hours before you.

27:32.093 --> 27:36.357
And, and... You were in a farmhouse, you said, in Heidegger?

27:36.437 --> 27:38.780
A small... No, it was not a farmhouse.

27:39.160 --> 27:44.025
It was a very small... ...house.

27:44.245 --> 27:50.231
In the, in the... In the center of a wood... What was it?

27:50.351 --> 27:52.473
A forester.

27:52.513 --> 27:55.136
The man taking care of the... It was a forester.

27:55.416 --> 27:59.400
Just give me an idea of where that is.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.891
With regard to where we are now, Arnhem, was it close to Arnhem?

28:03.131 --> 28:06.034
Yeah, it was, uh, 30 miles from Arnhem.

28:06.094 --> 28:08.157
Fifteen miles, or 30 kilometers.

28:08.638 --> 28:10.300
About 15 miles in the woods.

28:11.521 --> 28:12.722
In the woods.

28:12.963 --> 28:20.151
Around Arnhem, that's the only place in Holland where it would have some importance, because the rest of Holland is all flat.

28:20.171 --> 28:22.354
And what kind of a house does a forester have?

28:22.374 --> 28:24.356
Is it like a... It's a fastball.

28:24.376 --> 28:27.480
Fastball, but secluded, secluded.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.463
Was the forester a friend of your family's?

28:29.623 --> 28:29.843
No.

28:30.177 --> 28:33.581
I got by luck.

28:36.324 --> 28:38.786
If you will overcome such a thing, you have to have luck.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.949
The only thing that you need.

28:42.871 --> 28:45.453
If you go to Switzerland, you have to have luck.

28:45.533 --> 28:47.556
Or bad luck.

28:47.596 --> 28:53.502
But to come through such a while, you have to have luck.

28:55.135 --> 28:57.438
And you lost family members, I understand.

28:57.478 --> 28:57.959
Hmm?

28:58.139 --> 28:59.802
You lost members of your family.

29:02.085 --> 29:02.306
Yeah.

29:02.546 --> 29:13.182
My mother was caught, and my oldest brother, and three of my sisters.

29:13.202 --> 29:16.126
Did you know this during the war, or did you find out afterwards?

29:17.508 --> 29:21.114
Well, you wasn't so, no.

29:21.655 --> 29:24.619
You didn't realize it before.

29:25.257 --> 29:30.542
Well, that you see with all people who come in an occupation, you know.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.324
They don't know what happens.

29:32.344 --> 29:33.125
Nobody knows.

29:35.988 --> 29:39.191
And your younger brother, where was he during the war?

29:39.271 --> 29:49.821
How did, how did he... Yeah, well, it's a whole story, but he went... He married, and then he went to Switzerland.

29:50.262 --> 29:51.243
Oh, he was in Switzerland.

29:51.263 --> 29:52.764
Yeah, he has a connection there.

29:52.864 --> 29:53.745
He had connections.

29:54.063 --> 30:01.993
who brought him... to the next of the war, you two were reunited?

30:02.033 --> 30:03.315
No.

30:04.877 --> 30:10.484
He was in the army and... Well, that's another story.

30:10.504 --> 30:11.585
He'll tell you this afternoon.

30:11.606 --> 30:14.109
He was on the phone just now, so... Oh, that was Nico then?

30:14.529 --> 30:15.991
Was he the brother?

30:16.011 --> 30:16.792
Did you tell him I'm here?

30:17.213 --> 30:20.577
I told you we were in conversation with you.

30:21.232 --> 30:22.654
Yes, I'm seeing it in a second.

30:22.894 --> 30:25.037
And I'll leave you to it, he said, so.

30:26.278 --> 30:26.679
Oh, good.

30:26.799 --> 30:27.880
This is quite a story.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.684
This is quite a... Yeah.

30:30.924 --> 30:33.187
Everybody has done a story about his life.

30:34.048 --> 30:34.529
Is that?

30:34.729 --> 30:35.590
Every man has a story.

30:35.610 --> 30:36.091
Every man.

30:36.471 --> 30:43.721
And to me, of course, you live to take... to pass on books, to find books.

30:44.341 --> 30:45.703
Mm-hmm.

30:46.527 --> 30:55.598
This is, this is a, you know, look at, look at the books, look at what you've done to... Well, I bought them the world over, I can tell you.

30:56.599 --> 30:56.700
Yeah.

30:56.720 --> 31:00.604
I was, I went to, you know, Europe was easy, easier.

31:01.165 --> 31:02.367
Then I went to America.

31:03.728 --> 31:07.633
And then I went to Japan.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.858
And then you were a publisher too.

31:11.918 --> 31:14.121
You, you became a publisher as well.

31:15.738 --> 31:19.321
Sure, a little bit.

31:19.421 --> 31:20.262
That's unusual.

31:20.322 --> 31:22.244
Look, it stopped raining outside.

31:23.825 --> 31:26.848
It's a miracle.

31:26.868 --> 31:33.373
I can send you a list of what we've reprinted and published.

31:34.655 --> 31:40.900
Here in Europe, it is unusual that an antiquary or bookseller also becomes a publisher.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.243
At a certain moment, it was a trance.

31:44.746 --> 31:46.609
There was a trend.

31:48.191 --> 31:56.303
It came up and all the print books, who were still good, were reprinted.

31:58.626 --> 32:12.746
Well, I got from an English friend of mine who gave me his ID.

32:12.927 --> 32:13.167
And

32:13.855 --> 32:16.699
How do you decide which books to reprint?

32:17.400 --> 32:42.073
Again, it's his knowledge that he gathered while he was studying and then

32:42.728 --> 32:43.890
How do you know a book is good?

32:44.511 --> 32:48.516
You know it just looking at it, when you pick it up, you say the books have to be good.

32:48.536 --> 32:49.037
How do you know?

32:49.097 --> 32:51.060
How do you know when a book is good?

32:51.100 --> 32:54.825
That is, well... Six cents.

32:54.845 --> 32:58.991
After 50 or 60 years, it becomes a six cents, I think.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.694
Well, it's a feeling.

33:00.714 --> 33:01.455
It's a feeling.

33:02.716 --> 33:03.618
It's a feeling.

33:04.279 --> 33:08.044
You start, you start, well... Ten years in the business now, but it's...

33:09.526 --> 33:21.021
I'm beginning to feel that I've got some ground under my feet at the moment, after 10 years, which is what you need, basically, at least, to get along in this place.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.663
What does Mr. Israel teach you?

33:23.324 --> 33:24.345
What have you learned from him?

33:25.547 --> 33:27.690
Books in general.

33:27.730 --> 33:35.500
Whenever there's a book in a catalogue, now it's less than before, but we used to walk to the reference shelves.

33:36.509 --> 33:38.371
could be in there, could be in there, could be in there.

33:38.431 --> 33:41.214
So you'll learn along the way.

33:41.294 --> 33:43.176
It's facts, facts, facts.

33:43.356 --> 33:45.198
You can only learn about it.

33:45.218 --> 33:46.559
Mostly you learn about practice.

33:46.579 --> 33:46.999
Practice.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.501
Handle the books.

33:49.442 --> 33:50.303
Handling the books.

33:50.323 --> 33:50.503
Yes.

33:50.783 --> 33:51.844
Find out why you don't.

33:51.904 --> 33:55.227
Buying and selling.

33:55.247 --> 33:57.349
Find out why you have to buy there.

33:58.310 --> 34:00.172
What's the most important thing in selling?

34:00.413 --> 34:04.997
Knowing what the book is so you can explain to the customer why it is important.

34:05.163 --> 34:09.688
Especially now, blind.

34:09.848 --> 34:19.738
Because we don't sell what you call nice beautiful bindings, for instance, are on a second category.

34:19.838 --> 34:24.343
Because what we need are the books that are of major importance, medically and scientifically.

34:25.203 --> 34:29.228
What they look like is perhaps, it's important but it's less important.

34:30.229 --> 34:34.613
If it's a unity of a major book in a major binding,

34:35.116 --> 34:54.137
in fantastic condition, that's lovely, that's the best you can have, but normally we're not very choosy about condition, because it has to be, the text has to be... Do you encounter books that are important, that you've never heard of before, but you know immediately are important when you see them?

34:54.498 --> 34:55.179
Does that happen?

34:56.180 --> 34:58.342
Or does he pretty much know the books when he sees them?

34:58.963 --> 35:01.866
No, sometimes you do it by intuition, you write them.

35:02.116 --> 35:03.278
Intuition.

35:03.338 --> 35:04.379
Intuition.

35:04.539 --> 35:05.120
It's a feeling.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.021
It's a good feeling.

35:06.261 --> 35:07.243
This is a book.

35:07.343 --> 35:09.946
Figure speeches are phenomenal.

35:09.966 --> 35:10.547
No, that's good.

35:11.568 --> 35:11.768
Yes.

35:11.989 --> 35:13.110
No, intuition is good.

35:13.751 --> 35:16.675
You have a feeling about a book that it's important.

35:17.736 --> 35:19.058
Of course, you have to know.

35:19.458 --> 35:28.270
And then, mostly you are right, but sometimes you are wrong.

35:28.290 --> 35:29.792
Who basically buys these books?

35:29.812 --> 35:30.773
What kinds of people?

35:31.327 --> 35:36.292
or librarians and collectors.

35:36.312 --> 35:44.399
But libraries, generally, and medical schools... Last few years, not so many buyers from the institutions, but... Why is that?

35:44.459 --> 35:47.882
Budgets have been cut dramatically, I think.

35:48.343 --> 35:53.588
A year or so ago, we dispatched this catalogue in 2,000 copies all over the world.

35:54.549 --> 35:56.070
Six or 700 to America.

35:56.630 --> 35:59.393
And we received, I think, two address corrections.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.585
from America, on six or seven hundred.

36:04.266 --> 36:06.148
And the major institutions were all there.

36:06.669 --> 36:07.650
The Library of Congress.

36:08.030 --> 36:08.911
And they didn't buy more.

36:08.951 --> 36:10.032
Nothing.

36:10.052 --> 36:10.632
Not a single bit.

36:11.713 --> 36:15.817
So that's a disappointment, but... The US is not buying.

36:15.837 --> 36:16.838
Do you have any idea why?

36:17.319 --> 36:19.381
I don't know.

36:19.401 --> 36:21.543
I know why, because they're putting their money into computers.

36:21.863 --> 36:23.144
Ah, I see.

36:23.184 --> 36:24.065
Information technology.

36:24.105 --> 36:27.068
Yeah, and it's very sad, but I'm writing about that too.

36:27.740 --> 36:28.541
You know.

36:28.701 --> 36:30.684
Whenever they do buy, it's the private people.

36:30.724 --> 36:32.606
It's the private collectors.

36:32.626 --> 36:34.008
So when have you noticed this trend?

36:35.810 --> 36:40.997
For how long have you noticed this trend that the medical schools and universities are buying as much as they used to?

36:41.017 --> 36:45.783
Yeah, well.

36:45.924 --> 36:50.650
Yeah, they got me in the subsidy.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.093
They haven't got the money.

36:53.113 --> 36:56.397
So last, I think, last time.

36:56.417 --> 36:57.038
Well,

36:58.705 --> 37:00.728
Yeah, private people in that too.

37:00.748 --> 37:10.661
But there are a lot of private collectors, especially medical men, psychologists, psychiatrists in America, and a lot of them on urologists, cardiologists.

37:10.701 --> 37:12.663
How important to you is condition?

37:14.265 --> 37:14.846
Very important.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.710
It is important.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.312
Condition is important to everyone, isn't it?

37:19.332 --> 37:19.993
Yes, it is.

37:20.013 --> 37:23.277
All right.

37:23.398 --> 37:26.822
But I still maintain that it's in our line of business, medical and scientific,

37:28.253 --> 37:35.660
Perhaps sometimes it's not as important as the text itself.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.944
It is the text.

37:38.964 --> 37:43.929
You don't think that you'll ever see any of these books scanned and put on computers, do you?

37:46.351 --> 37:47.252
Technology is there.

37:48.513 --> 37:57.282
It's possible that people won't be sitting in front of a visual display unit for six to eight hours a day.

37:58.308 --> 37:59.529
I thought that was my team.

37:59.609 --> 38:02.773
No, no, no, no.

38:02.873 --> 38:10.101
People will always want to handle books, smell the books, feel the books, and scan them with the brain.

38:10.842 --> 38:11.323
Like this.

38:11.343 --> 38:12.804
And that's much faster than a computer.

38:13.605 --> 38:14.747
Where is most of your business?

38:14.767 --> 38:16.188
Here or abroad?

38:16.288 --> 38:16.749
Outside.

38:16.769 --> 38:18.050
Yeah, outside.

38:18.651 --> 38:22.716
95% overall.

38:22.736 --> 38:25.699
What is the state of book culture in Holland?

38:27.164 --> 38:29.046
Book culture in general.

38:30.087 --> 38:31.709
Very good.

38:32.190 --> 38:35.113
The interest in books in general speaking, yeah, that's very good.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.016
Collecting is another matter.

38:39.378 --> 38:42.842
But the interest in books is very, very good.

38:43.223 --> 38:48.769
A lot of exhibitions, a lot of research, a lot of new publications every year, dozens of them.

38:49.791 --> 38:56.158
But the buying, the collectors... Do you ever expect to retire?

38:57.134 --> 38:58.816
Yes, I do.

38:58.836 --> 39:01.598
What do you think?

39:01.718 --> 39:04.901
I see a man who comes to work every day, is what I see.

39:07.443 --> 39:08.404
I like what I see.

39:09.785 --> 39:11.367
You've got the knowledge here.

39:11.427 --> 39:15.150
Why not use it?

39:15.811 --> 39:17.792
But you still get a great deal of satisfaction.

39:18.493 --> 39:22.597
When you find a great book, you're happy.

39:22.977 --> 39:25.099
We're all excited.

39:25.315 --> 39:28.319
You have a dash if you find a good book.

39:28.879 --> 39:31.823
There are so few good books in the world.

39:32.363 --> 39:33.605
There are so few good books?

39:33.905 --> 39:35.888
Yeah.

39:35.908 --> 39:37.309
Well, how many?

39:38.851 --> 39:43.777
A lot, of course, but how many can you get your hands on?

39:43.797 --> 39:46.680
See, we're having a good interview.

39:46.901 --> 39:47.561
What do you think?

39:49.844 --> 39:53.989
What areas do you think would be good for me to cover with him?

39:57.125 --> 40:04.372
Well, as scientists, I'm not so... My brother is my... I love my showy books.

40:05.774 --> 40:09.898
I'm not so sure.

40:10.058 --> 40:16.524
Showy books are what they say.

40:16.545 --> 40:19.207
Showy, is that what you say?

40:19.227 --> 40:23.031
They're really, really... When it's called a place,

40:24.715 --> 40:26.818
memorial bindings.

40:26.838 --> 40:33.086
And bindings and... I like the text.

40:33.107 --> 40:38.734
The text is, for me, the most important.

40:38.814 --> 40:43.521
So, I'm still trying to get the sense of discovery when you find a book.

40:45.363 --> 40:47.046
You say you see this with him every day.

40:47.426 --> 40:48.468
What happens?

40:48.628 --> 40:53.895
Tell me... Give me an example of a book, if you can just...

40:54.770 --> 41:04.104
pick a book that might represent a recent discovery, at the point at which you realise you have something really, really interesting, you know?

41:05.045 --> 41:12.456
Well, I think, you know that before, is that a decent task, as well as you don't buy it.

41:13.297 --> 41:13.958
What did he say?

41:13.998 --> 41:19.447
You have to know, when you see the book, well, I can give you one example without going into particulars.

41:19.467 --> 41:21.790
Look at the Kilmers name, the Kilmers.

41:22.934 --> 41:25.878
Kulmus is a book, a medical book.

41:25.958 --> 41:31.724
K-U-L-M-U-S.

41:32.445 --> 41:35.309
It's an anatomical book, an anatomical play, 1734.

41:37.191 --> 41:43.018
And it's a major book, a book of major importance because of the relationship between Holland and Japan.

41:43.919 --> 41:46.462
It was a basic text for the Japanese to translate.

41:47.103 --> 41:48.925
And we found the copy a couple of times ago.

41:50.187 --> 41:52.309
We saw it in the catalogue, and that's it.

41:52.389 --> 41:54.231
And you know, there's the Kulmus.

41:54.291 --> 41:55.071
We've never seen it.

41:55.091 --> 41:58.054
Miss Rizal has had it one time before, I think.

41:58.534 --> 41:59.375
It's quite rare.

42:00.016 --> 42:00.716
It's super rare.

42:01.517 --> 42:02.058
There it is.

42:02.678 --> 42:03.539
Staring you in the place.

42:03.579 --> 42:05.401
You all get all excited.

42:05.901 --> 42:08.623
And you can't find any other copies in the auction package.

42:08.643 --> 42:09.004
You can't.

42:09.404 --> 42:09.604
For years.

42:09.624 --> 42:11.626
You have to check in Amsterdam University.

42:11.666 --> 42:15.009
They have a copy, thank God, so we can check and look.

42:15.109 --> 42:18.592
And then the battle begins.

42:18.652 --> 42:19.333
It was an auction.

42:19.533 --> 42:21.476
It was an auction and we had it.

42:21.516 --> 42:24.139
Did everybody else, did other people know this was important?

42:24.159 --> 42:26.663
It was, it was relatively... Sure.

42:26.683 --> 42:28.585
I don't know if you can tell it.

42:28.765 --> 42:29.687
It was low profile.

42:29.887 --> 42:32.010
Well, I can tell you what it is.

42:32.330 --> 42:40.982
It is one of some books which are important for the development of religion in Japan.

42:41.422 --> 42:42.724
It's a basic text.

42:43.505 --> 42:45.568
On Western base.

42:46.389 --> 42:47.751
European Western base.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.802
But it's very important in Japan.

42:50.002 --> 42:57.070
Yes, because they translated the book and took it as the basis for anatomy in Japan.

42:57.310 --> 42:58.791
And you know roughly what the title is?

42:58.832 --> 43:00.874
Anatomische tafelum.

43:00.934 --> 43:01.795
Anatomical tables.

43:02.616 --> 43:05.499
Okay, I can check this out.

43:06.100 --> 43:09.183
And so this was being offered where at auction?

43:11.846 --> 43:14.269
That's a bit... How shall we say it?

43:14.289 --> 43:15.510
This is a bit...

43:16.300 --> 43:21.426
If we divulge that, the client who's bought it recently will be able to check back.

43:22.547 --> 43:23.989
That's a bit sensitive.

43:24.029 --> 43:24.910
It was abroad.

43:24.950 --> 43:26.292
That's good, I understand.

43:26.692 --> 43:28.955
But don't mind me asking.

43:28.975 --> 43:34.782
So you saw this thing in an auction abroad.

43:34.842 --> 43:41.670
We put in a bid by fax and that was amazing because we thought there's always a chance that you don't have it.

43:41.690 --> 43:42.971
And you don't really know what to bid.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.514
You don't really know how many contestants.

43:46.017 --> 43:47.418
And still we had it.

43:47.819 --> 43:48.439
So we were lucky.

43:49.620 --> 43:52.563
And then you sold it to an institution or to an individual?

43:52.603 --> 43:53.483
To an individual.

43:54.945 --> 43:55.725
Immediately?

43:56.766 --> 44:00.189
Who we knew wanted the book so very much.

44:00.409 --> 44:04.112
So before you passed it on, did you have a chance to look at it and handle it?

44:04.132 --> 44:04.312
Yes.

44:06.134 --> 44:07.435
How long did you keep it in-house?

44:07.515 --> 44:10.257
A couple, at least a month or two months.

44:10.278 --> 44:11.318
So you kept it for a while?

44:11.358 --> 44:13.120
Yes.

44:14.441 --> 44:15.602
And you charged it.

44:15.768 --> 44:19.793
That's a great example.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.717
That's what I'm looking for.

44:22.737 --> 44:26.002
It goes to a collector and you have to say goodbye to it.

44:26.022 --> 44:27.984
The most interesting book I had was Harvey.

44:28.966 --> 44:29.987
So tell me about Harvey.

44:31.048 --> 44:33.291
That's blood, that's the circulation of blood.

44:33.472 --> 44:34.753
The heart is a pump.

44:34.773 --> 44:36.215
Sixty-eight.

44:36.235 --> 44:38.058
One of the greatest books I've ever had.

44:39.740 --> 44:42.203
And how often has that passed through your hands?

44:42.644 --> 44:42.824
One.

44:43.865 --> 44:45.167
And where did you find that?

44:45.620 --> 44:50.625
Well, I was offered by a professor.

44:53.248 --> 44:54.710
I sold it to America.

44:55.350 --> 44:56.772
You sold it to America?

44:56.792 --> 44:59.254
To a collector again, or to a... Yeah, to a bookshelf.

44:59.815 --> 45:02.798
To a bookshelf.

45:02.818 --> 45:05.421
Who long along is that?

45:05.501 --> 45:06.081
It sure is.

45:06.101 --> 45:07.863
30 years ago.

45:07.883 --> 45:09.845
30 years ago.

45:10.726 --> 45:12.488
But so few copies are known of Harvey.

45:12.989 --> 45:14.310
It's a rare book.

45:14.392 --> 45:17.215
It's really a rare book, I mean, great book.

45:17.235 --> 45:19.957
That is a rare book, you know.

45:19.977 --> 45:29.506
And of course we talk about Copernicus and that, that, those... Also a rare book.

45:30.467 --> 45:37.054
So are there still many great books in private homes that people don't know about?

45:37.454 --> 45:41.698
I can tell you, it's very hard to find.

45:42.792 --> 45:50.740
But the last few years there's been a tendency to put a lot of private collections into the auction houses.

45:51.481 --> 45:57.186
So the dealers are sort of not in the game anymore.

45:57.466 --> 46:02.591
We've not been offered a really interesting good collection in recent times.

46:04.033 --> 46:08.017
Which is a pity because that's what you need every now and again.

46:08.537 --> 46:11.280
A good library with a few hundred good titles.

46:11.598 --> 46:13.119
It doesn't happen anymore.

46:13.179 --> 46:14.901
Most of the people go to auctions.

46:14.941 --> 46:19.586
They see that, they fetch nice, high prices, London, New York, anywhere, Germany.

46:20.647 --> 46:27.473
So you have to compete in the auction room instead of discussing... Are there still pretty good auctions here in Amsterdam?

46:27.753 --> 46:28.734
Or are they mostly abroad?

46:31.337 --> 46:36.942
The auctions that are important for us are mostly abroad.

46:36.962 --> 46:39.124
We have a couple of nice Dutch auction houses.

46:40.235 --> 46:43.918
We'll have some nice material every now and again, but... Good.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.462
You know, I think we've covered a lot.

46:47.642 --> 46:52.487
We've got an hour, which is... I'd love to take a couple of pictures, if he doesn't mind.

46:52.547 --> 46:52.747
Yeah.

46:53.247 --> 46:54.829
Applied just.

46:54.849 --> 46:55.530
Applied just.

46:55.550 --> 46:55.750
Sure.

46:57.872 --> 46:58.813
Excellent.

46:58.873 --> 46:59.834
So you've read my book?

47:00.574 --> 47:00.895
Yeah.

47:00.915 --> 47:01.415
Oh, good.

47:01.435 --> 47:02.917
I'm beginning to read it.

47:02.937 --> 47:03.237
I see.

47:03.257 --> 47:06.580
Well, you'll be in the new book, so...

47:06.863 --> 47:07.844
Yes.

47:11.007 --> 47:11.808
What do you think?

47:12.088 --> 47:15.812
You think this is a profession that will continue into the next century?

47:15.852 --> 47:17.233
You think there will be booksellers?

47:17.574 --> 47:19.396
Well, there will be booksellers, yes.

47:19.576 --> 47:20.397
I think so.

47:21.898 --> 47:24.080
Sure.

47:24.161 --> 47:28.405
It's the most interesting profession you can have in your life.

47:29.706 --> 47:36.533
Always interested in things, even in modern things, because everything has

47:36.800 --> 47:39.103
So I also got a nation with history.

47:41.866 --> 47:42.187
It's us.

47:42.747 --> 47:46.352
And you have a young associate here who's helping you in the business?

47:46.532 --> 47:46.692
Yes.

47:46.712 --> 47:48.614
Is this basically the shop, you two here?

47:48.634 --> 47:53.140
Do you have any... Yes, this is what we... I hope so.

47:53.160 --> 47:57.545
And one lady who helps us in the print room and with bookkeeping.

47:57.605 --> 47:59.508
So you work with prints as well?

48:00.008 --> 48:00.329
Yes.

48:00.989 --> 48:04.714
I'll set it now, only in... Sideline.

48:04.778 --> 48:09.164
That's important at the moment, because things are okay.

48:09.244 --> 48:10.866
These are the things that people collect.

48:10.886 --> 48:11.087
Yes.

48:12.388 --> 48:14.491
Or buy for a souvenir.

48:15.953 --> 48:16.794
This is terrific.

48:16.854 --> 48:19.238
And what was this book here, since I have a picture of it?

48:19.258 --> 48:19.959
It's a Bible.

48:19.979 --> 48:23.584
It's a pure Bible, beginning of the 18th century.

48:23.604 --> 48:27.269
In Holland, a Bible is a very important book.

48:28.230 --> 48:34.178
Every home in Holland has a Bible in any form.

48:35.373 --> 48:36.754
A little bit civilized.

48:36.774 --> 48:38.696
A Dutchman has a Bible in his family.

48:38.716 --> 48:40.297
No, but they're not rare books, are they?

48:40.878 --> 48:43.120
And yet the value is personal.

48:43.140 --> 48:46.283
Apart from the very early ones, the Bible isn't really a rare book.

48:47.263 --> 48:50.927
But some of them are excruciatingly rare.

48:52.468 --> 48:57.032
But then you begin, well, the early German Bibles, of course.

48:57.052 --> 49:01.316
Of course, there must be great association books, which people have written.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.177
Well, it says half a pint.

49:03.498 --> 49:05.059
Association books are very hard.

49:06.794 --> 49:08.536
Let me ask you a question.

49:08.556 --> 49:10.918
There was a book published in Holland last year.

49:11.518 --> 49:13.820
Did Libri in an interesting fashion?

49:15.422 --> 49:18.765
I don't, but I did an interview with Pierre Bérez in France.

49:18.785 --> 49:20.106
Oh, yeah, I can understand.

49:20.246 --> 49:21.607
And he went crazy about it.

49:21.627 --> 49:24.970
He said he thinks Libri was a brilliant bookman.

49:25.751 --> 49:25.891
He was.

49:25.911 --> 49:27.673
Oh, he was, sure.

49:27.813 --> 49:29.454
And he said to me, you have to read this.

49:29.615 --> 49:30.916
And a scientist.

49:30.936 --> 49:34.799
And I said, I couldn't believe he was showing so much admiration for this thief.

49:35.180 --> 49:36.801
I couldn't.

49:37.287 --> 49:46.601
As a matter of fact, as a man who did no books, well, I can tell you it was one of the best of the sometimes.

49:46.781 --> 49:47.923
Libri was one of the best.

49:48.744 --> 49:51.048
So you have respect for his mind.

49:51.268 --> 49:53.812
For his mind, but not for his actions.

49:53.872 --> 49:57.677
That is interesting, the booksellers respect.

49:58.198 --> 50:01.723
Beres said, he said, read this book, read the man's knowledge.

50:01.864 --> 50:05.329
So that's why I've been... He was also a great man.

50:05.349 --> 50:06.130
Is this a nation?

50:06.380 --> 50:08.143
Yeah, it's by Verloren, from Hilversum.

50:08.203 --> 50:11.948
It's brand new, and I saw it a few years.

50:12.128 --> 50:13.691
Nobody has it in the United States.

50:13.871 --> 50:15.253
I have it at home, too.

50:15.273 --> 50:16.855
And I figured, well, while I'm here, I'll try.

50:16.976 --> 50:19.139
But if you can get it and send it to me.

50:19.379 --> 50:21.062
Is it in Dutch, or isn't it?

50:21.102 --> 50:21.883
No, it's in English.

50:22.203 --> 50:22.924
It's in English.

50:23.025 --> 50:26.089
It's a collaboration between a Dutch author and, I think, Italian.

50:26.109 --> 50:28.753
And it had a wonderful review on the book collector, too.

50:28.773 --> 50:29.334
Yeah.

50:29.354 --> 50:36.184
It had a huge... But you have to have the time to read it, because it's... I'm not wrong going, but it's...

50:36.569 --> 50:37.851
You have to dig into it.

50:37.871 --> 50:38.372
How about you say?

50:38.472 --> 50:39.854
Trenchant might be the word.

50:40.074 --> 50:41.736
Yeah, because there's a lot of information.

50:43.398 --> 50:46.583
So I can contact you for... You can take these two.

50:46.643 --> 50:47.504
I can take these two.

50:48.405 --> 50:51.910
Any extra information you'd like, please call us.

50:52.131 --> 50:52.852
This is wonderful.

50:54.013 --> 50:55.996
And it stopped raining, too.

51:00.442 --> 51:03.466
And so he usually needs them at one o'clock.

51:03.547 --> 51:06.070
And lunch, and then from half-past two to...

51:06.674 --> 51:10.160
So he puts in a pretty good day?

51:10.180 --> 51:10.420
Yes.

51:10.500 --> 51:15.829
And what is a typical day like for you here in the store?

51:15.969 --> 51:16.610
What does it involve?

51:16.630 --> 51:16.770
Mail.

51:16.790 --> 51:19.134
A stack of mail.

51:19.154 --> 51:19.535
Checking.

51:19.555 --> 51:20.476
And then the catalogues.

51:20.776 --> 51:21.618
Reading, reading, reading.

51:21.758 --> 51:22.519
Reading catalogues.

51:22.780 --> 51:23.120
Checking.

51:23.581 --> 51:24.442
Reading catalogues.

51:24.522 --> 51:25.204
And then checking.

51:25.865 --> 51:29.330
Finding an item you'd like to check further.

51:30.252 --> 51:31.794
Reference library, reference library.

51:31.814 --> 51:33.036
Do you find things?

51:33.202 --> 51:33.743
Every day?

51:33.783 --> 51:38.608
Every day, no.

51:38.808 --> 51:43.774
Sometimes you check a catalog with a thousand items and there's really nothing worthwhile in it.

51:43.794 --> 51:45.336
And who writes the catalogs, the two of you?

51:47.058 --> 51:50.081
This last one, I've done a lot.

51:50.101 --> 51:50.301
You did.

51:51.322 --> 51:54.426
And how extensive is your research library?

51:55.087 --> 51:58.991
Pretty, 2600, about 3000 items.

51:59.011 --> 52:01.774
And how important is a good research reference library?

52:02.682 --> 52:04.884
Without it we couldn't be in business.

52:05.065 --> 52:09.269
I have a small reference library myself at home, about 2300.

52:09.529 --> 52:13.613
I've been building that for 10 years.

52:13.633 --> 52:14.474
It's essential.

52:14.975 --> 52:18.639
Because you can't know everything.

52:18.979 --> 52:22.122
You know a lot, but you have to check a lot.

52:22.142 --> 52:24.625
You have to know where to check, that's important.

52:24.825 --> 52:25.846
Nobody can know all.

52:26.847 --> 52:28.069
Has the internet helped you a lot?

52:28.549 --> 52:32.233
Not yet, because we haven't got a computer yet.

52:32.551 --> 52:34.493
We're on the net, but we don't use a computer.

52:34.513 --> 52:36.676
I have a computer at home, which I use.

52:36.776 --> 52:37.597
Yeah, you'll find.

52:37.637 --> 52:41.681
Is it difficult to surf the net?

52:41.761 --> 52:42.482
Is it worthwhile?

52:42.502 --> 52:45.545
Do you find what you're looking for?

52:45.766 --> 52:46.446
It's getting better.

52:47.568 --> 52:49.910
The structures in it will have to improve.

52:49.970 --> 52:53.915
The thing is, you can check that you can get onto the Biotech National catalog.

52:53.975 --> 52:54.716
And Harvard.

52:55.276 --> 52:58.660
I do all my work with Harvard from home.

52:59.264 --> 53:01.146
So I check their catalog.

53:01.206 --> 53:03.830
So when I get there, I go straight in to the books.

53:03.870 --> 53:04.791
I don't fool around.

53:05.131 --> 53:06.052
I know if they have it.

53:06.072 --> 53:07.734
It would be a major tool for us to check.

53:07.754 --> 53:09.276
It's a good library.

53:09.617 --> 53:12.180
Yeah, but also I check the catalog on the computer.

53:12.961 --> 53:13.301
At home.

53:13.742 --> 53:14.262
On the internet.

53:14.382 --> 53:17.807
Want meneer heeft het internet.

53:17.827 --> 53:18.748
How heet het?

53:18.808 --> 53:21.191
De print van het scherm had hij bij zich.

53:21.231 --> 53:25.536
Daarom heeft hij ons naam en adres en alles ook gevonden.

53:25.616 --> 53:26.477
It's a major tool.

53:26.497 --> 53:27.258
It's going to be a major tool.

53:27.278 --> 53:28.900
And then for this new book that I'm writing.

53:29.588 --> 53:30.229
Simon here.

53:31.510 --> 53:36.835
And you were saying that you studied English literature at the University of Amsterdam, and then you studied library... Yeah, book and library science.

53:36.895 --> 53:38.177
Book and library science.

53:38.777 --> 53:42.081
Also... But there you only learned the basic things about typography.

53:42.101 --> 53:43.943
And that was where, also at Amsterdam?

53:44.063 --> 53:45.244
Amsterdam University.

53:45.304 --> 53:45.504
Okay.

53:45.584 --> 53:51.010
But then, you also said at that point you made a decision in order to deal with books and not be a teacher, I guess.

53:51.030 --> 53:58.077
And at first I tried to get into the public libraries or the scientific libraries, a job there in the rare book department, but

53:58.563 --> 54:00.966
as it went in Holland at that time, ten years ago.

54:01.006 --> 54:04.810
No budgets, no people who had positions.

54:06.072 --> 54:06.893
So I thought, what now?

54:07.614 --> 54:15.183
And the next thing I did was write to, I think 20, 25 antiquarian booksellers in Holland, presenting myself.

54:17.786 --> 54:22.251
And there were a few reactions, 10 or 12 letters back, I'm sorry, no people needed.

54:22.311 --> 54:25.194
And Miss Riesel phoned me, all of a sudden out of the blue.

54:25.775 --> 54:27.557
Somebody's leaving my firm and...

54:28.111 --> 54:30.994
Would you like to come for a conversation?

54:31.014 --> 54:31.855
I'm a doctor analyst.

54:31.875 --> 54:35.719
So I finished university and didn't write my dissertation.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.281
He's not at home?

54:37.301 --> 54:39.924
You can give a try later on in the day.

54:39.944 --> 54:41.846
Maybe I could call the university too.

54:42.127 --> 54:44.089
Yeah, of course.

54:44.269 --> 54:47.112
Maybe if we could get the phone number of the university library.

54:47.432 --> 54:51.717
It's in the beginning.

54:51.737 --> 54:52.498
Thank you.
