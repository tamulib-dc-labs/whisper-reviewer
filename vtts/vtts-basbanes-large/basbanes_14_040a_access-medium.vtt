WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:13.178
We're in the treasure room with Mr. Herbert Tentred, and you were just introducing me to the contents of this poem.

00:13.198 --> 00:15.080
Why don't you just pick it up from there?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.242
Yeah.

00:16.262 --> 00:29.076
Well, we are here in the presence of 150 medieval manuscripts from the 10th to the 16th century, all of them complete or virtually complete.

00:30.220 --> 00:36.227
And among them, 30 or 40 of the finest manuscripts in private hands, still in private hands.

00:36.247 --> 00:50.423
We have here, for instance, the oldest known manuscript of one of the most important medical treatises of the Middle Ages.

00:52.105 --> 00:58.152
And these are the Cure of Johannes Platyarius, so the ways of healing.

00:58.452 --> 00:59.233
We need that all.

01:00.074 --> 01:00.455
I think so.

01:00.535 --> 01:02.277
The Curie of Johannes Platyarius.

01:02.958 --> 01:05.641
And this is the oldest known copy.

01:05.782 --> 01:07.063
It dates from 1180.

01:07.584 --> 01:11.549
So it's more than 800 years old.

01:11.990 --> 01:22.323
And what is even more important, it is not only the oldest known copy of this text, but it has also 18 miniatures in the margins.

01:22.824 --> 01:25.908
And this makes it uniqueer than unique.

01:25.948 --> 01:26.569
More unique.

01:26.870 --> 01:28.612
More unique, yeah.

01:29.013 --> 01:31.135
Because, yeah, curioser and curioser.

01:31.996 --> 01:40.947
Because the next oldest manuscript of this text known, which has miniatures, is from 1380.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.969
So this is the oldest surviving?

01:43.149 --> 01:48.596
It is the oldest surviving manuscript of this text in all libraries of the world.

01:48.616 --> 01:52.260
So do you think that the text comes to us from this copy?

01:52.400 --> 01:53.341
Is that possible?

01:53.501 --> 01:54.042
It may...

01:54.376 --> 01:55.417
Very well be.

01:55.797 --> 02:06.027
You know, I have an assistant who wrote his dissertation on this text, and he says, yeah, you can have that.

02:06.067 --> 02:06.507
May I?

02:06.527 --> 02:06.808
Of course.

02:06.828 --> 02:07.969
I'd like to find out who took that.

02:07.989 --> 02:10.731
I'd like to take a few pictures of you before I leave.

02:11.952 --> 02:15.216
But, you know, that looks like a gorgeous photograph.

02:15.236 --> 02:19.299
We might want to buy one of those from the photographer when the book comes out.

02:19.319 --> 02:22.122
Perhaps, yeah, I can...

02:22.709 --> 02:24.011
get you in contact with him.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.736
It's a little early yet.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.298
The book's still a couple years away.

02:29.899 --> 02:33.925
But I mean, I can provide you with these.

02:34.246 --> 02:36.549
I get them from him and you get them from me.

02:37.731 --> 02:45.021
So this is just one of the 140, 150 medieval manuscripts here.

02:45.423 --> 03:04.647
I know them quite well because yesterday and the day before and even today we did a lot of photographing about them for the new manuscripts that will be in my next catalogue, Leuch des Mittelalter, new series too, which will be out in December or so.

03:05.448 --> 03:07.571
And so you find everything, you see.

03:08.152 --> 03:13.759
This is a Greek synaxarion from Kosinitsa about...

03:14.127 --> 03:20.816
This is really very, very interesting.

03:21.697 --> 03:25.482
And the binding is from the 14th century.

03:26.063 --> 03:33.233
And it is complete.

03:34.951 --> 03:35.912
quite complete.

03:36.012 --> 03:44.802
I mean, of course it has heavy stains, but this has been read every day in the monastery.

03:45.263 --> 03:49.607
So, I mean, it is really a miracle that it should be complete.

03:49.627 --> 03:51.349
How do you find books like this today?

03:52.290 --> 04:03.523
Well, Mr. Bethbaines, I have to tell you that as the people, the functionaries from Schaffhausen, you, that I'm

04:04.246 --> 04:26.038
quite renowned in my field and nearly all of them they just call me they just come tomorrow afternoon I will be offered two new manuscripts so after having established this name for 15 years now and after H.P.

04:26.058 --> 04:33.949
Krauss who was renowned for having bought the best manuscripts over a span of 40-50 years

04:34.300 --> 04:35.962
He's dead now for 10 years.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.486
Well, I may say I took over.

04:39.348 --> 04:42.112
And then I published these catalogs.

04:42.693 --> 04:49.142
And so nearly everyone in the world who is interested in these things at least knows my name.

04:49.863 --> 04:53.288
And he knows that I'm paying the fairest prices.

04:53.829 --> 05:00.099
I'm paying the prices I would also be willing to pay at auction rooms.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.784
And of course, the seller,

05:04.135 --> 05:09.724
and the buyer are much happier not to have Sotheby's or Christie's in between.

05:09.764 --> 05:15.573
That removes them from the equation, so to speak.

05:16.675 --> 05:22.725
And of course, that's been a concern lately, where a lot of people have been going to Sotheby's and Christie's.

05:23.245 --> 05:31.138
Yeah, but I mean, Sotheby's and Christie's, you know, in the last six or seven years, they had one good collection, this back

05:34.848 --> 05:40.394
There were four or five large collections before on the market, and I bought them all.

05:40.414 --> 05:41.916
I bought them all.

05:42.076 --> 05:55.010
So Sollebys and Crites even thought of perhaps, well, rejoining the Western manuscript department with the book and manuscript department.

05:55.610 --> 06:03.859
So they needed that back collection desperately.

06:04.177 --> 06:11.064
As I told you, of the 50 manuscripts in my new catalog, about 40 I bought privately.

06:11.745 --> 06:15.929
And this is, of course, what it is all about.

06:19.233 --> 06:23.898
There are many manuscripts in it that have never appeared on the market.

06:23.918 --> 06:30.825
And there are manuscripts that you would not think of still being

06:31.261 --> 06:32.583
being available.

06:32.683 --> 06:37.208
I mean, this is a manuscript that was never in any auction.

06:37.628 --> 06:40.912
It was always in private.

06:41.373 --> 06:49.182
This is by one of the finest Spanish paintings of the 50th century.

06:49.202 --> 06:53.567
This is the so-called Greyston Master, the Master of the Greyston Prayer Book.

06:54.048 --> 06:55.970
And this is his masterpiece.

06:55.990 --> 06:58.293
It has 19 miniatures.

06:59.014 --> 07:00.255
And I bought this privately

07:04.167 --> 07:06.550
Look at these things.

07:06.570 --> 07:07.891
So how would you describe it?

07:07.991 --> 07:08.972
What was the name of that?

07:09.353 --> 07:10.134
How would you describe it?

07:10.354 --> 07:12.396
The Master of the Dresden Prayer Book.

07:12.416 --> 07:12.737
Okay.

07:12.777 --> 07:14.819
Dresden is that city.

07:15.139 --> 07:15.740
I know that.

07:16.541 --> 07:18.844
And the Master of Dresden is the very same.

07:18.864 --> 07:20.345
Yeah, Master of Dresden, of course.

07:20.445 --> 07:21.286
And it is him.

07:21.907 --> 07:26.192
And he is called after that Dresden Prayer Book, which has been flooded.

07:26.527 --> 07:30.252
in the Second World War, and is nearly destroyed now.

07:30.593 --> 07:41.849
So this now is the finest book of ours of the Grayston master still in... still extant.

07:41.950 --> 07:46.897
Extant, so actually better than anything that's even in a collection, you would say?

07:46.917 --> 07:47.858
Yeah, of course, of course.

07:48.459 --> 07:54.508
I mean, there's only the breviary of Isabella of Spain,

07:55.079 --> 07:58.882
in the British Library that you can compare with it, with this.

07:59.984 --> 08:03.487
But this is a breviary, and I'm talking of books of ours.

08:06.129 --> 08:11.314
Were you ever, you don't mind my jumping around with questions, by the way, were you ever a collector of things?

08:11.334 --> 08:12.175
Yes, of course.

08:12.235 --> 08:15.037
I mean, everyone starts as a collector, of course.

08:15.117 --> 08:23.365
And I'm even, I'm even planning of writing a book on collecting, you know, or a large essay or so.

08:23.581 --> 08:33.358
because I think that I should try to give this to other people that are interested in this.

08:33.378 --> 08:48.103
And so of course I started by collecting as a student and as an assistant at the University of Freiburg in Breisgau.

08:48.455 --> 09:01.599
Or I can give you a nice article written on me by a Swiss journalist in which the basic facts are very well... And they're accurate.

09:01.619 --> 09:02.881
Yeah, and they're accurate.

09:02.901 --> 09:04.584
This is what Kant knows.

09:04.685 --> 09:11.577
Well, people... The compliments I get on my book, I have to say, is I get my facts straight.

09:11.759 --> 09:20.037
We'll talk at some point, and I'll go over things, and I'll ask you stupid questions like, how old are you?

09:20.838 --> 09:23.604
Would you please spell this book?

09:23.725 --> 09:28.014
But we have to have accuracy.

09:28.174 --> 09:29.076
This is what counts.

09:41.678 --> 09:54.752
on book collecting, but just on that never-to-be-destroyed feeling and emotion of the man that he has to collect.

09:55.913 --> 09:59.937
So... Collecting at a certain level or collecting in general?

09:59.957 --> 10:00.958
No, no, in general.

10:00.998 --> 10:11.449
I mean, it always starts as the collecting of the three- or four-year-old boy or girl collecting stones or whatever.

10:11.783 --> 10:17.068
and then coins, and then stamps, postage stamps, and so on.

10:17.149 --> 10:24.616
I mean, even the sense of collecting has to be shaped, has to be evolved.

10:25.758 --> 10:31.904
And, well, I mean, I'm doing this now for exactly 20 years.

10:32.084 --> 10:33.325
This business, yes.

10:33.546 --> 10:40.693
I quit university in August 1977, and then I established myself

10:41.905 --> 11:07.963
together with my then girlfriend and afterwards my wife in Bavaria in a very remote corner of Bavaria because I had no money but I had a small collection of nice rather 20th century books

11:10.357 --> 11:11.979
No, I had no money whatsoever.

11:11.999 --> 11:13.061
That's important to understand.

11:13.081 --> 11:14.322
I had no money at all.

11:14.342 --> 11:17.807
Well, you mentioned Krauss, you mentioned Krauss, but everybody knows that.

11:17.947 --> 11:24.496
He married to one of the wealthiest women in England.

11:25.337 --> 11:27.620
He had a running start, at least.

11:27.681 --> 11:34.049
And in the 50s, Honey inherited about $30 million.

11:34.610 --> 11:39.857
With that kind of money behind me, I would have done even

11:39.938 --> 11:42.461
even more than Kraut, I think.

11:42.481 --> 11:45.985
But I mean... I'd like to pursue that.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.127
You're a very confident man.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.528
I love that, by the way.

11:48.649 --> 11:50.731
Yeah, I'm... I love risks, you know.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.693
You're not shy about... I run the risks.

11:52.994 --> 11:54.275
No, no, no, no.

11:54.295 --> 12:01.084
About, you know, you... But I started 20 years ago with no... How old started, by the way?

12:01.224 --> 12:05.048
Last week, I was 50 years.

12:05.068 --> 12:08.072
So I started in... with 30 years.

12:08.474 --> 12:17.046
And I had my studies at the university, and then I was at what we call Lehrstuhl as an assistant there.

12:18.228 --> 12:22.955
And I had a very bright future at the university.

12:22.995 --> 12:23.555
As a teacher?

12:23.656 --> 12:31.627
As a teacher, but romance languages, you know, literature, medieval romance literature, and so on.

12:31.647 --> 12:37.435
So old Italian, old Provençal, old French, and so on.

12:39.035 --> 12:44.543
I saw, after doing this for two or three years, I saw that this was not my world.

12:46.025 --> 13:04.553
And that my sense of evolution, my sense of getting things done and getting things created, this conflicted with that sense of

13:05.512 --> 13:09.615
being settled in the university.

13:10.136 --> 13:15.260
So I made up my mind and said, let's do something else.

13:16.221 --> 13:24.748
And in the beginning I wanted to start as a writer, as a poet.

13:25.769 --> 13:32.294
And then my grandfather said, well, but you are now establishing a family and will have children and so on.

13:32.675 --> 13:35.417
Don't you think, well, I appreciate your

13:38.620 --> 13:43.244
I said, don't you think you should have something to live on?

13:44.425 --> 14:04.204
And though my grandparents were not poor, but of course they knew that it is always better to help someone to earn his own money than to just give him the money.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.767
And I said, yes, I think you're right.

14:08.506 --> 14:26.177
As books and literature were my whole life, even then, they are more my whole life now, but even then, I thought that they were more.

14:35.523 --> 14:38.987
And, of course, dealing with books.

14:39.528 --> 14:47.437
But even then I was dedicated to books, to literature, the whole .

14:47.557 --> 14:54.765
And books.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.749
And I like fine books.

14:57.829 --> 15:01.092
I always liked fine books.

15:01.153 --> 15:02.074
Define fine.

15:02.494 --> 15:03.495
Yeah, yeah.

15:03.575 --> 15:05.057
Define fine for me, if you would.

15:05.408 --> 15:06.630
What to you is a fine book?

15:07.250 --> 15:14.219
Well, I mean... As Justice Holmes said, somebody asked of Justice of the Supreme Court, how do you know what pornography is?

15:14.239 --> 15:15.240
You know it when you see it.

15:15.561 --> 15:18.765
And I wonder if it's the same thing that applies to a fine book.

15:19.206 --> 15:25.874
But I mean, there are really refinements in defining a fine book, so to say.

15:26.495 --> 15:30.640
And I will, afterwards, I give you a nice

15:31.244 --> 15:32.746
a nice proof of it.

15:32.767 --> 15:33.227
Okay.

15:33.287 --> 15:34.089
This is very interesting.

15:34.109 --> 15:35.571
I've never explored this with anyone.

15:35.892 --> 15:36.833
Yeah, yeah.

15:36.953 --> 15:42.262
And this really is my field.

15:43.344 --> 15:44.025
I can tell you.

15:44.085 --> 15:45.127
This is my field.

15:45.147 --> 15:45.588
I know that.

15:47.030 --> 15:52.980
If you look around, I mean, here you have 150 medieval manuscripts.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.167
No one, I mean, the whole market of medieval manuscripts

16:07.053 --> 16:12.017
one-leaf miniatures, but of whole or virtually complete manuscripts.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.099
The whole market only consists of two hundred?

16:14.119 --> 16:17.162
Yeah, of two hundred thirty, two hundred forty manuscripts.

16:17.182 --> 16:21.285
But they haven't got more than fifteen manuscripts any longer.

16:21.966 --> 16:31.314
They don't have... I saw them when I was there last year, and they have from twelve to fifteen manuscripts.

16:31.334 --> 16:32.215
And I have two hundred.

16:34.397 --> 16:35.558
Of the two hundred and forty.

16:46.034 --> 16:46.615
And why not?

16:47.356 --> 16:53.625
I mean, I'm enjoying that, as long as I can afford it, of course.

16:53.645 --> 16:54.607
I mean, I have to sell.

16:55.468 --> 17:05.663
But there are also about 80 very fine incunabula, but very fine things, you know, not only incunabula printed before 15 of you.

17:06.217 --> 17:08.419
It's an incanabulum like that.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.983
It's a very important point because most incanabulum is junk.

17:12.144 --> 17:14.466
It just happens to be old.

17:14.586 --> 17:19.311
I would never lay my hand on a normal incanabulum.

17:19.692 --> 17:24.557
But this, for instance, is some sort of extraordinary.

17:25.038 --> 17:27.400
This is printed on vellum.

17:28.481 --> 17:32.426
So it's not paper, but it's vellum.

17:32.506 --> 17:34.468
And of course, this is the

17:34.972 --> 17:39.738
The Grazianos of Peter Schoeffer, who was the successor to Gutenberg.

17:39.778 --> 17:41.721
Peter Schoeffer, yes, successor to Gutenberg.

17:41.981 --> 17:47.248
And it has 38 miniatures painted in by the house bookmaster.

17:47.549 --> 17:49.151
Perhaps you know what the house is.

17:49.171 --> 17:54.558
And this is one of two printed books in which we know that the house bookmaster was involved.

17:54.959 --> 17:55.900
How do we know this?

17:56.302 --> 17:58.906
My technique?

17:59.306 --> 18:00.127
Yeah.

18:00.147 --> 18:05.395
My best friend and the one who writes my manuscript catalogs is Eberhard Koenig.

18:05.415 --> 18:11.263
He's a professor at the Free University of Berlin, and he's one of the foremost authorities.

18:11.343 --> 18:12.605
You have to spell his name for me.

18:12.766 --> 18:13.206
Koenig.

18:13.767 --> 18:17.652
It's K-O-E-N-I-G.

18:17.813 --> 18:18.474
And his first name?

18:19.075 --> 18:19.495
Eberhard.

18:19.856 --> 18:20.997
Eberhard Koenig.

18:21.017 --> 18:25.043
And he's one of the foremost authorities on book paintings.

18:25.462 --> 18:30.389
in the 15th century, and he had established this without any doubt.

18:30.409 --> 18:34.835
And there are 38... Look at the condition of this.

18:35.015 --> 18:37.359
There are 38 miniatures in it.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.104
Now, was that supposed to be a miniature of the... This is a miniature.

18:41.124 --> 18:44.068
I know, but you just went by a page that had a blank splat.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.370
This is an illumination.

18:46.511 --> 18:50.197
Illumination because solid gold is in it.

18:50.217 --> 18:52.600
This is illumination, this is illumination,

18:52.816 --> 18:59.202
This is just rubrication, the red and blue lumbar.

19:00.283 --> 19:01.725
And this is the miniature.

19:01.745 --> 19:03.486
And what do we call this book again?

19:03.506 --> 19:05.588
This is Grazianus.

19:05.608 --> 19:06.369
How is this book?

19:06.489 --> 19:09.092
The Decretum of Grazianus.

19:09.112 --> 19:14.136
G-R-A-T-E-A-N-U-S.

19:14.156 --> 19:14.977
Grazianus.

19:15.278 --> 19:20.983
And he's the founder of the ecclesiastical

19:21.284 --> 19:22.526
justice, you know.

19:23.288 --> 19:23.768
Decretum.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.091
Decretum.

19:25.411 --> 19:28.377
D-E-C-R-E-T-U-M.

19:28.657 --> 19:31.643
D-E-C-R-E-T-U-M.

19:31.883 --> 19:32.544
The Decretum.

19:32.664 --> 19:33.806
That's what you call this book.

19:34.027 --> 19:35.409
Yeah, this is the book.

19:35.510 --> 19:36.571
And this was printed where?

19:37.173 --> 19:37.653
In Mainz.

19:38.054 --> 19:39.116
In Mainz.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.238
1472.

19:41.467 --> 19:46.336
And you said Schaeffer was the printer, right?

19:46.357 --> 19:46.878
Schaeffer, yeah.

19:46.898 --> 19:48.380
Peter Schaeffer was the printer.

19:48.601 --> 19:51.967
Look, you see here, it's very famous.

19:52.969 --> 19:54.773
Printing marks.

19:54.853 --> 20:00.243
And you see here, Petrus Schaeffer, the longtime Continental Cutis.

20:00.264 --> 20:03.610
And here you see, Anno Incarnationis Dominici.

20:04.180 --> 20:04.941
1,472.

20:05.061 --> 20:05.281
Wow.

20:05.301 --> 20:13.189
That's touching something.

20:13.229 --> 20:18.094
He's one of the patron saints of printing.

20:18.174 --> 20:19.936
His fingerprints are just right.

20:20.016 --> 20:22.278
This is one of the finest books.

20:22.298 --> 20:24.360
This is one of three copies in the world.

20:24.621 --> 20:28.905
The others are in Munich, in the Bavarian State Library, and in Wolfsburg.

20:29.088 --> 20:33.996
This is one of the three copies on vellum that have been extensively illuminated, you know?

20:34.236 --> 20:51.382
All the others have only the first page painted in, but none of the 60 known copies has all the miniatures painted in, except the Munich, the Wolkenbüttel, and my copy.

20:51.723 --> 20:55.669
And my, one can say, is the finest of them all, because

20:55.953 --> 20:59.738
The Munich and the Wolfenbüttel copies have not this illumination.

20:59.878 --> 21:00.959
Where's Wolfenbüttel?

21:01.059 --> 21:03.082
Wolfenbüttel is near Hanover.

21:03.302 --> 21:03.703
Hanover.

21:04.303 --> 21:07.207
So the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel.

21:07.227 --> 21:07.968
It's very important.

21:11.172 --> 21:12.714
Look here.

21:12.734 --> 21:17.139
And the state of preservation... Does this come out of a private collection?

21:17.220 --> 21:19.182
I mean, without asking... Yeah, yeah.

21:19.262 --> 21:20.223
Without probing.

21:20.283 --> 21:22.526
It's a private collection, yeah.

21:22.546 --> 21:23.968
In northern Europe, yeah.

21:26.412 --> 21:31.538
Do you expect something like this to go into the hands of a private individual or to an institution?

21:31.598 --> 21:31.878
Always.

21:32.059 --> 21:35.282
No, I'm always selling to private individuals.

21:35.302 --> 21:39.327
I'm nearly never selling to libraries.

21:39.507 --> 21:48.278
And is that a matter of, well, I mean, I have been asked that very often, many times.

21:49.019 --> 21:54.445
And I think it is also a sort of prejudice on my side, you know.

21:54.678 --> 22:01.446
I like to sell to private individuals because I can buy them back, you know, sometimes.

22:01.627 --> 22:05.511
And I think maybe that's a statement you might want to make.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.837
Everything you sell, you would probably be unreservedly willing to buy back.

22:10.217 --> 22:11.459
Yes, of course, of course.

22:11.519 --> 22:14.563
I mean, these things, without a doubt.

22:14.923 --> 22:22.913
So here you have Incarnabula, this one, but I show you another one which is

22:23.180 --> 22:24.902
nearly as fine as this one.

22:25.363 --> 22:29.247
This is the first printed book on architecture ever.

22:29.708 --> 22:34.914
This is Leone Battista Alberchi, the re-edificatoria 1485.

22:34.974 --> 22:43.143
I mean, this is the first book ever written on architecture.

22:43.444 --> 22:48.770
So this is the founding, the cornerstone of architectural books.

22:49.090 --> 22:51.533
But look at the copy.

22:51.749 --> 23:00.718
The binding is a Venetian binding modeled on the Oriental Mudeja bindings.

23:01.318 --> 23:04.221
And the book itself is quite nice.

23:05.743 --> 23:13.270
This is the book, this is the copy of Perfex Murray, the very famous, and Hippolyte Detailleur.

23:13.430 --> 23:17.554
So, I mean, it has also the finest imaginable provenance.

23:19.103 --> 23:22.326
So all the things everybody says that are important, they are important.

23:22.346 --> 23:23.567
Provenance, condition.

23:23.587 --> 23:25.009
This is, this is, this.

23:25.429 --> 23:28.552
The condition is perhaps the most important of all.

23:28.572 --> 23:34.238
Because, I mean, let's take the Schädel chronicle, the Nuremberg Chronicle.

23:34.258 --> 23:34.679
Schädel.

23:34.739 --> 23:35.860
I mean, you can have .

23:36.180 --> 23:36.200
.

23:36.220 --> 23:36.240
.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.201
There are lots of them.

23:37.221 --> 23:38.843
Ah, you can have .

23:38.863 --> 23:38.883
.

23:38.903 --> 23:38.923
.

23:38.943 --> 23:40.665
I at least had 20 of them.

23:41.325 --> 23:48.132
But, uh, um, a normal, say, a normal copy

23:48.449 --> 23:56.719
of the Schädel costs now, well, $30,000 to $35,000 or so, a normal good complete copy.

23:57.080 --> 24:05.610
But a very fine colored copy in very fine condition may cost 20 times that or 30 times that.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.252
It may cost a million.

24:08.414 --> 24:11.758
I mean, the sky is the limit in this case.

24:12.299 --> 24:17.325
And it's always depending on condition and...

24:17.930 --> 24:43.414
and on completeness of course and on provenance and so on because I mean these things are entwined provenance an important provenance can tell us this must have been someone who was able to to afford these things which were as

24:44.288 --> 24:46.471
expensive then, as they are now.

24:46.571 --> 24:50.856
I mean, I show you another book.

24:50.896 --> 25:01.809
This is the first travel book printed, and it's the very, very famous Breidenbach, 1486, also painted, also printed by Schaeffer.

25:02.169 --> 25:04.692
The Breidenbach that travels to the Holy Land.

25:04.912 --> 25:06.154
But look at that copy.

25:06.214 --> 25:12.321
I mean, have you ever seen a copy from 1486 in this condition?

25:14.056 --> 25:17.080
And it has all those folding.

25:17.421 --> 25:19.904
That paper almost looks like it's been bleached.

25:19.984 --> 25:21.065
No, no, not at all.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.328
And look at the condition of it.

25:23.369 --> 25:24.150
Nein, Herr Kortes.

25:24.170 --> 25:24.730
Vielen Dank.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.593
Ja, Ihnen auch.

25:26.613 --> 25:27.154
Look at that.

25:27.414 --> 25:33.302
I mean, this, of course, is the first one.

25:33.382 --> 25:39.330
It's the Travel to the Holy Land.

25:39.350 --> 25:41.393
Or Journey to the Holy Land.

25:42.354 --> 25:43.776
By Bernard Breidenbach.

25:45.967 --> 25:48.069
But look at that copy.

25:48.109 --> 25:50.171
It's unbelievable.

25:50.512 --> 25:54.496
And as it is in its original binding, you see, this is the original binding.

25:55.056 --> 26:00.322
One woodcut, which is always cut into, is not touched.

26:00.702 --> 26:01.503
This one, you know?

26:01.803 --> 26:03.205
What do you mean cut into?

26:03.365 --> 26:07.810
Cut into would say that the binder cut it off here.

26:09.231 --> 26:11.113
But as this is

26:11.600 --> 26:18.968
this has its full margins, you know, it had not to be trimmed.

26:18.988 --> 26:27.078
So, I mean, this is really something that even I do not see every day.

26:27.558 --> 26:37.289
But you have to imagine here every incunable is of that quality and of that kind.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.991
For instance, this one

26:39.967 --> 26:46.313
This is the second book on military things.

26:46.353 --> 26:54.101
But it is illuminated in the workshop of Liberale da Verona.

26:54.121 --> 26:56.343
Look at that.

26:56.764 --> 26:58.966
It's been printed in Verona in 1483.

26:59.186 --> 26:59.606
Look here.

27:02.049 --> 27:08.235
Verona Impressum Domini, 1483, the 13th of February.

27:08.857 --> 27:15.951
And it has then been illuminated in the workshop of Liberale da Verona.

27:16.933 --> 27:18.336
Liberale da Verona.

27:18.416 --> 27:20.380
Liberale da Verona.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.727
He's a very, very important book illuminated.

27:24.263 --> 27:26.945
But he must have... I can find all these people.

27:27.005 --> 27:28.146
Of course.

27:28.186 --> 27:35.513
And by the way, I mean, most of these books that I'm now showing you will be contained in my two catalogs.

27:35.713 --> 27:37.595
And I send you these two catalogs.

27:37.775 --> 27:42.139
So you have all the... I think this will save me a lot of work.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.240
Of course.

27:43.260 --> 27:49.605
I mean, and if you just need whatever it is, just let me know.

27:49.885 --> 27:53.568
I'll send it back by fax or by letter.

27:53.629 --> 27:54.169
Look at that.

27:54.841 --> 27:59.427
And this is a quality of illumination that you don't find normally.

28:00.388 --> 28:08.899
And it is only understandable because it was a manuscript illuminator who did this.

28:09.800 --> 28:17.369
So I'm just showing you two or three... And this is all material that you are preparing to include in your new catalog.

28:17.389 --> 28:23.717
And when that catalog comes out, generally speaking, that will have, you said, 50...

28:24.085 --> 28:29.870
50 unique printed books and another 50 medieval manuscripts.

28:29.890 --> 28:30.071
Okay.

28:31.252 --> 28:35.676
How quickly do you think the contents of that catalog would sell?

28:36.196 --> 28:39.019
Well, it always takes two, three, four years.

28:39.239 --> 28:43.043
But sometimes I sell them within one month or so, you know.

28:43.163 --> 28:53.012
I published a very, very, well, I think a very important catalog on botany and zoology, so natural history.

28:53.785 --> 28:56.048
And I've never done this before, you know.

28:56.068 --> 29:03.638
And it was a catalog like that, with 200 collar plates and so on.

29:03.658 --> 29:07.664
And they were very, very expensive, the books.

29:07.684 --> 29:13.772
But I sold at least the botanical section, I sold out within two months.

29:14.513 --> 29:18.038
And there were books in it, like the Basler,

29:18.608 --> 29:21.552
You know, perhaps that... My God, look at this binding.

29:21.572 --> 29:22.914
I haven't even seen that.

29:22.934 --> 29:24.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:24.196 --> 29:48.092
This is Marius Michel, and this is a very important binding, and it will be in my new catalog, 50 unique books, because of the combination of this binding with the first printing of Goya, four proverbios that got lost in 1828, and

29:48.342 --> 29:50.485
have been printed here for the first time.

29:50.946 --> 29:54.070
And this is one of the five copies you see here.

29:54.832 --> 29:56.133
This is one of five copies.

29:57.856 --> 29:59.278
Oh, God, look at that.

30:00.099 --> 30:09.373
Five copies printed on old Japan paper with four proofs of each of the four proverbios.

30:09.473 --> 30:10.094
You see this?

30:10.254 --> 30:11.396
This is printed on vellum.

30:12.317 --> 30:13.379
Here, on vellum.

30:13.679 --> 30:16.223
And there are only five...

30:16.793 --> 30:17.494
copies of them.

30:18.314 --> 30:25.121
And this is on old Japanese paper, and this is on Watman paper.

30:25.161 --> 30:31.928
This is an etat that is not known to Harris, the great bibliographer.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.650
And this is the known.

30:33.670 --> 30:40.076
This occurs in sales, but these never, because only five of them exist.

30:40.096 --> 30:42.278
So why are there identical prints?

30:42.848 --> 30:43.629
in the same book.

30:43.649 --> 30:44.950
I've never seen such a thing.

30:45.231 --> 30:53.380
Well, this is a sign of the Editions Deluxe, you know, Deluxe Edition.

30:54.221 --> 31:04.693
So they printed the identical plate four times on four different media, different papers.

31:05.233 --> 31:10.399
Or in this case, even on vellum, so on parchment.

31:10.840 --> 31:11.961
So this is parchment,

31:12.430 --> 31:13.751
This is Japanese paper.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.713
This is Watman paper.

31:15.813 --> 31:17.695
And the date on this, this volume?

31:17.715 --> 31:20.218
This is 1877.

31:20.258 --> 31:20.939
1877.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.623
Paris and London.

31:24.643 --> 31:25.103
Yeah.

31:25.544 --> 31:29.788
And you know there are only five copies of this Edition de Luxe.

31:30.288 --> 31:38.657
But this is the only copy, it was Prince Demidov's copy, that has also been bound like this by Marius Michel.

31:39.447 --> 31:43.492
Well, do you get a kick out of it?

31:43.512 --> 31:43.992
Of course.

31:45.734 --> 31:56.927
Well, you know, I mean, you have to combine the kick and a sort of racial, a sort of... Well, you are a professional.

31:56.947 --> 31:57.528
Yeah, of course.

31:57.848 --> 32:01.092
But I still get those kicks, you know.

32:01.112 --> 32:05.657
I mean, seeing a book like that, I mean, this is the finest...

32:06.295 --> 32:07.737
A book on wrestling.

32:08.759 --> 32:12.124
And the first book on wrestling ever published.

32:12.144 --> 32:14.827
So you could do a catalog just on first books, couldn't you?

32:14.848 --> 32:16.390
Oh, of course I mean.

32:16.690 --> 32:20.356
I mean, you've had five or six different first books in the last 15 minutes.

32:20.536 --> 32:21.217
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:21.237 --> 32:27.045
First architecture, first wrestling, first... This is the Editio Princip of Tacitus, you know?

32:27.706 --> 32:28.828
Venice, 1471.

32:29.108 --> 32:35.037
And this has not occurred on the market since 140 years.

32:35.692 --> 32:40.436
I mean, I could make the most marvelous catalog on these things.

32:41.017 --> 32:42.759
But this is also very interesting.

32:42.859 --> 32:49.185
It's the first book on wrestling, and it has 87 woodcuts by Lukas Kranach.

32:49.805 --> 32:52.087
Lukas Kranach.

32:52.368 --> 32:54.970
C-R-A-N-A-C-H.

32:55.050 --> 32:57.312
Lukas Kranach, the great painter.

32:57.753 --> 32:59.494
Lukas Kranach of Leibniz.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.399
And this is the only copy known...

33:05.189 --> 33:10.037
of all those that are still known in the original coloring.

33:10.057 --> 33:12.862
Look, look here.

33:13.022 --> 33:13.483
It's 1539.

33:16.448 --> 33:17.990
All the others are black and white.

33:21.576 --> 33:25.543
So this is really very, very important, this book.

33:27.785 --> 33:29.327
How do you price these things?

33:29.347 --> 33:31.429
I'm not asking for specific numbers.

33:31.449 --> 33:37.457
Well, I mean... How do you determine... Normally I know what I paid for them.

33:37.837 --> 33:43.404
But really it depends on how I cherish them, of course.

33:43.504 --> 33:55.699
I mean, a book that is really close to my heart will be dearer, more expensive than a book that occurs from time to time and...

33:56.101 --> 33:58.684
that you see also in other catalogs, of course.

33:58.985 --> 34:02.790
But here are only books that you never see.

34:03.972 --> 34:06.695
Look at that.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.257
These are just lying around.

34:09.118 --> 34:10.360
Yeah, they're just lying around.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.283
I mean, it's like they're thick on the ground.

34:12.363 --> 34:16.368
These are also very, very interesting things.

34:17.269 --> 34:20.393
Manuscripts there.

34:20.634 --> 34:23.037
This is a manuscript from Parma.

34:24.130 --> 34:28.714
1280, look at the binding.

34:29.855 --> 34:42.447
And this comes from a very famous collection, a collection of André Hachette, the famous French editor.

34:42.467 --> 34:51.775
And here you have inscriptions from the De Rossi family, which was the most important family in Parma.

34:52.160 --> 35:01.654
in that time for two or three hundred years, and there are 20 or 30 miniatures and pages like that.

35:01.674 --> 35:02.996
Do you mind if I go get my camera?

35:03.037 --> 35:09.226
These aren't for publication, but they do help me when I'm writing, if I get a sense of... Do you mind if I shoot a few pictures in here with you?

35:09.446 --> 35:12.311
No, but I think it's better to do it tomorrow.

35:12.331 --> 35:12.611
Okay.

35:12.631 --> 35:16.497
Because, I mean, we just get a sense now...

35:16.797 --> 35:45.268
and tomorrow will be easier and of course I can provide you with something for publication would be wonderful but also I like to have I like visual you have books from the 17th so this is chronologically arranged here you have books from the 17th and the 18th century and there are things that are at least as important as these ones

35:45.822 --> 35:49.727
because most of those books contain the original drawings.

35:50.448 --> 35:53.632
Not only the illustrations, but the original drawings, you know.

35:54.093 --> 35:56.216
I show you one in one.

35:56.616 --> 36:03.906
And this represents... Do you have things in here from the full range of your 20 years as a bookseller?

36:04.807 --> 36:07.010
Well, not quite so.

36:07.050 --> 36:11.796
Of course, most of the more humble things that I...

36:12.164 --> 36:17.090
in the first five or ten years, they are sold.

36:17.150 --> 36:21.716
Of course, most of these come from the last five to ten years.

36:21.756 --> 36:29.846
And I now show you the difference between a fine and a very fine copy, an attention copy.

36:29.866 --> 36:30.827
A attention copy?

36:30.847 --> 36:32.409
Yeah, this is a attention copy, yeah.

36:32.789 --> 36:40.939
You know, Bernard Breslauer published his large catalog, 110,

36:41.594 --> 36:54.345
And when a colleague asked him why he did it so marvelously, so exuberantly, he said that he wanted to out-tenture it.

36:55.486 --> 36:57.367
But he did not succeed.

36:58.148 --> 36:59.689
That's a phrase that I will use.

36:59.709 --> 37:00.850
You can count on that.

37:01.211 --> 37:04.573
Certain things have a resonance when you hear them immediately.

37:04.593 --> 37:05.214
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:05.254 --> 37:08.797
He wanted to out-tenture it because he knew my manuscript.

37:09.277 --> 37:11.179
You see, this is the very famous

37:11.598 --> 37:40.693
book connoisseur on the left on ten it was traded with 20 with 20 um engravings after Fragonard the the the paint after honori Fragonard you see here the famous um avanti edition it out on a way Fragonard so this is a a nice book and this is a good copy but I wouldn't call it a fine copy because uh it is only what

37:40.792 --> 37:42.013
can be expected.

37:42.133 --> 37:44.415
It is in a good Morocco binding.

37:44.455 --> 37:45.976
And the year of it is what?

37:46.017 --> 37:47.158
What's the year of publication?

37:47.178 --> 37:47.698
1795.

37:47.718 --> 37:48.959
1795, yeah.

37:48.999 --> 37:50.260
Two findings.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.822
Yeah, two findings.

37:52.142 --> 37:53.203
Findings are nice.

37:53.303 --> 37:55.004
It's the great Morocco of the time.

37:55.024 --> 37:57.887
So this is quite a nice copy.

37:58.207 --> 38:01.730
But a fine copy is this one, which will also be in my new catalog.

38:02.131 --> 38:04.973
Unique Books.

38:04.993 --> 38:09.617
And this is really now, now be prepared, so to say.

38:09.935 --> 38:14.721
This is Le Veuve de Montgermans copy.

38:15.462 --> 38:21.650
We just make a comparison.

38:21.670 --> 38:22.171
Look here.

38:27.278 --> 38:29.040
Here we have this

38:29.257 --> 38:34.724
not the finished state, but the state before the finished state with the text.

38:34.784 --> 38:44.475
So this is what we call avant la lettre, but with the names of the artists.

38:44.495 --> 38:55.989
Just to show you, this copy is one of the three copies to contain most of the plates in different states in the world.

38:56.389 --> 38:58.572
It has 82 plates

38:59.125 --> 39:20.138
different states of these 20 engravings you see but it does not even have the last state before the last it starts with the third last state here without the names of the of the artist and then with the pure etching

39:22.025 --> 39:26.954
And then with a unique copy of this in contresence.

39:27.775 --> 39:31.802
You see, here he comes from the right, and here he comes from the left.

39:31.822 --> 39:37.291
So this they tried just for... This is just an artist's proof.

39:37.352 --> 39:39.595
It's a practice proof.

39:39.736 --> 39:42.340
Exactly, and it's known only in this copy.

39:42.761 --> 39:46.868
But now comes what makes this copy really unique.

39:47.371 --> 39:48.632
So this is very nice here.

39:48.832 --> 39:50.814
This is very nice.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.295
This is the tensioned copy.

39:52.315 --> 39:58.381
This is the tensioned copy because here you have eight original drawings by Fragonard.

39:58.621 --> 40:00.462
All of them signed.

40:01.323 --> 40:02.224
You see Fragonard.

40:03.265 --> 40:04.746
This is tensioned copy.

40:05.207 --> 40:08.209
Here you have the original.

40:08.730 --> 40:10.151
Just for the sake of my tape.

40:10.271 --> 40:11.332
The territory drawing.

40:11.592 --> 40:13.094
Look here.

40:14.435 --> 40:15.436
And look how tiny it is.

40:15.736 --> 40:15.876
I mean.

40:16.733 --> 40:20.238
This was the original drawing by Fragonard for the engraver.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.322
But only these two have been engraved.

40:23.502 --> 40:25.946
This is not a book, but this is the original art.

40:25.966 --> 40:29.751
This is original art, but I joined these two.

40:30.292 --> 40:38.864
And the combination of the two of them makes this... So you would offer this with this, is that right?

40:39.625 --> 40:40.506
Together.

40:40.526 --> 40:41.247
With this too?

40:41.648 --> 40:42.108
No.

40:43.490 --> 40:45.593
This adds nothing, so to say.

40:46.315 --> 41:00.297
But these two, the combination of these two, this unique copy in itself, together with the eight original drawings of Fragonard, this is the finest thing you can imagine of the 18th century in France.

41:00.317 --> 41:02.921
And they had lots of fine things.

41:02.941 --> 41:05.625
There it is right there.

41:05.645 --> 41:10.973
And you have to imagine that in this new catalog, 50 unique books, there will be 20

41:11.341 --> 41:13.663
books like that, with the original law.

41:13.723 --> 41:15.485
When are you publishing this, when?

41:16.206 --> 41:21.190
In November or December.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.872
I'll remind you, please.

41:23.052 --> 41:25.334
No, no, no, I sent it to you, of course.

41:25.775 --> 41:32.962
I just showed Mr. Bass Baines the difference between a nice and a very fine copy.

41:33.202 --> 41:35.124
And a trenchard copy.

41:37.586 --> 41:39.728
So these are 18th century things

41:39.927 --> 41:43.410
Tomorrow we have a second and a third look on them.

41:43.811 --> 41:46.854
There are very, very fine things there.

41:49.116 --> 41:52.919
Well, for instance, this is also an attention copy, one can say.

41:54.260 --> 41:57.123
This is Solomon Gessner.

41:57.804 --> 41:58.504
Three volumes.

41:58.845 --> 42:00.807
I only show you one.

42:00.827 --> 42:05.211
And 12 copies had... The normal edition is like that.

42:05.371 --> 42:06.452
It's a quarto.

42:07.173 --> 42:09.715
And 12 copies have been struck off.

42:10.167 --> 42:11.628
in large folio.

42:12.469 --> 42:23.599
But this is not only one of the twelve copies in large folio, but it has all the 148 original drawings by Le Dauquier for the engravings.

42:25.541 --> 42:38.453
And so proud was he of this book, and I mean he can be proud, that some of the originals he even colored, I show you one or two of them,

42:39.867 --> 42:44.172
He colored them in watercolor.

42:45.453 --> 42:48.397
Where are they?

42:49.197 --> 42:49.458
Oh, my.

42:49.478 --> 42:50.199
148.

42:50.679 --> 42:52.201
And look how well the watercolors are still.

42:52.261 --> 42:53.803
And how fine they are, yeah.

42:54.584 --> 42:54.724
148.

42:54.744 --> 42:56.145
148.

42:56.506 --> 43:07.478
And so proud, as I said, was he that he also inserted a self-portrait.

43:08.656 --> 43:11.259
exists, of course, in this copy.

43:11.299 --> 43:11.980
Le Barbier.

43:12.481 --> 43:13.482
B-I-E-R.

43:17.687 --> 43:19.049
B-I-E-R.

43:21.712 --> 43:22.893
J-A-J-F.

43:23.895 --> 43:28.400
You see here, auteur de tous les dessins des œuvres de Salomon Gessner, son ami.

43:28.420 --> 43:34.267
And it took him 14 years.

43:34.427 --> 43:35.949
And is that the title there?

43:36.230 --> 43:37.431
Is that the title underneath?

43:37.816 --> 43:40.379
No, this is only... No, I mean into that tissue there.

43:41.501 --> 43:45.606
This is the dedication, the dedication to the conquest of Jean Lys.

43:46.327 --> 43:49.270
So the title of this is Oeuvre, is that said here?

43:49.290 --> 43:55.358
The works of Salomon Gessner, Oeuvre de Salomon Gessner.

43:55.378 --> 44:06.692
There's a good book on French 18th century illustrated books by Gordon Ray, published in the Morgan Library series.

44:07.027 --> 44:14.137
Perhaps I can get you a copy of this, because it's sold out, but perhaps I can get you a copy of this.

44:14.157 --> 44:15.038
I can read it.

44:15.058 --> 44:20.265
So it's Gordon Ray, it's called Le Livre et Libre Stratteur.

44:20.345 --> 44:23.810
I don't have it at the library, I do my research.

44:23.830 --> 44:30.539
And this is bound by the foremost bookbinder of the day, Relié par Beaus et Rien.

44:31.019 --> 44:34.384
So I mean, this is what I like, you know.

44:36.389 --> 44:44.098
Oh, you know that very nice book, Daphnis et Chloé, from 1718.

44:45.480 --> 44:45.940
Look here.

44:47.142 --> 44:52.869
This is a normal but very fine copy of the first edition of 1718.

44:52.909 --> 45:05.063
Les Amours Pastoral with 28 engravings after the tableau of the Réjean.

45:05.414 --> 45:09.760
very nice things, and a very treasured book.

45:11.182 --> 45:11.643
Look here.

45:11.783 --> 45:12.384
It's very nice.

45:12.744 --> 45:16.910
But this is bound by Padelu, and it's one of his finest bindings.

45:19.674 --> 45:24.981
Here is another copy of the same book.

45:25.421 --> 45:25.902
Look here.

45:32.171 --> 45:33.092
Bound like that.

45:34.270 --> 45:46.007
And here's another copy of the engravings, but not folded, you see, on heavy paper, not folded.

45:46.087 --> 45:49.652
Now, is this a scarce book, per se, or are these copies?

45:49.672 --> 45:51.675
No, it's not very scarce.

45:51.695 --> 45:52.837
But it's these copies.

45:53.358 --> 45:59.386
These are all unfindable, because they all... But look at that.

45:59.587 --> 46:02.992
I mean, this is a... They're all unfindable, except that you found them.

46:03.012 --> 46:03.332
Yeah, yeah.

46:03.768 --> 46:22.696
This is a new edition of 1957 with the original engravings, but in new surroundings, in new frames, and with some vignettes by Charles Eisen.

46:22.716 --> 46:26.822
This is in a very fine binding.

46:30.312 --> 46:50.063
And here you have the unique copy of that edition, in which not only all... You have all of the... You have them in two states, one without the frame, and then with the frame, but colored in such a marvelous way.

46:52.247 --> 46:56.353
And it comes from the finest American libraries in this.

46:56.671 --> 47:01.196
private libraries in this century, Robert Ho and Colton Field Bishop.

47:01.677 --> 47:04.080
I mean, these are the—but look at that.

47:05.621 --> 47:07.183
One really has to look at that.

47:09.186 --> 47:12.249
And who is Blotner?

47:12.269 --> 47:12.349
Huh?

47:12.369 --> 47:12.810
Blotner?

47:12.830 --> 47:13.451
I don't know.

47:14.572 --> 47:22.481
But they also call it the very, very fine— Look here.

47:22.501 --> 47:25.705
Ho had a lot of his books bound.

47:25.765 --> 47:26.526
Was that bound?

47:27.046 --> 47:27.567
for Holt.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.089
Robert Holt had a lot of his books.

47:30.169 --> 47:32.031
No, no, this is the original binding.

47:32.051 --> 47:32.672
So he didn't, thank goodness.

47:32.692 --> 47:34.814
Bound by Dahmen in Amsterdam.

47:34.834 --> 47:36.196
Because he did that to a lot of books.

47:36.216 --> 47:37.057
Yeah, yeah, of course.

47:37.117 --> 47:42.983
He had them bound mostly in, in... It was a red, I think, kind of a red.

47:43.083 --> 47:44.685
In France, in France.

47:44.705 --> 47:45.706
Yeah, yeah.

47:45.726 --> 47:51.132
And, uh, I just, just wanted to show you some of the opposite glory that, that I have.

47:51.593 --> 47:53.695
And this has been done for the first

47:54.923 --> 48:19.918
director of the Royal Library, and he didn't want this book that small, so he had every page or every folio re-emerged to a quarter size, inlaid to a quarter size, and so he had a quarto instead of a small octavo.

48:20.438 --> 48:50.277
isn't that I mean and it has been done in the time in 1720 and and this is you show me this is only Daphnis and Chloé and it's only a part of what I have this is the finest thing look look here it's printed on parchment this is not paper this is parchment and it has has all the original drawings

48:51.016 --> 48:53.379
And it has all the original gouache.

48:53.399 --> 48:55.501
Now, who bound that?

48:55.641 --> 48:56.742
Not the artist, of course.

48:56.802 --> 49:00.066
No, no, this was bound by Lorty.

49:00.086 --> 49:11.458
But, I mean, he didn't bind it himself, but was it for himself, or was it for... No, no, no, it was for a very renowned collector named Gancia in 1860.

49:14.121 --> 49:18.846
But the book itself had been assembled by Renoir, the great...

49:19.265 --> 49:26.812
editor and even greater bibliophile in the last years of the 18th century.

49:26.832 --> 49:27.632
Look at that, I mean.

49:27.652 --> 49:28.773
Jeez.

49:28.794 --> 49:34.879
And you see, I mean, these were prepared for a quarter edition.

49:35.520 --> 49:48.411
So this is the only folio, only copy in folio, printed in folio, on vellum, and with all the original drawings and with the original gouaches inlaid to size.

49:49.420 --> 49:53.124
because it was only prepared for a quarter.

49:53.445 --> 49:56.168
Yeah, because you're not afraid to handle these books.

49:56.868 --> 49:58.710
You're not afraid to handle these books.

49:58.791 --> 49:59.311
No, no, no, no.

49:59.331 --> 50:01.634
I mean, I'm quite accustomed to that.

50:01.654 --> 50:08.041
Yeah, but I mean, you're not intimidated by the prospect of bruising them or something like that.

50:08.061 --> 50:08.441
No, no, no.

50:08.622 --> 50:09.382
To the contrary.

50:09.963 --> 50:13.487
I think these, even these finest books of all,

50:13.923 --> 50:16.447
were destined to be read.

50:16.487 --> 50:18.590
And you can read them, you know?

50:18.610 --> 50:24.899
I mean, you can read the medieval manuscripts, and it does not any harm to them.

50:26.301 --> 50:40.743
And you can read these, and they are, after having been read by 20 attentive, by 20 careful readers, of course not readers who throw them away, but after having been read by... Respectful readers.

50:40.823 --> 50:41.844
Respectful readers.

50:42.285 --> 50:43.727
They are exactly...

50:44.078 --> 50:48.225
in the same immaculate state as before.

50:48.825 --> 50:50.288
That's an interesting point, don't you think?

50:50.308 --> 50:51.650
I mean, of course, of course.

50:51.670 --> 50:55.416
You're picking up this book, and you're not being delicate.

50:55.516 --> 50:56.878
No, no, no, not at all.

50:56.898 --> 51:07.555
I'm not suggesting that you're not being cautious either, but I'm just saying that, you know, they want us to treat them

51:08.041 --> 51:11.385
the way they have been treated over the last two or three hundred years.

51:11.405 --> 51:13.108
And books are meant to be read.

51:13.268 --> 51:15.351
Yes, of course.

51:15.771 --> 51:20.898
Or at least to be looked at, to be bruised.

51:20.918 --> 51:31.252
In a general way, when you sell a book, when you place a book of this quality with somebody, is the expectation that the person who buys it is going to enjoy it physically?

51:31.432 --> 51:31.893
Yes.

51:32.093 --> 51:34.156
Or does it become a museum piece?

51:34.256 --> 51:35.898
This is very important for me.

51:35.918 --> 51:36.799
It is very important.

51:37.100 --> 51:40.103
And I have been asked this for many times.

51:40.984 --> 51:46.049
Don't you think that you are too negligent with the books and so on?

51:46.270 --> 51:46.670
For you?

51:47.531 --> 51:52.076
Yeah, because, I mean, these are my books and I know them very well.

51:52.216 --> 52:03.748
And no book in the... 160,000 or 180,000 books that I have handled and still have got worse in my life.

52:21.312 --> 52:42.696
Lots of books really were saved by me, I have to tell that, because, you know, books printed on vellum or books written on vellum, on parchment, if they are kept in overheated rooms, I mean, the parchment begins to wrinkle, no, to wrinkle.

52:43.013 --> 52:46.096
and perhaps even to crack, but to wrinkle.

52:46.116 --> 52:51.421
And if you have paintings on that vellum, of course the color comes off.

52:52.422 --> 53:02.951
So sometimes I bought things only to preserve them from being destroyed.

53:03.192 --> 53:11.299
Now when you place them in the hands of a private individual, you're fairly certain that these people are going to treat them with the same

53:14.570 --> 53:16.733
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure.

53:17.093 --> 53:40.543
They are, I think 99% are even much more careful than I am, but I know these books, and I have handled them dozens and hundreds of times, so I know them very well, and I can handle them quickly and in a very efficient way, and of course private individuals

53:40.844 --> 53:42.285
They cherish them.

53:42.446 --> 53:43.267
They love them.

53:43.607 --> 53:48.192
And, of course, they don't have so many as I have.

53:48.212 --> 53:55.219
The people that you, who are your clients, are they a vanishing breed of collector, do you think?

53:55.239 --> 54:07.071
Or is this still very much, you know, as we approach the next millennium, is the person who... This is, of course, an essential question.

54:07.091 --> 54:08.893
And I think that they will never vanish.

54:09.397 --> 54:14.523
I think they will never vanish because, you know... The people, you mean.

54:14.763 --> 54:17.286
The people, the collecting people will never vanish.

54:17.306 --> 54:18.387
At this level, too.

54:18.928 --> 54:21.991
Especially at this level.

54:22.011 --> 54:36.467
Because more and more, even people collecting art recognize that these kinds of books, these kinds of books, that they are an art inventor.

54:39.316 --> 54:49.852
You know, the difference between books that just are read and then thrown away and books from the 10th, the 11th until the 20th century.

54:49.872 --> 54:54.299
I mean, here you have Leger or Chagall or whatever, Picasso.

54:56.041 --> 54:58.445
This difference gets wider and wider.

54:59.126 --> 55:07.939
And the books that deserve to be called art, pieces of art, works of art, they will get...

55:08.425 --> 55:23.019
more valuable, and there will always be more people who really like to collect and like to know more about these goods.

55:24.380 --> 55:37.673
And as I'm only dealing with, say, a minimal fraction of all those that can be interested, I mean, only with 10 or 20 in the world,

55:38.446 --> 55:40.990
No, perhaps 30 in the world.

55:41.010 --> 55:41.430
People?

55:41.550 --> 55:45.876
These people, these 30 are… Did you say that's your basic client base in about 30 people?

55:45.896 --> 55:46.217
Yeah, yeah.

55:46.237 --> 55:46.457
Really?

55:46.638 --> 55:48.981
And these 30 people will always exist, you know.

55:49.441 --> 55:52.105
If one dies, there will be another, or two others.

55:53.307 --> 56:04.583
And I do not do much for, you know, publicity or something.

56:04.603 --> 56:05.144
You don't need it.

56:05.364 --> 56:06.225
No.

56:07.420 --> 56:36.111
those who see my catalogs they know that they can rely on me and that it is worth buying books with me and this is the only thing that counts well just to to finish that tour and then we go to the restaurant these are books from the botanical and the zoological sections you see those nine red books there this is the finest book on birds

56:36.496 --> 56:43.423
ever published in the 18th century, Buffon, the birds of Buffon.

56:43.544 --> 56:53.935
And this is the copy of the Tsar, Alexander III, and his wife, Maria Parlovna, illuminated in a very special way.

56:55.036 --> 57:04.346
You have to imagine that of this large folio edition of Buffon, only about 15 to 20 copies have been struck off.

57:04.807 --> 57:06.148
And there you have two of them.

57:07.225 --> 57:13.451
The ones over there that are copied is also one of the 20.

57:13.831 --> 57:18.095
This contains 14 original watercolors.

57:18.115 --> 57:22.039
And there you have fine atlases and so on.

57:22.299 --> 57:25.062
There are 16 volumes of original watercolors.

57:25.082 --> 57:33.991
4,000 original watercolors of botanical, of flowers.

57:34.011 --> 57:34.431
I wonder.

57:34.799 --> 57:36.001
No, no, no.

57:36.162 --> 57:37.604
Because that's the kind of book he would have had.

57:37.745 --> 57:38.686
Yeah, of course, of course.

57:38.706 --> 57:41.271
If he had known, he would have bought this.

57:41.291 --> 57:41.973
Look at that.

57:41.993 --> 57:45.219
I mean, there are 4,000 watercolors.

57:45.239 --> 57:45.540
Not 20.

57:45.600 --> 57:49.988
Watercolors?

57:50.008 --> 57:51.872
No, watercolors.

57:51.912 --> 57:53.495
4,000.

57:53.515 --> 57:55.238
These 16...

57:55.336 --> 57:58.339
In terms of rarity, does this stack up with the Audubon?

57:59.681 --> 58:06.769
Well, this is much rarer, because, I mean, the Audubon, this exists in 20 or 25 or 30 copies, and this is unique.

58:07.009 --> 58:12.936
I mean, this is per definition, unique, because it has never been printed, you know.

58:12.956 --> 58:17.261
It's the original watercolor, 4,000 of them.

58:18.723 --> 58:25.090
And his name again, I should write that down.

58:25.897 --> 58:27.579
H-A-P-P-E.

58:30.522 --> 58:31.863
H-A-P-P-E.

58:32.023 --> 58:34.286
Double P-E.

58:34.506 --> 58:35.847
And Summa Botanica.

58:36.188 --> 58:39.371
Summa Botanica.

58:39.391 --> 58:43.075
Here's the finest copy of Piranesi sold in this century.

58:43.095 --> 58:44.036
Look at how tall they are.

58:44.056 --> 58:46.598
Look here, here, here, and here.

58:47.039 --> 58:48.700
There's about four feet.

58:48.720 --> 58:53.305
It's like the Odebon, the elephant, double elephant folio.

58:53.774 --> 59:00.602
And these are 27 volumes with 1,256 engravings of the finest quality you can imagine.

59:02.384 --> 59:03.825
Do you ever sell any American books?

59:04.106 --> 59:05.067
Probably not.

59:05.127 --> 59:08.211
Well, I just, well, I mean, this is not an American book.

59:08.231 --> 59:17.661
I just sold the Maximilian Witt zu Neu Witt, the very famous, with the Bodmer lithographs, you know, a very fine copy.

59:18.062 --> 59:19.143
And of course I have some.

59:19.503 --> 59:22.667
But, I mean, there are so many dealers who are

59:23.018 --> 59:30.608
exclusively dealing in Americana that I should not intrude, so to say.

59:31.048 --> 59:35.614
But of all the other things, I think I have the finest copy.

59:35.634 --> 59:41.922
This is the finest copy of Watteau, the whole work of Watteau in four volumes.

59:43.865 --> 59:45.467
I've never been in a room like this.

59:45.487 --> 59:46.969
No, no, no, and you never will.

59:47.610 --> 59:51.675
Look here, this is the gold, the birth of Australia, birth of Asia.

59:52.229 --> 59:53.050
What a copy.

59:54.892 --> 59:59.216
So this is at least an English book.

59:59.236 --> 59:59.957
Look here.

59:59.977 --> 01:00:01.839
Oh, my God, look at those.

01:00:01.879 --> 01:00:09.767
580 colored lithographs, hand-colored lithographs.

01:00:10.248 --> 01:00:11.109
I love that.

01:00:11.249 --> 01:00:13.992
And, yeah, and the copy is... Oh, my God.

01:00:15.914 --> 01:00:17.916
Brilliant.

01:00:18.149 --> 01:00:24.237
And it has 560 or 580 of the Kingfisher.

01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:27.862
By the way, we have Kingfisher's here.

01:00:27.882 --> 01:00:29.724
We have those birds here.

01:00:33.149 --> 01:00:33.950
Magnificent.

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:35.432
And the copy is mint.

01:00:37.054 --> 01:00:39.617
Original binding, all seven volumes of the

01:00:50.617 --> 01:00:53.083
And then I buy it, or try to buy it.

01:00:55.268 --> 01:01:03.008
I always like to think I know, and I never do, how a chapter or how something starts and how it ends.

01:01:03.649 --> 01:01:07.258
I don't know yet, but right off the bat I'm thinking I could

01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:12.984
I've never been in a room like this in my life, and your answer is, hey, you never will.

01:01:13.004 --> 01:01:14.325
You never will again.

01:01:14.726 --> 01:01:25.736
You know, I get visits from my colleagues and so on, and they write me, may I visit you?

01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:31.361
I just received a card from Simon Finch, whom perhaps you know.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:35.305
He's one of the leading booksellers in London, and he said,

01:01:35.791 --> 01:01:42.741
Last time I thought about it, and it's very curious that I've never visited the most important bookseller of my time.

01:01:43.502 --> 01:01:58.643
And I said, well, this is very flattering, but come and see some of my books, and then perhaps you will even discover that you were right.
