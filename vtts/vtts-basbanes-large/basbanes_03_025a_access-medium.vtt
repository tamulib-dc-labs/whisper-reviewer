WEBVTT

00:04.840 --> 00:07.525
Excuse me.

00:07.585 --> 00:09.568
Why don't you pronounce your name for me, Nancy?

00:11.070 --> 00:11.391
It's on.

00:11.772 --> 00:14.656
Pronounce, how you pronounce your name?

00:14.677 --> 00:15.298
Oh, Ovedovitz.

00:15.318 --> 00:15.999
Ovedovitz.

00:16.019 --> 00:17.481
Okay, just the way it reads.

00:17.501 --> 00:18.763
Yeah, just the way it reads.

00:18.924 --> 00:22.910
And you briefly, your job here at Yale?

00:23.431 --> 00:24.974
I'm the design manager here now.

00:25.034 --> 00:28.059
I've been here for 25 years, a little more than that.

00:29.441 --> 00:30.443
My job has changed.

00:30.963 --> 00:33.025
enormously since I've been here.

00:33.165 --> 00:34.066
Well, my title has, too.

00:34.106 --> 00:43.015
I started out as a designer, and then got promoted to senior designer, and then became a design manager about ten years ago.

00:43.536 --> 00:47.660
And so this is 2005, so you came here about 1980, I guess.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.681
Was it 25?

00:48.721 --> 00:48.981
Yes.

00:50.503 --> 00:51.103
February, yeah.

00:51.123 --> 00:51.864
And you came from?

00:52.965 --> 00:56.469
I came from, I was working for McGraw-Hill in New York.

00:56.549 --> 01:00.953
I was commuting to New York, working for the Gregg division, which is like

01:01.692 --> 01:04.416
junior college-level textbooks.

01:06.518 --> 01:15.850
So I read in a little description of your duties that you do about 30 or so books a year as a designer.

01:16.391 --> 01:17.012
As a designer.

01:17.032 --> 01:23.761
Yes, although that's getting to be fewer and fewer as I do more administrative stuff and hire freelancers.

01:27.085 --> 01:30.349
But I wouldn't like to not do that at all, because that's my favorite part.

01:30.717 --> 01:33.059
How important is design to a university, Chris?

01:35.321 --> 01:38.884
Well, these days, pretty critical, actually.

01:39.185 --> 01:43.288
I think back when we were... My day.

01:44.149 --> 01:48.253
The first use of a pen, I dropped it on the floor.

01:48.273 --> 01:48.773
Come over here.

01:52.096 --> 01:52.837
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

01:53.017 --> 01:59.543
I think back when I first started here and we were doing all scholarly books, almost all scholarly books,

02:00.215 --> 02:04.640
it was probably much less important.

02:05.021 --> 02:16.014
Obviously, it was necessary just for making things readable, but as for having to compete in the marketplace, that just didn't happen.

02:17.135 --> 02:25.305
There was always an audience for books in a library for our scholarly books.

02:25.465 --> 02:29.850
Most of our books had a minimum sale of

02:30.539 --> 02:33.404
2,500 or 3,000 copies just to libraries.

02:34.286 --> 02:37.692
So we didn't have to worry about what the book jackets looked like.

02:37.852 --> 02:39.255
Or if there were jackets at all.

02:39.455 --> 02:40.337
Exactly.

02:42.420 --> 02:48.331
When I first came here, we did a lot of one-color jackets, and we were lucky to get two colors.

02:48.672 --> 02:54.943
Four colors was like once every few years we would do a four-color book jacket.

02:55.835 --> 03:01.099
I haven't done a one-color jacket in a long time.

03:02.441 --> 03:04.542
And we do very few, even two-color jackets.

03:04.602 --> 03:05.743
Most of them are three or four.

03:06.044 --> 03:07.185
And this is expensive?

03:07.565 --> 03:07.885
Oh, yes.

03:08.406 --> 03:11.008
Oh, yes, much more expensive.

03:11.028 --> 03:25.200
And at what point would you say there was an attitude, either awareness or change, that you had to compete, I guess, that you actually

03:26.362 --> 03:29.104
It seemed like it evolved over years.

03:34.690 --> 03:42.877
Somewhere in there, there was a decision that we had to publish more trade books, as they're called.

03:43.678 --> 03:50.124
I don't know that I can even pinpoint the time.

03:50.144 --> 03:52.706
Do you remember when you were actually mindful?

03:53.366 --> 03:56.149
Talk to me a little bit about some of the books that you recall.

03:56.872 --> 04:06.424
really making this transformation where you really were going out to compete in the trade world.

04:07.406 --> 04:18.981
Maybe if you could just talk about some of the books that come to mind as some of the ones you enjoyed working most with and your thoughts on how they really do influence the marketplace.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.629
We're entering a conversation.

04:25.670 --> 04:26.811
I'm looking for ways to

04:27.179 --> 04:30.224
they really characterize the press, because it is so successful.

04:30.725 --> 04:35.854
It operates in the black, which to me is really fantastic, you know.

04:35.874 --> 04:39.360
And there have to be many elements at work here.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.988
It's got a lot of very hard-working people here, mostly.

04:44.008 --> 04:47.414
I don't know.

04:47.434 --> 04:52.242
My memory is not what it used to be.

04:52.998 --> 04:58.524
The approach that you take when you were at McGraw-Hill, obviously, were you working with multi-colored jackets, right?

04:58.805 --> 04:59.746
Yes, yes.

05:01.548 --> 05:08.776
Well, you know, I was doing, we did the interiors as well as the jackets, and we have multi-colors on the insides of the books.

05:08.796 --> 05:09.056
Really?

05:09.396 --> 05:19.748
Yeah, and I sort of felt, you know, it was aimed at, like, junior college-level students, and I sort of felt like it was

05:20.302 --> 05:21.683
kind of patronizing to the students.

05:21.703 --> 05:23.265
No, what was the name between the college students?

05:23.285 --> 05:26.008
The books, the book designs, yeah.

05:26.028 --> 05:27.109
Really?

05:27.129 --> 05:27.229
Yeah.

05:27.249 --> 05:38.621
Um, and I... Can you describe, if you can, what... Oh, you know, they wanted, like, a lot of color in the book, and, like, little doodads all over the pages, and they... University Press books, they don't remember.

05:38.641 --> 05:40.303
No, no, McGraw-Hill books.

05:40.323 --> 05:48.351
And, you know, I used to think of it as sort of a McDonaldland kind of design, and, um, you know, try to make things, like, ultra-accessible to, um,

05:48.635 --> 05:52.220
college students, you know, and I actually didn't like it very much.

05:53.101 --> 06:01.673
So I was really happy when I came here and I could, you know, design serious books for people who would just read them and didn't have to be enticed with little doodads.

06:06.379 --> 06:12.668
We still don't do a lot of little doodads here, but the jackets certainly have changed a lot.

06:14.268 --> 06:20.956
It's hard for me, you know, it's hard for me to pinpoint a time, because it was such a gradual change, it seemed.

06:21.597 --> 06:25.222
I'd probably have to look at the old catalogs to give you titles.

06:28.125 --> 06:41.001
But was there a point, it must have been throughout the press, where there was a decision, or there was a movement made towards just, you can't do business in the traditional... No, we weren't making any money.

06:41.318 --> 06:46.465
I mean, even in, I remember in like 1982, I think it was somewhere around there.

06:46.485 --> 06:47.867
I don't know why that sticks in my head.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.173
We had a real financial crisis here.

06:53.294 --> 06:58.101
And, you know, to the point of, you know, memos about not using too many paper clips and things like that.

06:58.161 --> 07:08.895
And maybe it was after that that there was more, you know, we were looking more towards

07:09.432 --> 07:12.295
having some books that could compete out there in the marketplace.

07:12.696 --> 07:22.428
It's almost, and of course you probably can't speak to this, but it's almost historically accepted that university presses aren't expected to make any money.

07:22.748 --> 07:24.630
No, except us.

07:25.171 --> 07:33.141
Well, I remember at that point things were very bad and I know the director had asked the university to help us out and they'd said no.

07:33.161 --> 07:39.388
And I think at that point maybe that was when we decided, you know, there was a decision here that we had a

07:40.330 --> 07:46.655
We had a look outside of the scholarly marketplace to remain alive.

07:47.136 --> 07:57.164
So what kind of an attitude do you bring to a book, a manuscript, to perk it up, to make it a... To make it appeal to our general audience?

07:57.184 --> 07:57.405
Yeah, yeah.

07:57.765 --> 08:02.089
And do you subscribe to the suggestion that a cover does entice?

08:02.189 --> 08:03.590
Yes, of course.

08:06.212 --> 08:09.595
We have a sort of chronic problem with editors who want the...

08:09.997 --> 08:15.886
and authors themselves, who want the jacket to sort of very precisely reflect what's inside the book.

08:15.907 --> 08:22.898
And honestly, it's really hard to do, and it's not necessarily sort of graphically interesting.

08:23.399 --> 08:31.832
My gut feeling is that a book jacket that intrigues somebody and makes them pick it up, that book jacket's done its job.

08:32.874 --> 08:34.857
And it doesn't have to be like an exact...

08:35.208 --> 08:38.152
representation of every little thing that's in the book.

08:38.172 --> 08:39.815
How do you do that graphically anyway?

08:40.235 --> 08:48.267
I mean, I wonder how you actually do that, the cover, to really summarize, encapsulate the textual content of the book.

08:48.287 --> 08:48.487
You can't.

08:48.507 --> 08:49.288
Obviously, you can't.

08:49.348 --> 08:51.391
And if you could, it would be a mess.

08:51.411 --> 08:55.197
There would be way too much information, you know, for a book jacket to carry.

08:55.918 --> 09:02.908
So, yeah, so we just try to make it somewhat representative and attractive.

09:02.928 --> 09:03.629
And attractive.

09:03.669 --> 09:04.270
And inviting.

09:04.722 --> 09:05.263
Exactly.

09:05.903 --> 09:08.186
And when you say pick it up, you mean pick it up in a bookstore?

09:08.366 --> 09:09.007
Yes.

09:09.027 --> 09:09.247
Oh, yeah.

09:09.267 --> 09:15.193
Not necessarily pick it up in a library, because when somebody gets to it at the library point, they're going to see the book.

09:16.114 --> 09:22.802
So it's really an invitation to... Even the spine in the library would, an interesting spine would help it in the library, though, I think.

09:22.822 --> 09:24.063
You know.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.466
Just clear and attractive.

09:26.846 --> 09:27.987
Yeah.

09:28.007 --> 09:31.371
So are there any ones in particular that...

09:32.347 --> 09:35.232
Now, you say you do 20 or 30 a year yourself.

09:35.252 --> 09:38.477
There are about 300 books or so that Yale is publishing each year.

09:38.497 --> 09:38.958
Is that right?

09:39.359 --> 09:40.100
I think 200.

09:40.300 --> 09:40.641
Is it 200?

09:40.741 --> 09:42.303
I think so, yeah.

09:43.245 --> 09:45.168
And so you farm out a lot of this work?

09:45.469 --> 09:45.909
Some of it.

09:46.250 --> 09:46.651
Some of it.

09:47.692 --> 09:48.954
Not a lot.

09:49.014 --> 09:50.256
Certainly not the majority of it.

09:50.277 --> 09:51.559
This department does.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.403
Now, do you expect that the designers are going to read the whole book?

09:54.924 --> 09:55.445
Never.

09:56.306 --> 09:56.667
Never.

09:57.136 --> 10:01.161
Most of our books are pretty dense.

10:01.462 --> 10:04.125
We do read a few here and there, but most of them are pretty dense.

10:05.007 --> 10:09.873
And so we get a synopsis from the editor and an idea of who the audience is.

10:11.696 --> 10:23.211
Sometimes the authors have ideas about what their jackets should look like, and they're not usually very good at designing them themselves, but sometimes they have good ideas.

10:23.545 --> 10:27.169
Well, my first book, Gentle Madness, which was huge.

10:27.329 --> 10:28.530
It's a four-pound book.

10:28.550 --> 10:29.311
Holt published it.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.392
Wow.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.296
And, you know, I'll not see that again.

10:33.316 --> 10:36.779
I mean, the whole industry has changed where they don't want big books anymore.

10:36.799 --> 10:37.280
When was that?

10:37.360 --> 10:37.640
Yeah.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.361
It was ten years ago.

10:38.421 --> 10:39.182
It was number five.

10:39.202 --> 10:39.622
Yeah.

10:39.642 --> 10:41.004
But it's still in print.

10:42.425 --> 10:50.775
But when I submitted the typescript, I had a specific idea of what I'd spent ten years on this book.

10:50.795 --> 10:51.075
Yes.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.456
What the cover should be.

10:52.917 --> 10:53.097
Uh-huh.

10:53.296 --> 11:00.045
I had Xeroxed an engraving of Dura's Book Fool.

11:00.065 --> 11:00.806
It's from 1493.

11:00.886 --> 11:04.090
It's from the Ship of Fools.

11:04.170 --> 11:04.951
That's now in chief.

11:04.971 --> 11:07.955
And there's this crazy guy, because the book is about bibliomania.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.618
And I just Xeroxed it and put it on top of the typescript.

11:11.459 --> 11:11.599
Uh-huh.

11:11.619 --> 11:11.759
Uh-huh.

11:11.779 --> 11:15.825
And lo and behold, that became, you know, if you want to see it, you can Google it.

11:16.005 --> 11:17.086
Yeah, I'd love to see it.

11:17.106 --> 11:18.288
It is fabulous.

11:18.308 --> 11:21.552
There's wild kinds of prizes and stuff.

11:21.572 --> 11:22.493
And you just

11:23.097 --> 11:25.499
Go to my website, nicholasbazbaines.com.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.400
Do you want to see?

11:26.420 --> 11:32.886
In fact, the new one is up there.

11:33.507 --> 11:36.830
And then actually, if you look at the first, there were two signatures of photos.

11:37.430 --> 11:43.576
And the very first sig, I had the actual, I told them how I have decided.

11:43.636 --> 11:47.259
For the photos that I use, I pretty much tell them what I want.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.441
They've designed it, of course.

11:49.521 --> 11:51.383
And this new book is coming out.

11:52.443 --> 11:54.466
I virtually designed it for them.

11:54.666 --> 11:55.448
I took the pictures.

11:55.568 --> 11:57.110
I shot all my own pictures.

11:58.532 --> 12:05.764
But, you know, I suppose if you have an idea of what you want as an author, it's not a bad idea to suggest it.

12:05.844 --> 12:06.164
No, no.

12:06.304 --> 12:10.571
But it never surprises me to see, especially this new jacket here, every book it's read.

12:10.611 --> 12:13.776
I had no clue what they were doing.

12:14.380 --> 12:18.524
I mean, I like it, but it doesn't tell you what the book's about in any way.

12:18.584 --> 12:19.165
It's just pretty.

12:19.205 --> 12:19.686
It's different.

12:19.706 --> 12:24.471
It's got a little funny thing with the type, you know, design.

12:24.791 --> 12:25.892
Yeah, yeah.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.114
It's an interesting angle.

12:27.594 --> 12:27.894
Yeah.

12:28.195 --> 12:31.819
So how important is type, you know, I mean, the selection of types?

12:31.839 --> 12:32.800
Oh, I think it's critical.

12:33.180 --> 12:42.430
I think it's, I don't think, you know, obviously your audience is not going to know exactly what typeface you're using or anything, but I think they get a,

12:42.697 --> 12:48.162
There's sort of an underlying message about what year this book is being published.

12:48.622 --> 12:51.865
And while that, you know, might not sound important, I think it is.

12:51.885 --> 12:58.551
I think people, you know, if it's a new book, people want to know it's a new book, and it's, you know, and it's contemporary, and this is not old news.

13:01.693 --> 13:07.218
And it can communicate a lot of different things, you know, a lot of different... I'm sorry.

13:08.079 --> 13:11.742
For this, I'll talk about myself, but my new book, for the first time, I...

13:11.890 --> 13:13.492
I wanted to have a note on the type.

13:13.712 --> 13:14.673
What's the type?

13:14.773 --> 13:15.554
Oh, on the text.

13:15.574 --> 13:16.876
On the type that we used.

13:17.176 --> 13:18.638
Because we used the same type.

13:18.738 --> 13:25.445
And they said the reason that they chose Harvester is the same type for this book as they used for the last one, because everybody thought it was wonderful.

13:25.785 --> 13:29.369
And I said, well, it's wonderful, so why don't we say what it is, if everybody likes it so much.

13:29.389 --> 13:30.351
And it took, like, two weeks.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.254
And there must have been, they were on vacation.

13:33.594 --> 13:35.436
For me to find out, actually, it was Fournier.

13:35.696 --> 13:37.078
Fournier, yeah.

13:37.098 --> 13:37.999
Fournier.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.967
And then I wrote a little thing on it.

13:40.227 --> 13:40.708
Oh, you did?

13:40.828 --> 13:41.108
I did.

13:41.248 --> 13:42.249
Oh, how nice.

13:42.269 --> 13:42.790
Yeah, I did.

13:42.910 --> 13:48.776
And then I ran it by Terry Ballinger at the Book Arts Press, I don't know if you know him, at the University of Virginia.

13:49.296 --> 13:54.342
He used to run it at Columbia before they closed the library school, and then he went down at UVA.

13:54.362 --> 13:55.983
He was very knowledgeable on this stuff.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.765
And so I ran it by him.

13:58.326 --> 13:59.767
But I wrote the note on the type.

14:00.628 --> 14:03.431
And just, you know, one of these transitional types, early types.

14:03.511 --> 14:04.232
It's economical.

14:04.272 --> 14:05.353
It's clean.

14:05.536 --> 14:06.817
Yes.

14:06.837 --> 14:07.618
People like to know.

14:07.899 --> 14:08.699
I like to know that.

14:08.719 --> 14:09.741
Yes, I do, too.

14:09.801 --> 14:11.903
It's like if you're writing a book about books and book culture.

14:11.943 --> 14:12.844
Yes.

14:12.864 --> 14:15.187
It would seem to me that... Yes, I'd love to do that.

14:15.207 --> 14:25.017
We were trying to do that in our texts for a while, but it's just, we use a lot of fonts, and it's kind of hard to keep up with, and just making extra work for the editors.

14:25.158 --> 14:27.120
Are they all digital types now?

14:27.140 --> 14:29.282
These days, these days they are.

14:29.414 --> 14:35.483
But it's a lot of, you know, most old fonts have been turned into digital fonts.

14:35.823 --> 14:37.626
Some of them even got improved.

14:39.168 --> 14:43.234
Now, when you first started in 1980, were you, had they made a conversion?

14:43.274 --> 14:43.955
No, no, no.

14:43.975 --> 14:46.739
So you're still working with traditional fonts?

14:46.879 --> 14:50.384
We were still using, some places were still setting our books in hot metal.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.065
Wow.

14:51.185 --> 14:54.650
You know, books with math in them, particularly.

14:54.670 --> 14:59.016
And then for a little while...

14:59.705 --> 15:02.408
Books were getting set by IBM Selectric.

15:03.109 --> 15:04.031
No kidding?

15:04.511 --> 15:05.372
In some places.

15:06.093 --> 15:06.614
Seriously?

15:06.634 --> 15:15.205
Yeah, and I had type books from all these different type houses, and each house had only, like, you know, five fonts.

15:15.225 --> 15:16.406
It was very limited.

15:16.787 --> 15:23.455
And some places, for some reason, could only set, like, Times Roman with Universe.

15:23.856 --> 15:28.462
For instance, Universe is a sans serif that you would use for, like, titles and stuff.

15:28.482 --> 15:28.682
Um...

15:28.949 --> 15:31.453
You know, they could only combine them in a couple of ways.

15:33.496 --> 15:42.610
Yeah, we didn't start using... God, I guess about the time we got computers here, you know, by then pretty much our typesetters were using.

15:43.351 --> 15:45.434
And this is all stuff that's done here in this building?

15:46.236 --> 15:47.117
No, none.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.760
We don't typeset any of our texts.

15:48.780 --> 15:49.461
Nothing?

15:49.481 --> 15:49.661
No.

15:49.701 --> 15:50.122
That's all.

15:50.202 --> 15:51.744
That's all.

15:51.965 --> 15:55.530
We use our computers to design the inside of the texts, and we, you know, we send...

15:56.084 --> 15:59.467
specifications and samples to the compositors.

16:00.048 --> 16:05.312
This 1945 book, I get review books, too, so I do review them.

16:05.592 --> 16:05.893
Oh.

16:05.913 --> 16:12.379
And I thought that was just a really dramatically successful jacket, in fact.

16:12.539 --> 16:13.259
Oh, thank you.

16:13.460 --> 16:14.641
Oh, thank you.

16:15.481 --> 16:17.323
And again, what is the picture?

16:17.343 --> 16:20.706
It's a photograph that's trying to express a whole year.

16:21.166 --> 16:22.468
Right, very right.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.230
So how did you pick the photo?

16:25.666 --> 16:31.514
That book was published in England, and they had a book jacket on it.

16:31.614 --> 16:34.158
It had a different title.

16:34.178 --> 16:36.101
And they had a book jacket on it with that photograph.

16:36.321 --> 16:37.462
Oh, so they used the same picture.

16:37.483 --> 16:39.445
And so we liked it, so we bought it, too.

16:39.485 --> 16:42.710
And what was the original title?

16:42.750 --> 16:43.411
We can find out.

16:43.511 --> 16:44.552
It was something long.

16:45.113 --> 16:45.614
Don't look it up.

16:45.634 --> 16:47.657
It was something long, you know.

16:49.599 --> 16:54.026
But you still found that using the same art expressed the idea, even though the title had changed.

16:54.046 --> 16:54.306
Yeah.

16:54.775 --> 16:58.059
Is there any way to assess the success?

17:00.002 --> 17:00.483
Not really.

17:03.327 --> 17:14.342
We do what we can, but obviously they look at sales, but people have to be interested in the subject as well as the jacket to buy the book.

17:15.724 --> 17:21.812
We get feedback from our sales reps and from the buyers who they see.

17:23.214 --> 17:23.314
Yeah.

17:23.918 --> 17:28.083
Periodically, and this is pretty recent that we're getting it very regularly.

17:30.546 --> 17:38.035
The in-house salespeople are sort of forwarding us all the assessments from the outside salespeople.

17:38.256 --> 17:44.844
Do you think that placement in bookstores is relative to how attractive the book is?

17:44.864 --> 17:46.366
Well, yes, absolutely.

17:47.066 --> 17:52.373
I know...

17:52.673 --> 17:55.556
just up the street, you know, at the Yale bookstore.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.699
They, you know, they always have a display.

17:57.739 --> 18:04.226
They put, like, three copies, I think, of the books that they want to display all around the outside of the windows.

18:04.286 --> 18:08.751
And we're thrilled when we get a book in there.

18:10.093 --> 18:10.193
Yeah.

18:10.213 --> 18:13.617
Well, again, going back to my first book, when I can't, I was nobody.

18:13.697 --> 18:16.120
I mean, I didn't know who the head I was.

18:16.140 --> 18:22.647
And my mother, who's now in her 80s, when she was walking down in New York, Fifth Avenue, or wherever.

18:23.082 --> 18:25.345
It was always bookstores.

18:25.385 --> 18:27.727
They had made a poster of my book.

18:27.827 --> 18:27.968
Wow.

18:28.028 --> 18:30.451
And it was in the window just because they loved it.

18:30.471 --> 18:35.717
And she went in and she said, you must give me that poster.

18:35.737 --> 18:39.421
I said, man, what are you talking about?

18:39.441 --> 18:39.982
She said, that's my poster.

18:40.002 --> 18:40.983
I said, what are you talking about?

18:41.003 --> 18:41.844
That's so funny.

18:41.864 --> 18:44.166
Leave that poster exactly where it is.

18:44.246 --> 18:45.968
You're not going to fool around with that.

18:46.930 --> 18:49.933
You know, I mean, you get something like that.

18:50.707 --> 18:53.470
It's a fabulous promotion for your book.

18:53.490 --> 19:01.518
I mean, I actually thank the woman who, in my acknowledgements, has such a striking design.

19:01.538 --> 19:02.799
Oh, that's nice, yes.

19:02.819 --> 19:06.063
I just believe that she just hit a home run on it, you know.

19:06.203 --> 19:08.605
And then she did the Gently Mad one, too.

19:08.645 --> 19:10.888
I did two books with Holden, the one you're looking at.

19:10.908 --> 19:12.409
Uh-huh.

19:12.429 --> 19:14.011
That one you're looking at right there.

19:14.031 --> 19:14.852
Yes, it's right.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.074
That's Raquel Jamarillo, I guess is her name.

19:17.394 --> 19:18.315
Oh, I know her name.

19:18.495 --> 19:19.016
Yeah.

19:19.396 --> 19:20.157
She's wonderful.

19:20.727 --> 19:26.112
I think she's still at Holt, but I haven't done a couple books.

19:26.172 --> 19:28.954
You know, I look at designers' names and the book jackets.

19:28.974 --> 19:29.775
She won an award.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.756
She's won lots of awards, yeah.

19:31.796 --> 19:49.491
My book was just one of those fabulous things where the art and the design... It's interesting to me that you have this attitude on the university press level, and I wonder how many other university presses are as savvy as this one is.

19:49.811 --> 19:50.532
Well, some of them.

19:50.883 --> 19:51.404
Some of them.

19:51.464 --> 19:59.733
I mean, you know, there's the Association of American University Presses, you know, the AAUP.

19:59.753 --> 20:06.161
Every year there's a yearly meeting, and there's a jacket design, and it is fiercely competitive.

20:07.122 --> 20:19.696
In fact, we find it easier to get our work into Print Magazine, which is a national publication of, like, you know, and people in all walks of design send stuff.

20:19.956 --> 20:20.417
We find it

20:20.752 --> 20:23.955
easier to get our work into there than into the AAUP book show.

20:24.416 --> 20:24.896
No kidding.

20:24.916 --> 20:25.417
No kidding.

20:25.997 --> 20:26.678
That's amazing.

20:28.180 --> 20:33.005
Well, the AAUP is also judged almost always just by designers.

20:33.465 --> 20:45.317
And designers who are really into, you know, fine typography and careful design work, you know, a university press is not a bad place for them to work.

20:45.798 --> 20:45.898
Yeah.

20:46.638 --> 20:50.882
The pressures aren't the same as they are in a trade publishing house.

20:52.063 --> 20:58.970
So when you have a typescript comes to you and it's ready, at what point do you start doing the jacket?

20:58.990 --> 21:01.333
I mean, after the thing is edited?

21:01.353 --> 21:03.715
It varies with the kind of book it is.

21:03.955 --> 21:12.544
For our books that are on our trade list, we start designing the jacket sometimes before the manuscript is announced.

21:13.165 --> 21:13.706
That's funny.

21:13.786 --> 21:20.874
Unfortunately, sometimes before we have a definite title, because they go in our catalog, our seasonal catalogs.

21:21.515 --> 21:29.445
We're doing them now for the spring catalog, and there are a couple of books on this list that the manuscripts haven't come in yet.

21:30.486 --> 21:31.667
They did that to my new book.

21:32.368 --> 21:32.649
Really?

21:32.669 --> 21:42.160
When you talk about pressure and getting the book done, the jacket was ready, and there was a catalog entry, and they even had the wrong subtitle on the jacket, because I had

21:42.865 --> 21:53.580
I just had a working subtitle just so I could sell it, you know, from the proposal, but that was never intended to be the actual subtitle, and I changed it.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.364
But they went ahead and put it on the dust jacket.

21:56.485 --> 22:00.470
And even at Barnes & Noble, they're still pre-selling it under the old subtitle.

22:01.211 --> 22:01.872
Fix this, will you?

22:01.972 --> 22:02.673
Well, that's the thing.

22:02.734 --> 22:04.256
They pre-sell.

22:04.296 --> 22:07.080
I mean, they promote things before they're done.

22:07.100 --> 22:12.147
Yeah, our catalog ends up, we end up with jackets in the catalog that change.

22:12.734 --> 22:15.857
And we don't consider it the most tragic thing, either.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.920
I mean, it's... Oh, it doesn't hurt, I don't think.

22:17.940 --> 22:18.841
I don't think so, either.

22:18.901 --> 22:22.204
I mean, you know, it's good for a bookseller to have something visual.

22:22.945 --> 22:29.092
And sometimes we get feedback on those, you know, after the fact.

22:29.172 --> 22:33.476
But right now, most of it, you know, it's before the fact.

22:34.638 --> 22:39.843
So for our trade books, we, you know, their jackets are designed at a very early stage.

22:40.324 --> 22:41.425
And for our...

22:41.877 --> 22:43.499
got more scholarly books.

22:43.519 --> 22:47.485
Jackets are designed at the very last minute, unfortunately.

22:48.126 --> 22:50.210
You're just playing with type on the money.

22:50.230 --> 22:55.237
Not necessarily, but we're just very busy.

22:55.277 --> 22:56.599
We've always got a lot of work.

23:00.104 --> 23:04.852
Theoretically, there's a month between when the jacket design is due and when it's got to go to the printer.

23:05.933 --> 23:08.197
Yeah, but a month is just not that long a time.

23:08.217 --> 23:10.500
Especially when you have copy that has to be

23:11.206 --> 23:13.188
Yeah.

23:13.248 --> 23:16.190
Well, theoretically, we've got the jacket copy at that point.

23:16.210 --> 23:21.695
And we've got the, you know, information from anything the author might want to tell us.

23:21.715 --> 23:27.480
And sometimes authors provide pieces of art, you know, of their own that they'd like used on the jacket.

23:27.560 --> 23:32.765
And if we think we can make it work, we'll, you know, we accommodate them on our scholarly books more so.

23:33.506 --> 23:37.189
Do you still do any books without jackets, out of curiosity, or is it...?

23:37.569 --> 23:39.711
Theoretically, but in reality,

23:40.957 --> 23:44.521
You know, a few old series books.

23:44.541 --> 23:51.910
And how do you choose which books are graced with end sheets?

23:52.110 --> 23:52.710
I don't know.

23:52.750 --> 23:57.676
Theoretically, none of them are graced with end sheets anymore, unfortunately.

23:57.696 --> 23:59.999
My first two books had end sheets.

24:00.019 --> 24:01.541
I really miss them.

24:01.561 --> 24:02.221
They're wonderful.

24:02.722 --> 24:03.523
I really miss them.

24:03.563 --> 24:05.225
I think they add a lot to the book.

24:05.966 --> 24:09.650
This gives it a sense of class.

24:09.750 --> 24:09.850
Yeah.

24:10.066 --> 24:13.130
Like they said, it's 50 cents more per book.

24:13.150 --> 24:15.653
I mean, I don't know if that's what they told me.

24:15.713 --> 24:25.366
Well, you know, the way they figure out what something costs per book is a little mysterious to me, because it gets magnified somehow.

24:26.547 --> 24:30.632
They don't really cost 50 cents per book.

24:30.652 --> 24:32.014
That's right.

24:32.034 --> 24:35.078
But they add, like, 50 cents to the price of the book.

24:36.172 --> 24:38.695
I would vote for it to be worth it most of the time.

24:39.876 --> 24:42.178
But it's not up to me, unfortunately.

24:42.238 --> 24:47.644
So, yeah, none of them, but occasionally some of them do get pitchy.

24:47.664 --> 25:01.638
But they're... You know, sometimes it's something as simple as we have, like, a big subsidy for some particular title, and we want to produce it as best, you know, as nicely as we can.

25:05.542 --> 25:05.942
So...

25:06.547 --> 25:12.153
Do you sit in the editorial meetings and the marketing meetings?

25:12.634 --> 25:13.795
No editorial meetings.

25:15.097 --> 25:19.181
Only marketing meetings, only a few.

25:19.241 --> 25:26.469
They have something called the trade launch, where they discuss all the trade books for a particular season.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.432
And it's primarily a marketing meeting.

25:28.572 --> 25:35.980
And I sit in on those, and I try to get the designers to sit in for the books they'll be working on.

25:36.196 --> 25:40.984
I sort of assign them, like, ahead of time, before we have a manuscript, before we've even heard of the book.

25:41.545 --> 25:43.608
Sometimes I give them some to babysit.

25:43.989 --> 25:53.565
So do you think that it is kind of interesting that the designer had gets a title, of course, and gets maybe a paragraph as to what the book's about?

25:53.585 --> 25:54.787
A few paragraphs, yeah.

25:54.967 --> 25:58.353
And then you just say, use your imagination, right?

25:58.373 --> 25:59.655
Just see what you can.

25:59.720 --> 26:09.491
Well, we go to these meetings, you know, the editors go up and talk about what the book is about and who is going to buy this and who it should appeal to, and then the marketing people all kind of chime in and the director.

26:10.032 --> 26:17.380
So we're really, you know, we're getting a feel for how the book, you know, how it should look.

26:19.402 --> 26:22.085
And how do you prepare to be a designer for a book?

26:22.105 --> 26:28.933
I mean, what kind of skills do you find the most that you look for in people who

26:29.572 --> 26:30.333
Tell me something.

26:30.894 --> 26:44.939
Well, I think, you know, well, obviously imagination, and an ability to sort of, you know, conceptualize is good.

26:44.959 --> 26:49.867
You have to think good in terms of scale and size, too.

26:50.007 --> 26:51.350
Yes.

26:52.492 --> 26:54.415
Proportions are critical.

26:54.783 --> 26:58.050
It looks terrible, as a postage stamp, the first one, General Madness.

26:58.070 --> 27:02.298
But if you see it, there's a... Well, almost any book jacket looks terrible that size.

27:02.318 --> 27:03.781
It's that tiny.

27:04.002 --> 27:09.773
If you go to Amazon, you know, you can click on them, which is where I usually go to look at comparable book jackets.

27:09.793 --> 27:12.619
You can click on them, and you get a bigger image.

27:12.639 --> 27:14.543
Yeah.

27:14.864 --> 27:16.487
Should you want to get sued, yeah.

27:16.619 --> 27:18.341
No, I write a week.

27:18.441 --> 27:20.723
I write book reviews, and I send art, you know.

27:20.743 --> 27:22.165
Oh, all right, yeah.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.527
And I used to actually physically have to send it.

27:24.587 --> 27:26.229
Now I just send JPEGs, you know.

27:26.650 --> 27:27.731
Oh, oh, okay, yeah.

27:27.751 --> 27:28.492
Everybody's happy.

27:28.512 --> 27:33.337
The publisher's happy because their book's getting, you know, the pictures being, especially children's books.

27:33.417 --> 27:34.998
I review a lot of children's books.

27:35.859 --> 27:39.743
So I really, you know, I didn't have a specific agenda of things to go over.

27:39.763 --> 27:43.167
I just really want to touch all bases on the building and kind of get

27:43.585 --> 27:44.106
Okay.

27:44.226 --> 27:54.139
Some sense of, you know, what everybody contributes to the... I wondered if you had a, you know, really good list of, like, people who've been here a long time.

27:55.301 --> 27:56.583
Well, I've talked to a few people.

27:56.603 --> 27:57.003
You have?

27:57.043 --> 27:57.364
Okay.

27:57.464 --> 27:59.647
Jonathan Spence today at Michael Lemon.

28:00.168 --> 28:01.369
This should be interesting.

28:02.291 --> 28:02.551
Okay.

28:02.591 --> 28:05.635
He's a historian, and he's a lot of governance here.

28:05.795 --> 28:06.176
Yes.

28:06.617 --> 28:09.080
And really one of the world's great historians.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.784
He originally had this office.

28:12.224 --> 28:12.765
No kidding.

28:13.353 --> 28:14.294
And I don't know why.

28:14.334 --> 28:18.180
It must have been before the press was here.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.241
You think?

28:19.441 --> 28:19.682
Yeah.

28:20.402 --> 28:26.971
Because there's a little piece of paper in the corner that I've left over there somewhere saying this, you know, or this was Jonathan Spence's office.

28:27.172 --> 28:27.712
No wonder why.

28:27.732 --> 28:28.413
Or something like that.

28:28.654 --> 28:28.974
Yeah.

28:28.994 --> 28:34.762
Well, I know Sarah Clark had it for a while when, before the addition was put on the building.

28:35.162 --> 28:40.009
This was a small office, you know, this was kind of dormant here.

28:40.309 --> 28:43.073
So, you know, it had like little, you know...

28:43.559 --> 28:49.786
bent ceilings, and Sarah Clarke worked in here, and... For publicity promotion?

28:49.806 --> 28:50.106
Yeah.

28:50.126 --> 28:51.468
I know Sarah going way back.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.449
Oh, really?

28:52.469 --> 28:53.991
All my days as a book review editor.

28:54.011 --> 28:54.551
Oh, of course, yeah.

28:54.571 --> 28:59.917
And I still review a ton of leo books, in fact, which is... I know Sarah going way back, too, since I've been working.

29:00.037 --> 29:02.660
Yeah.

29:02.680 --> 29:08.527
So I think the note was from his days here, but the press, you know, wasn't always in this building.

29:08.587 --> 29:11.490
We came here from, they were over on New York Street.

29:12.348 --> 29:16.092
So he must have had an office here before it was in the Yale Press.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.314
Yeah, he's been here since the 60s.

29:17.334 --> 29:18.355
He's been here for a long time.

29:18.655 --> 29:18.936
Really?

29:18.956 --> 29:19.656
Yeah.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.919
Yeah, I've got a bio on him.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.523
Do you work with the art books, too, or is that the...?

29:25.543 --> 29:25.663
No.

29:25.984 --> 29:29.187
No, we used to, but now just Patricia and Mary.

29:29.248 --> 29:31.730
So that's done by a whole different division, even the design?

29:32.371 --> 29:32.651
Yes.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.253
They freelance out.

29:34.273 --> 29:34.614
Do they?

29:34.694 --> 29:35.555
Almost all of their books.

29:36.176 --> 29:38.338
One or two titles that...

29:38.622 --> 29:42.508
that they don't have any money in and they ask us to do, but very little.

29:42.528 --> 29:47.996
Yeah, those books, I have the city of Yale, our books are, there's nobody that compares.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.378
They're gorgeous, I think, yeah.

29:49.478 --> 29:54.205
Plus the content is just, it's not just pretty pictures, the scholarship is fabulous.

29:54.225 --> 29:55.086
Yeah, they're great.

29:55.627 --> 29:59.152
And they're involved with all these museums and these exhibitions.

29:59.192 --> 29:59.292
Yeah.

29:59.352 --> 30:08.325
You know, once upon a time we used to do them, but I mean, with the workload here and the kind of schedules they have,

30:08.727 --> 30:11.510
like having to prepare things for museum openings.

30:11.590 --> 30:15.774
And we just can't drop everything else to check proofs, for instance.

30:15.794 --> 30:16.815
And that's what they do.

30:17.516 --> 30:28.687
So any particular books that stand out in your mind as favorites or ones that you take particular pleasure in having, hard in producing?

30:28.707 --> 30:29.167
Oh, let's see.

30:29.968 --> 30:32.671
Maybe the Likens book.

30:32.691 --> 30:32.971
That was huge.

30:32.991 --> 30:36.555
Have you ever seen the Likens book?

30:36.575 --> 30:36.675
Yeah.

30:36.892 --> 30:39.355
Right now I'm going to take a picture of you with it.

30:40.056 --> 30:40.857
Oh, here.

30:41.138 --> 30:42.440
Pictures, too?

30:43.661 --> 30:44.302
Nobody told me.

30:45.183 --> 30:45.824
Not to worry.

30:45.884 --> 31:04.570
This is a... I just... I have my toy with my digital camera these days, so it's... Well, I mean, these, you know, these really oversized books are kind of... They take a lot of time and a lot of effort on many people's part of it.

31:05.393 --> 31:09.898
So those are the ones that stick out in my mind, actually, the ones that are physically big, ridiculously enough.

31:09.938 --> 31:10.719
Well, that's beautiful.

31:10.799 --> 31:11.620
When was that published?

31:15.444 --> 31:17.866
Um, maybe five years ago.

31:17.886 --> 31:18.287
That's inscribed.

31:18.307 --> 31:20.829
This is my signed copy.

31:20.869 --> 31:21.450
Inscribed?

31:22.331 --> 31:23.212
Uh, 2001.

31:23.732 --> 31:24.734
Oh, just hold it like that.

31:24.774 --> 31:28.177
Does it have it like that?

31:28.197 --> 31:28.297
Okay.

31:28.317 --> 31:28.518
Yeah.

31:30.219 --> 31:32.262
Actually, one more where you can be looking at me.

31:32.282 --> 31:34.484
I can look at your, okay.

31:34.504 --> 31:34.624
Sorry.

31:37.456 --> 31:41.360
Oh, that's nice.

31:41.380 --> 31:42.321
That's a lovely picture.

31:42.361 --> 31:42.722
Thank you.

31:43.643 --> 31:50.470
See, look, I kind of coordinate with this jacket, don't I?

31:50.490 --> 31:50.590
Yeah.

31:50.610 --> 31:51.051
See this?

31:51.071 --> 31:56.196
I mean, I thought I'd never go over from film to digital cameras, but you can come right in and see the pictures.

31:56.216 --> 31:57.117
Yeah, you have fun.

31:57.137 --> 31:57.758
It's amazing.

31:58.158 --> 32:01.081
I have yet to use a digital camera, but... That's a nice picture.

32:02.162 --> 32:02.983
How about anything else?

32:03.183 --> 32:04.645
How about another one?

32:05.097 --> 32:14.192
There are so many from over the years, and I don't keep them all because they're, um, they're, you know, there's so many.

32:14.332 --> 32:18.418
Um, well, the Encyclopedia of New England, of course, but... Which I just received as a review of what they'll be doing with this.

32:18.439 --> 32:19.360
Oh, you did, really?

32:19.380 --> 32:20.221
I realized that.

32:20.322 --> 32:20.902
I loved it.

32:21.103 --> 32:22.024
I loved it.

32:22.044 --> 32:23.947
The clams, I mean, what a great idea.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.271
Yeah, I was ready to have them.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.894
I'm my freelancer.

32:28.555 --> 32:29.116
Clams, right?

32:29.136 --> 32:30.117
Somebody must love clams.

32:31.560 --> 32:31.780
Um...

32:32.401 --> 32:39.452
We went through a lot of iterations of that book jacket before we came up with something.

32:41.354 --> 32:45.821
This is very old.

32:52.671 --> 32:53.132
What else?

32:54.875 --> 33:01.885
This was a favorite book, just because it was fun to work on.

33:02.202 --> 33:03.844
Doug Ray's city book.

33:03.864 --> 33:06.388
He keeps it here.

33:06.828 --> 33:14.298
And he's very involved in the... He's very involved with... He actually had a position in the city government for a few years.

33:14.999 --> 33:18.344
And he's... I think he's written a new book since then.

33:18.564 --> 33:25.173
He's very involved with urban design and all that stuff.

33:25.193 --> 33:25.754
And... Yeah.

33:25.774 --> 33:28.597
You know, the politics of it and everything, too.

33:28.617 --> 33:31.281
So it's... Excellent.

33:32.240 --> 33:32.841
Oh, good.

33:38.009 --> 33:41.033
Would you like me to give you any other names of people to talk to?

33:41.154 --> 33:43.477
Or, I mean, people I know who've been here a long time?

33:43.758 --> 33:44.939
Yep, absolutely.

33:45.220 --> 33:52.972
When I talked to Janice, originally, she sort of, and she hasn't been here that long, but she doesn't really, you know, she doesn't really know.

33:53.493 --> 33:58.460
But, you know, I know Deb Bozzi over in the... Deb?

33:58.480 --> 34:00.964
Deb, B-O-Z-Z-I.

34:01.315 --> 34:03.058
B-O-Z-Z-I.

34:03.198 --> 34:04.700
She came here a few months before me.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.163
She's in the marketing department.

34:07.805 --> 34:08.466
What does she do?

34:10.649 --> 34:16.298
Do you have a card, by the way, that I can... I don't really.

34:16.358 --> 34:17.360
If I can touch with you again.

34:17.781 --> 34:19.263
I don't really.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.146
Just give me an email address.

34:21.166 --> 34:21.727
That'll be good.

34:21.967 --> 34:26.153
Okay, it's nancy.ovendovitz.

34:26.654 --> 34:27.936
It's all lowercase, actually.

34:27.956 --> 34:29.078
O-V-E-D-O.

34:29.733 --> 34:30.574
V-I-T-Z.

34:30.715 --> 34:32.217
At Yale.edu.

34:34.961 --> 34:38.848
What kinds are helpful?

34:38.868 --> 34:41.111
I like them.

34:41.132 --> 34:44.637
But it's pre-email, right?

34:46.340 --> 34:56.837
Yeah, and it's what Paul Rand designed many years ago, and I've actually been meaning to

34:58.437 --> 35:02.521
meaning to do something a little different for us now that he's gone.

35:02.541 --> 35:05.463
I don't have a fit if I mess with him.

35:05.563 --> 35:06.904
So Deb and marketing.

35:08.386 --> 35:15.292
And there was a man named Dow Kling who worked in our business office.

35:15.332 --> 35:17.374
He had like John Rollins' job.

35:17.834 --> 35:18.895
Dow, D-O-W.

35:20.476 --> 35:20.677
Dow?

35:20.977 --> 35:22.398
K-L-I-N-G.

35:23.499 --> 35:25.641
And I'm sorry, I don't know how to get a hold of him.

35:25.661 --> 35:26.181
That's everything.

35:26.201 --> 35:26.942
Where did he work?

35:27.175 --> 35:28.978
He was in the business office.

35:28.998 --> 35:30.360
He had John Rollins' job.

35:31.882 --> 35:41.475
He was our business manager.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.118
Did Janice tell you Sally Harris?

35:43.478 --> 35:45.281
Because she would be a great one to talk to.

35:46.562 --> 35:47.484
Very articulate.

35:47.584 --> 35:52.050
She was the senior designer here when I came here.

35:52.531 --> 35:53.993
And she was here for 30 years.

35:55.542 --> 35:56.443
She lives in Vermont.

35:56.483 --> 36:01.369
I can give you her phone number or her email, actually.

36:01.390 --> 36:02.431
We email.

36:04.293 --> 36:08.118
It's a great way to stay in touch with people.

36:09.119 --> 36:18.351
Is there something that characterizes Yale design or is there something that says this is a Yale book?

36:19.152 --> 36:22.056
It's funny you should ask that.

36:23.099 --> 36:24.241
I've never thought so.

36:24.521 --> 36:31.411
And certainly we have never tried to, you know, make them look as if they all belonged here.

36:34.855 --> 36:37.159
You know, we do such a variety of books.

36:37.259 --> 36:39.682
It just didn't seem appropriate for us.

36:41.244 --> 36:43.267
But we try to make them all look good.

36:43.347 --> 36:48.314
We try to make them all well-designed and easy to read.

36:49.456 --> 36:52.600
But other than that, I would have to say no in terms of the book.

36:53.288 --> 37:21.996
There is a university printer, though, who just this past week sent me his proposed guidelines for Yale design, which he mainly intends to be up for brochures and other sort of ephemera that the university publishes, will not apply to jackets.

37:22.145 --> 37:34.942
But, you know, I think maybe in our other printed pieces that we will, uh... So is there a particular type that you think is favored?

37:34.962 --> 37:35.783
By my department?

37:35.803 --> 37:36.164
Yeah.

37:36.464 --> 37:37.305
There are a few.

37:37.585 --> 37:40.109
There are a few fonts we all love.

37:40.129 --> 37:40.970
Like, for instance?

37:41.931 --> 37:44.114
Um... The Sands.

37:45.936 --> 37:46.197
Mm-hmm.

37:46.237 --> 37:46.597
The Sans.

37:47.398 --> 37:48.900
Uh... S-A-N-S.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.663
No D.

37:50.683 --> 37:50.903
Um...

37:53.903 --> 37:55.084
Uh, Galliard.

37:56.326 --> 38:00.551
G-A-L-L-I-A-R-D.

38:00.571 --> 38:10.704
Um, Torino has certainly been a big, T-O-R, T-O-R-I-N-O, has been a big, um, sort of display font.

38:10.724 --> 38:11.845
You don't use it for a text.

38:11.865 --> 38:22.358
Um, Futura as well, F-U-T-U-R-A, which is an old sans-serif font. You know what a sans-serif is?

38:24.295 --> 38:34.770
And who makes those choices, those decisions?

38:34.790 --> 38:35.190
The designers.

38:35.210 --> 38:35.791
The designers.

38:36.172 --> 38:38.415
Again, the freelancers that you send out to?

38:39.156 --> 38:40.298
Well, we have a staff here.

38:40.358 --> 38:41.319
There's five of us here.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.143
So you have a staff of five people?

38:44.163 --> 38:50.472
Well, five here and me.

38:50.722 --> 38:54.386
We do most of the designs here.

38:54.446 --> 38:56.688
And then the jackets, the other things you send out?

38:57.569 --> 38:58.310
Not necessarily.

38:58.350 --> 39:01.313
We do most of the jackets here, too.

39:01.353 --> 39:04.416
So you said you free— We freelance out a small proportion.

39:04.436 --> 39:05.677
A small proportion, okay.

39:05.697 --> 39:06.298
Yes, small.

39:07.279 --> 39:10.162
And so what kind of a book would you normally form out?

39:12.164 --> 39:15.868
One that I don't want to touch with a ten-foot pole.

39:16.102 --> 39:19.427
So we won't identify what books those are?

39:19.587 --> 39:27.880
Well, it would be sometimes a book that's especially difficult and we know is going to be really time-consuming.

39:29.582 --> 39:33.308
We might freelance out the text.

39:37.334 --> 39:44.505
Sometimes I work, well, for instance, on that Encyclopedia of New England jacket, you know, I will do a certain number of designs.

39:44.603 --> 39:48.947
And then I just, I can't look at it anymore.

39:49.868 --> 39:51.390
And then I'll send it out to somebody else.

39:51.950 --> 39:54.293
So let's just start, I use that as a case study.

39:54.333 --> 40:03.442
So what were some of the possibilities for that encyclopedia of New England that you liked but didn't, that you, that... Yeah, I think I probably threw them all out.

40:03.622 --> 40:04.463
I had a pile of them.

40:04.723 --> 40:13.412
Well, you know, I get input before I even start designing, especially on something like that, that everybody's sort of nervous about, and it's a big book for us.

40:14.067 --> 40:15.308
So some of the ideas.

40:15.348 --> 40:15.849
Let's see.

40:15.889 --> 40:18.271
There was white picket fences.

40:19.693 --> 40:21.394
I was interested.

40:21.454 --> 40:25.658
There were weather vanes.

40:26.419 --> 40:26.940
Oh, nice.

40:26.960 --> 40:27.340
Okay.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.541
All saying New England, right?

40:28.962 --> 40:29.302
Yeah.

40:29.422 --> 40:35.788
There was, you know, shutters, green shutters on a white house.

40:35.949 --> 40:41.374
There was trees.

40:43.295 --> 40:44.416
trees in full colors.

40:44.537 --> 40:45.798
I just like to say a full-age tree.

40:48.101 --> 40:54.409
So it's interesting, you go from artifactual to natural, so that something was human-made or a natural scene.

40:54.529 --> 40:54.970
Yes, yes.

40:56.352 --> 40:58.975
Because any of them can evoke New England, really.

40:59.536 --> 41:00.377
Sure.

41:00.397 --> 41:01.518
There was a red barn.

41:02.399 --> 41:06.985
There was a whole scene of a New England village, like a Grandma Moses painting.

41:07.626 --> 41:10.129
And everybody was pretty happy with that for a while.

41:13.130 --> 41:18.196
The freelancer also went through a number of iterations of this.

41:19.558 --> 41:22.181
This was a more painful jacket than most.

41:24.384 --> 41:26.887
There was, um, I had a lobster.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.369
I had a lobster on one.

41:31.754 --> 41:36.219
So the point is to have something that evokes New England, but it's not a cliché, I guess, as well?

41:36.480 --> 41:39.584
Well, yes, you'd hope for that, yeah.

41:39.604 --> 41:39.964
Yes.

41:40.180 --> 41:42.142
That's why I think the clams are great.

41:42.643 --> 41:43.263
I think so, too.

41:43.644 --> 41:48.128
Because it's just who expects to see a bush of clams or whatever on the check, you know?

41:48.148 --> 41:51.532
You expect to see a covered bridge or a... Right, a covered bridge.

41:51.552 --> 41:54.174
That was another idea, yeah.

41:54.234 --> 41:58.018
And all are beautiful to the shore, but not especially new.

41:58.038 --> 42:00.861
Right, and kind of cliched, yeah.

42:00.881 --> 42:08.449
Yeah, I hate to use that word, but, you know, when you think of the covered bridge and the foliage and the seashore or whatever, but the clams are great.

42:09.188 --> 42:13.252
Did you get a consensus on that?

42:13.793 --> 42:14.573
Immediate.

42:14.814 --> 42:17.076
Is there a eureka moment where you say that's it?

42:18.597 --> 42:19.058
Pretty much.

42:19.258 --> 42:20.860
Well, the freelancer sent him.

42:20.900 --> 42:21.681
I printed him out.

42:21.981 --> 42:24.744
He had a few different ones.

42:24.984 --> 42:28.688
And I pulled out the clams and I said, this is great.

42:29.529 --> 42:31.270
And I showed it to the group.

42:31.511 --> 42:33.172
There's a group who approves the jackets.

42:33.272 --> 42:35.955
And everybody loved the clams almost immediately.

42:37.133 --> 42:37.874
Interesting, huh?

42:38.194 --> 42:44.601
And here it is, because it is the latest in a series of very successful Yale books, these encyclopedias.

42:44.681 --> 42:45.602
Encyclopedias, yeah.

42:45.622 --> 42:49.125
Which have taken off in their own way, the New York one.

42:49.746 --> 42:50.227
Yeah.

42:50.287 --> 42:53.250
And a number of them are just fabulous books.

42:53.590 --> 42:54.771
Well, thanks.

42:54.791 --> 42:55.232
I love them.

42:55.312 --> 42:55.772
I have them all.

42:55.812 --> 42:56.693
Me too.

42:57.094 --> 42:57.454
Me too.

42:57.474 --> 43:00.317
I was so fascinated reading that New England encyclopedia.

43:00.377 --> 43:01.318
I was checking proofs.

43:01.418 --> 43:06.163
I just kept getting waylaid by the text.

43:06.564 --> 43:06.904
Yeah, good stuff.

43:07.137 --> 43:08.138
Where are you from?

43:08.399 --> 43:09.240
Albany, New York.

43:09.260 --> 43:11.643
Ah, you're a New York lady.

43:11.663 --> 43:11.763
Yeah.

43:11.783 --> 43:12.164
And you?

43:12.304 --> 43:12.805
Where are you from?

43:12.825 --> 43:14.207
Oh, I'm from Massachusetts.

43:14.227 --> 43:17.752
I've lived most of my life, except for, you know, periods of school.

43:17.772 --> 43:17.872
Yeah.

43:19.254 --> 43:20.736
And worked up there for newspapers.

43:20.776 --> 43:27.024
I've been writing books for 15 years now, and wishing I'd started it earlier.

43:27.185 --> 43:27.886
Really?

43:27.906 --> 43:28.226
Yeah.

43:28.246 --> 43:29.488
It's just been great.

43:29.508 --> 43:30.529
Oh, that's nice.

43:30.549 --> 43:34.815
And able to... Do you have, like, an amount of time every day that you spend writing, or...?

43:34.998 --> 43:36.948
What I'm writing, I'm writing all the time.

43:37.250 --> 43:38.255
Really?

43:38.275 --> 43:38.396
Yeah.

43:38.416 --> 43:40.587
I'm between books, like this Yale thing.
