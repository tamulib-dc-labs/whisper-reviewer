WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:17.132
I guess the first question everybody is asking you is, why?

00:17.152 --> 00:17.953
Why did I do that?

00:17.973 --> 00:18.774
Well, are you obsessed?

00:19.295 --> 00:22.158
Oh, I was engaged.

00:22.798 --> 00:27.684
I'm obsessed with music as well, so I have a number of obsessions.

00:28.304 --> 00:31.708
But I certainly became

00:32.768 --> 00:44.840
in this project, partly because of another translation that I had not discovered, but come across in connection with some other work I was doing.

00:45.701 --> 01:02.117
This is a German translation by Buber and Rosenzweig, and that was so unusual that it, I guess you could say, inspired me to experiment a little bit on my own, just with a chapter or two, just for fun.

01:02.401 --> 01:08.229
to see what would happen, and the result was so different than anything I'd ever seen that it really intrigued me.

01:08.289 --> 01:10.552
Working from what texts here?

01:12.114 --> 01:12.755
Myself, you mean?

01:12.775 --> 01:12.995
Yeah.

01:13.796 --> 01:22.107
Working from a standard Hebrew text, but, you know, with commentaries and all the paraphernalia that scholars use.

01:22.768 --> 01:28.295
Now, of course, there are five books here, and this took, what, 27 years?

01:28.315 --> 01:29.657
Well, from beginning to end, yeah.

01:31.662 --> 01:36.287
I didn't live a hermit's life and do nothing else from beginning to end.

01:37.369 --> 01:40.452
But again, there were other scholarly things that you were doing there at the meantime.

01:40.472 --> 01:40.993
There were some.

01:41.053 --> 01:43.836
I really wanted to do this more than anything.

01:43.856 --> 01:47.681
This was really the focus of what I wanted to do.

01:47.821 --> 01:53.168
I saw it as a combination of scholarly and artistic endeavor.

01:54.169 --> 01:55.791
And the premise being what?

01:56.952 --> 02:00.336
What are the shortcomings of other interests?

02:00.653 --> 02:11.304
The shortcomings of other translations, such as they are, are that they have as their focus the language into which they're translating.

02:11.344 --> 02:28.281
They're trying to create an English text which is comfortable and flowing and idiomatic, which is always a goal of translation, but you can lose a lot when you do that as well.

02:28.683 --> 02:38.118
If you try and put it in a 20th century English voice, then you miss some of the ancient dress, some of the rough feel of the Hebrew.

02:40.482 --> 02:44.448
And so I started seeing that it was possible to do it another way as a balance to that.

02:45.230 --> 02:56.007
And I also saw that that was helpful to me and to other people in getting them to rethink and re-hear these very familiar stories and texts.

02:56.560 --> 03:03.066
Is it, in your view, a Bible then for your generation, or do you, I don't know, I hope, on the other hand?

03:03.086 --> 03:04.227
Yeah, I hope it will last.

03:04.267 --> 03:08.451
I don't see it, you know, aimed at a particular generation.

03:08.671 --> 03:10.673
It certainly comes out of a particular generation.

03:10.693 --> 03:16.819
I mean, the fact that I started it in the late 60s is probably not completely accidental, although I'd like to think that it is.

03:18.681 --> 03:26.128
But, you know, every generation has to discover the classics for itself, you know, whether you're an actor or a musician or

03:26.918 --> 03:33.764
or whatever you are, you always go back to the classics, but it doesn't mean that you accept the way they've always been done.

03:33.784 --> 03:39.449
It's been said that every generation requires its own edition of Shakespeare.

03:39.589 --> 03:40.550
Yeah, sure, that's right.

03:40.570 --> 03:46.215
And I wonder if you feel similarly about... Sure, sure.

03:46.755 --> 03:50.398
I don't see this as the translation for the 90s.

03:51.119 --> 03:55.643
This is not a translation which takes the text and bends it to

03:56.737 --> 03:58.399
to ideological concerns.

03:59.340 --> 04:07.768
It's not like some recent translations that try to address issues of sexism and so on.

04:07.788 --> 04:13.694
I won't go out of my way to avoid those, but I'm trying to reproduce the text in the way that I hear it.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.576
If it's an ancient text, that's what it is.

04:15.696 --> 04:17.037
I'm not trying to doctor it up.

04:18.138 --> 04:23.183
I think when people say 27 years, but you have to go, for me, I love notes,

04:23.686 --> 04:28.912
I love annotations, and I just love all this stuff.

04:28.932 --> 04:32.456
Of course, I imagine writing these... That was hard.

04:32.476 --> 04:33.637
That was harder than the translation.

04:33.657 --> 04:34.298
I bet it was.

04:34.899 --> 04:50.757
Yeah, because I had to put myself in the shoes of some imaginary reader and figure out what would be useful answers, or what were the questions, really, that I thought people would be interested in, and what were simply and clearly written answers.

04:51.108 --> 04:55.937
Do you have, actually, a reader in mind?

04:55.957 --> 05:07.939
Well, partly a reader who cares enough to read the book, not just to zoom through something that's easy, but who cares to linger a little bit for a little while.

05:08.480 --> 05:13.048
When you say the book, you're fortunate as a book with a small V or a capital V?

05:13.552 --> 05:15.314
Both, really.

05:15.334 --> 05:19.340
You know, I mean, it's, you can't... I mean, this is a literary exercise as much as it is.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.264
Yeah, it's a literary exercise, but you can't ignore what it is.

05:23.686 --> 05:26.369
Much as one would like to sometimes... Do so at your palate.

05:26.389 --> 05:27.972
Well, right, I mean, you can't do that.

05:30.074 --> 05:43.052
Remember, I've approached it also, in a way, as a teacher, as one who wants to guide the reader a little bit and supply information that he or she might not

05:43.842 --> 05:45.004
encounter otherwise.

05:45.705 --> 05:53.860
In many settings where the Bible was read, let's say in a church or synagogue, sometimes there is a commentary on the side, but often there isn't.

05:53.880 --> 06:01.133
And so people are left to sit there and react to the words, but the words aren't always clear, and they're sometimes difficult.

06:01.774 --> 06:07.504
It is rather unusual, isn't it, that the Bible should be a translation?

06:08.277 --> 06:09.719
be attempted by one person.

06:09.919 --> 06:11.021
This is kind of a project.

06:11.341 --> 06:17.269
Well, yeah, I mean, don't forget, this is still only part one, so, you know.

06:17.429 --> 06:20.053
Is it the Old Testament that you're going to be playing?

06:20.173 --> 06:22.536
This is, you know, the project is the Old Testament.

06:22.616 --> 06:29.445
I mean, I've just done part one of four, so we're not there yet, you know.

06:30.907 --> 06:37.356
It's a little bit unusual, although, you know, early on in the history of the English Bible, there were individuals like Tim Dale,

06:37.724 --> 06:43.894
Well, we try not to mention that.

06:44.435 --> 06:47.359
And also, there were a couple of gentlemen early in the century.

06:50.524 --> 06:51.666
Was it Goodspeed, I think?

06:51.706 --> 06:54.010
And also, what's his name?

06:54.030 --> 06:55.252
A Scottish guy.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.016
There have been several other attempts like that.

06:58.036 --> 06:58.737
And attending.

06:58.757 --> 07:01.462
There was a wonderful book.

07:01.482 --> 07:04.066
I guess, was it Yale University Press?

07:04.086 --> 07:05.588
A Modern English Spelling, the big one?

07:05.737 --> 07:12.363
Yeah, but there was also a book about Tyndale, and actually it was by the same fellow, I think, who brought out that.

07:12.444 --> 07:13.425
Daniel, I think is the one?

07:13.625 --> 07:16.467
Yeah, I just bought, actually, the translation itself a couple weeks ago.

07:16.488 --> 07:18.630
It's real interesting.

07:18.650 --> 07:23.675
I didn't realize that so much of the Tyndale Bible went into the King James.

07:23.695 --> 07:24.295
Oh, yeah.

07:24.315 --> 07:26.257
He's really the one who did it.

07:26.317 --> 07:27.118
He's the man.

07:28.479 --> 07:29.821
And you talk about the great ironies.

07:29.881 --> 07:33.364
I mean, he went abroad, they hunted him down, and...

07:33.817 --> 07:39.966
And Sir Thomas More was one of the champions of Chase, and then, of course, along comes the King James.

07:39.986 --> 07:45.915
Well, even within a few years of his death, they allowed English translation, so he really just missed it.

07:46.155 --> 07:51.022
He missed the deadline, you might say, unfortunately.

07:51.042 --> 08:01.878
I guess it is a little unusual for one person to do it, but I did it partly because it felt like to have some kind of unified vision would be helpful.

08:03.360 --> 08:03.520
I've

08:03.820 --> 08:22.139
I haven't done a lot of interviews with translators, but it certainly does fascinate me, because those that I have talked with usually contend, and also people who are translated, that the book, when it's rendered into another language, almost becomes a different work.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.381
Well, it does, it does.

08:24.421 --> 08:30.688
Sure, I mean, that's certainly true of the Bible itself.

08:31.681 --> 08:38.851
community has read it over the centuries, it has become a different book anyway, regardless of whether they even translate it or not.

08:40.393 --> 08:48.324
One of the fascinating things about the Bible is that it remains the same on the page, but it magically changes depending on who's got a hold of it.

08:49.966 --> 08:53.892
So even when it's not translated, it means different things to different people.

08:56.595 --> 09:00.000
And it may be because we invest so much of ourselves in the book.

09:00.352 --> 09:09.200
It always changes, but the translations have certainly created other works.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.461
Not the legitimate, it's just other.

09:11.042 --> 09:13.264
Of course, it certainly does the structure.

09:13.664 --> 09:18.368
It really does flow like poetry now, doesn't it?

09:18.388 --> 09:22.852
Yeah, well, that's why we tried to do a little bit to bring out that oral quality.

09:22.872 --> 09:24.073
Also, to slow readers down.

09:24.233 --> 09:29.498
Instead of zipping through a paragraph, you have to weigh the lines and see what's being said.

09:30.035 --> 09:47.662
Is this a case of actually, I don't know, writing my own book, I don't mean to talk about myself, but I'm one of these persons of every sense, I mean, you're endlessly polishing sentences, and of course with the computers, it's a blessing and a curse.

09:49.165 --> 09:50.727
Are you one of these obsessive

09:50.909 --> 09:55.456
people when it comes to really insisting on the perfect, precise work?

09:55.977 --> 09:57.499
As close as you can get, you know.

09:57.599 --> 09:58.641
But until you're happy with it.

09:58.661 --> 10:00.704
Do you wake up in the night and say, aha, that's it?

10:00.724 --> 10:02.046
Once in a while, yeah.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.390
Just solutions, seeking solutions.

10:04.410 --> 10:04.930
Absolutely.

10:05.271 --> 10:10.579
I mean, that's part of the fun of it, is that it becomes a puzzle, you know, something to be solved.

10:12.983 --> 10:16.268
And then, you know, you settle on it, and six months later you change your mind.

10:16.288 --> 10:18.992
You hear somebody read it out loud and say, no, no, no, that's not right.

10:19.664 --> 10:21.286
So it is a curse.

10:21.807 --> 10:26.572
You know, if you're a musician, you can come out the next night and do it better for an actor.

10:26.833 --> 10:27.694
Are you a musician?

10:28.255 --> 10:32.940
Oh, well, on an amateur level, but I listen to a lot of music.

10:32.960 --> 10:33.941
You don't play any musicians?

10:33.961 --> 10:35.263
Well, of course.

10:35.283 --> 10:36.525
No, I used to play the piano.

10:36.545 --> 10:37.306
I did a little singing.

10:37.326 --> 10:39.528
It probably helps to have a hearing, though, doesn't it?

10:39.668 --> 10:40.570
I would think so.

10:40.590 --> 10:41.991
Do you read any of this aloud?

10:42.192 --> 10:42.832
Oh, yeah.

10:42.852 --> 10:43.393
Oh, yeah.

10:43.880 --> 10:53.532
In fact, when I do the final draft, I usually record the Hebrew text, and then I play it back and follow the English with it to get a sense of, you know, I'm on the left track.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.314
And so it takes a long time.

10:55.334 --> 11:00.821
And is your wife conscripted to be with everybody?

11:00.841 --> 11:02.023
Not as much for that.

11:02.403 --> 11:04.686
You know, I mean, she's kind of busy herself.

11:04.886 --> 11:08.991
She would love to do that, but time doesn't always work out, though.

11:09.372 --> 11:10.533
And where did you work?

11:10.553 --> 11:12.115
She's a rabbi, really, actually.

11:13.141 --> 11:13.982
In where?

11:14.183 --> 11:16.907
In Cambridge.

11:16.927 --> 11:25.159
Now, you're obviously an academic and a teacher, but a professional translator as well, right?

11:25.940 --> 11:26.501
Well, I don't know.

11:26.581 --> 11:33.571
I mean, I make my living as a professor, so the translation is my scholarly pursuit.

11:33.631 --> 11:38.799
I don't translate for a living in the sense of get phone calls from people who read material translated.

11:38.819 --> 11:40.221
No, it's really focused on this.

11:40.802 --> 11:42.945
And this is the only language that you would work for?

11:43.280 --> 11:47.864
There are translators who do work on a variety of languages.

11:47.924 --> 11:54.510
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't do anything else, although I know that there was this German piece that was useful.

11:54.530 --> 11:56.391
I don't translate books from German.

11:56.411 --> 12:01.275
I guess sometimes the best translators actually are people who are not native to the time.

12:01.295 --> 12:02.136
I don't know if that's true.

12:02.176 --> 12:03.617
I don't know.

12:03.637 --> 12:03.898
I don't know.

12:03.918 --> 12:08.321
William Weaver has a tagline, so it's wonderful.

12:08.782 --> 12:12.645
Wasn't it Pasternak who translated Shakespeare into the Russian ones?

12:12.727 --> 12:19.799
That's one of the reasons that Shakespeare is so beloved in Russian, because Pasternak was the translator.

12:19.819 --> 12:20.180
Well, right.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.689
You created the classic and you took a poet to do it.

12:27.031 --> 12:33.923
It's often said also that the only great literary work produced by a committee is the King James Bible.

12:34.143 --> 12:35.045
It's true.

12:35.065 --> 12:36.127
It's amazing what they did.

12:36.147 --> 12:38.110
I don't know how the committee was able to do it.

12:38.765 --> 12:39.866
They didn't pull that off.

12:39.887 --> 12:40.487
They did.

12:40.868 --> 12:43.632
Well, they were very conscientious and they were good scholars.

12:44.112 --> 12:54.066
I think it had something to do with the fact that they lived at a time when the level of English was so rich and high.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.792
They were living at exactly the best time to produce an English classic.

12:59.513 --> 13:03.398
Not that they don't deserve credit, but the atmosphere was such.

13:03.438 --> 13:04.620
Look at the people who were around.

13:04.853 --> 13:06.155
Well, right.

13:06.235 --> 13:10.983
If Shakespeare and Ben Johnson are your local playwrights, then how far back can they be?

13:11.003 --> 13:19.857
Anthony Burgess actually writes, wrote that, he made a case for Shakespeare working on that book.

13:19.877 --> 13:21.019
Oh, really?

13:21.039 --> 13:21.640
That's interesting.

13:21.660 --> 13:29.713
He picks one of the psalms that he suggests that he did, and he says Shakespeare, there's such and such a word he changed to Shakespeare.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.702
In other words, he changed the spear.

13:31.822 --> 13:32.503
Oh, no.

13:33.044 --> 13:34.145
That's cute.

13:34.446 --> 13:35.167
You never know.

13:35.547 --> 13:36.629
Maybe he did.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.029
Why not?

13:37.610 --> 13:38.611
Threw in a song.

13:38.972 --> 13:39.272
I love it.

13:39.873 --> 13:41.715
It's kind of cute.

13:43.017 --> 13:44.359
Are you mindful when you're doing this?

13:44.419 --> 13:45.821
I'm glad I'm doing the Bible.

13:46.502 --> 13:48.484
This is a big deal.

13:48.524 --> 13:49.626
I don't want to mess this up.

13:51.608 --> 13:51.809
Yeah.

13:51.889 --> 13:56.595
It's also a time when there are many translations around.

13:57.402 --> 14:03.750
So, you know, if I were the only one doing this in the last 50 years, I might feel differently about it.

14:03.830 --> 14:11.140
I feel that I have a lot of colleagues who are working on similar things, and so I see myself as one of them.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.725
I don't, I'm not the only alternative way to do this.

14:15.406 --> 14:18.149
At what point did it come, the shotgun Bible?

14:18.169 --> 14:19.531
At some point last year.

14:19.912 --> 14:20.833
Not really.

14:20.853 --> 14:21.333
I think.

14:21.474 --> 14:26.380
I mean, my aim was certainly to do the five books, and then to take a deep breath and see what was happening.

14:26.512 --> 14:27.854
But that's wonderful, man.

14:27.914 --> 14:31.359
Was it under contract at that point, or all this stuff?

14:31.379 --> 14:33.102
Well, no, it's been under contract since 1981.

14:35.044 --> 14:35.725
With Schocken?

14:35.745 --> 14:37.768
With Schocken.

14:37.808 --> 14:41.133
Which is, fortunately for me, now a part of Random House.

14:41.193 --> 14:45.279
And so, you know, it was due to five books, although there was some discussion about going on.

14:45.299 --> 14:51.989
But then, you know, with any project like this, you try and finish the first part, and then you see where you are.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.994
But it's appropriate to see it as a long term.

14:55.014 --> 14:55.995
It must be rewarding.

14:57.123 --> 14:59.267
responsiveness.

14:59.287 --> 15:03.453
Who could have anticipated a page one of you in the United States?

15:03.473 --> 15:04.335
I really didn't.

15:04.395 --> 15:11.547
It's gotten a lot of attention and I suppose that has something to do with the general tenor of things these days.

15:12.328 --> 15:19.981
Searching for spirituality and maybe despairing over the budget talks and whatever else is going on.

15:20.001 --> 15:22.725
Do you ever feel that you're toiling in

15:23.752 --> 15:27.056
you know, I'm doing this, and will anybody care?

15:27.237 --> 15:37.611
No, that has never bothered me, because there were always, from the beginning, there were always at least small groups of people who were interested, and who used even drafts to study.

15:38.211 --> 15:38.572
That's good.

15:38.612 --> 15:39.373
That's important.

15:39.393 --> 15:45.321
I mean, I've talked to a couple of good friends of mine who are musicians, and one of the great things about being a

15:45.773 --> 15:49.176
musician is that you can instantly respond to your work.

15:49.196 --> 15:49.617
That's right.

15:49.957 --> 15:53.160
You know, you perform something on the stage, and you know immediately.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.281
I know that.

15:54.441 --> 16:03.150
That has occurred to me, and it's one of the things that makes us a little bit difficult, because there is enormous delayed gratification involved.

16:03.210 --> 16:06.834
When I have my musical fantasies, that's certainly one of the issues.

16:07.514 --> 16:09.636
You do get much more of a direct response.

16:09.656 --> 16:11.318
And how about the scholarly community?

16:11.538 --> 16:12.439
Have you heard much

16:12.554 --> 16:14.035
So far, not.

16:14.396 --> 16:14.876
So far, not.

16:14.896 --> 16:20.421
In the past, you know, I have had reactions, pro and con, of various kinds.

16:21.121 --> 16:22.262
You know, it's pretty predictable.

16:23.583 --> 16:41.599
Is there a sense in any quarters that maybe, you know, you're treading on... I know academics have a way of staking out draft, you know, becoming very proprietary about... I know I found this in my own work, being a journalist going out...

16:42.203 --> 16:47.872
you know, daring to go into an area that somebody spent 30 years doing, you know, like Henry Huntington.

16:47.892 --> 16:51.758
I spent 30 years of his life doing a biography of Henry Huntington.

16:51.778 --> 16:57.247
I was just out interested in some, I mean, I was like I was a, you know.

16:57.267 --> 16:57.727
A trespasser?

16:57.807 --> 17:00.872
A jump over, you know.

17:00.892 --> 17:10.928
Well, you know, look, the, the, doing a project like this certainly gets more attention than a, than a narrower technical

17:11.077 --> 17:17.445
I suppose that is frustrating to people.

17:17.465 --> 17:24.595
But I think from the beginning I was interested in reaching a wide audience.

17:24.615 --> 17:25.816
You know, were you mindful?

17:25.836 --> 17:32.224
There are Bibles out there that are quite politically correct.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.567
Were you mindful at all?

17:35.409 --> 17:40.375
Tell me about your attitude as a consideration.

17:40.490 --> 17:45.695
Not in the translation, but in the commentary, it certainly was an issue.

17:46.556 --> 17:55.584
Whether, you know, in stories where people wipe out some other group, or women are treated a certain way.

17:55.684 --> 17:59.027
And I made some reference in the notes in the commentary, too.

17:59.047 --> 18:00.969
So at least bringing up the issue.

18:01.329 --> 18:05.874
But in the actual translation itself, how were you guided?

18:05.894 --> 18:06.634
Really by the text?

18:06.654 --> 18:09.417
Really by the text, yeah.

18:10.308 --> 18:18.861
You know, when you translate the name Adam, which is really not a name, but a designation, it doesn't mean a human being.

18:18.981 --> 18:21.004
It's not the word necessarily for male.

18:21.785 --> 18:30.639
So there I could use humankind, and I was happy about that because that means my own approach, but only because the text permitted it.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.544
If I felt the text didn't allow that, I would not have done it.

18:34.564 --> 18:38.290
And Kristen, the name you used for God,

18:38.506 --> 18:39.247
Tell me about that.

18:39.307 --> 18:42.009
That's an awfully difficult word.

18:42.029 --> 18:42.710
Yeah, yeah.

18:42.850 --> 18:50.958
Well, in the Hebrew text, it's traditionally printed either that way or with substitute vowels.

18:51.238 --> 18:56.684
So Jews traditionally for 2,000 years have not pronounced the name as written.

18:56.704 --> 18:59.506
I wanted to convey some of that sense.

18:59.566 --> 19:06.353
I mean, everybody, Christians included, have translated it as the Lord or something else anyway.

19:06.923 --> 19:11.855
So I wanted to make the reader aware that there's this two-stage thing going on.

19:11.875 --> 19:15.965
I included a whole page at the beginning of the book saying, you know, this is what you should do.

19:15.985 --> 19:17.709
Not everybody will read that.

19:17.729 --> 19:23.683
With a project that has taken so much time, was it difficult to maintain it?

19:24.035 --> 19:26.939
consistent tone in the continuity, or did you have changing?

19:27.079 --> 19:28.141
Were we all changing?

19:28.161 --> 19:29.423
Well, yeah, I did change somewhat.

19:30.044 --> 19:34.770
The books themselves changed somewhat, you know, so there are passages that are more flowing than others.

19:35.431 --> 19:45.766
Because most scholars hear different voices in the text, others, you know, they're maybe pieces from different traditions, and so the vocabulary changes.

19:45.886 --> 19:49.171
There are some passages that are long and did, and others that are incredibly brief.

19:49.191 --> 19:49.992
So I tried to

19:50.528 --> 19:59.239
really follow the terrain of the text and not impose one monolithic tone on it if I could.

19:59.259 --> 20:00.721
I don't know if I'm succeeding.

20:00.901 --> 20:04.085
What's your timetable for the remaining four books?

20:04.105 --> 20:06.528
Well, I hope the next book will be done in about three years.

20:07.389 --> 20:09.952
And beyond that, we're still trying to figure out.

20:09.972 --> 20:11.615
And you're how old now?

20:11.655 --> 20:13.317
48.

20:13.937 --> 20:15.479
It won't take until I'm 100.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.945
You can do it at C&C at 3 by the time you're 60 at least.

20:20.245 --> 20:21.066
Yeah, I would think so.

20:21.086 --> 20:21.907
And where are you now?

20:22.729 --> 20:26.735
Well, I'm doing some material on book two.

20:26.755 --> 20:30.921
I've already done pieces of it in the past, you know, for courses and other things.

20:30.941 --> 20:32.263
Clearly you don't want to be rushed.

20:32.704 --> 20:33.705
You enjoy this.

20:33.725 --> 20:34.646
Yeah, I enjoy it.

20:34.967 --> 20:40.515
There's no sense in being rushed because you want to weigh what's out there.

20:40.675 --> 20:44.681
There's good scholarship out there and discoveries and various other things.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.088
Yeah, it's a slow process.

20:49.304 --> 20:54.370
Were there any big surprises for you remaining with the text?

20:54.390 --> 20:59.036
You knew very well, and yet when you couldn't translate it.

20:59.056 --> 21:10.089
I think that I haven't really paid enough attention to the way in which everything is woven together.

21:10.109 --> 21:11.371
It's a very extraordinary text.

21:11.932 --> 21:14.755
If you look at ancient books, there are plenty of books that

21:16.473 --> 21:18.816
that are parallel to what's in here.

21:18.856 --> 21:21.559
So there are other books that have stories about creation.

21:21.579 --> 21:24.222
There are other books that have lists of laws.

21:24.262 --> 21:27.887
There are other books that talk about sacrifices and other books of poetry.

21:28.568 --> 21:35.857
But there's literally nothing else that I know of in the ancient world that combines all of them and weaves them in and out.

21:35.897 --> 21:41.163
So in a book like Numbers, book four, you'll have a story and then another chapter of laws and then a poem.

21:41.183 --> 21:44.387
It's a very unique kind of thing.

21:44.755 --> 21:51.065
So although I knew that, when you get down on this kind of microscopic level, you really see it going on.

21:51.125 --> 21:55.051
It's remarkable the way in which it's all woven together somehow.

21:55.552 --> 22:04.546
It's not unified in the sense of perfectly put together architecturally, but there are echoes and there are connections that are amazing.

22:04.566 --> 22:06.168
So that's part of it.

22:06.188 --> 22:10.816
So you must have an enormous respect then for those who made this down.

22:10.876 --> 22:11.537
Oh, sure.

22:11.557 --> 22:12.298
Oh, yeah.

22:12.616 --> 22:16.560
How about voice, getting the voice right?

22:16.580 --> 22:18.982
Was that a problem at all?

22:19.323 --> 22:21.665
A number of voices, and you didn't say that you saw it.

22:21.685 --> 22:22.786
Yeah, yeah.

22:22.806 --> 22:33.577
Well, again, you try and follow the contours of the text, and if your way of dealing with it is consistent, then it does read differently on different points.

22:33.597 --> 22:39.563
I certainly haven't tried to impose one voice overall in the text.

22:39.903 --> 22:40.564
I don't know, Richard James does.

22:41.523 --> 22:44.587
you know, these poetic lines help me distinguish that.

22:47.590 --> 22:59.786
And in creating these actual lines, I imagine you would just allow the syntax and the... Yeah, you have to rely somewhat on your ear.

22:59.886 --> 23:09.117
There are indications in Hebrew Bibles there's an old system, it's at least a thousand years old and probably older, of reading that's...

23:09.822 --> 23:13.686
Some people take as punctuation and others as signs to be sung.

23:13.946 --> 23:17.530
And, you know, I certainly paid attention to that stuff.

23:17.550 --> 23:20.533
I wasn't totally bound by it.

23:20.553 --> 23:24.417
In the end, the divisions are a little bit arbitrary.

23:24.537 --> 23:32.245
And do you have, I think you might have touched on this earlier, but do you have a sense of who the reader of readings and reading this book?

23:32.265 --> 23:35.728
Well, you know, I think it will be, first of all,

23:36.620 --> 23:53.246
people who are interested in the Bible and who are always looking for new approaches and new ways to study the text, but also intelligent adult readers who haven't looked at the Bible since they were 8 or 10 or 12 and are curious and might be surprised at what they find.

23:55.309 --> 24:03.201
There are probably millions of people in this country whose image of the Bible is really one form when they were children, although the Bible has

24:04.210 --> 24:06.815
wonderful stories that children can appreciate.

24:07.036 --> 24:08.298
It's not a book for kids.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.983
It's not a book of Bible stories.

24:11.063 --> 24:13.148
It's very much more than that.

24:13.168 --> 24:16.274
You mean the Bible in general is not a book for kids?

24:16.474 --> 24:18.899
Right.

24:18.959 --> 24:23.648
There are adult issues, and the answers are not always easy.

24:23.668 --> 24:25.071
It's not a book for kids, though.

24:25.355 --> 24:26.817
want to run with that for a little bit?

24:26.837 --> 24:29.080
I mean, because they start teaching kids the Bible.

24:29.100 --> 24:29.380
They do.

24:29.440 --> 24:34.046
Well, there are wonderful stories there which actually appeal to children very much.

24:34.447 --> 24:36.950
And so from that point of view, Bible stories are very useful.

24:39.774 --> 24:51.169
But some of the themes and issues in the text are issues that adults run into, issues of conflict and exile and tragedy and so on.

24:51.189 --> 24:54.113
You know, although we experience these things as kids also,

24:54.987 --> 25:05.980
It's very sophisticated and very complex and takes real effort, which people don't always have in our society.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.223
People don't read books in our society slowly.

25:10.585 --> 25:22.058
You buy a novel to read on vacation, but to sit with a page and go through line by line and really think about why is it saying it the way it's saying it?

25:22.325 --> 25:25.370
You wonder, will there be a paperback edition?

25:25.410 --> 25:28.075
Well, there'll be a somewhat cheaper edition, I think, in a year.

25:28.496 --> 25:30.299
I don't know if I should be quoted on that.

25:30.319 --> 25:38.593
They're certainly talking about a less expensive edition that will be more easily ordered for schools.

25:38.693 --> 25:43.160
I suspect the gold will go.

25:43.181 --> 25:45.244
They'll keep that as a gift edition.

25:45.629 --> 25:47.832
I do have the New York Times piece.

25:47.872 --> 25:59.208
Are there any other pieces I should be able... Are there any interviews that might be helpful to you that might do some biographical, actual stuff that I don't... Well, there was a good NPR piece, but that was recorded.

26:02.232 --> 26:10.984
There was a piece in the foreword that he was picked in New York fairly recently.

26:11.024 --> 26:12.025
That was...

26:14.738 --> 26:16.921
I think around Christmas time.

26:18.422 --> 26:21.666
They did a pretty involved piece.

26:21.686 --> 26:22.687
It's called The Forward.

26:22.707 --> 26:23.669
The Forward, yeah.

26:24.930 --> 26:27.513
It used to be used paper, now it's also in this version.

26:27.533 --> 26:30.517
So it's a good paper.

26:30.577 --> 26:36.624
I own the book itself, so obviously, and I don't have to take up too much of your time.

26:37.585 --> 26:41.470
And I know where to get you if I have any more questions asked to.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.412
So why don't we just do it?
