WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:03.406
upstairs with your friends.

00:03.506 --> 00:04.948
That's not available for conversation.

00:05.028 --> 00:07.092
I would be upstairs with Susanna.

00:07.112 --> 00:07.793
She'd be asleep.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.698
But you can see what page I'm on.

00:10.738 --> 00:17.088
I mean, I've read the various introductions, but I'm on page four.

00:18.410 --> 00:22.697
You're using an oak leaf, I think, for a book plan.

00:22.838 --> 00:27.666
Can you tell us a little bit about the passion for exploration in the Arctic?

00:28.487 --> 00:28.587
Well,

00:29.461 --> 00:36.530
I can't say why exactly, but I've always been interested in things northern and then Arctic and then Antarctic.

00:37.191 --> 00:44.600
I'm interested in exploration and have always been interested in the outdoors and wilderness stuff.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.744
I was a mountaineering instructor for a time after college.

00:47.784 --> 00:50.368
That was my first job as a mountaineering instructor in Wyoming.

00:52.751 --> 00:58.658
My brother still lives in Wyoming and teaches kayaking and natural history.

00:58.975 --> 00:59.877
various other things.

01:01.500 --> 01:08.112
But I think from an early age, I was very interested in C.S.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.594
Lewis, and I shared C.S.

01:09.635 --> 01:11.338
Lewis's interest in northerness.

01:11.939 --> 01:20.815
And then later on, I became interested simultaneously, I would say, in the literature of polar exploration.

01:21.132 --> 01:24.778
and in the literature of mountaineering, which is what I was actually doing.

01:24.838 --> 01:30.066
So I was also very interested in reading mountaineering classics like Annapurna and so on, which I read in college.

01:30.727 --> 01:41.343
But the notion of going as far as one could go, whether it's as high as one could go or as far north or south as one could go, has always interested me.

01:41.363 --> 01:44.608
I'm interested in

01:45.027 --> 01:54.275
the topography and the natural history of the Arctic more, but I'm interested in the personalities of the Antarctic explorers more.

01:54.295 --> 02:02.682
And I think that the Antarctic explorers particularly interest me because the most interesting ones were failures.

02:03.403 --> 02:06.225
And I think failure is usually more interesting than success.

02:06.845 --> 02:07.166
Yeah.

02:07.666 --> 02:14.612
So I find that Scott is more interesting to me than Amundsen.

02:15.233 --> 02:22.844
And Shackleton, Shackleton's most heroic expedition, it's great.

02:23.085 --> 02:29.915
His plan was to do a transit of the entire continent of Antarctica, and he never got to Antarctica.

02:30.556 --> 02:38.608
What happened was that his ship was frozen in for the winter, and so they overwintered in the ship.

02:39.247 --> 02:58.615
the ice that it was caught between cracked the ship and they had to leave the ship and then he, some of them ended up on sort of one little shore and then in a tiny boat, an open boat, he traveled over about a thousand miles to Elephant Island with some of his men and got, anyway, it was a very heroic tale.

02:58.655 --> 03:01.740
Everybody thought he was a great hero, but he never actually got to Antarctica.

03:01.760 --> 03:06.186
I mean, the entire expedition, he never even reached the place that he was supposed to cross the entirety of.

03:06.226 --> 03:07.448
The, um,

03:07.698 --> 03:11.282
Humor of this somehow I don't think is apparent to others.

03:11.402 --> 03:16.227
I think it's just hilarious, but I think it's also wonderful because what he did actually was much more heroic.

03:16.728 --> 03:18.249
He didn't lose a single man.

03:18.290 --> 03:29.602
This was the trip that was written about in the famous boy's story Endurance by Lansing, which I read as a teenager.

03:29.662 --> 03:34.347
And the whole notion of the heroism of failure, I think,

03:34.597 --> 03:41.488
bound me to these guys also, because the great periods of exploration were Victorian and Edwardian.

03:42.229 --> 03:49.020
In college, I studied Victorian history and literature.

03:49.060 --> 03:56.171
That was my field of concentration, so I was particularly interested in British exploration.

03:56.191 --> 04:00.418
I felt that the kinds of things that I was reading about in college

04:00.989 --> 04:18.291
The sorts of intellectual history that I was reading about and the kind of sensibility that comes out also in Victorian novels was being enacted in real life in some very interesting ways by the explorers who were either exploring right then or just after.

04:18.351 --> 04:25.039
Of course, Scott was post-Victorian but was bringing every Victorian

04:25.643 --> 04:30.669
point of view, and also even his books that he's brought.

04:30.949 --> 04:33.792
I love that, by the way.

04:34.013 --> 04:36.115
You have stuff in here of books.

04:36.295 --> 04:36.996
I'm very interested.

04:37.036 --> 04:39.679
I'd love to talk to that woman who was up in space.

04:39.719 --> 04:40.100
Remember her?

04:40.640 --> 04:41.481
And she said she read.

04:41.581 --> 04:42.342
I'd love to know what books.

04:42.362 --> 04:43.303
Oh, what did she bring?

04:43.464 --> 04:45.246
It's sort of like Desert Island reading.

04:45.266 --> 04:46.848
There's a book by Carrie Waite.

04:47.128 --> 04:47.909
Did you read it?

04:47.929 --> 04:48.550
I haven't read it.

04:48.690 --> 04:50.672
I haven't read it either.

04:50.922 --> 04:52.365
What did he read?

04:52.845 --> 04:54.047
Well, they didn't give him anything.

04:54.108 --> 04:59.016
Finally, they give him something like a textbook, you know, totally the most boring book.

04:59.217 --> 04:59.958
He devoured it.

04:59.978 --> 05:00.799
Oh, yeah.

05:00.819 --> 05:02.783
It just became the most important thing.

05:04.326 --> 05:05.528
Let's talk a little bit about this.

05:05.548 --> 05:06.109
Sure.

05:06.129 --> 05:15.445
I did a Nexus search, and by the way, I found tons of all of your Life magazine pieces are in there, which is, you know, I was looking at some of them, and then, of course, there was some

05:15.678 --> 05:23.148
interest in your appointment, especially in the person you succeeded.

05:23.569 --> 05:28.896
You might talk a little bit about the American Scholar, what it represents and what you'd like to see.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.899
Sure, let me get some ice water.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.421
That'd be great, actually.

05:32.922 --> 05:40.032
The Scholar is now my passion, my obsession.

05:42.695 --> 05:53.748
Having done a couple of books, the obvious thing would be for anyone who had a book or to write more reportorial articles like the ones I did for life.

05:53.768 --> 06:02.418
And I think people who are my age tend to get into ultra-safe grooves.

06:02.578 --> 06:06.022
They tend to keep on doing the things that they know they do well.

06:07.564 --> 06:11.689
Often they're in financial positions that make it impossible for them to take risks.

06:12.007 --> 06:15.591
Their children are in age and they need to start saving that money for college.

06:16.312 --> 06:24.562
I mean, we are also at that point financially, so it is hard to take a risk.

06:24.622 --> 06:39.280
But I felt that as I looked around at my friends and saw many of them just very deeply grooved in their lives, I think what I had learned from doing my first book was how important it is to...

06:40.795 --> 06:43.219
try new things, get out of the groove.

06:44.280 --> 06:57.882
And I felt that it would be very exciting to do something of which I might fall flat on my face, that that would be by far the most exciting thing I could possibly do in my mid-forties, is to take that kind of risk.

06:58.362 --> 07:03.691
So when the opportunity to be... I mean, I was contacted by the search committee at The Scholar.

07:04.151 --> 07:08.338
At that point, I had no idea...

07:08.588 --> 07:16.339
that Joseph Epstein, that was the first, when I got that call, was the first I heard that Joseph Epstein was leaving, let alone that he had been fired.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.723
And that came as complete news to me.

07:19.264 --> 07:28.998
But when I was contacted by the search committee, the more I thought about it, the more I felt that I might make a complete idiot of myself in front of, you know, really in public.

07:29.078 --> 07:34.687
If you write a book and it's a failure, unless you're already famous, it simply doesn't get reviewed.

07:34.767 --> 07:34.967
And

07:35.183 --> 07:39.369
You say you've wasted your time, but it's not exactly... You quietly disappear.

07:39.389 --> 07:43.956
You quietly disappear, whereas standing with a scholar would be incredibly public.

07:45.217 --> 07:47.381
So it was a huge... Especially following Epstein, too.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.183
Especially following Mr. Epstein.

07:51.867 --> 08:03.604
But I felt that it was the one thing I could do that would be the biggest risk and the biggest change that I could possibly make in my life at this point.

08:04.006 --> 08:11.893
It would also be associating myself with what I think is one of the greatest journals in the country.

08:11.913 --> 08:15.096
I felt like I couldn't say no.

08:15.216 --> 08:19.540
It was just so exciting, although also very scary.

08:20.121 --> 08:25.626
Mr. Epstein, I thought, had done a really wonderful job with the scholar.

08:25.926 --> 08:33.253
There are certainly plenty of things we disagree about, but most of the things that we disagree about were not actually things that had anything to do with the scholar,

08:33.571 --> 08:38.636
His own column in The Scholar was completely nonpolitical and just wonderful.

08:38.656 --> 08:40.057
He's such a great essayist.

08:40.417 --> 08:48.064
He's a very good editor, too, and an extremely nice man who has been incredibly helpful to me.

08:48.885 --> 09:01.857
Although I think he was very angry at Phi Beta Kappa for dismissing him, he...

09:02.056 --> 09:19.563
is large-spirited enough to know that my being chosen for editor had nothing to do with his being dismissed and that first he was dismissed and then the search committee went through an incredibly long process that ended up with me.

09:19.963 --> 09:27.595
He's never taken out his anger at Phi Beta Kappa on me and has been nothing... That's a very classy... He's a real gentleman, real gentleman.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.139
Did they indicate to you

09:30.406 --> 09:36.415
that they'd like a new direction or that maybe just a new blood was in order at this particular point?

09:37.617 --> 09:47.891
I think that they wanted to be sure that the new editor was going to be somebody who would not bring a particular political view into the magazine.

09:47.932 --> 09:59.248
I think that it was felt that Mr. Epstein, over the years, had become more conservative and that in his choice of articles, his choice of articles sometimes reflected that.

09:59.498 --> 10:14.175
I didn't have that feeling as strongly as Phi Beta Kappa did, because I felt that... I mean, it's true that there were very few left-wing articles in the scholar, but there weren't very many right-wing ones either, because most of the scholar was apolitical.

10:14.575 --> 10:16.357
I would say 90% was apolitical.

10:16.677 --> 10:25.347
And it's true that that 10% tended to be more right than left, but I felt that they were looking only at what was such a small fraction of what was in the scholar.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.750
And I'm not interested in making the scholar political at all,

10:28.152 --> 10:39.305
But I think there was a strong feeling that they wished, as an editor who wouldn't bring politics into the magazine, but again, I want to say that I didn't really think that the press I did very much either.

10:41.327 --> 10:55.763
I think that there was a feeling perhaps of wanting someone younger, although I know that many of the people they considered for the job were older than I. I think I was perhaps the youngest of the short list.

10:56.063 --> 11:00.148
So I don't think that age or gender was particularly important to them.

11:00.168 --> 11:04.192
I mean, I know the other people that I heard afterwards, the other people that they had considered.

11:04.373 --> 11:08.978
And some were academics, some were journalists, some were old, some were young, some were women, some were men.

11:09.038 --> 11:13.583
I mean, it was a very interesting and heterogeneous list.

11:13.603 --> 11:16.827
And why they finally settled on me, who knows.

11:16.947 --> 11:22.273
But it is the controversy...

11:23.097 --> 11:35.816
that was swirling around the time of my appointment, fortunately has died down because it was really a controversy about my predecessor's dismissal rather than about my appointment.

11:36.117 --> 11:44.249
That is, anyone who wasn't Mr. Epstein would have been considered a scoundrel by definition by many of his supporters, though certainly not by him.

11:45.271 --> 11:51.180
However, the same people, the same publications that threw up their hands when he was dismissed,

11:51.481 --> 11:56.066
haven't written anything mean since my first two issues have come out.

11:56.667 --> 12:11.305
And in fact, there have been some quite conservative people who were great friends of Mr. Epstein's who liked the scholar very much and who feel it's absolutely possible to like the old scholar and the new scholar.

12:11.825 --> 12:13.527
Are these all your science stories?

12:13.828 --> 12:14.649
Well, let's see.

12:14.769 --> 12:16.611
In this issue,

12:17.266 --> 12:21.592
There are two pieces in this issue that were assigned by Mr. Epstein.

12:22.133 --> 12:31.626
I decided after my experience at The New Yorker that I would eventually print everything that Mr. Epstein had accepted or wasn't able to run.

12:31.786 --> 12:32.907
He didn't ask me.

12:33.408 --> 12:36.633
It's nice to him, and it's also very nice to the writers, too.

12:36.773 --> 12:39.997
Some of them may have to wait a while since we've come out only four times a year.

12:40.117 --> 12:46.446
But there are two good pieces in this issue that Mr. Epstein had assigned.

12:46.578 --> 12:51.483
The David Canadine piece on John Buchan and Voices of Science by David Locke.

12:52.404 --> 12:57.050
The other ones I either assigned or came in to me.

12:57.070 --> 13:01.455
In some cases, people will call me up.

13:01.495 --> 13:11.326
Catherine Stimson, who used to be the head of the MacArthur Fellows and is now the dean of the graduate school at NYU, called me and said that she was thinking of writing.

13:11.526 --> 13:15.370
I guess that she had written the first draft of an essay about...

13:15.637 --> 13:17.740
being mugged and did I want to see it.

13:18.480 --> 13:27.071
Hortense Kalischer wrote me a letter after she read about me in the New York Times and said she thought it sounded as if I was doing interesting things with a scholar.

13:27.651 --> 13:30.234
Well, that turned around pretty quickly then.

13:30.254 --> 13:32.297
That story wasn't that long ago in the Times.

13:32.317 --> 13:32.597
Right.

13:32.858 --> 13:33.358
That's right.

13:34.399 --> 13:40.787
And Vermeer is someone whose work I read and liked very much, and I called him up.

13:40.827 --> 13:42.049
He's a oncologist.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.450
He's blind.

13:43.570 --> 13:44.952
He wrote a lovely piece about

13:45.151 --> 13:48.435
exploring a tide pool with senses other than sight.

13:49.636 --> 14:00.589
Brian Doyle is someone who had written for The Scholar before, a writer that I particularly like and that I had called up and particularly encouraged to write something else.

14:00.830 --> 14:04.394
And he came up with this absolutely wonderful piece about being a camp counselor.

14:05.495 --> 14:13.605
So the subjects in terms of brow height really are quite varied from everything from being a camp counselor

14:13.754 --> 14:19.441
to actually the most erudite piece in here by Adam Kirsch.

14:19.962 --> 14:23.186
He wrote it when he was 21 years old, and that's when he came in over the transom.

14:23.707 --> 14:24.869
He's absolutely brilliant.

14:25.169 --> 14:27.692
So do you have an idea of what you're looking for?

14:27.953 --> 14:29.535
Yes, I do.

14:29.815 --> 14:31.277
And by the way, I am Philo Noe.

14:31.878 --> 14:35.603
So this is, I have this column that I write.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.185
And did you identify them?

14:37.205 --> 14:37.966
Yes.

14:38.406 --> 14:41.230
Well, she's actually identified, you can sort of read this whole...

14:41.412 --> 14:43.335
Here's a letter here.

14:43.375 --> 14:47.261
Do we know that she is you?

14:48.403 --> 14:55.373
I think that it's one of those things that I will never state, but that is sort of common knowledge in the way everyone knew Joseph Edson was our studies.

14:57.456 --> 15:07.892
Here is, I think that one maintains the fiction that she's an unknown person, but I think that in the world of Germany, it's P-H-I-L-O

15:08.227 --> 15:24.789
N-O-E, with a diuresis, over the E. And Philonoë means a lover of things of the mind, a lover of knowledge.

15:25.791 --> 15:30.657
I thought it was a good name because as an

15:30.890 --> 15:36.155
As an essayist and an editor, it's not claiming that I'm actually knowledgeable, just that I love knowledge.

15:36.815 --> 15:37.096
That's great.

15:37.156 --> 15:37.937
How did you find that?

15:37.957 --> 15:41.140
Well, she's a minor character.

15:41.200 --> 15:46.384
She's the daughter of the King of Sparta and didn't do anything particularly interesting in her life.

15:46.484 --> 15:49.647
I had a lot of people looking around for me.

15:49.667 --> 15:52.790
It was actually a name that my brother found for me.

15:53.431 --> 15:58.956
He was reading through various... I thought it would be nice to continue the tradition of the classical...

15:59.560 --> 16:03.786
But she was chosen entirely for the meaning of her name.

16:05.489 --> 16:11.057
You asked what I wanted the scholar to do.

16:12.138 --> 16:18.528
Let me first say that the American scholar is in some way a misnomer.

16:18.588 --> 16:25.138
The first time I met him, he endeared himself to me forever by saying this.

16:25.178 --> 16:26.800
He said, you know, that damn name.

16:27.421 --> 16:31.308
I've been dealing with it for 23 years, and now you have to deal with it.

16:31.689 --> 16:37.600
And what he meant was that it made people think that this magazine was much more scholarly than it really is.

16:37.661 --> 16:40.185
It's not a magazine by or for scholars.

16:40.286 --> 16:43.993
As I said, only 15% of our subscribers are academics.

16:44.474 --> 16:50.425
The title comes from an 1837 speech by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

16:50.945 --> 16:55.332
which was actually quite famously anti-intellectual.

16:55.712 --> 17:12.999
It was called The American Scholar, and it was exhorting his listeners to break away from the dry, dusty libraries of Europe and establish an American intellectual tradition that was much more vigorous and based on experience rather than just reading.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.564
This is the famous quote from it that I decided to use about it.

17:16.713 --> 17:22.343
So you have had some very subtle little changes.

17:22.483 --> 17:24.867
Oh, and it's completely redesigned, looks totally different.

17:25.809 --> 17:26.470
It's quite different.

17:26.490 --> 17:27.432
It has all new departments.

17:27.532 --> 17:34.284
If you look at the old scholar and the new scholar, it's, I think, very much in the same tradition, at least I hope, but with very substantial changes.

17:34.364 --> 17:35.326
All the departments are new.

17:36.829 --> 17:41.657
The redesign is new.

17:43.004 --> 17:46.488
In any case, it is not a magazine for scholars.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.951
It is a magazine for people who like good essays.

17:48.971 --> 17:52.775
And if there's one word I hope people will associate with a scholar, it's essays.

17:54.197 --> 17:55.919
The essays are on all kinds of things.

17:57.261 --> 18:02.767
My essays, my first one was on collecting nature.

18:02.807 --> 18:06.411
It's about how I collected butterflies and shells as a kid.

18:07.232 --> 18:09.034
This one is about Charles Lamb.

18:10.676 --> 18:11.357
In our first...

18:11.759 --> 18:12.260
issue.

18:13.742 --> 18:40.483
We had everything from Alfred Kazin writing about visiting the Met for the first time at the age of 11, which had been 71 years before he wrote the essay, to an essay on the essay by Ved Meda, and then our most unusual subject, a wonderful essay by Jonathan Rosen on the Talmud and the Internet, on the parallels in structure between the two, sort of non-linear nature of the two.

18:40.868 --> 18:44.052
It was also about his grandmother's death and everything else in the universe.

18:44.613 --> 18:49.019
And the point being that the Talmud and the Internet had probably never been mentioned in the same sentence before.

18:49.059 --> 18:55.788
And this marriage, which I hope was not a shotgun marriage, was consummated in the pages of The Scholar.

18:56.549 --> 19:05.762
One of the things that is kind of emblematic of The Scholar in this issue, I wrote my editor's letter here about...

19:06.518 --> 19:13.085
The fact that just by coincidence, there are two pieces in this issue that are written by two Harvard graduates exactly 70 years apart.

19:13.465 --> 19:15.667
One is a class of 27 and one is a class of 97.

19:16.468 --> 19:27.559
And in fact, when then I looked at the other, I didn't put this in the editor's note, but when I just looked at who else I had in the issue, we had one contributor therefore in his 20s and one in his 90s.

19:27.579 --> 19:33.445
And there were also contributors, at least one, in his or her 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s.

19:33.846 --> 19:35.968
And so in terms of age, it's...

19:36.353 --> 19:37.454
It covers the waterfront.

19:37.955 --> 19:39.898
But look at the stature of it, right?

19:39.998 --> 19:41.800
Well, it's pretty impressive.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.182
It's pretty, yeah.

19:43.202 --> 19:46.867
And in the next issue, we have the lead pieces by Cynthia Ozick.

19:47.307 --> 19:54.197
And then there's a long piece for serial rights from Peter Gay's new memoir about growing up in Nazi Berlin.

19:54.237 --> 19:58.803
There's an excerpt from Phyllis Rose's journal.

19:59.584 --> 20:00.305
It's amazing.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.107
Who's willing to write for us for hardly any money?

20:03.008 --> 20:04.831
What's the circulation?

20:05.051 --> 20:05.972
$25,000.

20:06.458 --> 20:09.422
How much of that would you say is university libraries?

20:09.722 --> 20:10.704
Oh, a tiny fraction.

20:10.764 --> 20:12.406
That's good, you know, because they're disappearing.

20:12.526 --> 20:17.092
The journal is... I'll have the numbers on that in my new book.

20:17.112 --> 20:24.381
But the journal is really a thing of the past now in terms of being purchased by universities.

20:24.461 --> 20:27.265
The budget... And that's really sad.

20:27.566 --> 20:33.293
And it really will affect... I mean, so many of your journals will...

20:33.948 --> 20:37.952
in the very near future be published on the Internet.

20:38.513 --> 20:42.076
Yeah, well... Certainly that's not going to be the case with this, I imagine.

20:42.236 --> 20:51.426
No, we are developing a little website, but I'm not very interested in it yet because I am interested in holding the physical book.

20:51.446 --> 20:56.771
As you know from my book, for me, there's something extremely important about the physical book.

20:57.392 --> 20:58.453
And I don't mean...

20:59.412 --> 21:00.653
the rarity of a book.

21:00.753 --> 21:07.441
I don't think that carnal lovers like very rare books, because then they feel that they can't be carnal.

21:07.921 --> 21:10.284
With a rare book, you have to be a platonic lover.

21:12.086 --> 21:20.114
With a rare book, you can't dog-ear the pages, and you can't write in them, and you can't put an ugly hand to keep the page.

21:21.376 --> 21:29.284
But with a book that's not particularly rare and not particularly valuable,

21:29.905 --> 21:33.609
you can do whatever you want.

21:34.810 --> 21:54.111
But I do believe that there is something about being able to curl up in bed with a book, about being able to hold it and maybe scrawl in it, and maybe, in my daughter's case, not only read the same titles, but the actual books that her father read at the same age.

21:54.692 --> 21:59.237
It's really quite moving to see her pick up a Thornton Burgess book that...

21:59.437 --> 22:15.286
my husband read when he was a boy, and that one of his grandparents also read as a child, and think it's not only a title, that that grandparent turned the actual page.

22:15.366 --> 22:16.849
Did you see Berita's journal?

22:17.650 --> 22:18.171
Did you ever?

22:18.623 --> 22:20.245
I haven't done it since the seventh grade.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.668
But you did it, though.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.671
I've never done it.

22:24.751 --> 22:25.492
It's not a journal.

22:25.552 --> 22:29.397
I used to keep a list of titles of books when I was in the seventh and eighth grade.

22:29.797 --> 22:32.381
But I read so many books then that it was hard to keep up.

22:32.401 --> 22:33.262
It used to be a hundred.

22:34.143 --> 22:37.107
No, I don't.

22:37.768 --> 22:48.141
Part of it is that having two small children and working full-time, there just isn't time to do the things that I've... It would be fun to do so.

22:48.458 --> 22:57.769
But sometimes I'll write little notes in the back of a book, especially if it's something that I think I might want to write about someday, or I'll turn down pages.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.152
Sometimes I'll Xerox things.

23:00.192 --> 23:04.998
My commonplace book has degenerated just to a folder of Xerox pages.

23:05.058 --> 23:10.585
I have a Xerox machine at home, and things I think I might want to write about someday or that I would like to keep go in there.

23:11.786 --> 23:18.094
There's this physician, and his name escapes me because he won a Nobel Prize, and he lives outside of Boston for a while.

23:19.036 --> 23:21.179
his project.

23:21.219 --> 23:23.944
He didn't win the Nobel Prize for his writing, but for his projects.

23:23.964 --> 23:27.389
But he did write a book, Hoden Mifflin published it, did an interview with him.

23:28.270 --> 23:29.272
Fascinating guy.

23:29.292 --> 23:30.774
His name is escaping me right now.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.899
But he put together a database.

23:37.425 --> 23:44.115
Very high percentage, although I do have, I guess about a thousand books.

23:44.483 --> 23:45.184
Maybe it's less.

23:45.384 --> 23:45.965
That's not much.

23:46.245 --> 23:48.087
No, no, no, no.

23:48.147 --> 23:50.350
We have about 4,000 or 4,500.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.353
I was very surprised.

23:53.413 --> 23:54.335
It's about 4,500.

23:54.395 --> 24:00.141
No, but just to complete this, it's about 1,000 books, maybe a little less, came from my father.

24:00.161 --> 24:06.989
I probably have read a smaller fraction of those because they entered my life relatively recently.

24:07.290 --> 24:10.153
The other books entered one by one.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.402
No, I think it's about 4,500.

24:12.542 --> 24:15.024
We may be creeping up a little over 5,000 now.

24:15.044 --> 24:16.906
But you live in the city, right?

24:16.926 --> 24:22.231
Yeah, we live in a loft, an old box factory with floor-to-ceiling bookcases that are totally overflowing.

24:23.933 --> 24:35.464
We don't follow the policy that a friend of mine follows that his wife finally, it's sort of like the whole notion of the canon, she finally said when you get a new book you have to get rid of an old one.

24:36.024 --> 24:38.807
And we're not quite at that point, but if we get

24:39.260 --> 24:41.302
Two new books will get rid of one.

24:41.803 --> 24:45.726
One of the big jokes in my house is reading time.

24:45.987 --> 24:50.131
When we're getting rid of books, and I've got thousands of books.

24:50.291 --> 24:55.877
Obviously you get review books, and I buy books, and they are really all over the place.

24:56.437 --> 24:57.338
How many do you have?

24:57.859 --> 24:58.719
More than 10,000?

24:58.799 --> 24:59.520
Oh, more than 10,000.

24:59.560 --> 25:04.745
There must be at least 2,500 children's books, but we love children's books.

25:04.765 --> 25:08.389
I review children's books, and I've got a couple of miscreepers.

25:08.858 --> 25:12.383
I do eight children's books a month in one.

25:12.483 --> 25:12.823
I love it.

25:13.164 --> 25:17.269
I would even like to write a couple of children's books.

25:17.289 --> 25:17.690
Why not?

25:17.830 --> 25:18.992
Put your money where your mouth is.

25:20.734 --> 25:28.845
There's a woman in Boston, a physician, who's also a children's book writer and is also a pediatric doctor.

25:28.865 --> 25:34.313
Did you see that story in the New York Times where they're actually prescribing books as part of... No.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.795
Oh, interesting.

25:35.815 --> 25:36.756
When did that run?

25:36.989 --> 25:38.693
I'll have to get it for you.

25:38.874 --> 25:40.739
I have the article.

25:41.079 --> 25:44.548
That brings together two of my main interests, medicine and books.

25:44.568 --> 25:45.912
For inner-city kids, too.

25:46.173 --> 25:49.080
So they come in and instead of giving them a lollipop, they'll give them a book.

25:49.922 --> 25:50.423
That's great.

25:50.444 --> 25:51.426
I've got to write about this.

25:51.927 --> 25:52.990
This looks pretty good.

25:53.948 --> 25:55.149
What was I talking about?

25:55.610 --> 25:59.054
About the number of books that you have.

25:59.854 --> 26:01.616
You have a lot of books.

26:01.656 --> 26:02.838
Anyway, you have a lot.

26:02.858 --> 26:06.522
There's no way I've read every book or ever will.

26:07.202 --> 26:07.883
Weeding, yeah.

26:08.043 --> 26:09.184
Weeding.

26:09.204 --> 26:11.107
So every once in a while, I've got to get rid of these books.

26:11.427 --> 26:17.754
I'm a past president of the Friends of the Garden Library, so I'll give them 200 books for their sale.

26:18.374 --> 26:22.639
Review books, I can give them, and they can sell them, and they can get rid of the trash, too.

26:23.328 --> 26:28.933
But the weeding process, I have actually taken a look and have gone back, become panic-stricken.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.529
and to go back and brought them back.

26:31.669 --> 26:40.957
Oh, there's that wonderful story in your book about the Frenchman who, oh, that one was just so poignant.

26:41.017 --> 26:44.520
I always wanted to put that in one of my essays.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.221
The journalist found that story.

26:46.241 --> 26:47.683
Oh, it's a wonderful story.

26:47.703 --> 26:50.345
It's the most poignant book story I have ever heard.

26:50.385 --> 26:55.029
I found that in an article on the wholesale in one of the old New York papers.

26:56.230 --> 26:58.352
It's supposed to reverse itself.

26:58.432 --> 26:58.752
I thought you'd

26:58.968 --> 27:00.291
No, no, no.

27:00.872 --> 27:01.614
This is wonderful.

27:01.654 --> 27:02.336
This goes an hour.

27:02.456 --> 27:03.799
Boy, that's a great tape.

27:03.839 --> 27:10.815
It only takes one AAA, and it goes automatically in the other direction, so you get two hours out of it.

27:10.835 --> 27:11.396
Oh, that's great.

27:11.416 --> 27:13.120
And the quality of the tape is pretty good?

27:13.140 --> 27:13.682
It's the best.

27:14.102 --> 27:14.624
Oh, that's great.

27:14.644 --> 27:15.746
But you don't listen to it out of this.

27:15.766 --> 27:16.227
You put it in.

27:16.267 --> 27:17.871
Right, right.

27:18.391 --> 27:22.615
But the fidelity of the... You've got it transcribed with a foot pedal and that.

27:22.735 --> 27:23.015
Yeah.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.376
God, I hate transcription.

27:24.496 --> 27:25.737
I despise it.

27:25.757 --> 27:28.720
For the new book, easily, I'm 60 tapes behind.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.302
And I'll never catch up.

27:31.322 --> 27:32.023
I just hate it.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.064
I shouldn't say so much.

27:34.144 --> 27:37.587
I keep thinking, oh, you're going to have to transcribe it.

27:37.687 --> 27:38.648
I have my sympathy.

27:38.928 --> 27:40.390
This stuff here, you go fast.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.072
And we've got tons of stuff, by the way.

27:43.092 --> 27:45.574
I'm just so thoroughly... See if there's anything else that you have.

27:46.215 --> 27:47.976
My family still isn't back, so we can...

27:48.631 --> 27:50.834
I love the story on your father.

27:50.854 --> 27:57.763
I mean, not when he lost his sight, of course, but that Milton sonnet.

27:57.783 --> 28:06.135
And Errath Ostenes, who could no longer read because they didn't have classes, the first or second librarian, and he starved himself to death.

28:08.277 --> 28:10.741
I wondered where we were going with that.

28:10.781 --> 28:16.208
And the example of Milton, of course, is beautiful.

28:16.390 --> 28:19.797
But that you read it to him on the phone is very touching.

28:19.977 --> 28:27.893
Well, I knew that night in the hospital when we, it was the first thing that he'd gotten interested in, reconstructing that sauna.

28:28.674 --> 28:34.305
And his curiosity, I know he knew he wasn't going to die until at least he had heard me read the saunas on the phone.

28:34.365 --> 28:38.854
That sense of intellectual curiosity still being alive made me feel maybe this will be okay.

28:39.307 --> 28:43.732
And indeed, he has reconstructed his life in the most amazing way.

28:43.752 --> 28:47.036
And can you briefly tell me how he's doing now and what he's doing now?

28:47.096 --> 28:47.897
He's doing fine.

28:48.117 --> 28:48.277
He's 94.

28:48.938 --> 28:51.821
I have an 87-year-old father.

28:51.881 --> 28:57.948
My father at 94 physically is really doing quite incredibly except for his sight.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.791
That is, he doesn't even use a cane to walk.

29:01.031 --> 29:04.775
I mean, not only for being blind, but just for sort of... Getting around.

29:04.855 --> 29:05.156
Yeah.

29:05.176 --> 29:07.238
I mean, not that he goes for long hikes, but he can...

29:07.437 --> 29:09.019
easily get into a restaurant.

29:09.039 --> 29:10.660
He lives a very normal life with my mother.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.402
They go out to dinner several times a week.

29:12.922 --> 29:15.785
He still works for the Book of the Month Club.

29:16.266 --> 29:19.449
He's worked for them for about 60 years, in addition to doing many other things.

29:19.629 --> 29:21.290
They record manuscripts for him.

29:21.310 --> 29:25.334
They're on tape.

29:28.297 --> 29:29.418
Oh, thank you.

29:31.220 --> 29:35.424
By the way, let me just explain, and I'll get back to my father.

29:35.464 --> 29:37.326
This is the same

29:37.863 --> 30:05.811
uh and but ex libris is now part of the book plate i said i wanted it to be on the book plate because of course ex libris and it goes on the book plate so i said it should be on a book plate and then confessions of a common reader sort of across in a stripe and then this is just plain green and not quite so poisonous as this shade and then this these little things with this sort of weird giraffe reticulation which i don't particularly like but these are from an old sears catalog so

30:06.078 --> 30:09.281
It's like the Sears catalog that I referred to in my catalog.

30:09.301 --> 30:10.383
Those are now the end papers.

30:10.963 --> 30:12.124
All right, now.

30:13.866 --> 30:15.548
That's great.

30:15.788 --> 30:19.693
And if you would kindly just indicate on the cape or something like that.

30:19.713 --> 30:19.833
Okay.

30:19.853 --> 30:20.333
And the date.

30:23.497 --> 30:28.502
You have John Dunning, an ad for John Dunning's book of the Pack of the American Scholar there.

30:28.662 --> 30:29.803
What's the book?

30:29.843 --> 30:31.906
The book on radio, the history of radio.

30:31.926 --> 30:33.267
It's an ad, I noticed.

30:34.090 --> 30:37.876
I was just supposed to see him, and I just got back from Colorado two nights ago.

30:38.296 --> 30:41.000
He wrote Book to Die and Bookman's Wake.

30:41.741 --> 30:42.883
Uh-huh.

30:42.983 --> 30:43.905
Have you ever read any of those?

30:43.925 --> 30:44.205
No, I haven't.

30:44.225 --> 30:44.826
Oh, they're wonderful.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.629
Oh, I should read them.

30:46.649 --> 30:47.650
How could I have missed them?

30:47.670 --> 30:48.331
Oh, they're mysteries.

30:48.431 --> 30:48.732
I see.

30:48.752 --> 30:49.753
Yeah, but they're terrific.

30:49.974 --> 30:50.634
Uh-huh.

30:50.655 --> 30:51.756
He's a terrific writer.

30:51.836 --> 30:55.722
He just happens also to have been a former Aquarium bookseller.

30:56.363 --> 30:57.164
But I just noticed.

30:57.204 --> 30:58.065
I was supposed to see him.

30:59.728 --> 31:00.469
Couldn't put it together.

31:00.820 --> 31:02.842
In fact, I wanted to do a Biblio piece on them.

31:03.082 --> 31:04.744
By the way, you mentioned the Strand earlier.

31:04.764 --> 31:06.345
My next feature is on the Strand.

31:06.405 --> 31:07.947
It's a profile on the Strand.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.128
And then you follow after that.

31:09.148 --> 31:10.389
I go there all the time.

31:10.409 --> 31:11.290
I love that place.

31:12.591 --> 31:13.372
It's dangerous.

31:13.733 --> 31:17.917
The bookstore is so cheap that you keep saying it's a bargain, but you're just going to spend it that much.

31:18.057 --> 31:20.439
I'm so happy he's got his daughter in there now.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.962
They're going to modernize it.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.044
They're going to put a new floor in.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.528
But they're bringing in this wonderful New York architect who

31:30.149 --> 31:33.495
who specializes in old buildings.

31:37.521 --> 31:45.515
The Parker pen was given to me.

31:45.535 --> 31:46.416
You told the story.

31:46.516 --> 31:46.777
Yes.

31:48.219 --> 31:49.582
But it's the Parker pen.

31:49.602 --> 31:51.685
I don't think it's actually in here because I think that the

31:52.340 --> 31:55.469
It was in my last Civilization column that wasn't included in here.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.759
A reader of my column sent me a pen.

31:59.100 --> 32:02.790
It's an old Parker pen that is of the same vintage.

32:03.352 --> 32:04.375
I think you mentioned that.

32:05.620 --> 32:08.043
There's a replacement.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.046
Well, I bought a replacement.

32:11.066 --> 32:13.109
It didn't work.

32:13.269 --> 32:16.193
It would make me sick to lose my pen.

32:16.433 --> 32:16.813
It was.

32:16.873 --> 32:17.674
It was so terrible.

32:17.694 --> 32:23.181
Now I have this other one that this really nice reader sent me that I wrote about in my last column.

32:23.221 --> 32:31.050
My last column was a letter to my readers, and so we decided not to include it in here.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.133
Do you need any more pictures or reading?

32:33.153 --> 32:33.433
Yeah, I do.
