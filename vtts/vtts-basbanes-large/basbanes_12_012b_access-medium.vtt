00:02.545 --> 00:09.915
on a mountaintop, above the top, which is very modern.

00:10.997 --> 00:19.469
The outer walls of the house are almost completely glass, completely window around the house.

00:20.050 --> 00:27.100
So it's hard to tell exactly where the inside ends and where the outside begins.

00:27.180 --> 00:31.506
It's really a love poem.

00:31.857 --> 00:46.992
Ending is a sense of trepidation that is not going to last, although this was written about 10 years after Elizabeth moved to Brazil.

00:51.476 --> 00:53.258
A song for the rainy season.

00:56.841 --> 01:00.565
Hidden, oh, hidden in the high fog

01:01.439 --> 01:25.051
the house we live in, beneath the magnetic rock, rain, rainbow-ridden, where blood-black bromelias, lichens, owls, and the lint of the waterfalls cling, familiar, unbidden.

01:25.071 --> 01:26.974
In a dim age of water,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.325
Brooke sings loud from a ribcage of giant fern.

01:33.586 --> 01:45.219
Vapor climbs up the thick growth effortlessly, turns back, holding them both, house and rock, in a private cloud.

01:47.442 --> 01:56.792
At night on the roof, blind drops crawl, and the ordinary brown owl gives us proof he can count.

01:57.835 --> 02:09.865
Five times, always five, he stands and takes off after the fat frogs that shrilling for love, clamber and mount.

02:12.107 --> 02:27.420
House, open house, to the white dew and the milk-white sunrise kind to the eyes, to membership of silverfish, mouse, bookworms,

02:27.687 --> 02:33.293
big moths with a wall for the mildew's ignorant map.

02:35.435 --> 02:46.207
Darkened and tarnished by the warm touch of the warm breath, maculate, cherished.

02:46.227 --> 02:54.235
Rejoice, for a later era will differ, oh difference that kills

02:59.210 --> 03:01.873
shadowy light.

03:01.893 --> 03:16.210
Without water, the great rock will stare, unmagnetized, bare, no longer wearing rainbows or rain, the forgiving air and the high fog gone.

03:17.672 --> 03:26.162
The owls will move on, and the several waterfalls shrivel in the steady sun.

03:31.795 --> 03:38.225
This letter Elizabeth wrote to Robert Lowell from Oro Preto.

03:40.228 --> 03:44.335
She had just won the National Book Award for her complete poems.

03:45.236 --> 03:58.056
Since there was no phone in her house, she had actually been in the post office trying to call Robert Giroux when his call came through telling her the news that she had won.

03:59.167 --> 04:05.516
She immediately called Robert Roll and asked him to accept the award for her.

04:06.337 --> 04:09.762
The letter is dated March 5, 1970.

04:10.503 --> 04:21.119
In September of that year, she'd be moving to Cambridge to teach at Harvard.

04:21.139 --> 04:23.883
I hope this reaches you before you take off for Italy.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.688
Such excitement here about the National Book Awards.

04:28.208 --> 04:31.172
It was rather nice.

04:31.192 --> 04:32.734
Many wires from Bob.

04:33.896 --> 04:36.800
All weirdly mid-fell by the time they got here.

04:38.002 --> 04:41.447
And then when I called him, we seemed to meet in mid-Atlantic.

04:42.007 --> 04:44.311
He was calling me at the very same minute.

04:46.033 --> 04:49.958
I really wanted to go to New York, but it would have been an awful rush.

04:50.559 --> 04:54.104
Barely 24 hours to get ready and get from here to Rio.

04:54.845 --> 04:56.848
No cold weather clothes at all.

04:57.335 --> 05:03.342
and then the expense, even if Farrar Strauss and Giroux pay the airplane ticket.

05:03.362 --> 05:06.025
But I would have loved seeing you and other friends.

05:07.287 --> 05:12.293
I have never attended one of those functions and can't imagine what they are like.

05:13.274 --> 05:19.181
I remember reading parts of the speech by Updike, however, and feared that a speech might be expected.

05:21.664 --> 05:25.468
I heard my cable, Bob's suggestion, reached you

05:25.752 --> 05:29.117
served the purpose and wasn't an awful nuisance to you.

05:30.358 --> 05:39.571
It seems to me you are always doing things for me that I should somehow be able to do for myself, and I am really profoundly grateful.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.076
I thought of several other cables.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.861
One was, about time.

05:50.887 --> 05:51.928
Not that I attended.

05:53.680 --> 05:59.429
It seemed like an occasion when one should be quite square, so I hope it was all right.

06:01.532 --> 06:06.140
My stop at the post office, telephone company, and I gather the U.S.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.584
Embassy here, has gone way up.

06:10.046 --> 06:16.236
How I would love to have heard the judges' conversation, Rex Roth and Eugene McCarthy especially.

06:17.898 --> 06:21.544
Well, I am sure I owe it all to you, and thank you.

06:21.878 --> 06:26.563
as well as for the holding hand at the announcement ceremony, if you were able to be there.

06:28.185 --> 06:32.089
These things make such a big impression on the ignorant.

06:32.149 --> 06:34.571
Like here, it is nice.

06:37.374 --> 06:42.239
Just made a birthday cake for the maid, who is 18 today, Eva.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.623
I've never known so many Adams and Eves.

06:46.263 --> 06:48.966
They seem to be the favorite names here.

06:49.908 --> 06:55.734
This girl and her younger sister have really made life much more bearable, clean and quiet.

06:56.474 --> 06:58.096
Now they'll only stay a while.

06:59.257 --> 07:06.905
The mother, they are two of 13, comes to the door every day or so, and they go through a little ritual.

07:07.906 --> 07:08.767
Bless me, mother.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.609
God bless you, my daughter.

07:11.629 --> 07:12.210
And so on.

07:13.391 --> 07:18.396
Strange little children in the street say it to me, and I feel rather foolish.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.582
God bless thee, my child.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.367
The weather has been absolutely heavenly.

07:26.188 --> 07:39.623
Such clouds, rainbows, pink rainstorms with bright green hills showing through, churches coming and going through the rain, or wrapped in pale green cocoons of mist.

07:41.225 --> 07:44.489
Oh dear, I am of two minds about selling.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.472
If only things were a bit different.

07:49.392 --> 07:55.259
We have had such a nice young man visiting, too, a former Peace Corps boy from Chattanooga.

07:56.099 --> 08:04.409
Old Episcopalian family, one brother a minister, et cetera, went to Harvard, where his mother thought he would become depraved.

08:07.492 --> 08:10.936
He bought a big old fazenda with a friend and worked it.

08:12.077 --> 08:16.362
A long story he didn't go into, but the friend committed suicide.

08:16.645 --> 08:21.752
And now this boy's legal problems are very much like mine, only a great deal worse.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.717
Perhaps that has cheered me up more, too.

08:26.458 --> 08:28.881
I didn't think anyone could be worse than mine.

08:30.383 --> 08:39.915
He hung pictures, cleaned the gramophone, sorted all the records, knew about electricity and plumbing, and he's coming back, I'm glad to say.

08:41.698 --> 08:45.943
I just learned today that Rocco, too, had committed suicide.

08:46.885 --> 08:51.952
I don't know anything about him, except that he came from someplace along the Washington coast.

08:52.653 --> 08:54.997
That's where he got a lot of those beautiful colors.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.081
Oh, why?

08:59.423 --> 09:00.064
I wonder.

09:01.666 --> 09:11.941
Heavens, what a veil of tears it is.

09:11.961 --> 09:16.167
And the last one.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.115
Pink Dog.

09:22.139 --> 09:30.188
It's the last poem Elizabeth completed, though she'd begun it years before when she first started to think about leaving Brazil.

09:31.289 --> 09:43.603
It's a kind of ironic samba that combines two of her favorite genres, the poem in which she gives advice and the poem in which she identifies with an animal.

09:44.884 --> 09:45.765
In a footnote,

09:46.252 --> 09:53.059
She explained that Fantasia is a carnival costume and Mascara is a mask.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.611
Pink Dog, Rio de Janeiro.

10:07.414 --> 10:10.557
The sun is blazing and the sky is blue.

10:11.798 --> 10:15.482
Umbrellas close the beach in every hue.

10:16.762 --> 10:19.365
Naked, you trot across the avenue.

10:20.726 --> 10:26.893
Oh, never have I seen a dog so bare, naked and pink, without a single hair.

10:28.434 --> 10:31.978
Startled, the passersby draw back and stare.

10:33.479 --> 10:35.962
Of course, they're mortally afraid of rabies.

10:37.704 --> 10:38.705
You are not mad.

10:40.106 --> 10:43.129
You have a case of scabies.

10:43.149 --> 10:44.371
But look intelligent.

10:45.372 --> 10:46.633
Where are your babies?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.803
a nursing mother by those hanging teats.

10:52.145 --> 11:01.195
In what slums have you hidden them, poor bitch, while you go begging, living by your wits?

11:01.215 --> 11:01.976
Didn't you know?

11:01.996 --> 11:07.322
It's been in all the papers to solve this problem, how they deal with beggars.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.288
They take and throw them in the tidal rivers.

11:12.308 --> 11:16.553
Yet, idiots, paralytics, parasites,

11:16.837 --> 11:23.187
go bobbing in the ebbing sewage, nights out in the suburbs where there are no lights.

11:25.070 --> 11:39.132
If they do this to anyone who begs, drunk or sober, with or without legs, what would they do to stick more like your dogs in the cafes,

11:39.280 --> 11:49.371
And on the sidewalk corners, the joke is going round that all the beggars who can afford them now wear life preservers.

11:49.391 --> 11:56.798
In your condition, you would not be able even to float, much less to dog paddle.

11:56.818 --> 12:03.385
Now look, the practical, the sensible solution is to wear a fantasia.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.870
Tonight, you simply can't afford to be an eyeball.

12:08.727 --> 12:13.432
But no one will ever see a dog in Moscow this time of year.

12:15.054 --> 12:16.355
Ash Wednesday will come.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.637
But a carnival is here.

12:19.438 --> 12:21.240
What sambas can you dance?

12:21.821 --> 12:22.862
What will you wear?

12:22.922 --> 12:26.966
They say that carnival is degenerating.

12:27.767 --> 12:32.072
Radios, Americans, or something have ruined it completely.

12:33.113 --> 12:34.354
They're just talking.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.278
Carnival is always wonderful.

12:39.237 --> 12:42.260
A deflated dog would not look well.

12:43.621 --> 12:44.142
Dress up.

12:45.543 --> 12:47.725
Dress up and dance at carnival.

13:07.384 --> 13:08.805
We've heard a lot about Steve.

13:09.055 --> 13:17.606
but there's another side to Bishop in the portable rather.

13:17.626 --> 13:24.715
I was reflecting as I was sitting here on the beauty of proper names by contrast to nicknames.

13:24.755 --> 13:30.943
Wouldn't it be awful if we were calling her Lizzie Bishop or Beth Bishop or something, Elizabeth Bishop.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.287
The poet is

13:34.739 --> 13:39.886
Often I think Bishop was crucified between journalism and the academic life.

13:41.368 --> 13:42.229
Somewhere in between.

13:42.289 --> 13:52.202
Bishop agreed for money to do a book on Brazil in the Time Life series of books about different countries.

13:52.783 --> 13:54.645
She regretted it before she had finished.

13:56.007 --> 13:59.472
Because Time kept trying to make her over, naturally.

14:00.733 --> 14:04.358
And they wanted her to write in the Time style.

14:07.949 --> 14:14.979
Along with the rest of the mail was a contract with life from my agent.

14:14.999 --> 14:23.330
Oh, oh, oh, I don't know what to think or say or do, except that I guess I've already done it, except that I'm having a hideous time writing the thing.

14:24.131 --> 14:29.298
But once I made the bargain, I suppose the thing to do is just write as fast as possible and try not to think about it.

14:31.001 --> 14:32.843
No use for slow bass.

14:32.958 --> 14:45.950
Though I can't think it's too close any other way, because they'll just put it through their own meat grinder lawfully, and it will stop sounding like that no matter what I say.

14:45.970 --> 14:52.436
My agents did their best, but all that amounts to is that I at least have the right to fight with them.

14:53.197 --> 14:56.460
I only hope it's going to be worth the $9,000 I'll get out of it.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.602
Doesn't look as if it worked to me so far.

14:59.363 --> 15:01.665
And the worst is really that, like the publishers,

15:02.236 --> 15:16.196
Sorry, the worst is really that life publishers, they keep paying lip service to distinguished writing, your own opinion, your fine reputation of blah, blah, blah, lying like drugs.

15:16.316 --> 15:23.165
It was really a weird process, and now I know that others have before me.

15:24.207 --> 15:27.231
I must tell you, the life editor wrote me that

15:27.667 --> 15:30.632
You'd be surprised how much help an outline is.

15:35.940 --> 15:45.996
Although it may seem like a burden, a bibliography of the books I'm moving, would be a good idea to teach our grandmother to suck.

15:49.165 --> 15:52.429
They are incredible, that's all.

15:52.810 --> 16:01.722
It's really more like manufacturing synthetic-equipped cream under the byproducts of a plastic factory than anything remotely connected with writing, even journalistic writing.

16:02.383 --> 16:07.831
I put on one display a temperament and the energy had been running around, all fluttering and consoling.

16:08.411 --> 16:14.059
The awful thing is I feel so sorry for him with his great grace and thanks a million.

16:14.596 --> 16:19.244
They also tell us from New York to ask if I've ever been a communist.

16:22.089 --> 16:28.099
Probably some infant editor saw a poem in a partisan review and the name terrified me.

16:28.299 --> 16:30.663
On the whole, they behave exactly the way the U.S.

16:30.683 --> 16:31.765
Embassy does here.

16:33.127 --> 16:39.979
Then there's also the academic world.

16:41.579 --> 16:48.865
for a tiny little anecdote from her classes, which is typical of what she might write about her classes.

16:48.885 --> 17:04.599
Speaking of George Herbert, I wanted my writing class to read Love Unknown, one of my favorite poems of his, the certain points I was trying to make, and being lazy, I asked my dear John Peach to read it aloud, out of an old edition Cale gave me.

17:05.240 --> 17:10.945
He didn't know about the old English long S, it looks like an F, being used in a set of S,

17:11.262 --> 17:13.273
So he began.

17:13.490 --> 17:23.324
Dear friend, sit down.

17:23.345 --> 17:25.888
Dear friend, sit down.

17:25.948 --> 17:30.195
The chair was long and fat.

17:30.235 --> 17:31.837
We all started laughing.

17:31.917 --> 17:36.524
Oh boy, he just couldn't be this, so I had to do it myself.

17:36.544 --> 17:42.012
And then I want to read the last letter.

17:42.565 --> 17:52.436
This was to John Frederick Rims, the poet and anthology, and he had put her in an anthology, only the anthology has footnotes.

17:52.457 --> 17:57.382
This is driving her crazy, all the little bubbles that go down the page and little distractions from the poem.

17:58.423 --> 18:05.852
I'm going to take issue with you, she wrote this the day she died, I'm going to take issue with you rather violently about the idea of footnotes.

18:06.533 --> 18:10.918
With one or two exceptions, I'll mention them later, I don't think there should be any footnotes.

18:11.438 --> 18:16.971
You said the book is for college students, and I think anyone who gets as far as college will be able to use the dictionary.

18:17.672 --> 18:23.466
If a book catches a student's interest at all, he or she should damn well be able to look up an unfamiliar word in the dictionary.

18:24.107 --> 18:28.317
I know they don't, or most of them don't, but they should be made to somehow.

18:28.499 --> 18:33.547
The earlier English forms you are using, of course, may require some help, but mine certainly doesn't.

18:33.927 --> 18:40.237
I can glance it in the dictionary, so is Gow, G-U-N-W-A-L-E, and so is Dwarfs.

18:40.377 --> 18:41.859
These three words occur in the fish.

18:43.301 --> 18:45.224
One of my few exceptions is the S.O.

18:45.344 --> 18:50.372
Exxon note to filling station, because I'm not sure how long ago now that happened, but a good many years.

18:50.960 --> 18:59.828
Although I let students figure out, in fact, I tell them in a poem that can't have arranged to say so, so, so, et cetera, as so, so, so, so.

19:00.328 --> 19:02.010
I don't think that has to be explained.

19:02.930 --> 19:11.578
However, most of them might well not know that so, so, so was, perhaps still is in some places, the phrase people use to soothe and calm horses.

19:12.839 --> 19:16.242
I don't think too many people do know that.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.785
All flower names can be looked up, certainly.

19:20.153 --> 19:22.356
Some students even see flowers still.

19:25.199 --> 19:33.969
Though I know only too well the TV has weakened the sense of reality, and so very few students see anything the way it was in real life.

19:35.611 --> 19:42.860
You see what a nasty teacher I must see, but I do think students get lazier and lazier in the fact they have everything done for them.

19:43.501 --> 19:47.325
But I suggest buying a small paperback, almost the whole class wise,

19:47.592 --> 19:48.875
Where can I find it?

19:51.059 --> 19:55.688
My best example of this sort of thing is what one rather bright, hard and honest student told me.

19:56.049 --> 20:04.485
She told her roommate or a friend, who had obviously taken my words writing course, that she was doing her paper with me and the friend said, oh, don't work with her, it's awful.

20:04.846 --> 20:07.170
She wants you to look words up in the dictionary.

20:07.531 --> 20:10.056
It isn't creative at all.

20:12.078 --> 20:16.742
In other words, that is not enough what you're writing or reading.

20:17.163 --> 20:19.805
Perhaps my class at MIT has embittered me.

20:20.365 --> 20:33.938
But some of NYU and some of the Harvard classes, though there have been good students and a few wonderful ones from time to time, that they mostly seem to think that poetry, to read or to write, is a snap one just has to feel underline.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.199
And not for very long, either.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.224
Well, I could go on and on, but I won't.

20:41.862 --> 20:55.946
Two or three years ago, I was talking away about the quake at Graveyard, and when I asked a question, the whole class responded in chorus, with what I discovered was, I was reading my own book, what I discovered was the footnotes from the Norton Anthology.

20:55.966 --> 21:01.916
I'm right in that case, but again, if I'm wrong, we finally all got to laughing, but that was an unusually bright class.

21:02.697 --> 21:08.106
Of course, I'm writing this just about my own inclusion, and the moose may well be too long,

21:08.390 --> 21:13.435
Of course, there are many historically early poems I perceive the necessity of the notes for.

21:13.455 --> 21:17.599
If the moose is too long, I suggest another from Geography 3, any you like.

21:17.619 --> 21:29.151
I do hope I haven't offended you now, but I think the teaching of literature is deplorable now, and if you could get students to reading, underline, you would have done a noble work, affectionately.

21:29.992 --> 21:37.620
I suppose I simply want to read a little sonnet that Elizabeth wrote, a little upside-down sonnet.

21:38.073 --> 21:41.999
As most of you know, instead of eight and six, it's six and eight.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.824
And each of the two parts are introduced by a past participle.

21:46.205 --> 21:52.594
The first little sestet part introduced by the past participle caught while the soul was still in the body.

21:53.255 --> 21:59.745
And the octave, the last part, introduced by the word freeze after the soul had been released from the body.

21:59.765 --> 22:02.769
But it's a little dimitrish on it, a little thin thing.

22:03.811 --> 22:06.915
Caught, the bubbles in the spirit level,

22:07.503 --> 22:15.172
a creature divided, and the compass needle wobbling and wavering, unsighted.

22:15.192 --> 22:26.325
Freed, the broken, the momentous Mercury running away, and the rainbow bird from the narrow bevel of the empty mirror flying wherever it feels like, hey.

22:29.549 --> 22:29.629
Wow.

22:50.720 --> 22:59.669
just read an extract from a prose poem and an extract from a letter and a poem.

23:01.191 --> 23:07.257
I once said in a lecture that there was something Cordelia-like about the music of Frank Lloyd.

23:08.438 --> 23:12.462
There's certainly plenty of chatter in the letters.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.644
I have to revise that a little bit.

23:15.065 --> 23:20.170
But I meant that kind of reticence that was, that's

23:26.174 --> 23:43.450
But there's also in her, as a writer, something which she describes in a phrase in the story, In the Village, an immense, sibilant, glistening loneliness.

23:44.931 --> 23:54.099
And there's a prose poem called Giant Snail, which has both the containment and the sibilant, glistening loneliness in it.

23:54.259 --> 23:56.181
And I just read the conclusion of that.

23:59.823 --> 24:05.010
My sides move in rhythmic waves just off the ground, from front to back.

24:05.731 --> 24:11.759
The wake of a ship, wax white water, or a slowly melting flow.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.765
I am cold, cold, cold as ice.

24:17.987 --> 24:21.832
My blind white bull's head was a cretin's scare head.

24:22.933 --> 24:26.438
Degenerate, my four horns that can't attack.

24:27.768 --> 24:30.010
The sides of my mouth are now my hands.

24:31.452 --> 24:33.754
They press the earth and suck it hard.

24:35.456 --> 24:41.203
Ah, but I know my shell is beautiful and high and glazed and shining.

24:41.483 --> 24:44.166
I know it well, although I have not seen it.

24:44.186 --> 24:46.909
Its curled white lip is of the finest enamel.

24:47.750 --> 24:52.695
Inside it is as smooth as silk, and I, I fill it to perfection.

24:54.548 --> 24:57.791
My wide wake shines now that it's going dark.

24:58.992 --> 25:01.735
I leave a lovely opalescent ribbon.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.016
I know this.

25:04.577 --> 25:06.359
But oh, I'm too big.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.061
I feel it.

25:09.302 --> 25:09.922
Pity me.

25:11.664 --> 25:16.869
If and when I reach the rock, I shall go into a certain crack there for the night.

25:17.510 --> 25:22.294
The waterfall below will vibrate through my shell and body all night long.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.803
In that steady pulsing, I can rest.

25:27.004 --> 25:30.208
All night, I shall be like a sleeping ear.

25:33.832 --> 25:45.285
I think when we read the vision, certainly when I read some of her poems, I'm always tempted to revise Keats, who said, remember, darkling, I listen.

25:45.305 --> 25:51.572
It's always about vision for me, if you want to say, brightling, I hear.

25:52.531 --> 25:55.434
and the language.

25:55.454 --> 26:00.720
And just to say something about the letters, I think this is what's so deeply satisfying about the letters.

26:01.962 --> 26:08.329
In the letter she does what the poet Cheslaw Miłosz says, that the poet is unearthed to do.

26:09.390 --> 26:16.318
Line by line, phrase by phrase, detail by detail, one thing is noticed and recorded after another.

26:17.199 --> 26:21.103
So what she does spontaneously is, in Miłosz's words,

26:21.843 --> 26:24.648
glorify things just because they are.

26:26.050 --> 26:38.571
I think her letters endorse the value of a life of sensations and of thoughts, a life of gossip and cooking, poetry and particularity.

26:40.734 --> 26:48.627
And I think amid the slippages of the post-modern, you might say, and the insecurities we're supposed

26:53.500 --> 26:54.602
in the intellectual life.

26:55.823 --> 27:08.182
These letters and poems are a real reminder of the value of the, as it were, pre-literate world, a world that's still there for all of us, and still reachable.

27:08.202 --> 27:21.702
If only we had the kind of commitment, and this is a wonderful kind of example of civilization in these letters, the commitment to value, the minute particular, and to connect ourselves to it.

27:22.964 --> 27:38.917
I want to read one of the many bishop poems that connect me to my own pre-literate life, to a word where there used to be cock fights at Easter, roosters in the yard, and indeed religious ceremonies during Holy Week, where I read about St.

27:38.937 --> 27:39.218
Peter.

27:56.562 --> 28:11.779
The poem is Rooster's, and it's one of the great anti-patriarchy poems, written in 1940, anti-militarist, anti-feminist poem, I want to wear better you might say.

28:11.799 --> 28:18.327
Very conscious, very crafted, a poem that marked her coming of age as an artist.

28:19.028 --> 28:25.455
And in her famous letter, by now famous because it was so well used by David Goldstone in his book,

28:25.908 --> 28:34.876
She comes away from Marianne Moore's tutelage and decides that she will write the poem her own way.

28:35.236 --> 28:39.640
This is the letter in which she defends her poem.

28:42.102 --> 28:47.127
What I'm about to say, I'm afraid, will sound like Elizabeth knows Beth.

28:50.169 --> 28:55.594
I feel, let me see, I can't seem to bring myself to give up the set form.

28:56.215 --> 28:59.199
which I'm afraid you think fills the poem with redundancies, etc.

28:59.679 --> 29:03.524
I feel that the rather rattle-trap rhythm is appropriate.

29:03.544 --> 29:04.745
Maybe I can explain it.

29:05.426 --> 29:14.356
I cherish my water closet and the other sordidities because I want to emphasize the essential baseness of militarism.

29:14.376 --> 29:23.387
In the first part I was thinking of Key West, but also, this is 1940, also of those aerial views of dismal little towns in Finland and Norway

29:23.722 --> 29:26.445
when the Germans took over in their atmosphere of poverty.

29:27.065 --> 29:34.372
That's why, although I see what you mean, I want to keep tin rooster instead of gold and not use assiduous beds.

29:34.913 --> 29:42.740
And for the same reason, I want to keep the title of the rather contemptuous word, roosters, instead of the more classical, the cock.

29:42.841 --> 29:45.403
And I want to repeat gunmetal.

29:45.423 --> 29:50.488
I also had in mind the violent roosters Picasso did in connection with the Guernica picture.

29:51.700 --> 30:01.850
About the glass-headed pins, I feel the roosters to be placed here and there by their various crowings, like the pins that point out war projects on a map.

30:02.631 --> 30:04.212
Maybe I haven't made it clear enough.

30:04.993 --> 30:07.435
And I want to keep to see the end.

30:07.716 --> 30:12.440
That's what Peter, in the gospel story, he stays to see the end.

30:12.460 --> 30:19.547
I want to keep to see the end in quotes because, although it may not be generally recognized, I have always felt the expression used

30:35.035 --> 30:54.280
At four o'clock, in the gunmetal blue dark, we hear the first crow of the first cock, just below the gunmetal blue window.

30:54.781 --> 31:01.009
And immediately there is an echo off in the distance, then one from the backyard fence, then one

31:01.343 --> 31:08.830
Horrible insistence grates like a wet match from the broccoli patch, flares, and all of our town begins to catch.

31:09.731 --> 31:31.030
Cries galore from the water-crossed door, from the dropping plastered henhouse floor, where in the blue blur their rustling wives admire, the roosters brace their cruel feet and glare with stupid eyes, while from their beaks there rise the uncontrolled traditional cries.

31:32.107 --> 32:01.810
Deep from protruding chests In green gold medals dressed Planned to command and terrorize the rest The many wives who lead hen's lives Are being quoted and despised Deep from raw throats A senseless order floats all over town A rooster floats over our beds From rusty iron sheds And fences made from old bedsteads Over our churches Where the tinny rooster perches

32:02.009 --> 32:31.257
over our little wooden northern houses, making sallies from all the muddy alleys, marking out maps like Rand McNally, glass-headed pins, oil golds, and copper greens, anthracite blues, Alisa rings, each one an act of displacement in perspective, each screaming, this is where I live, each screaming, get up, stop dreaming, boosters,

32:31.456 --> 32:32.698
What are you projecting?

32:33.319 --> 32:41.050
You whom the Greeks elect to shoot at on a post, who struggled when sacrificed, you whom they labeled very combative.

32:41.771 --> 32:45.717
What right of you to give commands and tell us how to live?

32:46.398 --> 32:55.271
Cry here and here and wake us here where our unwanted love, conceit and war.

32:56.793 --> 33:01.260
The crown of red set on your little head is charged with all your fighting blood.

33:01.780 --> 33:09.332
Yes, that excrescence mixed amongst virile presence, plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.660
Now in mid-air, by Tuesday, fight each other.

33:14.641 --> 33:23.135
Down comes a first flame feather, and one is flying with raging heroism, defying even the sensation of dying.

33:23.155 --> 33:24.177
And one has fallen.

33:33.353 --> 33:46.193
is flung on the gray ash heap, lies in dung with his dead wives, with open, bloody eyes when those metallic feathers oxidize.

33:46.213 --> 33:46.513
St.

33:46.533 --> 33:59.513
Peter's sin was worse than that of Magdalene, whose sins were not the flesh alone of still Peter's, falling beneath the flares among the servants of the office.

34:00.877 --> 34:06.326
Old holy sculpture could set it all together in one small scene, past and future.

34:06.947 --> 34:08.489
Christ stands amazed.

34:08.950 --> 34:13.678
Peter, two fingers raised to surprise lips, both as if days.

34:14.739 --> 34:27.660
But in between, a little cockpit scene, carved on a dim column in the travertine, explained by gallows cannet, fled petrood underneath it.

34:28.906 --> 34:33.050
There is inescapable hope, the pill, yes.

34:33.570 --> 34:39.296
And there, Peter's tears, rung-dung on earth, dancing to your sides, and gems spurs.

34:39.956 --> 34:43.940
Tear, encrusted thick as a medieval relic, he waits.

34:44.821 --> 34:50.947
Go, Peter, heart-sick, still cannot guess those cock-a-doodles yet my dress.

34:50.967 --> 34:53.809
His dreadful booster come to mean forgiveness.

34:54.650 --> 34:57.613
A new weather vane on basilica and barns,

34:58.133 --> 35:22.018
and that outside the lantern there would always be a bronze cock on a porphyry pillar, so the people and the Pope might see that even the prince of the apostles long since had been forgiven, and to convince all the assembly that deny, deny, deny is not all the rooster's cry.

35:23.700 --> 35:27.043
In the morning, a little light was floating in the backyard,

35:27.378 --> 35:35.428
and gilding from underneath the broccoli, leaf by leaf, hardly the might have come to grief.

35:35.449 --> 35:46.583
Gliding through gilding the tiny floating swallows' belly and lines of pink cloud in the sky, the days preamble like wandering lines in marble.

35:47.524 --> 35:51.269
The cocks are now almost inaudible.

35:51.289 --> 35:57.317
The sun climbs in, following to see the end, faithful ad enemy,

35:58.124 --> 36:23.372
We're going to close the proceedings with

36:33.562 --> 36:36.286
The art of losing isn't hard to master.

36:37.167 --> 36:42.976
So many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

36:43.897 --> 36:51.529
Lose something every day, except the cluster of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.

36:51.549 --> 36:53.792
The art of losing isn't hard to master.

36:54.513 --> 37:02.725
Then practice losing farther, losing faster, places and names, and where it was you meant to travel.

37:03.211 --> 37:05.833
None of these will bring disaster.

37:05.853 --> 37:07.275
I lost my mother's watch.

37:07.855 --> 37:13.320
And look, my last or next to last of three loved houses went.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.342
The art of losing is important to master.

37:17.403 --> 37:21.987
I lost two cities, lovely ones, and vast as some realms.

37:22.548 --> 37:25.771
I owned two rivers, a continent.

37:25.791 --> 37:28.593
I missed them, but it wasn't a disaster.

37:29.974 --> 37:33.117
Even losing you, the joking voice,

37:36.235 --> 37:45.925
It's evident the art of losing is not too hard to master, and what may look like riot, not disaster.

38:10.272 --> 38:11.069
Bye.
