00:02.326 --> 00:08.234
I'll just put this over here.

00:10.938 --> 00:20.070
You came to this, your involvement in Hypertext is a very interesting phenomenon for me to see.

00:20.090 --> 00:23.635
You're an established, respected novelist in print.

00:23.735 --> 00:26.279
How do we account for this?

00:26.419 --> 00:31.506
Well, there's several reasons, but one of the things I should have brought along, I didn't think of it, now that you brought that up.

00:31.638 --> 00:42.572
Back in the 60s, I developed a note-taking mechanism.

00:44.514 --> 00:49.761
Using these edge-notch cards, the kind of cards that have little holes around the edges.

00:49.781 --> 00:54.366
You sometimes see full-page ones used for filing kinds of things.

00:55.508 --> 00:57.450
They have these little rows.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.653
You take a punch,

01:01.405 --> 01:06.551
And I came on this character who was having a really hard time.

01:06.611 --> 01:11.217
He said, can you tell me how you get into the computer system?

01:11.237 --> 01:12.919
So I showed him how you do that.

01:12.939 --> 01:18.926
And I thought, well, you know, I've been only on really working hard at it for three, four weeks myself.

01:18.986 --> 01:23.091
But I felt very smart because this guy was really needing help.

01:23.131 --> 01:27.176
So I helped him through his little beginning struggles and so on.

01:27.876 --> 01:30.079
And the next time I saw him,

01:30.059 --> 01:32.384
He was doing some fabulous stuff.

01:32.404 --> 01:34.790
And I watched him and said, my God.

01:34.850 --> 01:36.253
First of all, I said, how are you doing?

01:36.474 --> 01:37.336
I looked what he was doing.

01:37.416 --> 01:39.020
I couldn't believe it.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.666
And it turned out that he had helped build computers.

01:41.686 --> 01:42.708
He knew everything about them.

01:42.989 --> 01:44.372
He did it.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.247
They didn't know how to log in.

01:46.267 --> 01:49.070
I mean, that's a little thing you have to learn.

01:49.090 --> 01:55.058
And so he became, in a way, a kind of—he taught me a lot of things.

01:55.218 --> 01:56.540
We became friends.

01:56.780 --> 02:01.806
And I got him—he was a Milton scholar in the grad—English grad school.

02:02.347 --> 02:10.917
But he's really interested to play here, and I got him appointed as a computer adjunct to the English department.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.760
And he did a lot of things for us.

02:12.780 --> 02:17.609
And he helped found this IRIS group.

02:17.629 --> 02:22.698
They developed a hypertext software called Intermedia.

02:22.998 --> 02:28.769
And a professor friend of mine, George Landau, got interested in this stuff.

02:28.809 --> 02:29.530
Landau's famous.

02:29.851 --> 02:30.732
Yeah.

02:30.772 --> 02:34.018
Well, Landau was involved with IRIS.

02:33.998 --> 02:38.304
helped to develop intermedia and was the first to use it.

02:38.324 --> 02:45.915
So, in the late 80s, he was urging me to get into it myself.

02:46.035 --> 02:50.381
Of course, well, that was kind of more than I wanted to get involved with.

02:50.501 --> 02:53.806
It looked kind of complicated, my own little things to do.

02:54.607 --> 03:01.677
And I thought, well, I'll get a student, a student who was very keen on getting into it, a grad student, I'll get him a teaching class.

03:01.657 --> 03:05.765
I had a job for a year, teaching a beginning hypertext workshop.

03:05.785 --> 03:06.406
I failed.

03:06.426 --> 03:11.075
I cried, and they said, no, if you apply for it, you might do it, but we can't do this for students.

03:11.095 --> 03:16.887
So I went away on a sabbatical, and I came back, and I had a free course to choose.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.632
I was teaching a workshop, and I could do something else.

03:19.612 --> 03:23.937
I ran into Landao, and of course I went, all right, I'll have a go.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.241
But at this time, I still had never had a mouse in my hand.

03:27.261 --> 03:29.704
I had no idea about these things.

03:29.724 --> 03:31.366
I'd never played with Windows.

03:31.626 --> 03:33.749
I was still a DOS user thoroughly.

03:34.650 --> 03:38.154
I'd created my own macros and saw I inside DOS, but I had no idea.

03:38.194 --> 03:43.881
This was pre-Windows, and I'd never

03:44.198 --> 03:47.486
and then on a Mac I looked over people's shoulders at him.

03:47.807 --> 03:55.226
So I taught according to him, I taught on Mac, because he had that window.

03:57.432 --> 03:59.878
I got an assistant, a grad student,

03:59.858 --> 04:14.880
who was badgering me to be his undergraduate advisor for his thesis, and I was turning him down, and then we got into this hypertext stuff, and he said, would you like a TA for that work?

04:14.860 --> 04:18.186
He said, yeah, you know, he had Landau's course, so he made a deal.

04:18.286 --> 04:20.590
I would be his advisor, he'd be my TA.

04:21.411 --> 04:24.717
That fellow is Robert Arellano, who is still there.

04:24.917 --> 04:32.930
Yeah, well, Bobby is really, really good, and I've managed over the years to keep finding him.

04:32.950 --> 04:41.104
So he's on a presidential fellowship there now for three years, and teaching my hyperculture workshops on Illinois.

04:41.438 --> 04:45.605
So he was my team.

04:45.625 --> 04:49.772
We had a class, and about ten students, brave students, decided to have a go.

04:49.852 --> 04:52.817
They didn't know what this was, and I didn't know what it was.

04:52.837 --> 04:55.000
And there was nothing quite published.

04:55.021 --> 05:01.371
There were a couple of things that Eastgate was producing at that time, but Michael Joyce's afternoon was still handed around this.

05:01.672 --> 05:26.008
it wasn't you know it wasn't well i think in fact he's just about to publish it but the copy we had and stuff so all of the early hypertext fiction was still in the developmental stage and there was a group at brown which i often went to their meetings called chug computers and humanities users group chug chug invited

05:26.309 --> 05:31.635
people come talk about computer issues in the humanities, and library issues very typically.

05:31.735 --> 05:44.830
I was aware of how libraries were changing back in the mid to late 80s, attending those meetings.

05:44.910 --> 05:48.975
Stuart Malthrop and Michael Joyce had been invitees, so I'd seen a bit what they were doing.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.731
then they left stuff behind.

05:52.211 --> 05:53.753
So we had some sense of it.

05:53.773 --> 06:06.608
We didn't know really, I was completely unaware of what would happen, and that's what that first piece was based on, was an opening experience, an opening awareness of how the stuff worked.

06:06.628 --> 06:14.136
I don't confess to my 60s involvement with a similar idea, but that's what made it easy, so that I was not

06:14.116 --> 06:19.821
I was not surprised at the possibility.

06:19.861 --> 06:22.384
In fact, they looked like enhancements.

06:22.744 --> 06:24.706
And just to go back, what did you call that machine?

06:24.726 --> 06:25.907
Did you have a name for that machine?

06:26.127 --> 06:31.132
It was just edge-notch cards, and you used a punch and steel needles.

06:31.392 --> 06:31.732
That's all.

06:31.812 --> 06:34.275
And it was basically an early database?

06:34.295 --> 06:36.637
Yeah, it was a database idea.

06:37.037 --> 06:41.001
And in fact, it was a kind of...

06:41.470 --> 06:52.206
hand-punched way of doing what was developing shortly thereafter, in the early 70s, was those computer cards that you'd see.

06:52.266 --> 06:54.168
I don't know if you ever saw the composer's work.

06:55.150 --> 07:06.847
I was at Princeton for a year and got to know Babbitt and all his people and had this electronic, the Princeton-Columbian Electronic Music Center.

07:06.867 --> 07:08.609
And the computer music was just catching on.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.410
It's a new idea.

07:10.292 --> 07:11.173
But it was done with

07:11.980 --> 07:14.404
immense decks of punched cards.

07:14.484 --> 07:17.610
I mean, immense decks of punched cards to get a little bit of sound.

07:17.630 --> 07:18.992
I mean, it wasn't yet much.

07:19.012 --> 07:20.174
It was just a huge thing.

07:20.535 --> 07:23.901
Well, mine was like an even more primitive version of that.

07:24.322 --> 07:26.866
Those punches, at least you could order up these.

07:26.886 --> 07:28.970
I had to actually get the punch out for it.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.791
It looked like that.

07:30.032 --> 07:35.201
But was it an exercise for you, or was it actually useful as a retrieval system for information?

07:35.421 --> 07:36.503
It would have been.

07:36.803 --> 07:42.311
very useful, but for the fact that the punching took a lot longer than the note-taking.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.973
And it led to ideas.

07:43.993 --> 08:05.342
You'd be, take a card that would have, I don't know, about hypertext, let's say, I'd written some notes about it, and I would see that there would be reason to punch it for reasons of hypertext and for reasons of computers, for reasons of writing, but also maybe because of its content, for reasons of

08:05.660 --> 08:11.127
Oh, I don't know, some social issue or some question about time and space or whatever.

08:11.688 --> 08:16.854
And the more I thought about the way to punch it, or to get more and more punches, I would think of new notes.

08:16.874 --> 08:21.099
So I'd be writing six or seven notes while I was working to punch the one card.

08:21.119 --> 08:23.743
So I ended up with lots of unpunched cards and a few of them.

08:23.923 --> 08:25.044
That was the main problem.

08:25.805 --> 08:30.111
And I probably had, in the end, generated a few thousand cards.

08:30.271 --> 08:34.536
They still exist like three-by-fives, really, because the holds I had have been effective.

08:34.887 --> 08:57.000
I figured out the binary idea was a way to do something fast, and so that if it was bibliography or if it was certain kinds of content or something like that, if it didn't say anything else, at least I could find it through that, down the narrow edge, I had about twelve, sixteen bunches there, that I divided up into things that were quick access of a kind.

08:57.140 --> 09:02.869
I said, well, that was something about history or something about, you know, those kind of large topics.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.724
So I could needle those out in a hurry, and I did manage to punch those up pretty quickly.

09:07.764 --> 09:11.447
So most of the cards have one punch on one side, but that's about it.

09:11.647 --> 09:21.916
Now, as a novelist, in the traditional linear print sense, do you have a sense of permanence, I mean?

09:21.936 --> 09:32.265
Do you have a permanence of the texts, of what you create, and having it remain in a... Well, yes and no.

09:32.549 --> 09:38.357
I mean, the permanence of the text will exist in the computer, it won't exist on paper.

09:38.557 --> 09:46.285
So already there's a kind of anomaly about it, but what we think of as permanent has already moved to light anyhow.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.207
To light.

09:48.327 --> 10:07.247
There will always be, as there are still monasteries and libraries with valuable manuscripts under glass, there will always be this kind of respect for the Gutenberg condition, whether it moved into a museum.

10:07.227 --> 10:14.783
It's a very cumbersome technology relative to the movement of light.

10:15.124 --> 10:21.017
Moving a book, moving the volume.

10:22.077 --> 10:36.665
around, hundreds of these things around, in trucks, using up petrol and shelf space and warehouse space and so on, is incredibly comprehensive compared to computer storage.

10:37.467 --> 10:44.220
So, I think publishing, for example, years ago I asked publishers, I mean,

10:44.588 --> 11:11.254
just before i even got the hypertext so in the late 80s i was asking why are they actually publishing the books why don't they get the bookstores to do publishing they provide you provide your text by computer those days by this now by email um provide them the text and they can do the printing and finding and so on there's no need to have these huge this huge warehousing and pulping and you know having all these

11:11.352 --> 11:15.638
But, of course, business is used to owning things that they sell.

11:15.658 --> 11:19.944
They're not, you know, toothpaste or toilet paper or books.

11:19.964 --> 11:27.254
And so they think of it as if you don't have this product, it's not, you know, as they're getting out of that finally.

11:27.274 --> 11:29.336
But they couldn't kind of perceive that.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.919
Now it's going to happen.

11:31.359 --> 11:37.107
And I think in the next decade, not even to say about it anymore.

11:37.424 --> 11:44.072
There will be increasing publishing by the bookstores, and the book chains especially.

11:44.112 --> 11:49.499
They may actually start hiring their own little editorial staffs and just do it straight.

11:49.900 --> 12:00.293
And the idea will be that with a kind of inexpensive binding mechanism and cover design can also be done computerized and moved by light.

12:00.897 --> 12:04.040
produce all the books in their bookstores.

12:04.581 --> 12:11.048
You'll come in and say, I would like a copy of this, I'd like a copy of that, and come back in the afternoon.

12:11.068 --> 12:15.353
I went to the MIT Media Lab for this book, this project I'm working on.

12:15.373 --> 12:21.299
There's a young man, they're 29 years old, and he's hitting the project called the e-book, the electronic book.

12:21.319 --> 12:22.300
You've heard of this?

12:22.580 --> 12:24.282
And it will look like a regular codex.

12:24.843 --> 12:29.588
And they said it two or three years away from it, and they're doing this with electronic ink, and you will put

12:29.855 --> 12:34.863
You'll load each one of these volumes that you'll buy with a little chip.

12:34.943 --> 12:36.746
It'll have 3,000 books in it.

12:37.267 --> 12:38.910
And you dial up the book that you want.

12:38.930 --> 12:43.337
And then each page, we have a paper-like texture.

12:43.357 --> 12:44.900
You'll read the book.

12:45.601 --> 12:47.464
Each page will be a screen.

12:47.484 --> 12:48.766
And we're working on this.

12:48.786 --> 12:51.711
My wife, in fact, found this item, and I went to this.

12:51.860 --> 12:57.907
But we're still talking about discrete work that is not changing.

12:58.187 --> 13:03.514
When I'm talking about permanence, I'm talking about artistic creation and expression.

13:03.614 --> 13:06.157
There's no need for hypertext to change either.

13:06.177 --> 13:18.051
I mean, the interactivity that's so much rooted about is not necessarily a standard feature of this stuff.

13:18.772 --> 13:20.854
We're having an impact on getting into the conference.

13:21.188 --> 13:34.906
on these issues at Brown in the next spring, inviting a lot of the techies in and mixing them up with writers so that we try to get the right code.

13:34.926 --> 13:46.842
Right now, much of this is, especially as seen on the internet, is hostile to text and the idea to text of any kind.

13:47.243 --> 14:02.698
possible to anything that isn't Victorian or horrible, and to try to create a warmer atmosphere for this in the way they develop a new technology.

14:03.919 --> 14:17.031
So the issue arises about the future of fiction, and there is a strong feeling amongst a lot of people that the future of fiction looks a little like games playing, and therefore it is instable, and it does

14:17.332 --> 14:25.163
have a lack of permanence in the sense that each text continues to develop as the games players play with it.

14:25.183 --> 14:37.180
But there's another kind of narrative art which exists inside the hypertextual medium that is itself

14:37.413 --> 14:38.314
a fixed entity.

14:38.855 --> 14:45.045
It's not read twice the same, either a print book.

14:45.065 --> 14:56.983
It's just, it exists as a whole finished and enclosed thing.

14:57.003 --> 15:06.357
One of the things we do about doing my hyper-picture, which are really focused on, not the games-playing metaphor, but upon

15:06.910 --> 15:16.346
traditional narrative metaphors, is to ask, how do you achieve organicity in the fluid medium?

15:16.366 --> 15:26.623
I mean, when you have a reader entering into your narrative space, there are so many possibilities of the way they can approach the text.

15:27.380 --> 15:38.017
How do you not having the support of the page turning mechanism create a feeling of an organic whole?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.519
This is a terrible challenge.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.401
It's not easy.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.624
Do people experience this today?

15:43.165 --> 15:49.455
Is there a reader of the future that has to be required to come along with the fiction of the future?

15:49.435 --> 15:53.441
I mean, are there people that enjoy this kind of reading experience today?

15:53.461 --> 15:54.583
Oh, yeah.

15:54.603 --> 15:56.626
In an artistic sense?

15:56.646 --> 16:00.271
I don't know how, I don't know how... A recreational sense.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.733
I'm wondering what it is.

16:01.853 --> 16:05.559
Well, most of it's recreational still.

16:05.579 --> 16:08.443
In terms of readers, I mean, not in terms of writers.

16:08.463 --> 16:09.184
The better writers.

16:09.324 --> 16:11.247
But then, that's true of books.

16:11.267 --> 16:12.529
I mean, it's true of books.

16:12.549 --> 16:18.818
I mean, all the great writers, few of the great writers I know have any audiences.

16:19.456 --> 16:31.893
And that's even true of great writers of the past, who've got a vertical audience through time and have got tremendous respect amongst a few people in each generation, but are not widely written.

16:31.913 --> 16:38.142
But Downey's still not a bestseller, and Shakespeare comes close in this country, but not in this other place.

16:38.202 --> 16:44.130
Cervantes, I mean, you can almost, there's almost no writer who at any given moment

16:44.212 --> 16:47.380
in time had so widely.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.547
A writer we would describe as a great writer.

16:50.748 --> 16:54.697
Well, the permanence of his text means something.

16:54.737 --> 16:58.265
A lot of permanent texts could just as well be done, as you know.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.651
A lot of crap that's kept as permanent texts.

17:01.272 --> 17:17.136
And it's kind of an awesome respect for the book that emerged out of the ways the book evolved out of the Middle Ages, out of the monastic libraries and secrets hidden away that one would anticipate existed in the book, where everybody could get their hands on it.

17:17.156 --> 17:24.968
You know, how the Book of Revelations might be really understood in the now contemporary language.

17:25.488 --> 17:28.275
the Kabbalah idea.

17:29.117 --> 17:42.750
And that awe of the terrible crimes and burning bones and so on that we feel is misplaced in a large sense.

17:42.791 --> 17:43.412
And a lot of

17:43.392 --> 17:54.537
We don't do it because we know nobody can make the judgment.

17:54.557 --> 18:00.490
What gets both is apt to pee the best stuff, rather not the worst.

18:00.655 --> 18:15.762
Well, except that there is a question that we don't.

18:15.862 --> 18:23.676
I mean, a lot of the storage we see

18:24.213 --> 18:32.867
We see data taken from some of these space poles at 115 years old and they can't even access it out because it's on magnetic plates that's deteriorating.

18:33.168 --> 18:35.752
But there is no guarantee that... No, there never is.

18:35.872 --> 18:36.493
There never is.

18:36.674 --> 18:38.076
I agree.

18:38.096 --> 18:44.787
All I meant was that the technology itself works

18:45.273 --> 18:48.636
as a more efficient library than the libraries do.

18:48.777 --> 18:51.039
That's what I mean.

18:51.439 --> 18:54.102
You're dealing with libraries.

18:54.182 --> 19:11.179
And that although, of course, they fail through everything, everything human fails, they have more of a chance of achieving those goals, those are desirable goals.

19:11.395 --> 19:17.906
I know there's a lot of problems.

19:17.966 --> 19:25.779
First, the main issue that we're bringing up at Brown Conference is standards, because one of the huge problems is changing standards.

19:26.460 --> 19:35.175
All the stuff I did outdoors, I've got to move out the windows.

19:35.392 --> 19:40.559
It'll eventually become more or less unreadable, even though it exists on disks, backup disks, and so on.

19:40.599 --> 19:48.088
People will have to find old programs that you can read them, which may not be easily accessible.

19:48.148 --> 19:50.331
It's like lost language or something.

19:50.351 --> 19:53.996
I need new kinds of translators.

19:54.977 --> 20:01.365
But one of the standards that was a kind of amazing standard, I remember

20:02.341 --> 20:19.537
I remember, fairly recently, it must have been, well, within the last five years or so, someone pointed out to me that ASCII, you know, is only like 20 years old or something like that.

20:19.557 --> 20:20.859
It's very recent.

20:20.879 --> 20:24.582
I mean, it's a really, really recent idea.

20:24.602 --> 20:25.223
And yet it's old.

20:25.743 --> 20:28.165
Yeah, it's the oldest thing we've got, really, in a way.

20:28.886 --> 20:31.909
And you worry that, what if suddenly that...

20:32.176 --> 20:33.998
were changed.

20:34.538 --> 20:39.883
If you moved from that to something else because something would be more efficient, what would be the consequences of that?

20:39.903 --> 20:45.369
And, of course, it would immediately make inaccessible just vast areas.

20:46.290 --> 20:51.234
It doesn't mean that you couldn't quite quickly translate everything into a new discard deal.

20:51.294 --> 21:00.343
That's one of the great advantages, that you don't have to—it doesn't have irreplaceable physical content.

21:00.948 --> 21:09.159
Its physical content, as with all digitized information, is in its reproduction.

21:09.179 --> 21:13.365
We will eventually digitize everything, smells and tactile stuff.

21:13.405 --> 21:23.178
So all of our sensual experiences can be in some manner digitized, but it only means that you put a code in that can somehow, something at the other end can actually translate that code back into the real thing.

21:23.779 --> 21:26.382
So that if you put in the note C,

21:26.733 --> 21:33.687
You know, in digitized form it comes out to be allowed to be some system that reads it and reproduces that sound.

21:33.787 --> 21:44.488
So anything like tactile experiences or anything that has to do with our information exchange can be digitized and reproduced, provided,

21:44.688 --> 21:46.811
at the other end there is something that can reproduce it.

21:46.831 --> 22:01.792
And that's always the difficult thing, why we do these complicated suits and glasses and so on for virtual reality, is because the hard part is not digitizing, but undigitizing, you might think, putting it back into something.

22:02.013 --> 22:08.502
So the problem of standards shifts and

22:08.752 --> 22:24.506
tape deterioration and so on, really is not an impossible one to answer because we're not dealing with objects that have to be in some way preserved for dealing with textual tape that that stuff is stored on.

22:24.586 --> 22:29.151
But basically we're dealing with something that can be translated quickly into any other kind of form.

22:29.171 --> 22:31.613
The term they use now is migration.

22:31.633 --> 22:36.177
Someone has to be sure that the migration

22:36.511 --> 22:37.192
take place.

22:37.212 --> 22:39.896
They say it's always zeros and ones.

22:40.196 --> 22:43.400
I looked at this at Cornell, and they're all hot shots up there.

22:43.521 --> 22:48.267
Well, in fact, hypertext began up there.

22:48.287 --> 22:49.309
Well, not hypertext.

22:49.349 --> 22:59.462
The real use of it became up there, because hypertext began with Ted Nelson, who came to Brown, actually, at a very critical moment in his career and in Brown's development.

23:00.284 --> 23:05.691
And he was brought there by a graphic man called Andrews Van Der, Andy Van Der.

23:06.380 --> 23:12.148
Andy was one of the early pioneers in computer graphics.

23:12.168 --> 23:20.460
And Nelson came and did a lot of research in hypertextual form.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.344
Have you read his work at all?

23:23.544 --> 23:26.548
No.

23:27.237 --> 23:30.321
I didn't bring along it.

23:30.401 --> 23:31.803
By email, I'll send you.

23:32.704 --> 23:38.912
Well, there's a conversation out on the web right now that I participated in.

23:38.932 --> 23:40.675
I participated in it.

23:40.695 --> 23:45.261
It was called, um, Rethinking Ted Nelson or something like that.

23:45.281 --> 23:47.103
And you're in this, yeah.

23:47.123 --> 23:50.988
So I'll send you the, uh, I'll send you the URL for that.

23:51.609 --> 23:53.432
It's Feed Magazine.

23:53.832 --> 23:54.132
Feed?

23:54.353 --> 23:54.773
Feed.

23:55.855 --> 23:56.215
F-E-E-D.

23:56.355 --> 23:56.856
Feed.

23:57.578 --> 24:06.675
And they deal with four concepts of his, his thinker toys idea and his links.

24:06.695 --> 24:11.744
He was the guy that developed the whole idea of hypertaxes, his invention of the word.

24:12.025 --> 24:15.351
He was a kind of 60s guru of all this stuff.

24:16.799 --> 24:30.451
But at Cornell is where they formed up this little group, that's where Stuart from Goldthorpe, I think, I don't know, Stuart, and Nancy Kaplan in her kitchen, who she now lives with Stuart, and the first gatherings of these people began.

24:31.873 --> 24:33.374
This is so important.

24:33.394 --> 24:40.441
Well, I'm writing about Cornell, and they just seem to come up in this context every place I turn.

24:40.461 --> 24:44.224
My son is a Cornell grad, so I got to know Cornell well.

24:44.710 --> 24:49.116
Nancy's now at Baltimore.

24:49.677 --> 24:54.364
She lives with Stuart Mouford, who's this hypertext guy.

24:55.606 --> 24:58.310
She's a very bright woman.

24:58.370 --> 24:59.792
Nancy Kaplan?

24:59.992 --> 25:01.755
Kaplan, yeah.

25:01.855 --> 25:03.157
At Hopkins, you said?

25:03.237 --> 25:07.663
No, at the University of Baltimore.

25:08.015 --> 25:11.278
Well, Stuart's there, too, and Stuart's very good to talk.

25:11.658 --> 25:16.762
I think Stuart's the wisest and most innovative of all the hypertext writers right now.

25:17.343 --> 25:21.506
Stuart Moultrop, M-O-U-L-T-H-R-O-P.

25:21.827 --> 25:33.076
This is his novel I talk about here, which I found much too academic, Victory Gardner, but he's moved away from that immensely, and he's working very vigorously out on the net, which is a hard thing to do.

25:33.597 --> 25:37.380
It's a very hard environment to work in, and he's really trying to

25:37.883 --> 25:41.268
trying to subvert and convert it.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.452
He's a very valuable novel.

25:43.472 --> 25:44.774
You've got how many novels here?

25:44.794 --> 25:50.182
You must have a pretty heady dozen, perhaps?

25:50.422 --> 25:53.828
More than that.

25:53.908 --> 25:56.652
What's the more exciting medium for you to write in now?

25:56.672 --> 25:58.054
Well, what really exciting talent is?

25:58.114 --> 26:02.541
There's not so much exciting involved in the ages.

26:02.757 --> 26:08.627
I tend to work on several things at once, and have done since I began writing.

26:08.647 --> 26:21.490
And it means that there are like 50 to 100 projects, unfinished all day, and they're all sitting there like ideas or paragraphs or chapters or something that should be to draw.

26:21.510 --> 26:26.959
What I was looking at now, I'm trying to work on a piece that I

26:27.597 --> 26:31.262
It began in 1969 when I moved here.

26:32.805 --> 26:40.716
And I just made a movie, a documentary film at Iowa on a confrontation in Iowa City.

26:40.736 --> 26:43.580
It had to do with the Vietnam War program.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.443
And this was in the 60s?

26:46.645 --> 26:48.087
Yeah.

26:48.303 --> 26:54.912
shot it all, and I had helped develop the film, and I had A and B wrote it, and I'd done it all.

26:54.932 --> 26:59.177
I just wanted to learn everything I could learn about filmmaking at that time.

26:59.197 --> 27:11.874
So I came away with a story idea, which I began then when I moved here, and interrupted it to work on a public burning, I thought, for six months, and, you know, five, six years went by.

27:13.156 --> 27:17.702
And then I would keep taking it with me everywhere I went, and working on it, but then something else would take over.

27:18.678 --> 27:23.827
I went to Venice with it, and Pinocchio at the Culver, and et cetera.

27:23.847 --> 27:30.238
As I brought it here again, now that's, you know, we're thirty years later, and I'm still working on this text.

27:30.258 --> 27:33.544
It's in the form of nine novellas, really, long novellas.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.347
It's about a pornographic film hero.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.511
Linked, to use a poem to it?

27:37.531 --> 27:38.733
No, not really.

27:38.753 --> 27:43.521
It's very narrative, very much a book narrative, in which

27:43.788 --> 27:54.530
This pornographic film he wrote, his whole life he lived in film, and the films, each of the time, made by a different woman filmmaker, so there's nine women living in film.

27:54.550 --> 27:57.055
And it's very hard work.

27:57.372 --> 27:59.535
It's very, very hard work to say.

27:59.555 --> 28:02.339
It's one reason I resisted all the time and do something else instead.

28:03.180 --> 28:10.530
But because I have so many of these sorts of things, it's never been a huge temptation for me to get into the writing of hypertext.

28:10.910 --> 28:11.911
I like teaching it.

28:11.931 --> 28:14.635
I like to see what happens to students' heads when they get into it.

28:14.675 --> 28:16.978
They become much better readers, much better writers.

28:16.998 --> 28:17.559
Do they?

28:17.579 --> 28:21.304
Oh, it transforms their perception of whatever.

28:21.284 --> 28:33.839
Back in the 60s, I used to teach a course, I still taught it right up into the late 80s, called Exemplary Ancient Fictions.

28:33.879 --> 28:44.271
We read Creation Myths and the Gilgamesh Epic and Enuma Elish and Book of Genesis.

28:44.774 --> 28:54.728
Greek stories and myths and Roman, all of its metamorphoses and folk tales and various things on them to medieval romance.

28:54.748 --> 28:58.413
And the whole idea of this thing was, it was a writing course.

28:58.673 --> 29:01.377
They had to do a certain amount of academic work, but they also had to do some creative work.

29:02.238 --> 29:11.811
The whole idea was to work with writers to help them understand narrative strategies that were pre-Servantes, as well as cutting off science.

29:12.095 --> 29:17.986
and to perceive the possibility of narrative beyond what was in those days the standard form.

29:18.227 --> 29:31.251
This was before Star Trek movies and there were a lot of things that might have inspired the imagination just weren't there and that we had these kind of dull and consistent repetitions of the past in terms of forms.

29:31.231 --> 29:38.640
And the inability to see, until we worked at it, how conventional the so-called well-made story or the novel was.

29:38.660 --> 29:51.455
I mean, it was not something that was natural, it was often felt to me, but depended, I didn't use the words in those days, but depended on book technology for the feeling of being in the right place, being the right thing for that medium.

29:51.475 --> 29:57.242
But we were working on forms that escaped this limitation.

29:57.262 --> 29:58.183
And those

29:58.872 --> 30:05.639
Ancient fictions we'd work all semester long, and only sort of in closing moments.

30:06.380 --> 30:08.242
Again, the light would begin to dawn.

30:08.482 --> 30:13.007
Something would begin to happen with the writing, which would escape this limitation.

30:13.047 --> 30:24.019
Undergraduates were quick to catch on, but the graduates were so ironclad already in their notion of what writing would be.

30:24.877 --> 30:28.003
I taught my first hyperfiction workshop in the first week it was over.

30:28.143 --> 30:30.026
I mean, that part was done.

30:30.046 --> 30:31.890
You just sat down and you started doing it.

30:31.910 --> 30:35.095
And wow, I mean, there was a sudden awareness about form.

30:35.276 --> 30:36.157
You start with nothing.

30:36.338 --> 30:37.360
So you have to build everything.

30:37.380 --> 30:38.542
You want in line, you've got to put it there.

30:39.483 --> 30:42.649
And the discovery of that, and the discovery, therefore,

30:42.629 --> 30:49.764
how reading was done, and how writing fed the reading, and how the form dictated both.

30:50.165 --> 30:56.318
Suddenly, the technology dictated the form.

30:56.737 --> 31:26.119
uh was suddenly transparent and so the the leap is sort of instantaneous and non-problematic then of course it becomes interesting well you know what's the wonderful thing about what are the great moments of your book reading life and are these gone if we're in this space or can we somehow find a way to to do the same thing here is it important and that's kind of the challenge of course i'm dealing with

31:26.555 --> 31:37.342
There are modest writers, students for the most part, and there have been no great writers yet working in hypertext, so dealing with people whose books I read them, I'd have mixed feelings about.

31:37.583 --> 31:38.726
We're not just talking about students.

31:38.746 --> 31:40.811
There have been no great writers yet.

31:41.172 --> 31:43.939
That's a market statement, right?

31:43.919 --> 31:48.805
In my second review, which you've read, I review, at that time, all the extensions.

31:49.686 --> 31:53.991
Nobody gets a big fuss.

31:54.031 --> 31:58.437
There's always a little twist at the end, even the positive reviews.

31:58.557 --> 32:01.721
But there's good stuff, there's good writing.

32:01.781 --> 32:06.086
As good as most stuff you'll find in books, we don't have a choice.

32:06.166 --> 32:10.011
Of course, Cervantes is 150 years after Gutenberg.

32:10.227 --> 32:21.241
It may take a while before we find the committed writer who is so engaged and so understands the medium and so lovely that writes the things that overwhelms us all.

32:21.261 --> 32:24.826
What would be the market genius in your view?

32:24.846 --> 32:25.787
I'm not for sure.

32:25.807 --> 32:29.132
Especially when you're engaging the participation of the reader.

32:29.152 --> 32:30.293
I can't say for sure.

32:30.794 --> 32:34.058
I know the things that have worked so far.

32:34.780 --> 32:39.033
but I had no idea what in the end it will be.

32:39.073 --> 32:43.947
One reason for that is that one of my fretting

32:44.197 --> 32:51.948
is the demotion of text itself, the diminution of its importance and power.

32:52.269 --> 33:03.585
And I'm struggling against that, but this may, in the future, look like a dinosauric struggle.

33:03.665 --> 33:10.575
It may be that all narrative in the future will be multimedia, and that this idea of text alone,

33:10.555 --> 33:18.864
will be an old-fashioned idea that will be revisited like a kind of scholarly or playful exercise.

33:18.884 --> 33:33.441
I hope, because what I feel to be the most interactive thing we do is look at those little squiggles on a page or a screen and convert them in archives into, you know, these

33:34.147 --> 33:49.030
landscapes and complex characters and all sorts of things that happen inside our heads just by reading these little coded things here.

33:49.050 --> 33:52.355
Just pulling a few of your words out of these articles.

33:52.735 --> 34:00.267
Fluidity, contingency, indeterminism, plurality, discontinuity are becoming principles of hypertext.

34:00.287 --> 34:02.550
And we are absolutely, there's a whole new

34:02.952 --> 34:06.560
Yeah, I'm not saying necessarily those are all positives.

34:06.580 --> 34:07.863
I'm saying that they're reality.

34:09.006 --> 34:18.868
And that therefore it's a little hard for me working pretty much in the old print medium to foresee in 1990s exactly

34:19.270 --> 34:24.257
what great narrative art's going to look like in this medium in years now.

34:24.297 --> 34:25.679
This is inevitable in your years.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.201
Oh yeah.

34:27.501 --> 34:28.663
Digitization is inevitable.

34:28.683 --> 34:35.572
I mean, the minute I understood digitizing, the minute I got a little glimmering of it, oh yeah, God, this changes everything.

34:35.592 --> 34:37.355
It's going to be a total revolution.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.376
It's so obvious.

34:39.082 --> 34:48.555
I mean, it may not be a revolution that lasts a million years, but it's certainly going to last for the next few hundred years, I'm sure.

34:48.575 --> 34:59.149
And that this characteristic, the characteristics of digital information,

34:59.264 --> 35:02.911
you have to be alert to and aware of to understand what's going to happen.

35:03.031 --> 35:16.217
And that's all I've been trying to do, most people have been trying to do, and there are a lot of prophets and a lot of people who have kind of convictions about what's going to happen, but so far I've not been convinced by anything yet.

35:16.257 --> 35:16.938
I don't see it.

35:17.339 --> 35:20.846
So what I work with, my students are traditional concepts.

35:20.906 --> 35:21.407
They're not

35:21.387 --> 35:25.454
They emerge from print, in fact.

35:25.475 --> 35:28.159
So we talk about voice, for example.

35:28.741 --> 35:31.886
Because voice seems to hold a hypertext together when nothing else does.

35:31.906 --> 35:40.442
If the thing is all fragmentary, at least convincing and compelling voice,

35:40.422 --> 35:45.859
a writer like Joyce, or working in this space, or Samuel Beckett.

35:45.919 --> 35:52.339
Just the texture of the voice itself would be compelling enough to convince the reader that it's worth

35:52.606 --> 35:56.952
carrying on through a space that is a little bit hard to map in his head.

35:56.972 --> 36:02.920
It's a little bit challenging to sense of, I don't know exactly where, I don't know what page I'm on, I don't know how much further I'm about to go.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.944
These are questions that you run into.

36:06.425 --> 36:15.357
And voice is a counterbalance against the feeling of this version

36:15.792 --> 36:21.202
That's a wonderful word.

36:21.402 --> 36:24.568
That's why.

36:24.588 --> 36:34.847
As I already mentioned, I'm already looking for what creates organic unity in a work that is not a linear text.

36:34.827 --> 37:00.112
One of the answers to that tends to be that the narrative tends to be looked at like a physical space, not something that is strung on a line, but something that exists here at the same time that exists here.

37:00.372 --> 37:01.613
And I'd like books to do it.

37:01.994 --> 37:03.535
If you reread a book,

37:04.122 --> 37:10.370
In the books you go back, going back to Ulysses and Don Quixote many times.

37:10.390 --> 37:13.274
I no longer go back to them from page one to the end.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.838
I go back to where I want to go.

37:15.998 --> 37:23.768
I know them well and I can go at any point in them and I can search out things and think about those aspects of that narrative.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.273
This requires a first reading, a prior reading.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.414
Yes, yes it does.

37:28.474 --> 37:34.700
But the fact is that it exists then in my mind as a landscape and not as a linear narrative as such.

37:34.720 --> 37:42.127
I mean, I understand the linear nature of it and that can be true although I also can understand its spatial aspect.

37:42.827 --> 37:53.097
So if I'm inventing a narrative in hypertext, I will tend to think of it in some way

37:53.448 --> 38:02.107
perhaps as a narrative that exists whole and instantaneously in space.

38:03.130 --> 38:04.673
There are ways in which you can

38:05.142 --> 38:09.309
important off-spaces that cannot be reached until certain spaces to the distance.

38:09.329 --> 38:16.841
So you can create a kind of limited sort of linear direction to something if you want and if you need it.

38:16.881 --> 38:17.462
Maybe you don't.

38:17.502 --> 38:19.966
Your memory doesn't need it.

38:19.986 --> 38:31.926
And the only way that the memory requires linearity, if it is a big geographical space, if you think back out of your past, if I asked you to tell me, you know, how did you get into

38:32.615 --> 38:34.698
How did you get into this work of writing?

38:34.758 --> 38:35.439
He's built the books.

38:35.599 --> 38:40.746
He wouldn't say, well, I was born in such and such a day, and I was born in a hospital or a hospital at some time.

38:40.766 --> 38:42.368
You don't start that way.

38:42.388 --> 38:45.933
You start, well, and you tell me an experience you had, and that experience leads to another.

38:46.534 --> 38:51.541
And even if you're telling me, you're probably thinking of other things you're not going to tell me, but a flash to mind is a result.

38:51.881 --> 38:55.746
This is all hypertextual experience.

38:55.766 --> 39:00.613
And so if students work in a space that has a kind of

39:01.100 --> 39:11.953
a spatial concept already, then it sometimes makes it easier to create a structure that has walls, that has limits, has a wholeness.

39:12.714 --> 39:14.556
And it doesn't matter if the reader explores it all.

39:14.576 --> 39:24.188
I don't need to explore the entirety of your memory, nor do you for that matter, to arrive at a rather full understanding of you or of

39:24.438 --> 39:33.630
whatever the issue is or whatever the story is we're talking about.

39:34.170 --> 39:40.639
All reading experiences are, by their nature, linear.

39:41.219 --> 39:44.804
The linear experience is imposed upon this way willy-nilly.

39:44.824 --> 39:49.450
You can't escape the way we live in common.

39:49.717 --> 39:54.645
the way we approach a narrative is to step into it at a certain moment and leave it at a certain moment.

39:54.665 --> 39:58.391
And in this process, as this process unfolds, it's a linear experiment.

39:59.533 --> 40:11.091
Even though what we're doing is drifting perhaps through a geographical landscape in which the choices we make are our own about how we're going to go through it.

40:11.111 --> 40:14.577
That aspect of it, that paradox,

40:14.742 --> 40:22.798
as it can be part of the narrative itself, and it becomes as it was in Don Quixote, become an element.

40:22.959 --> 40:29.252
But Don Quixote exists and enjoys as a discrete, complete, unchanged work.

40:29.272 --> 40:30.033
Right.

40:30.073 --> 40:32.178
Well, it's kind of hypothetical.

40:32.198 --> 40:34.843
It can also exist as complete and unchanged.

40:35.093 --> 40:40.140
I mean, in fact, if you buy any of these discs by Michael Joyce, they are what they are.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.423
You put the disc in, you read it, and you put and take the disc out.

40:42.443 --> 40:43.124
It's like having a book.

40:43.885 --> 40:46.549
It's just that the book doesn't have page-turning mechanisms.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.711
It has a different kind of mechanism.

40:47.731 --> 40:54.360
But we talk about the hypertext, but we also talk about the experience of engaging the reader to develop their own scenarios.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.243
That's a different kind of writing.

40:56.263 --> 40:57.945
That's why I was saying it.

40:58.229 --> 41:04.139
There are those who see it as a kind of games playing and believe that all the great fiction in the future will have this characteristic.

41:04.160 --> 41:17.303
It will be a huge mass of databases in which the writer enters into the database and creates their own narrative that we're out of the potential that's there and structures those elements and adds elements as they want to.

41:17.343 --> 41:21.891
That's the kind of Dungeons and Dragons way of going at fiction.

41:22.293 --> 41:25.218
That's not the only way that it's being done, at least at this time.

41:25.238 --> 41:27.121
What happens to the future, I can't say.

41:27.141 --> 41:33.131
At this time, I see the likelihood that the author, far from being dead, is very much alive.

41:33.772 --> 41:43.288
The author is going to become, in some respects, like a film director, in that it will require additional talents to fulfill everything he wants to do in the narrative.

41:43.673 --> 41:56.349
so that if you want a graphic material, if you want sound, if you want some other things in it, voiceover, whatever, you're going to have to get some other talent to help you out.

41:56.369 --> 42:03.098
But it's still going to be your work, and it's probably, probably, you're not going to allow tampering.

42:03.138 --> 42:03.499
Probably.

42:03.519 --> 42:04.740
You're not going to allow tampering.

42:04.760 --> 42:05.481
That's essential.

42:05.601 --> 42:07.304
It may or may not be.

42:07.364 --> 42:08.365
I mean, some people,

42:08.699 --> 42:11.585
I think it's kind of fun, the idea of opening up.

42:11.605 --> 42:13.049
And they may write something that's very exciting.

42:13.069 --> 42:17.859
Some people being the reader, but how about the creator who wants to have it?

42:17.879 --> 42:22.489
There are creators who like the idea that, please, get in here and change all this and rewrite it.

42:22.509 --> 42:25.155
And they provide what you might call a

42:25.642 --> 42:32.992
a playground or a jungle gym, something that kind of framework that you can play around on.

42:33.012 --> 42:34.714
You can do your own kind of stuff.

42:34.734 --> 42:36.156
You can invent stuff.

42:36.176 --> 42:37.098
But what endures?

42:37.198 --> 42:37.758
What endures?

42:37.839 --> 42:45.269
I mean, if we define an age by cultural achievements, that we can see.

42:45.289 --> 42:52.999
Yeah, but how do you know from something that one of these interactions is magnificent, but it only exists at one time?

42:52.979 --> 42:54.702
Maybe I'm missing something here.

42:54.722 --> 43:00.431
Well, that may be the nature of the age and what makes it great, viewed from a certain angle.

43:00.471 --> 43:07.322
It may be seen that this appetite for permanence and so on is a perverse appetite.

43:08.043 --> 43:10.407
It's been with us for thousands of years.

43:10.427 --> 43:13.131
Yeah, finally reshending it, you know, finally getting rid of this thing.

43:13.111 --> 43:15.877
and understand life as it really is lived.

43:15.997 --> 43:21.167
I'm just giving an argument, being devil's advocate.

43:21.288 --> 43:25.777
I'm still basically a book writer and reader.

43:26.318 --> 43:32.029
It's just that I don't have any hostility to all of this.

43:32.450 --> 43:34.815
So I feel comfortable.

43:34.795 --> 43:37.038
I don't feel uncomfortable.

43:37.438 --> 43:41.623
I actually am sort of playing around with the hypertext.

43:41.643 --> 43:49.633
But even as I'm doing it, I'm simultaneously doing it in a linear form.

43:49.673 --> 43:51.455
Did you bring some examples of hypertext?

43:51.475 --> 43:52.937
Did you mention that you might?

43:53.678 --> 43:57.443
Well, I have disks, but I have only my copies.

43:57.503 --> 43:59.245
I should have copied them.

43:59.265 --> 44:00.246
It's all on Macs.

44:00.732 --> 44:02.096
And I'm working on PCs.

44:02.116 --> 44:03.479
I've always worked on them.

44:03.519 --> 44:04.903
The stuff on Macs I've got at home.

44:04.923 --> 44:06.908
But I could have sent to you anything you wanted.

44:07.309 --> 44:07.590
Really.

44:07.911 --> 44:13.465
And by the way, I would be happy to show you the quotes.

44:13.626 --> 44:16.092
I've got problems showing you.

44:16.392 --> 44:24.660
subjects, what I've written before I use it in a great attempt to make sure we get it right.

44:24.941 --> 44:28.104
You've not looked at any of these guys yet?

44:28.124 --> 44:30.166
At people like Joyce and Wolfram.

44:30.186 --> 44:31.207
Joyce, I haven't.

44:31.387 --> 44:35.852
I've got the hypertext book, of course, Landau's book.

44:36.833 --> 44:42.018
Well, George, Landau is a great enthusiast.

44:42.098 --> 44:44.661
He's one of these guys who just has this kind of wonderful

44:44.843 --> 44:59.511
uh optimism about the form that it's fun to quote it because it's full of the hyperbolic uh anticipation but um but he's not a writer
