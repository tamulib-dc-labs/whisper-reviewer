WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:04.693
We're talking to Dr. Hannibal Benz.

00:05.354 --> 00:06.897
If you don't mind my English.

00:07.297 --> 00:08.920
And just tell me your name for the tape here.

00:09.641 --> 00:10.943
My name is Kai Sprenger.

00:10.963 --> 00:11.844
And spell it, please.

00:12.705 --> 00:18.234
You spelled it... K-A-I and then S-P-R-E-N-G-E-R.

00:18.394 --> 00:18.774
Good.

00:19.876 --> 00:20.757
Well, this is huge.

00:20.998 --> 00:30.612
You know, that it started with using just images, and then from these images, the idea of the meaning was more...

00:30.929 --> 00:38.858
became a more abstract one, and then letters, and from that I think that that's developed.

00:38.878 --> 00:43.043
And that's what I'm showing here.

00:43.063 --> 00:47.468
The first, let's say, cuneiform.

00:47.768 --> 00:49.410
Cuneiform, right.

00:49.430 --> 00:49.891
Yeah.

00:49.911 --> 00:54.676
And this, uh, um, aerobic.

00:54.877 --> 00:57.780
No, your English is excellent, by the way.

00:58.165 --> 00:59.207
Thank you.

00:59.227 --> 01:08.907
And to contrast this in a way, the very beginning of the history of writing, we would like to contrast this with some piece of modern art, you know, like that.

01:09.067 --> 01:09.749
This is from 1980.

01:10.811 --> 01:12.254
Now, these are all authentic pieces.

01:12.554 --> 01:14.679
Some of them, but some of them are copies.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.280
These are authentic.

01:17.251 --> 01:30.457
And this is interesting because it gives you an idea for what purposes they used writing, and then you have at least two fields.

01:30.477 --> 01:39.394
You have the field of religion, liturgical texts, and you have to remember what they

01:39.830 --> 01:45.276
And in this form we have some sort of a nail.

01:45.817 --> 01:51.543
It's like a document that had been laid down in the fundamental building.

01:51.783 --> 02:01.294
And this document tells you the date when the building was erected, under which ruler, and whose reign, I guess.

02:02.315 --> 02:03.156
And that's authentic?

02:03.196 --> 02:04.378
That's authentic.

02:04.938 --> 02:05.719
Those are wonderful.

02:06.323 --> 02:10.307
So these are all purchased with funds that the museum has that the city makes.

02:10.787 --> 02:17.334
A lot of this must be gifts to everything.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.435
Good.

02:18.455 --> 02:26.503
And here we come to the, let's say, because you're interested in the book, you know, the development of the form of the book.

02:26.523 --> 02:31.448
The first form of the book were these tablets.

02:31.468 --> 02:32.689
Clay tablets, I think.

02:32.709 --> 02:34.491
Clay tablets, yeah.

02:34.977 --> 02:38.161
And, of course, they were absolutely secure.

02:38.181 --> 02:39.743
They couldn't be fortificated.

02:40.424 --> 02:46.412
Because once they had been burned in the oven, you couldn't change the writing anymore, unless you broke it.

02:48.055 --> 02:50.498
This was one form of the thing.

02:50.518 --> 02:51.139
Security.

02:51.179 --> 02:53.442
Yeah, the book, you know, in inverted commas.

02:54.417 --> 02:55.418
The book of saying what?

02:55.479 --> 02:56.420
What did you say?

02:56.520 --> 02:57.041
In what?

02:57.121 --> 02:59.604
Well, I think a book is a book.

02:59.664 --> 03:01.607
A book contains information.

03:01.707 --> 03:02.989
What is that kit there?

03:03.049 --> 03:10.500
This is from the 18th century that gives you an example of Coptic writing.

03:10.540 --> 03:20.414
And Coptic is a form of writing which developed as a mixture of the Euroclific writing mixed with ancient Greek writing.

03:21.095 --> 03:23.158
And the Coptic writing is the

03:23.324 --> 03:28.852
the writing of the Egyptian Christian people, let's put it this way.

03:28.932 --> 03:35.541
And what is that little kit back there, that little pouch?

03:35.802 --> 03:38.325
Yeah, the leather thing.

03:38.426 --> 03:42.151
And this is where this little manuscript has been stored, you know, covered.

03:42.211 --> 03:51.424
It's sort of book-covered together, and how the liquor of the plant itself functioned like some sort of glue.

03:58.897 --> 04:15.938
Here it comes from different forms of paper, how paper is produced, how paper was invented, and for what different objects, apart from the books of course, paper is used today.

04:16.499 --> 04:26.912
As you can see, for example, these are different water slides, but these paper objects,

04:27.398 --> 04:53.608
to say modern art, or toys, or bookbinding, paper to write on, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover, paper to cover.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.545
Well, how do you explain why you think that will happen?

05:05.585 --> 05:06.726
So what are we looking at here?

05:06.766 --> 05:11.631
This is the little book plates, we call them.

05:12.772 --> 05:16.296
To show you whose book it is.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.482
Yeah, I never thought of that.

05:22.642 --> 05:29.029
Even if the book, even if the text is printed 5,000 times in the very same text, you know,

05:29.853 --> 05:58.932
every book has its own individuality by these book plates because if you open the book and you can read this book belongs to William Morris or to whoever the print text which you can find over and over again many thousand copies gains some individuality and I don't know how this idea is going to be conveyed by using digital books

05:59.300 --> 06:02.444
Maybe there's a... It's an interesting... I had never thought of it.

06:02.464 --> 06:03.946
It's a very interesting concept.

06:03.966 --> 06:04.506
It really is.

06:05.447 --> 06:05.948
It really is.

06:06.729 --> 06:08.932
These are letters.

06:09.212 --> 06:10.293
Yeah, Korean letters.

06:10.414 --> 06:11.074
Korean letters.

06:12.336 --> 06:19.725
As I mentioned before, the Korean people were very, very modern.

06:19.745 --> 06:28.075
As early as the 14th century, they were printing books by the means of single, multiple types.

06:28.493 --> 06:35.323
But there was one difference compared to Gutenberg's concept.

06:37.766 --> 06:44.736
Gutenberg used single movable types cast out of metal types.

06:45.537 --> 06:48.221
And that's what the Korean people did as well.

06:48.842 --> 06:54.210
But Gutenberg combined this invention, this method, with a printing press.

06:55.672 --> 06:57.775
And the Korean people

06:58.278 --> 07:23.172
used another way they had these single metal musical types as well and they were putting them together and composing some type of text then they were inking the text and then they were wrapping the paper with a brush or some wooden tube they were not using the press you know to print it actually and that was that

07:27.978 --> 07:34.168
And this, of course, is an engraving of a Korean print shop, I guess.

07:38.815 --> 07:41.098
These are the composers.

07:42.861 --> 07:47.829
Composers, using the single types, composing the text.

07:47.849 --> 07:50.373
And here we have those printers in a way.

07:51.274 --> 07:56.162
They ink the composed text.

07:56.952 --> 08:16.512
and then they flush the paper over the .

08:16.732 --> 08:16.832
Okay.

08:18.093 --> 08:21.897
Okay, we're now in what we think might have been

08:22.197 --> 08:29.367
This is a creative reconstruction of Gutenberg's printing shop.

08:29.387 --> 08:33.312
Because we always ask, but how do we know Gutenberg?

08:33.332 --> 08:45.268
We have some illustrations, which you can see on the wall here, and the earliest illustration showing a printing shop in the late 15th century, you can see on the right.

08:45.653 --> 08:48.517
dates to the year 1499.

08:48.777 --> 08:55.826
And this conveys the idea how it might have looked like, you know, a printing shop in good luck style.

08:55.846 --> 09:05.038
And we have no original material left, we have no original wooden locks, we have no original metal types.

09:05.459 --> 09:07.622
This is all a reconstruction.

09:07.742 --> 09:08.262
What are these?

09:09.464 --> 09:11.847
This is...

09:12.299 --> 09:17.987
to just regulate the... Oh, it's kind of like a shot, it's like an absorber almost, yeah.

09:19.489 --> 09:20.711
And I'll show you how it works.

09:22.153 --> 09:34.551
Of course, this is not how Gutenberg did it, you know, because every day we have demonstrations here, and to make it a bit easier for us, we're using these blocks here.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.615
But I'll show you how Gutenberg did it.

09:42.117 --> 09:44.881
Where did he mold the type, do you think?

09:45.121 --> 09:45.361
Yeah.

09:48.325 --> 09:50.267
And you do that here too as well, right?

09:50.287 --> 09:52.771
Yes, I can.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.933
Maybe we have to wait a bit till it's hot.

09:57.036 --> 09:59.840
And what do you call this?

10:00.020 --> 10:00.921
It's a forge?

10:00.941 --> 10:02.123
An oven.

10:02.663 --> 10:02.984
An oven.

10:04.225 --> 10:07.990
But we don't know the consistence of the metals we use.

10:08.510 --> 10:13.277
Definitely he did not use only lead, because lead is very smooth metal.

10:13.877 --> 10:21.368
And if he had used only lead, the lead letters would have bent out of the printing process.

10:21.528 --> 10:23.391
So he needed an alloy of some sort.

10:23.411 --> 10:23.811
That's it.

10:24.332 --> 10:32.163
And it's quite likely that he mixed some sort of antimony bismuth and tin and lead.

10:32.703 --> 10:37.470
Because I'll show you when it's hot.

10:37.703 --> 10:41.188
how quickly this, how it solidified.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.553
Solidified within a second to a... Wow.

10:46.336 --> 10:48.159
He really had to do a lot of work, didn't he, huh?

10:48.740 --> 10:49.301
Yeah.

10:49.321 --> 10:58.114
I mean, in terms of figuring out... And of course, that looks like a pretty, an old case that you must have gotten out of some shop.

11:01.139 --> 11:03.222
This is really something, I have to tell you.

11:17.782 --> 11:29.837
That means in order that people thought, well, this is handwritten, this is like a manuscript, like the usual form they were used to to read manuscripts or texts.

11:30.558 --> 11:37.967
And if you have a look at the outward appearance of the typography, of the writing,

11:38.234 --> 11:42.759
It's very similar to the handwriting of that period, very similar.

11:43.239 --> 12:00.178
You can only see the very same forms and shapes of the different letters, but also the abbreviations, the combinations of letters were the very same which had been used in the manuscripts of that time.

12:01.159 --> 12:02.000
Let me have a look here.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.242
You can see some manuscripts.

12:07.529 --> 12:14.359
Look at that.

12:15.721 --> 12:17.263
It's incredible.

12:17.724 --> 12:18.906
Absolutely magnificent.

12:19.026 --> 12:22.371
This is from Gutenberg's time in the 1440s.

12:22.751 --> 12:27.679
And if you look at the shape of the letters, it's quite similar to very similar stories.

12:28.259 --> 12:30.362
And that is handwritten?

12:30.923 --> 12:31.444
Yes.

12:31.812 --> 12:45.474
I can't imagine, that's why I'm going up to St.

12:45.594 --> 12:51.043
Gollum.

12:53.607 --> 12:59.136
I want to see how they do it.

12:59.285 --> 13:02.229
This is for me, that's fascinating.

13:02.249 --> 13:09.019
And if you keep in mind, this form, the shape of the letters is very similar to a cuckoo lamp.

13:09.800 --> 13:16.770
But if you look at this, you can see that it's very beautifully composed in a way.

13:16.890 --> 13:21.176
You don't have white spaces, irregular white spaces.

13:21.697 --> 13:23.299
The lines are all regular.

13:23.319 --> 13:26.524
They are not jumping around.

13:26.774 --> 13:31.923
The margin is one straight line, it's not jumping around either.

13:32.483 --> 13:40.276
So Gutenberg put a lot of work in the sense of aesthetic work into that.

13:40.637 --> 13:45.405
When you look at the end of every line, somebody else has pointed, he never hyphenated the last line.

13:46.407 --> 13:53.338
Somehow he managed to set up the type, so you never had a hyphenated word at the end of a column.

13:53.622 --> 13:56.686
At the very last line of the poem.

13:56.706 --> 13:58.047
That's true, at the very last line.

13:58.068 --> 13:58.949
That's true, yeah.

13:59.790 --> 14:02.233
So this was very... Brilliant.

14:02.453 --> 14:05.877
Brilliant and a lot of work to measure everything.

14:06.117 --> 14:07.339
And this is 42 lines.

14:07.679 --> 14:08.400
This is 42 lines.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.863
Because some of his Bibles actually had 40 lines.

14:11.084 --> 14:18.433
Some, not the whole Bible, but... Yeah, the point is that, of course, the Bible was not printed in one day, you know.

14:18.453 --> 14:22.718
And some of the pages have only 40 lines and some have only 41.

14:22.968 --> 14:28.776
So you can, looking at this, you can see that during the process of work... They were changing.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.638
They were making adjustments.

14:30.678 --> 14:31.540
Yeah, adjustments.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.162
They had to, you know.

14:33.182 --> 14:42.955
And you could probably date, not date, but you can probably calculate where a Bible was in the press line, whether it was an earlier one or a middle one or a later one.

14:42.975 --> 14:43.416
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.436 --> 14:50.325
We can differentiate different steps of the printing of the Bible, different...

14:50.677 --> 14:55.685
By studying all of the Bibles, of course, which is very important.

14:55.825 --> 14:57.287
And this is volume one.

14:57.307 --> 14:59.932
That's the Old Testament volume?

15:00.092 --> 15:00.352
Yeah.

15:00.573 --> 15:02.335
And this would be the New Testament volume?

15:02.355 --> 15:02.756
That's true.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.058
Do you have two Gutenberg Bibles?

15:04.098 --> 15:05.080
We have one and a half.

15:05.981 --> 15:16.718
Because a complete Gutenberg Bible consists of 1,282 pages, which are usually bound into two volumes, usually.

15:17.288 --> 15:21.393
Since we have three Bible volumes, we have one and a half.

15:21.794 --> 15:24.757
These two volumes here belong to each other.

15:24.777 --> 15:27.441
They form one complete Bible.

15:27.681 --> 15:29.764
And what is the binding?

15:30.665 --> 15:31.927
The binding is not contemporary.

15:31.947 --> 15:35.751
The binding is 18th century now.

15:35.771 --> 15:38.575
So this is not contemporary to Gutenberg's time.

15:39.136 --> 15:46.485
But the binding of that example is on one volume of at least two that form a complete Bible.

15:46.769 --> 15:49.613
The binding of that volume is contemporary to Gutenberg's times.

15:49.633 --> 15:51.296
Now look at the illuminations here.

15:51.476 --> 15:52.438
These are magnificent.

15:53.540 --> 16:00.490
Although I have to say that the illuminator, and this is because I was introduced, the illuminator couldn't read it in Latin.

16:01.011 --> 16:14.312
That's what we can say, because if you look at the text, the Latin text, you have some sort of prologue, and you have the Bible text, the holy text, in a way, you know?

16:14.680 --> 16:18.665
And of course, the text of the Bible is much more important.

16:18.805 --> 16:27.777
And illuminating the initials, the artist should consider the different quality of the text, of course.

16:28.177 --> 16:28.958
But he did not.

16:29.298 --> 16:31.181
The illumination was more or less the same.

16:31.301 --> 16:38.450
This illumination is as beautiful and as brilliant, let's put it this way, as the other one.

16:38.851 --> 16:41.374
And he didn't care what the text was about.

16:41.394 --> 16:42.375
It just saw, well,

16:42.592 --> 16:45.335
There's a space left for me to illuminate.

16:45.355 --> 16:45.656
He's an artist.

16:45.676 --> 16:47.458
And I'm an artist, so I illuminate this.

16:47.898 --> 16:52.964
And this gives us some idea, looking at these details, how actually the book was produced at that time.

16:52.984 --> 17:01.574
It wasn't that people bought a book in the shop like we do today, you know, illustrated, illuminated, bound, everything ready, you know, wrapped in.

17:02.075 --> 17:03.256
You bought it in sections.

17:03.276 --> 17:04.238
You bought it in sections.

17:04.298 --> 17:07.922
You bought more or less the printed paper.

17:07.942 --> 17:09.824
And then you decided on the binding, the art.

17:10.044 --> 17:10.845
That's it.

17:11.006 --> 17:12.227
They would trim the pages.

17:12.477 --> 17:21.319
Were there places on the press, I don't want to go back down, there were pinholes, they used to say they used to pin the press down, the paper down?

17:21.680 --> 17:22.923
Yeah, you can see these.

17:23.024 --> 17:28.798
If you look very, very carefully, on the very top you can see some

17:29.048 --> 17:32.371
What is that writing at the very top of the page?

17:32.652 --> 17:38.498
The very top of the page is handwritten to give a mark to the bookbinder and know what's next.

17:38.518 --> 17:39.879
So that's also contemporary?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.221
It's also contemporary, yeah.

17:41.241 --> 17:41.781
It's in ink?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.184
That's ink, yeah.

17:44.204 --> 17:48.909
And this is written with ink and it says Prologos.

17:49.249 --> 17:56.997
So this was to show the replicator, the person who wrote or who painted the red color.

17:57.449 --> 17:59.452
what words to write.

17:59.993 --> 18:00.774
Like this, you know.

18:00.794 --> 18:02.216
Directions to the rubricator.

18:02.236 --> 18:02.437
Yeah.

18:03.779 --> 18:07.504
And there were also some directions to the bookbinder, as you can see here.

18:08.386 --> 18:16.799
But usually after the binding or while the process of bookbinding, it has been cut away.

18:17.339 --> 18:21.406
And you can see these small words in the margin.

18:22.207 --> 18:26.173
This is handwritten with ink and show the bookbinder what

18:26.423 --> 18:27.144
Fascikel?

18:27.384 --> 18:28.245
You say fascikel?

18:28.265 --> 18:28.806
Faxical.

18:28.986 --> 18:29.547
Faxical.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.470
What faxical to bind next?

18:32.071 --> 18:43.005
Because it is the beginning, the word of the next page, or some sort of numeric numeration to show the bookbinder what's next.

18:43.025 --> 18:48.192
Do you change the pages around often, or do you leave them open to the same pages in the exhibition?

18:49.254 --> 18:50.796
Sometimes we will change.

18:51.717 --> 18:53.359
Which is very important, I think.

18:53.963 --> 18:57.268
The apography is quite obvious, as you mentioned earlier.

18:57.789 --> 19:01.054
It's very smooth, it's brilliant.

19:01.074 --> 19:01.695
It's clean.

19:01.955 --> 19:02.376
It's clean.

19:02.476 --> 19:05.380
It looks really like one piece of art.

19:05.400 --> 19:11.710
But of course, Kuhnberg did not achieve this mastery overnight.

19:12.070 --> 19:14.834
So he had to experiment quite a lot.

19:14.854 --> 19:20.022
We have one very small fragment that gives an idea.

19:21.588 --> 19:26.553
What lay in between the very beginning and this mastery?

19:26.573 --> 19:30.036
If you have a look at this fragment on the left side, look at the lines.

19:30.316 --> 19:31.817
Oh, look at that.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.520
We call that the Weltgerichtfragment.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.342
It's a fragment from the world's final judgment in a way.

19:38.984 --> 19:40.926
And it's before 1450.

19:41.226 --> 19:44.669
It's printed before 1450.

19:45.090 --> 19:49.073
We don't know whether it's been printed in Strasbourg or Mainz.

19:49.353 --> 19:51.055
There's much, much...

19:51.524 --> 19:53.266
debate on this fragment.

19:53.726 --> 20:03.316
But it's commonly accepted, more or less, that it's printed by Gutenberg, even if we don't know the idea.

20:05.519 --> 20:06.299
Because of the type?

20:06.360 --> 20:07.841
Because of the time, that's right.

20:09.463 --> 20:10.184
How about the paper?

20:11.024 --> 20:11.685
It's parchment.

20:12.326 --> 20:14.768
It's parchment.

20:14.848 --> 20:16.350
Oh no, sorry, this is paper.

20:18.102 --> 20:23.427
But I mean, is it similar to the other papers that we used?

20:23.487 --> 20:24.888
Yeah, yeah.

20:24.908 --> 20:26.149
They're uneven, yeah.

20:26.209 --> 20:30.673
It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, about eleven lines, right?

20:30.693 --> 20:33.896
Yeah, but this is only a fragment because of the harmony of the binding.

20:36.959 --> 20:38.140
Amazing, isn't it?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.241
Yeah.

20:39.261 --> 20:42.463
And if you have a look at the space... Where was it found in the binding?

20:42.704 --> 20:43.104
Can we go?

20:43.825 --> 20:44.685
Where was it found?

20:45.846 --> 20:46.607
How recently?

20:46.807 --> 21:16.577
um it's quite old i mean it's found this century beginning of the century well this is the 1459 yeah well the first edition was in 1457 right and this is the second edition which is we're only slightly older and um here we have the first time ever a print book printed

21:17.047 --> 21:19.870
three different colours at one time.

21:22.453 --> 21:28.279
Red, blue and black.

21:28.339 --> 21:29.120
The 1459?

21:29.320 --> 21:29.440
Yeah.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.563
Also the 1457.

21:32.703 --> 21:33.224
That's amazing.

21:38.770 --> 21:43.695
And the type is definitely different.

21:45.177 --> 21:48.190
I would like to find an original title, but just one.

21:49.717 --> 21:50.460
One piece, right?

21:50.641 --> 21:51.947
Just one piece.
