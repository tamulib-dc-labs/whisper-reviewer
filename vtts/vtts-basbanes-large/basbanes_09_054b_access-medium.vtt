00:03.018 --> 00:15.470
What prompted you to become a political reporter, so to speak?

00:15.570 --> 00:19.474
I've been looking for a way to do an American travel book.

00:19.514 --> 00:23.337
That's how it started.

00:23.978 --> 00:27.181
I didn't want to go out on the road.

00:27.241 --> 00:31.405
I wanted to go out with some particular purpose and with a narrative logic.

00:31.604 --> 00:33.946
other than me just touring around.

00:34.527 --> 00:37.890
And then it fell into my lap.

00:37.910 --> 00:43.115
I mean, the editor of the New Republic called and said, you want to go come to the campaign for us?

00:43.135 --> 00:43.475
That's it.

00:43.615 --> 00:44.536
That's how I'm going to do it.

00:44.556 --> 00:45.957
Did he mean the entire campaign?

00:46.818 --> 00:55.106
I think, you know, when he called, I think he meant to go up to New Hampshire or Iowa and see, you know, after Iowa and write us a few pieces.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.066
But, but.

00:56.267 --> 00:59.129
Yeah, because the campaign, you know, you're talking about America.

00:59.149 --> 01:00.270
Yeah, no, I know.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.071
But we were,

01:01.760 --> 01:17.177
But he had agreed, and I said, well, look, I don't really have that much interest anymore in doing pieces about it because this is a frame for something I've long wanted to do.

01:17.817 --> 01:19.319
How do you feel about it?

01:21.341 --> 01:22.923
Were you thinking book at this point?

01:23.043 --> 01:24.745
Oh, yeah, instantly.

01:24.765 --> 01:29.590
In fact, I thought of it, I was serializing the book as I wrote it.

01:30.245 --> 01:35.935
which is one of the reasons why I was so insistent about keeping my characters in it even after they've lost.

01:36.115 --> 01:37.017
And this was a war.

01:37.217 --> 01:39.000
It was very funny.

01:39.020 --> 01:41.845
The new public readership saved me.

01:42.065 --> 01:45.992
No editor in his right mind would print material about

01:46.833 --> 01:48.816
Maury Taylor in June.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.538
In June.

01:51.760 --> 01:57.869
But the readers, the letters from the readers were, where's Maury?

01:58.490 --> 01:59.471
Let them go lie about Maury.

01:59.531 --> 02:00.713
Forget about the campaign.

02:00.773 --> 02:05.720
There were so many of those sort of letters that they backed me up.

02:05.740 --> 02:06.321
To the New Republic.

02:06.341 --> 02:07.303
Yeah, to the New Republic.

02:07.583 --> 02:08.585
They backed me up.

02:08.605 --> 02:13.712
And they pulled me in somewhat on the subject of Maury.

02:13.772 --> 02:14.794
But they saw the point.

02:14.854 --> 02:16.536
They saw that

02:16.735 --> 02:19.420
you couldn't really write about the 96 campaign.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.406
I mean, to write about the 96 campaign, well, you had to not write about it.

02:23.426 --> 02:28.595
You had to find some counterpoint, because it didn't describe itself.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.580
It needed a foil, and Morley was the foil.

02:31.861 --> 02:36.188
What are the demos on the readers who are responding to Morley, just out of curiosity?

02:36.208 --> 02:36.890
What do you think?

02:36.910 --> 02:41.798
The young reader or the disenchanted reader?

02:42.520 --> 02:46.046
I imagine it's a mixture.

02:46.266 --> 02:59.649
The only answer I would have for that is that when you went to rallies, when you went to these people's rallies, you were seeing sort of different slices of the political marketplace.

02:59.669 --> 03:03.516
A certain kind of person went to a Buchanan rally, a certain kind of person went to a Forbes rally.

03:04.053 --> 03:10.845
And the kind of person who turned up at a Maury Taylor rally were people who were generally not that interested in politics.

03:10.865 --> 03:13.429
I mean, the people who were sort of disengaged.

03:13.449 --> 03:17.816
And the kind of letters I got were usually from people who were just readers.

03:18.478 --> 03:20.261
They didn't have a point.

03:20.681 --> 03:22.264
They didn't think of...

03:22.902 --> 03:28.158
They weren't thinking like, they didn't have the op-ed mentality.

03:28.418 --> 03:30.745
They didn't live for the abortion cause.

03:30.805 --> 03:31.768
They weren't cause people.

03:31.788 --> 03:32.470
They were readers.

03:33.092 --> 03:37.485
And there were women especially like them.

03:37.972 --> 03:40.294
I met a lot of letters from women about Maury.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.978
But that's priceless stuff.

03:44.118 --> 03:48.382
People saying that they're never going to vote again unless Maury Taylor runs.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.725
People, you know, you get letters on... They're never going to what again?

03:51.825 --> 03:53.987
They're never going to vote again unless Maury Taylor runs.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.568
That kind of stuff.

03:55.689 --> 03:56.670
Very funny things.

03:57.931 --> 04:00.293
Remember the Pat Paulson running for president thing?

04:00.333 --> 04:00.753
Yeah.

04:00.813 --> 04:02.095
I mean, totally off the wall.

04:02.855 --> 04:03.176
Yeah.

04:03.276 --> 04:04.817
Did he ever take himself seriously?

04:05.598 --> 04:06.299
Pat Paulson?

04:06.319 --> 04:06.819
No, your guy.

04:06.839 --> 04:07.860
Oh, yeah, completely.

04:08.296 --> 04:13.969
Oh look, you've got to understand that when he started,

04:14.438 --> 04:19.144
I mean, he really has this reputation in Midwestern manufacturing circles.

04:19.164 --> 04:21.587
He's a miracle worker, a real miracle worker.

04:21.787 --> 04:22.909
He's a poor boy.

04:22.929 --> 04:23.530
He's made himself.

04:23.550 --> 04:31.600
He's going to be worth a billion dollars one day, and it's going to be done in a way that it's actually, it's the acceptable face of capitalism.

04:31.620 --> 04:36.426
This man is creating jobs for his workers, and he has a relationship with his workers.

04:37.167 --> 04:40.432
How old is he here?

04:40.872 --> 04:41.593
52.

04:42.097 --> 04:46.902
When he went down to that Perot convention and talked to them, they picked him up.

04:46.962 --> 04:49.384
They put him on almost every ballot in the country.

04:49.625 --> 04:55.530
And he had, in many ways, a more legitimate presidential campaign than Graham or Lamar.

04:55.550 --> 04:58.674
I mean, he had a national organization without very much money.

04:58.734 --> 05:00.676
I mean, a relatively little money he didn't spend.

05:00.956 --> 05:02.437
And his own money, as you point out.

05:02.537 --> 05:03.238
And his own money.

05:03.398 --> 05:07.142
And Graham spending so much on other people's money.

05:07.122 --> 05:12.007
But the more he spent a quarter of the grand spent and outperformed it.

05:12.027 --> 05:26.941
And I guess he thought that there was, you know, once he refused to be handled at all, once he refused to read a speech and refused not to say that last little thing that was on his mind, he was doomed.

05:27.522 --> 05:30.985
But there was a brief period when he was always doomed.

05:31.046 --> 05:32.207
Yeah, he was always really doomed.

05:32.227 --> 05:34.589
But he might have had a little bit of a gutter around him.

05:34.609 --> 05:35.610
Let's be, let's be.

05:36.350 --> 05:40.300
No, but I mean, he was doing total obscurity.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.207
I mean, look what Steve Forbes did.

05:44.230 --> 05:49.042
You can't tell me that Steve Forbes was a more legitimate character than Morris.

05:49.062 --> 05:50.626
Well, what did Steve Forbes do?

05:50.666 --> 05:51.428
Did he ever have a prairie now?

05:51.448 --> 05:53.413
Well, it depends on who you talk to.

05:53.393 --> 06:04.153
The consultant class in Washington will tell you that they think that had he handled a little bit differently the last few weeks of his campaign, he could have won the nomination.

06:04.173 --> 06:06.217
I mean, money was absolutely no object.

06:06.397 --> 06:06.597
Yeah.

06:07.659 --> 06:08.541
Money was no object.

06:08.561 --> 06:10.885
If money could have bought it, it would have bought it in that case.

06:10.925 --> 06:14.071
But my point is not that he would have become president.

06:14.191 --> 06:15.233
My point is that

06:15.787 --> 06:20.853
If Morrie had handled it a little differently, he might have been the Forbes character.

06:20.873 --> 06:25.618
He might have been the person who... His name might fall off of more people's tongues.

06:25.678 --> 06:26.359
That kind of thing.

06:26.379 --> 06:27.100
That kind of thing.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.622
We all do know who Steve Forbes is.

06:29.643 --> 06:29.743
Yeah.

06:29.763 --> 06:32.125
I'm not so sure so many people know who Morrie is.

06:32.145 --> 06:32.926
Oh, no.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.248
No, that's a great... To this day.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.469
That's the great picture of him.

06:35.489 --> 06:38.132
When I opened this thing, I said, what the hell is he writing?

06:39.074 --> 06:41.321
I mean, I'm a pretty savvy reader.

06:41.581 --> 06:43.908
I got a New York Times and Wall Street Journal here.

06:43.928 --> 06:50.046
I read these papers, and I had to dig back into my trunk card because I really felt like...

06:50.667 --> 06:55.115
You needed to engage a reader with a subject, to engage me with a subject.

06:56.056 --> 06:58.801
You had to come at it in an unexpected way.

06:58.821 --> 07:04.991
And I thought it was wonderful that you're opening a book on an Isaacs campaign, and the first candidate you meet is Maury Taylor.

07:05.853 --> 07:08.577
You're not sure whether you're reading fiction or nonfiction.

07:08.657 --> 07:12.844
Well, it's good also because I think it has absolutely established the tone of this book.

07:12.905 --> 07:13.165
Yeah.

07:13.685 --> 07:15.227
This is not the boys on the bus.

07:15.467 --> 07:15.687
No.

07:17.409 --> 07:25.078
You know, and it's not David Golder telling us, giving us the campaign... It's not a pundit.

07:25.098 --> 07:26.419
It's not a pundit book.

07:26.439 --> 07:27.300
And you're not a pundit?

07:27.420 --> 07:27.740
No.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.305
What are you, as a matter of fact, what you say?

07:32.326 --> 07:35.689
I get in trouble deciding whether I was a Democrat or a Republican the whole time.

07:36.010 --> 07:37.491
Well, I didn't mean politically.

07:37.531 --> 07:40.154
I mean, what are you in terms of... I don't think of myself as a writer.

07:40.254 --> 07:40.535
Okay.

07:40.555 --> 07:42.797
You know, I think of myself as someone who's trying to write...

07:43.300 --> 07:50.268
non-fiction narrative books and drag readers where they don't think they're going to go.

07:50.468 --> 07:58.677
I mean, the great pleasure of a lot is poker is dragging all these people who think they would never read a book about business or finance into Wall Street and teaching them about it a little bit, giving them some idea.

07:59.538 --> 08:06.806
And I was hoping that I could do this with this process in a way it's more important.

08:09.830 --> 08:12.092
So I think of it, no, I think of myself as a

08:12.258 --> 08:14.240
as the generalist.

08:18.004 --> 08:21.808
My ambition when I was through this was never to write another book about politics again.

08:21.828 --> 08:22.589
That may change.

08:23.129 --> 08:36.263
But there's always this desire in the part of the world to professionalize you, to make you more of what you've been and keep you in your niche.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.948
I'd rather just be an amateur.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.749
So, I think of myself as an amateur and a writer.

08:46.472 --> 08:51.417
So, did a good part of this book appear in magazine form?

08:51.477 --> 08:56.362
Or were they basically five-finger exercises for setting up, you know, the book?

08:56.662 --> 08:57.403
Combination.

08:57.823 --> 09:00.526
And this is a practical thing.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.949
About half of it ended up in the New Republic.

09:04.830 --> 09:05.631
As we read it here?

09:05.651 --> 09:07.213
Yeah.

09:07.573 --> 09:08.314
Or changed.

09:08.474 --> 09:10.276
All of it was edited.

09:10.536 --> 09:11.577
All of it was edited.

09:11.557 --> 09:14.420
But does this bother you?

09:14.480 --> 09:17.463
I'm thinking for my own personal reasons here now.

09:17.804 --> 09:24.130
Are you concerned that maybe the readers of the magazine are going to say, I read this before they appear fresh to them?

09:24.430 --> 09:24.851
Oh, no.

09:24.971 --> 09:25.672
I have letters.

09:25.792 --> 09:30.897
I have a stack like that of letters from people who wanted me just to reprint the new publications.

09:30.917 --> 09:31.258
Okay, good.

09:31.278 --> 09:32.219
What's the first printing of this?

09:33.400 --> 09:36.383
You know, they said 100,000, so what does that mean?

09:36.363 --> 09:39.166
Maybe 50 or 60.

09:39.967 --> 09:42.770
With the presses at the ready.

09:48.116 --> 09:58.168
What I did is I took the New Republic's truck and it came to about 80,000 words and I cut out about 20,000 of that.

09:58.537 --> 10:02.583
and just dropped it and then reshaped the rest of the material.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.847
It came out and then built it back up to twice that size.

10:06.688 --> 10:11.055
But it was a fun experiment.

10:11.235 --> 10:21.729
It was an old-fashioned experiment that novelists used to do, is trying to write a book about a subject that's happening before your eyes in a serial form.

10:21.750 --> 10:27.818
I mean, you could pick characters and develop them over the course of ten months.

10:28.321 --> 10:30.025
Tell me what I did in my book, by the way.

10:30.105 --> 10:31.167
That's what I'm bringing.

10:31.428 --> 10:31.588
Really?

10:31.608 --> 10:31.789
Oh, yeah.

10:32.209 --> 10:37.741
I basically went out as a reporter in public stories that happened.

10:38.062 --> 10:38.222
Right.

10:38.443 --> 10:39.405
Auctions in New York.

10:39.445 --> 10:40.728
We covered all the big auctions.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.951
A trial in Iowa.

10:42.011 --> 10:44.135
I went and covered the trial and carried the guy.

10:44.336 --> 10:48.625
You know, the book thief, the greatest book thief of the 20th century.

10:49.111 --> 10:51.035
the Haven O'MoR story over there.

10:51.055 --> 10:54.803
This was basically a story that I investigated and followed.

10:54.823 --> 10:56.266
And you found your characters.

10:56.286 --> 10:57.729
Oh, and they are characters.

10:57.769 --> 11:03.340
They absolutely belong to me, as far as I'm concerned, as characters.

11:04.028 --> 11:09.436
I don't want this on tape if you're writing punditry.

11:09.716 --> 11:14.563
If I was writing punditry, it would be that letter by the time you were ready to publish.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.907
Who wants to read a reprinted op-ed piece?

11:18.468 --> 11:26.319
But because these were stories and characters that were going to be developed further, it felt very organic taking it into a book.

11:26.419 --> 11:30.525
But more importantly, from the point of view of trying to explain to people what this book is,

11:31.484 --> 11:37.632
The world is set up for a certain kind of political book.

11:38.834 --> 11:46.625
And when you go on Inside Politics on CNN, they really want you to be as a pundit when you come on and talk about your book.

11:46.985 --> 11:53.114
And they keep trying to shove the book, make the book that sort of thing, which this is not.

11:53.134 --> 11:55.357
And it's against that in a way.

11:55.957 --> 12:00.023
And having put some of it in the magazine where Judy Woodruff read it,

12:00.745 --> 12:13.303
is saving me, because she understands that she would never read that time to read the book before I came on to go, this political person is going to tell us why Dole won, or Dole lost, or why Clinton won, or whatever they're going to do.

12:13.463 --> 12:16.107
And let's be clear that you don't do that at all.

12:16.127 --> 12:17.349
I don't do that at all.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.133
And you probably don't have, you know, a professional clue.

12:20.153 --> 12:23.458
I don't have... You don't know as much as, you know... Yeah, the next guy.

12:23.478 --> 12:24.199
The next guy.

12:24.219 --> 12:26.382
And I sort of feel that, I feel that

12:26.362 --> 12:37.774
is generally true about these people who are on the talk shows on Sunday morning that all the prognostication and that they don't have a clue either.

12:37.794 --> 12:53.871
You know, I mean, I always thought those shows would be better if they had, you know, cab drivers on them or just ordinary people off the streets because the idea of professionalizing political futurology or, you know, or even worse, the sort of business of

12:54.307 --> 12:58.797
saying what America thinks with $275 million.

12:59.118 --> 13:01.022
It's not what I do.

13:01.804 --> 13:11.505
And so it's been helpful that some of it's been read by the people who interviewed me because it enables them to slightly adjust their approach to it.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.750
It enables me to get into what the book really is.

13:14.793 --> 13:18.743
It's an attempt to look at political life, but just a little differently.

13:19.605 --> 13:22.312
Do they find it refreshing the pundits that you've met?

13:22.573 --> 13:24.778
So far, I haven't met with any hostility.

13:25.059 --> 13:26.984
I expect I will at some point.

13:27.024 --> 13:29.771
Where do you think the hostility is?

13:29.811 --> 13:31.114
Here's the hostile take on it.

13:31.820 --> 13:32.641
What?

13:32.741 --> 13:34.263
It's a fun book.

13:34.283 --> 13:36.286
How can you get angry about it?

13:36.306 --> 13:41.052
There are all sorts of people who don't feel like having fun.

13:44.276 --> 13:53.068
The serious response, if this book does really well, I can promise you this piece will be written.

13:53.403 --> 13:58.167
Mr. Lewis doesn't even, it's not even clear whether he's a Democrat or a Republican.

13:58.287 --> 14:00.389
We don't learn anything about welfare reform.

14:00.649 --> 14:05.613
You know, we don't learn anything, you know, he's not interested in the details of legislation.

14:07.275 --> 14:12.379
What they will do is challenge its seriousness on the grounds that it's fun.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.023
And, well, is it serious in your view?

14:17.063 --> 14:18.284
It is serious in my view.

14:18.304 --> 14:22.768
I feel like, I feel like, and that's probably what about liar poker, that

14:23.221 --> 14:24.643
Humor is not unserious.

14:24.783 --> 14:26.044
Humor is a very serious thing.

14:26.645 --> 14:37.298
It's a tool, I mean, in addition to being a source of pleasure, it's a tool for approaching and enlivening a subject.

14:37.318 --> 14:43.626
And it's serious in the sense that you can attempt

14:45.260 --> 14:51.889
to seriously undermine the slick, professional, political campaign, and try to show it for what it is.

14:52.710 --> 14:55.514
And the only way you could do that would be reference to something else.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.540
It's like you can't understand what a bad painting is unless it's a good painting.

14:59.620 --> 15:05.408
It's to bring people who aren't taken seriously by the political process into it.

15:06.089 --> 15:11.537
Do you think it's a 1990s take on the selling of the president in Louisville McGuinness' book?

15:12.310 --> 15:13.672
The book that made Joe McGinnis.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.956
It's an attempt to move the genre forward.

15:17.037 --> 15:21.883
I really thought that there was a chance to move the campaign book genre forward.

15:21.903 --> 15:26.309
And there's this long... It starts with Teddy White, right?

15:26.390 --> 15:30.756
Teddy White through McGinnis and Hunter Thompson and Tim Krause.

15:31.076 --> 15:32.218
Tim Krause's book I loved.

15:32.238 --> 15:33.379
Yeah, it was a wonderful book.

15:33.539 --> 15:40.169
But since then, there hasn't been... There haven't been campaign books that I thought were really alive.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.170
That last one...

15:41.723 --> 15:42.865
Richard Ben Cramer.

15:42.885 --> 15:43.546
Oh, it was terrible.

15:43.586 --> 15:44.267
The doorstop.

15:45.709 --> 15:46.130
It was terrible.

15:46.190 --> 15:47.071
It was impenetrable.

15:47.712 --> 15:49.735
They allowed him to totally indulge him.

15:49.755 --> 15:50.877
We're talking a record.

15:50.897 --> 15:53.040
Yeah, it was a thousand pages.

15:53.280 --> 15:59.009
Yeah, without an index, which was arrogance beyond... There was no index?

15:59.049 --> 16:00.071
By direction.

16:00.091 --> 16:00.972
Oh.

16:00.992 --> 16:05.779
He said, I do not want people just picking it up and looking for themselves in the book.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.642
And he ordered them not to do an index.

16:08.143 --> 16:08.203
Oh.

16:08.723 --> 16:13.128
And I think that was, I think that was devastating.

16:13.148 --> 16:16.272
I mean, because it's also, it's also, it's inexcusable.

16:16.653 --> 16:18.235
I'm not sure anybody really read that book.

16:18.255 --> 16:19.777
Few people have too.

16:20.157 --> 16:23.141
Not only did they not read it, but I think they didn't even read parts of it.

16:23.281 --> 16:23.441
Right.

16:24.002 --> 16:31.091
Because at least, I mean, they were, they were now unable to go even, even go in and find themselves that they were interested in.

16:31.211 --> 16:33.314
So, I never read it.

16:33.394 --> 16:36.958
I tried, but I turned down, totally turned down an opportunity to interview the guy.

16:37.377 --> 16:39.984
Because I said, I'm not going to read this goddamn thing.

16:40.184 --> 16:41.809
This is a lot of work here.

16:41.829 --> 16:43.774
You have to read 100 pages on Joe Biden.

16:43.794 --> 16:44.335
Is that what?

16:45.298 --> 16:46.742
Did you read the book?

16:46.762 --> 16:47.664
I read parts of it.

16:47.684 --> 16:49.007
I mean, I kind of flipped through it.

16:49.028 --> 16:50.251
And this is not for quotation.

16:50.291 --> 16:51.133
I'm just curious.

16:51.637 --> 17:18.218
anyway so so so i think that particular election didn't have any didn't have a book no and neither did the last one and neither did which and the last one should have actually yeah probably should have it's a pretty interesting election yeah but you know it's funny the the inherent interest of the election doesn't seem to be related to the quality of the books that come out of it if you think about it there was the 70 i guess the 72 election was interesting simply because watergate was happening

17:18.198 --> 17:28.153
But the books that came out of it, Boars on the Bus and Fear and Loathing, I Can't Dangerous, they don't even mention Worriedly.

17:28.254 --> 17:35.565
I think what makes these books, when they work,

17:35.883 --> 17:40.772
It's something about the relationship between the process and American life.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.557
And they're getting at something.

17:43.597 --> 17:46.301
And in this case, it was the total juncture.

17:46.321 --> 17:49.106
It was, you know, less than half the people voted.

17:49.126 --> 17:50.950
It was extraordinary.

17:51.290 --> 18:00.186
And the people who voted, and this is the thing that is so hard, you can't even say on a pundit show, is that the people who voted,

18:00.892 --> 18:03.378
It's always assumed that those who voted, voted passionately.

18:03.718 --> 18:04.781
It means something.

18:05.342 --> 18:09.391
We can read their votes as saying something larger about what Americans think and believe.

18:10.193 --> 18:16.808
But I think that when people voted this time, it was like the decision between

18:16.788 --> 18:18.771
going to see Die Hard 2 in Waterworld.

18:19.012 --> 18:29.329
I mean, a vote can be a very shallow thing, cast out of guilt because, you know, you vote habitually, you're proud you vote, but not because you actually passionately, someone is passionately speaking for you.

18:29.770 --> 18:35.138
And I don't think, I think that I would get the vast majority of you.

18:35.158 --> 18:39.005
The Clinton crowd's greatest fear was voter empathy, that they wouldn't vote.

18:39.265 --> 18:39.566
Yeah.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.711
And that was, and that, and in Congress, that was the dole's

18:43.602 --> 18:50.435
crowd's biggest hope is that the hardcore Republicans are going to come out and maybe we'll sneak through them.

18:50.616 --> 18:50.816
Right.

18:51.217 --> 18:56.267
But the funny thing is the hardcore Republicans who would come out didn't particularly care at all.

18:56.527 --> 18:58.030
It was just the lesser of two evils.

18:58.391 --> 18:59.373
Yeah, and he was a nice guy.

18:59.413 --> 19:02.339
I mean, I thought he was a nice guy.

19:02.359 --> 19:02.559
Yeah.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.463
But isn't it extraordinary the way

19:04.443 --> 19:08.007
The campaign made him so much less of a nice guy.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.090
I mean, his personality shines through more in a Visa commercial.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.033
You just took the words out of my mouth.

19:13.473 --> 19:14.995
These commercials are wonderful.

19:15.675 --> 19:17.137
This guy is funny.

19:17.177 --> 19:18.759
Why does this guy run for president?

19:18.779 --> 19:19.920
I just can't win.

19:20.601 --> 19:21.782
That's a great line.

19:21.802 --> 19:23.744
Got some ID.

19:24.005 --> 19:24.806
Oh, great.

19:25.086 --> 19:25.486
Wonderful.

19:25.807 --> 19:30.592
Why couldn't that same group that did that ad do his campaign?

19:30.932 --> 19:31.513
Handle them.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.982
It's easy to say.

19:33.002 --> 19:37.750
I love the fact that you're conceiving this as a travel book.

19:37.930 --> 19:40.594
My new book, I conceive it totally as a travel book.

19:40.614 --> 19:40.875
Really?

19:41.436 --> 19:45.122
A travel book to libraries through history.

19:45.182 --> 19:45.983
It's boring.

19:46.003 --> 19:48.287
It sounds totally boring, doesn't it?

19:48.267 --> 19:51.391
But if you go to, excuse me, I'm going to get the vacant look.

19:51.411 --> 19:51.972
No, no, no, no.

19:51.992 --> 19:53.113
I love the vacant look.

19:53.173 --> 19:55.236
I love the vacant look.

19:55.276 --> 19:56.818
I don't understand what you're saying.

19:56.838 --> 19:57.699
Well, I'll do a word.

19:57.719 --> 19:59.882
Let's finish talking about it.

19:59.902 --> 20:04.508
Because really, if we were here to talk about this, I need some more quotes here.

20:06.690 --> 20:11.997
The book speaks for itself, but let's talk a little bit about Liar's Poker and how that, you know...

20:12.854 --> 20:16.659
how that developed, what you were doing prior to the writing of that book.

20:16.679 --> 20:19.023
I mean, I don't think you were all... Working at Salomon Brothers.

20:20.404 --> 20:27.995
You're not a writer by original... Well, I knew that's what I wanted to do about my freshman year in college.

20:28.075 --> 20:29.397
Which is where, by the way?

20:29.597 --> 20:30.038
Princeton.

20:32.341 --> 20:32.641
Uh-huh.

20:32.721 --> 20:33.883
But I also thought...

20:34.522 --> 20:38.168
I was alienated from the writerly crowd at Princeton.

20:38.188 --> 20:41.653
They all wore kind of black turtlenecks and smoked off in the corner.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.979
It was a clique, and I never really liked cliques.

20:45.999 --> 20:46.721
What was your major?

20:47.321 --> 20:49.705
Art history.

20:49.725 --> 20:50.046
Interesting.

20:50.546 --> 20:51.929
A neutral kind of a major.

20:52.850 --> 20:55.234
Considering the two fields that you went into.

20:55.354 --> 20:56.395
Well, you know what?

20:56.415 --> 20:59.500
Art history has been very useful to me because it teaches you to look.

21:00.239 --> 21:08.170
I mean, in learning to look at paintings, it's helped me look at, I mean, it was wonderful for this, because it was staged tableau.

21:08.631 --> 21:12.156
The Dan Quayle thing is priceless.

21:12.256 --> 21:14.880
Always waving at nobody.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.464
And why are the cameras always sucked in?

21:17.524 --> 21:19.386
Why don't they do a pan around the scene?

21:19.446 --> 21:23.212
Because they're not rewarded for entrepreneurship or ingenuity.

21:23.232 --> 21:25.555
They're rewarded for not screwing up.

21:25.906 --> 21:26.968
like the candidate.

21:26.988 --> 21:33.383
Everybody in this process is rewarded for not screwing up, which is why it's got this horrible, riskless feeling to it.

21:33.403 --> 21:35.908
And that's all about taking risks.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.093
You've got to take risks.

21:38.374 --> 21:41.080
But nobody at the center of it really wants to take a risk.

21:41.060 --> 21:44.865
I'm going back to teaching you to look.

21:45.106 --> 21:48.851
But art history was useful, very useful in that way.

21:48.951 --> 21:56.862
In fact, you'll find, I'm surprised by the number of writers I run across who have some art historical training.

21:56.882 --> 22:02.090
Bruce Chatwin, another person who would often talk about his art historical training.

22:02.370 --> 22:04.893
That's very interesting.

22:05.194 --> 22:10.982
You know, this is my greatest weapon, I think, in my eyes.

22:12.380 --> 22:14.262
They developed that.

22:14.663 --> 22:19.629
So you're talking about seeing things or actually seeing textures as well?

22:19.870 --> 22:37.432
Seeing compositions, colors, especially when what you're seeing has been organized for your eyes, like a political campaign.

22:38.033 --> 22:39.194
You think about it.

22:39.535 --> 22:40.716
Maybe it's this.

22:41.641 --> 22:55.988
that one of the things you do in art history in just kyle's art history courses is you stare at a painting for an hour or two hours to find interesting things to write about even when nothing initially occurs to you and sometimes you learn that sometimes

22:56.390 --> 23:00.595
that it's in the second hour that all of a sudden something happens.

23:01.396 --> 23:05.982
And sometimes it's the simplest thing.

23:06.102 --> 23:14.892
I remember with Donatello's David, the effeminate bronze.

23:14.912 --> 23:23.663
I was writing about Donatello and thinking about, I was going to make the argument that here was Donatello, he revived, it wasn't original, he revived,

23:24.065 --> 23:26.389
The freestanding nude.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.756
This is the first nude statue in early Renaissance sculpture.

23:32.839 --> 23:33.580
Something was wrong.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.904
I couldn't see out what was bothering about it.

23:35.924 --> 23:37.367
I looked and looked.

23:37.527 --> 23:38.569
It has a hat.

23:39.230 --> 23:39.871
It has little boots.

23:40.271 --> 23:41.053
It's not nude.

23:41.453 --> 23:42.134
It's not nude.

23:42.335 --> 23:44.037
It's just that the genitals are displayed.

23:47.102 --> 23:48.705
He was not...

23:49.124 --> 23:53.171
It was not a slavish copy of an antique form.

23:53.191 --> 23:57.438
It was something that there was an original dimension to it.

23:57.458 --> 24:00.343
But it was something that, I mean, a very simple and obvious thing.

24:00.723 --> 24:03.768
But you learn that there's a benefit to staring.

24:04.329 --> 24:07.875
I guess that's what it is.

24:08.176 --> 24:15.445
But in any case, I found myself alienated from the riderly crowd, not particularly feeling like I fit in with them.

24:15.486 --> 24:16.687
And this is when?

24:16.707 --> 24:18.309
In Princeton.

24:18.329 --> 24:19.491
About when?

24:19.671 --> 24:21.794
In the early 80s.

24:22.435 --> 24:23.156
The 80s.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.059
Graduated when?

24:26.079 --> 24:26.220
82.

24:27.061 --> 24:28.923
About 35, I guess.

24:29.264 --> 24:29.644
36.

24:30.367 --> 24:43.820
And the other thing that always bothered me about, one of the things that bothered me about the crowd, about the notion of what writers were, is that their ambition was to go and write novels right after they got out of college.

24:45.541 --> 24:46.202
Without any experience.

24:46.222 --> 24:46.823
Without any experience.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.624
And I thought, you know, Christ, what do you write about?

24:48.724 --> 24:51.967
The writers, and the journalist profession does this too.

24:52.028 --> 24:55.651
Sends people to journalism school, and they don't have any experience of anything else.

24:55.671 --> 24:58.674
And I thought, go find things and go learn things.

24:58.754 --> 24:59.935
Go, you know, mix it up.

25:00.421 --> 25:05.030
And I worked in an art dealership in New York, and then I went and worked as a woodworker.

25:05.311 --> 25:05.932
Where in New York?

25:05.952 --> 25:07.154
Soho?

25:07.335 --> 25:11.223
It was a gallery called Wildenstein, which is on the Upper East Side.

25:11.403 --> 25:15.651
It was all master paintings.

25:15.671 --> 25:22.024
I wasn't that interested in contemporary painting at the time.

25:22.527 --> 25:31.398
And then decided that I really had to know more about economics and went and studied economics for a couple of years in London.

25:31.418 --> 25:32.860
The London School of Economics.

25:34.022 --> 25:37.085
And ended up landing this job at Salomon.

25:37.105 --> 25:39.589
They didn't send me a bio on you.

25:39.609 --> 25:41.351
But it was all, no, that's all.

25:41.471 --> 25:42.732
It was all to a purpose.

25:42.753 --> 25:51.083
It was all kind of thinking, well, one day, I started writing magazine articles when I got out of college.

25:51.603 --> 25:55.648
You know, it was ejected for a year and then things started to fine print.

25:56.149 --> 26:12.210
And the experiences were all, I mean, I needed to make a living, but it was also, in the front of my mind, was you've got to see the way the world is.

26:13.118 --> 26:19.187
My magazine career sort of started to take off when I was in the Solomon Brothers, which was 86, 87.

26:19.567 --> 26:25.856
The New Republic and a couple of the Spectator.

26:25.996 --> 26:28.820
And you were just a kid.

26:28.980 --> 26:32.445
And I seemed that I could make a living.

26:32.465 --> 26:33.747
I couldn't make a living.

26:33.767 --> 26:38.374
I was making the Solomon Brothers out of it, but I could get by.

26:38.414 --> 26:40.136
And what were you doing at Solomon Brothers?

26:40.156 --> 26:40.797
Selling bonds.

26:41.806 --> 26:50.001
And so I quit the job at the Bolleman Brothers, and it seemed the obvious thing to do was to write a story, write a book about that experience.

26:50.281 --> 26:51.584
People were obsessed with it.

26:51.604 --> 26:54.148
There was a market for it, and I was interested in telling it.

26:54.168 --> 26:55.190
The time was perfect.

26:55.270 --> 26:59.818
It was the timing for the public, and that book could not have been better.

27:00.079 --> 27:00.980
End of 89.

27:01.622 --> 27:02.984
The end of the era, sort of.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.248
Exactly.

27:05.414 --> 27:12.445
In my book, I started with the last great auction of the 80s in November of 89, and it was the last great gasp.

27:12.585 --> 27:12.826
Really?

27:12.846 --> 27:14.108
It was perfect.

27:14.128 --> 27:16.071
I mean, what a metaphor for the 80s.

27:17.413 --> 27:18.956
Did the prices fall after that?

27:19.897 --> 27:22.541
It wasn't so much that the prices, the market fell.

27:22.621 --> 27:23.443
Everything fell.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.928
People spent ten times as much for books as they should have.

27:27.549 --> 27:27.910
Right.

27:27.930 --> 27:31.936
This guy spent $2.1 million for the Shakespeare's, and they were expecting to bring in half a million.

27:31.956 --> 27:32.417
Really?

27:32.802 --> 27:41.892
And then when the guy went under, a guy you might have heard of on Wall Street, Richard Manning, he went under.

27:42.252 --> 27:45.876
Funny guy, I have a chapter on him.

27:45.896 --> 27:49.821
Apparently, Sultipides had loaned him money to violate Shakespeare.

27:49.841 --> 27:50.862
They did that with a lot of people.

27:50.882 --> 27:54.386
So they called in their chits, and so he had to sell his whole library.

27:54.786 --> 27:56.128
And guess which books didn't sell?

27:56.168 --> 27:57.409
The Shakespeare's.

27:58.030 --> 28:00.033
They couldn't even get a million dollars for them.

28:00.053 --> 28:04.641
Finally, they sold them privately for a million out to Southern California.

28:05.502 --> 28:09.208
But my point is, yeah, they were vastly overpaid.

28:09.228 --> 28:11.252
So, anyway, I'm sorry.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.173
There are parallels.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.375
It couldn't have been better.

28:13.816 --> 28:17.382
Did you have any thought that this book was going to be what it was?

28:18.043 --> 28:20.106
I mean, I thought that they would be interested in it.

28:20.508 --> 28:26.800
Given the interest in the 80s and the interest in the few things I put in magazines.

28:27.261 --> 28:29.244
The magazines are very useful.

28:30.867 --> 28:34.574
It helped me with this.

28:34.614 --> 28:38.040
It gave me the courage of my conviction.

28:38.061 --> 28:40.725
It told me that go with Maury Taylor.

28:40.826 --> 28:43.731
You've got a whole readership out there that understands what you're trying to do.

28:43.711 --> 28:56.720
And so when it comes time to write the book, you know that there are people who are waiting to hear what you have to say.

28:56.740 --> 28:57.602
No, I didn't have.

28:57.802 --> 29:06.077
You can't predict that a book will sit for 42 weeks on the Times bestseller list.

29:06.117 --> 29:06.998
You just can't do that.

29:08.601 --> 29:13.249
I thought there was a chance they might make it a bestseller because they thought so.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.353
Who was the publisher of it?

29:15.373 --> 29:15.513
Morton.

29:15.533 --> 29:17.557
That's why you asked about Morton.

29:17.577 --> 29:18.679
They must have been thrilled.

29:19.368 --> 29:20.129
No, they were.

29:20.269 --> 29:24.176
I mean, Norton books, they've never had that experience before.

29:24.416 --> 29:27.200
They do with Patrick O'Brien, who does very well.

29:27.240 --> 29:27.561
Yeah.

29:27.601 --> 29:30.065
But not at those levels.

29:30.085 --> 29:31.227
Vincent Bugliosi.

29:31.567 --> 29:32.789
Well, that was 20 years ago.

29:32.809 --> 29:35.373
Yeah, that was the last time they'd had that kind of experience.

29:36.094 --> 29:36.234
Yeah.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.798
And they haven't had it probably since, you know.

29:39.519 --> 29:40.040
No, they haven't.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.122
I like Norton.

29:41.142 --> 29:41.843
I like them a lot.

29:42.003 --> 29:42.524
Yeah, I do, too.

29:42.544 --> 29:43.386
They're very high-quality.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.507
Very nice people, too.

29:45.168 --> 29:46.270
They love my book.

29:46.722 --> 29:52.169
My book is a Norton kind of book.

29:52.209 --> 29:52.689
Yeah, it is.

29:52.849 --> 29:53.871
Anyway, it was a Norton book.

29:53.891 --> 29:54.932
I didn't realize that.

29:55.032 --> 29:56.754
They like books at Norton.

29:56.774 --> 29:58.456
A lot of publishers don't like books.

29:58.476 --> 29:58.917
No, they don't.

29:58.937 --> 30:00.499
That's why I love my house.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.162
I'm so thrilled that they read.

30:03.522 --> 30:04.223
They love books.

30:04.423 --> 30:07.427
That could have sold on the scope of my book.

30:07.808 --> 30:08.669
Let's go back on it.

30:08.689 --> 30:10.811
I just need to transcribe myself talking.

30:10.831 --> 30:13.995
It was really nice.

30:16.304 --> 30:20.661
Did you feel any anxiety doing this book after?

30:21.063 --> 30:24.926
You did have another book in between, right?

30:25.046 --> 30:25.727
And a collection.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.248
It's a collection of journals.

30:27.328 --> 30:29.010
So this is really the second book.

30:29.030 --> 30:32.553
So this is the second book.

30:33.033 --> 30:34.174
It's funny you should ask that.

30:34.495 --> 30:38.158
I felt no anxiety about writing it.

30:38.518 --> 30:40.760
In that way, I was too absorbed in it.

30:41.220 --> 30:49.888
But now that I've actually got to go out and sell it, and they've printed all these copies, yeah, I have this horrible fear that no one's going to buy it.

30:49.868 --> 30:56.716
Until the thing gets a little momentum.

30:58.138 --> 31:00.080
Have there been any reviews yet?

31:00.100 --> 31:04.365
Reviews have been spectacular.

31:04.425 --> 31:06.868
Times review gave it the lead review on Sunday.

31:06.948 --> 31:10.452
The first review in the section.

31:10.592 --> 31:12.094
Where the hell was that?

31:12.575 --> 31:15.898
They flagged it on the front page of the newspaper.

31:16.099 --> 31:17.260
It was great.

31:17.678 --> 31:19.780
Newsday, Wall Street Journal.

31:20.541 --> 31:26.106
The Wall Street Journal gave a... I mean, the review has been wonderful.

31:26.847 --> 31:38.537
I mean, it made me want to write the reviewer's little notes, because what they've done is, they've more or less, they've done my work for me, and they've said, this isn't like political books.

31:39.618 --> 31:40.740
This isn't, it's different.

31:41.060 --> 31:43.162
And they're willing to take it on its own terms.

31:43.622 --> 31:44.763
That's a really good reviewer.

31:45.344 --> 31:46.605
The reviewer who wants you to

31:47.210 --> 31:48.572
I've written a different book.

31:49.093 --> 31:51.817
It's so frustrating, even when they give you a good review.

31:51.998 --> 32:03.957
Well, no, I was a book review editor for a long time, 13 years, and I used to say, don't, don't, if I give you Robert B. Parker to review, don't expect it to be John Updike.

32:04.137 --> 32:04.417
Right.

32:05.058 --> 32:07.622
You know, you must deal with the book on its terms.

32:07.763 --> 32:08.003
Right.

32:08.776 --> 32:11.881
And a reviewer that understands that, understands it.

32:11.901 --> 32:14.065
And a reviewer that doesn't, I don't use it.

32:14.085 --> 32:16.068
It's very simple.

32:16.088 --> 32:18.913
But you can't drill this into people.

32:18.933 --> 32:20.655
I think that's exactly what you're saying.

32:20.776 --> 32:23.079
It's the kind of thing that you're doing.

32:23.099 --> 32:26.244
I'm sorry, I keep interrupting you.

32:26.285 --> 32:28.448
That's all right.

32:28.708 --> 32:29.750
So what's next now?

32:29.971 --> 32:31.453
You're a generalist, it seems to me.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.957
Don't you think that once

32:34.747 --> 33:03.319
if this thing does well enough that that maybe what will happen is that i mean it's funny it's very funny what happened because of this stuff in this book that now i'm being pigeonholed as a political writer and it used to be that all these people calling me to write oh you got to write about wall street you know blah blah blah and now i could always because all they want me to do is write about politics and i said you know i've said what i've had to say and i'm gonna move on and i'm and and uh i think what happens is it won't happen now but maybe 10 years from now

33:03.586 --> 33:11.334
I'll earn the right to be someone who just writes another book, you know, about something else.

33:11.674 --> 33:16.299
And the key ingredient is to be passionately interested in what you're writing about.

33:16.319 --> 33:19.182
And not to write it because... Good line.

33:19.202 --> 33:22.265
Not to write it because you just want to write another book.

33:22.285 --> 33:26.810
Or because someone thinks there's a market for it, or because that's what you're supposed to be doing.

33:26.950 --> 33:28.552
I have the greatest respect for writers.

33:29.032 --> 33:30.994
Writers I really know and respect.

33:31.767 --> 33:44.158
like Justin Kaplan or David McCullough who invest time and energy and resources in a book and discover they don't want to do it anymore.

33:44.178 --> 33:44.838
Right.

33:44.858 --> 33:45.799
And give it up.

33:45.859 --> 33:50.023
Justin Kaplan, he's done it too often.

33:50.043 --> 33:50.963
He's given up books.

33:51.104 --> 33:52.765
Just gave up a book on William James.

33:52.785 --> 33:55.788
He gave up a book on Grant.

33:55.808 --> 33:56.028
Really?

33:56.048 --> 33:57.469
The Grant book came out.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.271
The Feely's book came out.

33:59.291 --> 34:00.191
It's a surprise.

34:00.211 --> 34:01.032
It takes care of that.

34:01.282 --> 34:03.665
But there's no reason for him giving up on William James.

34:03.865 --> 34:07.309
He wrote the Mark Twain biography, which I loved.

34:07.749 --> 34:16.620
David McCullough gave up a book on Picasso.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.280
Really?

34:17.641 --> 34:17.941
Yeah.

34:17.961 --> 34:18.842
And I said, why?

34:18.902 --> 34:21.325
I said, the more I got to know him, the more I disliked him.

34:21.345 --> 34:22.386
Is that right?

34:22.406 --> 34:22.506
Yeah.

34:22.526 --> 34:26.571
The more I disliked him and the more I disliked what I was doing, and they gave it up.

34:26.591 --> 34:28.453
And then he was working on...

34:28.973 --> 34:33.061
He was working on a Teddy Roosevelt book, on the other hand, with the McFeely book.

34:33.201 --> 34:35.184
So they were both working on Teddy Roosevelt books.

34:36.467 --> 34:42.578
And he was also doing a Grant book, pointing the Cambridge across the river to Justin Campbell.

34:42.980 --> 34:47.846
I would love to read a book about Teddy Roosevelt.

34:47.866 --> 34:49.087
Oh, you can say that.

34:49.107 --> 34:49.608
Say that again.

34:49.628 --> 34:55.614
That we're coming into a Teddy Roosevelt-like age where there's room for a reformer as politicians.

34:56.836 --> 35:02.222
And my candidate for the job of Teddy Roosevelt was John McCain.

35:02.802 --> 35:06.787
He blew up my ship.

35:06.807 --> 35:07.768
I was on the Ariskanese.

35:07.788 --> 35:08.669
Is that right?

35:09.410 --> 35:09.510
Yeah.

35:09.794 --> 35:11.556
Did he fly off your ship when he shot down?

35:11.916 --> 35:12.597
Yeah, I wasn't on it.

35:12.897 --> 35:14.259
I joined it in 68.

35:14.959 --> 35:16.841
I mean, too vietnamese.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.343
He was a miskinete pilot.

35:18.723 --> 35:20.285
You weren't on it when he flew off then?

35:20.565 --> 35:25.190
I was not.

35:25.270 --> 35:26.211
I joined in 68.

35:26.632 --> 35:28.814
When he got shot down I was 66, 67.

35:29.094 --> 35:29.334
Right.

35:29.355 --> 35:30.676
67.

35:30.696 --> 35:34.620
67, so just a year before I came aboard.

35:35.613 --> 35:38.219
He was 790th out of a class of 795.

35:38.399 --> 35:41.747
That was in the Times Magazine.

35:41.787 --> 35:42.007
Right.

35:42.388 --> 35:42.789
Jesus.

35:43.611 --> 35:48.461
You've got to try.

35:48.722 --> 35:51.428
That's amazing, isn't it?

35:53.602 --> 35:58.949
It's funny, you were saying how McCullough gave up a book because he didn't like the subject.

35:58.969 --> 36:01.613
No one ever gives up a magazine article because they don't like the subject.

36:01.653 --> 36:02.354
Just the opposite.

36:02.374 --> 36:04.136
Sometimes they take the magazine article.

36:04.176 --> 36:06.439
But you can't write a book about someone you don't like.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.220
A good book.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.182
I think it's very hard.

36:08.222 --> 36:09.143
It's very hard.

36:09.543 --> 36:17.254
Now, on the other hand, McCullough, when that Teddy Roosevelt book came out, and that's a very good book, by the way, it's McFeely's.

36:17.274 --> 36:21.019
McFeely's book was published by Martin, as a matter of fact, about 15 years ago.

36:21.059 --> 36:21.820
Terrific book.

36:22.576 --> 36:24.618
He was working on it, and he went ahead.

36:25.279 --> 36:27.942
This was Simon Schuster, a very, very commercial house.

36:28.643 --> 36:30.485
And he said, trust me, this is going to be different.

36:30.505 --> 36:32.147
This was mornings on horseback.

36:32.228 --> 36:35.311
It was really about the formative years of Teddy.

36:35.331 --> 36:38.415
It was Teddy as a boy growing up in New York City.

36:39.076 --> 36:41.098
And it was good, and it did make the best somewhere.

36:41.118 --> 36:44.462
So he actually had the courage to continue.

36:44.983 --> 36:51.891
Of course, if he didn't have the path between the seas and the Brooklyn Bridge before him, Simon Schuster never would have allowed him to do it.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.633
Well, you were in the right.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.196
He's my favorite.

36:57.256 --> 37:08.428
I love Macaulay because his history and his scholarship is impeccable, and he captures you and engages you.

37:08.568 --> 37:11.191
I've not read the Truman book, but I've been meaning to.

37:11.871 --> 37:14.694
Read the Panama Canal book.

37:15.175 --> 37:17.477
It's just taking a subject.

37:17.617 --> 37:18.678
He's my hero.

37:18.799 --> 37:20.140
He really is.

37:20.272 --> 37:26.822
totally arcane and challenging subject and really making it
