00:01.921 --> 00:30.561
I'm going to keep this very brief for two reasons first I'm hungry and Chris promised me a good Greek meal

00:31.942 --> 00:39.794
And secondly, I want to have a chance before I head back to Boston to at least say hello and thank you to every single one of you.

00:39.814 --> 00:43.940
And I had a chance to meet a few of you, but not many, and I want to do that before I leave.

00:46.203 --> 00:50.169
Some of you were at breakfast this morning, and I don't want to repeat what I said there.

00:51.952 --> 00:56.799
So let me, if I can, talk a little politics with you this afternoon.

00:56.819 --> 00:57.280
That's okay.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.422
Is that a little politics here?

00:58.502 --> 00:59.423
Is that permitted?

00:59.804 --> 01:00.565
Absolutely.

01:01.608 --> 01:09.999
because I've had a chance to meet and speak to you and with you on many of the great issues that face the country, both here at home and abroad.

01:10.820 --> 01:24.078
And I want to continue that, not just speaking at you, but listening to you and getting a sense from you as to what you expect of me, what you expect of us, what you expect of this country and of the next president of the United States.

01:26.682 --> 01:31.108
But I want to emphasize just as strongly as I can

01:31.544 --> 01:51.493
what Chris has said about the importance of your participation.

01:52.334 --> 02:18.527
Now we're in for what is probably the smallest office you can run for in this country, and that was as a member of the representative town meeting in the town of Brooklyn.

02:19.638 --> 02:25.006
As you know, we have town meetings, as you do, but in the larger towns, we have representative town meetings.

02:25.827 --> 02:31.254
And I ran from a precinct in 1959 as a town meeting member.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.138
And then ran legislation.

02:35.600 --> 02:45.274
And from the day I began running, as a town meeting member in my home precinct, ringing those doorbells, handing out those carrots, standing in front of the polling place,

02:46.148 --> 03:04.807
Until this very day, I have been helped as every single one has held elective operatives by people, citizens, who are interested in only one thing.

03:05.828 --> 03:14.316
A better community, a better state, a better country, a government that they can be proud of.

03:14.482 --> 03:22.812
And that is what it is that gets somebody like me to this point in his political career and to this point in his life.

03:25.314 --> 03:28.618
Chris talked about the money we've raised, the money we've raised over that three months.

03:28.638 --> 03:34.185
$4.2 million in 90 days from 16,000 individuals.

03:35.927 --> 03:38.970
And there's not a dime of PAC money in that entire amount.

03:45.599 --> 03:57.454
And that didn't happen by accident, and with all due respect to Chris and the nice things he said about me, it just didn't happen because Mike Dukakis happens to be what I hope is a good, strong candidate for the presidency.

03:57.494 --> 04:15.117
It happened because dozens and dozens of people here and thousands like you all over the country have been working and helping and asking and reaching out to bring in thousands and thousands of people, yes, as financial contributors, but more than that, as people who care

04:16.531 --> 04:36.436
people who share the kind of commitment that I have and you have to a good America, to a strong America, to a compassionate America, to a thoughtful America, to an America which is strong and tough internationally, but strong and tough for the right reasons and for the right purposes.

04:40.161 --> 04:45.087
And I cannot emphasize to you too much how important

04:47.125 --> 04:50.951
your role, your part, your participation in this effort is.

04:51.872 --> 04:52.733
Chris isn't kidding.

04:55.036 --> 04:59.203
This is, as we say, retail politics at its very best.

05:01.786 --> 05:05.892
Chris was kidding around a little bit this morning about all of the New Hampshire power brokers that were at our breakfast.

05:07.034 --> 05:10.439
And I take my hand off to those of you who are power brokers, self-styled or otherwise.

05:10.479 --> 05:14.044
But you and I know that in this day and age, there really is no such thing.

05:14.952 --> 05:20.904
Nobody gets together in the back of a smoke-filled room and decides who's going to get elected president of the United States.

05:20.924 --> 05:22.106
Those days are gone forever.

05:23.268 --> 05:24.050
And that's okay.

05:26.675 --> 05:29.601
Because this is the political process I believe in.

05:29.641 --> 05:31.384
This is the way I like to campaign.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.889
This is the way I think...

05:34.088 --> 05:35.630
We should be expected to campaign.

05:35.991 --> 05:41.600
Reporters ask me all the time these days, well, you know, it's so long, and isn't there a better way?

05:41.700 --> 05:46.587
And how do you feel having to put in the time and the effort and the days and the weeks and the months?

05:46.607 --> 05:48.430
I think this is a terrific way to campaign.

05:49.592 --> 05:50.914
I like campaigning this way.

05:51.635 --> 05:54.119
I like meeting in your living rooms and in your communities.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.885
I like staying with farm families in Iowa.

05:58.945 --> 06:04.153
and having an opportunity to listen to them about their problems, their concerns, their hopes, their aspirations.

06:05.655 --> 06:09.180
They also, by the way, feed candidates terrifically well.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.264
I'll tell you, folks out there in those farms eat and eat well.

06:12.345 --> 06:15.149
As do Greeks.

06:15.689 --> 06:21.578
Thank you.

06:21.693 --> 06:44.511
i found it good i'm embarrassed i found it

06:44.778 --> 07:07.697
... ... ... ... ... ...

07:08.993 --> 07:27.152
Are we in business over here now?

07:29.055 --> 07:32.318
Probably.

07:33.226 --> 07:55.251
Now we're over here.

07:57.425 --> 08:21.118
I'll tell you all.

08:22.740 --> 08:26.164
Okay.

08:26.405 --> 08:26.605
Thank you.

08:26.585 --> 08:47.164
Thank you.

08:47.484 --> 08:54.330
Thank you.

08:55.036 --> 09:04.991
All right.

09:06.633 --> 09:20.374
Just a few more minutes to go, William, okay?

09:22.597 --> 09:22.697
Okay.

09:23.588 --> 09:39.973
It's about cooler, isn't it?

09:39.993 --> 09:42.456
Yes, it is cooler.

09:42.476 --> 09:44.620
It's about five more minutes.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.103
Five more minutes.

09:47.123 --> 09:48.806
The rice is going to get better.

09:48.826 --> 09:50.929
It's a bit of air.

09:53.153 --> 10:14.087
Oh, yes.

10:14.387 --> 10:18.013
Oh, yes.

10:18.888 --> 10:30.628
I hope to be a great place to be.

10:33.372 --> 10:37.960
Again, do what I do.

10:39.070 --> 10:42.455
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.358
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:44.378 --> 10:45.800
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:45.820 --> 10:47.242
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:47.262 --> 10:48.224
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:48.244 --> 10:49.425
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:49.445 --> 10:50.607
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:50.627 --> 10:52.029
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:52.049 --> 10:53.431
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:53.451 --> 10:55.154
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:55.174 --> 10:56.336
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.619
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:58.639 --> 10:59.621
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

10:59.641 --> 11:00.602
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

11:00.622 --> 11:01.664
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

11:01.684 --> 11:02.665
I never know your son was up to you, didn't you?

11:03.269 --> 11:32.736
It's great to be here for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody, for everybody,

11:34.133 --> 11:37.457
as one of any other being I have ever known or met.

11:37.997 --> 11:53.335
Even my dad probably could not have imagined that someday his son, his son would be the governor of Massachusetts and a serious candidate for presidency.

11:53.355 --> 12:01.284
And my friends, there's only one country on the face of the earth where that could happen, and it's the United States of America.

12:01.544 --> 12:02.605
Thank you all very much.

12:27.104 --> 12:29.588
It's a good band.

12:29.728 --> 12:30.750
I know my Greek bands.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.232
That's pretty good.

12:34.476 --> 12:41.968
See you later, Steve.

12:42.529 --> 12:42.709
Huh?

12:43.690 --> 12:44.051
Oh, really?

12:44.071 --> 12:44.512
I know, too.

12:44.532 --> 12:44.832
All right.

12:44.852 --> 12:45.193
All right.

12:45.213 --> 12:46.675
We had a good time today.

12:47.216 --> 12:47.316
Okay.

12:47.336 --> 12:47.897
Thanks a lot.

12:53.497 --> 12:56.655
Hey, you better go.

12:56.756 --> 12:58.043
We're in here.

12:58.103 --> 13:00.537
I was going to cry, but it was like...
