00:01.651 --> 00:03.113
This is Neil Baldwin.

00:03.133 --> 00:03.313
Go ahead.

00:03.333 --> 00:03.754
I'm sorry.

00:04.595 --> 00:05.897
You're going to tell me something important.

00:05.917 --> 00:06.698
We'll get it out there.

00:06.718 --> 00:08.620
No, it's all Thomas Edison on this side.

00:09.121 --> 00:15.910
Then below that is my, because I started out in poetry.

00:17.552 --> 00:20.616
Then that's all poetry there, poetry there.

00:20.656 --> 00:29.768
Then over here is William Carlos Williams, because my first book was on William Carlos Williams, which I think you said you had a copy of.

00:30.727 --> 00:36.453
And then above that is all the Man Ray stuff, and over there is Man Ray, because the second one was on Man Ray.

00:36.953 --> 00:45.783
And over here, this corner, those two shelves there, and all this stuff lying on the floor, is my next book, my Mexico book.

00:46.804 --> 00:48.726
My book on the Plumed Serpent.

00:48.786 --> 00:51.068
How does that, how does that, I can see a connection.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.971
You don't mind giving me some quotes now, I hope.

00:53.991 --> 00:56.333
But then I thought we could go out and eat something.

00:56.354 --> 00:57.315
You must be starving.

00:57.335 --> 00:58.776
I'm fine, whatever.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.771
See, I see a connection between the three books.

01:02.851 --> 01:03.592
How do you good?

01:05.614 --> 01:09.498
Maybe I'm reaching, but how does Mexico fit in it, does it?

01:09.918 --> 01:18.227
See, my sort of unofficial subtitle is The Biography of a Myth.

01:18.247 --> 01:29.218
In other words, the first three books I wrote, which at the time I started, I obviously didn't know I was going to write a trilogy or anything like that.

01:29.468 --> 01:30.689
What, do you see it as a trilogy?

01:30.829 --> 01:31.130
Now?

01:31.530 --> 01:32.071
Yeah.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.532
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:33.572 --> 01:36.636
In a kind of... Good stuff.

01:36.776 --> 01:37.577
Okay, great.

01:38.137 --> 01:40.640
Not in a pretentious way.

01:40.680 --> 01:46.867
It just dawned on me the other day when I looked at the three of them, that they all dealt with the American imagination.

01:47.848 --> 01:50.891
Basically we have that, yeah.

01:51.452 --> 01:52.272
I quite agree.

01:53.594 --> 01:57.518
The three facts... Sure.

01:57.818 --> 02:11.099
People didn't understand the transition from William Carlos Williams to Man Ray until I pointed out that we were dealing with very highly developed imagination in both cases.

02:11.680 --> 02:24.079
And in the third instance, I felt that I wanted to show how the sources for inspiration in the creative mind

02:25.274 --> 02:35.484
The process is very similar, it doesn't matter whether you're composing a poem, making a photograph, or producing an invention.

02:36.385 --> 02:54.403
I just got finished writing a proposal for a magazine article that we're going to submit tomorrow on the notebooks of Thomas Edison, which I feel are so similar to the raw materials of a poet or the sketchbooks of an artist.

02:54.670 --> 02:59.278
He left behind 3,500 laboratory notebooks.

02:59.698 --> 03:03.705
I mean, you could spend the rest of your life in that.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.892
And no one's ever really taken a look at them as a genre.

03:08.032 --> 03:18.990
I view them as an unknown genre into themselves.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.598
I guess there's only like ten days where he actually kept a diary, in that sense.

03:24.618 --> 03:34.488
But these notebooks, they start in the 1870s when he was a young man, and the last one was written two or three months before his death.

03:36.190 --> 03:49.163
Every invention, as well as some things that never even saw the light of day, spring from these laboratory notebooks.

03:49.649 --> 03:54.196
They're all in the Edison Archives in West Orange, right down the road from here.

03:57.300 --> 03:57.981
Oh, that's great.

03:59.143 --> 04:00.144
Isn't that wonderful?

04:01.406 --> 04:02.748
Is that in the book?

04:02.768 --> 04:02.989
No.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.411
That's not in the book?

04:04.431 --> 04:06.534
Not in the book.

04:06.554 --> 04:08.036
Boy, he's an old guy there.

04:08.096 --> 04:13.905
That was one of the last, his last, you see how he's scribbling in there with that black pencil, that stubby pencil?

04:14.325 --> 04:18.812
So I believe that, I guess what I'm really doing is examining

04:19.535 --> 04:21.437
I mean, it's American.

04:21.537 --> 04:30.646
All three of these were American giants in different ways, and so the nature of American indigenous creativity interested me tremendously.

04:31.066 --> 04:45.340
Not to mention the fact that in all three cases, we have people who were well on in years who were still doing some of their greatest work, and late-life creativity is something else that has been interesting for a long time.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.883
It is interesting, though, the first two guys were decidedly 20th-century

04:49.218 --> 04:50.941
the two cents.

04:51.101 --> 04:56.490
Straddle is the word that you use as a matter of fact.

04:57.792 --> 05:15.782
The artist I think of most potently is Yeats, the poet, who was one of my early favorites, whose dates were 1865 to 1939, sort of relatively similar to Edison.

05:16.235 --> 05:20.120
a creature of the 19th century who grew up in the Romantic era.

05:20.140 --> 05:31.933
I could be talking about both people, and who gradually had to adapt to the conditions of modernism aesthetically, in the case of Yeats, and technologically, in the case of Edison.

05:31.953 --> 05:40.403
And they were sort of on the one hand defining and on the other hand responding to the conditions of their age as older people.

05:45.412 --> 06:12.499
You know, the part at the end of the book where I talk about the research into the rubber plant is, to me, is analogous to the dark tower, the last poems of Yeats, and William Carlos Williams' long eleganic poetry at the end of his life, Man Ray at the end was doing some of his most

06:13.238 --> 06:23.074
I don't think this is what drew you to Edison.

06:23.254 --> 06:28.183
No, I did not say that.

06:28.603 --> 06:29.084
No, no.

06:29.124 --> 06:31.769
That would be too neat.

06:31.969 --> 06:33.612
No, no, no.

06:33.892 --> 06:39.381
You don't know how these things are.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.223
You see them now, I think.

06:41.243 --> 06:41.423
Yeah.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.707
You see them now in reflection and in retrospect and haven't done the work.

06:45.348 --> 06:47.070
But I think we're good.

06:47.190 --> 06:49.433
I'm not, um, presuming here.

06:49.453 --> 06:54.579
I'm not, uh, I'm relatively young.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.762
I'm not young young, but I'm not old, you know.

06:57.203 --> 07:00.186
You're younger than I am.

07:00.547 --> 07:01.829
I mean, I feel young.

07:01.849 --> 07:05.994
But I don't, look, I'm not looking back on my career now and saying this is what I've done.

07:06.274 --> 07:09.418
But I do think, I was talking to someone in the phone when he's out here,

07:09.955 --> 07:24.933
I really think the roots of this book, Thomas Edison's book, go back to my very early days of college, freshman year of college when I took some courses on American intellectual history.

07:24.973 --> 07:26.154
This is in the mid-'60s.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.038
There was a new discipline, the University of Rochester.

07:30.179 --> 07:36.587
American intellectual history, the whole concept that you could define a culture

07:36.922 --> 07:43.151
in another way, that you could define it through the great thinkers, had never occurred to me.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.255
I was eighteen years old at the time.

07:45.275 --> 07:52.365
Freshman course, American Intellectual History, Loren Barrett, B-A-R-I-T-T, L-O-R-E-N, Loren Barrett.

07:52.385 --> 07:53.507
He was my professor.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.510
He's now at Albany.

07:56.331 --> 08:05.545
And he wrote a book called City on a Hill, which is about the roots for American thought, like Perry Miller and some of those

08:05.997 --> 08:09.682
people of the New England theorists, Nature of the Nation, as another book that I used.

08:10.362 --> 08:22.037
And that was when the notion dawned on me that there was more to a culture than wars and battles and the great sort of scientific history.

08:22.097 --> 08:27.624
There was a whole intellectual subtext that was there that you should really learn about.

08:27.984 --> 08:30.047
It was an influential course for the history.

08:35.410 --> 08:38.854
the works of Kenneth Burke.

08:38.874 --> 08:47.203
And I also took a course taught by Norman O. Brown, who was a great psychoanalytic historian of the time.

08:48.505 --> 08:54.011
And I remember at that time thinking that the psyche of a nation could be defined.

08:54.031 --> 08:56.234
These are very, very early thoughts.

08:56.574 --> 08:57.856
You were majoring in what?

08:58.036 --> 08:59.037
I was a history major.

08:59.077 --> 08:59.758
That's the other thing.

08:59.818 --> 09:02.381
I wasn't always a literary, a literati.

09:02.841 --> 09:04.303
I started out as a history major.

09:04.958 --> 09:09.042
And then I went to England for a year and took history over there.

09:09.062 --> 09:12.906
And it wasn't until I got there.

09:13.407 --> 09:20.695
We need, as you know, for these PDW pieces, we need the biographical stuff, if you don't mind my asking.

09:20.875 --> 09:21.716
No, that's fine.

09:21.736 --> 09:33.328
I went to the University of Manchester in the north of England, and I stayed there for a year.

09:34.827 --> 09:47.221
I had several of the history faculty over there, very mainstream courses on European history, continental and English history.

09:47.241 --> 09:48.522
This was when?

09:48.542 --> 09:49.724
67, 68.

09:50.705 --> 09:52.186
So you graduated from Rochester?

09:52.206 --> 09:52.266
69.

09:52.507 --> 09:56.471
So this was like a junior you arrived there?

09:56.491 --> 09:56.671
Uh-huh.

09:57.312 --> 10:00.936
And then, so I graduated from Rochester in 69.

10:01.760 --> 10:17.416
very solid grounding in history, and then I went into grad school at Buffalo in a PhD program in English, because I got a fellowship, teaching fellowship.

10:17.436 --> 10:30.670
But even then, my inclination was to get into the scope of an era, rather than

10:32.067 --> 10:39.474
the particulars of one figure or one bracketed time.

10:40.114 --> 10:44.758
I even then remember thinking I wanted to learn all about modernism.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.241
I wanted to take on the entire modern tradition.

10:49.002 --> 11:00.252
And I ended up going back into the Romantics and studying about Coleridge and Byron and Keats and Blake

11:00.552 --> 11:11.368
And all of that, sort of, I ended up really becoming more interested in the roots for modernism, which I saw really go back to the romantics.

11:11.388 --> 11:12.751
So I got into all of that.

11:12.771 --> 11:20.643
I had an omnivorous hunger to get the sense of an entire period.

11:20.663 --> 11:23.407
And that's how I got into William and Carlisle.

11:23.427 --> 11:29.095
See, it makes, Williams and Man Ray make perfect sense at this point, don't they?

11:29.276 --> 11:29.496
Yes.

11:34.049 --> 11:40.517
which will be the focus of this piece, represents kind of a departure, I would say.

11:40.537 --> 11:44.201
I do see the connection there.

11:44.321 --> 12:03.685
I've worked my way through so many things that, as you're pointing out, it's too facile to act like I was moving toward this consciously, because I never felt that I had a plan.

12:04.913 --> 12:12.863
I know one of my great fascinations is creativity.

12:12.883 --> 12:13.664
Where does it come from?

12:14.525 --> 12:17.569
Can you explain it?

12:17.609 --> 12:20.953
To write about an inventor, to me, what is a great writer?

12:21.073 --> 12:24.257
I mean, Shakespeare, writing was magic.

12:24.437 --> 12:25.899
He pulled this stuff out of the air.

12:27.441 --> 12:28.943
I do see a connection, by the way.

12:29.043 --> 12:29.704
It's very interesting.

12:29.724 --> 12:32.367
People who can't believe that Shakespeare is Shakespeare.

12:32.387 --> 12:34.009
Well, he never went to college.

12:34.445 --> 12:37.870
How could Shakespeare, this guy didn't even have a grade school education, did he?

12:38.230 --> 12:40.894
Tell him I said it's a point.

12:40.914 --> 12:43.076
He dropped out after three months.

12:44.438 --> 12:46.481
So where the hell does it come from?

12:46.681 --> 12:47.963
Who knows?

12:47.983 --> 12:48.964
I'm sorry to jump around.

12:49.004 --> 12:52.189
No, let me just give you the cumulative part.

12:52.429 --> 12:55.293
I mean, so I get to grad school.

12:55.473 --> 13:01.861
I start to hunger for this omnivorous hunger for an entire period of just three years.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.844
You know, I might shoot a couple shots of you.

13:03.925 --> 13:04.746
You know, I don't know.

13:05.047 --> 13:05.928
I don't mind.

13:05.948 --> 13:07.210
I wore my tie and everything.

13:07.230 --> 13:08.132
You look great.

13:08.973 --> 13:11.076
Just keep talking.

13:11.116 --> 13:13.280
This is a great setting, too.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.945
Oh, you've got all my books and everything?

13:18.167 --> 13:20.731
I've got everything, yeah.

13:20.811 --> 13:22.334
This is a perfect feeling for books, too.

13:22.354 --> 13:24.056
So are you a photographer also?

13:24.076 --> 13:25.379
Yeah, you know, it helps.

13:25.759 --> 13:29.064
Everything, every little skill helps.

13:29.104 --> 13:30.827
Every piece I've been for P.W.

13:31.364 --> 13:32.625
We've illustrated with my picture.

13:32.745 --> 13:33.106
I know.

13:33.386 --> 13:34.947
And how did you hook up with that?

13:36.028 --> 13:53.704
Rebecca wants to make it clear that, I mean, I guess the reason I'm putting this in a thing is that there's this huge scholarly underpinning that I think is important to understand.

13:53.764 --> 13:54.945
Don't mind me, all right?

13:55.005 --> 14:00.510
Me as an author, the scholarly aspect and the training that I had, the professional training that I've had,

14:01.182 --> 14:09.892
in grad school, the rigor, you know, of getting a PhD, even though it was in a different discipline.

14:12.315 --> 14:14.317
Do you mind taking your glasses off, or do you always take it?

14:14.357 --> 14:16.880
I always take, I always take with my glasses on.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.361
Okay.

14:18.381 --> 14:18.982
That's fine.

14:19.042 --> 14:19.583
It's just so old.

14:19.943 --> 14:20.964
Yeah, that's fine.

14:20.984 --> 14:22.085
Go ahead.

14:22.106 --> 14:24.869
So, anyway, so I'm getting my PhD.

14:25.309 --> 14:27.792
I'm looking, I couldn't think of what to write an dissertation on.

14:27.812 --> 14:28.793
This happens to me.

14:29.296 --> 14:38.967
I was very involved in collecting and very fired up about the spirit of inquiry, but I had no idea what I was going to write my dissertation about.

14:38.987 --> 14:56.567
And someone told me that all the odd papers of William Carlos Williams were in the archive and poetry collection at the State University at Buffalo, or William Carlos Williams' manuscripts, and they were uncatalogued.

14:57.909 --> 14:59.050
Was that going to go difficult?

15:02.135 --> 15:07.260
So here was an opportunity.

15:07.320 --> 15:19.232
The university was looking for somebody to go through all these papers and systematically make them into a conference.

15:21.334 --> 15:24.417
Did you have any research help?

15:24.938 --> 15:31.905
I was a grad student making $65 a week, and a friend of mine, a fellow grad student,

15:32.257 --> 15:52.257
and I signed up to do this together, and we got the approval of the English department to accept the descriptive catalog of all of William Carlos Lindsay's papers as a dissertation, as fulfilling the dissertation requirements.

15:52.277 --> 15:59.344
And it was published by G. K. Hall & Company, which was in your neck of the woods.

16:00.623 --> 16:04.267
Yes, Alan Peacock.

16:04.367 --> 16:05.248
He's a good guy.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.691
So this was published by G.K.

16:07.711 --> 16:13.879
Hall with a preface by Robert Creeley, the poet who was a mentor with another New Englander, Robert Creeley.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.743
He's someone you should be great to interview sometime.

16:18.043 --> 16:18.924
He's in Buffalo now.

16:18.985 --> 16:21.207
I have interviewed him.

16:21.227 --> 16:25.332
He came to Worcester a year and a half ago.

16:29.311 --> 16:31.394
I consider him to be one of my mentors.

16:31.414 --> 16:34.819
All right, you know what we're going to do?

16:38.344 --> 16:40.648
We're going to shoot available light.

16:40.668 --> 16:41.329
Do you mind that?

16:41.509 --> 16:42.430
Yeah, we can go out.

16:42.491 --> 16:43.833
We're going to go out to lunch anyway.

16:45.435 --> 16:48.019
Go ahead, keep talking.

16:48.339 --> 16:57.613
So we rewrote the preface for that, but that was an extremely rigorous and extremely arduous

16:58.522 --> 17:10.379
in Denver, and taught me how to do, to absorb a huge amount of information in a very brief period of time, which is a skill you have to have, you know, in a biography.

17:10.399 --> 17:16.207
We're going to shoot the pictures after this, because I'm not concentrating on the number one thing that I should be doing.

17:18.490 --> 17:19.932
You know what I'm saying?

17:19.953 --> 17:20.533
Yeah.

17:20.553 --> 17:26.622
So, there I am, with my freshly mentioned PhD, and

17:31.276 --> 17:48.739
And I was unable to get a job because 1973 was documented as the year in which there were more PhDs and less jobs in the history of PhD granting.

17:49.761 --> 17:59.173
So I had to retool my abilities and I entered the non-profit sector and that's when my

18:00.402 --> 18:18.665
Okay, just for the record, it's 1978, and this is a Stephen with a beat, right, L. Myers, M-E-Y-E-R, and the pre-league of the preface.

18:18.685 --> 18:20.928
That's quite a coup, isn't it?

18:20.948 --> 18:24.752
Well, we've studied with him, and he was our... Very wonderful one.

18:24.772 --> 18:27.756
Yeah, he's been a great support to me over the years.

18:28.757 --> 18:30.139
He's a spiritual supporter.

18:30.507 --> 18:42.560
So the point I wanted to make there is that I've really had two careers, contiguous, co-existent careers.

18:42.700 --> 18:55.373
I mean, I've always had full-time institutional jobs in the non-profit sector for two decades, raising money.

18:55.413 --> 18:58.877
I've worked for the Artists in Schools program.

18:59.465 --> 19:07.293
I worked at the Poets and the Schools of Poets and Writers, Teachers and Writers Collaborative.

19:07.313 --> 19:13.219
I worked for Art Park, which is a major art center up in Buffalo as an administrator.

19:14.280 --> 19:26.552
I worked for the New York Public Library in New York City for five years, helping to run the major capital campaign.

19:26.887 --> 19:31.893
I ran the annual giving program there.

19:32.534 --> 19:44.848
And the last about years I've been running the National Book Foundation, as you may know, sponsoring the National Book Awards, and they've built it up into a, it's almost a million dollar a year operation now.

19:45.169 --> 19:48.673
And that thing came out of Rose from the Ashes, didn't it?

19:48.693 --> 19:49.814
Yes, it did.

19:49.834 --> 19:53.839
And this is not necessarily for the... No, it's true, it rose from the ashes.

19:54.477 --> 19:58.082
The foundation was created and I was hired to make it into something.

19:58.303 --> 20:00.807
That was a 90-year standard?

20:00.987 --> 20:06.074
It was about five and a half years.

20:06.435 --> 20:17.151
And all during that time, that's when I've written all of my books, and people say to me, I don't know how you do it and how you do it.

20:18.513 --> 20:22.459
There's a sort of sense of incredulity about it.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.985
And you will understand this.

20:27.466 --> 20:32.193
It's very, very hard to do these two things at the same time.

20:33.494 --> 20:40.124
And just today, I mean, I've already been in touch with my office several times in New York, and there's a whole lot of stuff going on.

20:40.805 --> 20:46.593
And I'm always in a state of being cold one way or the other.

20:46.673 --> 20:52.902
And all my books have been written on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

20:53.557 --> 21:01.685
And, you know, Man Ray involved travel to Europe several times, which I did took on my vacation from the library.

21:03.186 --> 21:09.232
And so I had no idea what it would be like to be a full-time writer.

21:09.292 --> 21:12.535
I have absolutely never been to an artist colony.

21:13.015 --> 21:16.679
I've never gotten a grant for anything, you know, for my writing.

21:16.719 --> 21:19.601
I've gotten lots of grants for the organizations that I've worked for.

21:19.621 --> 21:22.684
I've raised millions and millions of dollars.

21:22.704 --> 21:23.445
That's a good quote.

21:24.286 --> 21:26.189
You don't mind if we use it?

21:26.209 --> 21:27.490
No, you can use anything you want.

21:27.991 --> 21:38.565
But the point I'm trying to make is I have written, I have spent my entire career writing Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, vacations, and reading.

21:38.585 --> 21:41.309
The only thing I can do during the week is read.

21:42.691 --> 21:49.500
Like on the train going to work, on the bus or train coming back, at night, after dinner, after the kids.

21:50.324 --> 21:51.625
By the way, we have two children.

21:53.307 --> 21:57.572
They're going to be very mad at me if I don't mention their names.

21:58.433 --> 22:00.395
Nicholas is my daughter.

22:00.495 --> 22:01.737
Allegra is my daughter.

22:01.957 --> 22:03.358
And how do we spell Allegra?

22:04.340 --> 22:05.821
A-L-L-E-G-R-A.

22:06.182 --> 22:09.726
She's 13 and Nicholas is 15.

22:10.146 --> 22:11.568
And my wife's name is Roberta.

22:13.129 --> 22:13.730
R-O-B-E-R-T-A.

22:14.391 --> 22:14.611
Right.

22:14.771 --> 22:17.314
And she's Roberta Plumstick.

22:17.334 --> 22:19.116
P-L-U-T-T-I-K.

22:19.450 --> 22:23.035
And she works for the Association of American Publishers in the New York City.

22:24.317 --> 22:30.586
She runs the trade general publishing division in New York, AAP.

22:31.368 --> 22:31.708
You know that.

22:31.828 --> 22:32.329
I know.

22:32.349 --> 22:32.609
True.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.551
So she does that.

22:33.831 --> 22:42.264
So, anyway, I have no idea what it would be like to be a full-time writer.

22:42.424 --> 22:45.348
Would you like to be a full-time writer?

22:45.368 --> 22:48.613
I think I'd like to know what it would be like before

22:49.167 --> 22:53.133
I mean, I'd like to at least have the... I'd like to know what it would be like.

22:53.493 --> 22:53.753
Yes.

22:54.575 --> 23:05.029
I just can't imagine being able to wake up in the morning and have the... to be able to just launch into... Luxury is probably the word.

23:05.170 --> 23:12.280
Maybe, because all my writing is done under the most extreme, extreme extenuating circumstances.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.882
And you're able to pick up.

23:14.182 --> 23:17.487
I mean, you're able to put it away on Monday morning...

23:18.395 --> 23:22.419
Oh, you just put on your finger on the hardest thing.

23:22.439 --> 23:45.219
The hardest thing is Monday morning is very hard for me because when I take Fridays off, which I try to do as often as I can, it's not always possible to take Fridays off because of the demands of the institutional role that I have, this tremendous organization.

23:45.239 --> 23:48.402
And I have a very good staff, but, I mean, things are always happening.

23:48.787 --> 23:50.889
So let's say I'm able to take Friday off.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.292
Friday is the buffer zone.

23:53.312 --> 24:00.300
It takes me all of Friday to get my mind into the right position.

24:01.081 --> 24:02.763
So Friday, there's no writing.

24:04.585 --> 24:11.033
Saturday morning, things start to pick up.

24:12.314 --> 24:15.778
Starting around lunchtime on Saturday is very good.

24:16.078 --> 24:17.460
Sunday is usually eight hours.

24:17.744 --> 24:20.807
totally terrific, the best.

24:20.827 --> 24:26.513
But Monday morning is the worst, the transitional moment.

24:26.533 --> 24:29.076
Leaving it, too, because you do get absorbed in this stuff.

24:29.096 --> 24:30.658
Yeah, well, you have to walk away from it.

24:30.938 --> 24:47.616
And then, you know, in the back of your mind, you're thinking about it, and I tell people not to call me during the week on book-related matters and not to bring it up, but obviously, especially now, you know this period, this is like, there's basically a month-to-cub date

24:48.625 --> 24:53.750
And it's like there's just a lull before the storm because there's all this stuff building up.

24:53.770 --> 24:54.751
Are you excited, though?

24:55.272 --> 24:55.893
Yes, I am.

24:56.013 --> 24:57.214
Are you anxious as well?

24:57.274 --> 24:59.336
I am nervous.

24:59.356 --> 24:59.957
I am nervous.

25:02.359 --> 25:04.141
Don't be, because the book's wonderful.

25:04.822 --> 25:05.603
I'm just nervous.

25:05.623 --> 25:07.685
I'm not reading it as a critic as well, you know.

25:07.705 --> 25:12.590
I mean, I read these books critically.

25:12.610 --> 25:13.171
It's a good book.

25:13.451 --> 25:15.173
No, I think it's a good book.

25:15.507 --> 25:19.212
I'm nervous like the way I was before my kids were born.

25:19.252 --> 25:20.914
It feels exactly the same.

25:23.477 --> 25:40.840
When my wife was very, very pregnant, and we knew that the kids were going to come, that it was going to happen soon, you're excited because you want it to happen, but you're nervous because you want it to be good.

25:41.005 --> 25:48.952
I know it's almost a cliché that just dates in it and all that, because it was four years in the making, three and a half years in the making.

25:50.013 --> 25:51.154
That's pretty darn good.

25:52.335 --> 25:56.278
I would have thought it took a lot more time than that.

25:56.298 --> 25:58.220
Well, no.

25:58.941 --> 26:02.824
But you see, a lot of it's happening on another level in my mind all the time.

26:04.586 --> 26:09.510
I'm not complaining, and as a matter of fact, I don't consider myself to be

26:10.199 --> 26:32.941
a complaining writer, of which there are many, because I only write things that I really, really want to write, and I only embark upon a project that I really, really want to do, and I really want to do it, and it's a treat, and it's basically very, very satisfying in the end.

26:33.722 --> 26:38.687
But there's no question that the

26:38.836 --> 27:05.518
It's the back and forth, the wear and tear on your psyche when one day you're dealing with institutional development, board relations, budgets, talking to donors, program development, staff, personnel, payroll, correspondence, phone call every five minutes.

27:05.971 --> 27:08.935
you know, which is basically what it's like at the National Book Awards now.

27:10.057 --> 27:24.938
And then, you know, you step back from that and you come back and do this, you're in your study, you're by yourself, you're trying to, you have to induce, you have to artificially almost make yourself become reflective.

27:25.859 --> 27:31.527
Is this a therapeutic exercise for you, the writing, or is it just a different life?

27:31.627 --> 27:34.611
I mean, do we really just change hats from

27:35.688 --> 27:48.087
Well, is there something you do for pleasure, or is there a pain in the back?

27:48.107 --> 27:48.989
I don't know.

27:49.129 --> 28:04.092
I want—as I think I said this before, I have this very omnivorous feeling about information and learning as much about something as I can.

28:05.337 --> 28:14.127
It's a very good feeling when I'm in the groove and I'm absorbing all this information.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.012
I wouldn't call it therapeutic.

28:19.093 --> 28:23.718
It's more like the satisfying of a hunger that's not satisfied by the other things I do.

28:23.999 --> 28:26.802
The other things I do are very satisfying in other ways, too.

28:27.162 --> 28:33.049
No, I'm getting the sense here that you enjoy this other.

28:33.586 --> 28:46.086
You said you had no idea what it would be like to be a full-time writer, and I said, that Ted Wiesner, who I just did a couple weeks ago, I mean this guy just, he fantasizes about what it would be like to be able to do nothing.

28:46.627 --> 28:59.627
I mean when we played it down, he said, well don't, don't, I'm very grateful that he was in golf, and he said, I don't want to, you know, but he would love nothing more than to, and when he had to get up and drive into Boston on those days,

29:00.535 --> 29:05.441
But see, I'm very conflicted about it.

29:06.423 --> 29:08.986
Frankly, everyone knows I'm conflicted about it.

29:09.006 --> 29:29.833
Everybody I know in my institutional life is aware of that I'm conflicted, because I'm very social, I have the capacity, I'm very sociable, I love to go out to lunch with people, I love going to the National Arts Club and having lunch with people, and I love going to

29:30.353 --> 29:55.973
champagne receptions and i love our board meetings because they're exciting and we have them in different people's ceos offices and i like hanging out with ceos and i like raising money and i'm very good at it but i also just to meet you know to be up here by myself for a whole day with the radio on and just clicking away on my computer right with the radio

29:56.155 --> 30:00.441
The very low, WNYC, public radio.

30:00.662 --> 30:01.643
Public radio!

30:03.426 --> 30:05.749
Which I hope with Mr. Gingrich we were able to keep.

30:05.829 --> 30:11.297
No, I'm a, you know, that's what I listen to, and keep it very low.

30:11.478 --> 30:14.562
I don't listen to talk, only music.

30:14.622 --> 30:22.534
But the point is that I have equally hunger for that.

30:24.100 --> 30:29.867
He loves being a lawyer.

30:30.427 --> 30:31.268
I know he does.

30:31.949 --> 30:32.530
I know he does.

30:32.630 --> 30:36.154
I've talked to him about it recently, actually.

30:37.676 --> 30:51.171
But I do think it would be interesting to know what it would be like to only be responsible for my work, my writing.

30:52.433 --> 30:57.261
I would be misleading if I said that that wasn't something I would like to do.

30:57.562 --> 31:05.075
With this thesis, we get the actual title of it, The Manuscripts and Letters of Wayne Foster.

31:05.877 --> 31:09.283
And let me just tell the contractor, okay, something good.

31:09.303 --> 31:10.385
Now I'll write this down.

31:12.769 --> 31:14.993
These things are great, I think.

31:15.033 --> 31:16.375
That's one of those miniature ones?

31:16.455 --> 31:16.956
Yeah.

31:17.932 --> 31:20.976
I'm a New York native.

31:21.897 --> 31:27.364
On my mother's side, I'm a third generation Manhattanite.

31:28.446 --> 31:34.374
My grandmother, my mother, and myself, we were all born in Manhattan, and my kids were born in New York.

31:35.776 --> 31:37.978
So they're the fourth.

31:38.659 --> 31:39.280
That's true.

31:39.941 --> 31:45.188
But then after living in Brooklyn Heights, we lived there from 77 to 86.

31:45.353 --> 31:58.288
and the kids were born, you know, in the late 70s, early 80s, and they got to be big and moved out here, which was very hard for me because I was an urban animal, you know.

31:58.889 --> 32:00.711
But I've adjusted.

32:00.731 --> 32:01.552
It's a nice system.

32:01.652 --> 32:02.613
I love little towns.

32:03.194 --> 32:04.336
It's very beautiful.

32:04.676 --> 32:05.557
Very beautiful.

32:05.577 --> 32:07.740
This is probably, what, half an hour from the city here?

32:07.760 --> 32:08.440
You take the train?

32:09.181 --> 32:11.164
Well, I can get to my office.

32:12.946 --> 32:14.027
I leave usually

32:14.463 --> 32:17.648
I take the 8.06 train and I'm in my office by about 9.

32:18.649 --> 32:19.150
That's great.

32:19.731 --> 32:30.086
And on the weekends my daughter takes dance in New York and on Saturdays we drive her in and it takes about 20 minutes, just like that, in the car.

32:30.446 --> 32:41.162
I figured four hours to get down here this morning and I did it in three and a half with a 15 minute stop for guests, you know, and it was terrific.

32:42.442 --> 32:56.057
No, so there I am with my divided life, I meant to make that point, and my twenty years working in the non-profit sector and raising money and doing institutional development writing biographies.

32:56.237 --> 33:10.052
And along the way, having to become habituated to this rhythm of constrained way of writing.

33:10.657 --> 33:12.940
compressed and constrained with writing.

33:12.980 --> 33:31.985
I just wanted to make sure that I explained that to people because it's been very productive for me and I wonder what would happen if I didn't have those pressures.

33:32.045 --> 33:35.770
I wonder how it would affect my work.

33:36.037 --> 33:37.319
But that's neither him nor there.

33:37.399 --> 33:38.541
That's the way it happened.

33:38.581 --> 33:39.462
That's my life.

33:39.562 --> 33:43.588
No, the dissertation was 1978, so... It was published in 78.

33:43.748 --> 33:44.830
Published in 78.

33:44.850 --> 33:46.392
And you finished graduate school when?

33:46.412 --> 33:46.532
73.

33:46.572 --> 33:47.694
73.

33:47.774 --> 33:51.680
And then you, just to get the... Yeah, that space there.

33:52.301 --> 33:52.641
Yeah.

33:52.801 --> 34:00.893
I spent, I basically got my PhD, and I immediately found that there were no jobs for teaching English.

34:00.913 --> 34:03.557
That was when I was trained to be an English professor.

34:04.158 --> 34:05.740
I had never been an English professor.

34:05.990 --> 34:11.659
I've been a part-time English teacher, and I've taught in every institution of higher learning in New York City.

34:13.082 --> 34:17.849
NYU, City College, Baruch College, the New School, and Fordham.

34:17.869 --> 34:18.370
Columbia.

34:18.551 --> 34:18.971
Everything.

34:19.031 --> 34:20.975
Not Columbia, that's the only one I haven't taught at.

34:21.876 --> 34:32.233
And I've taught courses in the summertime, I've taught courses at night, I've taught courses in my lunch hour, I've taught, you know, this, that, and the other.

34:32.669 --> 34:35.572
I've never been a full-time English professor.

34:35.813 --> 34:47.767
As I say, I had to retool and I had to go into another and totally different area of livelihood, which was a pretty big shock.

34:47.787 --> 34:52.072
It's like going to medical school and then being told you can't be a doctor, you know.

34:52.092 --> 35:02.625
I thought I was going to be a professor, but actually I think it's been fortuitous for me because I've basically been into, the first phase was, as I say, arts.

35:03.314 --> 35:07.159
arts in education, you know, the whole artist in school movement.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.202
I was one of the pioneers of that.

35:10.824 --> 35:16.752
I wrote a book about teaching poetry to children called The Poetry Writing Handbook.

35:17.714 --> 35:20.678
That was published by Scholastic.

35:20.698 --> 35:23.722
That was a nice work.

35:23.782 --> 35:33.135
Now, what was it that, I mean, is there a defining event that encourages you to believe, you know, I can really

35:33.942 --> 35:37.425
I can bring the heat as the pitchers say.

35:37.485 --> 35:40.348
I can really bring that fastball in there.

35:40.408 --> 35:45.973
What was it that prompted you to believe that you could really write at this major league level?

35:48.856 --> 35:51.458
How funny that you put it that way.

35:51.478 --> 35:52.279
Pardon me.

35:52.559 --> 36:00.827
You have to feel, I mean here you are, you're having a sense of pre-publication jitters.

36:01.043 --> 36:02.865
what people are going to think about it, I guess.

36:02.885 --> 36:05.928
I think if I didn't have that, I'd be worried.

36:06.348 --> 36:06.929
Yeah, I agree.

36:07.129 --> 36:28.911
I'm not, I am, I'll be frank with you, I think this is the best book I've ever done, in many ways, because it's a good read, and yet it's got 150 pages of scholarship at the back for anybody who's, but I wanted to tell a story, a really good story, and I didn't want my erudition to get in the way of that.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.493
I am obsessed with the

36:32.026 --> 36:35.029
the importance of a good narrative.

36:35.769 --> 36:44.357
I worked so hard on the transitions, every sort of segue to me is key.

36:46.739 --> 36:51.003
So you ask me, well, when did I think I could be a major league writer?

36:51.243 --> 36:53.005
I never even thought in those terms.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.588
I just, I really would like an audience.

36:56.608 --> 36:59.570
I want an audience, a big audience, frankly.

36:59.891 --> 37:00.191
I do.

37:00.371 --> 37:01.392
I want a big audience.

37:01.675 --> 37:05.360
I don't want to be, I didn't want to write a doorstop.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.282
There's no reason to apologize.

37:06.362 --> 37:08.805
No, I didn't want to write a thousand-page doorstop.

37:09.606 --> 37:18.239
I remember Jenny Cox, the editor who acquired this book, who's no longer at Hyperion, but she deserves the credit because she thought of the idea.

37:18.419 --> 37:21.283
Jenny was a J. Cox, C-O-X.

37:21.303 --> 37:22.004
And she was an editor?

37:22.285 --> 37:22.946
At Hyperion.

37:22.966 --> 37:27.672
Now she's left to raise her young children.

37:28.233 --> 37:31.598
She lives up in Westchester.

37:32.388 --> 37:37.616
And she said to me, Neil, this isn't going to be a doorstop, I hope.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.277
And I said, no.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.663
A thousand-page biography, for instance.

37:44.065 --> 37:52.497
As a genre, I'm not casting aspersions on thousand-page biographies per se.

37:53.058 --> 37:58.165
But to me, I don't see the point of it.

37:58.185 --> 38:01.450
I think if you want to tell a story of a person's life,

38:01.801 --> 38:06.605
You want to keep your reader, and you want to hold their attention, and you want to make it like a novel.

38:07.306 --> 38:23.059
I'm proud that my friend Gloria Naylor, the author, she's a friend of mine, and she's a novelist, I think, of the highest ability, and she felt that this read like a novel, and she felt that Thomas Edison was like a main character in a novel.

38:23.980 --> 38:31.386
And I was very flattered by that, because I really, really wanted that to be the feeling of it.

38:33.560 --> 38:55.129
No, I'm just, because you've had these two lives, you know, and I was a newspaper, I was a journalist for so many years, I've been an editor, but you know, up here is always this goal to write this book, and I guess you working institutionally and teaching

38:56.054 --> 39:00.438
I'm wondering if hovering here is, I really want to be the writer, you know, and you've done it.

39:01.919 --> 39:05.803
This is your third book now, and pretty brief.

39:08.145 --> 39:08.806
You're a young guy.

39:09.246 --> 39:10.867
Three biographies in a decade.

39:10.967 --> 39:12.269
That's terrific.

39:15.992 --> 39:17.513
What prompted you to do the first one?

39:17.653 --> 39:19.896
I guess, of course, the Williams must have grown out of it.

39:19.916 --> 39:24.880
The interesting thing about that was the William Carlos Williams book,

39:26.193 --> 39:30.599
had fifteen years of momentum, and I wrote it in six months.

39:31.320 --> 39:36.166
In other words, I started doing my work on Williams in the early seventies.

39:36.687 --> 39:46.279
The book was published by Athenaeum in 84, and I wrote it in six months, but I had fifteen years of ferment.

39:47.821 --> 39:49.223
Tell me, because P.W.

39:49.283 --> 39:50.945
likes the publishing history.

39:50.965 --> 39:52.027
Yeah, I know.

39:52.067 --> 39:54.630
That's good that they do that.

39:55.201 --> 39:56.663
Tell me how that came about.

39:56.683 --> 39:59.886
Did you have an agent for the first book?

39:59.906 --> 40:02.429
I've had three different agents for all three.

40:02.449 --> 40:04.692
I've had different agents for every book.

40:06.815 --> 40:10.299
Did you care to identify them?

40:10.319 --> 40:10.859
Yeah, no.

40:10.879 --> 40:14.684
I mean, I had very good relationships with all three of my agents.

40:15.785 --> 40:22.693
My first agent was Richard Hutner, H-U-T-T-N-E-R.

40:23.467 --> 40:26.271
Richard Hutner was an old school chum of mine.

40:26.471 --> 40:31.318
I went to Horace Mann and the Riverdale Prep School, and he was a school friend of mine.

40:31.819 --> 40:35.824
He agented that, and that was 1984.

40:37.987 --> 40:44.096
Marcia Marshall, M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L.

40:44.176 --> 40:51.887
And the second book was agented by Tim Schaffner, S-C-H-A-F-F-N-E-R.

40:52.137 --> 40:59.186
His father was John Schaffner, who was a very, I'm sure a lot of these people who read PW will know, John Schaffner Associates.

40:59.887 --> 41:20.794
John Schaffner was Tim's father, and he passed away, and Tim sort of backed into becoming an agent, and he was very young, and he did Man Ray, and placed it with Clarkson Potter, and my editor was Nancy Novogrod, who's the greatest NOV

41:21.078 --> 41:31.688
O-G-R-O-D, a very gifted editor who went on to become editor-in-chief of House and Garden, and now she's editor of Travel and Leisure.

41:32.269 --> 41:35.352
So there really was an opportunity to offer this to her?

41:36.313 --> 41:36.553
No.

41:36.793 --> 41:41.718
She began at the New Yorker.

41:42.338 --> 41:44.000
She was at the New Yorker for ten years.

41:44.040 --> 41:49.465
She worked directly for William Shawn, S-H-A-W.

41:49.867 --> 41:56.275
Nancy was wonderful, and we're still friends, and now we keep in touch with each other.

41:56.295 --> 42:01.502
They've kind of moved around in terms of editors and— But I've been very lucky.

42:01.602 --> 42:16.161
I've been—and then the third iteration, Jenny Cox, the interesting thing about that is that she—well, she is married to another school.

42:16.512 --> 42:20.938
a chum of mine, from Horace Mann, Howard Bloom, the author, B-O-U-M.

42:21.679 --> 42:31.152
He wrote Out There, he wrote The Search for Nazis in America, that book about, he wrote the John Gotti book, he writes for Vanity Fair.

42:31.493 --> 42:33.035
Oh, I interviewed him.

42:33.055 --> 42:34.296
There was an SMS book, I think.

42:34.316 --> 42:36.920
Yeah, he's a really good writer.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.622
Howard, he's my age, actually.

42:38.642 --> 42:39.864
He looks younger than him.

42:39.884 --> 42:41.146
He worked at the New York Times for a while.

42:41.166 --> 42:42.908
Yes, he was a reporter at The Voice.

42:43.950 --> 42:45.692
Howard Bloom, married to Jenny.

42:46.077 --> 42:53.447
And Howard was a fan, and he, Jenny, he said, you know, you've got to publish a book of Neil.

42:53.467 --> 43:01.958
He's a wonderful writer, and she also knows my current agent, David Chalfant, C-H-A-L-F, as in Frank, A-N-T.

43:02.799 --> 43:12.152
And David hooked me up with Jenny, and she took me out to lunch, and she had just joined Hyperion, which didn't even have a name or a letterhead.

43:13.094 --> 43:15.297
I'm very impressed with what they've done.

43:15.317 --> 43:17.380
This is four, it's not even four years.

43:17.460 --> 43:19.583
Well it's first class from day one.

43:19.783 --> 43:34.444
I mean you talk about hitting the ground, running, and like I was, again when they say I'm a friend of that, I've followed them from the first and written and been happy to write about their books in their office.

43:34.464 --> 43:40.452
But I've been very impressed by what they've done.

43:40.735 --> 43:45.780
Any reason why you moved around from agent to agent or anything that you cared about?

43:45.800 --> 43:46.060
Yes.

43:46.300 --> 43:47.842
Well, I learned my lesson.

43:48.222 --> 43:49.043
You don't want to talk about it.

43:49.303 --> 43:49.483
No.

43:49.803 --> 43:50.904
The lesson is like this.

43:51.745 --> 43:56.590
I do not, as I said to you before, I want to write what I want to write.

43:57.270 --> 44:03.816
And agents, if an agent isn't excited about the project, you have two choices.

44:03.856 --> 44:07.840
You can either do another project or get another agent.

44:09.575 --> 44:17.783
My agent, whoever represents me, has to have the same degree of frenetic excitement about the project.

44:17.823 --> 44:20.225
You have to be a champion of the book.

44:20.946 --> 44:22.667
Otherwise it's the cart leading the horse.

44:24.770 --> 44:31.756
I want to write what I want to write, and I mean the agent wants to represent what I want to write.

44:31.856 --> 44:35.540
I'm not going to write what someone else, what they might want me to write.

44:36.180 --> 44:38.923
So do I sense that maybe there was some of this?

44:39.663 --> 44:46.352
Yeah, well, Richard, I think, wow, what happened with Richard?

44:47.594 --> 44:51.199
He, I guess, you know, he didn't, he... We won't go into that.

44:51.219 --> 44:55.525
I'm not going into that, but that's basically, I believe... I know how these things look in print, too.

44:55.545 --> 44:56.726
It's project-driven.

44:56.746 --> 44:56.967
Yeah.

44:57.167 --> 44:58.349
And Richard was great.

44:58.369 --> 44:59.190
That's a good phrase.

44:59.751 --> 45:00.812
It is project-driven.

45:00.832 --> 45:01.213
Yeah.

45:01.233 --> 45:02.234
Richard was wonderful.

45:02.254 --> 45:02.795
He used that.

45:02.815 --> 45:08.843
Tim was good, and then Tim got out of the agent business entirely after a few years, so he moved out west.

45:09.245 --> 45:18.293
And David, I've been with him for about five years now, and he's young and very hungry, and he's done a very good job.

45:18.673 --> 45:21.255
And is he handling the next book?

45:21.275 --> 45:22.877
Is the next book under contract to Hyperion?

45:22.897 --> 45:24.798
The next book has been signed up by Hyperion.

45:24.818 --> 45:30.764
It's called Tracking the Plumed Serpent, Adventures in Time and Space in Mexico.

45:31.584 --> 45:33.386
Time and Space in Mexico.

45:33.406 --> 45:34.907
Time and Space in Mexico.

45:34.927 --> 45:35.207
In Mexico.

45:35.227 --> 45:38.290
Now, does this require field work?

45:38.523 --> 45:39.444
Yes.

45:39.504 --> 45:42.306
Well, I've already been to Mexico a few times.

45:42.947 --> 45:44.208
I've been working on this book.

45:46.530 --> 45:59.802
It makes me sound like a maniac, but this is the fact of the matter, that this book had its gestation in 1988 when my wife and I went on a vacation on a whim.

45:59.822 --> 46:08.310
We went to the Yucatan, just on a whim, and I became intoxicated with the

46:08.746 --> 46:11.250
Mayan ruins in the Yucatan.

46:13.032 --> 46:18.741
And I said to her, you know, one day I want to come back and I want to do a book on this whole area of the world.

46:18.881 --> 46:20.143
I just, I have to.

46:20.183 --> 46:35.445
And, um, so this, then the next year we went back again on another vacation, and I first sort of took notes on the basic theme of the book.

46:35.678 --> 46:57.198
While all this other stuff was going on, A Man Ray was being finished and then Thomas Edison was being developed, this Mexico book was sort of slowly building up and I was acquiring books on that region and reading and doing a little research on it.

46:57.238 --> 46:58.939
Did you have a focus on the book, though, at that point?

47:00.120 --> 47:01.381
It's changed.

47:01.401 --> 47:05.365
At first it was going to be, as I called it, a fatal shore

47:06.290 --> 47:07.692
of the Yucatan.

47:09.474 --> 47:13.440
But that was too bombastic, too big.

47:14.421 --> 47:31.825
And then as I came to terms with the fact that I was a biographer, number one, I decided to focus on the major archetypal mythic figure of Mesoamerican culture.

47:32.564 --> 47:41.257
The Plumed Serpent, Quetzalcoatl is the Q-U-E-T-Z-A-L-C-O-A-T-L.

47:43.160 --> 48:00.968
And instead of writing a biography of a person's life, since another one of my interests has always been back in the poetry days, archetypes and cultural myths and beliefs and how they come to be,

48:01.842 --> 48:07.408
I decided to find out as much as I could about this figure.

48:07.649 --> 48:30.955
No one has ever taken the disparate stories from Aztec and Mayan cultures, the geographical iconography of the temples, the different versions of the story that have been passed down through the Spanish ethno-historians.

48:32.183 --> 48:49.767
No one has ever taken all of that and plugged them into the geographical progress of the myth from northeastern Mexico to the Yucatan, through time from 1500 BC to the present, and put them all together into a coherent story.

48:50.308 --> 48:53.452
How deeply are you into this, would you say?

48:53.472 --> 48:56.776
Well, I've read about 250 books.

48:56.897 --> 48:58.298
Has the writing started?

48:58.318 --> 48:58.519
No.

48:58.659 --> 49:00.942
I'm going to Mexico in April for two weeks.

49:01.377 --> 49:05.102
and it's due and the book is supposed to be handed in September of 96.

49:05.322 --> 49:13.812
I don't think it's going to be a problem because, as I say, it's sort of having this pre-writing process in my head.

49:14.914 --> 49:25.066
And, um, I have sort of had a running start in my research going back to the first time I went to Mexico.

49:28.010 --> 49:31.114
So, after that, I

49:31.634 --> 49:38.301
I can see myself going back to another sort of major biography, but I don't know what it's going to be about.

49:38.321 --> 49:42.646
Let's talk about Edison now, if we can.

49:42.666 --> 49:43.467
It's a good idea.

49:43.567 --> 49:46.069
Geographically.

49:46.229 --> 49:49.513
It's very important, and it'll all be useful.

49:49.613 --> 49:57.041
But now it's, what are we, 15 or 20 miles from, I mean, geographically?

49:57.822 --> 50:00.004
Five miles away.

50:00.642 --> 50:06.388
So let's talk a little bit about it.

50:06.668 --> 50:20.062
Was it the coincidence of proximity, or what was it that first sparked the interest in Edison, or was it this fascination for, you know, invention, genius?

50:21.003 --> 50:21.723
Two things.

50:22.104 --> 50:23.645
One, three things.

50:24.126 --> 50:30.092
The American story is a story that I've been concerned with for a long time,

50:30.376 --> 50:34.661
explain to you, the American cultural story, how it came to be.

50:35.061 --> 50:37.904
Going back to de Tocqueville, what does it mean?

50:37.944 --> 50:43.310
What is the American story, and who represents it, and who says it, who tells it?

50:43.330 --> 50:52.400
Number two, the nature of imagination and creativity is something that has preoccupied me for a long time.

50:53.160 --> 50:59.387
Number three, after Man Ray was finished, I went through this crisis of

51:00.262 --> 51:07.329
You know, this idealistic crisis that, well, any good biographer has to think of the subject himself.

51:08.270 --> 51:09.671
It's got to come from within.

51:09.691 --> 51:10.932
You know, you've got to think.

51:10.952 --> 51:12.233
So I couldn't think of anybody.

51:12.453 --> 51:22.603
So I started, you know, beating myself over the head, like, well, you know, if you can't think of anything, then I don't know what, you know, what worth are you.

51:22.643 --> 51:30.150
So I went out to lunch with James Atlas, the biographer of Delmar Schwartz, who's an editor of the New York Times.

51:30.502 --> 51:31.703
I told him this problem.

51:31.723 --> 51:34.786
He said, Neil, I didn't think of a Delmore Schwartz biography idea.

51:34.826 --> 51:35.767
That wasn't my idea.

51:35.807 --> 51:39.971
He said, Roger Strauss proposed that to me.

51:40.591 --> 51:42.913
And you don't have to think of it yourself.

51:42.993 --> 51:45.135
Don't get hung up on that, you know.

51:45.175 --> 51:55.665
And that was important by way of introducing the fact that this idea was proposed to me by Jenny Cox.

51:56.966 --> 51:57.927
We had lunch.

51:59.915 --> 52:05.240
She said, I want you to write a book for me, and I'm going to call you up every day and pitch you ideas.

52:05.260 --> 52:07.122
What a wonderful circumstance.

52:07.142 --> 52:11.006
Until we come up with a book for you to write for Hyperion.

52:12.888 --> 52:18.053
So her assistant starts calling me every few days.

52:18.233 --> 52:22.197
She must have had this terrific respect for your earlier work.

52:22.217 --> 52:22.638
Yeah.

52:24.700 --> 52:25.341
This is the guy.

52:26.141 --> 52:26.842
Thank God.

52:27.102 --> 52:29.685
I've been waiting for this.

52:31.032 --> 52:44.530
Jenny Cox, right again, Jenny Cox, uh, flowered the book, but she left, and Rick, do you know who Rick caught, uh, R-I-C-K, caught K-O-T?

52:45.191 --> 52:48.195
He is a, an incredible non-fiction editor.

52:48.215 --> 52:49.637
He, he was at HarperCollins.

52:50.899 --> 52:51.320
Ooh.

52:51.340 --> 52:52.321
There was a nice day.

52:54.123 --> 52:56.847
Coffee.

52:57.788 --> 52:58.329
Coffee?

52:58.349 --> 52:59.190
Is that you?

52:59.210 --> 52:59.270
No.

52:59.290 --> 53:00.432
Oh, you ought to, I'm sorry.

53:01.120 --> 53:07.389
Don't sleep at all.

53:07.830 --> 53:09.232
And the water.

53:09.733 --> 53:12.036
I drink a lot of water.

53:12.097 --> 53:16.023
All right.

53:16.704 --> 53:26.959
Rick was at HarperCollins for a long time, and he joined Hyperion in the fall of 90s.

53:28.019 --> 53:37.611
At which time my book was about two-thirds finished manuscript.

53:37.712 --> 53:42.278
Well, there were anxious moments when you switched editors like that.

53:42.738 --> 53:45.061
Well, there was a moment where I didn't have really anybody.

53:48.706 --> 53:57.317
But I knew that Rick was moving to Hyperion and he is probably one of the best non-fiction editors in the entire industry.

53:57.635 --> 53:58.936
He has a great reputation.

53:58.956 --> 53:59.937
He's highly respected.

54:01.258 --> 54:08.684
He did a gorgeous job on this manuscript.

54:08.704 --> 54:15.430
I'll tell you, I love the juxtaposition of the photos, the integration of the photos.

54:15.450 --> 54:16.691
I wanted to do it that way.

54:17.612 --> 54:19.213
Did you know it's cheaper to do it that way?

54:19.273 --> 54:20.114
No, I don't.

54:20.134 --> 54:22.696
We haven't even submitted the pictures in my book yet.

54:22.796 --> 54:25.919
I would love to have done it that way.

54:25.939 --> 54:27.540
It's just going to be a 16-page album.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.081
You know, so what.

54:29.101 --> 54:33.665
Well, I wanted, that goes back to my narrative idea.

54:33.725 --> 54:43.874
I wanted the pictures to tie in exactly to the text, and you'll probably see they really do hit exactly when I'm talking about whatever I'm talking about.

54:44.054 --> 54:46.877
But you have such wonderful pictures, too.

54:46.897 --> 54:49.319
Well, they're, that's, they really have a rocket.

54:49.359 --> 54:55.705
The photo research is done by me, and, um,

54:55.870 --> 54:59.220
Of course, I had a lot of experience with Man Ray doing all those photos.

55:02.770 --> 55:07.163
So what else can I tell you?
