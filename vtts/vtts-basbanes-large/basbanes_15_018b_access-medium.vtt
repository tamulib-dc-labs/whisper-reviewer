WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:03.673
We're on.

00:05.594 --> 00:06.435
Well, I guess we start.

00:06.455 --> 00:10.359
This book's a departure for you, in form.

00:11.620 --> 00:12.260
Why do you say that?

00:15.303 --> 00:16.084
Why do I say that?

00:16.284 --> 00:20.568
In terms of content, in terms of the... In content, yes.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.110
Form, not really.

00:23.130 --> 00:23.890
Not form.

00:23.910 --> 00:27.033
I retract.

00:27.053 --> 00:31.337
I meant in terms of what the expression and what the...

00:32.009 --> 00:37.096
what you're trying to do fictionally.

00:37.116 --> 01:01.392
Well, I think that it's a departure in the sense that it's so much more geographically centered in the United States, but I'm not entirely sure that it's a great departure in terms of theme or

01:02.570 --> 01:08.339
in terms of my point of view.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.161
Do you think so?

01:15.349 --> 01:18.654
Maybe I'm probing just a little too deep.

01:18.674 --> 01:22.199
Why don't you go ahead and get right to what you mean to me.

01:22.379 --> 01:26.265
No, I'm just actually looking for a discussion on

01:27.292 --> 01:40.386
on your view as a writer of fiction, whereas the first two books did seem to be very clearly autobiographical, certainly had autobiographical resonances, this could or could not.

01:40.426 --> 01:42.989
I mean, this seems to be more of a story.

01:43.049 --> 01:49.656
I mean, it could be your Harvard experience, but it doesn't necessarily have to be.

01:49.796 --> 01:56.623
Well, I think it's easy to overstate the autobiographical

01:57.751 --> 02:01.235
content of the first two books.

02:02.437 --> 02:16.353
Obviously, the outline of my life as a child and a young boy corresponds with the story of wartime life.

02:16.493 --> 02:26.425
But I really used that material in my experiences during the war, a little bit before the war in Poland.

02:27.097 --> 02:32.062
directly after it to make what I consider a novel, not a memoir.

02:33.204 --> 02:44.876
So there is stuff from my life, but it's been reworked and changed and idealized for short and twisted around.

02:44.896 --> 02:47.159
So it's not an autobiography.

02:47.219 --> 02:50.803
The second book is not an autobiography either.

02:51.644 --> 02:54.707
I'm very different from the protagonist.

02:58.079 --> 03:04.088
I think that they were clearly influenced by autobiographical events, by events in your life.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.151
I think that's been fairly well established.

03:06.171 --> 03:27.141
I understand, but I think that whereas it's perfectly clear that I'm not Max or Charlie or Toby or God knows Laura, as Max saw it, there is nothing in that book that is not drawn

03:27.982 --> 03:30.446
from my experience.

03:30.566 --> 03:40.681
I find it very difficult to think of writing a book which I have not in some way lived.

03:41.943 --> 03:56.605
So I think that you could say that there is an autobiographical content and that the book comes out of what I've lived and observed rather than

03:57.462 --> 04:04.893
out of some storyline that I might have imagined and then hung some clothes upon.

04:04.913 --> 04:11.923
I'm not sure that perhaps it's a distinction without a difference, but it does make a difference to me.

04:11.983 --> 04:20.996
I think that all fiction of my sort comes out of one's life.

04:21.016 --> 04:23.880
You say fiction of my sort.

04:23.980 --> 04:25.883
How do you define that?

04:26.504 --> 04:33.092
fiction written by a serious writer in this part of the century.

04:35.014 --> 04:44.885
It's really modern, serious modern fiction.

04:45.326 --> 04:55.397
I don't mean to imply in the least that there is a line that you could trace through as Max saw it and say,

04:55.715 --> 04:58.298
This corresponds to what Begley did here or there.

04:58.919 --> 05:00.220
It doesn't.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.643
Except that I had lived to China, obviously.

05:02.663 --> 05:07.969
I did go to Harvard College, and I went to Harvard Law School.

05:08.089 --> 05:12.634
I spent a good deal of time in this part of the world, in Boston, Cambridge, and so on.

05:12.654 --> 05:25.148
So the things that are told in the book about whether it's China, Boston, or Cambridge, or the lakes,

05:25.634 --> 05:27.997
or Lake Como.

05:28.017 --> 05:32.862
There are places where... And this has to enter your writing, of course.

05:34.403 --> 05:50.160
To get back to your perception of what the novel is supposed to accomplish, apparently you do believe that the novel has a function beyond any kind of entertainment purpose.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.823
You're not writing merely to entertain.

05:53.140 --> 05:56.723
I would say, is that a fair statement?

05:56.743 --> 05:58.004
Well, I don't know.

05:58.024 --> 06:15.120
I don't know whether it's a fair statement because I do think that one writes, at least I write a novel, in order to tell a story that a reader will want to read and that I hope will entertain the reader.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.622
I did not write to preach.

06:17.342 --> 06:21.426
Now, necessarily, if one

06:22.672 --> 06:33.326
is successful in writing a novel, it will appeal to something in the mind and in the heart of the reader.

06:35.029 --> 06:41.557
It will work its own charms, if you like, on the reader.

06:42.379 --> 06:44.361
But I don't have a didactic purpose.

06:47.545 --> 06:52.392
I think that I'm closer to wanting to entertain and delight

06:53.030 --> 06:55.894
than to wanting to teach.

06:57.196 --> 07:11.899
Do you think that at this point in your adult life that, I mean, quite a bit has been made in the press, that you took up writing mid-life, mid-fifties, I guess?

07:11.919 --> 07:12.440
Yes.

07:13.922 --> 07:14.823
Writing took me up.

07:14.843 --> 07:18.649
I wonder if you could pick up on that.

07:20.468 --> 07:27.676
This isn't something that you either had the time or the inclination to do, say, when you're in your 30s or your 40s?

07:28.858 --> 07:34.584
Well, you know, it's very difficult to explain these things.

07:34.785 --> 07:35.986
I don't have an explanation.

07:36.767 --> 07:43.715
I think I was very much the same person in my 30s, in my 40s, as I was in my 50s.

07:44.476 --> 07:49.902
Obviously, the ravages of time, putting aside.

07:50.523 --> 08:02.977
And I'm not sure that I was any less busy during my 40s or 30s than I have been during my 50s in the country, I think, in some ways.

08:02.997 --> 08:13.069
I have worked harder at my legal work during my 50s than now than I ever did before.

08:14.070 --> 08:17.914
But for some reason,

08:18.333 --> 08:21.918
which I don't know what reason it is.

08:22.338 --> 08:29.067
I did not write a book before my mid-fifties.

08:29.227 --> 08:46.028
Perhaps there was something that was working its way through my subconscious, if you want to call it that, or perhaps it was a process of maturation, perhaps it was a change

08:46.835 --> 08:53.625
in me the nature of which is not known to me.

08:53.645 --> 08:57.130
I don't suggest for a moment that I'm an automatic writer.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.316
I just sit down, my pen moves.

09:01.476 --> 09:15.576
But honestly, for some reason, at the age, whatever age it was, I was in 89, I guess I was 55, I did

09:15.877 --> 09:28.671
write a book, and it had a liberating effect on me in the sense that it seems to have made me able to continue to write.

09:29.672 --> 09:38.082
Now, why that did not happen 10 years or 15 years earlier puzzles me just as much as it might puzzle you.

09:38.102 --> 09:40.905
I have no answer.

09:41.307 --> 09:43.549
This thing was almost written in a rush.

09:43.610 --> 09:48.034
I mean, this isn't something that you labored on for a period of... No, no, no.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.656
It was written not in a rush.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.279
I don't mean in a rush, but let's say in a sustained period.

09:52.299 --> 09:52.619
Yes, absolutely.

09:53.220 --> 09:59.347
I wrote every day, and I wrote rather... I don't mean to have suggested the work that it was rushed.

09:59.707 --> 10:00.528
No, no, no.

10:00.688 --> 10:02.430
I did not, in the least, take it that way.

10:02.450 --> 10:06.014
I mean, it is not... I'm trying to be somehow accurate.

10:06.114 --> 10:09.458
It is not as though I had sat down and...

10:09.691 --> 10:16.219
I felt some kind of floodgates had opened and prose rushed through.

10:16.720 --> 10:17.641
It wasn't like that.

10:17.661 --> 10:23.889
I simply sat down and I wrote each day.

10:23.909 --> 10:33.521
I finished within a relatively brief period of time, within three months.

10:34.202 --> 10:37.386
In that case, did you start with the character or with the experience?

10:38.075 --> 10:53.357
Well I think that I started with a point of view and I suppose a character because I was interested in a man who had been a child of a certain sort.

10:54.298 --> 11:01.228
So you might say that it was a character and the experience was of course right there.

11:02.410 --> 11:05.955
I was interested in what would be

11:07.994 --> 11:13.642
a man who had had a childhood of that particular sort.

11:13.662 --> 11:19.090
It turned out that I wrote about the child and not the man in that first book.

11:19.110 --> 11:37.798
But I started out with that conception of a man of a certain age who has had a series of

11:38.420 --> 11:41.424
Innocent, unspeakable experiences.

11:42.485 --> 11:47.872
And how was one to deal with that material?

11:47.892 --> 11:49.194
How would one organize it?

11:49.214 --> 11:51.497
How would one present it?

11:51.517 --> 11:55.522
That was the inception of that book.

11:56.523 --> 12:03.692
And in the case of The Man Who Was Late, my second novel... I'm sorry.

12:03.752 --> 12:07.617
I'm just checking myself to be sure if I... In the case of my second novel,

12:08.221 --> 12:36.000
it was clearly the start was not precisely a character the start was an incident the incident had to do with can one repair a misstep a

12:38.208 --> 12:55.712
an opportunity, can man catch up with an opportunity that was lost, an opportunity of tremendous emotional significance and of course that had to do with the character of a man and the protagonist, Ben.

12:55.732 --> 13:06.848
Once I had that, I knew exactly what Ben was like and what the problem with Ben was.

13:07.655 --> 13:14.683
Then from that, the narrative really outflowed inevitably, so it seemed to me.

13:14.703 --> 13:25.315
I know that abstractly it could have been told in many other ways, but that was the way in which I told it.

13:26.336 --> 13:30.400
And I did not hesitate very much about how I would tell it.

13:31.141 --> 13:36.227
And I must say that with respect to this last book, as Max saw it,

13:36.730 --> 14:06.130
that also began with an incident the illness and the death of a young man I had thought about and I wondered about the survivor what would the survivor feel and what would he do was something that so it was a character of the

14:06.582 --> 14:10.005
survivor that interested me.

14:10.046 --> 14:17.833
Well, but there's also quite a generational difference here, too, which comes into play.

14:17.853 --> 14:18.694
What do you mean by that?

14:18.714 --> 14:23.339
Well, the victim, obviously, and the survivor.

14:23.359 --> 14:31.507
I mean, we're talking about not necessarily a clash of generations, but perceptions.

14:31.527 --> 14:34.210
Maybe that's not part of the

14:35.202 --> 14:39.809
I hadn't thought of it this way.

14:40.810 --> 15:03.623
I simply was interested really in the question of friendship, solidarity, what one does when one

15:04.447 --> 15:14.176
witnesses the disappearance of someone, and a rather ghastly disappearance of someone who has loved.

15:14.196 --> 15:17.179
What are the reactions to it?

15:17.239 --> 15:32.513
So that book just started with the conception of a character, which to me is not terribly different from the conception point of view.

15:35.328 --> 15:42.457
I'm not sure that I'm answering as well as you would like me to, but I'm doing my best.

15:42.477 --> 15:43.479
No, we're doing fine.

15:43.739 --> 15:55.674
I'm really just... Let me say also, for me, the most challenging interviews are with novelists, because novels speak for themselves.

15:56.035 --> 15:57.857
Well, that's precisely my view, too.

15:58.057 --> 16:02.423
And it's so hard for me, and I really hate to ask you what a book is about, because that's my job.

16:02.663 --> 16:03.985
No, you see, I...

16:04.505 --> 16:18.062
I've always, ever since I was a young man when I was a college student, I've always been puzzled by the question of what is the book about?

16:18.082 --> 16:20.525
Well, I haven't tried to ask that question.

16:20.545 --> 16:29.156
I know, because I've often asked myself the question that's been asked to me, and I've always thought, well, it's about precisely what it says.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.520
So, in order to answer

16:33.192 --> 16:36.817
Or even what I think it says.

16:37.038 --> 16:41.905
I mean, again, reading a book is a one-on-one exercise.

16:43.207 --> 16:48.715
It's probably the only cultural exchange where a person goes one-on-one with the artist.

16:49.176 --> 16:55.325
So I am trying to get some material that will be useful for a feature piece.

16:55.706 --> 16:58.570
I think you and I see it very much the same way.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.035
Thank you.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.090
Not at all.

17:07.575 --> 17:10.059
You're fluent in a number of languages.

17:12.983 --> 17:15.707
Do you write and you think in English?

17:16.328 --> 17:31.971
Well, I certainly write in English, and I think in English, except when I'm speaking to my wife or some of my children, in which case I think in French.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.661
You do think in French.

17:34.681 --> 17:36.383
For sure.

17:36.763 --> 17:42.048
If you speak a language very well, you obviously have to think in that language.

17:42.388 --> 17:44.870
You don't sit there and translate.

17:44.890 --> 17:49.254
And when I speak to my mother or somebody who's Polish, I think in Polish.

17:50.615 --> 18:00.664
And I'm not really completely fluent in any language except those three.

18:00.684 --> 18:02.025
I can get along in all languages.

18:02.444 --> 18:08.911
But I'm not sure ever whether I think in them or don't think in them.

18:08.931 --> 18:16.660
Whereas in those three languages, obviously, when I speak French, I start thinking French.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.982
I don't think in English.

18:20.103 --> 18:23.747
It's not like I'm trying to stretch to Joseph Cartwright here either.

18:24.808 --> 18:31.776
Well, he's, I think, somewhat different in that he learned English a little later.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.701
in life than I did, I believe.

18:34.861 --> 18:38.004
But then it became so painstaking, though, in his choice of language.

18:38.024 --> 18:39.066
Yes.

18:39.086 --> 18:39.606
Yes.

18:39.626 --> 18:50.618
Well, I had never any doubt that if I were to write, I would write in English simply because my education has opened in English.

18:50.638 --> 18:54.903
I hardly had any education before.

18:54.923 --> 19:02.151
Well, not really getting into the novel itself, but in terms of the stylistic devices that you use, I was interested in that.

19:02.536 --> 19:06.400
front half of the book, you really don't quote directly, you paraphrase.

19:07.221 --> 19:10.985
Well, he says, but you don't really use quotation marks, I guess.

19:11.105 --> 19:17.912
Oh, there's lots of dialogue in it, and it's direct dialogue, but I don't use quotation marks for a very simple reason.

19:17.932 --> 19:21.575
I don't like the looks of quotation marks.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.180
It's very different from what I did in Wartime Lives.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.962
Right, but there are quotes at the back of the book.

19:27.982 --> 19:28.182
Never.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.125
I've got quotation marks.

19:32.050 --> 19:35.034
Please continue.

19:35.074 --> 19:38.939
I've never used quotation marks in this book.

19:39.039 --> 19:40.781
There's some right there, for instance.

19:42.704 --> 19:48.932
That is because I'm quoting from the text of Verdi's.

19:49.373 --> 19:53.979
I don't use quotation marks for that.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.601
And that's just because you don't like them?

19:55.901 --> 19:56.282
That's right.

19:56.662 --> 19:57.063
It's simply that.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.224
It's got nothing to do with that.

19:58.244 --> 20:01.028
No, I just simply don't like the looks.

20:02.122 --> 20:05.307
And that's the sole reason.

20:06.408 --> 20:22.231
But that's the explanation for no quotation marks in either as Max saw it or in Wartime Lies.

20:22.251 --> 20:24.394
Or the man who was late.

20:25.395 --> 20:30.222
In Wartime Lies, I really did avoid direct dialogue.

20:30.590 --> 20:42.381
for a very specific reason, which is that I did not want to... What do you want?

20:42.401 --> 20:57.235
I did not want to try to write what was in my ear Polish dialogue in English, and particularly a child dialogue.

20:58.696 --> 21:00.478
I did not think it would sound

21:01.353 --> 21:03.156
true to me, authentic.

21:03.176 --> 21:15.473
And I don't like baby English, so I went to an enormous amount of trouble to make almost all the dialogue indirect.

21:15.954 --> 21:25.166
But I have no desire at all to do that, as Max thought, which is full of dialogue.

21:25.186 --> 21:26.368
Oh, it's full of dialogue.

21:26.388 --> 21:27.470
I didn't mean it existed.

21:27.490 --> 21:27.990
It wasn't.

21:28.010 --> 21:28.491
No, no, no.

21:28.511 --> 21:30.434
It's just that I don't use quotation marks.

21:30.454 --> 21:31.275
You don't use quotation marks.

21:31.390 --> 21:45.445
Do you think all of your books as a whole, are they all part of a continuum?

21:46.506 --> 21:47.707
Well, I don't think so.

21:49.109 --> 21:51.612
I think that they're really quite separate.

21:53.454 --> 21:59.440
They're certainly unified by my own sensibility and by the things

22:00.230 --> 22:02.873
that interest me.

22:02.893 --> 22:05.377
The themes that interest me.

22:05.537 --> 22:14.929
But I'm not writing the Comédie We Men, if that's what you think, or the Barchester novels.

22:15.870 --> 22:18.874
But they certainly are continuing.

22:18.934 --> 22:23.960
You seem to be very interested in exploring the dark side of human nature.

22:24.421 --> 22:25.502
Well, I think that's true.

22:25.602 --> 22:28.566
I am.

22:29.407 --> 22:42.788
I don't want to sound pompous, I don't want to sound pompous, but I've always been a very cheerful person and a rather optimistic person.

22:42.948 --> 22:43.950
You are optimistic.

22:43.970 --> 22:44.771
Oh, very much so.

22:45.051 --> 22:57.591
But I've always been, in my personal life, but I've always been very conscious of mortality, of the unspeakable

22:58.651 --> 23:20.594
things that human beings are capable of doing to each other, of the horror, tragedy that lurks constantly around one misstep that you fall into well.

23:22.636 --> 23:27.561
That's something I cannot see life in another way.

23:28.081 --> 23:33.449
when I allow myself to do so.

23:34.350 --> 23:37.655
And it's simply the other side of me.

23:39.198 --> 23:57.565
In daily life, in the way I conduct my own existence, the extent that anybody conducts their existence of, as I said, cheerful, optimistic, always think there is a solution

23:57.730 --> 24:03.375
I'm quite happy.

24:03.655 --> 24:11.102
In fact, I'm very happy in my personal life.

24:11.122 --> 24:18.448
But that is not somehow how I think about it.

24:18.468 --> 24:23.533
But these novels, and I'm talking about all of them now, they don't spring from a sense of optimism, do they?

24:23.793 --> 24:26.235
No, but as I'm trying to tell you,

24:26.620 --> 24:53.691
There seems to be a division between me as a functioning person who always thinks that somehow things will work out, that I will manage, that things can be arranged, that in the end

24:54.481 --> 25:24.488
there is a good solution for whatever is before me which is my sort of operational mode and the me who writes or the me who observes because when I observe things I see the very ugly dark side of things but then there is a me who somehow leaves that fellow traveler and

25:25.261 --> 25:27.924
That's the one who always catches the cab.

25:28.704 --> 25:32.128
The cab needs to be caught in the rain.

25:33.789 --> 25:38.834
Figures out some way to have a pleasant time.

25:40.075 --> 25:44.219
Finds a solution for a client to make legal work and does not give up.

25:46.001 --> 25:50.605
You're very committed to the legal profession.

25:51.366 --> 25:54.289
There definitely are two

25:54.370 --> 25:55.872
Oh, yes, enormously.

25:56.673 --> 25:59.056
Enormously, enormously committed to it.

25:59.076 --> 26:03.242
And when you're practicing law, you're practicing law, and the writer is someplace else.

26:03.282 --> 26:13.335
The writer is somewhere else, except that the writer is obviously there looking on, taking notes.

26:13.395 --> 26:13.676
Really?

26:14.056 --> 26:14.357
Oh, sure.

26:16.239 --> 26:16.940
Taking notes.

26:18.402 --> 26:21.306
Figuratively speaking, I hardly ever take notes anyway.

26:23.041 --> 26:26.927
But you didn't take this up as a form of recreation, I gather.

26:26.947 --> 26:27.588
Which, writing?

26:27.668 --> 26:27.968
Writing.

26:28.049 --> 26:29.290
No, not at all.

26:31.273 --> 26:41.969
I feel so stupid about it, but I have no explanation for why I began to write it.

26:42.470 --> 26:51.023
It was not as though I had been going along and saying to myself, look, just wait for an opportunity.

26:51.256 --> 26:53.539
and he would sit down to write a novel.

26:53.639 --> 26:56.163
I never thought I would.

26:56.684 --> 27:01.511
And I did not mourn that fact.

27:01.531 --> 27:04.475
I simply took it for a given.

27:04.495 --> 27:09.102
And that is not to say that I would not have liked to.

27:09.122 --> 27:11.866
I just did not think that I would.

27:12.767 --> 27:20.098
And there's never been a novel that I began and threw away or that I put in my drawer or sent something

27:21.108 --> 27:23.190
So there's no frustrated novelist in you, I mean.

27:23.210 --> 27:28.236
Well, there isn't really, because everything I've written has been published.

27:28.256 --> 27:29.858
That's quite great.

27:30.258 --> 27:36.005
Except some short stories when I was a kid, and I never submitted for publication.

27:36.165 --> 27:41.551
But literally, I've never had anything rejected.

27:41.591 --> 27:42.312
That's amazing.

27:42.492 --> 27:46.396
Did you write the first novel with a commitment from a publisher?

27:46.516 --> 27:47.217
Well, not at all.

27:47.905 --> 28:17.170
Not at all, I just wrote it and I wasn't at all sure that I would even seek to publish it because I had, and I've said this before to some interviewer, I had a question in my mind which in retrospect does not seem to have been a very intelligent question, but I had it nonetheless.

28:17.386 --> 28:25.417
whether it was alright to make a novel out of that experience.

28:25.478 --> 28:46.768
Was one not obliged if one was going to write about, although I use that word, the Holocaust, was one not obliged to write as a memorialist seeking for the most faithful reproduction of what

28:47.272 --> 28:53.738
You may find that this was a silly question.

28:53.858 --> 28:58.902
Maybe it was, but it tormented me.

28:59.023 --> 29:04.267
And I knew I was writing a novel, but I was not writing my memoirs.

29:05.929 --> 29:12.855
And so when I finished, my wife reads everything I read as I go along.

29:13.055 --> 29:16.198
I mean, reads everything I write.

29:16.769 --> 29:18.892
that writes everything I read.

29:19.934 --> 29:30.010
And I kept on putting that question to her, and she kept on saying, as I said, of course, you should write your novel and don't worry about it.

29:30.030 --> 29:43.671
And then I put the question to a friend of mine who's a writer who I respect enormously, and he told me that he didn't understand

29:44.528 --> 29:46.791
the nature of the moral problem.

29:46.811 --> 29:55.941
And I came to think myself that there was no moral problem because I certainly treated the material with the greatest respect.

29:57.223 --> 30:02.930
So I then decided to be published.

30:03.871 --> 30:05.393
And so it was.

30:05.453 --> 30:11.640
And the other books I certainly don't have to read because I had a contract.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.561
I just wrote them.

30:13.553 --> 30:17.918
I gave it to my agent.

30:18.418 --> 30:25.445
I suppose Knopf had an option in my books, but it was never an issue.

30:25.466 --> 30:32.473
Did the response to that, I mean, obviously the first book had an extraordinary critical response.

30:32.633 --> 30:36.137
In some ways the second one had the better.

30:36.497 --> 30:38.739
It did, but I mean, that wasn't a surprise, though.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.143
After the first one it was a surprise.

30:42.680 --> 30:46.104
Were you surprised by this?

30:47.105 --> 30:53.211
I was in a sort of a state of happy anesthesia.

30:55.854 --> 31:02.962
I was so pleasantly surprised that I began to stop having any feelings about it.

31:02.982 --> 31:06.586
It seemed to be quite extraordinary.

31:08.849 --> 31:11.151
I've always been worried about

31:11.772 --> 31:18.358
being too pleased about anything is because of deeply superstitious.

31:18.378 --> 31:18.759
You are?

31:18.779 --> 31:21.121
Yes, it's terribly superstitious.

31:21.141 --> 31:30.270
And I always think if you say, oh, this is wonderful, it's going to come up and slug you.

31:31.511 --> 31:34.033
Are you superstitious on a day-to-day basis?

31:34.114 --> 31:35.215
Oh, yes, absolutely.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.758
I'm terrified.

31:39.346 --> 31:53.702
For instance, I don't know if there's two positions, particularly Polish, or whether it's a general one, but in Poland it's not good to turn back to your house after you've set out in the morning.

31:54.503 --> 32:08.779
So, for instance, if I leave my house and I've not taken my umbrella with me and it's raining, it requires a tremendous effort of will to go back to get my umbrella.

32:09.248 --> 32:17.956
Yeah, I'm of Greek heritage, and the Greeks feel if you go in one door in a house you have to go out the same door.

32:18.296 --> 32:20.218
Well, I'm full of these.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.039
It's ridiculous.

32:21.059 --> 32:22.841
You see people falling over themselves.

32:23.221 --> 32:26.864
You know, you want to let them out the front door, and they came in at the back door.

32:28.726 --> 32:31.249
And it's kind of funny.

32:31.269 --> 32:38.175
Are you gratified by the response so many people show to serious fiction?

32:38.476 --> 32:44.565
You look at the bestseller list, and it's just so depressing to see the books that are up there week after week.

32:44.846 --> 32:47.450
Well, yes, I am enormously gratified by that.

32:48.111 --> 32:52.237
First of all, I love the response of my friends.

32:52.277 --> 32:53.940
My friends have liked my books.

32:54.661 --> 32:57.465
My family has liked my books.

32:57.485 --> 32:59.628
That is marvelous.

32:59.648 --> 33:02.954
It's the greatest joy possible.

33:02.974 --> 33:07.200
And particularly my friends who I know have both

33:09.712 --> 33:15.960
high moral standard and a high literary standard.

33:15.980 --> 33:19.465
And it is that which I think is the greatest reward.

33:20.547 --> 33:39.432
And the responsive readers who write to me, when I meet them, who say things that are enormously perceptive, that make me certain that they've read the book correctly.

33:39.833 --> 33:45.018
and responded in a way that I think one should respond.

33:45.639 --> 33:48.582
It's simply wonderful.

33:48.702 --> 33:53.787
And I think to learn that there are still some serious readers left in the world.

33:53.928 --> 33:54.088
Yes.

33:54.929 --> 33:56.030
Absolutely.

33:56.050 --> 33:56.370
Absolutely.

33:56.550 --> 33:58.873
And there are lots of them.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.595
Young ones, old ones.

34:01.956 --> 34:08.743
People you wouldn't think read, but who suddenly tell you, I've read your book three times.

34:09.145 --> 34:13.010
who write very long letters.

34:15.274 --> 34:17.677
It's a marvelous thing.

34:17.697 --> 34:24.647
And I don't have any fears for the future of the novel.

34:24.867 --> 34:30.095
I don't think it's going to be replaced by comic strips.

34:30.115 --> 34:30.836
Who do you read?

34:31.937 --> 34:38.106
Well, I read very little new fiction than last because I have

34:38.879 --> 34:45.345
limited time for reading, so I mostly reread.

34:45.365 --> 35:00.078
I seem to be, generally speaking, sort of stuck in, as far as novels go, in the Proust, James, Balzac, Trollope, Dickens, Dostoyevsky.

35:00.979 --> 35:01.540
Well, it does.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.801
You're writing this thing.

35:02.821 --> 35:06.304
It's not derivative of anything contemporary, which is probably

35:07.583 --> 35:09.364
validates what you're saying right now.

35:09.525 --> 35:15.029
I mean, your writing doesn't seem to be... I should add Conrad.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.751
I should definitely add Conrad.

35:17.852 --> 35:23.276
Do you consider yourself... I mean, there is an American literary tradition.

35:23.656 --> 35:27.019
Do you consider yourself a part of that?

35:28.020 --> 35:37.388
Yes, I mean, I would be very happy to think that I am in the sort of tradition that

35:38.347 --> 35:52.208
It goes from Hawthorne, to James, to Horton, to Nathaniel West.

35:53.630 --> 35:54.111
He smiled.

35:54.571 --> 35:55.473
Yes.

35:55.493 --> 35:58.658
To R. Scott Fitzgerald.

35:58.678 --> 35:58.938
Hello?

36:00.861 --> 36:02.884
But you're naming all American ladies.

36:03.144 --> 36:04.486
Well, you said American.

36:04.566 --> 36:06.970
I did, but you...

36:07.372 --> 36:10.295
responding in that fashion.

36:10.315 --> 36:20.125
I left out James because I think it was a sort of—he's a totally American writer, but he's in a computer position.

36:20.165 --> 36:23.169
He really is, isn't he?

36:23.189 --> 36:25.952
He jumps on both sides, so to speak.

36:27.773 --> 36:34.020
I'm writing for a number of newspapers who take my feature now.

36:34.422 --> 36:37.987
And one publication I'm writing for, the Summer Scampton's Magazine.

36:38.007 --> 36:38.488
Oh, really?

36:38.768 --> 36:39.409
On Long Island.

36:39.449 --> 36:43.295
And I'm so really, pardon me if I try to stretch and... Not at all.

36:43.315 --> 36:44.677
Do you ever come out there?

36:44.697 --> 36:49.144
I've never been there, as a matter of fact.

36:49.164 --> 36:58.978
But I do understand that you spend quite a bit of time out there, and I'm really... I wish I spent a great... I'm going to try and, you know, pitch the... I don't know how I can really...

36:59.566 --> 37:08.436
I mean, I think just the fact that you do spend a lot of time out there is justifying this as a... I have to give them a list of articles that I'll be doing for them.

37:08.936 --> 37:09.417
Sure.

37:09.437 --> 37:18.627
If you could just give me a little bit of background about... Well, I have a house which is on the wrong side of tracks in Sagatonic.

37:19.428 --> 37:29.539
It's in the sort of scrub bulk that grows where the glacier passed and pushed the...

37:29.755 --> 37:32.918
It's a wonderful house.

37:33.158 --> 37:38.784
It was built by a very gifted architect.

37:40.526 --> 37:46.392
It's extremely simple to live in, flooded with light at night.

37:46.412 --> 37:48.915
Always cheerful.

37:50.076 --> 37:57.163
I like the most trouble because it means we never see any neighbors.

37:58.730 --> 38:13.545
We never have the sense of the sometimes frenetic life of the habitants intruding on us.

38:13.565 --> 38:21.213
But at the same time the beach is so near and it is the most beautiful beach in the world.

38:22.254 --> 38:28.180
I think probably among the least spoiled beaches.

38:28.970 --> 38:35.881
our life in Sakaponik, which is where our house is very simple.

38:35.901 --> 38:38.105
My wife is a writer also.

38:38.125 --> 38:38.665
I know that.

38:38.826 --> 38:52.868
And so we both sort of do whatever we're doing and we do a minimum of shopping just enough to sustain the body.

38:52.888 --> 38:56.614
And we go for it.

38:56.982 --> 39:01.927
We do a huge long walk on the beach twice a day and we swim in the ocean.

39:01.947 --> 39:02.868
Does the beach have a name?

39:03.609 --> 39:16.242
Well, it's really the stretch of beach that goes from Georgica to Bridgehampton.

39:17.664 --> 39:19.706
And we pace up and down it.

39:19.726 --> 39:22.249
We love to swim in the ocean.

39:22.269 --> 39:25.572
And we now have two grandchildren.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.171
come out quite a lot.

39:28.252 --> 39:38.182
We have actually two houses, one next to the other, so the grandchildren are in the other house.

39:38.202 --> 39:51.234
We might say we have two houses and one ate because we just constructed a tree house of which we're extremely proud for grandchildren.

39:51.254 --> 39:54.377
And so we love that place.

39:55.572 --> 40:12.307
We find that going out here for the normal two-day weekend is an experience that's so totally refreshing and restorative.

40:14.469 --> 40:16.571
It's been the best thing.

40:16.991 --> 40:19.293
Have you done much writing out there?

40:19.373 --> 40:19.754
Oh, yes.

40:19.894 --> 40:24.398
I mean, I only write on weekends and on vacations.

40:24.817 --> 40:30.225
I spend as many weekends as I can out there.

40:30.265 --> 40:35.694
Most of my writing has been done out there.

40:35.734 --> 40:36.235
That's great.

40:36.255 --> 40:40.201
Well, that's something I can get into here.

40:40.221 --> 40:50.717
Do you feel that having been this novelist has really added a dimension to your life, an unexpected dimension to your life?

40:50.897 --> 40:52.760
It's been absolutely wonderful.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.541
I like to write.

40:54.230 --> 41:11.247
A lot of writers find writing, I think, macerating, lacerating experience.

41:11.267 --> 41:12.549
I don't.

41:12.569 --> 41:21.638
I find it a release and a great deal of satisfaction.

41:22.715 --> 41:29.262
a dimension of happiness to my life to be able to write.

41:30.723 --> 41:52.705
And there's no question that the fact of having been able to write things that people consider successful is a very wonderful feeling.

41:53.495 --> 42:03.331
I trust I have not become any more conceited than I've always been.

42:04.152 --> 42:05.374
So I don't think it's that.

42:06.255 --> 42:16.672
It's simply that it's satisfying to discover that you can do something that you did not know that you can do.

42:16.692 --> 42:20.498
It's satisfying to be able to go on doing it.

42:21.727 --> 42:24.190
I always thought I was rather a good lawyer.

42:25.231 --> 42:31.598
And that is quite a satisfying thing in itself, the sense of doing a job well.

42:33.060 --> 42:40.749
It's not, the two are not unlike each other.

42:40.769 --> 42:42.010
My brother's attorney.

42:42.470 --> 42:43.271
Yes?

42:45.354 --> 42:48.257
I'm kind of surprised that you say that

42:49.317 --> 42:50.979
The law and writing are similar.

42:51.019 --> 42:54.524
No, I'm saying the satisfaction of doing something well.

42:54.624 --> 43:01.114
I will absolutely agree with that.

43:02.996 --> 43:08.103
When you began the book, did you have it pretty much in focus?

43:08.444 --> 43:09.606
Did you know where it was going?

43:10.146 --> 43:12.810
Which book?

43:13.246 --> 43:14.768
There was no mystery.

43:14.788 --> 43:18.593
This wasn't a road of self-discovery for yourself as you were going along.

43:18.793 --> 43:19.974
Oh, no at all.

43:20.996 --> 43:28.485
In each one of my books I knew exactly what I was going to do.

43:28.505 --> 43:39.979
I told you 85% of what was going to happen along the way.

43:41.191 --> 43:48.518
I don't know how else one—I could not sit down and write something if I did not know where I was going.

43:48.538 --> 43:52.322
This runs so counter to what so many other writers have to say, doesn't it?

43:52.342 --> 43:54.344
Yes, I know, but— This is wonderful.

43:54.444 --> 43:56.887
I'm enjoying it.

43:56.987 --> 43:58.128
It surprises me.

43:59.369 --> 44:05.295
You really couldn't imagine starting a novel unless you knew where it was taking— No, no.

44:05.375 --> 44:09.139
I know that there are people who do just sit down

44:09.980 --> 44:11.242
start going somewhere.

44:11.963 --> 44:12.904
I could not do that.

44:13.305 --> 44:15.408
Your characters don't change on you.

44:15.448 --> 44:17.090
They're pretty much under control.

44:17.391 --> 44:21.597
I think one does learn some new things about them.

44:22.578 --> 44:30.490
And obviously there are some inventions that simply come along.

44:31.411 --> 44:38.181
But those are more in the nature of, for me, they're more in the nature of

44:38.887 --> 44:50.488
the writing of the presentation, the description of the dialogue, if you like, just funny things that occur to them.

44:50.508 --> 44:59.604
But I know precisely what's going to happen and how people are going to behave and what they're going to do.

44:59.704 --> 45:01.447
Do you have your next novel pretty much in mind?

45:01.467 --> 45:02.970
Well, I do as an author.

45:05.060 --> 45:10.609
And I don't expect you to talk about it, because I know... No, it's too soon.

45:10.709 --> 45:16.658
And also, it would run against my superstitious principles.

45:16.678 --> 45:17.820
No, and that I appreciate.

45:17.960 --> 45:27.014
And frankly, when you try and give a one or two sentence description of a work in progress, it always sounds silly.

45:27.034 --> 45:28.356
You can't do it.

45:28.376 --> 45:31.962
Besides, as we said at the beginning, how does one describe

45:32.701 --> 45:36.686
a book, for instance, if you say, what is war and peace about?

45:36.707 --> 45:37.387
It's about war.

45:38.229 --> 45:40.712
It's like saying, Hamlet is a revenge play.

45:40.752 --> 45:43.616
That's right.

45:43.636 --> 45:53.570
You know, he's talking about a man who's lost his father.

45:53.730 --> 45:54.291
Okay.

45:54.351 --> 45:58.156
Well, I don't want to pick up too much of your time.

45:59.137 --> 46:02.522
I have the work, and that's number one.

46:05.118 --> 46:07.701
If I have any other questions, I'm sure I'll be able to get in touch with you.

46:07.721 --> 46:09.584
Well, you can call me.

46:09.604 --> 46:11.747
Will you give me a phone number?

46:11.767 --> 46:13.289
Best to call me at the office.

46:13.309 --> 46:13.509
Okay.

46:14.010 --> 46:19.256
It's 212-909-6273.

46:19.276 --> 46:21.039
6273?

46:21.359 --> 46:23.101
Yes, but I won't be there next week.

46:23.121 --> 46:23.802
Okay.

46:25.284 --> 46:34.416
I'll be writing, as I mentioned, I have a half a dozen papers that take me every week, and I will be doing a piece for Hamptons, which starts over Memorial Day, and it'll be shortly thereafter.

46:35.341 --> 46:39.330
So I think whatever questions I might have would really be for that piece.

46:39.851 --> 46:42.116
There will be a different piece.

46:42.136 --> 46:44.261
And I'm really delighted to be in there.

46:44.281 --> 46:44.802
Of course.

46:45.023 --> 46:46.647
It's a nice little outland for me.

46:47.007 --> 46:48.591
I don't think I need any more.
