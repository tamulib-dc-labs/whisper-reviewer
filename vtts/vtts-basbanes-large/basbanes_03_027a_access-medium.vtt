WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:05.244
I'm talking to Daniel Aaron here.

00:05.264 --> 00:06.305
I'll just put this up here.

00:06.345 --> 00:07.167
Don't even think about it.

00:07.187 --> 00:07.888
It's just there.

00:07.988 --> 00:08.409
All right.

00:09.971 --> 00:11.433
I might check it periodically.

00:11.734 --> 00:13.376
So you're saying you opened this memoir?

00:13.997 --> 00:14.318
Yes.

00:14.418 --> 00:15.079
Well, this is it.

00:16.221 --> 00:20.327
I have some books here, which I'll show you, that were heard.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.631
We had dozens of them.

00:22.651 --> 00:27.919
But this is the kind of sort of thing at the Royclaw shop.

00:27.979 --> 00:31.084
Yeah, these are famous.

00:31.334 --> 00:35.198
He regarded her as his sort of foster daughter.

00:35.399 --> 00:37.882
He called her the Whitman girl, things like that.

00:38.142 --> 00:45.911
It's a sort of poor man's William Morris.

00:47.893 --> 00:50.056
It's not quite right, you know.

00:51.337 --> 01:00.868
It has an element of fakery, I think, in everything that he did.

01:02.030 --> 01:04.653
something of the huckster, of the manufacturer.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.736
Uh, yeah.

01:07.897 --> 01:11.681
It's right in the back of the, uh, very nice.

01:12.201 --> 01:12.962
One of one hundred.

01:14.364 --> 01:14.925
Yes.

01:14.945 --> 01:16.006
Yeah, just to be clear.

01:16.286 --> 01:20.611
And, um... Yeah.

01:21.632 --> 01:30.562
That was, it was a, and it's in a way, uh, I say now, looking back on it, uh, I guess my first introduction to American history.

01:31.103 --> 01:31.243
Really?

01:31.696 --> 01:41.370
Yeah, because of this thing he wrote, you know, the message to Garcia, which hundreds and hundreds of thousands of copies were printed.

01:41.731 --> 01:42.893
And we all had to read it.

01:42.973 --> 01:43.313
Yes.

01:43.914 --> 01:44.395
You read it.

01:44.415 --> 01:45.296
Did you ever read it?

01:45.637 --> 01:47.319
Oh, absolutely.

01:47.339 --> 01:49.082
In high school and perhaps.

01:49.102 --> 01:49.462
Did you?

01:49.542 --> 01:50.043
Definitely.

01:50.063 --> 01:52.707
I was an English major in college.

01:53.909 --> 01:54.750
I read it for sure.

01:55.085 --> 01:55.505
Really?

01:55.746 --> 01:56.206
I'm sure.

01:56.486 --> 01:57.927
How else would I know it?

01:57.988 --> 01:58.768
Well, it was red.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.630
I mean, it was, you know, it was bruited.

02:00.690 --> 02:12.861
It was all the big companies put it in their pay envelopes, and it was used by the Russian army and the German army for the soldiers.

02:13.861 --> 02:14.142
Really?

02:14.162 --> 02:14.502
Yes.

02:15.263 --> 02:16.464
Just a small little pamphlet.

02:16.544 --> 02:17.525
But what was it used there?

02:17.545 --> 02:18.926
What was the function, do you think?

02:19.366 --> 02:20.267
The function was?

02:22.729 --> 02:24.771
See, this is the kind of thing I'm interested in.

02:25.223 --> 02:36.600
Yes, this is the ... Are you going to mind, by the way, if I shoot a couple of pictures of you as well?

02:37.261 --> 02:37.942
No.

02:41.307 --> 02:54.927
There's a ... The quickest way to do it is to ...

02:55.109 --> 03:02.837
I have a quotation from the, at the beginning of the book.

03:07.362 --> 03:08.183
This is about my mother.

03:08.203 --> 03:12.728
I have no idea when or where she met him.

03:12.828 --> 03:21.117
My guess would be at Jane Adams's whole house in Chicago, or by what step she got to East Aurora, nor can I reconcile my mother's patron.

03:21.400 --> 03:35.555
with the inspired author of the message to Garcia, 1899, that tough thumping track against sloth and incompetence, inspired by an incident in the Spanish-American War, and distributed in the millions by governments and industries around the world.

03:36.797 --> 03:40.821
As Hubbard tells it, this is it, so this will save the time.

03:43.124 --> 03:50.732
President McKinley, after many failures, at last finds the right man to deliver an important message to the commander of the human insurgents, General Garcia.

03:51.505 --> 03:56.513
The young officer doesn't waste the president's time by asking him a lot of fool questions.

03:56.533 --> 04:01.821
Jumped on the Cuban coast, he cuts through jungles, climbs mountains, evades Spanish troops.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.744
Four weeks later, he locates Garcia.

04:04.304 --> 04:08.431
A first message became a kind of media event and brought him international fame.

04:08.771 --> 04:13.799
By the time I read it, serious social historians had written him off as an inspired quack and huster.

04:16.383 --> 04:16.483
Uh...

04:20.041 --> 04:25.846
To label him as snake oil salesman, however, should not discount his importance as a guide to the culturally insecure.

04:25.866 --> 04:33.813
He had more than a touch of Benjamin Franklin and Phineas T. Barnum's sly impudence, and like them, used it to deflate his patronizers.

04:33.833 --> 04:38.337
The audience he attracted and delighted lived somewhat beyond the pale of the cultural establishment.

04:38.898 --> 04:50.048
It consisted largely of outsiders like himself, the intellectually alert and mildly nonconformist people of modern means, the self-educated graduates of Hubbard's alma mater, the University of Hard Knocks,

04:50.855 --> 04:57.882
My private Albert Hubbard is still a shadowy composite of secondhand stories and fuzzy recollections.

04:58.642 --> 05:06.530
Not the brassy public relations pioneer, but the friendly bookish man who invited my mother to join him and the other Raycrofters at work and play.

05:07.611 --> 05:19.562
Something of the community's period charm and high-minded Victorianism emanates from the autographs and messages in my mother's album and from the volumes of our library signed by Fra Albertus himself.

05:20.048 --> 05:21.130
That's great.

05:21.610 --> 05:21.851
Yeah.

05:21.891 --> 05:23.854
That's fascinating.

05:23.874 --> 05:36.072
And actually, the theme of it is, in a way, will be how I became a kind of an Americanization of it.

05:36.092 --> 05:41.981
I mean, coming from an immigrant background and then becoming part of the United States.

05:42.021 --> 05:43.744
And that's the theme that goes all the way through it.

05:43.943 --> 05:47.448
And then, of course, you pioneered this whole concept of American Studies.

05:47.468 --> 05:49.170
Well, and I was one of them.

05:49.190 --> 05:49.731
Well, well.

05:49.991 --> 05:50.993
Yeah.

05:51.013 --> 05:53.456
But nevertheless, this is quite... Yeah.

05:53.516 --> 05:57.882
And it's everywhere you go now, American Studies is... Yeah.

05:57.902 --> 06:02.809
Well, I think that's why I think The American is a good title for my book.

06:02.829 --> 06:03.630
It's wonderful.

06:03.690 --> 06:04.532
It's more to the point.

06:04.552 --> 06:05.513
It's more to the point, yeah.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.851
You know, where I have a title for my last book, Patience and Fortitude.

06:09.191 --> 06:11.613
Some people think it's a Jane Austen novel.

06:11.793 --> 06:12.134
Yeah, yeah.

06:12.454 --> 06:14.576
What's Patience and Fortitude?

06:14.596 --> 06:15.937
Well, that's it.

06:16.197 --> 06:21.642
It's kind of an essayist take and Bush-ish kind of suggestion, people picking it up.

06:21.662 --> 06:26.747
You expect to... Well, I don't know what you'd like, but I think The Americanist really is right on point.

06:27.307 --> 06:30.130
It's wonderful.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.531
I can't wait to see it.

06:31.812 --> 06:34.394
And so you're pretty much finished up with it?

06:34.974 --> 06:35.635
You're happy with it?

06:37.066 --> 06:38.267
Well, I don't know.

06:39.709 --> 06:45.035
It's a little bit, you know, the mountain laboring and producing the mouse.

06:45.676 --> 06:54.306
I've been working on off and on for four or five years, going away from it coming back, redoing it, taking it all to pieces.

06:55.188 --> 06:57.891
I call it a sort of the Penelopean method.

06:57.951 --> 07:02.857
I take it down at night and reassemble it.

07:03.097 --> 07:04.999
You'll see that phrase in my book.

07:05.019 --> 07:05.740
That's excellent.

07:06.344 --> 07:17.279
As an entry point into the conversation, you talk about becoming, the shaping, the creation of an Americanist, especially one who springs from immigrant roots.

07:17.359 --> 07:20.803
How does reading play a role in this?

07:20.824 --> 07:33.060
Well, because both my parents were readers, and the library was an important thing, and when we came to Los Angeles, and I was

07:36.854 --> 07:37.655
six years old.

07:39.017 --> 07:43.884
And, um, uh, my father was an invalid.

07:43.904 --> 07:45.346
My mother became an invalid.

07:45.366 --> 07:45.847
They died.

07:46.648 --> 07:47.629
Yeah, we were young.

07:47.649 --> 07:48.691
Yeah, we were in Chicago, yeah.

07:48.791 --> 07:50.634
We died to ten.

07:50.654 --> 07:59.326
And, uh, but my mother had been an invalid in a sanitarium, sanatorium in, um, California.

07:59.987 --> 08:03.011
And, and my father had multiple sclerosis, and he died.

08:03.031 --> 08:05.595
He held on for a year after she died.

08:06.368 --> 08:07.810
But they were both dead by 1922.

08:07.990 --> 08:11.135
Then I went to Chicago.

08:11.595 --> 08:13.238
And then that was it.

08:13.278 --> 08:20.228
My whole world was in the world of reading, because I think I never thought, I'm beginning to think about all these things I never thought about before.

08:20.448 --> 08:25.275
I'm not being an orphan, for example, what it means, and compared to people with mothers and fathers.

08:25.295 --> 08:26.396
Did you have any siblings?

08:26.416 --> 08:26.637
Yeah.

08:27.358 --> 08:29.561
We were broken apart, finally.

08:30.682 --> 08:32.965
And we all went off by ourselves, pretty much.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.190
Although we all cling together in our way.

08:36.828 --> 08:40.493
Even though we were separated, we were very close.

08:40.994 --> 08:48.004
And my oldest sister got a year ago, a year and a half ago.

08:48.024 --> 08:48.945
That's 67.

08:49.987 --> 08:55.334
And my, we're all 30, although my mother and father died very young.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.958
There are three of us still.

08:59.701 --> 09:00.682
All of us over 90.

09:02.485 --> 09:02.625
Wow.

09:02.645 --> 09:03.847
How old are you, might I ask?

09:03.867 --> 09:04.608
I'm 92.

09:05.189 --> 09:06.210
God bless you.

09:08.097 --> 09:10.841
My father just passed away last year in 91.

09:11.442 --> 09:11.783
Yeah.

09:11.803 --> 09:14.407
And he was wonderful.

09:14.427 --> 09:18.713
He lived a full life, healthy one day and gone the next.

09:18.733 --> 09:19.574
Really?

09:19.594 --> 09:19.875
Yeah.

09:19.895 --> 09:21.057
What fine did he die of?

09:21.097 --> 09:24.502
This is why we carry two tape recorders.

09:26.886 --> 09:27.486
Okay, I'm sorry.

09:27.507 --> 09:30.912
We were in Chicago and you were getting a book a week?

09:30.932 --> 09:31.272
Yeah.

09:31.713 --> 09:36.400
And you would discuss your reading with Mr. Solly, S-O-L-L-Y, and you were saying you were

09:36.920 --> 09:44.952
Twelve to sixteen years old while you were there, and I was asking you about the kinds of books that you read.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.175
Yeah, and I would read exploration books.

09:48.237 --> 09:57.070
One thing, books on New Guinea, or books on Tibet, or things like that.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.232
Well, then, all kinds of things.

09:58.312 --> 10:05.463
And he gave me, when I graduated, a volume of Matthew Arnold's poetry.

10:05.583 --> 10:06.184
I remember that.

10:06.316 --> 10:13.362
But I was reading a lot, and I also, uh, interested in, well, reading all kinds of things.

10:15.244 --> 10:22.891
And, uh, because I didn't get very much out of my Hyde Park High School, which is a public high school, which was in probably not very good shape then.

10:22.951 --> 10:25.013
Teachers weren't being paid very well, you know.

10:26.134 --> 10:34.922
And I, um, I have no reading memory of anything about Chicago High School, except that I was, didn't like it.

10:37.484 --> 10:42.110
Did you keep any of these books?

10:42.531 --> 10:50.642
I read in some piece about your research on articles, you really don't have an antiquarian bent to you.

10:50.662 --> 10:55.289
I mean, you don't have any sense of the book as an object to be revered as an artifact.

10:55.329 --> 10:56.250
No, no.

10:56.731 --> 10:59.515
So you really didn't take any of these books with you, I guess.

10:59.815 --> 11:00.796
No, no.

11:00.917 --> 11:05.483
No, all those books of my childhood, no.

11:06.273 --> 11:19.067
There are little titles that I remember reading, and that—books that meant something to me, but they're nobody's books anybody ever heard of.

11:20.148 --> 11:31.420
I was reading, you know, the kinds of books that you would read with a flashlight under the blanket sort of thing.

11:32.007 --> 11:36.252
I remember when reading Ulysses, or trying to read it.

11:36.272 --> 11:36.993
Come on.

11:37.013 --> 11:38.275
Yeah.

11:38.295 --> 11:40.497
My uncle had brought it back, a copy of it.

11:40.517 --> 11:42.760
I think this was right around the time of its publication.

11:42.780 --> 11:45.684
Yes, from Paris, before it was published in this country.

11:45.744 --> 11:48.467
1922 in Paris, 1934 here.

11:48.587 --> 11:51.371
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:51.391 --> 11:52.732
But there were other books.

11:52.772 --> 11:55.496
I was reading James Gibbons' Hunneker.

11:55.536 --> 12:00.782
I suppose he was one of the most important guys for me, who was a very

12:01.522 --> 12:21.673
a bombastic critic who wrote, was a friend and guide of Mencken, and wrote about the fantasy-like writers, and he was a kind of Bohemian and bon vivant, and wrote collections like Ivory Apes and Peacocks and things like that.

12:22.554 --> 12:25.639
You wrote a novel called Painted Bails, did you ever see?

12:25.659 --> 12:26.180
I haven't read it.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.744
That got into the modern library.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.952
But he was important for me as a guide.

12:30.992 --> 12:33.475
I have his books.

12:37.338 --> 12:37.679
Oh, well.

12:39.380 --> 12:51.793
I really don't know how much time we have, so I want to kind of cut to it also in terms of this whole concept of the Library of America, which you are one of the co-founders and guiding spirits of.

12:51.813 --> 12:57.178
And I guess Edmund Wilson has played a very prominent

12:57.496 --> 13:01.985
You know, I gave a talk on Edwin Wilson.

13:02.365 --> 13:02.746
At Clark.

13:02.986 --> 13:04.028
I was traveling.

13:04.109 --> 13:05.852
I couldn't make it.

13:06.754 --> 13:07.595
I wish you'd been there.

13:08.838 --> 13:15.811
I was giving a lecture myself at Ohio State University that day.

13:16.352 --> 13:19.538
I couldn't cancel it, of course, but I really wanted to.

13:19.990 --> 13:21.412
Well, it was fun, in a way.

13:21.472 --> 13:24.595
I'm a past president of that board.

13:24.695 --> 13:25.236
Oh, were you?

13:25.956 --> 13:31.583
The president got his library clerk, so I knew all about it and really wanted to be there.

13:31.903 --> 13:33.825
I just had another commitment that day.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.086
It was too bad.

13:35.106 --> 13:47.820
Well, he, of course, is a—I write about him, and I've written other things about him, and he's a very, very important influence on me and friend.

13:50.483 --> 13:59.537
So I think of him along with Honecker, Mencken, as writers.

14:02.902 --> 14:09.572
Perhaps you could just tell me a little bit about why he felt that the establishment of the Library of America.

14:09.732 --> 14:18.786
Well, you know, he had always been interested in, when he was writing, doing his book, Patriotic Gore,

14:19.762 --> 14:28.832
He was having problems getting copies of the books that he wanted to, to writers that he wanted to review, and found out they're just out of print.

14:29.653 --> 14:41.346
So in Tauketville, his house in western New York, near Utica, he had this house where he had this collection of Americana.

14:42.927 --> 14:48.233
The Wellfleet house was usually French, Italian, Latin, you know, Greek, things like that.

14:48.770 --> 14:51.613
But this is America and the old Stonehouse.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.436
And we used to talk about it.

14:54.456 --> 14:58.841
I had a kind of interest in antiquarian feeling about certain writers and books.

14:59.802 --> 15:02.745
And so we were always, in a sense, testing each other.

15:02.805 --> 15:03.726
Have you read this?

15:03.746 --> 15:04.948
I suppose you've read this.

15:05.068 --> 15:05.629
No, you haven't.

15:06.149 --> 15:06.990
You know, that kind of thing.

15:07.891 --> 15:11.175
And so he had this idea.

15:11.195 --> 15:18.743
He talked about this around 1960, of doing a kind of

15:19.516 --> 15:29.770
democratic playard to do, to publish the American books in cheap copy editions.

15:30.151 --> 15:31.032
Inexpensive.

15:31.052 --> 15:32.754
Inexpensive, very inexpensive.

15:32.774 --> 15:34.196
Those books are anything but cheap.

15:34.216 --> 15:34.777
Exactly.

15:34.817 --> 15:35.458
They're beautiful.

15:35.478 --> 15:36.099
They're beautiful.

15:36.119 --> 15:37.421
I have every one, by the way.

15:37.441 --> 15:38.402
Have you?

15:38.422 --> 15:38.663
No, no.

15:38.683 --> 15:42.748
This is the, these were, his idea was that he didn't care about that.

15:42.768 --> 15:47.515
The thing was to have them compact and the same shape size.

15:48.035 --> 15:48.856
cheap paper.

15:50.137 --> 15:51.238
He wasn't concerned about it.

15:51.919 --> 15:55.022
He knew he couldn't do, say, a reel, the equivalent of the playa.

15:56.163 --> 16:01.488
And so that was his plan, and he was trying to get it financed.

16:02.549 --> 16:11.418
And he wanted me to come in and, you know, work with him on this, and to do, edit some of the, right, he'd got introductions.

16:11.658 --> 16:15.662
He wanted little introductions, and I would do some of those.

16:15.828 --> 16:24.398
and do eventually sets of William Gilmore Simms or something of that kind, you know, writers that are lost sighted, forgotten.

16:24.938 --> 16:29.624
James Brant's Cabal of Keppel.

16:29.644 --> 16:29.804
Exactly.

16:29.884 --> 16:32.267
He had a special feeling for Keppel.

16:33.628 --> 16:34.289
Yeah, he did.

16:34.309 --> 16:34.850
He liked him.

16:35.651 --> 16:44.721
But there were other writers that he was discovering, you know, that figured in patriotic lore.

16:46.118 --> 16:48.440
Well, that fell through.

16:48.500 --> 16:55.507
He couldn't get the money to do it, and a lot of other people or publishers were against it and everything else.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.168
Why were they against it, these things?

16:57.208 --> 17:02.253
Well, I mean, a lot of them— Fine.

17:03.595 --> 17:05.176
He antagonized people.

17:05.196 --> 17:14.725
So it was more Wilson than the other— Well, I think he could have probably ingratiated himself if he had been less brusque.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.042
And you did have that side to him, didn't you?

17:17.062 --> 17:18.103
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

17:19.265 --> 17:19.585
Yes.

17:20.466 --> 17:22.549
I'm multitasking, is that the thing you meant?

17:22.909 --> 17:23.750
Yeah.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.813
Go ahead, I'm reflecting on that.

17:25.993 --> 17:36.105
Well, and that's—this is what—and he was very rough with people he disagreed with.

17:36.727 --> 17:42.813
And I think that the publishers were not in favor of it.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.135
They didn't want this kind of thing.

17:45.175 --> 17:57.626
Or they were interested in getting scholarly editions with long introductions and these kind of, I've forgotten the name of the series now.

17:58.127 --> 18:00.629
They published some of these books, these scholarly editions.

18:00.669 --> 18:01.770
Nobody ever read them.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.152
Doorstoppers, big clumsy books.

18:04.773 --> 18:06.435
But there's something paradoxical here.

18:06.515 --> 18:22.377
If we talk on the one hand of restoring to print the cornerstones of the American canon on the one hand, and yet they're out of print and nobody's reading them, how can something be canonical on the one hand and not be... He never thought of them as canonical.

18:23.158 --> 18:24.419
That's another thing.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.084
He wouldn't have used the word canon.

18:28.164 --> 18:28.785
He wouldn't have.

18:28.805 --> 18:28.986
No.

18:29.326 --> 18:32.350
He wanted to get what Americans had written

18:32.785 --> 18:43.357
forgotten Americans, writers who nobody ever heard of, but who were writing at a time and were saying interesting things that would be part of the American experience.

18:43.377 --> 18:49.424
So he wanted the Forgotten, but the Library of America started with Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Emerson.

18:49.624 --> 18:50.786
Yes, of course.

18:50.806 --> 18:54.290
So it really did start with the candidate.

18:54.470 --> 18:54.810
It did.

18:56.733 --> 19:01.358
It had to, because we wouldn't have been able to get it funded.

19:02.637 --> 19:12.012
And so he was dead, of course, before our first volume came out.

19:13.635 --> 19:23.631
He would have liked it simply because these were well-made books, and they were well put together, and they were very well edited, you know, the kind of things that he would have been proud of.

19:24.172 --> 19:27.818
But that wasn't what he had in mind.

19:28.253 --> 19:38.827
He was not pretty interested in bookmaking or, you know, he just wanted to get books in print and make them available.

19:38.867 --> 19:39.648
Forgotten books.

19:39.668 --> 19:42.432
Yes, forgotten books, but get them back into print.

19:42.452 --> 19:44.715
So who would decide which text?

19:44.775 --> 19:45.676
He would decide.

19:45.696 --> 19:48.600
I mean, there was no— This was not going to be a democratic thing.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.180
No, not at all.

19:49.200 --> 19:58.092
So, now this differs markedly from what you and your colleagues— Oh, absolutely.

19:58.409 --> 20:00.332
Absolutely.

20:00.412 --> 20:00.532
Yeah.

20:00.552 --> 20:05.640
Tell me a bit about your concept, the one that we came in for twenty-eighths, two years or so ago.

20:05.660 --> 20:13.692
The, the, the, uh, there were, of course, books that we published that were, had not been reprinted for a long time.

20:13.752 --> 20:24.028
They were, uh, um, and, uh, they were in, uh, uh, sometimes, well,

20:25.932 --> 20:27.694
They were hard to get at, hard to read.

20:27.774 --> 20:38.065
You could still, for example, the main major writers, you could read.

20:38.105 --> 20:44.451
I can't think of any American writer that wasn't, that we did, that was not available in any form.

20:46.914 --> 20:55.062
But there's so much, they were in such bad shape, and badly edited, and full of mistakes,

20:55.548 --> 21:03.158
No effort at all to do the kind of proper editorial work.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.182
That would be tuned.

21:06.202 --> 21:11.268
That, of course, was like the French playade, where those were impeccably done, you see.

21:11.288 --> 21:16.375
So we tried to more or less imitate the playade French playade.

21:16.395 --> 21:17.436
In terms of the editing.

21:17.456 --> 21:25.386
In terms of the editing, and the quality of the paper, and all the rest of it, and the authoritativeness of it.

21:25.568 --> 21:30.094
and he would have wanted this to do, was to do introductions.

21:31.596 --> 21:33.338
I really miss the introduction.

21:33.698 --> 21:39.105
Well, I was responsible, as much as anybody, for not having him.

21:39.125 --> 21:52.943
Because my argument was that they date, so that somebody would be very enthusiastic and make some claims and so forth, and they would show what was in fashion at that moment when this was done,

21:53.480 --> 21:56.767
And there would be the idiosyncrasies, you see.

21:57.389 --> 21:59.193
I thought, no, have the text.

21:59.554 --> 22:01.037
Let people come and read the text.

22:01.077 --> 22:02.480
Give them the information they need.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.665
Give them the chronologies.

22:04.725 --> 22:06.309
The chronologies are wonderful.

22:06.509 --> 22:11.400
And the state of the text and where it comes from.

22:12.302 --> 22:12.703
That's it.

22:13.493 --> 22:14.835
Don't have introductions.

22:15.055 --> 22:15.576
Most introductions.

22:15.596 --> 22:16.737
I haven't thought of that, of course.

22:16.757 --> 22:19.221
I'm reading it from the standpoint of my generation.

22:19.341 --> 22:20.242
Yes, yes.

22:20.442 --> 22:24.888
But I also think in terms, you are trying to create something that will be timeless.

22:24.928 --> 22:25.248
Sure.

22:25.509 --> 22:32.658
And somebody comes to this text 50 or 75 years from now, and they say, well, look at, well, they got this all along, didn't they?

22:32.678 --> 22:33.479
Yeah, that's right.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.822
And they kind of dismiss the text itself.

22:36.043 --> 22:37.985
Yeah.

22:38.085 --> 22:43.112
And some of the writers were, things seemed a little like Mark Twain.

22:43.919 --> 22:52.831
Well, there was a kind of a Mark Twain industry that was beginning, but it was still very academic, and it was very hard to bring this together.

22:52.851 --> 23:06.248
And our texts of Mark Twain, I think, are wonderful, because all that kind of scholarship has been incorporated, but without any of what— The apparatus of the Berkeley stuff.

23:06.268 --> 23:09.152
Well, what I think— What Wilson called barbed wire.

23:09.953 --> 23:10.274
Oh, barbed wire.

23:10.614 --> 23:10.875
Yeah.

23:11.035 --> 23:13.538
His attacks against these scholarly additions.

23:14.480 --> 23:18.225
antagonize the academic profession.

23:18.245 --> 23:19.426
How do you weigh in on that?

23:19.666 --> 23:22.690
Well, the thing is that I've tried to flake it.

23:22.770 --> 23:23.832
I was in both, you see.

23:24.733 --> 23:33.944
And one of the things to do was to win over these editors who were doing the scholarly editions.

23:34.024 --> 23:34.545
The MLA.

23:34.825 --> 23:36.648
Yes, the MLA.

23:36.768 --> 23:40.673
They were the ones that had to be wooed.

23:40.693 --> 23:44.217
And if we were going to get the funding for the

23:44.635 --> 23:48.360
the National Endowment of the Humanities.

23:49.602 --> 23:57.913
And there was, they, this group opposes ferociously, and the whole story has not been told.

23:58.994 --> 24:11.551
I have kept a record of it, and I've just given it now, almost day-to-day, play-by-play account of this, which eventually will be written, which is now, you can't tease me with a little bit of it?

24:11.571 --> 24:13.954
Can you tease me with a little bit of it?

24:13.974 --> 24:14.575
Just about what

24:14.943 --> 24:16.165
How fractious was this?

24:16.245 --> 24:16.646
What was it?

24:16.746 --> 24:18.088
Very, very fractious.

24:18.368 --> 24:21.273
And was it basically protecting turf, or did it— Partly.

24:22.295 --> 24:28.004
They were doing their own additions, and they— On one level, it was petty, on the one hand.

24:28.525 --> 24:29.827
Well, they didn't say it was petty.

24:29.847 --> 24:37.599
They just felt that they were guaranteeing quality and what right—we to come in.

24:37.639 --> 24:39.482
They had invested all this time and money.

24:40.070 --> 24:42.833
And with the professionals, these were the amateurs.

24:42.893 --> 24:44.214
Well, they couldn't say it.

24:44.234 --> 24:44.454
Any of you?

24:44.634 --> 24:45.395
Yeah, sort of.

24:45.896 --> 24:47.938
But the thing is, they never got these different books out.

24:48.478 --> 24:52.142
They would take them two or three years before one of the volumes would come out.

24:52.642 --> 24:57.006
They had committees and everything, and then these great, big, huge, bulky volumes, which nobody would read.

24:57.066 --> 25:00.209
Amazing.

25:01.290 --> 25:02.732
And they gradually saw it.

25:02.752 --> 25:09.418
I mean, the whole story of Wilson on the MLA has been—he's written essays on this, you know.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.544
But any of that.

25:14.166 --> 25:21.999
So, if you could talk generally about how something is recognized as being canonical.

25:23.661 --> 25:27.327
We say that this is the American literary canon.

25:27.367 --> 25:33.297
Okay, and I guess now that if it makes it to the Library of America, it does have that kind of authority.

25:33.530 --> 25:41.299
Yes, I mean, although that is gradually dissipating because we're published through so many books that are not technically in the canon.

25:42.020 --> 25:48.807
I mean, if you do detective stories, if you do baseball, if you do, well, that's not, those, by the way, those books aren't in our series.

25:49.108 --> 25:50.970
They're not in a separate series.

25:50.990 --> 25:51.891
They're separate, that's right.

25:51.911 --> 26:01.562
But we have published books in the series that would, well, for example, would people put

26:02.555 --> 26:05.119
Uh, Steinbeck in the canon?

26:05.880 --> 26:07.242
I love Steinbeck.

26:07.322 --> 26:08.023
Yeah, well, yeah.

26:08.244 --> 26:10.007
But you see people, different things.

26:10.047 --> 26:13.512
The, uh, uh... What is the canon?

26:13.532 --> 26:15.255
I mean... Well, what is the canon indeed?

26:15.755 --> 26:18.219
You know, like the guy who's been around for six or seven decades.

26:18.460 --> 26:18.740
Yeah.

26:19.501 --> 26:23.247
And people are reading him appreciatively, uh, so...

26:23.615 --> 26:24.656
What are we talking about?

26:24.676 --> 26:33.908
Yes, it's a very hard concept, really, to work out, and it's conferred by a group of people who decide they're going to be the ones to determine.

26:34.289 --> 26:38.234
Your colleague Helen, right next floor, I asked her this very same question.

26:38.334 --> 26:41.317
I said, how does someone become canonical?

26:41.818 --> 26:43.020
And she said, other writers.

26:43.841 --> 26:44.722
And that's right.

26:44.742 --> 26:45.463
Yes, I think that's the answer.

26:45.483 --> 26:50.509
The approbation of other writers over a period of time, and it's hard to dispute that.

26:50.529 --> 26:52.812
Yes, I think she's right.

26:53.500 --> 27:00.551
Can you more or less give a sense of the arc of your own reading over your lifetime?

27:00.571 --> 27:04.016
Has it followed an arc, or has it been...?

27:04.036 --> 27:10.125
I certainly would say that my reading has not been shaped by the canon.

27:11.227 --> 27:12.889
I just read everything under the sun.

27:13.571 --> 27:16.054
We read trash, you know.

27:16.094 --> 27:16.876
That was part of it.

27:17.717 --> 27:21.242
Did you ever see this little book, American Notes, that I did?

27:21.523 --> 27:21.803
Yes.

27:22.272 --> 27:29.019
That little introduction there about my reading, that has a lot of I got.

27:29.039 --> 27:31.602
A few years ago, I guess.

27:31.622 --> 27:32.323
Yeah.

27:32.343 --> 27:39.230
Yeah, that has a lot in it about me and my work.

27:45.477 --> 27:48.280
So you say it really is an eclectic kind of

27:51.398 --> 27:57.728
Well, of course, I think as you get older you hear about writers and things.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.773
I, you, and you go, you have spells.

28:00.854 --> 28:07.705
For example, I find now more and more that I'm not reading contemporary writers.

28:08.306 --> 28:08.967
I don't follow them.

28:08.987 --> 28:11.832
I do, every so often I do, when it's very much in the news.

28:12.252 --> 28:14.436
Say Philip Roth's new book or something of that kind.

28:14.990 --> 28:24.481
But I've been spending this last year re-reading, but in a kind of a different way and much more carefully, Proust.

28:24.982 --> 28:26.043
You're not an American, right?

28:26.063 --> 28:26.663
No, no.

28:26.984 --> 28:29.226
And there are not many, no.

28:29.667 --> 28:33.111
So you go back, so continue, you're re-reading Proust.

28:33.171 --> 28:33.872
Yes, yes.

28:34.152 --> 28:35.714
And I read very slowly.

28:35.774 --> 28:37.456
Satisfaction, might I ask?

28:38.557 --> 28:39.779
I think he's the greatest writer.

28:40.059 --> 28:43.142
Now, are you reading him in Moncrief or are you reading him in French?

28:43.543 --> 28:44.524
I'm reading in Moncrief.

28:44.825 --> 28:45.366
I couldn't.

28:45.426 --> 28:48.490
My French is— So, Proust's mockery for you is Proust.

28:48.590 --> 28:49.031
That's right.

28:49.591 --> 28:52.355
Interesting concept, too, isn't it?

28:52.395 --> 28:52.956
It is.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.681
Alas, I have to say, because—but I knew that I wouldn't be able to read it.

28:57.362 --> 29:08.757
I couldn't read—I mean, just the vocabulary, the—there's so many different vocabularies in remembrance of things past—scientific,

29:09.580 --> 29:14.205
See, just by calling it Remembrance of Things Past makes it an English book, doesn't it?

29:14.225 --> 29:16.468
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right.

29:17.129 --> 29:20.272
So does the translation become a new work of art in its own way?

29:20.292 --> 29:27.460
Yes, I think so, because I know now that the translation is only one man's impression.

29:27.921 --> 29:38.473
But to me, I think I understand Proust now in a way that I—you read

29:39.314 --> 29:47.162
for a year, ten pages a night less, and read, and read, and read, and read, and read it in a certain way.

29:48.723 --> 29:50.365
I've never read a book like this.

29:50.385 --> 29:52.366
It took my wife a year and a half to read books.

29:52.387 --> 29:52.727
Really?

29:54.188 --> 29:57.491
But with great satisfaction, she enjoyed it, she savored it.

29:57.591 --> 30:01.235
And she really doesn't, she likes nonfiction.

30:01.275 --> 30:03.177
So therefore she wouldn't qualify, by the way.

30:03.257 --> 30:06.520
You know this NEA report that says reading is in decline?

30:07.040 --> 30:10.464
You saw this report a couple of weeks ago.

30:10.484 --> 30:12.927
But that's only if you read fiction, you know.

30:13.667 --> 30:26.021
Like my wife who reads biography and reads the kind of material that you write, she wouldn't matter because she's not reading Daniel Steele, for instance.

30:26.161 --> 30:36.793
I think what I find that taking most of my time now, and I am a little alarmed by that because I read the TLS.

30:38.157 --> 30:38.758
every week.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.861
I read the London Review of Books.

30:41.762 --> 30:43.745
I read the New York Review of Books.

30:45.287 --> 30:49.513
Just, I read the Los Angeles Times book page.

30:50.635 --> 30:54.400
Just, I don't read the New Republic anymore, although I used to write for it.

30:56.523 --> 30:59.487
Just reading those books takes quite a bit of time, you know.

30:59.507 --> 30:59.968
I don't read.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.114
And then there's certain

31:04.955 --> 31:28.067
articles written, scholarly articles written by friends of mine, and that are calling attention to, oh, is this a new essay, a collection of D. H. Florence and the big edition on the studies of classic American literature and the whole history of that.

31:28.788 --> 31:31.992
It was fascinating, one long article.

31:32.326 --> 31:34.349
things that come in and interrupt.

31:34.970 --> 31:38.835
And I don't think I read systematically now.

31:38.856 --> 31:42.260
Do you have a pile?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.283
I have piles of things, yeah.

31:44.303 --> 31:47.909
Do you read a lot of things simultaneously?

31:47.929 --> 31:48.029
Yeah.

31:48.049 --> 31:49.431
That's the way I like to read.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.613
Yeah, I was there.

31:50.633 --> 31:51.754
Or if something put it down.

31:51.774 --> 31:52.596
Yeah, that's right.

31:52.616 --> 31:57.583
If I travel for three days, I take four books and I'm nuts.

31:57.603 --> 31:57.743
Yeah.

31:58.178 --> 32:01.242
put one down and you pick the other one up.

32:01.262 --> 32:02.443
And I write that way.

32:02.503 --> 32:09.512
I have all my chakras moving simultaneously, like a phalanx, you know, and I go from this one to that one and go back to that.

32:09.532 --> 32:14.919
And the idea is that they all end at the same time, you know, that you reach that point.

32:15.279 --> 32:17.262
And you write with a computer.

32:17.322 --> 32:19.004
Yeah, how about yourself?

32:19.024 --> 32:20.546
Yeah, I don't, and that's the thing.

32:20.566 --> 32:24.070
I should have done it ten years ago, and it may have made a big difference, but I can't.

32:24.691 --> 32:25.452
I have to write

32:26.613 --> 32:28.275
with pencil and paper at first.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.037
I like the feeling of it.

32:30.077 --> 32:31.098
I like the sentences.

32:31.678 --> 32:33.480
There's the tactility to it.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.703
Yes, and there's the notion of seeing just something come out.

32:38.045 --> 32:43.310
Even sometimes after I've typed something, I will rewrite it in pencil.

32:43.650 --> 32:49.176
That's wonderful.

32:49.216 --> 32:51.979
You know, you talk about going back to choosing to reread

32:52.432 --> 33:01.140
So perhaps, I asked Harold Bloom this question, my sister laughed, and I said, is there anything you've ever wanted to read that you haven't read that remains unwritten?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.921
He said, my, what an interesting question.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.323
He said, nobody's ever asked that.

33:04.343 --> 33:07.205
I mean, I can think of thousands of books that I'll probably never get to read.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.647
He claims to have read everything he's ever thought.

33:11.449 --> 33:17.434
I suppose he does come close to it in some ways, but there's a great deal of it.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.717
But the next point was, he said, it's choosing what to reread.

33:21.001 --> 33:22.002
That's interesting.

33:22.022 --> 33:24.305
And you've kind of just touched on that.

33:24.365 --> 33:29.931
So thinking, you know, here you are, you're in your 90s now.

33:29.951 --> 33:33.775
Is that a big decision, choosing what to go back and to read this?

33:33.895 --> 33:34.435
I think so.

33:35.717 --> 33:42.684
And I think it's so wonderful for Foust, you see, because it's going into, it's diving into an ocean.

33:43.325 --> 33:50.873
And this is, there's so many things that occur to me as I read this.

33:51.848 --> 33:53.651
I'm trying to think of who will I do after that.

33:54.432 --> 33:59.400
One writer that I read that way for a period, some years ago, was Robert Musel.

34:00.541 --> 34:02.845
He's a man without qualities, you know.

34:03.927 --> 34:04.387
Quite a book.

34:04.648 --> 34:05.028
Yeah.

34:05.048 --> 34:06.691
Quite an unknown book.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.034
Remarkably, I think.

34:09.054 --> 34:09.295
Yeah.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.438
To me, it's a wonderful book.

34:11.779 --> 34:12.259
Yeah.

34:12.279 --> 34:12.680
I haven't.

34:12.740 --> 34:13.601
I haven't done it.

34:13.621 --> 34:14.082
Uh-huh.

34:14.102 --> 34:14.323
Yeah.

34:14.463 --> 34:14.823
Sorry.

34:14.843 --> 34:15.024
Go ahead.

34:15.404 --> 34:15.504
Yeah.

34:15.765 --> 34:15.985
Well.

34:18.108 --> 34:20.312
Did you enjoy it?

34:20.372 --> 34:20.472
Yeah.

34:20.907 --> 34:30.121
See, I keep journals, and I keep excerpts, and I copy things.

34:30.141 --> 34:37.111
Yeah, and my journals are full of, when I was reading extracts from Mosul.

34:39.915 --> 34:49.429
Earlier, I started out when I was 16, 17, and I was reading Huisemont's.

34:51.502 --> 34:58.812
large extracts of sort of heavy, fantasiac stuff.

34:58.832 --> 35:08.225
Bombastic, romantic, uh, solipsistic, you know, just looking back at myself in those days.

35:08.245 --> 35:19.180
Um, the, um, my teacher, who I would allot to at Ann Arbor, named Eric Walter,

35:20.003 --> 35:24.550
who first introduced me to James, Virginia Woolf.

35:26.212 --> 35:31.840
But when I was a freshman, he said, uh, Aaron, you're word drunk.

35:34.064 --> 35:35.286
I'd try everything, you see.

35:35.967 --> 35:45.260
So it was terrible stuff, but I'd try and, every time I'd look at a word, I'd, uh, I'd want to use it and find ways of doing it.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.525
So that it was the most, the art was ridiculous.

35:49.670 --> 35:51.612
writing you could possibly imagine.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.902
But I still am interested in words.

35:59.823 --> 36:02.527
So these journals, these were reading journals?

36:03.187 --> 36:03.788
Reading journals.

36:03.808 --> 36:05.010
And then you kept them over all these?

36:05.030 --> 36:05.330
Yes.

36:05.871 --> 36:06.732
So those you kept.

36:06.772 --> 36:08.554
You haven't kept the books, but you kept the journals.

36:08.574 --> 36:09.495
I kept the journals.

36:09.515 --> 36:10.437
Did you go into the journals?

36:10.657 --> 36:11.138
Here it is?

36:11.158 --> 36:11.518
Yeah.

36:11.718 --> 36:13.120
For this book, I did.

36:13.140 --> 36:14.161
I used it a lot.

36:14.181 --> 36:18.487
And so you see perceptions as you had several decades ago.

36:18.507 --> 36:18.767
More.

36:19.068 --> 36:19.288
More.

36:19.741 --> 36:29.455
Sometimes I'm ashamed of them, but I had to say to myself, no, everything that you did was you, because you felt this way at the time.

36:30.217 --> 36:39.530
So you can't go against yourself when you show all your ridiculousness and posture and all that kind of thing.

36:39.550 --> 36:39.711
No.

36:40.712 --> 36:41.593
That's part of them.

36:41.613 --> 36:46.761
Did you feel that when you were doing these journals that you were writing them for yourself or for another reader?

36:47.011 --> 36:56.245
Well, you know, I always had a feeling at the time, as any young writer, who knows, eventually, posterity may discover these things, you see.

36:57.047 --> 36:59.691
You're talking to the man who did the Inman Diary.

36:59.711 --> 37:00.973
Yes, quick.

37:01.093 --> 37:01.994
This is, yes.

37:03.396 --> 37:15.415
But, gradually, it became much, very soon, I'm very glad to say, it became less a diary than a commonplace book.

37:16.002 --> 37:22.972
It's my recordings, my reading, my quotations, all kinds of things that I have.

37:23.253 --> 37:26.217
And some of them I find terribly entertaining and amusing.

37:28.080 --> 37:41.219
And I've kept a big one now that I use, and it's a ... That's one of them right there, huh?

37:41.239 --> 37:45.385
Journals of trips abroad in China, a place of this kind.

37:45.803 --> 37:58.523
Here's a man who made a big impression on me, and I read everything I can.

38:00.085 --> 38:00.706
Lichtenberg.

38:00.806 --> 38:02.830
Did you ever read Lichtenberg's Aphorisms?

38:03.070 --> 38:03.691
No, I haven't.

38:03.891 --> 38:04.292
Oh, well.

38:05.273 --> 38:05.975
He's wonderful.

38:08.659 --> 38:11.423
And this is one of your ... This is ...

38:18.355 --> 38:25.702
This is young me when I was starting out.

38:25.722 --> 38:25.922
Wow.

38:29.045 --> 38:34.190
There was quite a nice piece of Mark Feeney, you wrote a couple of years back.

38:34.430 --> 38:35.971
Yeah.

38:35.991 --> 38:45.280
I had no idea that you had crossed paths with so many extraordinary people over your lifetime in Korea.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.282
Well, I don't write about that as much as

38:47.448 --> 38:49.851
A lot of people think I should have.

38:50.011 --> 38:51.053
JFK was your student.

38:51.073 --> 38:52.995
Betty Friedan was your student.

38:53.215 --> 38:58.702
She acknowledged you in that Feminine Mystique book that she did, apparently.

38:58.762 --> 38:59.263
Who?

38:59.283 --> 39:00.104
Betty Friedan.

39:00.124 --> 39:00.845
Really?

39:01.025 --> 39:01.826
From Smith.

39:02.127 --> 39:03.048
Yeah, I remember that.

39:03.268 --> 39:11.058
She apparently acknowledged your contribution to her development of this Feminine Mystique, so don't forget that.

39:11.819 --> 39:15.784
When you talk about really touching people as a

39:17.401 --> 39:26.371
I keep aphorisms, I think, that are terribly important to me.

39:26.571 --> 39:31.457
So this book that you're holding right here— This is, to me, a fascinating book.

39:32.958 --> 39:36.522
I love it, because it's—yes, I read it with great interest.

39:37.103 --> 39:37.964
That's your book, right?

39:37.984 --> 39:38.584
This is my book.

39:38.665 --> 39:40.927
I want to just take a picture of you looking at it, if I like.

39:41.488 --> 39:41.788
Do I?

39:46.747 --> 39:54.616
This is the kind of thing that I do, which is sort of, see, I thought of names for hurricanes.

39:54.917 --> 39:59.442
Why not have terrible names for hurricanes instead of the Betty, Susie?

39:59.462 --> 40:00.423
They really have to give up.

40:00.443 --> 40:01.605
They're frightful things.

40:01.645 --> 40:02.266
Why should we?

40:02.326 --> 40:03.107
Yes.

40:03.207 --> 40:05.069
So here are my name stories.

40:05.089 --> 40:07.372
Do you want me to take a picture?

40:07.392 --> 40:09.775
Go ahead.

40:09.795 --> 40:11.336
For hurricanes.

40:12.057 --> 40:14.340
I can even see the pictures that I'm taking.

40:15.451 --> 40:17.353
I never thought I'd go digital, but here we are.

40:19.575 --> 40:21.577
So what are some of the names that you have there?

40:21.597 --> 40:43.737
Attila, Ahab, Elis, Beelzebub, Caesar, Demogorgon, Erebus, Fafner, Goliath, Hannibal, Iago, Jupiter, Khomeini, Loki, Mussolini, McCarthy, Macedon, Medusa, Milosevic, Napoleon, Nebuchadnezzar, Odin, Pol Pot, Polyphemus, Pizarro,

40:44.273 --> 41:04.933
Pinochet, Gaddafi, Quasimodo, Quilp, Ragnarok, Rossier, Reagan, Ronald, Sherman, Stalin, Salon, Saloni, Shiva, Thor, Ukuleina, Villa, Van Malki, Votran, Vulcan, Wotan, Xanthippe, Xerxes, Ymir.

41:06.155 --> 41:07.996
First of all, the giants of chaos.

41:08.016 --> 41:13.622
I've got a Z. Oh, you'll have to get a Z.

41:15.290 --> 41:19.715
Are you familiar with the Pricking in the Mind of Man exhibition in London in 1963?

41:20.096 --> 41:20.456
Yeah.

41:21.397 --> 41:23.760
Very famous.

41:23.780 --> 41:26.623
They picked 440 books.

41:26.663 --> 41:30.848
If they didn't change the world, at least they occasioned things.

41:30.888 --> 41:33.071
They made things happen.

41:33.251 --> 41:38.597
Of course, the obvious ones like Copernicus and Isaac Newton and Darwin and Freud.

41:39.067 --> 41:43.774
There's very little fiction in there, and yet, you know, Pilgrim's Progress is in there.

41:43.894 --> 41:46.297
It's just one of my favorite books.

41:46.898 --> 41:48.340
Such an influential book.

41:49.362 --> 41:52.526
The Utopia, of course, is a work of fiction.

41:52.567 --> 42:01.379
The Arnold Tom's cabin, Lincoln, you know, might be apocryphal, but he says, so this is the little woman who created this.

42:01.399 --> 42:02.801
If it didn't happen, it should have happened.

42:02.821 --> 42:03.562
Yes, that's right.

42:04.584 --> 42:08.770
Do you think that it is possible for

42:09.239 --> 42:15.327
literature to, if not change the world, but to make things happen?

42:15.347 --> 42:17.570
I don't think literature ever changes the world.

42:18.031 --> 42:20.153
I think that it can give the world a nudge.

42:23.498 --> 42:23.738
I like that.

42:23.758 --> 42:24.539
And you think still?

42:25.040 --> 42:25.420
Yes.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.904
Even people are going to these things now for their .

42:27.924 --> 42:27.944
.

42:27.964 --> 42:28.104
.

42:28.124 --> 42:34.673
Yes, it's harder now because there's so much noise going on and there's so many influence things that are coming from all directions.

42:34.693 --> 42:36.094
So it's hard to think of a book.

42:36.895 --> 42:38.858
You have to have the right occasion.

42:39.310 --> 42:42.394
Even something like The Grapes of Wrath came at a certain time, you know.

42:43.675 --> 42:51.684
But many books that are always called the Uncle Tom's Cabin of this, books that change people's minds, that kind of thing.

42:52.726 --> 42:54.688
Were they too simplistic, do you think?

42:54.708 --> 42:56.690
Of course, it's bound to be simplistic.

42:56.730 --> 43:02.958
I mean, many of the things that were, you know, regarded as one's books of that kind are now forgotten.

43:04.099 --> 43:07.663
Can you think of any of them?

43:12.301 --> 43:13.443
Progress and Poverty.

43:14.344 --> 43:16.607
I didn't know it.

43:16.628 --> 43:22.957
Progress and Poverty was written by a single-tax man.

43:25.801 --> 43:26.763
Jesus.

43:27.003 --> 43:28.586
What is it, Progress and Poverty?

43:28.606 --> 43:30.048
Progress and Poverty.

43:30.068 --> 43:30.889
Poverty.

43:31.410 --> 43:33.533
Oh, Christ.

43:33.800 --> 43:37.665
I think it's great that you can't... Oh, no.

43:37.725 --> 43:41.710
My mind now is... It shows how it's kind of fallen into a... No, no, no, no.

43:41.730 --> 43:42.931
It has nothing to do with that.

43:43.492 --> 43:48.759
It's simply that my mind is... I can't remember my best friend's name.

43:49.139 --> 43:49.339
Oh.

43:50.040 --> 43:50.341
Yeah.

43:50.361 --> 43:51.222
I mean, it's something like that.

43:51.282 --> 43:52.583
You have a legendary memory.

43:52.623 --> 43:59.292
Well, I have a... This is what's happening.

43:59.512 --> 44:00.313
Henry George.

44:01.289 --> 44:03.352
Do you never read of Progress and Poverty?

44:03.813 --> 44:04.534
I'm embarrassed, no.

44:04.954 --> 44:07.337
Well, what, what, what, what, the Proximity, what is it he wrote?

44:07.958 --> 44:10.221
Well, he wrote this in, in the 1870s.

44:10.241 --> 44:10.902
1870s.

44:11.003 --> 44:15.949
He, he was, he, he was the, the theory of the single tax.

44:16.530 --> 44:24.081
There was a notion that if you had one single tax, and it was on land, and under, on an increment, you could pay for everything.

44:24.201 --> 44:28.647
It was a kind of a, a, a kind of utopian idea.

44:28.745 --> 44:32.349
But everybody knew about him and wrote about him.

44:34.352 --> 44:42.521
There's a wonderful essay by George Bernard Shaw, first hearing Henry George speak in London.

44:43.642 --> 44:57.098
And Edward Bellamy, of course, well, he and George were contemporaries.

44:57.247 --> 45:04.075
Oh, by the way, I think that Proverbs and Properties is an extraordinary book as a piece of writing.

45:04.715 --> 45:05.796
Yeah.

45:05.816 --> 45:06.457
I'll go check it out.

45:07.518 --> 45:10.662
I have an essay in this book, Men of Good Hope.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.384
Men of Good Hope.

45:12.404 --> 45:13.805
That's my first book.

45:17.069 --> 45:19.451
I have access to all your books, by the way.

45:19.471 --> 45:26.359
Yeah, well, this is a... I used to come in here and do a lot of reading at Widener, which is great.

45:26.677 --> 45:27.838
But it's still a trip in.

45:27.858 --> 45:31.362
But they've given me full privileges of Holy Cross and Clark.

45:31.423 --> 45:38.411
So between the two of them, I get pretty much everything I'm looking for, maybe 98%.

45:38.971 --> 45:39.492
I'm sure.

45:39.592 --> 45:44.198
If you're looking for some kind of special thing, but no.

45:45.699 --> 45:50.625
All right, we'd go to the Athenaeum, which is the best $200.

45:51.213 --> 45:52.975
It's up to $200,000.

45:53.235 --> 45:54.297
Is it cost it now?

45:54.317 --> 45:55.458
$100.

45:55.798 --> 45:58.281
I used to go there.

45:58.341 --> 46:00.804
I had a privilege to be given the right to look at it.

46:01.485 --> 46:02.226
I used to go there.

46:02.486 --> 46:03.968
That's a wonderful place to read.

46:04.048 --> 46:04.849
It really is.

46:05.029 --> 46:09.694
I think one of the great reading rooms anywhere.

46:10.215 --> 46:12.658
So we're talking again about what you say.

46:12.698 --> 46:18.344
You think that books can give history a nudge, if not certainly change it outright.

46:18.364 --> 46:20.967
Do you think this is...

46:21.824 --> 46:24.768
You've seen any examples of this over the last thirty or forty years?

46:25.269 --> 46:27.011
I wonder why To Kill a Mockingbird.

46:27.091 --> 46:30.095
There's a book that even became a great film.

46:30.396 --> 46:31.117
Yes.

46:31.137 --> 46:31.938
And look at that book.

46:32.398 --> 46:42.392
Now, I wonder if you just took a freshman class coming to Harvard, who would presumably read a little bit more than most kids do.

46:42.412 --> 46:44.575
They don't, really, I don't think.

46:44.835 --> 46:45.216
I wonder.

46:45.236 --> 46:50.683
I don't think there would be.

46:51.372 --> 47:01.621
And even much greater writers, in my opinion, that were tremendously important to me, but nobody reads.

47:01.641 --> 47:02.322
Santayana.

47:04.123 --> 47:11.830
There are a whole series of books—I wrote a piece on this once—by famous writers who try novels, but they're not novelists.

47:13.031 --> 47:19.877
But they write interesting books that aren't novels, like Santayana's novel The Last Puritan.

47:20.313 --> 47:27.682
or Lionel Trilling's The Middle of the Journey, or some other books.

47:27.802 --> 47:31.987
They're extremely interesting as works of great writers and minds.

47:32.407 --> 47:34.550
But they're not fiction.

47:34.570 --> 47:36.432
They're something else.

47:39.375 --> 47:44.922
Well, is there something missing in your view?

47:44.942 --> 47:46.023
Well, they're just not writers.

47:46.544 --> 47:47.805
They're not novelists.

47:48.595 --> 47:51.719
And everybody, you can be a good writer and not necessarily write novels.

47:52.500 --> 47:58.649
And interesting books are written that are technically novels, by non-novelists.

48:00.311 --> 48:00.892
That happens.

48:01.533 --> 48:06.900
Can you articulate what a great novel requires for you to perceive its themes?

48:07.861 --> 48:11.386
Well, it's hard to do.

48:12.067 --> 48:17.995
And I wouldn't, I'd have to go back and stop looking and see what did I say then.

48:18.194 --> 48:31.467
I just have this feeling that, say, to me, Anna Karenina is a great novel.

48:31.968 --> 48:44.640
Novels that simply come out of life and take on a kind of a life of their own, and they continue to vibrate, you know, and live

48:45.363 --> 48:54.135
They take on a permanence, simply like some kind of organism, and that's what happens.

48:54.976 --> 48:57.299
That's the quote I came here to get, I think.

48:57.319 --> 49:00.384
That quotation that you just gave me is wonderful.

49:00.804 --> 49:03.748
Thank you.

49:03.848 --> 49:08.775
Your colleague, Robert Coles, in all of the courses he teaches at Harvard, it's all fiction.

49:08.895 --> 49:13.682
I mean, he teaches medical students, or business school students,

49:14.422 --> 49:25.037
how to become better physicians or whatever by asking them to read Tulsa or Middlemarch.

49:25.057 --> 49:27.780
I think that's kind of what you're saying in a way.

49:29.242 --> 49:32.527
Yes, I haven't given it much thought.

49:33.688 --> 49:38.455
Any of that.

49:44.510 --> 49:47.394
So, where do you think you'd like to see the library?

49:47.454 --> 49:51.159
When it first arrived, they were talking a hundred books.

49:51.760 --> 50:00.932
Thankfully, they've gone beyond that in terms of... Yes, it's become, because it's not... It's this word, classics, you see.

50:01.473 --> 50:03.976
The Library of the Math doesn't have classics in the title.

50:05.959 --> 50:09.804
Although the founding entity was literary classics.

50:09.884 --> 50:10.365
It was.

50:11.527 --> 50:29.552
But I think it is, this has become now, I don't know, what would be sort of memorable Americana, books that reflect a time, an idea, a period.

50:32.175 --> 50:40.707
Books that are, of course, they have to be, the set criterion has to be well written.

50:41.547 --> 50:45.974
to have had some kind of literary influence.

50:47.436 --> 50:48.759
Those usually go into it.

50:49.340 --> 51:01.319
But if you look at some of the ... I don't know, you know, what do you think about Philip Roth?

51:01.339 --> 51:03.442
Do you think he belongs in the Library of America?

51:03.603 --> 51:04.784
I like him.

51:04.804 --> 51:05.846
I like him a great deal.

51:06.067 --> 51:08.871
I like him better than Upton, just in terms of

51:10.403 --> 51:13.006
I really like Updike.

51:13.026 --> 51:14.208
I don't mean any disrespect.

51:14.288 --> 51:14.568
Yes.

51:15.410 --> 51:24.321
Well, again, you see, I think that probably... But I didn't answer your question.

51:24.341 --> 51:27.305
No, I think probably you're right.

51:27.365 --> 51:34.775
I think that there's something wonderfully accomplished about Updike, and so Barry has so many things he's good at.

51:36.798 --> 51:37.879
To me,

51:38.652 --> 51:43.619
The uptick I most admire is the uptick of the Rabbit series.

51:43.639 --> 51:44.721
Fabulous.

51:44.741 --> 51:45.081
Yeah.

51:45.101 --> 51:46.603
That's the high point for me.

51:47.124 --> 51:52.011
But of course he has many, many other... And you know, if he had done nothing else, that would be okay.

51:52.031 --> 51:52.251
Absolutely.

51:52.271 --> 51:53.072
That would be fine.

51:53.093 --> 51:53.874
That's right.

51:53.894 --> 51:57.278
The Rabbit books alone make a reputation.

51:57.319 --> 51:58.500
That's right.

51:58.600 --> 51:59.682
And they got better.

52:00.683 --> 52:01.164
That's right.

52:01.545 --> 52:05.791
Rabbit is Rich, I thought, was just, you know, that was the third one.

52:05.811 --> 52:08.254
That was just an extraordinary book.

52:08.723 --> 52:12.647
Yes, I think that he's never equaled at that.

52:12.667 --> 52:15.110
At least to me, that is the very best.

52:16.251 --> 52:24.380
And he's... See, he's just terribly intelligent.

52:24.460 --> 52:26.422
He's quite a reader, I think.

52:26.442 --> 52:27.903
I think he's quite a reader, too.

52:27.923 --> 52:28.884
That's right, he is.

52:29.105 --> 52:30.246
As is Roth, by the way.

52:30.486 --> 52:32.969
I know, yeah.

52:32.989 --> 52:33.810
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

52:33.890 --> 52:37.954
No, it's just... I think if you were to ask up today,

52:38.305 --> 52:40.808
what he would aspire to be as a writer?

52:40.848 --> 52:41.549
He'd say a poet.

52:42.930 --> 52:51.540
Well, you know, I did, I always liked his poetry when he first came out at the Queens that he did for magazines, New Yorker magazine and so forth.

52:51.560 --> 52:59.689
Some satirical and light verse, which he did with a great deal of skill and charm.

53:02.793 --> 53:04.535
He does a lot of art criticism now.

53:04.575 --> 53:05.977
Which is excellent.

53:05.997 --> 53:07.078
And I guess it's good.

53:07.118 --> 53:08.059
I don't, I don't really

53:09.203 --> 53:21.817
I read his stuff when Trot brings out the volumes, the collected stuff, which is kind of a nice way to do it.

53:21.837 --> 53:24.180
He's a tough guy to keep up with.

53:24.280 --> 53:29.265
I think that he'll certainly be in the Library of America.

53:33.810 --> 53:38.215
To me, in some ways, well, I don't want to make any invidious

53:39.376 --> 53:52.914
comparisons, but I think the rabbit books fit in my conception with the Library of America as some... Just continue with the product, you would.

53:53.395 --> 54:08.775
Well, even more than, in some ways, than Saul Bellow, although these are special things that I have always been a great admirer of Bellow, and have read him

54:10.257 --> 54:25.334
the way I've read few contemporary writers.

54:25.674 --> 54:33.543
I think of Updeck as being somehow a little more autochthonous American writer.

54:34.003 --> 54:35.765
What was that word again?

54:35.785 --> 54:38.408
Autochthonous.

54:39.788 --> 54:44.693
You know, of the natural coming out.

54:46.054 --> 54:57.285
For example, and this is just between us, I don't want to make any kind of comparisons between writers, particularly.

54:57.306 --> 54:58.567
That's very interesting that you point that out.

54:58.587 --> 54:58.927
Yes.

54:59.087 --> 54:59.788
And I won't.

54:59.808 --> 55:00.769
Yeah.

55:01.410 --> 55:04.473
For example, Singer.

55:04.493 --> 55:08.817
Now, they've published three Singer books in the Library of America.

55:10.163 --> 55:11.725
And he doesn't write even in English.

55:13.128 --> 55:16.873
He writes about this kind of American Jewish world.

55:18.075 --> 55:24.084
Seems still, I still don't see that he fits in it, but he is.

55:25.707 --> 55:26.829
So do you have these meanings?

55:28.010 --> 55:30.795
I no longer am, I'm only emeritus.

55:31.976 --> 55:36.323
I have nothing to do now with what is selected or anything like that.

55:36.978 --> 55:44.185
I talk to people, and I'm always asked and kept in touch with things and so forth.

55:44.726 --> 55:51.693
And I think many people have to see this as an ongoing operation.

55:51.873 --> 55:53.034
How are we going to sell books?

55:53.075 --> 55:54.015
What's going to be popular?

55:55.717 --> 55:58.780
So, it becomes that kind of less pure.

55:59.101 --> 56:00.702
Well, there's a element of commerce involved.

56:00.722 --> 56:02.344
That's exactly.

56:03.640 --> 56:15.571
And just to wake and wrap it up, because I know you've been very generous with your time, do you prefer the word classic to canon than looking at the big picture?

56:15.591 --> 56:17.673
I don't like the word canon.

56:17.693 --> 56:21.296
Especially where it comes from Scripture, almost, you know, talking about sacred texts.

56:21.317 --> 56:21.497
Exactly.

56:21.917 --> 56:23.058
I don't like the word canon.

56:24.239 --> 56:32.567
And classic is a very dubious word for me.

56:34.370 --> 56:39.155
unless you do it with a certain kind of quotation mark.

56:39.695 --> 56:42.878
What is classic American literature?

56:42.898 --> 56:50.025
Well, D. H. Lawrence's studies in classic American literature were his—who were the people he wrote about?

56:50.045 --> 56:50.806
Craig Kerr?

56:52.988 --> 56:53.348
Cooper?

56:56.031 --> 56:57.712
I love Cooper.

56:57.732 --> 57:00.175
I have a very special feeling about Cooper.

57:00.195 --> 57:02.757
The first American writer, probably, do you think?

57:04.863 --> 57:15.815
Well, again, I would hesitate to use these things, because when does American literature start becoming American literature?

57:15.835 --> 57:18.177
He's certainly one of the most self-conscious.

57:20.500 --> 57:28.508
And I love his book, The American Democrats, and a certain kind of

57:30.901 --> 57:37.611
I've been a general liberal in my point of view, but I've also been extremely interested in American conservatism of a certain kind.

57:39.113 --> 57:53.854
And he represents to me that quality.

57:59.335 --> 58:00.837
You've been very generous with your time.

58:01.799 --> 58:03.962
Well, I mean, we haven't had a chance to talk like this.

58:04.062 --> 58:06.105
I mean, I hope I haven't gassed too much.

58:06.125 --> 58:08.548
You must be... I could talk forever.

58:08.568 --> 58:14.397
It's just, I don't want to impose in your hospitality.

58:14.417 --> 58:15.258
It's a great tape.

58:15.398 --> 58:24.091
What I'd like to do is go back and transcribe it, and then maybe follow up if there are a few areas that we can, if you'd like to go over.

58:24.291 --> 58:27.235
Would you like to see any quotes of yours that I use?

58:27.636 --> 58:29.258
I have to say I'm very, very

58:29.727 --> 58:45.764
I've never had anyone... The only thing that I'm concerned with is appearing to be important, appearing to be... Yeah, not appearing.

58:45.784 --> 58:54.713
I'm here, because I feel it's really important, as do, you know, thousands of your admirers.

58:54.753 --> 58:55.954
My editor at Harper's is

58:56.305 --> 58:58.909
So thrilled that I had you on my short list of people.

58:59.029 --> 59:00.171
I can understand that.

59:00.211 --> 59:01.192
He went to Harvard.

59:01.253 --> 59:04.878
He certainly knows, his name is Hugh Van Dusen.

59:04.898 --> 59:05.780
I don't know if you ever heard of him.

59:06.100 --> 59:08.063
He's Jacques Barsen's editor at Harvard.

59:08.083 --> 59:09.485
He still is.

59:09.665 --> 59:12.971
That book that just came out a couple of years ago that was a huge bestseller.

59:13.151 --> 59:13.912
Do you know what I mean?

59:14.293 --> 59:14.453
Yeah.

59:14.473 --> 59:15.294
It's a big, big book.

59:15.434 --> 59:15.895
That's right.

59:16.155 --> 59:16.676
That's right.

59:16.696 --> 59:20.502
He's the oldest writer to ever make the New York Times bestseller list.

59:20.522 --> 59:23.747
And quite pointedly, without any illustrations, he said, I want it just

59:24.352 --> 59:31.242
I was telling, in fact, my editor is also Harper Lee's editor, although she hasn't published the book, you know, that one book.

59:32.343 --> 59:38.172
And I was telling him how a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird sold for $33,000 at Christie's sale.

59:38.212 --> 59:41.637
This was a few years ago, the first edition.

59:42.538 --> 59:45.863
And he said, do you know how many copies of that book we sell a year?

59:46.203 --> 59:47.525
This is harmless.

59:47.545 --> 59:48.807
Now, obviously, paperback.

59:50.339 --> 59:52.001
Take a wild guess.

59:52.021 --> 59:54.704
This is her editor at Harford Stock.

59:54.724 --> 59:57.667
Sorry, this is not 5,000.

59:57.688 --> 01:00:00.090
How about 250,000 copies a year?

01:00:01.172 --> 01:00:04.195
Quarter of a million copies a year that book sells.

01:00:04.636 --> 01:00:06.338
Amazing paperbacks.

01:00:06.758 --> 01:00:09.341
Every school reads them.

01:00:10.082 --> 01:00:14.507
Every public school, the course, they'll do a thing on whether

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:20.324
or whatever, or whether it's a great novel, it's read everywhere.

01:00:20.424 --> 01:00:22.152
And he said, we do 200.
