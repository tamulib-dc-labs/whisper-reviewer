00:01.735 --> 00:04.759
Tom, could you tell me your full name and your title?

00:05.320 --> 00:08.985
Thomas Albro, Acting Chief of the Conservation Division.

00:09.005 --> 00:10.326
Okay, and how do you spell your name, Tom?

00:10.446 --> 00:11.348
A-L-B-R-O.

00:11.768 --> 00:14.572
Okay, and why don't you tell me where we are?

00:15.273 --> 00:26.848
This is the book conservation section of the Conservation Division, and as the name would imply, it is where we deal with the conservation treatment of bound rare materials.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.266
rare is a very key adjective in that.

00:30.546 --> 00:30.846
It is.

00:31.007 --> 00:32.889
That affords us the salaries we get.

00:32.989 --> 00:36.153
Can I just leave this someplace so I can take some notes, too?

00:37.014 --> 00:38.276
Okay, good.

00:38.296 --> 00:39.818
Okay, good.

00:39.838 --> 00:45.645
I'm just going to put this here.

00:45.665 --> 00:46.306
So go ahead, Tom.

00:46.406 --> 00:46.746
I'm sorry.

00:47.207 --> 00:49.570
Thomas, would you use a middle initial?

00:49.590 --> 00:51.132
C. A.

00:51.348 --> 00:55.375
L-B-R-O, comma, the second is me.

00:55.475 --> 00:56.477
I am, in fact.

00:56.497 --> 00:57.038
Well, there you go.

00:57.278 --> 00:58.440
And that's the whole manual.

00:59.001 --> 01:00.784
And you are just for the same one?

01:00.804 --> 01:03.129
Acting Chief of the Conservation Bureau.

01:03.149 --> 01:03.609
Okay, good.

01:04.271 --> 01:06.334
So go ahead, I interrupted you while you were saying.

01:06.354 --> 01:08.177
We were talking about the preservation of the rare book.

01:08.217 --> 01:10.341
Well, this is the rare book conservation section.

01:10.642 --> 01:13.727
There are three sections in terms of specialties in the offices.

01:13.960 --> 01:29.198
We have rare book conservation, we have art on paper conservation, and we have a concept of conservation called phased conservation, which essentially is stabilization as opposed to actual one-on-one treatment.

01:29.218 --> 01:43.275
What you see here primarily is an individual item selected from the collection through a process of negotiation between the conservator and the curator based on its importance to the library and based on its

01:43.576 --> 01:44.137
condition.

01:45.398 --> 01:54.627
Theoretically, most valuable, worst condition is where we start and then work our way down through the 117 million authors.

01:55.808 --> 01:58.150
Who makes the decision of importance?

01:58.170 --> 02:00.532
That would be a curatorial decision.

02:00.552 --> 02:01.533
And it's very subjective.

02:02.434 --> 02:04.837
And you can't really argue with it.

02:04.877 --> 02:12.604
I mean, a person in the geography and math division is going to have a different notion of what constitutes importance as a person who works in the music division.

02:13.006 --> 02:30.087
Periodically, there are attempts on the part of management to sort of put down a set of guidelines which would be standard to the library for selection, but it's normally Shoup shouted down pretty quickly because it just is not a very sensible objective.

02:31.689 --> 02:42.523
In any case, we then work with each curator and work out every year a proposal which we give to that division which assigns our points or hours broken down

02:43.297 --> 03:01.390
based on a contract which says this is what we're going to do for you in these three areas of specialty book paper and phase so this is all figured out

03:01.657 --> 03:07.222
If this is all determined, well, in advance, you don't get any, there's no triage here.

03:07.242 --> 03:08.864
You don't get any emergency cases.

03:08.884 --> 03:09.324
Oh, we do.

03:09.384 --> 03:10.225
No, we do, certainly.

03:10.285 --> 03:21.656
Sometimes material will be accessioned, which is too badly damaged or in such a condition that it can't be catalogued, and we would have to fix it then.

03:21.676 --> 03:25.860
There are four main processes by which work comes down here.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.663
We have a series of ongoing projects that have gone on for years.

03:29.683 --> 03:31.545
The Jefferson Collection, naturally.

03:31.846 --> 03:38.657
The Rosenwald Collection, the Cabinet of American Illustration, the Moldenauer Music Management Collection.

03:38.677 --> 03:45.909
Huge collections of very, very important materials, which we work bit by bit on an ongoing process.

03:46.530 --> 03:51.097
We have materials that are accessioned, as I said, and need to be worked on right away.

03:51.758 --> 03:56.065
We have exhibit issues, where we have an exhibit like the American Treasure Show,

03:56.483 --> 03:58.967
Things have to go on exhibit looking a certain way.

03:58.987 --> 04:01.832
But you probably know a year in advance that you're going to have an exhibition.

04:02.353 --> 04:03.755
Well, that's the theory.

04:03.775 --> 04:05.718
The practice not always is that way.

04:05.758 --> 04:10.827
The curators often are making up their minds about what's going to go into the show two weeks before the show opens.

04:11.067 --> 04:16.456
And the fourth way is that we need to work on a certain set of things all the time.

04:17.097 --> 04:19.521
In order for the skills that we have to be maintained,

04:19.703 --> 04:22.487
You can't work on a certain type of binding once every five years.

04:22.587 --> 04:24.350
You've got to do it all the time.

04:24.370 --> 04:32.843
Or you're not doing justice to the craft aspect of the work, as opposed to just kind of, you know, thundering through something the same as done.

04:32.863 --> 04:35.968
Now, you mentioned the figure 117 million or whatever it was.

04:36.008 --> 04:36.189
Right.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.312
Okay.

04:39.013 --> 04:42.859
You're never going to do that in several lifetimes.

04:43.328 --> 04:48.217
But how many objects a year are you able to?

04:48.237 --> 04:48.738
It varies.

04:48.918 --> 04:50.561
This is just an example.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.511
This is last year's annual report.

04:56.571 --> 04:58.114
The question was just asked.

04:58.904 --> 05:04.112
Is there a copy of that around that I can... You can have this copy.

05:04.132 --> 05:06.335
I'm sure you can get another copy.

05:07.116 --> 05:10.922
For example, this is the preservation division.

05:11.182 --> 05:12.784
This is the preservation division.

05:12.804 --> 05:17.271
That does not necessarily mean us exclusively.

05:17.291 --> 05:17.892
I understand.

05:17.912 --> 05:24.321
But the way that we're obliged to sort of cram the figures to a funnel so that they come out in this reflection...

05:24.757 --> 05:25.858
is indicative.

05:26.039 --> 05:27.160
Volumes treated, $4,000.

05:27.180 --> 05:30.324
Unbound paper-based items treated, $6,000.

05:30.384 --> 05:32.347
Commercial library binding volumes, $199.

05:32.828 --> 05:36.252
Books you send out to somebody to get them bound for $12 a piece.

05:36.272 --> 05:36.993
Outsourcing.

05:37.414 --> 05:38.275
Outsourcing, yes.

05:38.535 --> 05:39.957
To use the euphemism.

05:39.977 --> 05:40.979
Yes, yes.

05:41.019 --> 05:43.021
This has been going on for years.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.063
And then rehousings.

05:44.884 --> 05:46.185
So that gives you a general idea.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.507
Rehousing being what?

05:48.629 --> 05:53.355
Instead of actually treating the object, simply physically protecting it with a box.

05:54.016 --> 05:54.156
Mm-hmm.

05:54.659 --> 05:55.019
I see.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.141
Or taking housing.

05:56.201 --> 06:00.045
Clamshell boxes, mylar things, if we do that, or whatever.

06:00.145 --> 06:01.647
Folders, envelopes, whatever.

06:02.628 --> 06:03.889
So that's a fairly big number.

06:04.310 --> 06:06.112
And all that is done in this?

06:06.792 --> 06:08.674
Generally speaking, not in this area.

06:08.815 --> 06:11.738
I mean, this is all single-item, full-treatment conservation.

06:12.078 --> 06:16.463
Most of the things that go in here are going to cost 50 hours to 500 hours.

06:17.484 --> 06:18.085
They could write them.

06:18.786 --> 06:20.047
Yeah, depending on the... Really?

06:20.267 --> 06:20.367
Yeah.

06:20.387 --> 06:22.470
Well, you're talking about the tip-top.

06:22.490 --> 06:24.632
You're talking about things in many cases which...

06:25.338 --> 06:27.802
the value is almost that a sign of it.

06:28.062 --> 06:30.306
Can you give me an example of a 500-hour item?

06:30.426 --> 06:33.891
Yeah, the Houdini scrapbook of a few years ago.

06:34.452 --> 06:41.844
In other words, a scrapbook put together by Houdini, filled with incredible materials.

06:42.004 --> 06:47.953
But a scrapbook in and of itself is just filled with all sorts of different things.

06:48.494 --> 06:50.597
And it's a unique item as well.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.742
Newspapers, posters.

06:54.278 --> 06:56.782
All of them folded up and jammed into an album.

06:56.942 --> 06:57.643
Was it one album?

06:57.843 --> 06:58.324
Yes.

06:58.344 --> 06:59.746
Wow.

07:00.007 --> 07:11.164
So what had to happen in this particular case was, clearly they could not all go back into the album and be treated as well, because you have to unfold them, and then they don't fit in the album anymore.

07:11.184 --> 07:21.239
What we did is we took cipochrome photographs of each page as it was originally, in the words you have essentially the facsimile, and that was bound up to be used as a resource.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.902
And then each of the items was treated,

07:23.371 --> 07:26.895
and then reallocated to another album in a different order.

07:27.996 --> 07:34.343
But you had, you know, you had three or four hundred objects, essentially, going back into these bindings.

07:34.363 --> 07:35.784
And it was very, very labor-intensive.

07:35.804 --> 07:38.047
And it was probably more than five hundred hours.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.168
It was probably closer to eight hundred.

07:39.228 --> 07:39.468
Wow.

07:39.909 --> 07:41.710
And you had more than one person working on it?

07:41.730 --> 07:43.232
Yeah, sure.

07:43.252 --> 07:44.714
Here, I'll just put this... Okay, yeah, thanks.

07:44.754 --> 07:46.115
I hope you don't mind.

07:46.155 --> 07:46.856
No, it's fine.

07:46.896 --> 07:49.679
You saved me a call to my car response to somebody.

07:49.899 --> 07:51.741
You're welcome to have a copy of the annual report.

07:52.160 --> 07:59.950
And the average kind of work that we do, and we can look at some of this, probably is hitting right on about 100 hours.

08:01.311 --> 08:21.576
If you calculate that, in most cases, the value of the objects are going to run from 50,000 to, I mean, inestimable, if you're talking about the rough draft or, you know, Lincoln's Gettysburg address to the million-dollar to the several hundred-thousand-dollar range, those costs bear up very well, you know, the value of the items.

08:22.282 --> 08:24.584
This is not a production-oriented place.

08:24.824 --> 08:28.328
It's a place that is high in symbolic content as well.

08:28.628 --> 08:39.618
As you mentioned before, the unachievable goal of taking care of the library's entire collection.

08:39.638 --> 08:40.959
It's not possible.

08:41.139 --> 08:43.081
No one's even pretending that he can.

08:44.523 --> 08:51.529
But we're obliged to at least be making an effort and making an effort at the highest possible level.

08:52.673 --> 08:54.556
Now, if we could digress just a minute.

08:54.576 --> 09:04.570
Chris, who's from the exhibit's office, needs to look at something in the vault, the treasure's vault, and I think you were scheduled to get a look in there anyway, so this is not a bad time.

09:04.590 --> 09:04.831
Let's do it.

09:04.851 --> 09:05.772
Terrific.

09:05.792 --> 09:07.074
Can I just leave that stuff there?

09:07.094 --> 09:07.554
Yeah, you can.

09:07.575 --> 09:10.559
And I'll, I promise not to... I'll put my pen away.

09:12.221 --> 09:13.062
I know the protocol.

09:18.150 --> 09:21.094
Into the environmental treasure.

09:21.985 --> 09:47.048
probably a better name is top treasure's vault okay well that's the key from here

09:49.441 --> 09:53.586
Tell me something about this chamber that we're entering.

09:55.448 --> 10:02.297
This is a chamber for the purposes of storing the library's designated top treasures.

10:02.818 --> 10:03.138
Wow.

10:04.159 --> 10:14.492
It's a cold storage vault and it maintains a constant temperature and humidity as well as very highly sophisticated security.

10:14.512 --> 10:16.815
I'm going to put my pen away so there's no pain.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.424
It's a pretty small chamber then, isn't it?

10:20.844 --> 10:25.151
Is this stuff here just for the short term?

10:25.291 --> 10:37.749
No, these are designated the top treasures of the Library of Congress and were designated so around the time of the invasion of Pearl Harbor, and these were the materials which would be taken from the library and stored in Fort Knox.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.512
This is a very important room.

10:39.998 --> 10:53.659
I'm looking at the Emancipation Proclamation, as first sketched and shown to the Cabinet, 1862, June 19, 1775.

10:53.879 --> 10:59.989
We're going to take this out so we can measure it, and we can come back in here and look around.

11:00.029 --> 11:06.799
You don't mind if I have a few goose pimples?

11:07.555 --> 11:16.247
I really get my kicks out of things like this.

11:16.288 --> 11:29.226
Wow.

11:33.897 --> 11:37.301
And you're removing this now for what purpose?

11:37.321 --> 11:39.084
Well, he's going to do some measurements.

11:39.104 --> 11:40.826
This is going into the treasurer's show.

11:41.427 --> 11:41.747
I see.

11:42.027 --> 11:46.673
And so it will go into the top treasurer's case in the exhibit.

11:46.693 --> 11:56.005
But it needs to be measured so that a housing can be made for it, so that it can sit in the exhibition looking as though it was actually intended to be there.

11:56.025 --> 12:01.272
Because all of the top treasurers go into a special case, but they're not all the same shape, size, or format.

12:02.146 --> 12:05.850
So Chris is stuck with having to figure out how to shove it in the case.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.271
6-19-75.

12:07.331 --> 12:13.598
So this is the opposite.

12:13.618 --> 12:17.201
That's pretty exciting, isn't it?

12:17.221 --> 12:18.323
To George Washington.

12:18.403 --> 12:19.083
No, I've got to get back.

12:19.103 --> 12:19.804
OK, can I go with you?

12:19.824 --> 12:20.785
You can come back with me.

12:20.805 --> 12:22.267
He'll be here with us for a bit, right?

12:22.287 --> 12:24.449
OK, I'm just— Five minutes, next time.

12:24.469 --> 12:24.749
OK.

12:24.769 --> 12:25.370
Remember last time?

12:25.390 --> 12:27.712
It took you a long time to get the measurements.

12:27.732 --> 12:27.993
OK.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.734
You know?

12:29.754 --> 12:30.415
Maybe an hour.

12:32.048 --> 12:37.172
Well, you can touch something, but you can't put it in the book.

12:37.553 --> 12:39.414
No, no, no.

12:39.575 --> 12:41.376
Tell me some of these things.

12:41.436 --> 12:43.558
The Emancipation Proclamation.

12:44.399 --> 12:45.980
Mason's miscellaneous letters.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.962
1763 to 91.

12:49.563 --> 12:51.965
Madison's Notes on the Constitutional Convention.

12:52.005 --> 13:00.773
Lincoln's first inaugural, which is really 3461, which is, I think, one of the most wonderful things we have.

13:01.107 --> 13:03.191
Here's two volumes of the Gutenberg Bible.

13:03.211 --> 13:04.353
The other one's on exhibit.

13:04.373 --> 13:05.815
This is the Gutenberg Bible.

13:05.895 --> 13:07.939
Yeah, would you like to look at a copy?

13:08.119 --> 13:08.540
Yeah, I would.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.481
I've held on one.

13:09.561 --> 13:11.425
I've touched one once, Mr. Scheides.

13:11.645 --> 13:14.831
This is the Beckley copy of the Bill of Rights.

13:15.231 --> 13:15.632
The which?

13:16.473 --> 13:19.619
Beckley, John Beckley, who was the clerk of the House of Representatives.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.143
And what have you got it in?

13:22.183 --> 13:26.811
These right here are argon-filled chambers.

13:27.263 --> 13:34.575
In other words, non-oxygen filled environments for some of the smaller ones that Gettysburg addressed there.

13:35.978 --> 13:39.223
Declaration of Independence, rough draft.

13:39.384 --> 13:43.230
That is the rough draft in Jefferson Town.

13:43.497 --> 14:12.019
you know everything's scratched out in the in alien we're talking about objects of inestimable value to the united states of america yeah this is the first uh this is the um reading copy alleged purported purported yeah that's a tricky issue alleged is too it's too much a client that's right purported yeah this is uh let's put that in green don't worry uh well this is volume of three i think

14:12.843 --> 14:15.468
That came with the Mulberry collection, I believe it did?

14:15.488 --> 14:15.749
Oh, it did.

14:15.769 --> 14:16.310
It did.

14:16.851 --> 14:23.704
Jefferson's first and now he wrote an autobiography of Lincoln, another autobiography of Lincoln, the Columbus Codex.

14:25.047 --> 14:28.253
The Columbus Codex being what?

14:29.127 --> 14:44.802
This is the book that Columbus put together denoting his demands or his requirements for his discovery of the New World.

14:45.423 --> 14:48.570
A lengthy, lengthy book written on vellum that he had ascribed to.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.238
This is inscribed, did you say?

14:51.338 --> 14:54.203
Well, it's written on vellum, and he had a scribe writing.

14:54.223 --> 14:55.906
He had a scribe, okay.

14:55.926 --> 15:05.903
And it was, in a sense, he was presenting this to the King of Queens, saying, now, I've done this for you, this is what I'd like done for me, you know, a commander of the Urshan Seas, etc., etc.

15:06.263 --> 15:10.170
And also, there's a papal bull in the front from Alexander VI, and

15:10.150 --> 15:26.557
And these are items that you said, these were designated, I guess, during World War II as items... As the category top treasure.

15:27.058 --> 15:30.663
If we had to evacuate Washington, what are the things we're going to take with us?

15:31.505 --> 15:34.690
These are the ones that... Now, it's interesting.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.636
And we can actually go outside if you're getting a... No, I'm not.

15:38.976 --> 15:41.280
This is quite thrilling, actually.

15:41.300 --> 15:47.730
Because one of the things that's happening now is, of course, we've acquired a great many more things.

15:47.750 --> 15:55.242
And the logical extension of that is, well, should we limit our top treasures to this pitifully small number?

15:55.262 --> 15:58.407
Well, I think we should probably estimate the size of this room.

15:58.467 --> 16:02.854
I would say probably 10 by 10, 12 by 12.

16:03.222 --> 16:05.566
maybe eight feet tall if it's that high.

16:06.828 --> 16:07.629
Like a ceiling.

16:07.649 --> 16:08.510
A ceiling.

16:08.991 --> 16:12.817
And so there is some undercurrent discussion as there has been for years.

16:12.877 --> 16:22.131
Well, other divisions, this is primarily manuscript material, manuscript division material, other divisions have things that they would like to claim as top treasures as well.

16:22.151 --> 16:31.626
Now, the fact of the matter is that would open such a can of worms of subjectivity and debate and political infighting

16:32.011 --> 16:36.576
that this list, which is a manageable 18, could very well be 350.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.658
Is this 18 items in here?

16:38.678 --> 16:40.079
Is that what it is?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.241
Is there a list in some place with the 18?

16:42.261 --> 16:43.543
There is, yeah.

16:43.563 --> 16:44.384
Is that something I can get?

16:44.464 --> 16:45.765
You'd have to ask permission.

16:45.785 --> 16:46.726
You couldn't ask it from me.

16:46.746 --> 16:48.748
You asked it from Diane.

16:48.768 --> 16:49.088
She's my boss.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.631
She may say I could go ahead and give it to you.

16:52.111 --> 16:58.558
But it has always been a security list, but in recent years, people have felt that

16:59.230 --> 17:02.297
that security was sort of anti-democratic.

17:02.457 --> 17:05.564
Well, it doesn't sound hard to figure out some of the things that are in here.

17:05.584 --> 17:10.695
No, no, especially if you're standing here looking at the labels.

17:10.835 --> 17:12.779
I can, I can.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.906
But it basically is, well, no, it's not all basically that.

17:16.291 --> 17:25.704
You have Civil War material, you have Revolutionary material, you have Federal material, you have Incunabula, which really doesn't fit into the top treasure of the nation.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.588
And there is a giant Bible of Mines copy here.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.072
Well, that used to be out... There's two volumes to it.

17:32.092 --> 17:37.860
There are two volumes, so the second volume of the... I'm going to be in months in two weeks, but...

17:37.840 --> 17:42.364
I'm going to Leipzig, by the way, to see what they're doing.

17:42.464 --> 17:43.265
With the paper splitting?

17:43.746 --> 17:45.547
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of stuff you don't do here.

17:46.348 --> 17:46.828
We don't, no.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.850
It's a different philosophy of preservation, isn't it?

17:48.870 --> 17:49.651
A very different philosophy.

17:49.671 --> 17:52.494
Maybe you could even... Well, why don't we... You can continue.

17:52.514 --> 17:56.377
Well, the gentleman that's doing it, Mr. Vector, is very well known.

17:56.397 --> 17:57.699
In fact, he's been here.

17:57.719 --> 17:59.641
He's visited here, so I'm interviewing him.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.541
He's a very nice man.

18:00.561 --> 18:02.703
There was a time when I took after the collapse of the wall.

18:02.723 --> 18:06.547
They thought he was a Stasi, but I think that's when he passed away.

18:07.268 --> 18:07.628
And...

18:07.996 --> 18:12.683
I mean, they have embraced technology differently than we have.

18:12.723 --> 18:15.006
They would like to get large numbers of things done.

18:15.807 --> 18:25.020
Paper splitting is a way that you take a document, put it on two rollers, it's separated, and then something is inserted in between, and then it's bonded all back together again.

18:26.903 --> 18:27.283
All done?

18:27.423 --> 18:27.804
All done.

18:27.824 --> 18:28.865
That was pretty quick.

18:29.486 --> 18:29.747
Yeah.

18:29.767 --> 18:30.848
We got better.

18:31.189 --> 18:32.971
It's a little more basic than these caskets.

18:33.071 --> 18:33.632
And what are these?

18:33.752 --> 18:34.273
All right.

18:35.374 --> 18:35.715
I'll put it back.

18:35.735 --> 18:35.835
Okay.

18:35.855 --> 18:37.477
Thanks very much.

18:37.497 --> 18:37.918
Appreciate it.

18:39.333 --> 18:43.660
I'm thinking that this is one of the things that's all exhibited.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.343
So these aren't part of the actual 18?

18:45.443 --> 18:45.864
No, they are.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.370
Yeah, this is one of them.

18:49.410 --> 18:53.297
This is the first inaugural and the second inaugural.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.342
I wonder how they came to 18.

18:58.024 --> 18:59.086
That, I don't know.

18:59.106 --> 19:02.272
Has this been pretty much just a consistent number?

19:02.412 --> 19:03.113
It hasn't changed.

19:03.329 --> 19:04.891
There's always been that one number.

19:04.931 --> 19:06.893
And this was done during McLeish's, I guess?

19:07.033 --> 19:07.273
Yes.

19:07.754 --> 19:11.798
And I wonder why they decided to take a Lincoln letter to Benjamin Rush, for instance.

19:11.838 --> 19:12.779
How does that qualify?

19:12.799 --> 19:13.499
Jefferson letter.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.702
I'm not sure— Oh, I'm sorry, did I say it?

19:15.722 --> 19:16.462
Oh, is it Lincoln?

19:16.502 --> 19:17.263
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

19:17.283 --> 19:20.266
You have to read the letter to know that.

19:20.507 --> 19:27.033
The person to talk to, the specialist in that period, is Jerry Gawalt, who would know the history of it.

19:27.073 --> 19:30.737
This must be the second in order of Abraham Lincoln.

19:32.776 --> 19:34.460
That's what Lincoln's second inaugural is?

19:34.480 --> 19:38.230
Yeah, then the first inaugural is up above.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.718
In terms of presidents, I think you only have three presidents represented in here.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.044
Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln, yeah.

19:44.064 --> 19:48.034
You've got Lincoln, you've got Jefferson, the first inaugural.

19:48.706 --> 19:50.989
I'm getting it out.

19:51.009 --> 19:54.514
If you don't mind.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.397
I probably won't even use this, but this is kind of exciting.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.000
Well, it's fun.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.762
It's the kind of thing I'm interested in, though.

20:00.822 --> 20:01.944
The artifact, you know.

20:02.684 --> 20:09.253
What is there about the artifact, you know, if digital technology can replicate with such fidelity?

20:09.594 --> 20:10.014
It can.

20:11.356 --> 20:11.977
Say that again.

20:12.137 --> 20:12.938
It can.

20:12.958 --> 20:13.959
Will it ever be able to?

20:14.700 --> 20:17.104
But I think there's a... You can't ever say never.

20:17.124 --> 20:17.464
But...

20:17.866 --> 20:40.693
I mean, the point is, if somebody looks at the Duke DeBerry's Trey Richeur at the University of Chicago on his computer, and then says, or thinks that he has looked at the Trey Richeur and doesn't have to go to the Metropolitan, and of course doesn't look at it, he is about 180 degrees raw, it seems.

20:40.713 --> 20:42.996
He has not seen the original view.

20:44.478 --> 20:45.739
That's the U.S.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.381
Constitution printed.

20:47.401 --> 20:49.303
That's the first printed Constitution.

20:49.323 --> 20:50.765
Yeah, the Dunlap.

20:51.746 --> 20:53.588
The Dunlap in play.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.532
Well, this is pretty essential stuff.

20:56.872 --> 21:02.458
How does this differ from materials that are in the possession of the National Archives, just out of curiosity?

21:03.099 --> 21:04.380
Do they have items of equal?

21:04.460 --> 21:06.363
I mean, they certainly have the original technology.

21:06.383 --> 21:10.367
They have the original two, although they were here for a long time as well.

21:11.428 --> 21:13.911
It's separated by public and personal papers.

21:14.363 --> 21:21.533
A lot of these are these people's personal papers, and those have always come to the library up through the Theatre of Orozco.

21:21.553 --> 21:31.528
And then after that, of course, you have a lot of presidential libraries that take care of it.

21:31.897 --> 21:33.820
I mean, this is more than a refrigerator.

21:33.881 --> 21:36.124
It's more than a cooler.

21:36.185 --> 21:52.774
Well, it's environmentally very balanced, temperature ranging around 48 degrees, relative humidity probably in the neighborhood of 45 degrees, a lot of security.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.293
which I can't talk about.

21:55.313 --> 22:06.048
No, I mentioned it, which I don't want to know about, believe it or not, but that's, you know, I can see the security, but I'm thinking in terms of the environmental concerns, and it's a double-lock situation.

22:06.068 --> 22:09.934
Now, does this have that halon stuff, is that what they call it?

22:09.954 --> 22:12.537
It has a system for fire prevention.

22:12.557 --> 22:17.965
You know, halon is a bit problematic because of the fact that, of course, it replaces oxygen and kills people.

22:18.285 --> 22:22.491
Yeah, if you can only get an halon, you're in bad trouble.

22:23.635 --> 22:24.917
So you don't have that.

22:26.579 --> 22:33.528
Let me just take a look at it.

22:33.548 --> 22:40.076
I would have to say that I was not the person who created this environment.

22:40.157 --> 22:45.423
I would have to say, I don't know if it's hell out or not.

22:45.644 --> 22:47.466
I honestly don't know what the fire's presence is, but fire's presence.

22:48.374 --> 22:49.495
I have a question.

22:49.516 --> 22:50.797
It's very sophisticated.

22:50.817 --> 22:54.963
Yeah, so sophisticated I wasn't able to describe it.

22:54.983 --> 22:58.287
And are these, is this like a seismic thing here?

22:58.307 --> 23:00.570
This is keeping track of what's going on out there.

23:00.590 --> 23:10.484
What I'm going to do is close this up and go and get the Hancock and bring it back and put it in.

23:10.504 --> 23:11.305
Can I stand here?

23:11.345 --> 23:12.807
You can stand there.

23:12.827 --> 23:14.289
Take some notes.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.310
He was saying...

23:16.555 --> 23:31.215
I'd like to follow up on that, that there's no way, in your view—and look at this here, we have a little— This is from this particular colonial pamphlet from the Jefferson collection.

23:32.316 --> 23:33.738
That's Thomas Jefferson's books?

23:33.918 --> 23:34.139
Yeah.

23:34.159 --> 23:36.361
Is that his book plate?

23:36.382 --> 23:36.462
Yep.

23:37.243 --> 23:40.066
It's the Library of Congress book plate for his collection.

23:40.687 --> 23:41.989
That's his handwriting.

23:42.830 --> 23:53.402
And this was a folded up oration delivered in New York on the 4th of July, 1796, which for some reason or another, he felt compelled to keep.

23:54.203 --> 23:57.547
Now we've unfolded it because it wasn't accessible and nor was it handleable.

23:58.228 --> 24:06.217
And we're going to actually put it in another binding, this being a compilation anyway, adjacent to this, because this is where it was.

24:06.317 --> 24:07.839
Well, it was bound or it was folded?

24:08.039 --> 24:09.681
It was folded up and sewn in.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.452
Where were the original folds?

24:12.612 --> 24:13.674
I can see them.

24:14.134 --> 24:16.677
Right here, you can see them just a little bit.

24:16.697 --> 24:18.560
It was folded in half.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.861
There, there, there.

24:20.202 --> 24:24.367
Why don't you tell me what's been done to that?

24:25.108 --> 24:26.209
Well, this has been taken out.

24:26.330 --> 24:29.854
It's been flattened.

24:29.914 --> 24:34.219
There is mending that's taken place, and you can see it here in various places.

24:35.661 --> 24:36.362
Let's see.

24:37.604 --> 24:38.605
Yeah.

24:38.905 --> 24:41.410
That's fine.

24:41.630 --> 24:42.091
That's fine.

24:42.111 --> 24:44.035
Not a problem.

24:44.235 --> 24:47.161
All these areas have been reinforced.

24:48.223 --> 24:48.984
You can see there.

24:50.387 --> 24:52.050
I meant you put your top people on this.

24:52.932 --> 24:55.136
Well, most everybody is top people.

24:55.156 --> 25:00.306
I mean, we have people who were junior and people who were senior, but they're all very good.

25:00.326 --> 25:01.909
I mean, this is another

25:02.243 --> 25:06.611
Are they all multi-skilled, or do they go from this to a book?

25:07.012 --> 25:11.300
Well, everybody in here does books primarily, but books and manuscripts.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.083
This is something that's being mended.

25:13.244 --> 25:18.053
This was damaged on the side, and it's going to be put back into the book that it was in.

25:19.736 --> 25:22.301
In fact, I need to get something on here.

25:22.341 --> 25:25.787
What's your particular background?

25:26.138 --> 25:40.260
Well, I've been here sort of since 72, when they opened a training program, and I had a degree in history and thought that this sounded like a nice way to mess with it.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.744
Somehow it got the job.

25:42.764 --> 25:45.428
So you learn preservation here, basically.

25:45.448 --> 25:48.132
I haven't been anyplace since.

25:48.212 --> 25:49.995
Really, no reason to.

25:50.015 --> 25:50.776
There's so much here.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.699
This is interesting that I enjoy.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.542
This is also from the Jefferson Collection.

25:55.636 --> 26:00.603
recently just rebound, and it was in, actually, the exhibition has yet to be tooled.

26:01.104 --> 26:03.007
That's a new binding, or that's this binding?

26:03.027 --> 26:04.249
That's a new binding that we did here.

26:04.509 --> 26:04.870
Really?

26:04.930 --> 26:06.672
The other binding was a mess.

26:07.714 --> 26:15.786
This is... Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion, in two parts by Henry Hume.

26:16.827 --> 26:19.972
And he was a Scottish philosopher.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.297
And this is, and I can never remember where it is,

26:23.648 --> 26:26.232
There's no foxing there at all.

26:26.312 --> 26:28.255
No, it's in pretty good shape.

26:28.796 --> 26:40.272
This is regarded to be the place where the phrase, pursuit of happiness, was revealed as a political objective to Jefferson.

26:40.292 --> 26:46.281
On the Law of Nature, page 78, and you were pointing out a sentence which...

26:46.717 --> 26:58.788
Unless it be made appear that there is a principle of benevolence in man which prompts him to an equal pursuit of the happiness of all.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.010
Very interesting.

27:01.030 --> 27:06.955
Well, it was interesting, too, where we get the well-springs of creativity come from.

27:07.035 --> 27:14.602
Well, I've heard the program on Jefferson, which was on TV recently, refers to him getting this from John Locke.

27:15.222 --> 27:15.863
That's Hume.

27:16.923 --> 27:19.327
But I think it's this fellow, not John Locke.

27:19.948 --> 27:25.236
But it was interesting, too, because a few years ago, we had a group of, what was the date on that, just out of curiosity?

27:28.782 --> 27:29.002
The 60s.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.985
I don't think I sent the date into my machine.

27:32.908 --> 27:35.792
MDCCLI 61.

27:35.813 --> 27:36.253
1551.

27:36.674 --> 27:38.597
So that's 25 years.

27:38.617 --> 27:39.939
24 years.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.825
We had some of the pen,

27:44.142 --> 27:50.590
the pen authors, and I didn't really know.

27:50.630 --> 27:53.934
You could see some of the faces were familiar, but I didn't know them all.

27:54.455 --> 28:00.262
So this happened to have just been finished, and I was showing it to some, and this one woman just latched onto it.

28:00.282 --> 28:01.904
She was just, that's fascinating.

28:01.944 --> 28:05.769
She was reading it and commenting on how interesting it was.

28:05.789 --> 28:11.616
Well, it was the lady who is Deborah Tannen, the linguist from Georgetown University.

28:11.976 --> 28:13.238
I mean, she just couldn't

28:13.488 --> 28:15.370
She was just mesmerized.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.952
Of course, language and communication is her baby.

28:18.633 --> 28:20.515
And it was just funny, because she gave me her card.

28:20.535 --> 28:23.017
I said, well, I'll send you a Xerox with the page if you like.

28:23.037 --> 28:25.279
And so she gave me the card and said her name.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.422
I said, I think I know why you are.

28:27.582 --> 28:28.563
Great.

28:29.003 --> 28:31.926
I hope we can sit down with that.

28:31.946 --> 28:32.146
All right.

28:32.166 --> 28:35.449
We can also walk around to look at things, because we have a lot going on.

28:35.489 --> 28:37.091
It's up to you.

28:37.111 --> 28:43.377
I'm just really kind of interested in this whole aspect of

28:43.863 --> 28:48.469
book culture, where we're going with books, our commitment to printed books.

28:50.232 --> 29:07.256
Diane indicated that there are instances where you will opt for either the microfilm or the scanned copy of something, and the printed book will have been deemed to have no artifactual value.

29:07.336 --> 29:11.001
I don't think you'd get into that end of it down here.

29:11.352 --> 29:13.955
No, that's a policy decision.

29:14.035 --> 29:22.444
Clearly, in many cases, it's easier for them to provide data with microfilm copies or digitized copies.

29:22.884 --> 29:39.081
I would say, though, that these are, in some respects, and I don't mean to be absolutely unambiguously critical, but they're typical technological solutions to things.

29:40.310 --> 29:45.437
These are typical technological solutions to things.

29:46.298 --> 29:52.186
Mass solutions as opposed to careful solutions.

29:52.226 --> 29:59.415
In other words, you microfilm something for the purpose of preserving it, theoretically.

29:59.515 --> 30:00.497
Preserving the content.

30:00.697 --> 30:01.778
Preserving the content.

30:02.540 --> 30:08.207
But also the argument is made is microfilm so that the original does not have to be used.

30:08.609 --> 30:09.971
That's another sidebar.

30:09.991 --> 30:13.977
Yeah, but here at LC, you microfilm newspapers and dispose of the newspapers.

30:14.017 --> 30:14.858
Correct.

30:14.878 --> 30:16.281
Newspapers are a separate category.

30:16.301 --> 30:17.422
I'm thinking of printed books.

30:17.623 --> 30:19.806
Okay, but I'm just making a point.

30:19.826 --> 30:20.086
Yeah.

30:21.128 --> 30:25.815
And then, but of course, many times in the course of having to microfilm something, you have to take it apart.

30:25.835 --> 30:27.437
You can't use it.

30:27.938 --> 30:29.541
You can't microfilm it full.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.545
And the same to scan books digitally.

30:32.565 --> 30:35.730
I was up at Cornell last year, and they took me into this room.

30:36.149 --> 30:38.152
You know, these books look like veal cutlets.

30:38.232 --> 30:45.544
I mean, they were stripped and sliced and diced and ready to... This is more immediate, and this is something that's being faced.

30:45.564 --> 31:02.292
I mean, the technology presses us into decisions which are not necessarily, and I'm not in agreement with the people who are making these decisions, and they know that, they still really work here, are not necessarily to the best interests of the material.

31:03.655 --> 31:15.354
I mean, we have gone through a lot of work preparing the digital program for dealing with the physical stresses that those, the digitization is going to create.

31:15.394 --> 31:18.198
Because, of course, it's never considered, oh, just digitize, it's fine.

31:18.599 --> 31:19.821
Well, you can't digitize everything.

31:19.841 --> 31:21.664
You can't open it wide enough to get...
