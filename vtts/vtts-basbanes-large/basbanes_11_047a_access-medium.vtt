WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:23.728
Yes, what I have been saying is that in our case, special collections don't include the rare books.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.335
The rare books will go to Tolbiac with all the books.

00:29.657 --> 00:31.860
They will be kept in a special place

00:32.431 --> 00:36.458
for rare books, just as they are kept here.

00:37.299 --> 00:40.124
But all of them will be in Tolbiac.

00:40.865 --> 00:42.989
And here you'll find manuscripts.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.575
The manuscripts will stay here?

00:46.675 --> 00:47.597
Yes, of course.

00:47.797 --> 00:56.953
All the manuscripts, the engravings and photos, maps, music scores,

00:58.165 --> 01:06.192
the, how do you say, medals, money, and antics.

01:08.374 --> 01:15.500
And we gather here all the collections relating to performing arts too.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.704
We'll open a very great department for performing arts.

01:19.724 --> 01:20.204
Really?

01:20.224 --> 01:20.444
Yes.

01:21.065 --> 01:27.210
Already we have many collections about them, but they are not here, they are spread

01:27.545 --> 01:30.650
among different places.

01:31.591 --> 01:36.479
May I ask, what is the difference between special collections and rare books?

01:36.579 --> 01:39.945
In the United States, special collections are rare books.

01:40.686 --> 01:41.928
Are they different here?

01:41.948 --> 01:42.348
Are they different?

01:42.929 --> 01:49.460
Well, it was not a French word, if you want.

01:50.361 --> 01:54.868
And when we had to define

01:55.135 --> 02:00.263
to find a name for all the collection which will remain here.

02:03.087 --> 02:24.298
We thought to it and finally we agreed to give the name of special collections because this collection here, which will remain in Richelieu, include manuscripts.

02:25.392 --> 02:40.108
include music scores, include maps, and in many Anglo-Saxon libraries, under the word special collections, you find rare books, yes, but you find two manuscripts, maps, and music scores.

02:41.470 --> 02:52.522
Here, what is exceptional, and more scarce in, generally, in the national libraries, are two departments.

02:53.082 --> 02:54.724
One is our prints,

02:55.379 --> 03:04.512
engravings and photo departments because in many countries you find it in museums and not in libraries.

03:05.633 --> 03:10.881
And the second one is the ones for the medals, coins and antics.

03:11.742 --> 03:13.785
I don't know, you say antics or antics?

03:13.805 --> 03:14.786
Antics, yes.

03:14.927 --> 03:15.327
Antics.

03:16.208 --> 03:19.513
So, but both of them, the engravings

03:20.270 --> 03:28.218
and the coins and medals department are two of the most ancient departments of our library.

03:29.198 --> 03:48.657
They were founded in 1720 and at that time, before 1720, all the things, the books, the two objects belonging to the king

03:49.126 --> 04:18.610
were gathered together and and there was there were not several departments and for the first time for the first time in 1720 the library all the collections the royal collections were organized in five departments one of course one was the manuscripts department and there were second ones

04:18.860 --> 04:27.609
for what we call genealogies and titles.

04:28.009 --> 04:33.435
Now they are both together under the name of manuscript department.

04:34.996 --> 04:39.201
Well, another department was the books department of course.

04:40.662 --> 04:43.765
Another one was the engravings.

04:45.167 --> 04:48.630
And the last one, the Mendels and Collins.

04:49.927 --> 05:04.970
Is Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal being brought into the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal?

05:04.990 --> 05:18.330
Yes, I have not pronounced till now the name of Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal but of course actually last year our government has decided

05:18.732 --> 05:27.159
to gather all of that, to bring all the collections of Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal into Richelieu.

05:28.480 --> 05:47.777
So when we'll have place, when all the books and periodicals will be transferred, are transferred in Tolbiac, at that time, here, not only will gather all the performing arts collection, but

05:48.213 --> 05:54.642
two will carry here the collections of Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal.

05:54.762 --> 05:59.709
But that's causing some problems, some people are very unhappy about that, I understand that.

05:59.729 --> 06:08.280
That's true, you're right, because they have a very very pleasant reading room, that's true.

06:09.341 --> 06:14.929
The reading room with 48 seats, so it is

06:15.247 --> 06:29.308
small reading room and the people find very well in this reading room and that this room smells ancient time, I don't know how to tell it.

06:29.468 --> 06:33.193
The ambiance I guess of that particular building.

06:34.155 --> 06:40.444
Otherwise the building was not built to be a library, we must know that.

06:40.464 --> 06:44.410
It has been built to be flat apartments.

06:45.014 --> 06:49.140
And so what people see today, where are the radio rooms?

06:49.780 --> 06:52.885
Are the noble, is, excuse me, the noble flat.

06:53.686 --> 07:01.536
That means all the salons, the nice rooms, rooms for receptions, if you want.

07:02.658 --> 07:07.945
But when you see the upper stages, it is not exactly the same.

07:08.065 --> 07:10.068
And it's not good for books.

07:10.088 --> 07:14.734
And the important thing is you're trying to... No, we believe in taking care of the books.

07:14.866 --> 07:40.637
of course and that's what we say and today if oh we don't know what can happen but if ever political decision changes we are convinced today that we'll have a lot of public works to do upon the building otherwise

07:41.731 --> 07:46.639
It will be very dangerous for collections, but too for people.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.267
In this building, you're keeping the manuscripts?

07:52.729 --> 07:53.230
Here, yes.

07:53.611 --> 07:55.574
The very old ones, the ancient ones?

07:55.594 --> 07:57.557
Yes, the old and the recent ones.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.123
But how about the conditions here for maintaining them?

08:01.390 --> 08:30.773
the manuscripts wouldn't that wouldn't the newer building be better equipped to handle that certainly you're right of course because at the time we had not the same standards as we have today of course and some stages of the stores of course of the stacks are not so good for conservation but when

08:31.748 --> 08:38.258
At the time, all the books and periodicals collection will be transferred to Tzolbiak.

08:38.278 --> 08:49.594
At this time, we'll begin public works here too, in order to give more place to the actual departments.

08:52.519 --> 09:01.452
Places for collections, but place for the staff, because many of them have no offices.

09:01.516 --> 09:14.936
Yes, place for technical rooms where the, come on the magazine, it's not the keepers, but people who work upon collections.

09:14.956 --> 09:16.958
Curators, curators.

09:17.199 --> 09:20.524
But at the low level, if you want.

09:20.664 --> 09:21.365
Custodians.

09:21.625 --> 09:28.195
Yes, custodians can work and can prepare or repair the collections.

09:28.255 --> 09:29.717
Yes, we need that.

09:30.119 --> 09:34.363
And we need to more place for readers.

09:34.383 --> 09:48.839
More seats at first, and secondly, place bigger than the actual places, because today, readers come with their machines, with their computers, when I say that.

09:48.859 --> 09:57.888
Do you work at all, Madame Schillinger, with digitization, the scanning into computers of manuscripts and all?

09:57.908 --> 09:58.849
We have started.

09:59.670 --> 09:59.890
No.

10:00.241 --> 10:03.525
If you want, it is not a general step to work like that.

10:03.766 --> 10:10.374
But we have now a program of scamming.

10:10.394 --> 10:23.992
And I have, besides me, but now he's on holidays, a curator who is in charge of the digitization here.

10:24.953 --> 10:25.894
And so,

10:26.077 --> 10:55.746
As in my direction, we have many different kinds of documents, different formats, by the dimensions, by... So you have to choose

10:56.182 --> 11:25.108
different definitions for instance for the digitalizations and yes so he he works with our automation department direction it is a direction in order to make the good choice

11:25.342 --> 11:54.488
and actually we have about 11 programs of digitization not all for manuscripts we have yes two programs for manuscripts and it is illuminated manuscripts yes illuminated manuscripts not yet the literary manuscripts we would like very much we know that it is more difficult and we must

11:54.873 --> 11:57.336
think exactly what we want for that.

11:59.279 --> 12:09.413
We have two programs of digitalization for engravings, for photos, for maps.

12:09.433 --> 12:15.661
No, we haven't chosen music scores in the music department.

12:16.322 --> 12:21.048
We have chosen iconography of musicians.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.732
Do you expect that

12:24.067 --> 12:29.594
at some point the scholars will be working from the digitized copies?

12:30.315 --> 12:34.140
Or do you still expect to allow the scholar to use the original?

12:35.002 --> 12:35.242
No.

12:37.244 --> 12:37.405
Ah!

12:38.967 --> 12:40.769
Yes.

12:40.789 --> 12:42.071
Different cases, of course.

12:42.592 --> 12:44.754
You cannot have just one approach.

12:45.115 --> 12:47.598
It is impossible.

12:48.379 --> 12:53.466
Among the criteria to choose the documents to scan,

12:54.357 --> 12:55.338
What to have done?

12:56.099 --> 12:56.880
We have several.

12:58.822 --> 13:13.199
For instance, we can choose the documents the most consulted by readers, requested by readers.

13:14.581 --> 13:24.212
We can choose them because they are getting brittle.

13:25.154 --> 13:47.481
and documents which interest the public the most.

13:49.303 --> 13:53.929
We have to do with these criteria, of course.

13:54.500 --> 14:07.354
If the originals are coming brittle, of course, we give at first to readers the digitized form.

14:08.175 --> 14:08.356
The copy.

14:08.376 --> 14:10.418
The copy.

14:10.438 --> 14:23.933
And it is only if we receive a very hard researcher who needs to see really the original that we give to him

14:24.082 --> 14:26.245
the original, otherwise never.

14:26.545 --> 14:29.109
If he wants to see the color of the ink, for instance.

14:29.129 --> 14:36.459
For instance, yes, or the paper, sometimes, and the water mark, of course.

14:36.859 --> 14:39.403
Or if there are any annotations marks.

14:39.843 --> 14:40.084
Yes, yes.

14:40.204 --> 14:53.582
But if it's just content, if it's just... Then why does one have to... But already we do that with the photos, because the microphones, microfiche, of course, already.

14:53.917 --> 15:07.434
Actually, in our manuscript department, many readers, when they come, if they ask documents already reproduced, will give them at first the microphones.

15:07.454 --> 15:13.902
And if it is only if they have good reasons to see the originate, they will give the originate.

15:13.922 --> 15:14.683
Otherwise, no.

15:15.524 --> 15:19.249
Sometimes it is discussion, a hard discussion with them, you know.

15:19.617 --> 15:22.360
Do you know Roger Stoddard at Harvard University?

15:22.400 --> 15:25.723
Mr. Stoddard, who's the head of the Houghton Library, rare books.

15:25.963 --> 15:26.323
Yes.

15:26.864 --> 15:37.073
But he contends that there are some manuscripts that only have one use left, perhaps, that if you go through it once or twice, it will fall apart.

15:37.574 --> 15:44.300
And he has things that he says, maybe we have to copy them, and then we'll have a copy, and that's the only one you'll ever use.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.622
So then that happens, I guess.

15:46.642 --> 15:47.423
How about acquisition?

15:47.443 --> 15:47.683
That's true.

15:48.068 --> 15:56.801
A policy of acquisitions, are you still acquiring material as aggressively as you have in the past?

15:56.821 --> 15:57.061
Well.

15:57.301 --> 16:00.626
Maybe you could just discuss the policy of the French Library on that.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.369
Well, policy.

16:02.569 --> 16:17.350
It depends, of course, if it is manuscript, unica, or if you speak of printed documents, of course, engraving, yes, like engraving.

16:18.258 --> 16:27.186
You know that our library has the legal deposit since 1527.

16:27.947 --> 16:28.147
Wow.

16:28.167 --> 16:28.327
No.

16:28.347 --> 16:28.588
1537.

16:28.608 --> 16:29.108
1537.

16:29.128 --> 16:31.630
1537.

16:32.912 --> 16:33.072
Yes.

16:33.092 --> 16:36.735
1537.

16:37.336 --> 16:40.098
And of the king's Francois Ier.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.300
He has decided.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.783
And so we still have it.

16:45.183 --> 16:46.324
And we have it for

16:46.996 --> 16:54.523
for all the printed documents distributed to one public.

16:57.005 --> 17:10.577
So books, periodicals, engravings, photos too, music scores, maps of course, and audiovisual documents.

17:11.338 --> 17:16.783
That means phonograms, videograms, multimedia.

17:17.911 --> 17:31.025
And since 1992, now, we have legal deposit for electronic documents when they are printed upon a disc.

17:31.325 --> 17:32.246
Really?

17:32.266 --> 17:34.088
Or Progiciel.

17:34.869 --> 17:36.170
How do you see it?

17:36.431 --> 17:39.554
No, Progiciel, it is commercial softwares.

17:39.894 --> 17:41.035
Oh, yes.

17:41.055 --> 17:42.277
Very interesting.

17:42.297 --> 17:46.281
We have legal deposit for all these kinds of documents.

17:47.358 --> 18:16.977
yes it is so we for today the development of the collection is based upon legal deposit when we have it for them and purchases gifts legacies of course exchanges too yes with foreign libraries or institutions not only libraries

18:17.227 --> 18:22.673
Mr. Scheide in the United States did an exchange with Bibliotech National.

18:22.893 --> 18:26.096
One book, he got the 1457-month Psalter.

18:26.837 --> 18:29.120
You had a duplicate copy, so he did an exchange.

18:29.280 --> 18:35.386
Yes, yes, because we get several copies from the legal deposit.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.107
Yes.

18:36.127 --> 18:42.073
Your focus, of course, is now the Library of Congress does every nation in the world.

18:42.093 --> 18:42.694
It tries to.

18:42.843 --> 18:45.366
No, we don't want to.

18:45.386 --> 18:50.291
The British Library tries also to do outside of Great Britain.

18:50.331 --> 18:50.511
No.

18:50.531 --> 18:52.493
But you are primarily French.

18:53.214 --> 18:53.875
Primarily.

18:54.235 --> 18:57.198
And already it's the art we think.

18:57.278 --> 18:57.679
We think.

18:58.399 --> 18:59.721
Primarily, of course.

19:00.321 --> 19:00.702
French.

19:01.483 --> 19:07.309
After that I can say francophony for books, for instance, and periodicals.

19:08.330 --> 19:08.850
Naturally.

19:09.551 --> 19:11.533
And as all the

19:11.615 --> 19:35.395
great research libraries we purchase to get them by exchange well we acquire let us say acquire we acquire two foreign documents in order to have what we call reference collections in for all kinds of documents so we acquire

19:36.708 --> 19:47.840
foreign engravings, foreign photos, foreign maps coming from USA, from Japan, from Russia, from Denmark, I don't know, from all over the world.

19:47.860 --> 19:51.504
Of course, in all French parts, in translation too.

19:51.524 --> 20:02.115
Yes, but what we try is to get, of course, the best of the productions of a high level, research level, and that's one condition.

20:03.677 --> 20:06.580
And a selection, of course,

20:07.707 --> 20:15.194
in order to give an idea of the production in one country at the same time as in our country.

20:18.277 --> 20:19.758
And for the past.

20:20.659 --> 20:27.966
And it is a case, for instance, for our oriental division of the manuscript departments.

20:29.107 --> 20:37.275
They have fabulous collections since the 16th century.

20:38.082 --> 20:41.186
16th, 17th century, 17th century.

20:43.008 --> 20:52.761
And very early, they got Arabic, Hebraic, Turkish, I don't know, Chinese, Japanese documents.

20:55.465 --> 21:00.211
And it is known, they are well known all around the world.

21:00.852 --> 21:07.701
So when today we have the occasion

21:08.221 --> 21:19.541
to purchase, generally it is by purchase, to buy a document complementary of the collection, we do it.

21:20.282 --> 21:26.213
But only in this case.

21:26.581 --> 21:32.808
Do you still have an adequate budget for purchase of the new material?

21:32.828 --> 21:34.049
I know we see it all over the world.

21:34.569 --> 21:40.355
Everywhere you'll hear librarians telling you, no, it is not enough.

21:40.776 --> 21:44.740
Well, I think we must be reasonably sometime.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.463
We can say it's rather good budget.

21:47.483 --> 21:49.225
Let us say rather good.

21:50.046 --> 21:55.631
But it is impossible with such a budget, which is limited.

21:55.992 --> 21:56.132
Yes.

21:56.804 --> 22:02.632
For instance, I can give you an idea, if you want, for my direction.

22:02.652 --> 22:14.547
So, for the seven departments I have in my direction, manuscripts, engravings, maps, music scores, performing arts, medals, coins, and arsenal, seven.

22:15.369 --> 22:18.653
Well, I have seven millions by year.

22:19.334 --> 22:20.235
Seven millions.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.700
By year for the special collections.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.562
That means that I have

22:25.913 --> 22:35.986
another budget for buying books, for reference books, in order to be able to work upon these documents.

22:37.107 --> 22:42.474
Well, although for really the special documents, I have about 7 million.

22:43.315 --> 22:47.540
And we're saying francs, of course, francs, French francs.

22:47.560 --> 22:55.110
Well, it is far not enough.

22:56.643 --> 23:19.190
And last year, for instance, we had the occasions to buy very, very rare collections of contemporary manuscripts by René Chard, the French poet, and illuminated by very famous artists, painters, French painters.

23:19.210 --> 23:22.274
And this money was not enough.

23:23.555 --> 23:26.599
It was about 11 millions only.

23:27.035 --> 23:28.537
what to do.

23:29.958 --> 23:37.466
So when such an occasion happens, we have to ask for more money from our ministry.

23:38.807 --> 23:44.213
And sometimes we have a good answer, but sometimes not.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.314
What happened in this case?

23:46.175 --> 23:46.995
It was a good one.

23:49.578 --> 23:51.120
But it is not always the case.

23:51.540 --> 23:56.485
And we see very often French documents

23:56.650 --> 24:19.731
really patrimonial documents that we would like very much to keep here in the country, sold to the great countries, buying French documents across the United States or France, but we don't know after that if they stay in Switzerland.

24:20.792 --> 24:21.973
And Japan.

24:24.876 --> 24:25.797
Could you define

24:26.030 --> 24:29.534
Patrimony for me, that is a word I see often.

24:30.476 --> 24:37.044
Patrimony for us is a document very important for the history of the country.

24:38.746 --> 24:48.038
That means document produced in the country, or relating to the story of the country.

24:51.583 --> 24:55.648
For instance, documents relating to Ballets Russes,

24:56.320 --> 25:00.366
all this period, a very famous period for ballots.

25:01.227 --> 25:04.612
Well, you can't say really it is a French document.

25:04.872 --> 25:11.761
No, but there are very straight relations with the history of the French ballot.

25:12.943 --> 25:17.810
So, we consider it is a patrimonial document.

25:17.890 --> 25:25.821
And recently, we barred like that and, comment on this, and prevent

25:26.155 --> 25:35.503
outside the country of a music score of Stravinsky.

25:38.846 --> 25:43.010
Because we consider that it was a patrimony document.

25:43.830 --> 25:56.061
And it can be considered as a patrimony for its historical, artistic, literary, archaeological interest.

25:58.066 --> 26:27.988
for all these reasons scientific too history for instance manuscripts of Pasteur of Marie Curie and we have them here that's why I give this example is this a legal document defining patrimony that is very interesting defining patrimony not exactly but we have a decree yes about the how to go

26:28.441 --> 26:54.246
outside the country export export yes we have yes and it is at the origin no we had many years ago already a French law about that but now we have a new law inspired by the European legislation

26:54.850 --> 27:15.134
And this new law has been taken at the end of 1992 and gives, if you want, but it's very short, some definition about these kinds of documents forbidden from exportation, of exportation.

27:15.154 --> 27:22.062
Do you see this as a concern with all of the countries of Europe becoming like a united Europe?

27:22.082 --> 27:23.524
No, no, no.

27:23.605 --> 27:31.373
All of us, each of us, we have our culture and we have different patrimony.

27:31.954 --> 27:40.042
And the richness of the different European countries is not the same by history.

27:42.045 --> 27:50.233
Generally, the Mediterranean countries are richer than the northern countries of Europe.

27:51.154 --> 27:51.414
Richer?

27:51.434 --> 27:51.975
Is that the way you use it?

27:52.580 --> 27:55.763
That means Italy, Spain, France.

27:57.424 --> 28:11.077
And that is in difficulty because when we discuss about new legislation, we have not the same feeling and the same reaction because of that.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.660
I see.

28:13.680 --> 28:20.646
But would you also say then that with this united Europe, for want is a better phrase,

28:21.200 --> 28:25.986
it is more important than ever for the National Library to preserve the patrimony.

28:26.006 --> 28:26.467
Of course.

28:27.188 --> 28:28.670
Yes, I think it is.

28:30.052 --> 28:30.793
We have to do it.

28:31.234 --> 28:46.754
And in the European legislation, if you want, try to fix the same regulations for the culture.

28:46.774 --> 28:49.418
But they have written, too,

28:50.073 --> 29:01.425
that they will do all they can do to protect the individual culture of each country.

29:01.445 --> 29:06.110
Did you have a question?

29:06.130 --> 29:12.837
It just means that there are many, many collections that we have now.

29:14.138 --> 29:14.559
Do you have one?

29:14.939 --> 29:17.582
No, not enough now.

29:18.119 --> 29:23.826
You are right, actually, just at the point where we are not enough rooms.

29:27.290 --> 29:37.602
And that's why we really were waiting for the departure of the books collection to Talbiage, because we need the space.

29:38.684 --> 29:43.249
We need them very strongly.

29:43.702 --> 30:02.523
Is there, of course, this is probably your area and other people I'll talk to tomorrow might be able to comment on this, but is there any discussion on, we were talking earlier about computerization and digitization, of deaccessioning certain books once they've been put onto computers?

30:02.543 --> 30:07.549
In other words, getting rid of certain books once they have gone into a computer format?

30:08.322 --> 30:10.725
I have not well understood your question.

30:10.745 --> 30:11.606
Excuse me.

30:11.847 --> 30:15.031
Let's say you computerize, digitize a book.

30:15.051 --> 30:15.492
Yes.

30:15.512 --> 30:16.873
You now have it on a computer.

30:16.893 --> 30:20.458
Do you get rid of the physical object?

30:20.478 --> 30:22.481
Do you keep the... Yes, we keep.

30:22.601 --> 30:22.741
Yes.

30:23.102 --> 30:24.484
Oh, yes, we keep.

30:26.827 --> 30:27.307
We keep.

30:27.528 --> 30:33.676
And till now, we keep it in the collections here in the library.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.760
Because with Tolbiac...

30:37.297 --> 31:05.835
at the same time has been built just a little outside from Paris another building just square buildings with stacks to keep one what we call one security collection which must be not given to readers only to be kept

31:06.608 --> 31:08.089
storage, only storage.

31:08.950 --> 31:20.321
Well, and in the case you are talking about, no, we don't want to put the book in this stack, not now.

31:21.302 --> 31:21.942
We'll see.

31:22.483 --> 31:26.547
Perhaps in 10, 20 years, it is too new, too recent.

31:27.427 --> 31:31.972
We don't know exactly today how the readers will work with that.

31:34.014 --> 31:35.535
We have to wait a little.

31:36.680 --> 31:45.472
The French library is really doing very impressive things on the internet, from my home.

31:45.492 --> 31:46.613
Yes, you've seen.

31:46.714 --> 31:48.876
And the manuscripts?

31:48.917 --> 31:49.317
No?

31:49.457 --> 31:50.759
I haven't gone to the manuscript.

31:50.779 --> 31:53.122
No, no, but open internet.

31:53.142 --> 32:03.396
It's a very short program about the king, Charles V, not V.

32:04.085 --> 32:10.215
You expect at some point to have all of that available on the internet access, the cataloging.

32:10.415 --> 32:18.288
Yes, the two great databases of the library now are available open internet, yes.

32:18.569 --> 32:29.687
Which is, do you see at some point, and this is just a question of your own feeling, do you see the printed book, the book remaining into the 21st century?

32:30.005 --> 32:31.047
Yes, of course.

32:31.347 --> 32:32.429
Do you see it being replaced?

32:32.449 --> 32:34.572
I am sure that they will remain.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.195
We need them, all of us.

32:38.457 --> 32:44.406
You have not the same approach, the same kind of reading with a book.

32:46.389 --> 32:53.399
With a book, you can go like that, you can do that, you can work up on several pages.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.160
Yes, you can.

32:54.461 --> 32:55.602
It is not the same manner.

32:56.223 --> 32:59.488
It is a linear, very often, reading.

32:59.958 --> 33:03.922
open the computer.

33:03.942 --> 33:07.146
It is not the same with a book or several books.

33:08.387 --> 33:12.652
I think you have a larger view when you have original.

33:13.112 --> 33:19.359
It depends exactly what kind of research you do, what is your work.

33:19.940 --> 33:23.704
Sometimes for your work you don't need to have a book.

33:25.270 --> 33:52.763
or the manuscript or book and manuscript etc but sometimes really you need to have them and if you have just to see some pages of the book an article for instance well perhaps you can read it on computer when you have to read a whole book on computer

33:53.603 --> 33:56.366
I don't know if you resist, but I can't.

33:56.726 --> 34:03.693
I don't know anyone who has ever read a book on a computer.

34:03.713 --> 34:03.833
No.

34:04.033 --> 34:12.562
Well, computers have many qualities, and we have seen it with engravings, for instance, or illuminates.

34:14.884 --> 34:15.144
Why?

34:15.925 --> 34:19.729
Because you see perhaps better the image.

34:20.873 --> 34:28.242
You can get it bigger and see better the details.

34:30.225 --> 34:35.231
You can see only one detail in great size, etc.

34:35.751 --> 34:39.876
Well, it's a new kind of lecture, of view.

34:40.778 --> 34:41.639
It is interesting.

34:42.119 --> 34:44.362
It's a tool for studying, for closer studying.

34:44.382 --> 34:49.328
Yes, but you cannot see it only like that.

34:49.865 --> 35:07.140
or the outside, the complete page or the complete presentation, because I think that really the work of a creator, it is not only the information, it is more that information.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.002
Do you have an email address?

35:09.022 --> 35:10.904
Do you use email?

35:10.924 --> 35:11.004
Yes.

35:11.024 --> 35:12.165
I'm going to give you my card.

35:12.185 --> 35:17.830
Because I haven't it up on my card.

35:20.189 --> 35:21.411
Here's my card here.

35:21.451 --> 35:22.412
I'll leave with you.

35:23.414 --> 35:24.275
I know you're busy.

35:24.335 --> 35:29.703
I would like, if possible, to contact you again at some time, if you don't mind.

35:29.723 --> 35:39.537
When I try to grab this tape and... Did you have any questions?

35:39.557 --> 35:43.482
Could you give me an idea of the numbers of manuscripts?

35:43.723 --> 35:47.268
Just give us an idea of the size of the collections you supervise.

35:47.588 --> 35:48.930
I will give you more than that.

35:49.535 --> 35:55.764
I tried to give you a collection.

35:55.784 --> 35:57.386
Oh, excellent.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.048
Do you know Mr. Carlton Lake?

36:01.171 --> 36:01.271
No.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.394
At the University of Texas.

36:05.838 --> 36:11.285
No, last year I visited the Getty.

36:11.305 --> 36:11.546
Oh.

36:11.826 --> 36:16.032
And I went to the Huntington Library and I was very

36:16.518 --> 36:25.069
I used to see them, and I saw some new libraries in San Francisco or Los Angeles.

36:25.089 --> 36:26.211
So different.

36:26.231 --> 36:26.591
Really?

36:28.614 --> 36:33.661
So what do you think of the new libraries of today?

36:33.861 --> 36:45.917
Well, I think, of course, it is a concept more, comment on the, comfortable for the readers, of course.

36:46.792 --> 36:57.969
everything is, is much better organized around them.

36:59.111 --> 37:08.326
As I told you, for instance, the size of the table to work, and all the reference books around the reading room.

37:08.766 --> 37:12.512
You have computers, if you want, if you need, you can.

37:12.644 --> 37:41.402
access to the databases many things like that and well architecture too and light from the daylight if you want is better assured well this one is an old I can't give it to you but I think I can give you this

37:41.821 --> 37:42.983
collection.

37:44.004 --> 37:46.988
So you'll find performing arts maps, engravings.

37:48.089 --> 37:53.376
Our manuscript department is divided in two parts.

37:53.977 --> 37:57.962
One occidental and the other oriental manuscript.

37:57.982 --> 37:59.744
But it is the same department.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.569
And this one is for coins and mills.

38:04.270 --> 38:10.258
But I haven't yet the new one and it is my last

38:10.711 --> 38:14.035
That's why I keep it for the music scores.

38:14.796 --> 38:19.442
And I have not two, the one for Arsenal.

38:19.462 --> 38:21.805
That's great.

38:22.126 --> 38:30.657
And you'll find some numbers and the volumes of the collections, you'll find it.

38:31.117 --> 38:34.862
So you will be staying here, you will not be moving to the new building?

38:35.483 --> 38:35.723
No, no.

38:36.631 --> 38:58.344
All the special collections will stay here and will share this building with the library of the Institut National for Histoire de l'Art, National Institute for History of Art.

38:59.065 --> 39:00.567
It will be a new creation.

39:00.787 --> 39:04.613
It is not yet created.

39:05.690 --> 39:11.378
So they will have the library here in some part of this building.

39:11.398 --> 39:16.846
Of course, will be the main... Tenant.

39:17.587 --> 39:17.988
Tenant.

39:18.248 --> 39:18.669
Thank you.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.452
Tenant of the building.

39:21.193 --> 39:24.578
But they will have a part.

39:26.000 --> 39:26.200
Oui?

39:27.121 --> 39:34.532
I think we've used enough of that.

39:35.052 --> 39:39.918
Well, if you need some more information, something, I can give it to you.

39:39.998 --> 39:42.521
Just you send me your questions.

39:43.482 --> 39:43.902
Yes, merci.

39:44.583 --> 39:48.528
And so you work... I'm writing a book.

39:48.548 --> 39:50.790
Want me to write the name of my book on there?

39:51.331 --> 39:54.494
Yes, I have in the... Oh, okay, yes.

39:54.555 --> 39:59.961
In the letter, because Thierry Grier gave it to me.

40:00.101 --> 40:03.625
We'll see him tomorrow, and we'll go over to Tobia tomorrow.

40:03.959 --> 40:06.964
I'm going to go see Monsieur Beret's Filet Beret right now.

40:07.084 --> 40:08.026
So interesting.

40:08.247 --> 40:13.436
I hope for you that he will show you some very rare documents, too.

40:15.720 --> 40:21.630
We're due there at four o'clock, so that's... You're going to give me your card, too.
