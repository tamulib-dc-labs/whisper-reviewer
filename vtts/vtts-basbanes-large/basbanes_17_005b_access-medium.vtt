00:02.107 --> 00:03.649
So thanks.

00:03.849 --> 00:06.091
Thank you very much for that wonderful call.

00:06.151 --> 00:10.275
It's interesting that my 11-year-old daughter just finished reading.

00:10.315 --> 00:19.885
It took her about a month or six weeks, but she just finished reading Little Women, and she would not allow herself to watch the video of that wonderful movie until she'd finished it.

00:19.925 --> 00:23.108
And she said, Dad, 476 pages.

00:23.128 --> 00:24.950
She said, it's the longest book I've ever read.

00:24.990 --> 00:30.155
I said, honey, I think that's a bigger book than many people, adults, have read.

00:30.556 --> 00:30.696
Mm-hmm.

00:31.013 --> 00:31.754
I'm very proud of her.

00:31.774 --> 00:39.325
But moving books, I think, has to be the most difficult, the most formidable thing that anybody could be faced with.

00:39.826 --> 00:41.588
Gene, you mentioned earlier the weight of the books.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.170
I mean, it's awesome.

00:43.250 --> 00:59.113
I think when you think of how many boxes it might take to fill a library of 5,000 books or even 1,500 books, Stephen Blumberg, the book thief, when they seized his books, 23,000, it was something like 879 books.

00:59.566 --> 01:02.593
packing crates, 17 FBI agents.

01:02.613 --> 01:05.941
It took them two days to remove these books from that house.

01:05.961 --> 01:11.074
So what this woman has just described, moving often with a lot of books, it's not an easy thing to do.

01:12.277 --> 01:17.389
Is that part of what makes it seem so precious, the fact that it's so substantial?

01:17.993 --> 01:21.057
Well, in terms of bulk, I don't know.

01:21.578 --> 01:25.423
Volume, weight, density.

01:25.783 --> 01:28.727
It makes you think twice before you decide to move, though, that's for sure.

01:29.768 --> 01:33.694
Do women make more frequent collectors than men?

01:35.055 --> 01:37.519
Historically, it's been the other way around.

01:37.619 --> 01:45.489
In fact, there have been some very foolish observations that women never had the bug at all.

01:45.509 --> 01:46.971
I totally...

01:47.322 --> 01:49.044
disprove that in my book.

01:49.885 --> 01:56.454
And I think one of the reasons they haven't collected with the same frequency is men are for the reasons that are obvious.

01:56.474 --> 01:57.576
I mean, they never had the means.

01:58.457 --> 02:05.586
One woman says, you know, having been considered possessions ourselves, I mean, so I don't want to get into this, but it's a valid argument.

02:05.626 --> 02:12.516
How could they possibly collect when they didn't have the means or the wherewithal or not even considered intelligence enough to do it?

02:12.576 --> 02:12.756
I mean,

02:12.888 --> 02:16.012
And not, in many cases, even permitted to become literate.

02:16.032 --> 02:16.552
Exactly.

02:16.853 --> 02:21.858
We're not even allowed to read or go to school.

02:21.878 --> 02:34.373
But I think that when you get by that, you find that, well, Louise Taper, the woman I write about out in California, who has undeniably the world's greatest collection of Lincoln material,

02:34.893 --> 02:51.228
she's fortunate, she has the means to indulge this fascination for Lincoln, but boy, once she's into it, I mean, she's as tenacious and aggressive and acquisitive as any male you're likely to see, and probably even more successful.

02:51.328 --> 02:52.429
Well, she is more successful.

02:52.490 --> 02:55.993
It's a great collection of Lincoln material in private hands now.

02:56.914 --> 02:57.975
Green Bay, go ahead.

02:58.415 --> 03:01.558
Yes, it's sort of like a side issue regarding your books.

03:02.129 --> 03:14.067
I don't know if any of you have ever been to Concord, Massachusetts, but one of the prettiest cemeteries, I think, in this country is the cemetery in Concord called Sleepy Hollow.

03:14.908 --> 03:18.934
And in the back of the cemetery is an area called Writer's Ridge.

03:20.196 --> 03:29.269
And on that ridge, or it's an uplifting area of land, you just feel like you sort of walk back into a solemn time of writers.

03:30.391 --> 03:31.933
There you'll find Thoreau.

03:32.420 --> 03:39.047
this family, Emerson, Walcott, all the great transcendental writers.

03:39.908 --> 03:40.929
All in the same cemetery?

03:40.969 --> 03:46.835
And they're all, it's on Writers' Ridge, and you have to sort of sneak around until you find them, unless you know where it is.

03:47.576 --> 03:54.583
And also, oh, there's a great early writer, Hawthorne, as I said, Emerson, Thoreau, Walcott.

03:54.603 --> 03:57.827
There's a number of others there, and they're all buried in the same place with their families.

03:58.668 --> 04:00.870
And it's the most solemn place you've ever seen.

04:00.950 --> 04:01.971
It's just beautiful.

04:02.457 --> 04:10.627
I don't know if anybody can still be buried there, but, you know, people who like writings and that, and I certainly enjoy that.

04:11.568 --> 04:13.251
I have stacks of books in my house.

04:13.431 --> 04:14.813
I just stack them up.

04:14.993 --> 04:23.483
I ran out of space, so what I just do is I lay one on top of another, and that's where I leave them, and I don't put them in boxes.

04:23.503 --> 04:30.372
And sometimes something comes out, and you pull a book back out, and you go back through it, or you have people over here talking about a book,

04:30.672 --> 04:32.575
And you say, oh, yeah, and you go and get it.

04:33.336 --> 04:35.079
I just couldn't put books in boxes.

04:35.199 --> 04:38.144
I think that's perverse.

04:38.164 --> 04:38.725
It's interesting.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.311
Where I sit, I'm about 25 or so miles from Concord.

04:42.331 --> 04:54.050
And as I mentioned, when my daughter finished reading Little Women just a couple weeks ago, I promised her a day trip to Concord to visit these very same specific places the gentleman just mentioned.

04:54.070 --> 04:56.173
One of the great beauties of Concord is that it's

04:56.727 --> 05:00.111
It's very much the same way it was in the 19th century.

05:00.172 --> 05:02.354
Walden Pond is there.

05:02.374 --> 05:03.115
It's beautiful.

05:03.596 --> 05:09.243
The homes, the Emerson home, they're all just intact the way they were.

05:09.364 --> 05:10.605
It's a beautiful, beautiful place.

05:10.645 --> 05:18.816
And that cemetery really is an awesome, inspirational place to visit.

05:18.836 --> 05:19.217
Hello?

05:19.237 --> 05:19.877
Yeah.

05:20.078 --> 05:20.919
I didn't die.

05:21.099 --> 05:21.440
I'm sorry.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.764
I guess I should have put a period on there.

05:24.784 --> 05:24.844
No.

05:25.448 --> 05:26.830
Moved off to Riders Ridge.

05:28.031 --> 05:28.872
Madison, go ahead.

05:29.392 --> 05:29.793
Is that me?

05:30.453 --> 05:31.735
Yes.

05:32.055 --> 05:34.438
I have a question for your guest.

05:34.458 --> 05:38.422
I have about 1,000 books, and I had about 1,100.

05:38.462 --> 05:45.890
And as a result of moving, I went through the books and gave away about 100, which I knew I would never read again.

05:46.611 --> 05:54.780
My question is, the books that I kept, which I only realized much later, are history, geography, history,

05:55.132 --> 06:04.801
biographies, dictionaries, and most of them are either writings on philosophy or religion.

06:05.321 --> 06:09.265
And I was just wondering, does this indicate anything to your guest?

06:09.545 --> 06:10.586
Well, of course it does.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.669
It certainly indicates eclectic taste.

06:14.930 --> 06:22.877
In terms of rarity, again, let me please stress and restress, and to go back to that gentleman earlier who mentioned the 1852 primer,

06:23.549 --> 06:29.254
I am not an authority on what is valuable and what isn't, but I certainly have some sense.

06:29.855 --> 06:39.963
It sounds to me like what you're saying you have are a lot of textbooks, perhaps, which regrettably don't have any monetary value that I know of.

06:40.664 --> 06:45.068
However, there could be exceptions if they're very old and scarce.

06:46.349 --> 06:51.734
I would suggest with a thousand books, if they're old, you really didn't give any sense of how old they might be.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.235
Some of them are quite old.

06:53.468 --> 06:55.771
And I am not interested in getting rid of them.

06:56.271 --> 06:58.434
I don't care whether they're valuable or not.

06:58.474 --> 06:59.295
They're valuable to me.

06:59.315 --> 06:59.755
Well, there you go.

06:59.815 --> 07:01.958
That's the most important thing, in my view.

07:02.038 --> 07:04.240
The value is personal and not monetary.

07:06.002 --> 07:20.719
It sounds like if they're old, like 19th century books, it might just be a wonderful collection of books of how people were educated and what they read for pleasure and intellectual stimulation 50 or whatever, 100 years or so ago, if they're 19th century books.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.041
I love 19th century books.

07:22.628 --> 07:49.328
american books not just for the content but for the titles for the nice beautiful old american bindings of pictorial cloth gold guilt i just swoon when i see a beautiful old book and it doesn't even matter what the content is sometimes nicholas bezbanes with us talking about his gentle madness bibliophiles bibliomains and the eternal passion for books

07:50.894 --> 07:54.960
His own book bears that title and is beautiful.

07:55.821 --> 07:58.625
If you'd like to join us on the air, the number is 1-800-642-1234.

08:01.970 --> 08:05.135
In Madison or Milwaukee, 263-1890.

08:05.675 --> 08:08.319
This is the Ideas Network of Wisconsin Public Radio.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.561
I'm Jean Farocca.

08:13.237 --> 08:15.664
Something of value comes from our afternoon discussions.

08:16.005 --> 08:21.039
We hear many different points of view from our guests and our listeners, and we end each day a little more informed.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.342
I'm Kathleen Dunn.

08:22.403 --> 08:27.938
Join the talk from 3 until 5, weekday afternoons on the Ideas Network of Wisconsin Public Radio.

08:41.502 --> 08:45.407
From heartworm problems to special diets, find the answers to questions about your pets.

08:45.747 --> 08:49.471
Next hour, Larry Mueller will be talking with a veterinarian.

08:50.913 --> 08:52.815
Our next caller joins us from Phillips.

08:53.896 --> 09:10.716
Yes, I just wanted to say that my husband called about five minutes to 10 and said that I should turn on this program because he finally discovered the disease that was afflicting him, which he and I both collect...

09:10.983 --> 09:21.398
He is just an avid reader, and it seems like everywhere we go, if we travel somewhere, we collect books from that location.

09:21.458 --> 09:25.844
If we see a program on TV that interests us, we buy books.

09:26.164 --> 09:38.982
And I think the wonderful thing about it, in addition to just loving books, our children have always been able to come home and say, I have to do a report on this or so, and is there anything that we have...

09:39.046 --> 10:03.805
on that and almost invariably we can find it and uh my husband's cardinal rule is uh if you have the books you can do the research and um we we we all love books in fact our son has just gone to work at the new barns and noble bookstore in minneapolis which uh is you know we go over there and that's a day outing for us so i think uh this

10:04.325 --> 10:10.393
Your depth has just, I think, touched the soul of many people.

10:10.433 --> 10:11.735
My sentiments precisely.

10:11.775 --> 10:26.295
There are books that we will see or we'll want to get, and they may not interest me or my wife directly, but we'll say, well, perhaps one of the girls might be able to use this book in writing a paper or research.

10:26.676 --> 10:32.003
It's really wonderful, the resources that you have in your house, how you can assist their work.

10:32.202 --> 10:38.969
You know, this woman has touched on something that's very interesting, the fact that she collects books with her husband.

10:38.989 --> 10:41.071
Now, this can be really, truly wonderful.

10:41.371 --> 10:47.277
On the one hand, it can be synergistic where you can produce something that's greater than the sum of its parts.

10:47.698 --> 10:53.824
But on the other hand, you almost wonder if it isn't a good idea to have somebody who can hold you in check.

10:53.884 --> 11:02.192
I know in this household, my wife shares the passion, and we will go looking at yard sales or flea markets or

11:02.645 --> 11:06.269
second-hand bookstores, and I will see something that I absolutely have to have.

11:06.649 --> 11:09.913
It would be wonderful if there was something to say, are you crazy?

11:11.154 --> 11:12.395
Dare we afford this thing?

11:12.936 --> 11:22.446
But she will always, especially if it's beautiful illustrated books with engravings, she loves books on gardening and animals and that sort of thing.

11:22.546 --> 11:28.753
Invariably we'll wind up adding another book that we certainly probably don't need.

11:29.071 --> 11:35.340
to the library, but it is a great deal of fun to go out and gather books with people.

11:36.382 --> 11:40.848
Are you selective at all about what you love?

11:41.329 --> 11:57.492
I'm sorry, yes, and you have to be because, and I think I try to draw the distinction of the book between, the book is about collectors, it's not about accumulators, and there's the famous case of the Calder Brothers in New York City who back in the 1940s

11:57.944 --> 12:02.068
quite literally died under the weight of their own books and magazines.

12:02.689 --> 12:08.856
And when they cleaned this place out, there was 150 tons of what was considered to be junk.

12:08.876 --> 12:11.399
It probably mostly was, which went off to the dump.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.302
But there was no focus to anything that they had.

12:14.362 --> 12:16.464
So we don't really consider them collectors.

12:16.504 --> 12:17.986
We consider them accumulators.

12:19.187 --> 12:20.428
Yeah, there has to be a focus.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.993
There have to be things that are meaningful to you and that you want.

12:25.013 --> 12:26.635
And I think a true collector does...

12:26.969 --> 12:32.175
acquire the books that have meaning for them.

12:32.236 --> 12:35.713
I think that's the essence of collecting is discrimination and focus.

12:36.757 --> 12:40.181
Tell us a little bit about collection in history.

12:41.243 --> 12:50.114
The monks, for example, of the Middle Ages, who dedicated their lives to the preservation of manuscripts, and how we've benefited from that.

12:50.455 --> 13:00.989
And I'm thinking also of some of the precious books that were lost forever, like the poetry of Sappho, like so many of the plays of the Greek tragedians.

13:03.612 --> 13:05.194
Well, the monks, of course, we...

13:06.878 --> 13:08.780
we owe so much to them.

13:08.860 --> 13:35.046
I mean, the whole of classical literature that has survived can be traced to the fact that they grew up this, they developed this institution where monks were charged with copying text, not necessarily reading and learning from them, although I'm sure, and I'm certain many of them did, but there were no printing presses then, and the only way to

13:35.633 --> 13:39.519
to multiply the copies was to, in fact, copy them by hand.

13:39.539 --> 13:44.826
And so I think it's evident what these various monks did.

13:45.387 --> 13:53.739
Going back in history, you talk about the loss of the poetry of Sappho and how many of the great Greek tragedies survived.

13:53.880 --> 14:01.050
In the case of Sophocles and Aeschylus and Euripides, perhaps six or seven out of a hundred, 110 in each case,

14:01.688 --> 14:08.455
Most of them were destroyed or were burned with the destruction of the Alexandrian library.

14:08.675 --> 14:18.485
Fortunately, some were preserved and saved and got down into later centuries where they were copied by these monks who passed them on.

14:18.505 --> 14:26.412
And the humanists came along in the 1300s and 1400s and reclaimed them and passed them on to us.

14:26.432 --> 14:31.037
They were collectors, certainly, weren't they, these Renaissance men?

14:31.169 --> 14:39.143
And so much of the way culture evolves has to do with its preservation.

14:40.605 --> 14:46.496
I think so, and not only how it evolves, but how we even have any record of it.

14:48.098 --> 14:56.012
I think I point out that so much of what we know about culture and literature and history would be lost forever if it weren't for these people who collected.

14:56.347 --> 15:01.231
And so often these collectors aren't necessarily scholars or geniuses.

15:01.692 --> 15:09.038
And one of the really wonderful things about collecting is that sometimes people collect things that everybody else considers junk or rubbish.

15:09.058 --> 15:14.703
And that's the only reason that survives is because this particular person saw merit in keeping it.

15:15.424 --> 15:22.850
And its importance was discovered in later generations because somebody had the foresight or the passion or the whatever to save it.

15:23.551 --> 15:25.813
And because it was saved, people can rediscover it.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.141
And I think you do find that.

15:28.502 --> 15:42.314
I mean, I tell a very cute story in the book about this Michael Zinman who acquired, I mean, it's a funny story, and this enormous collection of pornography.

15:42.755 --> 15:47.819
He had no interest in it, but it was offered to him, and he said, why did he buy it?

15:47.859 --> 15:51.903
Well, because the dollars were right, and it was probably comprehensive.

15:51.923 --> 15:56.087
When he saw it, it was horrible, and he was ashamed even to send it off to the landfill.

15:56.590 --> 16:00.115
He tried to get rid of it quietly, and lo and behold, what happens?

16:00.476 --> 16:11.132
The University of Texas, the Humanities Research Center in Austin, has all the papers of a Lyndon Johnson commission which studied pornography, but they had no examples of this material.

16:11.813 --> 16:22.789
And so they took this collection and they entered it there, and what you have is as abhorrent and as worthless as this material is, nevertheless, it does have a function as an artifact.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.792
And if somebody didn't...

16:25.345 --> 16:28.508
preserve this at some point, you wouldn't have this material to study.

16:28.788 --> 16:33.774
I mean, it is important, I think, that you preserve the horrible things along with the beautiful things.

16:34.474 --> 16:42.382
I mean, there are extraordinary collections of material coming out of the Third Reich and Holocaust material.

16:43.283 --> 16:49.790
As abhorrent as they are, it's essential that they be preserved and available to scholars.

16:49.810 --> 16:55.015
I don't know if that's responsive to a particular question, but in any case,

16:55.906 --> 16:57.027
Grant County, go ahead.

16:57.968 --> 16:58.088
Hi.

16:58.529 --> 16:59.310
Wonderful program.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.994
A zillion thoughts running through my mind, maybe just a few for you.

17:03.875 --> 17:08.059
First, I'd like to publicly thank my wife for letting me indulge in this passion.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.162
She is the woman who keeps me in check.

17:11.303 --> 17:16.028
When we go on vacation, we have to plan part of our vacation around bookstore visits.

17:16.569 --> 17:20.033
I call them bonus book days, and she lets me indulge my little passion.

17:21.494 --> 17:24.057
I came to collecting maybe late in life for me.

17:24.712 --> 17:27.415
when people start to settle down and have a place to put books.

17:27.476 --> 17:38.870
I started collecting when I was about 35, and I found, like people have said along, that you sort of collect a subset of books, and I find that there are books in my collection.

17:38.890 --> 17:47.321
I collect science and nature books, and there are things I probably would not trade for a Gutenberg Bible.

17:47.341 --> 17:50.365
Although certain things may be valuable as books,

17:51.273 --> 17:56.662
There are things that are just so valuable to me, whereas a Gutenberg Bible would be much more meaningful to somebody else.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.887
I wouldn't even probably want it in my collection.

18:00.628 --> 18:14.690
And although you said earlier on books are inanimate, I find that they are one of the main animators of me, and it is just one of my real passions, which I do have to keep in check.

18:15.151 --> 18:18.917
The thing I'm faced with, not that I'm that old, I mean,

18:19.201 --> 18:25.607
in my mid-forties, and I have no children, my wife and I have no children, I keep thinking, what am I going to do with all these books?

18:26.468 --> 18:48.229
A lot of books that I acquired, at least recently in the Madison area, were from a guy who, through a variety of machinations, I traced to being a professor at one of them's neighboring colleges, and I guess he's still alive, but at a point late in his life, he decided that he was going to dispose of his collection of science and nature books.

18:48.530 --> 18:52.116
And I own a great part of his collection, I think.

18:52.376 --> 19:01.652
And I'm just so happy that they wound up and used bookstores, and now I can have them and use them because it's great.

19:01.712 --> 19:05.618
So I always wonder, what am I going to do with my books when I get to the end?

19:05.859 --> 19:12.850
I think it's the central dilemma, and I address it in the very first paragraph of my first chapter, and I come back to it in the epilogue.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.645
What do you do with your books?

19:15.966 --> 19:17.928
Some people give them to institutions.

19:17.968 --> 19:19.610
Some people form libraries.

19:20.391 --> 19:26.037
Other people send them off with the whispered hope that they'll find a happy new life in the next generation.

19:26.077 --> 19:30.942
As long as you take care of them, they'll find a proper home.

19:32.764 --> 19:38.230
And I think it's very commendable also that many people do

19:38.581 --> 19:41.524
offer their books up for sale because you have to replenish the stock.

19:41.564 --> 19:43.526
I mean, there have to be books for people to get.

19:44.087 --> 19:59.503
And I think another thing that you touched on, which is very important, is that the beauty of book collecting, and I just can't think of any other collectible, any area of collecting or hobby where you can collect and you can find great satisfaction at any level.

20:00.544 --> 20:06.951
Of course, if you have millions of dollars and there's a Gutenberg Bible available, which there aren't any more, you can buy one.

20:07.252 --> 20:18.326
But you can also have a great deal of fun and derive tremendous satisfaction by spending $0.25, $0.50 at yard sales, discovering things that people consider trash.

20:18.366 --> 20:26.777
The great story is the man who found Poe's Camerlane in an antiques barn no more than 30 miles from where I live.

20:26.817 --> 20:28.460
I keep thinking, this should have been me.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.685
I would have recognized this book for $15 and selling it at a

20:33.003 --> 20:34.264
at an auction for $198,000.

20:34.284 --> 20:41.332
I mean, these discoveries are made all the time, and you can do this at any level with great satisfaction.

20:41.752 --> 20:58.810
I think what's important and what this gentleman just pointed out is that these are the books that have meaning for you as an individual, and that's what makes collecting so unique, is that every collection has your own signature on it because it reflects your personality and your likes and your dislikes.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.512
And how does your collection do that for you?

21:01.150 --> 21:03.312
Oh, in many ways.

21:05.394 --> 21:13.762
When I started researching this book, as I said earlier in the hour, I just became impassioned about getting books on books.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.383
Now, it's not just books on books.

21:15.463 --> 21:16.824
It's auction catalogs.

21:18.006 --> 21:19.567
I am a bookseller's dream.

21:19.627 --> 21:29.436
I would go to these flea markets, and they would have these crates of old auction catalogs tattered that they would be thrilled to have me take off their hands for $5 or $10

21:29.939 --> 21:38.289
But you find information in these things that you just can't find anyplace else, bibliographical information on certain books and titles, little historical nuggets.

21:39.410 --> 21:40.912
These are things that I collect.

21:40.952 --> 21:47.660
This certainly reflects my personality, my books on books, my biographies of authors.

21:47.760 --> 21:55.930
I have a wonderful collection of literary biographies, literary criticism, and all kinds of other things.

21:56.281 --> 21:59.805
I'm sure you don't have the time to hear outlined in great detail.

21:59.825 --> 22:04.911
But I guess it reflects my interests and my likes and my passions, my vocation.

22:05.272 --> 22:08.095
A book collection can do this for anybody.

22:08.155 --> 22:09.477
You have a sense of calling about it.

22:11.159 --> 22:16.745
I wouldn't call it a sense of mission, but I would certainly call it an obsession without question.

22:17.847 --> 22:22.152
Well, I want to thank you for a really wonderful hour of conversation.

22:23.113 --> 22:25.596
A description made of Isaiah Thomas.

22:25.694 --> 22:29.286
who was one of my characters in the Americana section.

22:29.326 --> 22:34.422
And when he died, his grandson, Benjamin Franklin Thomas, that grandfather was afflicted

22:34.992 --> 22:39.897
From the earliest age, with this gentlest of infirmities, he was a bibliomaniac.

22:40.337 --> 22:47.685
And, of course, the result of his particular bibliomania was formation of the American Antiquarian Society.

22:47.705 --> 22:48.085
Wonderful.

22:48.446 --> 22:51.949
