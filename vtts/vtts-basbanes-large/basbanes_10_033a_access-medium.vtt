WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:06.220
We're talking to Alfred Kazin here, if you just don't mind that.

00:07.522 --> 00:20.036
I think an interesting place to start is that you quote Edmund Wilson three times in this new book to the extent that we have to, I'm paraphrasing, but we no longer need religion.

00:20.656 --> 00:25.462
Do you find that quote as a counterpoint maybe to the theme of this book?

00:25.482 --> 00:28.485
Well, no, it was just... We must live without religion is what he says, right?

00:28.718 --> 00:29.959
Did I quote that three times?

00:30.119 --> 00:31.140
I found it three times.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.502
In the same book?

00:33.222 --> 00:33.903
In this book, yes.

00:33.923 --> 00:34.444
Yeah, very good.

00:34.464 --> 00:34.724
Okay.

00:36.506 --> 00:43.012
Now, Wilson represents, like Mencken and many people in the 20s, which is his real period.

00:43.553 --> 00:49.438
He typically represents, I make that clear in the book, what I call his revolt against his fathers, you know.

00:49.819 --> 00:58.067
His grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, and, you know, at one point in my book, I know all the writers,

00:58.537 --> 00:59.979
Wallace Stevens, H.L.

00:59.999 --> 01:07.487
Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, of the 20s, who all revolted one way or another against their father's religion.

01:08.348 --> 01:14.935
And that's only, it has no relationship to anything that I believe or that is going on right now.

01:15.836 --> 01:24.466
I see, but I'm just wondering if it's kind of a, because you certainly are tracing the influence of religion and it's almost a counterpoint theme, I find.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.246
No, it's not.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.047
It's not, okay.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.649
No, I said it's a personal remark.

01:27.798 --> 01:38.087
Wilson was a very cranky, very self-opinionated man who had made up his mind that, quote, we have to live without religion.

01:38.968 --> 01:43.352
But this did not affect some of the writers of the 20s, like Frost and Steve.

01:43.392 --> 01:45.254
It was his own personal thing itself.

01:45.774 --> 01:49.057
This book appears 55 years after your first book.

01:49.297 --> 01:49.538
Yes.

01:50.378 --> 01:54.422
Do you think this book is appropriate for this point in your career?

01:55.403 --> 01:56.344
I don't know what that means.

01:56.704 --> 01:57.805
Well, do you think it's a...

01:58.223 --> 02:00.005
It's part of a continuum.

02:00.025 --> 02:01.086
I don't think of those terms.

02:01.506 --> 02:01.807
You don't?

02:01.827 --> 02:05.110
I don't think of what my career, I don't think what's appropriate, anything like that.

02:05.611 --> 02:12.618
A lot of my books came out of a deep personal urgency, which had nothing to do with anything except my own problems or my own interests.

02:13.399 --> 02:14.620
I don't think about my career.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.841
I don't believe in careers.

02:16.702 --> 02:21.868
I wrote this book because I've always had a longstanding interest in the subject over 20 years.

02:22.668 --> 02:27.994
And so the book finally became a real thing for me.

02:28.396 --> 02:30.939
But it's nothing to do with being appropriate to my career.

02:31.319 --> 02:41.970
Well, maybe that's the wrong... So do you see a... I hesitate to use the word corpus, but certainly there is a... Let me explain it again.

02:41.990 --> 02:42.570
Okay, okay.

02:42.630 --> 02:47.796
You may find this peculiar, but I don't... I'm not interested in my career.

02:48.356 --> 02:54.943
I don't believe that careers are interesting except, well, to people who... If someone wants to say, this is his career, okay.

02:55.396 --> 02:58.779
But I don't think of a work which is going to be appropriate to my career.

03:00.361 --> 03:01.082
That puzzles you.

03:01.122 --> 03:01.762
I can see that.

03:02.403 --> 03:03.564
But the fact is, that's true.

03:04.025 --> 03:05.927
I didn't write this book to fill out anything.

03:06.867 --> 03:12.093
I wrote on native grounds, published in 1942, because that was the time to write it for me.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.676
For me, not for... I don't look around and say, the country needs a book like this.

03:15.877 --> 03:16.437
You understand?

03:16.477 --> 03:16.797
Yes, sir.

03:17.458 --> 03:17.538
Yes.

03:17.558 --> 03:20.161
What I say is, I want to write a book like this for myself.

03:21.062 --> 03:25.386
All my books come out of my deep personal interest and the rest of it.

03:26.294 --> 03:27.996
What are you working on now?

03:28.056 --> 03:33.242
Well, I can't talk about it because I haven't made up my mind about it.

03:33.262 --> 03:36.325
The book I'm thinking about hasn't quite gelled up my mind.

03:36.826 --> 03:39.649
Again, it's a personal book.

03:39.669 --> 03:41.271
I say personal, my approach to it.

03:41.871 --> 03:52.303
Someone pointed out, someone in the reviewer pointed out very properly that when you read my book, Garth the American Right, you realize that I am like some of the characters I'm writing about.

03:53.204 --> 03:54.445
That's the point, you see.

03:54.745 --> 03:59.433
You mentioned that Melville was transformed by reading Hawthorne.

03:59.453 --> 04:01.296
I love that word, transformed.

04:01.636 --> 04:03.960
Have you ever been transformed by reading anyone?

04:03.980 --> 04:04.801
Of course.

04:05.382 --> 04:07.626
I'm constantly transformed by books.

04:07.666 --> 04:12.173
The word transformed is exactly what I go through when I read all sorts of things.

04:12.313 --> 04:19.405
When we read Moby Dick, which I edited many years ago, I'm always transformed by certain books.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.787
That's a function of a book critic.

04:21.779 --> 04:27.845
There's a certain level of personal excitement in Revelation that occurs between the writer and the book.

04:29.767 --> 04:35.752
And you say you're constantly being transformed even by the same books that you first had contact with?

04:35.772 --> 04:36.313
Well, of course.

04:36.393 --> 04:38.715
If a book is important to you, you keep on reading.

04:38.896 --> 04:40.998
I reread many books.

04:41.018 --> 04:43.140
There's a Bible, the Old and New Testaments.

04:44.561 --> 04:46.543
What does your name come from, Balabanus?

04:46.563 --> 04:47.083
Bazbanes.

04:47.103 --> 04:47.884
It's Greek.

04:47.904 --> 04:48.645
It's Greek.

04:48.665 --> 04:48.765
Yeah.

04:49.218 --> 04:57.830
Well, when I reread certain passages in Plato, The Myth of the Cave and The Republic and that sort of thing, I'm transported.

04:58.250 --> 05:05.400
Anything which makes me feel that somebody I'm reading has a great and wonderful mind and a great view of life transports me.

05:06.601 --> 05:08.924
You know why am I jumping around, I hope, as a question?

05:08.944 --> 05:10.146
How am I going to stop you?

05:12.252 --> 05:19.199
You mentioned in New York Jew, which I love, that opening section in 315 at the New York Public Library.

05:19.259 --> 05:20.060
Yeah, yeah.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.182
I love that whole section.

05:22.302 --> 05:25.545
I'm really going to write an appreciation of reading rooms.

05:26.026 --> 05:36.756
You mentioned that you spent five years working up, making your way, reading, to read that, to be able to write that book.

05:36.776 --> 05:39.559
Did you have a sense during those five years,

05:39.995 --> 05:43.919
where you were headed, or were you just reading, were you just kind of... Did I have a sense of what?

05:43.939 --> 05:50.927
A sense of the book that you were working towards, of what you were formulating as a work of criticism.

05:52.068 --> 05:54.851
Well, of course, but I'm not sure I understand your question exactly.

05:55.011 --> 06:04.702
Well, I'm just wondering if you were reading to transform yourself, or if you were... No, no, you put these things in a way that I find not easy to understand.

06:04.742 --> 06:07.605
You pick a subject,

06:07.957 --> 06:09.318
It was the 1930s.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.599
I was a young man.

06:10.659 --> 06:13.902
The country was in crisis.

06:14.743 --> 06:16.384
American literature was coming back.

06:17.205 --> 06:17.806
Not coming back.

06:17.846 --> 06:22.009
It was becoming, for the first time, an important literature for a lot of people.

06:22.690 --> 06:29.136
And I got fascinated by starting the book in the 80s and 90s, where no one usually starts, and writing about it.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.678
If you know the book, you know that I wasn't transported.

06:31.758 --> 06:35.561
I just used the word about classics, which reinvigorated me.

06:37.583 --> 06:37.643
OK.

06:38.416 --> 06:47.444
And you also mentioned that you had, they almost sound like ecstatic days in Room 315, where you had long, full-day bouts with reading.

06:47.704 --> 06:48.365
Yes, yes.

06:48.385 --> 06:50.767
Do you continue to have full-day bouts?

06:50.867 --> 06:51.668
Of course I can.

06:51.688 --> 06:58.254
I'm now 82, and like any gentleman of 82, I have physical problems.

06:58.934 --> 07:06.381
But of course, as you can tell from my recent book, God, the American Writer, that I still work with the same intensity I always did.

07:07.103 --> 07:10.487
I may be slowing up in a year or two, but the moment I'm okay.

07:12.789 --> 07:26.224
Of course, the first, when you were working with that first book, did you expect that you would spend your entire career really studying American literature?

07:26.264 --> 07:27.185
No, not at all.

07:27.205 --> 07:29.407
I expected nothing, except to be drafted.

07:30.308 --> 07:31.410
It was during the war period.

07:32.571 --> 07:36.435
And when the war was, when I finished my book, I was indeed summoned by it.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.232
the draft board and the rest of it.

07:38.252 --> 07:38.993
It was wartime.

07:40.615 --> 07:42.238
You know what was going on there.

07:42.258 --> 07:43.379
I had no expectations.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.584
The success of the book surprised me.

07:46.684 --> 07:47.525
I was very glad.

07:48.366 --> 07:53.073
But I also had personal problems, personal things, which interested me much more at that point.

07:55.536 --> 07:59.502
You mentioned a question or two back, the function of the critic.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.785
Do you have a sense of your reader?

08:02.246 --> 08:04.168
Do you have a sense of who you're writing for?

08:04.188 --> 08:06.051
Oh, absolutely.

08:07.077 --> 08:09.781
A lot of professors write for each other.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.105
I do write for what Virginia Woolf called the common reader.

08:13.566 --> 08:14.847
I'm a common reader myself.

08:15.468 --> 08:19.153
I read many critics, like I just had a piece about the English critic V.S.

08:19.253 --> 08:20.675
Pritchett for the Times Book Review.

08:21.136 --> 08:24.000
When I read him, he's talking to me and I learn from him.

08:25.021 --> 08:29.167
And when I write something and the writer says to me, I never thought of that before, that's very good.

08:29.447 --> 08:31.990
Of course, I don't aim at the reader.

08:32.491 --> 08:36.156
I aim to express what I myself most deeply feel.

08:36.473 --> 08:43.099
But if you do that successfully, then of course the reader receives your message.

08:43.119 --> 08:44.721
Do you hear from your readers?

08:45.722 --> 08:46.282
Of course.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.005
Of course a lot of people write to me.

08:50.206 --> 08:56.752
Do you, you know, we were talking about the demise of libraries.

08:56.772 --> 09:04.860
I just came back from San Francisco where they opened a brand new library, and I sent 200,000 books off to the landfill.

09:05.482 --> 09:08.866
you know, because they didn't fit on the shelves of the new library.

09:09.306 --> 09:10.888
Do you think about this at all?

09:10.908 --> 09:11.488
Of course.

09:12.349 --> 09:18.396
Well, I mean, everybody knows what's going on right now.

09:18.436 --> 09:27.245
There's no question that television and movies and the media generally have taken away a lot of the appeal.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.567
People don't read the way they used to.

09:28.987 --> 09:32.451
On the other hand, there's a vast publication industry.

09:33.089 --> 09:37.114
But, of course, there's a great interest in getting bestsellers and the rest of it.

09:38.155 --> 09:43.841
I think the literacy is not what it used to be, for a very good reason that it isn't.

09:45.143 --> 09:48.667
You know, I was just reading a book the other night, When Russia Learned to Read.

09:48.967 --> 09:50.108
I don't know if you're familiar with that book.

09:50.129 --> 09:50.969
It was published in 1985.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.091
No, I don't know it.

09:52.211 --> 09:59.299
But a very interesting statistic, and they're able to look at census figures, people who were able to sign their forms, and it was taxation.

09:59.549 --> 10:04.034
In 1897, only 21% of the Russian population could read.

10:04.394 --> 10:07.498
And yet this was a period when you had the great novelists.

10:08.058 --> 10:10.601
I mean, the great Russian novelists.

10:10.661 --> 10:11.902
Nobody surprised you.

10:11.923 --> 10:13.244
There's nothing surprising about that.

10:13.704 --> 10:15.386
Russia was a closed society.

10:15.426 --> 10:17.929
There was no liberty.

10:17.949 --> 10:18.670
There was no freedom.

10:19.251 --> 10:24.056
That's why my mother and father, born in Russia, eventually found their way individually to America.

10:25.117 --> 10:28.881
Also, the great Russian writers, after Chekhov,

10:29.182 --> 10:30.363
were all aristocrats.

10:30.824 --> 10:32.425
They belonged to a very special class.

10:32.605 --> 10:34.067
So they were writing for their peers?

10:34.307 --> 10:35.949
No, they weren't writing for their peers.

10:36.349 --> 10:37.590
They were writing an attempt.

10:38.391 --> 10:38.712
No.

10:39.172 --> 10:39.973
Well, that's my point.

10:40.253 --> 10:44.357
If 80% of the people in their country couldn't read, who were they writing for?

10:44.377 --> 10:48.902
Well, enough people read them, and also they had a vast international audience.

10:48.922 --> 10:52.585
I mean, Tolstoy is as well known as Tolson Dostoevsky.

10:52.625 --> 10:52.926
Of course.

10:52.966 --> 10:53.707
To read it before.

10:53.727 --> 10:54.227
Okay.

10:54.865 --> 11:00.071
It's not an arithmetical subject.

11:00.631 --> 11:05.557
I guess I'm trying to put it in the context that people are saying, well, literacy is declining in this nation.

11:05.957 --> 11:12.184
I wonder if that's relevant to whether or not serious literature will continue to be produced regardless of how many people.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.869
Well, that question is raised all the time, and you'll be happy to hear that I have no answer, whatever.

11:16.670 --> 11:23.337
So long as there are writers, so long as there are a lot of them, after all, everybody,

11:23.570 --> 11:26.234
Everybody knows every day there's some new young novelist.

11:26.254 --> 11:33.484
And there are all sorts of people coming into the literary world, women, blacks, Hispanics, who never wrote before.

11:34.505 --> 11:41.135
I, as a Jew, among the first two, I mean, after all, there weren't many Jewish writers at the beginning of the 20th century.

11:41.756 --> 11:43.959
And now, since the 40s, there have been a great many.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.561
We've all been liberated.

11:45.601 --> 11:47.263
We've all been sprung free to write.

11:48.085 --> 11:50.488
But the question, go back to Russia.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.692
There was a vast population of Russians.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.057
That small percentage, nevertheless, involved a great many readers.

11:58.860 --> 12:09.475
All the great Russian writers wrote for a general audience the way Victor Hugo did in France, the way Dickens did in England, etc.

12:09.615 --> 12:20.070
I gather from what I read that you would certainly consider Faulkner the great American novelist of the 20th century.

12:20.151 --> 12:21.893
Yes, I do.

12:22.463 --> 12:28.249
and Melville, of course, the great American novelist of the 19th century.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.734
I'm striving for something here.

12:32.934 --> 12:34.015
What are you striving for?

12:34.035 --> 12:37.118
Well, it's interesting that they were both basically rejected in their lifetimes.

12:37.178 --> 12:42.484
And you also say here that Melville, at a moment of peak, hit Billy Budd for the 20th century.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.446
No, wait a second, wait a second.

12:44.466 --> 12:47.809
You're talking too loosely here.

12:48.450 --> 12:51.373
In the first place, Melville was rejected.

12:51.742 --> 12:52.803
And he stopped writing.

12:53.364 --> 12:58.590
And there's no question that, you know, he wrote poetry near the end of his life, privately published.

12:58.630 --> 12:59.731
I say all that in my book.

13:01.313 --> 13:02.895
And it was supported by an uncle.

13:03.836 --> 13:07.901
And then, you know, he made a living as a customs inspector.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.963
For Faulkner was not rejected in any way.

13:09.983 --> 13:16.331
Well, he rejected, but you mentioned that it was Malcolm Cowley that made it possible for him to be accepted.

13:16.591 --> 13:21.597
Excuse me, the fact remains that around the time, well, you know, Faulkner is an original.

13:21.897 --> 13:27.905
Many people, including myself and on native grounds, didn't pay proper appreciation to him because he is so original.

13:28.486 --> 13:33.673
And when we began, the boom be began, his renaissance began in the late 40s.

13:34.294 --> 13:38.940
But all his great books, the greatest books, were written in 1930s, published in 1930s and 40s.

13:39.561 --> 13:48.934
But you can hardly speak of rejection of a man who at one time had to make a living writing motion pictures, but the other hand got the Nobel Prize and became the great figure.

13:49.268 --> 13:51.072
So there's no real comparison.

13:51.092 --> 13:55.220
There's no comparison, and rejection, of course, is a very severe word.

13:55.882 --> 14:04.500
But by the same token, you mentioned that it was Malcolm Cowley who was very influential in bringing a reader.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.001
Yes, he was.

14:05.101 --> 14:06.885
An appreciative readership, so far.

14:06.905 --> 14:07.325
Yes, he was.

14:07.566 --> 14:09.049
But it wasn't the only, it was one.

14:09.417 --> 14:09.958
I'm sorry.

14:10.278 --> 14:10.498
Go ahead.

14:10.658 --> 14:11.419
No, finish.

14:11.439 --> 14:17.805
Well, do you think that Faulkner would still enjoy the stature he does today without Cowley's help?

14:17.865 --> 14:18.185
Yes, yes.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.947
Cowley didn't perform any miracles.

14:20.488 --> 14:36.623
Well, he did the portable, the... He did a lot, but the fact remains that Faulkner owes a lot of his reputation to the fact that the universities, especially in the South, were more open now, you know, and Faulkner was the hero of a great many Southern writers.

14:37.531 --> 14:42.217
And they did a great deal to bring it up, you know.

14:42.237 --> 14:56.617
To go back to Melville and to separate him off from Faulkner then, is it a phenomenon that somebody so ahead of his time does have to wait a while for a new generation to accept him?

14:56.637 --> 14:59.541
Well, you asked me a question, and you are a literary reporter, right?

14:59.621 --> 14:59.922
Yes, sir.

15:00.002 --> 15:02.205
But you know the answer as well as I do to that.

15:03.097 --> 15:05.059
You can't think of any examples for yourself.

15:05.119 --> 15:11.006
Of course I can, but I... The most famous example was Emily Dickinson, who was hardly published at all in her time.

15:11.126 --> 15:13.229
Did she want to be published in her view, do you think?

15:13.429 --> 15:17.394
I think she did, but there was no opportunity, for one reason or another.

15:17.414 --> 15:20.998
She was discouraged, actually, by her... She wasn't, she wasn't, no.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.382
The question didn't come up until her death.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.307
She wasn't discouraged, and she wasn't encouraged.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.208
She was all alone.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.091
The idea of a spinster living...

15:32.662 --> 15:38.767
in the leading family of Amherst writing poetry, it didn't mean very much people.

15:38.787 --> 15:44.852
People were not as open as they are right now about these things.

15:44.892 --> 15:51.298
You mentioned how you got to know Robert Frost and you would walk with him one-on-one.

15:51.358 --> 15:53.960
You would be an audience of one, you would say.

15:54.280 --> 15:54.921
I was the audience.

15:55.101 --> 15:56.322
I was the audience.

15:56.382 --> 15:58.524
You were the audience of one, is what you were saying.

15:58.704 --> 16:00.105
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.247
I'm wondering how much

16:03.155 --> 16:12.087
What impact does it have on you to go beyond the work and to know the author personally or the individual?

16:12.487 --> 16:20.157
If I know the author, as I did, I got to know Frost by an accident of my being a professor briefly at Amherst College.

16:20.177 --> 16:24.603
It means a great deal, but it doesn't mix up your value of the work.

16:24.623 --> 16:29.770
I never met Emily Dickinson, but I know what she was like, and I love her poetry.

16:31.522 --> 16:34.726
It all depends upon your contact with the writer.

16:34.746 --> 16:38.311
Had you known Faulkner, would you think there would be others?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.372
I couldn't have known Faulkner.

16:39.392 --> 16:41.615
Faulkner was extremely asocial.

16:42.456 --> 16:47.143
A friend of mine once saw him in the waiting room at Random House, waiting to see his editor.

16:47.723 --> 16:51.268
And he got very excited, went over to him, hoping to have a conversation.

16:52.169 --> 16:56.255
And Faulkner rebuffed him and said, I didn't come here to talk.

16:56.275 --> 17:00.280
I only heard him show him once in my life, when he won the National Book Award for

17:00.749 --> 17:10.501
one of his inferior novels, the one about the Christ in the trenches in the First World War.

17:11.422 --> 17:15.407
Anyway, then he just mumbled a few words to his audience and walked off.

17:16.888 --> 17:23.196
There's a wonderful story about how Bennett Cerf gave a party for Faulkner one night,

17:23.513 --> 17:28.498
and Alfred Knopf came with some books that he wanted him to sign, and Faulkner refused to do it.

17:28.898 --> 17:31.280
He said, I make money doing these things.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.781
I don't believe that story for a minute.

17:32.862 --> 17:34.383
It's in Blatner's biography.

17:34.543 --> 17:35.124
I don't believe it.

17:35.924 --> 17:36.285
You don't.

17:36.605 --> 17:38.086
Is this his biography of Faulkner?

17:38.106 --> 17:39.287
Yeah.

17:39.307 --> 17:53.200
I don't think Faulkner said that, but anyway, when a man like Blatner writes a biography, you know, he's like a, he's like someone cleaning up with, he gets every little morsel he can, you know.

17:53.568 --> 17:56.791
Is that important, talking about Faulkner?

17:56.811 --> 17:58.093
No, of course not.

17:58.893 --> 18:02.697
But you do point, I think what's important is that you say that Faulkner chose art over religion.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.960
I think that's very important.

18:05.040 --> 18:05.981
Yes, it is indeed.

18:06.842 --> 18:09.104
I'm very proud of that.

18:11.426 --> 18:22.798
Because the point is that the South around him, especially in his own hometown of Oxford, was full of that, you know, Southern religion, you know, which he didn't personally have no interest in.

18:26.153 --> 18:28.456
I'm just looking at my notes.

18:28.536 --> 18:31.860
Are these all notes from your reading here?

18:33.041 --> 18:44.836
I didn't know that Edmund Wilson actually explored the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls ... You mentioned that he ... I didn't say he explored the caves.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.438
He went down there.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.743
I don't think ... He didn't ... Excuse me, but your facts are not right.

18:51.010 --> 18:52.071
I never saw he explore.

18:52.091 --> 18:53.273
I never said he explored the cave.

18:53.293 --> 18:58.440
Well, he didn't explore, but he certainly must have gone to field, get a sense of the... Yes, he did that.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.302
Of the... That's what I mean by that.

19:00.382 --> 19:03.787
The only people who explored the cave... I didn't mean he was an archaeologist.

19:03.867 --> 19:12.498
I meant that he was there to... The only people who explored the cave were the original shepherds, whoever they were, who found the stuff in the cave.

19:12.518 --> 19:19.988
Again, I don't mean... Mr. Wilson was too fat and often too drunk to get on his knees in a cave.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.556
I didn't mean explore in terms of archaeology.

19:23.676 --> 19:26.960
I meant in terms of going to absorb the ambience, I guess.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.042
Of course, exactly so.

19:29.243 --> 19:29.804
Exactly so.

19:30.585 --> 19:33.529
Wilson was fascinated by languages.

19:33.949 --> 19:39.456
As you already know, he didn't have any personal interest in religion, but he was a fantastic scholar.

19:39.497 --> 19:40.318
Everything interests him.

19:40.978 --> 19:43.582
He had the greatest gift for languages I've ever encountered.

19:44.823 --> 19:45.785
I say that in my book.

19:45.805 --> 19:47.046
He was reading every language.

19:47.847 --> 19:49.890
So when the discovery was made...

19:50.393 --> 19:53.137
He called himself a journalist in the best sense of the way.

19:53.157 --> 20:00.007
He went down there, Kwam Ram and all those places around the Dead Sea to see what the city was like.

20:00.027 --> 20:03.211
He describes it in his book, the Dead Sea Scrolls.

20:03.231 --> 20:06.716
But he didn't do any exploring himself.

20:06.736 --> 20:08.699
I didn't mean to suggest that.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.406
I know I used the word, but I didn't mean it in a sense that he was an archaeologist.

20:13.426 --> 20:16.830
But I guess he went to get something.

20:16.871 --> 20:19.354
And I guess what I was trying to lead to is,

20:19.908 --> 20:25.353
Your own travels, do you try and go places that were very close?

20:25.373 --> 20:27.355
No, I do, and I no longer do.

20:27.375 --> 20:27.936
But you did.

20:27.956 --> 20:28.937
You've done that, of course.

20:28.977 --> 20:29.718
I've done that.

20:29.738 --> 20:39.047
I mean, in 1967, I was very lucky to be sent to Harper's to do something about the Israeli war there.

20:43.070 --> 20:47.755
During the war, I was not a soldier, but I was a reporter in England.

20:48.224 --> 20:49.646
And that gave me a lot of stuff.

20:49.666 --> 20:53.730
I did that, but not out of a journalistic thing, but because I was commissioned.

20:54.691 --> 21:01.738
When Our Native Grounds came out in 1942, the Rockefeller Foundation was very pleased that I published a book.

21:01.758 --> 21:04.201
They had given me a fellowship to study for it.

21:04.301 --> 21:11.389
And there was a big program going on in England, an educational program in the Army, which they wanted to document.

21:12.390 --> 21:16.594
And since I was free to travel, and I was dying to travel,

21:17.249 --> 21:18.251
It was a perfect match.

21:18.791 --> 21:21.335
And I went there, and I spent the last six, seven months of the war in England.

21:21.736 --> 21:25.001
I wrote about that in my book, in several of my books.

21:25.021 --> 21:26.183
It was a big experience for me.

21:26.844 --> 21:29.207
But otherwise, I never did much journalistic writing.

21:30.289 --> 21:35.337
The essay, the long essay on Israel, the 67 War, I did for Harper's.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.805
But since then, I haven't done very much.

21:40.825 --> 21:42.548
Excluding anything you might have done...

21:43.861 --> 21:45.443
in foreign countries.

21:45.483 --> 21:46.444
How about in this country?

21:46.464 --> 21:50.149
Have you gone to feel in a similar way the ambiance of things?

21:50.549 --> 21:51.050
Yes, I have.

21:51.370 --> 22:01.003
But always, not always, well, one of the big events of my life, which I describe again in my books, these are all my books, I've concealed nothing.

22:02.124 --> 22:04.787
I'm not an inventive writer any more than Wilson was.

22:04.848 --> 22:07.130
I write about my experiences.

22:07.971 --> 22:11.556
In the 1940s, the great photographer Cartier Gerson and I

22:11.873 --> 22:20.324
were assigned to do a piece for Harper's Bazaar on Lower New York and the bridges and all that, especially Brooklyn Bridge, which has been a lifelong icon of my life.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.589
So we did that, and I wrote an article for Harper's Bazaar.

22:24.129 --> 22:37.948
And there were many journalistic pieces I did for different places, yes, but I never did them in that, for example, Wilson was sent by the New Yorker during the Second World War to do what he put in the coverage, whereas

22:38.620 --> 22:42.746
I've done a lot of traveling, but it was mostly because of my visiting teaching.

22:43.186 --> 22:45.209
I've been a visiting professor in many countries.

22:46.731 --> 22:51.958
It was all based upon a native ground, which a lot of people in Europe and elsewhere.

22:51.978 --> 22:57.645
And I lectured in Russia and Japan and in Germany and England, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

22:57.665 --> 23:05.556
But in all those cases, I was in a foreign country because I was a visiting professor there, not because I'd been assigned to go there.

23:06.565 --> 23:09.068
But I mean, I'm talking specifically about this country.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.269
Yeah, I said that.

23:10.289 --> 23:11.110
I gave an example.

23:11.650 --> 23:14.934
Well, New York and all its reaches has always been an obsession of mine.

23:16.295 --> 23:21.861
But as I say, that piece I did for Harper's Bazaar was pretty much it, you know.

23:23.062 --> 23:28.889
I've done a lot of travel writing about America, but almost always because I was assigned to give a lecture somewhere.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.330
I was a visiting professor somewhere.

23:30.470 --> 23:34.935
So I guess you've never felt that you had to go to a place like...

23:35.202 --> 23:43.412
up in Western Massachusetts, near Pittsfield, to look out on Mount Greylock the way Melville might have, and to see why you would dedicate a book to a mountain.

23:43.472 --> 23:46.495
I mean, I... Well, as a matter of fact, I did go to Western Massachusetts.

23:46.516 --> 23:47.677
That's what I'm asking, yeah.

23:47.697 --> 23:50.420
But that was because of my literary interest in Melville.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.683
And that's what I'm trying to... Yeah, well, I did go.

23:52.703 --> 23:57.048
I did go to Arrowhead, his house, and I did see a Mount Greylock through a window.

23:57.689 --> 24:01.193
And when you're doing something like that, do you try and

24:01.477 --> 24:07.686
and imagine what might have moved him to dedicate Pierre, for instance, to this mountain?

24:07.786 --> 24:10.731
I don't think that way.

24:12.153 --> 24:15.158
When I saw Mount Greylock, I was glad to see it.

24:15.178 --> 24:16.079
It looked like a mountain.

24:16.820 --> 24:27.136
But what really interested me was the fact that some silly girl coming in was angry because she said, oh God, the guy took the biggest room in the house, and I found this very amusing.

24:28.077 --> 24:30.741
And that understanding that he was the reason they had the house.

24:31.987 --> 24:37.454
I'm interested in authors' lives, because I'm interested in authors, period.

24:37.474 --> 24:38.495
You know, always have been.

24:39.296 --> 24:41.779
Sometimes there's a connection with the work, sometimes there's not.

24:43.021 --> 24:45.203
But authors themselves are fascinating beings.

24:47.526 --> 24:58.479
Would you, and this, please don't consider this a trite question, but would you say that you are a product of your reading, of the books that you've read?

24:58.740 --> 24:59.000
No.

24:59.861 --> 25:01.403
I'm a product of my ancestry.

25:01.906 --> 25:04.870
of the Brooklyn neighborhood where I was born.

25:04.890 --> 25:07.173
Reading has been a great part of my life.

25:07.233 --> 25:08.755
I'm not a product of my reading.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.957
You can't put it that way.

25:11.139 --> 25:12.541
That's a question, and you answered it.

25:12.561 --> 25:14.403
You're not, is the answer.

25:14.423 --> 25:17.127
The answer is I'm a product of a lot of things.

25:17.147 --> 25:24.117
I'm very much a product of Jewish history, of Jewish experience, of my parents' poverty, of this and that.

25:27.361 --> 25:28.723
That is a...

25:30.087 --> 25:45.224
That correspondence between Melville and Hawthorne, and what a tragedy that Melville destroyed the letters he received.

25:45.264 --> 25:49.528
Do you have any sense of why he might have done that, why he might have destroyed those letters?

25:49.829 --> 25:59.419
I think anybody who reads, it's quite clear that Melville was very taken with Hawthorne, admired him very much.

26:00.479 --> 26:06.286
A lot of private people try to make some kind of incipient homosexual thing of it.

26:06.406 --> 26:14.435
Hawthorne was not only a very happily married man, but very sexual.

26:15.296 --> 26:25.567
And of course, as you know, if you've read the Billy Budd, things like that, you know that possibly because of his long life as a sailor, Melville was not unacquainted with what goes on in shipboarding.

26:27.490 --> 26:27.730
Interesting.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.592
But most important thing is that...

26:30.888 --> 26:33.570
It was not a sexual thing that drew him to Hawthorne.

26:34.131 --> 26:40.997
It was a recognition that he was a genius like himself, but a genius who was recognized while he was still unrecognized.

26:42.078 --> 26:48.064
And, of course, the letters that Melville wrote to Hawthorne are all available.

26:48.204 --> 26:48.724
And they're wonderful.

26:48.744 --> 26:49.365
I quote some of them.

26:49.385 --> 26:50.926
The ones you quote are magnificent.

26:50.946 --> 26:51.927
They are magnificent.

26:52.548 --> 26:58.373
But it's quite obvious that Hawthorne, though he admired—Hawthorne—Moby Dick was dedicated to Hawthorne.

26:58.893 --> 27:00.675
Hawthorne admired him very much.

27:01.043 --> 27:02.584
But they were very different people.

27:03.505 --> 27:06.628
Hawthorne was a thoroughly married man.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.851
Melville had a very unhappy marriage in many ways.

27:12.072 --> 27:19.419
And it was obvious that, for one, I'm only guessing now.

27:19.439 --> 27:20.800
I've never seen any of it.

27:20.820 --> 27:28.827
It's obvious that Hawthorne's letters could not have been sufficient for the kind of feeling he brought the thing in.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.088
He was probably disappointed.

27:30.254 --> 27:33.257
Maybe they didn't give the approbation that he did.

27:33.317 --> 27:34.438
No, I didn't say that.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.239
No, you didn't say that.

27:35.259 --> 27:35.979
I'm just asking.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.301
That's the question.

27:37.821 --> 27:45.789
I think he wanted some kind of recognition of his feeling, and I think Hawthorne gave him that, but he couldn't give him the intensity.

27:47.190 --> 27:57.780
Melville's letters to Hawthorne are the most intense letters ever written, to my knowledge, by one writer to another.

27:59.465 --> 28:01.007
They're extraordinary, they're wonderful.

28:07.013 --> 28:11.037
But Hawthorne, Hawthorne was a very different kind of personality.

28:11.637 --> 28:13.719
He was all closed up and the rest of it.

28:13.739 --> 28:20.426
You might say that Hawthorne was always classical and Melville was always romantic, but I give that as an approximate thing, yeah.

28:20.947 --> 28:21.787
I won't take up too much.

28:21.847 --> 28:22.648
It's okay, it's okay.

28:23.909 --> 28:29.455
You mentioned also that you can't think of another case where one writer's reading of another writer

28:29.924 --> 28:36.735
has so, to use your word, transformed... Excuse me, I didn't say there was no other case like that.

28:37.075 --> 28:38.678
I didn't say... You said that just now.

28:40.461 --> 28:51.578
Well, I think you said it's the most... I'm paraphrasing, of course I will... No, no, the fact is that the word... It's the most dramatic case of... There's no end of cases of writers who discover everything from being another writer.

28:52.279 --> 28:53.461
It's not at all unusual.

28:54.984 --> 28:57.788
Well, I mean, could you...

28:58.493 --> 29:01.016
think of any other cases that are equally as dramatic as this.

29:01.036 --> 29:01.677
Well, how do you know?

29:01.757 --> 29:02.998
You're telling me or you're asking me?

29:03.018 --> 29:04.220
I'm asking you.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.521
There are many such cases.

29:07.364 --> 29:09.746
Whitman, for example, was inspired by Emerson.

29:11.368 --> 29:15.393
Emerson was inspired by general literature.

29:15.653 --> 29:22.922
That famous sentence that Melville wrote, one genius recognized another, you know, come together.

29:23.323 --> 29:25.345
It's very common.

29:27.417 --> 29:32.744
The writers depend upon each other in a very great sense, you know.

29:32.764 --> 29:34.126
American literature is full of this.

29:34.667 --> 29:41.196
Emily Dickinson was inspired by hymns of the 17th century.

29:41.617 --> 29:48.186
She was very much inspired by Carlisle and Mrs. Browning, whose pictures she kept in her room.

29:49.287 --> 29:55.416
In the 20th century, for example, well, you know, a lot of French writers have been

29:55.649 --> 30:00.696
For example, Camus, the French writer, was very much influenced by Faulkner.

30:00.716 --> 30:08.707
In Paris, 1945, I was lucky enough to hear Camus talk about Faulkner, whom he called, of course, Faulkner.

30:09.468 --> 30:11.711
And he said, I love Faulkner.

30:11.731 --> 30:14.675
He said, I love the dust and the heat in his work.

30:14.736 --> 30:16.097
I'm a southerner myself.

30:16.378 --> 30:18.080
You know that Camus came from Algeria.

30:18.881 --> 30:25.150
No, what is remarkable about the Melville Hawthorne business,

30:25.619 --> 30:29.966
is that novel, but it was so intense and so excited by the whole thing.

30:29.986 --> 30:32.189
But the influences are very common.

30:33.731 --> 30:38.298
Canuck is publishing a new biography of Camus in a month or two, I noticed from there.

30:38.318 --> 30:38.879
I didn't know that.

30:38.959 --> 30:39.740
In the new catalog.

30:40.942 --> 30:41.463
By whom?

30:41.483 --> 30:42.805
By a French writer or American writer?

30:42.885 --> 30:45.249
I believe it's, I just saw it in the catalog.

30:45.289 --> 30:48.273
I haven't seen the galley or the... I'm glad to hear it.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.555
Camus is one of my heroes.

30:49.755 --> 30:51.458
And he's a...

30:51.826 --> 30:59.416
He supposedly was, when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, he supposedly thought that Kazantzakis should have won.

30:59.436 --> 31:00.297
Have you ever heard that?

31:02.020 --> 31:04.062
You are full of rumors that I don't recognize.

31:05.524 --> 31:06.386
I never heard that.

31:06.746 --> 31:07.788
I don't believe it for a moment.

31:07.808 --> 31:09.129
I don't believe it for a moment, either.

31:09.229 --> 31:12.474
I think the Greeks would like to think that.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.780
Kazantzakis is a very good writer, but I don't think I knew Everett.

31:17.340 --> 31:20.044
I heard you speak at a seminar...

31:20.412 --> 31:27.419
about 10 years ago for the Critics Circle, and you were asked by John Leonard, I think, who you read today.

31:27.459 --> 31:33.184
And you mentioned Robert Stone, I guess, as one of the contemporary writers who you admire.

31:35.266 --> 31:40.231
I wonder if I could ask you the same question 10 years later, who among contemporary writers?

31:40.251 --> 31:40.891
There are many writers.

31:41.792 --> 31:42.873
I read Robert Stone.

31:42.933 --> 31:47.718
I'm very fond of Richard Ford, people like that.

31:47.778 --> 31:50.200
Do you read contemporary?

31:50.703 --> 31:52.305
Not as much as I used to.

31:53.707 --> 31:57.251
God and American Writers, a book about the 19th century.

31:57.771 --> 32:00.795
I spent a lot of time deep in the 19th century.

32:02.097 --> 32:03.438
I don't keep up the way I used to.

32:04.920 --> 32:08.705
But your focus still, in your view, is the 19th century.

32:08.725 --> 32:09.425
No, it's not.

32:09.445 --> 32:10.206
And you've come well into it.

32:10.226 --> 32:10.767
I didn't say that.

32:10.967 --> 32:13.510
What I said was, I don't keep up the way I used to.

32:15.392 --> 32:20.018
When I'm writing now, I'm now writing a review of a new novel by...

32:21.382 --> 32:26.207
Russell Banks, a historical novel about John Brown.

32:26.227 --> 32:32.274
I read whatever I can, but I do have very strong interest in the past, you know.

32:32.855 --> 32:36.799
Do you feel that fiction must be relevant?

32:36.819 --> 32:48.672
That's a word we see thrown around by a lot of these various factions of criticism and this debate that's going on over the canon, the canon of literature.

32:48.871 --> 32:52.896
that it must be relevant to be read, especially in the academy and in schools.

32:52.916 --> 32:54.177
Do you have any thoughts on that?

32:55.259 --> 32:56.580
I don't understand what you're saying.

32:57.121 --> 32:59.023
The word relevance doesn't mean anything in here.

32:59.464 --> 33:12.259
If you're talking about the fact that there is a canon, and that's supposed to be a canon, and that lots of writers, blacks, women, homosexuals, etc., that are trying to enlarge it, that's one thing.

33:12.279 --> 33:13.501
But I don't see the word relevance.

33:14.162 --> 33:15.283
Are you saying that there are writers,

33:15.517 --> 33:17.999
who want America to be more relevant to their experience.

33:18.019 --> 33:19.180
That's what they say, not me.

33:19.921 --> 33:21.442
But yes, that's what people say.

33:21.482 --> 33:22.023
Yeah, yeah.

33:22.043 --> 33:22.884
You say, what about that?

33:22.904 --> 33:23.845
Yes, of course that goes on.

33:24.285 --> 33:25.686
After all, this is a thriving country.

33:25.706 --> 33:29.510
There are always new people coming up and saying, hey, look at me.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.571
I'm writing about the Bronx.

33:31.612 --> 33:33.033
Well, take Don DeLillo, for example.

33:33.153 --> 33:35.895
The book, he comes from the Bronx, the type of immigrant family.

33:35.915 --> 33:41.240
40, 50 years ago, there wouldn't have been that interest in a book like the books by Don DeLillo.

33:41.981 --> 33:43.262
So what is the question now that

33:43.917 --> 33:55.269
I guess I was looking for a general comment on this debate that seems to continue on canons, on literary canons.

33:55.950 --> 34:06.100
Well, the debate goes on only in, well, it doesn't interest me very much because I take it for granted that there's always an infusion of new blood and should be, you know.

34:07.001 --> 34:11.065
I represent new blood from the point of view, you know, traditional American literature.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.468
I'm the first Native American of my family.

34:13.904 --> 34:15.266
My parents didn't speak English.

34:15.927 --> 34:19.953
So that was New Blood, 1942, for me to write a book called On Native Grounds.

34:21.796 --> 34:38.863
This debate, a lot of it goes on in the university, but that part doesn't interest me at all, because the university, I don't care for academic critics who are interested mostly in sort of exhibiting what they think of as their method.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.308
My ideal critics, and I say that in many books,

34:42.743 --> 34:43.704
He's a writer like V.S.

34:43.785 --> 34:50.735
Pritchett or Edmund Wilson or a writer who just writes for the glory of reading literature and has no particular formula.

34:51.696 --> 34:55.041
Pritchett was largely self-educated from his own reading, wasn't he?

34:55.061 --> 34:55.542
Yes, he was.

34:55.582 --> 34:56.663
He was in the leather trade.

34:56.984 --> 34:58.125
He never went to university.

34:58.906 --> 35:02.872
He read my forthcoming piece in the Times Book Weekend or two.

35:02.892 --> 35:03.513
Oh, I'll read it.

35:03.934 --> 35:06.798
And he said it was his good luck because he wasn't height-bound.

35:06.818 --> 35:08.140
He wasn't kept in by anything.

35:08.881 --> 35:11.805
A lot of university people take themselves much too seriously.

35:12.680 --> 35:27.117
Well, when I hear, and as I was told, that Amherst College graduated a summa cum laude graduate and major in English literature, and this student never took a course in Shakespeare, that concerns me.

35:27.658 --> 35:28.779
It should concern you.

35:29.259 --> 35:36.448
How is it that somebody could proclaim to be proficient in English literature, not just literature?

35:36.468 --> 35:37.549
Look, look, look, look, look.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.011
I've been a professor of many colleges.

35:39.632 --> 35:42.535
A lot of colleges, just like close corporations, you know.

35:43.038 --> 35:48.783
I taught unhappily for three years.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.169
It's a place that always has formulas, formulas.

35:54.209 --> 35:59.414
When I was invited there to teach there, they had an English course.

35:59.434 --> 36:03.337
You had to prescribe that kind of semantics, and I said, I'm not interested.

36:04.138 --> 36:05.960
So I had my own share of American literature.

36:06.520 --> 36:12.606
But they didn't like me, and I didn't like them, because I was not interested in that kind of formula.

36:13.092 --> 36:18.477
One of the terrible things about universities is they always have a special idea of limitations.

36:19.538 --> 36:27.245
If there's a guy in English who never read Shakespeare, well, someone should be shot, obviously, and it's not Shakespeare.

36:27.265 --> 36:28.767
It just sort of goes on all the time.

36:28.807 --> 36:31.869
Well, it's disconcerting.

36:31.910 --> 36:39.256
We're allowing political considerations to shape conceptions of literature, and I guess... No, no, but there's a difference.

36:39.276 --> 36:39.977
There's a difference.

36:40.497 --> 36:49.285
If you are involved in a country like the United States, which is full of great political and racial problems, you can't help touching on these things.

36:50.046 --> 36:58.253
Can a black write a novel without touching on the fact that he's black and that his great-grandfather was a slave?

36:58.773 --> 36:59.274
Of course not.

36:59.334 --> 37:00.075
Of course not.

37:00.095 --> 37:07.982
It's the one thing he'll have to write about conditions the way Uncle Tom's Cabin did or Ralph Ellison did in his very good book, Invisible Man.

37:08.402 --> 37:09.323
It's something else.

37:09.657 --> 37:13.382
to say, you cannot write about this, or you cannot take Shakespeare.

37:13.663 --> 37:15.385
All that is just bunk, you know.

37:15.405 --> 37:19.211
I have to comment on Melville and the Holy Land I thought was brilliant, I have to say.

37:19.231 --> 37:19.431
Thank you.

37:19.451 --> 37:20.874
Thank you very much for writing that.

37:20.934 --> 37:21.975
Thank you very much.

37:21.995 --> 37:34.373
That allowed me, that gave me some insights that I didn't have on that writer, and that was, I wonder what inspired you to look at that, that particular aspect.

37:34.674 --> 37:38.179
Melville, everything about Melville is of the greatest interest to me.

37:39.256 --> 37:48.907
I'm trying to write a short story that is based upon actual... I'm fascinated by Melville as an old man in New York called Sailor Home from the Sea.

37:49.547 --> 37:51.149
I haven't written it yet, just thinking about it.

37:51.790 --> 37:57.656
But I would take liberties with the actual facts and present him as a man who was forgotten when he died, you know.

37:58.297 --> 37:58.738
Totally.

38:00.199 --> 38:03.983
Well, they've more than made up for that, haven't they?

38:04.003 --> 38:07.187
And, of course, Billy Budd is discovered in about 1922.

38:07.589 --> 38:10.192
It was largely a critic, I guess.

38:10.272 --> 38:20.765
It was discovered by a graduate student, Raymond Weaver, who went to Melville's granddaughter, Eleanor Metcalf, and they found the book in a bread container, that sort of thing.

38:20.785 --> 38:23.748
But Melville didn't want it published, perhaps.

38:23.808 --> 38:24.549
I don't know what he did.

38:24.970 --> 38:25.771
It's a wonderful book.

38:25.811 --> 38:27.633
It's a work of genius, of course.

38:27.653 --> 38:28.794
But he had sort of given up.

38:29.235 --> 38:33.039
Thankfully, he didn't destroy it, as he destroyed the letters he received from Hawthorne.

38:33.460 --> 38:34.301
Well, it's a different thing.

38:35.022 --> 38:36.263
He didn't destroy his own works.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.699
So he had faith, you think, in his work?

38:41.199 --> 38:43.623
No, I don't... That's a question.

38:43.643 --> 38:46.226
Look, look, you don't understand the creative process.

38:46.247 --> 38:55.560
A man like Melville, who's been a failure in the public market, he's getting old, but he's haunted by the stories about the sea, which was the big thing in his life.

38:56.461 --> 39:04.212
So he's haunted also by the erotic relationship story between Clackard, you know the book, of course, and Billy Budd.

39:04.993 --> 39:06.655
And he's writing about good and evil...

39:07.715 --> 39:11.439
Because Billy Bart is so innocent, he doesn't know what he's doing and what's happening to him.

39:12.381 --> 39:13.542
So he writes it the way you think.

39:13.622 --> 39:26.017
Your first question to me was, when I'm thinking about my career, well, people, perhaps some big bestseller writer, like who's the writer who writes these horror stories?

39:26.057 --> 39:27.058
That's Stephen King.

39:27.078 --> 39:28.640
Yeah, I guess a million or two million dollars.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.241
No, it's more than that.

39:29.301 --> 39:29.982
It's $10 million.

39:30.062 --> 39:30.663
Okay, fine.

39:31.203 --> 39:33.005
But he thinks about his career and about the money.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.127
But he's not a writer.

39:34.948 --> 39:37.671
He manufactures books and that sort of thing.

39:38.123 --> 39:40.706
But Melville was not thinking about his career.

39:40.726 --> 39:41.667
He had no career.

39:42.468 --> 39:49.015
And Faulkner was not thinking about his career when he wrote a book called The Sound of Fury, which was turned down by publisher after publisher.

39:50.276 --> 39:51.818
Writers don't think that way.

39:52.659 --> 39:56.623
I mean, only businessmen do.

39:56.643 --> 39:58.805
That's wonderful.

39:58.825 --> 39:59.166
You know what?

39:59.186 --> 40:01.048
It's ten minutes, eight minutes to twelve.

40:01.248 --> 40:02.809
Yeah.

40:02.829 --> 40:06.173
Well, I have a problem, you see, that my hip is bothering me again.

40:06.575 --> 40:11.039
I've asked all your questions honestly, haven't I?

40:11.079 --> 40:14.042
I hope I haven't annoyed you with some of the questions.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.364
Okay, so what more is there to say?

40:16.024 --> 40:17.786
Do you feel there are things still to be covered?

40:18.166 --> 40:23.091
No, I think, do you mind inscribing a book or two for me before I leave?

40:23.131 --> 40:23.211
No.

40:23.231 --> 40:25.814
May I just look briefly at my notes to see if there's anything?

40:26.234 --> 40:27.816
Do you ever handle manuscripts?

40:30.759 --> 40:35.383
Do you ever feel anything?

40:36.106 --> 40:43.559
You know, I've written about, you know, Stephen Jay Gould, for instance, as he has to handle the real thing to write, to write, he can't work.

40:43.579 --> 40:43.959
I don't understand.

40:43.979 --> 40:45.161
How can you compare me to Stephen Jay?

40:45.181 --> 40:46.764
I'm not, I'm not, but I'm a scientist.

40:46.784 --> 40:59.346
I understand what he says, but to be, to be suitably inspired by, I understand it, it's the printed book largely that you work from, but have you ever handled specific manuscripts and manuscripts?

40:59.366 --> 41:00.207
Of course I have.

41:00.406 --> 41:03.811
has given you anything that you might not have gotten from the printed book.

41:03.831 --> 41:05.113
I guess that's what I'm asking.

41:05.133 --> 41:06.755
Yes, but let that be the last question.

41:07.055 --> 41:07.356
Okay.

41:08.658 --> 41:28.405
When Mencken gave a copy of an American tragedy, of Sister Carey, excuse me, to the New York Public Library manuscript, some years ago they published the original manuscript, the original book, because the first publisher, as you must know, had been very shocked and troubled by the so-called immorality of the book.

41:29.093 --> 41:31.697
So I went to my old hangout, New York Public Library.

41:31.717 --> 41:36.503
I went to the manuscript room, and I read a lot of the original.

41:37.905 --> 41:38.586
I saw a lot of it.

41:38.626 --> 41:39.727
I wasn't surprised by anything.

41:40.448 --> 41:45.335
I was not even sure that it was right to do the whole manuscript.

41:46.557 --> 41:47.658
Things are like that, you know.

41:48.780 --> 41:54.468
Inevitably, writers I know show me manuscripts and letters, things like that.

41:54.548 --> 41:56.270
But it's not of any significance.

41:56.751 --> 41:58.493
That's the answer to the question.
