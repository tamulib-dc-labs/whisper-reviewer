00:10.831 --> 00:28.598
Let's go, same day.

00:38.833 --> 00:39.454
Good, good.

00:39.772 --> 01:06.657
Thank you.

01:10.788 --> 01:29.532
Thank you.

01:40.105 --> 01:40.305
Thank you.

01:41.483 --> 01:42.705
It's beautiful.

01:42.925 --> 01:45.609
How old is this?

01:47.011 --> 01:47.571
How many years?

01:47.591 --> 01:52.538
Twelve century.

01:57.745 --> 02:00.029
Twelve century?

02:00.049 --> 02:04.054
Twelve century.

02:04.074 --> 02:09.702
Yes, please.

02:09.682 --> 02:30.171
Thank you.

02:30.151 --> 02:43.577
So that's what I want to do.

02:43.597 --> 02:43.978
So I want to do it.

02:43.998 --> 02:44.319
I want to do it.

02:44.339 --> 02:44.920
I want to do it.

02:53.978 --> 03:03.574
Oh, my God.

03:09.905 --> 03:10.125
Oh, my God.

03:13.531 --> 03:18.619
Oh, my God.

03:18.639 --> 03:19.581
Oh, my God.

03:19.831 --> 03:24.480
Thank you.

03:31.753 --> 03:38.987
Thank you.

03:39.608 --> 03:51.865
This is such a magnificent place.

03:57.753 --> 03:59.055
The twelfth century?

03:59.075 --> 04:01.157
That is the third century.

04:01.177 --> 04:03.100
Then what's underneath is sixth.

04:03.120 --> 04:08.147
And then what's underneath that is first.

04:12.430 --> 04:18.179
How long has it been in Dominican?

04:18.199 --> 04:36.207
Since we've had it since the 60s.

04:36.227 --> 04:36.427
It's fine.

04:36.448 --> 04:37.149
Shut this.

04:37.309 --> 04:38.691
It's on the mat.

04:44.543 --> 05:04.223
A little chip.

05:11.999 --> 05:14.484
This is a solid story.

05:14.504 --> 05:18.272
One has to pause for a minute before you can think about an interview.

05:18.292 --> 05:21.959
This is quite an inspirational set of things.

05:27.490 --> 05:30.817
But under ruthless power is the Roman house.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.923
The library is in here.

06:06.742 --> 06:34.909
We had a very interesting visit to the library this morning, and Dr. Weston, who was our host, spoke so highly of your contributions to making the Vatican collections available to scholars and to new generation of scholars, and of course this is one

06:35.564 --> 07:01.791
aspect of what I would like to discuss with you in terms of, I think I explained in my book, in my letter to you, that this new book that my wife and I are working on together is an appreciation of libraries and scholarship that really is a book culture through history, but also some sort of, not necessarily illumination, but

07:02.243 --> 07:30.377
a considered speculation of where we're going with the future, discuss bibliography in a way that the general reader might get something out of it, to talk about book culture, what is this whole concept of book culture and libraries and librarians and scholars, and you touch all of these things, all of these aspects of your career, and if we could just talk generally about your experiences and your thoughts, we would love to

07:31.252 --> 07:37.423
hear your thoughts and use some of these in the sleep.

07:37.503 --> 07:49.945
Do you want to let the bike tape record by the way?

07:49.965 --> 07:55.875
You do mind.

08:50.294 --> 08:55.682
Rather, I didn't record as well.

08:55.742 --> 08:56.603
You record away.

08:56.864 --> 08:59.207
Thank you.

08:59.227 --> 09:00.349
You'll make it a lot easier for me.

09:02.031 --> 09:06.418
Okay.

09:06.438 --> 09:09.362
I'm sure we're running.

09:09.382 --> 09:09.963
There it goes.

09:11.325 --> 09:12.867
We're talking with Brother Boyle.

09:14.430 --> 09:18.175
Um, maybe a good place to start is, um,

09:19.471 --> 09:21.354
with something that we just discussed.

09:21.374 --> 09:29.725
You are credited with opening the hold, the magnificent holdings of the Vatican Library to scholars.

09:29.745 --> 09:47.250
I also read something that you wrote, I found it on the internet as a matter of fact, where you stated your belief that libraries should not be cemeteries where manuscripts and books are deposited and then forgotten.

09:47.855 --> 09:52.742
I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your thoughts on that.

09:53.183 --> 09:54.205
Hmm.

09:54.225 --> 09:56.548
On internet.

09:56.568 --> 10:01.415
I don't remember, but anyway.

10:01.435 --> 10:16.478
That's largely because there was a period between about 1750 and I suppose you can say 1870.

10:17.960 --> 10:29.056
then the library, the Vatican Library was very little used and there was very little approach to it.

10:29.116 --> 10:47.882
And a Spanish Jesuit called Juan Andres, A-N-D-R-E-S Juan Andres paid a visit and he said that the

10:49.448 --> 11:18.240
library, everything was jealously guarded and that the place was more a cenotaph than a library, which reminded me of what Ammianus Marcellinus said about the year 380 of the libraries in Rome in the year

11:18.440 --> 11:35.758
of the opening, when everything was breaking down and the libraries were, some closed, some were turned into theatres with hydraulic organs.

11:35.778 --> 11:46.489
And the phrase he used was, enclosed with a sepulchral rite, like sepulchres.

11:47.988 --> 11:51.934
So, that's what I was talking about, what is behind all of this.

11:52.936 --> 12:13.489
That if we're not, the library is not open properly, not everything made available, people made welcome, people helped, then we might as well turn it all into a mausoleum and sort of wave in a steady mountain.

12:14.650 --> 12:31.857
Do you believe that manuscripts, it has been said, for instance, about the study of Shakespeare or Dante, that every generation should have a new edition of Shakespeare or a new edition of Dante, that maybe every generation should have a new focus, a new look at the essential text.

12:32.558 --> 12:35.122
Do you feel the same way about many of these manuscripts?

12:35.342 --> 12:39.529
Do they require constant study and evaluation and re-evaluation?

12:39.809 --> 12:40.270
Oh, yes.

12:41.161 --> 12:46.006
because we all view things differently from generation to generation.

12:47.727 --> 12:52.312
And the next generation after this one will probably be looking for things we haven't thought of.

12:53.913 --> 12:59.278
And so there must be a constant review in that sense.

13:00.179 --> 13:10.189
Oh look, you have 150,000 manuscripts in the Vatican Library, obviously.

13:10.996 --> 13:16.904
You're not going to have these reviewed every generation, but certain areas will be reviewed.

13:18.146 --> 13:23.734
And certain areas will interest people more than others, from generation to generation.

13:25.536 --> 13:27.799
And that's the way things go on.

13:28.040 --> 13:38.995
I mean, just in the Times Literary Supplement, this weekend I was reading about, what, five new editions of Shakespeare?

13:41.135 --> 13:55.431
and the evaluation of each one of them, including what is called the Oxford Shakespeare, which, honestly, I don't know the Oxford text, which appears to be the one that's regarded most highly.

13:56.972 --> 14:01.517
And now somebody has produced a new version based on the Oxford text.

14:03.079 --> 14:08.745
So all of that sort of thing, since you did mention Shakespeare, is going on all the time, indeed.

14:09.350 --> 14:13.715
And that is an ongoing process, an ongoing way.

14:15.177 --> 14:17.219
That's normally how scholarship works.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.244
Do you have any anxieties?

14:21.604 --> 14:26.450
You have committed so much of your life to the study of texts, medieval texts.

14:28.332 --> 14:31.415
There's all this talk about computerization.

14:33.157 --> 14:38.243
People, it is feared, are steering away from textual scholarship.

14:38.459 --> 14:45.971
Do you have any anxiety about whether or not there will be people, such as Bader Boyle, to follow in your footsteps to do this?

14:45.991 --> 14:47.954
I don't have any anxiety.

14:48.135 --> 14:49.276
I'm 74.

14:50.639 --> 14:55.587
And I mean, whatever I've got left, it's not going to happen in my time.

14:57.069 --> 15:02.678
What's going to happen afterwards, when we're all gone, is another thing.

15:04.345 --> 15:20.308
And in the past few weeks I've read a few articles here and there on the future of libraries, including one very texty one in the Times Literary Supplement about two weeks ago.

15:20.588 --> 15:21.189
Check it out.

15:23.292 --> 15:31.804
Yes, on just running down the whole idea, or poo-pooing the whole idea that libraries are finished.

15:33.033 --> 15:37.400
Libraries haven't finished and won't be finished.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.665
I mean, I've got, I'm the end room down there.

15:42.288 --> 15:47.817
And I've got chocolate.

15:47.837 --> 15:48.998
I watched it, by the way.

15:49.038 --> 15:57.993
Pretty stunning.

15:58.013 --> 16:00.677
And, um, okay.

16:01.957 --> 16:14.788
I can bring up the Vatican Library computer and I can consult the card catalog and stuff from the Bodleian Library.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.511
It's very select.

16:18.531 --> 16:21.774
At this stage it's no more than showing off what you can do.

16:21.814 --> 16:27.039
That's great.

16:27.059 --> 16:31.963
And the thing I was involved with IBM in

16:33.108 --> 16:34.370
of digitalization.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.432
Did they talk about that today?

16:36.452 --> 16:37.934
Yes, I've read about it myself, actually.

16:38.735 --> 16:38.975
Yes.

16:40.177 --> 16:55.675
I mean, that is a wonderful thing, particularly because you can actually clean the texts where they've been bleeding in a manuscript, especially a paper manuscript where the ink bleeds through to the other side.

16:56.756 --> 17:02.203
You can, by digitalization, you can wipe out all of that and get what's written.

17:02.605 --> 17:06.009
where it's a blotch now, get it clear.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.713
And it's wonderful.

17:09.733 --> 17:23.728
Now, before I left the library, I think we had done something around 22,000 pages of manuscripts, I think.

17:26.311 --> 17:31.296
And I, for the fun of it, would bring it up on the screen in my office.

17:32.744 --> 17:36.549
I haven't bothered here.

17:36.569 --> 17:41.115
I would find it extremely tiresome to be reading a manuscript that way.

17:41.776 --> 17:44.520
I would download it and read it.

17:46.823 --> 17:47.704
Yes.

17:47.724 --> 18:01.182
I get the London Times on the computer in the morning, the Irish Times from Dublin, the local newspaper from my hometown where he's from too, Paul Lawler, who's the archaeologist here,

18:04.604 --> 18:05.905
I flick my eye over them.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.248
If there's anything interesting, I don't fit and read them.

18:09.268 --> 18:12.311
I don't want to put it on the desk.

18:12.391 --> 18:25.464
I mean, that business of the physical eye contact, which is combined with the physical manual contact, is I think absolutely essential.

18:26.925 --> 18:34.392
And that anybody will get beyond this and have little sort of capsules that come out of the screen

18:35.350 --> 18:39.914
and implant itself into our head or our ear or something.

18:39.934 --> 18:42.576
And then it's all read for us.

18:42.596 --> 18:48.962
Well, okay, if we want automatons around, that's fine.

18:48.982 --> 18:53.906
And we can construct these to wash the dishes or something.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.649
Or even to fetch books as they had in some places.

18:57.710 --> 18:59.912
But I think we have to read them.

19:01.193 --> 19:03.535
How essential do you feel it is to work with

19:03.700 --> 19:06.724
with the actual document as opposed to facsimiles?

19:08.966 --> 19:12.150
That's a very sensitive point.

19:14.473 --> 19:23.403
Indeed, because... Where did I see it a few days ago?

19:23.423 --> 19:25.305
But my own experience is enough.

19:26.647 --> 19:30.231
Facsimiles are fine, just like photographs.

19:30.251 --> 19:31.092
And I worked.

19:32.759 --> 19:37.003
I worked first in the Bodleian Library doing my own work.

19:38.144 --> 19:45.551
And when I left the Bodleian Library and came here to Rome in 1955, naturally I couldn't bring the manuscripts with me.

19:46.571 --> 19:52.577
But all that I needed, I got photographs of.

19:52.597 --> 20:01.585
And I remember going back, oh, five, six, seven years later, to the Bodleian Library, just to check something when I was in Oxford.

20:02.662 --> 20:07.427
I'd forgotten what a manuscript looked like, and how different it was from the photograph.

20:10.570 --> 20:32.010
And when I came here, just one straight example, when I came here in 1984 to the Vatican Library, my very first few weeks, I got a text in for a publication on which a scholar had been working for some years.

20:32.125 --> 20:35.809
And I read the introduction.

20:37.231 --> 20:42.937
The text is one manuscript only, it's not a hundred manuscripts, one manuscript.

20:42.957 --> 20:48.864
I read the introduction and I was puzzled by something in it.

20:48.884 --> 20:51.967
Because he had quoted a marginal note.

20:52.508 --> 20:58.234
I said, this seems to go against everything that I ever heard of.

20:59.699 --> 21:05.448
So I went downstairs and got the manuscript, brought it up, sat with it.

21:05.468 --> 21:10.295
And I said, oh my god, he's been working from the microfilm.

21:10.315 --> 21:17.606
And the microfilm doesn't get into what they call the gutter in here.

21:17.626 --> 21:22.433
So you've got half the footnote, half the margin of note, which made perfect sense.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.820
But it wasn't the sense when you read it.

21:28.910 --> 21:35.136
They say always, oh, this will mean now that manuscripts will be handled less.

21:35.557 --> 21:38.740
You can put them away, reverence them.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.483
We've now got them in digitalized form, what have you.

21:43.085 --> 21:56.098
I believe that when they start giving you smell and the feel of the greens of people who use the manuscripts over the years.

21:57.935 --> 22:02.541
I made those manuscripts live, allied and living.

22:05.164 --> 22:14.315
So, I mean, I think digitalization is absolutely wonderful, and I think the whole thing is wonderful, provided you put it in its place.

22:15.716 --> 22:17.679
And they are living for you, is that correct?

22:17.799 --> 22:18.340
Oh Lord, yes.

22:19.641 --> 22:24.567
Yes, yes, I always used to joke about teaching.

22:29.423 --> 22:38.997
And I would say, look, it's a dead animal and it loves being stroked.

22:39.017 --> 22:39.759
That's for parchment.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.723
Paper is a different thing.

22:43.364 --> 22:47.871
I never liked the smell of paper, but I do like the feel of parchment.

22:47.891 --> 22:55.062
And especially, people would say, but aren't you afraid to grease from your fingers and so on?

22:56.384 --> 22:58.587
Just look at that, open the

22:58.921 --> 23:02.185
See the grease down there around the sign?

23:02.205 --> 23:09.234
That proves to me this dead animal was loved by somebody who read it.

23:09.254 --> 23:14.922
If I find one that's virgin, it's a coffee table book.

23:14.962 --> 23:19.828
So give it to the local dentist for his waiting book.

23:19.848 --> 23:26.937
But on the other hand, do you think that maybe there are some, to continue the metaphor, of the virgin book that hasn't been touched,

23:27.271 --> 23:31.638
that there are untapped treasures waiting to be discovered that have been overlooked?

23:32.198 --> 23:32.920
Quite possibly.

23:34.482 --> 23:39.169
Not, I would say, in the Vatican Library.

23:39.269 --> 23:43.656
I would think that somewhere or other most people have seen most things.

23:44.577 --> 23:53.110
But, see, a manuscript is rarely, well, very often a manuscript is not a single word.

23:53.967 --> 23:57.513
It may have ten different treatises under the same cover.

23:58.615 --> 24:00.238
And Jack Smith comes along.

24:00.258 --> 24:03.703
He's interested just in those ten folios there.

24:04.525 --> 24:06.208
He never looks at the rest.

24:06.228 --> 24:11.336
So you can say, oh yes, that manuscript has been seen by Jack Smith in 1930.

24:11.436 --> 24:15.042
So it's known already.

24:16.845 --> 24:20.211
It's not a fatal error.

24:20.714 --> 24:27.202
The other nine may be absolutely splendid things in which he wasn't in a slight bit.

24:27.222 --> 24:33.610
Like a classical scholar will come along because here's fifteen folios of Seneca.

24:34.751 --> 24:37.154
That's what he's working on.

24:37.174 --> 24:48.088
But there may be a dozen Renaissance treatises in there, or a work of Thomas Aquinas, all under the same cover in what they call

24:49.165 --> 24:52.688
composite volume or a volume with booklets.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.390
And these booklets had even different centuries.

24:55.291 --> 24:58.954
And some bright librarian didn't like them lying around.

24:59.535 --> 25:02.677
So he said, let's put all the ones of the same size together.

25:03.899 --> 25:06.781
Oh, more or less, that's what happens.

25:06.801 --> 25:09.704
And that's part of the joy of the thing.

25:09.724 --> 25:15.289
Have you had epiphanous moments like this in discovery where you found things like that?

25:15.830 --> 25:15.910
Yes.

25:15.930 --> 25:17.451
I was working on

25:19.203 --> 25:34.285
The thing I was working on for my doctoral thesis at Oxford, and I had tracked down, I don't know, sixty, seventy manuscripts of what at the start we thought was one surviving manuscript.

25:35.486 --> 25:39.071
By poking around I find sixty copies in existence.

25:39.091 --> 25:40.674
Sixty.

25:40.694 --> 25:48.585
And another, ah, another thirty or forty listed in medieval inventories, but not necessarily existing.

25:50.270 --> 25:55.377
And one of these stout, rather ugly volumes.

26:00.684 --> 26:04.769
I found a copy there.

26:05.610 --> 26:06.171
I read it.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.718
And I never, I never read only what I was interested in.

26:13.661 --> 26:15.844
I'm a magpie in many ways.

26:15.864 --> 26:16.285
A magpie.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.447
I love it.

26:18.467 --> 26:19.669
And I go around

26:20.358 --> 26:23.582
picking and poking.

26:23.602 --> 26:45.370
So I read through it, from beginning to end, and I found a curious little, what was it, eight, nine folios, on uneven parchment, like you know the way if you take an envelope and write on it, or

26:46.987 --> 26:49.571
a bit of leather lying around in your right eye.

26:49.591 --> 26:50.272
This is what happened.

26:51.174 --> 26:56.322
So it began something like, here I am in prison.

26:56.562 --> 27:02.431
So I found the man's name half-ways down.

27:03.613 --> 27:13.168
But this man must be called Amori, A-M-A-U-R-Y, but written in the Latin form of Alma Luricus.

27:13.188 --> 27:14.530
He's in prison somewhere.

27:16.872 --> 27:34.490
Now I didn't know all that much about English history, and the name Amalwikis didn't mean anything to me, but there was a great old gentleman who was doing his biographical register at the University of Oxford, A. B. Endon.

27:38.694 --> 27:39.875
Great man.

27:39.895 --> 27:43.639
And Endon would always stop as he was passing by.

27:44.159 --> 27:46.662
and saying, now what is it?

27:47.563 --> 27:51.488
Because he maintained I'd never finished since I was a magpie.

27:53.150 --> 27:59.959
And I said, Mr. Emden, does the name Amalricus mean anything to you?

27:59.979 --> 28:06.387
It does to me, I said, but it's the philosopher Amalricus de Bebe, the beginning of the century.

28:06.407 --> 28:08.049
I said, this is later.

28:08.069 --> 28:11.213
And this Amalricus is in present.

28:11.733 --> 28:30.073
He said, I only know of one other Amal Regis, the son of Simon de Montfort, the great Baron, son of Simon de Montfort, who was in prison for a while.

28:30.113 --> 28:37.842
Sure, he thought he was going to be killed, and it's his last confession, it's his confession, done on the scraps of paper.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.006
They just found the attachments that were there.

28:43.268 --> 28:55.564
They got into, and not alone that, but then I discovered that the volume had been put together at the prison, because there was a monastery next door to it.

28:55.584 --> 28:58.728
And the monks there had got this stuff.

28:58.748 --> 28:59.589
Found it all in.

29:00.390 --> 29:03.674
Had nothing to do with it.

29:03.754 --> 29:05.837
And I wrote a long article on it.

29:06.053 --> 29:07.815
And where did you publish that?

29:07.835 --> 29:10.379
I'd love to check that out in Harvard.

29:10.559 --> 29:13.764
Oh dear.

29:13.784 --> 29:15.226
Do you remember the title of the piece?

29:15.366 --> 29:26.101
Oh, it's called The Catena et Carcere, from Out of the Chains and Prison, because he uses that.

29:26.121 --> 29:30.567
I am writing with my prison.

29:30.587 --> 29:33.030
And this you discovered through serendipity.

29:34.252 --> 29:34.412
Oh yeah.

29:34.432 --> 29:34.913
Curiosity.

29:36.142 --> 29:36.863
Ninety-five.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.387
And how long had this been waiting to be discovered?

29:40.828 --> 29:42.370
What was his period?

29:42.390 --> 29:44.172
Twelve.

29:44.192 --> 29:45.474
Seventy.

29:45.494 --> 29:45.974
Seven.

29:45.994 --> 29:46.655
I get grease pimples now.

29:46.895 --> 29:47.576
Twelve?

29:47.596 --> 29:52.803
Seven hundred years had been waiting to be discovered.

29:52.823 --> 29:53.664
Twelve seventy-seven.

29:53.684 --> 29:54.305
Let me see.

29:54.325 --> 29:56.047
I don't remember the name of the book now.

29:56.808 --> 30:03.516
This cover has been avoided in honor of a man that taught me.

30:08.542 --> 30:09.803
You put your hands right on it.

30:09.923 --> 30:16.410
I'm just going to take down the info, medieval learning and literature.

30:20.915 --> 30:34.650
Well, there is discussion in the United States, and of course, I'm sure this does not apply... Oh, by the way, just before we go on, the business about the white clubs and the rest of it and me, that's fine for the margins.

30:34.670 --> 30:37.873
I never allow anybody to put their hands...

30:38.174 --> 30:39.015
from the text.

30:41.137 --> 30:42.178
That's very important.

30:42.198 --> 30:45.521
I would cut their heads off.

30:45.541 --> 30:46.302
Oh, no, no, no.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.926
Unless anyone would think that this is a terrible casual way.

30:50.106 --> 30:58.134
No, I mean that manuscripts are there to be used, but not at least.

31:00.556 --> 31:02.038
But very definitely to be used.

31:02.518 --> 31:04.640
Oh, no.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.303
Of course, this doesn't really apply to manuscripts, which are unique.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.071
But there's discussion in many of the universities.

31:11.213 --> 31:27.297
And I'm also paying a great deal of attention to university libraries, particularly in the United States, where if a book hasn't been used in three or four or five years, they're looking at it to decide whether or not it should be kept, whether or not it should be deaccessioned.

31:29.219 --> 31:37.071
Again, I realize this is not manuscripts, but do you have any thoughts on that, on the thinking that goes into that kind of

31:37.726 --> 31:45.313
Well, that is the generation syndrome.

31:45.333 --> 31:54.041
That is because it isn't of interest to me or those in the last five years, therefore it's not of interest.

31:57.484 --> 32:06.552
If libraries had worked on that principle, one like the Vatican Library,

32:07.983 --> 32:21.434
We would be deprived of all sorts of stuff which probably is used once every hundred years and without which we'd be utterly lost.

32:21.454 --> 32:26.799
So I do not subscribe in any way to anything like that.

32:26.819 --> 32:35.666
Different thing if there are five copies of a textbook or something and the textbook has gone out of use.

32:36.827 --> 32:37.568
Then at least

32:38.223 --> 32:52.651
I was the two best copies, because they are witnesses to what was informing people in a certain period.

32:53.553 --> 32:54.615
English grammar.

32:56.218 --> 32:58.763
In September, I was out in San Francisco.

32:59.165 --> 33:03.771
which, as you know, their public library, they just opened, and there was quite a controversy there.

33:03.791 --> 33:04.392
So there was.

33:04.412 --> 33:05.654
I read an article about it.

33:05.774 --> 33:08.718
I knew the... Nicholson Baker, as a matter of fact.

33:08.778 --> 33:15.306
I interviewed him, and he said that she performed at his wedding, and in fact said to say hello to you, by the way.

33:15.346 --> 33:25.780
I must remember to say hello to you on behalf of Nicholson Baker, Lucy Gordon, who we were with this morning, and Michael Giacalone at the...

33:26.232 --> 33:28.976
Italian Embassy in Washington.

33:28.996 --> 33:30.818
Ah, yes, yes.

33:30.938 --> 33:34.383
So I have to say hello to you on behalf of all of these people.

33:34.443 --> 33:36.025
I've forgotten about him, yes.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.909
Apparently his mother works here in Rome.

33:38.989 --> 33:39.910
She does.

33:39.930 --> 33:43.815
And I've been asked to remember them to you.

33:43.855 --> 33:44.957
Fine, fine.

33:45.898 --> 33:46.879
Now you were interested.

33:46.899 --> 33:47.920
Yes, we were talking about San Francisco.

33:47.940 --> 33:52.627
Well, the piece that you mentioned that Nicholson Baker wrote, the story actually goes beyond that.

33:53.227 --> 33:55.210
When they opened the new library, they had

33:55.460 --> 33:58.983
less shelf space in the new facility than they had in the older one.

33:59.864 --> 34:08.813
And there were as many as 200,000 books, 200,000 books, which they very quietly sent off to a landfill, disposed of.

34:09.594 --> 34:17.121
And what disturbs me is not only did they send off the books, but they didn't even record the titles of the books.

34:17.962 --> 34:21.265
And I think it kind of feeds into what you were just saying, a witness to

34:21.633 --> 34:26.257
Wouldn't it be interesting to know what books were of interest, even if you're getting rid of the books?

34:26.377 --> 34:38.108
What was available to the people in San Francisco, the library there, from the years, shall we say, 1925 to 1990, or something like that.

34:38.729 --> 34:41.511
And at least to ever retain the title.

34:42.272 --> 34:44.093
At least to have retained the title.

34:44.114 --> 34:49.058
And they were boasting quite a lot when they were doing

34:50.185 --> 34:55.432
working on that new library about how to be all automated and what have you.

34:55.452 --> 35:10.452
And I remember, you know, saying, well, automation is wonderful if you've got something in it, but just because you have computers around the place or terminals doesn't mean you have got all that you have is now available by title.

35:10.472 --> 35:17.061
If they had gone and done that, put all the titles into the computer before they disposed of them.

35:17.081 --> 35:19.264
I am not in any way blessing their

35:20.223 --> 35:22.065
they're taking this stuff to the dump.

35:23.446 --> 35:33.837
I, when I came here in 1955 to San Clemente, that library you saw downstairs, I rearranged it.

35:33.857 --> 35:41.365
All just, I was doing my doctorate at the time, and to keep myself going mad, I used to go down and work in the library.

35:42.306 --> 35:47.631
And just flipping around, I put in the railing cup.

35:48.995 --> 35:50.537
one or two things like that done.

35:51.638 --> 35:57.343
And under the flat roof here, I was poking around.

35:59.105 --> 36:02.869
Night-time fashion again, just poking around.

36:02.889 --> 36:10.397
And I came across 110 volumes that is rather nice finding.

36:10.417 --> 36:14.401
And I said, damn it, this is nice finding at least.

36:15.101 --> 36:16.723
The book doesn't look as any useful.

36:17.125 --> 36:25.876
But it looked nice on the shelf, you know, as a bit of a show-off when we polished the banks.

36:27.498 --> 36:32.605
So I got them out.

36:34.607 --> 36:41.436
I got them out, found that the whole series was intact with four index volumes.

36:41.456 --> 36:45.141
And it was a dictionary done

36:46.150 --> 36:49.835
Well, an insectopedia rather than dictionary, done about 1840.

36:51.858 --> 36:59.048
And I cleaned the bags just for the bundle and said, where will we put these now?

36:59.068 --> 37:03.173
They're actually in the boss's room down at the end here.

37:03.193 --> 37:06.338
He has them nicely there in a big bookcase.

37:07.319 --> 37:13.187
And he hasn't the slightest interest, but he says, they do look nice.

37:13.927 --> 37:29.793
But I mentioned it to a friend of mine one day, and there comes this curious encyclopedia called Encyclopedia Ecclesiastica.

37:29.813 --> 37:40.170
And he said, you know, I said, look, I think it's Moroni, M-O-R-O-N-I,

37:45.027 --> 37:50.992
I said, yes, come to the platform.

37:51.012 --> 37:58.079
He said, I've been going over to the Vatican Library for years, consulting that.

37:58.099 --> 38:00.781
Oh, it's worth watching, actually.

38:01.562 --> 38:05.946
So for a long time it was there, but they've changed the whole place.

38:05.966 --> 38:08.608
Now it's all been repainted, new lighting and so on.

38:09.609 --> 38:12.992
And we had ready reference

38:13.799 --> 38:16.782
three ready reference shelves there.

38:16.802 --> 38:20.326
And this was in the centerpiece.

38:20.346 --> 38:23.650
But the prior liked the bit of furniture and took the whole lot into his room.

38:24.531 --> 38:28.395
And I'm glad they're in there, out of the way.

38:29.356 --> 38:32.359
So there was a bit of serendipity again.

38:35.763 --> 38:42.490
But throw them out, if you want to, but for heaven's sake at least,

38:43.769 --> 38:52.260
I wonder, for a little bit of biographical background, were you drawn to scholarship before the priesthood or the priesthood?

38:52.280 --> 38:57.587
I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the chronology there.

38:57.607 --> 39:10.924
Well, apart from about three mad weeks when I wanted to be a meteorological officer at Shannon Airport when I was forty,

39:12.541 --> 39:17.728
I wanted to be a priest and a teacher.

39:17.748 --> 39:22.575
Okay, other things would have been fine, but I always had the teaching thing.

39:24.377 --> 39:25.058
Research?

39:25.960 --> 39:26.360
No.

39:26.601 --> 39:29.705
I mean, I wouldn't have known quite what research was.

39:31.668 --> 39:42.042
But after my first or second year in the Dominican Order, I began to poke around.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.360
the whole medieval side.

39:44.400 --> 39:49.266
What I really wanted to do was to be a biblical archaeologist.

39:51.890 --> 40:01.642
And I read extremely widely in all sorts of themes relative to Egypt, the Middle East, to all the discoveries.

40:03.825 --> 40:11.775
We did Hebrew, so I did a little bit of one or two other languages.

40:13.291 --> 40:30.247
And then one day I came across an article in a French magazine, well, French magazine, French journal, it's heavy, and on, I've got no words about it.

40:30.267 --> 40:42.538
So I wrote an article for the student journal at the time, on the Dominicans at the University of Paris or so, in its, when it got out.

40:44.206 --> 40:47.750
the 1220s.

40:47.771 --> 40:48.652
In the 1220s.

40:48.872 --> 40:53.358
And I wrote it in Gaelic.

40:53.998 --> 40:55.981
You wrote this in Gaelic?

40:56.061 --> 41:00.547
Oh yes, it was my first sort of language.

41:00.567 --> 41:09.899
And somebody or other said, so you want to be a biblical archaeologist?

41:12.342 --> 41:13.403
Forget about it.

41:14.665 --> 41:18.830
you should become a medievalist.

41:19.630 --> 41:31.884
So they sent me over to the Dominicans of Oxford in 1947, 15 years ago.

41:31.904 --> 41:36.088
And so that's where I got interested, began to work and so on.

41:36.549 --> 41:39.772
But I taught paleography, the study of manuscripts.

41:40.253 --> 41:43.997
I had nothing to do with libraries, our library economy.

41:44.737 --> 41:45.838
in the wide world.

41:46.759 --> 41:50.944
Yes, I fiddled with the library here, but I was lucky.

41:50.964 --> 42:01.336
Until I came to the Vatican Library in 1984 and found that I was head of the School of Library Science.

42:01.356 --> 42:03.578
I went about twice a year.

42:03.598 --> 42:05.801
Bless them all.

42:07.022 --> 42:10.806
And I generally encouraged them.

42:10.886 --> 42:13.309
I gave them one or two lectures on telegraphy

42:14.858 --> 42:15.799
keep my hand in.

42:17.562 --> 42:19.885
But I knew nothing about library economy.

42:21.848 --> 42:23.931
And I know less now.

42:23.951 --> 42:28.417
But I did at least not discourage it.

42:28.437 --> 42:33.164
When you say library economy, you mean... The running of the library.

42:33.204 --> 42:37.230
Do you find them antithetical in terms of scholarship?

42:37.370 --> 42:37.691
Oh, no, no, no.

42:38.572 --> 42:42.958
But just managing a library has distinct from using a library.

42:43.951 --> 42:52.321
I've heard it said, you know, tongue-in-cheek by some people that the greatest enemy of the scholar is the librarian.

42:52.981 --> 42:54.924
Ah, well, that's a lot of tosh.

42:54.964 --> 43:06.277
But it so happens that some librarians begin to regard the books after they've been around twenty years or something.

43:06.297 --> 43:07.899
It's almost their own property.

43:09.180 --> 43:13.485
And they develop kinky approaches like

43:13.735 --> 43:29.877
a famous librarian whom I came to know later on, who in my youth was reputed in a certain Italian library, who hadn't a chance of getting me to see the manuscript.

43:29.897 --> 43:37.647
Not a chance, unless you brought her a bokeh flower and then you got it.

43:40.050 --> 43:43.675
So I used to, doing paleography and talking about

43:44.077 --> 43:48.202
where manuscripts were, I said, the first thing you do is inform yourself.

43:48.282 --> 43:49.524
Not about the opening hours.

43:50.685 --> 43:51.567
Do that too.

43:53.269 --> 43:55.211
Find out who is the librarian.

43:55.451 --> 44:00.418
What is the librarian in your sink?

44:03.742 --> 44:08.548
Does he or she like this?

44:10.170 --> 44:13.915
I never thought of that one.

44:14.806 --> 44:18.110
I never thought of that.

44:19.611 --> 44:24.197
Because, you know, if this is a barrier, then it should be broken down.

44:25.598 --> 44:38.753
But the... I've never found librarians anywhere that I've worked with, anywhere possessive in that sense, all being a barrier.

44:39.835 --> 44:42.678
They get worried that you're going to damage them.

44:42.878 --> 44:44.560
And that's fair enough.

44:46.058 --> 44:52.745
But I'm afraid I survived for 13 years in the Vatican Library because I never allowed anything like that to worry me.

44:55.448 --> 45:06.619
Ninety-nine percent of the readers in a specialized library like the Vatican Library are professors, professional researchers.

45:06.639 --> 45:08.041
They're not blowouts.

45:08.061 --> 45:09.763
That's right.

45:09.783 --> 45:15.829
And they, if they can't trust them, say, let's get a staff and have

45:16.298 --> 45:19.482
one person sits beside each reader.

45:19.502 --> 45:29.833
And since we used to have about a heavy period in June, there'd be 201 or 202 readers.

45:29.853 --> 45:37.321
It'd be in a bad way if you had to have 201 or 202 assistants sitting beside them.

45:37.341 --> 45:38.703
Oh, I was in one library.

45:39.604 --> 45:42.407
We'll not specify the city or the continent.

45:43.653 --> 45:56.210
It took me a long time to get permission to see this manuscript.

45:56.230 --> 46:06.123
Finally I got two people, one either side, and I was only allowed to look at what I had said in my letter I wanted to look at.

46:06.143 --> 46:11.230
Yeah, I was studying a certain thing, it was there, but the concept that

46:11.412 --> 46:15.617
In order to study that one, you had to give a description of the old manuscript.

46:15.637 --> 46:16.698
That was for the prayers.

46:17.519 --> 46:19.141
That's unbelievable.

46:19.161 --> 46:22.325
So you could only look at that little fragment that you requested.

46:22.345 --> 46:24.868
And then did you ask them if you could see something else?

46:24.888 --> 46:25.329
I said no.

46:26.350 --> 46:27.531
That's all you asked to see.

46:28.593 --> 46:32.718
And the rationale behind this being that this was going to... Well, they were in a hurry.

46:35.922 --> 46:40.407
Oh, that's... I have to say, let me also...

46:40.657 --> 46:45.523
stress that this new book will be a pain in many respects to librarians.

46:45.603 --> 46:48.806
I love librarians.

46:49.187 --> 46:53.412
They're among the fewest people in the world who want you to borrow things.

46:54.313 --> 47:02.182
Richard William Hunt was the manuscript librarian at the Bodleian in my time.

47:02.202 --> 47:04.124
Justly famous, actually.

47:04.144 --> 47:06.467
A wonderful man.

47:06.487 --> 47:09.010
And he couldn't have been more helpful to lead

47:09.800 --> 47:14.345
Every morning when he'd come in, he'd go around to all of us working there.

47:15.906 --> 47:25.256
We were all graduate students doing theses and he'd go around to each one of us and say, any great discovery?

47:25.276 --> 47:29.540
He'd say, why are you using that manuscript?

47:34.505 --> 47:37.428
On one occasion he said to me, I said, I found it's got the stuff I'm working on.

47:37.448 --> 47:38.389
He said, how can you read it?

47:40.158 --> 47:41.660
What is it?

47:41.680 --> 47:44.645
He said, it's bound too tightly.

47:44.665 --> 47:50.173
Can't read that.

47:50.193 --> 47:51.455
It needed binding.

47:52.636 --> 47:53.978
It needed binding.

47:53.998 --> 47:56.382
So he just assured the fact that it would be re-bound.

47:57.464 --> 48:02.932
It should never have been bound like that.

48:03.152 --> 48:04.914
It's a recent binding.

48:05.075 --> 48:06.777
I mean, recent in the last 100 years.

48:06.797 --> 48:08.680
It wasn't a contemporary one.

48:10.718 --> 48:17.204
Did you find sometimes that some of the most important discoveries are on the marginalia, are on the annotations?

48:18.385 --> 48:19.706
Oh, yes, yes.

48:19.807 --> 48:22.269
This manuscript of St.

48:22.349 --> 48:40.506
Thomas Aquinas, of his second commentary on the sentences of Peter Lombard, which had been discovered, oh, maybe 30, 40 years ago, and rejected by

48:43.540 --> 48:45.802
the people working on the critical edition of St.

48:45.822 --> 48:48.425
Thomas, of which I'm now president.

48:49.006 --> 48:50.888
I want to talk about that, by the way, William.

48:50.908 --> 48:53.671
Which is a funny turnaround.

48:53.731 --> 48:59.197
And I read the article rejecting this.

49:01.319 --> 49:05.244
I couldn't have cared less about being rejected.

49:08.667 --> 49:12.872
But I had to come back to it twice in order to make sure my footnote was right.

49:13.358 --> 49:19.145
They were just a footman saying, this is not so common.

49:19.165 --> 49:24.111
And on each occasion I came away, I returned it to the library shelf uneasily.

49:25.052 --> 49:26.274
There's something wrong in here.

49:29.177 --> 49:35.585
And then I was in the library, my office was over there, so I had to cross the canopy.

49:35.605 --> 49:41.492
The third time I was walking away from the library and I said, he's got it back to front.

49:43.683 --> 49:48.248
got it back to France.

49:48.268 --> 49:53.455
I went back and read his article again.

49:53.475 --> 49:55.437
And I said, yeah, he's got it back to France.

49:56.258 --> 50:03.947
Then, the following summer, I was in Oxford for a conference.

50:03.967 --> 50:12.777
And I nipped away from the conference to the Bodleian Library to see this manuscript.

50:12.797 --> 50:13.318
And

50:16.893 --> 50:24.842
looked at it, went through, and found a margin which he had never quoted.

50:24.862 --> 50:29.487
The man who had done the article.

50:29.507 --> 50:34.052
And I said, good heavens, he never saw the manuscript.

50:34.072 --> 50:36.935
He was working from a microphone.

50:36.955 --> 50:45.465
And it said, on this point, Brother Thomas says,

50:46.998 --> 50:52.405
that, okay, they hold this at Paris at the moment, but he personally doesn't agree.

50:55.970 --> 51:03.400
That goes back to the earlier discussion about the authentic document as opposed to the facsimile.

51:04.662 --> 51:13.854
Because whoever, you know, a man who's microfilming is a cameraman, photographer.

51:13.874 --> 51:15.216
He doesn't know what you want.

51:16.192 --> 51:23.582
He thinks all you need is the text, not the whole opening as we call it.

51:23.602 --> 51:28.269
So none of the marginal notes were included, only the text.

51:30.211 --> 51:31.633
And it made all the difference in the world.

51:32.474 --> 51:33.276
So it was St.

51:33.316 --> 51:33.836
Thomas.

51:33.876 --> 51:34.998
It was in your view.

51:35.078 --> 51:36.420
Yes, yes.

51:38.222 --> 51:42.368
I now have the text ready for publication.

51:43.124 --> 51:48.951
Nobody can stop me now, you see, since I'm president of this.

51:48.971 --> 51:52.816
Because, oh, the skepticism when I did this in 1918.

51:52.836 --> 51:55.680
One, I think it was.

51:57.783 --> 51:59.605
Oh, the skepticism.

51:59.645 --> 52:11.260
The journal I wanted to be published in said, no, no, I mean, you're going against that great man, et cetera, et cetera.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.962
So they sent it to the great man.

52:14.680 --> 52:19.204
And the great man wrote back and said, I miss the boat.

52:22.648 --> 52:23.649
That took some courage.

52:23.869 --> 52:25.190
Oh, it took some courage.

52:25.210 --> 52:28.453
He was a Frenchman too, and they're not very keen at missing boats.

52:29.814 --> 52:41.886
And I met him later, and he put his head down and said,

52:43.013 --> 52:48.558
I should be really not looking at the face.

52:48.578 --> 52:51.020
Could you tell us a little bit about the Aquinas project?

52:52.001 --> 53:03.912
Well, at the moment, you know, I am not that well up in it, because I haven't really got my teeth into it yet.

53:03.932 --> 53:08.256
But they've been going, you see, what, 1881?

53:08.276 --> 53:12.700
So that's a hundred and something years.

53:13.169 --> 53:17.895
And the rationale behind it is, this is something that could take 200 years, isn't it?

53:17.915 --> 53:18.716
Yes, God knows.

53:20.337 --> 53:21.859
I'm not going to hang around that long.

53:22.941 --> 53:28.107
But 1881, we're already 116 years into it.

53:28.187 --> 53:28.948
I know, I know.

53:28.968 --> 53:35.415
And the editor has died in an odorous sanctity.

53:37.157 --> 53:39.480
And some have spent all their lives at it.

53:40.878 --> 53:44.743
There are those, remember it's generally anonymous work.

53:44.803 --> 53:45.924
They work in teams.

53:47.687 --> 53:52.172
And so there isn't even the satisfaction of saying such and such a work of St.

53:52.192 --> 53:56.558
Thomas critically edited by Jack Smith.

53:56.578 --> 54:00.183
It's critically edited by a committee of the Dominicans.

54:02.265 --> 54:09.855
Now and then, in the past 10 or 15 years, they have had more sense

54:10.426 --> 54:18.274
the introduction is written by the chief editor, whose science is written, which is only fair.

54:18.294 --> 54:26.643
But they began off with the Sunnah of St.

54:26.663 --> 54:35.893
Thomas, which they completed in record time, about seven or eight years, by using

54:38.219 --> 54:41.863
a number of manuscripts but nothing compared to what there are.

54:43.445 --> 54:56.419
So they now, unfortunately, this will be up to me, we have a meeting on Wednesday about this, to redo the Summa Sentons.

54:59.142 --> 55:07.872
I want to be, I really want this proved to me that it needs redoing when in fact we have not yet

55:08.223 --> 55:12.789
tackled the ones that haven't been done.

55:12.809 --> 55:21.341
I mean a hundred years and people have been basing themselves on this text which now is defective they say.

55:21.361 --> 55:23.544
So do we have to correct all the theology?

55:24.164 --> 55:28.350
I want this proved to me first that this is essential.

55:29.412 --> 55:34.939
Here I just say look at all the scholarship in the last hundred years based upon this critical edition.

55:35.594 --> 55:39.663
If it ain't critical, who's kidding whom?

55:39.683 --> 55:45.636
Does this suggest that it's possibly wasted scholarship?

55:45.817 --> 55:55.358
I personally think that the changes are so many, I would say this privately,

55:56.114 --> 56:00.580
I don't think it's justified at the moment.

56:00.760 --> 56:02.783
This is one thing I'm asking for.

56:02.823 --> 56:04.865
I want chapter and verse.

56:04.885 --> 56:06.267
Show me where it's wrong.

56:07.409 --> 56:13.056
Show me not just where it's wrong, but where it has misled people.

56:13.476 --> 56:16.861
It is just a question.

56:16.941 --> 56:21.767
The sentence is slightly wrong, but it says they're forgettable.

56:22.321 --> 56:29.170
But there are a number of volumes of works still not critically edited.

56:29.871 --> 56:37.420
I've got two in my room now, which have been a long time in coming, and it's God sent to heaven.

56:39.883 --> 56:47.653
But even these now... I took the notes, yes.

56:56.763 --> 56:59.707
Which piece, I'm sorry, in the New Yorker?

57:00.107 --> 57:04.814
A piece in the New Yorker about, you know, throwing out card indexes.

57:04.834 --> 57:06.796
Oh, yes, that was Nick Baker's piece as well.

57:09.179 --> 57:10.601
He did two pieces in the New Yorker.

57:10.621 --> 57:11.823
That was the first one.

57:17.971 --> 57:22.737
That's a good fact.

57:25.248 --> 57:44.574
Anthony Grafton has a new book coming out from Harvard Press.

57:44.674 --> 57:48.179
It's just being published right now.

57:50.402 --> 57:51.964
Anthony's an extraordinary man.

57:52.197 --> 57:57.665
I'm going to do an interview with him.

57:57.725 --> 58:07.019
He's an extraordinary man.

58:07.580 --> 58:11.325
This is the preface volume, you see?

58:11.345 --> 58:18.576
With all the listing of all the manuscripts and their description,

58:20.868 --> 58:29.738
So you're coming rather new to Aquinas, is what you're saying?

58:30.198 --> 58:37.126
Not to Aquinas, but to the critical edition.

58:37.146 --> 58:40.930
The introduction volume, and then the text.

58:42.992 --> 58:50.200
Now that took years... That's the 25th volume, is that right?

58:50.433 --> 58:54.760
Yes.

58:55.001 --> 58:58.346
So how many do they estimate?

58:59.108 --> 59:03.415
Probably another ten, I would say.

59:03.435 --> 59:04.617
So it's in the home stretch.

59:04.717 --> 59:06.120
Oh, it's in the home stretch.

59:06.200 --> 59:09.225
I mean, I won't finish it off.

59:09.245 --> 59:14.654
Even if I were to live for twenty years, I had no intention of doing it.

59:14.854 --> 59:16.457
Write down this information, please.

59:16.960 --> 59:23.629
But you will find them in most, as they say, in most reputable life.

59:23.649 --> 59:23.809
Indeed.

59:23.829 --> 59:24.690
Well, we're fortunate.

59:24.710 --> 59:26.332
We don't live far from Boston.

59:26.553 --> 59:33.201
I read at the Widener Library of Boston and all of them, so there's no problem finding any of them.

59:33.301 --> 59:34.343
You'll find it at St.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.666
John's Seminary.

59:36.686 --> 59:38.448
That's right.

59:38.468 --> 59:43.495
Where Larry, Larry, Walsh is it?

59:43.515 --> 59:43.795
Walsh.

59:44.382 --> 59:45.383
I think so.

59:45.824 --> 59:52.312
Tomorrow we're going to Monte Cassino, of course.

59:52.332 --> 59:59.821
Is it Don Faustino who's looking after you?

01:00:00.121 --> 01:00:07.550
Lucy Gordon has arranged this and she's taking us down.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:11.875
Of course I wanted to discuss in this book

01:00:12.057 --> 01:00:19.566
One of the reasons for going here is to just discuss for readers how important the rule of Benedict is.

01:00:22.089 --> 01:00:27.736
What would the history of the world, in terms of culture and literature, be without that rule?

01:00:27.997 --> 01:00:31.922
I wonder how often people pause to think about that.

01:00:31.942 --> 01:00:34.885
Is that something that people would?

01:00:35.226 --> 01:00:37.909
Now and then they would.

01:00:37.929 --> 01:00:41.153
There is a volume

01:00:41.521 --> 01:01:04.742
published in England, maybe 1952 or something, with articles precisely on the place of monasticism in passing on culture.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:08.946
Now that's in my view,

01:01:09.196 --> 01:01:09.937
Where is it?

01:01:10.757 --> 01:01:12.759
I can find it.

01:01:12.779 --> 01:01:19.646
There was a popular book written a few years ago, How the Irish Saved Civilization by Tom Cahill.

01:01:20.187 --> 01:01:37.363
Curiously, I laughed when I saw the title, and it reminded me of that, that volume that was about 20 years ago called

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.381
The Irish book.

01:01:40.441 --> 01:01:41.843
Sex.

01:01:41.863 --> 01:01:43.385
I have that book.

01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:47.190
I was a book review editor at the time when I came in for St.

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.952
Patrick's Day.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.594
Do you remember the ones all blank pages?

01:01:50.614 --> 01:01:53.637
All blank pages.

01:01:53.858 --> 01:01:58.503
And I thought that, you know, when I saw this, that somebody's humming us on again, you see?

01:01:58.523 --> 01:02:01.407
Do you remember what the title of it was?

01:02:01.687 --> 01:02:03.950
I remember it was Brace Yourself, Bridget.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.174
Something like that.

01:02:07.494 --> 01:02:09.156
And so...

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:26.367
I happened one day here, having coffee at lunch, and I said, a crazy book came out some time ago.

01:02:26.387 --> 01:02:28.169
I said, no, I haven't.

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:33.675
Well, I lent it to you.

01:02:34.432 --> 01:02:39.970
And it's done with great grace and humor.
