WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:05.676
Okay, this is now on, and I'll put it over here.

00:07.719 --> 00:11.924
If at any time you want me to shut it off, I'll shut it off.

00:13.687 --> 00:15.789
The book is horrendous.

00:17.532 --> 00:25.923
I have to submit a manuscript by March of 91, in the early stages of the research.

00:28.086 --> 00:31.911
And you will not learn how to collect books in here.

00:32.465 --> 00:58.000
Okay, so you don't have to give a locus for the collection, and otherwise you don't have to say it's on such and such a street and such a town.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.902
Okay.

00:59.922 --> 01:03.027
And from that point, Lisa... But it's easy to find out.

01:03.648 --> 01:04.069
Yes.

01:04.129 --> 01:07.874
But I think... I don't know whether... Well, what do you feel?

01:07.894 --> 01:11.460
I don't know.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.224
Let's... There's never been any publicity about us as collectors.

01:14.745 --> 01:19.732
I mean, obviously... Madeline Stern wrote an article on women's collectors.

01:19.752 --> 01:21.895
How many can be read on Stern?

01:21.915 --> 01:22.336
And Western did.

01:22.356 --> 01:23.418
He should.

01:23.498 --> 01:25.000
Too bad Hamill and Barker did it.

01:25.216 --> 01:39.713
But in fact, you should find a copy of an article that Francis Hamill wrote published in the, I think the Transactions of the Bibliographical Society in America called Some Unconventional Women.

01:39.733 --> 01:45.380
It's women, bibliophiles, collectors, printers before 1800s.

01:45.400 --> 01:53.890
And it would also be very interesting to know the real history of women and publishing and printing in American colonial America.

01:54.578 --> 01:57.761
I'm not going to find that in particular.

01:57.781 --> 01:59.443
But he's interested in collecting these.

01:59.463 --> 02:01.365
No, but they're collectors.

02:01.566 --> 02:03.147
Bibliophiles, they're collectors.

02:03.187 --> 02:10.816
But you should have it historically as well, I think, since you are having a, there is a historic aspect of the book.

02:10.836 --> 02:18.544
Well, I think I have to disprove Eugene Field's moronic basis that women don't collect.

02:19.233 --> 02:27.422
And that's very easily... The women will be represented.

02:27.442 --> 02:33.469
No, but it's interesting to see how really important they were to songs.

02:33.489 --> 02:35.131
I think it's a short article.

02:35.151 --> 02:36.553
It would be amusing to you.

02:36.733 --> 02:39.296
And how recent is that article, as you said?

02:39.316 --> 02:41.418
In the last couple of years?

02:41.518 --> 02:43.621
No, it's only 20 years.

02:43.641 --> 02:47.485
I'll be talking about starting last year, in any case.

02:47.802 --> 02:49.184
It's Frances Hamel.

02:49.204 --> 02:50.805
She was a Chicago bookseller.

02:51.046 --> 02:51.827
Great bookseller.

02:51.847 --> 02:53.609
The firm was called Hamel and Barkley.

02:53.649 --> 02:55.150
There were two women.

02:55.170 --> 02:56.251
That's famous, yeah.

02:56.272 --> 03:07.244
And she... Well, I think, let's just start... It is interesting that you are a couple and you collect.

03:08.846 --> 03:11.769
Would you say you collect independently of each other?

03:13.271 --> 03:15.413
You have certainly separately defined collections.

03:16.996 --> 03:30.614
I would say that we collect some books in consort and that we pursue certain books independently.

03:31.735 --> 03:46.615
I think Lisa, far more than I, has built an incredible collection in the history of women, which, you know, it's very hard to evaluate a collection because one doesn't see all the ones that one can compare it to.

03:46.915 --> 03:49.458
But as far as one can gather, it's one of the great collections.

03:50.339 --> 03:53.884
How long have you been collecting, what was it?

03:53.904 --> 03:56.768
Since the late, women's books were collecting.

03:56.788 --> 03:58.009
Let's do both of them.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.631
Women's books since the late 60s.

04:00.212 --> 04:04.217
I've always been a packer.

04:04.257 --> 04:05.339
Are you from Massachusetts?

04:05.359 --> 04:07.962
No, I'm from Brooklyn.

04:09.404 --> 04:10.365
You've been married how long?

04:11.266 --> 04:12.968
We've been together since 1964.

04:12.988 --> 04:15.792
We're about 25 years.

04:16.463 --> 04:21.728
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:22.309 --> 04:25.672
The collection has been, you've been pursuing the collection in earnest.

04:25.873 --> 04:34.141
Well, I didn't begin, the real, the really passionate collecting of women's books began in the late 50s.

04:34.542 --> 04:42.269
Parallel time to the beginning of the revival of the women's books.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.732
Was that the catalyst of the book?

04:45.235 --> 04:49.840
You know, there were many women who were involved in the literature who don't collect books.

04:49.860 --> 04:50.641
But you were a collector.

04:50.661 --> 04:53.244
You said you were involved in a background.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.025
Yeah, I always had books.

04:55.306 --> 05:02.453
But her collecting instincts were sharpened and intensified once our relationship was established.

05:02.473 --> 05:05.577
Being older than Lisa, obviously, I've been doing it far longer.

05:05.637 --> 05:14.446
So there was a collection into which she merged, and then her own instincts for collecting had a way to express themselves.

05:14.466 --> 05:15.107
I would say that.

05:15.256 --> 05:25.786
I don't see the thing as very distinct, except for the women's books.

05:25.846 --> 05:28.969
I think that's a distinctive, fantastic collection of material.

05:29.650 --> 05:41.702
The other collecting, the early illustrated books, which was the original and central part of our collecting, but that also has become

05:42.273 --> 05:49.881
That has slackened off to a degree simply because the material has become so scarce and the prices have become so awesome.

05:50.882 --> 05:55.267
But I started collecting books literally when I was 13 years old.

05:55.287 --> 05:58.551
I went to my first auction when I was about 13.

05:58.871 --> 05:59.912
Did you bid your first book?

05:59.932 --> 06:00.713
I bid a book.

06:00.753 --> 06:02.295
I bought a 75-cent book.

06:02.315 --> 06:02.756
Really?

06:02.776 --> 06:03.636
What was it?

06:03.777 --> 06:06.079
It was one of Kirshenbaum's relatives.

06:07.401 --> 06:11.385
There were two book auctions on Fourth Avenue when I was a child.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.214
One was called the American Book Auction, one was called the City Book Auction.

06:16.555 --> 06:24.004
They were both run by Kirsch and Bounds, a descendant of whom is a very good artist, by the way, Jules Kirsch, by the way, who teaches at Des Moines, Iowa.

06:24.665 --> 06:27.268
Yeah.

06:27.288 --> 06:37.880
And I literally was either 13 and a half or 14, or the 18th century edition of one of Plato's Symposium for 75 centuries.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.663
Did you know then, at age 13, that you were collected?

06:40.947 --> 06:45.531
I had an instinct for collectivize, you know, I was a collector, you know.

06:45.551 --> 06:47.393
But by the time I was 18, I knew it.

06:50.036 --> 06:51.697
I was about 15 years.

06:51.718 --> 06:57.303
I bought, instead of my plane, it was my first time.

06:57.423 --> 07:01.287
And I was following those very best when I was supposed to be.

07:01.307 --> 07:09.655
As a teenager, and a tremendous trouble with my parents, who, even though they could well afford it,

07:11.390 --> 07:18.196
What was the focus of your collection in the early years?

07:18.316 --> 07:19.577
Art books, I suppose.

07:19.597 --> 07:20.658
So was mine.

07:21.058 --> 07:23.220
Art books for the most books.

07:23.240 --> 07:29.665
And at that time, it's interesting looking for women artists.

07:29.685 --> 07:32.908
Somebody asked me last night about Colbert.

07:33.769 --> 07:40.975
And when I began collecting and becoming interested in her, she was one of the few role models, one

07:41.461 --> 07:46.687
I have one woman artist in the United States.

07:46.928 --> 07:49.671
I don't have a woman artist in the United States.

07:50.672 --> 07:51.433
I studied arts.

07:51.453 --> 07:52.815
I studied arts in the United States.

07:52.835 --> 07:54.056
And there was a public school in the United States.

07:54.076 --> 07:58.241
And she was one of the few women artists that I discovered.

07:58.261 --> 08:02.947
I certainly didn't discover her at school because nobody had COVID for that.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.489
I think your mother had COVID.

08:04.509 --> 08:08.934
My mother didn't have COVID since her after, I think, after I left the house.

08:09.095 --> 08:09.495
Really?

08:09.515 --> 08:11.097
It was Princeton in the United States.

08:11.465 --> 08:15.891
How do you enjoy a collection like this?

08:15.911 --> 08:16.872
How?

08:16.892 --> 08:17.573
We play.

08:18.574 --> 08:19.315
It's just endless.

08:19.335 --> 08:19.736
We play.

08:19.836 --> 08:20.617
Why does one collect?

08:20.697 --> 08:24.562
I mean, that is a very complex and difficult question.

08:24.602 --> 08:26.665
But that was, this is what you'll have to come up with.

08:26.685 --> 08:35.937
We also collect, I mean, the early illustrated books, Lenny was interrupted and collected early illustrated books in specific areas, we've had to sell different

08:36.271 --> 08:37.072
Parts of our collection.

08:37.092 --> 08:41.419
Parts of our collection over the years because we haven't had the money to just keep buying.

08:41.439 --> 08:42.320
Just keep buying.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.964
And we don't only collect books.

08:45.084 --> 08:47.287
It's only a small part of our collection.

08:47.307 --> 08:48.669
Not a small, but one part.

08:48.689 --> 08:49.350
It's a part of it.

08:49.370 --> 08:51.914
We used to collect old master prints.

08:51.934 --> 08:53.396
We still collect old master prints.

08:53.416 --> 08:58.103
We sold many of them and now have begun recently again to buy old master prints.

08:58.143 --> 08:59.886
We collect the Renaissance medals.

09:00.286 --> 09:00.707
Bronzes.

09:00.727 --> 09:01.268
Bronzes.

09:01.328 --> 09:01.829
Blackheads.

09:03.111 --> 09:06.075
And I collect something called Memorial Brewery, which, again,

09:06.427 --> 09:10.651
Nobody was interested in when I was buying it in the early 50s.

09:10.671 --> 09:11.732
Let's go back a little bit.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.873
You said you had to sell things?

09:13.153 --> 09:13.394
Yeah.

09:13.434 --> 09:14.835
Yeah, we had many collections.

09:14.935 --> 09:18.659
You had to sell them, but you sold them because... We had to sell them.

09:18.679 --> 09:18.939
Yes, we did.

09:18.959 --> 09:23.443
We are what the French call an amateur marchand, collector-dealer.

09:24.504 --> 09:24.605
Okay.

09:24.625 --> 09:33.413
In other words, we're not dealers in any real sense, but the phrase is cogent, I think, because not being as rich as Paul Mellon, we can't only buy it.

09:33.764 --> 09:38.991
From time to time, we get in trouble either with the government or with just great indebtedness.

09:39.132 --> 09:41.014
Instead of paying taxes, we bought books.

09:41.034 --> 09:44.499
And so in order to pay out the taxes, you have to sell books.

09:44.519 --> 09:51.048
We, for example, had a great collection of early colored engraved books.

09:51.068 --> 09:51.789
Can you give me a few examples?

09:51.809 --> 09:55.154
Yeah, we had all of the great Gauthier's Daggerty books.

09:55.174 --> 09:56.616
All of them.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.649
We had all of them.

09:58.669 --> 09:58.950
All of them.

09:58.970 --> 10:00.011
So the collection was complete.

10:00.031 --> 10:00.332
Yes.

10:00.352 --> 10:01.013
Virtually.

10:01.193 --> 10:02.054
Well, everything that was complete.

10:02.074 --> 10:03.556
Well, everything that you could possibly get.

10:03.576 --> 10:06.700
And we had duplicates of certain things, like the little truffle book.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.723
That's right.

10:08.743 --> 10:09.684
How did you steal them?

10:09.765 --> 10:10.105
What?

10:10.365 --> 10:11.587
How did you steal them?

10:11.607 --> 10:12.248
How did you steal them?

10:12.328 --> 10:13.069
Terrible.

10:14.852 --> 10:15.532
Terrible.

10:15.873 --> 10:18.136
Oh, my God.

10:18.156 --> 10:20.199
How did you come to this decision?

10:20.219 --> 10:22.101
We had a great collection of prospective books.

10:22.342 --> 10:24.825
We had a great collection of emblem books.

10:24.845 --> 10:26.147
There are lots of areas that

10:26.583 --> 10:27.364
Finish off.

10:28.005 --> 10:28.186
Finish.

10:28.206 --> 10:30.069
We couldn't acquire any more.

10:30.089 --> 10:35.378
We had tried, one of our goals was to get every 16th century emblem looked.

10:35.398 --> 10:36.160
That's a hard thing.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.544
Today you can't get even the 17th century ones.

10:38.845 --> 10:40.407
Well, we just sold a great book.

10:40.868 --> 10:44.254
For the past week, we have two kids in school with tuition costs.

10:44.707 --> 10:46.529
We sold a great book last week.

10:46.949 --> 10:48.070
During the fair, actually.

10:48.710 --> 10:49.291
Before the book.

10:49.311 --> 10:50.072
Before the book.

10:50.092 --> 10:50.472
Before the book.

10:50.492 --> 10:50.892
Before the book.

10:50.912 --> 10:53.875
Well, I wanted to talk about that because it's not fair to the dealer.

10:53.895 --> 10:54.055
No.

10:54.195 --> 10:54.876
No, it's not.

10:55.276 --> 10:56.077
It's still not.

10:56.637 --> 11:03.964
It's just a book, an 18th century book, an early natural history book in color, a fantastic book.

11:03.984 --> 11:05.245
But we needed money.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.026
We had two tools, you know.

11:06.046 --> 11:08.087
Oh, you sold it to a dealer?

11:08.107 --> 11:08.207
Yeah.

11:08.227 --> 11:11.130
Is that generally how you send a book to dealers?

11:11.150 --> 11:13.532
Well, the Goji Daggett's went through Sotheby's.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.894
I've never sold a book.

11:16.914 --> 11:18.655
I don't know what that would feel like.

11:18.675 --> 11:19.396
It's all a book.

11:19.436 --> 11:20.797
We sold, we sold.

11:21.117 --> 11:36.070
The first sales we had to achieve many years ago in the late 60s, somebody who was involved in publishing Lenny's prints and dealing with his work went into bankruptcy and our income stuff.

11:36.090 --> 11:39.433
And Lenny's... We had a correction of the works of Thomas Aikens.

11:39.954 --> 11:42.035
And Lenny's tax, he taxed his paintings.

11:42.316 --> 11:43.737
Five sculptures and four paintings.

11:44.257 --> 11:45.038
And we sold him.

11:46.503 --> 11:52.990
Today it would be worth the incalculable fortune, but we got a lot of money to have it, but nothing what it would be today.

11:53.230 --> 11:56.914
Once you sold that... That was like the opening of the time.

11:57.474 --> 12:00.257
That was probably the toughest thing I had to sell.

12:00.277 --> 12:00.778
That's right.

12:00.818 --> 12:12.530
Then the emblem books went, then the colorful goje dagaties went, then the perspective... We had a great collection of a kind of pottery called mocha, which is now between Palaka prices.

12:12.550 --> 12:15.413
We had over three and a few pieces of it.

12:16.051 --> 12:17.653
in the early 70s.

12:17.673 --> 12:18.954
Were there any days in school?

12:18.974 --> 12:20.375
One's at Chuck, one's at Yale.

12:22.397 --> 12:24.039
I've got two girls coming along.

12:24.059 --> 12:24.800
You just wait.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.022
And then eight and seven tonight.

12:30.205 --> 12:35.931
Yeah, our problem is never, all these people complain about finding stuff.

12:35.951 --> 12:37.012
There's endless stuff to buy.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.194
There's so much stuff, there's just not enough money.

12:39.214 --> 12:41.577
Let me just throw you something out.

12:41.597 --> 12:43.999
I'm talking to David Briggs, who's great.

12:44.553 --> 12:57.110
He said, if you have $100 million to spend, and he said, don't laugh, because from where I'm sitting, I see Van Gogh's name is $53 million.

12:57.130 --> 12:58.612
$100 million ain't so much money.

12:58.632 --> 13:01.175
And he said, you know, for the price of two or three paintings.

13:01.195 --> 13:02.277
That's right.

13:02.577 --> 13:06.062
You could build one of the finest libraries in the world.

13:06.542 --> 13:06.863
True.

13:07.263 --> 13:13.952
And he said, because all of a sudden, the institutional money is no longer available, so that the private collectors who are buying

13:14.827 --> 13:20.313
And also the people who have everything to sell are putting them up because they see the prices.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.038
I think there's an extraordinary level of quality.

13:24.058 --> 13:25.820
The prices are still awesome.

13:25.940 --> 13:27.522
But you said, how did you get it all?

13:27.542 --> 13:28.283
Yeah, how did you get it all?

13:28.303 --> 13:30.385
Because you could grow one of the world's finest collections.

13:30.405 --> 13:32.408
Yes, that's absolutely true.

13:33.048 --> 13:36.953
When I began buying, no one was interested.

13:38.519 --> 13:44.409
I mean, I have great delight in looking, there are certain books I leave the prices in, most of the books I have.

13:44.429 --> 13:45.791
Can you give me a couple of examples?

13:45.811 --> 13:51.541
Yeah, I have a wonderful, I have a Catherine, some, I don't use the word seminal, you say generative.

13:51.621 --> 13:53.825
I think that's a good one.

13:53.965 --> 13:57.311
In this context, it's a very kind.

13:57.331 --> 13:58.032
Generative.

13:58.132 --> 13:59.114
Generative.

13:59.134 --> 13:59.695
Generative.

14:00.136 --> 14:02.079
I do it as soon as it's left my book.

14:02.099 --> 14:04.543
Okay, writer should be aware of it.

14:04.726 --> 14:06.788
Well, give them some examples.

14:07.229 --> 14:20.082
I'm interested not just in the ... One of the big distinctions between the women's books and the rest of the books we collect is the women's books are collected solely for content.

14:20.102 --> 14:20.442
Right?

14:21.003 --> 14:24.026
As opposed to the fabric of the book, the physical fabric of the book.

14:24.046 --> 14:25.448
Which is why the other books are collected.

14:25.468 --> 14:26.449
Which is why the other books are collected.

14:26.469 --> 14:28.431
None of those books are ever read, aren't they?

14:28.451 --> 14:31.594
However, within the collection of women's books,

14:32.384 --> 14:35.669
There are books that have been produced by women.

14:35.729 --> 14:38.593
That are fans of them.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.938
Women printers, illustrators, women binders, etc.

14:41.958 --> 14:45.122
Lisa collects everything.

14:45.142 --> 14:45.763
No, I don't.

14:45.783 --> 14:46.584
Yes, you do.

14:46.684 --> 14:47.125
No, I don't.

14:47.145 --> 14:48.807
They don't collect travel books.

14:48.827 --> 14:50.169
There is a bibliophile.

14:50.189 --> 14:56.819
A woman who does collect women travelers, who I believe is a member of the brilliant books.

14:56.839 --> 14:58.481
Mr. Newtruck, is he still a librarian?

14:58.842 --> 15:00.484
He could probably fix you up.

15:01.055 --> 15:07.463
I bought a little binding by Catherine Adams, a darling little book.

15:07.943 --> 15:09.605
She was, do you know the name?

15:10.106 --> 15:11.547
Gilderville and the book behind her.

15:11.567 --> 15:12.869
No, she was a common standard.

15:13.049 --> 15:18.515
Sarah Friedo and Catherine Adams were the two great turn of the century.

15:18.536 --> 15:21.239
The name I get, by the way, I check out.

15:21.619 --> 15:22.700
Pardon me, we're just checking.

15:23.061 --> 15:24.042
Yeah, we're doing fine.

15:24.222 --> 15:25.183
I bought a Catherine Adams.

15:25.283 --> 15:28.247
Ruth Mortimer, in fact, was here visiting last winter.

15:28.267 --> 15:30.910
And I showed her my little Catherine Adams binding.

15:31.497 --> 15:35.843
which still had the original price, I think, of five or ten pounds written inside.

15:36.023 --> 15:42.752
Smith had just acquired theirs, I believe, for $5,000, so I was quite excited.

15:42.773 --> 15:43.353
That's an example.

15:43.373 --> 15:43.954
Another example.

15:43.974 --> 15:44.875
How many volumes did you say you had?

15:44.895 --> 15:45.877
Those were all women.

15:45.897 --> 15:48.460
That whole wall behind you is all women.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.947
The room inside is women's bibliographies.

15:54.288 --> 16:01.318
My study is full of black women's history and 19th century American women's history.

16:01.872 --> 16:03.474
You have no idea.

16:03.494 --> 16:04.495
I have no idea.

16:04.595 --> 16:07.199
Have you cataloged it?

16:07.219 --> 16:07.439
Sure.

16:07.459 --> 16:11.223
When we lived in England, I had a secretary who was working.

16:11.864 --> 16:13.626
It's a good deal that is cataloged.

16:13.646 --> 16:15.308
No, no, not any longer than that.

16:15.328 --> 16:16.690
I said, but a lot of it has been cataloged.

16:16.790 --> 16:22.557
And we had a rudimentary catalog, probably about, I would say, 20% of the books are on card.

16:22.577 --> 16:26.903
And we have a computer, and neither of us are interested in computers, operating computers, etc.

16:26.923 --> 16:31.288
And I'd really have to go about buying a hardware drive for the computer,

16:31.707 --> 16:36.073
But the interesting thing is that the greatness of Lisa's collection is not printed books.

16:36.093 --> 16:36.534
I don't know.

16:36.554 --> 16:37.055
Well, it's not true.

16:37.275 --> 16:37.836
It's the family.

16:38.657 --> 16:39.638
It's pamphlets.

16:39.658 --> 16:43.184
It's all the throwaways, all the things that... And manuscripts.

16:43.684 --> 16:44.806
And manuscripts.

16:44.826 --> 16:45.247
And journals.

16:45.267 --> 16:47.289
That's what Francis Parkman did right after the Civil War.

16:47.310 --> 16:52.637
And he went down south and did all these pictures of the family and almanacs.

16:52.797 --> 17:00.128
Well, tell him about your... About the Clarence collection.

17:00.513 --> 17:07.724
At least that bought a collection of 600 papers, for instance.

17:09.127 --> 17:09.507
Really?

17:13.173 --> 17:17.440
I don't know.

17:18.061 --> 17:20.705
Oh, yeah.

17:20.985 --> 17:24.010
Oh, yeah, these are all books.

17:24.170 --> 17:28.377
I mean, when you're going to have a great number of

17:28.913 --> 17:41.406
You know, the 19th, 16th century book, this is a hope you were mentioning.

17:41.426 --> 17:42.927
Oh, that's, it's not holy.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.113
You do have a hope, but not that one.

17:48.313 --> 17:48.653
That's true.

17:48.673 --> 17:54.579
Isn't that easy?

17:55.881 --> 17:56.201
No, no, no.

17:56.221 --> 17:56.321
Yeah.

17:56.341 --> 17:57.182
That's true.

17:59.592 --> 18:07.543
Oh, this is really wonderful.

18:07.563 --> 18:10.407
Oh, that's a very great thing.

18:10.427 --> 18:10.967
Oh, is it?

18:10.987 --> 18:13.010
A tooth.

18:13.270 --> 18:14.072
A tooth.

18:15.113 --> 18:15.373
A tooth.

18:16.034 --> 18:16.194
A tooth.

18:16.214 --> 18:20.961
It says, oh, that's a tooth.

18:20.981 --> 18:21.161
Yes, sir.

18:21.181 --> 18:22.162
Look at this copy.

18:22.182 --> 18:24.626
You'll never see this book like that.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.088
It's not talking.

18:26.108 --> 18:27.169
It gets ragged.

18:27.189 --> 18:27.810
It's used so much.

18:31.908 --> 18:35.171
This is wonderful.

18:35.191 --> 18:43.298
And it's a response to not to identify women.

18:43.318 --> 18:44.039
That's the title?

18:44.219 --> 18:46.921
Yeah, it was a harangue.

18:46.941 --> 18:51.886
And it is... Just read this title, just so I can pick it up a little bit.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.307
It's John Elmer's response.

18:54.548 --> 19:01.054
It's a... A problem with a clancy subject against the late-blown blank concerning the government of women.

19:01.540 --> 19:17.214
Wherein he considered all such reasons as a stranger's ways made, and as he has with his brief extortation to do it.

19:17.234 --> 19:23.359
It's, um, it's, uh, Strock for, uh, Strock for, uh, 1659.

19:23.539 --> 19:23.740
Good.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.320
A lot of wonderful books.

19:24.821 --> 19:30.125
And you've got a sentence here by Charlotte Blanquist, and what is... Well, he says a letter of Charlotte Blanquist, or a letter?

19:30.145 --> 19:30.906
A wonderful letter.

19:31.375 --> 19:36.381
And a Mrs. Gaskell letter?

19:40.106 --> 19:43.510
In it, she announces her intention.

19:45.072 --> 19:46.234
Well, she's written the letter.

19:46.254 --> 19:52.401
I have to look him up.

19:52.421 --> 19:54.204
What does it?

19:54.684 --> 19:55.665
I'll be right back.

19:55.685 --> 19:56.366
What kinds are you?

19:56.527 --> 19:56.927
Come on, John.

19:57.565 --> 19:58.707
What kind of study?

19:58.727 --> 19:59.368
Chuck Russell.

19:59.928 --> 20:00.509
The breed.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.332
The breed, yeah.

20:03.574 --> 20:06.558
They're ratters bred for stability.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.442
How many volumes did you see?

20:09.462 --> 20:09.723
I don't know.

20:09.743 --> 20:10.804
We've never counted them.

20:10.824 --> 20:12.887
We must have 30,000 books in that.

20:13.608 --> 20:13.909
Wow.

20:13.929 --> 20:14.410
Do you think?

20:14.950 --> 20:16.373
It must be something like that.

20:17.114 --> 20:18.095
But that's irrelevant.

20:18.916 --> 20:21.520
Well, I don't think it's irrelevant.

20:21.540 --> 20:26.307
One book can be so fantastic as to

20:27.535 --> 20:32.001
collect a number of games, just not believe in this, you know.

20:32.021 --> 20:38.431
For example, if I climb up and climb, just be careful, that's all.

20:38.451 --> 20:39.853
Take, for example, this book.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.137
It's the book I mean.

20:43.237 --> 20:44.499
You know where they all are, too.

20:44.519 --> 20:46.602
I know most of them.

20:46.622 --> 20:53.492
This is one of the rarest books by a great...

20:55.177 --> 20:58.200
16th century engraver, Crispin van der Post.

20:59.120 --> 20:59.821
Do you know that name?

20:59.881 --> 21:02.984
He's one of the Flemish greatest engravers of the 16th century.

21:03.524 --> 21:06.046
And it's a book of the nymphs of the Amstel.

21:06.847 --> 21:08.809
Amstel is the great river in Amstel, right?

21:09.269 --> 21:16.115
These are Flemish and Dutch ladies of aristocratic and upper middle class quality dressed as shepherds.

21:16.395 --> 21:19.158
Dressed in the costumes of shepherdess that week.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.660
This is an incredibly scarce book.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.821
What has numbers got them to?

21:22.901 --> 21:25.183
I could buy a thousand books for what this book is worth.

21:26.615 --> 21:27.756
How long have you had that book?

21:29.459 --> 21:32.542
I didn't recommend it.

21:32.783 --> 21:33.263
I know.

21:33.424 --> 21:34.625
It must be back.

21:35.226 --> 21:36.307
It's before we moved to England.

21:37.969 --> 21:39.331
Where is it, just so I can write that down?

21:40.593 --> 21:42.034
What is the name of the book?

21:42.054 --> 21:42.135
Yes.

21:42.155 --> 21:47.561
It's called The Bouquet de Belche.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.445
The Bouquet of Shepherdesses.

21:55.758 --> 22:04.150
We argue about shelving.

22:07.215 --> 22:14.446
Well, so to talk about numbers of books becomes irrelevant.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.669
So you have favorites, then, clearly.

22:16.889 --> 22:22.257
I'll tell you one of my greatest musicals.

22:22.277 --> 22:25.562
Sort of a book I thought we would never own.

22:26.842 --> 22:29.846
Oh my God, look at that.

22:30.026 --> 22:44.987
This is a book that belonged to a cardinal, and part of the original binding is preserved, and rather nicely preserved in a 19th century binding, which has surrounded the original central portion of it.

22:45.828 --> 22:53.659
It's a book, a rather common book, of the life of Thomas Aquinas in 30 engravings,

22:54.145 --> 23:00.752
executed after drawings by Otto Vanius, who was the teacher of Peter Paul Rubens, published in 1610.

23:01.953 --> 23:08.339
This is the most beautiful posse, colored in a way that is breathtaking, gilded and painted.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.162
It just takes my breath away.

23:12.744 --> 23:16.428
It's the kind of book we really never aspire to.

23:17.489 --> 23:18.049
That's right.

23:18.169 --> 23:19.731
It's breathtaking, isn't it?

23:20.521 --> 23:22.623
It's the sort of book you see as a pure Morgan art.

23:22.643 --> 23:24.885
Without being specific, where do you find something like this?

23:24.945 --> 23:25.365
We're lucky.

23:25.645 --> 23:27.907
We found out a bookseller who didn't understand.

23:27.947 --> 23:32.151
He thought the book was, what, three times its uncolored value.

23:34.493 --> 23:36.955
It was colored by a very fine artist.

23:36.975 --> 23:39.617
But you knew that on part of instinct.

23:39.637 --> 23:42.259
I knew, excuse me, I knew who Aquavanius was.

23:44.641 --> 23:47.023
I knew he was Ruben's teacher.

23:47.544 --> 23:50.106
He was a theoretician and artist in his own right.

23:50.643 --> 23:52.786
That's the quality of the painting.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.848
Well, you didn't know the book before you saw it.

23:54.868 --> 23:55.970
I've never seen it, no.

23:56.250 --> 24:04.100
But I've been looking at books now since I was 13 years old, and I'm 67.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.342
It's a long time.

24:06.463 --> 24:07.924
I'm interested as well.

24:08.765 --> 24:11.108
But I was interrupting Lisa.

24:11.128 --> 24:17.376
Yeah, this is an interesting angle that I want to pursue.

24:18.335 --> 24:29.148
You are doubly interesting to me, not only for your extraordinary collection, but for the fact that you are a noted creative artist.

24:29.168 --> 24:29.589
Indeed.

24:30.590 --> 24:34.835
And there aren't that many that I know of.

24:35.736 --> 24:37.458
Artists, serious collectors.

24:37.478 --> 24:44.787
And I wonder if you could maybe talk about the truth.

24:44.807 --> 24:45.869
Rembrandt?

24:45.929 --> 24:46.429
Rembrandt.

24:46.449 --> 24:47.110
Rembrandt.

24:47.309 --> 24:49.752
Yeah, I didn't know that, sir.

24:49.772 --> 24:50.372
Oh, sure.

24:50.412 --> 24:51.233
You didn't know that?

24:51.393 --> 24:53.636
No, no worries.

24:53.656 --> 25:00.143
In fact, the control of his business and money was taken out of his hands by his wife and so on.

25:00.163 --> 25:01.424
And the creditors.

25:02.846 --> 25:03.787
He was profligate.

25:04.828 --> 25:07.651
He collected everything.

25:07.671 --> 25:09.814
He was collecting over what?

25:10.054 --> 25:10.394
Everything.

25:10.735 --> 25:11.055
Everything.

25:11.997 --> 25:13.098
A higher level.

25:15.461 --> 25:26.876
He collected paintings, he collected prints, he collected armor, he collected bronzes, he collected drawings, he collected anything that was beautiful.

25:26.936 --> 25:29.479
Richard Torment to artist art.

25:29.519 --> 25:30.800
Because there was an auction.

25:31.061 --> 25:32.683
And a catalog of this.

25:32.743 --> 25:34.685
A bundle of drawings.

25:34.725 --> 25:35.907
A bundle of prints.

25:35.927 --> 25:38.851
So they would really like to know exactly what it was.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.873
They know a good deal of what he had.

25:41.579 --> 25:44.442
He had renaissance men all the time.

25:44.462 --> 26:02.719
Well, let's talk, when you look at that gorgeous book, I don't expect you to explain the springs of your creativity, but I wonder if there's any kind of... What the connection is?

26:02.739 --> 26:06.803
Yeah, do you get any energy from your... I would think so.

26:07.564 --> 26:10.827
It would be very hard to find any direct relationship

26:11.465 --> 26:14.509
But there can be no question that there is a relationship.

26:16.091 --> 26:20.516
Particularly, just recently, we've been making a collection of portrait books.

26:20.536 --> 26:24.541
It's an area that no one is interested in.

26:24.561 --> 26:27.204
I mean, there are a half a dozen... That's a good opportunity for the collectors.

26:27.364 --> 26:28.105
Indeed, there is.

26:28.185 --> 26:32.831
There's a half a dozen great portrait books that everybody knows and all the great libraries have.

26:33.352 --> 26:36.816
But beyond that, there are hundreds and hundreds that nobody knows about.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.518
Name one or two.

26:38.903 --> 26:39.944
What are the famous ones?

26:40.085 --> 26:44.531
Well, I could show them to you.

26:45.793 --> 26:51.180
They're totally unknown, because collections of portraits tend to be boring for the most part.

26:51.201 --> 26:53.083
They aren't always, but they tend to be.

26:53.864 --> 26:57.069
And they tend to be, as a result, a drug on the market.

26:57.089 --> 26:59.252
The booksellers don't like them.

26:59.272 --> 27:05.321
However, since I started this collection, that market is slowly running.

27:05.421 --> 27:07.003
I've had a direct effect

27:07.220 --> 27:12.128
And every portrait book that comes along is offered to me.

27:12.268 --> 27:24.247
That's something that we can see, and it's happened historically about in many areas.

27:24.267 --> 27:28.373
I mean, creating interest, educating people, people seeing the things.

27:28.393 --> 27:29.535
That's right.

27:29.555 --> 27:32.059
For example, do you know what watch papers are?

27:32.099 --> 27:32.620
No.

27:34.608 --> 27:53.959
Well, when people had those very big watches, and when they brought them to the watchmaker for reparation, the watchmaker would often make a note of what he did on a piece of paper, which was engraved with his name and locus, usually.

27:53.979 --> 27:59.788
And from that commercial interest, which started in the 18th century, a device

28:00.038 --> 28:13.033
grew where lovers would give sailors or someone going off on a long trip, or just generally, a token of affection to keep in their watch.

28:13.053 --> 28:13.834
A little watercolor watch.

28:13.854 --> 28:14.755
A little watercolor.

28:14.775 --> 28:17.598
Well, we have the largest collection in the world of those.

28:18.379 --> 28:18.719
Really?

28:19.000 --> 28:19.520
Naturally.

28:19.540 --> 28:22.844
But if anyone comes on the market, it comes to the market.

28:22.864 --> 28:25.307
The American Access Clarence Society has a collection.

28:25.327 --> 28:26.708
I will show you some if you like.

28:28.130 --> 28:30.012
The AES is wonderful.

28:30.447 --> 28:57.501
precisely that kind of thing i mean they have all the ferry tickets oh sure that's very crucial no i mean it i mean that's how history takes on a graphic side a reality if you well just that if you have a if you have an 1812 ferry ticket that ferry becomes a palpable

28:58.207 --> 29:03.314
in one's imagination instead of just being a figment of one's imagination.

29:03.575 --> 29:08.442
The presence of the ticket lends reality to the idea.

29:09.664 --> 29:10.865
Isn't that true?

29:11.186 --> 29:16.894
Well, it's generally true.

29:16.914 --> 29:17.795
It's wonderfully and very eloquently stated.

29:17.815 --> 29:19.017
You think you must

29:19.402 --> 29:23.187
I would bet that you are of a spirit of Sir Thomas Phillips who collected it.

29:23.207 --> 29:24.849
No, we can't compare it.

29:24.909 --> 29:25.891
Nobody can compare it.

29:25.991 --> 29:29.956
No, certainly not in volume, but in... And he was rich.

29:30.957 --> 29:33.360
He never had to start it.

29:33.761 --> 29:37.145
He had three enormous houses and reduced his family to, no, three.

29:37.246 --> 29:38.627
Three and five rooms.

29:38.647 --> 29:39.889
He had three rooms.

29:41.011 --> 29:42.452
He filled up seven?

29:43.414 --> 29:45.156
But he probably looked and knew his books.

29:45.625 --> 29:48.929
Most of the cases were unopened.

29:48.949 --> 29:57.580
Well, the great story is that in the 60s, they found the only known copy of the first volume of Caxton's The Metamorphosis.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.481
The only known copy.

29:58.762 --> 30:01.465
And it was buried in a pile of junk.

30:01.485 --> 30:05.030
And they say, you know, this alone justifies everything that St.

30:05.070 --> 30:05.791
Thomas fell.

30:05.931 --> 30:08.314
It's a pity it all didn't order the British Library.

30:08.454 --> 30:09.135
They had chance.

30:09.487 --> 30:11.929
He was a violent anti-catholic, Phyllis.

30:11.949 --> 30:12.630
They had a chance.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.392
And that guy, Popsini.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.894
No, that has nothing to do with it.

30:16.914 --> 30:21.559
Let me say that they had a shot and they could have paid, but who knows?

30:21.579 --> 30:24.622
But it is shameful that they don't.

30:24.642 --> 30:27.445
Let me ask... What was that, Librarian Popsini, was it?

30:27.465 --> 30:27.545
Yes.

30:28.145 --> 30:32.149
And Phyllis hated him.

30:32.169 --> 30:32.510
That's correct.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.010
That's right.

30:33.030 --> 30:37.114
As well, he said that his son-in-law and his daughter

30:37.685 --> 30:40.908
were never to be allowed in the house.

30:40.929 --> 30:46.074
And no Catholic, Catholics, without exception, were not to be allowed in the house.

30:46.214 --> 30:46.975
He hated it.

30:46.995 --> 30:49.438
He really hated it.

30:49.458 --> 30:50.259
It was crazy.

30:50.279 --> 30:53.222
Nicholas Parker was in Worcester a couple of weeks ago.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.103
He seized the moment.

30:55.084 --> 30:59.088
And I foolishly said, you know, Phillips was crazy.

30:59.108 --> 31:00.490
And of course, he finished the Monday.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.011
He did the Monday by the hungry.

31:02.031 --> 31:04.614
And he looked at me like, I wouldn't say he was crazy.

31:04.694 --> 31:07.337
I mean, we need to draw that conclusion.

31:08.110 --> 31:11.114
Nicholas Barker is crazy, not Phillips.

31:11.134 --> 31:12.635
Nicholas Barker is an interesting guy.

31:12.716 --> 31:14.197
Nicholas Barker is incredible.

31:15.639 --> 31:16.881
He's unique.

31:16.901 --> 31:17.181
He really is.

31:17.421 --> 31:18.663
He can talk about anything.

31:18.683 --> 31:21.486
On anything and write books on anything as fast as you can say it.

31:21.506 --> 31:24.109
Well, he did the foreword to that garden sale.

31:24.129 --> 31:24.870
Yeah.

31:24.890 --> 31:28.074
This is going to be one of my big stories, by the way, this garden sale.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.176
Is that Have No More?

31:29.216 --> 31:30.777
Haven No More.

31:30.797 --> 31:31.518
Have No More.

31:31.538 --> 31:32.560
Do you know him, by the way?

31:32.700 --> 31:33.421
Have No More.

31:33.681 --> 31:34.542
Is it Haven or Haven?

31:34.662 --> 31:35.383
It's Have No More.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.546
If you work it out, it's Haven O. Moore.

31:40.408 --> 31:40.608
Have.

31:41.710 --> 31:41.910
Have.

31:42.331 --> 31:42.672
No.

31:43.233 --> 31:43.573
Moore.

31:43.954 --> 31:45.376
Do you think that's a Susan?

31:45.476 --> 31:46.639
No, no, no.

31:46.659 --> 31:47.761
It's been speculated.

31:48.201 --> 31:51.387
I'll shut up the tape recorder and tell you an interesting story.

31:51.447 --> 31:52.649
Let's tell you an interesting story.

31:53.350 --> 31:56.616
When you run out of money, what happens?

31:57.017 --> 31:58.359
You have to still buy books.

31:59.481 --> 32:01.084
So I got interested in the book.

32:01.857 --> 32:07.063
from about 1895 to the First World War as a physical object, right?

32:08.184 --> 32:10.267
So content is really not relevant here?

32:10.287 --> 32:12.129
No interest in content whatsoever.

32:12.149 --> 32:17.275
These are books in marvelous condition, bought entirely for their binding.

32:17.555 --> 32:18.176
Like these.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.959
That's a great, great.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.442
And that's an island garden in leather.

32:23.883 --> 32:27.467
That's why it's here.

32:28.348 --> 32:29.749
But that's fabulous.

32:29.770 --> 32:31.071
That's a masterpiece.

32:31.625 --> 32:32.626
A real masterpiece.

32:32.646 --> 32:33.327
Do you know the artist?

32:33.888 --> 32:37.271
I never knew her in any other context.

32:37.451 --> 32:38.693
What, that's a lady named Greenwood?

32:38.713 --> 32:41.996
Yeah, a lady named Greenwood or something.

32:42.017 --> 32:42.217
Greenwood?

32:42.317 --> 32:44.219
Amelia Watts.

32:44.239 --> 32:45.981
She lives in Florida or something like that.

32:46.201 --> 32:46.702
She's alive?

32:47.062 --> 32:48.884
No, she did live in Florida.

32:50.166 --> 32:52.108
They really pulled the place right.

32:52.168 --> 32:56.012
Now, do you think they did the type after they did the place or before?

32:56.971 --> 32:58.313
I think it was done together.

32:58.693 --> 32:59.274
I think so.

32:59.294 --> 33:02.397
I mean, someone did.

33:02.418 --> 33:04.280
They were done separately, printed separately.

33:04.300 --> 33:10.988
They'd done the type, then they were printed, you know, and then trimmed.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.210
So this is what you see.

33:14.152 --> 33:17.455
And I love the books found in paper, yellowbacks.

33:17.536 --> 33:19.158
Try to find them.

33:19.178 --> 33:22.842
Michael Sablier had quite a collection of yellowbacks.

33:22.862 --> 33:23.022
Oh, yes.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.545
And he was involved in these research.

33:25.565 --> 33:26.286
And he doesn't have a chance.

33:26.806 --> 33:28.969
Okay, I'll get that in.

33:28.989 --> 33:29.510
Is that good?

33:29.530 --> 33:32.294
No, I bought all of these books for a dollar, two dollars, three dollars.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.258
Now you can't buy them anymore.

33:35.318 --> 33:41.747
And you know what else?

33:41.767 --> 33:44.270
Yeah, not the last, uh, POS.

33:50.699 --> 33:51.020
Really?

33:51.300 --> 33:56.087
Oh, um, yeah, there was, well, there was a piece on Jenkins in, uh,

33:56.928 --> 33:57.729
And the New Yorker.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.412
Is that the piece?

33:59.552 --> 34:00.634
No, this is in the TLS.

34:00.654 --> 34:00.994
Really?

34:01.855 --> 34:02.797
Do you know Eric Cohen?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.180
The name's familiar.

34:05.421 --> 34:10.328
He writes a column in the TLS called Remainders.

34:10.348 --> 34:10.448
Yeah.

34:10.468 --> 34:12.191
Eric Cohen, huh?

34:12.211 --> 34:14.234
He writes a column called Remainders.

34:16.818 --> 34:19.763
Well, did you read the New Yorker piece on Jenkins?

34:20.464 --> 34:21.645
No.

34:21.906 --> 34:24.690
Well, he just leaves it.

34:25.109 --> 34:54.188
that the police think when you said that this is very good it's walnut raisin

34:54.978 --> 35:06.514
I was mentioning that I have a copy of The Ambassadors that was owned by Sarah Owen Jewett and then Willa Cather.

35:06.534 --> 35:09.698
And I have a number of books that belong to Willa Cather.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.862
Do you know the Cather-Jewett connection?

35:14.945 --> 35:19.932
Sarah Jewett was her mentor, was her support as a writer.

35:20.974 --> 35:22.015
She's a wonderful writer.

35:24.526 --> 35:32.920
When Willa Cather was editing or working at McClure's magazine, she said, be careful.

35:34.022 --> 35:40.412
Don't bring your wife away on this class, essentially, like you said.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.896
And then she wrote the introduction to The Country of Pointe-Croze.

35:43.958 --> 35:49.487
Does your collection come right into the... Right up to now.

35:50.665 --> 35:51.647
Because I'm a pack rat.

35:51.667 --> 35:55.172
During the 60s and 70s, my involvement in the women's women, I never threw anything out.

35:55.753 --> 36:09.435
So I have, and in fact, I made an exhibition in 19, well, 15 years ago, I made an exhibition commemorating the 10th anniversary of Women's Studies at the University of Massachusetts.

36:10.596 --> 36:18.529
And I used material from the 60s and 70s, which not,

36:18.948 --> 36:24.255
not solely from my own collection, but the archives at UMass and the Sophia Smith collection.

36:24.275 --> 36:25.016
So I go right up.

36:25.076 --> 36:26.418
I don't collect that actively.

36:26.478 --> 36:29.962
I have it because my instincts are to keep everything.

36:30.783 --> 36:34.628
Is it important, however, that the first edition and the final?

36:35.369 --> 36:38.193
I have them because I had them when they were issued.

36:38.253 --> 36:40.256
Are you talking about my early books, the books I collect?

36:40.276 --> 36:42.078
No, I mean the ones with the contemporary books.

36:42.098 --> 36:45.282
I don't collect contemporary books at all.

36:45.342 --> 36:48.246
Well, what I willy-nilly have

36:48.563 --> 36:51.968
is contemporary Sema from the sixties and seventies.

36:52.108 --> 37:01.221
And books that I, of course, fought to read when I became interested in women's things.

37:01.241 --> 37:05.206
Would either of you describe yourselves as bibliomaniacs?

37:05.807 --> 37:07.770
Correct.

37:08.591 --> 37:09.512
Wouldn't you describe it?

37:09.772 --> 37:10.613
Indeed, yeah.

37:10.634 --> 37:13.758
Well, the title of my book, by the way, is Gentle Madness.

37:13.818 --> 37:16.782
Gentle Madness.

37:17.538 --> 37:35.123
I mean, you know, I'm delighted when I buy something that the AAF doesn't have.

37:35.964 --> 37:44.136
And when I get a postcard from Mark McCarson, who says, damn, could we Xerox the title page?

37:45.635 --> 37:51.740
I think his name is Zinman, you know, a collector by the name of Zinman?

37:51.761 --> 37:57.746
He will buy things, and he knows that the AAS doesn't have it.

37:58.346 --> 38:00.328
I don't do that.

38:00.468 --> 38:01.890
You don't have it, right?

38:02.050 --> 38:02.810
I don't do that.

38:02.871 --> 38:03.491
No, no.

38:04.912 --> 38:06.294
No, I don't do that, in fact.

38:06.914 --> 38:08.115
I wouldn't do that.

38:08.135 --> 38:09.557
They've been extremely generous to me.

38:09.577 --> 38:11.678
It's my favorite research library to work in.

38:11.839 --> 38:14.241
It's quite wonderful.

38:14.401 --> 38:15.642
I love it.

38:17.107 --> 38:20.413
any Phyllis Wheatley material, including manuscripts, that I wanted.

38:20.573 --> 38:22.436
But we're both members of you.

38:22.456 --> 38:25.100
We were both just elected, right.

38:25.120 --> 38:42.169
But when I received a postcard from Mark, because I had ordered an item from a book catalog, and I didn't know that I had bought something that the AAS didn't have a copy of complete until I received a very witty postcard from Mark.

38:43.870 --> 38:49.859
cursing me, and then asking for permission to have, could they see my copy in zero?

38:49.919 --> 38:52.402
They look to the long run, too, you know.

38:52.422 --> 38:56.308
Of course, I think they can ask them.

38:56.328 --> 38:58.912
Which brings up another interesting question.

38:59.853 --> 39:01.475
What happens to others?

39:04.360 --> 39:06.302
I think there's some facts in that.

39:07.865 --> 39:08.886
I'll tell you something.

39:09.327 --> 39:11.650
The book about this, you will be discussed.

39:12.423 --> 39:16.988
I'll tell you something very... an interesting, anecdotal story.

39:18.029 --> 39:20.772
When we were moving back to America... Do you want to turn everything off?

39:22.213 --> 39:22.534
I don't know.

39:22.554 --> 39:32.104
It's up to you whether you... It's not, it's not... If you don't want me to use it, by the way, I would have to get releases from you guys at some point anyway.

39:32.224 --> 39:36.328
When we were moving back to America from England, we lived in England for almost 10 years.

39:37.069 --> 39:39.291
This is what you should say.

39:39.507 --> 39:42.852
I didn't imagine that we'd find a place that we could house all our books in.

39:44.053 --> 39:45.776
I didn't know what we were going to be doing with our books.

39:47.598 --> 39:51.103
And I had done... I don't think you should tell this story.

39:51.544 --> 39:51.824
You shouldn't?

39:51.844 --> 39:52.565
Too nasty for them?

39:53.046 --> 39:53.847
Sell it off the record?

39:54.568 --> 39:55.590
I'll shut it off.

39:55.750 --> 39:58.053
Okay.

39:59.495 --> 40:00.797
You know Warren Beck.

40:00.897 --> 40:05.664
This was an empty two-story space with sliding glass doors and windows on that side.

40:05.684 --> 40:07.467
We've been here since 1982 then.

40:07.487 --> 40:07.827
83.

40:10.321 --> 40:17.749
Just in time, at the end of 83, just in time, for the first Jackson campaign.

40:17.829 --> 40:18.690
How do you define that?

40:19.110 --> 40:21.172
Well, I define my life in those terms.

40:21.192 --> 40:21.853
Political terms?

40:22.093 --> 40:22.734
Very, yeah.

40:23.875 --> 40:28.720
I was a delegate from Massachusetts for the convention, the last convention.

40:28.740 --> 40:33.125
I ran a campaign in Western Massachusetts.

40:33.145 --> 40:33.866
A delegate for?

40:33.886 --> 40:34.206
Jackson.

40:34.286 --> 40:34.787
That's what?

40:34.807 --> 40:36.008
Not for Michael, no.

40:39.953 --> 40:43.497
Didn't you know?

40:43.537 --> 40:52.867
We ran a fundraiser for him.

40:52.887 --> 40:57.552
In 1974, before he came and courted me.

40:57.572 --> 40:58.333
Michael did.

40:58.353 --> 41:01.236
And we raised lots of money for him, and he made great speech.

41:02.437 --> 41:03.779
Made lots of promises.

41:03.799 --> 41:05.100
I mean, Cam is, you know,

41:05.570 --> 41:08.332
I'm really very good on one of his reasons.

41:08.433 --> 41:09.293
I'm a very liberal guy.

41:09.313 --> 41:14.138
He got elected, this was his first term as governor, and he did the opposite of everything he said.

41:14.278 --> 41:15.819
So he was actually elected in one of his reasons.

41:15.839 --> 41:17.861
He has a pure, pure opportunity.

41:18.001 --> 41:19.022
He is?

41:19.202 --> 41:24.767
And he's, I hate to say he's a liar.

41:24.787 --> 41:26.508
He's on the tape.

41:26.528 --> 41:29.631
That's always my tape.

41:29.651 --> 41:33.955
See, I define my life in those terms in some ways.

41:33.975 --> 41:34.075
Yeah.

41:35.219 --> 41:36.461
Let's go back to books.

41:36.841 --> 41:45.814
There was one interesting question.

41:48.097 --> 41:59.493
I think when you were pointing out that exquisite book, that you didn't even know existed, but you knew it was wonderful when you saw it and how important it was.

41:59.633 --> 42:01.055
Oh, not to Chris Winterfell.

42:01.075 --> 42:01.496
Which book?

42:02.637 --> 42:04.720
The one with what color?

42:04.970 --> 42:12.221
And you said, try to find something like this and you'll never find it.

42:12.241 --> 42:13.543
Do you know what you're looking for?

42:13.563 --> 42:16.527
I mean, are there gaps in the collection like that?

42:16.547 --> 42:17.248
No, it doesn't work.

42:17.268 --> 42:17.990
Do you really cry?

42:18.050 --> 42:18.550
Do you feel?

42:18.971 --> 42:21.615
Perhaps Lisa has more of a sense of that, I think.

42:23.037 --> 42:27.083
Where a specific book by a specific woman needs to be had.

42:29.407 --> 42:32.351
With me, it's pure serendipitous.

42:32.371 --> 42:33.593
It's a serendipitous event.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.899
It's a serendipitous event for me as well, because nobody's done any of this.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.802
I don't know that they exist.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.405
The scholarship is just happening.

42:42.565 --> 42:44.849
So you're a pioneer, really, in what you're doing.

42:44.869 --> 42:45.409
Yeah.

42:45.430 --> 42:46.131
Oh, absolutely.

42:46.291 --> 42:47.052
Absolutely.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.236
There's very little work.

42:49.256 --> 42:55.526
I mean, the whole burgeoning women's studies thing is really a very recent piece of good.

42:55.966 --> 42:56.948
I mean, it's the past...

42:57.586 --> 42:58.407
15 years.

42:58.547 --> 43:06.579
Can we say, and we can discuss it later, that you offered this library to a school without identifying it?

43:06.699 --> 43:07.661
I don't think we should.

43:07.761 --> 43:11.006
It's not really.

43:11.066 --> 43:13.429
But let's not look at it from that negative side.

43:13.449 --> 43:14.851
How about the positive side?

43:14.871 --> 43:21.000
Do you think at some point we'll have a home in an institution?

43:21.020 --> 43:22.142
Except for the children, I think.

43:23.995 --> 43:24.917
I hope it will.

43:25.157 --> 43:32.570
You know, the trouble is that certainly, well, at this point, one of the kids is extremely interested in involvement.

43:32.590 --> 43:33.071
That's great.

43:33.952 --> 43:34.994
And who knows?

43:35.835 --> 43:37.739
I mean, what a great start this would be.

43:37.879 --> 43:39.261
Great start for a new job.

43:40.203 --> 43:44.210
My wife thinks, you know, we've got to open up books.

43:44.230 --> 43:47.235
I mean, it would be very nice.

43:47.941 --> 43:57.817
I mean, I have thought that the collection should be kept, the women's collection should be kept intact, and it should go to an institution, an institution that really would benefit from having the books.

43:57.857 --> 44:11.520
An institution like Spelman in Atlanta, or... It's a sort of a collection that you couldn't put together with any... I mean, you can put half of it together, but the other half isn't unique, I think.

44:11.540 --> 44:14.725
My script material, the ephemeral material material.

44:16.460 --> 44:18.283
You know, it's interesting.

44:18.303 --> 44:21.068
You go back to David Redden's quote with a hundred million dollars.

44:22.149 --> 44:27.438
But a hundred million dollars assumes the stuff is available.

44:28.079 --> 44:29.361
You can buy a great library.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.545
You could formulate a wonderful library.

44:31.605 --> 44:36.072
I mean, if you gave me a hundred million dollars now, I would go out and buy a wonderful book.

44:36.220 --> 44:40.665
But I wouldn't necessarily be able to find everything that we have.

44:40.826 --> 44:45.251
You didn't replicate what you had, particularly in your grace.

44:45.331 --> 44:48.655
Well, and neither, neither.

44:48.675 --> 44:50.938
In the ephemeral, that tends to be so scarce.

44:51.719 --> 44:55.042
I mean, the Library of Congress calls upon these— No, not the Library of Congress.

44:55.063 --> 44:59.308
The Stanton Anthony paper says the Library of Congress was not complete.

44:59.328 --> 45:05.034
If they could Xerox, some of her journals, have complete their— No, no, no, no, you have it wrong.

45:05.054 --> 45:05.535
You have it wrong.

45:05.650 --> 45:07.934
Well, I thought, I'd like to get that right, though.

45:07.954 --> 45:08.715
That's interesting.

45:08.735 --> 45:08.856
Yeah.

45:08.876 --> 45:21.558
I have, we own a, the most complete run of the revolution, which was a newspaper that was published by Stephen B. Anthony and Parker Killsbury in the 19th century.

45:21.939 --> 45:30.814
And I've been working on and off over the years as a consultant for the Stanton Anthony Papers Project, which is located at the University of Massachusetts and Amory.

45:31.469 --> 45:36.574
And they are doing a complete microfilm edition of all the manuscript material and printed material.

45:36.594 --> 45:37.355
This is your stuff.

45:37.375 --> 45:38.556
No, it's not all my stuff.

45:38.576 --> 45:39.077
But I mean... No, no.

45:40.038 --> 45:55.633
But... It turns out that as they were searching for copies of The Revolution for microfilms, places that thought they had it complete, like the Sufriessness question, were not complete.

45:55.653 --> 45:59.637
And the missing issues were... I didn't want them to use my whole...

46:00.325 --> 46:06.011
But they took the missing issues from my part of the revolution, for the Microfilm edition.

46:06.111 --> 46:06.432
Oh, yes.

46:06.452 --> 46:08.694
Interesting.

46:08.974 --> 46:09.995
I'm sorry.

46:10.376 --> 46:12.778
How do they find out about you?

46:12.798 --> 46:14.480
How do these places like this work?

46:14.540 --> 46:20.227
Well, I've worked with, well, the Stanton Anthony Papers Project are the people that I've been working with.

46:20.247 --> 46:20.887
So they know.

46:20.907 --> 46:23.951
So it's a small network, in other words.

46:24.251 --> 46:29.016
I bought a few years ago two letters of Susan B. Anthony.

46:30.194 --> 46:32.416
You can publish this.

46:32.937 --> 46:34.178
This is interesting.

46:34.198 --> 46:38.902
I wrote two letters from a Texas book dealer, not Jenkins, of Susan B. Anthony.

46:38.923 --> 46:40.264
They're wonderfully interesting letters.

46:40.364 --> 46:43.487
They're early Anthony letters.

46:43.707 --> 46:47.211
They are about the suffrage campaign in the Midwest.

46:47.871 --> 46:54.057
They had belonged to a historical society and a library in Kansas.

46:54.077 --> 46:56.860
And that collection then went to the

46:57.582 --> 47:04.890
University of Washington Library, no, the State Library of the State of Washington and Lindsay Washington.

47:04.910 --> 47:18.464
I bought two letters at a book viewer's, and I automatically, when I get letters of, there are certain sites that are recording, like all of them are Goldman's letters are being worked on in California, Stanton Anthony's letters are being worked on here.

47:18.504 --> 47:22.108
So I sent Xeroxes to the editors.

47:22.308 --> 47:26.172
The editors, one of them called me and said, I've got bad news for you.

47:26.489 --> 47:29.652
She said, well, the two letters that you bought are stolen.

47:32.614 --> 47:36.077
And they knew where the letters were from, who owned the letters.

47:36.137 --> 47:41.122
They were stolen from the Library of the State of Washington.

47:41.142 --> 47:47.868
So they wrote a letter to the librarians of the State Library, who wrote back to them.

47:48.168 --> 47:53.713
And ultimately, the resolution is no resolution that the State Library is very delighted that they're in a safe place, period.

47:53.733 --> 47:54.954
They've never pursued the letters.

47:54.974 --> 47:56.395
Isn't that interesting?

47:57.235 --> 47:59.778
So this went on for a year.

47:59.798 --> 48:00.619
This went on for a year.

48:00.679 --> 48:06.546
I still owed the dealer, you know, 200 bucks, because these were not inexpensive letters.

48:06.566 --> 48:11.652
And I didn't pay him the rest of the balance until I knew that I owned the letters.

48:11.692 --> 48:12.594
So I owned the letters.

48:12.914 --> 48:15.497
Did anyone ever ask where he got the letters?

48:15.617 --> 48:19.402
The person, the thief has already, there were two of them.

48:20.403 --> 48:22.045
They've stolen many other things.

48:22.413 --> 48:25.077
and one of them was serving time.

48:25.398 --> 48:28.983
But the interesting thing is that the librarian was delighted that there were anything found.

48:29.043 --> 48:32.328
The librarian made no move to recover the stolen goods.

48:33.049 --> 48:34.552
He took the problem out of his hand.

48:35.313 --> 48:36.194
Never heard that.

48:36.214 --> 48:44.046
Have you ever become, I hesitate to use the word apathetic, but bored with the collection?

48:44.066 --> 48:44.367
No.

48:45.709 --> 48:48.353
Roger started it at the local library at Harvard.

48:49.430 --> 48:52.175
He's the editor of Bostonia, I've changed for Richard Stone.

48:52.195 --> 48:56.503
I don't think it was the embarrassment of that piece that I would.

48:56.823 --> 48:57.765
His name is Roger Stein.

48:57.825 --> 48:59.448
We'll tell you a nice Roger Stein.

48:59.468 --> 49:00.289
He's wonderful.

49:01.311 --> 49:03.996
He said he'd be interested in knowing why some people stopped collecting

49:04.313 --> 49:06.616
as much as to know why they start.

49:07.017 --> 49:08.179
Do lots of people stop?

49:08.239 --> 49:08.699
Well, a few.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.202
I mean, Houghton, I think.

49:10.743 --> 49:11.924
Yeah, that belittered me.

49:11.944 --> 49:13.206
Well, Hornblood is another one.

49:13.386 --> 49:14.508
We were at that sale.

49:14.528 --> 49:15.009
At the Houghton.

49:15.029 --> 49:19.375
And he was there, and we watched him rubbing his hands and counting the shackles.

49:19.395 --> 49:20.858
And Roger did not mention Houghton, by the way.

49:20.918 --> 49:21.518
I mentioned Houghton.

49:21.539 --> 49:22.740
He didn't mention a few others.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.663
Why didn't he give it to the Houghton?

49:24.683 --> 49:26.045
Well, he gave him the building, I guess.

49:26.065 --> 49:26.846
He doesn't need the money.

49:27.147 --> 49:27.347
No.

49:27.648 --> 49:28.909
And he's still around, I guess.

49:29.010 --> 49:31.333
In fact, he's working on the next anniversary.

49:31.820 --> 49:36.146
Roger is exceedingly discreet, and he never mentioned after Houghton.

49:36.166 --> 49:45.818
But when he brought that up, it's true to me, Houghton, the man whose name, you know, who's building his name for it, is probably the greatest example of that.

49:48.402 --> 49:53.969
Houghton owns a copy, when I was doing the Wheatley exhibition, Houghton owns a copy of Paradise Lost.

49:54.009 --> 49:55.451
Owns or owns, he still owns?

49:56.232 --> 49:58.275
Houghton's library.

49:58.435 --> 49:59.937
The library owns a copy of

50:01.874 --> 50:11.484
No, the library owned a copy of Paradise Lost that was, what would you like?

50:11.504 --> 50:11.725
No, just .

50:11.785 --> 50:12.025
.

50:12.065 --> 50:12.205
.

50:12.285 --> 50:12.405
.

50:12.505 --> 50:12.666
.

50:12.686 --> 50:12.806
.

50:12.826 --> 50:12.846
.

50:12.866 --> 50:12.886
.

50:12.906 --> 50:12.926
.

50:12.946 --> 50:12.966
.

50:12.986 --> 50:13.106
.

50:13.126 --> 50:13.326
.

50:13.346 --> 50:13.587
.

50:13.627 --> 50:13.967
.

50:13.987 --> 50:14.528
.

50:14.548 --> 50:14.808
.

50:14.848 --> 50:15.068
.

50:15.088 --> 50:15.248
.

50:15.369 --> 50:15.629
.

50:15.649 --> 50:16.530
.

50:16.550 --> 50:16.710
.

50:17.191 --> 50:17.211
.

50:17.231 --> 50:17.251
.

50:17.271 --> 50:17.711
.

50:17.731 --> 50:18.892
.

50:18.912 --> 50:18.932
.

50:18.952 --> 50:18.972
.

50:18.993 --> 50:19.153
.

50:19.173 --> 50:19.193
.

50:19.213 --> 50:19.233
.

50:19.253 --> 50:19.273
.

50:19.293 --> 50:19.693
.

50:19.713 --> 50:20.254
.

50:20.274 --> 50:20.294
.

50:20.414 --> 50:20.754
.

50:20.774 --> 50:21.255
.

50:21.275 --> 50:21.615
.

50:22.136 --> 50:22.596
.

50:22.636 --> 50:22.917
.

50:22.957 --> 50:23.177
.

50:23.197 --> 50:24.258
.

50:24.318 --> 50:24.338
.

50:24.358 --> 50:24.498
.

50:24.518 --> 50:25.159
.

50:25.179 --> 50:25.820
.

50:25.860 --> 50:26.000
.

50:26.020 --> 50:26.260
.

50:26.380 --> 50:26.501
.

50:26.521 --> 50:27.742
.

50:27.762 --> 50:28.122
.

50:28.142 --> 50:28.383
.

50:28.403 --> 50:28.423
.

50:28.463 --> 50:28.483
.

50:28.503 --> 50:28.523
.

50:28.543 --> 50:28.863
.

50:28.883 --> 50:29.184
.

50:29.204 --> 50:29.224
.

50:30.285 --> 50:30.565
.

50:31.203 --> 50:41.298
a man called Watson, who you would know as Watson and the Shark, you know, the great Copley painting of the man in the water with his leg off.

50:41.318 --> 50:42.200
That's Watson.

50:42.220 --> 50:42.560
Really?

50:42.640 --> 50:42.941
Right.

50:42.961 --> 50:45.625
And he's being rescued by a black man on the rest.

50:45.745 --> 50:46.045
Okay.

50:46.386 --> 50:49.711
Watson met Wheatley in London and presented her with a copy.

50:49.811 --> 50:50.252
He was the Lord Mayor.

50:50.272 --> 50:50.552
No, no, no.

50:50.572 --> 50:52.275
He was not yet the Lord Mayor.

50:52.796 --> 50:53.216
Sorry, Lenny.

50:54.178 --> 50:56.121
He became the Lord Mayor of London.

50:56.141 --> 50:57.543
He was not very good politically.

50:57.583 --> 50:58.324
He was lousy.

50:58.928 --> 51:02.834
But he gave Phyllis Wheatley a copy of Milton's Paradise Law.

51:04.456 --> 51:07.561
And after Wheatley's death... With a nice inscription.

51:07.921 --> 51:08.202
Right.

51:08.222 --> 51:12.888
After Wheatley's death, her husband sold the copy at Houghton.

51:12.908 --> 51:19.638
And I wanted to borrow that, the Lovely Association copy, for my exhibition.

51:19.718 --> 51:24.606
Here's the speculation, of course, did he meet her, did he have this... That is nice.

51:24.626 --> 51:27.670
...because of her being a young black woman.

51:27.835 --> 51:30.398
He had been rescued by a black person, et cetera, et cetera.

51:30.839 --> 51:32.721
So I wanted to borrow the copy from Houghton.

51:32.741 --> 51:38.709
I mean, they have, in the card catalog, they have inches of copies of Paradise Law.

51:38.849 --> 51:40.331
This is not a first edition.

51:40.351 --> 51:41.673
This is not, you know.

51:41.713 --> 51:42.774
Association copies.

51:42.794 --> 51:48.542
So Roger didn't want to lend me the copy because it was in a very shaky binding.

51:49.483 --> 51:52.527
And I thought, well, maybe we could have the binding restored.

51:53.401 --> 51:57.467
If it went out, we could give it to somebody who does our binding restation.

51:57.507 --> 51:58.809
But it was really an enormous task.

51:58.869 --> 51:59.630
It was a folio.

52:01.072 --> 52:02.715
And he was dittering and dittering.

52:03.236 --> 52:10.246
And he wasn't going to lend me the copy until we made an agreement.

52:10.527 --> 52:11.688
We shouldn't publish this either.

52:11.848 --> 52:15.133
That Leonard would make him a drawing of Phyllis Wheatley.

52:15.234 --> 52:17.938
And I got my little... That's not a bad story.

52:17.958 --> 52:18.919
I don't think he can use, but...

52:19.321 --> 52:21.685
I don't think he'd like to see it published.

52:21.885 --> 52:32.081
Right, and I got to borrow... The book is 90,000 words, so trust me, it's... I was able to borrow the... We'll go over his stuff, by the way.

52:32.482 --> 52:39.853
I'm going to transcribe the Britain stuff, and, you know, I expect that we're going to have to sign off on some things.

52:39.933 --> 52:45.142
I don't know, but, you know, there will be no surprises in this book.

52:45.262 --> 52:45.362
Okay.

52:46.085 --> 52:47.610
That's a sweet story.

52:47.650 --> 52:48.633
That's a great story.

52:48.653 --> 52:49.816
So is that what happened?

52:49.836 --> 52:50.358
I borrowed it.

52:50.378 --> 52:51.903
He got a wonderful drawing.

52:51.983 --> 52:54.972
I am going to turn this tape around because I know it's about to run out and everything.

52:54.992 --> 52:57.259
I'm just getting anxious.
