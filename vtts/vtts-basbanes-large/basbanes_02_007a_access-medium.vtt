00:02.849 --> 00:04.010
Tobias Wolfe.

00:04.591 --> 00:06.072
This is a wonderful new collection.

00:06.533 --> 00:07.313
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.174
Congratulations.

00:08.234 --> 00:12.278
And it is 15 years between story collections, isn't it?

00:12.879 --> 00:13.500
Are there abouts?

00:13.780 --> 00:14.220
About 10.

00:14.841 --> 00:15.301
Is it 10?

00:15.622 --> 00:16.222
Yeah.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.984
Wait a minute.

00:18.004 --> 00:18.324
11.

00:18.504 --> 00:21.728
It was the fall of 85 when Back in the World came out.

00:21.848 --> 00:22.228
Okay.

00:22.248 --> 00:22.989
Exactly 11 years.

00:23.069 --> 00:25.271
So what does this say?

00:25.331 --> 00:26.272
Or does it say anything?

00:27.053 --> 00:30.016
Well, I have never stopped working on stories.

00:30.216 --> 00:30.977
I love stories.

00:31.838 --> 00:32.198
They're...

00:32.515 --> 00:41.628
You know, when a story comes upon me, I can't resist it.

00:41.648 --> 00:42.569
I have to write it.

00:43.731 --> 00:59.133
So in the time that I was writing my last two books, This Boy's Life and In Pharaoh's Army, I would leave off from Tysaton to write a story that demanded to be written.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.835
So something would start...

01:01.304 --> 01:08.914
Some notion would start growing in me and distracting me from the work at hand, and then I'd leave off for a little while and write it.

01:08.974 --> 01:17.986
In that way, I wrote many stories over the last ten years, probably about half of which appear in this volume.

01:18.307 --> 01:20.950
The other half I wasn't really...

01:21.942 --> 01:27.747
All that, you know, just because you feel like you have to write a story doesn't mean it's going to be good when you finish it.

01:27.768 --> 01:28.288
That's a great line.

01:28.308 --> 01:33.693
But I like these stories, and they seem to me to fit comfortably together.

01:33.733 --> 01:40.139
So that is the... What argues for them to fit comfortably together?

01:40.439 --> 01:41.661
Maybe that's not phrased.

01:41.921 --> 01:46.585
It's an instinct of my own, in a sense that I guess maybe I could describe it this way.

01:46.605 --> 01:49.468
I can imagine all these people...

01:51.895 --> 02:03.108
inhabiting the same world, I can imagine all these people crossing paths at one time or another, though they don't in the book.

02:03.128 --> 02:07.953
That there's some plane of existence that they all share.

02:10.937 --> 02:21.008
It isn't a question of there being a single kind of...

02:21.848 --> 02:29.899
moral or spiritual issue behind each of the stories, the way, say, is the case in Flannery O'Connor.

02:30.560 --> 02:44.419
I think of it more, I guess, like Dubliners, which has a sense of people sharing a kind of common ground of existence.

02:44.439 --> 02:49.847
And that is how I think of the stories in this collection and the people in the stories.

02:50.873 --> 03:01.972
You know, you told me when I was out there for the PW interview that you were very briefly a reporter and that you were a failure as a reporter.

03:01.992 --> 03:03.254
Yeah, I wasn't a good one.

03:03.274 --> 03:06.560
And I'm wondering if the opening story here kind of draws on that.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.463
It does.

03:08.603 --> 03:09.906
Oh, absolutely.

03:10.246 --> 03:11.408
Absolutely, it certainly does.

03:11.428 --> 03:12.510
Yes, I was...

03:13.756 --> 03:21.244
Obviously, I have elaborated somewhat on the incident that impelled the story in the first place, but I brooded over it for years.

03:22.005 --> 03:25.549
I did, in fact, write an obituary of a man who was not dead.

03:26.430 --> 03:38.363
I got into trouble for it because we were supposed to go through certain steps when we got a report of a death, and I didn't follow them.

03:38.933 --> 04:04.232
I just took that. I just took the obituary base, you know the information from the people, who just trying. I know the truth. Uh the paper ran and then they were very cross about the whole thing as you can imagine, but it didn't follow the liniments of the you know the. No it's but is that almost the kind of a uh a newsroom uh apocryphal story, I wonder about? I'm not going to give it away in any way because it's

04:04.212 --> 04:05.414
It caught me.

04:05.434 --> 04:10.863
I mean, it almost hits him like an insight.

04:11.024 --> 04:13.127
It may have happened to others, but it certainly happened.

04:13.147 --> 04:15.491
I remember a guy called in his own obit, I guess, is the thing.

04:17.194 --> 04:24.246
To tell you the truth, I always suspected that other reporters did it as a joke.

04:25.424 --> 04:26.066
A joke.

04:26.086 --> 04:30.919
I mean, a guy really could get fired from that.

04:31.260 --> 04:33.586
I know.

04:33.726 --> 04:34.869
It's a good story.

04:34.889 --> 04:39.923
The only thing that I...

04:41.303 --> 04:43.406
Yeah, that's right, exactly.

04:43.907 --> 04:59.930
But anyway, one thing I do like about it, and it seems to be consistent with all the stories, is that there are these epiphanous moments, you know, these flashes of insight, which you really have to, you know, think of when you're writing a story, I could imagine.

05:00.171 --> 05:10.686
There's not this leisure time available to develop these... Are these moments kind of in view when you're writing these stories, or do they more or less...

05:11.375 --> 05:19.283
Well, by the time I come to write the last draft of the story, everything is pretty much in view.

05:19.864 --> 05:27.192
But it isn't always the case that I'm aware when I begin writing a story, just exactly where it's going to go.

05:28.533 --> 05:38.123
It will often just be set in motion by... well, by very different things.

05:38.343 --> 05:40.065
One is the...

05:40.552 --> 05:47.721
The most recent story I've written, which is not in the collection, it was actually started in motion by a dream I had.

05:48.502 --> 05:49.564
That I rarely do.

05:49.644 --> 05:53.309
I know a lot of writers very much depend on their dreams, like Paul Bowles does.

05:54.350 --> 05:58.896
That hasn't been something that's figured largely in my work, but in this last story it did.

05:59.377 --> 06:02.841
Sometimes I'll start from something that's very close to my own experience.

06:03.742 --> 06:05.665
Sometimes I'll start from something I've heard.

06:06.455 --> 06:09.059
that for some reason or other I can't let go of.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.160
I just worry at it.

06:10.220 --> 06:11.001
It works on me.

06:11.041 --> 06:14.246
And then finally I have put down whatever else I'm doing and I start writing it.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.128
And I'm not always sure where it's going to lead.

06:17.049 --> 06:22.537
And indeed, if I do know where it's going to lead, it actually goes there.

06:23.278 --> 06:25.741
It's usually not a very good story when I finish it.

06:26.082 --> 06:32.470
That's almost surely a sign to me that it's not going to be a good story, that everything goes according to plan.

06:33.712 --> 06:33.812
Yeah.

06:34.265 --> 06:42.957
In that first draft, I really, in my own case, I'm not sure this is true for other writers, but it is certainly true for me.

06:44.019 --> 06:50.768
I almost need for the story to surprise me in the writing.

06:51.950 --> 06:58.299
Otherwise, it just doesn't have that freshness that I'm looking for.

06:59.180 --> 07:02.905
Paul Stevens once said, no surprise for the writer, no surprise for the reader.

07:03.678 --> 07:04.479
I believe that.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.826
That has certainly been borne out in my own experience.

07:09.926 --> 07:24.745
I write with a wide open... I mean, it's kind of terrifying because it's obviously much more reassuring to a writer to feel... for writers to feel that they know where they're going when they're writing, know exactly where they're going.

07:26.707 --> 07:32.875
On the other hand, I think that you close yourself off from all kinds of possibilities when you write in that frame of mind.

07:33.361 --> 07:47.985
Now, when I've put a story through several drafts, then by the time, obviously, I'm starting at the beginning and I'm going to go all the way through to the end, then for the last time I know pretty much why every comma is going where it is.

07:48.005 --> 07:49.787
But not when I first start writing a story.

07:50.068 --> 07:56.378
It's pretty exciting, isn't it, that stories as a form remain vibrant at this point?

07:56.398 --> 07:56.919
It sure is for me.

07:57.079 --> 08:00.685
I don't know whether that's true...

08:01.289 --> 08:03.912
in the world at large.

08:05.575 --> 08:15.928
I think there's a hard core of aficionados out there and a very loyal constituency.

08:15.968 --> 08:18.231
The short story has a very loyal constituency.

08:19.273 --> 08:21.536
But it's not a large one, I think.

08:21.736 --> 08:22.977
That's my sense.

08:23.018 --> 08:27.744
I know publishers are always telling me how miserable they are when they see a short story coming.

08:27.844 --> 08:30.267
I mean, not my publisher, but I...

08:31.208 --> 08:58.633
I know that when young writers of my acquaintance are writing short stories and submit a collection to a publisher, they almost always ask if they can not have a novel first to publish and to bring the stories out on the back of it, which indicates to me that my enthusiasm and my excitement about the short story is not necessarily shared by the public at large.

08:59.862 --> 09:00.443
So what?

09:00.483 --> 09:03.330
I mean, that's been true of poetry for hundreds of years.

09:03.350 --> 09:07.840
Well, even more so, my interview for this week is with Neil Simon.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.523
I said, what do you tell young playwrights?

09:09.984 --> 09:10.245
Wow.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.212
He said, what I tell him is don't do it.

09:15.637 --> 09:16.779
He told me a cute story.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.305
This is Neil Simon.

09:19.775 --> 09:24.804
He thought he'd like to teach a course for a year, and he called Stanford University because he's living out in L.A.

09:24.844 --> 09:25.445
and it's close.

09:25.565 --> 09:30.094
And he said, would you be interested in my teaching a course in playwriting?

09:30.114 --> 09:31.817
They said, wow, they'd be overwhelmed.

09:32.718 --> 09:36.084
And he said, just out of curiosity, how many people do you think would take it?

09:36.746 --> 09:37.968
They called back three days later.

09:38.008 --> 09:40.332
They said, we can get five students.

09:41.088 --> 09:42.830
And he said, what if it's screenwriting?

09:42.850 --> 09:43.411
He said, oh, 200.

09:43.711 --> 09:44.572
They said 200.

09:45.093 --> 09:51.961
You know, everybody wants to go into screenwriting now, but the point is, you know, who is writing plays?

09:52.021 --> 09:58.529
And, of course, when you think about how difficult it is to stage one, you know, I mean, why bother at that point?

09:58.850 --> 10:02.815
Well, and also the prevailing fashion in plays.

10:02.835 --> 10:06.960
So, you know, it's all these revivals.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.643
It's...

10:10.163 --> 10:21.082
rather crass, epic-scale musicals, the dramatic, so to speak, literary play as a vanishing species.

10:21.103 --> 10:21.424
Really?

10:22.267 --> 10:22.367
Yeah.

10:23.140 --> 10:30.811
Now, I asked him, you know, because it is pertinent in his case, because he's written for television, he's written for the movies, and he writes plays.

10:31.032 --> 10:39.344
And I asked him when he writes, and I think it's pertinent to the discussion you and I have just had, do you see your audience?

10:39.364 --> 10:41.847
Do you have an image of the person who you're writing for?

10:41.887 --> 10:43.630
So for TV, I don't have a clue.

10:43.610 --> 10:48.194
He said, it's 22 million sitting in the garage drinking beer, for all I know.

10:48.235 --> 10:52.399
The Maurice comes down a little bit more.

10:52.439 --> 10:59.345
He said, well, when it comes to a play, I'm thinking of about 1,000 very intelligent people on Broadway.

11:00.186 --> 11:02.929
And it's a tough audience, and I'm writing for them.

11:03.029 --> 11:08.034
I wonder if that applies when you mentioned that there is kind of a hardcore readership for stories.

11:08.414 --> 11:10.656
Are you thinking of the reader when you're writing these stories?

11:10.676 --> 11:13.279
I'm thinking of...

11:13.816 --> 11:16.780
To tell you the truth, the reader I'm thinking of is myself.

11:17.821 --> 11:22.247
I have no idea how someone else reads.

11:22.547 --> 11:30.257
So what I have to ask is, would I like this story, would I like this sentence if I read it?

11:32.039 --> 11:42.372
Obviously, there's a gamble inherent in that kind of a question because you're perhaps more inclined to like your work than someone else might be.

11:42.773 --> 11:46.419
But on the other hand, how could I ask that question from someone else's point of view?

11:48.442 --> 11:50.184
I'm a very demanding reader.

11:50.224 --> 11:54.451
I'm also a reader who takes delight in the short story.

11:55.713 --> 12:02.483
And I wouldn't want to write for anyone less demanding than I am.

12:02.643 --> 12:04.326
I wouldn't want to write down to people.

12:04.897 --> 12:10.404
And I don't know how to write to someone more intelligent than me because I'm not more intelligent than me.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.446
Do you know what I mean?

12:12.586 --> 12:13.387
Of course.

12:13.608 --> 12:18.394
How can I imagine somebody who's more demanding and more intelligent?

12:19.114 --> 12:22.579
It's just that it isn't egomaniac.

12:22.599 --> 12:25.302
It's simply that my imagination and my intelligence

12:25.687 --> 12:27.993
basically sealing out at my level.

12:28.895 --> 12:33.246
And so I try to write at the highest level that I am capable of.

12:36.313 --> 12:41.025
You know, I mean, I've asked this question of, say, Marilyn French.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.970
Well, she knows who she's writing for.

12:43.338 --> 12:45.382
You know, she can almost visualize her reader.

12:46.785 --> 12:54.581
Mary Carr, you know, your friend, can almost visualize her reader for that wonderful book of hers.

12:57.106 --> 12:57.727
Lovely book.

12:58.689 --> 13:02.477
Nice woman, I have to say.

13:02.457 --> 13:05.381
I guess, you know, we call them stories.

13:05.461 --> 13:06.803
It is storytelling, isn't it?

13:06.843 --> 13:12.249
Maybe you could just muse briefly on the craft of, on the art of storytelling.

13:13.331 --> 13:20.099
I guess undoubtedly it does retain its vibrancy, you know, as we approach the end of this millennium.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.003
I mean, it is a timeless thing, isn't it?

13:23.744 --> 13:24.405
Storytelling.

13:24.585 --> 13:25.967
Yeah, absolutely.

13:26.007 --> 13:26.828
I think...

13:27.550 --> 13:28.171
at its root.

13:28.191 --> 13:29.933
That's what writing is, isn't it, I guess?

13:29.953 --> 13:30.634
Absolutely, yeah.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.157
It's certainly how it started.

13:32.197 --> 13:44.434
It's one of the most natural things to us to tell stories, and it's the sign of health in a person to me that they tell stories.

13:45.376 --> 13:53.828
It's a sign of their interest in the world and the peculiarities of their fellow humans and

13:54.719 --> 14:00.227
in a way of understanding what goes on between people is in story.

14:00.527 --> 14:07.237
It's the pleasure in the actual as opposed to the abstract.

14:08.518 --> 14:13.625
What really goes on between folk?

14:13.646 --> 14:21.697
And how does this web of circumstance we find ourselves in come to mean something?

14:21.757 --> 14:23.219
That's the other thing story does.

14:23.319 --> 14:24.000
Just being on...

14:24.318 --> 14:35.980
What the story does in just our day-to-day life is give us a way of organizing experience so that it has meaning and coherence for us.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.951
And the literary story, I think, does that even more.

14:42.091 --> 14:46.680
It takes it out of the realm of anecdote, which is where most of our spoken stories lie.

14:47.352 --> 15:16.093
in which to simply recount the events and the amusing shape of events or the interesting shape of an event is sufficient, but to really plumb a pattern of experience, a pattern of behavior and, you know, again, what goes on between people for all that it can yield in the way of meaning and poetry, you know, what kind of

15:16.259 --> 15:27.013
what the best language is that can be brought to bear to express that circumstance and those personalities.

15:27.574 --> 15:32.180
Then you have a, you know, you've moved the story on to another level.

15:32.621 --> 15:41.693
And, of course, that's my concern in this book, and it's the concern of the short story writer to do that.

15:42.533 --> 15:49.325
There does seem to be a moral center to all of the stories.

15:49.605 --> 15:52.931
Do you agree with that, number one?

15:52.971 --> 15:58.581
And number two, is that an essential element for you in writing these stories, or any story?

15:59.062 --> 16:02.408
Well, I can't imagine not doing it.

16:02.528 --> 16:07.697
I mean, that is so true for me, that

16:08.251 --> 16:11.294
It isn't really that I even think about it that much when I'm doing it.

16:11.354 --> 16:12.095
It's natural.

16:14.478 --> 16:24.068
It is what we all do all the time is try to figure out the best course of the many that are at any given moment open to us.

16:25.209 --> 16:28.813
We find ourselves always in a web of community.

16:29.354 --> 16:34.920
We find ourselves in a web of friendship, family, community.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.123
We find ourselves connected and responsible.

16:38.761 --> 16:58.164
And the moral sense is what suggests to us the best way to honor those connections in completely imperfect circumstances where no matter what you do, something is not going to be as it should.

16:58.324 --> 17:06.714
I mean, complete fulfillment of all responsibilities simultaneously is impossible.

17:06.834 --> 17:07.755
So there's always...

17:08.326 --> 17:13.675
a kind of triage going on in one's moral life.

17:14.597 --> 17:26.678
And not to reckon that as part of, you know, as it's constantly going on in our own lives, for that not to find its way into one's fiction would seem odd to me.

17:26.798 --> 17:33.490
It would be to exclude what is at the heart of so much of what we do and what we think about.

17:34.752 --> 17:44.184
So it isn't necessarily that I set out to write a moral story, but I guess that consciousness of what goes on in us all the time inevitably finds its way into the stories.

17:46.147 --> 17:50.212
Does this collection reflect where you are in your life professionally?

17:51.313 --> 17:51.954
Professionally?

17:52.074 --> 17:52.174
Yeah.

17:52.695 --> 17:53.095
What do you mean?

17:53.356 --> 18:04.590
Well, looking at your body of work, say, as a corpus, and you've done these two wonderful memoirs, you are back now in the form that...

18:05.110 --> 18:06.592
that everybody knows you.

18:06.612 --> 18:15.100
Well, I guess most readers know you probably for your memoirs, but truly you are one of our great story writers.

18:15.180 --> 18:20.706
I'm just wondering, I guess, in terms of development, progression, you know, where you are with you.

18:20.746 --> 18:26.853
Well, I think the best of this, I mean, I hope that the best of the stories in this book are my best stories.

18:28.074 --> 18:34.881
One always hopes that, that the most recent work somehow represents you at your best and shows you...

18:35.030 --> 18:40.737
as having grown since your last book.

18:41.778 --> 18:45.022
And I'm very happy with the stories in this book.

18:46.544 --> 18:48.867
But they don't represent a resting place for me.

18:48.967 --> 18:58.659
I'm thinking now about a much longer project that I have had in mind for years, and that will be the next thing I do.

18:58.719 --> 19:01.122
And I will no doubt continue to write stories

19:02.114 --> 19:08.984
over the years as I do this other project, as I did during the writing of the last two books.

19:09.004 --> 19:13.109
But, I mean, Graham Greene is my model in this.

19:13.129 --> 19:13.730
Oh, great.

19:13.750 --> 19:18.377
He continued to write short stories as he was writing his novels.

19:18.397 --> 19:23.644
And, you know, between novels and even while he was working on novels.

19:23.724 --> 19:27.449
And they're good stories.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.753
In fact, they're wonderful stories, Graham Greene's stories.

19:29.973 --> 19:30.754
And...

19:31.038 --> 19:34.202
And I would hope to be able to continue to do that myself.

19:34.442 --> 19:35.904
Well, you mentioned a longer project.

19:35.924 --> 19:36.885
Are we talking about a novel?

19:37.365 --> 19:37.606
Yes.

19:39.868 --> 19:41.009
It's a work in progress?

19:41.430 --> 19:44.073
It is.

19:44.694 --> 19:46.396
I'm being very vague here.

19:47.216 --> 19:50.600
You could say that it's a work in progress.

19:50.881 --> 19:51.842
And you're excited about it?

19:52.022 --> 19:53.103
Yes, I am.

19:53.123 --> 19:54.044
Good.

19:54.445 --> 19:56.587
Any projections as to when we might?

19:57.328 --> 19:57.749
No.

19:57.769 --> 19:58.349
That's good.

19:58.389 --> 20:00.211
So there's no pressure on yourself?

20:00.271 --> 20:00.792
No, no, no.

20:01.480 --> 20:08.649
And then briefly, not only selecting the stories, but organizing them.

20:09.830 --> 20:12.153
There is a unity to them, I can see.

20:12.173 --> 20:18.160
Is that something you do or that you do with Gary or you work on it collaboratively or what?

20:18.180 --> 20:19.481
You mean the order?

20:19.521 --> 20:20.723
Yeah, the order.

20:21.304 --> 20:21.544
Yeah.

20:21.884 --> 20:22.505
Well, that's funny.

20:22.545 --> 20:24.527
I mean, Gary and I laugh about this.

20:24.988 --> 20:29.293
I sent in my stories in a certain order that I thought worked well.

20:29.763 --> 20:37.753
He made a couple of suggestions to me that I thought were good, and we changed the order of a few of the stories.

20:39.475 --> 20:46.323
By and large, he thought that my ordering of them made sense and gave a good emotional pacing to the work.

20:46.684 --> 20:48.166
And you think a lot about the order.

20:48.686 --> 20:57.357
As I was saying, you want to imagine these people inhabiting some kind of common ground, and

20:57.725 --> 21:06.418
And the sense of their lives being revealed, you want that to have an almost dramatic pace, as it would in a novel.

21:08.021 --> 21:13.970
And you want the stories to kind of talk to each other and play off against each other in a certain way.

21:13.990 --> 21:14.992
So it's very important.

21:15.032 --> 21:18.417
But having said that, I also know that readers generally...

21:18.802 --> 21:21.405
don't respect the order of a short story collection.

21:21.425 --> 21:25.089
And I say this because I don't myself do that.

21:25.710 --> 21:26.391
I'm terrible.

21:26.411 --> 21:36.582
When I pick up a short story collection, even knowing what I go through to order it, when I do my first reading of a collection of stories, I'll generally turn to one of the shorter stories.

21:37.003 --> 21:39.205
Just, you know, if it's not a writer I know well.

21:40.307 --> 21:41.948
And just see whether I like it.

21:41.968 --> 21:42.970
To get a fast taste.

21:43.170 --> 21:44.351
Get a taste of it.

21:45.392 --> 21:47.695
And a title will catch my interest.

21:47.928 --> 21:49.751
I'll say, God, that's a really interesting title.

21:49.772 --> 21:52.056
I wonder why he called it that.

21:52.076 --> 21:53.338
I wonder why she called it that.

21:53.358 --> 21:54.641
Let me take a look at that story.

21:55.523 --> 21:59.991
And I mean, eventually I'll read, if I like the collection, I'll read it through from beginning to end.

22:00.692 --> 22:09.269
But when I'm doing my first path through a short story collection, I tend to skip around a lot and frustrate, therefore, the design of the writer.

22:09.289 --> 22:10.932
I mean, I guess it's a little like

22:11.671 --> 22:17.725
I don't do this, but people who read crime novels reading the last chapters before, you know, I can't imagine.

22:17.865 --> 22:18.808
Oh, why bother at that point?

22:18.848 --> 22:20.832
Why waste your time at that point?

22:20.993 --> 22:22.035
Exactly, exactly.

22:22.115 --> 22:27.688
But it's a little different with a short story collection because you still have to...

22:28.141 --> 22:33.131
But in putting it together, even though in this case there are 15 stories, you do want a unity.

22:33.912 --> 22:36.518
I think you do want a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

22:36.558 --> 22:41.107
You want a feeling of coherence, of an experience.

22:41.127 --> 22:46.858
And if you've done it right, you want the reader to walk away with that attitude.

22:47.446 --> 22:58.029
I think that I've questioned you about your whole life and a previous encounter, and I have that, and so I'll feel free to draw on some of that stuff for this piece.

22:58.771 --> 23:02.940
So there's really no need to put you through an hour of this.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.103
I love the collection.

23:05.243 --> 23:09.114
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to meet on this.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.139
Did you come to Boston by chance?

23:11.260 --> 23:13.867
I think maybe you were coming.

23:14.027 --> 23:19.562
I'm going to be there reading at the public library on the 23rd.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.855
Yeah, I'm going to be someplace.

23:21.895 --> 23:24.019
I'm going to be in Washington that day, as a matter of fact.

23:24.179 --> 23:27.185
So I'm sorry I won't be able to see you.

23:27.205 --> 23:30.091
I'll have this piece out by then.

23:30.352 --> 23:30.873
Oh, great.

23:31.554 --> 23:34.981
And if you'd like, give me your office address or whatever.

23:35.001 --> 23:36.284
I'll just give you my home address.

23:36.524 --> 23:36.765
Okay.

23:37.045 --> 23:38.007
214.

23:38.442 --> 23:43.608
Scott Avenue, Syracuse 13224.

23:43.849 --> 23:44.870
Okay.

23:44.890 --> 23:45.491
And do you mind?

23:45.551 --> 23:49.596
Because, you know, I've neglected to have you inscribe a book the last couple of times.

23:49.636 --> 23:55.563
If I send you a couple of books with an envelope to send it back in, would you mind doing that?

23:56.184 --> 23:56.404
Absolutely.

23:56.424 --> 23:59.067
I'd really have to have a couple of Toby Wilson.

23:59.047 --> 24:05.847
I look forward to meeting you with you again, and congratulations.

24:05.907 --> 24:07.812
Congratulations to you, Nick, on your book.

24:07.833 --> 24:08.535
That's great news.

24:08.555 --> 24:08.835
Thanks.

24:09.778 --> 24:10.581
Great talking to you.

24:10.601 --> 24:10.761
Bye-bye.
