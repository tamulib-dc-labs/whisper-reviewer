WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:04.797
and so-and-so, and I can... Okay, I can get going.

00:04.857 --> 00:08.842
Okay, what did you say about your father was one of the 12 what?

00:09.603 --> 00:10.844
The 12 years of us.

00:10.924 --> 00:11.105
Uh-huh.

00:11.565 --> 00:23.119
And then my only point, saying that was because Eugene was beautiful, my cousin was Eugene, but he was beautiful, he was a little blonde boy, and then Helen looked exactly like...

00:23.302 --> 00:29.551
The point is I can see my mother's face getting very pink when the lady was in the kind of intelligence.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.433
And who was this dear little kid?

00:31.573 --> 00:32.415
Oh, gee.

00:32.695 --> 00:34.097
I didn't look like the rest of them.

00:34.457 --> 00:37.362
And she used to say, you have to do such a wonderful job.

00:37.382 --> 00:38.503
Such a wonderful job.

00:38.523 --> 00:40.586
But now I know she meant she didn't buy.

00:40.886 --> 00:44.211
She meant that when people said things like that, I didn't get upset.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.075
But let me tell you.

00:47.375 --> 00:49.258
Oh, you have got your thing grizzling.

00:49.795 --> 01:04.740
The thing that interests me very much, and I'm going to write a little something about that, somebody made a little mistake and said that my mother, in The Living is Easy, I think that mother said something about her child in Brown, so and so on.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.864
But this girl is very talented, she should have known better.

01:06.884 --> 01:16.039
My point is, and therefore, I was going to write a little something about the Mexican mother, and of Jackson's child.

01:16.188 --> 01:19.572
they don't understand is, it is the child that is prejudiced.

01:19.892 --> 01:23.436
I used to say to my mother, I don't like Mary's mother, my mother's not very mad.

01:23.476 --> 01:24.277
What did she say to you?

01:24.897 --> 01:25.838
I said, nothing.

01:25.858 --> 01:26.739
Well, what did she do to you?

01:26.859 --> 01:27.220
Nothing.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.601
Well, why don't you like her?

01:29.082 --> 01:30.844
I don't like her face.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.867
It doesn't look like your face.

01:33.927 --> 01:45.199
My point is, if I see two mothers, one is pretty, one is plain, and the child can be plain too, but I always think that the mother

01:45.567 --> 01:47.510
is that that's a beautiful woman, it's a mother.

01:47.791 --> 01:51.557
But what I'm saying is, because there's been a little talk about the fun, the living is easy.

01:51.797 --> 01:55.563
I mean, you know how people pick up something and know that, therefore, there's something about that.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.585
That is my mother.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.929
I was disappointed at that.

02:00.692 --> 02:02.335
If I missed the quote, I must keep being funny.

02:02.655 --> 02:08.445
My mother used to say, I wouldn't marry a yower man if he was made in a court.

02:08.465 --> 02:09.887
A yower?

02:10.441 --> 02:11.945
Don't worry about this.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.769
Why don't you sit down, Ms.

02:13.790 --> 02:15.394
Weston, and we can get comfortable.

02:15.414 --> 02:20.005
All right, now, wait a minute, because I was sitting in this chair, because I'll sit there.

02:20.106 --> 02:20.527
Okay.

02:20.828 --> 02:23.775
I want you to, well, you don't have to see me, because you're not going to get pictures of me.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.202
I am going to take pictures of you, but not right away.

02:26.462 --> 02:27.083
All right.

02:27.103 --> 02:30.306
Now, Brittany, but seriously, because I was the most obedient child in the world.

02:30.326 --> 02:34.109
You can't be obedient because my grandmother made you instantly obedient.

02:34.130 --> 02:35.891
All right, I will do whatever you tell me.

02:36.011 --> 02:38.754
Well, you know, guys, because you know what you're doing, and I don't.

02:38.774 --> 02:39.695
You can think about it what I'm saying.

02:39.715 --> 02:42.878
Well, I think you should just sit down and make yourself... Wait, can I sit down here?

02:42.898 --> 02:46.681
No, no, right there, where you're comfortable, I think, is probably what we'd like to do.

02:46.701 --> 02:47.001
All right.

02:47.322 --> 02:51.546
And then we're just going to talk, and I don't even want you to think that that thing is there.

02:51.566 --> 02:52.186
It's just there.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.087
That's my problem.

02:53.877 --> 02:54.838
I don't think about it.

02:55.579 --> 02:57.322
And then the man goes, like, oh, my God.

02:58.723 --> 03:00.506
Oh, my God, there's nothing to do with it.

03:00.526 --> 03:02.368
Don't worry about this.

03:02.408 --> 03:08.296
We have about 20 newspapers that we're working for that are very interested in this particular story.

03:09.377 --> 03:14.905
We even brought two copies of your book to inscribe for us before we go.

03:15.025 --> 03:20.492
And I'm looking for a first edition of your first book, and I'll find it.

03:20.978 --> 03:25.565
And when we come down sometime this summer, maybe we can come by and say hello.

03:25.765 --> 03:27.928
But please, of course.

03:27.948 --> 03:31.994
My wife's father lives here in Oak Bluffs, just a little bit from here.

03:32.595 --> 03:34.437
He's a valentess.

03:35.138 --> 03:35.639
Valentess.

03:35.659 --> 03:37.782
Valentess, all right, all right.

03:37.862 --> 03:38.543
He's a new cover.

03:38.643 --> 03:41.527
I'm going to hold my notebook, and Claudia's going to hold the books.

03:41.908 --> 03:42.289
All right.

03:42.429 --> 03:45.153
I'll let you get some clips for that.

03:45.173 --> 03:45.413
Okay.

03:46.034 --> 03:50.260
I heard you answering some of the things that I had in mind, but

03:50.898 --> 03:54.343
How much of this book would you say is autobiographical?

03:54.744 --> 03:56.927
Are there autobiographical elements in this novel?

03:57.908 --> 03:58.730
Well, I don't know.

03:58.950 --> 04:04.698
What I mean by that is, there would never have been that book if there had not been a little book.

04:04.718 --> 04:06.161
You've read the book.

04:06.181 --> 04:17.277
If there had not been this little boy, who, there was a situation, the woman, you know, very much like the situation, and it was a Sunday, all of the castellas were closed,

04:18.370 --> 04:24.696
And we wanted to get this woman off the island, you know, the fight woman off the island, so and so on.

04:25.196 --> 04:34.725
And therefore, oh, my poor child, no, of course, because I was trying to make situations be funny, but then he called, and then this happened, and so on.

04:34.745 --> 04:39.170
Oh, but anyway, my point is, oh, you know, Luke.

04:39.190 --> 04:39.610
All right.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.353
There was, everybody was so interested in Luke.

04:42.413 --> 04:46.957
And one day I said to a friend of mine, tell me about him, oh, daddy, she said, not you.

04:47.317 --> 04:48.158
I said, not me what?

04:48.458 --> 04:50.642
She said, because are you crazy about him, too?

04:51.003 --> 04:53.968
I think I only see him as a character.

04:54.208 --> 04:59.879
But anyway, my point is that we were trying to get this girl, a white girl, off the island.

05:01.362 --> 05:10.939
She went back to me, and she and I liked each other, because she was sophisticated, and I was sophisticated, and a friend of mine, the same man that I told you about, he was the one that had introduced her to Luke.

05:11.577 --> 05:15.642
When I say Luke, the man's name was Luke.

05:16.023 --> 05:17.204
I'm talking about the character now.

05:17.545 --> 05:19.607
Yeah, but I'm talking about the real person.

05:20.168 --> 05:22.691
We were trying to get the real person off the island.

05:27.497 --> 05:27.998
The man.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.362
No, no, no, don't forget.

05:31.723 --> 05:32.704
You've read the book.

05:32.724 --> 05:33.225
All right.

05:33.806 --> 05:35.648
Don't forget, what's his name?

05:36.549 --> 05:37.550
The white woman.

05:38.792 --> 05:39.593
He came down.

05:40.889 --> 05:43.633
Remember, Lute wanted to marry this girl.

05:43.713 --> 05:48.320
That's right.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.203
That's right.

05:50.363 --> 05:52.185
That's right.

05:54.048 --> 06:04.603
She knows the book very well, doesn't she?

06:04.623 --> 06:07.808
I'm very happy about that because I said, do you know the history of the book?

06:08.648 --> 06:28.194
Oh, the only thing, the point is, that's all over now, my point is, I used to say, it happened yet, my point is, Mary Roberts Reinhopper, the writer, he knew her name, well, oh, all right, she used to give, I call her a grant, I don't know, a thousand dollars, and she gave out, she gave three.

06:28.214 --> 06:34.082
Two young men, I think they were white young men, got, that had the grant, and I got one, well, yeah,

06:34.248 --> 06:40.897
But you probably weren't even born when there were a group of black people, black men.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.539
Did you know those?

06:42.659 --> 06:45.403
Oh, you didn't know both of those men either.

06:45.443 --> 06:46.744
What did they call themselves?

06:46.764 --> 06:54.875
Everybody who was a doctor or a lawyer or a black, any doctor with a whole handkerchief head or something.

06:55.095 --> 06:56.597
They had negative things to say about them.

06:57.038 --> 06:58.720
And the person all of a sudden asked,

06:59.020 --> 07:10.811
This book has had a history, and all of a sudden I said to myself, if I bring this book out now, finish this book now, they will cover it, and the white reviewers will not know how to review it.

07:10.831 --> 07:15.122
So I had to put the book aside, you see.

07:15.490 --> 07:19.294
And then, of course, the situation got better.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.495
And then I started the novel.

07:20.515 --> 07:21.597
Then there were other things.

07:21.617 --> 07:24.099
I can't go into all the things about that novel.

07:24.119 --> 07:34.470
But finally, as you know, as you know, not only it got finished, you see, and it was well, it had been, I think, well received.

07:35.171 --> 07:36.453
And I'm very happy about that.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.236
Because there were times when I really disappeared.

07:39.256 --> 07:40.957
Will this heaven novel get through?

07:41.178 --> 07:43.320
Oh, you see, that's right on top of me.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.953
And then the house went up over there.

07:46.453 --> 07:52.340
All three of those, some coincidence, all three of those houses were being built.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.142
And bang, bang, bang.

07:54.162 --> 07:56.324
Now, I said, you don't need much sleep.

07:56.344 --> 07:58.567
And I said, well, they will go at 5 o'clock.

07:58.587 --> 07:59.528
But I'm older.

08:00.268 --> 08:02.631
And all of a sudden, I realized I was tired.

08:02.711 --> 08:07.056
I used to, with me as a lot of family, so they only needed about four hours sleep.

08:07.076 --> 08:09.038
And therefore, when everybody was asleep,

08:09.170 --> 08:14.035
Then I wrote until dawn, or something like that, but then I didn't realize, because I come in several times.

08:14.055 --> 08:15.957
Now, when are we talking about this?

08:15.977 --> 08:20.161
Well, my point of talking about this, this poor novel that I finished.

08:20.921 --> 08:21.622
This novel here?

08:21.642 --> 08:23.003
This novel here, yes.

08:23.324 --> 08:30.831
But I went through so much to finish that novel, because I couldn't work on it in the daytime, because three houses were big.

08:30.851 --> 08:33.774
You know that big thing that they have, the crane?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.017
This is a similar.

08:37.688 --> 08:40.673
Did you just finish this last summer, this book?

08:40.693 --> 08:42.395
No, I finished it about, Daryl.

08:44.038 --> 08:45.860
It was longer ago then, Daryl.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.586
Well, no, it did, but it was Daryl years ago.

08:50.387 --> 08:51.248
You didn't know that.

08:51.829 --> 08:52.911
I didn't know that.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.516
I hadn't thought about that.

08:56.997 --> 09:01.364
That's why I talked to you about the grant, or whatever you called it.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.549
I got one, too, and that was just my pitiful little story.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.852
I imagine that they'd gone on to

09:07.051 --> 09:13.377
fame and glory, but I was afraid to, and I think I was right, because they were very negative men.

09:13.557 --> 09:18.943
When I say they were afraid of it, the reviewers, I think, was, well, that was my point.

09:19.163 --> 09:25.169
I knew I was afraid that they would be afraid to review it, and those black men would review it.

09:25.229 --> 09:26.550
I don't know what was wrong with it.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.933
Are you talking about what time now, the 70s or so?

09:29.013 --> 09:29.854
No, wait a minute.

09:31.495 --> 09:31.876
Let me see.

09:31.896 --> 09:34.358
I started, I think it was the 40s.

09:35.013 --> 09:37.676
Because your first book was published in 1948.

09:37.776 --> 09:38.657
Oh, wait a minute.

09:38.677 --> 09:38.877
All right.

09:39.218 --> 09:45.285
Then in that case... Well, then in that case... And so, it's so interesting.

09:45.665 --> 09:48.608
People always ask you, why didn't you write another book?

09:48.728 --> 09:51.291
I didn't start another book, but Doubleday didn't want it.

09:51.572 --> 09:53.494
I mean, there happened to so many writers.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.657
But you never wrote another book!

09:56.677 --> 10:00.582
But they weren't sure another book.

10:00.602 --> 10:03.785
Well, no, ask me the questions that you asked.

10:03.965 --> 10:04.446
Okay.

10:04.595 --> 10:07.963
I'll ask you another question.

10:08.966 --> 10:14.740
I guess I want to know when you knew that you were going to be a writer.

10:14.973 --> 10:17.056
Oh, well, you don't know this.

10:17.256 --> 10:19.139
I know a little bit about it, yeah.

10:19.159 --> 10:20.000
About the short stories.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.702
I know that you said you won a prize.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.924
Well, I was going to tell him that.

10:22.984 --> 10:26.068
You won a prize when you were 18 years old, but I read someplace.

10:26.088 --> 10:26.929
Well, that was before I met.

10:27.009 --> 10:30.835
You actually knew that at the age of seven that you wanted to be a writer, I guess.

10:30.855 --> 10:35.301
Yeah, well, my point is you will, definitely, naturally, he's doing the book.

10:35.321 --> 10:36.783
I mean, at the wedding.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.346
But then they, I don't know when they're coming up.

10:39.366 --> 10:41.329
They're coming up with my short stories.

10:41.369 --> 10:43.512
There was an introduction to the short stories.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.503
It really is a lovely introduction.

10:49.330 --> 10:50.451
Well, wait a minute.

10:51.152 --> 10:52.873
I'm really upset in introduction.

10:53.313 --> 10:57.417
I was the one who wrote about the stories.

10:57.437 --> 11:00.639
I began writing them when I was about four or five years ago.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.142
This is another nice piece.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.123
And then, of course, they're bringing up the stories.

11:05.484 --> 11:12.570
Understandably, often, there are a lot of people who want me to do the short stories.

11:13.010 --> 11:19.135
But the Doubleday, understandably, I dare say, think that the book

11:19.570 --> 11:20.912
will sell the short stories.

11:20.932 --> 11:21.672
Do you follow what I'm doing?

11:21.692 --> 11:22.794
Yes, I agree with that.

11:22.814 --> 11:36.549
Oh, oh, and that's why, you see, because the scholars sort of want the short stories, and I must confess, I love my short stories, and why do you think it's because they're short?

11:36.569 --> 11:41.515
Well, my daughter, from one of the years old, is she was a photographer at a school time school, and you'd see that you'd do a new question.

11:41.595 --> 11:41.715
Yes.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.219
And she said, I made her short stories in one of the great books in the school.

11:45.239 --> 11:45.759
Oh, right.

11:45.779 --> 11:47.041
That makes me very happy.

11:47.341 --> 11:49.003
You would be surprised at how many, um,

11:49.760 --> 11:57.770
This is our 12-year-old daughter who said this.

11:57.790 --> 11:58.812
Ah, no.

11:58.832 --> 12:00.494
And she reads your stories.

12:00.754 --> 12:05.280
Oh, right, because I don't have to say that because I love my short stories.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.264
I don't know what, because it doesn't take as long to write a short story.

12:08.785 --> 12:12.950
Well, what's amazing is you cover five generations in this one book.

12:12.990 --> 12:16.875
I don't know how you can do so much in 240 pages as you've done in this book.

12:16.895 --> 12:19.699
Well, in the beginning, when I got the book, that book,

12:20.017 --> 12:21.999
Because they must have lifted out a lot.

12:22.299 --> 12:23.500
But I don't think so.

12:23.861 --> 12:30.367
Well, the reason I don't think so, I'm ashamed to tell you, I can't read anything about it.

12:30.427 --> 12:34.511
Because you worked so hard and hit it?

12:34.811 --> 12:34.911
Yes.

12:34.931 --> 12:38.254
A young girl would help me, and I would just type-form and so-and-so, and I would do one.

12:38.595 --> 12:43.079
I used to do, I'm not being funny, I used to do seven drops.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.060
Seven drops.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.201
Do you write long-hand?

12:45.221 --> 12:45.922
Do you type-hand?

12:45.962 --> 12:47.904
Oh, I can't use a typewriter.

12:47.924 --> 12:48.184
No.

12:48.485 --> 12:49.426
I can't have to do with it.

12:49.446 --> 12:51.868
How do you write your stories for the Vineyard Gazette?

12:51.888 --> 12:52.609
Well, they're different.

12:53.069 --> 12:54.390
But I don't write stories for them.

12:54.550 --> 12:55.471
But you write a column.

12:55.892 --> 12:57.413
Well, that's when I was at work there.

12:57.513 --> 12:58.654
I don't work there anymore.

12:58.674 --> 13:01.556
When I was at work there, of course, I used the text writer.

13:01.837 --> 13:03.098
But that's a different situation.

13:03.118 --> 13:04.899
But my point is, I don't know.

13:05.180 --> 13:09.563
When I use the text writer, it doesn't seem real to me when I'm writing about them.

13:09.584 --> 13:10.644
People don't seem real.

13:11.065 --> 13:11.866
Do you understand?

13:12.326 --> 13:14.107
It doesn't seem real.

13:14.148 --> 13:16.990
Well, don't forget that a year ago was when I started writing.

13:17.442 --> 13:20.266
And you have a pen, a pencil, and pen and pencil.

13:20.286 --> 13:25.594
And I think that's it, you see, because... Now, I can type when I was working at the kids, and I did type.

13:25.614 --> 13:28.558
When I was writing about people, or the real people, all right.

13:29.039 --> 13:32.784
And because of the strangest feeling I've ever had, I'll never forget.

13:33.004 --> 13:35.929
I wish I could remember what chapter I was writing about.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.973
This never happened to me before, and I think it will never happen again.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.715
All of a sudden, I was in the book.

13:41.276 --> 13:45.042
I think after you've read the book, it may have been when the little girl got lost.

13:45.983 --> 13:47.365
I don't know...

13:47.935 --> 13:51.840
Because I've never been scared of my life.

13:51.860 --> 13:52.701
Really?

13:52.721 --> 13:52.941
Yeah.

13:52.961 --> 13:56.725
Yeah, and I remember that, you know, be calm, be calm, be calm.

13:57.046 --> 14:00.970
And I put on my coat and hat and so forth, and I went to walk.

14:02.112 --> 14:06.296
And I kept praying that nobody would say anything to me.

14:06.537 --> 14:07.658
I was in that world.

14:07.678 --> 14:09.040
I was in another world.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.123
And then by the time I got down to it, nobody spoke to me.

14:12.203 --> 14:13.605
I mean, because of the sort of death.

14:13.822 --> 14:15.204
And then I snapped out of it.

14:15.384 --> 14:17.287
But I've never had such a frightening experience.

14:17.307 --> 14:18.228
It had never happened before.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.993
I've written many things and never had that feeling.

14:21.253 --> 14:22.395
But I was an Italian.

14:22.475 --> 14:24.598
And I always wished that I could remember.

14:24.858 --> 14:27.202
But I think it had something to do with the little girl.

14:27.222 --> 14:28.123
I can't remember.

14:28.143 --> 14:30.927
Oh, is that so?

14:32.449 --> 14:35.674
Well, there was a little girl who got lost.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.379
Was there on the island?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.141
Yeah.

14:40.161 --> 14:41.803
She went wandering, whatever.

14:42.087 --> 14:48.075
Well, I always, you know, I always say to you, if there weren't any real people, I don't know how I would write.

14:48.456 --> 14:52.261
But you see, because I am a writer, I have a writer's memory.

14:52.662 --> 14:54.685
Because if I had asked them, do you remember?

14:55.085 --> 14:55.646
I don't remember.

14:55.666 --> 14:57.248
I mean, that happens so often.

14:57.328 --> 14:59.952
I said, do you remember that day, so forth and so on, and they don't remember.

15:00.272 --> 15:01.574
But I saw things.

15:01.594 --> 15:03.757
As a writer, I do think that I'm a writer.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.159
I saw things.

15:05.239 --> 15:05.980
I saw things.

15:06.241 --> 15:07.522
Because I remember me.

15:08.484 --> 15:09.926
We were all good at it.

15:09.946 --> 15:11.588
That little girl was blonde.

15:12.884 --> 15:14.707
But this little girl was actually very fair.

15:15.008 --> 15:16.791
Well, I think that's what the thing happened.

15:16.851 --> 15:18.534
Her mother was brown-skinned.

15:18.554 --> 15:25.225
And the mother said to them, because she was brown-skinned, the mother said to them that she was very light.

15:25.245 --> 15:26.427
But the child was very fair.

15:26.447 --> 15:27.208
She looked very bright.

15:27.228 --> 15:30.213
And I think that they said that the child, I think that's what happened.

15:30.233 --> 15:33.419
By the time they got to this person and that person, it was a colored child.

15:33.719 --> 15:36.484
So that little girl was like this.

15:36.504 --> 15:38.267
She was a, yeah.

15:38.568 --> 15:42.253
How many years did you spend writing this book, would you say?

15:42.273 --> 15:43.555
Well, not exactly years.

15:44.696 --> 15:54.390
I wrote, oh, I think that, when I sent that off, you know, I think, I think you did 500, no, not 500, 50 pages.

15:55.131 --> 15:57.654
That's like a proposal, so to speak.

15:57.714 --> 16:00.138
You mean you said 50 pages of this book off?

16:00.158 --> 16:06.887
Yeah, because, yes, but maybe you don't know that, because a darling woman, I knew, she wanted to

16:07.002 --> 16:18.538
quite right, she wanted to, she was writing a novel, and I said, don't send, you can see, maybe we'll figure that out in a minute, I said, don't send them, only send them 50 pages.

16:19.539 --> 16:24.006
But you see, if you send them the whole book, they think, do you understand what I'm saying?

16:24.026 --> 16:24.326
Yes, I do.

16:24.486 --> 16:29.894
All right, and so, all right, all right, so that, therefore, I think in the conventional.

16:30.294 --> 16:34.360
But I mean, in terms of how long did it take you to write it, though, actually writing the book?

16:34.897 --> 16:36.459
The first fifty pages.

16:36.519 --> 16:37.560
No, the whole book.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.901
The whole book.

16:38.921 --> 16:39.502
Oh, well, you think.

16:39.522 --> 16:41.304
You should write it, I guess.

16:42.124 --> 16:46.089
Well, you think it was done in part, the first fifty pages.

16:46.949 --> 16:52.375
And then I wrote, let me see, when did I do that to Mrs. Onathus?

16:52.395 --> 16:55.398
And that's a question I have for you as well.

16:56.199 --> 16:59.602
Your collaboration with Mrs. Onathus, you mentioned her in the book.

17:00.043 --> 17:02.085
Was she your editor on this book for a while?

17:02.318 --> 17:05.923
Yeah, well, that's a, that's a compliment.

17:06.444 --> 17:06.765
Yes.

17:06.805 --> 17:07.145
Oh, yes.

17:07.706 --> 17:10.230
She was the one who, who, oh, God.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.392
Everything is so complicated.

17:12.053 --> 17:14.216
Let's just talk about Mrs. O' Master's thing.

17:14.236 --> 17:15.378
Let's just talk about.

17:15.398 --> 17:15.879
Oh, right.

17:15.919 --> 17:18.843
She was, she had a house on the island, as you know that.

17:18.863 --> 17:27.156
And so my point is, I knew of Mrs. O' Master's, but the last thing I would have done would be to ask her, to tell her, ask her, all right.

17:27.516 --> 17:29.980
So a person that I knew, oh, really God, is so hot.

17:30.601 --> 17:46.359
What happened, I guess, is what you—and the tape is not on—but what happened is that Mrs. Onas, and somebody went to Mrs. Onas.

17:46.379 --> 17:47.640
And told her about the book.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.361
About the book.

17:48.561 --> 17:50.503
And she must have—she got in touch with you.

17:50.803 --> 17:51.384
Yeah.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.086
Well, yes, because I didn't know anything about it.

17:53.587 --> 17:55.088
That's a great story.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.710
That's a nice story.

17:57.061 --> 17:58.403
Well, it's interesting.

17:58.663 --> 18:06.273
The reason I'm saying that it's interesting about the devil bag, many things happen, and I mean, my point being, I'm the one who has to keep my mouth shut.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.255
Do you follow what I'm saying?

18:08.036 --> 18:10.539
Do you want to be willing to tell that on me?

18:10.679 --> 18:13.744
Well, I'm sure that I always think that... Yes.

18:13.764 --> 18:17.288
I'm sure that I'm not the only writer that I have gone through.

18:17.348 --> 18:20.152
I always say, a lowly writer.

18:20.172 --> 18:22.355
Because anybody can take a pen and a pen.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.418
Well, how many people do you know if I have the time?

18:24.702 --> 18:28.107
Did you come and visit?

18:28.127 --> 18:29.810
Oh yes, that's cute.

18:30.451 --> 18:31.753
Because you read the book.

18:32.354 --> 18:33.976
And you read about the Oval.

18:34.337 --> 18:35.498
You know the Oval.

18:35.538 --> 18:36.520
Now where is the Oval?

18:36.540 --> 18:37.562
There is no Oval.

18:37.702 --> 18:38.803
That's my point.

18:39.004 --> 18:39.865
It's my point.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.528
That's my point.

18:41.928 --> 18:43.410
We were wondering, where is the Oval?

18:43.611 --> 18:44.332
All right.

18:44.452 --> 18:48.398
One day I have to ask you to use the title of that.

18:48.580 --> 18:53.665
So I went outside and I looked around, and then I said, oh, that's an oval.

18:54.265 --> 18:58.549
But I didn't mean to use my own, but I said to myself, that's an oval.

18:58.889 --> 19:02.032
I don't know, I'll use that word, you see.

19:02.713 --> 19:09.219
And therefore, Mrs. Onassis came, the first day she came to me, she asked people all around.

19:09.239 --> 19:16.225
She knew how to get around in the area, but she asked people where the oval was, and nobody knew where the oval was.

19:16.643 --> 19:17.244
Nobody knew.

19:17.484 --> 19:23.233
And then maybe he probably said something about where the Darcy West lived, and then somebody said that back then.

19:23.253 --> 19:25.316
She came to visit you here?

19:25.476 --> 19:28.321
Well, no, well, you can call it a visit, but we worked together.

19:28.701 --> 19:35.912
You see, I would do a chapter for her, send it to her, and then she would come back the following week, Monday.

19:35.932 --> 19:36.473
She would come on Monday.

19:36.513 --> 19:37.955
She would come here to your house?

19:38.256 --> 19:39.057
She would come here, too.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.980
Yeah, that's why she would come to my house.

19:41.382 --> 19:46.688
You might tell me about it, but I did a beautiful piece up out there, and I brought up the Gazette.

19:47.248 --> 19:50.592
I did that piece, but the Gazette was quite a long piece.

19:50.752 --> 19:52.454
Did you read the little thing that I brought up?

19:52.554 --> 19:54.236
No, but you did read a little thing.

19:54.356 --> 19:57.179
Isn't that in that book something about Mr. O'Neill?

19:57.199 --> 19:57.599
Yes, there is.

19:57.619 --> 19:59.702
In the beginning, you'd thank her for working.

19:59.722 --> 20:04.006
All right, but it was a long piece that— I'll find out probably.

20:04.587 --> 20:07.390
Yeah, because—oh, the Gazette will give it to you.

20:07.555 --> 20:10.539
Yeah, because it was a beautiful thing that I did.

20:10.799 --> 20:15.204
Because we were, I think you, they powered something, but the mismatch pair, you see.

20:15.765 --> 20:17.186
Who should I talk to over there?

20:17.206 --> 20:19.709
Any person in particular that you deal with?

20:19.729 --> 20:20.210
Dick Weston.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.572
Dick Weston, I'll call him.

20:21.672 --> 20:23.013
Do you know who Weston is?

20:23.033 --> 20:23.334
Yes, I do.

20:23.354 --> 20:24.135
Oh, you know his father?

20:24.235 --> 20:24.936
I know his father.

20:24.956 --> 20:30.302
Oh, because they said of his father that no president did anything until he read them.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.145
His father's father.

20:33.326 --> 20:35.088
That happens to be true, probably, yeah.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.090
Very likely, very likely, yeah.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.333
So let's talk a little bit about your childhood.

20:39.393 --> 20:47.263
I read someplace how you said to your mother, I want to go into my room and close the door because, and then she said, but tell me, could you tell me that little story?

20:47.784 --> 20:50.707
Yeah, because I think it's going to be with the show stories.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.650
I think they've got in there with the show stories.

20:52.670 --> 20:56.355
I mean, your own experience about how you decided to go into it.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.277
I'm sure.

20:58.758 --> 21:06.047
My point in saying that is, very often when I go to a lecture or something, I'm sure I've lost faith in some of those.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.885
And I always tell that little story about my mother.

21:10.365 --> 21:20.620
My point is, my family used to laugh at me, and they would say, that's no child, that's a little sawed-off woman.

21:22.944 --> 21:33.139
And so I found that useful, the same thing, because when I come home, I look so small, and then I tell, yeah, well, I think I was about five years old.

21:33.399 --> 21:35.983
Well, you've read it, haven't you, that I wrote.

21:36.537 --> 21:37.398
Because that's true.

21:37.418 --> 21:39.141
I asked my mother if I could be with it.

21:39.742 --> 21:42.425
Nowadays, children have got accepted to see.

21:42.445 --> 21:44.348
But they just say, please, and it just amazes me.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.211
And then somebody will come.

21:46.391 --> 21:47.553
You're talking.

21:47.573 --> 21:48.354
You have a child.

21:48.654 --> 21:49.736
And the child goes upstairs.

21:50.277 --> 21:52.300
I mean, oh, that's the way my mother goes.

21:52.620 --> 21:53.822
He had to take a step back.

21:53.842 --> 21:55.664
He had to take a step back.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.849
No child opens his mouth.

22:01.252 --> 22:02.734
All you do, you just sit quietly.

22:02.754 --> 22:05.278
If the lady offers you something, say no thank you.

22:05.613 --> 22:09.537
And the reason I say that, in those days, people didn't have enough.

22:09.557 --> 22:20.728
And one day, there was a woman there, a white, a colored woman who looked like white, and we children would pass her out of our way to school, and she would offer us something, and we would say, no, thank you.

22:21.028 --> 22:24.932
And one day, she came to visit my mother, and she said to her, what are your children like?

22:25.012 --> 22:31.198
Because I asked them, and then my mother explained, and you see, my point is, in those days,

22:31.516 --> 22:46.494
If you took something, because I know I went to visit a family once years ago when I was a young girl, about 18 years old, and everybody got up one at a time and went into the kitchen to eat, because there wasn't enough to offer anybody.

22:46.834 --> 22:54.283
That's why I get that problem with the young common people in particular, because they don't know what it was like

22:54.584 --> 22:58.409
many, many, many, many years ago, you see.

22:58.429 --> 23:02.735
But you told your mother at the age of 11 that you wanted to be a writer, I guess.

23:02.755 --> 23:05.338
You wanted to lock the door to your room so you could write.

23:05.799 --> 23:07.782
I don't think I was 11.

23:07.842 --> 23:09.023
I was 19 years old.

23:09.143 --> 23:10.465
And that was true.

23:11.046 --> 23:13.890
I have to say this about my mother.

23:13.910 --> 23:16.173
She was a good mother in that respect, you see.

23:16.513 --> 23:18.236
I mean, she didn't, she let me do it.

23:18.716 --> 23:20.399
She let me, she let me do it.

23:20.419 --> 23:23.022
I think that it had a lot to do with her.

23:24.250 --> 23:30.558
Did she ask you what things you wanted to write about, or did you know what you wanted to write about?

23:30.578 --> 23:31.959
But, you know, this is kind of interesting.

23:31.979 --> 23:33.702
I've thought about this fairly recently.

23:33.722 --> 23:35.404
I'm the brown one.

23:35.424 --> 23:41.591
And Eugenia and Helen were... You'd be surprised how easy it is for colored people to buy.

23:42.512 --> 23:42.773
But why?

23:44.274 --> 23:44.455
No.

23:44.575 --> 23:47.118
You're an only child.

23:47.278 --> 23:48.700
I'm an only child.

23:48.760 --> 23:53.025
And that was one of the reasons, I think, that I wasn't an only child, because my mother wanted to bring her

23:53.309 --> 23:59.780
I mean, she couldn't, you know what I mean.

23:59.820 --> 24:10.980
Well, my point is, if she'd had another child, my father, and I'm just sort of thinking that this is what happened, if my father would have said, well, Dorothy has got a sister or brother's place.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.142
Do you understand what I'm saying?

24:12.182 --> 24:12.403
Yes.

24:12.803 --> 24:16.109
Because that is the way it was done in those days.

24:16.129 --> 24:17.832
Now you don't give a dime about anybody.

24:18.318 --> 24:21.102
But in those days, you do, you see.

24:21.182 --> 24:23.285
Because my mother was going to be a singer.

24:24.326 --> 24:25.588
Did I tell you?

24:25.608 --> 24:26.469
Well, no.

24:26.509 --> 24:28.712
Your mother was one of 19 children, I read.

24:28.772 --> 24:30.194
My grandmother told her.

24:30.234 --> 24:34.160
And the point is, she was always ashamed about this.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.623
She never even told me.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.725
I just overheard them say it.

24:38.005 --> 24:40.608
But the point is, you're not a sexy family.

24:40.869 --> 24:42.591
And I think that's true.

24:42.611 --> 24:46.857
I think the point is, if you have 19 children, you can't have much sex.

24:47.073 --> 24:49.717
Do you understand what I'm saying?

24:49.818 --> 24:51.841
Yeah, I thought about that, because they were single births.

24:52.462 --> 24:55.988
And I think that, and I think that, because they were ashamed that they had this.

24:56.008 --> 25:10.212
But I had to come back to my poor grandma and only went to bed with my grandfather, and that was something funny about 19 times, because she always had a crib baby, a left baby, and a toddler.

25:11.238 --> 25:14.443
You see, and so that happens often.

25:14.783 --> 25:18.909
I mean, I can understand my mother's embarrassment, and the sisters used to argue.

25:19.530 --> 25:28.463
But Mama only had 18, Mama only had 18 children, and somebody said, Mama had 19, what's the difference between 18 years and 19 years?

25:28.483 --> 25:29.765
Yeah.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.811
What were some of the first things that you wrote, I guess, as a child?

25:34.572 --> 25:35.794
Actually, the first thing I wrote,

25:36.314 --> 25:44.666
Because, about a Chinese girl, because, or a Japanese guy, I thought you were supposed to write about things you didn't know about, do you know what I mean?

25:45.467 --> 26:06.017
And I never will forget that, because, you know, and then, and then, not then, but when I got to be a little older, I wrote a story about myself and my two cousins, I didn't recall them around, and I wrote about the mother, my mother, about 40 years old, and I sent it, that was always, I don't know, I sent it to some publisher,

26:06.132 --> 26:10.477
And I never forgot about 18 or 19, and I couldn't understand what he meant.

26:10.517 --> 26:19.388
Well, he said that if I wanted to write about the mother, well, I don't remember what it was, that he would be glad to see the steward.

26:19.408 --> 26:22.592
I couldn't understand why he wanted to write about somebody 40 years old.

26:23.413 --> 26:26.477
Because the woman 40 years old knows more than an 18-year-old.

26:26.837 --> 26:29.421
And I guess my mother was a colorful person.

26:29.441 --> 26:32.224
I didn't realize that, but she was a colorful person.

26:33.318 --> 26:35.680
Well, yes.

26:35.961 --> 26:42.808
Essentially, they're questions that you never ask, even if they're all nothing you don't ask.

26:42.828 --> 26:45.591
My point is, she was taken, she hated Sopranos.

26:45.891 --> 26:48.594
And I said, she was a mental soprano.

26:49.095 --> 26:54.340
And so she was just, oh, Jen, they're speaking up.

26:54.621 --> 27:01.688
But the thing was, and this is a little sentimental, the thing was, I told you she had all these brothers and sisters.

27:02.562 --> 27:09.610
And what he was doing was, she was going to be a singer, and as I told you, I never asked him if she was going to pass or whatever.

27:09.931 --> 27:27.912
But anyway, my point is that my grandmother died, leaving no any, well, from two, wait a minute, leaving, the youngest was about two years old, and then the next, and then they were up to 14, and then they were 15, 17, so and so on.

27:28.094 --> 27:35.781
So that, therefore, my father had asked, well, I'm saying this because, as I always say, I wrote The Living Is Easy.

27:36.402 --> 27:38.043
I made much of it up.

27:38.303 --> 27:38.904
Do you understand?

27:39.164 --> 27:45.070
And the children chose to think that that was my mother, and that was my, you understand what I'm saying here?

27:45.090 --> 27:47.392
And so it's like, it's altogether different.

27:47.512 --> 27:52.777
And so my mother asked my father if he was great, but he'd been asking him for a thousand times.

27:53.117 --> 27:57.561
And he told me that she wanted to be a singer because it helped her mother with the children.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.867
And on this day, she heard that her mother died.

28:01.187 --> 28:04.070
And she went to my father and asked him to lend her $30.

28:05.071 --> 28:06.093
And he gave her $300.

28:06.333 --> 28:07.474
Oh, I get a little choked.

28:07.494 --> 28:08.576
And he gave her $300.

28:09.457 --> 28:17.686
And then, well, my grandmother looked like my father, and my grandfather looked like so-and-so.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.250
And a lot of people, as you know, that's not the people who they think they are.

28:21.571 --> 28:22.772
And so my father knew.

28:23.562 --> 28:32.991
that my mother, and all of these children, that my mother could buy nice clothes for them, you know, maybe buy some plates and so forth and so on.

28:33.371 --> 28:38.356
And so many people said, my mother married my father's money.

28:38.776 --> 28:44.462
No, she married him because she could not repay this good man, and he'd been up here.

28:44.482 --> 28:46.303
She wasn't having a thing, you see.

28:46.524 --> 28:49.086
And I think that's why, what was that so funny?

28:49.106 --> 28:51.088
I think that's why I'm an only child.

28:51.457 --> 29:00.711
because he would understandably... Now, you were brought up in Boston, Mary, and your father did... I understand that your father was actually brought into slavery.

29:01.111 --> 29:13.009
Oh, yeah, he was... And that he became very prosperous... Well, that's one of the reasons I wanted to write this book, you see, because he was a slave.

29:13.445 --> 29:16.568
I don't know how much you know about that.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.609
He was a slave.

29:17.629 --> 29:18.790
He was freed when he was seven.

29:19.071 --> 29:21.573
Now, I have to say that my father had blue eyes.

29:22.254 --> 29:27.459
And therefore, he had to have a little white ancestry.

29:27.859 --> 29:30.602
And my point in saying that is that this happens very often.

29:31.343 --> 29:40.532
I don't know that his father, his real father, well, that the man who was his father, oh, I think my father, I think he lives.

29:40.698 --> 29:43.342
how to read later.

29:43.663 --> 29:49.632
But the point is that often these masters are rather helpful to other children.

29:49.692 --> 29:55.401
Well, my point in saying helpful, my grandmother was a cook.

29:55.421 --> 29:56.783
Where was this now?

29:57.184 --> 29:58.486
Richmond, Virginia.

29:59.086 --> 30:02.592
Your father was born in slavery in Virginia as well?

30:02.612 --> 30:03.313
That's right.

30:03.563 --> 30:08.227
And he was freed when he was, when he came, I think, when he was seven.

30:08.267 --> 30:10.269
I've seen that, seven years old.

30:10.289 --> 30:11.090
All right, all right.

30:11.350 --> 30:22.200
And then because, and that's why I'm trying to explain that, because his mother had been a cook, she went to work in a, she went to work in a boarding house.

30:22.981 --> 30:26.143
And then it was my father, no, and my father was my little boy again.

30:26.444 --> 30:27.705
They had two little brothers.

30:27.725 --> 30:30.607
And my father went to the open, you know what the open market is?

30:30.988 --> 30:32.389
It's open market, you see.

30:32.588 --> 30:37.034
and took to buy for her, for her to cook.

30:37.054 --> 30:40.158
And so he got interested in buying and selling.

30:40.518 --> 30:47.787
And when he was, I think he was 10 years old, when he said to his mother, let's go into our own business.

30:48.488 --> 30:50.210
Was he still in Virginia?

30:50.250 --> 30:53.434
How old was he when he came to Boston?

30:53.454 --> 30:56.779
I dare say, maybe 30 years old.

30:56.799 --> 31:01.144
And it's so interesting, my mother and father were born to get married.

31:01.394 --> 31:07.624
to each other, I think, because my mother came north with—I told you, she came north with a teacher.

31:07.824 --> 31:08.766
And in Springfield.

31:09.187 --> 31:18.061
And my point is, my father was in Springfield, Mass, and he had the—they were new, not then—electric powers.

31:18.081 --> 31:20.845
And you see, with seats and so forth and so forth.

31:21.066 --> 31:25.613
And even white people could not go in as after money, because you dress up and so on and so on.

31:25.677 --> 31:27.359
And my point is, it's so interesting.

31:27.379 --> 31:31.945
The reason I'm telling you that, if he saw this little 14-year-old girl, he thought she was white.

31:32.165 --> 31:33.027
He didn't think about it.

31:33.587 --> 31:38.994
But he was aware of him because my father had brought a retired-race horse.

31:39.014 --> 31:41.237
And my mother loved my horses.

31:41.257 --> 31:42.339
And he would stand there.

31:42.599 --> 31:44.862
It's so interesting because he would stand there.

31:44.882 --> 31:45.483
He didn't know.

31:45.503 --> 31:48.086
He didn't know anything.

31:48.106 --> 31:50.149
He thought she was a little white child or something.

31:51.192 --> 31:55.077
And so she used to look and envy this man in this house because she loved to.

31:55.117 --> 32:00.404
She used to say to him, your father would go around the corner like a wild man and so forth.

32:00.644 --> 32:03.408
That's the way she liked to go around the corner of the wild man.

32:03.608 --> 32:04.990
But he didn't know she was unfair.

32:05.531 --> 32:06.993
And he didn't.

32:07.033 --> 32:07.874
That's my point.

32:07.914 --> 32:08.995
They were meant to marry.

32:09.015 --> 32:10.658
Everything they were meant to.

32:10.678 --> 32:16.245
Did your father ever talk about, did he have any recollections of slavery?

32:16.325 --> 32:17.507
Did he have any?

32:17.527 --> 32:18.228
That's a good question.

32:18.248 --> 32:18.848
You know why?

32:19.649 --> 32:20.811
After they were both dead,

32:21.145 --> 32:24.610
I said, I never asked them any questions.

32:24.630 --> 32:26.854
Never asked my father any questions.

32:26.874 --> 32:29.799
I think they probably didn't want us.

32:29.879 --> 32:30.399
I don't know.

32:31.942 --> 32:32.483
I don't know.

32:32.723 --> 32:33.825
Well, no, I don't think.

32:33.845 --> 32:38.031
I think it's because when you're a child, you're so wrapped up in yourself, you see.

32:38.372 --> 32:40.235
Because I have all been over here.

32:40.255 --> 32:46.124
I cannot tell you how many times I've said, my God, I didn't ask my father anything.

32:46.424 --> 32:48.047
What would you have liked to ask him?

32:50.272 --> 32:55.178
About slavery, of course, I knew a little bit about my mother's slavery because of the very situation.

32:55.318 --> 32:57.041
Your mother was also in his... Oh, no, no.

32:57.321 --> 32:58.282
I shouldn't say my mother.

32:58.583 --> 33:01.086
My grandfather, my mother's father.

33:02.307 --> 33:04.330
My mother, my mother's father.

33:05.271 --> 33:08.735
But I will have to say, I was a child who did not need my speech.

33:08.755 --> 33:09.937
I'm not being funny now.

33:09.957 --> 33:13.622
And they never talked about things like that before.

33:14.923 --> 33:16.085
But my mother had a thing.

33:16.325 --> 33:17.006
She'd ignore her.

33:17.126 --> 33:17.967
She makes you sick.

33:18.335 --> 33:28.430
Tell me, so you were an only child?

33:29.271 --> 33:38.284
Did you say your mother came?

33:40.458 --> 33:43.502
Well, she didn't exactly come up with her teacher.

33:44.203 --> 33:45.666
Well, you will see the show.

33:45.726 --> 33:51.053
Everybody, I get a standing ovation when I read that particular story about my mother.

33:51.093 --> 33:53.197
Because I start out, I guess that's my start.

33:53.217 --> 33:55.320
I find it as funny and you laugh and you laugh.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.082
And then I get a little joke.

33:57.102 --> 34:00.407
And then at the very end, I tell the story, this little girl.

34:00.725 --> 34:03.828
for growing up and never seeing her mother again.

34:04.189 --> 34:10.536
And then there's somebody, I get somebody back to the theater, I always get a standing, a standing old man, and I get a standing.

34:10.556 --> 34:15.521
But I make it now, it's the fourth, wait a minute, the short story is six silver dollars.

34:15.762 --> 34:16.823
That's the name of the story.

34:16.843 --> 34:17.844
That's the name of the story.

34:18.485 --> 34:30.478
And my point is, my father, my father's bank, and like this bank, and he gave me six, he gave my father six gold pieces to give me, and a little pocketbook.

34:30.661 --> 34:32.304
with a string on it.

34:32.465 --> 34:34.990
I had never had a pocketbook like that.

34:35.310 --> 34:39.198
And my mother, so I put this, so I took it out when I went out.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.783
And when I came back, my mother said, where are you?

34:43.787 --> 34:46.373
I had dropped it someplace, and so on.

34:46.533 --> 34:48.577
And so that's the way the story began.

34:48.998 --> 34:51.623
And my point is, and you are.

34:51.923 --> 34:55.028
And you laugh, and then at the end of the story.

34:55.849 --> 34:59.875
Well, I always do get quite a little trouble.

34:59.995 --> 35:01.537
And then, of course, I think I stopped.

35:01.878 --> 35:02.879
I'm very smart.

35:03.039 --> 35:04.281
I think I stopped that story.

35:04.542 --> 35:06.024
Maybe not that story.

35:06.044 --> 35:08.688
When they look at me, they say, she's awfully small.

35:09.088 --> 35:13.755
And then I tell them that story about my mother, who used to say, that's no child.

35:13.775 --> 35:15.278
That's a little thought-off woman.

35:15.298 --> 35:18.923
So then I'm letting them know that I know that I'm small, and I'm not.

35:19.063 --> 35:20.245
It doesn't bother me.

35:20.265 --> 35:21.026
Do you know what I mean?

35:21.467 --> 35:21.627
Yeah.

35:22.062 --> 35:27.389
So this was your mother who came up, and she said, who never saw her own mother again?

35:27.409 --> 35:28.751
Yeah, because, you know, I wrote the book.

35:29.011 --> 35:30.493
It became a creative writer.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.095
It wasn't my father.

35:32.115 --> 35:32.937
Oh, he did come up.

35:33.257 --> 35:38.925
But my point is, I told you about him coming up, up north, up to Springfield.

35:39.305 --> 35:43.991
And then he came to Boston, and became what's called, I think I wrote that someplace, The Black Banana King.

35:44.492 --> 35:44.792
Right.

35:44.812 --> 35:45.674
That's what's called.

35:45.754 --> 35:46.675
The Black Banana King?

35:46.695 --> 35:46.975
Oh, yeah.

35:47.516 --> 35:48.798
Well, you see, it's so interesting.

35:48.898 --> 35:49.879
Oh, you didn't know that?

35:50.200 --> 35:51.301
I don't know.

35:51.321 --> 35:51.501
No.

35:51.521 --> 35:52.002
Oh, no.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.056
Oh, isn't that interesting?

35:54.076 --> 35:57.201
Yes, because it's... Because there's no produce.

35:57.221 --> 35:57.441
Yeah.

35:57.802 --> 35:59.524
That means nothing to you.

35:59.545 --> 36:00.927
That means nothing to you.

36:00.947 --> 36:03.651
But the banana was a practically new thing.

36:04.211 --> 36:11.522
Only because my mother used to give her friends... We had... My father had brought the whole... What do you call it?

36:11.542 --> 36:13.024
The whole thing about bananas.

36:13.045 --> 36:13.926
Oh, I know what you mean.

36:13.946 --> 36:14.807
The whole tree.

36:15.268 --> 36:16.049
Yeah.

36:16.169 --> 36:19.474
And she would give it to her friends because they were rare.

36:19.825 --> 36:24.691
And that's why he was called the black banana king, because he had other food, too.

36:25.692 --> 36:28.576
Of course, he was in produce business.

36:28.616 --> 36:29.177
That's right.

36:29.197 --> 36:35.184
And the thing that—he was the only man—sometimes I say cynically—he was the only black man in the market.

36:35.204 --> 36:43.394
And my point is I'm very sure that sometimes there were black men looking for work, and they would say, no point am I going down there, because, you know, they wouldn't hire me.

36:43.775 --> 36:47.539
I think that was all white, because my father had a white bookkeeper.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.782
And the reason he had, because no black people—

36:49.762 --> 36:54.206
Nobody blasted her, you know, as they came there, you see.

36:54.626 --> 37:06.857
Let's talk, now you were an only child, as you told us, and yet you were a young woman, almost a girl, really, when you went off to New York, and this was the beginning of what we call the Harlem Renaissance.

37:07.017 --> 37:13.683
How did your family feel about letting their only daughter, their only child, go out by herself to New York City?

37:14.303 --> 37:15.144
I mean, I'm amazed.

37:15.164 --> 37:15.885
Well, you know what?

37:16.325 --> 37:17.186
I thought about that.

37:18.567 --> 37:19.768
You know why she let me go?

37:20.423 --> 37:24.468
Because her mother let her go when she was 14.

37:25.770 --> 37:29.015
I said, that's why she let us go.

37:29.035 --> 37:31.698
Because her mother let her go.

37:31.718 --> 37:39.148
And that story, when you read that about my drawing, because they stood hand in hand.

37:39.529 --> 37:45.677
And my grandmother was saying, may God watch between me and thee while we are after one from another.

37:45.877 --> 37:47.399
So I thought about that.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.143
And then one day, I said, of course.

37:50.647 --> 37:53.833
She let us go, because her mother let us go.

37:53.853 --> 37:55.056
Little 14-year-old girl.

37:55.296 --> 37:56.819
She knew she'd never wanted to.

37:56.839 --> 37:59.945
She was a tomboy, and a half she'd never wanted to, I'm sure.

38:01.027 --> 38:03.091
Were you scared about going to New York?

38:03.712 --> 38:04.093
No!

38:04.614 --> 38:06.057
Do you know, was it Harry Bailey?

38:06.718 --> 38:09.403
The name, Harry Bailey, well, sorry.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.790
He was a musician.

38:13.867 --> 38:16.131
And he was, you would not know the spirituals.

38:16.492 --> 38:21.600
The reason I'm saying that, he was a fair-skinned man, is because I get so tired of people saying, who looks so-and-so because he looks like white.

38:21.981 --> 38:26.729
No, Booker T. Washington was a brown-skinned man.

38:27.571 --> 38:36.246
And I had a friend around the road, over there, whose fair-skinned grandmother taught Booker T. Washington to read.

38:36.378 --> 38:53.071
And my point is, if he had not, when he looked at her fair face, he did not say, I'm going to talk about these people who was so-and-so thing just because he's like, because she was like, she had white blood, and she had been taught my dad how to read, and Booksy Washington did not say, I don't want her, do you understand what I'm saying?

38:53.191 --> 38:56.698
And that's, because that's what so many people say, who does so-and-so thing?

38:57.556 --> 38:59.961
Because I get that from my mother.

39:00.001 --> 39:01.605
There were 12 women in so-and-so.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.148
And I just don't understand.

39:03.168 --> 39:06.696
Because, just as I told you, the president was prejudiced.

39:06.716 --> 39:10.224
And when I say prejudiced, I'm not really prejudiced, but myself.

39:10.244 --> 39:12.308
And I didn't... Do you understand what I'm saying?

39:12.625 --> 39:14.547
Because when I looked at my mother, she's nice.

39:14.587 --> 39:17.470
So when I look at a dark woman, then I don't see my mother.

39:17.890 --> 39:18.991
It has nothing to do with color.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.613
It's just that I don't see my mother.

39:20.893 --> 39:25.138
And as I told you what my mother said, I would hate to live in a world where everybody looked alike.

39:25.158 --> 39:27.200
I would hate to live in a world where everybody looked like me.

39:27.460 --> 39:30.763
But I just felt that she looked, and she was a mother.

39:31.064 --> 39:38.251
And what I mean, that's all she did was take care of the children, all of her sister's children, because they worked, and my father was not poor, so that she didn't have to work.

39:38.571 --> 39:40.253
So when you went to New York,

39:40.688 --> 39:41.529
The Magic City.

39:41.789 --> 39:43.150
We always called it the Magic City.

39:43.170 --> 39:49.937
Did you have a sense that you were going to be taking part in this great cultural and artistic explosion that we called the Harlem Renaissance?

39:49.957 --> 39:52.900
Did you have any idea that you would be a part of it?

39:52.920 --> 40:01.208
Yeah, but it's interesting when you say it's called the Harlem Renaissance, because we didn't know it was the Harlem Renaissance.

40:01.849 --> 40:02.730
Well, I wrote that piece.

40:02.810 --> 40:04.131
You'll see that piece in the collection.

40:05.152 --> 40:08.856
And my point is, it became, they called it the Harlem Renaissance.

40:09.106 --> 40:11.088
Because when Wally died, you will have to read that.

40:11.268 --> 40:14.191
When Wally died, we realized that we were models.

40:14.331 --> 40:14.891
Who died?

40:15.172 --> 40:15.912
Wallace Thurman.

40:16.032 --> 40:16.493
Okay.

40:16.513 --> 40:17.554
Now, he was our lead leader.

40:17.574 --> 40:20.316
You will know nothing about him, but you know nothing about him.

40:20.336 --> 40:25.581
But when you read that, you will see he was very important to us.

40:25.681 --> 40:28.904
Somebody had given this woman, had given him a great big studio.

40:29.325 --> 40:32.128
This woman, I forgot about her name, but it doesn't make any difference.

40:32.148 --> 40:38.033
But the point is, she admired him because he had gone to college, he had brains, he was writing books, and she let him have a lot.

40:38.502 --> 40:41.126
And therefore, we used to assemble there.

40:41.166 --> 40:42.849
The loft, I guess.

40:42.869 --> 40:43.890
The loft, L-O-S-T.

40:44.191 --> 40:51.862
And of course, I was only 18, I guess something, and I never opened my mouth.

40:51.942 --> 40:56.770
But did you know that you were part of something that was really extraordinary?

40:56.790 --> 40:57.731
Well, that's my point.

40:58.072 --> 40:59.093
That's my point.

40:59.113 --> 41:04.982
I mean, you had Langston Hughes, and you had all these extraordinary people, artists.

41:08.118 --> 41:15.807
an amazing occurrence, and I'm wondering if you appreciated it, if you had a sense that this was really a great moment.

41:16.588 --> 41:17.108
I don't know.

41:17.128 --> 41:19.691
They were all very kind of horrible.

41:19.711 --> 41:30.143
I was a virgin, and my point is very interesting to me when I see these young girls carrying them with babies at the age of 15 and so on and so on, because, seriously, they were all so protective of me.

41:30.604 --> 41:32.045
They knew that I was married.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.687
I guess you could tell a person I don't know.

41:33.869 --> 41:38.595
But they knew that, and they were all very careful with me, and very kind.

41:39.476 --> 41:39.897
Yes.

41:40.918 --> 41:43.281
They took care of me.

41:43.621 --> 41:49.929
Yes, because I remember I was no longer there, and it was altogether different.

41:49.949 --> 41:51.611
Well, we're not going to ask you to talk about that.

41:51.931 --> 41:53.493
Well, I mean, people are kind.

41:53.634 --> 41:54.755
I mean, they do, yes.

41:55.296 --> 41:57.358
Well, I'll tell you what happened to Europe.

41:57.378 --> 41:59.821
I was the only one that happened by herself.

42:00.302 --> 42:01.884
I told you that, didn't I?

42:01.904 --> 42:03.606
Oh, I went to Europe.

42:04.328 --> 42:06.310
Oh, God.

42:07.271 --> 42:10.135
Well, I think I told you that I wanted to write plays now.

42:10.875 --> 42:11.696
Oh, did I tell you that?

42:12.377 --> 42:13.939
All right.

42:14.039 --> 42:15.220
I guess without knowing you.

42:15.901 --> 42:21.047
My mother said to me, that's no child, that's a little, that's a little, that's a little child, woman.

42:21.287 --> 42:22.308
I guess I was never a child.

42:22.328 --> 42:22.769
I don't know.

42:22.789 --> 42:25.792
But at any rate, I wrote to the Theater Guild.

42:26.193 --> 42:27.054
Do you know that name?

42:27.334 --> 42:27.855
You wouldn't know.

42:27.915 --> 42:28.636
Oh, you do know.

42:28.876 --> 42:29.316
Yeah.

42:29.557 --> 42:31.639
Yeah, famous Theater Guild.

42:31.659 --> 42:32.200
That's right.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.302
Because James, what James?

42:34.754 --> 42:39.641
at their big committee, and we were all very special up there, and her husband, yeah.

42:40.802 --> 42:49.153
Oh, well, I thought I told you that I wrote them a letter and said that I would like to write a play for them, and I told them I was 19.

42:49.894 --> 42:58.386
And the reason I told them out of 19, I didn't want them to be very small, and I didn't want them to think that I was only 17 years old.

42:58.406 --> 42:59.748
We'll forget this day.

43:00.268 --> 43:01.490
There were children in the play.

43:01.550 --> 43:02.431
I saw this over here.

43:02.632 --> 43:04.474
There were children in the play, and

43:05.213 --> 43:07.078
I was sitting there by myself, kind of a loner.

43:07.399 --> 43:16.742
I was sitting there by myself, and this man, the woman who won the leading roles came in, and she said to this man,

43:16.874 --> 43:28.098
I said, I beg your pardon, I'm not a little girl, I'm 19.

43:28.118 --> 43:31.546
And they burst out laughing, and I thought they didn't believe me.

43:32.027 --> 43:35.895
But to that 19, what did she call me?

43:36.415 --> 43:40.520
Did you write the play?

43:40.680 --> 43:41.961
Did you write that up?

43:41.981 --> 43:42.362
No, they didn't.

43:42.422 --> 43:43.543
No, but I don't remember what I wrote.

43:43.843 --> 43:47.247
But evidently, they enjoyed my letter.

43:47.707 --> 43:51.872
And so they told me to, and they knew that they were going to do the play Porgy.

43:51.912 --> 43:53.314
Did you hear the play Porgy?

43:53.734 --> 43:54.195
Oh, all right.

43:54.395 --> 43:56.277
They knew that they were going to do the play Porgy.

43:56.337 --> 43:59.861
They told you that little story, didn't they?

43:59.881 --> 44:01.883
Oh, maybe you think I have a Boston accent.

44:02.808 --> 44:05.311
It was as thick as you can.

44:05.331 --> 44:12.120
There's no way they describe the action that I'm not about.

44:12.281 --> 44:17.367
But my point is, they told me to come there.

44:17.407 --> 44:21.232
And I went very heavily, because I thought they were going to let me write a play for them.

44:21.273 --> 44:22.134
But no, they didn't.

44:22.154 --> 44:23.956
Oh, you didn't know that?

44:23.976 --> 44:24.877
I didn't tell you that?

44:24.897 --> 44:25.058
No, no.

44:25.378 --> 44:25.498
Oh.

44:25.919 --> 44:32.207
And so therefore, Ruben Amuli, and he was called the boy, I think he was 30 years old, someone saw it.

44:33.402 --> 44:41.474
And so they were selecting people, and I actually had a thick Boston accent, and he talked to me.

44:41.494 --> 44:47.923
He talked to me, and then he, well, so there was a request, and then there were people that they were taking.

44:47.943 --> 44:51.869
So that therefore, I talked to him in my Boston accent.

44:52.470 --> 44:54.533
He said, go to the

44:55.019 --> 44:56.601
Yeah, the rejection.

44:56.621 --> 45:00.245
And somebody rushed up to them and said something to him.

45:00.506 --> 45:04.911
And the reason I'll never forget is because his voice was so full of this stuff.

45:04.931 --> 45:08.695
The little girl in the blue dress, go over there.

45:09.937 --> 45:10.698
Let me ask you a question.

45:10.718 --> 45:13.681
You've lived here now since 1947, I think.

45:13.701 --> 45:14.642
Is it 1947?

45:14.883 --> 45:15.403
I read that.

45:15.523 --> 45:17.426
Oh, I think when the president died.

45:17.446 --> 45:19.849
1943?

45:20.550 --> 45:22.612
Which president?

45:22.632 --> 45:22.712
FDR?

45:23.533 --> 45:24.334
He died in 42.

45:24.719 --> 45:27.483
In any case, you've lived here for at least 50 years.

45:27.823 --> 45:29.285
Oh, yeah.

45:29.385 --> 45:30.887
I've never lived here any place.

45:31.789 --> 45:32.269
No, why?

45:32.610 --> 45:35.754
Why have you lived here so much of your life on the island?

45:35.774 --> 45:39.800
Because, oh my dear, the interesting thing is, I never met you.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.123
Everything happens.

45:42.524 --> 45:44.186
So maybe it happens the way it should be.

45:44.386 --> 45:50.895
The last thing that happened is, a man that I knew and loved and so on, I was going to meet him.

45:51.652 --> 45:53.735
I didn't tell anybody.

45:53.755 --> 45:55.878
No, I was going to meet him.

45:56.118 --> 46:00.704
He had come back from the bar, and I was going to meet him in the station.

46:00.824 --> 46:03.188
That's right.

46:03.268 --> 46:05.891
I was going to meet him.

46:05.911 --> 46:07.634
I didn't tell my family there was anything.

46:08.114 --> 46:12.240
And one of the children decided to have high fever.

46:12.260 --> 46:16.285
I did not know how to leave this house with my mother alone.

46:16.305 --> 46:18.108
And that was that.

46:18.308 --> 46:19.650
So you missed the meeting?

46:19.900 --> 46:20.861
That's right.

46:20.881 --> 46:22.404
You didn't show up.

46:22.424 --> 46:23.045
I didn't show up.

46:23.405 --> 46:27.511
Understandably, he thought I had done this deliberately.

46:27.531 --> 46:30.195
This is somebody you knew before the war?

46:30.215 --> 46:31.837
Yeah.

46:32.358 --> 46:35.142
Somebody from New York or from Boston?

46:35.162 --> 46:37.426
From Boston, some from that area, you see.

46:37.526 --> 46:39.689
And of course, he just came back from the war.

46:39.869 --> 46:42.052
So he had no address, you see.

46:42.533 --> 46:45.958
And of course, he thought that I had decided I...

46:47.035 --> 46:49.377
How did you know what day he was coming in?

46:49.497 --> 46:50.879
Oh, well, no, we knew.

46:51.059 --> 46:51.359
I knew.

46:51.620 --> 46:52.600
We had corresponded.

46:52.620 --> 46:57.125
Only I just didn't say anything, too, because I knew that this was the day, yeah.

46:57.345 --> 46:59.247
But the child was full fever.

46:59.607 --> 47:04.572
My mother would see it, too, but I did not know how to leave, believe it, believe it.

47:04.592 --> 47:05.673
So you didn't get to leave?

47:05.773 --> 47:06.895
Well, that happens all the time.

47:06.915 --> 47:08.376
That happens all the time.

47:08.396 --> 47:11.279
So I dare say I don't know whether I was meant to get married or not.

47:11.379 --> 47:11.879
I don't know.

47:12.280 --> 47:15.523
So how did that bring you down to the island?

47:16.533 --> 47:17.395
No, I was here.

47:18.258 --> 47:19.260
You were here on the island.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.245
Wasn't the child here?

47:21.606 --> 47:26.980
No, I was on the island, with my mother and the child.

47:27.161 --> 47:30.369
So your parents used to come down to the island years ago.

47:30.389 --> 47:31.151
Oh, my.

47:31.171 --> 47:32.455
Oh, well, then you didn't know that.

47:32.575 --> 47:33.377
Don't remember.

47:33.813 --> 47:45.205
I had my first birthday with my father.

47:45.825 --> 48:02.723
Then I had my first birthday that day, that day my birthday, and then the next day

48:03.631 --> 48:05.814
She brought me to the island.

48:05.854 --> 48:07.537
What's your birthday?

48:07.557 --> 48:08.859
June 2nd.

48:08.939 --> 48:10.061
On the second day.

48:10.361 --> 48:13.266
Oh, you know, you know, there are a million dates.

48:13.927 --> 48:15.429
A million dates on my birthday.

48:15.729 --> 48:20.476
And I think the English people, I think there was a type of guy with a glass of hair or something.

48:20.496 --> 48:22.920
So I think, I don't know what that was.

48:22.940 --> 48:25.504
So anyway, you didn't get to Boston to meet the train.

48:26.277 --> 48:27.038
That's right.

48:27.259 --> 48:28.340
I wasn't even going to Boston.

48:28.440 --> 48:32.547
Well, what I mean by this, I was going to meet him in the station because that's the whole point.

48:32.587 --> 48:34.810
He had no place to go.

48:34.831 --> 48:37.475
I mean, he was, do you see what I'm saying?

48:37.495 --> 48:39.237
So he had no address.

48:39.258 --> 48:45.988
And of course, I'm sure that there was this, so I, well, it happened, it happened all the time.

48:46.188 --> 48:51.817
But I think maybe it was meant to be, because I know I wouldn't have written it.

48:51.877 --> 48:54.141
Why did you stay in the island?

48:55.015 --> 49:02.767
Well, I didn't mean to say I had an apartment, and I had a job with my mother, and I had something, and this happened, and that happened.

49:02.787 --> 49:06.112
So my point being, I decided that maybe it was meant to be.

49:06.132 --> 49:06.593
I don't know.

49:06.853 --> 49:08.195
So you just stayed here?

49:08.235 --> 49:09.216
Yeah, well, I had no choice.

49:09.477 --> 49:10.959
Well, when I said I had no choice.

49:11.019 --> 49:16.467
Is this different from the rest of America, in your view, or is it just a very nice, comfortable place for you to live?

49:16.848 --> 49:17.489
Oh, well, no.

49:18.250 --> 49:21.495
Yes, because I came here as a child, as you know.

49:21.813 --> 49:22.214
Right?

49:22.234 --> 49:22.874
He told us that.

49:22.994 --> 49:23.515
Yeah.

49:23.535 --> 49:25.858
And I think that there is something about this island.

49:26.219 --> 49:32.386
Sooner or later, almost so many people I know, the husband is dead or the children are gone, and they come down here and live here year out.

49:32.727 --> 49:35.731
Oh, there's so many, many, many people do that.

49:35.931 --> 49:37.253
And I think that's it.

49:37.273 --> 49:42.319
And as I told you when I was a little girl, reading the gravestones,

49:42.957 --> 49:47.585
Even though I was a child, I was aware that this person was 80 years old or something.

49:47.965 --> 49:49.488
And that was a lot of years.

49:49.889 --> 49:52.393
And then I think it began to come into my mind.

49:52.553 --> 49:53.655
What if you live on the island?

49:54.256 --> 49:58.343
And I will have to say this, I was a child when I came here in the summer.

49:58.363 --> 49:59.685
I didn't think they had any school years.

50:00.646 --> 50:01.848
But you didn't have to go.

50:01.868 --> 50:07.598
And a friend of mine, a grown friend, came down here in a fur coat one summer, one winter.

50:08.708 --> 50:13.854
because she had to want to see a plumber and that was, you know, her man or whatever, something about the house or something.

50:14.274 --> 50:18.219
And she said, Dottie, there's no... She's made with a grown woman in a black coat.

50:19.180 --> 50:21.202
Dottie, there's no leaves on the trees.

50:21.222 --> 50:25.587
And you see, when I came here, I thought there was no space.

50:25.607 --> 50:26.669
But you see, I think that's it.

50:26.729 --> 50:31.134
And then, you see, if you're a child out there, a lot of people don't misunderstand me.

50:31.154 --> 50:33.757
There are plenty of people who come home, and I'm like, God, I can't stand this place.

50:34.477 --> 50:38.462
And it's interesting, if the husband is nice to have to want to stay,

50:38.780 --> 50:40.342
And it's the way.

50:40.362 --> 50:41.223
Oh, can you say that?

50:41.264 --> 50:43.427
Do you understand that?

50:43.447 --> 50:44.889
It doesn't make sense to me, I guess.

50:44.909 --> 50:45.289
All right.

50:46.110 --> 50:53.040
Now, did you know Mr. Barnes, the art collector, was with his first name?

50:53.060 --> 50:53.321
Dr. Alfred.

50:53.341 --> 50:55.404
Dr. Alfred Barnes, the Philadelphia man.

50:55.824 --> 50:57.627
I don't know, because I get so much mail.

50:57.847 --> 50:59.590
Now, this is going back in the hollow way.

50:59.730 --> 51:01.032
Oh, no, no, no.

51:02.554 --> 51:04.737
Do you think that there could be another period of...

51:05.611 --> 51:07.954
I am asked that all the time.

51:08.034 --> 51:09.276
I don't think so.

51:09.296 --> 51:09.816
No.

51:09.836 --> 51:12.980
I don't think so because it's altogether different.

51:13.361 --> 51:15.183
I think it's because we have, but we didn't have it.

51:15.203 --> 51:16.084
We've gone together.

51:16.905 --> 51:18.107
See, I think that has to do.

51:18.367 --> 51:21.631
I told you I got my little thing from the play.

51:21.771 --> 51:26.077
I got something that had a little alarm for my family.

51:26.097 --> 51:26.737
They knew that.

51:27.278 --> 51:27.999
My friends knew that.

51:28.379 --> 51:31.724
And then, in addition to that, I got money from being in the play.

51:32.785 --> 51:34.487
And that my friends borrowed that money.

51:34.805 --> 51:39.751
When I said bound, I'm sure they never played exactly.

51:39.771 --> 51:45.137
So you think that this is what we call the Harlem Renaissance, but you didn't have any name for it then.

51:45.457 --> 51:47.900
But whatever it was, you think that only happens once.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.802
Oh, I think that can't happen.

51:49.822 --> 51:51.904
That kind of thing can't happen.

51:51.944 --> 51:54.227
Well, I think that's the last thing I wrote.

51:54.347 --> 51:55.549
It will never happen again.

51:56.009 --> 51:58.171
We were innocent, you see.

51:58.772 --> 52:00.054
But you were excited, too.

52:00.474 --> 52:01.515
You were so creative.

52:01.555 --> 52:03.057
That's right.

52:03.340 --> 52:04.842
you were really making a statement.

52:05.062 --> 52:14.093
Now, when I think that, when they tell me that you are the last surviving member of this group, how do you want people to remember you?

52:14.113 --> 52:14.794
How do you want you?

52:14.894 --> 52:15.735
I hadn't thought about that.

52:16.015 --> 52:19.800
I told you how shocked I was, didn't I?

52:19.820 --> 52:26.488
Oh, and they gave a thing, I am one of the, what did they go, women?

52:27.209 --> 52:30.653
And how about a ragged, I guess, did something with women.

52:30.673 --> 52:32.976
And women would have been in the Halliburton, one thing or another.

52:33.209 --> 52:37.956
And they gave dinner for them.

52:37.976 --> 52:39.939
Now it is their chance to give me a dinner.

52:39.959 --> 52:41.602
And it was in the Boston papers.

52:41.722 --> 52:42.503
I did not know that.

52:42.903 --> 52:43.164
All right.

52:43.524 --> 52:47.110
But my point is, it wasn't against the Boston papers.

52:47.130 --> 52:51.396
Therefore, when I got there, I did not know anything about that.

52:51.516 --> 52:54.180
I knew the place was packed.

52:54.741 --> 52:57.746
They had put extra tables, extra chairs in one thing or another.

52:58.306 --> 52:59.368
But my point is,

53:00.395 --> 53:03.839
This woman will never know how I felt because I'm a pretty good actress.

53:04.199 --> 53:09.465
She introduced me, and she said, Dorothy West is the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance.

53:10.246 --> 53:11.467
I've never thought about it.

53:11.847 --> 53:15.751
I'll never forget that moment as long as I live.

53:16.192 --> 53:20.296
That's why the place is packed, to see the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance.

53:20.356 --> 53:22.459
I think you're ready to play on it for you, too.

53:22.479 --> 53:22.699
Sure, sure.

53:22.719 --> 53:23.580
Well, bless your heart.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.061
Bless your heart for saying that.

53:25.081 --> 53:26.783
Well, I will say this about myself.

53:26.803 --> 53:28.545
That's my background, my mother.

53:28.829 --> 53:29.650
I hung in there.

53:29.670 --> 53:31.373
I've always hung in there.

53:31.393 --> 53:32.274
Yeah.

53:32.294 --> 53:32.855
All right.

53:32.895 --> 53:38.562
Now, how about to ask that question once more, how would you like to be remembered?

53:39.123 --> 53:43.529
How would you like to be remembered 50 years from now, 100 years?

53:43.589 --> 53:46.553
Well, tell me a little joke about Bostonians.

53:46.614 --> 53:48.035
The Bostonian is born.

53:48.316 --> 53:49.137
It's in the newspaper.

53:49.177 --> 53:52.201
I'm not talking black people, but particularly that's the Bostonian is born.

53:52.442 --> 53:53.503
It's in the newspaper.

53:53.838 --> 53:58.987
And then he gets married, and that's in the newspaper.

53:59.247 --> 54:02.312
Then they have their birth child, that's in the newspaper.

54:02.332 --> 54:03.795
Then they die, that's in the newspaper.

54:03.815 --> 54:04.676
That's it.

54:04.696 --> 54:07.441
I mean, there's no—that's all there is to it, you see.

54:07.821 --> 54:11.948
And so there's a thing of—I think that's why I surprised a lot of this.

54:12.299 --> 54:16.425
Because being a Bostonian then, you just... Now, we're talking about the old Bostonians.

54:16.445 --> 54:22.814
Now, maybe this is something different, but in my day, and I'm not seeing funny, and you... I don't know, what was this writer's book?

54:22.854 --> 54:26.018
Blue Bloods, a wonderful book that he wrote about the Bostonians.

54:27.220 --> 54:30.124
And one, because I'm like that, too, in this respect.

54:30.144 --> 54:35.271
The one day, the cook forgot the... No, not Henry James.

54:35.351 --> 54:38.395
This man is very interested in animals now.

54:38.996 --> 54:40.619
Oh, he's still waiting?

54:40.639 --> 54:40.939
Yeah.

54:41.088 --> 54:42.875
I don't know who it is.

54:42.895 --> 54:45.765
All right, well, all right, he's an old Boston, one of the oldest names.

54:46.147 --> 54:51.165
And this man, he wrote about, he was writing about real people.
