WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:28.683
I wonder how he's going to feel when my theory of fiction comes up.

00:28.903 --> 00:32.687
In which I...

00:33.933 --> 00:40.619
Well, let's say my esteem for Mr. Rushdie's work and the type of work he does is minimal.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.163
Well, that's another way of putting it.

00:44.443 --> 00:48.527
I wrote a practitioner's theory of fiction, which is now the Hudson Review.

00:48.567 --> 00:56.475
Joe Epstein said it was too specialized for a man and scholar, and I think he's probably right.

00:57.116 --> 00:59.438
I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name correctly.

00:59.578 --> 01:00.118
Something like that.

01:00.138 --> 01:03.822
I've heard it three or four ways, so any way you like is the way to pronounce it.

01:04.156 --> 01:08.986
Well, I've read his books on fiction.

01:09.847 --> 01:13.675
I tried to read The Unbearable Wetness of Being, but frankly, I found the title too long.

01:13.755 --> 01:14.437
It's just unbearable.

01:17.002 --> 01:24.156
It's like the night I allowed my wife to cite many, many ballgames to talk me into going to see Ivan the Terrible.

01:25.385 --> 01:28.469
I don't know whether... It was Ivan the Interminable.

01:29.550 --> 01:33.275
Did you ever see the one that was based on Les Miserables?

01:33.295 --> 01:33.856
Yes, I did.

01:33.876 --> 01:36.620
You know what the problem with those things is?

01:36.660 --> 01:37.681
It's Andrew Lloyd Webber.

01:37.721 --> 01:39.243
Not that he wrote that one.

01:39.283 --> 01:43.308
Lloyd Webber was the inventor of the theory that it only takes one song to make a musical.

01:43.328 --> 01:44.410
He only has one.

01:44.570 --> 01:47.994
There's Memories and Cats and the Music of the Night and the Phantom of the Opera.

01:49.136 --> 01:50.638
Yes.

01:50.658 --> 01:51.499
Tom, who is it?

01:51.539 --> 01:53.822
Tom, don't pretend you put it in.

01:53.802 --> 02:17.852
Can you imagine what the liability insurance is on that chandelier?

02:18.794 --> 02:23.400
something like $480 to see that musical on Broadway.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.942
I had become obsessed.

02:26.223 --> 02:27.905
It was the really useful theater company.

02:28.386 --> 02:30.429
And Greg Gowrie, my friend, was still on the board.

02:30.489 --> 02:31.830
I don't think he was chairman anymore.

02:31.850 --> 02:34.854
And he assured me tickets would be waiting in New York.

02:34.874 --> 02:37.537
So when I got to New York, I asked for the tickets and gave my name.

02:37.557 --> 02:41.983
And this guy in there, classic New Yorker, perfect New Yorker, gives me the fisheye and says, oh,

02:43.415 --> 02:45.679
That's New York.

02:45.719 --> 02:49.625
He'd already given it to a friend of his.

02:49.645 --> 02:49.906
That's right.

02:49.926 --> 02:52.610
So by then, as I say, it had become a fetish with me.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.054
I'd been to New York three or four times, and I wanted to see that.

02:55.094 --> 02:56.697
It had nothing to do with the merits of the case.

02:56.737 --> 02:57.939
I just wanted to see it.

02:57.959 --> 03:01.805
I think I paid $480 to the concierge of the standholder.

03:01.825 --> 03:02.967
That's a lot of money.

03:02.987 --> 03:03.668
I was a fool.

03:04.222 --> 03:06.445
That's a stupid thing to do.

03:06.485 --> 03:08.849
Don't get obsessed.

03:08.969 --> 03:11.633
Anyway, let's start a little bit.

03:11.693 --> 03:13.436
Let's get some nice quotes.

03:13.896 --> 03:19.425
And if it seems like we're covering old ground... We are.

03:19.445 --> 03:20.526
You got something to show me?

03:20.546 --> 03:22.249
I've got the usual standard press buyout.

03:22.489 --> 03:23.330
I like that.

03:23.491 --> 03:25.133
It saves everybody a lot of...

03:25.248 --> 03:27.691
Well, I mean, you know, quotes about it.

03:27.711 --> 03:30.934
I went, oh, you've got a hint of madness.

03:30.954 --> 03:31.034
Wow.

03:31.054 --> 03:31.875
This is the first.

03:32.255 --> 03:32.776
A first to me.

03:32.796 --> 03:37.341
I have never before brought the interviewer's book in for him to find.

03:37.361 --> 03:39.583
Well, it's true.

03:39.763 --> 03:40.664
Absolutely true.

03:41.405 --> 03:42.426
And don't lose my place here.

03:42.446 --> 03:45.709
As I told you, I just started the book when you would call.

03:45.789 --> 03:47.671
I'm going to do it on the half-title.

03:47.812 --> 03:48.452
You should.

03:48.472 --> 03:49.213
Yep.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.516
There's various protocols on that.

03:51.756 --> 03:52.518
Good.

03:52.538 --> 03:54.481
Well, this is one for the agents.

03:54.501 --> 03:58.148
It's the first time it's ever happened.

03:58.168 --> 04:00.051
Can you imagine the number of interviews I've had?

04:00.692 --> 04:03.237
You're the first interviewer I've had in 25 years.

04:03.257 --> 04:06.222
25 years ago, next February.

04:06.262 --> 04:11.151
25 years is the first time it's ever happened here or in England or in Germany or in France, anywhere.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.569
Usually they give up.

04:13.531 --> 04:14.572
You write a book.

04:14.812 --> 04:16.615
You don't continue to do what I do.

04:17.055 --> 04:17.796
But I like it.

04:17.876 --> 04:18.697
Of course you do.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.320
It's like me missing trials.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.062
That's why I like teaching so much.

04:22.082 --> 04:23.223
You're not always perfect.

04:23.243 --> 04:23.744
Yes, I am.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.546
I love having a deadline.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.589
I love the immediacy of the byline.

04:27.870 --> 04:30.513
Byline of hearing from people in Eugene, Oregon.

04:30.533 --> 04:31.594
I like my story.

04:31.735 --> 04:38.944
One of my biggest thrills was the B-52 from the Strategic Air Command ran into trouble.

04:39.093 --> 04:40.455
over Greenland or someplace.

04:40.515 --> 04:42.358
I'm one of those, you know, they were always on patrol.

04:44.201 --> 04:50.210
And it was going to land at Pease Air Force Base, and there was a question of a landing gear that would deploy, and there was an H-Bomber board.

04:51.853 --> 04:55.098
And I had gone home from the night shift at 8.30.

04:55.118 --> 05:00.866
My parents were out in Seattle, at the National Education Association, I imagine.

05:00.886 --> 05:06.175
And after about four or five hours sleep, I got a call from 8.30 Boston.

05:06.195 --> 05:07.817
They wanted a man up there.

05:08.253 --> 05:14.782
and I had Courtesy of the Rogue, and I had a TR4 Triumph.

05:14.922 --> 05:19.128
I was told to put my flashes on, and the cops had my license number, and they were going to let me through.

05:19.168 --> 05:30.925
I had large platinum-pointed plugs, and I was about 23 years old, and I was like a kid in the candy store.

05:31.005 --> 05:36.673
And the next morning, when my parents got up in Seattle and got the newspaper,

05:36.653 --> 05:40.218
I led the paper with that story out of P's Air Force Base.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.100
It was great.

05:42.841 --> 05:44.684
Nothing like it.

05:45.205 --> 05:48.810
It's adrenaline.

05:48.830 --> 05:49.450
It's a kick.

05:49.490 --> 05:49.951
Yes, it is.

05:50.011 --> 05:50.632
It's adrenaline.

05:50.652 --> 05:51.814
It's a kick in the ass.

05:51.954 --> 05:52.875
It's wonderful.

05:53.055 --> 06:04.231
I drove to New York last week on a Wednesday morning, drove down a few Mario games, came back, transcribed a tape, did the thing on deadline, and beat everybody.

06:04.371 --> 06:04.551
Okay.

06:04.531 --> 06:09.219
Oh, it's a natural.

06:09.960 --> 06:17.913
What do you got, an auto tax, an auto-vailing tax?

06:17.933 --> 06:19.696
Yeah, exactly.

06:19.836 --> 06:23.622
Those things are made for guys of our generation.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.003
Exactly.

06:24.023 --> 06:25.205
They are made for it.

06:25.225 --> 06:26.106
Yeah, it's wonderful.

06:26.126 --> 06:27.348
I couldn't do it.

06:27.368 --> 06:28.530
I sent it.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.035
Matt Buckley, you must know Matt.

06:30.075 --> 06:32.084
I'm going to see him in a couple of weeks.

06:32.164 --> 06:33.329
So am I. You going to that thing?

06:33.389 --> 06:34.052
I am, yeah.

06:34.072 --> 06:34.694
Well, I'll see you there.

06:34.714 --> 06:35.578
Oh, all right, yeah.

06:35.618 --> 06:37.185
I'm going to try and write about it for some reason.

06:37.205 --> 06:38.048
Well, I think you should.

06:38.332 --> 06:41.717
Anyway, it's really amazing.

06:41.937 --> 06:47.165
Yeah, obviously it doesn't intimidate him.

06:47.205 --> 06:48.287
No, this is a must.

06:48.347 --> 06:49.809
This is a command for pharmacy.

06:49.829 --> 06:51.892
And Rick Lehman was saying, you don't have to do that.

06:51.912 --> 06:52.974
I said, you do have to do this.

06:53.014 --> 06:57.981
This guy has been a sedulous promoter of me and my work for 25 years.

06:58.001 --> 06:58.442
Matt is?

06:58.462 --> 06:59.043
Yeah.

06:59.063 --> 06:59.744
Something about that.

06:59.764 --> 07:02.367
I am interested in that.

07:02.387 --> 07:05.592
Matt spotted me before Eddie Coyle was officially published.

07:05.612 --> 07:05.833
Really?

07:05.933 --> 07:06.534
Yeah.

07:06.554 --> 07:07.495
He gets galleys.

07:07.475 --> 07:10.902
And he's a collector, he's an assassin.

07:10.922 --> 07:11.325
Yes, sure he is.

07:11.693 --> 07:14.135
I was surprised not to find his name in your index.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.838
No, no, he's here.

07:16.898 --> 07:18.059
He wasn't in the index, I thought.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.801
He's not in the index, but he's in the video.

07:20.102 --> 07:20.682
Okay.

07:20.702 --> 07:24.566
And when I read it to him in New York, he said, he knew me.

07:24.666 --> 07:25.147
I'm excited.

07:25.327 --> 07:27.569
He said, I like your book.

07:27.589 --> 07:29.151
I have your book, and I'm impressed.

07:29.191 --> 07:30.832
And I said, I have all of your books.

07:31.053 --> 07:34.096
And I said, not only am I impressed, I said, but I used them.

07:34.396 --> 07:38.701
His new Hemingway book, Hemingway and Perkins, is delightful.

07:38.721 --> 07:40.182
I haven't seen it in public.

07:40.162 --> 07:41.404
Well, who's published?

07:41.484 --> 07:42.124
Scrivener.

07:42.525 --> 07:43.947
I don't have it.

07:44.127 --> 07:44.688
Do you have it on me?

07:44.708 --> 07:48.272
I have the Vangelis because I plugged it.

07:48.292 --> 07:48.753
Oh, Scrivener.

07:49.494 --> 07:50.575
It's a wonderful book.

07:51.796 --> 07:53.959
The only thing that really counts.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.002
I think that's the book.

07:56.322 --> 07:57.884
In time to lose it on?

07:57.984 --> 08:01.128
It's Letters Between Max Perkins and Ernest Hennig.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.992
It's a wonderful book, too.

08:04.432 --> 08:05.854
For some reason or another.

08:05.874 --> 08:07.536
My first editor was Ash Green.

08:07.921 --> 08:13.248
who was probably CIA when he was theoretically Naval Intelligence.

08:13.388 --> 08:15.271
And I used it.

08:15.291 --> 08:23.962
I'll call my stuff on the... See, I'm only up to Lord Chesterfield's letters.

08:24.363 --> 08:28.328
You know, I thought a first of that.

08:30.090 --> 08:32.693
Lord Chesterfield's letters.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.895
I don't have to...

08:34.803 --> 08:36.693
But I mean, the first is a great deal.

08:36.794 --> 08:37.899
I mean, yeah.

08:38.322 --> 08:39.971
I'm sorry, I'm jumping away.

08:39.991 --> 08:41.016
No, that's quite all right.

08:41.232 --> 09:05.569
dianoya is how novels get written without dianoya there is no novel it's 25 years i think it should be i think it's probably the biggest news about anything to do with it at this point 25 years ago eddie quill came out and it's never been out of print is that is that something for you to bear i mean is that a weight no

09:05.903 --> 09:08.086
I know we've talked about this before.

09:08.126 --> 09:09.748
You're saying that's my ticket of admission.

09:09.808 --> 09:12.031
Without Eddie Coyle, you've got him talking to me.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.254
Without Eddie Coyle, I'm not teaching at Boston University.

09:15.215 --> 09:22.304
I can say today, and I do say today, Eddie Coyle, my editor said it first, and I think he probably expected me to live in the mouth of my gun there, but I did.

09:22.324 --> 09:22.945
No such thing.

09:23.986 --> 09:28.012
Eddie Coyle is a three-finger exercise compared to what I'm doing now.

09:28.032 --> 09:30.595
But without that dead gangsta, nobody prints my stuff.

09:30.997 --> 09:33.882
That was my key to the mission.

09:33.902 --> 09:38.509
I think you said to me before, with Joe Heller, and I've asked Joe Heller this.

09:39.331 --> 09:39.891
He said 22.

09:39.911 --> 09:41.835
He feels like it was a millstone, I know.

09:42.195 --> 09:46.883
It's also a good excuse for not doing any work.

09:48.746 --> 09:50.529
I led in my Puzo piece.

09:50.569 --> 09:53.173
They were buddies back in the 50s.

09:53.491 --> 09:56.194
I didn't realize... I was that old.

09:56.615 --> 09:58.096
I was in World War II.

09:58.116 --> 09:59.398
I didn't realize I was old.

10:00.519 --> 10:02.321
I flew airplanes in World War II.

10:02.461 --> 10:02.842
I know it.

10:02.982 --> 10:06.065
Now that you say it, of course it has to be.

10:06.166 --> 10:06.866
Let me finish this.

10:06.886 --> 10:16.918
Talk a little bit about... Do you feel, however, that you have to... I mean, if it's actually to try and... Well, I've surpassed any film.

10:16.938 --> 10:23.025
I know, but in terms of perception of the audience, they always... Thankfully, thankfully, they don't say it anymore.

10:23.174 --> 10:26.539
They don't say by the author of the friendship.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.743
But they make it pretty clear that's who I am, and they should.

10:29.044 --> 10:33.531
They should, but at least I'm pleased that they don't put it on the friendship.

10:33.651 --> 10:38.839
Well, there was a story in the Boston Globe about a lawyer of Bingham Data.

10:40.242 --> 10:42.946
I can't remember his last name.

10:42.966 --> 10:45.550
His first name is Sabin, S-A-B-I-N.

10:45.751 --> 10:47.173
And he's published an author.

10:47.744 --> 10:58.400
And the article noted, of course, that he is not the first Boston lawyer to find time to write a novel while practicing law.

10:58.801 --> 11:00.808
And it listed Joan Lukey.

11:02.020 --> 11:26.121
and barry reed carried me and didn't even well was it joe cline that's why i knew he was primary i think it was joe cline i've forgotten now whose name was on but i well i it was in the line in the bank with banks too that's all the analogy i didn't even know he did that much he did that much but anyway he conned me in the foreground and i've never spoken to an answer uh

11:26.455 --> 11:30.299
I know the explanation for my exclusion from the article.

11:30.319 --> 11:33.062
It's probably the same reason for Richard Henry Dana's exclusion.

11:33.542 --> 11:34.503
The kid never heard of us.

11:34.523 --> 11:37.887
He was two when Eddie Coyle came out.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.628
If born, that's the reason.

11:39.648 --> 11:41.250
I was driving in there.

11:41.330 --> 11:42.812
I've got a 15-year-old daughter.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.593
Who are you doing today, Dad?

11:44.654 --> 11:51.180
I said, the friends of Eddie Coyle?

11:51.240 --> 11:52.622
Why should a 15-year-old know that?

11:52.642 --> 11:54.163
I can't think of a single reason.

11:54.504 --> 11:55.905
Unless he watches too much television.

11:56.240 --> 12:02.670
I ran that movie about three times a week, a year ago.

12:03.050 --> 12:14.308
The only thing that's really dogged my career about Eddie Quirrell is the fact that Christopher Landon said I was a prime novelist.

12:14.328 --> 12:17.673
And that was really, he was such an asshole.

12:17.753 --> 12:22.580
He gave me a wonderful review, and he did not eat anything like that.

12:22.660 --> 12:22.961
Did he?

12:22.981 --> 12:23.802
Nobody reviewed it?

12:23.822 --> 12:24.964
None of the daily times.

12:24.944 --> 12:29.402
That's why you don't get a daily life.

12:29.686 --> 12:31.068
You get one or the other now.

12:31.088 --> 12:31.528
Really?

12:31.548 --> 12:34.312
Ever since the woman who just left.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.113
Becky Sinkler.

12:35.453 --> 12:35.874
That's right.

12:36.094 --> 12:38.157
She was the one who put it in the policy.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.119
If you get a review on a Sunday, you don't get it in the daily.

12:40.159 --> 12:40.500
Really?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.361
Oh, okay.

12:41.381 --> 12:42.502
Well, then I don't feel so bad.

12:42.522 --> 12:46.487
No, you get the same evil treatment that everybody else gets.

12:46.587 --> 12:47.929
I should think you would be.

12:47.949 --> 12:49.531
I am, too.

12:49.851 --> 12:50.612
Alan Peaker.

12:50.632 --> 12:55.078
I mean, Alan was... Chris is out of there in his first book.

12:55.318 --> 12:57.761
I've interviewed Chris.

12:57.821 --> 12:59.203
His father is in the book.

12:59.183 --> 13:02.107
I think it's policy.

13:02.187 --> 13:03.269
It's not his doing.

13:03.489 --> 13:04.671
So then I feel better.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.353
I feel better.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.357
Usually you're right when you think somebody's stuck a knife in your back in the publishing.

13:09.617 --> 13:11.520
I've done a lot of stuff.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.342
In gratitude.

13:13.883 --> 13:17.428
Oh.

13:17.408 --> 13:29.521
That's what I say, I'm an old boy, but I do want the 20 bucks.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.863
This is funny.

13:31.963 --> 13:35.146
I'm having so much fun with this thing.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.409
That's the whole idea, but we're not going to make any money.

13:37.429 --> 13:41.453
We might as well have a few laughs.

13:41.473 --> 13:44.496
You know, one of our interviews, and it's a great... Great.

13:44.948 --> 13:51.759
I have a deed that says the city is mine.

13:51.779 --> 13:52.440
Yeah, just about.

13:52.561 --> 13:54.043
These are my words.

13:54.183 --> 13:57.388
Yeah, there have been others who have kind of encroached.

13:57.489 --> 14:00.894
I mean, in Snipernet, he had Bob Parker, he had some war in that.

14:00.914 --> 14:02.918
How do you feel about that?

14:03.038 --> 14:05.562
Yeah, trust me.

14:07.285 --> 14:09.528
Well, and I will put in this piece.

14:09.629 --> 14:11.091
I get to be a Dutch lawyer.

14:11.510 --> 14:14.035
I've asked him, who have you been influenced by?

14:14.055 --> 14:15.357
He's been very generous to me.

14:15.477 --> 14:16.659
And he makes it a point.

14:16.679 --> 14:18.482
He doesn't know I know you or anything like that.

14:18.502 --> 14:21.187
He says, that was a guy right here in Boston.

14:21.207 --> 14:22.790
And he said, very generous.

14:23.031 --> 14:25.535
In fact, I quoted that in a piece.

14:25.575 --> 14:26.657
He said it several times.

14:26.777 --> 14:27.458
I learned from him.

14:27.479 --> 14:28.340
He doesn't learn from me.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.624
We were in Toronto for that Avisar thing.

14:30.644 --> 14:32.027
I think it was in 91.

14:32.147 --> 14:35.593
And when we were old in, we went to the registration center.

14:35.793 --> 14:39.357
And they asked me if there was anybody on the roster I wanted to meet.

14:39.437 --> 14:40.559
And I said, yes, Elmore Leonard.

14:40.579 --> 14:44.804
Because I tried to connect with him when I'd been on tour and going through Detroit.

14:44.824 --> 14:48.288
And he had been in Montgomery, Alabama on tour.

14:49.269 --> 14:51.972
And when he came through Boston, I was in New York or something.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.877
And we just kept missing each other like trips in the night.

14:55.897 --> 14:57.859
And I said, yes, Elmore Leonard.

14:57.879 --> 15:00.062
And the one at the desk said, isn't that interesting?

15:00.082 --> 15:00.603
Well, he asked him.

15:00.623 --> 15:02.305
He said, George Higgins.

15:02.925 --> 15:05.108
Elmore and I, we immediately were

15:05.881 --> 15:07.584
They took us as an entry in a horse race.

15:07.704 --> 15:10.208
One was A and the other was B. We had to go everywhere together.

15:10.529 --> 15:12.913
We worked our asses off.

15:12.933 --> 15:17.020
And Loretta and his then wife went around Toronto having fun.

15:18.623 --> 15:20.647
And then, of course, he'd get rid of the wife.

15:20.667 --> 15:26.697
Loretta said she was a bit quarrelous, though, so I imagine she talked herself out of her job.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.003
You know, I've been criticized for writing this.

15:30.143 --> 15:30.724
I don't.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.202
Don't take it to her.

15:32.262 --> 15:33.104
They love her.

15:33.184 --> 15:36.109
I mean, I do want these signings.

15:36.429 --> 15:38.213
Most people don't know.

15:38.373 --> 15:43.763
I do want it this way, but most people don't know that if they don't have it personalized, it's worth more money.

15:43.783 --> 15:45.987
I have to be the authority, and I disagree.

15:46.087 --> 15:46.848
You do?

15:46.868 --> 15:46.989
Yeah.

15:47.009 --> 15:48.932
Well, that's what I've always been told.

15:48.912 --> 15:55.499
I'm not sure I'm going to continue to say it, because a lot of people mail me books, and I don't feel like writing funny notes down there.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.020
No, no, no.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.885
Actually, what would you rather... Oh, a letter from somebody or an autograph?

16:01.566 --> 16:02.027
A letter.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.449
A letter, because it says something.

16:04.469 --> 16:04.770
Yes, of course.

16:04.870 --> 16:06.492
I have a letter from Graham Green.

16:06.512 --> 16:08.514
Well, that's... What are you thinking?

16:08.554 --> 16:10.957
Would you get more money for the letter or the autograph?

16:10.977 --> 16:15.962
I would get more money for the first letter I had from Graham Green, which was stolen by the framers.

16:16.563 --> 16:18.345
I took it to be framed, and they said,

16:18.325 --> 16:24.589
now we've got no record of it this is also known as an association description yes i know that but i got that from your book already

16:24.755 --> 16:26.016
It goes out of there.

16:26.036 --> 16:26.817
I don't know.

16:26.837 --> 16:28.539
John O'Hara books.

16:28.559 --> 16:30.400
The autographs.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.403
And especially we're on the occasion of a first revoke for each of us.

16:33.423 --> 16:33.984
Oh, really?

16:34.084 --> 16:34.765
What's that?

16:34.785 --> 16:37.988
The interviewer describes a book for the interviewer?

16:38.008 --> 16:38.468
Is this something?

16:38.488 --> 16:41.731
If somebody's going to say a hundred years from now, who has his best brain?

16:41.751 --> 16:47.417
Well, actually, this is his book, so it's kind of, you know, it could make some more valuable.

16:47.437 --> 16:48.838
I'll sell it this afternoon.

16:48.858 --> 16:50.560
You might, yes.

16:50.540 --> 16:58.151
Robert Montgomery Scott was cleaning out the ancestral estate after his mother was trodden to death by her donkeys.

16:58.651 --> 17:05.821
And, among other things, he cleaned out their library, and they had a number of inscribed volumes from John O'Hara.

17:05.841 --> 17:14.193
And one of them has a long personal address in it, and he gave it to me, because of my great admiration for O'Hara's work.

17:14.994 --> 17:19.180
It happens to me now, and I don't admire it very much, but it's O'Hara's story.

17:19.649 --> 17:26.035
You'll do mine at the end.

17:26.116 --> 17:26.756
Yes, I will.

17:26.916 --> 17:34.284
Give me a comment on the lawyers who write.

17:34.544 --> 17:44.074
I mean, you basically pioneered this whole thing.

17:44.094 --> 17:45.776
I didn't though.

17:47.117 --> 17:48.238
I really didn't.

17:48.775 --> 17:51.278
Michael Montaigne was a lawyer.

17:52.279 --> 17:56.984
The number of lawyers who've gone straight as writers is legion.

17:57.104 --> 18:01.168
We used to call ourselves, we still do, the last learned profession.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.951
And there was a time, I think, when that was true.

18:04.392 --> 18:04.992
It isn't now.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.595
Law schools have become cash cows.

18:08.336 --> 18:12.100
When I became a member of the Massachusetts Barrett, I was one of 8,000.

18:12.974 --> 18:14.716
This room, by the way, is full of trowel oils.

18:14.736 --> 18:16.198
That's where I have my Bruce 2 on.

18:16.218 --> 18:17.961
I'm entitled to coloration.

18:18.021 --> 18:19.002
I don't want a shark bite.

18:20.825 --> 18:24.189
I'm entitled to professional courtesy.

18:25.651 --> 18:28.174
Well, I would say this.

18:28.895 --> 18:31.018
And unfortunately, many do.

18:31.078 --> 18:33.041
And you would agree with me?

18:33.061 --> 18:33.762
Oh, yes, I do.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.526
There are now 55,000 lawyers in Massachusetts.

18:36.686 --> 18:42.053
There are 600,000 fewer people in Massachusetts.

18:42.826 --> 18:51.336
So I was listening to a friend of mine complain with good reason about the legal service he had done subjectively for his good money.

18:52.157 --> 19:03.391
And when he got through, I said, now look, citing those figures, 8,000 against 55,000, it stands to reason that when you multiply the members of the profession by seven, you're going to get a large number of assholes.

19:03.411 --> 19:07.416
There's only so many people intelligent available for any line of work.

19:07.736 --> 19:10.740
And we've got too many people at ours, and that means there has to be a lot of jerks.

19:10.990 --> 19:14.458
And they'll do anything.

19:14.478 --> 19:18.268
You don't mind my jumping around?

19:18.348 --> 19:20.232
No, I prefer it.

19:20.333 --> 19:27.249
I always think these things are going to betray me.

19:27.650 --> 19:29.134
They broke down on me and said, will you?

19:29.519 --> 19:32.623
I always usually carry two, and you told me that.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.226
Fortunately, I was taking notes.

19:35.306 --> 19:44.858
Studs Terkel told me that he sees all thumbs, and he told me the interviews he's lost.

19:44.898 --> 19:45.879
He's all bums.

19:46.039 --> 19:49.103
Well, I just quit for no reason at all.

19:49.303 --> 19:53.809
Anyway, do you like the arc of your career?

19:53.829 --> 19:54.750
How many books?

19:55.507 --> 19:56.088
27, 27, 28.

19:56.128 --> 20:00.154
So really it's better than one a year.

20:00.195 --> 20:00.795
Yeah.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.702
There were two years when I did not, well one year really.

20:05.563 --> 20:15.439
Two years when I was unable to drive because I was recovering from an addiction and they tell you that the physiological difficulty of quitting smoking

20:15.908 --> 20:17.070
is hideous, and it was.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.298
That's why I never managed the many other times I tried to stop.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.243
And I had to go to bed.

20:24.263 --> 20:30.995
I had a witness when I was in the table, a prosecutor's office, who was on methadone.

20:31.015 --> 20:33.219
We weren't giving him enough, apparently.

20:33.239 --> 20:34.301
And he went into withdrawal.

20:35.203 --> 20:38.669
And his agony, his physical agony, lasted longer than mine did.

20:38.689 --> 20:39.891
I think he was killed.

20:40.158 --> 20:43.543
in terrible shape for about 10 or 11 days.

20:43.563 --> 20:49.071
I went into, I started getting depressed and agitated and tremulous and irritated.

20:50.233 --> 20:54.019
And the 10th day, I figured that's when you use up the nicotine and your soft tissue.

20:54.039 --> 20:55.161
And I was on the patch.

20:55.401 --> 21:02.812
The patch was giving me approximately 40% of the nicotine I've been accustomed to getting for 15 hours.

21:02.832 --> 21:07.820
And the second day, I was even worse and I was unable to perform sequential reasoning.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.422
And the third day, I had to go to bed.

21:10.077 --> 21:11.618
because I was getting the children.

21:11.679 --> 21:14.841
No question about it, it was withdrawal.

21:15.943 --> 21:18.265
It's a wonderful drug.

21:19.466 --> 21:22.268
And then I got over it, and I got false confidence.

21:22.329 --> 21:27.353
But I had trouble, terrible trouble with sequential reasoning for the next year and a half.

21:27.513 --> 21:28.094
When was this?

21:28.454 --> 21:36.642
I started on March 6 of 92, and I don't think I really regained form until late in the fall of 94.

21:36.993 --> 21:38.997
It was only intermittent.

21:39.077 --> 21:43.926
I was writing during that period, but if I had been writing... You were publishing?

21:44.066 --> 21:45.689
No, I wasn't.

21:45.969 --> 21:52.842
The book that was published had been written before I did that, and then there was a year I missed because I didn't have another one ready to go.

21:52.822 --> 21:56.467
Then when I began... No, no, I'd missed another year.

21:56.588 --> 22:02.997
Choice of Enemies was supposed to come out in 83, but cannot fumble the ball, so it came out in 84.

22:03.317 --> 22:05.861
No, that's the first time that's ever happened to me.

22:05.881 --> 22:16.857
I could have done 90-word stories, a graph and a half, as we used to call it, for the AP, but as far as writing a chapter, or even a short story, I couldn't keep my attention focused on that.

22:17.979 --> 22:19.521
And I was also...

22:20.817 --> 22:23.844
that we dejected, was not mildly depressed.

22:24.687 --> 22:28.255
And that was the hardest part because nobody predicted that for me.

22:28.315 --> 22:29.959
I didn't know I should expect that.

22:30.681 --> 22:35.353
Since then, I think I've been able to be of some assistance to other addicts who have been trying to get out of this.

22:35.373 --> 22:38.320
I think in retrospect, I would have stayed on the patch forever.

22:39.329 --> 22:52.553
I'm just delighted that you're coming down to Columbia.

22:52.574 --> 22:53.295
I really am.

22:54.076 --> 22:57.523
Well, I'm delighted because Rick is... I'm going to write a story about it from this new magazine.

22:57.603 --> 22:58.665
I'm going to write a book.

22:58.685 --> 23:00.268
Biblio, what's it say?

23:00.288 --> 23:00.348
Oh.

23:00.368 --> 23:00.949
And I tell...

23:00.929 --> 23:07.624
I tried to pitch it to Smithsonian and they said that it's a very interesting story.

23:07.644 --> 23:09.449
There's nothing to take pictures of.

23:09.549 --> 23:12.676
I would say try the geographic.

23:12.977 --> 23:13.899
They pay so much.

23:14.039 --> 23:17.547
I want to go to Sally Eagle.

23:18.108 --> 23:20.153
We'll talk about that.

23:20.302 --> 23:24.127
This is kind of the way they put a Jerry Kennedy novel.

23:24.147 --> 23:26.490
I have an insistent upon it.

23:26.510 --> 23:27.451
Let's talk about that.

23:27.471 --> 23:34.279
Well, the reason is that of all the characters that I've written about, and this is from the very first book, it's not because there have been four books about it.

23:34.299 --> 23:39.365
From the very first book, he provoked the most male of any character I've ever written about.

23:39.385 --> 23:42.769
As you might expect, mostly from lawyers and judges.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.853
And most of them imagine that I have somehow

23:46.188 --> 23:51.596
intruded into their dreams and lives, and I know what they're doing, and therefore Jerry Kennedy is based on that.

23:53.218 --> 24:10.322
I would say probably now the total of letters I've gotten, I mean, I don't mean to sound like a bow, of course not, but I bet in the course of 16 years since Kennedy for the Transfers appeared, I've probably gotten about 30 letters from people who are convinced that I've

24:10.555 --> 24:11.957
I've stolen part of their lives.

24:12.077 --> 24:12.638
That's a lot.

24:12.838 --> 24:13.299
Yeah, it is.

24:14.220 --> 24:21.471
When I wrote The Digger's Game, I was prosecuted, when I published The Digger's Game, by then I was prosecuting a big, fat Irish guy who ran a saloon.

24:22.352 --> 24:23.914
I had him on stolen checks.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.637
He was cashing on a construction company.

24:25.677 --> 24:26.178
A lot of money.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.344
His brother was a Jesuit priest, and he was convinced that he was the digger.

24:31.145 --> 24:36.613
And so between the time he pleaded guilty and the time he was going to be sentenced, he brought The Digger's Game and two copies for me to autograph it.

24:37.066 --> 24:41.632
And he was absolutely crestfallen when I told him he was not the victim.

24:41.652 --> 24:43.174
But he wasn't.

24:43.194 --> 24:45.477
So you have to be careful how you let people down.

24:45.677 --> 24:52.866
There was one judge down in Missouri who became fixated on the idea.

24:52.886 --> 24:55.290
He was Jerry Kennedy.

24:55.310 --> 24:57.292
And then the motive began to appear.

24:57.312 --> 24:58.534
It seems he was writing a novel.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.797
And he was having a few problems with it.

25:00.817 --> 25:04.221
And he went and I said, no.

25:04.589 --> 25:06.391
He pronounced himself upset.

25:06.451 --> 25:08.333
This was kind of a protractive correspondence.

25:08.393 --> 25:10.294
How do they figure you know their lives, anyway?

25:10.755 --> 25:12.336
Well, they think that they're so interesting.

25:12.416 --> 25:15.279
It must be where I got all those interesting stories.

25:15.299 --> 25:21.325
I have to say, a way that Bob Parker says, he doesn't know the mail from people who send ideas.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.509
Well, you don't know until you open it, whether it's ideas.

25:25.529 --> 25:26.550
That looks good.

25:26.690 --> 25:27.471
I'd like some of that.

25:27.631 --> 25:28.792
Not the pepper.

25:28.952 --> 25:29.933
All right.

25:30.113 --> 25:33.837
You want that one, sir?

25:34.053 --> 25:39.461
I'd like a salad as well.

25:39.561 --> 25:46.111
Oh, excuse me.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.777
I forgot I was having meat.

25:50.658 --> 25:53.823
It makes a lot of difference.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.626
I'm a purist.

25:55.706 --> 26:02.997
Well, anyway, this judge, the judge said he was milked.

26:04.124 --> 26:10.778
And he thought the least I could do was assist him since we have brothers in the law.

26:12.422 --> 26:19.777
And I wrote back and said that he could console himself by giving out longer sentences and quotes and saying that I wrote them.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.441
And he didn't get it.

26:24.188 --> 26:33.243
Recently, I had a letter from a lawyer in Boston, and he explained that he has always wanted to write novels, and so he'd like two or three hours of my time, and he'll buy the beers.

26:33.303 --> 26:36.087
To get back to Eddie Coyle, you're an old newspaper man.

26:36.107 --> 26:39.513
Do you have any doubts that the lead draft of your own business is going to say?

26:40.534 --> 26:41.596
No, I don't.

26:41.636 --> 26:50.230
We were out sailing one day with my friend Mike Mullen, who was the best tort lawyer in the Northeast, and that's a consensus, not an arrogation.

26:50.564 --> 26:52.529
And he said, I hope we don't fuck him.

26:54.514 --> 27:04.418
Because if we do, the obituary is going to say, noted author died, and I'll have your neighbor the lead, and three paragraphs down, I'll say, trial attorney also drops.

27:04.659 --> 27:06.784
Also missing.

27:06.764 --> 27:13.037
I don't care if they do say that.

27:13.077 --> 27:16.164
Of course, I won't care anyway.

27:16.405 --> 27:26.967
Probably by then they'll say long-time welfare recipient.

27:27.402 --> 27:37.171
You certainly, it goes right to the question of the answer of your career and also the body of work as a corpus.

27:37.191 --> 27:40.073
Do you see it as a chronological thing?

27:40.093 --> 27:45.918
And you also said that, you know, that he was a three-finger exercise compared to the work that you're doing.

27:45.938 --> 27:48.641
Clearly, you, in your mind, do you see it?

27:48.661 --> 27:50.402
I think I've gone beyond that for a long way.

27:50.422 --> 27:52.324
I would agree with that myself.

27:52.564 --> 27:55.587
I think your narrative is...

27:55.567 --> 28:05.061
Well, I allow myself more, but I still... I still try to keep out of the book as much as I can.

28:05.121 --> 28:06.883
I don't think the author belongs in the story.

28:06.903 --> 28:08.746
Henry James agrees with me.

28:08.766 --> 28:12.531
Milan Kundera doesn't.

28:12.812 --> 28:14.254
I'm with Henry on this one.

28:14.334 --> 28:17.638
Ian Forster agrees with me.

28:17.658 --> 28:22.946
I think we've got a quorum.

28:23.006 --> 28:23.667
I don't like...

28:24.912 --> 28:28.376
Interventionism by the author, one thing is so easy.

28:29.438 --> 28:39.009
You exonerate yourself from trying to achieve the willing suspension of disbelief by saying, I'm just going to put my foot in this thing anytime I choose.

28:40.731 --> 28:44.376
I say as a reader, if you dare me to finish your book, I won't.

28:45.297 --> 28:46.018
That's my deal.

28:46.519 --> 28:47.860
You keep your claws off these people.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.343
If these characters are real, they don't need any help from you.

28:51.304 --> 28:53.367
And if they do need help from you, I'm not going to read about it.

28:55.034 --> 29:05.932
So, within limitations, I am allowing myself now more narrative freedom, telling rather than showing.

29:05.952 --> 29:11.181
But by and large, the Kennedy book's an exception because I've adopted an alter ego now.

29:11.261 --> 29:13.465
Anything he says goes.

29:13.867 --> 29:21.498
By and large, now I am, I'd say starting with Choice of Enemies, that's when the greater complexity really began to multiply.

29:21.638 --> 29:28.789
Choice of Enemies is a very complicated book, and I remain to this day extremely disappointed by the reception that it didn't get.

29:28.849 --> 29:32.795
Yeah, it was based on the life of John Forrest Thompson.

29:32.875 --> 29:37.221
It's the only one of my novels I ever faced on a formerly living character.

29:37.241 --> 29:41.848
I was really proud of him, and it was given to that fool, Peter Anderson.

29:42.993 --> 29:49.172
the new york times and he panned it right including milk i never got a handle on the story

29:49.523 --> 29:52.288
What the hell are you doing reviewing it then?

29:52.308 --> 29:52.889
He wrote you a book?

29:53.249 --> 29:54.251
No, it was in the review.

29:55.132 --> 29:59.019
That was a good book, wasn't it?

29:59.079 --> 30:01.523
That was the one set right here in Boston.

30:01.543 --> 30:03.226
It was set in the State House.

30:03.266 --> 30:04.648
The State House.

30:04.668 --> 30:06.651
The State House in western Massachusetts.

30:06.672 --> 30:07.753
That was a nice book.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.136
It was a wonderful book.

30:09.156 --> 30:10.919
That all should have been amazing.

30:10.939 --> 30:14.805
It should have been a full-time surprise winner.

30:14.785 --> 30:20.458
Alison Lurie got it that year for a novel about an academic level for you.

30:20.498 --> 30:22.723
I've met Alison Lurie.

30:22.743 --> 30:31.562
Alison Lurie was on the board with John Irvin was denied that.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.164
It was.

30:33.184 --> 30:36.346
You got it exactly right.

30:37.207 --> 30:40.370
It certainly wasn't.

30:40.470 --> 30:43.373
It certainly wasn't.

30:43.393 --> 30:44.814
God was inspired.

30:45.055 --> 30:49.599
God was inspired, but they would never forgive him for those Ellen James and his son.

30:50.119 --> 30:51.861
But that was true.

30:51.881 --> 30:55.584
It was Mary Lee Semmel and Alison Lurie and Wallace Stegner.

30:55.604 --> 30:56.926
That was the board.

30:56.946 --> 31:00.469
You know, Wallace Stegner.

31:00.449 --> 31:06.397
But not to deny, John, I have no trouble believing that the film change existed.

31:06.437 --> 31:07.319
That's a fact.

31:07.339 --> 31:09.121
And she did cut out her tongue.

31:09.782 --> 31:10.703
Did everybody else?

31:10.723 --> 31:12.726
But of course, in the book, they all followed her.

31:12.866 --> 31:14.088
Some did.

31:14.108 --> 31:17.132
There were some followers who did the same thing.

31:17.192 --> 31:17.693
He did not.

31:17.713 --> 31:18.154
He made it.

31:18.174 --> 31:19.215
Exaggerated it.

31:19.235 --> 31:21.939
That was satire.

31:21.979 --> 31:22.900
That was sacrilege.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.342
Of the most wonderful kind.

31:24.723 --> 31:26.265
Because they saw themselves in this.

31:26.325 --> 31:26.946
Of course.

31:26.926 --> 31:35.985
Alison Lurie was in that Office USA show written 20 best novels by Americans published in Great Britain's and World Order.

31:36.005 --> 31:36.726
I was on that tour.

31:36.746 --> 31:38.149
It was great and fun.

31:38.209 --> 31:41.195
It was well-ordered.

31:41.235 --> 31:43.500
She got the Pulitzer then.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.161
I'm 84.

31:44.241 --> 31:46.204
What the hell is the question, bro?

31:46.224 --> 31:48.828
It's always about an academic, poor little girl.

31:48.988 --> 31:50.651
The love triangle on campus.

31:50.671 --> 31:51.452
Who's he teaching?

31:51.472 --> 31:53.395
Colgate or Cornell?

31:53.495 --> 31:57.642
One of the things.

31:57.662 --> 31:59.845
But then they're going to come to Cornell.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.067
They're going to go to Cornell.

32:01.047 --> 32:16.103
It's boring.

32:16.083 --> 32:39.306
It is, it is nimble, but the trouble is I began to think that she is

32:39.286 --> 32:42.992
putting on a freak show for the, the light of the room.

32:43.112 --> 32:46.538
Where does she meet all these grotesques in the light she leaves?

32:46.618 --> 32:49.603
And she's pooped out the boat, she never leaves the house.

32:50.004 --> 32:57.316
Yeah, and why, another thing that did it to me too, when did she come out bragging on her book jackets that she graduated from, what was it, Duke or North Carolina?

32:57.616 --> 33:00.120
She was 12 years old or something.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.222
Who gives a chance?

33:01.282 --> 33:02.765
She married an Indian psychiatrist or something.

33:02.865 --> 33:02.965
Yeah.

33:03.451 --> 33:07.415
And she's living a beamer life down in Baltimore, sheltered as can be.

33:08.697 --> 33:11.440
And she's, actually, she's with a touring freak show.

33:12.221 --> 33:21.631
The one that I've gone back to, and I change my reading list to be about every year or so, so I won't get bored.

33:21.671 --> 33:27.378
What I've decided to do, I've excluded the plenary economy, is because of that damned orthographic dial.

33:27.418 --> 33:29.560
She just goes into it with too much.

33:30.063 --> 33:36.234
You can only do so much of that stuff, and sometimes I'm afraid I've overdone it by using IDNIT once.

33:37.196 --> 33:44.448
But I've decided, if I say you can use the collective stories of Klan O'Connor after page 120, I'll be all right.

33:44.468 --> 33:46.953
Because after that, she seemed to come to her senses.

33:47.033 --> 33:48.535
And I like her as well.

33:48.555 --> 33:51.160
She was ahead of her time.

33:51.140 --> 33:58.908
What the British call bloody mind.

33:58.988 --> 34:01.290
Hey, where the hell are we going?

34:02.372 --> 34:06.516
I got a friend with a statement.

34:07.517 --> 34:11.441
You may not get an article out of it.

34:13.583 --> 34:18.328
That's going too far.

34:19.810 --> 34:32.114
I said a long time ago that when I was in my 20s, I realized I'd never get a book published.

34:32.134 --> 34:40.350
It was about then I had, I don't know, I wrote 14 before I was 12, but probably I had eight or nine rejected several times each, not both sides of the Atlantic.

34:41.174 --> 34:45.118
And I can now say, and rightly so, because they weren't very good.

34:45.799 --> 34:47.141
I thought that was your print as well.

34:47.161 --> 34:47.581
Yes, it was.

34:47.601 --> 34:52.387
And I'm grateful now that they weren't published, because they weren't any good.

34:52.407 --> 34:54.529
They were stupid and they were good.

34:54.569 --> 35:00.195
But now, I also... But you know, like John Grisham, who just dropped these things after success.

35:00.416 --> 35:01.997
I saw mine in the dump.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.479
You know how they've taken these books?

35:03.499 --> 35:05.241
Yeah, but I saw mine in the dump.

35:05.407 --> 35:11.453
When I got Eddie Coyle accepted, I took all my own manuscripts and threw them in the dump, and I watched them, and they said, here's where we begin.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.696
And I watched the bull bulls, and it's falling under.

35:13.716 --> 35:14.737
I really did that.

35:14.757 --> 35:16.739
That's not absolute truth.

35:17.079 --> 35:22.525
I had manuscripts in my house in Hingham, where I was living with my first wife, and I had manuscripts where it would grown up.

35:23.846 --> 35:24.887
And I tracked them all down.

35:24.947 --> 35:27.891
I think I got them all.

35:27.951 --> 35:34.097
And I threw them in the Rockland dump, and as it happened, the bull bulls that came to prowl over the road, that

35:34.499 --> 35:36.923
at the same time while I was there, and I watched them plowed under.

35:36.943 --> 35:38.126
No, I'm not going to recycle them.

35:38.246 --> 35:39.608
They don't exist.

35:40.049 --> 35:44.637
What do you think of these authors without naming names like British?

35:44.697 --> 35:46.020
I suppose I would do it.

35:47.803 --> 35:48.264
I don't know.

35:48.284 --> 35:54.595
I don't have the temptation because I removed the means to succumb to it.

35:54.615 --> 35:58.262
And I did it deliberately because I realized that when

35:59.221 --> 36:03.235
I finally got any quote accepted that I had been in that apprenticeship.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.182
I had learned how to write.

36:05.222 --> 36:08.132
And that's hard to do.

36:08.193 --> 36:09.758
It's one of the hardest things we ever do.

36:09.778 --> 36:10.581
We're born with

36:11.489 --> 36:13.371
There is no innate talent for writing.

36:13.391 --> 36:17.856
There are no Mozarts among writers, and I know of.

36:18.116 --> 36:21.079
You have to learn the language from infancy.

36:21.099 --> 36:23.061
You have to learn sequential reasoning.

36:24.062 --> 36:25.784
And you have to learn some stories.

36:26.225 --> 36:31.150
And what your high school teachers tell you, write about yourself, write about what you know.

36:31.911 --> 36:33.773
It's boring shit.

36:33.793 --> 36:35.835
You've got to learn some stories that are interesting.

36:36.335 --> 36:38.037
And then you've got to learn a way to tell them.

36:38.658 --> 36:41.342
Develop a style, in other words, with the language that you use.

36:41.562 --> 36:43.365
And it takes a long time.

36:43.385 --> 36:45.508
Nobody cares about your personal problems.

36:46.009 --> 36:48.893
That's why I didn't want to talk about random house and my own shit.

36:48.913 --> 36:50.595
Well, that's why I tell my kids.

36:50.896 --> 36:53.960
A lot of guys out here are really hungry.

36:54.280 --> 37:03.113
What I tell my students is, do not believe that you are the first person who ever discovered what's in your pants and what you can do with it.

37:05.118 --> 37:08.935
I'm not interested in reading about it.

37:09.792 --> 37:15.921
And you should also tell the students, I'm sure you do.

37:15.941 --> 37:19.186
But you're paid to read what they write.

37:19.206 --> 37:20.748
I think very well, too.

37:20.848 --> 37:23.091
And I hope very well.

37:23.252 --> 37:23.752
I am.

37:23.832 --> 37:27.858
People out there, when you're writing for publication, they don't like it.

37:27.878 --> 37:28.920
They don't like it.

37:28.940 --> 37:29.421
They're gone.

37:29.441 --> 37:30.622
They're out of there.

37:30.642 --> 37:32.084
That's why I do tell the kids.

37:32.805 --> 37:34.368
I completely have mad on the course.

37:35.189 --> 37:37.993
First of all, you've got to read aloud from stuff on my list.

37:38.783 --> 37:44.349
Make a selection, read aloud for 20 minutes, and discuss why, and then we all discuss why this works and why it didn't.

37:44.369 --> 37:46.892
One of my favorites is Gage Elyse's name and it's jury.

37:46.952 --> 37:48.213
Any selection out of that book.

37:48.954 --> 37:49.575
Very useful.

37:49.655 --> 37:50.896
It's a best book.

37:50.916 --> 37:51.577
I think that's right.

37:51.637 --> 37:55.301
To go Honour Thy Father is very good.

37:55.321 --> 37:57.103
Honour Thy Father is the banana book.

37:57.143 --> 37:58.224
The banana book.

37:58.244 --> 38:00.507
That came after the New York Times book.

38:00.527 --> 38:05.112
But it was, uh... But the one we was going all the way to was... I mean, I think it was... Don Aide's wife.

38:05.969 --> 38:09.334
Yeah, and Nan didn't appreciate the fact that he was doing all that field work.

38:09.434 --> 38:12.138
I interviewed them together on that book.

38:12.639 --> 38:13.600
She was the focus.

38:13.701 --> 38:15.463
You had a Kevlar vest on there, Sue.

38:15.483 --> 38:16.765
Well, she'd be taught in the crowd.

38:16.785 --> 38:18.247
She loved the peace.

38:18.267 --> 38:18.488
Oh, man.

38:18.508 --> 38:20.210
And in fact, she became a friend.

38:20.591 --> 38:22.033
She seems like a very nice woman.

38:22.073 --> 38:23.315
I've only known her from Tara's father.

38:23.455 --> 38:27.561
She is, but she's, and this is, I'm going to put this off on the phone.

38:27.621 --> 38:28.382
No, that's quite all right.

38:28.442 --> 38:31.487
I just thought you were finished, but you thought it was on.

38:31.467 --> 38:41.446
It's four Jerry Kennedys over 16 years, right?

38:41.646 --> 38:42.909
I never know when he's going to report.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.612
The Olympics, I mean, does he check in?

38:44.632 --> 38:45.834
Yeah, but it's irregular though.

38:45.954 --> 38:48.379
It's 1980, 1985.

38:49.996 --> 38:51.098
Well, is he your rabbit?

38:51.399 --> 38:53.162
Oh, yeah.

38:53.182 --> 38:54.785
Yes, and that's overt.

38:54.845 --> 38:55.607
That's intentional.

38:55.627 --> 38:58.633
That's exactly what I intended to do with it.

38:58.793 --> 39:00.557
I don't know what he'll report again.

39:00.697 --> 39:02.861
That, like all my stories, they occur to me.

39:02.961 --> 39:04.003
I can't make them occur.

39:04.043 --> 39:05.406
When I try to force a story,

39:05.723 --> 39:08.566
130 pages get done and then it goes in the attic.

39:08.586 --> 39:11.729
I can't write it because the characters never come alive.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.031
I just dumped a short story.

39:13.391 --> 39:23.742
I could not get interested in this story of a young woman who didn't want to go to college and just wanted a job that would enable her to buy a cheap charity.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.886
Her father's a cop and blah, blah, blah.

39:28.026 --> 39:30.128
And she goes to work for a phone telemarketer.

39:30.148 --> 39:31.650
And I say, you know, nobody's going to read this.

39:31.790 --> 39:32.971
I don't even want to write it.

39:32.991 --> 39:35.494
And that's a clear indication nobody's going to want to read it.

39:35.963 --> 39:37.527
And I said, no.

39:37.547 --> 39:43.183
I've written four short stories recently, which I find frightening, because I hadn't written a short story since 1988.

39:43.223 --> 39:46.412
I think it's because that's when I started teaching.

39:47.236 --> 39:55.971
The time between novels that I formally devoted to writing short stories, I have since been devoting to polishing my act of teaching.

39:55.991 --> 39:58.976
And therefore to come back to it is somewhat reassuring.

39:59.177 --> 40:04.947
Apparently now I think I've gotten enough of a handle on the teaching so I can spend some time writing short stories.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.409
But it's always there very long.

40:06.389 --> 40:08.052
The shortest one is 5,000 words.

40:08.272 --> 40:09.294
I can't get them accepted.

40:09.615 --> 40:12.720
Does teaching help you in your own writing?

40:12.800 --> 40:14.143
Indirectly?

40:14.423 --> 40:16.166
No, no.

40:16.407 --> 40:19.312
It helps me indirectly by giving me an outlet.

40:19.492 --> 40:25.984
Thank you.

40:25.964 --> 40:54.385
they've gone to the they've lost the crust of plates though initially i objected to that then i decided change is enough please all of it i've often considered saying we never mind the steak and stuff we need a sauce of course uh

40:54.618 --> 40:58.322
The teaching helps me because it gives me an outlet.

40:58.342 --> 41:04.929
I spent one summer when I had consecutive deadlines within a month.

41:06.931 --> 41:07.691
Thank you.

41:07.711 --> 41:09.693
Yeah, the capers.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.277
And I got agoraphobic.

41:13.297 --> 41:14.198
I didn't get in here.

41:14.879 --> 41:16.440
This was between boats.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.764
And I was working like a bastard.

41:20.344 --> 41:23.608
And I got so I didn't want to go out at all.

41:23.628 --> 41:23.848
I didn't.

41:24.098 --> 41:26.483
Not that far away.

41:26.503 --> 41:34.458
I don't want that to happen again, and I dearly miss the trial course.

41:34.478 --> 41:36.241
I miss what it was at the trial course.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.726
You miss it terribly.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.690
Less so, less so since I've tried to keep it.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.122
I mean, so why did you read the thing?

41:43.983 --> 41:50.330
Because my learned brothers in the Boston bar put it out that I quit practicing water right full time.

41:50.390 --> 41:53.794
And I had a lot of competition to try cases.

41:54.695 --> 41:57.998
And when that kind of practice on the street that you cook, you have.

41:58.719 --> 41:59.800
But you don't get cases.

41:59.880 --> 42:03.985
It was costing me $65,000 a year to run a very modest operation.

42:04.225 --> 42:05.907
And I wasn't making it back in legal.

42:05.967 --> 42:09.211
I wasn't breaking even.

42:09.731 --> 42:10.592
So what I had done,

42:10.977 --> 42:27.438
kept on with, to buffer the vicissitudes of the writing life and its ups and downs, is in fact exhausting the income that I was making from the writing life.

42:27.939 --> 42:34.488
You said when you were a kid and you were convinced that you would never be public.

42:34.508 --> 42:36.710
Was there ever a moment, I mean, like, is any quote on the last one?

42:36.730 --> 42:39.694
Or do you think you're still going to be writing today, even at that time?

42:39.714 --> 42:40.275
I know I would be.

42:40.593 --> 42:41.334
You would be.

42:41.354 --> 42:43.999
Yes, it's an obsession.

42:44.119 --> 42:51.132
I also knew, and I knew I wouldn't be published, that if I ever was published, they'd never shut me up.

42:51.152 --> 42:52.534
I think I'd be good on that.

42:56.121 --> 42:58.445
So when you were a kid growing up, what was the dream?

42:58.465 --> 43:01.470
To be a trial lawyer?

43:01.687 --> 43:05.032
ever think of being a lawyer when I was growing up.

43:05.053 --> 43:07.136
My father had me convinced I was going to be a medical doctor.

43:07.156 --> 43:08.298
Good news for the sick people.

43:08.378 --> 43:16.852
I was going to fuck organic chemistry and knew it and got out of it before they could want me.

43:16.872 --> 43:26.648
Then I was going to be an English teacher in college, which would give me a salary I could write, used to write on.

43:27.370 --> 43:34.240
I was going to get a PhD at Stanford.

43:34.300 --> 43:35.321
I hated the place.

43:37.885 --> 43:40.028
And they weren't sorry to see me leave.

43:40.048 --> 43:41.350
You actually went out there?

43:41.370 --> 43:42.411
I spent a year there.

43:42.471 --> 43:44.214
I got my MA there.

43:44.234 --> 43:47.418
Oh, you did?

43:47.499 --> 43:47.639
Yes.

43:47.659 --> 43:49.241
American what?

43:49.281 --> 43:49.902
Yes, I know that.

43:51.113 --> 43:57.842
When I got out of Stanford, I was 4F because of the bleeding ulcer I developed at Stanford.

43:57.862 --> 44:00.566
I showed you how much I liked the place.

44:01.447 --> 44:05.693
And so I didn't have to go to Vietnam, and that gave me a certain amount of freedom.

44:05.713 --> 44:09.399
And I couldn't get a job.

44:10.360 --> 44:13.164
What the hell do you do with a degree in English?

44:13.224 --> 44:13.965
Two degrees in English.

44:15.532 --> 44:17.875
J. Walter Thompson wouldn't take me.

44:17.895 --> 44:20.238
The USIA wasn't interested.

44:20.278 --> 44:21.600
The CIA wasn't interested.

44:21.620 --> 44:22.882
I had no real language still.

44:23.122 --> 44:29.351
If my father was going to get me teaching English, I know I've gone over this way.

44:30.833 --> 44:34.177
And in horror, this was to be at Avon High School.

44:34.197 --> 44:36.100
The principal over there was a portrait.

44:38.183 --> 44:41.387
In horror, I got myself my own.

44:41.407 --> 44:44.391
He didn't want me to work in a Coca-Cola, which is what I was doing then.

44:47.611 --> 44:49.775
They wanted me to join their management program.

44:49.795 --> 44:56.868
I often wonder what would have happened if I had gone to Atlanta.

44:56.888 --> 45:00.315
I probably would have gotten fired.

45:00.335 --> 45:02.318
I was an even mouthier kid than I am an adult.

45:02.659 --> 45:09.231
So I went to work in a newspaper business.

45:09.920 --> 45:14.327
And it was from the Providence Journal to the Associated Press in Springfield.

45:14.347 --> 45:17.152
That's where I started watching the trials, because that was the big story.

45:17.252 --> 45:20.397
And that's when I decided I wanted to be a trial lawyer.

45:20.417 --> 45:22.300
But I was writing all the time.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.742
The writing came first.

45:23.762 --> 45:24.183
Always did.

45:24.203 --> 45:25.205
I started when I was 15.

45:27.669 --> 45:30.073
So you're really doing what you've always wanted to do.

45:30.213 --> 45:33.739
I think I'm doing, this sounds awfully pretentious.

45:34.199 --> 45:37.024
You probably shouldn't use it, but I really do think this is it.

45:37.308 --> 45:43.738
I think I'm doing what I was put here to do.

45:43.999 --> 45:49.708
I don't know if it's particularly important, but it is what I was put here to do.

45:49.728 --> 45:52.893
I was a good trial lawyer, I think, every trial lawyer.

45:52.913 --> 45:56.098
I couldn't try cases if I didn't.

45:56.118 --> 46:00.325
But there are lots of good trial lawyers.

46:00.345 --> 46:02.809
And I was a pretty good reporter.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.224
and there are lots of good reporters.

46:06.125 --> 46:20.222
But I think whatever small thing that I do that's in the picture, I don't think there's anybody who can do it better than that.

46:20.242 --> 46:20.502
Not nowadays.

46:20.522 --> 46:24.407
And that, too, is an example of a writerly humor.

46:24.427 --> 46:29.974
You have to have a certain amount of, I suppose, ego.

46:31.055 --> 46:32.897
Because it's an ego-battering job.

46:33.856 --> 46:36.402
I got a story back from GQ today.

46:36.422 --> 46:38.205
It's too long.

46:38.225 --> 46:41.513
That's the problem with these new stories.

46:41.533 --> 46:46.283
Informing me that they no longer accept unsolicited manuscripts.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.345
George Higgins.

46:47.365 --> 46:50.372
Well, I don't think the woman who wrote in Galera ever heard of him.

46:50.392 --> 46:53.158
The guy who used to solicit stories from me is God.

46:53.178 --> 46:54.160
He's an escort.

46:55.844 --> 46:59.289
And he's not dealing with it.

46:59.349 --> 47:03.855
But I'm setting an awful obstacle for myself because the story's 11,000 words.

47:04.156 --> 47:05.037
That's a huge story.

47:05.137 --> 47:05.978
It is.

47:06.459 --> 47:07.700
But I can't tell it any shorter.

47:07.721 --> 47:10.224
That's how long it takes for this character to reveal himself.

47:11.005 --> 47:13.088
He doesn't know he's doing it.

47:14.210 --> 47:19.317
At 11,000 words, that could almost be part of my novel.

47:19.337 --> 47:23.202
What I have in mind to do is follow next year's novel, which is The Canterbury Tale.

47:24.548 --> 47:26.090
What's the title of it?

47:26.110 --> 47:26.872
Canterbury Tale.

47:27.252 --> 47:33.362
I was going to use, it's set in Western Massachusetts, the pioneer valley.

47:33.522 --> 47:38.009
I was going to use Carter, which I, I mean, you said it's a Canterbury Tale.

47:38.029 --> 47:39.832
I thought it was a Canterbury Tale.

47:39.852 --> 47:40.152
It is.

47:40.172 --> 47:41.775
The name of the town is Canterbury.

47:41.955 --> 47:43.678
But I didn't realize that that was the title.

47:43.698 --> 47:44.699
I thought it was a tale.

47:45.020 --> 47:46.102
Well, that's the name of it.

47:46.122 --> 47:47.063
It had other titles.

47:47.515 --> 47:56.312
But each time that my editor and I have referred to it as one of the Canterbury tale, we just decided to kind of give in because that's what the readers are going to do.

47:56.332 --> 47:57.214
That's a great title.

47:57.314 --> 47:58.015
And it stands.

47:58.035 --> 48:07.093
I was going to use, as the locust of this town, as the name for this town, Cardiff, because I've used it before in Gary Kennedy novels, the Cardiff Depot.

48:08.002 --> 48:11.267
I used it in Choice of Enemies.

48:11.588 --> 48:18.939
It's a Massachusetts department of public workplace where all the equipment was stored in Western Massachusetts, and there was much thievery accomplished there.

48:18.959 --> 48:30.216
The trouble is, I've made so many references to Cardiff that it would take me about a month and a half to catalog them all so I don't contradict myself with a new one, and I decide the sensible thing to do is change the name of this town.

48:30.236 --> 48:31.258
Now, what am I going to do at this?

48:31.728 --> 48:33.133
And I thought, why not Canterbury?

48:33.153 --> 48:34.056
It's one of the answers.

48:34.156 --> 48:37.448
All towns in my work are named for towns in England.

48:37.468 --> 48:40.438
Guess where I got that idea?

48:42.038 --> 48:43.400
Anyway, that's the way it came out.

48:43.420 --> 48:44.962
And it's a long, long book.

48:45.123 --> 48:47.827
It came out and dressed up to 249,000 words.

48:48.107 --> 48:49.589
Jesus Christ.

48:49.609 --> 48:52.574
Well, it's got to be... It's bigger than my book.

48:52.634 --> 48:54.577
It's got to be... So I can tell you it is.

48:54.597 --> 48:55.157
I'm sure it is.

48:55.238 --> 48:56.199
It's too big.

48:56.219 --> 49:00.585
I cut it a lot before I... No, it isn't.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.228
We're going to bring that thing in under 500.

49:02.328 --> 49:07.776
But it's... What I said earlier, I'm doing it...

49:08.161 --> 49:12.207
to a lesson degree in Jerry Kennedy and Sandra Nichols.

49:12.287 --> 49:16.333
I shouldn't be talking about next year's book.

49:16.353 --> 49:21.680
No, but actually it sounds like it's pretty ambitious.

49:23.623 --> 49:23.743
It is.

49:23.763 --> 49:29.612
If I were cataloging my own stuff, this would be one of the big ones.

49:30.353 --> 49:30.954
Sandra isn't.

49:32.115 --> 49:33.738
Sandra's a very nice book.

49:34.339 --> 49:35.400
It has a happy ending.

49:37.405 --> 49:50.301
it's uh jerry is happy again for the first time in any of these books really since the first one i think that's why the reviewers and uh publishers weekly and everybody has liked the book because it's sort of nice that's the only word

49:52.542 --> 49:55.826
Except, of course, the discovery of the body of the garbage bag.

49:55.846 --> 49:58.128
That's another cause.

49:58.148 --> 49:58.449
But it happens.

49:58.469 --> 50:04.055
But this is, well, it's a good story.

50:04.175 --> 50:05.797
That's what I try to write every time.

50:05.817 --> 50:11.363
But now and then I attempt something more on the epic, a saga nature.

50:11.383 --> 50:14.226
Enemies was the first one.

50:14.246 --> 50:14.747
Outlaws.

50:16.429 --> 50:17.570
Imposters.

50:18.671 --> 50:22.195
And what one of my aficionados,

50:22.630 --> 50:26.174
He was fairly well informed.

50:26.435 --> 50:31.961
He says it's going to be known as my signature book, Palmer's Law.

50:32.101 --> 50:33.163
I don't know where that came from.

50:33.703 --> 50:36.527
Does that excite you, that prospect?

50:36.627 --> 50:37.688
Yeah.

50:38.409 --> 50:40.611
That's when I really push it.

50:40.631 --> 50:48.621
When I get one of these big ones where I'm wrestling with huge thieves,

50:49.681 --> 50:52.125
It excites me.

50:52.966 --> 50:56.772
It's fun to write Sandra Nichols' books.

50:56.872 --> 51:00.558
It's fun to read them, they're easy to do.

51:00.578 --> 51:01.860
Because they are, it's okay.

51:03.302 --> 51:08.490
But then you start tangling with something like this one.

51:08.510 --> 51:16.583
The second lead character in Canterbury Tale, you notice a certain similarity between his life and his downfall.

51:17.035 --> 51:18.857
and that of Charlie Clarity.

51:18.937 --> 51:27.427
This will be the second time I got a little mining out of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

51:27.447 --> 51:31.232
Is this a book you have to be where you are in life in your 50s to write?

51:31.252 --> 51:31.492
Yes.

51:32.854 --> 51:37.359
I had the story of John Thompson when I was 24 years old, 23.

51:37.700 --> 51:42.926
Because I interviewed him for the Providence Journal.

51:43.146 --> 51:43.887
And I knew...

51:45.402 --> 51:48.324
when I did it.

51:48.344 --> 51:56.692
But I had my Dewey Long.

51:56.712 --> 51:59.314
And this was why I knew it.

51:59.334 --> 52:01.936
And I also knew I couldn't tell it.

52:01.956 --> 52:13.906
And I didn't write that book until 1984, so that was, what, 12, 14 years later.

52:13.926 --> 52:14.867
Do you have a sense of who your reader is?

52:14.887 --> 52:14.987
Yeah.

52:15.305 --> 52:31.577
Unfortunately, he's not too numerous.

52:31.597 --> 52:32.298
He's a white male.

52:32.318 --> 52:35.845
By now, he's... may very well be a...

52:36.044 --> 52:39.610
Yeah, early retirement.

52:39.630 --> 52:42.896
It's probably been fairly successful.

52:43.177 --> 52:46.583
Kind of a prick.

52:47.544 --> 52:51.592
Not really cranky, demanding.

52:51.772 --> 52:52.633
Rigorous.

52:54.797 --> 52:59.706
I've gotten a number of letters from retired Marine officers.

53:01.627 --> 53:02.949
It does not surprise me.

53:03.029 --> 53:04.532
I was never a Marine.

53:04.712 --> 53:11.645
But I've known a good number from the state police.

53:11.705 --> 53:18.777
And they colored my thinking so it doesn't surprise me that other Marines find it resonant.

53:18.797 --> 53:22.183
Unfortunately, 70% of the people who buy books

53:22.332 --> 53:25.619
are women.

53:25.639 --> 53:34.156
So the best chance I have of selling books is to bring them out around Father's Day at Christmas.

53:34.176 --> 53:38.464
Because these guys don't go to bookstores in general rule.

53:38.645 --> 53:41.370
That's all you're going to get there.

53:42.211 --> 53:47.941
Is there any way to combat that, or did you just stay the hell with it?

53:47.961 --> 53:50.144
I've been trying to combat it now for 25 years.

53:50.244 --> 53:53.710
I haven't figured out a way yet.

53:54.171 --> 53:56.194
If you think of it, let me know, will you?

53:56.214 --> 53:56.275
No.

53:56.395 --> 53:58.218
I think there's any number of that.

53:58.258 --> 54:05.710
The list of... I can't just say even the problems were testimonials to your work.

54:05.891 --> 54:08.455
But really, these are not...

54:10.257 --> 54:11.859
It's a significant name.

54:11.899 --> 54:16.344
This ain't beanbag as Tip O'Neill said.

54:16.364 --> 54:19.888
And I think those comments are sincere.

54:19.908 --> 54:22.411
And if they aren't, I prefer to believe that.

54:22.431 --> 54:26.977
What I'm saying is you have an unqualified admiration and respect of your peers.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.579
Yeah, writer's writer.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.081
Unfortunately, writers don't buy many books.

54:30.201 --> 54:31.302
At least they don't seem to.

54:31.422 --> 54:33.545
We're all trying to get copies.

54:33.565 --> 54:35.387
But we get an autumn set to it.

54:35.407 --> 54:38.931
Partly enough, though, very seldom of my set of books.

54:39.164 --> 54:41.108
that I would really like to read.

54:41.649 --> 54:45.496
The only exception I can think of recently is another guy.

54:46.598 --> 54:50.987
Persistent obscurity, if that's a possible combination.

54:51.969 --> 54:54.253
Charles McCary.

54:54.487 --> 55:23.397
I don't know about that I missed that one if you get it the ones that got caught my attention with the tears of autumn and the Mernic dossier and the last supper that's right there was a quartet of books about the war in Vietnam despite all

55:23.917 --> 55:26.362
Can't be his last name either.

55:27.024 --> 55:28.988
Well, he wrote a book that came out a year ago.

55:29.609 --> 55:33.458
Shelly's Heart.

55:34.280 --> 55:36.063
An extraordinary piece of it.

55:36.144 --> 55:37.246
I have a credit card.

55:37.567 --> 55:39.090
Well, you're in for a treat.

55:39.290 --> 55:43.514
Probably reading books is not your idea of a treat because that's what you do for a living.

55:43.534 --> 55:44.555
It's like being a restaurant.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.998
How the hell do you want to go out to dinner?

55:47.298 --> 55:50.321
That's why I gave up reviewing television.

55:51.182 --> 55:52.764
That's why I gave up reviewing television.

55:52.784 --> 55:55.287
That in effect is what a damn little good television to do.

55:56.067 --> 55:59.851
And what was the point of sitting there and belaboring the bad stuff?

55:59.871 --> 56:01.713
But why isn't Charles McCary more popular?

56:01.733 --> 56:02.935
He's a splendid writer.

56:03.876 --> 56:05.417
He's a former CIA.

56:05.437 --> 56:07.079
He never got to college.

56:07.119 --> 56:08.200
He's an autodidact.

56:09.175 --> 56:19.108
He's obviously steeped in the law, as we say, as they generally say about David Cornwall, and yet nobody buys his books.

56:19.128 --> 56:21.210
He's allotera, without any questions.

56:21.230 --> 56:23.453
I think we should point out that that's glad you're afraid.

56:23.473 --> 56:25.196
It's not a question of global advising.

56:25.216 --> 56:34.187
Look, John Fuger, I was enraged to see Joe Klein saying, if this book had sold 50,000 copies, his books routinely do, no one would have cared.

56:34.167 --> 56:36.690
Well, I don't sell routinely 50,000 copies.

56:36.710 --> 56:37.651
I don't even come close.

56:37.671 --> 56:40.954
The most I would go see was 36,000, about.

56:41.014 --> 56:46.480
You know, we've got to the point now, next to the line, if you print this instruction for me, I say it's all I want.

56:46.500 --> 56:50.084
I haven't even had paperback hits in my last few books.

56:50.264 --> 56:56.290
I say it's because Zebra and Penguin, Penguin said there was any clothes in print, but you couldn't get it.

56:56.310 --> 57:00.334
Now, that won't do.

57:00.414 --> 57:03.938
So I had no fewer than four.

57:04.103 --> 57:21.224
which is not a great many, people who teach or were inventing courses in modern American fiction, whether it be the Chandler mode or whatever, in some cases not even the hard-boiled book, they wanted to include Eddie Coyle on their reading list.

57:21.244 --> 57:26.550
Every one of those four teachers probably worth a hundred copies of that book and paperback, and they couldn't get it.

57:26.902 --> 57:31.007
But they wouldn't say it was out of print so I could get the license back and sell it.

57:31.027 --> 57:33.750
Now I have gotten it back, and I'll print it.

57:33.770 --> 57:34.471
They'll do a nice job.

57:34.852 --> 57:35.833
They've done a nice job.

57:35.853 --> 57:36.434
It's a good job.

57:36.854 --> 57:39.437
And it's the original plates from Bolt, so it's good-sized type.

57:39.457 --> 57:40.959
Even guys are aging.

57:41.820 --> 57:43.923
That's what they do, by the way.

57:43.943 --> 57:44.524
Yep.

57:44.824 --> 57:45.785
But the Bolt does.

57:45.805 --> 57:46.005
Yeah.

57:46.025 --> 57:46.806
They pick the plates.

57:47.167 --> 57:49.389
Yeah, they pick up the plates from now.

57:49.409 --> 57:51.492
Because we were talking about the paperbacks in my book.

57:52.147 --> 57:54.751
There are a couple little errors in there.

57:55.271 --> 57:56.994
Not big, but I'd like to go in his fix.

57:58.035 --> 58:01.139
And they said, well, this is a big deal.

58:01.159 --> 58:02.341
What do you mean it's a big deal?

58:02.381 --> 58:04.063
I mean, it's a new deal.

58:04.083 --> 58:05.265
Oh, we take the plates.

58:05.285 --> 58:07.128
You know, I said, look, I've got a 1930.

58:07.148 --> 58:08.069
It's got to be a 1919.

58:08.710 --> 58:09.911
Yes, please do that.

58:09.931 --> 58:11.413
No, I'm not going to do that yet.

58:12.014 --> 58:12.535
Let me show you something.

58:13.021 --> 58:15.404
Thank you.

58:15.784 --> 58:39.533
If there's a way to drag my sleeve through something, I will do it.

58:40.574 --> 58:41.155
Isn't it?

58:41.135 --> 58:48.647
He had lunch over here, over there, which was Ben Bradley, and he brought along Tom Winship.

58:48.667 --> 58:52.393
And while we were sitting there, John Harrington comes over because he spies.

58:52.453 --> 58:54.897
And he's looking at me.

58:55.077 --> 58:55.938
He's looking at him.

58:56.079 --> 58:58.182
And Winship says immediately, oh.

58:58.567 --> 59:01.072
Say hello to Ben Bradley, you know.

59:01.092 --> 59:05.080
And Winship was the guy that came along on the invite.

59:05.100 --> 59:07.104
And he was giving me this stuff.

59:07.124 --> 59:07.785
Who is this guy?

59:07.805 --> 59:08.266
Meeting me.

59:08.286 --> 59:13.737
Who is this guy that rates this table in the corner with Bradley and Winship?

59:13.757 --> 59:16.062
And then they introduced me, and he's looking at me.

59:16.082 --> 59:17.004
And I wouldn't help him.

59:17.024 --> 59:18.006
You know, I wouldn't help him out of it.

59:18.026 --> 59:20.170
Like, you could have said, the other guy will let this go.

59:20.740 --> 59:25.247
He's wondering, I could see in his mind, he's wondering who is this guy.

59:25.267 --> 59:26.208
He's meaning me.

59:26.228 --> 59:30.154
That is a hot shot.

59:30.394 --> 59:32.117
It is.

59:32.277 --> 59:33.319
I like the book a lot.

59:33.339 --> 59:33.719
I read it.

59:33.819 --> 59:36.143
I know him from a lot of good.

59:36.163 --> 59:36.824
I enjoyed it.

59:36.844 --> 59:38.546
And then I was asked to review it.

59:38.666 --> 59:40.569
He said very nice things about you.

59:41.651 --> 59:42.332
He won't now.

59:42.592 --> 59:45.036
Because I was asked to review the book for the Daily Telegram.

59:45.717 --> 59:46.738
And I read it critically.

59:46.758 --> 59:48.100
And it's quite a different piece of work.

59:48.120 --> 59:48.621
It stinks.

59:50.710 --> 01:00:12.448
I first discovered this when I was reading it yes I know that I meant to do it that way I know what it's worth

01:00:12.428 --> 01:00:23.678
I noticed, that's almost what I said.

01:00:24.279 --> 01:00:32.246
I was reading aloud at the Marketplace Bookstore's May luncheon down at the Kuhner Messer Inn, and I came to that, and I almost threw it across the room and walked out.

01:00:32.426 --> 01:00:34.768
Try and fix it, by the way.

01:00:34.828 --> 01:00:36.430
Oh, I can't do it.

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:37.551
They always say that.

01:00:37.871 --> 01:00:39.472
I'm going to even date it for you.

01:00:39.492 --> 01:00:40.754
Date it and put it in what it should be.

01:00:41.374 --> 01:00:41.975
Yes, of course.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:42.435
All right.

01:00:42.415 --> 01:00:59.775
And I will, by the way, I promise you, on the tape, I'm writing a monthly column for a new magazine called Biblio.

01:01:00.836 --> 01:01:01.737
Who started that?

01:01:02.338 --> 01:01:04.080
Somebody on the West Coast.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.444
I'm going to start on the fourth level.
