WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:12.711
And we're talking with Jack Driscoll to my left, who is the editor-in-residence of the News in the Future Project, and Walter Bender, who's director.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.395
Tell me, what is News of the Future?

00:15.415 --> 00:17.598
Is it content or is it technology?

00:17.698 --> 00:19.160
Well, it's not News of the Future.

00:19.180 --> 00:20.282
It's News in the Future.

00:20.302 --> 00:24.848
News of the Future is our secret crystal ball factory down the basement.

00:24.868 --> 00:28.513
That's too secret for you to see.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.017
News in the Future is... Well, that's a key...

00:31.199 --> 00:32.501
That's a key point, isn't it?

00:32.741 --> 00:33.382
Yes.

00:33.402 --> 00:34.584
And I missed it.

00:34.604 --> 00:35.886
I missed it.

00:35.906 --> 00:37.408
Go ahead.

00:37.769 --> 00:43.598
Well, those of us who believe in print and text actually look at the words that are printed on the page.

00:44.980 --> 00:54.374
But anyway, News in the Future is looking at how is technology going to impact news.

00:54.394 --> 00:57.618
And it's a consortium.

00:57.638 --> 01:00.683
It's sort of in the spirit of the Media Lab that we're working.

01:01.034 --> 01:07.825
very closely with industry, sort of the usual players and some unusual players.

01:09.026 --> 01:13.994
So it's companies like the Boston Globe and the New York Times, Tribune, ABC.

01:14.014 --> 01:22.247
It's also companies like Televisa in Mexico, China in Argentina, Estado in Brazil.

01:22.908 --> 01:29.218
And it's also a few other companies, McCann Erickson, JCPenney,

01:29.840 --> 01:34.665
companies that are involved in advertising as well as the editorial side of news.

01:35.185 --> 01:37.307
Now these are companies that are supporting?

01:37.607 --> 01:41.331
Well, they're not just supporting the work, they're very much involved in the work.

01:42.372 --> 01:56.926
So one of the things we're doing is we're trying, we're being pretty aggressive about making sure that the work doesn't just happen in a sort of a myopic laboratory setting, but also goes out into the field.

01:56.966 --> 01:58.227
So there's a lot of

01:58.730 --> 02:12.583
experimentation that's been going on that finds its way very quickly out of the laboratory into the hands of the people who are actually making and using news.

02:14.064 --> 02:17.327
Is this a study, or is this development of technology?

02:17.347 --> 02:26.796
Well, it's mostly development of technology, and I guess we had a thesis early on

02:27.012 --> 02:29.256
which was that there were going to be three impacts.

02:29.696 --> 02:35.746
One is an impact on just the efficiency of news, of the news industry.

02:36.487 --> 02:37.569
That's sort of a no-brainer.

02:37.689 --> 02:45.441
Technology will facilitate production and distribution.

02:46.002 --> 02:51.290
Technology will facilitate the gathering and dissemination of news.

02:52.212 --> 02:53.053
A second...

02:53.489 --> 03:08.531
a little less obvious, but somewhat more obvious today, five years after the fact, is convenience, that technology will have a direct impact on the convenience of accessing news by the consumer.

03:08.832 --> 03:14.881
So things like getting news on alphanumeric pagers and the like.

03:16.864 --> 03:22.332
I'll just sort of give you the framework, and then we can drill down wherever you'd like.

03:22.649 --> 03:38.470
And the third is really where our minds and hearts are at, and that is making news be more relevant to people, that technology can have a direct impact on the relevancy of news and make news be more empowering.

03:39.050 --> 03:44.858
Well, I'll give you some specific examples in a few minutes, okay?

03:46.200 --> 03:52.588
But just to make it somewhat more concrete, if people don't find news relevant, they're not going to

03:53.429 --> 04:22.491
bother to be engaged they're not going to bother to use news and the news industry is in trouble regardless of how efficient it is but so what we're trying to do is we're trying to look at how do people use news what what can make news be more not not just more convenient but more accessible in in every sense of the word and more useful to people so we're looking at trying to figure out how people

04:22.893 --> 04:27.099
how people use news and how people might use news.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.945
And that's making us sort of rethink where news comes from.

04:33.507 --> 04:40.997
Right now, even in the era of the Internet, most news sort of comes from above.

04:41.378 --> 04:51.111
It comes from news organizations, and there's not as much, although there's beginning to be a lot more sort of a,

04:51.445 --> 04:59.434
grassroots news coming out of a community phenomenon, and we're looking pretty closely at that.

04:59.454 --> 05:01.997
So what he's saying, Jack, is the local angle, I guess, right?

05:02.498 --> 05:15.112
Which allows your paper to, you know, just by the nature of the business, how can you possibly cover every meeting, every PTA?

05:15.132 --> 05:19.857
Is that the kind of thing that you're talking about, relevance in terms of how it affects the daily life?

05:19.938 --> 05:21.199
That's one example.

05:21.382 --> 05:24.546
There's some other kinds of examples as well.

05:25.086 --> 05:34.096
Maybe I should jump right into what I think is a pretty concrete, easy to grasp example.

05:34.156 --> 05:36.579
We have a system called PLUM.

05:36.599 --> 05:37.320
P-L-U-M.

05:37.360 --> 05:37.700
P-L-U-M.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.586
It's an acronym that stands for Peace, Love, and Understanding Machine.

05:42.606 --> 05:43.086
That's great.

05:44.128 --> 05:45.009
Is that the machine?

05:45.309 --> 05:46.610
Yeah, it's a machine.

05:47.031 --> 05:50.815
It was a machine developed by one of our graduate students,

05:51.200 --> 05:58.691
S-A-R-A, SARA, ELO, E-L-O.

06:00.354 --> 06:14.395
And the idea behind PLUM is that it looks at the problem of personalization from a slightly different perspective.

06:16.999 --> 06:19.603
Right now, most people think about

06:20.495 --> 06:24.620
personalization is a very one-dimensional problem.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.481
It's sort of a problem.

06:25.541 --> 06:28.585
How do we decide what news you're going to see?

06:28.625 --> 06:30.106
I've got one of those programs.

06:30.126 --> 06:32.810
Yeah, maybe you can go grab that.

06:33.450 --> 06:39.578
But so the New York Times prints all the news that's fit to print.

06:39.598 --> 06:40.739
That's one filter.

06:40.799 --> 06:44.864
That's one way in which you could get the news that you're interested in.

06:44.924 --> 06:50.130
Another way would be to have a personal learning agent

06:51.055 --> 06:56.202
cruising the internet, finding things on your behalf, and there are other mechanisms as well.

06:56.563 --> 07:00.809
That's all about selecting of content or filtering of content.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.291
Is it the individual selecting?

07:02.471 --> 07:04.053
Well, it could be the individual.

07:04.113 --> 07:07.698
It could be some organization selected on your behalf.

07:08.139 --> 07:09.581
We'll debate that one in a second.

07:09.621 --> 07:14.127
But that's still thinking about the problem

07:15.136 --> 07:16.879
of news dissemination.

07:16.959 --> 07:21.705
It's just all the stuff that's happening out here, and some subset of it's going to be presented in front of me.

07:22.086 --> 07:23.508
Is there something I could have, by the way?

07:23.548 --> 07:23.849
No.

07:25.271 --> 07:27.534
It would be, but this is the last one that I know of.

07:27.914 --> 07:28.575
We're all out.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.338
Maybe we could Xerox it, though.

07:30.538 --> 07:33.603
Oh, yeah.

07:33.623 --> 07:35.305
He's a collector.

07:35.572 --> 07:40.763
I also believe that you can never have too much material.

07:41.465 --> 07:45.313
Apparently Cornell's got too many books.

07:46.556 --> 07:51.066
I don't have too many though.

07:52.143 --> 08:10.913
It's like a feel-good machine, isn't it?

08:11.013 --> 08:15.180
Peace, love.

08:15.397 --> 08:16.278
And it's a machine?

08:16.979 --> 08:17.739
This is it?

08:17.779 --> 08:19.401
This is what we're looking at?

08:19.421 --> 08:19.601
No.

08:20.021 --> 08:25.587
If he uses the word machine, it's a technology.

08:25.607 --> 08:26.528
Uh-huh.

08:26.548 --> 08:34.295
Well, I mean, it's a technology that's been embedded inside of a machine, so it's something that's been instantiated.

08:34.315 --> 08:35.336
It's not just an idea.

08:35.497 --> 08:39.621
But do we foresee it as something that some people are going to carry around with him?

08:39.781 --> 08:41.142
This guy's a real good reporter.

08:41.182 --> 08:44.205
He asks lots of questions, but he never listens to the answers.

08:44.742 --> 08:52.312
So how about if I tell you what it is, and then you can ask me.

08:53.694 --> 08:55.576
Okay.

08:57.739 --> 08:59.762
You know, you can use your hour any way you want.

08:59.882 --> 09:01.584
I find you fascinating.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.646
I like listening to you.

09:03.206 --> 09:08.113
I'd like to just hear your stories, and that's great.

09:09.635 --> 09:10.716
Anyway, whatever.

09:12.559 --> 09:14.361
What plum does that takes a story?

09:14.780 --> 09:32.155
It doesn't make a decision about whether this story is important to you, but given that the story is one that you should see, what it tries to do is it tries to make sure that the story has the context which is going to make it more readily accessible to you.

09:33.016 --> 09:36.839
So in this case, it's a story about a flood, a flood in China.

09:38.161 --> 09:43.285
And what the system does, the machine does, is it automatically...

09:43.433 --> 09:47.298
identifies key facts and figures in the story.

09:47.558 --> 09:53.546
So one fact in the story is that 250,000 acres of farmland were flooded.

09:54.668 --> 09:59.655
Now... It's prioritizing the facts for you.

09:59.675 --> 10:00.656
No, not yet.

10:01.157 --> 10:03.920
Okay, what it's done is it's found these facts, okay?

10:04.721 --> 10:06.724
Then what it's doing is... But it's marshalling them, though.

10:07.683 --> 10:08.884
I know I should be listening.

10:08.904 --> 10:09.605
I'm sorry.

10:09.765 --> 10:10.185
I'm sorry.

10:10.205 --> 10:11.367
I'm just challenging something.

10:12.948 --> 10:17.032
You're not challenging yet, but you're not listening either.

10:17.052 --> 10:21.056
Maybe what we should do is just give you some papers and you can read them.

10:21.076 --> 10:22.057
No, I'm sorry.

10:22.077 --> 10:24.579
I apologize.

10:24.599 --> 10:26.241
Go ahead.

10:26.261 --> 10:33.848
Anyway, it's prioritizing the facts and presenting them to you in a nice prioritized order, and that's how it works.

10:34.649 --> 10:35.530
That's how machine works.

10:37.298 --> 10:38.800
So let me tell you what it really does.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.083
Okay.

10:41.103 --> 10:47.812
It finds, never mind how for the time being, but it finds these facts in the story.

10:48.553 --> 11:00.810
Now, when I'm presented with 250,000 acres of farmland, my eyes glass over because I don't know what 250,000 acres of farmland is.

11:00.830 --> 11:05.196
So what Plum wants to do is Plum wants to make that number mean something to me.

11:06.357 --> 11:09.881
It wants to give me context by which I'll understand what that number means.

11:10.943 --> 11:18.952
Because, see, Reuter, when they wrote the story, they just, you know, this is just straight off the wire, okay?

11:19.112 --> 11:25.520
They didn't know about me, so they didn't know that I was going to glass over when I saw that number.

11:26.201 --> 11:34.491
So what Plumbus says, okay, Walter, you're from Boston, so therefore I'm going to tell you that this is what 250,000 acres means.

11:35.078 --> 11:39.502
250,000 acres is that big on a map of Boston.

11:40.063 --> 11:41.324
That's interesting.

11:41.344 --> 11:46.348
So what Plum has done is said, okay, if you're going to read the story, I want you to understand it.

11:47.149 --> 11:51.453
I want you to understand the context in which the story exists.

11:51.733 --> 12:00.321
And one key element is to be able to understand things like what 250,000 acres is relative to what you know, what your experiences are.

12:01.042 --> 12:04.225
So what Plum's all about is it's about trying to make

12:04.559 --> 12:07.344
connections that provide context.

12:07.845 --> 12:11.252
So, for example, another example of context is China.

12:11.973 --> 12:13.516
This flood took place in China.

12:13.556 --> 12:14.518
Well, what's China?

12:14.578 --> 12:15.941
China's some country way out there.

12:16.081 --> 12:16.682
Wait a second.

12:17.343 --> 12:21.211
There are 14,000 people in Boston who speak one of the Chinese languages at home.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.377
So maybe China isn't something quite so far away.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.563
Maybe China is something that's important right back home.

12:28.117 --> 12:33.064
This is not in the story, but this is the system that's saying we know that there were 14,000 people.

12:33.084 --> 12:33.504
Right, right.

12:33.544 --> 12:39.312
So Plum, this is the story, and this is what Plum provides, is the context around the story.

12:39.332 --> 12:39.793
What do you call it?

12:39.813 --> 12:41.015
This is a subtext?

12:41.075 --> 12:41.676
What is it?

12:41.696 --> 12:43.058
Do you have a name for this?

12:43.078 --> 12:44.019
We call it context.

12:44.480 --> 12:44.940
Context.

12:46.062 --> 12:47.283
Okay, now you could present it.

12:47.644 --> 12:49.927
There are many different ways in which that could be presented.

12:49.967 --> 12:53.412
It could be presented as links in a hypertext system.

12:53.432 --> 12:56.236
It could be presented as insets or sidebars.

12:56.336 --> 12:57.938
It could be presented as...

12:58.542 --> 13:00.644
any number of different ways.

13:00.865 --> 13:02.767
But the point is it's there.

13:02.827 --> 13:05.690
It makes the story more accessible.

13:05.890 --> 13:15.701
It takes something that's very generic and it casts it in a framework that makes it make more sense to somebody from Boston.

13:15.721 --> 13:18.984
Or if I'm not from Boston, what if I'm from Buenos Aires?

13:19.004 --> 13:21.367
Or Plum can do the same thing.

13:21.527 --> 13:24.830
Or if I'm from Tampra, which is a little town in Finland, same thing.

13:25.791 --> 13:27.233
So the idea is that Plum

13:28.664 --> 13:34.691
takes the story, analyzes it, takes who I am, and provides the context.

13:34.891 --> 13:37.234
Now, you showed me Buenos Aires and some other country.

13:37.254 --> 13:41.399
Does Plum also translate it?

13:41.419 --> 13:41.479
No.

13:41.499 --> 13:55.195
Plum doesn't do translation, although the technology behind Plum is one that we think down the road is going to lead toward better machine translation, but it's not mature enough yet to...

13:55.782 --> 13:57.644
I'm looking for one word.

13:58.245 --> 14:01.108
We refer to that as argumentation.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.309
Argumentation?

14:02.430 --> 14:02.950
Right.

14:02.970 --> 14:18.208
So that you take a text, a bare text, and essentially through hyperlinks, you're augmenting the text and giving it more value, more context.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.791
So that's basically what this is.

14:20.811 --> 14:25.536
Now, this is a concept that's been developed here, or is this actually

14:25.786 --> 14:30.333
Is Plum actually advice that you can... It's both.

14:30.373 --> 14:35.582
That's why I said machine, because it really is something that exists and works.

14:35.602 --> 14:37.826
It's a concept that's been implemented.

14:39.048 --> 14:40.089
It's been instantiated.

14:40.109 --> 14:44.496
Is it something like this that you can carry around, or is it something that has to be like this?

14:44.516 --> 14:49.785
No, it's something that is a software program

14:50.525 --> 15:00.896
and its instantiation can be inside of a device like this, or a device like that, or a device like that, or something that's printed.

15:00.916 --> 15:01.636
What was that word?

15:01.657 --> 15:02.477
Substantiated.

15:03.378 --> 15:04.259
Instantiated.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.703
That's a new word I made.

15:07.723 --> 15:09.044
Did you use that word?

15:09.064 --> 15:12.548
I don't know if I used it, but I didn't know it.

15:12.568 --> 15:15.010
You learned it when you got here, though.

15:15.050 --> 15:17.173
It puts it in several forms.

15:17.213 --> 15:18.574
Did you know that word before you

15:19.111 --> 15:20.433
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

15:20.453 --> 15:20.653
Okay.

15:21.935 --> 15:26.340
I know it sounds like a silly question, but... No, that's a good question.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.084
That's the first good question you've asked as far as I'm concerned.

15:31.227 --> 15:32.829
I've just got a curiosity.

15:33.209 --> 15:34.311
The others were naive?

15:34.371 --> 15:37.054
No, the others were jumping the gun.

15:37.495 --> 15:37.935
Okay.

15:37.955 --> 15:40.899
Okay, the others were asking before you actually listened.

15:41.480 --> 15:41.640
Okay.

15:41.660 --> 15:48.409
And that was a question where you asked a question in response to something that was said to you, which I think is generally more appropriate, but...

15:49.030 --> 15:53.235
I'm not in a good mood today, I guess.

15:53.435 --> 15:55.017
Monday morning.

15:55.097 --> 15:56.819
Monday morning, that's fine.

15:56.939 --> 15:59.582
And I'm used to it.

16:00.704 --> 16:16.422
So anyway, I mean, this was an example, I think this is an example of what I mean by relevance, that this makes this story much more relevant to a reader because it makes the story relate to something the reader actually knows.

16:16.874 --> 16:20.439
So it's not abstract anymore, but it's much more concrete.

16:20.659 --> 16:24.164
Of course, the word relevance is such a buzzword today.

16:24.724 --> 16:31.093
And this is not the context at all, obviously, that you're using it.

16:32.034 --> 16:39.043
We talk about the literary canon, which is another consideration of this book, which has nothing to do with what you're talking about, obviously.

16:39.624 --> 16:44.350
But people suggest, well, we don't have to teach Shakespeare anymore because it's not relevant to it.

16:44.735 --> 16:45.636
to people's lives.

16:45.696 --> 16:48.359
And then I'm saying, well, my God, how do you determine relevance?

16:48.459 --> 16:50.782
You know, what is relevance?

16:50.802 --> 17:09.783
And I thought that maybe this machine was determining content, the relevance of certain content, and therefore perhaps even prioritizing the points that some programmer or some individual or another machine is determining what is most important for me.

17:09.883 --> 17:11.164
That's why I was

17:11.330 --> 17:11.651
Right.

17:11.671 --> 17:12.993
That's why I was a little exercise.

17:14.275 --> 17:15.697
But I thought you might be suggesting.

17:15.897 --> 17:17.139
Maybe you could address yourself.

17:17.299 --> 17:17.680
Sure.

17:17.720 --> 17:25.372
I think that what he was talking about is localization plus.

17:27.776 --> 17:31.502
When you were a young reporter, you were asked to localize certain stories.

17:31.522 --> 17:32.924
I still do it.

17:32.944 --> 17:38.232
So what this does is it brings home a disaster in a remote area.

17:39.967 --> 17:43.651
not only to a person's place, but to a person themselves.

17:44.111 --> 17:52.439
In other words, it's not just localizing it, but it's giving it broader implications for you, where you are.

17:52.459 --> 17:55.222
So it's a triangulation, really, of information.

17:56.142 --> 18:07.273
I'm a lifelong writer and journalist, and I certainly know Jack Fiscal's reputation, and I'm curious what brings you to the

18:07.726 --> 18:18.436
Are you kind of looking at it in terms of content or in terms of delivery, in terms of start anywhere you want?

18:18.836 --> 18:37.513
Yeah, I mean, just to back up to when this group first started, I was at the Globe, I was editor of the Globe, and Negropani and Walter gathered a bunch of people from the media and said, this thing was happening so fast.

18:37.730 --> 18:48.261
that we feel the only way to look down the road five or ten years is to jointly do it.

18:48.281 --> 18:52.546
And I thought, well, they're never going to agree to work together.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.068
But sure enough, they did.

18:55.088 --> 19:03.417
Companies that are essentially competitors and have been at each other's throats for years suddenly decided that there was a common interest

19:04.797 --> 19:07.440
And so that's how the consortium started.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.163
I was representing the Globe.

19:11.665 --> 19:17.793
When the group became formal, the Globe asked me to be the representative.

19:17.813 --> 19:32.931
When I left the Globe, which was on my 60th birthday, I continued to be interested in the students and in the projects.

19:34.075 --> 19:38.581
I guess I was a volunteer, if you will, for a while.

19:39.562 --> 19:52.899
So now I'm here a day or two a week working with some of the students on the projects because I have a perspective that I hope can be helpful for them.

19:53.019 --> 20:02.631
And also working with the sponsors as sort of a liaison person and an interpreter of what's going on.

20:03.775 --> 20:15.192
someone who can facilitate getting the good ideas that are terminating here out into the real world.

20:15.212 --> 20:17.756
So that's what I see myself doing.

20:17.796 --> 20:23.665
Jumping ahead, do you see this technology replacing the print medium?

20:23.685 --> 20:23.906
No.

20:27.231 --> 20:27.731
I see it.

20:28.092 --> 20:29.013
No, I don't.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.375
I mean, I see it supplementing.

20:31.718 --> 20:32.719
I don't see it replacing it.

20:33.880 --> 20:45.619
What does the print, what is art for the individual that would suggest that it would continue to work?

20:45.639 --> 20:52.530
I think it's pretty—the elements of print are fairly well known.

20:52.550 --> 21:00.883
It's easy to carry, it's cheap, and all of those various things.

21:01.184 --> 21:04.008
And so, for some people, that will continue to be true.

21:05.250 --> 21:12.361
For others, it will depend on where they are and what their needs are.

21:12.381 --> 21:23.718
And they'll have television, radio, and computer to get their information, audio, whatever.

21:23.738 --> 21:26.382
Who would deliver this?

21:26.902 --> 21:32.190
You buy the machine and you pay for a service that would cull all these publications?

21:32.651 --> 21:36.016
Right now I buy a machine and pay for a service from the Boston Globe.

21:36.536 --> 21:48.835
The machine I buy is printed paper and the service is a collection of editorial judgments and assignments to reporters and collection of advertising.

21:48.855 --> 21:50.698
That's going to remain the same.

21:50.758 --> 21:52.260
It's going to evolve.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.343
There are going to be certain changes to it.

21:54.526 --> 21:58.452
the machine nature of it, the fact that it gets delivered as ink on paper.

21:58.512 --> 22:05.644
Well, I don't know whether you believe Joe Jacobson and what he showed you this morning.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.388
Joe didn't make it.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.371
Oh, you're doing that after.

22:10.471 --> 22:12.434
Okay, okay, okay.

22:13.796 --> 22:15.519
But I'm quite eager to see it.

22:17.562 --> 22:21.208
I think at some point we're going to have

22:22.960 --> 22:28.006
displays, electronic displays, that are as good or better than paper.

22:29.367 --> 22:41.702
And when that happens, I think that the economics of paper are going to be such that most people are going to move towards these electronic displays.

22:41.802 --> 22:52.174
And Marvin Minsky, I like to quote, said that paper will be a luxury only the rich can afford eventually.

22:52.525 --> 23:21.570
Now, that doesn't mean that the things that you associate with the paper edition of the Boston Globe or the New York Times or the Chicago Tribune or whatever has to go away, because I think that those kinds of things, the notion that there is a Jack Driscoll making decisions, that can all exist in this electronic form as well.

23:21.770 --> 23:29.057
and the look and feel we can mimic to whatever extent we choose to in our electronic paper.

23:29.778 --> 23:40.368
So I think that it's a red herring worrying about whether or not it's going to be electronic or income paper.

23:40.408 --> 23:45.453
I think the more interesting question is what's the content of the future?

23:45.473 --> 23:49.337
What are the decisions that are made in terms of what content people see?

23:49.797 --> 23:51.439
Can we use a computer to

23:51.908 --> 23:56.113
make that content be more useful to people, more engaging to people?

23:56.554 --> 24:04.383
Can we provide a forum for local communities as well as these national or international forums?

24:05.424 --> 24:07.386
Those are the more interesting issues.

24:07.426 --> 24:14.054
How does society get impacted by this change in terms of technology?

24:14.074 --> 24:21.443
So it's the intelligence of the machine and the way that intelligence gets applied to news that I think is much more important than

24:21.828 --> 24:25.514
whether or not we still squeeze trees or use electronic media.

24:25.634 --> 24:32.285
And I really do have a larger concern, and I'm just, you know, a couple of things just over the last couple of days.

24:32.406 --> 24:41.881
For instance, you know, all right, the Dallas Morning News at McVeigh story is very interesting, that they moved it first on the Internet, you know, before they printed it.

24:42.622 --> 24:45.748
I'm wondering if this was considered on their part.

24:45.988 --> 24:48.392
Were they just kind of child ballooning it out there?

24:48.828 --> 24:50.169
You know, I wonder.

24:50.550 --> 24:54.693
And I went and I called it up, and I said, this is a historic news story.

24:55.074 --> 24:55.855
I printed it out.

24:55.875 --> 25:00.499
I said, this is a very historic thing, because I saved interesting news stories.

25:01.199 --> 25:16.894
And then, and just quite unrelated to that, on 60 Minutes last night, they had a segment on, you know, the thing that really concerns me is that anybody, any jerk, any psychopath can put stuff on, can get a website.

25:17.414 --> 25:25.544
can put anything out there, and put it out as, you know, TWA conspiracy brought down by missile, put up a pretty graphic, and it goes on.

25:25.584 --> 25:37.740
Now using, you call up a site, and I don't know, maybe you just funnel it into Plum, and Plum now gives it a legitimacy by saying TWA, Long Island, X number of acres.

25:39.542 --> 25:42.366
Well, I mean, that's certainly a problem.

25:42.386 --> 25:47.252
And the thing that I respect, let me just let you say, the thing I respect most about the newspaper business

25:47.485 --> 25:57.954
that we have people like Jack Driscoll sitting up there, and he has set up his structure, his tiers of editors, and that there are people who are saying, who did you talk to?

25:58.034 --> 25:59.876
Let me see your facts.

25:59.896 --> 26:00.817
You know?

26:01.157 --> 26:07.202
And I'm wondering if you're going to have these kinds of safeguards in place electronically.

26:07.343 --> 26:09.224
That's a question.

26:09.725 --> 26:16.851
And I think the answer is that yes, we're going to need those kind of safeguards, and that there's

26:17.590 --> 26:20.193
certain sources are going to be more credible than other sources.

26:20.253 --> 26:29.223
But I'll argue that that's true today in the print media as well, that certain sources, certain publications are a lot more credible than others.

26:30.044 --> 26:39.815
And granted, today, anybody can have a website, any lunatic or any not lunatic.

26:39.936 --> 26:40.736
And many of them do.

26:40.797 --> 26:42.338
And many of them do.

26:42.478 --> 26:46.483
And only wealthy lunatics can have newspapers.

26:47.088 --> 26:48.249
So there's a change there.

26:48.269 --> 26:49.871
You don't own newspapers.

26:49.891 --> 26:51.753
Well, own or control newspapers.

26:51.773 --> 26:58.640
Yeah, but we have laws in place to protect people from libelous and scandalous allegations.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.763
And you don't have this kind of protection in place out here.

27:02.224 --> 27:07.469
You could be putting stuff out there, and the subject won't even know that it's going on out there.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.711
That was one of the things of the 60 Minutes thing.

27:09.832 --> 27:10.973
They say, show us 60 Minutes.

27:11.513 --> 27:13.275
And all of a sudden, all these things are popping up.

27:13.295 --> 27:15.137
They didn't have a clue that this stuff was being

27:15.455 --> 27:20.642
said about them, you know, or the Mrs. Fields cookies, you know, that they had sponsored a party for O.J.

27:20.682 --> 27:24.127
Simpson and that there was a measurable loss in their business, 1%.

27:24.187 --> 27:31.778
They didn't even know the thing had been out there, you know.

27:32.719 --> 27:41.271
What was a measurable loss for General Motors when their truck was exploded on NBC?

27:41.331 --> 27:44.095
What was the measurable loss for...

27:44.328 --> 27:50.337
whatever the name of that grocery chain was when ABC did their little number on them.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.419
They deserved it, though.

27:51.439 --> 27:55.004
I mean, nobody disputed the facts of the case and how they were acquired.

27:56.286 --> 28:08.344
I'm not sure, but I guess what I'm saying is that the present media doesn't have a monopoly on integrity either, or it doesn't necessarily have a monopoly on truth.

28:08.847 --> 28:10.349
It cuts both ways.

28:10.849 --> 28:11.490
I hear you.

28:11.530 --> 28:12.231
It's a problem.

28:12.271 --> 28:27.750
It's one that technology can only partly address, and yet I guess I don't think that we should be... I'm not a big believer in censorship.

28:27.770 --> 28:30.253
I'm not a big believer in squelching voices.

28:31.214 --> 28:34.838
I guess I'm more interested in...

28:35.442 --> 28:38.787
giving people voice, because I think a lot of people don't get heard.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.149
You should be heard.

28:40.169 --> 28:44.035
I think a lot of people get heard who shouldn't be heard, too.

28:44.396 --> 28:53.791
You know, you always have a trade-off when you try to design freedom into systems.

28:53.991 --> 28:54.412
Oh, I know.

28:54.912 --> 28:58.598
I think it's fascinating what you do.

28:59.607 --> 29:00.789
I'm just asking questions.

29:00.809 --> 29:01.930
Does this seem appropriate?

29:03.112 --> 29:05.816
No, it's a problem.

29:05.836 --> 29:23.142
And certainly, I mean, already the beginnings of some mechanisms that one could argue are either wonderful mechanisms for censorship or potentially wonderful mechanisms for addressing this issue of credibility.

29:23.402 --> 29:28.450
So, for example, the PIC system, which is the ratings system,

29:28.700 --> 29:35.048
system that is being advocated by the World Wide Web Consortium.

29:36.710 --> 29:57.938
What it does is it says, hey, we can make a commodity out of rating or lending weight to the credibility or the suitability of websites.

29:58.038 --> 29:58.318
Now,

29:58.855 --> 30:20.889
What that means is it means that I could subscribe to the Jack Driscoll rating service, which means that there's going to be, if I get things from the Jack Driscoll rating service, then there's going to be the Jack Driscoll seal of approval, just like there's a good housekeeping seal of approval or some other seal of approval.

30:21.630 --> 30:26.938
And so I think you're going to begin to see a lot more of that kind of service being offered.

30:27.256 --> 30:31.502
by legitimate people, and also by charlatans.

30:31.522 --> 30:54.394
But the story will be clearly identified as a New York Times news service story, or a Reuters story, or a... Well, no, but it could be clearly identified as one that Jack Criscoll has, in his organization, has verified, or selected, or... I think another way of looking at this is that you have the Internet, it's a fax,

30:55.083 --> 30:58.508
And you have websites and all the rest.

30:59.369 --> 31:00.951
You also have the Media Lab.

31:00.971 --> 31:08.661
And the Media Lab is in the process of trying to do some things that make sense out of all this.

31:08.941 --> 31:11.625
One thing, for instance, is data hiding.

31:11.645 --> 31:12.506
Data hiding?

31:12.686 --> 31:13.487
Right.

31:13.507 --> 31:23.200
Which has been developed under the News in the Future program and deals with print, audio, and videos.

31:25.846 --> 31:31.972
And what it does is that it preserves the original copy, in effect.

31:31.992 --> 31:34.034
Is that too short a short answer?

31:34.094 --> 31:36.516
So does it maintain an archival copy?

31:36.616 --> 31:36.977
No, no, no.

31:37.037 --> 31:54.233
What it does is it—one way to apply this technology is to think of it as a tamper-proofing, so that if something gets changed—if a picture gets changed, like maybe they put your head on

31:55.006 --> 31:58.811
Jack's body for terrific consideration.

31:58.972 --> 32:04.159
Or if a text article gets changed, then it shows up.

32:04.580 --> 32:08.285
The tamper mechanism.

32:08.545 --> 32:10.248
That's sort of an example.

32:10.788 --> 32:16.757
But that's an example of how technology can help address this problem, but it's not the solution.

32:16.777 --> 32:18.379
Do you mind just exploring that a bit?

32:18.620 --> 32:19.200
Sure.

32:20.082 --> 32:22.465
Another consideration I have a part of,

32:22.698 --> 32:35.509
from what you're doing is, you know, Brown University has this hyper-fiction interactive, where you invite students to, you know, the author is not really the author of the work.

32:36.490 --> 32:41.815
And, you know, it is something blind as an author.

32:41.855 --> 32:44.377
I mean, can people come in and fool around with it and change it?

32:45.398 --> 32:48.481
And, of course, now it comes to me.

32:48.501 --> 32:50.983
I mean, this is a real possibility, isn't it?

32:51.470 --> 32:58.257
you're pampering with news stories that could be a great concern to you.

32:58.397 --> 33:03.462
And so you are developing ways to safeguard that this kind of thing doesn't happen.

33:03.482 --> 33:03.922
Is that right?

33:04.483 --> 33:05.584
Yeah, well, we're trying to.

33:05.784 --> 33:06.685
It's a hard problem.

33:06.745 --> 33:11.910
But do you also, on the other hand, also foresee interactive news stories?

33:12.871 --> 33:19.317
Well, one might anticipate some of that by where you can selectively pull things out to make it more relevant to yourself.

33:20.360 --> 33:25.125
Well, certainly people have already interacted with news.

33:27.327 --> 33:35.315
I like to describe the traditional print newspaper as a very highly interactive device.

33:36.817 --> 33:46.106
It's been designed to allow me, with great facility, to ignore 90% of the content.

33:46.547 --> 33:49.590
When I read the Boston Globe, I don't read every word.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.120
I pick and choose what I want to read.

33:53.320 --> 33:57.826
I'm directed by the pagination.

33:57.866 --> 33:59.107
I'm directed by the layout.

34:00.369 --> 34:10.842
The editor interacts with me because when I turn to page 13 to follow up on an article on page 1, there are other related articles that are on page 13.

34:11.703 --> 34:19.273
So it's already a highly interactive medium, and it's only going to get more so as we provide more information.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.221
tools for doing that kind of thing.

34:21.842 --> 34:31.592
On the other hand, let me turn it around a little bit and maybe I should let Jack describe a project that we've got going called Silver Stringers.

34:32.693 --> 34:48.028
And the reason I want, I think it's an important project because it is, again, it's looking at is there room for other voices and how might one think about

34:49.122 --> 34:51.705
getting these additional voices.

34:51.866 --> 34:53.207
Kind of like an op-ed page?

34:53.728 --> 34:55.871
Well, why don't you describe what it is?

34:57.213 --> 35:00.397
Now, let's get back to tampering, because that is something that concerns me.

35:01.398 --> 35:03.581
That has to be a real consideration.

35:03.601 --> 35:04.542
I hadn't even thought of that.

35:04.582 --> 35:15.096
But what if somebody is able, we have hackers that can penetrate virtually anything else, can they go in and change a story and change the art, alter it?

35:15.857 --> 35:15.957
Yeah.

35:16.628 --> 35:21.134
in a way that suits their personal political purposes or whatever.

35:22.016 --> 35:22.677
Is that possible?

35:23.117 --> 35:23.758
It's possible.

35:24.780 --> 35:28.966
And it would carry the imprimatur of the authority of this plumb.

35:29.626 --> 35:37.518
You might think you're reading a New York Times story, but in actuality, I mean, somebody can't go and alter every newspaper that's written on the streets.

35:37.538 --> 35:37.978
That's done.

35:37.998 --> 35:38.619
That's printed.

35:38.659 --> 35:40.782
That's in type.

35:40.802 --> 35:41.523
And that's out there.

35:42.084 --> 35:44.087
But I'm wondering now if that is a threat.

35:44.928 --> 35:49.755
Well, that's a good question.

35:49.815 --> 35:56.345
Let's turn it around for a second and look at it from a different perspective, which is, say, the congressional record.

35:56.586 --> 36:08.724
C-SPAN is an interesting take on the congressional record, because, in fact, what gets put down in print and distributed and exists is not really what happened.

36:08.884 --> 36:12.690
C-SPAN is what happened.

36:13.514 --> 36:18.702
Well, again, it's your concept of what the congressional record is, too, I suppose.

36:18.722 --> 36:25.013
Whether it's what happened or it's what the congressmen want to say what happened, right?

36:25.073 --> 36:33.206
And so you could say, is the printed newspaper what happened or what the Boston Globe wanted to say as to what happened?

36:33.927 --> 36:37.453
I've skirted the issue, and I apologize for that.

36:38.114 --> 36:38.374
Okay.

36:39.164 --> 36:46.875
By the same token, I signed a document here that said anything I see about machines, I have to run by you, and that's fine.

36:49.219 --> 36:55.748
But that also gives you an opportunity to say, well, I know I said this, but maybe we can change the quote a little bit to say this.

36:55.788 --> 37:02.558
That's kind of the... Well, we still have copyright laws, so you can't tamper.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.361
That's right, legally.

37:05.663 --> 37:07.045
Technically, you can tamper.

37:07.902 --> 37:09.264
Temple with what, though?

37:09.825 --> 37:10.886
Temple with text.

37:11.106 --> 37:14.451
Text, with images, whatever.

37:14.471 --> 37:15.773
Technically, that can be done.

37:15.993 --> 37:19.979
But no, I'm suggesting a criminal act, you know, an unlawful act.

37:19.999 --> 37:35.901
So there are laws, and that's why I think data hiding has a terrific future, is because it supplements copyright laws, for instance, and protects the original version, which is

37:36.708 --> 37:40.472
or proves a case in the copyright.

37:40.492 --> 37:46.218
I understand, but I still don't see how you can change all 600,000 globes that went out on the street.

37:46.959 --> 37:47.840
But you know what?

37:48.401 --> 37:48.761
You're right.

37:49.201 --> 37:55.408
You can't go and change every one of these 600,000 or even 6,000 globes that are out on the street.

37:55.748 --> 37:59.472
But the bottom line is that electronic media exists.

38:00.453 --> 38:01.455
It's not going away.

38:03.737 --> 38:06.580
Pandora's box is already opened.

38:06.695 --> 38:13.825
It's not a matter of saying, boy, I wish we had the good old days when it was harder to distort.

38:14.386 --> 38:18.332
Not that it's ever been hard to distort, but I wish we had the good old days.

38:18.352 --> 38:19.594
Well, that doesn't cut it.

38:20.074 --> 38:23.379
Because the bottom line is that there is electronic media.

38:24.461 --> 38:31.211
There are people out there publishing and consuming information in electronic form.

38:32.272 --> 38:35.537
And so the question is, what do we do about that?

38:36.597 --> 38:40.662
build mechanisms for protection, for credibility in that environment.

38:41.503 --> 38:43.285
And that's really what we're trying to do.

38:43.325 --> 38:45.508
We're not trying to say it doesn't exist.

38:45.568 --> 38:47.070
We're not trying to close our eyes to it.

38:47.090 --> 38:48.651
We're trying to say it exists.

38:49.673 --> 38:54.859
And since it exists, let's see if we can make it be helpful rather than hurtful.

38:54.899 --> 39:00.726
Let's see if we can make it be positive for society rather than harmful to society.

39:03.429 --> 39:04.090
So what

39:04.441 --> 39:09.286
And data hiding and tamper-proofing technology is one example of that.

39:09.746 --> 39:17.133
Another example might be something like a PIC system, which I was previously describing.

39:17.193 --> 39:22.178
Another example is something like Plum, which tries to take things and put them into context.

39:24.179 --> 39:29.905
Another example is technology that we've been developing.

39:30.245 --> 39:33.368
This is a work of another graduate student, Warren Sack,

39:33.702 --> 39:37.746
which is able to try to analyze point of view.

39:39.267 --> 39:45.533
So what it does is it gives you an indicator, what's the point of view from which this article's been written.

39:45.553 --> 39:48.916
So then you have the possibility, well, you've got two possibilities.

39:49.436 --> 39:53.700
One possibility is you can say, only give me things from a particular point of view.

39:54.781 --> 40:01.988
The other possibility is you can say, make sure that I'm getting a well-rounded representation of any issue.

40:02.913 --> 40:15.211
So it can cut both ways, but again, these are examples of where I think the technology is opening up opportunities for some kind of improvement as well.

40:15.231 --> 40:16.894
Now, MIT impresses everybody.

40:16.914 --> 40:27.329
I mean, not only is this a great institution of learning and research, but there's a practical point to everything.

40:27.349 --> 40:32.717
I mean, stuff is done here because when you have these sponsors, they expect it to go into the field.

40:32.984 --> 40:37.690
Do you have any kind of timetable for any of these things that you're talking about?

40:38.691 --> 40:41.394
Well, some of the things that we've been talking about are in the field.

40:42.516 --> 41:02.620
So, for example, some of the data hiding work that we are describing is being discussed by the digital video community as being part of the digital video standard, as one example.

41:03.089 --> 41:08.595
be used to figure out whether people are copying or changing video.

41:10.998 --> 41:29.097
Because whereas even just several years ago it would have been impractical for people to manipulate video just as it is even today impractical for people to manipulate the 600,000 printed editions of the Boston Globe, well that's changing.

41:29.532 --> 41:35.360
and the ability to manipulate video is with us today.

41:35.581 --> 41:43.532
So building some of those mechanisms in for protection is something that is happening today that the industry is worrying about right now.

41:44.093 --> 41:48.920
So you're obviously alert to it, then, and to the threat, I guess.

41:50.242 --> 41:51.844
Yeah, yeah.

41:52.565 --> 41:54.628
How about this plum?

41:55.773 --> 42:03.908
Well, some aspects of Plum are being integrated into some commercial services.

42:05.070 --> 42:11.703
Bits and pieces of Plum were embedded into the IBM website covering the Olympics last summer.

42:14.708 --> 42:19.317
Plum is probably still a little bit too immature.

42:20.343 --> 42:25.027
for widespread deployment in that it only works with a narrow domain.

42:25.047 --> 42:27.490
It's not a general purpose solution yet.

42:28.551 --> 42:30.833
So that development still has to happen.

42:31.453 --> 42:41.643
But the PLUM concept is something that's beginning to find its way into different projects and applications.

42:41.763 --> 42:44.625
And it is largely a software thing.

42:44.685 --> 42:49.810
At this point, it's not a device that you're talking about.

42:49.992 --> 42:58.105
We have forty projects, at least, that are going on in—just in NIF, we have a hundred—how many?

42:58.305 --> 42:59.407
In what, I'm sorry?

42:59.447 --> 43:02.752
A hundred and seventy-eight that are going on in the media.

43:02.832 --> 43:03.834
One hundred and seventy-eight.

43:03.954 --> 43:04.235
Right.

43:04.996 --> 43:05.537
Projects.

43:06.278 --> 43:06.799
Wow.

43:06.819 --> 43:07.881
Individual projects.

43:07.921 --> 43:16.995
So one, for instance, it is a hardware and software project is called Audio Notebook.

43:17.228 --> 43:27.819
It would be a real benefit to you right now if you had it, because this little gadget that you have here would be inside your notebook.

43:27.839 --> 43:31.363
You would be using a stenographer's notebook, just as you're using now.

43:33.085 --> 43:40.432
It would be taping, and as you turn the page, the system would read the change of pages.

43:40.652 --> 43:43.135
And then when you go back to transcribe your notes,

43:44.077 --> 43:51.226
You go to page four, and you want a quote from—you remember Walter Bender talking about high-definition TV.

43:51.246 --> 44:02.159
And so you find where you made a note of HDTV, you put your pen on there, and in your transcription, your audio plays back at that point.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.242
And you can slow it down, speed it up.

44:05.322 --> 44:12.531
So when you retranscribe notes to write a book or an article for a newspaper, you can easily—

44:13.135 --> 44:16.320
reconstruct your quotes probably ten times faster.

44:17.241 --> 44:21.908
Are these things that I can see at some point, and somebody walk me around?

44:22.128 --> 44:24.051
It doesn't have to necessarily be today.

44:24.432 --> 44:34.988
I mean, I won't be taking photographs or even taking— Well, I mean, what you will be doing, though, is you'll be taking time away from students.

44:35.108 --> 44:36.890
Uh-huh.

44:38.533 --> 44:42.619
I'd love to get some color, you know, for this.

44:42.785 --> 45:12.150
Well, I also wanted to mention Fishwrap, which is the electronic newspaper that was developed by freshmen here at Media Lab that is now being used by the San Francisco Chronicle and Intel and several other organizations where you can personalize and localize your news

45:12.367 --> 45:15.191
presentation.

45:15.651 --> 45:19.997
That's really a superb engine, if you will.

45:21.519 --> 45:30.510
So, for instance, I now live in New Hampshire, and when I log on to Fishwrap, the first thing it gives me is NH News.

45:31.251 --> 45:34.055
And I click on that, and it gives me all the news.

45:35.016 --> 45:39.522
It'll even give me Portsmouth News first, if something happens in the Portsmouth area.

45:40.413 --> 45:44.096
And so I can get New Hampshire local news right away.

45:44.196 --> 45:46.879
Then I get international news.

45:46.899 --> 45:54.245
I can package my areas of interest in such a way that I can quickly find out what I want to know.

45:54.265 --> 46:00.811
And it just draws it right out of the day's news base database.

46:00.831 --> 46:04.014
So that's been going for four years.

46:05.055 --> 46:08.378
It's used on the campus by students, faculty,

46:08.847 --> 46:10.449
And you call it fishwrap.

46:10.469 --> 46:11.390
It's called fishwrap.

46:11.870 --> 46:15.394
In fact, the San Francisco Chronicles still calls it fishwrap.

46:15.414 --> 46:18.738
You can look it up on their website.

46:18.978 --> 46:21.641
Fishwrap, on the SF gate, I know that.

46:21.681 --> 46:24.404
It's on SF gate, yeah.

46:24.424 --> 46:26.667
You'll see how it's done.

46:26.687 --> 46:30.972
The Silver Stringers Project, we've really just begun.

46:31.212 --> 46:38.280
We started it six months ago in a community ten miles north of here, Mill Road.

46:39.307 --> 46:42.230
which has a senior center for drop-in.

46:44.352 --> 47:06.495
And so we went out there and we organized a bunch of people and said, we'd like to tap into your wisdom and have you do some writing or photography or artwork that tells the community your perspectives.

47:07.606 --> 47:12.813
And these are people who had really no computer experience.

47:12.833 --> 47:19.382
A couple of them had used word processors in their work environment before they retired.

47:21.425 --> 47:25.310
I think only one of them had a computer at home.

47:25.330 --> 47:29.636
And so now we have a website called the Melrose Mirror.

47:31.219 --> 47:35.925
And it has probably 40 stories,

47:37.542 --> 48:05.743
And so what we're looking at is how a community of interest builds sort of a community within a community.

48:06.078 --> 48:17.737
And so that age bracket has certain characteristics and develops certain kinds of stories that make for a pretty interesting website.

48:17.757 --> 48:25.510
It's just beginning, in a way, but it's there, and it's pretty fascinating.

48:25.530 --> 48:26.972
So it's Melrose Mirror.

48:26.992 --> 48:28.354
It's called Melrose Mirror.

48:28.374 --> 48:33.182
I just want to punch that up as Melrose Mirror.

48:35.339 --> 48:48.699
You know, we're trying to see from our perspective how people who are in their 70s or 80s respond in this kind of environment.

48:48.740 --> 48:54.889
What are the tools that they need to be reporters or photographers or artists?

48:56.572 --> 49:02.781
What can we provide that would make it easier for them to do the kinds of things that they want to do?

49:03.385 --> 49:07.889
I've looked at your list of sponsors, and you do have some book publishers.

49:08.009 --> 49:13.175
Does the News and the Future Project also embrace technology as it regards the printed book?

49:13.595 --> 49:16.378
Yeah, I think that's a good question.

49:16.398 --> 49:16.918
Okay.

49:16.938 --> 49:17.058
Right.

49:17.078 --> 49:21.162
If you're going to be seeing him, is he going to be seeing Joe later?

49:21.182 --> 49:21.923
Yeah.

49:21.943 --> 49:22.343
Eventually?

49:22.363 --> 49:23.224
Yeah.

49:23.264 --> 49:23.745
Did he come in?

49:24.165 --> 49:24.265
Yeah.

49:24.425 --> 49:25.587
Oh, good.

49:25.607 --> 49:25.787
Oh, good.

49:25.807 --> 49:25.967
Right.

49:25.987 --> 49:27.208
You have to forgive me, by the way.

49:27.228 --> 49:29.030
Well, I didn't know that we were on this morning.

49:29.110 --> 49:31.753
I would have been a little more sharper at the beginning.

49:32.313 --> 49:33.274
Yeah.

49:33.676 --> 49:39.104
more willing to listen.

49:39.124 --> 49:39.485
I'm sorry.

49:39.525 --> 49:40.366
I didn't mean to.

49:40.987 --> 49:43.110
I'm just grouchy Monday mornings, period.

49:43.130 --> 49:51.803
Well, that's cool, but anything that I didn't ask you that you think I should know at this particular point?

49:53.545 --> 50:02.839
Well, I guess, let me just say, finish what I was going to say at the very beginning, which was that

50:04.591 --> 50:18.369
I mentioned three areas that we think technology is going to impact, and there are three technologies we think are relevant or important technologies to be addressing, and that's what we're working on.

50:19.069 --> 50:32.927
And those three technologies, which to more or less degree also impact books, I think some of them to a lesser degree, one of them is the technology of describing content formed by computer.

50:33.869 --> 50:48.485
And that's going to be critical for A, sort of just the efficient processing, but it's also going to be critical when we really are trying to address these issues of things like credibility and tamper-proofing and sorting and filtering and the like.

50:48.885 --> 50:57.815
That having the computer have a better understanding of text and content and what that means is really in a critical path.

50:57.835 --> 50:59.516
So we've got a big effort in that area.

51:00.097 --> 51:02.880
Second is the technology of

51:03.367 --> 51:06.752
observation, that we want to be observant about people and community.

51:07.473 --> 51:16.525
Because if we're going to begin to personalize or localize, we need to have a sense of who we're personalizing for or localizing for.

51:17.206 --> 51:22.373
So that technology is also, I think, a critical technology.

51:22.974 --> 51:27.100
The third technology is the technology of presentation or look and feel.

51:27.500 --> 51:30.184
And to what degree does the technology of presentation

51:30.468 --> 51:38.879
again, impact efficiency and convenience, but also impact sort of the way in which news is used.

51:39.660 --> 51:51.376
So, again, one example is just how do I take the New York Times and make it still work in a little page format like you get on the Alphabet and the Pager.

51:51.596 --> 51:56.543
It's not clear you can, but it's something we're interested in.

51:56.742 --> 52:00.806
How do I take advantage of the fact that I've got a computer in here?

52:00.846 --> 52:16.001
And there's one example of a project called Information Landscapes, which is really sort of a marriage of a computer flight simulator and a newspaper or a book.

52:16.021 --> 52:18.504
And there are two offspring of that marriage.

52:18.684 --> 52:26.732
One is paper airplanes, and the other is sort of this really very refreshing

52:26.965 --> 52:31.351
really quite terrific, very powerful way of accessing information.

52:31.391 --> 52:39.121
And we're very much interested in facilitating your ability to find your way through this virtual world.

52:40.283 --> 52:43.107
And a lot of that's got to do with interface.

52:43.127 --> 52:50.096
So how do you deal with the 90,000 things that you get back from an AltaVista search?

52:51.037 --> 52:54.762
And so we're looking at what are technologies that can facilitate that

52:55.214 --> 53:03.925
Another is the mundane stuff that Joe Jacobson is doing, which is making electronic paper.

53:08.491 --> 53:09.472
That's my name.

53:09.492 --> 53:09.593
Yeah.

53:09.613 --> 53:20.867
That's going to have an impact on the economics of all this, but it's also going to have a big impact on where and when electronic media is accessible.

53:21.978 --> 53:25.521
Because right now, you can't really use electronic media on the subway.

53:26.723 --> 53:27.163
That's right.

53:27.283 --> 53:27.624
Okay.

53:27.684 --> 53:30.166
But when Joe is done, you'll be able to.

53:31.708 --> 53:32.989
Or how about on an airplane?

53:33.069 --> 53:34.610
Or on an airplane.

53:34.670 --> 53:35.832
It's even more difficult.

53:36.672 --> 53:45.421
Well, the airplane's easier than the subway, because an airplane, at least you've got that little tray you can put down, and the lighting's a little bit less.

53:45.441 --> 53:47.923
You can't get enough air.

53:47.943 --> 53:49.605
Oh, you've got...

53:50.260 --> 53:55.907
modem jacks and all the telephones in the back of the seats now.

53:56.207 --> 54:05.278
I think, of course, if your battery's only good for three hours or four hours— Well, then that's why you go into the John and you plug in about 110 volts.

54:08.061 --> 54:15.390
Anyway, so that's— Yeah, I think if you look at the way the lab is organized through various departments,

54:16.197 --> 54:21.264
of the elements that he's talked about, the design elements.

54:22.065 --> 54:36.864
There's also—we haven't mentioned the learning element, which is an area where we're really dealing with education, dealing with children, how children use— I have a chapter in my new book on— Really?

54:36.884 --> 54:41.090
Yeah, learning and literacy and all of a sudden.

54:41.110 --> 54:44.314
This is cutting-edge stuff.

54:45.425 --> 54:56.398
So one of the things, if you look at all of those areas, we even have a breakout, if you will, of age groupings.

54:56.458 --> 54:59.642
We're trying to look at 10-year-olds.

54:59.742 --> 55:01.965
We're trying to look at teenagers.

55:02.025 --> 55:04.909
We're trying to look at middle-aged people.

55:05.229 --> 55:12.698
So you said, look at these various people, how they— As users, as— What kind of a technique, maybe—

55:13.015 --> 55:21.604
What kinds of technologies need to be developed to facilitate those age groups?

55:24.908 --> 55:27.891
How they respond?

55:29.053 --> 55:36.281
We're looking at communities of interest.

55:40.145 --> 55:42.988
I guess my hour is up.

55:43.306 --> 55:44.459
Thank you.

55:44.520 --> 55:46.583
Sure.
