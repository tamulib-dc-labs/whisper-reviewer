WEBVTT

00:03.862 --> 00:06.165
the decision to throw something out.

00:06.525 --> 00:24.607
The judgment to throw something out is a cultural statement itself where I, as a librarian or supervisor of a collection, say I know enough about Western or world or Eastern culture to say that civilization does not need to preserve this artifact.

00:25.188 --> 00:31.776
That is an awesome judgment, especially when you take one or two of these things

00:32.313 --> 00:39.803
And you say, this is what I found by accident going through pile after pile after pile of stuff.

00:39.823 --> 00:50.257
But if I wanted to find this particular song, one of these, could I ever find it in every bookshop?

00:50.918 --> 00:52.660
There are books with low prices.

00:54.723 --> 00:59.850
But if you went looking for them, you would look perhaps a lifetime to find them.

00:59.870 --> 01:00.711
And never find it.

01:00.731 --> 01:01.712
And never find it.

01:02.789 --> 01:03.951
Never find it.

01:03.971 --> 01:07.678
Let me take you to the next step after we went through Ezra Cornell's letterbooks.

01:09.862 --> 01:14.390
And just before you go to Ezra Cornell, I go back to Ignacio Sanchez.

01:16.413 --> 01:21.743
Ignacio Sanchez is the black composer from the 18th century.

01:22.178 --> 01:24.983
Now we're going to hear a lot about Ignacio Sanchez.

01:25.003 --> 01:26.906
I think so far, right.

01:27.066 --> 01:31.093
I think he survives in two or three copies that I can track.

01:31.114 --> 01:32.456
How did you find his biography?

01:32.656 --> 01:37.224
Well, he's mentioned in lists of black musicians, but nobody's paid too much attention to him.

01:37.244 --> 01:38.286
He's never been recorded.

01:38.346 --> 01:40.069
Nobody's done very much.

01:40.403 --> 02:04.099
examined his music in any way you really want me to tell me i've got it xeroxed at home but i couldn't find it the other day so i don't know what it's like i haven't looked in a while i went to the library of congress and copied it yeah yeah it's dance tunes and what you might say is from what i remember there's nothing really amazing about it

02:04.450 --> 02:16.563
But that's another way of saying he was this African-based composer in the mainstream of European music.

02:16.583 --> 02:17.985
Who did something.

02:18.005 --> 02:18.765
Who did something.

02:19.106 --> 02:33.141
And on the other hand... On the other hand, the Chevalier Saint-Georges, who might be thrown out by some provincial librarian because the librarian never heard of him, and that's the judge of preserving culture,

02:34.100 --> 02:44.172
On the other hand, the Chevalier Saint-Georges rather strikes me as what Napoleon would sound like had he played the violin.

02:45.113 --> 02:46.435
Absolutely amazing.

02:46.455 --> 02:49.058
Just bombastic all over the place.

02:49.298 --> 02:50.279
Really wonderful stuff.

02:52.742 --> 02:57.168
John Wesley Powell was one of our professors at Illinois Wesley in 1865 to 67.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.773
He produced an Atlas of the Grand Canyon.

03:01.793 --> 03:03.195
It's going in a shocking direction.

03:03.496 --> 03:06.799
And there's a companion volume to it.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.461
I'm not sure whether we have it or not.

03:09.542 --> 03:10.282
I haven't checked.

03:10.302 --> 03:11.824
I should have given the story.

03:11.904 --> 03:13.986
Illinois Wesleyan, yeah.

03:14.006 --> 03:18.710
Because we have some Powell pottery that he brought back from his Indian expositions.

03:18.730 --> 03:21.432
We've worked with some of his books, but we didn't have more.

03:21.453 --> 03:23.094
Whether we have this one or not, I don't know.

03:24.395 --> 03:31.782
I was talking to a book dealer the other day, and he told me about a Powell item he had just acquired.

03:31.981 --> 03:35.707
He got the Atlas and the companion volume.

03:35.927 --> 03:38.090
I said, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

03:38.270 --> 03:39.232
How much was that?

03:39.612 --> 03:40.313
How much is it?

03:40.874 --> 03:43.098
He said, well, it's about $2,000.

03:43.358 --> 03:45.761
That's extraordinary.

03:45.782 --> 03:46.743
That's a letter.

03:46.763 --> 03:48.826
Extraordinary, yeah.

03:49.267 --> 03:56.217
And then he said at the same place he got the Atlas,

03:56.669 --> 03:58.994
He also got another six-volume set.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.718
I haven't a clue what it is.

04:00.859 --> 04:03.946
I think except it's something Scandinavian.

04:03.966 --> 04:08.055
Six volumes that has an auction record of something like $6,500.

04:08.095 --> 04:13.227
And then he told me what the sale was.

04:14.033 --> 04:31.839
that this was a sale at a college library where the librarian had determined that they really didn't need 19th century atlases because those had been superseded, so they were being sold for one dollar a volume until noon when it was a dollar a bag.

04:32.540 --> 04:43.095
But the dealer, bless him, had the wits to think that if he waited until noon, they might be gone, so he wasted his money and paid a dollar a piece.

04:44.003 --> 04:49.972
and was about to 1,000 times his investment in each book.

04:49.992 --> 04:56.542
This is the kind of librarian who is a menace in the academic community.

04:56.562 --> 05:03.492
So I called the president of the place, concerned, and said, do you know this is going on?

05:04.854 --> 05:06.597
And he didn't know anything about it.

05:06.657 --> 05:09.842
He wanted to talk to the dealer, and he was not pleased.

05:10.396 --> 05:11.237
The president was.

05:11.257 --> 05:12.979
He was not pleased.

05:13.119 --> 05:21.449
I mean, from a fiscal point of view, if you want to deaccession something worth $2,000, please do try to get $1,500, not two bucks.

05:22.430 --> 05:27.196
Last year, my wife... I was going to tell you another thing I have.

05:28.317 --> 05:30.440
It was the art museum deaccession, though.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.261
That's the story.

05:31.561 --> 05:34.825
Yeah, well... Can you believe this?

05:34.845 --> 05:36.387
Well, are you happy or glad?

05:36.535 --> 05:40.200
That's, you know, as a collector, you have to ask yourself a question.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.183
Don't give a thing to a museum or to a library.

05:43.203 --> 05:45.706
Well, that's a real question right there.

05:45.767 --> 05:52.054
It used to be that the public regarded the museum as a point of preservation.

05:52.975 --> 05:56.620
And when the world finds out,

05:57.072 --> 06:05.942
that Cornell does what it does, that the Worcester Museum does what it does, it may be less either.

06:06.723 --> 06:10.367
Well, I may not report the Worcester Museum.

06:10.387 --> 06:10.607
Well, well.

06:10.627 --> 06:11.528
What can Art Museum, what do they know about?

06:11.548 --> 06:13.710
Well, you know, life is full of that.

06:13.810 --> 06:25.223
I got from one source, somewhat similar, a box, a nice little blue box, like that.

06:26.097 --> 06:37.051
And there are a few pencils in it, and it says on the top, J. Thoreau pencils, Thoreau and Company pencils.

06:37.151 --> 06:37.852
Exactly.

06:38.272 --> 06:52.830
When I saw this, I said... So, there are a bunch of pencils, only one of which, but one of which is...

06:53.030 --> 07:00.902
And Henry Petrovsky of Duke has written a book on the pencil, and there's a whole chapter in there.

07:00.922 --> 07:07.252
And I've got this box, and I bought it on a suspicion that that's what it was.

07:13.923 --> 07:17.468
And that's why Thoreau goes in my multi-talented book, because

07:17.752 --> 07:29.386
He's writing all these things, but he's also the guy who puts number two and three and one on all our pencils that we use every day, just to make a little money.

07:29.847 --> 07:34.492
But this is something that a place got rid of that they didn't want.

07:36.014 --> 07:37.576
I'm not going to tell you where it was.

07:37.656 --> 07:39.198
You'd be totally outraged.

07:39.218 --> 07:40.480
Well, you can tell me.

07:40.500 --> 07:40.840
It was Yale.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.198
It doesn't bother me at all.

07:43.218 --> 07:45.900
Bill Reese has told me about the things that go on over at Yale.

07:46.221 --> 07:47.682
You know the Colonel House papers?

07:48.523 --> 07:49.123
No.

07:49.143 --> 08:08.680
Well, House was Wilson's chief of staff during World War I and published the two volumes called Papers of Colonel House, which was kind of the inner workings of the peace process in the Wilson White House.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.742
Yale has the

08:11.870 --> 08:17.095
house papers, and these were put up for bids, and I got them.

08:17.195 --> 08:18.396
I have the house envelopes.

08:19.397 --> 08:25.163
They sold the envelopes, so I have a bunch of envelopes addressed by Woodrow Wilson.

08:25.283 --> 08:32.930
I can show you nine examples of Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, forwarding mail.

08:35.412 --> 08:38.315
Can you remind of Francis Henry Fayer?

08:38.335 --> 08:38.656
Sure.

08:38.676 --> 08:41.218
He's the head of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

08:41.654 --> 08:50.264
Anyway, please don't put all this in there.

08:50.284 --> 09:00.196
One day, Rowan says to me, I got some college stuff that you might be interested in.

09:00.356 --> 09:03.059
Well, we lived in New London, so I went back and forth.

09:03.079 --> 09:05.422
It was an hour and a quarter up there all the time.

09:05.802 --> 09:08.826
We were up there once every two weeks or so.

09:09.127 --> 09:12.392
So he said, I've got some college stuff coming in.

09:12.412 --> 09:14.115
You might be interested in college.

09:15.537 --> 09:16.258
You'll hear.

09:17.159 --> 09:21.145
He said, it's a collection of college catalogs after 1876.

09:21.165 --> 09:30.780
That he particularly bid on the

09:30.980 --> 09:40.032
student publications where the likes of Frederick Remington and other, I think mostly Yale kids, who later turned out to be famous artists, were publishing as students.

09:41.494 --> 09:43.777
And so that's what he wanted.

09:44.498 --> 09:48.864
And the rest of the stuff was going to the dump.

09:48.884 --> 09:50.126
I couldn't.

09:51.227 --> 09:52.049
Rowling was going to send it to the dump.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.931
Now, you better not put this in.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.835
We'll be here in the town.

09:57.575 --> 09:59.338
I said, well, gee, that's interesting.

09:59.358 --> 10:02.904
Let me come right up and look at some of this.

10:02.924 --> 10:03.124
Oh, Jesus.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.887
Great.

10:05.167 --> 10:13.761
Here's a box of 1870s, 1880s, Harvard-class books, Yale-class books,

10:14.112 --> 10:23.480
little tiny black college catalogs from the South, frontier colleges from Arkansas and Oklahoma and Montana.

10:23.620 --> 10:26.623
Roland said, you can have any of this you want.

10:26.663 --> 10:32.328
Some of it I've already trashed, but any of it you want, you can have.

10:32.348 --> 10:37.632
I said, if you don't mind, I'll take the whole thing.

10:37.652 --> 10:43.157
Now, what I had bid off was 11,000 credits.

10:44.200 --> 10:44.641
How much?

10:46.103 --> 10:49.087
He gave it to me.

10:49.127 --> 10:49.868
He gave it to me.

10:49.888 --> 10:51.551
I mean, the man is amazing.

10:52.012 --> 10:52.933
From 1876 on.

10:52.993 --> 11:04.270
So that I found myself, and luckily Connecticut College had an empty library building that hadn't been developed at that point.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.613
So I found myself a proud possessor.

11:07.218 --> 11:14.550
of a near-completeness of Harvard class books, you know, the year they graduate, three years, not five years, ten years.

11:14.850 --> 11:17.314
I'll tell you in a minute.

11:18.055 --> 11:25.648
And Treasurer's reports, catalogs of zillions of colleges all over the country.

11:28.512 --> 11:34.542
I held personally the equal of

11:36.665 --> 11:40.290
the collection in the stocks at Yale for Brown.

11:40.591 --> 11:42.393
Right down in Selkridge.

11:42.513 --> 11:44.596
Right under my nose, that's where he was, the Selkridge.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.899
American antiquarian.

11:47.981 --> 11:59.297
They decided they couldn't keep anything after 1876, so they sold it to Batwell, and he gave me what he didn't buy.

12:00.425 --> 12:04.230
I was just elected AAS last year.

12:04.310 --> 12:06.193
Well, don't tell us to.

12:06.213 --> 12:06.713
No, I don't.

12:06.733 --> 12:12.160
So anyway, so, you know, there comes a limit in life.

12:13.382 --> 12:14.984
I gave it to Hobart.

12:15.665 --> 12:19.390
That's why the first BD you got said it was at Hobart.

12:19.410 --> 12:20.592
But I called Hobart.

12:20.772 --> 12:22.494
We're building, we're expanding our library.

12:22.514 --> 12:24.657
We're going to go from 200 to 400,000 volumes.

12:24.697 --> 12:27.040
We hope we're going to get a whole new building.

12:27.644 --> 12:31.670
That's the hope.

12:32.551 --> 12:39.821
And believe it or not, we are still digressing on the subject of the man to whom the book is to be sent.

12:39.981 --> 12:42.044
We're still on the opening question, Plato.

12:44.928 --> 12:51.457
And so I called the librarian.

12:51.797 --> 12:55.963
I mean, the only thing better than one librarian

12:56.247 --> 12:57.609
who didn't do it right is two.

12:58.410 --> 13:01.673
I called the librarian at Hobart.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.696
I said, Bill, I used to be provost there.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.638
I said, you know that stuff I gave you?

13:06.158 --> 13:08.782
It's taken up half your basement.

13:08.802 --> 13:10.423
Well, are you doing anything with it?

13:10.964 --> 13:11.525
No.

13:11.545 --> 13:11.985
You want it?

13:12.386 --> 13:12.846
You want it?

13:14.608 --> 13:15.329
You can have it.

13:18.172 --> 13:18.453
Really?

13:18.933 --> 13:20.715
Yeah, just pay us the shipping, OK?

13:20.876 --> 13:21.276
Jeez.

13:21.577 --> 13:29.070
So I was given this present, in a sense, twice, and it now belongs to Illinois Wesley, where I'm in a position to protect it.

13:29.310 --> 13:32.756
How do you see its value at your school?

13:32.776 --> 13:33.958
Well, let's put it this way.

13:34.980 --> 13:41.251
If you're a student in sociology and you want to study American elites or something like that, is there such a thing?

13:41.431 --> 13:47.061
Now, I want to put down my club membership, not my...

13:47.311 --> 13:50.315
AT&T calling card number.

13:50.335 --> 14:04.515
I have to concentrate on this for a minute here.

14:04.816 --> 14:05.637
Here's an example.

14:05.877 --> 14:10.163
The Harvard class books, and there may be a shelf this long.

14:10.615 --> 14:22.853
The class of 1883 alone, and then another size chunk for 1884, the same for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, amounts to a series of brag books.

14:23.288 --> 14:24.229
Of what books?

14:24.349 --> 14:25.010
Bragg books.

14:25.110 --> 14:25.751
Bragg.

14:25.791 --> 14:26.312
Yeah.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.593
I mean, this is what I own.

14:27.613 --> 14:28.494
This is who I am.

14:28.514 --> 14:29.375
This is what I do.

14:29.455 --> 14:32.018
It's an early Who's School thing that somebody writes about.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.680
But for a whole college class.

14:33.701 --> 14:35.663
You see who these boys are, where they come.

14:35.683 --> 14:39.948
I tell you where they prepared, what school they went to.

14:40.068 --> 14:40.529
Exactly.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.171
Exactly.

14:42.191 --> 14:47.457
So for sociology students, the ability to follow a single Harvard class

14:48.618 --> 14:54.686
through 40 years of adult life is a magnificent godsend for a senior thesis.

14:54.766 --> 14:56.669
You could maybe do a nice little monograph.

14:56.809 --> 14:57.690
Of course you could.

14:58.551 --> 15:03.058
And you could do one after another, after another, after another.

15:03.078 --> 15:06.082
So where's the perception of these people?

15:06.102 --> 15:08.385
Have they become too jaded to...?

15:09.907 --> 15:10.668
It's hard to know.

15:11.048 --> 15:17.477
I mean, there are those who are protectors of the heritage and those who think their goal in life

15:17.980 --> 15:21.685
is to have a library with lots of extra space on clean shelves.

15:21.705 --> 15:25.771
You know, you're telling me things that are very, that are within this, that I'm looking at.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.814
Now, let's, should we finish with William Horn?

15:27.874 --> 15:28.495
Oh, yeah.

15:28.515 --> 15:31.639
He's just, just say, William H. Horn.

15:31.759 --> 15:34.162
It's not like Lena, there's no E there, right?

15:34.203 --> 15:35.905
Book collector and son of a book collector.

15:35.925 --> 15:38.889
Well, I'm not sure, H-O-R-N, no E, right.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.773
He's got a middle initial, but I'm not sure what it is.

15:42.214 --> 15:45.338
His father is a book collector, and he is a book collector.

15:48.473 --> 15:52.499
You don't want me to be too specific about... Please give us a grant.

15:52.559 --> 15:56.445
No, no, I mean Americana and stuff like that.

15:56.805 --> 15:57.346
Yeah.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.791
Well, he had a lot of Americana.

16:00.811 --> 16:01.512
And bird stuff.

16:01.993 --> 16:04.476
He also has a Trotsky autograph.

16:04.536 --> 16:08.282
He's got a History of the Russian Revolution, that modern library thing, signed by Trotsky.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.303
He showed me in his office.

16:09.323 --> 16:13.669
He may not like it, but I don't know much about it.

16:13.689 --> 16:14.350
Well, all right.

16:14.370 --> 16:14.751
All right.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.952
I'll take care of it.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.414
I won't be home until Sunday.

16:18.495 --> 16:20.818
Oh, well, thank you, thank you, thank you.

16:21.679 --> 16:25.764
But I'm not so mad that I couldn't find a bookshop.

16:27.166 --> 16:30.551
I'll send you one of the seconds.

16:30.591 --> 16:32.894
The fifths have a change, which I'm not too happy about.

16:33.415 --> 16:36.739
Okay, the rare second edition as opposed to the fifth.

16:36.879 --> 16:39.823
Well, the obtainable part.

16:40.825 --> 16:41.966
I wonder which one I have.

16:42.026 --> 16:43.028
I'll have to go on and see.

16:43.048 --> 16:44.670
The first does have to have a one in it.

16:45.460 --> 16:54.393
I personally like the letters because they have very quiet little collections.

16:54.514 --> 17:00.162
So, turn off your machine.

17:00.202 --> 17:01.324
There are three ways.

17:01.364 --> 17:04.949
Three ways I found it.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.553
I'm writing a book on multi-talented people.

17:08.208 --> 17:14.594
And here is a book on book collecting with the absolutely right title.

17:14.614 --> 17:17.376
You know, these people are slightly nuts or more.

17:18.477 --> 17:19.859
So how did you find it?

17:21.760 --> 17:23.322
I think we saw a review of it.

17:23.422 --> 17:25.884
My wife said, this is absolutely for you.

17:27.145 --> 17:29.167
And so we went right out and got it.

17:30.348 --> 17:35.693
I think it was a Christmas present or maybe one of those that came in the house before, you know, was consumed before Christmas.

17:36.494 --> 17:37.675
But...

17:38.515 --> 17:44.484
Here was this amazing man who had a PhD in psychology, but ran a restaurant and wrote cookbooks.

17:44.584 --> 17:45.085
I loved it.

17:45.205 --> 17:49.672
It's right in my multi-talented thing.

17:50.313 --> 17:51.474
Well, yeah.

17:55.741 --> 18:06.497
And then to find that he gave 100 books here, as he said, you've probably heard this a million times, he gives...

18:07.118 --> 18:14.393
100,000 books to Iowa, and 100,000 items, and I say, okay, Louis, that's enough.

18:14.473 --> 18:16.217
We really don't need any more.

18:16.297 --> 18:17.659
Thank you, thank you.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.100
22,000.

18:18.581 --> 18:26.177
And he says, I think to myself, half a Japanese mushroom, and I don't mean Itake, the other.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.722
And...

18:29.039 --> 18:31.422
And so he gives 200,000 of Johnson and Wales.

18:31.442 --> 18:32.903
Well, it's not books, it's things.

18:33.043 --> 18:34.846
Well, things.

18:34.946 --> 18:36.607
Books and collectibles.

18:36.628 --> 18:37.128
Books and things.

18:37.148 --> 18:40.111
It was a presidential collection when they were just there.

18:40.131 --> 18:43.335
And so Sada still has all the rest of that.

18:43.355 --> 18:46.919
The best books could go to Iowa.

18:47.099 --> 18:48.541
The magnificent books.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.644
But they're most appreciative.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.846
So he's an amazing man.

18:53.647 --> 18:54.928
So anyway, that's how...

18:55.448 --> 18:56.790
That's how I found him.

18:56.810 --> 19:02.777
Then I went in the Abraham Lincoln bookshop and started babbling, and where she said, well, you ought to meet Louie Zathmary.

19:02.797 --> 19:05.980
In fact, I think I asked him about Zathmary.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.803
And he said, oh, yes, he's a wonderful man.

19:08.684 --> 19:12.909
And then I heard about him from Jim Donnelly of R.R.

19:12.929 --> 19:17.013
Donnelly, who knew him, too, and said, oh, my friend Louie, you ought to know about him.

19:17.194 --> 19:20.357
So finally, I just called him up out of the blue.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.920
What do we got here?

19:23.821 --> 19:24.342
R.I.P.

19:24.963 --> 19:49.300
There's one thing about collecting.

19:50.107 --> 20:04.741
I think, that leads you to organize and see categories, to see a sequence, to see things in a clump, in a group, the way libraries do, the way old librarians used to do.

20:04.801 --> 20:10.267
I wouldn't say the way modern librarians do, but the way libraries as a whole used to.

20:10.287 --> 20:16.553
That is, these 85 volumes are the collection on early children's books

20:17.174 --> 20:22.222
These 75 are the basic titles on book collectors and the like.

20:22.603 --> 20:25.708
Well, it came to the annual report for us this year.

20:26.589 --> 20:30.395
We had been active in several projects working with high school kids.

20:30.415 --> 20:40.431
We got involved with one in Detroit that pairs up ninth graders and colleges and essentially says to inner city kids,

20:42.115 --> 20:54.387
If you keep your nose clean, get a B average, 95% attendance, and 21 minimum on the ACT, you are into our college as a ninth grader.

20:54.407 --> 20:55.588
Are we a state-supported school member?

20:55.608 --> 20:57.850
No, we're private.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.875
With funding, by the time you get to college freshmen.

21:02.935 --> 21:08.961
So you know as a high school freshman you're ready to go to college for inner city kids.

21:08.981 --> 21:11.363
This is run by the guidance office in Detroit.

21:11.900 --> 21:18.496
There are 11, I think it is, public schools in Detroit that are part of this.

21:18.576 --> 21:21.523
We took a look at it once we found out about it.

21:21.744 --> 21:26.415
And we said, is there a reason in the world, here we are sitting in a private school in Illinois,

21:26.902 --> 21:30.026
We don't care that there are no other private schools involved.

21:30.046 --> 21:30.928
Why don't we do that too?

21:30.948 --> 21:33.832
They're not coming to your university for a degree.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.274
Well, they will be coming, though.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.315
This is Princeton's problem.

21:36.335 --> 21:38.759
Princeton says, what's the scope to it?

21:39.079 --> 21:42.664
They will be coming, because we agreed that we'll take them.

21:42.744 --> 21:47.972
So we've got three or four kids each year who are assigned to us and we work with, and they come visit.

21:49.313 --> 21:54.040
So then, having done that, we said to the colleges in Illinois,

21:54.526 --> 22:06.104
There are 24 or so private colleges in Illinois, and they said, if this is what some people are doing in Detroit, is there any logical reason we don't do something like this for Chicago?

22:07.185 --> 22:12.754
So it was basically my push, but I don't stress that too much.

22:13.358 --> 22:23.591
Last February, on our campus, we announced that we were going to do this with the city of Chicago, and we had 30 kids at our place this summer to get started.

22:23.611 --> 22:25.514
You got a press release on them or something?

22:25.534 --> 22:25.814
Oh, yeah.

22:25.834 --> 22:26.114
Send it to me.

22:26.134 --> 22:28.838
I'll send you a bunch of stuff about these things.

22:28.858 --> 22:32.322
Wait till you hear what's coming.

22:33.023 --> 22:35.346
So this is the old collector mentality.

22:35.506 --> 22:38.470
I mean, it just bites hard in everything I do.

22:39.972 --> 22:42.235
It's time to do our annual report.

22:43.497 --> 22:46.080
and we're one of the national liberal arts colleges.

22:47.002 --> 22:54.692
And usually a college annual report is a celebration of how wonderful you are and the most glorious adjectives you can summon up.

22:55.493 --> 22:59.458
So I particularly wanted to stress these programs we're doing with kids.

22:59.919 --> 23:02.302
What if I would have sent him just a letter with some of this?

23:02.322 --> 23:03.203
Oh, I'd love that.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.064
I'd love that.

23:04.364 --> 23:06.467
But now, now hear this out.

23:07.008 --> 23:09.251
So I said, you're going to like this.

23:09.451 --> 23:10.973
So as the old collector says,

23:11.307 --> 23:32.713
You know, we're doing our thing, and we're going to say it's great and world-shattering, but I know Occidental is doing stuff in L.A., and I'll bet every other liberal arts college is, too.

23:32.793 --> 23:33.754
So guess what?

23:34.105 --> 24:04.045
we wrote collector style to all 161 places on the national liberal arts college list and said our annual report this year is going to be a report on what the selected liberal arts colleges are doing with local corporations and local schools today to improve the quality of life in our communities without waiting for some stupid federal grant or study for a committee uh and um

24:04.261 --> 24:06.424
It's coming out on the 25th of October.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.286
Five days from now.

24:09.829 --> 24:22.666
With this annual report, and I said to myself, you know, each one of these stories sounds basically prosaic.

24:23.187 --> 24:25.470
You know, college does good, rah-rah.

24:26.771 --> 24:30.977
But I've never seen it all collected together.

24:31.548 --> 24:36.093
So we shipped it down to Mel Elfin, who's the editor of the U.S.

24:36.113 --> 24:39.035
News College issue, whom we know a little bit.

24:39.256 --> 24:40.317
I've been to see him.

24:40.337 --> 24:42.379
And I said, Mel, will you give me a read?

24:42.399 --> 24:44.281
Is this news or dull?

24:45.722 --> 24:51.528
And he wrote back, or he called back, and he said, this is really interesting stuff.

24:51.568 --> 24:54.191
We sent him a draft, you know, early zero.

24:54.211 --> 24:56.393
He said, this is really interesting stuff.

24:56.433 --> 24:57.714
Be sure to send me some more.

24:58.655 --> 25:01.538
Well, he called this morning, kind of, where the hell is it?

25:01.805 --> 25:04.148
And I said, it's going to be out in five days.

25:04.829 --> 25:07.613
And he said, well, I really want some, because I've got a plan to use it.

25:08.654 --> 25:16.605
Not for news, but some kind of project he wants to do there at the magazine for recognizing schools that are doing things with their communities.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.591
So it sounds as though he's real interested in this kind of stuff.

25:22.974 --> 25:26.479
You mentioned that your school was a private liberal arts school.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.520
I'll send you a bunch of stuff about it.

25:30.540 --> 25:33.183
So how about your attitude about books?

25:33.303 --> 25:37.289
Let's put it this way.

25:37.489 --> 25:43.938
In designing a library, God, don't get this in there, but, you know, it's just true.

25:43.958 --> 25:49.325
I have made the point again and again and again with the staff and with the faculty.

25:49.465 --> 25:55.673
I came, they had a library of about 150,000 or up to 200 or so now, I think, plus or minus.

25:56.395 --> 26:13.423
And we had a library consultant who come in, who come in, thinks he's a big gun in the library world, and a lot of people do too, and said a place like this doesn't need more than 120,000 good books with a real, you know, adjectival emphasis on good.

26:14.625 --> 26:15.807
That's actually what he said.

26:15.947 --> 26:17.149
Thank you.

26:17.169 --> 26:20.895
So I said, well, that's a very interesting observation.

26:21.176 --> 26:23.179
Let me ask you, based on that, two questions.

26:24.037 --> 26:29.183
would you, sir, like to teach at a place that had 120,000 good books?

26:29.223 --> 26:32.346
He said, well, of course not.

26:32.366 --> 26:35.670
I said, well, why do you think of any of our faculty what?

26:35.690 --> 26:40.675
And then I said, it's all very well to say we should have 120,000 good books.

26:41.296 --> 26:44.860
Riddle me, sir, please, what is a bad book we should not have?

26:44.960 --> 26:48.063
If we have too many, how do we get rid of them all?

26:48.083 --> 26:49.605
Well, this, he thought, was

26:49.906 --> 26:56.134
He's a very senior library professor, and this was like an uppity freshman asking a smart-alecky question.

26:56.334 --> 27:04.323
And I all went through him out of the office, made him rewrite his report, and frankly, I thought, bordered on the illiterate.

27:04.544 --> 27:11.492
But this is the kind of genius that's floating around in the library world that is minimizing

27:11.945 --> 27:14.770
what students will have under their fingertips to find.

27:15.170 --> 27:20.820
I mean, we find things on search machines on the computers with ease, and it's interesting and it's exciting.

27:21.361 --> 27:24.266
But there's also the element of serendipity in the library.

27:24.426 --> 27:32.099
If you pull down a book simply because of the binding or the color of the spine or importance, then you find something very interesting.

27:32.179 --> 27:37.328
I got an article in William & Mary Quarterly once simply because I pulled down a binding in Sterling Yale.

27:37.831 --> 27:40.914
I had been working on college graduations.

27:42.896 --> 27:55.928
And they always had, in the pre-revolutionary period, they always had a lot of Latin theses to be debated and questions to be answered, usually in Latin.

27:55.948 --> 28:00.192
And sometimes, word for word, the same questions on different campuses.

28:00.232 --> 28:01.854
So I wondered, how did this happen?

28:01.894 --> 28:06.218
They must, you know, plagiarism is at least 200 years old.

28:06.468 --> 28:13.116
One day in Yale, for no good reason at all, I'm just walking down a shelf, but I see a spine.

28:14.017 --> 28:14.918
And I pull it down.

28:15.318 --> 28:18.602
You know, it's like this magical thing that Glow-Owned Law has had.

28:20.023 --> 28:32.037
And all of a sudden, I find myself holding a question book for academic exercises from the 18th century by a fellow of one of the English colleges, I think.

28:32.405 --> 28:37.871
which was, word for word, the source of commencement debates at Harvard and Yale at Princeton.

28:37.911 --> 28:40.614
Four months later, it was an article in William & Herd Quarterly.

28:41.855 --> 28:43.517
The guy's name was Thomas Johnson.

28:43.557 --> 28:45.439
He was a classicist, I think, at Oxford.

28:46.380 --> 28:47.761
And I thought, this is interesting.

28:48.021 --> 28:49.863
I had no idea this book existed.

28:49.883 --> 28:57.211
I found it in a collection of three million by absolute accident, just pulling it off the shelf at Yale.

28:58.112 --> 29:01.315
If I'd gone looking in the card catalog, how would it have looked?

29:02.003 --> 29:05.146
Yale at that point had a card catalog.

29:05.166 --> 29:11.032
And I wouldn't have found it because the card for this book was not a three by five.

29:11.052 --> 29:13.415
It was a one by five.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.418
They used to have a different form.

29:16.438 --> 29:20.843
And it was a thin, thin, thin little card done in the 1870s by hand.

29:20.963 --> 29:22.144
It wasn't even typed.

29:22.905 --> 29:29.732
And it adhered to the card of the previous author so that anybody flipping through would never see it.

29:30.050 --> 29:32.532
I tell a story in my talks.

29:33.593 --> 29:37.137
The big question is, what is a culture?

29:37.898 --> 29:50.650
And if you ask that in another era in China, there will be no doubt that it is the accumulated wisdom and literary record and historical record of that culture.

29:52.852 --> 29:56.436
And thus, if you really want to know, I'll look it up.

29:56.696 --> 29:59.719
The Chinese come up with some great encyclopedia

30:00.425 --> 30:24.677
for a collection of 1,200 volumes or something, a nominal collection, of published stuff, I don't know, in the 1300s or 1400s, I mean, it's an antique itself now, but this was a compilation of virtual, all-known documents, so that the culture used to be essentially identified

30:25.433 --> 30:26.435
as its library.

30:26.475 --> 30:41.639
But the interesting thing about archives and about the broader space collections is, if you think only for today, you think of the collections in a very practical way that students, you think, are going to ask tomorrow morning.

30:42.841 --> 30:52.757
If you think of the Athenaeum, we bought it for use there, you are thinking of the potential questions that will come up in the next two centuries.

30:53.378 --> 31:09.560
A culture with a sense of itself and the kind of cultural resources that China and Japan and England have had have been willing to plan for two or three or four centuries.

31:09.720 --> 31:17.571
If a staircase is six centuries old at Oxford, it is not classified as out of date.

31:17.811 --> 31:22.137
It is simply venerable and respected accordingly.

31:23.129 --> 31:27.374
though it possibly wouldn't pass OSHA standards in this country.

31:28.275 --> 31:48.300
The point is that we may venerate now and seek eagerly, as many historians do, anything about black poets or black musicians in the 18th century or even 19th century.

31:49.081 --> 31:52.005
But if somebody in 1910

31:52.542 --> 31:59.793
threw it out as kind of trivial trash, that no one will ever be interested in this, we can't find it.

32:00.654 --> 32:07.444
And all too often, we find we have one of the two or three known copies.

32:07.604 --> 32:16.137
An interesting thing, even as a collector myself, is to go to the National Union catalog or some database via the electronic accredited

32:16.471 --> 32:20.635
And you ask, how many other copies of this are there?

32:20.755 --> 32:26.860
Now, you have to assume there's a certain factor floating around in private hands in addition to what's in the public of known collections.

32:27.961 --> 32:41.273
But when you find you have something that's only in two other libraries in the country, or perhaps no library in the United States, or you have a British piece that's nowhere in this country.

32:41.493 --> 32:46.377
And you have things in your possession?

32:47.065 --> 32:49.708
I have one that I think may be the only known copy.

32:50.369 --> 32:50.969
What's that?

32:50.989 --> 33:00.821
Well, it's religious poems or meditations of an English author that was reprinted many times in America.

33:01.021 --> 33:11.533
But it's an interesting story that I got this, I think, in a group that Boutwell got from the American Antiquarian Society of, you know, dated books that they had duplicates to.

33:12.935 --> 33:15.958
Well, I don't know why I looked this one up.

33:17.272 --> 33:27.621
Uh, but the, uh, at Aquarian was the only one to have a copy of this.

33:28.482 --> 33:30.083
And guess what?

33:30.103 --> 33:36.209
The copy I bought has all the same fly marks and ink blots as the one that's on the microcard.

33:37.610 --> 33:43.275
So I've got the one that's on the microcard, and whether they still, I mean, it's not something, any luck.

33:43.315 --> 33:46.418
When did the chapter just call it?

33:46.820 --> 33:50.725
Yeah, this is probably in the latter years of Marcus McCorrison, right?

33:50.745 --> 33:52.127
1980, 1982, or something like that.

33:52.207 --> 33:56.172
No, that sounds actually better back in argument.

33:56.192 --> 33:56.293
Yeah.

33:56.373 --> 34:00.037
Very arrogant then, Marcus.

34:00.057 --> 34:00.859
Arrogance, you see.

34:00.939 --> 34:03.662
It's arrogance, isn't it?

34:03.682 --> 34:09.570
Well, if it's arrogance in defense of the culture, then it's something that should be encouraged.

34:10.192 --> 34:16.687
But when it is somebody who says, I stand in judgment of a culture as a librarian and saying this we will have, this we won't.

34:16.707 --> 34:19.233
And you don't think that's intellectual fascism?

34:19.253 --> 34:20.556
Well, in a sense it is.

34:21.438 --> 34:22.761
In every way we have to do it.

34:23.503 --> 34:27.171
That is, if I know I can order a hundred books this year.

34:27.556 --> 34:55.572
um there's a bit of the same thing in adding books that is what do i choose to add out of the thousands of things i could pick which hundred are worthy of being known by the students because i chose them um you try to not personalize it so much but when you're deaccessioning things you have to realize you do it for centuries not just for this week's show okay well have you doing session things that you're i try not to i've died

34:56.024 --> 34:59.990
Do you have the final word?

35:01.212 --> 35:06.720
If I find out about it, probably, because I'm, you know, at the far end of the administrative chain.

35:07.701 --> 35:08.703
Do they know your attitude?

35:08.883 --> 35:09.644
They certainly do.

35:10.185 --> 35:19.939
And I think I have worked with the faculty to get the faculty to say, please share my attitude toward this

35:20.780 --> 35:33.199
a library consultant we have, we want a library that's serious, and that means 400,000 on-the-shelf volumes at minimum for the students and for us to use.

35:33.219 --> 35:41.572
Now, there are some librarians, I've known in a couple of contexts, who say faculty already have PhDs, they don't need books.

35:41.592 --> 35:46.500
Believe it or not, I've heard that about professional librarians a long time ago.

35:46.919 --> 35:53.451
I've also heard it said, well, if the book doesn't circulate in five years, then we shouldn't have it.

35:53.471 --> 35:55.294
We should or we shouldn't.

35:55.394 --> 35:55.895
Should not.

35:55.935 --> 35:59.001
Unless that shows it's useless.

35:59.422 --> 36:06.134
Since I just thought it up, it may go nowhere.

36:06.154 --> 36:08.438
There's a great concern with genetic diversity.

36:09.194 --> 36:13.900
There are many major seed companies like... What's the word seed?

36:14.160 --> 36:16.603
Seed, as in, you know, plant a bean.

36:16.703 --> 36:18.846
Okay, yeah.

36:18.906 --> 36:22.010
You're a very good interviewer for your tape recorder, I've noticed, by the way.

36:22.030 --> 36:22.691
Spell the word.

36:22.751 --> 36:24.113
What word was this?

36:24.714 --> 36:26.095
Okay, I mean, you learn.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.537
It could be seed.

36:27.637 --> 36:30.561
I could spend 20 minutes trying to figure that word out.

36:31.402 --> 36:33.045
Burpee sells seeds.

36:33.406 --> 36:45.107
It sells seeds to kids who want to, kids, little old ladies, lawyers who want to grow the best and quickest and easiest, the largest and most tasty cucumbers.

36:45.340 --> 36:47.986
They don't want to screw around with some exotic rare thing.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.351
They just want the easiest cucumber they can grow.

36:50.992 --> 36:54.660
So every year they may offer 10 or 15 cucumber varieties.

36:54.741 --> 37:05.003
And if you look back at seed catalogs of the sort I've got listed there, you'll see that almost none of those offered in 1910 or 20 or 1890 are available today.

37:05.708 --> 37:15.783
Well, if you want an 1860s-type tomato, and it's genetic material, so it's got to keep growing and growing and growing, or it just withers and dies, where are you going to get one?

37:17.105 --> 37:22.253
There is a genetics bank, I think, in Colorado for seed types.

37:22.313 --> 37:24.276
There's another one in Geneva, New York.

37:25.017 --> 37:33.690
But the big trade is out of Seed Savers Exchange, a group in Decorah, Iowa, which has...

37:34.328 --> 37:41.218
a network of about 11,000 people, I think it is, who subscribe to this.

37:41.438 --> 38:00.184
And if you want beans or corn or any kind of vegetable at all, you could write to one of these people directly, say somebody in Ontario or Florida or Oregon, and they will send you a packet of seeds of this exotic strain

38:00.670 --> 38:03.375
that you can't get at all in the commercial market.

38:03.395 --> 38:05.460
Some of them you can, but most of them you can't.

38:06.943 --> 38:20.029
And in a weird way, I almost sense libraries going much the same, that where there are thousands and thousands and thousands of things published each year,

38:20.549 --> 38:25.213
The mandate of a state university is to serve the needs of those right in front.

38:25.393 --> 38:28.216
I know we're not talking about Cornell.

38:28.356 --> 38:29.137
Right.

38:29.497 --> 38:37.525
But if you say, well, Mr. Bazbaines, you come and see us once every 84 years, that's a bit of a luxury.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.926
We just can't afford to do that.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.127
Well, I resent that.

38:40.587 --> 38:42.709
Yeah, I do, too.

38:43.510 --> 38:45.292
Thank God it was there.

38:45.932 --> 38:48.094
Because it wouldn't be in my book if it wasn't.

38:48.154 --> 38:50.016
Many private collectors

38:52.240 --> 38:56.204
And things like the Athenaeum are like the Seed Savers Exchange.

38:56.224 --> 39:05.732
They are preserving intact what Burpee is no longer sending out in the seed packets because they've got something else they've got to sell to the kind of market they serve.

39:06.573 --> 39:15.140
And I never thought of the collector as a kind of bibliographic resource and preservationist resource to the nation.

39:15.160 --> 39:21.606
But I think the more people read what you write, what other people write, and they hear these horror tales,

39:22.666 --> 39:30.700
about people who give great collections to major institutions thinking they will be forever preserved.

39:33.084 --> 39:34.707
They're just going to think twice about that.

39:34.727 --> 39:35.448
Do you know Cornell at all?

39:36.249 --> 39:48.150
Well, I was provost at Hobart for five years, so... Say that, cultural literacy, the role of a library, the role of a...

39:50.425 --> 39:58.035
a university, a public library, and frankly, a private book collector as a cultural force.

39:58.096 --> 40:01.220
I'd never thought about that way.

40:02.562 --> 40:03.323
No.

40:04.725 --> 40:11.234
The Japanese noble, the samurai, the noble families of Japan would have libraries.

40:11.314 --> 40:15.219
They would see themselves as preservers of culture for themselves.

40:15.339 --> 40:18.103
You go to the great country houses in England,

40:18.455 --> 40:35.102
And here are these huge, noble, wonderful libraries that go on and on and on for yards and yards and yards, as though they all saw themselves to a degree as a mini version of the British Museum or their own college.

40:37.206 --> 40:41.813
Again, you go back to Addison.

40:42.569 --> 40:51.739
in his essay on coins and medals in the early 18th century, when he simply says, this is what a gentleman should have in a well-appointed library.

40:58.346 --> 41:09.859
In the hands of some people who are in your book, here are people who are preserving a little fragment or a very pointed fragment of culture

41:10.261 --> 41:12.844
It may be African-Americans in the South.

41:12.864 --> 41:15.547
It may be Czechs in Chicago.

41:16.648 --> 41:20.753
With Louis Zatmeri, there was Hungarian-American relations.

41:21.794 --> 41:29.263
I mean, he himself preserved a chunk of that story that any institution would be lucky to have.

41:29.283 --> 41:30.825
Well, and they're all thrilled to have it, too.

41:33.448 --> 41:34.429
But he collected it.

41:34.649 --> 41:35.110
They didn't.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.112
But you know what bothers them?

41:37.784 --> 41:40.950
What if 50 years from now, nobody's interested in those books?

41:42.613 --> 41:48.744
That's where the private collector reemerges, to keep picking up the pieces, as long as they're allowed to be in the circuit.

41:49.285 --> 41:51.890
And there was a teacher there who says, oh, I don't care if you teach this.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.074
So nobody touches this stuff.

41:54.695 --> 41:56.819
So some hotshot says, well, let's get rid of it.

41:56.839 --> 41:58.442
We could use the space.

41:58.945 --> 42:06.993
and they sell it, or they give it to Roland Balbo, who even sends it to the dump, or gives it to somebody.

42:07.093 --> 42:09.115
Or if I get it, then the process continues.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.437
That's a happy consequence.

42:11.457 --> 42:17.183
But that's not the way it's supposed to work, I don't think.

42:17.203 --> 42:17.623
I don't know.

42:17.703 --> 42:25.390
People think that they give something to an institution that is going to be forever preserved.

42:25.430 --> 42:27.012
They're making a leap of faith

42:28.527 --> 42:34.993
Well, the whole question of what it means to be in a library is quite interesting.

42:35.033 --> 42:38.636
Those who think, well, every book has to be in super condition.

42:38.656 --> 42:40.878
It has to have a fancy binding on it.

42:40.898 --> 42:41.479
No, of course not.

42:41.619 --> 42:45.222
But that's really not a productive one, is it?

42:45.262 --> 42:51.327
Librarians, it's as though they go to national conventions and they lose points big time.

42:51.928 --> 42:56.492
If there are any books that have flaky spines or broken bindings,

42:58.278 --> 43:04.128
So tell me about all of your books, all of these things you told me about tonight.

43:06.812 --> 43:12.061
Is it a synergistic kind of a collection?

43:12.081 --> 43:16.368
Do they all come together and produce something that is greater than the sum of its parts?

43:18.351 --> 43:19.333
Well, they do for me.

43:20.375 --> 43:24.842
And I know about all these diverse little things.

43:25.767 --> 43:27.851
People sometimes say, how do you know about that?

43:27.911 --> 43:28.912
How do you know about that?

43:29.934 --> 43:31.597
And my answer is, oh, I have a book about it.

43:32.198 --> 43:34.482
You know, it sits on this shelf or it sits on that shelf.

43:37.107 --> 43:44.399
And if you just look at a lot of the things you have, pay even minimal attention to them.

43:44.419 --> 43:45.822
You learn wondrous things.

43:45.842 --> 43:48.487
But do they all reinforce each other?

43:48.527 --> 43:49.328
Not a bit.

43:52.649 --> 43:59.778
In my own mind, the cookery goes vaguely with the music, but that's not a connection most people would make apart from the time.

44:02.381 --> 44:07.747
Well, you used the word vaguely.

44:07.767 --> 44:12.112
Do you have any vague thoughts of what this collection is and what happens to it?

44:14.695 --> 44:16.498
I mean, what's going to happen after I'm done with it?

44:16.538 --> 44:17.098
I haven't a clue.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.142
I haven't even thought about that.

44:20.830 --> 44:22.592
talking with you and get very depressed.

44:23.454 --> 44:27.239
You know, what I have to hope is that a child or grandchild might be interested in it.

44:27.259 --> 44:28.781
That doesn't always happen.

44:28.861 --> 44:31.004
Somebody has some use for it.

44:31.024 --> 44:34.930
I mean, you know, you rescued so many of these things on the way to the dump.

44:34.950 --> 44:36.672
There's a completely different philosophy.

44:38.355 --> 44:44.904
And it was shared by... It seems to say that when you're telling them, they will once again be found for the dump.

44:44.924 --> 44:49.150
Well, unless they're parceled out through dealers or auctions.

44:49.383 --> 45:14.682
to those similar to me who want them i have a friend who had a very impressive collection of medals and decorations and he's he's very much in health lives in new york city but he sold a lot of it at one point and his attitude was it's not going to an institution very well could have gone to american numismatic society or the smithsonian a lot of it but

45:14.948 --> 45:18.473
that he'd had a lot of fun with it, and he wanted other collectors to have fun with it.

45:19.074 --> 45:21.418
He wrote a bunch of books based on it, too.

45:22.940 --> 45:27.286
Why are people so quick to send things off to the dump, to the landfill?

45:27.307 --> 45:28.288
To the dump?

45:28.308 --> 45:33.596
To the dump, to the landfill, to the, you know, wherever things go.

45:33.836 --> 45:41.648
Well, they don't know what they are, and don't care, and don't realize how interesting what they have could be to someone else.

45:43.028 --> 45:48.115
I'll give you a bizarre example of just that, right in my own house.

45:51.721 --> 46:06.943
My families, some came from New England, but my mother's family came from Minneapolis, by way of New England and other places, some of them.

46:10.248 --> 46:23.807
My, what is it, great, great uncle was named George Duvall, who was the author of 40 Years a Gambler on the Mississippi, a life as a riverboat gambler.

46:23.847 --> 46:29.455
And my grandmother even had some oral tradition about that man, I'd ask.

46:29.772 --> 46:51.071
She'd poo-poo him because, you know, it isn't nice to be a gambler, and you don't want to be a gambler, and it's not a thing to be, and this is embarrassing to the family, and he'd come home and he'd tell all these lies and tall tales about what he did, and one time he'd have a whole bunch of diamonds, and another time he'd have nothing, and that man was really kind of a bum, et cetera, et cetera.

46:51.311 --> 46:52.592
All right.

46:52.612 --> 46:53.573
Well, he published a book.

46:54.274 --> 46:55.295
The book was reprinted.

46:55.415 --> 46:57.336
I have a ratty copy of the original.

46:57.416 --> 46:59.138
I mean, really ratty, no covers.

46:59.658 --> 47:03.862
all broken up, but it's there, and a copy of the reprint.

47:03.922 --> 47:05.864
That's chapter one.

47:05.964 --> 47:10.288
Chapter two is we have an alum who is class of 67.

47:10.548 --> 47:11.789
He's a writer.

47:12.030 --> 47:13.051
His name is Dennis Brown.

47:13.071 --> 47:18.236
He writes for screenplays, but he's also interested in the Mississippi, so he came out to see me.

47:20.558 --> 47:27.184
And we were talking about this and that, and he was telling me that he's now going off to ride on one of the riverboats, and that's nice, so

47:27.704 --> 47:29.467
We thought about that.

47:29.667 --> 47:34.374
And then Dennis said, he was talking about this.

47:34.454 --> 47:37.198
I said, Dennis, did you ever hear of the gambler George Duvall?

47:37.638 --> 47:39.581
He said, oh, yes, he's very famous.

47:39.601 --> 47:43.787
He's the only one of those guys ever who wrote an account of his life.

47:43.827 --> 47:46.071
So it's a very important book.

47:46.091 --> 47:48.354
He said, you know, but there's one thing about him.

47:48.654 --> 47:50.437
Nobody's ever found a picture of him.

47:52.300 --> 47:56.125
I said, you're kidding.

47:57.320 --> 47:58.942
He said, yeah.

47:59.042 --> 48:02.365
I mean, for all of this, there's a, you know, there's a woodcut of it.

48:02.385 --> 48:06.289
But you'd think living even into the 20th century, there'd be a photograph.

48:06.489 --> 48:07.050
What do you think?

48:08.111 --> 48:09.032
That there'd be two.

48:10.794 --> 48:11.294
Right.

48:12.155 --> 48:13.977
You know, the pictures would have survived.

48:13.997 --> 48:24.728
Nick, I have two from my grandmother and a picture of his wife that he said no one has, you know, we've heard he had a wife, but no one's ever seen a picture of her.

48:25.113 --> 48:26.114
I had them myself.

48:26.194 --> 48:27.075
It never occurred to me.

48:27.095 --> 48:29.278
These were, you know, even in slightest interest.

48:29.378 --> 48:30.439
They're just family pictures.

48:31.060 --> 48:40.391
Scott Turrell of this city, who I went to be, a friend of mine, I know him, who's worked.

48:40.971 --> 48:47.779
I told him about, you know, how you can get a degree in English literature from Georgetown University without ever having to study Shakespeare.

48:47.980 --> 48:48.640
You've heard of this.

48:49.622 --> 48:51.564
Scott told me, I can do you one better than that.

48:51.604 --> 48:52.605
I was at a dinner.

48:52.771 --> 49:11.608
at Amherst College with the president, Tom Garrity, when he was informed that they had just graduated a summa cum laude in English from Amherst College, and the individual had never taken a course in Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, and Spencer at Garrity's job practice, and he did that.

49:11.668 --> 49:13.890
Do you have any kind of a response?

49:13.910 --> 49:17.933
I have a two-level response on that.

49:17.953 --> 49:21.917
That certainly it's important

49:22.454 --> 49:27.219
that such things be there and that kids be able to take them.

49:27.239 --> 49:36.389
But I went through a debate once at Connecticut College on whether or not the philosophy department could drop its course on Plato.

49:36.429 --> 49:38.171
Plato and Aristotle, I think it was.

49:38.191 --> 49:40.013
Now, this was a rather strange time.

49:40.814 --> 49:42.676
I don't know if they do this anymore.

49:42.836 --> 49:45.659
Late 70s or early 80s.

49:45.739 --> 49:48.242
It was not the 60s and early 70s.

49:49.977 --> 49:56.646
Yeah, yeah, and they said kids aren't taking this course.

49:57.527 --> 50:02.093
It was not at that point mandatory, and we just don't have the enrollment.

50:02.313 --> 50:03.455
Is it okay if we drop it?

50:03.495 --> 50:12.627
And the faculty, the only time I can remember we ever did this, voted no, the philosophy department may not drop the course.

50:13.096 --> 50:20.685
which the faculty had the power to say, well, okay, they continued to offer it, and two or three or four kids, five kids would take it.

50:21.345 --> 50:29.755
So honor was served, but basically there were three kids who took Plato and Aristotle, and a foreigner that didn't.

50:29.775 --> 50:31.957
Yeah, but let me ask, let me take it to the next level.

50:32.117 --> 50:40.707
Would you, as a college president, allow a degree in philosophy to a student who had not studied Aristotle or Plato?

50:42.526 --> 50:49.156
probably wouldn't because Aristotle and Plato are incorporated in virtually every course we teach.

50:49.296 --> 51:04.720
So that the kid who never had a course in Milton or Shakespeare certainly had some acquaintance with Shakespeare one way or another, whether the course was taught Shakespeare, comedy, Shakespeare, you know.

51:04.970 --> 51:07.673
But then again, you've got to ask this.

51:07.733 --> 51:10.657
Let's just listen to your discourse tonight.

51:10.717 --> 51:12.500
You talked about Elizabeth Bishop.

51:13.160 --> 51:20.670
You talked about Our Lady of Amherst there, Emily Dickinson.

51:21.431 --> 51:24.134
There was a time these people weren't in the curriculum at all.

51:24.334 --> 51:26.337
Are these worthy of putting in the curriculum?

51:26.468 --> 51:30.937
I think the canon is a constantly evolving way of the king.

51:30.957 --> 51:33.522
That's what's so interesting about academic history.

51:33.582 --> 51:38.371
I've got a 1912, 1910 or 12 Hamilton catalog.

51:38.491 --> 51:40.936
And let me tell you, these boys took the gloves off.

51:40.956 --> 51:43.060
It is the most vigorous, wonderful catalog.

51:43.259 --> 51:50.067
It says, Hamilton does not offer a cafeteria program like so many other colleges in America.

51:50.147 --> 51:53.270
Hamilton will maintain its standards to the end of time.

51:54.011 --> 52:02.101
And, I mean, you've just got to say, god damn, they're not going to let those standards fall through Hamilton.

52:02.121 --> 52:10.330
But my point is, you call it degree literature, but don't, you call it English literature.

52:11.170 --> 52:29.254
Well, there's political correctness, but there was a different kind before.

52:29.635 --> 52:30.276
Don't forget that.

52:31.157 --> 52:32.098
Until

52:32.838 --> 52:39.828
About, I would say, 1970, it was considered untoward to teach any novels after 1914.

52:39.988 --> 52:44.935
That is simply, you know, modern trash that kids will read as amusement.

52:44.955 --> 52:49.322
Nobody read Joyce when I went to Bates, that I know of.

52:49.882 --> 52:58.074
One of the reasons Yale emerged is that Harvard wasn't teaching the right stuff, and you keep going that way.

52:58.335 --> 53:00.077
I can't defend ignoring

53:00.766 --> 53:04.414
the great central canon around which things work.

53:04.434 --> 53:07.600
And that's an interesting and political correct question itself.

53:08.302 --> 53:12.471
Many people will say there is no canon at all.

53:12.731 --> 53:16.058
You know, in past pains, you keep talking about all these ancient books.

53:16.443 --> 53:19.908
and there's no canon, you've just got to get with a modern world and read that.

53:19.988 --> 53:23.353
And here are the 12 books that will explain that to you if you don't know it.

53:23.373 --> 53:24.255
Now think about that.

53:24.615 --> 53:33.288
There's no canon, but here are the 12 standard books that, I mean, there's just a substitution of one list for another.

53:36.072 --> 53:39.177
That's why the Chevalier Saint-Georges is so important.

53:40.355 --> 53:46.383
Because what some places would like to do is say to the answer to that question is yes.

53:47.145 --> 53:50.369
Because it has excluded women.

53:50.469 --> 53:51.711
It has excluded blacks.

53:51.731 --> 53:54.815
It has excluded any group I want to know.

53:55.476 --> 53:57.379
It's an interesting question to go to Jamaica.

53:57.439 --> 53:58.941
Does the 18th century exist?

54:00.143 --> 54:02.406
Is that like talking about the Dark Ages?

54:02.606 --> 54:04.188
Is this part of Jamaican history?

54:04.549 --> 54:06.191
Here's something I'm thinking about doing.

54:06.231 --> 54:09.636
If I could play better, and maybe even if I can't,

54:10.342 --> 54:13.065
I love antiquarian stuff.

54:13.405 --> 54:14.807
I have a music manuscript.

54:15.187 --> 54:22.114
I don't know if I told you this, that it was arguably the oldest known American secular music that I just picked up in Goodspeed one day, 1744.

54:22.155 --> 54:26.699
That was 10 bucks, right?

54:26.719 --> 54:27.100
No, 250.

54:27.120 --> 54:27.700
Big spending.

54:28.521 --> 54:33.987
It's a manuscript of a harpsichord teacher who later went to Williamsburg, Peter Powell.

54:34.439 --> 54:37.784
His teacher was Johann Pachelbel's son.

54:37.944 --> 54:41.470
Pachelbel was a great contemporary of J.S.

54:41.490 --> 54:41.831
Bach.

54:42.992 --> 54:49.042
One of his sons was in this country, was organist in Charleston, died in 1750.

54:50.885 --> 55:00.700
Just before I went to Jamaica, I realized, again, just dumb luck to find this, Pachelbel's other kid,

55:01.338 --> 55:03.881
played a concert in Kingston, Jamaica, 1728.

55:03.982 --> 55:04.202
Wow.

55:04.903 --> 55:05.864
Wow.

55:06.024 --> 55:10.691
I mean, why should I find this two days before I go to Kingston?

55:10.731 --> 55:13.214
So I go down there, and I say, do you know anything about this?

55:13.274 --> 55:14.195
Nope, never heard of it.

55:14.296 --> 55:15.677
I'm concerned that you have to go home.

55:15.697 --> 55:15.998
Yeah.

55:16.639 --> 55:26.472
Well, the whole point is that here, you see, I could go down there, and with some friends, we could play the Chevalier Saint-Georges.

55:26.492 --> 55:27.093
You're down where?

55:27.153 --> 55:27.573
Jamaica?

55:27.594 --> 55:27.854
Yeah.

55:28.274 --> 55:30.197
We could play Chevalier Saint-Georges.

55:30.515 --> 55:46.313
we could play Ignacio Sanchez and say, look, the 18th century is not alien territory if you're of African descent, because they aren't well known, because you haven't been paying attention to them, but there are some spectacular people taking part in that tradition right then when it happened.

55:46.850 --> 55:54.557
I sense that you really don't have a... this whole thing about the Western canon and stuff like that.

55:55.659 --> 55:58.181
It's a tough question, isn't it?

55:58.201 --> 56:01.364
Well, it is and it isn't, because I'm a believer in Asia, too.

56:01.384 --> 56:03.786
Because you really didn't answer the question directly.

56:04.067 --> 56:05.949
No, no, and you won't get that from me.

56:05.969 --> 56:08.211
I'm not going to say every kid has to take Shakespeare.

56:08.491 --> 56:12.655
Well, but if you're an English major, that was the context of the question.

56:12.972 --> 56:14.033
English literature.

56:14.514 --> 56:15.876
You're purporting to be a nation.

56:16.577 --> 56:24.407
I'm not going to tell the professors of English you've got to read Shakespeare rather than Milton, and Milton rather than Congreve, and Congreve rather than Dryden.

56:24.447 --> 56:26.230
That's their department.

56:26.250 --> 56:29.294
Pick that stuff out.

56:29.554 --> 56:36.904
I just brought, over the weekend, a folio.

56:38.032 --> 57:00.377
heroic poem on the last judgment in the manner of milton 1714 i started reading one page and i said i can see why this is a pristine copy but that's it's in each year in each era the literature we read is what appeals to us

57:00.813 --> 57:03.496
Shakespeare sometimes is a tough go to me.

57:05.198 --> 57:08.522
Sometimes I listen to it and it does fall trippingly on the ear.

57:09.183 --> 57:12.467
Other times I wonder, this is a little bit rough go.

57:13.468 --> 57:17.713
A lot of 18th century theater doesn't appeal to a lot of people.

57:17.733 --> 57:19.755
But on the other hand, J.S.

57:19.856 --> 57:22.098
Bach was completely forgotten.

57:22.118 --> 57:24.441
I don't think he was published at all in England.

57:24.826 --> 57:29.193
and wasn't revived until the Mendelssohn efforts in the 1900s.

57:29.233 --> 57:33.620
He just didn't fit the taste of the times.

57:33.640 --> 57:41.233
And what's taste and what's truth is always in the balance every academic generation.

57:41.253 --> 57:42.615
Good question.
