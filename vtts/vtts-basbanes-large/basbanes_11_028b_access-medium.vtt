WEBVTT

00:03.912 --> 00:20.879
I would like to say no, because I was inquadrati in an esercito britannico in a way that they were in charge, because they had a lot of commensals, so they didn't want to dispense that they couldn't do it.

00:20.939 --> 00:24.385
When they asked the general Frieser, they asked the second argument,

00:24.365 --> 00:41.226
So it was really, he said that the New Zealander, the General from New Zealand was really the person that ordered the family.

00:41.459 --> 01:01.273
In the first time in February, they were in the mountains to cross the mountain, there was a small fiume, an affluente fiume galiliano, and at the first night, some of the centenari of the country of Texas.

01:01.490 --> 01:26.839
There was a lot of deaths in the first half of February in front of the Allied troops.

01:26.819 --> 01:40.819
and I have to tell you that we have a region of Italy, in the morning of the club in the South America, there is a photograph of a terrible photograph, there is a pazzia, and all the finestre with the swastika tedeschi, because in the old monastery there is no one.

01:40.959 --> 01:43.042
Ah, they did a photo.

01:43.383 --> 01:44.605
They did a photo.

01:45.386 --> 01:46.728
No, they did a photo.

01:46.748 --> 01:48.330
They did a photo.

01:48.430 --> 01:49.351
They did a photo.

01:49.372 --> 01:49.952
No, they did a photo.

01:49.972 --> 01:50.413
They did a photo.

01:50.393 --> 02:02.707
Yeah, like they had swastikas on it, but it was fake, the Americans, you know, to justify the bombing, to say that there were Germans in here.

02:03.348 --> 02:16.924
Swastika.

02:17.039 --> 02:30.691
Oh, it wasn't a photograph, it was a person.

02:34.194 --> 02:39.299
Oh, they wanted it to stop again?

02:39.339 --> 02:42.282
I don't know.

02:42.462 --> 02:47.046
Yeah, but I don't think that...

02:47.026 --> 02:51.031
No, no, no, it was like a drawing.

02:51.051 --> 02:52.893
A cartoon?

02:54.995 --> 03:01.643
Yeah, a cartoon.

03:02.644 --> 03:13.337
Well, propaganda di guerra.

03:14.768 --> 03:30.468
They took 12, the Germans did evacuate all the 300 of the 1500.

03:31.350 --> 03:38.599
What did they help?

03:38.579 --> 03:44.727
Ah, so the remaining ones, the route was no longer safe to take away them.

03:44.807 --> 03:50.715
So they could try to take them out.

03:50.875 --> 04:00.267
And also the room is there.

04:00.517 --> 04:25.360
This was the manuscript that they took to the opening of the paper.

04:25.340 --> 04:41.274
It's quite nice.

04:41.655 --> 04:53.946
It's a 10th century memory.

04:54.348 --> 04:55.491
That's the 10th century range.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.916
All right.

04:57.957 --> 05:04.091
All right.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.755
All right.

05:05.915 --> 05:08.802
All right.

05:11.047 --> 05:13.032
All right.

05:13.012 --> 05:19.446
From Belgium, bombing, that kind of thing.

05:19.566 --> 05:27.784
Oh, the twenty-one, the twenty-one, the twenty-one, the twenty-one books.

05:27.904 --> 05:32.995
And this, for example, ends in the 11th, begins in the 12th, and the 12th.

05:32.975 --> 05:55.219
... ... ... ... ...

05:55.199 --> 05:59.787
The meaning is to nourish.

06:02.591 --> 06:16.735
Yes, thinking of all the animals, the land, I know.

06:16.715 --> 06:35.922
This is where the theater was created, the theater, the theater, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art, the art,

06:40.441 --> 06:51.158
This is what?

06:53.862 --> 07:07.444
This is a... That is very important.

07:15.389 --> 07:19.595
Can I get a picture of you, Father?

07:19.635 --> 07:19.895
Like this?

07:21.638 --> 07:29.830
Actually, if I could just shoot long like this, too.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.472
And maybe those books, too, Lucy.

07:31.492 --> 07:35.377
I just want to shoot long, that way I can get that portrait in the background, too.

07:35.638 --> 07:36.799
Maybe your bag, do you mind?

07:40.645 --> 07:42.287
This is such a terrific picture.

07:42.347 --> 07:42.848
There he is.

07:45.595 --> 07:49.440
That's excellent.

07:49.460 --> 07:49.660
Thank you.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.401
That's the rule?

07:51.642 --> 08:06.981
That's the rule of Benedict?

08:09.885 --> 08:11.687
So this is...

08:11.853 --> 08:29.295
So this book here is a thousand years old?

08:29.355 --> 08:29.695
Yes.

08:29.916 --> 08:36.524
That's pretty exciting, isn't it?

08:37.565 --> 08:39.828
I like this one.

08:39.848 --> 08:40.729
All right, let's see.

08:41.468 --> 08:59.032
And the way I should wash it, I'll just push that one.

08:59.934 --> 09:10.328
That was pretty exciting, a 10th century copy of the rule.

09:11.422 --> 09:34.341
... ... ... ... ...

09:34.473 --> 09:54.675
That's what you said.

09:55.465 --> 10:00.031
Oh, this is exciting.

10:03.856 --> 10:15.953
Oh, this is exciting.

10:17.435 --> 10:21.861
Oh, this is exciting.

10:22.263 --> 10:33.518
1023, down here.

10:38.124 --> 10:41.588
How much?

10:41.905 --> 10:59.458
So between 40,000 and 50,000 Americans have got six, 10 million dollars.

10:59.438 --> 11:00.660
It's a chorus.

11:01.862 --> 11:08.351
That's which is the oldest?

11:08.812 --> 11:16.583
The oldest message they have.

11:16.603 --> 11:22.071
So that's...

11:22.608 --> 11:26.532
What was the time here?

11:26.552 --> 11:31.798
The age of the three, so clear.

11:31.818 --> 11:33.620
What was the time here?

11:33.640 --> 11:39.247
The age of the three, so clear.

11:39.267 --> 11:49.358
The age of the three, so clear.

11:49.338 --> 12:05.980
So these are the thoughts of Saint Isidore, who are the Spanish Saint.

12:07.743 --> 12:10.907
Oh, look at that, that's the last one.

12:12.541 --> 12:20.970
So, ask me if they were produced here, in Maticusia.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.071
Yeah, they go.

12:22.472 --> 12:24.514
This is the case.

12:24.854 --> 12:29.419
This is the base of the myth of the 11th century.

12:29.439 --> 12:32.042
Now, you see the selection of the Ethics with the concept of this.

12:32.062 --> 12:33.964
In the rule, there is the original myth of the 11th century.

12:33.984 --> 12:36.186
This is the fact that the myth is the myth of the 11th century.

12:36.166 --> 12:43.157
So this is where the dedication page shows the Athens giving this manuscript to St.

12:43.257 --> 12:45.100
Benedict.

12:45.201 --> 12:55.377
So that's how they traditionally did the dedication pages, the abbot offering the books to St.

12:55.437 --> 12:56.098
Benedict.

12:56.838 --> 12:58.440
I'll get a picture of that.

12:58.520 --> 13:05.811
This is the book of the writing of the St.

13:06.171 --> 13:09.376
Gregory the Great, 11th century.

13:10.397 --> 13:12.880
This is an 8th century manuscript, late 8th?

13:13.161 --> 13:15.564
Yes, and it's the thoughts of St.

13:15.704 --> 13:19.790
Isidore, who was a Spanish saint.

13:21.272 --> 13:22.314
8th century.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.196
8th century, 9th century.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.478
Done here, done here too.

13:25.643 --> 13:33.561
It's been here for, not only is it that old, it's here.

13:33.721 --> 13:34.543
It's where it was done.

13:35.505 --> 13:37.510
And that's a presentation book.

13:37.777 --> 13:59.650
This is what we expect a few years from the 10th century.

13:59.630 --> 14:21.357
Well, yes, because Salerno, which is not far from the first pharmaceutical and medical school in Europe or in the Netherlands.

14:24.781 --> 14:24.861
Yes.

14:24.841 --> 14:41.901
They had books about medicine so they could take care of the children.

14:42.041 --> 14:51.912
Yeah, they had to take care of the domestic care in pilgrimage.

14:52.415 --> 15:03.974
Galen, right?

15:09.823 --> 15:16.414
Galen, yes.

15:17.558 --> 15:18.319
He was the first.

15:20.183 --> 15:38.436
You can stand by.

15:38.990 --> 15:59.792
I was born in New York.

16:00.132 --> 16:08.541
My mother had a brownstone.

16:09.432 --> 16:23.496
Morgan Library.

16:23.796 --> 16:26.481
He went to the Morgan Library.

16:26.501 --> 16:30.087
These numbers are all... Oh, this went to the Morgan Library?

16:30.207 --> 16:30.848
No, no.

16:31.209 --> 16:33.853
He went.

16:34.441 --> 16:47.921
But when he went back to get the three manuscripts from the Byzantine exhibition, he went to visit the modern library.

16:48.962 --> 17:01.140
Ask me, these numbers, if I go to the catalog, they will identify all of these books.

17:01.120 --> 17:13.075
If I go to the catalog, 127 will identify this book.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.817
Yes.

17:14.837 --> 17:22.106
Like 127.

17:22.266 --> 17:29.895
He's writing down the name of the catalog.

17:30.803 --> 17:31.404
Oh, good.

17:31.424 --> 17:33.306
Yes, excellent.

17:33.326 --> 17:39.835
I can get that in Boston.

17:39.855 --> 17:39.995
Mm-hmm.

17:40.015 --> 17:43.941
See, I'm just taking that one.

17:44.782 --> 17:48.046
Oh, what, what they actually need.

17:48.066 --> 17:51.210
Oh, the titles.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.152
I'm just trusting my notes.

17:52.472 --> 17:56.437
All I need is, um, that's Cassini Codex 127.

17:57.459 --> 17:58.320
Mm-hmm.

17:58.340 --> 17:59.281
And the catalog is 127.

18:00.603 --> 18:00.743
Mm-hmm.

18:01.145 --> 18:25.380
This was a very important catalog, Iguanez was a maltese, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it, he described it,

18:25.462 --> 18:29.808
That's gorgeous.

18:30.189 --> 18:32.572
That's number four.

18:33.393 --> 18:39.001
And what's the good thing?

18:39.341 --> 18:49.455
And what is the big century on it?

18:49.676 --> 18:52.219
Eleven.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.621
Eleven century kind.

18:53.941 --> 18:55.063
A thousand years old.

18:57.203 --> 19:02.729
I love this room.

19:02.749 --> 19:09.217
Look at the big farm out here, huh?

19:09.577 --> 19:10.919
This is exquisite.

19:19.308 --> 19:21.591
All done.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.183
All done here.

19:29.340 --> 19:32.931
This, I cannot believe, is a thousand years old.

19:33.232 --> 19:35.057
Look at how brilliant.

19:35.240 --> 19:51.646
They may not come up with a shot.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.128
Thank you.

19:53.909 --> 19:58.176
One, two, three.

19:58.156 --> 20:09.976
This one is unbelievable too.

20:09.996 --> 20:11.220
But he's really...

20:11.960 --> 20:38.942
I'm obsessed with it.

20:38.962 --> 20:39.382
I'm obsessed with it.

20:39.402 --> 20:39.823
I'm obsessed with it.

20:39.803 --> 20:53.280
Oh, the Germans were encamped over there.

20:53.300 --> 20:57.085
That's where the sense of that.

20:57.285 --> 20:58.827
It's pretty close.

21:02.592 --> 21:09.220
Can you have a left hand?

21:11.360 --> 21:32.609
Over there.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.173
Do you think that is Rubble from the bombing over there?

21:36.098 --> 21:37.881
Oh, yes.

21:38.021 --> 21:40.144
Oh, yes.

21:40.224 --> 21:43.549
Oh, yes.

21:43.609 --> 21:53.304
Oh, yes.

21:54.887 --> 21:56.249
Oh, yes.

21:57.551 --> 22:02.899
Oh, yes.

22:03.487 --> 22:05.830
That's definitely a bomb damage.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.674
Look at the little tiny church down there.

22:08.714 --> 22:14.583
You can get a sense of a scale.

22:14.603 --> 22:22.153
You see the little church on the side of the hill?

22:22.474 --> 22:25.838
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

22:25.858 --> 22:26.980
Oh, yes.

22:28.090 --> 22:31.539
Yes, yes, yes.

22:32.160 --> 22:42.707
Yes, yes, yes.

22:42.839 --> 22:45.724
All right.

22:45.744 --> 23:00.527
All right.

23:00.507 --> 23:12.746
Thank you.

23:13.607 --> 23:24.565
Thank you.

23:25.186 --> 23:27.409
Thank you very much.

23:28.233 --> 23:29.215
Ah, the middle one.

23:29.556 --> 23:30.939
Let me just put those tools there.

23:31.079 --> 23:41.922
Oh, yeah.

23:42.307 --> 24:09.462
Thank you.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.935
Your husband's baked, by the way.

24:13.955 --> 24:17.078
A lot of fun.

24:17.098 --> 24:21.682
Yeah, he's gotten a lot more of that.

24:21.702 --> 24:24.465
He didn't have to work for him.

24:24.485 --> 24:31.051
He worked for the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN.

24:34.374 --> 24:36.636
The UN?

24:36.656 --> 24:38.958
Yeah.

24:38.978 --> 24:39.058
Yes.

24:39.078 --> 24:39.178
Okay.

24:40.475 --> 24:48.406
No, no, we met on an airplane.

24:48.647 --> 24:49.408
Oh, you're kidding.

24:49.969 --> 24:51.070
Oh, yeah, we met.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.434
That's rather fun, Helen.

24:54.095 --> 24:59.743
Wouldn't you know that this super map breaks just as where we need to know where to go.

25:00.063 --> 25:02.827
It always happens.

25:02.907 --> 25:04.069
Did you know?

25:04.302 --> 25:04.662
No.

25:05.904 --> 25:09.048
No, we were both engaged to different people.

25:09.069 --> 25:10.350
Oh, you're kidding.

25:10.951 --> 25:12.033
Sort of, yeah, yeah.

25:12.053 --> 25:23.809
I was engaged, sort of engaged to a young man who had just graduated from Princeton, but he was drafted into the Army, and then he became from Florida.

25:23.889 --> 25:28.856
His father lived in New York, and his mother lived in Jacksonville.

25:28.876 --> 25:30.698
His father was horrible in New York.

25:31.471 --> 25:32.552
a horrible New York lawyer.

25:32.753 --> 25:42.345
His mother was a really nice woman who was married to a prosecutor from Florida.

25:42.365 --> 25:43.466
He was a very nice man.

25:44.848 --> 25:55.301
She had two other children by, I think she was only married to Jeffrey's father, about five years old.

25:55.321 --> 25:59.807
This is very annoying, I have to say, and I can't start here for something.

26:02.774 --> 26:08.279
I was going from Torino to where my governess... I had gone to visit my governess.

26:08.960 --> 26:09.300
Did you see her?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.642
Oh yeah, we were devoted to her.

26:10.662 --> 26:16.147
We went... No, she was born in 1892.

26:16.247 --> 26:16.648
Wow.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.613
We were the last family she looked past.

26:22.794 --> 26:31.262
Daddy, I'm afraid to tell you that this map breaks into another map just where we need to know how to get there.

26:32.457 --> 26:40.005
You have to look towards Latina.

26:42.867 --> 26:49.834
What are those little boots?

26:52.757 --> 26:56.701
Are those apricots?

26:56.721 --> 26:58.123
Nick wants to know.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.405
What are they?

27:01.027 --> 27:30.730
Montessant Viaggio, Triverno, Peste.

27:33.562 --> 27:39.169
It's kind of a back road.

27:39.810 --> 27:42.413
Or we could look for Ceremonette.

27:43.093 --> 27:57.471
It will take... No, no, when he gets interested.

27:57.491 --> 28:02.657
He loves to drive, so for him it's no sacrifice to drive.

28:02.941 --> 28:22.682
That's how my mother became very fond of him, because the first time or the second time you met her, we went looking for one of Hajo Gratulini's friends in a church where we finally found the tombstone in the basement of, you know, in some kind of tunnel.

28:23.482 --> 28:25.444
Did you work with your mother?

28:25.464 --> 28:27.306
Yeah, I spent my junior year in Rome.

28:28.247 --> 28:29.128
You were working with your mother?

28:29.589 --> 28:32.712
No, no, my mother came for my spring vacation, and we went.

28:33.653 --> 28:35.977
to Turkey, actually.

28:36.538 --> 28:59.897
That was a really wonderful trip, because we went, my mother had letters to, also there was a professor at Bryn Mawr of Turkish, but she was actually Dutch, but she taught Turkish, and so mommy had letters to,

29:00.383 --> 29:26.205
museum directors, and then, of course, we didn't speak Turkish, so in Ankara, in Ankara, we had a university student who took us to everywhere, very nice young man, and then we, mommy and daddy had gone to graduate school with

29:26.945 --> 29:36.915
the man who was in charge of Sardis, which is very near here, where your grandmother, just that area of Turkey.

29:37.775 --> 29:40.618
And he was a German-Jewish refugee.

29:41.579 --> 29:45.443
And Hattie was a very nice man.

29:46.764 --> 29:50.628
Like, his name was something like Hattie.

29:50.648 --> 29:55.973
And we went to Sardis.

29:56.155 --> 30:03.481
We went to Istanbul and met for four days, five days, and then we flew to Ankara.

30:04.302 --> 30:10.948
And then we went, flew to Izmir, which was Smyrna.

30:10.968 --> 30:14.010
And in Smyrna, we didn't sleep in Smyrna.

30:14.691 --> 30:25.420
But that's very, there are lots of archeological, near, I don't remember where we left, actually, when we went there.

30:26.648 --> 30:33.437
And then we went back to Istanbul and we spent another three days ago.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.419
And we went back to Rome.

30:35.540 --> 30:41.449
It was like a few 12 days to leave somewhere.

30:41.469 --> 30:41.969
It was wonderful.

30:41.989 --> 30:46.596
Except that my mother, I kept teasing my mother who was terrified of flying.

30:47.337 --> 30:51.002
There'd be like a three line, you know how in the New York Times there are these things that they

30:51.370 --> 30:56.438
four Americans found dead in the Costco jungle.

30:57.079 --> 30:59.543
I kept saying they were going to stay.

30:59.643 --> 31:01.166
Three Americans, so we went there.

31:02.508 --> 31:12.063
The year I was in Rome, I had a very good friend whose father was a professor at Harvard of art history and also going to graduate school with my parents.

31:12.744 --> 31:18.694
So, Sarah came with us to a circus.

31:19.197 --> 31:27.126
And so the three of us, my mother finally got really annoyed at us, and said, don't worry about it.

31:27.647 --> 31:35.055
These planes are made in Holland, and they will not crash.

31:35.396 --> 31:47.550
And because she had said, my father was a book about Joseph Conrad.

31:48.205 --> 31:49.206
Just a conrad?

31:49.226 --> 31:49.366
Yes.

31:50.027 --> 31:56.173
Which none of the four of us left.

31:57.214 --> 32:06.323
None of us caught the conrad fever.

32:08.085 --> 32:14.631
My parents didn't go on a honeymoon.

32:14.651 --> 32:16.693
They went to Indonesia to look

32:17.112 --> 32:22.359
for the characters in Elmos Valley, who were real people.

32:22.379 --> 32:33.355
And so they went on a boat, and they flew home.

32:36.079 --> 32:44.311
But the plane was a DC-3, so it didn't fly in bad weather, and it didn't fly at night.

32:44.331 --> 32:46.073
And so they went up at dawn,

32:46.357 --> 32:52.504
came down for 11 minutes and lunch.

32:52.524 --> 33:01.455
And my aunt is still very... His name is Lucy also.

33:02.837 --> 33:05.059
She went with him.

33:05.079 --> 33:12.448
And she was 10 years younger than my father and worshipped him because my grandfather

33:13.272 --> 33:19.303
with a real estate agent in 1979.

33:19.323 --> 33:28.100
Well, he lost everything.

33:28.120 --> 33:32.308
And so my father, they... Well, then don't worry.

33:32.488 --> 33:33.570
That is nice.

33:34.031 --> 33:35.714
Okay, then you want to go?

33:35.734 --> 33:36.175
Then you go.

33:37.184 --> 33:43.650
When we are here, we have to turn up to 80 kilometers.

33:43.670 --> 33:45.192
Here, the Borgo Vodice.

33:48.015 --> 33:54.982
We turn... But it's much too... Why do we have to go all the way there, to the coast?

33:57.204 --> 34:03.310
The only way is Spanish, we go to Vienna.

34:03.813 --> 34:04.674
I love maps.

34:04.974 --> 34:08.258
Oh, I hate maps.

34:08.758 --> 34:09.459
What's Latina?

34:09.519 --> 34:10.240
Is that Rome?

34:10.360 --> 34:13.583
No, it's not Rome.

34:13.624 --> 34:19.129
Latina is a separate city, right?

34:19.310 --> 34:19.650
Oh, yeah.

34:19.670 --> 34:24.175
And you're looking at Fossa Nova.

34:24.215 --> 34:25.837
No, we are looking for Fossa Nova.

34:26.097 --> 34:26.698
Here.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.424
And we are here.

34:32.984 --> 34:33.685
We are here.

34:34.087 --> 34:49.944
So where do we have to go?

34:50.744 --> 35:03.638
Terracina.

35:05.356 --> 35:08.620
I'll go.

35:08.640 --> 35:24.098
I'll go if you do.

35:24.118 --> 35:24.278
I'll go.

35:24.299 --> 35:24.639
Off to Terracina.

35:24.659 --> 35:26.501
We're going left.

35:30.145 --> 35:30.826
So I'm looking for Terracina then?

35:30.846 --> 35:30.966
Right.

35:30.986 --> 35:31.187
All right.

35:31.327 --> 35:32.188
Terracina is quite nice.

35:32.208 --> 35:32.308
Well.

35:33.183 --> 35:54.456
It's pretty far.

35:54.476 --> 35:54.796
What time is it?

35:54.816 --> 35:54.916
3.30.

35:54.936 --> 35:55.938
Well, is it dark by the time we get to this place?

35:55.958 --> 35:56.038
Yes.

35:56.058 --> 35:56.779
Why do we want to go there and park?

35:56.799 --> 35:57.140
It's really good.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.221
We need to go back to Rome, we can go somewhere else.

35:58.241 --> 35:58.542
Somewhere else.

35:58.562 --> 35:59.203
That they haven't seen it going.

35:59.223 --> 35:59.884
It's much more intelligent, yeah.

35:59.904 --> 36:00.625
Rather than looking up an open door.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.278
Okay, Martin.

36:17.480 --> 36:40.856
We're going, and we're going to go... What month?

36:40.876 --> 36:41.637
Can you get back on that house runner?

36:41.657 --> 36:41.877
Everywhere.

36:41.897 --> 36:42.598
So, this is very... Oh, the figure.

36:42.619 --> 36:43.560
I thought, no wonder how we saw all those keys.

36:43.580 --> 36:44.181
Oh, I think it was... Oh, yes.

36:44.201 --> 36:44.922
Everywhere, they go down everywhere.

36:48.142 --> 37:11.702
I've never been to La Scala.

37:11.722 --> 37:13.525
The only time my parents ever flew on a plane together was after we were born in New York.

37:16.019 --> 37:35.545
We were all together, except for my old sister and my parents were both in the most beautiful sight that I ever had before.

37:35.565 --> 37:37.167
And they were both almost worried that they would affect particularly my mother.

37:40.133 --> 38:04.299
So when we left my child, I'll be behind me.

38:04.319 --> 38:06.141
It's really funny because we marked Maya London because there were no questions about life.

38:07.235 --> 38:25.158
And we were so upset that there was a convention of rabbis, of Orthodox rabbis, and they thought somebody had died in the family of the church.

38:25.278 --> 38:29.724
My youngest and I were like weeping all the way from Geneva to London.

38:29.744 --> 38:34.390
They finally asked me if there was some religious counseling that they could give us.

38:34.370 --> 39:00.560
I thought it was so annoying because she didn't get hangover.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.801
Yes, she was certainly able to see me in years, years, years.

39:01.821 --> 39:02.622
Well, there's a bunch of kids, you know.

39:09.166 --> 39:13.118
I'm amazed at all of them today.

40:37.709 --> 40:57.048
If you have a contractual deadline, you'll see.

40:57.068 --> 40:57.869
If the editor is happy, it doesn't work.

40:57.889 --> 40:58.350
Yeah, I hope to get it.

40:58.370 --> 40:58.671
I'm so worried.

41:03.713 --> 41:30.463
The last book I tried to chronologically do, but I get it all over the place.

41:31.591 --> 41:57.504
It's almost like a 6-4-8-9-10, and I can tell you, 5-4-3-2-1, which is the way I saw it, but I didn't get the first shot in the lab.

41:57.524 --> 41:58.686
It's getting a very different direction, but I can see it.

41:58.706 --> 41:59.947
It's not that I wanted to use, but it's going to be different.

41:59.967 --> 42:00.568
It's not going to be episodic.

42:04.210 --> 42:24.575
I really feel ready to start writing now.

42:24.595 --> 42:25.076
I feel like I've got it.

42:25.096 --> 42:25.737
I have a lot of work to do that.

42:25.757 --> 42:26.758
We will be working together at least weekly stuff.

42:38.078 --> 42:54.337
I think that we can explain children's books at once in one story.

42:54.357 --> 42:55.358
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

42:55.379 --> 42:56.380
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.401
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

42:57.421 --> 42:58.422
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

42:58.442 --> 42:59.443
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

42:59.463 --> 43:00.465
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:00.485 --> 43:01.486
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:01.506 --> 43:02.507
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:02.527 --> 43:03.528
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:03.548 --> 43:04.549
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:04.569 --> 43:05.571
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:05.591 --> 43:06.592
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:06.612 --> 43:07.613
And we keep children's books at once in one story.

43:07.913 --> 43:24.779
And it's hard.

43:24.799 --> 43:25.720
It's a situation that comes to the same thing.

43:29.058 --> 43:55.358
We have two newspapers that only take a full.

43:55.378 --> 43:56.359
We have Orlando, Florida, and San Antonio, Texas.

43:56.379 --> 43:57.020
And we have a great circulation.

43:57.040 --> 43:57.601
We have a great market here.

43:57.621 --> 43:58.322
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:17.320 --> 44:47.209
I don't know.

45:05.600 --> 45:25.806
So we can do it very systematically.

45:25.826 --> 45:26.446
I have to say very effectively.

45:26.466 --> 45:27.007
We don't want to get a lot.

45:27.027 --> 45:27.568
We don't want to get a lot.

45:27.588 --> 45:28.128
We don't want to get a lot.

45:28.149 --> 45:28.689
We don't want to get a lot.

45:28.709 --> 45:29.250
We don't want to get a lot.

45:29.270 --> 45:29.811
We don't want to get a lot.

45:29.831 --> 45:30.371
We don't want to get a lot.

45:30.391 --> 45:30.932
We don't want to get a lot.

45:35.705 --> 46:01.274
Very hard.

46:01.294 --> 46:01.734
I grew up my computer.

46:01.754 --> 46:03.096
I get a book called The Editor of Public Affairs, so I have a film.

46:03.116 --> 46:04.918
So what I did is I formulated a strategy book that focuses on the city that I do currently

46:08.392 --> 46:33.710
I think it is .

46:33.730 --> 46:34.231
And then I also got the .

46:34.251 --> 46:34.752
And this is the highest .

46:34.772 --> 46:35.233
Well, and I don't know.

46:35.253 --> 46:35.493
There isn't.

46:35.513 --> 46:35.854
Eugene, Oregon, .

46:35.874 --> 46:36.154
And we're in .

46:40.538 --> 47:05.382
I've been on this last three years.

47:11.285 --> 47:34.932
And I was writing the column because I always had the newspaper to open it.

47:34.952 --> 47:35.833
So when I left the paper, I kept the column.

47:35.853 --> 47:36.434
It made me write the article.

47:36.454 --> 47:37.094
So it was so good I didn't know.

47:37.115 --> 47:37.515
I was a book editor.

47:37.535 --> 47:37.935
I was a book editor.

47:37.955 --> 47:38.356
I was a book editor.

47:38.376 --> 47:38.836
So I had a book editor.

47:38.856 --> 47:39.317
So I had a book editor.

47:56.965 --> 48:22.688
So my job is my job, and, um, and, uh, .

48:22.708 --> 48:22.728
.

48:22.748 --> 48:22.768
.

48:22.788 --> 48:22.808
.

48:22.828 --> 48:22.848
.

48:22.868 --> 48:22.888
.

48:22.909 --> 48:22.929
.

48:22.949 --> 48:22.969
.

48:22.989 --> 48:23.009
.

48:23.029 --> 48:23.049
.

48:23.069 --> 48:23.089
.

48:23.109 --> 48:23.129
.

48:23.149 --> 48:23.169
.

48:23.189 --> 48:23.209
.

48:45.059 --> 48:48.184
Oh, well, I think we don't mind the action.

50:16.066 --> 50:34.227
Thank you.

50:51.217 --> 50:52.502
Thank you.

51:24.292 --> 51:27.417
Thank you.

52:09.533 --> 52:22.030
I don't know.

52:22.050 --> 52:22.311
I don't know.

52:53.881 --> 53:14.978
Outside this time, there were a lot of people who were kind of afraid about these tropes, but outside this time, and now about this time, and now about this time, and now about this time, and I think it's a great thing about this, about this time,

53:24.728 --> 53:42.051
I always think that about, you know, we're always here at the start of the night.

53:42.071 --> 53:43.433
So we're going to have to go back to the start of the business plan.

53:43.453 --> 53:44.815
So we're going to have to go back to the start of the business plan.

53:44.835 --> 53:46.197
So we're going to have to go back to the start of the business plan.

54:17.463 --> 54:41.704
It's something like this.

54:41.724 --> 54:43.325
And it's a thing that kind of looks at me, being troubled by exactly what it is.

54:43.345 --> 54:45.728
Because, I won't tell you the story, but it's also by the contamination of, by the kind of law that has happened to me.

54:45.748 --> 54:46.288
And I think it's important.

54:48.479 --> 54:59.434
And so she turned out

55:20.103 --> 55:26.226
So there's a lot.

55:26.246 --> 55:27.109
There's a perfect look for a lot of people.

56:18.693 --> 56:30.276
About that, it was a very good time.

56:30.296 --> 56:31.077
I think we're just ahead of you for us.

56:31.097 --> 56:31.538
So that's a good time.

56:45.068 --> 57:12.468
And I don't remember if she was the father of the daughter.

57:12.488 --> 57:13.590
But anyway, it was still a sort of thing where she was.
