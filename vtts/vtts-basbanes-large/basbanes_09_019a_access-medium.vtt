00:03.187 --> 00:06.051
Welcome to John Byer.

00:06.091 --> 00:14.362
We had an interview, you and I, once before, in Cambridge over at the Charles Hotel, I believe, on the occasion of the previous novel.

00:14.903 --> 00:16.365
Of the Last Voyager Cinema.

00:16.385 --> 00:16.866
Right, right.

00:16.886 --> 00:17.387
Exactly.

00:17.427 --> 00:19.910
And there are... I remember the face.

00:20.611 --> 00:27.921
It seems that there are... I mean, the medical workers are certainly resident out there.

00:27.941 --> 00:29.263
Life remains a voyage.

00:29.283 --> 00:33.008
1390.

00:33.764 --> 00:37.229
My last, my first book tour, that was.

00:37.249 --> 00:37.850
Is that right?

00:37.870 --> 00:38.210
Yeah.

00:39.171 --> 00:40.934
Did you have to be persuaded to do that?

00:41.214 --> 00:42.556
A little bit, and I did it.

00:42.576 --> 00:49.886
I am a long-time coach of other writers, and among the reasons why I did it was that the publisher never asked me before.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.530
I had the new publisher, Little Brown, for the last board.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.793
They'd give me, by my standards, an okay advance.

00:55.651 --> 00:56.392
Why not?

00:56.412 --> 00:58.836
I'll tell my student what it's like.

00:58.876 --> 01:01.861
You don't mind us going off on a couple of tangents?

01:01.921 --> 01:02.682
No, not at all.

01:02.702 --> 01:05.406
I mean, the novel for itself, certainly.

01:07.931 --> 01:08.832
How did you respond?

01:08.912 --> 01:11.456
I'm curious, because it is a wrangling question.

01:11.596 --> 01:13.079
Well, my hesitation has to do.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.444
I cut my teeth on the big modern.

01:16.930 --> 01:20.054
Joyce and Kafka and Proust, and that was another world.

01:20.074 --> 01:21.195
They didn't do things like that.

01:21.356 --> 01:24.500
Though I kept telling myself I bet Dickens and Twain did.

01:24.540 --> 01:25.821
I bet they did.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.784
Anyhow, I wanted to try.

01:27.824 --> 01:33.872
My apprehensions were they were a little bit in for a ding, but it turned out not to be at all.

01:33.912 --> 01:35.614
It was a reading tour, mainly.

01:35.674 --> 01:41.301
My readings, which I do with some regular anyhow, are usually to university audiences, so it was interesting for me.

01:41.973 --> 01:45.477
to tour, especially those big Midwestern and West Coast bookstores.

01:45.497 --> 01:49.302
Those great big bookstores that are really oases of literary culture.

01:49.382 --> 01:52.486
We have a couple here in Boston now that are Waterstones.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.788
That's where I'm reading tonight.

01:54.228 --> 01:56.992
That's a new one today.

01:57.072 --> 02:02.979
Last time I was here, it was the Cambridge Bookshop does its readings in the Cambridge Library.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.023
That's what I was living back in university.

02:06.526 --> 02:16.360
There's really quite a competitive situation now, I mean, where all these bookstores are bringing in authors, and if you're talking about Waterstones, then you can't go to Wordsworth.

02:16.901 --> 02:20.165
I'm not convinced by the way that it makes any economic sense whatsoever.

02:20.205 --> 02:28.977
It may in some cases, but what it costs them, I mean, look, we're here in the street, and they've got the airfare, they've got the restaurant charges.

02:28.997 --> 02:31.281
They're not going to sell those books.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.723
That's not the way the bookkeeping works.

02:32.883 --> 02:35.567
Except that it's good to get them the name.

02:35.587 --> 02:35.807
I mean,

02:36.327 --> 02:40.372
It's good to get the book and the author, I think, visible.

02:40.832 --> 02:41.413
What do I know?

02:42.014 --> 02:44.476
It's their economics for them to figure out.

02:44.897 --> 02:49.963
So, I guess the burning question is biography and fiction here together.

02:51.104 --> 02:55.149
Yes, and your interview is the first of this little mini-tour.

02:55.850 --> 03:00.175
I'm just doing a few East Coast citizens trying to get back home, because my wife can't travel with me.

03:00.195 --> 03:02.217
She's still teaching.

03:03.209 --> 03:05.672
It'll give you a chance to warm up on some of those questions.

03:05.993 --> 03:08.216
You will be the first to... I'll softball.

03:10.679 --> 03:14.905
Well, I found myself... I don't much like autobiographical fiction.

03:16.147 --> 03:17.949
I know some writers who do it well.

03:18.029 --> 03:22.936
We know that writers like John Updike, for example, often work very close to the bone, although not always.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.960
So I've tended to steer away from it.

03:26.020 --> 03:29.385
I noticed in The Last Voyage, my previous novel,

03:29.973 --> 03:47.953
that the here-and-now sections of that novel, contrasted with the long-ago and far-away Scheherazade sections, were, while not autobiographical, much closer to various data of my actual experience than had been the case in previous novels.

03:47.973 --> 03:57.263
The most autobiographical things I had written before, the Greek mythological novella back in the old days, there was enough distance there in the situation to let me be a little person.

03:58.188 --> 04:15.526
But I found myself, when the last order was done, and I was making notes toward what to do for an encore, interested in examining—I guess I had reached the sort of junior, senior citizen age, where one becomes interested in reviewing the waypoints that got you where you are, for better or worse, reimagining those waypoints.

04:16.106 --> 04:27.418
And I ended up, for better or worse, as the program note to this floating opera says, bottling a kind of memoir in a kind of novel.

04:28.006 --> 04:46.828
it must be obvious to anybody who reads whether they know anything about my brother or humdrum life or not, that the framing story, which is the novel that encases the memoir, a story of the voyage of the narrator and his wife, which is the humongous storm, and he gets lost in life.

04:46.868 --> 04:47.749
That's all fiction.

04:47.929 --> 04:52.615
My wife and I are sailors, but we don't get caught out in storms or nothing like that.

04:52.855 --> 04:57.000
But I thought to myself, this addresses the two great what-ifs

04:57.368 --> 04:58.730
of my personal life.

04:58.850 --> 05:13.487
What if, tongue and key, what if I were ever to lose this pen, which they replicated perfectly on the cover here, my immortal British maid, Parker 51, which I regard as the totem and instrument of my authority.

05:14.929 --> 05:26.683
And what if, God forbid, anything should ever happen to my connection with this book's dedicated to, my wife, who might have been happily married for 20 to 23 years now.

05:27.271 --> 05:35.161
Well, the scenario, the overture of the opera quickly sees to it that both of these things come to pass, otherwise there'd be no story, of course.

05:35.181 --> 05:55.287
The guy gets lost in the marshes, loses his pen overboard, gets separated in the labyrinthine marshes of a place very like near where I grew up on the lower eastern shore of Maryland, gets separated from his wife, that he's enough to do in those labyrinthine marshes, and finds, you know, by this time we're out of it here and now and into the realm of

05:55.807 --> 05:58.530
the mythical labyrinth and the mythical quest.

05:59.011 --> 06:04.918
He finds it in order to get back to where he wants to go, back to where he started, like Dante in the Dark Wood.

06:05.378 --> 06:15.670
He's got to go not through hell, the purgatory and paradiso, but back to square one, which, a prospect that he greets with a groan and a roll of the eyes.

06:16.191 --> 06:20.716
And then he gets involved in a kind of laser holograph version of This Is Your Life.

06:21.998 --> 06:24.801
Now, in the memoir part,

06:25.118 --> 06:51.013
The chief element of fiction, of course, other than the mechanics of the thing, this hyperspace in which all that takes place, the chief element of fiction is that my novelist intuitions told me early on, there needs to be a foil, there needs to be an opposite number, a kind of combination, best friend, confidant, bête noire, artistic conscience, and Marley's ghost.

06:53.276 --> 06:54.197
That one.

06:54.869 --> 07:05.441
who might give the ponderous name, the humorous name of J. Wordsworth Scribner, that's a name that he himself, an invented character, has assumed tongue half in cheek.

07:05.461 --> 07:07.242
And he turns, he plays the role.

07:08.284 --> 07:16.913
The book is about vocation, the calling, and this guy plays the role of the gooser, you know, the catalyst, the one who prods the action along.

07:17.353 --> 07:22.259
No such person as I need as to say existed in my own history would that there had been one.

07:22.379 --> 07:23.340
I would have gotten through things

07:23.658 --> 07:25.000
probably with a little less sweat.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.945
But he is Jay Scribner.

07:28.466 --> 07:39.804
He's an affectionate amalgam of a number of friends I've had, both as a child and as a student and so forth, and as an adult, plus some I never had and should have had.

07:40.264 --> 07:43.209
Plus an alter ego.

07:43.509 --> 07:49.178
He is a kind of counter-self in that respect.

07:49.198 --> 07:51.522
How about the conception of the story?

07:51.957 --> 08:00.069
Did it start as this exercise for you, or did the story, in terms of creating a narrative here?

08:00.530 --> 08:07.260
The story started when I had finished The Last Voyage and was making notes toward whatever next thing, trying to figure out.

08:07.320 --> 08:14.711
My muse is a little bit like those Hollywood monsters that mumble things, and the heroine says, I think it's trying to tell us something.

08:14.792 --> 08:19.078
And I listened to these mumblings and found out what it's trying to say.

08:20.138 --> 08:28.007
I wrote a little short piece that ended up in the Paris Review, and it ends up in here, called Jack and Jill.

08:28.027 --> 08:35.635
Those were the nicknames of my opposite twin sister and myself, Lamonis Meyer, a slightly older brother.

08:36.316 --> 08:49.690
And that exegetical area, as I called it, Jack and Jill, became the germ of the notion of taking this guided tour through my rather unexciting history.

08:49.973 --> 09:03.332
to look for the waypoints that seemed to me turned this particular semi-rural, semi-redneck, lower middle class kid into a novelist.

09:03.372 --> 09:19.795
I'm interested in that in part because we're interested in ones on track, in part because I've watched so many other novelists, young novelists come to fruition or not come to fruition under my own coaching over the decades.

09:20.247 --> 09:21.489
No autobiography.

09:22.430 --> 09:34.286
I'm a fiction writer, and I could not write one chapter without immediately making up things that would make, not my life more interesting, but would make the narrative, otherwise it would be a tedious story.

09:34.627 --> 09:39.734
Do you basically suggest that your life is boring if told in a straight memoir?

09:39.994 --> 09:44.280
There is no complete telling thing straight, but I did come to appreciate

09:45.222 --> 09:48.407
Nick, as I think anyone can... Happy to be cute with the question.

09:48.427 --> 10:14.605
No, no, no, not at all, but I did come to appreciate very rapidly that, as the program says, every life does have a Scheherazade's worth of stories, and a person could tell any story of one's life as a series of sexual liaisons, as a series of job-career moves, as a series of ideologies subscribed to, as a series of magazines subscribed to, I think, any series of things.

10:14.855 --> 10:21.822
can hang together a story of your life, and you get a somewhat different story depending on what waypoints you choose to organize the trip by.

10:22.503 --> 10:36.438
I chose a vocation simply not to let the thing sprawl or deliquest into a random connection, a random string of anecdotes about a life which, objectively speaking, has not been a broad viewer of life.

10:36.478 --> 10:42.364
For example, last week, I think it was, Mario Vargas Llosa published his memoirs.

10:42.614 --> 10:51.987
Now, here's a guy who's lived an extremely colorful life, you know, including running for president of Peru and doing all sorts of dangerous and bravura things.

10:52.769 --> 10:59.518
My life, fortunately, because I don't envy that sort of thing, my life has been, by and large, a fairly tranquil one.

10:59.538 --> 11:03.424
I've been a teacher all my adult life and a novelist.

11:03.564 --> 11:12.537
The most exciting things that have happened to me have happened in the head, in the imagination, at the desk, under the quiet circumstances, and it doesn't make very exciting readings.

11:12.871 --> 11:35.133
How to tell it, then, well, the voyage, the disorientation, or potential loss of self and other, on which you have to get a new handle in order to proceed, in order to recover, partner with, and what they have come to stand for.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.416
It's much more pleasant telling stories, making up stories, than the universe.

11:38.556 --> 11:40.718
Well, would you say the most exciting parts are invented?

11:42.470 --> 11:48.557
People find different things exciting.

11:48.617 --> 11:57.368
In the objective way, the most durer part of the thing is the big storm, the loss of way that drives them into marginal, and that's purely invented.

11:57.988 --> 12:02.934
It's an extrapolation, as many things in fiction are, from things that I've experienced, but thank God never that.

12:03.155 --> 12:10.283
This is fiction as exorcism or preventive medicine, imagining the worst that will happen.

12:11.174 --> 12:35.663
within the novel itself, within the memoir part of the novel, it does deal, in what I hope, in the most discreet way, with the single most harrowing experience of my 60 now, four years, the end of my 20-year first marriage, and we've ended up in my divorce, and so far a very successful and happy 20-something year now.

12:36.200 --> 12:41.787
remarriage, but that's a story, as the chapter head says, that's a story too banal to tell.

12:42.007 --> 12:49.776
It happens nowadays in America to what is 50% of all American marriages in the separation report.

12:49.796 --> 12:54.642
Nevertheless, there were children involved who then, thank God, were on their way off to college.

12:54.762 --> 12:57.946
They were almost out of the nest, but not quite.

12:58.487 --> 13:06.156
And that made things somewhat less terrifying, perhaps, for innocent bystanders than it might have been in 18,

13:06.659 --> 13:13.947
and there's going to be a whole lot of parenting.

13:14.007 --> 13:22.196
Nevertheless, I think it's a rather happy life that has had in it so far.

13:22.216 --> 13:30.085
Nothing more terrifying than that, a divorce which I'll ask for both parties, and now it turns somewhat acrimonious, despite the parties resolved and it moved on.

13:31.398 --> 13:36.545
At what point did this structure of the opera come into play?

13:36.965 --> 13:59.093
Well, when it occurred, you know, you do listen to what your muse is trying to mumble, and when I saw that my notes were saying, narrator, like Dante in dark wood gets lost, must retrace steps or go to the bottom of things or back to square one in order to get where he's going to go, the few things that were prominent in my mind at the time, this was 1990 when I began to write it, two years before Columbus Day.

13:59.326 --> 14:04.772
I, in fact, began to write in just about the budget and dates a little bit, just about Columbus Day, 1990.

14:04.832 --> 14:28.236
I began to draft sentences, and it occurred to me, what about if I suppose I had a friend who did things more boldly than myself, who instead of taking a little end-of-the-season sale right about Columbus Day, really decided to do Columbus's voyage in reverse, the return, and then right on, you know, back up the Mediterranean, up a mile, over to the Rift Valley, back to mankind's square ones.

14:28.537 --> 14:35.687
With that as a kind of guide or parameter, it didn't take too long for the framework of the book to fall together.

14:37.309 --> 14:41.175
Though this one was not meant to be a sailing novel, I just finished the sailing novel.

14:41.195 --> 14:45.521
So I tried to keep the actual navigation passages to a minimum.

14:45.541 --> 14:48.125
You mentioned that this is your pen here on the jacket.

14:48.205 --> 14:52.911
So did you basically sketch out your idea for the jacket art?

14:53.933 --> 14:56.136
No, they said, do you have any ideas?

14:56.176 --> 14:58.459
And at this time, I'd finished the book

14:58.642 --> 15:18.692
By the time Columbus Day 92 came around, I'd just finished the first draft, and my wife and I had the loan of an apartment in the Bahamas for that winter, and I took the book down there, and the Bahamian currency that year was a commemorative currency for Columbus's first landing.

15:19.094 --> 15:22.098
And when the people at Little Brown Graphics said, you have any idea this book?

15:22.118 --> 15:24.301
I said, well, look, you've got a lot of stuff on it.

15:24.321 --> 15:27.124
You brought that with you, I should point out, for my tape here.

15:27.785 --> 15:29.748
Are you going to use this in your reading?

15:29.768 --> 15:30.929
This is my bookmark.

15:30.949 --> 15:34.514
Well, that's your bookmark.

15:35.395 --> 15:39.179
They then, and I said, you know, there is that pen, and there's sailing.

15:39.199 --> 15:48.291
So they somehow found an exact replica of this Parker 51, which dates from 1963, 62, excuse me,

15:48.473 --> 15:50.235
In fact, that's the perfect color.

15:50.315 --> 15:51.236
That's the absolute shape.

15:51.256 --> 15:53.999
Then they chopped up the currency.

15:54.139 --> 16:01.067
In its first version, it looked to my wife to be a bit like a book about drug money laundering in the Bahamas.

16:01.747 --> 16:05.291
So they softened down that a little bit, put a floating opera in it.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.013
We've got the floating opera in here.

16:07.153 --> 16:09.936
And they put a Chesapeake Bay blue crab on there.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.139
And they had it one sale.

16:12.179 --> 16:16.303
The graphics, like Edgar Poe, didn't know the difference between a cutter and a sloop.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.159
It's very nice, though.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.462
Yeah, I like that.

16:20.502 --> 16:40.686
The floating opera idea, to circle back to your question, when I realized that it was going to be a kind of back-to-square-one thing, and since it's seen as vocation, not those other possible series of waypoints I mentioned, it occurred to me, one, and it is another sea yarn, for better or worse, in its frame.

16:40.706 --> 16:46.273
Anyhow, I thought, why not go back, as it were, to the first book I ever published?

16:46.608 --> 16:51.033
the floating opera, and use an operatic format.

16:51.553 --> 16:56.838
This one, as I didn't in the original one, but the other one had a showboat in it, which took the place in the opera.

16:57.960 --> 17:06.288
Here I decided, since I am an opera fan, why not have a narrative in the form of recidivism with arias and interleaves?

17:06.308 --> 17:11.974
It clearly seems that all of these books are part of a...

17:12.190 --> 17:13.512
much broader canvas.

17:13.532 --> 17:20.243
Is that a fair... Yeah, though I think the differences between them are at least as large as any similarities.

17:20.263 --> 17:31.320
They do all proceed out of the same imagination and there is that kind of maybe arbitrary organicity about them.

17:31.741 --> 17:39.193
It makes me uncomfortable when over sophisticated critics will say it's actually the whole thing will add up to a mega novel.

17:39.764 --> 17:50.039
I guess there's a loose sense in which you could say that about all of Faulkner, or all of Thomas Mann, all of any of them, because it does proceed out of the same imagination.

17:50.059 --> 17:51.060
Well, I think certainly in Faulkner.

17:51.120 --> 18:01.295
In Faulkner, where the characters occur and the situation is the same, there's a little bit of that in my work, but it seems to me, God, that whatever general... Well, I don't think there's a little bit of a cow here, so to speak, over there.

18:01.715 --> 18:08.725
Yeah, it is a kind of a tidewater yacht to which I leave and to which I return.

18:09.312 --> 18:26.857
The Giles Goatboy novel, the novellas and short stories, which are reorchestrations of dream classical myths, can't even know anything to do with the solemn immersion and so forth, though there isn't as much me in them, it seems to me, and some preoccupation with the same kind of things.

18:26.877 --> 18:36.130
A little reading I'll get tonight at Waterstones, for example, is an idea from here about messages in bottles, something that's fascinating since I've been a kid.

18:36.464 --> 18:41.029
It certainly runs through some of the Greek novellas, the Greek mythical novellas that I wrote as well.

18:42.771 --> 18:52.122
You do have... Italo Calvino used to say that every writer has a hand of cards, and then he recombines them and reshuffles them, you know, but essentially it's leaving.

18:52.162 --> 18:57.087
You can discard a few, maybe pick up a few, but essentially you're playing the same hand of cards.

18:57.107 --> 19:00.211
Didn't Walker pursue anything message in the bottle, I think.

19:00.231 --> 19:01.613
He has got a thing left in the bottle.

19:01.633 --> 19:02.894
He actually used that title.

19:03.174 --> 19:03.635
That's right.

19:03.655 --> 19:05.577
The title.

19:07.835 --> 19:14.383
Do you have a reader in mind when you're drafting these little works?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.485
Do you have somebody?

19:16.505 --> 19:17.006
This reader.

19:17.646 --> 19:26.737
And increasingly, over the decades of the books that I've dedicated to my wife since 1970 when we married, she has been conscious.

19:26.757 --> 19:34.686
She happens to have an astonishing eye for sentences and an astonishing memory for what cards have been played.

19:35.324 --> 19:46.680
She's my editor of First Resort, and she'll be the one who can say, you can't say this here, because over here you said this other thing, you know.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.524
And I'll say, by God, they don't quite jump in this particular world.

19:49.544 --> 19:50.145
In all books.

19:50.365 --> 19:51.767
Oh, really?

19:52.428 --> 19:55.252
There's that kind of consistency.

19:55.272 --> 20:00.960
And the reader, and that's the reader I have in mind frequently, I like these things, is Shelley.

20:01.143 --> 20:02.405
in that sense.

20:02.445 --> 20:03.807
What would Shelley think about this?

20:04.128 --> 20:12.721
Is this going to strike her as a dopey reaction, or is this the way this person would really respond in this context?

20:13.762 --> 20:15.164
I've learned to trust her on that.

20:15.185 --> 20:17.789
I don't always take her advice on what we think anything.

20:17.929 --> 20:21.033
I was about to say, where Shelley says, oh, this doesn't work.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.337
Well, then it's either one that I decide to

20:23.688 --> 20:27.191
Nevertheless, I want it there for a reason I can't always explain.

20:27.311 --> 20:27.811
To get angry?

20:27.831 --> 20:28.272
No, no, we don't.

20:28.292 --> 20:32.816
These conversations are on the level of two in our teacher's focus.

20:32.836 --> 20:34.857
I know my wife will read.

20:35.198 --> 20:36.118
She's my first.

20:36.218 --> 20:37.760
I just finished my own book, by the way.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.161
No compliment.

20:39.201 --> 20:39.681
Thank you.

20:39.701 --> 20:41.823
It's published by Henry Holtz early next year.

20:42.524 --> 20:43.064
Non-fiction.

20:43.084 --> 20:44.465
What sort of book?

20:44.485 --> 20:46.447
It's on Bibliomania.

20:46.467 --> 20:47.428
Book Madness.

20:48.929 --> 20:53.593
But in any case, my wife will read and challenge me on something.

20:54.029 --> 20:59.237
And when I know she's right, I get angry, you know.

20:59.257 --> 21:08.972
But, you know, I spent my life, you do, and your way too, but I spend my life fixing other people's metaphors, and, you know, these are excellent apprentices, the graduate students, and some are publishing already.

21:09.412 --> 21:14.400
And I'm always telling me, you know, I need to take this character out, he's not earning his pay on the payroll, you know, combine these two.

21:14.549 --> 21:16.272
Have something more interesting happen here.

21:16.292 --> 21:17.093
This is terrific.

21:17.113 --> 21:18.014
This sucks.

21:18.175 --> 21:20.879
You get a little used to doing it.

21:20.919 --> 21:23.263
So you've certainly got to get used to taking them with somebody.

21:23.303 --> 21:32.297
And you know, of course, everybody knows what advice immediately makes good sense, what advice, well, I'll pretend I don't think it ever, and what just won't do.

21:33.018 --> 21:36.604
I know that as one who writes... My real editors, by the way, are good at that, too.

21:36.644 --> 21:39.949
I've had a whole series of editors at different publishers over my life.

21:40.368 --> 21:45.233
except for one who was a good editor in the sense of fighting your battles with the hierarchy.

21:45.253 --> 21:45.914
That's an important editor.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.556
It is, but who didn't edit.

21:48.016 --> 22:04.193
All the other ones I've had, I'm speaking of three or four or five, not eight or nine or ten, have been sharp editors whose advice, again, I don't always follow, but whose advice I've been able to take seriously, and more often than not, will at least attempt to follow.

22:04.914 --> 22:06.055
I have my respect for those.

22:06.693 --> 22:15.645
I hope you luck out with your editor as well.

22:15.866 --> 22:17.508
I've got Alan Peacock.

22:17.688 --> 22:18.890
Oh, yeah, I know that.

22:18.910 --> 22:19.431
A young guy.

22:19.511 --> 22:20.252
For sure, yeah.

22:20.292 --> 22:25.339
He's Bob from Robert Owen Butler, and I'm thrilled to have him.

22:25.359 --> 22:27.622
I'm sure I'm having him number one because he loves my book.

22:27.742 --> 22:28.463
Good, yeah.

22:28.483 --> 22:29.084
That's a start.

22:31.728 --> 22:33.510
For sure.

22:33.878 --> 22:36.281
Is that a lot of success when will we be published?

22:36.301 --> 22:37.062
Early next year.

22:37.403 --> 22:38.164
We just sold it.

22:38.644 --> 22:40.567
Does that start again, one of the things?

22:41.087 --> 22:41.328
Sure.

22:41.348 --> 23:00.713
One of the things I learned on my last and major tour from Little Brown for the last toy and so by the sailor was to be a little more careful about my, what had become a reflexive opinion on my part, that the reading public is withering away and everybody's attention spans are shorter and the books are going away and the rhinoceroses and the whales are...

23:01.047 --> 23:16.673
And in those, particularly in those Midwestern and West Coast places like Hungry Mind and the Tattered Cover and Powell's and so forth, they are not only busy LACs of a literary culture, they have like one reading a night in many of those places.

23:17.634 --> 23:25.828
But they told me, a couple of them told me, that the volume of their business had been increasing in some cases at 15, 20% a year, you know, which is extraordinary.

23:25.848 --> 23:27.190
Want to have another story?

23:27.541 --> 23:30.384
We've learned that one crop agriculture is a bad thing.

23:30.484 --> 23:34.288
You know, Americans have learned they better exercise more, smoke less, drink less.

23:34.308 --> 23:40.895
Well, they may be learning that a one media economy is not a good idea either, you know.

23:41.776 --> 23:49.184
Well, let me ask, for me now, I'm in seven newspapers and growing every week, I should be pleased to say.

23:50.866 --> 23:53.809
I have vital signs that I can check.

23:53.869 --> 23:55.050
I write something.

23:55.402 --> 24:00.066
this morning, and it'll start being published tomorrow and through Sunday, and I'll hear from people.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.730
For you, what are the vital signs for you?

24:03.750 --> 24:05.631
I mean, I'm not writing out into any vacuum.

24:05.651 --> 24:13.859
I mean, I noticed, you know, in your beginning, October 90 to 12 October 92, and there's this period, this creative void.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.482
I mean, that's not too long, almost, but far from a void.

24:17.522 --> 24:23.147
It's not a void, but I mean, it's just like you're in this place where you're not

24:24.022 --> 24:25.844
What, for you, are the vital scientists?

24:25.864 --> 24:26.365
When do you feel it?

24:26.405 --> 24:27.486
I think I know what you mean.

24:27.626 --> 24:33.012
Unlike such a writer as my friend John Updike, for example, who, even when he's working on a novel, is publishing other things.

24:33.032 --> 24:36.495
So there is a dialogue going on between him and his readers, him and his editors.

24:36.576 --> 24:41.060
For me, this was fast for many, two years, two and a half years.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.244
For me, typically, it's 41 American presidential administration.

24:44.324 --> 24:49.890
It takes me one American presidential term, rather, or the time it takes to matriculate and get a bachelor's degree.

24:49.930 --> 24:51.912
That's usually how long it takes me to write a novel.

24:51.952 --> 24:53.674
And in that period,

24:53.873 --> 24:59.639
I have, by and large, no contact or virtually no contact with my editor, with my agent.

24:59.659 --> 25:02.402
I like to present them, for example, with faits accompli.

25:02.422 --> 25:03.503
I'm not one of those writers.

25:03.584 --> 25:06.427
I know some who send up each chapter because they won't respond.

25:06.447 --> 25:08.769
I've got my wife for that, you know, my muse for that.

25:10.091 --> 25:21.963
That doesn't mean, though, Nicholas, particularly as you go along in your career, that doesn't mean that the dialogue in slow time between oneself and one's readers stops, you know.

25:22.024 --> 25:23.425
You get mail.

25:24.063 --> 25:32.395
It may be that somebody's just picked up Giles' Goat Boy, which for me, that was me back in the mid-1960s, but it's new to them.

25:33.317 --> 25:36.121
Or even the Floating Opera, the first one.

25:36.622 --> 25:44.333
Thank God I've been fortunate enough so that most of the books, not all of them, most of the books are still around in print.

25:44.554 --> 25:50.863
And so it delights me when, even at a reading like tonight, there will always be somebody who's got

25:51.113 --> 25:54.758
three kilograms of your old stuff, you know.

25:54.778 --> 26:14.843
Well, that's touching, and it means that even though your audience may not be the mass audience, not to mention the large audience of more commercially successful literary novelists like Bill Styron or John Updike or who have you, still, the books don't

26:15.194 --> 26:15.795
disappear.

26:15.815 --> 26:16.916
They haven't disappeared.

26:16.936 --> 26:17.617
They're out there.

26:17.657 --> 26:23.563
Some people, including another generation of students, let's say, is picking up on them one way or another.

26:24.123 --> 26:28.067
And that kind of mail, although it doesn't swamp me, is gratifying.

26:28.087 --> 26:43.203
It's not as if the mail may bring some bags of this stuff, but letters come in from time to time, which do encourage one to believe that reading it, if it's an art that's under attrition, it's not one that's kaput already.

26:43.443 --> 26:44.965
It encourages me to hope that

26:45.552 --> 26:56.484
that the preserves in which readers and novels and novelists continue to persist into the 21st century, while they're going to be small, maybe they won't be extinct.

26:56.504 --> 27:05.514
It may be that the rainforests and the whales and the rhinoceros and the tigers will survive in a slightly larger number than the worst scenarios.

27:07.116 --> 27:08.978
But God, there is no question about that.

27:09.768 --> 27:13.873
but the other media, and now CD-ROMs and Hypertech and things like that.

27:13.993 --> 27:20.841
Every one of those things, like having a new restaurant in town where there's a limited number of customers, and we can still only eat three meals.

27:20.921 --> 27:24.645
There's going to be some shading off.

27:24.725 --> 27:26.567
Well, it doesn't go back to what you said earlier.

27:26.588 --> 27:29.951
You really aren't writing for any particular reader.

27:31.593 --> 27:32.514
I really am not.

27:32.715 --> 27:34.797
The need for this kind of...

27:37.004 --> 27:42.070
I hate that computer word, input, you know, but responds, I guess.

27:44.152 --> 27:44.272
Right.

27:44.332 --> 27:50.940
Not only that, you know, I'm old enough and I've done enough now so that I am less concerned.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.082
You know, I always hope the books will do all right.

27:53.203 --> 27:58.609
After all, I'm practicing the medium of the novel, which begins as a genre of popular entertainment.

27:59.310 --> 28:04.075
And it still delights me, as I've said somewhere here, it still delights me when a really good novelist

28:04.561 --> 28:16.186
a no-holds-barred great literary artist, manages at the same time, in that wonderful 19th-century pre-modernist way, also to be rather remarkably successful.

28:16.206 --> 28:19.954
I'm thinking of people like Garcia Marquez, for example.

28:20.795 --> 28:25.624
A hundred years of solitude or love in the time of cholera float up to the top of the old New York Times.

28:26.125 --> 28:32.357
It's as rare as having a splendid human being win a popular political election.

28:32.377 --> 28:36.846
All that's unthinkable, but now that it happens.

28:38.345 --> 28:40.948
Are you working on a... I was going to say, we've got about another ten.

28:40.968 --> 28:43.772
Are you working on another novel now?

28:43.792 --> 28:44.453
Well, no.

28:44.533 --> 28:47.778
A thing has happened to me that just delights me, Nicholas.

28:47.838 --> 28:54.647
I found when I finished... I got two books out of the house last year, which for me is a remarkable productivity.

28:55.608 --> 29:00.575
Just one, and the other one, I'm cheating, the other one's a second collection of essays.

29:00.595 --> 29:04.159
Most of them have already been published, but Little Brown will bring that out in the fall.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.883
And with that double postpartum,

29:07.353 --> 29:18.644
feeling after getting two books out of the shop in the same calendar year, I found, to my delight and astonishment, that all the ideas that were coming to me were ideas for short stories.

29:18.724 --> 29:22.248
For the first time in 25 years, I'm like a kid with a new toy.

29:23.829 --> 29:36.482
The Lost in the Funhouse stories, which were all written in the first half and the middle 60s, the book was published in 68, was the last time I ever practiced the short form.

29:37.441 --> 29:39.865
And I'm just, I can't get enough of it.

29:39.906 --> 29:43.713
I've been writing with a clip of about one a month for the past six or seven months.

29:43.733 --> 29:44.173
Isn't that great?

29:44.194 --> 29:49.022
It's interesting, from here I go to Grace Paley, who admits I can't write a novel, it's a failure.

29:49.043 --> 29:52.529
I mean, I'd love to see her novel, but it's not a failure.

29:52.549 --> 30:00.664
My own feeling is... Her novel may be the thing, I've got to tease Grace about this one, that says your book, Jack, still keeps saying a novel in the works, a novel in the works.

30:00.644 --> 30:07.718
Well, I think its purpose was to be there so that she could get her short stories written.

30:07.978 --> 30:14.131
And my story, because I am a bookman, I don't care where these stories appear.

30:14.391 --> 30:19.902
The first one appeared in Harper's, three others are appearing, and four others in literary magazines.

30:20.540 --> 30:25.886
But already I'm thinking in terms of the book, and I know now, no short story writer thinks this way.

30:25.906 --> 30:33.916
I know now that there will be 12, and when I've written the 12th one, I'm finished with that, and that's the book, and I know what order they want to be in the book.

30:34.236 --> 30:35.758
Is there a theme for you?

30:35.798 --> 30:40.664
There will be a counterpoint of themes, and some of them we'll have to do.

30:40.684 --> 30:42.125
I was actually inspired by this.

30:42.205 --> 30:43.307
Some of them we'll have to do.

30:43.707 --> 30:46.210
I have been a teacher for too long, I suppose, a coach.

30:46.612 --> 30:52.738
taking cliches of narrative, like formula, like once upon a time or and then one day.

30:52.758 --> 30:55.461
Remember Grace's book, by the way, later that same day?

30:56.282 --> 30:59.285
And then one day, on with the story, et cetera.

30:59.305 --> 31:11.657
Many, in other words, are stories that are, if not about storytelling, because I hope they're not just about that, are inspired or suggested by some of these narrative formulas and so forth.

31:12.127 --> 31:19.877
Others, by matters of little scientific and philosophical conundrums that appeal to me and to which I try to give some human resonation.

31:20.437 --> 31:36.818
The first one, that one in Harford, was called Ad Infinitum, a short story, and it's really based on Zeno's paradox about, the fifth paradox about having, that you can cut a distance, say, in half forever and not get to zero.

31:37.642 --> 31:42.009
And I made that into a story about a woman who has to deliver terrible news to her husband.

31:42.029 --> 31:46.015
And, you know, until she has the news, he doesn't.

31:46.035 --> 31:50.561
Until he gets it, as if everything is still all right.

31:50.581 --> 31:54.127
To get there, she has to cross half the lawn and then half the other lawn.

31:54.728 --> 32:00.036
So a serious situation is even a pathetic one, but structured by that.

32:00.056 --> 32:03.741
Just quickly, because I know you have another friend coming up.

32:03.761 --> 32:06.265
Do you feel that you have to break the ground

32:07.409 --> 32:16.924
I would get bored if, I'm not radical, I don't like the idea of an author feeling that he or she has to reinvent him or herself each time.

32:17.384 --> 32:19.127
That goes, time takes care of that.

32:19.948 --> 32:26.438
But, you know, so I've written three novels, let's say, or four, whatever it is, that involve voyages, for example.

32:26.499 --> 32:28.241
I may have, that may be enough of that.

32:28.682 --> 32:35.172
I thought of this book, by the way, Nicholas, as my last book in the sense that, I think I get said in here too, in the sense that

32:35.557 --> 32:42.686
I hope it'll be the last go-round on certain themes that I've been riffing like an old jazz musician for the last 30 years or so.

32:43.267 --> 32:49.275
One of the reasons why it delights me to find myself doing short stories is that's something new.

32:49.615 --> 32:54.041
And even though some of the echoes, there may be reverberations out of them.

32:54.081 --> 32:56.043
There's that old hand of cards and things again.

32:56.804 --> 33:02.151
But I hope they won't overtly be about sailing or notes in bottles or Scheherazade or things like that.

33:02.552 --> 33:03.673
They will be about

33:04.430 --> 33:17.495
stories as, you know, telling stories as part of living, because I am one with Scheherazade on that, that equation of hearing and, you know, giving and receiving stories as being tantamount to being alive.

33:17.735 --> 33:22.083
And, you know, when we're lost interest in that, we're lost interest in being alive.

33:22.524 --> 33:29.998
That's a great quote to quit on, by the way.
