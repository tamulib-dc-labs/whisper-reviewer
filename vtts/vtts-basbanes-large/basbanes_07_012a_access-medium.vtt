00:02.528 --> 00:31.607
at about the level of 15 candle power under which you would examine these documents and they had books that were open to one page and each day they'd turn a page they don't even turn the page every day which is even worse but as a matter of fact there's no point in having libraries if this is the way the books are to be made available to the people who are interested in them because that is to treat these as if they were pharaohs of Egypt and keep them in the dark so that they can last two or three thousand years

00:32.144 --> 00:55.603
it's more important that those books be used usefully for a usable life, let's say, of five or six hundred years, and that we prepare a photocopy reproduction of them for use by people beyond five hundred years, than that they should, in effect, not be used at all until the end of time.

00:55.870 --> 00:59.236
Of course, those are just the key treasures that they have.

00:59.336 --> 01:00.699
I'm talking about those key treasures.

01:00.899 --> 01:05.187
There's no point in having a key treasure when the creek treasure can't be enjoyed by anybody.

01:05.928 --> 01:15.766
Might as well be a pharaoh stuffed in a box after being wrapped up tightly and kept in the dark inside of some huge architectural structure for a thousand years.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.954
The whole purpose of collecting something is to disturb it.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.906
To disturb it, to turn the pages, to feel it, to look at it, to examine it closely.

01:26.687 --> 01:31.413
And if nobody can examine these things closely, I mean the treasures, then why have them?

01:32.354 --> 01:37.961
See, that's just a perversion of the subject of saving.

01:38.541 --> 01:42.386
Coming from Worcester, you know a perfect example of this in terms of an art gallery.

01:42.826 --> 01:50.295
You had a marvelous collection in Worcester that was given on the donor's death to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

01:50.613 --> 01:54.537
where most of it will go into a cellar and will never be seen by the public again.

01:54.557 --> 02:12.017
I think we ought to have a law in this country that any library or any museum that collects materials shall place those materials on public exhibit at least once every five years or put them up to market so that somebody else can buy them that will meet those conditions.

02:12.798 --> 02:17.363
I didn't expect to get such great stuff right after that.

02:19.182 --> 02:23.066
The special collections here at Boston University basically began when you arrived here.

02:23.547 --> 02:25.589
No, they began before I arrived here.

02:25.769 --> 02:28.292
I cannot take credit for Howard Gottlieb.

02:29.233 --> 02:33.577
He is a wonderful presence at Boston University, but he arrived before I did.

02:33.617 --> 02:45.730
It has been my privilege to support Howard Gottlieb to the fullest extent I could since my arrival, because I saw in Gottlieb the same kind of imagination that had driven Harry Ransom

02:46.334 --> 02:49.717
And Gottlieb has this advantage over Harry Ransom.

02:49.997 --> 02:57.123
He's been able to put together a major collection without the kind of financial support that Harry Ransom enjoyed.

02:57.964 --> 03:01.787
Harry, once he decided to collect something, never had to worry about where the money was coming from.

03:02.428 --> 03:10.215
He had so many wealthy associates and friends in Texas who would supply the money, or he could use state funds to supply the money.

03:10.935 --> 03:15.379
Gottlieb has had to beg, borrow, and I don't think he's ever stolen.

03:15.730 --> 03:19.736
but he had begged and borrowed in order to put together that collection.

03:19.956 --> 03:24.622
But he's done more by persuasion than he has by compensation.

03:27.186 --> 03:33.214
He actually has a special place in my book because he does demonstrate that you can do it without tremendous amounts of money.

03:33.595 --> 03:36.239
And it's not to be equated just with the 20th century either.

03:36.279 --> 03:45.231
That King collection, the Cecil King collection, and the Richards collection, I shouldn't say collection, there are three Richards collections,

03:46.966 --> 03:57.381
Those are major collections for which the University of Texas would, I'm sure, have given millions that Godley got without a penny.

03:58.903 --> 04:02.889
And that's not like collecting the gloves of a movie star or something like that.

04:03.570 --> 04:13.885
Now, the movie collection is, in my opinion, trivialized when people talk just about the dancing shoes of Fred Astaire, for example, because what's much more important is that you have

04:14.287 --> 04:31.245
you have the scenario or you have the text of a movie with an actress's comments in the margins, which gives you a clear indication of how that actor or actress began to interpret the work that they were performing.

04:32.246 --> 04:39.613
Howard said that one thing, one mandate that he's always followed is follow the curriculum.

04:40.754 --> 04:44.158
He won't just collect frivolous things that are wonderful,

04:44.695 --> 04:53.968
But unless there's a course or a school or a department here, and I guess it relates to your thoughts on why we have special collections in universities.

04:53.988 --> 04:55.470
I wonder if you have any thoughts on that.

04:55.591 --> 04:59.656
Well, I think sometimes it's very difficult to anticipate what somebody's going to want to teach a course about.

04:59.677 --> 05:05.505
I wouldn't collect works on astrology just because there was a course offered on it.

05:05.845 --> 05:13.977
If there was a course, a series course offered on astrology as anything but a form of mental pathology or as a historical interlude,

05:14.243 --> 05:21.990
by which the scientific method slowly emerged from mysticism and from mythology, I wouldn't want it at all.

05:23.452 --> 05:28.696
I don't believe in giving a student college credit for taking mythology, I mean astrology, seriously.

05:29.817 --> 05:43.390
To look at it as a human phenomenon is important, but to take it on its own terms is irresponsible, because the reputation of that pretender to knowledge

05:44.112 --> 05:45.233
is more than adequate.

05:45.734 --> 05:46.314
It's complete.

05:47.175 --> 06:02.209
So I don't know how I might very well collect works on astrology as a way of gathering the data for somebody to make a study of that aberrant form of intellectual effort.

06:02.950 --> 06:08.375
But I certainly wouldn't require that somebody be offering a course in it in order to do so.

06:08.395 --> 06:13.360
You basically compete with a few institutions in 20th century, Texas,

06:13.711 --> 06:17.895
I guess, California, UCLA, Illinois, I believe.

06:20.137 --> 06:23.701
Of course, I guess the greatest collection of 20th century stuff is in Texas.

06:24.281 --> 06:27.344
And one of my chapters is so suggested.

06:28.325 --> 06:31.588
One of my chapters, quite frankly, is on the University of Texas.

06:31.649 --> 06:32.730
I spent a week down there.

06:33.711 --> 06:40.377
And I mean, if you're going to study institutional bibliomania, I guess you look at Texas.

06:40.930 --> 06:49.600
Well, in Texas, you know, they have the greatest collection of forgeries in the world, I suppose, too, with those wise forgeries.

06:50.221 --> 06:51.943
The Thomas J. Wise forgeries.

06:52.364 --> 06:52.484
Yeah.

06:52.524 --> 06:55.067
And the funny thing is, they turned out to be very valuable.

06:55.087 --> 06:55.728
In their own right.

06:55.888 --> 07:01.334
They're valuable as a demonstration of how to do it if you decide to do something dishonorable.

07:01.494 --> 07:04.678
Yeah, they predate Harry Ransom like this.

07:04.698 --> 07:04.878
Oh, yeah.

07:04.898 --> 07:07.962
I guess what I'm... But Harry was so criticized for that.

07:08.022 --> 07:09.604
I was there in the period in which

07:10.006 --> 07:17.175
Harry was often criticized for the amount of effort, time, and money that he put into collecting those works.

07:17.236 --> 07:32.976
But I was always a supporter of that because I remember that when I was a graduate student at Yale and a faculty member there, almost every day I went into the Sterling Memorial Library and began reading everything that was on display.

07:34.338 --> 07:38.123
When I discovered James Weldon Johnson's autobiography of an ex-colored man,

07:38.643 --> 07:44.891
It was by reading a yellow foolscap original manuscript of that work in that library.

07:45.912 --> 07:47.274
And I started reading it there.

07:48.235 --> 07:53.181
And then immediately went and got a copy of the work and read it all the way through.

07:53.201 --> 08:00.931
I then read the letters of Jack London and Sinclair Lewis.

08:01.131 --> 08:06.878
Here was London with worlds of experience and short of ideas for plots.

08:07.533 --> 08:12.758
And here was young Sinclair Lewis loaded with ideas for plots and no experience to flesh them out.

08:13.379 --> 08:15.681
And so they created a symbiotic relationship.

08:16.602 --> 08:22.068
And London was paying Sinclair Lewis five dollars for every plot idea that he could use.

08:22.828 --> 08:29.936
And he would get the idea and flesh it out with characters and locations and settings and motivations.

08:30.636 --> 08:37.303
And Sinclair Lewis, who didn't have any of that experience at that stage, could generate plots at apparently a great rate.

08:37.638 --> 08:50.473
As I began studying those documents, and it was adventitious because you never knew what was going to turn up next, I realized how valuable it was to be associated with a university that had that kind of library.

08:50.513 --> 08:54.798
And when I came to Boston University, I looked around.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.101
I couldn't find any cases like that anywhere.

08:57.882 --> 09:06.632
And I remember one of the first things I said was that I saw no possibility of developing that kind of library at Boston University and those kinds of resources.

09:07.270 --> 09:27.610
But for that reason, what I was going to do was recognize that Boston University would supplement the scholarly opportunity for faculty by buying membership in the Widener Library at Harvard for any faculty member who could make significant use of it, and also for graduate students.

09:27.651 --> 09:31.174
And I said, that's a lot less expensive than trying to duplicate that library.

09:32.055 --> 09:33.136
Is that still cold, by the way?

09:33.156 --> 09:36.079
Well, no, no, because there's so many changes that have occurred since.

09:36.295 --> 09:37.276
That still holds.

09:37.456 --> 09:40.379
If somebody needs that, they can do it.

09:40.820 --> 09:44.343
But the collection here is so much better now.

09:44.924 --> 09:46.205
That's my Widener card.

09:46.446 --> 09:47.867
Yeah.

09:48.307 --> 09:54.053
We have well over, you know, we've reached a stage where we have a major library ourselves.

09:54.894 --> 10:00.480
I was incorrect on that by a man who pointed out that Gottlieb was already doing things that were significant.

10:01.338 --> 10:04.522
And I went to see Gottlieb and became acquainted with his collection.

10:04.582 --> 10:10.650
At that time, he had some good colonial stuff on colonial military history and a few things.

10:10.670 --> 10:14.075
And he had the 20th century collection that was just beginning to get started.

10:15.036 --> 10:20.423
And then, but I realized how serious he was and how imaginative he was and how much he'd accomplished.

10:20.463 --> 10:27.672
And he had a significant collection of, oh, what was his name?

10:27.692 --> 10:30.336
Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass and things like that.

10:30.776 --> 10:31.277
And so...

10:31.527 --> 10:36.972
I decided, you know, God leave is a horse to bet on.

10:38.032 --> 10:42.877
And I've done everything I could since then to assist him.

10:43.577 --> 10:54.026
Now, when he pulled in the Cecil King collection, at that point, his collection became a collection of major importance by anybody's standards.

10:54.046 --> 11:01.332
And King, on the occasion that he brought it here, you know, with letters from Churchill and from all the press lords

11:01.885 --> 11:04.747
You know about that Cecil King collection.

11:05.188 --> 11:06.409
Such a brilliant collection.

11:07.890 --> 11:13.535
There was a good deal of comment in the London press about how outraged they were that he was taking this collection out of England.

11:14.476 --> 11:18.259
And so a reporter asked him, said, well, why did you bring it to Boston University?

11:18.279 --> 11:20.021
And he said, well, there are two considerations.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.623
He said, first of all, why did I take it out of England?

11:23.184 --> 11:24.565
He said, remember that I'm an Irishman.

11:26.747 --> 11:28.508
Good answer right after that.

11:28.528 --> 11:31.791
And he said, and secondly, why it's brought to Boston University

11:32.176 --> 11:33.738
because Boston University asked me.

11:35.139 --> 11:41.146
He said, Howard Gottlieb had come to me to initiate this activity.

11:44.490 --> 11:48.154
Can you contrast for me a question of style?

11:48.174 --> 11:53.399
It just occurred to me now, but Howard Gottlieb and Harry Ransom, if you can.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.883
Well, they're both literary types.

11:56.923 --> 12:02.149
They're both people who have written and who write easily and well.

12:02.720 --> 12:09.851
And they are people who also are highly articulate and can talk a great game.

12:11.293 --> 12:12.615
They're both enthusiasts.

12:13.417 --> 12:14.598
They believe in what they're doing.

12:14.638 --> 12:20.207
And they're both extraordinarily imaginative.

12:21.169 --> 12:24.694
I've thought about them being quite similar individuals.

12:25.467 --> 12:35.221
although Harry was much more interested in other areas of education, such as teaching and curriculum building and things of that sort, and institutional building.

12:36.102 --> 12:38.326
When it came to libraries, they're very similar.

12:38.546 --> 12:44.014
And when it comes to the kind of appeal that they could make to an individual, they're remarkably similar.

12:44.475 --> 12:52.386
When you talk to people in Texas or who know about Texas, they always come around to the unorthodox, not illegal,

12:52.805 --> 12:57.372
but unorthodox methods employed by Texas to build this collection.

12:57.513 --> 12:58.975
Well, what was unorthodox about it?

12:58.995 --> 13:03.082
I mean, that money has value is not a Texas invention.

13:03.803 --> 13:07.869
The fact that they decided to spend it is no different from when Morgan was putting together his library.

13:07.929 --> 13:08.751
How the hell did he get it?

13:08.771 --> 13:09.432
He just bought it.

13:10.333 --> 13:17.665
And he bought it with the reckless abandon of a man who would say that if you have to ask what it costs to operate a yacht, you can't afford it.

13:18.320 --> 13:23.748
And if somebody asked him, what did it cost to put together the Morgan Library, I suppose that J.P.

13:23.789 --> 13:26.092
Morgan would have said, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.

13:27.134 --> 13:27.875
He did it with money.

13:27.915 --> 13:30.158
He didn't do it because he was the greatest living scholar.

13:31.000 --> 13:38.832
As Lincoln Stephan said, if he'd left his pants off, if he'd left his pocketbook, when he said he left his pants off, he didn't mean he was naked.

13:39.092 --> 13:46.504
He meant if he didn't have his billfold in his pocket, if he didn't have his money in his pocket, he would be indistinguishable from a butcher.

13:46.670 --> 13:50.695
This is the way Morgan moved.

13:50.735 --> 13:51.516
He moved with money.

13:52.237 --> 13:53.439
Now, Texas moved with money.

13:54.040 --> 14:02.811
It's no longer thought, I mean, the Morgan Library is no longer thought to be vulgar because it's an extraordinary collection, and thank God some rich man put it together.

14:02.851 --> 14:05.574
And I'd say the same thing with regard to Harry Ransom.

14:05.695 --> 14:12.283
I've heard him denigrated as vulgar, and I've heard the Texans denigrated as vulgar because they threw all this oil money around.

14:12.343 --> 14:15.327
Well, that's spending oil money for some damn good purposes.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.323
Now, some of the things that Harry did were severely criticized.

14:20.003 --> 14:24.547
One time he came back from New York with a great crate, and somebody opened the crate and found nothing but dust jackets.

14:25.568 --> 14:30.192
And they said, you paid $10,000 for this whole crate load of dust jackets?

14:31.213 --> 14:40.821
And Harry said, if you would learn more about book collecting, you would find out that any first edition with a dust jacket on it has much greater value than a first edition without a dust jacket.

14:41.301 --> 14:45.465
All he had to do was to fit about 100

14:45.817 --> 14:57.252
of the maybe 25,000 dust jackets that were in that crate to their first editions in order to recover the $10,000 just by the enhanced value of the first edition.

14:58.153 --> 15:07.446
He is described as, by the way, I agree with Warren Roberts in that New York Times piece that I wrote, that money is only money, and you have to get the stuff when you can.

15:07.966 --> 15:10.530
And if anything, it's increased in value.

15:10.590 --> 15:11.571
It hasn't depreciated.

15:11.720 --> 15:12.181
Sure.

15:12.421 --> 15:19.211
And so I, for one, have been through HRC, and I really am a great fan of what they've been.

15:19.231 --> 15:20.232
That was a desert.

15:20.332 --> 15:31.448
When I went to Texas, I couldn't find as much in the way of collections, except those damned forgeries, as I could find at Boston University when I came here in 1971.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.512
Harry Ranson transformed that place.

15:34.532 --> 15:39.499
When I came to Texas, I couldn't look through cases and see the interesting things I saw in the Sterling Memorial Library.

15:40.492 --> 15:55.432
But when I left Texas in 1970, after having been there for 16 years, you could have just as wonderful experience in Harry Ransom's Humanities Research Center as you could in the Sterling Memorial Library, because the manuscripts were there.

15:56.193 --> 16:09.030
Now, there was some ostentatious silliness, I suppose, when you recreate the study of a mystery writer, you know, board for board,

16:09.365 --> 16:11.107
That's a little bizarre.

16:12.428 --> 16:13.769
It didn't hurt anything, really.

16:13.789 --> 16:21.297
I guess the question is, was the Gardner collection worth going to the trouble for all that?

16:21.317 --> 16:22.818
You know, they did a lot of rooms down there.

16:22.838 --> 16:29.285
That was one of the perks that they offered Alfred Knopf, who brought his wonderful library there.

16:29.365 --> 16:30.626
Alfred Knopf's was well worth it.

16:30.646 --> 16:36.993
I don't think there's any doubt about that, whether Earl Stanley Gardner's was worth it or not.

16:37.013 --> 16:39.355
I don't know, but it's bizarre.

16:39.655 --> 17:03.676
to the extent that you want to do something in a major way with murder mysteries, and with that genre for anybody, it was a way of anchoring a national center in that regard, and probably guaranteed the manuscripts of a very large number of mystery writers, either for nothing or for a very reasonable price.

17:03.696 --> 17:05.397
Was Harry a man of vision, in your view?

17:06.058 --> 17:06.979
Extraordinary vision.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.561
Extraordinary vision and extraordinary

17:10.098 --> 17:16.526
As I said many years ago about Harry Ransom, his strength was in his ignorance of the human modalities.

17:17.007 --> 17:22.734
He didn't know the difference between what was necessary, what was possible, what was impossible.

17:23.415 --> 17:34.729
And consequently, he would do things that reasonable people would have concluded were impossible and not worth trying to do because he just didn't understand those modal relationships.

17:35.790 --> 17:38.874
And he was imaginative.

17:38.894 --> 17:39.835
He liked an idea.

17:40.304 --> 17:42.788
he would usually stick his neck out for it.

17:43.589 --> 17:48.456
I remember the first major report I did as a faculty member for Harry Ransom.

17:48.696 --> 17:54.044
I did it in collaboration with Roger Shattuck for the revision of the curriculum of Plan II.

17:55.165 --> 18:04.418
And when we submitted this long document to Harry, he read it, and his comment was, this is a splendid report with an engaging touch of the totally impossible.

18:06.661 --> 18:08.324
And this is the way it was.

18:08.344 --> 18:09.906
The fact that it seemed to him

18:10.223 --> 18:19.152
on the fringe of impossibility, didn't in any way repel him, because he thought, well, this is so wonderful, now how could we make it happen?

18:19.913 --> 18:24.958
And then he would try to make it happen, and maybe he didn't achieve all of it, but he would achieve a great deal of it.

18:25.618 --> 18:35.488
Another very frequent criticism of Harry Ransom was that he didn't keep his promises, that he was always breaking his promises, and there was a good deal of truth in it.

18:35.941 --> 18:41.146
But the reason there was a great deal of truth in it is that Harry would promise anything to damn near anybody.

18:41.887 --> 18:47.553
Harry was a man who had difficulty in saying no to any idea that had any merit whatsoever.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.576
And consequently, he would promise more than he could deliver.

18:51.557 --> 18:55.482
But the good news was that Harry delivered about 60% of the time.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.905
And that meant that 40% of the time, he didn't deliver.

18:59.986 --> 19:03.450
But he promised maybe 1,000 times more

19:04.105 --> 19:06.128
than an ordinary person would have.

19:06.528 --> 19:15.380
So out of the 60% of the time that people got what they wanted, probably not more than one-third of them would have got what they wanted from anybody else.

19:15.941 --> 19:22.670
Warren Robertson, I don't think I used that quote, this quote in that piece, he described it, and I must say affectionately, as a con man.

19:22.750 --> 19:26.355
He said he was able to get anything he wanted from the Board of Regents.

19:26.395 --> 19:27.396
Would you agree with that?

19:28.726 --> 19:33.070
Well, he could get a lot from them, not because he was a con man, but because he was extraordinary.

19:33.090 --> 19:37.394
He said the man could talk the pants off, you know, whatever the expression might be.

19:38.055 --> 19:48.044
Well, you see, it's very similar to a remark that was made to me by Abe Sacher, Abraham Sacher, the founding president of Brandeis University.

19:49.466 --> 19:57.433
He said, for the first 10 years of my presidency, I did not know whether I was the highly successful president

19:58.072 --> 20:16.377
of the first university sponsored by the Jewish community or whether I was the most flagrant con man to come down the pike because I was promising and committing to this, that, and the other without any way of knowing whether I'd be able to deliver on what I was promising.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.281
Now, I think that's inevitable.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.682
I think that goes with the territory.

20:22.986 --> 20:26.290
That goes with the territory of every builder, every innovator.

20:28.025 --> 20:36.939
You know, I've talked to the trustees about making Boston University excellent without being able to demonstrate its possibility.

20:36.979 --> 20:38.000
I just had a conviction.

20:38.761 --> 20:45.151
And it takes the conviction and working on the conviction to turn what's a possibility and a very dubious possibility into a reality.

20:45.972 --> 20:47.214
And that's what Harry did.

20:49.237 --> 20:54.285
What distinguishes Harry Ransom from a con man is there was nothing personal in it for him.

20:54.603 --> 20:56.045
That's the same thing is true of Abe Tacker.

20:56.065 --> 20:57.627
That's very important, by the way.

20:57.927 --> 20:58.508
Fundamental.

20:59.309 --> 21:11.345
In fact, I will disprove in my book a very scurrilous allegation made by Charles Hamilton in New York that Harry and Lou Feldman, the book dealer, made millions of dollars buying and selling books.

21:11.485 --> 21:13.848
There's just absolutely no foundation for that allegation.

21:13.888 --> 21:16.351
I even found out where he got that information.

21:16.391 --> 21:19.896
He got it from a former maid of Lou Feldman's.

21:20.537 --> 21:23.040
But anyway, I will disprove that assertion in my book.

21:23.729 --> 21:25.612
But that's a very important point to make.

21:25.832 --> 21:32.903
If Harry Ransom did make millions, nobody ever found him spending it.

21:35.187 --> 21:37.110
And his wife didn't become rich on his death.

21:37.490 --> 21:38.632
So what the hell happened to it?

21:38.852 --> 21:44.421
I just want to make the point that I will be disproving that.

21:45.498 --> 21:47.420
scandal, a libelous allegation.

21:47.460 --> 21:51.284
When did that libelous allegation first come?

21:51.304 --> 22:01.614
It's appeared in one instance in a book published by Charles Hamilton about ten years ago in a book called The Auctioneers, published by— That's after Harry was dead?

22:01.915 --> 22:02.275
Oh, yeah.

22:02.295 --> 22:07.360
Well, I've interviewed Hamilton on this, and I asked him where he got his information, and he told me, and he wouldn't name the person.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.062
I found out who the person is.

22:09.082 --> 22:12.265
But he hated Ransom, and he hated Feldman.

22:12.802 --> 22:14.805
This Hamilton is the guy who's, you know, who he is.

22:14.825 --> 22:15.546
He's in New York.

22:15.926 --> 22:20.171
He writes the books about forgeries, and he's the expert on autographs.

22:20.352 --> 22:23.015
But I can get a copy of it.

22:23.035 --> 22:28.042
In fact, they gave me a copy of the thing down in Texas, and I just disproved it point for point.

22:28.142 --> 22:29.864
This is not a big deal.

22:29.984 --> 22:38.896
I just want to make the point that Harry, from everything I've been able to learn, did not profit personally from what he did in Texas.

22:38.956 --> 22:40.277
A lot of people have alleged that.

22:40.357 --> 22:42.420
And neither has Gottlieb.

22:42.738 --> 22:45.621
I wouldn't even mention that in the same context.

22:46.042 --> 22:49.606
That's never even been hinted that Howard has.

22:50.246 --> 22:53.730
I guess... But I think that's required of a con man.

22:54.871 --> 23:07.185
I mean, all of us stick our necks out on behalf of good causes and make promises and commitments on behalf of good causes without any assurance that all those promises can be fulfilled.

23:07.205 --> 23:09.808
That's inevitable for any builder.

23:11.341 --> 23:15.187
It's been suggested that you came into Texas as one of Harry's protégés.

23:15.207 --> 23:15.667
That's right.

23:15.827 --> 23:16.408
Absolutely true.

23:16.488 --> 23:17.610
I was one of Harry's boys.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.633
That's the way they referred to us, Harry's boys.

23:20.174 --> 23:24.099
William R. Smith, Roger Shattuck, myself, a few others.

23:25.241 --> 23:28.085
And there's also been speculation about why you left in 1970.

23:28.346 --> 23:32.311
And I want me to tell you what I hear, and maybe you can disprove it for me.

23:33.453 --> 23:37.679
And this is very simplistic, but it's what people say.

23:39.001 --> 23:39.762
Dr. Silber...

23:40.130 --> 23:41.412
wanted to build faculty.

23:42.634 --> 23:44.737
Mr. Irwin wanted to build buildings.

23:45.819 --> 23:46.359
Conflict.

23:47.161 --> 23:59.319
Harry Ransom, in the meantime, was devoted to you, respected you, but at the same time, he had this vision, he had this obsession to build HRC, and he was forced to make a choice.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.604
It didn't have anything to do with the HRC, but he had to make the choice.

24:03.065 --> 24:05.028
But is there truth to any of that?

24:05.128 --> 24:05.448
Sure.

24:05.689 --> 24:08.533
There's a lot of truth to that, but it's more specific than that.

24:08.969 --> 24:38.217
I also, in trying to pursue the interest of building the faculty, was presided over a meeting of the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences, which was the largest faculty by far at the University of Texas, and we had more than 50% of all the students at the University of Texas, and that faculty voted that the size of the university should not exceed 35,000, that also in earlier years, before I was dean, voted it should not exceed 30,000, and earlier than that, that it should not exceed 25,000.

24:38.821 --> 24:40.783
And it shouldn't have.

24:40.903 --> 24:56.502
About 25,000 is where they should have stopped because there began to be a breakdown in educational quality and in the contact beyond departments, between departments and between colleges, between the law school and the College of Arts and Sciences and so forth.

24:56.982 --> 25:08.035
And so I presided over a meeting which the faculty voted virtually unanimously that the university should not grow beyond 35,000.

25:08.926 --> 25:15.632
Frank Irwin called me into a meeting with the president.

25:15.652 --> 25:27.422
It was also at a time where I had wanted to create a residential college at the University of Texas by taking four dormitories that were built in a quadrangle and turning them into a residential college along the Yale model.

25:29.064 --> 25:31.906
And the president had turned me down on that, said we didn't have the money.

25:31.966 --> 25:38.832
So I went to Gib Denman in San Antonio and got the money from him to do it through a foundation that Gib Denman was running.

25:39.571 --> 25:43.657
I came back to the president, said that here I had the money, would like to start this residential college.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.263
Well, I got the call from Irwin, came to a meeting.

25:47.283 --> 25:49.066
Norman Hackerman was there.

25:49.106 --> 25:49.947
Irwin was there.

25:49.987 --> 25:54.173
And he says, I understand that there's a conflict between you and the president that I have to resolve.

25:55.876 --> 25:56.517
I said, what's that?

25:57.298 --> 26:04.049
He said, well, I understand that you intend to build a residential college and the president has vetoed it.

26:04.870 --> 26:07.654
And that you've gone ahead and raised the money and intend to do it.

26:08.495 --> 26:09.857
I said, no, that's not my understanding.

26:09.877 --> 26:14.204
My understanding is that the president told me that he liked the idea, but that he didn't have the money.

26:14.985 --> 26:18.290
And I went out and got the money, and I presume the president likes the idea.

26:20.293 --> 26:24.460
And he said, well, that's not my understanding, and Hackerman is sitting right there not saying a goddamn thing.

26:25.682 --> 26:35.717
And I said, now, if I'm misinformed on that, and if the president is opposed to this idea, and he doesn't want the residential college, then I will return the money.

26:36.001 --> 26:39.047
But I said, there is no conflict between the president and me on this issue.

26:39.969 --> 26:42.453
I wasn't about to get myself fired over an issue like that.

26:42.474 --> 26:43.876
Is this about 69?

26:44.097 --> 26:46.962
This was about, yeah, about the fall of 69.

26:47.102 --> 26:56.601
I got fired in the summer of 70, but it'd be the fall of 69, about September of 69, or October, somewhere along there.

26:56.661 --> 26:58.785
He said, I also understand that you've...

27:00.031 --> 27:06.157
You've been presiding over a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in which you voted that the university shouldn't increase beyond 35,000.

27:06.257 --> 27:12.963
He said, when that happens, I think it's time to fire the dean and break up the college.

27:14.485 --> 27:22.032
And I said, I think it's time to recognize the conflict of interest that you have with the interests of this university.

27:22.272 --> 27:28.958
I said, the quality of instruction and education in this university is beginning to deteriorate because it's getting too large in order to have the kind of

27:29.140 --> 27:35.367
interplay between faculty and colleges and departments that is necessary for a first-rate education.

27:36.228 --> 27:48.322
And because we continue to expand, we dilute the influence of our endowment, and we continually are expending our substance on buildings, more buildings, more buildings, and the quality of instruction is going down.

27:49.042 --> 27:55.750
And I said that is not the way to build a university of the first class, and the Constitution of the state of Texas calls for a university of the first class.

27:56.891 --> 27:58.573
And that's not fulfilling the obligation.

27:58.840 --> 28:05.886
But you and your associates on the Board of Trustees are buying land all around this campus and building high-rise condominiums and dormitories on it.

28:06.807 --> 28:14.694
And obviously, if you continue to expand the university, you can make millions on that because you can guarantee the occupancy in all those structures.

28:16.235 --> 28:19.118
And I said, don't you see that as a serious conflict of interest?

28:19.658 --> 28:28.206
And he looked at me over these half-glasses and he says, and by the way, and Irwin liked me personally, and I liked him personally, so it was not personal at all.

28:28.608 --> 28:31.431
We never had a crossword on any personal issue at all.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.995
He shook his head and he said, John, you'll never learn.

28:35.496 --> 28:38.119
Where there is no conflict, there is no interest.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.983
Now, that line belongs in Bartlett.

28:41.003 --> 28:42.624
Yeah.

28:42.644 --> 28:44.166
It's wonderful.

28:44.607 --> 28:48.672
And so I knew from that point on that he was going to fire me.

28:49.272 --> 28:51.555
And I zigged and zagged and zigged and zagged.

28:51.575 --> 28:55.299
And he zapped me about the 24th of July of 1970.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.602
Now, where was Harry in all this?

28:57.886 --> 28:59.528
Did Harry kind of— Harry lay low.

28:59.949 --> 29:04.274
And Harry was at the meeting of the regents after I was fired.

29:04.334 --> 29:09.281
I attended the meeting of the Board of Regents, and I'd been fired.

29:10.122 --> 29:14.568
But I got on the agenda of it because they also put on the agenda breaking up the College of Arts and Sciences.

29:15.789 --> 29:25.682
And I was advised by faculty that petitions were signed by faculty and by 7,000 students in the middle of the summer, opposing my being fired.

29:26.236 --> 29:30.781
But I was offered a resignation, but I didn't choose to resign.

29:30.821 --> 29:34.365
I insisted that if they remove me, they'd have to fire me to do it.

29:35.807 --> 29:42.515
But I went down there and I said, look, I'm not arguing with your decision to terminate me as dean.

29:42.715 --> 29:43.556
I said, I accept that.

29:44.237 --> 29:52.366
But having accepted this, since the only reason for breaking up the college was to get rid of me as dean, you don't have to break up the college because I'm gone.

29:54.148 --> 29:55.990
Now, if you break up the College of Arts and Sciences,

29:56.678 --> 30:00.163
You will separate the humanities, the social sciences, and the physical sciences.

30:00.704 --> 30:03.788
And that is a way to undermine the strength of all these branches.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.852
The humanities need the sciences and the social sciences.

30:07.433 --> 30:08.895
The social sciences need both.

30:09.416 --> 30:13.962
And the physical sciences definitely need the access to the humanities.

30:14.182 --> 30:16.586
And I said that is not the way to improve this university.

30:16.686 --> 30:26.179
It's a way to reduce the quality of instruction here to that of a technologically-oriented institution instead of a world-class university.

30:26.463 --> 30:27.044
I'm gone.

30:27.344 --> 30:28.606
I'm not going to argue that decision.

30:29.607 --> 30:33.692
But I want to fight for the decision to leave the college intact.

30:34.072 --> 30:34.493
What happened?

30:35.013 --> 30:36.295
They voted to break up the college.

30:36.976 --> 30:46.668
And Harry Ransom, and I mentioned my conflict with Irwin, and Irwin turned beet red, just turned beet red.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.411
He was embarrassed by it.

30:49.431 --> 30:55.238
And I said, you don't have to pursue this conflict.

30:55.690 --> 30:57.573
Harry held his head in his hands.

30:58.714 --> 30:59.395
He said nothing.

31:00.056 --> 31:05.343
When the meeting was over, Harry came up to me to say how sorry he was.

31:06.745 --> 31:09.709
And I said, he had tears in his eyes.

31:10.791 --> 31:12.773
I said, I understand, Harry.

31:13.955 --> 31:17.440
I said, you've just been put through the last act of Titus Andronicus.

31:18.481 --> 31:20.183
You just proceeded in hand.

31:21.525 --> 31:24.229
I said, you had your child served up for dinner.

31:24.918 --> 31:33.450
How much time have we got, Doctor?

31:33.470 --> 31:33.950
Fifteen minutes?

31:34.111 --> 31:35.733
No, well, maybe five.

31:35.933 --> 31:36.955
Okay.

31:38.176 --> 31:39.698
But that's the way it ended.

31:40.560 --> 31:40.740
Okay.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.083
Do you think Harry could have saved you?

31:43.343 --> 31:44.205
Yeah.

31:44.225 --> 31:53.237
Do you think there's any credence to the suggestion that maybe he made the devil's deal with Frank Irwin, that Frank said, I won't fool around with your acquisitions?

31:53.757 --> 31:58.342
No, I think it was something more serious than that.

31:58.362 --> 31:59.343
And what might that have been?

31:59.363 --> 32:00.525
I'm not going to speculate on it.

32:03.588 --> 32:14.380
But I think that Harry, in some sense, was vulnerable and in a way that Frank Irving was aware of.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.562
And that's what stayed his hand.

32:15.882 --> 32:17.023
I think he just about killed Harry.

32:17.304 --> 32:22.870
But you definitely think that he, without suggesting what it might have been,

32:23.170 --> 32:26.635
You think that he probably presented something to Harry and said, stay out of this?

32:26.835 --> 32:29.739
Yeah.

32:29.819 --> 32:36.388
I think that he made it clear to Harry that if he tried to defend me, he was gone.

32:36.408 --> 32:37.149
Harry was gone?

32:37.309 --> 32:37.930
Harry was gone.

32:38.931 --> 32:39.091
Wow.

32:40.613 --> 32:41.815
And that he had the means to do it.

32:43.557 --> 32:49.245
And this is just something intuitive in your part, or you base it on something that you... No, I base it on something.

32:51.385 --> 32:55.510
Do you think it's worth my pursuing in other areas, or would I be best advised to leave it alone?

32:55.610 --> 32:56.892
Is it something I'm likely to find?

32:57.953 --> 32:58.994
I could say that off the record.

32:59.014 --> 32:59.875
I'm just curious.

33:00.076 --> 33:00.676
I don't know.

33:00.697 --> 33:02.639
I think it'll be hard for you to find.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.102
That's probably not even worth getting, right?

33:05.142 --> 33:09.988
Because I'm writing a book about book collections.

33:10.008 --> 33:10.809
I'll shut the thing off.

33:10.829 --> 33:14.373
I mean, we're basically done.

33:14.734 --> 33:17.197
I know Harry Ransom very well, and I know Frank Irwin very well.

33:17.397 --> 33:21.342
And I know that Frank Irwin always looked for people's weaknesses so that he could exploit them.

33:22.418 --> 33:50.282
And when I became dean, I immediately sold a property interest I had in a high-rise dormitory, the Dovey House at the University of Texas, because the developer of that project had invited me to be an investor and wanted me to assume the responsibility of turning that high-rise dormitory into a residential college and to offer academic programs and to have

33:50.667 --> 33:57.174
and to select faculty fellows to be associated with it who would eat their meals at the Dobie House and provide education.

33:57.795 --> 34:10.329
When I became dean, I immediately sold my interest, instantly, because I intended, now I was in a position to create such residential colleges on the part of the university.

34:11.010 --> 34:15.154
Before, I had tried without success, and so I was quite happy to do it with a private investor.

34:15.615 --> 34:19.459
Now, as dean, I had the opportunity to do it with university facilities,

34:20.030 --> 34:22.914
And I said it would be a conflict of interest and I must divest.

34:23.415 --> 34:23.915
So I did.

34:25.057 --> 34:30.164
It shocked President Hackerman when I informed him that I had divested.

34:31.686 --> 34:32.868
He said, why did you do that for?

34:34.450 --> 34:36.312
And I said, so it would not be a string attached.

34:37.895 --> 34:46.747
I think that when Frank Irwin found out that I had divested in that, that was a bad mark against me as far as he was concerned.

34:46.967 --> 34:49.851
Because it meant that silver is squeaky clean.

34:50.084 --> 34:53.328
Let's conclude with two fast questions.

34:53.348 --> 34:56.312
You gave me a characterization of Harry Ransom.

34:56.693 --> 34:58.315
Give me a characterization of Frank Irwin.

34:58.976 --> 35:11.472
Frank Irwin was a very intelligent, very ambitious man with a very limited education who knew almost nothing about what was required to have a great university.

35:11.692 --> 35:15.417
But he was very, very smart, and he was politically astute.

35:16.004 --> 35:19.929
And his idea for a university was an enormous structure, apparently.

35:19.949 --> 35:34.986
Well, yeah, and a great football team, and a great basketball team, and a great baseball team, and a great baseball park, and a great football stadium, and a great basketball stadium, which they appropriately named in memory of Frank Irwin.

35:35.026 --> 35:39.772
And if Harry wanted a Bibliothèque Nationale on the campus of Austin, that was all right, too.

35:39.792 --> 35:40.472
Sure, that was all right.

35:41.113 --> 35:41.614
That was all right.

35:41.634 --> 35:42.375
He liked that, too.

35:43.616 --> 35:45.218
And do you...

35:45.620 --> 35:49.525
Are you pleased at the way things have turned out with your life?

35:49.605 --> 35:51.307
I mean, you left Texas?

35:52.488 --> 36:07.225
Well, if I had known that I would not remain in Texas, and could not have one day been the president of the University of Texas to achieve the destiny of that school, which should by this time be well recognized as the greatest university in the world.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.347
It had no excuses.

36:08.767 --> 36:09.388
It had the money.

36:10.029 --> 36:11.190
It just didn't have the direction.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.792
And the direction

36:13.396 --> 36:31.805
that it did have that was given it by first Logan Wilson and then especially by Harry Ransom was muted in the last years of Harry Ransom's chancellorship by Frank Irwin and then terminated when Frank Irwin proceeded to get rid of Norman Hackerman and get rid of me.

36:32.647 --> 36:36.293
People may deny that he got rid of Norman Hackerman, but that's just their ignorance.

36:36.313 --> 36:39.758
He sold Norman Hackerman to Rice University

36:40.497 --> 36:43.182
And this is no criticism of Norman Hackleman.

36:43.242 --> 36:47.570
He was a fine man and a very able scientist, and he made a great president of Rice.

36:48.912 --> 36:50.695
But it wasn't his idea of going to Rice.

36:51.717 --> 37:01.294
He had the choice of being canned at the University of Texas or going to Rice, and his appointment at Rice was arranged by Frank Irwin.

37:01.314 --> 37:04.540
Did you expect that you would be the president of the University of Texas?

37:04.560 --> 37:04.800
Sure, I did.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.793
And the intention was to make it not one of the finest.

37:10.294 --> 37:11.195
The finest.

37:11.335 --> 37:11.795
The finest.

37:11.975 --> 37:14.138
And you have no doubts that that would have happened?

37:14.718 --> 37:16.880
I think it was very likely to have happened.

37:17.581 --> 37:21.465
Certainly, it would be recognized right now as if any place was better, it would have been Harvard.

37:23.426 --> 37:24.047
Maybe Harvard.

37:24.307 --> 37:28.351
MIT in certain areas would be as good as the University of Texas, but not substantially better.

37:28.892 --> 37:35.378
And there would be areas in which the University of Texas would be flourishing, and MIT and Harvard would scarcely exist.

37:37.282 --> 37:38.243
It's a good one to quit on.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.685
You're very happy with it.

37:40.086 --> 37:41.388
You've done wonders here, however.

37:41.428 --> 37:44.533
Yeah, but we start so much later.

37:44.793 --> 37:50.501
When I came to Boston University, it reminded me very much of the way Texas was about 1948.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.724
That was in 1970.

37:54.467 --> 38:02.639
And I remember when I thought that Boston University was about to reach the quality that Texas was in 1955 when I came.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.483
And then it was...

38:05.648 --> 38:11.356
Boston University is now approaching the standards that Texas had reached when I left.

38:12.518 --> 38:17.485
I think the English department here is vastly superior to the English department of Texas then or now.

38:19.288 --> 38:26.158
The philosophy department is not yet as good as the philosophy department I left at the University of Texas but it's getting there and I think within two or three years it'll be there.

38:27.319 --> 38:33.208
The physics department here is much smaller than the Texas department but in the areas in which we exist we are

38:33.610 --> 38:35.693
Top flight, absolutely top flight.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.476
Of course, they have state money, and you don't.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.798
And that makes it tough.

38:39.459 --> 38:42.524
Chemistry is by no means as good here as it was there.

38:43.525 --> 38:45.748
Biology is not as good as it was there.

38:46.730 --> 38:50.576
But in history, I think we're at least as good.

38:51.257 --> 38:53.600
And in mathematics, I think we're better.

38:53.620 --> 38:57.626
In computer science, I think we compare very favorably.

38:59.029 --> 39:01.272
We're not as strong in the foreign languages.

39:01.623 --> 39:04.628
We're stronger, of course, in religion and theology, which you have none.

39:05.289 --> 39:15.587
I think our medical program does very well, and our dental program, these are comparable, different size, but comparable in the area of music.

39:15.627 --> 39:18.271
I think we're stronger in theater.

39:18.291 --> 39:21.156
I think we're at least as strong as Texas was.

39:21.717 --> 39:22.298
One other question.

39:22.548 --> 39:29.439
It was also suggested that Erwin was fearful that you were building a political base around yourself.

39:29.479 --> 39:30.561
I don't think there's any doubt about it.

39:30.601 --> 39:49.551
I think that he told Rabbi Olin, a Dallas rabbi, that he was going to fire me in September of 1970, the evening that I attended a fundraiser that was organized by the Arts and Sciences Foundation.

39:49.868 --> 39:51.209
by Annette Strauss.

39:51.249 --> 39:54.012
Annette Strauss was a sister-in-law of Robert Strauss, by the way.

39:55.253 --> 40:02.761
And she was a member of my Arts and Sciences Council and brought together an audience of some of the richest people in Texas.

40:03.582 --> 40:08.687
That audience was probably at a net worth of maybe $3 billion back in 1970.

40:09.548 --> 40:11.570
And, I mean, 1969.

40:11.730 --> 40:14.372
I went ahead and they headed to Turtle Creek Country Club.

40:15.313 --> 40:16.214
And I spoke to it.

40:16.274 --> 40:18.897
Harriet Hackman attended.

40:19.754 --> 40:21.976
And what do you know?

40:23.037 --> 40:28.141
Frank Irwin, unannounced, appeared along with Ben Barnes, the Attorney General.

40:29.282 --> 40:30.503
I mean, the Lieutenant Governor.

40:31.244 --> 40:36.208
And Ben Barnes said to me, this is the heaviest group of people ever assembled on behalf of the University of Texas.

40:38.050 --> 40:41.913
Ackerman introduced me that night with no great generosity.

40:42.093 --> 40:45.616
Silver does lots of things that I like.

40:45.637 --> 40:49.660
He does lots of things that I don't like, but he certainly is, you know, somebody to

40:49.943 --> 41:04.202
to hear from, and I got up and made, without notes, a speech that most people there perceived as not only delightful, but brilliant, and informative, and totally supportive of Hackerman and the university.

41:04.983 --> 41:11.612
And I got a standing ovation out of those, and at that point, Harry Ransom turns to Rabbi Olin and says, I'm going to fire that son of a bitch.

41:12.874 --> 41:13.735
Harry Ransom said?

41:14.136 --> 41:14.776
No, I'm sorry.

41:14.957 --> 41:15.758
Frank Irwin.

41:16.018 --> 41:16.959
She said Harry Ransom.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.740
I'm sorry, no.

41:17.841 --> 41:19.663
Frank Irwin said, I'm going to fire him.

41:20.150 --> 41:29.305
And Rabbi Olin caught an airplane the following Monday to Austin to tell me about that conversation because he was that worried about it.

41:29.806 --> 41:34.613
Now, Frank Herwin didn't care at all that I was liberal.

41:35.635 --> 41:46.933
That didn't bother him in the least, that I had supported integration of the University of Texas, that I had supported the rights of black students, that I had supported the rights of Hispanic students, that I was working out scholarship funds to benefit those kids.

41:47.453 --> 41:58.806
that I was working with the black schools in Austin, Texas, and helping with the integration of the university and of schools, that I was the first president of the Texas Society to abolish capital punishment.

41:59.227 --> 42:02.971
None of that bothered him at all, except it was something he could use.

42:03.792 --> 42:07.236
Now, always to be sure that I didn't go anywhere.

42:08.357 --> 42:10.239
And he used it when he decided to fire me.

42:10.259 --> 42:15.165
He tried to let the word out that I was this communist that they had to worry about.

42:15.753 --> 42:26.085
But as a matter of fact, what really triggered his action was that I was gaining support from a very well-to-do center in Texas politics.

42:27.126 --> 42:29.749
And it meant that if I continued there, I'd no longer be controllable.

42:30.951 --> 42:32.693
I don't think there's any question about that.

42:32.713 --> 42:35.796
Did you have political aspirations in Texas?

42:36.497 --> 42:41.423
I thought about politics and political office in Texas, but I had not discussed it with anybody.

42:42.095 --> 42:46.804
And that's one of the reasons why I have a lot of respect for Frank Irwin.

42:47.605 --> 42:56.281
He figured out what my long-range intentions were without ever asking me or without ever discussing it with me or without my ever having discussed it with anybody.

42:58.505 --> 43:04.035
That's why, you know, I have a good deal of respect for somebody who can...

43:04.235 --> 43:06.718
read somebody else as clearly as he read me.

43:06.918 --> 43:13.245
But what he overlooked was the fact that I was doing the state a lot of good and the university a lot of good.

43:13.806 --> 43:16.469
In the meantime, he didn't help the situation at all by getting rid of me.

43:18.752 --> 43:21.435
But he's a guy like Lyndon Johnson.

43:21.635 --> 43:23.337
He trusted no one that he couldn't control.

43:24.238 --> 43:26.120
And he didn't want anybody around that he couldn't control.

43:26.180 --> 43:32.908
And if Harry Ransom had not been controllable, Harry wouldn't have been around.

43:33.935 --> 43:39.768
And one of the reasons why I wanted to get rid of Norm Hackerman is that Norm Hackerman was a marvelously honest and independent man.

43:40.569 --> 43:44.278
And not easy to control, because there were no flies on Norm Hackerman.

43:46.282 --> 43:47.124
Unrelated to Texas.

43:47.144 --> 43:48.707
You going to give it another shot up here?

43:50.231 --> 43:52.315
Oh, no, Mike.
