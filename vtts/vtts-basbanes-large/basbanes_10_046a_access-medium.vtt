WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:07.342
And we're talking to Mrs. Goldsmith.

00:08.303 --> 00:15.073
I think as an explanation to you, I would like to mention of your husband in this book that I'm writing.

00:15.093 --> 00:20.762
And I want to have a chapter on the role played by the emigre booksellers.

00:20.782 --> 00:21.503
Yes.

00:21.523 --> 00:27.571
And, you know, everyone mentions how enormously influential your husband was.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.696
Well, I must say he's been sort of

00:31.081 --> 00:40.631
looked even now that he's dead four years ago, people still talk about him, because he really left a mark.

00:40.651 --> 00:48.039
You see, we had a rather interesting kind of shop, which was very European in a way.

00:48.760 --> 01:00.632
It was open to the public, and we had not only rare books, but we had, they were mainly European, but we had original prints and drawings

01:01.203 --> 01:02.865
Some autographs, some musicals.

01:02.885 --> 01:04.687
It was sort of varied.

01:05.628 --> 01:07.551
And we often had many shows.

01:08.432 --> 01:13.498
We had some of Jacques Villon and other people like that.

01:14.359 --> 01:20.046
Eric at the Gloria Club faxed me some stories on this.

01:20.106 --> 01:24.732
And so I saw John Russell's piece in the New York Times when the shop closed.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.035
And he said, this is so sad.

01:27.075 --> 01:29.438
This is such a great place because it's...

01:29.688 --> 01:39.683
As you mentioned, it was a bookshop, it was a drawing room, and it was... Well, it was open, and we had people that came in, and we had like Philip Hofer, whom you probably know.

01:39.924 --> 01:40.184
Of course.

01:40.425 --> 01:43.409
He used to come in, and they all felt very much at home.

01:43.890 --> 01:50.380
Barite was also one of our customers, and when we had something, we used to call them or write a letter.

01:50.981 --> 01:52.683
Well, that doesn't exist anymore.

01:52.744 --> 01:55.628
Now you have to press on the button in order to get in.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.790
And everything has changed, and the customers have changed.

02:00.531 --> 02:05.556
Now, tell me how important scholarship was to your husband, how important it was for him to study.

02:06.917 --> 02:12.222
I've read a few pieces of how he spent so much time at the library and checking in.

02:12.242 --> 02:13.263
Oh, yes, everything.

02:13.363 --> 02:23.573
When he gave lectures, he gave the four-timer lecture and also the Malkin lecture at Columbia.

02:24.076 --> 02:27.802
He made so much research, you have no idea.

02:28.362 --> 02:39.399
Because when he came in front of his public, not a word was malpronounced, not a word was hesitation and all that, which is rather rare with booksellers.

02:39.499 --> 02:42.984
They don't know how to express themselves.

02:43.004 --> 02:44.486
Publicly, certainly.

02:44.526 --> 02:46.870
No, no, I've noticed that.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.793
They don't have this gift.

02:48.813 --> 02:52.378
But Lucien had this sort of acting with him.

02:52.595 --> 03:01.708
which was very enjoyable, because when we had people socially for meals, for supper, you know, we had some very interesting talks.

03:01.728 --> 03:03.310
Now, he was born in Brussels.

03:03.330 --> 03:03.610
Yes.

03:03.770 --> 03:05.733
And he was educated in Berlin, is that right?

03:05.813 --> 03:10.780
Yes, at the College Huguenot Francais in Berlin.

03:11.161 --> 03:18.771
So he was bilingual, he was trilingual, because it was German and then French in Brussels.

03:18.987 --> 03:21.350
And then English, he learned afterwards.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.292
But I mean, he was very fluent.

03:23.332 --> 03:26.215
Was it his intention from the beginning to be a bookseller?

03:26.235 --> 03:27.897
No, he wanted to be a publisher.

03:28.317 --> 03:32.822
And he started in Berlin with one of the big publishing firms.

03:33.062 --> 03:34.844
No, auction firms.

03:34.864 --> 03:35.224
Auctions.

03:35.545 --> 03:37.086
But he wanted to become a publisher.

03:37.106 --> 03:39.309
But he started in an auction.

03:39.749 --> 03:42.592
And he said that was really an introduction to everything.

03:43.013 --> 03:47.037
Because the amount of material that came in,

03:47.422 --> 04:00.635
And some of these customers were so strange, and he often used to imitate them, because he enjoyed doing that kind of, well, you know, a little bit on it.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.218
Not too much, but it was always very amusing.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.743
Now, did he do any bookselling at all in Europe before he came to the United States?

04:07.763 --> 04:13.108
No, he worked for Pierre Barret at the beginning.

04:13.325 --> 04:24.641
And then Pierre Beres, that was in 1937, told him, well, he asked Pierre Beres, I feel like I have to leave Europe.

04:25.141 --> 04:32.131
So he went the other way and arrived in San Francisco.

04:32.271 --> 04:36.717
And it took something like, I think, many months.

04:36.737 --> 04:40.162
And he arrived, I think, with something like maybe five or six books.

04:40.783 --> 04:43.146
So finally he got to New York and he started.

04:43.430 --> 04:49.858
And it was in connection with Pierre Beres, and he sent him the book.

04:50.419 --> 05:04.678
And in 1953, he really decided to go on his own, because he was developing things that it went, and he wasn't always wanting to be the, shall we say,

05:04.979 --> 05:08.342
Do you know Pierre Berets?

05:08.523 --> 05:11.065
No, but I hope to interview him.

05:11.085 --> 05:12.827
I just go back from London on Sunday.

05:12.847 --> 05:13.187
Oh, I see.

05:13.288 --> 05:17.672
He was interviewed last year by the young Le Monde.

05:19.114 --> 05:20.655
Oh, really?

05:21.596 --> 05:33.028
And I cut out that because it's by accident that during the summer, you see, I go to, we have a little summer house in the Ruerg.

05:33.548 --> 05:37.754
And I always buy the paper there because I'm so keen as I'm bilingual.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.077
You see, my father was professor at Oxford.

05:40.838 --> 05:43.922
Romance languages, and we always spoke both languages.

05:44.162 --> 05:44.883
At home?

05:44.903 --> 05:45.384
At home, yes.

05:45.404 --> 05:46.185
Really?

05:46.205 --> 05:48.428
Oh, yes, I mean, I'm fluent in French.

05:48.448 --> 05:48.788
Oh, wow.

05:49.089 --> 05:50.771
I was going to make sure we're doing fine.

05:50.871 --> 05:50.971
Huh?

05:50.991 --> 05:52.133
I'm just checking out, sorry.

05:52.433 --> 05:55.117
Is it okay?

05:55.137 --> 05:56.178
Yeah, it's fine.

05:56.299 --> 06:01.125
So, I think that's also how Lucien and I, I'm...

06:01.358 --> 06:03.681
librarian by profession.

06:03.761 --> 06:05.123
I studied in Geneva.

06:05.143 --> 06:06.484
I got my diploma there.

06:06.584 --> 06:10.629
Then I went back to England because I'm actually in English form.

06:11.671 --> 06:15.015
And then during the war I worked at BBC in London.

06:15.115 --> 06:18.419
I was in charge of the Bushhack Library.

06:19.180 --> 06:19.941
How do you spell that?

06:20.241 --> 06:21.603
Bush, B-U-S-H.

06:22.924 --> 06:30.994
It was the library for anybody who wanted sort of foreign books, you know, to be

06:31.396 --> 06:41.370
It was the, well, Bush House was at the top of Portland Street there, you know, and that's fiction.

06:41.390 --> 06:48.059
But during the war, you see, after 1946, then I came to this country, but I'm not going to talk about myself.

06:48.099 --> 06:51.504
That's why I'm interested, though, because I'm interested in how you met with him.

06:51.524 --> 06:53.627
Well, I met him also during the war.

06:54.268 --> 06:54.949
In Europe?

06:55.069 --> 06:58.414
Yes, in London through a friend.

06:58.674 --> 07:01.318
Actually, he was his...

07:01.484 --> 07:30.293
schoolmate who had married a friend of mine from Bristol was a very good friend of mine and they were they had just got married and she told me why don't you come over for the day to London so I came over and I don't know what happened but they must have been just the right kind of attraction and for two years we corresponded because he asked me to send him a

07:30.577 --> 07:39.870
if there was a French newspaper published during the war in England, and there was.

07:40.571 --> 07:42.333
So that's how we started.

07:42.353 --> 07:45.117
And you worked as a librarian here too?

07:45.197 --> 07:49.243
No, I worked for Lucille because I married him in 46.

07:49.426 --> 07:50.427
I see.

07:50.487 --> 07:52.829
So he told me another thing, now you work for me.

07:52.849 --> 07:54.191
So he made you part of the business.

07:54.211 --> 07:56.673
Yeah, but I played check and fiddle all my life.

07:58.014 --> 08:03.220
But I did all the descriptions and I did some of the research and what was necessary.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.224
So you became a bibliographer as well then, didn't you?

08:07.824 --> 08:07.964
Yeah.

08:07.984 --> 08:10.727
What did Lucien study in university?

08:10.747 --> 08:13.670
Well, he actually did not.

08:14.371 --> 08:17.313
He never went to the university.

08:17.414 --> 08:17.834
He didn't?

08:17.854 --> 08:17.914
No.

08:18.080 --> 08:28.290
What is amazing is that Basho in Berlin was equivalent to one the first year at the university.

08:28.490 --> 08:29.371
I see.

08:29.391 --> 08:33.575
But all his life, he had Latin and Greek at school.

08:33.595 --> 08:35.116
It was a marvelous school.

08:35.236 --> 08:37.098
I mean, what he learned.

08:37.659 --> 08:46.467
And it opened up to everything because he was not only interested in art, literature, music, but also a bit of science.

08:47.088 --> 08:48.590
He's a man who's like this.

08:50.152 --> 08:56.381
And that is remarkable because you could talk to him about any subject.

08:57.723 --> 08:58.844
Especially architecture.

08:59.305 --> 09:10.320
He got very... And his son, I mean, I have a son and a daughter, and he is now... Well, he's been now for quite a few years.

09:10.560 --> 09:14.005
He's now in New York.

09:14.025 --> 09:15.627
He's in Tribeca.

09:15.927 --> 09:20.733
And he has a firm called FTL, and they do lightweight structures.

09:22.175 --> 09:29.966
And he's the one that did four projects for the Olympic Games, you know, in Atlanta.

09:30.526 --> 09:39.138
And he did for the, every year, you know, there's that big tent that is put out in Central Park.

09:39.158 --> 09:41.721
Well, that is my son that created it.

09:41.921 --> 09:43.183
And he's done many other things.

09:43.400 --> 09:57.623
But you see, with the two, they got along very well, the son and the father, because the son opened up his views on spaces, and we took our children to Europe.

09:57.643 --> 10:00.127
We didn't put them in camps.

10:00.147 --> 10:04.874
We took them to Greece, we took them to Portugal, we took them to Italy.

10:05.455 --> 10:09.762
You see, I think that's the best education that we've given them.

10:10.298 --> 10:18.968
And they have both, my daughter who's a jeweler, this is what she does, and they both said this was the best education.

10:19.689 --> 10:35.988
I've never heard them say, well, of course, they criticize their parents naturally, they're old-fashioned and so on, but it has been a wonderful kind of feeling, and Lucien, I think, benefited very much from this.

10:36.008 --> 10:36.709
What's the son?

10:36.749 --> 10:38.010
What are the children's names?

10:38.328 --> 10:40.230
Nicholas, thank you.

10:40.671 --> 10:41.953
C-H-O-L-A-S.

10:42.193 --> 10:44.296
And the other one is Juliet.

10:44.676 --> 10:46.919
J-U-L-I-E-T.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.521
But my son is Goldsmith.

10:49.042 --> 10:50.964
He's not Goldsmith.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.809
So he is Nicholas Gold... Smith.

10:55.410 --> 10:55.810
Smith.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.693
Yes.

10:59.515 --> 11:04.882
So when your husband first went to work for Beres, what kind of things did he do?

11:04.902 --> 11:08.166
Well, I mean, Beres had this shop

11:08.821 --> 11:38.541
in Paris, and he had French literature, mainly what you call les belles, and then he went to dealers and enter private people, who was very good at getting sort of not only manuscript, but autographed letters, or libraries from people who had been sort of, I mean,

11:38.791 --> 11:41.314
writers, anybody like that.

11:41.955 --> 11:47.902
So Lucier had benefits in a way, but he was very difficult to have.

11:48.063 --> 11:49.925
He was very self-centered.

11:49.945 --> 11:50.906
They were the same age.

11:51.567 --> 11:51.827
Really?

11:51.847 --> 11:52.728
He's still alive.

11:53.069 --> 11:53.609
Yes.

11:53.629 --> 11:59.897
And he, if you read that article by, I could give you a copy of Rutherford Black.

11:59.917 --> 12:00.518
I would love that.

12:00.558 --> 12:02.841
I would love that.

12:02.861 --> 12:03.702
That would be wonderful.

12:03.935 --> 12:06.959
I was going to be asking you if that would be okay.

12:07.260 --> 12:07.840
No, no.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.563
I'll do that.

12:09.643 --> 12:12.647
You can see that man is so vain.

12:12.667 --> 12:22.441
Because you see, when the person I was interviewing him said, well, tell me a little bit about your biography.

12:23.062 --> 12:25.866
And he sort of said, oh, my biography is too rich.

12:25.906 --> 12:27.308
I have no memory.

12:27.989 --> 12:32.315
He has no less, I've known him for 50 years now.

12:32.896 --> 12:33.857
He has no less

12:34.529 --> 12:42.878
His first wife is Huguette Beret, who has a gallery at the Quai Voltaire.

12:42.898 --> 12:49.044
And she has a gallery of art, and a very wonderful gallery.

12:49.064 --> 12:54.029
And her daughter is with her, so it's Huguette Anne Isabelle Beret.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.512
This is her daughter with Beret?

12:56.652 --> 12:57.673
With Ger, yeah.

12:58.133 --> 13:01.617
He had three children with the first one.

13:02.086 --> 13:17.600
And one is a doctor, a medical doctor, who belonged to the, wait a minute, called them, Les Médecins Sans Frontières.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.102
And he went to all sorts of places.

13:20.562 --> 13:24.266
He also, like his father, can't stick to the same one.

13:24.286 --> 13:31.232
So Pierre Beres-Arthoud married eye specialist.

13:32.107 --> 13:33.029
for two years.

13:33.069 --> 13:36.635
And then after that, he married a charming girl.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.358
We liked her so much.

13:38.378 --> 13:39.780
And they had five children.

13:39.820 --> 13:44.529
And he divorced her to get married to a younger girl.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.415
And I understand he has a little baby of, say, two years.

13:49.337 --> 13:50.259
I'm disgusted.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.482
He's an elderly man.

13:52.502 --> 13:53.444
He's got a little baby.

13:53.464 --> 13:53.745
Yeah.

13:54.205 --> 13:55.127
He's my age.

13:56.542 --> 13:57.844
When I'm 84, he's 83.

13:57.864 --> 13:59.826
And he has a child?

14:00.047 --> 14:07.317
Well, look, Charlie Chaplin, Picasso, they've gone on having children all their lives.

14:07.437 --> 14:09.920
But it's not fair for the kids, either.

14:09.940 --> 14:19.193
I agree with you, because there is something... It's not right when there is such a difference of age between... Because a father at that age can't be a real father.

14:19.433 --> 14:22.217
No, besides, he never looked after his children.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.899
So he had eight children...

14:24.554 --> 14:27.577
and this one makes nine, and the ones in between.

14:27.637 --> 14:29.278
Don't ask me.

14:31.020 --> 14:35.865
Well, they must be quite... So, was he helpful to Lucien, though, in some ways?

14:35.885 --> 14:40.349
Well, for Lucien, because, you see, after all, he started with nothing.

14:41.110 --> 14:42.951
So he did help him at the beginning.

14:44.172 --> 14:52.300
But then he was always sending us books that we found very difficult to sell, because Pierre Vérez did not want to

14:52.634 --> 15:19.772
uh bother with these well you know when you buy a whole library there's some books you don't quite know what to do so he thought well let's send them to new york he can do what he likes so after a little while you can and the letters the two of them wrote together i mean i can tell you i have still some letters there oh it was very difficult no you're not an easy man well was the name of the company here uh

15:20.225 --> 15:20.986
Pierre Beret.

15:21.006 --> 15:23.389
Oh, so it was under Beret's name here then.

15:23.409 --> 15:25.411
Yeah, Pierre Beret's at the beginning.

15:25.852 --> 15:29.696
And after 1953, it was called Lucien Goldschmidt Think.

15:30.637 --> 15:33.160
And so did he sever his ties with Beret at that point?

15:33.180 --> 15:37.325
Yes, well, yes, but we, I mean, we didn't quarrel, I mean.

15:37.345 --> 15:40.088
No, but I mean, basically it was time to begin.

15:40.108 --> 15:44.613
Yeah, I mean, he said that that was enough and he divided whatever there was.

15:44.673 --> 15:47.937
Tell me, now Lucien left

15:48.558 --> 15:52.404
Well, at the counter of the Nazis.

15:52.804 --> 15:54.106
And then he was in the army.

15:55.689 --> 16:01.597
You see, he volunteered to be in the American army.

16:01.938 --> 16:02.559
And he went.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.807
He had an extremely interesting time because he was in the intelligence.

16:08.327 --> 16:16.860
And that is where he met some interesting people who were professors or assistants

16:17.228 --> 16:26.477
He met I don't know how many people that were all Americans and also with plenty of knowledge.

16:27.198 --> 16:28.900
And we've been friends with several.

16:31.262 --> 16:34.345
Did he ever talk at all about his experiences with Europe?

16:34.365 --> 16:41.272
I mean, was he fearful that he would be... Did he have a sense that he would probably be killed by the Nazis if he stayed there?

16:42.554 --> 16:45.717
No, but he didn't like the way it was going.

16:46.692 --> 16:53.703
And he saw quite well that things would have gone and he probably would have also disappeared.

16:53.863 --> 16:57.288
I mean, he had his eyes wide open.

16:59.151 --> 17:06.281
And have you read Barney Rosenthal's lecture on the Jewish emigre booksellers?

17:06.942 --> 17:10.167
Are you familiar with the lecture?

17:10.368 --> 17:13.532
Yes, the one who gave it, not the Morgan, they gave it at Columbia.

17:13.552 --> 17:14.033
No, the Morgan.

17:14.384 --> 17:15.866
Yes, absolutely.

17:15.886 --> 17:17.789
The Malkin Lecture, yeah.

17:17.809 --> 17:38.200
The thrust of that essay, of that lecture, and it's just something I'm trying to develop in this book, is he contends that, and Roger started at Harvard is the one who pointed this out to me, that this small group of booksellers really did change the flow in the history of bookselling for a period of 40 or 50 years.

17:38.221 --> 17:39.382
Would you agree with that?

17:39.402 --> 17:40.003
Absolutely.

17:40.484 --> 17:42.467
Because they had knowledge.

17:43.392 --> 17:45.615
And they were willing to work very hard.

17:45.956 --> 17:52.485
There was Offenbaché, Offenbach, who made beautiful catalogues.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.628
They were willing to work at it.

17:54.728 --> 17:57.732
And finally, they had such knowledge.

17:59.114 --> 17:59.655
You see?

18:00.315 --> 18:06.865
I mean, compared to the booksellers here, they have one little section, but they have nothing further.

18:07.205 --> 18:12.252
We had books right from the Renaissance,

18:12.907 --> 18:17.574
Oh, I mean, right to time of Picasso.

18:19.116 --> 18:20.438
And it's amazing.

18:21.460 --> 18:25.346
And also some German books and some Italian and Spanish and all that.

18:25.746 --> 18:31.655
So this is really maybe less on... We have nothing on American, nothing in English.

18:32.717 --> 18:33.177
Really?

18:33.198 --> 18:35.241
No, because you have to specialize.

18:35.261 --> 18:41.530
And as we started with Pierre Beres, naturally we became specializing on this.

18:42.134 --> 18:49.386
But all the illustrated books by Matisse, Dulcey, Picasso, we had all these books.

18:49.787 --> 18:55.737
What they call Les... What was it?

18:55.757 --> 18:57.139
Les D'artistes.

18:57.159 --> 18:57.760
Les D'artistes, yeah.

18:57.780 --> 18:58.842
Yeah, I know.

18:59.082 --> 19:01.667
By the way, I've got a few of these.

19:02.408 --> 19:06.775
This is the one we made, which is really quite good, on Villon.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.005
If you want to have this, I'll give it to you yourself.

19:10.125 --> 19:16.134
This is another one, which is... And this is the one we're very proud of.

19:16.154 --> 19:16.936
Oh, this is wonderful.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.117
Are you going to let me borrow these?

19:18.178 --> 19:19.239
No, no, you can have them.

19:19.319 --> 19:19.880
I'll give them to you.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.441
Oh, you're wonderful.

19:20.641 --> 19:23.426
This is the one that Lisien was very proud of.

19:23.446 --> 19:26.992
It took 12 years to accumulate these books.

19:27.012 --> 19:30.016
You see, he had a sense of being good.

19:30.177 --> 19:32.280
A good citizen was really in him.

19:33.061 --> 19:34.163
What is strange...

19:34.430 --> 19:37.114
He has so many traits, like my father had.

19:37.495 --> 19:38.737
It's very strange.

19:38.757 --> 19:41.561
And this, it took him 12 years to accumulate.

19:41.902 --> 19:44.065
And he did all the notes here.

19:44.206 --> 19:46.109
So you can see how thorough this is.

19:46.129 --> 19:50.255
Now tell me, explain to me from my tape recorder what a good citizen is.

19:50.275 --> 19:58.969
Well, books that would actually improve the mankind.

19:59.675 --> 20:08.468
And furthermore, the introduction is by Nicholas Parker, whom you'll probably know, who's a brilliant speaker.

20:08.488 --> 20:11.732
Oh, he's a marvelous man, and he's got knowledge.

20:11.792 --> 20:17.601
He also wrote a very nice, when my husband died, in one of the English newspapers.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.064
I'll have to check it out.

20:21.567 --> 20:22.388
I may have that.

20:22.408 --> 20:23.630
I can also send you it.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.053
Let me do my card, too, before we...

20:26.287 --> 20:26.687
Okay.

20:27.028 --> 20:29.651
I think you gave me on the telephone your... I did.

20:29.711 --> 20:31.053
But still.

20:31.073 --> 20:33.215
I'll give you a card anyway.

20:33.436 --> 20:37.440
So was he pleased to be an American?

20:37.480 --> 20:38.962
Oh, he enjoyed it.

20:40.464 --> 20:42.066
He has never regretted it.

20:43.307 --> 20:48.834
And he hasn't felt, well, maybe the fact that I'm not Jewish.

20:49.935 --> 20:53.680
I mean, I'm the only one in the family who's not Jewish.

20:53.740 --> 20:54.741
And would you believe it?

20:55.345 --> 21:10.120
I hold the family together, because we have some relatives in Israel, and when they come, they feel more termed with me, though, I mean, we don't talk so much about religion, but I don't know what it is.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.922
It's maybe also my Swiss background.

21:13.403 --> 21:15.545
I have some Swiss blood, you see.

21:15.565 --> 21:19.909
So, I mean, that was before the gold business.

21:20.150 --> 21:22.652
So what was your maiden name?

21:23.037 --> 21:24.719
How do you spell?

21:24.919 --> 21:26.842
S-T-U-D-E-R.

21:26.862 --> 21:29.044
Okay.

21:29.064 --> 21:30.987
So anyway, you were talking about the good citizens.

21:31.007 --> 21:31.387
Yeah.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.570
This is amazing.

21:33.670 --> 21:38.836
And he was very disappointed because this did not sell properly.

21:38.856 --> 21:39.597
Only a little bit.

21:39.657 --> 21:45.684
And he was hoping that one library or one collector would like to buy the whole thing.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.847
So that disappointed him.

21:48.147 --> 21:49.449
So what happened to the collection?

21:49.469 --> 21:53.053
It was sold... Well, in this, but I mean, we had things left over.

21:53.073 --> 21:54.955
So this is a collection he put together himself.

21:55.015 --> 21:56.196
Yeah.

21:56.216 --> 21:57.818
Did he consider himself a collector?

21:58.719 --> 22:03.365
Oh, he also, because look, he collected, and look at what we have on the walls.

22:03.385 --> 22:04.286
I mean, look.

22:05.547 --> 22:10.793
But when he was putting this together, do you think he was collecting for himself, in a way?

22:11.474 --> 22:12.435
No.

22:12.455 --> 22:14.037
I think he wanted to do it.

22:14.472 --> 22:18.717
Well, because unless you're very rich, you can't really keep all these things.

22:18.737 --> 22:19.458
You have to buy.

22:19.478 --> 22:28.328
But you see, to be quite frank, when you buy a collection, there's always one or two things that you can feel, oh, well, I can keep that for myself.

22:28.528 --> 22:31.932
I mean, without being, if I should say that.

22:32.793 --> 22:34.234
Oh, that's funny.

22:34.295 --> 22:35.075
So when was this?

22:35.135 --> 22:36.117
When did this happen?

22:36.277 --> 22:37.458
I'll check it out.

22:37.478 --> 22:39.881
Doesn't it say their date?

22:39.901 --> 22:40.441
It does, yes.

22:40.462 --> 22:40.782
It should.

22:40.802 --> 22:40.902
Yeah.

22:42.350 --> 22:45.373
Well, we closed the shop... 1981, it is.

22:45.473 --> 22:45.713
Yeah.

22:46.134 --> 22:53.001
This is the last catalogue we produced, and that was exactly ten years ago, when we closed the shop.

22:53.021 --> 22:56.144
So, was he sad to close the shop, or was...?

22:56.164 --> 23:04.473
No, he was 75, and I was 74, and he decided, told everybody, I don't want to go come out on a stretcher.

23:05.614 --> 23:06.735
And I think he was right.

23:06.916 --> 23:11.260
So he had five years of being retired,

23:11.358 --> 23:21.410
And he went on seeing dealers and go on writing a bit of this and that and giving lectures.

23:21.430 --> 23:23.713
He gave quite a few lectures, you know.

23:24.053 --> 23:35.187
And he was also, this is what he got these letters, the Toulouse-Rotrack letters that Mr. Chemault.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.590
Mr. Chemault bought from us.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.492
But that is quite a feat.

23:39.961 --> 23:54.462
because my husband found letters that had been hidden in a little kind of sort of reticule, you call it in French, kind of little bag.

23:55.303 --> 23:58.348
And some of them, the people didn't know.

23:58.668 --> 24:06.339
It's actually the only thing that you would have on the life of Toulouse-Rautrec, because he never wrote anything.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.162
And these are the letters

24:08.513 --> 24:12.537
written to his mother, and to all sorts of people.

24:12.557 --> 24:14.539
Well, and where did your husband find these?

24:15.059 --> 24:17.261
Ah, he was very clever there.

24:17.281 --> 24:29.893
You see, every time he went to Europe for about three weeks, and he used to make the round, he is very acquainted with André Jamme.

24:29.913 --> 24:30.594
How do you feel?

24:30.614 --> 24:33.357
Jamme, J-A-M-M-E-S.

24:33.377 --> 24:33.477
Okay.

24:33.877 --> 24:36.900
He's from Paris, and it's a

24:37.960 --> 24:41.926
third generation, I think, of booksellers, or at least a second.

24:43.268 --> 24:45.252
And they were very, very friendly.

24:45.772 --> 24:47.615
And he was wonderful, that man.

24:47.635 --> 24:48.517
He still exists.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.941
He's much younger than we are.

24:50.961 --> 24:52.523
So where are these letters now?

24:53.465 --> 24:59.214
Oh, they were sold to Schimmel, Mr. Schimmel.

24:59.374 --> 24:59.875
Oh, I see.

24:59.955 --> 25:04.963
Who I don't know what happened, whether he still has them or whether

25:05.163 --> 25:14.793
It was because he sold his whole collection to a Japanese sort of, I don't know what you would call him, a collector of some kind.

25:15.654 --> 25:16.154
I don't know.

25:16.174 --> 25:17.736
You think they went to Japan, possibly?

25:17.836 --> 25:18.937
Yeah, I think so.

25:18.957 --> 25:21.580
But were these letters located by your husband?

25:21.700 --> 25:23.081
Yes, he found them all.

25:23.401 --> 25:28.987
And then... Little by little, and there were some also that came at auction.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.930
So, of course,

25:32.146 --> 25:36.111
called up Herb Schimmel because they were very friendly.

25:36.171 --> 25:40.417
They saw each other at least every week, every two weeks, you know, and so on.

25:40.537 --> 25:42.520
And where is Schimmel located?

25:42.540 --> 25:43.381
Well, he is.

25:43.401 --> 25:48.027
I can give you... He's an American collector, sure.

25:48.048 --> 25:48.368
Oh, yes.

25:48.408 --> 25:49.610
He's a well-known man.

25:50.170 --> 26:01.005
But now his collection, I think, has changed a bit because I think he had also furniture of the... Well, if you tell me how to get in touch with him, I'll ask him what happened to the... Yeah.

26:02.234 --> 26:02.915
Yeah.

26:02.935 --> 26:12.865
Since 1955, together with Lucien Goldsmith, he has undertaken the enormous task of tracing and collecting surviving Toulouse-La Tricorda.

26:13.025 --> 26:15.707
In fact, it was your husband that traced these, right?

26:15.727 --> 26:16.488
Yeah, yeah.

26:16.829 --> 26:17.890
Well, I'd love to talk to him.

26:17.950 --> 26:21.433
He could probably give me some pretty interesting information about that.

26:21.453 --> 26:22.014
Oh, yes, he would.

26:22.034 --> 26:22.134
Yeah.

26:22.154 --> 26:23.095
I think he's in town.

26:23.135 --> 26:25.057
He has also a place in Florida.

26:25.477 --> 26:25.657
He does?

26:25.697 --> 26:27.319
West, what do you call it?

26:27.339 --> 26:27.439
Okay.

26:27.539 --> 26:28.760
West Palm Beach or wherever?

26:28.780 --> 26:29.801
No, no, not where.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.363
Lower down, where they...

26:31.647 --> 26:36.191
It's rather the old... What is it called?

26:36.212 --> 26:40.776
I don't have that, but I have the... If you want, I can give you his address.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.037
Yes, I'd happily write him.

26:42.057 --> 26:44.660
We'll call him.

26:47.222 --> 26:53.168
We have an office, 150 Central Park South.

26:54.390 --> 26:56.872
Or maybe that 75 is the office.

26:56.892 --> 26:58.954
The other one would be 223...

26:59.440 --> 26:59.781
7366.

26:59.801 --> 26:59.941
223.

26:59.961 --> 27:02.645
7366.

27:02.745 --> 27:05.390
That would be the home of the office.

27:05.410 --> 27:05.850
The home.

27:06.031 --> 27:08.655
And I think the office would be 7656114.

27:09.296 --> 27:12.060
Well, I'll try the office.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.504
Yeah, and it's 32406.

27:14.905 --> 27:19.152
He has a son, so maybe the son can tell you.

27:19.172 --> 27:19.372
Okay.

27:19.713 --> 27:25.181
I love to, when I'm writing about books, I always talk to some of the people who work with them, you know.

27:25.242 --> 27:25.522
Yeah.

27:25.542 --> 27:26.644
They can give a nice comment.

27:26.664 --> 27:26.764
Yeah.

27:27.031 --> 27:33.599
No, no, he would because, I mean, we did so much for him and also we saw them.

27:33.940 --> 27:35.302
But you know, it's very funny.

27:35.642 --> 27:39.106
All these people since I'm a widow, completely out.

27:42.571 --> 27:44.453
I mean, I would never have thought.

27:45.254 --> 27:49.420
That's why I do more for women who are getting widows.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.422
I mean, I have several of my friends.

27:51.442 --> 27:53.545
But I've never seen anything like that.

27:53.778 --> 28:02.047
And the Grohny Club is the only place where immediately I used to be very friendly with Martin Antonetti.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.208
Do you know him?

28:03.228 --> 28:04.049
Yes.

28:04.069 --> 28:05.090
He's actually charming.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.651
Yes, he just went to Smith College.

28:06.712 --> 28:09.114
Yes, I know, but he was a very good friend of mine.

28:09.234 --> 28:13.539
And he told me right from the beginning, there won't be any difference.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.441
I will send you all the announcements.

28:15.821 --> 28:16.502
Isn't that nice?

28:16.522 --> 28:21.507
And then after three years, I decided, everybody said, why don't you become a member?

28:21.959 --> 28:24.883
Because I work there one afternoon a week.

28:25.624 --> 28:29.549
I said, they've been so good, I'm going to do something for this club.

28:29.569 --> 28:35.136
And they rather like it because they don't have anybody who's professional to file the cards and all that.

28:35.156 --> 28:36.097
It's a good filing for them.

28:36.438 --> 28:38.300
I've done a lot of filing and things like that.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.722
That's great, because you're a professional.

28:40.142 --> 28:41.865
They don't have to explain to me.

28:41.885 --> 28:43.947
They say, can you get me this?

28:43.967 --> 28:47.252
I'm in this catalog or so on, and I usually find it.

28:47.372 --> 28:48.073
Oh, that's great.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.616
I was just delighted to grow your last year myself.

28:50.967 --> 28:55.491
Well, I was also last year, but... Yeah, I went to the... Did you go to the dinner this year?

28:55.511 --> 28:56.312
Yes.

28:56.332 --> 28:57.013
Yes, I was there.

28:57.033 --> 28:57.613
Yeah.

28:57.633 --> 28:58.174
It was very nice.

28:58.494 --> 28:59.655
No, no, it's very nice.

28:59.776 --> 29:09.605
And they were extremely decent to me, so I said, well, now that I come in through the main door, it makes a little difference.

29:09.625 --> 29:12.748
But they've been very, very good, and it's the only institution.

29:13.309 --> 29:17.152
Lucien was a life member at the Metropolitan.

29:17.353 --> 29:20.856
We also, MoMA and all these places.

29:22.456 --> 29:22.876
No, no.

29:22.896 --> 29:25.039
Hard to figure out, isn't it?

29:25.059 --> 29:33.107
I think I understood because a lawyer who used to come to our shop told me, well, it's very simple.

29:33.428 --> 29:34.449
You were two people.

29:34.509 --> 29:35.270
You were a couple.

29:35.870 --> 29:36.951
And now you're only one.

29:36.991 --> 29:49.144
And then somebody else told me, you know, that women are so afraid when there is a single woman that she's going to take the husband away.

29:49.825 --> 29:49.965
Mm-hmm.

29:50.536 --> 29:54.861
I mean, that's a very narrow way, but I know that things have happened this way.

29:56.603 --> 30:04.632
But you see, if I was a widow, widower, this wouldn't have happened, because they've always want more men at dinner table.

30:04.652 --> 30:20.070
So in order to combat this, I invite people, because I'm very fond of cooking, and this is where I have my little revenge, and from time to time I have about eight people for supper, and I cook.

30:20.422 --> 30:22.425
a lot of decent people.

30:23.086 --> 30:32.238
Now this is the way I can get some of these people back because nobody in New York has very good time.

30:32.858 --> 30:44.254
They're always so busy or they invite you for these kind of cocktails where you eat this impossible food and the next day you're sick because half of it stayed too long in the icebox.

30:44.374 --> 30:47.678
Or it was catered by somebody, you know.

30:48.181 --> 30:51.305
Did your husband go to Europe after the war?

30:51.325 --> 30:53.528
Did he acquire material?

30:53.548 --> 30:54.629
He went every year.

30:55.690 --> 30:58.614
To bring staff, yeah.

30:58.694 --> 31:00.236
Of course, he knew where to go, right?

31:00.256 --> 31:07.144
He knew where to go, and also he made friends all the time, because the people noticed he knew so much.

31:07.164 --> 31:12.010
And he had a way of going through and talk at the same time.

31:12.050 --> 31:13.632
It was rather interesting to notice.

31:14.118 --> 31:17.844
He was talking, and yet he could see there was an interesting book of it.

31:18.305 --> 31:20.508
Alors, dites-moi, vous n'avez rien d'autre?

31:20.889 --> 31:22.631
Ou vous avez sûrement quelque chose?

31:22.651 --> 31:24.334
You know, I can remember all this.

31:24.715 --> 31:26.437
It was really, very nice.

31:26.858 --> 31:31.225
Did he do much work with institutions, or was it mostly private?

31:31.285 --> 31:36.053
No, no, quite a bit, and he went to institutions.

31:36.073 --> 31:38.356
And what, like, you mentioned Philip Holford.

31:38.376 --> 31:39.859
Did he get stuff for Harvard?

31:39.919 --> 31:41.982
Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.

31:42.113 --> 31:55.686
And for Yale, I mean... Yes, I mean, before we had, because he made so many catalogues, he did something like 63 catalogues, I think.

31:55.766 --> 32:06.596
So do you think that the collections in this country are so much stronger because of people like your husband and some of the others who went in and... I think it made the base of several.

32:08.178 --> 32:10.720
Because you see also he was able

32:11.105 --> 32:16.072
to sort of describe why they should have it.

32:16.993 --> 32:18.275
Because he had the knowledge.

32:20.178 --> 32:23.983
Most booksellers here, the knowledge is rather slim.

32:25.305 --> 32:32.215
I don't care if they've been at the university, but it's what you do afterwards with what you have.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.198
Explain what you mean to me.

32:34.358 --> 32:36.621
Can you give me an example?

32:36.641 --> 32:39.525
When you say the knowledge,

32:40.012 --> 32:42.835
Because if you see a book, it's just a book.

32:42.855 --> 32:46.558
It takes somebody to understand the context of the book, the importance.

32:46.579 --> 32:51.083
Yeah, and also the, for instance, the binding.

32:52.524 --> 32:53.886
Who bound the thing?

32:54.546 --> 32:55.587
When it was done?

32:56.208 --> 32:58.831
Was it influenced by this or that?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.113
And where did it come from?

33:01.693 --> 33:03.395
From which library before?

33:04.316 --> 33:06.418
I mean, all of that is very subtle.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.280
But you have to be...

33:08.935 --> 33:10.317
very interested in it.

33:11.739 --> 33:16.046
And then he would make these representations to the institutions?

33:16.066 --> 33:21.314
Yeah, he would call them up, or then sometimes he was invited to go over.

33:21.554 --> 33:25.681
For instance, Rosenwald, you know?

33:25.821 --> 33:26.141
Lessing.

33:26.342 --> 33:27.564
Lessing, yeah.

33:27.584 --> 33:28.946
He went regularly.

33:29.486 --> 33:37.018
And he knew how to behave with people, because he had a great deal of diplomatic

33:37.724 --> 33:39.065
Behaviour, shall we say.

33:40.447 --> 33:44.291
And also you went to Dumbarton Oaks, Mrs. Bliss.

33:44.311 --> 33:47.954
You know, the Mrs. What is the first name?

33:48.134 --> 33:48.395
Wood?

33:49.115 --> 33:51.398
No.

33:51.498 --> 33:52.619
Mrs. Bliss, yeah.

33:52.639 --> 33:53.640
That's in Washington.

33:53.660 --> 33:58.184
That's in Washington, the Dumbarton Oaks.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.567
She was tempted with something.

34:01.207 --> 34:04.751
And then she said, Mr. Goldschmidt.

34:04.771 --> 34:06.853
You see, let me take these people afterwards.

34:07.222 --> 34:10.486
Why don't you sell something else?

34:11.847 --> 34:13.810
So he knew exactly what it was.

34:13.890 --> 34:20.998
And there was also Mrs. Hunt, you know, the one who, she had four children, Marietje.

34:22.440 --> 34:30.489
The one with all the flowers, you know, she did this bibliography of flowers.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.532
You know whom I mean?

34:33.933 --> 34:35.355
That's Paul Miller's one.

34:35.791 --> 34:37.633
No, no, no, I know.

34:37.653 --> 34:39.595
No, no, it isn't.

34:39.615 --> 34:40.716
Oh, my gosh.

34:40.736 --> 34:41.978
What is it, Carnegie?

34:43.499 --> 34:45.461
Carnegie or something.

34:45.882 --> 34:46.983
I forget many things.

34:47.524 --> 34:54.431
But she actually, at one time, we had the roses of Roduté.

34:54.471 --> 35:04.802
But the original, original watercolor that Roduté did with, now, which is, is it?

35:05.491 --> 35:07.494
or the scene, or I don't know which one.

35:07.534 --> 35:12.400
You see, I don't want to give you notes, you have to check this.

35:12.601 --> 35:14.804
I always check everything out.

35:14.824 --> 35:15.665
Don't worry about that.

35:15.705 --> 35:19.430
No, because I wouldn't like to be told afterwards.

35:19.490 --> 35:20.812
I never go just by quotes.

35:20.892 --> 35:22.214
Yeah, okay.

35:22.494 --> 35:26.539
That's why I take notes too, for things to check out.

35:26.559 --> 35:29.203
No, she actually...

35:30.787 --> 35:37.272
You see, Rodite gave a watercolor lesson to some of these aristocratic people.

35:37.513 --> 35:40.715
And he is the most famous man on roses.

35:41.596 --> 35:46.941
And there was an album of his original, we got that through Berest.

35:48.122 --> 35:50.504
And they were extremely expensive.

35:51.485 --> 35:55.208
And he did the roses and he did also the lilies.

35:55.768 --> 36:00.372
And the lilies were, a couple of years ago, sold at

36:01.094 --> 36:03.216
Sotheby.

36:03.236 --> 36:16.190
And I think they had been in the collection of this bookseller who was really, oh my gosh, his daughter is still alive.

36:16.210 --> 36:17.832
Oh, what's the name now?

36:17.852 --> 36:19.334
Well, that's okay.

36:19.354 --> 36:20.955
Well, anyway, there was a two.

36:20.995 --> 36:30.966
But these roses, Lucien sold one white rose and one red rose in pairs.

36:31.621 --> 36:37.327
And then Mrs. Hunt bought two, and I think also Mrs. Bliss and other people.

36:37.927 --> 36:39.389
But these were very tops.

36:41.290 --> 36:52.121
How did he get so interested in the art and the engravings?

36:52.321 --> 36:59.248
Well, that came with, I don't know, I suppose with the... Also, you see, having old books.

36:59.768 --> 37:05.796
Because in it you have these illustrations.

37:05.816 --> 37:07.178
So you have to learn more.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.241
But he was amazing.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.384
He has a really very good eye.

37:13.247 --> 37:22.600
I mean, to see what it was or whether what century and so on and what it represented and so on.

37:23.020 --> 37:28.408
And we had a huge library of reference that I sold.

37:28.692 --> 37:31.778
Soon after he died, because he had to.

37:31.858 --> 37:32.900
He was in storage.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.844
We couldn't go on doing that.

37:34.884 --> 37:37.068
Somebody else was used to do another bookseller you for?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.050
Well, I mean, no, no.

37:38.110 --> 37:39.653
We sold it at Swan.

37:39.673 --> 37:40.174
Oh, really?

37:40.194 --> 37:42.198
So it was anybody who wanted.

37:42.478 --> 37:43.581
But it sold quite well.

37:44.122 --> 37:45.003
Better than the books.

37:45.023 --> 37:49.151
Now I'm making a list of all the prints that are left over.

37:49.171 --> 37:50.093
Oh, my God.

37:50.579 --> 37:53.804
You get into prints really as an adjunct to the books?

37:54.245 --> 37:57.289
Yeah, because he's disinterested in him.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.191
The art always is.

37:58.451 --> 38:00.915
Look at the furniture he bought.

38:00.935 --> 38:05.282
I mean, we have a huge table there, which is a nose one.

38:05.302 --> 38:08.447
I've got a cover on top, but that's a Spanish table.

38:08.807 --> 38:15.878
This one is from Austria, and we have some old furniture also in the hoard.

38:16.178 --> 38:40.752
renaissance and then he was interested in keys you see that's his keys but those two are mine that's my interest also no not the keys but i mean these kind of strange uh ornaments yeah yeah this uh this one comes from

38:41.407 --> 38:46.635
I have a few things like that, but I don't have to be like my husband, you see.

38:46.655 --> 38:48.637
I don't have to do something different.

38:49.158 --> 38:56.369
This reminded me so much of textile, because my daughter was in textile, and I've always been interested in textile.

38:56.389 --> 38:59.413
I've done knitting and sew and winnit and what.

39:00.074 --> 39:03.118
And this comes from, I think, Rihanna.

39:03.739 --> 39:07.144
But it has a wonderful touch, and this is what I like.

39:07.310 --> 39:10.473
Did your husband write at all about his experiences at the bookstore?

39:10.493 --> 39:11.875
No, he didn't want to.

39:11.915 --> 39:19.702
Because he said there would be too much... Several people approached and said, why don't you write a book?

39:19.722 --> 39:25.428
He said, no, I don't want to give all these bits of stories because I know what people want.

39:25.929 --> 39:31.134
They want something that is exciting, you know?

39:32.415 --> 39:33.376
Little stories.

39:33.416 --> 39:34.397
They don't want...

39:34.850 --> 39:38.880
something which is really... They don't want knowledge, they want anecdotes.

39:38.940 --> 39:39.642
Exactly.

39:39.662 --> 39:41.145
They want to be entertained.

39:41.486 --> 39:44.413
And you didn't want to write that.

39:44.453 --> 39:50.227
That's why I think that I don't know anybody who said any nasty word about him.

39:51.550 --> 39:52.673
Which is quite remarkable.

39:53.699 --> 39:56.422
So he was a totally discreet man, in other words.

39:56.442 --> 39:57.243
Very discreet.

39:57.523 --> 40:01.007
And he didn't like committees because he said, it's a waste of time.

40:01.248 --> 40:03.170
Everybody wants to say his little thing.

40:03.590 --> 40:05.753
You can do all that in five minutes.

40:06.994 --> 40:07.855
He was very quick.

40:08.556 --> 40:14.403
Did he take any particular pride and pleasure in helping people build wonderful collections?

40:14.423 --> 40:14.924
Yes, he did.

40:15.104 --> 40:15.664
He liked that.

40:16.045 --> 40:22.272
And if he could help anybody, for instance, somebody who was a student who said, well, you see,

40:22.792 --> 40:25.314
I would love this, but I really can't afford it.

40:25.735 --> 40:27.736
They would say, well, you don't have to tell me now.

40:27.776 --> 40:33.662
Put it aside and you can give me, say, five or ten dollars next month and so on.

40:34.062 --> 40:40.348
And several people have really come back and said, you know, you started me on it.

40:40.368 --> 40:41.249
Really?

40:41.729 --> 40:50.537
And for instance, the dealer Goodfriend, Jim Goodfriend, when he wanted to go into dealing, he came to Lucerne and asked him,

40:50.737 --> 40:51.758
What do you think about it?

40:51.778 --> 40:53.320
And he encouraged him.

40:53.340 --> 40:55.803
He said, yes, yes, you should.

40:55.823 --> 41:04.313
He never had any close calls, as you said, he mentioned in France, when the Nazis were coming, and did he mention it at all?

41:04.514 --> 41:07.517
No, I don't think so, because it was a little bit before.

41:07.858 --> 41:09.019
Yeah, he left in what?

41:09.039 --> 41:09.139
37.

41:09.179 --> 41:10.641
37.

41:10.781 --> 41:11.222
Yeah.

41:11.902 --> 41:15.467
So it was 39, that's where it was.

41:15.567 --> 41:16.568
Very, very bad.

41:17.930 --> 41:19.832
And the funny part of it,

41:20.588 --> 41:30.658
Where he was working, the man in charge told him, I think if I can give you any advice, it's getting very sort of sticky.

41:31.398 --> 41:35.222
If I were you, I would not come back on Monday.

41:36.043 --> 41:39.426
So he gave him a help there, and he didn't.

41:40.708 --> 41:42.069
He didn't come back to work to work?

41:42.089 --> 41:42.349
To work.

41:43.650 --> 41:48.435
He told him, it's better if you sort of just go now.

41:48.736 --> 41:52.484
Before it really gets sticky.

41:53.106 --> 41:55.872
And so did he mean just that Monday or like for good?

41:55.972 --> 41:56.513
No, for good.

41:57.014 --> 41:57.736
No, no, for good.

41:58.197 --> 42:00.522
So they were telling him something.

42:00.542 --> 42:01.444
Oh yes, they were.

42:02.226 --> 42:04.551
And he knew it from other people.

42:04.801 --> 42:05.362
He knew it.

42:05.382 --> 42:06.283
That was the time.

42:06.303 --> 42:09.488
The Nazis hadn't already taken over Paris at that point, had they?

42:09.508 --> 42:10.650
Oh, no, no, no.

42:10.770 --> 42:12.253
That was later.

42:12.373 --> 42:12.914
No, no.

42:12.974 --> 42:16.419
That was before the war.

42:16.499 --> 42:19.204
The war only started in September 1939.

42:19.224 --> 42:21.607
That's right.

42:21.768 --> 42:22.289
No, no.

42:22.429 --> 42:30.842
But you see, if you had your ears open and if you were understanding certain things,

42:32.206 --> 42:36.893
I went twice to Germany because I had to work in the library.

42:36.933 --> 42:38.556
That was also 35, 36.

42:39.798 --> 42:44.405
And I got very friendly with one S.R.

42:44.746 --> 42:45.166
Nazi.

42:45.547 --> 42:47.870
And we used to sort of discuss things.

42:47.891 --> 42:53.379
I mean, I was in Switzerland, so as I'm not Jewish, nothing was happening to me.

42:53.920 --> 42:59.108
But it was very interesting to see from one year to another what was happening and the views.

42:59.763 --> 43:11.496
And the funny part of it, I was playing with a Frau Director, because I was working at the Tübingen Library as what they call a practicanting, you know, practical work.

43:11.516 --> 43:20.265
And then this woman would not have taken me if I hadn't been the daughter of a professor.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.868
Papa, what snob she was.

43:23.573 --> 43:31.362
So she used to tell me when I came home for lunch, and so on.

43:31.462 --> 43:49.682
And then she asked me once if I would be kind enough to, there was a student who would come for lunch because that was part of what Hitler was doing to try these poor students

43:50.017 --> 43:54.232
to have an extra lunch in a rather well-to-do family.

43:54.253 --> 43:56.601
So I said, sure, because she said, I won't be there.

43:57.364 --> 44:00.415
So what happened?

44:00.732 --> 44:02.295
I mean, we started talking.

44:02.315 --> 44:07.884
We got along so well talking that she told me, but this is not what I asked you.

44:07.904 --> 44:09.247
You just gave him the food.

44:09.607 --> 44:11.310
You're not supposed to talk to him.

44:11.871 --> 44:17.641
So I really was upset because this was not at all my attitude.

44:18.403 --> 44:24.934
But I've seen quite a number of things happening before, and that was in 36, I think, 35, 36.

44:25.488 --> 44:28.851
Now the books, were these his own collection here?

44:28.992 --> 44:31.274
No, no, here he bought them.

44:31.314 --> 44:33.396
He came only with five books.

44:34.998 --> 44:36.199
All this is things here.

44:36.619 --> 44:42.205
By the way, there is this, you know that he did this for the Grody Club?

44:43.386 --> 44:43.446
No.

44:43.466 --> 44:45.408
Oh, The Truthful... The Truthful Lens.

44:45.969 --> 44:47.651
That is really a masterpiece.

44:47.791 --> 44:49.432
That was the premise for the Grody Club, huh?

44:49.452 --> 44:49.593
Yeah.

44:49.913 --> 44:51.074
It's out of print now.

44:51.975 --> 44:53.797
And the show was terrific.

44:53.877 --> 44:54.938
It was done with...

44:55.289 --> 45:04.137
with Neff from the Metropolitan Museum before he went to Getty.

45:04.838 --> 45:12.005
It's all books which are... I can actually give you this because I have an extra one.

45:12.025 --> 45:12.465
You're sure?

45:12.565 --> 45:13.206
Yeah, I have an extra one.

45:13.226 --> 45:13.866
That would be great.

45:13.906 --> 45:14.887
That'll explain it.

45:14.907 --> 45:15.688
I don't have to write it down here.

45:15.728 --> 45:16.449
Yeah, okay.

45:18.331 --> 45:23.035
Actually, it was books with original photographs.

45:24.567 --> 45:28.191
And it covers, I mean, all subjects, you know.

45:29.172 --> 45:33.337
I mean, science, anatomy, everything.

45:34.058 --> 45:35.440
Now, this was his idea to do that?

45:36.521 --> 45:42.608
I don't know if it was, but he is the one who invented the title, The Truthful Letter.

45:42.628 --> 45:43.570
And what did it mean to him?

45:44.451 --> 45:45.492
Oh, he was very happy.

45:46.333 --> 45:48.055
But what did the title mean?

45:48.095 --> 45:48.976
How did he invent it?

45:48.996 --> 45:53.241
Well, because he got interested in photographs, original photographs.

45:53.558 --> 45:58.144
You see this fellow who, oh, what's his name?

45:59.326 --> 46:05.334
It starts with a W. The one that died a few years ago.

46:05.835 --> 46:07.056
Had a huge collection.

46:07.737 --> 46:08.378
Photographs?

46:08.398 --> 46:14.947
Yeah, and his boyfriend was Mapo, what was it?

46:15.388 --> 46:16.810
Maple Farm.

46:17.030 --> 46:17.450
Maple Farm?

46:17.470 --> 46:18.352
Maple Farm.

46:19.874 --> 46:20.555
West End?

46:20.835 --> 46:21.055
No.

46:21.196 --> 46:22.317
West End.

46:22.820 --> 46:24.362
Maple Forbes was the photographer?

46:24.382 --> 46:25.784
The photographer, yeah.

46:25.804 --> 46:28.427
But this man was the one who had the money.

46:28.847 --> 46:32.352
And then he did ceramics, he bought ceramics and all that.

46:32.652 --> 46:40.662
But what I mean is that Lucien, he was also his customer, and Lucien was interested in him.

46:41.663 --> 46:46.509
So this gentleman was a collector too, is that right?

46:46.529 --> 46:47.190
Western Neff?

46:47.530 --> 46:48.551
Western Neff, no.

46:48.591 --> 46:50.093
He was a curator.

46:50.309 --> 46:54.434
of photography at the Metropolitan Museum.

46:54.654 --> 46:54.854
I see.

46:54.874 --> 46:55.535
Is he still alive?

46:55.635 --> 46:56.616
No, of course.

46:56.776 --> 46:57.877
He's at the Getty.

46:58.398 --> 47:02.082
He's in charge of the whole collection of photographs at the Getty.

47:02.522 --> 47:03.003
Neff is?

47:03.484 --> 47:03.764
Neff.

47:03.924 --> 47:06.547
I'll give him a call.

47:06.567 --> 47:09.150
He's a very easy-going.

47:09.190 --> 47:12.353
He talks like this and very easy-going.

47:12.393 --> 47:14.055
He belongs to the Groni Club.

47:14.195 --> 47:14.936
Good.

47:14.956 --> 47:15.697
I'll give him a call.

47:15.717 --> 47:16.858
I know some people at the Getty.

47:17.419 --> 47:17.639
Yeah.

47:17.719 --> 47:18.460
I like to get

47:19.638 --> 47:21.240
things from lots of people.

47:21.260 --> 47:23.082
Well, sure, that's the only way to do it.

47:23.182 --> 47:29.068
It's like a... But that is a beautiful, very well done.

47:30.189 --> 47:34.073
So he was really interested in expanding his knowledge, wasn't he?

47:34.154 --> 47:34.894
No, never.

47:35.375 --> 47:43.343
It was always... And as I say, I mean, except that he was a little bit annoyed when it became with computers.

47:43.784 --> 47:45.125
We hadn't got into that.

47:45.245 --> 47:46.787
Probably he would have later on.

47:46.807 --> 47:48.128
There's a clip in there.

47:48.148 --> 47:48.649
He probably won't.

47:51.110 --> 47:57.578
Oh, that is probably... Well, here's his name right here.

47:58.479 --> 47:59.780
Here's the fellow you're looking for.

48:00.381 --> 48:01.502
Yeah, Wagstaff.

48:01.522 --> 48:02.323
There we are.

48:02.363 --> 48:03.445
You're right.

48:03.465 --> 48:03.945
Wagstaff.

48:03.965 --> 48:04.726
Wagstaff.

48:04.746 --> 48:05.207
Yeah.

48:05.227 --> 48:06.949
I'm just going to write down the date when this is in.

48:06.969 --> 48:08.731
Maybe you can even Xerox this for me.

48:10.933 --> 48:11.074
Sam.

48:15.919 --> 48:17.241
This was folded into that.

48:17.261 --> 48:18.222
Yeah, probably.

48:18.242 --> 48:20.745
Well, that's Hilton Kramer that wrote this.

48:21.637 --> 48:25.763
The days when picture books had real pictures, yeah.

48:27.685 --> 48:32.271
Of course, it all gets very... Now, Lucien, I mean, you can see what a collector is.

48:32.572 --> 48:39.601
He gets all these little bits, and since he died, you have no idea, the little bits of paper here and there.

48:40.382 --> 48:41.083
It's dreadful.

48:41.844 --> 48:43.326
And that's his notes, you see?

48:44.328 --> 48:44.528
Uh-huh.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.591
See, we just found something, didn't we?

48:46.611 --> 48:47.071
Yeah, we did.

48:47.111 --> 48:48.353
Well, I mean...

48:48.772 --> 48:53.478
That you can take with your own.

48:53.498 --> 48:57.082
Original photographs, 1844 to 1914.

48:57.162 --> 48:58.964
So that was quite a remarkable one.

48:59.164 --> 49:00.065
I know, I know.

49:00.125 --> 49:10.517
And then you had to, you see, André Jam helped him a lot, because André Jam had a huge collection of photographs, of original photographs.

49:10.537 --> 49:13.581
He had André

49:13.882 --> 49:17.768
And he sold his collection also to the Getty.

49:17.848 --> 49:24.138
So the Getty has about three or four enormous collections, which they each bought for over $5 million.

49:24.158 --> 49:33.693
Now, did Lucien sell any photographs to the Getty into these... He must have, yeah, he must have, but I don't know... What was the other clip that we just found?

49:33.713 --> 49:41.745
Let me just write down what it was that was in there, just so I can find this in there, just so I can locate this.

49:43.649 --> 49:46.694
Oh, this must be a review of the show, right?

49:46.714 --> 49:47.055
Yeah, it is.

49:47.075 --> 49:48.818
It probably is, yeah.

49:48.838 --> 49:50.240
I'd forgotten it was in there.

49:51.322 --> 50:00.899
Sunday, December 29th, 1974, New York Times, page 22.

50:01.399 --> 50:05.527
I'll just get this out on a microphone.

50:05.547 --> 50:05.867
Okay.

50:05.887 --> 50:08.712
This must have been very interesting to your husband why he would put this away.

50:09.097 --> 50:12.401
Well, no, every time there was something out, he would keep it.

50:12.841 --> 50:37.247
Because this is really how a bibliophile collector... If you look at all the people in France, for instance, that have collected, I mean, for quite a long time, they have notes in their books about an auction where a similar book came out, or I don't know what.

50:39.944 --> 50:45.692
So that is really the... So he must have clipped it for this article, not this one.

50:45.712 --> 50:47.374
Yeah, but he didn't want to cut it up.

50:47.414 --> 50:49.998
That's what he did.

50:50.018 --> 50:51.480
I'm just trying to see what he did here.

50:52.881 --> 50:57.508
Very good.

50:57.528 --> 50:59.410
Oh, they're talking about their show.

50:59.430 --> 51:00.352
Okay, good.

51:00.372 --> 51:01.813
Excellent.

51:01.834 --> 51:04.237
So he must have done a lot of research.

51:04.537 --> 51:04.938
Oh, yes.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.660
He worked all the time.

51:07.872 --> 51:15.100
Were there any collections in particular that he took special pride in having helped build that you can think of?

51:15.120 --> 51:15.440
No.

51:19.625 --> 51:21.887
My memory isn't so good in that respect.

51:21.927 --> 51:24.270
I mean, there must be several.

51:26.292 --> 51:37.204
Once he got a whole, it was a piece of luggage from an old woman and

51:37.505 --> 51:49.900
She came, I don't know how he got to know, but as the shop was open, it was easy to come in and, you know, we were well known at the New York Public Library or the Met, the Met was so close to us.

51:50.460 --> 51:52.923
It was at 83rd and Madison, our shop.

51:54.044 --> 51:55.046
1117.

51:55.786 --> 52:06.539
And then this case was absolutely full of prints that her husband must have collected.

52:06.659 --> 52:07.360
So there was

52:07.694 --> 52:13.501
for years and years a source, because I think we paid her for a big sum for the whole thing.

52:13.841 --> 52:18.026
But there was always more and more in that relief, so that was interesting.

52:19.468 --> 52:33.364
You don't mind my asking, jumping around with the questions, but when you went on these shopping trips, so to speak, to Europe, did you have an idea of collections that would be available because of the war, that prices might be good?

52:33.614 --> 52:36.538
people might be more willing, let's say, to sell things?

52:36.678 --> 52:36.878
To sell?

52:37.199 --> 52:38.581
No, I don't think so.

52:38.721 --> 53:01.832
I don't think he had... But there was quite a movement of... Oh, yes, there was a tremendous amount of books, because when he first came back from the war, I remember that the booksellers here, all the foreign ones, were all sort of queuing up because he wanted to see what he'd brought in, and he had some lovely stuff.

53:03.382 --> 53:04.564
You don't know where he went.

53:04.604 --> 53:06.046
Did he go to private homes?

53:06.306 --> 53:07.848
Oh, a bit of everything, yeah.

53:07.868 --> 53:11.893
And then somebody told him about this one when he started talking.

53:12.094 --> 53:14.797
And then, you know, you get to know this.

53:15.859 --> 53:17.481
And you said Harvard, Yale.

53:17.501 --> 53:20.224
Can you think of any other institutions he might have helped?

53:20.985 --> 53:23.088
Oh, well, there's also Texas there.

53:23.128 --> 53:24.290
What is that fellow?

53:24.390 --> 53:24.610
Oh, Texas.

53:24.630 --> 53:25.351
Oh, yes.

53:25.371 --> 53:28.135
Harry Ransom and Tom Staley down in Texas.

53:28.235 --> 53:30.658
Yeah, but before that, isn't there a fellow?

53:31.059 --> 53:31.840
Wallen Roberts.

53:32.681 --> 53:32.781
Yeah.

53:32.963 --> 53:34.866
And also California.

53:35.407 --> 53:36.508
Oh, well, nice.

53:36.528 --> 53:36.809
Oh.

53:37.890 --> 53:39.533
And also Chicago.

53:39.553 --> 53:41.275
There's Jim Wells.

53:41.376 --> 53:44.160
He was a very good friend of Jim Wells.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.001
He's still alive.

53:45.221 --> 53:45.782
Jim Wells.

53:45.842 --> 53:47.425
Now, he was at the University of Chicago?

53:48.606 --> 53:49.788
The Newbury Library.

53:49.808 --> 53:50.429
Oh, the Newbury Library.

53:50.529 --> 53:50.950
Yeah.

53:51.070 --> 53:51.571
Oh, yes.

53:51.651 --> 53:53.894
And also the fellow that took over.

53:53.954 --> 53:54.635
What's his name?

53:55.136 --> 53:57.480
It starts with a T, I think.

53:57.500 --> 53:57.640
Yeah.

53:57.660 --> 53:59.843
So I'll check the Newbury too.

53:59.863 --> 54:01.946
So that's... And all the museum.

54:01.966 --> 54:02.447
There's...

54:02.680 --> 54:12.789
For instance, there was Joachim, who was in charge, the director of the museum.

54:13.370 --> 54:14.010
Which museum?

54:14.791 --> 54:15.812
In Chicago.

54:15.872 --> 54:16.613
Oh, I see.

54:17.313 --> 54:18.575
What's it called?

54:18.595 --> 54:19.015
The Field Museum?

54:19.035 --> 54:20.056
No, no, not Field.

54:20.436 --> 54:22.258
Oh, the Art Institute.

54:22.518 --> 54:24.360
The Art Institute of Chicago.

54:24.380 --> 54:25.341
Yeah, I think so.

54:25.881 --> 54:27.983
And now there's a fellow, I also know him.

54:28.083 --> 54:30.966
Is he called Dvorak or somebody like that?

54:31.081 --> 54:32.023
Oh, sure.

54:32.243 --> 54:47.248
Oh, and there was Mrs. Lambert was a very, the architect who did that beautiful, not a museum, but, well, it is a museum, in Montreal.

54:47.468 --> 54:51.936
You know, she created that architectural museum.

54:52.537 --> 54:53.338
Oh, sure, yeah.

54:53.899 --> 54:55.401
Phyllis Lambert.

54:55.422 --> 54:55.722
Oh, okay, yeah.

54:55.955 --> 55:00.261
Oh, she used to come every time and we got her wonderful collections.

55:00.662 --> 55:15.783
Lucien once also got the whole leftover from an architect that had done the, in Paris, one of the theaters, I think.

55:15.803 --> 55:19.548
But there was a huge amount of these drawings.

55:20.429 --> 55:25.236
And he was called Rouault de Fleury, I think his name was.

55:25.739 --> 55:34.491
And did he buy basically for stock, or did he buy it for collect, for... Well, he bought it for stock because he made this catalog.

55:34.871 --> 55:39.497
By what he got, he could figure out what we can make with what we have.

55:39.517 --> 55:47.568
We can make, say, a catalog on, I don't know, 18th century this, or so on.

55:48.129 --> 55:50.432
So what do you like to do with certain themes for each other?

55:50.452 --> 55:52.615
Well, you have to see what you get.

55:52.675 --> 55:54.177
You can't do it in advance.

55:55.388 --> 56:04.357
Except when it's come with this one, where every time he found a book that might mean something, then he would put it aside.

56:04.617 --> 56:07.961
So he would basically do themes, though, in his catalogs?

56:08.621 --> 56:11.364
Yeah, sections, yeah, because it was never the same.

56:13.146 --> 56:16.149
He would never just do a catalog with various miscellaneous items?

56:16.169 --> 56:18.391
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:18.651 --> 56:23.556
We had to do something that was... You see, there was also the...

56:24.262 --> 56:33.156
shall we say, not the aesthetic side, which was very, very polished, shall we say.

56:35.761 --> 56:38.165
So every catalogue was like a production, really.

56:38.185 --> 56:38.505
Yes.

56:38.525 --> 56:39.547
It was a performance.

56:40.148 --> 56:41.470
Yeah, it was a performance.

56:41.490 --> 56:42.331
It was a performance.

56:42.351 --> 56:42.572
Yeah.

56:42.952 --> 56:46.458
And that is the thing that... I think we can use that.

56:46.478 --> 56:48.161
Is that a fair statement?

56:48.181 --> 56:48.501
Yeah.

56:48.521 --> 56:50.725
No, no, I would say that it was a performance.

56:51.532 --> 56:52.773
I like that, don't you think so?

56:52.794 --> 56:53.675
Yeah, I think so.

56:53.715 --> 56:55.857
Almost like a production, like a play, like a book.

56:55.877 --> 56:56.418
Yes, like a play.

56:56.458 --> 56:58.220
Well, exactly.

56:59.502 --> 57:03.727
I mean, he did make a film because now it's all with films now.

57:04.287 --> 57:06.710
Videos and films.

57:06.730 --> 57:06.950
No.

57:08.592 --> 57:13.358
See, that was almost a very humanistic point of view that he took towards his bookselling.

57:13.518 --> 57:13.799
Yeah.

57:13.919 --> 57:15.020
He put things together.

57:15.120 --> 57:19.125
He would study them and then explain them in their context.

57:19.645 --> 57:23.071
Did anyone ever buy on block, buy entire catalogs?

57:23.171 --> 57:25.074
No, no, nobody did.

57:25.094 --> 57:35.452
As I say, he would have liked to have had this one, and he thought one person would, but apparently it didn't work.

57:36.193 --> 57:40.700
Now, you told me that there was another fellow, Dickinson, who was contacting you on this?

57:40.720 --> 57:42.383
Was he asking basically the same things?

57:42.423 --> 57:44.607
Well, he had...

57:45.447 --> 57:51.154
actually a piece that he had written, because he did this by letter.

57:51.675 --> 57:52.115
Oh, I see.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.098
And he wanted me to correct it.

57:54.118 --> 57:54.378
Oh, I see.

57:54.398 --> 57:56.561
And I corrected it, and I added things.

57:57.101 --> 58:05.031
Then he sent it back to me, because he said he had... the whole book is on different book setters.

58:05.051 --> 58:05.352
I see.

58:05.372 --> 58:09.717
That have come from Europe, and have sort of...

58:10.321 --> 58:13.406
I would say made the market, but created a market.

58:13.506 --> 58:15.830
Before them, there wasn't a market.

58:16.912 --> 58:18.234
Well, a market for what?

58:18.254 --> 58:26.728
For books, for, I mean, for, not anti... Specifically.

58:26.748 --> 58:30.854
Yes, well, it's more antiquarian, antiquariat.

58:31.375 --> 58:33.218
That is what it is.

58:33.238 --> 58:36.784
The antiquariat is really what these people wrote.

58:37.085 --> 58:43.212
And so his, you would say, the market that Lucien created would have been this lead artist, the artist?

58:43.252 --> 58:46.176
Also, yes, but also old books.

58:46.356 --> 58:51.722
I mean, even we had Bibles, ancient Bibles, and we had one or two manuscripts.

58:51.742 --> 58:57.809
We even had a collection of music items.

58:57.929 --> 58:59.491
Now, who was this man?

58:59.851 --> 59:00.392
Oh, la la.

59:01.182 --> 59:03.065
We had the whole of his collection.

59:03.165 --> 59:06.470
We had to start making a catalogue.

59:06.810 --> 59:10.155
I don't have that catalogue anymore.

59:11.918 --> 59:15.723
That's okay.

59:16.544 --> 59:18.167
Well, I mean, there is so much.

59:18.187 --> 59:25.317
I think we've got a lot of stuff here.

59:25.533 --> 59:28.457
I don't want to conflict with Dickinson in any way.

59:28.477 --> 59:29.719
I mean, I'll try to do... No, no.

59:29.899 --> 59:34.046
He is really a real librarian.

59:34.066 --> 59:34.206
Uh-huh.

59:34.767 --> 59:37.391
And he... He's called Dickinson, I think.

59:37.411 --> 59:38.352
John Dickinson.

59:38.372 --> 59:39.133
He's in Arizona.

59:39.153 --> 59:39.874
I know who he is.

59:39.894 --> 59:41.136
Yes, Arizona, Tucson.

59:41.156 --> 59:41.537
Right.

59:41.557 --> 59:42.298
Yes.

59:42.318 --> 59:46.003
But he wanted to do... I think that book is coming out.

59:46.184 --> 59:46.604
I see.

59:46.624 --> 59:47.045
Good.

59:47.065 --> 59:53.214
And he wanted one chapter, let's say about two or three pages, on each of these book sets.

59:53.534 --> 59:53.715
I see.

59:53.935 --> 59:55.337
And he had some amount.

59:55.604 --> 01:00:02.256
But it's also through Barney Rosenthal that he got my name, and that's how it started.

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:09.530
So Barney insisted that I, really suggested that I see you and also... But you know, I'm a bit annoyed with Barney.

01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:15.321
He comes to the glory cloud, he even sees me, and he hardly says hello to me.

01:00:15.341 --> 01:00:17.625
It's, oh, this is what I can't understand.

01:00:17.645 --> 01:00:19.148
What's the matter with them?

01:00:21.254 --> 01:00:24.782
I knew his brother very well at Oxford, you know.

01:00:24.823 --> 01:00:25.564
I'll be, I think.

01:00:25.745 --> 01:00:26.787
A wonderful fellow.

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:29.474
I was in England last week, and I was hoping to see him.

01:00:29.514 --> 01:00:30.376
I didn't have time.

01:00:30.817 --> 01:00:31.960
Isn't he retired now?

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.684
It's his daughter that came over.

01:00:33.724 --> 01:00:34.987
That's right.

01:00:35.027 --> 01:00:36.250
His daughter was with Barney.

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.172
In fact, they were together.

01:00:37.794 --> 01:00:38.014
Oh, really?
