Mrs. O'Moore, my name is Nick Bazbaines.

We spoke briefly a number of months ago, and I wrote you a letter.

00:43.111 --> 00:50.141
I've been writing a book about the formation of libraries and book collections, and I've been eager to talk to your husband about the garden.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.507
I've been trying to get in touch with either you or your husband.

01:46.668 --> 01:48.910
I would very much like to speak to Dr. O'Moore.

01:49.611 --> 01:52.194
We met briefly at the garden sale last year.

01:52.294 --> 01:56.298
I indicated to him how I am writing a book about the formation of book collections.

Thank you.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.110
Yes, Mr. Waxman.

02:54.390 --> 02:56.193
My name is Nick Bazbaines.

02:56.213 --> 02:57.876
I'm a writer from Massachusetts.

02:58.637 --> 03:03.926
I'm doing a book on the formation of book collections in libraries, and I would like to talk to you.

03:03.986 --> 03:06.570
Perhaps you saw my piece in the New York Times Book Review.

03:07.192 --> 03:27.985
couple weeks ago i am writing a book and i think that we have some things we could talk about i can be reached at 508-839-4404

03:28.943 --> 03:33.329
You're telling me about... I told you that this is an important book about an important woman.

03:33.669 --> 03:35.572
She was the most powerful woman in America.

03:35.592 --> 03:38.356
And on the face of it, no, would a hairdresser matter?

03:39.337 --> 03:40.419
No, that's all it was.

03:40.499 --> 03:57.482
But this was the first lady saying... What will it tell us about... This was the first lady bumping... Bumping the White House photographer, who's supposed to be recording history, just so her hairdresser can get on to take pictures of this... What does it tell us about the presidency?

03:58.188 --> 03:58.689
Wow.

03:59.670 --> 04:06.076
As Geraldine Ferraro said about two weeks ago on TV in New York, they asked her, they said, do you believe everything in this book?

04:06.096 --> 04:07.678
She said, I sure do.

04:07.698 --> 04:09.420
And it sure answers that one question.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.781
Can a woman run the White House?

04:11.061 --> 04:12.743
And I think it's important there are four books.

04:12.783 --> 04:14.785
He's not yet been sued by anybody.

04:16.387 --> 04:17.608
Exactly.

04:17.809 --> 04:23.014
Well, Frank Snatcher sued before I'd written the word, but he had to drop the lawsuit.

04:22.994 --> 04:26.761
And also, Nick, I write about people who are alive.

04:27.302 --> 04:30.207
It's a lot harder to write about people who are alive.

04:30.628 --> 04:43.872
And the process of documentation that I had to go through, I mean, these people were saying, I have alienated the establishment press corps with this book because this book shows the press asleep at the wheel.

04:43.852 --> 04:46.280
So they're taking out after the messenger.

04:46.902 --> 04:50.594
But the standards of documentation is, look, we're excruciating.

04:51.356 --> 04:52.359
Batteries of lawyers.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.824
They're here.

04:53.904 --> 04:55.650
This is Christopher Lodd.
