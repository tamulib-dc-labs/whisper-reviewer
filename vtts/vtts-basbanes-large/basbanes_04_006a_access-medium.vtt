WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:11.333
I had a holiday and they told me that you were going to be busy this month.

00:11.353 --> 00:17.579
I'm trying to save up some time and not do anything.

00:17.599 --> 00:21.223
The rest of the month, August too, to get back to work on that.

00:21.243 --> 00:24.626
Now, is this going to be a continuation of the Albany cycle?

00:24.646 --> 00:26.868
No, it's another in the cycle.

00:26.888 --> 00:28.069
It's called Quinn's Book.

00:29.030 --> 00:29.871
Q-U-I-N-N.

00:30.332 --> 00:32.794
Apostraphe S.

00:32.814 --> 00:32.974
And

00:33.713 --> 00:37.596
I've sold it to Vikings.

00:37.616 --> 00:40.299
I'm going to have a problem.

00:40.479 --> 00:41.220
No problem.

00:41.240 --> 00:41.520
Except this.

00:41.540 --> 00:45.964
No, it won't pick up on here.

00:45.984 --> 00:46.284
Let's just see.

00:46.304 --> 00:48.526
I'll just put it close to you right there.

00:48.546 --> 00:48.987
I'm sorry.

00:49.027 --> 00:50.208
So we're talking about Quinn's book.

00:51.028 --> 00:53.671
Well, it starts in 1849.

00:53.791 --> 01:01.678
And it'll go somewhere to the post-Civil War era.

01:02.165 --> 01:08.114
maybe even to 1880, I'm not exactly sure, about that range of time.

01:08.134 --> 01:31.868
And it's a story of a couple, it starts off with a couple of kids, a boy and a girl, and as they grow up together, and it ranges over a lot of theatrical life, very canal life, civil war, home,

01:33.569 --> 01:38.894
The descendants, I gather, of the people we've met.

01:39.935 --> 01:42.538
Ancestors of George Quinn.

01:42.598 --> 01:44.580
Antecedents.

01:44.740 --> 01:48.323
Antecedents, I'm sorry.

01:48.524 --> 01:50.105
That's exactly it.

01:50.505 --> 02:01.416
But it's a more ambitious book in the sense that there'll be a larger scope of family life, the range of

02:01.801 --> 02:03.945
Albany history will be suggested.

02:04.746 --> 02:10.958
Certain families that we haven't quite met yet will be established.

02:10.978 --> 02:15.045
Katrina's family, Taylor's, Ms.

02:15.065 --> 02:24.923
Statz's, and a new line which will correspond to a latter-day political family.

02:27.097 --> 02:29.360
I mean, I'm really... Pardon?

02:29.721 --> 02:32.565
Any types of characters?

02:32.585 --> 02:35.489
I mean, you've really made a mark.

02:35.509 --> 02:55.298
Yeah, well, there'll be... There'll be some, I think there'll be some, you know, continuation of that... Demi-monde, or whatever you call it, where some of my people live, but

02:56.189 --> 02:57.491
There's more to it than that.

02:57.591 --> 03:17.860
There'll be, you know, there's an aristocratic line that's developed in this, there's an old Dutch family that, which is really the center of the structure of the story, revolve around one particular family and a continuity and a

03:18.835 --> 03:22.298
Are we going to see more of the... How do you pronounce it?

03:22.318 --> 03:23.939
Is it Phelan or Phelan?

03:23.959 --> 03:25.120
Phelan.

03:25.140 --> 03:25.320
Phelan.

03:25.340 --> 03:26.582
That is a question.

03:26.602 --> 03:32.386
There are a number of people around Worcester who have Phelan roots, and they said, ask him how he pronounces it.

03:32.406 --> 03:33.547
Yeah, definitely.

03:34.028 --> 03:36.690
A lot of people say Phelan, but that's not Phelan.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.353
I mean, maybe it's pronounced that way some places in Ireland, but I never heard it.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.395
It was always Phelan.

03:42.415 --> 03:43.696
Around here, it was always Phelan.

03:43.876 --> 03:45.938
Do you expect it to be getting back to Phelan?

03:45.978 --> 03:48.640
You kind of left us in a quandary with him.

03:48.620 --> 04:17.192
maybe not as far as you're concerned no I'm not I don't have any problems with him I know some people do but I may do something again with him I may go back and pick him up in a point before Ironweed I don't know I have no plans for that at the moment there is a there is a

04:18.033 --> 04:24.701
A book that I started, well, I finished, I mean, it was really my first serious novel.

04:27.004 --> 04:32.710
It's called The Angels and the Sparrows, and that's where Francis Phelan came out of.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.631
Good, thank you.

04:33.651 --> 04:43.223
The whole Phelan family and his return home, which is alluded to in both Billy and in Ironweed.

04:43.243 --> 04:46.026
They have to be read as a pair.

04:46.046 --> 04:47.027
I read things.

04:47.902 --> 04:51.828
You know, I've read Ironweed first and Billy second.

04:51.848 --> 04:54.532
I think they have to be read Billy first.

04:54.552 --> 04:56.596
Well, I don't think they end in the same day.

04:57.056 --> 04:58.118
It's a different point of view.

04:58.478 --> 05:08.674
You do learn certain things about Francis and Billy that might be helpful, but you don't really need that.

05:09.876 --> 05:10.357
I agree.

05:11.158 --> 05:13.622
But I think that they're enjoyed better.

05:13.973 --> 05:14.834
Oh, that could be.

05:14.954 --> 05:16.016
I don't know about that.

05:16.036 --> 05:23.848
Well, just chronologically, I mean, there were events with Billy that really bear on Ironweed, I think.

05:24.328 --> 05:29.476
The meeting between the son and the father.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.678
I'm going to bring off the turkey.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.419
And I wasn't aware.

05:31.459 --> 05:34.864
You know, I picked these things up just blind.

05:34.884 --> 05:41.975
I mean, I'm going to start Ironweed, and then I love them so much, I'll let the others look in a week.

05:41.995 --> 05:42.175
You know?

05:42.340 --> 05:56.526
I think that the unities of time are very important to you in these particular books, the classic unities, or there's a joy scene in that respect, and one that's probably Aristotelian.

05:56.546 --> 06:01.154
I am Aristotelian down here.

06:01.174 --> 06:02.256
But...

06:04.295 --> 06:06.678
The unity is fine.

06:07.159 --> 06:24.042
Yeah, well, the sense of place and time, it seems that I was always, I was very much influenced at a certain stage by playwrights.

06:24.629 --> 06:40.080
really that's what Aristotle was talking about, the theater, the poetry in the theater, as opposed to what we've come to think of the latter to the times in the communities.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.385
But my feeling of

06:43.664 --> 07:02.025
It was always important to see the dramatic nucleus.

07:02.085 --> 07:09.194
I'd play it back on a larger machine.

07:09.214 --> 07:11.376
We were talking about Aristotle.

07:11.930 --> 07:19.273
Well, I'd rather... You know, your notion of talking about my feeling about the unities,

07:20.570 --> 07:23.453
I don't know what direction to take that.

07:23.493 --> 07:25.175
I don't know how your vision is.

07:25.195 --> 07:31.082
Well, that was just an observation rather than a question anyway.

07:31.102 --> 07:44.036
Well, I had the sense, though, when I was reading it, and I'm always aware of, you know, we've only gone through four nights so far, and it's really a tight, tight book.

07:44.056 --> 07:50.543
I mean, we really have pared it down and focused on just a few days in this man's life.

07:51.569 --> 07:56.978
Well, I'll be doing something quite different in the next book.

07:57.299 --> 08:14.488
I think I was instructed in the short story and the drama more than in the sprawling 19th century novel when I first began to write, and I suppose that influence is still important to me.

08:14.907 --> 08:23.142
I, you know, I also think about Joyce, he did Ulysses, 18 hours, is that it?

08:25.887 --> 08:38.991
So much of The Sound and the Fury takes place in a few days, in a significant climactic time.

08:41.789 --> 08:46.517
Have you had a chance to see the new Ulysses, which is just... I have not.

08:46.677 --> 08:48.320
You just got mine.

08:48.520 --> 08:48.700
No.

08:49.362 --> 08:56.874
I just read the review again that Elman wrote in the Times, and I'm very anxious to get it.

08:56.894 --> 08:59.899
Which is kind of curious, because I noticed he was one of the...

09:01.820 --> 09:10.489
Well, you mean the fact that they let him review it?

09:10.509 --> 09:10.830
Yeah.

09:10.930 --> 09:16.876
Well, somehow, I think he's above the mob scene.

09:17.316 --> 09:25.705
I mean, it's better to have his biased opinion than anybody else's unbiased, ill-informed opinion.

09:25.725 --> 09:27.287
He's marvelous.

09:27.267 --> 09:37.659
I just, I've been reading again, I mean, I read it almost all the time, his biography, which I was thinking about, and then dip in and out of it.

09:37.739 --> 09:40.247
I just got the new one.

09:41.543 --> 09:46.790
But I will get your list, because I'm curious, 5,000 errors.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.332
So many of them are common.

09:49.053 --> 09:49.334
Are they?

09:49.354 --> 09:50.055
Is that what it is?

09:50.075 --> 09:57.945
I mean, but what they have is on the right-hand side, you get two basic pages, and it reads in sequence.

09:57.965 --> 10:04.294
And on the left side, they show you where they've made changes, and they've got a, it looks like hieroglyphics, and there's just a plethora of...

10:04.628 --> 10:10.195
symbols to indicate overlays, underlays, transliterations, all that stuff.

10:10.375 --> 10:11.036
Is it worth it?

10:11.076 --> 10:12.497
I wanted to read it.

10:12.517 --> 10:14.920
Well, Random's bringing out a trade edition of two years.

10:15.641 --> 10:20.467
And I'm sure that would be priced at no bottom.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.508
What is this one?

10:21.528 --> 10:22.089
Two hundred bucks.

10:22.109 --> 10:23.611
Oh, well.

10:23.791 --> 10:28.877
I'm sure you can get me some review copy.

10:28.897 --> 10:32.361
I have no time to review it.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.302
Listen, so I'm very

10:35.088 --> 10:39.792
I'm very curious to get into a couple of areas of life.

10:39.812 --> 10:39.912
Sure.

10:39.932 --> 10:50.062
I wonder, I mean, the extraordinary changes that have taken place in real life in the last year and a half, I guess.

10:50.082 --> 10:50.202
Right.

10:50.222 --> 10:50.442
Just about.

10:50.462 --> 10:51.883
Have you reflected on these?

10:52.043 --> 10:53.405
No, I haven't.

10:54.085 --> 11:04.875
Mike Levitas at the Times keeps asking me to write a piece for him on the whole event, the changes, and how I respond to it.

11:05.041 --> 11:08.865
But I don't feel comfortable doing that yet.

11:08.885 --> 11:14.110
What I feel is that it's too new.

11:14.891 --> 11:24.921
All I'll be doing is recounting a lot of interviews and things I've said.

11:24.941 --> 11:28.024
I have no clear perspective on it.

11:28.045 --> 11:32.449
I haven't stopped running yet.

11:34.252 --> 11:40.059
I don't know if they're going to let me stop for a while.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.406
This summer I'm really aiming.

11:45.426 --> 11:47.549
I'm writing a piece now for Vanity Fair.

11:51.234 --> 11:53.176
I presume Vanity Fair will like it.

11:53.196 --> 11:53.797
I don't know.

11:53.817 --> 11:56.901
I'm at a cotton club.

11:57.978 --> 12:08.294
I have been on it for a year with that call that just came in.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.698
They're still working on it.

12:10.718 --> 12:15.906
They're still rewriting, redoing the dialogue.

12:15.926 --> 12:17.809
They're doing what they call looping now.

12:18.430 --> 12:24.435
Richard Gere is coming in on the 16th to do some looping, and I want to go down and watch and see what it's all about.

12:24.635 --> 12:25.076
Do you enjoy this?

12:25.576 --> 12:25.977
Yeah, I love it.

12:26.017 --> 12:27.658
I love the movies.

12:27.678 --> 12:33.343
I noticed you've got a VCR in there with tons of cassette tapes, so you must really watch them.

12:33.363 --> 12:34.244
I watch them all the time.

12:34.284 --> 12:39.369
We watched Yankee Doodle Dandy last time.

12:40.149 --> 12:47.796
No, the VCR was important for working on Cotton Club.

12:48.164 --> 13:07.773
I got tapes of it, and when I was rewriting, trying to, you know, giving Coppola notes on everything, and I mean, in the last month and a half, I worked, well, a month really, on the looping script.

13:07.793 --> 13:12.099
We've probably changed 25% of the dialogue again.

13:12.119 --> 13:13.902
How long have they planned this thing to run?

13:15.417 --> 13:16.739
A standard length movie?

13:16.759 --> 13:22.405
Oh, it's a two hour and a half movie total with credits for 220, 235, 40, something like that.

13:22.425 --> 13:23.787
I don't know exactly.

13:23.807 --> 13:24.948
Did you write your novels?

13:25.709 --> 13:30.114
Did you visualize them as possibly being scripts?

13:30.274 --> 13:31.536
No, no.

13:31.556 --> 13:33.998
I know they've all been sold now, haven't they?

13:34.018 --> 13:35.580
Well, no, they have.

13:35.660 --> 13:39.064
But that doesn't mean... The main truck has not.

13:40.406 --> 13:42.268
The other three have been optioned.

13:43.379 --> 13:44.421
And I'll write them all.

13:45.182 --> 13:58.604
But I feel that they have an integrity as novels.

13:58.624 --> 14:02.330
There's no way of transferring them.

14:02.350 --> 14:09.943
It's a huge problem to translate a novel to a movie.

14:10.987 --> 14:14.293
I'm surprised, actually, that you'd want to do the film treatment film.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.617
Or is this more or less protecting vested interest?

14:16.657 --> 14:17.498
Well, it's that.

14:18.259 --> 14:20.483
But it's also that I love the movies.

14:20.683 --> 14:21.525
I always have.

14:22.547 --> 14:37.011
I separate them very desperately from literature.

14:37.835 --> 14:52.328
anywhere near as complex, or you can't get at the human being the same way in the movies that you can.

14:52.348 --> 14:59.395
In a novel, I just finished the first draft of Legs, and what I left out is incredible.

14:59.415 --> 15:05.901
It'll be six years to write that novel, it'll be three months to write the screen for me.

15:07.298 --> 15:22.212
I mean, it's a boiling down, a reduction to a narrative line that makes sense, but with the same kind of dramatic power, I would hope, that certain of the scenes have.

15:23.293 --> 15:29.879
What you lose is all the introspection, all the interiority of the characters.

15:31.741 --> 15:33.863
The best you can get is a suggestion of it.

15:35.260 --> 15:39.904
couched in some dramatic moment.

15:40.364 --> 15:49.673
But you can't put that on the screen or else you'll put everybody to sleep.

15:49.693 --> 15:51.334
You mentioned Link's a really extraordinary novel.

15:51.354 --> 16:03.364
I think a few people would doubt that he is an evil man, a bad guy, and yet he's fascinating.

16:03.384 --> 16:05.166
And he even has many likable qualities, which I guess is true.

16:05.635 --> 16:25.450
Well, it started because he was killed in Albany, and he had become a local legend.

16:26.493 --> 16:30.678
You must understand, Albany is a wide-open town.

16:30.779 --> 16:39.991
I think I reflect that attitude in old Albany, the kind of prohibition history that we had in this town, the wide-open gambling.

16:40.531 --> 16:46.679
That's evidence during the Depression, long after prohibition has ended.

16:46.980 --> 16:50.684
Billy Salen, you get the same attitude.

16:50.724 --> 16:51.946
I grew up with that.

16:52.106 --> 16:55.791
I grew up with that world of nightclubs,

16:56.547 --> 17:16.108
gamblers, the legends of the hoodlums, the interlocking power structure of the nether world and the night world and the

17:17.084 --> 17:20.409
the political world that ran the city.

17:20.429 --> 17:24.796
And so that became a fascination for me, the whole mix.

17:24.816 --> 17:31.125
And Billy is the first real reflection on the political aspect of it.

17:31.145 --> 17:45.066
But Legs being a, probably the prime celebrity out of the jazz age, television,

17:46.565 --> 17:57.920
and being killed in Albany and having focused a good deal of his later years in Albany because he was persona non grata in New York City, that became fascinating to me.

17:59.282 --> 18:04.770
And I set out to use him in a political novel, and he just took over.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.775
His life was so complicated that when I began to track it,

18:09.397 --> 18:12.481
I found it fascinating because he was such a celebrity.

18:12.521 --> 18:16.907
That was the thing that really caught me, the fact that a gangster could be that much of a celebrity.

18:17.929 --> 18:31.467
And as I began to explore his life and talk to people who were alive in his day and hanging out in the same places, the people who met him had this indelible memory of him.

18:31.487 --> 18:34.771
It was like, where were you in Pearl Harbor?

18:34.791 --> 18:36.113
That's how you opened it, actually.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.455
They gathered to talk.

18:37.776 --> 18:38.897
Right.

18:39.265 --> 18:46.173
Absolutely, and those reminiscences are indelible in these people.

18:47.074 --> 18:52.880
I had so many of them after a while, it became very, very strange to me.

18:52.901 --> 18:53.761
Who was this guy?

18:53.822 --> 18:54.903
Why was he important?

18:55.183 --> 18:59.808
Why do we revere gangsters?

19:00.009 --> 19:03.012
Why the hell am I writing this book?

19:03.802 --> 19:05.346
Well, I think so.

19:07.050 --> 19:21.085
I don't think I answer it to the satisfaction of a sociologist, maybe, but what that book is, the way it's structured is the way everybody looks at it.

19:21.503 --> 19:30.434
I mean, if you look at Jack Diamond, he's not the center of consciousness by any means.

19:30.574 --> 19:31.355
Marcus is.

19:32.076 --> 19:45.233
But Marcus is also intersecting all the time with the way the press looks at him, the way they looked at him on Broadway in show business, the way Kiki looks at him, the way

19:45.922 --> 20:11.693
the goose looks at him the way his brother eddie diamond now are these real are these peripheral characters genuine are they actual well his brother was real kiki and alice were real marcus marcus is a composite of a set of attitudes that i perceived to exist uh i based them in

20:12.128 --> 20:13.310
a couple of lawyers.

20:13.550 --> 20:16.154
Bill Fallon was his lawyer at one point.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.759
He was the great mouthpiece.

20:18.799 --> 20:20.441
He was on a Rothstein's lawyer.

20:23.586 --> 20:29.175
He was also, Diamond also had a lawyer named Dan Pryor from Albany, but

20:30.185 --> 20:36.135
And he's probably closer to Dan Pryor than anything else, but not in his private life or in his personal thought.

20:36.756 --> 20:38.880
In his legal representation, yes.

20:39.101 --> 20:40.002
He's a composite.

20:40.142 --> 20:42.046
He's definitely a composite.

20:42.066 --> 20:47.215
But he's meant to be as much a character and not just a reflection of my ideas.

20:47.275 --> 20:53.205
Now, starting out with this, it's clearly not a biography, but it's biographical.

20:53.995 --> 20:57.439
Is it largely biographical or apocryphal or both?

20:57.780 --> 20:58.520
It's everything.

20:58.861 --> 21:14.900
I started out to write a meticulously researched novel, historically accurate, and I found out that that was all but impossible.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.543
All the sources are suspect.

21:18.124 --> 21:22.990
The best you can do is amalgamate them and hope for the best.

21:23.780 --> 21:36.455
I gave up trying to decide on who murdered who and who was responsible for these various assassination attempts.

21:36.995 --> 21:38.757
I think I know some of the answers.

21:38.817 --> 21:51.492
So you were looking for the sense of the man as opposed to the... Well, what I got after a while, what I decided after a while was to use all... I mentioned it, I think, at some point about

21:52.282 --> 22:00.597
The journalists' lies and stories and the lies were the most interesting part of their memories.

22:01.558 --> 22:04.764
And I began to use that.

22:04.784 --> 22:07.489
I used the lies, I used the...

22:09.747 --> 22:15.514
things that I knew were historically incorrect, if it suited my purpose.

22:17.137 --> 22:18.999
The outline of his life is accurate.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.144
He did shoot up the Hotsi Totsi Club.

22:23.184 --> 22:24.646
He did go into exile.

22:24.706 --> 22:30.133
He did create that booze and beer empire and the Catskills.

22:30.173 --> 22:35.400
He was that terrible desperado racketeering and

22:36.005 --> 22:39.108
terrorizing people in the mountains.

22:39.128 --> 22:41.671
He did come to Albany to play.

22:41.751 --> 22:48.158
He did have a girlfriend named Kiki Roberts and a wife named Alice and a brother named Eddie and so on.

22:48.178 --> 22:49.339
And he hung out in Albany.

22:49.379 --> 22:53.924
And a good deal of the detail of his time up here is very accurate.

22:53.944 --> 22:57.227
He even had a house he stayed in in Aero Park for a few nights.

22:57.968 --> 23:04.695
It's now known as the Lake Diamond House, even though it was meant as a hideout for Vincent Cole and his gang.

23:05.435 --> 23:25.100
But by using it all, I felt what I was doing was discovering one of these myths in progress that we're constantly creating in this country.

23:25.120 --> 23:30.767
People like Marilyn Monroe or Charles Lindbergh.

23:32.401 --> 23:48.708
maybe Erhard or Joe DiMaggio or whatever, these people, Muhammad Ali, who get into the center of the public eye and win the affection of the people for some reason that is very complex.

23:49.089 --> 23:52.655
It almost seems particular to that period, though.

23:52.976 --> 23:54.919
I mean, it doesn't happen so much today.

23:54.939 --> 23:56.942
We still have Muhammad Ali today.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.645
Yeah, but Muhammad Ali, I don't think.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.778
Well, in his time.

24:01.898 --> 24:15.451
He's lived beyond the power to maintain the mist in its same heightened status, but he was the best known human being in the world at one point there.

24:15.531 --> 24:28.564
And Marilyn, you know, I mean, she's not of the same age as Lindbergh.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.906
These people who are creatures of the media.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.298
I'm sorry.

24:36.318 --> 24:37.682
Go ahead.

24:37.702 --> 24:40.630
I was at the NBCC in January.

24:41.133 --> 24:42.515
received your award.

24:43.336 --> 24:46.920
I just loved you every month.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.623
And the publishing industry wasn't too pleased.

24:49.743 --> 24:51.245
Even your own house.

24:51.265 --> 24:53.007
I mentioned it before.

24:53.027 --> 24:54.349
I thought that was great as well.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.612
We were embarrassed.

24:56.632 --> 25:01.397
I mean, 13 houses out there that had some cycles.

25:01.417 --> 25:01.858
It's a fact.

25:02.007 --> 25:16.287
How can you explain the reluctant census?

25:16.307 --> 25:24.359
I mean, I'm sure you've been asked this, but there are 13 houses too.

25:24.379 --> 25:25.400
The reluctant census has been published.

25:25.420 --> 25:25.741
Obviously, good.

25:25.761 --> 25:26.061
It is literary.

25:26.081 --> 25:26.462
It's been accepted.

25:26.482 --> 25:27.263
People think marvelous things about it.

25:27.283 --> 25:27.764
How do you explain this?

25:27.784 --> 25:31.609
Well, I think that people were put off

25:32.669 --> 25:34.412
by two things.

25:34.432 --> 25:35.593
People meaning editors.

25:35.613 --> 25:38.618
Editors, first readers, whatever, whoever it was.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.041
I mean, good readers.

25:41.962 --> 25:53.599
The first thing that happens is if you track it from Viking first, their rejection was really a mutual separation.

25:55.562 --> 26:00.229
That has been not quite understood, and it's so complicated that

26:01.070 --> 26:03.393
It really isn't worth the effort to go into it.

26:03.754 --> 26:05.476
You had an editor and the editor left.

26:05.496 --> 26:08.120
You had a new editor.

26:08.140 --> 26:09.462
I don't really need all of this.

26:09.482 --> 26:10.043
That's right.

26:10.163 --> 26:17.133
But the thing is that their reasoning, I think, was different from everybody else's.

26:17.153 --> 26:28.789
Their reasoning, I would think, began with the fact that I hadn't made money on Billy Phelan and that they felt that this being what it looked like was a downbeat book.

26:30.011 --> 26:30.351
I don't think

26:30.905 --> 26:32.387
Everybody read it seriously.

26:34.390 --> 26:41.379
I think there's some very good people and editors at Viking.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.342
But they got very skittish about it.

26:43.662 --> 26:52.334
And they were going to publish it, but they were giving me an editor in Georgia.

26:52.354 --> 26:55.478
And I felt that that was unacceptable.

26:55.913 --> 27:02.423
That got their nose out of joint when I said no to that editor, even though she was a very good editor, but she didn't come to New York for two months.

27:04.266 --> 27:05.528
I might as well not have had an editor.

27:07.111 --> 27:19.711
I mean, just the actual working out of editing the copy as it went along, I didn't feel I needed that much editing.

27:20.633 --> 27:23.237
But that feeling...

27:23.555 --> 27:25.717
You know, they didn't do well with Billy Phelan.

27:27.019 --> 27:29.782
They handled it right.

27:29.802 --> 27:37.491
And Billy Phelan was perceived now by some people to be my best book.

27:37.511 --> 27:39.853
Some people feel that way.

27:39.953 --> 27:41.235
I don't.

27:42.076 --> 27:44.519
I like Billy Phelan.

27:44.539 --> 27:50.305
I mean, I love Billy, but I think

27:51.601 --> 27:56.306
I think more seems to happen in Billy.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.688
Not that that's a necessity.

27:57.708 --> 28:05.416
I don't know, it's hard to pick between you two, but I think they should be read whole, and I think they're really two parts of one book.

28:05.436 --> 28:06.497
Maybe I'm going on that.

28:06.517 --> 28:08.099
They certainly have parallel, there's no question about that.

28:08.439 --> 28:15.887
Well, they're meant to be, and they, for whatever reasons, you know, people...

28:16.897 --> 28:18.679
Didn't like that book.

28:18.939 --> 28:22.923
It didn't get the attention that it's gotten since.

28:23.043 --> 28:26.766
I mean, it's sold enormously well ever since.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.368
All the books are selling very well.

28:29.449 --> 28:43.782
But once that happened and I parted company with Viking, then suddenly you have that cloud over you, you know, which every editor is going to say, well, why didn't Viking do it?

28:44.420 --> 29:03.576
You know, and so you get this, you look at it that way, that's one way of saying it, but the other way is that they figure it's got a black mark on it, and they look first for the black mark.

29:03.877 --> 29:04.918
What do they find?

29:04.938 --> 29:07.421
Do they know that it's gone through such and such a house?

29:07.501 --> 29:10.164
Well, they know if I'm... You're a Viking writer.

29:10.184 --> 29:10.564
Right.

29:10.584 --> 29:17.632
Now you're over... A lot of them called my editor, previous editor, and said, what's the story?

29:17.692 --> 29:20.035
How come you're not running?

29:20.055 --> 29:21.216
And he got to what?

29:21.296 --> 29:24.880
What he said, I had no idea.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.182
Are you bitter about this?

29:26.202 --> 29:26.502
No.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.824
No, no, I'm hardly bitter.

29:28.905 --> 29:32.989
I think Viking has done wonders for the books.

29:33.661 --> 29:38.628
Did you ever lose faith in yourself as a writer?

29:38.648 --> 29:39.369
No, I never did.

29:39.389 --> 29:49.724
I have trying times, certainly, in seeing the book, too, with press, but I mean, in terms of any second out, well, Jesus, what did I do wrong with this book?

29:49.744 --> 29:52.087
Were you ever plagued by any thoughts like this?

29:52.408 --> 29:53.089
Not like that.

29:54.631 --> 29:57.475
My thought was more along the line of...

29:58.180 --> 29:59.922
All right, I've written this book.

29:59.942 --> 30:01.203
I believe in it the way it is.

30:02.765 --> 30:08.351
I think it's as good a book as I'll ever write up to this time.

30:10.113 --> 30:11.554
I've ever written up to this time.

30:11.574 --> 30:13.316
Maybe I'll write a better one.

30:13.336 --> 30:21.205
But if this doesn't work, then something has happened to the world, not to me.

30:21.805 --> 30:28.052
And I made a speech to that effect in the middle of all that depression.

30:28.589 --> 30:34.818
I was given an honorary degree by Russell Sage College.

30:34.838 --> 30:52.723
I wrote a speech in which I spoke about the stolen world, the world that I grew up in, a literary world that offered me extraordinary possibility coming into the world of

30:53.783 --> 31:03.634
Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe and Steinbeck and the world of Hemingway and so many other marvelous writers.

31:04.836 --> 31:20.213
The magazines were full of Bernard Malamud's short stories and I mean things like the Saturday Evening Post were publishing marvelously good writing.

31:21.307 --> 31:24.811
The Atlantic was publishing more and Harper's was publishing more.

31:24.831 --> 31:26.814
There were more magazines around it.

31:26.834 --> 31:33.422
And suddenly all that faded away and it became very much a subdued culture and subculture.

31:34.163 --> 31:42.132
And the world of big bucks began to move in on the publishing world.

31:42.293 --> 31:45.897
It's ebbing somewhat now, they say.

31:46.113 --> 31:46.674
That's right.

31:46.694 --> 31:50.197
They haven't made the kind of profits I think they want.

31:50.217 --> 32:07.216
It's an adage that you hear so often from publishers that a good book will always be published.

32:07.236 --> 32:08.097
Do you believe in that?

32:08.117 --> 32:15.765
Well, I believe that if something happened to me in the middle of all that trouble and

32:16.100 --> 32:20.165
If I had dropped dead one afternoon, I don't think Ironweed would have been published.

32:20.186 --> 32:27.696
I mean, maybe someday somebody would have come along and written some essays about Billy and Legs.

32:27.796 --> 32:28.336
I don't know.

32:28.497 --> 32:35.526
People are always writing about obscure writers, dredging them up and looking in the attic and the trunks.

32:35.586 --> 32:36.768
That's like a Pharisee.

32:37.208 --> 32:37.829
Right.

32:37.849 --> 32:39.271
Example thing.

32:39.912 --> 32:40.353
Yeah.

32:40.453 --> 32:44.318
Well, you don't know about the novels that

32:45.125 --> 32:46.747
molded away in the trunk.

32:48.930 --> 32:54.798
I had a student once who gave me a novel to read.

32:55.700 --> 33:01.267
And I read it and I thought, gee, this has got a lot of potential.

33:01.287 --> 33:03.310
It's a pretty interesting book.

33:03.330 --> 33:06.274
And the next class I came around, she died.

33:07.095 --> 33:10.900
She was in her late 60s or something, or middle 60s.

33:11.722 --> 33:14.946
And I didn't, or maybe I didn't know it right away.

33:15.753 --> 33:27.190
And so she'd been working on and off for a good many years of her life and it didn't come to pass.

33:27.651 --> 33:42.393
I think that's a comforting old wives tale that the publishing industry and certain arrogant writers would like to have us believe, but I don't believe that it's true.

33:42.794 --> 33:43.515
I believe that

33:45.352 --> 33:54.926
A great deal of bad luck goes without recognition.

33:56.067 --> 34:03.178
And the exceptions are not the rule by any means.

34:03.198 --> 34:07.043
You already had three novels behind you.

34:07.063 --> 34:08.305
Let's say I and we didn't.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.944
Oh, yeah.

34:12.385 --> 34:12.706
Sure.

34:13.286 --> 34:14.889
Oh, that wouldn't have stopped me.

34:14.909 --> 34:20.257
I mean, I felt that sooner or later I'd get it published somewhere, somehow.

34:20.317 --> 34:23.041
Maybe I'd have to write another book.

34:23.622 --> 34:35.980
But I have much too much invested in a life of writing to have them

34:36.837 --> 34:38.699
allowed that to stop me.

34:38.739 --> 34:40.181
I wouldn't know what else to do.

34:40.341 --> 34:41.602
You knew it was good.

34:42.443 --> 34:51.814
I felt it was good, and I had some very good readers around me, people at the university, some friends who were very enamored of it.

34:51.894 --> 35:02.946
And then people up at Cornell were publishing it piecemeal, and their response was extraordinarily supportive.

35:04.715 --> 35:30.231
I think the title, Ironweed, says a lot about the people you look to for inspiration, for good at them, and perhaps it is these same characters which might have lent it in reluctance on the part of publishing.

35:30.252 --> 35:32.455
Tell me something about these particular characters, the characters of Ironweed, to some extent relate.

35:32.475 --> 35:34.097
Not so much in the intro, which I'm halfway through, I just got my poop smutting.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.084
That is a decidedly non-Albany novel.

35:37.105 --> 35:41.132
I think it has been said that all your novels are set in Albany.

35:41.152 --> 35:42.795
Well, that's not entirely true.

35:43.216 --> 35:45.480
Although I haven't finished yet.

35:45.981 --> 35:55.738
You'll go back in time and there's a certain set of historical realities.

35:56.159 --> 35:56.480
Right.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.363
Temporary to the time it was written.

36:00.453 --> 36:09.785
But there's some history that's definitely Albany history, however nonspecific it is.

36:10.506 --> 36:19.778
I did put a little introduction, I don't know if that was in the galleys, just a paragraph stating that these,

36:20.703 --> 36:23.706
The dynamics are Albany dynamics.

36:23.726 --> 36:26.668
It's definitely... Well, it should be there.

36:26.708 --> 36:30.531
Maybe you just... It's only a paragraph in the front.

36:31.432 --> 36:36.296
But... This is something written for this particular work?

36:36.316 --> 36:38.498
Just for this edition.

36:38.578 --> 36:39.799
Otherwise, it's not changed.

36:40.079 --> 36:43.942
I mean, the design elements have changed, but that's about it.

36:47.185 --> 36:49.047
I'll show it to you.

36:49.067 --> 36:50.608
I'll get the intro and show you.

36:51.415 --> 37:09.800
Anyway, the... We're talking about the characters and... Which some people might call bums and lowlights and vagrants and down-and-out-ways, whatever.

37:09.820 --> 37:13.745
There's an old slate of descriptions that can apply to them again.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.307
Right.

37:15.327 --> 37:19.753
Well, I've talked about this to some degree.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.355
I have never...

37:22.398 --> 37:37.756
I don't think I've exhausted my attitude towards it, but one of the things I feel is that I'm dealing with extreme people for a reason.

37:38.057 --> 37:51.493
And I'm able to find in them the extreme conditions which illuminate that life far more

37:52.283 --> 38:18.173
effectively through this drama of ultimate destiny that we find in people who carry their lives on beyond the norm diamonds was certainly that kind of a character billy phelan

38:18.828 --> 38:43.587
in his kind of belief in his own set of moral principles, he discovers how very different he is from the rest of the people and what a different set of morality, or the morality of the politicians, how different it is from his own.

38:44.495 --> 39:13.303
Francis, of course, is probably the most extreme case, carries himself out of the family, out of his family, out of his own history, out of his own world, into this kind of vagrant life, and never quite understanding it, never able to accept it, and always trying to come back, and finally coming back.

39:15.157 --> 39:16.298
You see what I mean?

39:16.499 --> 39:23.347
The notion of extreme is very important to dramatizing anything, I believe.

39:23.367 --> 39:43.493
The tepid lives of the not very desperate masses are not the stuff of drama, as far as I'm concerned.

39:43.861 --> 40:08.075
You can get novels of manners, social custom and so on, a good many of the short story writers of the age are dealing with that sort of thing.

40:08.096 --> 40:11.961
But when you get to think about Chekhov,

40:17.847 --> 40:28.639
You know, you find lives carried to degrees that suddenly worlds are expanded.

40:28.659 --> 40:37.908
Are these people that you knew when you were writing?

40:37.928 --> 40:38.569
I can't tell you this in Albany.

40:38.589 --> 40:46.858
Some people are, you know, I grew up in this city and have seen a great many elements of its life.

40:47.395 --> 40:51.041
because I was a journalist.

40:51.062 --> 40:54.668
And I think that that served me extremely well.

40:54.768 --> 41:06.048
I never had a loss to what to write about next.

41:06.068 --> 41:10.416
The world of research that I did into Old Albany and the articles that

41:11.223 --> 41:40.032
prompted that book back in the 1960s when I worked on it just had given me a sense of history and a sense of the kind of characters who have done extraordinary things in the world not necessarily very well known people but Diamond was a celebrity Billy Phelan was an extreme character and

41:40.990 --> 41:51.568
He was patterned after an old uncle of mine, but my uncle didn't ever get into the situation that really Salem got into.

41:51.588 --> 42:00.182
But the quality of his life and his attitudes were to somewhat, to some degree, patterned after him.

42:00.202 --> 42:05.952
And he lived in that period, which I thought was a really extraordinary time.

42:06.438 --> 42:14.248
Well, you write quite a bit about that period, the 20s and 30s.

42:14.268 --> 42:15.449
Tell me about your fascination for that period.

42:15.469 --> 42:16.290
Is it a fascination?

42:16.650 --> 42:20.996
Now it seems you're going back in time, that century.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.698
Right.

42:23.779 --> 42:35.213
I feel that there's a city here that's laid bare.

42:35.581 --> 43:03.580
for me to just explore in every way I want to and 1849 was an arbitrary year nothing particular was happening that I wanted to deal with in that year but I wanted the children to be of an age so that I could I'm pegging things to

43:05.348 --> 43:17.905
come to climax in 20 years later, 25, 19, 18, whatever, years later, so I just picked 1849.

43:17.925 --> 43:21.469
Turns out to be a very fascinating year.

43:22.351 --> 43:26.716
The 30s?

43:26.777 --> 43:31.022
Well, I do feel like you're in a timewater person.

43:31.062 --> 43:34.647
No, I feel that I, you know, it's...

43:35.487 --> 43:36.749
It started with legs.

43:37.991 --> 43:48.509
I was going to write about the political machine, as I mentioned, and I had no particular reason to limit myself to the 30s.

43:48.749 --> 44:00.769
But I started to think about that kidnapping of Dan O'Connell's nephew, which is good background music for Billy Salen.

44:02.116 --> 44:10.445
And then I began to think about legs, and those were both centered in 1931, 33, 29, whatever.

44:10.465 --> 44:18.093
The kidnapping was 33, Diamond comes from 27 to 31 in Albany.

44:19.254 --> 44:29.625
So that period became important for that research, and when the research began to take me over, I thought, you know,

44:30.095 --> 44:40.009
I felt I knew a lot about the age, and I continued to feel immersed in it after I finished Legs, which is why I went on to do Billy.

44:42.193 --> 44:48.101
And Francis was a consequence of Billy, so it's sort of serendipity.

44:48.181 --> 44:51.286
He's a terrible character.

44:51.306 --> 44:53.509
Billy, but he was so strong to me.

44:54.711 --> 44:56.714
Which raises the father-son's theme.

44:56.794 --> 44:58.296
I mean, is this an actual...

45:00.385 --> 45:07.554
Is this something that you feel that you're exploring?

45:07.974 --> 45:11.218
Well, it certainly was pervasive in Billy.

45:11.258 --> 45:13.241
Every phase of Billy is that.

45:16.925 --> 45:23.473
In Ironweed, it's different.

45:24.247 --> 45:48.752
and he has a relationship with his mother and his father that's significant but who doesn't but that's not the emphasis of the book the book is basically a book of redemption and uh

45:49.357 --> 45:54.002
Well, Billy is a book of games, gameplay.

45:54.022 --> 46:00.169
And there's a major difference in that.

46:00.269 --> 46:13.845
Billy is pervaded by fathers and sons, and Francis' book is pervaded by this...
