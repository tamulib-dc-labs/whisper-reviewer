WEBVTT

00:03.912 --> 00:13.824
This is not the time I bless myself to people who don't come from around here.

00:13.844 --> 00:16.367
Well, actually, this is Greece.

00:16.688 --> 00:18.330
This is Greece.

00:18.430 --> 00:22.435
This is the peninsula of Chalcedis.

00:24.437 --> 00:30.004
And here, the third leg of this peninsula is Mount Athos.

00:30.541 --> 00:58.725
Mount Athos refers to the whole lake the whole peninsula actually the Mount Athos is this it's only this and that this is a huge rocky mountain 6,000 feet tall it's pretty tall pretty high but as a result of the presence of this mountain the whole peninsula is called the peninsula of Mount Athos okay this is what I do actually what I will do is this

00:59.077 --> 01:01.240
Start from Uranúpolis, that is right here.

01:02.642 --> 01:05.486
This is the imaginary boundaries of Mount Athos.

01:06.507 --> 01:10.312
Anything beyond this point is out of limits for women.

01:11.313 --> 01:16.941
And we start from Uranúpolis, go all the way down here to Daphne.

01:17.882 --> 01:22.468
Then we go, we take the bus from here, we go up to Cariès here.

01:23.090 --> 01:52.270
and from there we visit monasteries of this side actually Lavra, great Lavra that you have in mind is down here and I will explain how you'll be able to another monastery you want to see certainly is Eviron and that is within walking distance from Cariès Vatopedi is out of the way and I don't suggest going to Vatopedi because Vatopedi you have to double back to go to Vatopedi actually what is good for you is to go to Cariès

01:52.823 --> 01:57.430
See certain things that I will indicate to you tonight and then go to Stavronikita.

01:58.673 --> 02:00.516
You can do that on foot.

02:01.117 --> 02:03.140
It takes about 40 minutes downhill.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.083
That's first, right?

02:05.403 --> 02:06.065
I beg your pardon?

02:06.085 --> 02:07.086
You'd recommend I do that?

02:07.387 --> 02:18.645
Yes, on foot to get a sense of the land and the landscape and then go down to Iviron from Stavronikita to Iviron to get a ride.

02:20.853 --> 02:45.848
and if the weather is good spend the night at Iberon and if the weather is good and if boats are still running take a boat from Iberon right here and go all the way to Lavra if not try to get a ride to Lavra try to get so try to get a boat from Iberon to Lavra but I would suggest get a ride because you will see some

02:46.283 --> 02:57.080
amazing land, amazing terrain, a ride, a bus or a truck ride, no matter how much they charge you do it.

02:58.422 --> 02:59.784
Because that is unique.

02:59.884 --> 03:03.870
And if you go to Lavra, there is something else.

03:04.846 --> 03:05.687
So I would do that.

03:05.827 --> 03:07.048
Now you say how much they charge.

03:07.408 --> 03:09.731
Do they charge or do you give them something?

03:09.751 --> 03:12.433
No, no, they charge you because they are privateers.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.115
I mean, they're not, okay?

03:14.135 --> 03:28.609
But we'll get to that after we go through the... Well, until very recently, until what, 10, 15 years ago, everything, all communications now that was done on boats like this.

03:29.870 --> 03:34.414
This is a Trehandiri, that's what you call it, and this is actually

03:34.782 --> 03:41.609
the development of boat building in Mediterranean since prehistoric times.

03:41.829 --> 03:46.093
What makes that boat, what gives it its character?

03:46.173 --> 03:49.076
The fact that it is virtually unsinkable.

03:49.396 --> 03:54.622
It doesn't go down, provided that you have somebody that knows what he's doing, okay?

03:55.302 --> 03:56.964
This is a fisherman's boat.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.507
What are we, could you spell it for me?

04:00.588 --> 04:04.131
T-R-E-H-A

04:05.039 --> 04:10.067
T-R-E-H-A-N-T-I-R-Y.

04:10.087 --> 04:14.093
T-R-E-H-A-N-T-I-R-Y.

04:15.675 --> 04:18.960
I simply transliterate, that's all I do, it's Trefandir, okay?

04:19.761 --> 04:33.021
Now, of course, as the time went on, this changed, and of course now, faster, iron boats,

04:33.473 --> 04:40.042
taking the part of the boats I showed you before.

04:40.102 --> 04:50.195
They're faster, but they're less romantic, they're less traditional, and I prefer the old boats.

04:50.215 --> 04:51.276
However, you don't see them anymore.

04:51.296 --> 04:52.458
Is it faster and more reliable?

04:52.818 --> 04:53.259
Oh, yes.

04:53.379 --> 04:57.164
Well, reliable, again, only God knows what reliable is.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.068
And of course, all of them, they have names.

05:00.629 --> 05:02.451
This is Hagia Anna.

05:02.532 --> 05:13.547
This is a little... It's a location where Skites, small little houses where two or three monks lived together separately away from the big monasteries.

05:13.887 --> 05:14.088
Okay?

05:14.528 --> 05:15.289
There's a Skite.

05:16.171 --> 05:24.041
By the way, if you have an opportunity, look at the book you bought tonight.

05:25.323 --> 05:31.932
Now, we start going down the peninsula and then you see this...

05:32.418 --> 06:00.484
slope and you realize that is a result of some volcanic activities and of course such activities are recorded in Greek mythology where Mount Athos is supposed to be one of the giants that fought against the Olympian gods and in fact Mount Athos attempted to molest virgin Athena and Poseidon or Zeus

06:00.768 --> 06:08.998
depending upon the version of the story told, is a giant.

06:09.018 --> 06:15.266
It's what existed before the Olympian gods took over.

06:15.827 --> 06:24.177
And there Poseidon throws a huge rock on the top of the giant and the giant is killed and the name

06:24.443 --> 06:49.810
of the giant who was Athos is given to the mountain that was a pretty rock actually but that symbolizes volcanic activities in the area okay as we go downhill now this is what you see when you're on the boat oh yes this is all I will see this going on on the boat yes more or less more or less yeah because we're on our way now to

06:50.093 --> 06:50.954
On the way down.

06:53.817 --> 06:55.199
Well, look at this.

06:55.539 --> 06:57.622
That looks like Scandinavian little castle.

06:58.423 --> 06:58.903
But it's not.

06:59.344 --> 07:00.505
It's actually a house.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.647
That is a house.

07:03.649 --> 07:07.193
Monks got crowded even in huge monasteries.

07:07.633 --> 07:13.280
And some of them asking for, looking for seclusion, went and built their own little houses.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.841
These are called skites.

07:16.143 --> 07:18.025
And they are two or three.

07:18.308 --> 07:37.363
stay together and work together and pray together and die together in the end or well die separately yes they usually depend on a larger monastery they say this is a skiti of iberon this is skiti of lavora okay they usually sublet from the monastery

07:39.554 --> 07:41.757
But it's like the 50 states in the United States.

07:42.558 --> 07:44.300
The monastery is at 20.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.946
When they divide their state, there in Mount Athosar is different.

07:48.966 --> 07:49.427
Okay?

07:49.507 --> 07:51.689
Yeah, that is a good parallelism.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.692
You know, the United States and Mount Athosar.

07:53.712 --> 07:57.076
So this would be like Massachusetts, but maybe that's Boston right there.

07:57.116 --> 07:58.238
Well, not exactly.

07:58.278 --> 08:03.765
Actually, what this will be is a county.

08:04.145 --> 08:04.666
Okay.

08:04.686 --> 08:06.548
A county is a bigger larger than that.

08:06.568 --> 08:06.849
Okay.

08:08.411 --> 08:09.392
Now, as we...

08:09.963 --> 08:38.130
go on you see beautiful formations of water and of rock formations some of the cleanest water in Mediterranean and I can guarantee that it's clear under the water because I've been diving there for the past 30 years I ought to know and these are actually make some stops

08:38.380 --> 08:40.002
But this is a good example.

08:40.162 --> 08:41.985
This is the arsanas.

08:42.005 --> 08:44.488
What is an arsanas?

08:45.229 --> 08:50.717
Actually, the word comes from an arsenal.

08:52.379 --> 09:05.136
Originally, I checked Webster, it means a depot by the seafront where perishables are unloaded for the monastery.

09:05.156 --> 09:08.100
This is the arsanas of the Bulgarian monastery of Zodrappu.

09:08.418 --> 09:16.790
And the Bulgarians, being a land people, build a monastery, their monastery, in the mountains, away from the sea.

09:16.810 --> 09:19.073
Something that Byzantines don't do.

09:19.093 --> 09:30.789
All Byzantine monasteries of Mount Athos, all 17 of them, Greek monasteries, are built near to the sea, near the sea.

09:30.809 --> 09:32.391
Is there something symbolic in that?

09:32.451 --> 09:38.239
No, there were Greeks, they loved the sea, they knew how

09:39.063 --> 09:45.310
Well actually here you have a package of three entities in one.

09:45.330 --> 09:54.019
First of all we have the depot where the boats come and unload things and then monks take them into the monasteries and the backs of mules.

09:55.301 --> 10:06.673
The other thing is a chapel, mount that is full of them because there that reminds you that this is a place of prayer.

10:09.202 --> 10:37.133
chapel with crosses and that's incorporated into the structure and then you have a tower where is this it's a tower a watchtower it's a part of a greater network of early warning system against pirates if we place the beginning of Mount Athos somewhere in the seventh or eighth century that is something that is still disputed

10:39.374 --> 11:08.790
9th and 10th century, the late 9th and beginning of 10th century is the time of piracy because the Byzantines lose Crete in the middle of 9th century and the Arabs, the Saracen Arabs really take over

11:09.428 --> 11:13.633
And in the beginning of the 10th century they even sacked Thessaloniki.

11:13.653 --> 11:14.794
904.

11:15.094 --> 11:28.590
A man by the name of Leo of Tripolis comes and takes Thessaloniki and departs taking with him 22,000 young men and women.

11:29.771 --> 11:30.952
Okay, it's an amazing story.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.135
22,000 people.

11:33.756 --> 11:38.541
Many of them died on the way back and takes them down to Crete and to Egypt and sells them as slaves.

11:39.128 --> 11:43.372
Now, this is a warning tower, part of the warning system.

11:44.133 --> 12:01.171
The moment they saw something, they sent smoke signals or fire at mine or bells or horsemen alerted the area and then if they had time, they would flee.

12:01.572 --> 12:05.676
If they did not, they would lock the doors and this is a tower.

12:06.027 --> 12:13.475
And no self-respecting pirate would waste any time trying to kill four or five people in the tower.

12:13.495 --> 12:15.276
Because pirates had other things to do.

12:15.517 --> 12:22.043
They grab everything they can and they take off before the Byzantine fleet appeared.

12:22.063 --> 12:28.110
Well, the Byzantine fleet would appear only to verify the damages.

12:29.231 --> 12:34.296
It was always late because you realized how difficult it was to communicate.

12:36.925 --> 12:42.493
Now, this is a good example of Byzantine Monastery.

12:42.513 --> 12:58.374
Most of these are built in the 10th century in the form you see in there, but this is the Monastery of the Chiariu, as you will see tomorrow, and there are many things to be said.

12:59.656 --> 13:02.180
Well, let's jump one and then come back.

13:03.201 --> 13:03.962
We're talking about

13:04.448 --> 13:07.132
Huge walls, we're talking about fortifications, okay?

13:07.152 --> 13:07.733
You can see this.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.375
This is fortifications.

13:10.417 --> 13:14.002
No windows, no openings at the base, okay?

13:14.022 --> 13:15.605
Smaller, we go up.

13:15.625 --> 13:16.927
That's a seven-story building.

13:17.928 --> 13:18.890
That's impressive.

13:19.471 --> 13:23.637
Now, right in the middle there is a church that is called the Catholicon.

13:24.899 --> 13:26.781
And all around, there are huge walls.

13:27.162 --> 13:31.148
And at the end, one corner, there's a huge tower.

13:31.803 --> 13:37.910
that in this particular case was the last line of defense in case the pirates were able to scale the walls.

13:37.970 --> 13:39.111
Did they have weapons to fight?

13:39.672 --> 13:40.613
Oh, you bet.

13:40.633 --> 13:41.714
I mean the monks.

13:42.094 --> 13:42.735
Oh, definitely.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.236
So they fought.

13:43.636 --> 13:44.477
Oh, of course they did.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.478
They were passive.

13:45.538 --> 13:46.019
No, no, no, no.

13:46.039 --> 13:47.821
They fought, my friend, and they fought well.

13:47.861 --> 13:59.093
And especially we have, in fact, embattlements where one can see signs where the cannons were hinged.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.781
Okay, they had cannons there.

14:01.801 --> 14:03.003
So they were in an easy pushover.

14:03.023 --> 14:03.844
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:03.924 --> 14:07.950
They would fight and... The fact that it's there a thousand years comes to something, doesn't it?

14:07.970 --> 14:08.591
Definitely.

14:08.932 --> 14:09.773
But let's go back.

14:10.294 --> 14:13.960
Actually, wall all around.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.883
Wall all around.

14:15.903 --> 14:17.185
Is the chair comfortable?

14:17.405 --> 14:18.887
Yes, ma'am.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.351
Okay, I can bring something more comfortable if you like.

14:21.371 --> 14:21.612
Okay.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.456
Now, you see the...

14:25.432 --> 14:27.655
That's the main church of the monastery.

14:27.956 --> 14:30.620
The heart of their spiritual life.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.783
Oh definitely, you cannot miss.

14:33.203 --> 14:34.065
That is the case.

14:37.029 --> 14:41.415
And you see many testimonies indicating that there was no central heating system.

14:41.556 --> 14:43.579
Today they do have central heating systems.

14:44.220 --> 14:46.563
They work using wood.

14:47.925 --> 14:48.586
They burn wood.

14:49.107 --> 14:52.772
Because they're afraid they might burn again.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.522
And the funny thing, you see this?

14:57.364 --> 14:58.325
Rooms sticking out?

14:59.386 --> 14:59.606
Yes.

14:59.686 --> 15:02.008
Doesn't it remind you what we saw in the Saloniki yesterday?

15:02.609 --> 15:02.709
Yes.

15:02.729 --> 15:03.890
Well, it is a Turkish style.

15:04.931 --> 15:06.192
The Turks took it from the Persians.

15:06.412 --> 15:16.141
And this was built during periods where the increase of monks was so big that they could not shelter everybody in.

15:17.322 --> 15:22.827
And being afraid to stay outside the masteries, they expanded the only way possible.

15:25.186 --> 15:25.586
Okay?

15:26.127 --> 15:32.834
They built like nests, they were built and they were still under the protection of the monastery.

15:33.494 --> 15:41.642
Well, here some monk decided to do his own thing and paint his rooms the way he wanted.

15:42.843 --> 15:54.535
But that thing doesn't fold anymore because the monastery is all now, all monasteries now are koinobia which means under one man, under one abbot,

15:55.072 --> 16:01.574
common mess, common art of work, everything is common, okay?

16:01.615 --> 16:04.103
That's one of the primary forms of monasticism.

16:04.555 --> 16:19.095
For many years in Mount Athos various monasteries had other forms of self-government and some of them were ladre which means monks, they cook for themselves, they work for themselves and they only get together for prayer.

16:19.135 --> 16:25.424
But this system didn't seem to work and all monasteries today in Mount Athos are coinobia.

16:25.444 --> 16:25.664
Okay?

16:25.965 --> 16:26.566
All but one.

16:26.886 --> 16:31.953
Now, you see the wall that surrounds the monastery?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.415
This is their world.

16:34.340 --> 17:03.958
Okay, they consider this to be their microcosm and the church inside the Katholikon is to them like Noah's Ark and this is why before every service you will hear it the monks hold a big wooden piece that looks like an ore

17:04.310 --> 17:05.051
And they hit on it.

17:06.313 --> 17:10.198
It's a very characteristic noise.

17:11.400 --> 17:17.689
Resembling the call that Noé made so the animals would enter the ark.

17:18.450 --> 17:25.319
In a metaphoric sense, calling the monks to get into the Catholicon and be saved.

17:25.339 --> 17:33.591
If you see that, you know what happened.

17:33.790 --> 17:38.618
We come now to the Russian monastery, of course.

17:38.638 --> 17:39.419
I beg your pardon?

17:39.439 --> 17:40.100
It looks Russian.

17:40.120 --> 17:40.761
Oh, yes, it does.

17:42.264 --> 17:54.343
Yes, sir.

18:00.914 --> 18:01.114
Thank you.

18:01.415 --> 18:08.403
This is the Russian Monastery because you see the inverted onion domes.

18:11.827 --> 18:13.248
This is new.

18:16.872 --> 18:18.154
Actually, this is what?

18:18.214 --> 18:19.055
This is modern.

18:19.835 --> 18:20.576
Modern is what?

18:21.337 --> 18:29.346
This is the 17, 18-century statue and expresses the desire

18:30.338 --> 18:45.514
of the law of all Russia, especially Catherine the Great, to come down to Mediterranean.

18:45.534 --> 18:45.634
Okay?

18:46.255 --> 18:50.399
Huge structure, number 2,000 monks.

18:50.419 --> 18:50.599
Wow.

18:50.719 --> 18:51.280
There now?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.702
No, no, in their prime time.

18:54.483 --> 18:58.067
And it's very difficult to tell how many of them were really monks.

18:58.604 --> 19:25.405
Now

19:30.515 --> 19:41.732
This is aerial photography showing the monastery, the Russian monastery, from above.

19:43.295 --> 19:54.492
This is the man-made little harbor, and this is a huge dormitory that was destroyed by fire.

19:55.513 --> 19:59.239
Now, of course, all these things are restored, but Greek government has a problem.

19:59.877 --> 20:27.792
because it does not want to allow too many Russians to come in does not want to allow too many Bulgarians to come in or too many Serbians to come in by the way I read something about the Serbs Yes, that's precisely what I was going to tell you and it's very difficult you know Karadzic wanted to go there the monastery and then there was a reaction from the Greek government by the Greek government now then

20:29.847 --> 20:31.930
This is, let's go to the next.

20:33.652 --> 20:34.293
This is Daphne.

20:35.755 --> 20:40.161
This is the only legal port of entrance into Mount Athos.

20:40.201 --> 20:42.063
What is this thing over here?

20:42.324 --> 20:42.564
Daphne.

20:45.969 --> 20:46.669
And this is what it is.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.794
Actually, this is where you will stop, right there.

20:53.278 --> 20:58.285
This is where you will stop.

20:59.497 --> 21:04.142
And this is the bus you have to rush to and stand in line next to the door.

21:04.943 --> 21:05.223
Okay?

21:05.583 --> 21:07.325
Because too many people want to get in the bus.

21:08.406 --> 21:08.866
You miss it?

21:09.087 --> 21:16.614
Yes, you want to get on the bus because it's 50 minutes up the mountain to Karyas.

21:17.535 --> 21:19.858
And if you miss the bus, don't attempt to walk it.

21:20.638 --> 21:21.599
It's 5-6 hours.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.261
So how many buses?

21:23.301 --> 21:23.742
Just one?

21:23.962 --> 21:24.222
One.

21:24.455 --> 21:28.439
But does everybody get on?

21:28.479 --> 21:29.821
We hope.

21:30.061 --> 21:39.230
Well, this is the police building, this is something that has the audacity to call itself restaurant.

21:44.516 --> 21:47.299
After all, a few days will pass.

21:47.759 --> 21:53.145
Yes, it's what they give you and be a good man and everything is going to be.

21:53.395 --> 22:16.332
this is where you stop and this is what we saw in the in the previous photograph and this is the area of Daphne now you take a bus and you start going up the mountain as you will see this is what you see when you approach people are waiting to be checked by

22:17.408 --> 22:41.948
the police to get out they search you when you get out because they're afraid you might steal something and they have a reason to be afraid every now and then at Sotheby's and Tiffany's they sell things from Mount Athos okay people go there and steal but yeah so this is our athlete taking the bus yes

22:42.333 --> 22:43.314
No, no, no.

22:43.735 --> 22:45.698
We're still at Daphne.

22:45.738 --> 22:46.539
We're still on the boat.

22:46.999 --> 22:50.304
I thought you got on the bus after you got off the boat.

22:50.384 --> 22:50.624
Yes.

22:51.265 --> 22:54.930
But see, this is a slide that we're still on the boat.

22:54.970 --> 22:56.052
We're still getting off.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.874
Okay, so we haven't come to the bus yet.

22:58.015 --> 22:58.896
No, no.

22:59.076 --> 22:59.817
You're still on the boat.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.640
Perhaps it would be as big as this.

23:02.100 --> 23:02.681
This is a ferry.

23:03.642 --> 23:03.983
Okay?

23:04.323 --> 23:10.011
You get out and then you see these people standing there to be checked and the bus is right here.

23:10.615 --> 23:39.508
okay the moment you walk out these are stores that sell the things that you want to take back to your friends to the way out yeah on the way out yes and the bus is right here this is a police car and then we come to the bus this is the bus this is the bus you see the exhaust is up here to make sure that the

23:40.535 --> 24:02.323
sparks that come out don't start a fire there they put the luggage of people if you have anything heavy travel light take very few that's it don't give it step up okay what i have is one bag that's it

24:02.506 --> 24:07.250
I've got four pairs of underwear, four shirts, four pairs of socks, a toothbrush, a razor.

24:07.350 --> 24:08.131
That's it.

24:08.151 --> 24:09.793
That's it.

24:09.953 --> 24:10.894
That's it.

24:12.415 --> 24:18.801
Now, on the way up, because up the mountain, you see some amazing scenery.

24:20.002 --> 24:27.269
See how steep the coastline is and then you realize why the monks chose it.

24:27.289 --> 24:30.572
Because they want to

24:31.075 --> 24:33.458
Make sure that nobody bothers them.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.482
Seclusion is the key word, okay?

24:37.404 --> 24:44.954
And this is indeed the last refuge, the last unpolluted area in Mediterranean.

24:45.875 --> 24:46.476
I don't say so.

24:47.978 --> 24:50.161
The American satellites say so.

24:57.531 --> 24:58.352
There's a mountain.

24:59.033 --> 24:59.995
That's Atlas?

25:00.015 --> 25:00.255
Yes.

25:00.809 --> 25:02.971
It is huge.

25:04.012 --> 25:05.013
You took all these pictures?

25:05.093 --> 25:05.333
Yes.

25:09.456 --> 25:12.179
Look at all the trees.

25:12.399 --> 25:14.781
Look at this.

25:14.801 --> 25:22.848
This is how they forest, they cut down trees and forest trees.

25:22.868 --> 25:23.689
What kind of trees?

25:24.690 --> 25:29.514
Oak, basically.

25:29.534 --> 25:29.854
Hide wood trees?

25:30.745 --> 25:32.507
Look how beautiful it is, huh?

25:32.527 --> 25:32.607
Yep.

25:33.268 --> 25:34.689
Mountain, snow.

25:35.930 --> 25:36.331
It's amazing.

25:38.713 --> 25:43.819
Well, from time to time, you know, the bus goes and I take photographs.

25:43.839 --> 25:44.039
Yes.

25:44.800 --> 25:49.304
And this is very, it struck me as very unusual.

25:49.985 --> 25:50.746
This is granite.

25:52.187 --> 25:53.309
The hardest thing there is.

25:54.089 --> 26:00.516
And they shaped it into steps with chisel and hammer.

26:01.289 --> 26:07.097
And this is miles to make access from one monastery to the other easy.

26:07.697 --> 26:14.246
So I thought perhaps our faith is not enough to move mountains anymore.

26:14.967 --> 26:19.173
But plenty of it to make, to shape them.

26:19.854 --> 26:22.277
And it was monks that built all these monasteries?

26:22.898 --> 26:22.978
Yes.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.059
No, not actually.

26:25.020 --> 26:27.864
Most of these monasteries were built to the help of the empire.

26:27.924 --> 26:30.047
Expert.

26:30.635 --> 26:32.657
Architects.

26:32.677 --> 26:33.818
Architects.

26:33.878 --> 26:35.340
How about the workers?

26:35.560 --> 26:40.125
Oh, well, various ways to attract workers in medieval times.

26:41.947 --> 26:42.147
Slaves?

26:42.388 --> 26:47.113
No, because slaves have a problem.

26:47.713 --> 26:50.636
You need to watch over them.

26:50.656 --> 26:55.201
And slaves don't usually produce the results you like.

26:55.842 --> 26:58.785
There were no war prisoners either because that's the same problem.

26:59.086 --> 27:01.830
How can one motivate?

27:01.890 --> 27:12.604
Well, there's a way to motivate, but again it seems that most of these were built as a result of free will and money.

27:13.825 --> 27:25.060
And money was plenty of because the emperors considered themselves obligated to donate to a monastery because they were very much concerned for afterlife.

27:25.816 --> 27:30.802
And they thought this is a way to... So they had the full support of the modding of the powers?

27:30.822 --> 27:31.563
Oh, definitely.

27:31.583 --> 27:35.788
I mean, it was a totally Christian stage.

27:35.808 --> 27:39.953
Well, the flora is also amazing there.

27:40.353 --> 27:42.596
Will I see any this time in here?

27:42.656 --> 27:45.800
Yes, you will, because the climate is very mild.

27:47.141 --> 27:52.848
It's full of lemon trees and orange trees and amazing.

27:52.888 --> 27:55.131
Gardenians, camellias, it's an amazing place.

27:55.482 --> 27:58.365
And, well, they haven't used pesticides.

27:59.827 --> 28:01.148
They haven't used fertilizers.

28:01.508 --> 28:02.910
No pesticides or fertilizers.

28:03.310 --> 28:06.974
And no wonder the flora is amazing.

28:06.994 --> 28:20.609
In fact, now they made studies and they discovered that many hundreds of plants that are extinct in all the rest of Europe still exist in Mount Athos.

28:20.689 --> 28:24.493
And Mount Athos is protected by various agreements and so on.

28:25.148 --> 28:30.093
Okay, now this is Carrier.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.036
This is the administrative center of Mount Athos.

28:33.056 --> 28:54.818
Actually there are 20 monasteries and they send one representative every year and they all gather there and they convene in this building here, modern building and they decide

28:55.608 --> 28:57.831
for the affairs, for their affairs.

28:57.891 --> 29:02.538
This is a semi-autonomous system.

29:02.999 --> 29:07.205
They can do anything they like in Mount Athos.

29:07.846 --> 29:16.019
Mount Athos actually enjoys a different status from all other provinces in Greece.

29:17.281 --> 29:18.923
They don't vote.

29:18.943 --> 29:19.864
They don't pay taxes.

29:20.846 --> 29:24.872
And they can, if they feel that are not

29:25.460 --> 29:31.488
treated well by the Greek government, they can go to the United Nations and so on, okay?

29:31.508 --> 29:32.149
They can.

29:32.269 --> 29:33.351
Yes, they have different status.

29:33.711 --> 29:39.399
In the UK, the European community also respects that status.

29:40.621 --> 29:49.413
Okay, they allow them to maintain their way of life.

29:49.433 --> 29:54.420
No women allowed, no visitors allowed unless they are approved and so on.

29:54.805 --> 30:10.821
What is really important, of course, there is a Greek administrative official who attempts to allow the world to manipulate things, and very often he does.

30:10.841 --> 30:16.267
However, monks are famous in withstanding political manipulation.

30:16.307 --> 30:21.252
After all, Church has a huge 2,000 years experience in doing so.

30:21.923 --> 30:26.530
And there's no wonder that they were able to survive the Turkish occupation.

30:26.630 --> 30:34.742
Okay, the various firmaments from the Muslim, from the Ottoman sultans, that gives them privileges.

30:35.202 --> 30:39.108
It's amazing how they can single things there.

30:39.949 --> 30:41.712
But this is of the record now.

30:41.732 --> 30:45.678
This is what you really want to see if you go to Kariyes.

30:45.698 --> 30:50.665
When you go to Kariyes, this is an 11th century Trial Basilica.

30:51.708 --> 30:57.875
And that was once again painted with frescoes in the 14th century.

30:58.836 --> 31:00.198
But we'll get into that basilica.

31:00.838 --> 31:03.261
See, this is called Protaton.

31:03.842 --> 31:12.712
Protaton means where the Protos, the primus inter pares, goes to church.

31:12.732 --> 31:18.458
The Protos is the man who was elected to run the 29th council.

31:18.927 --> 31:19.868
He's the main man.

31:20.128 --> 31:20.549
Okay.

31:20.969 --> 31:22.972
The top dog, right?

31:22.992 --> 31:25.014
And how long does he hold that position?

31:25.335 --> 31:25.555
Year.

31:26.216 --> 31:26.636
One year?

31:26.656 --> 31:26.896
Yes.

31:27.077 --> 31:27.938
This is the Protaton.

31:28.178 --> 31:28.538
Okay?

31:28.558 --> 31:32.343
So, where's the degree of democracy, though?

31:34.005 --> 31:34.225
Oh, yes.

31:34.245 --> 31:35.787
This is the Protaton.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.912
What do you spell it?

31:40.172 --> 31:40.973
Protaton.

31:40.993 --> 31:41.994
P-R-O-T-A-T-O-N.

31:42.174 --> 31:42.395
Pro-ta-ton.

31:42.415 --> 31:42.995
He's the hare abbot.

31:43.936 --> 31:44.857
That's the Protos.

31:44.897 --> 31:45.618
Protaton is the church.

31:46.459 --> 31:48.782
Protos is the hare abbot.

31:50.686 --> 32:19.984
the climate there is very moist heavy as we call it and this is in august that's very still they use mules but again now you see many four by fours around okay jeeps run by the monks yes and this is the protatum

32:20.909 --> 32:25.173
Well, if you go in, this is, as you enter, on the top is this fresco.

32:25.674 --> 32:27.215
This is the mascot.

32:27.595 --> 32:29.037
You can recognize that.

32:29.057 --> 32:30.739
This is the reclining Christ.

32:31.379 --> 32:33.761
By the way, a few words about the Byzantine painting.

32:33.882 --> 32:41.769
A painter actually paints the existing doctrine.

32:41.789 --> 32:43.251
He doesn't do anything he likes.

32:43.691 --> 32:50.798
He paints what the church, he preaches through, with his brush.

32:54.423 --> 32:55.505
He doesn't improvise.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.266
No, no, no, no.

32:57.027 --> 33:00.332
There are precisely things.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.954
He does precisely.

33:02.235 --> 33:11.408
Some precise things.

33:13.431 --> 33:18.078
Is it better this way?

33:19.360 --> 33:22.905
It doesn't matter.

33:23.526 --> 33:23.586
OK.

33:23.836 --> 33:31.505
Now, this is the reclining Christ, okay?

33:31.725 --> 33:36.091
They take this from the Old Testament for the New Testament.

33:36.972 --> 33:46.043
Now, if you go in, this is the main aisle, as you will see, to the left and the right, there are three geographical zones.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.966
One, this is the evangelist, as you will see.

33:49.165 --> 34:13.738
This is seen from the New Testament, this is the descent of Christ into Hades after his resurrection and liberates Adam and Eve while Saint John the Baptist who has miraculously reacquired his head is standing watching the whole process because there was a problem you realize for early Christians what happened to those righteous men who died before?

34:13.972 --> 34:15.814
the coming of Christ, where do they go?

34:15.834 --> 34:30.988
So Christ goes down, breaks down the walls of Hades and liberates everybody while kings, queens and other people waiting for their turn to be lifted along with Christ.

34:33.070 --> 34:36.594
No, no, no, that's Catholic tradition.

34:36.614 --> 34:43.000
Here's another story told, Byzantines tell stories in a film-strip fashion.

34:44.127 --> 34:45.389
Narrative.

34:45.429 --> 34:47.632
That's right, precisely.

34:47.753 --> 34:58.809
And it's called by historians, by art historians, these paintings are called, the frescoes are called, they are called the Illiterate Man's Bible.

35:00.252 --> 35:00.772
Illiterate.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.435
Illiterate.

35:02.455 --> 35:03.436
Illiterate.

35:03.456 --> 35:04.458
Those who cannot.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.361
Illiterate Man's Bible.

35:07.342 --> 35:08.965
Actually, what they did was this.

35:08.985 --> 35:13.071
They used sound and picture

35:13.490 --> 35:18.156
to impress upon the faithful the Word of God.

35:19.057 --> 35:29.070
And since picture was scarce, you realize that what they saw here was printed on their mind forever.

35:30.231 --> 35:30.992
What happens here?

35:31.113 --> 35:33.095
Here is Christ, bigger than life.

35:33.716 --> 35:34.197
You see him?

35:36.299 --> 35:38.502
Listening to the preaching of Saint John the Baptist.

35:39.747 --> 35:47.816
One among the crowd, the Byzantine artist paints him a little bigger because he's a central, I think, IPKO.

35:48.977 --> 35:50.639
Yes.

35:50.739 --> 35:53.382
Obviously, they allow him to take photographs.

35:53.422 --> 35:57.026
Wow, that's not easy.

35:57.046 --> 36:00.330
Now, then you have this composition here.

36:01.672 --> 36:02.633
Let's see what this is.

36:03.414 --> 36:09.180
This is the moment that Christ is baptized.

36:10.426 --> 36:14.211
He is God and He is not submerged.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.357
He stands on the top of the water.

36:19.098 --> 36:24.325
He is one of the few simultaneous presentations of the three entities of Holy Trinity.

36:25.206 --> 36:35.961
Christ, the Son, the Holy Spirit as a dog and the voice of the Father

36:36.278 --> 36:38.741
that cannot be depicted in this picture.

36:38.762 --> 36:41.485
Well, it's depicted as a hand blessing from above.

36:41.946 --> 36:42.607
Okay?

36:42.627 --> 36:45.251
There's a rare presentation of three angels of Holy Trinity.

36:45.271 --> 36:51.740
Now, angels in a position of reverence witness the miracle.

36:51.760 --> 37:00.953
While the sea is amazed and rides away on a sea monster, so does Jordan River

37:01.962 --> 37:31.345
presented as an old man according to the classical tradition rides away on a pair of dolphins well actually according to the script the waters of Jordan River turn the other way around and start going up the mountain when Christ stepped into the river on the river okay and the amazement of this moment is depicted thus well this is another famous scene

37:33.012 --> 37:53.835
Christ is humiliated before Pontius Pilate, who is washing his hands, surrounded by soldiers in an official Roman building inside the city, surrounded by his accusers, and he's standing prisoner.

37:55.837 --> 37:58.480
The central figure is Pontius Pilate.

37:59.561 --> 38:01.483
If he steps up, he will be up to here.

38:04.737 --> 38:20.351
14th century, painted good samples of Macedonian oil, painted by a legendary person whose name is Panselinos.

38:20.371 --> 38:20.951
Panselinos.

38:21.492 --> 38:22.693
That means Furbun.

38:22.713 --> 38:24.374
Panselinos, P-A-N.

38:24.654 --> 38:33.242
P-A-N, Selinos, S-E-L-I-N-O-S.

38:33.526 --> 38:52.892
Yes, we're still in Protato.

38:54.354 --> 38:58.500
Yes, this is a portrait of a king, of an emperor.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.103
When I say king in Byzantine times, you mean an emperor.

39:04.627 --> 39:05.508
As 14th century.

39:09.414 --> 39:13.681
This is Ephraim the Syrian, a Syrian monk.

39:13.701 --> 39:17.186
No wonder he is so austere looking.

39:19.069 --> 39:23.816
This is Cyril of Alexandria, Bishop of Alexandria.

39:24.417 --> 39:29.344
We can tell that by the cover of his head.

39:31.267 --> 39:31.748
By the way.

39:32.082 --> 39:34.204
The hat he wears, the culvert.

39:34.404 --> 39:36.566
But that makes him a specific person?

39:36.587 --> 39:39.229
Yes, because bishops don't wear things like this.

39:39.890 --> 39:41.531
He's a known person.

39:41.612 --> 39:42.052
We know him.

39:42.092 --> 39:45.155
Historically, he did exist.

39:45.175 --> 39:46.256
He's Cyril of Alexandria.

39:46.516 --> 39:47.437
Bishop of Alexandria.

39:47.998 --> 39:48.979
His name is Cyril.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.300
We know that.

39:51.021 --> 39:54.304
And he always wears this funny hood on his head.

39:55.445 --> 39:57.027
This is a military saint.

40:01.563 --> 40:05.668
And last, but not least, of course, is Christ here.

40:06.709 --> 40:12.456
Look at the rosy cheek, cheeks of Christ, and he's full of life.

40:13.597 --> 40:17.242
He's optimistic.

40:18.003 --> 40:19.044
He's very optimistic here.

40:19.565 --> 40:23.049
You will see different versions after the fall of Constantinople.

40:23.069 --> 40:26.693
16th century Christ is totally different than this gentleman.

40:27.702 --> 40:30.646
14, 14.

40:30.947 --> 40:31.888
Macedonian school.

40:37.055 --> 40:38.076
Look at the colors, huh?

40:38.097 --> 40:38.657
Still surviving.

40:41.341 --> 40:48.751
And last but not least, I think this can hold its own next to any Renaissance paintings.

40:48.771 --> 40:49.252
St.

40:49.412 --> 40:50.173
John the Baptist.

40:50.454 --> 40:56.342
The man that he would feast on...

40:56.963 --> 40:59.325
wild honey and locusts.

40:59.345 --> 41:00.566
And do you know who did this?

41:00.586 --> 41:01.627
Panselinos.

41:02.328 --> 41:04.710
All of this is by one man named Panselinos.

41:04.810 --> 41:08.573
Did you compare this as a Greek version of the Sistine Chapel in a way?

41:09.074 --> 41:11.816
Well, no, because... Yes.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.139
Is it the same scope and the same pattern?

41:14.459 --> 41:19.343
No, that they express different things, but again, they aim at the same result.

41:19.924 --> 41:25.789
They want to impress positively those who enter the chapel.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.457
Okay?

41:27.977 --> 41:29.039
They want to educate.

41:29.840 --> 41:30.461
This is what it is.

41:31.562 --> 41:35.507
Yes, precisely.

41:35.527 --> 41:38.491
Now, this is a 16th century monastery.

41:39.092 --> 41:41.315
It's called Stavronikita and I want you to go there.

41:41.335 --> 41:45.841
16th century Stavronikita.

41:49.026 --> 41:52.811
This is a post-Byzantine monastery, 16th century.

41:52.891 --> 41:54.493
Anything after 1453

41:54.693 --> 41:56.255
It's post-Byzantine, okay?

41:57.016 --> 42:04.244
Anything after 1453, the fall of Constantinople, is called post-Byzantine.

42:04.264 --> 42:06.867
And this is a post-Byzantine monastery.

42:07.648 --> 42:09.850
And it's important for me to listen to it.

42:09.870 --> 42:09.950
Why?

42:09.970 --> 42:10.211
Explain.

42:10.231 --> 42:11.012
I beg your pardon?

42:11.032 --> 42:15.657
And why is it important for me to listen to this one?

42:15.717 --> 42:17.479
You will see as we go on.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.161
I will explain as we go on.

42:19.201 --> 42:21.424
Look at these huge, massive walls.

42:22.084 --> 42:23.346
Here they have gardens.

42:23.626 --> 42:24.447
See the gardens?

42:24.950 --> 42:54.315
cultivate gardens, truffles all over the place the catholicon is right in the middle and you cannot see it and of course the huge tower like any other monastery has this tower this is what it looks like from the air these are copies from somebody else's work now they restore the tower because in 1953 these are old photographs

42:54.751 --> 42:57.837
This is the aqueduct running water into the monastery.

42:58.459 --> 42:59.380
Is it still running water?

42:59.400 --> 42:59.701
Oh, yes.

43:01.144 --> 43:08.719
And if we go and see the scale... Wow!

43:09.401 --> 43:12.507
You see how small men are?

43:13.950 --> 43:16.114
You have your perspective.

43:16.134 --> 43:16.455
Yes.

43:17.903 --> 43:24.973
And these are the windows and these are the VIP rooms where me and my friends stay when I go there.

43:25.193 --> 43:31.662
And you can hear the nightingales and the waves play all night.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.445
It's an amazing thing.

43:33.465 --> 43:34.766
Should I try and spend the night?

43:34.786 --> 43:37.330
Yes, no, I would say spend the night at Iveron.

43:37.350 --> 43:40.274
I will tell you all this.

43:40.574 --> 43:44.620
Yes, I will.

43:44.903 --> 43:45.924
Aquaduct.

43:45.944 --> 43:46.545
Aquaduct.

43:48.368 --> 43:49.429
You see it?

43:49.990 --> 43:50.731
See the aquaduct?

43:51.973 --> 44:04.029
And this is the reflection of the aquaduct into the... Oh, I had plenty of equipment.

44:04.049 --> 44:06.493
Now, this is why you should visit this monastery.

44:07.835 --> 44:10.819
This is the best samples of post-Byzantine art.

44:10.839 --> 44:11.360
Look at Christ.

44:12.521 --> 44:13.122
Fascimistic.

44:15.835 --> 44:17.718
Their world has collapsed.

44:19.721 --> 44:25.350
This is very important to me.

44:25.451 --> 44:26.672
You can see it in the art.

44:29.737 --> 44:32.582
They are pessimistic about the world?

44:32.762 --> 44:36.809
Because their world has collapsed.

44:36.849 --> 44:42.518
Their empire, which they consider the center of the world, no longer exists.

44:43.072 --> 44:47.298
Byzantine, pious Byzantines cannot understand why God has punished them that way.

44:49.362 --> 44:52.646
So this reflects itself in the art, in the art.

44:53.147 --> 44:58.415
Yeah, I mean it's obvious if we put them together you can see those two things.

45:01.720 --> 45:10.193
Right there however you see you see a Panagia, a Virgin Mary

45:11.152 --> 45:41.091
definitely made by different artists and in fact inferior artists this is 18 probably 19th century and this is 16th century what happened actually the uh the abbot at some moment in the 19th century or late 18th century decided to redecorate plastered over plastered over and in the process saved what was underneath as a result of the earthquake

45:41.763 --> 45:50.273
we realized that something was underneath and they cleaned the whole works so this price had been covered?

45:50.473 --> 46:02.427
yes by this inferior art and they cleaned the top layer and voila some of the base work so why did they leave the layer again?

46:03.808 --> 46:07.112
this was for example

46:07.430 --> 46:12.937
So they can show... Yes, now... If this were a manuscript, we'd call this a palimpsest.

46:13.377 --> 46:15.400
Palimpsest, yes, yes, precisely.

46:15.821 --> 46:17.342
But there is a difference.

46:17.403 --> 46:24.471
Pseos, in many, I scratch and... Erase.

46:25.553 --> 46:27.595
And there was no other way to erase that.

46:27.635 --> 46:31.620
They took a knife or a pen and they scratch it.

46:33.102 --> 46:34.904
And then they rewrite on the top.

46:34.924 --> 46:35.585
But they do not.

46:35.826 --> 46:36.947
They simply cover...

46:37.855 --> 46:40.058
And they plaster over and they paint.

46:40.198 --> 46:44.984
And this is how we can take off the top layer.

46:45.825 --> 46:49.470
I don't think the Christians would destroy things like this.

46:50.311 --> 46:51.052
Okay?

46:51.072 --> 46:54.796
Now, as you enter the monastery, you will see Christ, St.

46:54.816 --> 46:57.199
Nicholas, and I doubt very much that you see this Virgin Mary.

46:57.940 --> 47:00.964
I photographed this as an example of what I'm talking about.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.927
I don't think this exists anymore.

47:03.748 --> 47:07.272
As you enter the church, actually, this is a cliché.

47:07.640 --> 47:14.910
Christ, Virgin Mary, and the patron saint of the church to whose name the church is dedicated.

47:15.892 --> 47:18.055
All churches are dedicated to somebody, okay?

47:18.135 --> 47:18.636
St.

47:18.656 --> 47:18.936
Nicholas.

47:20.178 --> 47:21.640
So I should definitely visit that.

47:21.660 --> 47:22.101
That's right.

47:23.443 --> 47:24.344
Look.

47:24.364 --> 47:26.827
That's it, yeah, that's wonderful, isn't it?

47:26.847 --> 47:33.116
Okay, and if you compare that to the 14th century Christ, you realize that something has happened in between.

47:33.177 --> 47:37.022
Eviron built at sea level,

47:39.078 --> 48:07.802
and this is a huge structure because most of the other monasteries are built on a rock for fortification purposes okay for defense purposes they are built at sea level but you see the huge walls they have and chapels incorporated in these walls this is the monastery

48:09.402 --> 48:14.229
This is a door into which they pull the boats during winter time because the weather gets rough.

48:15.391 --> 48:19.176
You see the small little chapels.

48:20.198 --> 48:20.778
Huge complex.

48:23.482 --> 48:26.527
How many people altogether on the mountain now?

48:26.547 --> 48:27.208
About 2,000.

48:27.388 --> 48:27.809
2,000?

48:28.029 --> 48:28.229
Yes.

48:28.690 --> 48:31.254
And its height it was how many people?

48:31.274 --> 48:31.814
Oh, many.

48:32.235 --> 48:36.201
2,000 were only at the Russian Monastery.

48:36.441 --> 48:38.464
But there was a decline.

48:39.625 --> 48:43.771
But it came pretty close in wiping out the population.

48:44.111 --> 48:45.172
That was this century?

48:45.232 --> 48:45.913
Yes, 1950.

48:46.034 --> 48:48.577
Really, that recent?

48:48.657 --> 48:50.940
And then it swung the other way around.

48:51.060 --> 48:53.484
What do they attribute that to?

48:53.504 --> 49:06.421
Sociologists say that there was, after war, there was a, in the 50s, that's the beginning of the modern times and total disorientation.

49:06.441 --> 49:08.063
And people are looking for

49:09.022 --> 49:36.683
points steady points of reference and this is why people go there now as you see boats don't always run on time people this is how you wait for the boat to leave yes to get out yeah i have to get out on wednesday don't worry about it i'm only joking the day you will get out on time no don't worry about it

49:37.422 --> 49:42.248
You will speak to people, they speak English, they will explain and they are pretty reliable.

49:43.009 --> 49:56.065
The only element that can really mess things up is the weather and that is why if you go to Lavra, make sure you don't rely on a boat to get out but on land transportation.

49:56.406 --> 50:02.093
It's couple hours on a 4x4 and you suffer but it's well worth it.

50:02.614 --> 50:02.974
Okay?

50:03.359 --> 50:05.081
I'll do lava early, if I stay.

50:05.362 --> 50:06.102
Not at the end.

50:06.143 --> 50:06.543
No, no, no.

50:06.683 --> 50:07.945
I'll tell you how this will work.

50:09.146 --> 50:10.548
At the end of... Now.

50:11.629 --> 50:15.795
This is a small man-made harbor.

50:17.637 --> 50:19.359
And this photo was taken 20 years ago.

50:19.519 --> 50:22.724
20, perhaps 25 years ago.

50:22.744 --> 50:22.944
In 71.

50:22.964 --> 50:23.064
72.

50:23.084 --> 50:25.908
27 years ago.

50:25.968 --> 50:27.129
Okay.

50:27.149 --> 50:27.329
Yep.

50:27.670 --> 50:28.271
When I was young.

50:28.571 --> 50:28.771
Now.

50:30.333 --> 50:32.556
This is what the monastery looks like.

50:33.633 --> 50:37.880
It's the greatest, the biggest, built officially in 963.

50:38.962 --> 50:39.863
Noble?

50:42.187 --> 50:42.428
Yes.

50:45.533 --> 50:51.643
With the donations of two great emperors, Nysephras Fokas and John Tsimiskis.

50:54.248 --> 50:59.877
This man is no longer alive, but he brought me into a...

51:00.970 --> 51:05.594
a point higher above, and proudly shows me his monastery.

51:06.455 --> 51:14.923
These are the walls, fully fortified with military towers, like the ones you see at the Walls of Thessaloniki.

51:15.944 --> 51:16.145
Okay?

51:17.266 --> 51:24.212
This is a tower attributed to Ioannis Tsimiskis, but it's only a legend.

51:24.232 --> 51:25.734
This is built later.

51:26.515 --> 51:29.037
And here is the Catholicon of the monastery.

51:29.337 --> 51:34.462
that we will visit as we go along.

51:34.743 --> 51:36.304
It's a huge complex.

51:36.324 --> 51:45.614
It's the biggest, earliest and number one in the list of presentation of monasteries.

51:45.634 --> 51:48.297
Okay?

51:48.317 --> 51:48.537
Right.

51:50.039 --> 51:58.888
See how they use stone to cover their... This is the Catholicon.

51:59.577 --> 52:28.015
and these are two chapels full of treasures as I will show you later actually you see a brownish color on the domes of Orthodox Greek monasteries and a greenish color on, if you remember, on the Russian that is because copper oxide is green and lead oxide is brown

52:28.670 --> 52:56.753
Byzantines used lead and the Russians used copper to cover their domes okay this is why the different color and okay as you see many chimneys and let's go in in here this is a small chapel they share the best small icons I've seen in my life

52:57.442 --> 53:02.710
if you can get a chance to get in how do I do this?

53:02.730 --> 53:18.694
well attempt to to bribe them I hate to tell you this but it seems that money well give them perhaps a thousand the moment they realize that you're willing to give some money can I do this?

53:19.235 --> 53:24.563
yes in private every time you see some of them go like this

53:25.471 --> 53:31.879
Okay, because to indicate your respect and reverence, because this is how it is.

53:32.260 --> 53:44.857
And when you kiss his hand, or at least pretend, give him some hand.

53:45.357 --> 53:45.898
Okay?

53:46.759 --> 53:48.842
No, no, no, I'm breaking down.

53:52.026 --> 53:52.727
Nice, huh?

53:56.352 --> 54:00.177
Now, this is their mess hall.

54:00.818 --> 54:01.158
Okay?

54:01.379 --> 54:02.440
They eat together.

54:03.021 --> 54:13.114
What's really important to see is a scene of the dormition of Saint Athanasius the Athanite, who is the founder of the monastery.

54:14.175 --> 54:14.456
Okay?

54:14.856 --> 54:17.600
Now, this is to show you how big it is.

54:19.082 --> 54:21.125
Now, what have we here?

54:21.886 --> 54:25.330
Remember I told you of the monk that calls everybody into the noise ark?

54:26.272 --> 54:32.261
See, he has a hammer, a wooden hammer, and hits this thing that looks like an oar.

54:33.863 --> 54:35.325
And calls everybody into the monastery.

54:36.307 --> 54:37.989
Other monks live outside of the monastery.

54:38.009 --> 54:39.031
This is the wall of the monastery.

54:39.111 --> 54:40.813
Other monks, this is the Catholicone of the monastery.

54:40.894 --> 54:43.117
Other monks live outside of the monastery in caves.

54:43.878 --> 54:48.405
Imitating people of the Old Testament, prophets of the Old Testament.

54:48.425 --> 54:49.086
And Elijah.

54:49.687 --> 54:50.308
They have other books.

54:50.548 --> 54:51.489
They have, yes.

54:51.509 --> 54:53.813
They have a stillite.

54:54.854 --> 54:56.076
A man that lives in a pole.

54:57.338 --> 54:57.698
okay?

54:58.399 --> 55:21.811
and somebody is feeding him here you see faces that can be identified we know who they are present in the dormition of Saint Athanasius whose soul travels to heaven with the help of an angel and is depicted as a small baby the soul of Athanasius how would you know that?

55:21.831 --> 55:24.975
how would a person walking in know all this?

55:24.995 --> 55:26.417
because the man

55:26.617 --> 55:55.662
who painted he had the list of invitations they knew who the visitors were okay so again as you say they're telling them what to express oh definitely they knew they knew this is groups of saints entering paradise royalty you see the crowns yes bishops

55:56.890 --> 55:57.711
You see the garment.

55:58.732 --> 55:59.113
Monks.

56:00.374 --> 56:02.157
And last but not least, women.

56:03.558 --> 56:05.501
Women in Byzantium, okay?

56:06.502 --> 56:08.404
Like in any medieval society.

56:08.425 --> 56:10.928
So they had women represented there other than the Virgin.

56:11.548 --> 56:11.909
Oh, yes.

56:12.590 --> 56:12.790
Yes.

56:13.451 --> 56:15.213
But in small scale.

56:18.017 --> 56:20.940
And that will never change with the women, right?

56:21.120 --> 56:21.261
No.

56:21.321 --> 56:22.582
Not in foreseeable future.

56:23.524 --> 56:25.226
And as far as I'm concerned, that's okay with me.

56:25.326 --> 56:26.307
That's fine, you know.

56:27.333 --> 56:36.541
Well, this is the tree of genealogy of Christ.

56:36.561 --> 56:36.862
Okay?

56:37.362 --> 56:39.064
Jacob is asleep here.

56:40.445 --> 56:51.235
King's... Detail, huh?

56:51.255 --> 56:52.196
Virgin Mary here.

56:52.716 --> 56:53.377
It's amazing.

56:53.597 --> 56:55.118
You will see this in love, if you go.

56:55.138 --> 56:55.699
You will see.

56:55.719 --> 56:56.800
This is in the mess hall.

56:56.948 --> 56:59.992
This is called the trapeza.

57:03.057 --> 57:15.113
Three agiographical zones, all standing saints, martyrdom, scenes from early Christianity, heads are rolling down, people are burned alive, see heads are rolling.

57:18.258 --> 57:25.588
And scenes from the Akathistos Hymnos on the top.

57:26.885 --> 57:31.132
It's a light word.

57:32.033 --> 57:32.895
Yeah, you like that, huh?

57:33.075 --> 57:34.477
I've got to see at least one line.

57:34.497 --> 57:35.419
Yeah, you will see.

57:35.439 --> 57:35.759
You will.

57:36.280 --> 57:39.025
You tell them who you are and what you are.

57:39.626 --> 57:41.849
And I didn't bring any books because they're too heavy to carry.

57:41.869 --> 57:42.831
No, no, no, don't.

57:42.851 --> 57:50.884
Well, explain to them and use the persuasive power of a thousand drachmas beer.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.702
And who do I direct this to, the individual?

57:53.722 --> 57:54.503
To the librarian.

57:54.884 --> 57:56.045
How do I get to find the librarian?

57:56.065 --> 57:57.166
Oh, you ask who is the librarian.

57:59.950 --> 58:01.611
I might even give them an American five.

58:01.631 --> 58:02.553
I get some American.

58:02.573 --> 58:03.594
Do they like American money?

58:03.754 --> 58:05.296
Yeah, they like any kind of money.

58:05.316 --> 58:07.118
And believe me, they know precisely how much they work.

58:08.119 --> 58:09.981
But I want some fives.

58:10.021 --> 58:11.242
Better than I do.

58:11.363 --> 58:12.304
And for some big things.

58:12.564 --> 58:13.365
Here, here, here.

58:13.465 --> 58:15.968
And I get a couple of tenths.

58:16.028 --> 58:17.710
You do what you have to do.

58:18.090 --> 58:18.711
That's right.

58:19.028 --> 58:20.790
You don't go there every day.

58:20.851 --> 58:24.075
No question about it.

58:24.095 --> 58:25.878
This is an illuminated manuscript.

58:28.722 --> 58:36.953
This is Christ blessing the apostles in Galilee and blessing them so they would catch fish.

58:36.973 --> 58:38.135
See how small it is.

58:38.956 --> 58:47.027
You know, the study of these little illuminations is interesting because they deviate from the norm.

58:47.513 --> 58:53.002
Well, they did because that's the story of all illuminators.

58:53.022 --> 58:53.783
They had their fun.

58:53.803 --> 58:59.533
Not only that, but they're directed to people who should not be shocked.

58:59.693 --> 59:02.518
Here, as you will see, this is an alpha.

59:04.701 --> 59:07.606
This is a capital alpha letter of the alphabet.

59:07.907 --> 59:14.297
Christ and the two women that come and want to check them out.

59:16.336 --> 59:29.669
because they see him after the resurrection.

59:29.689 --> 59:45.904
Now, this is... Lithovolite is a martyr, the first martyr, Stephen, Stephanos, that is stoned to death by the Jews.

59:47.065 --> 59:53.471
Among those who were stoning him was Saul.

59:53.491 --> 59:57.595
Saint Paul later on.

59:57.755 --> 01:00:02.739
There's also secular manuscripts here too, right?

01:00:02.879 --> 01:00:05.141
No, no, no, no.

01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:07.063
Well, a few famous ones.

01:00:07.764 --> 01:00:08.705
A few famous ones.

01:00:08.785 --> 01:00:14.190
Here, the Christ is... Here you have nude.

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:16.752
You don't see that in church, ever.

01:00:17.221 --> 01:00:21.245
The two men possessed by demons, okay?

01:00:21.525 --> 01:00:22.746
You know, this is in the gospel.

01:00:28.232 --> 01:00:32.376
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:32.936
Yes.

01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:35.338
The flight to Egypt.

01:00:40.243 --> 01:00:41.364
Now, did you take these pictures?

01:00:41.645 --> 01:00:41.825
Yes.

01:00:42.085 --> 01:00:44.667
So they let you see the... No, I'll tell you how it's done.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:45.688
See?

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:46.249
Christ?

01:00:46.617 --> 01:01:04.718
with genitals amazing I've never seen a naked person this is what I'm talking about and this is why I have this because that's precisely what I'm trying to indicate I tell my audience now is this a monk trying to be cute or something?

01:01:04.738 --> 01:01:14.869
no no no no these were given to high standing officials you know better than I do perhaps since you've done so much research in the West

01:01:15.389 --> 01:01:44.113
how expensive these books were and how scriptoria operated this was not for every Tom, Dick and Harry this was given to bishops to high officials who could appreciate what was in it and perhaps they even directed that realism okay this went to specific audience they knew what they were doing and to whom

01:01:44.212 --> 01:01:44.793
This book.

01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:47.737
This is before the age of Christ.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:49.599
Oh.

01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:49.779
Oh.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:50.921
Hundreds of years ago.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:51.442
Oh, yes.

01:01:51.602 --> 01:01:54.165
That's 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th century.

01:01:54.846 --> 01:01:55.667
8th century.

01:01:55.687 --> 01:01:56.649
We have amazing.

01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.610
Okay?

01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:58.611
This is what it is.

01:02:02.196 --> 01:02:07.703
This is the destruction of the walls of Jericho.

01:02:08.584 --> 01:02:09.265
The trumpets.

01:02:10.587 --> 01:02:11.148
Joshua.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:12.750
Okay?

01:02:16.915 --> 01:02:19.017
This is a scene of annunciation.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:29.748
The angel, the angel calls a staff and not a lily, as the Catholics said it.

01:02:30.149 --> 01:02:35.474
The lily is a symbol of a Catholic of Genova.

01:02:36.476 --> 01:02:45.505
It's not the, this is the that all heralds hold in their hands when they appear to

01:02:46.126 --> 01:02:47.007
officially.

01:02:47.287 --> 01:02:48.989
They call Kyricion, there is a step.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:50.891
This is where the angel is falling.

01:02:54.054 --> 01:02:55.575
The feeding of the multitude.

01:02:56.877 --> 01:03:06.066
Again in an illuminated manuscript.

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:11.411
In every Katholikon you will see a huge chandelier.

01:03:12.592 --> 01:03:15.795
It's called the Chorus of the Apostles because

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:23.928
There are twelve, this is hidden behind a candle, there are twelve such little icons of the apostles, okay?

01:03:24.249 --> 01:03:40.388
It's a huge, this is enamel, these are things that are amazing, pieces of oil.

01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:44.213
Litany, for some reason or other.

01:03:44.648 --> 01:04:14.115
perhaps because it rains too much because it doesn't rain fire pestilence Greek police of course the political authorities and a miraculous icon okay they chant at night you will see this and of course Pasolini would have a ball with his face look at this one

01:04:15.665 --> 01:04:17.187
If that guy impresses you.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:23.474
You know, these photographs are very hard to come by.

01:04:24.636 --> 01:04:27.199
They don't like to be photographed.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.300
They eat.

01:04:29.201 --> 01:04:32.285
And they obey some rule of silence.

01:04:32.946 --> 01:04:33.967
They eat.

01:04:33.987 --> 01:04:37.871
And they have one man read the script while they eat.

01:04:38.392 --> 01:04:39.013
They don't talk.

01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:43.478
You'll experience this because you will sit on a huge mess hall like this.

01:04:47.609 --> 01:05:03.312
These are small bells and they're played simultaneously and they create an amazing effect.

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:09.000
A mechanic proudly presenting his skills.

01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:12.646
He was Mr. Fixit in Vatopedi but he's dead now.

01:05:13.207 --> 01:05:15.490
How do you address these monks?

01:05:16.752 --> 01:05:18.094
My father is a priest.

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:29.170
You can't go wrong if you call any of these men GERONDA.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:32.675
Regardless of age, because GERONDA means old man.

01:05:32.915 --> 01:05:34.337
But regardless of age is GERONDA.

01:05:35.118 --> 01:05:39.164
GERONDA, GERONDA, and if you see somebody you say EVLOGYTE.

01:05:40.205 --> 01:05:41.768
EVLOGYTE.

01:05:42.509 --> 01:05:44.832
It means bless me.

01:05:44.852 --> 01:05:45.493
Bless us.

01:05:46.368 --> 01:05:47.069
Please bless us.

01:05:48.571 --> 01:05:51.015
And he would respond, the Lord.

01:05:52.677 --> 01:05:55.181
How about this one?

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.403
This is my pride and joy.

01:05:56.443 --> 01:05:58.146
Look at this.

01:05:58.166 --> 01:06:00.369
That's the first thing we say?

01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:03.353
And you call him?

01:06:03.373 --> 01:06:08.461
If necessary to use a title or to address him.

01:06:11.606 --> 01:06:13.168
However, is the key.

01:06:14.228 --> 01:06:16.512
They know, then they know that you know.

01:06:18.735 --> 01:06:20.599
I'm going to write it down.

01:06:21.059 --> 01:06:22.121
Look at it.

01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:24.946
That's a wonderful photograph.

01:06:25.026 --> 01:06:26.809
That's excellent.

01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:28.091
And I've done a lot of photography.

01:06:28.111 --> 01:06:31.276
Look at it across the motion of the water in the background.

01:06:31.316 --> 01:06:32.097
This is from the boat.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.682
But it's wonderful.

01:06:34.702 --> 01:06:39.730
This man does all this perhaps to get a bag of eggs.

01:06:41.279 --> 01:06:45.243
Half carton of eggs, six eggs perhaps, a little coffee.

01:06:45.724 --> 01:06:51.490
No, no, he comes to the boat, because the boat cannot go to him, the sea is very rough, to get some supplies.

01:06:52.892 --> 01:06:53.172
Okay?

01:06:53.512 --> 01:07:00.660
Well, this is usually the answer to people that say monasticism is usually a heaven for lazy people, for bombs and things.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.561
This is not true.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.404
Believe me, I've been there many, many, many times.

01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:09.750
And the general impression is that you have to have faith.

01:07:10.456 --> 01:07:15.723
If you don't have faith, you cannot stay there for more than 24 hours, 40 hours, 3 days, 4 days, then you go crazy.

01:07:17.305 --> 01:07:17.946
The monotony.

01:07:19.127 --> 01:07:20.449
The difference from everyday life.

01:07:22.712 --> 01:07:23.473
The lack of noise.

01:07:25.215 --> 01:07:26.277
The lack of diversity.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:34.007
Unless you have a deep faith, you simply don't survive there.

01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:35.148
You go crazy.

01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:39.754
Perhaps divine inspiration.

01:07:40.679 --> 01:07:41.020
Okay?

01:07:42.502 --> 01:08:05.898
There are many desperate, destitute people that find shelter in the monasteries, like this old man, perhaps sent away by his children.

01:08:05.918 --> 01:08:06.158
Okay?

01:08:06.639 --> 01:08:07.260
Rejected.

01:08:07.882 --> 01:08:09.724
They go there, they work.

01:08:10.305 --> 01:08:13.388
There is a symbiosis.

01:08:13.408 --> 01:08:15.030
What brings young men there today?

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:18.053
Well, that is a sociological phenomenon.

01:08:18.073 --> 01:08:18.674
It's amazing.

01:08:18.714 --> 01:08:24.481
The level, the educational level of the people that go there is amazing.

01:08:24.521 --> 01:08:26.022
Doctors, lawyers, amazing.

01:08:26.042 --> 01:08:26.843
But they may go to state.

01:08:27.083 --> 01:08:28.225
Yes, perhaps.

01:08:29.266 --> 01:08:33.991
They get fed up with what is outside and they seek a better place.

01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:35.593
Precisely, the same spirit.

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.802
that guided the early Christians to go there.

01:08:38.822 --> 01:08:39.342
To guided what?

01:08:39.843 --> 01:08:56.725
Early Christians to go into seclusion away from this earth, the cosmos that no longer seems to satisfy their need for virtue, for truth.

01:08:58.427 --> 01:09:00.670
This is my favourite.

01:09:01.711 --> 01:09:04.855
What he wears is, we call it Tsarusha.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.723
This is what I photographed.

01:09:06.763 --> 01:09:11.588
These are whole pieces of pig skin rolled around.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:13.270
Okay?

01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:15.192
This is as primitive as you can get.

01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:25.984
He is Slav, perhaps a Serbian monk, because you can tell by the foot he wears.

01:09:27.285 --> 01:09:34.673
If you see these hands, they certainly don't belong to someone who is an idol.

01:09:36.442 --> 01:09:40.246
And the face indicates harsh life, yes.

01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:43.069
And he's probably dead 20 years ago.

01:09:43.409 --> 01:09:44.350
This is very early.

01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:49.675
Fortunately, they are processed by Kodak and I have a date on every one of those.

01:09:51.637 --> 01:09:53.039
Are they very interesting?

01:09:53.059 --> 01:09:53.339
Yes.

01:09:53.820 --> 01:10:05.892
In fact, since Christians in general, monks in particular, believe that our life on this earth is nothing more than a brief interval

01:10:06.614 --> 01:10:23.072
we have to prove our worth to enter the one eternal everlasting and real life after death, they pay little attention as to how this life is spent.

01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:36.047
This is why church rarely intervenes in affairs of state, rarely raises a voice against slavery and against oppression, because they believe that

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:44.540
A horse life is a better way for you to prove your worth entering paradise.

01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:46.242
Okay?

01:10:46.282 --> 01:10:47.444
This is their philosophy.

01:10:47.464 --> 01:10:48.846
You can take it or leave it.

01:10:48.966 --> 01:10:56.938
But this explains why monasteries, for example, never accepted runaway slaves.

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:03.267
You can be a realist or endowed

01:11:04.833 --> 01:11:07.276
the theory, okay?

01:11:07.356 --> 01:11:14.203
And say, well, it was good for them, they play along with the state.

01:11:15.024 --> 01:11:26.475
However, this is what the scripture says, and this is what one is forced to explain, he must explain when he talks about these things.

01:11:26.495 --> 01:11:33.743
And this vanity is expressed by

01:11:34.465 --> 01:11:43.799
This painting that indicates the difficulty for anyone, and it's very popular, to enter the kingdom of heaven.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.026
See, everybody starts... The climax, yes.

01:11:48.086 --> 01:11:54.556
They were going up with the help of angels, but some of them are pulled down by demons.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:55.257
See a demon there?

01:11:56.179 --> 01:12:02.228
And they fall into Hades that here has the shape of a huge dragon.

01:12:02.545 --> 01:12:30.662
few are eventually blessed to go up in the hands of Christ okay this is actually this this is what the life of the monk is all about a constant strive to go to heaven to secure a place in heaven and to indicate the vanity of all of things they freely display

01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:47.365
In every monastery, the skulls of monks that live before them, simply to indicate that vanity, vanitatis, there is nothing.

01:12:47.385 --> 01:12:49.368
Aren't you supposed to be buried with your whole body?

01:12:49.388 --> 01:12:50.169
No, they don't.

01:12:50.249 --> 01:12:59.940
They exhumed, after some years, they exhumed the body and the bones are placed in a place where bones are kept.

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:01.357
And they kept the stars.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:01.998
Yes.

01:13:02.018 --> 01:13:03.842
How old might some of these people be?

01:13:04.323 --> 01:13:04.864
Oh, God.

01:13:04.924 --> 01:13:05.185
Yes.

01:13:05.706 --> 01:13:06.868
Only God knows.

01:13:06.888 --> 01:13:11.137
However, since Christians are not like the other people, we should not despair.

01:13:11.698 --> 01:13:13.221
Does everybody get to see those?

01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:14.503
Yes, at the thought of death.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.608
Because, you see this?

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.878
For Christians, there is hope of a resurrection.

01:13:30.127 --> 01:13:32.550
So those novels are, that's respect.

01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:33.452
Yes.

01:13:34.613 --> 01:13:38.699
You had a few quotes last night that I said, remember to say them because they were so good.

01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:41.423
We're talking about Mount Athos as a living organism.

01:13:41.824 --> 01:13:43.706
Yes, it's a living monument.

01:13:43.726 --> 01:13:49.475
It's a living monument of the Byzantine world, Mount Athos.

01:13:49.615 --> 01:13:51.978
Does the Byzantine world live there in your view?

01:13:51.998 --> 01:13:52.859
Yes, yes.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:55.704
Whatever is left of it is there.

01:13:56.224 --> 01:13:58.868
And was this a sanctuary for the Byzantine world?

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:26.965
Actually, the Byzantine world in 1453, all that's left standing was the institutional church which helped to take Greeks through the difficult years, 400 of them, 400 years of

01:14:28.328 --> 01:14:30.531
The first salvation, slavery.

01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:31.072
400 years.

01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:36.880
It took 400 years for Greeks to liberate themselves from the Turks.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:45.232
And the church was able to keep things together, to remind Greeks who were.

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:49.458
That was the only institution that was left standing.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.146
And the church, but also particularly in Mount Athos, would you say?

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:55.787
Yes.

01:14:56.206 --> 01:15:07.817
because Mount Athos was always the avant-garde and there was always the right wing of the church.

01:15:07.857 --> 01:15:25.133
The church had to make... Actually they were

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:34.095
The church of course includes monastic movement, yes, includes the monks.

01:15:34.716 --> 01:15:48.469
But the monks maintain some autonomy because they have three virtues not easily found in the rest of the church.

01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:53.314
Were theoretically without property

01:15:55.100 --> 01:16:24.094
and theoretically did not get married and were against all desires of the flesh and that puts them aside and the third pillar of which monasticism is resting is their obedience to a certain way of life and certain behavior and this obedience was usually taught to them by an older man

01:16:25.576 --> 01:16:28.420
And thus is how the system perpetuated itself.

01:16:29.782 --> 01:16:34.609
Orwell says in 1984, he who controls the present controls the past.

01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:37.414
He who controls the past controls the future.

01:16:37.754 --> 01:16:41.419
If you're going to eradicate a people, you have to eradicate their history.

01:16:41.439 --> 01:16:42.141
Yes.

01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:43.963
And the church did not allow that to happen.

01:16:45.505 --> 01:16:51.955
The church played a very important role during the lean years of...

01:16:52.272 --> 01:16:59.661
With the fall of Constantinople in 1453, was there kind of a migration?

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:03.666
Did refugees... No, because they did not have where to go.

01:17:04.407 --> 01:17:04.747
They what?

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:06.369
They didn't have any place to go.

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:10.655
Refugees... Well, actually, let's put it this way.

01:17:11.756 --> 01:17:20.727
The relations between the central government and the regions around Constantinople

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.363
were not very friendly anyway.

01:17:24.383 --> 01:17:29.408
And the people did not really give a damn to whom they paid their taxes to.

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.770
Okay.

01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:40.220
People with money, people who knew better, had already gone before the coming of the Muslims.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:44.224
Because this empire was long gone.

01:17:44.504 --> 01:17:50.190
In fact, the empire was basically destroyed in 1204 when it was sacked by the Crusaders.

01:17:50.710 --> 01:18:18.169
okay this is how the story goes now anybody who had any any any money had already fled they said send their families away and those who stood and died well that's not just looking at the map yes that's an interesting map well that's that's a roman time in a that's a roman world from an empire what accounts for this

01:18:18.436 --> 01:18:22.600
It wasn't just the preservation of faith and religion.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:28.025
What accounts for all of the preservation of the art and the production of the icons and the music?

01:18:28.125 --> 01:18:29.847
Because that was a popular item.

01:18:31.048 --> 01:18:33.871
And that was a part of the practicing religion.

01:18:34.571 --> 01:18:36.613
And because the Turks... Popular in what respect?

01:18:36.773 --> 01:18:38.295
Because everybody wanted to have one.

01:18:38.595 --> 01:18:40.517
You mean they did it for commercial purposes?

01:18:40.697 --> 01:18:41.538
Of course they did.

01:18:41.558 --> 01:18:42.078
The monks did.

01:18:42.459 --> 01:18:43.139
Yes.

01:18:43.159 --> 01:18:44.781
Don't forget that in the Creed,

01:18:45.318 --> 01:18:59.633
the 16th century paintings, they're a Cretan art, and they're expressed basically, this trend was expressed by, it was originated and made popular by a man called Theophanes.

01:18:59.813 --> 01:19:14.228
And later on, here they painted for two customers, the traditional, for the enslaved Byzantine world, and some of them were painted

01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:17.194
for the Italians in maniera greca.

01:19:18.456 --> 01:19:18.736
Okay?

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:26.809
They painted different things for the Italians and the West.

01:19:28.451 --> 01:19:29.272
But these are the monks.

01:19:29.673 --> 01:19:32.157
So they were being spiritual on the one hand.

01:19:32.177 --> 01:19:32.958
And not only.

01:19:32.978 --> 01:19:34.821
But actual prudors and men.

01:19:34.861 --> 01:19:35.942
Well, listen.

01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:38.767
You have to do something to keep body and soul together.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.110
And this is what they did.

01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:46.567
Again, how many of them really believed and how many did not.

01:19:46.587 --> 01:19:50.252
It's a matter of discussion.

01:19:50.272 --> 01:19:57.162
But again, what is there a way to tell a believer?

01:19:58.143 --> 01:19:59.926
And you've been going, you said, since 1967?

01:20:00.847 --> 01:20:01.628
You have been going?

01:20:01.648 --> 01:20:01.849
67.

01:20:02.349 --> 01:20:04.212
And why did you make the first trip?

01:20:04.529 --> 01:20:12.419
Because I was in Greece and I was advised that I should go to Mount Athos.

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:17.405
I know Byzantine music and I can chant in the church.

01:20:18.186 --> 01:20:28.439
I was always going to church and in the United States I made my good living by chanting in the church.

01:20:28.479 --> 01:20:29.220
I made good money.

01:20:29.993 --> 01:20:37.602
When in the supermarket I was a dollar and I was getting a dollar and a quarter an hour in the early sixties.

01:20:38.683 --> 01:20:46.953
In church I could make five or ten dollars in one morning if I would send in a wedding and baptism.

01:20:47.033 --> 01:20:47.393
Okay?

01:20:47.413 --> 01:20:51.838
And I was associated and of course when I went to go to my house to take some pictures.

01:20:52.499 --> 01:20:54.221
And that did it.

01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:55.523
And I don't... But what did it?

01:20:55.543 --> 01:20:56.484
You said what struck you?

01:20:57.325 --> 01:20:58.646
Oh, everything.

01:20:58.766 --> 01:20:59.427
The whole experience.

01:20:59.609 --> 01:21:00.410
God.

01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:01.812
Everything.

01:21:01.852 --> 01:21:03.635
This is an amazing experience.

01:21:03.795 --> 01:21:06.740
Provide, of course, that you have the background for it, okay?

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.348
If you get somebody from Tanganyika or Timbuktu, I don't know.

01:21:12.809 --> 01:21:18.778
But anyone that is associated with Western civilization is amazed.

01:21:19.879 --> 01:21:21.862
And wants to go back.

01:21:22.063 --> 01:21:22.383
Oh, yes.

01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:23.625
Well, I'll tell you this much.

01:21:23.965 --> 01:21:27.491
I believe that what we have in Mount Athos is no longer Greek heritage.

01:21:27.571 --> 01:21:29.093
In fact, it is

01:21:29.512 --> 01:21:31.754
belongs to the Western Civilization.

01:21:31.774 --> 01:21:32.515
That's a great quote.

01:21:32.675 --> 01:21:33.856
That's at 1965.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:35.057
Do that again?

01:21:35.477 --> 01:21:47.308
Well, actually, I believe that what treasures are still in Mount Athos and don't belong to Greeks or to Orthodoxy alone.

01:21:47.328 --> 01:21:57.898
They are the heritage, in fact, of Western Civilization, and I hope Western Civilization appreciates that and protects them as they have done in the past.

01:21:58.992 --> 01:22:01.675
You know, there's a fellow named Robert Curzon, have you ever heard of him?

01:22:01.695 --> 01:22:01.895
Yes.

01:22:01.915 --> 01:22:08.882
And I've read his book, and he describes going there, and he makes fun of them, the smell of the garlic, to get in there, he eats garlic.

01:22:09.442 --> 01:22:13.166
My friend, as I said... And he steals things, or he bribes them.

01:22:13.186 --> 01:22:13.847
Of course he does.

01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:15.068
And he takes them to England.

01:22:15.088 --> 01:22:15.168
Yes.

01:22:15.188 --> 01:22:17.911
And he's bragging in this book about how he got these things.

01:22:17.931 --> 01:22:18.671
Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:18.932 --> 01:22:24.477
Well, no wonder monks are so...

01:22:25.098 --> 01:22:25.919
Apprehensive?

01:22:25.999 --> 01:22:28.962
Apprehensive, so... Anxious?

01:22:29.242 --> 01:22:29.763
Protective?

01:22:29.803 --> 01:22:31.024
Yes, protective.

01:22:31.304 --> 01:22:31.845
Suspicious?

01:22:31.865 --> 01:22:32.545
Oh, wow.

01:22:32.565 --> 01:22:32.946
All those words.

01:22:32.966 --> 01:22:34.687
This is the word I was looking for.

01:22:34.727 --> 01:22:37.270
Overly suspicious.

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:41.935
And they had every right to believe me.

01:22:42.095 --> 01:22:48.861
Pages with illuminated mind scripts were simply cut off and rolled up and taken away.

01:22:48.941 --> 01:22:49.362
Amazing.

01:22:49.962 --> 01:22:51.704
No wonder they won't let you touch anything.

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:53.586
And I understand that fully.

01:22:53.903 --> 01:22:57.567
And I understand now that even if somebody is working in the library, there has to be two monks.

01:22:58.608 --> 01:23:02.992
Yes, but again, if they don't trust you.

01:23:03.032 --> 01:23:08.017
In fact, I was able to go there and photograph almost anything I like, as you did see.

01:23:08.377 --> 01:23:09.298
But it took me years.

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:22.071
And of course, I would satisfy their requests, like bringing things like fresh coffee or perhaps a book or whatever they wanted.

01:23:22.405 --> 01:23:26.569
Okay, books, binoculars, but this is of the record.

01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:32.035
I don't understand why they need binoculars so much, but they can.

01:23:32.055 --> 01:23:34.438
Well, see, my motto is this.

01:23:34.838 --> 01:23:48.313
If anyone says anything bad about Marotathos, I say, well, the God of the Old Testament did not destroy Nineveh, because there was one righteous man there.

01:23:48.953 --> 01:23:50.455
Oh yeah, well, I'll be the last one to

01:23:50.654 --> 01:23:57.806
If you look at the map of the world and Europe, Mount Athos is just a little finger.

01:23:58.226 --> 01:23:59.428
Oh yes, a little nothing there.

01:23:59.448 --> 01:24:02.373
Just a little finger and they mind their own business.

01:24:02.393 --> 01:24:08.783
And if you don't like what they're doing... It's a big world!

01:24:08.823 --> 01:24:17.978
Don't you know that one of the worst attributes of man's character, the soul of man is precisely that.

01:24:18.869 --> 01:24:46.007
to be attracted by the difference and try to either incorporate or destroy it i mean i think that's one of the negative attributes of western civilization i mean we have an amazing it's it's almost a mania would you agree with the expression that this is kind of a time capsule yes this is uh well put and in fact i think that's the only way i believe that if you go to mount atos in fact you step back into the past provided once again

01:24:46.409 --> 01:24:53.078
that you have the sensors to appreciate what is offered.

01:24:53.519 --> 01:25:08.760
If you cannot see, you cannot appreciate a painting, if you cannot smell, if you cannot hear, if you cannot taste, here there is an extra sensory thing, a perception that goes beyond the senses.

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:14.087
And I think this is directly, it appeals directly to your soul.

01:25:14.219 --> 01:25:18.505
This is how it's done.

01:25:19.145 --> 01:25:23.591
You let your soul appreciate Mount Athos.

01:25:24.633 --> 01:25:26.816
Don't try to scrutinize through logic.

01:25:27.717 --> 01:25:32.583
This is not what Christianity is all about.

01:25:36.949 --> 01:25:38.191
We're doing very well here.

01:25:39.112 --> 01:25:41.455
I'm sorry, I had a thought there and I lost it.

01:25:41.715 --> 01:25:42.336
It happens.

01:25:42.822 --> 01:25:47.947
This thing about the women, want to just make a statement on that?

01:25:48.788 --> 01:25:49.248
Definitely.

01:25:49.308 --> 01:25:53.633
Well, actually, there are different ways to look at it.

01:25:54.573 --> 01:25:57.777
The modern and temporary way.

01:25:58.637 --> 01:26:00.940
Of course, women are a temptation, there's no question about it.

01:26:01.841 --> 01:26:04.964
The great... But is that why they are prohibited?

01:26:04.984 --> 01:26:05.864
Because they're a temptation?

01:26:05.945 --> 01:26:06.585
Well, I'll tell you.

01:26:07.346 --> 01:26:09.488
Basically, the basic thought

01:26:09.991 --> 01:26:39.441
fathers that helped shape monasticism as Basil the Great earlier times and Theodor of Studium the Studite in the ninth century believed that by bringing women or female animals into Mount Athos actually you recreate a microcosm similar to

01:26:39.742 --> 01:26:41.525
to the world you left behind.

01:26:42.807 --> 01:27:02.258
Because you import, you bring along that which the Greeks called or everyday life tasks and things to do.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.884
You bring the problems of every life

01:27:06.522 --> 01:27:10.648
every life problems, everyday life problems.

01:27:10.668 --> 01:27:22.845
You recreate family, you recreate problems, you recreate the needs away from which you run in order to devote yourself to God.

01:27:22.866 --> 01:27:28.053
What they want to do is this.

01:27:30.216 --> 01:27:36.445
On one to one basis attempt to rise in a higher sphere.

01:27:36.948 --> 01:27:41.832
and be able to get close to Divinity before they die.

01:27:42.553 --> 01:27:44.875
Cleanse their soul, purify their soul.

01:27:44.895 --> 01:27:50.240
That you cannot do if you have next to you a source of carnal temptation.

01:27:51.301 --> 01:27:59.268
Because basic pillar upon which monasticism is based is the virginity of the body and the soul.

01:28:00.329 --> 01:28:04.773
And mortification of the desires of the flesh.

01:28:04.793 --> 01:28:05.213
Okay?

01:28:05.233 --> 01:28:06.094
That is true.

01:28:06.412 --> 01:28:09.736
to Orthodox monasticism and to Western monasticism as well.

01:28:10.236 --> 01:28:20.467
Orthodox kept it more and better because here the Empire has an Emperor that would keep your behind.

01:28:20.527 --> 01:28:21.909
Okay?

01:28:21.949 --> 01:28:23.390
The law stands in the West.

01:28:24.151 --> 01:28:25.993
The Church and the Papacy is the law.

01:28:27.174 --> 01:28:33.221
No wonder the clergy in the West has problems like we all know.

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:34.542
The Popes.

01:28:35.203 --> 01:28:36.064
We never had a

01:28:36.635 --> 01:28:41.402
a patriarch similar to Alexander Borges, to say the least.

01:28:42.865 --> 01:28:43.946
Just to give you one example.

01:28:45.469 --> 01:28:51.838
Scandals of that type, sexual scandals are unknown to the Byzantine Church.

01:28:52.439 --> 01:28:52.720
Unknown?

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:53.461
Unknown.

01:28:58.288 --> 01:29:01.193
To the Byzantine higher clergy.

01:29:01.213 --> 01:29:01.493
Okay.

01:29:03.035 --> 01:29:04.077
How about among the monks?

01:29:04.478 --> 01:29:14.788
Among the monks, there are, well, quite a few things, but are you sure you want to get into the subject?

01:29:14.848 --> 01:29:14.969
No.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:19.473
That's just a question that has no... Of the record.

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:20.934
No, no, no, no.

01:29:21.215 --> 01:29:21.715
I trust you.

01:29:22.236 --> 01:29:24.718
If I didn't trust you, I wouldn't talk to you.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:31.986
I don't know how good a man I am, how good a judge I am of human character, but I think I know enough.

01:29:32.026 --> 01:29:33.647
But we're mortal.

01:29:33.667 --> 01:29:34.468
No, I know.

01:29:35.039 --> 01:29:37.668
of men, I know of people, to appreciate.

01:29:37.829 --> 01:29:40.879
I mean, I can... Let's not waste that time on it.

01:29:40.919 --> 01:29:41.301
That's right.

01:29:41.361 --> 01:29:43.027
Now, listen, what I'm trying to say is this.

01:29:43.528 --> 01:29:47.783
In the back, there is an etypicon for every monastery, the founding...
