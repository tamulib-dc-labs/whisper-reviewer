WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:09.673
Jay McInerney.

00:10.173 --> 00:23.575
The red light is going.

00:24.314 --> 00:50.673
It's not an entirely happy proposition.

00:50.693 --> 00:51.334
You know, I think the writers...

00:53.828 --> 01:04.680
traffic and metaphors and symbols, but they shouldn't necessarily be symbols.

01:04.760 --> 01:15.853
And I think that, you know, there's no question that I chronicled in the 80s and New York, New York seemingly the sort of capital of all of the

01:17.150 --> 01:42.718
behavior and excesses that we now associate with the 80s and a lot of people associate me with that behavior and that excess um things they don't like about the 80s probably um i think that in the same way that i was sort of wildly over celebrated as an author i was also made in this kind of scapegoat

01:42.698 --> 01:51.618
sins, the perceived sins of that era.

01:51.638 --> 01:51.858
Yeah, yeah.

01:51.878 --> 02:00.758
And I think I still, one of the things that I've learned is the power of

02:01.615 --> 02:05.383
of the persona, the power of an image, you know.

02:05.403 --> 02:10.353
And he went in the middle and said to me, don't fight it, you know.

02:10.534 --> 02:16.787
The hardest thing for a writer to get is a style, and the second hardest thing is a persona.

02:16.807 --> 02:17.869
And he said, you know,

02:18.676 --> 02:22.805
I think he said it the other way around.

02:22.865 --> 02:32.706
He said a lot of writers have a style, but he said you actually have a public image.

02:32.726 --> 02:32.986
As did he.

02:33.006 --> 02:34.710
As did me, yeah.

02:34.730 --> 02:37.596
But it's fascinating to me how...

02:37.576 --> 02:45.790
how enduring those images could be.

02:45.930 --> 02:57.750
I feel like I've had to gradually lead people away from the idea that I am the character of my life's big city and that's all that I could ever be.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.753
V is a really sort of one-dimensional analogy.

02:59.773 --> 03:01.997
When Michael J. Fox was cast in the

03:02.787 --> 03:21.825
role from the lead in Vital Light's Big City, where he had just come off that television show, Family Tide, and the public had a very powerful image of him as this young Republican, young photo-yuffie, clean-cut kid.

03:21.845 --> 03:29.672
And no matter how great an actor he might be, it was almost impossible for him to be thoroughly convincing in that role.

03:30.395 --> 03:58.647
this i didn't know because i didn't even watch the tv show but in retrospect that's clear to me and it seems likewise that you know when people hear that i spent half my year in tennessee and that i ride horses i have two papers in tennessee right away to take my phone no no really are you talking to frederick couple when we go yeah i don't know i haven't looked at the method schedule yet because he takes my stuff uh

03:59.352 --> 04:28.600
You know, people say, like, you, Tennessee, you, father of twins, as if, you know, for the rest of my life, as if, you know, I was a guy who lived permanently in a nightclub, and it was always 3 a.m., and I was...

04:28.580 --> 04:50.289
always kind of literally dancing the night away, you know what I mean?

04:50.309 --> 04:51.471
It's a bit of a graduate image, you know, on the roof.

04:51.491 --> 04:53.994
For years and years, every time people saw me, they looked like they had Simon Garfunkel singing in the background.

04:54.014 --> 04:54.695
Yeah, they said, blast it.

04:54.715 --> 04:57.699
But here we are, 10 minutes or 15 interviews, and it does get in the way of working, doesn't it?

04:57.719 --> 04:57.980
I mean, yeah.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.300
Well, you know,

04:58.280 --> 05:00.625
I don't mean to whine about it, because I'm all so lucky.

05:00.685 --> 05:09.644
I reached a lot of readers through my first book, and quite a few of them hang on from my other books.

05:09.784 --> 05:16.137
And, you know, it's a very fortunate position to be in, if you're welcome.

05:17.483 --> 05:23.936
if you're a novelist.

05:23.956 --> 05:33.957
But, I don't know, I will be glad when the sort of newer, when and if the newer image of me becomes as real as the old one.

05:33.937 --> 05:54.850
41 years old, father of twins, happily married, mounted on my horse on my farm in Tennessee.

05:54.870 --> 05:55.131
I don't know.

05:55.151 --> 05:57.855
I mean, we've got a little way to get into this Tennessee.

05:57.875 --> 05:58.256
It's kind of funny.

05:58.276 --> 05:58.797
Well, are you enjoying it?

05:58.817 --> 05:59.157
Yeah, yeah, I am.

05:59.177 --> 06:00.479
I mean, I read some place where it's a pain in the ass time.

06:00.499 --> 06:00.940
It's a New York Times.

06:00.920 --> 06:12.177
I don't feel like driving into Nashville every day.

06:12.297 --> 06:18.507
I still have to go to the bottom of the street to get my time.

06:19.718 --> 06:32.193
Well, you know, I do still spend half my year in New York.

06:32.213 --> 06:38.721
And, you know, I think New York will always be a great subject for me.

06:38.741 --> 06:40.463
For better or worse, I find it a great subject.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.845
It seems to be...

06:42.938 --> 06:50.188
something that people expect of me and something that I'm still eager to chronicle.

06:50.308 --> 07:03.748
Although I have to say, after my last book, Brightness Falls, I just thought, I can't possibly write one more word about New York in the 80s, and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting in the air right now.

07:04.248 --> 07:10.798
The zeitgeist was just sort of exhausted back around 92, 91, 92.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.540
It just seemed...

07:13.162 --> 07:16.777
like a good time to get out of town.

07:16.938 --> 07:20.252
And I married someone

07:23.422 --> 07:27.647
I happened to be a native Tennessean.

07:27.667 --> 07:32.553
So, I kind of took that opportunity to step back and step away.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.776
How old was it?

07:34.796 --> 07:36.658
18 months.

07:36.738 --> 07:37.740
A boy and a girl.

07:38.761 --> 07:41.925
His name was Barrett.

07:42.065 --> 07:44.768
John Barrett McInerney III.

07:44.788 --> 07:46.290
And she's amazing.

07:46.270 --> 07:53.077
M-A-I-S-I-E.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.643
M-A-I-S-I-E.

07:55.214 --> 08:01.963
My father's mother, it was her maiden name.

08:02.304 --> 08:05.128
They lived in Wellesley.

08:05.168 --> 08:08.032
Irish, as you might imagine.

08:08.112 --> 08:12.719
All my family is from Boston.

08:12.739 --> 08:17.245
I got two papers in Connecticut.

08:17.265 --> 08:18.707
I was born in Hartford.

08:21.303 --> 08:44.858
My parents, grandparents, their grandparents came from, you know, originally I guess from Lotsbury, but later Newton and Wellesley, and to Williams College, and I went to Williams College.

08:44.878 --> 08:46.400
You know, you thought about developing or establishing a style and a person.

08:46.421 --> 08:47.082
Do you hope that you're disabled?

08:47.102 --> 08:48.103
You're taking affirmative steps in that direction.

08:48.083 --> 08:57.042
Well, this movie is definitely a departure, I think.

08:57.082 --> 09:04.438
The first book that has not been particularly autobiographical

09:04.418 --> 09:13.407
The characters in this book are six years older than me, essentially seven years older than me.

09:13.427 --> 09:23.217
I didn't directly experience the 60s, which is probably about my 60s envy, I guess.

09:23.297 --> 09:29.363
As you know, it takes place over 30 years, which is a very long story.

09:29.343 --> 09:41.480
My books tend to take place over a week or two, which in New York is basically an era.

09:43.403 --> 09:48.530
In New York, that's practically a generation, last week and this week.

09:48.550 --> 09:52.175
I just wanted to do something different.

09:52.195 --> 09:54.418
It's turning.

09:54.438 --> 09:55.840
I wanted to do something different.

09:57.052 --> 10:01.518
I wanted to write from something of a historical perspective.

10:01.538 --> 10:11.531
I wanted to, I got kind of inspired being in the South with the sort of long historical perspective that people have there.

10:11.751 --> 10:25.810
And also, starting to spend time in Tennessee, I kind of brought back a lot of material that I had a Memphis, I had a roommate from Memphis in college, not much like Will, because he was very conservative, but

10:26.633 --> 10:27.415
He was wild.

10:27.795 --> 10:36.633
He was very Republican, but he was very colorful, as so many people from that area are.

10:37.696 --> 10:44.710
And I also went to Mississippi when I was in college in several years.

10:45.517 --> 10:51.525
several times later to pursue my love of the blues.

10:51.545 --> 10:53.708
The Mississippi Delta being left.

10:53.728 --> 11:00.156
I used to go for four or five days, probably four or five times in my adult life.

11:00.797 --> 11:04.101
I've got some people too.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.643
Regional residences I've liked to have.

11:05.783 --> 11:10.670
Yeah, well Mississippi was to me a fascinating place.

11:10.690 --> 11:11.811
I also went to see Mississippi.

11:12.618 --> 11:34.187
my first coach managed to visit Faulkner's home and um i was arrested for climbing in the i went back three times and it was never home so i decided to climb in the window and then the police probably came up and dragged me out of the police station yeah yeah but um but being yeah it was good morning actually

11:35.011 --> 11:43.101
I shouldn't have been sober going to Faulkner South, but I was.

11:43.121 --> 11:51.871
Spending time in the South brought all of this material up and away.

11:53.994 --> 12:01.002
I started going into Memphis because I decided

12:02.112 --> 12:15.968
which is, you know, poor Alex and Nashville, but the kind of character that I thought I was interested in writing about, the Will Savage character, there's actually no way he could have come from Nashville.

12:16.068 --> 12:20.312
I mean, Nashville and Memphis really are very different.

12:20.332 --> 12:27.040
I used to think Peter Taylor was full of it, you know, when he comes to Memphis, when he makes this huge distinction, it's like,

12:27.020 --> 12:33.150
It's like falling from paradise to move from one Tennessee town, Nashville, to Memphis.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.414
And I thought, come on, two Tennessee towns, big deal.

12:35.434 --> 12:36.856
But they really are different.

12:37.958 --> 12:44.208
And between the music and the sort of racial history, the character I was interested in could only have been Memphis.

12:44.228 --> 12:47.273
It would have been more convenient for me if I could have made it.

12:47.759 --> 12:52.603
because that's where I was living.

12:52.623 --> 13:02.892
But I was visiting a friend down in Memphis one day, William Eggleston, the photographer.

13:04.113 --> 13:17.665
And I decided to look in the library at the newspaper clips to see what the reaction had been on the ground to the Martin Luther King assassination.

13:19.535 --> 13:30.818
I sort of accidentally came across a clipping about the first interracial marriage in Tennessee.

13:30.838 --> 13:33.864
Believe it or not, it was that same year, 1968.

13:34.225 --> 13:37.793
And I thought, wow, I wonder what that must have been like.

13:37.813 --> 13:38.995
And that sort of...

13:38.975 --> 13:46.345
That was sort of the journey that indirectly set me off on this path, this book.

13:47.186 --> 13:52.173
On and off for three years.

13:52.894 --> 13:57.020
It's a long time for me.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.241
But it was hard.

13:58.261 --> 13:59.203
I didn't have a model.

13:59.223 --> 14:04.149
It was something I liked, something I'd never done before.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.012
I almost gave up on it a couple of times.

14:06.785 --> 14:13.553
But then I'd finish the draft, put it aside, and then actually in between one of the drafts I wrote another novel.

14:13.694 --> 14:19.841
But then I'd go back and say, yeah, now I see how to go on.

14:20.362 --> 14:24.187
Sometimes it would be three months before I went back to it.

14:24.207 --> 14:26.369
I don't know what we've seen so far.

14:26.389 --> 14:27.831
Most of these persons couldn't pick up from each other.

14:27.811 --> 14:32.018
Yeah, excuse me.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.380
Yeah.

14:33.981 --> 14:51.188
You think they might want to order.

14:51.268 --> 14:52.350
Yeah.

14:52.330 --> 14:59.739
It's more about my image.

14:59.819 --> 15:03.624
I mean, it's just it.

15:03.704 --> 15:09.732
I don't see why, you know, late in life, this is my fifth book.

15:09.832 --> 15:15.779
I'm not going to suddenly start trying to imitate somebody else.

15:15.799 --> 15:17.081
Yeah, I disagree.

15:17.101 --> 15:20.245
It has totally to do with its association that, you know,

15:20.225 --> 15:22.929
It was bad for me from the first bullet that he made.

15:22.949 --> 15:25.053
To find something to emulate, I guess.

15:25.073 --> 15:26.075
No, none of that.

15:26.095 --> 15:27.857
But my life paralleled stuff.

15:27.877 --> 15:32.004
I mean, I don't think anybody would say that Brothers Big City was like any other book on the planet.

15:32.184 --> 15:40.859
And the still notion is another sort of biographical snag, I think.

15:40.879 --> 15:44.224
I mean, there certainly may be some...

15:44.710 --> 15:50.057
of Fitzgerald in my work.

15:50.357 --> 15:58.708
I certainly admire him as a writer, but he's not the only writer, or even my favorite writer.

15:58.728 --> 16:06.077
Basically, the fact that I have a first-person narrator

16:06.057 --> 16:14.489
who seems to remind some people of Nick Carraway, is what seems to me to be built on, and it seems ridiculous to me.

16:14.509 --> 16:19.937
I mean, Nick Carraway barely knows Gatsby, even by the end of the book.

16:20.137 --> 16:24.243
It's a book that takes place over the course of a summer, basically.

16:24.263 --> 16:27.728
I mean, this book is about friendship, and it's about...

16:28.231 --> 16:43.253
two guys to know each other for 30 years and all right i just don't remember i mean if anything the book is more like brideshead revisited than it is like the great gatsby it just seems like really it seems to me like a really lazy compulsive

16:43.233 --> 16:50.968
I mean, if you're speaking of the New York Times review, I mean, Michiko Tsai-Pasani has hated my work from this far.

16:50.988 --> 16:59.183
I think she's, you know, a very pedestrian, um, movie, uh, critic, and, you know, from...

16:59.585 --> 17:03.570
Right from my first novel, she sort of trashed me every time out.

17:03.670 --> 17:09.978
I'm not sure why, but at this point, I would be shocked if she didn't hate my books.

17:10.618 --> 17:12.821
What amazes me?

17:12.861 --> 17:20.270
She had some... She passed it off to somebody else.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.232
That is what amazes me, too.

17:22.453 --> 17:25.997
I thought I was finally clear of her, because last time...

17:25.977 --> 17:32.030
Christopher Lemenhout, who reviewed my book Brightest Falls.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.335
It was a great relief.

17:34.535 --> 17:39.005
I mean, first of all, he liked it.

17:39.085 --> 17:44.577
But secondly, just not to have to listen to Michiko Capitani.

17:45.873 --> 17:56.783
Totally missed the point once again, Gary.

17:56.803 --> 18:04.590
And by the way, I don't want to talk about other reviewers.

18:04.610 --> 18:09.594
I might mention how they're all hopping under the film.

18:09.614 --> 18:09.815
Thank you.

18:09.835 --> 18:10.635
I like Gail's review.

18:10.655 --> 18:11.977
Yeah, she's very good.

18:11.997 --> 18:15.139
She's slowest, and she's a lot smarter than me.

18:15.159 --> 18:15.880
I wish we had her in New York.

18:15.860 --> 18:34.007
It's good to have her left.

18:34.027 --> 18:36.932
Do you like the arc of your career, having said all this other stuff about, you know, perceptions of the 80s and yourself and their lifestyle?

18:36.952 --> 18:37.733
I'd like it better if I didn't have to.

18:39.535 --> 18:49.770
sort of poke me the inevitable back rush to my early success, but it is kind of inevitable, I suppose.

18:49.790 --> 19:06.315
You know, I wouldn't really trade it necessarily for a normal career, for a normal literary career, in which, you know, publish a book, sell 25 hundred copies, get a few good reviews, go on, try and publish the next book.

19:06.335 --> 19:06.876
It's doing...

19:08.138 --> 19:16.128
It's been a very interesting life so far.

19:16.388 --> 19:31.327
And I think being sort of grist for the great American dream machine myself, I've learned a lot about culture, being processed and packaged by the media.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.370
Having been put through that process,

19:34.126 --> 19:37.059
That machine, it's almost like being a political candidate.

19:37.079 --> 19:40.153
I think I've learned things about power.

19:40.960 --> 20:04.047
As I said, that's a culture that I wouldn't know otherwise.

20:04.067 --> 20:04.708
Well, it's amazing what happens.

20:04.728 --> 20:07.130
I mean, Mark Altman, for instance, was the darling who went to the Phoenix, and then they found out he was a Republican.

20:07.151 --> 20:07.611
Now he's got a new job.

20:07.631 --> 20:08.612
I mean, now, you know, my brother wants me to go.

20:08.632 --> 20:09.213
I've been with you last year.

20:09.233 --> 20:09.794
It's just amazing, you know.

20:09.814 --> 20:10.174
Where do you live?

20:10.154 --> 20:31.058
It's a beautiful home.

20:31.078 --> 20:31.739
It's living a very domestic life.

20:31.759 --> 20:32.039
It's gorgeous.

20:32.059 --> 20:32.560
It's absolutely gorgeous.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.661
I read something about him driving his tractor around.

20:33.681 --> 20:33.781
Yeah.

20:33.801 --> 20:34.322
About two hours from here.

20:34.302 --> 20:52.092
Now they review his books at all.

20:52.072 --> 21:15.093
You can't worry about that.

21:15.113 --> 21:18.195
That's right.

21:18.216 --> 21:18.496
You know what?

21:18.516 --> 21:20.658
I mean, right as far as actually, right as far as, I can take a break.

21:20.678 --> 21:20.998
I got maybe 70%.

21:22.042 --> 21:29.513
That could have been very reassuring to you.

21:29.533 --> 21:40.388
It is reassuring, but the funny thing is that I don't think that has anything to do with my sales.

21:40.368 --> 21:44.116
The review is very, really good.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.803
It's an interesting thing to observe.

21:47.823 --> 21:57.021
The very first thing out of the box was Dr. Tanya's review.

21:57.041 --> 22:02.292
For some reason, sales of this book, advanced orders and so on,

22:02.272 --> 22:05.436
quite a lot higher than my last book.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.939
And I don't know why.

22:08.980 --> 22:14.807
It has something really independent of that particular process.

22:14.887 --> 22:22.577
And one of the nice things about going out on tour is that it's not just about getting interviews, it's about going to bookstores.

22:22.597 --> 22:26.722
And so every night, I see readers and talk to them and hear what they like.

22:26.822 --> 22:29.325
Have you read?

22:29.778 --> 22:54.355
Anywhere from, oh, I'd say anywhere from college kids to a little older than me.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.697
So you do have a relationship, but it may well be growing.

22:55.717 --> 22:56.098
Well, one of those.

22:56.118 --> 22:57.400
I think you would agree that this is a great book for you.

22:57.420 --> 22:57.520
Yeah.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.722
Acceptance, critical acceptance of the year you were there.

22:59.697 --> 23:09.540
Do you understand where you work at?

23:09.560 --> 23:12.186
Yeah, but I might not get pretty good acceptance for it.

23:12.206 --> 23:13.108
And that's not something I can worry about.

23:13.128 --> 23:15.674
I understand, but artistically it's also that we've discussed all these amazing departures.

23:15.694 --> 23:16.816
And I would say it's an advancement of your work.

23:16.836 --> 23:17.638
I mean, it's a progression of your work.

23:21.061 --> 23:37.266
You can't see it developing at some point 20 or 30 years from now.

23:37.286 --> 23:42.193
You will be able to look at it.

23:42.213 --> 23:42.874
It's a great idea.

23:42.894 --> 23:43.255
It's a great idea.

23:43.235 --> 23:55.911
is creating a body of work that would be... I mean, I do in the sense that

23:57.832 --> 24:13.911
that I believe, I now have five books, and it's kind of exciting to think, wow, five books, that is kind of a body here.

24:16.374 --> 24:23.923
What I resist slightly, though, is the emotion that

24:26.063 --> 24:29.510
it's necessarily a linear development of some kind.

24:29.750 --> 24:41.875
I'll tell you the critical notion that drives me craziest is what in formal logic is called the intentional fallacy.

24:42.636 --> 24:44.460
And that is this notion of

24:45.031 --> 24:51.305
He obviously wrote this book intending to, you know, or responding to.

24:51.365 --> 25:01.808
I mean, I hate... You know, I sometimes read, when I read these things, which I don't always, when I hear...

25:01.788 --> 25:09.200
some notion of a master plan that I have, you know, and here's why he wrote this.

25:09.761 --> 25:17.833
And I think, I don't know why I wrote that.

25:17.853 --> 25:24.724
The rhyme and reason of the body of work sort of emerges gradually, and it's not a conscious thing.

25:24.704 --> 25:34.119
Jay McInerney, 41 years old in 1996, could not light, still alive, but could not light light today.

25:34.139 --> 25:43.394
I mean, that's his work, and it represents something you did as well as a hell of a many years ago.

25:43.455 --> 25:43.775
It is.

25:43.795 --> 25:47.421
As Heraclitus said, you can't step in the same river twice.

25:47.401 --> 26:09.329
Which is why it really bothers me.

26:09.349 --> 26:10.110
And I really respect like Tim O'Brien.

26:10.130 --> 26:11.372
He tells me that he's going back and tinkering with patriotic.

26:11.392 --> 26:12.173
And I don't think I'm going to keep it.

26:12.193 --> 26:12.493
You're kidding.

26:12.513 --> 26:12.673
For you.

26:12.693 --> 26:12.934
Just for us.

26:12.954 --> 26:14.115
Yeah, just keep going, and he's going to follow this post.

26:14.135 --> 26:14.736
Why would you want to do this?

26:14.756 --> 26:15.897
I have an obligation to make my work as perfect as I can.

26:15.917 --> 26:17.239
I said, you had best dreams for a time 20 years ago, and you know.

26:17.219 --> 26:34.057
I must say that's a mistake.

26:34.077 --> 26:40.043
Is he coming through Tim?

26:40.063 --> 26:46.229
We're old friends, but I have not seen him now in a couple years.

26:46.249 --> 26:46.990
He's terrible.

26:49.163 --> 27:02.410
I read the children's book.

27:02.430 --> 27:02.610
Oh, yeah.

27:02.630 --> 27:02.791
Why not?

27:02.811 --> 27:04.334
I've got a lot of new newspapers now, too, so it's always nice to see.

27:04.354 --> 27:05.356
I have about 25 newspapers that take my pictures.

27:05.376 --> 27:05.937
The best guy it does for me.

27:05.957 --> 27:06.719
Like Eugene Oregon, that guy.

27:06.739 --> 27:06.919
Oh, yeah.

27:06.899 --> 27:23.225
I'm in Salt Lake City, I have Charlottesville, Virginia.

27:23.245 --> 27:24.246
I do this all myself.

27:24.266 --> 27:25.328
I don't have my own syndicate.

27:25.348 --> 27:25.488
Really?

27:25.508 --> 27:27.051
You don't have somebody who sells?

27:27.071 --> 27:27.311
And my wife.

27:27.331 --> 27:27.632
That's awesome.

27:27.652 --> 27:28.152
One of my favorite stuff.

27:28.172 --> 27:28.413
Very nice.

27:28.433 --> 27:29.835
You both did an interview with me and they threw in the studio.

27:30.912 --> 27:40.542
Nicole Miller made one.

27:40.562 --> 27:47.410
They had Bright Lights Big City as one of the books.

27:47.430 --> 27:52.415
Yeah, that's pretty good.

27:52.435 --> 27:53.897
I was pretty psyched about that.

27:53.917 --> 27:58.842
So, what do you, you know, I have a book, of course, and it speaks to myself.

27:58.862 --> 27:59.362
I have a literary review.

27:59.383 --> 28:00.043
I mean, it's the personal stuff.

28:00.063 --> 28:00.784
It would be there.

28:00.764 --> 28:17.232
Which I've met, you know, so it's not necessary for me to ask you what you're doing.

28:17.252 --> 28:17.533
That's my job.

28:17.553 --> 28:18.835
I am interested in the late cargo race, though.

28:18.855 --> 28:19.336
That's very interesting.

28:19.356 --> 28:20.578
I think you can't stick you by the hand and put on up there.

28:20.558 --> 28:23.603
You gotta get out of Manhattan?

28:23.623 --> 28:37.103
Yeah, I just happened to meet him through my best friend who was working at Random House and managed to have lunch with him one day and with his editor, Gordon Licht.

28:37.123 --> 28:42.852
And I had years before given my friend Carver's first book.

28:42.872 --> 28:48.781
We were at Williams together and said, here, you gotta read this.

28:48.801 --> 28:49.502
You won't believe it.

28:49.482 --> 28:53.287
Carver became a real hero for us.

28:53.367 --> 29:17.616
In a way, not to overstate it, but I think in a way, reading Raymond Carver in 1975, 1976, must have been a little bit like reading In Our Time, or Hemingway's Early Stories, because we were in a period, a really baroque period of meta-fiction, and really academic, post-modern fiction,

29:17.596 --> 29:20.440
writing about writing basically.

29:21.041 --> 29:35.824
John Barth and Hoover and John Hawks and William Gass were sort of the dominant influences, certainly on campus, certainly with

29:36.378 --> 29:37.380
How are we doing?

29:37.480 --> 29:38.342
Enjoying this?

29:38.402 --> 29:39.183
Good, yes.

29:39.624 --> 29:40.505
Thank you.

29:40.606 --> 29:41.627
Okay.

29:41.647 --> 29:44.513
Certainly with the, you know, the sort of smart university crowd.

29:45.434 --> 29:58.077
And, you know, I mean, to parody it was kind of like, you know, typically, you know, a novel was about a writer writing a book, you know, and which his characters rebelled against him, you know.

29:58.097 --> 30:01.002
It was very Baroque and...

30:01.741 --> 30:29.048
self-conscious and to suddenly read will you please be quietly it was just like it was like the reinvigoration of the realistic tradition you know you suddenly thought hey realism isn't necessarily dead um you know and and and beady i think from another side was doing the same thing i mean suddenly she started publishing these in a new yorker these

30:29.028 --> 30:39.221
realistic little narratives about contemporary life, you know?

30:39.301 --> 30:48.593
And that was very inspiring for someone who was more interested in writing about life than about books, I'd say.

30:49.615 --> 30:55.642
So when I got the chance a number of years later to meet Oliver, it was really a thrill.

30:55.663 --> 30:56.824
And he came and...

30:58.643 --> 31:05.446
My friend sent him down to my apartment because he had four or five hours before this reading at Columbia, and everybody else had to go back to work.

31:05.466 --> 31:09.480
I was unemployed at the time, so I was supposed to take way around the city.

31:10.085 --> 31:13.650
But we never managed to get out the door because we just started talking.

31:13.890 --> 31:16.835
We sat down and talked for five hours.

31:16.855 --> 31:19.078
And we started corresponding.

31:19.098 --> 31:24.746
And he knew I wanted to be a writer.

31:24.766 --> 31:28.030
I showed him a few of my stories.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.354
And he suggested that I come up and study with him.

31:30.374 --> 31:32.036
And he was teaching at Syracuse at the time.

31:32.537 --> 31:36.362
And it was a wonderful opportunity for me.

31:36.612 --> 31:41.017
I didn't want to move to Syracuse, but that was exactly what I needed.

31:41.317 --> 31:42.278
Three years.

31:43.199 --> 31:46.022
What were the years?

31:46.102 --> 31:48.184
80 to... Well, 80 to 84.

31:48.385 --> 31:52.249
Basically, Bright Lights was written up there.

31:52.269 --> 31:53.590
Did he read it?

31:54.571 --> 31:57.154
Song of Exile from Syracuse.

31:57.174 --> 31:59.556
Did he read it as a written father?

31:59.576 --> 32:02.940
I wrote Bright Lights very fast.

32:03.292 --> 32:11.985
And Ray was out, I wrote in the summer, in between.

32:12.353 --> 32:15.978
And he was out in Washington, I think, that summer.

32:15.998 --> 32:19.923
So he didn't read it until it was finished.

32:20.223 --> 32:26.572
But he gave me a wonderful blog for it, and I think he liked it.

32:26.592 --> 32:33.300
You came out as a paperback to this one, right?

32:33.461 --> 32:34.462
Yeah.

32:34.642 --> 32:40.690
You know, the feeling was that nobody in my generation read.

32:40.670 --> 32:49.324
I think they thought, and by the way, I'm writing a new book about that.

32:49.444 --> 32:55.874
Well, first novels at that time weren't selling.

32:55.914 --> 32:59.480
The wisdom was that no one wanted to read a first novel.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.844
No one certainly was interested in New York City.

33:01.884 --> 33:05.510
Nobody, my generation, read.

33:06.752 --> 33:07.453
So the, as a sort of

33:09.155 --> 33:13.545
a desperate stab at reaching an audience, they tracked me into doing this

33:14.048 --> 33:25.498
trade paperback original, which I was very nervous about.

33:25.598 --> 33:29.882
But in the wake of the success of Bright Lights, it's hard to argue.

33:29.902 --> 33:40.292
A few months after it was published, it was selling 25,000, 30,000 copies a week for a long time.

33:40.312 --> 33:42.093
It was great.

33:42.193 --> 33:44.055
And I think maybe I reached

33:44.035 --> 34:00.607
That critical mass, because I was in paperback, I mean, when the word of mouth was carrying this book along, I think a lot of people who might not have bought it in hardcover did.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.512
There it was, it was $6.95 or something.

34:05.416 --> 34:10.122
I couldn't possibly wish for it to be otherwise.

34:10.262 --> 34:14.867
The book sold, you know, a million copies.

34:14.887 --> 34:19.453
The sports writer was the same thing.

34:19.473 --> 34:23.418
You saw Bell a couple years ago.

34:23.718 --> 34:25.100
The sports writer was in the same series.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.361
The Bell Lights was the first.

34:26.932 --> 34:35.607
Bellas is the first vintage contemporary of the sports writer.

34:35.627 --> 34:40.695
There was not a big first edition.

34:40.715 --> 34:45.143
There's one reason.

34:45.832 --> 34:50.357
I can't remember if they published 5,000 or 6,000.

34:50.377 --> 34:51.778
It's not many of them.

34:51.878 --> 34:54.060
And a bunch of them disintegrated.

34:54.421 --> 34:56.483
Really, it's a very good book to find.

34:56.643 --> 35:03.550
My editor, Alan Peacock, is that the first part, like Timbers, and he's going to FedEx it up to me.

35:03.630 --> 35:07.033
And he's going to sign it, and he's going to ask me to sign it properly.

35:07.053 --> 35:09.015
And he'd look for me and for him.

35:09.095 --> 35:11.217
In any case, yeah.

35:11.578 --> 35:15.822
Well, yeah, he found that one, you know, in the first British event in London.

35:15.802 --> 35:28.539
Well, I'll tell you how to find it if you ever... The easy way to spot it is that all subsequent editions have a page of blurbs from the reviews right on the inside.

35:28.579 --> 35:33.005
And the only one that doesn't is the first edition.

35:33.105 --> 35:35.569
I don't know if it makes sense.

35:35.589 --> 35:36.931
There weren't any blurbs.

35:37.011 --> 35:42.098
Well, yeah, we had a couple on the cover, from Raymond Carver and Thomas McBlane.

35:42.118 --> 35:43.159
But we didn't...

35:43.139 --> 35:49.575
You didn't have anything on the inside except the title page.

35:49.595 --> 35:57.555
Well, I just, I don't know, I just kind of read everything.

35:57.575 --> 35:59.460
When I discover a

35:59.440 --> 36:05.428
A writer that I admire, I tend to take his sentences apart a little bit and see how they work.

36:05.488 --> 36:09.934
I mean, it's confidentiality as much as it is appreciated.

36:10.315 --> 36:20.368
I mean, recently, after Harold Brodke died, I went back and looked at his work to see if it was as interesting as I thought when I first started reading his stories.

36:21.817 --> 36:28.883
He's an interesting technician, you know, and I kind of really studied his senses.

36:29.424 --> 36:30.324
Yeah.

36:30.485 --> 36:32.206
Wow, that's not easy.

36:32.226 --> 36:35.289
He was a prickly guy.

36:36.270 --> 36:38.171
Really?

36:38.251 --> 36:40.553
Yeah, very nice.

36:40.653 --> 36:43.896
Nice man.

36:43.936 --> 36:51.823
Most people who wrote about him, though, found him endlessly second-guessing and writing them and saying, what are you writing, versus how...

36:51.803 --> 36:54.687
What's your schedule?

36:54.767 --> 37:01.876
Oh, I'm supposed to be in my room about 10, 10, 15.

37:01.916 --> 37:03.578
Can we shoot a couple pictures in?

37:03.598 --> 37:03.858
Yeah.

37:03.878 --> 37:04.900
I have plenty of stuff.

37:05.320 --> 37:05.461
Really?

37:05.721 --> 37:07.143
Yeah.

37:07.483 --> 37:09.065
Anything else you want to add?

37:09.085 --> 37:12.189
Are you going to say one more?

37:12.209 --> 37:13.090
You're going to add something.

37:13.170 --> 37:13.971
I don't know.

37:14.913 --> 37:17.156
No, I mean, I've got a lot.

37:17.216 --> 37:18.317
Have you got a...

37:19.124 --> 37:25.276
I want to ask you what you're working on.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.418
What's next?

37:26.899 --> 37:29.144
Yeah, it is.

37:29.244 --> 37:37.099
Actually, I wanted to say that because I don't...

37:37.079 --> 37:40.746
I want to read when the next novel comes out.

37:41.087 --> 37:59.442
Well, this clearly was a reaction to... I started to tell you earlier that while I was between drafts of this novel, I...

37:59.422 --> 38:08.032
I'm kind of struggling to figure out what it might be, how I might shape it, realizing I hadn't got it where I wanted it.

38:09.694 --> 38:15.562
And I just put it aside and wrote what turned out to be another book.

38:15.582 --> 38:17.824
And it started out as a novella and it just kept going.

38:18.265 --> 38:22.510
And it is...

38:22.490 --> 38:27.819
It's a book set in New York again.

38:31.805 --> 38:34.870
Well, I did in this book.

38:35.491 --> 38:37.414
I just think I'll always go back to New York.

38:37.535 --> 38:39.638
I think I'll leave New York a lot.

38:40.293 --> 38:43.519
Okay, but I think I'll always go back to it.

38:44.080 --> 38:52.655
So this novel is a relatively short, relatively comic novel set in New York.

38:52.836 --> 38:59.668
And as I said earlier, I'm not sure where it fits in the plan.

38:59.648 --> 39:05.014
Certainly, its characters are older than the characters of my previous New York novels.

39:05.034 --> 39:07.417
They're in their 30s instead of their 20s.

39:08.038 --> 39:17.168
They're a little more battered by life than my earlier characters, and they're maybe just a little bit wiser.

39:18.270 --> 39:20.512
It's currently called Model Behavior.

39:20.552 --> 39:24.337
I'm not sure if that will remain the title.

39:24.357 --> 39:25.538
I always hesitate to...

39:25.940 --> 39:38.032
I don't need to mention working titles since they often change, but... Oddly, it is narrated in... It's written in short sections.

39:38.072 --> 39:41.836
Some of them are just a short paragraph.

39:41.896 --> 39:46.661
And some are first person and some are third person.

39:46.841 --> 39:51.205
And a couple are... A few are even second person, I think.

39:52.045 --> 40:12.973
You don't need this on tape, do we?
