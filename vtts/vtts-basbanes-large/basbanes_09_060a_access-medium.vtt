00:06.781 --> 00:09.524
Just don't even think about it.

00:09.564 --> 00:13.548
I'm going to keep an eye on it just in case.

00:13.568 --> 00:20.355
All right.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.737
Congratulations on your book.

00:23.518 --> 00:24.059
Read the novel.

00:26.861 --> 00:27.142
Thank you.

00:27.923 --> 00:28.803
This is really amazing.

00:29.024 --> 00:32.367
Publishers Weekly has an interviewer's guideline.

00:32.937 --> 00:51.273
I've only done about 850 author interviews over the years, but if one of these questions seem really foolish, like mentors and publishing history and dates, that's because they want agents and stuff.

00:51.293 --> 00:51.773
Okay.

00:51.793 --> 01:01.662
But we will get to the stuff that certainly interests me, but this is T.W., and they are interested in the...

01:02.013 --> 01:04.616
Do you like if we just do the basic biographical stuff for us?

01:04.636 --> 01:04.856
Not at all.

01:05.096 --> 01:06.098
No, it's going to be fine.

01:06.438 --> 01:09.762
Why don't you just give me a quick biographical?

01:09.802 --> 01:11.684
I was born in, I'm in my 50s.

01:13.426 --> 01:17.390
I'm trying to clap so high.

01:17.751 --> 01:25.359
Born and grew up in Michigan, Fort Michigan, and my father was an auto worker.

01:26.441 --> 01:27.662
Let me guess, a Chevy plant?

01:27.922 --> 01:29.404
Chevy plant.

01:29.722 --> 01:31.945
I ended up working at a Chevy plant myself.

01:31.965 --> 01:32.887
I guess that, too.

01:34.309 --> 01:35.410
I had a terrible childhood.

01:39.196 --> 01:45.926
I suppose my parents were out of the hallway, and they split when I was an infant, and I grew up with my father.

01:45.986 --> 01:48.430
Did you see Echoes and Alex?

01:48.450 --> 01:56.862
My first novel was pretty much I was out of the background, and Partly, a few friends I had.

01:57.243 --> 01:58.665
That was wonderful for me to consider.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.059
Yeah, oh, thank you.

02:01.561 --> 02:01.661
Yeah.

02:01.681 --> 02:03.523
I read first, by the way.

02:04.164 --> 02:04.364
Yeah.

02:05.065 --> 02:06.507
You know, I did take a little time.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.949
Do you mind my interrupting?

02:08.009 --> 02:08.690
No, no, no.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.392
I didn't read this one first.

02:10.412 --> 02:16.839
I'm glad I did, just because I kind of missed having this one in a sequence, you know.

02:16.859 --> 02:16.959
Yeah.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.987
Because I'd really like to... Truth of it, I think this book I really wanted to write first was Novemberfest.

02:23.107 --> 02:23.467
Really?

02:23.688 --> 02:28.213
I mean, it was... Well, just to back up...

02:28.649 --> 02:29.690
That would have been impossible.

02:29.930 --> 02:30.912
Oh, yeah, I couldn't do it.

02:30.972 --> 02:33.435
Yeah, I mean, it's something that came later.

02:33.455 --> 02:40.323
But I left school, left high school, lived in the Army.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.725
Didn't you drop out as Alex did?

02:42.866 --> 02:43.246
I did.

02:43.506 --> 02:46.009
Well, actually, I was compelled to leave.

02:46.870 --> 02:50.254
I was kicked out of high school, falsely charged.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.816
I was billy of many things.

02:52.176 --> 02:55.580
So you were over-kicked out of high school.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.002
I was over-kicked out of high school.

02:57.488 --> 03:07.256
Well, I was a kid who had a lot of problems in high school, and I've been arrested many times, and I did time in a juvenile detention home.

03:07.717 --> 03:08.618
Really?

03:09.198 --> 03:12.401
No, no, I didn't go to the state formatory.

03:13.322 --> 03:20.067
Just the county detention home, Tennessee County.

03:20.928 --> 03:24.311
Back into high school then.

03:24.591 --> 03:26.753
In fact, I was kind of trying to get my life

03:27.560 --> 03:34.187
asking an order, but I went to a football game and a fight broke out somewhere near me and I wasn't involved with it.

03:34.207 --> 03:37.431
It was just kids in a fight, high school kids.

03:37.451 --> 03:47.982
I was called into Brentsville's office the following Monday and suspended from school until I could not return until I came in with a parent.

03:48.342 --> 03:50.284
My father had already died.

03:51.345 --> 03:57.432
He was a suicide when we were living together and so I went to live with

03:57.749 --> 03:59.712
Did you discover that?

03:59.732 --> 04:08.966
I did, you know, the Cougars were together, and I'm an old school when I was in Italy, when we should have been working second shift.

04:09.607 --> 04:13.272
So really quite a few autobiographies of the Lekalus in that book.

04:14.154 --> 04:17.238
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.682
Did you steal 14 cards?

04:20.343 --> 04:21.084
I did.

04:21.285 --> 04:21.725
Really?

04:22.266 --> 04:23.328
Did you get nailed for that?

04:24.630 --> 04:24.870
Yeah.

04:25.711 --> 04:28.275
In much the same way that our friends .

04:29.016 --> 04:29.958
Yeah.

04:29.978 --> 04:34.164
Yeah, that's pretty much streamlined on a black craft for a novel.

04:35.326 --> 04:37.269
I shouldn't say it was easy to write.

04:37.369 --> 04:43.839
It came automatically, but I'm sure you would know and appreciate it.

04:43.979 --> 04:48.526
I didn't even know if I had a camera and recorded things.

04:48.546 --> 04:51.651
But I did draw, certainly in some film members.

04:53.048 --> 04:56.933
But going to Germany and going into the army, a 17-year-old getting kicked out of high school.

04:56.953 --> 05:03.262
Well, to finish this little story, I was suspended by the high school and had to return then when they brought up.

05:03.282 --> 05:17.841
They called in the head of the Board of Education for the city, and the principal, they had this little hearing, and the principal said, I saw this, I'm sitting on the 50-yard line, I saw this young man leap over rows of people trying to hit someone.

05:18.817 --> 05:22.782
It simply wasn't true, and I said, no, I didn't do it.

05:22.802 --> 05:23.804
The fact that it is for you?

05:24.344 --> 05:25.245
Yeah, I guess so.

05:25.466 --> 05:29.791
Had you already been, I mean, did you already have a record at that particular point?

05:29.851 --> 05:30.612
Yeah, yeah.

05:30.733 --> 05:34.277
I mean, I see this guy in there saying, just don't do anything.

05:34.297 --> 05:35.158
You're out of here forever.

05:35.399 --> 05:37.161
I suspect this is probably the same guy.

05:39.364 --> 05:39.905
Yes.

05:39.925 --> 05:45.151
When you want him to go play sports, and you have to go to the theater, you know, talking about... Yeah, I do.

05:45.332 --> 05:46.253
I'm just coming back.

05:46.273 --> 05:47.895
Yeah, unless I'm 72 at this point.

05:49.006 --> 05:53.393
That year, I was suspended permanently.

05:54.134 --> 05:56.978
There was no option of returning.

05:57.298 --> 05:58.721
Your father was deceased at this point?

05:58.741 --> 05:58.941
Yeah.

06:01.024 --> 06:08.535
And I went with a friend of mine who was going to Richmond Navy.

06:08.776 --> 06:10.618
I was hanging out in town.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.580
I had nothing else to do.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.442
With whom were you living?

06:13.623 --> 06:16.587
I was living with my stepmother.

06:16.747 --> 06:18.490
My father previously been married.

06:18.925 --> 06:23.231
But before that, back to America.

06:23.251 --> 06:27.236
And a friend was enlisting in the Navy.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.980
It was an Army-Navy recruiting station.

06:30.701 --> 06:35.307
There was the Navy guy and an Army sergeant sitting at an adjacent desk.

06:35.427 --> 06:41.655
And all I was waiting for was kind of go through some part of his enlisting paperwork.

06:41.675 --> 06:45.140
The Army sergeant said, excuse me.

06:46.382 --> 06:48.865
And I started, it was kind of an answer.

06:48.946 --> 06:50.749
for something to do for me.

06:51.850 --> 06:53.232
And worked out.

06:53.733 --> 06:55.375
I was leading my arms plan.

06:55.395 --> 06:56.657
Had a good time in the Army.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.621
Ended up in Germany.

06:59.641 --> 07:03.947
Still 17 when I arrived in Germany after my basic training.

07:03.967 --> 07:11.098
And the Army in Germany was interesting.

07:11.118 --> 07:13.641
You know, the Army gave me a kind of solid base.

07:15.484 --> 07:17.687
I was really very fond of the whole experience.

07:18.275 --> 07:19.477
Well, I grew up.

07:19.497 --> 07:21.660
I mean, that's where I kind of went pretty much to school.

07:23.162 --> 07:30.593
You said something, I grew up, I would gather in every respect, but it's a luxury.

07:31.535 --> 07:40.468
Mostly, but I suspect from what you said, this was a book you wanted, a variation thereof, a book you wanted to have done first.

07:41.189 --> 07:45.936
I suspect that there was probably a similar kind of relationship with the German woman.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.312
You don't have to answer that at all.

07:49.872 --> 07:54.436
I remember when you were saying I grew up there.

07:54.456 --> 07:56.698
I thought I'd just check the tape, okay?

07:56.718 --> 07:57.779
You don't mind.

07:57.819 --> 08:03.905
You can never be too careful, can't you?

08:06.627 --> 08:07.007
Okay.

08:07.548 --> 08:09.750
Okay, so you got out of the Army when?

08:10.871 --> 08:16.716
Got in the Army in 1955, went in in 1952, for three years.

08:16.915 --> 08:19.878
So you went in 1952 at the age of three?

08:19.898 --> 08:20.339
Sixteen.

08:20.359 --> 08:21.460
I just turned 17.

08:21.520 --> 08:27.086
So, how old are you right now?

08:27.406 --> 08:28.427
Sixty-nine.

08:28.928 --> 08:30.950
Okay, you were born, I think you said 30?

08:30.970 --> 08:31.591
Thirty-five.

08:32.111 --> 08:35.175
Thirty-five, okay.

08:35.355 --> 08:37.838
You know, what am I asking these questions?

08:37.858 --> 08:38.078
Not at all.

08:38.098 --> 08:44.985
I got out of the Army, had written away to schools when I was still in Germany, see if I could get into college.

08:45.286 --> 08:45.606
I had a GED.

08:46.413 --> 08:50.679
Why is it that I seem to know all these things, having read these books?

08:50.699 --> 08:55.926
Those things keep talking up, don't they?

08:56.046 --> 09:05.659
I feel a certain attachment for the GED, because I want to support that intervention in a way.

09:06.340 --> 09:14.952
But I got accepted at Michigan State, oddly enough, and was an underachiever, and an honored student, and so on.

09:15.286 --> 09:21.013
By that point in my life, I work very hard.

09:21.454 --> 09:24.198
I'm pitching the paper in Lansing, by the way.

09:24.618 --> 09:25.079
Oh, are you?

09:25.099 --> 09:25.379
Oh, good.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.981
I'm going to try and get this.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.204
It's one of my kind of kids.

09:29.224 --> 09:30.526
I think it's about 150,000 circulation.

09:31.687 --> 09:31.868
Yeah.

09:31.928 --> 09:33.269
I was here a couple of years ago.

09:33.650 --> 09:34.651
I think I'll pitch you.

09:35.132 --> 09:36.033
Oh, good.

09:36.353 --> 09:39.978
I'll try to help out of the game.

09:39.998 --> 09:41.580
It helps you, helps me.

09:42.121 --> 09:42.982
But go ahead.

09:43.342 --> 09:44.584
Well, anyway...

09:44.783 --> 09:47.107
So what did you major in?

09:47.127 --> 09:50.432
Actually, I majored in landscape architecture.

09:50.452 --> 09:53.296
No thoughts at all at this point about the calling.

09:53.396 --> 09:54.758
Well, that began to happen.

09:54.778 --> 10:03.091
I began to really discover that I enjoyed writing papers for classes, and I discovered that I was good at it.

10:04.453 --> 10:05.254
And I liked to read.

10:05.275 --> 10:07.818
I've been a reader since I was very young.

10:07.838 --> 10:09.261
You were sure of all the difficulties?

10:10.002 --> 10:11.744
Yeah, I would escape into novels.

10:12.405 --> 10:13.407
I grew up reading

10:14.652 --> 10:20.299
people like Nelson Paltren and who is this?

10:20.319 --> 10:22.842
A Chicago writer.

10:25.125 --> 10:31.413
I think we always have, I always know.

10:32.054 --> 10:35.198
No, I don't think I'm from Chicago.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.662
I thought I'm from New York, but he made that from Chicago.

10:39.784 --> 10:42.868
That makes my impression of everything I've ever read of.

10:43.148 --> 10:43.849
It's not 400.

10:44.065 --> 10:46.268
There are many of them.

10:46.328 --> 10:48.932
James T. Farrell.

10:49.132 --> 10:49.893
James T. Farrell.

10:51.656 --> 10:55.141
Yeah, a lot of writers from Chicago.

10:55.541 --> 10:56.723
A bunch of writers.

10:56.843 --> 11:02.551
A bunch of fine writers out of that area.

11:02.911 --> 11:11.203
In any case, back to school I discovered I liked to write papers and did well and liked to read.

11:11.572 --> 11:19.959
wandered off to the English department and took a writing course and just kind of captured me.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.340
How far are you into this?

11:21.881 --> 11:22.821
Sophomore or junior?

11:22.841 --> 11:24.763
I was close to being a senior.

11:24.923 --> 11:25.283
Really?

11:26.104 --> 11:28.626
So did you get your degree in the landscape of architecture?

11:28.646 --> 11:29.567
No, I got it in English.

11:30.468 --> 11:32.810
Were you able to pile up enough credit?

11:32.910 --> 11:35.712
No, well, the thing was I was in what was called the Honors College.

11:36.193 --> 11:41.477
There was a new institution in Michigan State which said that

11:42.115 --> 11:44.498
Credits in any one area did not count.

11:44.518 --> 11:53.829
If you were admitted into this Honors College program, you could study anything you wanted to, get your degree to identify.

11:53.929 --> 11:57.834
I quickly scrambled and took, I dropped architecture finally.

11:57.854 --> 12:06.624
And I did prepare to go over to Ann Arbor to continue and become an actual architect.

12:06.644 --> 12:08.967
And I mean, I loved doing that.

12:08.987 --> 12:09.928
I was very good at it.

12:09.968 --> 12:11.650
I finished drafting in the Army.

12:11.933 --> 12:41.485
But it was kind of a situation where I was, I'd done all that work, all that architectural work, but I really fell involved with writing and reading and scrambled very quickly to summer school and took a bunch of courses in English and graduated with a degree in English in 1959.

12:44.030 --> 12:48.775
Then, just to finish the biographical kind of sketch.

12:49.736 --> 12:56.564
Actually, I went back to Europe for a while, eight or ten months.

12:56.584 --> 12:57.025
You're still single?

12:57.305 --> 12:58.326
Still single, yeah.

12:59.027 --> 13:02.251
Came back and worked in the factory.

13:02.411 --> 13:04.613
I worked at Chevrolet Assembly.

13:05.074 --> 13:06.435
Say you moved to Detroit?

13:06.535 --> 13:07.096
To Flint.

13:08.338 --> 13:11.421
I was in Flint.

13:12.515 --> 13:13.876
Worked at Chevrolet Assembly.

13:13.936 --> 13:15.498
Worked at AC Spark Club.

13:15.558 --> 13:22.885
Worked at, back when I first got out of the Army, I worked at Buick.

13:23.405 --> 13:26.548
Worked on the line at Chevrolet.

13:26.568 --> 13:32.634
And then went off to, went west.

13:34.776 --> 13:36.958
This is kind of a big road.

13:36.978 --> 13:38.920
I ended up in San Francisco.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.442
Lived there for six months or so.

13:42.569 --> 13:43.951
Are we in the 60s yet?

13:44.591 --> 13:49.758
Yeah, we're into early 60s.

13:50.359 --> 13:55.044
Returned, took a job then as a technical writer in Denver.

13:55.064 --> 13:58.789
Worked for Martin Marietta Company.

13:58.889 --> 14:00.771
Had my degree in English.

14:00.791 --> 14:02.413
And got that job.

14:02.934 --> 14:10.703
And then left Denver and went to Iowa City.

14:10.884 --> 14:11.985
Enrolled in graduate school.

14:12.691 --> 14:15.314
I spent a semester there.

14:16.876 --> 14:17.217
Do they?

14:17.437 --> 14:20.321
Tell me these two places.

14:20.341 --> 14:22.503
I know these stories.

14:24.186 --> 14:34.859
I went on to... I wasn't crazy about being in graduate school, and it's New York.

14:35.420 --> 14:41.247
And I had a girlfriend that was living in New York.

14:42.172 --> 15:05.814
went to New York in, whatever, 1962, and worked there as an architectural draftsman, and ended up getting married, and then returning to the University of Iowa in 1963 to finish out an MFA program.

15:06.975 --> 15:08.697
He was at the workshop, right?

15:08.717 --> 15:10.879
Yeah, in the Writers' Workshop.

15:11.770 --> 15:24.101
My classmates, among others, were Ray Carter, a classmate I'm here to do, a bunch of good people, Barthi Murkaji.

15:25.862 --> 15:26.362
Did you?

15:26.382 --> 15:28.204
Yeah, she was a classmate here.

15:29.345 --> 15:38.353
Yeah, yeah, a classmate who married her, they were both students there.

15:38.373 --> 15:41.035
A bunch of other things going on to do nice things.

15:42.078 --> 15:47.624
Um, that was, I began to publish my first story as a student.

15:47.684 --> 15:50.527
And that evening post took a story.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.909
Can you remember the name of the story?

15:52.929 --> 15:59.176
Uh, the name of the story, my name was the story, was The Unspeakable.

16:00.518 --> 16:05.243
And when it came out, and no one told me that this would happen, it had a different title.

16:05.563 --> 16:07.385
And the title was The Survivors.

16:08.726 --> 16:10.448
Um, and it was a, uh,

16:11.879 --> 16:18.469
It was an invented story about a person who gets wounded in Korea when I've never been.

16:18.609 --> 16:19.451
It was my first public story.

16:19.471 --> 16:25.861
And did you more or less have this off on your own, and it'll be your first try, and you'll experience it?

16:25.941 --> 16:26.982
No, that's not.

16:27.303 --> 16:30.388
I've sent out many stories before I sent.

16:30.468 --> 16:32.531
We had felt this thing of rejection.

16:32.691 --> 16:33.392
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:33.412 --> 16:36.077
Yeah, it was very nice to have something taken.

16:36.577 --> 16:40.283
And this was what year when you published your first book?

16:40.364 --> 16:45.271
I guess it was published in 1965.

16:45.291 --> 16:45.391
Yeah.

16:45.411 --> 16:49.597
You don't want to make it.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.941
The chronology is important here.

16:52.562 --> 17:00.593
Anyway, having two children by then very quickly, 64 and 65, my first two children were born.

17:01.875 --> 17:05.520
And we moved down to the family.

17:05.540 --> 17:05.761
Sure.

17:05.781 --> 17:09.967
My oldest, his name after me, his name is Ted.

17:09.987 --> 17:10.287
Ted Jr.

17:10.756 --> 17:15.001
And my second is Hannah.

17:16.242 --> 17:20.427
All three of my kids are in college right now.

17:20.447 --> 17:22.129
Ted is working at MSA at Emerson.

17:22.149 --> 17:26.113
Yeah, well, there's a woman who works at my college.

17:26.194 --> 17:32.621
There's a woman over there, Diane Daniel, who called me.

17:32.781 --> 17:35.464
Are you going to be doing anything in 10 weeks now?

17:36.473 --> 17:39.156
I said, you know, I am.

17:39.257 --> 17:42.200
Believe it or not, I said, I'm doing something for P.W.

17:42.321 --> 17:44.183
And I guess she does your son.

17:44.563 --> 17:49.290
Oh, oh.

17:51.272 --> 17:52.914
You will have something for the wedding.

17:53.515 --> 17:54.476
So she'll handle this.

17:54.496 --> 17:59.302
We'll probably put her on page one, actually.

17:59.322 --> 18:03.288
Not the front page of the news section, but the entertainment section.

18:03.328 --> 18:03.988
Yeah.

18:04.329 --> 18:04.689
Anyway, I'm sorry.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.991
You gave me the three names, right?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.719
Ted, Anna, and Steven.

18:08.739 --> 18:09.159
Okay.

18:09.179 --> 18:10.221
And they think what?

18:10.321 --> 18:11.722
Ted is at Emerson, I guess.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.665
Ted is at Emerson, working on the MFA.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.307
Anna is at Cornell.

18:16.688 --> 18:21.074
His foundation is called the VMA, the Doctor of Musical Art.

18:21.454 --> 18:23.597
She's a composer.

18:23.877 --> 18:26.260
And my son, Steven, is a senior.

18:26.660 --> 18:27.782
With a PH or a B?

18:29.103 --> 18:30.425
A PH.

18:31.726 --> 18:34.830
With a V. With a V. He's a senior at the University of Colorado.

18:36.143 --> 18:42.210
and return to the narrative there.

18:43.211 --> 18:45.334
Don't worry, I'll get you back on track.

18:46.015 --> 18:50.180
Don't get mad at me.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.464
My wife's family... This is Janet, of course.

18:53.804 --> 18:54.565
No, it's not Janet.

18:55.246 --> 18:58.309
No, this is Sharon.

18:59.831 --> 19:03.596
Janet is my domestic significant other.

19:04.136 --> 19:04.817
My wife's father.

19:05.388 --> 19:07.670
in 1986, brain tumor.

19:07.690 --> 19:15.478
Anyway, we have a number of books dedicated to Jeff, that's correct.

19:15.918 --> 19:18.861
Yeah, the last two, yeah.

19:19.682 --> 19:35.277
Anyway, back getting out of Iowa in 1965, my wife's parents had a farmhouse that they didn't occupy in Connecticut, and there were two children

19:35.493 --> 19:41.703
I kind of lived there for a year, just as a kind of transition, trying to find a way in the world.

19:42.864 --> 19:55.905
And we did that, and I wrote out, you know, sent letters to feel like it was a teaching job, because it was what people were doing, and I never really anticipated being a teacher.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.869
But you could get jobs through the mail at the time.

19:59.590 --> 20:03.897
In fact, I was offered a job at a school in Indiana,

20:05.648 --> 20:10.012
DePaul, something like that, where Dan Quayle went to college.

20:10.373 --> 20:11.674
DePaul, at the University.

20:11.694 --> 20:13.636
Dan, Paul, and they offered me a job.

20:13.656 --> 20:20.443
They called up at the last minute and said, the person we were hiring you to replace has changed his mind.

20:20.503 --> 20:21.664
We have to withdraw a job off.

20:22.966 --> 20:30.373
And my wife, Sharon, my first choice at the University of New Hampshire, she said, why don't you have a job?

20:31.130 --> 20:33.573
and just call New Hampshire back.

20:33.673 --> 20:46.749
Pippa turned me down, said it's a great answer about a job, and I said, no, no, you don't need to call the college of math.

20:46.769 --> 20:47.089
She said, giant!

20:47.109 --> 20:47.330
Okay, okay.

20:47.350 --> 20:50.954
So I got on the phone call the University of New Hampshire in August.

20:52.416 --> 20:57.542
And, you know, not knowing where we were going to be going, you know, what's going to happen.

20:58.282 --> 21:03.927
and talked to a new chairman and he said, can you come and teach, you know, three weeks from now?

21:04.308 --> 21:05.309
We could use you.

21:05.329 --> 21:08.812
And I said, how can you get there?

21:11.754 --> 21:16.119
So off we went and we packed up and moved to New Hampshire.

21:16.519 --> 21:16.859
Here?

21:17.059 --> 21:23.666
Well, over in the Durham area, from the University of Lake Tahoe, 15 miles inland.

21:24.426 --> 21:26.348
And I stayed there.

21:26.851 --> 21:32.498
I was finally tenured as a professor and published books.

21:32.618 --> 21:36.522
I had a third shot as a TV supporter.

21:38.825 --> 21:42.409
I stayed there until 1980.

21:42.429 --> 21:46.774
Why did you leave?

21:46.814 --> 21:50.618
That's a pertinent question in light of the novel, certainly.

21:50.638 --> 21:54.563
Actually, I left because my first novel had come out.

21:55.117 --> 22:01.705
It's done quite well, having great reviews, and it's been very well financially.

22:01.725 --> 22:05.971
And I was maybe filled with sense of false fear.

22:06.231 --> 22:10.096
But I wanted to really make a run as being a writer on a full-time basis.

22:11.978 --> 22:21.630
And I resigned and took an advance to write a new model, which was the Trudy Tech.

22:22.606 --> 22:24.948
Although, what year is it together?

22:24.968 --> 22:29.592
Actually, it was in 1978.

22:29.712 --> 22:33.856
Okay, so the first novel was 72, right?

22:33.876 --> 22:34.377
72.

22:34.637 --> 22:43.025
Then I had another novel, a little novel, came out in 76 called The German Affair, which is just as well forgotten.

22:44.186 --> 22:48.209
And then I ran a message.

22:48.409 --> 22:52.393
And then I got into writing this novel called The True Testament.

22:52.745 --> 22:58.312
In fact, what happened is I've taken my oldest son.

22:59.053 --> 23:05.260
We were both hockey boss, and he was a young kid playing hockey.

23:05.280 --> 23:10.927
And we'd go to the University of New Hampshire's hockey games, and we got into the national playoff.

23:11.307 --> 23:18.376
And we went out to Detroit to see the treat for the father's son to go off.

23:18.396 --> 23:21.840
And when we just landed in Detroit, they were in the midst

23:23.052 --> 23:28.639
this strain of kidnapping to kids, just my son's age, but above the result.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.944
And it was such a powerful thing.

23:33.004 --> 23:44.978
I was looking for something powerful to write about, and I meant to do a non-fiction account of the impact of those child adoption.

23:44.998 --> 23:47.421
Poor kids were about to have murdered me.

23:47.441 --> 23:48.743
Did they ever saw it?

23:48.763 --> 23:50.144
No, they never did.

23:50.405 --> 23:50.925
Were they real?

23:51.226 --> 23:52.247
Were they serial?

23:52.267 --> 23:52.367
Yeah.

23:52.718 --> 24:00.789
I can't remember the time sequence of cover, so it was, I don't know, 15, 17 months altogether.

24:00.909 --> 24:06.878
And the kids were kept for a period of time.

24:06.978 --> 24:15.189
One of them was kept for a couple months before the girl's body was found.

24:15.209 --> 24:16.251
Yeah, yeah.

24:16.351 --> 24:19.435
So she disappeared walking up from school or something,

24:20.242 --> 24:24.108
Two months later, I thought I was trying to write along the interstate.

24:24.128 --> 24:25.089
So somebody had kept her?

24:25.109 --> 24:29.375
Someone kept her for that period of time, yeah.

24:29.695 --> 24:30.477
Yeah, it was.

24:30.897 --> 24:35.364
It was overwhelming and stunning kind of thing.

24:35.444 --> 24:47.080
And so I proposed a book contract to my publisher, which was... I'd gone from Random House to Thomasville with my editor.

24:47.441 --> 24:48.342
This is Jim Tillman.

24:49.233 --> 25:03.146
He was my editor at Random House, and he left Random House and started his own internet called Thomas.

25:03.526 --> 25:05.308
Yeah, he became Thomas.

25:05.488 --> 25:06.449
He was Simon & Schuster.

25:06.769 --> 25:10.092
In print.

25:10.393 --> 25:11.414
Yeah, in print.

25:12.515 --> 25:17.299
And Jim gave me what at the time was a Hanson advance.

25:18.072 --> 25:25.881
and support, and I left my job at New Hampshire and decided to go for that book and be a professional.

25:27.723 --> 25:28.203
It didn't work.

25:28.223 --> 25:30.446
They didn't catch the killer.

25:30.566 --> 25:32.768
And I probably went to do that.

25:34.170 --> 25:37.253
This was going to be a nonfiction book.

25:37.273 --> 25:40.477
Yeah, a nonfiction account.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.320
You have to kind of follow this as a journal.

25:43.469 --> 25:45.811
We moved out there with my family.

25:45.831 --> 25:47.473
We moved to Michigan.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.076
So you were really shooting crafts then, weren't you?

25:50.256 --> 25:51.537
Oh, yeah.

25:51.717 --> 25:52.078
Yeah.

25:52.558 --> 25:58.464
Well, I thought even if they didn't, I could write a meaningful book.

25:58.745 --> 26:00.346
And I worked on it and worked on it.

26:00.446 --> 26:02.709
And it was nonfiction.

26:03.009 --> 26:04.771
And I reconstructed the crime.

26:05.512 --> 26:08.274
And I worked with the police task force.

26:08.435 --> 26:09.596
And I did all that stuff.

26:09.616 --> 26:10.877
And I wrote it on the cop part.

26:11.667 --> 26:19.875
I had a tape recorder and I'd take interviews with all the family members, the brothers and parents and sisters.

26:20.155 --> 26:20.316
Wow.

26:20.736 --> 26:26.302
How much time did you spend that?

26:26.682 --> 26:36.452
Finally, I spent about six months there doing that research and then reconstructing and coming up with the first draft manuscript.

26:36.472 --> 26:40.035
I spent the next two years, three years.

26:40.816 --> 26:41.657
I could never make it work.

26:42.515 --> 26:44.557
That's the point.

26:44.637 --> 26:45.858
What was the working title of it?

26:50.122 --> 26:53.646
I called it, my working title was the Woodward Corridor.

26:56.128 --> 26:59.312
Woodward Avenue was sort of the vein.

27:00.573 --> 27:03.255
It's business, isn't it?

27:04.517 --> 27:04.677
Yeah.

27:04.837 --> 27:06.559
It's business.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.961
I know what you're telling me here.

27:09.329 --> 27:19.360
It's easier to recall it now from this removal of 10 years or something like that, but it's something to invest yourself into a project like that.

27:20.621 --> 27:22.584
And how did you make the decision?

27:22.684 --> 27:25.487
Did Jim make the decision?

27:25.747 --> 27:26.668
I did it all on my own.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.630
This is going no way, right?

27:28.871 --> 27:32.054
Well, Jim, I ended up with a 1,300-page manuscript.

27:32.535 --> 27:33.516
And you submitted it?

27:33.936 --> 27:35.998
No, but Jim insisted on seeing it.

27:36.018 --> 27:39.302
I can't say I haven't made it work.

27:39.603 --> 27:47.855
of course, bonding or in touch with the state policeman who was in charge of the investigation.

27:48.076 --> 27:55.306
By that time, he became a captain in the state police, a man named Robert Robertson.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.209
He would call me once in a while.

27:57.229 --> 27:58.871
I would call him.

27:59.072 --> 28:00.794
I would hear from people in jail.

28:02.016 --> 28:06.943
It would have gotten out that I was supposed to know all the inside dope about this crime.

28:07.224 --> 28:08.766
I'd seen a lot of stuff,

28:09.218 --> 28:10.620
They didn't show me everything.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.083
How close were they in the place?

28:13.103 --> 28:14.765
I don't think so.

28:14.785 --> 28:23.355
They did, but it was so generic in general that it would have fit any numbers.

28:25.377 --> 28:28.321
And I ended up with this manuscript which didn't work.

28:28.781 --> 28:33.787
And Jim finally said, but then he paid me the full advantage.

28:33.807 --> 28:35.309
He said, let me see it.

28:36.370 --> 28:38.112
And let me take a look and see what I think.

28:38.272 --> 28:38.753
So I mean,

28:39.053 --> 28:41.056
and we went off in a box fast big.

28:42.297 --> 28:53.172
And he looked at it and called me back, called me up and said, why don't you just try to take one of these cars and do it as a model?

28:53.192 --> 28:58.799
And I went in, and that was a good idea, kind of, because I was really something.

28:58.839 --> 29:01.603
It was taking me out.

29:01.723 --> 29:08.031
In fact, I had to get a job, you know, teaching jobs in the meantime when I got into it, but...

29:09.175 --> 29:17.803
And I went in the very next day and set page one and started a novel.

29:18.004 --> 29:20.206
And it became a true detective.

29:20.226 --> 29:26.132
I relocated it, in fact, fictional-wise.

29:26.752 --> 29:28.514
But it's very much a first crime.

29:28.874 --> 29:34.460
It's very similar to the single crime that takes place in a true detective.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.841
So this is probably an

29:37.272 --> 29:40.257
the least autobiographical novel then.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.140
Yeah, there's nothing autobiographical novel.

29:42.160 --> 29:49.552
This is really, if you're looking for clues, Ted, you're not going to necessarily find them in this book.

29:49.572 --> 29:50.674
No.

29:50.694 --> 29:52.978
No, it's totally embarrassing.

29:53.058 --> 29:56.764
So I've probably really read the books that are going to take this, yeah.

29:56.784 --> 29:57.886
I know.

29:57.906 --> 30:01.071
I love the biographical stuff that you do.

30:01.251 --> 30:01.973
How are we doing?

30:01.993 --> 30:02.834
Is it still turning around?

30:03.175 --> 30:04.056
Yeah.

30:06.027 --> 30:09.332
It's an hour each back when you have to check out every length in a while.

30:10.613 --> 30:18.484
And so that notification step, I guess it worked out in a way, didn't it?

30:18.504 --> 30:22.089
Do you still feel like that?

30:22.109 --> 30:25.073
I don't know that I would, I wouldn't take down a project like that yet.

30:25.754 --> 30:32.423
I mean, a lot of writers seem to get attracted to actual events, crime incidents, because they're

30:33.230 --> 30:39.258
Because they seem to speak to such meaning and power, I kind of want to try to capture.

30:39.278 --> 30:41.000
I spent eight years in my book.

30:41.020 --> 30:44.845
I mean, Bloomberg is one of 14 chapters.

30:44.865 --> 30:48.369
I have one chapter that took me four years.

30:48.389 --> 30:55.558
There's this mystery guy who is an undue influence.

30:55.578 --> 30:56.119
I'm a multi-millionaire.

30:56.139 --> 30:59.844
He had $17 million to build a spreader in the library.

31:01.466 --> 31:03.068
And then there was a lot of news.

31:03.706 --> 31:14.160
to break the partnership, and it was impounded when I was trying to go see it, so I had to actually do investigative reporting, reading of information, you know, that kind of stuff.

31:14.180 --> 31:18.866
But you do, you get the test, but it's all making it great in this case, don't you?

31:18.886 --> 31:19.807
Yeah.

31:19.827 --> 31:25.795
You get that, and you've invested that amount of time, in fact, you must have been in bad shape for me.

31:25.815 --> 31:32.103
And let me tell you, the advance was a lot of money, and this was my first book.

31:32.123 --> 31:32.363
Yeah.

31:32.478 --> 31:35.842
And, you know, I play everything.

31:35.862 --> 31:38.967
I mean, I quit my job because I couldn't serve the two masters.

31:38.987 --> 31:39.227
Yeah.

31:39.948 --> 31:42.391
Well, you don't understand.

31:42.491 --> 31:43.893
I know I try very well.

31:44.254 --> 31:45.635
Yeah.

31:45.675 --> 31:48.679
You've got something that, you've got a 1,300-page manuscript?

31:48.699 --> 31:49.681
Well, mine was 950, you know?

31:49.861 --> 31:52.825
I don't know what you're talking about, don't you?

31:52.845 --> 31:56.269
Anyway, I don't know what it means.

31:56.289 --> 31:56.570
Wow.

31:57.791 --> 32:02.097
So, and that was your one attempt outside of fiction then, right?

32:02.718 --> 32:04.080
Yes.

32:05.222 --> 32:12.652
Everybody should develop as a writer from that experience.

32:12.672 --> 32:13.814
Good question.

32:13.994 --> 32:16.157
I think, in fact, it helped me as a writer.

32:16.318 --> 32:25.330
I think I learned a lot about looking outside of my house and trying to capture other characters.

32:25.611 --> 32:30.598
This true detective book is a multi-point-of-view book, and I

32:31.135 --> 32:51.094
I worked with a number of detectives and investigators, and I created very composite, a number of parents, and I have composites, and the kids, and the brothers, many brothers, there were no sisters, that didn't happen with the kids who had been picked up.

32:51.114 --> 32:56.719
I think it made me a better writer, but I had a real part of it.

32:57.980 --> 32:59.742
You got something out of it, though.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.373
I'm happy with the book.

33:02.393 --> 33:03.554
And the book did well, I gather.

33:03.574 --> 33:04.816
The book did reasonably well.

33:05.696 --> 33:09.981
I thought it would do better than it did.

33:10.001 --> 33:12.823
I was a great admirer of In Cold Blood.

33:12.843 --> 33:17.688
And this is going to be my own In Cold Blood.

33:18.649 --> 33:21.132
And I think it's fantastic.

33:21.152 --> 33:24.115
It's a book that I can pick up and begin to read.

33:24.615 --> 33:29.560
And it will take me into it, in a way, as a reader.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.866
that's reassuring me as a writer.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.829
Was that your last book with Sophie?

33:36.849 --> 33:44.956
No, I did two more, Winning the City and then A Collection of Stories.

33:45.337 --> 33:49.280
But Winning the City came out in 1990, I guess.

33:49.300 --> 33:57.808
A Collection of Stories followed in 1992, but by then, due to the recession, Jim was no longer

33:58.767 --> 34:11.225
My book was published by a... I hesitate to... In fact, it was published by a taxpayer.

34:11.506 --> 34:15.872
They situated someone to answer the phone.

34:16.012 --> 34:23.323
Simon and Schuster had, because the publishing company no longer existed, and that's when my book came out.

34:23.540 --> 34:27.767
I think I was the next to last publication.

34:27.867 --> 34:29.529
I'm not going to get into this at all.

34:29.690 --> 34:30.851
It wasn't reviewed.

34:30.871 --> 34:31.853
It wasn't distributed.

34:32.294 --> 34:35.979
I was at the Strand Bookstore a couple years ago.

34:36.500 --> 34:42.209
A year and a half ago I was wanting to do the Strand Bookstore.

34:42.229 --> 34:43.050
My daughter was there.

34:43.131 --> 34:46.616
She got the American Academy of Arts and Matters and Composers Award.

34:47.137 --> 34:52.365
We were in New York, had a big time all in the family getting together.

34:52.565 --> 34:55.169
I wandered down to the street.

34:55.189 --> 34:57.112
There was children's art.

34:58.474 --> 35:01.778
You know, 150 copies of it on their shelves.

35:02.299 --> 35:06.165
But I already had 20 or 30, so they're still there.

35:06.465 --> 35:07.086
They're still there.

35:08.468 --> 35:11.953
One of these days I'm in New York, I need to go in and buy some.

35:12.894 --> 35:15.378
Anyway, that book really wasn't published.

35:15.398 --> 35:19.324
It was printed, and it was put out, in fact.

35:19.344 --> 35:20.245
There were no reviews.

35:20.265 --> 35:20.726
Explain that.

35:21.026 --> 35:21.627
It's a difference to me.

35:22.028 --> 35:28.137
Well, some of the books have been gone through the printing sequence.

35:28.537 --> 35:34.085
They created a book, and it was bound.

35:34.286 --> 35:43.419
And that usually happens perhaps a month prior to publication date, say, five weeks, or something like that.

35:43.439 --> 35:51.310
And then in that five-week period, some of the books went into bankruptcy,

35:51.661 --> 35:53.223
No, they didn't go into bankruptcy.

35:53.283 --> 35:58.368
They just went to end up to the expectations of... Well, some had closed them down.

35:58.388 --> 36:05.715
I mean, some had closed them down within that period of time, and they all... There's nothing to do with bankruptcy.

36:05.795 --> 36:07.797
I mean, that's a highly bankrupt.

36:08.017 --> 36:08.898
Yeah, okay.

36:08.998 --> 36:12.441
Well, from Jim's point of view, they failed financially.

36:12.461 --> 36:12.641
Yeah.

36:12.661 --> 36:13.963
From Jim Sullivan's point of view.

36:14.603 --> 36:18.327
And he was gone, and Wendy Nicholson, who was the next...

36:18.577 --> 36:19.298
person in charge.

36:19.318 --> 36:20.118
They were all gone.

36:20.259 --> 36:30.148
I mean, the guy who bought my book at home, Alan Peacock, that was a famous story, and he got fired as a senior editor, and it was too good, because it was right up in this week's PW.

36:30.228 --> 36:31.409
Oh, was that right?

36:31.429 --> 36:41.479
Yeah, he was the one who bought one of the finalists for the National Book Award, which they finally, you know, and they made three books that were acquired by SNS editors.

36:41.499 --> 36:46.344
The editors got fired, you know, because these are high-quality editors.

36:46.524 --> 36:46.744
Yeah.

36:47.517 --> 36:49.679
But then nobody cares about them.

36:49.839 --> 36:54.223
I mean, that's what happened to me until, you know, Joe Fox became my enemy.

36:54.344 --> 36:55.304
He didn't care a lot.

36:55.324 --> 36:57.046
He didn't even want to read the book.

36:57.066 --> 36:59.248
He didn't even want to read it.

36:59.268 --> 37:01.070
I said, I got to enjoy it and see two chapters.

37:01.931 --> 37:03.652
The only reason you feel you need the reassurance.

37:03.853 --> 37:04.393
I did.

37:04.413 --> 37:06.015
You don't want to say that.

37:06.035 --> 37:06.655
You're following me.

37:06.675 --> 37:08.137
I'd like to know if you like it, you know.

37:08.597 --> 37:10.899
Anyway, I don't want to get into that stuff.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.161
My wounds are kind of healed.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.765
But, you know, how do you feel about that, I mean, for the record?

37:17.015 --> 37:19.518
that particular experience for the record?

37:20.139 --> 37:20.779
For the record?

37:21.120 --> 37:29.790
Oh, I felt just abandoned and let, you know, cut adrift without any help.

37:29.810 --> 37:34.455
Had you been assigned an editor and named, at least?

37:36.478 --> 37:37.899
I don't think so.

37:37.919 --> 37:38.700
I don't think so.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.441
So the thing was him?

37:39.461 --> 37:41.183
The thing was just...

37:42.462 --> 37:49.872
I spoke to the young woman on the phone a number of times who was at the desk, and she said, I'm just covering the desk.

37:49.892 --> 37:58.064
Well, this procedure is taking place, and I was calling saying a book's gone out for review, and she said, I'm sure they have.

37:59.205 --> 38:02.009
I never recall getting one.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.091
No one ever got one.

38:03.131 --> 38:04.272
I don't know the thing.

38:04.292 --> 38:05.093
I think I got one.

38:05.113 --> 38:08.498
I didn't even ever check, for example.

38:08.658 --> 38:10.020
I should probably show a check.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.322
We should see every evening.

38:12.010 --> 38:17.095
I'll review this because they cover most books published, I don't think.

38:17.115 --> 38:21.799
So, you know, this puts you in kind of an awkward position for the next book now, isn't it?

38:21.819 --> 38:21.919
Yeah.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.443
So, I was out on my own then.

38:25.883 --> 38:27.264
And what year was it?

38:27.405 --> 38:28.726
It was 92.

38:28.746 --> 38:30.187
That's pretty recent.

38:30.207 --> 38:31.208
Yeah.

38:31.228 --> 38:38.495
And I started working on this new novel, November 5th, which was underway.

38:38.935 --> 38:40.617
And I was working on it every time.

38:41.677 --> 39:02.608
And then when I finished it, and in the meantime, back there in the mid-80s, Gary Fitzgerald, as an editor at Random House, had conceived a vintage format.

39:02.628 --> 39:04.671
Marty Asher was there now.

39:04.871 --> 39:07.355
Yeah, Marty Asher was the current editor.

39:07.395 --> 39:08.236
Gary, I think.

39:08.517 --> 39:09.338
Marty, it looks like.

39:09.554 --> 39:12.717
He was one of one of my book on the first time.

39:12.737 --> 39:13.558
Oh, is that right?

39:13.578 --> 39:13.678
Yeah.

39:13.698 --> 39:15.219
And in fact, we had a hard-sought deal.

39:15.800 --> 39:22.326
But then when Becky Salatand left and went to Simon's sister, he was out of the loop.

39:22.666 --> 39:25.288
He didn't even know my book was his house.

39:25.308 --> 39:31.534
And I'm sure it never would have happened, but, you know, I always... I'm sorry.

39:31.554 --> 39:33.336
Okay, so Garner was over at Vintage.

39:33.356 --> 39:35.037
I didn't realize he was a Vintage.

39:35.638 --> 39:36.979
I've known him since the early...

39:37.448 --> 39:41.675
Gary, since the early 80s, I've met him when he was a young editor.

39:41.695 --> 39:45.421
He came to a writer's concert, and I met him when he was young.

39:47.404 --> 39:50.649
He may have still been in his 20s as an editor.

39:51.130 --> 39:55.718
Yeah, I think he's much more now than... He's still like 30.

39:55.738 --> 39:56.018
Okay.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.741
I don't know.

39:58.322 --> 39:58.703
I guess.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.145
I guess he's 37, 38.

40:00.225 --> 40:02.349
Alan Allen is both my own.

40:02.369 --> 40:03.270
Alan Allen is my own.

40:04.195 --> 40:05.537
It's great to have a young editor.

40:05.557 --> 40:05.997
Yeah, he did.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.601
He's probably all about us, you know.

40:08.681 --> 40:09.281
Yeah.

40:09.321 --> 40:14.808
Everybody raised it by him, you know.

40:14.828 --> 40:15.509
I'm sorry, Ray.

40:15.529 --> 40:22.418
Well, anyway, Gary had published... They were going to do a copy from the first wave of vintage books.

40:22.438 --> 40:30.488
His ideas had reached back into the memory of the past and published books, you know, selected kind of books.

40:31.810 --> 40:33.612
And early on, they...

40:33.811 --> 40:36.574
He got in touch, and he wanted to be McCarthy.

40:37.315 --> 40:41.760
But we decided to wait and publish it, coincidentally, with True to Texas.

40:41.881 --> 40:44.223
So it came out in 1987.

40:44.243 --> 40:45.825
The vintage version did.

40:46.426 --> 40:49.329
And I worked with Gary at that time.

40:50.130 --> 41:02.485
So now jumping ahead to 1992 or 3, when I was without a publisher, and Gary had served all over the place in the meantime as well.

41:02.819 --> 41:12.670
and then returned to Knopf as a manuscript.

41:12.971 --> 41:22.662
And I had my agent send me a copy of the manuscript, the Finnish manuscript, and then we got into contact.

41:22.742 --> 41:23.183
Great.

41:23.203 --> 41:25.746
Who was your agent?

41:26.707 --> 41:27.708
To your master.

41:27.828 --> 41:28.689
M-A-T-S-O-N.

41:28.709 --> 41:31.172
And how long did you get your agent?

41:31.962 --> 41:35.006
Peter Madsen has been my agent.

41:35.046 --> 41:35.827
What's my agent?

41:36.608 --> 41:38.010
Beginning in 1971.

41:38.390 --> 41:43.938
Who was the agent?

41:44.418 --> 41:46.200
He was my first agent.

41:46.221 --> 41:51.267
Although, what happened... Peter was my first agent.

41:51.287 --> 41:55.493
He worked for his uncle, the Harold Madsen agency.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.654
He was a young agent.

41:56.894 --> 41:58.657
John Irving and I were.

41:58.677 --> 42:00.018
Two of his first writers.

42:00.139 --> 42:01.260
I don't know.

42:01.527 --> 42:04.550
probably should be off the record.

42:04.650 --> 42:18.363
In any case, Peter called up one day and said he was going to break away from Harold and started on the agency and said, take two writers with him and he was going to make a million dollars, myself and John Irving.

42:18.763 --> 42:28.733
And I had two, I owed these contracts to the Harold National Agency and I said, Peter, I can't break from Harold, I still owe these books to him.

42:29.557 --> 42:31.960
Well, in any case, I stayed with Harold.

42:33.142 --> 42:46.379
He went off and started his own agency, and John Irving went with me, and then a couple years later, John hit his third day with Earl McCrane.

42:47.000 --> 42:58.315
I was still with Harold, and after another year, a couple years after that, I'd split from Harold and went without an agent for a while, and then I returned, and

42:58.565 --> 43:09.775
It's a business thing.

43:10.396 --> 43:28.572
And I had something of a friendship because of the number of years that we worked together.

43:29.918 --> 43:36.304
But no, not a creative thing.

43:36.364 --> 43:39.848
Gary Testy-John has been a wonderful editor for me.

43:42.090 --> 43:46.654
He's only a really good editor.

43:46.694 --> 43:49.657
Gary does line editing.

43:51.138 --> 43:53.220
He makes a lot of suggestions.

43:54.902 --> 43:59.166
And I thought it helped a great deal, tightening the line.

43:59.787 --> 44:08.918
Well, obviously, this title is clear in the very last chapter of the book.

44:10.580 --> 44:13.043
Is this a title of work from the beginning?

44:13.423 --> 44:13.604
No.

44:15.145 --> 44:19.711
No, the working title was Dining Out with Erich Avant.

44:19.811 --> 44:21.553
I saved that.

44:21.573 --> 44:22.995
That was my title.

44:23.676 --> 44:29.102
I wanted to call it something about Germany, and I, in fact, had a foreword in which I

44:29.774 --> 44:32.638
talked about the whole business stuff.

44:32.658 --> 44:33.279
I like it better.

44:33.779 --> 44:34.120
Do you?

44:35.221 --> 44:36.463
Whatever that's worth.

44:36.483 --> 44:38.506
No one likes it.

44:39.247 --> 44:40.628
No one likes it.

44:40.789 --> 44:44.974
I don't think on Novemberfest carries the whole... I mean, I see it.

44:46.696 --> 44:51.763
But how does it unite the whole novel?

44:51.843 --> 44:54.847
How does it resonate with the novel?

44:54.867 --> 44:58.532
Well, one of the... Certainly one of the themes I have in mind in that

44:58.951 --> 45:04.438
As you can see, we're making a transition here in the interview.

45:04.458 --> 45:06.040
We're going into the work now, okay?

45:06.640 --> 45:26.545
One of the things I really wanted to get at in the book was the sense of being in the fifties now, being my age, and the kind of play that the past might have for

45:28.330 --> 45:39.185
kind of middle-aged, hair-thinning, hair-grain, white male.

45:39.205 --> 45:48.559
And the kind of hammering in the back has come down on the group of us.

45:48.579 --> 45:49.059
Of 51.

45:49.260 --> 45:50.421
You're 51, yeah.

45:51.222 --> 45:56.650
I mean, I know you're talking to me in this novel.

45:57.018 --> 46:12.754
Well, I wanted to, in a sense, I mean, the way the title works, that title works for me is that it says something to the effect of, here's what it is like to be in the November of your life.

46:13.134 --> 46:15.056
And you have the past.

46:15.196 --> 46:16.818
Okay, good.

46:17.478 --> 46:18.139
Very good.

46:18.299 --> 46:18.720
Okay.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.341
I want to carry that.

46:20.401 --> 46:21.723
Life goes on over your head.

46:22.524 --> 46:27.008
I really, well, I have a couple of great lines that aren't in that show.

46:27.950 --> 46:40.162
That version, in the very concluding chapter, or part of the book, I have a couple of my touches that I finally did on.

46:40.302 --> 46:47.389
It seemed to be, I was trying to get home a bit on what I was trying to have that title say.

46:47.509 --> 46:52.194
But I really wanted to capture what it was like, what it's like to be young.

46:53.035 --> 46:57.619
That was the key, the important thing to me.

46:59.253 --> 47:09.023
And let's play that against what it's like to be a certain age and see how the world has shifted so much away from what your expectations would be.

47:09.463 --> 47:12.806
And of course, a good metaphor for this is this tenure track stuff.

47:13.307 --> 47:26.500
And this denial of tenure, I mean, this is really, in a very concrete way, I mean, people are going through this, losing jobs, or jobs are being paid, but this is very definite.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.741
You don't make tenure.

47:28.278 --> 47:29.159
Yeah.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.141
It's like being in the service.

47:31.201 --> 47:33.704
You don't make Lieutenant Colonel or whatever.

47:33.724 --> 47:41.532
If you get passed over two or three times, you're gone or you want to be gone or not.

47:43.254 --> 47:48.880
But it has come to... Tell me a little bit about this, working in this process as a guy teaching.

47:48.940 --> 47:49.841
Terrific teacher.

47:49.861 --> 47:52.464
Everybody acknowledges he's wonderful.

47:52.504 --> 47:56.108
Hasn't published directly a number of things and stuff.

47:56.341 --> 48:02.248
Of course, now we want the women and the main minorities.

48:02.268 --> 48:06.633
I sense a degree of... Is it anger on your part?

48:06.733 --> 48:07.854
Is this kind of a development?

48:07.874 --> 48:24.694
Are people being... Is this a comment on... Oh, I'm assuming that anger is, I guess, a feeling of... A disillusioning feeling of... I think that a lot of men...

48:25.113 --> 48:50.596
my age would feel of the world, I don't know, betrayal, but it's just that it all shifted away and treats, categorizes and treats money as dishonorable, hard to speak, even though it's not deserved.

48:51.176 --> 48:53.398
And things have changed

48:53.733 --> 49:22.947
in a very profound way, and I teach and my students today write, and perhaps they wrote about a decade or two ago, I don't really remember what they did, but there is not a white male figure who appears in anyone's fiction, who is not, and is a molester and abuser, a brutalizer,

49:23.467 --> 49:26.972
It's not a bigot.

49:26.992 --> 49:28.514
It's not a warmonger.

49:29.194 --> 49:31.738
They're obviously pretty badly experienced.

49:31.818 --> 49:37.145
I don't know what I should say.

49:37.165 --> 49:37.706
Yeah.

49:38.006 --> 49:40.129
So that's the solution.

49:41.871 --> 49:51.824
And I wanted to capture that kind of broad disappointment in a novel.

49:51.884 --> 49:53.406
But I wanted to play it against

49:54.567 --> 50:05.701
the more meaningful, satisfying expectations that one would have had as a young person.

50:05.721 --> 50:10.367
That's part of the reason why I really wanted to capture what it's like to be a young soldier.

50:10.407 --> 50:12.570
And it's a love story.

50:12.770 --> 50:21.942
I certainly wanted to try very hard to try to capture what it is to experience love.

50:22.968 --> 50:27.134
And then you play that against always disappointment.

50:27.274 --> 50:37.749
And I won't, I never give things away, but I was really cheering in the penultimate chapter segment at the end.

50:37.769 --> 50:41.434
She's going to go meet her, you know.

50:41.634 --> 50:45.980
And it was all the same conversation they had, you know, 40 years earlier.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.447
And then as she makes the phone call, I go, oh, man, all right, good.

50:50.467 --> 50:51.388
You know, the guy's on it.

50:51.925 --> 51:03.121
and whatever happens, happens where she's living the elegant life, and she couldn't work, but then he's in the car.

51:03.722 --> 51:04.683
It was very late.

51:05.484 --> 51:06.846
I didn't think she could.

51:08.428 --> 51:09.490
She couldn't do it.

51:09.550 --> 51:12.875
She couldn't come through with a needle.

51:12.895 --> 51:15.599
Well, I think it is interesting.

51:15.639 --> 51:18.362
I forget where the Thomas Wolfe room is.

51:19.724 --> 51:20.886
The Thomas Wolfe

51:21.237 --> 51:22.078
Where is it?

51:22.098 --> 51:22.779
It's in Berlin.

51:22.939 --> 51:31.770
Yeah, well, I mean, there is a... You talk about being unable to go back to the... I mean, that's impossible, isn't it, to go back?

51:31.790 --> 51:32.130
Yeah.

51:33.472 --> 51:35.535
I mean for it to be a positive ending.

51:36.376 --> 51:40.541
Well, you know, it's bittersweet, but... Well, he's getting some work through being recognized.

51:40.881 --> 51:41.943
Yeah, and I like that.

51:42.623 --> 51:45.187
And an area that they tell him is impossible.

51:45.207 --> 51:47.810
They put their noses down in translation, right?

51:47.830 --> 51:47.970
Mm-hmm.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.963
And that's kind of a commentary, too, isn't it?

51:51.043 --> 51:55.227
I mean, every guy finds satisfaction in being the translator of these works.

51:55.408 --> 52:02.716
But these clowns give them no credit for it.

52:03.136 --> 52:04.037
Yeah.

52:05.839 --> 52:08.462
Well, I guess we can keep going.

52:08.482 --> 52:09.603
How's your coffee holding up?

52:09.623 --> 52:10.324
Would you like more?

52:10.704 --> 52:11.846
Are you going to have some?

52:12.106 --> 52:12.326
Sure.

52:12.506 --> 52:14.449
Why don't we take a little break here?

52:14.769 --> 52:14.869
Okay.
