WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:07.840
I've interviewed you before, Marcus, and you're very quotable.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.486
We're talking with Marcus McCorrison at the Oregon Antiquarian Society.

00:13.128 --> 00:13.809
Let's just start.

00:13.849 --> 00:21.702
Do you believe that, as David Redden described to me, this is a golden age of book collecting?

00:21.722 --> 00:25.768
Do you think there's so much talk with all these options that have gone on?

00:26.862 --> 00:32.090
and the opportunities that have arisen with such as the Martin Sale, the Garden Sale, the Doheny Sale.

00:32.110 --> 00:33.653
Let's just start with that.

00:33.673 --> 00:43.888
Well, now that I think about it, of course, the Countess Doheny did are buying through the Rosenbach several generations ago.

00:44.109 --> 00:55.266
So, by coming on the market such as it did and really brought up by individuals more so than institutions, I guess,

00:55.769 --> 00:57.391
I think that's kind of what he was saying, too.

00:57.731 --> 00:58.552
Well, could be.

00:59.514 --> 01:09.225
And, of course, Bradley Martin had been collecting for 50 or 60 years or something like that.

01:10.387 --> 01:14.972
So I look at those, especially Martin, as a golden collector.

01:15.693 --> 01:23.903
The Countess Doheny, though, she was, well,

01:24.423 --> 01:34.415
Yeah, people were...it was a nice thing to do, to get rid of her husband's ill-gotten gains.

01:37.719 --> 01:39.841
Well, he was, he was a crook.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.723
It's not the first time, though.

01:41.743 --> 01:46.549
I mean, people have made sly allegations about John Carter Brown, too, I think.

01:47.103 --> 01:50.708
Well, anyway, I don't think of her as a collector.

01:50.728 --> 01:53.412
No, Bradley Martin Shirley was a collector.

01:53.832 --> 01:55.534
What distinguishes the two?

01:55.554 --> 01:56.716
What taste is the one word?

01:56.876 --> 02:12.958
Well, but I think that ... Obviously, she was buying the books, but I'm not quite sure why she was buying the books, and they kind of ran all over the lot, you know, from Inconabula to California imprints without any

02:13.343 --> 02:21.994
I would say, without any real focus on or probably any real intellectual involvement with the books that she was collecting.

02:23.316 --> 02:32.928
And that is the difference between herself and Bradley Martin, for example, or any of the other, like Bob Taylor or any of the other great collectors.

02:32.948 --> 02:36.733
You've given me two wonderful phrases over there.

02:37.373 --> 02:41.038
You know, and Waller Barrett and so on.

02:43.668 --> 02:52.039
Now, it's true that both those sales did send out into the market quantities of stuff.

02:52.620 --> 02:57.887
I think there was... And the prices in California, Carmel were... Carmel?

02:58.868 --> 02:59.349
Is that right?

03:00.150 --> 03:01.051
California.

03:01.071 --> 03:02.013
Well, it wasn't Carmel.

03:02.553 --> 03:06.238
No, it was actually... Yeah.

03:06.258 --> 03:08.061
I went up there for one of those sales.

03:08.101 --> 03:08.381
Did you?

03:10.464 --> 03:10.664
Yeah.

03:10.684 --> 03:12.747
And when the Western stuff was being sold.

03:13.132 --> 03:19.118
And it was fun to be there and saw a lot of people, I assume.

03:19.138 --> 03:23.563
And we got a nice Stockton, California imprint out of it at a very high price.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.628
Do you buy ... Do you do a sale?

03:27.648 --> 03:28.569
No, let me finish this.

03:28.929 --> 03:29.750
Yeah.

03:29.770 --> 03:40.962
So, yeah, I think there was a lot of private buying at that sale, because, for one thing, the prices were so high.

03:43.253 --> 03:47.498
But the stuff was scattered, well, to go into other collections.

03:48.639 --> 03:56.428
The Bradley sale, Bradley Martin sale, you know, I think that some of my bookseller friends were actually buying for stock at that.

03:57.249 --> 04:05.518
The prices weren't really as high as they could be, considering the quality of the material and condition and all that.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.443
I bought three lots of Bradley sales.

04:10.744 --> 04:12.045
They were affordable.

04:13.747 --> 04:17.553
It was certainly a good deal of action from those folks out.

04:17.633 --> 04:17.953
What is it?

04:17.974 --> 04:22.561
Joseph, the provider, and a variety of those people.

04:22.681 --> 04:27.909
I don't know whether they were buying on commission or whether they were buying for stock.

04:27.929 --> 04:41.610
Generally speaking, I think that when they spend those sums of money, 50 or 60K, or more, when they're never spending more than $22,000, we can assume that they're buying for money.

04:42.923 --> 05:09.532
Yeah, and there were, for example, the children, English, you know, Bunny Rabbit, what's her name, you know, the illustrator of Peter Rabbit, there were some wonderful examples of her work, and there were two or three collectors there, so those were people trying to fill in the most rare pieces, most uncommon pieces, out of his collection.

05:10.012 --> 05:12.475
You and I have talked before when I did a piece

05:12.725 --> 05:20.953
about the individual item as opposed to the depth and the breadth of the collection.

05:21.374 --> 05:25.538
For instance, the AAS would love to own a Tamerlane.

05:25.558 --> 05:26.259
The AAS doesn't.

05:26.399 --> 05:31.484
The little copy that Dick Manning got, well, he'd pay like $200,000 for that.

05:31.904 --> 05:38.171
Bradley Martins went for $150,000 to Bill Self, one of the people who will be sitting on L.A.

05:38.191 --> 05:40.293
I don't even think you guys bid on that.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.495
You were there.

05:43.606 --> 05:45.549
Kind of explain the thinking for me on this.

05:45.809 --> 05:48.473
That's an item you don't have, you'd love to have.

05:48.574 --> 05:56.125
I'm sure if you searched hard enough you could get a consortium of people, perhaps, to contribute to such an acquisition.

05:56.145 --> 06:02.615
And I don't know if you can or you can't, but maybe you could just kind of go into the thinking that goes into it.

06:02.635 --> 06:09.445
Well, institutional collecting has to be different from the individual collector.

06:10.218 --> 06:29.638
When I decide whether or not I should go for a piece like that or not, it has to be weighed against all the other things that we don't have, and it has to be weighed against the quality of the particular collection or particular niche that it's going into.

06:29.678 --> 06:38.807
Thus, our pole collection is not one of the great collections, and although that's one of the

06:39.496 --> 06:55.278
famous rarity is not going to make that much difference to the overall strength of the American Antiquarian Society collections and our ability to bibliograph and deserve scholars.

06:56.280 --> 07:00.526
So it's not worth a hundred and—if somebody wanted to give it to us, that would be wonderful.

07:00.706 --> 07:01.227
We'd love it.

07:01.948 --> 07:06.955
But I'm not going out for something like that to raise a lot of money from—because I've got

07:07.576 --> 07:14.524
My donors are so few that I have to treat them, you know, the only stuff that I have to have.

07:14.544 --> 07:22.472
Well, a Tamerlane would not attract scholars, would not necessarily by itself attract scholars to the US.

07:22.492 --> 07:28.659
The first printing of the Declaration is something else that I would dearly love to have here, and it ought to be here.

07:28.859 --> 07:29.800
That went to big bucks.

07:30.681 --> 07:34.866
And here again, you know, we're not ever going to go to try to bite.

07:35.133 --> 07:37.997
And Shitey's, I think, will go to Princeton.

07:38.357 --> 07:38.678
Sure.

07:39.679 --> 07:40.960
There are a few floating around.

07:41.041 --> 07:45.827
It's possible that we could get one as a gift, but it would be wonderful.

07:45.907 --> 07:47.168
Well, I'll get a project.

07:47.629 --> 07:47.949
I'll find out.

07:47.969 --> 07:49.872
It would be wonderful to get it.

07:50.172 --> 07:55.219
And that even makes more sense than Tamling by a long shot, I think, in a library collection.

07:55.239 --> 08:00.425
From a bibliographic sense, what would a fresh plain of the decoration do for the collection?

08:00.505 --> 08:01.286
It's just out of curiosity.

08:01.587 --> 08:02.608
It doesn't do much.

08:04.495 --> 08:13.022
What it does, it's the great cornerstone of American politics and history, and as such, it would be a great addition.

08:13.043 --> 08:23.291
And it certainly would stand nicely, based on local instance, which is... Well, and the other printings of the declaration that we've got that are only a few days later and stuff.

08:23.312 --> 08:24.553
And then think of Audubon.

08:24.853 --> 08:27.896
You know, there's another great book that we... Tell me that story, will you?

08:28.056 --> 08:31.439
Again, I'm gonna use that story.

08:31.459 --> 08:33.000
Okay, yeah.

08:33.706 --> 08:49.280
Well, as I recall it, the Audubon came here to sell his elephant photo set to the Antiquern Society, and the librarian, Sam Foster Haven, was busy when he first appeared, and was told to come back at 3 in the afternoon.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.142
He came back at 3, and the place was locked up.

08:51.762 --> 08:58.448
But I happened to notice, for some strange reason, a little article that I don't think I've ever read in our catalog the other day.

08:58.468 --> 08:59.469
I was looking up something.

09:00.690 --> 09:02.852
It's something about Audubon in Worcester.

09:04.587 --> 09:08.952
So you should get that out and read about it, because it must tell the story.

09:08.972 --> 09:11.495
That's Audubon and Worcester.

09:11.515 --> 09:14.039
Yeah, look under John James Audubon.

09:14.219 --> 09:19.485
Actually, there are a slew of cards, but there amongst them was this little card.

09:20.066 --> 09:24.932
And I thought I should fish that out and read it and see what really happened.

09:25.252 --> 09:26.634
Did it profile?

09:26.694 --> 09:28.596
I mean, did it illumine what happened?

09:29.077 --> 09:29.978
I just happened to see.

09:30.078 --> 09:31.920
I didn't get the piece out.

09:31.940 --> 09:33.362
I just happened to spot the card.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.131
So he came back, and they were closed, and he left.

09:36.151 --> 09:37.573
Yeah, and we never did.

09:37.653 --> 09:41.279
Of course, we would have bought it for $1,000 in 1840, I don't know.

09:41.299 --> 09:44.765
Yeah, I think your quote to me then was, he was just another bookseller then.

09:45.366 --> 09:46.468
That's a great quote.

09:47.349 --> 09:48.632
Now, the garden sale.

09:49.152 --> 09:51.096
Of course, that was so loony.

09:51.476 --> 09:56.504
I mean, that garden collection that we're talking about, the golden age of collectors.

09:56.524 --> 09:58.368
That is so far off the wall.

09:58.388 --> 09:59.890
That's a chapter, you know, in my book.

10:00.663 --> 10:05.448
That's an ungentle madness or something.

10:05.469 --> 10:07.130
I've done major, major research on that.

10:07.451 --> 10:09.413
Yeah, I know.

10:09.433 --> 10:11.295
But I mean, that guy is crazy.

10:11.515 --> 10:14.158
I've got a letter to him requesting an interview.

10:14.179 --> 10:15.440
He hasn't yet responded.

10:15.660 --> 10:19.925
You're not quoting me when I say something like, Mr. O'Moore is crazy.

10:19.985 --> 10:22.468
He is.

10:23.343 --> 10:24.204
Don't worry about that.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.466
I think that Nicholas is wrong.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.931
If he says, you know, what's that's got to do about book collecting?

10:28.951 --> 10:30.052
It's got everything to do with it.

10:30.072 --> 10:30.873
Absolutely.

10:31.454 --> 10:47.836
I mean, buying books like fine jewelry, you know, I'm just displaying my own... I wish it's... My own... This is something that should be said, by the way.

10:48.056 --> 10:50.700
Prejudices or...

10:51.254 --> 10:53.457
Well, treating it like it's an investment, in other words.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.079
Well, yeah.

10:55.099 --> 11:06.895
I mean, the real merit in book collecting, I think, is to build an intellectual whole, you know, an intellectual structure.

11:08.777 --> 11:10.720
What was the other word you first said?

11:10.740 --> 11:11.380
W-H-O-L-E.

11:11.441 --> 11:17.869
That isn't as good as intellectual structure around

11:18.237 --> 11:20.700
around an author or around a subject or something.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.904
That, it seems to me, is what, that's the highest end of book collecting.

11:24.924 --> 11:30.571
If one just buys, you know, this is wrong with what's wrong with Dick Manning.

11:30.591 --> 11:32.032
He doesn't know what the hell he's buying.

11:33.053 --> 11:39.460
You know, he's buying an Elliot Indian Bible, or he's buying a Tamarain, or he's buying something else.

11:39.881 --> 11:42.944
So, he's got a lot of money to throw.

11:43.685 --> 11:46.268
I'll tell you why you told me he started book collecting, by the way.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.210
Because he ran out of something else.

11:48.308 --> 11:54.134
Well, I suppose, you know, those are all legitimate reasons.

11:54.154 --> 12:11.293
But the real merit, the real word, though, is even if the collection is sold and not retained as a collection, at least the individual has invested some intellect as well as just money.

12:12.114 --> 12:15.818
I also have to read Tom Tanzel about the appointments.

12:16.186 --> 12:29.403
He felt, he is on record as saying, he was kind of upset that while most of Bradley Martin's stuff, it was correct to put that out, Lucille, the ornithological stuff really should have been retained as a collection.

12:29.643 --> 12:30.825
How do you feel about that?

12:30.945 --> 12:33.708
The word stuff, I guess, was pretty extraordinary.

12:34.990 --> 12:38.574
Yeah, it was a great, great big collection.

12:38.594 --> 12:45.383
I guess there's much to say about that, except it's too bad that the... Of course, they broke up those original drawings that

12:46.325 --> 13:12.180
should have been kept together apparently you know that apparently he'd offered that give that collection to cornell or i think cornell never answered or said it was all due i'm going to find out about that but and then he then he was going to give it to the smithsonian but he certainly had what i heard yeah but first of all he was supposed to offer it to cornell wouldn't know about that no i've forgotten steve asked steve weissman

13:14.388 --> 13:18.795
He's the terrible gossip amongst them.

13:18.815 --> 13:20.417
I've had lunch with Bart.

13:20.437 --> 13:21.779
He's really very good.

13:21.799 --> 13:22.600
Oh, he's terrific.

13:22.881 --> 13:24.904
He's been around a long time.

13:24.924 --> 13:27.007
He started at Seven Gables years ago.

13:27.027 --> 13:28.689
He gave me some very good stuff.

13:29.510 --> 13:31.914
I've got a chapter on Texas, by the way.

13:31.934 --> 13:32.515
Luke Feldman.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.817
Oh, L.D.F.

13:33.917 --> 13:34.418
And L.D.F.

13:34.478 --> 13:35.119
Cavallity.

13:35.419 --> 13:36.341
Cavallity.

13:36.441 --> 13:42.690
You know how when I called him and we talked, he said, you're doing something on

13:42.907 --> 13:43.708
in Texas.

13:43.728 --> 13:46.392
He says, I want to tell you what the title of your chapter is.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.554
That chapter has to be.

13:47.574 --> 13:49.217
I said, no, I'll tell you what you're going to tell me.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.239
He said, what?

13:50.259 --> 13:51.220
I said, quality.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.162
He said, you're right.

13:52.182 --> 13:53.303
He said, you can come see me.

13:53.404 --> 13:54.165
He said, okay.

13:54.265 --> 13:58.912
He said, you're doing your homework.

14:00.455 --> 14:01.657
That's a wonderful story.

14:01.677 --> 14:03.039
I have to give you Warren Roberts.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.122
The only one I haven't talked to yet is Deckard Turner.

14:05.603 --> 14:06.324
I'll get him.

14:06.484 --> 14:07.325
He's out there.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.307
Well, I don't know.

14:08.287 --> 14:10.650
He's hiding.

14:10.830 --> 14:16.417
Nobody in Texas, this is going to go in my book, nobody in Texas knows how to get in touch with him.

14:16.437 --> 14:20.682
I mean, he did not leave a telephone number where he can be contacted.

14:21.503 --> 14:24.347
He left with such a huff that, anyway.

14:24.647 --> 14:25.428
Oh, is that right?

14:25.448 --> 14:27.371
Oh, yeah.

14:27.651 --> 14:30.855
But Tom Staley's a very, very interesting guy.

14:30.895 --> 14:32.797
That place is wonderful, by the way.

14:32.958 --> 14:35.441
Again, my book is very good-hearted and good-spirited.

14:35.461 --> 14:36.522
I come away from Texas

14:37.058 --> 14:38.820
And I say, I don't care how much money they spent.

14:39.721 --> 14:42.283
The money's no longer available, and look what they have.

14:42.944 --> 14:44.045
And that speaks for itself.

14:44.445 --> 14:47.308
And they love the stuff.

14:47.328 --> 14:50.151
They take very good care of it.

14:50.171 --> 14:51.632
Anyway, we are jumping right.

14:51.652 --> 14:55.035
You're giving me some very good quotes here, by the way.

14:56.597 --> 15:00.280
So anyway, as far as the golden age of book working, I don't know.

15:00.681 --> 15:04.124
But that was just one way to open and get some quotes, and you gave me some good stuff.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.125
How about...

15:06.117 --> 15:08.280
What's this woman from the New York Times?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.842
What makes a rare book look rare?

15:09.982 --> 15:11.584
Do you have an answer for that?

15:11.664 --> 15:12.325
What would you say?

15:14.028 --> 15:15.630
What makes a book desirable?

15:16.331 --> 15:17.292
All right, that's another word.

15:17.312 --> 15:20.036
I think you have rare, you have scarce, you have desirable.

15:20.136 --> 15:26.965
Well, scarcity doesn't necessarily make a book rare.

15:27.966 --> 15:30.710
This could be the only copy of this notebook in the world.

15:30.790 --> 15:33.694
Well, rare is the...

15:34.518 --> 15:37.922
is a synonym, I think, for desirable.

15:38.783 --> 15:39.183
Okay, good.

15:43.328 --> 15:47.432
And there are infinite reasons for making any book.

15:48.454 --> 15:48.894
Any book.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.137
No, that isn't true, of course.

15:52.098 --> 15:59.766
Many, many thousands, millions of books could be desirable for any, I mean, thousands and hundreds of reasons.

15:59.786 --> 16:03.951
So, I don't, I think that's a,

16:05.652 --> 16:13.501
Okay, but do you think desirable equates with valuable?

16:13.521 --> 16:14.282
Monetarily?

16:14.302 --> 16:16.144
Yeah.

16:16.285 --> 16:19.508
Carol Ann, would you take the message, please?

16:22.492 --> 16:26.577
Well, it doesn't equate with monetary value, necessarily.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.060
Okay.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.465
That's a worthwhile observation, because especially if the

16:33.850 --> 16:35.892
Dealer doesn't know what he's got.

16:35.912 --> 16:36.513
Tell me about it.

16:37.674 --> 16:39.837
And then I get down and watch it.

16:39.857 --> 16:42.059
I got some stuff in Washington last week.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.462
I got a book I want to show you sometimes.

16:45.423 --> 16:46.404
I want this on the tape.

16:46.484 --> 16:47.044
I typed it.

16:47.104 --> 16:48.987
What was that book?

16:50.408 --> 16:53.812
Okay, we're talking about scarcity, rarity.

16:54.733 --> 17:03.182
And you could say that, on the whole, you would just... You'll not touch that as a... Well, you know, I mean, I think that the...

17:04.225 --> 17:17.681
The traditional view of rarity falls about incanabula and Renaissance books and high literature and things like that.

17:17.941 --> 17:29.254
It takes on the aspect of cachet, but a collectible book or desirable book can be

17:30.787 --> 17:36.953
Supply and demand, the woman said in Washington last week, Michelle Kier, Larry McMurtry's partner.

17:36.973 --> 17:42.097
She said she was asked that question by Paul Volker at a dinner party, what makes a rare book rare.

17:42.117 --> 17:43.779
She said, I said, supply and demand, sir.

17:43.799 --> 17:46.801
I mean, you should understand that.

17:46.861 --> 17:50.084
If there are more people who want a certain item, that makes it valuable, I guess.

17:50.104 --> 17:52.727
That makes it rare, which is a good answer.

17:52.787 --> 17:54.108
Fans come and go, you know, though.

17:54.849 --> 17:59.713
And a rare book, a very scarce and desirable book.

18:00.284 --> 18:10.239
both can be up in the market and then fall away off and be available very cheaply and then another generation or two they'll go back up in fashion.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.545
Longfellow now, you can pick up for a song.

18:15.466 --> 18:19.092
I mean, nobody was interested in the Longfellow stuff at the market sale.

18:19.112 --> 18:28.445
Poe is hot, but Hemingway, I mean, who can believe the prices on Edgar Rice Bone and Mickey Mouse as opposed to some of the 19th century classics.

18:28.465 --> 18:29.667
Do you feel that

18:30.811 --> 18:31.953
The fashion.

18:32.493 --> 18:38.061
Do you think that literary merit equates with monetary value?

18:38.181 --> 18:46.453
What you have to pay for something can be related to its worth, its stature, its reputation.

18:46.473 --> 18:54.264
And the reason I raise this, I'm talking specifically about the Americana sale of Bradley Martin's stuff.

18:54.284 --> 18:57.749
He had a very fine high spot collection of American literature.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.092
And you had the same dealers there buying Hemingway.

19:00.511 --> 19:03.215
And of course, Hemingway is hot.

19:03.335 --> 19:05.097
Faulkner is hot.

19:05.117 --> 19:07.140
Forget John O'Hara, he isn't existing.

19:07.281 --> 19:09.604
Or Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, crazy.

19:09.624 --> 19:13.089
Lafcadio Heard, but the Japanese are interested in Lafcadio Heard.

19:13.850 --> 19:17.996
Just in general, can you make any observations on that?

19:18.036 --> 19:19.518
Lafcadio Heard.

19:19.538 --> 19:20.459
Did you see the prices?

19:20.679 --> 19:21.561
Yeah, I remember.

19:21.921 --> 19:24.004
But it was the Japanese.

19:24.220 --> 19:28.705
But that was a wild card in that whole sale of Love Cardio.

19:28.765 --> 19:30.227
Everything else kind of made sense.

19:30.327 --> 19:33.050
Hearn didn't make sense, I don't think.

19:34.932 --> 19:38.737
I guess that's probably something, you know, maybe that's something that's perhaps better to say.

19:38.837 --> 19:43.302
Well, I think you can take a look at Cooper, because I'm particularly well with Cooper.

19:43.923 --> 19:50.430
When we started buying Cooper seriously, well, we

19:50.630 --> 19:52.732
been collecting Cooper for years.

19:52.832 --> 20:04.604
I mean, Clarence Brigham had gotten most of his first editions, many of his first editions, many of his first American editions, a long, long ago.

20:07.387 --> 20:16.536
When I started up again on Cooper, we were buying Cooper hand over fist at very, very cheap prices.

20:17.630 --> 20:20.414
We didn't have a first edition of The Spy.

20:20.494 --> 20:28.144
I bought that for like $1,400, 25 or 25 years ago.

20:28.164 --> 20:29.025
Was it in Scratch?

20:30.106 --> 20:30.347
No.

20:30.467 --> 20:31.548
That's a lot of money, wasn't it?

20:33.110 --> 20:35.373
Not then, and there's going a lot more now.

20:35.573 --> 20:44.285
And all of his ordinary books are going, I mean, we used to be able to buy them for $35 and things like that.

20:44.305 --> 20:47.569
Now they're $750 or whatever.

20:48.595 --> 21:00.513
And, you know, whether that's supply and demand or it's fashion, there's still plenty of Cooper around, but the price is up.

21:00.533 --> 21:15.936
I think he finally came back into his own as a significant American author, and whether or not it was because of the Library of... The Cooper edition of Pierre Clark and at AIS that kind of brought him back into... And Library of America.

21:16.912 --> 21:18.774
That just came out a couple years ago.

21:18.794 --> 21:20.536
It started 25 years ago.

21:21.957 --> 21:29.485
So, I don't know.

21:31.007 --> 21:33.029
It's partly supply and demand.

21:33.089 --> 21:36.052
It's partly fashion.

21:37.193 --> 21:46.783
But you're right, a lot of authors are not necessarily beneath contempt, but beneath the profitable level.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.353
Children's books.

21:52.594 --> 21:53.335
Unbelievable.

21:53.475 --> 21:56.058
Why are suddenly children's books?

21:56.138 --> 22:06.168
They used to be despised.

22:06.188 --> 22:09.391
What do you think?

22:09.511 --> 22:14.436
We used to have, frankly, a clear market.

22:14.456 --> 22:16.298
How would you rank your collection of children's books?

22:16.565 --> 22:18.067
Oh, in the U.S.?

22:18.087 --> 22:19.129
Yeah.

22:19.149 --> 22:19.590
Number one.

22:19.910 --> 22:20.471
Absolutely.

22:20.531 --> 22:22.153
Number one at all.

22:22.173 --> 22:26.240
Let the record show that Mr. McCorsen put it down.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.882
What the single did you think of?

22:28.062 --> 22:31.588
Oh, well, listen, hey, do you want to run through the list?

22:31.608 --> 22:32.509
Where were the best?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.212
Yeah, sure.

22:34.232 --> 22:39.479
Well, American fiction generally, and to your cutoff date of 1876.

22:39.519 --> 22:39.660
Yeah.

22:39.680 --> 22:39.920
Yeah, sure.

22:39.940 --> 22:43.726
And I mean the whole range.

22:44.367 --> 22:44.547
Come on.

22:45.809 --> 22:49.693
Not necessarily the American West, perhaps, but we're very close there.

22:49.913 --> 22:52.115
We've got a wonderful collection.

22:52.695 --> 22:59.101
We're going to have a big spring around our American West collection for the hell of a time.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.524
I don't know that it matches up with any.

23:01.544 --> 23:02.484
Tell me some of the things.

23:02.504 --> 23:04.186
This is the time, you know.

23:04.206 --> 23:04.847
It's good to see.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.568
Oh, you want this for your book?

23:06.588 --> 23:07.069
It's good.

23:07.089 --> 23:07.289
Oh.

23:07.950 --> 23:10.432
Well, have you gotten a copy of the guide to our collections?

23:10.712 --> 23:12.193
Yeah, but I want to hear you say it.

23:12.334 --> 23:13.875
Oh, well.

23:14.581 --> 23:17.183
I know what you're pre-eminent.

23:17.203 --> 23:21.928
I mean, I'm not totally naive as to look at that.

23:22.008 --> 23:35.841
American imprints, generally, up to 1820, and then enormous collections afterwards with our specialties of American fiction.

23:36.761 --> 23:43.828
Not American verse, although we've got a huge collection of American verse, but I don't think it's as good as Brown's, for example, or Library of Congress.

23:44.905 --> 23:53.994
But we cataloged our slavery books for a special project, the special grant money.

23:54.514 --> 24:03.903
And I don't know, we cataloged some 2,500 of them on slavery and anti-slavery.

24:05.565 --> 24:11.731
And I said, well, did we ever go through our miscellaneous pamphlets, pull out the pamphlets that aren't cataloged on slavery?

24:12.251 --> 24:14.153
No, we didn't do that.

24:14.639 --> 24:15.780
About 4,000.

24:16.741 --> 24:17.062
Wow.

24:18.723 --> 24:19.685
Just on slavery.

24:19.885 --> 24:20.485
Geez.

24:21.326 --> 24:30.256
In the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century, and politics, religion.

24:30.917 --> 24:36.743
Well, would you say, would you suggest that maybe your slavery holdings are better even than anything you might find in the South?

24:38.385 --> 24:43.971
Well, yes, definitely that, but the strong collections would be at the Library of Congress.

24:44.997 --> 24:48.001
various other places.

24:48.101 --> 25:00.377
But the point is that we really rival L.C., I think, for American printed material up through 1876.

25:01.077 --> 25:09.368
That doesn't mean that we have the best collection of Poe or things like that, but we don't, but taken as a overall,

25:09.888 --> 25:17.037
See, that's the point that you made, and I really want to get that in here, is that it's the collection that makes a collection.

25:17.377 --> 25:19.560
I mean, it's not the individual item.

25:19.580 --> 25:27.149
Nobody's going to travel here from Oxford to study post-Hammerling, I think, but they will certainly come here for American literature.

25:27.169 --> 25:32.695
For American literature, that wonderful book that that fellow did a year or two ago on American Renaissance.

25:32.715 --> 25:34.157
That was a spectacular book.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.483
It was done entirely here.

25:36.643 --> 25:37.223
David Reynolds.

25:37.243 --> 25:38.245
You couldn't do that anymore?

25:38.265 --> 25:39.246
Beneath the American Renaissance.

25:39.266 --> 25:40.327
Yeah, you couldn't do that.

25:40.588 --> 25:45.754
Bill Freeling is here from Johns Hopkins working on his second volume on the Civil War and all.

25:45.774 --> 25:52.862
He said, you know, he just can't believe it, what we've got here, and how thorough it is.

25:55.105 --> 25:57.027
He said he's got everything here.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.549
Isn't that wonderful?

25:59.350 --> 26:03.435
What kind of a, now this also is a theme that will work through my book, because

26:03.972 --> 26:07.558
One of the themes is the debt of scholarship.

26:07.638 --> 26:12.445
I kind of applied this in my book collecting column yesterday, which I didn't see.

26:12.565 --> 26:13.928
We didn't get a pretty big column.

26:13.968 --> 26:15.450
I'll make sure you get one of these.

26:15.470 --> 26:18.475
I do mention the AAS and Isaiah Thomas.

26:20.438 --> 26:29.592
The debt that institutions such as this have, maybe debt is too short of the word, to private collectors starting with Isaiah Thomas.

26:30.449 --> 26:32.052
Can you comment at all on that?

26:32.092 --> 26:39.208
Would you say that a lot of what you have, do you owe to the beneficence of private collecting?

26:39.248 --> 26:40.129
No question about it.

26:40.150 --> 26:49.369
I really ought to not be able to just off the top of my head kind of recite

26:49.720 --> 26:54.005
a long list of donors who've given us our... You might want to think about that even a little.

26:54.025 --> 26:56.108
We can talk again about it at some point.

26:56.128 --> 27:10.847
But, you know, Tom Streeter, for example, gave us a large collection of material on canals and railroads, which, for the early period, we got the best collection of railroad and canality ports.

27:10.867 --> 27:13.751
I got Bradley Martin's set of the Streeter catalog.

27:13.771 --> 27:15.052
I bought that at the sale.

27:15.072 --> 27:16.975
I got his set of a B.A.L.

27:17.295 --> 27:18.176
signed by Brad.

27:18.196 --> 27:19.558
I think it was 50 bucks for him.

27:20.197 --> 27:21.118
It's just very fair.

27:21.839 --> 27:24.102
And I did get one just for myself.

27:25.444 --> 27:29.589
It's a biblioteca of Pharma... Pharma Coppia?

27:29.949 --> 27:30.790
Yeah.

27:30.930 --> 27:32.873
It's a beautiful book.

27:32.893 --> 27:35.716
And I'd take a look at that.

27:35.736 --> 27:37.218
I'm very happy to have that.

27:39.601 --> 27:43.626
And... Well, I'd say Tom Street.

27:43.646 --> 27:45.869
And then we got a collection of Alexander Hamilton.

27:45.889 --> 27:49.714
I'm trying to think of who the donor was for that book plate.

27:50.234 --> 27:52.317
for all of that material years ago.

27:52.357 --> 28:11.520
And William O. Taylor, I think they call him General Taylor, of the Globe, sent us for years, box after box, kind of monthly, early American imprints, and particularly books illustrated with American, with American books illustrated with lithographs.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.825
We've got this fabulous collection of books with plates.

28:15.845 --> 28:17.067
Is this stuff that he collected?

28:17.187 --> 28:17.787
Yeah.

28:17.808 --> 28:19.870
That he acquired with you as my name was?

28:21.250 --> 28:32.124
And, of course, Michael Papantonio with his bindings, and we have a huge collection of early American hymnals that came from Bishop Peach.

28:32.144 --> 28:35.568
I think we bought those years ago.

28:35.588 --> 28:46.482
And, well, this Leeds collection, which we bought, but still, he made it really available to us, especially.

28:46.502 --> 28:50.387
He collected it with us in mind, I think.

28:50.527 --> 28:51.088
You think so?

28:51.305 --> 28:53.447
Is there something that could bear that out, do you think?

28:53.467 --> 28:54.348
That would be great.

28:55.290 --> 28:57.212
Do you think there'd be something in the correspondence?

28:57.552 --> 28:57.873
No.

28:58.173 --> 28:59.114
Yeah, you could talk to him.

28:59.234 --> 29:02.318
He's up in Prado Park in Vermont.

29:03.419 --> 29:04.320
I like you with us in mind.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.621
That's wonderful.

29:05.641 --> 29:07.664
That's a wonderful little insight.

29:07.704 --> 29:20.198
And then, of course, there's all the dealers that have a great affection, or if that's the right word,

29:21.055 --> 29:34.128
whatever, great regard, let's say, for the Antigone Society, and they do their best to steer their best stuff to us when they think it's going to be, we're not going to have it, and it's within our scope.

29:34.328 --> 29:50.404
And our scope, you know, is not really the most expensive books, but the most interesting intellectually, and I should tell you something about how people were, what people were thinking, how they were thinking.

29:52.038 --> 29:56.945
So that's what the Anachron Society is all about.

29:56.965 --> 29:58.046
It's a research collection.

29:58.066 --> 29:58.847
It isn't a collection.

29:58.927 --> 30:09.742
There are rare books here, but the point is there are rare books here, but there's thousands of them.

30:09.762 --> 30:11.144
They're not here because they're rare.

30:12.246 --> 30:18.214
They're out here only because they're rare.

30:19.173 --> 30:22.878
The bass album did come from Isaiah Thomas, I think, right?

30:23.999 --> 30:25.381
Didn't Isaiah get that?

30:26.162 --> 30:30.128
We've gotten, oh, nothing around.

30:32.691 --> 30:38.539
It was William Bentleys of Salem.

30:38.559 --> 30:46.750
And Isaiah Thomas, I've forgotten what

30:48.333 --> 30:49.154
first date.

30:52.197 --> 30:53.898
I think, oh, I know about it.

30:53.918 --> 30:58.402
Thomas, I think, describes it in his history of printing as being Gently's.

30:59.143 --> 31:04.908
And then by 1812, Thomas has bought it.

31:04.929 --> 31:10.073
Because when he lists his books that he's giving to the American clearance audience, it's in that list of books.

31:10.233 --> 31:17.260
In this chapter where I'll be profiling Thomas, this chapter is going to focus on Thomas

31:17.763 --> 31:22.169
Jeremy Belbeth, who I really like a lot.

31:22.189 --> 31:24.072
I'm going to start with Logan, of course.

31:24.112 --> 31:24.993
I'll throw it out there.

31:25.113 --> 31:26.114
I don't forget Bentley.

31:26.855 --> 31:27.216
Bentley?

31:27.456 --> 31:29.379
William Bentley.

31:30.741 --> 31:40.294
One, there's a wonderful diary, okay, that the Essex Institute published, yes, and has been reprinted.

31:41.556 --> 31:44.800
And he had a huge collection.

31:47.682 --> 31:49.504
Where did it go?

31:50.305 --> 31:53.769
No, he died before the Essence Institute was established.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.551
Some of them went out to Allegheny College.

31:56.312 --> 31:58.334
They had a big collection of German books.

31:58.354 --> 31:59.075
Okay.

31:59.095 --> 31:59.516
I forgot.

31:59.556 --> 32:00.217
Colonial?

32:00.237 --> 32:00.697
Maybe.

32:00.897 --> 32:02.279
He's colonial there?

32:02.399 --> 32:03.260
Well, they're not.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.102
They're European books.

32:05.122 --> 32:08.326
But I mean, he personally is what, a colonial collector?

32:08.346 --> 32:08.566
Yeah.

32:08.586 --> 32:10.368
He died in 1819 or something.

32:10.929 --> 32:11.830
Okay.

32:13.392 --> 32:16.896
So he parallels this same period as Thomas.

32:17.129 --> 32:45.870
and uh he's a correspondent of scientists in europe and does he talk in his diary about his collecting yeah because there's a diary of humphrey warmly which i'm using in my chapter two right who was the collector let me know by the way we can always resume this so you should look into him he's a very significant he had a huge question william bentley yeah i've not seen him mentioned anywhere which is really good well you should

32:46.053 --> 32:47.295
And Winthrop, too.

32:47.455 --> 32:49.077
Do you know John Winthrop?

32:49.097 --> 32:50.098
I know John Winthrop.

32:50.138 --> 32:51.840
Now, this is a major collector, right?

32:51.860 --> 32:52.121
Yeah.

32:52.681 --> 32:59.530
I mean, because there are so many collectors, but I'm really looking for collectors that have good stories to tell, like Isaiah, Logan.

32:59.550 --> 33:00.231
Well, look into him.

33:00.551 --> 33:02.033
I quoted Ed Wolfe.

33:02.534 --> 33:05.477
There is stuff on family, you know.

33:05.497 --> 33:06.218
Okay, I'll find it.

33:06.679 --> 33:14.929
And just tell me, the reason I mention this is I will recall, even though Ed Wolfe is certainly not a contemporary of Logan, he knows him.

33:15.449 --> 33:18.353
He wrote about it, and he worked with him.

33:18.373 --> 33:26.483
And while you are carrying a flame by Isaiah Thomas, can you tell me a little bit?

33:26.523 --> 33:28.265
Tell me a little bit what you think about him.

33:29.987 --> 33:36.796
Can you give me some insights into this character, Isaiah Thomas?

33:36.816 --> 33:37.857
What is collecting?

33:37.957 --> 33:40.100
Was he obsessed?

33:40.120 --> 33:41.001
What do you think?

33:42.601 --> 33:45.605
Was he a bibliolaniac with his grandson?

33:47.488 --> 33:48.089
Yes, he was.

33:51.153 --> 34:02.349
Did he really collect or write the book, or did the book really kind of just evolve as a consequence of all this collecting?

34:02.389 --> 34:06.194
This society basically was formed as a repository for his stuff.

34:06.274 --> 34:09.098
That is correct.

34:11.761 --> 34:13.183
Yes, he was a book collector.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.286
He was a collector, let's say.

34:15.306 --> 34:17.990
I mean, not necessarily just books, but stuff.

34:18.471 --> 34:22.697
What we call today ephemera, books, newspapers, the whole range.

34:24.921 --> 34:40.384
Well, first of all, he was a printer, and he was very intelligent, and he became, because of his intelligence and all, he became extremely

34:40.735 --> 34:43.559
interested in the history of his craft.

34:43.579 --> 34:46.844
Now, that's not unusual on printers, I think.

34:46.864 --> 35:01.966
I mean, old hand printers, and still scholarly printers today that take great pride in the craft of printing, and his traditions, and his history.

35:01.986 --> 35:07.654
You can find them around like Rocky Steinauer, or people down at Yale.

35:07.894 --> 35:10.658
There's been a lot of those, Ray Nash, and lots of

35:11.768 --> 35:16.074
lots of people around who've been obsessed with the history of their craft.

35:16.455 --> 35:18.077
I think Thomas really was one of those.

35:18.357 --> 35:30.295
And he was interested in books as examples of printing, of the history of printing, and he bought in Cannabula.

35:31.597 --> 35:39.548
He collected, he tried to collect, he knew something about the history of printing, you see, European printing, the beginnings of printing in Europe.

35:40.304 --> 35:59.210
So, he tried to collect examples of European printing that were famous, like Robert Hestien, or Stephen Roberts, the royal printers in Paris, and so on, and he had a couple of pieces of Incarnabula and stuff.

35:59.230 --> 36:04.898
He didn't have much, and it would be very difficult for him to collect them as he was commissioning it to buy them.

36:05.018 --> 36:07.341
Do you know what I'm writing here?

36:07.625 --> 36:13.030
He made a connection between Isaiah Thomas and Samuel Pepys, and that went through Pepys Library.

36:14.031 --> 36:19.957
He collected for precisely, among many other reasons, but he was fascinated by examples of dandy.

36:21.199 --> 36:34.392
Then I think he, then I think Thomas, he started collecting American newspapers, you know, while he was still active in printing, as a businessman.

36:35.333 --> 36:41.520
in the 1790s when he was buying up newspapers.

36:41.700 --> 36:51.951
And so he was doing that, probably looking toward the history of printing up to his time, colonial printing.

36:53.253 --> 37:01.442
And then, of course, you can see books that he's printed where you've got a little book upstairs where he

37:02.148 --> 37:10.657
The text is American, the engraving is American, the binding is American, and he has this little thing about that.

37:10.837 --> 37:16.323
And then he had his library bound up, you know, just spectacular.

37:16.403 --> 37:20.067
It must have been glorious, gorgeous.

37:24.052 --> 37:27.936
Most of them, unfortunately, are in pretty tough shape now.

37:28.962 --> 37:31.686
But, so he was a real bibliophile.

37:31.766 --> 37:35.651
He was a real collector, but he was also looking, and I consider him a real collector.

37:35.691 --> 37:37.394
He wasn't buying just this and that.

37:38.655 --> 37:43.682
He was buying books with an intellectual purpose, just like Logan did.

37:43.762 --> 37:48.549
I mean, you know, he was a real intellect and buying books.

37:49.971 --> 37:51.413
In fact, he wasn't buying books.

37:53.335 --> 37:55.999
He was buying books to form a library for his own

37:56.755 --> 37:59.639
intellectual interests rather than collecting books.

38:00.901 --> 38:02.083
That would be representative.

38:02.103 --> 38:03.205
Logan did the same thing.

38:03.285 --> 38:05.067
Well, I'm talking about Logan.

38:05.087 --> 38:05.448
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:05.468 --> 38:05.708
Yeah.

38:07.311 --> 38:08.993
I thought you were talking about Isaiah.

38:09.113 --> 38:15.203
No, Thomas didn't have that breadth of intellectual stuff.

38:15.343 --> 38:16.985
He wasn't a collector of the true sense.

38:17.165 --> 38:18.968
He saw functional stuff.

38:18.988 --> 38:25.598
Does this film make... Oh, shoot.

38:25.983 --> 38:27.525
McKenzie, down in Philadelphia.

38:27.545 --> 38:29.007
Did Ed mention him?

38:29.207 --> 38:29.427
No.

38:31.069 --> 38:34.473
Who did, who was collecting books that we now think of as rare.

38:34.513 --> 38:39.018
I mean, as examples of... I'm going out of Philly next week.

38:39.339 --> 38:45.766
William McKenzie, and his collect, his books, many of them are at the library company now.

38:45.786 --> 38:45.886
Okay.

38:45.906 --> 38:55.838
But he seemed to be a serious, big book collector, something like Bradley Martin, for example.

38:56.324 --> 39:22.500
some of the same impulses uh you were going to say one thing and you didn't finish it was about this is back a bit mr christian you were saying why nicholas is wrong why oh the garden oh well he's told nicholas said to you you know what does this have to do a book collecting yeah well my answer is that there has to be this

39:23.813 --> 39:33.384
intellectual vision of what you're collecting, that you form some kind of an intellectual hole or intellectual structure with your books.

39:35.527 --> 39:40.973
And this apparently... Well, of course, that's what Haven Omura thought he was doing, wasn't he?

39:40.993 --> 39:43.676
He thought he was... Well, it was all high spots.

39:43.696 --> 39:48.762
He was collecting the monuments of world thoughts, perhaps.

39:48.782 --> 39:49.222
315 lots.

39:49.242 --> 39:49.563
Yeah.

39:50.864 --> 39:52.386
He hadn't had enough time to do that.

39:53.041 --> 39:55.847
You have a lot of money.

39:55.967 --> 39:57.229
Tell me where you want to wrap up.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.556
What else have you got on your list?

40:00.757 --> 40:03.061
Okay, I think we've covered a lot of the things.

40:03.622 --> 40:08.873
Maybe, could you think of anybody who might recommend my seeing out in California?
