WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:10.491
William King Richardson Room, W.K.

00:10.511 --> 00:24.271
Richardson Room, which has the desk and the panel and the portrait and the books and the manuscript.

00:24.531 --> 00:29.699
A dedicated Harvard collector, a famous Boston lawyer, patent attorney.

00:29.719 --> 00:30.460
That's right.

00:30.811 --> 00:39.365
A student at Balliol, Oxford, before he settled down to his work in Austin.

00:39.385 --> 00:47.678
And a collector specialized in binding and really fine binding, early printing.

00:47.898 --> 00:56.312
Are bindings important to rare book collections?

01:00.224 --> 01:10.499
Yeah, this is wonderful.

01:10.819 --> 01:12.541
And there's these bindings.

01:12.561 --> 01:17.108
You see, there's a powdered gold binding, that green one in the middle.

01:18.109 --> 01:19.732
Madame de Pompadour on the left of it.

01:20.593 --> 01:23.837
And a coal bigger with a serpent.

01:23.857 --> 01:27.923
And there's a grolier on the upper left there.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.185
You see the narrow one.

01:29.992 --> 01:37.201
findings of the sort that an institutional library would not purchase, you know.

01:37.302 --> 01:49.157
So this collection gives us the advantage of being able to exhibit and demonstrate to students books like that that we never could show otherwise.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.819
Would you buy it?

01:50.879 --> 01:52.862
You could never justify buying them, right?

01:52.882 --> 01:55.746
These are very great manuscripts.

01:56.146 --> 01:59.931
These are cases that now are

02:00.485 --> 02:04.810
protect the manuscripts in that particular case.

02:05.310 --> 02:12.659
Time and time again, Richardson manuscripts and Richardson books figure in our exhibitions as they're the best of type.

02:14.721 --> 02:18.325
So it's a great collection, and one which is also very useful in teaching.

02:19.246 --> 02:25.833
Down in this corner, there are a lot of incandibles, and they're very useful to me, and the seminar was right around the corner.

02:26.334 --> 02:29.918
Sometime at the last minute, when I need some examples of things, I can come in here.

02:30.185 --> 02:31.887
A-L-D-I-N-E.

02:31.927 --> 02:37.495
This place is wonderful.

02:37.595 --> 02:44.946
And of course, this is Amy Lowell's room.

02:45.126 --> 02:48.150
She was a great collector.

02:49.492 --> 02:53.998
She wrote a very press biography of Keats.

02:54.539 --> 02:58.825
A lot of association copies of books inscribed to her by her contemporaries.

02:59.159 --> 03:01.401
And she was very helpful to her contemporary office.

03:02.403 --> 03:07.448
And then she collected classic English fiction from Anthony Burney.

03:08.850 --> 03:17.820
This is the ring with electrostechnics.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.244
Roger, did you know anything about the media comments?

03:21.684 --> 03:25.648
No, nothing.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.812
But she goes up to Harding or Harding.

03:29.281 --> 03:35.809
It's even framed up to quite modern times.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.171
This doesn't happen often.

03:37.231 --> 03:42.237
A collector gets a room at Harvard.

03:51.328 --> 03:55.814
Chancellor says you might see it in Texas.

03:55.934 --> 03:56.875
This is the great room.

03:57.158 --> 03:59.841
And this is, of course, Arthur Hoden's very love.

04:01.103 --> 04:05.849
He loved Keats rather than any other English author.

04:05.869 --> 04:09.794
And this room was part of the original plan for the Hoden Library.

04:10.274 --> 04:18.044
The Richardson Room came in 1949 or 50, something like that, almost 10 years after the library had been built.

04:19.065 --> 04:22.450
And that is a life mask of Keats as opposed to a death mask.

04:22.850 --> 04:24.432
There is no death mask in the collection.

04:28.698 --> 04:30.741
Emily Dickinson is in here, I believe.

04:32.043 --> 04:37.292
Yes, Emily Dickinson, the Emily Dickinson manuscripts and books from the Dickinson house are in that room.

04:38.494 --> 04:47.108
But we can't say that she's a Harvard collector, but we can say that Arthur Harvard and William King Richard Smith... You don't have all the faxicles, do you?

04:47.208 --> 04:47.589
Or do you?

04:48.390 --> 04:49.232
The Dickinson?

04:49.873 --> 04:52.157
No, no, no.

04:52.177 --> 04:53.659
That's been a matter of some...

04:54.922 --> 04:57.025
contention, I guess, which I know about.

04:57.045 --> 04:58.788
We don't have to ask you about.

05:01.772 --> 05:06.960
It would be part of an exhibit, as you mentioned, of collections, contributions.

05:07.241 --> 05:23.005
We're still thinking about this, but we'll probably make an exhibition of books and manuscripts that are important in their own right, and that

05:23.997 --> 05:32.486
It really fits in with what I'm writing about.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.390
Would you like to read some of my copy, by the way, when I have some?

05:36.410 --> 05:39.253
Well, I'll be happy to read some a little bit.

05:40.234 --> 05:43.197
The historical stuff, if you'd like.

05:43.257 --> 05:48.823
I know you're a busy man.

05:55.604 --> 05:58.849
We are nowhere.

05:59.029 --> 06:04.357
There are two levels of bookstacks like this.

06:04.377 --> 06:06.880
What you're looking at is the beginning of American books.

06:09.524 --> 06:15.793
You can tell that.

06:15.813 --> 06:17.035
Indian Bibles.

06:17.055 --> 06:18.157
Is that a cotton movie?

06:19.118 --> 06:22.523
That's Elliot's Indian Bible.

06:22.874 --> 06:32.008
These are all tract volumes or sermons from the Mather Library, owned by some of these.

06:32.829 --> 06:42.204
To be fair, they have the Mather Library, and we have a few books, a couple of shelves from the Mather Library.

06:42.224 --> 06:46.190
What's good is that they're all close.

06:46.470 --> 06:50.316
I mean, that the scholar doesn't have to go far.

06:52.456 --> 06:56.262
Here's the account of the fire that wiped out the Harvard Library in 1764.

06:56.282 --> 07:12.084
And there was immediately a great international effort to repair the damage of that fire to both the scientific instruments, which are the apparatus, and the library.

07:13.567 --> 07:22.159
And that's how Thomas Hollis becomes so important to Harvard for the many cases of books that

07:22.645 --> 07:25.670
came from him and John Barnard.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.352
Thomas Hollis.

07:27.453 --> 07:28.795
Hollis, H-O-L-L-I-S.

07:28.855 --> 07:33.442
Now that's Barn's project.

07:33.842 --> 07:34.844
W.H.

07:34.904 --> 07:47.584
Barn, a Norris librarian, is publishing at Cambridge Press, his lecture series on Hollis.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.547
He'll be coming out in January, probably.

07:50.168 --> 08:11.383
probably be available to you called bond where's where's bond from uh he's from the library okay he's around here then i can talk to him yes you can he lives in concord and he comes into the library um fairly regularly

08:12.562 --> 08:14.685
You'll find him in the phone book, credit and copy.

08:14.785 --> 08:18.350
And you might well find that he would make a date of use on Thursday.

08:18.471 --> 08:20.534
It might be interesting to chat.

08:22.997 --> 08:28.826
What kind of... Is this the halon stuff?

08:28.846 --> 08:29.547
Do you have that here?

08:29.967 --> 08:31.169
No, that's a detector system.

08:31.189 --> 08:31.990
Oh, that's a detector.

08:32.010 --> 08:32.992
What do you use for that?

08:33.072 --> 08:38.660
That's a detector system.

08:39.221 --> 08:42.045
I suppose the things I...

08:42.329 --> 08:47.015
I am reluctant to talk about are security systems and fire systems in libraries.

08:47.836 --> 08:53.944
And if you could bring yourself to leave them out of your book, you would do us all a favor.

08:53.964 --> 08:54.305
Okay.

08:54.525 --> 09:01.034
Instead of saying, whereas Yale and Folger have this system, Harvard... No, no, I wouldn't do that.

09:01.955 --> 09:02.996
You know why I wouldn't do it?

09:03.016 --> 09:03.637
You know what I mean.

09:03.838 --> 09:04.879
Yeah, well, it's boring, too.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.842
I don't wish to write a boring book, either.

09:06.942 --> 09:11.728
And it's easier, alas, to obtain information about that than it could be.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.223
It's just awful.

09:14.243 --> 09:25.740
When you get to someone like Melville, and here's the end of Melville, you wind up with books from his library, as you do with Henry James, that I was just talking about.

09:26.501 --> 09:33.111
Here's the leer that he read just before revising Moby Dick.

09:33.672 --> 09:34.593
That's in his hands.

09:34.633 --> 09:38.779
Ego non baptizo te in nomine.

09:39.164 --> 09:45.130
Patris at filii et spiritus sancti, said in nomine Diaboli.

09:45.751 --> 09:53.680
Remember that verse on the... The Dramatic Works of Shakespeare, item 7, 1837.

09:53.740 --> 09:56.763
That's Melville's copy, annotated in his hand.

09:57.083 --> 10:00.687
In a Boston edition of the Works of Shakespeare.

10:00.707 --> 10:03.270
I have this set in my collection.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.753
It's a nice one.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.014
Yeah.

10:07.034 --> 10:07.855
It has the...

10:08.122 --> 10:12.349
It has Billy Budd in the poems, and the poems are first.

10:13.671 --> 10:17.697
I dare say my set is in nicer shape.

10:17.717 --> 10:18.578
Well, that one's been used.

10:19.039 --> 10:28.274
Now, remember that the manuscript of Billy Budd, the manuscript goes like poems here in this library, even portrait that you've seen.

10:29.075 --> 10:34.163
Those manuscripts can well be the reason that Melville was rediscovered.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.563
So it is said... Well, it certainly helped.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.905
It certainly did Billy Budd.

10:38.925 --> 10:39.926
Billy Budd.

10:40.066 --> 10:45.173
Well, this goes on.

10:45.253 --> 10:48.437
We've passed volumes from E. E. Cummings's library.

10:49.838 --> 11:00.792
And that's something special in this library, that we have so many books from the libraries of interesting people.

11:01.801 --> 11:09.894
some of whom are authors, and some of whom have their papers here, and some Cummings.

11:09.914 --> 11:20.170
Cummings' papers, his manuscripts and correspondence are here, and a lot of the books inscribed to him by contemporaries are annotated by him.

11:20.190 --> 11:26.340
Bronson Alcott's papers are here, and so are the books from his library.

11:27.485 --> 11:34.517
The books from Lowell's library, Henry James's, William James's, Melville's, even Carlisle.

11:36.119 --> 11:54.049
The library that Carlisle formed to work with, kind of study of Frederick the Great, was brought to Harvard, thanks to the efforts of Charles Allen, Northern, and L. East.

12:01.707 --> 12:05.471
These look like manuscript drawings or whatever.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.473
We've got a new phone system.

12:07.493 --> 12:07.633
Uh-huh.

12:07.653 --> 12:12.898
And we're working on the air handler.

12:12.918 --> 12:21.886
And you'll find us closed just before school in order to come up to work into... One of these giant... Well, this is just a section devoted to folios.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.108
Uh-huh.

12:23.128 --> 12:28.993
And you'll find here the double elephant folios all gone.

12:29.013 --> 12:30.735
May I just feel it?

12:32.318 --> 12:32.638
May I?

12:33.039 --> 12:33.700
Yes, you can feel it.

12:34.782 --> 12:35.543
It's like that.

12:35.703 --> 12:37.606
Why don't you take it?

12:37.626 --> 12:39.108
Would you mind taking it?

12:39.349 --> 12:43.615
I would just like to open and look at one of these.

12:44.657 --> 12:45.178
Okay.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.000
Why don't you take that whole end.

12:48.102 --> 12:48.322
Wow.

12:48.963 --> 12:50.305
Put it down.

12:51.207 --> 12:53.450
This is a moment for me to save this.

12:53.650 --> 12:59.079
I've handled Bill Scheide's Gutenberg and the Tamerlane at... No.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.262
Why don't we?

13:04.482 --> 13:06.585
Why don't we just grab this brush?

13:06.965 --> 13:09.689
Okay.

13:09.709 --> 13:14.095
And we open to some... No, we're not.

13:16.278 --> 13:18.020
This is quite an exquisite copy, isn't it?

13:20.824 --> 13:21.926
This didn't fox at all.

13:21.986 --> 13:25.511
I mean, not this particular copy, but Audubon in general didn't fox.

13:26.812 --> 13:28.975
He must have used very, very fine paper.

13:28.995 --> 13:30.237
I have not seen many.

13:31.280 --> 13:35.004
I remember the coffee in the Beinecke.

13:35.024 --> 13:40.230
They have that special case that you show there, Audubon.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.413
That's a clean coffee like this.

13:42.433 --> 13:44.095
You can put this over here.

13:44.495 --> 13:45.336
Let's just grab this.

13:45.596 --> 13:47.218
I'm quite thrilled.

13:47.278 --> 13:49.361
The same clunk of leaves.

13:49.421 --> 13:50.802
Can you grab the whole?

13:52.785 --> 13:55.808
Yeah.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.052
You made my dick.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.173
Now, if you can take the

14:00.727 --> 14:06.534
That's volume one.

14:09.317 --> 14:12.541
Only at this point will I take out my pen and write in my notebook.

14:16.806 --> 14:18.669
Volume one, Audubon.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.752
Open to the song, Sparrow.

14:23.555 --> 14:28.000
Part of this quest has been a very tactile experience, too, you know?

14:31.287 --> 14:31.647
That's great.

14:31.668 --> 14:38.557
That's what books are supposed to be for collectors and spars and librarians.

14:38.577 --> 14:42.061
You lock them, you pick them up, you open them up.

14:43.924 --> 14:53.877
And if you're all too aware of the distinction between a little elephant folio, a book that comes in that format, and a little miniature book.

14:54.117 --> 15:00.906
And it's part of the significance of books, of their shape and size and weight.

15:01.763 --> 15:07.169
and we're easy to manipulate and work and use, we're difficult.

15:09.211 --> 15:22.344
And then, of course, it's part of our custodianship that we do careful of books so that we pass the mind to others in a great condition and that we don't use books up.

15:22.364 --> 15:24.827
That's our ethic in real books of guardianship.

15:25.427 --> 15:28.290
The ethic is, state it once again, that we don't use books up.

15:30.172 --> 15:31.213
And on the other side of it,

15:32.071 --> 15:38.517
and we're inundating our students with books, trying to get them to read and study, we're doing that with books that we do use up.

15:38.977 --> 15:41.680
You know, we're replacing them.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.642
We have a Riverside Shakespeare.

15:44.723 --> 15:46.404
Well, that's not there to preserve.

15:46.484 --> 15:51.889
That's there to be used until it can't be repaired any longer, and then it's replaced with another one.

15:53.391 --> 15:54.932
That's another side of books.

15:54.952 --> 15:55.773
It's not our side.

15:57.034 --> 15:59.997
If Riverside Shakespeare comes here, it is a record copy.

16:00.057 --> 16:01.538
It is the first printing of

16:02.176 --> 16:17.737
an important new set of notes, or it is a copy that belonged to someone and got annotated, and for one reason or another, must be preserved to the extent that they were able to preserve it.

16:17.757 --> 16:18.018
Okay?

16:18.038 --> 16:18.379
Yes, sir.
