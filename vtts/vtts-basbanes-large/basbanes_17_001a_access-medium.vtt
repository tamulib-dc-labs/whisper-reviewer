From WAMU and NPR in Washington, D.C., I'm Lynn Neary of NPR, sitting in for Diane Rehm.

01:00.368 --> 01:03.493
She's away for treatment of her voice disorder, and she will be back soon.

01:04.335 --> 01:06.779
A great library cannot be constructed.

01:06.879 --> 01:08.462
It is the growth of ages.

01:08.442 --> 01:13.409
That's one of the many ideas that author Nicholas Basbanes explores in his new book.

01:13.429 --> 01:19.458
It's called Patience and Fortitude, a Roving Chronicle of Book People, Book Places, and Book Culture.

01:19.478 --> 01:30.815
It's full of stories about people who have devoted their lives to the written word, about the public institutions that house our most valuable and extensive collections, and about the personal vision behind many private libraries.

01:31.296 --> 01:32.998
Nicholas Basbanes joins me in the studio.

01:33.058 --> 01:34.120
Good to have you here this morning.

01:34.140 --> 01:34.781
Thank you very much, Lynn.

01:34.801 --> 01:35.462
Pleasure to be here.

01:35.560 --> 01:41.129
Now, this book is part of a project that is going to be a trilogy, as I understand.

01:41.149 --> 01:42.611
Maybe you can tell us a little bit about that project.

01:42.651 --> 01:46.117
It's definitely going to be a trilogy, and I threatened to make it a tetralogy.

01:46.137 --> 01:46.537
Who knows?

01:47.219 --> 01:55.071
But the first book was titled A Gentle Madness, which appeared in 1995, and the premise there was to develop...

01:55.051 --> 02:03.901
This idea that so much of what we treasure and value of our history, our culture, our heritage, we owe to these nutty, eccentric book collectors.

02:03.921 --> 02:19.658
I laugh because every time I think of them, they're fabulous people who have been dedicated to preserve these artifacts, which it turns out to be such things as the Beowulf manuscripts, you know, for the British epic, or Francis Parkman going south.

02:19.638 --> 02:29.549
during the Civil War from Boston to collect all these Confederate imprints, now giving the Boston Athenaeum and Boston the finest collection of Confederate imprints you can find anywhere.

02:29.989 --> 02:36.876
Well, that's what General Madness attempted to demonstrate through history and also the great living collectors.

02:37.397 --> 02:41.121
Patience and Fortitude, and trust me, it's not a Jane Austen novel.

02:41.201 --> 02:43.063
People say to me, they look at the title,

02:43.043 --> 02:46.350
Well, we should tell people where that title comes from because it's a good story.

02:46.390 --> 02:58.256
Exactly, because Patience and Fortitude are the names, the unofficial names, of the lions that stand guard in front of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street in New York.

02:58.276 --> 03:02.385
And it's very interesting and very timely, I think, how they got those names.

03:02.365 --> 03:16.921
During the Great Depression, a very charismatic mayor of New York City, Fiorello LaGuardia, called the Little Flower, used to give a Sunday night radio address to the people to try and prop them up, to encourage them to survive the great ordeal.

03:17.481 --> 03:29.014
And he unfailingly ended this broadcast with these inspirational words, basically, we will all make it through these very difficult times, what we must exercise are patience and fortitude.

03:28.994 --> 03:36.083
And it was these stirring words and these virtues that became the unofficial names of these lions, which had been there since 1911.

03:36.404 --> 03:44.895
And when you think of so many libraries that have lions as guardians at the gates of knowledge, it's not just the New York Public Library, of course.

03:44.915 --> 03:48.400
You can look at the old British Museum in England, they have lions.

03:49.161 --> 03:51.383
Boston Public Library, we have a pair of lions.

03:51.464 --> 03:55.609
The Morgan Library in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, lions as guardians.

03:55.589 --> 04:04.561
This seemed to me quite an interesting and worthwhile image and a metaphor to use as a title that could be used for a book that had a collective thrust.

04:05.081 --> 04:07.024
In Gentle Madness, the premise was straightforward.

04:07.064 --> 04:10.328
It was collecting as a preservation medium.

04:10.829 --> 04:19.200
Now, as you have correctly pointed out, this book takes in the much broader concept of book culture, libraries being a very major element in that exploration.

04:19.180 --> 04:19.801
Right.

04:19.821 --> 04:25.168
And you were inspired to do this, or you got the idea for this theme at some point as you were doing the first book, isn't that right?

04:25.368 --> 04:36.442
I try very shamelessly, actually, to make what I hope is a seamless connection between Gentle Madness and Patience and Fortitude.

04:36.842 --> 04:48.377
And it came, really, what I call the great epiphanous moment came during the frantic rush to close the galleys for Gentle Madness, and this was in April of 1995, and it happened that I needed very desperately to...

04:48.712 --> 04:54.742
To get a bibliographical detail, I won't go into all the minutiae of it, but I had to get hold of a book.

04:54.802 --> 04:57.948
It was the Pepys Catalogue from 1911 to the Pepys Library.

04:58.909 --> 05:01.634
Very rare edition for the Pepys Catalogue.

05:01.654 --> 05:06.342
There was an earlier edition from 1859, the later one, but I had to have this one from 1911.

05:06.703 --> 05:09.788
I couldn't find it at Harvard where I do most of my research.

05:09.808 --> 05:12.272
I couldn't find it at the Boston Public Library.

05:12.252 --> 05:19.581
Finally, I go to the Boston Athenaeum, which has been a work in progress, as I say, on this new book since 1812 when it was established.

05:19.641 --> 05:22.424
It's a private library, but a distinguished library.

05:22.484 --> 05:23.385
Anyone can join.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.710
You have to have a passion for books and for research and for learning and for reading.

05:28.311 --> 05:29.292
It's a reader's library.

05:29.733 --> 05:33.117
Well, there in the basement on a dusty shelf, I found the three volumes.

05:33.737 --> 05:35.680
And as I look at them, they have been uncut.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.402
The pages have never been opened.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.364
I looked at the paste down in the rear.

05:39.404 --> 05:40.926
It's never been signed out.

05:40.906 --> 05:47.536
And as I am now signing these books out at the front desk, and we still did sign out, there was no scanner there at that time.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.361
There now is a scanner at the Athenaeum.

05:51.082 --> 05:54.727
I say something really dumb like, wow, 84 years.

05:54.747 --> 05:55.168
This was 1995.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.011
84 years.

05:57.411 --> 05:58.854
These books have never been read.

05:58.994 --> 06:00.336
They've never been borrowed.

06:00.556 --> 06:02.820
Who do you suppose they bought these books for anyway?

06:02.860 --> 06:07.487
And the gentleman who's signing me out pauses momentarily, looks up.

06:07.467 --> 06:12.894
fastens his unblinking eyes on my, and he says, we bought them for you, Mr. Bassbanks.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.735
I thought about this.

06:14.035 --> 06:15.077
It was one of these moments.

06:15.757 --> 06:21.164
They did buy these books for me, even though nobody for close to 100 years had ever used them.

06:21.505 --> 06:33.880
And this is a very pertinent issue, one that I explore in this book, because at many libraries throughout the United States today, you will find that they use their computers, and they will see that if a book hasn't been read or borrowed in, say, five years...

06:33.860 --> 06:39.189
five years, at many places, it is a candidate now for deaccession or discarding.

06:39.870 --> 06:42.355
And here is a case where they don't throw anything away.

06:42.375 --> 06:50.248
I write about academic libraries in this new book, Harvard University, which has 14.1 million books.

06:51.072 --> 06:57.241
The policy at Harvard is there is no such thing as a dead book at Harvard, and I believe there is no such thing as a dead book.

06:57.281 --> 07:01.988
It's just waiting for the next reader to come along and to discover it.

07:02.008 --> 07:10.560
Well, let's talk about that, because you get into this in the book about just what is a library, really, and different ideas about what a library is and what it should be.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.842
It's a very perceptive question.

07:11.862 --> 07:12.303
Thank you.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.467
It is really, I think, the essential theme of the book.

07:15.488 --> 07:17.190
A library is more than a building.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.273
It's an institution that has evolved...

07:19.253 --> 07:25.109
Certainly over the last 4,000 years, but for my purposes, the arc of this book, it's very clear.

07:25.269 --> 07:35.035
I started in Alexandria in Egypt in 300 BC, and I went, and this is why I call these places book places and not necessarily libraries.

07:35.015 --> 07:38.680
because there is no ancient library from Alexandria still standing.

07:38.820 --> 07:43.526
There are really no relics, but it is certainly an essential book place.

07:44.127 --> 07:44.968
And I travel there.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.713
I make my pilgrimage, and I write about what began there.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.678
And then I go full circle, 600 pages or so later into the book.

07:53.058 --> 07:58.365
I come back to Alexandria, where they are about to open a 21st century library.

07:58.385 --> 08:03.452
And then through the course of the book, I do tend to meander as I write.

08:03.432 --> 08:15.687
discussion as well as in my writing but i do tend to travel around and we discuss the evolution of the library as an institution not only as a place to contain books but to nurture scholarship to preserve our culture

08:15.920 --> 08:17.102
Well, let's begin with Alexandria.

08:17.122 --> 08:20.789
What did it represent, that ancient Alexandria library?

08:21.450 --> 08:26.799
It was really the first great library in what we could call a modern sense.

08:26.819 --> 08:36.156
I mean, there had undoubtedly been repositories in Egypt and Mesopotamia, libraries that were 1,000, 1,500 years older, but in Alexandria...

08:36.136 --> 08:46.161
It was not only a collection of books, not just religious books by any means, but works of the intellect, and also a place where scholars gathered to do research.

08:46.241 --> 08:52.457
People came there to work and to study and to produce new works, and the original intention was

08:52.437 --> 08:59.625
It seems preposterous today to think this is possible, but to gather all of the world's knowledge and store it under one roof.

08:59.645 --> 09:03.188
And they really made a very determined effort to do this.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.551
And, in fact, they probably did it for the period of the time.

09:05.591 --> 09:12.658
But this is the great example of Alexandria, this beacon of knowledge and this repository of the intellect.

09:13.459 --> 09:21.027
And the modern library has to take into account technology, and that's a subject that you get in, how technology is changing reality.

09:21.007 --> 09:22.651
What the library is all about.

09:22.691 --> 09:24.135
Is it about books?

09:24.236 --> 09:25.659
Or is it about other kinds of media?

09:25.880 --> 09:30.051
Again, we come back, I think, to the resonance of the title, which is Patience and Fortitude.

09:30.753 --> 09:33.380
These are interesting times that we live in.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.147
It happens to be a new millennium and a new century.

09:36.127 --> 09:46.119
But we are at a time in history where the book is threatened, at least, to become a marginal object, the printed book.

09:46.139 --> 09:46.880
Is the book going?

09:46.900 --> 09:57.612
And that's why when you ask that question about this epiphanous moment, when I see a book that they've saved for 84 years, even though nobody has ever asked for it before,

09:57.592 --> 10:08.325
We have instances where books are being, I hate to use the word dumped, but I guess there's not a better word to use for that particular phenomenon.

10:09.186 --> 10:14.452
And I do cite the instance in here of the San Francisco Public Library story, which Nicholson... Tell that story, yeah.

10:14.472 --> 10:22.502
Well, as many of your listeners might know, Nicholson Baker, who also had a book come out earlier this year called Double Fold on another issue...

10:22.482 --> 10:32.795
But he wrote a piece in the New Yorker about 1996 or so, reporting on what had then been something that people hadn't even known about.

10:32.815 --> 10:39.244
The New Main Library, called the New Main, had just opened in 1996 in San Francisco.

10:39.284 --> 10:43.309
The voters of San Francisco had approved a $140 million bond issue.

10:43.778 --> 10:48.789
to build a brand new library, and the city was overwhelmingly in support of it.

10:49.029 --> 10:57.387
But when the library opened, lo and behold, even though it had more square footage than the building it replaced, there was less room in there to store books.

10:58.570 --> 11:04.302
And as a consequence, at least 200,000 books, perhaps as many as 500,000 books,

11:04.282 --> 11:06.946
They weren't even catalogued or formally deaccessioned.

11:06.966 --> 11:10.411
They were just taken off and sent to a landfill without anybody knowing about it.

11:10.932 --> 11:12.614
So Baker wrote about this in The New Yorker.

11:12.794 --> 11:14.797
What was in their place?

11:14.817 --> 11:15.298
A space.

11:15.398 --> 11:16.300
It's a beautiful building.

11:16.380 --> 11:17.201
I mean, it's an atrium.

11:17.221 --> 11:18.623
There's a six-story atrium.

11:19.044 --> 11:19.464
Gorgeous.

11:19.524 --> 11:20.486
It's a gorgeous building.

11:20.546 --> 11:23.530
I don't mean to denigrate the skill of the architect.

11:23.550 --> 11:28.838
She did a marvelous job in building a building, but they really... And this was a very mindful...

11:28.818 --> 11:41.262
sort of departure that the people who had conceived of this library, the gentleman who was the librarian at the time of the San Francisco Public Library, a gentleman by the name of Kenneth Dowell, had written a book called The Electronic Library.

11:41.723 --> 11:47.033
His vision was, and this is shared by a lot of people in the information world, that the future is not in printed books.

11:47.574 --> 11:51.822
The future is perhaps in the Internet and electronic services.

11:51.802 --> 12:04.137
But when this became known, when it was learned that these books were gone, I mean, I interview a famous, wonderful short story writer and essayist, Tilly Olson, who lives in San Francisco.

12:04.558 --> 12:13.008
Now, this woman has never finished high school, does not have a formal earned degree from a college, but she has multiple honorary degrees.

12:13.048 --> 12:14.670
Wonderful writer.

12:14.650 --> 12:21.224
Perhaps her best-known book is called Silences, and she mentions that her university is the public library.

12:21.304 --> 12:25.933
She did all of her work at libraries all over the United States, but particularly in San Francisco.

12:26.534 --> 12:32.587
She was a great supporter of building a new library, but the day it opened, and she went in, and she said, my God, what happened to the books?

12:32.827 --> 12:34.110
Where are the books?

12:34.090 --> 12:38.019
And then she became a great critic of what had happened, and I interview her.

12:38.059 --> 12:39.382
She's one of multiple people.

12:40.244 --> 12:43.731
You contrasted also an example of a library that's different than that.

12:43.751 --> 12:44.854
It's a New York library.

12:44.874 --> 12:53.112
I take what we might regard as an east side, west side approach to public libraries, and it's just a matter of geography.

12:53.092 --> 12:55.855
in a chapter I call The People's Palace.

12:56.776 --> 13:17.619
I do take a look at both the Boston Public Library and the New York Public Library, but I could easily have included the Cleveland Public Library or the Los Angeles Public Library, great, great municipal institutions, public libraries for the people, distinct from the national libraries as another institution, which I write about, an academic library.

13:17.660 --> 13:18.981
So I do deal with these issues.

13:18.961 --> 13:19.842
in a different sense.

13:20.223 --> 13:25.751
But in Boston we have 8 million books, perhaps 20 million objects.

13:26.172 --> 13:32.381
The New York Public Library is the largest, greatest, most accessible public library in the world.

13:33.082 --> 13:35.866
And, of course, there the books are treasured and they are kept.

13:36.187 --> 13:38.470
I'm not saying the books are not treasured in San Francisco.

13:39.031 --> 13:40.433
They did go through a period there.

13:40.493 --> 13:47.584
There was a post-occupancy evaluation study, and they have concluded that to make this library a truly modern library,

13:47.564 --> 13:53.215
They're going to have to spend $28 million, and most of this money is going to be spent to allow for the storage of books.

13:54.056 --> 14:03.534
Okay, for all you book lovers out there, and I know that there are many of you out there in this audience, we will be taking your questions for Nicholas Bazbaines when we return from a short break.

14:04.917 --> 14:05.117
Thank you.

14:16.876 --> 14:36.235
Thank you.

14:50.643 --> 15:06.694
Thank you.

15:27.734 --> 15:28.295
Welcome back.

15:28.396 --> 15:30.681
I'm Lynn Neary sitting in for Diane Rehm.

15:30.761 --> 15:41.506
Nicholas Bazbaines is with me today in the studio, and we are talking about his new book, Patience and Fortitude, a roving chronicle of book people, book places, and book culture.

15:41.546 --> 15:45.154
I guess I wanted to ask you, who are the book people in this book?

15:45.174 --> 15:46.738
Your first book was about collectors.

15:46.718 --> 15:49.984
And you touch on collectors again in this book also.

15:50.244 --> 15:53.370
I rather shamelessly have a chapter in here I call Madness Redux.

15:54.131 --> 15:55.173
And that's the third chapter.

15:55.213 --> 16:01.064
And I like to say these are six people who I would have included in Gentle Madness if I had only known about them at the time.

16:01.585 --> 16:06.494
So there is one chapter in here that is quite pointedly about the collector.

16:06.514 --> 16:08.237
I like to think the scholar-collector.

16:08.217 --> 16:17.759
But as I said earlier, in this book, I decided to try and explore the full world, the broader spectrum, not only the book collector, but the scholar bookseller.

16:18.220 --> 16:27.441
I have people like Roger Stoddard, who's the curator of rare books at the Houghton Library at Harvard University, tell me quite seriously everything that he knows about rare books he's learned from booksellers.

16:27.421 --> 16:46.884
When you think about people whose job it is, as John Hill Britton said, to see value where others see only piles of rubbish, to go and find obscure, we're not talking about Shakespeare, everybody knows Shakespeare is fantastic, but to find things, things obscure, obscure materials, and to determine their significance and their importance and why they should be in a great research collection.

16:46.904 --> 16:49.868
This is what many, many booksellers through history have done.

16:49.848 --> 16:57.918
Well, you visit some of the people's favorite bookstores, and one that you write about that I'm more familiar with, and the others is The Strand in New York.

16:58.299 --> 16:59.460
Isn't that a fabulous place?

16:59.520 --> 17:02.424
And again, we talk about it's not libraries only.

17:02.484 --> 17:06.629
It's places like The Strand Bookstore and our Powell's out in Oregon.

17:07.130 --> 17:09.974
But The Strand, like yourself, is one that I'm very familiar with.

17:10.034 --> 17:17.463
I've been going there for many years doing research in The Strand Bookstore, you know, this place that doesn't have any air conditioning, any heat.

17:17.944 --> 17:19.686
The paint is peeling off the walls.

17:19.666 --> 17:23.209
The owner tells me every time I try to clean the place up, I lose business.

17:24.330 --> 17:27.953
One of the reasons being because there's such a constant turnover.

17:27.973 --> 17:37.122
The first thing I do whenever I go into a new city, a city I haven't been, or a city I haven't been to in a while, I always try to find the second-hand bookstore.

17:37.682 --> 17:41.165
I know the antiquarian booksellers, and I certainly regard them equally.

17:41.205 --> 17:43.888
It's like, which of your children do you love more?

17:43.948 --> 17:47.631
I love them all equally, but I also want to find the second-hand bookstores.

17:47.611 --> 17:57.801
where you go in and you see things that are out of print, see things you've never heard of before, and you know instantly you have to have them, and you have to buy them and make them part of your library.

17:57.821 --> 18:06.530
The Strand has, I guess they say, 13 1⁄2 miles of books piled everywhere, and it is really a crazy but I think also essential place.

18:06.550 --> 18:12.876
I think the daughter of the store's owner said something like, more books come into the store every day than go out.

18:12.856 --> 18:16.641
She almost made it like a biological statement.

18:16.681 --> 18:19.985
We don't know how this happens, but they seem to reproduce it.

18:20.005 --> 18:21.346
And we don't really know how that happens.

18:21.807 --> 18:29.777
And there was another bookstore owner you spoke with, I don't think it was the Strand, who said that he doesn't trust a bookstore that's neat.

18:29.977 --> 18:33.902
Peter Howard, owner of Serendipity Books in Berkeley, California.

18:33.922 --> 18:40.770
I think that every bibliophile deserves to treat themselves at least to one visit to Serendipity in Berkeley, California.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.732
Pierre is really a one-man show.

18:42.812 --> 18:49.138
I mean, he has a few people working for him, but he has a half a million books in here, all selected and culled, he says.

18:49.158 --> 18:57.386
And he said what makes his bookstore, his operation, aptly named Serendipity, work is the fact that he constantly has turnover.

18:57.426 --> 18:59.528
You go in, the books are piled everywhere.

18:59.548 --> 19:00.689
You sit in these little chairs.

19:01.130 --> 19:04.112
And he says, I mistrust stories that are neat as a pin.

19:05.273 --> 19:09.778
And I think anyone would agree that Serendipity is not neat as a pin, just the contrary.

19:09.878 --> 19:09.998
Right.

19:09.978 --> 19:13.886
What about private libraries and the tradition of private libraries?

19:14.346 --> 19:32.762
I really dealt with the private library more in A Gentle Madness, although I do with that chapter I mentioned, Madness Redux, give you six notable collectors who have followed the cycle of books that I tried to establish as a subtext in Gentle Madness to wit.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.612
We need two kinds of collector.

19:34.632 --> 19:39.477
We need the kind of collector who was one of the people I write about in Gentle Madness, a man named Abel Berland.

19:39.517 --> 19:45.284
His books just sold at Christie's in New York two and a half weeks ago for $14 million.

19:45.745 --> 19:49.169
One of the books, A First Folio of Shakespeare, went for $6.2 million.

19:49.489 --> 19:56.738
I was asked by a reporter, why is it that somebody would spend, this was before the book was sold, it was expected it would get $3 million.

19:56.918 --> 20:00.522
Why would somebody want to spend $1 million, $2 million, $3 million dollars

20:00.502 --> 20:05.529
for a book that contains a text that anyone who knows how to use the Internet can download for free.

20:05.569 --> 20:12.019
I mean, I believe you can go to the Internet and find the text of Hamlet or Macbeth or Romeo and Juliet, and it's a fair question.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.566
But I think we are talking now about a book that has some iconic value.

20:17.166 --> 20:24.417
When I touch that first folio of Shakespeare, printed in 1623, and fully 20 of the plays in there come to us from no other source,

20:24.397 --> 20:26.039
I mean, you wouldn't have The Tempest.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.721
You wouldn't have Macbeth.

20:27.761 --> 20:29.543
You wouldn't have Antony and Cleopatra.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.466
You wouldn't have those plays if it doesn't come to us from this text.

20:33.047 --> 20:37.973
When I touch this book, I'm touching something that brings me as close to William Shakespeare as I'm ever going to get.

20:37.993 --> 20:38.753
And there's a value.

20:38.793 --> 20:40.395
There's an iconic value to that.

20:41.036 --> 20:44.220
And we need these people to preserve these objects.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.102
Now, that's one kind of collector that I write about.

20:46.122 --> 20:50.607
But then there's the other kind of collector, like a woman I write about, Diana Korzenek.

20:50.789 --> 20:51.791
from Massachusetts.

20:52.232 --> 21:02.051
She used to go out to all the flea markets in New England, and for $5 and $10 she would find all of these art implements that teachers used in the 19th century, things that nobody had ever heard of before.

21:02.071 --> 21:10.367
She was a teacher at Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, and she put together a collection that she now gave to the Huntington Library in California,

21:10.347 --> 21:15.294
which is an essential element now that makes sense as a collection.

21:16.115 --> 21:21.863
If you were to take one item out of there, you would never have heard of the title before, but what matters is the collection.

21:21.924 --> 21:28.072
I call this a synergistic kind of a collection where the total, where the sum is greater than the individual parts.

21:28.513 --> 21:32.018
Its importance and relevance is as a research resource.

21:31.998 --> 21:37.524
Another collection that you wrote about that was interesting was a collection of children's books.

21:38.145 --> 21:40.568
There's a collection of children's books in New York.

21:40.608 --> 21:44.112
Oh, well, that's a fabulous, that's a really very poignant story.

21:44.152 --> 21:46.174
I call that chapter Many Years.

21:46.234 --> 21:57.347
For my listeners out there of Greek extraction, as am I, I'm Greek-American, it comes from a phrase called krona pola, which means many years.

21:57.715 --> 22:02.202
I really don't explain what that means in the chapter until the very end.

22:02.944 --> 22:03.985
It's a very poignant story.

22:04.005 --> 22:10.396
It's about a gentleman by the name of Lloyd Coatsen, a very prominent Los Angeles philanthropist, businessman.

22:10.496 --> 22:20.112
He founded the Neutrogena Company, suffered a very horrible personal loss of his wife and a son, and I won't go into the details here, but...

22:20.092 --> 22:26.888
One of the elements we look for in the building of a great library is not merely the means or the knowledge, but the motivation.

22:27.891 --> 22:35.248
And what Mr. Coatsin did was put together a library that now numbers 80,000 volumes in 36 languages,

22:35.718 --> 22:55.056
and persuaded his alma mater, Princeton University, to not only take these books, but he built a small wing to the Firestone Library, endowed it with funds, pays for the staff, but to persuade an Ivy League institution to take 80,000 books in a subject that doesn't support the curriculum in any way.

22:55.096 --> 22:56.377
It didn't then, and now it does.

22:56.477 --> 22:57.498
I mean, children's literature.

22:57.939 --> 23:04.645
And not only to accept the books, but to establish outreach programs where you go out into the communities and where you invite people

23:04.625 --> 23:10.815
people from neighborhoods to come in, and children to come in and interact with these books.

23:10.835 --> 23:19.269
So these private collections frequently are a cornerstone of what then becomes a public... A public resource.

23:19.550 --> 23:21.553
Part of a public library.

23:21.573 --> 23:22.414
Very, very often.

23:22.775 --> 23:24.718
Can I tell you one quick Lloyd Coatsen story?

23:25.179 --> 23:27.122
I really wanted to have him in Gentle Madness.

23:27.182 --> 23:27.843
I knew about him.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.189
But at that point in the early 90s, he was still building the library.

23:31.169 --> 23:32.251
The book came out.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.735
I was signing books at a fair in Los Angeles.

23:35.536 --> 23:37.359
This gentleman came up, introduced himself.

23:37.379 --> 23:38.501
We'd only talked on the phone.

23:38.621 --> 23:39.983
I said, Mr. Coatsen, how are you?

23:40.704 --> 23:41.625
He said, Mr. Basman.

23:41.646 --> 23:45.852
He said, my friends can't believe I had a chance to be in a General Madness, and I turned it down.

23:46.393 --> 23:47.174
And I said, well, guess what?

23:47.194 --> 23:48.136
You've got another chance.

23:48.436 --> 23:52.042
And thus he gets into patience and fortitude.

23:52.062 --> 23:55.928
I really think it's a very poignant story, and thank you for asking about it.

23:55.908 --> 23:59.735
Let's take some calls because we do have some book lovers on the line now.

23:59.955 --> 24:01.417
Joseph in Cleveland, Ohio.

24:02.299 --> 24:02.960
Yes, hello.

24:03.200 --> 24:03.601
Hi, Joseph.

24:04.102 --> 24:18.927
Yeah, Dr. Besbaines, I wanted to know if you could repeat the subtitle of Patience and Fortitude and the title of the third book in the trilogy, if you know that yet.

24:19.688 --> 24:20.650
And then finally...

24:21.068 --> 24:27.366
If you could talk about how you developed your fascination with libraries and with books for that matter.

24:27.785 --> 24:29.246
Okay.

24:29.266 --> 24:30.367
The first two are very easy.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.448
Patience and Fortitude.

24:31.488 --> 24:38.074
The subtitle is A Roving Chronicle of Book People, Book Places, and Book Culture.

24:38.895 --> 24:46.722
The title of the work in progress is Life Beyond Life, colon, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World.

24:47.463 --> 24:51.106
And allow me, there's a very cute story, interesting story.

24:51.606 --> 24:55.390
When I submitted the manuscript for Patience and Fortitude, it was 18 chapters.

24:55.470 --> 24:57.792
This book now is 12 chapters.

24:57.772 --> 25:12.793
And I had made a pretty dramatic departure in the final section of the book, which takes in the issues of the destruction of books through history, the destruction of cultures, and to demonstrate as a premise that if you really choose to destroy a people,

25:12.773 --> 25:35.507
as the carthaginians did for instance you have to destroy their books and we've had we've had examples of this in recent times in sarajevo where in one night in 1992 1992 the national library was targeted deliberately destroyed 1.2 million books in an attempt not only to to use the phrase uh ethnic cleanse the people to to to to kill the people but to destroy

25:35.487 --> 25:37.029
the record of their culture.

25:37.049 --> 25:38.751
So I get into these questions.

25:38.811 --> 25:43.997
I try to do a lot of stories through history, a lot of contemporary stories in the attempts to recede these libraries.

25:44.017 --> 25:52.706
When I talk about preservation issues, I will get into the whole concept of the electronic book and the printed book in greater depth than I do in this book.

25:53.187 --> 25:58.693
But the title, Life Beyond Life, comes from the famous quote in John Milton's Aria Bajitica, where

25:58.673 --> 25:59.935
Let me see if I can get it right.

25:59.996 --> 26:05.947
Books being the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and treasured upon a purpose to a life beyond life.

26:06.929 --> 26:07.269
That's beautiful.

26:07.289 --> 26:07.610
Thank you.

26:07.810 --> 26:08.131
Thank you.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.454
I think so.

26:09.474 --> 26:14.944
This book, Patience and Fortitude, almost was titled Life Beyond Life, but I thought it more appropriate for the next book.

26:15.127 --> 26:20.598
And just, Joseph, I'm going to ask Mr. Bazbaines to answer your second question.

26:20.659 --> 26:21.741
Thanks so much for your call.

26:21.901 --> 26:22.683
Thank you, Joseph.

26:22.703 --> 26:25.829
How did you develop this lifelong love fascination?

26:25.849 --> 26:27.072
Do we have two hours for this?

26:27.473 --> 26:28.174
No, no, we don't.

26:28.274 --> 26:34.367
Briefly, I was a book review editor for 13 years in Massachusetts.

26:34.347 --> 26:50.542
One of the things that I did every week, unfailingly, was to do an interview with a major author, not unlike what we're doing right now, and write a column, a feature article, which I wrote for my newspaper, then the Worcester Telegram, and later for 22 other newspapers around the country.

26:50.562 --> 26:56.768
And I would always ask these authors to sign or inscribe, mainly to inscribe personally, the copy of the book.

26:57.668 --> 26:58.930
I became the bibliophile.

26:58.970 --> 27:03.814
I went over the cliff when I would interview Joseph Heller, for instance, about the new novel,

27:03.794 --> 27:05.996
He had just written, God knows.

27:06.076 --> 27:08.759
Well, I had to go out and get a copy of Catch-22, of course.

27:08.799 --> 27:12.262
Arthur Miller about time bends, which was his memoir.

27:12.322 --> 27:14.424
Well, I would have to go out and get Death of a Salesman.

27:15.065 --> 27:22.151
And I became this fanatical book collector, which is not a good thing to do if you're also a book critic and you're getting review copies.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.574
You're acquiring thousands of books.

27:24.714 --> 27:32.181
And then my inclination as a journalist led me to write about this whole book world, this book culture.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.506
author Nicholas Bazbaines.

27:35.007 --> 27:37.791
I'm Lynn Neary, and you're listening to The Diane Rehm Show.

27:38.792 --> 27:45.101
If you have any questions for Mr. Bazbaines, or if you would like to join our discussion, give us a call at 1-800-433-8850.

27:47.704 --> 27:49.567
And Jeff in Princeton, New Jersey, hello.

27:49.587 --> 27:52.711
Hi, I'm so excited to hear you on the air.

27:52.731 --> 27:57.818
I was interested to hear you talk about the Children's Library here in Princeton.

27:58.138 --> 28:00.902
I'm a graduate student in Classics at the University, and my wife works for

28:01.540 --> 28:05.065
the Princeton YWCA, so they take kids there quite often.

28:06.468 --> 28:08.471
That's exactly what Mr. Coatsen wants to happen.

28:08.771 --> 28:09.713
And the kids love it.

28:10.153 --> 28:10.974
Excellent.

28:10.994 --> 28:15.922
My question has to do with the afterlife of books that were once public.

28:16.583 --> 28:20.128
And I guess that's sort of a comment, and then to hear your response.

28:20.609 --> 28:25.196
I see the afterlife sort of as, you know, can be virtuous or also horrible.

28:25.617 --> 28:27.700
And the virtuous one is people like me who are

28:28.169 --> 28:29.611
covetous of anything we can get.

28:29.791 --> 28:34.496
And one of our greatest sources is ex-library books.

28:34.516 --> 28:48.873
And sometimes I'll find the most incredible resource that, you know, from the turn of the century or even earlier for classics that I never thought I would find that, you know, I think some poor college just will never have those, but I do now at least.

28:49.454 --> 28:57.383
But then the destructive side, there's an article by Robert Darnton called The Great Book Massacre.

28:57.937 --> 29:06.011
And he talks about the destruction of newspapers and other historical records because libraries don't think they'll last.

29:06.031 --> 29:09.958
They get put on the celluloid and then the celluloid itself disintegrates.

29:10.659 --> 29:14.967
And so, anyway, I wondered what, you know, if you see,

29:15.183 --> 29:19.547
how you see the afterlife of ex-public books.

29:19.567 --> 29:20.108
Thanks, Jeff.

29:20.128 --> 29:24.212
Jeff, those are excellent questions, and you anticipate in many ways my next book.

29:24.753 --> 29:32.240
In fact, one of the chapters that I had written, which I am now updating for the next book and will be in there, is one I call shelf life.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.963
But I love your expression, the afterlife of books, too.

29:35.343 --> 29:36.204
I wrote that one down.

29:36.765 --> 29:43.131
But I begin that chapter by noting that one of my sub-collections, a collection within a collection, is ex-libris books.

29:43.415 --> 29:56.007
Books that I, like yourself, go out to various flea markets or go to library sales and find for 25 cents or 50 cents or $5 or whatever, but books that have been deemed irrelevant to the collections and disposable.

29:56.408 --> 29:57.751
And remarkable books.

29:57.771 --> 30:00.355
And there are all kinds of horror stories of people finding.

30:01.037 --> 30:08.791
I just heard a story of a book that came out of a library up in Vermont that actually had an inscription from Mark Twain in it, you know, that it was not in the greatest of shape.

30:09.593 --> 30:16.105
I think that these various places do supply people like yourself and me.

30:16.085 --> 30:20.331
a means of finding books and rescuing books that are headed for the landfill.

30:21.352 --> 30:32.667
I do have a chapter in this new book I call Deep Sleep, and it takes on the rather esoteric subject of off-site storage, but it is a very fascinating concept, I think, and you do this at Princeton.

30:32.707 --> 30:38.295
In fact, I think Princeton has now gotten together with the New York Public Library and Columbia, I believe,

30:38.275 --> 30:46.445
to set up an off-site storage facility to place books that are not in great demand, but books that they do not want to dispose of.

30:46.545 --> 30:53.033
And so I do get into the politics of this in the current book, Patients in Fortitude, and we'll get into it in greater depth in the next book.

30:53.053 --> 30:53.994
Thanks very much, Jeff.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.479
Storage really is a problem for libraries.

30:58.499 --> 30:59.560
Well, storage and the price.

30:59.661 --> 31:00.602
I mean, what it costs.

31:01.303 --> 31:04.466
But, of course, we have to decide, are these artifacts worth saving?

31:05.548 --> 31:07.590
So we have to make it an issue, I guess.

31:08.110 --> 31:09.812
Okay, Paul in Rochester, New York, hello.

31:10.073 --> 31:10.754
Yes, hi there.

31:10.934 --> 31:14.820
I have a comment about, or at least a question, about W.H.

31:14.900 --> 31:21.550
Auden's famous observation that some books are undeservedly forgotten, none are undeservedly remembered.

31:22.531 --> 31:25.275
I'm wondering, is there such a thing as deservedness in books?

31:26.656 --> 31:36.631
Well, you know, if people were making these moral judgments, then that book I found in the Boston Athenaeum would have been dumped 75 years ago.

31:36.711 --> 31:39.796
It was exactly that anecdote that led me to Carl.

31:39.816 --> 31:54.418
And so, you know, I like to withhold the moral judgment, and I don't think we have that right to make the moral judgment on a book because it hasn't been used in five years, so therefore we will take it upon ourselves to save the sword space and get rid of it.

31:54.668 --> 31:56.270
I think just the opposite.

31:56.310 --> 31:57.212
It's our obligation.

31:57.472 --> 32:01.117
And that's the point I make so forcefully at the end of the prologue of my new book.

32:01.177 --> 32:03.020
I mean, this book had been passed on to us.

32:03.561 --> 32:14.837
I felt like the collective hands of the great book people through history had reached out through, as I say, the swirling eddy of the ages and placed in my hands the precious gift of a book.

32:15.298 --> 32:18.162
It might have seemed irrelevant to somebody 25 years ago

32:18.462 --> 32:25.249
But there were people, there were custodians, there were keepers of books who kept it for me and keep countless others for countless other people.

32:25.330 --> 32:27.353
Thanks so much for your call.

32:27.513 --> 32:28.334
We're going to take a short break.

32:28.354 --> 32:43.834
When we get back, I want to get more into that whole discussion about what a library should be, because I think it was a revelation for me and maybe for other people who aren't close to the world that maybe books aren't as valued as they once were in libraries.

32:44.114 --> 32:49.341
So when we come back, more of our discussion and more questions for Nicholas Bazbaines.

32:49.501 --> 32:49.701
Thank you.

32:50.609 --> 33:15.800
.

33:15.820 --> 33:15.840

33:18.368 --> 33:26.339
