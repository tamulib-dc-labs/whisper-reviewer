WEBVTT

00:08.620 --> 00:11.707
We did all of Egypt.

00:12.850 --> 00:14.213
We went down the Nile.

00:14.274 --> 00:16.960
We spent over six weeks, as it turned out, in Cairo.

00:17.501 --> 00:25.701
We were extending, extending, extending things on and on, and then went into the Sinai.

00:25.934 --> 00:37.869
At dawn one day we climbed to the top of the view of the General Russo, Mount Sinai.

00:38.049 --> 00:45.539
And from there you see the Gulf of Aqaba on one side and Gulf of Sierra on the other.

00:45.559 --> 00:51.807
It's purquoise sparking water from the red rock and the light.

00:51.787 --> 01:04.801
There's a line in the Zohar, the Kabbalistic book, about the light, the light is the light is the eye.

01:05.402 --> 01:11.288
It's a commentary on Genesis, and it begins with a commentary on the phrase, what there is light.

01:11.869 --> 01:14.892
And that light, I really never got over it.

01:14.872 --> 01:16.534
traveling in the desert.

01:16.594 --> 01:19.759
We traveled in the desert for about two weeks.

01:21.241 --> 01:26.168
And I went diving.

01:26.188 --> 01:33.418
I went diving down the wall at the Sharm el-Sheep at the tip of the Spine I've lived on.

01:33.439 --> 01:34.500
And that light

01:34.733 --> 01:43.022
It extends down to where normally you lose color at 80 feet or so.

01:43.042 --> 01:48.969
But it continues to sparkle, to light up the cow, to light up the fish.

01:49.269 --> 01:58.720
It's a wonderful guy and informed by this light which makes the visibility of 250 feet.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.483
Having done that, I really felt

02:02.628 --> 02:07.255
infused, haunted by light.

02:07.275 --> 02:21.615
In any case, we ended up by crossing the Egyptian army line, which was in the days when Suez was being returned to Egypt by the Israelis who had taken it.

02:22.304 --> 02:30.011
We maneuvered our way, military bureaucrat by military bureaucrat, through the Egyptian army line and got over the border.

02:30.371 --> 02:35.396
Took the last bus across the Negev to Jerusalem.

02:35.696 --> 02:39.259
We got to Jerusalem in the morning.

02:39.279 --> 02:50.069
And Jerusalem is high and the air is here in the early morning.

02:50.089 --> 02:51.670
And the sun was

02:53.641 --> 03:21.252
glinting on all this rose-colored stone that the old city and the gates of the old city and the buildings in the new city are all constructed of absolutely sparkly so it was impossible to sleep because that same that same that same light coming coming so to speak from heaven would continue to inform the landscape wherever you went so we walked through

03:22.868 --> 03:43.003
Through the Jaffa Gate and through the screen of David over to the Damascus Gate, the Damascus Gate is somehow the replication of every set that every Warner Brothers movie in 1940 tried to somehow reproduce.

03:42.983 --> 04:00.408
full of people herding goats under the crenellated towers and people pushing wheelbarrows full of cardamom and women in chanjures and veterans in headdresses.

04:00.548 --> 04:07.118
And you're even supplied with music since everybody's playing tapes of the latest chanjures.

04:07.098 --> 04:10.582
and to catch all that light.

04:10.923 --> 04:17.671
And I thought, I will hang up my shingle if I didn't write a novel sentence twice.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.812
I knew I had to write.

04:18.832 --> 04:24.899
I really felt that it was the city that I had to write about.

04:24.919 --> 04:29.104
I also knew, and we were kind of altered.

04:30.706 --> 04:34.050
It was imprinted within me.

04:34.604 --> 04:39.050
This is the place that stands outward into an urban heaven.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.212
This is the center of the world.

04:41.273 --> 04:49.485
This is where all those events that are supposed to control and define the human condition took place.

04:49.806 --> 05:00.841
So that it was not only a tremendous, there was not only a tremendous compulsion to write the novel but also a certain presumption in many ways to write it.

05:00.921 --> 05:04.206
But I felt that I was going to do it.

05:04.827 --> 05:07.911
And somehow I did.

05:08.331 --> 05:11.975
I'm not altogether sure how I came from one end of that book to the other.

05:12.576 --> 05:14.739
But there it seems to be.

05:16.040 --> 05:25.311
So I will, I now offer it to the world for what it's worth.

05:25.391 --> 05:28.675
I'll just read the beginning of it, if I may.

05:30.376 --> 05:38.387
And I thought about who the characters had to be, and I knew they had to be characters that I'd normally write about, marginal people, people connected to.

05:38.407 --> 05:49.182
The press, people whose business is informing the world about things they themselves hardly understand.

05:49.242 --> 05:52.266
Believe me, I include myself.

05:52.651 --> 05:58.020
and raising more questions and providing answers.

05:58.761 --> 06:01.225
So, once I had the characters in a way, I had the story.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.450
Jerusalem, 1992.

06:04.510 --> 06:13.344
That morning, Lucas was awakened by bells sounding across the shoulder of Venom from the Church of the Door Mission.

06:13.364 --> 06:19.975
At first light, there had been a Moitan's calling still on, insisting that prayer was better than sleep.

06:20.663 --> 06:24.188
The city was well supplied with divine servants.

06:24.208 --> 06:28.254
He climbed out of bed and went into the kitchen to brew Turkish coffee.

06:28.274 --> 06:34.542
As he stood in the window drinking it, the first train of the day rattled past, bound over the hills for Tel Aviv.

06:35.203 --> 06:41.452
It was a slow, decorous, colonial train, five cars and nearly empty coaches with dusty windows.

06:41.472 --> 06:45.237
Its diminishing rhythms made him aware of his own solitaire.

06:45.942 --> 06:54.993
When the train was gone, he saw the old man who lived in one of the Ottoman houses beside the tracks watering a trompet of kale in the early morning shade.

06:56.075 --> 07:02.543
The kale was deep green and fleshy against the limestone rubble from which it somehow grew.

07:02.563 --> 07:05.586
The old man wore a black pink cap.

07:05.606 --> 07:09.351
He had high cheekbones and a runny face like a Slavic peasant's.

07:10.006 --> 07:19.540
The sight of him made Lucas imagine vast solar fields along which trains ran, long lines of gray boxcars against the far horizon.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.663
Once Lucas dreamed of him.

07:21.683 --> 07:26.090
He had great fruit and toast for breakfast and read the morning's Jerusalem Post.

07:26.110 --> 07:32.580
A border policeman had been stabbed in a Nusrat camp in the Gaza Strip, was expected to recover.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.308
Three Palestinians had been shot to death by Shin Bet-hit squads, one in Rafa, two in Gaza City.

07:38.980 --> 07:45.308
Haradim in Jerusalem had demonstrated against the Hebrew University's archaeological dig near the Dung Gate.

07:45.328 --> 07:47.330
The ancient burial grounds were being uncovered.

07:48.151 --> 07:52.096
Jesse Jackson was threatening to organize a boycott against Major League Baseball.

07:53.097 --> 07:58.664
In India, Hindus and Muslims were fighting over a shrine that probably predated both their religions.

07:59.145 --> 08:04.691
And in a story from Yugoslavia, he saw again the phrase ethnic cleansing.

08:04.711 --> 08:08.616
He had come across the evocative expression once or twice during the winter.

08:09.068 --> 08:15.818
There was also a full-page story on the number of foreign pilgrims visiting the country for Passover and Western Holy Week.

08:15.838 --> 08:20.124
Lucas was surprised to find himself overtaken by the holidays.

08:20.144 --> 08:23.669
He dressed and took a second cup of coffee out on his tiny balcony.

08:23.690 --> 08:25.172
The day was innocently glorious.

08:25.352 --> 08:31.461
Spring sunshine scented the pines and sparkled on the stone walls of Emeka Reflame.

08:31.481 --> 08:36.949
For weeks, he had been postponing work on an article about the Sinai he had contracted to write for CondÃ© Nast.

08:37.503 --> 08:41.690
The deadline had passed the previous Friday, and before long, they would be phoning him for it.

08:42.271 --> 08:45.076
Still, the fine weather inclined him to truancy.

08:45.096 --> 08:53.149
When at last he went to his desk, his open appointment book confirmed the date, Easter Sunday in the Latin Church, and also the 16th of Nisan.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.415
Passover had arrived the day before.

08:56.435 --> 09:01.403
On a sudden impulse, Lucas decided to go over to the Church of the Holy Seventh.

09:01.423 --> 09:03.527
That one in road was nearly free of traffic,

09:03.845 --> 09:11.476
In spite of its elderly population, Lucas's neighborhood in the German colony was the most secular in the city, and his atmosphere was never one of piety.

09:12.398 --> 09:14.541
Old couples strode in the spring sunshine.

09:15.122 --> 09:20.690
The day before, he had seen a few young families loading their volvos for camping trips in the desert or the Galilee.

09:21.631 --> 09:31.185
But walking up the nearly deserted avenue past the terraces of the Cinematheque, under the ramparts of the Church of Scotland Hospice, adorned with its funny blue flag,

09:31.452 --> 09:35.218
He could feel the gravity of the ancient city across the canyons.

09:35.238 --> 09:38.643
A hundred tour buses were parked in the streets under the old city walls.

09:39.444 --> 09:46.354
At the distant Jaffa gate, he could see the swain forms of mounted policemen hurting a pressing crowd of bright pilgrims.

09:46.374 --> 09:51.702
At the other end of the fortress, a line of devotees toiled a single file up the slope to the Zion gate.

09:52.763 --> 10:00.615
He walked down into the shadow of the valley over the bridge by the Sultan's pool and past the Quranic verse carved in the shell of the Ottoman fountain.

10:00.916 --> 10:04.419
All that is created comes in water that reigns.

10:04.439 --> 10:09.084
Then, humbled by the looming walls, he trudged up the ascent to Zion.

10:09.104 --> 10:15.069
On the path to Zion Gate, he walked mainly among Orthodox Jewish men in black, bound for the Western Wall.

10:16.050 --> 10:21.035
Some of the Jews tried to converse with each other as they climbed, scrambling along the shoulder to keep pace.

10:21.835 --> 10:26.259
Besides Saharadim, there were a few German Catholics on the path.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.982
The Dermatian Abbey above them was a German church.

10:29.536 --> 10:34.002
These pilgrims were of the era before Germans had become once again thin and handsome.

10:34.663 --> 10:40.872
Many were florid and overweight, too vocally dressed and perspiring freely, yet they seemed happy.

10:40.892 --> 10:43.135
Most of the men looked plain and decent.

10:43.155 --> 10:45.378
They wore fidelity pins and carried missiles.

10:45.758 --> 10:48.282
Some of the women had sweet, angelic faces.

10:48.302 --> 10:54.290
If they were six feet, Lucas calculated, born in 1932, 13 at the end of the war.

10:55.011 --> 10:59.357
He had picked up the habit of calculating Germans' ages from the Israelis.

11:09.040 --> 11:25.260
It really depended on whether you were driving or walking.

11:27.299 --> 11:33.909
Well, it was not without a certain broadness, but I don't think it was really dangerous.

11:33.949 --> 11:38.757
The Gaza Strip turned out to be more dangerous than me in Canada.

11:38.777 --> 11:48.371
We got caught in the Gaza Strip in July, and any party who didn't look like this belonged to the Gaza Strip or wasn't in a U.N.

11:49.974 --> 11:51.877
car or went too far from the U.N.

11:51.897 --> 11:54.100
car was assumed

11:54.603 --> 11:57.289
It could be an Israeli.

11:57.931 --> 12:02.020
It was an out-of-control situation with a riot.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.368
That was a difficult day we had.

12:05.508 --> 12:08.114
It was the fifth anniversary of the Antifada.

12:08.134 --> 12:11.582
We never been over there, but we were.

12:11.562 --> 12:22.235
And some of the time we were in a little white UN car, but there were times we weren't, he had some trouble.

12:22.256 --> 12:33.590
But the most part, I didn't really feel it was dangerous, and I don't think most people go around with a sense of pain.

12:33.610 --> 12:39.257
There are plenty of Israelis who continue to go to their favorite restaurant.

12:39.811 --> 12:42.234
in the old city.

12:42.254 --> 12:43.636
I mean, there are many.

12:43.716 --> 12:45.018
I don't know if there's a point.

12:45.038 --> 12:49.144
Israelis, we can say out of the non-Jewish sections of the old city.

12:49.164 --> 12:50.626
But there are many who will go there.

12:51.527 --> 12:59.778
I mean, they just, you know, I think that's wholeheartedly what many Israelis are like.

12:59.798 --> 13:05.886
I mean, they like the falafel over there.

13:05.866 --> 13:13.781
And a lot of people are making a statement about .

13:13.802 --> 13:22.238
And some people prefer to go on, and some people prefer to go on often, because it's really very funny.

13:24.175 --> 13:28.103
The last time was a couple of years ago.

13:28.143 --> 13:31.790
Since 1992, I guess it must have been before.

13:32.812 --> 13:37.240
Everything seems like two years ago.

13:37.658 --> 13:46.112
Since, once, once, since, since 1992.

13:46.132 --> 13:52.543
You said people go off, you said you were packing, then you were dead, you know, they were dead.

13:52.623 --> 14:02.199
No, usually they're, usually they're, they're, they're, they're, they're carrying either a busy or, or, you know, that's what I need.

14:02.219 --> 14:02.299
Huh?

14:02.279 --> 14:28.692
People who have business with him and so forth are usually

14:29.566 --> 14:52.941
carrying off very visible arms when they when they go over there um it's uh if that that accuses it going on already it really depends on what kind of space you do

14:52.921 --> 15:01.530
I mean, there is a human rights organization, which I know, unfortunately, is called the Te Shalom.

15:01.550 --> 15:12.482
The Te Shalom workers go into East Jerusalem, not only into the Old City, but into the Middle of the East City.

15:12.842 --> 15:17.207
They're recognizable to the Palestinians as Israelis.

15:17.187 --> 15:20.031
But they're often known as workers when they show off.

15:20.431 --> 15:23.876
They would never dream of going in their arms.

15:23.896 --> 15:29.344
And so they go right into the Gaza Strip and go right back.

15:29.584 --> 15:36.053
And I mean, often they've got to go with a little bit of Palestinian.

15:36.073 --> 15:37.775
They're making mistakes.

15:37.795 --> 15:38.436
They're not coming at all.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.923
You said the novel was driven by a sense of place.

15:51.643 --> 15:55.868
Did you create the characters to conform with this sense of place?

15:58.310 --> 15:59.031
Well, yes.

15:59.211 --> 16:05.097
The characters are the people who would be there.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.399
They have characters who would be there.

16:07.419 --> 16:12.144
There's sort of a compromise between the place and me.

16:12.164 --> 16:18.210
The people who would be there, who I would write without attention.

16:18.697 --> 16:48.130
Well, Damascus Gate is also the gate that leads to the road where, you know, his divine

16:48.582 --> 17:14.353
striking down so it's what it suggests as reversals and conversions and and conspicuity and synchronicity and heresy and all sorts of things given all the religious and political contention that focus is there you expect your book to

17:14.536 --> 17:19.500
with any of these groups in any particular way?

17:19.520 --> 17:24.825
Well, I was very naive if I expected it to not go out of any waters.

17:26.406 --> 17:32.672
I can only rely on its, you know, on what I believe to be its honesty.

17:32.692 --> 17:39.518
And it's, you know, it's... I mean, in a way, I don't know whether it's the responsibility of a novel to be fair.

17:39.538 --> 17:41.419
Perhaps not.

17:41.439 --> 17:44.442
But, you know, I think that...

17:44.928 --> 17:56.048
In this case, this may end up, because of the moral imperative involved, in having been as fair as I can think of.

17:56.068 --> 18:01.958
So, as I say, I would be naive if I was thinking of royalty in the water.

18:02.596 --> 18:10.701
I am finally the person who has to live with what I have written.

18:12.566 --> 18:15.475
And I am finally...

18:16.197 --> 18:26.690
the repository of my own conscience, and I guess, ultimately, the judge of what I've written in terms of expanding.

18:26.710 --> 18:34.180
So I, you know, I am, I feel strong in the Lord, as they say, in religious quarters.

18:34.200 --> 18:45.394
And, you know, I think I've been royal in some orders, but I think I've been fair, and I think I've been accurate, and I think I've reflected the situation.

18:45.374 --> 18:56.609
I don't know if I can carry the weight, but I hope so.

18:56.629 --> 18:56.909
I ought to be.

18:56.929 --> 18:57.149
I ought to.

18:57.169 --> 19:14.452
Because I don't think I've done anything that anyone could do.

19:14.472 --> 19:14.672
Thank you.

19:14.888 --> 19:24.182
Do you feel more in touch with your Catholic-ness, Catholic-ness, and the writing of it?

19:24.282 --> 19:25.083
I don't know.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.567
I don't think so.

19:28.348 --> 19:28.648
Maybe.

19:28.768 --> 19:33.355
I don't know the answer to that.

19:33.515 --> 19:40.185
I don't know whether I feel more in touch with it.

19:40.205 --> 19:42.128
I mean, obviously, weddings...

19:42.108 --> 19:49.238
But I feel more in touch as a result.

19:50.359 --> 19:52.462
I don't know.

19:52.623 --> 19:58.731
I really got quite dazzled by Kabbalah.

19:58.791 --> 20:00.834
I suppose so.

20:01.034 --> 20:01.975
I suppose so.

20:02.236 --> 20:07.423
I suppose so.

20:07.403 --> 20:23.583
Are there people there?

20:24.043 --> 20:28.409
Yeah, I spent a lot of time on that.

20:28.529 --> 20:34.356
A lot of, a lot of Israeli writers.

20:34.336 --> 20:36.599
.

20:36.619 --> 20:51.660
.

20:51.680 --> 20:56.207
.

20:56.227 --> 20:56.247
.

20:56.267 --> 20:56.287
.

20:56.307 --> 20:56.327
.

20:56.307 --> 21:13.185
... ... ... ...
