WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:09.242
Dr. Richard Landon.

00:10.163 --> 00:11.124
I'm sorry.

00:11.144 --> 00:14.268
Are you writing a paper, a book, a monograph?

00:14.288 --> 00:22.177
No, I hope it'll be actually something very old-fashioned, a biobibliography, but I don't know how that'll work out.

00:22.698 --> 00:31.388
It probably will be a bibliography with a long biographical introduction, because nothing's been done on him since 1900.

00:32.009 --> 00:42.018
His friend, Edward Claude, wrote a memoir in 1900, and that's all there is.

00:42.639 --> 00:46.782
So he's yet another one of those totally neglected people.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.124
Grant Hill is the name.

00:48.324 --> 00:49.245
Grant Allen.

00:49.625 --> 00:50.206
Grant Allen.

00:50.406 --> 00:52.808
Grant Hill must be a racing car driver, I think.

00:52.828 --> 00:53.428
Probably.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.570
Possibly.

00:55.630 --> 01:00.615
Do you have the same kinds of concerns up here?

01:00.933 --> 01:04.478
with literary canons that seem to be sweeping.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.542
I just did an interview with Robert Fegel's last week.

01:07.562 --> 01:08.403
They're very interesting.

01:08.503 --> 01:19.237
Of course, we had this great renaissance of interest in the classics, at a time when people say they're not relevant anymore, and of course, all of a sudden, the Odyssey is a bestseller.

01:19.597 --> 01:26.146
I think what's happened, actually, well, in academia, at least, in the last few years, cheers.

01:26.166 --> 01:26.787
That's right.

01:26.807 --> 01:30.231
The...

01:30.768 --> 01:53.822
Postmodern literary criticism has become kind of outrÃ©, and Toronto wasn't one of the places that got really destroyed, where some did, where there were splits right down the middle, and English departments particularly fighting with each other over Derrida and Bakhtin and so on.

01:55.224 --> 01:59.070
That didn't really happen here, partly because the departments were big,

01:59.624 --> 02:02.254
that it could absorb a lot.

02:02.896 --> 02:11.288
But what seems to me to have happened, which is really interesting, is that the history of the book, in its widest sense,

02:11.842 --> 02:15.366
has kind of, it's the new sexy field.

02:16.508 --> 02:22.035
And Toronto actually... You mentioned you have a senator, but this is the Library of Congress Penn for their center.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.116
Oh, right.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.461
You push a button and you get a different thing with that.

02:26.481 --> 02:27.582
Oh, right.

02:27.602 --> 02:28.463
It's kind of cute.

02:28.483 --> 02:28.864
Yeah.

02:28.884 --> 02:33.870
But I mean, of course, I pointed out this is the topic now, isn't it, Jeff?

02:33.890 --> 02:34.150
Sure.

02:34.651 --> 02:39.317
Well, what's happened, I think, is that because...

02:39.871 --> 02:52.428
well, using Histoire de L'Eve and the work of all those French guys, there's developed such a wider interest.

02:52.448 --> 03:09.051
And so it's not just bibliography and the physical book and collecting, but the sociology of texts, reading, and all these things, to the point where the English department here made a tenured appointment

03:09.723 --> 03:12.106
a couple of years ago in the history of the book.

03:14.109 --> 03:18.736
I'm very interested in talking to some people.

03:18.776 --> 03:24.024
The person who has the position is Gillian Fenwick.

03:24.044 --> 03:25.926
How do you spell it?

03:25.947 --> 03:28.230
Gillian's G-I-L-L-I-A-N.

03:29.151 --> 03:33.598
Fenwick is F-E-N-W-I-C-K.

03:33.618 --> 03:34.359
F-E-N-W.

03:34.859 --> 03:36.101
It's like Fenwick, right?

03:36.121 --> 03:39.426
Yeah, but she's English, so it's Fenwick.

03:40.435 --> 03:44.799
But she told me last week, you know, when was it last week?

03:44.819 --> 03:49.644
Sometime in the not too distant past that she was going to Italy.

03:51.365 --> 03:56.070
She might, she would come, she would be there tonight if she's in town.

03:56.730 --> 04:01.615
I mean, a lot of the people that you probably want to meet will turn up tonight.

04:01.895 --> 04:02.336
Oh, sure.

04:02.396 --> 04:04.618
I'm going to make a public appeal then, if it's okay with you.

04:04.638 --> 04:07.400
We'll talk about this book that's in progress.

04:07.420 --> 04:09.222
Sure, yeah, sure.

04:09.262 --> 04:10.223
And reading that.

04:10.388 --> 04:15.293
this whole concept, reading this, as Anthony Grafton said at his talk, you were there.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.195
That was a great answer.

04:17.235 --> 04:19.857
That was wonderful, yeah.

04:19.978 --> 04:23.601
I said, we have to talk, even at Princeton when we go up to Harvard, you know.

04:24.542 --> 04:36.314
We're going to get him up here, I'm not sure when, Zach, because what we've done with the Center, our Center for the Book is not like L.C.'

04:36.294 --> 04:38.676
's, it's probably more typical.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.378
What it really is, is that

04:40.966 --> 04:46.653
About three or four years ago, five people got together and said, OK, we're going to have a center for the book.

04:46.673 --> 04:57.166
And there was someone from English, from French, from medieval studies, information studies, and me.

04:58.808 --> 04:59.248
History.

04:59.629 --> 05:01.571
We drug in someone from history.

05:02.011 --> 05:09.100
We left the word history deliberately out of the title because we didn't want to spend the first decade arguing about what history is.

05:09.248 --> 05:12.452
which has been a problem for some of them.

05:12.472 --> 05:25.127
And we invited Tom Tansel to come give the first one, found a little bit of money to bring him up, and now it's well established.

05:25.588 --> 05:27.911
We run a seminar each year.

05:27.951 --> 05:33.838
We just had it a few weeks ago at Massey College for graduate students where they give the papers

05:34.291 --> 05:39.940
and then we do a demonstration on the presses, and people get to print their own keepsakes and all that kind of stuff.

05:39.961 --> 05:40.361
That sounds great.

05:41.183 --> 05:47.553
Can you get some literature on this that you can send me or give me along here?

05:47.673 --> 05:59.353
This is really a major focus of what I'm hoping to write in a way that is consistent with the General Madness, accessible, good stories, but to really kind of enter these discussions.

05:59.654 --> 06:07.601
the canon debates, the books of the future, the libraries of the future, this whole trend towards virtual stuff.

06:07.781 --> 06:11.325
I'm going to London in two weeks, going to the new British Library.

06:11.565 --> 06:13.607
Do you have a contact over there?

06:13.687 --> 06:16.609
You could suggest I contact, by the way, the St.

06:16.629 --> 06:17.430
Pancras?

06:18.191 --> 06:23.896
Well, I know the Director General, but his name is now Bradbury.

06:23.916 --> 06:28.260
The guy you should get in touch with's name is Mike Crump.

06:29.135 --> 06:30.136
C-R-U-M-P.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.818
Can you have a phone number for me?

06:32.338 --> 06:33.699
I will get you one, yeah.

06:33.719 --> 06:35.181
Super.

06:35.301 --> 06:43.749
He's now... God, they change them every six weeks practically, you know, the whole structure and their names and everything.

06:43.789 --> 06:45.130
I think there's tons of stuff on the internet.

06:45.150 --> 06:52.798
He's the Director of Collections for the Humanities and Social Sciences or something like that.

06:53.138 --> 06:55.260
He's under the DG

06:56.607 --> 06:59.871
But I know a lot of people there, actually.

06:59.911 --> 07:10.422
Miriam Foote, you should probably... I talked to her for the first book, too, and I thanked her in the acknowledgement, so I should... I don't know if I've got a current phone number for her.

07:10.502 --> 07:11.203
She's still there.

07:11.223 --> 07:11.924
I have that.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.587
Now, of course, they're only... They haven't really moved yet.

07:15.248 --> 07:18.391
But I certainly want to go over there and just see what's happening.

07:18.451 --> 07:20.033
Well, you should get a tour.

07:20.485 --> 07:24.249
of the new place, because it's incredible.

07:24.369 --> 07:27.733
And that's really the purpose of his first trip in two weeks.

07:27.913 --> 07:28.674
It's incredible.

07:29.595 --> 07:34.521
How much of it's open and accessible now, I'm not sure.

07:34.581 --> 07:41.789
The last time I went through the whole, the rare book reading, it's in a tower.

07:42.029 --> 07:46.594
It's an incredible thing, because you'll see it through glass.

07:47.452 --> 07:53.139
Here in Canada, you know, we talk about the canon debate down in the U.S.

07:53.600 --> 08:04.674
You've got women, and you've got African Americans, and you've got traditionalists, and you've got Marxists, and you've got Afro-centricists.

08:04.694 --> 08:05.736
We have all that, too.

08:05.876 --> 08:14.387
But up here, it seems where you have a two-language... Do you have a different kind of a... Is there a different kind of a...

08:15.160 --> 08:16.522
perspective on it up here?

08:16.722 --> 08:21.810
Is it more dichotomized between French-speaking and English-speaking people?

08:22.291 --> 08:24.494
Yes and no, yeah.

08:24.515 --> 08:39.638
It is, and if you looked at, if you went to Quebec and talked to people there about the history of the book and about bibliography, you would find that their major influence is the French tradition.

08:39.678 --> 08:43.564
And because the French really don't believe in bibliography,

08:43.983 --> 08:48.910
All the great bibliographies of French authors are done by Brits and Americans.

08:50.172 --> 08:50.773
Why is that?

08:50.793 --> 08:53.577
Well, because... Does that make them a speakeasy as well?

08:53.597 --> 09:11.863
Well, it has to do with the... Well, it probably has to do with the philosophic movement in the 18th century and the development of critical theories that... But why would they be so... They're just not interested in bibliography in that traditional Anglo-American way.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.795
No, that's not entirely true.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.898
But they certainly have a deep sense of canon, though.

09:16.918 --> 09:18.080
Oh, yeah, very much so.

09:18.360 --> 09:18.761
Oh, yes.

09:19.221 --> 09:19.582
Oh, yes.

09:20.803 --> 09:35.944
See, that has not much to do, well, it does have to do with bibliography in that it has been traditionally thought, but this is the kind of graduate school syndrome, that if you don't work on a major author, you're not doing major work.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.555
But we've gotten away from that a lot, I think.

09:39.776 --> 09:45.542
Not everybody has to do their wretched dissertation on Yeats and Virginia Woolf anymore.

09:47.645 --> 09:56.515
The astounding thing is that the number of major British writers for which there is no bibliography.

09:57.376 --> 09:58.177
Could you name a few?

09:58.197 --> 09:59.979
Sure.

10:00.079 --> 10:06.066
I'm still the chairman of this fellowship committee, the thing I gave the report for,

10:06.704 --> 10:33.370
and um i'm interested in bibliography yeah okay okay we got a uh an application from a guy to do a bibliography of george eliot and i thought there's got to be a bibliography of george eliot there isn't give me a break nope you don't find it there are a couple of things that are this but there's no real bibliography the bibliography of pope is a mess

10:33.822 --> 10:37.847
needs, and maybe David Vander Mullen will do it, but it's formidable.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.449
Swift is terrible.

10:40.290 --> 10:44.315
Johnson is a 1916 bibliography.

10:44.355 --> 10:53.967
So Goldsmiths, the only thing there is is an unusable biobibliography by Temple Scott.

10:54.668 --> 11:00.015
The contrast is there are six bibliographies of Swinburne.

11:00.316 --> 11:02.219
Is he more major?

11:02.279 --> 11:03.301
No, no, no.

11:03.661 --> 11:05.844
It just happens that way somehow.

11:06.205 --> 11:08.488
Easier to do, I think, is one.

11:08.989 --> 11:11.613
You don't mind jumping around the block on questions and stuff.

11:11.633 --> 11:12.495
They come to my mind.

11:12.515 --> 11:18.023
But Fagels told me last week that he's at Princeton.

11:18.043 --> 11:22.530
You can get a degree in English literature from Princeton without being required to study Shakespeare.

11:24.493 --> 11:29.260
Amherst College, he is an alum of Amherst, and Scott Turrell told me this.

11:30.117 --> 11:45.673
he was at a table one night when the president of Amherst was informed that they had just, this was about three years ago, had just graduated as summa in English who had never taken a course in Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, Spencer.

11:45.733 --> 11:51.800
And I say, Jesus Christ, if you're getting a degree in literature, fine.

11:52.561 --> 11:59.668
That's cool, that's why, but to purport, to suggest that you are a summa cum laude

11:59.918 --> 12:08.245
graduate of a major American liberalized college in English literature, and you've never been required to demonstrate proficiency in Shakespeare.

12:08.826 --> 12:10.387
Something's wrong there, don't you think?

12:11.067 --> 12:12.809
Oh, sure, and this wouldn't happen here.

12:12.869 --> 12:16.372
Toronto's unusual in Boston.

12:16.392 --> 12:18.033
Harvard still requires it, thank goodness.

12:18.093 --> 12:23.838
Well, Toronto does too, because you can't, you've got to start off with those.

12:23.878 --> 12:29.503
You could, if you hate Shakespeare, you can shift yourself out of it, probably, but you've got to,

12:29.770 --> 12:30.892
read it once.

12:31.052 --> 12:34.857
It's like getting a PhD in the classics without being required to understand Greek.

12:34.918 --> 12:36.640
I mean, you can do that.

12:38.182 --> 12:40.065
You can probably do that, too.

12:41.147 --> 12:42.148
But no, I don't.

12:43.730 --> 12:50.681
The other unusual thing about Toronto is that it teaches bibliography in the English department.

12:51.602 --> 12:54.666
There's a guy... Very unusual, isn't it?

12:54.787 --> 12:58.372
It's required for... Not for undergraduate.

12:58.452 --> 12:58.512
No.

12:58.880 --> 13:04.648
although it should be, and there's some talk of trying to shift it in.

13:04.688 --> 13:09.975
Well, at least for the time you ought to take bibliography... I'm an English major, and I've never had a course in bibliography.

13:09.995 --> 13:12.278
You should take it in fourth year.

13:12.338 --> 13:27.739
Particularly, well, maybe not everybody, but if you're going to go on to graduate studies at all, that's when you should start doing it, because the way one teaches bibliography, and I teach it, is that...

13:28.141 --> 13:32.706
I haven't even thought about it yet.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.789
I will let you know, though.

13:35.809 --> 13:48.803
I'll let you know that at least part of it is how to do research, and that's when you should be learning it.

13:48.863 --> 13:54.108
What happens even here is that people who don't want to do the business, so you have to do BIP-1.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.870
BIP-1 is

13:56.221 --> 14:25.840
if you're an ma or phd student uh big one is is pretty general and it's taught by different people but uh a lot of it's fairly basic stuff i mean it has physical analytical and descriptive bibliography as part of it but a lot of it's really just how to use research resources in the humanities uh big two is for doctoral students

14:26.123 --> 14:36.622
And it's divided chronologically, so there's a medieval one, a Renaissance one, sort of 17th and 18th century, 19th century, and modern.

14:37.303 --> 14:46.360
And they're not all offered every year, but you have to have taken it before you finish.

14:46.913 --> 14:59.865
What that means is that if you get a doctorate from Toronto, you've seen a hand press actually operating.

15:00.365 --> 15:01.847
You've had to do collations.

15:02.547 --> 15:05.690
You've had to do a little bit of textual criticism.

15:05.730 --> 15:15.199
Even if you never do it again, at least one hopes that it sticks.

15:15.770 --> 15:31.551
But there was a guy who came up from Chicago, and Chicago is a decent place, to do a doctorate in medieval studies, and he actually ended up being the printing assistant at

15:31.885 --> 15:33.187
Marie gets a TA.

15:33.207 --> 15:34.770
Oh, shit, I was going to come around.

15:35.311 --> 15:37.675
Oh, your wife is crazy.

15:37.695 --> 15:38.857
Yeah.

15:39.558 --> 15:40.920
What time is it?

15:41.061 --> 15:42.383
It's 10 minutes in the morning.

15:42.463 --> 15:43.224
Do I give her a ring?

15:43.244 --> 15:44.447
I'll give her a ring.

15:44.467 --> 15:48.393
Actually, I meant to ask you, would you be in touch with anyone there?

15:48.433 --> 15:48.814
Yeah.

15:48.794 --> 16:17.788
uh who um father derek is away at oxford and there's a fellow over there by the name of farge farge i know jim farge is fine and he's and i said i'd come by and whenever i come by so and he's there okay that's good i just yeah and i can do that on my own but you have to keep track of these guys uh because they do better off like me all right i'm i'm cool but that that i can do on my own too by the way so i'm gonna point you in the right

16:17.903 --> 16:25.431
It's all pretty compact.

16:25.451 --> 16:30.657
Probably the best idea is to sort of end up in the later afternoon at Fisher.

16:31.118 --> 16:36.063
I can show you, then you've got to change.

16:37.925 --> 16:40.868
Never had a bibliography course.

16:41.269 --> 16:46.915
He'd done a BA and MA at Chicago in the English department.

16:47.114 --> 16:48.737
They didn't teach it at all.

16:48.797 --> 16:55.749
Now, that surprised me a lot with the kind of tradition that Chicago had.

16:55.830 --> 17:05.547
I'm a guy who wrote a book about books, who loves books, who's been writing journalism about books for over 20 years and working on a new book about books.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.953
Explain for me so I can explain for a general reader.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.492
to the importance of bibliography.

17:12.013 --> 17:14.316
Why is bibliography relevant today?

17:14.597 --> 17:22.831
I have a sense of what it is, but you teach it, you know it, you understand it, you work with it on a daily basis.

17:23.792 --> 17:29.422
This new book is going to have something to say about books and book culture on the eve of a new millennium.

17:29.442 --> 17:35.953
I'm just wondering if you might let your imagination soar on that question.

17:36.288 --> 17:40.975
Well, I guess what it is... What didn't this guy know about bibliography, for instance?

17:41.095 --> 17:41.956
What surprised him?

17:41.976 --> 17:42.597
What didn't he know?

17:42.878 --> 17:44.901
I mean, do I know about bibliography?

17:44.921 --> 17:45.522
I think I do.

17:45.802 --> 17:48.026
I'm a collector.

17:48.046 --> 17:49.327
I do research.

17:49.628 --> 17:50.930
I'm wondering, what is it?

17:50.950 --> 18:02.447
Well, I mean, the easy test is, could you write a collation for a 15th century book, a 16th century book, a 17th century book?

18:03.052 --> 18:11.444
a French 18th century book and an English 18th century book.

18:12.085 --> 18:16.592
Explain for my readers what a collation is.

18:16.612 --> 18:24.183
Well, it's the physical, how the book was physically constructed.

18:24.684 --> 18:32.535
So it's the context, I think, and it's not an end.

18:33.038 --> 18:47.841
It's just a means to understanding not only the book in some kind of abstract sense, but the book in its absolute physical sense of what a codex is.

18:48.175 --> 19:09.373
there are sheets of paper they're folded in a particular way they have the ink impressed into them in a particular way and that you can understand the only way you can understand the physical structure is through bibliographical analysis now there's it can be quite simple that

19:09.826 --> 19:15.793
You know, this is an octavo, a crown octavo that has eight leaves and 16 pages.

19:15.833 --> 19:19.397
People tend to think an octavo is of a certain size, which is not really the case.

19:19.437 --> 19:22.821
It's the sheets and how they fold it, I think, isn't it?

19:22.841 --> 19:24.303
That defines it.

19:24.323 --> 19:24.843
Yeah, sure.

19:25.024 --> 19:32.492
Except that the sizes of paper, when it was made by hand, were... Pretty standard.

19:32.552 --> 19:37.538
Well, there was a limit, because it's the limit to how much the...

19:37.940 --> 19:59.712
batman can hold uh you know they could they would use double molds but it required a great big guy who was pretty strong to wield a double mold so so you've got standard sizes and they come in and in a rough sense uh modern books uh maintain that

20:01.379 --> 20:02.301
sizes.

20:02.341 --> 20:06.569
You know, your average novel is about the same size as a traditional octavo.

20:06.910 --> 20:11.579
Your average art book is about like a quarter.

20:11.619 --> 20:23.742
Your average fancy facsimile is often a folio, or some art books are too, but of course

20:23.924 --> 20:26.688
They're not any longer constructed that way.

20:26.748 --> 20:29.592
I mean, they have no format in a literal sense.

20:29.733 --> 20:33.478
It's just a bunch of single leaves that are glued together.

20:33.518 --> 20:36.463
Basically what we have are 16-page signatures.

20:36.683 --> 20:38.426
Yeah, that's right.

20:38.706 --> 20:39.187
Gathering.

20:40.849 --> 20:46.097
But that's... So the relevance is not to the general public.

20:46.217 --> 20:52.767
I mean, a collector would want to be able at least to collate their books to discover whether...

20:53.168 --> 21:15.987
they were complete and that sounds simple to people but in fact for older books of course it's not simple at all and of course if you collect books that are illustrated with plates and so on it's crucial to colleagues and so you you would normally want to know not for that

21:16.169 --> 21:29.469
If your only interest in books is extracting the information from the text, then you don't really need to know anything at all about bibliography.

21:29.589 --> 21:45.012
But somebody needs to know if you're doing research, because if you're actually doing serious research on, say, Jacobean drama, you have to have

21:45.262 --> 22:13.513
some confidence that what you're looking at is a layer has not been made up from three different editions uh etc etc um so that this kind of analysis just provides that how many volumes at your university well somewhere around 10 million

22:13.696 --> 22:18.401
It wasâwe had the eight millionth volume a couple of years ago.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.743
So you're clearly the largest collection in Canada.

22:20.763 --> 22:21.183
Oh, yes.

22:21.684 --> 22:22.645
By a long way.

22:23.886 --> 22:25.588
You're the Harvard of Canada, right?

22:25.908 --> 22:37.419
Well, they talk about the Harvard of the North, which is all nonsense, of course, and no other places like Harvard, and particularly what Toronto's like.

22:37.740 --> 22:40.302
I couldn't have done a Journal of Madness without living close to Harvard.

22:40.422 --> 22:41.023
Oh, sure.

22:41.383 --> 22:43.045
That was the same job.

22:43.396 --> 22:51.847
But, I mean, what Toronto's like in the most general sense are the major land-grant institutions.

22:51.967 --> 22:58.556
We're like Berkeley, we're like UCLA, we're like Michigan, we're like Indiana, we're like Texas to some extent.

22:59.738 --> 23:00.939
So you get some public support.

23:01.620 --> 23:02.121
It's all.

23:03.102 --> 23:04.003
Well, not all.

23:04.164 --> 23:10.872
I mean, they're now trying to raise the balance and so on in a fairly active way, but that's not traditional in Canada.

23:11.253 --> 23:12.795
I can only think of one...

23:13.602 --> 23:23.337
endowed the institution of higher education of any significance in the whole country, bishops, which you've probably never heard of.

23:23.417 --> 23:24.378
That's new to me.

23:24.659 --> 23:27.223
Yeah, it's in the eastern townships.

23:28.004 --> 23:31.669
It's near Sherbrooke.

23:32.611 --> 23:33.612
No, they're all public.

23:34.253 --> 23:39.441
But does this basically represent more or less the quasi-efficient

23:39.708 --> 23:42.652
Book Repository of Canada then?

23:42.712 --> 23:43.493
Yeah, sure.

23:43.773 --> 23:47.858
The National Library was not founded until 1952.

23:48.158 --> 23:50.962
A little late to the game.

23:51.002 --> 23:54.927
A little late to the game, and so it's only had copyright deposits since then.

23:55.508 --> 23:59.032
So its sole mandate is Canadiana.

23:59.052 --> 24:01.315
It does not collect in any other field.

24:01.335 --> 24:03.257
So you basically carry the ball.

24:04.459 --> 24:05.580
That's right.

24:06.505 --> 24:08.569
I was up at Cornell a couple of months ago.

24:09.712 --> 24:11.235
And very interesting.

24:11.395 --> 24:16.846
You know, they're really at the cutting edge, the forefront of this whole digital stuff.

24:16.866 --> 24:18.950
We've done some stuff with them, actually.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.053
Point for conversation.

24:20.433 --> 24:22.417
Well, it can hit the public consciousness.

24:22.498 --> 24:25.223
That guy, Baker...

24:25.675 --> 24:28.759
Oh, Baker being who we talked about.

24:28.779 --> 24:30.602
Nicholas, is that the New Yorker?

24:30.622 --> 24:31.984
Or Nicholson Baker.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.406
I'm interviewing him for my book, yeah.

24:33.426 --> 24:39.175
So, he can get the San Francisco Public Library's woes into the New Yorker.

24:39.215 --> 24:41.077
I got a better story than his.

24:41.097 --> 24:43.521
Mike Cornell's story is much better than his.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.647
But, you know, the thing is... That's why I don't want to say too much about it.

24:47.727 --> 24:49.149
That's a hell of a story.

24:49.249 --> 24:52.334
They're not actually sending much left to the dumps without telling anybody.

24:53.495 --> 24:55.378
And... See you in San Francisco.

24:56.371 --> 25:03.160
We have been joined by Richard's wife, Marie.

25:04.201 --> 25:04.902
This is interesting.

25:04.942 --> 25:07.626
You're a book couple, right?

25:08.146 --> 25:08.627
Yeah.

25:08.647 --> 25:14.695
Maybe you could just, if you don't mind my jumping around, maybe Marie could just tell me from my take-in-home what you're doing now.

25:14.775 --> 25:16.517
I know of your Philadelphia background.

25:16.758 --> 25:22.345
I'm working as a librarian at Massey College, which has a special collection in the history of printing.

25:22.831 --> 25:30.301
And it includes not only books about the history of printing, but a collection of 19th century iron hand presses that come under my jurisdiction.

25:30.321 --> 25:31.727
They're all in working order.

25:31.825 --> 25:33.327
The presses are.

25:33.347 --> 25:34.708
The presses are in working order.

25:34.728 --> 25:36.209
Oh, I can see this while I'm here, right?

25:36.350 --> 25:36.850
Yep.

25:37.711 --> 25:38.452
This afternoon.

25:38.612 --> 25:39.092
If you'd like.

25:39.152 --> 25:40.714
Yeah, book arts, all this stuff.

25:40.734 --> 25:41.475
All this stuff.

25:41.555 --> 25:42.936
Very interested in this.

25:42.956 --> 25:46.920
And also, there's a major collection of examples of book production.

25:46.940 --> 25:54.388
We have the collection that was put together by Rory McLean when he was working on his books on Victorian book design and publisher's findings.

25:54.948 --> 25:58.212
And we've added extensively to that as well.

25:58.232 --> 26:00.394
Rory McLean.

26:00.754 --> 26:01.495
M-C-L-E-A-N.

26:02.116 --> 26:04.800
Rory is R-U-A-R-I.

26:06.142 --> 26:06.863
Do it again?

26:06.883 --> 26:08.505
R-U-A-R-I.

26:08.525 --> 26:08.826
R-U-A-R-I.

26:09.046 --> 26:11.730
If you're Scottish, you'd probably say Rory.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.634
Okay.

26:14.955 --> 26:15.836
He lives on Mallet.

26:18.901 --> 26:18.961
Ah.

26:18.981 --> 26:19.321
I'm sorry.

26:19.782 --> 26:23.648
So, I have this sort of mini special collection.

26:23.928 --> 26:29.997
It's not nearly as large as what Richard has to deal with, but it's a great choice in what we have.

26:30.263 --> 26:57.655
Well, we were just talking about, I don't know how I'm going to integrate it, how it will, it'll just come together, but I really am interested in this whole concept of books, book culture, libraries, as we enter, you know, but to do it in the field kind of, I'm not just in Burkitts, I can't write at home, out of my imagination, I have to go out and report things that I find.

26:58.327 --> 27:11.664
We were talking about Cornell, which I visited, and how they are now number one under, apparently, by a mandate from their trustees to reduce the holdings from 6.8 million to 6 million by the year 2000.

27:11.684 --> 27:13.887
Well, that's right.

27:13.907 --> 27:15.529
It's my big space.

27:15.669 --> 27:16.570
You're going to have another?

27:16.671 --> 27:17.892
You're going to have another?

27:17.912 --> 27:17.992
Yep.

27:18.092 --> 27:18.413
I'll have one.

27:18.433 --> 27:22.338
I'll take a nap before I can talk.

27:23.679 --> 27:26.443
And Richard was saying you have 10 PS, 10 million

27:26.778 --> 27:30.443
The university has 10 million books.

27:30.483 --> 27:33.327
What's the attitude of the university towards the printed book?

27:33.347 --> 27:40.456
Oh, the attitude is that, you know, if it takes it, we'll have 20 million.

27:40.516 --> 27:51.250
At least when we digitize things, unlike Cornell, apparently we don't throw them out.

27:51.483 --> 27:57.413
No, they've only, so far as I can determine, they've only disposed of about 3,500 books.

27:58.214 --> 28:03.342
But they've disposed of 3,500 books, and they've been disposed of to be done.

28:03.503 --> 28:07.950
They strip them, and they fillet them, and they scan them, and then they dispose of them.

28:07.970 --> 28:08.471
And that's it.

28:08.491 --> 28:09.172
Now, L.C.

28:09.192 --> 28:09.933
does that, too.

28:10.334 --> 28:11.255
I understand.

28:11.435 --> 28:12.497
And have for years.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.946
We don't do that, although...

28:18.230 --> 28:22.157
I, you know, you do get a kind of love diminishing returns.

28:22.177 --> 28:25.863
I mean, you get to the point where... You guys will?

28:25.883 --> 28:27.065
Oh, no, yeah.

28:27.085 --> 28:29.309
But we should turn our attention to it probably.

28:30.110 --> 28:35.540
I mean, some of these books are really clapped out.

28:35.580 --> 28:39.747
Well, I understand.

28:39.807 --> 28:41.470
I'm not being judgmental here.

28:42.530 --> 28:46.015
depositing a situation that I've encountered quite by mistake.

28:46.075 --> 28:56.029
I mean, I went up there to find out about what they did in Cambodia to help, you know, all the Cambodias archives and records were destroyed, but guess what?

28:56.089 --> 29:02.698
There were copies at Cornell, so they were able to

29:03.269 --> 29:05.973
more or less received in the heads of a very interesting story.

29:06.093 --> 29:07.576
Oh, yeah.

29:07.756 --> 29:08.477
Oh, sure, yeah.

29:08.778 --> 29:19.314
No, it's certainly true that, you know, you cannot collect forever in a physical sense.

29:20.256 --> 29:23.501
Everyone can't collect everything forever.

29:24.222 --> 29:29.310
So that, I mean, what?

29:30.151 --> 29:36.875
You see, this has to balance against, it seems to me, the way people do research.

29:37.317 --> 29:41.612
We've gone to, I don't know how many conferences in the last few years on,

29:41.896 --> 30:06.874
uh wither the book and uh the new millennium and all this stuff i'm going on visiting all these places right the mit media lab on one day i'm going to see barton gregorian saturday yeah well claire lc you know stanford in the corbus interview okay one thing come together okay one thing you should ask them then is that at least in the humanities

30:07.192 --> 30:12.938
And that's what we're really dealing with social sciences to a small extent.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.341
I'm content to see the OED go online, for instance.

30:15.361 --> 30:17.503
Absolutely, yeah, sure, absolutely.

30:17.903 --> 30:26.472
But you should ask these guys, the ones that do research, what it is they most, what they want.

30:27.293 --> 30:32.559
And the answer that we've got, at least pretty consistently, is they want more.

30:32.959 --> 30:35.562
They don't think special collections are doing enough.

30:35.997 --> 30:37.080
He wants more now.

30:37.100 --> 30:42.412
The scholars, the people who actually do the research, want more what?

30:42.512 --> 30:44.136
More manuscripts, more books.

30:45.018 --> 30:54.360
They want, well, we had a guy actually tell us about, he works on the Spanish Civil War, a guy at Illinois.

30:54.340 --> 31:03.755
And he owns, he has a private collection as well, but he's been quite influential with shaping the collections at the university.

31:04.676 --> 31:10.886
And he's in the English department, I think, who's in history.

31:10.986 --> 31:22.203
Anyway, he's got... Well, Richard, before we forget, we'll get to it, but are you actively collecting special collections as we speak?

31:22.223 --> 31:22.744
Oh, yeah.

31:22.927 --> 31:26.531
You know, Cornell, and I'm not lacking Cornell, but I did get a sense there.

31:27.231 --> 31:29.794
They're not collecting anything, Special Collections.

31:29.854 --> 31:39.704
I mean, the only thing they've really added in the last 10 years is something that was given to them, which became a gay lesbian, which is a fine... There's a lot of money, which set the thing up.

31:39.724 --> 31:40.985
There's a reason for that.

31:41.085 --> 31:43.207
They had a Special Collections at Cornell.

31:43.287 --> 31:43.788
Is Mark?

31:43.808 --> 31:46.490
Is that I have the greatest... No, no, no, no, he's not.

31:46.931 --> 31:48.532
Oh, Atkinson.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.195
No, no, it's Tom...

31:51.277 --> 31:51.918
What's his name?

31:51.938 --> 31:52.379
Hickerson.

31:52.599 --> 31:53.440
Hickerson.

31:53.521 --> 31:54.522
He's the archivist.

31:55.103 --> 31:59.150
He's also in charge of the group of digital programs.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.712
You talk about conflict.

32:00.732 --> 32:01.534
It's not a conflict.

32:02.695 --> 32:03.937
No, but it is.

32:03.997 --> 32:09.927
No, but Dimunition, who's a nice guy and everything, is not head of Special Collections.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.421
He's not acquiring a thing.

32:12.562 --> 32:13.703
I spent two days there.

32:13.923 --> 32:18.987
Well, that sure changed, because when Don Eddy was there, they were all over the place.

32:19.287 --> 32:31.078
I mean, Don Eddy was the guy who proposed many, many, many years ago that, for ESTC, this is one of the 18th century short-term fellows.

32:31.198 --> 32:32.979
We better order, yeah.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.420
Yep, yep, yep.

32:34.440 --> 32:37.863
Can you turn that off for a second?

32:37.883 --> 32:38.684
We're doing okay.

32:38.964 --> 32:39.745
But, uh,

32:41.615 --> 32:53.352
No, but when ESTC, the 18th Century Short Title Catalog, was first given, no, this is just, well, it now is 1473 to 1800.

32:53.392 --> 32:56.456
So it's up to 1800 now.

32:56.476 --> 33:01.463
Oh, yeah, but this was the 18th Century, so it was 1701 to 1800.

33:02.405 --> 33:04.627
That's not ESTC, then, isn't it?

33:04.747 --> 33:07.010
No, no, this is ESTC.

33:07.510 --> 33:08.831
I missed the E, I'm sorry.

33:08.851 --> 33:09.092
Yeah, yeah.

33:09.492 --> 33:19.682
When that was first getting going, and it's been 20 years now, that's one of the great, that's actually something you ought to write about, one of the great international projects.

33:20.063 --> 33:22.105
Well, just let me write it down on this tape.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.907
Just put ESTC.

33:25.408 --> 33:30.353
But when it was first started, Don Eddy, who was then at Cornell,

33:30.873 --> 33:35.824
and head of special collections and taught in the English department as well.

33:36.285 --> 33:39.451
He proposed that different institutions take a decade.

33:40.894 --> 33:41.516
That's great.

33:41.536 --> 33:49.573
And he took the 1750s, and for years and years and years until Don Eddy was

33:49.925 --> 33:55.090
It's perfect for being obtuse, but take a decade and do what with it?

33:55.110 --> 33:57.252
Buy every English book in that decade.

33:57.272 --> 34:02.437
So you're not having to worry about the business of duplication or the question of duplication.

34:02.477 --> 34:07.622
Everybody's buying... No, but nobody else agreed to it.

34:08.503 --> 34:10.004
But Don kept doing it.

34:10.545 --> 34:15.970
He was buying as long as, well, until, what, three years ago?

34:15.990 --> 34:18.312
No, more than five years ago, maybe.

34:18.713 --> 34:22.057
they were still filling in the 1750s.

34:22.818 --> 34:25.601
Now, that meant that... And this is where once again?

34:25.982 --> 34:26.743
At Cornell.

34:26.763 --> 34:27.223
At Cornell.

34:27.784 --> 34:28.304
Wow.

34:28.324 --> 34:28.945
Don Eddy.

34:29.246 --> 34:34.472
You should talk to him sometime.

34:35.593 --> 34:44.704
And that meant, though, that they had to buy the first edition of Grey's Elegy, 1751, and all subsequent editions.

34:45.022 --> 34:46.904
as well as all those sermons.

34:46.984 --> 34:52.249
So on the one hand, you're getting sermons for when he started doing it, probably 10 bucks a pop.

34:52.950 --> 34:53.351
Or less.

34:53.551 --> 34:54.111
Or less.

34:55.052 --> 34:59.497
But the first edition of Grey's Elegy, they had a deep peak.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.378
So you get these.

35:01.339 --> 35:05.363
They had to have the first edition of Johnson's Dictionary, 7055.

35:06.304 --> 35:06.844
That's great.

35:06.864 --> 35:09.087
That's a good story.

35:09.267 --> 35:10.348
Is this guy around?

35:10.368 --> 35:10.808
Yeah.

35:10.828 --> 35:11.789
He's still at Cornell.

35:12.170 --> 35:12.430
Yeah.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.682
What is he doing?

35:13.742 --> 35:14.883
He's retired, I think.

35:14.903 --> 35:16.806
He's retired now, I think.

35:16.866 --> 35:17.928
What was his position then?

35:17.948 --> 35:19.490
He was a professor of English.

35:19.771 --> 35:21.053
And had a special collection.

35:21.073 --> 35:24.157
So he was basically replaced by Mark, no?

35:24.418 --> 35:31.929
Well, he was replaced by a combination of Mark and... Special collections are very low on the... Okay.

35:32.169 --> 35:36.155
I'll have the roast beef juice.

35:36.175 --> 35:39.160
What's up?

35:39.180 --> 35:40.662
You're doing very well here.

35:41.755 --> 35:48.001
Part of it is the change that has occurred in the way administratively... Part of what now?

35:48.021 --> 35:48.442
Part of what?

35:48.462 --> 35:53.247
Well, the transition from someone like Don Eddy to the current structure of Cornell.

35:53.487 --> 35:55.369
And Cornell's not the only place like this.

35:55.389 --> 35:56.830
Of course not.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.272
It's a very dramatic example of that.

35:58.332 --> 36:03.277
What's happened is that there's been layers of administration added in there.

36:04.038 --> 36:10.024
Often the person who is head of that department, or whatever you call it,

36:10.257 --> 36:17.169
is there as an administrator and is not the hands-on person who does any of the book buying or collecting.

36:17.189 --> 36:18.271
You're not doing the collection.

36:19.674 --> 36:20.736
Don did all of it.

36:20.836 --> 36:28.430
Well, there were other... Yeah, French was done by... Charles McNamara was there at one time.

36:28.850 --> 36:30.814
When you're talking about buying, you're talking about buying...

36:31.283 --> 36:36.972
special collections or are you just talking about filling in things that students will need?

36:37.833 --> 36:41.158
Well, no, you're talking about building special collections.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.041
Generally not.

36:43.301 --> 36:48.649
Usually the buying of current material is done somewhere else.

36:49.150 --> 36:51.013
I imagine that's true at Cornell.

36:51.652 --> 37:00.770
You know, there'll be a division between, but basically it's building a special collection.

37:01.130 --> 37:05.138
See, this doesn't... There's no harm in digitizing.

37:05.236 --> 37:12.264
There is no harm in digitizing a text, but you can't assume, and we don't know enough about digitizing technology.

37:12.644 --> 37:15.227
It's like when they, you know, in the 1950s when they started microfilming.

37:15.267 --> 37:19.392
My first question for Negroponte Wendy, by the way, tell me something about the technology.

37:19.692 --> 37:24.498
We know paper lasts for 500 years, if properly taken care of, right?

37:24.998 --> 37:29.083
We know when microfilming was done in the 40s and 50s,

37:29.367 --> 37:39.762
and books were thrown away, and then those films turned out to be defective later on, that whole years of newspapers were gone forever.

37:39.922 --> 37:42.366
Gene Ashton told me a story at Columbia.

37:43.187 --> 37:48.815
The New York Times, for a while, actually did an edition of the Daily New York Times on rag paper.

37:49.897 --> 37:52.981
But it's so difficult to handle, nobody uses it.

37:53.101 --> 37:57.227
Okay, but you want the other New York Times story.

37:57.247 --> 37:59.290
The New York Times microfilm

37:59.540 --> 38:11.727
The first set that was bought at Toronto turned out that, you know, they don't get used every day and somebody went to use one and the whole thing was stuck together.

38:12.095 --> 38:14.359
Some kind of gooey mess.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.786
The New York Times replaced the whole set.

38:18.688 --> 38:21.092
But the film was defective.

38:21.152 --> 38:23.276
It wasn't a stable film.

38:23.296 --> 38:27.244
Yeah, but there are instances, I mean, at least they had a master that they could replace it from.

38:27.264 --> 38:31.572
There have been instances where text has been lost.

38:31.754 --> 38:34.477
because the film deteriorated.

38:34.517 --> 38:41.926
Well, newspapers are generally... I'd love an example of something really important that was lies.

38:42.306 --> 38:44.829
That's the kind of... I love detail on that.

38:46.651 --> 38:56.843
Well, I mean, I'm sure this comes up at some... Yeah, this would probably more the people who were in preservation would know those kinds of... I'm going to tell you a story.

38:57.003 --> 39:00.647
I mean, destroying the original, whether...

39:01.133 --> 39:03.936
We're talking about something in manuscript here.

39:04.077 --> 39:05.498
Especially if it's manuscript.

39:05.578 --> 39:17.112
But destroying the original, even if it's a printed book, you're destroying a lot of artifactual evidence that is important to scholars down the road that we may never know about in our times.

39:18.214 --> 39:25.002
People are now, already, people are looking not merely at a text, but merely looking at the way in which that text has been presented to them.

39:25.683 --> 39:27.445
And to destroy a manuscript,

39:28.100 --> 39:56.200
intentionally exploring the story to yourself okay that's crazy because there's a college president i told this to he wanted to call his car analysis on they'll put a stop there i said hey hey no let them do what they're doing please i'm telling you the story as a colleague yeah and he said but i said whatever it's no big deal i said it'll be a bigger deal when i write about it trust me i said there'll be a greater good when i write it when it comes to this one when i write about it because

39:56.450 --> 40:18.930
That seems nuts to me because all you have to do is think about what do you really want to see from the Middle Ages?

40:20.024 --> 40:21.446
from the medieval period.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.652
What you don't need to see any more of are books of ours.

40:25.993 --> 40:37.329
We've seen hundreds and thousands of them, formal stuff that copied by, I mean, they're beautiful, painted and so on, but common enough.

40:37.349 --> 40:39.031
And you know why they get preserved.

40:39.051 --> 40:40.674
They get preserved because they're art.

40:42.877 --> 40:45.120
You and I can buy medieval art.

40:45.269 --> 40:49.836
for $1,000 we can get a piece of medieval art.

40:49.856 --> 40:54.965
Because it's a lot of money these days, but... Well, no, for $1,000 you can get it.

40:55.045 --> 41:00.193
If that was painted on a panel, on a wood panel, it's $500,000 at least.

41:01.015 --> 41:03.018
Because it's on parchment.

41:03.038 --> 41:05.562
But because it came out of a book, it's $1,000.

41:06.143 --> 41:06.584
It's cheap.

41:07.004 --> 41:09.749
It's so cheap, it's unbelievable.

41:09.789 --> 41:11.091
So it's still a good buy, you think?

41:11.071 --> 41:41.010
course it is uh just compare if you want if you actually wanted something from the 13th century that's there but what do you really want from the 13th century what you really want from the 13th century is uh is not the formal service books that all say the same thing even though they're wonderfully decorated or whatever what you'd really like is say um uh aquinas's notes

41:41.800 --> 41:44.504
Now, we have quite a few of Aquinas' notes.

41:46.026 --> 41:47.207
You mean we in general?

41:47.227 --> 41:49.691
We in general.

41:49.771 --> 41:50.732
The collective we.

41:50.792 --> 41:52.294
The universe of scholars.

41:52.314 --> 41:57.782
The lionine edition of Aquinas is going to take 300 years to do.

41:57.842 --> 42:00.846
There's a lot of Aquinas around.

42:00.926 --> 42:01.787
Say that again.

42:02.749 --> 42:02.949
What?

42:02.969 --> 42:04.351
So what's going to take 300 years?

42:04.371 --> 42:06.694
The lionine edition of Aquinas.

42:06.893 --> 42:07.934
Thomas Aquinas.

42:08.455 --> 42:11.938
This is intended to be the definitive edition.

42:11.958 --> 42:16.483
But does the scholarly community understand and accept that this is a 300-year project?

42:16.603 --> 42:16.883
Sure.

42:17.404 --> 42:19.646
Go to PIMS.

42:20.147 --> 42:26.273
When you go to PIMS, ask Jim Farge about the Aquinas edition.

42:26.474 --> 42:29.036
That's very interesting to me.

42:29.056 --> 42:29.917
Very interesting.

42:29.937 --> 42:35.483
See, with Aquinas, you have to spend, first of all, you have to grow up enough to learn Latin.

42:35.969 --> 42:47.372
and do paleography and, sadly, just someday to be sainted Leonard Boyle.

42:47.433 --> 42:49.477
Well, how many years into it are they?

42:49.998 --> 42:51.200
A few years into it.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.505
Like a few, 10, 20, 30, 50?

42:53.671 --> 43:18.413
oh i it's probably about 20 or so yeah ask him you should they made a decision 20 years ago that this is something and then it won't be until the year 20. well it'll come out it'll come out volume by volume but why did it take this so long well can computers help them do this possibly uh you have to ask them about that but uh the traditional way of doing it was that you

43:18.848 --> 43:22.693
First of all, you learn Latin, then you learn teleography.

43:22.713 --> 43:26.478
If you're lucky, you learned it at Toronto from Father Boyle.

43:27.579 --> 43:28.781
Now, Vatican.

43:29.461 --> 43:32.145
Is he easy to get into the new book?

43:32.165 --> 43:32.806
Sure, sure.

43:33.366 --> 43:34.408
Got him up.

43:34.428 --> 43:38.713
So you don't know about the internet, but the front part of this new book is the sweeping

43:39.554 --> 43:44.979
tour through history, to tell little stories along the way.

43:45.099 --> 43:59.833
Well, Lawrence is a great interview, and if you arrive at the Vatican at 9.30 in the morning, you can get into the Sistine Chapel when nobody's in there.

44:02.035 --> 44:07.080
I plan to go to Italy in June, actually.

44:07.195 --> 44:09.599
Try and get in touch with Leonard.

44:10.641 --> 44:14.347
Oh, I've actually set up the whole thing.

44:14.788 --> 44:24.283
But anyway, then you spend about 30 years learning how to read Aquinas' hand.

44:26.247 --> 44:31.335
Then you have your period of productive research.

44:31.475 --> 44:32.477
Then you die.

44:32.643 --> 44:38.771
Of course you do.

44:38.992 --> 44:40.073
Who would I ask next question?

44:40.133 --> 44:41.655
Ask Jim Farris.

44:41.675 --> 44:55.273
Now, Toronto is an interesting place right now, I think, from that point of view, because the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies was set up by the Brazilian Fathers.

44:56.074 --> 44:58.718
Now, Leonard's not a Brazilian, he's a Dominican.

44:59.474 --> 45:03.079
But the Brazilian Fathers are conking out.

45:05.101 --> 45:08.526
Don Finley told me that there were 245.

45:09.808 --> 45:13.953
That's some years ago, and I read their obits from time to time.

45:14.434 --> 45:18.980
And, you know, there are not many new recruits, so it's going to conk out.

45:19.661 --> 45:24.107
The PIMS will... Now, at the end of 300 years, what will you have?

45:25.048 --> 45:25.549
Who knows?

45:25.569 --> 45:27.331
Will they appreciate what they have?

45:27.812 --> 45:28.873
They...

45:29.748 --> 45:32.952
they'll have a scholarly edition of Aquinas.

45:33.593 --> 45:38.900
In what form, who knows, and who knows whether there will be anyone to appreciate it.

45:39.661 --> 45:42.725
But you've got to have faith.

45:42.745 --> 45:44.808
I mean, this is... I see these in play.

45:44.908 --> 45:49.755
This is... You've got to have faith.

45:52.539 --> 45:58.827
But we can also tell, if you ask these guys, that the way they do research in the

45:59.093 --> 46:02.337
Now, I'll tell you about the Spanish Civil War boot.

46:02.477 --> 46:12.671
This guy in Illinois has a boot made in Spain, but worn by a guy from the Lincoln Brigade, and it has blood on it.

46:13.272 --> 46:15.374
This guy was shot wearing this boot.

46:17.337 --> 46:24.346
And this is not just a museum object or an artifact.

46:24.366 --> 46:28.071
To this guy at Illinois, this is a text.

46:28.135 --> 46:30.638
This can be read.

46:31.920 --> 46:38.950
This is necessary for his research, and he would say that Special Collections should be doing more of that.

46:39.391 --> 46:42.235
They should be broadening their scope, not narrowing it.

46:42.595 --> 46:46.020
They should be getting more stuff, not less.

46:46.701 --> 46:47.342
You can read it.

46:49.084 --> 46:52.489
This is semiotics.

46:52.756 --> 46:54.578
Are you going to interview Echo?

46:54.678 --> 46:57.282
Yes, I already have one sitting there.

46:58.143 --> 47:04.271
Well, ask Echo about a Spanish Civil War boot with blood on it.

47:04.331 --> 47:13.282
It's in a private collection in Illinois of a member of the faculty there.

47:13.402 --> 47:17.307
Does he know of this particular boot, Echo?

47:17.547 --> 47:18.128
I don't know.

47:18.148 --> 47:20.451
But obviously it's a significant

47:20.701 --> 47:41.019
Well, it's just an example of, you know, the one thing that, the one aspect of postmodern literary criticism that does seem to me to have had a real influence is semiotics, that you look at things differently.

47:41.039 --> 47:50.488
You can read signs, but signs aren't necessarily in print or script or you're

47:50.941 --> 47:59.313
in all kinds of forms, but all it really means is you look at it in a different way.

48:00.895 --> 48:09.747
Which is why in Alberto's book he does talk about, you know, the verb to read, you know, we read people's emotions, we read... Sure, sure, sure.

48:10.749 --> 48:15.856
And then the other side of that is you can deconstruct it as well.

48:16.036 --> 48:20.222
You can deconstruct the system that has been

48:20.692 --> 48:26.739
traditionally put on it, and that's all part of it.

48:26.779 --> 48:31.064
And that seems to me to be, you know, an interesting kind of insight.

48:31.525 --> 48:40.356
It's just that it's not really an academic discipline, or it hasn't worked out that way.

48:40.376 --> 48:44.641
Now, I've been to Harvard's Depository out in Southbrook.

48:45.061 --> 48:50.648
These little modules, each one will be able to contain up to 2.5 million items.

48:51.050 --> 48:53.012
And they can do 10 or 20 of these.

48:53.112 --> 48:55.395
So, you know, I mean, they've got space.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.739
And it shares space, by the way, with the primate laboratory.

48:58.779 --> 48:59.499
There are no science.

48:59.519 --> 49:03.704
There are monkeys over here, and there are books over there, which is kind of funny.

49:03.724 --> 49:05.326
I don't know how to deal with that.

49:08.249 --> 49:16.298
But they have a philosophy at Harvard that there was no such thing as a dead book, a dead book at Harvard.

49:16.582 --> 49:18.885
And do you have a similar philosophy there?

49:18.965 --> 49:19.606
Absolutely, yeah.

49:19.806 --> 49:20.107
Sure.

49:20.127 --> 49:22.670
So what do you do with books that you can't handle on the campus?

49:22.710 --> 49:25.554
Well, we can still handle them on the campus.

49:25.594 --> 49:27.496
You'll see Robards so far.

49:28.257 --> 49:31.782
We're going to be, though, into off-site storage.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.726
Of course, there's the Harvard model, which everybody talks about now.

49:35.627 --> 49:37.970
There are some other places that have done this.

49:38.431 --> 49:39.512
Berkeley's done it.

49:39.592 --> 49:41.134
NLC is doing it.

49:41.254 --> 49:43.617
Everybody, every big place is doing it.

49:43.738 --> 49:45.660
Every big place that's downtown.

49:45.860 --> 49:47.182
is doing it.

49:47.302 --> 49:48.604
Well, it wants to do it, though.

49:48.824 --> 49:50.747
A lot of them might just don't want to keep the books.

49:52.349 --> 49:58.859
Well, that seems to me a very odd decision to me.

50:00.141 --> 50:02.484
They figure six million books is a lot of books.

50:02.504 --> 50:03.085
Well, it is.

50:03.906 --> 50:04.807
Who needs more?

50:05.148 --> 50:05.889
But it's not.

50:05.989 --> 50:10.255
I mean, you know, what's the British Library have now?

50:10.315 --> 50:11.597
They must be up to about

50:11.830 --> 50:13.912
15 to 20 years.

50:14.412 --> 50:19.377
And they talk about being all over the place.

50:19.457 --> 50:21.579
They are now and still will be.

50:22.379 --> 50:23.480
It's a new place in Baltimore.

50:23.540 --> 50:27.124
I mean, they are a problem.

50:27.184 --> 50:28.505
They take out space.

50:29.206 --> 50:36.772
They have a phrase at Cornell that I learned there for the first time, which is called phased deterioration.

50:37.093 --> 50:39.695
You ever heard that phrase before?

50:39.735 --> 50:39.795
No.

50:40.535 --> 50:43.237
They've really gone into this, you see.

50:43.317 --> 50:48.782
Basically, it's taking a book, when we make a decision, and we become an associate.

50:48.802 --> 50:54.827
Was the chapter on the National Yiddish Book Center, because, of course, we participated in that.

50:54.847 --> 50:57.549
We've had stuff from them, and we've sent stuff to them.

50:57.569 --> 50:58.810
Aaron, isn't he something?

50:58.891 --> 50:59.431
Incredible.

50:59.451 --> 51:03.975
As a kid, this is a little... That's... Totally off the wall.

51:04.315 --> 51:08.819
Yeah, but rescue the whole literature.

51:08.839 --> 51:10.120
I mean, that's incredible.

51:10.673 --> 51:40.613
um and uh michael's jewish of course so and and knows yiddish so it uh means something to him and and in fact the collect the yiddish collection at u of t is quite good it's all in the stacks it's in the main stacks but we we have major hebrew stuff now too from a private collector and of course aaron's stuff is yiddish yeah yeah that's that's what interests michael but uh

51:40.829 --> 51:41.971
collection development.

51:41.991 --> 51:57.172
You see, this is a, I've seen Barton filing, I've been trying to get this, eight months, so finally my wife, I said I'd be down 15 minutes, it was 20, I called home, I said, Dr. Gregorian's assistant just called and see you Saturday.

51:57.212 --> 51:59.435
I said, great, tell him I'll be there.

52:01.158 --> 52:07.927
But, you know, he has, I don't know the numbers, and I don't want to say doubled, but he has really added to the collections at Brown.

52:07.947 --> 52:09.790
Now, he went in there,

52:10.057 --> 52:21.599
And he also commissioned a study, a woman, the dean, I don't know, it was in the New York Times, to determine what students read, and I'm dying to see that in that particular study.

52:22.080 --> 52:25.787
But, you know, the notion that you have some kind of date,

52:26.223 --> 52:39.859
or time frame within which something has to be read is totally at odds with the definition of a research collection is potential.

52:40.160 --> 52:40.700
I don't care.

52:40.780 --> 52:41.481
Say again?

52:41.501 --> 52:42.122
Potential.

52:42.242 --> 52:42.843
Potential.

52:42.863 --> 52:44.445
A potential reader somewhere.

52:44.785 --> 52:45.506
I don't care.

52:46.187 --> 52:54.677
If I buy a book, and I probably bought a lot of them in my time for the university that isn't looked at for 100 years,

52:55.113 --> 52:55.934
It's there.

52:55.994 --> 53:06.448
The prologue to my new book begins with this little story I tell tonight, which I complete my remarks with, and it's getting a book.

53:06.468 --> 53:12.576
I don't want to blow it, but it's being collected in the works at the moment.

53:15.119 --> 53:19.525
You said your obvious mission in life was to fill this building, which opened in 1973.

53:19.745 --> 53:21.648
Was that the year?

53:21.668 --> 53:21.728
No.

53:22.147 --> 53:36.851
Well, UT is an example of a younger place, to take Cornell's, which consciously, in the 60s or 70s, am I right?

53:37.011 --> 53:37.933
Yeah.

53:37.953 --> 53:46.346
Decided that it needed to build research collections to support its graduate programs in a variety of disciplines.

53:46.366 --> 53:47.208
That's here you're talking about.

53:48.350 --> 53:49.251
Well, sure, it was quite

53:49.737 --> 53:56.923
I can tell you a long story about the history of science and collections and why we have such good ones.

53:57.764 --> 54:08.594
Well, why is that?

54:08.614 --> 54:19.103
Because in about 1964, and this is when the

54:19.387 --> 54:48.685
university had decided that it was really wonderful thanks great sure um consciously decided it was going to expand the school graduate studies and offer a lot more doctoral level programs and and beat up the ones that had but

54:49.643 --> 54:55.870
They set up an institute for the history and science... History and philosophy.

54:55.910 --> 54:58.753
History and philosophy of science and technology.

54:59.174 --> 55:10.987
And at Toronto, the words institute, center, and program have very specific meanings.

55:11.007 --> 55:13.670
It has to do with funding.

55:16.273 --> 55:18.115
Institutes have their own faculty.

55:18.871 --> 55:20.253
And class appointments.

55:20.273 --> 55:22.176
Centers only have class appointments.

55:22.257 --> 55:26.944
Programs kind of get along.

55:28.847 --> 55:42.229
But someone had the wick to ask whether, in fact, there was anything to support, any research collections to support this program.

55:43.930 --> 55:47.956
support meaning interest from the scholars, right?

55:47.976 --> 55:50.760
Is there anything for anyone to do any research with?

55:52.403 --> 56:07.285
So they went and looked around, and they discovered, well, yes, there were a few things, and medicine is included in this as well, to a certain extent.

56:09.429 --> 56:11.592
But the real answer was no.

56:12.483 --> 56:25.537
So the library said to the central administration, if you really want to have an institute that's going to work, you're going to have to fund the building of the collections.

56:27.919 --> 56:33.024
So they said, OK, ground some extra money.

56:33.585 --> 56:37.069
I've been waiting eight years for somebody to tell you a story like this.

56:37.129 --> 56:39.351
An election that actually was formed

56:39.753 --> 56:45.501
and the strength of the aspirations, the spelling of the aspirations.

56:45.801 --> 56:47.303
Then they did two things.

56:47.944 --> 56:53.271
There was this money, started buying great works in the history of science, and you could still buy them then.

56:53.291 --> 56:59.039
Great works now being the printed text, or are we going up to special collections?

56:59.059 --> 57:09.152
Oh no, going up to special collections, because at the same time, the year that I came, 1967, Stillman Drake came.

57:10.212 --> 57:28.580
Stillman Drake was an investment banker in San Francisco who formed an interest in the works of Galileo and have collected for years one of Jake's old customers and so on.

57:29.662 --> 57:34.549
And he did a translation of the dialogue with Diagolo

57:35.677 --> 58:04.097
of 1632 the first english translation since um salisbury in 1664 and got einstein to write a preface for him and uh published it so he was well known but he was still working in the bank and trotto came along and the guy who was the first director of this institute

58:04.398 --> 58:08.503
had been an undergraduate at Berkeley with Stillman.

58:08.543 --> 58:11.507
And here's Stillman with his collection and all his knowledge.

58:11.567 --> 58:17.615
So Toronto hired him as a full professor straight out of the investment bank.

58:19.838 --> 58:24.464
He was then in his 50s, late 50s, might have been 60.

58:25.505 --> 58:31.873
He came up and he brought his collection.

58:32.274 --> 58:34.236
His collection was put on deposit.

58:35.110 --> 58:39.915
And we started buying it, and I'm still buying it from his estate so much a year.

58:39.955 --> 58:41.857
And then he gave us stuff as well.

58:42.097 --> 58:43.179
Wow.

58:44.500 --> 58:50.827
And as a consequence, we have the best Galileo collection in North America.

58:51.427 --> 58:54.851
We have the only copy of Galileo's first book outside Italy.

58:56.653 --> 58:58.775
And you acquire this?

58:58.795 --> 58:59.035
Yeah.

58:59.936 --> 59:01.658
Now, do you have the...

59:02.110 --> 59:04.872
the fiscal backing of your institution to do this?

59:05.173 --> 59:09.036
You certainly can't just make a decision on your own that we're going to do this.

59:09.076 --> 59:10.557
You have to get money.

59:10.618 --> 59:12.819
You can do anything you want if you can find the money.

59:13.340 --> 59:19.265
This is a decision made by the university.

59:19.305 --> 59:31.476
This is a decision made by the university administration when it was pointed out that there needed to be more funding for material like this in order to support the kind of

59:31.945 --> 59:35.028
graduate studies that they wanted to open up.

59:35.829 --> 59:36.450
And so they did.

59:36.550 --> 59:42.997
They put a lot of money into building special collections in that time period.

59:43.017 --> 59:48.803
Now, it's not that they, well, I guess, proportionately, they don't put quite as much in.

59:49.064 --> 59:51.786
More of it comes from, well, it comes from a variety of places.

59:51.807 --> 59:53.548
Well, we have to get more of it from outside.

59:53.989 --> 59:55.090
Can you measure this?

59:55.110 --> 01:00:01.497
Can you measure the results, the effect this has on the institution, the quality of the students that you attract?

01:00:01.747 --> 01:00:04.570
The story of the work that emerges from it?

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:09.636
Sure, all you have to do is talk to some of those guys in the history of science.

01:00:10.497 --> 01:00:12.920
And what specifically, what kinds of things do you offer?

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.284
What is a student looking for, a scholar looking for?

01:00:16.304 --> 01:00:18.727
I mean, is it something that hasn't been looked at before?

01:00:19.127 --> 01:00:20.809
Lots of it is, yeah, sure.

01:00:21.811 --> 01:00:28.058
So it gives, of course, an opportunity to write about something that hasn't been done before.

01:00:28.308 --> 01:00:32.935
Never been done before.
