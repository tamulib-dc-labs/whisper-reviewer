WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:04.344
We're talking with Professor Geoffrey Nunberg.

00:04.644 --> 00:10.010
Just tell me, Professor, where you teach and what you teach.

00:10.030 --> 00:16.076
I teach at Stanford University, and I'm a principal scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.

00:16.557 --> 00:17.678
Uh-huh.

00:17.758 --> 00:20.841
I interviewed Mike Keller when I was out there last.

00:20.861 --> 00:22.523
I was down at Stanford.

00:22.603 --> 00:25.566
I wish to, well, I'll be out again.

00:25.606 --> 00:28.048
Maybe I can come visit you the next time around.

00:28.068 --> 00:30.030
Could you tell me specifically, you know.

00:30.110 --> 00:31.692
I say I'm in linguistics at Stanford.

00:31.672 --> 00:32.253
Okay.

00:32.273 --> 00:36.640
Could you tell me how you got interested in this particular subject, the future?

00:36.660 --> 00:48.961
Well, I've been working with these technologies in various ways for a number of years in my work at Xerox and whether on the Dictionary of the Future.

00:49.021 --> 00:52.247
Let me tell you what I think.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.309
Dictionary of the Future?

00:53.389 --> 00:53.489
Yeah.

00:53.509 --> 00:55.873
I mean, look, I'm among my...

00:56.326 --> 00:58.068
I've sort of had a foot in both camps.

00:58.148 --> 01:05.518
I'm the usage editor and chair of the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, which is back there at Houghton Mifflin.

01:05.538 --> 01:15.130
And I also work on the application of digital technologies to various linguistic problems, among them the building of the Dictionary of the Future.

01:15.651 --> 01:21.979
And that's one example, but throughout this I've had a foot in both camps.

01:22.685 --> 01:27.630
both the culture of the traditional printed book and the technology.

01:29.072 --> 01:32.756
Pardon me for going off track, but what is the dictionary of the future?

01:33.316 --> 01:46.971
Well, I mean, we can ask what would it be like to have a dictionary in the... What we have now are simply digital adaptations of traditional print dictionaries.

01:47.592 --> 01:53.840
But that's not really a digital dictionary no more than when you watch an opera on television, you're watching a television show.

01:54.441 --> 02:10.242
So the question is, what would it be like if we started to build, if Johnson had this technology and started to build a dictionary from scratch in the middle of the 18th century?

02:11.324 --> 02:13.667
For example, would it be necessary to excerpt

02:14.305 --> 02:26.341
all of the quotations he used to justify the meaning of a word, when after all you could have all those texts available and accessible wherever they were on servers and so on.

02:26.362 --> 02:41.342
Would it be necessary to give a highly abstract rule for using the word in the form of a definition if it was possible to look at the actual use in question in its context?

02:41.879 --> 02:54.755
and build a system that was capable of saying, oh, well, in this context, this word means X, and then merely take you to some other set of examples from Addison or Steele or the online versions of those that exemplify that use.

02:55.756 --> 03:05.929
That's just one example, but the structure of a dictionary might change enormously, not to mention the possibility of providing other kinds of illustrations of, I mean, if you look in the dictionary, it doesn't mean the word tango.

03:06.567 --> 03:17.243
You find something like a Latin dance in a 2-4 rhythm with a characteristic pattern of step, step, step, step, step, step, close, which is not very illustrative of the meaning of the word.

03:18.665 --> 03:23.632
So you can imagine all kinds of ways we could deploy the technology to make the dictionary very different.

03:23.652 --> 03:26.316
You mean giving a visual demonstration?

03:26.336 --> 03:34.448
Giving a visual illustration of the meaning of the word or an oral illustration or simply by...

03:34.732 --> 03:41.443
providing citations for the use of a word that were not decontextualized the way they have to be in a standard dictionary.

03:41.463 --> 03:46.231
We actually built a system at our Grenoble Research Center.

03:46.752 --> 03:48.154
It's a little bilingual dictionary.

03:49.075 --> 03:56.287
And for understanding idioms, what it does is look at the context of a word.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.731
So if you say, he will hold the fort,

03:59.015 --> 04:04.642
You look up fort, you're taken to the entry for hold the fort, the corresponding entry for hold the fort.

04:04.682 --> 04:07.505
Fascinating.

04:07.525 --> 04:09.367
When is something like this going to be produced?

04:09.808 --> 04:16.075
Well, the little bilingual versions of that, there are a number of what we call functionalities involved here.

04:16.656 --> 04:22.643
One is the ability to analyze the context in which problematic occurrence of a word is found.

04:23.281 --> 04:44.631
That's there now, and for bilingual dictionaries it can be very useful because you have lots of idioms and expressions that consist of more than one word, and when you're looking them up for purpose of understanding their meaning in another language, it's very inefficient to be taken to the full entry for each of the words and then have to go down the long list to...

04:45.218 --> 04:47.141
to find the particular idiom in question.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.005
It's much more efficient if this thing can just grab onto the context.

04:50.025 --> 04:54.612
So that exists, and that's being marketed in this limited form for bilingual dictionaries.

04:54.632 --> 04:56.435
Now, you said something about Houghton-Mifflin.

04:56.455 --> 04:58.438
Is this something you're doing with Houghton-Mifflin?

04:58.498 --> 05:04.387
No, this is something I'm doing, I'm sorry, with the Xerox European research project.

05:04.928 --> 05:07.832
That Houghton-Mifflin, on the other hand, so that's one leg of this thing.

05:07.852 --> 05:08.874
I mean, you can use it.

05:09.034 --> 05:10.416
The one leg of this thing is we're building...

05:10.835 --> 05:14.779
And we're building all kinds of tools, tools for natural language retrieval and search.

05:14.839 --> 05:31.655
I mean, right now, anybody who's tried to look for something on the web realizes that, you know, it's a mess, so we're building tools that enable you to look with something more than the very inefficient methods you have now, and that's something else I'm involved in.

05:34.158 --> 05:36.941
I'm just going to give you the material now, and we'll go back and put it.

05:37.441 --> 05:37.761
That's fine.

05:37.901 --> 05:40.504
This is just fine.

05:41.125 --> 05:50.862
And all of this is involved in the production of multimedia documents and various new kinds of documents and the web and the links and so on.

05:51.183 --> 06:03.825
All of these technologies I'm in the midst of, and particularly a place like the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, which is the place where a lot of these technologies were originally developed, where the mouse was developed, where the Ethernet was developed, where the bitmap display and the desktop metaphor were developed.

06:04.295 --> 06:10.522
At the same time, I've personally been involved in, as I say, the traditional book.

06:10.722 --> 06:14.687
I'm the usage editor and chair of the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary.

06:15.107 --> 06:28.362
That's the most conservative role at the most conservative dictionary, and the dictionary is probably the most conservative of literary genres in the sense that, you know, you look at one of Johnson's novels, like Rasselas,

06:29.101 --> 06:31.544
And it's almost incomprehensible to modern students.

06:31.564 --> 06:33.526
You have to explain to them what this is and so on and so forth.

06:33.547 --> 06:43.599
But students look at a 1918-century dictionary, and apart from the fact that the language itself has changed, the format and the structure of the book is utterly unchanged in the last 250 years.

06:45.161 --> 06:53.171
So the dictionary is not just a book written by books, but in a certain sense it was a book written by books in 1755 and not changed since.

06:53.191 --> 06:54.973
So here are these two cultures.

06:55.696 --> 06:57.919
Do you have sympathies with both?

06:58.059 --> 06:58.720
Sure.

06:59.180 --> 07:16.941
And I think the other reason for wanting to do this is that when you listen to what's being said on both sides, there's an almost willful pig-headedness, misinterpretation, dogmatism on both sides of the issue.

07:16.981 --> 07:19.965
On the one hand, you have these triumphalists of the new order.

07:20.452 --> 07:30.512
to insist that the book is going to, that digital technology is going to be introduced and sweep all the way before it the old line from

07:31.218 --> 07:34.681
Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame, this will go back.

07:34.981 --> 07:38.685
That Hugo references three times in this.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.246
Right.

07:40.426 --> 07:45.271
I think Eiko made the point that you can't discuss this without mentioning it.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.191
Could you explain it?

07:46.372 --> 07:49.294
Because nobody ever really explains the significance of that quote.

07:49.555 --> 07:52.157
Well, there's an assumption that we all know it.

07:52.177 --> 07:57.141
The Archbishop, the Archdeacon Frollo, and this is, of course, something that somehow didn't make it into the Disney version.

07:58.122 --> 08:01.225
Disney's not going to make the point about books, certainly.

08:01.205 --> 08:15.163
Um is in as I recall is in a print shop and holds up a printed book and uh and looks at the cathedral in the background, and says this will kill that, whereby he he means um

08:16.814 --> 08:27.253
Whether the stained glass of the windows or architecture in general, the book will somehow prevail over the symbolic function.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.655
That's a great quote.

08:28.675 --> 08:39.835
Somebody observed that when you look at the Bibliothèque de France, the New Bibliothèque de France in Paris, you're led to say, well, this is Perrault, the architect of Perrault's Revenge.

08:40.439 --> 09:03.342
uh over over uh, we'll see whether the book will kill architecture. Have you been there yet? Yeah I was just I was actually in the new building. Do you have a contact name? I'm planning... Do you take phones? Yeah. Um let's talk about that after. Okay it depends what you need. And so yeah well. I want to go. I'm just setting up. It's hard to get in. I mean that's that's why well if I was with Paula Claire last week and he

09:03.322 --> 09:07.668
He said he might be able to throw a couple blocks for me, and hopefully he could do that.

09:07.808 --> 09:10.832
But in any case, go ahead.

09:11.192 --> 09:12.474
You know, let me just interject.

09:12.514 --> 09:24.390
You know, Paul LeClaire does say, you know, Paul LeClaire at the New York Public Library, we discussed this issue, and he says, you know, we are at a time when we are spending more money on new libraries than ever.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.172
You know, and he points out Frankfurt.

09:26.192 --> 09:27.193
He points out Paris.

09:27.454 --> 09:28.635
Right, absolutely, yeah.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.898
And, you know, I mean, is there a paradox here that,

09:30.878 --> 09:32.520
No, I mean, I don't think so.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.822
I mean, I don't think so for two reasons.

09:34.243 --> 09:37.948
Because, well, let me drop the other shoe on that.

09:37.968 --> 09:38.088
Okay.

09:38.589 --> 09:40.351
Because I just had one term.

09:40.371 --> 09:40.772
No, that's right.

09:40.812 --> 09:41.874
Go anywhere you want, by the way.

09:41.894 --> 09:42.595
I'm just, you know.

09:42.615 --> 09:47.001
No, no, because I said, well, you know, on the one hand, there's all this excessive rhetoric of the triumphalists.

09:47.021 --> 09:54.972
On the other hand, there are all the traditionalists who are insisting, you're not going to take my books away and nothing is as good.

09:54.992 --> 09:58.557
I can't take a laptop to bed, which to my mind is mostly a matter of the fact that it is.

09:58.874 --> 10:04.345
folds the wrong way.

10:04.713 --> 10:07.095
You know, this is all silly.

10:07.115 --> 10:09.057
I just saw a piece in the London Times.

10:09.077 --> 10:10.479
It actually misquoted me, rather.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.021
Is that right?

10:12.081 --> 10:15.084
I would not re-respond, but not to the New Times.

10:15.164 --> 10:18.147
But they said, oh, well, you know, the book is silly.

10:18.167 --> 10:18.968
The book is here to stay.

10:18.988 --> 10:21.230
This Internet is just a nine-day's wonder.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.551
And that's silly, too.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.613
That's how you were quoted in the Times?

10:24.974 --> 10:25.454
I'm sorry?

10:25.474 --> 10:27.717
I was quoted in the Times.

10:27.757 --> 10:28.958
Let me see if I have the thing here.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.982
Somebody sent it to me electronically.

10:34.312 --> 10:39.798
Was it with respect to this book, The Future of... It was with respect to an earlier article I had done.

10:42.220 --> 10:44.082
It was by a guy named Simon Jenkins.

10:47.586 --> 10:59.779
And he said... He quoted me as saying... I mean, he just quoted me as saying the opposite way.

11:00.468 --> 11:01.831
Don't worry about it.

11:01.851 --> 11:03.634
I'm just curious about what the context is.

11:04.316 --> 11:05.939
Let's go on with what we're doing.

11:12.592 --> 11:16.840
Your own name jumps right out at you.

11:18.575 --> 11:20.538
All of this will soon shake down.

11:20.598 --> 11:32.636
What is absurd is for screen communication to require for its self-esteem the ridiculing of books.

11:32.656 --> 11:41.930
Highly paid seminar addicts such as MIT's Nicholas Negroponte deride the book for having to be taken down from a shelf and, quote, accessed one person at a time.

11:41.950 --> 11:46.236
Jeffrey Nunberg declares in the Berkeley book, which isn't mentioned yet, I don't know what that means,

11:46.570 --> 11:47.953
I mean, I know what book he's talking about.

11:48.153 --> 11:49.235
Obviously, he's talking about this book.

11:49.296 --> 11:53.123
Most books as, quote, bound printed volumes will likely disappear soon.

11:53.825 --> 11:54.686
That's not what you say.

11:55.127 --> 11:58.093
And then the deconstructors proclaim that the closed book is dead.

11:58.113 --> 12:00.218
So, no, I mean, that's the opposite.

12:00.238 --> 12:01.220
I mean, I read this book.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.326
In another article, I've said that...

12:04.930 --> 12:10.078
that most books will disappear, but only the uninteresting ones.

12:10.278 --> 12:12.221
Do you do believe that most books will disappear?

12:12.421 --> 12:20.834
Well, I think, no, what I think I said, as bound printed volumes, if you take books as bound printed volumes, then most of them will disappear.

12:20.894 --> 12:24.940
But even the ones, you mean the new ones or the ones that are in existence?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.923
There's a number of bound printed volumes in the world.

12:27.784 --> 12:29.487
Most of them are...

12:29.956 --> 12:40.212
Parts catalogs and phone directories and schedules and various kinds of commercial records and so on.

12:40.253 --> 12:42.236
I mean, there are books that have no cultural interest.

12:42.356 --> 12:42.757
Okay.

12:42.777 --> 12:45.020
And whose occurrence in this bound printed form?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.142
This is what I said in the article.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.440
or the American Society, whose occurrence in this form is a mere contingency.

12:49.721 --> 12:56.473
And, you know, a replacement by digital media should be of concern to nobody, but, you know, who could argue with that?

12:56.493 --> 12:58.877
We should all be happy that that many trees will come.

12:58.897 --> 13:05.869
You know, Paul mentioned that, for instance, in April they had a conference in New York, a summit of libraries.

13:05.849 --> 13:08.292
And he said, he did a little figuring.

13:08.312 --> 13:11.917
He said, guess how many books were represented by the people who were here?

13:12.017 --> 13:13.258
It was a fascinating question.

13:13.379 --> 13:17.203
If you were to take a wild guess, let's say there were 50 libraries there.

13:18.225 --> 13:21.469
How many books do you think their combined holdings would have come to?

13:21.689 --> 13:23.231
And there's a purpose to the question here.

13:23.852 --> 13:25.093
Fifty books?

13:25.254 --> 13:26.976
Fifty major research libraries?

13:27.116 --> 13:27.216
Yeah.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.402
I don't know, 150, 200.

13:32.422 --> 13:33.062
500 million.

13:33.082 --> 13:34.463
500 million, interesting, yeah.

13:34.483 --> 13:40.349
Yeah, and so, I mean, my point is, when you're saying that the book will disappear, you can't be including those 500 million books.

13:40.369 --> 13:43.551
No, I'm not including, I mean, well, there's an interesting, we can come back to that in a second.

13:43.571 --> 13:45.993
Because nobody's going to digitize all of these books either.

13:46.013 --> 13:51.298
No, I mean, first of all, there are, what, 100 million or so items in the... 120 in the Library of Congress.

13:51.318 --> 13:53.180
In the Library of Congress.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.341
52 million in New York.

13:54.381 --> 13:59.245
That's a difficult notion, because a lot of those are things, there's a guy named Prof Gifford there, we were talking about it, because, you know, we...

13:59.225 --> 14:02.531
We've got things like Houdini's notebooks, scrapbooks.

14:02.551 --> 14:08.722
I mean, that's an item, and it's an undigitizable item in the sense that it's got all these tickets and so on.

14:09.043 --> 14:12.669
How many pages that represents, or whatever is difficult to say.

14:13.250 --> 14:18.600
But if you figure the cost of about...

14:19.238 --> 14:22.081
20 to 25 cents a page for digitization.

14:22.482 --> 14:23.543
Is that what it's down to now?

14:23.663 --> 14:26.947
Well, that's about... That's what the French figured as a franc a page.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.829
It's coming down dramatically then, isn't it?

14:28.849 --> 14:29.750
No, that's about right.

14:29.790 --> 14:37.819
I mean, that's for digitization of... Let's assume we have stacks and stacks of economics textbooks.

14:37.839 --> 14:47.070
These are books that don't have to be handled with excessive delicacy because we have copies of them somewhere else and assume that they're being... And they always have to be done.

14:47.110 --> 14:48.992
I mean, the techniques for...

14:49.546 --> 14:56.879
Actually digitizing books, I mean, you know, physically digitizing books are mechanical technologies.

14:57.620 --> 15:02.569
And so they're not subject to the kinds of growth curves that digital technologies are.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.773
But I say, you know, you have to turn pages.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.958
Now, we have new technologies with using air blades and things like that.

15:08.399 --> 15:09.180
Air, A-I-R?

15:10.462 --> 15:11.925
A-I-R, B-L-A-D-E-S.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.388
It's just a blade made of air, right?

15:16.209 --> 15:19.154
Rather than actually physically touching the page, you can just use air and turn it.

15:19.595 --> 15:25.846
And places like Xerox, who are in the business of moving papers, that's what we make are these large boxes that move paper, right?

15:26.166 --> 15:27.829
Is Xerox doing this out where you are?

15:28.090 --> 15:28.771
Yeah.

15:28.791 --> 15:31.455
Do you think it would be worth my while to come out there and take a look at this?

15:31.475 --> 15:32.697
To see Xerox panel out there research?

15:32.778 --> 15:34.200
Well, it's an amazing place.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.728
This is not going to be a once-over-lightly section.

15:37.768 --> 15:39.873
I'm really doing my work here.

15:39.913 --> 15:41.958
I don't know whether for this piece it makes sense to do that.

15:42.219 --> 15:44.023
It's interesting.

15:44.263 --> 15:47.611
There are two technologies.

15:47.631 --> 15:51.480
Let me wrap that and then come back to the technologies that could affect the book.

15:52.085 --> 15:59.181
In any event, the cost of scanning may come down in the future, but it's not going to come down the way the cost of computation has come down, because you're moving paper.

16:00.323 --> 16:03.771
And basically it's going to be, for the most part, something that people do with their hands.

16:03.831 --> 16:09.503
The cost of capture, whether it's books or slides or transparencies or art or whatever, it's just going to cost a certain amount.

16:09.523 --> 16:11.207
It's going to cost that much for a long time.

16:11.710 --> 16:16.235
Yeah, that's a labor price, basically, the cost of capture.

16:16.255 --> 16:17.977
It's basically a labor price, yeah.

16:18.017 --> 16:25.304
I mean, you have automatic page turners, for instance, for the blind, and they experimented with these at the Bibliotheque de France and other places.

16:26.846 --> 16:28.367
But the problem is that they're not very good.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.089
First of all, they can damage books, right?

16:30.109 --> 16:30.670
Now, it's all right.

16:30.690 --> 16:38.578
As I say, if you're just trying to get rid of one of your 400 copies of Samuels,

16:39.098 --> 16:47.527
the second edition of Samuelson's Economics, you know, whatever, we need one copy of that edition or something, you know, then you don't care if you tear off half of them, of course.

16:47.547 --> 16:50.276
But on the one hand, they're not, you know, they can damage the books.

16:50.296 --> 16:52.062
On the other hand, they sometimes skip pages.

16:52.919 --> 16:56.807
Well, it doesn't matter if they're readers for the handicapped.

16:56.827 --> 16:58.410
You know, I was up at Cornell.

16:58.470 --> 16:59.572
Oh, we've seen what they're doing.

16:59.693 --> 17:01.737
I spent, yeah, in fact, I'm going to go back.

17:01.757 --> 17:03.861
If that's Xerox, I mean, that was Xerox.

17:03.881 --> 17:04.402
Is that right?

17:04.543 --> 17:05.925
Yeah, we put that project.

17:05.945 --> 17:11.256
You know, but they're doing some things that invite serious criticism.

17:11.336 --> 17:14.202
You know, I mean, they're digitizing some books.

17:14.182 --> 17:16.189
The number is not enormous.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.135
It's about 3,500 so far.

17:18.155 --> 17:18.677
Right.

17:18.697 --> 17:20.122
But, I mean, I was in that room.

17:20.182 --> 17:21.908
I mean, these things look like veal cutlets.

17:21.968 --> 17:23.835
I mean, they've been stripped and filleted.

17:23.855 --> 17:26.925
Well, yeah, you have to assume, I mean, there are two things there.

17:27.850 --> 17:30.555
There are two reasons for guillotining a book.

17:30.635 --> 17:34.763
One is, as I say, it's one of your 15 copies of the second edition of Samuelson's Second Art.

17:34.783 --> 17:35.765
You just don't care.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.450
I mean, this is a book of which there are a lot of copies.

17:38.871 --> 17:41.556
Some of these books exist in no other format there, though, either.

17:41.576 --> 17:43.600
To recycle them.

17:43.620 --> 17:47.648
On the other hand, there are some books, like those they use in the Cornell Collection,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.189
which have no artifactual value.

17:50.209 --> 17:52.471
I mean, they're 19th century mathematics texts, for example.

17:52.991 --> 17:55.153
I mean, they're not, you know, they were printed on acid-based paper.

17:55.173 --> 17:56.975
They're not first editions of this or that.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.598
And they've got only one read left of them.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.700
You really can't turn those pages more.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.461
I like that phrase.

18:03.481 --> 18:04.222
I like that.

18:04.302 --> 18:06.143
One more read left.

18:06.304 --> 18:15.492
And then you may want to... Now, my sense is that... And then the third thing is, yeah, there should be technologies that enable... I mean, we're working on them, and Canon is working on them, and so on, that enable you...

18:16.079 --> 18:16.800
to digit.

18:16.820 --> 18:21.387
The problem is that if you don't have a flat, right now the best digitization is with flatbed scanners.

18:22.208 --> 18:30.981
But there are technologies we're working on and we've got them at PARC using, on the one hand, using new technologies for turning pages with air, for example, rather than physically manipulating the page.

18:31.001 --> 18:40.375
And on the other hand, ways of computationally correcting the distortions involved in taking a picture of a curved, you know, not flat page.

18:41.857 --> 18:45.563
You take a picture, you open the book 45 degrees and take a picture of it and then you have

18:46.100 --> 18:49.868
a kind of computational device that flattens that image.

18:51.551 --> 18:52.613
Can I jump around a little bit?

18:52.633 --> 18:52.854
Sure.

18:53.094 --> 18:59.548
Do you have any thoughts at all on this whole concept of hypertext?

18:59.568 --> 19:02.213
Okay, let me just drop something in there and then get that out of the way.

19:02.534 --> 19:06.943
So the point is that the digitization of books, I mean, those 500 million books is probably too many.

19:07.818 --> 19:12.503
in the libraries of the United States in the sense that... This is the world, by the way.

19:12.744 --> 19:13.925
Yeah, libraries of the world, okay.

19:13.965 --> 19:20.913
That's probably too many, particularly if you take not just those, but if you take all the research libraries in America.

19:21.874 --> 19:25.879
There are probably more books than... How do I put this?

19:25.899 --> 19:30.484
There are a lot of books you could probably get rid of just in the sense that

19:31.223 --> 19:39.938
I mean, there's a book, for instance, published in 1935 by Sterling Leonard called The Doctrine of Correctness in English Usage that I have often consulted, right?

19:40.579 --> 19:44.746
I went to the University of Pennsylvania once, and I was there, and I went to the library to take it out, and there it was.

19:45.207 --> 19:52.700
It had been last taken out in 1948 by Albert C. Baugh, B-A-U-G-H, who was a famous philologist.

19:52.740 --> 19:56.286
And then about three years later, I was out at UCLA, and I went to the library.

19:56.789 --> 20:03.280
And I took out another copy of that book, and they had that book, and it had last been taken out by Albert C. Ball in 1952.

20:03.560 --> 20:13.397
And I had the image that I would go around the country in Ball's footsteps, and at every library would have a copy of this book, just so that every 50, 30, or 40 years...

20:13.917 --> 20:20.124
Albert C. Ball or me or whoever was going to succeed me in 30 years would have it available.

20:20.384 --> 20:21.345
But you know what?

20:21.406 --> 20:23.188
That person's going to need it 30 years from now.

20:23.208 --> 20:23.768
Well, that's right.

20:24.229 --> 20:36.803
The question of whether a copy of that book has to exist in every one of the research libraries or whether it would make sense simply to say, well, look, we need to have a couple of copies of that book.

20:37.357 --> 20:40.220
And this is a book of no artifactual value, as I say.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.141
I see.

20:42.261 --> 20:44.003
It's a scholarly work published in the 1930s.

20:44.023 --> 20:47.086
Of course, somebody's making that decision, though.

20:47.326 --> 21:04.341
But the point is that if you have a library, for example, I mean, in theory, how many books could you eliminate from each of the... I mean, if you take a book that's accessed only once every 20 years at each library, the question is how many of these libraries and how many books do you have in the library like that?

21:04.361 --> 21:07.144
If you could reduce your collection by 20 or 30 percent,

21:07.664 --> 21:09.926
But you don't even have to get rid of them, put them in storage somewhere.

21:09.946 --> 21:13.249
You know, well, Harvard, you've heard of their depository.

21:13.269 --> 21:14.210
Right, they've got a depository.

21:14.230 --> 21:19.575
The Bibliothèque de France has a couple of million books in a depository out in the Marne.

21:20.175 --> 21:20.616
Is that right?

21:21.016 --> 21:22.998
And why not?

21:23.078 --> 21:24.079
I mean, just put them out there.

21:24.619 --> 21:34.568
If they're digitally accessible, and if you can, and we'll come to this in a second, if you can print them locally, what I really want is to be able to have that text if I need it, right?

21:35.489 --> 21:35.629
Mm-hmm.

21:36.385 --> 21:53.964
Suppose, you know, it doesn't save a lot of money for one library to put that book away, but if every library puts its copy of that book away, and this is replicated for a couple hundred thousand books in the collection, depending on the size of the collection, then libraries, you know, they need less space, they can devote their resources to other things, and so on.

21:54.364 --> 22:02.393
And at the same time, that book, for instance, let's say it's a 19th century math text, that's a good example, because I take it not many people actually are interested in those books.

22:02.778 --> 22:03.539
that they have at Cornell.

22:03.559 --> 22:05.301
And who could argue with that?

22:05.321 --> 22:08.926
I mean, it's, you know, so just let Cornell digitize them, right?

22:08.986 --> 22:11.409
Let them save the, you know, let's have copies by all means.

22:11.429 --> 22:21.061
I mean, these are books that are only historians of mathematics or something, which is not to say that they absolutely preserve the books, preserve the, you know, I'm not saying get rid of the books.

22:21.081 --> 22:27.469
I'm saying once they're digitized, if I'm doing history of mathematics at the University of Arizona, I don't have to have all these books there.

22:27.905 --> 22:31.613
All I have to do is be able to access them via the web.

22:32.014 --> 22:39.148
And if I want a copy in a print version for reading, and of course these are not the kinds of texts, they're not novels that you sit and take to the beach and so on.

22:39.168 --> 22:45.762
If I want a copy for reading, I can simply send it to a local printer, a digital printer in the basement of the library.

22:46.315 --> 22:48.841
And have a fair copy made at 400 DPI.

22:48.881 --> 22:50.966
You've seen the Cornell process, how they do the printing.

22:51.347 --> 22:52.730
Have a 400 DPI copy made.

22:52.750 --> 22:53.773
It's very impressive, actually.

22:53.793 --> 22:55.437
It's perfect bound, and I can take it wherever I want.

22:55.457 --> 23:02.113
And whenever I want that book, the ball book or whatever, it's accessible to me wherever there's a digital printer, at a university bookstore, at a...

23:02.667 --> 23:05.490
a university library, at a commercial printers, whatever.

23:06.230 --> 23:09.673
You know, there's a question, and it's... I'm sorry.

23:09.693 --> 23:10.554
I'll shut up.

23:10.574 --> 23:13.037
I just thought I heard a period.

23:13.097 --> 23:16.139
And this is a model of publishing, too.

23:16.199 --> 23:21.945
I mean, the largest of the commercial bookstores, the biggest Barnes and Nobles.

23:21.965 --> 23:22.345
Where are you?

23:22.425 --> 23:23.806
You're out in Western Mass?

23:23.826 --> 23:24.147
Central.

23:24.547 --> 23:24.987
Central Mass.

23:25.007 --> 23:32.134
There's a Barnes and Noble, I think one of the biggest ones that just opened out there in Holyoke, that has maybe...

23:32.857 --> 23:33.879
Probably has 80 to 100,000.

23:33.919 --> 23:38.045
They opened a huge one down at Framingham, which is huge.

23:38.366 --> 23:39.307
These huge bookstores.

23:39.347 --> 23:46.559
And I've argued, I've said in that book, that the emergence of these is one of the most interesting applications of digital technology in the practice of reading.

23:46.579 --> 23:48.402
But at the same time, 100,000 titles isn't a lot.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.345
Amazon.com on the web has a million.

23:50.665 --> 23:51.086
That's right.

23:51.106 --> 23:52.468
And that's probably the new way of...

23:52.448 --> 24:11.616
That's probably, but the problem is that on the one hand, you can, you know, over the web, you can get access, you can get huge numbers of these, particularly what's not represented in the Barnes and Nobles are the university press books, the small press books, the poetry books, all of the books at the margins of print practice and the same margins, the economic margins, not the cultural margins.

24:11.636 --> 24:15.942
And those are the books that we can now, again, I mean, those books have never been able to make it onto the bookshelves.

24:16.529 --> 24:21.395
But that we can either sell via the web or we can just distribute them.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.577
You should be able to walk into a Barnes & Noble.

24:23.597 --> 24:26.681
There should be a digital printer sitting in the middle of it or in a university bookstore.

24:27.182 --> 24:35.071
And again, you should be able to order a copy of any book in the University of California Press or a backlist, which should be infinite.

24:35.091 --> 24:39.416
I mean, there should be no reason for a book ever to come off backlist if it's just a digital representation.

24:39.436 --> 24:43.701
And just download it and print it and have it for...

24:43.900 --> 24:52.369
Probably we said $0.20 a page to digitize, but if you sell, you know, you can justify, that figure doesn't matter here.

24:52.389 --> 24:53.931
I mean, you should be able to have it for $20 or $30.

24:54.031 --> 24:55.452
Well, that's not bad.

24:55.713 --> 25:00.317
And that's, no, you won't have, you know, the paper won't be determined by the publisher.

25:00.337 --> 25:08.406
There'll be various shortcomings in the system, but as opposed to a system where these books can't make it onto, can't be advertised except by the very inefficient means of direct mail.

25:08.740 --> 25:16.329
which is terribly inefficient both in the sense that you don't reach most of your audience and that all of us receive dozens of these.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.671
I'm sure you receive many more than I do from every publisher.

25:18.691 --> 25:19.692
You receive these catalogs.

25:19.712 --> 25:21.014
They pile up in your bathroom.

25:21.134 --> 25:23.497
Just the catalogs are intimidating.

25:24.758 --> 25:26.340
Well, I write a weekly column.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.922
Right, okay.

25:28.042 --> 25:30.765
I do the language column at Fresh Air.

25:31.133 --> 25:31.714
Oh, really?

25:32.034 --> 25:35.199
So, you know, they send me all the language books.

25:35.219 --> 25:39.987
I mean, you go in their offices down there, you know, and Terry Gross gets these, you know, hundreds of these things a week.

25:40.007 --> 25:46.517
It's fun, but I mean, when you're a book nut, when you're a book nut like I am, it's like Christmas every day.

25:46.717 --> 25:46.837
Right.

25:47.078 --> 25:52.927
But, you know, the catalogs that you receive, for me, it's very inefficient as a means of buying books.

25:52.947 --> 25:55.531
First of all, because I don't get around to reading them.

25:55.551 --> 25:58.255
Second of all, because I don't get enough information about the books.

25:58.876 --> 26:00.880
to be able to make purchase decisions.

26:00.920 --> 26:10.319
If it isn't by a writer I know or whatever, you know, there's just a paragraph of prose you can't describe a book well enough to tell somebody if they want to buy it or not.

26:10.339 --> 26:18.235
Where by the web, as a friend of mine pointed out, you know, you give somebody a sample of, you go to Baskin-Robbins, you ask for a sample, they give you a tiny little plastic paper cup

26:18.991 --> 26:24.218
because if they give you half an ice cream cone, they're going to reduce your time for the other half.

26:24.398 --> 26:27.622
Places with informational products like books and records, they give them everything.

26:28.243 --> 26:37.755
I just called Microsoft the other day, and I asked if they have a demo on this new Word 97, because I've been a Word perfect guy, you know, and they said, well, no, just buy it, and if you don't like it, return it.

26:38.236 --> 26:39.538
That's a hell of a way to work.

26:39.558 --> 26:48.289
Or you can just, I mean, there are all these demos that expire, demos that miss, you know, here's our game missing all but the level five, you know, and up, and so on and so forth, or...

26:48.455 --> 27:16.875
Here's my new novel, you know, here's my new murder mystery, but I left out the last chapter. Right. There's lots of ways or you know, here's my new record, but in a degenerated uh you know not quite stereo quality audio, you know high audio quality. Now when I was out in San Francisco I guess this was September uh this Nicholson Baker thing was going. Right yeah. Do you have any any any comments on that? I think I mean my understanding is that you know as as well-meaning as he is um

27:16.973 --> 27:30.137
And I don't know whether there's any particular reason for getting rid of these catalogs if they cost money to maintain, but the cost of putting a book into circulation is just astounding if you look at what the library does.

27:30.598 --> 27:33.784
Even if somebody else is making the electronic catalog record,

27:34.237 --> 27:45.603
The cost of, you know, once the book comes in, of just getting it, getting things stamped in the back and, you know, the book stamped and so on and put on the shelves and the catalog entry made and so on, is something like $40 or $50 a book.

27:45.884 --> 27:52.279
This is an essay from somebody at the UC Press at the University of California office, the president.

27:52.698 --> 27:54.401
And it's just an astounding expenditure.

27:54.741 --> 28:02.995
And that's money that nobody wants to spend in the sense that it's not, it doesn't, you know, you would far rather reduce that cost and spend the money on books.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.298
That's the card catalog thing.

28:04.318 --> 28:08.685
But also he was talking about the books that were being, that were being quietly discarded.

28:08.705 --> 28:09.466
There's a lot of that.

28:09.486 --> 28:09.987
I mean, a lot.

28:10.208 --> 28:10.969
It may be true.

28:11.009 --> 28:11.951
There was just a survey.

28:11.971 --> 28:13.373
There was a study yesterday.

28:14.078 --> 28:18.225
That showed that an astoundingly... This was published yesterday?

28:18.425 --> 28:20.328
Yeah, this was just published in yesterday's Chrome.

28:20.348 --> 28:22.191
Oh, I'll go punch it up.

28:22.652 --> 28:29.143
And it showed that an astounding... How many of you found the book you were looking for?

28:29.684 --> 28:31.407
And that figure is usually around 70%.

28:31.707 --> 28:33.590
I can't remember the numbers now, so I'm guessing.

28:33.610 --> 28:37.937
But that figure is usually around 70% of people of the library patrons who find what they want.

28:37.957 --> 28:39.580
It was down like around 35%.

28:40.437 --> 28:42.960
It was an extraordinary reduction.

28:43.381 --> 28:48.868
Because books have been lost in transit or people can't find their way around the new library or whatever, I don't know.

28:48.888 --> 28:52.873
I do a lot of my research at the Athenaeum in Boston.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.056
It's extraordinary what they have.

28:55.076 --> 28:59.501
In principle, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

28:59.521 --> 29:01.183
I don't think you should mask them.

29:01.224 --> 29:02.745
I don't know what you do with them.

29:02.786 --> 29:06.310
But as I say, I don't think there's anything wrong with getting rid of

29:06.712 --> 29:11.178
the sorts of books that are very rarely accessed.

29:11.198 --> 29:18.909
Because, you know, probably if half the... And also the San Francisco Public Library is not a research library.

29:18.929 --> 29:20.471
It's got a million volumes, a million and a half volumes.

29:20.491 --> 29:22.614
It's too small to be a first-rate research library.

29:23.596 --> 29:26.500
I don't even think it pretends to be a research library.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.583
I don't think it pretends to be a research library.

29:28.603 --> 29:31.487
No, but most of the books that he was talking about were books...

29:32.176 --> 29:35.420
You know, I mean, they were travel guides from the 30s or whatever.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.524
I mean, they were books that you don't want to destroy, but on the other hand... Well, they had some antiquarian interest, I think.

29:39.744 --> 29:40.185
No, probably.

29:40.205 --> 29:44.750
I mean, any one of them does have antiquarian interest, but a collection of a library like that is going to be very spying.

29:44.770 --> 29:48.073
I mean, my sense is that... I don't know if they could get them over to Berkeley.

29:48.153 --> 29:49.575
I understand... Well, what was their question?

29:49.655 --> 29:54.080
They were resources to maintaining that part of their collections.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.803
They made themselves sitting ducks by dumping them.

29:57.123 --> 30:01.828
I mean, for one reason or another... What's his name, Kenneth?

30:02.213 --> 30:04.276
I don't know who you mean.

30:04.296 --> 30:04.636
Dowling?

30:04.676 --> 30:05.037
Dowling?

30:05.077 --> 30:07.019
Dowling, yeah, has made an idiot.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.622
I mean, there's also a budget crisis out here.

30:08.642 --> 30:09.443
He's gone.

30:10.344 --> 30:13.648
I mean, it's clear that in the spring he's going to be replaced.

30:13.708 --> 30:14.169
Is that right?

30:14.469 --> 30:21.098
Yeah, well, there's also, there was a budget shortfall, and then there was another budget shortfall, and the story about the catalogs and so on.

30:21.118 --> 30:21.899
I mean, there's a lot.

30:21.919 --> 30:23.601
There are reasons for getting rid of the catalogs.

30:23.742 --> 30:25.424
I understand why they want to get rid of the catalogs.

30:25.444 --> 30:26.866
Everybody's getting rid of the catalogs.

30:26.886 --> 30:28.528
I mean, it's just not a very efficient way.

30:28.548 --> 30:29.630
You lose the cards.

30:29.870 --> 30:30.010
Mm-hmm.

30:30.530 --> 30:31.291
And they're terrible.

30:31.311 --> 30:34.836
I mean, you know, you can fetishize them all you want, but they're terrible.

30:34.976 --> 30:35.797
I mean, I hate cattle.

30:35.817 --> 30:36.478
I mean, they're gone.

30:36.498 --> 30:37.419
They're gone at Harvard.

30:37.640 --> 30:41.044
They're pulling out those damn boxes and going through the things and writing down little slips.

30:41.064 --> 30:43.007
What an awful way to spend your time.

30:43.027 --> 30:48.354
I think we're taking our eye off the ball if we get mired in that regular aspect of the thing.

30:48.795 --> 30:51.118
And I do at some point, let me know when you have to run.

30:52.119 --> 30:58.528
So the point I was making about the web sale of books is that the technologies...

30:59.757 --> 31:04.262
and this is a point I made in that article in this book, the technologies really enhance the role of the printed book.

31:04.282 --> 31:20.901
They enhance the role of the printed book, first of all, by making publicity in the 18th century sense much easier and much more efficient, particularly for the kinds of books that have always had trouble getting onto bookstore shelves and into bestseller lists and book reviews and so on.

31:21.883 --> 31:28.330
And on the other hand, they make the distribution of these books much more efficient by permitting...
