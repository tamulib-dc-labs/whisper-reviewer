WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:09.510
What I was just going to say is that I'm not a collector at all, but love living with this collection.

00:09.530 --> 00:19.825
It's a great pleasure, and have always had a bargain with them, particularly when we were in the other apartment, which was just inundated with books, because this is just a small portion of his book collection.

00:20.186 --> 00:30.441
And we had, I think, 60,000 to 70,000 books in the other apartment, so I just said, as long as we kept my side of the bed clear, that was okay, because there literally were piles of books everywhere.

00:30.481 --> 00:31.523
I mean, they took on...

00:31.992 --> 00:37.157
human dimensions or living dimensions, and that was quite something.

00:37.337 --> 00:39.659
Now, you're a therapist, I understand.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.282
Do you have an evaluation of this phenomenon?

00:44.083 --> 00:49.048
And I'm not asking for a really serious evaluation.

00:49.068 --> 00:49.949
Nothing in particular.

00:49.989 --> 00:54.433
I mean, I think that he just has such an eye.

00:54.753 --> 00:55.674
I have a couple of thoughts.

00:55.694 --> 01:00.278
I mean, I think he has an extraordinary eye and loves interesting, quirky, beautiful

01:00.629 --> 01:02.691
and loves putting things together.

01:02.751 --> 01:07.196
And I think he's been that way since he was a kid, to see that with the soldiers.

01:07.216 --> 01:25.095
And, you know, it has at times gotten out of hand, which the book collection did, because there's no way, once you decide that you're going to collect 20th century fiction and go for every author, you know, he kept, he would say, I'm not going to collect that author.

01:25.135 --> 01:29.320
And then he'd read a good review by a new author and a first nominee and say, well, I've got to add that one.

01:29.654 --> 01:38.304
So I think that got out of hand, and it was a blessing to have moved, because by this apartment smaller, and we were limited because of that.

01:38.644 --> 01:42.148
Did you influence that in any kind of subtle way, would you say?

01:42.388 --> 01:42.889
The move?

01:42.909 --> 01:43.189
Yeah.

01:43.430 --> 01:44.331
Oh, major way.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.753
I really wanted to move.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.275
I also wanted to be near the park.

01:48.295 --> 01:49.076
I see.

01:49.096 --> 01:54.362
So it wasn't really a way of cutting down on the collecting in any way.

01:54.848 --> 01:59.452
That wasn't in mine, but I mean, that really wasn't.

01:59.472 --> 02:00.333
It's a happy concept.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.354
It's a happy concept.

02:01.474 --> 02:04.778
We knew there was no way, you know, we were going to move.

02:04.838 --> 02:05.778
We wanted something smaller.

02:05.798 --> 02:07.440
That was an apartment with seven bedrooms.

02:08.241 --> 02:10.763
And we knew that we wanted something much smaller.

02:11.023 --> 02:15.328
And we also had always wanted a living room that was a library.

02:16.188 --> 02:17.370
And so we could live with the books.

02:17.750 --> 02:24.096
We didn't have, the books were, you know, in every hallway and in the kitchen.

02:24.346 --> 02:24.967
Paul.

02:25.087 --> 02:26.269
Did he know where everything was?

02:26.610 --> 02:28.292
He knows where everything is.

02:28.312 --> 02:29.614
He has always known where everything is.

02:29.674 --> 02:37.326
If you came in and moved anything, he would be able to say, my God, what happened to this such and such?

02:37.346 --> 02:38.368
He knows where everything is.

02:38.488 --> 02:43.596
My wife loaned a book of short stories, she was straight to her mother.

02:43.837 --> 02:44.598
And then no problem.

02:44.618 --> 02:49.385
But I said, have you seen my, you know, of course, I don't believe it.

02:49.405 --> 02:49.746
It was.

02:49.912 --> 02:50.993
Because I'm double-shelved.

02:51.013 --> 02:52.355
I have books in front of them back.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.297
Yeah, so are a lot of these.

02:54.317 --> 02:56.098
How did you know it was wrong?

02:56.659 --> 02:59.923
There's a great quote I use in the book, in my book.

03:00.163 --> 03:04.567
Somebody asked Charles Lamb, you know, how can he possibly know what he has?

03:04.587 --> 03:06.189
And he says, how does a shepherd know his sheep?

03:07.070 --> 03:07.711
That's wonderful.

03:07.731 --> 03:10.774
I mean, he was very anxious about making a move.

03:10.834 --> 03:16.400
He had been in that apartment for 24 years, 23 years, and I was there for 19 years.

03:17.541 --> 03:19.463
Much longer time than any of us have ever lived.

03:20.337 --> 03:37.279
either of us have ever moved any place, and he was, he, I don't think he would have moved had I not really wanted to move, and had, you know, he, he was very anxious about it, and because it seemed so daunting, how do you move 70,000 books, and how do you, you know, begin to, Now, did he supervise this?

03:37.299 --> 03:38.921
Clearly, he must have had people.

03:38.941 --> 03:49.855
He has always, the book collection, and I don't know if you know this, but it was, he did it all, it was not, he resisted computer, computerizing it for years, so he did it, yeah, now it is, but,

03:50.071 --> 03:58.263
So he did it all on yellow pads to begin with, and then finally had a notebook where he did all the cataloging.

03:58.723 --> 04:01.327
He now had someone, you know, who works on... Have you met Richard?

04:01.748 --> 04:02.729
No.

04:02.749 --> 04:06.715
Somebody who works on the collection, but for the first couple of years, he did it all.

04:07.336 --> 04:10.681
And, you know, it was painstaking and timely.

04:10.741 --> 04:15.808
But moving... No, there was a huge crew to move...

04:16.058 --> 04:18.201
Is it pretty much Catala?

04:18.261 --> 04:19.363
I'll have to ask him that.

04:19.383 --> 04:20.084
It's alphabetical.

04:20.204 --> 04:21.567
Oh, it is alphabetical.

04:21.787 --> 04:29.779
There's some bound books on the top that have nothing to do with the collection on the top of the shelf, but it starts with Agee, and it goes around the room.

04:29.799 --> 04:30.781
Oh, so it's pretty systematic.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.385
Oh, yeah, and then it's finished.

04:33.485 --> 04:34.827
I think it goes to...

04:36.258 --> 05:05.860
uh okay yeah soon um you must have you do a wealthy here so then well no that goes into the living there's another library so the rest of tea through um now he said these boxes made everywhere yeah those have all been made and he does all you know he would sit for hours on end with the glycine or whatever glassine or whatever it's called and do all the coverings himself one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten ten

05:06.430 --> 05:31.408
yeah yeah so he he knows where everything is he knows um what everything is we don't read these books i mean for you to you're what if i had given a you know book of cheaper short stories to um somebody he would have had a fit yeah he doesn't we don't really read them but we'll what we'll do is there'll be people here talking and we'll have the kids here and

05:31.810 --> 05:36.934
talking about Sylvia Plath or something, and then he'll pull things out and we'll read the letters.

05:37.655 --> 05:38.456
He'll read the letters?

05:38.616 --> 05:40.017
No, we all will.

05:40.077 --> 05:47.723
He's not protective like that, but he doesn't want them read, you know, just sitting with dog-eared and etc.

05:47.844 --> 05:52.508
So he's careful about that, but loves that people are interested.

05:52.588 --> 05:55.970
And there's so few people who really are.

05:55.990 --> 05:58.392
I've found this everywhere I go.

05:58.953 --> 06:01.395
It's such a phenomenal thing, so unless you

06:01.696 --> 06:06.265
And he was thrilled with that when someone really understands what he's done.

06:06.565 --> 06:07.347
I've got Mark.

06:09.010 --> 06:13.599
Me, Catherine, went out to put in school with the book collection growing like crazy.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.143
His room was covered with bookcases.

06:16.304 --> 06:18.608
So he came home to find his room.

06:19.685 --> 06:23.850
intact, but with, you know, thousands of books.

06:23.930 --> 06:25.312
He was 15, this is young Carter.

06:25.332 --> 06:28.796
He was 15, and to this day is offended by that.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.519
And I was offended by that.

06:31.059 --> 06:35.505
Carter was really stubborn about that one, because he wanted that space, and I thought that was awful.

06:36.666 --> 06:41.252
But that's the, it's never, other than that, it's never bothered me very much.

06:41.272 --> 06:45.878
Also, the other thing, when the collection was growing at its fastest,

06:46.263 --> 07:12.034
there was one room sort of the receiving room where they would come and we would sometimes come back for a weekend and that room would be filled with 60 cartons that he had to open and you know how books get those little silver well i don't know where she said i don't know okay okay i'm just gonna look okay as you can see it starts alphabetically um

07:12.824 --> 07:17.912
in the river house, I had it served by categories, but I'm rather pleased that it is health medical.

07:17.932 --> 07:28.788
So starting with A, working the way we get to back to part of S here, and then a complete.

07:29.289 --> 07:31.192
Actually, you have a wrap over there, too, I noticed.

07:32.674 --> 07:33.755
Right.

07:33.775 --> 07:33.996
Hi, Mark.

07:34.016 --> 07:34.597
How are you?

07:34.617 --> 07:35.077
How are you?

07:35.638 --> 07:35.738
Good.

07:35.758 --> 07:36.139
You are?

07:37.181 --> 07:38.983
How are you?

07:39.003 --> 07:39.083
Hey.

07:39.103 --> 07:40.806
This is wonderful coming here.

07:41.157 --> 07:42.700
And books are everywhere, right?

07:42.720 --> 07:45.164
I assume they are.

07:45.184 --> 07:51.134
And then it starts again, but it has to continue, and then all the way around ends up over there.

07:51.154 --> 07:55.522
I think you said the last time there were about 15,000 books here.

07:56.965 --> 07:59.649
And so, therefore, the remainder is in storage?

08:00.190 --> 08:03.135
Yeah, I am not sure whether it really is 15,000.

08:03.175 --> 08:04.077
We just...

08:05.204 --> 08:13.092
I'm working on an inventory to catalog them somewhat more efficiently.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.736
I think it's more like 12, probably.

08:16.756 --> 08:18.658
So there are perhaps 30 or 45,000 elsewhere.

08:18.818 --> 08:20.260
Yeah, there are.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.582
So is this the cream of the collection?

08:22.602 --> 08:24.063
This is the cream of the collection.

08:24.083 --> 08:31.431
These are the people that I want to continue with and add to and so forth.

08:31.934 --> 08:34.978
Timothy Williams Street kind of desire.

08:34.998 --> 08:36.059
It's a gorgeous rapper.

08:37.161 --> 08:37.541
I'm sorry.

08:39.223 --> 08:46.172
And some of the secondary titles, say, for Williams and so forth, I have to keep in storage.

08:47.574 --> 08:50.217
Now, when you say storage, are they accessible to you?

08:50.757 --> 08:51.779
Yeah, they're accessible.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.660
They are accessible.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.944
I mean, it's not like they're in trunks that you can't... No, they're accessible.

08:56.024 --> 08:57.606
It's very expensive, however.

08:57.626 --> 09:00.810
I've got to try and find a better way to do it.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.375
Are you comfortable with the reduced number?

09:05.856 --> 09:06.256
Oh, yeah.

09:06.957 --> 09:10.140
You were, at one point, working on approximately 6,000 office.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.662
What would you say the number is now?

09:12.703 --> 09:15.325
Should it come down that way?

09:15.405 --> 09:20.471
What, roughly, I mean, isn't that good?

09:20.491 --> 09:21.131
500, maybe?

09:21.231 --> 09:21.572
Really?

09:22.392 --> 09:23.674
No, I don't think it comes, no.

09:24.775 --> 09:28.899
Boy, does that mean, have you deaccessioned, shall we say, the other 5,500?

09:29.039 --> 09:31.141
Well, I'm trying to figure out what to do with them.

09:31.221 --> 09:31.722
You still have them.

09:31.742 --> 09:32.923
Yeah, I still have them.

09:33.629 --> 09:36.293
But they are no longer being actively collected.

09:37.474 --> 09:39.317
Right, right, exactly.

09:39.577 --> 09:45.926
Peter Howard, when I interviewed him, suggested that your premise, which was bold and wonderful.

09:46.947 --> 09:48.970
Very lucrative.

09:49.310 --> 09:52.455
I put a quote on it.

09:52.475 --> 09:53.076
Where was I?

09:54.277 --> 10:00.666
He said that he thought your premise was to pick up where Barrett,

10:00.967 --> 10:25.793
left off to try and do the same thing right and that's pretty interesting and i've since researched barrett pretty thoroughly you've obviously know more than i do yeah i'll send you some stuff when it was fascinating yeah virginia sent me a wonderful he really was um i mean comprehensive wasn't it i mean well kind of what you're doing i mean they really are it's right i don't know the story about him buying a

10:26.498 --> 10:29.482
whole duplicate Frost collection just to get the first book, right?

10:29.782 --> 10:33.687
Yeah, well, you bought Hike and the Airplane to get the DJ.

10:33.707 --> 10:34.969
Right.

10:35.329 --> 10:39.034
That didn't blow me off the line.

10:39.935 --> 10:42.218
You have two Ann Tyler first books there.

10:42.979 --> 10:50.068
You know, they're probably all variants, or they're both inscribed or whatever.

10:50.088 --> 10:51.529
Let me go talk to Mark.

10:51.630 --> 10:53.552
Okay.

10:53.802 --> 10:58.288
Father Fly died, you know.

10:58.308 --> 10:58.709
Oh, yes.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.611
His copy, so I've got a couple of books.

11:00.752 --> 11:01.673
Oh, that's nice.

11:01.973 --> 11:03.736
Yeah, which is very nice.

11:03.756 --> 11:04.717
So you're still collecting.

11:04.857 --> 11:05.518
Oh, yeah.

11:05.538 --> 11:06.900
Oh, yeah.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.245
I bought something from Peter's podcast.

11:10.285 --> 11:12.528
Oh, I interviewed Carl Peterson.

11:12.548 --> 11:12.688
Mm-hmm.

11:13.158 --> 11:13.899
He's in my book.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.282
Actually, everything is just about written.

11:16.362 --> 11:17.083
It's very close.

11:17.123 --> 11:18.044
It's getting very close.

11:18.064 --> 11:20.226
Oh, that's right.

11:20.707 --> 11:22.069
What was I going to ask you?

11:22.089 --> 11:23.350
I think it's got a million questions.

11:23.590 --> 11:24.972
I really won't be here long.

11:24.992 --> 11:25.873
I really wanted to come.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.034
Oh, I wanted to see.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.536
Is it basically these two roles?

11:28.556 --> 11:29.077
That's it, yeah.

11:29.718 --> 11:30.198
All right.

11:30.579 --> 11:41.832
Quick question, and you don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but Peter had mentioned to me, and somebody else had mentioned that when Margie Cohn had more or less introduced you to the book world,

11:42.487 --> 11:43.689
and she showed you around.

11:44.350 --> 11:47.776
Did you know that she put like a 10% commission on the internet?

11:47.816 --> 11:48.397
I learned that.

11:49.018 --> 11:53.305
I learned that after about six months to my horror, and I stopped.

11:53.325 --> 11:54.387
I never went back to her.

11:54.827 --> 11:54.967
Yeah.

11:56.049 --> 12:03.922
One guy told me, and I won't tell you his name, but I looked at my transcript, and Peter absolutely said it.

12:04.723 --> 12:08.730
Apparently, she took you around on her arm, and she basically said,

12:09.082 --> 12:10.144
No question about it.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.188
This is mine, and it's 10%.

12:12.208 --> 12:19.282
And people, this one guy, said that we were required to give her 10%.

12:19.302 --> 12:21.787
And I just wondered if, I don't know what it is.

12:21.807 --> 12:22.369
It's actually true.

12:22.449 --> 12:23.691
I'd like to report it, actually.

12:24.072 --> 12:24.994
I'm all for it.

12:25.014 --> 12:25.675
You can quote me.

12:25.755 --> 12:26.216
Do you mind?

12:26.497 --> 12:29.082
Not at all, because I'm still pissed off about it, frankly.

12:29.568 --> 12:56.318
and um when i confronted her about it oh well that's the way goodwin i did it with you know goodwin who's goodwin uh remember the goodwin sale and it was about 77 here in america well carl peterson you know swore by her yeah good for you i didn't think that you'd want me to report that i've been

12:56.804 --> 12:59.707
looking for somebody to make that point.

12:59.747 --> 13:03.530
Well, I'm trying to do more than just a little superficial recording about the beautiful books.

13:03.610 --> 13:07.694
I'm trying to give somebody the dynamic of the book trade.

13:07.814 --> 13:16.362
And now Peter did also say, I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase before, and he spoke rapturously about the Carter-Burden phenomenon.

13:16.402 --> 13:17.463
Have you ever heard that phrase?

13:17.483 --> 13:17.663
No.

13:18.144 --> 13:18.885
So that's new to you.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.006
That's new to me.

13:20.046 --> 13:23.569
Well, you can read about it in my book, and I won't have to ask you about it.

13:23.589 --> 13:25.731
But he basically said that you energized

13:26.605 --> 13:27.827
I guess I could ask you this.

13:28.088 --> 13:35.541
Do you feel that you in any way brought modern first editions up to a higher level than perhaps it had been prior to that?

13:35.561 --> 13:38.487
Because you really could have collected anything else.

13:38.507 --> 13:48.525
Well, I think it's just an indication of how unpopular the field is, frankly.

13:48.545 --> 13:50.689
I mean, this is a period when people, you know,

13:50.838 --> 13:56.744
Well, our popular fine arts were going up in value enormously and so forth, and huge amounts of money were being spent.

13:57.705 --> 14:05.312
And I think, you know, books here go void as a kind of speculative fever.

14:05.792 --> 14:06.593
It was possible.

14:07.134 --> 14:12.139
Although you look at Manny was an ample of... I should have brought the Manny stuff up.

14:12.159 --> 14:14.000
It really goes down to bankruptcy.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.242
Really?

14:15.762 --> 14:16.903
Yeah.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.866
Let's say Bradley Martin sold for $39 million.

14:20.622 --> 14:24.806
If that had gone to the heirs, what would they have had to pay for taxes?

14:24.826 --> 14:25.587
$35 million.

14:25.607 --> 14:28.390
60% of the, let's say, $40 million.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.791
So the figure is 60%.

14:29.831 --> 14:30.632
60%, absolutely.

14:30.652 --> 14:35.037
Because we were talking about that, why it's impossible to... They would have had to come up.

14:35.457 --> 14:42.444
Now, probably for estate purposes, they would have valued it at less than $39 million, I would imagine.

14:42.484 --> 14:43.846
$35, I think, is what they got.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.427
Yeah, just 60%.

14:45.868 --> 14:48.210
They'd have to come up with 60% in cash to keep it.

14:48.230 --> 14:48.891
That's a lot of money.

14:49.428 --> 14:51.551
regardless of how much that you might have.

14:51.731 --> 14:52.051
Exactly.

14:52.151 --> 14:58.679
And so we figured Scheide's library is worth anywhere from 50 to 100 million dollars.

14:58.699 --> 15:00.522
He's got two Gutenberg Bibles now.

15:00.542 --> 15:04.567
And, you know, he brought... Terrific.

15:04.627 --> 15:06.669
That's really nice.

15:06.689 --> 15:12.957
I guess the only person he really stopped was Houghton, for whatever reason.

15:12.977 --> 15:14.038
He's still alive, right?

15:14.058 --> 15:14.539
No, he died.

15:15.039 --> 15:15.500
Did he die?

15:15.560 --> 15:16.081
Yeah, he died.

15:16.101 --> 15:17.522
In fact, you know who knew him very well?

15:17.723 --> 15:17.983
Who?

15:18.436 --> 15:20.479
I talked to him as James Michener.

15:21.139 --> 15:21.300
Oh.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.904
Jim Michener gave me some very good insights about it.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.125
The feeling was with Houghton.

15:27.107 --> 15:28.689
Did I have anything else I wanted to ask you?

15:29.029 --> 15:29.910
What's your favorite thing?

15:29.990 --> 15:31.552
Can you show me a favorite thing?

15:32.033 --> 15:32.834
A favorite thing.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.717
Okay.

15:35.737 --> 15:36.138
Hold on.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.601
Favorite thing.

15:38.621 --> 15:39.322
Do you mean a book?

15:39.702 --> 15:40.063
Something.

15:43.287 --> 15:45.309
Why don't I show you these?

15:45.509 --> 15:46.030
Probably more historical.

15:47.933 --> 15:50.296
Are you happy here?

15:50.476 --> 15:51.757
Right across from the Met?

15:51.837 --> 15:53.259
I didn't realize it until I got here.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.423
It's so nice to have everything, you know, to be able to get it, say anything.

15:56.543 --> 16:00.107
And by the way, I'm just going to say Upper West Side.

16:00.247 --> 16:01.388
Yeah, okay.

16:01.508 --> 16:02.229
That would be great.

16:03.070 --> 16:04.912
No different from what they did in the Vogue piece.

16:06.494 --> 16:10.999
And you don't mind if I report in my book that that Vogue spread was this place?

16:11.299 --> 16:12.360
No, go ahead.

16:12.441 --> 16:14.643
Absolutely.

16:14.803 --> 16:16.405
These are...

16:17.043 --> 16:25.233
These are a collection of about 120 letters.

16:30.779 --> 16:31.700
Ralph had them?

16:32.001 --> 16:32.942
Ralph had them, yeah.

16:33.783 --> 16:37.427
So these are really, those are hers, but then should we have these treated?

16:38.488 --> 16:41.292
I probably should, no.

16:41.452 --> 16:43.354
It certainly does.

16:43.891 --> 16:45.012
But they're all very chatty.

16:45.032 --> 16:47.715
I mean, it's extraordinary for a writer that nobody knows anything about.

16:49.037 --> 16:51.459
You can, one, trace his, where he was.

16:52.020 --> 16:52.961
They're all very chatty.

16:52.981 --> 16:57.706
They're all about what he was doing, their responses.

16:57.726 --> 16:58.187
That's great.

16:58.627 --> 16:59.328
Isn't that great?

16:59.348 --> 17:00.609
Yeah, that's great.

17:00.629 --> 17:03.112
Yeah.

17:03.132 --> 17:06.456
One doesn't want to ask why the agent sold them, I suppose.

17:06.496 --> 17:07.176
He dropped her.

17:07.757 --> 17:07.857
Yeah.

17:08.866 --> 17:13.010
I see you can't publish these though, right?

17:13.030 --> 17:14.291
No, no, no.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.554
Do you have the Ian Hamilton proof?

17:17.895 --> 17:18.435
Yeah, I do.

17:19.076 --> 17:19.536
I do.

17:19.556 --> 17:21.318
Can I ask, just curious what you pay for that?

17:21.418 --> 17:21.839
Oh, nothing.

17:21.919 --> 17:24.922
I bought it for, I don't know, $35 because I bought it early.

17:25.382 --> 17:25.802
Wow.

17:26.863 --> 17:27.404
What is it worth?

17:27.564 --> 17:28.085
Oh, big.

17:28.765 --> 17:29.846
I couldn't say, $500 maybe?

17:30.107 --> 17:30.407
Yeah.

17:30.707 --> 17:31.388
It has to be.

17:31.908 --> 17:33.130
Yeah.

17:33.150 --> 17:36.713
Well, because the book was censored at the end of the book.

17:37.688 --> 17:46.078
This is to his elder at the New Yorker, Gus Lebrano.

17:46.779 --> 17:48.942
Why don't you tell me what we've got here.

17:49.302 --> 18:04.000
He was the only known first, the first English, with a, with, you know, a,

18:04.250 --> 18:06.553
inscription of this length to his editor.

18:06.673 --> 18:09.576
We won't read it, but it's dated July 1851.

18:09.596 --> 18:16.604
And it says, Dear Gus, and it's signed... Jerry.

18:17.045 --> 18:20.269
Dear Gus, this is the first catcher in the rye I've ever inscribed.

18:21.690 --> 18:23.793
It couldn't possibly go to anyone but you.

18:24.974 --> 18:27.937
That isn't even nearly all I want to say.

18:27.997 --> 18:31.101
Your advice counted so much while I was writing the book.

18:31.570 --> 18:38.301
It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway, that I'd rather have your approval of my work than anybody else's.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.567
I wish everybody knew what an artist you are.

18:41.607 --> 18:45.333
One last thing, if you can bear it.

18:46.155 --> 18:54.068
If I were Holden's brother, I would write across the flyleaf of his address book, Please Call Gus Lebrano.

18:54.773 --> 18:57.355
with worlds of affection, Jerry.

18:57.556 --> 18:59.157
L-O, L-O, or L-A?

18:59.177 --> 19:00.358
L-O, maybe.

19:00.378 --> 19:01.819
L-O-B-R-A-N-O.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.241
L-O-B-R-A-N-O.

19:03.401 --> 19:08.145
He was a famous editor of New York.

19:08.165 --> 19:09.927
Now, I can assure you, I won't quote that.

19:10.047 --> 19:10.387
Yeah.

19:10.447 --> 19:11.749
Because I'd have trouble from selling it.

19:11.769 --> 19:12.449
You would, right?

19:12.469 --> 19:13.030
That's right.

19:13.050 --> 19:17.714
What I'm going to say is, what is apparently the first inscribed book?

19:17.734 --> 19:18.595
As long as you don't quote it.

19:18.675 --> 19:18.955
Yeah.

19:19.416 --> 19:20.116
Is that what it means?

19:20.136 --> 19:21.638
Even an inscription in a book?

19:21.738 --> 19:21.838
Yeah.

19:21.858 --> 19:22.939
The copyright's here?

19:22.959 --> 19:23.059
Yeah.

19:23.613 --> 19:26.918
Oh, that was what the case was all about.

19:26.938 --> 19:27.158
Oh, my God.

19:27.178 --> 19:29.882
That's what that whole case was about.

19:29.902 --> 19:33.287
Let me just check my notes here.

19:37.313 --> 19:37.894
What other thing?

19:37.914 --> 19:45.085
You saw that biography by, what's his name, about the Paley's, not the Paley's, the sisters.

19:45.806 --> 19:46.667
Oh, yeah.

19:46.848 --> 19:48.230
And did you read it?

19:48.250 --> 19:49.632
I didn't really read it.

19:49.652 --> 19:51.915
And they said when you were in politics,

19:52.199 --> 19:57.445
I'm just wondering if Grafton's getting a little hyperbolic, that the White House was just around the corner.

19:58.145 --> 20:00.668
Please, I mean, I was in city council for a second.

20:00.688 --> 20:04.372
Did you ever have any, I mean, did you ever, honestly, ever have any aspirations to it?

20:04.392 --> 20:04.572
No.

20:04.592 --> 20:05.493
So that's foolish.

20:05.514 --> 20:06.014
Yeah, that's foolish.

20:06.034 --> 20:09.137
So it would be foolish of me to repeat that quote.

20:09.157 --> 20:10.038
Yes, I hope so.

20:10.058 --> 20:11.480
I'm just trying to be, you know.

20:11.820 --> 20:12.361
Yeah, yeah.

20:12.381 --> 20:13.522
I mean, it's absurd, you know.

20:14.023 --> 20:15.945
That was press.

20:16.586 --> 20:18.848
It seems, I said, how could they possibly...

20:19.267 --> 20:23.492
Yeah, I was running for the city council of New York, for God's sake.

20:23.512 --> 20:24.053
Okay.

20:26.035 --> 20:29.339
What's your Updike collection up to now with all those things?

20:31.161 --> 20:31.341
Oh, God.

20:31.361 --> 20:32.262
The sign limited.

20:33.624 --> 20:36.507
You and I had a discussion about that.

20:37.508 --> 20:37.908
Yeah.

20:37.928 --> 20:43.014
And I think that you admitted that if you had it to do all over again, you'd never get into that stuff.

20:43.074 --> 20:43.575
Maybe not.

20:43.595 --> 20:44.176
I don't know.

20:44.196 --> 20:45.517
Yeah, except Updike is so good.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.819
I mean, I admire him so much.

20:47.079 --> 20:47.940
Updike is the exception.

20:48.005 --> 20:50.111
Uptake's an exception.

20:50.131 --> 20:50.693
More than 500?

20:50.733 --> 20:51.536
Oh, yeah.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.120
Do you have everything, do you think?

20:53.140 --> 20:54.665
I don't even know what I've got.

20:54.705 --> 20:55.046
Everything.

20:56.210 --> 20:57.774
There's a guy out in Western Mass.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.078
I mean, things keep turning up.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.368
Okay.
