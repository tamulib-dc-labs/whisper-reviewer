WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:05.460
I'm just taping this now, L.D., just to see how we pick up.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.606
I just want to just say something.

00:07.626 --> 00:07.907
All right.

00:07.927 --> 00:10.334
I'll repeat that I'm so happy you're here today, Nick.

00:10.815 --> 00:12.480
I've been looking forward to your visit a lot.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.185
Why don't I just say that we're with L.D.

00:14.225 --> 00:14.706
Brodsky.

00:14.726 --> 00:15.087
We're...

00:15.269 --> 00:16.150
in his car.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.191
We're on Interstate.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.433
Are we on an Interstate?

00:18.453 --> 00:23.278
On Interstate 40, going to 270, getting ready to head southeast to Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

00:23.318 --> 00:24.860
Cape Girardeau.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.784
For the benefit of my typist, how do we spell that?

00:29.645 --> 00:29.926
Cape.

00:29.986 --> 00:34.070
C-A-P-E-G-I-R-A-R-D-E-A-U, and it's 10-3.

00:34.331 --> 00:36.173
Okay, thank you.

00:36.253 --> 00:41.579
We're on LD, and I'm just going to keep this close to you because what you have to say is most important.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.561
Where do you want to start?

00:43.581 --> 00:44.262
Let's see started.

00:44.422 --> 00:45.023
How old are you?

00:45.509 --> 00:46.530
I'm almost 50.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.651
I'll be 50 in April.

00:48.012 --> 00:54.479
And I started collecting books when I was at Yale as a freshman or a sophomore.

00:54.519 --> 00:57.002
I almost can't remember anymore, but I was probably 19.

00:57.723 --> 00:58.924
And I went to Yale in 1959.

00:59.044 --> 01:00.947
I think I started collecting in 60.

01:02.048 --> 01:03.510
And that was real haphazard.

01:05.492 --> 01:12.039
There was a wonderful book dealer named Henry Wenning in New Haven, and he was on my way to the Payne Whitney Gymnasium.

01:12.099 --> 01:14.402
I was on the Yale crew, freshman and then varsity.

01:14.973 --> 01:16.515
And so I would work out every day.

01:16.575 --> 01:26.728
And on my way from my dormitory or college to the gym, I would stop by Henry's shop.

01:26.868 --> 01:30.673
I wandered in there because I was learning something about literature.

01:30.693 --> 01:35.459
And he had the most wonderful shelves full of books that just made me awe-filled.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.463
I would see copies of Moby Dick.

01:38.803 --> 01:41.006
I think the book is called The Whale.

01:41.026 --> 01:43.950
And then I would see inscribed books

01:44.403 --> 01:50.352
that I liked, such as Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie, which even as a young man I was very much in love with.

01:50.992 --> 01:55.739
I loved Main Street and Babbitt by Sinclair Lewis, and there were inscribed copies of those books.

01:55.919 --> 01:56.961
You just wanted to see these?

01:56.981 --> 01:57.682
Yeah, I'd go in.

01:57.702 --> 02:01.387
Well, I wandered in by accident one day because it said Henry Wenning Bookshop.

02:02.429 --> 02:08.157
And I probably thought it was just another bookshop where I could buy my school books.

02:08.517 --> 02:09.619
I don't know how it happened.

02:09.639 --> 02:10.861
I was not a bibliophile.

02:11.582 --> 02:13.785
But then when I got in there, I was so in awe

02:13.934 --> 02:30.745
of the books that i had been reading as a freshman and sophomore that i was really uh first introduced to at yale not in high school even though i went to a really fine prep school uh st louis country day school here which is still just an outstanding school one of the tenth

02:30.725 --> 02:31.787
Best in the country.

02:31.887 --> 02:34.471
It's every bit the equivalent of Andover and Exeter.

02:34.911 --> 02:37.575
So, no, I thought I was well prepared to go to college.

02:38.176 --> 02:42.823
I had never read any Faulkner, had never read any Sinclair Lewis or Dreiser.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.208
A kid really does, kids generally don't come to Faulkner.

02:46.288 --> 02:49.493
No, but now in high schools they're teaching a lot of Faulkner.

02:49.513 --> 02:51.636
You almost can't go to a high school anymore.

02:51.616 --> 02:55.681
without seeing that on their curriculum they're teaching the bear at least.

02:56.362 --> 03:02.370
Sometimes The Unvanquished is taught because people think that's an easy novel and it's really not an easy novel at all.

03:02.690 --> 03:07.116
I'd have expected it to get started with Thomas Wolfe.

03:07.136 --> 03:14.485
When you go back to Thomas Wolfe, what were we so excited about when we read him?

03:15.207 --> 03:17.431
I loved it.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.977
I remember I was introduced to Look Homeward Angel.

03:20.418 --> 03:22.842
At the same time, I was introduced to The Sound and the Fury.

03:23.584 --> 03:26.710
And the one remained extremely memorable.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.496
It resonated right away for me, which was The Sound and the Fury.

03:29.516 --> 03:35.528
But Look Homeward Angel, which I found very elegiac, very melodious, even as a young man,

03:35.913 --> 03:39.802
And I wouldn't have used those terms then because I wouldn't have responded to those books that way.

03:39.842 --> 03:44.011
But even then, I wasn't turned on to Wolfe.

03:44.031 --> 03:44.933
And I'm not sure why.

03:44.953 --> 03:47.258
I've never really returned to Thomas Wolfe.

03:47.298 --> 03:51.507
But all these years, I've continued to reread Falker with great, great pleasure.

03:51.527 --> 03:53.652
Well, Falker has layers that...

03:54.340 --> 03:55.501
There's always something new.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.304
It's like Shakespeare, you know.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.525
Well, I'll tell you what happened to me.

03:58.545 --> 03:59.446
Or Melville even.

03:59.466 --> 04:01.849
I mean, there's always a new layer.

04:02.049 --> 04:03.291
Wonderful layers.

04:03.311 --> 04:12.562
But now as a person who has been a poet for 25 years and who considers himself a ruminative person, I've had much time to think about all that.

04:13.062 --> 04:18.989
And what I think now is that the reason I was drawn to Faulkner, and most specifically to The Sound and the Fury, which R.W.B.

04:19.049 --> 04:23.875
Lewis taught in his introductory English class, which is where I first read that book,

04:24.209 --> 04:26.753
Why I was drawn to that book was this.

04:28.496 --> 04:33.283
I was Quentin Compson, the young little brooding guy.

04:33.303 --> 04:37.350
And in essence, though, I wouldn't have known it then, the guy from the South.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.513
Because though I would never have dreamed of it, St.

04:39.533 --> 04:41.256
Louis is Southern.

04:42.113 --> 04:42.473
St.

04:42.513 --> 04:46.217
Louisans to this day don't know they're southern here, so they have no sense of place.

04:46.237 --> 04:46.998
It's really weird.

04:47.378 --> 04:51.743
I could take you 250 miles down the road to Memphis, and they damn well know they're southern.

04:51.763 --> 04:53.504
This is Memphis what, by the way?

04:53.624 --> 04:53.985
Tennessee.

04:54.005 --> 04:55.046
That's as close as we are now?

04:55.066 --> 04:55.907
We're that close.

04:55.927 --> 04:57.408
We could be down there in five hours.

04:57.628 --> 04:58.269
No kidding.

04:58.289 --> 05:00.732
I never knew that growing up here, that we were so close.

05:00.832 --> 05:08.279
We could drive you just south of Cape Girardeau, where I'm going today, and you'll see cotton growing 20 miles south of Cape.

05:08.719 --> 05:10.281
That begins the mid-south.

05:10.784 --> 05:13.468
I was Quentin and didn't know it.

05:13.508 --> 05:17.874
I was a little brooding young man who was very frightened having gone off to school for the first time.

05:18.515 --> 05:21.059
I was very ruminative and introspective.

05:21.419 --> 05:22.561
I was very sensitive.

05:22.661 --> 05:25.826
I hadn't yet found what it was I was to become, which was a poet.

05:26.387 --> 05:30.493
I never would have dreamed because in high school I was a really profound athlete.

05:30.513 --> 05:34.058
And I captained my Yale soccer team and Yale crew team.

05:34.879 --> 05:36.401
And then I went on to play varsity soccer.

05:36.421 --> 05:37.122
I was an athlete.

05:37.242 --> 05:38.985
I was a character

05:39.421 --> 05:40.723
Caught in the middle.

05:40.783 --> 05:45.069
I didn't know what I was developing into at that time when I read The Sound and the Fury and those other books.

05:45.750 --> 05:46.972
But I was Quentin.

05:46.992 --> 05:57.126
And I know now, because I've written some very beautiful poems in a book called Mississippi Vistas, actually I've written a trilogy of southern poems.

05:57.697 --> 05:59.880
called the Mississippi Trilogy.

05:59.900 --> 06:06.248
Mississippi Vistas is volume one, which Malcolm Cowley and Penn Warren and Pleant all loved, and they've endorsed.

06:06.428 --> 06:12.677
And then there's volumes two and three, Mistress Mississippi and Disappearing in Mississippi Latitudes, which will come out in the next few years.

06:12.717 --> 06:19.285
But those books all attest to that original association, I guess.

06:19.325 --> 06:26.775
Now, that's an elaborate way of telling you how I came to folk, because in essence, what happened when I first went into winning,

06:28.460 --> 06:30.063
I saw some Faulkner books, too.

06:30.484 --> 06:35.854
But at the time, when I first began, and I wanted to have all those books near me, I thought, wouldn't it be neat to have a Sister Carrie?

06:35.874 --> 06:37.677
Well, I didn't have a signed one.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.122
Wouldn't it be nice to have a Main Street?

06:40.142 --> 06:42.446
Wouldn't it be nice to have a book of Faulkner's?

06:43.208 --> 06:51.784
At the Yale Co-op, no one was collecting Faulkner's, so at the Yale Co-op, there were three signed limited editions, Requiem, The Town, and The Mansion.

06:52.490 --> 07:16.506
When I went there in 59 they were all on the shelves for like six or seven bucks and they had what at the time I wouldn't have called uh certificate of limitation pages or colophon pages, but they had his inscription his, not a description, his signature those pages so I bought those, and then I thought oh that's real neat. I have some signatures by the man who wrote the book. When uh like what year in school? That was in 59 and 60.

07:16.739 --> 07:18.402
Those were my first years at Yale.

07:18.422 --> 07:20.526
So you became a collector?

07:20.727 --> 07:22.610
Well, I collected 10 or 12 writers.

07:22.670 --> 07:25.837
I had a few Tennessee Williams, a few Lewis, a few Dreiser.

07:26.518 --> 07:28.121
Who else did I collect?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.103
A few Robert Frost.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.045
I loved Frost.

07:30.586 --> 07:31.628
I said Tennessee Williams.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.151
I had a couple Faulkner books.

07:33.171 --> 07:35.355
By the time I left Yale, they gave me an award.

07:35.707 --> 07:36.969
I'll never forget the trauma.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.793
Did you win the Book Collecting Award?

07:38.813 --> 07:40.376
I'll never forget the trauma.

07:40.396 --> 07:43.722
They gave me second place in the Arthur Hoskins Award.

07:43.802 --> 07:44.183
Oh, Jesus.

07:44.283 --> 07:45.565
That's a big award at Yale.

07:45.585 --> 07:50.114
Yeah, but they gave me second place, and it was so disillusioning, I was shattered.

07:50.134 --> 07:51.216
Well, who got first place?

07:51.256 --> 07:52.959
Well, that's what I'm leading up to.

07:53.420 --> 07:57.107
By the time that award, by the time I made my...

07:57.863 --> 08:03.685
entry as a senior I had almost 200 and some odd Faulkner books, not many of them valuable.

08:04.207 --> 08:08.262
But I'd already at that point decided I wasn't going to collect all those other people.

08:08.765 --> 08:11.148
And so I began trading those books in.

08:11.168 --> 08:13.110
And I began acquiring more of the Faulkner books.

08:13.130 --> 08:15.713
And they were cheap books, $5, $6, $8, $10 dollar books.

08:15.733 --> 08:19.697
But there were a couple hundred, and the collection was pretty neat.

08:19.897 --> 08:23.962
So I entered the contest, and I just knew I was going to win.

08:24.022 --> 08:26.845
It was one of those things that you do, and you know you're going to succeed.

08:27.386 --> 08:31.110
Well, when it was awarded, when the awards were made,

08:31.867 --> 08:35.031
two things happened, and they both shattered me.

08:35.051 --> 08:50.533
One was an ironic blow, because in being told that I was given second place, and that I had been beaten out by a collector of railroad timetables, I thought, Jesus Christ, is this book collecting?

08:50.833 --> 08:51.614
What am I doing?

08:51.634 --> 08:56.621
Here I thought I was a book collector, and it's obvious that that's not what book collecting is all about, because timetables won.

08:57.142 --> 08:58.844
That disillusioned me, I remember.

08:58.864 --> 08:59.745
Do you remember who it was?

08:59.765 --> 09:01.047
I don't remember, but...

09:01.786 --> 09:08.274
The other thing I do remember about that was that the award they gave me for second place, first place was a cash prize.

09:08.955 --> 09:15.903
Second place was a second printing of A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway with No Dust Jack.

09:17.045 --> 09:20.749
And this was just somehow real ironic to me.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.814
So it was... Is it still rankled?

09:24.834 --> 09:27.778
It only rankles enough so that I would still remember to tell it to you.

09:27.838 --> 09:29.099
I find it quite amusing.

09:29.119 --> 09:29.700
It rankles.

09:30.068 --> 09:31.731
I guess it does rank on it.

09:31.791 --> 09:32.653
Maybe it does.

09:32.673 --> 09:41.831
You know, this is very interesting to me, I'll tell you, because this book collecting prize is a very cute way, you know, to get people.

09:42.733 --> 09:46.761
I mean, there's an ulterior motive to this whole thing, you know, the university stuff.

09:47.332 --> 09:51.058
I mean, what they try to do is nurture the future benefactors.

09:51.078 --> 09:51.558
Sure.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.281
Well, that's where I was, this little guy.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.022
I was like 21.

09:54.162 --> 09:55.805
I say little guy.

09:55.825 --> 09:57.587
I wasn't little physically, but I was young.

09:57.968 --> 09:58.769
And I was immature.

09:58.809 --> 10:00.612
And here I was on the brink of that.

10:01.273 --> 10:03.877
If they were trying to nurture me, Franz Liebert, was that his name?

10:03.897 --> 10:04.838
Herbert.

10:04.858 --> 10:06.420
Herman Liebert.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.425
He was a real book collector from Yale and an important book person.

10:09.685 --> 10:11.648
Herman Fritz Liebert.

10:12.469 --> 10:14.352
And he's the one who conducted the awards.

10:14.855 --> 10:18.080
And he was a real big book man in New York.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.264
Part of the Grolier Club, I think.

10:21.404 --> 10:22.646
I wonder why you didn't get it.

10:24.168 --> 10:28.855
Well, someone decided that the collection of timetables was more significant.

10:29.035 --> 10:37.046
Do you think that the kid who wanted, I hate to be a true cynic, though, was a very wealthy kid?

10:37.066 --> 10:37.447
Oh, yeah.

10:37.467 --> 10:38.829
And I think that's quite possible.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.352
Knowing what I learned at Yale, and I learned a lot,

10:41.568 --> 11:10.866
What I learned a lot about was nepotism. Yeah there's a whole lot of. What I'm saying is maybe they're looking to the future you know. Maybe they were and who knows. Uh all I was was a kid from the midwest who had about 200 Faulkner books. At the time I was collecting Faulkner books, Nick, there were three Faulkner collectors in the whole country. Faulkner was in disrepute. That's why I could buy, that's why I could buy three signed limited editions of this of the Mansion the Town and Requiem for a Nun at the Yale co-op as remainder copies

11:11.234 --> 11:12.998
They had five or six of each of those.

11:13.038 --> 11:16.626
They'd come up from New York and been remaindered and sitting in the book.

11:16.686 --> 11:21.958
Maybe this judge imposed his own literary myopia on you.

11:22.018 --> 11:24.784
Maybe he thought that you were not collecting productively.

11:25.045 --> 11:29.294
Maybe he was also trying to tell me that Ernest Hemingway was infinitely more significant.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.677
That's why they gave me that book.

11:31.012 --> 11:34.278
Maybe he was trying to tell me you're a jerk off for collecting your fault.

11:34.739 --> 11:36.442
Here's the guy you should be collecting.

11:36.542 --> 11:38.225
I mean, I don't know.

11:38.246 --> 11:39.568
It's an interesting thought.

11:39.728 --> 11:41.772
At what point do you realize that you're a collector?

11:41.792 --> 11:42.213
What is it?

11:42.233 --> 11:44.918
I mean, a collector, you know?

11:44.938 --> 11:48.745
I think you realize that at least I'm not going to speak for all collectors.

11:48.765 --> 11:50.809
I think whether it's

11:52.612 --> 11:54.637
Well, let's start taking another test.

11:54.737 --> 12:01.554
Just let me say, by passing the Mark Twain bank, just a little bit of color for the test.

12:01.594 --> 12:07.268
Yeah, we're on circumferential Highway 270, spurting St.

12:07.308 --> 12:09.393
Louis, getting ready to head south.

12:10.015 --> 12:10.215
OK.

12:10.533 --> 12:17.463
I think when you know you're a collector is when all of a sudden you can't verbalize it, but a certain passion infects you.

12:18.244 --> 12:26.435
And I was obviously, at that early date, infected with the passion of collecting not books, but Faulkner.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.658
I would like to put it that way.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.705
I don't think of myself as a book collector, but someone so turned on

12:34.090 --> 12:35.674
to someone who made books.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.356
Except that.

12:36.416 --> 12:40.468
Why then was it necessary to get first editions?

12:40.488 --> 12:44.860
Why couldn't you just content yourself with copies of the text to read?

12:45.987 --> 13:13.041
Okay well I think I tried to suggest that and I'll do it better now. I began to feel passionately involved with Quentin Tompson and with the other members who were playing roles in the book called the Sound and the Fury and because I was so totally drawn into that just as if you went to a play on Broadway and it was affecting enough, that it drew you in, that it made you a believer. Well the Sound and the Fury made me a believer and I thought my god anybody who can write like that

13:13.308 --> 13:14.470
I want to read more.

13:14.710 --> 13:15.551
Yeah, but the artifact.

13:15.571 --> 13:17.233
Well, I wanted the artifact.

13:17.314 --> 13:19.617
I needed a personal connection.

13:19.657 --> 13:22.441
All points present, dust jackets, you know what I'm saying?

13:22.521 --> 13:24.003
No, it didn't start out with that at all.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.526
There was not that in place in the beginning.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.109
That came much later.

13:28.910 --> 13:32.034
But what there was in the beginning was this affinity.

13:32.755 --> 13:36.420
And an affinity so strong that it wasn't just emotional.

13:37.161 --> 13:39.164
It almost was anagogical.

13:39.465 --> 13:40.506
It was almost mystical.

13:40.967 --> 13:41.948
And I sensed it.

13:42.316 --> 13:50.368
And it was at that time that the young poet that I hadn't yet become was evolving, was trying to phoenix out of me, out of my soul.

13:51.109 --> 13:59.561
And it was taking the shape of little Quentin, who himself was an extremely poetic, if ineffectual character in American literature, in life, if you will.

14:00.683 --> 14:02.265
I probably...

14:02.583 --> 14:04.747
was Quentin.

14:04.767 --> 14:10.877
I probably still have some of Quentin's attributes, but I grew into a man who is effective into an artist.

14:10.897 --> 14:12.360
Spell Quentin for my type.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.685
Q-U-E-N-T-I-N, Tompson, T-O-M-P-S-O-N.

14:15.705 --> 14:16.507
That's for my type.

14:17.729 --> 14:25.342
But Nick, I did know that I wanted to hold a book that Faulkner had put his hand to, at least I thought he had, long enough to sign it.

14:25.362 --> 14:27.105
In fact, if I had known much about

14:27.811 --> 14:43.496
first signed limited editions at that time, like I know now, I would also know that he probably never had put his hand to that particular book, rather that Random House would have sent him a couple hundred sheets for him to sign, and then he would have returned them, and then they got sewn into the book.

14:43.576 --> 14:45.820
But I sensed that he had had his hand.

14:45.900 --> 14:51.930
At the time, there were no presentation copies of Faulkner available.

14:51.990 --> 14:55.135
Matter of fact, as I said to repeat, no one collected Faulkner.

14:55.115 --> 15:00.364
Linton Massey, a man at the time I didn't know at all, Carl Peterson had already been collecting.

15:00.584 --> 15:04.611
Toby Holtzman had been collecting in Michigan.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.474
Holtzman is H-O-L-T-Z.

15:06.935 --> 15:07.516
M-A-N.

15:07.716 --> 15:15.309
Erwin T. Holtzman, he just gave his collection to Michigan, University of Michigan, but his collection he truncated.

15:15.329 --> 15:16.431
He sold his off to him.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.880
He didn't have near the collection that Carl and I had.

15:19.561 --> 15:22.287
But he took all the good stuff to get some money and sold those off.

15:22.307 --> 15:24.250
And I bought a bunch of those pieces.

15:24.331 --> 15:28.599
And then he gave and made a big to-do at Michigan about how he gave his collection.

15:28.659 --> 15:32.226
And all he gave was the bottom of the pyramid.

15:33.228 --> 15:35.172
You know, the base.

15:35.653 --> 15:38.959
Gave the base, but not the finical material.

15:39.580 --> 16:09.520
Anyway there were no people collecting that. I got interested in collecting and wanting to own books by Faulkner because I thought my god anyone who can write like that I want to be close to him. And if but i had that same feeling at one time for Tennessee Williams. I just thought it was intriguing to be able to have a book with the inscription of the author in it. Now I was only 21 and I collected at Yale and I went home from Yale back to St. Louis with about 200 books 250 something like that

16:09.837 --> 16:31.778
and uh a Farewell to Arms in my collection. And you thought that your collection was really hot stuff out there right? Well it was hot stuff I thought because when I went back to St. Louis and I entered Washington University first with the thought of taking a business degree and then working toward a master's in English in 1964 just a year after I got back there, we put on

16:31.960 --> 16:36.926
at Washington Hughes Olin Library, a wonderful first exhibit of Faulkner.

16:37.347 --> 16:38.208
And that was real nice.

16:38.268 --> 16:40.270
And it was followed in 65 by the St.

16:40.310 --> 16:43.494
Louis Public Library downtown putting on the exhibit.

16:43.514 --> 16:44.495
They were very impressed.

16:44.535 --> 16:47.599
Now, that exhibit did not have a Marble Faun in it.

16:48.180 --> 16:49.882
It did not have any inscribed copies.

16:49.902 --> 16:53.246
It certainly had no letters, no inscribed photographs, no manuscripts.

16:53.727 --> 16:57.111
It just was a run of first editions that were assorted.

16:57.131 --> 17:00.415
It had none of the quality Faulkner books because I was

17:01.137 --> 17:02.559
Just beginning.

17:02.579 --> 17:03.119
Just beginning.

17:03.940 --> 17:08.807
And yet, an interesting thing happened at that time, and I didn't remember it until right now.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.829
Toby Holtzman happened to have been in St.

17:10.869 --> 17:17.357
Louis on an architect's convention, attending an architect's convention.

17:17.377 --> 17:19.079
He was a builder.

17:19.099 --> 17:23.264
And he saw in the paper the advertisement for the collection being exhibited at the St.

17:23.284 --> 17:23.925
Louis Public Library.

17:23.945 --> 17:24.546
He phoned me.

17:25.387 --> 17:26.809
And he came out and we visited.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.572
We spent a day together.

17:28.592 --> 17:29.934
And I thought, well, that's really fun.

17:29.954 --> 17:35.422
Here's another man who's really avidly interested in what I'm doing and no one else was.

17:36.624 --> 17:39.288
And so I met Toby way back.

17:39.769 --> 17:42.433
Then I didn't see Toby for another 10 or 12 years after that.

17:43.214 --> 17:45.257
But then when we saw each other again, we knew right away.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.121
Did the collection ever go into a dormant phase at all?

17:48.141 --> 17:48.742
Yeah, it did.

17:49.604 --> 17:51.326
They came back from Yale in 64.

17:51.867 --> 17:53.149
And by 67,

17:53.585 --> 18:03.804
I had taken on a new interest altogether, and that was the collecting of Americana, horn phonographs, music machines, brass cash registers, sewing machines that were quite antique.

18:03.824 --> 18:04.425
You're a collector.

18:04.825 --> 18:06.108
Well, that's part of it, too.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.332
You'd find that with most book collectors.

18:08.512 --> 18:12.439
There are prior collections and prior activities.

18:12.479 --> 18:13.922
I learned this with Bill Hayen.

18:14.105 --> 18:15.186
He's a stamp collector.

18:15.206 --> 18:16.647
I used to be a stamp collector.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.290
Carl Peterson, I think, told me he was a coin collector.

18:19.310 --> 18:22.293
He collected other strange stuff, too, like collectors do.

18:22.313 --> 18:25.075
I collected bottle caps when I was a little kid.

18:25.095 --> 18:26.096
You know, stuff like that.

18:26.697 --> 18:29.279
And I still tend to keep junk.

18:29.299 --> 18:30.520
Well, I'm a junk keeper.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.501
I keep everything.

18:31.581 --> 18:35.685
All my letters, the envelopes, bills.

18:35.905 --> 18:36.806
But that's who we are.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.990
And I think part of that, the best part of that,

18:41.662 --> 19:01.442
attitude may be that you cherish your living so that you want to keep all the little parts of it together. You want to. I think it's going to be it. What is this fascination for things? I knew as a poet as much as anyone appreciates the fragility of life. Oh absolutely. It's such an ephemeral

19:02.148 --> 19:08.797
existence, is it ironic, then, that we should place such a great value on objects?

19:09.197 --> 19:10.719
No, I don't think it's ironic at all.

19:11.220 --> 19:12.762
I think it's a way of holding on.

19:13.102 --> 19:24.958
What I do with my writing, the poetry, I'm very, very aware that it's not a futile, but a feverish attempt to arrest all of these moments that I can, these beautiful, precious moments.

19:25.739 --> 19:30.585
And I said somewhere at a writer's conference that I

19:31.021 --> 19:48.364
shared in or participated in recently that one of the lines from one of my poems says something that this affected, my dying shall not be squandered on cosmic silence, which is an attempt to want to leave something behind, which is an attempt to say no to death.

19:49.125 --> 19:52.970
And I do it with the art, with my art, with my poetry, with my writing.

19:52.990 --> 19:56.995
It's a way of saying, yeah, Brodsky was here, or Faulkner used to call it, Kilroy was here.

19:57.633 --> 20:00.347
But I do it with the collecting too.

20:00.769 --> 20:06.276
I got to the point where what I wanted to do with the collecting so that it would have been a devastation to consider getting rid of it.

20:06.948 --> 20:09.771
And I ultimately knew that it would have to go into the public domain.

20:09.852 --> 20:12.655
It's important that the collection is a statement.

20:12.675 --> 20:13.876
Yes, it is a statement.

20:13.936 --> 20:17.321
It's important to you that it be the Brodsky collection, too.

20:17.481 --> 20:18.562
I don't have a big ego.

20:18.722 --> 20:20.384
I don't really care, Nick.

20:20.444 --> 20:22.787
One bit that it's the Brodsky collection at this point.

20:22.887 --> 20:24.149
I'm going to challenge you on that.

20:24.169 --> 20:26.211
Well, we can talk about it more and we can find out.

20:26.752 --> 20:27.753
I truly don't.

20:27.773 --> 20:28.474
I am an artist.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.355
I'm a poet.

20:29.836 --> 20:30.897
All that's behind me.

20:31.417 --> 20:41.550
The collection is a testimony to passion, enormous passion, a great desire to want to bring something together for various reasons, most of them scholarly.

20:42.251 --> 20:44.214
I got great enjoyment out of doing it.

20:44.735 --> 20:49.901
I get equal pleasure in knowing that it is somewhere relatively safe now where people in the future can enjoy it.

20:50.402 --> 20:54.107
You can take my name off of it today, and I couldn't give one flaming shit.

20:54.888 --> 20:57.171
Now, I would not say the same thing with my poetry.

20:57.893 --> 21:03.165
I have a great ego as an artist, but it is not again that I need celebrity.

21:03.185 --> 21:04.788
It is that I need you to read my work.

21:04.828 --> 21:11.042
This collection came to this school that we're going to today with some

21:12.001 --> 21:13.904
Pretty tight strings attached.

21:14.364 --> 21:17.829
No, one reason it went to that school is a no-name school.

21:17.929 --> 21:22.155
You imposed some very strict... Well, that was just so that no one would fuck it up.

21:22.416 --> 21:22.516
Okay.

21:22.556 --> 21:23.898
But I put it there.

21:23.918 --> 21:26.101
That ought to tell you a little bit about my attitude.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.503
Why isn't it at the Beinecke?

21:27.603 --> 21:28.224
Why isn't it?

21:28.264 --> 21:32.550
Well, because... Certainly not because you got second place in the book collecting competition.

21:32.570 --> 21:34.713
No, that's true.

21:34.733 --> 21:36.135
It isn't...

21:36.115 --> 21:38.739
I'll show you, you sensitive.

21:39.219 --> 21:41.763
Did you know something?

21:41.783 --> 21:46.569
That's the same attitude, though, that kept it from kidding me.

21:46.589 --> 21:47.791
Don't get mad yet even, right?

21:47.811 --> 21:48.792
It wasn't that at all.

21:48.852 --> 21:49.914
It was their attitude.

21:50.014 --> 21:50.455
It prevailed.

21:50.895 --> 21:53.058
They are still arrogant.

21:53.098 --> 21:54.640
Did you offer it to them by the key?

21:54.660 --> 21:55.021
Yes, twice.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.763
They're still trying, interestingly.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.586
What a nice connection that is.

21:58.626 --> 22:00.629
P-E-I-N-E-C-K-E.

22:00.749 --> 22:05.295
I still can now, at least if we want to impose something on it in hindsight,

22:06.102 --> 22:17.319
The attitude that they gave to me, expressed to me when I went there twice, they didn't have an acting librarian either time, and so they were, I'm sorry, a full librarian, the head of the library, they had acting librarians.

22:17.339 --> 22:33.122
And both times, they gave me such an arrogant attitude toward me and toward the collection, suggesting that it really wasn't all that significant in relation to all of their significant collections, which indeed it was.

22:33.862 --> 22:39.548
It's every bit as good as their Whitman and their O'Neill and their Joyce collections, as far as I'm concerned.

22:39.568 --> 22:46.275
Maybe what they're saying, maybe what they're suggesting is that, in their view, Faulkner had that.

22:46.816 --> 22:48.898
I don't see how they could take that position, though.

22:48.918 --> 22:50.079
I'll tell you what their attitude was.

22:50.139 --> 22:51.941
Maybe he wasn't in the same league as Joyce.

22:52.201 --> 22:52.702
No, no.

22:52.722 --> 22:53.463
It wasn't that.

22:53.483 --> 22:57.006
It was they discovered that I had published a lot of the work already.

22:57.187 --> 23:01.371
Although even what they didn't discover was that even though I've published it in certain ways,

23:01.739 --> 23:04.102
It is there to be published and mined for years.

23:05.644 --> 23:16.499
They thought that I had somehow diminished its importance to them as being capable of attracting scholars to the Meineke to work with the materials.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.984
That was the best they could offer me, and the worst is they didn't want to pay any money.

23:20.369 --> 23:21.411
That's important.

23:21.431 --> 23:24.517
Well, it's important, but they have tons of money and they buy things all the time.

23:24.577 --> 23:27.122
And this collection would have given them great distinction.

23:27.944 --> 23:28.885
And they were real arrogant.

23:28.905 --> 23:30.789
And I finally said fully on you guys.

23:30.889 --> 23:32.051
Twice we tried.

23:33.274 --> 23:41.770
Why I put it at CMO Finley was because those people seemed to make me feel that it would be a real important asset to a school like Southeast Missouri State.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.610
We've already begun bringing people there from all over the world.

23:45.171 --> 23:47.734
We had a lady there from Amsterdam studying it a month ago.

23:48.455 --> 23:50.357
We haven't even opened it up to the public yet.

23:50.718 --> 23:52.080
And we've had a number of people there.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.541
We had a German scholar last year.

23:54.022 --> 23:58.067
When it gets open to the public, we'll bring people to that little town in southern Missouri.

23:58.908 --> 24:00.270
And it is an out-of-the-way place.

24:00.330 --> 24:01.151
And it isn't Yale.

24:01.451 --> 24:02.893
And it isn't University of Virginia.

24:03.414 --> 24:05.597
But it'll forevermore be important in its own right.

24:05.717 --> 24:08.280
It makes me feel good.

24:09.138 --> 24:11.641
This would be one collection at Yale.

24:12.222 --> 24:13.704
That's right.

24:13.724 --> 24:17.448
And a great collection, but one of many great collections at Yale.

24:17.669 --> 24:21.554
Here, this stands out like the arch on the banks of the Mississippi.

24:21.574 --> 24:22.775
So maybe that is my ego.

24:23.736 --> 24:25.318
Maybe that is my ego after all.

24:25.418 --> 24:26.279
I was guessing that in a way.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.121
Maybe you're right.

24:27.141 --> 24:34.690
I know this simply, that I don't have a real big ego for people having to celebrate my work.

24:35.159 --> 24:42.287
especially my collecting work, because as an artist, I think of myself first and foremost not as a book collector.

24:42.307 --> 24:45.870
Matter of fact, we can talk about some of the psychology of that later.

24:46.271 --> 24:58.624
I got to the point, one of the reasons I had to give it away when I gave it away was because I was tired of people dealing with me as a collector and as a Faulkner scholar, because I'd hit a point in my life where that was no longer tenable.

24:58.704 --> 25:01.487
I had done that as long as I could do it,

25:02.142 --> 25:07.767
and still retain my own sense, unique sense of who I am, because what I really am is not a collector.

25:08.128 --> 25:21.960
I am, and I knew a long time ago that I was an artist, a poet, a writer, and that the collecting only satisfied certain needs that I had that were emotional, that were psychological, that might have been spiritual at one point.

25:22.361 --> 25:25.123
I long ago outgrew Faulkner.

25:25.143 --> 25:29.027
I actually got to the point where I believed I was as good an artist

25:29.463 --> 25:34.352
that I was as good at my poetry as Faulkner got at his best as a prose writer.

25:34.453 --> 25:41.927
Faulkner always wanted to be a poet, and he always lamented that he was a second-rate, or as he called it, a failed poet.

25:41.947 --> 25:47.117
It gave me great stimulus to want a challenge, what a wonderful challenge,

25:47.519 --> 25:50.443
to see if I could become the Faulkner of poets in America.

25:51.204 --> 25:57.972
And I have been desperately, furiously working toward that for at least the last 10 years, though I've been writing for 25.

25:58.032 --> 26:03.660
My writing poetry has almost run parallel to my collecting of Faulkner.

26:03.680 --> 26:12.531
But about 10 years ago, I realized that I was going to have to jettison the collection because I didn't want to expend that energy

26:12.730 --> 26:20.241
anymore to that degree on collecting or writing scholarly articles about William Faulkner.

26:20.281 --> 26:21.664
But you still are collecting them.

26:21.684 --> 26:25.069
I still am collecting them, but I'm doing it with a different mind.

26:25.630 --> 26:26.811
I'm acquiring.

26:26.831 --> 26:31.178
I'm still trying to develop it, as it were, but not with the same passion.

26:32.153 --> 26:36.798
because my full passion that I once gave to the collecting, I give to my writing.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.141
Now, I don't know if that's good or not.

26:39.161 --> 26:41.383
We don't have to put that in your article at all.

26:41.403 --> 26:43.926
But that's part of it too, jettisoning it.

26:44.026 --> 26:46.389
I no longer needed to collect Faulkner.

26:46.409 --> 26:52.376
There was part of the collecting derived from a physical almost requirement.

26:52.396 --> 26:58.022
I needed to collect Faulkner for my own sanity, my own security at a certain point in my life.

26:58.042 --> 27:00.405
It gave me a sense of place.

27:01.330 --> 27:01.911
Faulkner.

27:01.931 --> 27:02.652
That's what I am.

27:02.672 --> 27:03.614
I'm a Faulkner collector.

27:03.634 --> 27:05.437
Well, at least I know who I am.

27:05.517 --> 27:07.921
Well, there was a lot of that when I was a young man.

27:08.963 --> 27:16.136
And as I developed and I became more soundly grounded in my own sense that what I really am is an artist, an American poet.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.540
I no longer needed that other.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.303
So it's real interesting psychology.

27:20.423 --> 27:22.386
And there's a lot more to it.

27:22.446 --> 27:24.570
I'm just laying a little bit of that on the ground.

27:25.765 --> 27:28.988
They must have been overjoyed to get the collection down here.

27:29.008 --> 27:32.191
Did they, did they woo you, or is this something you proposed to them?

27:32.271 --> 27:33.753
It was something that I proposed.

27:33.793 --> 27:36.856
There was a wonderful man who is now not the president of the school.

27:36.876 --> 27:37.937
He just left last year.

27:38.537 --> 27:40.079
He'd been president for 10 years.

27:40.099 --> 27:41.660
He and I were almost contemporaries.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.502
Named Bill Stacy.

27:44.082 --> 27:47.085
Bill Stacy, uh... S-T-A-C-Y.

27:47.626 --> 27:48.367
S-T-A-C-Y.

27:48.867 --> 27:52.330
And he goes by the name of Bill, not William.

27:52.350 --> 27:54.152
President Bill W. Stacy.

27:54.875 --> 27:57.238
His background was in English and public speaking.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.240
He was yet an administrator.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.442
He was the president of the college.

28:00.862 --> 28:05.388
He had a great feel for aesthetics, for humanities.

28:06.049 --> 28:08.091
He wasn't just an administrator.

28:08.111 --> 28:17.884
He was absolutely overjoyed when I presented the notion, the prospect of allowing the collection to stay at Southeast Missouri State permanently.

28:18.004 --> 28:20.867
I had put it there in 1983 or 4.

28:22.069 --> 28:23.631
And he had made that possible.

28:23.651 --> 28:24.612
He gave us a...

28:25.790 --> 28:49.654
no strings attached a working environment so that Bob Hamblin and I could develop our work. Bob teaches at Southeast Missouri State. Bill Stacy never dreamed that the collection would end up at that university. He gave us a rare book room. He outfitted it from expenses out of the school with all the proper lighting and security equipment and air conditioning equipment

28:50.512 --> 28:52.094
And we set up shop in there.

28:52.115 --> 28:53.637
The books stayed there for five years.

28:53.777 --> 28:58.424
The school would insure them, which was a large savings for me.

28:58.565 --> 29:05.355
And there they stayed in relative isolation for Bob and myself to work on.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.821
And I proposed to Bill Stacy in 1988.

29:08.841 --> 29:13.448
I had actually started, Nick, with the University of Mississippi.

29:13.799 --> 29:14.761
in about 1984.

29:15.783 --> 29:16.886
Which makes sense.

29:17.086 --> 29:18.549
That's the logical home, isn't it?

29:18.569 --> 29:18.730
Yes.

29:18.750 --> 29:25.685
And I started talking with their then chancellor, Porter Fortune, who was very eager to have the collection there.

29:26.426 --> 29:30.475
And they had offered me, at that time, a million dollars for the collection.

29:31.778 --> 29:31.858
Yes.

29:33.610 --> 29:39.137
But as I continued discussions with them, I knew, number one, that the collection was worth a lot more than that.

29:39.157 --> 29:41.119
But that wasn't the issue.

29:41.340 --> 29:50.992
The critical issue was that they weren't going to give me a hand in staying with the collection, because I was too threatening to the people they had working.

29:51.012 --> 29:54.076
You see, to use your word, you haven't jettisoned the collection.

29:54.657 --> 29:55.317
No, I haven't.

29:55.337 --> 29:56.279
You're right.

29:56.679 --> 30:01.305
Because one of the stipulations is you require a hand.

30:01.690 --> 30:03.714
And what goes on?

30:04.155 --> 30:05.898
I still care about the collection.

30:06.299 --> 30:08.564
But you've even got a title down here now, don't you?

30:08.584 --> 30:09.606
Yes, I'm the curator.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.810
Okay, that's having a hand in it.

30:11.830 --> 30:18.663
Well, it is, and I'm real proud of that, because it wasn't that I had collected it to just jettison it, if you will.

30:19.064 --> 30:22.551
I meant I had to put it in a different way.

30:22.531 --> 30:27.400
I love the fact that we're entering Herculaneum in Missouri.

30:27.961 --> 30:30.005
Very soon you're going to hit the Festus.

30:30.566 --> 30:33.652
And then Crystal City.

30:33.753 --> 30:36.378
Actually, we're on our way to where I lived for 18 years.

30:36.558 --> 30:41.788
I lived in a small town of 8,500 people, Farmington, Missouri.

30:42.494 --> 30:49.123
put the bulk of the collection together, working out of Farmington, this little nowhere place 75 miles southeast of St.

30:49.143 --> 30:49.283
Louis.

30:49.344 --> 30:54.250
Well, I'm going to go to Farmington, Connecticut, where, you know, whose collection is out there.

30:54.270 --> 30:59.678
Wilmarth Lewis's Horace Walpole collection remains in situ, you know, I mean, it's in the house.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.001
Wilmarth Lewis taught at Yale, didn't he?

31:02.021 --> 31:02.862
Yeah, Yale owns it.

31:02.882 --> 31:03.784
I mean, that was the deal.

31:03.944 --> 31:07.569
It went to Yale, but the house went and everything stays in place.

31:08.250 --> 31:08.350
Nice.

31:08.600 --> 31:36.058
Interesting. Yeah yeah well listen people want to hold on to it. One of the things that I was healthy with to my good fortune was that I never had to physically have the books around me as I've known many collectors have had to have. You didn't have to sleep with them? No I didn't have to sleep with them at all, and it bothered me the whole notion of it when I was very young. But you did have to fondle them every once in a while? When I was really young I had to fondle them so to speak and I had to be with them and when I came back from Yale

31:36.359 --> 32:01.253
and I lived with my in my parents home I had a my own little study in the back of the house and I had the walls lined with those two or three hundred Faulkner books plus my new library from Yale and I was very proud of that and I was starting to write my poetry at that time and I did have my books there and I liked having them around me and even when I moved to Farmington in 67 I had

32:01.874 --> 32:26.852
No I didn't have the books with me then. They stayed at my parents home and then all the valuable books went into the safety deposit boxes in the Farmington bank. I didn't like that. But you see one of the great things about being a book collector is you can enjoy them on your own on a one-to-one basis. It's not like collecting art where you can somebody comes in and looks. I mean although

32:27.507 --> 32:39.745
That's on one level, and yet on another level, by opening it up to scholars and to those qualified and interested and motivated, you are sharing it with other people, but you can certainly enjoy it by yourself.

32:40.587 --> 32:52.705
I will tell you that I went through various stages of appreciation of the collection, and I feel now that I got to the point where I did not enjoy...

32:53.208 --> 33:04.965
just having the books around me physically, the fact that there were more and more and more attesting to the fact that, oh, I have a bigger collection, I've expended more energy, I've got a more valuable collection now.

33:05.345 --> 33:10.312
I got to the point where I didn't enjoy that at all, that rather they became so static.

33:11.134 --> 33:17.923
And it was at that point, and I went through stages, I told you, I hit a stage after I got back from Yale in St.

33:18.023 --> 33:19.806
Louis, where by 1967,

33:20.309 --> 33:26.103
which was only like seven years after I started collecting, I realized I had collected about as much as I was going to collect.

33:26.163 --> 33:33.179
I had no marble form, but I had a first run of books almost, and nothing was coming into the market.

33:33.280 --> 33:36.186
I quit collecting at that point, and I started collecting Americana.

33:37.089 --> 33:38.993
I didn't collect again until 74.

33:39.968 --> 33:43.131
I left the books sheets covering the books at my parents' house.

33:43.272 --> 33:43.712
What happened?

33:43.732 --> 33:44.933
You went into remission or something?

33:44.953 --> 33:45.234
I did.

33:45.454 --> 33:47.536
I put a moratorium on the collecting completely.

33:47.556 --> 33:49.078
I lost interest in it.

33:49.098 --> 33:50.559
I had moved to a small town.

33:50.780 --> 33:51.601
I had a different life.

33:51.861 --> 33:52.482
I had married.

33:53.122 --> 33:55.605
I was beginning to think about a family.

33:55.905 --> 33:57.067
I was working in a business.

33:57.127 --> 33:58.668
I was writing poems like mad.

33:59.369 --> 34:01.311
I was collecting Americana with my wife.

34:02.052 --> 34:03.834
I didn't have an interest in collecting books.

34:04.455 --> 34:08.018
I didn't see books coming up that had any interest to me.

34:08.038 --> 34:09.520
In 1974,

34:10.090 --> 34:19.695
Margie Cohn called me and said, I have 12 inscribed books that I got from a woman in California, the widow of one of Faulkner's early friends out there.

34:19.878 --> 34:21.721
His name was Hubert Starr.

34:21.741 --> 34:25.547
I ended up taking my first loan from a bank, and I bought nine of the 12 books.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.450
They were absolutely incredible.

34:27.490 --> 34:28.992
How much?

34:29.012 --> 34:36.845
I paid between $1,000 and $1,500 a book, which in 1974 was so staggering it scared the hell out of me.

34:36.905 --> 34:38.587
Well, so let me just tell you.

34:39.108 --> 34:48.062
I borrowed about $10,000 or $11,000, and it just scared the shit out of me because I'd never borrowed anything before, and I had to do it.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.485
Did it ever occur to you?

34:49.505 --> 34:53.674
Did it ever... I mean, did you say, well, that's an investment?

34:53.694 --> 34:54.896
No, I didn't do it for that.

34:55.277 --> 34:58.484
I said, uh-oh, here's something that I never knew I could ever have.

34:58.905 --> 35:00.488
Now, let me tell you what happened there.

35:00.508 --> 35:01.711
It was kind of exciting.

35:01.731 --> 35:05.038
About the same time that happened, I had been looking at Carl Peterson's book.

35:05.579 --> 35:08.565
It had just been published, and I was in awe of it.

35:08.765 --> 35:11.249
It was called A Faulkner Collector's Notebook.

35:11.569 --> 35:16.137
Let me also say for my typist, Margie, M-A-R-G-I-E-C-O-H-N, Annette.

35:16.978 --> 35:17.499
Okay, go ahead.

35:17.519 --> 35:19.622
I've been reading Carl's book.

35:20.163 --> 35:27.815
I've been reading Carl's book, and then Margie called me, and I thought, my God, I guess I can play this game again.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.558
So I took a great leap.

35:29.875 --> 35:32.178
Number one, I leaped back into collecting Faulkner.

35:32.238 --> 35:34.681
And I did it big time for me.

35:34.701 --> 35:36.303
I borrowed $10,000 or $11,000.

35:36.364 --> 35:38.106
I said, uh-oh, I'm in big trouble.

35:38.166 --> 35:44.334
It's like putting a glass of scotch under the nose of an alcoholic who hasn't touched a drink in two years.

35:44.474 --> 35:44.935
Correct.

35:44.955 --> 35:45.636
Nice analogy.

35:45.656 --> 35:46.457
Is that fair?

35:46.497 --> 35:49.100
Yeah, maybe five or seven years.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.342
And you gulped it down.

35:50.602 --> 35:53.546
And Chivas Regal.

35:53.586 --> 35:54.628
The good stuff.

35:54.648 --> 35:55.929
This was the good stuff.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.992
There were inscribed books.

35:58.090 --> 36:01.210
by Faulkner to Hubert Starr of The Sound and the Fury.

36:01.512 --> 36:02.941
Soldiers Pay, the first novel.

36:02.981 --> 36:04.692
Mosquitoes, the second novel.

36:04.992 --> 36:08.316
There was a rare Salma Gundy, a one of a kind.

36:08.336 --> 36:14.002
To this day, we don't know anyone else who has an inscribed Salma Gundy, which was a book limited to about 425 copies.

36:15.864 --> 36:18.447
Well, but I didn't do it because I thought it was an investment.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.329
I did it because it excited me.

36:20.369 --> 36:21.951
Did you talk this over with anybody in the family?

36:21.971 --> 36:22.351
No, I didn't.

36:22.371 --> 36:25.595
And then I came back to my wife and I said, I've done something real crazy.

36:26.135 --> 36:26.736
You told her, huh?

36:27.076 --> 36:28.418
Yeah, I told her.

36:28.438 --> 36:28.738
And...

36:29.630 --> 36:35.185
A lot of people might do this kind of thing without... It's like a closet drinker or something.

36:35.205 --> 36:35.947
I wouldn't have done that.

36:35.967 --> 36:37.531
Keeping a jug in the closet.

36:37.551 --> 36:39.175
Yeah, people do that.

36:39.195 --> 36:41.040
In the early years, she encouraged that.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.584
She certainly didn't discourage it.

36:42.604 --> 36:44.449
But what happened...

36:44.868 --> 37:12.242
was if I can get the dates right on this now I bought those books and all of a sudden I had nine inscribed copies. I still didn't have A Marble Faun. About four or five months later a wonderful auction came up in New York, I had known the collect known of the collector, a lady and I've forgotten her name right now, we'll get it, Bob will remember it, whose collection had come up it had five or six simulating Faulkner pieces in it from which I bought

37:12.543 --> 37:16.106
the galley proofs of the Hamlet, and then I bought my first Marble Faun.

37:16.587 --> 37:17.948
And that was exciting.

37:17.968 --> 37:19.970
But all of a sudden, I had a Marble Faun.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.332
And I said, wow, now I got a collection.

37:22.592 --> 37:26.416
Now I really have a first run of books, plus I got nine inscribed books.

37:26.436 --> 37:28.718
So I called Washington University.

37:28.738 --> 37:31.841
And at that time, Holly Hall was now the new director.

37:31.861 --> 37:42.010
The one who first saw the collection in 64 and wanted to put it on was William Matheson, who subsequently became the chief librarian at the Library of Congress, and is still there.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.227
He had great taste.

37:43.247 --> 37:45.771
He said, wow, what a collection, even in the early days.

37:46.071 --> 37:48.474
So Holly said, oh yeah, I'd love to put this exhibit on now.

37:48.975 --> 38:02.212
So in 76, 12 years later, after the first exhibit, we put on an exhibit that now really could boast a beautiful catalog.

38:02.292 --> 38:05.897
And the upshot of that, that was just spectacular.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.018
I was real proud.

38:08.078 --> 38:34.980
of that collection and I get a call about a week later from a man in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His name was Vance Broach. Vance said my daughter-in-law just called me and said there's a very wonderful Faulkner exhibit and she knows that her father-in-law loves Faulkner and collects Faulkner. It turned out that he didn't really collect Faulkner. He had he was the beneficiary of

38:35.399 --> 38:43.412
A very large collection that had come to him from his Aunt Bama McLean from Memphis, Tennessee.

38:43.432 --> 38:46.597
Her name was Alabama.

38:46.838 --> 38:49.562
Leroy Falkner McLean.

38:50.965 --> 38:52.147
F-A-L-K-N-E-R.

38:52.527 --> 38:56.193
She was the youngest daughter of the old colonel.

38:56.313 --> 39:01.542
It turns out that William Faulkner and Vance Broach were second cousins.

39:02.332 --> 39:12.425
It turns out that Aunt Bama left in her will all of her Faulkner materials to Vance, because Vance loved Faulkner's literature.

39:13.366 --> 39:22.417
Vance was considerably older than I. He was in his 60s then, middle 60s at the time I met him, which was like in 76, end of 76.

39:22.597 --> 39:25.181
I spoke with him.

39:25.201 --> 39:26.342
I got very excited.

39:26.422 --> 39:28.705
I said, well, yes, I have this collection.

39:28.905 --> 39:30.968
He said, oh, I'd love to see it, but I can't leave now.

39:31.428 --> 39:31.849
I said...

39:32.285 --> 39:35.748
Mr. Boach, I'd love to come and visit you.

39:35.768 --> 39:36.969
He never said what he had.

39:37.970 --> 39:51.082
It turned out that what he had was an entire run of another ten inscribed books, that he had Faulkner manuscripts and typescripts that Bama had been given by her nephew, William.

39:51.703 --> 39:57.048
It turns out more than that that Faulkner only loved Aunt Bama McLean.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.490
Bama Faulkner was his dear

39:59.875 --> 40:05.626
not love, but was the lady he most admired after his own mother, Maude.

40:06.647 --> 40:09.974
And she was one of the few people that ever held sway with him, Bama.

40:10.034 --> 40:12.699
I wrote about her a little bit in the Faulkner book.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.083
She's the one they called down when they were

40:15.400 --> 40:20.385
doing the premiere for Intruder in the Dust because they couldn't get Billy to get dressed up to go to the premiere.

40:20.405 --> 40:22.207
So they called Aunt Bama to come down from Memphis.

40:22.227 --> 40:22.708
That's great.

40:22.728 --> 40:25.671
So she drove to 70 miles down and yanked Billy out of the house.

40:25.691 --> 40:28.234
So let's get back to confronting this collection.

40:28.254 --> 40:29.455
So let me tell you what happened.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.417
I drove out to Tulsa.

40:31.437 --> 40:35.681
And all of a sudden, I drove out to Tulsa.

40:35.701 --> 40:36.082
From where?

40:36.122 --> 40:36.442
From here?

40:36.482 --> 40:36.863
From St.

40:36.883 --> 40:37.403
Louis.

40:37.844 --> 40:38.785
From Farmington, sorry.

40:38.805 --> 40:39.586
From Farmington.

40:40.907 --> 40:41.768
But I mean here.

40:41.848 --> 40:41.948
Yeah.

40:42.603 --> 40:44.467
five or six hour drive, and I was really excited.

40:44.487 --> 40:45.429
I just took off from work.

40:45.830 --> 40:47.092
I said, I got to go meet this man.

40:47.674 --> 40:51.341
Well, I got there, and he showed me all these incredible books.

40:51.822 --> 40:55.230
And here I had just acquired some inscribed books, which never came up on the market.

40:55.771 --> 41:02.285
And I thought, all of a sudden, I realized the great insight that was going to make the whole collection from that point on.

41:02.365 --> 41:03.447
It was the pivot point.

41:04.118 --> 41:07.222
Doing the exhibit at Washington, you created the first exposure.

41:07.362 --> 41:10.185
Then people now were aware of your existence.

41:10.366 --> 41:14.210
All of a sudden, what I realized, that Carl Peterson's book couldn't teach me.

41:14.771 --> 41:28.708
What Carl Peterson's book taught me a couple years before was, my God, here's a man, one man, who could put together this whole collection, this one author collection, and if he can do that, I'll bet you I can dream high enough to do that same thing.

41:29.077 --> 41:56.772
so I would read Carl's book till I had it memorized and then I met Vance and I said oh my god here's the other key to that puzzle, and it came to me not like a light going on, but it took time but what it was in essence was ah Faulkner was a human being. He had a whole network of people he'd known and who had known him, family associates Hollywood people New York people literary people

41:57.545 --> 42:01.852
Brodsky, there are people all over this country who knew Faulkner.

42:01.872 --> 42:04.176
He just died in 62, right?

42:04.196 --> 42:05.778
While I was still in college, he died.

42:06.439 --> 42:11.207
I said, Brodsky, there are people all over this country like Vance Broach.

42:11.227 --> 42:12.289
There just have to be.

42:13.050 --> 42:18.980
So the next thing I did, Joe Blotner's book had been published in 74, his two-volume biography.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.367
That was the other quintessential key that gave me

42:24.190 --> 42:42.688
the answers if you will. It's a mixed metaphor, but the answers to how I could go about putting a collection together. With Carl's book to show me that you could do it or that at least a man had done it put together that massive comprehensive a collection that I could at least set my standards

42:43.445 --> 42:45.208
to Carl's standards.

42:45.229 --> 42:49.457
I didn't dream I would ever accomplish what Carl did, let alone go way past.

42:49.477 --> 42:51.060
No, no, that's not what you said to me on the phone.

42:51.080 --> 42:57.232
You said he inspired me to not only, if he could do it, I could do it, and I could do it better.

42:57.352 --> 42:58.074
I think you said that.

42:58.154 --> 43:00.238
I would say that I got to that point.

43:00.573 --> 43:03.658
And maybe that's true, because that's my nature.

43:03.678 --> 43:04.819
Because you're competitive.

43:04.900 --> 43:05.661
I'm very competitive.

43:05.681 --> 43:06.282
You're a jerk.

43:06.302 --> 43:07.624
You don't want to like to lose.

43:07.784 --> 43:08.325
Well, you're right.

43:08.385 --> 43:09.747
I probably picked up that book.

43:09.787 --> 43:11.570
I guess what I told you was the right impulse.

43:11.950 --> 43:13.953
I'm a real competitive cuss.

43:14.574 --> 43:17.198
And I picked up that book, and I guess my first dreams were

43:17.178 --> 43:19.080
Although I wouldn't have verbalized him at that point.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.501
I can do it after the fact now.

43:21.122 --> 43:22.683
Yes, I'm sure the impulse was.

43:22.984 --> 43:27.668
Not only do I want to accomplish that, but in doing it, I certainly want to be better than he added.

43:28.069 --> 43:29.770
That's the same way I felt about my art.

43:30.091 --> 43:33.955
I want to be better than Faulkner at my poetry, than Faulkner was at his prose.

43:34.675 --> 43:36.317
I generate that way.

43:36.337 --> 43:37.198
That's the way I work.

43:38.159 --> 43:38.639
Am I?

43:38.659 --> 43:38.980
Yes.

43:39.340 --> 43:39.880
Yes, I am.

43:39.981 --> 43:42.443
I've now got there with the poetry.

43:42.777 --> 43:45.003
Yes, I am, and that's not arrogant.

43:45.023 --> 43:52.703
I think my poetry is every bit as profound and will be dealt with in schools and universities as Faulkner's prose.

43:52.723 --> 43:58.558
It has yet to be found, but Faulkner's prose wasn't found by a large public either until the late 40s.

43:59.163 --> 44:07.254
And I'm convinced that the distribution, the promulgation of paperbacks, which was new at that time, had more than anything to do with that.

44:07.675 --> 44:09.577
Are there Faulknerian themes?

44:09.637 --> 44:10.959
Oh, yes, there are some.

44:10.979 --> 44:11.660
Yes, of course.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.523
But there is not a Faulknerian voice.

44:14.404 --> 44:15.766
My own voice is in there.

44:15.866 --> 44:16.507
I couldn't do that.

44:16.527 --> 44:17.448
I wrote seven novels.

44:17.548 --> 44:20.072
They all were Faulknerian in style.

44:20.713 --> 44:22.035
That's why I never went on with that.

44:22.435 --> 44:24.899
There's seven complete novels in my apprenticeship.

44:24.999 --> 44:25.499
Were you L.D.

44:25.539 --> 44:27.502
Brodsky trying to be William Faulkner?

44:27.562 --> 44:28.123
Absolutely.

44:28.390 --> 44:38.525
I've got a wonderful poem in Mississippi Vistas where I talk about that, about the artist who's sitting on the lawn at Roanoke, and he's being gnawed by ants who've come to eat him.

44:38.565 --> 44:40.528
He's dying in the aura of Faulkner.

44:40.628 --> 44:41.690
It's more eloquent than that.

44:41.730 --> 44:47.839
I'd like to just put to insert that poem in there, and I forgot the title of it, but it's real interesting.

44:47.939 --> 44:53.267
Actually, there are a couple in that book where I talk about this poet who is being sundered.

44:53.973 --> 44:58.920
by the aura that Faulkner still created in Oxford, I would go there and write.

44:58.940 --> 45:01.804
And I realized in my collection... What are those hay things?

45:01.824 --> 45:02.946
Large hay bales.

45:02.966 --> 45:04.268
Hay bales, but they're rolled, huh?

45:04.288 --> 45:05.089
Yeah, they're rolled now.

45:05.109 --> 45:05.950
That's the way they do them.

45:05.970 --> 45:08.053
They're really large.

45:08.434 --> 45:10.877
They're big gleaners that pull that together.

45:11.338 --> 45:13.621
Combines.

45:13.882 --> 45:14.783
Where are we now?

45:15.488 --> 45:18.211
We're heading southeast down Highway 55.

45:18.231 --> 45:18.632
OK.

45:18.992 --> 45:20.474
Go ahead.

45:20.494 --> 45:20.694
I'm sorry.

45:20.714 --> 45:25.180
Anyway, I'm not, I don't feel real eloquent today, but to get back to the subject.

45:25.200 --> 45:25.921
You're doing fine.

45:26.061 --> 45:27.062
Don't worry.

45:27.823 --> 45:32.869
The subject is, where I left at was that I saw the two elements.

45:32.909 --> 45:33.610
They came to me.

45:33.650 --> 45:40.798
I couldn't have verbalized them, but the two elements were one that a man had done what Carl had done, had accomplished that, had put together a one-authored collection.

45:40.818 --> 45:42.981
And secondly, now that I'd met Vance Broach,

45:43.518 --> 45:48.843
What I found was that there was a Vance brooch and that Vance had the most incredible trove.

45:48.863 --> 45:49.864
B-R-O-A-C-H?

45:49.904 --> 45:51.305
Correct.

45:51.345 --> 45:53.947
He and I became dear friends.

45:54.027 --> 45:55.189
He loved my collection.

45:55.209 --> 45:56.129
He loved what I'd done.

45:56.690 --> 46:04.197
He had no real aesthetic appreciation for the fact that he owned inscribed copies, both to himself from Faulkner and to Aunt Bama.

46:04.837 --> 46:06.759
He didn't really care that he had the letters.

46:06.919 --> 46:09.201
He didn't really care that he had the manuscripts.

46:09.241 --> 46:10.522
He loved Faulkner's literature.

46:11.023 --> 46:13.525
I ended up trading him all kinds of editions

46:14.011 --> 46:16.654
in books that he preferred, that he wanted.

46:16.694 --> 46:18.056
He actually wanted quantity.

46:18.076 --> 46:18.957
It was very strange.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.339
So that was the approach I took with him.

46:21.419 --> 46:24.042
At that time, in my collection, I had all kinds of duplicates.

46:24.723 --> 46:28.688
I soon realized I never again wanted another duplicate in the collection.

46:29.288 --> 46:37.858
So I used up all those duplicates, hundreds and hundreds of duplicate copies that I probably bought for very little that I traded to him

46:38.463 --> 46:41.689
for maybe 50 or 60 or 70 items that he had.

46:42.330 --> 46:43.573
So no money changed hands?

46:43.633 --> 46:44.014
No money.

46:45.176 --> 46:45.456
Jesus.

46:45.496 --> 46:47.240
He didn't want money, and I didn't have money.

46:47.961 --> 46:50.145
But what he was was impressed with what I was doing.

46:50.686 --> 46:54.173
He loved the fact that I had put together the collection I had.

46:54.453 --> 46:57.940
Did he have a sense that these things were probably worth a lot of money?

46:57.960 --> 46:58.140
No.

46:58.501 --> 46:59.363
And you didn't tell him?

46:59.383 --> 47:01.146
No, I didn't, because I didn't.

47:01.312 --> 47:03.137
Oh, I'll tell you what I did, though.

47:03.157 --> 47:04.661
No, let's be fair about that.

47:04.741 --> 47:09.293
I had already bought nine inscribed books, and I knew I'd paid between $1,000 and $1,500 for them.

47:09.413 --> 47:10.035
I told him that.

47:10.055 --> 47:11.599
Oh, no, I told him that.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.406
I said, I'm going to trade you.

47:14.787 --> 47:16.131
No, because I had to deal with that.

47:16.151 --> 47:18.156
That was the first time I came to that problem.

47:18.490 --> 47:19.371
Let me tell you about it.

47:19.471 --> 47:24.597
I mean, does one have to go through some kind of ethical evaluation of what we're doing?

47:24.777 --> 47:25.037
Absolutely.

47:25.057 --> 47:25.918
Oh, absolutely.

47:26.098 --> 47:27.880
I had to deal with that, and it started there.

47:28.121 --> 47:31.985
And every time I dealt with another person, I had to size that up in my own mind.

47:32.405 --> 47:37.451
Could I justify doing any of the actions I was doing in an ethical manner?

47:37.771 --> 47:39.633
And if I couldn't, then I wouldn't do them.

47:39.653 --> 47:41.595
And with Vance, I made it very clear.

47:41.615 --> 47:43.758
I did an appraisal of his collection for him.

47:44.238 --> 47:45.780
My appraisal was very honest.

47:47.077 --> 47:49.881
My appraisal on his inscribed books was identical.

47:50.542 --> 47:52.505
Each item was identical in value.

47:52.525 --> 47:55.790
I appraised them at $1,000 to $1,500 a book.

47:55.810 --> 47:59.075
He was awed, but he wasn't frightened enough to keep them.

47:59.095 --> 48:01.699
He didn't think, my God, they're so valuable, I'm going to keep them.

48:01.719 --> 48:02.701
He wanted what I had.

48:03.101 --> 48:04.504
He came to our house in St.

48:04.544 --> 48:05.585
Louis, my parents' house.

48:05.605 --> 48:06.386
We had dinner together.

48:06.406 --> 48:08.730
He looked at the big collection that was still there.

48:09.318 --> 48:12.843
He wanted a whole bunch of shelves full of books.

48:13.564 --> 48:14.265
It was real strange.

48:14.345 --> 48:16.308
That was my first encounter.

48:16.328 --> 48:18.892
So that worked fine for me because I had duplicates.

48:18.912 --> 48:20.154
And this is about 76, 77.

48:20.294 --> 48:20.895
This was 77.

48:20.935 --> 48:29.847
So I traded him hundreds and hundreds of books that monetarily had an equivalent value to what he had.

48:30.248 --> 48:33.773
Aesthetically, collectorly wise, they were worthless.

48:34.445 --> 48:37.430
I gave him a full run of magazines as an example.

48:37.570 --> 48:40.114
I valued them at $15 to $20 a magazine.

48:40.474 --> 48:46.504
Well, okay, not much money, but by the time I traded him 200 magazines, you had a lot of money there.

48:46.764 --> 48:48.547
These all had Faulkner pieces?

48:48.607 --> 48:49.288
Oh, absolutely.

48:49.388 --> 48:52.393
I gave him, in essence, what I did, Nick, with him.

48:52.954 --> 48:56.719
I outfitted him with a massive Faulkner collection.

48:56.739 --> 48:59.844
Now, that was his psyche.

48:59.924 --> 49:00.605
He didn't care.

49:00.625 --> 49:01.186
He wanted bulk.

49:01.547 --> 49:02.308
He wanted bulk.

49:02.812 --> 49:06.455
He wanted to have shelves in his apartment full of Faulkner books.

49:06.796 --> 49:09.678
And a few association copies were irrelevant to him.

49:09.698 --> 49:10.139
They were.

49:10.459 --> 49:12.962
They were irrelevant to him because they didn't have any meaning to him.

49:13.502 --> 49:15.184
Because he knew Faulkner.

49:15.204 --> 49:16.004
They were OK.

49:16.605 --> 49:17.105
But they weren't.

49:18.467 --> 49:19.267
That's wonderful.

49:19.828 --> 49:20.749
Congratulations.

49:20.889 --> 49:22.931
Well, that was the first one.

49:22.951 --> 49:24.773
And it was interesting.

49:24.853 --> 49:26.314
And I hadn't taken advantage of him.

49:26.735 --> 49:27.475
And I'll tell you what.

49:27.495 --> 49:31.519
He had one book, and I'm thinking about it now, that was

49:31.938 --> 49:33.920
dear to him personally.

49:33.940 --> 49:35.241
It was the first book he'd ever read.

49:35.261 --> 49:38.344
It was Sartoris, and it was inscribed by Faulkner to Vance.

49:38.364 --> 49:41.187
And I know that Mrs. Broach still has the book.

49:41.227 --> 49:42.749
S-A-R-T-O-R-I-S.

49:42.949 --> 49:44.911
That's the one book he wanted to keep.

49:44.931 --> 49:53.299
He said, this is the only one that really has a personal meaning for me, even though some of the others were inscribed to him and to his Aunt Bama, McLean.

49:53.940 --> 49:54.901
That was a nice story.

49:55.422 --> 49:58.545
And what that did, I visited with him four or five times in Tulsa.

49:58.565 --> 49:59.466
He came to visit in St.

49:59.526 --> 50:01.928
Louis, and he stayed with us in Farmington, he and his wife.

50:02.195 --> 50:03.397
I love Shirley.

50:03.657 --> 50:08.002
She is really a dear woman, and she still writes me, and we still correspond.

50:08.203 --> 50:10.646
And the beautiful thing of all of it, he knew what I was doing.

50:10.926 --> 50:12.688
He knew I wasn't going to sell him.

50:12.708 --> 50:16.513
He knew that from the outset, or he wouldn't have let me have him.

50:16.533 --> 50:19.176
And I knew I wasn't going to sell him, and I told him I'm going to write about Anvail.

50:19.717 --> 50:23.061
And I already showed him what I was doing early on, and he liked all that.

50:23.161 --> 50:24.423
How old were you?

50:24.443 --> 50:26.285
Oh, I was at that time in 77.

50:26.505 --> 50:28.027
What was I, 30?

50:28.288 --> 50:28.908
You were in your 30s.

50:29.249 --> 50:30.210
My mid-30s.

50:30.663 --> 50:31.745
But that was my first.

50:32.686 --> 50:33.568
And then I knew.

50:34.509 --> 50:40.098
And so having read Blotner, religiously, he became my Bible, the biography.

50:40.118 --> 50:42.101
Did you just wish it were better written?

50:42.121 --> 50:46.689
It's not well written at all, but what it did do was give me... But the facts are there.

50:46.709 --> 50:50.234
It gave me a road map to the people who'd been part of Faulkner's life.

50:50.715 --> 50:56.164
And I began writing, I began calling, and over the next 10 or 12 years, I traveled all over the country.

50:56.549 --> 51:02.318
using Plotner as a roadmap to lead me to the people I needed to go to.

51:02.558 --> 51:04.120
Wow, let's pause on that.

51:04.140 --> 51:05.562
That's really good.

51:05.582 --> 51:13.735
He used a biography as a roadmap, as a source book, to become an activist, an interventionist kind of a collector.

51:13.955 --> 51:15.778
Wait, I'm just making up these words now.

51:15.798 --> 51:17.640
Yeah, good, good.

51:17.661 --> 51:21.426
I mean, a physician says they take invasive procedures.

51:21.446 --> 51:23.369
That's when they cut you open.

51:24.371 --> 51:26.033
So you actually are a collector.

51:27.177 --> 51:30.361
who has used invasive procedures.

51:30.482 --> 51:33.025
Well, let me tell you why I did that too, Nick.

51:33.045 --> 51:37.531
I never enjoyed... Let me back that up.

51:37.952 --> 51:40.075
When I met Henry Wenning, I enjoyed Henry.

51:41.036 --> 51:42.619
W-E-N-N-I-N-G.

51:42.639 --> 51:45.082
Henry was the first one I met in New Haven, I told you.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.063
Right, okay.

51:46.083 --> 51:47.105
In the early 60s.

51:47.565 --> 51:49.688
Henry was a very sophisticated man.

51:50.069 --> 51:55.176
He took a liking to me, so he saw I had an interest in the books, as books.

51:55.156 --> 51:58.421
And I was a young Yalie, and he would teach me.

51:58.441 --> 52:01.405
He'd say, oh, no, you never want to buy this book because its condition isn't right.

52:01.465 --> 52:03.308
Here's a book that someday you'll hope to buy.

52:03.528 --> 52:05.150
I can't sell you this one now because it's $100.

52:05.451 --> 52:09.397
It was Salma Gundy, and I have a collector for it.

52:09.417 --> 52:10.338
It turns out.

52:10.358 --> 52:11.580
That's a tough title to get.

52:11.620 --> 52:13.503
Well, it was in the beginning.

52:13.523 --> 52:14.504
Yeah, it's tough now.

52:14.524 --> 52:17.949
Well, I got five or six in the collection, and they're all variants, and they're all wonderful.

52:17.969 --> 52:19.832
It's got a little Hemingway poem in it, too.

52:20.112 --> 52:20.533
It does.

52:20.553 --> 52:22.456
It's got a poem ultimately on the back of it.

52:22.496 --> 52:24.859
A real strange little volume.

52:26.003 --> 52:31.129
I guess what I was going to say is the reason I took those invasive procedures was this.

52:32.271 --> 52:34.333
I made friends with Henry.

52:34.433 --> 52:35.695
Then I met Margie Kohn.

52:35.715 --> 52:38.659
He suggested I go meet Margie at the House of Books in New York.

52:38.679 --> 52:41.743
So on one of my trips to New York one weekend, I went and introduced myself.

52:42.323 --> 52:46.809
She was a lovely, wonderful, interesting, exciting lady to the young LD.

52:47.870 --> 52:51.775
And I made a friendship with her that lasted until her death in the 80s.

52:52.328 --> 52:53.750
And I just admired her.

52:53.830 --> 52:55.313
I loved going in and visiting with her.

52:55.493 --> 52:57.276
Over the years, I bought a number of books from her.

52:57.716 --> 53:03.325
Toward the end, toward the last six or seven years, every time I go in there, she'd say, oh, LD, I can't sell you another book.

53:03.345 --> 53:04.106
You have too much.

53:04.667 --> 53:05.789
I'm going to sell them to other people.

53:05.809 --> 53:08.333
And I'd say, Margie, god damn you, you can't do that.

53:08.513 --> 53:10.035
I'd say, that's no way to run a business.

53:10.096 --> 53:11.317
I need that book.

53:11.337 --> 53:14.683
I'm sorry, LD, you've got too many books.

53:14.763 --> 53:15.664
She was teasing you.

53:15.684 --> 53:16.465
Yeah, she was teasing me.

53:16.485 --> 53:20.732
And then occasionally, she'd let me have one or two that I wanted.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.562
I made friends with her.

53:22.842 --> 53:29.512
But my point is, I made friends with no other dealers until I met Glenn Horowitz in the early 80s.

53:29.793 --> 53:34.199
And I took a great liking to Glenn because Glenn was a deal-doer, and he was fun.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.001
He's a hustler.

53:35.021 --> 53:36.643
He's a hustler, and I enjoyed that.

53:37.304 --> 53:42.412
He and I have a lot of the same stuff, share a lot of that same hustler stuff in us, too.

53:42.432 --> 53:44.315
I don't want to go on record with that work.

53:44.335 --> 53:44.535
No.

53:45.116 --> 53:46.878
That was my word, actually.

53:46.898 --> 53:48.541
Yeah, it wouldn't be my word.

53:48.561 --> 53:50.584
He just has a real excitement and an energy.

53:50.902 --> 54:14.277
and a sense of challenge and he learned from me how to create a wonderful book business and I will sort of take some credit for it because he has credited me with having taught him how to go out and find the books. Now my point is this. I named the three book dealers on one hand and that's about the speed of it. Cccasionally I'd buy a book or I'd buy an occasional book

54:14.594 --> 54:18.359
from Maury Neville or from one or two other dealers.

54:18.379 --> 54:21.403
By and large, I never enjoyed receiving book dealers catalogs.

54:21.824 --> 54:23.466
It bored me.

54:23.486 --> 54:25.729
I would rather read a book of poetry or a book of fiction.

54:25.769 --> 54:32.378
Those bored me because by and large, collecting books out of book dealers catalogs for me was static.

54:33.379 --> 54:36.964
Going to book dealers to look over their shelves was static.

54:36.984 --> 54:40.028
What I learned from having met Vance, I'm a people person.

54:40.582 --> 54:55.630
I got the greatest pleasure of being invited to sleep at Vance's home, of being taken out to dinner by Vance and Shirley Broach, of being taken to meet their friends, of sharing in their children, of doing things with them, of having them come to St.

54:55.650 --> 54:58.455
Louis and Farmington and visit my family.

54:58.475 --> 55:01.240
I cared about book collecting on a personal level.

55:01.557 --> 55:07.691
I loved the fact that I knew the man who had known Faulkner, who had stayed at Roanoke.

55:07.771 --> 55:08.392
I loved that.

55:08.934 --> 55:12.281
That, to me, was what book collecting should be for me.

55:12.301 --> 55:13.263
It was dynamic.

55:13.444 --> 55:15.348
It's kind of like John Quinn collected, you know.

55:15.629 --> 55:16.731
Are you familiar with John Quinn?

55:16.751 --> 55:17.052
No, I'm not.

55:17.386 --> 55:18.668
He'll be in my book.

55:18.968 --> 55:20.470
I won't call you.

55:20.590 --> 55:21.892
That excited me.

55:21.952 --> 55:23.955
So that's the way I perceive it.

55:23.975 --> 55:24.916
Have you ever heard of John Quinn?

55:24.936 --> 55:26.798
I have, but I haven't read a lot of him.

55:26.818 --> 55:27.920
He's very important.

55:27.940 --> 55:28.981
Yeah, sure.

55:29.001 --> 55:29.562
He'll tell me about it.

55:29.582 --> 55:30.663
When the machine is off.

55:30.683 --> 55:31.705
Yeah, okay.

55:32.165 --> 55:34.248
But that to me, I was armed with Blotner.

55:34.288 --> 55:36.391
I was armed with my Peterson.

55:36.471 --> 55:38.474
I had now met Vance Broach.

55:38.494 --> 55:41.858
I had instead of nine inscribed Hubert Starbucks under my belt,

55:42.142 --> 56:07.845
and one Marble Faun I now had a second. Oh I know the kicker to that story. I had to not only give up all the duplicates but the one thing that killed me that he did want Vance would do all these deals but he wanted desperately a copy of the first Faulkner book. Well I had just four months earlier acquired my first Marble Faun and it meant a great deal to me

56:08.416 --> 56:14.393
Vance wanted the Marble Faun, and the whole deal, though it was unspoken, hinged

56:14.761 --> 56:42.220
and so I visited with him on three different occasions and each time he would let me have a little more of the material but it finally worked down to his having to acquire my Faun. Well that was a great sacrifice. I let it go and that was the best judgment I ever made. And at this point you don't have a Faun? No no now that was in 1977. But I mean at this point at that point when you gave that up? I gave it up and it was extremely significant. Yeah but did you have another? No I didn't so it took great guts

56:42.470 --> 56:52.046
Here, four months earlier, my heart had stopped with excitement when my package came from the auction house containing the first Marble Faun.

56:53.088 --> 56:57.214
Well, the Marble Faun was just the epitome of epitomes.

56:57.315 --> 57:04.667
Aesthetically, at that time, it was much more significant than any inscribe book or anything could ever be, because that's, as a collector, what any Faulkner collector dreamed of.

57:04.987 --> 57:06.570
Oh, you have to get a Marble Faun.

57:06.888 --> 57:10.091
I will tell you now, in hindsight, that I've had ten go through my hands.

57:10.171 --> 57:11.873
I still have five in the collection.

57:12.314 --> 57:15.457
I've used other ones to trade, but at that time it was really significant.

57:15.477 --> 57:16.037
Wait a minute.

57:16.078 --> 57:19.121
If you've got five in the collection, you say you don't want duplicate books.

57:19.261 --> 57:20.902
They're all different.

57:20.923 --> 57:25.307
One's inscribed... Well, three of them are inscribed to different people.

57:27.029 --> 57:31.073
The fourth one is an association copy of William Alexander Percy.

57:31.508 --> 57:34.331
And the fifth one has another distinction to it.

57:34.351 --> 57:35.333
Walker Percy's uncle.

57:35.353 --> 57:35.593
Huh?

57:35.613 --> 57:37.255
Walker Percy's uncle, his Uncle Will.

57:37.315 --> 57:39.197
I'm sorry, William Alexander Percy.

57:39.257 --> 57:41.320
That's Walker Percy's uncle.

57:41.340 --> 57:41.620
Yes.

57:41.660 --> 57:42.762
So you said William Alexander Percy.

57:42.782 --> 57:43.202
Oh, I did?

57:43.322 --> 57:45.285
Yeah, but that happens to be Walker Percy's uncle.

57:46.025 --> 57:47.287
That's who brought up Walker Percy.

57:47.507 --> 57:47.948
Yes, yes.

57:48.028 --> 57:51.272
And furthermore, Faulkner had read one of William Alexander Percy's early books.

57:51.292 --> 57:52.533
Yeah, they liked each other.

57:52.573 --> 57:53.454
Yeah, they respected each other.

57:53.474 --> 57:54.135
Yes, they did.

57:54.536 --> 57:58.140
And so I thought, what a wonderful association copy.

57:58.627 --> 58:01.851
I've got all of Will Percy's books signed.

58:02.592 --> 58:02.912
Do you?

58:02.932 --> 58:05.515
Well, I have a very fine Walker Percy collection.

58:05.615 --> 58:06.496
Oh, wonderful.

58:06.516 --> 58:07.097
I love Walker Percy.

58:07.117 --> 58:08.478
Yeah, he's wonderful.

58:08.618 --> 58:09.680
Well, there you are now.

58:09.700 --> 58:10.841
That was the beginning of it.

58:11.201 --> 58:14.125
And that set off a chain reaction.

58:14.145 --> 58:21.033
Right after that, in 1976 then, I went to my first Faulkner and Yoknobutafa conference.

58:21.053 --> 58:23.115
They had started in 74 in Oxford.

58:23.348 --> 58:26.252
They were a tribute to Faulkner.

58:26.332 --> 58:30.076
It was a gathering for a week of Faulkner scholars who would lecture.

58:30.537 --> 58:33.420
I didn't go to the first two because I was a very shy person.

58:33.901 --> 58:35.503
I didn't want to be around people.

58:35.523 --> 58:42.792
The third one, by the time of the third one in 76, I thought, ah, I've just had an exhibit of Faulkner, and now I'm a real Faulknerian.

58:43.092 --> 58:45.054
Should we do for the sake of my typist?

58:45.074 --> 58:47.698
Y-O-K-N-A-P-A-T-A-W-P-H-A.

58:52.924 --> 58:52.984
OK.

58:53.588 --> 59:00.622
I went down there.

59:00.642 --> 59:01.567
Look at the pumpkins in the fields over there.

59:01.587 --> 59:01.828
That's nice.

59:01.848 --> 59:02.029
Go ahead.

59:02.313 --> 59:10.881
Oh, boy.

59:10.901 --> 59:16.986
I'll tell you what I did.

59:17.006 --> 59:18.608
You're not going to believe what I did.

59:18.628 --> 59:21.791
I'm not going to even tell you what I did, but I did something so wrong.

59:21.811 --> 59:24.093
I was shooting the shit with you so much, I've done something just terrible.

59:24.113 --> 59:24.473
You missed a turn.

59:24.493 --> 59:25.394
I did miss a turn, and I never missed a turn.

59:25.414 --> 59:26.575
We're going to get out of here a little late.

59:26.595 --> 59:26.715
Sorry.

59:26.735 --> 59:27.236
Ah, that's just too much.

59:27.256 --> 59:28.136
This was a real psychological thing.

59:28.157 --> 59:28.757
It's only 9 o'clock, you know.

59:28.777 --> 59:28.977
It's fine.

59:28.997 --> 59:29.418
Oh, it's fine anyway.

59:29.438 --> 59:30.919
But I did something I really, I'm going to lose this about a half an hour.

59:32.300 --> 59:34.743
I like it.

59:34.763 --> 59:35.124
It's great.

59:35.184 --> 59:36.406
I'll tell you why, though.

59:36.426 --> 59:37.647
Well, I'll tell you why I like it, too.

59:37.667 --> 59:40.371
We're going to stop in my favorite little town, Farmington, Missouri.

59:40.391 --> 59:42.855
I'll tell you why I did this.

59:42.975 --> 59:44.557
I must have driven from Farmington to St.

59:44.637 --> 59:45.138
Louis and St.

59:45.158 --> 59:50.886
Louis back and written so many thousands of poems on this little drive we're doing now that I can do it blindfolded.

59:51.286 --> 59:53.810
We're now only about 10 minutes from Farmington.

59:53.830 --> 59:54.971
I should have stayed on 55.

59:55.973 --> 59:59.117
Instead, I took the Farmington turnoff unconsciously.

59:59.435 --> 01:00:22.489
We're now heading to the home I lived in for 18 years where Carl Peterson visited, where I put together the Faulkner collection. I've only been in St. Louis for five years and I feel real dislocated. I lived in this little town for many many years. It was out of here that I did all my correspondence that I did all my traveling to put the Faulkner collection together. So the collection really is physically pretty close to where it was put together? Indeed it is. It's within an hour and a half yeah

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:23.531
Yes, it is.

01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:25.693
And it's in Missouri, which pleases me very much.

01:00:25.753 --> 01:00:26.974
There is an appositeness to that.

01:00:27.175 --> 01:00:29.337
There is, because I'm a Missourian.

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:30.578
I wanted to keep it in Missouri.

01:00:30.598 --> 01:00:31.539
I thought about Columbia.

01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:36.164
It would have been better, more prestigious than SEMO, the Southeast Missouri State.

01:00:36.725 --> 01:00:38.327
But I don't have any affiliations.

01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:40.529
I thought about Washington U. You might ask me why not.

01:00:40.649 --> 01:00:42.571
It's a wonderful school.

01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:46.215
And the same thing I got at Washington U that I got at Yale.

01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:52.781
was a real sense of arrogance from the people who run those libraries.

01:00:52.801 --> 01:01:02.128
Somehow, in their own jobs, which aren't trivial by any extent, but are certainly, how shall I put it, curatorial at best.

01:01:02.497 --> 01:01:04.440
They're not real innovative for the most part.

01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:14.517
Those people are lacking, the kinds of people I dealt with, lacking in sufficient innovativeness to say, well, yes, we can acquire this collection if we can do this, that, and the other.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:17.302
Now, Southeast Missouri State was innovative.

01:01:17.322 --> 01:01:19.706
The way they got the collection, they got it in a number of ways.

01:01:20.367 --> 01:01:23.172
Part of the way they got it was by making me curator.
