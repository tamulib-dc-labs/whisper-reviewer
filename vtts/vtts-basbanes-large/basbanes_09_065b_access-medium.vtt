WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:04.669
We had opening a letter every morning.

00:04.949 --> 00:07.734
Every morning, and, and, well, why don't we do that?

00:07.754 --> 00:10.578
I think that you're supposed to eat beans every Saturday.

00:10.859 --> 00:11.760
I mean, that's true.

00:11.980 --> 00:13.363
Not to eat beans.

00:13.383 --> 00:15.366
You're supposed to eat beans every Saturday.

00:15.386 --> 00:20.554
And at any rate, the maid spoke to his wife.

00:20.753 --> 00:22.996
Somebody happened to go to the oatmeal and so and so on.

00:23.277 --> 00:24.799
I don't know what to do about it, what to say.

00:25.179 --> 00:30.287
And then, finally, his wife told him, he said, that's all right, because I never liked oatmeal.

00:30.587 --> 00:32.029
And that's typical of Bostonians.

00:32.270 --> 00:35.755
There are many things that you do because you're supposed to.

00:35.935 --> 00:38.439
You're supposed to.

00:38.459 --> 00:49.174
But earlier, when we came in, you were talking about there was really a person that you modeled, the character in your book, that you were trying to get rid of, that had come and caused some trouble on the vineyard away.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.609
a socialite from Boston.

00:51.629 --> 00:51.970
Yes, yes.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.935
And you had modeled one of the characters in your book after.

00:55.955 --> 01:01.023
Did there was someone here that you tried to kind of... Well, I never will know this.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.005
My mother's light-skinned, as I told you.

01:03.526 --> 01:07.712
And I don't know, and the light was on because I was someplace else.

01:07.832 --> 01:16.204
I will never know whether or not because my mother was light-skinned, she might have thought my mother was light and told her things that she would not have said.

01:16.224 --> 01:18.688
And the reason she came over to my mother's house,

01:18.820 --> 01:20.919
over here was because she saw a light.

01:21.827 --> 01:23.481
And she wanted to buy off the telephone.

01:24.018 --> 01:26.481
And my mother was very, well, it's half explained.

01:26.702 --> 01:33.952
The woman was younger than my mother, and I was not here, of course, but I rather imagine my mother said, well, you don't want to do that here, and so forth and so on.

01:33.972 --> 01:35.774
And I think I said, well, never know.

01:35.795 --> 01:41.142
I think that maybe she thought my mother was white and could, and therefore was nice.

01:41.222 --> 01:43.866
If my mother was not white, it's interesting.

01:43.886 --> 01:48.713
She was golden-skinned, but very often, white people would think that they're not black that you're white.

01:48.733 --> 01:49.774
Do you know what I mean?

01:50.775 --> 01:53.299
Oh, you do understand.

01:54.629 --> 01:56.472
Shades are very important.

01:56.853 --> 02:00.719
Before, I never really thought about shades of color, but you, the butternut child.

02:00.739 --> 02:01.019
Yes.

02:03.203 --> 02:03.783
It's so beautiful.

02:03.803 --> 02:04.024
Oh, really?

02:04.044 --> 02:05.186
It pleased me so much.

02:05.206 --> 02:06.768
Because you will never know how much stuff.

02:06.788 --> 02:10.113
Because, as I tell you, a double day has made me see my lips.

02:10.394 --> 02:12.597
You will never know how much stuff I went through.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.101
But please, don't listen to me, darling, now.

02:15.442 --> 02:17.044
Because now I'm so happy about it.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.388
Because I'm...

02:19.908 --> 02:26.577
You can see the gradations of differences if you're not afraid to look.

02:26.597 --> 02:27.118
All right.

02:27.158 --> 02:32.485
The tree that was an item to make for you, I thought that was a wonderful addition to the book.

02:32.505 --> 02:32.926
All right.

02:33.006 --> 02:34.027
I enjoyed that.

02:34.048 --> 02:35.770
I referred back to that afterwards.

02:35.850 --> 02:37.452
Beautiful flowers, by the way.

02:37.552 --> 02:38.233
An admirer?

02:38.634 --> 02:39.215
I don't know.

02:39.715 --> 02:41.858
Somebody had got those yesterday.

02:43.461 --> 02:46.725
She couldn't remember because he said they were beautiful.

02:46.925 --> 02:51.813
They definitely sent me, like that, in this small house, the place to put them.

02:52.154 --> 02:52.374
Yeah.

02:54.297 --> 02:55.640
Oh, you like this one?

02:55.760 --> 02:58.825
Right here, where do you do your writing?

02:58.845 --> 03:02.130
Oh, well, I usually, I have used this room now.

03:02.351 --> 03:07.059
I've used this room, but usually I wrote in, but you don't realize that.

03:07.079 --> 03:10.104
That's called a sun column, that room right there.

03:10.384 --> 03:12.628
But my point is, that's one of the early,

03:12.777 --> 03:18.587
But they don't make them anymore, because they're hot.

03:19.228 --> 03:20.089
Do you see what I'm saying?

03:20.370 --> 03:22.533
So that now, yeah.

03:23.515 --> 03:27.762
And then you'd want to sit in there in the summertime.

03:27.782 --> 03:30.927
But that's an extra room, because that's enough.

03:31.809 --> 03:35.335
I would like to get a picture of you sitting in that chair before we leave, too.

03:35.375 --> 03:39.021
All right, and it's so interesting, because I can't really put the chairs there.

03:40.385 --> 03:51.161
Tell me a little bit, relationships seem to be so important to you in your writing.

03:52.283 --> 03:56.208
Oh yes, because in the, in the, in the, yeah, it's so, it's so interesting.

03:56.549 --> 04:01.336
The color, that color is so interesting because I, uh, it just so happens.

04:01.356 --> 04:04.501
I think, I think maybe I had no feeling about color.

04:04.821 --> 04:07.405
I mean, you know, I never, I had no feeling about my skin.

04:07.874 --> 04:13.624
You see, because I come from them, so I'm mixed up, and so on, so that, but because I'm brown, doesn't make me think, who do they think they are?

04:13.644 --> 04:29.713
Because I never will forget, I was with a brown-skinned woman, and these particular friends that I'm talking about, I've known them for about six generations, and the one girl is very blind, and she's blue-eyed, and she's blonde, and when I look at her, I don't see her blue eyes, but I see her.

04:30.284 --> 04:38.217
that she had a sister with my best friend, and she had red hair and golden skin, and so and so on, and very beautiful, and when I look at her, I just see her.

04:38.778 --> 04:48.674
So I was with a brown-skinned woman, and I went by to talk to, oh, and the brown one was the younger one, and it's just the boss there.

04:49.074 --> 04:51.138
All right, so now she's the boss.

04:51.418 --> 04:55.785
All right, so therefore, I came to get her sister,

04:56.086 --> 05:05.437
And she said, Dorothy, my sister just came, and she's tired, and I said, she loved me, because when she was a little girl, her sister didn't want to take her.

05:05.477 --> 05:08.320
She wanted to go to Boston sometimes, but I said, I'll take her to the Boston.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.483
So she loved me there, this girl.

05:10.683 --> 05:13.546
I didn't see anything, because when she looks at me, she doesn't see my color.

05:13.787 --> 05:15.549
When I look at her, I don't see her color.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.471
Do you understand what I'm saying?

05:17.551 --> 05:18.432
And so that was that.

05:18.496 --> 05:21.844
And she said, no, Darcy, because I want my sister to die and so on.

05:21.864 --> 05:22.806
And we walked away.

05:23.227 --> 05:26.294
And it surprised me because I had no feeling about things like that.

05:26.314 --> 05:30.504
She said, she was talking about Darcy with her blue eyes and her blonde hair and so on.

05:30.744 --> 05:31.707
Who does she think she is?

05:32.007 --> 05:34.513
And I was shocked because I didn't see her tell her.

05:35.033 --> 05:45.906
And I think that's why so many people like me, like skinned people, because I don't, because I don't, well, now I'm going to tell you this right here, but go on while you ask the question.

05:46.407 --> 05:53.876
Well, just to go back to the question I asked a few minutes ago, and you mentioned about how you're born, that's in the paper, you marry, that's in the paper.

05:54.737 --> 06:01.285
But I guess the question that I asked is how you want, how you would like people to remember you.

06:01.305 --> 06:02.627
How would you like to be remembered?

06:05.307 --> 06:06.048
All right.

06:07.009 --> 06:10.714
I want you to feel, to know, not have a sense of humor about myself.

06:11.274 --> 06:11.755
We were taught.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.178
You'd better learn to laugh, little girl.

06:14.198 --> 06:15.780
I can hear my mother saying that.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.662
You'd better learn to laugh, little girl.

06:17.682 --> 06:18.523
I was my serious child.

06:19.124 --> 06:21.047
And I like life.

06:21.747 --> 06:22.548
And I love people.

06:23.490 --> 06:29.016
Because as I told you, everything that was not human, I was afraid of.

06:29.036 --> 06:31.580
I don't know why, but I don't know.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.542
I just happened to be a people lover.

06:34.366 --> 06:37.790
I mean, people talk and so forth, and I just love people.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.014
And many people don't like people, and I love people.

06:41.615 --> 06:42.216
I like animals.

06:42.236 --> 06:46.100
I'm beginning to get used to it because I wouldn't protect an animal.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.462
I was afraid of cats.

06:47.522 --> 06:48.664
How many cats do you have?

06:48.724 --> 06:49.304
They have me.

06:50.125 --> 06:50.306
Right?

06:50.586 --> 06:52.348
Because my mother fed everything.

06:53.449 --> 06:56.253
And so, therefore, when a cat comes, they'll have a cat upstairs.

06:56.693 --> 06:59.176
But I took the broom, and she's 12 years old.

06:59.256 --> 07:00.838
She's been with me about 10 years now.

07:01.599 --> 07:03.782
And I went back and said, all right, you win.

07:03.998 --> 07:05.442
How many cats?

07:05.462 --> 07:06.023
Is that one?

07:06.204 --> 07:09.372
No, she's an upstairs cat.

07:09.392 --> 07:13.422
And therefore, there are four more kittens.

07:13.562 --> 07:15.527
No, no, no, they don't have kittens anymore.

07:15.659 --> 07:18.443
And it's interesting because I knew you were coming.

07:18.503 --> 07:20.386
I was fussing nothing to you or anything.

07:20.686 --> 07:23.110
Because I've got cat food and cats all over the place.

07:23.130 --> 07:24.031
You know what I mean?

07:24.051 --> 07:25.433
And I was so mad with the cats.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.115
If you weren't here, I wouldn't have to do it.

07:27.135 --> 07:28.978
I was cleaning up and so forth and so on.

07:29.439 --> 07:33.544
And when it gets cold, I'd let them come in and they'd go in there.

07:33.625 --> 07:38.491
And I'm so afraid they're going to camp right now.

07:38.511 --> 07:39.773
Oh, the neighbors.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.815
We did see quite a cat outside.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.357
It looked like, you know, the house.

07:42.377 --> 07:42.697
Oh, right.

07:42.878 --> 07:45.261
There was a big gray cat.

07:45.528 --> 07:49.754
So you must be quite a celebrity on the island now with your book coming out.

07:50.274 --> 07:51.276
Well, in a way.

07:51.356 --> 07:54.280
But you see, we're not like that on the island.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.042
Isn't that interesting?

07:56.062 --> 07:57.144
Now, they know all about me.

07:57.985 --> 07:58.926
I'm sure they do.

07:59.487 --> 08:01.330
But isn't that interesting?

08:01.430 --> 08:01.690
No.

08:01.850 --> 08:06.697
Are they going to have a book signing for you at the bookstore here?

08:06.717 --> 08:07.778
Well, I was very fortunate.

08:07.798 --> 08:09.240
They were going to have a book signing.

08:09.781 --> 08:14.067
And then about two weeks ago, the book came out.

08:14.283 --> 08:23.498
And the woman who owned the bookstore had me come and sign about, oh, I don't know, about 200 copies.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.223
Do you go out that way when you leave?

08:26.243 --> 08:27.264
We know the story, yeah.

08:27.465 --> 08:32.974
Oh, because on that day, I didn't see them because then I left.

08:33.354 --> 08:35.398
She put them in the front window.

08:35.418 --> 08:37.161
I mean, the whole front window.

08:37.501 --> 08:41.067
What was that book you see?

08:41.452 --> 08:45.839
I don't know whether they... How does it feel?

08:45.859 --> 08:50.106
You're 87 years old, and here you have your second novel.

08:50.206 --> 08:51.548
How do you feel?

08:51.628 --> 08:56.055
Is there a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, pleasure?

08:57.157 --> 08:58.099
How do you feel seen?

08:58.680 --> 09:01.745
You're here with two copies of your book.

09:01.765 --> 09:02.866
Please.

09:02.906 --> 09:08.235
The only thing about it is I told you, don't forget I'm an old Bostonian, and when I say that, I really mean that.

09:08.502 --> 09:16.191
I'm talking about 70 years ago, when you... I tell you, when my mother took out, you're supposed to... Oh, this is the thing that I love.

09:16.372 --> 09:18.074
Look, I've got my legs crossed, as you know.

09:18.374 --> 09:22.359
But the point is, you're supposed to do that to your legs.

09:22.379 --> 09:34.093
And then I see the poor actresses, and I say to them, you should have gone to my dances, because it wasn't really dances, it was part of dances, because the little boys bow to you, and you did the little kissy, and you crossed the head.

09:34.314 --> 09:36.957
But I find myself doing that now, too.

09:37.207 --> 09:38.369
Because I know those women.

09:38.389 --> 09:38.870
They're women.

09:38.890 --> 09:40.091
They were tired.

09:40.111 --> 09:45.459
I mean, to get where they got, they had to be 40 or 45 when they got there, you see.

09:45.480 --> 09:52.290
And I know that they're not comfortable, but they make them... Can I ask you to sit in that chair and sign a couple of these books?

09:52.310 --> 09:52.991
Well, of course.

09:53.031 --> 09:58.079
And I can take some pictures of you with the book, and that way we can do a couple of things.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.045
I'd like you to inscribe this to my wife.

10:02.065 --> 10:02.445
All right.

10:03.827 --> 10:04.328
I'll give you that.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.814
I think there's a... How about sitting in that nice yellow chair in there?

10:08.715 --> 10:08.896
Where?

10:08.916 --> 10:10.237
Oh, all right.

10:10.337 --> 10:11.199
All right.

10:12.881 --> 10:14.042
No, no, no, that's all right.

10:14.062 --> 10:14.563
I'll tell you.

10:14.723 --> 10:22.694
No, I... And I think that... You see, because now you've seen the doctor... Come on in.

10:23.755 --> 10:24.797
Do you need a pen, Miss West?

10:25.918 --> 10:27.060
Oh, I got one for you.

10:27.140 --> 10:27.721
I got one for you.

10:27.921 --> 10:29.463
I got one for you right here.

10:29.483 --> 10:30.965
This young woman's name is Connie.

10:33.068 --> 10:33.268
Thank you.

10:34.970 --> 10:39.036
Oh, it's your choice.

10:39.176 --> 10:40.698
It's your book.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.122
It's wherever you would like to sign it.

10:43.182 --> 10:48.450
Now, while you're doing that, I'm going to... Right.

10:48.470 --> 11:00.508
And look, today is... Today is February the 8th.

11:00.528 --> 11:00.628
Four.

11:02.851 --> 11:03.492
Five, actually.

11:03.978 --> 11:10.627
Oh, that's why I was asking you to help me with that.

11:10.647 --> 11:12.009
And let me get in, darling.

11:12.029 --> 11:13.231
Connie, C-O-N-N-I-E.

11:13.251 --> 11:31.656
C-O-N-N-I-E.

11:39.263 --> 11:43.668
Oh, that's right.

11:43.748 --> 11:44.809
Look at me and smile.

11:46.391 --> 11:47.031
A pretty smile.

11:47.392 --> 11:52.537
I can't... Oh, yes, you can.

11:52.557 --> 11:59.725
No, that was the thing that my mother liked about me so much, because I was not the beauty of the family, and she thought I was so good, such a great child.

12:04.770 --> 12:05.151
Okay, good.

12:06.432 --> 12:09.135
That's the only thing that I don't like.

12:09.335 --> 12:09.956
Yeah.

12:09.996 --> 12:13.641
And I'm just going to ask you to sign this way.

12:13.681 --> 12:14.983
I don't want to have to.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.525
I'm Nick, if you want to sign one.

12:16.665 --> 12:19.009
Oh, oh, this is for you.

12:19.189 --> 12:20.571
That's for Connie, and that's for me.

12:22.113 --> 12:23.395
Do you know there's a thing in there?

12:24.497 --> 12:24.797
Yes.

12:25.818 --> 12:26.379
All right.

12:26.559 --> 12:27.601
This is my bookmark.

12:28.562 --> 12:29.343
Now, this is, wait a minute.

12:29.363 --> 12:30.825
Let me get the date straight again.

12:31.426 --> 12:32.608
It's the 8th of February.

12:37.634 --> 12:47.143
Do I get rid of that chair?

12:47.163 --> 12:50.192
I'm Nick, as in Nicholas, right?

13:28.833 --> 13:45.901
The woman is always in my life.

13:45.921 --> 13:54.074
That's great.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.937
Let me give you a little, just look at me a little bit.

13:58.870 --> 14:02.413
Now, if you want to just close the book, and then we can see the dust jacket, too.

14:02.473 --> 14:03.875
Is this the dust jacket?

14:03.895 --> 14:04.415
Yeah.

14:04.495 --> 14:04.716
All right.

14:05.216 --> 14:06.057
You have to hold it up.

14:06.317 --> 14:07.718
I think you do not have to hold it up.

14:07.738 --> 14:09.600
Just hold it in your lap clothes like that.

14:09.660 --> 14:10.261
All right, both of them?

14:10.701 --> 14:11.282
Yeah, fine.

14:11.322 --> 14:12.903
And I'll just take that pen out of your hand.

14:12.943 --> 14:14.825
Don't get to me.

14:14.965 --> 14:16.367
Did I tell you about this woman?

14:17.608 --> 14:17.848
No.

14:18.749 --> 14:19.309
Please go ahead.

14:20.130 --> 14:28.438
Because a friend of mine saw a white woman, he was in maybe in London, saw a white woman sitting like this.

14:29.920 --> 14:34.624
was, for some reason, attracted to her pose and made her a brown woman.

14:36.586 --> 14:42.952
Then, The Living is Easy was published by the English Company.

14:44.734 --> 14:50.719
And with my mother's picture, well, not my mother's picture, but some beautiful black woman, colored woman, on the cover.

14:51.340 --> 14:55.263
For some reason, they liked this, that's it, and chose it.

14:55.283 --> 14:57.025
Then, when double dates in it,

14:57.578 --> 14:59.241
They like that picture, too.

14:59.561 --> 15:01.103
It's a beautiful picture.

15:02.085 --> 15:03.848
It's a wonderful cover.

15:03.908 --> 15:05.170
It's a beautiful picture.

15:05.190 --> 15:09.216
Oh, right, because when I first saw it... Did you like it when you first saw it?

15:09.236 --> 15:12.461
No, the reason it bothered me, I think, was a little sensitivity in me.

15:12.902 --> 15:14.304
But it's because of that?

15:14.364 --> 15:17.048
Well, because most of the people were light-skinned.

15:17.068 --> 15:25.341
And I felt, because there are many white people who feel that way, I felt that they did this dark skin because they did not believe

15:25.726 --> 15:27.288
And they were light-skinned people, didn't they?

15:27.308 --> 15:30.832
And the reason, you would be surprised how many color people talk for white.

15:31.273 --> 15:33.135
I was sitting at the picture here, do you, sir?

15:34.217 --> 15:36.600
Oh, everybody looks at that beginning.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.362
I couldn't understand why they looked at it.

15:38.802 --> 15:43.368
And then I realized that children don't have to go to parties anymore.

15:43.528 --> 15:44.850
I say beautiful girls.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.312
Girls don't want to wear a dress.

15:46.332 --> 15:47.193
I have two daughters.

15:47.874 --> 15:50.116
Isn't that interesting?

15:50.156 --> 15:52.359
They've all got ribbons in their hair.

15:52.379 --> 15:53.921
But my point is, this one is my niece.

15:53.941 --> 15:55.463
My little nephew wouldn't put it there.

15:55.831 --> 16:11.867
We have to leave, Miss West.

16:13.849 --> 16:19.055
We have to go catch the boat.

16:19.075 --> 16:20.356
Oh, you had your own car?

16:20.376 --> 16:20.556
Yeah.

16:20.890 --> 16:21.872
Oh.

16:21.892 --> 16:25.117
And unfortunately, there was only one resolution.

16:25.237 --> 16:28.543
It was either 1.15, 1.45, or 4 o'clock.

16:28.583 --> 16:29.324
This is a little picture.

16:29.344 --> 16:31.167
I never played with a doll.

16:31.187 --> 16:33.371
I wanted, always wanted a real baby.

16:33.651 --> 16:34.913
You wanted a real baby?

16:37.037 --> 16:37.698
Why?

16:37.758 --> 16:39.361
Yeah, I never, I never, I never talked.

16:39.381 --> 16:39.882
This is the boy.

16:39.902 --> 16:42.166
I want to get her on the table.

16:42.186 --> 16:43.067
Let's know it's worth it.
