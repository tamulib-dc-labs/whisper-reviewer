WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:02.850
Let me pronounce your name.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.653
It's Decha, right?

00:05.673 --> 00:06.154
Decha.

00:06.374 --> 00:06.795
Decha.

00:06.815 --> 00:07.095
Decha.

00:07.696 --> 00:09.598
And your surname is?

00:09.618 --> 00:10.379
It's Boller.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.201
B-O-L-E-R.

00:11.461 --> 00:11.601
Right.

00:11.621 --> 00:12.222
Is that Dutch?

00:12.642 --> 00:14.805
No, but my maiden name is Brookman.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.548
I see.

00:16.848 --> 00:18.430
But I kept one of my married names.

00:18.510 --> 00:18.911
Okay.

00:19.672 --> 00:29.785
So before I put on the tape recorder, he was saying, well, why don't you, you were about to say something about Mr. Coulter, I guess.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.881
What was it?

00:33.103 --> 01:00.379
Oh, what there might have been of democratic process at the Library Commission when I first began going to those meetings about a year ago has been systematically, deliberately eroded

01:00.612 --> 01:20.679
All I can think is that his notion of governance comes from a CEO point of view, and he has no comprehension or interest in or actual perhaps hostility toward a democratic process.

01:21.400 --> 01:30.332
So his claim of being concerned about the public is to dismiss the public that does attend, whom he treats

01:30.532 --> 01:36.020
Oh, I'll tell you some of the places where it is, is when I work some of them now.

01:39.506 --> 01:41.849
The gadflies, of course, that's tame.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.151
The gadflies.

01:43.672 --> 01:46.677
You are dismissively referred to as the gadflies.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.064
Not you specifically.

01:51.084 --> 01:57.033
I mean, your name doesn't come up, I certainly would, but you're talking generically of the people who come to the meetings.

01:57.574 --> 01:58.395
Troublemakers.

01:58.460 --> 02:11.499
So he needs to maintain his own sense of security in his position and his illusion to himself that he's conducting a democratic process.

02:12.140 --> 02:15.945
What he does is to tell us that we are not the public.

02:15.965 --> 02:17.127
The public isn't there.

02:17.848 --> 02:21.473
And so he's paying attention to the real public that isn't there.

02:22.234 --> 02:27.842
And perhaps he feels he has this army of contributors that he shook down for

02:28.312 --> 02:30.236
of the Library Foundation.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.061
Maybe he thinks they are the public.

02:34.544 --> 02:49.712
But the two major things that he did in the course of his frustrations of being able to get his way at the meetings is to limit the public comment to three minutes, which, you know, makes a mangled mess of things you can't really

02:51.380 --> 02:55.626
get a point across with these little chopped up three minutes.

02:55.646 --> 02:57.208
But he affected that early on.

02:57.529 --> 03:09.846
But the last thing he did was to change the bylaws—actually, for both of them, he had to change the bylaws—change the bylaws to strip the minutes down to less than was on the agenda.

03:11.148 --> 03:19.800
He stripped it down so that only action items need to be reported, and all that's reported of that is the name of the item,

03:21.704 --> 03:26.228
The vote taken and the total on the vote.

03:26.529 --> 03:28.611
Nothing about what anybody said.

03:29.512 --> 03:32.134
It doesn't even have to mention that there's public comment.

03:33.375 --> 03:48.150
Well, on an action item, it mentions that the public speaks in favor or against it, not with any detail, just spoke in favor of the motion or against it with the name of the person who spoke.

03:49.514 --> 03:59.426
And there's been repeated, like at the last five maybe meetings, four or five, objection to this process.

03:59.486 --> 04:07.615
And it's finally, finally we got some commissioners to refuse to approve the minutes in that form any longer.

04:07.655 --> 04:12.121
And so now it's going to be reconsidered.

04:12.161 --> 04:15.825
But he'll drive his feet on that.

04:16.379 --> 04:19.924
I think that's what he said, yeah.

04:20.124 --> 04:25.212
But I don't know—I've been trying to find out if that guarantees he'll be off the commission.

04:25.232 --> 04:30.539
No, he didn't see—in fact, he said his term as president is up, and I think his term goes through 99.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.643
Oh, I see.

04:32.663 --> 04:33.404
That's what he said.

04:33.704 --> 04:38.471
And I, by the way, was at the nominating committee meeting.

04:38.491 --> 04:42.657
I, one member of the press, and one

04:44.324 --> 04:46.487
elderly man who stopped coming now.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.630
He was just a person unto himself.

04:48.910 --> 04:55.619
All he would do is he'd get up and very politely ask that the hours of the library be extended time after time.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.461
That's what he would say.

04:58.403 --> 05:13.082
So we were the only three people in the room when he was nominated for president, and I got up and I talked about conflict of interest, and there were only two members of the commission at that meeting putting in the nomination.

05:13.366 --> 05:22.722
Fran Streets, who isn't attending the meetings anymore—she was the vice president—she had withdrawn her name from the nomination the day before.

05:22.742 --> 05:27.230
So his was the only one that was in the ring.

05:28.312 --> 05:31.798
But they hotly defended him and, oh, there's no conflict of interest.

05:31.858 --> 05:32.579
But there I was.

05:32.599 --> 05:37.888
I said what I could.

05:38.678 --> 05:39.639
What are the hours?

05:39.679 --> 05:42.323
What time do they get closed now, America?

05:42.383 --> 05:57.041
Well, I think sometimes they stay open till eight, other times till six.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.486
That's one of the conflicts with the Library Foundation.

06:00.526 --> 06:06.053
The Library Foundation is not allowed to run any events during the open hours of the library.

06:06.910 --> 06:32.301
But they raise money by scheduling events in the library, and the only reporting of monies that we can get out of the foundation, and the rest of the time they say, we're a private non-profit, we don't have to tell you nothing, so we don't see their annual budget, but we do get a report every six months on the events cost.

06:32.561 --> 06:35.905
The cost, the expenses, and the

06:36.526 --> 06:41.853
taken and what presumably the library has gotten from it.

06:41.913 --> 07:03.900
But at any rate, the possibility of having longer hours in the library is restricted by the continuing desire of the Library Foundation to have as many hours available to them for their events as possible.

07:04.825 --> 07:08.210
There was a wild thing happened here, June 20th.

07:08.730 --> 07:20.806
They closed the library Friday, all day Friday, with no prior announcement for the United States Mayor's Conference.

07:22.188 --> 07:33.904
They were having a party there that night, and I was with my tape recorder at the doors taping people's reaction to not being able to get in the library, and there were many irate people.

07:35.420 --> 07:44.909
But anyway, that somehow was—that was arranged somehow through the foundation and the mayor.

07:44.969 --> 07:52.516
I think the mayor took some initiative there and just said how it had to be, and we witnessed the commission rubber stamping it.

07:56.300 --> 08:04.988
Anyway, that's all the stuff I've been sucked into knowing about.

08:06.672 --> 08:17.610
As a result of my learning about, I don't know, a year and a half ago, that they were January 1995, was it?

08:21.716 --> 08:23.639
My sense of time is eroding.

08:23.659 --> 08:24.461
Well, this is 97.

08:24.561 --> 08:26.704
The library opened in April of 96.

08:27.566 --> 08:32.173
Okay, so it was in January of 96 that we learned that

08:33.689 --> 08:43.378
Some large number of books had been taken to the—library books had been taken to the landfill by Department of Public Works trucks.

08:43.498 --> 08:45.940
And he claims to have had no knowledge of that, by the way.

08:46.821 --> 08:47.922
And I said, well, who audited it?

08:48.062 --> 08:49.283
Did you do an investigation?

08:50.564 --> 08:54.368
And he said, yeah, but we—it's all this finger-pointing.

08:54.408 --> 09:02.515
I said, you know—I said, I'm not from San Francisco, but it seems to me—I said to him, and it's on the paper—I said, I'm an old investigative reporter.

09:02.765 --> 09:06.452
But that would be pretty easy to find out who told the trucks to come.

09:07.073 --> 09:10.078
I mean, that should be pretty find-outable.

09:10.238 --> 09:17.732
You know, you should be able to determine who ordered the truck drivers to come and get this stuff.

09:17.752 --> 09:20.457
And he said he didn't have an answer to that.

09:20.597 --> 09:22.460
And he smiled, you know.

09:23.181 --> 09:24.604
And then I said to him,

09:26.137 --> 09:27.478
Yeah, very interesting.

09:27.498 --> 09:31.222
I mean, anyway, I'm sorry, I don't want to talk, but I want you to talk.

09:31.242 --> 09:34.645
Well, that's interesting to me.

09:34.665 --> 09:52.001
Well, no, no, what he said was, he's even suggesting that it was sabotaged by the librarians that ordered those books, that because they are a union and they don't want volunteer work, that they somehow made it impossible for the books to get onto the shelves.

09:52.201 --> 09:54.523
I mean, this is what he suggested to me today.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.964
I'm going to quote him on this.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.766
You know, it's ridiculous.

10:01.950 --> 10:05.093
You know, when people say things like this, they don't help themselves.

10:05.854 --> 10:08.337
Because I quote people very, very accurately, you know.

10:10.739 --> 10:11.761
Well, that's interesting.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.565
How could the librarians possibly?

10:15.585 --> 10:17.487
I mean, they believe in saving books.

10:17.787 --> 10:20.050
And then I said, well, where would you have put them anyway?

10:20.070 --> 10:24.394
I mean, clearly you don't have the shelf space for them.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.776
You know, something was going on.

10:26.448 --> 10:28.550
What happened there?

10:28.590 --> 10:36.879
And he said, well, they had a mayor, Jordan, who took X amount of dollars out.

10:36.900 --> 10:40.744
And then he said, that took away three and a half or four acres of space.

10:40.764 --> 10:45.509
And so that was the shelf space that they were going to have that would have accommodated those books.

10:46.590 --> 10:49.694
And I said, well, that took away so much of the building.

10:49.754 --> 10:52.657
I said, but you didn't have to build all the light, all that.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.699
And when I walk in there, it's a beautiful building.

10:55.460 --> 10:56.421
I said, but my first

10:56.705 --> 10:58.428
response was, where are the books?

10:59.149 --> 11:16.656
Look at all this space and all these wells and, you know, and he's, I mean, he built, you've got three hundred and, I don't know how many hundred thousand square feet you have there, but I don't see any, I don't see a single book out there in that building.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.001
So anyway, this is just me coming in from Massachusetts.

11:20.021 --> 11:25.429
You know, I've been looking at libraries all over the world, and I do have a sense of libraries I've

11:25.848 --> 11:31.615
fundamentally built to be repositories of books.

11:31.635 --> 11:34.319
Well, it's been repeatedly said that it's a party pad.

11:34.519 --> 11:41.128
I mean, that it's set up with a lot of open space, and they talk about clear sight lines and a lot of light.

11:41.608 --> 11:45.173
But what it makes possible is for them to do their money-raising events in this.

11:45.193 --> 11:45.934
But for what, though?

11:45.954 --> 11:47.896
What are they raising the goddamn money for?

11:48.177 --> 11:49.819
Pardon me.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.362
The glory of Steve Coulter.

11:53.287 --> 11:58.433
But I mean, if it's to raise money to buy new books— To buy new computers.

12:03.798 --> 12:04.279
Okay.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.201
That's what I see.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.944
I see computerization, privatization.

12:08.964 --> 12:22.298
And I can see how he believes that he is bringing the business acumen that he has to—of

12:22.953 --> 12:27.058
a city that doesn't know how to do anything, to a bunch of bureaucrats.

12:27.078 --> 12:29.882
He says that in this transcript, I made it as Jesus.

12:29.902 --> 12:33.507
The city, you know, doesn't put its money where its mouth is.

12:33.587 --> 12:40.015
And in fact, though, in San Francisco, not only did we vote the library bond— 78 percent.

12:40.036 --> 12:41.578
78 percent of the people voted for that.

12:41.738 --> 12:41.998
Right.

12:42.439 --> 12:52.572
And after that, a reserved percentage for fifteen years, I think, of the general fund for

12:53.108 --> 12:57.634
books, and accessibility to books, you know, open hours.

12:58.255 --> 13:07.186
So the Library Commission was forced to keep some of the branches open more than they had been, and to buy books.

13:07.266 --> 13:10.490
But they've done all kinds of fiddlings with the books, you know.

13:10.870 --> 13:16.838
He tells me they're spending three and a half, oh that's another reason they filled up so fast, because they've acquired so much.

13:18.725 --> 13:22.969
And it just filled up a lot faster than they ever expected it to.

13:23.149 --> 13:31.377
That's one of the claims that they have, but it's hard to put your hand on, okay, how many new books did you buy?

13:31.837 --> 13:33.419
I asked them that.

13:33.439 --> 13:34.279
Just give me an answer.

13:34.299 --> 13:36.361
Well, it all depends on what you call a book.

13:38.003 --> 13:39.985
In fact, what do you call a book?

13:40.685 --> 13:41.826
You tell me what a book is.

13:42.367 --> 13:45.930
It was a very interesting colloquy, you know.

13:46.332 --> 13:50.438
I'm kind of eager to get home to transcribe it, you know.

13:50.459 --> 13:50.679
We'll see.

13:50.919 --> 13:51.540
But go ahead.

13:51.761 --> 13:53.363
Really, I'm here to talk to you.

13:53.744 --> 13:55.366
Oops, I'm blabbering.

13:55.386 --> 13:56.127
You'll have to forgive me.

13:56.148 --> 13:58.071
I've been going all day.

13:59.072 --> 13:59.873
Okay.

14:01.256 --> 14:08.126
So I got dragged into this because of my outrage at them trashing books.

14:08.727 --> 14:10.130
Let's also fix ourselves.

14:10.951 --> 14:14.196
Here we are at 1182 Market Street.

14:14.429 --> 14:16.852
virtually abutting the new building.

14:17.092 --> 14:17.693
Right.

14:17.753 --> 14:19.635
So you're a member of the Grey Panthers.

14:19.735 --> 14:19.915
Right.

14:19.955 --> 14:23.299
Why don't you tell me briefly from my tape recorder what the Grey Panthers is?

14:24.441 --> 14:36.054
We're a social change organization, basically a—I can't think of the word now—advisory.

14:36.635 --> 14:43.423
An organization that works for

14:43.690 --> 15:06.614
progressive social change with the basic premise that age and youth need to bridge the gaps between each other and can work together to better understand the needs of a society and to achieve change that's beneficial to everybody.

15:06.634 --> 15:09.597
One of our sayings is,

15:10.100 --> 15:16.085
That we're working to make a world that everybody wants to grow old in.

15:21.390 --> 15:26.735
So we are a multi-issue organization, too.

15:26.795 --> 15:38.605
There's no issue—there are certain ones we're more interested in than others—environmental issues, economic justice.

15:40.019 --> 15:45.787
social justice, things like that.

15:46.067 --> 16:03.190
As far as the issue of the books goes, the connection there is that the books that are in our library collection were put there by older generations with presumably the expectation that they would come down to later generations.

16:04.192 --> 16:08.878
To me, it's particularly outrageous that older books are

16:10.225 --> 16:28.886
are seen as more expendable than newer books for some reason or another, maybe because older books are thought to be in not such good condition.

16:28.906 --> 16:33.370
But there's an awful lot of kind of modernist-type thought, which is, well, they're old.

16:33.671 --> 16:40.198
They don't count anymore.

16:40.583 --> 16:53.939
My experience puts the lie to—I've been exposed to a lot of books from this wild collection of books that have come my way, books that I would never have probably bothered looking at or reading because I've just been handling them.

16:54.640 --> 17:08.397
I've been taken aback at the experience of seeing how in a prior age people saw things.

17:08.984 --> 17:18.517
It's just the experience of being able to see their perspective before scientism specialized everything and broke it into little chunks.

17:19.879 --> 17:36.561
I've looked at books that see the questions with a broader view, and even though it may be dated according to scientific research that's happened since then, there's a lot of good

17:37.098 --> 17:55.140
And even if it's not right, historically it's valuable, you know, to know how thought was—what was being thought at an earlier time that is vanishing from our access.

17:56.285 --> 18:01.212
Did you consider yourself a library activist or anything prior to this discovery?

18:01.232 --> 18:02.233
No, no, I was not.

18:02.294 --> 18:04.517
Are you a book person?

18:04.677 --> 18:06.179
I'm a bit of a book person.

18:06.299 --> 18:08.442
I'm a social researcher.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.305
I was trained in social research.

18:10.325 --> 18:13.329
And where, just for the record, are you from here or are you from?

18:14.291 --> 18:16.774
I'm from around and about.

18:16.794 --> 18:18.537
I was born in Southern California.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.661
I did my teens in New York City.

18:21.701 --> 18:25.026
I went to college in Seattle, Washington.

18:25.225 --> 18:29.071
and then University of Chicago, and a little stint back in New York.

18:29.112 --> 18:50.187
And then basically I've been here since about 1958, though I moved out of the city up into Sonoma County, Marin County, in Sonoma County, for a number of years while I was raising my daughter, and then we came back to the city.

18:50.858 --> 19:15.988
I'm a kind of multi-issue person, but I had been working on keeping the nuclear power and weapons USS Missouri out of San Francisco Harbor, tenant issues, animal rights, formed an organization called Vigil for Animals where we protested— Vigil, V-I-G-I-L.

19:16.525 --> 19:29.797
We vigiled every Sunday for four years out at the Letterman Army Institute of Research where they used animals in experiments for weapons and chemical weapons, biological warfare.

19:30.057 --> 19:44.710
As a matter of fact, I was convinced that the Gulf War vets, part of what's wrong with them is that they got inoculated with serums and things.

19:44.909 --> 19:47.772
that had been tested on animals at Letterman.

19:50.435 --> 19:52.718
How do you spell Letterman?

19:52.738 --> 19:54.860
L-E-T-T-E-R-M-A-N.

19:55.101 --> 19:56.262
That's here in San Francisco?

19:56.602 --> 19:57.263
It's gone now.

19:57.463 --> 20:01.368
When they closed the—was it the Presidio Army Bay?

20:01.388 --> 20:01.988
Oh, it was at the Presidio.

20:02.569 --> 20:12.300
So when they closed that, they cleared it all out and moved those experiments to other places.

20:13.748 --> 20:31.455
So anyway, I had been involved in a variety of different things, but then some... I suspect that my family from Holland might have had books in their past, because it was like some invisible button got pushed.

20:32.396 --> 20:33.918
You don't throw away our books.

20:34.239 --> 20:40.448
It was just... So I went down there with a sign that said, I just...

20:40.765 --> 20:45.651
I've got a big piece of paper because I'm an activist, sat outside the door where they were giving away the books.

20:45.671 --> 20:48.594
And I said, discarding books is censorship.

20:48.675 --> 20:49.816
Stop the discards.

20:51.698 --> 20:54.421
Because they weren't keeping track of what books they were discarding.

20:54.702 --> 20:55.623
Well, they were in a panic.

20:56.444 --> 20:57.505
They had to get rid of it.

20:57.645 --> 21:00.048
This thing was a major problem here.

21:00.068 --> 21:04.073
They had no place to put them.

21:04.829 --> 21:08.252
I'm just guessing, as an outsider, they were in a panic.

21:08.272 --> 21:09.454
They didn't want anyone to know.

21:09.474 --> 21:24.329
They didn't have any place to put them either, which is probably why I believe at the orders of Dowlin, although I don't have any proof of that, why the books were sent packing.

21:24.989 --> 21:28.493
So then what happened was— How did you find out about it?

21:28.513 --> 21:30.234
Through the press?

21:31.976 --> 21:33.398
Not the Nick Baker piece.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.819
No, no.

21:35.947 --> 21:36.788
What are their names?

21:37.449 --> 21:41.135
It's two men's names.

21:41.936 --> 21:42.737
Edith Cedar.

21:43.138 --> 21:44.500
No, that's the name of the group.

21:44.660 --> 21:44.901
Yeah.

21:45.482 --> 21:50.349
No, it's not coming to mind.

21:50.930 --> 21:56.018
At any rate, it's a regular kind of byline column, expose.

21:56.098 --> 21:57.721
Oh, I see.

21:57.741 --> 22:03.169
And they expose this with a picture of a big mound of books.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.404
And everybody went crazy.

22:09.047 --> 22:34.894
So then what happened was Dallin, and I know he, I have tapes where he claims proudly to have designed the adopt-a-book program, which was to invite legitimate nonprofit groups to come and take as many books as they wanted, which to my mind did not solve the problem because the public was still losing their collections.

22:37.017 --> 22:42.603
Some people, that mollified them because they felt, okay, the books are still in existence.

22:43.344 --> 22:47.569
Maybe they are, maybe they aren't.

22:47.589 --> 22:53.135
Yeah, maybe they are and maybe they aren't.

22:53.555 --> 23:03.987
My sign didn't put a stop to it, though, so then I decided to take part in it and take as many books as I could and offer them back to the library.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.453
So how did you get the books?

23:05.573 --> 23:06.074
What did you do?

23:06.554 --> 23:08.076
Tell me physically what you did.

23:08.116 --> 23:14.224
Okay, well, they had appointment times that you could... Oh, so this was legitimate.

23:14.244 --> 23:15.806
You could come and just grab.

23:15.966 --> 23:16.486
Oh, yeah.

23:16.807 --> 23:18.008
Yeah, yeah.

23:18.269 --> 23:21.012
This was the period when they said just come and take the books.

23:21.713 --> 23:21.973
Yes.

23:22.093 --> 23:24.316
So you went... But it was restricted.

23:24.336 --> 23:31.425
You know, they'd make certain... The first go around, they had...

23:31.979 --> 23:36.989
an appointment list, and only a certain number of groups could come in at one time.

23:37.089 --> 23:41.899
And you would pick the books and put them in a carton and take them out to your car.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.646
And you could only be there for three hours or two hours, whatever it was.

23:47.851 --> 23:51.979
And they were very gracious and helped you carry them out to the car.

23:53.343 --> 24:08.244
That was the first time, and maybe the first two times, and what they did was to lay the books out on tables in the front room of the old main library, the door in the ante room where we used to check out the books.

24:10.807 --> 24:19.840
But then it loosened up a little and more groups came in and you didn't have an actual appointment time, and they were

24:20.056 --> 24:24.340
all on shelves in the basement of the Old Main Library.

24:33.510 --> 24:37.294
This is outside the basement.

24:37.715 --> 24:42.179
I took this because these are the chairs they were giving away.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.161
This is an old binder, I think.

24:44.281 --> 24:47.665
Oh, I thought they'd kill to have that.

24:47.705 --> 24:49.607
See, there's the auction signs on them.

24:50.245 --> 24:53.810
And these didn't sell, so they were jumped.

24:53.830 --> 24:58.055
Finally they found somebody who, I think, had some use for it.

24:59.117 --> 25:05.185
But a lot of the stuff they never, you know, like— This is equipment.

25:05.225 --> 25:08.669
These are book preservation issues.

25:08.689 --> 25:09.470
Yeah.

25:10.111 --> 25:19.003
So the picture I was looking for—well, this is taken in the room.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.290
I think it's developed backwards.

25:24.071 --> 25:24.612
Maybe not.

25:24.672 --> 25:25.913
Maybe I was standing at the front.

25:27.215 --> 25:36.667
It was a basement room, and the walls were lined with bookshelves, and then it was a huge room, so there were a lot of freestanding bookshelves all filled with books.

25:37.227 --> 25:39.971
But I took this because they also threw away all the records.

25:40.111 --> 25:49.362
And that enraged me because I thought they could have made at least tapes of the records, but that turns out to have been a copyright

25:49.898 --> 25:53.544
So they just dumped all of these records.

25:55.847 --> 26:18.201
I thought that forward-looking technology would be to recognize that the records may be becoming out of date because the technology that people have at home is for CDs or for cassettes, so that the library's function would be

26:18.451 --> 26:24.038
to provide a method to play LP records if they're into technology.

26:24.058 --> 26:43.783
As a matter of fact, I wonder why it wouldn't be the function of the library to provide access to computers that will be able to handle old disks as the upgrading happens.

26:44.523 --> 26:49.968
There's this sort of detritus behind it of stuff you can't access or use.

26:53.292 --> 26:56.235
Did you take any records, or just did you restrict yourself to books?

26:56.315 --> 26:57.276
I took a few records.

26:57.436 --> 26:59.157
I took a few.

26:59.178 --> 27:09.788
I was more interested in the books, but I took maybe about fifteen, twenty records.

27:10.173 --> 27:14.157
Taking the books was— Were they good records?

27:14.358 --> 27:16.340
Well, I remember one Paul Robeson record.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.041
They were in perfectly good shape.

27:18.762 --> 27:32.097
One of the effects of this endeavor has been to leave me with a seriously addled brain.

27:32.257 --> 27:38.003
It has been overexposed to too many separate little chunks of detail.

27:39.299 --> 27:44.747
Here's a copy of this.

27:44.767 --> 27:51.057
So I made an index card like this out for each of the books that we took.

27:51.077 --> 27:57.867
So this is Crouse, C-R-O-U-S-C, and Anglin, A-N-G-L-I-N, Automotive Engines, 1986.

27:58.167 --> 27:59.469
So that's not all that old.

27:59.489 --> 28:03.315
629.13.

28:03.633 --> 28:07.499
Next line, C884, lowercase aw, 1986.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.363
So that's the classification code for it.

28:10.383 --> 28:10.744
Right.

28:11.345 --> 28:13.909
And then this stands for Merced.

28:13.949 --> 28:15.992
That's the branch that it was in.

28:16.032 --> 28:22.382
And then I looked them up on the computer, and it said withdrawn from that branch.

28:22.943 --> 28:25.066
So in this case— WD.

28:25.206 --> 28:25.366
WD.

28:25.967 --> 28:31.716
In this case, there was a record of it having been there and been withdrawn.

28:32.354 --> 28:36.840
There was no record that this book had been removed from the collection.

28:37.200 --> 28:42.787
I mean, you didn't look up the book and see that that copy was marked as withdrawn.

28:42.807 --> 28:43.668
It just wasn't there.

28:45.971 --> 28:49.255
In this case, there were six other copies available.

28:49.716 --> 28:51.738
Two of them were referenced.

28:51.758 --> 28:53.180
In this system, in the San Francisco system?

28:53.200 --> 28:54.702
In the San Francisco system.

28:55.663 --> 28:58.547
There are 26 branches in San Francisco and the main.

28:59.489 --> 29:04.939
And this signifies that the copy at Excelsior was lost.

29:06.202 --> 29:18.645
So the reason I put this kind of stuff down was to remind myself that I was keeping a record of all the offbeat

29:20.954 --> 29:25.319
Well, I was just keeping track of— Of the history of the book, I guess.

29:25.499 --> 29:29.883
Yeah, and it's not just that copy, but of the other copies in the system.

29:31.485 --> 29:42.497
So I would assume from this that, for example, there were six copies in the system.

29:44.899 --> 29:48.683
One had been lost, but I didn't count that as one of the copies.

29:49.102 --> 29:51.164
In other words, there are six copies available.

29:51.245 --> 30:05.622
This six AB means that they were, after they took out the discard and after other kinds of oddball things on the record, there were countable six copies.

30:06.002 --> 30:09.727
However, that was in the online catalog.

30:10.668 --> 30:18.197
I, in only one subcategory, the ones in the general collection on the third floor, I went

30:18.464 --> 30:26.694
to the shelves to see if the books that the online catalog said were there were actually on the shelves.

30:27.776 --> 30:30.019
And not in all cases were they.

30:31.140 --> 30:32.422
In most of the cases they were.

30:35.926 --> 30:38.710
So this is how my brain got addled.

30:40.252 --> 30:44.016
I put all this stuff on the computer.

30:44.057 --> 30:46.800
And then this little number down here says what box.

30:47.877 --> 30:53.805
It's in, or sometimes it'll say Grey Panther, and that means that it's here at this office.

30:53.925 --> 30:57.050
So it's in one of these boxes at my house.

30:57.090 --> 30:58.972
I didn't, that's not printed out here.

30:58.992 --> 31:01.796
So you call it, this 39 indicates, that's a location.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.639
A location in my house.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.361
That's a location code.

31:05.441 --> 31:06.343
Box 39, yeah.

31:07.224 --> 31:07.324
Okay.

31:09.106 --> 31:13.092
So when you went and you made your selection,

31:13.983 --> 31:17.287
What were the criteria?

31:17.307 --> 31:29.381
Yeah, that's what I had started to tell you, that the sessions where we were selecting books, I was in this frenzy in the amount of time that I had to take as many books as I could.

31:29.441 --> 31:34.446
And my criteria shifted around sometimes.

31:34.486 --> 31:43.737
Sometimes I was proving that this was indeed a research library, and I would take these abstruse old books on metallurgy or

31:44.543 --> 32:02.149
You know, just things that were obviously books that you would have if you wanted to provide the public with basic, pure science kind of information, and you can't claim it's light reading.

32:04.232 --> 32:13.926
But then my own particular interest and the Great Panther interests had sway.

32:14.125 --> 32:23.798
I picked a lot of books on social change, on campus unrest in the sixties.

32:23.878 --> 32:25.520
There's a lot of books on the sixties.

32:30.847 --> 32:43.103
History, psychology, sociology, humanities, but my brain is even swimming now.

32:43.437 --> 33:01.880
I also then at one point got some advice from a librarian, so I spent some time, the last time or two I was there, biasedly selecting books that were from university presses.

33:02.561 --> 33:09.850
I don't claim at any point that this selection of books is a representative sample

33:10.589 --> 33:14.413
of the fifty-eight thousand books that they gave away during that year.

33:14.473 --> 33:15.554
Fifty-eight thousand.

33:16.716 --> 33:19.519
I took, or we took, thirteen hundred and seventy.

33:19.919 --> 33:21.681
So you took a significant percentage.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.584
Took as many as I could get my hands off.

33:24.885 --> 33:26.126
So how often did you go over there?

33:27.107 --> 33:28.248
Four or five times.

33:29.450 --> 33:29.810
Total?

33:30.250 --> 33:31.252
Uh-huh.

33:31.272 --> 33:39.060
And that was, you know, like we had to— How much you went more than that, because thirteen hundred books— I picked them off the shelf really fast.

33:40.255 --> 33:42.958
I can't have been, maybe, did I say four or five?

33:43.039 --> 33:43.199
Yeah.

33:43.419 --> 33:48.065
It might have been five or six, but that's all there were.

33:49.627 --> 33:56.996
I went to every one, I think, each one of the appointments, times we set up.

33:57.016 --> 33:58.418
So you could take as many as you wanted.

33:58.438 --> 34:07.309
So you must have been taking, if you went five or six times, and my math isn't so good, but what, did you get 200 books every time you went?

34:07.981 --> 34:09.903
How did you get thirteen hundred and seventy books?

34:10.123 --> 34:17.130
Well, I had other people besides me picking books, although I did the majority, I have to admit.

34:18.572 --> 34:20.894
So you did the selection, but you had carriers.

34:20.914 --> 34:23.137
You had people who would remove them.

34:23.157 --> 34:25.659
Yeah, well, no, I had other people picking books, too.

34:26.380 --> 34:31.946
I mean, there's a lot of odd books here, a number of them that other people picked.

34:31.966 --> 34:36.250
I just left here.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.335
There's all kinds of books in the world.

34:42.018 --> 34:54.313
Basically I feel that I have a hatchback car and it'd be about maybe twenty cartons or fifteen, twenty cartons that I could fit in each trip.

34:55.354 --> 35:02.923
But I want to accentuate that I was in a frenzy.

35:03.063 --> 35:04.124
No one should talk.

35:04.204 --> 35:05.646
I got really weird.

35:05.997 --> 35:10.282
I got really weird about, don't interrupt me, I'm very busy.

35:11.043 --> 35:26.420
Because I was making the most of every minute there, and trying to pick worthwhile books, and also getting, part of the frenzy was getting into a kind of weird greed space, you know.

35:26.540 --> 35:35.650
I began to love, you know, if certain books would come my way, I'd just, my heart would leap with, um... Can you think of any of it?

35:36.558 --> 35:37.019
No.

35:39.442 --> 35:43.929
Something like that happened to me in Death Valley once.

35:43.989 --> 35:46.533
You're not supposed to even touch the pebbles there, right?

35:47.294 --> 35:51.601
And I was going around, and pretty soon I was just picking one pebble.

35:51.701 --> 35:52.903
I'm just going to take one pebble.

35:53.264 --> 35:58.071
But it's a kind of an irrational lust that comes upon me.

35:58.091 --> 35:59.393
I'm Greek, and my mother didn't.

35:59.660 --> 36:06.489
That precise thing at the Parthenon, at the Acropolis, she got dizzy, right?

36:07.070 --> 36:10.515
And she took a little piece of, a little fragment of marble.

36:11.096 --> 36:13.419
You know, this was from the Parthenon temple.

36:13.499 --> 36:15.021
I mean, she had to have it.

36:15.902 --> 36:19.928
And I think it was precisely the thing that you're describing here.

36:20.369 --> 36:20.589
It is.

36:20.689 --> 36:25.816
It's an amazing, it's not an intellectual response at all.

36:25.876 --> 36:27.198
It's emotional, isn't it?

36:27.218 --> 36:27.979
I would guess.

36:28.651 --> 36:32.296
I think it's driven by an intellectual... It barely touches the brain.

36:32.356 --> 36:38.764
It's caused by the brain because the brain is interested in that.

36:39.645 --> 36:56.667
The brain is working, but the response is a delight that... Now, maybe it's an intellectual delight, but it is distinctly more of a delight than an idea by that time.

36:56.708 --> 36:57.088
It's

36:59.144 --> 37:03.350
I don't know, let's see, I don't want to exaggerate it.

37:03.390 --> 37:07.176
Were you attracted by titles, by the physicality of the books?

37:07.796 --> 37:08.578
Oh, the content.

37:08.658 --> 37:17.791
So if it was a physically beautiful book with pictorial cloth, that wasn't necessarily what was expected.

37:19.273 --> 37:27.565
No, it was like, this is a valuable piece of… Scholarship?

37:27.916 --> 37:29.057
Well, I'll tell you one book.

37:29.177 --> 37:32.041
It was a book by, is it Thomas Merton?

37:34.563 --> 37:35.344
Robert Merton.

37:35.644 --> 37:38.468
I couldn't believe that I came as a sociologist.

37:38.488 --> 37:50.961
It was Robert Merton, Reader in Bureaucracy, and I believe they probably don't have another copy of that, and I marked on that card, that's a sin.

37:52.483 --> 37:57.248
But there were other books like

37:58.409 --> 38:05.378
Here's a book by Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Obsolete Communism, Left-Wing Alternative.

38:05.999 --> 38:09.603
How do you spell his name?

38:10.224 --> 38:12.928
Cohn-Bendit, C-O-H-N-B-E-N-D-I-T.

38:12.948 --> 38:13.448
Okay, C-O-H-N-D-I-T.

38:13.588 --> 38:16.132
So now, that would have been one of these experiences.

38:16.212 --> 38:23.421
What it is is that I couldn't have sat down and thought of that book, but I knew his name from my studies.

38:24.093 --> 38:28.657
And so I knew, oh, I've come out, you know, great, I got a little piece of that.

38:29.198 --> 38:43.051
It was that kind of a feeling, that I was coming upon little fragments of our culture that I was saving, and that I was outraged at them for giving away.

38:43.251 --> 38:53.121
And so the idea of giving them back to, you know, hanging on to them and then shaming them by saying, I'll give them back to you as soon as you have a policy.

38:53.371 --> 38:54.512
How did you tell them?

38:54.532 --> 39:03.182
How did you let them know that you had 1,370 of the public library books and you were holding them for them?

39:03.362 --> 39:23.344
I've gotten two, I think, articles in newspapers where I'm quoted saying that, and at the commission meeting I gave them a copy of the list, of an abbreviated list, asking for a list of all of those that are

39:23.864 --> 39:28.850
coded in the online computer as Ask Librarian for Holdings.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.516
And is that indicated here in this list that you're giving me?

39:33.896 --> 39:34.978
You're giving me this, right?

39:35.058 --> 39:38.201
Yes, I'm giving you that, but it's on there.

39:38.302 --> 39:39.343
How do I know?

39:39.383 --> 39:40.344
What's the code for that?

39:40.384 --> 39:50.056
The code is, let me put it here.

39:50.076 --> 39:51.017
Shalom Alephim.

39:51.377 --> 39:53.500
I can't believe they're giving away Shalom Alephim.

39:53.986 --> 40:08.645
Well, usually it's—oh, come on, Dacia, you made a particular effort to put that code in there.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.170
Oh, here.

40:15.975 --> 40:21.242
A is Ask Librarians for Holdings, and I'm giving you a list of only—

40:22.910 --> 40:27.618
that's sorted by... Well, you've given me a... Oh, good, yeah.

40:27.738 --> 40:28.700
I've got a code here.

40:28.800 --> 40:40.179
And then... But here is a... You know, all of these are A's, and these are all books that you... What you do... The computer tells you, ask a librarian for holdings.

40:40.861 --> 40:42.023
They're very deceptive here.

40:42.103 --> 40:45.829
They're telling you that they ask us about it, but when in fact they dump it.

40:47.142 --> 40:51.269
No, they dumped one, and they don't know where the others are.

40:51.289 --> 40:52.150
Other is.

40:52.211 --> 40:57.860
There's only one other, and when you find it on the computer, it says, ask librarian for holdings.

40:57.880 --> 41:06.194
So then you go to the librarian, you ask them for the holdings, and each librarian gives you a different reason for the fact that they don't know where it is.

41:06.775 --> 41:12.745
None of them seem to understand what ask librarian for holdings means, and it's something that was assigned by

41:13.720 --> 41:19.305
technical services or I don't know what, but they don't know where these books are, if they exist at all.

41:19.906 --> 41:21.467
You don't get them.

41:21.487 --> 41:22.808
You don't get any of these books.

41:25.971 --> 41:31.156
You indicated also that you did some research with the OCLC database?

41:31.696 --> 41:32.878
This is it.

41:35.140 --> 41:38.843
And this is, of course, OCLC, which is all over America.

41:39.323 --> 41:41.225
Oh, no, I didn't say that.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.187
I don't know what that means.

41:43.285 --> 41:47.210
When I asked you if you would determine whether or not any of these books were last copies.

41:48.031 --> 41:50.194
Oh, I'm not saying they're last copies in the world.

41:50.294 --> 41:53.118
I'm saying they're last copies in this library.

41:53.899 --> 41:56.242
Okay, we misunderstood each other.

41:56.262 --> 41:56.902
Oh, yeah.

41:57.283 --> 41:59.706
No, I haven't taken that next step.

42:00.427 --> 42:01.308
That would be really good.

42:01.328 --> 42:02.810
Well, if somebody wanted to do it.

42:02.830 --> 42:11.020
This is the list of, there were 98 books that the library had no other copies of in this system.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.963
Now, these books are on that list.

42:12.983 --> 42:13.123
Mm-hmm.

42:13.542 --> 42:14.303
with a zero.

42:14.823 --> 42:15.284
Here's one.

42:16.785 --> 42:31.681
So each of these books, for one reason or another, isn't—like this one, there's another edition of it, but they don't have any more of this edition.

42:33.123 --> 42:35.385
In this case, just nothing turns up.

42:36.406 --> 42:43.093
You look and it says, you know, I looked under the title, I looked under the title,

42:43.445 --> 42:45.888
the author and the call number.

42:45.908 --> 42:48.671
And in each of those cases, there was no record that showed up.

42:48.731 --> 42:50.593
It just reports to you.

42:51.535 --> 42:54.598
Your search did not find this sign.

42:54.618 --> 42:58.002
You don't have any really old old books, I noticed.

42:58.022 --> 43:02.768
The oldest book is— It was in 1909, which goes back.

43:04.550 --> 43:06.833
Did you go after any 19th-century books?

43:06.953 --> 43:08.334
I think there were a couple.

43:08.374 --> 43:13.080
There weren't that many that I saw.

43:13.904 --> 43:17.188
I, um, my memory's failing me now.

43:17.208 --> 43:20.172
I think there were a couple of, oh, I can answer that.

43:20.192 --> 43:32.046
I have a, I put a file where everything is.

43:32.066 --> 43:33.548
What is this poster here?

43:33.568 --> 43:35.070
That was outside my house.

43:35.170 --> 43:38.594
That is what kicked me into never quitting.

43:38.874 --> 43:40.536
It was so, it's so outrageous.

43:40.556 --> 43:42.679
Who were they quoting there?

43:44.279 --> 43:44.659
E.M.

43:44.699 --> 43:45.220
Forster.

43:45.721 --> 43:46.682
Oh, that's Forster's Claw?

43:46.702 --> 43:49.184
Yeah, it's in teeny letters down there.

43:51.147 --> 43:54.310
And what they thought they were doing, I do not know.

43:54.330 --> 44:01.718
That was at about the time—actually, it was after the new library had opened, I think.

44:02.559 --> 44:06.464
And it was right outside my house on the bus stop there, and I was enraged.

44:12.851 --> 44:13.932
Who posted this?

44:14.857 --> 44:21.045
This has nothing to do with... It had to do with the opening of the new... It was an ad for the new main library.

44:21.085 --> 44:21.566
Come see it.

44:21.666 --> 44:24.610
And it was Bank of America and Pacific Bell.

44:25.691 --> 44:27.634
There's the connection with Steve Colter.

44:27.654 --> 44:34.583
I mean, like, it was... They put a lot of money in PR into getting everybody to come to the new main library.

44:34.603 --> 44:37.807
That was part of Colter's whole thing.

44:37.827 --> 44:44.256
He's, you know, very excited about promoting this new extravaganza of a building.

44:59.390 --> 45:01.494
Very interesting.

45:01.514 --> 45:02.515
So what do you think?

45:03.056 --> 45:10.028
Have you ever heard anything from them about your books, or are they basically ignoring you, do you think?

45:11.490 --> 45:14.395
Well, no, they're ignoring me.

45:14.415 --> 45:17.120
Here's the... Oh, okay, sure.

45:17.140 --> 45:19.263
...by date.

45:20.505 --> 45:21.647
Well, that's a pretty old book.

45:23.971 --> 45:24.071
Yeah.

45:24.091 --> 45:25.093
It's a very old book.

45:27.419 --> 45:31.244
conchological manual, whatever the heck that is.

45:31.645 --> 45:37.092
Oh, it's a marvelously illustrated, beautiful drawings of shells.

45:38.214 --> 45:39.275
Conchological.

45:40.457 --> 45:41.479
It's all these shells.

45:42.600 --> 45:48.889
Back then, people, the marine, I mean, the shipping... Is it oversized?

45:49.049 --> 45:50.511
No, it's rather small.

45:50.591 --> 45:51.352
It's about like this.

45:52.955 --> 45:53.916
Is it in nice condition?

45:54.757 --> 45:56.920
Yes, except someone had razored

45:57.305 --> 46:07.934
a few plates out of it, but basically the rest, it's all in good shape and it's sturdy.

46:07.954 --> 46:19.504
Back in the, there were a number of books, this is something I learned from this, a number of books there that were reports from travelers or people, you know, like they were sailing around the world.

46:20.465 --> 46:26.670
So there were the kinds of reports they were getting that were like they collected everything, you know,

46:27.376 --> 46:31.041
They were listing and ordering everything that they were finding.

46:31.061 --> 46:32.343
Yeah, they were discovering things.

46:33.665 --> 46:34.967
That sounds like a lovely book.

46:36.629 --> 46:36.870
It is.

46:36.910 --> 46:38.052
It is.

46:38.092 --> 46:42.598
So yeah, they're kind of ignoring me.

46:42.939 --> 46:49.568
And then I've announced repeatedly at the commission meetings, they know me, they know that my concern is the books.

46:49.628 --> 46:55.577
And they sort of groan, if not audibly, visually.

46:55.979 --> 46:57.601
when I come up with it.

47:01.106 --> 47:20.974
They tried to make me look stupid, or others that expressed this, by saying that we apparently didn't understand that all libraries read books.

47:22.405 --> 47:47.298
And we just needed to be educated, and then there was this insulting go-around about how they were going to—Colder's idea, that he was going to set up a citizens' advisory committee, and it would be stocked with respectable members of the public that he would pick, and it definitely would not be one of odds.

47:50.743 --> 47:50.843
Sure.

47:51.228 --> 47:53.832
idea has kind of stopped being talked about.

47:54.613 --> 48:07.871
And this committee was going to decide about the books, as opposed to professionals who… They were going to be let in on the process, and I thought it was a dreadful idea, because I thought, oh, that is an opening to some real book burning, you know, to censorship.

48:07.891 --> 48:10.534
Oh, sure, because that's going to say, this is a horrible book, look at this.

48:11.135 --> 48:16.763
Oh, my goodness, this talks about abortion, you know.

48:17.013 --> 48:39.693
My suspicion of Coulter is such that he would—he was not above suspicion in my book of making stuff like that happen, because he has some specialized collections now there in the library, the status of which I'm not clear on.

48:39.933 --> 48:40.834
The gay and lesbian.

48:40.854 --> 48:42.515
The gay and lesbian.

48:42.756 --> 48:43.997
Which is his baby.

48:44.017 --> 48:44.337
Right.

48:44.357 --> 48:46.699
He's very clear to me that he wants this to be.

48:47.405 --> 48:55.437
He wants this to be the gay counterpart to the Schaumburg Collection in New York, which is the great African-American collection.

48:56.218 --> 49:03.910
And I said to him, I said, you understand, of course, that the Schaumburg Collection was put together by one individual, Arthur Alfonso Shaw.

49:04.010 --> 49:14.526
I mean, he didn't even know the Schaumburg's first name, you know, who was a great, great collector and who made and gave this and sold part of it to the New York Public Library.

49:15.012 --> 49:18.735
It's the preeminent collection in the world, and it was around that that they built this.

49:19.296 --> 49:25.261
You know, but just to say we're going to open a room, and this is now, I said, what have you done to acquire materials?

49:25.361 --> 49:26.862
I mean, you've got this lovely room there.

49:26.882 --> 49:28.003
What do you have for collections?

49:28.964 --> 49:30.245
You know, what do you have for materials?

49:30.686 --> 49:31.326
Great idea.

49:31.346 --> 49:32.487
I said, it is a good idea.

49:32.908 --> 49:33.788
Okay, why not?

49:33.808 --> 49:34.529
This is the city.

49:34.589 --> 49:36.491
If any city's going to do it, do it here.

49:36.931 --> 49:38.613
There should be an archive on this stuff.

49:39.413 --> 49:40.695
So what do you got in the archive?

49:40.715 --> 49:43.077
I mean, the Yellen-Ginsburg stuff went to Stanford.

49:43.177 --> 49:44.698
This would have been a good, you know,

49:44.999 --> 49:45.880
You know what I'm saying?

49:45.900 --> 49:46.661
Where's the beef?

49:47.102 --> 49:49.945
What have you got to show me for this collection?

49:50.446 --> 49:53.931
I'm going to ask those questions when I go over there Wednesday.

49:54.011 --> 49:56.814
I have some knowledge on research collections.

49:57.555 --> 50:05.586
Well, over in one of the branches there are a lot of cartons on top of the stacks of books that are gay and lesbian.

50:05.606 --> 50:12.795
And in the basement of Brooks Hall there are apparently a lot of uncatalogued gay and lesbian materials.

50:14.075 --> 50:15.817
that are waiting to be catalogued.

50:15.938 --> 50:19.062
But what is in the gay and lesbian room, I don't know.

50:19.082 --> 50:29.757
And I've asked that question, are these books that were taken out of the general collection put in the gay and lesbian room, or are they books that have been donated to the library from outside persons?

50:29.777 --> 50:34.404
Well, even more than books, what have you got for research materials?

50:34.424 --> 50:42.175
What have you got for any prominent gay writers who have given, who have

50:43.167 --> 50:51.075
whose papers, like Ginsburg, for instance, that would have been a terrific, you know, now you've got a research collection.

50:51.936 --> 50:59.904
But I mean, just to get some titles that have been written by gay authors, I mean, that's really not a great, such a strong statement.

51:00.545 --> 51:07.892
I don't think that's going to attract scholars here from around the world to do research in your collection, you know.

51:09.475 --> 51:14.121
I said, now Cornell has a remarkable collection.

51:14.141 --> 51:15.022
He had never heard of it.

51:15.102 --> 51:18.747
I said, it's probably the great gay lesbian collection.

51:18.767 --> 51:19.949
He says, Cornell?

51:20.109 --> 51:22.312
I didn't know anything about it.

51:22.332 --> 51:29.661
And it was given to Cornell by an alumnus who was gay, died of AIDS, exceedingly wealthy.

51:30.569 --> 51:33.112
And he gave a lot of money to Cornell.

51:33.132 --> 51:38.318
And of course they took the collection and ran the money, you know, and then they're building it.

51:38.338 --> 51:42.423
It's a major, major, major collection.

51:42.443 --> 51:44.946
But I don't think that they've got anything going like this over here.

51:44.966 --> 51:47.649
And I said, well, have you raised this money?

51:47.689 --> 51:48.550
Do you have a curator?

51:48.950 --> 51:52.755
Do you have somebody who's involved in collection development?

51:52.795 --> 51:55.598
Do you have, you know, I mean this is how libraries

51:56.692 --> 51:58.794
put together a facility for research.

51:58.874 --> 52:05.900
You don't just build a little place with a pretty dome and get the money and say it's a gay-lesbian affinity room.

52:07.001 --> 52:07.322
You know?

52:07.362 --> 52:10.504
Am I being foolish here?

52:10.625 --> 52:10.985
I don't know.

52:14.088 --> 52:16.150
Well, I don't know that much about libraries.

52:16.170 --> 52:18.512
You didn't have any answers for those questions.

52:19.653 --> 52:25.618
All I know is that the African-American room, whatever you're supposed to call it,

52:26.459 --> 52:30.644
doesn't have a librarian, doesn't have anybody.

52:31.425 --> 52:40.136
The effect is that all the books that are in that room are on reserve, I mean, are marked reference, so no one can take any of them out.

52:40.216 --> 52:41.298
They just have to stay there.

52:42.379 --> 52:51.711
And the day I was in there, there was a volunteer sitting in there, it turned out, and it was, he commented to me about ten minutes before leaving town.

52:51.731 --> 52:53.153
He says, well, I'll walk down with you.

52:53.193 --> 52:54.795
I don't think anyone can

52:55.822 --> 52:58.125
What was his word?

52:58.185 --> 53:01.330
Do any vandalism in ten minutes.

53:02.251 --> 53:07.419
So apparently he was sitting there to avert vandalism, but there's no librarian.

53:07.619 --> 53:09.081
Not there to answer any questions.

53:09.181 --> 53:11.745
Right.

53:11.765 --> 53:16.792
And I think one was promised, at least if not in that room, then in the gay and lesbian section.

53:17.052 --> 53:20.918
That just didn't happen.

53:22.248 --> 53:27.573
The numbers that you were able to put together was basically limited by the opportunities you had to go.

53:27.653 --> 53:30.255
There would be more if there had been more days, right?

53:30.916 --> 53:42.286
Yes, and I'm glad now that there was that limitation put on it, otherwise I would be even more addled than I am.

53:42.306 --> 53:51.715
I wanted for the longest time, and I still would like it.

53:51.880 --> 54:02.415
to be able to land at some public display place where these books could be shown to the public and there would be a computer they could act.

54:02.515 --> 54:21.583
I was even thinking in terms of, well, of making a kind of little museum so that with pictures like this and documents from what's been going on, you make a big scrapbook of the beef that's been going on here.

54:22.390 --> 54:29.818
just documenting the struggle, the ongoing struggle, over protecting the books.

54:30.298 --> 54:39.868
And basically the statement of that is, as far as I'm concerned, is that they stole our old main library from us, selling us the new main library.

54:39.908 --> 54:48.077
In the course of that, letting the foundation, the private foundation in, the nose under the tent,

54:48.935 --> 55:04.049
to do the furnishings for the library because the bond issue can't be used for the furnishings, so they threw away all the old furnishings from the old main library, and the foundation supposedly paid for all of the new furnishings plus the computers.

55:05.170 --> 55:15.901
So that in one fell swoop we switched to a heavy-duty computerization, 200 or 300 computers now, where there were about, I don't know, six or something.

55:16.962 --> 55:18.503
A conversion to computers

55:18.770 --> 55:24.396
with the commitments that are involved there of enormous amounts of money and endless bottom pit of it, too.

55:25.637 --> 55:40.353
Another million has now been proposed by the new acting librarian for a whole new set of, I guess it's hardware, point-and-click technology, graphic technology with a mouse.

55:41.153 --> 55:48.321
And she thinks that everybody's going to be happier if they have that, and pointing out to her that that does nothing to

55:48.892 --> 55:53.657
solve the shortcomings of the online catalog that are there.

55:55.839 --> 56:05.228
There are books that the public simply has not got access to because they can't know about them, because they're not in the online catalog.

56:06.289 --> 56:15.878
So doing some cosmetic changes to the computer terminals they use is not doing anything at all

56:16.077 --> 56:17.219
for the basic problem.

56:17.279 --> 56:34.323
It's just joshing the public along and making them think that they've got something better, but in fact it's just another kind of search system with the same inadequacies of cataloging that you're searching for.

56:34.364 --> 56:36.487
So it's a waste of money.

56:40.773 --> 56:42.996
She seems to have her mind fixed on that.

56:43.634 --> 57:01.646
My notion is that the fix is in, that that technology somehow is seen as some kind of necessary step for the further development of the telecommunications technology they want to or have to go along with.

57:01.726 --> 57:07.296
I don't know enough about internet and about

57:08.086 --> 57:11.229
Well, you sure know enough about computers, though.

57:11.249 --> 57:11.970
Look at what you've done here.

57:12.110 --> 57:16.335
Well, I can work my own little computer, yeah, and you don't need anything high-powered for that.

57:16.755 --> 57:32.031
I have a dumb little old PC, IBM clone thing, and I have an Alpha 4 program, and so I just know how to do that.

57:33.433 --> 57:37.637
I think that it's a kind of insanity for the library to

57:38.107 --> 57:47.757
take on the job of educating the public to use the web and internet.

57:47.777 --> 57:55.205
You know, like that's a job for the community college or maybe for the older classes in the schools.

57:57.107 --> 58:06.797
But I hardly dare make that argument because people are so enthralled by

58:07.368 --> 58:09.051
the potential of the computer.

58:12.436 --> 58:19.328
It's like a huge wave, and you're trying to go that way, and the wave is going this way.

58:19.548 --> 58:20.690
People don't want to hear it.

58:21.832 --> 58:32.970
And on top of it, there is an industry, Gates being the very unpopular head of it,

58:35.110 --> 58:42.659
Not in an organizational—well, there is a—the economy is sucked into that right now.

58:44.040 --> 58:49.827
All the development has to do with electronics and the investment and the capital.

58:49.867 --> 59:00.679
I mean, it's over my head to understand it, but the impetus of the economy is in that.

59:02.971 --> 59:14.810
I think the libraries are making a serious mistake in getting into it, because if they have to keep up with the Joneses on that technology, their budget problems are only beginning.

59:16.352 --> 59:28.692
Because as I understand it, you have to keep upgrading the technology in order to

59:29.161 --> 59:31.826
interlink with the other technologies.

59:31.846 --> 59:34.171
So you don't, after a point, you don't have any choice.

59:34.331 --> 59:35.253
Oh, that's right.

59:35.273 --> 59:43.790
Once you're embarked on that path, you know, it's awfully hard to turn away from it.

59:43.810 --> 59:48.921
Because the one valid reason that the library has— I mean, they're on that path.

59:48.981 --> 59:51.085
I don't see how they're ever going to get, you know—

59:51.402 --> 01:00:05.241
I got some suggestions to make how they could simply limit themselves to using the computers for the online catalog and bring back the old card catalog to use in conjunction with the online catalog until the online catalog is complete, number one.

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:14.914
Then if they want to access other libraries' catalogs, limit the use to that.

01:00:16.737 --> 01:00:18.439
But leave the...

01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:37.187
The free-floating internet function, the web function, you know, like accessing other museums or all that other stuff that it does, leave that out of the mission statement of the library.

01:00:38.229 --> 01:00:44.138
Have the computerization in the library relate to accessing books, period.

01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:46.401
Well, I don't know if you're going to get that either.

01:00:46.938 --> 01:00:52.624
But if we don't, well, probably not, but it's, I think, a reasonable statement to make.

01:00:52.784 --> 01:01:14.886
And if not, one advantage to that is it would solve this waterfall place we're coming to, what do you call it, a real problem place, a rapid of the First Amendment, the freedom of information or free speech issue.

01:01:16.334 --> 01:01:21.260
I can see the library just breaking up on the shoals over that.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.525
I mean, they have hard enough time handling it when it's just books.

01:01:25.746 --> 01:01:43.649
But with the kinds of problems they're going to be having, they're already having children coming in the library and finding a pornographic screen on and the parents getting upset and then making rules about that, which are going to make possible restrictions on political thought and blah-de-blah-de-blah.

01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:45.852
So if you were to...

01:01:46.658 --> 01:01:53.464
just say the use of computers in the library is in relation to books, and keep it to that.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:55.966
Then you keep away from that issue.

01:01:57.307 --> 01:01:59.008
So these books are all over your house?

01:01:59.169 --> 01:02:03.012
Do you have a house or an apartment, or is it a tight space over there?

01:02:03.232 --> 01:02:16.243
Well, I have a lot of rooms, but my house has become a chaotic jumble of all my old life, half-filed, because three years ago I had a fire that

01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:42.585
went through my tapes and archives and some of it's rescued and some of it's not and that was not sorted out at the time this came upon me so there are three rooms with various stacks of things in it and then the hallway has cartons in the hallway and the stairs have cartons on the stairs but the bulk of the books are in
