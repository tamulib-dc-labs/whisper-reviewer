WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:05.293
You bother and threaten me.

00:06.795 --> 00:08.076
Boy, you know, that's quite a comment.

00:08.096 --> 00:08.456
That is.

00:08.476 --> 00:13.002
I mean, that is a pearl for Freudians to pick up.

00:13.022 --> 00:22.392
And I'm not sure that anybody would have written that into a letter in post-Freudian time.

00:22.412 --> 00:24.254
Oh, I'd be amazed.

00:24.755 --> 00:25.916
You know what I mean?

00:25.936 --> 00:30.561
Because Freudianism brought a kind of self-consciousness into our diction of sex.

00:31.216 --> 00:39.413
And no man can ever write a sentence like that again without, I mean, no cultivated man, without saying, oh my God, what am I saying?

00:39.774 --> 00:42.660
It's like reading some of the things that Walt Whitman wrote, you know?

00:42.680 --> 00:43.301
Yeah.

00:45.105 --> 00:46.147
It's the same kind of thing.

00:47.590 --> 00:49.815
I didn't realize how many...

00:49.795 --> 00:55.301
People of note, the literati, burned their letters during that time.

00:55.361 --> 00:58.605
I guess there was this great fear of being scandalized.

00:59.005 --> 01:10.198
I think it began much more in the 1870s, and it was triggered by a couple of concrete social factors.

01:10.278 --> 01:16.225
One, the Victorian puritanism of Great Britain sort of seeped into France.

01:16.390 --> 01:20.075
It was a very sort of anglo-philic time.

01:20.095 --> 01:26.183
People left everything British in the 1860s and 1870s.

01:26.704 --> 01:28.467
They had not in the earlier part of the century.

01:29.168 --> 01:37.539
And so it was sort of taking on the British then Victorian Puritanism and saying, this cannot be left.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.762
I mean, this is bad for my image.

01:39.862 --> 01:44.068
Let's forge our image as it should be.

01:44.437 --> 01:51.747
And I think that's a very concrete historical cause for the burning of letters in France at that particular time.

01:52.568 --> 01:54.491
Now, what are you working on now, might I ask?

01:58.637 --> 02:06.848
I am starting a biography, sort of a compound biography, of the Marquise de Sade.

02:07.169 --> 02:07.509
Really?

02:08.230 --> 02:14.359
And her mother as a study, I mean, as a study in the

02:14.845 --> 02:19.293
the power of French women in the Ancien Régime.

02:19.914 --> 02:22.859
I love that book that Forrest Rose published a couple months ago.

02:23.581 --> 02:24.622
Oh, on the biography.

02:24.642 --> 02:25.704
Exactly, yeah, really.

02:25.784 --> 02:27.107
I reviewed it in the New Yorker.

02:27.267 --> 02:27.568
He did?

02:28.309 --> 02:30.112
Yeah, September 6th issue.

02:30.132 --> 02:30.733
Did you like it?

02:31.294 --> 02:32.897
I loved it.

02:33.097 --> 02:38.507
I found a few flaws that he didn't explain side relations with his mother enough, which again is a kind of

02:38.993 --> 02:41.295
It's quite a good book, I thought.

02:41.375 --> 02:44.538
I thought it was a wonderful book.

02:44.619 --> 02:48.422
I thought it was very, very well done.

02:48.462 --> 02:50.564
And this is really balanced biography of science.

02:50.825 --> 02:52.086
Well, I'll certainly look forward to it.

02:52.226 --> 02:53.928
Are you just beginning work on this now?

02:54.148 --> 02:56.951
Yes, I've written up my proposals.

02:57.712 --> 03:04.258
I mean, the 25-page proposals, I've already done quite a bit of background.

03:04.576 --> 03:11.871
She left a lot of letters to him, and that's another story about women's power and powerlessness.

03:11.891 --> 03:14.035
Which is a recurring theme in your concern.

03:14.115 --> 03:19.767
I think that the whole dialectic of power and powerlessness is a recurring theme in my work, yeah.

03:20.877 --> 03:25.449
I think I have plenty of material here, and I won't take up any more of your time.

03:26.251 --> 03:29.078
And I thank you very much for taking the time to talk to me.

03:29.098 --> 03:32.146
Be very kind, and I will look forward to... And I'll have something pretty quickly.

03:32.828 --> 03:33.028
All right.

03:33.048 --> 03:33.710
Thank you very much.

03:34.151 --> 03:34.352
Thank you.

03:34.372 --> 03:34.853
Bye-bye.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.102
And I'm on now.

03:42.403 --> 03:43.324
I'm talking to Peter Benchley.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.872
This is the 20th anniversary of JAWS, is that correct?

03:48.332 --> 03:49.174
Yes.

03:49.294 --> 03:53.902
JAWS came out in the spring of 1974.

03:53.922 --> 03:54.062
Uh-huh.

03:54.222 --> 04:05.160
Is this just coincidental that we're doing a book with the title White Shark, or is it an observance for you of some sort of anniversary?

04:05.140 --> 04:17.520
No, it's partly coincidental, but I knew that I wanted to call it that because you haven't had an opportunity to read the book, which I appreciate, but I'm not dealing with animals in this.

04:17.941 --> 04:22.288
Instead, it is a different kind of villain.

04:22.893 --> 04:34.326
I thought that because of the nature of the villain, it would have had a code name under the circumstances, and I thought what better code name than White Shark, so I didn't have the arrogance to presume a certain resonance for the name.

04:34.987 --> 04:35.408
I did.

04:36.109 --> 04:52.748
I started it, and I really resisted the temptation to go rushing ahead to see what happens, but clearly we have a Nazi here on a submarine, and we're just being attacked by a plane, so I'm just kind of getting into it.

04:52.728 --> 04:56.172
So tell me, is this a Peter Benchley thriller?

04:56.953 --> 05:15.994
Oh, yes, but the difference is that I had known of a number of things that I wanted to say and plot the story that I wanted to tell, and the story needed a villain as a motor, and I could not find, nor did I find it appropriate to speak, an animal who was a villain.

05:16.074 --> 05:19.157
I can't use animals as villains for several reasons.

05:20.335 --> 05:32.631
and the research has changed on sharks in the past 20 years so that what I did as a modest ambition in 1974 would be inapplicable today because we know a great deal more about white sharks than they did back then.

05:33.392 --> 05:46.610
Anyway, I've used killer whales, I'm sorry, not killer whales, giant squid, and I don't believe that one can, in a bona fide way, turn an animal into a villain, especially not an ecological villain.

05:46.710 --> 05:48.132
The villain of the piece

05:49.124 --> 05:53.170
It has to be a man because man is the spoiler of the seas.

05:53.230 --> 06:02.545
And there was a wonderful statistic I ran into the other day that for every shark attack on a human being, four and a half million sharks are killed by human beings.

06:02.605 --> 06:05.269
Do you feel some personal responsibility for that?

06:06.491 --> 06:09.736
Do you feel some personal responsibility for that in some way?

06:10.156 --> 06:11.158
No, no, no, no.

06:11.238 --> 06:15.064
The people who are killing sharks have nothing to do with...

06:15.415 --> 06:17.119
or any sort of reaction to it.

06:17.460 --> 06:23.676
What's killing the sharks is reckless, irresponsible, and ignorant greed, basically.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.366
It is two new kinds of fishing, the longlines and the gillnets.

06:27.700 --> 06:40.216
And then a third kind, which is the Asians who want to have shark fins, and they are going all over the world catching sharks and de-finning them and throwing the still-living carcasses back into the ocean.

06:40.517 --> 06:51.551
So the incidence of macho lunacy in people who are attacking sharks in a Jaws frenzy is utterly insignificant and has certainly passed in the past few years.

06:51.591 --> 06:52.633
It doesn't exist anymore.

06:53.894 --> 06:56.678
White sharks, in particular, are protected.

06:57.940 --> 07:12.270
Anyway, to get back to the original question, I got into some research a scientist had done at Duke in the 1960s about creating an amphibious human being, and he did it

07:13.381 --> 07:17.046
succeeded up to a point, and he thought this was going to be the future of diving.

07:17.767 --> 07:27.079
And other people agreed with him, my God, if you could make an amphibious human being think of what a wonderful thing it would be for people to be able to go to a thousand feet without worrying about the bend or anything else.

07:27.099 --> 07:27.459
Jeez.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.861
So this is what we've got here.

07:28.901 --> 07:29.342
Is this it?

07:30.383 --> 07:32.886
You don't have to worry about... In fact, they did that.

07:33.447 --> 07:35.570
And I thought, what an interesting idea.

07:35.630 --> 07:41.818
Suppose it had been done earlier in Germany, sort of the way they were doing lunatic experiments, Mengele and others,

07:42.355 --> 08:08.498
for no good purpose but pure science in their eyes and suppose they had effectively created out of a psychopath they had created an amphibious human being and they were trying to take it to South America to continue work on it and the submarine got sunk and then cut to 50 years later the thing is finally recovered by accident by the National Geographic and is on its way home or on its way back

08:11.633 --> 08:14.217
Therefore, it becomes the predatory.

08:15.399 --> 08:15.760
Wow.

08:16.862 --> 08:18.825
Now, there's no tongue-in-cheek in this for you, is there?

08:19.807 --> 08:23.233
I mean, this is not... No, there certainly isn't in the telling of the story.

08:23.774 --> 08:27.921
There's tongue-in-cheek to a certain extent in the title, of course, and there are...

08:32.727 --> 08:34.611
But this is a serious thriller.

08:35.352 --> 08:45.291
I did read someplace where when you were doing the last one on the squid, you were torn between making a kind of a comic thriller and they told you, look, you can't do this.

08:46.514 --> 08:50.702
Is that an accurate reflection of what happened with the book on the...

08:50.682 --> 09:18.462
on the squid yes i i did beef i thought i would do it as a comedy first and uh i did 200 pages of a of a comic squid novel and um turned it into my editor of random house and said i think this is brilliant she said well i don't know what it is uh it's you can't really get away with doing a a comic thriller because if you're asking people on the one hand to be afraid and on the other to laugh at it those are conflicting emotions so either do a comedy or do a thriller

09:18.914 --> 09:26.409
But if you have a giant squid, it's my feeling, said she, that a squid lends itself enormously to the thriller conflict.

09:30.757 --> 09:33.282
So what we have here is a mutant, in other words.

09:33.502 --> 09:34.043
Is this right?

09:34.524 --> 09:35.646
Some kind of a mutant.

09:35.666 --> 09:40.095
Remember the old commercials, it's not nice to whatever it is, fool Mother Nature?

09:40.784 --> 09:47.531
That's what this is about, essentially, is what's happening not in genetic research.

09:47.591 --> 09:50.253
I don't propose to know anything about that.

09:50.334 --> 10:06.510
But when we start screwing around with the oceans from any point of view, of dumping things in them, of overfishing them, of fooling with the food chain in any way at all, there are effects that are much more far-reaching than anybody can imagine.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.732
It's like the fellow who released

10:14.213 --> 10:24.780
So in this case, you have a man who was fooling around with a divine creation and deciding he's going to make something new out of it, and it's a poor idea.

10:25.672 --> 10:28.696
There's a book I just read by James Hall.

10:28.716 --> 10:29.938
I don't know if you're familiar with him.

10:31.139 --> 10:44.337
He writes down in Florida, and the whole premise there is they have this fish, the red tilapia, which I guess is somebody brought the thing over, and it's going wild.

10:44.417 --> 10:48.202
It's introducing the species, I guess, down in Florida.

10:48.282 --> 10:51.426
Of course, then he uses this as a premise in the book, you know.

10:51.406 --> 10:56.854
Yeah, well, apparently there's a muscle that's gotten loose up in the Great Lakes, right?

10:57.735 --> 11:03.043
And that came over attached to some ship's bottoms, and now that's loose and is damaging everything up there.

11:03.684 --> 11:13.237
So do you have a sense of an ecological message here in your novels, or is it fundamentally entertainment in your view?

11:13.618 --> 11:17.363
Well, to me, to do something preachy is a waste of time.

11:21.528 --> 11:26.074
If you can get any sort of message through an entertaining story, you're in better shape.

11:26.094 --> 11:31.621
It gives a certain amount of substance to the story, and I have no interest particularly in telling stories for the sake of telling stories.

11:32.542 --> 11:45.358
In Beasts, the squid novel, there was a sense of disrupting the entire food chain in the oceans by killing sperm whales, and it caused a vast increase in the number of giant squid.

11:45.378 --> 11:46.320
That was the premise of this.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.505
Again, you can't, with impunity, mess with nature

11:51.346 --> 11:53.952
expect everything to go along as it did.

11:53.972 --> 12:05.119
And there was a lot of stuff in that book about Bermuda and what happened with the destruction, in fact, with the destruction of the entire food chain around Bermuda and how every little event causes ripples

12:11.680 --> 12:14.884
When did you start thinking about this particular book?

12:14.904 --> 12:17.728
I mean, where did the idea for this one come from?

12:17.868 --> 12:24.157
I know there's always been something that's pushed you towards a... Well, I thought of it a couple of years ago.

12:24.177 --> 12:38.717
I started thinking about, first of all, since I live in Connecticut in the summertime in Nantucket, and I see the destruction of the blue fishing industry and the glumination of the bats and the swordfish and the tunafish,

12:39.187 --> 12:42.171
And I thought, again, this isn't something worth looking at.

12:42.431 --> 12:49.440
And I made a false start on it again of 200 or 300 pages because I fell in love with the research about the Germans.

12:49.460 --> 12:54.426
And I did an enormous amount of reading about what life was like on a U-boat during World War II.

12:54.806 --> 13:05.219
And my false start consisted of a very long episode, probably 150 pages about the crossing of the Atlantic on the U-boat.

13:05.299 --> 13:06.561
And I suddenly realized, by God, you're

13:08.195 --> 13:09.296
50 years ago, who cares?

13:10.598 --> 13:15.504
And as you'll see in this book, the German thing probably takes 15 or 20 pages, and that's all.

13:15.724 --> 13:29.320
Well, I just, like I said, the FedEx arrived with the thing about 1.30, you know, and they're already under attack by the airplane, so I figure that takes care of it for the U-boat.

13:29.921 --> 13:30.982
Right, and that's probably on page 25.

13:31.002 --> 13:33.645
Yeah, that's about it.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.509
And, you know, and I kind of went in really knowing.

13:36.890 --> 13:54.614
By the way, I'm doing this for a number of newspapers, and the reason for the rush on this is that I got a summer gig here with Hamptons Magazine on Long Island, and they're quite eager to start the season on Memorial Day with a feature on Peter Benchley.

13:54.695 --> 13:57.959
That's why I really asked to get this thing put together rather quickly.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.501
Well, no, it's good for me also.

13:59.521 --> 14:00.763
I've got to go to the Vineyard on...

14:01.081 --> 14:04.044
Monday morning for a week with the Discovery Channel, so it worked out well.

14:04.064 --> 14:04.344
Okay.

14:04.684 --> 14:17.036
Now, you've done since Jaws or prior to Jaws, or I don't know the history of this, but coincidental with your interest that either began with that book?

14:17.056 --> 14:23.142
I mean, you really have been quite involved in the ocean, haven't you?

14:23.182 --> 14:28.827
No, but I grew up off Nantucket during the summer, so I've always been involved with the ocean.

14:29.313 --> 14:38.446
After Jaws, thank heavens, ABC came to me and said that I want to go down to South Australia and get in the water with white sharks, which I did.

14:38.466 --> 14:49.242
And then I developed kind of an informal franchise for 10 or 15 years for ABC of being the person who was willing to go do American sportsman shows by diving with the anthropophagites, the things that want to eat you.

14:50.183 --> 14:52.907
So I've done probably over time 20...

14:53.360 --> 15:01.817
or so documentaries about the ocean and have done a bunch of books about it and spend as much time as I possibly can in, on, around, and under it.

15:02.084 --> 15:14.779
Chris, it's kind of interesting that the film Jaws was a Spielberg thing, a movie, and then the dinosaurs came along with Crichton's book.

15:16.502 --> 15:19.946
Are you hopeful that you could get something like that out of this?

15:20.026 --> 15:20.947
No, no.

15:21.928 --> 15:28.556
Spielberg has said, I think, kind of interestingly, he was asked about Jurassic Park, and he said it was my attempt to make a good sequel to Jaws.

15:28.897 --> 15:29.878
Is that right?

15:29.898 --> 15:29.998
Yeah.

15:31.312 --> 15:33.054
How come you didn't think of the dinosaurs?

15:33.074 --> 15:36.698
That was almost the next logical step, isn't it?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.700
Michael Crichton, that was a brilliant idea.

15:38.740 --> 15:39.621
It was a brilliant book.

15:40.161 --> 15:42.343
Because the premise is absolutely valid.

15:42.664 --> 15:43.204
It really is.

15:43.224 --> 15:45.507
I don't know whether it's valid, but it sure was convincing.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.929
And he writes with a great deal of scientific authority.

15:47.949 --> 15:49.951
And whether it's true or not, I believe it.

15:49.971 --> 15:52.534
Yeah, but I mean, there was a piece in the New York Times.

15:52.574 --> 15:57.359
They were doing this DNA research from Amber, you know.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.183
And that was pretty interesting.

16:01.163 --> 16:05.179
Let me see, you set this off the Connecticut coast, I guess, right?

16:05.761 --> 16:06.143
Yeah.

16:06.163 --> 16:09.958
You've kind of moved it a little bit.

16:10.613 --> 16:12.176
And, of course, it's not tied in.

16:12.256 --> 16:13.859
I'm trying to remember back to Jaws.

16:13.879 --> 16:16.704
Did that thing kick off at the beginning of the summer?

16:16.764 --> 16:20.611
Was that Memorial Day weekend when Jaws?

16:20.631 --> 16:21.893
I really don't remember when it was.

16:22.113 --> 16:23.756
It was about that time, sir.

16:23.776 --> 16:27.563
But, I mean, the story itself, I think they were worried about the summer starting, right?

16:27.683 --> 16:29.206
In the book, it was July 4th.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.290
It was 4th of July coming up.

16:31.310 --> 16:32.031
Okay, I'm just trying to.

16:35.723 --> 16:37.585
The beach is open for the 4th of July.

16:38.046 --> 16:43.392
Now, I remember reading something about you almost wrote Jaws on a dare.

16:43.552 --> 16:51.542
I mean, somebody gave you a $1,000 advance, and the book was either going to be about pirates or sharks.

16:51.562 --> 16:52.743
No, that's not true.

16:54.585 --> 17:05.578
When I worked for Newsweek, periodically we would go to lunch with editors, all of us writers at Newsweek, because it was a free lunch for us, and the editors thought that once in a while they might get a book out of a writer for a magazine.

17:06.757 --> 17:11.946
The two ideas that I had played with over the years were one doing something on pirates and one doing something on sharks.

17:12.748 --> 17:20.081
I had seen an article in the New York Daily News in 1964 about a guy who caught a 4,500-pound white shark off Long Island.

17:21.363 --> 17:27.895
And the editors were always perfectly encouraging and said, gee, either one sounds great, you know, why don't you do something?

17:27.935 --> 17:28.676
And then I never did it.

17:29.157 --> 17:29.878
Finally...

17:30.112 --> 17:34.718
Tom Congdon of Doubleday knew the way to an impecunious writer's heart was to offer money.

17:34.818 --> 17:37.101
So he said, I'll tell you what, I like the shark idea.

17:37.141 --> 17:39.204
I'll give you $1,000 for four chapters.

17:40.405 --> 17:42.728
And if you do the four chapters, we'll write a contract.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.413
So after a period of months, I hadn't done the four chapters.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.856
My agent said, you better give the man his $1,000 back.

17:48.876 --> 17:50.759
And I didn't have it.

17:51.059 --> 17:52.681
So that was the incentive I needed.

17:52.721 --> 17:54.263
And I sat down and wrote the first four chapters.

17:57.128 --> 17:57.969
That's amazing.

17:58.831 --> 18:02.417
Did the response to that, I mean, does it still boggle you?

18:02.437 --> 18:06.723
I mean, did you expect the kind of mega hit that emerged out of that?

18:07.785 --> 18:07.985
Oh, no.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.069
I knew for a fact that the book couldn't be successful.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.374
For one thing, it was a first novel and nobody reads first novels.

18:13.454 --> 18:15.698
And two, it was a first novel about a fish.

18:17.140 --> 18:21.988
And three, I knew they couldn't make a movie out of it because you couldn't catch and train a great white shark.

18:23.167 --> 18:26.733
Yeah, that's something, huh?

18:27.915 --> 18:45.647
And would you say you wrote this, you really didn't write this on a lark, of course, because you had $1,000 and you didn't have the $1,000 to give back, but were you, I mean, did you really think that this was going to be your, we're talking about in your early 30s, I guess, at that point.

18:45.627 --> 18:47.629
and still trying to figure out where you're going.

18:48.730 --> 18:54.635
I mean, was being a professional writer a fiction writer in your mindset here?

18:55.776 --> 19:03.163
Oh, I knew that in an ideal world that's what I would have liked to have done, yes, but at the time I had, as I said, no ambitions for the book at all.

19:03.203 --> 19:14.233
I just knew that I was freelancing for magazines and not making any money, and I had two young children and $600 in the bank, and I had composed a letter to the National Geographic begging for a

19:25.705 --> 19:31.694
I had no idea what it was going to become, nor did I have any idea that it would give me the freedom that it did.

19:31.714 --> 19:49.140
Do you think that if it hadn't been as successful as it was, that you would have had maybe more freedom, say, to write and any number of different, to pursue other avenues as a fiction writer, or have you pretty much gone the way you think you wanted to go since Jaws?

19:49.581 --> 19:53.687
Well, that's always hard to determine as to whether, what would have happened if

19:55.844 --> 20:06.160
The success of Jaws gave me the opportunity, because of the television involvement later on, to go do more and more and more about the oceans, which I loved and would have killed to have the opportunity to do.

20:06.180 --> 20:17.056
And so once I had that opportunity, stories led from my experiences, and every book that I've done has had some basis in my own life.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.822
Even the comedy that I did about the White House was based on

20:21.848 --> 20:24.030
my time in the White House 18 years before that.

20:24.050 --> 20:43.688
So although I have developed something of an ocean franchise, if you will, that's, what can I say, that that's not, it's not something I would have avoided if Jaws had not been successful, but because it was successful, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time learning more and more about it.

20:43.729 --> 20:49.594
If it hadn't been successful in what I had done, I probably would have still been trying to get a job at The Geographic, and that's where that would have led.

20:51.059 --> 20:54.343
How many novels now in 20 years?

20:54.403 --> 20:55.605
It must be, what, 10?

20:55.945 --> 20:56.906
I think this is the ninth.

20:57.087 --> 20:57.647
Is it ninth?

20:57.988 --> 20:58.388
The ninth?

20:58.568 --> 20:59.209
That's amazing.

20:59.249 --> 21:01.032
And what do you see next?

21:02.113 --> 21:02.934
Are you working?

21:03.615 --> 21:13.287
In between those novels, unlike somebody like Stephen King who turns them out one and two and three a year, I'm not that prolific and I spend a lot of time

21:13.705 --> 21:15.868
diving and doing whatever television shows I can.

21:15.988 --> 21:29.927
So in between the novels, I tend to do screenplays that more often than not don't get bought or made, and television shows, when I can get myself wired into them, that take me around the world learning more about the oceans.

21:29.947 --> 21:37.637
So at the moment, I'm doing a project for the Smithsonian and Times Mirror about the oceans that

21:48.097 --> 21:50.120
So who knows what will happen next?

21:50.261 --> 21:54.187
I never have any idea.

21:54.207 --> 21:54.508
Okay.

21:55.690 --> 21:58.134
Excuse me for being a little vague here.

21:58.154 --> 22:03.743
Again, we did just put this thing together in a very short amount of time.

22:04.415 --> 22:14.936
Your father certainly, he critiqued, or he certainly read Jaws, and he enjoyed it, I guess.

22:15.237 --> 22:21.529
I guess I'm trying to get something here on the Benchley tradition.

22:21.509 --> 22:25.695
Your grandfather was from Worcester, by the way, isn't that right?

22:26.036 --> 22:27.198
Yes.

22:27.218 --> 22:29.161
Did you know there's a Benchley Square in Worcester?

22:29.601 --> 22:30.202
I didn't know that.

22:30.222 --> 22:33.287
I knew there were still some Benchleys up in that neighborhood.

22:33.307 --> 22:39.536
I don't know how famous it is, but I think that there is actually a little marker there, Benchley Square.

22:39.556 --> 22:41.199
Somebody mentioned that to me the other day.

22:43.803 --> 22:45.625
My whole family comes from that whole area.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.967
I think my father was born in Newton.

22:48.029 --> 22:48.970
Right.

22:48.990 --> 22:50.773
And grandfather in Worcester.

22:51.800 --> 22:56.711
We spend all of our summers in Nantucket, so our connection goes back generations.

22:58.635 --> 23:02.924
I'm wondering, you're leaving for the vineyard, is that right?

23:03.185 --> 23:04.628
Yeah, Monday.

23:05.823 --> 23:09.688
Are you going to be around maybe during, could I reach you at some point?

23:10.308 --> 23:14.574
You know, I really feel kind of silly asking you questions about a book that I haven't read yet.

23:16.476 --> 23:21.582
Would it be at all possible to reach you in a couple, two, three days at some point, do you think?

23:21.602 --> 23:23.765
Or are you going to be kind of out of it?

23:23.825 --> 23:26.668
My problem is I don't know what I'm going to be doing up there.

23:26.688 --> 23:30.012
I know where I'll be, which is in a hotel called the Harborview.

23:30.032 --> 23:30.733
Uh-huh.

23:30.882 --> 23:32.684
which I know that's over in Edyartown.

23:34.407 --> 23:36.349
I'd be happy to answer whatever questions you have.

23:36.369 --> 23:42.638
Okay, I think what I want to do is, I mean, I think I'm pretty certain that I know what I want to write here.

23:42.658 --> 23:51.790
And I think that you have given me some good quotes, and I do have some other material, but you never know.

23:51.850 --> 23:53.953
You know, there might be another question or two.
