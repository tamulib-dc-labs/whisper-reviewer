WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:08.231
And we are now taping and we're talking, how do you pronounce your name?

00:08.872 --> 00:09.614
Is it Hahnemann?

00:10.475 --> 00:10.735
Hahnemann.

00:10.936 --> 00:11.957
Hahnemann, okay.

00:12.799 --> 00:13.400
Okay, good.

00:14.502 --> 00:17.827
Can I have a chance to make, to correct a couple misleading remarks?

00:17.947 --> 00:18.268
Sure.

00:18.749 --> 00:20.892
I made one we talked on May 16th.

00:20.912 --> 00:24.418
Let's also just assume that we're starting from scratch right now.

00:24.787 --> 00:33.937
Well, because right now we're recording for the first time, so I'm just going to assume that we didn't even talk the last time, but go ahead, by all means.

00:33.957 --> 00:53.680
Well, it's just that when I spoke of selling my collection to University of Maryland, I didn't want to give any impression that I'm talking about first edition, because the only possibly rare item was Jasper Woods, that publication here of the Spanish Earth, and it was just my sixth

00:54.098 --> 00:58.543
I kept one shelf, six shelves of books.

00:58.563 --> 01:08.554
And then another thing, when I mentioned about my job as index supervisor at McGraw-Hill, I don't know if I sounded like I prepared the indexes.

01:09.035 --> 01:13.640
What I did, not all I did, it was a big job.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.085
What I did was I edited the author's indexes for college division.

01:18.105 --> 01:18.846
I see.

01:19.086 --> 01:24.072
TMRB, professional and reference books, and then made assignments for freelance indexes.

01:24.524 --> 01:44.946
McGraw-Hill's policy was that an author could always ask to have a freelancer do it, but if they submitted anything, I mean, they could submit six or eight pages for an index, and then, you know, I had to really build it to make it an adequate index.

01:45.584 --> 01:52.559
And, of course, sometimes then there would be hundreds and hundreds of pages, and then they would need editing some style.

01:53.080 --> 01:53.481
I see.

01:55.245 --> 02:02.881
Well, why don't we just start from the beginning, if it's okay with you, and then we'll just get to that material.

02:03.463 --> 02:05.567
No, but I've got two other points.

02:05.952 --> 02:11.238
In Tom's letter, my sister moved to New York three years after me.

02:12.019 --> 02:15.684
She rented her house and planned to stay for a year, and she stayed 19 years.

02:16.625 --> 02:20.670
And she thought Tom greatly overdid the references to her.

02:20.690 --> 02:27.218
But the really main thing is that it was Lester Hemingway, not Carlos Saker, that I...

02:27.535 --> 02:29.697
met at the New York Public Library.

02:29.897 --> 02:30.277
Okay.

02:30.377 --> 02:31.919
Anyway, as you say, we'll take it in.

02:31.939 --> 02:53.958
Okay, well, so why don't we just, I think, I'd just like to do it as a story almost, and maybe you can just tell me how you came to do this work on Hemingway, and maybe just start where you think it's appropriate, and then if it's okay, I'll ask you a couple questions, but why don't we just start very comfortably with how this project came into being, the inspiration for it.

02:54.238 --> 02:56.260
Probably, because I've always loved to read.

02:57.050 --> 03:06.145
And we were poor, and we couldn't go anywhere on summer vacations or anything, so I always read.

03:07.186 --> 03:14.999
And then in 1953, my mother injured her back, and I had to give up my job.

03:15.079 --> 03:16.702
It was just a clerical job.

03:16.762 --> 03:18.665
I didn't have any secretarial skills.

03:18.685 --> 03:19.426
This was in New York?

03:19.787 --> 03:21.269
No, this was in Kansas City.

03:21.509 --> 03:23.833
Okay, so why don't we...

03:24.100 --> 03:27.864
I've got Tom's letter in front of me, but now you're from Iowa, is that right?

03:28.745 --> 03:30.227
Born in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

03:30.247 --> 03:31.108
Council Bluffs, Iowa.

03:31.128 --> 03:31.248
Right.

03:31.869 --> 03:33.731
And what year was that, if you don't mind telling me?

03:33.991 --> 03:37.255
That was July 27, 1926.

03:37.735 --> 03:38.156
I see.

03:38.256 --> 03:38.997
Okay.

03:39.097 --> 03:40.398
That was 70 years ago.

03:40.739 --> 03:40.819
Wow.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.161
Oh, you've got a birthday coming up.

03:44.303 --> 03:48.287
And so you went to New York, and so you went to high school, and you went to schools.

03:48.868 --> 03:49.388
Let's see.

03:49.408 --> 03:51.671
Now, can I ask you?

03:51.951 --> 03:52.272
Sure.

03:52.292 --> 03:53.533
For the sake of accuracy,

03:53.834 --> 03:56.839
Could you word it with only a high school education?

03:58.541 --> 04:01.085
Here's the situation.

04:01.125 --> 04:05.131
I'd taken a college prep course and made the honor roll one year.

04:05.151 --> 04:06.934
But my father died when I was 16.

04:07.134 --> 04:08.917
I knew there was no way I could go to college.

04:09.438 --> 04:19.032
So then my sister moved to Kansas City to go to the Art Institute, and mother and I joined her, and I transferred to a high school here in Kansas City for my senior year.

04:19.585 --> 04:21.167
And mother became ill.

04:21.227 --> 04:24.372
She had been ill ever since I was three years old, actually.

04:24.392 --> 04:31.942
But she became ill, and then I didn't finish.

04:31.962 --> 04:35.086
And then after the war, I took some classes to make up.

04:35.487 --> 04:37.710
But you were now, at this point, living in Kansas City?

04:38.010 --> 04:38.831
In Kansas City.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.574
And what year did you move there, do you think?

04:41.255 --> 04:45.320
Oh, we moved there in 42 or 43.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.001
1942.

04:46.362 --> 04:47.263
Yeah.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.521
During the war?

04:50.284 --> 04:51.345
I'd say it was 1943.

04:51.486 --> 04:53.568
Okay, so it was during the war.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.093
And so you finished high school in Kansas City.

04:58.916 --> 05:03.021
But I didn't actually ever graduate.

05:03.282 --> 05:03.963
From high school?

05:04.223 --> 05:04.443
Right.

05:05.024 --> 05:15.799
See, I made up... When Mother became ill, I had to leave in my senior year, and then I took classes.

05:16.100 --> 05:26.052
They had classes for ex-servicemen, and I took some of those, but didn't ever actually, you know, let's say I don't have a diploma.

05:26.672 --> 05:39.407
I was at high school in Conflux for three years, and that's what I've always put down on every resume, and it's never really come up.

05:40.012 --> 06:01.733
My sister and I both had jobs that required a college education, and we didn't have college, and people just assumed we did, and then after I moved to New York in 1959, and then I attended lectures at NYU and classes at the New School, so that

06:04.902 --> 06:12.312
And then in 1959, I signed up for Carolyn Gordon's Techniques of Fiction because it included Farewell to Arms.

06:13.053 --> 06:18.701
And I was so looking forward to a discussion about it because I never had an opportunity to discuss his work with anyone.

06:19.562 --> 06:25.290
But at the end of the session on Ford Maddox Ford, she had been his secretary in Paris.

06:25.726 --> 06:26.307
And Ms.

06:26.327 --> 06:29.872
Gordon said instead of Hemingway, we'd spend a second week on four.

06:30.754 --> 06:39.768
So after the class, I told her, you know, of my interest in Hemingway's work, and she said, you can learn all you need to know about Hemingway by reading his books.

06:40.409 --> 06:43.313
You know, I mean, you know, I'd all read him.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.056
I had already read them all.

06:46.176 --> 06:48.058
Tell me a little bit.

06:48.078 --> 06:51.443
You didn't graduate high school, but you had this passion for reading.

06:51.523 --> 06:52.004
Is that right?

06:52.785 --> 06:54.988
That is just about the size of it, yes.

06:55.309 --> 06:59.514
And would you say that your interest primarily was in fiction or in everything?

06:59.715 --> 07:01.157
No, biographies, actually.

07:02.479 --> 07:08.507
I mean, I've read a lot of fiction, goodness me, but I always loved it.

07:09.753 --> 07:11.014
I loved reading biographies.

07:11.195 --> 07:18.764
Well, can you name some of the things without, you don't have to be specific about the titles, but what kinds of lives were you interested in, just lives in general?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.766
Writers' lives.

07:20.786 --> 07:21.587
Writers' lives.

07:22.468 --> 07:24.611
So how is it that you were attracted?

07:24.731 --> 07:26.893
Now, did you read from the time you were a little girl?

07:27.354 --> 07:28.275
Oh, I did, yes.

07:28.395 --> 07:35.844
And I always, as I said, we were poor, but for Christmas and my birthday, I got a book on each occasion.

07:36.585 --> 07:38.427
Did you ask or were they surprises?

07:38.947 --> 07:40.630
Did you ask for certain books?

07:41.411 --> 07:42.332
No, I had to ask.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.736
So what kinds of things did you ask for?

07:44.756 --> 07:45.317
Do you remember?

07:46.319 --> 08:01.242
Well, like, actually, it was a series of, I know I received that series of Madeleine Brandeis' books, things like Little Tony of Italy and the Little Spanish Fisher, and, oh, it was a whole series.

08:02.104 --> 08:02.845
But...

08:04.090 --> 08:08.537
Now, did your mother have a passion for reading as well?

08:08.557 --> 08:08.617
No.

08:09.298 --> 08:13.305
Not other than the newspaper.

08:13.345 --> 08:18.954
My father, the situation was, my father graduated from college.

08:19.415 --> 08:19.675
Where?

08:20.296 --> 08:22.260
In Northwestern College.

08:22.280 --> 08:22.941
In Chicago.

08:23.882 --> 08:25.465
No, that one's in, I think, Naperville.

08:25.485 --> 08:26.206
Is it in Naperville?

08:26.526 --> 08:27.829
It's not the university.

08:27.849 --> 08:28.069
I see.

08:28.089 --> 08:28.950
It was the college.

08:29.852 --> 08:30.553
And...

08:30.922 --> 08:38.012
And mother was orphaned when she lost her mother when she was nine and her father when she was 12.

08:38.092 --> 08:44.822
And the five children were taken out of school and put to work by an aunt.

08:45.363 --> 08:45.964
Well, anyway.

08:46.124 --> 08:47.866
Well, were they Midwesterners, by the way?

08:49.449 --> 08:51.952
Dad was from Iowa and mother was from St.

08:51.972 --> 08:52.573
Louis.

08:53.554 --> 08:55.377
And then she worked at the telephone company.

08:55.711 --> 08:59.375
through her whole 20s, the whole 19... Mrs. and Council Bluffs.

08:59.395 --> 09:00.477
...in St.

09:00.517 --> 09:00.817
Louis.

09:01.158 --> 09:01.518
I see.

09:01.678 --> 09:03.581
Until she married.

09:04.181 --> 09:14.474
But the thing was, my great-grandfather came over from Darmstadt in... Could you spell that for me?

09:15.155 --> 09:16.016
D-A-R-M.

09:16.677 --> 09:16.857
Uh-huh.

09:17.237 --> 09:17.598
S-T-A-D-T.

09:18.018 --> 09:19.140
S-T-A-D-T.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.842
S-T-A-D-T.

09:20.862 --> 09:21.562
Okay, thank you.

09:22.143 --> 09:24.486
Around 1850.

09:24.837 --> 09:48.769
and uh they went to this is maternal grandfather of course no paternal paternal paternal okay yes uh and uh went to uh lancaster pennsylvania and then they went out to indiana and then they took the covered wagon to iowa and and uh ended up on the on the western border there of iowa and um

09:49.171 --> 09:52.855
And then my grandfather was born in Indiana in 1855.

09:52.935 --> 09:55.779
This is, again, your paternal.

09:56.019 --> 09:57.100
This is all paternal.

09:57.301 --> 09:58.823
Right.

09:59.443 --> 10:15.162
But the only point I'm making is that they settled in Iowa, worked awfully hard, grandfather worked awfully hard, and then my father and his older brother,

10:15.749 --> 10:20.695
lost it all in land swindle.

10:20.876 --> 10:25.982
They bought land in Colorado and were swindled out a bit around 1920.

10:26.363 --> 10:27.364
Oh my goodness.

10:27.524 --> 10:30.048
And he was completely defeated.

10:30.248 --> 10:32.070
What kind of work did your grandfather do?

10:33.732 --> 10:43.545
My grandfather had been a farmer and then he owned a butcher shop and a hardware store and a

10:44.757 --> 10:47.601
So he was a businessman.

10:47.882 --> 10:48.563
After the war.

10:50.426 --> 10:54.151
My father was second lieutenant in France during the war.

10:54.572 --> 10:55.754
World War I, we're talking.

10:56.034 --> 10:56.395
Right.

10:56.915 --> 11:00.901
But I'm afraid I'm saying this with a garble.

11:01.222 --> 11:06.630
But the two points are that mother was orphaned young.

11:07.167 --> 11:17.939
Dad had a college education and should have been well off, but instead everything was lost and he was a very defeated man.

11:18.440 --> 11:31.875
Your father worked for the Union Pacific as a railway clerk for 42 cents an hour to support six people, a family of six.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.543
There wasn't that many options.

11:35.485 --> 11:40.235
I mean, reading was something that was available.

11:41.297 --> 11:41.597
Follow?

11:41.938 --> 11:43.100
Yeah.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.705
Did you have a good public library available to you?

11:45.825 --> 11:47.809
Excellent Carnegie Library.

11:48.030 --> 11:48.370
Oh, good.

11:48.390 --> 11:50.575
I'm going to write about Carnegie Libraries in this new book.

11:50.635 --> 11:51.537
That's good.

11:51.557 --> 11:52.939
Oh, good.

11:52.959 --> 11:54.302
Yeah, excellent.

11:54.620 --> 11:56.742
Yes, I started going there very young.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.425
Now, you mentioned this is again in Council Bluffs, right?

11:59.745 --> 12:00.025
Right.

12:00.045 --> 12:00.406
Okay.

12:00.766 --> 12:04.850
And you mentioned a family of six, so you have, I gather, three siblings?

12:05.691 --> 12:05.871
Right.

12:05.931 --> 12:08.634
My older sister, and then there are two boys, and then myself.

12:08.874 --> 12:09.154
Okay.

12:09.174 --> 12:11.116
Could you name the siblings for me?

12:11.977 --> 12:14.299
I know your sister's name, but why don't you tell me anyway?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.402
Oh, and then Gordon and Homer.

12:17.422 --> 12:18.363
Okay.

12:18.403 --> 12:19.244
Homer and Gordon.

12:19.264 --> 12:20.826
It's Marjorie or Margaret?

12:21.326 --> 12:22.167
No, it's Marjorie.

12:22.547 --> 12:23.108
M-A-R-R?

12:23.577 --> 12:24.678
J-O-R-Y.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.419
J-O-R-Y.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.440
Okay.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.662
J-O-R-R-I-E.

12:27.682 --> 12:28.282
Okay, good.

12:28.302 --> 12:31.045
See, I have to ask these questions, right?

12:31.065 --> 12:31.185
Sure.

12:31.706 --> 12:33.728
Okay, and where do you fit in here?

12:34.249 --> 12:34.930
I'm the youngest.

12:34.950 --> 12:35.670
You're the youngest.

12:36.351 --> 12:37.032
Right.

12:37.052 --> 12:53.230
And one of my regrets about the bibliography is that when I was in high school, I dropped the Y from my name, and...

12:53.480 --> 12:59.847
I wish now that I had used my middle name, Louise, or else put the Y back on.

13:00.168 --> 13:01.369
Now, why did you drop the Y?

13:01.930 --> 13:04.212
Oh, for rather foolish reasons.

13:04.873 --> 13:11.841
I went in and told the registrar to drop the Y, but my grandfather... Now, the registrar of what now?

13:11.961 --> 13:12.642
At high school.

13:12.782 --> 13:13.603
I see.

13:13.623 --> 13:17.968
And she did it, and the...

13:18.202 --> 13:20.204
My grandfather had set a precedent.

13:20.224 --> 13:23.208
He had dropped the second N on the end of our name.

13:23.968 --> 13:32.558
So that, oh, one of the reasons was that I wanted to use that Greek E at the end of Audrey and have a nice little curling.

13:33.359 --> 13:39.305
When you see my signature, you'll see one of the foolish reasons.

13:39.886 --> 13:43.490
Okay, well, so there was a, you were what age when you did this?

13:44.131 --> 13:45.792
Oh, goodness, I must have been maybe 15.

13:45.812 --> 13:46.814
15?

13:48.075 --> 13:48.175
Yeah.

13:48.526 --> 13:50.629
So what did you think about at the age of 15?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.351
Did you have ideas and dreams?

13:52.892 --> 14:00.362
At 13, I believe I told you, I wanted nothing more than to go to New York to the New York World's Fair.

14:00.903 --> 14:09.435
And after that, it was just a real big thing to go.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.157
This was like 1939, right?

14:12.138 --> 14:12.980
Right.

14:13.741 --> 14:14.622
Right.

14:14.642 --> 14:18.347
So that, and then let's see, I think it was 49 when I...

14:18.749 --> 14:25.155
when I did go on a tour that included New York City.

14:25.876 --> 14:33.603
And then, let's see, I visited again in 51, and then moved there in 59.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.567
Did you have a clear idea of what you wanted to do with your life?

14:39.709 --> 14:40.249
I really did.

14:40.289 --> 14:41.791
I wanted to write novels.

14:41.811 --> 14:42.151
You did?

14:42.171 --> 14:42.812
I did.

14:43.492 --> 14:43.773
Mm-hmm.

14:44.614 --> 14:44.894
Uh-huh.

14:44.974 --> 14:46.675
Yeah, I wanted to be a novelist.

14:46.936 --> 14:47.416
Really?

14:47.716 --> 14:48.317
And...

14:48.938 --> 14:56.807
And then when, well, I'll get to that.

14:56.827 --> 14:59.971
But anyway, let's get back to 1953.

15:00.371 --> 15:04.636
That's when.

15:04.797 --> 15:04.957
Ms.

15:04.997 --> 15:07.059
Hanuman, could you just forgive me for just a second?

15:07.119 --> 15:09.362
I want to get a notepad here that I should have.

15:09.382 --> 15:10.063
Oh, absolutely.

15:10.083 --> 15:10.764
I'll be right with you.

15:10.804 --> 15:12.466
I should have a notepad here, and I don't.

15:12.486 --> 15:15.349
So just give me 20 seconds, and I'll be right back.

15:15.809 --> 15:16.330
Okay.

15:17.812 --> 15:19.054
I have to think about something.

15:19.074 --> 15:28.187
When I was in the eighth grade, we had a hobby class, and the council left Montmorelle.

15:28.788 --> 15:29.930
I still got the little clipping.

15:30.451 --> 15:39.244
So my hobby, I had a little notebook where I copied biographies into it.

15:39.424 --> 15:43.650
Well, they'd just be little brief summaries.

15:44.086 --> 15:52.335
And so I'm quoted, this is a great quote, I'm quoted in the paper saying, I simply like to study about others.

15:52.976 --> 15:58.281
You know, I mean, that's kind of... When was this quote made?

15:58.682 --> 16:00.664
That was when I was in the eighth grade.

16:00.684 --> 16:01.064
Really?

16:01.305 --> 16:08.793
Seventh or eighth in the... I see.

16:08.813 --> 16:13.738
I just now thought about that because you asked me how early I... Well...

16:14.258 --> 16:15.139
Go ahead.

16:15.159 --> 16:16.941
Okay, let me just ask a couple questions.

16:17.682 --> 16:19.565
You say that you wanted to be a novelist.

16:20.926 --> 16:22.428
Who were your favorite writers?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.591
Did you have models?

16:27.054 --> 16:32.841
Oh, yes, and they all had three names, and I can't think of any off the top of my head.

16:33.202 --> 16:40.431
All of those... Oh, golly, I'd have to think of that.

16:41.232 --> 16:43.675
If you ask me my favorite novelist...

16:43.975 --> 16:48.342
Today, Jane Austen has been for over 20 years.

16:50.325 --> 16:55.373
But when you went to the library and you brought home books, you brought home a lot of novels?

16:56.796 --> 16:57.397
Probably.

16:57.978 --> 17:01.002
Probably a lot of fiction, a lot of biographies, history.

17:01.123 --> 17:01.343
I've always

17:01.762 --> 17:06.411
I've always been enlisted in history, especially the Regency.

17:06.672 --> 17:08.616
But no, that wasn't a billion counts of love.

17:09.438 --> 17:12.343
Now, did you read late at night?

17:13.305 --> 17:15.610
No, that wasn't until Kansas City then.

17:15.811 --> 17:17.414
Okay, but did you read late at night?

17:17.454 --> 17:20.500
Did you kind of stay awake or even as a little girl?

17:20.560 --> 17:23.466
I loved it very much.

17:24.003 --> 17:26.511
I stand up to bed pretty early.

17:26.732 --> 17:32.009
No, probably weekends and vacation.

17:32.149 --> 17:35.620
I read my way through summer vacations, let's put it that way.

17:36.102 --> 17:37.185
You read your way.

17:38.532 --> 17:45.019
Okay, so now let's kind of come a little closer now to the Hemingway Project, if we can.

17:45.059 --> 17:46.021
So you're in New York.

17:47.182 --> 17:49.945
You finally moved to the... No, not yet.

17:50.005 --> 17:50.586
You're too quick.

17:50.606 --> 17:51.006
Okay.

17:51.086 --> 17:51.787
You've jumped ahead.

17:52.208 --> 17:52.308
Okay.

17:52.528 --> 18:01.098
Then in 1953, and my mother injured her back, and that's when I had to give up my job, and I was home for over five years, and that's when it all started.

18:01.118 --> 18:02.299
This is now in Kansas City.

18:02.339 --> 18:03.561
It was in Kansas City.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.763
And the job you had to give up once again was?

18:05.783 --> 18:08.286
Oh, it was a clerical job at...

18:08.705 --> 18:10.508
I was at Kansas City Life then.

18:10.608 --> 18:12.671
No, I was at American Herford Association.

18:13.412 --> 18:14.593
And this is in Kansas City?

18:14.914 --> 18:15.214
Right.

18:16.055 --> 18:16.276
Uh-huh.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.038
Okay, it's like a secretarial job, right?

18:18.559 --> 18:18.699
Uh-huh.

18:18.719 --> 18:20.041
It's like a secretarial job?

18:20.061 --> 18:20.261
No, no.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.483
Strictly clerical.

18:21.543 --> 18:23.566
I didn't have any secretarial skills.

18:23.586 --> 18:24.828
I've always had clerical.

18:24.908 --> 18:29.955
I've had like a data writer at Kansas City Life Insurance Company.

18:30.375 --> 18:35.202
This was keeping records of Herford's...

18:35.738 --> 18:41.545
I had to name them sometimes, just, you know, cattle records.

18:42.245 --> 18:43.847
And then... Cattle records?

18:44.728 --> 18:44.908
Uh-huh.

18:44.928 --> 18:45.749
That's great.

18:45.769 --> 18:46.430
Okay.

18:46.450 --> 18:48.613
And then you'd have to name them, and that was fun.

18:49.954 --> 18:56.702
If the cattle breeder hadn't, you know, if he hadn't named them, and then they came down through a line.

18:57.383 --> 19:05.712
But anyway, and even when I went to New York at American Heritage, my first job there, see, it was just, it was simply clerical at a book club.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.437
I was at American Heritage in New York, right?

19:09.457 --> 19:10.939
And what year was that, 53?

19:10.959 --> 19:12.481
No, no.

19:12.541 --> 19:12.761
59?

19:13.082 --> 19:13.963
Yeah, 59.

19:14.303 --> 19:14.904
Okay.

19:15.945 --> 19:18.389
Okay, so again, let's go back for the five years.

19:18.469 --> 19:19.870
In 53 then.

19:20.491 --> 19:26.199
And then so while my sister supported us, I took care of mothers, you know, cared for mothers.

19:26.559 --> 19:33.488
And then instead of just continuing on random reading, like I'd always done,

19:33.620 --> 19:35.863
Well, I began reading the books.

19:35.883 --> 19:40.349
I found this book's list of 100 great books.

19:40.369 --> 19:43.433
And I'd only read... I don't know how many of them I'd read.

19:44.935 --> 19:52.586
But when it came to Farewell to Arm, instead of continuing the list, I began reading everything about Hemingway.

19:52.606 --> 19:54.528
I just went on a tangent.

19:55.970 --> 20:01.438
Everything in the Kansas City Library, and they borrowed books for me from the Interlibrary Loan Service.

20:02.239 --> 20:03.120
And then at some...

20:03.455 --> 20:09.325
At the time, because there wasn't one, I decided to do a biography.

20:09.906 --> 20:11.388
You decided to write a biography?

20:11.408 --> 20:13.692
To write a biography of Hemingway.

20:13.892 --> 20:18.961
You weren't intimidated by the enormity of how formidable this might be?

20:20.944 --> 20:29.378
You know, what Jerry Frank says in here,

20:29.847 --> 20:38.039
I was just reading what I told him, and it was certainly the truth.

20:38.761 --> 20:45.591
I told him, quote, oh, I thought it would be a great idea, and I started to work on it.

20:46.092 --> 20:58.150
However, I found myself writing little transitional sentences linking great chunks of Hemingway, and for some reason, the transitional passages didn't come up for what he said.

20:58.282 --> 21:01.310
You'll see it.

21:01.330 --> 21:07.768
It didn't come up to Hemingway's writing, so I abandoned that.

21:08.086 --> 21:10.550
You abandoned the biography.

21:10.590 --> 21:15.016
How were you going to get the details of his life?

21:15.076 --> 21:16.218
Had you given that any thought?

21:16.759 --> 21:19.964
I was allowed access to the Kansas City Stars file.

21:20.104 --> 21:20.404
Really?

21:20.444 --> 21:23.008
So you actually did kind of proceed with it a little bit.

21:23.349 --> 21:32.162
They're always so proud that he had that apprenticeship on their paper in 1917, 1918.

21:32.903 --> 21:36.067
And then when I would take my mother to visit in St.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.249
Louis, then I...

21:37.567 --> 21:41.731
had access to the Post-Dispatch and the Globe Center.

21:41.751 --> 21:45.014
So you actually did kind of take some steps then, didn't you?

21:45.034 --> 22:04.772
I, let's say that I, and then any articles, any, everything by and, oh, and see what I, it was really brilliant what I was doing because I was taking all of the biographical

22:05.123 --> 22:13.058
information from like Green Hills of Africa and the short stories and

22:13.898 --> 22:20.645
You know, then, as I say, but the transitional passages fell, they were completely inadequate.

22:21.226 --> 22:27.572
Well, let's go, this was a book called The 100 Great Books, or The 100, what are... A list of 100 great books.

22:27.592 --> 22:29.815
Do you remember whose list it was, or was it just a list?

22:30.355 --> 22:32.457
No, I really don't.

22:32.477 --> 22:38.183
I had a note someplace that I got a quarter of the way through it, but... But it was a list.

22:38.203 --> 22:42.808
Was it a book, or was it just a list that you'd read someplace?

22:43.632 --> 22:45.795
You don't remember whether or not it was in a book?

22:45.915 --> 22:48.519
I don't know if it was in Reader's Digest.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.642
I really don't remember.

22:50.743 --> 22:52.345
It might have been Reader's Digest?

22:52.986 --> 22:54.849
I mean, you're saying it might have been.

22:54.869 --> 22:56.691
It might have been.

22:56.952 --> 22:59.275
And these were not summaries of the books.

22:59.335 --> 23:00.857
Oh, no, it was just a list.

23:01.058 --> 23:01.979
A list of the titles.

23:02.039 --> 23:06.626
So what prompted you to pause at Hemingway?

23:07.988 --> 23:10.011
Oh, once I had read A Farewell to Arms.

23:10.379 --> 23:11.520
No one else.

23:11.780 --> 23:14.323
Well, were you reading all the books on this list?

23:14.443 --> 23:16.606
I was going through.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.969
And you were going to attempt to read all of them, right?

23:20.370 --> 23:21.030
Oh, absolutely.

23:21.271 --> 23:24.294
And was this kind of like an education you were giving yourself, do you think?

23:24.914 --> 23:26.196
I think very much so.

23:27.077 --> 23:27.858
Very much so.

23:28.298 --> 23:36.707
Because I don't think anyone else has ever understood this, but I think that what drew me to Hemingway's writing

23:37.497 --> 23:40.800
was that he actually was a teacher.

23:42.602 --> 23:46.405
Like, one of my great favorites is Big Two-Hearted River.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.269
And he went into detail about fishing.

23:50.369 --> 23:54.233
He went into detail about the bullfights.

23:55.214 --> 23:59.798
He was teaching you all the time in his books.

24:00.078 --> 24:01.960
And I needed that.

24:03.521 --> 24:04.823
So that, well, anyway.

24:04.963 --> 24:06.124
What do you mean, I needed that?

24:06.664 --> 24:07.285
Well, I...

24:07.484 --> 24:09.907
I should have gone to college.

24:10.007 --> 24:14.813
I should have gone, I should have, I would have loved, I always loved school.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.976
I was on an honor roll one year.

24:16.996 --> 24:23.644
I was, you know, I missed a lot of school all through my grade school.

24:23.764 --> 24:36.259
I had to stay home with Mother, but... Would you feel, if I were to say, do you feel that this is one of the great omissions in your life, is that you weren't able to study as much as you might like to have?

24:36.458 --> 24:51.653
Oh, I regret it very much that it wasn't a time when, like my grandniece, she has this marvelous scholarship at William Woods College here in Missouri on her softball.

24:51.874 --> 25:00.402
She is a great little pitcher, and the team ranks number five in the nation.

25:00.462 --> 25:00.863
Wow.

25:01.503 --> 25:06.128
And, I mean, I just think that's marvelous, you know, to have...

25:07.238 --> 25:13.048
to have that chance for her to go to school with a scholarship like that.

25:13.809 --> 25:22.564
But anyway, the opportunity wasn't there, and so I did what I could.

25:23.907 --> 25:28.635
Well, so now you were reading this list of the 100 great books.

25:29.777 --> 25:31.660
You came across Hemingway,

25:31.977 --> 25:36.040
And you became absorbed in Hemingway, apparently.

25:36.481 --> 25:41.085
That is a good, that's the right word, yes.

25:41.525 --> 25:47.710
And now you were not only reading everything he had written, but I would assume everything you could read about him, is that correct?

25:47.730 --> 25:49.292
That is, right.

25:49.312 --> 25:52.515
And so this is still while you're back home in Kansas City, right?

25:53.435 --> 25:54.236
Right.

25:54.256 --> 26:01.242
And then I went up to Oak Park, made a couple trips up to Oak Park,

26:01.694 --> 26:03.801
in 1953, 1954.

26:03.921 --> 26:12.750
And then in 1955, I made the first day of my first research trip to New York.

26:13.085 --> 26:21.654
in the reading room of the New York Public Library, and I recognized the man sitting across the table from me as Hemingway's brother, Lester.

26:21.814 --> 26:22.495
Come on.

26:22.535 --> 26:26.219
Now, I mean, that is one coincidence.

26:26.259 --> 26:27.981
Well, how did you know it was he?

26:28.361 --> 26:42.957
Well, I passed him a note, asking him if he was who I thought he was, and he stood up, and he was a very big man, and he said it right out loud, and I, of course, at the time, I whispered in libraries,

26:43.207 --> 26:44.971
And he says, where the hell did I meet you?

26:45.031 --> 26:49.279
So I went around the table and told him I recognized him from the photo.

26:49.981 --> 26:55.873
The photo was on the dust jacket of his novel, The Sound of the Trumpet.

26:55.893 --> 26:58.498
So he was working under a deadline.

26:58.850 --> 27:03.874
And so he said that he could give me an hour at lunch, you know, later in the book.

27:03.894 --> 27:06.036
Now, his picture was on the dust check of the what book?

27:06.677 --> 27:08.699
Oh, his novel, The Sound of the Trumpet.

27:09.019 --> 27:11.261
This is Hemingway's brother wrote a novel?

27:11.461 --> 27:12.662
This is Lester Hemingway.

27:12.682 --> 27:13.463
See, I didn't know this.

27:13.803 --> 27:14.984
Yeah.

27:15.004 --> 27:27.135
So you weren't only interested just in Ernest, you were interested in... Well, no, see, The Sound of the Trumpet was a World War II novel, and Ernest was one of the main characters.

27:27.588 --> 27:29.170
But, of course, under another name.

27:30.472 --> 27:36.840
But, oh, and it was so maddening because I would ask Les, I had a whole lot of questions.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.884
I would ask him, what did he mean by this, you know, or that?

27:39.904 --> 27:43.028
Well, so, okay, so this is the first day you go to New York.

27:43.248 --> 27:45.431
Right, I go to the first day of my, right.

27:45.591 --> 27:47.914
And now we're up to 1959?

27:48.314 --> 27:50.237
No, no, this is 1955.

27:50.297 --> 27:52.219
So this is just a trip.

27:52.940 --> 27:54.422
A research trip, yeah.

27:54.402 --> 27:58.850
And so you're about, let me just figure here, you're about 28 years old about this time, right?

27:58.870 --> 27:59.411
26, 27.

27:59.551 --> 28:00.533
Let's see, is that right?

28:01.294 --> 28:05.662
Let's see, in 56 I would be... Close to 30, yeah.

28:05.922 --> 28:07.024
Wait a minute.

28:07.044 --> 28:08.828
Oh, goodness, isn't that terrible?

28:12.554 --> 28:14.217
Uh...

28:15.023 --> 28:16.505
Oh, I was close to 30, yeah.

28:17.006 --> 28:18.748
Oh, yeah, sure, because this is 55.

28:18.788 --> 28:22.974
Okay, so now you were just going on a trip, right?

28:23.715 --> 28:25.197
On the research.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.219
Now your sister was there already, right?

28:27.319 --> 28:28.221
Oh, no, no.

28:28.661 --> 28:30.584
So she didn't come until after I moved.

28:30.624 --> 28:30.884
I see.

28:30.904 --> 28:35.150
Okay, so you went, and how long did you make this trip for?

28:35.210 --> 28:43.461
See, when she would give up her vacation days to stay with Mother so I could make these trips,

28:44.167 --> 28:46.830
So I probably stayed four or five days.

28:47.491 --> 28:50.355
And you were actually thinking still about doing a biography.

28:50.935 --> 28:52.798
Right, right.

28:52.818 --> 28:53.939
Okay.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.662
And what did you think that you'd find in New York?

28:58.865 --> 28:59.886
What kinds of material?

29:00.667 --> 29:05.894
Everything that I couldn't find at the Kansas City Library.

29:06.314 --> 29:07.556
But like in terms of what?

29:08.937 --> 29:10.419
Published material or what?

29:10.599 --> 29:11.220
Just...

29:11.943 --> 29:14.826
A biography, of course, of the details of the life.

29:15.727 --> 29:22.154
See, every book, like Philip Young's book, had he let that come out yet?

29:22.234 --> 29:22.934
I'm not sure.

29:22.954 --> 29:33.025
But anyway, every book had footnotes, and I have followed up footnotes all my life.

29:33.586 --> 29:34.406
I'm still doing it.

29:35.187 --> 29:38.811
But, oh yes, I knew there would be a great deal.

29:39.145 --> 29:43.211
in New York to check.

29:44.112 --> 29:47.036
So you went to New York and you went to the New York Public Library.

29:47.677 --> 29:48.378
That's wonderful.

29:49.880 --> 29:57.230
What amazes me is that you're traveling all the way from Kansas City to New York to go to the public library.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.052
Well, not really.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.394
I mean, it...

30:00.813 --> 30:02.696
I mean, think what a magnificent library is.

30:02.716 --> 30:03.477
Oh, no, this is great.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.640
You see, I'm writing about libraries in this new book.

30:05.660 --> 30:19.861
Remember, I went to over, or nearly 20 libraries while I was working on it, and I did a, oh, my, I did an enormous amount at the New York Public Library, and then, of course, a lot at the Library of Congress.

30:19.921 --> 30:21.483
I made many trips down there.

30:23.246 --> 30:28.153
It's just that no library has everything, and...

30:28.420 --> 30:33.288
So you've been working on this now for three, four, five years, right, at this particular point?

30:33.668 --> 30:34.550
No, no, this was 55.

30:34.991 --> 30:37.074
I'd only been on it for about two years.

30:37.715 --> 30:39.778
And you'd already been to about 20 libraries?

30:39.858 --> 30:40.560
No, no, no, no.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.004
No, no, that's... Okay.

30:43.224 --> 30:46.629
See, that's where I misspeak.

30:47.210 --> 30:54.462
As I said in my presence to the bibliography, doing the bibliography I worked in at...

30:55.572 --> 31:03.079
I made nearly 20 research trips and worked at over 40 libraries.

31:03.099 --> 31:03.479
I see, okay, okay.

31:03.499 --> 31:17.191
But no, at this point, I'd only gone up to Chicago, and the library's there, and I didn't go to Newberry until later Chicago trips.

31:18.592 --> 31:25.478
I'd been researched, by 55, I'd been to Oak Park and Chicago twice, and then I went

31:25.880 --> 31:26.501
to New York.

31:28.544 --> 31:32.089
And were you confident that you were getting enough material to start writing?

31:33.411 --> 31:34.132
Not really.

31:34.773 --> 31:35.374
Not really.

31:35.434 --> 31:41.803
I was just kind of wanting to, I couldn't get enough.

31:41.943 --> 31:45.429
I kept, you know, just reading more and more.

31:49.695 --> 31:55.363
But anyway, to get back to Les, he was working under a deadline and he was going to give me an hour later in the week.

31:55.495 --> 32:05.327
And so he took me to Costello's on 3rd Avenue to show me the shillelagh behind the bar that Hemingway broke over his head to win a bet with John O'Hara.

32:06.027 --> 32:08.310
Oh, I think that's so foolish.

32:08.791 --> 32:19.123
And anyway, so then we talked the whole afternoon, and he complimented me in saying that I knew more about Hemingway than any other living person.

32:19.441 --> 32:28.690
But he gave me some excellent leads to articles and gave me more in subsequent, you know, when we corresponded.

32:28.710 --> 32:29.431
Was he nice to you?

32:30.071 --> 32:31.233
Oh, he was very nice.

32:31.773 --> 32:35.857
Did you ask if you might at some point be able to meet with Ernest?

32:36.658 --> 32:49.110
Oh, he wanted me to fly right down to Cuba and meet Ernest, and it would have been a big, big mistake.

32:49.411 --> 32:50.273
No, no.

32:51.014 --> 32:52.477
Did you ever meet Ernest?

32:52.497 --> 32:53.079
Never did.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.562
Did you ever write him?

32:56.045 --> 32:58.229
Wrote once, never received a reply.

32:58.891 --> 33:03.661
So this project was done totally without either his knowledge or his approbation, right?

33:04.202 --> 33:04.983
Oh, absolutely.

33:06.326 --> 33:09.613
Were you a little shy, you think, about actually trying to get in touch with him?

33:10.252 --> 33:11.234
Oh, very much so.

33:11.654 --> 33:12.095
Very much so.

33:12.876 --> 33:20.769
And I just could not believe that he was going to welcome with open arms someone without a college.

33:20.989 --> 33:29.222
Of course, he didn't have a college degree himself, but someone without college who was going to do this work.

33:29.405 --> 33:30.628
biography of him.

33:30.969 --> 33:34.578
I mean, it just isn't realistic.

33:34.618 --> 33:39.931
So the idea of a bibliography still hadn't nucleated drag yet, right?

33:40.433 --> 33:41.355
No, it hadn't.

33:41.673 --> 33:45.578
But now you've met his brother, and you corresponded with the brother.

33:46.799 --> 33:47.080
Uh-huh.

33:47.540 --> 33:52.646
And would you think if that were Ernest sitting at the table in New York, do you think you'd have passed a note to him?

33:53.207 --> 33:56.070
Oh, I absolutely would have.

33:56.090 --> 33:57.532
Oh, yes.

33:57.752 --> 33:58.133
Oh, yes, yes.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.776
I wouldn't pass up the opportunity.

34:01.137 --> 34:09.807
It's just that... And then I had read enough to know that, I mean, I have never been one to...

34:11.035 --> 34:19.786
I don't drink or smoke, and I really have very low tolerance for drunkenness.

34:19.866 --> 34:35.364
I mean, I've never been an admirer of Fitzgerald after reading that about kicking the tray out of the waiter's hand and Hemingway shooting into that toilet at the Ritz in Paris.

34:36.085 --> 34:37.407
I mean, that kind of thing.

34:37.467 --> 34:37.667
Yeah.

34:37.900 --> 35:07.485
but now Hemingway was really quite the rebel rouser oh yes did this diminish him at all in your estimation no because see it was his writing his writing was really so important to me that and yet of course as I said the biography was only because it annoyed me that there wasn't one and

35:07.702 --> 35:15.756
And there should, you know, I felt like, well, then, you know, someone should do a biography.

35:16.397 --> 35:24.310
But even, see, what I was doing, I was just taking large chunks of his writing and putting them in.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.554
I mean, I wasn't...

35:26.905 --> 35:29.788
actually writing about him.

35:30.108 --> 35:35.854
And you weren't interviewing him, but were you trying to interview any other people who might have known him?

35:35.874 --> 35:37.196
No, I really wasn't.

35:37.416 --> 35:40.960
So I guess you kind of realized you really weren't going to do a biography.

35:42.361 --> 35:43.422
No, no.

35:43.682 --> 35:50.410
I think it involved as ambitious as it is the things that you did.

35:50.810 --> 35:53.773
Clearly, there was a lot more that you weren't going to

35:53.922 --> 35:59.069
No, I realized it was too ambitious a project.

35:59.229 --> 36:09.964
You know, well, let's say by 1957 or 8, but that didn't stop me from continuing to do research.

36:10.004 --> 36:23.423
So then when I did move to New York in 1959, and I had abandoned the idea of doing the biography, then I took this note, as I told you, it was a 6x9 note type, but 6x9.

36:23.740 --> 36:30.508
containing all my source material that I'd consulted in the five previous years.

36:30.949 --> 36:41.943
So I took that to Scribner's, and Harry Bragg was ever so nice, but he told me that Hemingway was absolutely against the bibliography being published during his lifetime.

36:42.984 --> 36:46.288
So then in 1961, after his suicide,

36:47.095 --> 36:58.471
I wrote to Mr. Bragg and I offered the information I had compiled to whoever would be doing a bibliography, you know, and I would have been happy for someone to use it.

36:59.232 --> 37:04.339
So then he informed me that no one was working on one.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.842
So you can imagine that.

37:07.278 --> 37:08.960
what my reaction was to that.

37:09.481 --> 37:10.462
What was your reaction?

37:10.802 --> 37:13.386
No one else is doing it.

37:13.406 --> 37:14.587
Yeah.

37:14.607 --> 37:18.452
So then I... So did you at this point perceive an opportunity?

37:19.333 --> 37:20.034
I did indeed.

37:20.855 --> 37:22.477
Yes, that's a good way to put it.

37:23.639 --> 37:36.475
And I spent all of 1962, the rest of 61 and all of 1962, I used up my savings and borrowed from my sister, who I later repaid, and worked on the bibliography.

37:36.978 --> 37:48.575
And then in February of 63, I got the job as indexer with Sweets Architectural and Industrial Catalogs, a division of Grand Hill.

37:49.316 --> 37:50.698
And then, can I tell you this?

37:50.718 --> 37:53.863
Incidentally, Malcolm Cowley worked for Sweets.

37:53.883 --> 37:55.525
It was probably 30 years earlier.

37:55.566 --> 38:03.998
And in one of his memoirs, he told how he was able to turn his attention to literary matters after the catalogs went to the printers in July...

38:04.282 --> 38:12.414
And that's just what I was able to obtain unpaid leaves of the absence for research trips after the catalogs went to the posters.

38:12.994 --> 38:21.306
It was a perfect job because it was almost like, you know, with school, and then you have your couple of months there summer vacation.

38:21.907 --> 38:29.578
So that I was able to, and then, and that's when I made a number of trips.

38:29.758 --> 38:33.664
And then in 1963, I took the enlarged

38:34.218 --> 38:42.034
The Godfrey, the Scribner's, and with my permission, which you may believe was gladly given, they sent it to Carlos Baker.

38:43.097 --> 38:51.855
And then Miriam Brokaw at the Princeton University Press wrote me and we set up an appointment.

38:52.342 --> 38:55.766
And they indicated their interest.

38:55.786 --> 39:00.471
So you sent it to Baker to help him with the preparation of his biography or just for him to look at?

39:00.771 --> 39:01.712
No, not at all.

39:02.393 --> 39:10.702
I took it to Scribman and they asked him permission to send it to Carlos Baker.

39:10.722 --> 39:18.450
And then he, you know, because they wanted his, see, he had done those checklists in his book.

39:19.139 --> 39:23.243
What's his book about Hemingway?

39:23.743 --> 39:25.645
Well, it says he did the biography, right?

39:26.345 --> 39:28.848
Not the biography, but his books.

39:46.764 --> 39:48.285
You know, he did his...

39:48.755 --> 39:54.381
Where's Hemingway?

39:54.401 --> 40:01.609
Naturally, I'm looking in the supplement instead of the biography.

40:01.629 --> 40:03.331
Well, let's not worry about that.

40:07.316 --> 40:09.999
At this point, was the bibliography pretty well complete?

40:11.821 --> 40:13.483
I'm held up.

40:13.723 --> 40:17.547
Oh, Hemingway, the writer is artist that went into so many editions.

40:17.695 --> 40:25.644
You know, and then, and, and, uh, Thomas Baker had the, uh, the checklist, uh, um, checklist in that.

40:25.725 --> 40:39.641
And of course, I, every, all of those items, I, you know, would then go to the library and look up and, and, uh, all of the, uh, and then of course all the book reviews I would, you know, at, at, at, um, New York Public Library.

40:40.142 --> 40:46.369
I'd, I'd even, McGraw Hill had that big green building there at 8th Avenue and 42nd Street.

40:46.670 --> 41:09.488
and at noon i would go i would go up i would walk up to the to the uh to the library spend a half an hour and uh or so and and walk back i mean it just uh uh i you know i just i

41:12.185 --> 41:17.171
You know, I think I've got all this index and having the time to find.

41:17.432 --> 41:21.256
Now, what are you referring to just out of curiosity right now?

41:21.316 --> 41:23.179
My 12 pages of notes.

41:23.199 --> 41:23.980
I see.

41:24.000 --> 41:33.091
I indexed them so that naturally I indexed them so I could find everything.

41:33.211 --> 41:35.414
Notes of what?

41:35.614 --> 41:40.540
I told my sister I feel like I've been cramming for an exam for two and a half days.

41:41.181 --> 41:41.922
Really?

41:42.188 --> 41:51.160
I've been writing all these notes, but... Okay, let's not worry about Carlos Baker.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.362
We can go back to that.

41:52.382 --> 41:54.124
Is he still alive?

41:54.925 --> 41:55.866
No, no.

41:55.886 --> 41:56.808
He passed away.

41:58.390 --> 41:58.870
Uh-huh.

41:59.311 --> 42:03.677
But, you know, I'm not a good person to ask who's alive and who isn't.

42:04.238 --> 42:09.765
I simply haven't kept track of...

42:10.387 --> 42:11.728
of all of that.

42:12.048 --> 42:14.651
Who would you say is the leading Hemingway scholar now?

42:15.952 --> 42:19.255
See, now again, I can't tell you that.

42:19.275 --> 42:25.520
Of course, Carlos was, and of course, William White was certainly very much so.

42:25.800 --> 42:39.212
I went out to Michigan to see his extensive collection, and at Suffer, his wife asked him why he wasn't doing the Hemingway bibliography.

42:39.412 --> 42:40.193
What did he say?

42:40.694 --> 42:44.802
And he had planned to when he came back from World War II.

42:44.862 --> 42:54.481
But it was simply a case where other things came up and he didn't do it.

42:54.581 --> 42:57.707
What did you see as the...

42:58.615 --> 43:01.700
the importance, the significance of a bibliography.

43:01.800 --> 43:11.474
Maybe we can talk a little bit about the process and what a bibliography is and how you visualized it.

43:12.135 --> 43:16.963
I mean, some people could say a bibliography is a list of all the books written by a writer, right?

43:17.583 --> 43:19.246
But it goes much deeper than that.

43:19.647 --> 43:23.633
And you had A, B, C, D, E items.

43:23.653 --> 43:26.597
You had all these different kinds of categories that you established.

43:27.168 --> 43:31.597
Let's just start, you know.

43:32.820 --> 43:41.818
Now, think of all the, not all of them, there hasn't been that many, but the book dealers who have written me and thanked me for doing it, that I've made their job so much.

43:41.959 --> 43:45.927
I know, I know, but you're jumping ahead to the conclusion, though.

43:45.947 --> 43:47.370
I'm just wondering about, you know.

43:47.350 --> 43:48.971
Because this is a lot of work.

43:49.051 --> 43:53.055
I mean, were you looking at this as a hobby or was it like a mission?

43:53.135 --> 43:59.280
Was it something that you thought might actually be a definition of a life's work?

44:00.101 --> 44:05.866
Let's put it, I always considered the bibliography a labor of love and the supplement just a labor.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.189
Just a labor for the supplement?

44:10.390 --> 44:10.930
Pardon?

44:10.970 --> 44:16.395
The bibliography was a labor of love and the supplement was... The supplement was just pure labor.

44:16.730 --> 44:31.437
By that time, I had this demanding job at McGraw Hill, and it was just very hard work.

44:35.064 --> 44:36.426
So you didn't enjoy it that much?

44:36.466 --> 44:39.452
Not the supplement.

44:39.472 --> 44:40.594
Not the supplement.

44:40.928 --> 44:56.426
Accepting that, I take that back, I was delighted to have a chance to list, oh, I had missed some very important items, and to have a chance to list, you know, my omissions.

44:56.986 --> 45:06.597
And then, again, you can imagine how much I enjoyed excerpting, you know, making small excerpts of the reviews.

45:07.298 --> 45:10.902
I mean, that's a delightful task to...

45:11.320 --> 45:12.983
to do that.

45:13.985 --> 45:23.481
It took quite a toll on the health.

45:23.622 --> 45:24.543
Is that right?

45:24.603 --> 45:25.565
Doing the supplements.

45:25.765 --> 45:26.066
Really?

45:26.306 --> 45:27.328
Yes, it really did.

45:28.310 --> 45:31.496
In what respect?

45:31.536 --> 45:35.202
Were you ill?

45:35.992 --> 45:38.135
Just pretty drained.

45:38.175 --> 45:39.557
Mm-hmm.

45:40.578 --> 45:44.144
I know at the time... Let me find something here.

45:44.164 --> 45:44.464
Roughly.

45:45.505 --> 45:45.946
Roughly.

45:45.966 --> 45:49.671
Eight, seven.

45:52.395 --> 45:52.916
Oh, yes.

45:52.936 --> 45:53.216
Yeah.

45:53.557 --> 45:53.837
Yes.

45:54.418 --> 46:05.053
Now, here's what I... No, my thoughts the other day was that between 1963 and 1966, and again in the early 1970s,

46:05.472 --> 46:18.249
With only minimal exaggeration, I devoted every lunch hour, evening, weekend, holiday, and most of my vacation days to working on the bibliography and then later the supplement.

46:18.270 --> 46:18.370
Wow.

46:18.930 --> 46:24.718
I was my own researcher, correspondence secretary, manuscript typist, indexer, proof feeder.

46:25.479 --> 46:34.011
I mean, it annoys me that I can't find any record of how large the manuscript was.

46:34.480 --> 46:38.507
I think it was at least 900 pages, it would be over 1,000.

46:39.228 --> 46:40.830
And can you believe it?

46:41.792 --> 46:47.942
Princeton University Press, they wanted to do it offset.

46:49.645 --> 46:59.982
They wanted a perfectly timed manuscript that they had done, and they had given me a copy to use it properly.

47:01.514 --> 47:13.077
You know, if I wanted to use it as a guide of Harvey's Ford Maddox Ford bibliography, which had been done offset, but sometimes...
