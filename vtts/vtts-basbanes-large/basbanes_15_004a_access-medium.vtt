WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:04.518
Um, he said there was a guy like that.

00:04.538 --> 00:14.510
Uh, the man's dead now, so I think I'm free to say, yes, he lived in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and, uh, uh, he was my first collector.

00:14.570 --> 00:18.395
I was a fairly young author, you know, and this was all very new and of flattering attention.

00:18.475 --> 00:23.601
He'd send me boxes of books, which I would sign, and then he ran a paper company, so he would send me paper.

00:23.681 --> 00:32.232
So for many years, I was able to use good quality, 20-weight, you know, rag, high rag content paper, free, for just signing these books, um,

00:32.920 --> 00:34.182
And it didn't seem burdensome.

00:35.244 --> 00:39.031
And I imagined that he and I had a great relationship, you know, over the years.

00:39.231 --> 00:45.562
And I was in Oshkosh because my son went to Lawrence University in Appleton, nearby Appleton.

00:47.125 --> 00:50.310
And I ran out of money as I was driving my boy out there.

00:50.711 --> 00:56.481
And I thought, well, I have a friend in Oshkosh, so I could find the paper company.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.987
And I popped in on him and said, I need somebody to cash a check.

01:00.067 --> 01:01.351
And he looked dumbfounded.

01:01.371 --> 01:05.180
You know, to have me materialize in this way as a real person.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.402
I didn't realize this was a real story.

01:06.422 --> 01:07.445
A needy person.

01:08.668 --> 01:12.076
And he didn't look entirely pleased because this wasn't how he saw me.

01:12.256 --> 01:13.018
Anyway, we did...

01:13.623 --> 01:19.729
He took me to his house, maybe on a later visit, and showed me my books, as in the case of Peterbush, isn't that right?

01:19.769 --> 01:25.614
They were all in a closet, beautifully cellophane, wrapped, and totally unread-looking.

01:25.634 --> 01:26.215
That's wonderful.

01:26.395 --> 01:27.436
With others, with others.

01:27.456 --> 01:27.776
That's right.

01:27.796 --> 01:28.717
He played me false.

01:29.338 --> 01:34.442
Well, I interviewed a guy out, and I went to visit a guy out in Springfield, Missouri, just last month.

01:34.462 --> 01:38.266
I'd read about him on the Washington Post, and they had mentioned my story in there.

01:39.187 --> 01:42.870
And this man, his name is you probably heard of him, Roland Comstock.

01:43.458 --> 01:45.341
He flies all over the country.

01:45.582 --> 01:52.274
He spends about anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 a year just flying to meet authors and have them sign his books.

01:52.855 --> 01:57.043
And then on top of that, he buys up the remainders of their first printings.

01:57.063 --> 02:01.551
He had one author of 1,000 copies, I swear, on pallets in his house.

02:01.683 --> 02:02.704
My God.

02:02.744 --> 02:05.227
He must have a big house, because books take up space.

02:05.247 --> 02:06.168
This is the Ozarks.

02:06.188 --> 02:08.190
He's got a lot of room.

02:08.210 --> 02:10.172
A lot of room in the Ozarks.

02:10.192 --> 02:10.972
Books, huh?

02:11.073 --> 02:19.041
Anyway, it's a... I've never met Mr. Comstock, I don't believe, although I've met a lot of book... I've met a lot of book and kooks, I will say.

02:20.602 --> 02:30.272
Well, just anything... When they asked by, it was here in the spring...

02:31.518 --> 02:34.081
She said, you really must see this one.

02:34.101 --> 02:39.127
Because I also mentioned her book, Possession.

02:39.147 --> 02:39.648
Book, Passion.

02:39.948 --> 02:42.311
Yeah, a book I've not read, I regret to say.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.613
I could mean to.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.735
It's on my long list of books to read.

02:45.795 --> 02:46.096
Anyway.

02:47.557 --> 02:49.860
Anyway, let's find a ways past it.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.461
I'll take care of that.

02:50.521 --> 02:50.821
Hello.

02:55.567 --> 02:58.371
So, this coffee's not half bad, actually.

02:58.471 --> 02:58.671
Good.

02:58.691 --> 02:58.791
Good.

02:59.311 --> 03:00.934
As coffee goes.

03:02.075 --> 03:02.877
No, collectors.

03:04.038 --> 03:06.062
Well, you don't want to talk about collectors now.

03:07.063 --> 03:08.045
No.

03:08.145 --> 03:13.093
But they are strange, fanatic people who by and large are not literary people, really.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.999
Their interest almost is never in the text itself.

03:17.890 --> 03:23.197
So when you attempt to discuss the text with them, they really have no sense of what's in the book.

03:23.277 --> 03:28.643
It's all they care about is the cover and the condition of the jacket and so on.

03:28.663 --> 03:31.187
This next book is not a book about collecting so much.

03:31.247 --> 03:37.214
I am interested in the book, however, as an artifact and also the text.

03:37.234 --> 03:47.627
A chapter I'm really involved in right now, of course, is this raging canon debate, and I wonder if you have any opinion on...

03:48.063 --> 04:08.576
I just, Scott Turow last week just told me in New York, I didn't interview Scott Turow in New York, and he said he was at a dinner at Amherst College when the president of the college was told that they had just graduated an English major, summa cum laude, and this, an English major who had never taken a course in Shakespeare.

04:09.838 --> 04:15.167
And he was, he said, we did that.

04:16.261 --> 04:17.824
Do you have any sense of this?

04:18.705 --> 04:25.276
You know, I don't teach, and you can imagine I would take a fairly conservative view of it.

04:26.177 --> 04:40.720
I was an English major, and we were given, at the outset of our careers there, this wonderful red book full of everything from Beowulf up to Virginia Woolf was the joke then, and between the two wolves.

04:42.904 --> 04:43.585
I think it was...

04:43.835 --> 04:45.597
you had to read some Shakespeare.

04:45.617 --> 04:56.091
You know, there were these, there was some room for play in it, but the idea of skipping Chaucer or Shakespeare or Milton.

04:56.572 --> 04:57.533
Spencer.

04:57.713 --> 04:58.234
Spencer.

04:58.354 --> 05:00.597
I loved Spencer, funnily enough, or imagine I did.

05:00.637 --> 05:12.413
I'm not sure I'd want to read him endlessly, but I certainly did read, too, The Fairy Queen, under the guidance of Douglas Bush, who was a Renaissance man, the man who specialized in the English Renaissance.

05:12.533 --> 05:12.593
Um,

05:13.585 --> 05:23.074
I think they're cheating themselves, really, in trying to adjust it to today's world, the mentality of the kids.

05:23.474 --> 05:36.447
Obviously, the canon has to alter, and certain things are going to drop out of it and welcome any new discoveries we have, especially black or female or both writers.

05:36.607 --> 05:40.150
But by and large, I'm afraid...

05:41.615 --> 05:56.058
I'm afraid the books in the canon are there for a reason, and they're not easily supplanted without degrading the meaning of an English major, being an English major.

05:56.078 --> 05:59.643
I had a very long interview in New Haven last month with Harold Bloom, of course.

05:59.663 --> 06:04.090
Yes, he's become a canonologist, a canonologist par excellence.

06:04.351 --> 06:08.938
And he believes that

06:09.712 --> 06:13.116
He says he's going to teach until he dies because he fears he's one of the last.

06:13.196 --> 06:28.253
You know, it's like when he's gone and people of his generation at his disposition, they're gone, that you won't have people teaching classical literature, classical English literature, whatever.

06:28.293 --> 06:32.918
And he foresees English departments as being two, three,

06:33.522 --> 06:40.028
teacher staffs, like the classics are taught now, like you study Latin or Greek.

06:40.068 --> 06:41.990
I mean, that's an unfortunate prospect.

06:42.230 --> 06:48.236
But I guess, of course, when you talk about the canon, what's going on now is that there are canons being developed.

06:48.837 --> 06:50.719
I mean, you have the feminist scholars.

06:50.779 --> 06:57.445
I mean, Sarah Orange-Jewitt has been beatified, and I think she's about to become a saint, you know, because it's been decided.

06:58.226 --> 07:00.188
And I wonder how valid these...

07:00.843 --> 07:29.702
selection processes I don't know it's just it is an interesting debate that I've ended and I cannot I never imagined how pitched a battle it was well there's nothing more fierce than these academic academic battles and you know we have lost canons obviously the entire classics canon is something that until not too many generations ago was considered the basis of humanistic education was

07:30.340 --> 07:35.245
to read the Greeks and the Romans, and we're pretty well dispensed with that, really.

07:36.086 --> 07:44.434
I had to pass a Latin requirement to get into Harvard in 1950, but that seems like kind of the last gasp of that particular.

07:44.494 --> 07:53.823
So things can get dropped that once seemed indispensable, but it is hard for me still to think of Shakespeare.

07:53.843 --> 07:58.828
I have read that Shakespeare, in about one more generation

07:59.534 --> 08:02.457
People just won't be able to understand him on the stage.

08:02.537 --> 08:11.245
That is, the language will have evolved far enough away from Elizabethan or Jacobian English that it would be impossible to show him as he was spoken.

08:11.345 --> 08:27.961
Well, I have always found that any time you plan to see a Shakespeare play in performance or even in a good film, it really does behoove you to read the play with all the notes and have a sense of the language because it's like an opera almost.

08:27.981 --> 08:28.461
Mm-hmm.

08:28.711 --> 08:37.946
the poetry is wonderful, and there are these wonderful arias and all that, but if you don't know the libretto, you're in tough shape.

08:38.026 --> 08:50.567
Apparently kids now are very resistant to 19th century novels, in which the language seems to me quite accessible and beautiful, but somebody like Hawthorne, whom I think of as

08:50.868 --> 08:58.717
a fairly lucid, clear writer, actually poses big vocabulary problems to them, and problems of diction, just the way he puts things.

08:58.837 --> 09:02.861
So this is the way maybe the great Victorians will fade away.

09:02.901 --> 09:11.150
They just can't be easily read without whatever notes and guidance and that other... I'm sorry.

09:11.551 --> 09:20.200
I gave a talk Saturday at the Concord Public Library, and on the way in they have, in a case, they have Emerson's...

09:20.855 --> 09:24.181
The presentation copy given to him by Thoreau Walden.

09:24.782 --> 09:26.666
I mean, I must say, I get a kick.

09:27.086 --> 09:32.997
And what made me think of that is I handled Hawthorne's own copy of Moby Dick given to him by Melville.

09:33.017 --> 09:35.682
That's in Philadelphia at the Rosenbach Museum.

09:35.702 --> 09:36.504
For heaven's sake.

09:36.524 --> 09:44.719
You talk about an artifact of giving you a really exciting... I mean, you think of the hands that something like this has passed through.

09:45.357 --> 09:47.659
I'm sorry to go off on this tangent here.

09:47.679 --> 09:49.241
No, no, it's a good tangent.

09:49.261 --> 09:50.642
We're both in the book business.

09:50.662 --> 09:52.064
I'm in the book business.

09:52.164 --> 09:53.926
I'm sorry, this will be used in my new book.

09:53.946 --> 09:57.649
I'm not some kind of a collector in a very small way of my own.

09:57.870 --> 10:05.758
I mean, I actually have shelled out fairly big amounts for first editions of The Wasteland.

10:05.778 --> 10:07.640
I seem to have a lot of Eliot for some reason.

10:07.700 --> 10:11.363
I mean, I've collected Eliot, because there's not that much of it.

10:11.684 --> 10:15.027
So I understand the joy of the book collector.

10:16.205 --> 10:20.312
It shouldn't take precedence over actually reading books.

10:20.332 --> 10:23.957
But you certainly have a sense of the book as an artifact, however.

10:23.997 --> 10:24.438
Yeah.

10:25.099 --> 10:26.321
And do you feel something?

10:26.361 --> 10:34.053
I mean, I just mentioned Hawthorne's copy of Moby Dick, where he is the dedicatee, by the way, which really makes it really special.

10:34.073 --> 10:36.337
That's a wonderful book to have in your hands.

10:36.618 --> 10:43.208
That's the one book that Rosenbach said he desperately had to have, and the one book he would never part with.

10:43.677 --> 10:50.187
He also purchased for $1,600 at auction in 1922 the manuscript of Ulysses.

10:50.727 --> 10:52.730
You know, John Quinn.

10:52.770 --> 10:53.572
What a steal.

10:53.772 --> 10:56.175
Total steal, and he knew it, too, at the time.

10:56.396 --> 10:57.317
It was cheap even then.

10:57.337 --> 10:58.739
It was thought to be even then.

10:58.899 --> 11:07.232
And Joyce was furious because he thought that was, you know, he for years tried to get it back.

11:07.252 --> 11:10.296
Yeah, he didn't think it would be properly cared for in the new world.

11:10.356 --> 11:11.999
That's right.

11:12.019 --> 11:12.840
Passing, but...

11:13.647 --> 11:20.497
One wonders just how many millions of dollars that would fetch at auctions today.

11:20.538 --> 11:26.266
Well, they better work fast, because pretty soon people won't be able to read Ulysses either, so it will become another dead book.

11:26.487 --> 11:29.491
Well, what they call them, you see, are dead white European males.

11:29.972 --> 11:32.816
I mean, that's dwems, is what they call them.

11:33.477 --> 11:40.448
And one other question, and then we'll leave it, but the argument put forth today, there was a big conference

11:40.664 --> 11:45.468
in Boston in August, the Association of Literary Critics.

11:45.508 --> 11:46.829
You've heard of this group.

11:46.889 --> 11:49.091
Roger Shattuck is the head of it.

11:50.192 --> 11:53.575
And it is trying to—it's in opposition to the MLA.

11:53.896 --> 11:54.236
I see.

11:54.256 --> 11:54.977
It's a counter.

11:54.997 --> 11:56.258
It's an anti-MLA.

11:56.318 --> 11:57.078
And it's interesting.

11:57.198 --> 11:57.799
I went there.

11:57.819 --> 12:01.622
It was a debate.

12:01.702 --> 12:08.448
I mean, the tenor of the—I mean, these are not meek little academics.

12:09.289 --> 12:10.350
And it was fascinating.

12:10.786 --> 12:18.457
But they were talking about, you know, that the argument is, put forth, a book text has to be relevant today.

12:18.477 --> 12:19.238
Do you agree with that?

12:19.779 --> 12:21.341
Does Shakespeare have to be relevant?

12:21.401 --> 12:22.302
Of course, he is relevant.

12:22.402 --> 12:23.884
It depends on how you find relevant.

12:23.904 --> 12:26.087
Of course, all the classics are relevant enough.

12:26.108 --> 12:29.552
They describe human nature, and that is very relevant.

12:29.592 --> 12:31.455
So it depends on how you define relevant.

12:31.515 --> 12:33.618
If you define it narrowly, of course.

12:33.838 --> 12:36.863
But then you get into books that are relevant in this sense now.

12:36.903 --> 12:38.765
They won't be relevant five years from now.

12:38.905 --> 12:40.708
You're just condemning yourself to it.

12:41.363 --> 12:44.306
I'll have the kids read newspapers.

12:44.727 --> 12:45.708
That's relevant, I guess.

12:47.610 --> 12:50.113
No, I don't believe in relevance in that way.

12:50.153 --> 12:54.598
I mean, I read things that are very remote from my own experience with a great pleasure and profit.

12:54.718 --> 12:55.819
Spencer, for example.

12:57.481 --> 13:08.333
You've got to get a sense of the stretch of human possibilities, and literature exists in part to give you other

13:08.887 --> 13:13.753
other lives, other ways of living, other contexts.

13:14.093 --> 13:20.121
And once you start paring it down to what really speaks to you, I think you're getting much narrower.

13:21.482 --> 13:28.912
And ultimately, you know, it tends to reinforce your own egotism, your own egoism, I should say.

13:30.133 --> 13:37.442
Whereas, no, I think it's great to pick up exotic, to have books be somewhat exotic as

13:38.182 --> 13:42.426
as I suppose the world of Paradise Lost is now to most people.

13:43.648 --> 13:49.794
But, no, anyway, Shattuck and others are pro-relevance or they're anti-relevance?

13:49.814 --> 13:51.556
No, they're pro-canon is what they are.

13:51.636 --> 14:00.865
Pro-canon, so they're anti-MLA and all of this, they think, excessively diverse and sensitive.

14:01.345 --> 14:03.868
Yeah, I don't know.

14:04.135 --> 14:07.600
diversity and sensitivity are sort of flash words here.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.241
Exactly.

14:08.321 --> 14:19.276
I was interested to see so many women at the conference, but not a single black face, notably conspicuous by their ancestors.

14:19.296 --> 14:23.703
One American-American in the whole hall.

14:23.743 --> 14:30.011
With gates across the river at Harvard, you know, you would have thought there might have been a, in that department, there might have been a presence.

14:30.072 --> 14:31.514
But anyway, I'm following it.

14:31.754 --> 14:33.957
I'm going to interview everybody that I can.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.030
and we'll see what develops out of it.

14:36.471 --> 14:49.629
You know, I have to tell you, baseball, of course, and this is where you're talking today on a Monday, two nights after the Yankees won the World Series, and you have written, I believe, one of the great, great, great baseball pieces.

14:50.210 --> 14:52.473
My only grace ball piece in a way.

14:52.493 --> 14:58.322
Well, it's like if you only had one time at bat, you may as well hit it out of the park, you know.

14:59.704 --> 15:01.446
Golf doesn't seem to...

15:02.320 --> 15:10.894
I would say prior to this book doesn't seem to conjure up the kind of beauty that you would expect from a writer.

15:10.914 --> 15:17.484
I wonder, was this a challenge for you as a writer of wonderful fiction and stories?

15:18.386 --> 15:23.374
The world of golf, when I entered it at the age of 25, was magical to me.

15:23.494 --> 15:28.682
As I say in there, I had read about it, I'd read the Woodhouse stories, uh,

15:29.658 --> 15:36.006
It is mentioned in English novels, I mean, the golf course, the murder mysteries, I forget what else.

15:36.026 --> 15:42.515
I had some reading acquaintance with golf, but none of the actual practice of it.

15:42.775 --> 15:55.952
And the simplicity and difficulty of the swing and the variety, all that loomed to me as exciting, mystical even, mystical.

15:56.202 --> 15:57.243
I wanted to write about it.

15:57.404 --> 16:00.167
I mean, it became something that interested me.

16:00.948 --> 16:08.638
It's very hard for a writer to write about what doesn't interest him, although you're often being invited to write about things that interest other people.

16:08.738 --> 16:11.842
But you're stuck with your own psyche.

16:12.582 --> 16:14.465
The first attempts were in fiction.

16:14.545 --> 16:15.366
I described it.

16:15.947 --> 16:22.615
I read a lot of books of instruction.

16:23.017 --> 16:31.213
The book wouldn't exist probably if Golf Digest hadn't invited me to write more or less an annual little essay on golf.

16:31.233 --> 16:35.602
And most of the really new material in there are those essays.

16:35.902 --> 16:43.557
I find it very easy to write about, unlike team sports where so much depends upon...

16:44.347 --> 17:14.151
lightning fast interaction you know golf is sort of out there it's very transparent in that it shares that with baseball you can sort of see what's happening right there's no hidden thing in the line no subtleties that belong only to the participants so in that way it lends itself to being written about and I did have this urgent this urgent sense of being thrilled by the experience of playing golf

17:14.536 --> 17:16.459
You can have a dismal round, of course.

17:16.539 --> 17:19.645
You can wonder why you're wasting your time.

17:20.847 --> 17:27.418
You can reach, and I sort of mention this in the book, too, you can reach the point where you realize you're not going to get much better.

17:27.458 --> 17:33.649
Despite all that, there remains a great charm for me.

17:33.809 --> 17:34.350
It's a...

17:35.157 --> 17:38.382
I was funny as a kid.

17:38.482 --> 17:45.573
You have either wimps who can't do sports at all, or you have the jocks who can do them all very nicely.

17:46.454 --> 17:48.357
And I was really somewhere between.

17:48.377 --> 17:57.430
I wasn't very good, but I did like athletic endeavors, and I played a lot of sort of alley basketball, a lot of vacant lot touch football, a lot of vacant lot baseball.

17:57.971 --> 18:01.857
So the sensations of all these sports were real to me, even though I

18:02.208 --> 18:03.550
never rescinded the heights.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.872
It wasn't what my father used to call a natural.

18:06.533 --> 18:11.599
He was a public school teacher, and so he would—he was kind of a fatalist about performance.

18:11.659 --> 18:20.350
It was interesting, both as students, you know, brains, you either had it or you didn't, and the same thing went for athletic ability—you either had it or you didn't.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.312
Another Calvinist, maybe, point of view.

18:23.313 --> 18:26.697
But I'm afraid that overall it kind of holds up.

18:27.385 --> 18:43.200
But so that for me to have some sport I can do as an adult and, you know, not lose all the time, win some of the time, and be better than some people, if worse than others, all that is kind of meaningful to me.

18:44.241 --> 18:47.724
It's kept me in touch with my physical self in a way.

18:48.065 --> 18:49.146
I did play tennis also.

18:49.446 --> 18:53.730
My first wife and I had even built a tennis court, so...

18:54.048 --> 19:01.462
But that kind of went with my first marriage, and tennis never struck me as quite as magical, really, as golf.

19:02.384 --> 19:03.305
Interesting.

19:03.325 --> 19:08.254
Of course, there's that very early quote from your wife, I mean, the dreams.

19:08.996 --> 19:11.561
That's where you actually derived your title, I think.

19:12.442 --> 19:16.630
She dreams, she's always winning, and it's wonderful.

19:17.251 --> 19:23.083
Well, it is true that like sex, if you go without it for a while, you begin to dream about it.

19:23.143 --> 19:26.029
And that's been the case with me in golf.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.394
In the winter, you get this golf hunger.

19:28.694 --> 19:29.656
It's strange.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.582
And it begins to enter your dreams.

19:32.963 --> 19:37.572
And I think the major point I made in that is that...

19:37.940 --> 19:43.609
You always accept the course in a golf dream, however outrageously difficult it is.

19:43.670 --> 19:54.688
You know, you're hitting off of a table or trying to get the ball into a thimble or whatever the preposterous condition is, you always doggedly accept it as the way you do on a golf course, really.

19:54.708 --> 19:58.835
It's just another kind of golf course that you're being condemned to play on.

19:59.055 --> 20:03.643
It is interesting also that we talk about the comparison that baseball and golf...

20:04.282 --> 20:20.264
and I think you've already suggested, you know, baseball is a game, let's face it, certainly at our age, where you enjoy it as an observer, and you watch these wonderfully gifted young men play brilliantly and perform, but we observe it from here.

20:21.025 --> 20:33.462
Golf, on the other hand, is a participatory sport, and I guess there is a fundamental difference there, certainly from the perspective of a writer who's writing about it.

20:34.049 --> 20:35.030
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:35.050 --> 20:48.304
It'd be very hard for me to endlessly identify the way, say, Roger Angel does, to get endlessly excited about these athletes as they rise and fall and come and go and the waves of them.

20:49.045 --> 20:52.648
You mentioned the Williams piece, but I had been a Williams fan.

20:52.749 --> 20:58.234
I picked him out of the world of baseball from Pennsylvania.

20:58.254 --> 21:01.778
I'd been struck by this star up there in Boston.

21:02.568 --> 21:12.942
I really kind of fell in love with him in the way of a pre-adolescent does with these remote figures, and I followed his career.

21:13.022 --> 21:21.213
So when I sat down to write about that last game, I had 15 years of Williams' adoration under my belt, and I knew basically the career.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.656
I couldn't do that with everybody.

21:23.696 --> 21:30.465
I mean, unlike a sports writer, I just couldn't work up that degree of passion for another...

21:31.171 --> 21:32.072
another player.

21:32.092 --> 21:43.310
I follow baseball somewhat, and sorry to see the Red Sox have such a mediocre season, but certainly the Williams, I was crazy.

21:43.330 --> 21:50.000
I mean, I used to listen to the radio, car radio, until I wore out the car radio and the battery wouldn't turn over.

21:50.721 --> 21:54.667
That's how keen I was on following Ted Williams.

21:55.709 --> 21:58.393
Kind of madness, and like other sorts of madness, it

21:59.032 --> 22:03.396
how it belongs to a certain season in your life, and you're not going to sustain it to the end.

22:04.438 --> 22:11.405
Well, there is a similar kind of a madness than the golf passion, don't you think, in a way?

22:11.785 --> 22:13.787
Yes, yes, and I thought I was over it.

22:13.867 --> 22:17.110
As I said when I wrote the introduction, this is sort of it for me in golf.

22:17.171 --> 22:22.516
I'm going to bind these up, and I hate the game now, and I'm lousy at it.

22:22.816 --> 22:26.440
Well, that's why you hated it, because you weren't

22:27.685 --> 22:42.424
And the structure of the book, I have to say, one of the critics, I really agree, and I think it's actually been the case with all of your books, apart from the novels, of course, is that there is a mindful structure here.

22:42.645 --> 22:44.948
This isn't just a gathering of your pieces.

22:45.288 --> 22:52.177
I think that you really exercised a considerable amount of thought here in arranging these stories.

22:52.197 --> 22:54.520
And maybe you could talk a little bit about the

22:54.736 --> 22:57.580
what you had in mind there as a literary structure?

22:57.600 --> 23:04.611
Well, the idea of making it, learning the game, playing the game, loving the game, that came to me.

23:04.631 --> 23:24.220
I did have this morass of golf pieces, some old, some new, and various textures, even a few pawns, and needing some kind of organizing principle, and those three heads occurred to me as a good way to do it, and...

23:25.364 --> 23:44.206
first you show the difficulty of the game and all this ridiculous instruction that you must submit to, and then the fiction basically showing what it feels like to be playing, and then winding up with these little homages that one gets asked to write.

23:44.286 --> 23:46.228
I've become known now as a golf writer.

23:46.268 --> 23:50.713
You know, I get mail, John Updike, golf writer, and I'm kept apprised of all of the

23:51.402 --> 23:59.071
the course statistics on every tournament that's played in the PGA circuit now, so on the strength of just that.

23:59.391 --> 24:00.452
Do you read this stuff?

24:00.472 --> 24:00.712
No.

24:01.033 --> 24:01.593
No, I don't.

24:02.214 --> 24:03.415
I can't say that I do.

24:03.476 --> 24:04.677
I'm not going to write about it.

24:04.757 --> 24:09.122
I do watch often the weekend tournaments when they're on.

24:09.182 --> 24:13.106
Now they're pretty well crowded off by football.

24:13.186 --> 24:19.013
But I follow it as a sport to a minor degree.

24:19.246 --> 24:22.672
It's a way of loving the game, isn't it?

24:23.073 --> 24:26.660
You can't play it all the time, but you can watch other people play it.

24:26.720 --> 24:34.414
Of a January day, it's pretty nice to watch those desert courses and see it all start up again.

24:34.434 --> 24:37.760
And now we have a new star.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.203
Isn't he wonderful?

24:39.483 --> 24:41.507
Well, he does seem to be wonderful, really.

24:41.757 --> 24:43.640
Yeah, no, he has been amazing.

24:43.660 --> 24:46.544
He's too good to be true, even.

24:46.564 --> 24:50.329
I'm sorry to impose my thoughts on this, but he's wonderful.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.030
He really is.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.153
He's such a gentleman, such a nice young man.

24:53.193 --> 25:01.164
He's a very poised young man with an awful lot of expectation on his shoulders, but he seems to be sort of savvy enough.

25:01.844 --> 25:06.651
Indeed, not just Tiger Woods, but all of these kids...

25:07.458 --> 25:13.907
like Mickelson and Niklaus in his day, come up having won a lot of... They've won a lot of golf already.

25:13.987 --> 25:14.788
We haven't seen it.

25:14.868 --> 25:17.292
It's been sort of lower-level golf.

25:17.532 --> 25:22.980
But they should... You know, they're kind of accustomed to the sensations of the spotlight a little more than we may be.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.902
But there's also an expectation there, too.

25:25.283 --> 25:25.643
Heavy.

25:26.445 --> 25:33.535
But look at all these guys that have won the Heisman Trophy in football, and they go into the NFL, and you never hear from them again.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.596
I mean, they disappear...

25:35.015 --> 25:40.101
In this instance, Tiger, the expect, he's already surpassed the expectations.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.363
I mean, he's way ahead of everybody.

25:41.403 --> 25:45.207
Nobody thought he would win two out of whatever, five tournaments.

25:45.227 --> 25:47.991
He just wanted to make enough to get his ticket for the next tour.

25:48.151 --> 25:50.133
I mean, he's done that in space.

25:50.193 --> 25:52.296
No, it was an amazing debut.

25:52.736 --> 25:55.640
Probably it hasn't never been anything quite like it.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.663
The question now, I guess, is how will he hold up?

25:59.224 --> 26:01.627
A number of opinions.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.110
A number of the older players have said that he's going to,

26:04.360 --> 26:07.564
Achilles' back, the way you swing, sing for too long.

26:08.585 --> 26:18.976
I guess Dr. Carrie Middlecoff, the dentist, delivered that verdict, and Trevino said that he has to learn not to hit it so hard.

26:19.597 --> 26:24.202
But what makes him glamorous is the length, isn't it?

26:24.222 --> 26:27.846
We seem to like length in golf.

26:28.086 --> 26:32.511
All sorts of extremes, I guess.

26:34.229 --> 26:47.067
When you're out there playing golf, and you mentioned earlier that you, with such a passion, for such a pastime, that as a writer you knew that you had to embrace it in some fashion or another into your, into your art.

26:47.708 --> 26:51.553
But when you're out there, that's, you're not thinking about anything like that at all, are you?

26:51.573 --> 26:52.535
I mean, you're not thinking about you.

26:52.555 --> 26:57.462
This would be a pretty good detail, a novel or a story, or I can write a piece about this.

26:57.542 --> 26:59.224
Or are you?

26:59.339 --> 27:05.189
I'm trying to think of an instance where I self-consciously noted something, and I don't believe there was anything.

27:05.230 --> 27:22.821
They really seem kind of different activities, and one of the reasons I play golf is it gets me away from writing and literary politics and the rather claustrophobic little world of the printed page, so you tend not to think literary thoughts.

27:23.081 --> 27:23.963
When I...

27:25.141 --> 27:31.590
I've gone on about four trips to both Scotland and Ireland.

27:32.632 --> 27:40.203
Seeing those courses for the first time, and you realize what golf is really meant to be.

27:40.223 --> 27:48.215
I may have had a literary thought or two in there, because those are beautiful courses.

27:48.235 --> 27:50.338
I mean, they're beautiful in that they...

27:51.365 --> 27:54.833
restore you to the essence of the game.

27:54.893 --> 28:01.026
You don't get tired, for example, playing golf in the British Isles the way you do in the States.

28:01.106 --> 28:06.017
Somehow you can walk 36 holes on that turf and not really feel it.

28:06.418 --> 28:10.707
And the courses don't seem to have been constructed, but just

28:11.041 --> 28:39.715
holes have been laid out on this pre-existing terrain and I'm sure that's not exactly true those courses have been shaped also but they seem unshaped so in a funny way it does restore you and I don't think any too many other sports have this kind of Vatican feeling this more than Vatican it's like the source this sort of magical source of the game that still exists uh

28:40.252 --> 28:45.098
You don't get that feeling about volleyball when you go out to where volleyball was invented, for instance.

28:45.138 --> 28:45.778
Springfield.

28:45.839 --> 28:48.201
Springfield, right.

28:49.182 --> 28:51.826
Hopefully hard to get excited about volleyball, you're going to say.

28:51.846 --> 28:57.833
I don't know, even that, you know, volleyball, we used to play it in our young married days.

28:57.853 --> 29:01.257
I love volleyball, yeah.

29:01.277 --> 29:08.385
And it's capable of, you know, you can show off at volleyball and you can dub up at volleyball, but...

29:08.737 --> 29:09.838
You're right.

29:09.858 --> 29:12.001
It's not one of the great sports.

29:12.021 --> 29:14.064
I've got a 15-year-old daughter who swims.

29:15.205 --> 29:16.467
Thank you again for coming in.

29:16.847 --> 29:17.688
Thank you.

29:17.708 --> 29:19.531
Thank you for making the space available.

29:20.091 --> 29:20.792
Thanks very much.

29:20.872 --> 29:21.573
Nice to see you.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.416
Take care.

29:23.436 --> 29:24.076
You too.

29:25.678 --> 29:27.401
Is golf a metaphor for you?

29:29.143 --> 29:35.571
Well, it's a kind of a, yeah,

29:36.074 --> 29:37.476
Let's say it is a metaphor.

29:37.536 --> 29:40.560
It teaches you about life or teaches you about yourself.

29:43.624 --> 29:49.351
It's unlike life in that you get this very rapid feedback of how well you're doing.

29:49.892 --> 29:53.477
Most life you don't know how well you're doing and so you're able to kid yourself.

29:54.038 --> 29:57.002
Golf doesn't let you kid yourself.

29:58.944 --> 30:05.693
And in also a way it's a lot of what life is not now.

30:06.044 --> 30:11.450
In a crowded world here in the crowded Northeast, it is space.

30:12.431 --> 30:23.082
One of the reasons it makes it so expensive is it does offer you space, kind of a return to a hunter self.

30:23.502 --> 30:30.710
You know, you get this kind of a harmony with the land that you feel as you walk those 18 holes.

30:31.691 --> 30:34.954
You don't feel in too many other places anymore.

30:35.947 --> 30:51.407
Golf and cemeteries are about the last places that, and when you fly, when you fly over Northeast America, as we all do, you look down and you see the golf courses, how distinguishing they are, how easily they are.

30:51.847 --> 30:52.468
You spot them.

30:52.688 --> 30:54.070
I always try to figure out the layout.

30:54.130 --> 31:01.279
I'm looking down on the golf course, and you're flying over it, and try even to see if anybody's playing it.

31:01.968 --> 31:04.050
Could you finish that sentence?

31:04.751 --> 31:06.012
Of course it's in cemeteries.

31:06.233 --> 31:07.874
Oh, of course it's in cemeteries.

31:07.934 --> 31:14.041
We've got the last places that are holding open land for us, that are a green space that's being used.

31:14.061 --> 31:29.578
Instead of arbitrarily and artificially declaring something a park, here you have a kind of utility that also has the advantage of keeping open the green space and a certain

31:29.879 --> 31:34.104
antiquity to them both, isn't there?

31:34.225 --> 31:36.167
Golf courses don't change very much.

31:36.588 --> 31:43.777
This is the way the course looked when Bobby Jones strolled it in 1921, and the cemeteries don't change too much either.

31:43.797 --> 31:56.173
So it's a place, kind of a place where the past still lives in a nice way.

31:56.508 --> 31:59.513
Wander when you have the opportunity through old cemeteries.

31:59.553 --> 32:00.114
That's interesting.

32:00.134 --> 32:01.797
I was just in Concord the other day.

32:01.837 --> 32:05.883
I have a wonderful old cemetery right there as I was going on to the library.

32:07.225 --> 32:08.407
You did bring up a cemetery.

32:08.888 --> 32:09.649
Yeah.

32:09.669 --> 32:18.383
Well, the one in Concord contains the sacred remains of Emerson and Hawthorne and Thoreau, right?

32:18.403 --> 32:19.185
All in a bunch.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.727
It's amazing, isn't it?

32:21.044 --> 32:21.545
It is.

32:21.705 --> 32:23.289
And they gave your books to the library.

32:24.571 --> 32:28.840
For a small-town library, it's probably the nicest small-town library I've ever seen.

32:28.860 --> 32:29.642
It's a conquered one.

32:30.183 --> 32:31.525
It's a very elegant little town.

32:32.307 --> 32:36.235
Not cheap to live there either, but it is very pretty.

32:36.704 --> 32:39.328
for a desirable place, as I guess it was in Emerson's Day.

32:39.448 --> 32:43.114
Even in Emerson's Day, it was a kind of a tony, a tony place.

32:43.134 --> 32:49.465
And also, when people think about Thoreau going off to the lake, you know, to live in the wilderness, I mean, he could walk home for dinner.

32:49.505 --> 32:50.226
That's right.

32:50.787 --> 32:51.348
That's right.

32:51.368 --> 32:53.511
I know, and sometimes did.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.796
And he had a lot of visitors.

32:56.877 --> 33:00.282
Well, he mentions some of

33:00.802 --> 33:08.332
I guess even in the book there's a chapter on visitors, but he wasn't near as isolated as you say.

33:08.372 --> 33:16.884
I interviewed the fellow who wrote the biography of him some years ago, and we walked, we did it out there, and it was kind of one of these in-situ things.

33:17.425 --> 33:21.430
He said, well, here it was, oh, here was the cabin, it was over here, it's not there any longer.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.913
I said, we really had very far from anything.

33:23.953 --> 33:28.800
He said, no, that's one of the great legends about this whole thing, you know.

33:29.185 --> 33:31.388
But, of course, it was wonderful.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.534
I'm not going to take up too much of your concern.

33:35.554 --> 33:38.558
The book does speak quite eloquently for itself.

33:39.098 --> 33:42.523
I find it really unnecessary to ask you things.

33:43.344 --> 33:47.410
You asked me about cemeteries, though, and whether I spend much time in them.

33:47.890 --> 33:49.833
I guess the answer is yes.

33:50.534 --> 33:53.939
My wife has gotten very interested in genealogy.

33:54.519 --> 33:56.442
We've taken a number of excursions.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.947
trying to find the graves of her ancestors.

34:00.007 --> 34:03.511
They're mostly in Connecticut and New York State.

34:03.591 --> 34:11.160
New York State was kind of a frontier, you know, and the records are far from clear.

34:11.220 --> 34:16.646
Everything's pretty clear in New England because the little church ran things in a tidy way.

34:16.686 --> 34:20.490
So you can trace your ancestors in Massachusetts all right and in Connecticut.

34:20.510 --> 34:22.473
But you get into New York State and it's wild.

34:22.513 --> 34:27.238
So anyway, you go there and you trudge around in these cemeteries looking for

34:27.877 --> 34:28.899
for the right names.

34:29.419 --> 34:39.996
Sometimes you find them, but they're very, some of them are very lovely, some are very run down, some are hideously overgrown, where trees are actually taking over and throwing the stones around.

34:40.016 --> 34:45.545
It's sort of a ghastly sight to see a cemetery that's truly neglected and going back to forest.

34:47.127 --> 34:53.257
Yeah, they're pleasant places and redolent of the past, but you know there is a past.

34:53.377 --> 34:55.420
I think that's one of the problems with the modern

34:55.703 --> 35:06.939
1996 is that there's so little to really create respect for the past or make real all the lives that have preceded ours.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.943
Everything just happened yesterday and here it is.

35:10.724 --> 35:11.825
Zip, zip and everything.

35:12.006 --> 35:15.591
Are there ever any epiphanous moments out there as there are in the golf course?

35:16.532 --> 35:18.475
No, because you're not doing anything, are you?

35:18.515 --> 35:24.563
I guess the highest bliss is that I find this stone that you've been looking for and there the person sleeps

35:25.184 --> 35:27.646
and has been sort of waiting for you.

35:27.827 --> 35:36.596
A couple times we actually, even finding these old country cemeteries isn't easy because they were pretty small, and now it's on somebody else's land you trudge in.

35:36.716 --> 35:44.604
But no, you're not interacting the way you are on golf course.

35:44.624 --> 35:45.925
It's all about interaction.

35:46.466 --> 35:50.730
And interaction in golf is purely basic elements, right?

35:50.750 --> 35:52.812
You're interacting with the space of it.

35:53.534 --> 35:57.139
the contours of the land, especially when you get to putt.

35:57.159 --> 36:01.886
It makes you think about all the things that modern man has more or less stopped thinking about.

36:03.168 --> 36:03.889
That's wonderful.

36:04.450 --> 36:05.271
Any thoughts?

36:05.331 --> 36:15.085
I've never asked a man about works in progress with regard to fiction, but I've brought along, of course, what I think is one of the great books of my lifetime.

36:15.125 --> 36:15.485
Oh, really?

36:15.505 --> 36:20.993
Anyone who reads professionally,

36:21.817 --> 36:39.564
Do you at any point see creating a new character, one of these resonant characters that you like, such as Rapidor, even as Beck, that will be able to trace your passage?

36:39.844 --> 36:40.325
It's nice.

36:40.625 --> 36:47.876
People like it, don't they, when they have the continuous characters and the world that kind of fills in and goes on.

36:48.257 --> 36:49.579
And I know I kind of...

36:50.251 --> 36:58.662
I stumbled on this by reviving Rabbit when I couldn't think of anything better to do in Rabbit Redux.

36:58.782 --> 37:04.149
I didn't really write Rabbit Run with any sort of a sequel.

37:04.189 --> 37:16.444
But once I did that and realized how good it felt and how nice to have the characters already named and the town already characterized, everything is set up for you.

37:17.015 --> 37:20.680
So it's a way, kind of a blisp, a blisp of the writer.

37:21.742 --> 37:39.487
And, yeah, it's sort of scary now as I approach the time when I would be beginning yet another rabbit novel to realize that I've pretty well, I've repeatedly said in interviews I won't write another one and I set up the last one to really preclude any sequel.

37:40.408 --> 37:46.397
Still, I feel badly, you mentioned Beck, and I've not closed him, and I would like to

37:47.609 --> 38:06.255
He was a vehicle for writerly experiences, which I was having at the time, and I created a guy who was in some superficial, maybe not superficial, some basics, unlike me, and he came to life for me.

38:07.797 --> 38:15.388
I tried to begin another Beck story some years ago, and somehow I got lost in it.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.578
But I would like to write a third Beck book.

38:18.658 --> 38:23.307
I have one story already written and then published called Beck in Check.

38:24.129 --> 38:38.136
He's older than I. That whole kind of scene, that literary Jewish-American, basically New York literary scene that he inhabited and kind of poked fun of,

38:38.993 --> 38:40.675
I'm not sure it still exists.

38:40.916 --> 38:43.640
Or if it does exist, I'm too much out of touch with it.

38:43.660 --> 38:44.861
I don't know.

38:44.881 --> 38:48.807
I've been out in New England for too long, maybe, to write any more about Henry Beck.

38:49.488 --> 38:51.110
But I loved those stories.

38:51.210 --> 38:53.634
I thought, really, they were among my crispest.

38:53.654 --> 38:57.219
And also, he was a character, unlike Rabbit, who was articulate.

38:57.299 --> 39:05.170
And there was no thought you could have that you couldn't assign to him, because he was a subtle-thinking intellectual.

39:06.162 --> 39:35.038
in a way that no it's true he was a good character and offered himself as a receptacle and that's what you want in a character is you want somebody who's enough unlike you that you're it's fun to be imagine yourself in his skin or her skin but also somebody that you you know to which you can feel a simpatico and feel some identification that's the magic word identification

39:35.474 --> 40:05.447
so anyway Beck had that yeah I might I'm 64 I can't see myself inventing another rabbit though I mean inventing another character who I will carry forward I think every novel I write now is kind of my last word on that particular topic Couples is a book that could have had a sequel at some point but maybe not it pretty well wraps up those particular people and in a way that

40:06.676 --> 40:15.826
Witches of Eastwick was a sequel to couples of the people who all have different names, but it's that particular situation, following the women under their divorced condition.

40:17.928 --> 40:20.952
But again, a small town with a kind of seethe in it.

40:20.972 --> 40:22.153
I love that one.

40:22.173 --> 40:25.977
Small town, seethe, the way everybody knows everything.

40:26.017 --> 40:33.105
I think that opening chapter, if I were to be teaching a course to really illustrate exposition, how to set a scene,

40:33.929 --> 40:43.382
that would be the opening chapter, which is basically just brilliant how we absolutely set that scene and where we are and the clouds.

40:45.084 --> 40:46.406
It was really wonderful.

40:46.706 --> 40:58.381
I was reading a certain amount of Hawthorne, I think, and so that sort of New England sinister something that he captures was in my mind.

40:58.942 --> 41:03.328
Yeah, it's nice to write about that kind of reverberating environment

41:03.528 --> 41:10.923
Unlike, say, New York City, which is so vast that everything opens out in a disorienting way.

41:11.003 --> 41:16.875
In a small town, everything reflects back, and the people keep meeting each other in different ways.

41:17.016 --> 41:22.026
So there's a nice net you can get going in.

41:22.411 --> 41:27.999
Yeah, that's the only book of mine that made Harold Bloom's canon, by the way, is Witches of Eastwick.

41:28.179 --> 41:30.202
Philip Watt did well, but they're very good friends.

41:30.222 --> 41:32.585
Oh boy, he did very well, didn't he?

41:32.605 --> 41:33.346
You noticed that?

41:34.187 --> 41:35.108
I asked him about it.

41:35.128 --> 41:36.971
You know, they're very good friends, you know.

41:37.311 --> 41:37.932
Nepotism.

41:38.793 --> 41:43.860
He insists that friendship has nothing to do with it.

41:43.880 --> 41:44.882
This thing has run down.

41:44.922 --> 41:45.803
Do you care?

41:46.323 --> 41:47.305
No, it's not.

41:47.325 --> 41:47.765
It's running?

41:47.865 --> 41:49.388
All right, good.

41:49.468 --> 41:50.690
We'll get an hour on each side.

41:50.710 --> 41:53.074
It's such a tiny little... It's wonderful.

41:53.434 --> 41:54.015
It really is.

41:54.516 --> 41:57.060
I've never seen one quite so small and refined.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.542
And it's good.

41:58.643 --> 41:59.244
It's reliable.

41:59.304 --> 42:02.769
I've had them smaller, but they break down.

42:04.131 --> 42:05.273
Plus, the fidelity is good.

42:05.293 --> 42:12.685
I transcribe it home on a... If I were to play it here, it wouldn't sound so great, but you take the tape and put it into a...

42:12.935 --> 42:16.440
It's a pericorder made in this country?

42:16.540 --> 42:21.626
It's an Olympus, but it's their pearl quarter.

42:25.391 --> 42:26.533
I've got plenty of stuff, sir.

42:26.613 --> 42:32.781
I wonder, would you do me the honor of inscribing it?

42:32.801 --> 42:33.582
Sure.

42:33.602 --> 42:35.084
Well, this is interesting.

42:35.104 --> 42:40.191
Speaking of documents, when I was writing about Buchanan A.,

42:41.403 --> 42:48.431
He was, of course, the president before Lincoln, and he had to handle the secession of many of the Southern states.

42:49.753 --> 43:03.188
He was pro-Southern, and so they weren't going to secede if he had won again or if somebody else had, but because Lincoln anyway, Buchanan was an old guy, kind of doddery, and where he was unmistakably pro-Southern.

43:03.228 --> 43:05.751
He owed his political life to the South.

43:06.092 --> 43:08.895
Nevertheless, he balked at letting them

43:09.230 --> 43:14.936
go free, just saying, that's fine, secede, even though there was nothing in the Constitution about secession.

43:16.178 --> 43:31.254
A fellow Pennsylvanian in his cabinet kind of brought him around to taking a firmer stand, a man called Black, and rewrote a speech Buchanan was going to give.

43:31.274 --> 43:36.520
I'm really a little hazy on the details, but this all happened at about December

43:37.073 --> 43:41.918
just on a few months before Lincoln took over and the Civil War began.

43:43.880 --> 43:53.590
Black, having tossed sleeplessly all night, worried about the rightness of Buchanan's rather conciliatory address.

43:53.610 --> 43:56.513
They were negotiating with the South Carolina commissioners, I guess.

43:57.034 --> 44:05.663
Anyway, he wrote out a revised, tougher version that really changed the course of the administration for its few remaining months.

44:06.385 --> 44:09.288
And they're very important in the story of Buchanan, if you care.

44:09.368 --> 44:11.531
Anyway, I held them in the University of Pennsylvania.

44:12.251 --> 44:20.080
They had these things, and here are all these sheets of paper covered with this wonderful, confident, flowing 19th-century hand of black.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.566
And for a moment, at least, these were the most important pieces of paper in the United States.

44:26.547 --> 44:29.269
History flowed through them and then flowed on.

44:29.710 --> 44:31.212
But you do feel it, yeah.

44:31.612 --> 44:34.435
Stephen Jay Gould, who I've interviewed for this book,

44:35.005 --> 44:39.710
He maintains that he has to hold the original stuff.

44:39.830 --> 44:44.675
He can't get the same thing from facsimiles.

44:45.956 --> 44:46.797
You find that.

44:46.817 --> 44:47.657
I don't know.

44:48.238 --> 44:49.019
There have been studies.

44:49.039 --> 44:50.740
They did a replica of the spirit of St.

44:50.781 --> 44:50.941
Louis.

44:50.961 --> 44:51.802
It looked just like it.

44:51.842 --> 44:53.984
Nobody was interested in having that picture taken.

44:54.004 --> 44:54.945
No, it's the magic.

44:55.025 --> 45:01.311
It's just those little cells that rubbed off from the hands of Lindbergh's hands.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.432
Oh, you're right.

45:02.452 --> 45:03.493
Replicas don't do it.

45:04.638 --> 45:17.451
And a library like Widener at Harvard used to have an astounding number of pre-1800 books on its open shelves, and you could check them in and out.

45:17.571 --> 45:22.616
And, of course, people stole them as if it went up in value, and now I guess they're more restricted.

45:22.777 --> 45:30.004
But it was amazing what you could find in Widener in terms of— Well, what I learned Saturday at the Concord Free Public Library?

45:30.541 --> 45:36.211
As recently as 1955, Bolo's own annotated books were in general circulation.

45:36.251 --> 45:36.772
Oh, really?

45:39.317 --> 45:44.646
You could go up and take out the book with his annotations in the margins.

45:44.666 --> 45:46.189
That's amazing, isn't it?

45:46.209 --> 45:49.615
I mean, it's within very recent times that they've taken them out of circulation.

45:50.577 --> 45:52.220
And there were a few things lost.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.165
But, thankfully, Conker's a pretty proper town.

45:55.685 --> 46:14.942
I remember I asked the woman, I said, well, you said the world is... The world of books is sufficiently vast so that it does form, as Borges has pointed out, it can form an alternative universe and people can vanish into it, you know, and real reality, three-dimensional reality becomes secondary and kind of negligible.

46:15.123 --> 46:18.469
So there's a danger of a certain kind of book...

46:19.242 --> 46:44.862
book madness there's a younger writer called nicholson baker i don't know if you know his stuff berkeley raging against i try to raging against the dumping the dumping of old books and they switch over to yeah no you should he's in england now and he feels very passionately and he's you know blundered into a kind of a hornet's nest because these librarians are very defensive and

46:45.702 --> 46:55.737
of their new electronic turf, and don't want to hear about how they're dumping all these somewhat, you know, possibly precious old volumes.

46:57.019 --> 47:01.226
The books on the one hand are trash, on the other hand they're prices.

47:01.266 --> 47:03.930
But he's an example of a writer who almost is

47:04.822 --> 47:12.372
scarily into the world of print, and his writing is kind of now about print.

47:12.392 --> 47:17.078
He wrote a very long essay about the word lumber, in the sense of metal lumber.

47:18.359 --> 47:18.960
Yeah, right.

47:18.980 --> 47:22.344
You've read the title piece, and it goes on and on.

47:22.424 --> 47:31.496
For me, it's had its fascination, but I recognize it as a... It takes you back to... Who's the guy who wrote The Anatomy of Melancholy?

47:31.536 --> 47:32.297
A

47:32.682 --> 47:33.683
Burton, wasn't that?

47:33.804 --> 47:41.034
Those kind of Renaissance text, totally text-absorbed people.

47:41.415 --> 47:49.046
Well, I was just out in the Bay Area a month ago, and I interviewed the new director of the Stanford Public Library.

47:49.066 --> 47:51.129
Yeah, his name is like Dowlin or something.

47:51.149 --> 47:53.533
Well, that's Ken Dowlin of the San Francisco Public Library.

47:53.573 --> 47:55.316
Mike Keller is the guy down at Stanford.

47:55.336 --> 47:56.277
I see, all right.

47:56.746 --> 47:59.589
And of course, he's the most wired, I mean, everything.

47:59.609 --> 48:03.934
Stanford University Press is actually publishing books now, not on paper.

48:03.954 --> 48:04.395
Really?

48:04.455 --> 48:08.159
I mean, but with scientific journals, it makes some sense, you know.

48:08.259 --> 48:24.357
If something's going to be a monograph and only be issued in 600 volumes, and it's going to cost $200, and it's going to be obsolete the day it comes out anyway, if it's about, you know, tissues and cells and stuff like that, maybe it makes sense for that kind of stuff to be online that you access.

48:24.978 --> 48:29.484
But I asked him about Nicholson Baker, and he said, that pornographer.

48:29.825 --> 48:30.406
Really?

48:31.107 --> 48:33.590
He called him a pornographer.

48:33.750 --> 48:41.421
I'm talking about the reaction to this, how much sleep he's caused until who's, you know, with his sniping.

48:42.342 --> 48:45.827
He had a piece in the New Yorker just two weeks ago about the cards.

48:45.887 --> 48:46.588
Did you see that?

48:46.648 --> 48:47.009
I read it.

48:47.129 --> 48:48.090
The October 14th.

48:48.130 --> 48:53.618
Well, about his fight with the library of San Francisco and so on, and

48:53.952 --> 48:55.514
I think he was shaken, really.

48:55.534 --> 48:59.619
He's not a shy guy who's not used to this sort of public dispute.

49:00.840 --> 49:06.667
They thought they were ganging up on him, and, you know, kind of a thuggery in the San Francisco establishment.

49:06.827 --> 49:10.712
He snuck into the library and measured the shelves.

49:11.053 --> 49:11.273
I know.

49:11.293 --> 49:16.419
He did do a certain amount of sneaking, and also he snuck in and saw the heaps of books that were being thrown around.

49:16.439 --> 49:20.584
And he took down titles, which is wonderful.

49:20.986 --> 49:23.680
documented some of the books that they were discarding.

49:23.700 --> 49:24.042
That's right.

49:24.102 --> 49:25.651
They all sounded like wonderful books.

49:25.671 --> 49:26.676
Yeah, they did.
