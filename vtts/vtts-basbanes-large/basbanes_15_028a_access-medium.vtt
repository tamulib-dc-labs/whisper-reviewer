00:04.334 --> 00:09.322
Okay, I'm Charlie Croyding, which I am.

00:09.482 --> 00:10.304
Okay.

00:10.324 --> 00:30.257
So, for the sake of the tape, we're talking to Catholic chaplain Craig Johnson here at this post here at the HHD 45 CSB, whatever.

00:30.277 --> 00:30.477
Correct.

00:31.317 --> 00:33.879
And you're saying that you were here three years ago?

00:33.920 --> 00:35.261
That's right.

00:35.281 --> 00:36.262
On an earlier posting.

00:36.622 --> 00:37.423
That's right.

00:37.443 --> 00:42.127
And it was during that period when you, I guess, began to study... Exactly.

00:42.167 --> 00:46.732
First became acquainted with the ruins of Ur and the Ziggurat and all that stuff.

00:46.752 --> 00:53.538
So did you go there just because it was there, or do you have kind of an interest in archaeology, history, or...?

00:53.558 --> 01:00.345
Yeah, actually, you know, that was an interesting amount at a young age, and I actually took field school at Koakia Mountains in...

01:00.562 --> 01:03.745
in Illinois right across the river from where I grew up in St.

01:03.765 --> 01:05.767
Louis when I was a teenager.

01:05.887 --> 01:10.231
So archaeology and the ancients have always been an interest of mine.

01:10.271 --> 01:16.917
So that was a great opportunity to see such an amazing relic when we first got here.

01:17.557 --> 01:20.780
At the time there wasn't any organized plan for taking soldiers out there.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.745
Of course security and accomplishing the mission was the foremost thing.

01:25.765 --> 01:28.307
So now it's great to come back and see that we have a regular

01:28.861 --> 01:31.184
regular schedule of arranged tours for the soldiers.

01:31.284 --> 01:35.090
Were you mindful of its place in the Old Testament?

01:35.210 --> 01:36.051
Absolutely.

01:36.071 --> 01:39.436
If you could just give me a little bit about that.

01:39.717 --> 01:39.997
Sure.

01:40.658 --> 01:49.671
In the book of Genesis, Abraham is mentioned as being from Ur of the Chaldeans, and this is

01:50.242 --> 01:57.969
You know, there's no rock-solid evidence that this is the same Ur that we're talking about.

01:58.069 --> 01:58.690
Exactly.

01:59.991 --> 02:07.819
But certainly, you know, things like the ziggurat show that this city was an important place and has been called Ur since the ancient times.

02:07.939 --> 02:09.140
So we know that.

02:09.480 --> 02:09.941
Exactly.

02:10.061 --> 02:16.367
So it's likely that it's very possible that this could be the same Ur discussed in the Bible.

02:16.904 --> 02:20.910
For how long of a period do you suspect it was inhabited?

02:21.510 --> 02:23.173
They estimate several hundred years.

02:23.633 --> 02:37.172
They think that King Hammurabi, the same one that compiled the laws, conquered this area, and then the focus of energy shifted to Babylon, which was where Hammurabi was the ruler.

02:37.292 --> 02:44.262
So Ur kind of dominated the political and geopolitical landscape in this ancient Sumerian.

02:44.731 --> 02:48.977
for a few hundred years until Hammurabi shifted that energy to Babylon.

02:49.317 --> 02:53.923
So we had the Sumerians, we had the Akkadians, we had the Assyrians, we had the Babylonians.

02:53.943 --> 02:54.344
That's right.

02:54.404 --> 02:56.507
Any number of different really extraordinary cultures.

02:56.547 --> 02:57.728
That's correct.

02:58.109 --> 03:04.157
As I tell the soldiers, this is one of the most fought over pieces of real estate in the world.

03:04.593 --> 03:13.982
not because the Iraqis are any more warmongering than anyone else, but simply because civilization has been here so much longer than in other parts.

03:14.002 --> 03:16.685
Was it always a desert, do you think?

03:16.805 --> 03:19.328
It seems like it, a fairly barren land.

03:20.128 --> 03:27.456
At the time of the empire of the Kingdom of Ur, the Euphrates ran a lot closer.

03:27.856 --> 03:31.680
The banks have shifted over the millennia, so now it's several clicks away.

03:32.015 --> 03:36.760
But at the time, it was much closer, so the people could live on the river and make their land.

03:36.780 --> 03:41.965
Isn't this also the legendary home of the Garden of Eden as well, too?

03:42.086 --> 03:43.467
In this same area.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.689
It's another interesting point.

03:45.830 --> 03:51.656
One of my professors in college was Dr. Southwest Missouri State University.

03:51.676 --> 03:52.276
Oh, I've been there.

03:52.396 --> 03:52.797
Oh, have you?

03:52.817 --> 03:54.238
Well, I wrote about it in one of my books.

03:54.338 --> 03:57.842
Yeah, the Grodzky-Frockner collection is now.

03:58.663 --> 03:58.763
Sure.

03:58.783 --> 04:01.566
Yuri Zarens is a— Do you know if I shoot a couple pictures of that?

04:02.052 --> 04:16.392
Yuri Zarens did some research on where the Garden of Eden might be, and this was one of the regions that he picked out in a fascinating series of articles that was published several years ago.

04:18.054 --> 04:28.529
Do we have a, just to switch gears just to that, and don't mind, but of course this post is just, I guess it's coincidental that we're adjoining this site.

04:28.850 --> 04:29.190
Correct.

04:29.710 --> 04:31.993
It's not because of the site.

04:32.593 --> 04:54.578
You know, I have heard, and I'm speaking outside of my range of authority now, but I've heard that Saddam located the post here in order to offer his airbase the protection of the ziggurat during the Iran-Iraq war that the Iranians wouldn't fire on, you know, would be less likely to fire missiles on.

04:54.678 --> 04:57.221
And, you know, that's likely.

04:57.261 --> 04:59.363
You know, Saddam obviously didn't blanch from

04:59.782 --> 05:03.447
putting facilities next to hospitals and other things.

05:03.707 --> 05:08.894
He was going to bomb a monastery.

05:09.495 --> 05:10.055
That's correct.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.199
So that could very well be.

05:13.260 --> 05:22.732
I do know that during Saddam's era, he would not allow people to climb the ziggurat because he didn't want them spying on Tallul.

05:22.752 --> 05:26.357
That vantage point offered a great view of the whole post.

05:26.377 --> 05:28.219
And so he restricted access to the

05:28.840 --> 05:32.565
to climbing the ziggurat for just that reason.

05:32.725 --> 05:43.079
Do we feel a responsibility as Americans, as tenants, or for a period, a responsibility to preserving the ziggurat?

05:43.099 --> 05:43.640
Absolutely.

05:44.001 --> 05:51.371
In fact, we in the chaplain's office here just rewrote the rules for visiting the ziggurat with that in mind.

05:51.911 --> 05:58.240
As I told my supervisor when we wrote those rules, I said, you know, we're the

05:58.608 --> 06:27.433
for four thousand years you know the history is preserved in a snapshot and we're the current caretakers of it temporarily because it's within our security and so if something happened on my watch you know out there i would feel terrible so certainly that the soldiers are always given a pre-brief before they go out and emphasize respect for the site and the significance of the ruins and the privilege it is to go out there and see these things and certainly the the garrison commander i'm sure would have no

06:28.072 --> 06:35.663
recalcitrance about shutting the site down for tours if he feared that soldiers were going to go out there and abuse that privilege.

06:35.984 --> 06:37.686
I was just visiting a couple of weeks ago.

06:37.706 --> 06:44.336
I was out in Nevada when I saw some of these three thousands or so year old petroglyphs, you know.

06:44.356 --> 06:44.657
Sure.

06:45.378 --> 06:49.564
And there's some of these written cards in their name, you know.

06:49.584 --> 06:49.784
Right.

06:50.746 --> 06:51.807
What a desecration!

06:51.847 --> 06:52.668
Yeah, exactly.

06:52.688 --> 06:55.092
And I'm sure we've had similar kinds of

06:55.797 --> 07:05.606
You know, Saddam held things down with such an iron fist that I'm sure no one would have dared to violate those things during his period.

07:05.646 --> 07:10.931
And so now it's a matter of saying, look at what we can learn.

07:10.971 --> 07:17.017
Look at what this tells us about who we are, where our civilization has come from, to preserve this.

07:18.499 --> 07:21.481
Which is why I don't put much emphasis.

07:21.501 --> 07:25.365
I try not to emphasize, well, we just have to do this so it doesn't reflect badly on us.

07:25.818 --> 07:32.328
But to do it in the positive, to say, look at what we benefit from by maintaining and preserving these sites.

07:33.229 --> 07:36.434
And do you, is this one of your duties?

07:36.454 --> 07:36.934
Exactly.

07:37.115 --> 07:38.757
So you have?

07:38.777 --> 07:39.298
That's correct.

07:39.338 --> 07:42.503
I'm kind of the local expert on the site.

07:42.543 --> 07:48.171
So whenever a VIP such as yourself comes through, I'm always referred to to take them out there.

07:48.612 --> 07:52.217
And then all chaplains do tours for their own soldiers.

07:52.237 --> 07:55.622
So I'll take my unit soldiers out there on that.

07:55.805 --> 07:58.127
We go on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

07:58.147 --> 07:59.428
So you mentioned Woolley's book.

08:00.469 --> 08:01.790
Did he pretty much have it right?

08:03.252 --> 08:06.835
Well, you know, Woolley was a biblical archaeologist.

08:06.875 --> 08:14.322
He went out there with an agenda in mind, and so a lot of his findings are an effort to prove his agenda.

08:14.842 --> 08:25.812
So in one of the pits, you can see what he called evidence for Noah's flood, and certainly modern scholars would debate whether that's evidence of

08:26.467 --> 08:30.452
any such thing at all, except for a period where that site flooded.

08:30.813 --> 08:41.848
Now whether it was a worldwide deluge that wiped out all life on earth, well that would be a, that would be a... Well, then the Bushy did come up with the Gildanash Epic, which it does have a flood.

08:41.908 --> 08:43.770
Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

08:43.790 --> 08:47.595
And they did recover one of the texts here, is that right?

08:47.736 --> 08:48.897
That's correct.

08:49.598 --> 08:53.183
And I'd like to point out, you know, you're talking about an epic poem,

08:54.428 --> 08:57.412
that's a thousand years older than the Odyssey and the Iliad.

08:57.433 --> 08:58.634
That's right, that's right.

08:58.654 --> 09:06.466
And it was preserved in its formative, generative state up until the time it was discovered, because it was really discovered in tablets.

09:06.486 --> 09:07.007
That's correct.

09:07.067 --> 09:16.121
Whereas, you know, Homer is passed on orally for hundreds of years, and then the earliest known text, I've handled it, it's at the Marziana in Venice.

09:16.181 --> 09:21.128
It's the Cardinal Busserian, and it's called Seventh-century common era, you know.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.487
And yet, at that point, the poem's been around for a thousand years.

09:25.547 --> 09:26.309
That's right.

09:26.329 --> 09:32.600
It really is quite a remarkable cultural treasure.

09:32.620 --> 09:35.506
It certainly is, on so many different levels.

09:35.626 --> 09:44.382
You know, not just the religious level with the ziggurat and some of the other temples preserved out there, but also

09:44.682 --> 09:51.310
a really good snapshot of everyday life, the everyday houses that they've uncovered out there.

09:51.330 --> 09:53.092
And we'll have a chance to see some of that today.

09:53.112 --> 09:53.933
Absolutely.

09:53.953 --> 10:01.381
And I'm really eager to see anything that imparts to me a formulation of writing.

10:01.822 --> 10:02.002
Sure.

10:02.523 --> 10:07.649
Are there any spaces there that you think may have been libraries or storehouses?

10:08.850 --> 10:13.035
Unlike in Nineveh where they actually found thousands upon thousands of tablets in the

10:13.454 --> 10:18.700
But they've come to call, Archie Byron's palace library, which I had really hoped to get out and see.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.160
Sure.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.882
It's not happening on this trip.

10:20.902 --> 10:32.795
Yeah, you know, one of the really lucky things is we do have this site inside security, you know, inside American security, so that guests can move in there freely.

10:33.175 --> 10:40.443
Places like Nineveh and Babylon and other places, it takes a lot to take a visitor there because it's not within security.

10:40.563 --> 10:43.166
It's problematic at best.

10:43.186 --> 10:43.326
Indeed.

10:43.660 --> 10:55.113
Kind of ironic, isn't it, when you think to, I know from my standpoint, you talk about books, I always feel that where there are books, there's hope, you know.

10:56.735 --> 11:00.259
Have you seen the library at Ephesus?

11:00.319 --> 11:00.680
I have.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.721
That's wonderful.

11:01.801 --> 11:05.405
And in that particular book, of course, I went to Turkey.

11:05.746 --> 11:12.013
I had been to Ephesus with my wife many years ago, first married, but I really wanted to go visit Pergamum.

11:12.466 --> 11:13.347
Oh, yeah.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.188
Which I wrote about.

11:14.829 --> 11:18.715
Because this was really established as the rival library to Alexandria.

11:19.456 --> 11:25.505
And while nothing exists of the original Alexandrian library, the ruins of the Pergamum library are there.

11:25.545 --> 11:29.951
You know, we know where it was, the floor plans.

11:29.991 --> 11:30.252
Right.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.214
And that really was something for me to go in.

11:33.136 --> 11:34.778
I really get something when I...

11:35.585 --> 11:39.491
walk among the spirits of the ancients or whatever.

11:39.571 --> 11:40.332
I really feel it.

11:40.392 --> 11:41.514
I feel it very profoundly.

11:42.215 --> 11:44.558
I'm really looking forward to this.

11:44.578 --> 11:54.032
My last assignment being in Naples, Italy, I took my folks and other people to come visit me out to Pompeii, and you get that same kind of feeling walking through Pompeii.

11:54.052 --> 11:56.135
That's a frozen Italian thing.

11:56.155 --> 11:57.838
Even the graffiti there.

11:58.238 --> 12:00.602
Isn't that amazing?

12:00.642 --> 12:04.988
It just tells you how much the Romans, how literate so many of them work.

12:05.028 --> 12:05.389
That's right.

12:05.622 --> 12:13.891
You know the most visited artifact in the British Museum?

12:14.311 --> 12:18.636
And even I think it's more so than the Parthenon Frieses.

12:18.676 --> 12:19.617
The Rosetta Stone?

12:19.637 --> 12:20.098
Exactly.

12:20.198 --> 12:20.859
And it's a text.

12:20.939 --> 12:22.640
When you look at it, it's a text.

12:24.823 --> 12:27.346
You've got it right on your head.

12:27.446 --> 12:31.410
It's the Rosetta Stone that you're penetrating a civilization

12:32.268 --> 12:36.415
that cared enough to write about itself or to write something down.

12:37.096 --> 12:38.658
And do we get a sense of that out here?

12:39.740 --> 12:48.454
Yeah, you know, I think that the living history beyond that is in the Iraqis that live and work around the site, you know.

12:50.136 --> 12:58.630
Saddam worked hard, it's kind of funny, Saddam worked hard to kind of represent himself as the next Nebuchadnezzar, you know, so many of his

12:58.998 --> 13:24.786
of the seals and things that he would put up would show his face and profile with Nebuchadnezzar like he was you can yeah you can buy some of that stuff at the little souvenir stand and he pushed so hard to make that image up and yet you know I think that the real living history is is captured in the common people not not in you know some pompous display of of arrogant power but in

13:25.070 --> 13:29.136
and the ordinary Iraqis who still live and work around the site.

13:29.396 --> 13:34.683
You know, I always tell soldiers we're lucky in the sense that if this were in the United States, you wouldn't get anywhere near it.

13:34.864 --> 13:38.669
You know, there'd be a big fence around it, and you'd take a look at it from a distance.

13:38.689 --> 13:43.215
And only scientists and archaeologists would be allowed to actually approach it.

13:43.235 --> 13:52.308
But here, everything, you know, you can walk down into the tombs and climb to the top of the ziggurat and walk through the House of Abraham, and it's all so... And we're going to do all that today.

13:52.328 --> 13:52.528
Certainly.

13:52.795 --> 14:17.942
it's all so uh so approachable and i think that's part of the you know part of the the great thing about the ruins is you know it was the great depression that stopped will leave's dig he had to return to britain because he just ran out of funds and so in a lot of ways it's still sitting there the way it was when he left it in 1934 you know he uh he backfilled some of the pits that were simply open holes to protect the local people from

14:18.243 --> 14:47.608
falling in them but so much of what he uncovered is uncovered exactly the way he uncovered it and has it been despoiled at all in the years you know obviously all the artifacts have been removed any any vestige of anything he might have found that was worth anything but really no it's it's in remarkable shape given uh given the building materials they had and and the kind of weather we have in this part of the world it's it's all in remarkable shape as you'll see and there's uh i was talking to a pilot last night

14:48.331 --> 14:49.272
flies as Sherpas.

14:50.754 --> 14:53.397
And he's a Vietnam War veteran, too, if you can believe it.

14:53.417 --> 14:56.120
He actually flew helicopters.

14:56.180 --> 14:59.263
And here he is flying Sherpas again.

14:59.283 --> 14:59.904
He's 58 years old.

15:00.465 --> 15:01.326
That's a very interesting story.

15:01.346 --> 15:01.906
Absolutely.

15:01.926 --> 15:05.010
But he said, when he's up there flying, he's been thinking quite every year.

15:05.030 --> 15:15.081
And he said, it's remarkable to me that such a great series of civilizations that emerged from this area where there is no, and I never thought of this, no

15:15.584 --> 15:18.728
You made an adjective out of it, no quariable stone.

15:20.270 --> 15:24.816
And I said, gee, you know, they had to really do things differently.

15:24.856 --> 15:27.499
And that explains the architecture, I guess.

15:27.599 --> 15:37.632
And then I thought that also explains the way they developed their writing system, because it was really incised into clay tablets, which they either baked or put out in the sun to dry.

15:38.453 --> 15:43.600
But yet, the first has also proven to be the most resilient, indeed.

15:43.934 --> 15:47.297
You know, it's not like paper or papyrus or any other medium.

15:47.778 --> 15:51.922
And you know, they didn't fire their bricks, they sun-dried their bricks.

15:51.942 --> 15:52.723
They sun-dried them.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.024
They were baked in the sun.

15:54.044 --> 15:55.986
Right.

15:56.006 --> 16:00.951
So even that is such a perishable medium.

16:01.651 --> 16:06.776
And when you consider the size of the things they produced, you know, in this country.

16:07.177 --> 16:09.259
Like I say, the ziggurat is an impressive thing at all.

16:09.279 --> 16:13.823
But other places in Iraq, like Hatra and Nineveh and Babylon,

16:14.309 --> 16:23.358
Just remarkable stuff, given the, like you say, the lack of stone and other building blocks that the Romans and Greeks used to create.

16:23.438 --> 16:27.562
So which is larger, actually, than this one, or is Nineveh more?

16:28.103 --> 16:29.004
This is the largest.

16:29.064 --> 16:32.447
The ziggurat here is the largest ziggurat in the world.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.969
It's the best preserved and largest ziggurat in the world.

16:34.989 --> 16:36.311
Now what exactly is a ziggurat?

16:36.331 --> 16:41.196
How do you distinguish it from, say, a pyramid or whatever?

16:41.216 --> 16:41.916
Correct.

16:41.936 --> 16:43.658
A ziggurat is a step pyramid.

16:44.262 --> 16:52.175
And so the architectural difference is that you start with a level and then build up from there.

16:52.195 --> 17:01.750
And a ziggurat's main function is to elevate the temple to the top, to put the temple as high as you can.

17:02.230 --> 17:08.140
Whereas a pyramid has the burial chambers and all that kind of thing in it.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.724
A ziggurat's a solid structure.

17:10.764 --> 17:11.485
There's no...

17:11.836 --> 17:15.901
There's no passageways or burial chambers in the ziggurat.

17:16.342 --> 17:20.267
If you peel away the layer of bricks, you just find a mound of mud underneath.

17:20.367 --> 17:23.071
And its function was, obviously, it was a holy site.

17:23.091 --> 17:23.711
That's correct.

17:24.152 --> 17:26.235
Veneration of their own, their deities.

17:26.315 --> 17:27.256
Exactly.

17:27.356 --> 17:29.519
It's believed that the temple was to the moon god.

17:29.940 --> 17:35.407
There's no, again, the proofs of that are scarce, but that's the best guess.

17:35.427 --> 17:40.053
But there are no inscriptions there that would suggest anything else to it.

17:40.073 --> 17:40.273
No, no.

17:40.692 --> 17:51.525
And in fact, you know, the ziggurat was considered a lost monument when Woolley came here.

17:52.065 --> 17:56.951
So a lot of what you'll see was kind of refinished in the 60s to give it a cleaner look.

17:57.792 --> 18:05.000
But there was a mound of sand covering it, and then Woolley basically uncovered it and showed where the staircases were and that kind of thing.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.163
So the upper two layers are gone now.

18:07.223 --> 18:09.906
All that remains is the lower central level.

18:11.354 --> 18:11.975
When was it built?

18:12.937 --> 18:16.683
It was built 2100 B.C., so about 4,000 years ago.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.528
Yeah.

18:19.548 --> 18:22.633
And do you find it unfortunate that they did try to rebuild it?

18:24.877 --> 18:34.834
You know, after a sense, but when you've seen, you know, when I was here three years ago, I traveled all over Iraq and saw some of the other ziggurats, and some of them are in such wretched shape.

18:34.894 --> 18:36.417
It's really just...

18:36.852 --> 18:37.833
a mound of mud.

18:37.953 --> 18:41.836
You know, it doesn't look any different than any other mound of mud in the States.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.419
Or some of them are just a small pile of bricks around a foundation.

18:45.880 --> 18:51.444
So here I think it preserves the central idea of the ziggurat.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.526
And some of the layers are original.

18:53.586 --> 18:54.707
Not all the bricks are new.

18:55.067 --> 19:00.212
But mostly they just kind of refinish the edges along the top and some other areas.

19:00.552 --> 19:04.015
You can definitely tell what's a new brick and what's an ancient brick.

19:04.035 --> 19:06.437
So no, I don't think it detracts from the site.

19:06.569 --> 19:12.915
I think had they rebuilt it all and put a new temple on top and all that, then it would have, I think that would have taken something away.

19:12.975 --> 19:16.159
Now you get the essential character of the monument without that.

19:16.319 --> 19:29.692
Especially to check on the observation of the chief last night, who is flying over this countryside, and he says how remarkable it is that they have no, and he used it, made an adjective, no quarryable stone.

19:30.493 --> 19:32.014
And so these are bricks that were made.

19:32.635 --> 19:35.878
So it really is quite an advanced civilization.

19:35.938 --> 19:36.559
It's not just

19:37.079 --> 19:43.105
It's not just carving stone out of the landscape and getting slaves to move it in place.

19:43.145 --> 19:44.107
You're actually pyramids.

19:44.667 --> 19:45.948
Yeah, like pyramids.

19:46.990 --> 19:56.580
No, I see the accomplishments of the ancient citizens at Ur to be on the same, and Nineveh, to be on the same level as the Romans and the Greeks as far as their architecture is concerned.

19:56.640 --> 19:56.960
Sure.

19:57.461 --> 20:04.268
They use the arch, the inclined plane, and all of these other

20:04.788 --> 20:13.120
you know, things that the Romans are so famous for, innovating, they were doing it a thousand years before the Romans started building.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.403
It was still Etruscan building.

20:15.443 --> 20:16.384
Exactly.

20:16.444 --> 20:19.288
How large did the community here?

20:19.328 --> 20:21.451
I think it was like 4,000 years ago.

20:21.471 --> 20:21.992
Exactly.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.133
How did they get their water?

20:23.934 --> 20:31.525
The Euphrates at the time ran much closer to the site, so actually this was on the banks of the Euphrates at the time.

20:31.545 --> 20:33.748
But 4,000 is a pretty good metropolitan area.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.957
I mean, how do they deal with such things as sewage and, you know, water?

20:38.037 --> 20:39.178
Well, of course, you have to have a natural.

20:39.619 --> 20:41.140
Sure.

20:41.160 --> 20:47.867
You'll see some of the drain plumbing system, the rudimentary plumbing system that they had within the houses out there.

20:47.907 --> 21:00.360
The drains are still in place, and so you'll see the way they would drain off rainwater, and, you know, I'm sure they had systems for moving, you know, animals and so forth for moving water up from the river.

21:00.914 --> 21:02.496
Let me hear what we're doing.

21:02.576 --> 21:07.604
After being down there, he's waiting for the S-1's guy to come back with an NTP.

21:07.904 --> 21:12.070
If that doesn't fail, after about 15, 20 minutes, we have to do a Humvee.

21:12.591 --> 21:14.914
We know where we'll be able to get out there.

21:14.934 --> 21:19.781
He'll run over and pick up some y'alls, Kevlar and stuff.

21:20.703 --> 21:23.587
And then... Take the Kevlar out of there?

21:23.607 --> 21:26.651
Yeah, you gotta wear the... To ride a Humvee, you gotta wear a Kevlar as a Humvee.

21:26.731 --> 21:28.474
But I think at this point,

21:29.213 --> 21:40.266
If it's an issue of seeing or not seeing... So in the meantime, I don't know what you guys, what all you have to say is to cover, but... I'm really very eager to get out to the site.

21:41.928 --> 21:43.129
He's trying to say that right now.

21:43.149 --> 21:44.851
They're waiting for the Sergeant Major to come back.

21:44.911 --> 21:48.455
I can't believe the buses don't go out there.

21:48.475 --> 21:54.242
Is it just not... The problem is, sir, that we don't want people going out to the site.

21:56.517 --> 22:26.457
i thought it might be a museum i didn't know what it was as i learned later it was a documentary center but there it is papers scattered all over the floor and the door had been broken so i closed the doors and put my lock off of my duffel bag on it just because i felt you know i didn't know what that would do but you were 101st at the time no actually i was in the gulf court with 101st i was chaplain for the 7th transportation battalion four uses three years ago so

22:27.162 --> 22:34.832
We were at the original Camp Cedar, and I had people here on Tallil, and I'd come over and visit them every week, so I'd stop by and just take a look.

22:34.852 --> 22:45.586
But near the end of the war, they did string barbed wire across the entrance to, I'd say probably in April or May, they strung barbed wire across the entrance to hurry and keep people out.

22:45.606 --> 22:50.693
And then they controlled the chaplains, kind of fell into that job of taking people out for tours.

22:51.214 --> 22:56.781
Now, when I got back here last November, you know, it was definitely codified into the chaplains,

22:57.301 --> 22:58.322
ran the show out there.

22:58.662 --> 23:08.373
And as I was just telling him, I had a hand in rewriting the regulations for the site just to kind of control access even further.

23:08.453 --> 23:20.185
There was not really abuses, but just people were treating it as more, you know, I just want to go out there and let's all stand on the steps and pull the American flag up and that kind of stuff.

23:20.345 --> 23:24.169
And we just wanted to keep a closer reign on that kind of stuff.

23:24.571 --> 23:30.062
I noticed, and I mentioned this to Nick, is it Chaplain Rahim?

23:30.764 --> 23:31.946
Is that what you say, Chaplain?

23:31.966 --> 23:32.848
Chaplain Rahim.

23:33.229 --> 23:36.195
26 years in the Army, he's the first Muslim chaplain I've ever seen.

23:36.255 --> 23:42.288
I've seen the AFN commercial or whatever it is where they show one, but I did notice it here.

23:42.308 --> 23:44.773
I'm curious, does he do a different...

23:45.715 --> 23:47.578
perspective of the ziggurat?

23:47.658 --> 23:49.381
Actually, he's not stationed here.

23:49.461 --> 23:51.805
He's just on a tour through Iraq.

23:51.965 --> 23:57.394
He's actually back in Hanau, Germany, with me, in the same area as my unit.

23:57.554 --> 23:59.176
He's just come through for a week.

24:00.278 --> 24:04.124
He's been out there for a tour, but he's not conducting any tours out there.

24:04.144 --> 24:08.071
Have there been archaeologists that have requested to come out and see it?

24:08.171 --> 24:08.972
Not so far.

24:09.138 --> 24:25.797
actually sir one of the programs that i'm working on is to uh i would like to under under the guise of the uso i would like to bring some experts over here to give them a chance to see the site and to give a talk to the you know talk to the soldiers about it

24:26.266 --> 24:54.366
one of my professors from seminary and one of my professors from college are both very knowledgeable about the area and of course during the saddam era all that was was impossible after the gulf war and then you know it'll be another 20 years at least before this country's stable enough for that kind of work to begin in earnest so i would i would imagine so i i just i've written the uso and and you know it's part of my naively kind of bumping around in the dark to try and figure out how to do this but

24:54.346 --> 25:18.396
i'd love to be able to bring you know some guys over here like i say they could give a talk to the troops and you know that would serve their function as far as what contribution they make to the army but they would also give some of these scholars and so they couldn't guarantee he interrupt correct so he couldn't so he did not end up coming here but they rebuilt the house of abraham for his for his visit

25:18.730 --> 25:20.493
And they did a beautiful job.

25:20.513 --> 25:25.099
They used the same—they made the building materials the same way they made them 2,000 years ago.

25:25.420 --> 25:27.663
How can they be sure it was the House of Abraham?

25:27.683 --> 25:29.726
Is that just a speculative— Yes, exactly.

25:29.746 --> 25:39.080
The same as—the other chaplains get mad at me when I say that, but it's the same as when you pull—whenever they pull a boat from the floor of the Sea of Galilee, it's always Peter's boat, you know?

25:39.100 --> 25:41.523
What were the debates over where the ark landed?

25:41.543 --> 25:45.889
Well, the chaplain was saying that earlier, you know, that this is the site of the flood, Willie, this is the thing.

25:45.930 --> 25:46.290
Right.

25:46.793 --> 25:51.159
And the other thing is too, this is kind of like Salzburg is for Mozart fans.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.923
Everybody goes to Salzburg for the big Mozart festival.

25:54.263 --> 25:59.090
Mozart hated Salzburg and couldn't wait to get the heck out of there.

25:59.270 --> 26:06.861
In Salzburg though, every other street corner is Mozart flops and there's a statue of Mozart here and a house of Mozart here.

26:07.246 --> 26:08.207
Yeah, right.

26:08.347 --> 26:13.232
And the fact is, Mozart didn't like being in Salzburg and got out of it as soon as he got old enough to leave home.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.694
And Abraham was the same way with Ur.

26:15.754 --> 26:17.796
He didn't spend much time here in Ur.

26:17.836 --> 26:23.821
He was born here, but then all of his significant acts in his life were outside of Ur.

26:23.841 --> 26:30.347
So Ur can claim him, but it's not like this was all of Abraham's life.

26:31.308 --> 26:33.771
He definitely lives here, though.

26:33.791 --> 26:36.493
I mean, is that part pretty...

26:37.250 --> 26:45.038
So much as you can rely on ancient literature, so much as you can rely on that this is the same earth, that's what the ancients were talking about.

26:45.298 --> 26:47.200
And it meets a lot of the requirements.

26:47.280 --> 26:53.987
Certainly, we can't be for sure, it's been so long ago, but certainly this meets a lot of the requirements of the ancient earth.

26:54.007 --> 26:57.330
It was a city of great size and a city of great wealth.

26:57.350 --> 27:01.755
The house of Abraham that they rebuilt, they basically rebuilt one of the larger houses out there.

27:01.775 --> 27:05.779
They built it along the original foundation.

27:05.799 --> 27:06.700
So that...

27:07.169 --> 27:11.994
What does the word er mean?

27:14.397 --> 27:21.865
Does it mean original?

27:21.885 --> 27:24.108
Well, it's come to mean that.

27:24.128 --> 27:25.789
Yeah, it's come to mean the first.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.152
Like you said, the er text.

27:28.172 --> 27:33.598
Well, it's like Rosetta Stone has come to mean the means by which you

27:33.798 --> 27:37.824
You decipher, but Rosetta was just the name of a place where they found a stone.

27:37.844 --> 27:40.027
It's a place name.

27:40.047 --> 27:40.527
It's a name.

27:41.709 --> 27:43.371
I have not heard any meaning attached to it.

27:44.212 --> 27:48.438
I've heard theories, but it's just a place name.

27:48.598 --> 27:53.605
And in the study of manuscripts, they use the phrase, it's the Ur text.

27:54.366 --> 27:57.731
The Ur text, of course, is the original text.

28:00.114 --> 28:02.117
Are you contemplating writing anything...

28:02.941 --> 28:04.963
out of your experience working at this?

28:04.983 --> 28:07.547
It's kind of a historic... I've written a couple of things.

28:07.627 --> 28:13.614
I wrote one for my denominational magazine, you know, and that kind of thing for my seminary newsletter.

28:14.134 --> 28:15.376
Do you have a copy of it?

28:15.476 --> 28:16.377
Just a little brief thing.

28:16.898 --> 28:18.079
Well, would it be possible to get a copy?

28:18.199 --> 28:19.721
Would you want something like that, Nick?

28:19.781 --> 28:20.562
I'd love it, sure.

28:20.782 --> 28:21.623
I could work on that.

28:22.224 --> 28:22.745
Okay.

28:22.765 --> 28:25.168
Actually, I'll give you my card, too.

28:25.188 --> 28:25.288
Okay.

28:25.788 --> 28:28.291
I mean, I think we already have an email anyway, but... Sure.

28:28.812 --> 28:31.595
I'm trying to... You know, I'm looking at this with two perspectives right now.

28:31.615 --> 28:32.256
I'm looking at it...

28:34.126 --> 28:40.094
Some of the things Daith has said I can't find any, you know, I can't find in the research.

28:40.214 --> 28:47.523
One of the things Daith will know from every group coming out here is this is the oldest arch in the world.

28:48.224 --> 28:50.207
This is the oldest standing arch in the world.

28:50.928 --> 28:52.790
If it's 4,000 years old, then it is.

28:53.131 --> 28:55.013
It's older than any Roman ruin.

28:56.395 --> 29:02.563
But, of course, the Chinese, there are a dozen other cultures that competed with us for ancient ruins, so I don't know.

29:03.218 --> 29:04.940
It's not in the literature anywhere.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.684
But this is a temple to a pantheon of God.

29:09.145 --> 29:19.717
This is a smaller temple that the common people would come to on their way to worship.

29:19.737 --> 29:24.402
I can guarantee you it was.

29:24.582 --> 29:29.968
The original bricks, some of these in and along here are the original bricks.

29:30.370 --> 29:33.935
The original bricks, of course, as we talked about, were dried in the sun.

29:33.955 --> 29:35.117
They were not kiln-fired.

29:35.518 --> 29:37.881
And they are mortared with tar.

29:37.901 --> 29:41.346
And if it's a gray tar, like right in here, then it's original.

29:41.667 --> 29:42.528
This is cement.

29:42.868 --> 29:46.674
And Woolley would have refinished this.

29:47.295 --> 29:52.583
So in order to keep this arch standing, some of the bricks he kind of remortared and filled in with cement.

29:52.603 --> 29:53.865
So which is an original again?

29:53.885 --> 29:56.288
This is an original here, this gray kind of tar.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.892
And this is obviously cement.

29:59.851 --> 30:03.196
There's many places throughout the ruins.

30:03.216 --> 30:04.538
Black tar, an inch thick.

30:07.984 --> 30:13.252
The original tar was a sap tar, not a petroleum-based one, so it's kind of gray.

30:20.463 --> 30:24.389
So this was a temple.

30:24.670 --> 30:28.035
The altar, you know, the place where the gods were kept, were up on this one.

30:28.825 --> 30:30.287
and then the worshippers were down here.

30:31.429 --> 30:37.738
Woolley capped the walls in the 30s with cement in order to keep the walls standing except for that layer of cement.

30:54.663 --> 30:56.646
And that arch has not been rebuilt.

30:56.846 --> 30:57.347
That's correct.

30:58.103 --> 31:04.749
They basically just shorted up by, like I say, inserting some cement in between the bricks on the sides.

31:04.789 --> 31:10.835
But the arch itself was, according to Dye, is the oldest standing arch.

31:10.855 --> 31:14.178
And they estimate the age of it again?

31:14.538 --> 31:16.680
About equal with the big round.

31:16.741 --> 31:17.461
2100.

31:17.481 --> 31:25.449
Isn't that something?

31:25.469 --> 31:27.891
Very astonishing.

31:28.529 --> 31:31.273
Now, what's this on top, this covering?

31:31.453 --> 31:32.695
Is that authentic, too?

31:32.715 --> 31:40.346
Right, this cemented instrument that Leonard Woolley kept with in the 1930s in order to keep the walls standing.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.489
So, not necessarily a bad thing?

31:42.750 --> 31:42.970
No.

31:43.711 --> 31:47.837
Obviously, I'm sure it's helped to work together.

32:05.452 --> 32:17.757
There's usually a reason for us to be selected.

32:58.692 --> 33:15.468
My understanding is all the signs I've been out of here before, they tend to say it with a pro-Saddam kind of glance.

33:15.488 --> 33:18.351
And they haven't been there either.

33:18.371 --> 33:23.196
They don't really mention Saddam, they just mention like the greatness of the kingdom, you know.

33:23.216 --> 33:28.581
There's one very pro-Saddam sign in the parking lot, which is all painted

33:45.790 --> 34:13.823
These bricks, basically, when this was uncovered,

34:14.647 --> 34:19.072
Right, the walls had fallen over and Woolie just basically cleaned out.

34:23.396 --> 34:25.819
But these are original, yes, these walls.

34:25.859 --> 34:26.540
Remarkable.

34:27.301 --> 34:34.789
How far back this way, like, do those cover, are those covered part of the site as well?

34:34.889 --> 34:38.713
Yeah, we're going to go all the way, almost to the road.

34:46.658 --> 35:12.504
That is not what the tinea form was, though.

35:12.524 --> 35:16.368
Well, we're going to get there, right?

35:16.388 --> 35:16.528
Uh-huh.

35:16.548 --> 35:16.568
.

35:16.588 --> 35:16.608
.

35:16.628 --> 35:16.648
.

35:47.797 --> 35:55.868
Your father and your grandfather as well?

35:55.908 --> 35:56.149
Yes.

35:56.169 --> 35:59.273
My grandfather, he walked here in 1922.

35:59.854 --> 36:03.239
My father also, he walked here in 1912.

36:03.259 --> 36:06.103
And I walked here in 1913.

36:07.585 --> 36:10.749
What do you learn from your grandfather and your father about this place?

36:10.809 --> 36:14.314
What kinds of things do they teach you?

36:14.334 --> 36:14.414
Yes.

36:14.434 --> 36:16.437
I know that they teach you

36:17.075 --> 36:23.903
They wrote it in a map, but from my father and my grandfather, which has this building and this building and the same old.

36:24.664 --> 36:29.170
They're talking about the stories of the excavators who walked them and the objects which they found.

36:30.592 --> 36:38.221
Also, they're talking about the places which excavated only and the places not excavated.

36:38.361 --> 36:41.305
And they thought that the excavators, they excavated only the top.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.027
They not reached to the real land.

36:43.528 --> 36:45.310
Some of the excavators, when they excavated,

36:45.745 --> 36:51.671
they're taking these objects and putting it in places not excavated.

36:51.791 --> 37:02.863
So they felt that this was not good because they're not excavated that places and then taking the remains of what was just excavated this place and putting it in another side, not excavated.

37:04.284 --> 37:07.367
How many great things do you think still remain to be anterior?

37:09.389 --> 37:14.875
I thought when they excavated in the future they found more than now because

37:15.378 --> 37:18.583
All the excavators, they excavated just some parts.

37:19.284 --> 37:22.469
And also, all the excavators, they not reach to the real land.

37:23.069 --> 37:25.673
They excavated only the top.

37:25.693 --> 37:30.741
And my grandfather, he said to me that the richest layer, the deepest.

37:31.863 --> 37:38.493
The layer which is a tablet and important things, not on the top.

37:38.513 --> 37:39.754
And what was your grandfather's name?

37:40.155 --> 37:42.178
My grandfather called Hussein.

37:42.445 --> 37:46.689
My father is called Mohsen, and my name is Dyer.

37:47.289 --> 37:57.958
My grandfather, he worked with Sir Leonard Willey, an excavator from America, from the Museum of Pennsylvania University.

37:57.978 --> 38:02.502
Do you think that there are still some tablets, uniform tablets here?

38:02.522 --> 38:05.985
Yes, sir, because time of Saddam is 35 years.

38:06.045 --> 38:11.490
He does not give his attention to the ancient cities, to the tourism, to the excavation.

38:12.010 --> 38:18.818
When they rebuilt the house of Prophet Abraham because the Pope wanted to hear, they excavated just some places.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.043
And not a big group.

38:23.904 --> 38:33.015
Excavator only, the group, the workers, a number of them, not many, and they found tablets, jars, gold.

38:33.516 --> 38:33.896
Really?

38:34.036 --> 38:34.236
Yes.

38:34.256 --> 38:39.463
So this means that when they excavated in the future, they found many things.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.545
Because small group, and they found these things.

38:41.947 --> 38:44.029
Thank you.

38:44.309 --> 38:45.971
Thank you.

38:45.991 --> 38:46.792
Thank you.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.113
Thank you, sir.

38:48.133 --> 38:48.414
Thank you.

38:48.514 --> 38:49.094
Thank you, sir.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.215
It's a pleasure to meet you.

38:50.235 --> 38:50.716
Good luck.

38:51.056 --> 38:52.458
Thank you.

38:52.478 --> 38:55.921
Were you here in 1994?

38:56.021 --> 38:56.482
Exactly.

38:56.542 --> 38:57.543
I worked here in 1995.

38:57.723 --> 38:59.585
I was here in 1994.

38:59.605 --> 39:03.509
Yes, I am here as a house, but I worked here in 1995.

39:04.310 --> 39:07.253
There was an Iraqi here when I came here before.

39:07.273 --> 39:08.534
Yes, my grandfather, my father.

39:09.195 --> 39:11.397
You seemed older and more...

39:12.288 --> 39:12.729
Punched.

39:13.630 --> 39:14.631
Old man?

39:15.412 --> 39:16.774
I can't remember.

39:16.834 --> 39:18.216
Older than you.

39:18.657 --> 39:19.478
Imitator credits?

39:20.860 --> 39:21.761
I don't know.

39:21.781 --> 39:24.464
I have pictures, but they're in the United States.

39:24.845 --> 39:25.305
They're in a box.

39:26.046 --> 39:28.109
Yeah, because another here, many, they came.

39:28.590 --> 39:29.631
Yes, my father, he was here.

39:29.671 --> 39:35.359
But in 1991, also, some of the village, some of them from the center of the city came to here.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.563
Because there have been many problems there.

39:38.904 --> 39:40.225
So some of them, they came here.

39:40.306 --> 39:41.367
Another go to the desert.

39:41.853 --> 39:52.049
And because here America, 1991, so the people came to here, they thought the police or the security forces of Saddam, they not came to catch them here.

39:52.549 --> 39:55.594
So yes, maybe my father, you must him.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.617
What is your favorite place of the whole site?

39:59.720 --> 40:04.688
The royal tombs and the ziggurat, all of them, the house of Prophet Abraham also.

40:04.921 --> 40:09.309
So you cannot see what they have.

40:09.449 --> 40:12.335
All of them ancient cities, all of them things.

40:12.375 --> 40:18.446
But in my idea, the royal prunes under the ground and everything.

40:18.466 --> 40:22.994
But also the house of Prophet Abraham, this is also important.

40:23.014 --> 40:23.375
Thank you.

40:23.575 --> 40:23.976
Thank you.
