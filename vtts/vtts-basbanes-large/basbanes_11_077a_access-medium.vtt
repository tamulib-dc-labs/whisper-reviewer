WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:05.244
So we're talking, could you pronounce your name?

00:06.166 --> 00:06.847
Clabroy.

00:06.867 --> 00:07.488
Clabroy.

00:07.768 --> 00:09.370
Bernard Clabroy.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.192
Uh-huh.

00:10.212 --> 00:11.474
And Stéphane.

00:11.494 --> 00:12.255
And Stéphane.

00:13.036 --> 00:16.381
And how if I put this here so it's close to you two.

00:18.484 --> 00:22.630
So you're four generations of booksellers, is that correct?

00:22.650 --> 00:25.274
Yes, my father's grandfather was already there.

00:25.294 --> 00:26.917
Yes.

00:26.937 --> 00:27.838
In this place.

00:27.858 --> 00:28.499
In this place.

00:29.340 --> 00:31.303
At the beginning, it was a century.

00:32.077 --> 00:38.764
In 1900, he moved in, actually it's 1902 or something like that, he moved in this shop.

00:38.784 --> 00:43.909
Before, he wasn't in the neighborhood before, about 10 minutes from there.

00:45.210 --> 00:48.113
And he moved in 1902.

00:48.213 --> 00:51.516
And his father before him was a bookseller?

00:51.617 --> 00:56.401
No, he's a fourth generation, that's right.

00:56.421 --> 00:58.964
Yeah, because that's under fourth.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.067
My father is third, my grandfather was second,

01:02.435 --> 01:06.239
And my great-grandfather was the first generation.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.403
How does it happen that, you know, how do you decide?

01:10.563 --> 01:12.665
Why did you decide to be a bookseller?

01:12.685 --> 01:16.009
Well, I just... You don't decide.

01:16.029 --> 01:19.652
You just... You don't have to decide.

01:20.573 --> 01:24.717
You just enjoy your being with books or not.

01:25.578 --> 01:26.379
You don't have to think.

01:26.399 --> 01:27.520
You don't even think about it.

01:28.141 --> 01:32.205
So both of you probably can never remember not being around books.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.492
Books have always been a part of your life.

01:35.093 --> 01:35.574
Yeah, definitely.

01:35.594 --> 01:37.176
Books have always been a part of your life.

01:38.237 --> 01:41.381
And your father was a bookseller in this shop?

01:41.782 --> 01:42.743
No, no.

01:42.823 --> 01:43.404
Okay.

01:43.824 --> 01:46.147
There's another Clarois shop.

01:46.167 --> 01:46.487
I see.

01:46.648 --> 01:58.943
Because the story is that my great-grandfather, who was in this shop, in 1900, had two children, a daughter and a son.

02:00.005 --> 02:02.007
The daughter was the eldest of the children.

02:02.290 --> 02:07.836
And she started the business, I mean, she started to work with her father.

02:09.237 --> 02:17.747
And the son, who was my dad's father, went to work with his father's best friend.

02:17.767 --> 02:20.830
He went to another shop in the rue Saint-Permain-des-Arts.

02:22.252 --> 02:30.120
And in the 20s, he went there in the 20s, early 20s, 24.

02:30.927 --> 02:32.448
1922.

02:32.529 --> 02:42.077
And so there was a library with my great-grandfather and his daughter.

02:42.938 --> 02:50.125
And another shop called Magrath with the son, the Clavroy, who was working in Rue Saint-Pondre-des-Arts.

02:50.145 --> 02:58.473
And in the 30s, after having worked with this guy called Magrath for 10 years, my grandfather bought the shop in Rue Saint-Pondre-des-Arts.

02:59.033 --> 03:00.715
So there were two big shops in Clavroy.

03:02.045 --> 03:05.550
And have you always dealt in the same kinds of books?

03:07.012 --> 03:10.477
Why don't you tell us a little bit about what you call it?

03:10.497 --> 03:24.177
Well, first, the great-grandfather started when he was more working in military groups, history, and French history and military history.

03:24.258 --> 03:25.960
And that was his main subject.

03:26.547 --> 03:30.433
And could you tell us the names of your grandfather and your great-grandfather?

03:30.553 --> 03:31.374
Charles Clavroy.

03:31.414 --> 03:33.557
Charles was the great-grandfather.

03:33.878 --> 03:35.620
My father is Raymond.

03:35.640 --> 03:35.881
Raymond.

03:35.901 --> 03:38.445
Okay.

03:38.465 --> 03:42.130
And tell us a little bit about what you do here now.

03:42.210 --> 03:48.019
And you know, what's funny in the story is that the great-grandfather had two children.

03:48.059 --> 03:54.188
The eldest one worked with the father, and the young one went to work with his best friend.

03:54.949 --> 03:55.069
I see.

03:55.285 --> 03:58.829
And then, the young one was my dad's father.

04:00.271 --> 04:23.638
And again, my dad's father had two children, two boys, and the eldest son, which means that the eldest son worked with my grandfather down in the rue Saint-Germain-les-Arts, and the young son, my father, went to work with the man who had bought the shop when my great-grandfather died, Lucien Chelaire,

04:25.289 --> 04:29.235
and who was at that time my grandfather's best friend.

04:29.675 --> 04:35.684
And so my father went to work with Lucien Chelaire in the 60s, early 60s.

04:35.704 --> 04:43.676
And then he bought back from Lucien Chelaire the shop which Lucien Chelaire had bought from the Claveroy in the 30s.

04:43.977 --> 04:44.057
Wow.

04:44.357 --> 04:52.309
Monsieur Chelaire, he's the gentleman who was, I think we had an exchange of...

04:52.728 --> 04:57.313
He's the one losing in Istanbul, yes.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.955
He was 95 years old.

04:59.716 --> 05:04.881
Now, were you able to operate during the war?

05:05.062 --> 05:08.165
Was it possible to have business?

05:08.526 --> 05:14.732
Well, you know, during the war it was a little difficult, because Lucier Chalet was a communist.

05:15.373 --> 05:15.794
Really?

05:15.834 --> 05:16.615
Yeah.

05:16.635 --> 05:17.716
In Paris?

05:17.796 --> 05:20.659
Still is.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.221
That's funny.

05:27.826 --> 05:28.247
Really.

05:29.468 --> 05:32.572
And, you know, during the war, the shop was opened here.

05:33.032 --> 05:33.333
Right here?

05:33.433 --> 05:33.673
Yes.

05:34.073 --> 05:37.397
And he was living upstairs on the top floor of the building.

05:37.998 --> 05:43.704
And in the same apartment, you know the French writer Paul Éloire?

05:43.925 --> 05:44.245
Yes.

05:44.265 --> 05:45.426
He was his best friend.

05:45.767 --> 05:46.167
Really?

05:46.267 --> 05:47.108
In this building?

05:47.128 --> 05:49.391
In this building, yes.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.612
Paul Éloire is communist.

05:50.896 --> 05:52.898
Yeah, probably while I was a communist, too.

05:53.318 --> 05:58.384
And we were being hidden in the flag upstairs.

05:58.424 --> 06:02.147
This was not a safe place to be during the war if you were a communist.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.750
Oh, well, you know, there were plenty of communists in Paris.

06:05.090 --> 06:07.233
And there were printed tracts, communist tracts.

06:07.593 --> 06:07.833
Here?

06:08.114 --> 06:08.794
Upstairs.

06:09.895 --> 06:16.002
And there's a very funny story that Lucien Chaleur tells.

06:16.822 --> 06:20.346
I mean, during the day, he was a bookseller, usual bookseller.

06:20.933 --> 06:28.703
And he had all these German customers before the war.

06:29.524 --> 06:33.529
And once during the war, and at that time he was a bookseller.

06:33.929 --> 06:38.255
At that time he was a communist, printing trucks, and blowing all this stuff.

06:39.496 --> 06:47.907
And one day, there were steps, which probably loved, printing trucks, and putting them into envelopes and things like that.

06:47.947 --> 06:50.350
That's in 1942, 1943.

06:51.730 --> 06:53.893
And somebody rings at the door.

06:55.955 --> 06:58.138
So he opens the door.

06:58.338 --> 07:02.143
I mean, first they put all the trucks and the table and everything, you know.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.906
And then he goes to the door and he opens it.

07:05.487 --> 07:08.451
And he sees a German officer.

07:10.493 --> 07:12.215
So he thinks, OK, we're all dead.

07:13.237 --> 07:14.438
That's fantastic.

07:15.199 --> 07:16.361
And then he looks at the guy.

07:16.961 --> 07:19.965
And the guy says, hello, Mr. Scheller, how are you?

07:20.232 --> 07:25.958
Because he was the head of the Bayerischer Stadtschidiotek, who used to be a really good friend before the war.

07:26.218 --> 07:29.021
And he was, at that time, a German officer.

07:29.041 --> 07:33.185
And, you know, as he was in Paris during the war, he came to see him.

07:33.906 --> 07:36.068
Wow.

07:36.088 --> 07:41.554
And he was just, so they went, I mean, so they went into the shop, and they looked at the books, and they had a really nice sign.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.817
But, you know, at the same time, he was pretty attractive.

07:44.998 --> 07:45.858
Yes.

07:46.339 --> 07:49.362
That's a fascinating story.

07:50.422 --> 07:51.263
Who bought books?

07:51.343 --> 07:55.407
I mean, were French people buying books during the occupation?

07:56.689 --> 07:57.590
I'm sure, yeah.

07:57.810 --> 08:03.736
Who bought books during the occupation?

08:05.338 --> 08:07.260
The same people.

08:07.280 --> 08:13.246
So, I guess I'm trying to say the love for books seems to transcend all situations.

08:13.266 --> 08:13.947
Is that right?

08:14.467 --> 08:15.749
You were about to say something.

08:15.769 --> 08:16.530
Yeah, I agree.

08:16.810 --> 08:19.753
I mean, that's, I'm sure that, I mean, that's always

08:20.054 --> 08:36.633
I mean, you know, since 1989 in Russia, we discovered that although some books were forbidden, there was always a market for bibliography.

08:37.314 --> 08:38.054
During the war?

08:38.675 --> 08:45.623
During the war, or in the eastern part of Iraq.

08:45.923 --> 08:58.945
1989, since the Berlin Wall fell down, we met some customers, and there was a market at that time, although it was forbidden.

08:58.965 --> 09:05.135
Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there were customers even though it was forbidden.

09:05.456 --> 09:06.437
So how did they do bills?

09:06.477 --> 09:07.319
Did they come here?

09:07.519 --> 09:10.344
They were having business with German dealers.

09:11.245 --> 09:12.387
I see, I see.

09:12.822 --> 09:19.449
How would you describe the kinds of book collectors, the people that you deal with now, if you would describe them?

09:20.470 --> 09:22.532
Established people, older people?

09:22.873 --> 09:23.694
What kind of people?

09:23.734 --> 09:26.637
What do you see in people buying books today?

09:28.419 --> 09:37.969
Do you see a changing with older people, younger people?

09:39.029 --> 09:42.915
I mean, they're always the same.

09:42.935 --> 09:48.663
The thing is that maybe people, I mean, people used to be really good customers without more time.

09:48.683 --> 09:51.307
It's not a customer, it's collector.

09:51.327 --> 09:54.211
Okay, yes, more important.

09:54.411 --> 09:59.479
Older, younger, it's the collector.

10:02.343 --> 10:08.091
Can you describe for me, now you've got four generations, this is amazing, you have four generations of booksellers.

10:08.527 --> 10:19.917
What kinds of things do you bring to the... I mean, there's a European tradition in bookseller, I think, that's kind of remarkable, about understanding the books.

10:20.918 --> 10:24.161
It's not just taking an object and offering it for sale.

10:24.201 --> 10:26.283
I think you have to know... No, that's what my friend would say.

10:26.323 --> 10:28.025
We don't have customers, we have collectors.

10:28.145 --> 10:37.453
And we just... I mean, this is not... I mean, our customers are more friends than...

10:37.602 --> 10:45.153
And it's always been like that in my family, and with Lucien Chelaire, too.

10:45.773 --> 10:50.981
I mean, we've always been really close to the people we sell the books to.

10:51.001 --> 10:55.487
Do you think generational, the collective, is it Lennon family?

10:55.507 --> 10:56.428
Some of them, yes.

10:56.749 --> 10:59.893
Some of them, but not regularly.

10:59.973 --> 11:03.238
So, with Lucien Chelaire,

11:03.573 --> 11:06.878
You say he was a communist during the night and a bookseller during the day.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.061
What kinds of books did he sell, though?

11:09.081 --> 11:10.243
What was his head?

11:10.263 --> 11:19.898
Well, you know, it was, when I say, which means that he was a capitalist during the day.

11:20.299 --> 11:22.742
Oh, that's so funny.

11:22.762 --> 11:23.684
What's the dog's name?

11:24.465 --> 11:24.665
Bazar.

11:25.086 --> 11:25.366
Bazar.

11:25.386 --> 11:26.408
That's my email.

11:27.299 --> 11:29.321
That's the email?

11:29.382 --> 11:32.566
Your email was so close to my email.

11:32.586 --> 11:33.086
I noticed that.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.109
But you know, Bazan is the kind of leather.

11:35.409 --> 11:35.890
Yes.

11:35.910 --> 11:36.470
For bindings.

11:36.490 --> 11:37.311
Bazan is this email.

11:37.411 --> 11:38.753
I didn't understand.

11:38.773 --> 11:39.414
Excuse me, what is it, leather?

11:39.434 --> 11:41.256
It's the special leather for the bindings.

11:41.797 --> 11:44.881
You know, it's, uh, uh, you have the calf.

11:44.921 --> 11:45.582
Yes.

11:45.602 --> 11:45.862
Yes.

11:45.882 --> 11:47.304
But that's the cheap calf.

11:48.325 --> 11:48.425
Okay.

11:48.445 --> 11:51.489
The cheap calf.

11:51.509 --> 11:54.032
It's a bad quality calf for bindings.

11:54.957 --> 11:57.260
And we call it Bazaan.

11:58.321 --> 12:00.123
Bazaan?

12:00.143 --> 12:00.483
Bazaan.

12:00.503 --> 12:03.066
Because, you know, she's a Mongol.

12:03.146 --> 12:05.428
What kind of Mongol?

12:05.529 --> 12:08.252
Maybe before we go take some pictures of father and son.

12:09.032 --> 12:12.316
Could we take some pictures of you before we go through?

12:12.336 --> 12:14.218
You won't, yeah.

12:14.238 --> 12:17.381
So is this, you have more stock?

12:17.462 --> 12:19.944
So here you have the usual stock.

12:21.286 --> 12:24.289
And I will show you in my dad's office.

12:24.488 --> 12:27.611
We have to save with these big, important books.

12:28.692 --> 12:32.936
How large would you say your inventory is approximately?

12:32.956 --> 12:33.517
Some titles?

12:34.038 --> 12:35.399
Yes, numbers actually.

12:36.140 --> 12:45.829
Titles or numbers?

12:45.930 --> 12:49.433
Combien de pitres?

12:53.699 --> 12:59.749
It doesn't matter.

13:10.167 --> 13:16.298
That's about five thousand dollars.

13:16.582 --> 13:24.031
So you actually, do you acquire books and then try and place them with a collector?

13:24.051 --> 13:26.473
And does a collector tell you what he's looking for?

13:26.633 --> 13:26.814
No.

13:27.454 --> 13:39.408
The way we deal is that we buy the books, then we put them on the shelves, and then we wait for the collector to come and enjoy the book with us.

13:40.049 --> 13:42.952
We never make any offers or things like that.

13:43.413 --> 13:43.713
Really?

13:43.873 --> 13:45.475
That's not the way we deal.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.264
Well, that's philosophic, then.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.646
You must be taught your son this.

13:48.687 --> 13:48.947
Yeah.

13:49.468 --> 13:54.195
Well, that's just the way it is.

13:54.515 --> 13:55.657
Well, it's so different.

13:55.777 --> 13:59.944
I talked to some other booksellers, and they have computers.

14:00.024 --> 14:00.985
Yeah, we have a computer.

14:01.025 --> 14:09.859
That's it.

14:11.122 --> 14:13.904
So I'm trying to get a feel for it.

14:13.924 --> 14:18.528
It's a wonderful attitude, don't you think, Corey?

14:18.548 --> 14:21.631
So I think what you're saying is you have a great respect for the book.

14:21.671 --> 14:22.492
You find the book.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.253
Actually, yes.

14:24.273 --> 14:30.598
We never buy a book thinking, well, I'm buying this book to sell it to this guy.

14:31.279 --> 14:32.220
We always buy it.

14:32.260 --> 14:36.223
When we buy a book, we say, that's an interesting book.

14:36.243 --> 14:36.864
We should have it.

14:38.325 --> 14:41.027
And then once we have it, then we

14:41.716 --> 14:44.659
Describe it, write it, and sell it.

14:45.620 --> 14:50.005
But, I mean, where do we find somebody to buy it?

14:50.166 --> 14:55.031
So, what is your philosophy towards the acquisition of books?

14:56.233 --> 15:00.177
How do you decide what books you want and what books you don't want?

15:00.578 --> 15:02.540
It's completely, as you said, subjective.

15:02.820 --> 15:03.521
Totally subjective.

15:03.541 --> 15:04.882
Totally subjective.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.685
It's just our feeling, you know?

15:06.705 --> 15:10.609
We look at the book, and when we think it's an interesting book,

15:11.618 --> 15:29.915
And, you know, I don't think there's... You cannot explain why you think this book is worth having, and then, internally, why it's worth more, too, because, I mean, we're jealous, so, I mean, we have to make money.

15:30.115 --> 15:32.617
But there's not... I mean, we cannot explain.

15:32.657 --> 15:39.043
We don't think that this book... I mean, we just think this book should be ours.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.723
No, that's good.

15:42.743 --> 15:43.364
I like that.

15:43.744 --> 15:48.609
So do you often buy books that you have never seen or heard of before?

15:49.249 --> 15:56.836
Let's say you pick up a book, and it's the first time you've ever heard of this book, and yet you feel that this is a book that you have to have.

15:56.876 --> 15:59.279
Yeah, definitely.

15:59.299 --> 16:08.187
I mean, it happens more often to me than to him.

16:08.302 --> 16:12.446
Tell me, how old are you?

16:13.087 --> 16:14.588
Your age.

16:14.949 --> 16:15.429
I'm 28.

16:15.489 --> 16:18.192
My father is 57.

16:18.973 --> 16:22.456
So, did you study at all?

16:22.997 --> 16:28.622
What did you study to help you become a better... First of all, I grew up with books.

16:28.643 --> 16:33.127
And then I studied... Artistry in Paris.

16:33.728 --> 16:34.669
Where did you go to school?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.591
At Sorbonne.

16:36.611 --> 16:38.072
And Artistry at Oxford.

16:38.626 --> 16:44.073
And I did a little red book school at Columbia with Terry Ballinger.

16:44.093 --> 16:45.596
Terry, yes.

16:45.616 --> 16:48.499
And that's that.

16:48.520 --> 16:54.207
I interviewed Terry for this book.

16:54.227 --> 16:55.048
And daddy.

16:55.068 --> 16:55.569
And daddy.

16:55.589 --> 16:57.352
And family.

16:57.572 --> 16:59.875
Oh, that's wonderful.

17:01.458 --> 17:08.809
Did you know all this while, while you were going to Sorbonne, while you were going to Oxford, while you were going to Columbia, and eventually you would be coming?

17:08.849 --> 17:23.010
I first went to Columbia, and then I went to La Sorbonne, and he managed to figure out that I was more in the shop than at La Sorbonne.

17:26.703 --> 17:29.907
Because he was always asking me, but don't you have any lectures?

17:30.007 --> 17:32.009
I said, yeah, that's fine.

17:32.029 --> 17:33.031
I'm happy at the shop.

17:33.311 --> 17:34.212
What can I do for you?

17:34.232 --> 17:36.435
And we did that for one year.

17:36.475 --> 17:47.829
And after one year, I said, OK, well, I think there's one thing you really have to get is, I mean, you have to speak English.

17:49.030 --> 17:53.976
Once you, I mean, whatever you do, you have to speak English.

17:55.053 --> 17:56.715
And so that's why I went out.

17:56.855 --> 17:58.537
I wish I had better French.

17:58.557 --> 18:05.386
My French is lamentably bad, but thankfully I can at least tell the taxi driver where to take you going.

18:05.466 --> 18:09.832
This is very important.

18:09.852 --> 18:11.234
Do you have children?

18:11.534 --> 18:12.435
No, I live married.

18:13.236 --> 18:15.739
But do you think, you know, should you have children?

18:16.080 --> 18:20.325
Because we're approaching the 21st century now, you know.

18:20.345 --> 18:24.250
You wonder what's going to happen to books.

18:25.664 --> 18:27.787
50 years from now, 100 years from now.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.249
Do you ever think about that?

18:33.675 --> 18:37.620
Well, we always hope that they will be collectors forever.

18:38.862 --> 18:39.483
Oh, great work.

18:40.484 --> 18:43.749
You know, I mean, that's... Why not?

18:45.271 --> 18:53.342
I can see that in time.

18:54.014 --> 18:56.557
Are you familiar with the book that I wrote?

18:56.577 --> 18:58.279
It's called A Gentle Madness.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.945
No, you should have a copy that's too big to carry.

19:03.005 --> 19:06.309
I'll mail you one when we get home, if I may.

19:08.872 --> 19:13.317
My book really is about, it's called A Gentle Madness.

19:14.098 --> 19:17.642
It's about the passion for books.

19:18.363 --> 19:22.468
And this new book is really going to go much longer.

19:22.803 --> 19:30.432
examination of the European attitude, because a lot of booksellers came to the United States in the 30s.

19:30.452 --> 19:40.623
They were Jewish booksellers, and one of the byproducts of that is that they brought this European cultural attitude about the books.

19:40.643 --> 19:46.570
It's not just getting something like this and putting a price on it and putting it out there.

19:47.070 --> 19:48.692
It's like you said, looking at a book

19:48.925 --> 19:52.170
I don't even know what this is yet, but I know it's very important.

19:52.190 --> 19:52.851
There's something in it.

19:53.072 --> 19:54.795
There's something in it, and I have to study it.

19:54.815 --> 19:55.756
I have to understand it.

19:56.277 --> 20:00.824
And then when I understand it, I'm going to share my enthusiasm and my knowledge with somebody else.

20:01.345 --> 20:09.418
And maybe that's simplifying what happens, but I think this kind of attitude is what you have passed on to your son and what your father passed on to you.

20:10.260 --> 20:14.747
And when you said, Sorbald, Oxford, Columbia, and he said, and Daddy.

20:15.065 --> 20:23.596
You know, he was speaking volumes there about... I guess I'm trying to get at this.

20:23.637 --> 20:26.060
I don't know if I'm putting it in the right words here.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.101
No, you're right.

20:27.161 --> 20:28.804
I mean, you're definitely right.

20:29.024 --> 20:35.212
Now, I think... Monsieur Chalet, I understand that he was very helpful, helping people during the war.

20:35.232 --> 20:37.675
Is that correct?

20:37.756 --> 20:39.598
Yeah, he was very active during the war.

20:39.878 --> 20:39.979
Yeah.

20:40.559 --> 20:43.744
Helping people who were... Helping people, fighting people.

20:43.764 --> 20:44.785
Fighting people, yes.

20:45.153 --> 20:47.296
Is there anything you could tell me about that?

20:47.897 --> 21:00.615
I'm going to have a chapter on these émigrés, of these people who escaped, you know, the Nazis.

21:11.030 --> 21:14.755
You know, you knew all these communist people,

21:14.819 --> 21:24.068
I mean, when they were passing through Paris, they would be in a compartment.

21:25.549 --> 21:28.051
He would hide them.

21:28.532 --> 21:31.354
That's what he was doing.

21:31.654 --> 21:33.056
He was not really active.

21:33.136 --> 21:35.258
But he assisted people.

21:35.358 --> 21:39.502
OK, let's wait.

21:40.222 --> 21:43.105
Did you have a question?

21:45.869 --> 21:50.753
Do you have a general clientele?

21:50.954 --> 21:57.780
Are there people who come in that you never see before, or is it largely people you do business with kind of the same?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.942
We usually do people with people we know.

21:59.962 --> 22:00.862
I know people we know.

22:00.883 --> 22:01.843
Yeah.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.925
Ninety percent of the business.

22:03.985 --> 22:15.876
How important is the relationship between the bookseller and the collector, establishing a rapport and understanding and knowing what the individual is trying to accomplish?

22:16.227 --> 22:22.977
How important is the bookseller in developing a collection and building one?

22:22.997 --> 22:24.379
It depends on the collector.

22:25.781 --> 22:39.380
We have one, two, three, two really close friends.

22:39.581 --> 22:46.150
They're really good friends, and they're complete rosters.

22:46.687 --> 22:50.471
really building their collection.

22:50.491 --> 22:59.440
They will always, I mean, when we say you should buy this book, they will buy it.

22:59.460 --> 23:07.788
And now, because they've known my father for almost 20 years now, he doesn't have to say, you have to buy this book.

23:07.808 --> 23:08.569
They just get it.

23:09.790 --> 23:10.411
They understand.

23:10.891 --> 23:15.816
You know, we show them the book, and they just

23:15.982 --> 23:19.006
We don't have to explain to them.

23:19.546 --> 23:24.332
We just talk about the book, and then they live with the book.

23:24.352 --> 23:26.255
Four generations of book selling.

23:26.455 --> 23:28.217
Are any of you collectors yourselves?

23:28.618 --> 23:29.839
Do you collect books yourselves?

23:30.320 --> 23:32.242
My father does, yes.

23:32.262 --> 23:34.104
What kinds of things do you collect?

23:34.665 --> 23:36.688
It's got different collections.

23:36.708 --> 23:44.217
It's got one which is the French writer collects.

23:44.753 --> 23:55.049
Most of the manuscripts in front of hands, first editions, dedication copies, presentation copies, and other things.

23:55.069 --> 23:56.752
So that's his main collection.

23:57.934 --> 24:08.370
And then he also made a collection of guide books, early guides from the 16th to the 19th century.

24:08.390 --> 24:12.837
Early guides, which that's about them.

24:13.880 --> 24:20.767
But this collection, he sold a few years ago.

24:20.947 --> 24:21.588
Oh, he sold it?

24:21.608 --> 24:21.768
Yeah.

24:22.989 --> 24:24.351
So was that hard for you?

24:25.011 --> 24:26.213
Yes.

24:26.233 --> 24:27.334
So why did you do it?

24:28.675 --> 24:34.121
We were buying a house.

24:34.381 --> 24:34.761
Yes.

24:34.821 --> 24:39.786
That's usually the answer.

24:39.886 --> 24:41.668
It was a big, yeah.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.469
A big house.

24:43.073 --> 24:50.364
Did you sell it as a collection or a production?

24:51.045 --> 24:54.130
Oh.

25:02.302 --> 25:07.169
The third collection, yes, that's my favorite.

25:07.290 --> 25:07.630
Which is?

25:08.217 --> 25:11.243
It's a crazy collection.

25:11.564 --> 25:12.245
There's no sense.

25:12.606 --> 25:13.969
No sense.

25:15.211 --> 25:25.071
Every time we buy a collection of books, he keeps the book he prefers in the collection.

25:25.652 --> 25:30.141
It doesn't have to be an expensive book.

25:31.825 --> 25:33.227
You said one book from the collection?

25:33.247 --> 25:34.609
One book from every collection.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.852
Wonderful.

25:37.073 --> 25:44.624
And you know, as we're dealing in medicine, science, incunables, travel, medicine, travel.

25:45.044 --> 25:53.697
So every time we buy a group of books, you know that, it doesn't have to deal with a huge collection, but a group of more than 20 books.

25:53.717 --> 25:54.378
It keeps one.

25:54.778 --> 25:56.741
I mean, it keeps the one he likes best.

25:58.384 --> 25:59.385
Can you explain why?

26:03.517 --> 26:13.953
That's what he called his milestone in his life.

26:13.973 --> 26:22.966
In his life as a bookseller.

26:23.106 --> 26:32.140
And you say it doesn't necessarily have to be the best book in the collection or the most important book.

26:32.474 --> 26:41.324
Something that appeals to you.

26:42.385 --> 26:50.335
How does it appeal to you with the way it looks, the content, the way it feels?

26:50.355 --> 26:55.440
I wish the tape recorder would pick that up.

26:55.460 --> 27:02.008
You know, you've got, for instance, in the collection, you've got

27:02.714 --> 27:06.979
You know Jacques Lacan, the psychoanalyst?

27:07.019 --> 27:07.700
Of course, yes.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.665
So the first edition of his thesis on paranoia.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.889
And this is Salvador Dali's coffee.

27:15.109 --> 27:19.514
Oh, that's right.

27:20.195 --> 27:20.756
Jacques Lacan.

27:21.597 --> 27:22.118
L-E-C-A-N.

27:23.639 --> 27:23.940
C-A-N.

27:28.966 --> 27:31.970
C-A-N.

27:32.150 --> 27:32.350
L-E-C-A-N.

27:33.697 --> 27:36.660
And that's from Paramelia.

27:36.980 --> 27:42.865
And it's described to Santa del Dali, to my good friend, who helped me in writing this book.

27:42.885 --> 27:44.767
Well, that's a very important point.

27:44.787 --> 27:45.868
And you know, that's one book.

27:45.888 --> 27:53.655
But he also has one of the first books written in Holland, the Gouda 1490.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.898
Holland, yes.

27:56.918 --> 27:57.298
Lovely.

27:57.819 --> 28:02.623
It's a lovely book about animals, and it's an illustrious book, a terrible book.

28:02.958 --> 28:08.767
Can you name a few others?

28:10.570 --> 28:12.573
The title of the La Psycose Paranoia.

28:13.435 --> 28:14.156
Yes.

28:14.176 --> 28:17.581
It's about the La Psycose Paranoia.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.185
Yeah, the La Psycose Paranoia.

28:20.245 --> 28:21.708
The Dutch book as well.

28:21.728 --> 28:23.651
It's bringing Gouda.

28:25.013 --> 28:25.894
Gouda.

28:26.495 --> 28:29.300
G-O-U-D-A in 1480.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.822
1480.

28:31.426 --> 28:31.766
Yes.

28:31.846 --> 28:35.050
And that's called .

28:36.171 --> 28:40.917
I might query you on the internet at some point, and maybe you could spell some of these questions?

28:40.937 --> 28:41.357
Yeah, sure.

28:41.437 --> 28:42.539
When I send meetings.

28:42.559 --> 28:46.083
Yeah, well, when you have one of my email, that's no problem.

28:46.103 --> 28:48.365
We'll go over a few of these things.

28:49.487 --> 28:50.388
That's great.

28:50.628 --> 28:51.629
And a few others?

28:51.649 --> 28:53.471
A few of them.

28:55.434 --> 28:58.217
So how many items would you say there are in this collection?

28:58.237 --> 28:58.497
I don't know.

29:00.890 --> 29:08.778
How do you, having in your home, or having in your home, and then how do you show them, how do you organize them?

29:10.640 --> 29:22.453
They're just... I mean, you know, all the collections on one, on two shelves, and the other one, every collection has its shelves.

29:22.473 --> 29:24.075
And how long have you been doing that, sir?

29:25.216 --> 29:26.758
Ah, to do.

29:26.778 --> 29:26.998
To do.

29:27.265 --> 29:35.473
So from the very almost, from the beginning, you buy a collection, acquire a collection.

29:35.493 --> 29:37.175
The first one is a guide.

29:37.895 --> 29:38.256
A guide.

29:39.157 --> 29:44.462
Non, mais de la collection de... You think?

29:44.482 --> 29:53.931
C'est... Je crois que c'est... Avec... Comment... Millian Pleno, avec... Qu'est-ce que tu as gardé, Millian Pleno?

29:54.282 --> 30:11.161
It's got also, yeah, the Lavalier catalog, then contemporary one of Morocco, with the arms of the brother of Madame de Pompadour.

30:11.241 --> 30:13.063
It's wonderful, yeah.

30:16.787 --> 30:19.811
They're all completely different books.

30:19.831 --> 30:21.032
But it makes it a collection.

30:21.535 --> 30:28.363
You see, these books... There's somebody to walk in and look and they say, what is the theme here?

30:28.943 --> 30:34.650
The theme is, it's his life and his life as a bookseller life as a bookseller.

30:34.790 --> 30:37.012
Peut-être je dois écrire.

30:37.032 --> 30:47.284
He writes on the... It's écrit sur les... Sur les... Sur les... Sur les... Mais moi, je devrais le... Je devrais... Comme souvenir, quand même.

30:48.065 --> 30:51.048
Ah, moi, je sais très bien.

30:51.068 --> 30:51.188
Right.

30:51.708 --> 31:13.195
Yeah, and what is going to happen?

31:13.215 --> 31:16.459
You think now Sotheby's and Christie are going to be coming into Paris.

31:16.819 --> 31:19.082
Will that affect

31:21.070 --> 31:22.792
I imagine you're too happy about that.

31:25.396 --> 31:27.119
What can we do, I suppose?

31:27.139 --> 31:37.233
No, but we're not... I mean, you know, we also like to do business and to have something going on in Paris.

31:37.253 --> 31:47.348
And we also think that when Christians and Sotheby's are active in Paris, that can bring new people, and that can make, you know, Paris more active in the book world.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.052
So that can be positive.

31:53.494 --> 32:06.570
But one would hope that you certainly wouldn't want to see people who might otherwise offer their collections to booksellers now consigning them to another house in the hope that they can, you know, reap a windfall, I suppose.

32:08.152 --> 32:08.532
Who knows?

32:09.113 --> 32:13.418
Yes, but you know, they were already in Paris.

32:13.438 --> 32:15.040
They couldn't sell the books in Paris.

32:15.273 --> 32:17.396
But they are opposites in Paris.

32:17.416 --> 32:20.441
And so they could get the books anyway.

32:20.481 --> 32:21.203
That all remains.

32:21.323 --> 32:24.849
That all remains.

32:24.869 --> 32:26.611
And how about your collecting?

32:26.672 --> 32:27.453
Are you doing the same?

32:27.853 --> 32:30.277
I'm not collecting.

32:30.297 --> 32:31.660
I don't collect books.

32:31.900 --> 32:42.377
Actually, I like to... I enjoy keeping... But I cannot call that a collection, because I enjoy keeping for myself a nice book.

32:43.387 --> 32:52.178
just because I find it interesting or, but I don't have any, you know, he always has a sense in his collections.

32:52.198 --> 32:58.486
He always has a goal, I mean, there's something which, he always can explain why he kept this book.

32:59.727 --> 33:04.894
I can't, when I've got, I keep some books for myself, but I cannot, I can explain why.

33:05.414 --> 33:06.436
He's not a collector.

33:06.456 --> 33:09.259
Because I like them, but I'm not a collector.

33:09.695 --> 33:12.819
What's the most important thing he taught you, your father taught you about?

33:13.020 --> 33:14.602
What is the most important thing?

33:15.163 --> 33:16.865
He told me that he taught me.

33:17.406 --> 33:19.408
I don't know.

33:19.428 --> 33:28.461
But he said, and daddy, the most important, maybe what he taught you was the reverence for books, I guess, and that's his totality.

33:30.283 --> 33:33.989
I compare, I mean, I don't ask.

33:34.009 --> 33:36.512
I mean, I'm sure that's the love of books, yeah.

33:36.779 --> 33:47.489
But I just came because, you know, as a kid, you would come home and just tell everybody he's enjoying what he's doing.

33:47.509 --> 33:48.811
And he would show the goods.

33:50.832 --> 33:58.220
At that time, I had it.

33:58.260 --> 33:58.400
Why?

33:58.580 --> 34:01.022
Because when your parents liked something, you had it.

34:02.003 --> 34:04.826
That's why I don't play tennis.

34:04.846 --> 34:06.027
And I wish I did, though.

34:06.428 --> 34:12.535
But you say, you know, collectors, you certainly have a reverence for what the book represents.

34:12.936 --> 34:13.717
Yeah.

34:13.737 --> 34:19.403
But if they collect them... I don't collect them as... You know, I'm not a collector of anything.

34:20.645 --> 34:27.373
I will never collect stamps or glasses or... I'm not a collector.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.236
I just like... I enjoy having nice objects.

34:30.977 --> 34:36.283
So I can keep drawing, painting a book...

34:36.922 --> 34:40.948
You know, a 15th-century glass?

34:45.014 --> 34:46.416
Anything, when I like it.

34:46.716 --> 35:01.438
But that's not being a collector, because I don't want, you know, I'm not going to buy only, to keep only drawings, or to keep only books, or to, I just like nice objects.

35:01.458 --> 35:04.343
Describe, if you would, those large folios up there.

35:05.725 --> 35:06.005
Yeah.

35:06.085 --> 35:06.726
What are those?

35:07.246 --> 35:10.771
That's the first edition we also took over the detail.

35:10.952 --> 35:11.613
Really?

35:13.115 --> 35:13.315
Wow.

35:14.557 --> 35:17.722
How many volumes is that?

35:17.822 --> 35:18.103
25.

35:18.684 --> 35:23.230
And how long have you had that?

35:23.451 --> 35:24.733
A long time?

35:25.214 --> 35:31.083
No, but we always want to have a copy of this.

35:32.685 --> 35:34.027
You always want to have a copy?

35:34.588 --> 35:34.688
Yeah.

35:34.988 --> 35:38.272
We like to have a copy on the shelf at this point.

35:38.292 --> 35:40.134
So you'd be in New York.

35:40.735 --> 35:41.776
This one with a copy.

35:42.397 --> 35:44.700
You know, we always have one or two.

35:45.401 --> 35:47.523
So I don't know when we bought this one.

35:47.884 --> 35:50.467
So if you sold one, you buy it, you'd get another one to buy it.

35:50.487 --> 35:51.568
Maybe you wouldn't sell it.

35:51.708 --> 35:54.752
Would you sell it if you didn't have another one to replace it with?

35:54.772 --> 35:56.334
What if I wanted to buy it right now?

35:56.975 --> 35:59.578
Actually, well, of course.

36:00.065 --> 36:01.747
It's for sale.

36:01.807 --> 36:02.527
It's everything.

36:02.547 --> 36:05.510
I mean, we're in a bookshop, so it's for sale.

36:07.031 --> 36:10.815
You may look for another one afterwards, too.

36:10.835 --> 36:14.999
But this one, actually, it's coming from the restaurant.

36:15.499 --> 36:16.060
Oh, yes.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.702
And it has to be collected and taken care of.

36:19.183 --> 36:23.446
So is that the one set of books that you want to have all the time?

36:23.466 --> 36:24.207
Are there any others?

36:24.708 --> 36:29.532
Well, there are some books that we want to have, yeah.

36:30.102 --> 36:33.246
Describe why that is important.

36:33.307 --> 36:35.590
I've never heard that before.

36:35.650 --> 36:37.132
A bookseller said that before.

36:37.192 --> 36:40.597
I've never heard a bookseller say, you always want to have a certain book.

36:42.199 --> 36:42.840
Why is that?

36:43.461 --> 36:44.322
I think we should write.

36:45.264 --> 36:47.427
I think it's a bit of attitude.

36:47.467 --> 36:56.700
Yeah, because we, you know, when we have somebody coming, I mean, we are specialized in science, medicine, travel,

36:58.908 --> 37:17.416
And so we cannot always have a set of, but we always try to have a set of encyclopedias, a set for science, a set of cook travels for travel, a first edition of Claude Bernard for medicine.

37:18.778 --> 37:27.852
You know, there are like, I don't know, 20 or 30 books, and people know that

37:28.118 --> 37:31.503
When they need one, they just come, and we have one.

37:31.523 --> 37:32.785
I see.

37:32.805 --> 37:33.947
And when was that published?

37:34.027 --> 37:35.509
I think you might have said it, but I didn't.

37:36.430 --> 37:38.633
That's in 70 years.

37:38.653 --> 37:43.941
That's between 70 and 82, or something like that.

37:43.961 --> 37:47.426
So that is one of the first great encyclopedias here, right?

37:48.207 --> 37:54.657
Yeah, this is it.

37:54.677 --> 37:56.860
Yes, I picked it up.

38:00.130 --> 38:16.509
This is good.

38:16.529 --> 38:16.769
I like this.

38:16.789 --> 38:20.514
Come on, let me move the coast for about ten days.

38:20.594 --> 38:24.398
Oh, there's a travel page.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.020
Is that specific?

38:26.185 --> 38:29.989
Yeah, this is all the description of this book.

38:30.009 --> 38:30.930
That's a long title.

38:31.831 --> 38:35.275
IDDRO, 17, is it 17?

38:35.295 --> 38:45.626
Yeah, 17 plus the supplements, plus everything, so that means that it's all because they have some... What's this reference so I can check it when I get this one?

38:45.666 --> 38:48.490
Well, this is an exhibition which was in London.

38:48.650 --> 38:49.451
I have that.

38:49.471 --> 38:50.672
Okay, page 119.

38:50.812 --> 38:51.273
Okay.

38:51.393 --> 38:54.336
I'm thinking in London.

38:56.257 --> 38:58.280
So that's one of the great books.

38:58.300 --> 38:58.420
Yeah.

38:58.940 --> 39:01.183
Great French books we went out.

39:02.865 --> 39:03.146
Uh-huh.

39:03.346 --> 39:06.029
And you have another store, I think, too, right?

39:06.710 --> 39:07.591
You have another store?

39:07.632 --> 39:09.053
Is this the only store that you have?

39:09.113 --> 39:11.076
No, because the other one is my uncle's store.

39:11.156 --> 39:11.516
I see.

39:11.637 --> 39:11.997
Okay.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.761
Because I know... Your father's brother?

39:14.781 --> 39:15.682
My father's brother.

39:16.102 --> 39:16.663
Brother.

39:16.683 --> 39:25.114
And now it's my aunt who is running it because my uncle died last year.

39:25.134 --> 39:25.234
So...

39:25.518 --> 39:29.623
I don't know, the consistency, I guess, to the economy at all.

39:29.643 --> 39:33.148
Someone mentioned there are three million more.

39:33.208 --> 39:36.252
There are three million people in France who are unemployed.

39:36.312 --> 39:43.141
Do you find that that's... Not at this level, I don't think.

39:43.161 --> 39:45.424
We can't feel it.

39:45.444 --> 39:53.635
Occasionally, we have some, you know, in our customers, we have some important people in the industry.

39:53.675 --> 39:55.137
So when there are problems,

39:55.724 --> 39:59.929
and they have less time, and they don't come, but that's no big deal.

40:00.250 --> 40:08.340
That's more their time, they're busy, and they can't come, it's not going to tell you.

40:08.740 --> 40:12.605
Yeah, I think to describe your clientele, it's going to be a higher end.

40:13.466 --> 40:16.510
A more higher end kind of client.

40:17.671 --> 40:19.454
And you don't publish catalogues?

40:20.034 --> 40:22.838
We do, yeah, we do, but not frequently.

40:23.459 --> 40:25.461
We publish only...

40:26.335 --> 40:29.980
We published catalogs on special subjects.

40:30.060 --> 40:38.893
Last year we published a science and medicine catalog, and the year before we published a travel catalog, and the year before we published an incunable catalog, so it depends.

40:39.614 --> 40:43.339
Do you have any incunables here in this shop?

40:43.359 --> 40:44.842
Yeah, sure.

40:44.982 --> 40:45.663
Come in the office.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.288
I'll put my pen away, I promise.

40:52.373 --> 40:53.694
It's very good to use.

40:53.714 --> 40:55.096
This is your office or the office?

40:55.116 --> 40:56.017
This is my dad's office.

40:56.457 --> 40:56.597
Uh-huh.

40:58.359 --> 41:03.023
You know, we're the only... Here, we deal with this kind of looks.

41:03.564 --> 41:07.488
This is the first edition of... the Aldine edition of Cinect.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.128
Oh, that's an album.

41:08.148 --> 41:09.530
And this is Francis III's copy.

41:09.590 --> 41:09.850
Oh.

41:10.190 --> 41:14.094
Oh.

41:14.114 --> 41:15.315
That's in that special, yeah.

41:15.536 --> 41:18.158
No, no, that's just because it was moving in the box.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.081
It's Francis I.

41:22.377 --> 41:23.399
And that's in Aldine.

41:23.859 --> 41:28.988
And this is a manuscript made by Ruslay, who was a calligrapher.

41:29.409 --> 41:42.130
And this was the manuscript which was asked by, when Louis XV married Marie Lepzinska, that's the manuscript he had made for her as a gift for their wedding.

41:42.170 --> 41:43.111
And look at the binding.

41:43.752 --> 41:44.914
Who is the binder on this?

41:44.934 --> 41:45.415
Padlet.

41:45.665 --> 42:15.199
P-I-D-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-U-P P-I-D-L-O-

42:16.107 --> 42:20.193
Yeah, he's 509 years old.

42:20.213 --> 42:21.736
But who did the rebinding on it?

42:21.756 --> 42:23.899
This is an English boy called Francis Burtford.

42:25.362 --> 42:26.924
Whose book played is that?

42:27.084 --> 42:32.092
This one, he was a Belgian collector.

42:32.533 --> 42:39.123
And this is Fairfax Norway?

42:39.504 --> 42:42.088
Oh yes, okay.

42:42.128 --> 42:43.971
They're just coming back from an exhibition.

42:44.828 --> 42:50.675
That you're bringing in children's parents.

42:50.736 --> 42:55.862
They're all in children's parents.

42:55.942 --> 42:59.046
And you had an exhibition?

42:59.066 --> 43:03.432
Yes, we had an exhibition parent.

43:03.632 --> 43:04.213
Very nice.

43:07.617 --> 43:08.719
Do you have cards?

43:09.439 --> 43:10.100
Yeah, sure.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.203
Which are the spellings right of your names.

43:16.908 --> 43:17.669
These are beautiful.

43:21.215 --> 43:23.458
Do you go to any of the book fairs at all?

43:23.498 --> 43:25.481
Yes, we do about four book fairs a year.

43:26.222 --> 43:28.265
We do the California Book Fair.

43:28.285 --> 43:28.726
Oh, you do?

43:28.946 --> 43:33.493
Yeah, the New York Book Fair, the Paris Book Fair, and the Milan Book Fair.

43:33.774 --> 43:39.262
So this is the first edition of Euclid, Venice, 1482, with contemporary binding.

43:39.282 --> 43:41.245
I was going to say, that's a contemporary binding here.

43:44.212 --> 43:45.253
This is called the boss.

43:45.814 --> 43:49.778
The boss is clasps.

43:49.798 --> 43:52.221
That's Euclid.

43:52.241 --> 43:53.362
Oh, look at the type.

43:53.382 --> 43:54.404
Oh, that's exquisite.

43:55.665 --> 43:58.028
And this book was given to a German.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.109
It's a German binding.

43:59.469 --> 44:02.633
Actually, you know, the printer is German in Venice.

44:03.113 --> 44:05.136
And we think that he bought some copy.

44:05.156 --> 44:06.377
And then he went back to Germany.

44:07.518 --> 44:11.603
And so he must have brought some unbound copies.

44:11.937 --> 44:13.319
Because it's a German binding.

44:13.339 --> 44:15.522
So he brought back to Germany.

44:15.862 --> 44:18.325
And the book was given to these men.

44:18.385 --> 44:19.386
I couldn't find who he was.

44:19.827 --> 44:23.452
It's in magnificent condition.

44:23.592 --> 44:24.213
Yeah.

44:24.233 --> 44:25.094
There's no fox.

44:25.194 --> 44:26.415
Very little.

44:26.816 --> 44:27.997
For all those years.

44:28.738 --> 44:31.101
The paper was so good, wasn't it?

44:31.742 --> 44:31.902
Yeah.

44:31.942 --> 44:36.288
Oh, Connie, look at this.

44:38.451 --> 44:39.953
Could you describe that for us?

44:40.914 --> 44:41.775
So this is...

44:42.008 --> 44:43.790
Book of Sowers.

44:47.394 --> 44:53.200
Made in the north of France.

44:57.664 --> 45:04.191
French.

45:04.271 --> 45:08.516
We.

45:09.677 --> 45:09.957
We.

45:10.679 --> 45:29.629
It's what we call canto bourgeois, so that's Flanders.

45:29.650 --> 45:36.180
It's called Simon Marmion.

45:37.072 --> 45:38.954
But we don't know the artist.

45:39.074 --> 45:44.440
This is one of the first reproducers of tennis in the borders.

45:44.460 --> 45:50.427
You see, they have... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:50.647 --> 45:53.050
Yeah, on gold.

45:53.350 --> 45:59.177
That would make it... We have a wide audience of collectors that might be interested in this.

45:59.197 --> 46:00.178
Look at the flowers.

46:00.738 --> 46:01.779
That is magnificent.

46:01.900 --> 46:03.261
And their game.

46:04.102 --> 46:05.003
Yeah, all the games.

46:05.337 --> 46:07.801
That's golf, you see?

46:08.401 --> 46:09.363
In 1510.

46:09.383 --> 46:12.287
Isn't that something?

46:12.307 --> 46:14.871
Is that unusual for Book of Hours to have games?

46:14.891 --> 46:16.293
These kind of things, yeah.

46:16.413 --> 46:20.799
The borders are really extraordinary in this one.

46:20.819 --> 46:23.403
And it hasn't, thank God, it hasn't been trimmed or anything.

46:24.044 --> 46:24.885
It's just perfect.

46:26.027 --> 46:26.447
Wonderful.

46:26.627 --> 46:27.228
Quite beautiful.

46:27.929 --> 46:31.274
So I know you don't collect, but what do you feel when you hold something like that?

46:33.898 --> 46:34.078
Oh,

46:35.560 --> 46:36.421
I enjoy having it.

46:36.741 --> 46:38.684
But this is not exactly my color.

46:38.784 --> 46:43.309
I mean, I won't be sad when I sell it.

46:46.232 --> 46:46.733
It's business.

46:47.293 --> 46:48.454
That's business, yes.

46:51.938 --> 46:52.899
This is the office.

46:57.465 --> 47:00.488
What was the name of the author?

47:01.767 --> 47:04.510
who lived upstairs during the occupation again.

47:04.530 --> 47:06.193
The writer was called Edouard.

47:06.493 --> 47:07.434
Paul Edouard.

47:07.574 --> 47:07.815
Edouard.

47:07.835 --> 47:10.037
Edouard.

47:10.298 --> 47:10.798
Edouard.

47:10.818 --> 47:11.539
Edouard.

47:11.559 --> 47:11.800
Edouard.

47:11.820 --> 47:12.340
Edouard.

47:12.360 --> 47:12.540
Edouard.

47:12.560 --> 47:12.781
Edouard.

47:12.801 --> 47:13.001
Edouard.

47:13.021 --> 47:13.181
Edouard.

47:13.201 --> 47:13.401
Edouard.

47:13.422 --> 47:13.682
Edouard.

47:13.702 --> 47:13.942
Edouard.

47:13.962 --> 47:14.122
Edouard.

47:14.142 --> 47:14.303
Edouard.

47:14.703 --> 47:14.863
Edouard.

47:14.883 --> 47:15.044
Edouard.

47:15.064 --> 47:15.224
Edouard.

47:15.244 --> 47:15.404
Edouard.

47:15.424 --> 47:15.584
Edouard.

47:15.604 --> 47:15.764
Edouard.

47:15.784 --> 47:15.945
Edouard.

47:15.965 --> 47:16.125
Edouard.

47:16.145 --> 47:16.545
Edouard.

47:16.565 --> 47:16.726
Edouard.

47:16.746 --> 47:16.906
Edouard.

47:16.926 --> 47:17.086
Edouard.

47:17.106 --> 47:17.266
Edouard.

47:17.286 --> 47:17.447
Edouard.

47:17.467 --> 47:17.627
Edouard.

47:17.647 --> 47:17.807
Edouard.

47:17.827 --> 47:17.987
Edouard.

47:18.007 --> 47:18.167
Edouard.

47:18.187 --> 47:18.348
Edouard.

47:18.368 --> 47:18.528
Edouard.

47:18.548 --> 47:18.748
Edouard.

47:18.768 --> 47:18.948
Edouard.

47:19.008 --> 47:19.169
Edouard.

47:19.189 --> 47:19.349
Edouard.

47:19.369 --> 47:19.529
Edouard.

47:19.629 --> 47:19.809
Edouard.

47:19.830 --> 47:19.990
Edouard.

47:20.010 --> 47:20.170
Edouard.

47:20.190 --> 47:20.350
Edouard.

47:20.370 --> 47:20.530
Edouard.

47:20.811 --> 47:20.971
Edouard.

47:20.991 --> 47:21.151
Edouard.

47:21.171 --> 47:21.331
Edouard.

47:21.351 --> 47:21.512
Edouard.

47:21.532 --> 47:21.692
Edouard.

47:21.712 --> 47:21.852
Edouard

47:23.772 --> 47:26.536
So most of the stock is here, though, that you have.

47:26.736 --> 47:29.980
Most of the stock available is in this site.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.602
For the expensive booth, yeah.

47:31.682 --> 47:36.609
Kai, do you have any other questions, I think?

47:36.629 --> 47:51.468
Can we take some pictures, do you mind?

47:51.489 --> 47:51.549
No.

47:51.569 --> 47:51.909
Twenty years ago.

47:51.929 --> 47:52.109
Oh, good.

47:52.129 --> 47:53.391
This is wonderful.

47:54.181 --> 47:55.623
That's in there.

47:55.643 --> 47:56.344
That's here.

47:56.364 --> 48:01.070
Yes, before we read everything we've done.

48:01.090 --> 48:02.612
Two handsome men.

48:02.632 --> 48:05.757
How about different places?

48:05.817 --> 48:07.359
I'm going to take a few.

48:08.380 --> 48:13.207
I really like this generational thing a lot.

48:13.247 --> 48:15.029
Maybe your son's standing behind you.

48:17.533 --> 48:19.395
Yeah.

48:24.100 --> 48:28.806
Let's see up there, on the end of this.

48:28.826 --> 48:30.769
From the end of this manuscript.

48:30.789 --> 48:33.953
Oh, that's a beautiful, I think this will be like this piece of paper.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.175
I like this one.

48:36.336 --> 48:39.460
I like this one.

48:39.480 --> 48:40.000
I like this one.

48:40.020 --> 48:40.761
I like this one.

48:41.002 --> 48:41.342
I like this one.

48:41.362 --> 48:41.903
I like this one.

48:41.923 --> 48:42.403
I like this one.

48:42.424 --> 48:46.949
I like this one.

48:46.969 --> 48:47.430
I like this one.

48:47.450 --> 48:49.873
I like this one.

48:49.893 --> 48:50.614
I like this one.

48:51.505 --> 48:55.572
Maybe you can stand there a little bit.

48:55.752 --> 48:59.579
It's the same as Lucia.

48:59.599 --> 49:08.354
It's the same as Lucia.

49:08.374 --> 49:13.542
It's the same as Lucia.

49:13.562 --> 49:15.606
It's the same as Lucia.

49:15.626 --> 49:16.888
It's the same as Lucia.

49:18.455 --> 49:35.241
If you could just book up a bit to me.

49:35.822 --> 49:40.649
Oh yeah, let's do it again.

49:42.452 --> 49:44.195
Once again.

49:44.215 --> 49:44.395
Let's go.

49:45.134 --> 49:49.525
Did you want to get any in the office?

49:49.906 --> 49:56.463
You never know how the lighting will be, and that would be sure to get at least one picture.

49:56.483 --> 50:02.518
It would be terrible.

51:13.677 --> 51:33.116
Oh my God.

51:41.544 --> 51:42.925
You hold this.

51:43.630 --> 51:45.974
That's perfect.

51:45.994 --> 51:49.040
You said it's essential to know English.

51:49.120 --> 51:49.801
Why is that?

51:50.002 --> 51:50.623
Sorry?

51:50.643 --> 51:52.887
You said it's essential to know how to speak English.

51:52.987 --> 51:53.588
Why is that?

51:53.688 --> 51:56.494
Why?

51:56.914 --> 52:01.803
Because we have quite a lot of foreign customers, too.

52:01.943 --> 52:07.714
And we deal with... We deal with foreign customers.

52:07.694 --> 52:13.602
Then you get everything about Bessin in your machine.

52:13.762 --> 52:16.105
He's barking at a customer.

52:16.265 --> 52:31.305
And that's because we deal a lot with, you know, in America, in England, in Italy, in Germany, and that's the international language.

52:31.606 --> 52:36.454
You know, you come with speaking English.

52:36.494 --> 52:38.417
Thank you.

52:39.278 --> 52:46.510
Ted Turner had a program about dogs about five, six years ago.

52:46.670 --> 52:47.932
European dogs.

52:48.713 --> 52:54.222
And so the first one was dogs in Scotland.

52:54.505 --> 53:02.755
with the sheep and everything, and the part about the French dogs were the dogs in the bars, in the distros.

53:03.496 --> 53:14.809
And so the man was, I mean, the producer, when they came to France, they were in the neighborhood, and they went to a restaurant, and they said, well, we're looking for funny dogs.

53:14.889 --> 53:15.670
Do you know any?

53:16.004 --> 53:20.531
And the people there at the restaurant said, oh, Bazan, of course.

53:20.551 --> 53:27.402
So the man called me and went to the restaurant, and Bazan wasn't TV in America because of that.

53:28.624 --> 53:30.067
She is a star.

53:30.247 --> 53:30.688
I know.

53:30.708 --> 53:33.953
She is, and she's already had TV experience.

53:33.973 --> 53:35.475
Stefan, you were going to give us your card?

53:35.495 --> 53:35.976
Yes, sure.

53:36.397 --> 53:36.477
Yes.
