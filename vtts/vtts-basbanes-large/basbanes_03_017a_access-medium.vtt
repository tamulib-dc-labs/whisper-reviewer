WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:03.964
Can we pronounce your name, Kate?

00:04.325 --> 00:04.745
Pocock.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.146
Pocock, okay, very good.

00:06.787 --> 00:08.589
So tell me a little bit, how long have you been?

00:09.169 --> 00:11.952
I joined in 89, in July 89.

00:11.972 --> 00:13.434
Wow, so you have an overview.

00:13.674 --> 00:14.675
I have an overview, yes.

00:14.735 --> 00:28.468
I've been here for, I mean, it still feels as if I haven't really been here all that long, because as they know the publishing house, things change a lot with the books, and the seasons, the seasons change with the books, so one feels as if you're doing something new, everything.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.190
So when you came in, they were,

00:31.570 --> 00:33.253
It was doing pretty well.

00:33.313 --> 00:37.341
John Nichol had been there for a long time.

00:38.043 --> 00:40.648
So he had already done his miracle worker job.

00:40.668 --> 00:42.471
He'd done his miracle worker job, yes.

00:42.491 --> 00:49.545
You know, it's really quite extraordinary that the Yale University Press

00:50.352 --> 00:53.116
has a genuine UK division.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.378
Yes, we do, yes.

00:54.398 --> 00:57.303
I think we're still the only really genuine.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.666
I mean, they have basically sales offices or something like that.

00:59.686 --> 01:00.688
Sales and distribution and marketing.

01:00.708 --> 01:06.517
And it gives them an excuse to put London on their copyright pages, you know, like University of California and the others.

01:06.537 --> 01:06.737
Exactly.

01:07.238 --> 01:10.002
Princeton now has an office in Oxfordshire, but it's tiny.

01:10.443 --> 01:10.763
It's very small.

01:10.783 --> 01:11.805
It's an editorial office?

01:11.825 --> 01:12.646
Editorial office, yes.

01:12.686 --> 01:15.330
I mean, they're bringing in, I don't know, 10 books a year.

01:15.614 --> 01:19.240
So when you came in, how many titles are you in here?

01:19.260 --> 01:24.388
Well, I actually got the catalogue out, because I just wanted to be reminded of what we were doing at that time.

01:24.408 --> 01:28.154
This is the first catalogue, and that was the catalogue then, which was very small.

01:28.214 --> 01:28.775
When you came?

01:29.015 --> 01:31.159
When I came, and this is our latest catalogue.

01:32.220 --> 01:33.302
And you'll see that it's...

01:33.485 --> 01:35.367
Now this is, when you say ours, you mean?

01:35.647 --> 01:36.428
That's everything.

01:36.448 --> 01:38.730
That's both London and the American office.

01:38.750 --> 01:39.811
And that New Haven, right?

01:39.831 --> 01:41.933
But you'll see that it's thin.

01:41.953 --> 01:48.260
I think we were probably only doing about perhaps 40 books at that time in the London office, and now we're doing double that.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.123
So this is, is this just London, or is this London?

01:51.143 --> 01:52.244
No, that's everything.

01:52.424 --> 01:54.866
A Yale book is a Yale book wherever it's published, basically.

01:54.886 --> 01:56.508
But this is a pretty small list.

01:56.588 --> 01:59.351
It's a small list, and here's the equivalent.

01:59.371 --> 01:59.831
Which I've seen.

01:59.871 --> 02:01.193
You've seen that, yes.

02:01.273 --> 02:02.534
So that's much, much bigger.

02:02.614 --> 02:03.475
This is amazing.

02:03.708 --> 02:28.315
and so to look at this we have to be really sophisticated to know what's a London yes you wouldn't you wouldn't know unless I told you I don't think you would know I mean we tend in the London office because the London books are by their own nature books that we think are going to have a trade market and that's really our sort of that's our operating mission over here is to produce more trade books than monographs we

02:28.463 --> 02:53.273
tend to put them at the front because this is not just uh this is not just for librarians and academics. This is for the trade too. So the books at the front are on the whole London. So we you see yourself as a trade publisher basically? On the whole it's although we don't really fit in. We don't quite fit in. I mean we have fitted in with um with the Ernst Gombrich book we've just done. I don't know whether you know about that. No. It's a wonderful book. It's um a book that yeah Ernst Gombrich

02:53.489 --> 03:00.737
wrote when he was a young man for Walter Neurath, who was then, before he'd started Tempton Hudson over here, before the war.

03:01.377 --> 03:08.325
And he was asked by Neurath to look at a small book for children, a history of the world for children.

03:08.445 --> 03:09.226
You know that.

03:09.766 --> 03:11.468
And he looked at it, and he said, this is rubbish.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.150
That's an extraordinary book.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.872
He looked at it and said, this is rubbish, I could do better.

03:14.892 --> 03:17.174
And he said, well, you can do it in three weeks, it's yours.

03:17.494 --> 03:19.877
And he did it in three weeks, and of course it's a gem.

03:20.277 --> 03:22.720
This book has really generated a lot of

03:22.919 --> 03:24.882
Yes, yes, yes.

03:24.902 --> 03:25.583
And it's wonderful.

03:25.723 --> 03:29.629
It's a wonderful book, and we've sold huge quantities of it.

03:29.729 --> 03:32.874
I mean, we've done more than I ever remember doing for a year.

03:32.894 --> 03:41.147
So as a sales and a marketing person, when you get a book like that... Not very often, but it's a journal.

03:41.363 --> 03:44.347
Well, we worked very hard to plan how that was going to work.

03:44.388 --> 03:46.451
How it was going to look was terribly important.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.754
But did you have this buzz before you?

03:48.774 --> 03:49.014
Oh, yes.

03:49.035 --> 03:50.677
I mean, with a name like Gombrich.

03:50.717 --> 03:52.380
With a name like Gombrich, you're bound to.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.045
And what we were worried about was that it would be seen as a children's book.

03:56.586 --> 03:59.330
And as that, it would be seen as very old-fashioned.

03:59.350 --> 04:00.592
Because it's not up-to-date.

04:00.612 --> 04:02.254
I mean, there's no doubt it's not an up-to-date book.

04:02.274 --> 04:08.063
So we were looking very carefully about how to market that and how to make it look like a young...

04:08.212 --> 04:10.335
a book for young people, but not limited to that.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.219
So it's production as much as it is marketing?

04:13.279 --> 04:16.443
The marketing department was really involved in the production of that book.

04:16.864 --> 04:20.850
And I think that the edition that you did here is somewhat different.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.533
It's slightly different.

04:24.214 --> 04:25.656
It's got end papers.

04:25.696 --> 04:28.380
It's got slightly better quality paper.

04:28.799 --> 04:58.418
and the jacket is slightly different, slightly yellower. And why do you think that was necessary? Um I think we wanted to make it look like a really class act and um perhaps the u.s office, I mean it was printed separately, they chose to do it in that way. It's done equally I mean it was done you know just as well there, so they obviously made the right decision too. Um but it was a joy. Does that happen often where the same book is done differently? Yes uh not not it happened more funnily enough when I first arrived

04:58.904 --> 05:06.012
When, particularly a book by Girard, for instance, we did, the Americans decided they didn't mark our jacket at all, so they did a different jacket.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.854
And the book was the same, but they did a different jacket.

05:08.255 --> 05:10.077
And this is the first book or the second one?

05:10.097 --> 05:16.684
Oh, no, this is probably all about the fifth or sixth book, when I first arrived, and it was about country towns.

05:16.724 --> 05:21.810
And we did a market scene.

05:22.190 --> 05:24.473
The Americans didn't like that, so they did their own jacket.

05:25.027 --> 05:29.732
It means that you can't swap stock around quite so, you know, it's not quite so easy to swap around.

05:29.753 --> 05:32.516
So would the book itself have been printed in the same place?

05:32.536 --> 05:34.098
Yes, yes, just different jackets.

05:34.118 --> 05:39.564
But now this one we were just talking about, that was... That was printed in the UK and in the States.

05:39.584 --> 05:42.447
This photography is different, even the layers of... Oh, I don't think so.

05:42.607 --> 05:43.949
I don't think so.

05:44.670 --> 05:45.711
No, I think it's the same.

05:45.731 --> 05:48.074
We used the same disc in both countries.

05:48.094 --> 05:49.135
But it's just different paper.

05:49.195 --> 05:49.756
Different paper.

05:49.936 --> 05:51.718
It's the production rather than the design.

05:52.159 --> 05:53.380
It's a tiny bit different, I think.

05:54.912 --> 06:01.939
But that sort of book doesn't come across, we don't come across it very often, but when we do, it's wonderful to do it.

06:02.540 --> 06:11.148
So, you know, it's kind of interesting to be writing a story about a university press, but which regards itself as a business operation.

06:11.168 --> 06:17.154
Yes, we have to, yeah, we have to, you know, we have to stand up, we have to be self-sufficient.

06:17.975 --> 06:19.156
We can't call on the U.S.

06:19.176 --> 06:21.038
office to prop us up.

06:21.271 --> 06:24.915
And do you think that's kind of the marching orders from the U.S.

06:24.975 --> 06:25.316
as well?

06:25.996 --> 06:26.457
I think so.

06:26.497 --> 06:35.908
I think they, you know, they, perhaps I wouldn't say this to Tom Donatish, but on the whole, we are left to get on with it by ourselves because we can do it.

06:36.048 --> 06:43.957
And, of course, the editorial department here is providing books that sell extremely well in the States for the American office as well as for here.

06:43.977 --> 06:49.523
So, you know, the American office is pleased to have those books too.

06:50.549 --> 06:58.927
So when you have a book and you develop a strategy, you would do it perhaps the same way that a trade house would?

06:58.947 --> 06:59.167
Yes.

06:59.187 --> 06:59.788
Oh, absolutely.

06:59.808 --> 07:01.612
I mean, I came from a trade background.

07:01.652 --> 07:05.100
I mean, I started at Oxford University first, but as a very junior here.

07:05.120 --> 07:11.072
And then I learned a bit about publishing then, but then I worked for a long time for a trade house.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.181
Which was?

07:12.421 --> 07:13.842
Gollants, Victor Gollants.

07:13.862 --> 07:22.270
And when it was, I mean, luckily for me, when it was bought for the first time by Hogan Mifflin, John Nickell approached me and asked me to come here.

07:22.290 --> 07:24.533
So it was thrilling, you know, just wonderful.

07:24.553 --> 07:27.215
So John pretty much put together his team here, didn't he?

07:27.235 --> 07:27.876
Oh, yes, he did.

07:27.896 --> 07:29.277
Oh, absolutely, yes, he did, yes.

07:30.258 --> 07:30.599
He did.

07:30.759 --> 07:33.221
And it's grown quite a lot since I joined.

07:33.862 --> 07:36.544
He is quite an individual.

07:36.865 --> 07:37.565
Oh, yes, he is.

07:37.746 --> 07:38.907
Yes, he's terrific.

07:39.027 --> 07:41.329
John Wyden...

07:41.731 --> 07:44.974
You know, he just credits him with... Oh, he's terrific.

07:44.994 --> 07:50.059
The phrase he used is that this was the cash cow.

07:50.579 --> 07:51.120
Yeah.

07:51.140 --> 07:51.700
Those were his words.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.261
He used that, did he?

07:52.361 --> 07:53.362
Yes, that's good.

07:54.283 --> 07:57.265
And I mentioned that to John Nickel today, and he said, did he say that?

07:57.305 --> 07:58.086
Yeah, exactly.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.467
I would have asked him.

07:59.487 --> 08:00.288
He never said that at the time.

08:00.308 --> 08:02.590
He said, because they never said it back then.

08:02.610 --> 08:03.991
No, he never said it at the time.

08:05.112 --> 08:11.198
So you got here, even after this explosion in extraordinary art books,

08:11.583 --> 08:16.368
When I joined Yale, all I knew it for was for the art books.

08:16.589 --> 08:17.950
And that's amazing.

08:17.970 --> 08:22.575
And I've been reviewing books since the 70s.

08:24.217 --> 08:37.592
And one of the reasons I said, yeah, sure, when I was invited to do this project is the great respect and admiration for these books that nobody else even comes close to doing.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.695
And it's...

08:40.962 --> 08:44.426
Not necessarily what you'd expect to be in a purview of a university, right?

08:44.446 --> 08:45.748
No, no, no, exactly.

08:45.788 --> 08:49.993
Gorgeously, and I hesitate to call them commercial because of the scholarship and so on.

08:50.013 --> 08:50.874
Oh, yes, that's right, yes.

08:50.934 --> 08:52.336
But they're exquisite books.

08:52.356 --> 08:53.377
Yes, they are exquisite.

08:53.397 --> 08:57.582
That has really great substance to them as well.

08:57.803 --> 08:58.083
Yes.

08:58.664 --> 09:08.556
When you talk to Gillian, you will... I mean, Gillian Malpass really has taken the John Nicol baton on, as far as Yale Art books are concerned.

09:08.975 --> 09:11.658
and with our colleague Sally Salverson, who looks after.

09:11.678 --> 09:14.281
I don't know whether John talked about the Pelican history of art.

09:14.662 --> 09:15.202
He didn't.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.445
Ah, well, I must tell you a bit about that.

09:17.625 --> 09:28.478
Well, shortly after I joined, it was clear that Penguin was really not doing much with the Pelican history of art, which was started, incidentally, by Gombrich, by Ernst Gombrich.

09:28.498 --> 09:31.642
So we were able to buy it from them.

09:33.284 --> 09:37.308
And at the time, both John and I said, it would be really great to get Pebsner.

09:37.329 --> 09:38.610
I mean, Pebsner in this country is...

09:39.215 --> 09:40.477
Just such a name.

09:40.857 --> 09:41.779
The Pebsner List.

09:41.799 --> 09:43.101
Oh, I see.

09:43.141 --> 09:44.042
Do you know the list?

09:44.122 --> 09:44.703
No, I don't.

09:44.723 --> 09:45.344
I'll show you one.

09:45.645 --> 09:50.873
It is basically, Pebsner came over from... How do you spell?

09:52.475 --> 09:53.076
P-E-B-S-N-E-R.

09:55.039 --> 10:05.515
And he decided that he was going to describe every notable building in the Great British Islands.

10:05.555 --> 10:07.057
Sure went to Pebsner.

10:07.077 --> 10:07.197
Yes.

10:08.392 --> 10:15.521
And he started this series for Penguin in the, I think it was probably about the 30s or 40s.

10:16.602 --> 10:33.563
Anyway, when he came, I mean, he was a refugee, he came over and started this, as so many people in British publishing did, and I guess American publishing too, but, you know, British publishing would be very impoverished without the huge influx of German publishers.

10:34.545 --> 10:34.905
So...

10:35.628 --> 11:04.774
both John and I thought this would be so wonderful to get our hands on this series from Penguin who weren't really doing much I did at the time so we worked and worked and worked with it and eventually of course we got it and it's a huge success now of course this list doesn't do anything really in the States but here it is the foot in the door for trade for us for our reps going into trade bookshops it absolutely is when you go into a bookshop in any county in any town the first thing you look for is the local person if they haven't got it

11:04.957 --> 11:05.878
They're not a good bookshop.

11:05.898 --> 11:06.679
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.964
So do you call these travel books?

11:10.004 --> 11:12.107
Well, they're guidebooks, basically.

11:12.147 --> 11:12.667
They're guidebooks.

11:12.908 --> 11:13.468
They're guidebooks.

11:13.829 --> 11:14.710
But they're more than that.

11:14.730 --> 11:22.020
They are, you know, they're very much on the Yale, you know, in the Yale model, really.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.782
Is that what it's called, the Buildings of England?

11:23.802 --> 11:25.244
Buildings of England, yes.

11:25.264 --> 11:25.965
Buildings of Britain.

11:26.045 --> 11:27.427
Buildings of England, that one is, yes.

11:29.009 --> 11:31.613
And before you go, I'll give you a list of all of them.

11:31.633 --> 11:31.893
Oh, great.

11:31.913 --> 11:32.794
Yeah, let me do it.

11:32.854 --> 11:33.495
With a poster.

11:34.538 --> 11:36.821
And we do about, you know, four a year.

11:36.921 --> 11:38.002
New ones are there?

11:38.302 --> 11:38.883
Yes, new ones.

11:38.903 --> 11:45.710
It's like painting the full fridge, you know, you finish one, and then new buildings have been built, and old ones have been knocked down, so you have to start all over again.

11:46.051 --> 11:47.312
So do they revise them?

11:47.593 --> 11:48.554
Yes, they do, yes.

11:51.717 --> 11:53.159
Well, that's quite interesting.

11:53.199 --> 11:55.081
How many university professors do something like that?

11:55.101 --> 11:56.222
I don't know, I don't think they do.

11:56.242 --> 11:58.324
I don't think they do.

11:58.765 --> 11:59.826
Strictly the UK?

12:00.126 --> 12:01.508
Strictly the UK, yes, yes.

12:01.690 --> 12:31.393
There are no Buildings of Italy or anything? No we do that in different ways, but not in not in this I mean it's obsessional really. It's every building you know you we've got one of London too of course. And so one person did that? One person, well he didn't, he had an army of funds of uh of help those of course. Really I think he's rude he's rude about buildings you know he's not he's not polite about them. And he's still alive? No he died several. He died in the early 70s so

12:32.032 --> 12:37.899
So the new team who work in this building are carrying on the world.

12:37.919 --> 12:38.900
They still keep his name.

12:38.920 --> 12:45.809
They keep his name because it's such a... People will, you know, if you... It's like Dr. Spock's Guide to... Exactly.

12:45.829 --> 12:45.989
Exactly.

12:46.009 --> 12:46.830
That's right.

12:46.850 --> 12:52.878
But if you, you know, it's very often you'll open a book like the Emma Keown book, Saturday.

12:53.999 --> 12:54.900
One of the...

12:55.167 --> 12:59.394
the characters in that mentions the fact that the book, that their building is in their home.

12:59.454 --> 13:00.515
Well I haven't read it yet.

13:00.535 --> 13:01.056
I well do.

13:01.196 --> 13:04.301
I think it's that one, but certainly an Ian McEwan book.

13:05.223 --> 13:09.149
It makes sense, because he would have that kind of... Exactly, that sort of locality.

13:09.169 --> 13:10.030
Yeah, exactly.

13:10.050 --> 13:10.631
Which he always does.

13:10.831 --> 13:11.432
That's right.

13:11.472 --> 13:13.856
You know, given a good kit in Pesna, he'd say.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.178
I mean, just words like Pesna.

13:15.399 --> 13:21.148
And sometimes when an estate agent, a real estate agent, is selling a book, it will say, mentioned in Pesna.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.069
Really?

13:22.555 --> 13:41.053
They've been a lot around you say since like a. Long time since the 30s and 40s. Yeah really. Yeah and and you'll give me a list of. I will give you a list before you go. So what do you think that I need to know about the London? Well I wanted to tell you I mean you've heard from John I mean that will be the definitive story of this office

13:41.827 --> 13:44.030
And I got two hours of him on tape.

13:44.050 --> 13:45.192
Good, good, good.

13:45.413 --> 13:48.457
What I wanted to tell you about was... And excuse me if I seem a little loopy.

13:48.477 --> 13:49.299
No, not at all.

13:49.319 --> 13:49.699
You're not.

13:49.719 --> 13:52.103
And if we follow up at some point... Absolutely.

13:52.143 --> 13:53.645
I'll think of other things, I'm sure.

13:54.286 --> 13:59.474
If I seem like I'm not asking intelligent questions, forgive me.

13:59.775 --> 14:01.738
You're asking intelligent questions.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.282
Which is why I'm kind of throwing the ball to you right now.

14:04.502 --> 14:05.083
Yes, okay.

14:05.123 --> 14:08.408
What I wanted to tell you about was something that we do...

14:08.928 --> 14:10.389
Well, you know about the publishing.

14:10.409 --> 14:16.575
You've heard from Robert and from John, and you'll hear from Gillian about particularly the art list, which is so crucially important for us.

14:17.876 --> 14:36.792
But what we have done here and what we started, I suppose, after I'd been here about a year and a half, when I first joined here, we were represented in the trade by a group of freelance group, basically, which was just a group of salaried reps.

14:36.872 --> 14:37.753
And this worried me.

14:38.172 --> 14:44.802
I felt sure that if we really wanted to be taken seriously in the British book trade, we should have our own representatives.

14:46.043 --> 14:49.448
And we talked about this internally, about how we could do this.

14:49.468 --> 15:00.965
We clearly didn't have the sort of turnover which would allow us to have the sort of coverage that we had with the five reps who were carrying our list as well as many others.

15:01.466 --> 15:07.234
So then what we decided to do was to buy the little company who were carrying our books.

15:07.805 --> 15:10.087
And with it, we brought in... What was the name of the company?

15:10.107 --> 15:11.188
It was called Ken Dickson.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.652
D-I-C-K-S-O-N.

15:16.013 --> 15:17.674
So it was named after a person.

15:17.714 --> 15:18.455
Named after a person.

15:18.795 --> 15:20.076
Ken was coming up for retirement.

15:20.717 --> 15:27.563
And the largest list that they carried was Taylor & Francis, which, of course, has been bought and has grown so many times since then.

15:27.804 --> 15:29.465
And he was just about to lose that list.

15:29.505 --> 15:32.668
So for him, it was a crucial time.

15:32.688 --> 15:36.732
And when we talked about it, we suddenly realised there's this thing to do, to buy this little company.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.052
which we did for a pound.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.435
And we bought one for one pound.

15:41.495 --> 15:49.224
I mean, you can't really buy something which is not tenable, you know, it's not... There's no infrastructure.

15:49.244 --> 15:50.245
No, exactly.

15:50.265 --> 15:51.447
There's goodwill, maybe.

15:51.467 --> 15:51.747
Exactly.

15:51.787 --> 15:52.508
Goodwill, we hope.

15:52.728 --> 15:55.532
And we thought... And a client list, maybe.

15:55.552 --> 15:56.092
Exactly, maybe.

15:56.112 --> 15:59.997
But they might have decided, oh, we don't want to be owned by Yale University Press.

16:00.378 --> 16:02.060
Anyway, we call it Yale Representation.

16:02.881 --> 16:05.824
And now we have...

16:06.715 --> 16:35.457
four representatives two of them were with us when we took the list over in probably 83 93 and we represent a number of other publishers to the trade and it's terrific because it brings in turnover for us the reps are salaried members of staff of Yale representation which is in turn owned by Yale University Press and we get huge coverage because the

16:36.230 --> 16:39.393
The scope of the lists we carry is great.

16:39.833 --> 16:57.449
Anything from the British Library, Manchester University Press, Bodleian Library I told you about, and a company called David Fulton, which is a book publisher of educational books for student teachers.

16:59.051 --> 17:06.017
So it's quite a broad list and it gets us into shops, bookshops, that we probably wouldn't have the opportunity to get into

17:06.335 --> 17:10.981
without this sort of clout of a large-ish list.

17:11.842 --> 17:13.644
None of them interfere with our list.

17:13.664 --> 17:16.208
They're complementary but not competition.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.412
Do you think people find the name Yale intimidating?

17:19.692 --> 17:20.193
I think they do.

17:20.553 --> 17:27.802
And especially at the moment when the British book trade is going through, the retail book trade, is going through something of a crisis.

17:28.603 --> 17:32.308
You know, we're sort of shaking down with Amazon and Waterston just about

17:32.930 --> 17:35.873
either to buy up Ottercus or be sold itself.

17:35.933 --> 17:38.276
We don't know where we are with Waterstones.

17:38.296 --> 17:39.737
I didn't realize they were having a hard time.

17:39.777 --> 17:41.519
Yeah, they were having a hard time.

17:41.539 --> 17:43.401
They used to have a wonderful store of boxes.

17:43.421 --> 17:43.962
Oh, they did.

17:43.982 --> 17:51.570
I mean, you won't have a chance to go into them now, but they are like any other, you know, one bookshop is exactly like wherever you are.

17:51.610 --> 17:53.532
They're like Waters and Barnes & Noble.

17:54.093 --> 17:54.594
Exactly the same.

17:55.234 --> 17:58.498
And, you know, three for two, all the same.

17:58.518 --> 17:59.199
It's the marketplace.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.540
It is the marketplace, yes.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.848
So that makes it difficult because, yeah, exactly, it is.

18:04.908 --> 18:05.810
They've got to survive.

18:05.890 --> 18:15.144
I mean, my view is that they should specialise, but still, I don't think they'll... It'll be difficult to turn back the clock, so we just have to, you know, get in there as much as we can with as much product as we can.

18:17.388 --> 18:20.132
But as far as our...

18:21.445 --> 18:23.547
So you asked me a question now, and I forgot what it was.

18:23.567 --> 18:27.051
Well, is the Yale intimidating people?

18:27.071 --> 18:27.511
Yes, the Yale, yes.

18:27.571 --> 18:36.300
But both Yale and University Press are intimidating to young booksellers who haven't perhaps been there very long, haven't been properly trained.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.841
They think, first of all, yeah, oh, that's American.

18:37.881 --> 18:39.803
You know, we're going to have to get it from America.

18:39.823 --> 18:40.324
It's going to be hard.

18:40.384 --> 18:42.586
And then University Press, oh, it must be really scholarly.

18:42.606 --> 18:43.647
So it's actually two strikes.

18:43.727 --> 18:44.608
Yeah, it's two strikes.

18:45.269 --> 18:49.613
So going in with books that we, you know, we've got a reputation.

18:50.453 --> 19:16.478
good reputation in this country but you know it's enforcing that again and again and again with a new generation of book buyers all the time all the time do you have a sense of who your core reader is who your most loyal reader yes i mean with pebsna when we bought pebsna of course we brought in a whole constituency of loyal book buyers it when every time a new pebsna comes out they want it they want to know when the next one is coming out they want to know what it's about

19:16.829 --> 19:18.391
which county it's going to be doing.

19:18.451 --> 19:19.912
So what a great opportunity.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.014
Huge opportunity.

19:21.234 --> 19:22.295
Absolutely fantastic.

19:22.315 --> 19:23.256
You know, to bring the other stuff.

19:23.276 --> 19:23.617
Wonderful.

19:23.697 --> 19:29.583
And it brought with them a wonderful website and a fantastic e-mailing list and ordinary mailing list.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.906
So that was terrifically important.

19:31.926 --> 19:33.828
Is it all generated here, the website?

19:33.848 --> 19:34.088
Yes.

19:34.108 --> 19:36.010
We have two websites, one in the States and one here.

19:36.591 --> 19:37.953
One interesting one.

19:37.973 --> 19:39.955
They link to each other, of course.

19:39.975 --> 19:42.598
But ours is in the same way as our catalogue is different.

19:42.638 --> 19:44.360
Our website is different from the U.S.

19:44.380 --> 19:44.520
one.

19:45.161 --> 19:46.482
Basically because we think we know...

19:47.423 --> 19:50.446
as you say, who our core market is.

19:51.107 --> 20:00.056
And it is very much for our art books, the sort of people who go to exhibitions, who you'll see at the World Academy or see at the National Gallery queuing for an exhibition.

20:00.917 --> 20:10.687
And in history, it's very much the sort of person who buys History Today magazine, who will watch history programs on the BBC, who will buy the BBC History magazine.

20:11.387 --> 20:12.228
Middle-aged, younger?

20:12.248 --> 20:15.051
Middle-aged, growing older, so we have to be sure.

20:15.385 --> 20:17.869
to try to attract the younger audience.

20:17.889 --> 20:18.409
So how do you do that?

20:18.429 --> 20:19.030
With this?

20:19.050 --> 20:20.692
With the catalogue, with emailings.

20:21.434 --> 20:25.419
Of course we do emailings to a lot of academics.

20:26.641 --> 20:27.542
Exhibitions.

20:27.562 --> 20:28.343
Do you measure them?

20:28.924 --> 20:33.410
Is there any way to measure whether or not... We measure it by stripes and we measure it by sales.

20:34.272 --> 20:38.858
And what we found interesting is that, again and again, people will look at our website.

20:39.579 --> 20:42.323
They can get everything they want on the website.

20:42.383 --> 20:45.207
They can look through all our books in print.

20:45.710 --> 20:50.457
But what they will ask for, what they will email us for, is a copy of the paper catalogue.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.400
It's very curious that that continues.

20:52.961 --> 20:53.762
I think it's attractive.

20:53.802 --> 20:56.105
You mean they can... They can see anything.

20:56.145 --> 20:57.107
They can see this online.

20:57.688 --> 20:58.950
They can see this catalogue online.

20:58.970 --> 20:59.450
The full contents.

20:59.470 --> 21:00.973
The full contents.

21:00.993 --> 21:06.220
They can search all our books in print, but they always come back and want a catalogue.

21:06.240 --> 21:06.481
They do.

21:06.741 --> 21:07.382
That's amazing.

21:07.402 --> 21:08.524
It is extraordinary, isn't it?

21:08.544 --> 21:14.012
So how many catalogues do you think normally in a given season that you'll distribute like that?

21:14.144 --> 21:16.947
It's about, we print about 15,000.

21:17.008 --> 21:17.268
Really?

21:17.288 --> 21:18.189
Yeah, yeah.

21:18.209 --> 21:27.681
And we get, you know, we send those out to mailing lists, to book members of the public, booksellers, reviewers, of course, to write to foreign publishers for rights.

21:28.822 --> 21:36.011
We take them to conferences and exhibitions, a lot of specialist ones, of course, as well as the London Book Fair, the Frankfurt Book Fair.

21:36.912 --> 21:39.375
And people, we...

21:39.777 --> 21:41.339
You know, they melt away.

21:41.359 --> 21:42.219
They melt away.

21:42.540 --> 21:43.601
Isn't that something?

21:43.621 --> 21:43.941
It is.

21:44.081 --> 21:46.103
And they must have order for them.

21:46.183 --> 21:47.224
They've got an order for them, of course.

21:47.284 --> 21:49.366
So you can... You can judge that.

21:49.386 --> 21:51.569
But most people still either get buying from them.

21:51.589 --> 21:57.254
And the impact of Amazon, I cannot underestimate, or overestimate, I never know which it is.

21:57.915 --> 22:01.738
I can't say how important Amazon has been to us.

22:01.959 --> 22:02.219
Really?

22:02.239 --> 22:06.523
And how it has changed our sales in the last couple of years, basically.

22:07.204 --> 22:08.485
We...

22:09.038 --> 22:13.403
We started off very tentatively with them, and they would just order what they wanted.

22:13.423 --> 22:22.193
But then, 18 months ago, we decided we would go on to their advantage program, which basically means that they take every single one of our books on consignment into their warehouse.

22:23.215 --> 22:23.295
Wow.

22:23.315 --> 22:25.097
And they don't pay for them until they sell them.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.120
So we have a van going back and forth from our warehouse.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.222
Well, that's changed the whole day.

22:29.242 --> 22:29.762
Completely.

22:30.163 --> 22:30.603
Completely.

22:30.623 --> 22:36.590
So when someone looks at Amazon now, they don't see, you know, oh, it's Yale University Press, so it'll be difficult for them to get it.

22:36.971 --> 22:38.893
They see available in 24 hours.

22:39.498 --> 22:44.584
So Amazon spices it, makes it very attractive.

22:44.605 --> 22:44.705
Yeah.

22:44.725 --> 22:45.926
They've made it terrifically important.

22:46.547 --> 22:48.990
To you, because they'll list all of your titles.

22:49.010 --> 22:49.611
They list all our books.

22:49.651 --> 22:50.452
They're all available.

22:50.632 --> 22:53.916
And on the other hand, you make it irresistible to them.

22:53.936 --> 22:55.058
You don't have to put out any money.

22:55.719 --> 22:56.119
No, they don't.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.983
So they probably had any returns there.

22:59.383 --> 23:00.385
They didn't have any returns.

23:00.565 --> 23:01.506
No, you don't have returns.

23:02.060 --> 23:05.826
But it's expensive because, of course, there's the conciliation.

23:05.946 --> 23:08.069
Yeah, you have to tie up inventory.

23:08.109 --> 23:08.710
I mean, we do that.

23:08.730 --> 23:12.235
We're distributed by Wiley in this country, who are very efficient.

23:12.255 --> 23:14.799
And, of course, they distribute it for a number of people.

23:14.839 --> 23:16.802
So they're doing it for the other people as well as themselves.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.406
So is that basically how Amazon works?

23:19.666 --> 23:21.529
With us, they work like that.

23:21.589 --> 23:22.911
With Wiley, they work like that.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.874
Do they actually buy books from them?

23:24.894 --> 23:26.977
On the whole, they buy from people, yes.

23:27.618 --> 23:30.582
The Advantage program isn't able to once.

23:30.764 --> 23:32.626
Not everybody wants to go into it.

23:32.646 --> 23:35.209
So that's a specific program called the Advantage Program.

23:35.229 --> 23:38.492
Advantage Program, which we went into willingly.

23:38.512 --> 23:41.716
Now, here are Yale back in New Haven as well.

23:41.776 --> 23:44.118
I think Yale and New Haven do it slightly differently.

23:44.559 --> 23:47.002
But of course, again, it's terrifically important for them now, too.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.584
So you have different kinds of sales?

23:49.845 --> 23:50.946
Different kinds of sales, yes.

23:50.966 --> 23:54.630
I mean, Amazon will go into the... People looking on Amazon.

23:54.710 --> 23:58.734
I mean, Yale and London have different kinds of sales with the same people.

23:58.754 --> 23:59.455
Yeah, we do.

23:59.755 --> 24:01.958
Oh, yes, we do, yes.

24:01.978 --> 24:12.033
I mean, our difficulty at the moment, and this isn't really of relevance, but I will tell you, because it is an interesting one, is the fact that the dollar is so weak at the moment, or rather the pound and the euro is strong.

24:12.854 --> 24:23.250
So if we want to, in order to pay for our books to be marketed, distributed, publicised, we have to mark up our books from the US price.

24:23.971 --> 24:28.277
Sometimes we sort of decide not to do that, because we know that it's going to be a really tradey book.

24:28.612 --> 24:30.495
The Gombrich, for instance, is absolutely at par.

24:31.016 --> 24:32.699
It's the same price here as it is in the States.

24:33.340 --> 24:40.952
But booksellers and customers now are so sophisticated, they can look on Amazon, they can look anywhere to see which is the cheapest place to source this book.

24:40.972 --> 24:46.080
So that was one reason we were particularly keen to go into the Amazon Advantage Programme, because they promised

24:46.448 --> 24:54.300
Amazon promised, and I believe that they are keeping to their promise, that they would source their books from the UK and not source from the US, which is what they were doing before.

24:54.681 --> 24:57.805
Hence, you know, the long time to get the books.

24:57.986 --> 24:59.167
Interesting, interesting.

24:59.187 --> 25:00.209
So that was quite important.

25:00.429 --> 25:06.318
So just in the last 18 months, so here we are in March, so we're talking late 04.

25:06.398 --> 25:07.360
Yeah, late 04.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.862
We decided to go in with them.

25:09.503 --> 25:11.226
So you've actually been able to measure that?

25:11.286 --> 25:11.847
Oh, yes.

25:11.907 --> 25:13.649
I mean, it's nearly 200%.

25:14.871 --> 25:15.392
Wow.

25:15.878 --> 25:26.070
Admittedly, of course, it means that our sales to wholesalers have gone down, but not to the extent that our turnover has gone up with Amazon.

25:27.172 --> 25:33.439
So our proportion of sales with Waterstones five years ago was a quarter of our home trade turnover.

25:34.120 --> 25:34.741
Now it's 15%.

25:34.861 --> 25:35.081
Wow.

25:36.643 --> 25:41.028
Independent booksellers, that turnover is beginning now to get better.

25:41.549 --> 25:41.669
Is it?

25:41.689 --> 25:43.371
Yeah, because they're beginning to specialise.

25:44.330 --> 25:47.256
Sales through museums and galleries is steady.

25:47.276 --> 25:50.001
It's pretty steady, but that's a really important part of ours.

25:50.021 --> 25:51.003
Basically the art books.

25:51.023 --> 25:52.546
The art books, yes.

25:52.566 --> 25:55.132
Certainly our art books.

25:55.152 --> 25:55.973
Very interesting.

25:56.214 --> 25:57.857
I haven't even thought about these.

25:57.877 --> 26:00.943
What else do you think?

26:00.963 --> 26:02.226
What else do I think about this?

26:02.426 --> 26:05.933
That would be useful.

26:06.402 --> 26:08.625
I don't depend on you today.

26:08.665 --> 26:11.830
I'm totally out of steam.

26:11.910 --> 26:12.591
Forgive me.

26:12.611 --> 26:13.492
No, no, not at all.

26:13.552 --> 26:15.114
I'm sorry, it's really difficult for you.

26:15.635 --> 26:17.338
It's wonderful.

26:18.179 --> 26:21.644
I requested this, so I'm very happy to have it.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.305
It's very good.

26:22.906 --> 26:24.488
I'm trying to think of other things.

26:24.508 --> 26:26.591
Well, Yale representation I've talked about a bit.

26:27.132 --> 26:30.216
And I've talked about, I mean, John will have told you, and perhaps he won't have done, how

26:30.618 --> 26:32.200
You know, the size of it has changed.

26:32.220 --> 26:39.069
And we talked about when we moved here from Belsize Park.

26:40.431 --> 26:43.394
We moved three years ago from Belsize Park.

26:43.434 --> 26:45.397
She only been here for three years?

26:45.457 --> 26:47.459
We've only been in this building for three years, yes.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.762
So that's 03, right?

26:50.083 --> 26:50.884
03, yes.

26:50.904 --> 26:52.987
We moved in 03, that's right.

26:53.788 --> 26:58.093
And, of course, then shortly afterwards, John's circumstances changed.

26:59.558 --> 27:00.239
Actually, no.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.642
No, his wife died before we moved.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.164
He told me he left in 04, I think.

27:04.425 --> 27:06.407
He left fully in 04, that's right.

27:06.848 --> 27:09.271
But his wife died when we were still in Hampstead.

27:10.253 --> 27:19.145
And then, of course, I mean, the whole, you know, everything shifted quite dramatically because he then had to look after his wife's company.

27:20.026 --> 27:26.555
And he was looking after both us and the US, and Francis Lincoln, which was really hard.

27:26.835 --> 27:27.757
And it was hard for him.

27:27.797 --> 27:28.738
And...

27:29.697 --> 27:35.483
And it became clear that it was not the best way for either of us.

27:35.543 --> 27:37.265
And he'd been here for 30 years, I guess.

27:37.285 --> 27:37.445
Exactly.

27:37.465 --> 27:38.546
It was really hard for him.

27:39.126 --> 27:39.767
Terribly hard.

27:40.888 --> 27:54.642
I mean, not just losing his wife and those absolutely appallingly tragic circumstances, but also then having to... He wanted to sustain, to keep her publishing company going.

27:55.297 --> 27:57.079
And apparently it's quite successful.

27:57.099 --> 27:57.980
It's doing okay, yes.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.043
You told me he's doing some children's books now.

28:00.063 --> 28:01.825
Yeah, they've always been good at children's books.

28:01.845 --> 28:02.566
They do really well.

28:02.907 --> 28:04.288
Of course, he had no experience in doing it.

28:04.889 --> 28:07.292
It wouldn't be surprising if Yale would have been some children's books.

28:07.312 --> 28:10.076
Well, in a way, with the Gombrich, it was a sort of children's book.

28:10.136 --> 28:10.616
Exactly.

28:11.718 --> 28:18.526
But I did a bit of work on, well, I did quite a lot of work, but children's books at Gallants, because they had a very important children's list.

28:18.546 --> 28:20.168
And it did a different market altogether.

28:20.709 --> 28:22.111
Yeah, but for University Press.

28:22.511 --> 28:23.092
Oh, U.P.

28:23.192 --> 28:23.953
still did that after.

28:24.507 --> 28:25.669
At Oxford University Press.

28:25.689 --> 28:26.991
They have quite a few.

28:27.011 --> 28:28.874
Yeah, and that was an important part when I was there.

28:28.894 --> 28:30.176
But Oxford is basically a trade publisher.

28:30.196 --> 28:31.598
It's basically a trade publisher, isn't it?

28:31.618 --> 28:32.520
Yes.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.284
Certainly the New York imprint, which is what I see.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.186
Yes.

28:37.688 --> 28:39.090
Do they do children's books in New York?

28:39.110 --> 28:39.871
They must do it.

28:39.932 --> 28:40.853
Well, I know I get them.

28:41.414 --> 28:42.396
I review children's books.

28:42.416 --> 28:42.776
Oh, do you?

28:42.796 --> 28:44.819
I write them up for children's books.

28:44.899 --> 28:45.581
I love them.

28:45.601 --> 28:46.602
Yeah, I know I do, too.

28:46.662 --> 28:50.889
My wife and I have been reviewing them for 15 or 20 years, and I just wrote one, in fact.

28:51.370 --> 28:51.510
Do you?

28:51.895 --> 28:54.598
Yeah, it's with my 8 to 12.

28:54.778 --> 28:54.958
Oh.

28:56.660 --> 28:56.760
Nice.

28:56.780 --> 28:58.682
So I don't want him to do it.

28:58.702 --> 29:00.644
You know the artist Barry Moser?

29:01.925 --> 29:02.366
No, I don't.

29:02.386 --> 29:06.390
He did the King James Bible, the Penny Royal Press is his press.

29:06.430 --> 29:07.050
Oh, right, right, right.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.653
He did the Huckleberry Finn, the Alice's Adventure.

29:09.673 --> 29:10.734
A contemporary of ours.

29:11.134 --> 29:11.795
Oh, he's alive.

29:11.835 --> 29:12.876
He's alive, yes.

29:12.896 --> 29:14.698
He's a few years older than myself.

29:14.738 --> 29:16.160
He's illustrated about 300 books.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.762
He's really a very, very prominent.

29:18.882 --> 29:19.143
Yes.

29:19.183 --> 29:21.565
Well, he and I have... You've done his book together?

29:21.865 --> 29:25.970
decided to do a series of children's books.

29:26.391 --> 29:26.611
Yes.

29:26.711 --> 29:28.874
Books about books and the lives of people.

29:29.334 --> 29:29.915
Oh, wonderful.

29:30.396 --> 29:32.498
A book on the life is what I'm calling it.

29:33.039 --> 29:39.187
And my first one's about Abraham Lincoln, the Honest Abe's book of grammar, how he... Oh, hi, yes.

29:39.207 --> 29:40.569
He passed the second grade.

29:41.330 --> 29:41.970
I didn't know that.

29:41.990 --> 29:45.595
And it's a well-documented story, but hardly ever written about us, how it

29:46.587 --> 29:51.774
He actually walked six miles to get a book of grammar to teach himself how to become a public speaker.

29:52.014 --> 29:52.534
Oh, goodness.

29:52.555 --> 29:53.356
Memorize it.

29:53.396 --> 29:59.623
Then you can argue that the Gettysburg Address and the American Fiction Proclamation and all of these things come out of this book.

29:59.643 --> 30:00.825
Oh, how wonderful is one book?

30:01.926 --> 30:03.709
Well, I mean, I don't know if you can say it all.

30:03.769 --> 30:06.532
No, no, but I mean, that was the seed, yes.

30:06.552 --> 30:09.095
Well, he'd been reading as a kid.

30:09.616 --> 30:10.477
Yeah.

30:10.497 --> 30:12.780
He did this actually when he was like 22 years old.

30:13.402 --> 30:14.504
when he moved to New Salem.

30:14.524 --> 30:20.794
I mean, it's very well documented, and I just, this is just so much good anecdotal stuff, you know.

30:20.954 --> 30:23.398
I thought I'd try it, 3,000 words, see what happens.

30:23.498 --> 30:23.919
Wonderful.

30:24.079 --> 30:28.787
And I think it took me a month to write it, you know, which is probably a lot longer than I needed to spend on it.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.171
I just kept, and I gave it to my agent.

30:31.191 --> 30:32.913
He just sent it out this past weekend.

30:33.354 --> 30:33.594
Great.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.017
Who knows?

30:35.077 --> 30:36.399
I even loved it.

30:36.679 --> 30:37.080
Lincoln's

30:37.381 --> 30:38.803
Bicentennial is coming up.

30:38.823 --> 30:40.045
Oh, good, good, good, yes.

30:40.125 --> 30:40.685
Shortly.

30:40.705 --> 30:41.306
Oh, is it?

30:41.406 --> 30:42.908
Gosh, that's something you ought to know about.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.350
Oh, nine, I think it is.

30:45.612 --> 30:45.912
Yes.

30:45.933 --> 30:46.814
When is our centennial?

30:46.834 --> 30:47.935
I should know, but I don't know.

30:47.955 --> 30:49.557
When have you got to get this book done by?

30:49.577 --> 30:50.278
Oh, eight.

30:50.298 --> 30:50.599
Oh, eight?

30:50.639 --> 30:51.620
My goodness, you haven't got long.

30:51.981 --> 30:54.104
Well, I'm supposed to have it done this year.

30:54.464 --> 30:57.007
Actually, John wants to publish it next year.

30:57.228 --> 30:57.889
Oh, does he?

30:57.909 --> 30:58.149
Good.

30:58.169 --> 31:03.036
I haven't started writing it yet, but it's... Autumn, autumn, oh, seven, I think you would do it, would we?

31:03.056 --> 31:03.937
I think so, yeah.

31:04.357 --> 31:04.878
Yeah, yeah, good.

31:05.018 --> 31:06.360
I'll start writing soon.

31:06.580 --> 31:07.101
Yeah.

31:07.756 --> 31:12.482
As soon as I feel I have this critical mass... You've got all of it there, yes, yes.

31:12.582 --> 31:15.025
I live 90 minutes from New Haven, so... Oh, do you?

31:15.045 --> 31:16.447
Yes, you can live in there.

31:16.547 --> 31:18.730
So I've been spending a lot of time there.

31:18.750 --> 31:19.491
Yes, yeah.

31:19.511 --> 31:24.217
You'll have to forgive me if I'm not asking with... You're doing fine, you're doing fine.

31:24.237 --> 31:26.821
I mean, wouldn't I like to tell you about how the marketing department works?

31:26.841 --> 31:35.392
Yes, that would be... I mean, basically, this marketing department works quite separate from... but linked all the time with the American office.

31:35.412 --> 31:35.552
Mm-hmm.

31:35.735 --> 31:41.283
So, because the way that the British book trade works is different from the way that the American book trade works.

31:41.843 --> 31:53.600
And we look after here, and I don't know whether you saw in our catalogue, we look after everywhere here except North America, South America, Canada, Japan, Korea, and where else?

31:53.620 --> 31:54.000
Taiwan.

31:54.341 --> 31:57.225
I don't know why those were picked out, but anyway, we look after everywhere else.

31:57.245 --> 32:00.229
So we look after the rest of Southeast Asia, but not those places.

32:00.249 --> 32:01.170
That's interesting.

32:01.190 --> 32:03.413
So I don't know quite how it works, but anyway.

32:03.815 --> 32:09.145
But when you look at that, you'll see what the London office controls.

32:09.746 --> 32:20.507
And of course, our biggest market is the United Kingdom, and the next big market is the rest of Europe, and then the rest of the world is in varying stages of good or not good.

32:21.331 --> 32:25.557
So in this, I run the department and we have three sections.

32:25.637 --> 32:28.921
We have publicity, which is where I sit.

32:28.941 --> 32:31.425
That's the publicity manager there.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.449
We have a sales manager who also looks after year of representation.

32:34.469 --> 32:36.692
So he looks after that as well as sales.

32:37.373 --> 32:40.277
And a direct man, an advertising manager who does everything else, basically.

32:40.297 --> 32:42.640
She does all advertising, all catalogs.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.022
So she's working on the new one of that.

32:44.042 --> 32:46.705
The website, virtually everything.

32:47.146 --> 32:49.549
I mean, she does everything that we pay for on the way of publicity.

32:50.288 --> 32:51.609
And they each have assistants.

32:52.931 --> 33:01.059
And I look after, as well as having overall control, I tend to look after the export market with my job share assistant.

33:01.239 --> 33:02.941
And that works pretty well.

33:03.842 --> 33:07.826
But we do have a very good reputation here for getting good coverage of our books.

33:07.926 --> 33:09.688
And this last weekend has been a really good one.

33:10.069 --> 33:10.829
We've got a wonderful one.

33:10.869 --> 33:15.334
It was a book on John Wilkes, the 18th century book.

33:15.533 --> 33:20.719
politician, which was an American book, which has got terrific legal coverage this weekend.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.463
So we hope that that will... Now Wilkes is an American?

33:24.884 --> 33:34.275
Wilkes is a British MP, rather a rake, rather an exciting sort of interesting and outlandish man.

33:34.355 --> 33:36.597
So now you say you've got reviews?

33:36.677 --> 33:39.641
We've got good review coverage, yes.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.106
We have a review

33:44.288 --> 33:48.673
file that goes around once a month, you know, thick with all the review coverage you've got.

33:49.354 --> 33:52.137
So we were pleased with that this last weekend.

33:53.078 --> 34:05.493
And we do a catalogue twice a year, seasonal catalogue twice a year, and little subject catalogues, as well as flyers, you know, which go out to specialist lists.

34:05.513 --> 34:11.140
So if we're doing a book about Victorian architecture, we would send out a flyer to the Victorian Society.

34:11.474 --> 34:15.059
and they would send it out to their members who do special mailings through that.

34:15.480 --> 34:19.265
And of course, increasingly, email and the internet is becoming an important part.

34:19.285 --> 34:20.747
And can you measure that?

34:20.767 --> 34:21.768
It's difficult to tell.

34:21.868 --> 34:29.880
We do have... We can measure sales, which are still relatively, I mean, really small, through our own website.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.324
And of course, I told you about Amazon, we know how important that's been.

34:33.585 --> 34:37.330
But people on the whole don't... I mean, I don't go to a publisher.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.055
I don't go to a publisher's site.

34:39.095 --> 34:39.355
Do you?

34:39.676 --> 34:39.896
No.

34:39.916 --> 34:40.497
No, I wouldn't.

34:40.517 --> 34:42.620
I might look up to see a little... If I can't find it elsewhere.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.401
Yeah, exactly.

34:43.421 --> 34:44.683
But on the whole, I go to Amazon.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.545
I've done it maybe two or three times in my life.

34:46.566 --> 34:47.307
But you know publishers.

34:47.327 --> 34:49.029
You know which the publisher's likely to be.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.473
And you know roughly who published it.

34:51.493 --> 34:54.517
Most people in the world pay no attention to publishers.

34:54.757 --> 34:55.138
They don't.

34:55.218 --> 34:55.438
They don't.

34:55.458 --> 34:55.999
Exactly.

34:56.019 --> 34:58.262
The first question I always ask is who published the book.

34:58.423 --> 34:59.083
I know.

34:59.224 --> 34:59.764
I always look.

34:59.784 --> 35:00.666
We always look on the spine.

35:00.706 --> 35:01.227
Always.

35:01.247 --> 35:02.949
Always look on the spine to see who published it.

35:03.289 --> 35:04.832
You know, I wanted to know who published your books.

35:04.852 --> 35:05.072
Mm-hmm.

35:06.098 --> 35:09.124
So, you know, it's always interesting to know who would publish it, because they have a sense of it.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.669
But I don't think the punters, I don't think customers do.

35:12.230 --> 35:12.751
They don't at all.

35:12.771 --> 35:13.553
They really don't.

35:13.573 --> 35:19.084
I mean, you know, art historians might think, oh, yes, Yale, that'll be a good book.

35:19.144 --> 35:19.885
You know, we know about it.

35:19.905 --> 35:21.408
It'll be well produced.

35:21.428 --> 35:22.711
We know it'll be well illustrated.

35:22.931 --> 35:24.775
And we know it'll be authoritative.

35:25.176 --> 35:26.438
But on the whole, people don't.

35:26.999 --> 35:27.280
I mean,

35:27.952 --> 35:29.254
Penguin, I know, you know.

35:29.955 --> 35:31.278
I know what sort of books he would be doing.

35:31.378 --> 35:35.565
But on the whole, I don't go straight to someone's network.

35:35.805 --> 35:36.065
No, he does.

35:36.085 --> 35:38.750
Just people who are in the business, writers or editors.

35:38.770 --> 35:38.930
Exactly.

35:39.131 --> 35:42.857
And when we go to a bookshop, we see our book, and we try and put them up front.

35:43.398 --> 35:46.162
Try and put them face out so people will see them.

35:46.383 --> 35:46.703
Yeah, of course.

35:47.341 --> 36:14.884
So when you say you had a good week last week. Yes it was. I mean. It was just the reviews? It was the reviews and you know the the sales were good and we got a shipment in from the states which means that you know back orders have been fulfilled so it was quite a good week. Yes it's really great when you get that and when you release a new book of course that's nice too. You to the that when a book is released to the to the trade, it's nice to see how many go out and you know to plot

36:15.455 --> 36:17.277
Do you have the same kind of returns?

36:17.778 --> 36:18.278
We do.

36:18.318 --> 36:20.581
Nothing like as bad.

36:20.681 --> 36:21.381
Nothing like as bad.

36:21.642 --> 36:24.705
It's crept up to about 12% or 13% average over the year.

36:24.825 --> 36:26.046
I know it's horrific in the States.

36:26.066 --> 36:27.228
It's much worse.

36:27.248 --> 36:30.191
It's the only business I know of where you sell something but you really don't.

36:30.752 --> 36:31.432
Exactly, you don't.

36:31.452 --> 36:35.096
Are you giving these people free, basically, product?

36:35.176 --> 36:35.557
Absolutely.

36:35.877 --> 36:36.778
What are they doing with them?

36:36.798 --> 36:37.999
They hardly open the boxes.

36:38.039 --> 36:39.541
So they can order whatever they want?

36:39.601 --> 36:41.223
They can order whatever they want.

36:41.243 --> 36:45.107
And of course, when we had the netbook system here, when we had post-maintenance,

36:45.442 --> 36:56.400
When that went, the problem of returns would be finished, because booksellers would have exactly the same opportunity to reduce the prices as any other retailer would have.

36:56.741 --> 36:59.165
But somehow, returns keep coming back.

36:59.946 --> 37:02.851
I don't understand why we have allowed it to happen, but it has happened.

37:02.911 --> 37:08.059
Well, I know as an author, and I've never had much of a return.

37:08.099 --> 37:10.403
Most of my books have done okay.

37:10.940 --> 37:15.547
you get some returns, but it allows the publisher to hold back 40% of your royalties, you know.

37:15.567 --> 37:15.967
Oh, right.

37:16.648 --> 37:22.416
You know, by the time I get a payment, you know, it's... Oh, they filled that into your contract today.

37:22.436 --> 37:23.858
I didn't realize that.

37:23.878 --> 37:24.279
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:24.319 --> 37:27.183
They can hold back whatever the percentage is based on... I see.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.425
...as a hedge against returns.

37:28.585 --> 37:28.926
I see.

37:29.006 --> 37:33.352
And then when you finally get your royalty statement, you see this, this, this... Those have gone out, yes.

37:33.853 --> 37:34.393
You know.

37:34.414 --> 37:39.681
Well, we have a link, a very clear link to our... Well, both to our warehouse here.

37:40.066 --> 37:43.109
so I can plot and see, you know, what is selling and what is being returned.

37:43.530 --> 37:46.173
And it's grim sometimes to look and see there are negative sales one week.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.195
That's absolutely appalling.

37:48.535 --> 37:48.675
It is.

37:49.476 --> 37:53.420
And you know that some, you know, more returns will have come back and will have gone out, so that's grim.

37:54.281 --> 38:03.791
But we also have a link to the American, we've got this amazing database now, which we're just beginning to get to grips with, called TMN, which is based in the American office.

38:04.512 --> 38:06.614
Yeah, in fact, when I was over there... Did they show it to you?

38:07.095 --> 38:09.077
Yeah, actually, Janice looked up my own book,

38:09.293 --> 38:09.814
Oh, good.

38:09.874 --> 38:12.237
Harper's hadn't told me how I was doing.

38:12.277 --> 38:13.178
Oh, she could look it up.

38:13.218 --> 38:17.344
Yes, I've not got to grips with that yet because that just shows American sales.

38:17.664 --> 38:19.787
So she says, oh, look at your book.

38:20.928 --> 38:22.510
Thankfully, somebody's telling me.

38:22.711 --> 38:28.939
I mean, actually, that does bring me up to something which I think is quite important about Yale and why authors like us.

38:29.660 --> 38:38.912
Because I think we do have this extraordinary, and I'm sure it's true in the American office, it certainly is true here, that first of all, and Gillian will tell you this,

38:39.331 --> 38:47.883
that not only does she and Sally see the book from inception right the way through production.

38:47.903 --> 38:56.255
They design the books with the author, they sit down with the author and design it with them, so they do the page layout together.

38:57.237 --> 39:06.570
The author has really enormously close contacts with the editor first, and then when it comes on to us, with us too.

39:07.715 --> 39:13.322
I think that's why we are, you know, that authors like us, and that's why they come back to us.

39:13.342 --> 39:22.493
I mean, someone like Eamon Duffy, his book Stripping the Autars, we've sold terrifically well, a book about the Reformation.

39:23.474 --> 39:24.475
What's the title of it, yeah?

39:24.696 --> 39:36.490
Stripping the Autars, it's about how during the Reformation, you know, all the idols and the trappings of religion were just stripped out of all the

39:36.908 --> 39:39.511
Christian churches, by Cromwell's armies.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.772
Of the otters, you called it?

39:41.393 --> 39:42.274
Oh, the altars.

39:43.035 --> 39:43.656
Altars?

39:43.716 --> 39:44.517
I sound like otters.

39:44.537 --> 39:45.778
No, no, the altars.

39:45.798 --> 39:47.680
Is that my Massachusetts accent?

39:47.700 --> 39:49.342
No, no, it's my British accent.

39:49.442 --> 39:51.244
Stripping the altars.

39:51.585 --> 39:52.846
Stripping of the altars, it's called.

39:53.607 --> 39:54.969
Has been enormously successful.

39:54.989 --> 40:03.979
Now, that man, Eamon Duffy, the author, really could be, you know, he could get a huge advance from penguins.

40:04.499 --> 40:20.662
But I think because he's had the thought, well, I mean, I can't take credit for this at all, but I think because he's had that sort of close relationship with his office and his editor and the sales and marketing and promotion people, he feels that he wants to do his next book with us.

40:21.143 --> 40:22.945
Look at Jerry Pelican.

40:22.965 --> 40:23.827
Yeah, exactly.

40:23.847 --> 40:25.389
He could publish this.

40:25.509 --> 40:26.911
He's gravely ill, by the way.

40:27.031 --> 40:27.772
I know.

40:27.832 --> 40:28.373
I'm surprised.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.456
I have to say I'm surprised to hear that he's still alive.

40:31.853 --> 40:34.396
I hope to see him, but it's not going to happen.

40:35.096 --> 40:35.457
I know.

40:35.737 --> 40:40.262
And I know that John Ryden was a sort of mentor for John Ryden.

40:40.282 --> 40:40.622
Really?

40:40.742 --> 40:41.083
Yeah.

40:41.283 --> 40:42.464
And he could have gone.

40:42.685 --> 40:43.225
Oh, he did.

40:43.305 --> 40:45.868
I mean, his books were... Yeah, he did, too.

40:45.928 --> 40:46.248
He did.

40:46.469 --> 40:47.610
And Peter Gay, too.

40:47.630 --> 40:48.511
Oh, Peter Gay.

40:48.551 --> 40:51.214
You see, he was published by us, and then he did some books.

40:51.234 --> 40:52.915
Van Woodward, I think, is another one.

40:52.935 --> 40:53.576
Yeah, yeah.

40:53.596 --> 40:54.998
Jonathan Spence has done a couple of books.

40:55.058 --> 40:56.359
That's right, yes, yes.

40:56.677 --> 40:58.600
People do.

40:58.840 --> 41:08.215
Occasionally what happens is that they will do a book that they wanted to do, which they know perhaps hasn't got the trade sort of potential.

41:08.476 --> 41:09.337
They'll do that with us.

41:10.359 --> 41:21.577
And that's fun to do because, you know, the name... I mean, we've got a book coming by Hugh Trevor Roper in the autumn, you know, which is not a book which is going to sell desperately well, but the name will do terribly well.

41:21.757 --> 41:23.680
I mean, it's a very, very sort of...

41:24.115 --> 41:25.176
Esoteric subject.

41:25.196 --> 41:26.097
Oh, how old is he?

41:26.117 --> 41:26.517
Oh, he's dead.

41:26.538 --> 41:27.038
Oh, he's dead.

41:27.078 --> 41:27.839
He's dead for years.

41:27.859 --> 41:29.000
But this book was left over.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.604
You know, it's a book he'd be worked on from time to time, in between doing other things.

41:32.944 --> 41:34.005
I know.

41:34.225 --> 41:34.446
I know.

41:34.486 --> 41:35.487
He's not alive any longer.

41:36.187 --> 41:37.229
Had he been there for a long time?

41:37.729 --> 41:40.872
I think he died in the 70s.

41:41.313 --> 41:42.354
He died before.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.536
He died shortly after.

41:44.556 --> 41:47.479
I mean, it was sad because there was that terrible scandal about the Hitler diaries.

41:47.779 --> 41:48.540
Oh, I remember that.

41:48.580 --> 41:51.203
And that must have been when he was a very old man.

41:51.807 --> 41:57.597
And he died, but that was the sort of last thing he did, and that was very, very sad, you know, that he was remembered for that.

41:57.617 --> 41:59.480
He was terribly embarrassed by that.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.102
It was awful, and it was pitiful, really.

42:01.984 --> 42:03.907
Very, very sad that that should be the last thing.

42:04.949 --> 42:05.510
You know what?

42:05.530 --> 42:07.513
I'm going to... Do you mind?

42:07.533 --> 42:08.735
No, we've had enough.

42:08.775 --> 42:10.358
Absolutely, we must stop.

42:10.378 --> 42:11.119
I'd like to come back.

42:11.139 --> 42:12.922
Have you been to the library?

42:13.102 --> 42:14.625
I'd like to see that.
