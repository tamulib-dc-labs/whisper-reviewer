WEBVTT

00:04.790 --> 00:07.635
...the proprietary measures in...

00:08.000 --> 00:30.000
[Inaudible speech.]

00:30.000 --> 00:50.000
[Inaudible speech.]

00:50.000 --> 00:58.873
On a particular background, what would it be like to create that background in the Senate for one or another?

00:59.000 --> 01:15.000
[Inaudible speech.]

01:15.000 --> 01:27.000
[Inaudible speech.]

01:29.110 --> 01:30.192
...begin to come together.

01:31.000 --> 02:00.000
[Inaudible speech.]

02:00.040 --> 02:12.570
I think the wonder of 

02:12.550 --> 02:33.131
The wonder for one that is the line of truth, which may be the truth.

02:33.151 --> 02:38.777
And I pray for you to be part of the path of your heart.

02:44.275 --> 02:56.029
That's how I'd like to see you.

02:56.049 --> 02:56.811
I didn't mean 45 minutes of treatment.

02:56.831 --> 02:57.373
You wouldn't mean anything.

03:03.226 --> 03:28.305
In the country, an anniversary of the earth. ...All over, this year. There's a homily in

03:28.522 --> 03:49.939
To you, and to you.

03:50.223 --> 04:14.166
On the grave, no name, no place for the day of death. 

04:14.186 --> 04:15.107
I continue to move the cross of the communion.

04:15.127 --> 04:15.868
I see a marker like a fairy of a hat.

04:15.888 --> 04:16.949
And the word that you need, you are here in the name.

04:16.969 --> 04:18.070
Unfortunately, I want you to be here, I see the greater

04:18.995 --> 04:47.382
There are others that should be read.

04:48.357 --> 05:05.728
I'm not admitting tonight with the whole section of the floor.

05:05.748 --> 05:06.991
This was the book he gave me under his life.

05:07.011 --> 05:08.914
He told me I'll give the life to another great season.

05:16.184 --> 05:40.858
I don't like to fight, fight, face

06:07.973 --> 06:26.424
I can't define you as I am, but only should I say farewell.

06:26.444 --> 06:27.265
The great lame troubles come to my house.

06:27.285 --> 06:27.866
I can't believe that you are.

06:27.886 --> 06:29.509
All of you who are sick and who are sick.

06:31.835 --> 06:42.989
Thank you.

06:55.004 --> 07:14.389
What can I do with this?

07:14.409 --> 07:14.809
I do know what I do.

07:14.830 --> 07:15.090
I only do so.

07:15.110 --> 07:15.550
And this is what I do.

07:15.570 --> 07:16.011
And this is what I do.

07:16.031 --> 07:16.652
So if I am, I will be with you.

07:16.672 --> 07:17.052
I will be with you.

07:22.190 --> 07:45.552
The most few of you, the most important world in fact, is the man of struggle in the history of history and history of life.

07:45.572 --> 07:48.494
How the day's work is done, I collect it.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.236
The other plots are told, I'm going to be so, we know that I will be more than a book.

07:50.256 --> 07:51.437
I love you, and all of you, and all of you, and all of you.

07:52.700 --> 08:03.814
God, you can't.

08:13.546 --> 08:18.412
I don't know why my time is good.

08:18.432 --> 08:18.733
God, you can't.

08:18.753 --> 08:18.953
You can't.

08:22.501 --> 08:34.242
I don't know if I need you.

08:34.262 --> 08:36.406
I think I need a chance.

08:36.426 --> 08:36.587
Find it.

08:36.607 --> 08:37.388
Spread it.

08:37.400 --> 09:40.000
[Inaudible speech.]

09:40.750 --> 09:44.079
All right, Nick, should we go for a few minutes?

09:56.213 --> 09:56.413
All right.

09:59.077 --> 10:25.168
I could not then read them.

10:25.553 --> 10:32.506
And they were not yet many of the poets the writer might speak of.

10:35.471 --> 10:43.866
The writers I read then were some of them.

10:45.584 --> 11:00.711
I love them because they couldn't remove them.

11:00.731 --> 11:02.935
They couldn't let a marriage go past them anymore.

11:02.915 --> 11:27.831
I love them because they seem to me so much.

11:27.851 --> 11:28.893
I need to talk to the writers about these classics.

11:28.913 --> 11:30.075
So many readers want to say that I really love that movie.

11:30.095 --> 11:30.796
Boy, there's so many in the future.

11:30.816 --> 11:31.757
I hope those nations will learn more than this.

11:31.757 --> 12:37.195
[Inaudible speech.]

12:37.195 --> 13:05.802
Do you ever have writing down unless you do, to overcome it?

13:05.802 --> 13:23.872
[Inaudible speech.]

13:23.872 --> 13:42.792
Thank you.

13:42.772 --> 14:06.602
I have days when I resist the action of going on in my life, but I cannot have an extra piece of it.

14:07.055 --> 14:21.518
an extra glass of juice, an extra cup of coffee, I'll leave a paper, I'll fall.

14:21.538 --> 14:28.408
On those days when all was failed to be, I had even, I had even a small fall in my life.

14:28.428 --> 14:31.493
So you say, how petty, how small, how endless, I am, and it's true, I am just so desperate not to go into my life.

14:31.473 --> 14:52.030
Yet, when you finally owe to it, when you could pick up over a period of time some rhythm of work, then sometimes, as happens when you are deep in the life of the book, all of this things transpires, as if the life of the book takes forever over your whole life.

14:52.010 --> 15:02.069
The writing does not write itself.

15:02.090 --> 15:04.434
You still labor in living.

15:04.454 --> 15:10.887
One of the things then is that somehow or other the work that comes home seems guided by your strength and the vision greater than your life.

15:10.907 --> 15:13.191
Another poet once said, I held in those moments that you are creating God's invitation.

15:13.610 --> 15:27.870
And the writing goes with a great strength and a great power.

15:27.890 --> 15:30.594
And I know the line comes to me from an old Greek tragedy then, that the writer might feel in that moment.

15:30.614 --> 15:31.956
When, in the tragedy, the line goes, still their spirit will begin.

15:34.518 --> 15:54.636
And I think, having experienced a moment, when I come to a moment, when I come to a period of time where I think I'm going to remember the moment, I'm going to remember the beauty of a moment, and I'm seeking to struggle back for some blessed man to remember the moment.

15:57.738 --> 16:12.561
That sense of vision, of the magic.

16:12.581 --> 16:15.125
The magical way I solve that block is the whole story of that.

16:15.145 --> 16:15.806
Writers do many different things.

16:15.826 --> 16:16.587
They go through little rituals.

16:16.747 --> 16:20.132
They have writers, they sharpen the pencils.

16:20.152 --> 16:21.855
I have new writers here tonight to be in the state of the city.

16:21.835 --> 16:28.535
what the engage might say in response to what you want.

16:29.057 --> 16:33.550
Everybody needs this as we call it.

16:45.173 --> 17:04.611
Have you ever thought of doing work for stage or television?

17:04.631 --> 17:06.352
I've done some writing.

17:06.753 --> 17:08.114
I made the journey of so many writers in Hollywood.

17:08.134 --> 17:08.674
I stayed a couple of years.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.116
I actually made one of my books at Woodville.

17:10.136 --> 17:10.516
And it's all right.

17:10.536 --> 17:12.598
One has to come to an understanding that writing for play, for a student play,

17:12.578 --> 17:27.159
or something for the stage or television.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.161
These are separate parts of the art of the novel.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.142
So those things I have, you cannot write novels.

17:29.162 --> 17:29.763
Those novels you cannot write.

17:29.783 --> 17:29.983
They play.

17:30.003 --> 17:30.604
I intend to feel closer to me.

17:30.584 --> 17:45.606
Thank you.

17:45.586 --> 18:05.791
exciting films made by God.

18:05.811 --> 18:11.738
And regardless of what your experiences have been in the past, still there is always the possibility of the tools established and talents that one can lead to the stunning transitions of God.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.500
So the answer I suppose would be, I don't have to rule work at it, but I will continue.

18:16.940 --> 18:30.156
Professor Jacques, if you were supposed to do so, do you send an urge about taking cell marks as your funny cell marks?

18:30.254 --> 18:39.109
The question is about Stelmark, whether I feel any urge of the Stelmark that I read to a brief copy from.

18:39.851 --> 18:42.195
These are autobiographical fragments.

18:42.335 --> 18:44.018
I wrote them a number of years ago.

18:44.479 --> 18:45.801
It did not appeal to yet.

18:45.821 --> 18:49.427
I have my own here so I can look back over my life.

18:49.407 --> 18:55.075
and write full-fledged of art, but I did write frightens on it.

18:55.095 --> 19:07.112
And yes, there are passages I think I would like to add that the older I become, the more I see aspects of my life changing.

19:07.132 --> 19:12.900
Though it's like the light in the comfort side and given moment as the light descends,

19:12.880 --> 19:23.039
different areas of the landscape are revealed.

19:23.059 --> 19:30.012
And as we grow, I think, older, different areas of our past experience come to a different shape, come to a different life experience.

19:29.992 --> 19:45.064
And I would like not only to add things to the Stealth Park, but I would like to rewrite experiences in the Stealth Park that I see now from the added vantage point of another decade or 20 years have changed.

19:45.044 --> 20:07.012
You know, the writer has it as the greatest source of release, all of the experience, the illness, the cold, the cold, the death, the cold, the cold, the most uncertain, tragedies, or sorrow, and online.

20:07.032 --> 20:09.415
And yet the writer has the opportunity to see, by writing about it, to be calmly softened, demonized, and eternal life.

20:10.306 --> 20:33.210
And by these people who write a bit, you are able to wait and actually continue to a great little portion of order.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.051
Writers very rarely begin with solutions.

20:34.071 --> 20:34.571
They begin with problems.

20:34.591 --> 20:35.092
They begin with dilemmas.

20:35.112 --> 20:36.874
And the writing is the process of unraveling and exploring and exploiting that question.

20:36.894 --> 20:37.174
So that means,

20:37.154 --> 21:04.815
[Inaudible speech.]

21:10.364 --> 21:19.259
But I've been on stage for so many years now, and I do it in relation to the writing.

21:19.279 --> 21:29.296
I, as a boy, in, again, the same area of school, acted in the Greek tragedy, like the preon and the rest of us.

21:29.536 --> 21:30.718
I think it made it clunk.

21:30.698 --> 21:47.533
I think I would have gone, I would have loved to gone into acting, if I have not been by the series of curious events, if I have not been in life.

21:47.553 --> 21:48.155
But the affordability remains.

21:48.175 --> 21:49.838
And what has happened is that true life leaves us.

21:49.818 --> 22:12.771
I think there is the other aspect that is important for me too is that my father was a priest and growing up in the Orthodox Church and the memory of the night of the Ascension.

22:12.751 --> 22:36.699
There was a feeling about that, of course, there of the original faith, but there is a certain, there is a certain tendency to be on stage in that whole truth of the original part of that.

22:36.719 --> 22:38.040
I loved it, and I think the wisdom of that have come into my work.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.003
And for a while, I thought and contemplated with the possibility to come into it.

22:40.023 --> 22:40.323
I wanted that.

22:40.343 --> 22:41.104
My father wanted one of his sons to be

22:41.084 --> 22:59.409
There have been one in the family for several generations behind.

22:59.429 --> 23:04.095
For one or another reason, by the end of this life, we were grateful we had not.

23:04.115 --> 23:07.660
And yet, long after the death of a thousand times when I go to college for a congregation of four of the seven years, when I ascend to the chapel, I look down for the audience.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.982
Then the top of Boston, I thought,

23:09.552 --> 23:16.704
Like a back door in some way behind me.

23:17.105 --> 23:24.017
So in a way, I am fortunate many writers who are fine writers, as you say, do not have their presence.

23:24.419 --> 23:38.120
one talent has nothing to do with the other.

23:38.140 --> 23:47.594
But because I am able to vote, I then have that same pleasure of speaking before the line audience and getting the music reaction.

23:47.615 --> 23:50.058
You know, when I say that the actor has, again, I remain also for most of the time a writer in the voice that I'm married.

23:50.078 --> 23:51.861
Does it help me in my writing?

23:51.841 --> 24:11.134
Well, I remember the warmth of an audience and wish sometimes that I have an audience with me as I go.

24:11.154 --> 24:12.076
I think to some degree it probably has helped.

24:12.096 --> 24:14.119
I think testing certain pieces of writing, not an audience, you get at least an audience reaction.

24:14.099 --> 24:23.113
And the rhythms of the writing are very important.

24:23.133 --> 24:25.176
So for me, the spoken rhythm of voice is important.

24:25.196 --> 24:33.289
I read all my work out loud as I'm writing it too.

24:33.309 --> 24:34.691
So I'm not only testing against the eye, but testing against the eye.

24:34.711 --> 24:35.112
Thank you very much.

24:49.537 --> 25:07.326
Thank you.

25:11.120 --> 25:23.155
Thank you.
