00:02.056 --> 00:07.403
The tape recorder is now running, and we're talking with Professor Roger Chartier in Paris.

00:07.483 --> 00:10.247
And I guess if we can just start generally.

00:11.829 --> 00:20.421
Histoire du livre is a French development, and you are considered the premier proponent of this.

00:20.782 --> 00:28.232
I wonder, first of all, why it took scholars so long to look at the history of books as a reliable index.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.976
of how culture changes, especially as it deals with reading.

00:32.016 --> 00:51.148
Yes, it's true and not, because I think there was a history of the book since the moment in which, perhaps in the manuscript era, but after the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg, very rapidly there were some narratives about

00:51.415 --> 01:08.015
the invention itself, and you know it was competition between different people, Gutemberg, Koster, the Netherlands, and after there was, in the 17th, 18th century, a kind of history of the printing press.

01:08.515 --> 01:20.950
I have just worked recently on a famous text by Denis Diderot, who is now, his text is now in fashion because he's dealing with copyright and literary property.

01:21.183 --> 01:39.062
And in a recent issue of Daedalus last year, there was a reflection trying to connect the Deidreau's reflection in the 18th century on the literary property and what happened to copyright now in the world of electronic textuality.

01:39.543 --> 01:49.013
And so there was an interest for the history, the development, the progress, the difficulty of the

01:49.297 --> 01:53.203
of the book, particularly in its printed form.

01:53.583 --> 02:10.208
But you are right, in terms of scholarship, the history of the book was during a long time a purely technical matter and used particularly for the edition of text.

02:10.188 --> 02:14.716
or for establishing catalogs.

02:14.736 --> 02:27.758
And it seems to me that after the Second World War, a book written by the great French historian Lucien Fay with the help of a very young scholar at the time

02:28.025 --> 02:52.935
the coming of the book, the book was translated in many languages and particularly in English, was brought the first time in which something established at the Histoire du Livre was proposed, that is to say a linkage between an economic and social dimension of the history of the production and producer of printed books.

02:52.915 --> 03:10.176
And on the other hand, a reflection about the contribution of this medium to the religious transformation, to the progress of science, to the transformation of mentalities, and so on.

03:10.716 --> 03:15.362
And from this book, 1948, in the French edition,

03:15.342 --> 03:25.323
There was a development in France, but not only in France, of a new genre of histoire du livre, perhaps insufficiently technical sometimes.

03:25.383 --> 03:36.726
And some bibliographers in America, in England, in the New Zealand, Australian half sometimes could decide this lack of knowledge about it.

03:36.706 --> 03:48.026
the book as a material artifact in this perspective developed by the French historians, more or less connected with the Annale school.

03:48.487 --> 03:57.803
But in spite of this limit, it seems to me that this Historie de Lis was developed in order to widen

03:58.120 --> 04:10.060
the spectrum of questions dealing with the production, the circulation, and diffusion, or the consumption of the book.

04:10.561 --> 04:17.513
And it's the basis for what was developed more recently, and particularly

04:17.493 --> 04:33.195
I mean, for connecting, it seems to me the more carefully, more cleverly perhaps, an analysis of the text and an analysis of the book, because you have this fundamental ambiguity.

04:33.215 --> 04:39.043
A book for us is both a specific object which is different from other objects in the written culture.

04:39.063 --> 04:43.028
A book is not a newspaper, it's not a journal, it's not a letter.

04:43.008 --> 04:57.456
But at the same time, if you are talking about the book by Humberto Eco, it's not direct less, it's material reality which is in that, but the content that is the work identified as a book.

04:57.622 --> 05:02.934
with its coherence, originality, specificity.

05:03.315 --> 05:13.960
And so it seems to me now this ambivalent nature of the book as a specific artifact, a material object, and the book as

05:14.328 --> 05:27.762
defined as a certain kind of discourse is perhaps at the core of a new stage, a new step in the history of the livre.

05:28.183 --> 05:30.765
Why it was so long to take into account?

05:31.246 --> 05:39.795
It seems to me because when history was dominated on the one hand by

05:40.518 --> 05:42.981
an analysis of the text as such.

05:43.522 --> 05:50.311
There was no interest paid for the materiality in which these texts were inscribed.

05:50.912 --> 05:59.303
And if you are thinking about political history, diplomatic history, religious history, the texts were, in a certain sense, disincarnated.

05:59.684 --> 06:01.827
They were dematerialized.

06:01.847 --> 06:10.018
And people were interested by the ideas or by the content and without knowledge or interest for

06:09.998 --> 06:11.160
the material form.

06:11.400 --> 06:30.266
And on the other hand, in the domain of economic and social history as developed by the Annals in the 1930s and also by the New History in America, it's clear that the book was not a very important material artifact.

06:30.326 --> 06:34.432
Yes, the materiality is the essential point.

06:34.452 --> 06:35.113
Yes, exactly.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.217
So in this sense, there was a kind of gap

06:38.197 --> 06:56.020
between an interest for the text without interest for the book and very limited parts of the book in the production or commerce of goods, which were dominated by other production and other products.

06:56.000 --> 07:20.775
And so I think it was just after the Second World War when there was this perception that the book was a commodity and the book was the vehicle for conception, ideas, representation, and both one linked with the other, then perhaps there was a starting point for the Histoire du livre.

07:20.755 --> 07:36.351
Now, you've written – you point out that the French Revolution is perhaps the quintessential example of where the printed books or writings can have a powerful impact on the changing –

07:36.652 --> 07:39.877
on the making of history.

07:39.897 --> 07:55.063
Can you think of any other really important landmarks and historical events where we can say, where we can look at people's reading as being influential in the way events unfolded?

07:55.784 --> 08:00.432
I think I've been up to say that, in first instance, that all the printed matter

08:00.884 --> 08:02.285
is not books.

08:02.305 --> 08:21.846
And when you mention the French Revolution or the 70s or 80s of the 18th century in France, or if we are thinking about the English Revolution, what is dominant is the circulation of labels, pamphlets, newsbooks, newspapers.

08:22.366 --> 08:29.153
And so in order to be correct, perhaps to think that and to stress

08:29.420 --> 08:41.613
the fact that particularly in the moment of crisis there was a kind of invasion by the printed matter in the entire society, but the printed matter which is not necessarily the book.

08:41.653 --> 08:51.764
And during the French Revolution there was a decreasing of the production of books and an extraordinary multiplication of these other printed matters.

08:51.785 --> 08:54.988
And I suppose we could have the same kind of diagnosis.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.791
for the English Revolution.

08:58.152 --> 09:12.408
And so this is very important because now it seems to me that the Histoire du Livre is widened in two directions, both because it tried to encompass all these very ephemeral printed methods.

09:12.428 --> 09:13.910
And you agree with that, I believe.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.453
I think so, I guess, profoundly.

09:16.433 --> 09:31.667
It's a difficulty also because if you are looking to your theological in folio of the 16th century, you have a good chance to meet a lot of copies of this edition.

09:32.087 --> 09:45.259
If you are searching some more popular materials or just some panthers or levels sometimes, all the editions have disappeared because they were without any value economically.

09:45.239 --> 09:47.244
And also they were very fragile.

09:47.605 --> 10:01.999
So there is a correction to make for the perspective about what is the printed production in a given time.

10:01.979 --> 10:03.602
at the time.

10:04.063 --> 10:08.050
It's paradoxical, but I think there is something right in this.

10:08.451 --> 10:23.177
And now also there is another element which is to consider, and particularly also in the period of crisis you mentioned, the French Revolution, the English Revolution, perhaps the American Revolution, the role played by the

10:23.157 --> 10:27.184
what some historian has called a scribal publication.

10:27.645 --> 10:39.445
That is to say we have to, you know, refuse a perspective according to which you have a pre-Gottemberg era of manuscript culture and a post-Gottemberg era

10:39.425 --> 10:41.308
of printed matter.

10:41.509 --> 11:01.686
In fact, the manuscript as a medium for circulation of text, as a form for publication of text, resisted to the printed matter and played a role which was often undervalued.

11:01.666 --> 11:03.409
by the historian.

11:03.469 --> 11:12.684
But fortunately, recently, there was a lot of attention paid to the scribal culture at the time of the Gutenberg press.

11:13.125 --> 11:20.857
Well, certainly we have to think of the book as something other than, in addition to the conventional codex, and I think that's what you're talking about.

11:21.979 --> 11:24.583
The book is almost a generic term.

11:25.044 --> 11:28.129
It's been used almost as a generic term to identify

11:28.396 --> 11:31.081
any kind of printed object.

11:31.782 --> 11:33.124
Written object.

11:33.205 --> 11:34.246
Written object.

11:34.266 --> 11:36.150
In fact, you were talking about survival culture.

11:36.390 --> 11:36.911
Exactly.

11:37.292 --> 11:42.501
And of course, today now we have the electronic book, which is a whole other, which you've written about as well.

11:43.263 --> 11:46.709
Are you familiar with an exhibition in the United States?

11:46.749 --> 11:47.991
There was a catalog

11:48.427 --> 11:59.500
It was back in the 1940s, but it was the Grolier Club, a list of 100 most influential books published in America prior to 1900.

11:59.767 --> 12:04.514
And you'd be amazed at how many of these objects were precisely what you're talking about.

12:04.914 --> 12:08.519
Pamphlets, for instance, or the Sears Roebuck catalog.

12:10.001 --> 12:14.367
People were wondering, what in the world would a catalog in which you could order goods?

12:14.928 --> 12:16.390
Why would that be influential?

12:16.430 --> 12:23.580
But there are people who argue that you could never have developed the Midwest and the Western frontier without this catalog.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.206
And that's a book, and that's a book that people read, or the telephone book.

12:27.226 --> 12:37.041
I think maybe that's going maybe a bit too far, but they did choose these objects as 100 of the most influential.

12:37.081 --> 12:48.538
You also have written, and I find it really fascinating, that I think you said in the 1500s and the 16th century that in Spain there was an attempt to suppress all works of fiction.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.431
because they were considered dangerous.

12:51.317 --> 12:54.377
How is it that fiction could be considered dangerous?

12:54.830 --> 12:56.452
Oh, yeah.

12:56.873 --> 12:59.297
I think I know the answer, but I'd love to hear you articulate it.

12:59.777 --> 13:01.199
No, no, you're right.

13:01.660 --> 13:15.861
I think the main elements, because this hostility to fiction was not only in Golden Age Spain, you can find also some traces of this in the 18th century.

13:16.321 --> 13:20.247
But in the case you mentioned, it's because of...

13:20.227 --> 13:31.063
The fact that fiction can substitute in the mind of the reader a fictional world.

13:31.465 --> 13:45.347
and in a sense to create a kind of fictional world more interesting, more pleasant than the real one.

13:46.028 --> 13:53.220
And in this case of Spain, there was a reference to Plato when in the Republic the poets,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.664
are expelled from the Republic.

13:56.787 --> 14:15.681
And it was in the 16th century a recession in two manner, both with the Christian dimension, that is to say only God is the creator, and the writer who tried to create worlds is also, in a sense, is trespassing

14:15.914 --> 14:18.820
the only power of God.

14:19.862 --> 14:31.948
And secondly, there was also a kind of vision according to which there was, like in Don Quixote, there is a kind of loss

14:32.485 --> 14:40.978
of the sense of the world by this excess of fiction and this excess of reading.

14:41.398 --> 14:53.076
The 18th century, we fashioned this in a very medical language, and in the 18th century you have a lot of denunciation of fiction which are using

14:53.056 --> 15:11.942
The vocabulary of medicine, that is to say the fever for reading, like an illness, a kind of epidemy because it's collective, and personal and individual illness because the individual has completely lost.

15:11.922 --> 15:20.236
this relation with the world and projecting himself or herself in a fictitious world.

15:20.256 --> 15:30.252
So there was this distrust vis-à-vis fiction which was using both at the same time reference to the Neoplatonist philosophy

15:30.232 --> 15:43.195
to the Christian morality and also to a kind of, in particular in the 18th century, a kind of medical discourse.

15:43.716 --> 15:45.179
And so you have this.

15:45.599 --> 15:54.315
There was a lot of fiction published, written and published from the 16th century to the 18th century, but we have not to forget that it was against

15:54.295 --> 16:08.389
this discourse condemning this invention of imaginary world, which were considered as a danger for a reader living in another world, the real one.

16:08.639 --> 16:11.725
And were they successful at all in trying to suppress it?

16:12.726 --> 16:33.043
In this case, it was also connected with the colonization because the first text, legislative text, were forbidding the printing and introduction of this different fictional genre in the Indias.

16:33.023 --> 16:38.251
that is to say, in the Spanish colonies in the New World.

16:38.912 --> 16:58.440
There was an attempt in 1555 to impose this to Spain, but in fact they failed because, as you know, it was a time in which perhaps the Spanish literature invented the more modern form of fiction, not only Don Quixote, but also the picaresque novels.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.647
And so there was this paradoxical situation.

17:02.887 --> 17:03.808
Spain was both.

17:04.409 --> 17:15.567
At the same time, the country in which you have the more determined legislative text against fiction, and at the same time perhaps the matrix of the modern literature.

17:15.988 --> 17:25.744
Do you think this has been apparent throughout modern history, modern being over the last several hundred years, that fiction, wherein fiction does have the power,

17:25.724 --> 17:33.013
to be dangerous or to influence historical events?

17:33.033 --> 17:40.903
The problem is the fact that it seems to me that now the more powerful fictional are not necessarily the written and printed ones.

17:41.804 --> 17:53.638
And here there was the same discussion in 16th century because in pain if there was this fear for fiction it's because at the time the reading silently

17:53.618 --> 17:56.282
and in solitude was developed.

17:56.302 --> 18:07.761
If you read collectively a large fictional text, immediately the difference between the world of the text and the world of the reader and the listeners is evident.

18:09.104 --> 18:12.389
You are not in the world of the text.

18:12.409 --> 18:16.656
You are in a real world in which someone is reading a large text to the others.

18:16.636 --> 18:34.223
At the time, in the 16th century, you have the development among the elite of reading silently and in solitude, like the way through which Don Quixote is reading the Chivaric novels.

18:34.203 --> 18:57.814
This projection of the text within the reader or the projection of the reader within the text are the basis for this fear against fiction and also the basis for this extraordinary invention and creation which is this Cervantes novel written by Cervantes.

18:57.794 --> 19:14.740
I've now seen the moment in which fiction was mainly transferred on the screen, the screen of the movie, the screen of the TV, and perhaps now the screen of the computer.

19:14.720 --> 19:28.898
You have another form of this blurring erasure between the world of the viewer, of the beholder, and the world of the fiction, and perhaps here.

19:29.165 --> 19:34.632
There is some risk, danger, pleasure, I don't know, all the things at the same time.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.715
And it was a case in the 18th century.

19:36.735 --> 19:38.438
It was a case in the 16th century.

19:38.918 --> 19:43.745
Fiction was pleasurable and fiction was considered as dangerous.

19:44.005 --> 19:55.020
And with the screen of the 20th and 21st century, movies, theater, TV, and computer,

19:55.000 --> 20:01.531
We have to have the same ambivalence between pleasure and Europe.

20:01.551 --> 20:09.424
I have to tell you this book that you co-edited with Guillermo Cavallo, A History of Reading in the West, which I think is fabulous.

20:09.504 --> 20:15.895
I think it's the best book out there, the best comprehensive look at this whole development.

20:16.246 --> 20:20.791
And I have it right here, and to me it's an essential text.

20:21.351 --> 20:26.757
In here you write that a text exists only because a reader gives it meaning.

20:27.758 --> 20:30.000
And I'd love to explore that.

20:30.040 --> 20:30.841
Is it possible?

20:31.382 --> 20:40.572
I wonder, for instance, when you think of the Gnostic Gospels, which have lain buried in the desert for hundreds of years, do they only get meaning when they're discovered 2,000 years later?

20:42.954 --> 20:45.797
Does a text only get meaning from the reader?

20:46.300 --> 20:54.412
We can say it's connected with your point on the more influential books in America.

20:54.553 --> 21:05.930
It's an exaggerated sentence because a book has a first meaning because someone has written this book.

21:06.070 --> 21:14.603
And for the writer, even if there is no other reader than himself or herself, the book is acquired.

21:14.583 --> 21:42.193
But if you are thinking about the meaning in a more collective, social dimension, and here connected with this concept perhaps debatable but useful or influential, clearly it's because readers are appropriating the text in very different ways and different periods and places that the text is always

21:42.494 --> 21:48.569
recreated by these reading practices.

21:48.950 --> 21:57.651
And in the sense of, effectively, if you are thinking of a text which is no reader except the man or the woman who has written it,

21:57.631 --> 22:07.328
He has a meaning, but he's not influential in any manner, I can say, except for his writer.

22:07.669 --> 22:18.087
If you are thinking about the meaning as appropriation of text, reception of text, refashioning of text, displacement of...

22:18.067 --> 22:22.671
their importance in different contexts.

22:23.191 --> 22:42.328
Clearly, here, this tension between what is proposed by the text and what is protected by the different reading communities is a key historical fact we have to deal with, it seems to me.

22:42.348 --> 22:44.710
And it's the reason why I say this.

22:45.070 --> 22:48.073
And it also, you can also interpret this in

22:48.053 --> 23:06.737
Not in the collective and social dimension, but in the, I think it's a sentence more or less of a paraphrase of something written by Paul Ricoeur in a completely different dimension, which is a dimension of hermeneutics, that is to say that the text is inert.

23:06.717 --> 23:12.547
And as a text, he has no life.

23:13.008 --> 23:17.176
And the life is given by the fact that someone is appropriating it.

23:17.196 --> 23:30.379
And so even if you are outside of the perspective of social and collective history, if you are in the perspective of phenomenology of reading or ameneutics, also this sentence,

23:30.359 --> 23:46.956
As meaning, that is to say, the fact the dialogue, the dialectical relationship between the text and the reader, the reader and the text, is always giving meaning to the words on the page.

23:47.376 --> 23:52.462
And one thing you point out is that the text itself is inscribed in one fashion or another.

23:52.562 --> 23:57.767
If it's on stone or if it's on paper or on parchment or wherever it is,

23:58.085 --> 23:59.627
an artifact.

23:59.687 --> 24:03.392
It's a solid object that we can see.

24:03.893 --> 24:08.939
Whereas the reader's interaction with the text, as you also point out, is ephemeral.

24:10.361 --> 24:15.969
And it's very difficult to measure the reaction, I guess, unless the reader leaves something.

24:16.830 --> 24:22.798
And so how do you as a scholar in this area measure the impact on the reader?

24:23.178 --> 24:26.202
How does one go about trying to assess that, I wonder?

24:26.182 --> 24:29.286
Yes, it's a great difficulty for the history of reading.

24:29.326 --> 24:38.597
But as I said some time, that is not because the historical problem is difficult or sometimes without any evidence that it is not important.

24:39.077 --> 24:49.730
And during a long time, historians have thought that the problems, the more important problems were the problems they were able to solve, because a lot of documents have been produced by the past.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.312
It's not true sometimes.

24:51.292 --> 25:00.154
The documents are not very interesting, and some problems without very important or impressive documentation are absolutely crucial.

25:00.515 --> 25:07.292
It's a case, it seems to me, with this appropriation of text by readers.

25:07.272 --> 25:11.617
There are different ways of different strategies.

25:12.097 --> 25:26.333
Some are more collective, that is to say, to reconstruct the different convention, norms, learning of reading practices.

25:26.614 --> 25:31.339
You cannot get with this the dimension of the individual.

25:31.319 --> 25:48.973
But if you accept that the idea according to which every reader belongs to an interpretive community, a reading community, you can reconstruct something of the values, interests, norms, practices,

25:48.953 --> 26:01.544
of this community, the monastic reader of the 12th century, the humanist reader of the 16th century, the female readership in the 18th century, and so on.

26:01.564 --> 26:07.009
So it's the first layer, if I can say, for the history of reading.

26:07.410 --> 26:18.960
If you want to be closer to the individual reader and closer to this act of appropriation, it's clear that you need to hear some traces

26:18.940 --> 26:36.140
On the one hand, some reader has left memories, comments about the readings in different kinds of documents, like diaries, letters.

26:36.340 --> 26:38.262
Machinari of text.

26:38.543 --> 26:47.513
The other element, because here I am thinking or talking about what is external to the book read, which is a production of a new writing.

26:48.100 --> 27:02.917
And you have also, as you said, and more and more developed and more and more important in the last decades analysis of the marginalia, the handwriting within the printed text.

27:03.417 --> 27:07.282
And so it's an immense domain of analysis.

27:07.942 --> 27:13.028
What I want to say is just something sometimes which is forgotten because

27:13.008 --> 27:23.623
On the one hand, the more individualistic, the more personal documents are always framed within collective constraints.

27:23.643 --> 27:35.539
And if you are looking at the marginalia in many books of the 16th century, you don't discover something which is very personal.

27:35.519 --> 27:56.960
the marginalia organized according to techniques, which is to look at the sentences, the excerpts, the example in the book, which can be after copied in the commonplace books and reused if you have to produce a new discourse.

27:57.220 --> 28:05.188
So even if it is very singular and individual, this singularity is encapsulated within

28:05.168 --> 28:06.997
collective convention.

28:07.721 --> 28:11.922
And conversely it seems to me that

28:12.695 --> 28:31.057
you can find the fact that always a specific reader is not completely dominated and shaped by the convention of which defined the reading communities to which he belonged.

28:31.458 --> 28:37.605
And so it's a political movement, if you want, on the one hand, how to look how

28:37.585 --> 29:02.226
some readers have dispersed or displaced the constraints which were imposed on them, and conversely to try to look at what is normative, conventional, shared in any form of singular expression about

29:02.206 --> 29:17.835
And so the great difficulty, of course, is the fact that what we have said about diaries, memoirs, correspondence, marginalia.

29:17.815 --> 29:26.810
is very important and available for readers belonging to the different elites of the society.

29:26.990 --> 29:38.309
If you are interested, as I am, in the more popular readers, it's very difficult to find any of these kinds of traces, particularly for the 16th or 17th century.

29:38.650 --> 29:44.059
Even if you can see a development of the autobiographical genre,

29:44.039 --> 29:52.433
among the workers and particularly in the cities since the 17th century on.

29:52.894 --> 30:05.575
But, of course, there is a great discrepancy, and the more numerous readers are the more difficult, or the humblest readers are the more difficult.

30:05.555 --> 30:10.521
to approach with this kind of sources.

30:10.541 --> 30:21.714
Now, the American historian David McCullough, for instance, has told me that he believes there would not have been an American Revolution if there hadn't been Thomas Paine.

30:21.834 --> 30:25.819
And, of course, the popularity of Common Sense was extraordinary.

30:25.859 --> 30:31.005
There were perhaps 150,000 copies of that pamphlet.

30:31.188 --> 30:34.212
And yet, how did people respond to it?

30:34.232 --> 30:36.454
I think that's exactly what you're saying.

30:36.474 --> 30:48.609
Just the fact that it circulated so tremendously suggests that it had an impact, even if there is not a lot of record left behind of how it directly influences the reader.

30:48.649 --> 30:50.351
I think that's kind of something.

30:50.371 --> 30:50.492
Yes.

30:50.512 --> 30:55.778
Sometimes you can also have traces of this reading, not directly in the

30:55.977 --> 31:10.762
writings, but because the text was conveyed to people, to rumors, to actions, to spectacles.

31:10.783 --> 31:15.150
So there is also all this.

31:15.130 --> 31:34.101
We know that quite immediately after the publication of the first part of Don Quixote, the two characters, Don Quixote and Sanso, were used as puppets or as elements within festivals included in Mexico or in Lima.

31:34.081 --> 31:39.090
And in the first, the gate of the first edition.

31:39.110 --> 31:40.393
He traveled over here.

31:40.413 --> 31:44.380
Yes, because the book traveled to America.

31:45.021 --> 31:52.495
And immediately, it was the first time, I think, in the history of literature that some characters were outside.

31:52.475 --> 32:10.185
of the printed pages to be embodied in the form of puppets of carnivalesque masks in different festivals, and not only in Spain, but also in Mexico or in Peru.

32:10.826 --> 32:14.191
And this is a great trend in the 18th century.

32:14.252 --> 32:17.537
You know how Richardson novels

32:17.517 --> 32:27.653
were commodified in format of engravings, wax, your display, your fans.

32:28.014 --> 32:40.674
And so we have also to think about the books outside of the book or the text outside of the book, which is very impressive and influential in this sense.

32:41.154 --> 32:44.540
Well, there's a play known to have been written by Shakespeare, which is what?

32:44.640 --> 32:45.381
Cardinio.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.624
Absolutely, indeed.

32:46.645 --> 32:52.793
One of the characters of the chapter in the Sierra Morena.

32:52.833 --> 32:53.574
Exactly.

32:53.594 --> 33:06.913
And it's a very wonderful, because I have worked recently about both, and so it's a wonderful and unexpected and sometimes unknown encounter between the Rantas and the Sierra works.

33:06.893 --> 33:10.457
Beyond the fact that they died the same year.

33:10.557 --> 33:10.817
Exactly.

33:10.837 --> 33:14.341
The same day, according to... Okay, more or less.

33:14.361 --> 33:16.784
Maybe they're 10 days different.

33:16.804 --> 33:19.146
Close enough, as we say.

33:19.827 --> 33:29.718
You are interested in what you call the popular reader, the common reader, but I wonder if looking at it from another angle, if, for instance, you were to go to St.

33:29.778 --> 33:35.584
Petersburg and look at the library there of Voltaire, for instance, would you know more about

33:35.564 --> 33:45.807
Voltaire the writer by knowing the books that he read, by knowing how his reading shaped his life as a creative individual.

33:45.867 --> 33:50.717
I just wonder if we could extend this to people like Gibbon.

33:50.737 --> 33:51.058
Yeah.

33:51.157 --> 33:56.083
and Sir Isaac Newton, all of these people who had extraordinary libraries.

33:56.604 --> 34:06.316
And of course, we don't know much about Shakespeare, but we can assume from the references in his plays, the books that he undoubtedly had read.

34:06.677 --> 34:15.428
Do you think that as a general concept, you could know more about the creative person by knowing their reading?

34:15.608 --> 34:20.995
I think so, particularly in period in which

34:20.975 --> 34:33.993
To compose an original work does not mean, and quite the contrary, that you were breaking with sources, references, materials.

34:34.013 --> 34:48.332
And for people like Shakespeare or for people like Serrantes, it's clear that their genius, the singularity of their genius was profoundly rooted in this handling.

34:48.312 --> 34:58.882
books from which motives, excerpts, quotations were extracted.

34:59.223 --> 35:01.345
And so it's absolutely decisive.

35:01.645 --> 35:04.448
And you mentioned Gibbon over there also.

35:04.528 --> 35:12.136
It's very important because it's a way for resisting a temptation of a very disincarnated form of history of ideas.

35:12.856 --> 35:17.661
As if everyone has read every text that in

35:17.641 --> 35:20.506
point of time, and it's not true.

35:20.526 --> 35:35.613
And so to reconstruct genealogically how ideas were molded, examples were used, the references were known, it's absolutely fundamental.

35:36.054 --> 35:41.303
And in Voltaire we have this library and also the marginalia.

35:41.283 --> 36:00.059
And it transforms, it seems to me, the vision of what is a production of ideas no more considered as something which has wood without wood, without material, without, nurtured by nothing except genius of the thinker.

36:00.559 --> 36:10.648
And it's a way for relocating this production of ideas within the historical background is to look

36:10.628 --> 36:16.874
at what they have read, how they have read, how they have used, and sometimes misunderstood.

36:17.515 --> 36:30.728
And this is true both at the level you mentioned, great poets like Shakespeare or a philosopher like Walter, historian like Gibbon, but also at a more popular level.

36:31.008 --> 36:37.775
You remember that one of the more famous books about reading is a book by Carlo Ginzburg, The Worms and the Sheaves.

36:37.895 --> 36:39.657
And what is the main source?

36:39.637 --> 36:51.879
The way to which Menocchio the Miller is reinterpreting, displacing, misunderstanding, appropriating text he has read.

36:51.899 --> 37:02.438
Not so many as Voltaire, but the text he has read, the Fioretti della Bibbia, il Decamerone, perhaps on Alcoran.

37:02.418 --> 37:12.934
The Travel by Montville, all these texts are the elements from which he's constructing his cosmogony, his cosmology.

37:13.535 --> 37:25.793
And of course it's a wonderful example of the appropriation as reinterpretation, distortion, misunderstanding, and creation, invention.

37:25.773 --> 37:34.047
This model could be applied for different periods and for different kinds of readers.

37:34.428 --> 37:50.937
But it seems to me it's absolutely fundamental, not only for understanding the past, but also for transforming our ways of constructing the history of conception, ideas, theories, systems.

37:50.917 --> 38:07.858
avoiding this kind of universal conversation as if Voltaire has read all the text of the previous to him.

38:08.459 --> 38:18.612
No, he has read some specific text in different specific edition and he has made use of this reading for constructing the

38:18.592 --> 38:20.655
his own works.

38:20.895 --> 38:23.479
And then, of course, we can see how he made use of it, too.

38:23.539 --> 38:24.020
Absolutely.

38:24.260 --> 38:44.548
And in this case, we have the chance to have the possibility, like for Menocchio, to compare what is a text and the different author interpretation in the same time, and the uses made by Menocchio the miller or Walter the philosopher of the text they have read.

38:45.068 --> 38:48.073
That was a wonderful statement.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.014
Thank you very much.

38:49.034 --> 38:54.803
That was just precisely the kind of insight that I was looking for.

38:55.143 --> 39:02.875
Are you familiar with a report that was just issued here in the United States a few weeks ago, the National Endowment for the Arts report?

39:03.260 --> 39:07.327
on the decline of readership, particularly in novels and poetry.

39:07.347 --> 39:13.276
Not in detail, but I have learned something about this.

39:13.577 --> 39:23.833
It seems to hit a lot of the points that you've hit, and I'm thinking particularly about your essay, The Death of the Reader, and you talk also about a new illiteracy.

39:24.252 --> 39:28.238
And is this something that you are fearful is developing?

39:28.378 --> 39:31.462
Is there a new... Yes.

39:31.723 --> 39:49.028
My fear is against... It's created by the discrepancy between, on the one hand, a discourse, a discourse according to which the new technologies, a new form of inscription of communication of the text...

39:49.008 --> 39:51.811
could be sort of universal.

39:51.871 --> 39:58.578
There is no more frontiers, barriers, obstacles.

39:58.938 --> 40:13.834
The circulation of the textuality thanks to the net is open to everyone because technically it is a possibility offered.

40:13.814 --> 40:29.477
But at the same time, when you look at different statistics, you see that the reality of this is the increasing and not the reduction of inequalities.

40:29.457 --> 40:40.900
Two or three years ago, perhaps it was like a chance now, but two or three years ago, 50 percent of the electronic addresses were located in English-speaking countries.

40:41.421 --> 40:50.520
And so there is no statistic which is more clear for demonstrating the unevenness and inequalities in the access.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.582
of this new technology.

40:52.642 --> 41:08.741
So you have this tension between the discourse of universality, which is technically rooted, and the observation about the distribution, access, users of this new form of literacy.

41:09.121 --> 41:15.208
And here is the risk of new illiteracy, not only at the scale of the planet,

41:15.492 --> 41:39.974
between the part of the world and another part of the world, but also in each given society, with the possibility that people absolutely able to read and write could be left behind, if I can say, but outside of these systems of production, communication, and appropriation of text.

41:39.994 --> 41:45.499
And here there is something which is not a fear, but which is a challenge.

41:45.479 --> 42:10.015
and the different authorities, political economy or the public opinion, have to take into account this risk of the increasing of discrepancy within the world which is described every time as more uniform, more global, more universal.

42:10.456 --> 42:13.140
I think this is very worrying.

42:13.120 --> 42:29.179
There's one quote I saw of yours, which I thought was wonderful, and I think you've touched on it here, and maybe we can conclude with it, because I think we've covered a lot of—actually, there are two other questions I want to ask, but let's just do this one first.

42:30.160 --> 42:38.790
You say that one thing you can't do with Historia Duluth is answer all the questions, but you certainly can raise the right questions.

42:39.057 --> 42:55.648
And I just love that idea that, sure, we can't answer all the questions, but if we know which questions to consider, then we're going in the right direction, I think, at least, and we're striving towards an understanding of what we're trying to accomplish here.

42:55.628 --> 43:11.728
Yes, it's the case with this reflection about the present, because often you have this idea that the electronic revolution has to be compared with the Gutenbergian revolution.

43:12.248 --> 43:17.755
And so I think it's wrong, because as you said previously,

43:17.735 --> 43:28.889
The use of the word book is for us very tricky because in general we say book identified as the printed text.

43:28.909 --> 43:37.099
And I quote during our conversation the book by Favre and Martin, The Coming of the Book.

43:37.119 --> 43:43.207
It's a very good book with a very bad title because Gutenberg didn't invent the book, of course.

43:43.667 --> 43:45.750
And he didn't even invent it.

43:45.983 --> 43:52.490
the book in the format in which the printed texts were circulated.

43:52.510 --> 44:02.902
We have books from antiquity, and we have codecs from the second, the third, and the fourth century after Christ.

44:03.122 --> 44:04.904
And the Chinese had printed books.

44:05.124 --> 44:05.504
Exactly.

44:05.545 --> 44:08.027
So everything is wrong with the coming of the book.

44:08.328 --> 44:11.451
But I say this because if you are starting with this,

44:11.431 --> 44:19.642
you can see that the comparison between the electronic revolution and the invention of the printing press is not the right one.

44:20.643 --> 44:27.713
It would be more accurate to compare the invention of the electronic revolution with the invention of the codex.

44:27.753 --> 44:40.290
That is to say an invention, a transformation, which transforms the form and the structure of the objects which were convened.

44:40.557 --> 44:46.686
The textuality, Gothenburg, didn't change anything from this point of view.

44:46.846 --> 45:01.789
A manuscript codex and a printed codex are the same morphological identity and nature, where, yes, if you have a role and if you have a codex or if you have a book, as we know,

45:01.769 --> 45:19.713
And if you have a screen here, we have a very important transformation, particularly with consequences about the reading practices, the posture of the reader, the capacity or the possibility or impossibility for entering into the text, and so on.

45:20.013 --> 45:24.118
So you see, here it could be a contribution of historical perspective.

45:24.178 --> 45:30.747
It's not to solve the question, it's not to predict the future, but it's to perhaps sometimes

45:30.727 --> 45:38.420
go beyond evident, immediate discourse.

45:38.440 --> 45:51.743
And to see, I conclude on this point, it seems to me that if you do this you can underline the profound originality of the revolution of the electronic textuality for the first time.

45:52.184 --> 45:56.211
We have no more this linkage between an object

45:56.427 --> 46:09.972
And the text, a codex, a roll, a printed book, a manuscript book, are always objects which are different from others and which are conveying a text or a series of texts.

46:10.373 --> 46:18.368
And so materiality of the text and textuality of the object are absolutely directly connected where it is.

46:18.348 --> 46:32.964
With the electronic revolution, of course, the screen is the only object, with quotation marks, conveying all types of discourse, from the more private email to the more public website.

46:33.124 --> 46:40.893
And here are launched, it seems to me, the main challenges we have to confront.

46:40.993 --> 46:45.638
That is to say, the necessity to think about the textuality

46:46.428 --> 47:00.535
disconnecting it from the different materialities which were constituting the written and manuscript and print culture in the past.

47:00.555 --> 47:05.044
And so it couldn't be an example for what is useful to

47:05.243 --> 47:13.136
in a reflection organized according an historical perspective.

47:14.559 --> 47:23.954
In the book, The History of Reading in the West, you describe, and your colleague on page 30, you describe Montagna as a singular reader.

47:24.115 --> 47:26.779
I wonder if you could tell me what you mean by that.

47:26.759 --> 47:31.608
Yes, because it's coming back to our point about how to write an history of reading.

47:34.594 --> 47:43.751
If you look, in this case we have, it's a privileged case, because on one side, on your hand, we know what is the humanist technique of reading.

47:44.011 --> 47:48.540
I try to describe very rapidly as a commonplace technique.

47:48.881 --> 47:49.662
You read.

47:49.642 --> 47:56.813
You make the marginalia, you extract, you copy in a commonplace book, you reuse.

47:57.654 --> 48:01.840
And we know that Shakespeare was using this technique.

48:01.860 --> 48:13.278
Some scholars have shown how he was using a kind of this commonplace books in order to take immediately, example, quotations, sentences, and so on.

48:13.698 --> 48:14.620
So you have this.

48:14.800 --> 48:18.065
This is the dominant humanist model for reading.

48:18.325 --> 48:18.906
Montaigne.

48:19.173 --> 48:21.936
He's not doing this at all.

48:21.956 --> 48:28.484
So perhaps the more humanist the writer is, the less humanist in the sense of the technique of the common places.

48:28.905 --> 48:30.487
He has no common places.

48:30.967 --> 48:41.620
He didn't write marginalia according to the rules, but he wrote at the end of his book a general comment and appreciation of what he has read.

48:41.640 --> 48:46.366
He didn't read during the night.

48:46.846 --> 48:48.268
All what he described

48:48.248 --> 49:01.279
of himself as a reader is opposed to what was characteristic of a humanist, scholar, erudite reader.

49:01.679 --> 49:03.203
And so here you can play.

49:03.537 --> 49:12.695
between the individuality, which is all very creative, inventive, and the norms, the code, the convention.

49:13.036 --> 49:17.144
And if you do this, you have another perception of Montaigne.

49:17.284 --> 49:22.474
He is a humanist, of course, in a philosophical sense, but he is not.

49:22.454 --> 49:41.053
in the more technical sense of the humanist techniques of reading, because he wants to read for his pleasure, for writing a book which is in many manner similar to the humanist literature, and so on.

49:41.414 --> 49:43.816
So he's a wonderful example for us.

49:43.916 --> 49:50.503
I think it's a good example for the tension between the individual and the collective.

49:50.635 --> 50:11.293
Just one question, and it's really not related to much of what we've written, but when we talk about how a text awaits its reader, I think of the great Russian novels, which were written at a time when perhaps as many as 80% of the Russian population were illiterate, and yet they still...

50:11.797 --> 50:14.681
wrote some of the most extraordinary works of fiction ever.

50:16.303 --> 50:20.428
How does that figure, I wonder, into a concept of a history of reading?

50:20.789 --> 50:27.878
If these books appeared in a place where the vast majority of people were unable to receive them?

50:27.998 --> 50:29.921
Or is this relevant to what we're talking about?

50:29.961 --> 50:30.501
I don't know.

50:30.642 --> 50:33.265
No, I think it's...

50:33.633 --> 50:38.321
It's interesting, because it's a very complex dynasty.

50:38.401 --> 50:41.186
You have no expertise for the Russian case.

50:42.709 --> 50:48.198
But if you think about Don Quixote, there is something comparable.

50:48.298 --> 50:54.409
The level of illiteracy in Golden Age Spain was very high.

50:54.389 --> 50:56.798
don't know how to read or to write.

50:56.818 --> 51:00.029
So it's illiterate within the novel.

51:00.170 --> 51:06.593
And nevertheless, immediately, as I said, the novel by Cervantes,

51:06.792 --> 51:10.318
Transcended its geography.

51:10.539 --> 51:13.384
I think maybe it's the same case with the Russian novels.

51:13.524 --> 51:14.486
I think so.

51:14.626 --> 51:16.750
You have forms of mediation.

51:17.612 --> 51:23.603
And you have forms of circulation of the text beyond the text.

51:23.663 --> 51:26.488
Not only because at the time, reading aloud.

51:26.468 --> 51:31.395
was very familiar practices.

51:32.096 --> 51:40.327
And reading aloud is a way for communicating a text to people who are illiterate or not able to read very friendly.

51:41.248 --> 51:43.591
So it's a way for communicating the text.

51:43.651 --> 51:51.582
And we know that in Golden Age Spain, and I suppose in Russian late 19th century, second half of the 19th century, this practice.

51:51.562 --> 51:54.185
was very, very important.

51:54.205 --> 52:10.862
And you have also the fact that for certain texts they enter into a kind of collective inheritance, and they were conveyed even if the people have not read or not read entirely the text.

52:10.922 --> 52:19.932
You can see the same thing with the great famous text from the French literature here in the context in which the school was developing literacy.

52:19.912 --> 52:39.963
People have not read entirely many of the Hugo novels, but they were known thanks to excerpts with the forms of reductions, abridgments, and so on.

52:39.983 --> 52:45.632
So we have to think particularly about this novel, which becomes emblematic.

52:45.865 --> 53:04.482
of a literature, a national literature, to think not only on the text as such, but all the forms which were conveying the text beyond the text, of course in altered forms, but nevertheless creating a familiarity with the text.

53:04.462 --> 53:33.220
And an example, in the late 18th century or beginning of 19th century America, the novels by Richardson were known not according to the lengthy and perhaps for some time boring epistolary novels, but were circulated with very short narratives which abandoned the epistolary form, which rewrites

53:33.200 --> 53:40.649
the story as a story and which make a kind of compact Pamela or compact Clarissa.

53:40.729 --> 53:41.590
I didn't know that.

53:41.610 --> 53:43.773
It's a good example of this.

53:44.554 --> 53:53.385
But because there was a difficulty to find a market, Benjamin Franklin published it in Philadelphia.

53:53.365 --> 53:56.551
a copy of Pamela, but it was a failure.

53:57.493 --> 54:02.002
The book was too long, and it was not the longest of the Richardson novels.

54:02.023 --> 54:09.197
And so immediately, for the more popular readership, there was this form of abridgment.

54:09.177 --> 54:24.992
which were transforming both the genre from epistolary novel to storytelling, and also the dimension from very heavy in quarto to very short chart book.

54:24.972 --> 54:31.122
Just briefly, I'll just conclude with a quick comment because it doesn't bear on something you just said.

54:31.502 --> 54:43.521
Just a few months ago on June 16th, which is Bloomsday, right, all over the world, that incident in James Joyce's Ulysses, and they say this is the most celebrated literary event in the world.

54:44.058 --> 54:48.865
And where perhaps 95 percent of the people who are celebrating have never read the novel.

54:49.206 --> 54:50.167
Yes.

54:50.928 --> 54:57.598
You know, in 18th century France, many people knew Rousseau and have never read a line by Rousseau.

54:57.618 --> 55:02.586
And so it's another phenomenon we could try to understand.

55:02.666 --> 55:05.290
And it's not only the text beyond.

55:05.270 --> 55:09.758
the book, but also the author substituted to the text.

55:09.778 --> 55:30.973
And so there was, it would be a very complex question, but it seems to me that at least from the 18th century on, you have what a French literary critic called the sacre de l'écrivain, the writer as sacred, both with the reference to the religious sacrality and also the reference to the

55:30.953 --> 55:32.876
the king.

55:33.497 --> 55:50.768
And so some figure in the late 18th century, Rousseau 19th century ago, and many authors of the 20th century had acquired this, a kind of visibility of popularity which was beyond

55:50.748 --> 55:55.760
The text is not read or not entirely read or known very, very vaguely.

55:55.800 --> 56:05.483
And so it would be a new figure of the authors which was endowed, in a sense,

56:05.682 --> 56:29.715
by this sacrality of the politics or of the religion would be a form of, according to the point of view, of secularization of literature, of secularization of religiosity, or of a form of literarization of the sacred.

56:29.695 --> 56:35.004
I think Joyce is probably a perfect example of that, because how many people have read that novel?

56:35.105 --> 56:36.046
Yeah, no.

56:36.186 --> 56:38.090
Everybody knows about it.

56:38.410 --> 56:41.235
Listen, Professor, I've taken an hour of your time.

56:41.396 --> 56:41.836
Thank you.

56:41.856 --> 56:43.159
I just can't thank you enough.

56:43.640 --> 56:46.965
I hope some material will be useful for you.

56:47.306 --> 56:48.007
It will be.

56:48.147 --> 56:52.295
And you can make me speaking real English.

56:52.335 --> 56:53.577
Well, if you want...

56:53.557 --> 56:57.022
To look at some of the quotes that I use, I'm happy.

56:57.042 --> 56:59.346
Yes, you can send my mail, and I can do that.

56:59.546 --> 57:02.010
You're coming back here, I guess, in the spring, is that right?

57:02.030 --> 57:03.652
Absolutely, it's mid-January.

57:03.672 --> 57:04.734
So that's fine.

57:04.834 --> 57:09.982
And if you email me your address, I'll send you some copies of... Yes, I have you.

57:10.142 --> 57:14.508
I can show to one of your... And I'd love for you to... Okay.

57:14.789 --> 57:16.171
Thank you so much for your time, sir.

57:16.411 --> 57:16.852
Thank you.

57:16.892 --> 57:17.493
Bye-bye.

57:17.513 --> 57:19.035
Have a good time with your book.

57:19.256 --> 57:22.180
Bye-bye.
