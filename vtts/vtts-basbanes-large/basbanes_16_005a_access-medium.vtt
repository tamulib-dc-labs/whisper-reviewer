00:03.338 --> 00:06.202
Say something.

00:06.302 --> 00:06.562
Yes.

00:06.582 --> 00:08.205
What is the fidelity in this thing right here?

00:08.265 --> 00:09.326
Can we hear with this?

00:11.689 --> 00:13.432
Just try it out.

00:13.452 --> 00:14.613
Test one, two, three, four.

00:14.633 --> 00:23.686
Test, test, test, test, test.

00:25.048 --> 00:29.093
One more one.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.806
Very good.

00:32.447 --> 00:38.938
Very good, let's hear it.

00:39.799 --> 00:55.384
That's a fiction of words to me and I get anything.

00:56.579 --> 01:04.070
The length of which my novel about this character has been on the full receipt is a little bit referring to me as well as Caroline.

01:05.893 --> 01:14.566
I can only think that rabbit, such as arrival in my prose over 30 years ago, has been for me a way in, into the matter of America.

01:15.748 --> 01:17.170
When I'm in his head,

01:17.352 --> 01:20.755
and I am riding them, so to speak.

01:20.795 --> 01:32.225
The tales of envisioned American landscapes and cityscapes take on for me an interest or flow of poetry of importance they do not have when I look at them with my own eyes.

01:33.426 --> 01:47.258
For he is, and has always been, a kind of man I am not, an athletic hero of heroic youth who, having lived back to the body, though it represents tired and old before his time.

01:48.149 --> 01:57.878
But through his possibly narrow perceptions and his instinctive present tense, the great elusive nation all around us offers itself to be funneled and be candid.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.662
So at least I have found it.

02:01.682 --> 02:10.190
Those who do not find this character and his will possibly viable resist or sniff, no doubt.

02:11.411 --> 02:15.355
The point I wish to worry is not whether our spirit is

02:15.588 --> 02:26.965
covered as a war, but what America does, though all the fiction written and all the fiction years being trained in colleges, seem to remain opaque or vaporous.

02:28.347 --> 02:34.697
How many of our classics, notoriously, deal not with American society, but its asocial margins?

02:35.678 --> 02:43.570
A whale hunt on the high seas, a refugee boy, a black slave on a river raft, the outcast, tested crimp,

02:43.938 --> 02:53.128
the expatriate heroes of Hemingway and Henry James, seeking fulfillment and aesthetic satisfaction everywhere but at home in the United States.

02:54.730 --> 02:58.574
One can make too much of this, but assume it is somewhat true.

02:59.354 --> 03:00.936
What might the reasons be?

03:02.017 --> 03:04.380
Let me propose four.

03:06.062 --> 03:12.949
One, with exceptions like Watkins and Irving and Wood and Dean Howells, who tend to bore austerity.

03:13.165 --> 03:27.661
The American writer has few traditional ties to the power establishment of the country, and ordinarily distrusts and scorns its politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats, managers, and even its workers.

03:28.462 --> 03:42.278
All those, in short, who make the society go are dismissed by a puritan idealism that seeks to compromise with end maneuvers of striving actuality as unworthy of sympathetic consideration.

03:43.658 --> 04:05.033
Two, the ideal of a classical society, in which there is no aristocracy, no peasantry, no certain class, in a perverse way makes us less accessible to one another by depriving our imaginations of those colorful badges and mannerisms and assigned duties with which characterization can begin.

04:06.916 --> 04:09.480
Three, the very triumph.

04:09.967 --> 04:21.521
of American popular culture in this century coats the individual whom the writer would hold up to cultural study in an impervious skin of cultural cliché.

04:22.422 --> 04:39.923
The crises of will and desire that occupy 19th century novels are, as it were, kidded away by the image-faturated modern consciousness, which has pre-experienced everything in the trivializing and building abundance of unearned sophistication

04:40.747 --> 04:46.453
This weariness of knowingness was wonderfully captured in the fiction of the late Donald Barberman.

04:48.115 --> 04:56.324
And for, perhaps a culture that never had a classic or meaningful epoch doesn't need one much to say about being human.

04:57.666 --> 05:10.500
When, in a nation soundly founded on 18th century rationalism and 19th century laws of material exchange, almost Haitians have been stripped of superstitious loyalties and quixotic delusions

05:11.054 --> 05:26.234
What is left is a bald consumer, an animal of purely selfish appetites and purely biological motives whose genetically determined life events scarcely warrant the glamorization of fiction.

05:26.254 --> 05:35.486
For whatever reason, America remains something of a riddle to the practitioners of fiction, a tougher nut to crack than you would think.

05:36.948 --> 05:40.032
Several able journalists

05:40.872 --> 05:55.251
advise us simply to seize the beast by the horns, do some research, and conduct a few interviews, and lay out the facts in lively Zola-esque fashion.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.075
And of course, facts should be collected.

05:58.115 --> 06:00.238
It's going to shake some people up.

06:00.258 --> 06:02.361
It's going to really rock some people.

06:02.381 --> 06:06.306
Because it just goes to absolutely the heart of what's going on in our country.

06:06.826 --> 06:25.830
in many many ways and it's symbolized for these horses and how they're treated and how they live and what their struggle is about and uh it's a huge i don't think universal has any idea what they're sitting on they're sitting on a huge story here so

06:25.810 --> 06:27.432
Yes.

06:27.532 --> 06:31.156
I'm real excited.

06:31.316 --> 06:38.684
I just did a week in Nevada, you know, and it's just mind boggling.

06:38.784 --> 06:39.565
Mind boggling.

06:39.645 --> 06:41.487
How do you personalize the title?

06:41.507 --> 06:51.018
You've got the great visual elements of the horses and stuff, and what's being done with them, but what's the human element?

06:51.038 --> 06:54.822
Well, the human element for me is...

06:54.802 --> 07:05.315
I like to write about situations that are simple, that involve one person and their dilemma.

07:05.395 --> 07:11.403
Now, there may be people that are satellites around that person, but generally just one figure.

07:11.803 --> 07:22.176
And what I try to do is I try to make it so that you kind of live the story through that person, and that's how I try to personalize it.

07:22.156 --> 07:24.139
How do you see it visually, though?

07:24.179 --> 07:36.739
Because you are thinking about... You mean with books or with... Well, no, because you're thinking about... I suspect you're thinking about pictures primarily.

07:36.759 --> 07:37.820
Is that right?

07:38.141 --> 07:38.882
Well...

07:39.098 --> 07:39.539
No.

07:40.300 --> 07:44.487
I'm thinking about fiction all the time, too.

07:45.028 --> 07:52.580
I see everything visually.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.443
I see everything in pictures in my head.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.710
The Mustangs?

07:58.893 --> 08:02.436
Well, every case is different, a little bit different.

08:02.456 --> 08:08.242
In the case of the Mustangs, I saw right away that there was something here that needed to be addressed.

08:09.383 --> 08:16.289
That's right away what made me interested in the idea of doing it, is because there's something that needs addressing.

08:16.389 --> 08:18.631
And I like to write about things like that.

08:18.691 --> 08:21.474
So that attracted me initially.

08:22.174 --> 08:27.499
And then the idea that I could...

08:27.800 --> 08:33.108
I didn't want to do it because I didn't like the setup.

08:33.128 --> 08:35.332
So I didn't want to do it.

08:35.412 --> 08:38.277
And they came to me and they said, I'll tell you what we will do.

08:38.297 --> 08:44.807
We would like for you to consider being executive producer and have a real share in this movie.

08:44.827 --> 08:48.593
And I said, no, I'm really interested in what you're talking about.

08:48.573 --> 08:55.284
And we went to several different studios and none of them wanted to pay me.

08:55.304 --> 09:00.954
They had the People Magazine article on the wild horse killings a couple of years ago.

09:00.974 --> 09:05.161
They come in waving this article saying we got the rights to this somehow.

09:05.481 --> 09:08.286
Yeah, the Sun Founder story.

09:08.637 --> 09:12.523
That's how producers work.

09:12.963 --> 09:15.447
They just see the newspaper.

09:15.507 --> 09:19.293
They run down after Farrah Fawcett or somebody.

09:19.373 --> 09:22.598
And some work and some don't.

09:22.618 --> 09:24.601
But it's a big, giant crapshoot.

09:24.621 --> 09:26.604
I think it's even bigger than publishing.

09:26.624 --> 09:32.653
Well, in terms of money, but I mean in terms of

09:32.633 --> 09:36.860
even the risk, because nobody knows, see?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.547
And everybody kind of thinks they do, but nobody does.

09:40.907 --> 09:44.293
So you're sitting in a room and nobody knows who's holding the aces.

09:44.313 --> 09:47.619
You've got all these people around here, and it's a bluff.

09:47.639 --> 09:49.562
The whole thing's a bluff, you know?

09:49.542 --> 09:56.233
That's why Kevin is so great in Hollywood.

09:56.273 --> 09:59.759
He's a poker player.

10:00.019 --> 10:01.762
He's a natural poker player.

10:01.782 --> 10:06.650
I don't know if he even plays poker, but that's what his psyche is.

10:07.191 --> 10:07.832
Oh, yeah.

10:07.852 --> 10:08.734
He won't blink.

10:09.034 --> 10:09.976
He won't blink.

10:10.036 --> 10:14.503
See, poker is an American game, as is crap, by the way.

10:14.770 --> 10:15.772
It's true.

10:15.792 --> 10:31.777
Well, you know I'm well enough to be able to key in on that.

10:32.338 --> 10:36.405
How does this start?

10:36.425 --> 10:39.690
I mean, this is how big it starts.

10:39.790 --> 10:40.131
Dances?

10:40.712 --> 10:40.812
Yeah.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.736
How did dances start?

10:43.876 --> 10:51.367
Dances started because I was interested in the history of my country.

10:51.827 --> 10:53.910
Just interested in it.

10:53.930 --> 10:57.215
So I started to read about it, about that particular era.

10:58.236 --> 11:03.163
And the more I read about it, the more intrigued I became.

11:03.223 --> 11:09.972
And I like to say that at one point what happened was my heart kept breaking.

11:10.340 --> 11:19.313
and it would repair itself, and I'd go back to it, and finally my heart just filled up so much that it overflowed, and that's what came out of it.

11:20.815 --> 11:26.604
But when we project what happened, you know, in terms of the movie, is this anything that you projected?

11:26.624 --> 11:27.846
Oh, God, no.

11:27.926 --> 11:35.096
Listen, people ask me this question more and more now, but that's okay.

11:35.117 --> 11:38.862
There's a good answer for it I've formulated now, which is that

11:39.770 --> 11:43.774
The best way I know how to explain it is that sure you have dreams.

11:43.854 --> 11:45.496
You have dreams of doing everything.

11:45.816 --> 11:47.918
Everybody has all these dreams.

11:48.038 --> 11:51.702
I'm not curious what was on your mind when you did it.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.424
What were you trying to achieve?

11:53.464 --> 12:00.711
No, just when this whole thing, they perceived this thing and they thought about what it was doing.

12:00.771 --> 12:03.634
Never mind Kevin Krasner in the movie.

12:03.654 --> 12:06.257
Just when you sat down, were you trying to just make a statement?

12:06.337 --> 12:07.178
Were you trying to...

12:07.428 --> 12:17.564
Did you have any idea that you would be now in New York and that you would be up at 25 or 35 Academy Awards or whatever it is?

12:18.145 --> 12:19.086
I can tell you what I knew.

12:19.126 --> 12:23.433
I thought that I had a story that I was enjoying writing.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.156
It doesn't happen to every writer.

12:25.376 --> 12:26.298
You know that.

12:26.318 --> 12:28.060
No.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.541
I know that.

12:29.162 --> 12:31.005
I had a story I was enjoying writing.

12:30.985 --> 12:33.970
And I felt like it was a good story.

12:34.610 --> 12:46.268
But beyond that, I wasn't really trying to make a point, although I made a lot of them.

12:46.969 --> 12:52.217
It's kind of the way I tell stories, you know?

12:52.197 --> 12:54.320
I'm going to do these readings.

12:54.400 --> 13:01.832
Anybody that hears these readings, I'm going to read from a lot of different stuff that I'm doing, fiction-wise.

13:01.892 --> 13:09.384
You'll see I'm really interested in addressing things.

13:09.404 --> 13:14.712
Where does this spring from?

13:14.692 --> 13:20.022
Just give me a little bit of your background, what this brings from.

13:20.082 --> 13:21.705
Because I don't know any of your background.

13:21.765 --> 13:23.729
Yeah, who cares what this brings from?

13:23.749 --> 13:24.710
Dances with wolves?

13:24.731 --> 13:25.392
Yeah.

13:25.412 --> 13:25.873
Okay.

13:25.893 --> 13:27.375
I have a special dance.

13:27.395 --> 13:27.676
Okay.

13:27.696 --> 13:29.740
All right.

13:29.900 --> 13:30.401
Okay.

13:30.521 --> 13:30.962
All right.

13:31.448 --> 13:38.998
What's really interesting is when you read about the captive stories.

13:39.078 --> 13:58.823
And what's really wild about it is that what is documented on it, the percentage of white women that were taken by Indians that wanted to come back to their own society was pretty shocking.

14:00.423 --> 14:04.277
for its smallest.

14:04.699 --> 14:09.336
And you didn't get the same...

14:09.569 --> 14:16.377
feeling any Indians that have been kidnapped by whites wanted to stay where they were.

14:16.437 --> 14:17.619
They always wanted to return.

14:17.679 --> 14:18.920
So how do you counsel them?

14:19.321 --> 14:22.404
Well, I think that they had something going.

14:22.424 --> 14:25.088
And I think that their principles are applicable today.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.294
Well, a lot of different things.

14:30.374 --> 14:38.884
I think one of the things that's really great that they had going was that they didn't consider themselves superior to nature.

14:38.864 --> 14:44.634
They didn't consider nature something to be exploited or to be bent to their wills.

14:46.497 --> 14:52.346
Most of these Indian people were really proud that they were in partnership with nature.

14:52.366 --> 14:59.438
That's a principle that means real heavy application now.

14:59.418 --> 15:03.122
We're dreaming right now.

15:03.143 --> 15:27.552
We're dreaming that everything is just swell.

15:28.207 --> 15:43.212
this adventure is not for everyone

16:12.419 --> 16:21.211
What's wrong with her?

16:21.271 --> 16:31.204
She's a baby?

16:38.525 --> 17:04.599
Ready?

17:04.619 --> 17:04.959
Here we go, Barb.

17:04.979 --> 17:05.200
Here we go.

17:05.220 --> 17:05.460
There we go.

17:09.001 --> 17:33.976
Here we go!

17:33.996 --> 17:34.617
We're going down into a tunnel!

17:34.637 --> 17:35.278
And we're going to go right now!

17:40.743 --> 18:10.248
All right, Bob, here we go.

18:10.268 --> 18:10.328
OK.

18:18.340 --> 18:30.220
Whoo-hoo!

18:37.172 --> 18:37.353
Whoo-hoo!

18:37.373 --> 18:39.777
Whoo-hoo!

18:39.797 --> 18:39.977
Whoo-hoo!

18:48.007 --> 18:52.803
No!

18:58.463 --> 18:58.523
No!

19:24.355 --> 19:47.929
Are you kidding?

19:47.949 --> 19:49.011
That was better than the last time, wasn't it, Clark?

19:49.031 --> 19:49.131
Yeah.

19:53.465 --> 20:10.715
Is that something or was that something?

20:10.735 --> 20:16.465
That was something.

20:16.485 --> 20:16.585
Whoo.

20:16.605 --> 20:16.806
All right.

20:16.826 --> 20:17.126
All right, Bob.

20:17.146 --> 20:17.427
Let's get out.

20:17.447 --> 20:17.547
Whoo.

20:17.567 --> 20:17.667
Whoo.

20:19.402 --> 20:27.455
Was that something or was that something?

20:27.615 --> 20:33.684
What did you say now?

20:33.945 --> 20:36.549
Yeah, tomorrow.

20:36.569 --> 20:42.979
Yeah, I think maybe Nicole's a little too little to us.

20:42.959 --> 20:58.452
Remind my kind words that your constant is a life-supporting oxygen.

20:58.473 --> 20:59.635
It's not only that, but we are beginning to change itself.

21:00.914 --> 21:17.134
Oh, no, no, no.

21:17.114 --> 21:46.545
.

21:46.565 --> 21:46.585
.

21:46.605 --> 21:46.625
.

21:46.645 --> 21:46.665
.

21:54.863 --> 22:24.229
Hey, Bob, are you going to watch the parade or what?

22:25.981 --> 22:54.912
.

22:54.932 --> 22:54.952
.

22:54.972 --> 22:54.992
.

22:58.634 --> 23:22.099
Okay.

23:22.119 --> 23:22.440
Can I have some?

23:22.460 --> 23:22.920
Okay, it's right there.

23:26.731 --> 23:45.162
Thank you.

23:49.259 --> 24:11.723
Thank you.

24:13.998 --> 24:37.255
Say hi, Mickey.

24:37.275 --> 24:37.555
Hello, Mickey.

24:37.575 --> 24:37.856
Hello, Mickey.

24:37.876 --> 24:38.156
Hello, Mickey.

24:38.176 --> 24:38.457
Hello, Mickey.

24:38.477 --> 24:38.757
Hello, Mickey.

24:38.737 --> 25:07.647
yeah yeah

25:09.230 --> 25:38.528
No way.

25:44.009 --> 25:53.361
Thank you.

25:58.640 --> 26:24.466
.

26:24.486 --> 26:24.506
.

26:24.526 --> 26:24.546
.

26:24.526 --> 26:50.955
Oh, my God.

26:53.720 --> 27:15.968
.

27:15.988 --> 27:16.008
.

27:16.028 --> 27:16.048
.

27:20.602 --> 27:35.910
What?

27:41.780 --> 28:00.801
Oh, my God, my God, my God.

28:01.135 --> 28:22.182
Thank you.

28:29.148 --> 28:58.497
Oh, yeah.

29:01.885 --> 29:19.489
We will be, we will go.

29:26.978 --> 29:48.261
Thank you.

29:50.030 --> 30:17.122
.

30:17.142 --> 30:17.162
.

30:17.182 --> 30:17.202
.

30:18.700 --> 30:46.615
Thank you.

30:52.720 --> 31:14.357
Thank you.

31:15.046 --> 31:19.610
Quite frankly, to sit down with each and every one of them and devote their time as they like.

31:19.810 --> 31:24.675
They don't only run from people who are wanting to write a book themselves to make some bucks on it, which is fine.

31:25.296 --> 31:28.659
It's also lots of high school students who want to write it for their newspapers.

31:28.719 --> 31:30.781
And I just don't have the time to do it.

31:31.962 --> 31:34.644
It is going to be done this once.

31:35.525 --> 31:40.470
And it's going to be done because I was the one living it.

31:40.490 --> 31:43.973
And I think I could be the fullest view of what the campaign was about.

31:44.459 --> 31:53.748
And I think what we'll be able to say at the end is not only what can be meant for the country, but what it means for the future for women in politics, which I'll be dealing with as well.

31:54.349 --> 32:07.682
So whether or not it was Bantam saying to me, we don't want you to do it, or it was almost a relief that I do have that kind of a cause so that I can do what I have to do, get it out.

32:08.162 --> 32:13.808
And then people use the book any way they want, for their own research or for whatever.

32:14.193 --> 32:18.600
to tell their story, to give their views.

32:18.620 --> 32:24.148
Could you describe the actual process of writing, and how long you've had each other?

32:24.168 --> 32:24.488
Painful.

32:24.508 --> 32:24.709
Painful.

32:25.069 --> 32:34.062
It was Linda Franke and I started together in December, and we were between four and five hours.

32:34.323 --> 32:35.765
December of 84?

32:35.825 --> 32:37.007
I couldn't have done before that.

32:40.912 --> 32:43.356
I had to wait for November 6th.

32:43.673 --> 33:12.263
But we sat for four to five hours a day, just about five days a week whenever I was in the city, and talked about every aspect of the campaign from the selection process through the debate, through the financial stuff, through the situation with the Archbishop Cardinal O'Connor,

33:12.867 --> 33:21.115
We had, after we did that, we, Linda used, fortunately there wasn't already kept.

33:21.135 --> 33:26.481
It was kept in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and I don't know how many newspapers throughout the country.

33:26.941 --> 33:28.383
We took clips and used those.

33:29.164 --> 33:30.385
I went through them with her.

33:30.405 --> 33:35.150
I went through with her the schedules that I had, which we of course had.

33:36.011 --> 33:42.317
We had some tapes that I had made, some tapes my children had made.

33:42.652 --> 34:02.475
spoke to staff people who had participated in the campaign and used my speeches as well as legal briefs filed for me and various actions I was involved with after the election and used briefs filed for my husband.

34:03.075 --> 34:08.502
And so we've gotten substantive things that we've used.

34:09.523 --> 34:10.684
We haven't made up anything.

34:11.086 --> 34:16.171
It's all there, and we throw in the emotions.

34:18.473 --> 34:22.797
By the way, there's the rest of the physical part that, of course, she is working on the word processor.

34:22.877 --> 34:25.900
She submits the first draft to me, and I work on it.

34:27.342 --> 34:28.403
Cross out, put in.

34:29.364 --> 34:30.585
I'm not a professional writer.

34:30.805 --> 34:31.726
These people aren't shared.

34:32.607 --> 34:36.891
Though I was an English major in college, I did have a minor of journalism for a while, folks.

34:37.225 --> 34:39.528
but not good enough to do this on my own.

34:39.548 --> 34:45.196
And so Lynn and I have been working together, and then I've been working with the editor, and we'll be finished, hopefully, by July 1.

34:45.717 --> 34:52.066
In speaking before a group like this, do you comment at all in your book on the attention that the media gave you, number one?

34:52.206 --> 35:00.197
And number two is, in speaking before this room, do you comment on the media's attention and treatment for you and your husband?

35:00.217 --> 35:00.497
Sure.

35:00.718 --> 35:02.620
I do deal with the press.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.042
I don't deal with it in a separate chapter.

35:04.062 --> 35:05.384
I do it throughout the book.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.726
I do it, for instance, when we just

35:09.102 --> 35:15.128
I do it in a chapter called On the Road where we talk about what went on in various places.

35:15.328 --> 35:22.755
I discuss, I say, as I said today, that the traveling press I had was terrific.

35:22.795 --> 35:26.238
They were professionals who did their job.

35:26.258 --> 35:35.006
Part of the problem, beginning with me, I had difficulty adjusting from being a third-term member of Congress to being a national figure overnight.

35:35.026 --> 35:37.388
And I take some responsibilities.

35:39.950 --> 35:42.013
That wasn't a major concern.

35:42.173 --> 35:45.757
That wasn't the part that led to problems for any of us.

35:45.777 --> 35:49.642
I also deal with the New York Post Total Conquire.

35:51.324 --> 35:55.409
It is not a whining book, let me just tell you that.

35:55.589 --> 35:57.832
It is an up book.

35:58.413 --> 36:02.037
Because when all is said and done, when I said I don't regret it, I don't.

36:02.538 --> 36:04.320
There's a time when I was asked for this.

36:04.840 --> 36:08.526
And I used to say, as the mother of Donna and Laura, I absolutely have no regrets.

36:08.546 --> 36:10.530
But as Mrs. Johnson-Carroll, I'm not quite sure.

36:10.550 --> 36:15.639
And I said that at an event when my husband said that we have no regrets.

36:16.420 --> 36:17.061
So he doesn't.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.405
That he feels it was worthwhile.

36:20.668 --> 36:21.910
But I agree with that.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.412
But I feel honestly with that.

36:23.913 --> 36:24.975
I'd be honest with you in the book.

36:34.169 --> 36:37.112
Would your husband encourage you to go back in again?

36:38.233 --> 36:41.556
We haven't discussed the future.

36:41.837 --> 36:50.665
I'm looking at a possibility of a Senate run, but we haven't discussed it because I have not gotten to the point of really even doing polls yet.

36:51.346 --> 36:57.912
I'm trying to do one thing this time, which I'm finding is much tougher than I have to do.

36:57.932 --> 37:03.518
Did you mention the role of women in politics as you?

37:03.970 --> 37:08.716
Well, I discuss, you know, what it's like to be a woman candidate, for one thing.

37:09.457 --> 37:16.546
Things that were expected of me, things that, how the distress dealt with me, what people expected of me, how they responded to me.

37:17.708 --> 37:22.894
But I think one of the things, too, is that this type of candidate will not happen again.

37:23.335 --> 37:25.297
And that's one of the things that we're going to point out as well.

37:25.718 --> 37:29.443
That the next time a woman runs, she's going to be ready for it.

37:29.463 --> 37:31.986
She will have, perhaps, run into progress.

37:34.075 --> 37:40.603
I would venture a suggestion that in ADA you're going to see a couple of women in the primary.

37:41.244 --> 37:44.508
So that it would not be the same type of situation.

37:44.749 --> 37:47.773
It would not be all of a sudden, oh my god, look, this has happened.

37:47.793 --> 37:55.122
And so what I talk about are things that help people respond to things like clothes.

38:00.603 --> 38:01.745
You're not supposed to wear that.

38:01.845 --> 38:03.327
You sink into beige.

38:03.367 --> 38:04.429
You disappear.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.492
I mean, that type of thing.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.616
But, you know, we talk about this where it's likely a woman's bill.

38:11.098 --> 38:12.721
What is your dedication about telling?

38:12.741 --> 38:13.823
I'm not telling.

38:13.843 --> 38:20.152
I haven't written the dedication yet, but that's going to be a surprise for the individual I'm doing.

38:20.172 --> 38:24.298
How much of a completed manuscript has been handed in to Bantam at this point?

38:24.318 --> 38:27.463
Bantam has seen, I would say, 95% of it.

38:27.643 --> 38:29.766
We have one more chapter.

38:30.353 --> 38:30.894
That's it.

38:31.795 --> 38:34.500
That's female.

38:34.620 --> 38:38.707
First of all, I'd like to comment that your attitude is fabulous.

38:38.727 --> 38:38.928
Thank you.

38:39.148 --> 38:40.170
It's a fabulous attitude.

38:40.190 --> 38:43.836
Secondly, I think this is one of that coming I've ever seen.

38:43.856 --> 38:44.617
No, this is not female.

38:44.637 --> 38:45.759
Also female, if you have her name.

38:45.779 --> 38:48.624
Look, we can get it.

38:48.644 --> 38:51.850
It is really excellent.

38:51.870 --> 38:53.032
That's my mom.

38:53.112 --> 38:53.813
Isn't that pretty?

38:54.215 --> 39:03.108
In the book you said that, or in your talk this morning, you said that there was a great deal of emotional hurt.

39:03.248 --> 39:08.837
Do you get involved with the taxes and your husband in the book?

39:09.097 --> 39:10.038
I deal with everything.

39:10.779 --> 39:13.143
Yeah, there's a good deal of emotional hurt.

39:13.383 --> 39:20.834
There are parts of the book that when I was reading, I choked up much more physically than I ever choked up in the campaign because I wasn't a doctor then.

39:22.296 --> 39:23.378
But, yeah.

39:23.864 --> 39:27.528
What about life on the outside of college?

39:27.548 --> 39:30.731
Have there been any reactions?

39:30.751 --> 39:31.912
Yes, lots of reactions.

39:32.192 --> 39:33.834
Women love it.

39:33.854 --> 39:35.335
People come and say, I'm so glad you did it.

39:36.076 --> 39:43.663
And I think that when people have seen it, we got hit very hard because I think people jumped at it without having seen it.

39:43.683 --> 39:44.184
Have you seen it?

39:45.045 --> 39:46.526
It's really, I think, quite good.

39:46.546 --> 39:47.327
It does two things.

39:48.148 --> 39:52.352
It says women can be whatever they want to be, which is

39:52.872 --> 39:54.855
But I was talking about what my campaign meant.

39:55.756 --> 39:56.477
And that's so.

39:57.258 --> 40:02.386
But also, it talks about motherhood as being a very, very important career choice.

40:02.406 --> 40:19.431
And the reason we did that was we found that during the course of the campaign, women who were at home, either by choice or not by choice, because they were raising families, a good number of themselves, that what I had done was somehow putting their job down.

40:20.052 --> 40:22.035
And we wanted to make it clear that, you know,

40:23.416 --> 40:24.998
important if that's what your choice is.

40:25.338 --> 40:28.021
So no one has said that it's some kind of a shout-out?

40:28.041 --> 40:28.422
Oh, no.

40:28.642 --> 40:29.943
Not since people have seen it.

40:30.404 --> 40:33.467
I think there are people who still feel that way, aren't you?

40:33.507 --> 40:37.131
Obviously, they're not going to come to me and say, hey, you sold out.

40:38.132 --> 40:40.275
But the reaction that I had is very good.

40:40.415 --> 40:49.905
And the women cannot say, I'm just glad to be with you.

40:49.925 --> 40:50.386
No, you're still there.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.208
How has the acceptance action changed the majority of the ideas of what they wanted to do?

40:52.525 --> 41:08.223
No, part of the reason why that's not something we really worried about is that they use different names or not.

41:08.804 --> 41:10.005
My husband's name is Carol.

41:11.207 --> 41:17.514
But in addition to that, these are kids who have been achievers, you know, since they went to school and before that.

41:17.894 --> 41:21.098
You know, when Dr. Kozo taught that, he and I were discussing that earlier,

41:27.203 --> 41:31.569
She was three years old in reading.

41:33.051 --> 41:38.139
While I was a school teacher, and when you're home and that's what you're doing, you spend your time pushing your kids.

41:39.020 --> 41:45.710
And, you know, she has a leg up on a lot of other kids whose parents aren't capable of doing something like that.

41:45.730 --> 41:48.594
And we're talking about that as a parent issue.

41:48.854 --> 41:51.338
So our kids have been a teacher so long.

41:51.672 --> 42:01.769
The interesting thing that you ask about my doors, my three kids have always felt that they're going to do whatever they want to do, and they're going to be whatever they want to be, and they didn't need me to run to prove it to them.

42:01.789 --> 42:04.794
They're under that impression, and that's been fine.

42:04.814 --> 42:09.441
They've always known that they could be anything at least as great as their brother, and not better.

42:09.461 --> 42:10.763
I mean, they have a wonderful attitude.

42:10.783 --> 42:17.815
I've watched two sisters between the male, this poor male child in the middle in our household.

42:18.470 --> 42:21.858
The girls are going to go back in their own lives.

42:22.058 --> 42:24.724
Laura starts Brown in September.

42:25.205 --> 42:31.038
She still wants to be an actress, but thinks that what she will do is be a lawyer just to be safe and then she'll act on the side.

42:31.299 --> 42:38.014
And she thinks the Pepsi commercial is fine because she got a SAG card, which she was unable to get.

42:47.157 --> 42:49.359
He will do that.

42:49.379 --> 42:53.723
John has decided he's going to go into politics, which I think is dynamite.

42:53.783 --> 42:57.026
He had never thought of running for office before.

42:57.166 --> 42:59.509
He has got his life now in order.

42:59.529 --> 43:03.272
He's going to finish college, go to law school, and run for office.

43:03.292 --> 43:07.196
And he'll finish college, but he may run for office before he even goes to law school.

43:07.216 --> 43:09.438
He has decided he's going to be a politician.

43:09.458 --> 43:10.919
He's decided he's going to be an office owner.

43:10.939 --> 43:14.022
He's decided that he's going to speak up on issues and on places.

43:14.042 --> 43:16.084
But he's the only one who's decided in that direction.

43:16.840 --> 43:27.996
Can you tell us some of the keys to your success in reaching denominations and the general keys to your success in America as well?

43:28.016 --> 43:31.721
Well, if I had the keys to success, we would have won the election.

43:31.741 --> 43:34.445
I talk in the book about the selection process.

43:34.745 --> 43:41.895
The process was an unusual thing because it was not the normal.

43:42.756 --> 43:44.839
The way most people get chosen is vice president.

43:48.650 --> 44:16.108
the senate by having a track record by being governor of the state by um you know by running for the presidency that's how most people get to be vice president my selection was a little bit different i did not run for it but it turns out that during the course of the previous four years i've been doing the things that put me in a position to make me noticeable whether it was with the national committee the midterm conference the hunt commission and various other

44:19.109 --> 44:35.452
So those are pieces that came together, but it was not that I ran for a young run, not in the way I selected as you would actually run for the president.

44:35.472 --> 44:38.657
Well, I'm talking about the American dream sort of thing.

44:38.977 --> 44:43.564
What are some pieces of success in America today to reach success?

44:43.966 --> 44:46.589
generally, maybe in business and holidays or whatever.

44:46.709 --> 44:52.656
The big one, the big key is what goes out about this morning, education.

44:52.676 --> 44:53.618
And that's what was with me.

44:54.198 --> 44:59.444
And I've said on more than one occasion that I had an uncle when I was 16 who said to my mother, don't bother him.

44:59.565 --> 45:01.447
She was saying, you've sent me to college.

45:01.467 --> 45:01.907
She's pretty.

45:02.408 --> 45:03.009
She'll get married.

45:04.190 --> 45:04.491
I was.

45:05.251 --> 45:05.612
I did.

45:06.293 --> 45:10.418
But the thing is, that was the attitude then.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.540
And she just said, hey, listen, I didn't get an education.

45:12.660 --> 45:13.281
She's going to get it.

45:24.989 --> 45:30.635
That's why, again, I think the administration's policies are just so short-sighted, so unfair.

45:31.115 --> 45:35.339
We're reading out a whole segment of our population saying we can't do it.

45:35.359 --> 45:37.542
It says nothing to do with race or money.

45:37.562 --> 45:49.714
If you do not plan to run for president or vice president, I would like to know what other American women would you suggest to run for the next person?

45:50.420 --> 46:00.292
Well, let me say that there are lots of women who might be coming up who can take a run and do it on their own.

46:01.233 --> 46:04.637
Run for president, because you don't really run for vice president.

46:04.697 --> 46:07.020
As I said, you run for president.

46:07.660 --> 46:14.048
I say on the Democratic side, people moving, like Harriet Woodson, I'm sure will be the next senator from Missouri,

46:18.635 --> 46:20.917
exceptionally good job as the governor of that state.

46:21.818 --> 46:23.219
Madeline Kuhn is a brand new governor.

46:23.680 --> 46:28.324
She's had a good deal of public experience as the Senate governor.

46:28.344 --> 46:28.845
Very sharp.

46:29.125 --> 46:31.727
And knows where she's going and what things are down.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.329
We have some good women in the House, too.

46:33.869 --> 46:34.650
I mean, let's face it.

46:34.730 --> 46:37.213
Dick Gabbard can talk about running from the House for president.

46:37.273 --> 46:39.315
So can, you know, Patricia Schroeder or a few others.

46:40.115 --> 46:42.057
On a Republican side, I do that as well.

46:42.117 --> 46:46.161
Let me just say to you that some of my friends are Republicans.

46:51.676 --> 46:56.362
in 1984 by a large majority and has done a very, very admirable job at the United States at the different campus.

46:56.862 --> 47:01.188
Libby Dole, I think, is another possibility.

47:01.348 --> 47:03.430
Don't slip a coin and then have hope.

47:03.450 --> 47:04.892
It'll be interesting if Lisa's going to do it.

47:05.353 --> 47:07.235
But I think she's a possibility.

47:07.735 --> 47:09.357
And people talk about Jean Kirkpatrick.

47:10.038 --> 47:13.242
I think she's certainly very talented, very bright.

47:13.643 --> 47:19.810
I think she might have a little trouble going around and doing the things that you have to do in order to run, which is run.

47:20.228 --> 47:26.577
I'd shake hands with people and do lots of, you know, communicating with the rallies and stuff.

47:26.597 --> 47:34.990
I don't know if that's her personality, but, you know, we've got a lot of talented women in this country.

47:35.010 --> 47:41.259
Do you think that the country would like to see a woman as a vice president before she could go for the big one?

47:42.020 --> 47:42.401
I don't know.

47:42.661 --> 47:49.932
You know, I think when people run for vice president, I think most people have in their mind that if something were to happen to the president, that that person could be president.

47:50.452 --> 47:53.237
And that's how they judge.

47:53.277 --> 47:57.945
People, when they talked about it was not whether or not I could be vice president.

47:59.207 --> 48:04.256
It's an important job, but what are the decisions that you make?

48:04.276 --> 48:08.744
It was not whether or not I could be vice president or whether or not I could be president.

48:08.764 --> 48:11.529
And that was the test, whether or not I could stand up, too.

48:11.970 --> 48:15.396
Whether or not I'd have the courage to push a button or not push a button.

48:15.815 --> 48:24.210
whether or not I could deal with the Soviets, whether or not I would be able to address the problems in this country on the domestic side.

48:24.630 --> 48:26.754
I mean, those are the things we talked about.

48:26.794 --> 48:34.768
So that even if they're voting for a woman in a vice presidential spot, they're really considering whether or not should be able to run and be or do the job of president.

48:35.086 --> 48:47.559
I'd like to ask a question about the educational system.

48:47.579 --> 48:49.501
What are some of the things you think should be done in the same half of the educational system?

48:49.521 --> 48:56.468
You know, for one thing, I think what we're doing in this country is fine, which is giving the educational system to the individual states and the individual communities to run.

48:56.488 --> 49:03.996
I think it's very difficult to put a blanket rule on what's done in education, but I think that we have to deal with things like Head Start programs,

49:04.482 --> 49:12.310
I think that if you don't deal with that problem with the literacy that he's talking about, you know, it is a real problem.

49:13.771 --> 49:17.555
We had, when I was teaching, I had second and fourth graders.

49:19.077 --> 49:30.668
I had a fourth grade class where a child could read on a first grade level, and he had been left back a couple of times, so he's already 12, 13 years old.

49:30.688 --> 49:34.252
You tell me if he's going to read a book and speak to Jane and all that stuff.

49:34.272 --> 49:34.472
So I said,

49:37.237 --> 49:40.320
dealing with scores, because that's what he was interested in.

49:40.640 --> 49:45.926
I think what we have to do is we have to look at our kids' needs and go in and particularly deal with them.

49:45.986 --> 49:46.786
How do you deal with them?

49:47.327 --> 49:50.590
You've got to put some federal money into the program.

49:50.610 --> 49:52.232
Title I, what is Title I?

49:52.252 --> 49:57.057
It's now chapter I. You have head and start having real problems.

49:57.277 --> 50:01.781
You've got to use the kids in their middle and use that training through the system.

50:02.082 --> 50:05.505
I think also we've got to deal with education for colleges.

50:06.076 --> 50:19.431
We're cutting student loans, and we're putting people in the position where, sure, Donna's a carer who can go to Harvard because their parents can afford it, but it's not going to be available to a lot of other kids, middle class kids, and that's wrong.

50:19.852 --> 50:26.019
I mean, you know, as a mother, I'm delighted my kid has a life out, but it's wrong that she should have it because we can afford it.

50:26.039 --> 50:31.105
I mean, I don't know why she has it because she's worked for it and paid for it, and that's why she got it, and that's okay.

50:48.297 --> 50:52.823
A couple of months, what I've been focusing on is my thoughts on running Spice Press.

50:53.104 --> 50:57.089
I've been looking back for the past seven months.

50:57.710 --> 50:59.953
I will start looking forward in another month.

51:00.674 --> 51:03.258
You have no thoughts?

51:03.278 --> 51:03.338
No.

51:03.358 --> 51:04.700
I've thought, but not about that.

51:05.361 --> 51:11.790
Yes, in view of the results, I wonder if in your book you assess whether or not a woman on the ticket helped or hurt.

51:12.530 --> 51:18.000
I don't think we really do, but I spoke, it did not hurt, let me start off by telling you that.

51:18.200 --> 51:21.846
I spoke to, I think we do, I don't remember.

51:23.028 --> 51:23.810
Could you address yourself?

51:23.830 --> 51:30.542
I'm trying to figure out whether or not everything that I, everything I know about this campaign is totally in the book.

51:30.762 --> 51:35.871
What we did, what we found out was there are certain,

51:36.205 --> 51:37.386
It did not hurt.

51:37.547 --> 51:48.580
What we found at my time from Adam Klamer, this is what I'm not quite sure is in the book, who does poems in the New York Times, said to me that what we added in numbers as opposed, not a big deal, eight-tenths of 1%.

51:48.600 --> 51:53.085
When you're 18 points behind, it is not a big shake.

51:54.607 --> 51:56.269
But we did not take away.

51:56.309 --> 52:01.335
And the other piece of it is we added in different ways.

52:01.636 --> 52:06.121
Democratic Party now has 20,000 contributors it never had before.

52:06.141 --> 52:10.846
20,000 new contributors added to a list.

52:10.946 --> 52:14.990
We did fundraisers throughout the country and raised $6 million.

52:15.090 --> 52:18.093
Lots of new money.

52:18.774 --> 52:23.479
People who had never before contributed campaign all of a sudden got involved.

52:23.499 --> 52:25.962
And I'm not just talking about big bucks.

52:26.142 --> 52:29.145
I'm talking about a fundraiser in California where

52:29.294 --> 52:35.260
The great majority of people were waitresses that paid $65 a ticket to come and have breakfast with me.

52:35.280 --> 52:35.720
I didn't eat.

52:36.221 --> 52:36.661
They didn't eat.

52:37.262 --> 52:42.266
They really didn't have to pay me $65 to don't shake my hand because they could have done that outside because I was doing that outside, too.

52:42.847 --> 52:48.352
But for them, it was investment in what they believed we were doing for the future of the country.

52:48.372 --> 52:49.794
So in that way, we added.

52:49.814 --> 52:50.674
We had new contributors.

52:50.694 --> 52:51.435
We had new involvement.

52:51.896 --> 52:56.500
We also brought in volunteers, which I've been told

53:02.335 --> 53:08.427
And of course, I think the enthusiasm that we found in our rallies, that continued up until the last day.

53:08.527 --> 53:12.454
So no matter what, I mean, it gave it back to the campaign.

53:12.474 --> 53:13.657
It was not a war.

53:13.697 --> 53:20.189
Now, again, we deal with it, but I don't know if I specifically mentioned Adam Clymer and Nicole.

53:20.209 --> 53:21.772
I kind of doubt I mentioned by name.

53:22.794 --> 53:24.097
Last quick question.

53:24.277 --> 53:24.377
Yeah.

53:33.301 --> 53:37.466
I kind of, you know, I don't think so.

53:38.107 --> 53:43.434
The thing is, I think they're going to have a little trouble with, I mean, in New York State especially.

53:43.454 --> 53:44.816
I mean, my mayor wrote a book.

53:44.836 --> 53:45.597
It's now a play.

53:46.097 --> 53:47.659
My governor wrote a book.

53:47.679 --> 53:48.861
My governor wrote a book.

53:48.881 --> 53:53.246
I mean, you know, so how, you know, mercy is not.

53:53.306 --> 54:01.337
The other thing, too, is I think what happened was when people jumped at me, they really didn't realize that other people, men, have been doing commercials for a while.

54:01.978 --> 54:03.139
For instance, Howard Baker.

54:05.431 --> 54:19.426
quit as the senator in order to prepare for 1988 to run for the presidency, is now doing ads, and hasn't been doing since before I did the presidential, for USA Today.

54:20.107 --> 54:28.836
He not only does media, the electronic, but he does print ads, and he actually sells the newspaper.

54:29.557 --> 54:31.279
It's been said that he did not get paid for it.

54:31.319 --> 54:35.083
However, he is on the board of USA Today, and you don't do that for nothing.

54:35.519 --> 54:41.231
And in addition to that, it'll be interesting to see what they do with him in 1988.

54:41.752 --> 54:42.714
They are a newspaper.

54:42.734 --> 54:44.879
They do have an editorial endorsing policy.

54:44.899 --> 54:47.705
I have a little more problem with that than I have with Pepsi.

54:47.725 --> 54:52.796
I don't think Pepsi's going to endorse him if I decide to remember the president.

54:52.816 --> 54:53.738
And anyway, that's it.

54:53.818 --> 54:54.439
Thank you very much.

55:01.490 --> 55:08.776
Take care.

55:08.796 --> 55:09.559
Get your lead.
