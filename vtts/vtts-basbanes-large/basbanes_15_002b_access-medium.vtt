WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:17.984
He is the father of triple digit deficits.

00:18.004 --> 00:20.647
Do you think you will go down in history as such?

00:21.248 --> 00:26.033
It looks to me at the moment like I probably will, because they weren't corrected.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.916
We've had triple digit deficits.

00:28.936 --> 00:30.578
This will be the fifth year in a row.

00:31.132 --> 00:40.295
And even if Congress makes some modest little adjustments like they were talking about for next year, it's still going to be at minimum 150, maybe 200 when all is said and done.

00:41.237 --> 00:45.267
So it doesn't look very good.

00:45.287 --> 00:48.415
I guess I'm looking for more of a

01:00.275 --> 01:04.440
Well, I don't know how that I can wiggle out of it.

01:05.842 --> 01:08.886
I think the book demonstrates that the original plan was flawed.

01:08.906 --> 01:11.349
It was too optimistic on its economic assumptions.

01:11.369 --> 01:23.784
It was too ambitious in terms of trying to pier three or four years in the future, put a big tax reduction into place permanently, assume that the Senate and reductions were being made and would be made.

01:23.824 --> 01:30.012
And that sort of just radically unhinged the system.

01:30.329 --> 01:31.310
by August 1981.

01:31.350 --> 01:47.813
Now, I did spend four years in the trenches trying to get it corrected in any way I could, begging, pleading, even sort of bringing people along one way or another.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.296
And we did correct a little bit of the problem.

01:50.356 --> 01:53.400
Some people don't realize we did raise taxes four times after that.

01:53.420 --> 01:57.045
It wasn't because the supply siders were telling the president to do it, it was because Jim Bacon and I were.

01:57.599 --> 02:02.464
And it wasn't because the Republican partisans in the counties were telling the president to do it.

02:02.484 --> 02:03.285
They opposed it.

02:03.305 --> 02:13.317
It was just the solid middle leadership of Democrats and Republicans who kind of overpowered the White House and in the end confronted the president with a fade account lead.

02:13.337 --> 02:23.488
Now, that has reduced the deficit substantially, those four tax increases, by $100 billion a year compared to where we end up in the summer of 1981, way off the track.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.372
The fence has been scaled way back, too.

02:27.412 --> 02:33.840
Again, Congress just lowered the boom and said, sorry, Mr. President, sorry, Cap, you're not going to get that money and you can't afford it.

02:35.322 --> 02:40.868
I spent four years helping that to happen, so it could have been a lot worse.

02:41.109 --> 02:52.142
It's hard to imagine it could have been a lot worse, but if anybody does a careful counting of the numbers, then you will see that this coming year we

02:56.054 --> 02:58.497
So I think I accomplished something by staying on.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.020
But the result is still not very tolerable.

03:02.040 --> 03:09.208
You say that in about November, if I could give a specific date, November 12th, I think.

03:09.228 --> 03:11.690
That's when the— Yeah, that's right.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.033
He said, you know, it was doomed to fail.

03:14.433 --> 03:18.758
Yeah, why—I mean, why then stay on for five years?

03:18.778 --> 03:19.799
Well, because I've just described it.

03:19.839 --> 03:25.825
For the next four years, we whittled away at this damn thing and substantially reduced

03:26.041 --> 03:29.546
what otherwise would have been truly catastrophic deficits.

03:29.946 --> 03:33.731
Right, but wasn't this more or less a case of shoveling, you know, what against the tides?

03:33.751 --> 03:34.813
Yeah, but it made a difference.

03:34.953 --> 03:46.588
I mean, you don't like to get into numbers, but the fact is, in 1987, federal revenues will be $100 billion higher than if we had done nothing from November 12, 1981 on.

03:47.369 --> 03:49.952
That didn't happen by immaculate conception.

03:49.993 --> 03:54.158
The president dug in his heels and was opposed to it every step away, but we finally

03:54.678 --> 03:57.282
by one way or another got him to sign those bills.

03:58.123 --> 04:08.758
Nobody in the Congress wanted to do it among the partisans, but there were responsible people, like Danny Rostenkowski and Bob Dole and even Tip O'Neill.

04:08.778 --> 04:18.232
When push came to shove, he didn't have to rescue the president's chestnuts, but he supplied the Democratic majorities to pass these tax bills, and the president has never even recognized it.

04:18.252 --> 04:20.635
He's still beaten up on Congress day after day.

04:21.087 --> 04:30.659
when he had produced a catastrophe and didn't know it, and then the Congress rescued working with people like myself and Baker in the administration.

04:30.679 --> 04:34.323
At least mitigated the disaster that had occurred.

04:34.363 --> 04:46.858
That's why it stayed for four years, and I didn't write a lot about that in the book, because I figured, one, people understood that it happened, and second, I wanted to explain what happened in 1981 that caused

04:47.783 --> 04:52.690
well-intended, high-minded, idealistic plan to turn into a total mishap.

04:53.972 --> 04:56.335
Were you naive, do you think?

04:57.437 --> 05:06.349
No, I don't think so, because I spent four years in Congress, and I knew they were against spending cuts, and I also knew they were against tax cuts.

05:06.369 --> 05:13.860
And I didn't think Congress would ever uncork this massive tax reduction if we hadn't cut spending.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.605
But I mean, you entered in certainly with the conviction that

05:18.125 --> 05:19.106
this grand scheme.

05:19.266 --> 05:20.748
It was a good idea.

05:20.808 --> 05:25.855
I don't think the grand scheme had any fatal flaw on paper.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.397
Well, when did it screw up?

05:27.417 --> 05:32.183
It screwed up in the implementation, and the book documents that.

05:32.283 --> 05:36.107
How could it have succeeded, or was it doomed to failure from the outset?

05:36.348 --> 05:43.897
Well, probably in a practical political sense it was doomed to failure, but again, there's some subtlety here that nobody wants to grapple with.

05:45.699 --> 05:46.701
I just want to make sure it works.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.001
Go ahead.

05:47.521 --> 05:59.858
In the spring of 1981, after the plan had been launched, but before any votes had been taken, and in the end, Congress writes the spending laws and writes the tax laws.

05:59.978 --> 06:04.244
Anybody's paper plan can be thrown in the trash can in about two days.

06:05.786 --> 06:11.493
But after we got that paper plan up there, the consensus was the tax cut was going nowhere.

06:11.533 --> 06:12.895
People were afraid of it.

06:12.915 --> 06:17.241
They thought it was too big, too risky.

06:18.200 --> 06:35.959
And it was only the apparent success in cutting spending in the first two months that sort of changed the traffic light from red to green that sent Congress and all of us into this orgy of tax cutting in July.

06:37.060 --> 06:44.067
And as I document my book, in the out years, the tax cut turned out to be almost twice as large as we intended.

06:44.748 --> 06:46.570
And in the out years, once you've

06:46.988 --> 06:48.610
pierced through all of this fog.

06:49.010 --> 06:54.897
The spending cut turned out to be only one-third of the size that we intended.

06:54.917 --> 07:06.729
And so, when you double the revenue loss and you reduce the spending savings by two-thirds, of course the whole thing sort of splits apart at the seams radically.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.815
Now, you could say, well, why didn't you understand it at the time?

07:12.098 --> 07:22.592
Well, the answer was nobody really looked four or five, six years into the future in those days, because in those days we worked on one or two year budgets.

07:22.612 --> 07:27.298
But, I mean, this whole scheme, though, was looking not just five years into the future.

07:27.318 --> 07:28.940
I think it was looking into the future.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.722
No, it did look five years into the future.

07:30.742 --> 07:35.128
I mean, it was really looking—it was changing the whole scope of— Yeah, I know.

07:35.208 --> 07:40.435
But in terms of translating it into the numbers, which is where it fell apart,

07:41.005 --> 07:53.598
We project it as outsiders in the future, but, you know, the political process can't deal with 250 numbers.

07:53.638 --> 07:58.163
Now, the title of your book is almost an ironic title, The Triumph of Politics.

07:58.183 --> 07:59.605
But, I guess.

07:59.625 --> 08:03.268
Well, what it means is the triumph of politics over doctrine.

08:03.288 --> 08:04.049
Obviously.

08:04.109 --> 08:09.595
But doesn't, I hate to bring up the word naïve again, but doesn't politics

08:10.199 --> 08:14.406
inevitably triumph in the political system.

08:14.646 --> 08:19.353
But politics triumph in an unsatisfactory and ironic way.

08:21.396 --> 08:38.383
The politicians went ahead and did something against their better judgment, adopted a huge tax cut on the one hand, and continued to perform sort of the defensive protection, turf-minded

08:38.667 --> 08:42.371
approach on the spending side.

08:42.391 --> 08:55.623
Now, if they would have been recalcitrant on both questions, as they said they were at the beginning, no great damage would have been done, because the tax cut never would have gotten adopted.

08:55.663 --> 09:05.452
I think the great mystery of 1981 is how long had Congress lost its census and the administration and passed this giant tax cut in July 1981.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.235
People were voting for things they couldn't live with.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.991
Did you read Russell Baker this morning?

09:11.112 --> 09:11.312
No.

09:11.833 --> 09:12.414
Interesting.

09:12.855 --> 09:13.856
Do read it.

09:14.117 --> 09:19.226
I mean it's an interesting book, an interesting piece on your book.

09:19.246 --> 09:28.722
But he quotes someone who describes your book, I forget the person, but it's a cute quote, as a feel-bad book in a feel-good era.

09:29.748 --> 09:30.749
Can you respond to that?

09:31.630 --> 09:33.872
Well, yeah, I mean— Is it a feel-bad book?

09:33.952 --> 09:39.957
Is this a good—a feel-good— I suppose it's a feel-bad book, because it's a very idealistic plan turned to dust.

09:40.117 --> 09:44.121
I suppose it's a feel-bad book— I mean, a feel-bad specifically on your part.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.385
Yeah, because I— I mean, he also suggests sour grapes, too.

09:48.725 --> 09:49.946
Well, I don't think it's sour grapes.

09:50.066 --> 09:58.354
I mean, when you create a trillion dollars' worth of debt, double it in five years, unless you think that there's some shoebox out there that we're funding all that out of,

09:58.891 --> 10:01.035
I think it's a very good thing.

10:01.095 --> 10:05.722
When you leave the finances, the United States government is drastically out of balance.

10:05.823 --> 10:10.050
If the government is stalemated, paralyzed, you can't even make any decisions.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.332
I don't think that's such a good thing.

10:12.073 --> 10:21.709
When you have gotten by, by financing all that deficit to import and foreign capital, which isn't sustainable and you can't do that for the next ten or twenty years,

10:22.381 --> 10:32.670
and which has produced enormous distortions in the economy in terms of trade flows, jobs lost, industry investments, and so forth.

10:32.690 --> 10:34.211
You can't say that's a good thing.

10:34.291 --> 10:40.817
Now, for the moment the oil price collapsed in the stock and bond market took a little temporary comfort out of it, and that's supposed to be feel-good.

10:41.437 --> 10:43.319
Well, that isn't very stable for the long run.

10:44.400 --> 10:51.426
I don't think there are very many serious economists who think that it's going to have smooth sailing for the next five years.

10:52.115 --> 10:54.578
I think there are a lot of people who believe in the short run.

10:55.359 --> 10:57.361
So what are we looking at, in your view?

10:58.442 --> 11:01.186
I think we're looking at some rather insuperable choices.

11:01.266 --> 11:04.990
We can't live with this trade deficit, so we want to get the dollar down.

11:06.011 --> 11:12.519
But we can't get the dollar down radically because we need to attract foreign capital to finance the current deficit.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.482
And as time goes on, that noose will get tighter and tighter.

11:15.542 --> 11:21.109
And we sort of bob back and forth between one objective and the other, but the two are inconsistent.

11:21.545 --> 11:37.613
And so sooner or later you're going to grind the economy to a halt in terms of growth if you keep the dollar high, or you are going to unleash a new inflationary wave if you radically depreciate the dollar in order to improve the trade.

11:38.735 --> 11:40.017
Is this book a confessional?

11:41.660 --> 11:45.426
Well, yeah, I think it's not confessional and just individual.

11:48.241 --> 12:17.067
this book? Uh well not really it was sort of uh, I lived through it every day. I probably had a better grasp on what was happening than anybody else. Um all these ships passing in the night, all these miscommunications all these rationalizations all of this partisanship all this sloganeering, the papers over the reality so I thought it needed to be explained. Is there anything, I mean you certainly have you don't have to go into the the descriptions and characterizations because they're in the book? But you certainly have some things to say about the fellas?

12:24.218 --> 12:28.025
Yeah, because some of these guys stuck their head in the van for four years, I can see.

12:28.245 --> 12:33.855
But could we describe it as a settling scores type thing?

12:33.995 --> 12:41.488
No, it's just that I had a rather impossible thing to explain.

12:42.069 --> 12:45.896
Now for the moment everybody thinks, well, don't worry about the death that's behind me.

12:45.916 --> 12:46.617
That's crazy.

12:46.637 --> 12:48.420
I mean this thing will be back within months.

12:49.497 --> 12:56.391
But I had to explain how a plan that was going to get a balanced budget produced the most staggering.

12:56.411 --> 12:58.135
Do you feel like a Cassandra, perhaps?

12:58.596 --> 13:03.305
Well, I didn't intend to take on that role, but, you know, some people have given it to me, so.

13:04.368 --> 13:04.949
Is that right?

13:04.969 --> 13:10.881
Well, I mean, that's how it's been labeled, but the point is, I had to explain something, which is,

13:11.958 --> 13:17.485
you know, if you look at it objectively, a pretty devastating outcome.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.287
So why did it happen?

13:19.327 --> 13:20.368
Why did we stick with it?

13:20.388 --> 13:28.698
Why didn't we see that we were off track in September, November 1981, when I clearly told everybody we were, and fix it?

13:29.619 --> 13:37.890
Well, the answer was, for four years, people like me, people like Don Regan, simply kept a process of reality denial going.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.733
It was rather incredible and irresponsible.

13:40.949 --> 13:47.881
And I think history some day, if they don't like my charges, we document that.

13:48.522 --> 13:59.640
Your resume points out that you were the youngest person in this century, I guess, to hold a cabinet level position.

13:59.660 --> 14:01.243
Do you think maybe you were too young?

14:01.463 --> 14:06.872
Yeah, I think that's a fair criticism.

14:10.008 --> 14:18.737
But the point is… But along with the two years perhaps being a little bit realistic.

14:18.777 --> 14:19.198
Sure.

14:20.219 --> 14:37.517
Somebody who's been through the wars for ten years is going to be awful cautious about how far they push a new direction in policy, a big change in policy, because they have a better feel for

14:37.953 --> 14:44.142
how this political system is likely to kick up appeals and respond back.

14:44.262 --> 14:55.960
So I don't think any 34-year-olds, whether it's left-wing or right-wing, are necessarily safely put in with your politics.

14:55.980 --> 15:07.757
You describe, you get some nice feel, some nice scenes with this group, the LSG, and that's where you put your little calculator on there.

15:13.154 --> 15:23.931
No, I thought so for a little while, but then after I went through these miserable battles from September 1981 to August 1985, the losses of Lourdes.

15:24.492 --> 15:27.977
I mean, Henry Kissinger is described as an Ephrodisiac.

15:29.079 --> 15:31.302
Well, it may be if things are working right.

15:31.883 --> 15:40.697
But when you were struggling from, again, and I got to establish the record, and the book shows from September 1981, I was just

15:41.656 --> 15:50.810
Yeah, but I was constantly hitting brick walls, trying to get them to face up to this genie that's been a lot out of the box.

15:51.952 --> 15:56.039
And that wasn't all that exciting.

15:57.601 --> 16:00.846
Yeah, but you were the heavy, you were the tough guy going up to

16:02.952 --> 16:08.644
Yeah, but that's a, you know, in a way that's kind of a distorted recollection.

16:08.704 --> 16:17.042
After 1981, I did that in 81 when we launched, but after it was clear by September, this whole plan was off course.

16:17.082 --> 16:23.796
Basically, I was a beggar with a teen cop up on the hill a whole couple of times I hauled off an earring.

16:23.962 --> 16:27.265
I mean, you pissed off, pardon me, the farm-raising.

16:27.305 --> 16:30.128
Yeah, but you know, that happened in two instances.

16:30.248 --> 16:32.711
You know, that's about two minutes' worth of tea.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.933
But that's what the public remembers.

16:34.953 --> 16:40.258
But you point out, you know, the focused nature of TV news, I mean.

16:41.119 --> 16:42.760
That is nearly a media image.

16:42.801 --> 16:50.408
What I was doing day after day for years, going up there, hat in hand, behind closed doors,

16:50.928 --> 16:58.015
in the back door pleading with some of the more responsible people that helped me get.

16:58.035 --> 17:06.883
And it wasn't, you know, some kind of charge of the light brigade.

17:06.903 --> 17:20.175
It was just a fairly miserable process of trying to re-formulate the majority that had been

17:20.527 --> 17:21.748
Decimation.

17:21.769 --> 17:25.713
Being out, is it relief, frustration, bitterness, all of these, some of these?

17:26.034 --> 17:29.838
No, I mean, it's basically relief.

17:29.858 --> 17:30.479
In one word.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.041
Yeah.

17:32.061 --> 17:32.161
Yeah.

17:32.181 --> 17:35.085
I mean, you can only take that if it's so long.

17:35.105 --> 17:37.608
And you're finally saying, oh, it's enough.

17:37.628 --> 17:38.329
How about bitterness?

17:38.789 --> 17:39.290
No.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.973
No, not really.

17:41.993 --> 17:44.236
I don't feel you were treated shabbily by some of these.

17:44.416 --> 17:46.218
Oh, I think for a couple people, sure.

17:47.340 --> 17:48.441
Beaver.

17:49.248 --> 17:52.833
But on the whole, I think it was very accurate.

17:53.233 --> 18:02.646
Everyone certainly wants to get the idea, and you certainly call the fellas illiterate when it comes to reading, not just reading books.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.369
But by reading I didn't mean it.

18:05.389 --> 18:07.733
I mean, having meant idea-based.

18:07.833 --> 18:11.498
But you also say that they don't read books.

18:11.518 --> 18:13.921
But they do have a tube mentality, let's put it that way.

18:14.021 --> 18:17.145
Yeah, those are metaphors.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.292
You can read it after all the allegations.

18:22.392 --> 18:26.015
No, I don't think we have the allegations, but the little snippets came out.

18:28.158 --> 18:28.978
What's my question?

18:32.222 --> 18:33.023
What is my question?

18:33.743 --> 18:35.765
Where were we going on that, do you remember?

18:36.406 --> 18:39.689
Well, yeah, that's what my attitude was coming out of it.

18:40.470 --> 18:46.997
Yeah, there are a couple of sore points, but you know, I'm not mad at Chuck O'Neill, I'm not mad at most of the leaders in Congress.

18:49.323 --> 19:09.283
I guess I'm trying to back into your assessment of the intellectual acumen, as everyone is asking, who is a president or a dull-witted person, and the people about him, or they're dull-witted people, so you can use any adjective you want.

19:09.403 --> 19:17.811
One gets the feel here that we're dealing with people who have a very shallow, transparent grasp on

19:18.382 --> 19:21.466
I mean, we seem to go on image.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.809
Yeah, I think that's right.

19:23.829 --> 19:44.676
I mean, it's mostly slogans and cliches and, you know, how can you go on giving speeches about this big government monster six years later, when over the last six years you've come to the conclusion in deed, if not in word, that you don't have much of an argument with?

19:45.179 --> 19:46.361
You know, I don't know.

19:46.521 --> 20:04.465
I'm more of an intellectual type, so if I come up with a generalization, such as, you know, Washington is a, I don't know, what other words are used?

20:04.485 --> 20:06.268
Well, I can't remember.

20:06.288 --> 20:13.077
But that this government is way too big and it's overspending and all that to cause this problem.

20:13.630 --> 20:20.556
You know, I like to feel there's a little bit of factual documentation for that that is relevant to the size of the charge.

20:21.597 --> 20:30.164
But look at this trillion-dollar budget, debt service, defense, social security, farmers, veterans, and a couple other things, none of which the president wants to cut.

20:31.085 --> 20:41.134
Now, so therefore, how can you say the government's fat, overstuffed, overblown, and all of this, when you've embraced most of it, which makes it that big?

20:41.534 --> 20:42.675
How do you think that he...

20:43.162 --> 20:45.565
20 years from now we'll be judged, the president.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.089
Unless this deficit's fixed, I don't think very well.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.856
Your feelings are toward him, presumably, I'm sure he's asking.

20:54.876 --> 21:03.427
Well, I mean, you know, on the level of personality, he's one of the greatest personalities of all time to sit in an Oval Office.

21:04.829 --> 21:11.717
You couldn't ask for someone who had a better temperament in terms of bearing up under the pressures and temptations of the highest office in the land.

21:12.288 --> 21:17.314
I think the great failure is that his policies turned out pretty rotten.

21:18.295 --> 21:21.319
Well, does he have a simplistic view of life, do you think?

21:21.419 --> 21:23.261
He has an altimistic view.

21:23.622 --> 21:26.586
I love that little story that he loves to tell about the update.

21:26.606 --> 21:28.188
Yeah, the two ponies.

21:28.648 --> 21:37.459
He has a filtering device that allows him to filter out all the information except that which is most palatable.

21:37.579 --> 21:40.843
That which he likes, he remembers in great quantities.

21:41.448 --> 21:45.716
The problem is most of that isn't relevant.

21:45.776 --> 21:55.994
Does he surround himself with people who share the same view of life, the same grasp on them?

21:56.014 --> 21:58.319
Well, he surrounds himself with retainers.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.025
I mean, I don't think Edmise has been a great optimist.

22:02.065 --> 22:04.570
Basically, Edmise is never going to buy the presents.

22:05.562 --> 22:08.985
I don't think Deaver was an optimist or a pessimist.

22:09.005 --> 22:11.427
He was just coming there to do what the president wanted.

22:11.547 --> 22:15.331
Well, you know, the stakes are too great.

22:15.451 --> 22:16.852
The issues are too complicated.

22:16.872 --> 22:20.756
It's tough to have a bunch of yes-men around.

22:20.776 --> 22:22.798
Yourself, an optimist or a pessimist?

22:24.539 --> 22:25.620
Well, I used to be an optimist.

22:25.921 --> 22:30.485
I think I've turned into a pessimist.

22:33.307 --> 22:35.029
We've already been 20 minutes.

22:39.363 --> 22:44.810
I guess we asked about your legacy, and I guess, do you have a legacy?

22:44.890 --> 22:49.977
I mean, is the triple deficit triple whatever?

22:49.997 --> 22:52.020
Well, look, I don't think I produced a triple deficit.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.123
You provided the concrete program, you said.

22:54.403 --> 23:01.532
I sort of pushed the button, started the system, put the system in motion.

23:01.653 --> 23:03.095
Do you regret this?

23:03.115 --> 23:05.618
Yeah, I do, and I say that in the book.

23:05.638 --> 23:08.762
It was a mistake to push the button.

23:09.333 --> 23:23.718
to remake the world in a short period of time, because it's hard for this cacophonous democracy and process we have in Washington to keep its collective mind focused on anything.

23:24.239 --> 23:29.488
And so therefore, the bigger enterprise you unleash, the more likely an accident's going to happen.

23:29.528 --> 23:34.817
My whole theory is that a giant accident occurred in 1981.

23:35.303 --> 23:45.273
as a result of the system just getting wound up too tight, and being too frenetically engaged in policy action to keep track of what it was doing.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.194
Of what it was doing.

23:46.214 --> 23:46.955
Keep track of what it was doing.

23:46.975 --> 23:50.058
Let's cover two more things so you can make your plan a little bit quickly.

23:50.438 --> 23:55.764
I do want to just go over very briefly briefly the Atlantic thing, because I was fascinated by that.

23:56.324 --> 24:01.750
Now, clearly you were embarrassed by Hicks when I guess you were embarrassed.

24:07.298 --> 24:08.800
I guess, but weren't they taped?

24:09.221 --> 24:11.544
Yeah, he was taping the whole thing.

24:11.564 --> 24:22.341
Yeah, but it went on so long that I lost track of the rules that we set at the beginning, and we never did firm them up.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.963
And did you know you were working on a story?

24:24.003 --> 24:24.704
Let's put it that way.

24:24.724 --> 24:24.985
Sure.

24:25.125 --> 24:29.531
Yeah, I knew he was going to write a story, and there was nothing wrong with that story, frankly, except two or three quotes.

24:29.672 --> 24:30.673
One was the Trojan horse.

24:31.379 --> 24:33.243
That was a metaphor that I always used.

24:33.423 --> 24:35.648
I over-killed it, over-used it.

24:35.668 --> 24:40.979
But you go back to my record, and Allman even points out in his books back when he was always using Trojan horse.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.563
I kind of liked it.

24:42.603 --> 24:44.787
It was a way of saying, it's not what it appears to be.

24:44.827 --> 24:46.992
It looks like this, but there's something inside.

24:47.495 --> 24:53.723
So that metaphor sounded like I thought Kemp Ross was a scam.

24:53.803 --> 24:54.684
That wasn't it at all.

24:54.824 --> 25:02.594
I said that Kemp Ross was a good idea, but inside it was an even better idea, dropping the top rate from 70 to 50.

25:03.956 --> 25:09.823
But you know, that got twisted by the press so badly, I lost all faith in the American press when they couldn't even handle

25:10.090 --> 25:13.075
that metaphor in the clear context in which it was true.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.237
Oh, you know how the American press is.

25:14.277 --> 25:18.404
Yeah, well, you know, they deal with newsbikes, right?

25:18.444 --> 25:18.985
With a lead.

25:19.505 --> 25:21.188
Yeah, and somebody else wrote the lead.

25:21.208 --> 25:24.874
It wasn't married by the story, including their all-flapping and jaws and their feet in it.

25:25.555 --> 25:27.659
And now you have to run with them, too.

25:27.679 --> 25:29.863
I mean, two nights running, as you say.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.145
Yeah.

25:31.185 --> 25:36.233
Now, the other one that I used was, nobody understood what was going on with these numbers.

25:36.702 --> 26:00.529
for anybody, mildly conversant with the budget, whether a journalist, a senator, or someone who's spent a little time in budget time in the executive office knows that that is just a prosaic statement of frustration about the fact that in this trillion-dollar budget with the economy constantly changing, these numbers are always moving around as frustrating.

26:00.609 --> 26:04.093
But they took that one as if it were some confession

26:04.546 --> 26:06.429
That's good.

26:06.449 --> 26:07.631
I just want to ask you one other thing.

26:07.952 --> 26:12.559
The timing of the book, commerce certainly has something to do with it.

26:14.462 --> 26:21.594
It's not a sour grapes book so much as it is perhaps that you're taking advantage of a bullish marketplace right now.

26:21.614 --> 26:31.650
I mean this book is more saleable, perhaps because it's not written now, than it might be five years from now.

26:32.879 --> 26:34.821
That's fine.

26:36.042 --> 26:41.768
Does this have something to do with its being published now as opposed to after the administration?

26:41.828 --> 26:42.689
No, not at all.

26:42.729 --> 26:46.894
When I left in August, I said project number one was sit down and write the story.

26:47.715 --> 26:52.179
I then put it on the market, and the market did whatever it did.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.441
Whatever it did.

26:54.162 --> 27:00.148
My plan from beginning to end was spend the next four or five months writing the story, what happened, what was fresh in my mind.

27:00.168 --> 27:01.249
I had all the documents.

27:02.208 --> 27:09.578
And the economic value in the marketplace had nothing to do with it.

27:09.718 --> 27:12.502
It's fortuitous that it is what it is, let's put it that way.

27:12.882 --> 27:18.370
But you acknowledge that it certainly has more currency now than it might have.

27:18.390 --> 27:21.414
Well, that makes the book have more currency.

27:21.434 --> 27:21.674
Sure.

27:22.335 --> 27:25.439
It makes the book have more currency, but I would have written it anyway.

27:25.659 --> 27:30.025
I hope you don't mind using that.

27:30.085 --> 27:31.287
Is it data currency?

27:39.350 --> 27:55.603
great it's not my fault trust me another an hour we have a half a piece we have a pretty good
