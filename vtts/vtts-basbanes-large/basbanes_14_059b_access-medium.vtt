WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:14.749
We put that note, and it also has a copyright protection notice as well, which is to help us lay some claim to the digital file that was used to generate this.

00:15.252 --> 00:16.453
And the file is here.

00:16.854 --> 00:19.097
Was this sent out to be bound?

00:19.117 --> 00:19.918
Yeah, right.

00:20.519 --> 00:26.686
Here's this tutorial, which lays out the kind of approach for benchmarking to set conversion requirements.

00:26.846 --> 00:27.207
This is for me?

00:27.227 --> 00:27.728
Oh, good.

00:27.748 --> 00:28.108
Thank you.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.192
It also gives you information on the commission itself.

00:31.212 --> 00:32.373
Excellent.

00:32.393 --> 00:33.975
How many volumes do you think you have?

00:34.015 --> 00:37.340
I think we estimated 3,500 or so or 4,000.

00:37.400 --> 00:44.989
There's 3,500 or so now done, and we are...

00:45.323 --> 01:07.874
We'll be adding another 1.3 million images by year's end in this project called the Making of America Project, which is a joint effort between Cornell University and the University of Michigan to convert 5,000 volumes to digital.

01:11.579 --> 01:14.723
Focusing on 19th century literature.

01:15.833 --> 01:26.110
We're doing a lot of serial material, and they are doing a lot of monographs, and there are four goals of that project.

01:26.130 --> 01:27.713
I know.

01:28.474 --> 01:39.512
To select material that could be used on both campuses, that isn't available, to convert the information in

01:39.813 --> 01:51.809
in a good manner to provide access, equitable access across the two campuses and to evaluate the use of the material.

01:51.829 --> 02:03.365
And so that project's been funded by Mellon and we're now looking toward the planning for the second phase of that project which will involve the members of the National Digital Library Federation.

02:03.785 --> 02:05.888
Have you heard about that?

02:06.205 --> 02:14.275
Uh, there's 15 of the largest research libraries in the country, including the Library of Congress.

02:14.295 --> 02:15.497
And, uh, I love you after that.

02:15.517 --> 02:16.398
Thank you.

02:16.418 --> 02:24.488
And, um, the National Archives, um, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, all, you know, kind of the usual suspects.

02:24.508 --> 02:28.092
And the name of the... It's the National Digital Library Federation.

02:28.112 --> 02:29.394
Okay.

02:29.414 --> 02:34.440
And... I know, is this, is the, this is not the National Digital Library at LC?

02:34.460 --> 02:34.600
No.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.301
It's different.

02:35.450 --> 02:48.185
It's a federation that is really trying to look at defining protocols and the processes for distributed digital library development.

02:49.987 --> 02:53.431
I hope we've got one more floor to go.

02:53.451 --> 03:02.301
And out of that group will come partners for the second phase of the Making of America project, which will expand the

03:03.226 --> 03:13.563
amount of material available, contractual and sort of consortial obligations of members.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.709
We're going into the conservation departments, right?

03:16.829 --> 03:17.430
701.

03:18.171 --> 03:18.432
Right.

03:18.892 --> 03:20.115
Hi.

03:20.135 --> 03:24.021
We're here to, this is the scanning facility.

03:24.041 --> 03:24.201
I see.

03:24.302 --> 03:24.542
Okay.

03:29.011 --> 03:56.200
What we have up here are four scanning workstations.

03:56.618 --> 04:05.930
Two of them are black and white scanning systems, and we use them for text-based capture of information.

04:07.432 --> 04:11.517
Over here we have two HP scanners, Hewlett-Packard.

04:11.537 --> 04:13.299
These are grayscale colored.

04:13.319 --> 04:23.693
And we do a lot of training and workshops here, which really brings an international audience to Cornell to learn all about digital.

04:23.713 --> 04:25.495
It's that one little machine.

04:25.627 --> 04:31.535
And so we use these for experimentation and also... So you have... I noticed you have a Xerox.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.958
You have an HP.

04:34.179 --> 04:37.363
We have two HPs and two Xerox machines.

04:39.847 --> 04:44.573
We are now beginning to outsource most of the material that we scan.

04:44.954 --> 04:45.574
Outsource?

04:45.935 --> 04:47.497
Which means we work with a vendor.

04:48.058 --> 04:55.448
We have a company in La Crosse, Wisconsin called Northern Micrographics, which handles our...

04:56.407 --> 05:01.854
our scanning of text-based material.

05:02.755 --> 05:10.485
Principally, it's because of the need to do a lot of material in a short time frame.

05:10.926 --> 05:18.656
We had 900,000 images that had to be converted in less than a year, and because also the cost.

05:21.159 --> 05:24.844
For text-based material, they could create a

05:25.381 --> 05:29.065
600 DPI image for 12 and a half cents a page.

05:29.085 --> 05:37.132
And for halftone-like information, it cost us more, but there was a blended rate of about 18 and a half cents a page.

05:37.153 --> 05:37.833
That's all bad.

05:38.274 --> 05:39.595
That's not bad at all.

05:39.615 --> 05:40.456
We can't need that in-house.

05:40.516 --> 05:43.339
We'd probably be double that in-house.

05:43.359 --> 05:44.500
We don't run two ships.

05:44.660 --> 05:47.883
We don't, you know, crack the whip over Allen and Mason.

05:47.903 --> 05:49.845
Now leave the shell of these.

05:49.865 --> 05:50.566
Those are brittle books.

05:50.586 --> 05:51.487
Those are brittle books.

05:52.027 --> 05:55.050
Let me just go read some of the titles.

05:55.874 --> 05:57.477
If you don't mind.

05:57.497 --> 05:58.418
I should have brought a camera.

05:58.438 --> 06:00.001
This is an interesting photograph.

06:00.061 --> 06:02.305
This is Alan Quirk.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.808
My hand is occupied.

06:03.828 --> 06:04.329
I'm sorry.

06:04.349 --> 06:07.093
This is Nicholas Brisbane.

06:07.113 --> 06:12.202
And Alan, you want to give him a demonstration of what you're doing?

06:12.222 --> 06:12.543
Yes.

06:13.004 --> 06:14.546
I've lost my phone.

06:14.566 --> 06:15.047
I've lost my phone.

06:15.382 --> 06:28.040
Actually, right now, I've just started using a mouse as a foot pedal to increase the speed where we can get up to 400 scans an hour on this machine in the normal text mode.

06:28.521 --> 06:35.992
It's bitonal, it's 400 dpi, then interpolated to 600 dpi, and actually a very good algorithm for that.

06:36.012 --> 06:38.695
The results are excellent, actually.

06:38.715 --> 06:39.837
So this is a book that you...

06:40.188 --> 06:41.489
Disassembled, right?

06:41.529 --> 06:43.732
This is a book that actually comes to me disassembled.

06:43.752 --> 06:53.883
It comes to me with a structure already determined by the person who, and I would get this from either Mann Library, or I'll get it from Riddle Books, or I'll do some work with the MOA, so that each has their own structure thing.

06:53.963 --> 07:00.510
So it's called the Cornell University Library Digital Conversion Projects, and that's called the Projects.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.912
Yes, this is the flow sheet.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.634
The flow sheet.

07:04.654 --> 07:05.655
So the flow sheet tells you what?

07:06.108 --> 07:07.891
It just keeps us track of things.

07:07.971 --> 07:09.854
In other words, we have the document dimensions.

07:09.874 --> 07:12.999
If I have to go back and do something else with this document, I'll know what the dimensions are.

07:13.380 --> 07:19.770
When it's scanned, I'm going to have to shift it to make sure that they register correctly on a sheet of paper.

07:19.790 --> 07:22.434
And whatever shift is determined, I will fill that in here.

07:22.775 --> 07:27.222
And if anything comes up and I need to do anything over again, I can...

07:27.539 --> 07:30.723
I can replicate the original setting.

07:30.743 --> 07:37.012
So these books up here, well, from here over, from here over are the current ones.

07:37.032 --> 07:40.817
From there over are ones that have been previously done and are being held as examples, I guess.

07:40.837 --> 07:53.914
Let me just read some of the titles.

07:53.934 --> 07:54.035
Sure.

07:54.055 --> 07:56.618
I don't know whether it's 1.5 or 2 or whatever, but it's 1876, Devin and Cornwell, Loats, and Greening, speaking of New Yorkers.

08:07.347 --> 08:30.392
The might and mirth of literature.

08:30.412 --> 08:30.853
And we'll see the age.

08:30.873 --> 08:32.274
I don't have a date on it, but it's... This is probably another thing.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.256
And we go around the trial of Sir John Falstein.

08:33.276 --> 08:33.756
Travels in Central Asia.

08:33.776 --> 08:34.457
B-A-M with an accent on the A-E-Y.

08:34.477 --> 08:34.757
And on and on.

08:34.777 --> 08:35.498
And there's some nice little people.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.355
You want me to bring those down for you?

08:41.375 --> 08:44.339
Yeah, let me just get, like, two for four, if you don't mind.

08:45.500 --> 08:53.550
Actually, five volumes, and these are Memories of C, M-A-T-H-E-W-S.

08:54.471 --> 08:55.333
It's four volumes.

08:55.393 --> 08:56.894
Well, can we just take a look at them?

08:56.914 --> 08:57.555
Two, three, four.

08:58.456 --> 08:59.958
Exactly, a fifth volume.

08:59.978 --> 09:03.663
Well, the fifth volume has anecdotes, I guess.

09:03.683 --> 09:04.844
Now, Alan, what's your full name again?

09:05.044 --> 09:05.605
Alan Quirk.

09:06.346 --> 09:06.626
Q-U-I-R-K.

09:07.207 --> 09:07.948
How do you spell Alan?

09:08.198 --> 09:09.539
A-L-L-E-N.

09:09.559 --> 09:11.181
Okay, I'm my editor.

09:11.201 --> 09:14.845
And this is a book that's in deplorable condition.

09:14.865 --> 09:26.638
So it's the memoirs of Charles Matthews, M-A-T-H-E-W-S, Comedian, by Mrs. Matthews, second edition, volume one, London, 1839.

09:26.738 --> 09:28.920
There's a frontispiece.

09:28.940 --> 09:33.365
Now this is a very interesting, what looks like probably a steel engraving of Matthews.

09:33.926 --> 09:35.067
What's going to happen to that?

09:35.738 --> 09:40.645
It's a fine engraving, and my guess is that it may be a wood engraving.

09:41.046 --> 09:41.807
I don't know.

09:41.827 --> 09:42.307
Yes, it is.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.211
It could be copper or steel.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.296
I don't think it's wood, but what do I know?

09:48.316 --> 09:50.599
I think you're right.

09:50.619 --> 09:51.320
I think you're right.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.622
I was just thinking from the date.

09:52.642 --> 09:57.409
The earlier they are, the more likely they are to be wood.

09:57.429 --> 09:58.570
And this will be scanned as well.

09:58.991 --> 10:04.539
It gives special treatment to illustrations, which are halftones or halftone-like illustrations.

10:04.559 --> 10:04.699
Mm-hmm.

10:05.168 --> 10:11.294
so that it can catch the range of tone in there, even though we're doing it bitonal.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.556
This illustration itself is bitonal.

10:13.576 --> 10:22.725
It's black and white, but because of the shading, it makes it look like it has gray, and we try to interpret that in our bitonic scan.

10:23.306 --> 10:25.208
Your computer will do that for you.

10:25.849 --> 10:29.893
What's going to happen to that engraving?

10:29.913 --> 10:33.336
In our likelihood, it will go the way of the book.

10:34.666 --> 10:38.952
which is a way of saying it will be pumped or whatever.

10:39.032 --> 10:43.138
Actually, some people do glean from the books.

10:43.158 --> 10:44.059
And that's okay?

10:44.079 --> 10:44.320
It is.

10:44.480 --> 10:55.416
Once the books are discharged from the system, once we have an acceptable replacement on site, then, yes, these books are discharged, and the book will be treated as a volume.

10:55.576 --> 10:58.560
We have to point out that these books are in deplorable condition.

10:58.620 --> 10:59.742
I can see this.

10:59.802 --> 11:01.905
They've totally fallen apart, but...

11:01.885 --> 11:03.688
The bindings are in tatters.

11:05.070 --> 11:09.796
This has actually been disbound in addition.

11:10.497 --> 11:17.948
This is a book that really would not demand restoration, preservation in its own right.

11:18.789 --> 11:24.016
Even though once upon a time it might have been considered a pretty nice binding.

11:24.036 --> 11:24.978
The judgment calls it.

11:25.038 --> 11:27.762
Another institution it might be that, but not here.

11:28.242 --> 11:30.486
And currently we are doing no books that are rare.

11:30.546 --> 11:31.487
Right.

11:31.737 --> 11:35.401
So that, in other words, we're not destroying the final copy of the book anywhere.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.202
There are other copies.

11:36.242 --> 11:44.232
In fact, some of the MOA journals that we're replacing, there are actually other original copies right across the street in Uris Library.

11:44.252 --> 11:46.194
So there's another copy of this book somewhere?

11:46.314 --> 11:46.895
Not this one.

11:46.935 --> 11:52.301
I don't know the story about this one, but some of the MOA material is duplicated that closely.

11:52.702 --> 11:53.523
I see.

11:53.543 --> 11:55.325
In another library at Cornell.

11:55.345 --> 11:55.585
Okay.

11:55.953 --> 11:59.080
The binding will not replicate this binding at all.

11:59.280 --> 11:59.761
No, it will not.

11:59.781 --> 12:01.705
It'll be one of those green cloth bindings.

12:01.725 --> 12:02.206
Yeah, maybe red.

12:02.326 --> 12:03.248
Or red, whatever.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.874
Yes, it'll be a buckram.

12:05.894 --> 12:07.257
Okay.

12:07.277 --> 12:08.359
Good.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.213
Oh, do a scan, please.

12:10.393 --> 12:15.278
Then I'll show you what Mason's doing over here.

12:15.298 --> 12:16.319
Okay.

12:16.339 --> 12:17.420
Can I sit here?

12:17.440 --> 12:18.060
You may.

12:18.480 --> 12:27.268
And also, as I say, I've just recently modified my mouse to use it as a foot pedal because it increases my scanning at about 40%.

12:27.909 --> 12:31.752
I dropped this tape recorder this morning, and I can't get it to record slow.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.473
I don't know why.

12:33.514 --> 12:35.155
Are you skilled at tape recorders?

12:35.275 --> 12:37.317
No, not at that size, no.

12:46.578 --> 12:51.566
This volume is printed on NC standard paper, archival paper.

12:51.626 --> 13:01.440
And now we don't have that because we have so many derivatives, potential derivatives for the digital files that to put that on there, then someone else can print it out on newsprint.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.243
So we now, I'll use a rubber stamp.

13:03.263 --> 13:10.274
When we make our final print, we'll put it in a rubber stamp what the standard for the paper is.

13:10.294 --> 13:10.394
Okay.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.417
And also, Alan, before we leave, can you get the URL for that digital ID?

13:13.561 --> 13:19.691
Yeah, I hope I've got it on there, because otherwise I'll find it somewhere.

13:19.711 --> 13:25.259
I've opened the window here so that we can watch what we're doing, and I've also taken off grayscale.

13:25.780 --> 13:30.287
I'll put that back on for just a minute, because those are both things which slow down...

13:39.987 --> 13:42.750
is showing the grayscale image.

13:43.271 --> 13:45.713
And it's a smaller image, it's not the full image.

13:46.294 --> 13:51.800
And when we are doing our actual setup and visual QC, we will do it on... I'll just do one.

13:51.820 --> 13:52.621
What's a QC?

13:52.641 --> 13:54.643
Quality control.

13:54.663 --> 14:00.770
And right now what I've done is I've just triggered it with my foot to do the next scan.

14:00.790 --> 14:03.072
Boy, that's fast, huh?

14:03.092 --> 14:03.332
Yes.

14:03.773 --> 14:07.497
And it's much faster when we do...

14:08.523 --> 14:33.417
I can get up to nine seconds an image, up to 400 A. When we're doing the setup, we check in the detail view, which is important because this is a derivative, actually, of the digital file.

14:34.325 --> 14:40.775
This has been changed somewhat, so we'll go to the actual details and view where every pixel is expressed as a single pixel on the screen.

14:41.856 --> 14:45.362
And this gives us the ability to see, you know, to make the fine distinctions.

14:45.442 --> 14:49.728
And then when we're running, we don't stay in that.

14:49.748 --> 14:53.794
How long will it take you to do one book like this?

14:53.835 --> 14:56.979
You're displaying page 742 as we spread it.

14:56.999 --> 15:00.044
So my assumption is you've already done 741.

15:00.064 --> 15:01.887
That's right.

15:02.588 --> 15:02.728
I hope.

15:03.350 --> 15:07.414
A booklet, this book is 792 pages when it'll be done.

15:07.974 --> 15:13.239
It is, that will take about two hours to scan, not counting the setup.

15:13.259 --> 15:17.743
The setup will take another anywhere between five and 20 minutes, depending on the trickiness of it.

15:17.764 --> 15:19.645
So probably two and a half to three hours.

15:19.745 --> 15:21.347
Two and a half hours between the time I get it.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.089
I'll say three hours because then I structure it.

15:23.129 --> 15:24.089
I add structure labels.

15:24.830 --> 15:28.634
And why don't I... Does somebody... Easier to show you on that.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.677
To actually make sure that you've got, that you didn't miss a page?

15:31.797 --> 15:33.238
We do 100%.
