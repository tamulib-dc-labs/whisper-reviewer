WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:04.610
Well, I was talking to Dr. Robert Belly.

00:04.651 --> 00:07.956
Now, do you, do people call you doctor or commander?

00:07.976 --> 00:08.617
How do you like that?

00:08.817 --> 00:09.558
Well, Bob.

00:11.541 --> 00:12.823
I'm used to Bob.

00:12.843 --> 00:22.959
In fact, I did the CNN yesterday, and they kept referring to me as commander, and that's been so long since I've been referred to by my military.

00:23.320 --> 00:23.740
It's nice.

00:24.061 --> 00:24.722
You know, it's nice.

00:25.006 --> 00:26.308
It just caught me off guard.

00:26.328 --> 00:27.911
Oh, I know I left as a lieutenant.

00:28.011 --> 00:32.718
Did you leave active duty as— I left as active duty as a lieutenant and then I resigned.

00:33.580 --> 00:40.370
And then I was brought back in because I had to be an officer to be involved in certain projects.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.694
I couldn't be a civilian.

00:47.112 --> 00:48.395
Yeah, yeah.

00:49.116 --> 00:53.645
And my recollection of that, I was still an undergraduate in college when I was 63, I guess.

00:53.765 --> 00:54.286
64, yeah.

00:54.306 --> 00:55.589
63, 64.

00:56.471 --> 01:01.260
And the perception always was that it just, I mean... Down it went, right.

01:01.340 --> 01:03.485
It just went down and they were in a dive.

01:03.505 --> 01:04.747
Yeah, it didn't come out.

01:04.767 --> 01:07.753
It didn't come out, but the way we constructed that.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.583
Pretty terrifying, isn't it?

01:11.603 --> 01:12.924
Pretty amazing, yeah.

01:12.944 --> 01:14.406
A whole sequence of events.

01:14.426 --> 01:17.929
And this was all reconstructed by communications?

01:17.949 --> 01:23.334
By communications plus the implosion records.

01:23.354 --> 01:25.116
They could hear it break up.

01:25.556 --> 01:27.538
And they could reconstruct that.

01:27.578 --> 01:28.879
Same with the scorpion.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.583
And then obviously the extensive amount of diving we did on it.

01:32.983 --> 01:34.845
I photographed every square inch of it.

01:36.286 --> 01:38.128
I documented every square inch of it.

01:38.632 --> 01:49.410
You know, just by contrast, the enthusiasm that you have for this, I can compare this interview, I've done several with him, but just recently with Carl Sagan.

01:49.430 --> 01:50.171
Oh, yeah.

01:50.191 --> 01:51.593
Because he's sick, I just read.

01:51.613 --> 01:52.394
I hope not.

01:52.735 --> 01:55.059
I just read that he has a bone marrow disease.

01:55.539 --> 01:55.960
Oh, jeez.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.222
This is in the paper yesterday.

01:58.725 --> 02:00.187
How do you see it?

02:00.988 --> 02:01.189
Yeah.

02:01.209 --> 02:02.010
Yeah, I met him once.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.214
I met him once briefly at a hotel.

02:04.234 --> 02:05.095
I mean, like...

02:05.446 --> 02:08.790
He chatted for seconds in the lobby, and that was him.

02:08.810 --> 02:13.036
But the reason I raise it is the enthusiasm he has.

02:13.056 --> 02:26.513
Because there's only once in the history of human history, only one opportunity where you can be present at whatever, you know, whether you make contact with the moon or walk on the moon.

02:26.673 --> 02:30.178
And there's a quote that you've made a number of times.

02:30.999 --> 02:34.423
Yeah, we know more about the far side of the moon or the bottom of the ocean.

02:34.443 --> 02:35.284
We know about the ocean.

02:35.956 --> 02:39.040
Well, and the ocean is so important to us.

02:39.461 --> 02:41.363
And it's going to become even more so.

02:42.084 --> 02:49.854
I mean, there are more people alive today than have died during the entire history of the human race.

02:50.575 --> 02:52.798
And we're going to double that in eight years.

02:52.818 --> 02:54.300
We're not going to live in space right away.

02:54.801 --> 02:55.862
We're not going to live on the moon.

02:55.882 --> 02:59.707
We're not going to live on Mars for a couple generations, if ever.

03:01.129 --> 03:04.714
And yet there's this incredible ignorance about the ocean by...

03:04.964 --> 03:09.048
We don't live on 18 percent of the Earth, 19 percent.

03:09.068 --> 03:13.173
And we have no choice but to move out onto the ocean and into the ocean.

03:13.193 --> 03:13.593
That's right.

03:13.713 --> 03:14.494
You perceive this?

03:15.055 --> 03:18.638
Yeah, I don't think we're going to live down the abyss and turn on the light bulb.

03:18.658 --> 03:22.282
But I do see us living out on the ocean.

03:22.302 --> 03:33.394
I see the migration of people out into that living space, particularly since there's some really clever technologies that are coming along that make it inexpensive, safe, and comfortable.

03:33.934 --> 03:34.735
And that's the whole thing.

03:34.985 --> 03:43.515
spar buoy concept where if you take a pencil and you put a little piece of lead on it, put it in a bathtub, you can't excite it, it won't move.

03:43.535 --> 03:49.022
If you throw waves at it, it only moves one tenth of the wave that goes by it.

03:49.443 --> 03:56.331
So I see vertical condominiums that are half in, half out of the water where you can get the best of both worlds.

03:56.591 --> 03:56.992
Not far.

03:58.374 --> 03:58.994
Just out.

03:59.735 --> 04:04.401
You don't have to go very far before you get over the curvature of the earth and it's all gone.

04:04.702 --> 04:10.251
My concern is that I know that when we have fall weather coming and there are hurricanes— You're winched down.

04:10.731 --> 04:11.913
Well, you take the ship out.

04:11.953 --> 04:14.177
You leave port, though, too.

04:14.197 --> 04:14.858
You get out of here.

04:14.918 --> 04:16.300
You would just winch down.

04:16.320 --> 04:24.233
You'd have these things in a few hundred feet of water, enough to be below the surge, and you'd just winch it down.

04:25.114 --> 04:32.245
When you talk about the vastness of the ocean and how little is known and how—

04:32.883 --> 04:35.286
The vast proponents have never been seen.

04:35.306 --> 04:35.446
Seen.

04:35.586 --> 04:38.189
Mostly the Southern Hemisphere.

04:39.851 --> 04:40.312
Yeah.

04:40.412 --> 04:45.077
It's always a sense of, I mean, it's not just discovery.

04:45.157 --> 04:45.638
No, no.

04:45.878 --> 04:51.785
It's, you really, I mean, you apparently have a lot of moments, I guess, to savor, when you say, gee.

04:52.346 --> 04:59.154
Well, it's just, yeah, what's also interesting about the deep sea is that it's intimate, despite its size.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.236
Everything...

05:01.587 --> 05:25.148
appears at about 30 feet everything appears at about 30 feet it's a living room sort of uh all of a sudden the titanic pops into view at 30 feet all of a sudden these exotic creatures just pop into view like this veil is lifted and and things can happen right around you like the doll set going by your window and it's

05:25.718 --> 05:28.281
You just recoil and crack your head.

05:28.401 --> 05:38.032
It's almost like an opening image in a photographic bath, which appears gradually, and there's a sense of a growing expectation.

05:38.112 --> 05:39.033
It snaps.

05:39.053 --> 05:40.314
It pops.

05:40.334 --> 05:41.596
And it's sort of like poltergeist.

05:41.656 --> 05:42.957
It's right behind that door.

05:43.298 --> 05:48.603
You want to open the door, but you're also nervous of it.

05:49.084 --> 05:55.371
When you're making a dive, like when we crashed into the bottom, it just pops into view, and then it hits you.

05:55.638 --> 05:58.201
Or a shark just suddenly is there.

05:58.601 --> 06:01.544
Or a swordfish is suddenly in your face.

06:02.605 --> 06:08.131
So there's these moments of serenity punctuated by sheer terror.

06:10.053 --> 06:12.776
It's fascinating.

06:12.816 --> 06:14.398
You're also three-dimensional.

06:14.718 --> 06:16.120
You're no longer this biped.

06:17.081 --> 06:17.982
You fly.

06:19.043 --> 06:21.125
And your motions are like this.

06:22.146 --> 06:25.510
And so you have this sense of flight.

06:26.283 --> 06:28.607
that you don't have walking around on land.

06:29.107 --> 06:31.010
Because of buoyancy you can fly.

06:31.912 --> 06:39.864
I did an interview a number of years ago with Buzz Alton, I guess who was... Right, Malcolm was the co-opter with him.

06:39.964 --> 06:45.693
That's right, a collaborator or whatever it is.

06:45.713 --> 06:51.261
I just wanted to articulate for me what it was like to be standing in this place.

06:51.595 --> 06:55.078
And it's like a typical test pilot.

06:55.138 --> 06:57.580
I don't have time for that stuff.

06:57.820 --> 06:58.521
Well, you do.

06:59.142 --> 07:02.284
But I'm wondering if there's this enthusiasm that I sense with you.

07:02.304 --> 07:05.647
There's always two people inside of you.

07:06.528 --> 07:10.131
There's a professional and there's a human.

07:10.151 --> 07:16.677
And at times, elements are drawing purely upon your professional skill sets and you're almost animatronic.

07:16.697 --> 07:17.718
You're almost robotic.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.100
But there's a lot of moments.

07:20.435 --> 07:30.028
when you aren't being called upon, your skill set isn't being called upon, and you can just, it sinks in what you're doing.

07:31.670 --> 07:42.865
I'm sure a heart surgeon who was the first to remove a human's heart, and there was this moment when you looked down and there was this hollow chest with nothing in it.

07:44.009 --> 07:46.191
And then he took this other heart and put it in.

07:46.412 --> 07:50.656
There has to have been a moment where he went, oh my God, Jesus.

07:50.676 --> 07:51.837
What am I serious?

07:51.957 --> 07:53.139
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:53.719 --> 08:02.509
You know, and there are those moments when you just sit there, because the ocean, everything moves in slow motion.

08:02.529 --> 08:08.635
I mean, you still, on today's fastest oceanographic ship, go 15 miles an hour.

08:09.616 --> 08:13.020
When you're down underwater, you're moving at less than a mile an hour.

08:13.355 --> 08:42.855
you are you're not even walking speed you're slower than walking and so everything sort of it's like slow motion and so you have plenty of time to be reactive I'm sure when he was on the moon there had to have been moments when he was about to go to sleep when he went oh my god I'm on the moon I did that when I was sitting on the deck of the Titanic I mean

08:43.561 --> 08:49.989
You know, we went through the whole landing procedure, which we were nervous about, because we didn't know if the deck was strong.

08:50.009 --> 08:51.631
I had no idea, you know.

08:52.792 --> 08:55.575
Three-quarters of the century, you had no idea if it went through it.

08:55.595 --> 08:55.936
Sure.

08:55.956 --> 09:10.253
As soon as you landed, so I can remember the pilot and myself were... Yeah, yeah, just a little more, a little more, and you're going through this whole landing process, like you're landing on the moon, and then you go clank, clank, and then you took on a ten-degree lift to the ship.

09:10.273 --> 09:12.235
As soon as you landed, you went clunk, clunk.

09:12.822 --> 09:15.787
So, what was the feeling then?

09:15.807 --> 09:20.714
Well, it was like, oh my God.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.278
I mean, you were almost whispering.

09:23.299 --> 09:27.625
Because it was just… And you just looked out the window.

09:27.645 --> 09:30.650
Just look at a bug crawling across the deck.

09:32.092 --> 09:33.935
Did you expect to find any remains?

09:34.817 --> 09:36.940
No.

09:37.122 --> 09:40.666
I knew that from the Thresh and the Scorpion, which was fresher than ever.

09:40.686 --> 09:43.649
And it is interesting that... You have shoes.

09:43.669 --> 09:45.291
You have shoes in all these cases.

09:45.311 --> 09:46.773
All of them.

09:46.973 --> 09:59.907
On every ship we've ever... Well, when you come across them like that, just like that, and you just imagine humans, and you look up and you see the belt,

10:00.477 --> 10:02.400
Or a wristwatch fan.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.523
Or a hat fan.

10:04.543 --> 10:05.825
And that stuff was all over you.

10:05.845 --> 10:06.025
All that?

10:06.446 --> 10:08.209
A satchel sitting there.

10:09.751 --> 10:11.093
The other people picked up.

10:11.113 --> 10:13.076
I thought that was pretty tasteless.

10:13.577 --> 10:14.618
How do you feel about that?

10:14.658 --> 10:17.022
You don't mind our going for a month jumping around?

10:17.042 --> 10:25.735
No, I— I mean, you must have known, certainly— I couldn't have believed— That they were going to pinpoint where you were.

10:25.915 --> 10:26.656
Well, they were with me.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.339
They wrote down the coordinates.

10:28.719 --> 10:29.100
The French.

10:29.367 --> 10:37.799
I didn't expect them to loot the ship, because that was an act of a government.

10:39.381 --> 10:44.228
I didn't expect the French government to do that, what they did.

10:45.349 --> 10:49.795
Jean-Louis Michel said at the time that France will never, never disturb their sight.

10:51.658 --> 10:52.299
Well, he was wrong.

10:53.441 --> 10:57.366
So I was surprised that it happened that quickly the next year.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.732
that they would do it.

10:59.972 --> 11:01.013
That they would do it.

11:01.294 --> 11:01.995
I mean, why?

11:02.395 --> 11:03.036
A government.

11:04.017 --> 11:05.660
What are they going to get out of it?

11:05.920 --> 11:08.544
They've got more beautiful art in the Louvre.

11:09.705 --> 11:12.890
What does France need to get involved with picking up pots and pans?

11:13.911 --> 11:22.763
I think there just was a something in the French culture, something in their psychic that I missed.

11:23.224 --> 11:23.925
Were you deceived?

11:24.826 --> 11:25.767
No, I think

11:28.092 --> 11:29.374
I don't think I was deceived.

11:29.794 --> 11:32.237
That could have even used a stronger word, too, I think.

11:34.780 --> 11:37.043
No, no, Jean-Louis couldn't speak for the French government.

11:37.123 --> 11:42.750
I mean, Jean-Louis felt what he felt and said what he said and never took anything himself.

11:43.611 --> 11:56.327
No, I think he as a human being was—I think what happened was the people that were involved, it got removed from their feelings to an abstract bureaucrat in Paris who said, we can make some money.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.509
Maybe.

11:58.529 --> 12:00.131
It's pretty expensive to get out of here.

12:00.151 --> 12:01.173
Well, they got their money back.

12:02.034 --> 12:03.736
Americans actually paid the bill.

12:04.537 --> 12:08.503
The first group was that group that did Geraldo Rivera's opening of Autophon State.

12:09.184 --> 12:11.507
That was disgusting.

12:11.527 --> 12:13.289
So that was pretty bad.

12:15.332 --> 12:16.774
That was just pretty tasteless.

12:16.894 --> 12:21.601
But that's why I haven't given out locations of any of the other ships.

12:21.621 --> 12:23.584
I've never published a location of Bismarck.

12:23.604 --> 12:24.926
I offered it to the German government.

12:24.946 --> 12:25.687
They said, that's fine.

12:26.187 --> 12:26.668
Didn't want it.

12:26.834 --> 12:27.595
Why?

12:27.615 --> 12:29.537
I don't think they wanted the responsibility of knowing.

12:29.597 --> 12:39.590
The only government that has sought me out for a coordinate was the Australian government, after I found the Canberra in Guadalcanal in Arabunnam Sound.

12:39.610 --> 12:44.236
They're the only country that came to me and said, could we have the coordinates?

12:44.256 --> 12:46.218
How the hell do you find these things and they can't?

12:46.899 --> 12:47.600
They don't look.

12:48.421 --> 12:49.542
They could if they wanted to.

12:50.904 --> 12:56.571
You know, explorers are explorers, and they do things that other people don't do.

12:57.293 --> 13:03.563
They're motivated by a whole different set of motivations, whereas governments don't explore, really.

13:04.364 --> 13:10.454
They may take advantage of what an explorer does, like Spain and Columbus.

13:10.494 --> 13:12.637
I mean, Columbus got thrown in a slammer when he came home.

13:12.657 --> 13:13.538
He got thrown in jail.

13:14.300 --> 13:25.377
So I've never looked at—the only people that seemed to really explore in the time—well, I guess the Portuguese didn't manage to, too, but the English were very good about it.

13:25.525 --> 13:27.429
Captain Cook, who was one of my heroes.

13:27.529 --> 13:30.976
There's a new biography of him.

13:32.138 --> 13:35.785
I was just, I tried to go to where he died, and I couldn't get to it.

13:35.805 --> 13:38.510
It's at the very end, but you know what it makes?

13:38.530 --> 13:39.552
Again, I didn't realize this.

13:39.612 --> 13:43.360
William Bly, every book you read, he turns up in every damn book he read.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.582
He was involved in that.

13:44.602 --> 13:46.045
He was a hell of a navigator.

13:46.646 --> 13:47.247
Spectacular.

13:47.463 --> 13:48.889
Incredible navigator.

13:48.949 --> 13:50.094
What a hunter.

13:50.114 --> 13:54.833
He opens fire, loads the guns with balls instead of shot him.

13:55.094 --> 13:56.359
He's shooting to kill him.

13:57.402 --> 14:00.905
He was thirty-six hundred miles in an open boat.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.026
Amazing.

14:02.167 --> 14:03.127
Amazing.

14:03.268 --> 14:04.609
Amazing speed.

14:04.629 --> 14:06.671
I mean, you have to take your hat off to him.

14:06.731 --> 14:07.752
That's spectacular.

14:07.772 --> 14:10.715
He sort of reminds you of the Tasmanian Devil.

14:11.816 --> 14:17.261
He's the only guy you can pick on who accepted the indignity of a mutiny boat at sea and on land.

14:17.461 --> 14:18.582
He wouldn't have killed himself.

14:18.802 --> 14:22.566
And then he had some mutiny over in Australia.

14:22.606 --> 14:24.408
He had the colony over.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.970
He was a scourge.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.466
But Cook was a wonderful guy.

14:29.747 --> 14:33.492
I mean, he was, he died on the Big Island on the Kona Coast.

14:33.512 --> 14:38.999
And I tried, I drove down, I was there doing this thing for children, the Jason Project, just last month.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.061
And my wife said, well, what do you want?

14:41.081 --> 14:44.426
I said, I want to go where Captain Cook died.

14:44.446 --> 14:45.807
And I just want to go there.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.509
Just want to go there.

14:47.529 --> 14:49.232
So we drove all over the place to get there.

14:49.252 --> 14:51.755
And we drove down, and they're not real proud of it.

14:52.396 --> 14:52.876
They shouldn't be.

14:52.896 --> 14:54.078
There's not a lot of signs.

14:54.258 --> 14:57.362
There's not, you say, well, where was Captain, who?

14:57.865 --> 15:01.430
Well, you know, Captain Cook, the world's greatest explorer, was... I don't know.

15:01.450 --> 15:02.792
I don't know anything about it.

15:03.293 --> 15:14.970
And so finally I got down to this little end of the road, and they were selling some soda, and really, a woman was selling homemade cookies and stuff like that.

15:15.671 --> 15:20.558
And I looked out in the water, and across the way, across the bay, was this memorial.

15:20.918 --> 15:24.984
But you can't get to it unless you swim or go by boat.

15:25.004 --> 15:26.286
It's at the base of a cliff.

15:26.924 --> 15:30.189
And I couldn't get over that, but I could see it.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.293
He screwed up, though.

15:32.313 --> 15:34.496
His arrogance, I think, got to him.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.823
Well, yeah, I think he just, you only need to make one little screw-up.

15:40.085 --> 15:41.287
It's like the Israeli army.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.489
You only have to lose one war.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.032
That's right.

15:44.212 --> 15:46.696
You know, the other guys can lose them all.

15:46.756 --> 15:47.698
They don't have to win one.

15:47.838 --> 15:49.000
Now, you mentioned Cook.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.823
Do you have personal heroes?

15:51.484 --> 15:51.724
Cook.

15:52.466 --> 15:53.387
I have his journals.

15:54.312 --> 15:59.360
Do you have the books, the art of Captain Cook's Voyager?

15:59.380 --> 16:00.061
Yeah, I have that.

16:01.183 --> 16:02.625
It reminds me of a lot of stories.

16:02.885 --> 16:03.707
Marco Polo.

16:04.027 --> 16:06.811
I love the travels of Marco Polo.

16:07.272 --> 16:11.939
How he could move 30 miles and go from heaven to hell, and then back to heaven.

16:12.741 --> 16:22.716
How the world was so, so many worlds back then that were insulated, and you could have, you know, sort of the classic sand,

16:23.084 --> 16:28.389
The best form of government is a benevolent dictator, and the worst form is a non-venevilent dictator.

16:28.409 --> 16:29.571
I mean, you could just see this.

16:31.292 --> 16:33.394
The travels of Marco Polo were just fascinating.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.918
Think about Captain Nemo, naturally.

16:36.978 --> 16:39.320
As a child, that was my real hero.

16:40.181 --> 16:41.563
That was my fantasy.

16:41.603 --> 16:45.647
So the blood of exploration is always coursed through your veins, then?

16:45.767 --> 16:47.889
Well, I think it might be in the genes.

16:48.209 --> 16:51.032
My family came to America in 1635.

16:51.805 --> 16:58.272
And they settled in Virginia, in Williamsburg, and they migrated across the United States.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.716
My grandfather was killed in a gunfight.

17:01.736 --> 17:03.638
He was a marshal of Wichita, Kansas.

17:04.118 --> 17:06.501
He was killed in William Ballard.

17:07.162 --> 17:10.605
He was killed in 1920 in a gunfight, and he's buried in Wichita.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.550
My father was a cowboy.

17:14.570 --> 17:19.775
After his mother died, he was orphaned, and he was shipped out to the homesteads.

17:19.855 --> 17:21.357
He grew up in Montana.

17:22.231 --> 17:25.174
and was a cowboy, was Chester Ballard.

17:25.975 --> 17:29.660
And then he went on to become chief engineer of the Minute Man missile program.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.584
So he really was the one that made the big move.

17:34.105 --> 17:37.910
My brother and I are the first in our family to ever go to college and graduate.

17:39.431 --> 17:45.419
All the rest were, for 110 years we were Quakers in North Carolina.

17:45.439 --> 17:50.044
So we've been on the move and constantly, I think, I just say that

17:50.530 --> 17:56.316
My family landed in 1635, walked across America, arrived at the Pacific, and I kept walking.

17:58.077 --> 18:07.226
And so I feel that it's part of my genetic heritage to be on the move, to explore.

18:07.246 --> 18:08.327
But you started out in the Army.

18:08.367 --> 18:11.711
That's kind of a— Well, that's because they didn't offer anything else.

18:11.731 --> 18:18.878
Where I went to school, I was at UC Santa Barbara, and it was mandatory military service, but they only had the Army.

18:19.738 --> 18:20.419
They had no choice.

18:20.753 --> 18:23.178
That's pretty cool that they transferred your commission, though.

18:23.198 --> 18:25.201
Well, I was getting a PhD in oceanography.

18:25.943 --> 18:27.025
They were a little enlightened.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.608
I mean, Vietnam was a funny time.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.672
Mostly, it didn't work.

18:30.692 --> 18:36.703
And for me, I don't know why, some computer made a mistake and did the right thing.

18:37.358 --> 18:40.662
and put me into deep submergence and sent me to Woods Hole.

18:41.243 --> 18:43.085
It's like coming home, isn't it, for you?

18:43.105 --> 18:48.592
Did you know instantly that this is a— When I arrived—well, initially it was a culture shock for me.

18:48.612 --> 18:51.055
I'd never been east of the Mississippi, and I was a Westerner.

18:51.976 --> 18:55.340
And Westerners are Westerners, and it's a huge difference.

18:55.500 --> 18:59.925
Yeah, but it's amazing how many kids that I went to OCS with down in Newport.

18:59.945 --> 19:04.791
I mean, the most fervent—I mean, the ones who probably went career are the guys from the Midwest, Oklahoma.

19:04.991 --> 19:05.492
Oh, yeah.

19:05.928 --> 19:11.435
Mid-Westerners for the Navy and Southerners for the Army.

19:11.535 --> 19:16.662
I remember my first skipper in the carrier, Jack Kenyoner, from Oklahoma.

19:16.682 --> 19:18.925
I mean, it's amazing how they— Well, it was fascinating.

19:18.945 --> 19:26.675
The other night I was doing the Jim Bohanna Show, which is a Larry King mutual radio network throughout the United States.

19:26.695 --> 19:28.918
And it was a two-hour thing.

19:28.938 --> 19:34.205
And the phone-ins, and every person that called in was from the Midwest.

19:34.265 --> 19:34.585
Yeah.

19:35.122 --> 19:36.885
They just can't believe there's emotion.

19:36.965 --> 19:38.227
Well, it's just fascination.

19:38.748 --> 19:39.629
It is the lure.

19:39.950 --> 19:42.093
You also correct this point of view.

19:42.113 --> 19:47.021
As beautifully and as mesmerizing as it is, it's also very unforgiving.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.062
Very unforgiving.

19:48.082 --> 19:49.044
It has no conscience.

19:49.264 --> 19:50.506
It kills it just, boom.

19:50.546 --> 19:51.267
Without a thought.

19:51.347 --> 19:51.948
Without a thought.

19:51.968 --> 19:54.332
It can be gorgeous within five seconds.

19:54.472 --> 19:56.656
And then the fish will come in and eat you very sweetly.

19:56.676 --> 19:57.277
Very sweetly.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.340
And they'll say thank you.

19:59.489 --> 20:12.566
But when you got into the submersible rules on the project, did you sense that this was going to be a career of exploration, or was it really more or less professional and scientific kind of a thing?

20:12.766 --> 20:20.977
I wanted to be an explorer, and it was a bad word in the scientific world, to be an explorer.

20:21.017 --> 20:24.221
It was kind of a chivalric, a non-professional kind of thing.

20:24.241 --> 20:27.505
Playing romantic was unprofessional.

20:28.042 --> 20:30.644
And there's this clinicalness to it.

20:31.845 --> 20:33.667
But I was a romantic.

20:33.687 --> 20:34.207
I still am.

20:34.828 --> 20:38.431
And I just think in the epic journey.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.854
I mean, my view of life is the epic journey.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.077
It's sort of like Joseph Campbell who said, life is the act of becoming.

20:45.097 --> 20:46.738
You never arrive.

20:47.519 --> 20:54.085
And I look at this journey as synonymous with life.

20:55.466 --> 20:58.048
To go out and do what I do is to...

20:58.602 --> 21:02.065
do what life's all about, and that is to dream.

21:03.086 --> 21:03.887
I'm a dreamer.

21:03.947 --> 21:05.949
I'm always dreaming of things to do.

21:06.089 --> 21:08.332
I always, as a kid, was a dreamer.

21:09.373 --> 21:20.203
And then the dreams led to certain consequences, that if you're going to live your dream, then the next phase is to prepare yourself.

21:20.864 --> 21:26.770
So I wanted to be an explorer from day one, and I wanted to be an ocean explorer, and so I said, well,

21:29.146 --> 21:30.808
Who's the closest to being that?

21:31.489 --> 21:34.512
They were basically cartographers, geographers.

21:34.533 --> 21:40.340
I mean, explorers are fundamentally into the geography of things, and they're navigators and that.

21:40.360 --> 21:46.187
So my father had a boat, so I was into navigation, and I was always interested in the bottom of the ocean.

21:46.227 --> 21:48.329
Whenever I was a kid, I'd hold my breath and I'd go down.

21:48.389 --> 21:49.811
As long as I could, I'd hold it.

21:49.831 --> 21:54.477
But then I began scuba diving, and I just, and I'd go down to the bottom.

21:54.977 --> 21:57.280
I wasn't interested in water, per se.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.547
I'm not interested in nauticalness.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.329
I'm not really interested in sailing.

22:02.369 --> 22:07.254
My wife grew up in Connecticut as a sailor, and she said, you should love sailing.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.897
I said, yeah, it's okay, but it's boring up here.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.599
I want to get down there.

22:12.639 --> 22:16.543
And so I was always fascinated with mountain ranges.

22:16.623 --> 22:18.525
I grew up in mountain ranges out on the West Coast.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.867
The Rocky Mountains are just breathtaking.

22:20.887 --> 22:23.470
Sierra Nevada is such a...

22:23.821 --> 22:26.204
complexity to a mountain range.

22:26.464 --> 22:31.330
If you're out in the Great Plains, it's nothingness for miles.

22:31.390 --> 22:33.852
In a mountain, every few inches it changes.

22:33.892 --> 22:38.618
There's something about mountains that are just really adventurous, wonderful places.

22:38.638 --> 22:40.340
Tell me about the mountains down below.

22:40.400 --> 22:49.390
Yeah, and then I heard as a kid there was a piece of artwork I saw very early in my life of the ocean drained.

22:50.686 --> 22:53.249
And there was this gigantic mountain range, and there was this big fish.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.393
I still have that picture, actually, in my trunk somewhere.

22:57.154 --> 23:00.158
But it shows a big fish sort of stranded on the land.

23:00.198 --> 23:01.319
You know, it's been stranded.

23:01.339 --> 23:10.711
But these people are hiking, literally with backpacks, and they're hiking across the ocean floor, and these incredible mountain ranges and canyons.

23:11.412 --> 23:17.419
And I have always carried that mental picture with me of this great mountain ranges.

23:18.074 --> 23:20.518
The biggest mountain ranges on Earth are under the ocean.

23:20.658 --> 23:22.020
And are they, in fact, mountains?

23:22.140 --> 23:23.161
Oh, they're gigantic.

23:23.181 --> 23:27.007
I mean, they would look... They'd take them out of the water, and they'd look just like mountains here.

23:27.027 --> 23:27.928
Yeah.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.554
Well, they won't have trees on them, but they'll have... They'll have Billy Coates here.

23:31.574 --> 23:32.575
You know, they'll smell.

23:33.336 --> 23:36.761
That's true scale.

23:36.781 --> 23:39.666
That's not an exaggeration.

23:39.686 --> 23:44.132
And that mountain range is 23% of the Earth.

23:45.580 --> 23:47.222
I mean, like a quarter of the planet.

23:47.663 --> 23:52.891
And yet, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong went to the moon before we went to that mountain.

23:52.911 --> 23:53.912
That's amazing.

23:53.932 --> 23:58.219
I mean, I think we had pretty well— They played golf on the moon before we went to the biggest mountain.

23:58.239 --> 23:58.760
That's a good line.

23:58.780 --> 24:02.605
And we had charted the far side of the moon, and we have pretty good— Maps.

24:03.046 --> 24:04.208
I mean, they landed and played golf.

24:04.228 --> 24:07.292
They were out there going— And we hadn't even been to the biggest mountain ranges on Earth.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.016
Well, maybe it wasn't sexy enough.

24:10.297 --> 24:14.423
You know, maybe it— Oh, I think we are definitely terrestrial beasts.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.123
the ocean still scares people.

24:17.143 --> 24:28.437
Now, in terms of prioritizing the most exciting and also the most important, clearly the highlight, the great celebrity has got to be this Titanic thing.

24:28.577 --> 24:31.261
I think you're more excited by these volcanoes.

24:31.481 --> 24:34.185
Yeah, hydrothermal vents and creatures.

24:34.685 --> 24:36.107
Going into this mountain range

24:36.577 --> 24:38.699
Plus, I did all of that before the Titanic.

24:38.739 --> 24:47.590
So that was my youthfulness, my virginity, was spent in the mountain ranges.

24:47.610 --> 24:52.175
And what I have been able to do is I can visualize.

24:53.336 --> 24:56.760
When I look at a map, I see it in three dimensions.

24:58.222 --> 25:00.565
It's just very useful.

25:00.785 --> 25:03.428
It's a skill that I don't know whether I developed or I always had.

25:03.813 --> 25:11.025
But when I'm diving, I can integrate all of what I see and build a mental image, and then work within that mental image.

25:11.045 --> 25:15.613
And so when I look out at the ocean, I don't see the water.

25:17.076 --> 25:18.619
I'm seeing the mountain ranges.

25:18.919 --> 25:23.587
The canyon's over there, and there's a big thing over there, and we'll go down into that valley.

25:24.108 --> 25:27.053
And so I'm sort of looking at it as if I'm in a helicopter.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.603
And then I go and I... People say, what's it like?

25:29.623 --> 25:35.370
I say, it's like exploring the Rocky Mountains at night in a snowstorm in a helicopter with a flashlight.

25:36.872 --> 25:38.374
That's basically it.

25:39.575 --> 25:49.728
So there's a lot of... Another thing that's really interesting, now that we've moved away from physical presence to telepresence, which I find superior.

25:49.868 --> 25:50.569
My next question.

25:50.989 --> 25:52.051
I actually find it better.

25:53.372 --> 25:57.057
And the reason is... Well, it's safer too, but...

25:57.458 --> 26:04.205
You go through the same, when you almost lose your robot, boy, your stomach bottom falls out.

26:04.225 --> 26:15.318
But the thing about these new robotic systems is that they can give you so much information, you can build a better image than you can looking out the window.

26:16.339 --> 26:22.506
You have so much more information at your fingertips as you're building this thing in your mind.

26:23.627 --> 26:25.609
Yes, you've got the windows, but you've got

26:26.129 --> 26:27.371
another view of yourself.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.733
You have a vehicle looking at you.

26:30.155 --> 26:40.070
This picture, for example, of Jason on the bottom working was taken by Medea.

26:40.811 --> 26:43.856
So you have what Jason sees, and then you have what Medea sees.

26:44.177 --> 26:52.930
So when you're in this control room— You have wind indicators, you have maps, you have so much data that

26:53.298 --> 27:03.049
And your anxiety level is, and you're uncomfortable, you're not, I mean, in a submarine you're really banging your head and you're doing, this is how you are in a submarine.

27:03.129 --> 27:12.439
And you're doing that, you know, and that just really cuts in on your ability to sense where you are and what you are.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.503
I had a couple of questions.

27:16.964 --> 27:22.950
And again, this is, I'm not going to make any comparisons with Sagan and outer space per se, but

27:23.403 --> 27:24.885
Some of the questions are interesting.

27:25.747 --> 27:32.057
He's a little bit older than you, but I could say, what do you expect to see in your lifetime, realistically?

27:32.077 --> 27:38.808
And he talks about the Big Bang, hoping perhaps to have some kind of confirmation.

27:38.828 --> 27:41.472
You know, you get it yourself.

27:41.492 --> 27:41.933
You're a young guy.

27:41.973 --> 27:50.466
You're still going to work at Woods Hole for another couple of years, and you're going to spend many fruitful years now in Mystic, which we will want to give a mention.

27:50.606 --> 27:51.047
Right, right.

27:51.820 --> 27:57.909
I know the work is spectacular, and you're committed to it, but what do you hope?

27:57.929 --> 28:01.594
I really got bit on marine archaeology.

28:03.456 --> 28:11.367
I am just fascinated by the amount of history that's in the ocean, preserved, well preserved.

28:11.387 --> 28:12.529
There's more history.

28:13.454 --> 28:16.978
preserved in the deep sea than all the museums of the world combined.

28:16.998 --> 28:21.704
And when we talk about history, we assume the recording of human events.

28:21.724 --> 28:23.246
Human history, human events.

28:23.266 --> 28:26.770
You're talking about man-made things that are documented.

28:26.990 --> 28:29.634
I'm moving away, I think, you know, plate tectonic.

28:31.436 --> 28:39.786
I mean, there was a period of time in the early part of my career when we were primitive, we were stone-aged on what we knew about the earth.

28:40.607 --> 28:41.368
I mean, when I was a

28:42.310 --> 28:44.292
In college, we didn't know the average up the ocean.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.676
We didn't know anything about plate tectonics.

28:47.716 --> 28:59.871
We believed in all this gobbledygook, the Marshall case, geostynclinal cycle, which was like memorizing some Masonic chant, you know, that was just sort of nonsensical.

29:00.671 --> 29:04.316
And all of a sudden, someone gave us the Rosetta Stone.

29:05.097 --> 29:09.702
Someone came in and all of a sudden, everything fell into place.

29:10.390 --> 29:16.503
And we went from a primitive understanding of the earth to a very sophisticated understanding.

29:16.523 --> 29:17.405
And that was very exciting.

29:18.888 --> 29:22.235
But it stuck in that excitement phase.

29:22.476 --> 29:30.272
I mean, I like to move far in thinking as opposed to this.

29:30.860 --> 29:56.580
incremental inch of the time which I think that's wonderful the people that do that it's just great but can you be a little bit specific about well we went from such a poor understanding of the earth to an incredibly good understanding then you saw that you could make comparable moves in other arenas I mean if you're an explorer you're not bound up to the subject matter

29:57.623 --> 30:06.691
I don't feel uncomfortable moving from geology to biology to maritime history to archaeology.

30:06.711 --> 30:12.777
Now, other people will feel uncomfortable with me doing that or getting into children's education.

30:14.399 --> 30:15.319
I mean, it's an adventure.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.483
And an adventure is a specific process.

30:20.845 --> 30:26.770
And so what's really... I'm more interested in the adventure than necessarily...

30:27.408 --> 30:28.269
where I'm going.

30:28.770 --> 30:32.676
Could you mention specifically in terms of archaeology?

30:33.157 --> 30:50.184
Well, if you look, for example, what if you were the representative of the premier archaeological community and I were to say, you know, I think there's a place where Bronze Age ships with their people and contents have been mummified.

30:51.486 --> 30:52.467
Are you talking hypothetically?

30:52.507 --> 30:53.469
No, I believe it.

30:54.310 --> 30:54.951
And they go,

30:56.332 --> 30:59.957
I mean, it's like that ice man that hatched out in Switzerland.

30:59.977 --> 31:00.378
Wow.

31:01.419 --> 31:02.401
The Black Sea.

31:03.762 --> 31:06.406
We haven't been able to get into the Black Sea because of the Cold War.

31:06.446 --> 31:07.988
The Russians roughed this up.

31:08.529 --> 31:13.176
It was their puddle of water, and you'd go in there, and they were going to make your life miserable and dead.

31:13.196 --> 31:20.206
But now that that's gone, the Black Sea is where Jason and the Argonauts went on their quest for the Golden Fleece.

31:20.907 --> 31:24.111
The Golden Fleece was actually in Soviet Georgia.

31:25.036 --> 31:26.918
where they used a sheepskin.

31:27.919 --> 31:32.905
They would take a sheepskin and weight it down with stones and pan for gold in the rivers.

31:33.646 --> 31:37.490
And the gold flecks, the fine gold flecks, would be trapped in the fleece.

31:38.071 --> 31:39.332
So he was on a raiding part.

31:39.372 --> 31:40.193
He was after gold.

31:40.614 --> 31:41.615
That's pure and simple.

31:42.135 --> 31:47.922
But his journey took him up through the Bosporus, along the northern coast of Turkey, up to Soviet Georgia, and then he escaped

31:48.323 --> 31:55.270
going straight across and up through the Danube, because they blocked him from getting out at the Bospa, so he had to go up the Danube and come back down to Macedonia.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.552
But anyway, that was 2000 B.C.

31:58.413 --> 32:03.659
The interesting thing about the Black Sea is that it's shaped like a bathtub.

32:03.679 --> 32:12.768
You go off the Crimea and it drops very quickly to 7,000 feet, and it's pretty much a flat bottom sea.

32:12.788 --> 32:15.951
It's down to 7,000, 6,000, 7,000 feet.

32:16.420 --> 32:19.104
Below 600 feet, it's dead.

32:20.667 --> 32:25.935
It has no oxygen, nor has ever had oxygen through recorded history.

32:26.175 --> 32:29.600
And so I've been working with Harvard for the last two years.

32:29.660 --> 32:30.842
No animals to eat anything?

32:31.243 --> 32:31.463
Nothing.

32:31.503 --> 32:32.124
Zero.

32:32.164 --> 32:32.685
Zip.

32:32.965 --> 32:33.626
There should be.

32:34.367 --> 32:41.038
There should be encapsulated late Bronze Age ships with the people draped over the oars.

32:41.218 --> 32:42.600
That's exciting.

32:42.620 --> 32:43.862
That's very exciting.

32:44.197 --> 32:47.421
And to be able to... It's not just a pipe dream.

32:47.441 --> 32:52.407
No, it should be statistically high probability, a very high statistical probability.

32:52.427 --> 32:53.568
And ships sink all the time.

32:53.588 --> 32:55.811
All the time, 1% in the deep sea.

32:56.031 --> 32:57.473
Maybe more then, too, probably.

32:57.493 --> 33:03.260
Well, maybe even more then, but the thing we're doing this summer on the Mediterranean is a warm-up.

33:03.861 --> 33:04.922
I'm practicing, actually.

33:05.002 --> 33:06.424
Have you got the permissions and stuff?

33:06.444 --> 33:06.845
Don't need it.

33:07.485 --> 33:07.926
It's high seas.

33:09.256 --> 33:12.559
It was always the high seas, it's just whether they were going to be rough or not.

33:12.580 --> 33:13.541
Be hospitable.

33:13.561 --> 33:14.682
Yeah, it's always the high seas.

33:15.483 --> 33:20.228
Anything beyond twelve miles is the high seas, so hundreds of miles across.

33:20.248 --> 33:26.935
But the thing we're doing this summer along the ancient Roman trade routes was this incredible submarine.

33:26.955 --> 33:29.758
This is Nemo's sub.

33:29.778 --> 33:30.398
There is one.

33:31.119 --> 33:31.780
There's this one.

33:32.801 --> 33:37.626
This is as close as you're going to get to Captain Nemo's sub.

33:39.277 --> 34:08.473
this guy it's unbelievable it's only 130 feet long it carries a crew of 11 and two scientists it has windows it has wheels and it has a nuclear power plant it stays down a month and you can just and so I'm going back to this place where I already know there are wrecks at the ISIS site where I found this Roman ship

34:08.707 --> 34:09.808
This is the one I found.

34:12.491 --> 34:14.173
This is actually the moment we found it.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.574
But this is Isis.

34:15.614 --> 34:17.676
This is the Roman ship.

34:17.696 --> 34:19.338
This is the top part of the galley.

34:19.578 --> 34:21.620
How did you determine the name Isis, by the way?

34:21.640 --> 34:23.562
The archaeologist picked it out of the hat.

34:23.663 --> 34:27.446
Isis was the goddess of good luck for sailors.

34:27.827 --> 34:29.328
Not so much for these guys.

34:30.089 --> 34:38.578
But in this area where we found Isis, we found an area of 20 square miles of ancient wreckage, and we recovered...

34:38.963 --> 34:49.053
We recovered selected samples, and we have now analyzed all those samples, and it spans six centuries, from 200 B.C.

34:49.073 --> 34:58.362
to 400 A.D., and the team of archaeologists think that there's at least six other ships right around this area.

34:58.382 --> 34:59.383
So that's where we're going.

34:59.783 --> 35:02.406
And then we'll go to the Black Sea the next year.

35:02.866 --> 35:04.268
All this data was being collected.

35:04.288 --> 35:05.489
Who's writing this up?

35:05.990 --> 35:07.131
Oh, all of us.

35:07.151 --> 35:08.532
I mean, it's all split up.

35:09.052 --> 35:10.134
on your specialty.

35:10.935 --> 35:23.272
Anna McCann, who's the project archaeologist, just published a beautiful book on all this called Deepwater Archaeology, and it talks about ISIS, and it talks about the debris field, and it predicts these six ships.

35:23.292 --> 35:32.986
And so we're going into that area in July, September, August, September, and map the whole 20 square miles.

35:33.026 --> 35:36.291
Now when you moved to Mystic in 97, I guess it is,

35:36.929 --> 35:39.933
Ninety-seven, right.

35:39.953 --> 35:41.234
I've created this new institute.

35:41.294 --> 35:44.919
Tell me about that and what you'll be doing there.

35:45.139 --> 35:50.165
All right, well, basically what has happened is I've been at Woods Hole thirty years.

35:51.307 --> 35:53.870
And, you know, it's time to move on.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.111
By as wonderful as it is.

35:55.832 --> 36:03.662
It's okay, but Woods Hole is still committed to its primary objectives—graduate research with MIT.

36:04.115 --> 36:07.119
and basic research in the fundamentals of the ocean.

36:08.220 --> 36:12.125
And I did that for 30 years, and I've lost my interest in that.

36:12.165 --> 36:13.927
I haven't lost interest.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.330
Other things have become more interesting to me.

36:16.750 --> 36:23.058
Pre-college education has become more interesting to me than graduate education, the whole Jason project.

36:23.899 --> 36:29.145
And social sciences have become more interesting to me than physical sciences.

36:29.165 --> 36:30.747
And so I needed a new home.

36:31.537 --> 36:36.402
Plus, I'm very interested in public education.

36:36.422 --> 36:38.685
The public's illiterate about the oceans.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.047
There is no exhibition.

36:41.468 --> 36:44.451
You almost put a period in your literature.

36:44.531 --> 36:45.232
A lot of that.

36:45.272 --> 36:46.813
I'm not asking for your comments.

36:47.234 --> 36:55.222
Well, there are no major exhibitions in the world that deal with the deep sea.

36:55.242 --> 36:57.385
Now, the public sees aquariums.

36:57.425 --> 37:00.548
They see fish, and they see light, and they think the ocean is.

37:01.017 --> 37:01.798
100 feet deep.

37:02.598 --> 37:02.959
That's it.

37:03.439 --> 37:06.262
They don't realize that most of the planet is in darkness.

37:06.322 --> 37:07.583
What a great idea.

37:07.603 --> 37:14.569
And so that whole thing with Connecticut was the governor wanted me to build this exhibition center.

37:14.629 --> 37:15.910
So he gave us $30 million.

37:16.171 --> 37:19.073
And we have to raise this other $15 million.

37:19.113 --> 37:20.034
They've got half of it.

37:20.094 --> 37:21.155
That's $45 million.

37:22.036 --> 37:23.998
And it will open in the spring of 1998.

37:24.078 --> 37:29.843
And you will make a simulated dive to 12,000 feet and visit the mountain ranges, visit the Idrisomal Benz.

37:30.076 --> 37:32.558
visit the Titanic, visit archaeology.

37:33.099 --> 37:35.021
And that'll be a wonderful experience.

37:35.121 --> 37:37.784
It'll be a half-an-hour, 45-minute experience for people.

37:38.765 --> 37:41.948
And it also provides me with funding for my team.

37:42.729 --> 37:45.071
See, I've been on soft money for 30 years.

37:45.852 --> 37:48.034
Absolutely no hard money support.

37:48.054 --> 37:53.620
And this exhibition center will help support my team so that I can mount expeditions.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.421
I love that mystic aquarium.

37:55.642 --> 37:58.024
My wife and I, we love aquarium.

37:58.342 --> 37:59.563
Well, I grew up in it.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.687
I trained dolphins when I was in graduate school.

38:03.127 --> 38:04.288
They have a nice attitude there.

38:04.308 --> 38:06.831
It is not just inside looking at fish.

38:07.031 --> 38:07.251
No.

38:08.192 --> 38:13.878
And they obviously have extended their arms to me.

38:13.898 --> 38:14.739
And it's really nice.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.881
You might even attract as many people as the casino.

38:16.921 --> 38:17.482
You never know.

38:17.582 --> 38:18.183
You never know.

38:18.203 --> 38:20.185
But we'll certainly attract a bunch.

38:20.845 --> 38:25.070
But the idea is that that will be sort of my home base for my expedition.

38:25.090 --> 38:26.251
You're going to move down there?

38:26.291 --> 38:26.952
Yep.

38:27.012 --> 38:28.213
Probably in two years.

38:28.733 --> 38:32.899
But that's also where this submarine's based, at Groton.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.381
So everything's right there.

38:35.583 --> 38:38.147
And so we begin this summer with our first adventure.

38:39.188 --> 38:43.755
And we also are developing an excavation capability with a nuclear submarine so it can excavate.

38:44.776 --> 38:46.959
No one has ever done a deep water excavation.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.982
And what would that involve?

38:49.343 --> 38:57.795
Pumping HUD, the length of the sub, and then documenting electronically everything in a three-dimensional reference plane.

38:58.214 --> 38:59.976
So we're going to practice that next year.

39:01.037 --> 39:02.758
Harvard's building us a whole bunch of artifacts.

39:03.319 --> 39:05.440
Remember that Glomar Explorer?

39:05.621 --> 39:06.421
Oh, yeah?

39:06.441 --> 39:09.164
Was that a primitive attempt at excavation?

39:09.584 --> 39:10.445
Well, that was raising.

39:10.485 --> 39:11.146
That was lifting.

39:11.246 --> 39:13.187
Well, they were going to take the whole sub up.

39:13.227 --> 39:14.188
Yeah, they lifted.

39:14.348 --> 39:15.630
They couldn't excavate.

39:15.650 --> 39:16.851
They just grew forth.

39:17.391 --> 39:18.732
They blew it.

39:18.772 --> 39:20.034
They blew it.

39:20.054 --> 39:21.695
They claimed they blew it.

39:22.155 --> 39:23.977
They blew it.

39:23.997 --> 39:25.018
They did, actually.

39:25.298 --> 39:26.179
They blew it.

39:26.294 --> 39:29.257
They only got the front half, or the front third.

39:30.859 --> 39:34.843
So they didn't get the encrypting machines and all the stuff they really wanted.

39:35.743 --> 39:38.166
They got a guy holding onto a code book.

39:38.326 --> 39:39.747
That's fine.

39:39.767 --> 39:47.155
This lieutenant laying in his bunk, holding on, clutching this journal that had a lot of information.

39:47.795 --> 39:51.179
I don't know if it's worth a billion dollars.

39:51.199 --> 39:55.423
It was a billion or something.

39:55.960 --> 40:01.750
I just think that I can make a... Where do you make... You know, you always say, where can you make a contribution?

40:01.810 --> 40:06.939
Where's the best... Sort of like you, you say, well, I'd rather write for someone where I have a bigger outlet.

40:06.979 --> 40:11.727
You know, if my job is to get things out, naturally you want to have as broad an outlet as you can.

40:11.947 --> 40:13.370
You want to maximize your energy.

40:13.991 --> 40:20.061
And so I look and say, well, you know, I could go on doing a lot of things, but what do I...

40:20.615 --> 40:22.438
where could I really make a contribution?

40:22.458 --> 40:25.322
And I think I can really make a contribution.

40:25.342 --> 40:30.168
And so, plus it's challenging, it's new, it'll cause me to learn.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.072
I'm learning a lot.

40:33.092 --> 40:35.976
Isn't it wonderful to have a profession that causes you to learn?

40:36.337 --> 40:39.461
It causes you to learn and that you love doing.

40:39.501 --> 40:39.761
Yeah.

40:39.862 --> 40:49.575
I mean, I sit in my library now, reading the Punic Wars, you know, and the Battle of Salamis, and the Battle of Ignomus, and the Battle of Actium, and

40:50.095 --> 40:52.038
And I want to do all of those.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.541
But I'm sitting there just reading.

40:53.601 --> 40:55.063
This is how it starts then.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.126
You go and you read these stories.

40:57.146 --> 40:59.771
They're great stories.

40:59.971 --> 41:01.774
They're pretty accurate, aren't they?

41:01.794 --> 41:02.695
Oh, and they're very good.

41:03.376 --> 41:11.950
But the whole key is to take a good story that's already a good story and then add to it.

41:11.990 --> 41:14.955
And then you get to tell the whole story all over again.

41:15.273 --> 41:21.540
I mean, if you look at the books I've written, you know, I went out and added a final chapter, but then I got to tell the whole story all over again.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.522
The Titanic's a great story.

41:23.542 --> 41:25.144
The Bismarck's a great story.

41:25.204 --> 41:26.966
The Lusitania is a great story.

41:27.127 --> 41:32.252
Well, you went out trying—there was kind of a political edge to the Lusitania thing.

41:32.272 --> 41:36.377
Well, I wanted to— Did you actually prove that as soon as I put anything like that?

41:36.537 --> 41:38.359
I just figured I could prove it one way or the other.

41:39.401 --> 41:40.622
You feel that you did?

41:40.838 --> 41:41.659
Oh, God, yes.

41:41.779 --> 41:45.562
And what was there about the wreck that documented that for you?

41:45.582 --> 41:47.304
Well, the magazine didn't explode.

41:48.325 --> 42:00.376
We were able to go out, because of the technology, and we were able to go out with the detailed engineering drawings of the ship on a CAT scan, on AutoCAD, on AutoCAD.

42:00.977 --> 42:04.140
So we had the whole engineering drawings of the ship on a computer.

42:04.780 --> 42:09.765
We then went out, and because we could track our robot so precisely, we can track our sensors

42:10.117 --> 42:13.221
on our robots, ten times a second to a centimeter.

42:14.042 --> 42:21.491
So we were able to go out and create a three-dimensional form of the Lusitania as it now rests on the bottom.

42:22.031 --> 42:31.663
We were able then to superimpose and skew the engineering drawings, the fit, because the Lusitania jackknife is broken right from the same place Titanic broke.

42:31.723 --> 42:34.306
It seems to be a common weakness.

42:34.326 --> 42:37.710
And so the Lusitania on the bottom is sort of shaped like a banana.

42:38.163 --> 42:43.368
And we were able to take all the engineering drawings and shape them and put them on that ship.

42:43.428 --> 42:46.530
Did they have expansion joints on those, like they have with carriers?

42:46.550 --> 42:46.811
Yeah, yeah.

42:46.831 --> 42:47.511
So that's probably what it is.

42:47.711 --> 42:48.032
Oh, yeah.

42:48.052 --> 42:50.153
Well, Titanic had expansion joints.

42:50.173 --> 42:57.580
But anyway, the point is that we now knew within a centimeter where the magazine was.

42:57.600 --> 43:06.988
And we were then able to go down, and because the magazine was up in the bow, even though the ship was laying on the starboard side where the torpedo hit, we could get in underneath.

43:07.154 --> 43:09.638
Because it was off the bottom.

43:10.078 --> 43:12.562
The magazine was lifted off the bottom.

43:12.843 --> 43:21.236
So we could go in underneath with robots and completely map and visually inspect the entire magazine.

43:22.478 --> 43:23.058
That was fine.

43:23.519 --> 43:25.102
Absolutely nothing happened to it.

43:25.963 --> 43:29.989
The whole conspiracy theory was that the torpedo hit the magazine and the magazine exploded.

43:31.505 --> 43:35.591
We have gorgeous pictures of an intact magazine.

43:35.792 --> 43:36.553
So forget that.

43:36.933 --> 43:42.242
And so you're only left with two other possibilities, coal dust explosion and boiler explosion.

43:42.903 --> 43:49.593
Well, there were people in all the boilers that survived and said the boilers didn't explode while they were standing next to them.

43:49.994 --> 43:56.845
Yeah, you have eyewitness accounts that were leaning on the boilers and said that one didn't explode, and you had them from all three boiler rooms.

43:57.265 --> 43:59.048
The fourth boiler room was turned off.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.623
Amazing the discovery of that boiler from Titanic.

44:02.643 --> 44:03.284
Yeah.

44:03.304 --> 44:04.806
I mean, that was just bingo.

44:05.747 --> 44:06.568
And we went over that.

44:06.648 --> 44:08.410
It was like Titanic.

44:08.531 --> 44:09.592
It was like a big sign.

44:09.612 --> 44:10.973
It's just approaching.

44:11.754 --> 44:14.037
The whole concept of the debris field.

44:14.778 --> 44:15.038
Yeah.

44:15.219 --> 44:17.281
Well, that was the strategy that made it work.

44:17.301 --> 44:19.283
See, everyone else had tried these other ways.

44:19.364 --> 44:26.092
And it was because of the thresher and scorpion when I was trying to map the thresher.

44:26.112 --> 44:27.313
And I couldn't get closure.

44:28.171 --> 44:31.035
Because I just had this simple view that it was just a circle.

44:32.557 --> 44:35.340
I didn't think about it, because I'd never done one before.

44:36.121 --> 44:38.444
And so then I was just going to get closure on the circles.

44:38.464 --> 44:41.048
I said, see, the Navy wanted 100% coverage.

44:42.610 --> 44:44.592
So I said, okay.

44:44.612 --> 44:54.525
So I began doing the systematic coverage, and then I couldn't get, this is going on for a long time.

44:54.806 --> 44:55.967
Went out over a mile.

44:57.010 --> 45:01.458
And then I looked at the size of the particles, and just the physics kicked in.

45:02.760 --> 45:03.141
Of course.

45:03.521 --> 45:07.268
You know, when I was at OCS in the late 60s, I knew all about SOSUS and this.

45:07.308 --> 45:11.736
I didn't realize that this Thresher thing was hurt and everything.

45:11.756 --> 45:13.419
It must have been this cataclysm weapon.

45:13.639 --> 45:13.859
Oh, yeah.

45:13.880 --> 45:19.289
Well, Scorpion, because the Thresher, they knew where it was, because they had a ship, an ASR, sitting on top of it.

45:20.030 --> 45:22.174
But the Scorpion vanished on War Patrol.

45:23.065 --> 45:28.792
And so they had to look at the SOSUS data and triangulate, and bingo, there it was.

45:28.812 --> 45:29.353
I read something.

45:29.373 --> 45:33.118
They really cost everything that was spent for that SOSUS.

45:33.198 --> 45:36.682
I read in the New York Times and maybe some peacetime application.

45:36.702 --> 45:37.183
Oh, whale.

45:37.303 --> 45:41.168
All of a sudden, they've been able to show that there's more whales than we thought.

45:42.790 --> 45:46.595
They're great for monitoring whales.

45:46.615 --> 45:49.318
I don't know if it's worth that much money.

45:49.378 --> 45:50.119
Well, it's a whale.

45:50.302 --> 45:52.385
It's there, and it's a question of maintenance.

45:52.525 --> 45:53.526
I know it's the CIA.

45:53.546 --> 45:56.250
Well, this is, I think... Stuff for mammograms.

45:56.490 --> 45:58.052
Right, the software for mammograms.

45:58.072 --> 45:59.875
Yeah, it makes sense, doesn't it?

45:59.895 --> 46:00.115
Why not?

46:00.175 --> 46:00.896
Image processing.

46:00.916 --> 46:01.777
It's too bad.

46:01.797 --> 46:04.421
Well, and here's the Navy letting us use the NR-1.

46:04.501 --> 46:05.242
That's great.

46:05.262 --> 46:11.891
So I think, too, that one of the reasons the Navy lets us do these things is because we push the technology.

46:12.752 --> 46:14.595
We're not satisfied.

46:14.615 --> 46:18.520
They say, well, I've got this sonar, and I say, well, let's push it to its limits.

46:19.580 --> 46:24.787
Whereas another guy says they just use it to say whether this is a Soviet sub or not, and it's sort of yes or no.

46:25.528 --> 46:29.393
And we're trying to push these sensor systems way beyond what they were designed to do.

46:29.814 --> 46:34.159
Let's do two things and then we can wrap it up.

46:34.179 --> 46:34.279
Okay.

46:34.299 --> 46:35.181
Maybe three things.

46:35.201 --> 46:42.490
I read one piece where—and I didn't know that you would have to say, actually, like, this was a lot of this.

46:42.510 --> 46:43.231
Oh, yeah.

46:43.251 --> 46:45.334
I mean, was it— Well, National Geographic—

46:46.630 --> 46:50.615
They didn't want to necessarily say they were looking for the monster.

46:51.096 --> 46:54.119
So they developed a program to document the phenomena.

46:55.401 --> 47:00.487
And they came to me and said, would I help out in mapping the lock?

47:00.508 --> 47:01.549
And wouldn't it be great if?

47:01.949 --> 47:03.151
Yeah, I thought, well, yeah.

47:03.391 --> 47:10.620
Well, they offered to fly my wife and I over to Scotland, and they rented a castle, and they made it worthwhile.

47:11.301 --> 47:12.443
And so I said, sure.

47:12.463 --> 47:15.186
So I went back and looked at the databases.

47:15.622 --> 47:20.327
And the only database they had on the lock was lead line soundings done by John Murray.

47:20.447 --> 47:24.131
And John Murray was very famous, or John Murray, from the Challenger expedition.

47:24.672 --> 47:28.716
And he'd gone into Loch Ness, and he'd done a systematic lead line sounding.

47:29.276 --> 47:31.999
And he had maybe 700 lead line soundings.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.322
And that's what I started with.

47:34.342 --> 47:37.605
So I went in, and I figured that I knew the lock was there.

47:38.446 --> 47:40.388
So my job wasn't to look for the monster.

47:40.428 --> 47:43.992
My job was to map the lock and then superimpose

47:45.102 --> 47:47.565
observations over that and see if it made any sense.

47:48.787 --> 47:50.149
So I went in with a ship.

47:50.249 --> 47:57.438
I brought in a ship, and we systematically mapped, echo sounding, and I drew this bathymetric map of the lock.

47:58.359 --> 48:02.465
In the first place, the lock is a U-shaped, it used to be a V-shaped.

48:02.725 --> 48:05.248
It's on a great fault, the Great Glen Fault.

48:05.269 --> 48:10.215
And that was caused by the closing of the Atlantic Ocean, and then there was this big fault created.

48:10.786 --> 48:17.414
And then during the Ice Age, the glaciers followed that fault and gouged it out and made this U-shape.

48:17.474 --> 48:19.336
So Loch Ness is basically like that.

48:19.997 --> 48:21.078
So it's solid rock.

48:21.599 --> 48:24.863
There's very little sediments in Loch Ness.

48:24.883 --> 48:29.088
So I said, well, look, there's no sediments in Loch Ness.

48:29.108 --> 48:32.171
The water is saturating calcium carbonate.

48:32.191 --> 48:33.873
There's got to be bones.

48:33.893 --> 48:37.958
If you can't get the one that's alive, you've got to get its mom and dad.

48:39.001 --> 48:44.606
And so if you look at—the first sighting was 1525.

48:46.507 --> 48:49.610
Well, there's got to be—this can't be the same guy.

48:50.051 --> 48:55.615
I mean, first place, if the Loch Ness Monster exists, then it's going to obey the laws of physics.

48:55.695 --> 49:00.059
It's not going to have some special law, so it's going to obey everyone else.

49:00.660 --> 49:08.046
To have one—if you talk to populationists about creatures—to have one Loch Ness Monster, you have 25.

49:08.279 --> 49:11.002
at least, to sustain the population.

49:11.022 --> 49:12.244
You can't just have one.

49:13.585 --> 49:23.097
So, if there's 25 of them, at least, minimum, at any one time, and they've been around since 1525, there's a lot of dead monsters down there.

49:24.419 --> 49:30.606
So I said, I'm going to dredge the length of Loch Ness, dredge it, and try to get bones.

49:31.527 --> 49:33.029
And I got all sorts of crap.

49:33.189 --> 49:37.274
I got everything you could think of but monster bones.

49:37.294 --> 49:37.915
And so...

49:38.519 --> 49:42.505
Right away I said, you know, that can't be.

49:42.865 --> 49:43.566
But this was fun.

49:43.646 --> 49:44.267
It was fun.

49:44.347 --> 49:45.489
It was a detective story.

49:45.509 --> 49:48.573
I mean, you had to make a first—it's like science, you make assumptions.

49:48.593 --> 49:54.201
You must have gone in with expecting—this is one of those things where you're basically expecting not to find anything.

49:54.221 --> 50:00.570
Well, I just said, look, a scientist, a good scientist, has no vested interest in the answer.

50:00.610 --> 50:01.772
You don't carry baggage.

50:01.792 --> 50:02.993
You just want to know the answer.

50:03.113 --> 50:04.736
You don't care what it is.

50:04.756 --> 50:07.800
And an explorer doesn't have a care—

50:08.607 --> 50:10.089
He doesn't want to shape it.

50:10.369 --> 50:12.912
He just doesn't have a change, just what is.

50:13.813 --> 50:18.138
And so if you look at it that way, like, you know, I don't care if it exists, it exists.

50:18.198 --> 50:19.200
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.041
I just want to know the truth.

50:21.202 --> 50:22.223
And so I don't care.

50:22.483 --> 50:26.889
If I drag up this femur bone, hey, great.

50:27.069 --> 50:28.030
You know, won't that be great?

50:28.070 --> 50:30.633
I'll probably be the only person who really has real proof.

50:31.294 --> 50:32.255
And if I don't, I don't.

50:32.996 --> 50:36.420
And so, yeah, I had a great summer, and I walked away saying...

50:37.058 --> 50:39.742
You know who else worked on that and I interviewed him?

50:39.802 --> 50:40.844
Doc Edgerton.

50:41.244 --> 50:41.585
Yeah.

50:41.825 --> 50:42.687
And he took a picture.

50:43.468 --> 50:44.930
I think he may have believed in it.

50:44.950 --> 50:46.693
I didn't.

50:47.033 --> 50:51.781
When I walked away from it, I went in there neutral and walked away saying it.

50:51.801 --> 50:53.083
In fact, I did a fun thing there.

50:53.103 --> 50:54.205
It was really fun.

50:54.225 --> 50:56.668
I made monsters of sightings.

50:56.949 --> 50:59.192
There was a camp, a campsite.

50:59.212 --> 51:05.462
And because the block was steep walled, if you drove your boat just right

51:06.522 --> 51:15.558
On a nice day, you could create a wake, and the wake would go out, bounce off the wall, come back, and now you've been gone a half an hour.

51:16.339 --> 51:19.885
And you'll get a standing wave that comes in, and you get an interference pattern.

51:20.306 --> 51:22.049
For a few minutes, you'll have three humps.

51:23.812 --> 51:24.774
And then it disappears.

51:25.555 --> 51:27.839
And the siding phone started ringing.

51:27.859 --> 51:31.045
And I would purposely go down and create these things.

51:31.362 --> 51:34.044
And then all the phone calls would come.

51:34.445 --> 51:36.046
You may even have the answer right there.

51:36.146 --> 51:39.849
I think there's certainly a very reason.

51:39.869 --> 51:45.634
Because we were able to make a three-humped monster that could sustain itself for about a minute.

51:47.576 --> 51:54.142
And it looked pretty... And there was no obvious reason, because the ship had long gone.

51:54.642 --> 51:57.965
Because it took that long for the wake to go all the way out, bound.

51:57.985 --> 52:00.287
You've got this enclosed body.

52:00.307 --> 52:00.407
Yeah.

52:00.758 --> 52:03.301
So I walked away saying, I think that's the monster.

52:04.983 --> 52:09.788
And just quickly, you did mention it earlier about this concept of telepresence.

52:11.130 --> 52:14.434
Well, I think we're going to do it from a house.

52:14.454 --> 52:26.327
I'm convinced that in about ten years Hertz will rent robots on the information highway, and you will travel electronically from your house, and you will think you're there.

52:26.695 --> 52:30.601
you'll have such an incredibly good... Satan perceives the same thing in the heavens, by the way.

52:30.721 --> 52:32.163
Well, I think it's only logical.

52:32.183 --> 52:40.735
See, what's really nice about Earth, as opposed to the heavens, there's nothing on Earth more than a quarter second away by hard wire.

52:42.578 --> 52:47.265
If you wire the Earth with fiber, there's nothing more than a quarter second away.

52:48.647 --> 52:54.736
And so, all of a sudden, you can sit in your home, and you'll have an electronic IMAX theater.

52:55.336 --> 52:56.398
I call it the home dome.

52:57.172 --> 53:02.137
And you'll sit there and you'll rent robots.

53:02.157 --> 53:04.219
For an hour, you go to the Serengeti.

53:04.559 --> 53:07.262
Then Janie will want to go somewhere else, so you go to the Louvre.

53:08.163 --> 53:09.925
And then you'll go to the Titanic.

53:09.965 --> 53:14.990
That's why I wanted it to be preserved, because I felt people would visit it, like the Arizona.

53:16.532 --> 53:19.034
I just—you go to the Galapagos Islands.

53:19.054 --> 53:20.055
How about the Mary Rose?

53:20.636 --> 53:22.658
That was where— A mistake, as far as raising it.

53:22.738 --> 53:23.138
Really?

53:23.158 --> 53:25.761
Yeah, now they're just stuck with trying to keep it wet.

53:27.108 --> 53:29.652
I don't believe in raising wooden ships.

53:30.013 --> 53:34.500
So that should have been your view?

53:35.883 --> 53:44.096
Margaret Rule is a wonderful person, but I think that if you properly protect a spot, you can make it, you know, visit it where it is.

53:44.196 --> 53:47.742
I think Gettysburg is more compelling than Gettysburg.

53:47.762 --> 53:53.031
I think walking the battlefield of the Little Bighorn and seeing where they buried the soldiers where they fell,

53:53.703 --> 54:12.330
to walk through where Bantene dug in and Reno tried to repel the Indians and how just a short amount of topography blocked their visual view of Custer, the terrain there where he couldn't really run, he had to dismount, and it was really hard to get through that Badlands terrain.

54:13.252 --> 54:16.216
To walk that battlefield and read about it, then it came to life.

54:16.236 --> 54:20.402
And this whole concept of telepresence does make these in situ museums

54:21.091 --> 54:25.077
Very, very... That's why I'm going out to Titanic's sister this summer.

54:26.018 --> 54:30.164
Titanic had two sisters, the Olympic and the Gigantic.

54:30.184 --> 54:35.351
And they renamed the Gigantic because it was a little... They were embarrassed after the Titanic, so they renamed it the Britannic.

54:36.393 --> 54:39.798
And it was sunk by the Germans during the Battle of Gallipoli.

54:39.858 --> 54:47.589
It was on its way to the Bosporus, and it was sunk by a German... They don't know whether it was a mine or you will, but it was sunk off Greece.

54:48.370 --> 54:49.191
And it's intact...

54:49.458 --> 54:51.140
It's the largest luxury liner on the bottom.

54:51.160 --> 54:54.143
It's completely intact, and nothing's been taken from it.

54:54.804 --> 54:56.066
And only Cousteau has seen it.

54:56.486 --> 54:57.628
He's the only person that's seen it.

54:58.489 --> 55:00.070
And so we're going to go in, and we're going to map it.

55:00.090 --> 55:02.974
But the thing about that is it's four miles from shore.

55:03.755 --> 55:05.176
And he's the only one that's seen it?

55:05.196 --> 55:06.037
Well, he and his crew.

55:06.057 --> 55:07.679
They've only been visited once.

55:08.040 --> 55:08.320
Why?

55:09.541 --> 55:10.563
The others don't know where it is.

55:10.863 --> 55:12.225
No.

55:12.565 --> 55:14.587
I don't know.

55:14.607 --> 55:14.968
It's deep.

55:15.288 --> 55:18.672
It's 400 feet, so it's beyond normal depths.

55:19.259 --> 55:21.161
I don't know, but I'm going to spend the summer on it.

55:21.181 --> 55:21.922
We're going to map it.

55:21.942 --> 55:23.664
We're going to do a beautiful color mosaic.

55:24.245 --> 55:25.706
But here's the point.

55:26.607 --> 55:31.733
Four miles from shore means I could lay a cable to it, put robots on it, and you could visit it.

55:32.894 --> 55:37.579
So it's a very strong candidate for an institute museum.

55:37.659 --> 55:38.621
So is Guadalcanal.

55:38.781 --> 55:39.802
So is Lusitania.

55:39.822 --> 55:42.164
Lusitania is only 12 miles from shore.

55:42.184 --> 55:48.051
So I think you're going to have Arizona's memorials underwater.

55:48.267 --> 55:49.729
I mean, Arizona's underwater as it is.

55:50.670 --> 55:51.250
It's right there.

55:51.270 --> 55:52.572
It's right there, but it's underwater.

55:53.553 --> 55:57.877
And people go to it, and they don't see anything with a little oil cloud.

55:57.897 --> 55:58.438
But they're there.

55:59.959 --> 56:05.425
And I think— I wonder now, are sailors' remains still there?

56:05.445 --> 56:06.787
I mean, I wonder— And the Arizona?

56:06.847 --> 56:10.050
I wonder about the propriety of going down and looking at their— Oh, the Arizona.

56:10.410 --> 56:11.912
Well, I think—

56:12.280 --> 56:16.204
I think in the Arizona's case there's probably still bodies inside.

56:16.264 --> 56:20.588
I mean, I think there'd be some questions of propriety in the Arizona's case, wouldn't you think?

56:20.608 --> 56:25.453
Well, but I'm saying I'm going to replicate the Arizona experience.

56:25.473 --> 56:25.934
I see.

56:26.074 --> 56:28.657
You don't necessarily have to go inside, although you could.

56:28.717 --> 56:37.726
See, if you look at the Britannic, it had 500 rooms, and those rooms are sealed and anaerobic.

56:37.746 --> 56:38.747
They should be preserved.

56:39.648 --> 56:41.950
You should be able to go in and do maid service.

56:42.588 --> 56:46.532
and clean them, and then access them.

56:46.552 --> 56:47.994
Because they've been sealed.

56:48.795 --> 56:50.076
Watertight integrity.

56:50.096 --> 56:58.245
Well, any water goes in, the oxygen's used up, and now you only have diffusion to replace the oxygen, which is very inefficient.

56:58.265 --> 57:01.068
So in the deep bowels of the ship, it should be anaerobic.

57:01.088 --> 57:01.728
Wow.

57:01.748 --> 57:02.710
Yeah.

57:02.730 --> 57:03.010
Wow.

57:04.632 --> 57:09.697
So those would be really good candidates for museums in situ.

57:10.137 --> 57:11.599
And the technology's there.

57:12.187 --> 57:16.731
A fiber optic cable, four miles, is a slam dunk.

57:16.751 --> 57:20.975
And the companies that you've formed, will they work in this?

57:21.195 --> 57:22.657
Yeah, probably.

57:23.558 --> 57:25.679
My Odyssey company, probably.

57:26.160 --> 57:30.384
We're also looking at launching a cable channel called Nautica that's all water-related.

57:31.245 --> 57:39.052
Again, what I'm trying to do is to build an infrastructure to support what I want to do so that I can have fun.

57:39.112 --> 57:40.193
Would you inscribe this for me?

57:40.213 --> 57:40.593
You bet.

57:40.813 --> 57:41.434
No problem.

57:42.342 --> 57:43.999
Good interview, thank you.
