WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:31.708
Just that way it'll save me time from... You're saying it, we're talking Abel from Orlando, and you said you're talking about in this room or... Yeah, this is what I call my study, which is a sort of a euphemistic term, but it's the room which contains bibliographies, bearing on the books in my library, books about books, catalogs of important sales,

00:33.325 --> 00:41.415
far more important than anything in my library, but sales that in some degree at least are comparable to some of the books that I have.

00:42.556 --> 00:43.978
Some of them are historic sales.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.581
Many of them are historic sales.

00:46.601 --> 00:47.483
And books of reference.

00:49.906 --> 01:01.560
And to me it's important because it tells me the political and economic and social circumstances that produced the books in the other room.

01:03.042 --> 01:18.864
When I read Milton's poems, the 1645 edition, I'd like to know something about the historical circumstances and the climate of opinion during which time he wrote the book.

01:18.884 --> 01:20.347
Otherwise it doesn't mean anything to me.

01:20.367 --> 01:21.909
So that's what you get in this room?

01:21.929 --> 01:24.953
That's what I get in this room.

01:24.973 --> 01:32.003
I want to know the social, the economic, the political circumstances of the books.

01:32.540 --> 01:33.741
This is where the work is done.

01:34.022 --> 01:35.604
This is where the work is done.

01:35.624 --> 01:38.046
And then you go in there to appreciate and disable it.

01:38.066 --> 01:38.907
And I take it out.

01:39.148 --> 01:40.249
I'm relearning Latin.

01:41.931 --> 01:51.502
And because many of, especially of the, nearly all of the Incanabula, except for the Caxton, are in Latin or in Italian or in German.

01:52.664 --> 01:56.788
And being able to, I understand that.

01:56.808 --> 02:00.673
It means something more to me than just being an icon or an artifact.

02:02.645 --> 02:05.548
Well, it's a living thing for you, then, a book, I guess.

02:05.748 --> 02:09.092
As you say, a book becomes a living thing for you.

02:09.112 --> 02:09.592
Exactly.

02:09.973 --> 02:11.654
Otherwise, it would mean nothing to me.

02:12.836 --> 02:21.224
I mean, otherwise, I might just as well go to a museum and look at some of these books or to a great university or institutional library.

02:22.365 --> 02:28.652
But if I'm going to have them on my shelves, I want to know something about them more than just their

02:29.003 --> 02:58.993
how rare they are if they are or who wrote them I want to know how do they happen to come into being what circumstances produce them does it matter to have something when did you decide that having the earliest possible edition meant something obviously you read the books in here but but but does it mean something to read them in its earliest edition for you yes

03:00.661 --> 03:08.875
It brings me into that time warp, if you will, that time frame in which the book was written.

03:10.698 --> 03:17.390
You get a special feeling, I'm sure, that Milton's poems have been reprinted hundreds of times.

03:19.393 --> 03:24.542
But if I pick up the copy which is in my library,

03:27.847 --> 03:30.310
I'm holding in my hand a 17th century book.

03:30.350 --> 03:36.196
This is the book that he may have seen, in this case he did not, may have seen through the press.

03:38.658 --> 03:45.846
It's important to me because this connects me in a very special way with the author.

03:45.866 --> 03:50.611
It gives me a better appreciation of what he's trying to say.

03:51.652 --> 03:54.155
It's almost like my having a conversation with you here.

03:55.837 --> 03:57.178
Instead of on the telephone,

03:57.935 --> 03:59.757
or via correspondence.

04:00.759 --> 04:03.082
There's something personal about this kind of thing.

04:03.663 --> 04:07.327
Since John Milton can't be brought back to life, his book.

04:08.349 --> 04:15.859
You see, the title of my new book is going to have a Milton quote, Life Beyond Life, which is from the Ariel Paginica.

04:15.879 --> 04:19.764
You know, he said, the precious life, the blood of a master spirit, which is what a book is.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.486
He talked about the book as being precious.

04:21.586 --> 04:23.689
Which gives you a life beyond life.

04:24.108 --> 04:29.156
The book allows you to have a life beyond life, and that's exactly what you're saying right now.

04:29.476 --> 04:33.763
The fact that Milton is able to live 300 or so years later.

04:36.107 --> 04:38.831
That's why this room is important to me.

04:38.891 --> 04:51.651
Maybe more important, I think I would be able to survive in a literary sense much better in this room, much as I love the books in the other room.

04:52.508 --> 04:56.273
But I connect with these books in a very intimate, a very special way.

04:56.313 --> 05:03.283
And if I didn't have the other books, I could still enjoy reading about them, studying them.

05:03.423 --> 05:05.866
I like the idea of connecting with them on a personal level.

05:06.046 --> 05:11.193
So what comes first, the studying of the book and then the acquisition of it as a treat for yourself?

05:11.254 --> 05:14.959
Or do you acquire the book and then try to learn as much as you can about it?

05:15.800 --> 05:18.744
Well, it's been a two-way street.

05:18.764 --> 05:20.406
Sometimes I acquire the book first.

05:20.825 --> 05:23.828
because I read it in college or in high school or something.

05:25.109 --> 05:32.776
Take John Milton, since I'm talking about Milton, and then acquire material about Milton in this room.

05:34.137 --> 05:41.724
Sometimes, as a result of my readings here, I have been tempted to, you ask me, but what's on my want list?

05:44.827 --> 05:50.292
My readings here on science, both from catalogs and from books of reference,

05:51.014 --> 05:56.280
has triggered my desire to have a Copernicus in first edition.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.525
Now you've said that three times today, so this must really be burning on you to get a Copernicus.

06:02.526 --> 06:02.887
It is.

06:03.047 --> 06:03.567
It is.

06:05.149 --> 06:06.150
You know Haskell Norman?

06:06.791 --> 06:07.011
Yes.

06:07.351 --> 06:09.093
I know his son, Jeremy.

06:09.133 --> 06:10.074
Jeremy is his son.

06:10.475 --> 06:11.235
I don't know Haskell.

06:11.255 --> 06:14.859
Haskell believes that to be the one great book he's never been able to get.

06:15.380 --> 06:16.421
Has not been able to get it?

06:16.461 --> 06:18.123
He has not been able to get it.

06:18.143 --> 06:19.384
He had one once,

06:19.837 --> 06:23.741
which he bought from Warren Howell, which turned out to be stolen from here in Chicago.

06:24.122 --> 06:27.566
He bought it unknowingly, of course, and returned it when he knew.

06:28.287 --> 06:32.792
But what amazes me is that Howell actually sold it to him.

06:33.032 --> 06:37.697
Howell should have maybe researched it a little better on the provenance, but who's to know?

06:38.178 --> 06:39.319
I knew Warren Howell well.

06:39.379 --> 06:41.562
He was as honest as the days long.

06:41.582 --> 06:44.325
Oh yeah, no, nobody suggests that there was anything.

06:45.065 --> 06:50.280
The guy was a very clever con man.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.083
He came to him.

06:51.564 --> 06:55.395
Warren was calling me every day to share his problems with me.

06:55.797 --> 07:01.707
get my reassurance, want to make sure that I didn't think he was a crook, which I never would have thought in any circumstances.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.751
He was one of the outstanding citizens of San Francisco.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.054
That's true.

07:06.094 --> 07:13.626
We were at his funeral at the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, and there wasn't a dry eye and there wasn't a seat that was vacant.

07:13.706 --> 07:14.948
He was a tremendous man.

07:14.988 --> 07:17.873
It's too bad that had to happen to him.

07:18.353 --> 07:22.480
That stress must have accelerated his demise.

07:23.405 --> 07:28.511
But this guy comes in and tells his story, which made some sense.

07:29.853 --> 07:34.138
It had been, Meredith, have you met Nick Bassmanes?

07:34.158 --> 07:34.999
We met, we met.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.443
Okay.

07:38.463 --> 07:52.399
He comes up with this story that this is in a library in East Germany that belonged to his family and it had been smuggled out of East Germany

07:53.898 --> 08:01.487
Because the family needed the money, and Warren Howell was so certain about his legitimacy, he met him here at O'Hare.

08:01.967 --> 08:06.052
Warren was on his way to New York, and this guy was coming in from someplace else.

08:06.512 --> 08:07.353
They met at O'Hare.

08:08.555 --> 08:15.342
And he had a batch of these books, including the Harvey, in hand.

08:16.984 --> 08:21.930
And Warren looked at them and agreed to purchase them.

08:22.805 --> 08:38.661
And he had this thief deliver them to Ken Ebenzal, who was a trustee of the Queer Air Library, for Ken to have packed in his shop and to ship to Warren in San Francisco.

08:39.461 --> 08:47.449
Now, if he had thought that he was accepting stolen merchandise, would he have asked that these books be delivered to Ken Ebenzal?

08:47.529 --> 08:51.293
I mean, Ken didn't see anything.

08:51.948 --> 08:52.729
Who knows?

08:52.929 --> 08:53.350
Who knows?

08:53.410 --> 09:10.770
He was busy, involved, there were no marks of ownership that he could, you know, the things that happened in our office, people come and, you know, when I was president of the company at one time, I was so busy I didn't have time to go to the bathroom.

09:11.691 --> 09:18.158
And it's entirely possible that... But Haskell was the one who got that book.

09:19.302 --> 09:21.626
Haskell Norman was the person who bought that.

09:21.666 --> 09:23.849
And then he had to release it.

09:24.450 --> 09:29.218
The only one that has not been released is the one that Haven O'Moore bought.

09:29.398 --> 09:30.019
That's right.

09:30.039 --> 09:33.645
Which is the Harvey that I'm talking about, the first edition.

09:33.665 --> 09:39.935
And it's still, I guess, on the shelves of either Haven O'Moore or the guy who funded the collection, Davis.

09:39.955 --> 09:40.355
I don't think so.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.177
I think Haven keeps it.

09:41.197 --> 09:41.417
Davis.

09:41.898 --> 09:42.819
Maybe Davis kept it.

09:43.300 --> 09:43.681
Probably.

09:43.701 --> 09:44.902
He put the money up to begin with.

09:45.003 --> 09:47.166
Yeah, but...

09:48.496 --> 09:52.220
Owen Gingrich mentioned that very same thing the other day.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.982
He suspects that Havens has it.

09:54.282 --> 09:54.763
Probably.

09:55.644 --> 09:58.667
And eventually it'll end up back at the U.S.

09:58.687 --> 10:02.531
Yeah, the agreement was he gets to keep it, I guess, as long as he's alive.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.573
I guess that was the arrangement.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.557
I don't know why he wanted to keep it.

10:07.597 --> 10:08.638
He put up a big fight.

10:08.698 --> 10:10.660
I guess he figured he'd pay for it.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.521
Paid a big price.

10:13.483 --> 10:16.326
It was carefully researched by Warren Howell.

10:17.099 --> 10:19.122
It's a very rare book, as you know.

10:19.302 --> 10:24.369
That's the book that Gingrich is starting to work on now, in terms of trying to find every one that he can.

10:25.190 --> 10:33.060
It's an interesting scenario, not only to try and find every book, but to see what annotations might be in it.

10:33.080 --> 10:40.710
That's what makes the book especially interesting, particularly when a scholar is doing the kind of research that Gingrich is doing.

10:41.770 --> 10:44.313
So I'm going to include him in the next book.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.154
I love this room.

10:45.174 --> 10:46.415
This is a delightful room.

10:46.676 --> 10:48.198
Look, it's very comfortable.

10:48.238 --> 10:49.799
You've got personal things in here.

10:49.839 --> 10:52.022
It's not austere in any way.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.143
It's very comfortable.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.187
You sit here, right in here?

10:56.427 --> 10:58.950
I sit right there, exactly where you're sitting.

10:59.351 --> 11:00.772
And you absorb yourselves.

11:00.792 --> 11:09.162
Well, it's complete diversion, and it takes me into another dimension.

11:11.690 --> 11:14.313
How long have you lived out here?

11:14.333 --> 11:14.613
Where?

11:15.054 --> 11:16.776
Out here in Glencoe?

11:16.936 --> 11:18.498
I think 40 years, 41 years.

11:18.518 --> 11:19.038
40 years.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.864
We used to live in South Glencoe before we lived here.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.104
I see.

11:25.346 --> 11:27.868
Did you have a larger library once upon a time?

11:28.830 --> 11:31.473
Yeah, well, we had a two-story house, but this is much better.

11:31.493 --> 11:33.995
This is a ranch house.

11:34.016 --> 11:38.320
So you call this the study and that's the library?

11:38.340 --> 11:39.722
Then in my bedroom I have...

11:40.124 --> 11:43.788
reading copies of books and things like that.

11:43.928 --> 11:49.494
It's a small library, but it's something that means a lot to me personally.

11:49.735 --> 11:51.857
It didn't look small to me.

11:52.418 --> 11:58.724
I noticed also that you had the Pforzheimer catalog in there, which is a very, very scarce catalog.

11:59.465 --> 12:01.808
I bought it from Fleming.

12:01.828 --> 12:05.452
And, you know, if you're collecting English literature... You have to have that catalog.

12:05.472 --> 12:08.335
You've got to have that catalog, especially early English literature.

12:08.355 --> 12:10.097
And they've never reprinted it.

12:10.465 --> 12:11.346
It's a rare book.

12:11.366 --> 12:12.648
It is a very rare book.

12:12.668 --> 12:14.852
They were selling it for $25 a copy.

12:15.573 --> 12:18.257
Well, it's a lot more than that now, I can tell you.

12:18.397 --> 12:20.079
I mean, when it was issued.

12:20.340 --> 12:20.961
That's amazing.

12:20.981 --> 12:21.702
In 1940.

12:22.643 --> 12:27.891
It's now, but it ranges in price between $5,000 to $10,000.

12:28.151 --> 12:29.453
Yeah, Oknole had one.

12:29.473 --> 12:29.994
I saw it.

12:30.014 --> 12:32.197
$5,000 to $10,000.

12:32.217 --> 12:34.060
Yeah, it was too stiff for me.

12:35.022 --> 12:35.983
That looks like the...

12:36.200 --> 12:37.802
Estelle Doheny.

12:37.862 --> 12:38.803
Yes.

12:38.963 --> 12:40.184
And I see the Bradley Martin.

12:40.204 --> 12:41.246
Bradley Martin.

12:41.266 --> 12:42.146
And there's the garden.

12:42.227 --> 12:43.808
See, I know them just by the spines.

12:44.609 --> 12:46.131
And the Streeter catalog.

12:46.231 --> 12:49.194
I have Bradley Martin's Streeter catalog.

12:50.456 --> 12:52.137
I bought that at his sale.

12:52.538 --> 12:59.946
I was very pleased to get something out of that sale.

12:59.966 --> 13:00.567
Very nice.

13:00.687 --> 13:01.768
This is my junk room.

13:01.788 --> 13:05.532
I also, this table, and I'll let you look at it shortly, I...

13:06.170 --> 13:09.474
have hornbooks that are in this table.

13:09.534 --> 13:10.955
Let me just pull this aside.

13:11.696 --> 13:12.697
There never is enough room.

13:16.021 --> 13:16.641
Take a look at that.

13:17.142 --> 13:17.903
Come over here.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.304
Oh, you have them right there on the table.

13:19.484 --> 13:20.526
Yeah, they're in the table.

13:20.786 --> 13:21.226
Oh my goodness.

13:21.246 --> 13:21.747
All the way through.

13:21.767 --> 13:22.908
Let me hold this.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.070
Oh, there they are.

13:25.110 --> 13:25.891
Now that opens up.

13:28.134 --> 13:29.235
I don't think I can get it out.

13:29.255 --> 13:29.976
No, I see it.

13:30.136 --> 13:31.277
I've seen them.

13:32.518 --> 13:35.822
It opens up and there's a creche there.

13:35.920 --> 13:40.266
And there are two religious figures, nuns or monks, one on either side.

13:41.087 --> 13:44.532
Don't open the table.

13:44.552 --> 13:45.374
I've seen them before.

13:45.434 --> 13:47.977
Well, all of these are hornbooks.

13:49.419 --> 13:50.701
And you had the table designed?

13:51.262 --> 13:51.983
Yeah.

13:52.003 --> 13:52.824
No, I'm sorry.

13:52.904 --> 13:55.648
I bought the table from the man who sold me the hornbooks.

13:56.089 --> 13:56.430
I see.

13:57.111 --> 13:58.052
Who was a great collector.

13:58.092 --> 14:03.700
He has the Furtzheimer Shelley catalog as well, which is very important.

14:06.582 --> 14:07.043
Look at them.

14:07.503 --> 14:08.104
Walk around.

14:08.124 --> 14:09.646
Take a look at the books that are in this room.

14:09.686 --> 14:11.328
We will.

14:13.371 --> 14:15.674
I just feel so comfortable in here, I have to say.

14:15.755 --> 14:19.019
I've got Gibbons Library.

14:29.193 --> 14:32.137
Lovely.

14:32.157 --> 14:35.121
I love my books on books, too, I have to say.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.821
I think I have most of these.

14:38.982 --> 14:39.682
I'm sure you do.

14:41.704 --> 14:44.987
Look to your right there on the top shelf.

14:45.748 --> 14:47.829
I think you'll recognize there's an author there.

14:48.090 --> 14:48.750
Yeah, I see it.

14:50.872 --> 14:53.034
Later on, I'm going to ask you to inscribe it for me.

14:53.054 --> 14:57.518
I brought my fountain pen with me to do that, and it will be my pleasure.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.240
It will be my pleasure.

15:02.002 --> 15:02.883
It's a beautiful label.

15:03.643 --> 15:04.024
Thank you.

15:05.105 --> 15:05.445
Thank you.

15:05.628 --> 15:08.412
So now, are you re-learning Latin or learning Latin?

15:08.432 --> 15:08.773
Re-learning.

15:09.213 --> 15:09.714
Re-learning.

15:10.736 --> 15:12.859
And with the help of a couple of dictionaries.

15:14.802 --> 15:16.604
You can't read old, ancient Latin.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.788
It's different than modern Latin.

15:18.808 --> 15:20.670
But I get enough of the sense of something.

15:21.892 --> 15:33.289
And being able to pick up a book, whether it's the Decivitati Dei or Summa Theologica or any important book, and being able to refer to a paragraph or

15:33.927 --> 15:42.517
or two, which gives me the essence of what the man is trying to say, and being able to read it, the original, with help.

15:42.858 --> 15:43.358
With help.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.162
We all need help.

15:50.607 --> 15:55.353
Were you always planning to be a businessman?

15:55.393 --> 16:00.559
I mean, how is it that you became so fascinated by books and reading them in their original ways?

16:02.868 --> 16:13.658
When I was in the second grade, and this is a true story, when I was in the second grade I had a teacher whose name was O'Brien.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.741
And she's as vivid to me now as you are.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.226
She must have been in her middle thirties at the time.

16:22.247 --> 16:32.757
She had black hair streaked with gray, she's just as, just so much alive, so vivid, and huge blue eyes, big as saucers.

16:33.918 --> 16:36.321
And she really was a frustrated actress.

16:38.543 --> 16:39.605
And she would read to us.

16:41.607 --> 16:42.428
This was second grade.

16:42.468 --> 16:43.389
We were seven years old.

16:45.091 --> 16:49.076
One of the books she read to us was Christopher Morley's Parnassus on Wheels.

16:49.296 --> 16:49.937
Which I have.

16:50.558 --> 16:51.298
You must have it.

16:51.358 --> 16:51.619
I do.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.481
I have it first edition.

16:53.501 --> 16:55.744
And she made the book come alive.

16:55.784 --> 16:56.765
She just didn't read it.

16:57.946 --> 16:58.707
She acted it.

16:59.007 --> 17:00.049
Like the Broadway stage.

17:00.689 --> 17:02.592
Now there must have been 40 kids in the class.

17:02.832 --> 17:03.773
I don't know who else

17:04.293 --> 17:09.218
was as affected as was I, but I had an epiphany.

17:11.120 --> 17:15.004
It was something that just, I think you have to be predisposed.

17:15.985 --> 17:18.868
I think it has to be, the ground has to be fertile to begin with.

17:18.888 --> 17:21.130
It has to be ready to receive the seedlings.

17:21.270 --> 17:21.811
I think so.

17:21.911 --> 17:22.411
Or seeds.

17:23.433 --> 17:28.798
I don't know whether any of the others, I doubt whether any of the other kids, they probably forgot before they walked out of the classroom.

17:29.909 --> 17:35.295
But that impacted me in a way that I remember today, a hundred years after the fact.

17:36.637 --> 17:38.279
And that was the beginning of my downfall.

17:39.780 --> 17:41.683
And I began to read.

17:41.743 --> 17:42.924
Of course, I was a reader.

17:43.064 --> 17:44.246
I was always a reader.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.249
I read everything.

17:47.269 --> 17:47.609
Everything.

17:47.689 --> 17:53.636
Encyclopedia, almanacs, boys' books, you name it.

17:55.278 --> 17:59.443
All of the things that...

18:00.233 --> 18:01.154
The kids read.

18:01.755 --> 18:07.921
And I'd read sometimes a dozen books, a dozen books a week, literally.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.305
This is just an aside.

18:12.806 --> 18:15.569
I'd go into the bathroom, and I'd read.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.913
My mother was afraid I'd get hemorrhoids.

18:19.933 --> 18:24.158
So she'd knock on the door, and she'd always threatened to tear up the book.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.460
So I...

18:26.744 --> 18:56.751
would secrete it in the beginning I secreted it under my shirt put my shirt over my trousers as a young kid it wasn't long before she found my hiding place she never taught the book of course it went on and she'd knock on the door I'm telling your son this time I really mean it and we had a humongous laundry basket in the bathroom so I secreted the book I was reading among the dirty laundry

18:57.406 --> 18:59.529
and then would retrieve it later on.

19:00.611 --> 19:01.211
She found that.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.034
Did not tear up the book.

19:03.334 --> 19:03.875
Just threatened.

19:04.997 --> 19:06.879
She was afraid I was going to comply in reading so much.

19:08.782 --> 19:12.948
One day she was pounding on the door and she says, Son, this time I mean it.

19:13.188 --> 19:16.173
I have said this a hundred times, but this time I mean it.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.095
I'm going to tear the book up.

19:19.097 --> 19:21.220
I told you I don't want you reading in the bathroom.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.383
You have plenty of time to read during the day.

19:25.366 --> 19:25.506
I said,

19:25.891 --> 19:28.495
I felt that this time she did mean it.

19:28.515 --> 19:28.955
What to do?

19:33.281 --> 19:38.469
She knew my hiding places on my person, and she knew about the laundry basket.

19:38.489 --> 19:41.152
There was no other place to hide it in the bathroom.

19:41.172 --> 19:47.621
Suddenly, out of flash of inspiration, we had an opaque window, as you would normally do in all bathrooms.

19:48.102 --> 19:52.388
So I raised the opaque window, put it out on the outer ledge, and closed the window.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.494
My mother searched me.

19:56.055 --> 19:58.297
She did search you, huh?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.880
Searched the laundry basket, could not find it.

20:00.900 --> 20:01.921
There was nothing to be found.

20:03.323 --> 20:12.092
I went to sleep with the idea that as soon as mother and dad had fallen asleep, I'd go back to the bathroom, retrieve the book, and that would be it.

20:13.014 --> 20:16.057
But I was young, and I was tired, and I fell asleep.

20:18.079 --> 20:21.142
I got up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and I was frantic.

20:21.223 --> 20:24.366
I was just beside myself, and I ran immediately to the bathroom.

20:25.072 --> 20:28.497
And it stepped into the bathtub because the window was on the other side of the bathtub.

20:28.897 --> 20:30.380
Raised the window.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.401
And I was heartbroken.

20:32.222 --> 20:34.986
It had snowed during the night.

20:35.006 --> 20:37.530
And the book was wet and warped.

20:38.231 --> 20:39.733
I had it until a few years ago.

20:41.295 --> 20:42.437
I was just beside myself.

20:42.998 --> 20:44.019
Because I was a nut.

20:44.860 --> 20:52.952
When I would get a book, even if I'd get it from the library, but particularly if I was gifted with a book, I would immediately prepare...

20:53.590 --> 20:54.651
a dust jacket for it.

20:54.751 --> 20:57.074
My mother would send out her laundry of flat work.

20:57.114 --> 20:59.117
They didn't have laundry machines like they do now.

20:59.137 --> 21:02.060
You either have to do it by hand or you send it out to the laundry.

21:03.102 --> 21:12.754
And when it came back, the pillowcases and sheets and things like that, and towels, when they came back, they were usually wrapped in heavy brown paper.

21:13.655 --> 21:14.976
That brown paper was mine.

21:15.057 --> 21:16.238
I had dibs on it.

21:17.239 --> 21:22.686
I would cut it up and I'd make it into a dust jacket so that I would not soil

21:23.189 --> 21:52.825
the covers of the book or dampen in any way or hurt the legend on the spine so I was a real fuss budget but if that didn't help my book which was Tarzan of the Apes that I had spent a quarter for from Jerry Nedwick it didn't help my book it was soaked solid still during the night but I was always a nut about these about books and I read omnivorously there wasn't

21:53.311 --> 21:53.952
Just everything.

21:54.873 --> 21:55.995
And I'm the love of Shakespeare.

21:56.015 --> 22:03.285
It was also induced by a teacher whose name was Elizabeth Waters.

22:03.405 --> 22:11.456
Elizabeth K. Waters, God rest her soul in peace, who was my sophomore teacher in high school.

22:11.476 --> 22:14.000
And she had a habit when she wanted to give you an assignment.

22:15.702 --> 22:19.768
She'd say, Prince of Chicago, Nick, I want you to do so and so.

22:19.788 --> 22:22.812
She'd start always, Prince of Chicago, let's take the curse off of it.

22:23.213 --> 22:28.339
By calling you the Prince of Chicago, you felt good, and then you felt bad when she gave you the assignment.

22:28.379 --> 22:29.481
But that's how she would start.

22:29.881 --> 22:33.285
Or if it was a girl, she would call her Miss Chicago.

22:35.248 --> 22:37.711
That was the way she did.

22:38.071 --> 22:41.836
One day she says, Prince of Chicago, you're going to do King Lear for me.

22:42.356 --> 22:47.703
You're going to report on it to class, and you're going to write a report, and you're going to submit the report before you write.

22:49.125 --> 22:51.988
That's a tough play, as you know.

22:53.757 --> 22:59.723
I spent I don't know how many hours in the library and reading and trying to get some handle on it.

23:01.785 --> 23:05.448
For one thing, reading Shakespeare is not easy to begin with.

23:05.468 --> 23:11.714
And reading and understanding King Lear is, for a 15-year-old kid, is a very tough job.

23:11.774 --> 23:12.875
It was for me anyway.

23:12.955 --> 23:18.701
I was not that smart that I could read it and immediately know what he was trying to say.

23:18.881 --> 23:23.005
But I worked my duff off in order to write the report.

23:23.879 --> 23:25.882
and then to give the oral in the class.

23:27.344 --> 23:51.135
And just as Miss O'Brien triggered my love of books by reading to us from Parnassus on Wheels, just in the same manner and measure, Miss Waters, who assigned King Lear to me, opened up this wellspring of love that I

23:51.335 --> 23:54.800
I've never been able to satiate for Mr. Shakespeare.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.266
But that's how I got involved in Shakespeare.

23:59.327 --> 24:00.209
From a very early age?

24:00.229 --> 24:02.833
So it wasn't anything in school or anything like that?

24:02.853 --> 24:03.474
Well, there was.

24:03.674 --> 24:07.700
But I mean in terms of like formal study of English literature and college or something.

24:07.720 --> 24:17.275
Later on I read and took courses like everyone else, including great books when I became a young man and that kind of thing.

24:19.027 --> 24:20.729
That was my opening, my introduction.

24:20.929 --> 24:21.911
And I really sweated.

24:22.712 --> 24:28.879
And I didn't think I'd ever like it because it was so difficult for me at the age of 15 to understand King Lear.

24:29.981 --> 24:33.085
So you've really been involved in books all your life ever since you've been born?

24:33.325 --> 24:33.826
All my life.

24:34.346 --> 24:34.807
Love books.

24:35.367 --> 24:36.389
I really have worked.

24:37.650 --> 24:44.078
I was trained in the law, which is a discipline, and admitted to the bar, but never practiced.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.042
I practiced two years before I went into the real estate business.

24:47.427 --> 24:49.790
I've really worked so I could afford my habit.

24:49.970 --> 24:52.653
You know, just like some people have a habit.

24:53.134 --> 24:54.075
That was my habit.

24:54.135 --> 24:56.838
Some I have it for drugs, some for women, some for gambling.

24:57.359 --> 24:59.241
My habit has been Bibliomania.

24:59.701 --> 25:01.964
At what point did you start indulging it, would you say?

25:02.004 --> 25:04.147
I mean, as soon as you could afford it, you did?

25:06.069 --> 25:07.350
I'd buy an occasional book.

25:07.411 --> 25:09.733
I remember once on a trip to New York with my wife.

25:11.295 --> 25:13.898
I went to Brentano's at the time.

25:13.918 --> 25:15.460
I didn't know anything about conditions.

25:16.604 --> 25:22.771
And I bought a Boswell at Brentano's in a modern binding that had been washed.

25:22.791 --> 25:25.073
I mean, the book had been washed.

25:25.093 --> 25:25.874
Boswell's Johnson.

25:27.255 --> 25:28.136
Oh, I treasured it.

25:28.156 --> 25:29.798
Which is a pretty nice book, actually.

25:29.818 --> 25:30.018
Yeah.

25:30.899 --> 25:32.761
And I didn't pay very much for it at the time.

25:32.781 --> 25:33.863
Then I upgraded it.

25:34.784 --> 25:43.573
The next one I got was in a contemporary binding from a very excellent library with good provenance.

25:44.296 --> 25:47.480
The third copy that I have now on my shelves is in boards.

25:49.182 --> 25:56.351
And my regret is that I didn't always tend to upgrade these things because there was something tempting me all the time.

25:57.072 --> 26:08.166
So if you don't get the right book at the beginning, you often tend to keep it because you get involved, you want something else.

26:08.246 --> 26:10.168
You tend to keep what?

26:10.269 --> 26:12.231
Your first copy, more often than not.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.813
Sometimes, you know.

26:16.291 --> 26:23.379
Have you had any kind of a sentimental attachment to certain books that you've kept even though you've upgraded them?

26:23.419 --> 26:25.942
When you get a book, you upgrade.

26:26.583 --> 26:30.607
When you get the same book, you'll dispose of the earlier ones.

26:33.330 --> 26:34.191
I'm sure I have.

26:34.332 --> 26:35.733
I can't think of one at the moment.

26:36.534 --> 26:45.184
But I'm sure that there are books that I have to which I'm sentimentally attached, and even when I could afford to get a better copy, did not.

26:47.257 --> 26:50.180
Now I notice, as we mentioned earlier, you have the Streeter collection.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.622
You have the Doheny, the Martin, the Garden.

26:54.343 --> 26:58.267
Do you kind of quietly measure yourself against these other collectors?

26:58.347 --> 27:01.389
No, these are princes of color.

27:01.730 --> 27:03.191
These are collector princes.

27:03.611 --> 27:04.052
I'm not.

27:05.413 --> 27:05.793
I'm not.

27:05.813 --> 27:07.034
I'm no Bradley Martin.

27:07.154 --> 27:09.597
I'm no Garden Limited.

27:09.757 --> 27:11.338
I'm no Mrs. Doheny.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.020
Just me.

27:15.282 --> 27:16.943
But you do have some splendid things.

27:17.362 --> 27:18.363
I have some nice things.

27:18.583 --> 27:22.186
You were saying that of the first folio, there were only six now in private hands?

27:22.206 --> 27:22.767
Is that right?

27:22.927 --> 27:45.968
According to Anthony James West, who had recently completed the provisional census, and I will send you a copy of it, by the way, he was able to find only six copies of the first folio in the United States in private hands, of which three that I have checked against Sidney Lee

27:46.555 --> 27:47.256
are fragments.

27:49.057 --> 27:51.380
Three are complete and without facsimile.

27:53.962 --> 27:58.026
One of the three, complete and without facsimile, is mine.

27:59.147 --> 28:02.930
The other is Mr. Scheide's, whose books are on deposit at Princeton.

28:03.631 --> 28:08.455
And the third is the Manny copy, which is now Stuart Rose.

28:09.176 --> 28:10.477
His is a rebound copy.

28:10.537 --> 28:11.638
Mine is an old binding.

28:11.658 --> 28:15.482
His is a modern binding.

28:16.171 --> 28:22.377
To the best of his knowledge and research, he was able to find only six in the United States.

28:22.898 --> 28:24.199
That's not many, is it?

28:24.219 --> 28:31.386
And interestingly enough, there are only six in Britain, of which only three in Britain are complete.

28:31.406 --> 28:32.507
There are only six copies?

28:32.707 --> 28:33.528
In private hands.

28:33.788 --> 28:34.569
Oh, in private hands.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.890
There are only six in Britain.

28:36.291 --> 28:44.018
And again, there almost miraculously, three are complete and three are fragments.

28:45.297 --> 28:47.239
I looked up the ones that are complete.

28:47.319 --> 28:48.621
Are they facsimile?

28:48.661 --> 28:51.204
The ones that have fragments, do they have facsimile?

28:51.224 --> 28:52.145
Sometimes they do.

28:53.187 --> 28:54.648
And are most of the bindings different?

28:54.688 --> 28:55.249
They must be.

28:55.630 --> 28:55.930
Yes.

28:57.432 --> 29:00.836
And you say your binding is essentially a contemporary binding?

29:00.896 --> 29:07.604
You know, he says, Frank Brewer, Bremus, who assembled this great collector, calls them original.

29:07.784 --> 29:10.007
I think that it's an old binding.

29:10.768 --> 29:14.933
That's probably, my guess would be, if I were making an educated guess,

29:15.655 --> 29:20.042
It could be late 17th century.

29:21.705 --> 29:24.589
Have you ever seen the folios at the Folger Library?

29:24.649 --> 29:27.814
No, I was at the Folger, but I've never seen the books there.

29:27.834 --> 29:28.916
It's amazing.

29:28.956 --> 29:33.423
They took me in there, just stacked like so many bars of bouillon.

29:33.443 --> 29:34.665
They've got 90 copies there.

29:34.865 --> 29:36.428
I don't think it's that many.

29:36.488 --> 29:36.808
90?

29:37.029 --> 29:37.469
Is it 90?

29:37.530 --> 29:39.833
Well, most of them are.

29:39.873 --> 29:42.878
There are a handful that are complete and without facsimile, though.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.810
Most of them are fragments or partials of one kind.

29:45.830 --> 29:49.474
It's fully one-third, I think, of every single copy, I think.

29:49.634 --> 29:52.116
Yes, of the surviving copies.

29:52.136 --> 29:52.256
Right.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.041
Well, very nice.

29:57.942 --> 30:02.166
What is that catalog here?

30:02.186 --> 30:03.207
Oh, that's the Ashley.

30:03.267 --> 30:04.108
Yeah.

30:05.569 --> 30:06.209
Wise.

30:06.370 --> 30:09.533
That is some other major catalogs.

30:09.553 --> 30:10.233
Yeah, that's tough.

30:10.273 --> 30:12.055
I've been looking for that catalog myself.

30:12.608 --> 30:18.014
You've got all the great ones here.

30:20.477 --> 30:21.739
Actually, I saw it in New York.

30:21.759 --> 30:23.481
I should have bought it when I saw it.

30:23.501 --> 30:25.043
What, the Mars Catalog?

30:25.243 --> 30:25.383
Yeah.

30:25.403 --> 30:26.564
It's an excellent catalog.

30:26.584 --> 30:27.546
It's a wonderful catalog.

30:27.566 --> 30:30.008
The Church Catalog is also a very great catalog.

30:30.029 --> 30:30.529
That's correct.

30:30.669 --> 30:31.570
I have that there.

30:32.251 --> 30:34.494
The Church Catalog is a very fine catalog.

30:35.235 --> 30:36.516
I know that catalog.

30:36.536 --> 30:38.238
The Streeter, of course, is marvelous.

30:38.338 --> 30:41.502
For Americana, there's none better.

30:41.735 --> 30:43.056
I have a whole catalog.

30:43.837 --> 30:44.938
I have a whole catalog here.

30:45.138 --> 30:46.460
And I have a Jerome Kern.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.741
I have a Jerome Kern here.

30:47.761 --> 30:48.642
Do you have a Brinley?

30:49.743 --> 30:50.824
No, I do not have a Brinley.

30:50.844 --> 30:51.605
I have a Brinley.

30:51.625 --> 30:52.566
I do not have a Brinley.

30:53.147 --> 30:53.947
And that's a nice one.

30:53.967 --> 30:55.509
That's a tough one to get.

30:55.529 --> 30:56.570
I have a George Daniel.

30:57.131 --> 30:57.871
That's very good.

30:58.072 --> 31:01.415
I collect, this is one of my major collections is book catalogs.

31:01.435 --> 31:03.237
Book catalogs.

31:04.778 --> 31:06.400
And auction catalogs.

31:06.420 --> 31:11.185
Well, auction catalogs, I couldn't possibly collect.

31:11.840 --> 31:19.504
The ones I started getting, I started collecting catalogs, or not collecting, receiving catalogs, in 1965.
