00:03.001 --> 00:05.705
We're talking to Curt Monaghan.

00:06.586 --> 00:07.347
Congratulations.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.190
Is this really your last book?

00:09.430 --> 00:12.073
Yeah, I think so, Curt.

00:12.374 --> 00:13.896
I mean, are you tired of writing?

00:14.136 --> 00:18.522
Well, I've said I'm completely put.

00:18.602 --> 00:27.134
You know, if my books had all disappeared and never been read and everything, I'd still be waving my hand and saying, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:27.154 --> 00:32.822
My publishing history has been most enjoyable.

00:33.511 --> 00:38.699
I continue to say everything I ever wanted to say.

00:38.719 --> 00:54.002
And, for sure, this is, you know, if I could be, I've been straining all my life to communicate something, but I can communicate it all, you know, the messages I've got through.

00:55.425 --> 01:02.235
Do you think this has something to do with the difficulty you have with this novel, or is it... Well, what a...

01:03.312 --> 01:13.707
It took me a while to figure out what it should be, which was the last chapter in one big book, rather than a freestanding piece of work.

01:13.727 --> 01:15.470
But also, I didn't like the story.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.074
It wasn't my kind of story.

01:18.094 --> 01:19.476
I wasn't that interested.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.018
So why not chuck it?

01:21.038 --> 01:21.338
I did.

01:21.799 --> 01:25.004
But, I mean, it took you ten years, though, to chuck it.

01:25.024 --> 01:28.509
Wasn't there a point along the way when you said, this isn't working?

01:28.569 --> 01:30.692
Of course it did.

01:30.712 --> 01:32.695
No, it was acceptable.

01:33.113 --> 01:37.018
It was finished, and it was in the catalog.

01:37.038 --> 01:38.521
It was in the Putnam catalog.

01:38.541 --> 01:38.681
Really?

01:38.821 --> 01:39.402
I didn't know that.

01:39.642 --> 01:41.144
And I said, I don't like it.

01:43.387 --> 01:47.533
So I started all over again and made it.

01:48.014 --> 01:48.615
I love this.

01:48.635 --> 01:50.057
Well, it's a nice coda.

01:50.317 --> 01:51.779
Now, what the hell?

01:51.799 --> 01:58.328
It's how many authors lived to be 75 and get to look back at everything they did, you know?

01:58.797 --> 02:06.246
Looking back at it now, where it is a body of work that's discreet, I mean, it's now, it has boundaries.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.230
Do you see it as a corpus?

02:09.250 --> 02:12.234
Do you see this body of work as a definable corpus?

02:12.254 --> 02:14.917
Yes, I see it as organic with my life.

02:15.999 --> 02:27.994
It could have been quite separate, you know, as I could have, well, I could have written a bunch of detective stories or whatever, which would have been little gems, you know, but quite separate from that.

02:28.430 --> 02:32.695
turns out, in retrospect, to be quite personal.

02:32.715 --> 02:40.585
Do you think that it's necessary to, if then, I mean, I know it sounds like a dumb question, but to truly understand you that we do have to read the body of work?

02:41.686 --> 02:41.867
Yes.

02:42.247 --> 02:47.434
If this book will make no sense to people, then I've read at least one other book of mine.

02:47.454 --> 02:49.736
And perhaps even all of them.

02:49.797 --> 02:56.665
You know, the mail I get, the first line is, often is, I've read everything you've ever read.

02:57.353 --> 02:58.995
Is that the most satisfying thing?

02:59.035 --> 03:01.599
Oh, it's very nice to hear.

03:01.619 --> 03:03.682
I mean, it's an accident.

03:03.962 --> 03:06.065
You can't create that.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.907
You can't make it happen.

03:08.068 --> 03:10.030
I was out in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.

03:10.171 --> 03:14.496
I'm working at a new book, and I had a interview with Chili Olson, who was quite an interesting woman.

03:15.558 --> 03:19.563
And she knew I was coming, so she got my book from the library.

03:20.625 --> 03:24.390
And I was so pleased to open it up, and there's the card.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.366
to see that that copy has been checked out 32 times.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.569
I took a photograph of it.

03:31.589 --> 03:32.690
Yeah, of course you did.

03:32.710 --> 03:35.233
That means more to me than 32 sales, I think.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.094
Well, it's with a book.

03:37.355 --> 03:39.997
I mean, with a movie, you know, exactly how many people saw it.

03:40.638 --> 03:44.281
But with a book, you have no idea how many people have read it.

03:44.301 --> 03:46.363
It's indestructible, too.

03:46.504 --> 03:50.567
It's Twitter, but... One time over there.

03:50.628 --> 03:53.230
Down the Virgin Islands, the American Virgin Islands, I guess.

03:55.285 --> 03:58.429
And papers were blown by, pages out of the book.

04:00.753 --> 04:07.522
And I started chasing it, and it all piled up against the shrubs.

04:07.542 --> 04:12.609
And it was a memoir by AndrÃ© Gide that I'd never read before.

04:12.629 --> 04:15.353
In Christ, I was able to gather up.

04:15.620 --> 04:19.884
this book and publish it myself there on the beach.

04:20.785 --> 04:22.326
Did you start reading it?

04:22.506 --> 04:23.327
Oh, yeah.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.709
I mean, I had to read it.

04:24.729 --> 04:26.690
I would find out what it was.

04:26.971 --> 04:30.634
The whole thing wasn't there, but what I did read was quite interesting.

04:30.714 --> 04:32.256
And it was fun chasing the pages.

04:32.916 --> 04:34.017
I might use that, you know.

04:34.077 --> 04:44.327
I'm writing a new book on this whole concept of book culture, and the eve of the new millennium, and where libraries are going, books, not only as objects, but

04:44.864 --> 04:47.867
Do you despair about the future of literature?

04:47.887 --> 04:49.909
Do you share with how it goes?

04:49.929 --> 04:50.630
Well, no.

04:50.730 --> 04:53.612
Styron's been quite sane on the subject.

04:53.633 --> 04:56.515
You know, other people have good ideas, too.

04:56.535 --> 05:07.446
And he said that, you know, the great Russian novels were written for a very small audience because, you know, this was a barbarous nation.

05:07.466 --> 05:11.690
You know, a high degree of illiteracy and all that.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.753
And that was enough.

05:15.357 --> 05:25.134
So, actually, you know, we're all money-crazy and fame-crazy now, and have to go nationwide and all that.

05:25.354 --> 05:28.680
And, you know, there's a small audience.

05:29.922 --> 05:34.630
There's an audience, and ought to be respected as such, and enjoy this such.

05:34.651 --> 05:39.559
Philip Roth has said, not to me, but just quoted by Harold Bloom, who I interviewed for this new book.

05:40.248 --> 05:45.835
that he believes that there were only perhaps 50,000 serious readers in the United States and about the world.

05:48.758 --> 05:54.084
I'm not asking you to comment on that number, but I think you're basically saying something.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.548
There really aren't that many people who read seriously.

05:57.568 --> 06:04.897
Well, what I've said is that, you know, the Jeffersonian dream of a literate electorate is crazy.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.883
It's like expecting everybody to play the French one.

06:10.015 --> 06:14.760
Because it's hard to do, to read.

06:16.001 --> 06:21.586
And so, well, what Slaughterhouse-Five was taught in high school is very common.

06:22.447 --> 06:25.951
And, you know, these kids are having trouble already.

06:26.771 --> 06:28.493
And then the story isn't sequential.

06:30.415 --> 06:32.337
You know, it was all of a sudden 20 years ago.

06:32.357 --> 06:35.740
It was, hey, come on, give me a break, you know, paying attention to it.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.503
Or irony, where you say one thing and mean another.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.723
Oh, come on.

06:43.826 --> 06:50.234
You know, you say straight out in this book that Kilburg is your alter ego.

06:50.254 --> 06:54.759
Explain to me what an alter ego is to you.

06:55.440 --> 07:01.227
Well, in this case, he is a science fiction writer.

07:01.388 --> 07:02.108
I might have been.

07:04.632 --> 07:08.997
Because some people get hooked on that, you know, and they're really pretty good writers.

07:09.719 --> 07:19.036
from time to time, Ted Sturgeon and, well, Isaac Asimov, a genius.

07:19.056 --> 07:23.223
You know, a book I'm reading right now, which I've never read before, is called A Canticle Filippowitz.

07:23.283 --> 07:24.365
Yes.

07:24.565 --> 07:26.168
It's just brought in a new paperback.

07:26.188 --> 07:26.349
Yeah.

07:26.729 --> 07:27.531
It's magnificent.

07:28.472 --> 07:31.137
Who's the author?

07:31.420 --> 07:33.542
Well, it's a guy well-known for science fiction.

07:33.642 --> 07:36.985
Yeah, he's only written that one book and another book, well, that appears to be posthumous.

07:37.045 --> 07:41.189
It doesn't say it, but it says the state of... Yeah, I remember it.

07:41.209 --> 07:42.831
I remember it kind of go for you.

07:42.931 --> 07:43.551
Yeah.

07:43.571 --> 07:53.321
Well, there are those marvelous one-shots, and I had... I taught an Iowa writer's workshop for two years, 65 and 66.

07:53.541 --> 07:58.726
I'll place this story in Des Moines, by the way, if you thought along right now.

07:58.746 --> 07:58.826
Oh.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.027
All right, but I...

08:00.344 --> 08:04.369
Well, among my students was John Irving, who's done it reasonably well since.

08:04.469 --> 08:04.709
Okay.

08:04.729 --> 08:08.334
And Keir Godwin and John Casey, who won National Book Award.

08:09.335 --> 08:12.819
And Andres de Buys, local boy.

08:13.540 --> 08:18.226
Local man.

08:18.246 --> 08:20.248
These people were all maturing to them.

08:20.268 --> 08:24.073
They had non-fets, draft dodgers, all kinds of people during the 60s.

08:24.509 --> 08:36.724
And they'd had love affairs and had their hearts broken in one thing or another, and I'd had kids, some of them, and all that, so they really had a lot to write about, and an interesting bunch.

08:37.926 --> 08:53.385
But I had them, at one point, go to the Iowa City Public Library and find novels that hadn't been taken out for years, and see whether they're any good or not.

08:54.158 --> 09:04.211
I'm writing about that.

09:04.331 --> 09:14.985
I start my new book with a prologue where I go to the Boston Athenaeum, and I'm looking for a book that was published in 1911, the catalog with Samuel Pepys's library, which I needed.

09:15.025 --> 09:20.632
And I get it, and as I'm checking it out, I'm the first person to take it out in 84 years.

09:20.993 --> 09:21.453
You can tell.

09:21.493 --> 09:22.815
And I say,

09:23.234 --> 09:27.758
something really stupid, like, gee, who did they buy this book for anyway?

09:27.778 --> 09:30.461
And the man says, he says, who bought it for you, sir?

09:31.502 --> 09:36.307
And he is amusing, and it's beautiful.

09:36.407 --> 09:41.552
But that's very interesting, you see, books, even if they aren't read, does that mean that they're not relevant anyway?

09:41.572 --> 09:51.722
Well, yes, I had a, since my education was technical, and my academic education was technical, that there are, you know, first chemistry and then anthropology, which

09:52.006 --> 10:00.257
Because I was dependent on my liberal arts friends to work to read.

10:02.320 --> 10:11.332
And here I am, as I'll soon be 75, and had my block knocked off by a book I had never thought of.

10:11.552 --> 10:15.237
Maybe I've heard about it and not given a damn, just a month ago.

10:16.058 --> 10:18.081
And a friend said, you know, I just read your book.

10:18.281 --> 10:21.085
He's got an advanced copy of this.

10:21.588 --> 10:27.638
He said, you are a clone of Erasmus of Rotterdam.

10:30.702 --> 10:30.783
Wow.

10:30.803 --> 10:36.091
And so he loaned me his copy of, uh, In Prose of Fallen.

10:36.872 --> 10:38.435
Jesus Christ, he was wrote.

10:38.855 --> 10:44.144
And I had, you know, Erasmus of Rotterdam had some PhD in, you know, this kind of thing.

10:44.224 --> 10:45.987
The world's first professional writer.

10:46.007 --> 10:46.508
Did you know that?

10:46.528 --> 10:46.768
No.

10:47.035 --> 10:48.778
He made money?

10:48.798 --> 10:49.579
Yeah.

10:49.599 --> 10:51.222
He did it mindfully to make money.

10:51.242 --> 10:51.463
Yeah.

10:51.583 --> 11:05.247
But he was very interesting, because he was a translator of different words of the Bible and all that, and a great biblical scholar.

11:06.990 --> 11:09.955
And he didn't dare.

11:14.643 --> 11:22.350
You can't detect that he's a skeptic about Christianity and about Holy Scripture.

11:23.031 --> 11:36.484
But one thing he does do as a scholar, and with his service I certainly welcome, was saying that the Trinity is a fraud.

11:36.644 --> 11:42.329
Because there's no justification for whatsoever in Scripture.

11:42.349 --> 11:43.030
And, of course, it was.

11:43.212 --> 11:50.005
interpolated, uh, many years later by, uh, I took balls.

11:50.306 --> 12:01.407
But then I read, and I'm a skeptic, of course, a racist and atheist, and by good people who are atheists, but I, uh, was reading in, uh,

12:08.609 --> 12:11.453
I've been talking too much and thinking too much.

12:11.513 --> 12:14.718
Who are the couple who did the wonderful historical series?

12:15.579 --> 12:16.440
Ken Bernstein?

12:16.941 --> 12:17.201
No.

12:17.482 --> 12:18.844
No, this is a book.

12:18.884 --> 12:20.406
Will Durant and Ariel Durant.

12:20.426 --> 12:29.940
Will and Ariel Durant in their book on the Middle Ages.

12:29.960 --> 12:35.848
They were outspoken skeptics, but they were upper class.

12:36.605 --> 12:38.067
Very scraped, isn't it?

12:38.088 --> 12:38.188
Yeah.

12:38.228 --> 12:43.998
But their families protected them from any sort of punishment where other people were getting burned at the stake.

12:44.018 --> 12:47.363
Galileo had to apologize for something.

12:47.784 --> 12:47.904
Yeah.

12:47.924 --> 12:50.489
He said, but it still does move around.

12:50.509 --> 12:51.811
It still does move around.

12:52.412 --> 12:58.883
Well, don't show me the torture instrument and I apologize for anything.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.073
Copernicus, you know, that great book.

13:02.093 --> 13:12.904
There was a fellow over here at Harvard by the name of Owen Gingrich, who has actually got out and found every surviving first and second edition copy of Copernicus in the world, writing about it.

13:12.924 --> 13:16.627
Because he had heard someplace that this was the greatest book never read.

13:17.849 --> 13:20.471
But he was going to see if there were annotations.

13:20.892 --> 13:22.593
And he's found enormous annotations.

13:22.653 --> 13:23.514
So that's formed.

13:23.554 --> 13:27.418
People did read Copernicus and did respond to it again.

13:27.736 --> 13:30.580
I wonder how intelligent the responses were.

13:31.121 --> 13:32.123
Well, it changed the world.

13:32.143 --> 13:36.129
I don't think he's evaluating it.

13:36.370 --> 13:36.951
He might be.

13:36.971 --> 13:40.736
He's still working on bibliography, but he wrote a book called The Great Copernicus Chase.

13:41.578 --> 13:46.385
Tell me, are you an author who believes that completed work is completed work?

13:46.826 --> 13:53.777
You know, like Henry James, when he went to write the prefaces to his novels, he wound up going in and fooling around with the novels and changing them.

13:53.943 --> 13:57.307
Is there anything with your body of work that you go back and tinker with?

13:57.548 --> 14:01.693
Well, there are mistakes.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.897
I mean, just technical mistakes.

14:04.917 --> 14:08.242
Beyond that, but more substantive things.

14:10.284 --> 14:18.355
When I teach, I haven't done it for a while, but I taught over here one year and again at Iowa and at City College.

14:19.696 --> 14:20.237
I said,

14:22.664 --> 14:31.433
that whatever you write in a short story or a novel or a play has to be like an egg.

14:32.715 --> 14:35.578
It's absolutely everything necessary to life.

14:36.819 --> 14:37.880
It's inside that shell.

14:39.662 --> 14:43.967
And to have a wholeness in that.

14:43.987 --> 14:52.536
And then this last book, I realized that the shell includes the whole of my last work, not such as this.

14:53.748 --> 14:59.897
You mentioned that Trump is your alter ego, and you talk about cynicism.

15:01.139 --> 15:08.010
And Mark Twain, as well, who didn't live to see World War I, but who said, screw it anyway.

15:09.172 --> 15:22.472
Do you feel this way, or is this your... Well, I think, what I'm talking about is, I think, people don't like life very much, and we have reason not to like it.

15:22.925 --> 15:30.434
humanity very much, and we seem to be a part of it because there are extraordinary events like the Holocaust.

15:33.538 --> 15:44.211
You know, and I've said two, I haven't ever written it, but maybe I have, about Dr. Strangelove.

15:45.613 --> 15:50.299
So what people particularly liked, I mean, nobody commented on it,

15:51.207 --> 15:57.876
because we're all going to live together, live together.

15:57.896 --> 16:05.486
And, you know, I think it was a doomsday device, but a beautiful cloud.

16:05.526 --> 16:10.132
Sort of like a quick cream on a marshmallow sundae or something.

16:10.332 --> 16:16.260
We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know where.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.822
That's a brilliant movie.

16:21.160 --> 16:21.681
I don't know.

16:21.701 --> 16:22.762
There's an awful lot.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.644
I don't know.

16:24.664 --> 16:27.227
I hated this Marv Albert thing so much.

16:27.307 --> 16:28.788
Isn't that terrible?

16:28.969 --> 16:30.610
That this can be done to a person?

16:33.173 --> 16:34.335
I have no idea.

16:35.276 --> 16:36.357
Why didn't he pay her off?

16:36.377 --> 16:39.000
That's what I'd like to know, if you don't say.

16:39.020 --> 16:46.188
Well, but... Apparently, he did do something there, which should be ashamed, but... It's not the public's right to know about it.

16:46.368 --> 16:50.172
It's unbelievable.

16:51.265 --> 16:54.349
Well, we entertain ourselves, you see.

16:54.369 --> 16:55.751
Oh, and it goes on, in other words.

16:55.772 --> 16:59.337
You see any of the talk shows and the quotes and this stuff.

16:59.397 --> 17:10.253
Yeah, but then we get, oh, look, this fraudulent contract drawn up for Marilyn Monroe, where she would not.

17:10.273 --> 17:10.553
St.

17:10.573 --> 17:10.873
Grish.

17:11.354 --> 17:13.998
And this is one of our great reporters, I thought.

17:14.138 --> 17:15.240
Yeah, Pulitzer Prize winner.

17:15.480 --> 17:20.968
And why the hell would a man of that seeming quality publish such a book?

17:21.370 --> 17:23.032
Yeah.

17:23.632 --> 17:29.659
There have been some really good books about the Kennedys.

17:29.679 --> 17:33.983
I don't think there need to be any more, except that you can sell a book with the name of it.

17:34.003 --> 17:36.106
Unless you're going to tell me something we don't already know.

17:36.486 --> 17:41.732
Well, I want to know what the fuck happened to Chaputty.

17:46.517 --> 17:47.698
Excuse me this morning.

17:49.467 --> 17:54.814
I've got to tell you, I love that line where your father is going through the red light and he says, so shoot me.

17:56.717 --> 18:07.251
My father, who's 86, the death is a stone, two years ago was driving a little BMW and stopped and got hit by a train by 16 boxcars.

18:07.852 --> 18:08.753
And he survived.

18:08.773 --> 18:12.798
The thing was just enough over the thing and he kept his feet on his foot.

18:12.818 --> 18:19.407
He couldn't even, well, finally when the train stopped and the car was still running and his foot was frozen to the,

18:19.741 --> 18:23.806
to the break, and he actually literally had to try him out.

18:23.826 --> 18:27.010
And then they're going to charge him for, you know, this and that.

18:27.250 --> 18:32.957
And he didn't say, so shoot me, but his reaction was, hey, I'm 85 years old.

18:32.977 --> 18:34.779
You know, throw me in jail.

18:34.799 --> 18:35.881
What are you going to do?

18:35.901 --> 18:38.284
It's wonderful, wonderful, so shoot me, he says.

18:38.324 --> 18:41.287
And in your instance, he'd already lost a loved one.

18:41.347 --> 18:48.516
You know, it's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful thing.

18:49.627 --> 18:54.111
You know, one of your reviewers, I don't know which and whom, but talks about it.

18:54.131 --> 18:58.716
This is a clever way to do a novel as memoir, memoir as novel.

18:59.016 --> 19:02.540
If you were to categorize this book, give it a genre, what would you call it?

19:02.560 --> 19:03.461
It's not my problem.

19:04.161 --> 19:05.483
It's my problem.

19:05.503 --> 19:06.964
No, it's not even your problem.

19:07.024 --> 19:12.370
I think it's some kind of wordplay that I've, go ahead.

19:12.390 --> 19:16.714
I spoke at Ohio Wesleyan three nights ago.

19:18.989 --> 19:26.759
And one person said, you know, a couple of people have called you a postmodernist.

19:27.941 --> 19:31.626
Do you accept this?

19:31.646 --> 19:32.848
And I didn't have a clue.

19:33.148 --> 19:39.196
And, you know, I said it's like the character in Mollier who was delighted to find out he was writing the prose.

19:39.216 --> 19:42.841
He hadn't realized it.

19:42.861 --> 19:44.303
Do you know what?

19:44.323 --> 19:47.427
Can you explain to my satisfaction what a postmodernist is?

19:47.626 --> 19:56.898
But that phrase has been so... Well, I'll tell you that I was born when I was in 1922.

19:56.918 --> 20:15.581
I was fortunate to have writers ahead of me about, you know, 20 years old who were breaking all sorts of grounds with really good political thinking.

20:15.941 --> 20:16.061
Right.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.363
It does pass up.

20:17.579 --> 20:22.644
Steinbeck and Rick Caldwell and so forth.

20:22.744 --> 20:24.947
It's interesting you're naming all American writers here.

20:25.487 --> 20:27.169
Very interesting.

20:27.189 --> 20:27.970
Is this your compass?

20:28.070 --> 20:29.551
I guess your fictional compass?

20:30.432 --> 20:32.595
It's the people from New York.

20:33.796 --> 20:35.317
I guess Boston.

20:35.337 --> 20:36.098
Face of Europe.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.442
My center of gravity.

20:42.865 --> 20:45.488
And we don't look across the Atlantic.

20:45.508 --> 20:46.489
We don't look across any other

20:47.633 --> 20:52.500
But, I think the leading edge stuff was happening here, though, in many respects.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.285
If you throw up James Joyce in 1922 or 1924.

20:55.425 --> 20:58.570
Yeah, no, well, even so.

20:58.850 --> 21:06.422
Yeah, I'll go ahead.

21:06.442 --> 21:07.363
See if they're driving.

21:09.217 --> 21:13.523
And I'll tell you, the book is really not in my block off.

21:13.603 --> 21:17.810
You know, when I say my friends indicate to me, I grew up in a half full of books that nobody had read.

21:17.830 --> 21:23.157
There were people who bought books and never would read them.

21:23.197 --> 21:27.003
They were uncut pages.

21:27.023 --> 21:31.870
But the Scooter River Anthology, it was quite a different foot in the west.

21:31.890 --> 21:37.418
But also, out there, the Civil War,

21:38.377 --> 21:43.222
It's part of the American passion.

21:43.242 --> 21:45.745
And in New York, it's not.

21:45.765 --> 21:49.729
Chris, they didn't fight the civil war out there, so maybe that's why it's folk war out that way.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.010
No, they fought it, of course.

21:51.030 --> 21:52.552
They did terrible casualties.

21:52.592 --> 21:53.753
In the Midwest?

21:53.773 --> 21:54.554
Well, I'm sure.

21:54.674 --> 21:58.698
Heavy casualties in Gettysburg and everywhere else.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.221
Okay, well, that's Pennsylvania, but I'm sure that's the Midwest.

22:01.241 --> 22:03.883
No, the Indiana people, don't you?

22:03.944 --> 22:04.925
The Indiana.

22:04.945 --> 22:08.248
What the hell are the Maine people doing in Gettysburg?

22:08.583 --> 22:09.444
Pennsylvania?

22:09.504 --> 22:11.247
Well, they got marched there.

22:12.009 --> 22:13.271
That's right.

22:13.291 --> 22:13.751
That's right.

22:13.771 --> 22:14.032
That's right.

22:14.052 --> 22:15.654
That's right.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.763
Is Slaughterhouse-Fakery the defining novel, the defining work?

22:20.783 --> 22:25.630
It was reviewed on the front page of the New York Times, and I had been ignored up to then.

22:25.650 --> 22:27.974
Cat's Cradle was never reviewed.

22:27.994 --> 22:29.497
Well, the night was never reviewed.

22:29.617 --> 22:34.084
Fire in the Titan was never reviewed.

22:34.351 --> 22:57.012
I read all of these, by the way, one after the other, when I was on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific during Vietnam in the 60s, and we had them, and we read them, and then the books that you're mentioning right now, one after the other, and read them in the body, and I did not know that these other books... So you were, as far as the Times was concerned, an unknown writer up to the arrival of them.

22:57.092 --> 23:03.818
No, I was operating in a negligible zone, supposedly, with science fiction for...

23:04.743 --> 23:08.547
because they weren't reading me.

23:08.587 --> 23:30.109
They were the person who was a big time critic for the Times or Newsweek or Time Magazine or New York Review of Books had enough to read already without, you know, investigating detective stories and teenage novels and all that shit.

23:30.663 --> 23:39.173
Because, you know, it's a tough job they've got, it's a kind of a mighty amount of material they have to practice about the process.

23:39.193 --> 23:40.594
And so, they were relieved.

23:41.495 --> 23:56.873
But interestingly enough, Penn, the American Writers' Organization, is self-perpetuatingly a membership committee of mid-term people, and members nominate other people.

24:00.228 --> 24:04.093
No science fiction writers and no detectives doing that.

24:04.113 --> 24:04.793
They're not serious.

24:06.215 --> 24:07.216
Still to this day?

24:07.677 --> 24:10.160
It may have changed some, but I know it.

24:10.280 --> 24:17.409
I was really amazed when they realized that back when we were host to an international congress, which was, what, 20 years ago?

24:17.429 --> 24:22.174
They invited me in on the script with my own book, which is nice.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.717
Well, I think they loosened up after that.

24:24.737 --> 24:28.682
Well, for one thing, anything

24:28.882 --> 24:31.685
and its headquarters in New York, because guess what?

24:32.386 --> 24:33.487
The New York Club.

24:33.507 --> 24:34.508
That's it.

24:34.528 --> 24:38.433
I love it when they send you the stuff and bring you down to the meetings in New York.

24:38.453 --> 24:43.879
The issues are totally just, those are the things you... Well, Boston does have a... Yeah, it does.

24:43.899 --> 24:48.404
That chapter, and Justin Kaplan, and... Jim Carroll.

24:48.424 --> 24:48.524
Yeah.

24:48.544 --> 24:49.926
Good guy, James Carroll.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.428
Yes, well, right.

24:52.448 --> 24:53.830
I don't have to think up too much of your time.

24:53.870 --> 24:54.771
I do love the...

24:55.173 --> 25:00.000
a person's living and dead are purely coincidental, I have to say.

25:00.821 --> 25:06.390
And also the fact that you do dedicate the book to Simo Alaric is quite an interesting way.

25:06.410 --> 25:07.832
I just mentioned him briefly.

25:08.994 --> 25:14.742
One of the least appreciated editors, I think, today.

25:14.883 --> 25:23.796
Well, he was at the Atlantic for a long time, but he had his office there on the edge of the garden.

25:24.991 --> 25:29.175
I used to visit him there, and he used to lunch every day at the Ritz.

25:30.957 --> 25:35.602
He drank a lot of the Harry's.

25:38.425 --> 25:45.452
He picked up a group of us, which I guess were defined by our audience.

25:46.573 --> 25:48.575
Yeah, we had the same audience.

25:48.595 --> 25:53.040
Sometimes I was interested in being me and Richard Browdy.

25:53.982 --> 26:02.772
All of us who worked, we thought we were doing the same people by any people.

26:02.792 --> 26:04.113
But, yeah, I miss that.

26:04.133 --> 26:04.754
He saved my life.

26:04.774 --> 26:07.057
I would have been doing so much for a living.

26:07.077 --> 26:10.661
I would have had to go into business somehow.

26:10.681 --> 26:14.806
I have a comment of your kid that your father was a famous.

26:14.826 --> 26:17.248
He was selling cars, I don't remember, an operator.

26:17.529 --> 26:18.069
Sure.

26:18.089 --> 26:21.373
I was working for it.

26:21.826 --> 26:23.788
industrial ad agency up here.

26:23.808 --> 26:28.514
It was like, you get that kind of job, because I've done it for General Electric years ago.

26:28.534 --> 26:33.641
And, uh, it was Thomas Churrup.

26:33.661 --> 26:36.584
And I just, they were so goddamn stingy.

26:36.604 --> 26:41.410
I said, all right, I've got balls enough to win the business, too.

26:41.430 --> 26:46.216
Uh, this car carrier went by with all those little Easter eggs on them.

26:47.298 --> 26:49.040
The VWs were very hot.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.922
People were crazy about little cars.

26:52.100 --> 26:57.685
I followed this thing into a garage that was happening there where the app agency was.

26:57.885 --> 26:58.226
I don't know.

26:59.147 --> 27:00.288
Asked what the hell they were.

27:02.249 --> 27:12.159
And, uh, the temporary headquarters, you know, on the weekend, I went down there and asked if I could be a dealer.

27:15.021 --> 27:21.027
And, uh, boy, I, you know, I said that I was very lucky being

27:22.222 --> 27:27.749
taking advertising and jobs or PR jobs or whatever, when things were bad.

27:28.871 --> 27:31.754
I'd never had a contemptible account, you know.

27:31.834 --> 27:34.818
I'd never represented a dictator or a product.

27:34.838 --> 27:35.599
It was lousy.

27:37.342 --> 27:45.412
But then I was desperately trying to sell sobs, and it was an awful time.

27:45.432 --> 27:46.574
I had one.

27:46.594 --> 27:47.114
He died on me.

27:47.134 --> 27:48.356
I hate that son of a bitch.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.638
I hate that in California.

27:49.778 --> 27:50.018
I saw it.

27:50.167 --> 27:52.029
You had to mix oil with the gas.

27:52.109 --> 27:53.490
It was like a lawnmower.

27:53.570 --> 27:54.691
Yeah.

27:54.711 --> 27:55.812
And it was like a light bulb.

27:55.832 --> 27:58.915
It would be working one day, and the next day it would be gone.

27:58.935 --> 28:01.257
Well, I'm glad you didn't kill the dealer.

28:01.277 --> 28:02.538
He's probably a friend of mine.

28:02.558 --> 28:02.959
I don't know.

28:02.979 --> 28:03.960
It was San Francisco.

28:04.060 --> 28:05.901
I mean, it was terrible.

28:05.921 --> 28:11.487
But the guys who bought them was the Air Force Base there on the Cape.

28:11.587 --> 28:11.887
Otis.

28:12.427 --> 28:13.008
Yeah, Otis.

28:13.128 --> 28:14.990
And those guys are crazy about machinery.

28:17.172 --> 28:18.553
And he could driveâlisten.

28:19.107 --> 28:20.429
Don't crabble about the job.

28:20.449 --> 28:23.253
It could drag a VW to stoplight.

28:23.393 --> 28:24.976
If you explore it, leave it.

28:25.657 --> 28:29.483
And if you had changed your spark plugs recently.

28:29.503 --> 28:34.049
So let me tell you, are you going to hear from Kilgore now, or is he now safely retired?

28:34.490 --> 28:35.151
I'll retire.

28:35.892 --> 28:36.133
I'll retire.

28:36.153 --> 28:37.755
So what are you going to do with that?

28:37.775 --> 28:39.458
Well, I make pictures.

28:39.478 --> 28:40.179
I write letters.

28:40.759 --> 28:41.821
I write a lot of letters.

28:41.841 --> 28:43.263
I write short little stuff.

28:43.363 --> 28:46.448
I write short little stuff about the NYC, you know.

28:47.457 --> 28:49.339
I keep busy, farting around.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.643
Some people have no gift for farting around.

28:52.723 --> 28:53.043
I do.

28:54.284 --> 28:55.486
Make a day disappear.

28:57.247 --> 29:00.131
I see how I can change that verb in my piece here.

29:02.934 --> 29:05.376
I promised Michael I wouldn't take off too much of your time.

29:05.817 --> 29:07.178
It's been very pleasant.

29:07.198 --> 29:08.199
I don't like so well.

29:08.219 --> 29:10.642
I'm glad to know you, and I want to look for your book.

29:10.762 --> 29:15.507
That's charming that you find out how I've been taking off.

29:15.740 --> 29:19.764
Well, the title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

29:20.044 --> 29:24.728
I didn't know this, but up until Slaughterhouse-Five, you hadn't been reviewed.

29:24.768 --> 29:32.635
So I asked you if that was the defining... What was there about that book that finally persuaded them that you should be, that you demanded attention?

29:33.276 --> 29:35.358
Well, Sam Lodge would be part of it.

29:35.818 --> 29:36.419
Oh, sorry, what is it?

29:36.459 --> 29:42.024
Sam Lodge, who was hanging out at the Century Club in one place or another, and at the Harvard Club and all that.

29:43.005 --> 29:44.346
I was all excited about it.

29:44.798 --> 29:55.631
And people who read it were finally persuaded to take a look at it.

29:56.993 --> 29:58.955
You remember the ones that hurt, don't you?

29:58.995 --> 30:04.382
Well, your book would be attacked.

30:04.402 --> 30:08.286
No, I got a bad review on Publishers Weekly, of all kinds of things.

30:08.306 --> 30:12.932
I had a guy in L.A.

30:13.233 --> 30:20.441
There was a copy editor from Variety, I mean, some dead-end son of a bitch, and said it was, you know, whatever it was.

30:20.461 --> 30:23.564
I could quote it, but there's no need to.

30:23.605 --> 30:28.910
Yeah, I got a couple of bad ones, and most of them were really good, but you do remember the ones that wound.

30:30.172 --> 30:35.798
Some people don't get joked, or they think if you make jokes that you're not a serious person.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.211
I mean, I can't help it.

30:40.351 --> 30:42.113
It's hard to do, actually.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.194
It's a nice skill to have.

30:43.214 --> 30:43.935
It's to be funny.

30:44.195 --> 30:45.076
Is it hard to be funny?

30:45.757 --> 30:49.921
Not for me, but it is for most people.

30:49.941 --> 30:51.843
Well, Herbert talked a little about it.

30:52.104 --> 31:03.135
He wrote some good essays on humor and everything, but he talked about The Scarlet Letter.

31:03.503 --> 31:11.352
The author missed the opportunity to see the comedy, putting on this big letter A every day.

31:11.372 --> 31:17.820
I would have started playing with that idea.

31:18.060 --> 31:19.141
You don't ask you to do it.

31:19.161 --> 31:20.443
Nobody else is asking you to do this.

31:21.023 --> 31:23.346
Say hi right there on that memo.

31:25.028 --> 31:28.933
Because it's a memo with your name on it.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.174
Makes us a unique poem.

31:32.016 --> 31:32.717
I really do.

31:35.633 --> 31:39.777
It was the business story of the century.

31:39.797 --> 31:43.741
In two years, I only lost $35,000.

31:43.761 --> 31:44.302
Wow.

31:44.322 --> 31:45.643
That's not bad.

31:45.663 --> 31:46.584
That's okay.

31:46.604 --> 31:51.710
I'm all set, Michael.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.932
I told you I'd do it in half an hour.

31:54.653 --> 31:56.535
That's great.

31:56.655 --> 31:57.936
Once again, three years, okay?

31:57.956 --> 31:58.096
Yeah.

31:58.537 --> 32:04.763
Well, it's about how nice nonsense makes life for us.

32:05.266 --> 32:15.601
You know, he's fed up with all these theologians and taking translators that he's working with and everything, and please don't be so serious.

32:16.181 --> 32:26.916
And what Paul Engle, founder of the Writers' Workshop out there in Iowa, he said, if we ever got a building, the Writers' Workshop ever got a building, we did.

32:28.739 --> 32:35.188
But over the doorway, he was going to write, don't take yourself so seriously.

32:36.097 --> 32:37.462
is the kicker to my story.

32:37.502 --> 32:38.385
You know what the kicker is?

32:38.886 --> 32:40.010
The way you end it.

32:40.753 --> 32:44.385
I know what my lead is, now I've got my kicker.
