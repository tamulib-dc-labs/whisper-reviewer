WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:05.624
Edward, how do we pronounce your name, just for the record?

00:05.644 --> 00:06.245
Cassinette.

00:06.265 --> 00:08.247
Cassinette, just the word.

00:08.267 --> 00:10.449
Exactly, in New York.

00:10.469 --> 00:16.955
Why don't you just, if you don't like starting again, at least picking up so there's a context for the case.

00:17.315 --> 00:23.681
What I tried to do was to simply... The red light's on, right?

00:23.701 --> 00:24.141
Yeah, I know.

00:24.161 --> 00:31.388
I simply tried to set a framework for you for art

00:31.975 --> 00:58.742
specific discussion, and what I was indicating was that during most of the Soviet period, the seventy-some-odd years, the historiography on the book as it was presented in Russia had a number of very important assumptions.

00:59.718 --> 01:29.016
first one being that all of these diverse ethnic groups, and we're talking about a country that goes through X number of time zones, from the Caucasian groups to the Central Asian groups to the peoples of Northern Russia, the Yakuts, the Chukchins, all of these groups, that their book cultures were always interpreted as

01:29.738 --> 01:48.410
within the context of the present structure of the Soviet Union, and their book cultures projected backwards and made to appear as if... As a matter of state policy, they were projected backwards?

01:48.430 --> 01:55.122
This is a matter, yes, of state policy and of state interpretation, that these groups were in somehow

01:55.473 --> 02:01.861
destined to be incorporated into the 20th century, into this socialist communist state.

02:03.262 --> 02:05.806
And so you have very anomalous things happen.

02:05.826 --> 02:22.746
When you would pick up a textbook on bibliography or history of libraries, you would see these histories being studied to the early years, you know, early millennia, and

02:24.025 --> 02:39.069
And diverse ethnic groups pulled in, even though religiously and in terms of scripts and in terms of book cultures, they were very, very heterogeneous.

02:41.553 --> 02:51.248
And the second point that I would make is that the influence of Soviet writing about the book

02:53.101 --> 03:03.451
was immense because their writings were published in vast tirages.

03:03.471 --> 03:05.873
What would be a vast tirage for us?

03:05.913 --> 03:07.154
What is that word?

03:07.174 --> 03:07.654
Print run.

03:08.976 --> 03:09.716
Print run.

03:09.736 --> 03:11.298
Would you say the word once more?

03:11.418 --> 03:12.539
Tirage.

03:12.559 --> 03:13.019
Tirage.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.601
That's a Russian word.

03:14.621 --> 03:18.745
No, it's a cauch from the French, originally.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.106
How do you spell it?

03:20.306 --> 03:21.387
T-I-R-A-Z-H.

03:22.008 --> 03:40.967
So for example, a book like yours, in the period of high socialism, high communism, it would not be unusual for a book like yours to maybe be printed in 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 copies.

03:41.007 --> 03:42.149
You wouldn't even bat an eye.

03:42.329 --> 03:45.372
And you would have no problem in publishing it.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.374
You wouldn't have to particularly go

03:48.940 --> 03:52.323
Make a market for it, as I mentioned.

03:52.343 --> 03:53.404
Right, exactly.

03:53.624 --> 04:00.130
Or certainly justify the fact that there's a market that would justify its being published.

04:00.150 --> 04:00.610
Exactly.

04:00.630 --> 04:15.443
You wouldn't have to do it because you'd be a member of a library, you'd be a member of some scholarly academy, and this work would be put into your work plan over a period of five years.

04:15.483 --> 04:18.846
You would be paid, and so you'd get an honorarium,

04:18.944 --> 04:20.025
its publication.

04:20.085 --> 04:45.778
Now, I think that the subsidies, the support of scholarship and of libraries explains why you do have this vast amount of bibliographical book culture publishing.

04:46.990 --> 04:50.375
things that would be very difficult to float in the West.

04:52.338 --> 05:15.073
The next thing that I would just observe is that as other Eastern European countries came into the Soviet orbit in the 20th century, Soviet Russian library structures, book culture, also had a tremendous influence on them, on Bulgaria.

05:16.235 --> 05:34.697
on Poland, on the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the former Yugoslavia, all of them, to one degree or another, began to take on the character of what was going on in Russia.

05:34.717 --> 05:43.508
And the official ideology of scholarship until very recent times were

05:44.467 --> 05:51.694
Marxist, Leninist views of the role of the book.

05:54.377 --> 05:58.140
So, for example... Well, it was a political role, again, to go back to that work.

05:58.160 --> 05:58.621
Exactly.

05:59.682 --> 06:04.647
And what, for example, you would have... Books served their purpose.

06:05.347 --> 06:05.988
Absolutely.

06:06.208 --> 06:14.136
And libraries served a purpose of direction, rather than

06:15.179 --> 06:20.925
In information, and let me put a finer point on this.

06:20.945 --> 06:29.655
When you look in any history of book culture, and I keep using that term because it's a shorthand for me.

06:29.675 --> 06:30.636
The book culture phrase?

06:30.736 --> 06:30.977
Yeah.

06:31.437 --> 06:33.980
It means... Maybe we should have a working definition of it.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.380
Okay.

06:34.400 --> 06:43.971
It means everything that relates to the history of readership, to the history of libraries, to the history of bibliography,

06:44.710 --> 07:00.166
to the history of book circulation, to the history of topography, to the history of bibliophilism, to the history of book collecting, that whole gamut of problems.

07:00.186 --> 07:09.515
And there were a couple of assumptions that governed what was produced in this century.

07:10.076 --> 07:13.519
Number one, the great role of

07:14.427 --> 07:16.490
economic forces.

07:17.812 --> 07:37.161
So you had tremendous interest in topography, in the printing industry, in how these industries developed, tremendous interest in the role of women,

07:37.715 --> 07:46.363
of the socialist book publishers, of the late 90s, social democratic book publishers, late 19th, early 20th century.

07:47.504 --> 08:07.182
A lack of interest and distortion of religious book collectors, of people who were high arts of the church, or religious figures, the diminution of the

08:07.567 --> 08:17.281
lack of emphasis on the religious book, religious book printing.

08:17.301 --> 08:19.204
Can I ask you a question?

08:19.224 --> 08:19.384
Yeah.

08:19.404 --> 08:27.295
Were there legitimate book collectors in the Soviet Union during the Soviet period?

08:27.315 --> 08:28.237
Absolutely.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.218
Were they underground?

08:30.119 --> 08:31.321
Were they able to operate?

08:33.083 --> 08:36.308
Did they have to be a member of the government or the party?

08:37.013 --> 08:46.282
I mean, was there an approved form of focus, like, you know, in the writing?

08:46.322 --> 08:47.343
Socialist realism.

08:47.383 --> 08:49.465
I mean, if you went outside of that, you got in deep trouble.

08:49.545 --> 08:50.126
Okay.

08:50.146 --> 09:02.378
Let me say the following, that there are two levels on which I can answer your question.

09:02.438 --> 09:06.582
What if you wanted to collect decadent American fiction or something like that?

09:06.697 --> 09:17.072
I think you would have... Let me... You don't mind my throwing out questions like that?

09:17.092 --> 09:17.213
No.

09:17.233 --> 09:18.154
It's a dialogue.

09:18.254 --> 09:24.924
I want to clarify.

09:24.944 --> 09:35.860
Before 1917, in the 17th, 18th, 19th century,

09:36.869 --> 09:41.655
There were fantastic nuclear files in Russia.

09:42.076 --> 09:58.758
And again, keep in mind that we're talking today mostly about the Russian Empire, as opposed to the rest of Eastern Europe.

09:58.778 --> 10:04.446
Because we could talk about Bohemia, Czech,

10:04.730 --> 10:10.717
we could talk about Yugoslav, former Yugoslav on its own, in a similar vein.

10:13.540 --> 10:31.902
Before the revolution, there were fantastic book collectors, mostly people who had significant wealth, wealth that was built from

10:34.784 --> 10:46.402
on some kind of concession, on some kind of manufacturing, whether it was textile or whether it was some kind of concessions for alcohol or whatever.

10:48.185 --> 11:00.825
Then there were, of course, members of the gentry and the nobility, who were also major, major collectors, which would rival any library,

11:01.447 --> 11:05.733
that you could possibly study in America or Europe?

11:06.634 --> 11:08.437
Will we be able to document a few of these?

11:11.161 --> 11:11.381
No problem.

11:11.401 --> 11:12.503
And of course, what happened to these?

11:12.683 --> 11:17.129
I don't mean to jump ahead, but what happened when the Soviets took over?

11:17.149 --> 11:18.411
Well, you can guess.

11:21.656 --> 11:30.829
Major private collections before the Revolution were housed on people's estates and monasteries.

11:31.619 --> 11:38.610
estate houses and their townhouses in the major cities.

11:38.630 --> 12:00.242
And after the revolution, the government, of course, and I'm really capsulizing here, the government made claims to collections whose value transcended

12:00.458 --> 12:29.537
simply personal interest, they took on a national character, they were nationalized, confiscated, libraries, divided up, reallocated, to this collection, to this collection, to create some of the monster libraries, and I retract that term, not monster libraries, but super libraries, the Lenin Library, the Salterkosche, although they existed before, I mean, they made them,

12:29.838 --> 12:31.580
gargantuan collection.

12:31.640 --> 12:38.288
Will we be able to document some of these individual collections?

12:38.308 --> 12:45.116
Is this kind of, in a way, a replication of what happened in England when we had the dissolution of the monasteries?

12:45.977 --> 12:50.101
Except that in England, the stuff was destroyed in a wholesale manner.

12:50.642 --> 12:59.372
But I'm wondering if it did evolve, because you had a, you know, this was philosophical, it was religious,

13:01.124 --> 13:03.207
And here it's political.

13:03.467 --> 13:06.411
I'm wondering if it was a similar kind of a thing.

13:06.851 --> 13:09.154
There are... Sir, I'm stretching it here.

13:09.194 --> 13:14.301
No, at all points in history, one could find analogies to what went on in Russia.

13:14.321 --> 13:18.627
But here we're talking about the scale was enormous.

13:18.647 --> 13:20.990
This is a vast, vast empire.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.554
And there's various parts.

13:24.574 --> 13:26.997
I don't think this has been written about, has it?

13:27.338 --> 13:28.279
It hasn't been...

13:30.571 --> 13:39.621
You know, it couldn't really have been easily written about because we didn't have the perspective that we have in 97.

13:40.482 --> 13:49.453
After all, it's now been 10 years since things began to unravel in Eastern Europe.

13:49.473 --> 13:58.603
The Velvet Revolution and the Czech Republic and other political perturbations in Poland and suddenly eventually the collapse of... What I'm saying is...

13:59.377 --> 14:04.184
This is strictly, you know, I'm here thinking as a writer and looking for opportunities.

14:05.125 --> 14:11.134
I think I have an opportunity here to write about something that hasn't really been done.

14:11.154 --> 14:16.502
I mean, I think it's... Is that a fair... I think so.

14:17.864 --> 14:18.485
I think so.

14:18.685 --> 14:29.080
I don't know really of... of anyone who in...

14:29.313 --> 14:51.359
in English, has looked upon the development of book culture in that part of the world, and when I say that part of the world, all of Eastern Europe going from the borders with Germany all the way to the Pacific, with some kind of distance.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.042
I see this is a good opportunity.

14:54.423 --> 14:58.948
And particularly if you were able...

15:01.207 --> 15:09.295
to properly focus on some of the key people, some of the key events.

15:10.396 --> 15:12.318
Do you think we can more or less identify them?

15:12.538 --> 15:19.565
Yeah, I think we can, and I want to just finish what... I'm sorry, you don't mind my... No.

15:19.605 --> 15:22.748
Because if I don't say things, I forget them, too, or I lose them.

15:23.129 --> 15:29.695
What I wanted, just to finish your question about the bibliophiles, in the Soviet period,

15:31.413 --> 15:35.297
There were tremendous opportunities for book collectors.

15:35.477 --> 15:46.930
If you were an academic, or if you were a collector, you had... For Soviet book collectors, not for people who were outside the Soviet Union, don't you mean?

15:46.950 --> 15:52.796
No, I mean for people who lived in the period... Who lived in the Soviet Union.

15:52.816 --> 15:53.637
Right, exactly.

15:53.957 --> 15:58.382
Because there were tremendous restrictions on travel until very recently.

15:59.273 --> 16:02.676
So they were in a kind of hermetic society.

16:02.696 --> 16:12.324
They could travel relatively easily within the Soviet Union, because travel was cheap.

16:12.344 --> 16:20.091
You could get on a train and go to Moscow, or to go to the Empire of Petrovsk, or to go to Khabarovsk.

16:20.111 --> 16:21.993
That was not a problem.

16:22.013 --> 16:25.476
You couldn't get out of it, out of the borders.

16:25.496 --> 16:27.778
You could go to other socialist countries easily.

16:28.619 --> 16:29.200
And they did.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.164
They went in vast numbers.

16:32.184 --> 16:42.016
But they were always kind of feeding their collecting on themselves, so to speak.

16:42.137 --> 16:50.027
In other words, they had excellent opportunities within the country to buy things cheaply.

16:50.047 --> 16:56.175
If you were, for example, a major writer in Russia, you would be getting significant honorarium.

16:56.195 --> 16:57.917
You would be living reasonably well.

16:58.505 --> 17:04.192
For example, a couple of blocks down from here, there's again Yevtushenko, the poet.

17:04.252 --> 17:05.914
He lives here.

17:06.435 --> 17:13.684
He has a university professorship at Queens College, which is across the lake here.

17:13.704 --> 17:18.450
And a person like Yevtushenko lived like a king.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.551
He was in favor.

17:19.891 --> 17:20.792
He was in favor.

17:21.113 --> 17:22.875
But it gave him money.

17:23.429 --> 17:25.312
gave him prestige.

17:25.332 --> 17:30.860
He would go into a bookstore by antiquarian books, by, you know, beautiful dealer.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.682
I'm sure he did.

17:32.762 --> 17:34.084
Go and ask him.

17:34.104 --> 17:36.568
But maybe we will.

17:36.648 --> 17:44.018
Let me show you one thing that may just put a finer point in it.

17:44.158 --> 17:45.701
Excuse me.

17:45.721 --> 17:46.582
Does he speak English?

17:50.788 --> 17:52.711
Oh, of course.

17:52.731 --> 17:53.031
OK, good.

17:53.247 --> 17:56.655
Here's a book.

17:56.796 --> 18:07.442
And some of these people I actually have met, some of them are now gone.

18:22.373 --> 18:24.416
We're looking for a tissue.

18:24.436 --> 18:24.917
Oh, great.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.321
Thank you.

18:27.341 --> 18:30.407
I'm at the tail end of a cold here.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.716
Christina Burris.

18:36.437 --> 18:37.559
Okay.

18:37.579 --> 18:41.225
But I don't want to dwell on this.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.048
I just want to get the title done.

18:53.373 --> 19:06.111
That's true.

19:06.131 --> 19:07.452
There's an apartment.

19:08.574 --> 19:14.182
That doesn't look like it was interrupted during any... She was okay.

19:14.202 --> 19:14.542
So why?

19:14.622 --> 19:15.684
Why did they protect her?

19:15.704 --> 19:17.206
Why did they allow her to live?

19:17.226 --> 19:23.194
Because there are... I don't know.

19:24.018 --> 19:26.260
Is this a Russian book?

19:27.441 --> 19:30.485
I had to say, is this book published in Russia?

19:30.625 --> 19:32.266
No, it was published in the West.

19:32.286 --> 19:35.630
But I could find, the only reason I published one of it is it's very dramatic.

19:36.230 --> 19:38.072
In a person's apartment, really bites me.

19:41.075 --> 19:42.457
And showing some of his.

19:44.759 --> 19:44.979
Wow.

19:47.662 --> 19:47.962
So, here it is.

19:47.982 --> 19:52.607
And this is just being revealed again now, right?

19:53.093 --> 19:57.698
And here's another guy who collects paintings.

19:57.718 --> 19:57.918
Wow.

19:58.879 --> 20:01.882
And so on and so on.

20:02.003 --> 20:08.530
Now... Can I get the name of the publisher of this book?

20:08.550 --> 20:09.651
Sure, absolutely.

20:09.671 --> 20:14.897
I can figure out how I'm ready to see the book.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.158
Taurus, who are they?

20:16.178 --> 20:16.779
Oh, good idea.

20:18.020 --> 20:18.320
T-A-U-R.

20:19.001 --> 20:20.923
Taurus, K-A-R-K-E book.

20:22.928 --> 20:23.829
London, New York.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.973
And what year was this?

20:25.993 --> 20:31.362
This was 92.

20:31.382 --> 20:40.877
No, my point is about whether these people were able to... I think you just demonstrated that.

20:40.897 --> 20:41.738
I mean, you see the point.

20:41.859 --> 20:50.252
I could take, you know, in Russian, any number of books here to, you know, show what private collectors were

20:51.430 --> 20:52.071
we're doing.

20:52.091 --> 20:57.238
As a matter of fact, it is privileged, and privileged, to know a number of people.

20:57.258 --> 21:08.793
So, for example, going to a person's apartment, he's a geologist, and who does a lot of consulting work on mineral deposits in Russia.

21:08.813 --> 21:15.281
Fantastic collection of early 20th century books from the world of art.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.045
And very often he has

21:18.616 --> 21:29.091
all of the designs for the book, the sketches that went into the making of the book, in one part of his apartment, and the other part, he has the actual book in new conditions.

21:29.111 --> 21:43.111
I'm talking about books that, if sold on the Western market, would be in the tens of thousands of dollars, books by Yeltsin, and so on, and so on, and so on, the future's books.

21:43.131 --> 21:45.815
Now, that's one example.

21:45.855 --> 21:47.678
Then you go into another apartment,

21:48.265 --> 22:05.805
Another friend of mine who now lives in Berlin, he emigrated and he's past living in Moscow in Berlin, went to his apartment to see books of 18th century, fantastic binding, exquisite cabinets, and so on.

22:05.825 --> 22:17.158
And all of these people went about their business in the Soviet period with the great straw, because to get access to these people was very difficult.

22:17.577 --> 22:41.359
And only after checking, cross-checking, and so on, people don't let you into their circle without knowing who you are, whether this is a person that can be trusted, whether this is a discreet person.

22:41.379 --> 22:46.504
So collecting went on, but almost in a kind of padded,

22:47.243 --> 22:49.306
were violent.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.968
Because people did not want.

22:51.729 --> 22:53.512
Let's say that they collected, I don't know.

22:53.892 --> 23:00.682
Do you think we can find somebody, a book collector, who collected at a serious level?

23:00.702 --> 23:02.444
They're still there.

23:02.464 --> 23:07.752
I know, but I mean, an individual that I could talk to could tell me about this.

23:07.772 --> 23:14.321
I think that, Nick, let me make one other qualification.

23:14.341 --> 23:14.601
That

23:15.374 --> 23:30.232
Book collecting and bibliophilism in the Soviet period included millions of people.

23:30.673 --> 23:44.149
There was an official organization called the All Union Society of Bibliophiles, which had also Western members.

23:44.770 --> 23:48.353
I was never asked a joke.

23:48.413 --> 24:06.330
They had their own journal called, and let's go into the other room, just for one second, and I apologize.

24:06.390 --> 24:13.917
This to here is the Almanac of the Bibliophile, which was the official journal

24:15.820 --> 24:17.743
of the All-Union Society.

24:17.823 --> 24:25.355
Now, I just happened to pull this one off, and this proves my point, the point that I made earlier about how they interpreted it.

24:25.375 --> 24:28.100
The book in Mongolia.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.567
You're pointing to two Russian words, which translated as the book in Mongolia.

24:32.587 --> 24:33.508
The book in Mongolia.

24:33.668 --> 24:40.760
So in other words, this almanac, this Russian-language almanac, deals... I want to get some illuminated manuscripts here.

24:40.780 --> 24:40.960
Exactly.

24:41.701 --> 24:42.823
Deals with...

24:43.377 --> 24:47.441
the book, not in Russia, but in Mongolia, which was under Soviet domination.

24:47.902 --> 24:53.968
So, and here you have volumes, and it was begun in the probably early 60s.

24:54.749 --> 24:57.993
This journal here, again, proves my point.

24:58.353 --> 24:58.854
Look at this.

25:00.255 --> 25:11.067
Volume 1 through 70, the latest one has just come out in Russia, is called The Book.

25:11.127 --> 25:11.207
And

25:11.812 --> 25:21.000
It contains articles on the history of libraries, on the history of bibliography, history of book culture.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.582
Very important journals.

25:23.442 --> 25:24.363
What's the name of it again?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.684
The Book.

25:25.704 --> 25:27.386
The Book.

25:27.406 --> 25:31.069
And rather well produced.

25:33.151 --> 25:34.252
This is a scholarly.

25:39.477 --> 25:40.958
Published since 1959.

25:45.207 --> 25:54.702
Now, the reason I want to show you this, everything that you see here are journals, are multi-volume sets.

25:54.722 --> 25:59.249
This was a state-supported industry.

25:59.269 --> 26:08.043
And the organizations that existed got office space, they got subventions, they had their own journals.

26:08.424 --> 26:12.430
I mean, where in the United States do you have something analogous to this?

26:12.697 --> 26:18.207
an organization that has 18 million members, the All-Union Bibliophile Society.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.350
18 million members.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.552
18 million members.

26:20.672 --> 26:25.582
This was a major organization and had their own offices in Moscow, their own journals.

26:25.602 --> 26:26.603
This was one of their journals.

26:26.624 --> 26:27.906
They had other things that they published.

26:28.186 --> 26:31.633
They had conferences, et cetera, that would draw hundreds of people.

26:33.487 --> 26:35.169
as speakers.

26:35.269 --> 26:37.511
Now, did you acquire these all during the period?

26:37.671 --> 26:38.291
Absolutely.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.292
I was a student there.

26:39.793 --> 26:41.854
Where were you students?

26:41.874 --> 26:43.596
1971, in Moscow.

26:43.616 --> 26:45.658
I lived there 13 months.

26:45.678 --> 26:46.358
And studied where?

26:46.759 --> 26:47.640
Moscow University.

26:49.742 --> 26:57.388
With a man who also was a great specialist in bibliography, Sergei Sergeyevich Dmitry.

27:00.371 --> 27:02.633
And these are the works

27:03.608 --> 27:05.430
scholarly works of the Lennon Library.

27:06.891 --> 27:08.473
Here, they published their own journal.

27:09.433 --> 27:25.208
And these are major histories numbered of book people, of collectors, of bibliographers, and realized that all of this stuff is modern material.

27:25.429 --> 27:30.173
In other words, I don't have any rare books here.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.603
This is a working research library.

27:32.683 --> 27:35.167
It's a professional library, not a bibliophile.

27:35.788 --> 27:51.331
But if I had had the money or the opportunity, I could have gotten vast quantities of older 19th century, earlier bibliophilic or book studies literature.

27:51.792 --> 27:59.523
Now, let me mention this man here who lives in London, Professor Butler.

27:59.583 --> 28:00.244
He's a lawyer.

28:01.439 --> 28:02.400
B-U-T-L-E-R.

28:02.521 --> 28:02.841
Right.

28:03.722 --> 28:03.843
W.E.

28:03.863 --> 28:10.913
Butler, he's a professor, or a university professor in London University, and I'm also on the MP board in his journal.

28:10.933 --> 28:15.079
He's called Book Train International, but is very heavily dealing with Eastern Europe.

28:16.601 --> 28:24.613
As you can even see, for example, the earliest printed Russian ex-Lieber's Prince Galitza, 18th century.

28:24.633 --> 28:28.739
My point is that Butler was a foreign member of the Bibliophile Society.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.243
He was very much persona grata.

28:31.358 --> 28:32.259
Grata.

28:32.279 --> 28:33.140
During the Soviet.

28:33.441 --> 28:34.662
I'm going to London in March.

28:35.043 --> 28:36.204
Well, we can set up.

28:36.224 --> 28:37.526
You think it'd be worth my thing?

28:37.686 --> 28:44.595
The other person you must see when you're in England is the grand man of Eastern European book culture.

28:44.976 --> 28:47.199
It also is college John Simmons.

28:47.219 --> 28:48.220
John Simmons.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.143
He's in all souls.

28:50.283 --> 28:51.224
It's J.S.J.

28:52.125 --> 28:52.866
Simmons.

28:52.886 --> 28:53.046
S-Y?

28:53.227 --> 28:54.128
No, S-I.

28:55.470 --> 28:56.231
S-I-N-N-O-N-S.

28:59.235 --> 29:00.336
And all souls is...

29:00.755 --> 29:02.036
Cambridge or Oxford?

29:02.056 --> 29:02.276
Oxford.

29:03.217 --> 29:06.120
It's the greatest research college in Oxford.

29:06.140 --> 29:12.426
It's the one that learns of Arabia.

29:12.486 --> 29:15.749
John Simmons, again, is what?

29:15.789 --> 29:28.581
He is now in his 80s and is a fellow emeritus.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.643
He's retired.

29:31.872 --> 29:40.142
He knows an enormous amount about the history of the book.

29:40.162 --> 29:53.258
Bibliophilism was, you know, traveling to Russia even into the 60s, and knew many of the great collectors and bibliophiles.

29:55.260 --> 30:01.508
So let me just summarize your question.

30:01.943 --> 30:16.996
summarizes that, that in addition to a vast number of very important collectors, for example, academician Markushevich, great physicist, who collected Western internavula.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.458
I knew him.

30:19.478 --> 30:23.162
He died probably, what, ten years ago.

30:23.182 --> 30:29.187
You had these top collectors during the Soviet period.

30:29.207 --> 30:30.448
You also had

30:30.918 --> 30:39.991
bibliophilism, book collecting, librarianship, book culture studies, flourishing because of state's adventures.

30:42.054 --> 30:52.088
And you had hundreds of people, maybe thousands of people, writing books, compiling catalogs.

30:53.169 --> 31:00.840
There's even an encyclopedia of book culture that was gone.

31:06.862 --> 31:09.505
a book culture, an encyclopedic dictionary.

31:15.470 --> 31:28.523
And so, you know, you had articles on libraries, on bookmen, on publishing, on book illustration.

31:32.366 --> 31:33.207
That's fascinating.

31:34.182 --> 31:40.350
And it includes all of the ethnic groups of this vast, vast country.

31:40.510 --> 31:41.812
What is fun to make of this?

31:41.912 --> 31:44.796
Are we getting mixed signals here?

31:48.361 --> 31:53.087
Were there certain areas that were not allowed to be admittance into this?

31:54.288 --> 31:58.033
Did they just kind of not look the other way, I guess?

31:58.174 --> 32:03.801
I think that, well, Western Incunabula, for instance,

32:04.574 --> 32:15.410
Don't forget that the people that I'm talking about were part of the nomenclatura, of the absolutely upper levels of that society.

32:15.430 --> 32:17.013
So they were safe in a way.

32:17.093 --> 32:21.520
They were safe because they were perhaps had specialized knowledge.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.501
They were physicists.

32:22.521 --> 32:23.262
They were working.

32:23.302 --> 32:27.509
They could go about their business as long as you were not obtrusive.

32:28.510 --> 32:31.054
There were probably individuals who collected

32:32.047 --> 32:40.339
There were certainly people who collected before the revolution, salacious, what you might call polygraphic literature.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.983
Even during the Soviet period, I'm sure that there were such people.

32:43.804 --> 32:57.024
If you kept a low profile view, you went about your business quietly, you would be left, you know, left alone.

32:57.044 --> 33:01.851
You know, if you're Solzhenitsyn or something like that, you start causing trouble, then leave it at that point.

33:02.388 --> 33:19.863
Most of these people who were involved in the bibliophilic societies were people who were working in defined areas, had specialized knowledge, had independent means, one kind or another, and went about their business.

33:20.463 --> 33:32.293
So one could write, one could interview, one could write about such

33:33.573 --> 33:50.657
people in this overall context of a society where people did read and had access to a certain kind of learning.

33:51.558 --> 33:57.145
There were, of course, in libraries, restricted collections, the card catalogs were ten benches, and so on.

33:57.606 --> 34:03.394
But still, it was a society that put major emphasis

34:04.066 --> 34:10.913
on the book and on book culture, and that was very positive.

34:10.933 --> 34:32.115
And if you behaved and followed, you know, more or less the norms of that society, one could develop significant erudition, one could develop student had the means, you could develop a significant collection and go about your business.

34:33.293 --> 34:35.295
and you were relatively secure.

34:35.355 --> 34:39.200
Everyone had their particular niche.

34:40.442 --> 34:42.824
You had your template, your plan of work.

34:42.844 --> 34:50.434
If you worked in an institute, every five years you would have to submit what you were going to, what book you were going to be writing next month.

34:50.454 --> 35:01.647
That was approved, was subsidized, you know, and everything was in a kind of more or less working on some level.

35:03.027 --> 35:19.666
The difficulty was that this kind of environment could exist when you had no framework for comparison.

35:22.669 --> 35:31.920
And... This...

35:35.039 --> 36:03.966
When the telecommunications, the political and telecommunications revolution took place in Eastern Europe, and people began seeing their situation in a broader context, this was no longer enough, because people want medical treatment, they want proper

36:04.874 --> 36:11.741
They want proper food, they want proper travel privileges.

36:12.362 --> 36:17.167
Because all of these academics that were working, were working at deflated wages.

36:17.187 --> 36:19.509
They still are.

36:19.609 --> 36:20.310
But they were protected.

36:21.431 --> 36:29.059
And now, librarians and bibliographers are thinking, what, we have to become fundraisers?

36:29.731 --> 36:33.094
Where is the, where has the dough come?

36:33.174 --> 36:46.486
And is that kind of what he had a sense of at the dinner and Paul's, he expressed total amazement that Paul raises a half a million dollars a week.

36:46.566 --> 36:48.568
In fact, that's a little bit more than that.

36:48.588 --> 36:50.590
It's $600,000 a week.

36:50.610 --> 36:58.197
But, you know, all of a sudden he's in the position of nurturing benefactors.

36:58.217 --> 36:59.198
Very interesting, isn't it?

37:00.106 --> 37:11.177
and doesn't really understand, uh, or is, I wouldn't say doesn't really understand, he's groping towards another side.

37:11.197 --> 37:12.859
Yeah, and he's an old party guy, too.

37:13.820 --> 37:19.385
Now that's the sense I get, because this was a very prominent communist, uh, this gentleman.

37:19.586 --> 37:22.328
Not very prominent, but prominent enough.

37:22.348 --> 37:27.934
But, but certainly with a sense of survival, so to be able to, to attempt when, when times change.

37:27.954 --> 37:28.795
The transition.

37:28.815 --> 37:28.915
Yeah.

37:30.363 --> 37:40.257
And there you see the kind of dilemma that you had in this society.

37:42.761 --> 37:53.977
Very significant learning, very significant book culture, the study of the book, the cultivation of the book.

37:53.997 --> 37:57.602
But it was done in a hermetic environment.

38:00.552 --> 38:13.589
and was done with tremendous subsidy, where people were always kind of rubbing elbows.

38:13.629 --> 38:18.856
It was the same group of people.

38:22.200 --> 38:28.028
There were certain individuals like you who would write a book a year,

38:28.531 --> 38:33.458
Professor Nemirovsky, this great bookman still alive in Moscow, wrote a book a year.

38:34.119 --> 38:38.346
He was head of the rare books division at the Lennon Library.

38:38.386 --> 38:40.369
Professor Nemirovsky.

38:40.729 --> 38:41.831
Here's one of his books.

38:42.853 --> 38:49.583
Here's one of his books.

38:52.087 --> 38:53.489
Here's one of his books.

38:53.509 --> 38:55.652
The World of the Book.

38:57.792 --> 39:03.059
from earliest times to the beginning of the 20th century.

39:03.079 --> 39:09.428
And this is not a history just of the Russian book.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.652
No, I saw it with Zeta Stolt in the cover of the recent series.

39:12.692 --> 39:13.413
Exactly.

39:13.433 --> 39:16.477
This is a universal history of book culture.

39:16.497 --> 39:17.979
And you could do this.

39:17.999 --> 39:27.732
You would get probably a thousand new books as an honorary, you know, for this, some different stuff, as if he was going along swimmingly for a person like you.

39:28.167 --> 39:37.260
but in that hermetic environment.

39:37.280 --> 39:44.330
Well, for example, you would have... Here's a book on all these.

39:44.630 --> 39:46.213
Beautifully produced on Malnutrius.

39:46.273 --> 39:47.574
Look at that.

39:47.875 --> 39:49.697
Very well done.

39:49.838 --> 39:50.959
Lovely paper, nice vinyl.

39:50.979 --> 39:52.642
Yeah, exactly.

39:54.785 --> 39:56.487
And all of these people...

40:00.500 --> 40:15.155
would have to work controlling every word that they wrote and printed and also in their correspondence.

40:15.175 --> 40:19.179
I got a letter from him before the decline of the Soviet Union.

40:19.219 --> 40:20.000
From him in?

40:20.180 --> 40:20.841
Nimrodsky.

40:20.861 --> 40:21.061
Nimrodsky.

40:21.802 --> 40:29.950
When my little collection of essays came out in the early 80s, I specifically wrote on book people

40:31.145 --> 40:35.292
has fallen into political difficulty in Russia.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.195
Is it in Russian?

40:37.836 --> 40:39.699
No, my collection is in English.

40:39.719 --> 40:41.421
Is it something I'm going to be able to see?

40:41.742 --> 40:44.186
No, I'm going to give you a marked copy.

40:44.226 --> 40:45.909
I don't have any copies.

40:46.169 --> 40:47.531
Can I Xerox it?

40:49.154 --> 40:54.903
You don't mind if I put it in the machine?

40:55.103 --> 40:58.789
Not at all.

41:00.035 --> 41:17.641
I got a letter from him, a review, where he says, you know, I admire the fact that, you know, you seem to know something about the literature, but I absolutely cannot agree with you as to your political choices.

41:17.661 --> 41:19.003
Why did you... He said to you.

41:19.163 --> 41:27.896
Yeah, the focus on these people who generally had an antagonistic attitude towards my country.

41:28.297 --> 41:29.198
He had to write that.

41:29.701 --> 41:34.008
Because he felt that his letters would be read or something.

41:34.088 --> 41:36.713
It makes sense, but I can see it.

41:36.773 --> 41:40.238
What's his first name, by the way?

41:41.020 --> 41:41.160
Evgeny.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.462
Y-E-G-G-N-Y, right?

41:42.482 --> 41:55.303
I have... I wonder whether I kept my tip-in letters from refuse.

41:58.540 --> 42:00.803
I'm not sure how's he doing now.

42:08.671 --> 42:19.223
And I suppose doing... Oh, okay.

42:19.243 --> 42:25.690
Edward, to jump back to something we said earlier, and I'm going to use it because it was something very interesting.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.332
When we were talking, and you read

42:28.088 --> 42:52.662
summarized the thrust of this book and it was a looking backward kind of a procedure to make everyone part of the soviet empire right uh and obviously that failed didn't it i mean now that we found i mean you do have the reassertion of of of individual cultural and national senses of book culture and history and the whole

42:54.076 --> 43:02.526
Is there any way that what happened in Sarajevo could be worked into this as an example of anything?

43:02.546 --> 43:10.435
Because I have already done some work on, you know, the destruction of that library in one night, 1.2 million books.

43:11.076 --> 43:20.026
And you do have, you know, Muslims and Serbs and poets and all.

43:20.046 --> 43:23.070
Nick, let me respond in the following way.

43:24.282 --> 43:30.169
Actually, I did find this letter I folded into the book because it was a kind of classic.

43:30.189 --> 43:33.373
And I'll translate it for you.

43:35.936 --> 43:53.057
During the imperial period in Russia, and again, we're only focusing now on the East Slavs, and I want to continuously make that caveat.

43:53.510 --> 43:59.076
that we're talking about the Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians, and the Russian Empire.

43:59.737 --> 44:07.486
We're leaving out, for now, the South Slavs, we're not talking about the West Slavs, the Czechs, the Poles, and so on.

44:07.506 --> 44:14.373
We're not talking about the Baltic areas, we're not really talking about the Caucasus.

44:15.094 --> 44:22.302
The Russian Empire, if they would identify,

44:23.699 --> 44:30.567
a major document, a major book.

44:30.587 --> 44:38.095
In some part, there's some territory that they conquered and incorporated together.

44:38.115 --> 44:39.697
Let's say Poland.

44:39.717 --> 44:52.592
After the conquest of Poland, the 18th century, they would identify a particular library, the Zalewski library, whatever.

44:53.618 --> 44:56.564
That would be brought to the center.

44:56.584 --> 45:00.271
You'd have a great manuscript somewhere in Kiev.

45:00.291 --> 45:04.058
That would be brought to the center.

45:04.079 --> 45:04.419
The center being?

45:04.439 --> 45:04.820
Moscow, St.

45:04.840 --> 45:05.341
Petersburg.

45:05.361 --> 45:08.768
So Moscow, did that kind of supplant St.

45:09.189 --> 45:11.794
Petersburg during that period?

45:12.014 --> 45:16.082
Let me say that Moscow

45:17.598 --> 45:30.217
continued to be throughout the imperial period, even after the founding of St.

45:30.237 --> 45:31.199
Petersburg at the beginning of the 18th century.

45:31.219 --> 45:33.402
One of the Catholics, the phrase was always the two Catholics, Moscow and St.

45:33.422 --> 45:33.643
Petersburg.

45:33.663 --> 45:34.344
Moscow was the coronation capital.

45:35.906 --> 45:45.040
But they would always incorporate great treasures into central collections.

45:46.032 --> 45:48.895
the way the Romans did 2,000 years ago.

45:49.817 --> 45:50.537
Is that right?

45:50.598 --> 45:52.240
Is that a fair comparison?

45:52.840 --> 45:57.706
Many of us did it.

45:58.347 --> 46:14.166
But now the question becomes, these ethnic groups, whether you're Georgian, Armenian, whether you're Chechen, whether you're Uzbek, whether you're Kazakh,

46:15.361 --> 46:24.871
at various points in time, some of your treasures were brought to the center.

46:24.891 --> 46:30.016
This is particularly the case with Ukrainians, now an independent state, with 50 million people in Ukraine.

46:31.478 --> 46:34.741
And some of their greatest treasures are in St.

46:34.761 --> 46:40.047
Petersburg, and still in the Russian National Library.

46:40.067 --> 46:42.870
And during the Soviet period,

46:44.352 --> 46:48.378
It was possible.

46:48.398 --> 46:48.719
It was possible.

46:48.739 --> 46:50.742
Was it they petitioned to get any of these things back?

46:51.223 --> 46:52.385
That is going on.

46:53.607 --> 46:56.171
That is going on.

46:56.191 --> 46:58.034
I already wrote down that book.

46:58.875 --> 46:59.316
Right.

46:59.336 --> 47:02.020
You've seen it.

47:02.040 --> 47:05.486
This is the English-language version.

47:05.506 --> 47:09.432
But if you look into his manuscript department,

47:10.103 --> 47:16.109
you see some of the greatest treasures of the British culture.

47:16.129 --> 47:17.150
In there?

47:17.170 --> 47:33.044
And if I were the director of New Britain, I would begin a process of trying to readjust, to see whether some of these treasures... Do you think they have already made such inquiries?

47:33.805 --> 47:37.208
I have never spoken with Zaitsev

47:37.458 --> 47:39.300
or any other library director.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.983
That's a question for him, if I ever have an opportunity to say.

47:42.003 --> 47:42.804
Absolutely.

47:42.824 --> 47:53.935
How, for example, Chinese Popular Prince, write this book.

47:53.955 --> 47:56.377
Chinese Popular Prince.

47:56.398 --> 47:57.519
Okay.

47:57.539 --> 48:03.685
The reason that the Russians could write a book like this is that they had a mission

48:05.183 --> 48:16.477
in Peking that existed almost 300 years, so-called Peking Mission, to convert, you know, the Chinese to orthodoxy.

48:16.497 --> 48:34.920
When the heads of the missions were in residence, some of them were great scholars, the priests, they brought back cartloads of books

48:35.339 --> 48:39.945
manuscripts to the imperial capital.

48:39.965 --> 48:56.168
So you have, in Russia, but also in other Eastern European countries, and this is an important point that I think you want to think about.

48:57.589 --> 49:02.376
In all of these countries, you have vast collections

49:03.622 --> 49:11.330
of book cultures of other major world civilizations.

49:11.350 --> 49:22.682
So the French book in Russia, the Chinese book in Russia, the German book, the Italian book, and so on and so on.

49:22.702 --> 49:31.992
It's not only what these collections hold of their own native traditions, that's understood that they would have that, but what is

49:33.288 --> 49:48.808
Remarkable is that like the United States, which at the beginning of the 20th century, into the 20s, saw itself as the inheritor of European civilization, so you have people like Morgan going about buying goods.

49:49.149 --> 49:52.874
I mean, why should this man be concerned with the Gutenberg Bible?

49:52.894 --> 49:58.241
But he saw himself as the protector of European civilization here in America.

50:00.003 --> 50:02.907
And similarly, this empire,

50:05.570 --> 50:09.076
saw itself as a kind of gatherer.

50:09.096 --> 50:20.134
They had a mission in the Holy Land with Porfirio Spinsk in the 19th century, so he got the Codex of Aeticus, he brought it back to St.

50:20.154 --> 50:21.336
Petersburg.

50:21.356 --> 50:23.119
Is there anything written on this that I can read?

50:23.159 --> 50:30.852
I'm not sure that

50:31.675 --> 50:41.186
Yeah, I'm discreetly sure one could go through this and through our library and so on, one would find maybe individual articles on Russians as collectors or Eastern Europeans.

50:41.246 --> 50:47.293
But this sounds like a systematic policy of governmental collection.

50:47.514 --> 50:57.345
Yeah, of course, certainly beginning in the 18th and 19th century, the rulers and their grandees of the empire, they set about,

50:57.781 --> 51:00.364
Well, you said the empire saw itself as a gathering.

51:00.424 --> 51:03.046
You're going way back prior to the Soviet period.

51:03.066 --> 51:04.187
Prior to the Soviet period.

51:04.207 --> 51:08.011
So, actually, with Catherine the Great being, you know, a good place to start, probably.

51:09.273 --> 51:12.756
And again, as a storyteller, as a writer, you know, again, I'm looking for stories.

51:13.657 --> 51:17.141
You know, Paul's description of Voltaire's Library in St.

51:17.181 --> 51:21.705
Petersburg is a perfect little way almost to enter this, wouldn't you think?

51:22.366 --> 51:26.590
That's one way.

51:27.818 --> 51:56.492
One of the points I was trying to make is that when you consider these cultures, Eastern European cultures, realize that you're talking about civilizations that have materials and book cultures

51:58.295 --> 52:01.320
that are relevant to other civilizations.

52:01.500 --> 52:20.929
Russian explorers, for example, and I always keep going back to the Russians because it's the easiest example, but one could find analogous among Bohemians or Czechs who also at certain points in their history were very, you know, omnivorous in the 17th century and gathered all kinds of things.

52:20.949 --> 52:24.775
Well, the Swedes, I mean, they was... Of course.

52:24.795 --> 52:26.918
Did they plunder a...

52:27.404 --> 52:28.706
during the Thirty Years' War.

52:29.507 --> 52:35.314
But, and they have some of the great Slavic collections in, actually, in Uppsala.

52:36.336 --> 52:49.773
But you look at these civilizations and people don't realize how rich they are and how much they have of relevance to other cultures.

52:50.134 --> 52:56.382
Just recently, look at the number of articles that have been written in the New York Times on Hebraica.

52:56.648 --> 52:59.791
in Eastern Europe.

52:59.851 --> 53:01.673
Hebraic in Ukraine.

53:01.873 --> 53:03.755
Hebraic in Lithuania.

53:03.775 --> 53:05.917
Hebraic in Russia.

53:05.937 --> 53:07.719
Well, look at the Sarajevo-Hargada.

53:07.739 --> 53:13.104
That was the most prominent item that was saved during the whole attack.

53:13.425 --> 53:26.638
So, one, in discussing, and let me, one other thing that, and it ties into something I mentioned earlier, that when they

53:28.154 --> 53:43.331
when they dealt in Soviet historiography with the history of book culture, the emphasis always was on their own book culture.

53:43.351 --> 53:54.864
The fact that there were significant Western influences on Russian culture was often downplayed.

53:55.885 --> 53:57.587
They did not advertise

53:57.871 --> 54:03.317
the fact that they have great Hebraic collections, because it's a political issue.

54:03.817 --> 54:12.226
You don't want to emphasize Jewish culture, because this is a culture that is, in their view, a sectarian, in their view.

54:12.366 --> 54:15.349
Well, why didn't they sell it the way they sold you the other stuff?

54:17.551 --> 54:21.855
What kind of decisions were made on selling things for her parents?

54:21.915 --> 54:23.197
Okay, let me say the following.

54:23.497 --> 54:26.460
Maybe that's a naive question, but... I think that

54:29.393 --> 54:31.915
It could have come to that.

54:31.935 --> 54:34.418
It could have come to that.

54:35.659 --> 54:36.940
But it stopped short.

54:38.061 --> 54:41.024
It stopped short of it.

54:41.044 --> 54:58.320
Because if you had begun to sell large collections of Hebraica, the political ramifications of that

54:58.874 --> 55:03.100
would have probably been unmanageable.

55:03.841 --> 55:15.798
I think that people in the West, there are very significant and influential Jewish communities in the West.

55:15.818 --> 55:26.974
It would have raised questions about what else do you have?

55:26.994 --> 55:27.835
Let us have

55:28.473 --> 55:32.759
now access, now that you're selling it, that is getting to your archive.

55:32.779 --> 55:34.282
They did sell stuff though, I do think.

55:34.302 --> 55:52.228
They sold primarily Russian imperial material, books that had artifactual significance that you, you know, with plates and photographs, things that you could get money for.

55:52.248 --> 55:56.995
And relatively less

55:58.004 --> 56:00.828
of Western illuminated manuscripts.

56:00.848 --> 56:04.172
In other words, stuff that reflected their own prior history.

56:04.212 --> 56:09.519
Their own prior history, and a history that they were anxious to flush down.

56:09.539 --> 56:14.966
And which they were publicly abrogating, too.

56:15.086 --> 56:17.269
That's the critical one.

56:17.449 --> 56:26.661
The selling was a confirmation that we are politically abrogating the imperial regime.

56:27.063 --> 56:28.144
Take the garbage.

56:28.164 --> 56:29.025
Do what you want.

56:29.946 --> 56:32.009
You want to give us money for it, we're pleased to take it.

56:32.049 --> 56:32.549
All the best.

56:32.789 --> 56:35.553
We're not going to do it with Jewish material.

56:35.953 --> 56:37.274
Because we can get in trouble.

56:37.294 --> 56:39.897
We can get, it'll become unmanageable.

56:39.917 --> 56:41.940
And also it's a window into other things.

56:42.180 --> 56:45.083
Exactly, that we don't want discussed.

56:45.103 --> 56:49.408
It's almost like the Schliemann Gold, right?

56:50.620 --> 56:51.021
Right?

56:51.041 --> 56:53.685
Let's just keep that thing very... Exactly.

56:53.786 --> 56:55.168
And they just showed it when?

56:55.368 --> 56:55.889
Last year.

56:56.090 --> 56:59.917
It's the first time that they... Well, I mean, there had been an official mystery.

57:00.397 --> 57:01.159
What happened to it?

57:02.421 --> 57:09.253
And my feeling is that as time goes on, there will be other things that will be publicly owned up to.

57:09.273 --> 57:14.282
Now, I think that

57:16.810 --> 57:23.138
It's a very good point, by the way, since political stuff that is expendable and defensible to a political standpoint.

57:23.279 --> 57:45.889
Yeah, because the people, you know, who were in control of the government, they saw what could be controlled politically and what might get unraveled, what might become excessive of czarist furniture,

57:46.797 --> 57:56.406
furniture or various, you know, but they didn't sell the Impressionist paintings because they were not yet that desperate.

57:56.426 --> 58:07.216
They sold some old masters because that was big bucks, which they needed at a particular point in time, and then that stopped.

58:07.236 --> 58:15.184
It stopped like in the late 30s, and then stuff was resold

58:16.919 --> 58:21.404
that was already in the West.

58:21.424 --> 58:44.813
So, these sales took place at Gimbel's, Lord & Taylor's, at all the department stores and so on, here in New York, through Hammer, took place during about a 15-year period.

58:44.833 --> 58:45.694
And then it stopped

58:46.855 --> 58:51.562
And what appeared in The Post Worker was already in America.

58:52.944 --> 58:58.292
It was a reselling of stuff that was already here.

58:58.312 --> 59:08.668
Um... I think that... Does that change the trailer on?

59:11.032 --> 59:11.653
Yeah.

59:11.673 --> 59:12.354
Okay, good.

59:12.374 --> 59:15.799
It's an hour on each side, and it'll give us a little beep when it's ready to be...

59:16.403 --> 59:44.217
I think that it would be very good, would be very good, if in your next book you were able to take a part of the world, and it could be Eastern Europe, it could be the former Soviet Empire,

59:47.791 --> 01:00:17.207
and to try to convey some of the same notions that you've put forth in this book and deal

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:32.509
with the complexity of Eastern Europe.

01:00:35.492 --> 01:00:44.781
And Eastern Europe with all of its nuances, with all of these cultures that are represented there,

01:00:46.921 --> 01:00:52.847
number one number two to kind of give some sense of the tremendous
