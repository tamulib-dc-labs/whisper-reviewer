WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:04.055
Okay, we're talking to Scott Berg.

00:04.816 --> 00:05.717
Just forget that it's there.

00:05.797 --> 00:06.698
Okay.

00:06.718 --> 00:08.020
And congratulations.

00:08.040 --> 00:09.622
Thank you very much.

00:10.363 --> 00:26.702
You know, a book I wrote called The Gentle Madness that deals to a great extent with the special collections of university libraries, and clearly this is a book that's not possible without the special collections holdings at Yale.

00:26.882 --> 00:28.324
My book, yeah.

00:28.344 --> 00:28.624
Your book.

00:28.704 --> 00:30.426
That was the reason to do it.

00:31.351 --> 00:35.898
Because we have had writings about Lindbergh, we certainly have had writings by Lindbergh.

00:36.258 --> 00:38.362
Right.

00:40.264 --> 00:42.087
What is in these, what is it, 2000?

00:42.588 --> 00:44.371
Yeah, although they weren't all at Yale.

00:44.391 --> 00:50.279
There were about 500 plus of papers of Charles Lindbergh at Yale.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.586
Almost as much, again, of Anne Lindbergh at Yale.

00:54.606 --> 00:59.974
Several, about 100, I'd say, of photographs and other pictorial items.

01:00.730 --> 01:10.243
Then there were Morrow papers at, that is, Dwight Morrow's papers at Amherst, Anne's mother's papers, and sister's papers at Smith.

01:11.124 --> 01:20.697
Then there were papers at the Missouri Historical Society related to the flight, the childhood papers, and the grandfather and father's papers are in Minnesota.

01:21.337 --> 01:25.904
So they were all told about 2,000, a little more than 2,000 boxes, I think.

01:25.924 --> 01:27.345
And you went through pretty much everything?

01:27.365 --> 01:28.527
I went through everything.

01:28.928 --> 01:32.953
The only thing I didn't go through was, like, the complete papers of Dwight W. Morrow.

01:34.274 --> 01:36.056
You know, I went through the papers that applied.

01:36.276 --> 01:40.541
And we're talking about an ambassador here who must have an extraordinary archive of papers.

01:40.561 --> 01:41.402
Well, exactly.

01:41.422 --> 01:43.825
98% totally irrelevant to everything.

01:43.865 --> 01:45.087
Yeah, I mean, certainly to my work.

01:45.547 --> 01:52.095
But his personal papers, I certainly went through all of those.

01:52.215 --> 01:56.860
But the bulk of it, that core thousand boxes of...

01:57.059 --> 02:01.665
Oh, and then there was a crate at Princeton that had been sealed since the 30s, actually.

02:01.685 --> 02:01.865
Really?

02:01.986 --> 02:05.010
The Lindberghs had given it to Princeton and just sort of forgotten about it.

02:05.030 --> 02:05.570
And what was it?

02:05.991 --> 02:16.385
And it turned out to be some interesting papers from that period, just a bunch of papers that just escaped somehow, but they crated up one day when they closed their house.

02:16.405 --> 02:22.493
Now, when you enter—this is your third big biography—and when you go into something like this,

02:23.114 --> 02:24.937
Do you expect that it's going to take a decade?

02:25.197 --> 02:26.139
This I did, actually.

02:26.159 --> 02:42.966
And in fact, when I met Mrs. Lindbergh to press my case, I remember one of my selling points was, oh, Mrs. Lindbergh, unlike so many biographers who come to you and want to do a book in a year or two, I will give this seven to ten years if it takes that.

02:43.006 --> 02:44.869
And I remember she leaned over

02:45.288 --> 02:47.712
And she said, oh, do you think you could do it in just 10 years?

02:47.853 --> 02:49.756
And I said, oh, I'll try.

02:49.776 --> 02:52.180
If it takes more, if it takes 20, I'll take 20.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.044
What do you think she wanted out of this?

02:56.428 --> 03:00.936
I think she wanted a fair and honest biography.

03:01.076 --> 03:02.198
I honestly do mean that.

03:02.218 --> 03:06.165
Given what we know about their relationship, it's certainly...

03:07.124 --> 03:10.128
There were appearances and there's reality.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.272
And I have to believe she understood that you would be getting there.

03:13.453 --> 03:14.174
I know she did.

03:14.414 --> 03:15.075
I know she did.

03:15.115 --> 03:26.671
And at the same time, I think, I honestly felt when she let me do it, and I think this was the really good timing on my part, I think she felt she would not be alive to read the book.

03:26.751 --> 03:28.053
She was 82 when I met her.

03:28.093 --> 03:28.774
She is alive.

03:28.814 --> 03:29.715
She's 92 now.

03:29.735 --> 03:31.197
I don't think she can read the book.

03:31.317 --> 03:36.304
She's straying mentally.

03:37.229 --> 03:38.871
But I think that was a factor.

03:39.612 --> 03:40.213
I think that was a factor.

03:40.233 --> 03:43.717
And we also have Reeves' book coming out simultaneously.

03:43.737 --> 03:45.680
Is this a coincidental thing, do you think?

03:46.881 --> 03:54.391
Because I noticed they're being reviewed together in a number of places, which is either fortunate or unfortunate, depending on how you look at it.

03:54.411 --> 03:55.793
Yeah.

03:55.993 --> 03:59.798
I think, I believe, that was her publisher's.

04:00.359 --> 04:00.819
Makes sense.

04:00.839 --> 04:04.084
The book was not meant to come out until next spring, her book.

04:04.104 --> 04:05.245
And suddenly there it was.

04:05.596 --> 04:18.072
And there they are being... Yes, and I noticed in their... Somebody sent me a copy, or Reed sent me a copy of The Galleys, and I noticed in their galleys they said, timed to be published with Scott Reed.

04:18.092 --> 04:18.873
That makes sense.

04:20.455 --> 04:25.682
Yeah, although I felt they shortchanged her in a bit, in that I think her book stands on its own.

04:25.702 --> 04:26.884
And they're quite different books.

04:26.904 --> 04:31.430
It does, and actually they certainly can be read alongside each other.

04:31.470 --> 04:31.750
Yeah.

04:31.810 --> 04:33.072
But yours is really...

04:33.693 --> 04:37.237
a scholarly, detailed... Yeah, mine's the whole story.

04:37.297 --> 04:39.119
Hers is a memoir.

04:39.139 --> 04:44.424
And the work of a professional biographer, and this is the account of a child.

04:44.704 --> 04:46.526
Yeah, exactly, more or less.

04:47.007 --> 04:55.335
I just thought they shortchanged her in that I thought if my book came out and did well, it would just create more interest in Lindbergh.

04:55.355 --> 05:03.143
And if hers came out next spring, well... But it is interesting that hers, and I haven't had a chance to look at her, I haven't.

05:04.135 --> 05:05.777
In my piece, I'll probably give it a line.

05:05.858 --> 05:07.340
I mean, I doubt if I'll give it more than that.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.925
I mean, all you read is that piece of consumer information.

05:10.945 --> 05:11.967
Absolutely.

05:11.987 --> 05:13.028
And she's a very good writer.

05:13.128 --> 05:13.529
Yeah.

05:13.549 --> 05:13.849
She is.

05:14.070 --> 05:17.475
She's a wonderful... Actually, they're a very bright and capable family.

05:17.495 --> 05:18.035
And literary.

05:18.596 --> 05:24.545
And, you know, going back to Charles Lindbergh, he's a wonderful... As you point out, he's a wonderful writer.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.306
He really is.

05:25.486 --> 05:26.268
The Spirit of St.

05:26.288 --> 05:27.890
Louis deserves the Pulitzer Prize.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.831
It is a thrilling book.

05:29.132 --> 05:32.016
And, you know, the rap against that people were saying...

05:32.435 --> 05:34.357
sneering that he couldn't have written it.

05:34.377 --> 05:35.218
Maybe his wife wrote it.

05:35.258 --> 05:35.858
Yes, exactly.

05:35.958 --> 05:43.305
And if you read anything that Anne Morrow Limburg wrote, the tense structure and everything that he used was decidedly his.

05:43.586 --> 05:44.266
Totally his.

05:44.807 --> 05:45.327
Absolutely.

05:45.488 --> 05:52.214
So you don't necessarily agree with the woman who said if it weren't for the flight, he'd be a gas jockey.

05:52.274 --> 05:53.015
Indeed not.

05:53.455 --> 05:55.577
And she did come around, that woman, I should say.

05:55.838 --> 05:59.421
And in fact, I think I have enough footnote in the back that she came around.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.301
No, I don't agree at all.

06:02.202 --> 06:05.926
Because I think he had a constantly curious mind.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.569
He really had vast interests.

06:08.709 --> 06:16.917
And when you look at the work with Goddard and archaeology and anthropology and the medical stuff with Dr. Carell, this was a very restless thinker.

06:17.538 --> 06:25.486
You know, because we certainly do perceive of him as an American hero, and there certainly are heroic qualities.

06:25.906 --> 06:28.429
And to look at it in the classical sense,

06:29.236 --> 06:34.441
Like all tragic heroes, or classical heroes, there has to be a fatal flaw.

06:34.822 --> 06:40.107
And I'm wondering if you feel that he has one, and if so, what is his flaw?

06:40.127 --> 06:41.429
What is his character flaw?

06:41.449 --> 06:45.853
Yeah, it might be a form of hubris, in fact.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.898
I mean, it's that stubbornness.

06:51.299 --> 06:55.223
As one of the daughters says, there were two ways of doing things, father's way and the wrong way.

06:55.984 --> 06:59.007
And I think that.

06:59.459 --> 07:03.906
retracting anything, never recanting, never taking anything back.

07:04.347 --> 07:10.196
And there's something admirable about somebody, I think, who stands by his record, which he always did.

07:10.216 --> 07:11.819
He always took full responsibility.

07:12.480 --> 07:19.411
On the other hand, I mean, the German stuff, for example, and in later years recanted and said we were naive or wrong or we didn't know.

07:19.892 --> 07:20.633
Charles never did.

07:21.615 --> 07:22.196
You're Jewish.

07:22.737 --> 07:23.678
Coming into this,

07:25.092 --> 07:28.696
What did you hope to find, a vindication or a smoking gun?

07:29.136 --> 07:34.241
Well, you know, honestly, I hoped to find, I really did hope to find the truth.

07:34.381 --> 07:46.253
I really, because it had been, I had grown up with all the prejudice, all the Jewish prejudices against Lindbergh, which were that Lindbergh was prejudiced against Jews.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.136
So I just wanted to see, was he really that terrible?

07:49.156 --> 07:50.677
And if so, how did he get that way?

07:50.957 --> 07:53.580
And if he wasn't, well, let's put that out there, too.

07:54.033 --> 07:56.095
So I found a little more and a little less.

07:56.696 --> 08:00.561
I mean, I found that he was less anti-Semitic than I had been raised.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.802
He wasn't a Jew hater.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.644
He wasn't a Jew baiter, really.

08:04.445 --> 08:12.174
On the other hand, there in black and white were these sentiments about Jews that did get cut from the published diaries.

08:13.075 --> 08:13.856
And that was pretty shocking.

08:13.876 --> 08:16.079
I'm kind of surprised at Bill Jovanovich.

08:16.639 --> 08:19.062
I was, too, to be perfectly honest with you.

08:19.615 --> 08:26.915
I know people that have worked with him, and I would have thought that he would have been a little bit more professional.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.024
Professional integrity?

08:30.165 --> 08:33.895
I won't use that in my piece, but I think I expected more.

08:34.077 --> 08:36.701
This is sugarcoating history.

08:36.721 --> 08:40.266
Yeah, I think they figured, well, let's not open the whole can of worms again.

08:40.426 --> 08:43.511
But on the other hand, then why write that introduction saying we changed nothing?

08:43.651 --> 08:43.891
Exactly.

08:43.971 --> 08:47.236
And then the paperwork is there for Scott Berg to come along and find it.

08:47.637 --> 08:48.338
I know.

08:48.939 --> 08:50.961
Yeah, at least destroy the pages.

08:51.001 --> 08:52.724
Yeah, I mean, at some point we're going to see this stuff.

08:52.944 --> 08:53.665
Absolutely.

08:53.685 --> 08:55.969
And in this case, sooner rather than later.

08:56.209 --> 08:56.790
Absolutely.

08:57.090 --> 08:58.793
Now, that was a surprise to me.

08:58.813 --> 09:00.355
Yeah.

09:00.672 --> 09:05.340
But to get back to your earlier question, it was rather shocking to me when I would come across these things.

09:05.420 --> 09:14.795
Did you feel, I know Michiko loved your book, and I don't quote other reviews, but she kind of wishes that you had drawn a few more conclusions.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.880
How do you respond to that?

09:17.980 --> 09:26.815
Well, to that charge, what she was basically finding fault with, that to me was something I

09:27.031 --> 09:33.918
I pride myself on in the book, that I basically, and that I had no psychological interpretation.

09:33.938 --> 09:36.120
I hate psycho biology.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.201
Well, I eschew that.

09:37.401 --> 09:38.782
So do I. It makes me crazy.

09:38.802 --> 09:44.528
And my point is, I'll serve up all the material for you, and if you want to do this psychoanalysis, go ahead.

09:44.728 --> 09:47.250
And here's the box number of Yale if you want to go look at the stuff.

09:47.270 --> 09:48.531
Yeah, if you want even more.

09:48.652 --> 09:50.573
Yeah, but I'll present you all the facts you need.

09:51.054 --> 09:51.774
So there it is.

09:51.815 --> 09:53.376
But I am not going to be the one...

09:53.744 --> 09:54.885
Because, well, I don't know.

09:54.905 --> 09:55.706
You're not qualified.

09:55.946 --> 09:56.667
Not qualified.

09:56.727 --> 09:57.728
I did an interview with a woman.

09:57.748 --> 09:59.009
Who said that's the answer anyway?

09:59.029 --> 10:07.678
A psychotherapist, a psychoanalyst, a psychiatrist in Belgium, who just wrote a delightful biography of Casanova.

10:08.019 --> 10:09.861
You know, if anyone has ever... Yeah, really.

10:10.721 --> 10:11.102
Right.

10:11.122 --> 10:15.646
But she didn't, you know, and she said, you know, he didn't ask me to be his... Yeah, that's right.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.110
He didn't invite me to be his shrink, and I don't have all the facts.

10:19.130 --> 10:22.013
And, you know, so I don't feel that I have the...

10:22.398 --> 10:22.979
right to do.

10:22.999 --> 10:25.741
And this is a trained clinical psychoanalyst.

10:25.761 --> 10:30.445
And I was going to say, in a Freudian might disagree with a Jungian interpretation or an Adlerian.

10:30.465 --> 10:30.986
Who wants that?

10:31.066 --> 10:33.148
Anyway, you're a biographer.

10:33.428 --> 10:33.888
Absolutely.

10:33.908 --> 10:35.089
You're telling me about the life.

10:35.470 --> 10:39.373
And, you know, it is, who is it that said this to me?

10:39.393 --> 10:40.094
David McCullough.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.835
Yeah.

10:41.855 --> 10:48.301
You know, he said, when you're writing about a person, when you decide, choosing the subject is the hardest thing for a biographer, number one.

10:48.601 --> 10:49.162
Correct.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.544
When he was talking about why he might do

10:52.537 --> 10:54.899
and he ultimately didn't, was a U.S.

10:54.939 --> 10:58.602
grant or Teddy Roosevelt when he was talking about the Panama Canal.

10:59.103 --> 11:09.873
He said, the amazing thing is when you read their own memoirs, when you read what they write about themselves, it's more important to see what they don't say about themselves than what they do say about themselves.

11:09.893 --> 11:13.956
And here we have Lindbergh, Pulitzer Prize winning writer, half a dozen books.

11:14.056 --> 11:15.357
Yeah, all autobiographical.

11:15.417 --> 11:16.438
All autobiographical.

11:16.819 --> 11:20.502
What is it that Lindbergh didn't say about himself that...

11:20.617 --> 11:25.765
I love this question, and I love David McCullough for saying that too, because that's the thing.

11:25.785 --> 11:26.226
That's it, yeah.

11:26.246 --> 11:35.380
Because the childhood, what little he writes about his childhood, and this is the answer, the childhood, what little he writes is sort of Huck Finn.

11:36.041 --> 11:39.025
And there we were rafting on the upper Mississippi and blah, blah, blah.

11:39.346 --> 11:45.375
And in fact, it was a terrible, really unhappy childhood, most of which was spent away from the upper Mississippi.

11:46.013 --> 11:50.178
And there is that telling line where he says, I really don't remember my childhood.

11:50.198 --> 11:58.388
Well, that in and of itself... That's the most amazing statement when you come right down on it.

11:58.488 --> 12:01.672
I couldn't believe he actually wrote it and didn't realize what that meant.

12:02.113 --> 12:07.379
And I didn't realize that his mother came and camped in with him, a la Douglas MacArthur.

12:08.160 --> 12:13.167
There are a number of really very important people in history whose mothers came to live with them.

12:13.187 --> 12:14.308
Absolutely.

12:14.428 --> 12:15.109
Absolutely.

12:15.410 --> 12:18.496
Well, I love Charles Lindbergh going off to college, and there's a mother.

12:18.756 --> 12:19.537
That's what I mean.

12:19.557 --> 12:22.242
Well, didn't Doug MacArthur's mother move to West Point?

12:22.463 --> 12:22.943
Yeah.

12:22.964 --> 12:23.665
Oh, yeah, right.

12:23.685 --> 12:31.499
And there are another really, a couple of other really extraordinary examples where a mother went along.

12:31.619 --> 12:34.324
And there's a mother who used to shake hands goodnight with him.

12:34.344 --> 12:34.785
Yeah, really.

12:35.065 --> 12:36.227
I mean, that was strange.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.249
So it's this odd thing.

12:37.718 --> 12:46.976
You know, I have a pilot's license, but I haven't flown in years, but I have a great passion for aviation.

12:46.996 --> 12:52.386
And, you know, to me, Charles Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic

12:52.670 --> 12:56.355
and coming within a half a degree of his kind of dead reckoning landfall.

12:56.456 --> 12:57.417
Yes, exactly.

12:57.437 --> 12:58.258
It's insane.

12:58.318 --> 12:59.941
You can say anything you want.

12:59.961 --> 13:02.184
Mark McGuire can hit 70, but he ain't gave proof.

13:02.364 --> 13:02.965
That's right.

13:03.246 --> 13:03.967
That's right.

13:04.187 --> 13:04.748
That's right.

13:04.968 --> 13:10.056
And whatever people say about Lindbergh, that is still... It's still fundamentally there.

13:10.076 --> 13:14.322
...an extraordinary achievement that can only happen once.

13:14.662 --> 13:20.731
And what I'd also say to that as well is it was a death-defying deed, too.

13:21.072 --> 13:21.192
Right.

13:21.391 --> 13:22.793
Forget the technical aspects.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.796
The man did put his life on the line.

13:25.277 --> 13:31.586
He also very soberly looked at the hazards.

13:31.606 --> 13:34.049
He weighed the hazards against, the risks against.

13:34.850 --> 13:35.752
I think, what did he say?

13:37.194 --> 13:39.217
One or two seasons flying the mail at night.

13:39.237 --> 13:39.858
Yes, exactly.

13:40.178 --> 13:41.099
It can't be anymore.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.481
It can't be worse than this.

13:42.662 --> 13:43.403
It can't be worse than this.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.184
Yeah, exactly.

13:45.165 --> 13:49.812
And with what you were saying, too, he resented...

13:50.483 --> 13:51.805
the nickname Lucky Lindy.

13:52.106 --> 13:52.666
That's right.

13:52.686 --> 13:55.250
Because this whole thing was, luck was the least elementary.

13:55.270 --> 14:06.608
There was always some luck, but... Sometimes I'm looking at all these, when I'm having these conversations, I never like to leave, and I'm not done by any means, but you never like to leave until you have the lead, and also the kicker.

14:06.688 --> 14:08.871
I've got the lead now, I think.

14:10.133 --> 14:14.500
You know, the name he found abhorrent was Lucky, Lucky Lindy.

14:14.851 --> 14:19.056
I mean, he left as little to chance as was humanly possible.

14:19.076 --> 14:22.720
You know, if he were meeting at Earhart, that trip would have been on the button.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.722
He'd have made every landfall that he was supposed to.

14:24.743 --> 14:26.084
He was a great navigator.

14:26.445 --> 14:27.005
Yeah.

14:28.827 --> 14:33.433
He was in control of his machine and his human machine.

14:33.613 --> 14:33.873
That's right.

14:33.893 --> 14:34.113
Yeah.

14:34.614 --> 14:35.035
Amazing.

14:36.476 --> 14:40.901
So how do you emerge from this project?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.343
I mean, you must certainly have your own

14:42.796 --> 14:44.698
My feelings about him?

14:44.758 --> 14:46.780
About him, yeah.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.165
They're mixed, but on the whole, they're admirable.

14:51.305 --> 14:53.247
I mean, they're admiring that.

14:53.287 --> 14:54.228
Really?

14:54.248 --> 15:01.295
Yeah, because, well, partly for what you said, first of all, at the basis of this life is that incredible deed.

15:02.196 --> 15:03.157
But it wouldn't be all that.

15:03.317 --> 15:06.601
Beyond that, the human aspect, I think.

15:06.641 --> 15:10.845
I mean, I've taken life lessons from him now, which is...

15:11.213 --> 15:14.678
how you live your life and what you do with it and how much you pack into it.

15:15.258 --> 15:16.340
And it's an approach.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.942
It's an energy level.

15:18.142 --> 15:20.025
It's about purpose.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.687
And that's what I admire about him.

15:21.707 --> 15:27.594
Even when he was wrong, and he was wrong and sometimes stupid and sometimes offensive.

15:27.615 --> 15:31.279
But all that being said, he made something of his life.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.382
And it wasn't for personal gain.

15:33.402 --> 15:34.664
It wasn't for power.

15:35.024 --> 15:35.825
It wasn't for money.

15:36.967 --> 15:40.191
It was to leave the world a better place, I think.

15:40.829 --> 15:48.218
You know, it's also very interesting is that you do get into the Hauptmann matter to a considerable extent.

15:48.618 --> 16:02.075
And you also come out and say that for all the circus atmosphere and the horrible ways in which this thing was handled, they still probably got the right guy.

16:02.095 --> 16:02.655
I think that.

16:02.876 --> 16:07.461
Yeah, I think after all is said and done, actually my feeling about the

16:08.234 --> 16:12.880
the kidnapping and trial after all said and done are two things.

16:15.303 --> 16:23.293
One is what we tend to lose sight of is that a baby died here.

16:23.773 --> 16:27.618
You know, we get all caught up in the conspiracies and maybe the maid did it and blah blah blah.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.159
But you know what?

16:28.219 --> 16:29.060
A baby died.

16:29.821 --> 16:34.647
And the parents of that baby were 25 years old and 30 years old.

16:35.032 --> 16:36.313
That's just hard.

16:36.854 --> 16:37.675
That's the first thing.

16:37.715 --> 16:41.358
The second thing, and I was writing those chapters during the O.J.

16:41.439 --> 16:41.799
trial.

16:41.899 --> 16:42.199
Really?

16:42.620 --> 16:48.406
Yeah, it was so ironic, is there was a mountain of evidence against this guy.

16:49.347 --> 16:51.109
I do believe he got an unfair trial.

16:51.269 --> 17:04.262
I do believe there was sloppy police work, that witnesses lied, media hysteria, all that, and yet there's still a mountain of indisputable evidence against this man.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.094
Well, that's reassuring.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.176
Yeah, I felt that too.

17:08.196 --> 17:10.559
It's not an enduring mystery as to— Not to me.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.280
Well, I mean, especially the money and the ladder.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.683
The money, the ladder, and the handwriting to me.

17:14.743 --> 17:15.664
And the handwriting, yeah.

17:16.104 --> 17:18.006
It's just so indisputable.

17:18.586 --> 17:20.268
It's the DNA of its time, isn't it?

17:20.288 --> 17:20.969
Yeah, well, it was.

17:21.029 --> 17:21.549
It truly was.

17:21.589 --> 17:24.833
And that wood expert, when he got up there, he was dazzling.

17:25.954 --> 17:31.879
So you must—did you find, in a project like this—I guess you did have the luxury of time, didn't you?

17:31.899 --> 17:32.460
You're young.

17:32.896 --> 17:33.356
Yeah.

17:33.497 --> 17:35.238
Oh, I definitely had a luxury of time on this.

17:35.258 --> 17:35.659
Yeah.

17:35.679 --> 17:43.506
And so you could indulge yourself in taking an extended excursion off to the left or to the right.

17:43.606 --> 17:44.127
Absolutely.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.068
And really get into that.

17:45.168 --> 17:46.109
And I did.

17:46.129 --> 17:48.952
And you're saying, geez, maybe I'm spending too much time on this trial.

17:49.292 --> 17:50.333
I've got to get back on track.

17:50.353 --> 17:51.334
No, I never had that.

17:52.195 --> 17:59.021
And in fact, just this whole project, I remember thinking it was the right moment in my life.

17:59.522 --> 18:02.785
Because I thought if I were a little younger, I'm not sure...

18:03.052 --> 18:06.516
I would have had the maturity, the emotional gravity.

18:07.017 --> 18:10.821
And if I were a little older, I'm not sure I would have had the energy to go to all the places I went.

18:10.882 --> 18:11.142
Really?

18:11.522 --> 18:18.771
Yeah, you know, to visit Sweden, and visit Hawaii, and visit France, and just to get to move to New Haven for two years.

18:19.092 --> 18:28.663
You feel, as I do, that as good as material is, documents, and they're essential, you still have to go out and see the place.

18:28.703 --> 18:30.105
You do, you really do.

18:30.659 --> 18:32.462
And smell the air.

18:32.822 --> 18:34.384
I couldn't agree more with you.

18:34.404 --> 18:43.678
You know, the day I went to this little island off the coast of Hilton, Iliad, and I mean, it's the size of this roof, with one house on it.

18:44.619 --> 18:52.731
And boy, standing there, and the wind was whipping up, and the clouds were going, and I thought, I get Charles Lindbergh.

18:52.751 --> 18:53.732
Of course he came here.

18:54.273 --> 18:54.473
Of course.

18:54.976 --> 18:57.119
And how old were you when you started this project?

18:57.880 --> 18:59.503
How old do you start with, how old do I now?

18:59.523 --> 19:07.235
Well, I'm 48, so I started in, I technically started in March of 90.

19:07.435 --> 19:09.979
No, that's fine.

19:10.039 --> 19:11.381
I was just 40.

19:11.521 --> 19:12.363
I can't figure that out.

19:12.423 --> 19:13.845
I was 40 when I started.

19:14.045 --> 19:16.749
This could not have been a first biography for you.

19:16.809 --> 19:19.593
Do you think you had to go with Perkins to go to Lindbergh?

19:19.613 --> 19:19.794
No doubt.

19:19.834 --> 19:20.134
Oh, no doubt.

19:20.174 --> 19:21.837
At least somebody before this.

19:21.977 --> 19:23.159
I couldn't have broken in on this.

19:23.179 --> 19:28.286
So what did you learn from those prior projects that were brought to bear?

19:28.346 --> 19:29.167
Well, I think two things.

19:29.248 --> 19:38.501
First, I learned research skills, which really I needed to tackle this.

19:38.521 --> 19:41.065
I mean, I had more material.

19:42.378 --> 19:51.791
I had as much material for the America First chapter and one other chapter on Lindbergh, as much for that as I did on all of Max Bergman.

19:51.811 --> 19:51.992
Wow.

19:53.554 --> 19:54.976
I mean, in notes and all that.

19:55.036 --> 20:00.864
So just to have the ability to find it and all that.

20:00.884 --> 20:07.233
And I think the second thing beyond the research is I think my writing skills have honed.

20:07.253 --> 20:10.478
Yeah, I think they've definitely improved.

20:10.998 --> 20:18.710
And again, what Lindenberg brought to the project, because he was so precise, I really felt him looking over my shoulder all the time.

20:19.171 --> 20:24.900
And I can't tell you how many sentences I would write, and then I'd hear a voice saying, that's not exactly right.

20:25.340 --> 20:28.044
You know, go back and, no, that word is just wrong.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.148
I'm not really an isolationist.

20:30.328 --> 20:31.910
I'm an anti-interventionist.

20:32.051 --> 20:35.296
You weren't dancing with words either, you know, I think.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.739
I mean, these weren't euphemisms at his part.

20:37.759 --> 20:39.402
They were his take on...

20:39.702 --> 20:40.683
Very precise.

20:40.904 --> 20:42.005
Absolutely.

20:42.286 --> 20:43.467
He did have clarity.

20:43.888 --> 20:45.050
There was no question about that.

20:45.270 --> 20:47.213
He was often wrong, but he was always clear.

20:47.874 --> 20:48.434
It's amazing.

20:48.695 --> 20:49.095
It's amazing.

20:49.176 --> 20:52.580
And I don't know, I was talking to David McCullough again recently.

20:53.281 --> 20:53.822
Lucky you.

20:55.525 --> 20:55.845
Excuse me.

20:55.865 --> 20:59.671
I don't know if you get allergies out in California.

20:59.711 --> 21:00.432
Yeah.

21:00.472 --> 21:01.794
I hear the mold is bad today.

21:02.034 --> 21:02.555
It's terrible.

21:02.755 --> 21:04.077
I took my pills and all that.

21:04.377 --> 21:06.300
Anyway.

21:06.685 --> 21:09.869
He enjoyed my book, and he said to me, now you've got to do a biography.

21:10.189 --> 21:13.913
He said, next project, I said, well, after the next one.

21:13.933 --> 21:23.664
But biography, look at how he went, Path Between the Seas, The Brooklyn Bridge, terrific books.

21:23.684 --> 21:25.686
But then he felt now's the time to do a life.

21:25.786 --> 21:29.190
That is, I think, for nonfiction writers, the challenge, isn't it?

21:29.210 --> 21:31.613
I think it is, because you're doing...

21:32.183 --> 21:33.945
You're doing it from the outside and the inside, in a way.

21:33.965 --> 21:38.449
I mean, you're doing the big story, the panorama shot, but then you're doing the close-ups.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.571
And you have to make this a real person.

21:40.611 --> 21:51.602
You're trying to put together a structure, put flesh on the bones of a consequential human being.

21:51.663 --> 21:54.525
Not just a human being, but one of great consequences.

21:54.625 --> 21:55.807
And that's what takes all the time.

21:55.887 --> 21:59.170
It's not just reading through the documents.

21:59.504 --> 22:07.773
I guess the question is, does the individual become a person to you?

22:07.793 --> 22:12.297
At some point, do we go beyond the documents, the material?

22:12.718 --> 22:13.599
Yes.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.923
Well, the quintessence, the fifth essence does take over.

22:17.943 --> 22:19.045
Yeah, I think so.

22:19.525 --> 22:21.047
At what point does that happen?

22:21.067 --> 22:22.128
Does that happen in the research?

22:22.148 --> 22:26.432
You're talking about this critical mass of material that you had for the first chapter and a half.

22:26.452 --> 22:28.134
Do you say at some point, I'm ready now?

22:28.554 --> 22:29.055
Yes.

22:29.238 --> 22:39.670
There are, well, along the way, at least as I do, I'll talk about me in general, but as I go along, there are epiphanies, there's no doubt about it.

22:39.730 --> 22:43.875
And you do hit moments either in papers or, again, walking around Iliac.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.679
Places I got a lot, I had several of them.

22:46.939 --> 22:50.503
When I saw his childhood house, when I saw the grave,

22:50.737 --> 22:56.043
But this is apart from the research, so this is that physical moment.

22:56.143 --> 22:57.244
Talk to me about the epiphanies.

22:57.305 --> 22:58.226
I love epiphanies.

22:58.246 --> 23:02.210
They're a wonderful moment.

23:02.811 --> 23:05.955
Well, do you want the travelogue epiphanies?

23:06.415 --> 23:10.179
Yeah, actually, I like a couple of each.

23:11.100 --> 23:16.326
I remember, well, certainly the six or seven great sights I saw.

23:16.367 --> 23:20.271
When I saw the childhood house in Little Falls, Minnesota,

23:21.145 --> 23:30.499
and went upstairs to the little attic where he used to collect his tin soldiers and things like that.

23:31.420 --> 23:43.157
And I didn't see the house until after I had been through the papers and seen his list of his collections, his cigar band collection, his tin soldier collections.

23:43.478 --> 23:45.060
And when I finally saw this little

23:45.361 --> 23:47.844
attic where he did all this.

23:47.864 --> 23:48.665
That was a jolt.

23:49.246 --> 23:56.836
When I saw Iliak and felt the wind and all that, that was a jolt, because it was like Wuthering Heights in the middle of the water.

23:57.817 --> 24:05.648
And again, I'll give you a third that'll... I like those two.

24:05.828 --> 24:13.478
But also, all the places I visited, and well, I must say, in the Kidnap House, too, walking through the Kidnap House in New Jersey.

24:14.015 --> 24:21.663
I had that feeling, too, because it was also a very windy day when I went, as it had been a windy night when the kidnapping occurred.

24:22.143 --> 24:27.148
But what all the sites had in common also was isolation.

24:27.168 --> 24:34.836
They were all down country roads that are hard to find, and then down mile-long driveways.

24:34.896 --> 24:37.438
I mean, they're really isolated places.

24:38.359 --> 24:40.602
You really do get something from the site, don't you?

24:40.642 --> 24:44.005
I just wrote a chapter in my new book on Monte Cassino, and I really went there.

24:44.322 --> 24:52.133
last year just to visit the cell where Benedict did this rule, you know, which preserved the class.

24:52.153 --> 24:53.074
That's correct.

24:53.154 --> 24:54.176
Why do you have to go there?

24:54.216 --> 24:55.298
You can get pictures of it.

24:55.758 --> 24:56.259
Yeah, you can.

24:56.279 --> 25:09.598
I'm writing this scene, and of course now I'm writing about the destruction of the Abbey and how the manuscript, having been there, having felt that, looking out of that, 1,700 feet above the valley, and you feel that wind.

25:09.738 --> 25:10.599
Yeah.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.642
It's all part of it.

25:12.790 --> 25:30.378
In fact, I'll give you another moment, which is I knew, as I was going through the papers and just starting to put it together in my head, the flight chapter, because Lindbergh had written about it so well, I knew I was somehow going to have to make that special, or at least write it very well.

25:31.841 --> 25:37.009
But it occurred to me that what the chapter was really about was sleep, that here was a man who wanted to go to sleep.

25:37.377 --> 25:38.338
He was desperate for sleep.

25:38.358 --> 25:38.839
Yes.

25:38.979 --> 25:43.183
And I knew the chapter was going to start with that because he had been up for 23 hours.

25:43.563 --> 25:47.467
All he wants to do is go to sleep so he can get a nap in before he does the great flight.

25:47.668 --> 25:48.789
And he doesn't get the nap.

25:49.610 --> 25:55.556
So I knew I wanted that chapter to end not with his landing in Paris, but with his finally getting to go to sleep.

25:56.577 --> 26:03.184
So that's why I decided I will go to Paris and I want to see the bed that he spent the night in.

26:03.584 --> 26:06.287
And that was a great moment for me too, to see the bed.

26:06.487 --> 26:07.288
That's great.

26:07.308 --> 26:07.648
I love this.

26:07.668 --> 26:12.113
Yeah, and the woman who took me through the ambassador's residence, Pamela Harriman, let me in.

26:12.293 --> 26:16.437
She was the ambassador, but then somebody who worked there let me in.

26:16.457 --> 26:26.767
And at one point I asked her to go get me a photograph of something, and then I lay down on the bed, just to get a sense of the bed, which was so narrow and so small.

26:26.787 --> 26:31.432
I mean, Lindbergh was taller than I am, and I felt cramped in this little bed.

26:32.053 --> 26:32.673
So important.

26:33.254 --> 26:36.257
I did a piece on Maurice Sendak last year of Civilization.

26:36.490 --> 26:37.331
magazine.

26:37.371 --> 26:38.332
It'll be in my new book.

26:38.352 --> 26:38.753
Oh great.

26:39.294 --> 26:40.315
But he did execics.

26:40.375 --> 26:43.419
He's totally taken by Melville.

26:43.439 --> 26:47.184
And so he went out to Melville's west out here.

26:47.204 --> 26:49.647
Errol, Errol, Errol, Errol Henry, or whatever he is.

26:49.707 --> 26:50.428
Yeah.

26:50.448 --> 26:51.149
And the same thing.

26:51.169 --> 26:53.773
They let him in to the study and stuff.

26:53.793 --> 26:56.937
And then they closed the doors and he jumped in the back.

26:57.197 --> 26:58.218
How could you not?

26:58.238 --> 27:02.464
You know, you're getting looked out at the desk at the ring lock and this is

27:02.663 --> 27:04.245
There's something that you're getting here.

27:04.425 --> 27:05.306
Total.

27:05.506 --> 27:09.911
It certainly isn't going to translate into the same creative impulse, but you're going to feel something.

27:10.952 --> 27:12.493
Definitely.

27:12.573 --> 27:13.735
It's the kind of thing I do.

27:13.855 --> 27:15.336
Yeah, yeah.

27:15.356 --> 27:18.079
In a small way, but I love it.

27:18.139 --> 27:21.142
So what's next then?

27:21.363 --> 27:22.344
You're doing a movie, right?

27:22.584 --> 27:23.365
Well, I'm not.

27:23.605 --> 27:25.407
I'm Stephen Spielberg.

27:25.427 --> 27:26.708
It must be very interesting to him.

27:27.089 --> 27:30.732
I think it is, and it's going to be a challenge for him in a lot of ways.

27:30.752 --> 27:31.253
I think so, yeah.

27:31.368 --> 27:33.270
But I think he's up to the challenge.

27:33.991 --> 27:37.675
Do you have a take on how he's going to characterize it?

27:37.695 --> 27:45.364
Not exactly, but we've had a couple of conversations, and he's meant to hire the screenwriter this week, actually.

27:45.384 --> 27:46.646
I know they've been negotiating.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.908
That's a job all into itself.

27:49.169 --> 27:54.675
You have to admire these people who can take 10 years' worth of work.

27:55.145 --> 28:01.173
scholarly research and get a 120-page treatment, however they describe it.

28:01.694 --> 28:03.336
It's a different work.

28:03.616 --> 28:06.420
Once it leaves your hands... That's the way I felt, too.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.761
That's exactly the way I felt.

28:08.182 --> 28:13.909
And I think the writers who come to that conclusion early on serve themselves better.

28:13.929 --> 28:14.690
I couldn't agree with them more.

28:15.331 --> 28:18.656
You can meddle with a thing and make demands, blah, blah, blah.

28:18.816 --> 28:19.377
Forget about it.

28:20.798 --> 28:22.701
Have faith in the person who's going to do it.

28:22.861 --> 28:25.084
And I did have faith in him.

28:25.435 --> 28:29.921
I adored Private Ryan and Schindler also.

28:29.961 --> 28:36.830
And you know, Armstead isn't a half-bad movie either, which I just saw this summer with my kids.

28:36.850 --> 28:39.634
But he'll do a very interesting job.

28:39.654 --> 28:40.395
I think he will.

28:40.615 --> 28:41.276
I think he will.

28:41.457 --> 28:44.441
And I think the whole, well, the Jewishness.

28:44.461 --> 28:49.547
How he's going to deal with the alleged anti-Semitism is going to be interesting.

28:49.668 --> 28:51.510
And we've had, actually,

28:51.912 --> 28:55.438
some good conversations about that, because that's obviously troubling.

28:55.959 --> 28:56.380
Yeah.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.462
So let me ask this.

28:59.746 --> 29:01.088
Hedlundberg, he died in 74.

29:01.108 --> 29:01.288
Right.

29:01.509 --> 29:02.130
You're a kid.

29:02.571 --> 29:03.092
Yeah.

29:03.973 --> 29:14.652
But had he lived for another 10 or 15 years, and you still had been given access to these papers, what would be the first question you'd ask, Charles?

29:14.672 --> 29:14.832
Oh, man.

29:15.436 --> 29:19.582
Assuming that he's going to get pissed off and cut you off after two, after 10, 15 minutes.

29:20.043 --> 29:20.583
Yeah.

29:20.784 --> 29:23.688
And is there any kind of different ways to do interviews?

29:24.589 --> 29:32.641
Not the first question, but I guess what would be the, what is the enigma for you that, or is there an enigma for you that continues?

29:33.442 --> 29:34.924
Is there still something impenetrable there?

29:34.944 --> 29:41.393
Yeah, well, I'm not sure about that, but I think I would ask him, after all this time, does he realize

29:41.744 --> 29:44.747
what he was saying and doing, for example, in the Des Moines speech.

29:45.527 --> 30:00.380
And which isn't to say the wrongness of your ways about whether we should have been in the war or this and that, but he was a man who really didn't understand people and never understood politics in a big way.

30:00.741 --> 30:07.406
I just wonder if he came around as anded to understand why what he said was wrong.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.850
He certainly never recanted anything.

30:10.910 --> 30:11.430
Never, never.

30:12.102 --> 30:15.425
And, I mean, do you think there was a naivete combined with a stubbornness?

30:15.645 --> 30:20.469
Yes, I think that's the equation right there, naivete plus stubbornness.

30:20.489 --> 30:22.471
And that equals hubris, I think.

30:22.511 --> 30:23.011
I think so.

30:23.732 --> 30:28.356
Plus, you know, he was twenty-five years old when he became... Well, when he became God.

30:28.456 --> 30:29.417
When he became God.

30:29.437 --> 30:40.406
And when anything he uttered was suddenly like the Delphi oracle, and important and correct, and it was gospel.

30:40.546 --> 30:41.907
That's the point, it was gospel.

30:42.292 --> 30:44.755
He really pissed FDR off in a big way, didn't he?

30:44.775 --> 30:47.058
Yeah, well, earlier with the airmail.

30:47.839 --> 30:49.802
I mean, they disliked each other going in.

30:50.222 --> 30:53.507
Of course, you have one guy who thinks he's the American icon.

30:54.228 --> 30:56.331
These people don't like competition either.

30:56.351 --> 30:57.192
Well, exactly.

30:57.592 --> 31:00.376
And here Lindbergh doesn't even have to run for office.

31:00.476 --> 31:00.977
That's right.

31:01.037 --> 31:06.404
And if he had, it would be like Eisenhower running for office.

31:06.444 --> 31:06.544
Yeah.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.714
Or Reagan, you know.

31:08.814 --> 31:09.616
Yeah, at least.

31:09.636 --> 31:10.477
We love our heroes.

31:10.897 --> 31:12.380
Absolutely, absolutely.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.624
Although the flip side is, once you're elected, you suddenly become accountable.

31:15.644 --> 31:16.505
That's right.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.969
And Lindbergh was never accountable to anybody.

31:18.989 --> 31:20.191
He played it that way.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.533
He was a very bright guy.

31:22.174 --> 31:26.139
His entire life, he had to answer to nobody.

31:28.202 --> 31:32.869
The marriage, of course, you deal with.

31:34.132 --> 31:43.241
I guess going back to the beginning, I guess Mrs. Lindbergh anticipated that you would discover things about their... I guess so.

31:43.441 --> 31:45.022
I mean, she was happy to see him go away.

31:47.264 --> 31:48.726
His absences became welcome.

31:48.946 --> 31:51.188
Well, exactly, which was really something.

31:51.568 --> 31:59.436
But I'll tell you, when I was going through her personal stuff, sometimes I really did wonder why she would allow me to see this.

32:01.177 --> 32:02.639
Vindication, maybe, for herself?

32:02.659 --> 32:02.779
Maybe.

32:02.999 --> 32:04.020
I think so.

32:04.270 --> 32:12.084
something, because she gave, you know, and she was quite a capable woman in her own right, but everything was for him.

32:12.124 --> 32:12.444
I don't know.

32:12.645 --> 32:22.903
Yeah, and I, no, I think you're correct on this, and I think she, and to continue that line, because I think she suffered a great deal, and I think she wanted that put out there somehow.

32:23.086 --> 32:27.112
And she didn't know how to tell, she didn't know how to put that out there, too.

32:27.132 --> 32:27.813
That's the point.

32:27.833 --> 32:29.696
She did not know how to ask for what she wanted.

32:29.796 --> 32:36.387
You know, there are two biographies I'd love to, one is forthcoming when it's done, but Stacey, what's her name?

32:36.407 --> 32:36.907
Stacey Schiff?

32:37.248 --> 32:37.568
Yeah.

32:37.648 --> 32:42.015
She's doing a biography of Joyce's wife, which would be very, very interesting.

32:42.055 --> 32:42.536
Really?

32:42.656 --> 32:45.981
I thought there was a couple, it was a great one, by Brenda Maddox.

32:46.362 --> 32:46.602
Nora.

32:46.742 --> 32:47.624
Is it Joyce's wife?

32:48.205 --> 32:48.385
Ooh.

32:48.922 --> 32:51.186
That's right.

32:51.246 --> 32:53.910
That's a great one.

32:54.751 --> 32:56.774
Maybe it's Lawrence's wife.

32:57.195 --> 32:59.499
I thought it was Joyce's wife.

33:01.081 --> 33:02.423
No, no, no.

33:02.443 --> 33:02.844
Never mind.

33:03.004 --> 33:04.006
Cut, cut, cut.

33:04.046 --> 33:05.168
Nabokov's wife.

33:05.188 --> 33:06.390
Oh, that would be interesting.

33:07.932 --> 33:11.558
The Brenda Maddox book I've got in my head is a wonderful book.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.883
No, but Nabokov's wife, which is a very capable, talented woman.

33:14.943 --> 33:16.245
And then you think also of

33:16.529 --> 33:19.973
of Tolstoy's wife who put up a lot of crap.

33:20.494 --> 33:22.897
I mean, he was running away from her at the train station.

33:22.917 --> 33:23.338
Yeah, really.

33:23.358 --> 33:24.740
And, you know, you look at her diaries.

33:26.322 --> 33:30.547
I'm wondering if, you know, if this is the handmaiden kind of a situation here.

33:30.667 --> 33:31.368
I think so.

33:31.388 --> 33:32.149
I think there's a lot of that.

33:32.169 --> 33:40.380
A very capable, intelligent woman who's really totally giving up the whole wife for the greater glory of the husband.

33:40.400 --> 33:40.720
I don't know.

33:40.740 --> 33:41.441
I'm just thinking out loud here.

33:41.461 --> 33:42.823
No, I think there's something to that.

33:43.141 --> 33:44.504
It's Nabokov's wife.

33:44.524 --> 33:47.750
It's not the brendamatic look-up.

33:48.651 --> 33:53.059
I think Nabokov would welcome the comparison, though.

33:53.120 --> 33:53.240
Yeah.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.244
If he got momentarily mistaken for Joyce.

33:55.985 --> 33:58.209
Indeed.

33:58.229 --> 33:58.690
I'm sorry.

33:59.712 --> 34:02.838
So is Abe.

34:02.858 --> 34:03.118
I don't know.

34:03.138 --> 34:04.120
Was there a question there?

34:04.538 --> 34:06.080
What's your schedule, by the way?

34:06.160 --> 34:09.164
Well, I've got until 10.30, I think.

34:09.604 --> 34:09.965
Okay.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.049
Because I would like to, I've got plenty of stuff here.

34:13.930 --> 34:18.315
Well, but I mean, that is to say, you and I can easily talk another 10 minutes.

34:19.136 --> 34:20.178
I want you to sign my book.

34:20.298 --> 34:22.420
Or even, yes, 10.30.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.682
I want you to sign my book.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.846
Maybe we can go outside and you can... I bought the wrong book?

34:27.847 --> 34:28.788
Is that true?

34:28.949 --> 34:29.289
Yeah.

34:30.611 --> 34:31.592
I questioned that.

34:31.977 --> 34:33.339
Oh, don't tell him.

34:33.399 --> 34:33.939
How was that?

34:33.959 --> 34:36.442
I haven't even looked at it yet.

34:36.462 --> 34:44.912
These are review books, but you know, the color, I had it laid out, and I was in a rush this morning, and I grabbed my notebook, and I grabbed my... Don't sign this one.

34:44.932 --> 34:45.553
No, I won't.

34:45.573 --> 34:46.755
I grabbed the wrong book.

34:46.775 --> 34:47.636
Oh, thanks.

34:47.856 --> 34:48.437
That's light.

34:48.697 --> 34:50.919
Why don't you give me your... Do you mind if I mail it to you?

34:50.940 --> 34:51.040
Yeah.

34:52.842 --> 34:53.302
Get a P.O.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.043
box or something?

34:54.083 --> 34:55.064
I'm sorry about that.

34:55.104 --> 34:55.765
Give your address in that way.

34:55.785 --> 34:57.467
Or I could wait till the next time we see each other.

34:57.507 --> 34:58.589
Well, that may be forever.

34:59.129 --> 34:59.790
That could be.

35:00.412 --> 35:01.433
I mean, at the rate I go.

35:01.453 --> 35:02.174
What a jerk.

35:02.194 --> 35:03.376
I am.

35:03.516 --> 35:04.037
Excuse me.

35:06.620 --> 35:08.162
I'll send you a copy of my book.

35:08.182 --> 35:08.502
How's that?

35:08.522 --> 35:09.664
There's a present for you.

35:12.067 --> 35:12.528
Watch your book.

35:13.088 --> 35:14.250
You got my book, A Gentle Madness?

35:14.270 --> 35:14.570
Yeah.

35:15.111 --> 35:15.551
I love that book.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.893
Do you like that book?

35:16.913 --> 35:17.554
It's kind of fun.

35:18.255 --> 35:18.916
You know my book.

35:19.597 --> 35:20.778
I bought it.

35:21.219 --> 35:25.184
The paperback's finally coming out next year.

35:25.244 --> 35:26.566
When did the hardback come out?

35:26.586 --> 35:27.246
95.

35:27.387 --> 35:28.088
Yeah.

35:28.508 --> 35:30.030
That's right, because I was just...

35:30.601 --> 35:31.482
starting to write.

35:32.844 --> 35:34.286
Yeah.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.668
Oh, no, I adored it.

35:35.688 --> 35:36.309
Well, thank you.

35:36.349 --> 35:37.911
No, because it's the same compulsion.

35:38.191 --> 35:45.281
This new book, I'm traveling, insanely traveling to the great libraries of the world through history.

35:45.842 --> 35:50.548
And that's just for one, for, well, now it's more like two chapters because it's so good.

35:51.029 --> 35:53.993
Next month, in three weeks, in Guinemar, they're both in Greece.

35:54.158 --> 36:03.833
And then I spent five days with the monks, because this is a repository of Byzantine culture, and it has been there for a thousand years.

36:03.973 --> 36:08.560
And then I'm going to Pergamum just to see the ruins of the ancient library that's still there.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.824
And then I'm going to Ephesus, and then I'm going to St.

36:10.864 --> 36:17.314
Catherine's on Mount Sinai, and then I'm going to go to the site of the new Alexandrian library and the old one.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.353
Maybe a thousand words of text, if it's that much.

36:20.853 --> 36:23.917
But you have to go, and you have to do it.

36:23.957 --> 36:29.163
But it was a very expensive trip, so I pitched it to Smithsonian, and they're buying a story.

36:29.343 --> 36:30.344
Oh, great.

36:30.444 --> 36:32.706
They pay very, very well.

36:32.726 --> 36:33.708
Do they?

36:34.468 --> 36:37.432
Yeah, five grand, which is not bad.

36:38.313 --> 36:44.179
Plus some expenses, plus exposure that is wonderful, plus it's a one-time use.

36:44.598 --> 36:51.465
I intend to just lift this and move it over to the book.

36:51.926 --> 36:54.689
So I'm really excited about that.

36:55.029 --> 36:56.891
When do you go?

36:57.112 --> 37:02.778
I leave on the 22nd of October and I go straight to Pergamum.

37:02.918 --> 37:04.219
It's a very complicated trip.

37:04.239 --> 37:05.140
I wanted to go to Israel.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.703
I wanted to go to the Cuman Caves.

37:08.324 --> 37:09.786
Dead Sea Scrolls.

37:10.066 --> 37:10.967
Oh, is that where they're from?

37:10.987 --> 37:12.148
Yeah, right, right, right.

37:12.329 --> 37:13.670
And I just can't fix it.

37:13.690 --> 37:17.294
You can't do four countries in three places and spend six.

37:17.314 --> 37:21.839
Well, you can't, but I've really got to do the ATHOS part right.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.842
That's going to take time.

37:24.282 --> 37:27.105
I mean, I've got 14 plane flights.

37:27.506 --> 37:30.990
And, you know, it's hard.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.572
Yeah, it is.

37:32.692 --> 37:35.855
And I did an October trip last year that was just as ambitious.

37:35.895 --> 37:37.437
It was four countries.

37:37.923 --> 37:43.911
By the time I've done it, it's going to be 14 countries, but just to get little pieces of the puzzle.

37:43.931 --> 37:46.855
I mean, you're writing about, you have to go to Durham Cathedral.

37:46.935 --> 37:52.522
It's the one cathedral library that survived the dissolution of the monasteries.

37:52.542 --> 37:53.443
You've got to go there.

37:53.463 --> 37:55.346
You want to go to Hereford, where they were chained books.

37:55.366 --> 37:56.727
The chained books are still there.

37:56.807 --> 37:59.191
You want to go to St.

37:59.211 --> 38:05.719
Gall, where they designed, you know, where the scriptorium plans were made.

38:06.205 --> 38:08.388
Monte Cassino with Benedictine Du Bois.

38:08.408 --> 38:08.688
I don't know.

38:08.708 --> 38:13.694
This may be very, too ambitious, but I'm doing it.

38:14.155 --> 38:21.184
I don't think you look at the writing and you say, now the writing has to, as you say, equal the material.

38:21.244 --> 38:23.266
It has to be up to the quality of the material.

38:25.589 --> 38:35.942
The whole thing about book culture, libraries of the future, information, preservation, issues, you know, these are the

38:37.475 --> 38:38.957
I'm doing booksellers.

38:39.037 --> 38:42.561
I'm doing the Jewish booksellers who escaped Hitler.

38:45.044 --> 38:46.586
That's an excellent story.

38:46.786 --> 38:54.455
And while I was there, I did Max Israel and his brother Nico in the Netherlands.

38:54.475 --> 39:00.643
Max is one of the great, he is the great bookseller specializing in medicine and science today, particularly medicine.

39:00.763 --> 39:01.304
Why is that?

39:01.504 --> 39:05.068
He escaped the Germans, but he hid in the forest for two and a half years.

39:05.437 --> 39:08.861
And the books they kept bringing him were all books on science and letters.

39:08.881 --> 39:12.004
Is that true?

39:12.024 --> 39:14.566
It's true.

39:14.647 --> 39:18.511
He got to Switzerland.

39:18.531 --> 39:22.254
They had an older brother, they said he was the smartest one of them all, and the Nazis got him.

39:22.715 --> 39:24.136
He's gone.

39:25.598 --> 39:28.421
And their stories really haven't been written.

39:28.501 --> 39:30.763
And they're up there.

39:32.785 --> 39:35.308
Even since I started this,

39:35.862 --> 39:37.283
I've had four people done.

39:37.303 --> 39:39.786
I had the last interview with Alfred Cajan in New York.

39:39.966 --> 39:45.090
He died three months after I did the interview.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.612
I'm grateful that I got that.

39:47.372 --> 39:48.794
I start with Otto Bettman.

39:49.034 --> 39:49.514
Really?

39:49.614 --> 39:51.156
Yeah, Otto Bettman.

39:51.176 --> 39:52.997
Remember when the Bettman archive was sold?

39:53.938 --> 39:55.460
Sure, sure.

39:55.480 --> 40:00.944
If somebody had told me this guy was alive and well and living in Florida and that his mind was sharp as a crack.

40:00.964 --> 40:02.486
How old was he?

40:02.506 --> 40:03.827
I thought he was 93.

40:04.617 --> 40:08.161
I called him and went down immediately to see him.

40:08.302 --> 40:12.727
And of course, here he is, he has touched every decade of the 20th century.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.010
He basically revolutionized communications.

40:15.030 --> 40:17.553
He came up with this idea of art, imagery.

40:18.114 --> 40:20.677
And then he goes into the next generation.

40:20.717 --> 40:22.619
He sells it to Gates.

40:22.639 --> 40:24.762
Gates is digitizing the whole thing.

40:24.782 --> 40:26.764
But he still has this abiding faith.

40:26.784 --> 40:28.467
And plus, he's an emigre.

40:28.527 --> 40:33.713
He was a rare books librarian at the German State Library in Berlin.

40:34.047 --> 40:37.912
He got fired, plus he started taking photographs with the Leica.

40:38.452 --> 40:40.815
So he comes to Leica and says, that's a great story.

40:40.835 --> 40:48.685
And he is a world of community and class.

40:48.845 --> 40:51.468
And so my wife and I were visiting.

40:51.509 --> 40:55.794
He's got a little organ in his apartment.

40:55.814 --> 40:57.676
And I said, could you play something?

40:57.696 --> 40:59.138
I had my favorite photo.

40:59.679 --> 41:01.641
He's played this beautiful little minuet.

41:02.735 --> 41:04.917
And then we went to lunch, and I said, why Bach?

41:06.239 --> 41:13.727
And he said, I believe that Bach was sent, that God sent Bach here in a order of chaos.

41:14.308 --> 41:17.331
And he said, Beethoven goes off, and he goes here, and he goes there.

41:17.351 --> 41:19.854
He said, Bach, and this is how I end the prologue.

41:19.874 --> 41:22.457
He always brings us back to where we started.

41:22.477 --> 41:23.198
Great.

41:23.218 --> 41:25.981
I love the whole idea of a circle.

41:26.001 --> 41:26.641
Perfect for you.

41:26.661 --> 41:27.983
And a continuum.

41:28.003 --> 41:29.164
And here is this.

41:29.184 --> 41:30.686
I don't know.

41:30.706 --> 41:31.627
It's about it.

41:31.647 --> 41:32.708
It's about it.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.166
It's great.

41:34.667 --> 41:37.410
It's great.

41:42.297 --> 41:44.981
Do you get frustrated when you're around?

41:46.263 --> 41:51.070
Do you sometimes think that this is too hard, you know, I'm not going to get it?

41:52.712 --> 42:00.464
Yeah, I'll, you know, I never, yeah, there were some days I did think it was too hard, and how would I get through it?

42:00.484 --> 42:02.847
I remember when I was about a year into the

42:03.502 --> 42:06.926
papers, and I still felt I hadn't really made a dent.

42:06.946 --> 42:09.330
So I began to think, oh, I'll never get through it.

42:09.890 --> 42:10.932
So there were those days.

42:12.013 --> 42:18.601
And then there was the day, oh, day, yes, it turned out to be six months.

42:19.563 --> 42:27.733
But when I had all my notes, all the papers I had Xeroxed from the Lindbergh archives, everything lined up, and I began sorting it all out.

42:27.773 --> 42:29.155
And I thought,

42:29.320 --> 42:31.705
I mean, literally tens of thousands of notes.

42:31.725 --> 42:32.847
And this is back in California.

42:32.867 --> 42:33.889
Piles in California.

42:34.330 --> 42:37.416
And I literally laid everything in piles by chapter.

42:37.476 --> 42:41.464
And I just looked at it, and that was the moment of hopelessness.

42:42.046 --> 42:43.408
That was utter despair.

42:43.629 --> 42:47.717
And I said, how will I ever spin this into a book?

42:48.170 --> 42:49.793
I mean, that just seemed unbelievable.

42:49.813 --> 42:53.158
I imagine the anxiety was probably for five minutes, and then you stood there.

42:53.178 --> 42:55.101
Yeah, and then I said, okay, yes, that's exactly right.

42:55.121 --> 42:55.822
Let's get to work.

42:56.023 --> 42:57.525
Okay, but now I've had that moment.

42:57.545 --> 42:58.066
Let's get to work.

42:58.086 --> 42:59.208
Yeah, I had my little cry.

43:00.350 --> 43:01.151
Get over yourself.

43:01.191 --> 43:01.932
Now do your job.

43:01.952 --> 43:02.653
That's wonderful.

43:02.713 --> 43:04.777
And you don't have, do you have assistants?

43:04.937 --> 43:06.239
No, I'm the whole thing.

43:06.299 --> 43:07.321
I do everything.

43:07.341 --> 43:08.963
I mean, I even have to grab my own tape.

43:08.984 --> 43:09.625
You have to.

43:10.165 --> 43:13.030
Because this, you see, I'll get home.

43:37.259 --> 43:49.173
Good morning, Mr. Stoeck.

43:50.695 --> 43:51.416
I hear it, all right?

43:51.576 --> 43:53.078
Yeah, let me see.

43:53.098 --> 43:55.141
Where's the first place?

43:55.561 --> 43:56.863
Just listen, you're going to hear it right here.

43:56.883 --> 43:57.564
Right here, OK.

44:00.387 --> 44:04.452
Connie, come here.

44:06.414 --> 44:06.895
Where you going?

44:07.685 --> 44:22.568
It's going to pick up.

44:25.533 --> 44:27.516
He doesn't know the number of the old.
