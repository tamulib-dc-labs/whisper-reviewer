00:01.718 --> 00:05.683
Okay, we're talking to Professor Gates at Harvard.

00:05.923 --> 00:06.864
I'll put this here.

00:06.884 --> 00:09.467
You quote in the New York Times, we've made a canon.

00:09.968 --> 00:14.554
Tell me about that, about making a canon.

00:14.994 --> 00:20.621
I mean, I know the spirit within which it was expressed, but maybe we can add it at that level.

00:20.641 --> 00:30.493
Well, there are, by the best counts, approximately 150, 160 anthologies of African American literature.

00:31.925 --> 00:36.531
published since 1845 when Les Senelles was published in New Orleans in French.

00:39.494 --> 00:45.322
And each anthology, like each syllabus, per course defines a canon.

00:46.984 --> 00:47.785
You might not like it.

00:47.825 --> 00:53.351
The person might be aware of what their principles of selection are.

00:54.873 --> 00:58.658
Most have some sort of apologia at the beginning

00:59.060 --> 01:02.483
You know, they cop a plea to explain why people aren't there and why people are there.

01:02.503 --> 01:20.059
But no matter how rudimentary the effort is, it still constitutes a canon.

01:20.079 --> 01:28.206
And none has ever been comprehensive enough, large enough,

01:28.405 --> 01:41.339
having the sweep, the range, the depth, to establish a full canon of 250 years of writing of African Americans in English.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.562
And what do I mean by a full canon?

01:44.563 --> 01:55.055
Because of page limitations, we always had to leave out or include things just to show diversity within the tradition.

01:55.595 --> 01:57.197
I call it the Sears and Roebuck approach.

01:57.785 --> 02:05.053
a little this, a little that, a little this to show almost, it's like a museum, specimens in a museum.

02:06.194 --> 02:19.088
And not to think of a coherent logic, a flow, that connects the writings of Phyllis Wheatley in 1773 with Toni Morrison in 1993, the year that she got the Nobel Prize.

02:19.108 --> 02:20.409
There are very few companies.

02:23.513 --> 02:23.853
Thank you.

02:25.094 --> 02:27.437
There are very few publishers that

02:28.447 --> 02:29.748
Market anthology, it's that big.

02:29.848 --> 02:30.429
Oxford's one.

02:30.469 --> 02:32.271
Norton, obviously, is the Rolls Royster.

02:33.812 --> 02:34.012
Oh, right.

02:34.032 --> 02:35.213
Yeah.

02:35.233 --> 02:44.742
So I've been raised on Norton anthologies like every other student, and I figured that we needed, if they were the anthology company, we needed to have a Norton anthology.

02:45.503 --> 02:51.269
And it took two years to persuade them to do it, all these marketing studies.

02:52.109 --> 02:55.973
And then once they were persuaded, I decided I wouldn't do it by myself or with one other person, that I would

02:57.708 --> 03:05.937
make it a real event by getting some of the greatest scholars in the African American tradition, writing today, to be my partners.

03:06.098 --> 03:09.061
And I did that, and it became a cooperative effort.

03:09.722 --> 03:20.314
Often I felt like Duke Ellington orchestrating Billy Strayhorn and Johnny Hodges and all of his other great musicians.

03:21.155 --> 03:25.099
And so we have, for the first time, established

03:27.560 --> 03:30.004
A canon.

03:30.124 --> 03:34.210
And an arguable canon as well, I think, is important.

03:34.230 --> 03:34.570
Sure.

03:34.730 --> 03:35.872
I mean, people will take it on.

03:35.932 --> 03:36.653
People say, why?

03:36.773 --> 03:38.095
Already people are writing to us.

03:39.337 --> 03:49.492
There's a two-page letter I've sent a copy of from a scholar to one of the period editors saying, you got it wrong, and people have written, you made a mistake, you've done this.

03:50.634 --> 03:51.174
And that's great.

03:51.315 --> 03:55.120
And then there'll be another generation that'll publish...

03:55.673 --> 03:58.656
another, you know, I'm sure several anthologies about it.

03:58.676 --> 04:05.142
Oh, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Professor Gates does the second edition of this in about eight or nine or ten years.

04:05.162 --> 04:11.629
And I think Norton at this point, given the sales figures, would like me to do other anthologies, and I do want to do other anthologies.

04:11.689 --> 04:12.550
We can talk about that.

04:13.851 --> 04:23.841
But by canon, I mean what is the... A canon is to a tradition like

04:24.226 --> 04:26.549
Canon is the marrow of tradition.

04:26.569 --> 04:27.049
The marrow.

04:27.570 --> 04:29.112
The marrow of the bone.

04:29.132 --> 04:30.433
Whether they come to transcribe.

04:30.593 --> 04:32.856
Sure, I understand.

04:32.876 --> 04:35.879
It is the heart, the meat, the essence.

04:35.959 --> 04:36.660
What are the best?

04:36.740 --> 04:42.507
What is the internal logic around which a tradition unfolded?

04:43.068 --> 04:49.515
It's not, on the one hand, inappropriate to say that a tradition is defined in this essentialist way.

04:50.196 --> 04:52.258
It's just everything that anybody black wrote.

04:52.762 --> 04:55.585
And that's what the definition of African-American literature is.

04:56.005 --> 04:56.986
What's American literature?

04:57.386 --> 04:58.588
Anything in American room.

04:58.608 --> 04:59.468
What's English literature?

04:59.488 --> 05:00.870
Anything in Englishman room.

05:00.890 --> 05:01.871
What's women's literature?

05:01.891 --> 05:02.771
Anything in woman room.

05:03.272 --> 05:15.083
But when you're trying to establish it as a tradition with a canon, what are the touchstones?

05:17.105 --> 05:17.966
My feet are wet.

05:17.986 --> 05:18.506
I'm sitting here.

05:18.546 --> 05:19.427
I had to dry my socks.

05:20.128 --> 05:22.330
My shoes are drying over there because they got soaking wet.

05:24.605 --> 05:27.429
What are the touchstones of the tradition?

05:27.469 --> 05:29.031
What are the sublime specimens?

05:30.032 --> 05:44.591
What are the artifacts that utilize form and content in new, expressive, meaningful, pivotal, salient ways?

05:46.414 --> 05:51.220
There's a difference between Terry McMillan, whom I love, as a person I love reading,

05:51.858 --> 05:53.520
But she doesn't have Tony Lawrence.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.664
And if you can't, there's a difference between Terry McMillan and Tony Morrison.

05:56.684 --> 05:59.869
And if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be a professor of literature.

06:00.289 --> 06:19.975
What the Norton Anthology is, is an attempt to draw a line between Phyllis Wheaton and Tony Morrison and explain, no matter how meandering that line is, how the two things are connected formally, internally, by language use.

06:20.343 --> 06:21.625
That's what we've done in this.

06:21.645 --> 06:27.873
Not by ideology, not by gender, not by region, but how do the texts speak to each other?

06:27.913 --> 06:37.746
A key word is formal, because it is the formalization of a body of work, which now actually enables it, allows it to be taught in a formal setting.

06:37.987 --> 06:38.387
You got it.

06:38.788 --> 06:41.051
Now any teacher anywhere can teach African-American reading.

06:41.071 --> 06:44.175
You can't say, well, there's no book, so we don't have the stop books.

06:44.215 --> 06:47.099
What text are we reading?

06:47.780 --> 06:50.063
You know, I think the fact that...

06:50.296 --> 06:58.985
African American studies at all of your major institutions, though, does speak eloquently to the work.

06:59.726 --> 07:00.887
How about leaving people out?

07:00.907 --> 07:04.591
I mean, were there people that you left out for prioritizing?

07:04.651 --> 07:09.577
Are there people that— No, first of all, there were people we had to leave out because of Wright's.

07:10.217 --> 07:10.718
I mentioned them.

07:10.738 --> 07:12.239
That I understand, the copyrights.

07:12.259 --> 07:12.700
Sure.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.485
Jay Wright didn't want his poetry in a Norton anthology.

07:17.802 --> 07:20.346
because he felt that he was burned by the company once.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.055
An unfortunate attitude.

07:26.095 --> 07:26.435
It was.

07:26.455 --> 07:28.318
It was unfortunate.

07:28.639 --> 07:34.268
The estate of Zorny L. Hurston wouldn't let Their Eyes Are Watching God be reprinted.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.150
They sell a couple hundred thousand copies a year.

07:36.771 --> 07:40.197
Why have I had it?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.565
I have to think all these things add to sales, but

07:45.950 --> 07:46.931
I don't want to get into that.

07:46.951 --> 07:47.772
As I do, too.

07:48.032 --> 07:48.933
Right.

07:49.313 --> 07:51.615
And, of course, the Library of America is another canon.

07:51.895 --> 07:52.236
Sure.

07:52.836 --> 07:55.459
And the character represented in both.

07:55.479 --> 07:56.179
It's great.

07:56.279 --> 07:57.961
I would think it's spectacular.

07:57.981 --> 07:59.562
It's spectacular.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.346
Martin Delaney, the father of black nationalism, was left out.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.309
He'll be in the next edition.

08:06.889 --> 08:11.373
An oversight or just a regrettable omission, I guess?

08:11.453 --> 08:12.674
Regrettable omission.

08:12.694 --> 08:14.556
The period editor didn't feel that he had

08:14.992 --> 08:18.300
enough room to put him in, but he needs to be there.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.888
I mean, he's of great historical importance, so he has to be there.

08:23.933 --> 08:24.735
So we'll put him in.

08:25.176 --> 08:28.684
And if we had thought about it, which we didn't, Nellie and I could have put him in at the last minute.

08:28.704 --> 08:30.368
I mean, we had final say.

08:31.715 --> 08:33.558
It was ours, really.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.863
You know, as Norton says, a book is a living thing.

08:36.063 --> 08:36.884
Right.

08:37.165 --> 08:39.870
And Norton's are living books.

08:40.611 --> 08:43.897
And plus, what, 150,000 of this already in print?

08:43.917 --> 08:44.518
50,000.

08:44.819 --> 08:45.440
So you're 50,000.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.041
Yeah.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.846
I mean, 30,000 sold between December 9th

08:49.282 --> 08:50.284
And December 24th.

08:50.344 --> 08:51.485
That's right.

08:51.505 --> 08:54.110
I have a first edition that I'm going to ask you to sign before we go.

08:54.130 --> 08:54.570
Oh, great.

08:54.811 --> 08:55.972
We call this the Mothership.

08:56.053 --> 08:58.136
This is the Mothership of the Black Tradition.

08:58.156 --> 08:58.617
That's great.

08:58.797 --> 09:01.561
And there's a CD-ROM that goes with it, which is... Yeah.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.725
That CD-ROM, that was my idea.

09:04.926 --> 09:14.261
And that was one of the... I think that is a major innovation.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.825
This is the classic case of the margins.

09:17.497 --> 09:19.820
in forming the shape of the center.

09:21.042 --> 09:23.585
All literature has a vernacular base.

09:24.527 --> 09:29.734
All literary traditions started on a vernacular base, whether it was English literature or Greek literature or Latin literature.

09:30.414 --> 09:32.798
And African American is no different.

09:32.818 --> 09:42.491
It's just that our oral tradition is so lively and still very much with us as anyone who goes to a theater in a black neighborhood or a black barbershop or beauty parlor understands.

09:42.891 --> 09:44.854
And that tradition surrounds

09:45.593 --> 09:48.076
the written tradition like a Mobius strip.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.603
And so we decided, we persuaded Norton to try to mark it.

09:52.643 --> 09:53.864
At the time, it was a cassette.

09:54.686 --> 09:56.789
We were going to put the oral tradition on a cassette.

09:57.550 --> 10:00.734
And then it became, it took us so long to do it, it became a CD.

10:01.135 --> 10:01.876
It was much better.

10:03.338 --> 10:05.000
Well, it gives you a visual element as well.

10:05.200 --> 10:05.661
We got it.

10:05.781 --> 10:07.083
And people love this thing.

10:07.584 --> 10:12.951
And it will be so useful in teaching literature that I think it will transform...

10:13.201 --> 10:15.544
the way all literature is marketed and taught.

10:15.604 --> 10:18.128
I think all Nortons now will have a CD.

10:18.308 --> 10:21.873
Now, that's a case of the margins and forming the center, which is wonderful.

10:21.913 --> 10:26.760
And this new book of mine is going to conclude with a chapter on books of the 21st century.

10:26.860 --> 10:31.527
And this is, I think, a very meaningful way, the technology.

10:32.589 --> 10:38.537
We talk about the printed book and all that, and we don't have time to get into that here.

10:38.858 --> 10:41.942
But one works as an adjunct to the other.

10:42.175 --> 10:42.616
Right.

10:42.796 --> 10:46.682
So we're canon makers, to paraphrase Justin Jackson, not canon breakers.

10:46.702 --> 10:47.222
That's great.

10:47.503 --> 10:59.260
And what's ironic is, if you're in an emergent field, like we are, we're still trying to establish African American literature as canonical, as a subject worthy to be taught.

11:01.263 --> 11:03.746
And all that's in quotation marks, of course.

11:05.689 --> 11:11.237
So the luxury that our colleagues, our peers, and other areas of literary criticism...

11:11.842 --> 11:17.351
can't assume in trashing the canon, because they've had a canon for a century, is something we can't assume.

11:18.273 --> 11:23.601
You know, there hasn't been an officially defined, established canon of African American literature.

11:24.142 --> 11:29.912
If you had three students applying to Harvard in the English department, and I said, what did you study?

11:29.932 --> 11:31.655
They said, I took an African American literature course.

11:32.095 --> 11:33.357
I can't presume what they've studied.

11:34.018 --> 11:34.559
I can now.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.062
I mean, I will be able to assume.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.444
It could be anything.

11:37.762 --> 11:44.451
It could be whatever the teacher thought, which is fine in terms of individual freedom, but there's got to be a sort of baseline of knowledge.

11:45.152 --> 12:00.794
And I think that one of the most pleasant aspects about the response to our anthology is that very few people left Writers Center, Marxists, black nationalists, feminists, whatever, have major complaints about this anthology.

12:01.215 --> 12:07.043
I mean, they don't see it as being this ideological attack on one sub-school or

12:07.377 --> 12:08.058
blah, blah, blah.

12:08.078 --> 12:10.501
They think it's fair and reasonable.

12:11.182 --> 12:15.108
And I'm very conservative when it comes to aesthetics.

12:15.128 --> 12:23.400
And the fact that we could say things like, this text is better than this text, more complex, and not be challenged is refreshing.

12:24.121 --> 12:26.444
No one really has a problem with that.

12:27.085 --> 12:27.446
So far.

12:29.028 --> 12:33.975
I'd like, if possible, to get a few questions in on, because we're pressed for time, this week.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.274
this matter of the canon, the canon wars that are going on.

12:37.294 --> 12:38.096
Sure.

12:38.116 --> 12:43.988
Shakespeare not being tied... Not being required at Georgetown or Amherst College.

12:44.068 --> 12:44.950
I think it's ridiculous.

12:44.970 --> 12:46.513
I think Shakespeare should be required.

12:46.645 --> 12:51.811
In English, if you're going to be a major in English literature, I'm not saying you have to study Shakespeare.

12:52.071 --> 12:56.536
My undergraduate degree, by the way, Peter Gomes and I were classmates at Bates.

12:56.556 --> 12:56.997
Oh, really?

12:57.337 --> 12:58.959
I haven't seen him since I graduated.

12:59.099 --> 13:06.788
He got an undergraduate degree this year, which I nominated him for, and he nominated me for one two years ago.

13:06.808 --> 13:07.349
There you go.

13:07.789 --> 13:09.031
That was great.

13:09.051 --> 13:11.554
You were talking about, you think it's ridiculous about what?

13:11.574 --> 13:12.014
Yeah.

13:12.074 --> 13:15.218
Right after Georgetown did it, we had a meeting in the English department, and we

13:15.451 --> 13:23.840
It just so happens we were deciding on the shape of the major, and we reaffirmed that there would be certain requirements, and one of those very few requirements was Shakespeare.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.703
I mean, Shakespeare is the man.

13:26.943 --> 13:28.285
That's the way it is.

13:28.825 --> 13:33.650
How can you not study Shakespeare and be educated in the field of English?

13:33.871 --> 13:35.012
Of English literature.

13:35.552 --> 13:36.994
English liturgy for sex.

13:37.274 --> 13:40.918
And then, of course, one of the arguments that made is, and this is a question for you,

13:41.388 --> 13:44.132
Well, literature has to be relevant.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.937
I think this is a question that you hear, a complaint.

13:47.277 --> 13:50.743
Do you believe that literature has to be relevant?

13:50.763 --> 13:51.404
Absolutely not.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.489
All literature is relevant is probably the answer.

13:54.509 --> 13:55.050
Sure.

13:55.070 --> 13:57.213
I mean, you don't study literature.

13:58.035 --> 14:00.258
I'll give you an example.

14:00.278 --> 14:05.386
Robert Penn Warren used to tell his students at Yale, creative writing students, he used to ask them to go around.

14:05.466 --> 14:06.368
It was a little tiny seminar.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.032
You know, you had to fight like hell to get in and submit a writing sample.

14:09.468 --> 14:11.510
And he would say, why are you taking this course?

14:12.611 --> 14:15.915
And people would say all kinds of bullshit.

14:16.275 --> 14:18.437
I want to write the great American novel.

14:18.677 --> 14:19.879
I'm going to do this.

14:20.019 --> 14:22.722
And he'd listen to all this garbage.

14:22.742 --> 14:24.063
And then he'd say, you know what?

14:24.083 --> 14:24.764
This is fine.

14:24.784 --> 14:28.107
I'm glad that you all told me why you're taking this course.

14:28.488 --> 14:30.690
Now I'm going to tell you why I'm teaching this course.

14:31.030 --> 14:36.336
I'm teaching this course to teach you how to get a character into a taxi at the beginning of the story and out of the taxi at the end.

14:36.996 --> 14:37.737
Now to me,

14:38.341 --> 14:46.429
What the study of literature is about is an attempt to, and not to free the wretched of the earth, not to save all the black people who live in the inner city.

14:46.929 --> 15:04.326
As noble and as wonderful as those goals are, there are a lot of other disciplines where you can do that more directly or learn the skills and learn to manage the tools that might possibly inform that outcome much more directly than do the study of literature.

15:05.007 --> 15:08.230
I teach English, African-American literature,

15:08.699 --> 15:25.123
to try to help students to understand the formal, through the formal analysis, why when you were 12 years old you stayed up all night long under a blanket with a flashlight, reading until your mother caught you and made to go to sleep.

15:25.503 --> 15:35.438
You know, how can a jumble of words produce the illusion of worlds and travel and human beings and passion and feeling?

15:35.458 --> 15:37.661
That's what literature, first and foremost, is all about.

15:37.681 --> 15:38.402
It's all illusion.

15:38.888 --> 15:42.391
How do those techniques and tricks of illusion work?

15:42.772 --> 15:48.397
And then how does this text, full of those techniques, speak to another text?

15:48.417 --> 15:49.518
What's it responding to?

15:49.858 --> 15:56.384
It's responding on the one hand to the world around it, to certain specific political, social, historical conditions.

15:56.725 --> 15:59.327
It's also responding amazingly enough to other texts.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.469
It is revising other texts.

16:02.971 --> 16:04.392
It is speaking to other texts.

16:04.412 --> 16:08.676
It is critiquing other texts that have represented similar

16:08.892 --> 16:18.465
experiences, that's wonderful, that's great, and that is what I was trying to do, and that's what I think the study of literature should be all about.

16:18.885 --> 16:36.469
Now, there are many people who think it should be about a lot more, and they're entitled to their opinion, but no matter what you do with the text, no matter where a reading goes, an interpretation goes, to me you have to start with the fact that literature is comprised of language, that it is

16:36.702 --> 16:43.470
formal use of language, and you have to teach your students how to analyze that language use.

16:44.472 --> 16:46.534
After that, blast off wherever you want.

16:46.995 --> 17:00.251
It's only when a teacher sees a text as transparent that the language is somehow not there, that these techniques are not there, that it just contains content.

17:00.812 --> 17:04.216
Toni Morrison wanted people to reduce Beloved to its content.

17:04.236 --> 17:06.439
She would have written an essay about

17:06.824 --> 17:12.131
the woman who killed her children and Margaret, whatever her last name is.

17:12.151 --> 17:13.893
I can't remember her name right here.

17:14.314 --> 17:14.794
But she did.

17:15.355 --> 17:18.539
And she wrote this amazingly complex story.

17:19.140 --> 17:23.786
And that's what I want students to understand about African American literature.

17:24.087 --> 17:27.111
It's not about being black merely, quote unquote.

17:27.131 --> 17:30.095
People could write essays all day long about being black, and they do.

17:30.715 --> 17:33.439
It is about formal languages, rendering...

17:33.858 --> 17:43.690
great themes like love and death, as well as human suffering, racism, the fight against racism, etc.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.193
And that's quite marvelous.

17:46.213 --> 17:49.678
This position must get you some praise and heat from your colleagues.

17:49.698 --> 17:51.540
It is a rather conservative position.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.322
Yeah, but I've been saying it so long.

17:53.342 --> 17:54.384
I mean, everybody knows that.

17:54.644 --> 17:58.849
I mean, I'm not some Neanderthal that I don't want there to be an African-American tradition.

17:58.909 --> 17:59.410
I do.

17:59.592 --> 18:07.732
I mean, some people would say, Hilton Kramer wrote an essay saying African-Americans, I mean, in the New Criterion last month, saying it's just bullshit.

18:07.752 --> 18:08.554
Saying what's bullshit?

18:08.755 --> 18:09.837
African-American studies.

18:10.419 --> 18:12.043
Just the whole field is bullshit.

18:12.063 --> 18:12.684
He said that.

18:12.705 --> 18:13.426
Yeah, you should read it.

18:13.446 --> 18:16.133
It's an attack on the New York Times article about us here.

18:16.737 --> 18:18.580
I thought that was a pretty nice piece.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.461
It was a wonderful piece.

18:19.481 --> 18:21.284
I want to talk to Nellie as well, by the way.

18:21.364 --> 18:22.646
Oh, good.

18:23.147 --> 18:24.489
You can also call me on Monday.

18:25.150 --> 18:25.731
Or next week.

18:25.811 --> 18:26.352
That would be good.

18:26.512 --> 18:27.834
Yeah.

18:27.994 --> 18:29.937
I know we're running short on time.

18:30.879 --> 18:32.100
Now, I feel terrible about this.

18:32.441 --> 18:32.942
Let's worry.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.205
But we could do it on the phone.

18:35.325 --> 18:36.467
The important thing is we've met

18:36.852 --> 18:38.715
Yeah, call me on Monday.

18:38.755 --> 18:42.141
Okay, but I do want to— When we go out, we'll make an appointment with Joe, and now— Okay.

18:42.161 --> 18:44.105
Because I like talking to you.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.709
Well, there's some areas we've got to get into, and it'll be fun, too.

18:46.729 --> 18:46.990
Sure.

18:47.671 --> 18:48.913
But you've got fifteen minutes.

18:48.933 --> 18:49.494
We're all right.

18:49.514 --> 18:49.715
Oh, we do.

18:49.735 --> 18:49.835
Good.

18:49.915 --> 19:00.193
Okay, well, I think that you say in the book, which is very important, having written about Dorothy West and familiar with the Harlem Renaissance theory, I guess

19:00.308 --> 19:02.912
You feel that we are really in a golden age.

19:03.052 --> 19:03.413
Yeah.

19:03.433 --> 19:03.813
Right down.

19:03.913 --> 19:05.536
I mean, that was the renaissance.

19:05.556 --> 19:06.477
This is the golden age.

19:06.497 --> 19:06.958
That's right.

19:07.118 --> 19:08.400
That's true.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.622
Give me a comment on that.

19:09.682 --> 19:16.051
Well, in terms of quantity and quality, we are... I think quality.

19:16.071 --> 19:16.852
Quality.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.135
We are experiencing... It's right out there.

19:19.235 --> 19:23.542
An outburst of tremendous creativity and it's self-conscious.

19:23.602 --> 19:24.423
Across the board.

19:24.463 --> 19:27.227
Walter Mosley, for instance, is as good a...

19:27.393 --> 19:29.916
Yes, a detective writer as there is going.

19:30.096 --> 19:33.380
You've got a Toni Morrison, but Toni Morrison is a Walter Morley.

19:33.400 --> 19:33.640
That's true.

19:34.041 --> 19:37.705
And by... I forgot what I was going to say.

19:37.725 --> 19:38.005
I'm sorry.

19:38.065 --> 19:39.267
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

19:39.287 --> 19:41.029
It's a conversation.

19:43.692 --> 19:44.773
We are experiencing it.

19:44.793 --> 19:46.435
It's quantity and quality.

19:46.855 --> 19:57.147
Well, in part it's... I think someone said that more books by black authors were published last February, Black History Month,

19:57.667 --> 19:59.229
than in the whole of the Harlem Renaissance.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.352
Harlem Renaissance involved 50 people.

20:01.372 --> 20:03.054
50 people.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.541
Max, if you count even the minor people.

20:08.322 --> 20:12.748
And now we have three and four black authors on the New York Times best-selling list.

20:12.768 --> 20:13.669
I mean, it's unheard of.

20:13.769 --> 20:14.390
Routinely.

20:14.731 --> 20:15.211
Routinely.

20:15.432 --> 20:24.484
And part of it is the growing size of the black middle class, which is quadrupled since today Dr. King is still, doubling in the 80s alone.

20:24.920 --> 20:33.429
And the fact that 25 years ago, historically white institutions, such as Harvard and Yale, decided to integrate by race and gender.

20:34.230 --> 20:48.045
And now many of us who are beneficiaries of those affirmative action moves are now professors at those institutions and have integrated comparable institutions within the society.

20:48.685 --> 20:50.027
In 1969, I started Yale.

20:50.047 --> 20:51.248
So did Afro-American studies.

20:51.599 --> 20:53.683
1970, Cornel West started at Harvard.

20:53.984 --> 20:55.787
Twenty-five years later, we're back to your teaching.

20:56.268 --> 21:03.342
I mean, that's just symptomatic of a larger movement into the middle class by black people.

21:03.483 --> 21:09.675
I read in your book here, I didn't introduce John Edgar Wyden in a couple weeks ago, I just ran my piece two weeks or so ago.

21:10.347 --> 21:12.209
It's an extraordinary belief.

21:12.249 --> 21:15.393
He was only the second African American to win a Rhodes Scholarship.

21:15.413 --> 21:15.774
That's right.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.796
After Alain Locke in 1906.

21:17.997 --> 21:19.138
Locke is the first.

21:19.158 --> 21:22.202
And I said, my God, where have we gone in 25 years?

21:22.382 --> 21:23.644
It's astonishing.

21:23.724 --> 21:26.347
My senior year, four black guys got Rhodes Scholarship.

21:26.367 --> 21:27.409
It's amazing, isn't it?

21:27.429 --> 21:28.890
Yeah, it's amazing.

21:28.910 --> 21:38.042
And all this is part of, I don't know what the… Well, 160 million books you point out as well.

21:38.613 --> 21:41.476
Yeah, that's right.

21:41.496 --> 21:43.359
I mean, that's serious.

21:43.379 --> 21:48.545
Until recently, the American publishing industry didn't think that blacks bought books.

21:48.565 --> 21:54.391
Well, I mean, plus it certainly flies in the face of the whole question of literacy as well.

21:54.411 --> 21:56.974
I'm having a chapter, by the way, on this new book on literacy.

21:57.275 --> 21:57.675
Oh, really?

21:57.855 --> 22:00.759
And I did interview with Sapphire when she was here.

22:00.779 --> 22:01.459
Oh, yeah?

22:01.600 --> 22:02.781
I liked that book.

22:03.318 --> 22:04.019
I did, you know.

22:04.059 --> 22:05.540
Which one, her novel?

22:05.820 --> 22:07.582
Her novel, Push, yeah.

22:07.962 --> 22:13.968
I mean, as a middle-aged white guy, people would, I'm supposed to probably feel like the enemy of that.

22:13.988 --> 22:16.110
No, I excerpted it in my New Yorker.

22:16.130 --> 22:22.436
That's terrific, because the triumph of that book is that this girl learns to read.

22:22.496 --> 22:28.702
It's the awakening realization of literacy, and she really does dramatize this.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.203
And as Sapphire said, you know, she said,

22:31.381 --> 22:35.225
Let's be clear, two-thirds of African Americans are out of poverty.

22:35.305 --> 22:37.688
I think that's the figure she used.

22:37.808 --> 22:38.729
There's still a third.

22:38.969 --> 22:41.712
And that's what we're targeting now.

22:41.812 --> 22:47.858
I mean, I don't know where I'm going with this, but I think what you're saying is 160 million books.

22:48.038 --> 22:49.260
That's a lot of books.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.805
That's something that Norton and everybody else in America should be alert to.

22:54.025 --> 22:54.525
And they are.

22:55.646 --> 22:56.127
More and more.

22:57.408 --> 23:00.932
So it was an ideal time for this anthology to be published.

23:01.267 --> 23:08.578
You know, I'm going to use in my new book, I was not aware at all that Phyllis Whitley was examined by 18 people.

23:08.598 --> 23:09.038
Isn't that amazing?

23:09.058 --> 23:10.020
Where did you find that?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.502
It's in the preface to her book.

23:11.522 --> 23:12.383
They published the letter.

23:12.583 --> 23:16.790
The attestation that I quote is in the first page of her book.

23:16.810 --> 23:20.775
And I really love your trying to imagine what are they going to ask?

23:20.815 --> 23:21.577
What are they going to ask?

23:21.597 --> 23:22.939
It's like an oral exam.

23:22.959 --> 23:23.519
Who was Zeus?

23:24.140 --> 23:24.861
Who was Apollo?

23:25.402 --> 23:28.627
And apparently whatever the questions were, she passed.

23:28.647 --> 23:29.047
She passed.

23:29.068 --> 23:30.109
What a scene that is.

23:30.545 --> 23:32.147
It'd be a great scene for a movie.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.208
But the thing is, they couldn't believe her.

23:34.689 --> 23:36.791
Because she was an African.

23:36.811 --> 23:38.653
So that literacy has always been political.

23:39.153 --> 23:53.587
You know, despite the fact that I'm a formal critic and I love to analyze language use, it would be naive to say that the writings of blacks have not been judged politically since the beginning.

23:53.607 --> 23:54.027
They were.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.890
Phyllis Reed Wheatley didn't write about political themes.

23:57.308 --> 24:05.275
But ironically, hers was, in a way, the most political text of all, because it was determining if Africans were human beings or not.

24:05.715 --> 24:07.437
That's astonishing to me.

24:07.457 --> 24:09.338
And in fact, they didn't publish it here, did they?

24:09.358 --> 24:10.359
No, they published it in London.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.283
But imagine the pressure when you walked into that courthouse.

24:14.303 --> 24:18.546
Of course, Phyllis Wheatley was probably not thinking about all the Africans he was standing for, but she was.

24:18.987 --> 24:26.353
Well, I mean, but when you're the first, Wojcicki Parks probably didn't realize she was making a statement for everybody.

24:26.823 --> 24:37.514
Just quickly, I know you've been quoted on this euronics situation, I guess, today, as Oakland has started out there today.

24:37.594 --> 24:38.655
They backed off today.

24:39.036 --> 24:39.737
Did they back off?

24:39.757 --> 24:41.198
They backed off yesterday.

24:41.238 --> 24:42.259
They backed off.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.682
The Times said yesterday, or the 14th.

24:44.702 --> 24:47.625
I heard something on the radio coming in, I said, whatever.

24:47.645 --> 24:48.045
I don't know.

24:48.065 --> 24:49.467
But your attitude on this?

24:50.528 --> 24:53.491
I think it was wrongheaded and deeply misguided.

24:54.212 --> 24:56.374
I think the King's English is what we have to master.

24:56.725 --> 25:12.781
And when I say the King's English, I don't mean the great tradition of English literature and American literature only, but the tradition of Dr. King and the great oratorical tradition and the great tradition of writing by blacks and speaking by blacks in standard English.

25:13.181 --> 25:22.190
Why, the King didn't, you know, listen to I Have a Dream and I play it 20 times between now and Monday, and it's not about this and that and be that way sometimes.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.512
Shit, it's about standard English, and it's great.

25:24.532 --> 25:26.614
It's one of the greatest...

25:26.830 --> 25:28.612
acts of oratory in American history.

25:28.932 --> 25:31.035
I mean, the English language belongs to us, too.

25:31.635 --> 25:32.657
And we have a great tradition.

25:32.697 --> 25:48.355
And what I want to see is the Norton Anthology used as part of language training and literature training for inner-city black kids, so they can see that we have the vernacular tradition, but we also have the standard English tradition.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.738
And all black people have to be bilingual.

25:51.758 --> 25:55.723
You know, you have to be able to speak the language of the marketplace.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.131
speak black English at home.

25:57.151 --> 25:58.432
It's like Jewish people with Yiddish.

25:58.913 --> 26:04.097
You can't ask IBM to let Yiddish speakers, you know, in there.

26:04.418 --> 26:06.099
And in fact, Yiddish is disappearing.

26:06.199 --> 26:13.806
One of the great regrettable aspects of the assimilation of Jews in America is that Yiddish is a disappearing language.

26:13.826 --> 26:14.087
Sure.

26:14.387 --> 26:15.248
But it doesn't have to be.

26:15.268 --> 26:17.590
It doesn't have to be, which I write about in my book's book.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.632
Black English ain't even about to disappear.

26:19.932 --> 26:24.276
But what we need to do is to

26:24.796 --> 26:26.258
teach that bilingual.

26:26.278 --> 26:26.358
Wow.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.179
To make it easy.

26:27.980 --> 26:31.544
The Oakland School Board was desperate to get three quarters of a million dollars.

26:31.564 --> 26:32.325
And that ain't the way to do it.

26:32.345 --> 26:34.988
And they had to do it by saying this was a foreign language.

26:35.008 --> 26:39.634
And so they took the extraordinarily ridiculous step of claiming that it had a genetic base.

26:40.035 --> 26:48.465
The most ridiculous thing in a very bad report is that we learned this, we inherit this language genetically.

26:48.885 --> 26:51.508
Alaska people made theories like that were called Nazis.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.391
You know, this was just so wrong-headed.

26:53.411 --> 26:54.432
They had bad advisors.

26:55.002 --> 27:01.830
And I love the quote, today's canonical figures can often be in other generations amusing.

27:01.890 --> 27:12.601
It's true, and it means that we are, because, I mean, judgment is always time-specific, cultural-specific.

27:12.621 --> 27:20.971
So, you know, in 1855, if you'd ask a critic who's the greatest American novelist, they might have said Harriet Beecher Stowe.

27:21.351 --> 27:23.153
Nobody would say that today.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.385
She's still important, but not in a literary sense.

27:27.425 --> 27:28.286
Not in a literary sense.

27:28.787 --> 27:39.742
And so much of our anthology consists of writings by writers who are still alive or who have written since 1970.

27:39.762 --> 27:43.187
600 pages are our contemporaries.

27:43.708 --> 27:46.151
It's a horrible pressure to judge.

27:46.772 --> 27:48.795
And an important person in here is anonymous.

27:49.296 --> 27:50.617
Yeah, sure.

27:50.637 --> 27:53.501
I mean, because this is part of the tradition, isn't it?

27:53.522 --> 27:53.882
That's right.

27:54.149 --> 28:03.953
And you do use a comment that, I'm paraphrasing, but black people tried to write their way out of slavery.

28:03.973 --> 28:08.764
They tried to write their way out of slavery, alone among all the slaves in human history.

28:09.286 --> 28:11.972
These people created a genre of literature, the slave narrative.

28:12.695 --> 28:15.579
and use the tools of the master to dismantle the master's house.

28:15.599 --> 28:16.841
That's what they were trying to do.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.503
And, in fact, it was against the law.

28:18.523 --> 28:19.465
It was against the law.

28:19.685 --> 28:38.933
It was a criminal offense to allow black people to... What a more heroic story that a group of people from all over Africa come here, learn a new language, and then try to master that... On the one hand, but then it's also illegal to learn how to read.

28:38.953 --> 28:40.095
Oh, sure, it's illegal to learn.

28:40.115 --> 28:41.537
So they have to do it surreptitiously.

28:42.074 --> 29:00.281
And then pull that off, and using the principles of democracy and the tradition of English literature, try to indict their oppressors, establish their own humanity, and express just feelings about love and death and sorrow and anxiety that every human being feels.

29:00.802 --> 29:03.145
That is a great saga in the history of letters.

29:03.165 --> 29:03.746
It really is.

29:03.766 --> 29:05.429
I mean, it's a romance with books.

29:05.449 --> 29:07.051
Black people are people to book, too.

29:07.512 --> 29:11.558
And one of the great tragedies for me is that this generation...

29:12.044 --> 29:17.029
is not privy to that tradition, and so many of us have forgotten about that tradition.

29:17.450 --> 29:21.914
You know, we used to have people called elocutionists that would show up on Sundays in neighborhoods.

29:22.715 --> 29:31.384
I mean, you'd know they were coming, and they would read Paul Warren Thumbar and Langston Hughes and Booker T. Washington's speeches and stuff, and everybody would get dressed up, and you'd go and listen.

29:31.424 --> 29:32.865
That's wonderful, man.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.347
I mean, in the 50s, in the 40s.

29:34.367 --> 29:36.289
I mean, I saw it in the 50s.

29:36.970 --> 29:40.313
And now that's gone.

29:40.613 --> 29:43.477
I think the first literary society was founded in about 1830.

29:44.278 --> 29:47.662
We had literary societies before we had, we couldn't even buy books.

29:48.223 --> 29:56.153
There's a great book that Oxford published, I put it in my bibliography and I can't think of it right, but this fellow in Philadelphia who gets all the scrapbooks.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.376
Was it Jenner or any of that?

29:58.396 --> 30:00.799
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:01.167 --> 30:08.475
Nick Salvatore edited it from Cornell.

30:08.776 --> 30:11.419
I'm going to get your book, man.

30:12.099 --> 30:13.000
Maybe I'll send you one.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.081
How's that even be better?

30:14.102 --> 30:14.382
Okay.

30:14.902 --> 30:16.865
That's sweet, but I can go buy one.

30:17.285 --> 30:18.667
That's all right.

30:18.727 --> 30:20.028
Let me send you one.

30:20.108 --> 30:20.829
No, no, no.

30:21.089 --> 30:22.831
Listen, we're running out of time.

30:22.871 --> 30:25.014
You're going to call me on Monday.

30:25.234 --> 30:27.917
Okay, I will.

30:29.315 --> 30:31.617
I will call you, and we can chat a little further.

30:33.359 --> 30:34.399
Thank you for doing the story.

30:34.460 --> 30:36.802
Thank you for doing the book.

30:36.882 --> 30:37.342
How's that?

30:38.063 --> 30:41.025
Thank you.

30:41.346 --> 30:44.869
I've got the new book comproft that you've worked on as well.

30:44.949 --> 30:45.269
Oh, great.

30:45.289 --> 30:46.810
Do you want to make a comment on that?

30:46.951 --> 30:49.853
Oh, ask me about that on Monday.

30:49.973 --> 30:50.954
Oh, no, I will.

30:51.334 --> 30:53.116
I got one, I got one.

30:53.897 --> 30:57.600
To me, the Norton Anthology is to African-American literature as

30:58.137 --> 31:05.288
the dictionary of global culture is to what I hope will be a more sophisticated version of multiculturalism.

31:05.308 --> 31:24.197
I mean, our whole point was to say there are people everywhere who have mastered aesthetic forms and thought sublime and beautiful thoughts and have accomplished things which we think every educated citizen in the world should know.

31:24.698 --> 31:26.541
And I think more and more we have to think about

31:27.449 --> 31:32.339
I think it is inevitable that we will be training students to be citizens of a 21st century world culture.

31:32.921 --> 31:33.382
Thank God.

31:33.903 --> 31:42.441
Rather than merely our own little branch, and that's our, however flawed it may be, that was our, the gesture that we were trying to make.

31:42.481 --> 31:43.483
And I'll get this in the piece.

31:43.503 --> 31:44.345
That's why I mention it.

31:44.425 --> 31:44.886
That's great.

31:44.946 --> 31:45.728
I appreciate it.
