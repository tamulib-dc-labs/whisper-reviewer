00:02.191 --> 00:19.668
One of the earliest works, separate, you know, the pamphlet works about libraries in this country, I can't remember the exact title and date, but it was around 1831.

00:19.828 --> 00:23.251
It was published in Andover, Massachusetts.

00:24.112 --> 00:27.656
But for, you know, it's extraordinary.

00:27.676 --> 00:31.219
There's no copies here at Harvard.

00:31.908 --> 00:39.537
There were only two copies recorded in NUC, one at the Huntington Library and one at Knox College.

00:39.717 --> 00:41.940
Knox College.

00:41.960 --> 00:57.899
Now, they tried to get it on interlibrary loan from Knox College, which are interlibrary loan people here, and it was clear that the Knox College copy had been discarded.

00:58.420 --> 01:01.864
Why should they keep it, in a sense?

01:02.249 --> 01:07.174
But that meant that, you know, there was only one copy left.

01:07.795 --> 01:12.400
And it could very easily have been that there were no copies left.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.763
Because books end up in strange places.

01:15.003 --> 01:22.531
And, you know, this book would have totally disappeared because of it.

01:22.551 --> 01:24.053
If it weren't for the Huntington Library.

01:24.113 --> 01:25.995
If it weren't for the Huntington Library.

01:26.015 --> 01:27.156
Can you find the title?

01:27.237 --> 01:27.897
I can find the title.

01:27.917 --> 01:28.338
I like that.

01:28.598 --> 01:32.222
That's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about.

01:32.877 --> 01:37.702
You know, and Nick Baker out in San Francisco, you know, he found a couple of books.

01:38.143 --> 01:39.604
I've read his New Yorker article.

01:41.586 --> 01:42.127
Checked it out.

01:42.147 --> 01:51.197
These books, you know, aren't really, because you check OCLC and stuff and you see who has copies of various books.

01:51.217 --> 01:54.020
You know, you're down a half a dozen, five copies.

01:55.461 --> 01:56.783
It's happening more often than that.

01:56.803 --> 01:59.566
The British Library, they will say, last copy.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.888
You know, they clearly identify a book as a last

02:02.341 --> 02:32.263
copy of a book last you know we're getting to that aren't we but as you know I mean we know also that that books you know books are not just text books have all kinds of of other you know stuff with them

02:32.632 --> 02:36.136
that in a sense tells you how to read the book, isn't it?

02:36.377 --> 02:36.757
That's right.

02:36.777 --> 02:55.180
It tells you what you're going to get in that book, how to read the book, and, you know, so, you know, maybe, you know, they don't know that that copy, you know, that that last copy, that copy in that institution has the original body.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.944
They do that.

02:57.964 --> 03:01.508
They can't, there's no way they can tell that without, without,

03:01.876 --> 03:02.917
without writing.

03:03.618 --> 03:11.549
But there's an even more serious issue, I think, involved in this.

03:13.752 --> 03:27.630
The recon that is taking place is based on the idea of a hit.

03:30.254 --> 03:30.634
And

03:31.576 --> 03:34.499
And Recon being short for what?

03:34.519 --> 03:37.122
Retrospective conversion.

03:37.182 --> 03:42.127
Retrospective conversion of card catalog, about which Nicholson Baker also wrote.

03:42.167 --> 03:43.389
So hit meaning?

03:44.310 --> 03:48.394
Sometimes we go in and access the file or whatever.

03:48.994 --> 04:00.807
No, a hit in Recon would be, you know, if you have a given book and you find a record for it,

04:01.090 --> 04:13.787
in the OCLC database, that's a hit, and then that record in OCLC gets added to your file and becomes part of your catalog.

04:15.389 --> 04:21.838
And you and I would think that a hit would have to be exact.

04:22.499 --> 04:29.308
In other words, that if you have, you know,

04:30.908 --> 04:59.700
a work by let's say Harriet Beecher Stone if you have her Uncle Tom's Cabin with a date of 1869 that a hit would only be a record in OCLC that had the date 1869 and the same publisher and there was a true match

05:00.035 --> 05:05.482
It's not the first edition, though.

05:05.502 --> 05:08.807
Well, no, it definitely isn't the first edition.

05:09.027 --> 05:12.231
But somebody might think, what difference does it make?

05:12.372 --> 05:15.576
We have Barry and Peter Stowe, I guess.

05:16.437 --> 05:19.942
But a hit is not being defined as that exact match.

05:19.962 --> 05:23.747
A hit might be anything within a...

05:23.828 --> 05:27.953
I think it varies from library to library what the criteria are.

05:28.293 --> 05:32.337
It could be within two years of that date.

05:39.025 --> 05:45.032
If you think that that other institution has a copy of that book, you might be wrong.

05:45.092 --> 05:52.620
They might not have that book because their bibliographical file was in a sense corrupted by the

05:52.938 --> 05:55.080
the definition of hit.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.863
It's a complicated story.

05:57.883 --> 05:58.944
No, I like it.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.506
It's something to pursue, isn't it?

06:00.586 --> 06:00.866
Yeah.

06:00.987 --> 06:04.270
Who do you think I should talk to about something like that?

06:04.290 --> 06:07.013
Who would be eloquent on that?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.835
I haven't talked to anybody at OCLC yet.

06:08.855 --> 06:11.698
Maybe I should do that at some point.

06:11.718 --> 06:22.810
Well, as a matter of fact, that would be a fascinating part of your story, you know, really, because it's a great, you know, it's a great, you know,

06:23.212 --> 06:24.374
Anybody in particular?

06:24.414 --> 06:29.141
I don't know anyone there.

06:29.161 --> 06:33.467
I think so, because it is, you know, it's happening.

06:33.587 --> 06:34.869
It's a part of your story.

06:35.009 --> 06:38.254
It really is.

06:39.215 --> 06:51.733
And so, for a variety of reasons, you can't be sure that another institution has that book, and we

06:54.228 --> 07:03.581
has that book specifically that you're, I mean, it may have, you know, I assume we're talking Stowe, you know, Uncle Tom, 1869.

07:03.601 --> 07:05.344
Well, yeah, they might have.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.586
They might have.

07:06.606 --> 07:10.611
They might have Uncle Tom's Cabin from 1908.

07:11.653 --> 07:19.003
But maybe you're interested in that 1851 or 1852 or whatever year that it came out for various reasons.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.610
And as you point out, a book is more than just a text.

07:24.974 --> 07:43.371
And then there's, you know, bibliographers, of course, are keenly aware that copies of books vary in all kinds of ways.

07:43.391 --> 07:53.040
And that, you know, so that in destroying books, you're destroying some evidence that could be immensely useful.

07:53.898 --> 08:07.356
I'm hoping to do a chapter on bibliography again, but in something that the general reader, my reader, is more than Mr. General Reader, but anecdotally, we were very interesting.

08:07.597 --> 08:15.808
Father Boyle at the Vatican Library, I mean, they engage in a 200, 300-year project of a finest.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.432
They expect that that's how long it's going to take to do everything.

08:18.712 --> 08:19.934
It's fascinating.

08:19.954 --> 08:22.437
It's just on the very basis of business.

08:22.585 --> 08:22.946
Sure.

08:23.627 --> 08:24.989
You know, why?

08:25.169 --> 08:27.833
Why is this important?

08:30.577 --> 08:39.911
This Carol Fitzgerald that I wrote about in Gibrio that John Cole worked with at the Rivers of America, you know, she's, that's going to be another story.

08:40.151 --> 08:51.208
Audrey Hahnemann's work with the Hemingway, Gibrio, Michael Winship's work with the BAL and other things, you know.

08:51.492 --> 08:52.373
Very interesting.

08:52.993 --> 08:53.494
Yes, it is.

08:55.496 --> 09:00.320
The Mass Historical Society and the Adams family thing is quite an interesting story.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.902
That's going well into the next century.

09:03.022 --> 09:04.443
It goes on and on and on.

09:04.463 --> 09:04.724
Why?

09:04.824 --> 09:06.966
Why is it necessary?

09:07.186 --> 09:08.307
I don't know.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.650
Take the story wherever it goes.

09:12.070 --> 09:15.193
Want to go have a salad in the basement of the faculty club?

09:15.233 --> 09:16.574
That sounds terrific.

09:19.557 --> 09:21.178
It's where, you know,

09:21.631 --> 09:23.233
before they go to process it.

09:23.674 --> 09:26.637
But these are books that have been selected for self-control.

09:26.798 --> 09:29.000
For self-control, yeah.

09:29.020 --> 09:34.588
How does that other depository figure into the mix, the one that you did?

09:34.708 --> 09:35.469
Yeah.

09:35.929 --> 09:41.476
That was a real source of confusion with people.

09:41.777 --> 09:51.469
Those books have all been, most of them anyway, I think, have been moved up to the Harvard Depository because the

09:51.888 --> 10:03.723
So you're kind of withdrawing from that consortium, I guess?

10:03.903 --> 10:08.609
Well, I think that's a complicated consortium.

10:08.669 --> 10:13.255
I really don't understand.

10:14.365 --> 10:16.888
Now, these aren't books that are going to South Florida.

10:17.289 --> 10:18.951
These are just going for a part of Widener.

10:18.971 --> 10:22.336
No, some of these will go, but we're just going for a part of Widener.

10:23.978 --> 10:34.512
When you find, you know, empty shelves, safe on the shelves, it tends to mean I've, you know, been there.

10:35.393 --> 10:41.421
So, you said—I forget the precise number, but it was like a hundred thousand or so.

10:41.661 --> 10:42.162
Yeah.

10:42.749 --> 11:11.322
They are made title by title, even though they go into the thousands.

11:11.369 --> 11:27.546
That's right, but it's because it can be done very quickly, actually.

11:28.047 --> 11:40.920
If you're there, out in the stack, and you see two shelves of translations of milk,

11:41.727 --> 11:48.277
I mean, in a sense, I'm not making that, you know, looking at each one of those translations and making a decision.

11:48.637 --> 11:56.710
I'm simply making the decision that we don't need to have in here, in Widener, translations of Milton so that we can send them out.

11:58.172 --> 12:09.709
Or if you have six copies of a, six editions of a book, I'll look at them and choose, you know,

12:09.976 --> 12:15.124
which one or ones I figure need to stay and wind there, and then send the others out.

12:16.486 --> 12:21.814
So how much of your work week would you say you commit to this?

12:22.155 --> 12:33.773
Well, I'm theoretically half-time doing that, and half-time editing the Harvard Library Bulletin.

12:33.972 --> 12:37.156
But this is a primary duty, as we used to say it there.

12:37.697 --> 12:40.321
I decided not to neglect it.

12:40.401 --> 12:45.227
And let the bulletin, if anything, slide a bit.

12:45.248 --> 12:45.728
Yeah.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.172
Which, unfortunately, it does.

12:48.252 --> 12:50.375
It's a wonderful magazine, though.

12:51.636 --> 12:58.085
Well, we need this waiting.

12:58.125 --> 12:58.686
That's good.

12:58.946 --> 12:59.968
My wife will be happy.

13:00.228 --> 13:02.471
We get a little more than this.

13:02.591 --> 13:02.752
Yeah.

13:02.772 --> 13:03.793
Until after we've had none.

13:04.111 --> 13:06.675
That's right.

13:06.695 --> 13:06.955
Okay.

13:07.476 --> 13:24.242
All throughout the country, I was going to say particularly the Northeast, but I think all throughout the country, because this is a decentralized country, we don't have, it's not like France, not like England.

13:26.286 --> 13:31.013
All over, there are these small public libraries that have wonderful things.

13:31.448 --> 14:00.898
I went in, for instance, to the Somerville Public Library and went into their local history room, and there sitting on the shelves to which anyone could go, I thought it was anyone, you know, they didn't know me, was the records of a social library that had been founded in

14:01.537 --> 14:04.161
in 1820 or thereabouts.

14:04.241 --> 14:08.506
Manuscript, you know, list of members and so on.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.794
I could have walked off with it.

14:14.174 --> 14:20.182
And indeed, it's happening all over the country that people are walking off with it, that they're being lost.

14:20.222 --> 14:27.392
So that there's a, you know, we tend to think that in the large libraries we have

14:27.524 --> 14:41.638
everything, but there's all kinds of stuff that we don't have at all that is out in other smaller institutions because of the decentralized nature of this country.

14:42.498 --> 14:48.744
So it's a problem, and I don't see anyone, you know, thinking about it.

14:51.607 --> 14:54.930
To me, the Concord Public Library, I think I'll write about that.

14:55.271 --> 14:56.552
I love that library.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.161
small-town library.

14:58.341 --> 14:58.822
It's beautiful.

14:58.922 --> 15:01.704
It's got a tradition here.

15:01.724 --> 15:07.970
As recently as the 1960s, you know, they had Emerson as those.

15:08.511 --> 15:15.838
These are their own annotated books who are in general circulation.

15:15.858 --> 15:26.067
And, in fact, I think that is how Emerson's copy of Walden

15:26.418 --> 15:35.872
It was all set to be sold at auction, and then somebody determined that it actually belongs to the Concord Public Library.

15:36.914 --> 15:43.885
And I think it was the Concord Public Library that Bob Gross tells a story.

15:43.905 --> 15:45.066
Do you know Bob Gross?

15:45.727 --> 15:52.678
He's head of the program for the history of the book out at the Antiquarian Society.

15:52.996 --> 15:57.943
teaches down in Virginia, and has written about Conford.

15:59.425 --> 16:12.685
And he found that, and I think it was Conford, that had a set of the newspaper published in law in the 19th century.

16:13.586 --> 16:17.552
And he said that they got rid of it.

16:18.325 --> 16:33.726
Yeah, and apparently what they didn't realize was that they had it because Lowell, that newspaper, was the newspaper for the county of which Concord was a part.

16:33.746 --> 16:38.533
Well, I grew up in Lowell, and Concord's only eight miles away, so it's not that bad.

16:38.793 --> 16:40.475
Yeah.

16:40.495 --> 16:41.036
Sure.

16:41.056 --> 16:43.860
Yeah, and, but, you know,

16:44.296 --> 16:48.841
they saw it as not relevant to Concord because it was law.

16:49.162 --> 16:54.668
And I think he says they had the only complete set.

16:56.911 --> 16:57.251
Wow.

16:57.391 --> 17:02.798
Has he published this?

17:02.818 --> 17:07.703
I just did a piece on the AAS history of the book that I didn't talk about.

17:08.364 --> 17:09.345
I talked to Ed Charles.

17:11.668 --> 17:14.151
I sat in a couple of their seminars this summer.

17:15.177 --> 17:20.582
I do a call up to this Biblio magazine, and this next one coming up is on that very project.

17:21.783 --> 17:22.783
I think I'll give him a call.

17:22.803 --> 17:26.467
In fact, I'm going down to UVA in October.

17:26.487 --> 17:28.068
I'm getting a sign to Terry Bell.

17:31.711 --> 17:32.652
He's not at UVA.

17:32.712 --> 17:35.194
He's at the college down there.

17:35.214 --> 17:35.414
What's it?

17:35.434 --> 17:36.175
William & Mary.

17:36.215 --> 17:40.759
Oh, he's at William & Mary.

17:40.979 --> 17:44.762
I've met a fellow from William & Mary, but I think he's the librarian.

17:45.502 --> 17:50.467
at the Manuscript Society.

17:50.648 --> 18:05.384
Then you were teaching the history of libraries.

18:06.225 --> 18:11.510
At the University of Rhode Island Studgeon Program in Boston.

18:11.630 --> 18:13.973
I had

18:15.657 --> 18:30.735
the students do an assignment that they had to find a document relating to the history of libraries and make a presentation and give me a ten-page paper about it.

18:30.755 --> 18:44.010
And they brought in all kinds of documents.

18:44.395 --> 18:58.157
from their local institutions, sometimes, you know, manuscripts that obviously were not accessible to me here in the Harvard Library.

18:59.058 --> 19:09.795
And so it just, you know, confirmed the sense of mine about the riches that are in local institutions

19:10.096 --> 19:14.243
many of which actually throw away their stuff related to their own history.

19:14.804 --> 19:17.389
That's absolutely amazing, isn't it?

19:17.409 --> 19:19.793
Yeah.

19:19.813 --> 19:28.669
I wonder if the AAS had that newspaper, that Lowell newspaper.

19:28.689 --> 19:33.117
If AAS doesn't have it, then the chances are good that that will be gone.

19:34.126 --> 19:36.409
That's now a void, isn't it?

19:36.469 --> 19:37.009
That's right.

19:37.029 --> 19:38.231
That's a vacuum right there.

19:38.251 --> 19:39.712
It's a possibility.

19:40.233 --> 19:41.474
Who else would have it?

19:49.103 --> 19:53.748
So when you teach the history of libraries, is it strictly American or is it libraries?

19:53.768 --> 19:57.553
You start in antiquity?

20:00.416 --> 20:03.019
I did cover antiquity, but...

20:03.353 --> 20:24.763
and I I also tried to paint a picture of European libraries of the 16th and 17th and 18th centuries because I wanted to contrast that with American libraries.

20:24.783 --> 20:27.066
Why those three centuries in particular?

20:27.667 --> 20:31.352
Because it's in the 18th century that American libraries really got going with

20:31.872 --> 20:33.835
Benjamin Franklin.

20:33.855 --> 20:46.110
And I guess, you know, we had some, you know, obviously there was a Harvard library, you know, back before then, but it was pretty small potatoes.

20:46.431 --> 20:49.375
And there was Yale started at the 18th century.

20:49.395 --> 20:52.419
It was pretty small potatoes up until 100 years ago.

20:52.499 --> 20:52.919
That's right.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.621
Exactly.

20:54.721 --> 20:55.162
Exactly.

20:55.783 --> 20:59.027
You look at Farnham's survey of libraries,

20:59.648 --> 21:18.992
In the top five, I mean, he has the Athenaeum in there, he has the Library Company in Philadelphia, Library of Congress, Harvard, and I forget what the fifth one is, but, you know, I mean, where you have two private reading, you know, the Athenaeum and the Library Company are among the largest, and you're talking 200,000 bargains.

21:19.012 --> 21:19.512
That's right.

21:20.253 --> 21:20.814
Very small.

21:20.994 --> 21:22.196
So it was very, very small.

21:22.336 --> 21:22.616
Yeah.

21:23.377 --> 21:28.103
And so I wanted to contrast that with, you know,

21:28.302 --> 21:37.798
some of these large European libraries, you know, and just convey to the students that this was a poor country, you know.

21:39.782 --> 21:46.193
And I used to go

21:46.527 --> 22:04.328
I've been in European bookshops, walls lined with early books, fine bindings.

22:06.110 --> 22:11.556
You can't possibly find a room like that for American books, can you?

22:11.671 --> 22:18.819
You know, you get a few here and a few there, but we don't have that kind of richness.

22:19.059 --> 22:24.125
And yet, you know, we ultimately, of course, came to have great libraries.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.869
But it wasn't an organic process.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.531
No, it was explosive almost.

22:30.692 --> 22:36.639
Richard Landon up at the University of Toronto told me that it was extraordinary.

22:36.659 --> 22:39.282
And at the University of Toronto when he went through.

22:39.869 --> 22:47.959
when York University was founded in the 60s, I guess, up in Toronto.

22:48.620 --> 22:52.565
The way they... To build a library, that's interesting to me.

22:52.585 --> 22:55.388
When you have a new institution, how do they get books?

22:56.329 --> 22:56.810
What do they do?

22:57.231 --> 23:00.715
They came down here to Cambridge and they bought out Scar Bookstore.

23:00.995 --> 23:02.277
This is a university.

23:02.737 --> 23:03.218
Everything.

23:03.959 --> 23:07.243
And then they also went to a bookstore in Montreal and claimed him out.

23:07.392 --> 23:11.259
And that was their startup library at this university.

23:11.980 --> 23:12.501
Yeah, interesting.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.565
And I'm going to try and document that.

23:15.927 --> 23:20.556
It's one thing to say, and it's another thing to make sure it's going to happen that way.

23:21.357 --> 23:26.987
But what does that, you know, there was a page one story in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago about that...

23:27.305 --> 23:35.614
The Olin Foundation is going to establish a new college here outside of Boston.

23:35.634 --> 23:35.775
Right.

23:36.635 --> 23:38.177
What are they going to do for a library?

23:38.197 --> 23:39.359
Where are they going to get their books?

23:39.579 --> 23:42.142
But isn't that an engineering school?

23:43.543 --> 23:44.084
Yeah.

23:44.164 --> 23:51.953
Are they coming up here because they're close to MIT and they're close to Harvard, or is it strictly going to be what you can get off the Internet?

23:52.373 --> 23:52.754
I wonder.

23:52.974 --> 23:56.738
I bet it's going to be essentially what you get off the Internet.

23:56.971 --> 24:04.119
And for the sciences, libraries become increasingly less relevant.

24:04.139 --> 24:05.140
That's the way it's going.

24:05.380 --> 24:09.104
We've got college in Monterey.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.947
You know, this is amazing.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.569
That's another thing I'm going to do.

24:13.589 --> 24:17.893
I'm going to go out to California for a week next month because I want to go out of Monterey.

24:18.214 --> 24:19.155
Remember that big thing?

24:19.175 --> 24:22.999
They opened up the new school in Fort Ord, where Fort Ord used to be.

24:23.139 --> 24:24.160
It's part of the...

24:24.764 --> 24:29.459
California State System of the University of California.

24:29.479 --> 24:32.749
And there wasn't even a library in the plans.

24:32.999 --> 24:43.414
You know, then it was pointed out to them, you know, they didn't have a library, so they did something, and they do have a few books there now, but it was a technical engineering kind of a school.

24:44.155 --> 24:49.662
But books were largely deemed irrelevant to what this place was going to do.

24:49.722 --> 25:00.758
You're finding that, and that's why it's more than a curiosity that as you open these new buildings, like at the University of Michigan, it's not called a library.

25:00.898 --> 25:00.998
Yeah.

25:01.265 --> 25:03.892
It's called an information resources center.

25:05.577 --> 25:12.557
But it seems to me that the whole resonance of library is more than a place where you sell books.

25:13.027 --> 25:17.253
I think you would probably agree with that yourself.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.714
Am I right or am I right?

25:18.734 --> 25:19.616
Yeah, sure.

25:19.656 --> 25:20.857
There is a story to a writer.

25:20.877 --> 25:21.378
That's right.

25:22.499 --> 25:29.989
And it really bothers me when I see that the whole concept of the library is being treated in such a cavalier fashion.

25:30.009 --> 25:32.132
And this is something I want to address.

25:32.551 --> 25:41.905
So when I talk to somebody like Alberto Echo or Maurice Sendak or Stephen Jay Gould, you know, I mean, what is a librarian?

25:42.266 --> 25:47.874
You know, George Bernard Shaw, everything he knew he learned in the British Library.

25:47.954 --> 25:51.079
Virginia Woolf was totally the product of the reading.

25:51.099 --> 25:53.482
He never had any education outside of the home.

25:53.502 --> 25:54.804
He read her father's books.

25:55.646 --> 25:56.507
And Karl Marx.

25:56.767 --> 26:01.174
And Karl Marx, you know, developed his manifesto in the British Library.

26:01.323 --> 26:06.068
Did they tell you over in the British Library the story about Karl Marx?

26:06.088 --> 26:06.249
No.

26:06.309 --> 26:17.782
Apparently, the story as I hear it, as I recall it, is that he used to come in every day and take the same seat in the British Library.

26:18.503 --> 26:31.077
And years after he was dead, someone came in and asked an elderly woman who clearly would have been in the British Library at his time,

26:31.597 --> 26:36.186
and asked her, do you remember the man who used to sit at that table?

26:36.787 --> 26:39.853
He said, yeah, I do.

26:39.873 --> 26:54.921
He went away one day, and no one ever heard of him since.

26:54.901 --> 26:59.248
Where did you get that story?

26:59.268 --> 27:01.731
I don't know.

27:02.092 --> 27:04.576
But ask them in the British Library.

27:04.616 --> 27:06.939
Well, even if it's apocryphal, it's wonderful.

27:07.080 --> 27:10.405
I mean, I have no problem leaving apocryphal.

27:10.505 --> 27:12.127
How did you identify it?

27:12.147 --> 27:15.052
There was a thing on C-SPAN yesterday morning.

27:15.673 --> 27:18.577
People don't understand how the decision process works.

27:18.798 --> 27:22.984
And one of those who didn't understand was a member of the library committee who...

27:23.369 --> 27:25.632
who was a computer expert.

27:25.652 --> 27:27.775
He teaches computer sciences here.

27:28.476 --> 27:38.450
And he had developed an algorithm for choosing what books aren't used and should go out to the depository.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.836
And so he wanted to come in and see how I did it.

27:43.617 --> 27:46.361
So we went into the stacks and we worked about half an hour.

27:46.401 --> 27:52.870
And then he said, oh, you do it better than I can.

27:53.035 --> 28:14.117
because you take into account many more factors than I'm able to put into this algorithm, and you do it on the basis of information that is just not available to me, like the finding and the condition of the book, and the size, and so on.

28:15.198 --> 28:17.581
Do you have this in the thing that you're going to send me?

28:17.821 --> 28:18.702
No, I don't.

28:18.722 --> 28:19.142
You mentioned this?

28:19.162 --> 28:19.242
No.

28:19.302 --> 28:20.644
It's so important, isn't it?

28:20.664 --> 28:20.764
Yeah.

28:21.301 --> 28:23.404
Now, this happened more recently.

28:23.845 --> 28:25.747
Yeah, but this is where you have to be a book person.

28:25.807 --> 28:27.129
Yeah.

28:27.149 --> 28:28.692
And that's pretty important.

28:28.992 --> 28:29.733
Yeah.

28:29.813 --> 28:31.696
It's not really important, it's essential.

28:38.225 --> 28:46.617
There has just been published in English translation a book called Paratext by...

28:49.870 --> 28:54.416
Jeannette, French author.

28:55.197 --> 29:09.416
And what it is, Paratext is about all of those elements that are extra textual, that convey information about the book.

29:09.616 --> 29:10.518
Paratext.

29:10.678 --> 29:12.080
Yeah.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.702
And P-A-R-A?

29:13.942 --> 29:14.263
Yeah.

29:15.384 --> 29:19.810
And it's precisely that kind of information that...

29:20.583 --> 29:23.667
that I'm processing when I'm out in the stack.

29:24.188 --> 29:37.807
It's not, you know, you might think that I'm looking at text, but in a sense I'm looking at the paratext, because that tells me whether the book is a candidate.

29:38.188 --> 29:43.315
Yeah, sure, if you don't mind.

29:43.335 --> 29:49.223
This is the HD Transfer and Linkage Office, if that comes to it.

29:49.658 --> 29:53.042
It was kind of like a processing.

29:53.923 --> 30:08.340
Well, linkage has to do with—it's something that—it's some other process.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.002
It doesn't really have to do with HDH.

30:10.022 --> 30:14.788
It's just that the same people are doing this.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.752
But these are truckloads of books.

30:17.233 --> 30:17.894
This is a truck.

30:18.355 --> 30:20.958
Economics of Agriculture Production.

30:21.199 --> 30:25.084
Beef cattle, land use, part-time farming.

30:26.767 --> 30:29.591
And these look like they're pretty old, too, on top of all that.

30:30.833 --> 30:34.638
You know, these aren't exactly the kinds of things that somebody's going to be looking for.

30:34.939 --> 30:35.760
No, I don't think so.

30:35.780 --> 30:36.361
This afternoon.

30:36.882 --> 30:38.604
No, I don't think so.

30:38.985 --> 30:40.327
So they're going to go out there.

30:40.407 --> 30:43.932
And then they will be putting boxes out there and...

30:44.300 --> 30:45.622
store according to size.

30:45.682 --> 30:48.385
Now, you give it its barcode here, right?

30:48.425 --> 30:49.466
That's right.

30:50.427 --> 30:51.689
Exactly.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.691
And these came someplace out of Widener?

30:53.711 --> 30:55.593
Yes.

30:56.735 --> 31:00.359
And what will go into the shelf space that they have vacated here?

31:00.379 --> 31:01.540
Is that to be determined?

31:01.561 --> 31:11.252
Well, we have to send out enough so that we can begin to get large chunks of

31:11.772 --> 31:13.054
of empty shelves.

31:13.214 --> 31:14.435
It can't be one of two titles.

31:14.535 --> 31:16.137
It has to be... That's right.

31:16.257 --> 31:25.008
And then once we can get large chunks, then we can begin to reorganize the stacks in a way that makes more sense.

31:25.749 --> 31:32.917
For about a decade, all of the moves in the stacks had to do with how we could squeeze in more books.

31:32.937 --> 31:35.560
And there was someone who was very good at that.

31:36.141 --> 31:40.446
Managed to squeeze in an awful lot of books.

31:41.067 --> 31:47.314
Oh, my name is Charlie Montabano.

31:47.334 --> 31:51.258
So we need to get a fair chunk of space.

31:51.278 --> 31:53.501
So it's squeezing in individual books.

31:53.581 --> 31:58.466
It's making room for collections on a systematic basis.

31:59.727 --> 32:02.170
Yeah, and we need to have more room for the new books.

32:02.530 --> 32:03.652
And books are coming in.

32:03.692 --> 32:07.556
They continue to come in at an astonishing rate.

32:07.576 --> 32:08.597
I mean, I read the annual reports.

32:08.617 --> 32:10.399
You read the annual reports, yeah.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.253
They've got to go someplace.

32:13.274 --> 32:13.954
Exactly.

32:14.675 --> 32:16.757
They've got to go someplace.

32:16.937 --> 32:21.962
All of these trucks, I see about a half a dozen trucks, and this represents, what, a day's selection?

32:22.243 --> 32:31.492
Well, it takes me, you know, about an hour and a half to fill up the truck.

32:31.552 --> 32:38.179
Now, I've been on vacation, and these trucks actually, there were a couple here that weren't filled up by me.

32:38.259 --> 32:39.660
This one, for instance, was

32:40.602 --> 32:47.953
This has to do with some, you know, I guess Ukrainian literature.

32:49.956 --> 32:56.285
And it's actually published in Moscow.

32:56.986 --> 33:01.152
So maybe it's Russian.

33:01.433 --> 33:02.795
But it's all Russian.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.078
It's Cyrillic in any case.

33:05.298 --> 33:09.124
And there's a graduate student in Slovakia.

33:09.357 --> 33:24.376
We've been going through the stats and selecting in this particular area, but following guidelines that have been developed.

33:24.776 --> 33:37.913
What we do in literature is that when I first started out, I would go to encyclopedias and draw up a list of authors who were important.

33:38.635 --> 33:57.802
And then it dawned on me one day that what I was doing was really reinforcing the canon, and that I was shaping scholarship, but shaping it in a very traditional and conservative way.

33:58.063 --> 34:03.991
And so what I needed to do was to, you know, how else could I do it?

34:04.251 --> 34:07.236
Oh, did that concern you, that you were reinforcing the canon?

34:07.256 --> 34:07.576
Yeah.

34:07.897 --> 34:08.237
Why?

34:09.263 --> 34:11.405
Well, my wife's a feminist scholar.

34:15.048 --> 34:16.789
Your wife's name is?

34:16.809 --> 34:18.751
Mary Carpenter.

34:18.771 --> 34:21.293
And, you know, he was a daughter getting a Ph.D.

34:21.313 --> 34:34.584
in French literature who was working on French women authors of the 19th century that she'd found in the stats that you would not find mentioned in any encyclopedia.

34:34.905 --> 34:38.848
And so it really was, you know, reinforcing...

34:40.212 --> 34:49.222
I was preventing any possibility of, or virtually any possibility of discovery of new authors of importance.

34:49.683 --> 34:54.188
And that's always been a part of the process of scholarship.

34:54.648 --> 35:02.697
And so you're mindful of these things as you go through your journey.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.039
Oh, yeah.

35:04.179 --> 35:04.739
Oh, yeah.

35:04.799 --> 35:07.022
So this was one of those epiphanies while you were in there.

35:07.042 --> 35:07.402
That's right.

35:07.442 --> 35:08.323
So what happened?

35:08.343 --> 35:09.865
Well...

35:11.313 --> 35:12.375
to do, what to do.

35:12.835 --> 35:35.167
Finally, it occurred to me that even these canonical authors often were on the shelves with lots of their books unused or with editions of the books unused and so on, so that instead of bypassing those, I should send out some of the books of those people who are not going to be forgotten.

35:35.187 --> 35:37.170
You can get it back from the depository.

35:37.871 --> 35:40.915
And also keep on the shelves some

35:41.452 --> 35:44.035
at least one book of every single author.

35:45.457 --> 35:45.957
Interesting.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.881
And that's the way we do it now.

35:49.041 --> 35:49.902
Every author.

35:50.203 --> 35:52.946
Can you give me some specific examples?

35:53.607 --> 36:11.028
Well, I mean, it's precisely because I don't know these people's names, you know, but this student, when she went through, would have kept on the shelf, you know, here's Mikhailo Sabchenko.

36:11.048 --> 36:11.188
Mm-hmm.

36:11.675 --> 36:27.353
She would have kept some book of Mikhailo Sovchenko on the shelves of Widener, even though no one may.

36:28.093 --> 36:31.557
But you're talking about the canon in general, and you're talking about reinforcing the canon.

36:31.637 --> 36:35.742
You're talking about not just Western or Ukrainian literature.

36:36.245 --> 36:37.867
all of the different canons, I think.

36:37.987 --> 36:38.547
That's right.

36:38.567 --> 36:39.408
That's right.

36:39.428 --> 36:44.434
And, I mean, so we're now following the same policies, you know, in Danish literature.

36:44.454 --> 36:50.901
I mean, you mentioned Harriet Beecher Stowe earlier, so you keep up the top schedule, but her first book, I think, was a geography text.

36:51.321 --> 36:54.044
That might go out to herself, if you had it.

36:54.064 --> 36:55.085
Exactly.

36:55.245 --> 36:56.166
Exactly.

36:56.226 --> 36:59.550
That would be the kind of thing I think you're talking about.

36:59.890 --> 37:00.531
Exactly.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.994
You mentioned the Danish.

37:03.634 --> 37:14.846
Well, I mean, we now follow this policy with Danish and with, you know, Finnish and Latvian and Estonian and the whole world.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.650
Fascinating.

37:17.730 --> 37:28.001
There really is, because I am interested in this whole aspect of the Canada, and you say how you are really influencing the pursuit of scholarship.

37:29.883 --> 37:30.163
Yeah.

37:30.413 --> 37:37.162
in a real way, because if stuff isn't here to be discovered, then it won't be.

37:37.463 --> 37:37.903
That's right.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.887
So you have to know what exists in self for the ask part.

37:40.908 --> 37:41.388
Is that right?

37:41.428 --> 37:43.251
You have to know what exists.

37:43.271 --> 37:58.632
And so, you know, I try to send out, you know, you want to send out low-use stuff, too, but you want to send out low-use stuff that can be found.

37:58.831 --> 38:09.882
And so if a book has a highly descriptive title, it'll be more likely to go out to Southboro than a book that doesn't have a highly descriptive title.

38:09.902 --> 38:11.383
Again, this is part of the criteria?

38:12.084 --> 38:12.364
Yeah.

38:12.745 --> 38:15.227
I mean, you put that in there.

38:15.247 --> 38:19.931
Yes, yes.

38:20.232 --> 38:28.720
And then there's stuff that I keep simply because, and I don't know if this is in there, but it'll be stuff that I keep simply because

38:29.948 --> 38:35.636
I think that if I send this material out that it won't be used.

38:35.696 --> 38:57.407
For instance, anthologies, American anthologies, I keep them here because I think that people might want to use anthologies, look at a whole batch of them in order to see, well, you know, what was the taste in 1880?

38:57.725 --> 38:59.688
But you want to compare it, don't you?

38:59.808 --> 39:02.251
That's the only way it becomes meaningful.

39:02.932 --> 39:15.168
So I just think that if I don't use judgment in those ways, I'll be cutting off opportunities for the scholarship.

39:17.250 --> 39:20.975
That's really interesting.

39:20.995 --> 39:23.198
Yeah, it makes it fun, doesn't it?

39:23.959 --> 39:26.382
Very, very useful to me, really.

39:27.914 --> 39:28.475
Excellent.

39:28.615 --> 39:31.798
So this is the room D-N91.

39:32.278 --> 39:34.200
Where are we in there?

39:34.260 --> 39:35.281
What floor are we on?

39:35.321 --> 39:37.783
Well, we're in the basement.

39:37.923 --> 39:38.324
I see.

39:39.605 --> 39:41.947
There are no basement levels beneath us?

39:42.127 --> 39:50.815
There are none beneath us.

39:50.835 --> 39:55.660
As other kinds of space got used up, you know, more and more of the

39:55.977 --> 40:19.183
bathroom operations got moved down here, like conservation, and processing books for stories, microfilming, scanning, you know, the refrigerated things that might have gotten wet or something.

40:21.706 --> 40:21.866
Exactly.

40:21.886 --> 40:22.727
This is great.

40:24.985 --> 40:26.607
Thank you.

40:26.667 --> 40:29.850
This is the kind of thing I'm so excited about.

40:29.870 --> 40:32.332
I'll be transcribing it when I get home, you know.

40:34.274 --> 40:44.463
You see, the reason why I had the chutzpah to say I can solve the problem is because I've always spent a lot of time in the stacks.

40:44.483 --> 40:53.912
I'd come in, you know, Saturday, and I'd been working on, you know, I'd work on some bibliographical projects,

40:54.314 --> 41:10.452
And I'd get distracted and I'd go wandering down aisles of books so that I knew in a way that other people didn't that there was a lot of stuff here that we did not have to keep here.

41:10.853 --> 41:19.102
And this wasn't just, you know, dreamed up, you know, of a moment.

41:19.322 --> 41:22.566
I knew because of having wandered down those stacks

41:23.069 --> 41:23.890
that we could do it.

41:23.970 --> 41:28.237
And the greater the library, the easier it is to do, isn't it?

41:28.718 --> 41:45.926
Because you have, you know, soil conservation from 1920s, and you have, you know, two shelves of translations of Milton, and you have every collected edition of Shakespeare, and so on.

41:45.966 --> 41:49.752
So in a way, it's easier in the Harvard Library.

41:50.018 --> 41:55.210
than it is in many other libraries to do this kind of work.

41:55.230 --> 41:58.077
Excellent.

41:58.097 --> 42:06.036
I'd like to try to convey the extent to which a great library is a truly international collection of what was

42:06.488 --> 42:12.656
that you can study the cultures of the world in this book.

42:13.537 --> 42:15.480
And you can't say that about many libraries.

42:15.500 --> 42:16.722
You can't say it about many.

42:16.782 --> 42:31.501
You can go from the Caucasus in Armenia to ancient Greece to modern Greece to Lithuania, et cetera, et cetera.

42:31.701 --> 42:32.142
And that's

42:32.375 --> 42:38.646
the kind of thing that I think I'd like to try to convey to you in a tour if I've got the chance.

42:39.147 --> 42:41.792
Are you planning to be around?

42:42.233 --> 42:45.178
No big trips planned or anything?

42:45.218 --> 42:46.300
No.
