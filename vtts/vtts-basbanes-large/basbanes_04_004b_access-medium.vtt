00:03.102 --> 00:16.085
Actually, I've jumped ahead to 1965 and taken them the third revised and enlarged manuscript, and that's when Princeton gave me the contract.

00:16.206 --> 00:25.302
So you did two full manuscripts, actually a third manuscript before you actually even had a contract.

00:25.723 --> 00:27.085
The third manuscript, right.

00:27.588 --> 00:29.370
And that was a large one.

00:29.630 --> 00:34.336
Now, were they telling you after the first two that they'd probably do it, that they would do it?

00:34.356 --> 00:35.437
What kept you coming back?

00:35.677 --> 00:40.804
Let's say after the second one, they indicated an interest.

00:41.044 --> 00:52.077
And that was enough for me to get entree to a few places where the very fact that they had indicated that interest to get material I might not have been able to get.

00:52.517 --> 00:56.582
But they wanted this perfectly typed manuscript to photo offset.

00:56.917 --> 01:03.585
And, oh, I've always been so glad that I refused to let it, you know.

01:04.045 --> 01:05.707
So who was your editor at Princeton?

01:09.351 --> 01:10.292
Polly Hanford.

01:10.873 --> 01:12.094
Is Polly still there?

01:12.935 --> 01:19.583
Oh, I doubt it very much because she was, now see, that's 65, over 30 years ago.

01:19.934 --> 01:27.502
Her husband was a classicist, and she had absolutely no interest in Hemingway.

01:28.103 --> 01:37.654
She went through the whole manuscript and took out the commas, the serial commas, and then they decided they wanted them back.

01:38.174 --> 01:42.499
So then she went through it and put some of them back, and there were, oh...

01:42.968 --> 01:46.973
over a hundred that I had to put into the proof.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.496
So she had no interest in this.

01:49.516 --> 01:51.719
She was assigned to this task, then I gather.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.661
She was assigned to it, yes.

01:53.681 --> 02:02.032
And of course, a very sweet woman and, you know, just ever so nice.

02:02.593 --> 02:07.018
How is it, do you think, that Princeton decided to publish this?

02:07.302 --> 02:10.807
Oh, well, simply because on Carlos Baker's recommendation.

02:11.328 --> 02:15.214
So really, Carlos Baker played an essential... He did.

02:15.254 --> 02:16.195
He did indeed.

02:16.295 --> 02:28.934
I only... And then when I went down to... Flew down to Austin, to the University of Texas, and the director of the press there... This was before I'd signed the contract, of course.

02:29.795 --> 02:31.618
There, they wanted to publish it.

02:32.399 --> 02:35.183
But they talked...

02:35.433 --> 02:47.074
an addition of 500 copies, and I could have as many as I wanted, where Princeton had mentioned 2,500 copies for the first printing, and I could have 10.

02:47.935 --> 02:56.891
So that, naturally, I wanted it to have a wide... As wide a distribution as possible.

02:56.911 --> 02:57.492
Distribution...

02:57.995 --> 03:12.510
I even asked Vincent, the editor there, Marian Brookhoff, the director, later she was the director, if they had ever considered doing the paperback.

03:13.411 --> 03:20.939
And, no, no, that wouldn't have... So how many copies did they print of the bibliography?

03:21.920 --> 03:25.504
Let's see, I have the bibliography right in front of me, and...

03:27.172 --> 03:33.501
Let's see, the first printing was 2,500, and then they did a second printing in 1969.

03:34.242 --> 03:39.529
Excuse me.

03:39.549 --> 03:40.911
2,380 in 1969.

03:41.171 --> 03:43.855
Okay, and the first printing was what year?

03:44.336 --> 03:46.659
The first printing was 1967.

03:46.679 --> 03:49.062
Okay, so that sold out pretty good.

03:49.480 --> 03:59.551
So that, and then by 1969, then they did a second, and then the supplement in 1975, they printed 2,532 of it.

03:59.571 --> 04:00.192
2,00532.

04:00.212 --> 04:07.460
Mm-hmm, of the supplement.

04:07.480 --> 04:17.631
But then it went out of print before the, it went out of print in 1989, and then the bibliography went out of print in 1995.

04:18.623 --> 04:21.969
1985, the supplement went out of print before?

04:21.989 --> 04:22.950
1989.

04:24.553 --> 04:26.597
And then the actual bibliography?

04:26.857 --> 04:28.760
Went out of print in 1995.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.485
And how many sold?

04:31.745 --> 04:33.949
Did they ever have anything beyond the second printing?

04:34.351 --> 04:35.553
Not of the supplement.

04:35.573 --> 04:41.801
So actually, it was in print, though, from 1969 to 1967 to 1995?

04:42.622 --> 04:42.883
Uh-huh.

04:43.824 --> 04:43.984
Wow.

04:44.004 --> 04:44.825
That's amazing.

04:45.506 --> 04:48.851
But it took them 30 years to sell those 2,300 books?

04:49.832 --> 04:51.214
No.

04:51.354 --> 04:53.457
Oh, oh.

04:53.878 --> 05:00.907
From 1969 to 1995, it took them 27 years, or whatever that is, to sell 2,380 books.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.029
Right.

05:02.988 --> 05:15.746
It had a good, and of course, then I'd get, you know, one half of, I mean, well, that's another story.

05:16.247 --> 05:20.873
Well, but I am interested in this because clearly you didn't do this for any kind of money that you might have made.

05:20.933 --> 05:22.495
Oh, no, no.

05:22.736 --> 05:27.342
I mean, I can't imagine that you made more than $15,000 or $20,000 on this if you made that much.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.534
You know, I've never tallied it.

05:29.915 --> 05:34.000
But Mary Hemingway was concerned that I thought I would make money from it.

05:36.303 --> 05:39.848
You know, that I'd be... Profiting on her husband.

05:39.888 --> 05:43.333
But I had never planned, I never expected to.

05:43.633 --> 05:50.983
You know, people told me that scholarly writing, you know, you didn't do it for monetary incentives.

05:51.183 --> 05:59.333
But I told Mary that the royalties would surely, this would be in like 1966 or something, 65.

06:00.754 --> 06:11.848
And I remember telling her that the royalties would surely be enough for me to go to Paris and see all the places mentioned in, you know, in his books, and the sun also rises in a movable feast.

06:11.868 --> 06:15.011
And they were, and I did, and I went over by myself in 1969.

06:16.633 --> 06:19.637
So that, and of course walked the,

06:20.123 --> 06:20.984
The left bank.

06:21.044 --> 06:23.527
So what kinds of places did you see?

06:23.547 --> 06:24.949
Oh, I saw all of them.

06:24.989 --> 06:43.953
You know, where Gertrude Stein had lived, where the, what is it, Luxembourg Gardens, where the, you know, the Hemingway addresses and that, where I had known he lived.

06:43.973 --> 06:49.860
And I had to have CafÃ© au lait at the, what is it, the...

06:50.431 --> 06:58.383
D-E-U-X-M-A-G-O-T-S, and just that kind of, you know.

06:59.484 --> 07:03.450
And were you mindful that, well, this is my reward?

07:03.470 --> 07:06.334
I was indeed, yes.

07:06.595 --> 07:12.844
Yes, I was very, very pleased to finally see it all.

07:12.864 --> 07:14.987
Well, whose idea was it to do the supplement?

07:16.115 --> 07:31.172
Oh, Princeton came up with, uh, uh, Marion Brokaw at Princeton wrote me, um, oh, like 1970, and, um, and asked for, uh, you know, if I could update it.

07:31.913 --> 07:35.897
Now, they didn't expect what they got.

07:36.298 --> 07:40.823
They thought it was just going to be a thin little, a thin little book that would, uh,

07:41.005 --> 07:45.890
you know, encouraged sales for the first book.

07:46.671 --> 07:49.574
But it didn't end out that way.

07:49.635 --> 07:56.142
It ended out, you know, to be a fairly sizable, as you know, a fairly sizable book.

07:57.083 --> 08:10.017
But at that same time, you know, that's something else about... I had contributed a 24-page Hemingway addenda to...

08:10.267 --> 08:15.352
to Matt Bruckley and Frasier Clark's 1970 Fitzgerald Hemingway Annual.

08:16.213 --> 08:20.356
And then they wanted me to continue doing that.

08:20.997 --> 08:36.952
But then when Princeton requested a supplement, and I had this very demanding job at McGraw Hill working under constant deadlines, they were very disappointed when I didn't continue.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.333
I met

08:39.089 --> 08:39.930
Charlie Mann.

08:41.791 --> 08:42.012
No.

08:42.192 --> 08:45.014
Special collections librarian at Penn State.

08:46.156 --> 08:46.876
I don't know him, no.

08:46.896 --> 08:52.982
He introduced me to Matt Bruckley at an annual meeting of the Bibliographical Society.

08:54.163 --> 08:57.346
They used to hold him at the Morgan Library, and they still do.

08:58.227 --> 09:02.430
And Bruckley's first question was, what university did you attend?

09:03.752 --> 09:04.933
Oh, dear, my book's going.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.375
So wait, what did you...

09:09.481 --> 09:10.182
And what did you say?

09:10.242 --> 09:21.218
And when I said I hadn't gone to college, he steps back and says real loudly, you're self-educated.

09:21.238 --> 09:23.462
I felt like I was some kind of rare species.

09:28.269 --> 09:33.837
Tell me what a bibliographer has to do to really succeed in bibliography.

09:34.077 --> 09:34.598
I'll tell you.

09:35.139 --> 09:35.600
Just a moment.

09:35.620 --> 09:36.501
Hold on just a moment.

10:04.983 --> 10:11.351
What a bibliographer has to do is she has to have access to collectors.

10:13.895 --> 10:25.429
And everyone told me that without Marky Cohen's collaboration that no one could do a Hemingway bibliography.

10:26.551 --> 10:33.640
And I'd already bought her husband Louis Henry Cohen's 1931 bibliography of his work.

10:35.240 --> 10:39.486
But I went, this is quite a kind of a detailed story, do you mind?

10:39.506 --> 10:40.307
No, please, go ahead.

10:41.508 --> 10:48.858
So, I don't even, I doubt that she's still living, I don't know.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.602
No, Margie Cohn has been dead for some time.

10:51.842 --> 10:53.264
I would imagine.

10:53.484 --> 10:55.907
She got actually hit by a bus in England.

10:56.568 --> 10:57.710
Oh, for God's sake.

10:57.830 --> 11:00.133
Yeah, this was about eight or nine years ago.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.512
Oh, for goodness.

11:01.532 --> 11:04.456
Yeah, she was in England, and she was looking the wrong way, you know.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.399
Oh, my.

11:06.780 --> 11:07.901
Yeah.

11:11.666 --> 11:14.951
That happened to McGraw-Hill authors?

11:15.031 --> 11:17.834
In fact, it's in my book someplace.

11:18.475 --> 11:18.916
Is it in?

11:19.096 --> 11:21.319
Yeah, it's either in the index.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.284
I think Margie Cohn is listed in the index, and I think I tell that.

11:26.226 --> 11:26.486
I do.

11:26.506 --> 11:30.171
In fact, I give a citation for her obituary and everything in there.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.369
So she should be in the index.

11:32.710 --> 11:33.751
Now how could I miss that?

11:35.934 --> 11:36.795
It's there.

11:37.055 --> 11:42.963
But anyway, I will... So how did you get to meet Margie Cohn?

11:44.305 --> 11:50.232
So anyway, I'm told that no one can do it without her cooperation.

11:50.633 --> 11:56.260
So when I told her what I was working on, her response was, not another.

11:56.594 --> 12:01.202
She asked me if I had any idea how many people took up her time with that idea.

12:01.222 --> 12:03.466
Of doing a Hemingway bibliography.

12:03.486 --> 12:07.232
She said everyone expected access to her husband's books and papers.

12:08.775 --> 12:11.559
To her, to Margie Cohn's husband's books.

12:11.619 --> 12:12.901
To Louis Henry Cohn's.

12:12.921 --> 12:13.082
Right.

12:14.003 --> 12:15.346
Yeah.

12:15.486 --> 12:17.950
Because he had a pretty extensive Hemingway collection.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.214
Oh my, he had a beautiful collection.

12:20.234 --> 12:20.374
Mm-hmm.

12:20.675 --> 12:30.326
And then when I told her, you know, what I'd done so far, she said that, you know, I should have examined the first editions first and left all that until later.

12:30.707 --> 12:34.211
Well, what I've already told you, working here in Kansas City, I wasn't, you know.

12:34.912 --> 12:39.377
And so then... So in other words, you did the later editions first, is that right?

12:40.038 --> 12:40.418
I did.

12:40.438 --> 12:41.940
So you worked backwards.

12:42.681 --> 12:47.627
And I guess it would be called that, but I did it in...

12:48.164 --> 13:05.647
I mean, see, you know, I... Well, I did it because of what I was doing, the biography, you know, leading to the bibliography, so that I didn't do the... You know, didn't examine the books until later.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.550
Now, what, did you collate one edition against the other?

13:08.591 --> 13:10.193
Oh, yes, often.

13:10.573 --> 13:13.297
And how did you determine what the points were?

13:15.039 --> 13:17.462
Well, now, of course, see, then for the...

13:19.653 --> 13:31.507
through Farewell to Arms, of course, I had the benefit of his books.

13:31.527 --> 13:43.602
And then Berg Library, Berg Collection, excuse me, the Berg Collection had those early first editions, and I could then

13:43.852 --> 13:55.428
you know, compare what he had, you know, checked all those against what he had, and then from then on, you know, move on from then.

13:55.449 --> 13:57.892
Now, wait a minute, now you're saying collate.

13:57.912 --> 13:59.795
Now, you're saying page by page collation?

13:59.815 --> 14:01.257
Yeah, you didn't do that kind of stuff.

14:01.557 --> 14:02.519
No, I didn't.

14:02.539 --> 14:05.623
No, I didn't mean to infer that.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.558
Imagine how a computer would have helped you.

14:10.761 --> 14:11.862
Wouldn't that?

14:11.882 --> 14:12.643
Absolutely.

14:13.224 --> 14:17.529
Today you can just do a computer search for things and you can find things and it's amazing.

14:17.789 --> 14:26.960
So Margie realized I wasn't a potential customer and she said she had no reason to help me to make anything available to me.

14:27.841 --> 14:33.248
So I should have been discouraged but

14:33.413 --> 14:34.374
I wasn't.

14:34.394 --> 14:37.439
She'd lift item after item out of her file cabinet.

14:37.839 --> 14:39.882
I was just sitting there, frankly salivating.

14:40.303 --> 14:43.567
I wanted to see them so bad, and she just, you know, lifted them out.

14:43.868 --> 14:44.669
Have you seen this?

14:44.709 --> 14:45.590
Have you seen this?

14:45.610 --> 14:49.435
And, of course, hadn't seen any of them.

14:49.896 --> 14:52.139
Now, what are these kinds of things that she's pulling out?

14:52.780 --> 14:58.628
Oh, like, is it Der Spiegel?

14:59.367 --> 15:24.244
article, the issue, you know, when he committed suicide, and the contract with Boney and Livride, and what's some of the others, something by Gustav Regler that was prefaced, but just, and so I went around the corner to, I went around to a

15:25.372 --> 15:50.518
coffee shop and oh I filled notes pages and notes with with the things that she had mentioned, but you know but hadn't let me let me see, so about a it was almost a year later exactly a year late, and I wrote her that I had made several recent research trips and when I was down at the University of Virginia, C. Waller Barrett had asked if I had examined her husband's collection

15:50.887 --> 15:56.615
And David Randall asked me the same question when I was at the Lilly Library at Indiana University.

15:57.476 --> 16:13.759
So then she wrote me that I could come into her apartment one evening, and this time then she pulled the books from the shelves and let me examine them, and a large scrapbook which Captain Cohen had assembled and yielded a number of great articles.

16:14.941 --> 16:15.021
Hmm.

16:15.305 --> 16:21.273
And I stayed until about midnight, and the evening ended with a pleasant chat about her friendship with P.S.

16:21.293 --> 16:22.655
Eliot and his wife Valerie.

16:23.456 --> 16:27.161
And she showed me some of the, she collected books where she and Louis were mentioned.

16:28.043 --> 16:32.148
So then, and then it wasn't, can I tell you something off the record?

16:32.168 --> 16:32.409
Sure.

16:32.789 --> 16:40.620
It wasn't until my second visit, and she revealed that she had consented to help me, because if she refused, quote, they would call her a bitch.

16:40.600 --> 16:51.672
So that it was just a case of, you know, some of her collectors, important customers, I should say.

16:51.692 --> 16:52.473
Saying to help you.

16:52.493 --> 16:57.678
They were willing to help me and thought she should.

16:58.579 --> 17:05.747
She even went so far as to try to get someone out, a professor, she never told me his name, to...

17:06.588 --> 17:17.738
He had just finished a bibliography, she said, and to get him to do the Hemingway, a Hemingway bibliography, and he refused unless I abandoned mine.

17:20.020 --> 17:20.761
Isn't that something?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.365
So somebody else quit because you were doing yours.

17:25.385 --> 17:26.706
It was very decent of him.

17:27.407 --> 17:35.194
But see, at this point, Mary Hemingway, Scribner's, and Carlos Baker were all...

17:36.372 --> 17:45.446
To an extent, well, yes, they were all helping me so that they were engaged.

17:46.608 --> 17:51.416
Did you exchange a lot of letters with them, with Baker and Mary Hemingway?

17:53.098 --> 18:04.236
Mary Hemingway I visited at the apartment, and she told me immediately that she couldn't help me because she didn't know anything about bibliography.

18:04.503 --> 18:11.775
But, of course, she did help me because she let me see the books that they had brought up from their home in Cuba.

18:12.516 --> 18:17.525
And some of those were edited editions.

18:17.926 --> 18:20.590
You also attempted to do all the foreign editions, too, right?

18:21.952 --> 18:23.595
I did.

18:23.615 --> 18:25.759
And, of course, the anthologies.

18:26.219 --> 18:30.747
All the 40 or so libraries, I would always check their...

18:31.267 --> 18:42.000
for the anthologies, and then at the Library of Congress, I had great... At what point did you feel that you had it pretty well put together?

18:42.020 --> 18:58.860
Oh, I didn't really ever, but Carlos Baker told me that I should simply decide on, like, it ended up being 1966, I think, and stop.

19:00.308 --> 19:01.610
And that's it.

19:02.352 --> 19:16.196
William White gave me the good advice of whatever format I chose to be consistent, and Carlos Baker gave me the advice that at some point I should stop.

19:18.981 --> 19:22.587
So are you still looking for things even though you stopped 30 years ago?

19:23.022 --> 19:24.103
Oh, no, no.

19:24.244 --> 19:32.113
It's only when I get the book catalogs that I receive that I... And you find things that should be in there, right?

19:33.315 --> 19:33.495
Right.

19:33.675 --> 19:35.057
What kinds of things do you find?

19:35.097 --> 19:39.342
Can you think of the kinds of things that you find?

19:39.362 --> 19:49.755
Oh, I just keep, you know, put them in folders.

19:50.157 --> 19:56.844
you know, the new books that come along, when letters come up, when anything comes up at auction.

19:56.884 --> 20:15.504
And I went to, one of the things I was going to tell you about, because you mentioned George Lowry, I believe you do a new book, went to, attended a great series on rare books that he moderated at the New School back in 1977.

20:16.085 --> 20:18.207
And it was...

20:18.676 --> 20:20.098
delightful.

20:20.258 --> 20:23.462
I always continued going there.

20:23.482 --> 20:28.588
I went there to hear Anthony Burgess, and afterwards I introduced myself.

20:28.688 --> 20:47.350
He had, I kept seeing an announcement that he, this is when I was working on a supplement, and I kept seeing an announcement that a book was coming out about Hemingway, so he expressed admiration for the bibliography, which pleased me enormously, and

20:47.701 --> 20:48.505
Let's see.

20:48.928 --> 20:54.859
Well, anyway, I did continue evening, you know.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.181
You know what I suggest?

20:56.381 --> 20:58.744
Why don't we take a little break right now, and I'll call you back.

20:59.184 --> 21:01.226
I think it's an excellent idea.

21:02.127 --> 21:10.596
We had a lovely, lovely California trip, but in Monterey I did get a bit of a head cold, and you can hear I'm kind of sick.

21:11.697 --> 21:12.518
Would you do that?

21:12.538 --> 21:12.798
Sure.

21:13.499 --> 21:15.181
When would be good for you?

21:15.781 --> 21:19.405
Oh, now, are you saying half an hour?

21:19.986 --> 21:21.387
How about another hour?

21:21.552 --> 21:23.356
Is that okay with you?

21:23.396 --> 21:25.261
Be fine.

21:25.281 --> 21:28.609
I told my daughter I'd help her with something and she just came home from school.

21:29.311 --> 21:31.295
And I need about an hour with her.

21:31.335 --> 21:33.220
Oh, do take it.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.608
So how about if I call you back at about 4.30?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.476
Let's see, are you saying your time?

21:38.536 --> 21:40.338
Yes, that would be 3.30 your time.

21:40.839 --> 21:41.680
Oh, that would be fine.

21:42.261 --> 21:45.306
Okay, so it's about 2.20 out there right now, right?

21:45.687 --> 21:46.448
Very good.

21:46.468 --> 21:50.253
So why don't you just take a little break, and I don't think we have that much more to go.

21:50.294 --> 21:52.096
I think maybe another half an hour or so.

21:53.538 --> 21:55.722
I've got some more here about Mary.

21:56.263 --> 21:56.884
Good.

21:57.464 --> 22:00.088
Well, let's pick up with Mary when I call back.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.010
Okay.

22:01.050 --> 22:01.711
Okay?

22:01.731 --> 22:02.372
Very good.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.153
Okay, good.

22:03.173 --> 22:03.994
I'll see you in a little while.

22:04.195 --> 22:04.435
Right.

22:04.535 --> 22:04.776
Bye-bye.

22:04.916 --> 22:05.076
Bye-bye.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.581
We're going again.

22:07.322 --> 22:09.966
And I have your bibliography right here, believers.

22:10.847 --> 22:14.773
Now, can I tell you a couple more things about Margie?

22:14.793 --> 22:15.294
Please, yes.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.218
And then I've got some notes here on Mary.

22:18.538 --> 22:18.879
Okay.

22:18.899 --> 22:34.641
But when you were saying about what a bibliographer needed, and I said to be in touch with Hemingway collectors, and of course Margie Cohen put me in touch with several, and most notably Jonathan Goodwin.

22:34.908 --> 22:39.955
His collection was auctioned, well, I guess it's been some years now.

22:40.055 --> 22:41.958
I gave Tom the catalog.

22:42.579 --> 22:53.474
But I took an early train up to Hartford, and he had brought in some important items into his office, and I worked under pressure.

22:53.574 --> 22:57.700
I worked without a lunch break until the office closed.

22:57.940 --> 23:01.185
But it was just great because he had a lot of the

23:01.418 --> 23:10.491
Oak Park High School newspapers that I hadn't seen before, but he didn't want to be acknowledged.

23:11.052 --> 23:20.265
He said he was already receiving too many book catalogs, but he wrote me a lovely letter after the book came out.

23:21.006 --> 23:30.700
But in July of 1966, now the manuscript's almost ready to go to Princeton, and Mark Cohn wrote me,

23:30.933 --> 23:39.465
that several people had asked her if I was going to start where her husband's bibliography left off, you know, after A Farewell to Arms.

23:40.006 --> 23:41.648
I mean, I was just amazed.

23:42.229 --> 23:48.538
So anyway, I reminded her we had discussed it one evening in her apartment, and I was under the impression she had agreed.

23:49.119 --> 23:54.426
I mean, the usefulness of my bibliography required that I start at the beginning of Hemingway's work.

23:54.963 --> 23:55.824
Can you imagine?

23:55.844 --> 23:56.786
That's amazing, yeah.

23:56.806 --> 23:59.189
Isn't that amazing?

23:59.269 --> 23:59.610
Yeah.

23:59.970 --> 24:13.690
That she would, what's it, yes, that, Nicholas, in late December, 1967, I went up to House of Books, and I had the extreme thrill.

24:13.790 --> 24:22.142
She had, oh, three or four stacks of my bibliography there, over 30 copies, you know, from individuals.

24:22.242 --> 24:22.722
She did.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.565
For me to inscribe.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.428
How do you like that for a turnaround, huh?

24:27.869 --> 24:30.192
Oh, yes, yes.

24:31.574 --> 24:33.477
Just so gratifying.

24:33.698 --> 24:40.027
And, of course, so worthy, you know, the letters I received.

24:40.047 --> 24:42.872
One of the books that I inscribed that day went to Donald St.

24:42.952 --> 24:43.332
John.

24:43.833 --> 24:49.061
He and his wife, Ruth, owned the carryback books in Franconia, New Hampshire.

24:49.081 --> 24:53.067
And they were in Italy at the time, and he had Margie send...

24:53.283 --> 24:58.010
He had her hold the other book, but he had her send mine over.

24:58.891 --> 25:03.357
And I hope to have a pleasure someday of showing you the letter he sent from there.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.480
It is just priceless.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.902
That's great.

25:06.922 --> 25:07.563
It really is.

25:07.583 --> 25:09.105
Now, I have a question.

25:09.165 --> 25:22.243
Now, these various categories, the A, B, C, D, are these your designations, or do these follow any kind of a... Like, you go all the way up to H, newspaper, periodical, material on Hemingway.

25:22.223 --> 25:29.892
Were these categories that you designated or are these more or less standardized?

25:30.533 --> 25:41.126
Princeton, when I went to the press, and they had published Ford, Harvey's rather, Ford, Maddox, Ford.

25:41.146 --> 25:45.351
So they gave me a copy of that to use as a guide.

25:45.411 --> 25:48.315
And then I studied a number of other bibliographies.

25:48.633 --> 25:58.590
And I simply adapted those categories that I needed to fit what I was doing on Hemingway.

25:58.610 --> 26:00.754
You know, like some of them didn't have anthologies.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.737
Some didn't have foreign translations.

26:03.498 --> 26:05.562
Some didn't have holdings of letters.

26:05.980 --> 26:19.579
And then I did that survey of 55 libraries for their holding, and I think I must have gotten 95, 98% response.

26:20.540 --> 26:23.905
And I just had to...

26:24.593 --> 26:38.137
to kind of find, you know, to find the format that, and of course, like everything, each book would require its own format so that... Excuse me, Ms.

26:38.378 --> 26:39.820
Audrey, just a second.

26:40.001 --> 26:41.203
My daughter's got a problem here.

26:41.223 --> 26:42.986
Just one, will you forgive me just a second?

26:43.587 --> 26:44.188
Go ahead.

26:54.057 --> 26:54.758
Okay.

26:54.778 --> 26:56.059
I told them the whole story.

26:56.079 --> 26:56.179
Okay.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.040
I'll see you in a bit.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.301
But everything's okay now.

26:59.362 --> 26:59.523
Yeah.

26:59.563 --> 26:59.663
Okay.

26:59.683 --> 27:00.443
I'm sorry.

27:00.463 --> 27:01.404
My daughter hears that.

27:03.226 --> 27:04.888
No, no.

27:04.968 --> 27:06.169
Just all night.

27:06.389 --> 27:08.772
She's 14 and they're having their tests now.

27:09.553 --> 27:11.395
Oh, of course.

27:11.515 --> 27:12.255
End of the term.

27:12.416 --> 27:12.576
Yeah.

27:13.176 --> 27:13.657
I'm sorry.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.297
Okay.

27:14.378 --> 27:18.922
But I do owe you a thanks because yesterday I reread Donald St.

27:19.082 --> 27:20.824
John's letter and some of the others.

27:21.209 --> 27:25.476
that I received after the bibliography was published, and they are so gratifying.

27:26.017 --> 27:31.387
I mean, people were just so, oh my, they're just so kind.

27:31.427 --> 27:36.315
And, of course, the reviews were excellent, especially William Nolan's.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.632
in the Los Angeles Times.

27:39.153 --> 27:40.334
I'll send you a copy of that.

27:40.354 --> 27:48.924
Yes, I'd like to actually see anything that you care to... For me, I like as much material as I can get.

27:49.024 --> 27:54.330
It was reprinted in the European Herald Tribute.

27:54.350 --> 27:54.870
Oh, it was?

27:54.991 --> 27:58.655
And Mary Hemingway saw it when she was in Spain, and she sent it to me.

27:59.315 --> 28:05.222
Of course, my favorite is the one that Tom sent you, the London Times Literary Supplement.

28:05.303 --> 28:07.671
Well, Tom didn't send me that, actually.

28:07.711 --> 28:08.674
He didn't send your answer?

28:08.694 --> 28:09.798
No.

28:09.818 --> 28:10.962
Oh, I thought he sent his letter.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.269
I have a letter here, and he sent me something.

28:13.891 --> 28:15.938
So actually, all I have is his letter.

28:16.593 --> 28:19.656
I don't have anything published, as a matter of fact.

28:19.716 --> 28:21.798
I could send on both of those then.

28:22.539 --> 28:23.600
Okay.

28:23.620 --> 28:24.060
Yeah.

28:24.120 --> 28:28.424
All I have here is he sent me some other material on another subject entirely.

28:28.825 --> 28:29.125
Right.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.768
Soldiers of the Sea, U.S.

28:31.788 --> 28:36.072
Marine Corps, but I have really nothing here.

28:36.352 --> 28:39.915
I'm glad I spoke of it then.

28:40.216 --> 28:42.338
Yeah, I know.

28:42.598 --> 28:42.718
Right.

28:42.698 --> 28:44.200
I certainly will.

28:44.480 --> 28:51.449
I'm very happy to spread the good... What he does is he quotes from part of it here.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.891
Oh, maybe that's it.

28:53.192 --> 29:00.160
Yeah, he just says, he mentions, he said the review dated August 1st, 1968, read in part.

29:00.201 --> 29:02.083
So he quotes from it.

29:02.323 --> 29:02.864
That's right.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.227
Yes.

29:05.848 --> 29:08.011
He quotes two paragraphs from it.

29:08.491 --> 29:10.274
He quotes from that.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.216
But I will...

29:12.449 --> 29:18.116
I will send the Xerox of that and William Nolan.

29:20.899 --> 29:35.276
Let's see, and you were saying about, you said something about... Well, designating these categories, you know, like for collectors and booksellers, they will say that's an A item, a B item, a C item.

29:35.296 --> 29:35.997
Oh, yes.

29:36.638 --> 29:36.898
Yes.

29:37.139 --> 29:40.903
But now simply to...

29:42.520 --> 29:56.218
you know, so that the index, see the index, if you notice, I think, wait a minute, let me look at my own index, is not by page number, it's by item.

29:56.839 --> 30:03.027
Yeah, it'll see E, well, I think, that's right, it says E28F21C

30:03.597 --> 30:04.719
And then 81.

30:04.959 --> 30:13.514
That's why I had, and who I got that from, I couldn't tell you.

30:13.995 --> 30:17.381
But I guess it almost has to be that way.

30:17.841 --> 30:25.875
You can't just send somebody page 344 and have them hunting out on the whole page to see the one item that they...

30:26.176 --> 30:54.428
that they want to now you never imagined that it would be this this this uh huge uh an undertaking no no not at all um and i hope i'm i hope i've given you a clear picture of how it did involve uh evolve excuse me how it evolved uh because uh as you can see i never uh i never thought that i would end up doing uh

30:56.551 --> 31:05.261
Well, let's just say, you know, I didn't expect to ever do it.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.964
I'm still a little amazed.

31:09.326 --> 31:14.391
Charlie Mann said that I was the first woman to do a bibliography of a major literary figure.

31:15.132 --> 31:17.515
Now, I haven't checked that out.

31:17.675 --> 31:18.576
The first woman?

31:18.758 --> 31:19.619
Uh-huh.

31:19.899 --> 31:23.203
To do a bibliography of a... That's what Charlie told me.

31:23.343 --> 31:24.345
Now, who's Charlie Mann?

31:24.565 --> 31:29.711
Charlie Mann, he was the librarian of special collections at Penn... Oh, you mentioned that, yes.

31:29.731 --> 31:29.871
Uh-huh.

31:29.891 --> 31:31.733
He was a good friend of the Goldwaters.

31:31.853 --> 31:37.440
I worked there, I believe I told you, for Eleanor Goldwater at the Corner Bookstore on Ross Avenue.

31:38.081 --> 31:40.303
She specialized in cookbooks.

31:40.323 --> 31:47.972
And then her husband, Walter Goldwater, had a bookstore on University Place.

31:48.290 --> 31:52.434
And they were very good friends of Charlie's.

31:52.454 --> 31:59.041
And so that I met him after the, I believe, after the bibliography.

31:59.061 --> 32:02.965
He was very, very helpful with the supplement.

32:02.985 --> 32:05.608
Sent me information.

32:06.309 --> 32:09.973
I have to think, though, have you read everything that Hemingway wrote?

32:11.514 --> 32:13.116
Oh, let's say...

32:15.408 --> 32:20.333
I mean, certainly not literally, but let's say virtually, you know?

32:20.813 --> 32:29.221
And if there is, I'm not sure what it would, no, I wouldn't have read all these.

32:29.241 --> 32:34.967
Well, I would have read them in byline, whatever the Toronto dispatches were.

32:36.408 --> 32:37.369
Can't think offhand.

32:37.389 --> 32:41.213
But do you think you know him very well now from having gone through all this stuff?

32:41.412 --> 32:43.474
Do you think you know him as an individual at all?

32:44.275 --> 32:46.717
Or is he still kind of this distant writer?

32:47.318 --> 33:02.894
Considering that this was all 30 years ago, but you might notice in the first paragraph of my preface, and I called Hemingway the greatest writer of the 20th century.

33:03.975 --> 33:09.681
Well, I had planned to write the most influential writer of the 20th century.

33:10.319 --> 33:17.086
And to use a lovely quote by, oh, it's Lewis, somebody, and I cannot think of his last name.

33:17.566 --> 33:24.033
Anyway, perhaps you've even heard it, that half the young writers tried to imitate him and the other half tried not to.

33:24.093 --> 33:26.175
That's right.

33:26.195 --> 33:28.037
I've heard that quote, yeah.

33:28.057 --> 33:29.198
But I can't think of Lewis.

33:30.560 --> 33:38.588
Well, anyway, but at the time I was working on the preface, in the preface of a biography of Faulkner,

33:38.956 --> 33:43.824
And the biographer claimed Faulkner was, quote, the greatest writer of the 20th century.

33:43.984 --> 33:50.434
And I read that, and I decided that all he was giving was his opinion, and I could give mine.

33:50.715 --> 33:54.501
Well, do you believe that he's the greatest writer of the 20th century still?

33:58.827 --> 34:02.653
If not the greatest, certainly one of the top greatest.

34:02.794 --> 34:04.637
I would not put Faulkner ahead of him.

34:04.717 --> 34:06.820
I would not put Fitzgerald ahead of him.

34:07.188 --> 34:14.633
I'm not that familiar with a lot of the European writers.

34:17.463 --> 34:19.189
Who would you put ahead of him?

34:19.658 --> 34:20.539
Well, I don't know.

34:20.659 --> 34:26.005
Myself, I'm a big Faulkner fan myself, but that's a... Are you a Faulkner fan?

34:26.025 --> 34:28.268
But I have a lot of Hemingway First Editions.

34:28.288 --> 34:29.148
Did you ever collect?

34:29.168 --> 34:31.611
Did you ever become a collector during all of this?

34:32.332 --> 34:34.434
No, I truly didn't.

34:35.055 --> 34:48.670
I was lucky to be given some old little ephemera, different things, say, that Matt Bruckley and Frasier Clark...

34:49.122 --> 34:53.748
had printed little limited copies, but no.

34:54.169 --> 34:59.336
No, I never had the wherewithal to enter into that at all.

35:00.277 --> 35:03.401
I don't recall that I ever bought a thing from Morgan.

35:03.922 --> 35:05.424
He used to love that.

35:05.444 --> 35:13.434
But do you also point out that this in no way was ever intended to be a descriptive bibliography or a textual bibliography, I guess?

35:13.454 --> 35:15.417
See, that came in with the

35:15.599 --> 35:22.530
about the collation, where you said, ask me if I, yes.

35:23.551 --> 35:39.396
It just, there was just so much that I didn't go beyond what I felt was necessary to the

35:40.523 --> 35:57.291
Hemingway scholar, student, well, maybe not scholar, but say student, book dealer, aficionado, and so that I did not do that.

35:57.912 --> 36:00.777
But...

36:03.052 --> 36:04.053
Let's see.

36:04.093 --> 36:14.924
Does it please you when you see, for instance, you'll see at a book, I don't know if you ever get to see any of these booksellers' catalogs, but they will say Hahnemann X number.

36:15.004 --> 36:18.047
You know, they'll cite you, and it happens all the time.

36:18.928 --> 36:27.216
Or such and such a book, and it'll be, they'll say Hahnemann page or whatever, D. That happens all the time, you know, of course.

36:27.236 --> 36:31.020
And I love it.

36:31.040 --> 36:31.320
I'll be frank.

36:32.279 --> 36:33.561
I really do.

36:33.661 --> 36:54.271
But what I like even more is when, in acknowledgments, in books about Hemingway, the way, and of course the way Carlos Baker did it, and the way, well, with the Hemingway manuscript, that's the, I treasure my inscribed copy of that.

36:55.994 --> 37:02.083
You know, Charles Mann and Philip Young worked there in the, in the,

37:03.987 --> 37:14.444
Mary lived in a penthouse there at the big blue building at 65th and Madison, and she kept the papers in the safe deposit boxes in the bank on the first floor.

37:15.105 --> 37:21.716
And that's where Charlie and Philip Young worked on the Hemingway manuscripts, and I was able to identify some of the fragments.

37:22.417 --> 37:24.561
But to...

37:24.997 --> 37:31.788
The way they acknowledged my health and all, oh, that's ever so gratifying.

37:31.808 --> 37:33.450
Now, who published, which book is this?

37:33.971 --> 37:41.063
Oh, that's the Hemingway Manuscripts that Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania published.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.064
U-Pen or Penn State?

37:43.026 --> 37:43.326
Right.

37:44.027 --> 37:45.410
University of Pennsylvania?

37:45.450 --> 37:48.254
Penn State, Penn State University.

37:48.535 --> 37:49.997
Okay.

37:50.037 --> 37:52.000
Pennsylvania State University.

37:52.132 --> 37:52.833
press, right?

37:53.614 --> 37:53.755
Uh-huh.

37:53.775 --> 37:55.257
How long ago did they do that, I wonder?

37:56.138 --> 37:58.763
I'd have to go over and look at that.

37:58.783 --> 38:00.345
Well, that's okay, but it's some time ago?

38:00.385 --> 38:03.631
But they actually published the manuscripts?

38:04.292 --> 38:13.026
No, they just published the list of what went to the Kennedy Library, the manuscripts.

38:13.046 --> 38:13.887
Oh, I see.

38:14.812 --> 38:16.394
listed the manuscripts.

38:16.915 --> 38:28.991
But see, she had all these little scraps and all these little fragments and parts, and then of course she had that ghastly Garden of Eden that they published.

38:29.372 --> 38:39.165
And I was able to tell, I did not get to the fall, but Charlie Xerox, some

38:39.550 --> 38:58.776
and then I was able to tell them what issue, what Hemingway article in Esquire that the fragment came from or what, you know, what other periodical that was, I just, you know.

39:01.780 --> 39:04.484
Have you ever been to the Kennedy Library here in Boston?

39:05.044 --> 39:05.445
Yes.

39:06.586 --> 39:07.768
Joe August.

39:08.103 --> 39:23.182
She sent me an invitation, and Marge and I went up for a session and for the conference the evening that they had the dedication of the Hemingway Room, very July, 1980.

39:23.202 --> 39:29.229
And I was so sorry, Mary Hemingway was ill, and she was unable to attend.

39:29.870 --> 39:33.294
But I met a number of professors who had written works on Hemingway.

39:33.635 --> 39:34.836
I met Michael Reynolds.

39:35.170 --> 39:43.218
Princeton University Press had asked me to do the reader's report on his Hemingway reading, and he was just ever so nice.

39:43.538 --> 39:44.359
Well, they all were.

39:44.399 --> 39:46.061
They were just so complimentary.

39:46.481 --> 39:55.610
They said it was more interesting talking to me than any of the accomplished fashion admin, which, of course, pleased me, and it was meant to.

39:55.890 --> 40:01.476
So this becomes a legacy of viewers, doesn't it, this book, this project?

40:02.917 --> 40:03.878
It does.

40:04.094 --> 40:24.988
it certainly in in a sense uh-huh it's something that has given me no it gives me enormous satisfaction to have have done it i've i've written a lot all my life but it's the only public my only published work besides what i

40:25.407 --> 40:28.711
what I did for the Fitzgerald Hemingway annual.

40:29.311 --> 40:33.676
And this gives me a lot of satisfaction.

40:33.696 --> 40:36.099
You know, you mentioned foreign translations.

40:37.501 --> 40:39.423
Let me tell you my most delightful experience.

40:39.843 --> 40:49.454
I was at the New York Public Library there, you know, along the wall in the reading room, and I was having trouble figuring out an entry in a Greek reference book.

40:49.474 --> 40:54.840
So I asked an elderly man who was working in the area, and he looked at it and he said,

40:55.040 --> 40:56.522
the sun comes up, too.

40:57.443 --> 41:01.508
And I thanked him, and he said, that means something.

41:01.528 --> 41:06.154
He looked so bewildered.

41:07.035 --> 41:08.557
Oh, goodness.

41:08.657 --> 41:11.661
Oh, that's funny.

41:11.821 --> 41:17.267
You can see, I just was interested in absolutely every phase.

41:17.648 --> 41:18.909
Where did you take your notes in?

41:19.070 --> 41:21.773
I mean, in journals and notebooks?

41:22.613 --> 41:28.241
when you were working in the field like that, because you really didn't have Xerox machines available to you, did you?

41:28.642 --> 41:32.867
Well, I did in a lot of cases, yes, in the libraries.

41:32.888 --> 41:50.933
Now, I didn't like, you know, when I was working under such pressure with collectors' copies and all, but I did do a lot of Xeroxing, and I did a great, great many notes,

41:51.419 --> 42:04.348
And, uh, but just, uh, just in notebooks, like in, uh, shorthand, uh, I don't take shorthand, but, I mean, I do not write in shorthand, but, um, in shorthand, uh, uh,

42:05.662 --> 42:06.484
What am I trying?

42:06.504 --> 42:06.944
Notebooks.

42:07.285 --> 42:08.086
Yeah.

42:08.106 --> 42:09.850
Yeah, because they're not signed.

42:10.190 --> 42:11.753
How many notebooks do you think you filled?

42:12.334 --> 42:13.396
Oh, I couldn't tell you.

42:13.717 --> 42:14.999
I truly couldn't tell you.

42:15.580 --> 42:16.121
Hundreds?

42:16.241 --> 42:20.669
I've simply discarded all of that so long ago.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.954
You didn't throw that stuff away, did you?

42:23.274 --> 42:24.216
Oh, absolutely.

42:24.597 --> 42:25.358
You did?

42:26.553 --> 42:27.134
You did?

42:27.174 --> 42:29.957
How could you check on something to make sure it was right, though?

42:30.457 --> 42:35.823
It never occurred to me that that, I mean, as long as it was in, it's in the book, it's there.

42:36.124 --> 42:49.118
Now, it's true that the letters that I gave to, the very large box of letters that I gave to, well, it wasn't, it was like, you know, where you get a... Where is that?

42:49.499 --> 42:53.303
Say a ream of paper, that size box, to Maryland.

42:53.722 --> 43:20.573
Now, I noted that, you know, there were some letters where they mentioned Hemingway items that I had been unable to find, and there were even, although I think I've kept all where there's been, where anybody has noted an omission, but...

43:22.038 --> 43:26.484
Let's see, I was going to tell you something more about Mary.

43:27.405 --> 43:28.627
Oh, yes, yes.

43:29.108 --> 43:46.071
She was, although she claimed early on that she couldn't help me, she invited, I was up there a number of times, and she invited Marge and me for tea and to a large party honoring Frank Church, and she was really ever so nice.

43:46.439 --> 44:07.806
But I was so tickled when Andreas Brown, owner of Gotham Bookmark, I don't know if he still is, but he told me that when Mary was going to Australia and she was planning on stopping in the Crimea in order to get Hemingway's royalties, you know, they won't, you know, you have to go there to get anything.

44:08.406 --> 44:09.628
At least she did at that time.

44:10.088 --> 44:14.674
And she phoned him and asked where, she phoned Andreas,

44:14.992 --> 44:18.836
and asked where she could find evidence of what had been published in Russia.

44:19.616 --> 44:22.339
And he told her, it's all there in Hanneman's Hemingway.

44:22.819 --> 44:26.463
And he said, after a dead silence, she says, it's right here on my desk.

44:28.084 --> 44:29.225
That's a great story.

44:29.286 --> 44:33.109
And she's the one that didn't want you to make any money on it, right?

44:33.630 --> 44:34.751
Well, no, no.

44:34.991 --> 44:35.772
She was afraid.

44:36.192 --> 44:37.253
She was afraid I was in.

44:37.593 --> 44:38.334
No, no, no.

44:38.394 --> 44:39.075
I didn't mean to see.

44:39.115 --> 44:40.596
I obviously misspoke.

44:41.257 --> 44:42.518
Well, she was concerned.

44:42.852 --> 44:52.325
was that I was going to be in for a big shock, that this wasn't going to earn me a whole lot of money, you know, becauseâ Oh, I see.

44:52.345 --> 44:52.625
I'm sorry.

44:52.645 --> 44:53.386
I misunderstood.

44:53.626 --> 44:53.907
Yes.

44:54.287 --> 44:55.389
See, I'm glad that came up.

44:56.731 --> 45:08.927
You know, like, because there wereâaround that time, she was suing Hotchner forâ or trying to hold up his book or something, and there was all so much money that heâ

45:09.278 --> 45:12.062
that he made from, what was it, Papa Hemingway?

45:12.082 --> 45:12.763
She was tough.

45:13.644 --> 45:14.586
I mean, Mary was tough.

45:15.147 --> 45:15.928
Yes, she was.

45:17.109 --> 45:22.037
Excuse me.

45:22.057 --> 45:26.103
And she was concerned.

45:32.151 --> 45:38.661
She was concerned that she... See, and then Charles Scribner had...

45:39.721 --> 45:48.594
They had only printed Lee Samuels the Hemingway checklist in 750 copies.

45:48.654 --> 45:56.125
And he thought that that was about the limit of a Hemingway bibliography might sell.

45:57.207 --> 46:00.732
See, because if only that many people were buying that.

46:01.373 --> 46:08.243
And so he apparently had said something to her, and she in turn was warning me

46:08.527 --> 46:18.277
And, of course, I hadn't really, I mean, never gave that aspect of it that much thought.

46:18.297 --> 46:21.320
They didn't understand I was doing something I loved doing.

46:21.420 --> 46:31.830
I was fascinated by every time a footnote that I hadn't checked, you know, and then I could check it out.

46:32.011 --> 46:38.517
And every time I found something, when I found something new that hadn't been listed,

46:38.885 --> 46:40.168
by anyone before.

46:40.208 --> 46:44.558
So that, anyway.

46:44.578 --> 46:50.953
So did you ever, were there ever any great surprises or was it just kind of long, steady, hard work?
