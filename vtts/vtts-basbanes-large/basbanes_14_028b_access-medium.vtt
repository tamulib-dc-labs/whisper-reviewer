WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:09.033
Well, I think the book which was written in the most manuscripts in the world, I think.

00:09.053 --> 00:10.514
Yes.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.557
As well as in Latin, in other words.

00:14.658 --> 00:17.341
You know, I sort of found liturgies.

00:17.941 --> 00:29.753
Everything here, everything here is about, it's religious.

00:29.773 --> 00:30.253
Everything is religious.

00:30.273 --> 00:30.814
So what do you actually do?

00:31.975 --> 00:40.567
There is one which, I don't know which one it is, 10.0, 10.0, 10.50, 11th century.

00:41.869 --> 00:46.555
But I will show you, I will say, a small book.

00:49.459 --> 00:50.581
A small book.

00:52.443 --> 00:58.692
We have a cabinet, by the way, which ends at 1560, 100.

00:59.347 --> 01:07.436
It was died in 1924 by a monk here, together with another monk who became a bishop in Paris, and they make it together, and it's called Arcadius.

01:07.456 --> 01:09.037
And this is the one which we are using now.

01:09.398 --> 01:11.560
Of course, it's very amateur.

01:11.580 --> 01:14.483
Yeah, it's good, but not for the today's standards.

01:15.264 --> 01:25.315
Another change of the generators.

01:25.455 --> 01:26.676
Good to have with my fries later.

01:26.716 --> 01:28.138
Yes.

01:29.266 --> 01:32.389
Now, I think this is the 13th century.

01:32.409 --> 01:34.471
We have the music and the words as well.

01:36.193 --> 01:48.405
And it's called Stichirarion, which means it has hymns which are chanted in vespers and muttons as well.

01:49.626 --> 01:50.447
May you call it again?

01:50.707 --> 01:51.348
Vespers.

01:51.368 --> 01:52.109
Another book.

01:52.129 --> 01:53.330
Stichirarion.

01:53.350 --> 01:57.034
Let me show you exactly how it is.

01:57.054 --> 01:58.395
Stichirarion musicus.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.932
Maybe you can write it down for me.

02:15.310 --> 02:15.650
Thank you.

02:18.233 --> 02:23.860
Now, this is the kind of, you know, one of the manuscripts.

02:23.992 --> 02:29.657
Now, bear in mind in many, many, many scripts you may find many works, not just one, because sometimes they were compiling them.

02:30.598 --> 02:35.723
So whatever number that is, exactly, the correspondence, so that's 1499.

02:35.943 --> 02:40.727
You can go here and find 1499, and here it is.

02:42.809 --> 02:52.598
And the people who did this catalog in 1924, Metropoliton, Sophronios, and

02:53.017 --> 02:57.644
Yaron, it's a monk, Arkadius, but it was done in Paris.

02:59.127 --> 03:05.297
Greece was very poor, especially in the north, because the text left only in the 12th century, 1912.

03:06.679 --> 03:09.043
The south was in a better shape.

03:09.063 --> 03:19.800
And it says that it's for the whole year round, and it tells some information, like who are the poets.

03:19.949 --> 03:24.095
And it gives us, these are saints of the church as well.

03:24.475 --> 03:25.136
St.

03:25.417 --> 03:27.299
Germanos, patriarch of St.

03:27.319 --> 03:27.620
Louis, St.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.083
John of Damascus, very famous.

03:30.263 --> 03:32.066
Ephraim, Karias.

03:32.086 --> 03:32.947
That's very extensive.

03:33.448 --> 03:34.789
And it gives you blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:34.809 --> 03:37.012
It tells you everything, everything, blah, blah, blah.

03:37.032 --> 03:38.675
And then it gives you how many pages.

03:38.895 --> 03:40.838
Now, not pages, but leaves.

03:41.198 --> 03:41.418
Leaves.

03:41.659 --> 03:42.600
Leaves.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.302
And then it tells you when it was finished.

03:45.404 --> 03:47.627
Up, 1292.

03:48.907 --> 03:51.851
And even gives you the month and the day.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.295
Wow, that's a terrific catalog.

03:55.317 --> 04:01.005
And so it's quite old, you know.

04:01.025 --> 04:03.769
But as I said, now they're making it comprehensive.

04:03.809 --> 04:05.832
It gives you all the measures.

04:06.033 --> 04:06.473
That's right.

04:06.493 --> 04:07.735
It's awesome.

04:07.755 --> 04:08.557
It's good.

04:08.577 --> 04:09.758
It has a few mistakes.

04:09.798 --> 04:11.281
Sometimes the number doesn't match.

04:11.421 --> 04:13.564
Sometimes...

04:14.219 --> 04:23.712
The good thing, one good thing, and we are proud of that, and we thank God for that, is that we haven't lost any manuscript since this was put together.

04:25.494 --> 04:33.505
In the past, perhaps, but since this was put together, actually we have increased 500 manuscripts.

04:33.525 --> 04:33.765
Wow.

04:34.026 --> 04:39.433
It stops, let me give you exactly where it stops, and I will tell you from 24,

04:43.042 --> 04:44.424
Here they have also indexes.

04:44.464 --> 04:46.387
You see, 1536.

04:47.148 --> 04:54.038
Today I'll give you the latest.

04:54.058 --> 05:10.281
One nine, two, one nine, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

05:11.003 --> 05:12.905
Miley is the other one.

05:12.925 --> 05:14.086
Maybe someone's using it.

05:14.106 --> 05:14.967
No, no, no, no.

05:15.007 --> 05:18.691
Someone here, because I was working here and I have made the numbers.

05:18.711 --> 05:21.934
These are my letters, I know.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.857
1800s, you can see here.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.101
We discover them later.

05:28.121 --> 05:29.642
So that book goes up to what number?

05:29.662 --> 05:30.603
15 something?

05:30.984 --> 05:31.524
1536.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.126
1536.

05:33.647 --> 05:34.808
Whereas we have now 2050.

05:34.828 --> 05:39.913
Well, that was in 1924.

05:40.315 --> 05:41.276
Mm-hmm.

05:42.138 --> 05:45.523
So since 1924, you've added close to 500 more.

05:45.924 --> 06:01.508
And so, yes, and we have books also.

06:02.169 --> 06:04.693
I don't know where they are.

06:05.053 --> 06:05.614
That's some interesting.

06:06.303 --> 06:09.367
Now, there is another kind of Auschwitz.

06:09.387 --> 06:16.737
As we said, here we have patristic and classical, musical and liturgical.

06:17.117 --> 06:20.121
Of course, a musical and a liturgical are involved in the church.

06:20.581 --> 06:29.733
But we say musical because I'm using notations, whereas here it's only words which they either read or even chanted.

06:29.753 --> 06:32.597
And you see again big numbers.

06:33.218 --> 06:36.161
Aha, I'm approaching, you see, I'm approaching to 2000.

06:36.422 --> 06:37.423
Very close.

06:37.443 --> 06:39.665
Very close.

06:39.685 --> 06:40.306
Ah!

06:43.249 --> 06:43.810
1996.

06:43.830 --> 06:44.270
1996.

06:44.491 --> 06:51.298
Why, I want just to see the 2000.

06:51.959 --> 06:58.426
It's been at some time which I haven't been here, and... It's so close.

06:59.047 --> 07:01.690
It's always, you see, 1996, 1996.

07:02.024 --> 07:06.690
All these have been discovered just recently, very recently.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.793
You mean that's the year they were discovered?

07:08.853 --> 07:12.698
No, this is the number which will be given to the new catalogs.

07:12.838 --> 07:14.360
Yeah, but there were a lot of them in 1996.

07:14.541 --> 07:15.562
That's all one?

07:15.582 --> 07:15.682
Yes.

07:16.243 --> 07:17.825
No, it's probably a series.

07:19.307 --> 07:25.315
And you see those songs of David, and we're having 11th century,

07:26.257 --> 07:33.178
17th century, and that's probably the reason why we qualify the 2000, because they're giving the same number for some reason as with expert numbers.

07:33.700 --> 07:37.592
You see, Capacita, 1996, it's always the same, it's always the same.

07:37.652 --> 07:39.979
So you've probably got more than 2050.

07:40.212 --> 07:44.656
I'm sure 2015 was a very observative number.

07:45.097 --> 07:50.102
As I said, I've been working on the new libraries, so I'm not very much here.

07:50.242 --> 07:52.944
I don't know if... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

07:53.044 --> 07:54.546
But see the centuries.

07:54.566 --> 07:58.830
15th century, 17th century, 16th century, 18th century.

07:59.651 --> 08:03.875
They even discovered 1345, the exact date.

08:05.156 --> 08:07.058
15th century, 17th century.

08:07.398 --> 08:08.059
And these are...

08:08.377 --> 08:09.718
found here and there.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.883
Some of them, which I found as well as some other fathers, are mixed.

08:15.024 --> 08:27.918
Mixed, that means that it was a manuscript and a print book, and the monk who had it, he didn't have enough money, so he placed both the manuscripts and the printed books next to it.

08:28.058 --> 08:35.025
And this makes them very unique, because they might be an old printed book and also an old manuscript.

08:36.102 --> 08:40.307
Here what do we have?

08:41.388 --> 08:44.711
I don't know, this is something very new for me.

08:44.731 --> 08:48.816
I'm discovering the library here.

08:48.836 --> 08:49.637
What do you have here?

08:51.198 --> 08:51.819
Aha!

08:52.359 --> 08:57.125
These are manuscripts which haven't been given number and they are very, very recent.

08:57.985 --> 08:58.326
You see?

08:58.366 --> 08:59.427
Printed book.

09:00.605 --> 09:02.888
And suddenly the printed book becomes.

09:03.308 --> 09:09.796
It's the printed book, printed book, and suddenly they lost the pages, whatever happens, and then we have a decent manuscript.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.839
And look how beautiful it is, how close it is.

09:13.140 --> 09:14.001
You think that it's printed.

09:14.041 --> 09:17.705
That's why many times the librarians didn't know that it was printed.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.528
They just said, book.

09:20.969 --> 09:24.193
Whereas we now go all the way, and then suddenly, oops.

09:24.213 --> 09:25.274
Oh, it looks different color.

09:25.294 --> 09:28.738
Different color, different color, different calligraphy, oops.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.982
And it's on lined paper, too.

09:33.665 --> 09:41.934
Are these tiles, do you think, from the originalist building, or these floors, the tiles?

09:42.755 --> 09:43.576
This looks very old.

09:44.517 --> 09:53.588
Of course, not that very, very original, but there must be from the time when they brought the books here, I'm sure, in 1867.

09:53.608 --> 09:55.790
And this is the turret right here, the turret.

09:55.911 --> 09:58.033
Yes, it looks at the church.

09:58.756 --> 09:59.998
And you can go to the top.

10:01.019 --> 10:02.200
I don't have to.

10:02.381 --> 10:04.924
And it's a little dangerous.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.747
The stairs, it's very high.

10:07.788 --> 10:08.869
When you go up, it's easy.

10:08.889 --> 10:10.932
But when you go down, it's true.

10:10.952 --> 10:14.216
I've got a bad leg.

10:14.877 --> 10:16.899
I'm not very fit.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.402
Because I'm working from the desk.

10:21.225 --> 10:22.707
And, okay.

10:22.727 --> 10:23.508
We've done it.

10:23.788 --> 10:27.733
And here, here, we have brought just another collection of

10:28.000 --> 10:30.863
in our collection from the skit of St.

10:30.923 --> 10:31.484
Dimitris.

10:31.504 --> 10:35.848
That's another skit when we came here which was almost abandoned.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.131
We only find two, three old men.

10:38.191 --> 10:41.254
Now we have only one and he's very old and he'll go living with us here.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.856
So what's the skit now?

10:43.156 --> 10:43.637
St.

10:43.857 --> 10:44.618
Dimitris.

10:44.638 --> 10:45.339
But is it closed?

10:45.479 --> 10:46.179
It's closed.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.664
But there is a man there who lives in a cell and he takes care of the place there.

10:51.205 --> 10:51.785
One person?

10:51.926 --> 10:52.807
Only one person.

10:53.247 --> 10:55.049
But he doesn't belong to the skit.

10:55.289 --> 10:57.872
He has his own cell which belongs to the monastery.

10:58.274 --> 11:00.597
So actually this kid has nobody there.

11:00.618 --> 11:07.888
And the one who lives today used to be the chief there.

11:08.029 --> 11:11.854
And when he came here he brought all the manuscripts they had.

11:12.155 --> 11:13.216
They are not very old.

11:14.218 --> 11:17.903
They are only two or three hundred years old.

11:17.923 --> 11:19.987
For our standards.

11:20.007 --> 11:21.649
I know for America this is very old.

11:21.916 --> 11:26.223
America was discovered in the, what was it, 15th century?

11:26.243 --> 11:26.463
1498.

11:26.724 --> 11:33.034
In the end of 15th century, and became a state in, what was it, 18th century.

11:34.516 --> 11:40.987
So these are, and you can see that it's monks, and it's not professional.

11:41.047 --> 11:43.090
You can see that it's not professional.

11:43.110 --> 11:43.852
But it's important.

11:43.952 --> 11:47.077
It's good and supportive, of course, of course, definitely.

11:48.740 --> 11:49.020
Wow.

11:50.452 --> 11:56.700
The Parorniparty, his doctrine to fill some of this book, exists for the glory of God Almighty.

12:02.788 --> 12:09.136
And he says that it was something which I tried to do, he says, using ink and pen.

12:10.859 --> 12:18.889
And he did this for the choir, and I hope that they will be, he says, useful

12:20.253 --> 12:22.155
You see, it's something personal.

12:24.137 --> 12:25.738
They have made a caramelo for them.

12:25.758 --> 12:28.461
We have a caramelo for them, because they are very few.

12:28.821 --> 12:39.552
We have a new caramelo by the one who is doing it for the bee collection, but I don't see it here.

12:40.873 --> 12:42.355
We will find down steps.

12:42.555 --> 12:44.257
I keep stepping.

12:44.657 --> 12:48.741
Here you may find

12:48.957 --> 13:17.715
secular books here, you know, tragedies, comedies, and, for example, Geography of Macedonia, Bibles, The Affamiliates of Christmas Song in English, Liturgy System in the West in English, you may find Classicals in Chienos,

13:18.117 --> 13:18.978
Roman and Greek.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.802
And you may find newspapers.

13:23.082 --> 13:24.583
Ah, that's another thing.

13:25.124 --> 13:26.105
These are newspapers.

13:26.926 --> 13:28.727
We have newspapers 200 years old.

13:28.908 --> 13:38.077
And this is the future of archaeology, according to some experts, in the newspapers, especially the old ones, which I consider as the New Orleans.

13:39.358 --> 13:39.798
I agree.

13:40.239 --> 13:42.161
Another criticism of mine.

13:42.841 --> 13:45.424
It's one of the reasons I get out of the newspaper business.

13:46.079 --> 13:49.382
I used to... No, you are generally so... I have to be careful.

13:49.402 --> 13:50.303
No, I agree.

13:50.323 --> 13:51.604
I think it's terrible.

13:51.684 --> 13:52.405
Irresponsible.

13:52.685 --> 13:56.489
In English, it's really... Irresponsible and trivial.

13:57.349 --> 14:02.954
And also in America, when I was there... The New York Times is still pretty good.

14:02.974 --> 14:08.139
Yes, but you see a lot of bias things, you know, a lot of bias things.

14:08.159 --> 14:12.783
For example, they present Arabs as if horrible, evil people, you know.

14:12.804 --> 14:13.564
Right.

14:13.584 --> 14:15.546
From the Jewish lobby.

14:16.184 --> 14:18.907
They present the Russians as either as soldiers.

14:21.190 --> 14:27.277
They are not saying what America is doing outside its boundaries.

14:28.439 --> 14:33.945
They are not saying many, many, many things, unfortunately.

14:33.965 --> 14:38.090
And the people have an alternative just to accept this.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.997
But journalism is really, really, especially in Greece today,

14:44.365 --> 14:46.047
I say this responsibly.

14:46.067 --> 14:48.130
Most of them are scoundrels.

14:50.133 --> 14:55.401
And just because they can write, they are given... Please don't write that.

14:55.421 --> 14:55.922
No, that's right.

14:55.942 --> 14:57.244
I'm just saying most of them are scoundrels.

14:57.304 --> 15:01.309
I love it.

15:01.329 --> 15:01.730
I agree.

15:02.211 --> 15:03.913
Because they will come to another party.

15:03.933 --> 15:04.774
There are many of them.

15:04.835 --> 15:05.916
No, I won't write this.

15:06.817 --> 15:08.079
It's not relevant to what we're doing.

15:08.099 --> 15:09.061
Let me give you an example.

15:09.081 --> 15:10.423
It's not relevant to what we're doing.

15:10.683 --> 15:10.923
Yes.

15:11.765 --> 15:12.686
I'll even shut it off.

15:12.706 --> 15:12.786
Yes.
