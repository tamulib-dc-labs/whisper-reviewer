WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:08.686
Well, I want to tell you what a great pleasure it is for me to be talking with you.

00:08.786 --> 00:10.387
Thank you very much.

00:10.407 --> 00:11.128
It's a great honor.

00:11.569 --> 00:21.559
And I guess this is a watershed book in your development as a writer, and I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about that.

00:21.959 --> 00:25.843
Is it in fact a watershed book in your development?

00:25.863 --> 00:26.424
What did you say?

00:27.184 --> 00:28.666
About this novel?

00:29.026 --> 00:30.668
Yes.

00:30.688 --> 00:32.670
This is my first novel.

00:32.988 --> 00:43.598
and I began to write when I was a student, twenty-three years old, student of Tokyo University.

00:45.220 --> 00:56.111
Then the next year, when I was twenty-three years old, I wrote this first novel.

00:56.131 --> 01:01.476
Then this is my first work, and also this is

01:01.507 --> 01:05.351
This is what I wanted to write when I began to write.

01:06.573 --> 01:10.136
When I was a student, I hoped to write two things.

01:10.937 --> 01:22.730
One thing is our students in the Tokyo city, how we students of Tokyo are living or feeling or thinking.

01:23.992 --> 01:30.619
Then the first theme was what I was

01:31.392 --> 01:45.594
feeling when I was child, between the war, in a small town, small, very, very small village, surrounded, very thick, dense forest.

01:46.115 --> 01:46.515
Thick.

01:46.535 --> 01:46.716
Thick.

01:46.956 --> 01:48.338
Yeah.

01:48.639 --> 01:51.083
In Shikoku Island.

01:52.144 --> 01:59.155
The Shikoku Island is one of the, I believe, the smallest

02:00.923 --> 02:05.849
four islands of Japanese archipelago.

02:06.930 --> 02:07.731
I'm sorry, what was that word?

02:08.111 --> 02:08.251
Four?

02:08.452 --> 02:12.396
In Japan, the Japanese archipelago.

02:12.656 --> 02:13.618
Okay, yes, I'm sorry.

02:13.638 --> 02:14.238
Yes, I understand.

02:14.258 --> 02:24.250
Yes, then the smallest one is Shikoku, and in the middle of Shikoku, in the forest district, my village was.

02:24.931 --> 02:28.855
So, how we

02:29.037 --> 02:33.903
children experienced in that small village during the war.

02:34.183 --> 02:36.686
That was my theme.

02:37.006 --> 02:37.887
I wanted to write.

02:37.927 --> 02:54.066
So shortly after I began to write my short stories, I wanted to write this novel, NIP,

02:54.552 --> 03:00.019
The title has changed in English a couple of times, I guess, the translation of it.

03:00.039 --> 03:00.479
Yes, you're right.

03:01.881 --> 03:08.810
This title was, at first, Nip the Bad, Gun the Kid.

03:10.332 --> 03:17.841
But Marion Boyer said that the gun is too strong, so she want to take a shoot.

03:17.861 --> 03:21.146
So Marion suggested the change of the title.

03:21.186 --> 03:22.247
Yes, yes.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.155
That's cute.

03:24.235 --> 03:25.577
That is so.

03:26.338 --> 03:33.468
But I'm interested in how this really was so influential in your development, in the thematic development of your work.

03:34.269 --> 03:34.689
Yes.

03:34.709 --> 03:39.255
And it has been said that this is a watershed work in your development.

03:39.275 --> 03:39.356
Yes.

03:39.376 --> 03:45.143
And of course it was written before the birth of your son, which also changed your life as well.

03:45.404 --> 03:45.644
Yes.

03:45.764 --> 03:48.828
And maybe you can address yourself to both of those questions.

03:48.888 --> 03:51.492
Yes, that's a very accurate question.

03:51.725 --> 04:01.395
In the beginning, I hoped to, I wanted to write how I was in the war time.

04:01.415 --> 04:13.708
Because I believe I was born and I lived until the end of the war.

04:14.649 --> 04:20.415
So to me, my boyhood during the war is the most important thing.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.916
in the first half of my life.

04:24.637 --> 04:36.990
So I was, during the war, I was born in 1935, and the war began in 1941, and it ended in 1945.

04:37.651 --> 04:50.605
And I became a pupil of the school when the war began.

04:51.243 --> 05:07.099
And during the four years, five years, I was very strong, under the very strong education of Japanese imperialist creed.

05:07.379 --> 05:21.013
So I wanted, I believed that my, our emperor is a god, I must die for the god emperor and

05:21.179 --> 05:24.704
This is only one hope of my boyhood.

05:25.384 --> 05:31.532
And also I'm very deeply afraid that I must die for the God.

05:31.552 --> 05:35.177
And so... You felt this as a child?

05:35.498 --> 05:36.479
Yes, yes, yes.

05:36.499 --> 05:37.740
When I was a child.

05:38.281 --> 05:50.477
So, but even to the child, you know, our teacher always teaches about our...

05:51.638 --> 05:59.666
very aggressive imperialist education, like the Hitlerjugend.

06:00.466 --> 06:21.426
So, I think every morning our teacher asks us, how do you, when you are, if God, emperor asks you to die, then we must die, answer aloud,

06:21.575 --> 06:22.496
Yes, I died.

06:23.798 --> 06:26.382
I cut off my belly and I died.

06:26.483 --> 06:27.624
I cut off my what?

06:27.644 --> 06:29.127
My belly, yeah.

06:29.187 --> 06:29.727
Belly, right?

06:29.748 --> 06:31.070
Belly, okay.

06:31.090 --> 06:36.558
Then sometimes I was delayed, delayed to answer.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.421
What was that word again?

06:38.661 --> 06:47.274
When our teacher asked us, how do you do it when God asks you to die?

06:47.294 --> 06:50.299
I hesitate to answer.

06:51.038 --> 06:52.099
A little time.

06:52.820 --> 07:01.388
Then, always I was strongly beaten by the teacher.

07:02.329 --> 07:18.885
Why I hated to take this, I couldn't believe the great emperor believes in me, knows me, this child in a small village of Shikoku.

07:19.490 --> 07:26.580
Mr. Gold Emperor can know my name or my existence in this place.

07:27.081 --> 07:29.264
So I couldn't answer so rapidly.

07:29.825 --> 07:33.130
But anyway, that was our education.

07:33.591 --> 07:37.596
Then the war ended and a new constitution was made.

07:37.616 --> 07:41.642
This is a constitution of American democracy.

07:42.203 --> 07:48.973
And we found out a very new perspective about my life.

07:49.257 --> 07:58.529
So I went to Tokyo and I studied, I began to study the literature of France, French literature.

07:58.869 --> 08:07.260
But anyway, before the end of the war, the war time, my boyhood was the most important thing.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.481
Do you mind if I shoot a couple while you talk?

08:09.122 --> 08:13.948
Yes, so I created this Nobel and also

08:14.333 --> 08:23.686
I wrote this novel from the side of children who came to our village, not the side of the villagers.

08:24.467 --> 08:41.269
So I always felt I am isolated in this village when I was a little boy, so I wanted to write from the side of

08:42.970 --> 08:46.594
children who came to my village.

08:46.614 --> 08:48.997
That is what I wanted to write.

08:51.820 --> 08:52.320
That's OK.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.181
I'm listening, sir.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.143
You can keep talking.

08:54.203 --> 08:54.483
Yes.

08:56.385 --> 09:05.195
But then, in terms of how this, again, changed the focus of the themes that you would develop as a writer.

09:06.036 --> 09:06.276
Oh, yes.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.720
Yes, then, after this novel,

09:09.987 --> 09:20.502
I continued to write my life and inner life of Japanese students in Tokyo city.

09:20.983 --> 09:34.442
So I continued to write many short stories and some novels about how we are living after the war and during the occupation and after occupation.

09:36.144 --> 09:38.087
That was my thing.

09:38.945 --> 09:52.183
Then I think I was, when I was 28 years old, my son was born with difficulty.

09:52.583 --> 09:57.570
So I began to write about my son and my life.

09:57.590 --> 10:03.698
So I think I began my writing very early when I was 22 years old.

10:03.818 --> 10:08.665
And I believe when I was 23 years old,

10:08.965 --> 10:16.752
I accomplished my first groups through this nipida.

10:17.252 --> 10:28.041
And then, after that, I was in the crisis of young writers who cannot continue the... This is after this book?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.102
Ah, yes.

10:29.122 --> 10:29.242
Yes.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.744
And this is after the birth of your son?

10:31.084 --> 10:33.666
Then... Or prior to the birth of your son?

10:33.686 --> 10:34.147
Yeah, yeah.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.147
I met the birth of my son.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.230
Then I am very deeply troubled and I...

10:38.632 --> 10:44.357
I have forgotten about my novels, so I must fight against it.

10:44.638 --> 10:49.682
Were you driven, obsessed with writing?

10:49.742 --> 10:54.987
Were you driven to express yourself in a literary way?

10:56.068 --> 11:01.393
I'm wondering about the motivation to write.

11:02.314 --> 11:04.896
Was it an obsession with you, I wonder?

11:04.916 --> 11:05.837
In the beginning?

11:06.037 --> 11:08.840
Oh, yes.

11:09.961 --> 11:23.156
I think I am, I felt in my situation, young boy, children who was born in a small village and who lived.

11:23.376 --> 11:23.977
Generations.

11:24.117 --> 11:24.358
Yeah.

11:24.718 --> 11:35.470
My generation is, I hope to write in the name of my generation and also during, among my generation,

11:35.804 --> 11:46.020
I felt I am rather strange because later I am studying French literature and so I wanted to write.

11:46.621 --> 11:48.444
That was the motive at first.

11:48.664 --> 11:55.855
And second motive is I want to understand my situation with my

11:57.050 --> 12:01.415
You mean your situation personally, or your situation as a person living in this time?

12:01.595 --> 12:02.897
Yes, yes, yes.

12:02.917 --> 12:03.017
Both.

12:03.037 --> 12:05.800
I mean, existentially your situation, or personally?

12:05.820 --> 12:06.581
Yes, yes.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.062
You are right.

12:08.503 --> 12:22.939
At first I wanted to write my personal, very personal situation with my son, and through writing my situation, very personal situation, I wanted to express something about the very large,

12:23.375 --> 12:31.465
I'm just trying to, for the sake of the tape, so I'll know the word.

12:32.567 --> 12:33.188
Okay, go ahead.

12:33.208 --> 12:33.868
I'm sorry to interrupt.

12:35.330 --> 12:43.461
Then, on that time I was studying and researching the Hiroshima problem.

12:44.162 --> 12:52.993
So, I think within myself, the Hiroshima problem, that is a very social problem.

12:53.530 --> 12:56.593
It's a spiritual problem too, isn't it?

12:56.613 --> 12:57.695
Yes, yes, yes.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.879
Coming to terms with this is more than just a social problem and a medical problem.

13:01.959 --> 13:02.860
Yes, yes.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.964
I have to believe it's a spiritual problem as well.

13:05.984 --> 13:06.504
Yes, yes.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.446
And I think that reflects itself in writing too.

13:08.466 --> 13:09.387
I agree with you completely.

13:10.048 --> 13:19.819
Then I wanted to write about my personal problem and to reach our spiritual problem.

13:20.539 --> 13:22.862
That is motivation of my next...

13:23.332 --> 13:25.374
stage in the private matter.

13:26.075 --> 13:45.014
Then I continued to write about my son and also I developed my literature to write about my village more socially, more historically, more mystical.

13:45.755 --> 13:53.102
I wanted to write the myth

13:53.825 --> 13:55.167
Miss of Japanese.

13:55.187 --> 13:55.828
Oh, okay, okay.

13:55.908 --> 13:56.329
Yeah, okay.

13:56.349 --> 13:57.610
Okay, I understand.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.855
Of our village and our district.

14:02.017 --> 14:18.601
So, and then also now I'm now organizing everything, very personal matter, with my son and also my village and my society and my Japan.

14:20.464 --> 14:23.528
That is my literature.

14:23.862 --> 14:40.360
I understand, from what I've read, is that with the awarding of the Nobel Prize, you basically now feel that your work as a novelist is complete.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.582
Am I correct in that?

14:42.782 --> 14:43.883
You're correct.

14:44.324 --> 14:48.128
But that is not because I got the prize.

14:48.228 --> 14:48.869
I understand that.

14:49.269 --> 14:53.093
But because I...

14:53.377 --> 14:55.480
I'm now six years old.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.281
You're a young man.

14:56.601 --> 14:58.244
No, no, no.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.145
I'm 52.

14:59.185 --> 15:00.086
You're a young man.

15:00.106 --> 15:13.505
So I wanted to create my conclusion for my literature, or my life, or my age, my generation.

15:14.867 --> 15:22.337
So I continued to write my novels for a long time, so I think, and also I almost

15:22.807 --> 15:34.461
accomplished the story of my son, my miss, my village, my background of the age, everything.

15:35.022 --> 15:40.628
So, especially I have published the trilogy.

15:41.129 --> 15:41.910
The trilogy?

15:41.930 --> 15:42.090
Yeah.

15:42.911 --> 15:43.692
Very, very.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.215
I'm just saying that for my benefit when I come to

15:47.022 --> 15:49.326
transcribe the tape so I'll know what the word is.

15:49.887 --> 15:50.347
Oh, yes.

15:50.488 --> 15:51.369
I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.

15:51.389 --> 15:51.770
That's good.

15:52.010 --> 15:52.651
So, trilogy.

15:52.691 --> 15:59.162
So, my trilogy title is Flaming Green Tree, Flaming.

15:59.182 --> 16:13.806
And just Flaming Green Tree, I am, I believe I have written all of the themes or programs of my

16:15.305 --> 16:21.834
concern to my village or to my town or to my country as a novelist.

16:22.855 --> 16:30.225
So I think I finished my writing of my novels for at least for five years.

16:31.687 --> 16:38.737
Then I began studying about important things to me.

16:38.757 --> 16:44.164
I must read some philosophers and I must read some

16:44.448 --> 17:13.510
novelist again so I want I want to think deep then I want to understand what is the true meaning of my life in my generation and in my place and what is the meaning of my long life to write to write only novels so

17:14.300 --> 17:19.446
I began my last age of study.

17:20.848 --> 17:23.932
So you are now entering a period of study?

17:24.112 --> 17:24.372
Yes.

17:24.933 --> 17:28.457
And you say that there are many books that you wish to read.

17:28.597 --> 17:28.857
Yes.

17:28.877 --> 17:30.059
Can you tell me some of them?

17:30.119 --> 17:32.502
Are they largely Japanese books?

17:32.562 --> 17:34.684
No, no.

17:34.704 --> 17:43.615
Very, very simply speaking, at first two years or three years, I must read Spinoza.

17:43.898 --> 17:45.500
your country.

17:46.301 --> 18:09.045
You know, as a writer, I am writing novels, and also I am a student of French literature, and I read modern French literature, but also I continued to read François

18:09.785 --> 18:25.714
the writer of the Renaissance, French Renaissance, and other figures such as Erasmus, Calvin, Sebastian Castellion, or Henri IV.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.778
The great philosophers.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.180
Yes, Sebastian Castellion.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.945
Those are very important to me.

18:32.212 --> 18:37.740
For 30 years, I continued to read the French Renaissance.

18:38.781 --> 18:45.971
Now, I hope to read post-Renaissance.

18:46.051 --> 18:46.812
Post-Renaissance.

18:46.832 --> 18:47.073
Yes.

18:47.473 --> 18:57.247
Nowadays, we say that post-modernism, post-modern, so I was called a writer of post-modern.

18:57.747 --> 19:00.351
You were called a post-modernist in Japan.

19:00.752 --> 19:01.813
Yes, in Japan.

19:02.165 --> 19:12.516
I hope to create another, myself, not postmodern, but postmodernism.

19:13.277 --> 19:23.168
At some point, after these several years of study which you contemplate, do you expect to enter a new phase of your writing?

19:23.708 --> 19:27.292
Yes, that is what I want to say.

19:27.953 --> 19:32.037
That is not through the form of novels.

19:32.793 --> 19:34.555
Not by the form of the novel.

19:35.255 --> 19:39.399
Not by the form of the novel.

19:39.419 --> 19:43.943
In other words, you won't be writing fiction, so to speak.

19:44.364 --> 19:58.477
Yeah, I'm writing fiction as a novel, so I have a narrative of novelist, narrative of fiction, narrative of novel, but I want to create another narrative.

19:59.177 --> 19:59.958
Another narrative?

20:00.178 --> 20:00.859
Yes.

20:01.210 --> 20:14.151
I don't know what I can do, but anyway, I continued to write novel for a long time, so I feel doomed.

20:14.812 --> 20:20.180
I haven't anything to write in the form of novel anymore.

20:22.444 --> 20:24.587
But I have something to speak.

20:25.228 --> 20:28.213
I think so, and I think that with this

20:29.071 --> 20:39.283
visibility that you now have as a Nobel laureate, and certainly millions of people now are more aware of your work than ever before.

20:39.323 --> 20:43.368
That does kind of place a responsibility on you, doesn't it?

20:43.388 --> 20:48.253
Do you feel a sense of responsibility now that you've won the Nobel laureate?

20:48.273 --> 20:58.285
No, I don't think I haven't, I don't feel responsibility because I am, I, oh,

21:00.188 --> 21:12.346
I don't think I am so great who have the responsibility, but first I must do for myself, you know.

21:13.087 --> 21:14.689
I'm doomed as a novelist.

21:14.709 --> 21:15.911
You're doomed?

21:15.931 --> 21:17.474
Yes, as a novelist.

21:17.534 --> 21:18.054
You are doomed.

21:18.074 --> 21:19.657
Is that the word, doomed?

21:19.697 --> 21:20.859
No, doomed.

21:21.139 --> 21:22.601
I'm in the crisis.

21:22.681 --> 21:23.803
Oh, in the crisis.

21:24.143 --> 21:25.926
Okay, sure.

21:26.497 --> 21:37.288
I finished my trilogy, so I haven't any... Oh yes, I have some images of novels, but I must change my life.

21:38.249 --> 21:48.120
So I think only ten years is... I have not... I have only ten years more, so... You think?

21:48.440 --> 21:49.321
I think.

21:49.341 --> 21:54.867
So, five years study, and after five years I must create new...

21:55.201 --> 21:57.465
style of writing.

21:57.485 --> 22:01.311
There I hope to talk to the children especially.

22:03.254 --> 22:11.767
I hope to write some works which can be read by children and which can be read by old men.

22:12.408 --> 22:15.353
Is this partly a response to your experience with your son?

22:16.261 --> 22:17.302
Oh, yes.

22:17.423 --> 22:23.571
Secondly, I think my son is now composing his music.

22:23.591 --> 22:24.251
That's wonderful.

22:24.372 --> 22:24.952
Thank you very much.

22:24.992 --> 22:26.094
This is extraordinary news.

22:26.114 --> 22:26.274
Yeah.

22:26.294 --> 22:35.426
So, until today, I was thinking about, I must express for my son.

22:35.446 --> 22:36.007
For your son?

22:36.267 --> 22:36.407
Yeah.

22:37.188 --> 22:41.294
But my son can express by himself.

22:41.314 --> 22:42.155
In terms of words.

22:42.175 --> 22:42.455
Yeah.

22:42.535 --> 22:46.200
But he can't express... In terms of...

22:46.450 --> 22:46.910
Music.

22:47.251 --> 22:48.973
But he can express in terms of... Cannot.

22:49.293 --> 22:49.914
He cannot.

22:50.014 --> 22:50.334
Cannot.

22:50.614 --> 22:52.336
But he can in music, though, can't he?

22:52.356 --> 22:53.457
Yes, yes.

22:53.477 --> 23:05.249
And I was thinking, my son cannot express himself by language, like words, so I can express through my words.

23:05.950 --> 23:16.120
But recently, hearing his music, I felt it's my misunderstanding.

23:16.488 --> 23:19.131
My son can understand himself by music.

23:19.432 --> 23:19.932
He can?

23:20.152 --> 23:20.793
He can.

23:21.033 --> 23:25.659
So it's no use, his interpreter.

23:27.081 --> 23:30.245
So I forget, gave up.

23:30.465 --> 23:35.431
I gave up the role of interpreter of my son.

23:35.451 --> 23:36.132
You gave that up.

23:37.353 --> 23:38.054
How do you feel?

23:38.114 --> 23:40.036
What do you feel when you hear his music?

23:41.058 --> 23:41.638
Yes, yes.

23:42.319 --> 23:45.583
At first, there are two CDs.

23:45.901 --> 23:56.657
And when I heard the first CD, I thought, yes, the life is happy, human being is great.

23:56.677 --> 24:06.973
And I'm very deeply shocked from the beauty, very simple beauty, like dew on the grass in the morning.

24:07.834 --> 24:10.719
So I'm very deeply impressed by that.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.663
And then three years passed.

24:13.930 --> 24:17.495
And he created the next CD.

24:18.096 --> 24:20.279
The new music is very dark.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.903
It was dark, you said?

24:22.923 --> 24:23.504
Very dark.

24:24.305 --> 24:27.830
And what do you think he's feeling to create America?

24:27.850 --> 24:30.634
Oh, yeah, dark and like weeping.

24:32.036 --> 24:33.658
His soul is weeping.

24:35.701 --> 24:37.043
His soul is weeping?

24:37.303 --> 24:37.483
Yeah.

24:37.924 --> 24:39.847
And I found out that, yes.

24:40.928 --> 24:42.250
He cannot find out.

24:43.057 --> 24:49.225
his darkness of his sorrow, without music.

24:49.245 --> 25:08.271
But through music, he created the first CD, and every day he could listen, and he found out new images, new content, new... new...

25:08.707 --> 25:30.571
We were thinking about his music, through music, so he could find out the method to express his inner thinking more precisely, more largely, more profoundly.

25:30.591 --> 25:33.895
Then he found out the sadness, the grief.

25:35.336 --> 25:37.819
So that is very shocking to me.

25:38.238 --> 25:45.645
Through writing the music, he conquered his grief.

25:46.585 --> 25:49.748
This must be very inspirational for you, very inspiring.

25:49.928 --> 25:50.429
Yes, yes.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.391
It's the same for me.

25:52.411 --> 26:04.562
So, yes, my son can create music, so I must do something for my spirit or my soul.

26:05.202 --> 26:06.203
That is my...

26:07.043 --> 26:08.625
thinking now.

26:09.326 --> 26:18.340
You certainly, throughout your body of writing, there has been a great respect and a reliance on the power of mythology.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.382
Yes.

26:19.402 --> 26:35.987
And I wonder if in these times through which we've lived, particularly the war and the use of atomic weapons in Japan, do you see the evolution of a new mythology, a modern mythology at all, in your work and also in the literature that follows?

26:36.035 --> 26:37.236
Yes, just precisely.

26:37.437 --> 26:46.127
I hope to create the myth of this nuclear age.

26:46.607 --> 27:03.207
And also I hope to pray for the possibility of new, the newer myth of after, after nuclear age,

27:04.233 --> 27:13.125
That is precisely what I am thinking to write in the future.

27:13.165 --> 27:18.172
To develop this kind of a... Yes, after my study.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.173
After your study?

27:19.193 --> 27:20.094
Yes.

27:20.114 --> 27:33.092
And of course, if you could just tell me in general what the purpose of mythology is to you, or the meaning of it, how you can express your feelings about the world.

27:33.325 --> 27:40.492
through fiction and mythology as opposed to, say, writing essays or works of non-fiction.

27:40.512 --> 27:45.056
I guess it strikes to you, your vision of the power of literature, I guess.

27:45.377 --> 27:51.863
I hope to create a consolidated style.

27:51.883 --> 27:52.604
Consolidate?

27:52.664 --> 27:53.104
Is that a word?

27:53.124 --> 27:53.805
Consecrate?

27:53.885 --> 27:54.405
Is that a word?

27:54.425 --> 27:54.706
No, no.

27:54.906 --> 27:58.269
That is, I hope, to organize.

27:58.729 --> 27:59.110
Organize.

27:59.370 --> 27:59.690
Consolidate.

27:59.710 --> 28:00.531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:00.551 --> 28:01.392
Okay, yes.

28:01.642 --> 28:04.086
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

28:04.166 --> 28:04.266
Yes.

28:04.286 --> 28:15.123
That is not poetry, not novel, not essay, not theater, but also I wanted to include everything.

28:16.545 --> 28:20.652
And also especially I want to write for children.

28:20.692 --> 28:27.362
My, you know, the style of novel today, that is

28:27.663 --> 28:35.893
Also, I want to use the word doomed in the dead end.

28:36.874 --> 28:44.383
Our home of Nobel coming to the dead end in this 10th century.

28:45.224 --> 28:56.657
So I must create, we must fight, we must try very, very difficult task to create the possibility

28:56.873 --> 29:01.900
of the Nobel in the end of this century or in the beginning of the 21st century.

29:02.521 --> 29:12.817
But everyone tries very hard, Giotta Glass, Kundera.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.479
Nadine Gordimer.

29:14.639 --> 29:23.893
Nadine Gordimer, yes, and also Vargas Josa, and you are Apdaek, or you are Norman Bela.

29:24.295 --> 29:29.923
and our Korean writers and Chinese writers and myself.

29:30.504 --> 29:44.785
So, but I tried for a long time to create very, very difficult literature, but now, as another style, I wanted to write more freely.

29:45.878 --> 29:54.309
I've read some place where you say that what you have done is to write about the dignity of human beings.

29:54.329 --> 29:56.292
Yes, always I continue to write about it.

29:57.093 --> 29:59.135
Dignity of human beings in the nuclear age.

30:00.177 --> 30:11.151
And so when you're writing fiction, again, there's also the storyteller at work, because a novel doesn't work unless somebody is engaged by the story, right?

30:11.332 --> 30:12.934
There has to be a sense of narrative.

30:12.954 --> 30:13.935
Don't you agree with that?

30:14.476 --> 30:15.497
I mean, we've talked about

30:15.983 --> 30:20.049
writing to send a message, so to speak.

30:20.229 --> 30:26.018
But at the same time, you have to be mindful about the necessity of engaging the reader.

30:26.198 --> 30:26.479
Yes.

30:27.019 --> 30:29.623
And so are you constantly thinking of stories?

30:29.764 --> 30:34.390
I guess this embraces that whole concept of mythology that you were talking about a little while ago.

30:34.491 --> 30:34.831
Yes.

30:35.773 --> 30:42.443
That's a very accurate understanding that I am, I continued to write stories for a long time.

30:43.304 --> 30:45.467
The story, narrative or story.

30:45.599 --> 30:49.925
It's not enough now, to me.

30:49.945 --> 30:50.706
It has to be more.

30:51.687 --> 30:53.569
Oh, yes.

30:54.350 --> 31:05.665
You know, the narrative of the story is always progressing horizontally, and I hope to think about it vertically now.

31:05.685 --> 31:06.626
Think about what, I'm sorry?

31:06.947 --> 31:07.848
Vertically.

31:07.868 --> 31:08.328
Vertically.

31:08.428 --> 31:08.749
Yeah.

31:09.089 --> 31:11.953
That's excellent.

31:12.674 --> 31:15.117
And the direction vertically is...

31:15.232 --> 31:17.535
in terms of content as opposed to stories.

31:17.555 --> 31:18.516
About the spirit.

31:18.776 --> 31:20.719
OK, that's very important.

31:24.263 --> 31:30.170
I guess you're giving a lecture today at Harvard, is that right?

31:30.430 --> 31:30.610
Yes, yes.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.132
And what is the subject of the lecture?

31:32.492 --> 31:43.045
Oh, my subject is, I wanted to give you the, if you ask Professor Rubin, you can take the text.

31:43.717 --> 31:44.478
I can take what?

31:44.919 --> 31:46.061
My text.

31:46.422 --> 31:48.746
Mr. Rubin, please.

31:50.068 --> 31:52.232
I think before my lecture you can get it.

31:54.476 --> 32:00.105
They deliver to every listener because they can't understand through my speech.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.708
Oh, so there is a text?

32:02.347 --> 32:03.708
I read the text.

32:03.788 --> 32:04.870
I see.

32:05.410 --> 32:07.072
Does Marion have a copy of the text?

32:07.152 --> 32:11.596
No, I have it in my baggage, so I wanted to give that.

32:11.917 --> 32:12.377
Okay.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.139
Do you have an extra copy with you?

32:15.040 --> 32:15.921
In my luggage.

32:16.541 --> 32:18.323
If you have one, I'd love to take one.

32:18.343 --> 32:19.044
It might help me in this.

32:19.324 --> 32:22.968
Yes, but yes, if you cannot take that.

32:24.729 --> 32:25.110
Professor?

32:25.130 --> 32:27.392
Yeah, Rubin.

32:27.625 --> 32:32.550
But when do you come to my lecture?

32:32.570 --> 32:33.011
I can't.

32:33.071 --> 32:34.352
I have my daughter with me.

32:34.412 --> 32:34.733
Oh, yes.

32:35.113 --> 32:43.222
Then I think if you make telephone call to Rubin, you can easily.

32:43.322 --> 32:44.763
D-U-B-I-N, Rubin?

32:44.923 --> 32:46.345
Yeah, Rubin.

32:46.485 --> 32:47.346
R-U-B-I-N.

32:47.506 --> 32:49.809
And what department is he in?

32:49.829 --> 32:50.990
The department literature.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.211
OK, I'll find it.

32:52.291 --> 32:53.292
Yes, yes.

32:53.312 --> 32:55.455
I'm sure you can fax it to me or whatever.

32:55.475 --> 32:56.135
Yes.

32:56.736 --> 32:56.856
Great.

32:57.207 --> 33:01.595
Okay, and you met with all these other Nobel laureates in Atlanta.

33:01.655 --> 33:02.256
Yes.

33:02.276 --> 33:07.485
And tell me, was that interesting for you, to find what these other people are thinking about?

33:07.745 --> 33:10.250
Yes, Atlanta.

33:11.171 --> 33:18.945
I think Nobel Prize, whether or not, can be alone.

33:19.482 --> 33:35.800
And also writer can be connected, make a very deep contact with other novelists, such as I feel very deep relationship with Nadine Godima.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.165
I interviewed her last 12 here, by the way.

33:41.306 --> 33:44.149
I did an interview with her like me we're doing now.

33:44.649 --> 33:45.490
She's wonderful.

33:45.672 --> 33:57.165
then there's not the necessity to gather, to come together in Atlanta.

33:57.746 --> 34:11.342
But so I was doubting about the meaning to come all together in Atlanta at first.

34:11.896 --> 34:18.646
But as a newcomer of Nobel Prize laureate, I wanted to say hello to everything.

34:18.666 --> 34:20.188
So I went there.

34:21.070 --> 34:30.023
Then I found out many authors, very brilliant authors came.

34:30.524 --> 34:41.160
And I found out almost every of them has the scar of 20th century, you know, the scar.

34:42.102 --> 34:47.608
from the civilian war in Spain.

34:53.635 --> 35:05.769
Claude Simon had a scar of Spain, Spanish war, a civilian war in Spain, and Octavio Paz had a scar as a Mexican intellectual he created.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.953
He experienced many much of things

35:09.305 --> 35:28.289
Also, our Shoinka scar from the African-Nigeria, and Shoinka, Derek Walcott, of the anti-right-hand, and Tony Molson as a colored intellectual in your country.

35:28.909 --> 35:35.818
And I myself have the scar of the wartime and after the war.

35:37.064 --> 35:40.027
That is water I have lived in for a long time.

35:40.668 --> 35:45.092
And I was from the Russian.

35:46.393 --> 35:48.075
So it really is a community, isn't it?

35:48.095 --> 35:51.178
Yes, a community of the 20th century.

35:51.759 --> 35:56.103
Every of the members had a very deep scar of this age.

35:56.723 --> 35:59.606
Scars of the age?

35:59.666 --> 35:59.867
Yes.

36:00.207 --> 36:03.030
Then I found out, yes, this is a human being.

36:04.491 --> 36:06.413
This is a human being of 20th century.

36:07.270 --> 36:21.089
So I thought, yes, it is meaningful to speak very honestly about our being and our literature.

36:21.950 --> 36:25.014
So I enjoyed it.

36:25.034 --> 36:36.450
I don't know how to phrase this question, and maybe you can help me a little bit, but I'm really so profoundly moved at how the experience that you have had, you and your wife, with your son,

36:36.582 --> 36:39.045
and how profoundly it changed your life.

36:39.145 --> 36:39.466
Yes.

36:40.267 --> 36:48.597
And has it made you a better person, a better writer, a more important writer, in your view, to have gone through this experience?

36:48.897 --> 36:51.400
Would you have been a different writer, more politically involved?

36:51.661 --> 37:01.613
I wonder, if we look at the road that goes right and the road that goes left, had this boy been born like all other children, you'd have been a different person entirely, wouldn't you?

37:01.693 --> 37:04.176
And your writing would have been different.

37:04.780 --> 37:15.310
But without the birth of my son, I believe I must have ended writing very early.

37:15.450 --> 37:25.740
After this nip the bird, I think I hadn't any true theme of my literature.

37:26.261 --> 37:27.502
You had not any true theme?

37:27.522 --> 37:27.943
I hadn't.

37:28.223 --> 37:33.288
So the son gave you the theme then, didn't he?

37:33.308 --> 37:33.488
Yes, yes.

37:34.008 --> 37:50.544
I hope to speak more warmly about myself, the birth of my son, and how I fought, how I struggled with my son and with my wife.

37:51.405 --> 37:53.587
That gave me the new theme.

37:54.528 --> 37:59.333
Then I began writing as a completely new writer.

38:00.474 --> 38:01.635
So now I am.

38:02.257 --> 38:05.901
Do you think that your work should be seen as a body of work?

38:05.961 --> 38:09.986
Are these all parts of a corpus, so to speak, as an oeuvre?

38:10.907 --> 38:14.671
And to understand what you've done, we must see the whole thing.

38:15.032 --> 38:15.172
Yes.

38:15.192 --> 38:15.593
Accurately so.

38:15.673 --> 38:30.610
Accurately, this is, I think, my work is a kind of opera, oeuvre complete, oeuvre, oeuvre shorty, oeuvre complete, in total.

38:30.843 --> 38:41.598
I am very happy to get this prize because they began translating my work again here.

38:42.179 --> 38:57.880
So I think if they translate my trilogy, my newest and the last trilogy, this flaming green tree, then they can find out.

38:58.265 --> 39:22.399
the totality that began with this Nipusa bud and its end by framing green tree and that is strongly supported by the birth of my son and my life in the general situation of Japanese life.

39:23.408 --> 39:35.312
I don't know if this question is relevant or not, and if it's not, we don't have to answer it, but I wonder what you feel when, you know, you lived through a terrible war and a nuclear attack in the country.

39:35.332 --> 39:35.713
Yes, yes.

39:35.862 --> 39:43.072
And then today, in the last couple of months, we see in your country Japanese people attacking Japanese people with gas.

39:43.132 --> 39:46.778
In our country, we have Americans blowing up Americans in Oklahoma City.

39:46.978 --> 39:48.200
It's very depressing, isn't it?

39:48.580 --> 39:56.191
What does this tell us about where we're going with human nature and any sense of human dignity?

39:56.652 --> 40:00.958
We're destroying our own people.

40:01.715 --> 40:14.428
If I speak about Japan, we Japanese are now today regarded as a strong people.

40:15.229 --> 40:29.443
They create many products and they sell it to the overseas and they have many strong yen and they are prosperous in the meaning of

40:30.149 --> 40:30.850
economics.

40:31.511 --> 40:39.143
But I always, I have been felt that Japan and Japanese is very, very vulnerable.

40:41.426 --> 40:44.210
Vulnerable country and vulnerable people.

40:45.071 --> 40:54.065
So now it is the time that our vulnerability comes on the surface of our life.

40:55.147 --> 40:58.772
Then some people

40:59.984 --> 41:09.196
who are completely against, hostile to Japan society, they create the poisonous gas, and they attack us.

41:09.997 --> 41:16.345
So that is, very simply speaking, now Japan's vulnerability becomes very clear.

41:17.207 --> 41:17.907
That is the first point.

41:18.328 --> 41:25.958
And about your Oklahoma bombing, I don't know the true meaning, but I feel very strong

41:26.579 --> 41:27.760
Relationship.

41:27.781 --> 41:30.043
It's almost a civil war, in a sense.

41:30.184 --> 41:32.146
Yes, yes, yes, civil war.

41:32.186 --> 41:35.971
And that's what's so, that we kill each other in our own way.

41:36.071 --> 41:37.873
Oh, yes, yes.

41:38.414 --> 41:42.419
Listen, I'm running out of time, and I know you, no, no, not for me, I'm thinking about you.

41:42.439 --> 41:42.719
Yes.

41:42.739 --> 41:45.723
But I wonder, would you inscribe this for me?

41:45.763 --> 41:48.186
Yes, with a big pleasure, yes.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.468
This is my name here.

41:50.970 --> 41:54.274
Show it to me, yeah.

41:57.713 --> 41:58.294
Thank you.

41:58.314 --> 41:59.295
This has been a question.

41:59.776 --> 42:00.457
One more question.

42:00.557 --> 42:12.874
A recurring theme in your work is Eden, lost Eden, the loss of Eden, of the Garden of Eden, the loss of innocence, I guess, is a theme of yours.

42:13.195 --> 42:17.020
And that is a theme that has been apparent throughout your work, I guess.

42:17.240 --> 42:24.210
Is that something that has been always something that you've considered in writing?

42:24.562 --> 42:25.183
Yes.

42:25.563 --> 42:31.452
But then you've also been quoted as saying that how Hikari, is that how you pronounce his name, your son?

42:31.492 --> 42:32.253
Yes, Hikari.

42:32.333 --> 42:33.434
How he saved your life.

42:33.975 --> 42:36.659
Is that a fair quote?

42:36.679 --> 42:40.164
I guess I read someplace where you said he actually in a way saved your life.

42:40.724 --> 42:54.163
Yes, Hikari saved me and Hikari gave me the chance of recovery from

42:55.527 --> 43:07.464
very, very deep recovery, my recovery, personal recovery, and also social recovery, the image of social recovery of Japan.

43:08.085 --> 43:23.728
He gave me that hint of reconciliation, reconciliation with my son, and also reconciliation among my family, and reconciliation among our

43:25.075 --> 43:51.657
society and our reconciliation with china and with korea and those uh recovery and reconciliation and redemption if i yeah if i use a lot of christianity i and she gave me the hint for the for the redemption but i and i'm writing about this for a long time but now

43:51.957 --> 44:09.464
I hope not through the Nobel, but more directly, I hope to express my image of reconciliation or recovery or redemption to Japanese colleagues.

44:09.484 --> 44:17.897
That is my motivation to change my life.

44:18.417 --> 44:20.539
to study and to write a new thing.

44:20.859 --> 44:22.621
I'm glad I asked the last question.

44:23.001 --> 44:33.951
You know, I am a very funny Japanese who hasn't any camera and who has any automobiles, any motor cars.

44:34.532 --> 44:36.654
You have no motor car either?

44:36.974 --> 44:37.314
Either.

44:37.435 --> 44:37.855
I haven't.

44:38.215 --> 44:38.536
Why?

44:38.856 --> 44:45.522
But in my village, my mother always saying, you must not buy

44:45.822 --> 44:49.513
because you haven't any place to go.

44:49.895 --> 44:51.740
How about the camera?

44:52.302 --> 44:58.421
You must not buy your camera because you know everyone in my village.

44:58.441 --> 44:58.802
That's funny.
