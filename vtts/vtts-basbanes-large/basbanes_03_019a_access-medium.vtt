WEBVTT

00:04.537 --> 00:06.599
I'll just put it over there.

00:06.619 --> 00:09.943
And we're talking with Jonathan.

00:09.963 --> 00:14.508
I guess, of course, you are one of the great historians.

00:14.548 --> 00:22.036
When it comes to China and the Orient, there's no one stronger than yourself.

00:22.136 --> 00:28.644
And you were active in her role, I guess, in initiating this project at Yale.

00:28.764 --> 00:33.649
I wonder if we could just enter the conversation talking a little bit about that, your thoughts about it,

00:34.152 --> 00:38.658
what I thought was important, and it's ironically English.

00:38.998 --> 00:42.263
Yes, I wasn't, I didn't think I was an initiator in any way.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.486
Not an initiator, but you certainly had, yeah.

00:44.506 --> 00:51.195
I mean, I was in, you know, the press obviously knew I was interested in China, and usually wrote about China.

00:52.497 --> 00:56.582
And it did seem to me looking for ideas that the press might pursue.

00:58.317 --> 01:06.629
that one of the areas where there's so much exciting work going on is on the intersection of texts and archaeology and art.

01:06.649 --> 01:13.979
Somehow the new archaeological discoveries in China were illuminating all kinds of things about the past.

01:15.301 --> 01:26.316
Yale had this terrific tradition by Trump by working with the volumes by Casey Zhang on Chinese archaeology in particular, and had a

01:27.190 --> 01:39.321
had a prior arrangement, I guess, with Professor Zhang to introduce some interesting books, often written originally in Chinese, into English through the press.

01:40.943 --> 01:48.990
And then we had a considerable experience publishing catalogues of various kinds, which is art books is one of the great strengths of the press.

01:49.010 --> 01:54.075
And I think that's fairly built up with the British Art Centre and the Melbourne Foundation.

01:54.292 --> 01:58.918
I think probably in Chester Kerr's days, and it was strongly after John Ryden, which continued.

01:58.938 --> 02:21.349
So it seemed to me there was some kind of logical linkage here, but it was actually John Ryden who pursued that with, I guess, interested donors and friends of the press, and then arranged for an administrator of this series.

02:21.369 --> 02:23.472
And then I think we can say that the series ran into

02:23.705 --> 02:38.621
at the level of defining what he was trying to do and actually some of the managerial problems that surfaced during this.

02:39.002 --> 02:40.245
It was essentially, I think,

02:42.892 --> 02:46.235
There wasn't very tight control over exactly what it was.

02:46.256 --> 02:46.676
It was anyway.

02:47.156 --> 02:55.705
I don't think it was, but I wasn't, I mean, I was listed as an advisor, but rather a advisor.

02:55.725 --> 03:03.133
I don't think we had perhaps a careful enough plan of what to go for.

03:03.153 --> 03:09.760
Inasmuch as I'd made an aim, but I think I'd suggested, but I can't remember how long ago this was, that

03:11.512 --> 03:33.216
one might have a sort of a Yale translation of the Chinese classics in some way, so that students of the future might be told by that teacher, oh good, the Yale edition of the Book of Changes, or the Yale edition of the early poetry text, maybe thinking a bit of the great Harvard series of

03:33.922 --> 04:01.397
in the Loeb library for the Greek and classical works. Yeah that's a great question. But it wasn't, I never felt focused and it never worked out. I think it...so difficult. Did you start with facing text as well? Well, that was part of the idea, possible, this was only a sketch.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.005
So I think it took a life of its own.

04:05.025 --> 04:13.954
It went into one or two very large format, very comprehensive art book.

04:14.214 --> 04:19.960
Yeah, but I think as a coherent series, it didn't quite come together.

04:20.020 --> 04:30.051
And my understanding is that John Donatich made the decision that it was not sustainable in the current form.

04:30.267 --> 04:35.513
And we should maybe spin it off to other interested parties.

04:35.533 --> 04:42.321
I think the original concept was for the next 75, 80, and large engines, and now they're talking 10.

04:42.481 --> 04:43.502
It was too ambitious.

04:43.642 --> 04:52.652
And now they're going to focus on individual art forms, sculpture, architecture, painting, and so on.

04:52.672 --> 04:57.878
And that, I think... The other idea was to have a real ongoing kind of...

04:58.482 --> 05:03.831
a true exchange of ideas with scholars in China and the scholars in either the U.S.

05:03.931 --> 05:06.555
or Europe or elsewhere.

05:06.575 --> 05:10.521
And I think that sometimes happens, but not in a systematic way.

05:10.541 --> 05:18.414
Is it the kind of thing, you used the phrase, too ambitious, you think it was too ambitious, and I guess there's a parallel question.

05:18.434 --> 05:22.701
Is it the kind of project that the university press or Yale University press

05:23.339 --> 05:25.121
It should be attempted, or is it to admit?

05:25.141 --> 05:29.766
Well, it was... I guess you don't know what's going to work until you try it.

05:30.006 --> 05:37.254
But this was a big, this was a... This is a big, but it was never... I think the ground rules weren't defined adequately.

05:37.274 --> 05:37.775
We didn't.

05:38.475 --> 05:44.762
Because in Chinese textual tradition, you have sort of what look like great key texts.

05:44.782 --> 05:51.169
But the point is, those are enmeshed in a huge sea of scholarly commentary,

05:51.858 --> 05:55.543
and analysis, you know, spanning 2,000 years or more.

05:55.603 --> 06:02.233
These are very often texts compiled between maybe the 7th and the 4th century BCE.

06:03.495 --> 06:06.659
So you have many, many decisions to make.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.425
Even what, you know, it's easy in a brief lunch to say, let's do this text.

06:11.426 --> 06:15.432
What is hard is to say who defines what that text is.

06:15.452 --> 06:18.716
Because it's like any great commentary tradition.

06:19.558 --> 06:21.240
It keeps complicating itself.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.984
And the more scholarly you get, the more you find the text is problematic.

06:27.385 --> 06:39.497
And so, is it possible it more just to have maybe something like Confucius's Analects, which has been translated dozens of times anyway, but it's probably one of the basic texts, so to speak.

06:40.138 --> 06:47.685
And yet again, there are variants of this, there are different dates, there are different emendations, there are different analyses.

06:47.725 --> 06:51.008
You know, it's a complicated world, and

06:52.220 --> 06:55.646
I think it was too much for us.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.529
Was that the goal in the original?

06:57.549 --> 06:58.110
Sorry?

06:58.150 --> 07:00.714
Was that the initial goal of the film?

07:00.794 --> 07:08.607
Well, in as much as I had a sketch for an idea, which I didn't think ever even got into writing, it was just sort of conversational.

07:09.769 --> 07:15.679
Maybe there was room, you know, for a grand series that would be the Yale series, you know.

07:17.296 --> 07:20.821
The Thomas More collection, or the Jonathan Edwards collection.

07:20.841 --> 07:33.799
Yeah, that's strictly a textual element, but you're saying it would also have involved the architectural and the artistic... Well, that was sort of floating around at the same time, and somehow the two, I think, got drawn together for a period of time.

07:36.263 --> 07:41.590
But again, I don't think the artistic side was coordinated with the textual side.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.653
So what is something like this generating form?

07:43.673 --> 07:46.898
I mean, is it part of the political climate of the time, or...?

07:47.401 --> 07:52.408
Is there a thirst for more knowledge on China?

07:53.510 --> 07:55.032
Were there market studies?

07:55.052 --> 08:05.947
I know that's probably a dirty word in university press publishing, but did they feel that perhaps there was an audience or a readership for this material at this particular point?

08:05.967 --> 08:12.857
I think the press, I mean, is always aware of the presence or lack of some kind of an audience.

08:13.317 --> 08:15.180
I mean, they do need to have that.

08:15.818 --> 08:18.321
People read their books, and it's possible to buy them.

08:19.623 --> 08:25.891
Maybe not on the scale of trade publishers, but even non-profits have to break even in some way or another.

08:26.332 --> 08:40.290
And the press has very often paid for itself by the success of two or three titles, which can carry a lot of much lower-selling monographic studies.

08:40.642 --> 08:44.747
This is decision for the board and the director of the press.

08:44.807 --> 08:46.950
We do many, many ventures every year.

08:48.512 --> 08:52.476
You know, we're well over a hundred books, covering an enormous range.

08:52.497 --> 08:53.858
Oh, I think it's over two.

08:53.878 --> 08:58.604
Yeah, each list of the spring and my fall, I think, is a hundred or more.

08:58.624 --> 08:59.906
And so that's it.

08:59.926 --> 09:06.394
They've got very, very good stuff, and some projects come to brilliant fruition, and others, I think, get stalled.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.058
I think if you're saying, was this kind of riding a...

09:10.848 --> 09:15.214
a somewhat emergent China boom or China expansion.

09:15.234 --> 09:15.994
I think that's true.

09:16.035 --> 09:17.496
There was a lot of interest in China.

09:17.516 --> 09:37.041
We got a strong program here that covers language and the social sciences and humanities, art, religion, a very good, a whole range of language teaching, textbook production, you know, so it fitted in a

09:37.814 --> 09:41.057
on paper into some of our ongoing concerns.

09:41.558 --> 09:44.521
Do you feel is it just a general rule?

09:44.541 --> 09:49.767
I mean, I've written a lot about special collections in libraries, which is my fundamental interest.

09:49.907 --> 09:58.136
And as a general rule, you like to say, well, the collections kind of support the curriculum, generally speaking.

09:58.376 --> 10:05.644
I don't personally feel necessarily that if you have an opportunity to get a great special collection, you should not get it because you don't have a course in it.

10:05.962 --> 10:12.730
But do you think that the university press should more or less function in a similar kind of a way?

10:12.871 --> 10:16.755
I think a university press does two things at once.

10:18.157 --> 10:35.158
To some extent it follows current interest and to another extent it fosters scholarly areas that it thinks are promising and may be likely to expand or an area where they think they've located a

10:35.881 --> 10:41.449
a scholar who would give strong leadership for a particular line of publishing.

10:41.469 --> 10:43.793
It might be a new zone.

10:43.833 --> 10:54.909
You might go into works on child psychiatry, for instance, aware that this was a field that didn't quite have a strong identity with a particular press.

10:55.991 --> 11:05.685
You might decide to go into impressionist and post-impressionist painting on a really large way, you know, so you became sort of simply the best,

11:06.442 --> 11:08.764
first thing to do is look at the Yale list.

11:10.586 --> 11:28.141
But as both all the directors I've known, as Chester Kerr and John Ryden and my John Donatage, at the same time, they're trying to keep a viable list across the whole, you know, across the fields that were already strong.

11:28.301 --> 11:36.448
So innovation is involved, sometimes buying the rights to a great series, like, for instance, Pevner's English

11:37.036 --> 11:41.562
architecture series and art.

11:41.582 --> 11:55.661
There's a world-famous scholar with a series of books that became, a list that became available, and I think the press very shrewdly said, wanted to keep these in print, and figured there was a continuing market.

11:56.602 --> 11:57.703
Scholarship's hard to gauge.

11:57.763 --> 12:03.651
Eighty-year-old scholarship can seem as current today, or it can be hopelessly

12:04.677 --> 12:06.860
outmoded, and you try and juggle it.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.244
They're going to buy the rights to pass titles.

12:09.264 --> 12:20.541
That's, of course, a publishing decision for anybody, whether it's from the American Library or Vintage, or, you know, they all have to make some kind of decision like that.

12:20.562 --> 12:23.186
Now, you've been here for a good while.

12:23.286 --> 12:24.207
A good long time.

12:24.448 --> 12:26.290
I came as a student in 59.

12:27.933 --> 12:30.617
So you've actually been here while so much is

12:31.998 --> 12:36.985
changed, and while the press in particular has won, I think you've been involved with it for a number of years.

12:37.166 --> 12:37.686
Yeah, yeah.

12:37.706 --> 12:43.375
I used to be on the Publications Committee, where Chester Kerr invited me to join.

12:44.557 --> 12:47.000
And that was very exciting, and a great committee.

12:48.943 --> 12:54.572
We'd read a lot, and we argued and talked a lot about the books, and it was just very stimulating, I love Chester.

12:54.592 --> 12:56.134
Can you tell me a little bit about that?

12:56.154 --> 13:00.300
I mean, he was a different person from... Chester Kerr was a kind of...

13:04.330 --> 13:09.294
I think it's sort of, in a way, a kind of publishing visionary and a perfectionist.

13:10.395 --> 13:19.523
He had, I think, very strong views of how Yale might create a sort of world-class university press.

13:20.864 --> 13:23.486
He'd come, I think, what was it, Tickton Field, I think?

13:23.606 --> 13:26.689
I'm not sure it was Tickton Field.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.631
Maybe that's where he went later.

13:29.111 --> 13:30.893
But he'd had publishing experience.

13:30.913 --> 13:33.595
He'd had strong connections with Yale.

13:34.469 --> 14:03.328
And so I think my memory of Chester Curry is largely just him going for quality, just wanting to make sure that inadequate books were not slipping by the system, that the Publications Committee really would, with his own staff, the editorial staff, would really read carefully manuscripts that were coming in, and would try and decide not just on the basis of current senior faculty handing in a manuscript,

14:03.967 --> 14:11.094
Though he felt that was important to try and keep Yale's faculty publishing with the press.

14:11.114 --> 14:16.860
And I must confess I tended to go elsewhere for the publication.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.422
But that was a private decision of mine.

14:20.083 --> 14:33.096
But so you both try and get the local faculty and you try and really scan the world of learning out there to try and find

14:34.645 --> 14:53.669
I think Chester had a sense of where great strengths might lie, and I think history was one of them, English literature was one of them, the great collections, even, but also doing some modern writing, the Younger Poets series and so on, trying to keep some... Which is a fabulous program.

14:53.689 --> 14:54.270
Yeah, it's been great.

14:54.290 --> 14:58.456
I already had a Chester-John Hollander about that, and... Yeah, John would know this.

14:58.916 --> 15:03.202
I just, I just feel that American poetry owes so much to the Yale series.

15:03.222 --> 15:03.522
Yeah.

15:03.940 --> 15:08.646
But so Chester was just enormously lively.

15:08.806 --> 15:12.130
He was, as I said, he exasperated a good many people.

15:12.811 --> 15:15.474
And he, the press was an extension of himself, too, I think.

15:15.595 --> 15:16.496
I think in some ways.

15:17.237 --> 15:22.303
But he also looked, he saw himself in a continuity of fine publishers, you know.

15:23.104 --> 15:25.427
I think he wanted it for the best press in the States.

15:26.909 --> 15:29.492
I don't think he was a modest man.

15:30.232 --> 15:35.580
As soon as the British Art Centre came, you know, he saw the possibilities of linkage here.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.024
Which is, I think, a perception.

15:38.044 --> 15:39.886
I mean, it was almost insightful.

15:40.788 --> 15:42.070
But it wasn't inevitable.

15:42.390 --> 15:50.522
Somebody had to make the decision to really begin thinking how we might publish great art books that would also be academically very strong.

15:51.003 --> 15:55.089
Of course, I thought that Yale would take over the field, as in my view they have.

15:55.129 --> 15:57.673
And I see a lot of books as a reviewer.

15:57.755 --> 15:58.977
They're superb.

15:59.237 --> 16:00.359
They're superb books.

16:00.519 --> 16:06.767
And then I think he was very interested in expanding Yale Press in London.

16:06.787 --> 16:08.249
Which is a story into itself.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.092
Which is a complete story.

16:10.653 --> 16:15.079
But so that... That is actually an independent kind of unit.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.642
It works very fine, particularly under Nichol.

16:17.762 --> 16:19.745
It was a very... Well, I'll be interviewing him.

16:19.765 --> 16:20.486
I'll be going over this.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.852
Well, he... I mean, that was... Those were great days in London.

16:24.872 --> 16:25.753
And so he...

16:26.088 --> 16:44.567
Again, Chester loved the whole idea of having offices as possible in Bloomsbury Square and linking, you know, Yale and London and this kind of thing, partly intellectual, partly social, partly just the sheer delight of global interconnections in this way.

16:44.587 --> 16:52.855
So I found him enormous fun to work with, and it was a committee that had awesome members, you know, much senior to me, so I felt like that.

16:54.050 --> 16:58.317
For a junior person, it was really a great chance to learn.

16:58.337 --> 17:06.370
People like them, Woodward and Ted Litz and Bob Dahl and Juan Linz.

17:06.390 --> 17:09.155
It was an amazing, amazing group of people.

17:09.175 --> 17:11.058
And you talk about the Yale faculty.

17:11.138 --> 17:15.726
I mean, Yale has remarkable writers here.

17:17.509 --> 17:21.475
When you participate in these meetings, is it a goal to try and

17:24.593 --> 17:26.214
bring a lot of these writers in.

17:26.234 --> 17:30.458
You mentioned in your own instance you have gone more or less to the trade.

17:30.478 --> 17:32.320
And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that.

17:32.500 --> 17:37.425
This is my first academic press title, by the way.

17:37.805 --> 17:40.087
Five for Harpers and Two for Holt.

17:40.447 --> 17:46.913
This is really going to be a revelation for me working in this kind of a... I don't know what to expect, but it'll be interesting.

17:46.933 --> 17:47.274
Yeah.

17:48.555 --> 17:52.018
I guess I got interested long ago in the

17:53.045 --> 17:58.890
something to do with the interconnection between scholarship and a more general readership.

17:59.231 --> 18:04.195
And I used to ask myself why scholarship had to be arcane.

18:06.097 --> 18:08.840
And that may be the wrong question, but that's how I phrased it to myself.

18:09.661 --> 18:21.091
Maybe it would be possible to, instead of spending years and years and years on the research and then just trying to write it and get somebody to take it, suppose you spend half the time on the research and then half the time on the writing.

18:21.652 --> 18:22.933
And really concentrate on

18:23.909 --> 18:33.642
shut yourself away and go down and do it, you know, just do it, to the very limits of your ability, and then see who wanted to publish it and who wanted to read it.

18:34.643 --> 18:49.022
And so, without that being quite that self-conscious, I, uh, suddenly it was publishers approaching me, and, uh, the first to do that was Little Brown, and then after that was Knopf.

18:50.133 --> 18:53.077
And some later it was Viking Henry.

18:53.558 --> 18:55.540
But a lot of this was personalities of editors.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.323
I got involved in a different world.

18:57.984 --> 19:02.690
I continued, I believe, to be a loyal member of the publication screening.

19:03.571 --> 19:14.926
But my own work began to gather readership in so-called trade houses, began to be reviewed in journals where perhaps academic books aren't usually reviewed.

19:16.128 --> 19:19.853
And then, you just named some of them, just...

19:20.356 --> 19:32.110
Well, I, you know, early, one, two very helpful early reviews were from Time, from the New York Times itself.

19:32.130 --> 19:32.530
TLS.

19:32.550 --> 19:34.433
TLS, maybe not so much.

19:34.733 --> 19:35.253
New York Reviews.

19:35.274 --> 19:49.350
Because I was mainly, I was mainly in the States, New York Review, and some of this, I guess, was straightforwardly financial, because, you know,

19:49.938 --> 19:51.820
That's not a dirty word in my lexicon.

19:51.900 --> 20:03.810
It's not in my... I mean, I used to wonder, and... Well, the press now does approach the complex question of advances with... but still with caution.

20:03.990 --> 20:06.572
We had a conversation before I agreed to do this.

20:06.813 --> 20:18.983
Yeah, well, John Ryden would have to... I think John and... John Ryden and John John Fitch have faced this, and academic writers now perhaps

20:19.790 --> 20:20.812
are being offered more.

20:20.872 --> 20:23.836
Trade houses are coming into scholarly publishing.

20:23.896 --> 20:25.900
Scholar publishing is going into trade.

20:26.581 --> 20:28.664
It's more blurred, I think, than it used to be.

20:29.946 --> 20:38.599
And sometimes somebody just writes absolutely wonderfully clearly, and publishers will be most depressed, and the book does wonderfully well, and that's good.

20:40.362 --> 20:46.692
Other times one tries to... I don't believe in trying to

20:47.887 --> 20:56.460
popularize such, I believe, in trying to write in such a way that any person of education can understand it.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.161
Excessively?

20:57.702 --> 20:58.763
Excessively, yes.

20:58.783 --> 21:00.406
Are you looking for narrative when you're writing?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.048
These words are hard to define.

21:02.068 --> 21:05.373
I've always looked for narrative in my writing.

21:05.393 --> 21:07.536
That's the trick, I think, right there.

21:07.656 --> 21:08.598
Always.

21:08.698 --> 21:12.023
Tell the story, and as a story, it doesn't matter what the subject matter.

21:12.043 --> 21:14.046
That seems to be how I'm constipated.

21:14.988 --> 21:21.117
But so this is shifting, you know, between the press and my personal interest in writing.

21:21.197 --> 21:21.518
Which is fine.

21:21.538 --> 21:22.860
I'm interested in this.

21:23.641 --> 21:28.969
And I would guess that many writers and scholars at Yale or elsewhere face this.

21:29.029 --> 21:29.569
I'm sure they do.

21:30.651 --> 21:31.152
I knew they do.

21:31.472 --> 21:35.538
I mean, so it's a question of how you want to market your work.

21:35.558 --> 21:43.510
And then if you go to, as I did for some books, go to Norton, then again, you get a very...

21:44.013 --> 21:58.666
publisher who is enormously skilled professional and has an extraordinarily good sense of where what is called a textbook might be allowed to grow, you know, stylistically in terms of market and so on.

21:58.686 --> 22:11.978
So I feel I've had quite a lot of fun, you know, working with different publishers, sometimes following editors, sometimes following the house, you know, it's dependent.

22:12.818 --> 22:13.959
different factors.

22:15.101 --> 22:21.870
Have you brought this attitude to bear when you sit in the Publications Committee, having your attitude towards writing and the accessibility?

22:22.230 --> 22:23.712
Well, we would all talk about it.

22:23.732 --> 22:25.094
Things that you're looking for?

22:25.975 --> 22:42.336
We would all talk about it, and then later, after Publications Committee, then eventually I got asked to be on the board, and that is more like long-range planning and whether to have a new building and this kind of thing, but also long-range strategy.

22:42.620 --> 22:46.185
How does one keep financially viable?

22:46.205 --> 22:48.329
How do you keep a strong list?

22:48.349 --> 22:58.985
And the press, you know, through acquisition editors, this whole side is not one I'm truly familiar with.

22:59.005 --> 23:02.971
Obviously, I think we use acquisition editors more adventurously now.

23:02.991 --> 23:10.382
We try and find people who've written really fine books who might come back.

23:11.307 --> 23:25.220
sometimes synthesize a lot of scholarly work for the press, you know, do maybe a 150, 200-page summation of a scholarly career, reflections on a scholarly life, this kind of thing.

23:25.941 --> 23:31.206
We'll still be research, we'll be talking about research procedures.

23:31.226 --> 23:33.948
So there seems to be plenty of motion here.

23:33.968 --> 23:37.191
I mean, there are many other good university parties to it that we try.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.234
I think we've been quite...

23:41.783 --> 23:49.593
ambitious and maybe too ambitious in trying to be the best press.

23:49.654 --> 23:52.778
Well, I mean, that cries to be followed up on.

23:52.978 --> 23:57.003
Well, where do you think that presses are too ambitious, perhaps?

23:57.023 --> 24:10.221
Well, how many books to publish is one of the very difficult questions, because some of the presses with enormous reach and maybe the largest resources

24:11.028 --> 24:15.695
published many, many hundreds of books here, many times more than we do.

24:15.715 --> 24:24.228
And so there was a decision about where does scale intersect with your view of quality and so on.

24:24.248 --> 24:30.116
How many books can be well edited with a staff of ex-editors?

24:30.136 --> 24:34.743
How much responsibility can we give editors of the various divisions of learning?

24:34.763 --> 24:39.330
And the press has redefined, John Donatage has redefined that, tried to

24:39.766 --> 24:44.591
come up with categories in which we should be concentrating.

24:46.614 --> 24:59.768
And he thinks the books that fall outside those categories should probably only be sought after if they can, you know, if there's some new kind of clustering that is emerging here.

24:59.788 --> 25:02.191
And this, to me, I think is a very interesting idea.

25:03.533 --> 25:09.199
The board has a lot of trade publishers on it, and they're extremely successful people.

25:09.787 --> 25:18.517
It also has academics on it, and people who had experience in university press work as well.

25:18.537 --> 25:23.002
I mean, for instance, people from Norton on it, or Harper's.

25:23.062 --> 25:25.164
I published with Harper's, I think, Jane Friedman.

25:25.204 --> 25:26.746
Yeah, right.

25:26.886 --> 25:34.855
And so there are some extremely fine publishers on the board who are willing to think these problems through with us.

25:34.875 --> 25:35.676
It is interesting, then,

25:36.044 --> 25:40.292
press for two or three years consecutively now is operating on the black.

25:40.312 --> 25:40.692
It's profitable.

25:40.712 --> 25:41.414
It's profitable.

25:41.875 --> 25:41.975
Yeah.

25:41.995 --> 25:46.062
Which is almost unique among university presses.

25:46.082 --> 25:47.304
I mean, maybe Oxford.

25:47.324 --> 25:51.051
I think it's... I wonder how many others are there.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.455
Yeah, well, I think they've really worked on that.

25:53.516 --> 26:00.448
I mean, they've had to work on trying to develop an endowment as well.

26:00.800 --> 26:08.633
And we've had some generous donors helping with publication of young authors, for instance.

26:10.676 --> 26:20.973
Other sides of that would include sometimes being able to give them some larger advance if you think it's really worth it.

26:20.993 --> 26:23.117
So all these different things integrated there.

26:23.637 --> 26:24.399
Oh, is that the phone?

26:24.439 --> 26:26.402
No, my wife, I think she said she'll get it upstairs.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.602
I may have to get a call further soon.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.364
Okay, just give me a heads up.

26:32.686 --> 26:33.126
It's okay.

26:33.286 --> 26:33.947
I'm not sure.

26:34.287 --> 26:36.430
We got a call coming from Hong Kong.

26:36.490 --> 26:39.273
We've been 15 or 20 minutes there.

26:39.353 --> 26:40.054
Just carry on.

26:40.074 --> 26:40.734
I mean, I'll try.

26:40.814 --> 26:41.755
Oh, we're doing wonderful.

26:41.815 --> 26:43.317
And what I wanted was a conversation.

26:43.357 --> 26:45.179
I really didn't come with any kind of agenda.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.841
Yeah, okay, okay.

26:46.861 --> 26:51.546
I'm hoping to do maybe 15 or 20 interviews, and...

26:52.488 --> 26:58.695
create a kind of a critical mass of stuff, and then they figure out what the hell I'm going to do with it.

26:58.715 --> 27:06.023
I told John, you know, I know there are expectations for a book that is kind of a selective history of the press.

27:07.204 --> 27:11.308
It's either going to be a snoozer, you know, or some book.

27:11.689 --> 27:15.333
And I said, I basically write books that I expect to be read, you know.

27:15.693 --> 27:22.140
My goal was to come in here and to write a book that people in the industry are going to say, this is pretty good, this is interesting.

27:22.222 --> 27:24.305
And that's the goal for me.

27:24.325 --> 27:27.969
I mean, to actually write a book that's killed out.

27:28.530 --> 27:32.155
Such an arcane subject that is going to command attention.

27:32.175 --> 27:32.555
We'll see.

27:33.316 --> 27:35.659
No, that seems a good ambition.

27:35.679 --> 27:38.363
But it's not just a puff book.

27:38.663 --> 27:39.004
No, no.

27:39.124 --> 27:40.245
I mean, I am.

27:40.405 --> 27:49.377
I'm not avoiding the... I know they're sensitive about this China thing.

27:50.892 --> 27:52.053
Why be sensitive about it?

27:52.093 --> 27:56.438
I mean, you have your ups, you have your downs, and everything can't be a home run, you know.

27:56.658 --> 27:59.541
Right, right.

27:59.561 --> 28:04.966
But still, there may be angles of that, but then the director of the press can reflect on it.

28:04.986 --> 28:06.347
I think so, yeah.

28:06.367 --> 28:09.230
It could be, yeah.

28:09.250 --> 28:19.000
I suppose a lot of that had to do with the availability of money that was coming from foundations or whatever.

28:19.020 --> 28:20.882
I think the money was there to cover

28:21.065 --> 28:21.946
what we were doing.

28:21.966 --> 28:24.350
It wasn't necessarily to cover what was projected.

28:24.370 --> 28:29.176
But again, I was not in on the financial decisions.

28:29.196 --> 28:29.997
I was in on that.

28:30.017 --> 28:38.950
I mean, I was asked about the decision to cut back, and I said, in view of what I'd been told about the situation, that was probably a good idea.

28:39.170 --> 28:50.886
I mean, but this had a lot to do with, and I'm not privy to it, I haven't explored it, but personalities, I guess, people who were here are no longer here, and that kind of thing.

28:51.912 --> 28:56.296
I don't see that getting a... This is about a 50,000-word manuscript.

28:57.097 --> 29:08.048
This is not a 50,000-word manuscript, so I have to think of it in terms of just how much attention you have to give to a certain thing.

29:08.068 --> 29:08.188
Sure.

29:08.208 --> 29:16.055
Well, I mean, there may be a story in the projects that did not completely take off.

29:16.136 --> 29:16.236
Yeah.

29:16.256 --> 29:17.136
Well, can you think of it?

29:17.157 --> 29:17.957
I mean, we look at it.

29:17.977 --> 29:18.798
We look... I don't know.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.801
I'm trying to think.

29:21.916 --> 29:31.212
some of the great collections of letters and essays and so on, you know, some of them did get either bogged down or they began to just expand more and more and more.

29:31.974 --> 29:36.482
Because I have asked these questions, you know, what are some of the ones that got away or that you regret having?

29:36.502 --> 29:44.616
Well, I think the ones that just sort of got somewhat trapped or the press got somewhat trapped in the need for more and more

29:45.187 --> 30:00.042
volumes that have been very, very handsomely published, but, you know, the idea of completion, something like the Thomas More project, or something like the Edwards, or the Walpole project, you know, these are moments.

30:00.062 --> 30:03.585
Well, if no more went forever, but there are only so many Lefty Lewis's who work.

30:03.625 --> 30:04.266
Exactly.

30:04.366 --> 30:12.814
If you get a dedicated scholar who can help support or subsidize this, then of course you have a lot going for you.

30:13.807 --> 30:31.792
And I think Yale Press has done, like Yale faculty, particularly maybe until the 1960s, maybe even the 70s, did very well from having some scholars with access to quite large sums of money, whether family or foundation, I think it might be a private.

30:33.855 --> 30:36.439
And the idea of a faculty member

30:37.617 --> 30:46.989
being really at home in London auction houses and so on, and snapping up any manuscript by X or Y, was very much established here.

30:47.009 --> 31:03.569
And a shrine to a lot of that is the Beinecke, you know, which is... And then another grand example is the British Art Center, with all the documentation that backs it up, that there's an enormous amount of manuscripts.

31:03.589 --> 31:07.354
But of course the Beinecke really doesn't intersect that much with the press, though, doesn't it?

31:07.520 --> 31:16.208
Not with the press, but it does with the collectors and the idea of the faculty as collectors and as scholars.

31:16.228 --> 31:21.233
I don't know, it's possible that we could intersect more with the Beinock.

31:21.253 --> 31:25.177
You know, we depend on the kind of project or the kind of addition.

31:25.797 --> 31:29.361
I would have thought that it would be a natural.

31:29.641 --> 31:36.227
I mean, just the way the Belmap Press was established at Harvard, not that it necessarily followed their route, but one of the ideas

31:36.460 --> 31:48.295
was that this money would be used to publish things, unpublished, to publish things previously unpublished in the Houghton collections or wherever, you know, and I don't know if that's necessary.

31:48.315 --> 31:52.120
Well, Frank Turner would be, probably, I'm sure he's not going to live there.

31:52.320 --> 31:57.667
He'd be very helpful on this, and I think Jerry Pelican would be full of ideas about this.

31:58.248 --> 31:59.930
He's not, well, unfortunately.

31:59.950 --> 32:00.291
Is he not?

32:00.311 --> 32:00.491
He can't.

32:00.511 --> 32:05.117
He's not doing interviews, and I just don't think I'm very...

32:05.333 --> 32:08.837
Well, I'm glad to hear.

32:08.857 --> 32:17.946
In fact, my editor, Harper's work with him, he's just been doing a huge series of books.

32:17.966 --> 32:18.126
Amazing.

32:18.587 --> 32:20.989
I'm hoping that he'll change his mind.

32:21.750 --> 32:27.556
I'd love to talk to him, even if it's just for half an hour.

32:27.816 --> 32:33.822
He, to me, symbolizes the kind of changing goals and ambitions of the press.

32:34.578 --> 32:42.707
somebody who's been extremely steadfast, I think, in publishing with the press, though he's also published elsewhere.

32:42.727 --> 32:48.072
But he's been a powerful figure on the board and the Publications Committee for a huge amount of time.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.794
So, by the way, was Don Lamb.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.539
I don't know if you've talked to Don.

32:54.579 --> 32:54.639
No.

32:54.879 --> 33:01.446
And there, the intersection of trade and scholarly press was very, very strong.

33:01.586 --> 33:02.307
And he was a very

33:03.535 --> 33:06.118
I think, sort of devoted chairman of the world.

33:06.598 --> 33:15.367
Do you have a good, sound, right sense of what a university press is or should be, and whether or not Yale approaches this ideal?

33:15.847 --> 33:31.703
Well, I think one of the things it should be is the guardian of genuine standards, of excellence, and kind of a way of making

33:32.138 --> 33:38.845
something based on true research scholarship available.

33:38.865 --> 33:50.498
One could add in that to professionals, or one could bracket that and say to the interested public, and there's, of course, an enormous difference there.

33:51.720 --> 33:59.428
But I think the keeper of really strong standards to try the attempt not to publish books that have

34:01.197 --> 34:13.817
enormous gaps in their evidential structures, you know, to have books, maybe have speculative books at intervals, but that are declared to be speculative.

34:13.937 --> 34:17.443
Obviously you can have amazingly vigorous people.

34:17.963 --> 34:20.247
Could you give me an example of a speculative?

34:20.668 --> 34:29.061
Well, maybe a book by Steiner, for instance, on intellectual theory,

34:29.834 --> 34:42.673
or by the art historian and philosopher.

34:43.815 --> 34:49.743
I'm blanking on the name.

34:49.944 --> 34:55.912
Where about that?

34:55.932 --> 34:57.715
Not Planofsky, but... No, I'm blanking on that.

34:57.998 --> 35:15.302
Have there been any books in particular that you've championed to the press, if you take a special degree of satisfaction in having... I think there'd be quite... I probably wouldn't put my name without any one particular book, because this is usually a sort of group process.

35:15.322 --> 35:23.113
It's sort of a group process in which we would meet as a publications committee, and then we would swap views with the editors.

35:24.275 --> 35:25.997
And I don't want to think of myself, you know...

35:27.327 --> 35:30.732
pushing any particular stable or roster of writers.

35:31.594 --> 35:37.042
I think, in my case, it was more trying to evaluate things I got asked to evaluate.

35:37.062 --> 35:38.404
And I'm still asked.

35:38.424 --> 35:43.532
And sometimes these are books that one has some real worries about.

35:45.335 --> 35:52.346
And one is trusted, I think, to share that with the colleagues or with the editors and so on.

35:52.366 --> 35:55.731
Sometimes those worries may be overwritten.

35:57.314 --> 35:59.756
not important.

35:59.776 --> 36:06.782
And it's difficult to know, I mean, some people are, that's why Jerry is a real polymath, you know, I don't feel I am in that same way.

36:07.142 --> 36:26.359
And it depends how many zones of discipline you can read, you know, John Hollander is that sort of a polymath, just a wonderful, huge mind, you know, that can, I think David Bromwich is like that, and certainly David Bromwich would have some very good views on this.

36:26.930 --> 36:32.096
because he's got a strong mind, I think.

36:34.478 --> 36:47.172
And so different people have had perhaps a bit more influence in building up some particular subsection of publishing within the press.

36:49.554 --> 36:55.941
I mean, I haven't for instance seen it as my job to, coming back to the original question,

36:56.427 --> 37:00.652
push lots and lots of Chinese studies, Chinese history.

37:00.672 --> 37:03.895
If there is something good that's sent in, I'll look at it.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.980
If I'm asked, I won't demand to look at it.

37:08.000 --> 37:22.355
And if I have something that I hear of, I might send it, at least send the name of the author to the history editor and say, I really like this manuscript, you might want to take a look.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.937
But, I mean, I was there in a

37:24.271 --> 37:33.662
I guess in as much as the Publications Committee has fairly demarcated slots for the various years I was there, it was pretty much a history slot.

37:33.682 --> 37:40.850
And if you've got someone like Ben Woodward or Jerry Pelican as other, you know, you're not going to make all the decisions yourself.

37:40.910 --> 37:49.080
You're going to have a sort of a shared group, and at different times different people come and go into this position.

37:50.360 --> 38:15.912
But history, I think, has been a very strong part of the press, as it is, I don't think all around the world, whether our university press is history, but is a natural for evidential research and the possibility of presenting it in a way that can transcend a small group of devoted scholars and maybe have further public resonance.

38:17.225 --> 38:26.018
lots of press to see that, but then the whole technical side of history that are indeed arcane and are going to be accessible in a very small group.

38:26.118 --> 38:36.473
Certain kinds of quantitative history and certain kinds of linguistic history are going to be tight in that relationship.

38:36.493 --> 38:46.607
So I think I'm, I don't think I'll claim I got that for the press, you know, because I think it would always be, my feeling is it's always a group

38:47.465 --> 38:55.212
But generally, you could certainly claim enthusiasm in the sense of being proud that you published it.

38:55.472 --> 38:58.555
Proud to publish category.

38:58.575 --> 39:00.177
The press published it, yeah.

39:00.217 --> 39:06.022
Well, I mean you and the collective you, the press.

39:06.102 --> 39:17.252
If you were to pick up a little monograph that was attempting to do a centennial appreciation, I think it's much too ambitious to suggest that I could do a history of this thing.

39:17.553 --> 39:22.918
and the limitations that they've given me, which is 40,000 to 50,000 words.

39:23.538 --> 39:29.364
What would you like to see discussed and considered something like this?

39:29.384 --> 39:30.565
What are areas that you feel?

39:30.965 --> 39:37.391
I mean, Eric Gettis' history of Yale has pointedly not included the press.

39:37.411 --> 39:39.533
He said to me, you know, I'm not doing the press.

39:39.653 --> 39:41.615
I would be interested to see you do a few.

39:43.316 --> 39:47.560
What would I be remiss?

39:47.894 --> 39:51.197
And what about, do you think?

39:51.217 --> 39:54.881
Doesn't necessarily have to be a specific topic, rather specific.

39:54.901 --> 40:17.665
I guess trying to work out why it was all worth doing, whether a university press like this was able to do things that other people could not do or would not have done, and that thus they are kind of raising the discussion level in a society at large.

40:18.033 --> 40:28.824
A university press should not be perceived, in my view, as a haven for books that couldn't be published elsewhere, let's say.

40:28.844 --> 40:29.525
That could not be.

40:29.545 --> 40:32.908
It could not be published, say, in the commercial sphere.

40:33.829 --> 40:37.472
Well, I think that sometimes happens, but it shouldn't be perceived as that.

40:37.492 --> 40:42.197
No, I think that's why that's a sort of dusty view of the press.

40:42.738 --> 40:48.023
And I think Yale and some others have fought very strongly to get out of there.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.275
state locals.

40:50.676 --> 40:55.422
Some state universities might obviously favor history from their own state.

40:56.183 --> 40:58.487
That is understood in some areas.

40:58.587 --> 41:09.022
I think we are trying to be global, because we do have a faculty that has an enormous amount of disciplines, cumulatively.

41:09.042 --> 41:16.913
And so we want to use the resources that we have, I think, as I said before, to kind of

41:18.293 --> 41:32.830
keep discourse, maybe, at a very high level, and try and do things that show the intellectual life is exciting, is worth living, and is shareable.

41:33.070 --> 41:37.775
You know, it's something that can kind of enrich people.

41:38.356 --> 41:41.019
I think that would be the ultimate virtue of it.

41:41.119 --> 41:44.723
You know, I've got a lot of books to get around from

41:44.922 --> 41:54.171
in the press, but I mean, I've also gotten to lots of other places, you know, and I always wish there was more time to read them.

41:54.191 --> 41:57.534
It's hard even to read all the press's lists.

41:57.554 --> 42:00.177
I don't read all the press's lists every time.

42:00.197 --> 42:05.723
I mean, there is a view among people who should know better than a university press, not necessarily this one, exists.

42:07.044 --> 42:12.229
To publish the dissipations of its faculty, you know,

42:12.479 --> 42:16.305
And in some cases that doesn't happen here.

42:16.505 --> 42:18.448
I think it happens very little now.

42:19.329 --> 42:22.154
Occasionally a dissertation is a wonderful book.

42:22.174 --> 42:23.255
It can be a wonderful book.

42:23.496 --> 42:32.689
And I wrote my dissertation as a book, and I tend to try and direct dissertations either as books or very much potentially as books.

42:32.709 --> 42:34.973
I don't try and direct them as dissertations.

42:34.993 --> 42:39.820
I try and make them as a contribution to learning that's also accessible.

42:40.795 --> 42:46.740
But you have problems in just the sheer cost of notation, you know, is high.

42:47.160 --> 42:57.049
And again, there can be pressure to have fewer notes or to bunch them together or to have them published separately.

42:57.069 --> 42:59.811
I mean, all these discussions now are going on.

43:01.953 --> 43:05.016
How do you actually keep the annotation structure?

43:05.036 --> 43:10.060
That is what really defines a lot of academic publishing, which is that there

43:10.647 --> 43:23.360
whatever you say should be comfortably traceable by the reader so they can learn more and also look more at how you are using the source that you say you're using.

43:23.440 --> 43:32.188
So that whole factor of how you're going to reach people and how much should you spend on design?

43:33.490 --> 43:36.593
How much should you spend on graphics?

43:37.434 --> 43:38.815
What about jacket?

43:39.233 --> 43:43.977
When you come into a meeting of the board of Yale Press and the table is lined with that B.A.'

43:43.957 --> 43:47.140
's list, it's an astonishing sight.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.922
It's just an astonishing sight.

43:48.962 --> 43:55.268
A blaze of colour, a typography, and illustrations from images from all over the world.

43:55.928 --> 43:57.490
How often does that happen?

43:57.630 --> 44:08.700
Usually at every board meeting, there might be 60 or 70 books displayed from the previous list or the one that's coming or some intersection.

44:09.727 --> 44:18.016
And so there is this magnificent central room with that grand table, and there are seats all around the table for the board and the ex officio members.

44:18.557 --> 44:19.498
How often do they meet?

44:20.519 --> 44:26.887
The board at the moment is meeting three times a year, and sometimes we've met four times a year.

44:26.967 --> 44:28.148
Is it one upcoming?

44:28.709 --> 44:30.711
Yeah, at the end of October.

44:30.811 --> 44:33.094
Or maybe they'll come.

44:33.114 --> 44:34.796
October 28th, I think.

44:34.816 --> 44:36.898
They told me if they come to these things, why not?

44:37.047 --> 44:42.335
I'll try and go to those.

44:42.976 --> 44:44.518
But again, you're coming in.

44:44.558 --> 44:53.892
I mean, the mornings are, the subcommittees will meet, and I think those may not, I don't think they're really public to me, I don't know.

44:53.913 --> 45:04.168
But there is the Finance Committee, and then there's the discussion with the Publications Committee, and there's the, I guess there's the sort

45:04.756 --> 45:09.243
I can't remember the two or three subcontinues that meet in the morning, and I haven't been on those.

45:09.263 --> 45:16.273
See, one of these might make an interesting little scene built in a little book, but you never know if it's as dramatic as you're suggesting.

45:16.293 --> 45:19.497
Well, I think to see the table like that is astonishing.

45:19.778 --> 45:26.848
But then the other kind of scene that you should visit, if they don't feel it violates confidentiality, would be the actual publication.

45:26.888 --> 45:29.432
Well, basically, yesterday I can sit in.

45:29.452 --> 45:30.513
I think that was... I disagree.

45:30.554 --> 45:32.957
John's going to be my editor, so he's...

45:33.123 --> 45:36.351
Nothing embarrassing is going to get by.

45:36.372 --> 45:37.535
No, I mean that.

45:37.555 --> 45:43.771
I mean, there's only work in as much as people can be really frank about the people who have submitted books.

45:43.851 --> 45:47.200
And some of the problems come.

45:47.585 --> 45:50.988
I'm sure, in all kinds of publishing, when people won't speak their mind, frankly.

45:51.208 --> 46:01.598
Well, I mean, I think I'd go in without a tape recorder playing, but just to pick up some of the nuances of... Yeah, I think... Well, I think both the publications committee and one of the subcommittees of the board would be pretty good.

46:01.618 --> 46:03.440
Would be very much part of your story.

46:03.460 --> 46:05.381
Yeah, yeah.

46:05.401 --> 46:09.865
And give me an approach, an entry into the thing.

46:09.925 --> 46:11.207
Right, right, right.

46:11.467 --> 46:13.689
I just used to love going to those meetings.

46:13.709 --> 46:15.871
So you've been to many of these over the years?

46:15.891 --> 46:17.052
Oh, yeah, a dozen, a dozen.

46:17.369 --> 46:19.111
I have no idea how many years ago.

46:19.131 --> 46:21.654
Are they entertaining for you, or do they...?

46:21.794 --> 46:23.877
They were intellectual hard work.

46:24.338 --> 46:26.520
Yes, and entertaining.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.704
Intellectual hard work, because there is a responsibility here, isn't there?

46:29.724 --> 46:36.933
Well, they're trying to read manuscripts on many different fields, you know, and it'll depend what you're given, what you're asked to do.

46:36.953 --> 46:39.757
You could concentrate on the history ones or something different.

46:39.777 --> 46:42.260
First of all, science could say, hey, can you take a look at this?

46:42.280 --> 46:46.465
It's on, you know, maybe on the Chinese Revolution, or it may be on some

46:47.305 --> 46:54.011
aspect of liberal science that cuts across history and something you've done in the past.

46:54.031 --> 47:02.959
You can have a problematic title, they might say, look, we want several members to look at this one on history of art, because they're not quite sure what's going on here.

47:03.800 --> 47:14.109
I remember being asked to do one term history photography, not because I was a historian of photography, just because they felt I might be a good judge of what was going on.

47:14.129 --> 47:14.730
And so these

47:15.149 --> 47:18.754
That experimental side is important, I mean.

47:18.774 --> 47:21.318
And just, I'll ask you one other question.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.481
We're up to noon already, which is great.

47:23.501 --> 47:24.723
You've given me an hour of your time.

47:25.565 --> 47:26.005
Sure, sure.

47:26.025 --> 47:34.558
How do you feel about, we were talking about the scholarly apparatus and the annotations with the servo works, et cetera.

47:34.959 --> 47:40.387
How do you feel about this electronic endeavor being championed, say, by Robert Darden?

47:41.208 --> 47:43.151
I'm a champion, but he's working with it.

47:43.171 --> 47:44.633
He's trying to develop it.

47:45.068 --> 47:49.394
Well, this is the whole sort of Gutenberg-y project.

47:50.055 --> 48:01.752
I know that it's proved much more problematic than people expected, and professional associations have also worked with e-publishing.

48:01.772 --> 48:10.705
In fact, the American Historical Association has worked with electronic publishing, particularly trying to work out whether scholars can be

48:11.022 --> 48:13.766
Do you mind if I take a couple photographs, by the way?

48:13.986 --> 48:16.569
No, if you'd like.

48:16.649 --> 48:17.971
Just ignore me while you speak.

48:18.231 --> 48:19.433
Okay, okay.

48:19.453 --> 48:40.000
But anyway, the attempt to use, to try and work out whether you can help put scholarly work directly into publishable form, you know, through e-publishing, is something that, I don't know if you'd want to pursue it or not, but...

48:40.908 --> 48:44.131
Lots of members of the press, I think, have their views on this.

48:44.151 --> 48:46.933
And I'm sure Dartich has thought about it a lot.

48:47.113 --> 48:50.877
And I know John Ryden began to think about it, too, in his tenure.

48:52.959 --> 49:02.387
But I know that they proved very hard to get ready to go, and they proved very, very hard to make conveniently accessible to readers.

49:02.487 --> 49:07.752
And there's obviously, again, strong reader resistance as well.

49:07.772 --> 49:10.594
In the American Historical Association project,

49:11.806 --> 49:16.131
they failed to come up with a number of titles they hoped to come up with.

49:16.151 --> 49:28.505
That was to have some kind of intermediate zone of fairly rapidly produced email or e-ready publication, either through the Gutenberg or some other kind of project.

49:28.625 --> 49:38.937
And Columbia Press was working on this with the American Historical Association and maybe, probably other professional associations.

49:38.957 --> 49:40.699
And they would have to give you the

49:41.101 --> 49:52.513
background on all this, but what I do know is that it was not nearly as easy to do as it looked to those who were at the cutting edge of the sort of electronic world.

49:53.154 --> 50:02.183
I am nowhere near the electronic world, and I don't understand anything about it, and I would never be able to even read the books that were coming out from there.

50:02.203 --> 50:09.471
But do you think it's a viable alternative for a young doctoral candidate having trouble finding a publisher for a... Well, that's the point is... The point is,

50:09.873 --> 50:11.575
Well, may become so.

50:12.817 --> 50:24.393
And the idea of having a book before you get a job might be simply impractical in the moderately near future.

50:24.454 --> 50:38.293
I mean, for instance, you could have your dissertation in some kind of photocopy, unpublished, you know, when you got your job, but now it's probably different in that way.

50:39.725 --> 50:42.268
But it hasn't proved easy to make this jump.

50:42.288 --> 50:46.053
And I... There is a fascination with the book.

50:46.153 --> 50:47.655
You know, there's a loyalty to the book.

50:50.518 --> 50:54.783
The various other forms of reading haven't been able to really match.

50:56.685 --> 50:58.788
I still hate reading long things on the screen.

50:58.888 --> 51:00.090
I have yet to meet anyone.

51:00.110 --> 51:06.938
I was at a forum last week at the Boston Athenaeum, and they had these digital... What is the Athenaeum going to do in the next hundred years?

51:06.958 --> 51:08.820
They've got a big donor about to...

51:09.357 --> 51:14.745
commit some money to them for acquiring the building next door, and Estona was there anonymously.

51:14.785 --> 51:25.660
I've never spoken to an anonymous audience, but this one person, I mean, the trustees were there, but you know that this thing was being put together for the one person who was probably the most important one there.

51:26.481 --> 51:35.213
But I was kind of the Luddite, you know, there, who still believes that the book, the physical book, is different from the

51:36.104 --> 51:37.506
I do, too, the electronics.

51:37.546 --> 51:45.438
And so I asked the question, and I said, is there anyone in this room who has read a book from beginning to end on a computer screen?

51:45.498 --> 51:48.723
Only the guy from the National Digital Library put up his hand.

51:48.863 --> 51:51.607
I said, you don't count.

51:51.868 --> 51:57.476
You know, my eyes have gone to hell in a basket because of the terminal screens, all the work I do on a computer terminal.

51:57.496 --> 51:59.479
I just can't imagine reading a book

51:59.915 --> 52:04.361
It's going to run out of juice anyway halfway across the Atlantic Ocean, in any case.

52:04.381 --> 52:06.163
I can't do it.

52:06.343 --> 52:08.526
I'm not trying, and I don't want to.

52:08.907 --> 52:13.212
I mean, I'm using age as an example.

52:13.252 --> 52:19.340
But on the other hand, there are plenty of octogenarians who are quite happy with our little iPods.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.262
I just haven't entered that world.

52:22.224 --> 52:23.645
I've got some great pictures.

52:23.926 --> 52:27.591
I'm staying in the book, the book I can hold.

52:27.611 --> 52:29.533
I don't know.

52:31.572 --> 52:41.504
But even on the screen, I just, if I've got something longish on the screen, I just print it out and then read it in an old-fashioned way.

52:41.524 --> 52:43.707
Oh, you have a paperless society now.

52:43.727 --> 52:43.967
Yeah.

52:44.408 --> 52:46.931
You regenerate more paper now.

52:46.951 --> 52:48.352
Yeah, with thousands of sheets.

52:48.472 --> 52:49.634
I throw away every week.

52:49.654 --> 52:52.678
Thousands of sheets.

52:52.698 --> 52:52.798
Okay.

52:52.818 --> 52:54.860
Listen, I've taken up an hour of your time.

52:54.940 --> 52:55.721
You're a busy man.

52:55.821 --> 52:58.685
It was nice talking with you, and I really appreciate that.

52:58.745 --> 52:59.706
I didn't really have a...

52:59.905 --> 53:03.849
I'm just kind of finding my way right now, as you can appreciate.

53:03.869 --> 53:10.796
And, you know, they say, can you come and write a... But Bart Giamatti was a wonderful member of that.

53:10.816 --> 53:18.483
Oh, I just so, I just so grieve not being able to... We were the young students, you know, Chester Kerr, a white student.

53:18.503 --> 53:19.484
We were the young students.

53:20.345 --> 53:23.588
We were the young students.

53:23.728 --> 53:27.752
Suddenly in the midst of all this galaxy of world-famous figures.

53:28.475 --> 53:31.980
And it was a great honor for us.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.382
Well, let's just get that on tape.

53:33.463 --> 53:34.825
It's a pretty good example.

53:38.931 --> 53:39.171
Oh, no.

53:39.191 --> 53:45.441
You talk about... They were rolling again.

53:46.342 --> 53:56.878
No, I'm just saying that Chester Kerr, and I think others have tried to follow him, but Chester Kerr really successfully tried to get what he thought of as the very best.

53:57.652 --> 54:06.608
senior scholars, you know, to be on the publication screening and to come at the regular meetings and to assess what was going on.

54:06.628 --> 54:12.779
And so to be asked to join as a young faculty of Bart and I, I remember, it was just, it was literally thrilling.

54:12.799 --> 54:14.022
I mean, it was astonishing.

54:14.102 --> 54:19.912
So we felt, not exactly our best behavior, we got quite... The card being, because the tape recorder's on now Barchamati.

54:19.932 --> 54:21.415
Barchamati, yeah, yeah.

54:21.867 --> 54:32.965
And Chester Kerr finally, like two schoolboys, he told us we had to sit apart from each other because we were so disruptive by passing each other notes.

54:34.046 --> 54:38.874
So that sort of liveliness was something that the committee had.

54:39.735 --> 54:49.731
So it had some high seriousness and a lively feel to it, which is, I think, what I feel Chester Kerr himself did.

54:50.588 --> 54:58.056
the sense of intellectual inquiry at a delightful level, you know, is what pleased him, I think.

54:58.076 --> 55:06.025
What kind of an attitude or an approach did Barth bring to the... Well, this would be too hard, I think, for me to unravel across all these years.

55:06.065 --> 55:11.771
This must have been in the... I can't... I should think the early 70s.

55:13.693 --> 55:20.140
I just remember Barth being very sceptical about puffery in scholarship and...

55:21.065 --> 55:30.393
He loves spotting kind of intellectual inconsistencies in somebody's position.

55:30.514 --> 55:34.497
He was watchful about quality.

55:34.517 --> 55:37.960
It's hard to kind of recapture that extraordinary mind.

55:38.060 --> 55:48.250
Just playful, terrifically playful, and erudite, and probably a bit iconoclastic as well.

55:49.090 --> 55:49.671
And to oppress

55:50.410 --> 55:51.852
He was a very good scholar himself.

55:51.872 --> 55:53.094
He was so enamored with baseball.

55:53.174 --> 55:55.197
Yes, absolutely passionate with baseball.

55:55.278 --> 56:00.305
So he would meet every single week to talk with Harold Bloom about baseball.

56:00.325 --> 56:08.638
That was their inviolable meeting that had to take place, as they had went to a delicatessen and thrashed out the previous ones.

56:08.659 --> 56:11.703
Of course, Boone is a Yankee fan in part, because they're like myself.

56:11.763 --> 56:13.546
They're dying now at the Red Sox.

56:13.726 --> 56:14.387
Absolutely.

56:14.407 --> 56:15.629
Collapsing in the East.

56:15.649 --> 56:17.953
But these were passionate meetings, and so that

56:18.338 --> 56:22.546
That kind of enormous liveliness is what I remember him for.

56:22.566 --> 56:28.898
But it was certainly fun together.

56:29.038 --> 56:30.020
Thank you, sir.

56:30.180 --> 56:31.723
I'm very generous with your time.
