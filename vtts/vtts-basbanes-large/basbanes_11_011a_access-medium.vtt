WEBVTT

00:06.190 --> 00:09.534
There we go again.

00:10.415 --> 00:10.936
Okay, yes.

00:12.257 --> 00:13.799
Now we can start.

00:14.020 --> 00:18.105
So, Karta has been given the name by Capacita Vimalassi.

00:18.505 --> 00:31.301
As you know, he was the father of Crete Neodiputra, and he has made an honorary introduction.

00:32.102 --> 00:33.784
The book is actually...

00:34.878 --> 00:47.233
dedicated by me to the Greek of the diaspora, and it contains the contribution of Greek scholars, editors, printers, and publishers in Italy and in the West.

00:48.314 --> 01:02.151
It covers from the end of the 14th century the beginning of the relationship between the West and the East, the Byzantines and the Westerns, especially the Italians,

01:02.637 --> 01:08.243
And it goes up to the end of the 1532, around the death of Zianos Laskaris.

01:09.063 --> 01:16.751
There is an extensive index, thematically.

01:16.771 --> 01:18.993
You can find whatever you're searching.

01:19.013 --> 01:25.840
There are at least 1,000... I must have been inspired when I read it.

01:25.860 --> 01:31.986
...biographical notes about all the important people and printers and scholars of

01:32.354 --> 01:46.813
that have been worked in printing or in editing or in learning Greek language and Greek literature.

01:48.496 --> 01:52.321
So, more or less, I think it covers whatever.

01:53.042 --> 01:55.425
This will also get in the bibliography of my new book.

01:56.182 --> 02:01.871
I think it's already, as my publisher told me, at Harvard University.

02:01.891 --> 02:04.316
I saw a new edition there.

02:04.736 --> 02:06.900
You can search it right from here, by the way.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.823
I'll send you a phone number.

02:08.843 --> 02:10.987
You can call the Harvard catalog.

02:11.387 --> 02:20.282
There is also a leaflet and a map with the symbol marks of the Greek

02:20.735 --> 02:26.281
let's say, editorial activity from the 15th century to the end of the 18th century.

02:27.342 --> 02:28.664
This is all made by hand.

02:29.285 --> 02:30.566
Absolutely magnificent.

02:32.148 --> 02:38.475
May I ask, because I read this for the article, but what is the cost of this book?

02:38.495 --> 02:40.978
The cost of this book is 500 marks.

02:41.699 --> 02:42.880
Okay, that's German marks.

02:42.940 --> 02:43.941
German marks, yes.

02:47.785 --> 02:49.227
And how does a person buy it?

02:49.948 --> 02:51.891
Do they contact the publisher?

02:51.911 --> 02:54.414
They contact the publisher, yes.

02:54.735 --> 02:56.958
I'll put this in the piece, the information is in there.

02:57.018 --> 03:07.092
Yes, I will give you a small leaflet of him, because this is the leaflet of the announcement of the Greek edition, which has been published in 1989.

03:07.273 --> 03:09.936
It took me ten years to make the translation.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.140
Did you do the translation, yes sir?

03:12.160 --> 03:16.746
No, my English is not so good.

03:18.751 --> 03:32.370
What has been said, Timothy Cullen, who was a classical scholar from Oxford, has done extremely good work.

03:34.233 --> 03:48.673
The announcement of the edition is that the Greek edition was put it all in hand.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.384
Was there a limitation on the...?

03:50.404 --> 03:50.704
Yes.

03:50.945 --> 03:52.066
How many copies?

03:53.688 --> 03:54.890
It's out of print now.

03:55.050 --> 03:57.073
It's out of circulation.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.637
Is there a limitation on this one?

03:59.817 --> 04:02.220
The first edition is 700 copies.

04:04.563 --> 04:05.084
It'll sell.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.652
I'll be able to help you on this, I think, with some contacts.

04:11.814 --> 04:14.357
I'll do my very best.

04:17.847 --> 04:19.169
I know some people who buy it.

04:19.189 --> 04:21.653
I know one book sell it, a lot of ten of them.

04:21.673 --> 04:23.455
Maybe I'm wrong, but we'll see.

04:24.337 --> 04:25.478
They're not on for me.

04:26.179 --> 04:27.922
I don't have a good occasion.

04:28.783 --> 04:43.525
So, I'd say, I guess a lot of what I'm going to ask you is probably answered in that book, but I'm so interested, and I noticed on the way in, you know, the portrait of Cardinal Viserio down below.

04:43.725 --> 04:45.127
I have to tell you a funny story.

04:45.147 --> 04:46.369
When I was up at Mount Athos,

04:46.855 --> 05:03.961
at the Vardapperi Library, and the monk was asking me what I'm doing, and I'm explaining, and I said, and I was in Venice, because I forget, I'm talking to an orthodox monk, you know, and I said, and I'm going to write about Cardinal Besserio, and you look at this, the traitor, the traitor.

05:03.981 --> 05:07.086
I said, oh my God, that's right, I forgot.

05:07.106 --> 05:10.471
But it is interesting that some Greeks considered him.

05:12.574 --> 05:14.938
Continuously feeling that way.

05:15.509 --> 05:20.376
But, of course, you feel, and I feel, his significance as what?

05:20.396 --> 05:22.279
The Greeks, yes.

05:22.299 --> 05:44.672
In the letters and in the, let's say, keeping the conscience of the Greeks, that period, especially within, after the fall of Constantinople, under the 15th century, he had created a special academy in Rome where everybody was

05:44.973 --> 06:06.492
writing and copying manuscripts and selling them all over and keeping let's say a Greek flame always there and all kinds of refugees were going there and finding food and being able to be asked for many problems that they had going all around

06:06.877 --> 06:12.704
And, of course, he rescued the Greek books, and he took them out with him, which is of extraordinary.

06:12.724 --> 06:22.014
They had the two... First of all, his library was the most important private library of his time, no doubt about it, in Greek and Latin books.

06:22.034 --> 06:31.905
Then he had sent at least two or three book hunters all over the monasteries,

06:32.375 --> 06:35.300
and knowing exactly what they were looking for.

06:35.340 --> 06:42.691
They were trying to recreate a library with all the rest of the important Greek and Byzantine literature.

06:43.632 --> 06:46.096
There were not just hundreds of books.

06:46.136 --> 06:54.349
They wanted special to see and to have in the West special works that didn't exist in Italy.

06:54.802 --> 07:03.310
at all, or existed in libraries where nobody could go and find them.

07:03.330 --> 07:08.014
Do you think it's safe to say that there are Greek works that would be lost forever if it weren't for him?

07:08.154 --> 07:13.239
Oh yes, absolutely.

07:13.319 --> 07:23.408
And something else, sometimes we're talking if Greek works would be lost, sometimes a special copy is so important

07:23.641 --> 07:36.236
towards other copies that existed, because it's the most ancient one, and it's more closer to the original one, which is very, very important.

07:36.276 --> 07:39.479
Like Homerus A, for instance, is one just the same one.

07:39.499 --> 07:41.902
Like the Venetus A, yes.

07:41.922 --> 07:42.843
And many, many others.

07:43.204 --> 07:51.994
Dr. Zoysi called the Homerus A. It is the Venetus.

07:53.476 --> 07:54.417
Tell me about yourself.

07:54.537 --> 07:55.698
Are you a collector?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.160
You seem to be a total bookman.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.522
I mean, you write books, you collect them.

08:01.103 --> 08:02.604
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

08:02.624 --> 08:09.830
I know you're going to send me a CV, but... Yes.

08:10.210 --> 08:22.521
One of my special interests in the field of books is the editorial activity of the Greeks from the end of the 15th century up to 1821.

08:24.458 --> 08:36.553
I mean, all the important and less important, everything, all the centers where Greek books have been published for the Greeks.

08:36.573 --> 08:46.806
That means, of course, that I have to know also the general history of printing, European-wise.

08:46.826 --> 08:54.415
And so, but it doesn't cover just the field of way of printing or printer marks and things like that.

08:54.732 --> 09:05.766
It covers all the activity, the scholars, the writers, the distribution of the books, all this activity has to do with the books, the readers, everything.

09:05.786 --> 09:09.370
And then I have been... This is as a scholar now you're interested.

09:09.430 --> 09:12.334
Yes, yes.

09:12.354 --> 09:13.555
And then I'm sorry to interrupt you.

09:13.715 --> 09:16.939
Yes, and then it's, as I have done, two historical libraries.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.462
I have reorganized and designed them.

09:19.482 --> 09:20.824
One is the Patmos Library.

09:21.530 --> 09:24.635
which is very important, which I have to visit.

09:24.755 --> 09:26.458
I've been to five months, but not to the library.

09:26.838 --> 09:30.724
And one in the Ecumenical Patriarchal in Hanari.

09:31.526 --> 09:32.888
Now, you have redesigned them?

09:32.908 --> 09:33.088
Yes.

09:33.408 --> 09:41.421
They actually, the old one, I mean, there were the manuscripts I kept, which is very... They never opened it.

09:42.382 --> 09:47.250
So, from that point of view, I've started searching and...

09:51.348 --> 10:09.008
I did an inquiry about the history of the library in general, and my last book was a publication with the history of the library from the ancient world, from 3000 BC up to the Renaissance, and I had presented as well 40 important libraries.

10:09.289 --> 10:10.510
Is that published only in Greek?

10:10.871 --> 10:11.391
Only in Greek.

10:11.431 --> 10:16.377
The English translation is now under preparation.

10:16.677 --> 10:39.158
uh ready by the end of this year really and uh this year who's publishing it and now now i come to a very important subject that i would like to find an american publisher or to to co-publisher if you want for distribution and it's a very

10:40.066 --> 10:41.288
That's an important book.

10:41.348 --> 10:42.309
I will show you a copy.

10:42.329 --> 10:43.110
Give me the title.

10:43.471 --> 10:46.575
Tell me who's publishing it in English over here.

10:47.035 --> 10:47.896
Me.

10:47.916 --> 10:48.277
You are?

10:48.297 --> 10:48.537
Yes.

10:48.737 --> 10:49.498
Under your imprint?

10:50.139 --> 10:50.340
Yes.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.842
Stichos imprint?

10:51.922 --> 10:53.464
Not necessarily, no.

10:53.724 --> 10:56.828
As I'm the writer, I'm not really... You don't look like it.

10:56.848 --> 10:57.649
Yes.

10:57.669 --> 11:01.534
I just put the date and the place and that's all.

11:01.554 --> 11:06.481
But I'm doing all the supervision, the editorial activity, the pagination and all that.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.824
It's a very special book you'll see.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.647
And the title, what is the title?

11:11.568 --> 11:32.190
The title is Libraries from the Ancient World to the Renaissance, and 14 important... Fourteen.

11:32.210 --> 11:36.415
Fourteen, yes, important humanistic

11:39.685 --> 11:40.967
and monastic libraries.

11:45.795 --> 11:46.696
3,600.

11:46.756 --> 11:50.462
That's all the title now, right?

11:50.482 --> 11:50.623
Mm-hmm.

11:51.624 --> 11:52.426
Title and subtitle.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.649
Where does the subtitle begin?

11:56.412 --> 12:00.999
The libraries from the... No, I mean, it's title and subtitle, the title altogether.

12:03.183 --> 12:03.263
Wow.

12:03.648 --> 12:06.050
And what are some of the libraries, the Fourteen?

12:06.371 --> 12:09.534
The Fourteen, now, is the Burkina Library in Oxford.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.355
Yes.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.859
It's the work from the Edge of August in Wolfgang Battle.

12:14.499 --> 12:16.041
Yeah, that's the only one I haven't been to.

12:16.061 --> 12:16.561
Yeah.

12:16.581 --> 12:18.704
It's the Humanistic Library in Celestat.

12:20.886 --> 12:21.026
Uh-huh.

12:21.046 --> 12:23.969
It's the Strachof Monastery in Prague.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.133
It's the Matthias Corvinus in Budapest.

12:28.153 --> 12:30.456
It doesn't exist, but as a collection.

12:30.536 --> 12:31.697
That's a very important test.

12:31.846 --> 12:53.277
It's the beginning of the National Library of France during its period while it came in the National Library, I mean from the beginning up to Francis I. It's the same attitude towards the Austrian Library from the beginning up to the Maximilian II.

12:56.061 --> 12:59.085
It's the Patmos Library.

12:59.892 --> 13:04.938
It's the library in Panhard, in Kostaknopoul.

13:09.084 --> 13:09.184
Okay.

13:09.204 --> 13:10.766
And, uh, where are we?

13:11.327 --> 13:13.810
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

13:14.050 --> 13:14.491
Five more.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.633
Five more?

13:16.653 --> 13:17.034
That's fine.

13:17.274 --> 13:20.298
I just kept... I've got one.

13:21.019 --> 13:22.180
That's fine.

13:22.321 --> 13:23.122
The library in St.

13:23.142 --> 13:23.843
Gallen.

13:23.863 --> 13:25.084
I've been there, yes.

13:25.104 --> 13:25.204
St.

13:25.284 --> 13:27.507
Gallen.

13:27.527 --> 13:28.528
The Cesena Library.

13:28.549 --> 13:29.730
Cesena, then there.

13:30.065 --> 13:41.712
I'll bring you a coffee just to see you.

13:46.568 --> 13:54.556
They were the end sheets of your book and libraries, and this was a plan for a national library in France, which was never realized.

13:54.576 --> 13:56.558
But I'd like to see this more than the one they've got now.

13:56.578 --> 13:57.519
Yeah, yeah.

13:57.579 --> 13:58.500
Have you been to the new one?

13:58.560 --> 13:58.760
Yes.

13:58.940 --> 13:59.821
I have, too, yes.

14:00.081 --> 14:03.845
Even in France, I think you would like to see that before France.

14:03.885 --> 14:04.946
It's Mika.

14:04.966 --> 14:07.048
What are you going to do?

14:07.068 --> 14:07.929
This is wonderful.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.911
I assume it's illustrated, right?

14:11.333 --> 14:11.973
Oh, yeah.

14:12.013 --> 14:13.955
Magnificence.

14:13.975 --> 14:14.736
Let's see.

14:16.032 --> 14:18.095
Yeah, you know who would be a good publisher for this?

14:18.676 --> 14:20.238
Is Abrams or Yale.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.803
Yale, we might be in contact.

14:23.824 --> 14:24.645
Yale is excellent.

14:24.725 --> 14:25.907
I know people there.

14:25.927 --> 14:33.117
If you know them and want to call them, I'll let you know with whom I'm dealing with, Mr. Nichol.

14:33.137 --> 14:36.342
I know a woman there named, they wanted to publish my book.

14:37.364 --> 14:39.967
I know the book that you have downstairs.

14:40.007 --> 14:41.770
I wanted to go with a commercial publisher.

14:42.290 --> 14:45.033
because I wanted to sell it.

14:45.053 --> 14:45.713
Of course.

14:45.773 --> 14:46.554
But Yale does.

14:46.734 --> 14:47.895
Magnificent.

14:47.915 --> 14:49.857
I don't know if you've seen any of their art books.

14:50.117 --> 14:50.558
Beautiful.

14:50.758 --> 14:51.279
Really nice.

14:51.699 --> 14:54.642
They would be great for this.

14:55.803 --> 14:57.104
You're talking with someone at Yale?

14:57.745 --> 14:58.445
Already, yes.

14:58.746 --> 15:00.928
I'm just going to write them.

15:02.349 --> 15:04.771
Let me, and who's the person you're talking to?

15:04.791 --> 15:06.113
Mr. Nichol.

15:07.694 --> 15:08.295
Mr. Nichol?

15:08.575 --> 15:09.096
Nichol, yes.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.116
N-I-C-H-O-L?

15:10.437 --> 15:10.677
Yes.

15:11.585 --> 15:17.612
So I'll tell Sarah that you're already talking with Mr. Nickel, and I will just give this.

15:17.752 --> 15:19.915
They know me.

15:20.275 --> 15:21.797
I write about their books every year.

15:21.817 --> 15:23.519
Right now I'm doing their books for Christmas.

15:26.042 --> 15:29.867
I can't promise anything, but I can promise it's my best shot, as we say.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.530
And I think it would be good for Yale.

15:32.911 --> 15:37.356
It's Abrams, you've heard of Abrams, but they've recently, but we don't have to record this.

15:38.956 --> 15:42.221
The evil, the West, Byzantine, and the Renaissance.

15:42.241 --> 15:47.390
And you can get everything that... Did you get all of the illustrations yourself?

15:48.031 --> 15:48.873
Yes, you did all this.

15:49.133 --> 15:51.056
And we made this for the pagination with notes.

15:51.517 --> 15:52.619
Wow.

15:53.801 --> 15:57.166
And you're having this... This is already fully translated now as we speak.

15:57.186 --> 15:58.468
Yes.

15:58.489 --> 15:59.751
And you're publishing this.

15:59.811 --> 16:01.093
This will be available this fall.

16:02.275 --> 16:03.597
I would like to purchase a copy.

16:03.914 --> 16:06.557
Yes, I think it's available, okay?

16:06.577 --> 16:09.760
As soon as it's available, in fact, I would like to use it.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.441
It's beautiful.

16:12.963 --> 16:15.225
I made it from scratch.

16:15.245 --> 16:17.367
You had your own photographers, that's Chezaina?

16:17.387 --> 16:18.648
Yes, my own photographers, yes.

16:18.668 --> 16:25.655
We went all around all these libraries with this special, unique photograph of it.

16:26.416 --> 16:30.900
And there are all kinds of ingredients that exist, which are in my personal collection.

16:31.285 --> 16:43.160
people and aspects of the library's house, Colin Oversarion, and... Do you write about Colin Oversarion in here too?

16:43.220 --> 16:43.580
Yes.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.202
There is a huge article.

16:45.222 --> 16:47.024
It's kind of the San Marcos library.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.308
This is beautiful.

16:55.094 --> 16:56.796
This is exquisite.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.259
Congratulations.

16:59.279 --> 16:59.740
Thank you.

17:00.192 --> 17:03.897
What accounts for your interest, your passion?

17:04.117 --> 17:09.063
Obviously, do you have an explanation for your passion for books and for the library?

17:09.083 --> 17:10.625
You asked me the question.

17:10.685 --> 17:15.972
Metathetically, if you want to search with the idea.

17:16.432 --> 17:20.637
Well, it's like my second nature.

17:21.799 --> 17:22.179
I don't know.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.143
I mean, are you trained as a scholar?

17:25.183 --> 17:26.024
No, not at all.

17:26.465 --> 17:27.566
What's your background?

17:27.586 --> 17:29.929
Interior designer, interior architect.

17:30.938 --> 17:33.722
And so this is your profession, in other words.

17:33.742 --> 17:34.163
Yes.

17:34.183 --> 17:39.851
So professionally you're an interior architect, which obviously supports these other activities.

17:41.413 --> 17:43.376
So are you a collector as well?

17:44.557 --> 17:45.839
I mean, I can see this on the wall.

17:45.859 --> 17:53.169
Yes, I have a huge collection of the books printed for the Greeks of the diaspora, something like 4,000 editions.

17:53.189 --> 17:53.410
Wow.

17:53.730 --> 17:58.617
From the Renaissance period up to the beginning of 1900.

17:59.103 --> 18:02.287
And what occasioned your interest in the diaspora?

18:02.888 --> 18:07.093
Well, you know, there were special books printed for the Greeks.

18:09.696 --> 18:11.619
For many reasons, liturgical.

18:11.639 --> 18:23.654
These are all liturgical, as you see, all Mimea, Gospels, histories, any kind of book was printed for the Greeks.

18:23.674 --> 18:28.300
From the Renaissance period, where we had a completely different interest, as we had

18:28.482 --> 18:35.051
grammars and dictionaries and humanistic subjects.

18:35.552 --> 18:45.486
Then we turn to the interests of the Greeks of the diaspora, which were mainly the liturgical book and some histories.

18:45.726 --> 18:55.620
And then with the Enlightenment period, we have a new, let's say, publishing activity towards the Enlightenment ideas

18:55.904 --> 19:03.435
around democracy, around the re-evaluation of the classics, and around the new literature, poetry, and all that.

19:03.996 --> 19:09.784
So all that, with the people that are involved, covers my interests, plus the libraries.

19:09.824 --> 19:15.853
So when you talk about designing the libraries, you are actually designing them as a...

19:15.935 --> 19:42.837
as a professional professional yes yes and so and what's your focus what you what are you trying to do as a designer when you're designing an ancient library let me also say this is very fortuitous i i've already interviewed for this new book you definitely have a place in this new book by the way uh there's a fellow in boston for a major major architectural firm that does all the modern libraries for all the major colleges and universities well these are my plans for the library from the

19:43.103 --> 19:44.425
Humanity library.

19:44.445 --> 19:44.705
Yes.

19:44.806 --> 19:48.491
This was the original plan in two levels then was the actual plan.

19:48.832 --> 19:50.274
Then this is the Patmos library.

19:50.454 --> 19:52.517
Patmos didn't have a library.

19:52.738 --> 20:01.812
It had a beautiful collection but in a room like that with different cupboards where the manuscripts were kept.

20:01.832 --> 20:02.513
And it was all.

20:02.653 --> 20:03.614
And so when was this done?

20:05.097 --> 20:07.801
It was finished in 1989.

20:07.821 --> 20:09.263
1989.

20:09.648 --> 20:35.799
So when you approach something like this... Well, I have to take under consideration the general architectural structure and tradition, the location, the collection, the special, let's say... Well, the problem with the Byzantine libraries is it's more, let's say, complicated because there didn't exist any libraries up to now, monastic libraries, to see how they were organized.

20:36.339 --> 20:39.503
The collections in the monastery were in the same...

20:39.652 --> 20:40.653
Let's say, philosophy.

20:41.033 --> 20:47.480
A room without... It wasn't a completely medieval, let's say, fold.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.722
Well, let me give you an example.

20:48.742 --> 20:50.243
At Vardopedi, for instance.

20:50.263 --> 20:51.184
Yes.

20:51.204 --> 20:54.268
Those books were scattered all over the monastery and the skettis.

20:54.448 --> 20:57.711
So finally, they brought them together and they put them in a tower.

20:57.731 --> 20:58.953
Four floors.

20:59.313 --> 21:03.938
Over at Iveron, they took the old bakery.

21:04.407 --> 21:05.989
and they put in shelves.

21:06.149 --> 21:21.249
So clearly... I have a special article about the abolition of the library in the Byzantine world, from the tradition, the Roman tradition that came in Byzantine with the first emperors.

21:21.769 --> 21:31.782
And it's very, very interesting to see how many aspects about the policy of the books were alive

21:32.133 --> 21:34.756
in different levels through the business time period.

21:35.677 --> 21:37.019
Is this a challenge for you?

21:37.319 --> 21:42.585
Is this something that you are hired to do, or is this something that you go out and offer your services?

21:42.685 --> 21:43.186
I'm curious.

21:44.307 --> 21:51.815
How does one get to design ancient libraries, modern facilities for ancient collections, you always say?

21:51.835 --> 21:52.516
How does that happen?

21:53.557 --> 21:57.702
Easily.

22:02.086 --> 22:03.148
beautiful to describe it.

22:03.308 --> 22:07.214
Yes, but these people come to you because they know that... Yes, yes.

22:07.554 --> 22:13.283
I mean, Vatopendi also asked me to make... to reorganize... Are you working in the museum up there?

22:13.303 --> 22:13.504
No.

22:14.225 --> 22:14.946
There is a museum.

22:14.966 --> 22:15.487
Yes, I know.

22:15.507 --> 22:18.351
They asked me to do the museum, but I didn't have time.

22:18.511 --> 22:25.562
My works take a lot of time and a lot of thinking, and I do not want to make things just for, you know,

22:27.820 --> 22:29.462
What is your normal work?

22:30.663 --> 22:32.085
What kind of work normally do you do?

22:32.185 --> 22:33.026
How do you make your living?

22:33.527 --> 22:34.027
India design.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.550
But can you give me some examples of the kinds of things you do?

22:36.871 --> 22:42.037
I have some special, let's say, clients, and I'm doing for them special things.

22:42.137 --> 22:43.438
Like homes, businesses?

22:43.458 --> 22:45.020
Like homes, churches.

22:45.581 --> 22:46.101
Offices.

22:46.141 --> 22:48.705
Offices, libraries, private.

22:48.725 --> 22:57.675
But things that take me, private, let's say, company, strategical buildings for them.

22:59.647 --> 23:01.889
Primarily in Greece or internationally?

23:02.149 --> 23:04.291
Primarily in Greece, yes.

23:04.311 --> 23:05.633
And how long have you been doing this?

23:07.254 --> 23:08.395
Quite a long time.

23:08.455 --> 23:09.216
And this will be?

23:09.556 --> 23:10.978
Over 70, I guess.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.800
And this will be in the CV that you send me?

23:12.820 --> 23:13.400
Yes, I will.

23:13.420 --> 23:13.560
Good.

23:13.580 --> 23:14.962
So we won't bother with that.

23:15.182 --> 23:19.766
So at what point did your passion for books become inflamed?

23:19.786 --> 23:25.412
Well, in the beginning, I had the sort of... I just want to make sure.

23:25.432 --> 23:26.953
We always check how we're doing.

23:27.203 --> 23:39.996
It's a collection of things, plus books, around the general interest, let's say, about Greece and Greek civilization.

23:40.016 --> 23:53.109
And then, I must say, I've seen one of the first books printed by the Greeks, by a special man called Zacharias Kalieris, who worked in the 15th century.

23:53.230 --> 23:56.253
Can I take a few pictures every time?

23:56.273 --> 23:56.653
No, no, check it.

23:56.903 --> 24:07.376
I've seen also some of the printer marks of old and very valuable Greek editions.

24:08.618 --> 24:23.417
And I started having an interest in this huge publication of the Greeks that covers these four centuries.

24:24.342 --> 24:27.325
has to do with something like 7,000 editions.

24:28.586 --> 24:34.391
And at the same time, from the Patmos library they came and asked me to build the library.

24:35.132 --> 24:53.269
So this special interest, collecting books, printed by the Greeks, for the Greeks, plus organizing a so important library as the library of Osius and Patmos is.

24:55.240 --> 25:11.395
which in fact is the oldest library in the world that we know that has to do... I will give you a copy.

25:11.575 --> 25:18.981
So you can photograph it as much as you want.

25:19.001 --> 25:25.247
I was saying that the Patmos Library is the oldest library in the world, that we have a direct

25:25.548 --> 25:42.548
connection of the personal library of the man in the first century, and with the history, the continuous history, in the same location, up to date.

25:42.568 --> 25:43.710
It's very important.

25:45.031 --> 25:50.698
And how did you, did you know this, or was it something you learned in your, in your travel?

25:50.838 --> 25:52.500
In searching, yes, of course.

25:53.003 --> 26:05.694
But here came the opportunity to design this library knowing that I have this, let's say, knowing that I know about books and possibly I would be interested in making a library.

26:06.334 --> 26:09.177
And then my interest started from there.

26:09.197 --> 26:19.886
So I have these parallel lives, the book and the library, which are things very, very much in common.

26:19.906 --> 26:22.268
So that's that.

26:22.568 --> 26:28.334
But have you always had a lot of books, even from being a small child?

26:28.354 --> 26:29.094
No, not really.

26:29.915 --> 26:30.316
Not really.

26:33.198 --> 26:33.559
Not really.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.261
Would you describe yourself as a reader?

26:40.726 --> 26:41.967
Not a classical reader.

26:43.308 --> 26:50.095
I'm always involved in reading things that are the support for creation.

26:50.581 --> 26:58.655
for a recreation of the book, or of this book that's... These books up here, are these books that you're familiar with?

26:59.176 --> 26:59.256
Yes.

27:00.558 --> 27:00.718
Yes.

27:00.738 --> 27:08.251
All these are editions from Venice and Vienna, a Greek book for the Greeks.

27:08.271 --> 27:15.964
I think, is there a... I'm sure I will get this out of this book, but is the book culture of Greece

27:16.957 --> 27:18.138
a great book culture.

27:18.619 --> 27:19.700
How would you... Today?

27:20.601 --> 27:21.201
Yes, today.

27:22.743 --> 27:25.265
Well... You smile, by the way.

27:25.285 --> 27:27.227
The state recorder doesn't pick up smiles.

27:27.387 --> 27:27.748
Yes.

27:29.349 --> 27:37.618
It's more important to see the history of the Greeks during the centuries.

27:37.638 --> 27:46.947
Greeks have been writing, publishing, and editing from the 6th century BC up to now continuously.

27:47.483 --> 27:53.110
They have, let's say, inaugurated libraries in the Western world.

27:54.051 --> 28:06.345
They have created the market of the book, and the circulation of the book, and with Aristotle, also the conscience of the importance of a private library.

28:07.547 --> 28:17.338
So, during the black period of the Greeks under the Osman Empire, they never stopped printing and editing.

28:17.605 --> 28:18.226
I'm sorry.

28:18.246 --> 28:19.167
Yes.

28:19.727 --> 28:26.875
One of the things I was told up at Vagopedi, for instance, is that they said that during the Ottoman period they were denied the press.

28:27.635 --> 28:36.364
Yes, but that was a very fortunate thing for the Greeks, because they denied the press because it was against the Korani.

28:36.384 --> 28:41.049
Even the Turks didn't get these books until 1765.

28:41.069 --> 28:46.735
But on the other hand, the left completely liberated the circulation of the

28:46.985 --> 29:15.996
in the commercial aspect of the books I mean books were circulating in all the places of the Ottoman Empire freely and that also was a very fruitful thing for the Greeks because they had only one or two centers of printing centers and it was very easy to have a whole market

29:16.263 --> 29:24.074
towards all these colonies like Alexandria, most of the troops.

29:25.456 --> 29:45.966
Because otherwise painting presses in places where nobody was able to cover the necessary number of books that you have to circulate so the company can be alive.

29:46.199 --> 29:54.151
That made the various, let's say, Greek printing presses to be fruitful for four centuries at least.

29:54.171 --> 30:12.578
So, of course, we didn't forbidden the printing in the areas that were under the Ottoman control, except of two places at the beginning of the 17th century,

30:12.794 --> 30:18.800
which had a very special political system.

30:19.781 --> 30:28.210
It was Iasi and Bucharest, the Parisitias duchesses, the Hegemonias.

30:29.631 --> 30:40.843
There Greeks, Phanariotes, were sort of princes, and they had the right, according to a special treaty between the Austrians and the Turks,

30:41.296 --> 30:42.818
to paint books as well.

30:43.159 --> 30:46.384
Now you can see some of them, just to give an idea.

30:51.833 --> 31:02.269
These are books.

31:02.570 --> 31:07.017
These are the coat of arms.

31:10.338 --> 31:22.189
Look at that.

31:22.209 --> 31:23.691
What's the day, what's the year on these?

31:24.972 --> 31:26.173
Are these incunables?

31:26.193 --> 31:26.714
No, no.

31:26.774 --> 31:28.556
They're 17th century.

31:30.317 --> 31:31.899
These look like original bindings, though.

31:32.019 --> 31:32.579
Yes, they are.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.501
They all are.

31:34.521 --> 31:35.662
Where do you find these?

31:35.682 --> 31:37.324
Look at the annotations.

31:37.675 --> 31:39.598
Find these through dealers or...?

31:39.618 --> 31:53.758
Well, all over the world, but not very... Very often how the books like that come from the market.

31:53.878 --> 31:54.739
Are there pictures here?

31:54.839 --> 31:56.041
Yes, just where we are.

31:56.061 --> 31:59.626
It's so wonderful in Kansas.

31:59.706 --> 32:02.670
I mean, there's an impact where there's ice land.

32:14.075 --> 32:15.817
We'll take some more.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.282
You don't mind my working like this.

32:19.382 --> 32:22.045
No, no, no, no.

32:23.147 --> 32:23.808
Okay.

32:23.828 --> 32:24.629
Your first name is?

32:25.950 --> 32:26.691
Nicholas.

32:26.711 --> 32:27.032
Nicholas.

32:28.233 --> 32:38.286
I keep in my glasses because I've lost my glasses too hard.

32:38.827 --> 32:41.871
I'm

32:42.577 --> 32:44.119
I'm sorry, we're jumping around here.

32:45.801 --> 32:53.611
Under the Turks, the Greeks could save their culture, under 500 years of Turkish domination.

32:54.492 --> 32:56.174
Do you think books had anything to do with that?

32:56.495 --> 32:58.037
A lot.

32:58.057 --> 32:59.599
Basically.

32:59.619 --> 33:07.349
Because the actual liturgical books were not only for the needs of the Church.

33:07.369 --> 33:10.052
Many of them as the Psalterian and other

33:10.336 --> 33:20.088
elementary books, was served as elementary grammars and tools for the Greeks to learn Greek.

33:20.729 --> 33:27.517
But through the books also, and through the ritual of the Orthodox Church, they kept alive continuously the Greek language.

33:28.438 --> 33:36.748
And of course, you have to consider that except many places, especially Greece and the south of Greece,

33:37.049 --> 33:41.715
where they really were very poor in many, many, many terms.

33:42.236 --> 33:50.687
The Greeks of the diaspora and some of them were very, very important people in different capitals of the Mediterranean world in general.

33:51.328 --> 33:56.715
From the end of the 17th century, we have them in St.

33:56.755 --> 33:58.657
Petersburg and in Moscow.

33:58.677 --> 34:03.023
We have them in Alexandria through

34:03.172 --> 34:04.694
since the 4th century.

34:04.714 --> 34:06.296
We have Smyrna.

34:06.316 --> 34:11.742
We have them in Odisov, which was the main port of the Russians.

34:12.263 --> 34:25.278
From the end of the 17th century, we have them in two more or less free countries, which is the Moldovlasia, and Moldovlasia.

34:25.439 --> 34:28.823
We have them in Vienna, from the beginning of the 18th century.

34:28.843 --> 34:30.765
We have them in Paris,

34:31.117 --> 34:53.560
in Marseille, and of course, in main capital cities in Italy, especially in Venice, from the end of the 15th century up to now, and for several periods in Rome and in Florence.

34:53.780 --> 34:58.525
And then from the 17th century, end of 17th century, in Livorno, a great

34:58.977 --> 35:08.125
And Trieste, two great colonies with Greeks, counting some 60 or 100,000 people, more or less.

35:09.807 --> 35:21.417
So all these places where the Greeks were free, they were in communication with one another through the books.

35:21.437 --> 35:22.718
They never stopped printing.

35:23.419 --> 35:28.343
The first books, of course, you read here, and the Greek were

35:28.627 --> 35:45.870
painted for special humanistic reasons, but not after a decade, from when the first book, Greek text, was published, which is 1469, 1470, something.

35:46.952 --> 35:56.625
Then the Greek books for the Greeks started being printed in Italy, and they never stopped.

35:56.977 --> 35:59.160
You've written nine, ten books.

36:00.402 --> 36:01.904
Yes, more or less.

36:01.924 --> 36:04.067
And where do you find the time to do this?

36:04.748 --> 36:06.911
And do you consider yourself a scholar?

36:09.835 --> 36:14.482
Well, would you consider me a scholar?

36:15.764 --> 36:17.506
Yes, I would, actually.

36:17.526 --> 36:17.827
I would.

36:18.488 --> 36:21.011
Harvard University seems to think a great deal about your books.

36:21.152 --> 36:21.873
They have them all.

36:23.034 --> 36:26.359
I mean, I could call them on the telephone right now on the computer.

36:26.862 --> 36:38.013
and punch up your name, and they will give nine titles, which they consider important enough to have on call there for their students.

36:38.033 --> 36:39.815
How do you decide what to write about?

36:40.356 --> 36:48.464
Well, one thing brings another.

36:50.566 --> 36:56.532
Of course, I have in preparation three volumes of that size, one for each century.

36:56.815 --> 37:21.307
16th, 17th, 18th century, which we covered the whole, let's say, people that were involved in publication and books, which means that all the spiritual activity were centered in publication houses and printing houses.

37:21.327 --> 37:26.333
Then I'm thinking of making a very easy and more

37:26.937 --> 37:49.705
let's say, a book about the history of the libraries, not that kind of volume, not a paperback exactly, but something more affordable, yes, in four volumes or three volumes, just to give an idea how the evolution and the contribution of the Greeks

37:50.056 --> 37:52.019
to the idea of the library.

37:52.039 --> 37:54.682
When you write about the library, do you write about it as a physical structure?

37:54.702 --> 37:56.605
Do you write about it in terms of its content?

37:56.665 --> 38:07.079
No, I'm writing content, architectural-wise, and as a thesmosis, as an actual aspect of the civilization.

38:07.099 --> 38:08.941
And that word again, thesmosis?

38:08.961 --> 38:09.462
Thesmos.

38:09.742 --> 38:10.143
Thesmosis.

38:10.163 --> 38:13.187
Thesmosis, which is something that is like a law.

38:15.310 --> 38:15.710
Thesmosis.

38:15.791 --> 38:17.353
That would make a great chapter.

38:17.373 --> 38:19.135
Yes.

38:19.874 --> 38:22.999
I'll have my friend Nick Gage translate that for me.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.143
How does that translate, would you say?

38:26.203 --> 38:40.784
Thesmos, it's something that civilization gives a very great importance of Thesmos to Hamo.

38:40.965 --> 38:48.075
The marriage is more or less, the way of marrying, it's like the ethy.

38:48.308 --> 38:53.093
the way of living and behaving.

38:54.455 --> 39:04.806
So it was something like a conscience that every man, every ruler in his own city should have a library.

39:05.327 --> 39:06.308
It's a task.

39:06.468 --> 39:07.309
It's a master.

39:08.250 --> 39:12.935
It was a measure of your success, like we talk about Chezzena, which you have.

39:12.955 --> 39:13.035
Yes.

39:13.536 --> 39:14.677
That's a perfect example.

39:14.697 --> 39:17.320
That's the oldest library in the world, I guess,

39:17.671 --> 39:21.555
It's even older than the Lorenziana in its original setting.

39:21.575 --> 39:22.396
Setting.

39:22.416 --> 39:24.819
The only library that has all its tools there.

39:24.839 --> 39:25.279
All its fittings.

39:25.419 --> 39:26.280
All its fittings there.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.423
All its fittings, its tools, the books are still clean.

39:28.443 --> 39:28.883
Perfect, yes.

39:29.143 --> 39:29.864
The only library.

39:30.044 --> 39:34.109
And, you know, when I sat down there, as I assure you did, the windows are perfect.

39:34.649 --> 39:36.351
You sit down, the light comes in.

39:36.571 --> 39:37.733
Yes, yes, absolutely.

39:37.753 --> 39:41.096
And it's designed for reading.

39:41.436 --> 39:44.820
Do you take this into account when you're redesigning a library?

39:45.361 --> 39:47.163
Are you designing it with readers in mind?

39:47.363 --> 39:47.543
Yes.

39:47.945 --> 39:48.786
Absolutely.

39:48.806 --> 39:53.751
Because most of these places that you've done, I think, are more repositories than they are.

39:53.771 --> 39:54.532
Readings as well.

39:55.813 --> 39:55.994
Readings.

39:56.034 --> 40:01.059
So do you think about, as the ancients did, where we're going to put the windows for the light?

40:01.259 --> 40:01.760
Absolutely.

40:02.701 --> 40:07.165
Tell me, for instance, what you had to do, what the special problems were at Patmos.

40:07.186 --> 40:10.749
In Patmos, it was under the earth, the library.

40:11.570 --> 40:16.095
So even so, I had...

40:16.379 --> 40:21.806
and find a small hole just to bring light in there.

40:22.327 --> 40:30.558
But not for reading, but just to give the geographical position of the library.

40:31.439 --> 40:33.441
Of course, light is not the best print of the books.

40:33.902 --> 40:35.063
It's the worst.

40:35.084 --> 40:42.353
And also for the ancient libraries, it was the worst also for humidity problems and other kinds of...

40:43.784 --> 40:49.091
that field, rain coming in with the wind and things like that.

40:49.111 --> 41:10.500
That's why in the Ashton libraries were all around with, let's say, had archaic all around for that special reason, to protect the windows from the wind and from the

41:10.919 --> 41:14.664
humidity and from the rain coming in.

41:14.684 --> 41:17.667
What kind of special pleasure do you take in creating a library?

41:17.687 --> 41:20.511
Ah, great pleasure.

41:20.531 --> 41:20.972
Great.

41:20.992 --> 41:28.741
And again, when you, and name, I know we have it on the tape, but could you just tick off the libraries that you've done for me?

41:29.522 --> 41:33.808
List of the, tell me the libraries that you have designed for which facility.

41:33.868 --> 41:34.629
Is this Patmos?

41:34.649 --> 41:38.073
Patmos, and the, and the one in the Fanard.

41:38.734 --> 41:39.795
The Fanard is?

41:40.113 --> 41:51.489
Fanar is in Constantinople, the oldest library of the Christian world.

41:52.070 --> 42:03.927
Its origin goes back to Constantin the Great, when he had inaugurated Constantinople as his capital of the Eastern Empire.

42:04.598 --> 42:33.458
and from that period we know that he had ordered in Cesaria where there was a special scriptorium there 50 Bibles to cover the necessities of the first church that were in construction in Constantinople and also for the center for the Patriarch Hill which was the head of the

42:33.944 --> 42:43.775
the churches, and from that period we know that there was an actual policy of a library in the Patriarch.

42:45.817 --> 42:47.078
Are the original books still there?

42:48.159 --> 42:51.683
The oldest one is from the 9th century.

42:51.743 --> 42:53.625
So they do have some of the old ones.

42:53.645 --> 42:54.626
Yes.

42:56.448 --> 42:59.692
How does their collection compare to some of the other collections?

43:00.292 --> 43:02.955
Well, they do have 500 manuscripts.

43:04.167 --> 43:14.718
It's not bad, and at least 20,000 books and important libraries of medical figures that are donated after the death.

43:14.738 --> 43:22.126
The library is there as Athenagoras of 40 years, and are the great leaders of the orthodoxy.

43:22.146 --> 43:32.217
And that tells you just how great something like Pao Apos is, when Vardopedi has 2,050, and Ediron has another 2,000, and Lava has more than 4,000.

43:32.433 --> 43:33.995
It's amazing what it is.

43:34.015 --> 43:35.416
Have you been to Athos?

43:35.436 --> 43:37.258
Yes, several times.

43:37.918 --> 43:42.423
Do you have a comment on the importance of Athos in the preservation of Greek culture?

43:43.905 --> 43:46.447
Well, great.

43:46.767 --> 43:47.348
I mean, the great.

43:48.009 --> 43:48.349
The great.

43:49.390 --> 44:00.381
So the policy about the books were many times, let's say, doubtless.

44:00.817 --> 44:17.373
as an important cosmic library, because for several years there were many entities towards the ownership by the monks of material things.

44:17.853 --> 44:22.758
So sometimes even an extremely valuable book for them didn't... Had no meaning.

44:22.958 --> 44:28.123
Had no meaning, because it had to do like being an anchor

44:28.525 --> 44:36.255
to the world, though they were anxious to send the spirit towards God.

44:36.395 --> 44:46.889
So there were many things towards this philosophy, or the philosophy of Physicastes and Palamas and other movements.

44:47.369 --> 44:55.039
So the policy around books and libraries is very contradictory for many periods with Mount Athos.

44:55.998 --> 44:56.859
But they saved them.

44:57.099 --> 44:58.000
They saved them a lot.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.802
For the most part, our culture is there.

44:59.822 --> 45:00.002
Yes, yes.

45:00.303 --> 45:06.069
Now, this has nothing to do with the books, but it has everything to do with the story of Britain for Smithsonian, which is about Athos.

45:07.470 --> 45:11.795
What does Athos mean to Greek men in general and Greek men today?

45:11.835 --> 45:14.257
Is going to Athos a lot like going to Mecca?

45:14.277 --> 45:18.222
I mean, every young man I touch with, you ask, is it?

45:18.242 --> 45:24.368
I don't think it has so much to do with the original thing.

45:24.837 --> 45:38.116
as something completely virgin, as a way of behaving, living, and... Probably I'm not the right man to ask that kind of thing.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.338
No, I think you are, because you're a civilian.

45:39.378 --> 45:45.106
I want to know what, because there were so many Greeks up there I couldn't talk with, and I wanted to know why they were there.

45:46.609 --> 45:48.972
Some of them looked like they'd gone up for four days of...

45:49.458 --> 45:57.345
of getting away, and walking, and exercise, and prayer.

46:01.749 --> 46:04.872
I lost ten pounds, and I'd like to lose potentially more.

46:06.473 --> 46:09.416
But it seems to me to be a very therapeutic kind of a place.

46:09.436 --> 46:10.117
Yes, as well.

46:10.517 --> 46:11.678
As well.

46:11.698 --> 46:14.801
And I'm going to start this story with Fr.

46:14.821 --> 46:17.203
Benny, because they're all young.

46:17.403 --> 46:17.844
Exactly.

46:17.884 --> 46:19.526
The abbot is 44 years old.

46:19.966 --> 46:21.088
They're putting in a museum.

46:21.128 --> 46:23.310
They're going to do an international exhibition.

46:23.330 --> 46:28.957
They do these tours in English, and they're putting in a new building for guests.

46:29.077 --> 46:32.261
They have toilets that you can sit in, which is what they have to shower.

46:32.502 --> 46:34.845
You know, that's public relations.

46:34.865 --> 46:37.828
That's not all prayer, and this is a mind.

46:38.369 --> 46:39.951
Yes, they're opening a little bit.

46:39.971 --> 46:40.632
They're opening.

46:40.792 --> 46:43.275
And it is a new brotherhood, which...

46:43.576 --> 46:48.502
And I think the Smithsonian wants me to write about this monastic republic.

46:48.522 --> 46:50.805
Is it going into the Middle Ages?

46:51.746 --> 46:55.611
Yes and no, is my answer.

46:55.631 --> 47:00.477
You know, they drive around in four-wheel drives, and they smile a lot.

47:00.497 --> 47:02.359
They built the same thing, yes.

47:02.860 --> 47:05.963
But you go to Lava, they're all old over there.

47:05.983 --> 47:06.604
Very interesting.

47:06.664 --> 47:09.247
Anyway, your comment was very good.

47:09.267 --> 47:12.992
So you think it's kind of like a therapeutic...

47:13.681 --> 47:17.025
experience, not necessarily a spiritual one.

47:17.045 --> 47:17.886
Yes, I think so.

47:18.507 --> 47:20.189
Would that be a fair characterization?

47:20.209 --> 47:20.749
I think so, yes.

47:21.070 --> 47:22.211
And can I quote you on that?

47:22.271 --> 47:24.394
Yes, of course.

47:24.414 --> 47:26.096
And you've been, as you say, many times.

47:26.116 --> 47:26.256
Yes.

47:26.576 --> 47:28.439
And how do you feel when you go there, personally?

47:29.540 --> 47:38.330
Well, I always go very hunted, more or less, because I have a special interest just to see something.

47:38.350 --> 47:40.153
In business like me.

47:40.173 --> 47:41.354
Business class, yes.

47:41.374 --> 47:41.915
I was working.

47:41.955 --> 47:42.996
Book-wise, yes.

47:43.685 --> 47:51.332
As interesting as an experience as it was for me, I was working every minute.

47:51.352 --> 47:54.795
It's very, in a sense, that I was trying to put things together.

47:54.815 --> 48:13.371
It's very important also to see this monumental architecture in a field where there is nothing else but the church.

48:14.161 --> 48:23.152
And the environment, which is hopefully very, very well preserved and very authentic, I mean, in many ways.

48:23.752 --> 48:27.096
So it's something that you, it's extremely uncommon.

48:27.597 --> 48:29.840
To see something in situ like that.

48:29.860 --> 48:31.141
Yes, absolutely.

48:31.161 --> 48:37.108
I had that feeling at Yvonne, particularly, I had time just to walk.

48:37.349 --> 48:41.974
So I walked up the road towards GES, and going up the hill, going up the hill,

48:42.798 --> 48:57.554
You can see Athos over here, the monastery down here, the ocean, and the elements of the architecture just totally absorbed in the heart of the... Your question was very, let's say, on the spot.

48:57.574 --> 49:09.086
If you take out all the telephones and if you take out some cars and circulation and any kind of machinery, you're living in the medieval period.

49:09.467 --> 49:10.628
There's nothing changed.

49:12.093 --> 49:21.885
And then you really do, as a designer in particular, you must really have an appreciation for the original design and what was going on here.

49:22.666 --> 49:26.911
It's not like we have a little Byzantine church downtown that's surrounded by steps.

49:27.452 --> 49:28.814
So what do we see there, you know?

49:31.557 --> 49:33.960
I'm sorry to go off on the tangent right there.

49:34.220 --> 49:35.982
And tell me, by the way, when it's getting late.

49:36.002 --> 49:37.604
I don't know what your plans are.

49:37.764 --> 49:40.648
But we're covering a lot of ground.

49:40.966 --> 49:43.409
I am covering the areas that I want, so.

49:45.913 --> 49:46.553
Let me see.

49:46.674 --> 49:47.515
I have no questions.

49:47.535 --> 49:50.919
We're doing very good, by the way.

49:50.939 --> 49:56.567
We took book culture, and we talked about that.

49:56.587 --> 50:00.131
We talked about the Syrian libraries.

50:00.672 --> 50:02.294
You're going to give me your background, right?

50:03.256 --> 50:04.397
Yes.

50:04.517 --> 50:10.365
I think we're doing good.

50:10.497 --> 50:13.761
What would you like me to leave here with today?

50:13.801 --> 50:15.943
What would you like me to know about you?

50:16.664 --> 50:18.245
What's important for me to know about you?

50:22.250 --> 50:23.831
If we've met.

50:23.971 --> 50:24.552
I agree.

50:24.652 --> 50:27.575
I love it.

50:28.396 --> 50:33.822
You told me about the different things that you work on, homes, libraries.

50:34.527 --> 50:36.610
What is there special about doing it?

50:36.690 --> 50:39.133
Oh, you told me two of the libraries that you've done.

50:39.153 --> 50:40.474
Can you give me some of the others?

50:40.494 --> 50:42.416
I think that's very important.

50:42.437 --> 50:46.902
You said the one in Constantinople, the Patmos, the Fanad you did, the Patmos?

50:47.082 --> 50:47.643
Yes.

50:47.663 --> 50:49.545
I've made a very private library.

50:52.809 --> 50:52.949
Mm-hmm.

50:52.969 --> 50:54.371
I made several private libraries.

50:54.811 --> 50:56.974
But one of them I'll send you a photograph.

50:57.034 --> 50:57.815
I don't have any.

50:58.296 --> 51:02.020
It's for a Greek who has a lot to do with...

51:02.270 --> 51:05.354
with the states as well, Mr. Condominas.

51:06.055 --> 51:06.616
With a K?

51:06.876 --> 51:10.281
With a K. Dimitrios Condominas.

51:10.301 --> 51:11.102
Dimitrios?

51:11.122 --> 51:11.783
Condominas.

51:11.944 --> 51:12.564
K-O-N?

51:12.805 --> 51:18.433
K-O-N-D-O-M-E-N-A-S.

51:18.453 --> 51:21.577
K-O-N-D-O-M-E-N-A-S.

51:21.597 --> 51:22.398
Condominas.

51:22.458 --> 51:22.699
Yes.

51:23.239 --> 51:24.681
And he lives here in Athens?

51:24.782 --> 51:27.746
Yes, he's the president of the Inter-American Insurance Company.

51:28.507 --> 51:30.089
Inter-American.

51:30.109 --> 51:31.551
Inter-American Insurance.

51:32.527 --> 51:35.050
And is this for a personal collection, or is it for a library?

51:35.090 --> 51:35.991
Here's a personal collection.

51:36.171 --> 51:41.598
Here's a very beautiful historical, I would say, a private house.

51:42.359 --> 51:47.084
And I have designed, I've designed all the cars, but I've designed it in my library.

51:47.144 --> 51:48.706
I will send you some photographs.

51:49.447 --> 51:56.215
And here's a very important collection of travelers in Greece.

51:57.677 --> 52:00.120
Something like 1,000 volumes, more or less.

52:00.505 --> 52:01.526
Through history, of course.

52:01.546 --> 52:07.391
Through history, yes, and some very important classical editions.

52:07.411 --> 52:16.219
And I worked a lot in organizing the library and designing the library in the house.

52:16.799 --> 52:29.550
It's a small one, but it's very, very particular, because I have designed some Stucco, let's say, scenes with all the sciences and arts

52:29.969 --> 52:37.040
And they are all, in that context, completely neoclassical, Byzantine things.

52:37.060 --> 52:39.503
And what was the challenge for you in this particular library?

52:39.543 --> 52:41.306
What was the greatest challenge?

52:44.130 --> 52:46.634
Well, as always, just to create an atmosphere.

52:46.654 --> 52:48.737
I like the hands, that's what I'm saying.

52:48.757 --> 52:50.360
I like it when you're gesturing like that.

52:50.380 --> 52:57.310
To create an atmosphere which is suitable for the right person.

52:57.830 --> 53:03.356
This is also, I think, a challenge.

53:03.376 --> 53:06.680
I mean, the right thing for the right person.

53:07.621 --> 53:11.345
Some of the other institutional libraries besides Patmos?

53:15.950 --> 53:25.440
I have designed for a huge school a library which is

53:28.019 --> 53:33.025
a double library, a conventional library with books, and an electronic library.

53:33.686 --> 53:38.933
And that was a challenge also to combine these two different ways of learning.

53:39.994 --> 53:42.337
How do you feel about this, the electronic?

53:43.679 --> 53:50.728
Well, I'm not very keen about it, but I must say that it helps a lot in many fields.

53:51.049 --> 53:57.537
It cannot cover the... It helps a lot in the...

53:57.837 --> 54:02.244
in communicating things and in being in communication with other people.

54:03.225 --> 54:10.376
And I think that it will help also in special fields and special knowledge.

54:10.396 --> 54:16.645
I think that it will never overcome the conventional library.

54:17.887 --> 54:23.555
It will never make the conventional, the book, a museum piece.

54:24.196 --> 54:25.498
Never, I think.

54:25.782 --> 54:36.358
I have a chapter on books of the future in this new book that I'm writing, and technology and all the other stuff, and I totally agree.

54:36.578 --> 54:39.623
Certain things, research things.

54:39.823 --> 54:41.225
Journals, for instance.

54:41.406 --> 54:43.409
They're all electronic even now.

54:44.230 --> 54:46.674
Journals are electronic, and they deserve to be.

54:46.714 --> 54:49.458
Because a journal is published, and it's very expensive.

54:49.478 --> 54:50.980
Only very few people are going to read it.

54:51.382 --> 55:20.359
and uh it's it's outdated we have to consider one basic thing also the book started from its initial from the first line it started as an element of knowledge it helped the spread of knowledge but immediately it became a piece of art it has been immediately been

55:21.098 --> 55:48.152
been worked by monster painters micrographs and it still is i've got to get the 575 that's an important quote do you use your books in your work do they inspire you to do certain elements could you give me an example that doesn't have to be a title but how does a book help you come up with a solution to a problem

55:49.027 --> 55:49.968
to a situation.

55:49.988 --> 56:17.565
Well, I might, you know, the connection of the way of thinking, the connections and the way of taking an idea might come from a completely different... I'm thinking about a door, and I might see an initial painted on a Kalorindjian manuscript and see some dots where whips can become huge nails or

56:17.798 --> 56:20.762
pieces of different wood in a special door I'm thinking.

56:22.405 --> 56:24.147
Constantly saying, I can use that.

56:24.948 --> 56:26.831
That is something that I can use.

56:26.851 --> 56:27.432
Using that.

56:27.632 --> 56:28.073
And that.

56:28.193 --> 56:29.795
And that's what we call parallel thinking.

56:29.815 --> 56:30.175
Parallel thinking.

56:30.196 --> 56:32.639
And that's why you're an artist.

56:34.061 --> 56:35.443
I don't know what else.

56:35.743 --> 56:39.609
I think we've covered a great deal, and I don't want to take up too much of your time.

56:39.689 --> 56:41.131
It's a great pleasure meeting you.

56:41.151 --> 56:45.177
And this is going to be very heavy to carry, but it's worth it.

56:46.038 --> 56:46.118
Yes.

56:46.334 --> 56:58.610
And I will absolutely make sure that the... How do you find time to do these books when you're... to do the books that you write?

56:58.650 --> 57:04.117
I mean, do you spend more time working on the books than you do on your design?

57:04.697 --> 57:05.859
For some periods, yes.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.883
And you do all of the research yourself?

57:08.983 --> 57:10.465
Where do you do most... Absolutely.

57:10.545 --> 57:13.028
And where do you do most... Where do you do your research?

57:13.448 --> 57:15.531
I have an extremely important...

57:15.781 --> 57:43.695
library with reference books and periodicals something like six thousand your personal library so the material for your books basically comes from your own but of course i have to go to several special libraries or archaeological schools and things like that to find material but basic but i have a very basic library

57:43.861 --> 57:44.562
That's here?

57:44.582 --> 57:49.287
A lot of things, tools, all tools about the history of books as well.

57:50.067 --> 57:50.408
Great.

57:50.428 --> 57:54.732
Now is this your home as well as your... No, no, it's absolutely strictly your office.

57:55.213 --> 57:57.956
And this is called Te Stipos.

57:57.976 --> 57:58.997
Yes, yes.

57:59.017 --> 57:59.958
And the S.P.

58:00.018 --> 58:00.298
is what?

58:00.338 --> 58:01.319
Is that your... My father.

58:01.800 --> 58:02.460
Spiritism.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.042
Spiritism.

58:04.062 --> 58:05.964
So, do you mind my asking how old you are?

58:06.424 --> 58:07.826
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

58:07.846 --> 58:08.386
Fifty-five.

58:08.607 --> 58:10.449
My exact age.

58:10.469 --> 58:10.769
I'm fifty-five.

58:10.789 --> 58:11.870
Nineteen forty-three.

58:11.890 --> 58:12.771
What's your birth take?

58:13.392 --> 58:14.753
Twenty-four months.

58:14.833 --> 58:15.854
Twenty-five May.

58:15.954 --> 58:16.395
Okay.

58:16.995 --> 58:19.017
And where were you educated?

58:20.458 --> 58:20.939
In Paris.

58:21.099 --> 58:21.579
In Paris.

58:22.540 --> 58:23.561
And that was in design?

58:23.861 --> 58:25.102
In design, interior design.

58:25.122 --> 58:27.424
So this is something that you always planned to do?

58:27.444 --> 58:27.945
Yes, yes.

58:28.065 --> 58:29.566
My father is an architect in that.

58:30.507 --> 58:34.350
I just deviated from architecture to interior design.

58:34.370 --> 58:43.298
I went to the School of Fine Arts, and then specialized in interior design.

58:43.801 --> 58:46.827
And is your father still here in Athens as well?

58:46.847 --> 58:46.948
Yes.

58:47.348 --> 58:50.214
Is he in this building or elsewhere?

58:50.234 --> 58:50.294
No.

58:50.315 --> 58:51.016
Yeah.

58:51.036 --> 58:51.457
That's great.

58:51.717 --> 58:55.565
I'm going to leave you here.

58:55.766 --> 58:58.772
Actually, the...

59:00.170 --> 59:04.396
The surrounding of the actual door going into the St.

59:04.436 --> 59:05.017
Galileo.

59:05.057 --> 59:08.061
Where they have the statement, medicine for the soul.

59:08.201 --> 59:09.663
I saw this.

59:09.723 --> 59:11.365
And they wouldn't let me take a picture of it.

59:11.405 --> 59:12.146
So now I'll take it.

59:12.227 --> 59:13.629
You have it in the book.

59:13.649 --> 59:13.789
Okay.

59:13.809 --> 59:14.430
How did you get it?

59:14.450 --> 59:16.312
You must have gotten permission for that.

59:16.873 --> 59:20.939
Well, that was a good... I liked the way you were standing right there with your arm.

59:21.700 --> 59:23.342
That was nice.

59:25.084 --> 59:26.346
Among those books.

59:27.271 --> 59:54.568
I'll just take a couple.

59:54.588 --> 59:54.788
Like this.

59:54.808 --> 59:55.008
Like this.

59:55.028 --> 59:55.229
Like this.

59:55.249 --> 59:55.449
Like this.

59:55.469 --> 59:55.669
Like this.

59:55.689 --> 59:55.890
Like this.

59:55.910 --> 59:56.110
Like this.

59:56.130 --> 59:56.330
Like this.

59:56.350 --> 59:56.550
Like this.

59:56.570 --> 59:56.771
Like this.

59:56.791 --> 59:56.991
Like this.

59:57.612 --> 01:00:03.985
I must have shot about the whole world.

01:00:04.005 --> 01:00:04.990
Which means I've got to take this.
