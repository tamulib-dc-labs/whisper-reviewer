Music's what they will

05:24.605 --> 05:28.123
like this.

05:29.109 --> 05:29.772
Don't live in the musical.

06:39.935 --> 06:42.015
We're in the mood.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.105
Don't just stand there.

06:43.125 --> 06:43.448
Let's get to it.

07:16.081 --> 07:30.597
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.268

Give him a love, give him Oh yes I am

11:46.267 --> 11:53.763
of the world.

11:53.783 --> 12:00.117
Yeah, I can't hear the teacher, the booze won't call me at all.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.660
I don't see the bad boys trying to catch some play, cause I'm in this booze.

12:30.479 --> 12:35.343
You know, it's all in the bay.

12:35.363 --> 12:38.739
I'm gonna put that new black meaning on my charge anyway.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.342
Cause I love it, I'm smiling.

13:11.975 --> 13:14.323
Yeah.

14:11.088 --> 14:39.908
You're the blue boy.

14:39.929 --> 14:40.289
I love your smile.

14:40.309 --> 14:40.670
I love your smile.

14:40.690 --> 14:41.010
I really didn't.

14:41.952 --> 14:45.376
Kiss 101.

14:45.396 --> 14:58.473
Something's missing and I don't know why I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you.

14:58.553 --> 15:01.516
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of?

15:01.536 --> 15:04.500
I tell myself, I'll show you what I'm made of.

15:25.000 --> 15:37.282
In my heart, I know we've come apart And I don't know where to start What can I do?

15:37.302 --> 15:40.528
I don't wanna feel blue

15:43.057 --> 15:59.850
Kissing someone else's lips So too many cigarettes today I'm not happy when I act this way Bad girl drunk by six Kissing some kind of stranger's face

16:10.681 --> 16:14.968
Something's happened and I can't go back.

16:15.108 --> 16:24.062
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me.

16:24.082 --> 16:25.964
What happens now?

16:27.206 --> 16:29.470
I know I don't deserve you.

16:29.650 --> 16:32.434
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you.

16:32.454 --> 16:33.516
Can't be myself.

17:02.892 --> 17:28.090
I don't wanna feel blue Bad girl, drunk by six Kissing someone else's lips Smoked too many cigarettes today I'm not heavy when I actually spray Bad girl, drunk by six Kissing some kind of stranger's lips Smoked too many cigarettes

18:15.539 --> 18:37.665
I don't want to feel blue Bad girl, drunk by six Kissing someone else's lips Smoked too many cigarettes today I'm not happy when I act this way Bad girl, drunk by six Kissing someone else's lips

18:58.081 --> 19:26.029
Kissing some kind of stranger's head Madonna hits the skids as Bad Boy falls to number 24 But the success of his first pop hit just might force him to hit the road and play a few concerts at the theme parks Although I'm sure he won't mind Off from 25 to 21 on the hit list, check out Joey Lawrence Nothing My Love Can't Fix Why is my baby blue?

19:27.865 --> 19:33.235
I can't see the go-through of a sunny day.

19:33.616 --> 19:35.199
I'm stuck in that point of view.

19:37.383 --> 19:42.152
What can I do to take your tears away?

19:42.172 --> 19:44.397
Oh, nothing, nothing.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.701
There's a time for crying.

20:27.097 --> 20:31.846
We'll stop forgetting you were ever down.

20:31.866 --> 20:36.915
I guess it will dry your eyes.

20:36.935 --> 20:45.851
This is the way to turn your world around.

20:45.871 --> 20:46.232
We all get lonely.

20:46.252 --> 20:47.434
But if you just hold me, we both can go beat.

21:19.831 --> 21:21.488
Love is the clue that fun

21:47.438 --> 21:51.205
Love works like magic, just don't be enough.

22:36.595 --> 23:04.257
You gotta get away with me today Cause all the past got to shout through And honey, I got to see it too That we were men, girl, me and you But lately you've been acting like I smell like a zoo Village seems to be exact And hey, feel is my origin as a matter of fact But let's get back to this so you get happy Baby, baby, baby, oh, you was back in the man When I look at you, girl My heart goes right into the world And all I gotta say about the situation

23:09.012 --> 23:10.934
There's nothing my love can't fix.

23:11.234 --> 23:19.423
He's got a successful TV career, all kinds of merit proposals from women he's never met, and a song that jumps into the number 21 spot this week on the hit list.

23:20.124 --> 23:21.886
Obviously, a life worth living.

23:22.246 --> 23:24.188
Joey Lawrence, Nothing My Love Can't Fix.

23:24.569 --> 23:31.877
There's a place in your heart, and I know that it is love.

23:31.897 --> 23:34.159
And this place came much brighter than tomorrow.

23:37.565 --> 23:56.299
you'll find there's no need to cry in this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow there are ways to get there if you care enough for the living make a little space

24:01.882 --> 24:19.158
Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race.

24:19.178 --> 24:20.320
There are people lying if you care enough for the living.

24:20.340 --> 24:21.122
Make a better place for you and for me.

24:27.667 --> 24:53.893
There's a love that cannot lie Love is strong and only cares for joyful giving If we try, we shall see In this bliss we cannot feel Here on track, we stop existing and start living Then it feels that always Love's enough, hope is growing

25:02.193 --> 25:26.698
make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race there are people dying if you care enough

25:33.091 --> 25:58.390
Then why do you keep strangling me When this very crucified soul Though it's plain to see This world is heavenly Because love We could fly so high That our spirits never die In my heart I feel you are all my brothers I created a world

25:59.720 --> 26:16.227
Together we'll cry happy tears So the nations turn their swords into plowshares We could really get there If you cared enough for the living Make a little space

26:22.838 --> 26:38.856
make it a better place

26:51.290 --> 27:17.550
and the anti-human race

27:24.365 --> 27:52.752
I say it's a river

27:53.744 --> 28:11.572
They say it's a blessing.

28:11.652 --> 28:18.823
They say it's a gift.

28:19.799 --> 28:46.715
They say it's a miracle and I believe that it is.

28:46.735 --> 28:47.056
It conquers all.

28:47.076 --> 28:47.456
But it's a mystery.

28:47.476 --> 28:47.937
Love brings your heart.

28:47.957 --> 28:48.658
Love takes no less than everything.

28:49.280 --> 29:09.727
Love makes it hard, and it fades away so easily.

29:09.747 --> 29:11.710
In this world we've created, in this place that we live, in the blink of a night, babe,

29:21.443 --> 29:42.303
Unites the lovers for eternity.

29:42.323 --> 29:42.784
Love breaks the chains.

29:42.804 --> 29:45.206
Love aches for every one of us.

29:45.226 --> 29:48.109
Love takes the tears and pain and turns it in to the beauty that remains.

29:55.042 --> 30:13.135
It was paradise but now it's dying I'll pray for love I'll take my chances that it's not true to live

30:48.569 --> 30:52.217
Thank you.
