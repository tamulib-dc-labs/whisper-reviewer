WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:06.471
Three feet, so the bottom four rows.

00:06.751 --> 00:10.816
Do you have a rough idea of how much material?

00:10.956 --> 00:14.960
I can't think of that.

00:15.021 --> 00:17.223
Do you have a system of prioritization?

00:17.263 --> 00:18.224
Yes, definitely.

00:18.244 --> 00:21.027
How are you going about prioritizing materials?

00:21.047 --> 00:23.330
Materials that can't be replaced.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.874
These are all priority one.

00:26.934 --> 00:28.876
No, what's on the talk shop is dry.

00:29.437 --> 00:30.358
I see, okay.

00:31.115 --> 00:32.358
That's priority two.

00:32.980 --> 00:36.369
Priority one is the material obviously that was wet.

00:36.489 --> 00:37.793
Right, that was an easy one.

00:37.813 --> 00:44.230
But I mean, I don't mean priority in terms of... I mean, priority in terms of...

00:44.581 --> 00:56.268
And so, would you say that this is the area which was in terms of irreplaceable, the most afflicted area?

00:56.288 --> 00:57.451
I can't say that.

00:57.852 --> 00:59.556
I don't know.

00:59.576 --> 01:01.119
What, more than government documents?

01:01.179 --> 01:03.585
I can't say that.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.403
I realize you're very busy.

01:07.463 --> 01:09.606
Down in the corner there are science project books.

01:09.626 --> 01:11.609
You can take them with you if you want.

01:11.749 --> 01:15.594
They are replaceable, not worth that much money, and I don't care.

01:15.654 --> 01:16.435
Nobody cares.

01:16.976 --> 01:21.001
We can go to the stacks and replace that collection, even if it's wet.

01:21.301 --> 01:23.124
So those aren't on any priority.

01:23.144 --> 01:25.226
So they are probably not going to go to Fort Worth.

01:25.246 --> 01:25.607
Correct.

01:26.228 --> 01:27.269
They're not going to go.

01:27.289 --> 01:29.552
Okay, well, this is what I'm asking.

01:29.572 --> 01:31.294
The stuff that was all over the floor here.

01:31.527 --> 01:39.397
You know, we've got someone here, we've got some book jackets with no books anymore, and we're trying to make a list so we'll at least know what was gone.

01:39.857 --> 01:46.546
The shelf list to this department is now being microfilmed because at least we'll have a record of what we used to have.

01:47.427 --> 01:49.429
You seem to be really very organized.

01:49.450 --> 01:52.253
Do you have a kind of an emergency plan?

01:52.452 --> 01:54.294
We did not have a plan, no.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.377
So this is all pretty much by the seat of everyone's plan?

01:57.397 --> 02:00.080
We're very professional, responsible.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.441
We're science librarians.

02:01.481 --> 02:02.422
We came up with a plan.

02:02.442 --> 02:03.123
That's great.

02:03.343 --> 02:04.644
What's your phone extension?

02:04.664 --> 02:06.946
Maybe I'll call you like next week when things settle down.

02:07.447 --> 02:08.528
It was 265.

02:08.548 --> 02:10.130
It was down here.

02:10.350 --> 02:11.391
We're not going to be down here.

02:11.491 --> 02:12.772
And Meryl, what's your title?

02:13.053 --> 02:14.354
Curator, science reference.

02:14.434 --> 02:18.578
I know Billy Connor, the Los Angeles Public Library, and these people went through all this.

02:18.710 --> 02:20.514
which is in my book, by the way.

02:20.534 --> 02:21.015
Is it?

02:21.095 --> 02:22.418
All right, we'll get an autograph.

02:22.438 --> 02:23.259
Thank you so much.

02:23.279 --> 02:24.843
Would you mind if I take a few photographs?

02:25.143 --> 02:26.767
Yes, go right ahead.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.069
Okay, thank you.

02:28.089 --> 02:28.590
I understand.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.013
Thank you.

02:31.436 --> 02:33.360
You're doing wonderfully.

02:34.133 --> 02:40.064
She said she knows my book.

02:40.164 --> 02:48.239
Yeah, I read his book.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.188
You want to just walk me around?

02:57.539 --> 03:08.194
Everyone is very upset.

03:08.294 --> 03:09.055
I'm sorry?

03:09.075 --> 03:10.357
You're also losing records and CDs.

03:10.377 --> 03:11.238
Records and CDs?

03:11.278 --> 03:21.553
Do you have a rough idea of... No, I mean, I just... You were saying, is it just books, so if you talk to Mr. Margolis, you should get an idea.

03:21.693 --> 03:22.534
Okay.

03:22.514 --> 03:23.656
I understand.

03:23.696 --> 03:28.102
But records, vinyl records, are they badly damaged by water as well?

03:28.402 --> 03:29.804
I found there yesterday.

03:31.507 --> 03:35.793
I'm not sure if the records are badly damaged.

03:35.813 --> 03:37.475
Ed Benninger is the one to talk to.

03:37.976 --> 03:41.040
However... Who's the one to talk to?

03:41.681 --> 03:42.222
Ed.

03:42.282 --> 03:42.642
F-E-N-N.

03:42.802 --> 03:43.563
Okay, good.

03:43.584 --> 03:44.405
I-N-G.

03:44.945 --> 03:49.652
However, there's a lot of checking because some of the records have been...

03:50.425 --> 03:52.888
cut and moist, and they need to be clean.

03:53.369 --> 03:54.531
What's your name, sir?

03:54.551 --> 03:55.872
Henry Scannell.

03:55.892 --> 03:57.114
Henry Scannell.

03:57.955 --> 03:59.017
S-E-A-N-N-E-L.

03:59.157 --> 03:59.998
And what do you do, sir?

04:00.338 --> 04:01.861
I'm a microforms librarian.

04:02.161 --> 04:04.564
Microforms.

04:04.865 --> 04:07.048
Yes, it's all microfilm.

04:07.488 --> 04:13.036
Okay, and do you have a rough idea of what the loss is?

04:13.116 --> 04:16.460
I realize everybody's talking about it.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.203
Well, it's in the tens of thousands.

04:18.223 --> 04:19.825
I'm not sure if it's a loss.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.421
Oh, damn it.

04:22.442 --> 04:24.724
So I don't think you have any idea you have a block.

04:24.784 --> 04:30.931
Do you work the same way to save by performance, to go through the same freezing?

04:30.951 --> 04:33.033
I believe that's what they're planning on.

04:33.313 --> 04:35.736
And so what are we looking at here?

04:35.756 --> 04:38.079
These are a set of Canadian patents.

04:38.619 --> 04:43.064
Are these also, as Marilyn said, irreplaceable kinds of things?

04:44.886 --> 04:48.310
No.

04:48.492 --> 04:53.536
Microfilm, by its nature, you can buy a new copy.

04:53.556 --> 04:55.798
However, if you can afford it, you can buy a new copy.

04:55.839 --> 04:57.800
She said that stuff is irreplaceable.

04:57.820 --> 05:00.102
How is it irreplaceable over there?

05:00.122 --> 05:01.163
Because nobody else has copies.

05:01.624 --> 05:04.026
Nobody else has copies.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.567
I presume that's what she meant.

05:06.268 --> 05:12.613
I'm not sure what she was referring to when she read it.

05:12.633 --> 05:16.677
But with film,

05:17.028 --> 05:22.655
Generally, it's purchased from a commercial institution, and they have the negative, so a new copy can be made.

05:23.196 --> 05:26.680
So a price can be replaced?

05:26.700 --> 05:30.505
No, you're taking these out singly, one at a time?

05:30.645 --> 05:38.034
No, I've been taking them out in blocks, and they'll be going like the books to be frozen and dried.

05:38.875 --> 05:45.583
I don't know how much of it is going to be irreplaceably damaged.

05:46.205 --> 05:50.592
I'm not really in the conservation part of it.

05:50.712 --> 05:52.455
I understand.

05:52.555 --> 05:59.726
Mr. Stuart Walker, who is the person in the book, is very nauseous.

05:59.746 --> 06:04.493
He is going to actually take you.

06:04.513 --> 06:08.319
You could just have an opportunity to be in contact.

06:08.339 --> 06:11.323
This will go out if necessary, if it's tooth badly damaged.

06:11.343 --> 06:12.465
The film can be replaced.

06:12.631 --> 06:40.022
However, whether or not we can afford to replace it is another question.

06:44.558 --> 06:52.913
All right.

06:52.933 --> 06:53.134
All right.

06:54.852 --> 07:19.362
Can you just shoot a couple of tracks?

07:19.382 --> 07:20.263
Can you just shoot a couple of catch tracks?

07:20.283 --> 07:21.544
I'm sorry I got a couple of tracks and what they're doing here.

07:21.564 --> 07:22.125
Whatever artists need to do.

07:44.701 --> 08:04.406
Okay.

08:04.426 --> 08:13.457
I would like to check on the emotional stability of one of our employees.

08:13.477 --> 08:13.577
Okay.

08:15.430 --> 08:30.270
Okay.

08:41.104 --> 08:41.405
You're all set?

08:41.425 --> 08:41.785
Thank you so much.

08:41.805 --> 08:42.026
No problem.

08:42.046 --> 08:42.887
Have you gone into the first... I haven't.

08:42.907 --> 08:43.007
Okay.

08:47.527 --> 08:58.139
Oh, yes, okay.

08:58.540 --> 09:02.344
He said we're in the government documents.

09:02.364 --> 09:06.409
This is the government documents reading room and reference material.

09:06.469 --> 09:10.413
This gentleman is writing a book on, I guess, libraries in general, is it?

09:10.433 --> 09:13.137
Culture, preservation, technology.

09:13.417 --> 09:17.061
Art said he could come down and do that.

09:17.345 --> 09:20.773
Yeah, if you want to, I don't know.

09:20.854 --> 09:24.402
Actually, you said you have about five minutes worth of stuff to do?

09:24.462 --> 09:25.184
Yeah, I just go.

09:25.204 --> 09:28.613
So how about if I just wander around and take a few shots on the defense?

09:30.758 --> 09:32.943
Why don't you stay here sort of where I can find you?

09:32.963 --> 09:33.505
Okay, I'll be here.

09:33.565 --> 09:33.906
Great.

09:33.926 --> 09:35.269
Yep.

10:12.087 --> 10:20.832
uh...

10:47.609 --> 11:14.207
This one is fixed, but I think no, it's part of the same thing.

11:18.946 --> 11:46.017
This is an area which brought all of the areas that were in a deep dark scary

11:46.132 --> 11:49.436
19th century basement until a few years ago.

11:49.456 --> 12:01.011
And about 68 and 64, until how many years ago, I'm sorry?

12:01.491 --> 12:06.958
And this was all... The office of renovating the old building began several years ago, but I would say we occupied this space

12:07.192 --> 12:08.594
Maybe about two years ago.

12:10.116 --> 12:17.265
So it was renovated, and I see obviously you have computer equipment.

12:17.285 --> 12:18.246
Well, right.

12:18.367 --> 12:19.608
Everything you see is new.

12:19.628 --> 12:20.069
Everything.

12:20.089 --> 12:29.281
The structure of the ceilings, the treatment of the columns, there was nice carpeting, you know, there's been nice lighting, there's been all this computer work.

12:29.361 --> 12:33.226
So there was carpeting that's already been renewed.

12:33.246 --> 12:36.490
It's imperative to get off the carpeting to begin to lower the relative humidity.

12:36.925 --> 12:38.166
So that's done immediately.

12:38.527 --> 12:40.529
Just give me your full name again.

12:40.649 --> 12:42.331
Stuart, S-T-U-A-R-T.

12:42.351 --> 12:43.972
S-T-U-A-R-T.

12:44.232 --> 12:45.614
Do you use a middle initial?

12:45.954 --> 12:46.235
I don't.

12:46.895 --> 12:48.817
And Rare Books?

12:49.498 --> 12:52.341
I'm the book conservator.

12:52.461 --> 12:53.722
That's your point.

12:54.823 --> 12:56.225
The conservator.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.108
That's within the Rare Book Department.

12:59.128 --> 13:01.330
Within Rare Book.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.462
What's your extension here?

13:03.482 --> 13:07.407
I want to obviously call you back when you have a little time.

13:07.427 --> 13:07.687
431.

13:07.707 --> 13:07.967
431.

13:08.007 --> 13:12.252
So what's the most important thing you do immediately after a crisis like this?

13:12.953 --> 13:16.437
The initial thing that you've got to do is establish priorities.

13:16.457 --> 13:16.577
Right.

13:16.597 --> 13:19.220
Decide what you're going to salvage, because you can't salvage everything.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.945
You've got to sort of first acknowledge that you're not going to be able to save everything.

13:23.965 --> 13:27.469
Once you've done that, then you begin to triage.

13:28.411 --> 13:31.835
and you begin to say, you know, what's going to live, what's going to die, essentially.

13:32.436 --> 13:41.828
And quickly, as quickly as possible, do the appropriate thing to salvage those materials, which in most cases means freezing it.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.371
Freezing buys you time.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.553
And this is established procedure, right?

13:46.573 --> 13:47.354
Yes, yes.

13:47.414 --> 13:48.556
Freezing buys you time.

13:48.596 --> 13:50.598
You can always, you know, it's already wet.

13:50.618 --> 13:52.240
You can always re-wet it by thawing.

13:52.881 --> 13:56.005
Or if you can't, depending on what the material is,

13:56.491 --> 14:09.453
you can freeze dry material, which is actually removing, once you've frozen the material, you remove the water vapor directly from ice without being passed back through the water phase.

14:10.074 --> 14:16.805
You go through a process called sublimation chemically, which is dropping a vacuum.

14:16.865 --> 14:21.633
I can't remember technically exactly what, but we can find that out for you.

14:21.673 --> 14:22.735
Drawing a vacuum,

14:23.002 --> 14:35.983
adding a slight amount of heat, I think in this case it's going to be about 15 degrees Fahrenheit, at that atmospheric pressure with that heat, water boils.

14:37.345 --> 14:42.553
So you've got boiling water, but you don't have boiling liquid water because it's too cold.

14:43.615 --> 14:49.785
So essentially what happens to your wet wash on a winter day on the line,

14:50.153 --> 14:55.241
The wind, you know, it freezes stiff as a board, and then a few hours later, it's dry.

14:55.842 --> 14:57.865
It went out wet, it froze, it dried.

14:58.927 --> 15:02.332
Let me ask a question.

15:02.392 --> 15:03.894
This happened over the weekend, right?

15:04.335 --> 15:08.481
Yeah, it happened Sunday morning, about 31 o'clock in the morning.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.603
So when did you hear about it?

15:10.144 --> 15:12.187
I heard about it Sunday evening.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.212
So several hours after that?

15:15.232 --> 15:16.133
Oh, yeah, several hours.

15:16.173 --> 15:18.557
I mean, first off, there were just hours of...

15:18.858 --> 15:26.250
of public works people, fire trucks, custodial staff from here saying, you know, we can't stop it, we can't stop it.

15:26.270 --> 15:30.377
So the water was just... It was a few inches deep.

15:31.659 --> 15:32.961
Then it was six inches deep.

15:33.121 --> 15:34.544
And so on.

15:34.644 --> 15:36.647
And the custodial staff kept calling.

15:37.066 --> 15:41.232
Oh, about 2 o'clock, I guess, they became really alerted that things were desperately bad.

15:41.312 --> 15:47.180
But 3 o'clock, they started making serious calls, 4, 5 o'clock.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.466
The response all began happening since there's staff here at all times.

15:52.347 --> 15:58.416
And Public Works, I guess, notified the staff that there was a water main break.

15:59.155 --> 16:06.305
The custodial staff that was here at the time came to check it out, and then they began to call people as it became clear that it was getting out of control.

16:06.365 --> 16:07.887
What time did you arrive on the scene?

16:08.428 --> 16:15.238
Oh, not until I came home from vacation after two weeks, growing a beard.

16:15.758 --> 16:21.106
And the first thing that happens Sunday night is, you know, hi, guess what?

16:21.126 --> 16:23.089
First call was, don't come in, the library is closed.

16:23.129 --> 16:24.150
Second call was,

16:24.586 --> 16:25.287
Can you come in?

16:25.307 --> 16:26.328
We need your expertise.

16:27.009 --> 16:28.291
So, that's fine.

16:28.311 --> 16:30.354
I arrived about 8 o'clock in the morning on Monday.

16:30.414 --> 16:34.680
And was the place fully engulfed in water when you arrived here?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.443
Engulfed is not the right word.

16:36.863 --> 16:37.184
No.

16:37.464 --> 16:50.863
It had gone from about 30 to 36 or so inches of water down to, oh, you know, slogging through it with boots.

16:50.962 --> 17:02.818
But the lights were all off, and it was a truly nightmarish situation of blackened rooms with flashlight beams crisscrossing back and forth and reflecting on the water and things dripping.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.503
What's the approximate square footage in this space?

17:06.623 --> 17:07.464
I don't know.

17:07.564 --> 17:08.705
I'm not really bad at that.

17:08.725 --> 17:12.791
But do we believe there are about 100,000 items down here or in excess?

17:12.911 --> 17:19.720
All told, all told, in the reading rooms and in the stacks, which I want to take you into,

17:20.003 --> 17:32.586
I think we figure there are close to a million items.

17:32.726 --> 17:44.307
In printed format alone, and that does not mean, yeah, in printed format we have approximately

17:44.793 --> 17:49.961
Yeah, I'd say 987,000 plus 6,200, whatever that comes out to.

17:49.981 --> 17:50.903
6,200 what?

17:50.943 --> 17:55.310
6,200, those are reference volumes like in these rooms.

17:55.370 --> 17:56.552
Okay, I see.

17:56.652 --> 18:05.245
And documents and other... Documents makes you feel like a single sheet of paper, but in fact, we're talking about government documents for publications.

18:05.866 --> 18:06.948
So paperback publications.

18:06.968 --> 18:08.170
Does that include microfilm?

18:08.651 --> 18:09.352
No.

18:09.372 --> 18:10.834
Then you go to microfiche,

18:10.949 --> 18:16.476
5,940,000, approximately 6 million microfiche.

18:17.677 --> 18:17.837
Wow.

18:19.379 --> 18:27.889
The low estimate of the damaged fiche is about 40%, so over two and a quarter million.

18:30.332 --> 18:31.994
Two and a quarter million items?

18:32.014 --> 18:33.075
Yes, of fiche.

18:33.258 --> 18:41.100
So when they were saying 100,000 in the paper, that's just a fragment of the story.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.406
That's not correct.

18:44.570 --> 18:45.572
Let's talk about books.

18:45.893 --> 18:49.022
Now, the reason they came up with that is we have here

18:49.897 --> 18:50.839
Okay, great.

18:50.859 --> 18:51.961
So things are moving down.

18:51.981 --> 18:57.312
If we figure 30% of what's available down here is lost, we would figure about 296,000.

18:57.412 --> 19:03.124
But that's a very, very highest end of what's down there.

19:03.705 --> 19:06.050
We don't think it's that high.

19:06.070 --> 19:07.292
We think it's about half that.

19:07.312 --> 19:11.601
So we'd say probably 100,000 or so is about right.

19:11.581 --> 19:12.282
We won't know.

19:12.743 --> 19:18.351
Are you working under the rubric of the rare books department?

19:18.371 --> 19:18.732
Yeah.

19:18.752 --> 19:21.916
How much of this material is irreplaceable in your view?

19:21.996 --> 19:24.039
Well, of course, none of this is rare book material.

19:24.340 --> 19:28.246
In fact, you certainly haven't understood what we're talking about.

19:28.266 --> 19:33.493
Yeah, no, I understand what you mean, of course.

19:33.574 --> 19:37.960
The 19th century German patent material would probably be almost irreplaceable.

19:38.480 --> 19:45.006
We are the library of last recourse for much of the eastern coast of the United States, certainly the northeast region.

19:45.026 --> 19:46.468
The library of last recourse for what?

19:46.628 --> 19:48.410
The northeast region of the United States.

19:48.430 --> 19:49.110
For American?

19:49.130 --> 19:49.971
For government documents.

19:51.032 --> 19:51.533
And for?

19:52.814 --> 19:53.314
One section of it.

19:53.334 --> 19:55.156
Yeah, state and federal.

19:55.897 --> 19:59.120
And this is colonial and microfiche form?

19:59.140 --> 20:02.643
No, microfiche and paper.

20:02.663 --> 20:06.527
The patent material, I'm not sure if that's, I don't frankly remember whether the patent material is.

20:06.547 --> 20:07.508
This goes back to?

20:07.910 --> 20:08.571
No, I haven't.

20:09.192 --> 20:10.414
I haven't seen Marilyn.

20:10.494 --> 20:13.518
I got down here about 12 o'clock and I'd be... Yeah, well, I know where you were.

20:14.019 --> 20:16.323
Yeah, well, that's true.

20:16.363 --> 20:17.224
You're right, of course.

20:17.244 --> 20:18.045
You were there, too.

20:18.065 --> 20:21.991
So you mentioned the kind of triage procedure.

20:22.311 --> 20:23.954
Let me just finish that up.

20:26.117 --> 20:27.179
The patent material.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.243
Material on patents.

20:30.684 --> 20:32.907
When I say material, it's actually just the information.

20:32.947 --> 20:34.069
Who said what patent?

20:34.555 --> 20:35.056
What is it?

20:35.076 --> 20:35.836
What are the details?

20:36.437 --> 20:38.720
We get patent searches here.

20:42.103 --> 20:46.308
That's over in Science, primarily.

20:47.529 --> 20:52.835
I have the figures up here, but I can't remember what they are, but a huge number of hits for patent numbers.

20:52.995 --> 20:54.677
I mean, again, Art would probably tell you that.

20:54.697 --> 20:56.880
He was at the meeting, too.

20:56.900 --> 20:57.901
I can call you and get this.

20:59.062 --> 21:01.845
Yeah, I can sometimes get that together.

21:02.213 --> 21:18.537
Patents, there's something called the ANSI standards, A-N-S-I, American something, Science Institute, maybe.

21:18.557 --> 21:22.443
The ANSI standards are incredibly valuable.

21:22.463 --> 21:27.531
The patents, those are the two things that I keep hearing talk about all the time.

21:28.572 --> 21:29.233
Over here,

21:29.618 --> 21:31.360
You will like the snoring, I think.

21:31.600 --> 21:36.627
Over here, there's a lower shelf, and the lower shelves got soaked.

21:37.187 --> 21:45.878
The material expanded to about one and a half times its original shape.

21:45.898 --> 21:51.205
It wedged itself between the oak board and could not be physically removed.

21:51.605 --> 21:53.888
We had ten men and a boy, that kind of thing.

21:54.222 --> 22:14.728
yanking on the bottom shelf of books that could not get them out there was over behind that on that wall over there there was one little tiny red down volume um about so high surrounded by towering other materials which had all expanded over it like the leaves of a tree

22:16.210 --> 22:23.942
It contains the index to census records for the United States from 1790 to 1972 with penciled notations.

22:24.202 --> 22:33.657
The only copies, the only notations of where that material is to be found within this library couldn't physically be removed from the shelf.

22:33.677 --> 22:37.543
We actually had to use a three-foot crowbar.

22:38.131 --> 22:50.389
to crowbar the material out of the shelves, thereby deciding, speaking of triage, what item are we going to hook the crowbar on, which one of these reference books.

22:50.409 --> 22:51.570
So they had to do it.

22:52.632 --> 22:53.233
They determined.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.616
That's the nice thing about government documents.

22:55.636 --> 22:56.698
Most of them are replaceable.

22:56.818 --> 22:59.121
You know, they're government crying about publications.

22:59.842 --> 23:04.029
So I mean, here were things with, well, yes, we don't want to lose that, but no, we can replace that.

23:04.830 --> 23:05.210
OK.

23:05.791 --> 23:06.672
Get the Masonite.

23:06.692 --> 23:07.834
Get the .

23:08.118 --> 23:17.875
It took a lot, even with the three-foot crowbar, it took 20 minutes of hard work to get it out.

23:18.976 --> 23:22.022
Nothing I ever expected to do in my life.

23:22.042 --> 23:28.172
So to go back though, I mean, you said you were making life and death decisions on you can't save everything.

23:28.292 --> 23:32.860
So what kind of snap decisions were you making?

23:33.177 --> 23:35.521
I wasn't, because I'm not a curator in this.

23:35.661 --> 23:39.748
Those decisions were being left up to the curators in each department.

23:39.768 --> 23:41.291
But time was of the essence.

23:41.371 --> 23:55.795
Yes, but you have about 48 hours before— I mean, the critical thing is not only getting the material salvaged and up off the ground, but you have about 48 hours before mold begins to grow.

23:56.837 --> 23:58.560
When the collection begins to get moldy,

23:58.658 --> 24:05.829
You're faced with a catastrophic loss, irreplaceable loss.

24:05.849 --> 24:12.438
This stuff we can send off to be freeze-dried, and they'll come back to you, oddly enough, looking almost like nothing happened to it.

24:12.558 --> 24:15.643
Yes, because it'll be dirty, but it'll be surface dirt, and you can brush it off.

24:16.224 --> 24:21.171
The freeze-drying actually sucks dirt that's embedded itself in the material to the top of the page.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.573
You can brush that dirt off.

24:23.060 --> 24:26.365
Many times they'll come back unwarped, undamaged.

24:26.385 --> 24:28.909
Now this Fort Worth group that you got in, you got them?

24:29.470 --> 24:38.884
Yeah, but after we lost the day to city haggling because of being a bureaucracy, being a city library, well, I'm sorry, we need three competitive bids.

24:39.505 --> 24:40.847
Jesus.

24:40.887 --> 24:44.472
Yeah, so we had to deal with that, and that went until 11 o'clock one night.

24:44.492 --> 24:46.215
Are there three companies that do this?

24:46.246 --> 24:47.428
Of course not.

24:47.528 --> 24:53.716
And there are different aspects of different... There's the dehumidification services, the chilling services, the freeze-drying services, the crates.

24:54.998 --> 24:57.621
You know, some people could supply one but not the other.

24:57.981 --> 25:06.853
So the city had to get on and get its you-know-what out of you-know-where and acknowledge the fact that, oh, this is different.

25:07.654 --> 25:11.319
That happened, but we lost many hours.

25:11.579 --> 25:12.861
We've got good people in.

25:13.297 --> 25:15.819
They're addressing the issues.

25:15.900 --> 25:24.848
We've already filled up and had taken away one 48-foot refrigerated truck, which blast-froze everything that came into it.

25:24.988 --> 25:27.071
Where are these trucks home-ported?

25:27.271 --> 25:27.811
Did they come up?

25:27.831 --> 25:30.534
We sort of rent them from Joe's.

25:31.335 --> 25:32.936
For meats, even.

25:33.577 --> 25:37.341
The city has its own contacts that it was utilizing.

25:37.641 --> 25:41.785
Once the contract is then awarded, we made it very clear

25:42.018 --> 25:43.222
and the stuff had to be frozen.

25:43.343 --> 25:44.527
Okay, they could go that far.

25:44.787 --> 25:51.230
And they have a company called ServiceMaster who's known to the city, who's a normal city contract.

25:51.811 --> 25:52.855
They do do...

25:53.155 --> 25:54.536
I mean, they had access to the freezer.

25:54.556 --> 25:55.698
They're the ones who brought in the lights.

25:55.718 --> 25:58.941
They brought in the snakey yellow things with the chilled air.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.743
What are those yellow things for?

26:00.763 --> 26:04.687
They bring cold, refrigerated air into the... So what do you call them?

26:04.727 --> 26:07.810
They're just tubes of some sort, I guess.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.512
Snakey yellow coils.

26:10.693 --> 26:12.294
But they bring in chilled air.

26:12.314 --> 26:15.778
Yes, and that's being pumped in from outside the building.

26:15.798 --> 26:18.861
And again, the purpose to do that is to... Lower the temperature.

26:19.722 --> 26:20.883
Three things that you have to do.

26:20.923 --> 26:22.825
Lower the temperature.

26:23.243 --> 26:25.966
dehumidify and circulate the air.

26:26.026 --> 26:28.669
So we have little air blowers, fans everywhere.

26:29.230 --> 26:29.991
We've got chillers.

26:30.592 --> 26:36.719
And unfortunately, we weren't able to bring in the dehumidifiers early for a two-fold problem.

26:36.759 --> 26:41.685
The first was because the city was dicking around with its business of what to provide what.

26:42.225 --> 26:48.913
The second was that much of the electricity was fried.

26:49.214 --> 26:54.539
in here, and so you have to be able to plug your dehumidifier into something.

26:54.559 --> 27:00.064
So we had to restore electrical service before we could actually get the dehumidifiers going.

27:00.204 --> 27:06.429
Even until last night, the electricity in the library was not able to support the machinery.

27:06.629 --> 27:07.830
As of this morning, it is.

27:08.191 --> 27:13.255
I'm not necessarily asking you to comment on this, but maybe you will.

27:13.315 --> 27:17.719
What I'm really so impressed by is that the attitude is that we have to save as much as we can.

27:18.256 --> 27:38.779
I bet makes that sound pretty obvious, but you know, if I were to tell you in the San Francisco Public Library, when there was an earthquake out there in 1989, the then librarian was quoted as saying, and I asked him this, Ken Dallin, and he confirmed it, that he saw that as an opportunity to clean out the RGU stables.

27:39.755 --> 27:43.160
What a great opportunity to get rid of a bunch of shit, in other words.

27:43.220 --> 28:04.551
Well, I was just at a trustees meeting, and someone at the end of the meeting made the kind of sly remark that some people are not, I mean, obviously everybody's devastated, but some people have said this is a great opportunity to get rid of a lot of the direct that we've wanted to get rid of for years.

28:04.571 --> 28:06.374
And do you agree with that?

28:06.554 --> 28:07.315
Do you agree with that?

28:07.582 --> 28:08.183
Well, I don't know.

28:08.203 --> 28:09.724
I mean, again, I don't work here.

28:09.744 --> 28:15.710
I work in rare books, so you wouldn't want to necessarily... I mean, he actually has some drag in rare books.

28:16.051 --> 28:16.851
What's wrong with that?

28:16.931 --> 28:18.353
I mean, Marilyn told me down there to do something.

28:18.373 --> 28:19.354
Well, let me show you.

28:19.374 --> 28:20.195
There are science books.

28:20.215 --> 28:22.137
She says, you can take all you want with you when you go.

28:24.099 --> 28:27.802
We can replace them.

28:27.822 --> 28:31.286
But, for example, I'll show you one thing.

28:31.486 --> 28:32.307
Okay.

28:35.324 --> 28:37.548
Let's go back and around.

28:37.568 --> 28:37.668
Okay.

28:42.817 --> 28:44.661
I'm so glad I came in today.

28:44.681 --> 28:50.812
This is, this is, I can guarantee you, this is going to be the, I just know this.

28:50.852 --> 28:54.278
Now you're writing a book, you have a little place, and you're writing non-fiction books, you have to,

28:54.528 --> 29:00.715
Five little things.

29:03.898 --> 29:14.149
Go ahead.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.151
I'm sorry.

29:15.171 --> 29:19.035
All right.

29:19.055 --> 29:19.255
Look here.

29:19.275 --> 29:19.475
I'm sorry.

29:19.495 --> 29:19.996
Can I just do the visual?

29:20.016 --> 29:20.096
Yep.

29:20.116 --> 29:20.376
Oh, wow.

29:20.516 --> 29:20.616
Yeah.

29:20.637 --> 29:20.757
Great.

29:20.777 --> 29:22.218
Do you want to get over it?

29:22.238 --> 29:22.819
I'm not sure what's going on.

29:22.839 --> 29:23.359
I'm just going to shut it.

29:23.379 --> 29:23.480
Yeah.

29:23.500 --> 29:23.860
How are you doing?

29:24.582 --> 29:51.187
I'm sorry, thank you.

29:51.207 --> 29:52.088
So, yeah, I mean, this is what we're facing.

29:52.108 --> 29:52.729
And here's the air circulation.

29:52.749 --> 29:53.009
We have many.

29:53.029 --> 29:53.750
We have a little portable power fan.

29:53.770 --> 29:54.150
Here's the storage.

29:55.767 --> 30:18.534
The force of the water not, in part, not matured off the shell.

30:18.554 --> 30:20.697
You see it went up to the second, in some cases about halfway up to the third shell, but mostly the second.

30:20.717 --> 30:21.698
The water line, here's the water line right here.

30:21.718 --> 30:22.018
You can see it.

30:22.038 --> 30:22.198
Oh, wow.

30:22.218 --> 30:22.719
That was edited by twice.

30:22.739 --> 30:23.119
I'm fine, I'm fine.

30:23.139 --> 30:23.520
That's pretty nice.

30:23.540 --> 30:24.841
Yeah, but it didn't, you know, obviously there's a terrible loss.

30:24.862 --> 30:25.302
That's the water line.

30:26.142 --> 30:45.941
Now, if you walk down here, let's go get back over this.

30:46.982 --> 30:48.724
This is the corner where the water man broke.

30:48.744 --> 30:52.468
Partly, partly it looks like the power of the water, but in reality, a lot of why these things have blown up the cells is because they expanded to the point where they suddenly went far.

30:52.488 --> 30:53.709
They just expanded to the point where they suddenly went far.

30:53.729 --> 30:53.989
I don't know.

30:56.669 --> 31:13.589
So where does the mic come from?

31:13.609 --> 31:14.310
I have to do it from the left side.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.091
Oh, yeah, it's 30 days before the end.

31:15.111 --> 31:15.792
Oh, that's 30 days before the end.

31:15.812 --> 31:16.493
Oh, that's 30 days before the end.

31:16.513 --> 31:17.174
I just want to listen to the mic.

31:17.194 --> 31:17.855
I just want to listen to the mic.

31:17.875 --> 31:18.535
I just want to listen to the mic.

31:18.555 --> 31:19.116
I want to listen to the mic.

31:22.015 --> 31:45.445
This is the original material for the 1895 construction of the building, too.

31:45.465 --> 31:45.905
It's a nice claw clip.

31:45.925 --> 31:46.126
Wonderful.

31:46.146 --> 31:47.648
That's the kind of thing I saw at an auction I'd buy in a minute, you know?

31:47.668 --> 31:47.808
I know.

31:47.828 --> 31:48.989
I don't feel like you love anything bibliographic in that.

31:49.009 --> 31:49.590
Oh, this is really something.

31:49.610 --> 31:50.712
Yeah, this is where the... Oh, look here.

31:50.732 --> 31:50.952
Oh, man.

31:50.972 --> 31:51.853
Rivers and parls and mounds, that here is...

31:52.525 --> 32:01.639
It's a foot deep of silt.

32:01.659 --> 32:05.105
Well, it's just... Essentially, this is the corner of the building where it all happened.

32:05.125 --> 32:06.066
We're now in the corner.

32:06.607 --> 32:07.268
What corner?

32:07.288 --> 32:08.109
Where are we with?

32:08.129 --> 32:09.532
Southeast corner.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.715
Southeast corner.

32:11.735 --> 32:13.778
Corner of Dartmouth and Blagden Streets.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.763
Dartmouth?

32:16.783 --> 32:18.405
And what's the name it is?

32:18.466 --> 32:19.267
Blagden.

32:19.287 --> 32:20.068
B-L-A-G-D-E-N.

32:22.782 --> 32:24.423
The street is up there.

32:24.504 --> 32:27.486
Yeah, actually, the street is over there and over there.

32:27.526 --> 32:36.174
We're under a granite platform, which extends out in front of the building, along which sit two mammoths.

32:36.194 --> 32:38.516
And we're in the McKim building, of course, right?

32:38.536 --> 32:41.459
Yeah, this is the original building, 1895.

32:41.479 --> 32:43.381
And this was not a floor in the building or anything.

32:43.401 --> 32:49.626
This was a water main that had nothing... Water main, not far over there, but off the corner here.

32:49.646 --> 32:50.427
And it...

32:51.200 --> 32:54.045
I think it was a 45 inch water pipe.

32:54.145 --> 33:03.362
But if it's about... Either it's just over or almost a hundred degrees over the pipe.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.367
You call it silt or much what do you call this?

33:06.387 --> 33:08.090
Yeah, it's pretty sandy in a way.

33:08.110 --> 33:08.972
Silt, I guess.

33:10.049 --> 33:18.121
Now this stuff we're looking at, this is rough, but it's humid.

33:18.221 --> 33:24.511
But the material you would describe, again, government documents type things?

33:24.531 --> 33:24.911
Yes, right.

33:24.931 --> 33:28.016
So these are, I mean, you figure you've got a million, but you're counting about things like this.

33:28.036 --> 33:30.980
I'm wondering if you'll, well, these are the same.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.672
Well, yeah, but still the humidity down here is such that mold could begin growing on this, and mold dissolves

33:38.855 --> 34:04.223
And he uses a living organism to eat cellulose, because it's made up of cellulose, and he just becomes a fun boy.

34:04.243 --> 34:04.324
Wow.

34:04.344 --> 34:05.605
So a lot of, a lot of accidents come up, and it didn't come up.

34:06.614 --> 34:11.601
I mean, it didn't really come through the wall.

34:11.621 --> 34:12.342
It kind of came weird.

34:12.362 --> 34:15.687
The thing is that actually we don't quite know how it got into the building.

34:15.707 --> 34:16.067
The water?

34:16.227 --> 34:17.689
It came up through the floor.

34:17.910 --> 34:24.499
It came between, you know, where the floor and the wall is.

34:24.519 --> 34:26.782
There's no obvious crack anywhere.

34:26.802 --> 34:30.327
The water just seemed to suddenly bubble up and into the building.

34:32.416 --> 34:40.424
Amazing.

34:44.949 --> 34:52.577
Do you think you'll ever find out?

34:52.597 --> 34:53.378
And the mud came in with it, didn't it?

34:53.398 --> 34:53.618
Yeah, sure.

34:53.638 --> 34:55.280
So it's not just water coming into... There has to be some kind of major eruption.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.561
The entire conference fair was underwater outside of the doors.

34:56.581 --> 34:56.842
Look at that.

34:56.862 --> 34:57.723
That's exactly what you were talking about.

34:57.743 --> 34:58.443
Look how that stuff was forced out.

34:58.463 --> 34:58.704
Yeah, right.

34:58.724 --> 34:58.924
That's it.

34:58.944 --> 34:59.925
There's a funny story on the paper that they say.

35:00.378 --> 35:13.112
in a related matter of a guy in a convertible Mercedes.

35:13.132 --> 35:16.736
I heard about that.

35:16.756 --> 35:18.999
A guy who insisted on going ahead.

35:19.539 --> 35:23.684
A $100 ticket and his car broke down.

35:23.704 --> 35:24.105
And his car got $40.

35:24.125 --> 35:24.405
Just a second.

35:24.425 --> 35:25.086
I think I want to show you still.

35:25.106 --> 35:27.228
I want to take a picture of showing you very volumes here.

35:27.248 --> 35:27.689
So just take a second.

35:27.709 --> 35:27.809
Okay.

35:27.829 --> 35:28.209
I know you're busy.

35:28.229 --> 35:28.950
I thought I'd take a tour some time.

35:32.238 --> 36:01.468
The thing is that it's a base that normally

36:02.883 --> 36:22.428
Most institutions acknowledge or practice their practices.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.149
We don't store things in basements.

36:23.169 --> 36:24.851
We don't store paper-based material in basements because of the high humidity level.

36:24.871 --> 36:25.632
What do you do if you don't have food?

36:25.652 --> 36:26.173
That is the exact problem.

36:26.558 --> 36:29.482
What do you do?

36:29.822 --> 36:33.326
What do you do if you do this?

36:33.346 --> 36:36.430
Basements are basically... I went out to San Francisco where they've got a million items.

36:36.450 --> 36:37.491
You've heard of the Brooks Hall?

36:38.432 --> 36:43.679
You know, when they built the new library, it had less space than the one they were leaving.

36:43.699 --> 36:44.440
I did hear that.

36:44.460 --> 36:52.970
And then, so what they did is they put stuff in an old auditorium underground, which is have the pictures of these pictures or something.

36:52.990 --> 36:55.553
I mean, this is the way stuff has been now for the last few years.

36:55.853 --> 37:20.171
I didn't hear you for a while.

37:20.191 --> 37:21.032
I got a picture of you, if you don't mind.

37:21.052 --> 37:22.414
With those old books as a backdrop and that little snake coil there.

37:22.434 --> 37:22.855
Excellent, thank you.

37:22.875 --> 37:23.155
This is great.

37:23.175 --> 37:24.257
Everything from here is from what I was having to say.

37:24.878 --> 37:26.963
And this, was this a reading room here?

37:26.983 --> 37:28.427
This is where you were.

37:28.527 --> 37:32.437
I mean, this is, we call this a reading room.

37:32.457 --> 37:35.785
There were a lot of lawyers in here all the time.

37:37.549 --> 37:41.419
So undoubtedly things...

37:41.922 --> 37:44.184
Are you sending off everything that's wet to Fort Worth?

37:44.525 --> 37:47.087
Or again, are you prioritizing?

37:47.108 --> 37:54.555
It's going to... At this point, we have most of the really critical stuff of Freezer Crux.

37:54.575 --> 37:59.801
We're going to make a decision about where to store and how to treat the dry material.

37:59.821 --> 38:02.143
The dry material that's humid.

38:02.163 --> 38:06.308
That sign is terrific.

38:06.368 --> 38:11.033
This here.

38:11.053 --> 38:11.153
Okay.

38:12.247 --> 38:16.352
I do everything and take my pictures.

38:17.454 --> 38:25.565
It's a shame the bottom of these limestone pillars here with the dirt that's gotten absorbed into the nuts about where the height of the water was.

38:25.985 --> 38:29.170
It was about at the base of the pillar and then they absorbed them.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.032
We've got it up to the next layer.

38:31.349 --> 38:45.675
Do you think that'll be a permanent situation?

38:45.696 --> 38:45.956
I don't know.

38:45.976 --> 38:46.357
It's all brand new.

38:46.377 --> 38:46.998
It's all brand new in the hall.

38:47.018 --> 38:47.218
Oh, I see.

38:47.238 --> 38:47.339
Yeah.

38:47.359 --> 38:47.880
The stairway didn't exist.

38:47.900 --> 38:48.040
Really?

38:48.060 --> 38:48.120
No.

38:48.140 --> 38:49.402
It's part of the first phase of the renovation of the building.

38:49.422 --> 38:49.763
One more picture.

38:53.388 --> 39:13.044
I think it's Safety Razor Division.

39:13.064 --> 39:13.164
Okay.

39:13.184 --> 39:13.625
Safety Razor Division.

39:13.645 --> 39:13.725
Wow.

39:14.347 --> 39:33.899
And it is the Gillette Corporation, which is a Boston company.

39:33.919 --> 39:34.240
Of course, yeah.

39:34.260 --> 39:35.041
Walmart has donated a lot of materials.

39:35.061 --> 39:37.265
Gillettes, we've got some dairies, local dairies that have donated milk cartons, which can be first described.

39:37.285 --> 39:38.667
It almost is, I mean, you don't want to stretch the medical metaphor,

39:39.237 --> 39:48.527
It really is almost like a medical emergency, isn't it?

39:48.607 --> 39:58.918
I think I'm going to let you go back to your work.

39:59.078 --> 40:08.468
I'd like to give you a call

40:09.089 --> 40:22.326
We've never had a disaster like this here.

40:22.366 --> 40:30.557
We're depending on contactors whom we don't personally have a lot of experience with.

40:31.280 --> 40:36.905
We have to deal with the issues of access to materials over time.

40:36.925 --> 40:41.210
At what point do you think—do you have an idea at all of what we're talking about roughly in terms of money?

40:41.850 --> 40:43.872
Oh, no, I have no idea.

40:43.892 --> 40:44.292
There's no idea.

40:44.313 --> 40:46.134
And even if I knew, I wouldn't mind.

40:46.234 --> 40:48.737
Well, did this company quote per item, or is it time?

40:48.877 --> 40:54.943
It's—I think it's like a linear foot.

40:56.444 --> 40:56.664
Ah.

40:56.684 --> 40:59.447
Do you know what the quote is on that, roughly?

41:00.136 --> 41:04.580
Seems like it was $40 a foot.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.241
That's not bad.

41:05.981 --> 41:08.984
Well, not when you consider the cost of replacement of oil.

41:09.004 --> 41:15.850
Well, I mean, the Sland Bookstore in New York rents books out from $10 to $200 a million a foot.

41:15.870 --> 41:17.392
You know, just for decoration, yeah.

41:18.473 --> 41:19.634
I just wrote a piece about it.

41:19.794 --> 41:20.574
That's fascinating.

41:20.614 --> 41:22.276
I had no idea.

41:22.316 --> 41:25.259
That's all we got to cost you.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.040
That's really interesting.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.962
That's the process for drawing, and then I guess whatever else,

41:29.279 --> 41:44.177
Did you want to see any of the rest of the building?

41:47.662 --> 41:50.625
No, I've been in here hundreds of times.

41:50.645 --> 41:51.206
And I've been coming here.

41:51.226 --> 41:52.367
9 o'clock Monday morning.

41:52.387 --> 41:56.232
9 o'clock on Monday morning, staff came in and immediately sat down.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.583
to determine priorities for saving.

42:00.224 --> 42:06.490
We had lists up on the walls, people on tripods with big sheets of paper and people with magic markers.

42:06.510 --> 42:13.838
Things got fast fired out and then as people further discussed that, items got moved up or down depending on priority.

42:15.160 --> 42:19.004
The staff response has been extraordinary.

42:19.024 --> 42:24.970
I'm kind of a jaded 16-year veteran here who has his issues about

42:25.608 --> 42:31.627
how things are run, as we all do in probably any bureaucratic institution.

42:31.647 --> 42:34.757
And I don't mean it to sound sort of starry-eyed and dewy.

42:35.007 --> 42:39.733
But I'm really proud to end up working in this situation with these people.

42:39.753 --> 42:56.714
You have people who haven't spoken to each other because they're either in the general library or the reference library, or they're professionals or their library assistants, depending on the union they're in, working together, working well, working solidly, accomplishing a tremendous amount of stuff.

42:57.074 --> 42:57.615
Where are you from, Stuart?

42:57.775 --> 42:59.537
Are you from Boston, Massachusetts?

42:59.657 --> 43:01.740
Yeah, Massachusetts.

43:02.210 --> 43:03.532
Did you go to library school?

43:03.932 --> 43:04.673
No, I'm not.

43:04.693 --> 43:10.521
No, as a conservator, I learned really the craft of book finding and paper restoration.

43:10.541 --> 43:15.387
I worked at the Northeast Document Conservation Center, which is the big place to actually go see.

43:15.647 --> 43:17.390
I was in Leipzig last year.

43:17.430 --> 43:20.373
I went actually to see the mass deacidification and stuff.

43:20.414 --> 43:20.954
Leipzig?

43:21.295 --> 43:23.197
I'm really, really serious.

43:23.257 --> 43:30.867
Bookman Grechter, who was at Leipzig for years, pioneered one very interesting...

43:31.167 --> 43:56.297
uh process by which fragile material could be uh delaminated and then the both sides pasted back they have what they call this page splitter yes right and then and then what they have is what they call leaf casting oh yeah well it's very interesting so that's the that's the field i come out is conservation

43:56.598 --> 43:58.982
And I worked, in fact, at the Document Center for four years.

43:59.382 --> 44:06.734
When I left, I was the head of book conservation at NEDCC.

44:06.754 --> 44:14.586
I went into private practice, my wife and baby, couldn't make a living, you know, I just was a bad manager.

44:14.606 --> 44:20.175
I needed to work within the gentle restraining hand of their necessities.

44:20.847 --> 44:26.714
They got a grant here in the Selvester Conservation Lab in 82, and I hired Bob Corcoran.

44:26.734 --> 44:32.820
Do you have a regular structured little books preservation program in place?

44:32.840 --> 44:37.045
Well, yes and no.

44:37.766 --> 44:40.969
Certain aspects of newspapers.

44:40.989 --> 44:43.953
There's a newspaper project for my ongoing newspapers.

44:44.113 --> 44:46.936
And then discarding the old newspapers?

44:46.956 --> 44:47.817
We had a little bit of a survey.

44:48.050 --> 44:51.235
in which, like most other research libraries, we discovered about 35 percent.

44:51.255 --> 44:52.838
I was going to say 30 percent, right.

44:52.858 --> 44:55.563
So that's two million books, two million plus.

44:57.807 --> 44:59.189
Of which figures?

44:59.209 --> 45:01.914
Well, if it's 35 percent, you've got 6.8 billion.

45:01.974 --> 45:03.677
I mean, I'm just doing big enough math on it.

45:03.717 --> 45:06.001
That librarian has about 13 million books.

45:06.021 --> 45:08.024
So the globe had that wrong this morning.

45:09.547 --> 45:11.089
That's one department, one area.

45:11.230 --> 45:13.213
Maybe that's the research library, if you consider.

45:13.598 --> 45:16.081
If you consider the entire system.

45:16.101 --> 45:18.103
So it's much more than just maybe four million.

45:19.044 --> 45:20.225
Are you familiar with the phrase?

45:20.466 --> 45:34.881
I was up at Cornell interested in their pioneering efforts in the digital, the digitization, blah, blah, blah.

45:34.941 --> 45:39.066
They have what they call their phased deterioration.

45:39.367 --> 45:40.609
You ever hear of that expression?

45:42.351 --> 45:58.290
That's a nice way of saying we've made a qualitative decision on certain books not to do it, again, to go back to the medical meta imagery, not to do anything heroic, not to do any invasive procedures, make the book comfortable, and let it die a natural death.

45:58.390 --> 46:08.783
I mean, do you make similar kinds of decisions here on books, books that maybe... We do what's called phase boxing in many cases, which is a quick temporary box for something which...

46:09.235 --> 46:13.239
is either falling apart or is too nice, so you want to keep it looking nice.

46:14.200 --> 46:18.404
It may not warrant the constant expense of a handmade clamshell box.

46:19.265 --> 46:24.611
But the book itself will not go through any kind of... It's kind of the same.

46:24.791 --> 46:30.016
We clearly do decide what to work on and what not to work on.

46:30.157 --> 46:35.462
Most of that entirely is based on manpower and staffing.

46:35.695 --> 46:41.821
And the acknowledgment that item-by-item conservation is an incredibly expensive product.

46:42.201 --> 46:43.943
What the weeding number is here?

46:43.963 --> 46:45.184
Are you involved in that?

46:45.204 --> 46:46.926
No, I don't know.

46:46.946 --> 46:50.870
That is part of the whole Little Books preservation program.

46:50.890 --> 46:55.114
Whether it's all done in a focused manner, I don't know.

46:55.594 --> 47:05.584
I do know that many years ago under the previous administration, when we had this—was it the New York Public Library, I guess, was the organization?

47:05.868 --> 47:18.319
in either consulting on the Brittle-Brooks Books survey that we had done in the early 90s, like I said, or late 80s.

47:19.440 --> 47:34.153
We developed, as a result of all that information, a coherent, cohesive, scheduled Brittle-Brooks Identification and Replacement Program, took it to the director at that time,

47:34.859 --> 47:38.163
who just said, it's nice.

47:38.484 --> 47:45.674
And unfortunately, that was the management style here for many years.

47:46.555 --> 47:51.321
And new ideas are, as in those bureaucracies, new ideas are threatening.

47:51.662 --> 47:56.748
And there was a real sense that things would be too expensive.

47:56.909 --> 48:00.534
A lot of libraries have policies of one book in, one book out.

48:02.076 --> 48:03.498
I mean, you've probably heard of that.

48:03.598 --> 48:04.579
You know, it's...

48:05.099 --> 48:10.807
Even at Cornell, they've decided that there will never be more than 5 million books on campus.

48:10.827 --> 48:11.749
You know, they have 6.8.

48:11.789 --> 48:13.271
They do have off-site storage.

48:13.832 --> 48:17.717
But the trustees said no more space on campus for books.

48:17.917 --> 48:20.141
Well, I've actually somewhat related to that.

48:20.241 --> 48:26.790
I have heard that a 40% loss rate here, I bought it, is acceptable.

48:26.810 --> 48:30.375
Now, that could mean... You mean, we're talking about what?

48:31.397 --> 48:31.797
In general.

48:31.837 --> 48:32.679
Two libraries in general.

48:32.699 --> 48:35.022
That could mean...

48:35.052 --> 48:57.280
uh deaccessioning loss through embrittlement that accident i'm going to let you go back to work thank you so much this is excellent now well i'll be in touch good thanks a lot appreciate it bye-bye

51:15.314 --> 51:15.993
Thank you.

53:04.867 --> 53:10.050
Thank you.

53:33.588 --> 53:36.898
Thank you.

58:48.897 --> 58:49.173
Thank you.

01:02:52.859 --> 01:02:53.404
Thank you.
