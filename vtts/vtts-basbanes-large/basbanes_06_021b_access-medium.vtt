WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:10.913
I'll say it again, this was where it was used by... My partner, he dressed up in motor stick time, John, it was about knowing the books.

00:10.933 --> 00:19.091
But if you thought it was set up as an institution, the private library, he opened it to qualified scholars.

00:19.131 --> 00:22.579
He was way ahead of his time when Morgan was collecting...

00:22.897 --> 00:29.526
You know, and before he established this thing as a life, nobody had the slightest... Morgan was not that kind of collection.

00:30.027 --> 00:34.292
Morgan's concept of collecting... He had things he wouldn't let anybody see.

00:34.312 --> 00:36.095
They were not that kind of collection.

00:37.597 --> 00:41.822
Morgan, all Morgan wanted was jewels.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.066
Jewels.

00:45.147 --> 00:52.617
I mean, he didn't have a literary menu, but he wanted Emily Bronte's...

00:53.170 --> 00:55.157
Manuscripts.

00:55.659 --> 00:56.382
That's all he wants.

00:56.984 --> 01:00.617
He didn't want all the correspondence with the publisher or any of that stuff.

01:00.697 --> 01:03.568
He just wanted this manuscript.

01:03.588 --> 01:03.889
Sell it.

01:04.831 --> 01:09.760
He wanted something to put in the setting he admired.

01:09.981 --> 01:14.429
Disintended from its origins.

01:16.233 --> 01:19.840
And that's what the folks... Why did he give it to the state of New York?

01:19.860 --> 01:21.343
That's on Sunday.

01:21.363 --> 01:24.088
Well, he had to do something.

01:24.068 --> 01:29.738
But the point is, he didn't discuss it.

01:29.838 --> 01:39.816
No, no, because he was using a Dan Carter Brown model.

01:41.264 --> 01:44.748
But he wasn't just a jewel, I think, because they do support research.

01:45.489 --> 01:47.332
Oh, yes, you get enough jewels together.

01:47.352 --> 01:51.397
But again, it doesn't happen.

01:51.577 --> 01:53.159
Conceptual unity.

01:53.660 --> 01:57.304
Conceptual unity.

01:57.324 --> 02:01.930
Well, and then it kind of expanded to Elizabethan's.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.453
No, that was done under Louis Wright.

02:04.433 --> 02:09.005
When Louis Wright took over as a librarian, he was the one who expanded that.

02:09.085 --> 02:14.359
The program has become more like the John Carter Brown Library in that now it is a library that concentrates

02:14.693 --> 02:21.299
on a historical period and place.

02:21.319 --> 02:30.548
We don't even really even have a place in a way, because Folger's a great library for, you know, 16th, 17th, 18th century English history, so it evolved into that.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.690
It didn't begin that way.

02:31.850 --> 02:32.771
You began that way.

02:32.791 --> 02:36.554
We began with this conceptual... Somebody was inspired.

02:37.015 --> 02:39.397
I mean, there was really somebody who was inspired.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.359
There were serious teachers who were inspired.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.022
I'm really sorry.

02:43.482 --> 02:46.546
We still don't entirely understand.

02:46.707 --> 02:54.377
I've spent a lot of time studying it.

02:54.397 --> 02:59.243
It started with something instant that John Carter Brown had.

03:00.044 --> 03:02.387
And he shared that with John Muscle Father.

03:02.968 --> 03:04.410
And he also shared it

03:04.981 --> 03:09.326
with a number of booksellers, notably Henry Stevens.

03:09.346 --> 03:10.687
His name keeps coming up over there.

03:10.707 --> 03:12.169
Oh, yes, he wrote here.

03:12.449 --> 03:16.213
Mr. John Carter Brown was his first question.

03:16.233 --> 03:19.857
And the library Stevens, who built the Americana at the British Library.

03:20.218 --> 03:25.864
He was the one that was also sent to sell George Washington's library to the British Library.

03:25.884 --> 03:28.767
And then the Boston Athenaeum got people together.

03:29.007 --> 03:31.730
Well, he gave the Boston Athenaeum.

03:31.770 --> 03:34.093
He gave Americans an opportunity to buy it.

03:34.411 --> 03:47.632
But then, somehow or other, John Carter Brown, along with John Russell Brown, he was a fascinating person in his own right.

03:47.672 --> 03:54.883
He was one of the pioneers in publishing and getting people in the exploration of the Mayan Peninsula.

03:55.876 --> 04:01.764
he published Stevens' thing on the Yucatan.

04:01.784 --> 04:12.879
Compare for me, because there were contemporaries and there were rivals, Brown and Lennox, and what Lennox didn't... Lennox was a publisher.

04:12.919 --> 04:18.947
But there were certainly rivals, they went after... Well, there were rivals of collectors, but no one could get in to see Lennox's books.

04:20.429 --> 04:30.459
He built this wing onto his house, a fireproof wing.

04:30.539 --> 04:32.922
After 1874?

04:33.002 --> 04:47.196
After he got married, his wife... But I'm sure she was... She said, look, she was fascinated by the... She is... But he built this wing on, and...

04:48.442 --> 04:51.326
made it available to selected scholars.

04:51.726 --> 04:55.491
And in 1865, they published a catalog on it.

04:55.631 --> 05:03.421
I think it was not the first bibliographical record of what constitutes a mark on it.

05:03.541 --> 05:07.706
It's a point of departure for the subject.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.589
I'll tell you about catalog, Mr. Barlet et al.

05:09.609 --> 05:13.794
It's just a beautiful work, and there's a tremendous amount of research.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.835
Where did you find Barlet?

05:14.895 --> 05:16.097
Did Barlet find him?

05:16.157 --> 05:17.959
Barlet was a providence.

05:18.158 --> 05:30.352
with Warren Provinson moved to South Canada, came back, he opened a bookstore in New York City, and he opened a bookstore in New York City, and it has some connection from the beginning of Squidward.

05:30.553 --> 05:41.526
And he knew Edgar Allan Poe, and it was sort of a meeting.

05:42.006 --> 05:47.052
And he got persuaded the President of the United States

05:47.403 --> 06:03.680
to make... he was a polymath, he was interested in... he was interested in early Norse discoveries, he was interested in the early Americas, I mean the Indians and Central Americans.

06:03.700 --> 06:04.602
Yeah.

06:05.172 --> 06:09.617
Well, there's a very good biography that we have.

06:09.857 --> 06:17.025
It's a doctoral dissertation that John Haskell... Well, it doesn't go... It's about its whole life.

06:17.266 --> 06:21.250
No, no, no, no, but... We'll have to look at the eulogies.

06:21.290 --> 06:25.956
I'm sure if I can't find stuff in the library, I'll know a lot of my stuff, I'll come back.

06:25.976 --> 06:28.058
The most fascinating thing is that...

06:28.038 --> 06:36.128
He got this job, he was chief of the commission that ran the boundary line between Mexico and the United States after the Mexican-American War.

06:36.909 --> 06:46.841
So he spent two or three years surveying the boundary line that established Utah and Arizona and all this.

06:47.502 --> 06:53.229
And I made a mistake when I had to go out and make me down with the principal of interest.

06:53.249 --> 06:55.311
Someone was telling me recently that he didn't

06:55.612 --> 06:56.694
He was also an artist.

06:57.836 --> 07:07.957
In the same sense of any cultivated man in those days, we had a draw because there were no... So we have a book called Bartlett's Glory, published by one of the most.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.239
The best we have is we have the drawings.

07:11.484 --> 07:14.650
That, I think, was the foundation of his...

07:14.883 --> 07:33.381
very serious knowledge about history and more people about it but then when that was over he came back and became secretary of state and go back now that was about a you know about 10 of your time

07:34.407 --> 07:39.637
But he actually was the first person to collect and publish the archives of Rhode Island.

07:39.898 --> 07:40.238
Oh, yes.

07:40.318 --> 07:44.968
He collected Roger Williams' paper and everything.

07:45.048 --> 07:53.224
But he also then became John Tyler Brown's unofficial librarian, and it was very interesting.

07:53.244 --> 07:56.550
So the two of them worked very closely together.

07:56.767 --> 08:03.674
John Calder Brown didn't get married in the 60s years old.

08:03.755 --> 08:04.896
I didn't know that.

08:04.996 --> 08:05.456
Yeah.

08:05.476 --> 08:06.317
Fascinating.

08:07.619 --> 08:10.822
I think his wife, Sophia, proceeded.

08:10.842 --> 08:12.644
What was the source of their income?

08:12.664 --> 08:13.305
Their fortune?

08:13.325 --> 08:14.186
Their fortune?

08:14.226 --> 08:17.429
The Browns were the first American entrepreneur.

08:17.449 --> 08:18.991
They started in the shipping.

08:19.111 --> 08:24.837
And whenever a new profitable industry raised its head, they moved their money into that.

08:24.857 --> 08:26.419
They moved their shipping into taxes.

08:26.990 --> 08:38.065
They were the first Americans who used money to make money.

08:38.085 --> 08:46.836
The basis of their fortune was shipping, but they used the profits from that to get in the textile.

08:46.876 --> 08:49.099
They pioneered in bringing the textile business.

08:49.568 --> 08:53.812
In this country, they brought Samuel Slater over.

08:53.832 --> 08:57.035
Were they involved in the slave trade at all?

08:57.055 --> 08:58.697
I've heard that suggested.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.540
It's a clear question.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.482
No, it's a clear question.

09:04.522 --> 09:06.724
Well, then we should address it and answer it.

09:06.744 --> 09:06.844
Yeah.

09:09.527 --> 09:11.088
There were four Brown brothers.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.552
Actually, five.

09:14.672 --> 09:17.955
The oldest one died at sea when he was a young man.

09:18.610 --> 09:19.772
The elders was Nicholas.

09:21.655 --> 09:22.897
The second one was John.

09:22.917 --> 09:29.687
The third one, I think, was Moses, and the fourth was James.

09:29.708 --> 09:36.238
And they, together, formed at this first, the shipping movement.

09:36.258 --> 09:39.944
And years gone by, they separated.

09:39.964 --> 09:42.087
Now, we...

09:42.725 --> 10:02.657
He was a very powerful guy, and he made and lost to his retortions.

10:03.245 --> 10:06.570
And he built this house here.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.713
The brick house is called the John Brown House.

10:08.874 --> 10:12.299
It's very interesting.

10:12.399 --> 10:13.380
He built that.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.605
It was the biggest mansion in Port Valley.

10:16.625 --> 10:28.223
His brother, older brother Nicholas, who was more fruity, a bit more modest until a high fryer named Nightingale, who had built the big gray house.

10:28.523 --> 10:37.940
and now where we used to be going, got into financial trouble, and Nicholas picked it up cheap.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.747
So he had his big house, but he didn't put all that money in it.

10:41.767 --> 10:48.158
Anyway, John did get into the slave trade.

10:48.619 --> 10:53.147
He did, along with people in Bristol.

10:54.427 --> 10:57.331
I'm not self-righteous.

10:57.852 --> 11:07.305
There's no question that John Brown was deeply involved in the slave trade.

11:08.086 --> 11:11.291
As were a lot of other Bristol families.

11:11.311 --> 11:12.433
The Wolves and the Howes.

11:12.533 --> 11:23.168
Nicholas Howard sent out two slaving voyages.

11:23.317 --> 11:48.413
lost money on both and never did it again.

11:48.393 --> 11:53.303
I may spend one or two sentences on this in my book.

11:53.383 --> 11:59.435
It was a rarity in the 18th century for any merchant not to dabble in the same trade.

11:59.455 --> 12:00.276
They could make money.

12:00.337 --> 12:01.098
And he did dabble.

12:01.118 --> 12:02.621
He lost money and didn't do what he did.

12:02.641 --> 12:06.148
Unless you happened to be a Quaker or a few other groups that were...

12:06.685 --> 12:10.391
By the 19th century, it became, you know, much more slavery.

12:10.431 --> 12:13.896
He didn't stay out of it because it wasn't possible.

12:13.956 --> 12:25.455
John Carter Brown, who started the library, was an opponent of slavery and belonged to... That's very important.

12:25.575 --> 12:25.955
Oh, yeah.

12:26.015 --> 12:28.660
I mean, he was, in fact, the leading opponent.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.444
He belonged to this group that...

12:31.677 --> 12:39.409
what it was called that sent anti-slavers out to Kansas, Nebraska to increase the population of anti-slavers.

12:40.371 --> 12:41.973
Ignore it.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.898
He was an opponent?

12:44.938 --> 12:45.258
Yes.

12:45.278 --> 12:48.744
He is not responsible for it.

12:48.884 --> 12:51.308
It's not relevant to what you're saying.

12:51.328 --> 12:54.192
Occasionally a black student does something about it and says,

12:54.796 --> 13:11.992
This library is built on money that was earned by... I mean, you're... The family made the fortune from oil oil and iron mills and touchdown mills and not from slavery.

13:12.272 --> 13:20.720
I could also... When the Civil War was over, all these soldiers were given Western lands and they weren't going to move out there.

13:21.081 --> 13:23.503
So the grounds brought up.

13:24.007 --> 13:27.430
They own five or six counties in Iowa today.

13:28.451 --> 13:31.473
There's still members of the Brown family around?

13:31.874 --> 13:33.395
Oh, good heavens.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.697
He's a great grandson of our Board of Governors.

13:35.737 --> 13:37.298
He's a director, but also value it all.

13:38.179 --> 13:39.780
And the director of the... Which Brown is he?

13:39.800 --> 13:40.781
Jay Carter Brown.

13:40.801 --> 13:41.422
Jay Carter Brown.

13:41.802 --> 13:43.664
He's got the profile of New Yorker this week.

13:43.684 --> 13:45.665
That's right.

13:45.685 --> 13:47.387
Well, I know who Jay Carter is.

13:48.108 --> 13:51.130
I did not realize he was a director of the Browns.

13:51.791 --> 13:53.372
Well, we have a series of books.

13:54.078 --> 14:22.448
And then there's another book that John Nick gave us when he was 11.

14:22.917 --> 14:32.457
And Carter's son, the director of the National Gallery of Art, who's just now 12, and last year he was 11.

14:32.978 --> 14:42.057
So we had this original ceremony where Jay became his father and his grandfather and gave the library a book.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.674
Do they go quite a place, these books, in the last time?

14:46.714 --> 14:51.379
No, they're just on the shelf, but they're nicely boxed.

14:51.419 --> 14:56.064
The library's really an extraordinary library.

14:56.085 --> 14:59.929
You see, he was beginning to understand it, didn't he?

14:59.989 --> 15:01.050
No, no, I didn't.

15:01.070 --> 15:03.893
I'll go off for a second.

15:03.933 --> 15:06.336
You said Bill Scheidt is using you as vice president.

15:06.356 --> 15:09.900
Yeah, it's going to be part of the priesthood, but not a part of the priesthood library.

15:10.471 --> 15:12.354
I think that's got to be it, doesn't it?

15:12.374 --> 15:14.337
Yeah, because we're the models of this.

15:14.457 --> 15:16.380
We were the first people.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.684
You know, the Folgers owned by Amherst, Amherst.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.108
It's sort of similar.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.670
Which caught them totally by surprise.

15:22.690 --> 15:23.392
I was just meeting.

15:23.772 --> 15:24.173
Oh, yes.

15:24.393 --> 15:28.640
I mean, they had a meeting going one day and somebody said, you have no idea what just happened.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.444
I mean, he documented and said, we've got it.

15:31.524 --> 15:35.010
I mean, they had no idea that they were getting in until we got it.

15:36.053 --> 15:54.400
but so i mean jay carter brown is on the board of governors of the library yeah he's not he's not he's not a book collector but he's a collector no his father was not his mother was a great book collector than his father no it's not something that's not i mean the family is sort of

15:55.038 --> 16:00.753
who added more to a dark collector.

16:00.914 --> 16:08.214
His grandfather, who made the library, was trained to be a book collector.

16:08.996 --> 16:11.342
John Russell Baldwin really was the

16:12.014 --> 16:19.521
So the sponsor of these two boys, John Nicholas Brown and Harold Brown, John Russell Crawford, after this, they're a mentor in book collecting.

16:20.182 --> 16:21.864
They travel all over Europe.

16:22.184 --> 16:23.626
Would the J.C.

16:23.746 --> 16:28.711
Brown Library be different if it were a product of Brown University in Canada?

16:28.731 --> 16:30.733
It would be absorbed and it would disappear.

16:31.513 --> 16:35.017
It would be like the Lennox Library is at the New York Public Library.

16:35.958 --> 16:40.182
I mean, there was a library that was comparable.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.165
And it was a separate library.

16:43.185 --> 16:46.272
It was set up as a separate library in New York.

16:47.154 --> 16:58.339
And then along came Mr. Children with his money and taught the trustees of the Master Library and the Lennox Library merging.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.665
to build the New York Public Library.

17:01.685 --> 17:03.327
You know, this goes across the top.

17:03.407 --> 17:04.909
It's three families, basically.

17:04.949 --> 17:09.354
Well, the two of them, Lennox and Astor are books, taking them some money.

17:09.674 --> 17:11.336
And then they were absorbed into that.

17:12.077 --> 17:13.459
They created a great library.

17:13.559 --> 17:18.225
But you go and look at the condition of some of the Lennox books, and they're shocking.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.409
Because they were all mixed up.

17:21.589 --> 17:28.798
Now, I don't mean to be too sentimental here, but do you think that the spirit of the founders still

17:29.774 --> 17:30.675
Here?

17:30.695 --> 17:30.975
There?

17:31.236 --> 17:31.897
There or here?

17:31.917 --> 17:32.017
Here.

17:32.037 --> 17:33.058
Of course.

17:33.078 --> 17:34.940
Well, I spent 25 years there.

17:34.960 --> 17:38.905
After all, the spirit of that that was passed on to a man named Minkia.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.988
His taste, his focus, his interest, his mandate.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.730
The Browns.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.052
You live with this.

17:44.072 --> 17:47.195
Well, now they're puncturing nearly as envisageable.

17:47.216 --> 17:51.521
I'm talking about, you know what I'm saying, it's a sentimental kind of a question.

17:51.541 --> 17:57.368
If anything, the Columbus quintessential is coming up in just two years, you know, so

17:58.141 --> 18:02.307
I wrote something saying that the library has waited for 100 years for the Columbus King Centenary.

18:03.129 --> 18:03.389
What?

18:03.509 --> 18:09.498
I don't remember now, but it's just that I'll give you something.

18:13.925 --> 18:23.519
John Carter Brown understood that the European discovery of Morocco was the greatest secular event in human history, which it is.

18:23.599 --> 18:27.405
I mean, there is nothing comparable to it.

18:27.875 --> 18:28.776
And never will be.

18:28.796 --> 18:30.999
There was only one time can the world be united.

18:31.019 --> 18:33.221
It was two totally separate worlds.

18:33.281 --> 18:35.244
Neither half of the other existed.

18:36.445 --> 18:44.214
And one moment, October 12, 1492, they were permanently linked.

18:44.314 --> 18:45.476
And that transformed the world.

18:45.536 --> 18:50.942
And so the beginning of the modern world relates to the discovery of America.

18:50.962 --> 18:53.545
Now, do you think the fact that the family's fortune

18:53.862 --> 19:02.333
was based on shipping and traveling and anything to do with collecting interest?

19:02.673 --> 19:03.775
Well, it has.

19:05.016 --> 19:11.965
Most of what happened, much of what happened, happened on the sea.

19:11.985 --> 19:20.376
I mean, you know, so the whole maritime dimension was always fascinating to the extent that

19:20.693 --> 19:26.642
In the early days, John Carter Brown was collecting maritime books.

19:26.662 --> 19:28.605
This was a logical progression.

19:28.905 --> 19:36.377
And then that built and built the maritime collections.

19:37.378 --> 19:40.903
Well, I came along and said, anything that's maritime is Americana.

19:40.924 --> 19:42.065
Anything, anything.

19:42.085 --> 19:44.008
Not that it relates to the Atlantic Ocean.

19:44.028 --> 19:45.250
No, the oceans of the world.

19:45.432 --> 19:47.576
Well, we don't collect our travel in America.

19:48.137 --> 19:50.823
We've got... I wouldn't.

19:50.843 --> 19:53.087
Well, I certainly wouldn't if I couldn't have gotten it.

19:53.107 --> 19:54.250
But we've got some of the best.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.612
This is great.

19:55.632 --> 19:57.436
I mean, you know, it's a discussion.

19:57.456 --> 20:00.963
There's nothing of all about... Well, because they also have more about Portuguese.

20:01.043 --> 20:04.470
All right, so you see, that's the way they would grow it.

20:04.720 --> 20:09.388
We move from what... We don't take quantum jumps in our group.

20:09.408 --> 20:12.793
We move like a series of concentric circles.

20:13.154 --> 20:16.058
We start in and go up to the next circle.

20:16.098 --> 20:20.425
We find that that circle, it relaxes some circles and then go up to the next circle.

20:20.445 --> 20:24.372
And then it gets bigger and it gets bigger, but it doesn't get a quantum jump.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.956
But it embraces every circle as it goes.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.762
But one of the results is that we have our collection, our own material,

20:31.298 --> 20:35.318
And the early exploration of the Far East is one of the best in the country.

20:35.787 --> 20:39.232
To compete with the Essex Institute on that at all?

20:39.252 --> 20:42.757
No, no, that's technology and that's a local historical society.

20:42.777 --> 20:46.803
No, but you know, the great competitor... Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good.

20:47.003 --> 20:49.907
Pretty good local historical society.

20:50.008 --> 20:51.049
Oh, yeah.

20:51.129 --> 20:52.611
And along with the old guy.

20:52.631 --> 20:55.435
The great competitor would be the James Ford Dahl Library of Minnesota.

20:55.496 --> 20:56.377
Do you know about that?

20:56.397 --> 20:58.079
James Ford Dahl?

20:58.420 --> 21:02.986
Well... Which is a collection of books related to European expansion.

21:04.529 --> 21:05.490
But we...

21:06.010 --> 21:14.540
We understood tremendous interest in European expansion, but that which is focused on America, not, for example, European expansion to China and Japan and things like that.

21:14.620 --> 21:23.231
Unless it's, I mean, we have a lot of material related to that because the Portuguese went to Brazil, they also went to Goa, and they also went to Macau and so on.

21:23.251 --> 21:31.181
So once you collect Portuguese materials... Are you looking for anything in particular?

21:31.881 --> 21:35.646
Are there targets of opportunity or things that just...

21:36.605 --> 21:40.792
Do you have an active acquisition program, I guess, is the first time I ask.

21:41.313 --> 21:41.613
Oh, yeah.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.635
I buy all the time.

21:42.655 --> 21:45.299
But I mean, are you looking for gaps in the same way?

21:45.319 --> 21:48.284
No, you've got a misconception here.

21:48.304 --> 21:48.684
Gaps.

21:49.686 --> 21:52.310
Gaps implies collecting by the book.

21:52.971 --> 21:55.455
It's like a stamp album.

21:55.636 --> 21:57.338
And you want to build it.

21:58.961 --> 22:00.824
Because you know what exists already.

22:00.844 --> 22:01.465
And so you want to build it.

22:01.630 --> 22:02.611
We don't collect that.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.093
We create the stamp album.

22:06.176 --> 22:07.598
So you don't know what it is until you see it.

22:08.059 --> 22:10.522
And when you see it, you don't know if it exists until you see it.

22:10.542 --> 22:15.088
Give me an example of something that you never knew existed before, if you can.

22:15.108 --> 22:15.949
Well, let's see.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.753
But as soon as you saw it, you knew it was wonderful.

22:18.913 --> 22:19.594
You had to have it.

22:19.654 --> 22:23.259
You know, Tom did the definitive bibliography of American Revolutionary Interference.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.083
I could show it to you.

22:26.123 --> 22:27.925
It's a novel of two-volume work.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.022
from 1763 to 1784.

22:30.423 --> 22:35.369
And so how many years did you spend on that?

22:37.773 --> 22:44.682
So somebody mailed us today, I just showed a third foot, which is Latin and Adams, this American country.

22:44.742 --> 22:51.992
So here's the Spanish people of the well-known deaths.

22:52.733 --> 22:57.439
But you see that a lot of collectors

22:58.837 --> 23:23.173
are people who really are slavishly following the colonial 100 as an example that's an example that's the way uh uh what's his name dave brandon sold himself to mr william that's right that's exactly right and uh

23:23.727 --> 23:36.989
And a lot of other collectors, and they will, you know, and then with the right kind of PR, they get a lot of kudos for this, become distinguished collectors.

23:37.009 --> 23:41.797
All they're doing is doing pale imitations that has already been done.

23:41.817 --> 23:43.339
Anyone who collects Americana,

23:44.602 --> 23:46.485
is a pale imitation of us.

23:46.505 --> 23:48.689
That's why Mr. Clements went off into the manuscripts.

23:48.729 --> 23:50.412
He knew we couldn't achieve it.

23:50.432 --> 23:58.766
That's why Tom Street in there realizes there's no point in his taking a great collection of establishing a library.

23:58.787 --> 23:59.949
It's very interesting.

23:59.989 --> 24:01.692
Did you get some Street of Things?

24:01.712 --> 24:03.675
You got everything you wanted.

24:03.695 --> 24:05.077
Yeah, you asked him pretty well.

24:05.258 --> 24:07.962
Yeah, well, we got everything you wanted.

24:08.002 --> 24:09.625
Your first lap, I thought.

24:09.725 --> 24:10.086
No, no.

24:10.319 --> 24:12.942
It was two years of stress.

24:13.182 --> 24:15.545
It was giving me on my price.

24:16.045 --> 24:25.216
I took two things right out from under Counts Krause's nose by tangling something that he went off after.

24:25.236 --> 24:26.718
Completely go, but I really wanted to.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.299
Counts Krause is selling now.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.143
Well, his daughter is whatever.

24:31.323 --> 24:33.645
A Columbus letter from the Swedish sale.

24:34.366 --> 24:36.008
A Rome, $14 million.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.710
Oh, that was a common letter.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.478
$650,000.

24:38.538 --> 24:43.164
I was thinking at auction it would draw more than that.

24:43.184 --> 24:45.026
$650,000 is not bad.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.449
It's a depressed economy like that.

24:47.609 --> 24:50.212
No, but you see, the JCB is what?

24:50.893 --> 24:54.177
Now, there are other collectors of the same sort.

24:55.179 --> 24:59.925
There's a collection right here on this campus, over in the John Hale Library.

24:59.945 --> 25:05.892
It was formed by a man named Albert Loundes, who were Albert Loundes.

25:06.935 --> 25:08.737
L-O-U-N-D-E-S.

25:08.737 --> 25:37.141
Al Loundes was a boy scout when he a small child. Growing up, he would play the violin. He's a local boy. He got fascinated by books and he began collecting. And he was interested first of all in the history of biology.

25:37.141 --> 25:40.409
And that expanded to all of natural science.

25:41.612 --> 25:46.264
And he was buying these books before the history of science was a passion of beliefs.

25:49.512 --> 25:50.515
He knew the books.

25:50.535 --> 25:53.783
He understood what was in them.

25:53.948 --> 26:04.694
Here at Brown University, there is a very fine collection on the history of mathematics, and a pretty good collection on the history of physical sciences.

26:06.017 --> 26:10.708
So Al Lau spent his entire life building this collection.

26:11.650 --> 26:27.193
And then when he died, his collection came.

26:27.874 --> 26:31.720
But this was a collection in his own right was a remarkable collection.

26:31.740 --> 26:32.882
But he was collecting it.

26:32.902 --> 26:34.564
He didn't have any guidelines.

26:34.584 --> 26:38.350
He didn't have any one hundred and one hundred and

26:38.600 --> 26:41.804
the book's famous in science that was published.

26:41.824 --> 26:43.807
He develops.

26:44.447 --> 26:47.852
He owns all but about five books left.

26:48.292 --> 26:53.899
Harrison Horville used his collection when he did that thing.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.402
And there are any number of other collectors.

26:57.644 --> 27:06.615
I'm writing a review right now of a catalog of early navigation books.

27:06.983 --> 27:08.946
collected by a Dutchman named Crone.

27:10.247 --> 27:13.391
And he started collecting as a young man, history navigation.

27:14.873 --> 27:18.198
No one was buying that stuff.

27:18.218 --> 27:19.820
You open it, and there's no text.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.623
They're all papers.

27:22.643 --> 27:26.428
Absolutely crucial, the same improvisation.

27:26.468 --> 27:33.177
Crone built this collection, saved it during the war, during the German occupation, which is an exciting story in itself.

27:33.950 --> 27:40.180
Then, in the end, he turned it over to the Sipart Museum, which is the great Dutch maritime museum library.

27:40.981 --> 27:42.503
But he was collecting for that.

27:42.524 --> 27:43.785
Is this a catalogue of that?

27:43.806 --> 27:43.946
Yeah.

27:43.966 --> 27:47.051
Who publishes it?

27:47.652 --> 27:48.773
Well, the museum.

27:49.154 --> 27:51.498
Who are you reviewing it for?

27:51.518 --> 27:52.720
The book collection, the Nichols Institute.

27:52.740 --> 27:53.741
Oh, you were doing it for Nichols.

27:54.562 --> 27:59.991
Here's another example of that.

28:00.106 --> 28:05.175
Here's another example of a really great collection.

28:05.355 --> 28:07.719
I've already mentioned the collections in the collection of Texas.

28:08.660 --> 28:16.213
And that's the Latin American collection, formed not by a private collection, but by a canned-hankers Yankee from Texas named Minnie Netanyahu Benson.

28:17.095 --> 28:19.178
The Latin American collection is recognized.

28:19.647 --> 28:36.070
as the greatest collection of latin americans in the world uh not for early material well well not for one but but still from they're very strong they're strong in the early in the early they're strong in the early but but

28:36.050 --> 28:41.014
But for the 19th, for the national period of all Latin American countries.

28:41.034 --> 28:43.897
We have the largest, Latin American, the largest, J.C.

28:43.957 --> 28:44.237
Browns.

28:45.458 --> 28:57.689
But, but, but, but, but, but, yeah, they've got good early stuff, not quite as good as that, but for the 19th century, no Latin American country has been comparable.

28:57.749 --> 29:04.875
Maybe Mexico could do quite as, you know, even Mexico, Mexico can't touch what it has on Peru, Bolivia,

29:04.855 --> 29:07.638
anyone studying Latin.

29:08.279 --> 29:12.303
And Harry Rancho and the rest of the people in Texas ignored them.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.406
There was a great collection.

29:14.987 --> 29:24.678
So this is what I mean about collections that are on the cutting edge of them.

29:25.198 --> 29:28.602
We started to talk about, just to go back about an hour or something,

29:29.020 --> 29:31.383
We're talking about these book collecting prizes for students.

29:31.443 --> 29:32.004
Yes.

29:32.024 --> 29:38.472
You know, you mentioned the Yale Prize, the Bancindering Prize, which Bill Reese won, you know, when he was an undergraduate.

29:38.853 --> 29:40.174
And also Graham Arena won.

29:40.835 --> 29:41.857
Graham Arena.

29:41.877 --> 29:48.525
So these two prominent dealers both won the undergraduate book collecting prize at Yale.

29:48.545 --> 29:52.210
One respectable, the other...

29:52.392 --> 29:53.594
I'm not writing about Graham.

29:53.634 --> 29:54.255
He's been done.

29:54.515 --> 29:55.577
Yeah.

29:55.697 --> 29:57.339
I don't mean it anymore.

29:57.359 --> 29:58.200
It's been done, I mean.

29:58.240 --> 30:04.429
But I think these book-collecting parts of undergraduates, there's one of Cornell's, although they are, they're confirming.

30:05.050 --> 30:07.193
There's a good one in Virginia.

30:07.213 --> 30:11.319
Undergraduate has an interest in... Virginia has one?

30:11.339 --> 30:11.480
Yeah.

30:11.620 --> 30:12.501
Cornell as well, I'm sorry?

30:12.521 --> 30:13.202
Cornell has one.

30:13.463 --> 30:20.853
Because when we first got ours going, we wrote to a lot of different institutions to get an idea of their rules and guidelines and things.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.095
And the undergraduates, I think it's

30:22.312 --> 30:25.619
If you win, it solidifies something.

30:25.759 --> 30:31.391
It's a little bit vague, and suddenly you identify it as someone who is a collector.

30:31.411 --> 30:35.960
I wonder why an institution has such a character.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.545
Why colleges do that?

30:38.585 --> 30:43.375
Who do you think of Bill Jackson's principal supporter?

30:43.642 --> 30:45.526
the men who took Winship's course.

30:50.095 --> 30:56.447
George Parker Winship gave a course, specifically aimed wealthy young men.

30:57.910 --> 31:00.856
And many of them turned into be collected after a whole group.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.078
Really?

31:02.479 --> 31:05.565
Was it Winship's course also?

31:05.798 --> 31:07.000
What was the name of this question?

31:07.060 --> 31:10.687
I mean, was it a bibliography?

31:10.807 --> 31:15.496
No, it actually was in finance.

31:15.897 --> 31:23.250
But was it the focus on collecting and preservation of objects?

31:23.551 --> 31:25.694
What's the name of the most famous department store in Texas?

31:27.356 --> 31:27.816
Neiman Marcus.

31:27.876 --> 31:28.637
Neiman Marcus.

31:28.677 --> 31:29.398
Stanley Marcus.

31:29.418 --> 31:30.159
He was 80 years old.

31:30.199 --> 31:31.160
He collected miniatures.

31:31.180 --> 31:31.481
That's right.

31:31.501 --> 31:34.945
Stanley Marcus was also a student of George Parker Winship's at Harvard.

31:34.965 --> 31:40.712
He once told me that he first heard about the John Carter Bell Library, and he was his undergraduate at Harvard.

31:41.212 --> 31:42.754
I took George Parker Winship's course.

31:42.794 --> 31:43.875
He told you this is Marcus?

31:43.895 --> 31:44.716
Marcus, yeah.

31:45.838 --> 31:46.418
I didn't know him.

31:46.439 --> 31:48.121
Is he related to me?

31:48.201 --> 31:53.287
No, just that, you know, when you're out trying to find books and money, you try to meet as many collectors as you can.

31:53.327 --> 31:53.507
But

31:53.943 --> 32:06.580
Marcus said that George Parker Winsport talked all the time about the Johnny Connick Library, where he had been for half his career before he went to Harvard, so he, uh, Winship's career was hit.

32:06.600 --> 32:11.066
So you really think there's a little vile involved to get these wealthy young men?

32:11.086 --> 32:14.871
Winship was all vile!

32:14.851 --> 32:15.812
That's delightful.

32:16.473 --> 32:18.395
But also there was some at Yale.

32:18.415 --> 32:18.815
Wasn't it?

32:18.835 --> 32:19.836
Was it in the course?

32:19.896 --> 32:21.398
Who taught the course at Yale?

32:21.819 --> 32:44.503
The rare books at Yale are a whole generation behind Harvard. He went there in 1914.

32:44.905 --> 32:47.869
left here and went back to Harvard in 14.

32:47.889 --> 32:51.233
And his, for 10 years, he developed this.

32:51.813 --> 33:00.143
Tinker didn't start his coterie of young students who gathered around him until 15 or 20 years later.

33:00.984 --> 33:06.330
So Yale's always been a whole generation behind Harvard.

33:08.733 --> 33:13.259
Because they didn't have a book collection until the Sterling was built.

33:13.279 --> 33:14.440
They were just in the closet.

33:14.622 --> 33:19.009
He's very interested in it.

33:19.389 --> 33:23.336
I'm going to spend a lot of time in Yale.

33:23.756 --> 33:26.921
Yeah, but what Bill doesn't know is he's too young.

33:26.981 --> 33:30.006
Yeah, I think you've made a point, though.

33:30.086 --> 33:35.635
Well, I know, but so, there's a famous, there was a wonderful librarian there,

33:36.205 --> 33:37.166
Andrew Kehoe.

33:38.348 --> 33:40.371
What's his name, Andrew Kehoe?

33:40.391 --> 33:40.972
Andrew Kehoe.

33:40.992 --> 33:44.878
A wonderful statement he made when they opened the Stirling Library.

33:45.459 --> 33:46.380
He was a Scotsman.

33:47.221 --> 33:48.103
He never went to college.

33:48.123 --> 33:54.552
And in an elaborate ceremony in front of his cathedral,

33:54.937 --> 34:02.993
He said, gentlemen, your library is inside.

34:03.053 --> 34:05.457
We have to close today at 2.30.

34:05.758 --> 34:07.441
Because they're turning off the power in our building.

34:07.842 --> 34:10.026
One last time, they're turning off the power in our building.

34:10.495 --> 34:13.518
to correct some poorly done .

34:13.618 --> 34:16.421
I want to show you two things.

34:16.441 --> 34:17.922
I wanted to see some more of these.

34:17.942 --> 34:19.764
Can I give you a call if I have any other questions?

34:19.844 --> 34:23.948
Yeah, but let me give you two things that I've written that I think you want to read.

34:23.968 --> 34:24.589
Yes.

34:24.609 --> 34:29.113
One is that thing called Librarians and Enemies of Books with two question marks.

34:29.133 --> 34:36.741
And it appeared in the College of Research Libraries about 10 years ago.

34:36.761 --> 34:38.022
And the other thing is called

34:38.322 --> 34:42.933
Biblioteca Americana, A Merry Maze of Changing Concepts.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.639
Can we have copies of these?

34:45.819 --> 34:51.132
And that appeared in the papers of the Bibliographical Society of America.

34:51.152 --> 34:52.395
20.

34:52.415 --> 34:56.905
It was really a text in America.

34:57.374 --> 35:00.038
That's where I come.

35:00.358 --> 35:04.604
Trace the history of collecting it all about.

35:05.165 --> 35:08.089
Do you have it offered?

35:08.169 --> 35:10.373
I can get the stuff at Harvard.

35:10.453 --> 35:13.938
I'm going to do it on a regular basis now.

35:14.018 --> 35:17.283
I'm yet to be disappointed.

35:17.323 --> 35:21.829
There are various enemies of books.

35:22.450 --> 35:41.183
is an analysis of what, how, how the structure of rare book operations has emerged between 1936 when Dad wrote that and what, and the way, and now what we are living with today.

35:43.147 --> 35:46.753
That was published at College and Research Library, that's the, um,

35:47.155 --> 35:57.731
It's a publication of the American Association of College of Research Libraries.

35:57.791 --> 36:03.199
That came out in the early 80s.

36:05.022 --> 36:07.706
And you read my thing on Hopper?

36:10.911 --> 36:10.991
Yes.

36:11.011 --> 36:13.295
I also did a thing on Winship.

36:13.375 --> 36:15.458
It was never published.

36:15.522 --> 36:38.020
his years here in providence uh if we get together again can i have your phone number yeah all right well i know i won't i would say a substantial proportion of the members of the roller club are members of snobbish reasons that's a fair statement they are not serious

36:38.995 --> 36:39.776
There are a few.

36:39.876 --> 36:47.042
There's Lady Eccles, and there's... There are some... In the history of the club, there have been major collectors.

36:47.082 --> 37:01.655
I would say almost all of the people who've been president and officers aren't being, but for a lot of people, it was simply another social... Well, yeah, well, I mean, booksellers and guys... They use it for... They use it for contacts.

37:01.675 --> 37:06.018
That's why I don't even think of a club, but it's an institution now.

37:06.038 --> 37:08.040
More than I've done it, it's a club.

37:09.151 --> 37:13.977
But you can go through the major figures.

37:14.458 --> 37:15.940
People perform major collections.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.381
We never remember him.

37:18.042 --> 37:20.686
Harry Dean was out there.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.547
Harry?

37:22.208 --> 37:22.608
Harry.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.790
He was a Philadelphia.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.171
He ran a seed company.

37:25.191 --> 37:26.353
He hadn't spelled that?

37:27.114 --> 37:28.075
He was.

37:28.195 --> 37:29.657
He was on the clock.

37:29.677 --> 37:30.738
He ran a seed company.

37:30.758 --> 37:32.841
One of the greatest collections of early Italian maps.

37:33.722 --> 37:34.804
And we got only enough.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.706
So how long were you here?

37:36.726 --> 37:37.347
25 years.

37:37.767 --> 37:38.348
From Wonderland.

37:38.682 --> 37:40.705
57 to 80-something years.

37:40.945 --> 37:43.409
And you're so private.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.250
No question.

37:45.432 --> 37:49.158
Stay out of your ticket.

37:49.178 --> 37:49.678
So I came.

37:49.818 --> 37:54.305
I didn't get into the librarian's office for seven years.

37:54.325 --> 37:55.247
My predecessor wouldn't leave.

37:55.267 --> 37:57.951
I'm not going to do that anymore.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.593
When I went down to see Ed Wolfe, he's there.

38:00.014 --> 38:01.836
He's still a presence there.

38:02.157 --> 38:05.702
And it's hard for John because I was running there.

38:06.155 --> 38:13.202
Let me give you an example of why William A. Jackson was a really great collector, in addition to being a great rare book librarian.

38:14.584 --> 38:26.516
I don't know if it's still there, but there was at one time, Bill, when he started the Hosenweiser, he began collecting all of the pulp science fiction magazines.

38:26.536 --> 38:30.420
You know, he's doing that now, Victor Burch.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.981
You know Victor from Brandeis?

38:32.302 --> 38:34.744
Well, maybe, but Bill saw this in 1915.

38:35.416 --> 38:40.543
That's an important field.

38:40.563 --> 38:44.048
It didn't cost him anything.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.211
He showed it to me.

38:46.251 --> 38:47.353
It was in the locker room.

38:47.433 --> 38:49.295
I don't thought any body was there.

38:49.315 --> 38:51.578
Do you think he liked science fiction?

38:51.639 --> 38:56.806
He just recognized the importance of this body of literature.

38:56.826 --> 39:01.753
And the fact that it was pulpit was probably going to be this great.

39:02.093 --> 39:03.215
It wasn't going to last.

39:03.255 --> 39:04.917
The fact that this was appearing.

39:05.690 --> 39:15.905
It's vitally important to mention to the 20th century literary and intellectual.

39:15.965 --> 39:19.730
It's a whole sign of cultural as much as anything, too, because it is a cultural phenomenon.

39:19.790 --> 39:28.663
You know, Bill Jackson, who was a great authority reading of these books pretty big before 1640, had the wit and imagination to see that as something.

39:29.985 --> 39:34.431
This is what I mean about a great collector.

39:35.255 --> 39:40.763
You can look at something, and you can imagine, and say, okay, this is its significance.

39:40.783 --> 39:49.355
Now, there are an awful lot of things that can be collected that are junk in one place, and then there's no sense in the library having it.

39:50.617 --> 39:55.143
Whereas, to another place, it's absolutely essential.

39:55.163 --> 39:59.129
Now, take the collection of American poetry over there in the John Haney, you know that?

39:59.149 --> 39:59.349
No.

39:59.990 --> 40:03.355
It's the biggest collection of American poetry in the world.

40:03.672 --> 40:07.398
someone who once described it as the biggest collection of bad poetry.

40:07.638 --> 40:16.772
But, John, the Harris collection has been collecting homes by Americans since the beginning, middle of the last century.

40:17.794 --> 40:23.983
I guess absolutely everything is published every year, regardless of how good or bad it is.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.586
So it's not selective in any way.

40:25.606 --> 40:28.891
No, but it is an archive.

40:28.911 --> 40:32.076
Now, 90% or a substantial percentage of that stuff

40:32.427 --> 40:34.090
In any other library would be junk.

40:35.251 --> 40:39.838
But because it is in that context, it becomes a rare book.

40:39.858 --> 40:41.120
An important book.

40:41.140 --> 40:45.828
Because of the context in which it exists.

40:45.848 --> 40:49.073
You know the difference between a rare book and a scarce book?

40:49.353 --> 40:52.318
Well, a scarce book is difficult to find.

40:52.338 --> 40:53.980
A rare book is worth a lot of money.

40:54.341 --> 40:54.601
No.

40:55.843 --> 40:59.008
A rare book, I mean, the Gutenberg Bible is not necessarily a rare book.

40:59.309 --> 41:00.811
for instance, not as the first one.

41:00.831 --> 41:02.272
No, no, no, no, you're wrong.

41:02.292 --> 41:03.733
The Diedenberg Bible is a rare book.

41:04.234 --> 41:05.035
It's not a scarce book.

41:05.055 --> 41:06.977
It's not a scarce book.

41:06.997 --> 41:10.640
Chris Folio is not a scarce book at all.

41:10.660 --> 41:11.621
It's a rare book.

41:11.641 --> 41:18.088
Because it has a special significance in and of itself.

41:18.889 --> 41:24.234
A scarce book is a matter of statistics.

41:24.254 --> 41:26.076
How many copies, you know,

41:26.528 --> 41:28.791
either are available or exist or something.

41:28.811 --> 41:29.972
And how many people want it, too?

41:31.133 --> 41:35.178
Well, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:35.218 --> 41:44.329
Then when somebody wants it, that's when rarity, when someone has a desire to own it, that's when rarity begins to really change.

41:44.389 --> 41:46.411
Then it begins to value it.

41:48.033 --> 41:54.240
I mean, history of science was not, were not rare books until after Sputnik.

41:55.300 --> 42:04.750
Now, one of the things, our job here is to buy books that will become rare, and we want to get them before they become rare.

42:04.790 --> 42:10.516
We want to be there and gone before the ... That's where perception comes in.

42:10.596 --> 42:18.124
Ninety percent of the basic Americana in the John Carter Brown Library, I mean the classics, were here by 1900.

42:20.966 --> 42:22.208
Roth didn't have to buy them.

42:22.328 --> 42:23.249
I didn't have to buy them.

42:23.269 --> 42:24.430
They were here.

42:25.152 --> 42:32.140
We were going off buying the things that Mr. John Carter Brown was buying when they were considered unimportant.

42:32.260 --> 42:38.187
That's the function of our kind of collection.

42:38.208 --> 42:43.434
Now, then there's the collectors who go out, and they buy only rare books.

42:43.454 --> 42:47.178
So those are books whose values have already been recognized.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.961
And it's fine.

42:49.981 --> 42:52.965
I have nothing against it, but that's a different kind of collection.

42:53.755 --> 42:54.997
That was Poetry Collection.

42:55.017 --> 42:56.939
Was that started by a private collector?

42:56.959 --> 43:03.207
It was started by a man named Anthony, uh, Anthony and Harris.

43:03.327 --> 43:04.228
They were two men.

43:06.191 --> 43:08.934
Anthony formed the collection, a man named Harris.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.698
But they were private collectors.

43:11.718 --> 43:12.519
Private collectors.

43:12.539 --> 43:16.464
And then he gave it to Brown University in the end of the last century.

43:16.484 --> 43:20.188
And then we went on doing the Harris Collection, one of the biggest things ever.

43:20.669 --> 43:23.172
The Harris Collection, you know, in addition, here,

43:23.810 --> 43:31.001
And there's a very interesting phenomenon going on in there, and Brown University, and I lived through this, this flood-rofulness.

43:31.021 --> 43:33.184
When I came here, there was a special collection.

43:33.344 --> 43:39.634
It was kind of a bumbling operation, and they had all wonderful things, but no administration in it whatsoever.

43:39.654 --> 43:42.038
They were among the goddamn Philippines.

43:42.058 --> 43:48.628
The librarian, David Jonat, loved it, so he was kind of the unofficial curator trying to run the library and everything else.

43:48.648 --> 43:50.290
Then they built the Rockefeller Library.

43:50.675 --> 43:55.399
And Dave Jeter decided he wanted to turn that, you know, hay into a rare book library.

43:55.419 --> 43:58.662
Then he retired, and things went back.

43:58.682 --> 44:04.888
Well, to make a long story short, his successor was a man named Charles Churchwell.

44:04.908 --> 44:10.333
And Charles didn't understand rare books with a hill of beans, but he was a very intelligent man.

44:11.394 --> 44:19.922
And after having played footsie with me, with I take over all the rare books at Brown, he suddenly realized that he had a responsibility.

44:20.611 --> 44:24.116
So he decided to go out and do something about that.

44:24.276 --> 44:29.965
So he appointed a young man named Samuel Streit as the Associate Librarian for Special Collections.

44:30.846 --> 44:33.150
Within the structure of a library, that's unusual.

44:33.270 --> 44:38.578
Usually, the guy in charge of rare books is reports to the reference librarian or something.

44:38.938 --> 44:41.302
But he's one of the three assistant librarians, Sam is.

44:42.023 --> 44:50.095
And Sam oversaw the renovation of that building, the installation of the Ann Consolving Brown collection of military books.

44:50.918 --> 44:53.803
the acquisition of the military books.

44:53.823 --> 44:58.291
So really, it's the private collector who dictates where your special collections are going to be, doesn't it?

44:58.311 --> 44:59.493
Up to a certain point.

45:00.495 --> 45:02.638
But there's what you do with that collection.

45:02.658 --> 45:07.326
I mean, Brown probably never thought it was going to have a preeminent collection of poetry until this guy came along.

45:07.547 --> 45:12.836
Well, in those days, you've got to understand, in those days, Leibniz didn't think of having collections.

45:13.517 --> 45:16.302
So they were thrilled to get whatever they got.

45:16.501 --> 45:19.465
No, it is a very good case in point.

45:19.485 --> 45:21.228
And I was only interested in uniforms.

45:23.070 --> 45:25.494
So the bulk of that collection is about uniforms.

45:26.215 --> 45:26.956
It's a fragment.

45:27.056 --> 45:32.283
It's a small fragment, only part of military history.

45:32.383 --> 45:34.166
There's a whole area out there to be built.

45:35.147 --> 45:36.069
And it's not very expensive.

45:36.089 --> 45:36.850
What's this person's name again?

45:37.110 --> 45:37.911
Samuel Sprite.

45:37.951 --> 45:40.635
He's the associate librarian for Special Collections.

45:40.818 --> 45:42.841
He's not here today.

45:42.861 --> 45:45.965
Yeah, but I mean this collection of military stuff that you're talking about.

45:45.985 --> 45:56.180
Well, there's that, there's the lounge collection, there's the... Stop in there and pick up... I'm going to do that.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.564
There's a book describing the special collections.

45:58.584 --> 45:59.345
I'm going to do that.

45:59.365 --> 46:00.066
That's in that building.

46:00.306 --> 46:02.129
The white one, the one to the right.

46:02.549 --> 46:03.491
The white one.

46:03.551 --> 46:04.272
Up to the desk.

46:04.312 --> 46:06.555
There is a...

46:06.721 --> 46:09.704
a very handsome thing they did, describing the very special collection.

46:09.724 --> 46:11.446
Well, I'm going to do that as soon as we break.

46:11.666 --> 46:13.928
You said you were going to tell me some stuff about Belle Green.

46:13.968 --> 46:15.169
Well, let's not go.

46:15.389 --> 46:16.631
Let's get together some other things.

46:16.691 --> 46:16.871
Okay.

46:17.151 --> 46:19.654
I really, actually, I have to go off and do it.

46:19.774 --> 46:20.655
Okay.

46:20.895 --> 46:21.415
Sounds good.

46:21.435 --> 46:23.037
Well, you've been very, very generous with him.

46:23.057 --> 46:24.759
I'll be glad to talk to you.

46:24.779 --> 46:25.920
I think you're going to like my book.

46:27.681 --> 46:29.964
Forty or so miles of each other.

46:29.984 --> 46:34.348
You do have two institutions, Jason Brown and the AAS, which together...

46:34.919 --> 46:39.623
It must have the exceptional collections of anything to do with America.

46:39.643 --> 46:44.067
And the thing about it is that we have always, the only one looks at it is your rivals.

46:44.347 --> 46:45.969
That's never been the case.

46:45.989 --> 47:00.301
From the days of Winship and Brigham, Brigham and Raw, Shipton and myself, MacArthur and myself, we realize that, see, I've described this library, that's an important question to ask, I say, I described this library.

47:00.802 --> 47:03.424
This library is really alive in European history.

47:05.092 --> 47:15.025
books relating to America, books printed in Europe by Europeans about America.

47:15.045 --> 47:17.168
The perception of America, the discovery of America.

47:17.188 --> 47:25.358
In the period in which we collect, 90% of the books relating to America were printed in Europe, written by Europeans, and addressed to Europeans.

47:25.379 --> 47:27.982
We're a dimension of European history.

47:28.002 --> 47:31.767
Whereas an Aquarian Society is United States history.

47:31.787 --> 47:32.668
Or continental.

47:33.020 --> 47:34.622
Oh, no, no, they're the United States.

47:34.702 --> 47:38.146
Well, they do predate the revolution, but they're not continental.

47:38.246 --> 47:40.128
They don't go south of the real world.

47:40.148 --> 47:45.774
Yeah, but physically, geographically, those areas that make up the United States.

47:45.834 --> 47:48.797
In the early days, the main soundbook is not United States.

47:49.017 --> 47:51.640
It was now the United States.

47:52.001 --> 47:57.607
You see, and I say, for us, the United States almost does not exist.

47:57.627 --> 47:58.948
It only came into existence.

47:59.549 --> 48:01.171
It's a political boundary, in other words.

48:01.191 --> 48:02.352
The tail end of our period.

48:03.108 --> 48:11.916
Whereas the United States, as a concept, existed before 1776 with the antiquaries.

48:11.936 --> 48:13.838
It's the colonial period of the United States.

48:13.858 --> 48:17.521
If you're a scholar, you do well to go there and here.

48:17.702 --> 48:18.843
Well, depending on what you're doing.

48:18.863 --> 48:22.866
If you're doing the United States as, quote, American.

48:22.886 --> 48:25.229
It's nice to have these two places within 45 miles of each other.

48:25.309 --> 48:27.190
Oh, yeah, and we've always gotten along splendidly.

48:27.771 --> 48:28.311
I'll talk to you.

48:28.852 --> 48:29.993
Thanks for your time.
