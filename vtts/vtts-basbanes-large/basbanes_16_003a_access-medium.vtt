00:02.393 --> 00:05.737
Can you talk to it?

00:05.757 --> 00:05.837
Yes.

00:05.857 --> 00:06.578
What can you say?

00:09.581 --> 00:10.782
Can you sing your song for me?

00:12.264 --> 00:14.266
I don't know.

00:15.147 --> 00:16.148
How does it go?

00:18.031 --> 00:18.431
Sing it.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.957
Come on, sing the song for me.

00:24.838 --> 00:25.879
What's the Spanish song?

00:28.723 --> 00:29.383
Sing your song.

00:30.244 --> 00:30.485
Okay.

00:30.505 --> 00:30.865
Go ahead.

00:32.549 --> 00:34.871
Sing it.

00:37.895 --> 00:40.537
OK.

00:41.879 --> 00:47.124
Want to hear it now?

00:49.026 --> 00:58.776
Mm-hmm.

01:00.207 --> 01:09.977
I remember when Erica Johns had written her novel, Fear of Flying, and that character was Isadora Wang, and everybody said, well, we recognize the characters, or is this really you?

01:10.037 --> 01:12.599
And she said, oh my God, how could anybody think that?

01:13.400 --> 01:17.184
It's a fiction, it's a novel, there's nothing true about it.

01:17.264 --> 01:24.391
So I started out with that line and said, you know, I'm a novel, this is fiction, there's nothing true, and people would get really bored.

01:24.952 --> 01:28.155
And then they'd say, how's the baby, and how's your house?

01:28.355 --> 01:30.559
And they wouldn't want to talk about the novel anymore.

01:30.579 --> 01:32.322
So I wised up very quickly.

01:32.362 --> 01:39.415
And now when people ask me that question, I say, well, I hope that people won't be too upset when they see themselves in the novel.

01:39.856 --> 01:46.228
And it seems to have perked everybody out in Washington about whether or not they're going to be in it.

01:46.495 --> 01:50.881
And this is my first attempt at writing a novel, so I really didn't know how it worked.

01:51.101 --> 02:05.360
But when you do sit down to do a novel, at least I did, I didn't think I'm going to take this person and that person and change the color of their hair and their names and then just have them be thinly disguised characters.

02:06.362 --> 02:08.925
I just wrote, I made up people.

02:09.378 --> 02:19.387
But I found that, particularly in the first chapter, which introduces a lot of the major characters, that when I sat down to reread it about a year after I'd written it, I was playing the game.

02:19.487 --> 02:23.170
I was saying, I wonder who I meant that to be, and I wonder who I meant this person to be.

02:24.171 --> 02:30.957
And what it turns out is that you write what you know, and things just come from, you just sort of pull it out of your head.

02:31.718 --> 02:39.385
And in the end, it really is, as Christopher Stollison once said in one of his songs, it's partly truth and partly fiction.

02:40.023 --> 02:42.752
And is it a roman play?

02:42.772 --> 02:44.317
Well, yes and no.

02:45.822 --> 02:51.180
And I thought that I would start out by explaining that to you and then see if you have any questions about the book.

02:56.881 --> 03:16.425
It's coming out toward the end of what is, of my 16 years in Washington, and measurably the most important and exciting year, because the forces that began to gather in the country in the late 17th, and produced Ronald Reagan,

03:16.405 --> 03:29.301
have reached a kind of conclusion of sorts in the intersection this year of two extraordinary bills, the Grant-Rudman bill and the tax bill, both of them being, in their ways, quite radical.

03:30.823 --> 03:35.949
And a radicalism produced, this sounds paradoxical, but it is, I think, produced by kind of sobriety.

03:36.950 --> 03:43.138
But after six years, the Congress decided that the American people weren't quite as conservative as they said they were.

03:43.658 --> 03:48.522
There's a gap between the real and the rhetorical politics in the country.

03:48.542 --> 04:01.574
And that, in fact, the only way to bring discipline to the appetites of the country is with the Graham-Rudman bill, which is, on the one hand, a feat of an irresponsible legislation passed in 20 years, probably.

04:01.594 --> 04:11.944
On the other hand, you have the tax bill that is also, like the Graham-Rudman bill, finally the product of political despair that overcame the country after these last six years.

04:13.105 --> 04:21.965
It's fair that they could free the government from the influence of the government.

04:21.985 --> 04:31.226
The government has come to look upon itself in these last six years.

04:31.246 --> 04:31.587
.

04:32.579 --> 04:35.326
And in fact, that's been part of it is surprising.

04:35.546 --> 04:38.754
On one hand, the president has done what serious good leaders do.

04:38.775 --> 04:41.802
He has forced the country to ask the answer basic question.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.787
He did not get the answer he wanted.

04:44.105 --> 04:46.008
He said, what kind of government do you want?

04:46.028 --> 04:54.240
And the answer came in after a five-year rolling referendum on budget cuts we wanted constantly to the government we've got.

04:54.561 --> 04:58.887
And I need all this tumultuous shouting about budget cuts in Washington over the last 50 years, 50 years.

04:58.907 --> 05:04.115
It's been really about the customs, margins, and through social security and the margins of food stamps and all the rest.

05:06.078 --> 05:10.585
Second, the country has had to come to terms with the cost of the deficit.

05:11.392 --> 05:21.523
and with the fact that the great that was supposed to happen, which was a self-financed taxpayer in 1981, had not to be self-financed.

05:21.803 --> 05:29.672
And it being produced was not supposed to produce, it was a deficit, which meant that there was no magic bullet for making services of payment.

05:29.692 --> 05:36.319
That was the great promise of the supply fly theory, but if you cut taxes, you would have increased revenues from lower rates.

05:37.126 --> 05:42.293
And therefore, all political choices, all difficult choices, would be nullified.

05:42.313 --> 05:51.006
So the idea of payment and conservatism has gone the way it was such a reason.

05:51.126 --> 06:03.403
In the last year, it's a country rather clean to itself, rather more sober than it was, and certainly a conservative movement which, by the rest of us, has become middle-aged in the last decade or so.

06:04.430 --> 06:22.223
and servicisms that simply has to abandon the easy rhetoric of anti-government because it's clear that it has no magic way of and he knows him's desire to seriously attack the post-tuneer role of the political government.

06:22.243 --> 06:26.050
The previous collection of columns I've done, he organized this one in a way that is

06:26.266 --> 06:38.004
I'm thinking more subtle, intelligent, complicated, rather than simply saying, people all .

06:38.304 --> 06:54.889
We try to reproduce something of the episodic experience that leaders have, and sometimes continually the conversation that exists between a columnist and his public, to weave in and out of various subjects, or that genuine leading experience of violence that one killed a guy, is a secret element of Supreme Court, I can't care.

06:55.257 --> 07:12.917
I don't write third, at least for my column, off the news, by which I don't .

07:12.937 --> 07:15.480
I'm not doing my job right.

07:15.580 --> 07:21.467
And the second thing to make this collection is more fun.

07:21.937 --> 07:36.773
is that there has been such a dominating political theme, such a dominating political personality between 1981 and 1986, that there is genuine coherence to the American experience.

07:36.914 --> 07:43.921
A few stark claims and very stark issues, and so on, make very clear lessons.

07:43.941 --> 07:50.028
But now with my state, many of them have a party more sober, and the third is more middle-aged than the best sense of history.

07:50.128 --> 07:51.690
There's no sense to that.

08:07.195 --> 08:11.333
Well, the thing is that

08:11.802 --> 08:18.011
With an autobiography, of course, you know what your story is.

08:18.292 --> 08:20.976
You know what the secrets of events were and so forth.

08:21.216 --> 08:28.588
And I would say a different part of it is treating how you treat within your text real people.

08:29.028 --> 08:31.372
And there's a constant concern.

08:31.392 --> 08:34.577
I mean, particularly, I didn't have any grudges against people.

08:34.677 --> 08:36.219
There was nothing that I wanted to.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.603
So I want to be very careful.

08:38.623 --> 08:40.105
I didn't really want to hurt anybody.

08:40.085 --> 08:56.623
So then you get into a novel and you suddenly say, for 15 minutes, I've got to, you know, I've got, okay, a little bit to begin with because my main character resembled me in the sense that she was a Hollywood sex symbol.

08:56.723 --> 09:09.096
She lost her career at the age of 35, her whole world fell apart, her husband, her studio, everybody turned against her and she moved to Rome, Italy to start a new life and a new career.

09:09.211 --> 09:21.384
And I thought, well, that's fine, because what it will give me is it'll give me an opportunity to have the reader see everything from an American's point of view.

09:21.404 --> 09:36.720
So that everything that Madeline, myself, is my main character, everything that she learns, that it gives me an opportunity to tell the reader as well Italian expressions and the way they, their mentality, the way they think about things and so forth.

09:36.700 --> 09:41.646
I mean, they have to keep a storyline going.

09:41.826 --> 10:01.972
And at a certain moment when my editor and publisher, John Fine, wanted me to, I guess, beat up the storyline or something like that, I sat for days in my living room stunned with all these chapters everywhere thinking, oh my goodness, what do you do?

10:02.512 --> 10:06.117
How do you, you know, how do I remember what,

10:06.097 --> 10:09.461
So yes, it's kind of a difficult thing.

10:09.481 --> 10:24.381
On the other hand, it allowed me to show the real behind the scenes of movie making, which I think must have ring with an authenticity because I really do know it.

10:24.662 --> 10:30.349
And it also gave me a chance to take very famous people off their pedestals.

10:30.700 --> 10:40.797
And perhaps I was a little bitchier than I should have been, but I wasn't ready to do that at all.

10:40.817 --> 10:43.802
Also, all these mad sex things, you see.

10:43.822 --> 10:53.338
So, I mean, a lot of them were based on, shall we say, things that I heard about.

10:53.518 --> 10:55.341
But it gave me an opportunity to put them in.

10:55.321 --> 11:04.017
For example, and sometimes they say the truth is strange in fiction.

11:04.398 --> 11:12.233
I discovered that there's a very popular party game of the Italian play which is called group masturbation.

11:12.668 --> 11:23.226
Now, you know, I don't know about writing that in an autobiographical way and say, well, I was invited to this wonderful party.

11:24.608 --> 11:30.058
But in a novel, it worked very well to say, hey, now, is this for real or not?

11:30.178 --> 11:33.964
But actually, it's quite true.

11:34.325 --> 11:37.410
Because it hasn't

11:37.390 --> 11:42.822
as young people are kept with their mothers and the church.

11:42.842 --> 11:45.688
Keep such a tight hold of those of them.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.331
You know, kids will be kids.

11:47.351 --> 11:52.783
There's been heavy petting in the back of cars or someplace.

11:53.017 --> 12:00.994
They all lie down and there's no chance of anybody getting pregnant or anything.

12:01.214 --> 12:07.828
They're all going to continue to reverse because everybody's doing it to themselves.

12:07.848 --> 12:08.269
Things really happen.

12:08.289 --> 12:09.051
Do we have time for one more question?

12:09.841 --> 12:19.651
Yeah, well, life is pretty full at the moment.

12:19.671 --> 12:27.239
I'm very fortunate in that after I showed my wild oats, I came back to the love of one man.

12:27.319 --> 12:29.101
And I'm very happily married.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.745
I married a British actor called Donald Burton five years ago.

12:33.265 --> 12:36.709
And we live in Hampstead, which is in London.

12:36.689 --> 12:40.355
I have a lovely English garden.

12:40.415 --> 12:46.184
There's no joy in any garden in the world, like in England or Ireland, where there's not much rainfall.

12:47.126 --> 12:52.515
And at this time, I have a very quiet time to sit and write, and it's lovely.

12:52.535 --> 13:01.870
I have little stores, charming little stores that are from another century right across the street by me.

13:02.390 --> 13:08.221
And also, you know, the thing is that that is pretty isolating work.

13:08.381 --> 13:13.992
And I think it's been a long time just, you know, being by myself and writing.

13:14.593 --> 13:19.943
But now I do a movie called Made of Sun.

13:20.311 --> 13:26.537
with Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Page, and that's based on the famous Richard Wright book.

13:26.557 --> 13:36.247
I just finished that, and now I'm in the midst of my book tour, which I think everybody in this room understands what that is.

13:36.267 --> 13:47.398
The instant that I finished, I just saw a lead next to John Forsythe from Dynasty, Jennifer Carrington, I think, Jennifer Carrington.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.505
in an ABC movie a week.

13:51.447 --> 14:00.806
Then I go back to London, and I have a play which I've written, which they want to do in Dublin, but it needs a rewrite.

14:01.668 --> 14:09.403
So hopefully I'll have time to do that, because now I'm also doing British Irish films in Nepal in August.

14:09.788 --> 14:22.686
So I always say, you know, that if you're an actor out of work, all you need to do to find work is either sign up for a college course, which you can't get the money back on, or a vacation with an apex there.

14:23.367 --> 14:26.071
So I think it's also true about writing books.

14:26.091 --> 14:31.899
If you really get into it and you love the writing, then we all be asking for it to come your way, too.

14:31.919 --> 14:33.501
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, very much.

14:40.231 --> 14:45.016
morning teetokers.

14:45.036 --> 14:47.339
I'm assuming we're all teetokers.

14:47.359 --> 14:55.609
Nobody in the politicians would have a meeting to serve in the morning.

14:55.629 --> 15:07.903
There's a publisher among you this morning who is rewriting this entire scene in abject, silent disbelief.

15:08.003 --> 15:09.985
A disbelief on a life that

15:10.707 --> 15:19.129
Billy's a lady that I ran into in a place probably now, Red Square in Moscow just three or four days ago.

15:20.833 --> 15:26.067
From her I got a twist on the question, frequently asked by fans,

15:27.127 --> 15:37.960
Are you who I think you are?

15:37.980 --> 15:49.053
When one person can immodestly answer that question with a simple yes, assuming that you are who they think you are.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.155
But that seems to me to be taking a very heavy chance.

15:53.138 --> 15:56.121
I can't be absolutely certain

15:56.708 --> 15:59.793
who they think I am.

15:59.813 --> 16:04.980
That might be Robert Redford.

16:09.206 --> 16:11.049
Winston Churchill.

16:11.069 --> 16:16.557
But my little friend in Red Square in America, of course, had a real question on this phrase.

16:17.439 --> 16:24.589
Believe it or not, she said, Can I believe you are who I think I see?

16:29.632 --> 16:40.782
Well, this publisher might be asking them the very same question.

16:42.063 --> 16:53.974
I must say that I have had with his firm the longest standing unfulfilled book contract in modern publishing business.

16:53.994 --> 16:57.377
As a matter of fact, he's not even the

16:57.728 --> 17:17.108
publisher who was head of the publishing house when I made it on time.

17:17.128 --> 17:18.369
That was two or three heads of the publishing house ago.

17:18.389 --> 17:19.170
It was just that long ago.

17:19.190 --> 17:21.692
Oh, my, the publishing doesn't mean it was that long ago.

17:21.712 --> 17:24.055
And this was it was some time ago.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.396
I think I might tell you that story quickly.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.697
I'm sure about how things can go in this business of publishing.

17:26.717 --> 17:27.398
I had a very good friend who had

17:27.867 --> 17:33.334
I should call Tommy the guy that happened to his name.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.899
He was a very good friend.

17:36.919 --> 17:42.346
He and his family and all his kids, and our kids were growing up together, going to school together.

17:42.366 --> 17:46.191
He was a little younger, so he happened to put speed on the weekend.

17:46.211 --> 17:48.694
We've been to the very well, so we've been to the very well.

17:49.248 --> 17:59.143
But Tony became an absolute bolder with me because every time we were together, he marked on this idea that I had to write the definitive book.

17:59.744 --> 18:02.768
I had to do the book.

18:02.788 --> 18:03.449
And it really got me.

18:03.469 --> 18:04.211
I told him, fine.

18:04.311 --> 18:06.955
I said, Tony, I can't go on like this anymore.

18:06.975 --> 18:10.600
I mean, here's a boring teller.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.945
He said, I don't want to have to tell you.

18:13.965 --> 18:14.586
I'll do it someday.

18:14.606 --> 18:15.107
It's someday.

18:15.127 --> 18:15.327
I'm tired.

18:15.347 --> 18:18.071
I'll tell you what you'll make a deal with me.

18:18.091 --> 18:18.512
I'll promise you.

18:18.644 --> 18:21.469
But you'll get it.

18:21.490 --> 18:31.289
But you've got to promise me that you'll never mention it again until the deadline of the book.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.092
He said, I'll do it.

18:35.283 --> 18:45.389
And sure enough, we met, and he had a contract.

18:45.590 --> 18:49.480
There was no deadline for the book.

18:50.282 --> 18:52.127
And everyone should

18:52.782 --> 19:03.133
any of his ears.

19:03.153 --> 19:04.094
I don't have to do it again.

19:04.114 --> 19:10.160
The only thing is what he said to you, you know, lawyers, even what they are, they insist there's no contract unless there's a lot of money in the banks of some kind.

19:11.021 --> 19:12.202
Because I said, look at the banks.

19:12.223 --> 19:14.285
I don't want any strings on this, either at all.

19:14.305 --> 19:17.628
But they're mainly different for small banks.

19:17.648 --> 19:18.930
They're very small.

19:18.950 --> 19:19.330
They're very small.

19:19.715 --> 19:28.242
And, of course, I was so stupid that I could have been a Hesco.

19:28.262 --> 19:29.804
You know, Reverend Bates, it's been 25 years.

19:29.824 --> 19:30.564
And I thought he was a Hesco.

19:30.584 --> 19:31.225
I could have been a Hesco.

19:31.245 --> 19:32.986
But I put it there in case I don't get the book written.

19:33.427 --> 19:36.529
Now I'm waiting for it.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.611
Now I'm waiting for it.

19:38.731 --> 19:40.233
Before, a century later.

19:40.253 --> 19:43.155
Wouldn't you know, right away, I've got a problem yet.

19:44.316 --> 19:48.760
He says, he'd like to concentrate on its holiday year.

19:49.820 --> 20:15.997
And I said, no, I think some of the farm work interests is fascinating, I think.

20:16.017 --> 20:16.858
It would be the form of the Jesus Christ.

20:16.878 --> 20:17.138
My childhood.

20:17.158 --> 20:17.559
Maybe the age of 10.

20:17.579 --> 20:18.100
Maybe even my other group.

20:18.120 --> 20:18.701
You know, think of the drama.

20:18.721 --> 20:18.921
The drama.

20:18.941 --> 20:19.141
The drama.

20:19.161 --> 20:19.402
The romance.

20:19.422 --> 20:19.742
My first mother.

20:21.072 --> 20:22.594
You've got many years.

20:24.677 --> 20:29.804
He's good, isn't he?

20:29.824 --> 20:30.645
We're working on it.

20:30.665 --> 20:31.546
Not for nothing.

20:31.566 --> 20:33.669
In the past, a year, two, three.

20:34.510 --> 20:36.894
And I mean one.

20:37.735 --> 20:46.286
Meanwhile, the marvelous artist, I have turned down another of our epic works for Oxfam House.

20:48.229 --> 20:49.611
That's our first time.

20:50.165 --> 21:02.016
or South by South, just a couple of years ago, was, as you all know, an absolutely resounding success.

21:02.036 --> 21:02.176
It was.

21:02.196 --> 21:09.682
I mean, if you hadn't heard, it was an art book, a coffee table book, which Ray did.

21:09.803 --> 21:18.130
They've absolutely superb paintings, and I did something less than superb, but an adequate job of the text.

21:32.926 --> 21:39.798
We're at the southeast coast of the United States, roughly from Baltimore, down the waterway to Key West.

21:40.499 --> 21:45.668
And I rather basically follow that route and try to do the text.

21:47.391 --> 21:51.939
I want to be candid with you, though, because we are all in the same business together.

21:51.959 --> 21:58.630
I think you're trying to know what goes on behind the scenes of these book adventures.

22:01.242 --> 22:05.790
fertile brains with lots more people than ready.

22:05.810 --> 22:20.035
When they suggested a dual-test partner, Margaret Ginger, might adequately do a text for the book, they came to him and said, well, there could be a hundred release changes in this big, lovely book.

22:20.376 --> 22:23.301
And we'd like about 10,000 words in text for that.

22:26.943 --> 22:34.892
Mathematical mom, that one is very good at this side.

22:34.912 --> 22:38.817
It was the lack of people that only Einstein would appreciate.

22:38.837 --> 22:41.220
I, by the way, said 100 paintings, 10,000 words, that 100 words will mean.

22:43.362 --> 22:49.570
Now, any poor old broken down newspaper can write a 100 word cut line for almost any picture.

22:49.590 --> 22:49.930
That's my word.

22:50.348 --> 22:54.136
So I said, there's nothing to this.

22:54.156 --> 22:55.799
It's the most wonderful assignment I've ever had.

22:55.819 --> 23:01.671
I always wanted some excuse to go all the way down the waterway in one full trail.

23:01.691 --> 23:04.797
I'd start with my book from Baltimore, and I'd have great training in front of me.

23:05.249 --> 23:12.976
And I just talked with these wonderful houses, these historic monuments, and these things.

23:13.096 --> 23:14.777
And I wrote 200 words on each.

23:14.797 --> 23:17.419
I wrote a story, a number of words when I got the article.

23:17.439 --> 23:22.264
But at the time I got the U.S., I don't want to finish both.

23:22.284 --> 23:23.845
And what could be easier than that?

23:23.865 --> 23:24.325
So I'm all set.

23:24.345 --> 23:24.606
I'm involved.

23:24.626 --> 23:30.751
I'm ready to say I'm waiting for the packages to have raised opinions in the slides that I can follow on the trip down.

23:31.752 --> 23:33.393
The package arrived.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.294
I had great expectations.

23:37.987 --> 23:50.181
Man in both.

23:50.582 --> 24:00.433
Lonely man.

24:01.173 --> 24:12.424
Only boat.

24:12.444 --> 24:12.745
Beach was land.

24:12.765 --> 24:12.985
Only beach.

24:13.005 --> 24:13.286
Boat and dock.

24:13.306 --> 24:13.647
Boat and no dock.

24:19.415 --> 24:31.138
Well, I had to reach out to the thing.

24:31.158 --> 24:33.563
I had a theme, you know, train of thought, do this whole thing.

24:33.583 --> 24:34.164
It changed my whole view.

24:34.184 --> 24:36.829
What I had to do was remember the apartment on the foot leg next to you.

24:36.849 --> 24:38.693
Of course, I'm giving Parsons, only Parsons to get here.

24:38.713 --> 24:39.655
That's basically what the book was.

24:39.675 --> 24:41.338
But they did have some marvelous pictures.

24:41.892 --> 24:52.785
the painting of Charleston and Key West and Savannah and a lot of those things.

24:52.805 --> 25:04.279
And the book was, as I say, we're happy to say not only a critical success, but a commercial success, enough so that Oxmoor and Ray and I could decide that the sequel was ordered.

25:04.299 --> 25:11.207
And we've now been going with the Northeast, a longer, somewhat more personal text on my part.

25:15.473 --> 25:21.239
I think the book will be equally well to see.

25:21.500 --> 25:35.996
I think I'm looking forward to going out and deal with you a few, I'm afraid, book signings.

25:36.156 --> 25:41.202
There's a few that will be limited by a lot of other activities.

25:41.222 --> 25:43.144
I really do like book signings.

25:44.005 --> 25:45.126
I know that goes accountable mostly.

25:45.359 --> 25:54.092
I kind of enjoy getting out and meeting the people.

25:54.192 --> 26:00.442
I've never quite understood why people are so anxious about that.

26:00.462 --> 26:02.925
I don't understand the other autographs.

26:03.847 --> 26:11.759
I really don't understand the autographs on the back of a match cover and on the corner of a cocktail napkin.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.982
I just don't know what people do with those.

26:14.283 --> 26:21.715
I think I know.

26:22.756 --> 26:26.062
I think they take them home.

26:26.082 --> 26:33.033
I think they don't in the top drawer with all the stuff in their pockets or their pocketbooks.

26:33.053 --> 26:36.177
And they take around there with the loose chains and the pennies for two or three or four years.

26:36.198 --> 26:38.201
They keep looking at them and think, oh, it's going away.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.965
And they don't finally throw their pennies to something so they can't agree with them.

26:41.367 --> 26:48.156
signature, if they ever couldn't be, that they'd buy them for the way.

26:48.176 --> 26:52.542
I doubt that Rupert ever takes it downstairs to show Aunt Maude.

26:52.562 --> 26:52.943
He might, he might.

26:52.963 --> 26:54.525
And then I've got one other scenario that I really worried about.

26:55.727 --> 27:02.776
I see him taking it down to Aunt Maude, and Aunt Maude taking a look and saying, what does it say?

27:02.796 --> 27:04.439
He says, it's a border crime package.

27:04.459 --> 27:04.759
Oh, yeah.

27:05.566 --> 27:21.313
You know, what are they doing?

27:25.580 --> 27:27.062
Then they get this diabolical idea, let's send it out and have it analyze.

27:27.082 --> 27:27.363
One hand away.

27:27.383 --> 27:27.904
That's the most weird way.

27:27.924 --> 27:29.066
Comes back, order trying to get a lady with sex monsters.

27:29.086 --> 27:29.707
See the way you call it in tea.

27:29.727 --> 27:31.590
I don't want to be a lady with sex monsters.

27:46.640 --> 27:59.396
Some of my best friends read about that.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.338
But I was signing, and we had a pretty good signing out there.

28:01.358 --> 28:03.200
People were lined up down the block.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.323
It was a pretty good line.

28:05.343 --> 28:11.731
And finally this chap gets up there in the front, and he's the young lady by my age.

28:12.431 --> 28:15.415
He gets up there and asks me the book.

28:16.002 --> 28:20.067
And he says, would you make up my daughter Nancy for Nancy?

28:20.087 --> 28:21.629
Sign that name and hand it back to him.

28:23.031 --> 28:25.574
He looks at it and he doesn't leave.

28:25.755 --> 28:28.078
And finally, I get the line moving.

28:28.098 --> 28:31.322
I reach around him and get the book from the next person to start signing.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.765
He gets a hint and moves on.

28:33.785 --> 28:34.286
It was an hour later.

28:35.227 --> 28:36.709
Here he was in front of me again.

28:37.329 --> 28:39.032
He'd been in the line again for an hour.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.655
He hands it to me and says,

28:42.783 --> 28:47.168
What does that say?

28:48.029 --> 29:03.528
It says, that's for your daughter, for Nancy.

29:03.608 --> 29:10.416
What does that say down there?

29:10.436 --> 29:11.017
That's my signature.

29:11.037 --> 29:11.457
Would you print that?

29:22.642 --> 29:27.486
I'm going to do a few signs.

29:27.506 --> 29:31.009
There are going to be a little bit of gray.

29:31.309 --> 29:32.330
This is my semi-retirement.

29:32.350 --> 29:34.572
It's sort of a joke.

29:35.073 --> 29:42.779
I found semi-retirement in the myth perpetrated on unsuspectly working public by my line management.

29:42.799 --> 29:43.780
Nothing to it at all.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.643
I'm working harder than I was before.

29:46.663 --> 29:47.323
I said, that's it.

29:47.343 --> 29:48.604
I just got back.

29:48.624 --> 29:51.687
It was on Wednesday night on a trip to Eastern Europe.

29:53.236 --> 29:56.841
a documentary on CPS.

29:57.122 --> 30:02.350
We were in East Germany and I was still hungry.

30:03.532 --> 30:07.658
I wasn't concerned about the fall, about the radiation.

30:08.459 --> 30:14.829
We had breathed the air, drank the water, ate the leafy vegetables.

30:14.929 --> 30:17.954
Oh, there's just one thing we did.

30:18.354 --> 30:21.459
We got our snapshots back in the drugstore yesterday.

30:21.479 --> 30:22.180
They're all extra.

30:25.197 --> 30:37.870
I don't know if anything will happen with the space program before then.

30:47.801 --> 30:49.102
I'm still in the running, but I'll be the first travels to space.

30:49.122 --> 30:49.703
Space is deeply enthusiastic.

30:50.020 --> 31:01.894
The plan was, for about this time of the year, the training would have already begun for the selected journalist and his or her backup.

31:02.535 --> 31:11.705
Now, of course, the challenge of everything is the way, you know, when the training will start, when the final selection will be made, or when the flight will become.

31:11.725 --> 31:12.066
I'm here for now.

31:12.086 --> 31:15.690
I think I had a fairly good chance of making it when it was going to be this fall.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.138
I don't know him.

31:18.158 --> 31:25.425
I doubt very seriously that the program itself will get underway even when they think it might in the summer of 87.

31:25.445 --> 31:26.987
I think it'll be longer than that.

31:27.007 --> 31:30.971
I think before a passenger goes, it'll be quite a bit longer than that.

31:32.012 --> 31:35.656
And I don't know the time they run out of time.

31:35.676 --> 31:44.125
I think now it's sort of a race between their getting their plumbing fixed before mine turns out.

31:46.450 --> 32:14.179
I think, and this is very serious, I think that the non-fiction book, particularly the current history type book, never has had a more important role to play than it does right now in our affluent

32:16.100 --> 32:38.730
popular society, there are so many diversions that are demanding our attention and our time that all of our means of communication and scenes caught up in that competition are constantly progressing, compacting the information that they're relaying to us.

32:38.750 --> 32:44.217
On television, our documentary is almost a thing of the past, almost dead.

32:47.622 --> 32:54.930
guests come and go so quickly they can hardly get the snooper up as to who they are before they're off the air again.

32:54.950 --> 33:01.558
The evening news broadcast is time to try to write history on the head of the pin.

33:01.578 --> 33:14.393
The newspapers fill their columns with features and preserve the news and single lines under some generic deadline for National, International, and Global News.

33:14.413 --> 33:16.515
I fear that the public does not get

33:17.356 --> 33:20.539
enough information, enough news.

33:20.559 --> 33:26.705
We need to be in a kid, asked in a fashion that never matches his people.

33:26.725 --> 33:27.586
We're not being in a kid with Bill.

33:28.327 --> 33:34.653
And we're not getting enough information, any of this, to intelligently exercise a franchise.

33:35.935 --> 33:43.963
And as Thomas Jefferson said a long time ago, ignorant democracy is something that never will be, never can, never will be.

33:43.983 --> 33:46.485
We have to understand the issue.

33:46.803 --> 34:02.300
in order to exercise our judgment on what our national policy should be, we're simply not getting that information, except the one fallback grace we had is books.

34:03.501 --> 34:14.713
Books, as they have ever since before the movement, or ever since, are still the one best source of complete information.

34:14.733 --> 34:16.135
You, yourself,

34:16.705 --> 34:22.073
can be proud of your role in spreading at least a liberal excitement.

34:24.337 --> 34:29.224
Now, all we gotta do is teach the public to read.

34:29.244 --> 34:34.131
Then maybe we can make some progress.

34:34.151 --> 34:46.510
Well, it's my pleasure to introduce two real authors to you, both of them friends of mine, although prior to this morning, I'm only met one

34:47.654 --> 34:58.413
But when I had not met a person that had come to know as a friend through his books, he's a gifted writer.

34:59.495 --> 35:03.202
And that's about the worst thing you can say about a person.

35:03.222 --> 35:07.289
It's like saying that suddenly a star was born.

35:08.592 --> 35:12.058
The gift is far as the hat published.

35:12.950 --> 35:20.880
But it takes an awful lot of hard work as a moment into something that is practical and of real value.

35:20.920 --> 35:27.649
That is what our author has certainly done.

35:27.669 --> 35:37.882
Although I must say that by golly it must be great to have the advantage to be blessed with an Irish views as he has.

35:38.763 --> 35:40.425
To be able to string together

35:42.008 --> 35:56.928
It may be because I know very well the locale of this first book, The Whiskey Island, thanks to the great list in introducing me to it.

35:56.948 --> 35:59.292
It's actually his favorite island, Hilton Head.

36:00.533 --> 36:05.660
It's a remarkable place in any of you who read the book or some of the movies called Conrad.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.404
You know what it's like in real black water.

36:10.730 --> 36:15.115
But knowing that, I could associate intimately with that book.

36:16.036 --> 36:19.981
And we became friends through it.

36:20.182 --> 36:24.487
I didn't know his family very well until the second book, and we became even better friends.

36:25.488 --> 36:39.505
A couple of magazines, a piece that he's written, really brought home to me and confirmed, I believe, that he is really one of the great writers coming out of that reading ground, the great writers of Southern Henry.

36:40.244 --> 37:02.873
Now I can scarcely wait until I read this new book.

37:02.893 --> 37:05.857
Ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Connelly.

37:05.877 --> 37:06.117
Booktellers.

37:07.582 --> 37:35.366
and all others who have taken the vow of poverty.

37:35.386 --> 37:36.688
Speaking after the war for contact, I must sound like a parakeet.

37:36.708 --> 37:37.268
Now I have grown very tired,

37:37.973 --> 37:43.820
of being a literary weakness.

37:43.920 --> 37:51.550
And I was discussing my career several years ago with my agent, the pretentiously named Julian Bach.

37:54.593 --> 37:57.817
Julian took me through a window overlooking Third Avenue.

37:59.740 --> 38:04.926
At one time, tens of thousands of people streaming by

38:07.252 --> 38:29.197
And two of them said, yes, if we stopped the next 10,000 people who went by on the streets, only three of them would know your name.

38:29.217 --> 38:31.099
And two of them would have been mistaken for an Irish bus driver in the prom.

38:33.830 --> 38:39.097
And he said, I know why people do not know your name.

38:39.117 --> 38:45.945
There is not enough sex in your mouth.

38:45.965 --> 39:00.704
There are too many people going to the bathroom.

39:00.724 --> 39:03.167
Why is there not more sex in your mouth?

39:03.187 --> 39:03.668
It's fascinating.

39:07.175 --> 39:25.371
Julie and I said, because my grandmother is still alive.

39:25.391 --> 39:27.753
Now I'll speak to you today about my life as a southern writer.

39:27.773 --> 39:31.456
My mother raised me to be a southern writer.

39:31.476 --> 39:34.118
My mother did not go to college.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.540
Some of you guys in the head that I would do this.

39:38.630 --> 39:41.875
Now, there's much people needed in my life, even at this convention.

39:42.797 --> 39:54.114
And as I passed Tom Consolino, my friend, the other day, Tom was going to a Tony party at New York.

39:54.134 --> 39:59.403
Tom was going to smother himself and gain weight from the campground.

39:59.423 --> 40:02.848
I was seeing shuttles out from the other southern riders where we reached it.

40:04.145 --> 40:10.552
One of the prized genitalia of Crawdads.

40:10.573 --> 40:17.080
In the measure of something that has happened in my entire career now.

40:17.100 --> 40:17.300
My family.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.204
I will tell you this story that it is in Prince of Cyprus.

40:20.224 --> 40:24.569
My father, an Irishman, is huge.

40:24.589 --> 40:28.954
The pictures of Greek War fighter pilots.

40:29.272 --> 40:34.759
My daughter, my sister, when we were growing up, called him, got a bill.

40:34.779 --> 40:36.281
But he came over the years.

40:36.381 --> 40:39.846
Later, he became Mount St.

40:39.866 --> 40:40.246
Helm.

40:40.266 --> 40:43.110
She called the other day and said, How is your noble?

40:47.876 --> 40:56.146
My father, in World War II, was sick of Atlanta, Georgia.

40:56.347 --> 40:58.249
And as he so eloquently phrased it,

40:58.668 --> 41:04.857
He was out on Peachtree Street hustling broad.

41:04.877 --> 41:25.806
When my mother, 17 years old, walks into her hideous history and crosses the street to catch a bus, my mother pursuing her as Chicago Irish can do, my mother ignoring him as southern girls are supposed to.

41:26.444 --> 41:30.290
He begged him for the phone number.

41:30.310 --> 41:31.592
The bus started coming.

41:31.752 --> 41:35.218
He said he should die in the war very soon.

41:35.238 --> 41:35.759
He decided to talk to him.

41:35.779 --> 41:36.920
She gets on the bus.

41:38.022 --> 41:42.269
She walks back and sits down, and my father goes in, please, for the phone number, please.

41:42.629 --> 41:54.628
The bus starts shaking off, and my father in a foot race goes afterward until my mother leans out and screams out the phone number to my father.

41:54.811 --> 42:18.567
When they make children who hear the story from the screen, tell them the wrong number.

42:18.588 --> 42:18.928
Then my father...

42:20.613 --> 42:43.616
that my confused pilot is, and I assume the temperature of this room.

42:43.636 --> 42:46.039
The beautiful Irish capital produced a southern writing that is amazing, and that the unicorn gave birth to an escargot.

42:46.059 --> 42:47.160
Now, the southern part of this family, I must tell you,

42:47.798 --> 42:50.421
They read my books, and I did this every time.

42:50.441 --> 42:53.645
I had phone calls, every time.

42:53.665 --> 43:02.174
I usually read your new book, and it is about... Speak slowly and spell all the big words, right?

43:02.194 --> 43:02.355
Exactly.

43:12.086 --> 43:13.868
They didn't know how hard you get, it's close.

43:13.888 --> 43:16.911
In the southern family they came from...

43:17.870 --> 43:26.768
When they went to church, they'd feel bad if they came out of church laughing and kissed a rattlesnake on the top of their head.

43:26.788 --> 43:35.987
A religion so proven, so crazy, when they come to book science, and this is true, they hand out pamphlets.

43:36.007 --> 43:37.971
They quote some Gideon Bibles.

43:38.491 --> 43:47.139
They stole from the small motels all over the South.

43:47.519 --> 43:51.123
And they led people, for the love of God, not to buy my book.

43:51.143 --> 43:57.149
But like other members of my family, since the person, now I'll say the person.

43:57.389 --> 44:00.712
The person is not the one you're flying in the Busty Avikana.

44:00.732 --> 44:02.273
I published a book myself called The Blue.

44:03.635 --> 44:07.198
In the innocence of this Southern writer, I have written

44:07.432 --> 44:13.160
150 papers for a guy named Colonel Porcy, a citizen who was nicely employed.

44:14.582 --> 44:17.386
I finished the manuscript of Southern Rider Blast.

44:17.987 --> 44:19.028
I took it up to him.

44:21.332 --> 44:26.599
He smoked his cigar and he said, Bubba, you're an English major.

44:27.720 --> 44:29.403
How do you know about getting this book published?

44:30.645 --> 44:31.786
I said, come on, I have no idea.

44:33.108 --> 44:34.129
This is all the truth.

44:35.572 --> 44:37.354
He smoked his cigar and he said,

44:38.144 --> 44:39.626
Let's look at the yellow page.

44:42.148 --> 44:44.471
And that's it.

44:44.491 --> 44:46.313
And it was pretty.

44:46.333 --> 44:53.421
I found business cards, invitations, books.

44:53.441 --> 44:54.562
I went in, I said, I'm with this book.

44:54.642 --> 44:55.724
I'd like you to publish it.

44:55.944 --> 44:58.587
It says you can find it.

44:58.607 --> 45:00.028
They go, there's $2,000.

45:00.048 --> 45:01.090
We'll give you $5,000.

45:01.110 --> 45:01.690
I went to it.

45:01.710 --> 45:05.775
Willie Chalmers, the bank fusion.

45:05.795 --> 45:06.776
Willie, he won several brands.

45:06.796 --> 45:07.797
He left his money.

45:09.616 --> 45:17.583
God published the book, When Julian Mocked, The Pretentiously Named Agent, that I finally got.

45:19.365 --> 45:33.437
My wonderful, wonderful lady, William Mock, when he called me to tell me, after the water is vile, and why he teaches me to this day to take you to soul from the house instead of the four seasons.

45:33.457 --> 45:36.440
When he called me to tell me, I hope that I wanted to do my book.

45:37.661 --> 45:39.302
He said, Dad, here's the great thing.

45:40.244 --> 45:41.485
$7,500.

45:41.806 --> 46:05.391
And I said, Julian, I don't think Willie Shepard's going to lend me that much money.

46:12.627 --> 46:15.832
or have someone play that.

46:16.353 --> 46:19.798
I took my pocket down to see someone filming the Great Santeen.

46:19.818 --> 46:26.848
And I had this amazing moment of my father watching the Robertson ball, playing him.

46:27.950 --> 46:30.694
Michael O'Keefe, playing me.

46:32.156 --> 46:40.188
I saw him play theater playing my mother, and I saw my mother tell him play theater how to save the world.

46:40.208 --> 46:41.250
Didn't give a moment

46:41.534 --> 46:45.018
that has made me lose for me for all time.

46:45.038 --> 46:46.139
I saw my mother act.

46:46.159 --> 46:48.781
They put her in a basketball thing right behind Light Hill.

46:49.602 --> 46:52.986
The mother, she is playing whatever this is.

46:54.387 --> 47:03.456
And I got to go to my mother and they hit a scene in the basketball game where they told the crowd to pretend they were watching the game.

47:03.556 --> 47:07.480
And my mother, I saw my mother's head going.

47:07.500 --> 47:10.343
But it came to a wonderful moment where my mother,

47:10.981 --> 47:14.485
I realized he couldn't act.

47:14.505 --> 47:23.676
There's a scene where the boy breaks another boy's leg, and they didn't react in shock.

47:23.696 --> 47:24.657
A white man reacts this way.

47:24.677 --> 47:31.905
My mother is sitting directly behind her, reacting like this.

47:32.365 --> 47:40.735
Hey, Michael O'Keefe and Robert Duvall were nominated for Academy Awards.

47:41.963 --> 48:05.667
My father came flying through the door and he said, son, you and I were nominated for a test before.

48:05.687 --> 48:07.770
Your mother didn't give nothing.

48:07.790 --> 48:08.190
Last year,

48:09.301 --> 48:11.845
We come back to this movie again.

48:11.965 --> 48:15.530
My brothers and I sit there and watch this now.

48:15.550 --> 48:19.776
Because the one thing the movie has done for us, we didn't know it would do.

48:19.977 --> 48:24.263
It is now the only place we can see my mother alive.

48:28.048 --> 48:29.430
So we watch this film again.

48:30.251 --> 48:31.673
And when she's dying, he asks me.

48:33.436 --> 48:35.078
She's in the room.

48:35.098 --> 48:36.861
My mother is the prettiest woman I've ever seen.

48:39.153 --> 48:50.148
reduced to 80 pounds, vomiting, diarrhea, and she was awake at 3 in the morning.

48:51.550 --> 48:56.777
And I was sleeping in this rude liver, taking care of her.

48:56.998 --> 48:59.781
And she asked me a question.

49:00.482 --> 49:01.243
She said, son, am I in your new book?

49:01.263 --> 49:01.844
I said, no.

49:01.864 --> 49:02.325
I said, you're black.

49:02.345 --> 49:05.109
But I said, okay, mom, you're in the new book.

49:05.129 --> 49:07.472
She said, you weren't good enough to get me in the Great Santini.

49:08.262 --> 49:19.279
because you weren't a good enough writer, I was far more powerful than your father.

49:19.500 --> 49:21.924
I said, I know, Mom.

49:22.224 --> 49:26.851
But if I put Chernobyl and you into the same book, no one would believe it.

49:26.891 --> 49:28.133
She said, I'll ask you one thing.

49:28.254 --> 49:32.400
And I said, Mom, you're in a great position to bargain.

49:32.420 --> 49:36.126
And she said, don't make it like this.

49:37.810 --> 49:41.856
Make me beautiful.

49:41.876 --> 49:46.483
Promise me you'll make me beautiful.

49:46.503 --> 49:49.528
And I love being such a great man.

49:51.010 --> 49:54.295
And I said, Mama, I'm going to make you so beautiful.

49:54.315 --> 49:57.159
And I'm going to raise the way you are.

49:57.179 --> 50:01.706
And because you taught me to be a writer and raised me to be a writer, I can lift you off that bed.

50:01.726 --> 50:03.950
And I can set you safe.

50:05.051 --> 50:06.113
And I can set you in.

50:07.038 --> 50:17.331
and I could make you beautiful again for everybody in the world.

50:20.575 --> 50:24.881
And my mother said, I'd love Meryl Streep to play the role.

50:24.901 --> 50:32.671
And when she died, my brothers and sisters and I sat around in bed, and we read her poetry when she went into the coma.

50:33.792 --> 50:35.374
And we sent her off a wave of land,

50:37.075 --> 50:43.321
This way to the language that all of us belongs in.

50:43.341 --> 50:45.483
You are here today because you love the language.

50:45.803 --> 50:47.504
I am here today because my mother wanted me to write.

50:47.765 --> 51:03.098
Thank you.

51:03.118 --> 51:06.542
Hey, what's going on down here?

51:06.562 --> 51:07.082
Oh, it's just out of town.

51:13.981 --> 51:17.284
Well, Nicole, what are you doing in a silly basket?

51:18.866 --> 51:22.950
Can you sing the Diet Pepsi song?

51:23.351 --> 51:27.615
Try again.

51:27.936 --> 51:28.476
Try again.

51:28.516 --> 51:29.117
Try again.

51:29.357 --> 51:30.178
Start again.

51:30.218 --> 51:31.940
Start again.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.463
You can do it.

51:35.043 --> 51:37.225
We have to help.

51:37.346 --> 51:39.428
Now can I tell one?

51:39.628 --> 51:41.410
Yeah, all right, great.

51:41.430 --> 51:42.871
I want to tell the ghost.

51:43.212 --> 51:43.532
Go ahead.

51:45.790 --> 51:48.132
I got a different ghost song, Daddy.

51:48.152 --> 51:49.273
Okay, let's hear it.

51:49.293 --> 51:53.196
Here comes a ghost, a light and scary ghost.

51:53.897 --> 51:55.999
Oh, see it in the trees.

51:56.019 --> 51:58.681
Oh, who can it be?

51:58.721 --> 52:01.304
Here comes a ghost.

52:03.405 --> 52:05.507
Oh, how about you?

52:05.527 --> 52:05.687
I can't.

52:07.209 --> 52:08.650
You can do it.

52:09.170 --> 52:10.652
We'll have to help.

52:11.072 --> 52:14.515
Okay, let's hear it.

52:15.625 --> 52:17.047
Go ahead.

52:17.067 --> 52:18.208
I got something.

52:18.649 --> 52:19.990
Want to hear a joke, Dad?

52:20.010 --> 52:20.331
Sure.

52:20.671 --> 52:22.633
Why is a chicken across the road?

52:22.734 --> 52:23.434
Why?

52:24.015 --> 52:26.438
To get a hamburger on the street.

52:26.458 --> 52:28.260
Oh, that's silly.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.241
Can you tell them?

52:30.603 --> 52:31.965
I'll hear you a joke.

52:31.985 --> 52:32.325
Tell me.

52:32.726 --> 52:35.429
Why can't it get to when you get a goat?

52:35.829 --> 52:36.810
Talk slow now.

52:37.611 --> 52:40.695
It's goats in a jungle.

52:42.397 --> 52:43.118
I got one.

52:43.537 --> 52:44.738
Are you going to be a ballerina?

52:45.039 --> 52:45.800
Can I tell one?

52:45.840 --> 52:46.100
Sure.

52:47.642 --> 52:50.105
Dingle, dingle, who can it be?

52:51.166 --> 52:51.847
Yeah, that's it?

52:52.587 --> 52:54.630
No, there isn't anything else.

52:55.070 --> 52:59.696
That was just one of my favorite books.

52:59.716 --> 53:01.197
You're going to tell me your story, Nicole?

53:01.558 --> 53:01.858
Sure.

53:02.178 --> 53:02.839
Go ahead.

53:02.859 --> 53:06.283
Once upon a time, there was a king.

53:06.884 --> 53:11.389
The king went to get in, and he went to get in the chair.

53:11.970 --> 53:12.210
Mm-hmm.

53:13.928 --> 53:14.749
That's it?

53:14.769 --> 53:15.890
That's my challenge?

53:15.910 --> 53:16.230
Sure.

53:17.832 --> 53:19.814
Um, I've got a story.

53:19.834 --> 53:20.215
Okay.

53:20.655 --> 53:22.697
Of one of Mother's Goose's poems.

53:23.598 --> 53:25.480
It's about the plumber.

53:26.601 --> 53:29.525
The plumber worked and worked the whole day.

53:30.265 --> 53:30.405
Mm-hmm.

53:30.425 --> 53:32.908
But just because he worked it isn't nice.

53:33.729 --> 53:36.272
Because he was just like birds.

53:36.712 --> 53:37.853
That's a silly story.

53:38.234 --> 53:40.556
Because he wasn't like a bird.

53:40.576 --> 53:42.298
He contained like a bird.

53:43.021 --> 53:46.086
And when he changes like a bird, he changes like a bird.

53:46.106 --> 53:47.248
Is that it?

53:47.268 --> 53:47.949
Yep.

53:49.391 --> 53:49.832
Okay.

53:49.852 --> 53:53.377
Do you hear it?

53:53.718 --> 53:54.058
Go ahead.

53:54.299 --> 53:55.520
Mr. Jingle, Mr. Jingle.

53:55.540 --> 53:57.684
Can you two guys sing a song together?

53:57.704 --> 54:04.194
Yeah, I got all, um, um, um, uh, jingle bells.

54:04.514 --> 54:06.177
Can you sing jingle bells with your sister?

54:06.460 --> 54:10.966
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

54:11.747 --> 54:17.254
All the time it is to ride on a wonder stupid sleigh.

54:17.635 --> 54:21.480
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

54:22.301 --> 54:27.448
All the time it is to ride on a wonder stupid sleigh.

54:27.468 --> 54:28.709
It's not a stupid sleigh.

54:29.390 --> 54:30.732
One must open sleigh.

54:31.092 --> 54:33.816
I'm not open sleigh.

54:33.836 --> 54:33.936
Hey.

54:35.688 --> 54:37.010
Go Red Sox!

54:38.492 --> 54:39.915
Go Red Sox!

54:39.995 --> 54:40.736
Crush the Mets!

54:41.617 --> 54:42.940
Crush the Mets!

54:43.160 --> 54:44.021
Go Patriots!

54:44.262 --> 54:45.043
Squish the fish!

54:45.063 --> 54:47.627
How about that?

54:47.667 --> 54:48.268
Squish the fish?

54:48.328 --> 54:50.912
Can you sing that?

54:51.673 --> 54:53.016
Squish the fish!

54:53.296 --> 54:54.117
Go Lions!

54:55.500 --> 54:58.604
Marry the Bears!

54:58.625 --> 54:58.945
Marry the Bears!

54:59.870 --> 55:03.055
What's going on?

55:03.135 --> 55:05.879
