00:01.381 --> 00:17.366
I've done exactly, old friend, but the book is doing better than I thought it was, especially after, you know, I knew that any place that assigned it to a professional Shakespeare scholar, old-style or neuter review, was going to publish vicious reviews.

00:17.406 --> 00:20.451
So I got really nasty reviews in the Sunday Times Book Review.

00:21.051 --> 00:26.620
I got nasty ones coming, I'm told, in the New York Review of Books and the Washington Post Book World.

00:27.582 --> 00:29.785
I got a very nasty one in the Wall Street Journal.

00:30.710 --> 00:32.332
And so it goes, why count up?

00:32.352 --> 00:35.075
But you know, Nick, it doesn't make any difference.

00:36.577 --> 00:43.165
The book is 12 on this week's bestseller list and 8 on next week's.

00:43.185 --> 00:46.770
So these guys and girls are somehow doing my work for me.

00:47.330 --> 00:52.256
What does this tell you, that a serious book like this can become a bestseller?

00:52.296 --> 00:54.159
Well, that I don't know.

00:54.399 --> 00:56.982
I thought I'd have to think about Nick.

00:57.002 --> 00:59.485
The thing I was talking about tells me that there's a real split.

01:00.022 --> 01:02.665
between people who teach Shakespeare and the general public.

01:04.046 --> 01:09.691
But that's part of the general split between the collapse of our universities and, indeed, the real needs of our undergraduates.

01:09.711 --> 01:13.735
But I don't want to start in on that because I've driven everybody blue in the face about that.

01:14.136 --> 01:24.706
The other thing, well, Shakespeare, he's not regarded by the British as their national treasure, but the truth is he's ours.

01:25.427 --> 01:29.050
I mean, from early 19th century America until now, nonstop,

01:29.620 --> 01:36.967
He has been always the most popular author and the most popular playwright in America, and a staple of our education.

01:37.807 --> 01:44.373
And we seem to have more concern with him today, including television, movies, etc.

01:46.315 --> 01:50.779
But somehow we seem more to be a Shakespearean culture than we ever were before.

01:51.740 --> 01:57.805
When you reflect that this somehow takes place in spite of the decline of deep and serious reading,

01:58.595 --> 02:14.889
in spite of the triumph of the visual media, in spite of the degeneration of the academic faculties of literature, who are particularly atrocious on Shakespeare, who may reduce to, you know, just another Elizabethan Jacobean, are no better and no worse than anybody else.

02:15.570 --> 02:27.640
And besides, in order to properly understand him, you must look at him through Foucault's lenses, or you must look at him through Derrida's lenses, or Karl Marx's lenses, or best of all through, I don't know,

02:27.907 --> 02:29.349
Who's our reigning feminista?

02:30.591 --> 02:31.692
Some Harrigan or other.

02:33.635 --> 02:35.438
I don't pay much attention to them.

02:35.738 --> 02:39.483
No, I don't pay much attention to them either, though they occasionally pay some nasty attention to me.

02:41.266 --> 02:43.309
Why are you such a threat to them, do you think?

02:43.729 --> 02:44.610
Interesting question.

02:44.670 --> 02:45.632
Well, here I am, dear.

02:45.692 --> 02:46.954
I'm 68 years old.

02:48.175 --> 02:49.958
I'm like the unthinkable Molly Brown.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.547
I've been getting, I've been publishing books for 42 years and getting nasty reviews for 42 years.

02:57.742 --> 03:12.596
I've been teaching for forty-five years at Yale and eleven years now simultaneously at NYU, and I've announced to the presidents of both institutions that I intend to be carried out of my last class at one place or the other in a body bag some twenty odd years down the road.

03:13.697 --> 03:25.048
And I simultaneously go around the country proclaiming that it's time to stop this nonsense, both on the right and on the left, and that I want to abolish tenure.

03:25.805 --> 03:28.329
because I see no other way of saving the study of literature.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.032
And, of course, that doesn't make me popular.

03:32.154 --> 03:36.360
And I'm sick of ideology, and I know that the undergraduates everywhere are sick of ideology.

03:39.765 --> 03:40.646
What can one say?

03:40.986 --> 03:45.653
When you get this kind of a response, this kind of, I mean, works of literary criticism,

03:46.139 --> 03:47.981
I mean, it's almost an oxymoron.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.583
It's supposed to be bestsellers.

03:50.024 --> 03:51.686
Well, but I've done it before.

03:51.806 --> 03:52.487
You've done it before.

03:52.507 --> 03:55.191
The Book of Jane was purely... Something resonates here.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.774
Purely a work of literary criticism.

03:57.794 --> 03:58.695
It was a bestseller.

03:59.577 --> 04:03.341
The Western Canon was not a New York Times bestseller, but it made bestseller lists.

04:03.482 --> 04:04.903
It was a national bestseller.

04:05.664 --> 04:09.369
And now this one has immediately hit the New York Times bestseller list.

04:09.389 --> 04:11.071
It's quite a bad review in the New York Times.

04:13.314 --> 04:15.297
I've been on the scene an awful long time here.

04:15.738 --> 04:16.078
You know.

04:16.328 --> 04:19.452
Don't you think that in a... I mean, I was a book review editor for a number of years.

04:19.672 --> 04:25.520
I think it's almost like by picking... When they pick the reviewers, it's almost like they want somebody to take a whack at you.

04:25.580 --> 04:25.820
Oh, sure.

04:26.161 --> 04:27.543
I mean, this guy was predictable.

04:27.923 --> 04:28.364
Oh, sure.

04:28.404 --> 04:34.552
Just looking at this guy's credentials, we knew that right off the bat he's going to harm his life and he's coming at you.

04:34.572 --> 04:34.892
Oh, sure.

04:35.333 --> 04:39.659
But, you know, it doesn't do any harm because who's going to believe him?

04:40.379 --> 04:41.521
His fellow academics.

04:43.223 --> 04:44.585
But the book isn't written for them.

04:44.805 --> 04:46.167
I told them not to buy it.

04:46.703 --> 04:54.595
I say right out in the book, I said, I don't want this book to be read by anybody who teaches Shakespeare now in the English-speaking world.

04:54.996 --> 05:06.974
I don't want it to be read by anybody who's part of the school of resentments, you know, if you're a feminist, if you're a Marxist so-called, feminist so-called too, I should say feminist rather than feminist.

05:07.395 --> 05:15.327
If you're a new historicist, which is the lowest of the low, you know, if you're a Greenblatian thug, you can put that in too.

05:16.454 --> 05:18.477
Uh, don't read this book.

05:18.677 --> 05:19.458
It's not for you.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.865
My friend John Holland, a quite wonderful man, you know Johnny?

05:24.866 --> 05:27.470
I gave Johnny this book to read in manuscript.

05:28.051 --> 05:28.832
He's a generous man.

05:28.852 --> 05:30.334
He suggested a number of improvements.

05:31.996 --> 05:33.578
I said, Johnny, say something to me about it.

05:34.219 --> 05:37.164
He said, I said, John, say something.

05:37.404 --> 05:38.606
He said, very impressive book.

05:39.988 --> 05:40.649
I said, it's not all.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.052
He said, well, Harold, he said,

05:43.623 --> 05:47.246
Every really good book on Shakespeare is written by one of our major Shakespearean characters.

05:47.286 --> 05:49.268
There's no question who wrote this book.

05:49.288 --> 05:50.890
I said, all right, Sir John Bloomstaff.

05:51.010 --> 05:51.710
He said, okay.

05:52.491 --> 06:02.800
But then I was talking to my old friend, an old student, Sherb Marks, who's also John's old student, who teaches out at Bloomington, a very smart guy who writes about the Bible and literature and so on.

06:02.821 --> 06:07.625
And he said he bought the book, and he's had time to just read the chapter on that, including Patrick.

06:08.245 --> 06:11.048
I said, in a very different spirit than I say it to the others, I said,

06:11.298 --> 06:12.439
It's not a book for you, Herb.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.560
You're not going to learn anything about it.

06:13.580 --> 06:24.913
He said, Harold, he said, I'm very moved by reading the chapter on Antony and Cleopatra because it reminded me of why I had become a student of literature and decided to go to graduate school in the first place.

06:25.674 --> 06:26.735
I said, that's very sweet of you.

06:27.556 --> 06:31.260
And then he said, I was talking to John about this, and John got off a great remark.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.361
I said, what did John say?

06:32.982 --> 06:38.908
John said, this book was set Shakespeare criticism back a hundred years.

06:41.065 --> 06:45.149
I think that's a great compliment, because that's exactly what I've tried to do.

06:45.169 --> 07:05.568
I've tried to say, let's get away from all this garbage about social energies and feminism and economic determinism and multiculturalism, you know, with Caliban as the hero, the tempest.

07:05.849 --> 07:10.313
Let's get away from all this garbage once and for all, let's remind ourselves

07:10.985 --> 07:14.390
not only why these plays matter, are you comfortable?

07:14.410 --> 07:21.099
But where after all we came from, you know, it's not up to us to make Shakespeare relevant or more relevant.

07:23.121 --> 07:25.525
He got there before us and he's still waiting up ahead of us.

07:26.206 --> 07:28.849
He made us up in the first place.

07:28.869 --> 07:30.331
We have no independence from him.

07:31.112 --> 07:37.701
It's ridiculous to think that we have an option in this matter.

07:40.617 --> 07:47.825
Human beings of our sort didn't fully exist before Shakespeare invented them.

07:48.946 --> 07:55.053
And the ultimate value, I think the real reason, yes, this is the best writer in the world, true.

07:55.073 --> 07:58.717
I don't know anybody in any language I'm able to read who writes better prose or better verse.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.001
Yes, this guy is smarter than anybody in the world.

08:02.061 --> 08:09.409
I can't think of any writer in any discipline who's got an intellect as original and creative and fresh and strong as this one.

08:09.912 --> 08:13.457
Yes, this fellow practically invented the English language as we have it now.

08:13.937 --> 08:16.200
But all that doesn't really matter.

08:16.601 --> 08:24.592
What really matters about Shakespeare is that he invented personality in our sense of personality.

08:25.132 --> 08:31.020
He invented men and women who don't change because their relationship to God or the gods have changed.

08:31.721 --> 08:37.489
He invented men and women who change because they overhear something that they themselves are saying

08:38.093 --> 08:46.382
and are terribly struck and moved by it, and the complex metamorphosis begins to take place in them, in short.

08:46.402 --> 09:00.978
It is a book that you could only have written at this point in your life, so I would never, I would never, dear fellow, have been able to do it before that way.

09:00.998 --> 09:07.645
We're talking about the book at this point, I'm 68, I started writing this

09:09.329 --> 09:16.777
Slowly but surely, I wrote other things in between after I nearly died at the age of 60 from a bleeding ulcer.

09:17.258 --> 09:17.858
You know, I hate this.

09:17.918 --> 09:20.141
I think my wife may be trying to get in touch with me when I give up.

09:20.161 --> 09:21.382
But I don't know how to answer the phone.

09:21.863 --> 09:23.644
Next time I'll try to answer how to answer.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.406
Yeah, but how do you first answer these phones?

09:26.327 --> 09:26.948
I can't figure it out.

09:26.968 --> 09:31.653
Well, I guess if there's a button ringing on line one, line one, you push that button.

09:31.853 --> 09:32.614
Oh, I see.

09:32.934 --> 09:33.355
We'll try.

09:33.395 --> 09:33.835
We'll see.

09:33.855 --> 09:34.776
That's what I didn't do.

09:35.557 --> 09:35.878
We'll see.

09:35.898 --> 09:37.159
You know, I just pick up a phone.

09:37.932 --> 09:39.233
Never mind.

09:39.253 --> 09:46.120
Whoever it was, we'll forget.

09:46.140 --> 09:46.560
I'm 68.

09:46.620 --> 09:51.225
I wrote the final version of this book after I turned 65.

09:51.485 --> 09:56.430
That's what I always used to tell people, Nick.

09:57.370 --> 10:01.134
I've been teaching now for 45 years ago.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.437
I'm a lifelong teacher.

10:06.219 --> 10:07.500
I began by teaching

10:07.902 --> 10:09.824
Blake and Shelley and the Romantic poets.

10:10.565 --> 10:16.713
And then I taught modern poetry, and I taught 19th century poetry and American poetry, and I taught other stuff.

10:17.814 --> 10:20.778
But what I always wanted to do was teach Shakespeare when I felt ready.

10:21.519 --> 10:34.716
And about 22 or 23 years ago, when I guess I was about 44 or 45, I started to teach Shakespeare almost all the time at Yale, you know, three out of my core courses.

10:35.116 --> 10:35.817
How do you mean ready?

10:37.771 --> 10:38.813
Intellectually ready?

10:38.833 --> 10:39.914
Experientially ready.

10:40.115 --> 10:46.885
I'm not a formalist critic, and I'm certainly not a theoretical critic, and I'm certainly not an ideological critic.

10:47.325 --> 10:55.097
I'm an experiential and intuitive critic, like my great heroes Samuel Johnson and William Hassan.

10:55.298 --> 10:56.099
I had to mature.

10:57.261 --> 11:01.146
I had to be emotionally and not just intellectually ready.

11:02.068 --> 11:05.533
I had to learn more about myself and more about other men and other women.

11:06.475 --> 11:08.437
before I could properly teach Shakespeare.

11:09.358 --> 11:12.261
And then it took more than 20 years of teaching Shakespeare.

11:13.042 --> 11:16.246
I wrote some odds and ends about Shakespeare and edited some anthology and so on.

11:17.167 --> 11:27.078
But it took until I was past 65 before I could put in the two years of hard writing that produced this book.

11:27.158 --> 11:28.940
I just wasn't ready until then.

11:30.862 --> 11:35.908
I don't know, that got me smarter or any dumber.

11:38.167 --> 11:38.928
What shall I say?

11:39.269 --> 11:40.510
Well, let me just interrupt for a second.

11:40.571 --> 11:42.734
You mentioned to me in a previous interview... I had to grow up a little.

11:42.934 --> 11:46.519
...in a previous interview that you know these plays from memory.

11:46.820 --> 11:47.200
Yeah.

11:47.220 --> 11:57.796
I now know, I think, even the handful that aren't terribly good, like the three Henry VI plays and the Two Judgment of Around the Earth and so on, pretty much by heart.

11:58.337 --> 12:00.560
So can you see the ones that I really know best?

12:01.341 --> 12:07.110
Of the 38 or 39 Shakespearean plays, 24 or 25 are, I think, multiple pieces.

12:07.681 --> 12:09.583
And those I really know inside and out.

12:10.203 --> 12:26.338
And of course, when you get to know something that well, the nuances of it, the subtleties of it, the deep well that is in it, begins to come up for you, you know.

12:26.358 --> 12:29.220
You begin to have some sense of what maybe you have overlooked.

12:29.801 --> 12:36.827
As I got fascinated, and I wish I had spent more time on what I call Shakespeare's ellipses, which I also call foregrounded.

12:37.398 --> 12:41.984
The stuff he leaves out, and the stuff which nevertheless you have to infer.

12:42.724 --> 12:45.528
And he surely makes it possible for you to infer it.

12:46.569 --> 12:48.632
That's interesting, you end the book with that.

12:49.673 --> 12:49.913
Yeah.

12:50.954 --> 12:53.357
Well, I didn't mean to end the book with that.

12:53.898 --> 13:07.354
I meant to begin the book with that, but my editor, who was very worried about the book being too highfalutin for the readers I wanted to read, since I want common readers and common playgoers

13:08.380 --> 13:10.863
I want the ordinary, ah, love is a Shakespeare.

13:12.205 --> 13:13.186
She said, that's too hard.

13:13.206 --> 13:14.347
That's the hardest thing in the book.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.288
We'll put it at the very end.

13:16.049 --> 13:17.191
So I wasn't going to argue with her.

13:17.571 --> 13:18.412
I didn't think it was too hard.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.034
Well, no, I like it.

13:20.054 --> 13:20.655
No.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.596
It's new for me.

13:21.936 --> 13:23.598
He put it at the very end.

13:23.618 --> 13:29.185
So I said at the beginning of the book, well, it can be read in conjunction with any chapter whatsoever.

13:29.906 --> 13:31.428
And it just happens to be stationed there.

13:32.209 --> 13:35.653
Interesting to me that Falstaff,

13:35.819 --> 14:01.687
I think in the end I have to choose between the ultimate Shakespearean characters, Falstaff, Hamlet, Rosalind, Cleopatra, Othellax and King Lear, Lear the Four, Edgar and Edmund, Iago.

14:03.269 --> 14:04.290
Overwhelmingly,

14:05.738 --> 14:14.351
They seem to me, Macbeth, they seem to me on a higher ridge than anyone else.

14:15.693 --> 14:27.491
And finally, if one has to, you know, I love the fact that Frank Budge and his friend once said to James Joyce, Mr. Joyce, if you had to go to the proverbial desert island, could take any one book, you know how it goes.

14:28.232 --> 14:33.400
And Joyce said, probably, as he presented Shakespeare, he said,

14:35.995 --> 14:41.002
I would like to say that I would take Dante, but it isn't true.

14:41.823 --> 14:44.928
I would take the Englishman, because he is richer.

14:47.331 --> 14:48.332
Very begrudging.

14:48.853 --> 14:52.078
The richness is, well, at T.S.

14:52.098 --> 14:53.199
Eliot's not the same way.

14:53.219 --> 14:57.926
Even he had to find to acknowledge that the Englishman was richer than the Italian.

14:59.188 --> 15:02.172
I say I would take Falstaff over Hamlet, because while

15:03.181 --> 15:10.431
Forstaff is transcendentally, I mean, Hamlet is transcendentally infinite.

15:10.451 --> 15:19.764
Forstaff is astonishingly infinite, and in the mode of imminence, you know, with an A, an overwhelming presence, the real presence.

15:19.784 --> 15:25.813
Indeed, I propose in the book, at one point, you may remember this, that we establish an international holiday.

15:26.182 --> 15:43.247
to celebrate the resurrection of John Thornton when he jumps up from playing dead on the battlefield, and that in honor of Sir John on that day we wear holsters with bottles of sherry in the holsters.

15:43.387 --> 15:47.112
Interesting, do you think that Shakespeare reluctantly killed him off?

15:47.633 --> 15:49.616
Oh, he certainly did.

15:50.057 --> 15:53.742
He says, first of all, not even Hamlet, nobody.

15:54.329 --> 15:59.134
was ever the sensation with London audiences that Falstaff was.

15:59.614 --> 16:01.116
Falstaff swept the boards.

16:01.856 --> 16:16.131
So he not only did the second part of Henry IV, but as you'll remember, he promises in the final scene, the epilogue of Henry IV, that he'll next do Henry V, where he will take Sir John to Agincourt and show him there.

16:16.791 --> 16:19.874
And then I think he realizes, my God, I can't write the play if I do that.

16:20.415 --> 16:21.636
One of two things will happen.

16:21.886 --> 16:39.145
Either this heroic battle will be fought, then it'll return to the Battle of Shrewsbury again, with Falstaff marching through, making fun of the whole thing, to the fury of Henry V. Or, Henry V, not content, the bastard, with hanging Bardock, think of the horror of hanging Sir John Falstaff.

16:40.947 --> 16:41.768
Can we imagine it?

16:41.929 --> 16:45.012
Could an audience fit through the hanging of Sir John Falstaff?

16:45.753 --> 16:45.973
No.

16:46.113 --> 16:49.497
So you get that heartbreaking, that marvelous,

16:50.152 --> 16:59.564
prose speech of Mistress Quickly in Henry V, describing the death of Genov.

16:59.584 --> 17:01.306
But it was offstage, of course.

17:01.326 --> 17:02.208
It is offstage.

17:02.228 --> 17:05.372
No, you do not see the great man die onstage.

17:05.972 --> 17:10.458
You wonder when he was writing these histories in Falstaff, of course he was Old Castle to begin with.

17:10.879 --> 17:11.980
Does Shakespeare have a clue?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.462
Are you talking about inventing the human?

17:13.722 --> 17:14.103
No.

17:14.323 --> 17:17.307
I think when he originally wrote Old Castle,

17:19.058 --> 17:20.840
I think Oldcastle ran away from him.

17:21.561 --> 17:23.864
I mean, Shylock, to some extent, had run away from him.

17:24.545 --> 17:30.372
I think if I write about Hamlet and believing that this is a Hamlet he had first written a long time before, that ran away from him.

17:30.392 --> 17:35.758
I think Falkenbridge the Bastard ran away from him in King John.

17:36.559 --> 17:39.242
But Falstaff didn't just run away from him.

17:39.262 --> 17:47.412
I mean, Falstaff must have shocked Shakespeare, shocked and delighted him.

17:48.556 --> 17:59.688
The overflowing excess of it, the sheer abelions of it, the magnificence of it, the endlessness of it, I think must have intoxicated Shakespeare.

18:00.109 --> 18:01.651
And this is supposed to be a history play, too.

18:01.891 --> 18:03.012
It's no history play.

18:03.593 --> 18:17.128
It is a great tragicomedy, and I fiercely reject what the scholars do when they call that whole series of four plays the Henriad, starting with Richard II and ending with Henry V. No, the two plays in the middle

18:17.547 --> 18:31.643
which are one play taken there, that ten-act marvelous play, which I think is, maybe with the exception of Anthony and Cleopatra, maybe Shakespeare's best single play, the two parts of Henry IV together, that's the Falstaff he had to play.

18:31.723 --> 18:33.926
That's the Johns play.

18:35.167 --> 18:46.440
I'd never gotten over seeing a Ralph Richardson play the part when I was a kid, and I haven't seen many first-rate Falstaff since, but a first-rate Falstaff holds the stage

18:46.842 --> 18:48.044
And it really doesn't matter.

18:48.124 --> 18:51.709
I mean, Hotspur, in some other play, would amount to something.

18:51.829 --> 18:53.772
But in Henry IV, part 1, what does it matter?

18:54.513 --> 18:55.174
He has another chance.

18:56.155 --> 19:00.341
You just sit around and patiently waiting for Falstaff to come bellowing on again.

19:02.785 --> 19:06.690
Extraordinary creation, really.

19:07.227 --> 19:09.450
I myself, of course, have totally identified.

19:09.530 --> 19:13.394
At the very end, you knew King Richard yourself.

19:13.414 --> 19:23.306
I knew there's a parody of the horrible anti-Semitic Graziano, the Joel Stryker type character in A Loud Mouth in The Merchant of Aniston.

19:23.346 --> 19:25.328
I'm a parody of Sir John Foster.

19:25.348 --> 19:26.429
That's wonderful.

19:28.212 --> 19:32.897
Almost daily, I say to some friend, frequently a young one, male or female,

19:33.350 --> 19:39.357
in the mood of Sir John, speaking to Hal, when I find the eradication, I say, May God forgive thee, so and so.

19:39.757 --> 19:42.700
Before I knew thee, I knew nothing.

19:42.721 --> 19:46.785
And now to speak truly am I become little better than is one of the wicked.

19:47.506 --> 19:51.610
Do you think that had Marlowe lived, that he would have been the equal to Shakespeare?

19:51.630 --> 19:52.552
I'm not sure.

19:53.252 --> 19:53.473
No.

19:53.513 --> 19:55.275
He was ahead of Shakespeare at that point in his life.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.177
He was certainly ahead of Shakespeare at that point in his life.

19:57.877 --> 20:01.922
But, no, Marlowe couldn't write comedy and wasn't interested in writing comedy.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.564
And Marlowe, Marlowe doesn't really progress, you know.

20:06.664 --> 20:19.858
As you go from the two parts of Tamburlaine through the massacre of Harris, I'm sorry, on to Dr. Faustus and Edward II, Marlowe doesn't change.

20:20.999 --> 20:22.701
Marlowe doesn't change.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.983
I know that's the age of 29, so Marlowe doesn't develop.

20:25.003 --> 20:26.224
Yeah, but he wouldn't have developed.

20:27.165 --> 20:31.690
It was a very great but very narrow genius, and he wasn't interested in people.

20:32.547 --> 20:36.491
I mean, his creatures are cartoons, the way Johnson's creatures are cartoons.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.614
His poetry's beautiful, I have to say.

20:39.734 --> 20:49.203
Astonishing Ovidian poet, a wonderful dramatic poet, terrific writer, and obviously a major problem for Shakespeare.

20:50.344 --> 21:00.394
I think I sort of featured that all through the book, but I don't believe, you know, the African scholar's old style do always scream, where's the evidence, where's the evidence, come on.

21:01.150 --> 21:07.237
No way that those two guys were rivals on the London stage, a small group of people, and they didn't know one another.

21:07.877 --> 21:10.160
I think Shakespeare was terrified of him.

21:10.220 --> 21:14.805
He was a ruffian, he was a cutthroat, he was a counter spy, he was a violent man.

21:14.865 --> 21:16.948
None of that would have suited Shakespeare.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.931
He does pay tribute to him, though, in a play.

21:20.131 --> 21:22.514
Oh, he pays quite a tribute to him.

21:23.575 --> 21:28.781
After he's dead, and... All sorts of things are possible with that point of question.

21:28.801 --> 21:30.803
And many things are complex, because

21:31.424 --> 21:42.200
Though this is also, I'll rate some reviewers, I really think that in a complex way in King Lear, Edmund is not so much a Marloweian character as he is Marlowe.

21:42.220 --> 21:51.614
Just as I think in a very, very much more complicated way, Edgar, who's the most fascinating character in the play, has something of Shakespeare himself in him.

21:51.634 --> 22:00.908
It interests me that you also suggest that perhaps other than reading plays, which you suggest as the primary exercise,

22:01.394 --> 22:11.084
That instead of performing them, perhaps, that was a kind of hit on my part, which infuriated my old friend Robert Brustein, and it infuriates all theatrical people.

22:11.104 --> 22:19.653
But Shakespeare is now played so badly by ideologically-driven high-concept directors who mostly politicize it and multiculturalize it and so on.

22:20.974 --> 22:22.616
I don't want to go to these things anymore.

22:22.716 --> 22:31.165
I would much rather go and hear really good actors, you know, sit down in a chair, get up from a chair, and give a good public reading of Shakespeare.

22:31.752 --> 22:41.146
But, unless I'm a minority of one, I do it as a protest, but I know very well it's not going to happen.

22:42.507 --> 22:47.014
I know that my daughters and I read there of an age.

22:47.194 --> 22:52.021
We read the plays together, and it is really a great collaborative experience.

22:52.121 --> 22:58.791
And as you say, you're a director, you're a stage manager, you're all of these things together, and reading.

22:59.492 --> 23:01.675
But it is interesting, and you do address yourself to this.

23:02.363 --> 23:05.306
Shakespeare's apparent indifference to publishing his own works.

23:05.366 --> 23:07.868
No, I think it was only apparent.

23:07.888 --> 23:11.952
He couldn't get a nickel from it, and he was a man always interested in the next showing.

23:13.153 --> 23:26.265
But he knew, he authorized a lot of these quartos, and he knew all about the unauthorized ones, and that meant that thousands of people who came to these plays, which were always in repertory and being played, knew the text.

23:26.925 --> 23:30.008
Because there are certain things he does with Sir John Paul's stuff

23:30.410 --> 23:32.292
that nobody could take in through the year.

23:32.552 --> 23:42.604
I showed that with this brilliant use he makes of the parable of Deves and the leaper Lazarus in Falstaff.

23:43.765 --> 23:54.317
The fact that Falstaff is obsessed with this particular parable in the Gospel of Luke.

23:54.337 --> 23:58.982
I think again and again, it's one of those shivolts about Shakespeare, you know, that these are just

23:59.755 --> 24:02.418
you know, scripts for interpretation.

24:02.559 --> 24:06.804
No, no, they're not.

24:06.824 --> 24:07.145
No, they're not.

24:07.165 --> 24:09.448
They're this and they're that, but there's always something more.

24:10.429 --> 24:11.490
There's always something more.

24:11.991 --> 24:17.338
So it is your view that he wrote to be read, both.

24:17.358 --> 24:24.728
I think he wrote to be seen, to have auditors, to be played, always, yes.

24:25.649 --> 24:27.231
And that was the bulk of the audience.

24:27.582 --> 24:31.428
But I think also he was writing to be read by a smaller audience.

24:31.448 --> 24:33.972
So he unquestionably, in your view, considered this literature?

24:37.397 --> 24:38.338
Oh, yes.

24:38.418 --> 24:42.765
That's quite a question in those days, in terms of, you know, stuff we've written.

24:42.785 --> 24:53.260
Is René Ben-Johnson published the works of Penn-Johnson News and helped edit the folios?

24:53.300 --> 24:55.884
You point out— We don't know, of course.

24:55.904 --> 24:57.066
We don't know.

24:59.037 --> 25:06.126
Think of that great speech of the player King, which is clearly written by Hamlet and inserted into the play, part of which I quote at the very end of it.

25:06.146 --> 25:07.568
It's one of the epigraphs of the book.

25:08.729 --> 25:12.234
No way that an audience can take that in through the ear.

25:12.995 --> 25:16.399
Twenty-six or twenty-seven densely packed metaphysical lines.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.081
You can't take that in.

25:18.461 --> 25:20.444
And that's usually cut out of performance, isn't it?

25:20.464 --> 25:21.065
Yeah, terribly.

25:21.085 --> 25:23.548
And it's in some ways the heart of the play.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.952
We're orderly to end where I've begun.

25:28.062 --> 25:31.968
Our wills and fates do so contrary run.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.572
But our devices still are overthrown.

25:34.732 --> 25:36.074
Our thoughts are ours.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.057
Their ends.

25:38.077 --> 25:41.442
None of our of them.

25:41.462 --> 25:41.803
That's wonderful.

25:41.823 --> 25:46.490
Going back to, we were talking about how you know 25 of these from memory.

25:46.510 --> 25:48.112
And yet, obviously, you still read them.

25:48.753 --> 25:48.873
Oh.

25:49.615 --> 25:53.260
First of all, I go through every year teaching them again.

25:54.826 --> 25:56.768
I taught major for major last week.

25:56.848 --> 25:59.672
Because of the National Book Awards, I can't teach my class next week.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.856
But after that, I'll teach the last class of the year after Thanksgiving.

26:03.637 --> 26:09.564
And then we'll do two hours, one hour, and also other dance where on the other aren't much ado about nothing.

26:09.624 --> 26:12.688
I will certainly reread the plays again before I teach them.

26:13.028 --> 26:14.830
But do you always get something new with every reading?

26:14.851 --> 26:15.551
Of course.

26:15.571 --> 26:16.232
How could you not?

26:17.874 --> 26:23.341
It's not possible, I think, to look at a single remark of false steps and not get something new.

26:23.361 --> 26:24.242
There's always more.

26:25.049 --> 26:28.853
When did you hit on this idea of the invention of the human?

26:28.873 --> 26:30.335
That's interesting, Nick.

26:30.355 --> 26:45.612
I had originally, though I adore Dr. Johnson above all critics, and his preference to Shakespeare is going to be a crucial thing, if I had to vote for a single book in English of the highest quality on Shakespeare, it would be William Hazlitt's The Character That Shakespeare Plays.

26:45.632 --> 26:49.337
And I've been giving a course all these 20-odd years called Shakespeare and Originality.

26:49.717 --> 26:54.162
So this book was going to be called Shakespeare and Originality, and the subtitle was going to be

26:54.462 --> 26:56.264
the characters of Shakespeare's plays.

26:56.965 --> 27:02.854
But I stopped myself one day and I said, Harold, first of all, it isn't really about Shakespeare and originality.

27:03.735 --> 27:07.600
It's really a book about Shakespeare because it's even got a kind of hidden biography of Shakespeare in it.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.304
So I said, all right, the book is Shakespeare.

27:10.885 --> 27:12.227
But then I said, well, what's the subtitle?

27:12.247 --> 27:15.111
You can't just say Shakespeare by Harold Bloom.

27:15.131 --> 27:17.173
And I said, well, what matters most about him?

27:17.915 --> 27:23.322
And what's the most polemical thing I have to say and the thing that drives them all crazy and what an effect?

27:24.162 --> 27:27.286
to be pragmatic about it is the hook for the book.

27:28.568 --> 27:31.812
In every sense, it's the invention of the human.

27:31.832 --> 27:35.377
So the book became Shakespeare, the invention of the human.

27:35.397 --> 27:37.159
Can you imagine life without Shakespeare?

27:37.540 --> 27:39.803
He was the one stabbed in the eye at the age of 29.

27:39.863 --> 27:40.624
No, no.

27:41.204 --> 27:42.286
I talk about that in the book.

27:42.726 --> 27:45.049
I would say his work would have ended with Richard III.

27:45.690 --> 27:50.777
And I think not only would subsequent literature be very different,

27:51.230 --> 27:52.432
But we would be different.

27:52.452 --> 27:53.853
The language would be different.

27:53.893 --> 27:55.375
The way we think would be different.

27:55.455 --> 27:57.037
Our personalities would be different.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.881
Cultural history would be different.

28:00.822 --> 28:04.106
Probably other aspects of history would be very different.

28:04.126 --> 28:11.856
No secular author has so influenced the world, both Western and Eastern, as Shakespeare has.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.038
No secular author.

28:13.378 --> 28:17.243
The only possible rivals are the authors of the great scriptures.

28:17.564 --> 28:21.068
You know, the authors of the Hebrew Bible...

28:21.689 --> 28:39.588
the authors of the New Testament, the author or authors of the Koran, the authors of the Great Eastern, you know, Indian and Persian and Chinese scriptures, they have influenced the world more perhaps even than Shakespeare has.

28:39.648 --> 28:41.650
But I wonder if that's always going to be true.

28:42.931 --> 28:49.738
I think if the world is going to have a coming culture, and increasingly it does, that culture is going to be Shakespearean.

28:50.663 --> 28:52.105
Did you pick the jacket art for this?

28:52.225 --> 28:52.445
No.

28:52.846 --> 28:54.188
That's a very interesting story.

28:54.368 --> 28:55.650
It was a mistake on my part.

28:56.150 --> 29:01.397
I did not want any jacket, because I couldn't find an image comprehensive enough for Shakespeare.

29:01.818 --> 29:02.879
I just wanted lettering.

29:03.981 --> 29:08.687
The publisher, Susan Peterson, overruled me.

29:09.288 --> 29:11.911
I was in Cambridge University.

29:12.993 --> 29:19.962
I was in the lobby of the hotel there, sitting around with a bunch of people, including the editor of the book.

29:20.903 --> 29:29.195
Cindy Spiegel, about to give a lecture at my alma mater, Pembroke College, for his 650th anniversary, on Shakespeare.

29:30.457 --> 29:35.445
And Cindy came in with eight or nine micro-anthema reproductions.

29:35.465 --> 29:41.394
She said, Harold, Susan, that's the publisher, insists you get to pick one of these eight or nine.

29:41.734 --> 29:43.657
And she said, no, no, Harold.

29:44.358 --> 29:45.300
We know what we're doing.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.942
The art director wants us.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.885
Just pick one of the eight or nine.

29:49.979 --> 29:53.664
I looked at them, I fell in love with the Delphic Sybil.

29:53.684 --> 29:58.291
I didn't pick her because she's the Delphic Sybil, but because I thought she was the sexiest.

29:58.351 --> 30:03.678
With those huge eyes, she must have reminded me of my boyhood love, Sophia Loren.

30:03.879 --> 30:04.640
Mine as well.

30:04.660 --> 30:06.062
So I picked it up.

30:06.082 --> 30:06.883
She's so gorgeous.

30:07.484 --> 30:08.605
So I picked it for that.

30:08.705 --> 30:09.286
That's lovely.

30:09.386 --> 30:09.787
I like it.

30:09.807 --> 30:13.472
The story goes with the photograph and back to the book.

30:13.655 --> 30:15.017
I think you have a proof copy there.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.680
Actually, I have a finished copy.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.682
A finished copy.

30:19.382 --> 30:31.518
A very nice young lady, a photography student at Yale who was in my course, Catherine Newbigin, made two very fine photographs of me.

30:32.059 --> 30:36.384
My wife chose one in which I looked rather gentle and sweet and was writing away.

30:36.424 --> 30:39.949
And then there was one in which I looked rather like Sir John Polestar.

30:40.638 --> 30:43.562
So my wife said, you send that one in to the publisher.

30:44.303 --> 30:47.227
And I said, well, let me send both in and let them choose.

30:47.247 --> 30:50.531
She said, no, Harold, they'll choose the more aggressive looking one.

30:50.551 --> 30:53.175
And she's still angry at me because they chose the John Bloom stuff.

30:53.195 --> 30:54.336
That's funny.

30:54.356 --> 30:57.681
But I guess they thought it was better for commercial purposes.

30:58.142 --> 31:00.945
Show them the pugnacious old fellow.

31:00.965 --> 31:01.326
It's a great book.

31:01.726 --> 31:06.272
I want the full spelling of the name, even though I have known the spelling for years.

31:06.613 --> 31:06.713
Okay.

31:07.267 --> 31:08.489
B-A-R-B-A-S.

31:08.929 --> 31:09.470
B-A-S.

31:09.550 --> 31:10.271
B-A-N-E-S.

31:10.531 --> 31:10.852
Ah, uh-huh.

31:10.972 --> 31:11.793
I'm glad to get it right.

31:11.873 --> 31:12.934
It is great, didn't it?

31:12.954 --> 31:13.375
B-A-S.

31:13.515 --> 31:14.656
B-A-N-E-S.

31:15.117 --> 31:15.357
Nicholas.

31:15.578 --> 31:16.319
Ah, it's B-A-S.

31:16.339 --> 31:16.479
Uh-huh.

31:16.499 --> 31:16.859
Very glad I asked.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.702
So, this is for Nick.

31:19.583 --> 31:20.564
What do you prefer, Nicholas?

31:20.584 --> 31:21.425
Ah, Nick is fine.

31:22.046 --> 31:22.827
This is for Nick.

31:23.688 --> 31:24.649
Scroll that again.

31:24.669 --> 31:25.350
B-A-S.

31:25.611 --> 31:26.331
B-A-S.

31:27.693 --> 31:29.696
B-A-N-E-S.

31:30.156 --> 31:35.303
Yes.

31:35.323 --> 31:36.885
Well, it's a very unusual name.

31:37.287 --> 31:42.975
I was in Greece last week, in Turkey, in Egypt, working on my new book.

31:45.539 --> 32:06.568
I have a book now called How to Read and Why, and I think it'll be a good book, a short book, maybe 200 pages, which I hope can even wind up in one of its ones that's a mass-market paperback, trying to tell people how you ought to read poems and plays and novels and parables and stories and so on, and why you ought to read, why it's important to read, why it's important for you to read.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.721
And after that, if I live, I'd like to write more books.

32:09.781 --> 32:14.986
But I'm sad because I guess this is my book.

32:15.467 --> 32:15.907
This one?

32:15.927 --> 32:16.888
Yeah, it's God Falls.

32:18.350 --> 32:21.053
Because I wanted it to be useful.

32:21.113 --> 32:25.518
Above all else, I wanted it to be a companion for ordinary playgoers and ordinary readers.

32:26.198 --> 32:29.202
I knew that that meant you couldn't just say things once, you know.

32:29.722 --> 32:35.188
Because I don't expect that most people could or should want to read the entire book necessarily at one time.

32:35.776 --> 32:38.460
I think they will want to dip in and read a chapter at a time.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.844
So I repeated a great deal of stuff.

32:40.864 --> 32:43.268
So there's a lot of incremental repetition in the book.

32:44.009 --> 33:03.420
Even though I tried to curb myself in terms of my enemies, the theory gang, the school of resentment, love feminists, and the social energy boys and girls, and what I call the sex and power freaks, the gender and power freaks,

33:04.075 --> 33:07.019
I tried to keep it up, but I just couldn't.

33:07.039 --> 33:10.404
You know, it's not the staple of the book.

33:10.964 --> 33:18.134
I really do concentrate on the plays, and sometimes for 20 or 30 pages at a time, I can forget these varlets, but it always comes back to me again.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.157
I really am so outraged.

33:20.978 --> 33:23.562
And besides, I knew I was going to be hanged anyway.

33:24.763 --> 33:30.471
So, as the good book says, it is better to be hanged for a goat than for a sheep.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.767
Here you are nominated for a National Book Award.

33:32.927 --> 33:33.668
I won't get it.

33:33.708 --> 33:34.530
Don't worry about that.

33:34.550 --> 33:35.751
Oh, don't be so surprised.

33:35.791 --> 33:36.412
Oh, no, dear.

33:37.233 --> 33:42.902
Someone who's controversial, I've been nominated for it before, someone who's controversial never gets a National Book Award.

33:42.922 --> 33:51.594
It will go either to that book about the shtefel, surely, you know, a nice pious subject, or it'll go to the book about William Lloyd Garrison, also a pious subject.

33:52.275 --> 34:00.407
It will not go to somebody who many of the reviews, you know, have accused of having bad manners towards feminists, bad manners towards

34:00.809 --> 34:04.774
Younger scholars, so on and so forth, no, no, never give it to me.

34:04.794 --> 34:07.598
No, no, no, no, no.

34:07.618 --> 34:09.080
Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.642
We'll see.

34:10.662 --> 34:11.743
That won't happen.

34:12.224 --> 34:12.945
That won't happen.

34:12.965 --> 34:20.334
You know, you do address yourself to, I forget how precisely you suggest, but Shakespeare's reading has always been problematic.

34:21.135 --> 34:26.422
He's not formally educated, neither is Abraham Lincoln for that matter.

34:26.963 --> 34:27.323
And yet,

34:27.691 --> 34:28.552
He knows everything.

34:28.652 --> 34:29.954
Yeah, he knows everything.

34:29.974 --> 34:31.095
How does that happen to your view?

34:32.777 --> 34:33.158
I don't know.

34:33.178 --> 34:35.961
But you also say that his reading really isn't what forms him, either.

34:35.981 --> 34:36.942
No, it's not his reading.

34:38.104 --> 34:38.905
It's not his reading.

34:40.787 --> 34:44.772
I mean, he made enormous use of his reading.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.073
But he was not an erodite.

34:46.574 --> 34:54.964
He didn't rely upon reading the way I rely upon reading, the way Ben Johnson relied upon reading, or even Marlowe relied upon reading.

34:56.125 --> 34:58.307
He relied on intuition and experience.

35:00.069 --> 35:02.311
And there had to be more intuition than experience.

35:02.791 --> 35:06.274
Here's a guy who spent his life either in London or in Stratford.

35:07.295 --> 35:09.597
Here's a guy who could have traveled abroad but never did.

35:09.637 --> 35:12.199
Here's a guy who never even went to the north.

35:12.219 --> 35:13.240
He never went to Scotland.

35:13.941 --> 35:14.842
Never went into Wales.

35:15.883 --> 35:19.646
He stayed inside his own mind.

35:21.988 --> 35:24.090
Here's an intuitionist, you know, the...

35:24.644 --> 35:28.248
outstanding intuitionist, I think, of all time.

35:28.268 --> 35:30.371
You know, which takes one into the other side of him.

35:32.954 --> 35:42.546
The fascinating thing about him is that though he is determinately secular, he in some sense competes with all the authors of all the religious scriptures.

35:42.906 --> 35:45.610
But he doesn't want to, and probably doesn't intend to.

35:47.111 --> 35:53.419
I see somewhere in there that Hamlet has become the intellectual's Christ, and I think this is true.

35:53.720 --> 36:05.913
Here is someone who did not set out to compete with Plato and Aristotle, and yet who has more cognitive power?

36:07.495 --> 36:14.042
Wittgenstein, Immanuel Kant, Hegel, Plato on the one side, or Shakespeare on the other?

36:17.146 --> 36:22.191
That's why I say early on in the book that I think the proper stance towards him, the way you have to start,

36:23.217 --> 36:24.298
I think it's really important.

36:25.379 --> 36:26.260
Start with awe.

36:27.822 --> 36:30.165
You know, start with awe.

36:31.927 --> 36:45.021
Because without awe, you will start getting into the absurd belief that you know more than he does, or that you can condescend to him, the way this poor resentment condescends to him.

36:45.241 --> 36:46.883
Or I said, oh, he's just another writer.

36:47.343 --> 36:49.866
He isn't just another writer.

36:49.886 --> 36:50.727
He just isn't.

36:52.445 --> 36:53.747
He isn't just another thinker.

36:54.167 --> 36:58.752
He's the outstanding psychologist in human history, Weston or Easton.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.095
He's the outstanding thinker.

37:04.159 --> 37:07.823
I understand you were hammered on Chris Lydon's show today by some psychoanalyst.

37:09.365 --> 37:12.949
I didn't hear it, but I wouldn't say he hammered me.

37:12.969 --> 37:16.173
I sort of turned to the side and said, I ain't going to fight.

37:17.314 --> 37:20.798
But what's their problem, do you think, particularly the Freudian?

37:21.048 --> 37:29.436
Well, because I always say, I said it, I did it in the Western canon, I do it here also, that Freud has no originality.

37:29.476 --> 37:31.699
He's just crucified Shakespeare.

37:31.879 --> 37:32.620
And I think that's true.

37:33.240 --> 37:38.005
Mind you, I don't long to the Fred Cruz, down, down, down, let's get rid of Freud.

37:38.946 --> 37:40.588
Let's forget Freud as a scientist.

37:40.628 --> 37:41.589
He never was one.

37:41.729 --> 37:45.573
Freud is, to the 20th century, what Montaigne was to the Renaissance.

37:46.293 --> 37:47.855
Well, that's honor enough for anybody.

37:48.275 --> 37:49.857
Freud is a great moral essayist.

37:52.064 --> 37:56.752
and in his own way a great interpreter and student of Shakespeare.

37:58.115 --> 38:01.862
But to use Freud to interpret Shakespeare is ridiculous.

38:02.463 --> 38:05.869
As I remarked in that earlier book, a Shakespearean reading of Freud is fun.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.033
A Freudian reading of Shakespeare is a joke.

38:09.636 --> 38:12.200
Shakespearean reading of anything is fun, if you can manage it.

38:13.002 --> 38:14.865
You've described yourself as elastic.

38:15.740 --> 38:17.922
Do you think Shakespeare could qualify in any way?

38:18.963 --> 38:32.658
No, I made clear in the book that while I think there are some Gnostic elements in Lear and in King Lear, that I think Shakespeare doesn't have a religious sensibility at all.

38:35.061 --> 38:39.626
I mean, the Gnosticism comes to that from playing with Renaissance Hermeticism, but no.

38:40.327 --> 38:41.808
I don't think Shakespeare was a Catholic.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.570
I don't think Shakespeare was a Protestant.

38:43.887 --> 38:45.389
I don't think Shakespeare was a Christian.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.030
I don't think he was a non-Christian.

38:47.111 --> 38:48.712
I don't think he was an anti-Christian.

38:49.293 --> 38:52.016
I think he was not interested in religion.

38:52.176 --> 38:56.982
Do you think he believed in anything?

38:57.002 --> 38:57.462
I don't know.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.864
Interesting.

38:58.884 --> 38:59.705
I don't know.

38:59.725 --> 39:01.807
Bleeding ghosts, maybe?

39:03.028 --> 39:05.931
I have no idea what he believed in.

39:05.951 --> 39:09.135
As I remarked somewhere in the book, from reading and rereading Shakespeare,

39:09.638 --> 39:11.480
I can understand certain things about him.

39:11.700 --> 39:18.126
I can understand that he preferred drinking to eating, that he lusted after both genders, and he hated lawyers.

39:18.146 --> 39:19.608
But I can't tell.

39:19.628 --> 39:21.229
I think he really lusted after both genders.

39:21.249 --> 39:27.015
I think he kind of dabbles in the silence he's lusting after a man.

39:28.216 --> 39:36.844
And it returns as a motif in The Merchant of Venice, in the relationship between Antonio and Sebastian in Twelfth Nights,

39:38.444 --> 39:41.689
There are very dark elements of him, and the two noble kinsmen at the end.

39:42.250 --> 39:48.942
There's that strange poem, which the British think Shakespeare didn't write, that elegy for Will Peter, because they say it isn't good enough.

39:49.002 --> 39:52.087
It's not a good poem, but I'm pretty sure it is by Shakespeare.

39:53.329 --> 40:04.468
I think he lusted primarily for women, yes, and left a terrible relationship with his life, was with that famous dark lady of the sonnets.

40:05.613 --> 40:08.997
He was sufficiently universal, so he had the other aspect in him also.

40:10.679 --> 40:23.215
But as to what his politics were, or his religion, or his attitude towards the social issues of the day, he took great care to see that we would know nothing and we don't know.

40:23.235 --> 40:29.623
People who try to prove he's a conservative are just as silly as people who try to prove that he is a liberal or a social reformer.

40:30.805 --> 40:31.806
He isn't any of those things.

40:33.828 --> 40:35.210
What questions would you ask him?

40:35.390 --> 40:37.132
It's a preposterous question.

40:37.192 --> 40:37.873
I could find him?

40:41.237 --> 40:41.337
Yeah.

40:41.357 --> 40:43.300
You said an hour with him like I have an hour with you.

40:43.740 --> 41:00.461
I would say, Mr. Shakespeare, I have surmised, following the name of Peter Alexander, since we cannot find the text of the Orr Hamlet, supposedly by Thomas Kidd, I have surmised that you wrote that first version of Hamlet, and that there are traces of it still left in the final version and elsewhere.

41:00.521 --> 41:01.943
Is that true?

41:01.963 --> 41:03.565
You know, since nobody agrees with me.

41:04.102 --> 41:10.933
I'd like to know whether he wrote the first Hamlet and was making up for it when he wrote this Hamlet.

41:11.133 --> 41:13.096
I guess that's one question I would like to ask him.

41:14.598 --> 41:18.905
Why is that of such overriding importance to you when he wrote the first Hamlet?

41:18.925 --> 41:30.042
Because what they usually say when they talk about grafting problems and revisionary problems in Shakespeare, people like Graham Bradshaw and William Empson, who are very good critics, I think, of Shakespeare,

41:30.511 --> 41:40.066
What they usually say is, well, the special difficulties of the play come from the fact that he's taking kids or Hamlet and trying to work it into his own play.

41:40.527 --> 41:52.806
But how much more fascinating it is if this is right, if it's something that he wrote too early, as it were, and didn't really do a great job on, and now he's coming back to it.

41:53.123 --> 41:56.968
three plays, extraordinary plays, that he wrote within a fourteen-month period.

41:56.988 --> 41:58.389
Oh, that's fascinating.

41:58.950 --> 42:21.156
I think that all are, and who knows, certain composers like Mozart and Bach have had amazing periods, Beetzel and so on, but certainly in the history of literature, just literature, I do not know of anything as uncanny, as weird, as the fact that at fourteen consecutive months, in a year and two months, Shakespeare wrote

42:23.414 --> 42:29.600
King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra in fourteen months.

42:32.643 --> 42:37.808
And he revised King Lear extensively.

42:37.949 --> 42:44.235
King Lear Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra in fourteen consecutive months.

42:44.415 --> 42:45.836
What was burning him, I wonder?

42:45.917 --> 42:46.477
God knows.

42:47.858 --> 42:48.259
I don't know.

42:48.279 --> 42:53.404
I think it did end something in him, because Coriolanus and Simon of Athens are very different plays.

42:53.671 --> 42:56.113
And real tragedy seems to be over for him after that.

42:56.133 --> 42:57.975
Do you think he had a breakdown?

42:58.055 --> 43:00.338
Some people have suggested that he had a nervous breakdown.

43:00.358 --> 43:02.660
I think he had a breakdown and that it was syphilitic.

43:03.401 --> 43:03.721
Really?

43:03.741 --> 43:07.785
And I think it took place at about the time he was writing Two Noble Kinsmen.

43:09.187 --> 43:12.730
And I think that's why he goes home at the end of his life.

43:12.830 --> 43:21.619
That's why the last play is Two Noble Kinsmen, written in 1613, in conjunction with John Fletcher.

43:22.814 --> 43:26.879
And I think in the last two or three-quarter years of his life, Shakespeare didn't write anything.

43:27.680 --> 43:33.687
I think the syphilis and its after-effects had unnerved him terribly, and that he went home to die.

43:34.048 --> 43:40.335
And it must have been very uncomfortable for him, since the relationships between him and Mrs. Shakespeare were never very good.

43:40.896 --> 43:42.898
Where do you draw the surmisel of the syphilis?

43:42.958 --> 43:45.421
I've not seen that before.

43:45.441 --> 43:49.847
Look at the clothes of... which part of the st.

43:49.867 --> 43:50.087
Bethsaida?

43:50.776 --> 43:53.700
the immensely bitter closing speech of Andrus.

43:55.683 --> 44:03.354
Look at all the other places in Shakespeare, with Shakespeare with very many jokes of being made about selfless.

44:03.374 --> 44:20.378
Then there is that tradition which I treasure, that Sir William Davenant, the restoration poet and playwright, insisted throughout his life that he was Shakespeare's fasted natural son, and it is true that Shakespeare had always stayed in this fellow's mother's inn, and she was known as a very

44:20.915 --> 44:25.601
free-spirited lady overnight on his way home, and Davinette was born without a nurse.

44:29.306 --> 44:32.170
But I'm also following my old acquaintance, Tony Burgess.

44:32.770 --> 44:35.394
There are, for me, only two good biographies of Shakespeare.

44:35.534 --> 44:41.161
One is the wonderful novel by Anthony Burgess, a very joicy novel called Nothing Like the Sun.

44:42.062 --> 44:45.907
And the other is, which I really recommend to you if you haven't read it, Nick.

44:46.128 --> 44:46.849
It's a wonderful book.

44:47.109 --> 44:48.431
I think Burgess' best book.

44:49.031 --> 44:50.213
And the other is

44:51.053 --> 45:05.715
A very good, sober, but useful and idiosyncratic, and I talk about it a lot in this book, two-volume biography of Shakespeare by Russell Fraser, which I think did better in bringing the life and the work together than anyone I know.

45:08.279 --> 45:13.787
Burgess also surmised that, suggested that Shakespeare worked on the King James Bible.

45:14.257 --> 45:16.921
Yeah, I remember that so much.

45:17.342 --> 45:18.784
I don't know what the name is.

45:18.924 --> 45:21.007
I met Burgess just a couple of times.

45:21.308 --> 45:22.389
I had breakfast with him one day.

45:23.010 --> 45:25.574
We got along very well, but it was very funny.

45:25.594 --> 45:38.474
He was teaching, I think, at the City University Graduate School in New York, and I was staying a lot with a nice young lady up in the Columbia area.

45:39.635 --> 45:42.660
And I just met him at a party, a faculty party somewhere.

45:43.383 --> 45:45.685
You know, he called me Bloom, I called him Bloom.

45:45.705 --> 45:47.127
We had nice, funny conversations.

45:47.687 --> 45:50.530
I was a great admirer of his Enderby novels in particular.

45:52.212 --> 46:03.504
And he had explained to me that, as with Enderby, his favorite drink in the world was Fundador, particularly the Domecque Fundador, you know, the Reserva, et cetera.

46:04.625 --> 46:11.652
And as it happened under his influence, I had taken a fondness to Fundador, so on some particular

46:13.117 --> 46:35.298
autumn, late morning of a pleasant day, I was walking down Broadway, not far from Columbia, in New York, and I guess Mr. Burgess had an apartment nearby, because he sort of stumbled out into the sun from his apartment building, and he was dressed in sort of open-fold sandals, and his shirt was open to the day when he was blinking in the sun.

46:36.499 --> 46:39.362
And I had, in a brown paper bag, this bottle of Fundador.

46:39.622 --> 46:41.344
He looked at me and said, Bloom, is that you, Bloom?

46:42.205 --> 46:42.685
I said, yes.

46:43.238 --> 46:43.959
Mr. Burgess.

46:45.581 --> 46:48.845
He said, Mr. Bloom, what is it that you have in that bag?

46:49.947 --> 46:57.457
I said, as a matter of fact, Mr. Burgess, it is a full bottle of Pedro Domecque Honda Reserve.

46:58.138 --> 47:01.362
He said, thank God there is a card after all.

47:01.382 --> 47:02.884
He had handed it over immediately.

47:03.585 --> 47:04.967
So I handed it over to him.

47:05.668 --> 47:07.310
He handed me back the brown bag.

47:07.390 --> 47:08.652
It was a big, big bottle.

47:09.133 --> 47:11.676
He unscrewed the top of it, leaned back,

47:12.280 --> 47:16.185
And it took the longest shot I'd ever seen.

47:16.785 --> 47:18.247
Put the bottle down, did it again.

47:18.427 --> 47:19.068
What a story.

47:19.729 --> 47:20.610
Brushed his mouth.

47:20.670 --> 47:21.671
No, the story isn't done.

47:22.713 --> 47:24.254
Screwed the thing and returned it to me.

47:24.435 --> 47:25.556
I instead handed him the bag.

47:25.576 --> 47:26.217
I said, no, no.

47:26.237 --> 47:29.341
I said, Mr. Burgess, I said, you keep it.

47:29.381 --> 47:29.801
It's yours.

47:29.941 --> 47:31.123
I'm going back to the store.

47:32.484 --> 47:35.388
He said, Bloom, he said, I'm forever in your debt.

47:35.528 --> 47:39.553
I owe you a bottle of Domek Reserve upon the door.

47:40.158 --> 47:41.840
I said, you'll pay it back sometime.

47:41.861 --> 47:46.547
He said, either in this life, he switched to my first name, or the next life, Harold.

47:46.568 --> 47:48.591
And as I walked off, he was shouting after me.

47:48.611 --> 47:55.120
He was saying, Harold, he said, when we meet in purgatory, Harold, I will cool the fires.

47:55.321 --> 47:56.803
I will have Domek Reserva.

47:57.344 --> 47:58.125
He is gone now.

47:58.405 --> 47:59.106
I am still here.

47:59.146 --> 48:08.460
It remains to be seen if I reach purgatory, whether Tony, but he very kindly arranged that all of his subsequent books and his posthumous books were all sent to me.

48:08.879 --> 48:20.837
So I figure the debt is paid, even if I don't reach purgatory and find Mr. Burgess waiting for me with a bottle of Domec Fundador.

48:20.857 --> 48:23.280
I enjoyed his book on Marlowe.

48:23.481 --> 48:29.770
He also suggested that Cervantes and Shakespeare... Wonderful story.

48:30.131 --> 48:31.012
Terrific story.

48:31.112 --> 48:32.654
I love that story.

48:32.715 --> 48:37.722
And what Shakespeare is, to his inquisitive, friendly self, Cervantes is a dour.

48:38.140 --> 48:47.211
and not steal out the whole thing, and then accuses Shakespeare of stealing Falstaff from Sancho Panza and Hamlet from Don Quixote.

48:48.272 --> 48:48.532
That's funny.

48:48.553 --> 48:50.255
And Shakespeare in the face, oh, have another drink.

48:50.815 --> 48:55.020
Shakespeare actually uses a character, I'm trying to think of which one it is, from Sancho Panza.

48:55.140 --> 48:55.621
Cardinio.

48:55.861 --> 48:56.082
Cardinio.

48:56.102 --> 48:57.603
But we don't have the text.

48:57.623 --> 48:58.524
The last play, yeah.

48:58.545 --> 49:01.348
There are people who think we have the text, but I'm not persuaded.

49:02.529 --> 49:05.373
But it is interesting that he is certainly familiar with Survivor.

49:05.393 --> 49:05.633
Oh, yes.

49:05.933 --> 49:06.674
Yes, yes, yes.

49:06.694 --> 49:11.560
And you actually suggest that without Shakespeare, Cervantes might be the surrogate Shakespeare.

49:12.502 --> 49:18.009
I think that had Shakespeare not existed, we would rely more upon Cervantes than we do.

49:19.491 --> 49:19.931
And Chaucer.

49:20.893 --> 49:25.799
I mean, Shakespeare's real precursor is not Kit Marlowe, it's Chaucer.

49:26.240 --> 49:33.409
And, you know, the greatest writer in the English language by far is Shakespeare, but close behind is Geoffrey Chaucer.

49:35.313 --> 49:42.062
And, you know, who are great writers of the West, beginning the ancients, you know, from Dante all the way back to Homer.

49:42.723 --> 49:54.679
The great writers of modern times are certainly Shakespeare, Chaucer, Cervantes, well, Chaucer practically contemporary with Dante, generation after Tolstoy.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.101
There are not many.

49:56.221 --> 49:57.623
Proust.

49:57.643 --> 50:00.126
Does this book emerge from the Western canon book?

50:00.426 --> 50:04.712
Only in the sense that it's the book I wanted to write when I was writing the Western canon book.

50:05.148 --> 50:12.017
I was writing about everybody else, but Shakespeare got into every chapter of it because I thought Shakespeare was the Western canon.

50:13.059 --> 50:15.542
I hope this is a better book than the Western canon, I think.

50:16.423 --> 50:24.033
With the Western canon, even though I can't ever keep myself out, I'm idiosyncratic and I tend to be personal and garrulous and eccentric and so on.

50:25.035 --> 50:26.196
But at this point, I didn't care.

50:27.158 --> 50:31.223
I thought, well, the Shakespeare critics I really care for.

50:32.047 --> 50:35.291
Dr. Johnson and has primarily, secondarily, A.C.

50:35.331 --> 50:38.596
Bradley and Harold Goddard and a couple of others.

50:38.616 --> 50:40.619
They put themselves right into it, so that's it.

50:41.980 --> 50:43.462
They're going to hang me anyway, you know.

50:44.884 --> 50:46.246
I like Bradley, actually.

50:46.266 --> 50:47.708
Oh, Bradley's wonderful.

50:47.728 --> 50:49.190
Bradley is hard to overest.

50:49.250 --> 50:51.994
Central tragedy, the Bradleyian tragedy, as you call him.

50:52.014 --> 50:53.696
Not only that, but he's also wonderful.

50:55.318 --> 50:58.563
In the article he wrote called The Rejection of False Stuff, which is terrific.

50:59.884 --> 51:01.767
No, Bradley is a great Shakespeare critic.

51:02.050 --> 51:05.994
You don't agree with it necessarily with the central tragedies, though, that's for sure.

51:06.214 --> 51:06.935
No, no, no.

51:06.955 --> 51:07.595
No, no, I don't.

51:07.876 --> 51:09.197
I don't.

51:09.217 --> 51:12.100
I don't.

51:12.120 --> 51:20.668
I guess my two personal favorites among all of Shakespeare's things, personally, I don't say they're the greatest players, are Macbeth and Measure for Measure.

51:21.208 --> 51:24.031
For some reason, those two haunt me the most.

51:24.552 --> 51:26.814
You don't like The Tempest as much as I feel you should.

51:26.834 --> 51:27.755
I like The Tempest a lot.

51:27.775 --> 51:30.037
It's just that I think that we get it wrong all the time.

51:30.057 --> 51:31.078
I think it is comic.

51:31.902 --> 51:37.248
And it's a fascinating comedy, and it is, I think, an anti-Faustus, which is the original part of my argument.

51:37.289 --> 51:41.293
Prospero just happens to be the Italian translation of the Latin Faustus.

51:41.894 --> 51:44.357
And this is sort of Shakespeare's smiling anti-Faustus.

51:45.138 --> 51:46.780
This is another alternative to Marlowe.

51:47.100 --> 51:48.582
No, I like The Tempest a lot.

51:48.602 --> 51:49.083
I love The Tempest.

51:49.443 --> 51:50.905
Well, it's an enigmatic play.

51:51.746 --> 51:53.608
I prefer The Windest Tale to The Tempest.

51:55.010 --> 52:00.036
And in some ways, I prefer The Shakespearean Parts of the Two Noble Kinsmen to almost anything by Shakespeare.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.728
which is eccentric of me.

52:02.748 --> 52:06.712
You don't necessarily agree with the suggestion that Frostborough is speaking for Shakespeare?

52:07.393 --> 52:07.453
No.

52:07.473 --> 52:08.955
He's saying farewell.

52:08.975 --> 52:09.796
No, no, no.

52:09.876 --> 52:18.925
I think Falstaff is speaking for Shakespeare, and maybe, maybe Shakespeare is taken over by Hamlet, as I say, and makes Shakespeare his mouthpiece.

52:19.646 --> 52:28.015
I think the two characters he has the most intimate and personal relationship to are Hamlet and Falstaff, and the end of the two is Falstaff.

52:29.615 --> 52:30.036
You know what?

52:30.296 --> 52:32.599
It's 2 o'clock, and I think you've got another interview coming up.

52:32.959 --> 52:34.581
No, no, not for a while.

52:34.601 --> 52:35.182
Okay.

52:35.442 --> 52:36.443
I'm going to rest a while.

52:36.463 --> 52:38.025
I think you should get a little bit of rest.

52:38.045 --> 52:47.937
And then this evening, my wife is going to come, and then this evening I've got to change my clothes, look respectable, and show up at Waterstones, read from my book and sign books.

52:48.498 --> 52:52.543
Just briefly, I have to tell you, my wife, she's reading the reader's copy.

52:52.643 --> 52:54.185
She is involved with this book.

52:54.205 --> 52:56.668
She is the kind of reader that you're looking for.

52:56.969 --> 52:59.532
She's an intelligent woman, a college graduate.

52:59.552 --> 53:00.613
She's not a professional.

53:01.214 --> 53:02.055
Thanks her for me.

53:02.356 --> 53:09.684
And I said to her today... I think the book will succeed because I think it will find the readers it was intended for.

53:09.765 --> 53:14.050
And I said to my wife today, I said, Connie, I'm so proud of you for enjoying this book so much.

53:14.090 --> 53:15.011
She said, it's brilliant.

53:15.031 --> 53:15.552
It's beautiful.

53:15.892 --> 53:22.720
She said, please tell Professor Blum how much... Would you tell her that I'm very gratified and I'm very touched.

53:22.780 --> 53:25.744
And I hope that as before, when you write something, dear,

53:26.011 --> 53:30.217
I don't want to see it until it's published, but I hope you'll send me a copy after it's published.

53:30.237 --> 53:31.839
You have my home address?

53:32.159 --> 53:32.399
I do.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.023
No, because I've greatly enjoyed what you've written before.

53:35.043 --> 53:36.064
You don't pull punches.

53:36.705 --> 53:39.008
You don't try to save me from my wicked mouth.

53:39.789 --> 53:41.652
I don't want to be saved from my wicked mouth.

53:41.692 --> 53:44.435
You should have no anxieties.

53:44.556 --> 53:44.936
No, no, no.

53:45.617 --> 53:47.439
I am interested that you're writing a book about reading.

53:47.840 --> 53:48.981
It's called How to Read and Why.

53:49.282 --> 53:51.505
Do you despair about the state of reading today?

53:51.825 --> 53:53.908
I don't despair because I think we have to fight back.

53:55.829 --> 54:04.678
I want to try to persuade the same readers whom I hope I'm reaching in this book, but even more.

54:05.739 --> 54:15.329
Even though I've got to earn my bread in the universities, even more than in this book, I don't want to write for anybody in the universities.

54:15.349 --> 54:24.739
I want to write for anyone who feels that they're being shortchanged by the kind of stuff they're reading and shortchanged by the kind of stuff they're writing.

54:25.765 --> 54:29.891
I really want to tell people how to read and why to read it.

54:29.911 --> 54:32.575
Well, she's a little kind of effrontery in that.

54:33.416 --> 54:35.619
But I'd like to write a really useful book.

54:35.800 --> 54:42.249
My great ambition, Court, is that in one of its incarnations, it might wind up a mass-market paperback.

54:42.670 --> 54:43.371
Wouldn't that be great?

54:43.471 --> 54:43.631
Yes.

54:43.811 --> 54:45.634
I'm an educator in my own weird way.

54:45.734 --> 54:49.299
You know, the Academy doesn't think I'm an educator, but I think I'm an educator.

54:50.140 --> 54:52.684
And one of our previous... No, I think Paul Stapp's an educator.

54:53.558 --> 55:05.553
In one of our previous interviews, I was going through the notes, you had quoted your friend Philip Roth, who had suggested once to you that all the real readers are dying and end up being replaced.

55:05.593 --> 55:06.274
Do you believe that?

55:06.474 --> 55:07.816
No.

55:07.836 --> 55:08.517
No.

55:08.537 --> 55:23.295
Because I look at my current Yale undergraduates, and I look at my current NYU graduate students who are very different kinds of people, I look at these solemn, beautiful, rather tough, wise, young Asian-American women

55:23.950 --> 55:27.996
I don't say they're the only people who are going to save the country.

55:28.116 --> 55:29.418
They're going to help save the country.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.945
They are readers the way I was a reader when I was a little bit.

55:34.145 --> 55:36.729
Maybe they're not as crazy as I am, obsessive as I was.

55:37.310 --> 55:38.511
But they are real readers.

55:38.972 --> 55:42.598
And they don't want people shouting feminist ideology at them.

55:43.098 --> 55:47.905
And they don't want people telling them about new historicists, pukos, social energies.

55:48.426 --> 55:53.113
They don't want to be told that Lacan and Derrida teach one how to read and follow them on and so on.

55:54.342 --> 55:55.804
They want to read Shakespeare.

55:55.884 --> 55:57.026
They want to read Chaucer.

55:57.046 --> 55:58.047
They want to read Maltin.

55:58.067 --> 56:00.270
They want to read Dickinson.

56:03.875 --> 56:12.886
You know, it's sad to me to say this, but I think intellectually, even spiritually, the Jews are finished now in the United States and everywhere else.

56:13.047 --> 56:14.909
I'm in deep sadness about that.

56:15.690 --> 56:23.480
The sense in which, in my generation, a considerable portion of the American intelligence here were Jewish, that's all over.

56:23.500 --> 56:23.961
They have not

56:24.295 --> 56:28.881
integrated, and they are no more or less bookish than the rest of the country.

56:30.503 --> 56:36.851
But the new Jews are these second-generation Asian-American kids.

56:36.871 --> 56:38.233
And I have a great hope in them.

56:38.734 --> 56:42.279
They're the bulk of my students here.

56:42.299 --> 56:43.500
And they're wonderful.

56:43.620 --> 56:44.722
And you said female.

56:44.762 --> 56:48.767
Well, the female's even brighter than the male, or at least they're a little less inhibited.

56:48.807 --> 56:50.409
At least I can get them to talk in class.

56:50.489 --> 56:51.771
I can't get the young men to talk.

56:52.578 --> 56:54.441
And it's enough trouble getting young women to talk.

56:54.461 --> 56:55.662
But then I'm not a good teacher.

56:55.722 --> 57:01.250
If the definition of a good teacher is someone who'd really get his students to talk in class, I've never been a good teacher.

57:01.711 --> 57:02.692
Do they write good papers?

57:02.732 --> 57:04.435
They write good papers.

57:04.455 --> 57:09.542
And when I beg them to say something, you know, I say, you know, have pity on the poor, tired old man.

57:09.562 --> 57:11.044
They'll stop saying interesting things.

57:11.645 --> 57:15.771
The problem is that they're 19 or 20, I'm 68.

57:15.871 --> 57:20.357
In many cases, I taught their parents.

57:23.797 --> 57:32.088
It's very hard for me to get them to talk, because they figure the old months that he could be carried out at any time, I wouldn't hear what he has to say.

57:32.108 --> 57:35.333
That doesn't make for good classes.

57:35.393 --> 57:37.236
Obviously, there are personality holes, too.

57:37.256 --> 57:45.968
You said earlier, at the very beginning of this interview, that you've made it quite clear to the people at NYU and at Yale, one or the other, you're going to be going out feet first.

57:46.128 --> 57:46.408
Oh, yeah.

57:46.648 --> 57:47.189
Why is that?

57:48.231 --> 57:49.673
There's two reasons.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.116
One is polemical.

57:52.552 --> 58:01.065
I love what has happened to the teaching of literature in the universities, and I want to be there to do it the way I think it should be done, right down to my dying moment.

58:01.465 --> 58:05.672
Two, I'm a solitary.

58:07.274 --> 58:08.756
A lot of my old friends are dead.

58:08.776 --> 58:10.178
I find it hard to make new friends.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.062
I can't stand being alone all the time.

58:14.324 --> 58:15.827
I can't just drive my wife crazy.

58:19.011 --> 58:21.495
I think I would get very depressed.

58:22.690 --> 58:25.314
And then I would go mad and die if I didn't teach.

58:25.354 --> 58:27.878
So it's just a question of survival.

58:28.839 --> 58:32.204
And then finally, we talk about Shakespeare totally standing alone.

58:32.825 --> 58:36.270
Are there any parallels in any of the other creative arts that you can think of?

58:36.331 --> 58:39.315
I mean, would you say in music, Beethoven and Mozart and, uh,

58:39.785 --> 58:46.498
You know, Michelangelo, Leonardo, I'm just wondering if there are any geniuses... I think, well, there's no doubt.

58:46.518 --> 58:48.402
Let's see if this is when we can figure this out.

58:48.422 --> 58:48.662
All right.

58:48.823 --> 58:50.266
Since I'm so terrible.

58:50.286 --> 58:51.388
This button here is ringing.

58:51.428 --> 58:52.029
Want me to answer?

58:52.049 --> 58:53.151
Yes, yes.

58:53.171 --> 58:53.312
Answer.

58:53.332 --> 58:53.652
Hello?

58:54.955 --> 58:56.859
One... Yes, one moment, please.

58:57.660 --> 58:58.041
Hello?

58:58.061 --> 59:00.105
Oh, hi.
