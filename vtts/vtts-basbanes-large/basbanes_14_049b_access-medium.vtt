00:02.005 --> 00:05.390
Okay, we're taping again.

00:05.590 --> 00:19.231
This is the guy that's the union representative to SEIU.

00:19.251 --> 00:27.343
He doesn't work for librarians, he does work for the library, but represents several different guilds, one of them being the librarians' guild.

00:27.803 --> 00:30.848
And he stood up at one place and suggested, well, just, you know,

00:31.081 --> 00:34.126
As you've got to cut things, reduce your book budget.

00:34.907 --> 00:36.510
And my position was absolutely not.

00:37.952 --> 00:40.035
Why do people come to a library?

00:40.316 --> 00:44.843
Do they come to a library to see staff, or do they come to a library for books and materials?

00:45.584 --> 00:47.567
What do you change the nature of the institution?

00:47.587 --> 00:53.917
This is the argument we had in 1994, when the proposal of the mayor was basically to eliminate the book budget.

00:54.158 --> 00:58.725
You change the nature of an institution if you're no longer buying materials.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.649
Are you buying materials now?

01:00.789 --> 01:06.235
I mean, I've heard suggestions that new acquisitions of books is almost moribund right now.

01:06.255 --> 01:06.876
Is that...?

01:07.216 --> 01:08.117
I don't think that's true.

01:08.297 --> 01:09.919
No, no, that's something I'll ask.

01:09.959 --> 01:11.181
Let me be really honest, too.

01:11.221 --> 01:16.667
I think that some of the people you're talking to, I think, are some of the most deceitful group of people with their own political agenda.

01:17.168 --> 01:28.881
I think the agenda of about five of the library staff, and you've probably talked to all five, or you will, has been maintaining their own political power, has been

01:29.300 --> 01:33.928
I mean, even Dowlin, going to his teaching job he's got now, was hounded.

01:33.968 --> 01:41.420
David Price, who was our financial guy, was hounded in his job as a state librarian in West Virginia.

01:42.902 --> 01:44.565
Do you want to see how great these folks are?

01:44.865 --> 01:46.648
Would you like to see?

01:46.989 --> 01:52.157
This is up on billboards, you know, around, went up this weekend.

01:52.177 --> 01:53.039
This is on me.

01:54.842 --> 01:55.763
I want to post that.

01:55.878 --> 02:02.487
I'm looking for the take at a wanted post to Stephen A. Coulter, SBC Communications.

02:02.587 --> 02:04.489
What's that, SBC Communications?

02:04.509 --> 02:05.611
It's the Holman Company.

02:05.731 --> 02:06.812
I'm sorry, Bill.

02:06.872 --> 02:08.595
So this is what you are.

02:10.197 --> 02:13.661
You represent the public, not a greedy Texas telephone company.

02:14.322 --> 02:16.465
You're a lawbreaker, a public library.

02:16.485 --> 02:17.326
What do they mean by that?

02:19.208 --> 02:21.031
They're alleging that you're a lawbreaker?

02:22.332 --> 02:23.374
A legal conflict?

02:23.434 --> 02:25.817
Coulter owns over 5,000 SBCs?

02:26.320 --> 02:31.065
If it's true, why is it an issue?

02:31.085 --> 02:34.189
I didn't put it up.

02:34.209 --> 02:38.774
No one has come and talked to me about it.

02:38.794 --> 02:39.535
Yeah, legal meetings.

02:40.255 --> 02:40.856
Open meetings.

02:40.936 --> 02:44.740
Are they alleging open meeting law violations?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.722
How do you respond when you see something like this?

02:47.023 --> 02:47.904
Because I just laughed.

02:48.004 --> 02:48.645
I couldn't believe it.

02:48.665 --> 02:50.126
I've gotten several calls today.

02:50.146 --> 02:51.808
Why is there this kind of hostility?

02:51.828 --> 02:56.293
Is this coming from this group of librarians?

02:56.577 --> 03:05.627
a guy named Gillespie, who's in court suing us on stuff, and some of the people you're going to be talking to tomorrow you've already talked to.

03:05.647 --> 03:19.383
It's the guild activists of which they're—some of the guild stewards, frankly, are fine and great people, but there's two or three that have a really sour attitude on life, and they don't want any changes, no matter what the changes are.

03:19.483 --> 03:26.010
Wax eloquently about the glories of the old main library, you know, when it was a disaster.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.618
And this kind of stuff.

03:27.638 --> 03:39.689
I mean, I get attacked at commission meetings fairly regularly by guild people, and by half a dozen, not even half a dozen, three or four, that the gadflies, two or three of them more than most.

03:39.909 --> 03:41.150
What do you mean gadflies?

03:41.190 --> 03:44.653
These are people from the civilian side of speech.

03:44.673 --> 03:52.220
Yeah, they're just self-appointed community people who come in, and there's about four of them.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.782
Like Kerwin?

03:55.083 --> 04:00.652
is one of those that's involved in a lawsuit that Jim Gillespie you will end up talking to.

04:00.892 --> 04:01.092
Chafee.

04:01.112 --> 04:07.943
Chafee's fame and glory is that he hasn't missed a commission meeting in 20 years.

04:08.103 --> 04:16.416
He alleges that there was money left for acquisitions of books and that it was diverted to

04:17.122 --> 04:19.065
to get computer stuff.

04:19.085 --> 04:22.410
And I guess there wasn't one of the suits that you watched, I think, by the way.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.411
You suit us on that.

04:23.632 --> 04:41.618
The suit that's in court right now, in which that's where this tape issue comes up, is whether under the Sunshine Ordinance we came out of a closed-door session and announced that we had a leading candidate for secretary.

04:42.159 --> 04:46.065
We would not announce it yet pending a background investigation by staff.

04:46.855 --> 04:50.160
and further questions by a couple of us of some of his previous employers.

04:50.861 --> 04:57.492
They sued over that and the appointment of Gina Menudry, but this is the one that's still there.

04:57.512 --> 05:02.820
The judge ruled that Gina Menudry was moot, and it was the mayor's prerogative.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.962
She sounds wonderful.

05:04.022 --> 05:04.563
Oh, she's wonderful.

05:04.603 --> 05:05.845
I can't wait to meet her.

05:05.865 --> 05:06.646
She's a hoot.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.451
Wasn't she considered for the Dowling job?

05:09.511 --> 05:12.315
Wasn't she actually considered for this job once upon a time?

05:12.516 --> 05:13.437
She told me that, yeah.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.477
I wasn't here when Dalvin was.

05:15.557 --> 05:16.519
This was before my watch.

05:16.539 --> 05:17.540
Dalvin was hired in 87.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.164
I came on at the end of the day.

05:20.985 --> 05:23.568
But anyway, so they're in suit.

05:23.608 --> 05:27.854
They try to get a restraining order against us for moving forward.

05:28.054 --> 05:31.039
And it gets really vicious.

05:31.279 --> 05:35.365
The tape of that particular meeting, we can't find.

05:35.845 --> 05:43.035
But the legal issue is minuscule, basically, as to whether or not we had to

05:43.471 --> 05:55.246
Their position is we have to violate the privacy of the individual candidate because we said we had a leading contender, therefore we had to go public with that, and then do the background search with the police search.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.008
We talked to previous employers.

05:57.029 --> 05:58.791
We told staff to do that.

05:58.811 --> 06:04.058
The next meeting of the commission, we heard from the staff on the background.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.279
We interviewed the guy once more.

06:05.339 --> 06:06.541
We offered him a job.

06:06.561 --> 06:07.662
We came out and we announced.

06:08.143 --> 06:12.128
They're claiming that we are criminals because

06:13.171 --> 06:15.675
of how we handled that.

06:15.775 --> 06:19.039
This is Chafee's 15th lawsuit against us.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.542
He won one.

06:21.343 --> 06:28.573
The one that he won was three committee members were meeting.

06:28.613 --> 06:29.995
There were seven members on the commission.

06:30.556 --> 06:38.908
Three people were sitting holding a meeting on finance, and one of the commissioners came, another commissioner came and sat in the audience and wanted to hear the testimony.

06:39.715 --> 06:47.465
They claimed that that was an illegal meeting of the Library Commission because you had a fourth member there, even if she didn't say it.

06:49.128 --> 06:52.112
She just sat, listened, took some notes, got up a month.

06:52.132 --> 06:53.674
They're claiming that that was a violation.

06:53.694 --> 06:58.761
And the judge said, under the Sunshine Ordinance, technically that's true.

06:58.781 --> 07:09.435
So going forward, if, for example, what came up not a month later was I wanted to testify on my own bill that I had up in front of the commissions.

07:10.327 --> 07:21.122
And so we had to post a legal notice that said this is a meeting of the planning committee, you know, composed of these people.

07:21.663 --> 07:30.455
If a fourth commissioner should attend, it will become a full meeting of the library commission and is duly noticed, which is absurd and it's very confusing.

07:31.597 --> 07:35.082
I showed up at the meeting, presented to the committee, left.

07:36.103 --> 07:37.465
They then went into courts.

07:39.233 --> 07:47.983
accused me of blatantly disregarding the judge's orders and accused me of criminal conduct, and the judge threw it out.

07:48.443 --> 07:49.965
Said what they did was perfectly reasonable.

07:49.985 --> 07:53.809
They followed precisely what it was I suggested.

07:53.829 --> 07:56.011
That's the level of combat.

07:56.712 --> 08:04.601
I call it fairies on it, counting fairies on the head of the pin, kind of legalese.

08:04.861 --> 08:08.565
I mean, if you think of in the...

08:08.782 --> 08:09.784
In the Middle Ages.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.687
There's angels on the head of a pin, yeah.

08:11.787 --> 08:14.211
Yeah, angels on the head of a pin are fairies.

08:15.493 --> 08:18.518
It is, it's nonsensical, the stuff we get into.

08:18.538 --> 08:24.387
But you get this stuff, the judge actually lost his temper with them last week at one of their court events.

08:24.427 --> 08:27.352
So what's motivating the gadflies?

08:27.372 --> 08:28.935
The gadflies, oh, it's fame and glory.

08:28.975 --> 08:33.422
I mean, it's trying to, it's a gotcha game.

08:33.841 --> 08:38.206
I mean, you think it's a substitute for there's no more Vietnam War or something like that?

08:38.226 --> 08:44.333
I mean, you think these are people who are inclined to— These are people who are looking— They're in San Francisco.

08:44.533 --> 08:47.737
They're looking for evil, and they will find it.

08:47.817 --> 08:51.301
Chaffey was quite honest in one of his presentations to it.

08:51.321 --> 08:54.525
He doesn't talk often, but he's been doing it for the last few months.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.648
Because for basically two years, he would never say a thing.

08:57.768 --> 09:03.595
But he would write these scathing things and be quoted in The Independent or The Guardian, two or the—

09:04.469 --> 09:07.174
more lefty-oriented publications.

09:09.197 --> 09:18.172
He said that he was the commission, you know, 20 years ago was rude to him, and he was going to get redemption.

09:18.192 --> 09:23.581
He was going to find vindication in his treatment by the commission.

09:23.802 --> 09:25.945
We've all tried to understand him.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.249
When I first came on the commission,

09:29.107 --> 09:35.477
I listen to some of his stuff, puts out a newsletter that tries to look like it's an official publication of the department.

09:36.639 --> 09:39.223
And I sat down with him.

09:39.243 --> 09:40.605
We actually met in my office.

09:40.625 --> 09:41.987
He wanted to come and see my office.

09:42.007 --> 09:42.748
It was in another building.

09:43.229 --> 09:45.412
And we spent probably an hour, two hours together.

09:45.433 --> 09:47.936
I said, what does he want?

09:47.956 --> 09:49.519
And he didn't want anything.

09:49.539 --> 09:50.801
I said, what's your opinion on the library?

09:51.181 --> 09:52.323
I'm talking to him by the way.

09:52.423 --> 09:53.024
I'm just curious.

09:53.064 --> 09:53.846
What does he want?

09:53.906 --> 09:54.386
What does he want?

09:54.547 --> 09:56.650
You tell me.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.420
He wants us to follow the law.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.502
It was really funny.

09:59.943 --> 10:05.312
On the restraining order they wanted against us on the secretary of the commission, they asked for us to follow the law.

10:05.713 --> 10:08.538
The judge looked at it and said, I'll grant that restraining order, follow the law.

10:09.320 --> 10:13.347
And they thought they had a great victory, and then the city attorney says, what does that mean?

10:13.367 --> 10:17.996
Can we hire this, move ahead with the hiring of the city librarian and the secretary?

10:18.016 --> 10:20.781
He said, if you think that's following the law, you go ahead and do whatever you want.

10:21.436 --> 10:22.838
And then they were devastated.

10:23.078 --> 10:24.260
I mean, that's the silliness.

10:24.320 --> 10:29.026
It is at this level of absolute petty bullshit.

10:29.607 --> 10:31.449
And what's that all about?

10:31.489 --> 10:34.554
Well, I guess they want you to step down from the library.

10:34.574 --> 10:36.576
I think you've got to look at it.

10:37.097 --> 10:43.065
When you meet Gina, you'll know right now why they can't attack her.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.570
She has no responsibility for anything that's ever happened.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.372
She's a retired...

10:48.773 --> 10:50.815
librarian from Berkeley for 20 years.

10:50.835 --> 10:56.000
And made it clear that she has no agenda beyond six months, so she's really here for that.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.541
She's a former ALA president.

10:57.661 --> 11:00.764
I've read her credentials.

11:00.824 --> 11:02.565
She's fabulous.

11:03.066 --> 11:15.417
She's a real easy-going, you know, she'll be all rumpled the way she dresses, and she's a tough lady, and she's funny, and she's frankly, she's shocking them.

11:15.437 --> 11:18.780
I mean, she's saying things that Dowling said, and they were all over his case.

11:19.452 --> 11:22.195
Card catalog came up at our last commission meeting.

11:22.435 --> 11:31.225
And she looked at them and said, card catalog is just not an efficient, meaningful way to maintain any kind of your collection.

11:31.245 --> 11:32.025
You can't find it.

11:32.065 --> 11:35.449
You have to have card catalogs in all of the different branches.

11:35.830 --> 11:43.658
It is the most costly way imaginable to maintain your collection and to provide access to it.

11:43.918 --> 11:48.463
And it's just not financially feasible in this institution or in any libraries.

11:49.287 --> 11:52.150
As a backup system, you know, we've got it sitting in the basement.

11:52.731 --> 11:56.835
But, you know, she's sitting there making statements that Dowlin said, and they just rolled all over.

11:57.816 --> 12:15.295
And with her, you know, the two or three people that are regulars in the audience, you know, were just sitting and looking at her with wide eyes, and the little union click, which was all over Dowlin on the, you know, on the card catalog issue, just sat there and looked.

12:15.315 --> 12:16.677
They're afraid to say anything to her.

12:16.857 --> 12:18.619
They don't know what to deal with her.

12:19.308 --> 12:20.610
Who are they going to go after then?

12:21.591 --> 12:23.113
Once, Dowlin was the focus.

12:23.593 --> 12:25.456
When Dowlin left, they turned on me.

12:26.277 --> 12:32.365
And then when we brought, then they sort of backed off after a while, because clearly the mayor was not interested.

12:32.425 --> 12:35.028
They were getting nowhere with him.

12:35.909 --> 12:38.673
Then we brought in Gina, who I think has been great.

12:38.793 --> 12:39.614
Now, who picked Gina?

12:40.074 --> 12:40.875
How did you get Gina?

12:41.977 --> 12:42.458
I asked her.

12:42.798 --> 12:44.280
Who was impressed?

12:44.901 --> 12:45.882
I was really impressed.

12:46.042 --> 12:46.783
We were...

12:47.050 --> 12:49.274
I've been trying to work through the backlog.

12:49.294 --> 12:53.240
This was your move, then, to go after Gina?

12:53.260 --> 12:53.941
Yes.

12:54.001 --> 13:04.518
And the commission, in fact, had one of the commissioners here, Charles Aguedis, and I sat for two hours and interviewed Gina before we offered the job, just walking through the issues.

13:04.578 --> 13:06.561
And what's your hope that she will accomplish?

13:07.199 --> 13:09.703
stability and normalcy?

13:10.143 --> 13:20.298
I'm convinced that we will not find a first-rate librarian on a permanent basis to take the system until we show that we are not in the hellhole of libraries on earth.

13:21.080 --> 13:29.893
We get our, you know, address the weeding issue and management, collection management issues.

13:30.293 --> 13:32.797
We address storage issues.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.860
We address

13:35.228 --> 13:37.590
issues around getting materials back on the shelf.

13:37.790 --> 13:41.013
Materials back on the shelf is the number one issue, as far as I'm concerned.

13:41.033 --> 14:00.751
We've gone from the absolute worst, when we had labor fights over the pages, and where we were like six weeks behind in shelving some materials to 72 hours.

14:01.232 --> 14:02.293
That's what we said right now.

14:02.313 --> 14:04.915
It's about 72 hours for all materials.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.627
and they hope to get it to 48.

14:07.768 --> 14:11.051
I just want them to be consistent, set our goal, and then keep it.

14:11.412 --> 14:19.339
I think we've got to do a variety of things to get the library in shape, build what clearly is some continuity here.

14:20.860 --> 14:32.210
We have a reputation of a library that is run, I think, within librarians that I deal with around the country, a library where the union is out of control.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.053
And I think we have to show that that is not the case.

14:35.607 --> 14:38.010
Do you think you have that situation?

14:38.831 --> 14:41.294
I think—I've been involved for nine years.

14:41.314 --> 14:52.586
The union has not always—the union has always been contentious, but I've always found them reasonable to deal with up until the last two years, and the shift in the stewards.

14:52.606 --> 14:56.491
And Kathy Bremer is the chief steward.

14:58.353 --> 15:02.197
And I have found that they were— What's your agenda?

15:02.237 --> 15:03.259
You said political power.

15:03.279 --> 15:04.040
What kind of power?

15:04.060 --> 15:05.361
I mean, I can't even—

15:07.062 --> 15:08.144
chief steward of the librarian.

15:09.846 --> 15:11.348
That's the issue.

15:11.368 --> 15:17.157
You think this is a power grab on her part to actually— You wanted me to be candid.

15:17.637 --> 15:18.739
I'd tell this to her face.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.403
No, I want you to be candid.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.705
I think that's what it's all about.

15:25.328 --> 15:34.502
And you don't think it's about reading collections, folding humanities and literature into one, getting rid of— Who's going to run a library?

15:35.243 --> 15:36.765
They're scared to death of private money.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.212
Because they think private money you can't control.

15:39.932 --> 15:41.233
They don't like volunteers.

15:41.974 --> 15:42.975
Private money being what?

15:43.015 --> 15:45.077
Like a telephone company, for instance?

15:45.097 --> 15:47.399
I mean, that's an issue.

15:47.459 --> 15:56.987
I mean, there is certainly the coincidental circumstance of you're working for this company, which is a major contributor to the library.

15:57.007 --> 15:58.649
Why do you think they're a major contributor to the library?

15:59.970 --> 16:00.530
You tell me.

16:00.730 --> 16:01.111
I don't know.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.052
Because I'm involved.

16:04.694 --> 16:07.056
And I've pushed resources away the library.

16:07.795 --> 16:11.241
So you came before the telephone company, so to speak.

16:12.082 --> 16:15.368
We didn't do squat for the library before I got involved.

16:15.388 --> 16:24.724
I mean, it's also alleged that, you know, the telephone company stands to make thousands of dollars, millions of dollars every time somebody makes a

16:25.042 --> 16:26.864
That it's in your best interest.

16:26.964 --> 16:28.646
I'm telling you what people say.

16:29.707 --> 16:30.748
You've heard this stuff before.

16:30.768 --> 16:31.769
I've heard this stuff before.

16:31.789 --> 16:32.650
I actually went back.

16:32.750 --> 16:37.555
I'm from Massachusetts, so I'm open to hear anything anyone has to say.

16:38.135 --> 16:40.117
Let's just deal with some of these kinds of issues you've got here.

16:41.118 --> 16:41.739
If you don't mind.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.881
I would acknowledge you by asking.

16:43.941 --> 16:49.227
I've had four Ethics Commission violations filed against me in the last year, one by Mr. Hale.

16:49.787 --> 16:50.748
Mr. Hale being who?

16:51.048 --> 16:51.329
I don't know.

16:51.349 --> 16:53.631
Hale is one of the gap lines.

16:54.117 --> 16:57.280
I haven't really talked to all of them, by the way.

16:57.961 --> 17:00.244
One by one of the library staff activists.

17:00.264 --> 17:03.948
It does get tedious after a point, I have to tell you.

17:03.968 --> 17:04.088
Yeah.

17:04.108 --> 17:12.296
So I've had four filed against things, one by one of the gadflies, one signed by one of the union activists, who you probably talked to.

17:12.697 --> 17:13.858
Two others were anonymous.

17:15.059 --> 17:23.989
The Ethics Commission looked at all four of them, and they were all charging that I was doing these illegal things and doing things that I shouldn't be doing within the library.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.353
everything you've heard was in this file.

17:26.994 --> 17:28.755
They found no basis to any of it.

17:28.855 --> 17:31.218
The Ethics Commission of San Francisco.

17:31.238 --> 17:39.886
It's a governmental... It's a governmental body appointed by the mayor that is to look at conflicts of interest between appointed elected officials.

17:39.906 --> 17:40.507
Alleged conflicts of interest.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.710
Alleged conflicts of interest in the city and county of San Francisco.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.053
So I've had four of them filed against me since I've been back on the commission.

17:47.554 --> 17:52.619
Four of them, four times, the commission has found there is no evidence.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.060
When the mayor hired an auditor,

17:54.428 --> 17:56.490
to come in and look at the library.

17:56.550 --> 18:02.996
I said, among the things I'd like you to look at are charges of conflict of interest against me.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.637
She said, I'll add it to the list.

18:05.198 --> 18:18.189
In the audit findings, she came out and said, there have been charges that commission president Steve Coulter has been in a conflict of interest in his position as president of the commission and as also an executive with Pacific Belt.

18:18.670 --> 18:22.613
I find absolutely no basis for any of these charges.

18:22.964 --> 18:34.860
telecommunications department, an agency quite independent, has nothing to do with the library, makes all decisions on telecommunications in this city.

18:35.101 --> 18:36.503
So that's five times.

18:36.743 --> 18:39.827
Five times government agencies have looked at this, and it's still here.

18:40.568 --> 18:45.495
So tell me why I'm still dealing with that if there's not a political agenda that goes beyond this.

18:46.235 --> 18:52.561
Tell me why, if there's not a political agenda, are they hounding Ken Dallin, you know, in his job at San Jose State?

18:52.881 --> 18:58.947
Are they hounding David Price, who was his guy, on the budget when he's back in West Virginia?

18:58.967 --> 19:00.469
Price is a new name for me.

19:00.589 --> 19:01.230
David Price.

19:01.270 --> 19:05.033
He was one of Ken's guys that he hired when I was off the commission.

19:05.974 --> 19:09.518
Do you think Ken Dallin is a man of vision?

19:09.538 --> 19:11.440
I think Ken was really problematic.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.082
I like Ken personally.

19:14.142 --> 19:15.043
I did not hire him.

19:15.631 --> 19:20.116
I thought that he had a broad vision.

19:21.117 --> 19:27.204
I thought it was an impractical one, often, frankly, as we looked at the technology that he wanted to do.

19:27.224 --> 19:28.565
Of the Library of the Future.

19:28.825 --> 19:31.849
I thought the videotape, the one you saw, I gave him the money.

19:31.889 --> 19:36.233
He said he wanted to do a videotape on the Library of the Future.

19:37.234 --> 19:39.277
I said, okay.

19:39.577 --> 19:40.398
I said, here's the money.

19:40.798 --> 19:41.419
Go do it.

19:41.787 --> 19:43.209
You have the robotic voice.

19:43.730 --> 19:48.235
And I saw the goddamn thing, and I looked at it, and I thought, this is terrible.

19:48.696 --> 19:50.578
I asked Ken, what in the hell were you thinking?

19:50.699 --> 19:52.561
I thought it was done here.

19:52.581 --> 19:53.722
Our corporate TV did it.

19:54.183 --> 19:59.870
I asked the woman who had it, I said, do a good job, present his vision.

20:00.351 --> 20:02.614
Because at that point, I'd just come on the commission.

20:03.155 --> 20:06.779
He wanted to put it together, and I thought, well, $25,000, $30,000.

20:07.280 --> 20:11.085
He wanted to do a vision, a videotape that he could show...

20:11.521 --> 20:17.388
basically other techie types, I had thought that it was something we could use in our fundraising.

20:18.069 --> 20:22.434
I saw the tape, and the first thing I said was, you know, Ken, we can't use this.

20:22.454 --> 20:28.962
This is the most cold, insensitive, undesirable picture of the future that I've ever seen.

20:29.002 --> 20:30.904
Well, the woman is a hologram.

20:31.745 --> 20:34.508
I mean, a woman talking who's not real.

20:34.893 --> 20:38.256
So I mean, women would get totally pissed off about that.

20:38.276 --> 20:38.896
I couldn't believe it.

20:38.916 --> 20:41.859
And then the voice, the narrator, is a robotic voice.

20:42.099 --> 20:43.761
Yeah, no, it was a terrible piece.

20:43.821 --> 20:49.926
I said, kid, you can't, your videotape on libraries ought to be just full of kids and exciting programs and history.

20:49.946 --> 20:54.110
I said, you've got kids in there as a little sidelight, about five seconds.

20:54.130 --> 20:54.770
So we never used it.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.692
And the books are in the glass, by the way.

20:56.712 --> 20:57.192
Yeah.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.715
And the type catalog is gathering dust.

20:59.815 --> 21:01.136
It's a relic of fossil.

21:01.156 --> 21:03.718
I said, Jesus Christ, if you're looking to influence people.

21:03.918 --> 21:05.680
Well, but you've got to look at what Ken was.

21:06.441 --> 21:14.551
He saw himself—because I went to a number of ALA and CLA conferences where Ken spoke, because I wanted to see the guy.

21:14.571 --> 21:23.382
And I took part in some conferences myself, just talking about what our emerging vision was for the San Francisco Library and fundraising kind of stuff.

21:24.904 --> 21:31.512
Ken was—saw himself as a prophet way out there, and the difference between

21:31.812 --> 21:37.577
being a prophet who does not have to produce and being a prophet who does, I think is a lot.

21:38.178 --> 21:43.763
And so when he went from the theoretical to the actually having to do it, I think he ran into a lot of problems.

21:43.783 --> 21:52.591
But as a writer, and as someone who wanted to establish a reputation, he was trying to be further out than anybody else on a lot of the stuff.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.593
And that can get you into trouble sometimes.

21:55.734 --> 22:00.098
If you get into a position where you've actually got to produce and

22:00.770 --> 22:02.212
He was not good political.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.898
I think, I thought a lot of his ideas were very intriguing.

22:06.719 --> 22:09.002
I thought he was a nice guy to deal with personally.

22:11.146 --> 22:22.523
The last year and a half that we, the last year and a half, you know, I've been off commission for two years, although I continued to raise money for the library, went on the Library Foundation.

22:23.104 --> 22:30.034
When I came back, the focus was clearly just, I mean, I came back on in mid-January, and we opened in April.

22:30.470 --> 22:32.773
And so we were just trying to put the opening together.

22:33.274 --> 22:37.220
But after that, there was a disconnect from reality.

22:38.041 --> 22:45.091
We had some strong discussions about the directions we were going.

22:45.131 --> 22:52.582
The book shelving problem, for example, the commission had an entirely different view than Ken did on how we had to handle it.

22:53.303 --> 22:57.709
He wanted to go to war with the Union over the pages.

22:57.875 --> 23:07.406
Because there had been three years of discussions about whether we were going to create a new class of employee called shelvers that would be paid less.

23:08.368 --> 23:10.550
Our pages are the highest paid in the United States.

23:10.650 --> 23:15.957
They make between, I don't know, $12 and $15 now, an hour.

23:17.739 --> 23:22.004
And Ken wanted to set up a new category at $7 an hour, and they were called shelvers.

23:22.464 --> 23:25.088
And we needed a lot of shelvers for the NMA Library.

23:25.108 --> 23:25.468
We knew that.

23:26.039 --> 23:30.844
He was going to—he was allowing the books to back up, arguing that'll make the union look bad.

23:30.864 --> 23:34.488
And we said, Ken, anyone's going to look bad is you in the library.

23:34.529 --> 23:36.791
We got in a big fight over the thing.

23:37.632 --> 23:45.641
But at the same time, in June of last year, the charter to the city changed, and the role of commissions changed.

23:45.661 --> 23:51.287
And we went from a commission that oversaw basically everything to a commission that was only policy.

23:53.430 --> 23:55.472
And that—

23:56.482 --> 24:00.125
Ken felt that meant that the commission didn't run the library.

24:00.225 --> 24:00.626
He did.

24:00.666 --> 24:01.666
He was the CEO.

24:01.706 --> 24:02.667
He was the mayor's guy.

24:03.408 --> 24:11.194
We told him, yeah, that's true in some sense, but you're not the mayor's guy.

24:11.635 --> 24:18.541
You're Steinstein's guy, and she hasn't been the mayor for a long time, and you're not appointee of this mayor.

24:18.561 --> 24:26.067
Anyway, he pushed back on us and basically alienated his own commission on him, and then he ran into financial trouble.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.981
So he had to go.

24:29.442 --> 24:34.146
Basically, he had not thought through some of the budget items well at all.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.009
The page issue turned out to be a disaster.

24:37.729 --> 24:39.951
People found it hard to find a lot of materials.

24:40.252 --> 24:41.693
Now, let me come out on his defense.

24:43.394 --> 24:55.885
One labor person that you have talked to came and approached the senior managers and said, you know, books will get back on the shelf a whole lot quicker if you get rid of those volunteers.

24:56.388 --> 25:07.223
You have to assume that there was some sabotage on people wanting him to look as bad as possible to get rid of the guy.

25:07.243 --> 25:10.207
Can— Of course, you have nothing to back that up.

25:10.247 --> 25:15.274
That's just the sense that you have, based on maybe— Comments like that.

25:15.294 --> 25:21.923
—the veiled—the not-so-veiled suggestion that maybe, you know, if you get rid of the volunteers,

25:22.747 --> 25:25.331
As Ken was arguing... Things will improve.

25:25.571 --> 25:26.913
Let me give you some examples.

25:26.993 --> 25:33.343
Ken, when we was talking about the pages at their worst, Kathy Bremer put out a flyer.

25:34.725 --> 25:35.586
She's the chief steward.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.649
I know, by the way.

25:37.809 --> 25:39.792
Yeah, calling for the pages.

25:39.812 --> 25:40.994
It was a call to arms.

25:41.695 --> 25:45.240
Don't let them, you know, kick out our weakest members.

25:46.102 --> 25:47.764
We had 23 pages show up.

25:47.784 --> 25:49.787
I'd listened to all of them in three minutes apiece.

25:51.069 --> 25:51.690
Angry...

25:52.328 --> 25:58.056
at anyone who would threaten them, and a lot of them, in their public testimony.

25:58.597 --> 26:11.013
Because the union over time has taken the pages and allowed a page to go from somebody who just shelves books to someone who can check them out, who can have access to the database, what have you, which is a little bit more like a librarian than a page.

26:11.714 --> 26:17.763
And we have page after page stand up there and talk about, if they have to, they will put books on the shelf.

26:18.183 --> 26:21.087
But primarily they're writers and authors and

26:21.421 --> 26:22.642
They are playwrights.

26:23.403 --> 26:25.285
They are working on their second degrees.

26:26.806 --> 26:37.497
And the commission came away with a point of view that basically this is an angry group of employees, one that thinks they're too good to show books, and probably one.

26:37.778 --> 26:39.179
We talked to some of my other commissioners.

26:39.219 --> 26:40.020
Don't just look at me.

26:40.040 --> 26:45.325
I mean, I'm one of seven.

26:46.506 --> 26:48.549
But I think pages do important work.

26:48.569 --> 26:50.010
You've got to have somebody doing it.

26:50.463 --> 26:55.208
I think we've created a professional class of pages that no other library has done.

26:55.248 --> 26:59.351
New York pays six an hour, and we're paying 15 for our top pages.

27:00.473 --> 27:05.637
And it's, you know, we hired 40 more pages.

27:06.779 --> 27:15.827
The union's position is pages should be full-time, full benefits, protected position.

27:15.847 --> 27:18.850
I think that's the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life.

27:19.522 --> 27:26.269
But if the city is willing to come up with the money for a skewed labor force, then great.

27:26.289 --> 27:26.710
I don't care.

27:27.450 --> 27:32.055
I mean, that's a decision the mayor and the board of supervisors are going to make.

27:32.396 --> 27:34.318
They're imposing these conditions on us.

27:34.718 --> 27:39.804
I just have to sit and look at the budget and wonder, are we so politicized?

27:39.964 --> 27:45.850
Is the union trying to roil up problems so much that it makes so many people angry that you had problems?

27:46.218 --> 27:51.463
I mean, I have had stories of people come and say pages are putting the books in the wrong place intentionally.

27:52.024 --> 27:56.788
They wanted to maximize the pain on Dallin to get rid of him.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.310
So that's in his defense.

27:58.951 --> 28:05.177
I've already told you on the other side, I thought he was his own worst enemy on a lot of stuff and wouldn't listen to the commission.

28:05.777 --> 28:09.381
And we had some real come-to-Jesus private discussions with him.

28:09.401 --> 28:15.567
We're criticized because we didn't do it publicly up until almost the very end.

28:16.255 --> 28:25.925
We had ordered him, the last commission meeting before he left, I had sat in a meeting, and I had absolutely ordered him to meet with the union on these issues.

28:26.185 --> 28:29.188
The rest of the commission concurred that he must do that.

28:30.029 --> 28:37.036
And he gave his presentation on the budget, which was probably the best presentation he's ever done on the budget, the most cohesive I'd ever seen.

28:38.257 --> 28:42.762
And we asked about his union conferring, and he said he hadn't met.

28:42.782 --> 28:46.245
All seven of us at that point were so angry.

28:47.103 --> 28:47.964
We knew it was useless.

28:48.585 --> 28:55.975
We knew that sitting down with Kathy Bremer would accomplish nothing, but he had an obligation to sit down and do it.

28:57.036 --> 28:57.697
And he wouldn't do it.

28:58.278 --> 29:01.482
He refused to deal with them most of his last year.

29:02.844 --> 29:04.586
And it was stupid.

29:05.087 --> 29:10.254
From our position, it was absolutely a kiss of death, because I don't think the rank and file is hostile.

29:11.095 --> 29:12.958
I think most people on the staff are great people.

29:13.999 --> 29:14.680
I think you've got

29:14.879 --> 29:15.760
some troublemakers.

29:15.860 --> 29:20.444
I think this is San Francisco, you know, where everybody, you know, loves a good fight.

29:21.225 --> 29:27.931
I think most of the staff, everything I've heard, is they just want to get on with the job, and they're tired of, you know, this kind of stuff in some of these meetings.

29:28.432 --> 29:33.897
Some of the people are absolutely shocked to find out some of the things, you know, that happen in some of our meetings.

29:34.577 --> 29:40.903
I mean, when you're sitting down there with Kathy Bremer and some of her folks, ask them why they were so opposed to private money.

29:41.003 --> 29:42.945
Why are they so opposed to my

29:43.786 --> 29:45.808
You know, my affinity group center is coming in.

29:45.828 --> 29:55.799
Well, yeah, and, you know, I said to some of these people, I said, you know, I did Paul LeClaire, who's the president of the New York Public Library, who was a friend of mine.

29:56.399 --> 29:57.721
Heard great things about him.

29:58.201 --> 30:00.284
And, you know, he's not a librarian, he's a librarian.

30:00.384 --> 30:04.068
Well, most of the great librarians today aren't librarians.

30:04.088 --> 30:09.173
I mean, Barton is a historian.

30:09.233 --> 30:13.017
Barton is one of the people who got us energized.

30:13.452 --> 30:16.975
Yeah, it's fabulous.

30:17.256 --> 30:22.200
And so Paul said to me, you know how much money I have to raise every week?

30:23.341 --> 30:27.205
He said, pick a number to keep this thing going.

30:28.186 --> 30:29.547
I said, $200,000.

30:29.667 --> 30:32.730
He said, $600,000 a week is what I raise.

30:34.272 --> 30:35.893
You know, that's $30 million a year.

30:36.514 --> 30:43.240
And the New York Public Library, as I said to some of these people, had to realize that's a totally

30:43.709 --> 31:12.130
that's public only in name it's a private totally private institution and arguably the greatest public library in the world it's fabulous it is fabulous so I mean that's not a defense that you know I told you I have an open mind to these things and I'm a book person and I'm a library person but you know is it necessary to keep every copy of the phone book I hope not

31:12.329 --> 31:13.971
You know what I'm saying?

31:14.092 --> 31:22.103
But I think one copy of the phone book is good because you do get demographic information out of the phone book.

31:22.143 --> 31:25.227
You know, we're struggling.

31:25.247 --> 31:29.734
I'm concerned now, but when we had our first chat on the phone, you didn't say we had our problems.

31:31.196 --> 31:31.596
Oh, we do.

31:31.616 --> 31:33.820
Major problems, and you're hoping that they're behind you.

31:34.801 --> 31:37.545
I am concerned about the future.

31:37.805 --> 31:39.748
I mean, is there room for new books down there?

31:39.768 --> 31:40.429
So clearly...

31:40.662 --> 31:59.563
There's going to have to be kind of an aggressive program of weeding and getting— Well, I want to— And we haven't really discussed the sending of the books off to the landfill, which really probably, you know, is easily their most dramatic, you know, of the Nicholson-Bakers story which made this national.

31:59.644 --> 32:07.092
Yeah, that happened about the time I was coming on The Commissioner, maybe it wasn't even on yet, it happened in December.

32:07.713 --> 32:08.975
I came on in mid-January.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.618
I was right in there when that story hit.

32:11.858 --> 32:12.298
Which story?

32:12.399 --> 32:13.099
The dumping of the books.

32:13.119 --> 32:14.501
The dumping of the books.

32:14.521 --> 32:18.926
And it made no sense to me, because they're not supposed to do that.

32:19.868 --> 32:22.691
I mean, that's not what our policy is, that you take books to the dump.

32:23.131 --> 32:28.318
Now, that was the policy under the city when I first came in, when Dowland first came in.

32:28.378 --> 32:37.028
And Dowland, to his credit, went to the board of supervisors and said, I ought to be able to sell books that we don't need anymore, that we need it, or give them away.

32:37.447 --> 32:39.730
They changed the statutes within the city.

32:39.790 --> 32:42.034
At that point, that's all you could do.

32:42.635 --> 32:47.582
You had to declare surplus and of no use, and you tossed it.

32:47.602 --> 32:49.825
So he changed the law in San Francisco.

32:50.366 --> 32:55.994
That stuff, we've got a process that says, you know, the friends can sell it.

32:56.354 --> 32:57.756
You give it to community groups.

32:57.837 --> 33:04.426
We've gone one step further, and, you know, we can give them away to the public now when we have no use for them anywhere else.

33:05.007 --> 33:07.150
But that was a weird one.

33:07.940 --> 33:10.483
And I handled that one wrong coming on the commission.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.784
I made a big mistake on that.

33:12.245 --> 33:16.269
I thought our focus was opening the new main library.

33:16.309 --> 33:17.530
I thought it was an aberration.

33:18.451 --> 33:24.218
I don't know how many were taken to the dump, but it was clearly not policy to do that.

33:24.238 --> 33:24.918
But it happened.

33:25.399 --> 33:33.988
I should have called a public meeting on it and chastised the hell out of some staff and come to the bottom of what happened.

33:34.008 --> 33:35.550
I thought you didn't know about it.

33:36.492 --> 33:37.573
I do about it after the fact.

33:37.653 --> 33:40.957
I mean, it shows up in the paper, and I'm reading the thing and saying, what in the hell is this?

33:40.977 --> 33:43.479
No, but you didn't know about it while it was going on.

33:43.559 --> 33:45.021
No, I didn't know a thing about it.

33:45.041 --> 33:46.402
I talked to the senior library staff.

33:46.422 --> 33:48.965
They tell me they didn't know anything about it either.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.747
So what was Dowling's undoubtedly must have known?

33:53.209 --> 33:54.570
He claims he didn't.

33:54.590 --> 33:56.052
Kathy Page claims she didn't know.

33:56.072 --> 33:57.073
So who was doing it?

33:58.694 --> 34:01.637
Well, I mean, you get into one of these kinds of things.

34:02.158 --> 34:06.162
The argument was that staff was acting in an unauthorized way that got in a panic.

34:06.732 --> 34:08.154
over how to move this stuff.

34:08.174 --> 34:14.363
He closed the old main library in December, and they had to move, pick a number, umpteen million items.

34:14.423 --> 34:18.209
Dowling picked 13 million items, and I've heard a number of items.

34:18.429 --> 34:20.733
If you count everything, there's a lot of stuff.

34:20.753 --> 34:25.920
And I do think a panic set in, and suddenly the story shows up.

34:26.181 --> 34:30.787
First, any of us and the new commissioners saw it was in the paper that there was this dumping.

34:30.807 --> 34:33.972
I called Dowling and said, what is going on?

34:34.525 --> 34:37.028
And he comes back and says, I'm investigating.

34:37.569 --> 34:42.855
You know, and so— I mean, truly, I'm not a—listen, this is a chapter in a book.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.880
This is not going to be the history of the San Francisco— No, I mean, I know that.

34:46.900 --> 34:53.989
And, you know, there's only—I don't want all of these, but somebody must have audited the trucks.

34:54.069 --> 34:56.652
It must be—it must be a—somebody must know

34:56.868 --> 35:01.755
And I think I made a mistake by not going after them.

35:02.737 --> 35:06.903
It is a knowable thing, I think, you know.

35:07.003 --> 35:07.905
It is a knowable thing.

35:07.925 --> 35:09.948
I think we could have done something.

35:10.028 --> 35:16.377
As president of the commission, I should have stepped in and said, I want to hold public hearings on this or something like that.

35:16.398 --> 35:23.348
What I did not want to do, though, because I was still trying to raise money for the library so that we could have what we needed for the opening in three months,

35:23.497 --> 35:27.622
Would you describe that as a public relations disaster?

35:27.642 --> 35:30.126
When it first hit, it was very upsetting.

35:30.506 --> 35:34.291
I thought it would pass, and it did for a period of time.

35:34.431 --> 35:44.104
And then the Nicholson-Baker stuff came out, who was invited in by Melissa Riley, one of the union stewards of them, Melissa.

35:44.504 --> 35:48.369
Melissa is one of those that vigorously opposes private money in the institution.

35:48.389 --> 35:51.293
And she invited Nicholson-Baker

35:51.577 --> 35:58.185
to talk about stuff, and that's when you got into the fight over not only the dumping of books, but the weeding of books.

35:58.585 --> 36:12.882
And I thought it ended up basically hurting the system, but also an attack on the librarian professionals and their responsibility for managing collections and making decisions.

36:12.902 --> 36:17.047
I mean, as a commissioner, I don't want to make a decision as to what books you keep or not keep.

36:17.087 --> 36:19.069
I don't have any background on that.

36:19.370 --> 36:23.774
I want professionals to make those decisions following reasonable guidelines.

36:23.794 --> 36:26.797
And our guidelines do not allow us to dump books.

36:27.878 --> 36:43.892
Books should not be going to the dump unless they are in a condition of total wreck, falling apart, basically so beat up that no one would want to use them.

36:43.912 --> 36:44.773
And there is no home.

36:44.853 --> 36:45.754
Nobody wants them.

36:45.774 --> 36:46.795
You can't give them away.

36:47.213 --> 36:49.495
then I think you have to address what you're going to do on that.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.819
But that's not our policy to throw books away.

36:52.839 --> 36:55.001
I think that bothers me.

36:55.582 --> 36:58.084
It bothers, obviously, the citizens of the city.

36:58.164 --> 36:59.846
And I should have been more aggressive on it.

36:59.866 --> 37:08.955
My focus was, frankly, opening the library and trying to raise the last millions that we needed and the money that we needed to do a grand opening and kick the whole thing off.

37:09.356 --> 37:10.817
I assumed it would go by.

37:11.698 --> 37:16.343
When the Nicholson-Baker thing hit, it was several months down the road.

37:17.099 --> 37:19.101
you know, just different.

37:19.181 --> 37:20.623
He didn't go back.

37:20.763 --> 37:22.025
Well, what's your reaction to that?

37:22.085 --> 37:24.187
Was that a counterproductive thing?

37:24.328 --> 37:29.394
I thought Nicholson Baker, I mean, we were very nice to him when he first came in.

37:30.235 --> 37:33.098
I wish we'd have just dumped the whole card catalog.

37:33.639 --> 37:41.448
I think we tried to be thoughtful and listen to him and tried to— You're talking about the first story now.

37:41.488 --> 37:45.773
Well, I thought, when he got into the— His article was on the card catalog, and

37:46.360 --> 37:49.846
I thought about the New Yorker article.

37:49.866 --> 37:51.108
There were two New Yorker articles.

37:51.128 --> 38:01.887
There was one on the card catalog, and then there was one about a year ago on the Dumping of Brooks story.

38:02.007 --> 38:10.782
I thought he was a guy that was an activist in his own right, that was brought in by the Guild, which was fine.

38:11.048 --> 38:14.532
tried to whip up a story and then sold it to The New Yorker.

38:14.552 --> 38:17.415
So I thought he had a vested interest in what he was trying to do.

38:17.435 --> 38:18.797
That's my honest take on the guy.

38:19.397 --> 38:23.202
I thought he was over the top in a lot of the charges that he made.

38:23.982 --> 38:40.701
And I finally bought the argument that the card catalog, which we had not updated, had been nothing on since 1991, was an historical artifact worthy of saving for at least a period of time.

38:42.082 --> 38:47.329
And so we're stuck at what's sitting in Brooks Hall right now.

38:47.349 --> 38:48.811
And that's where it'll sit for a while.

38:48.851 --> 38:50.874
There's very little interest in people using it.

38:51.615 --> 39:02.750
Our view was, in listening to staff, and I think a right one, that if people are sent to the card catalog in most cases, it will only create confusion.

39:03.612 --> 39:09.760
And they will then come back and have to find a librarian who will help walk them through why they can't find stuff.

39:11.596 --> 39:22.707
After the earthquake in 1989, they did the first inventory of the collection in memory of anyone who worked for the institution.

39:22.727 --> 39:26.010
And we did not update the card catalog.

39:26.030 --> 39:30.695
I think, if it's okay, I'll get back to you.

39:30.715 --> 39:31.816
I mean, this is a long tape.

39:32.256 --> 39:34.939
I mean, I'm just trying to answer your question.

39:35.219 --> 39:39.443
Obviously, I have feelings on the library.

39:39.743 --> 39:42.547
myself, you know, you've been very generous with your time so far.

39:42.627 --> 39:45.010
I'd be happy to, you want to talk a little more?

39:45.190 --> 39:45.711
Oh, I don't care.

39:45.871 --> 39:48.715
Whatever you want to do, I'm just trying to be, to be helpful.

39:48.815 --> 39:49.476
Okay, no, you are.

39:49.596 --> 40:00.952
I mean, I think, I don't want to see the library continue to get beat up, because I think people, we've probably got too much good publicity that I think the pendulum has gone the other way.

40:00.972 --> 40:04.857
And I'd like to see the pendulum start coming back towards something more

40:05.056 --> 40:07.199
You think now it's bad?

40:07.320 --> 40:10.865
I think it got really bad for a period of time.

40:11.506 --> 40:19.979
I think the pendulum is starting to move into a more reasonable area of looking at us just passionately.

40:20.079 --> 40:26.369
I think bringing Gina in was a stroke of death.

40:26.469 --> 40:28.873
I mean Kathy Page and I talked about it.

40:28.893 --> 40:30.335
Because she's beyond reproach.

40:30.356 --> 40:33.240
Reproach, absolutely.

40:33.794 --> 41:03.193
totally respected by the whole she's wonderful she gave a little speech at her first not a speech she had a prepared statement that she gave at her first commission meeting a month or so ago and it talked about love of books and all that kind of stuff I thought it was great so I had a verbatim made out of it we attach it to the minute I want people to see that because I think she's smart and I think she's having a good time I keep telling her have a good time you're not going to live with this the rest of your life you're only 60 years old

41:03.578 --> 41:04.720
She's got a great background.

41:05.140 --> 41:10.829
This library is one she worked in when she was going to library school.

41:10.849 --> 41:11.109
Here.

41:11.309 --> 41:12.331
Here.

41:12.351 --> 41:14.875
Well, I guess she's going to Berkeley.

41:14.895 --> 41:16.457
Under here being the Bay Area.

41:17.679 --> 41:17.979
Yeah.

41:18.159 --> 41:23.587
And what's funny is when you talk to her, she says, we had a lot of the same staff problems here then that you've gotten out.

41:24.088 --> 41:32.320
The name that some people use for some of the librarians you're talking to, what was it, one woman told me the other day, after the meeting when Annette McNair attacked me,

41:32.738 --> 41:37.443
She said, we call them the coven.

41:37.463 --> 41:38.104
Who's the coven?

41:38.164 --> 41:49.677
The coven is Kenneth McNair, Kathy Bremer, Melissa Riley, Andre Grimes, who am I missing?

41:49.697 --> 41:50.738
I'm missing one or two.

41:52.020 --> 41:57.867
All middle-aged white women who've been in the institution for long and long.

41:57.887 --> 41:59.649
That's kind of a tough statement to make.

41:59.689 --> 42:00.490
I mean, I've heard it.

42:00.510 --> 42:02.712
You know, obviously, I've heard that.

42:03.400 --> 42:07.505
I think we have— That's a very combative kind of a statement.

42:07.525 --> 42:07.945
It is.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.647
It is a combative statement.

42:09.667 --> 42:13.512
Coming out of our hearings— I'm a middle-aged white guy, you know.

42:13.532 --> 42:16.215
But you're not trying to keep people of color out.

42:16.976 --> 42:18.678
You think they're trying to keep people of color out?

42:19.419 --> 42:21.841
I had—came out of one of our public hearings last year.

42:21.901 --> 42:22.602
Out of what now?

42:22.742 --> 42:29.290
Out of the library, out of the process that advises the library and gives input on how we're going to

42:29.624 --> 42:34.709
look at our collections, how we're going to manage our collections, how we're going to look at our programs.

42:34.729 --> 42:52.308
We had a set of extraordinary hearings last year over what was called the MOU, the Memorandum of Understanding, that we had passed between the library and basically the city on how we were going to bring in private money to come into the building of the new Maine.

42:52.368 --> 42:54.771
So there was a process in place, the control that was involved in.

42:55.358 --> 43:01.305
We sought to extend that so that they could continue to raise money for us, only to include all of the branches.

43:02.387 --> 43:12.519
And there was one of the ugliest campaigns I've ever seen in my twenty-five years or so in public life against the private money that came in.

43:12.840 --> 43:17.385
It was led by the people you're talking to from the library and staff.

43:17.405 --> 43:19.047
I kind of said to everybody, by the way.

43:19.248 --> 43:25.095
No, but the basic ones, I mean the ones that I just mentioned, are the core of it.

43:25.362 --> 43:26.023
talk to them.

43:26.163 --> 43:30.147
I'm out front with everything I do.

43:31.388 --> 43:37.494
In some of those meetings, like I had one of them in one meeting said, we've always bought books for black people.

43:37.914 --> 43:41.818
We don't need black people coming in here and telling us what to do.

43:41.838 --> 43:44.040
Now you tell me what that kind of a statement is.

43:44.060 --> 43:49.425
I can tell you what those kinds of statements that were made at our public hearings, how people of color reacted to them.

43:49.866 --> 43:50.687
I called it racism.

43:51.768 --> 43:54.070
One Asian woman, Waku, who was one of our donors,

43:54.387 --> 43:58.794
She walked out of one of our meetings and said, you know, I'm really glad that I came to this meeting.

43:58.814 --> 44:07.148
She said, I've now seen the face of institutional racism in this library among some of your union officials, and I am disgusted.

44:07.428 --> 44:11.956
Well, can this be documented by, are there things that they're not buying that they should be buying?

44:12.316 --> 44:14.179
I mean, are they not buying Toni Morrison?

44:14.299 --> 44:15.301
Are they not buying anything?

44:15.321 --> 44:20.209
See, I don't think this is, I do not think that this is a rank-and-file issue.

44:21.337 --> 44:24.440
I think most people in the library are wonderful.

44:25.362 --> 44:29.126
I think some of the staff was really, really talented.

44:29.146 --> 44:35.353
I think you're dealing with a handful of people who have control of the guild in the last two years.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.436
What am I supposed to tell people?

44:39.217 --> 44:43.081
One of our African-American donors, we just live it after one of these meetings.

44:43.842 --> 44:45.604
And we had to try to calm him down.

44:46.005 --> 44:48.087
The comments that were being made in the audience

44:48.860 --> 44:50.442
by the activists that showed up.

44:50.662 --> 44:53.706
Some of these included the non-Library Guild people.

44:55.268 --> 45:03.038
But the impression is clearly that we're quite happy with the way things are.

45:03.959 --> 45:08.625
We, the library staff, will make the decisions on what people need.

45:08.645 --> 45:13.451
We do not need anyone else coming in and interfering with the way we will run this institution.

45:13.811 --> 45:15.994
It's an ivory tower kind of an approach.

45:16.054 --> 45:18.597
It's an inward-looking approach.

45:19.235 --> 45:26.366
an approach that does not deal with the kind of diversity we're trying to bring in the institution.

45:26.786 --> 45:46.396
This commission, which is composed of seven donors, and is a majority of people of color, and I'll throw myself in as a gay man, we are really upset with the kind of stuff we heard last year and that we sometimes still hear coming up.

45:46.416 --> 45:48.499
And I got hard feelings on some of it, yeah.

45:48.732 --> 45:52.257
I think some of these people are absolutely destructive on the institution.

45:52.737 --> 45:56.402
And they're not there representing the need of the institution.

45:57.504 --> 45:59.807
They're representing their own personal power play.

46:00.628 --> 46:01.609
And I am damned at it.

46:02.130 --> 46:04.193
I am disgusted with them.

46:04.213 --> 46:06.155
And if I use hard language, so what?

46:06.476 --> 46:08.579
And they're coming at me on this kind of stuff.

46:08.859 --> 46:09.560
Yeah.

46:09.580 --> 46:10.721
Does this piss you off?

46:11.122 --> 46:14.306
No, I look at it as being the kind of petty level that we are at.

46:14.687 --> 46:17.170
I mean, I try not to engage them in these meetings.

46:17.690 --> 46:21.334
But we hear from, you know, our commission meetings are a joke.

46:21.354 --> 46:22.655
We hear from about ten people.

46:23.596 --> 46:25.718
You know, you hear the same people over and over again.

46:25.738 --> 46:28.080
It makes it very difficult to do what you need to do.

46:28.120 --> 46:30.723
But we're trying to, you know, one piece by piece.

46:31.203 --> 46:34.166
Today I have a new secretary on the commission to start.

46:34.186 --> 46:43.995
I have to get somebody who is really political, really tough, that can deal with these folks, the gadflies that are out there, and the lawsuits and requests for information.

46:44.336 --> 46:46.718
I've now got a first-rate interim librarian there.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.202
I hope she stays for a long time.

46:49.222 --> 46:52.606
I'm frankly not in a big rush to find a replacement for her.

46:52.626 --> 46:56.530
And who's doing a search for the criminal, by the way?

46:56.750 --> 46:59.193
We're not in the midst of a search at the moment.

46:59.554 --> 47:00.054
Really?

47:00.074 --> 47:01.716
So she's a— We like her.

47:03.878 --> 47:14.190
We couldn't launch a search until the budget came out in July, and the mayor doesn't think we need a search.

47:15.217 --> 47:26.053
We, because of domestic partners' issues and other complexities, dealing with the local contracting has made it more difficult.

47:26.434 --> 47:27.535
But we're not in a big rush.

47:28.356 --> 47:39.553
We think we've found a great person to sit there because, again, we believe that we've got to solve some of the problems before we're going to be able to bring in a really top-notch permanent person.

47:39.994 --> 47:45.021
Nobody's going to want to do it until we have tamed some of the tigers that people see us here.

47:45.676 --> 47:49.822
But, I mean, if you look in this book, I mean, the library has always been one that's done it on its own.

47:50.423 --> 47:53.428
The city has never stood there for the library system.

47:53.908 --> 48:03.863
It's been, well, from Carnegie money, building the old main library, to different people who brought in different collections and friends organizing in the 60s.

48:03.883 --> 48:09.051
You know, Marjorie Stern, who I think is one of the great heroines of the library system.

48:09.402 --> 48:12.605
involved for 40 years on the fight for the new Maine Library.

48:12.845 --> 48:13.726
They're wonderful people.

48:14.046 --> 48:17.189
But it's been a grassroots kind of thing, making it happen.

48:17.829 --> 48:24.315
You know, coming back to the union again, the union... You know, I'm going to have to ask them point blank.

48:24.375 --> 48:27.378
Nobody has told me that they're opposed to private money.

48:27.798 --> 48:34.144
I've created allegations about the telephone company and all this, and I keep saying, well, you know, show me something.

48:34.164 --> 48:37.587
You know, it's easy to say...

48:37.938 --> 48:50.131
Melissa Riley, two months ago, at the first meeting that Gina was at, said she'd like to raise a million dollars to upgrade the online system.

48:50.151 --> 48:50.792
Who said that?

48:50.812 --> 48:51.313
Gina.

48:51.333 --> 48:51.453
Right.

48:51.473 --> 48:51.813
Who said that?

48:52.394 --> 48:57.279
And I said, I think you'd have to do some homework before you get in.

48:57.299 --> 48:59.782
Because she said, let's go to downtown business and have them.

49:00.142 --> 49:00.342
Gina says.

49:00.362 --> 49:05.548
Gina said this, Gina Minutri, at this commission meeting.

49:06.085 --> 49:09.090
I think we could raise money, but I think it would take time.

49:09.570 --> 49:13.977
And frankly, the library staff would have to be seen as supportive.

49:14.057 --> 49:18.865
The union, the guild, has got to be seen as supportive of private money coming in the institution.

49:19.345 --> 49:26.136
Otherwise, I think we've so turned off downtown business that they're not going to get involved.

49:26.156 --> 49:33.527
And Melissa Riley, she came up as a steward, the one you've talked to, and this is last month, and said,

49:34.570 --> 49:38.236
I personally oppose private money in the library system.

49:38.296 --> 49:39.758
I think we should raise taxes.

49:40.319 --> 49:46.929
In fact, I think we should repeal Proposition 13 so that people can pay more property taxes, and that will solve the problem.

49:48.311 --> 49:56.784
When we've run into budget problems before, Beth McNair one time stood up and said, the problem is downtown business is not paying enough taxes.

49:56.804 --> 50:02.873
We need to raise taxes, you know, potentially for everybody, and keep all this private money out.

50:03.342 --> 50:04.804
You know, the fight over the MOU.

50:05.225 --> 50:08.249
Time after time, the union has taken a very clear position.

50:08.269 --> 50:10.493
No private money in this institution.

50:11.054 --> 50:30.683
Tova Singer, who's one of the activists, his library staff did an op-ed piece to examine Iran, referred to Jim Hormel as the heir to a union-busting meatpacking firm.

50:31.507 --> 50:42.963
You know, the snide comments on Charlotte Meyer's swig, who's now Charlotte Meyer, Charlotte has just married George Shultz, former Secretary of State.

50:43.164 --> 50:46.008
She's sort of, she's our protocol chief.

50:46.088 --> 50:50.114
She's sort of Mrs. Charity in San Francisco.

50:50.794 --> 50:55.681
And her and her late husband, Mel, co-chair our fundraising campaign.

50:55.701 --> 50:57.865
And, you know, we raised $35 million.

50:58.325 --> 50:59.607
You take out New York public.

51:01.257 --> 51:06.785
in a world quite by itself and as a private institution, in terms of publicly run public libraries.

51:06.805 --> 51:10.190
That's the most successful private fundraising campaign in library history.

51:11.292 --> 51:13.354
We are the envy of libraries all over the country.

51:13.895 --> 51:26.774
Yet the leaders of the Guild in the last two years, and I keep pointing out it's only been in the last two years, have been condescending, endless nasty comments.

51:28.136 --> 51:30.319
I'm attacked for my role in fundraising.

51:31.025 --> 51:45.323
you know, I've got some of our biggest minority donors, you may want to ask them, we have a letter that about ten minority donors sent to the staff, basically raising some of these racism questions.

51:47.345 --> 52:00.441
The guild response was, this is an attempt to intimidate us poor people by the rich people who are out there, and Nicholson Baker, while he was here, and they did it, and it was

52:00.674 --> 52:09.046
It never became a news article, but what you have is a real chilling effect on minority donors towards this institution.

52:09.726 --> 52:10.447
It is real.

52:11.889 --> 52:18.458
And I put the blame entirely in front of the current ill leadership.

52:18.478 --> 52:21.062
I told this to Josie Mooney, who heads

52:33.209 --> 52:36.412
I don't know what their members are.

52:36.512 --> 52:37.633
But it is a problem.

52:38.094 --> 52:47.964
I have tried, as someone who still wants to fundraise for the institution and still has belief in it, I've tried to keep a lot of these things out of the public eye.

52:49.085 --> 52:53.510
We have more of our fights in private, or they do some piece of bullshit like that.

52:53.570 --> 52:58.795
I'm hoping it doesn't come to a total blowout.

53:00.158 --> 53:05.244
But you could have a situation where basically the minority communities of this community say enough.

53:08.848 --> 53:19.059
Now, you have some of the staff is great, like the Chinatown staff just works their behinds off and is really sensitive to that community.

53:20.360 --> 53:24.305
And a lot of the minority staff are great, and a lot of the regular staff is great.

53:24.685 --> 53:29.170
When I say eight angry white women, I do that very intentionally.

53:29.808 --> 53:32.252
They are indeed that.

53:33.654 --> 53:47.195
Much like I'm the queer who sits over the Library Commission, when they attacked me for—privately, when it came back to me— This is down and dirty, you know.

53:47.215 --> 53:57.351
When they attacked me for appointing Kathy—having Dowling appoint Kathy Page as the interim librarian, and she was a lesbian, and so this was part of the homosexual agenda.

53:57.888 --> 54:05.378
to the gay mafia kind of thing, for me to get a homosexual in as the interim librarian.

54:05.739 --> 54:09.624
I mean, I was disgusted when that one came across.

54:11.767 --> 54:13.950
But yeah, so it gets down and dirty.

54:13.970 --> 54:19.778
This is contact sports in politics in San Francisco.

54:20.652 --> 54:24.657
I have tried to keep it from being personal in a public venue.

54:24.977 --> 54:28.682
Oh, Christ, it's pretty fucking personal to me.

54:28.702 --> 54:31.125
But it is, maybe that's sort of where it is.

54:32.626 --> 54:35.049
And it did not used to be that way.

54:35.310 --> 54:37.652
Nine years ago, it was not this way.

54:39.475 --> 54:41.097
Very interesting.

54:41.177 --> 54:44.741
So, I mean, I am really proud as to where we have come.

54:45.141 --> 54:47.284
You know, we have raised money.

54:47.770 --> 54:50.693
We have a $140 million building that you've been into.

54:51.394 --> 54:54.918
It came in on budget and on time.

54:55.619 --> 54:56.580
I mean, think about that.

54:56.600 --> 54:57.641
This is San Francisco.

54:58.182 --> 55:01.145
And we had to overcome unbelievable obstacles.

55:01.306 --> 55:02.747
Like I mentioned, the Pioneer Monument.

55:03.588 --> 55:15.482
That was a multi-month fight to move a derelict, basically abandoned, old piece of Victorian architecture so we could make room for an expanded children's center.

55:16.441 --> 55:21.608
And it was downright ugly on trying to move the damn thing.

55:21.628 --> 55:27.135
We had raised $750,000 privately to move it and put it in its current location.

55:27.175 --> 55:29.678
It's the monument between the old main and the new main.

55:30.098 --> 55:30.879
I think it looks great.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.424
I mean, it was sat directly in front of the old city hall.

55:34.544 --> 55:39.390
The old city hall fell down, and they moved it, you know, years later over to the current site.

55:39.691 --> 55:42.294
So it would have been in the back side of the city center.

55:42.714 --> 55:46.279
We moved it to a prime position directly in front of city hall,

55:46.715 --> 55:53.503
It's in an honorific position, and we tried once on the ballot, we'll probably try again, to turn that into a little park-like setting, that street.

55:54.684 --> 55:55.945
But that was a horrible fight.

55:55.965 --> 56:00.330
I mean, you would not believe the historians calling us names and that kind of stuff.

56:00.350 --> 56:01.992
Really down and dirty, very personal.

56:02.052 --> 56:06.597
So I saw one other thing at you that people ask me.

56:07.398 --> 56:12.704
They ask Steve Folder, what do you mean?

56:12.724 --> 56:14.626
Do you have a library card?

56:15.067 --> 56:16.148
I have a library card.

56:16.482 --> 56:20.207
No, I mean, it's perfectly reasonable.

56:20.747 --> 56:22.790
I read three newspapers a day.

56:22.810 --> 56:26.935
I have two news magazines a week that I also subscribe to.

56:28.016 --> 56:30.700
I read a great deal of science fiction.

56:30.720 --> 56:35.326
I probably have half a dozen books at any time that I am reading.

56:35.526 --> 56:36.267
I like books.

56:36.808 --> 56:38.890
I do not consider myself an intellectual.

56:39.351 --> 56:44.397
I do not consider myself, you know, a great collector of books, although I have

56:44.714 --> 56:48.998
My office at home is two floor-to-ceiling walls just full of books.

56:51.480 --> 56:52.501
You know, I like to read.

56:52.602 --> 56:55.024
I consider myself very pro-book.

56:55.064 --> 56:59.148
They think I'm anti-book and I'm only technology.

56:59.468 --> 57:02.891
I think it looks at me really one-dimensional.

57:02.971 --> 57:10.038
I was amused when it was posed to me, but I think it's a fair question to ask.

57:10.519 --> 57:13.962
Given the perception of the San Francisco Libraries with that tape

57:14.245 --> 57:15.947
of being the library of the future.

57:16.388 --> 57:19.451
And then you have this other problem with books going off to the dump.

57:20.252 --> 57:21.734
Maybe they don't care about books.

57:22.195 --> 57:23.937
I don't think that's the case at all.

57:24.898 --> 57:32.027
But these are questions that somebody from the outside might want to ask.

57:32.047 --> 57:37.013
So I think that for that reason the question is worth asking.

57:37.280 --> 57:39.522
I mean, I didn't even want to come back on the Library Commission.

57:39.542 --> 57:42.224
Yeah, tell me, you mentioned earlier that you were fired from the Commission.

57:42.245 --> 57:42.865
Is that what you said?

57:42.925 --> 57:44.807
Oh, we had a big fight with Jordan.

57:44.847 --> 57:46.548
Jordan actually— Jordan being old.

57:46.568 --> 57:49.531
Jordan was the mayor that defeated— What's his first name?

57:49.811 --> 57:50.152
Frank.

57:50.272 --> 57:51.453
Frank Jordan.

57:51.473 --> 57:54.976
A really nice guy, totally over his head as being mayor.

57:55.256 --> 57:59.840
He was a former police chief, Feinstein's police chief.

57:59.860 --> 58:07.067
Anyway, defeated Agnos in a squeaker, a super-vendetta film election between competing

58:07.267 --> 58:08.970
campaign managers who hated each other.

58:09.751 --> 58:10.352
It was horrible.

58:11.974 --> 58:24.052
He reappointed me to the commission, asked me to stay, but he put in someone else's president, which was just fine, Jim Herlihy, whom I did not get along with.

58:25.093 --> 58:29.199
And the library budget was continuing to decline.

58:29.740 --> 58:30.661
They hadn't opened the new main.

58:30.681 --> 58:32.464
We were still trying to build up, and the challenge was to

58:33.018 --> 58:42.087
How do you build a fairly bold vision of where you want to take the institution, build a new main library, raise $35 million privately?

58:42.568 --> 58:48.353
At the same time, the reality is each year, in a practical sense, you're getting less money.

58:48.854 --> 58:55.240
Pay wages, wage raises, lift it up, but basically you got less money each year.

58:55.721 --> 58:58.203
And we had some branches open 20 hours a week.

58:59.405 --> 59:02.788
We were at about a million dollars a year in materials.

59:03.460 --> 59:07.164
that we were buying each year, it was ridiculous.

59:07.965 --> 59:18.155
And the mayor came up with a new proposal, which was publicly we were only supposed to discuss another $250,000 cut.

59:19.216 --> 59:22.340
Privately we were to take another million dollar cut.

59:22.360 --> 59:29.507
And the argument went around was basically eliminate the book collection, you know, any new materials.

59:29.848 --> 59:31.189
That'll save you a million dollars.

59:31.625 --> 59:35.690
We need to wind down, even lower some of the branches.

59:35.710 --> 59:39.354
The mayor took the position that we will not close a branch.

59:40.435 --> 59:43.359
If it's only open five hours a week, it's still open.

59:44.740 --> 59:50.808
If the president of the commission's position was only open an hour a week, it's still open, technically open.

59:50.828 --> 59:55.273
So we may only be in a technical sense in terms of open, but all 27 branches will be open.

59:55.873 --> 59:57.335
And the commission basically revealed.

59:58.657 --> 59:59.758
We said, that's insane.

59:59.818 --> 01:00:01.480
The middle class is going to walk away

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:02.913
from the public library.

01:00:04.074 --> 01:00:10.260
For many kids in all the years that we've been involved, they have never seen a quality library in San Francisco.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.482
The money is only going in one direction.

01:00:12.502 --> 01:00:13.583
It's less and less.

01:00:13.603 --> 01:00:16.145
The number of materials we're buying is getting lower and lower.

01:00:16.906 --> 01:00:19.168
Just the quality of service is getting worse and worse.

01:00:19.888 --> 01:00:26.794
And if you continue these kind of cuts and if you go to five hours a week on some of your branches, you know, why is a middle class going to stick?

01:00:27.615 --> 01:00:30.758
You know, there's articles about people giving up on the public school system.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:33.510
Are they going to do that to the public libraries?

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:37.815
We actually had what I thought was a very difficult commission to be on.

01:00:37.995 --> 01:00:43.580
It had the wife of the CEO of Bank of America was one of the people on it.

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:50.267
It had Rosalind Swig of the Fairmont chain, who was Charlotte Swig's sister-in-law.

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:57.054
And it had a number of others who was conservative.

01:00:57.074 --> 01:01:00.778
I was too liberal as a liberal Democrat.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.462
But the mayor liked it.

01:01:02.482 --> 01:01:08.770
But anyway, six to one, we voted that if the mayor was going to cut a million dollars, then we needed to close the branches.

01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:26.232
And we needed to then, the position was basically, let's do really first-rate, top-quality library service that would make any system proud in a dozen branches and maybe close the list.

01:01:26.252 --> 01:01:29.837
Or if we can do it in 18 branches, great.

01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:37.691
Let's find an alternative use for the, you know, during emergency.

01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:40.174
Turn them into senior citizen centers or something.

01:01:40.474 --> 01:01:45.039
Some of the branches were a little more than that anyway, which is fine.

01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:47.301
But anyway, so there was a big fight over it.

01:01:47.341 --> 01:01:50.705
It was seen as defying the mayor, so we fired six of us.

01:01:50.725 --> 01:01:57.132
And then what started was a protracted argument within the public, of which I was part of, is when is a library a library?

01:01:57.573 --> 01:01:59.875
When is open open?

01:02:00.226 --> 01:02:04.671
You know, five hours a week, I mean, that's a shell game.

01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:05.271
Well, that's ridiculous.

01:02:05.512 --> 01:02:06.072
It's ridiculous.

01:02:06.453 --> 01:02:14.381
The mayor's position was, you know, as long as it's open any length of time, it is open, and I will not be a mayor to close branches.

01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:17.865
But he was a mayor who was willing to eliminate the book budget.

01:02:17.885 --> 01:02:20.868
He actually made the statement at one point, they got a lot of books.

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:21.809
Now, which mayor?

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:22.570
This is Mayor Jordan.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.131
What do you need more books for?

01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:24.912
He got a lot of books.

01:02:25.953 --> 01:02:26.554
He said that.

01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:31.023
He took a hell of a lot of heat.

01:02:33.427 --> 01:02:40.098
And the library community did not back him in the election which he faced Willie Brown.

01:02:40.979 --> 01:02:42.622
So then Willie brought you back?

01:02:42.642 --> 01:02:44.145
Mm-hmm.

01:02:44.165 --> 01:02:47.530
The library community, the friends of the library and the
