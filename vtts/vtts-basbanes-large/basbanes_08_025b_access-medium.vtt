00:04.604 --> 00:11.653
It becomes extraordinarily political.

00:11.714 --> 00:14.437
It's a very political question.

00:14.457 --> 00:24.931
It's a political question about who does the earth belong to and how do they use it?

00:24.951 --> 00:27.675
Do you have an answer for that?

00:27.892 --> 00:32.821
It is the most fundamental question.

00:32.841 --> 00:34.183
No, of course I don't have an answer.

00:34.203 --> 00:42.859
Nobody's got an answer to that.

00:43.581 --> 00:48.229
An Indian point of view on the Plains,

00:48.597 --> 01:01.344
is that these great plains that they stretch from the center of Montana all the way to Iowa.

01:01.364 --> 01:05.813
The Wonkintonkin, which is their word for God,

01:06.130 --> 01:33.758
set this up for us and there would be buffalo running and we could hunt and it's extraordinarily selfish view i know it's politically correct and people want to support the indians basically what indians are asking for when they bring these arguments forward is

01:35.138 --> 01:48.758
This land is ours, we want it to be Buffalo, we're gonna live on it, and they're talking about a very few thousand people at most, as opposed to how many people could this land support.

01:51.522 --> 01:59.413
It's very easy to get caught up in a romantic Indian point of view, and many people do, and me too.

02:01.015 --> 02:03.559
I'm not immune from this.

02:04.737 --> 02:15.814
But meanwhile you got thousands and thousands and thousands of Europeans that are looking for land.

02:18.257 --> 02:23.345
And who are coming over here and who want land.

02:23.445 --> 02:33.360
And they're going to make farms and they're going to make a living and they're going to make their contribution and they're going to sell their produce and their work as a human being.

02:33.340 --> 02:37.544
And they're human beings just as much as those Indians are.

02:39.967 --> 02:54.001
And whether a Pawnee tribe riding over a piece of land once every 12 months owns that land, or a farmer will come over from the Rhineland owns that land.

02:54.521 --> 03:01.288
Those are difficult questions in morality.

03:01.893 --> 03:04.817
They're obviously not decided by morality.

03:04.838 --> 03:06.140
They're decided by force.

03:07.301 --> 03:09.264
Which is why you study them.

03:09.304 --> 03:11.448
That's exactly why I study them.

03:12.249 --> 03:16.796
And the Indians who held the land when the white men came, held it by force.

03:18.218 --> 03:25.369
There was not exactly a new principle that

03:26.952 --> 03:38.747
The Sioux who had conquered this land are now going to be pushed aside by Custer and the 7th Cavalry as the vanguard of the white men that are coming because the Sioux had taken it by force.

03:38.807 --> 03:41.890
I mean, they had no goddamn ancestral claim in this land.

03:44.073 --> 03:52.183
I'm about ready to turn this goddamn thing off.
