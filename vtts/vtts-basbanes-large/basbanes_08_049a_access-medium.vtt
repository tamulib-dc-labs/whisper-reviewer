00:03.659 --> 00:14.268
Well, congratulations on your book.

00:14.448 --> 00:14.889
Thank you.

00:16.210 --> 00:17.871
It is, what, 23 years old?

00:18.232 --> 00:18.492
Yep.

00:18.512 --> 00:21.815
This must be the first question everybody asks.

00:21.835 --> 00:23.276
Well, I'll be 24 on Sunday.

00:26.619 --> 00:30.683
This started as a project in your sophomore college.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.204
I was a junior.

00:32.684 --> 00:33.345
I was a junior.

00:33.680 --> 00:42.554
I was working in Harrisburg at the time, and I went to school about 40 miles away from there, and I had problems getting workshop into my schedule.

00:43.896 --> 00:51.968
So I begged and pleaded and got my professor, Robert Olmsted, to agree with an infinite study, and that's where this started.

00:53.951 --> 01:01.342
I struck a deal for 30 pages by the end of the semester, by December, and he wasn't going to check up on me or anything.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.404
It was just 30 pages.

01:02.840 --> 01:12.192
So by October I had a good sentence, and November I had a paragraph, and December I had a page and a half, and Christmas Vacation comes and goes.

01:12.212 --> 01:15.076
But it didn't start as a novel, right?

01:15.096 --> 01:18.741
Well, I knew at the time when I was working on it that it would be something longer.

01:18.781 --> 01:24.168
I'd had a workshop this spring prior where I'd written a novella, about 90 pages at work.

01:24.208 --> 01:28.273
So I was real comfortable with that long, long form.

01:29.283 --> 01:32.488
I don't think I considered a novel.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.313
I don't think I really thought that far.

01:35.373 --> 01:37.297
And you were in which school?

01:37.317 --> 01:37.737
Dickinson?

01:37.777 --> 01:38.158
Dickinson.

01:38.178 --> 01:38.779
And where is that?

01:38.799 --> 01:39.881
Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

01:39.921 --> 01:41.103
Is that close to Allentown?

01:41.684 --> 01:43.066
Allentown's about two hours.

01:43.106 --> 01:45.691
Allentown's two hours towards New York.

01:46.993 --> 01:47.133
Okay.

01:47.213 --> 01:49.277
Allentown takes me sometimes.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.459
There's an angle.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.843
Yeah, well, I live...

01:53.009 --> 01:55.493
Actually, now I'm Pennsylvania, right outside of State College.

01:55.973 --> 01:58.777
I went to graduate school.

01:58.797 --> 01:59.598
Oh, really?

01:59.799 --> 02:01.781
My husband goes to graduate.

02:01.802 --> 02:02.543
How's the paper there?

02:03.724 --> 02:04.125
Tiny.

02:04.405 --> 02:05.286
Do they do any of the books?

02:05.967 --> 02:07.410
No, rarely.

02:07.690 --> 02:10.854
I don't even read it.

02:11.736 --> 02:14.700
It's often hard when they're too small.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.444
What I've done is really target these university towns.

02:18.445 --> 02:21.109
So I'm in Eugene or

02:21.832 --> 02:22.713
Charlottesville.

02:22.813 --> 02:23.535
A lot of Southern papers.

02:23.555 --> 02:24.917
Charlottesville has a great paper.

02:25.137 --> 02:26.018
It really does.

02:26.038 --> 02:27.501
I'm so pleased to be in there.

02:27.521 --> 02:29.263
They have book columnists every week.

02:29.464 --> 02:30.786
Oh, great.

02:30.806 --> 02:33.790
And then Knoxville every week.

02:33.810 --> 02:35.893
And then Jackson, Gainesville.

02:35.933 --> 02:36.294
Oh, yeah?

02:36.514 --> 02:40.320
The Bills, Knoxville, Gainesville, Australia.

02:40.340 --> 02:41.201
All the university towns, you know.

02:41.221 --> 02:43.545
And Austin will take this, Austin, Texas.

02:43.585 --> 02:47.030
So it's a pretty big spread of papers.

02:47.050 --> 02:49.594
But it is, anyway, to get back to the

02:50.232 --> 02:53.396
to go back to the narrative.

02:53.637 --> 02:58.263
So you live in State College, so your husband is a graduate student?

02:58.323 --> 02:59.385
Yeah, he's getting his PhD.

02:59.806 --> 03:00.066
In what?

03:00.326 --> 03:02.930
Spanish literature.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.535
And I guess from some of the stuff I read, there was a deadline here, right?

03:06.916 --> 03:13.225
Yeah, I was bound and determined to have a son before I graduated, and then I graduated.

03:13.265 --> 03:16.549
So then it was before I got married.

03:16.589 --> 03:17.050
And I did.

03:17.485 --> 03:20.710
Now, you kept saying that you didn't get it done, you didn't get it done.

03:20.890 --> 03:23.074
I mean, it was a problem.

03:23.094 --> 03:24.135
That was a great problem.

03:24.896 --> 03:26.379
In terms of motivation?

03:26.439 --> 03:26.739
No.

03:27.981 --> 03:29.564
Again, I was real busy.

03:30.144 --> 03:39.038
I had full load classes and I was working about 30 hours a week and had a sizable commute.

03:40.553 --> 03:48.026
So I was always thinking about it, and I had my heart in it, but I just wasn't getting the time as a typewriter that I wanted.

03:48.046 --> 03:49.489
So it started when you were a sophomore?

03:49.689 --> 03:50.691
Junior.

03:50.711 --> 03:51.673
It followed my junior year.

03:51.873 --> 03:54.298
You were 20 or so?

03:54.318 --> 03:54.518
Yep.

03:54.538 --> 03:59.006
And it was a senior project?

03:59.166 --> 04:00.348
No.

04:00.409 --> 04:02.933
It was just for an independent study.

04:03.284 --> 04:14.118
What happened, I finally did get it turned in, and a couple weeks later I get a really terse message from Robert Olmsted on my answering machine telling me to get over to his office now.

04:15.220 --> 04:20.066
And I'm thinking, he's failed me, because like the 30th page I ended mid-sentence.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.190
It was 30 pages exactly.

04:23.210 --> 04:29.899
And I knew I had a lot more work to do on it just for myself, and knew it would be longer.

04:30.385 --> 04:37.134
So I go Terran over to his house, and he tells me that he sent the first page of it up to New York, and people lied to them.

04:37.354 --> 04:40.879
Yeah, he just sent the first page, the opening, there's the opening paragraph.

04:42.581 --> 04:44.204
Wow, and that's the same?

04:44.224 --> 04:45.605
Same opening paragraph, yeah.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.349
And he sent this to Amanda Urban?

04:48.429 --> 04:50.933
Sent it to Amanda Urban, who was his agent.

04:52.795 --> 04:55.379
She's a very high-powered agent.

04:55.399 --> 04:55.659
Yeah, she is.

04:55.679 --> 04:56.460
She's very young.

04:57.233 --> 04:58.154
She gets things done.

04:58.755 --> 05:00.677
Yeah, I'm really impressed that she would take on.

05:01.658 --> 05:03.280
She didn't actually take me on.

05:04.241 --> 05:09.947
She recommended, well, of course, I had 30 unpolished pages, and I was 20 years old.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.851
I could be 10 years writing that book, and she knew that.

05:13.431 --> 05:19.438
And she had a young agent working for at the time, Gordon Kato, and K-A-T-O.

05:20.479 --> 05:26.346
And he took me on, called me up, just said he'd...

05:26.579 --> 05:38.630
I worked up with that movement that I turned into my independent study by February, I guess, the next year, and he read those 45 or so pages, and he just encouraged me beyond belief.

05:38.690 --> 05:40.352
He had a lot of faith.

05:40.372 --> 05:45.076
And a couple years, about 18 months later, I sent him the manuscript.

05:45.256 --> 05:50.561
I did a lot of editing for him, much more so than I did for Janet, actually.

05:50.761 --> 05:52.683
I'd love to know Janet Silver.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.865
Janet Silver, my editor here.

05:56.549 --> 05:58.291
And, uh, name of the teacher again?

05:58.532 --> 05:59.513
Robert Olmsted.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.155
How do you spell it?

06:01.395 --> 06:02.356
O-L-M-S-T-E-A-D.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.038
Now, is he a published writer?

06:04.059 --> 06:06.281
Oh, yeah, he's got, uh, five novels.

06:06.301 --> 06:10.206
Uh, four novels, and he just, he's coming out with a memoir, uh, this month.

06:10.226 --> 06:13.130
So, was this his agent that he sent it to?

06:13.350 --> 06:16.955
Yes, it was his agent, and his editor at the time, David Rosenthal.

06:17.015 --> 06:17.736
So he was a novel?

06:17.776 --> 06:18.317
David Rosenthal.

06:18.337 --> 06:18.877
Oh, I see.

06:19.198 --> 06:21.080
Yeah, because that is kind of an extraordinary.

06:21.401 --> 06:24.524
Well, yeah, yeah, it is, it was a, it was a real fluke thing.

06:24.545 --> 06:25.746
So, in your mind,

06:26.030 --> 06:28.212
You figured this was a project?

06:28.232 --> 06:33.578
That was, I mean, I knew that I was in this for the long haul.

06:33.678 --> 06:37.381
I wanted to work as a writer.

06:37.602 --> 06:39.463
That's why I was in college.

06:40.424 --> 06:42.126
What were you studying?

06:42.146 --> 06:42.507
English.

06:43.948 --> 06:45.790
And then you said that's what you were studying.

06:45.810 --> 06:45.910
Yeah.

06:46.130 --> 06:53.978
They had a, I knew when I applied to Dickinson, they had a writer in residence, Robert Homestead, and he worked very closely with his students.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.060
pretty much drawn to the school for that reason.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.325
So this is really one of those instances where the writer does something.

07:00.345 --> 07:00.805
Oh, yeah.

07:01.266 --> 07:01.626
Oh, yeah.

07:01.646 --> 07:02.788
It doesn't happen at all.

07:02.808 --> 07:05.491
Well, Bob really did.

07:05.511 --> 07:10.317
I'm not putting this in my story, but that's usually a good gig for somebody.

07:10.337 --> 07:12.379
Well, from what I understand, yeah.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.181
Yeah, it's a nice way to get paid.

07:14.241 --> 07:15.743
And come in once a week.

07:16.604 --> 07:16.724
Yeah.

07:16.985 --> 07:19.788
No, he pulled out all the stops for me.

07:19.808 --> 07:21.690
And he's a fantastic writer.

07:22.451 --> 07:23.172
Is he still there?

07:23.371 --> 07:26.396
He just retired this year.

07:27.017 --> 07:29.080
His wife took another job.

07:29.781 --> 07:31.925
That's really amazing.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.671
Did you have hopes that you would be a fiction writer or a journalist?

07:35.731 --> 07:37.273
I didn't want to work in journalism.

07:37.353 --> 07:41.059
I wanted to work with books, fiction.

07:41.180 --> 07:46.528
I just didn't expect it this fast.

07:46.729 --> 07:49.513
I figured this was going to be some hard years.

07:50.438 --> 07:52.080
And then, of course, the awarding.

07:52.100 --> 07:55.545
I mean, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the Hope Miller Foundation Fellowship.

07:56.066 --> 07:56.226
Really?

07:56.787 --> 07:57.908
Yeah, that was such a pride.

07:57.928 --> 08:07.762
You know, I mean, it's just, I've got my next 14 columns booked, I take, you know, one out of 10, maybe.

08:07.782 --> 08:08.083
Yeah.

08:09.004 --> 08:12.209
I mean, so the cachet of this thing is really quite extraordinary.

08:12.229 --> 08:12.529
Yes.

08:12.629 --> 08:15.433
For the company you're in, I mean, does that intimidate you at all?

08:16.173 --> 08:18.335
Yeah.

08:18.435 --> 08:19.236
Yes, yes.

08:19.256 --> 08:21.038
I was shocked.

08:21.058 --> 08:21.558
I really was.

08:21.798 --> 08:23.820
Janet, the award was a total surprise.

08:24.441 --> 08:28.485
And when Janet called me, she says, I've won this award, and I'd never heard of it.

08:29.646 --> 08:30.767
And I say, yeah.

08:30.787 --> 08:35.211
The last time I was given, you were probably 14.

08:35.531 --> 08:36.552
Yeah.

08:37.473 --> 08:41.437
And so she says, Robert Penn Warren, and I just.

08:41.457 --> 08:42.298
Oh, Elizabeth Bishop.

08:42.478 --> 08:43.078
I know.

08:43.599 --> 08:45.000
In fact, I did Ethan Canaan.

08:45.020 --> 08:45.741
Really?

08:46.126 --> 08:50.890
They've done it a couple times, but it was cooking on the storage.

08:52.111 --> 08:52.432
Yes.

08:53.773 --> 08:56.535
Yeah, it was the last time they did it.

08:56.555 --> 08:58.417
God, it is an extraordinary company.

08:58.517 --> 08:59.618
What's the first printing?

08:59.638 --> 09:02.020
Do you know offhand?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.621
No, I don't.

09:03.641 --> 09:04.042
I don't.

09:04.062 --> 09:05.143
As I recall, it was large.

09:05.663 --> 09:07.144
It seemed awful big to me.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.105
I don't recall.

09:08.626 --> 09:10.888
I think it was between 15 and 20.

09:10.908 --> 09:12.709
Yeah, well, that's wonderful.

09:12.729 --> 09:12.970
Is it?

09:15.372 --> 09:15.812
Great.

09:16.062 --> 09:20.025
20,000 is quite wonderful, actually.

09:20.045 --> 09:21.326
I hope it sells 20,000.

09:21.386 --> 09:21.787
Me too.

09:21.807 --> 09:31.275
For the first novel, I just had a book published last summer, and my first print was 6700.

09:31.535 --> 09:32.316
Oh, that's great.

09:32.396 --> 09:34.017
Oh, fantastic.

09:34.137 --> 09:35.458
It's not a novel.

09:35.478 --> 09:41.103
In fact, it was shortlisted for the international book review.

09:41.183 --> 09:41.603
Really?

09:42.024 --> 09:42.764
What's the title?

09:42.784 --> 09:44.146
It's about bibliomania.

09:44.286 --> 09:45.867
It's called The Gentle Madness.

09:46.657 --> 10:13.879
neat that's a fascinating subject though i spent eight years on books anyway um but that's that's spectacular yeah so um is your editor now are you working on something else or um not specifically with uh colton misland i am working on another novel i'd like to finish it before i i made any calls with with um

10:15.631 --> 10:16.992
what's going to happen to it.

10:17.012 --> 10:20.276
You know, I'd rather work with a finished book.

10:21.057 --> 10:21.277
Right.

10:21.297 --> 10:23.419
But you're not working with a editor at all.

10:23.439 --> 10:23.739
I know.

10:24.060 --> 10:24.360
I know.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.662
I guess I like that.

10:26.282 --> 10:39.156
I'm working on this book the way that I did coming up through college, and I've worked very closely with Robert Olmsted, so I'd like to try this on my own, I think.

10:39.176 --> 10:40.457
I'd like to

10:41.450 --> 10:44.575
you know, sort of beat myself over the head.

10:44.595 --> 10:53.609
The good part of that is that you won't have the pressure of a contract saying, you know, it's not like getting a paper in for a teacher.

10:53.629 --> 10:54.010
Yeah.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.232
You've got a contract.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.315
It's legal.

10:57.435 --> 10:58.577
Yeah, and they're giving you money.

10:58.777 --> 10:59.078
Right.

10:59.098 --> 11:06.269
You know, I just got, in my first book, I had a very small advance, you know, and I was having nothing, you know.

11:06.329 --> 11:06.870
Yeah.

11:06.890 --> 11:07.651
Just published me.

11:07.771 --> 11:08.132
Yeah.

11:08.152 --> 11:08.993
And this is what happens, you know.

11:09.817 --> 11:14.743
But this one, because of the performance, I got a very good advance.

11:14.763 --> 11:15.423
Really wonderful.

11:15.563 --> 11:16.124
Great.

11:17.446 --> 11:23.633
And there would have been more if I dropped it, but I wanted to stay with the same idea when they had the publishing house, which is Holden.

11:23.653 --> 11:24.574
Oh, they're great.

11:24.654 --> 11:26.696
Actually, they're bringing out Bach's books.

11:26.716 --> 11:27.076
Are they?

11:27.096 --> 11:29.940
Metropolitan Books, you know, the new imprint.

11:30.080 --> 11:30.320
Oh, yeah.

11:30.340 --> 11:33.083
And who's his editor?

11:33.103 --> 11:34.845
Reva, Reva Hoppock.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.207
Okay, yeah, I'm going to have a few books.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.970
In fact, I'll ask you to describe my own books.

11:38.990 --> 11:39.250
Certainly.

11:39.854 --> 11:48.807
Whatever I do as an author that I'm interested in, I get another book and I give him my little present.

11:48.827 --> 11:49.568
Oh, that's nice.

11:49.969 --> 11:52.112
He's really a sweetheart.

11:52.132 --> 11:53.815
If you don't mind why jumping around.

11:53.875 --> 11:54.556
Of course not.

11:55.077 --> 11:59.723
I understand that fiction does usually speak for itself.

11:59.763 --> 12:06.874
We will talk about it, obviously, because to write a novel at such an early age,

12:07.732 --> 12:14.902
undoubtedly you had to draw on a lot of your own biographical elements.

12:14.922 --> 12:15.483
Not really.

12:16.144 --> 12:20.129
I heard the story about the vineyard, of course, that resonates to some degree.

12:20.269 --> 12:21.691
Well, of course it would.

12:22.052 --> 12:28.461
And something like a vineyard is a setting that I don't think you'd have much knowledge about unless you've been in one.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.744
I'm just checking.

12:30.764 --> 12:31.124
Go ahead.

12:31.144 --> 12:31.986
Okay.

12:33.047 --> 12:36.692
It's funny, I just was asked that question almost in reverse.

12:37.043 --> 12:42.997
that how could surely a writer so young wouldn't have much experience to draw from.

12:44.059 --> 12:48.629
You can answer that for me.

12:49.030 --> 12:55.525
And something else that sort of came up was people that know me that have read the book have

12:56.095 --> 13:07.729
never gone through it and said, well, I know who that person really is, or I know who that character really is, and I know who that's based on, because it's not really, there's lots of names that I borrowed from my dad's hometown.

13:07.749 --> 13:23.267
He grew up in a small, southern town, and I suppose I borrowed a lot of the towns, too, but lots of names I borrowed, and, of course, the vineyards, just that setting, I would get that, but as far as the characters, I think,

13:24.749 --> 13:29.016
I think they stand on their own.

13:31.761 --> 13:33.804
She thinks a lot of the way I think.

13:38.572 --> 13:41.477
She has some qualities that I truly admire.

13:42.018 --> 13:50.031
She is at times bullheaded and certainly very strong-willed.

13:52.238 --> 13:58.007
contemplative and peace with herself, I think.

13:58.027 --> 14:00.512
And I admire that.

14:01.393 --> 14:14.314
Maybe I do wish I could be more like that.

14:14.699 --> 14:25.308
And I was talking about Harris before, too, when I asked him if he was based on my husband, because my husband is a grad student, and Harris is a grad student.

14:25.890 --> 14:30.683
And I think there's perhaps where I know how a grad student works.

14:31.658 --> 14:33.441
I know how a farmer works.

14:34.143 --> 14:36.848
I know how these things work.

14:36.948 --> 14:39.713
So they're easy attributes to give to characters.

14:40.033 --> 14:43.079
I'm working on a character now who's a nurse, my mother.

14:43.099 --> 14:47.026
So I get all the nitty-gritty details of how that works.

14:47.848 --> 14:50.072
But the character's not my mom.

14:50.052 --> 14:53.797
I have a brother and sister both younger.

14:53.817 --> 14:57.642
My sister's got a picture on the back of the book.

14:57.762 --> 14:58.282
Oh, really?

14:58.463 --> 14:58.563
Yeah.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.566
She's a great photographer.

15:02.708 --> 15:03.148
Nothing?

15:03.429 --> 15:03.929
Yeah.

15:04.630 --> 15:09.777
I think it's kind of fun.

15:09.997 --> 15:10.898
I do, too.

15:12.981 --> 15:17.967
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

15:19.145 --> 15:42.520
Well, I don't think that's it.

15:50.583 --> 16:02.803
Thank you so much.

16:04.066 --> 16:12.723
The first step I had with him was last month.

16:12.783 --> 16:18.855
And I turned in a story and I had a conference with him.

16:18.875 --> 16:22.001
I went in and he sat at himself and said that the story is very good.

16:22.021 --> 16:25.648
It was the last time you hear that.

16:25.668 --> 16:26.530
And it was the last time I ever heard that.

16:27.775 --> 16:42.290
Well, apparently, he's just decided that was the way he was going to go about teaching him.

16:42.310 --> 16:46.234
As a teacher and a coach, I know John Barnes was listening to him, right?

16:46.334 --> 16:49.017
Maybe, maybe so.

16:49.137 --> 16:52.160
I was wondering, you know, if he, in fact, how do you think that you learned this?

16:52.440 --> 16:54.222
I don't know if there's a distinction, but maybe there is.

16:54.573 --> 16:59.407
It's been about three years since I got a formal workshop with him.

16:59.748 --> 17:02.336
But he does not deal with rules.

17:02.997 --> 17:04.241
He does not deal with rules.

17:04.502 --> 17:07.350
These are the things you have to know.

17:08.410 --> 17:15.797
So yeah, I think a coach maybe is a good chance for it.

17:15.977 --> 17:17.078
Oh yeah.

17:17.238 --> 17:26.928
And I have grown to depend on that kind of medicine just to the bone.

17:26.948 --> 17:28.369
You don't have to put it to me gently.

17:29.170 --> 17:32.333
And were there things like that in this book?

17:33.794 --> 17:36.477
Actually, more of that

17:37.486 --> 17:59.089
that slant on things i i did with my agent that sold the book uh he's no longer with rcm and um so i saved it by amanda urban so that was very flattering and and uh i wasn't i wasn't in a position

17:59.305 --> 18:02.188
I was in the middle of my contract.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.871
I couldn't go with Gordon, and he didn't know what he was doing.

18:06.592 --> 18:14.159
So it really wasn't a good time for me to sort of... She was getting to become an agent.

18:14.299 --> 18:14.399
Yeah.

18:14.419 --> 18:15.240
She's an actor.

18:15.821 --> 18:16.501
She really is.

18:16.802 --> 18:24.609
The hardest thing, let me tell you, I've been around with you for 20 years.

18:26.411 --> 18:26.511
Yeah.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.044
How do you think to get an agent?

18:32.124 --> 18:35.288
How do you think to get an agent to get a publisher?

18:35.508 --> 18:38.512
I mean, it only makes sense.

18:38.532 --> 18:41.836
Yeah, it does.

18:41.856 --> 18:49.765
You know, you're going to take $6,000 to get it, $15,000, $25,000, and what do you think?

18:54.217 --> 18:58.827
So I would have a focus behind it, and you would have a focus behind it.

19:21.790 --> 19:26.538
I was in such a rush.

19:27.058 --> 19:29.242
This is in 1994.

19:30.083 --> 19:36.473
So did you have to do more work on it?

19:36.493 --> 19:48.793
She bought it and we had some suggestions about... I think I have already started creating a lot more fine music.

19:50.832 --> 20:01.645
Spotlight?

20:01.665 --> 20:11.978
A couple of things that I think I'm like, so spotlight is not a good spotlight.

20:11.998 --> 20:12.619
Yeah, it's not a spotlight.

20:16.604 --> 20:16.965
Is that spotlight?

20:16.985 --> 20:17.345
Is that spotlight?

20:17.365 --> 20:17.886
It's all it's easy to say.

20:17.906 --> 20:18.947
I feel like this has always been small in the world.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.569
And when you talk about the elements, you know, what you know it's very special.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.555
Thank you.

21:50.408 --> 22:19.707
So, um,

22:20.581 --> 22:31.945
He was great on the page.

22:32.607 --> 22:41.205
He knew what I was trying to get at and he could show me ways to go about it.

22:41.573 --> 22:42.134
Wad?

22:42.975 --> 22:43.195
No.

22:44.697 --> 22:50.784
At home, up until the day I finished the book, Mom was still telling me that I could be a nurse.

22:52.386 --> 22:54.529
Nurses always get chops, actually.

22:55.970 --> 22:58.754
Terrible.

22:58.774 --> 22:59.094
Was she serious?

22:59.114 --> 23:00.235
Did she want you to be a nurse?

23:00.255 --> 23:00.916
She's teasing.

23:01.217 --> 23:04.981
She's teasing, but the whole English major track was never encouraged.

23:05.001 --> 23:09.066
The first day I knew it meant anything.

23:09.940 --> 23:15.648
I loved that idea.

23:15.668 --> 23:16.389
I went to a liberal arts school.

23:16.409 --> 23:19.774
It was the day I was appointed to this book editor's job.

23:19.915 --> 23:25.242
I was 38, and at that point, I said, finally, my name is made your means off.

23:25.262 --> 23:26.705
Fade off, yeah.

23:26.965 --> 23:28.127
I know what you mean.

23:28.187 --> 23:31.471
That was the dream job, to get a new book on the world.

23:31.592 --> 23:33.094
I can imagine.

23:33.114 --> 23:34.215
I think, yeah.

23:34.536 --> 23:36.960
Even though I don't want to make a statement.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.682
I think about it.

23:39.691 --> 23:45.059
I just figured it with someone.

23:45.079 --> 23:45.500
I love my own person.

23:45.520 --> 23:45.881
Yes.

23:46.081 --> 23:47.383
A lot of work.

23:50.608 --> 23:52.751
Do you think it's all emerging?

23:52.771 --> 23:55.796
I believe you read it.

23:55.816 --> 23:56.397
Let's see.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.101
I think that's the first time you did it also.

23:59.121 --> 23:59.342
Oh, really?

23:59.362 --> 24:01.285
Yes, I've never read it.

24:02.547 --> 24:06.733
That year, I really loved that book.

24:06.753 --> 24:07.234
There's nobody worth it.

24:08.210 --> 24:11.588
And more later.

24:35.733 --> 24:56.607
I don't know how I sit in my room.

24:56.627 --> 24:57.488
I don't need a whole lot of time, actually.

24:58.075 --> 25:24.972
And so it's been a while, but I've read it, but some things where I grew up, like that makes me feel like I've had to do that.

25:24.992 --> 25:25.753
I have a story, I was, you know, like,

25:31.252 --> 25:48.147
No, I'm going to excuse it for that.

25:49.898 --> 26:02.989
Yeah, I'm gay, because I don't know.

26:03.009 --> 26:03.270
I don't know.

26:03.290 --> 26:03.550
I'm so sorry.

26:03.570 --> 26:03.871
So I was there.

26:03.891 --> 26:05.395
Well, in terms of the book, in terms of the EWQ-ray podcast, I didn't know.

26:05.415 --> 26:05.595
Yep, yep.

26:06.503 --> 26:32.765
Shri Mataji?

26:32.785 --> 26:32.865
Yes.

26:35.478 --> 27:01.452
How about that?

27:04.739 --> 27:11.560
Yeah.

28:16.306 --> 28:16.968
.

30:31.677 --> 30:32.272
you

34:25.160 --> 34:26.058
you

39:23.510 --> 39:25.268
And I hop around.

40:46.973 --> 41:08.887
I don't know.

41:08.907 --> 41:09.768
I don't feel like you've made me very well.

41:09.788 --> 41:10.008
I have not.

41:10.028 --> 41:11.270
Because I have art, and I don't know about this kind of thing.

41:11.290 --> 41:11.771
I'm not out of the boat.

41:11.791 --> 41:12.272
I'm not out of the boat.

41:12.292 --> 41:12.772
I'm not out of the boat.

41:12.793 --> 41:13.273
I'm not out of the boat.

41:13.293 --> 41:13.774
I'm not out of the boat.

41:31.962 --> 41:57.674
Really?

41:57.694 --> 41:57.795
Yeah.

41:57.815 --> 41:57.915
Yeah.

41:57.935 --> 41:58.035
Yeah.

41:58.055 --> 41:58.155
Yeah.

41:58.625 --> 42:26.021
Oh, nice.

42:26.041 --> 42:26.321
Let her do it.

42:26.341 --> 42:26.421
Yes.

42:29.776 --> 42:59.312
Yes.

42:59.332 --> 42:59.412
Yes.

42:59.965 --> 43:06.974
Yes, sir.

43:28.083 --> 43:28.183
Yeah.

43:39.402 --> 44:06.777
You know, I don't think so much of it is hard to get around that.

44:11.296 --> 44:29.805
So, I thought I had a lovely time because of that, and I didn't know what to do.

44:29.825 --> 44:30.085
That's a lot.

44:30.105 --> 44:30.786
You know, I don't know what to do.

44:30.807 --> 44:31.468
But I decided to know what to do.

44:31.488 --> 44:31.768
So, that was .

44:37.655 --> 45:04.050
Well, I think I don't know this stuff, so I'm not like

45:06.477 --> 45:33.282
Well, like I said, that person was in public, and I just got tired of everything, looking at my skills.

45:33.302 --> 45:33.582
So, with that,

45:33.865 --> 46:00.732
Yeah.

46:00.752 --> 46:00.852
Yeah.

46:08.324 --> 46:12.495
Thank you.
