00:02.984 --> 00:12.198
We're talking to Ann Michaels, and these are all notes on the book.

00:13.179 --> 00:16.845
I hope we use some of them.

00:16.865 --> 00:19.549
Let's enter the discussion.

00:19.569 --> 00:31.827
Maybe the way you've entered this book, how often is it that a poet does go... I mean, you can ask these questions, I know, but let's start there.

00:32.650 --> 00:35.774
17 years ago, I guess you had the idea of 1980.

00:35.895 --> 00:42.965
Is that what somebody... About 12 years ago that I started thinking about this book.

00:44.587 --> 00:44.727
Yeah.

00:44.847 --> 00:49.674
Oh, actually, no, that's true.

00:49.714 --> 00:51.637
1980 was the first germ of the idea.

00:51.657 --> 00:52.678
But the impulse, I guess.

00:52.758 --> 00:55.542
Yeah, no, that's true.

00:56.123 --> 01:02.472
It was spinning me for a long time before I actually sat down to work on it.

01:03.835 --> 01:05.717
And the impulse was narrative?

01:05.837 --> 01:06.778
It was fiction?

01:06.798 --> 01:07.659
It was prose?

01:07.679 --> 01:09.161
Is that right?

01:10.903 --> 01:15.408
Well, the characters came to me very physically, very physically.

01:15.428 --> 01:21.975
I had the beginning of the book, the end of the book, the end of the first part of the book, right from the start.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.484
It wasn't my intention to write a novel for the sake of writing a novel.

01:31.139 --> 01:44.316
But I realized that this material, for several reasons, would have to be told as a novel.

01:44.657 --> 01:59.897
One reason is that I wanted to keep the reader company, accompany the reader through these journeys of both characters in a way that you can't do in poetry.

02:00.518 --> 02:03.221
And it did have to be two characters.

02:03.241 --> 02:04.542
Yes, definitely.

02:04.562 --> 02:09.767
I mean, this seems to be where you're having trouble with your critics, by the way, the reviewers.

02:09.787 --> 02:11.789
I'm sure you noticed they love your book.

02:12.290 --> 02:16.454
Did you see Gail Caldwell's movie book on the Boston Globe?

02:16.834 --> 02:18.556
I really hope that you must get it.

02:18.576 --> 02:20.478
Yes, I haven't seen it yet.

02:20.498 --> 02:22.159
I mean, it's magnificent.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.825
And I have the greatest respect for Gail, I know, Gail.

02:28.126 --> 02:33.313
asymmetrical form of the book with the two stories, absolutely crucial.

02:34.074 --> 02:56.226
And the reviewers who have understood this have been, you know, there have been dissenters, yes, but there have been a lot of reviewers who have understood exactly what it's about, the form, and which, you know, for which I'm very grateful, because it was very...

02:56.594 --> 03:01.820
carefully, very carefully, fall out.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.424
I'm interested in this concept you can give us at the very first page.

03:05.584 --> 03:11.571
Of course, I think of buried manuscripts and hidden manuscripts and notebooks.

03:11.591 --> 03:15.055
This is the theme of my new book.

03:15.356 --> 03:20.682
I'm really interested in the records that we keep to ourselves.

03:20.802 --> 03:24.306
At the British Library two weeks ago, one of their great finds there,

03:25.265 --> 03:32.455
from this Chinese cave, these manuscripts that they found going back a thousand years ago, 2000 years.

03:32.575 --> 03:43.589
I love these, the Cairo Genesia, which is very, it's like garbage almost, but they're written things that really give a view of themselves.

03:44.030 --> 03:49.157
Now, you're using this certainly as an image, but it's got to be more than that.

03:49.197 --> 03:53.162
What is the premise for this whole

03:53.969 --> 04:02.798
idea of these notebooks that he's searching for, that kind of significance, I guess.

04:02.818 --> 04:03.559
A written record.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.302
I'd enter it anywhere.

04:06.963 --> 04:16.793
Maybe it's not a question, it's just a... I'm... I also am fascinated by the whole idea of manuscripts that we know were written but had never been found.

04:18.655 --> 04:22.980
These kinds of fugitive pieces that we know that

04:23.787 --> 04:37.447
so-and-so wrote a lost novel that she'd never found, or, you know, this idea of this sort of ghost realm of the ghost library.

04:37.467 --> 04:42.374
You're talking about things that are really heating up right now.

04:42.394 --> 04:43.656
I just love that idea.

04:43.676 --> 04:47.782
There was a fugitive press, you know, in England during the... Really?

04:47.802 --> 04:49.084
It was called the Fugitive Press.

04:49.104 --> 04:53.170
They were on a run, and they were during the interregnary.

04:53.791 --> 05:05.097
I write about it in my book, in The Gentle Madness, about this fellow who actually hid stuff and was going to send it to Holland, and he hid them at a table, a hollow table, and he was going to bury them on the ground.

05:05.518 --> 05:11.412
And it now turns out to be the greatest, most significant record of that period, both sides of the issue.

05:12.033 --> 05:19.582
you know, during that period in England, but what he collected were the outprints of the fugitive, what was known as the fugitive press.

05:19.602 --> 05:21.965
So, I mean... Fabulous.

05:22.325 --> 05:23.787
Anyway, I'm sorry.

05:23.807 --> 05:25.129
I didn't know, but that's fabulous.

05:25.149 --> 05:25.789
No, that's fabulous.

05:25.849 --> 05:34.560
Yeah, but these weren't pieces that were hidden and forgotten, you know, so there is slightly different memory, but artifacts of itself.

05:34.720 --> 05:34.980
Yes.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.846
It has to be more than something that we pass on orally, I guess.

05:40.265 --> 05:44.932
Well, it's very poignant to me that people kept records during the war.

05:44.992 --> 05:47.276
They wrote things down.

05:47.336 --> 05:49.339
They witnessed things.

05:52.104 --> 05:53.586
The stories had to be told.

05:53.646 --> 05:59.455
They felt the moral imperative to tell those stories.

05:59.553 --> 06:25.577
literally literally buried them um hoping that they'd be found eventually is there evidence of this or is there something oh no absolutely absolutely um things hidden under floors floorboards and the great example of the one that survived yes how that has resonated that is

06:27.262 --> 06:31.969
undoubtedly one of the most moving documents to come out of that horror, isn't it?

06:31.989 --> 06:35.434
It's a little girl's diary, when you think about it.

06:35.454 --> 06:39.300
It could very easily have gone into the record's vault, I guess.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.221
That's right.

06:41.343 --> 06:51.919
The idea that one would write it down, not knowing if it would ever, hoping that, like, you know,

06:52.625 --> 06:57.670
the letter in the bottle that the shipwrecked person said don't have the disease.

06:58.251 --> 06:58.511
Yeah.

06:59.552 --> 07:06.920
Because there's a great faith in that, buried in that idea.

07:06.940 --> 07:15.369
And a sense of morality that's beyond the here and now.

07:15.710 --> 07:22.497
I mean, that these stories must be told, even if it takes a thousand years for them to be found.

07:22.747 --> 07:31.475
I have a sense that everything has a meaning for you, and it's so significant that this person is a translator, for instance.

07:31.495 --> 07:34.438
Yes, absolutely.

07:34.458 --> 07:37.540
Every time I run into something, she's telling me something.

07:38.922 --> 07:42.245
Language, communication, memory, documents.

07:44.687 --> 07:48.831
The physical reality as opposed to, I mean, detail is very important.

07:48.851 --> 07:52.534
The physical... Utterly.

07:53.881 --> 08:03.938
Again, I'm not trying to review the book with you, but again, I'm looking for the things that go into it.

08:03.958 --> 08:08.866
These are the toughest things to do, by the way, with novelists, because it is a creative thing.

08:09.848 --> 08:18.302
I feel kind of dumb asking you what you were trying to accomplish, but it's my job to do that.

08:18.890 --> 08:23.195
but we are looking for a future here.

08:23.576 --> 08:30.424
Just go ahead and talk about the pull of the past, I feel.

08:30.885 --> 08:47.265
Were you moved to write about the Holocaust as an event, or as a human exploration for you, or an infinite exploration?

08:47.285 --> 08:48.306
I was haunted by

08:48.590 --> 08:54.276
certain split-seconds of history which seemed completely impenetrable.

08:56.399 --> 09:08.012
I think it is impossible to understand a huge historic event.

09:09.814 --> 09:17.483
You can't embrace the whole and hope for any understanding, but if you perhaps enter through tiny

09:19.150 --> 09:33.085
take a tiny root into it, then hopefully that will open up into a larger meaning.

09:33.365 --> 09:47.841
And so, for me, there were clusters of events, clusters, moments, that I really wanted to try and penetrate for myself as a human being.

09:49.103 --> 09:57.215
It seems to me that the question is more interesting to you than the answer.

09:57.235 --> 10:00.660
Is that a fair statement?

10:00.680 --> 10:07.930
Well, I don't think that a novel is a good place to give answers.

10:07.950 --> 10:11.035
I think it's a good place to pose questions.

10:12.136 --> 10:18.165
But the questions that you pose must be precise and

10:18.685 --> 10:20.908
specific.

10:21.008 --> 10:23.731
And finding the right question is often very difficult.

10:26.595 --> 10:36.007
Are they questions that you feel comfortable with, that you have not be the answer, that some comprehension of what the answer could be?

10:37.329 --> 10:47.562
Well, certainly when I started writing this, I had no idea that I would be able to come through the other side.

10:48.925 --> 11:01.868
But I followed the characters, and they led me, definitely led me.

11:02.510 --> 11:05.275
The characters did?

11:05.295 --> 11:05.435
Mm-hmm.

11:05.455 --> 11:12.688
And they were male characters, and that did intimidate you at all?

11:14.626 --> 11:20.476
I didn't even think about it, because they came to me so vividly.

11:20.876 --> 11:22.359
Can you see them visually?

11:22.379 --> 11:23.641
Yes, I can see them visually.

11:23.901 --> 11:25.404
Do you hear their voices?

11:26.967 --> 11:32.295
Yes, and they just were men.

11:32.536 --> 11:39.267
And the boy digging his

11:40.090 --> 11:44.215
digging his bed every night into mud to save himself.

11:44.275 --> 11:48.661
This is a very poignant image to me.

11:50.043 --> 12:05.822
So, you know, I'd love to say there's some kind of politicized reason for choosing two male narrators, but in fact, that's just the way it came to me.

12:05.842 --> 12:07.144
That's right.

12:09.419 --> 12:17.587
And I've read in some of the interviews that you've done that I guess you did this in longhand, but you do some things in typewriter and you do some things in computer.

12:17.607 --> 12:18.328
Is that right?

12:19.789 --> 12:24.474
I mostly write longhand and put it into the computer now.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.956
The typewriter is gathering dust in the corner.

12:27.196 --> 12:32.421
Do you find that you can create stuff on the computer, or is it just more of a convenience thing?

12:32.442 --> 12:33.062
Yeah.

12:33.082 --> 12:39.088
It's just, once I've written it, I put it in and then move it around.

12:39.220 --> 12:48.432
The celebration is... Yeah, it's always pen to paper for me.

12:48.892 --> 12:57.844
Now, as a poet with two highly respected volumes of poetry, the words are so important to me, the word.

13:00.327 --> 13:06.915
Did you find yourself feeling the same way and writing complements?

13:07.402 --> 13:10.445
I think that's one of the reasons why it may have taken ten years to do.

13:12.607 --> 13:27.763
I was, one of the reasons, another reason I was reluctant to start the novel is that I felt I was, I worried that I'd have to surrender a certain intensity of language, which I didn't really want to do.

13:30.205 --> 13:35.130
But once I, once I just let

13:36.241 --> 13:41.228
let myself write it the way I felt it needed to be written, then it was very liberating.

13:41.268 --> 13:47.697
And the language itself, it's so important thematically.

13:50.661 --> 13:52.584
It's redemptive.

13:52.845 --> 13:57.171
It's powerful for the characters.

13:57.191 --> 14:05.202
There's all kinds of discussion about the power of a single letter, the graffiti on the

14:06.430 --> 14:34.429
on the walls in Athens, the resistance, the J stamped on a passport, goes the power of a single letter, also the notion that Jacob chooses English or finds in English an alphabet without memory, which gives him a chance to

14:36.586 --> 14:43.855
really, for the first time, think and write about trauma.

14:45.297 --> 14:49.242
Pursue that alphabet without memory.

14:50.223 --> 15:05.682
Well, for him, he needs to speak of the things that are most painful, but he needs that little

15:06.151 --> 15:21.856
that sense of a tiny gap of distance which English provides, because it's not the language in which these things occurred.

15:26.102 --> 15:29.147
Well, does the translator, in a sense, make the work his own?

15:30.670 --> 15:32.833
Oh, absolutely.

15:33.134 --> 15:34.355
Is this your odyssey?

15:34.435 --> 15:36.478
Is this Homer's odyssey?"

15:36.498 --> 15:37.279
And what did he say?

15:37.679 --> 15:42.364
And he said, every generation deserves a Homer of their own.

15:42.404 --> 15:44.847
You deserve a Dante and you deserve a Shakespeare.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.369
And he said, you know, I stretch the idiom.

15:46.729 --> 15:51.294
I stretch Homer's idiom and I stretch mine.

15:51.795 --> 16:01.065
I was just in Germany and someone was telling the story of how, I can't remember the writer now, I can't remember who it was,

16:02.547 --> 16:08.295
It was in Norway or Sweden, and everyone there speaks impeccable English.

16:09.617 --> 16:10.859
His book had just been translated.

16:10.879 --> 16:12.782
My book sold well over there.

16:12.802 --> 16:13.222
Oh, that's good.

16:13.282 --> 16:13.983
That's good.

16:14.003 --> 16:14.804
They all read it in English.

16:15.245 --> 16:26.221
Well, he gave this reading, and it was half in Swedish and half in English, and afterwards, you know, he said, well, why did they translate this?

16:26.281 --> 16:30.647
Everybody can read it in English, and perfectly.

16:30.863 --> 16:37.895
And the publisher said, because we need to claim the book as our own.

16:38.777 --> 16:45.208
So by putting it into their language, they were somehow claiming the book.

16:45.228 --> 16:51.278
That's the phrase they used, embracing the book, which I thought was a lovely idea, actually.

16:51.298 --> 16:55.926
In my book, I talk about this young man, which is kind of like

16:56.632 --> 17:05.383
Johnny Applesey was desperate to save the Yiddish language by saving the books, which would be succeeding generations.

17:05.403 --> 17:10.549
Nobody speaks Yiddish anymore, and so therefore they were throwing the books away.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.590
It's a fascinating story.

17:11.630 --> 17:15.675
He went out and gathered a million books in Yiddish.

17:15.695 --> 17:16.216
Oh, yes.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.117
It's a big library.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.400
Well, it's not more than a library.

17:19.420 --> 17:21.543
It's a warehouse out there.

17:21.563 --> 17:21.863
Where is it?

17:22.180 --> 17:23.742
It's out in Western Massachusetts.

17:23.782 --> 17:30.812
And then he does seed libraries all over the world with these books and hope that the language will raise.

17:30.832 --> 17:33.035
But it's kind of similar to what you're saying.

17:33.155 --> 17:35.198
That's very beautiful, actually.

17:35.278 --> 17:42.308
That's one of my very favorite parts of the book.

17:42.468 --> 17:47.715
When you're talking about making it yours, you see, that's

17:48.337 --> 17:51.810
But that's really a theme of the book, isn't it?

17:51.830 --> 17:56.226
I mean, if it's lost, it's lost, isn't it?

17:56.728 --> 17:59.578
Anything is lost, I guess.

17:59.677 --> 18:06.385
Yeah, well, I think for, certainly for Jacob, there's a sense that there's no absence.

18:06.405 --> 18:10.190
I think he says there's no absence if there's even a memory of absence.

18:10.711 --> 18:13.294
I mean, of course, the ironies are there.

18:13.314 --> 18:17.139
We have a kid coming out, and it's almost, of course, the appearance of a feral child.

18:18.140 --> 18:22.766
In Greece, of course, Athos is where the gods lived.

18:23.467 --> 18:26.370
And you're talking about calling from one total extreme to the other.

18:26.791 --> 18:27.912
I'm sure these were mindful.

18:29.056 --> 18:31.059
things on your part, I would think.

18:31.499 --> 18:32.401
Oh, absolutely.

18:32.501 --> 18:39.190
And the guy who survives the speakable circumstances of the Holocaust, you get killed by a car.

18:39.370 --> 18:45.318
I mean, you talk about dumb luck, you know.

18:45.338 --> 18:54.771
I mean, are we shooting craps with the gods here, or is it a little bit, it's a phrase, playing dice, gambling, shooting craps here?

18:55.091 --> 18:56.413
Absolutely, I am.

18:56.815 --> 18:59.358
I've seen guys and dolls.

18:59.378 --> 19:14.858
This kind of arbitrariness of life, I mean, that's just, that's realistic.

19:15.059 --> 19:19.845
And in fact, I mean, the point of that is partly reinforced by what Abbas says.

19:19.945 --> 19:20.646
He says,

19:22.077 --> 19:29.303
You know, we think that it's the small things that we can control, and not the large, but in fact it's the other way around.

19:29.784 --> 19:42.095
It's the large human values that we have to, the values large enough to see that we have to enforce, because the small detail will elude us always.

19:43.596 --> 19:51.443
We can't predict, you know, the car accident, the falling brick, the

19:52.553 --> 20:00.985
But the large human values, those are the things that we have to preserve.

20:01.245 --> 20:04.731
You know how you're jumping ahead to questions sometimes.

20:05.532 --> 20:09.037
Go ahead.

20:09.097 --> 20:11.300
It'll come to me.

20:11.320 --> 20:17.509
Anyhow, that arbitrariness is very deliberate.

20:17.529 --> 20:22.476
Give me a second.

20:23.097 --> 20:31.646
There was one thing you said in one of your interviews, this isn't it, but was it in fact against the law in Nazi Germany to refer to Jews as human beings?

20:31.666 --> 20:32.046
Oh, absolutely.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.347
I mean, was this codified?

20:33.387 --> 20:34.469
Yes, absolutely.

20:34.569 --> 20:35.329
It was illegal.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.194
You found evidence of that.

20:40.214 --> 20:47.822
Because, of course, in this country it was illegal to teach people to read.

20:48.528 --> 20:55.499
that that is even a deeper level of people in this reality, to say that they aren't even humans, you know.

20:56.941 --> 20:59.144
I've never heard of that before.

20:59.204 --> 21:17.252
This is very crucial to the whole, I mean the whole, all the detail, all the scientific detail, all the geology, everything in the book is tied to this one point, because if you say that man, if you reduce man to matter,

21:17.789 --> 21:21.012
the human being.

21:22.373 --> 21:24.455
I guess you'll take the gender out of it.

21:24.515 --> 21:27.037
Yeah, that's fine.

21:27.057 --> 21:37.105
Then, in order to rebuild the human, you have to start from where it's been reduced to, matter.

21:38.527 --> 21:47.374
And this whole sense of, which is the core of his faith, when he finally reaches that point of believing that faith is

21:47.827 --> 21:56.378
anatomical, since his whole... he ascends from that point of the book on.

21:59.642 --> 22:13.159
But all the science as well is sort of reinforcing this idea on the miraculous

22:13.460 --> 22:18.148
Because this isn't a reductive philosophy, it's miraculous.

22:19.190 --> 22:28.366
And so the miracles of earth science, of weather, of all these things are miraculous matter.

22:29.107 --> 22:35.097
You were born, I guess, in 1958?

22:35.117 --> 22:35.218
Wow.

22:35.238 --> 22:38.944
A full decade, and then some after the year.

22:39.430 --> 22:47.938
How does it resonate with you?

22:50.540 --> 22:57.186
When I was growing up, all the stories from the war were coming out.

22:57.206 --> 22:58.828
The photographs were coming out.

22:59.428 --> 23:02.291
It was all around.

23:03.051 --> 23:07.075
You have no memory of it, so it is coming to you, isn't it?

23:07.679 --> 23:10.127
secondary sources, so to speak.

23:11.130 --> 23:14.661
I wonder if it would have been different had you lived through it.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.186
I don't think I'm related to myself.

23:16.206 --> 23:19.697
I was born at 43 when I came right there.

23:20.369 --> 23:23.093
See, this is also the point.

23:23.233 --> 23:28.921
That's who we're calling.

23:32.005 --> 23:34.849
I'll see it be obvious, right?

23:34.869 --> 23:37.313
But you'll have it coming out of my mouth.

23:37.693 --> 23:49.650
It's very important to me that... It's very important that both characters are

23:49.934 --> 23:55.262
profoundly, utterly shaped by events that they don't experience themselves.

23:56.263 --> 23:57.084
What does this mean?

23:57.284 --> 24:05.176
What are these invisible links between history and biography, between the past and the present?

24:05.196 --> 24:08.600
I mean, Jacob's in hiding.

24:09.462 --> 24:11.605
Events happen around him.

24:11.665 --> 24:15.550
He doesn't know about them until afterwards.

24:15.831 --> 24:18.895
So he's separated by space.

24:19.162 --> 24:20.023
geographically.

24:23.228 --> 24:29.017
But Ben, of course, separated through time, from the events through time.

24:29.999 --> 24:36.950
And it's very, very crucial.

24:38.753 --> 24:42.799
What are these links to the past?

24:43.821 --> 24:46.705
What constitutes them?

24:49.199 --> 25:16.033
And another point here, too, is that when the... that maybe the moral imperative is sort of shifting now, because whereas one could say how one can't write about these things because one did not experience them,

25:17.212 --> 25:26.447
I think that that's changing now, that one must write about them because one hasn't, precisely because one hasn't experienced them.

25:26.467 --> 25:33.558
And when the participants are gone, the questions are not going to die with them.

25:33.578 --> 25:34.740
The questions remain.

25:34.820 --> 25:39.568
They may become more enigmatic as a matter of time.

25:39.588 --> 25:40.429
Maybe not, maybe not.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.072
And we will...

25:42.980 --> 25:45.264
I mean, wouldn't I love to ask Shakespeare questions?

25:45.284 --> 25:48.369
Give me one hour.

25:48.930 --> 25:52.416
I've asked this question to scholars.

25:52.657 --> 25:59.268
If I gave you one hour from Shakespeare, what would you ask?

25:59.288 --> 26:03.896
I asked this to Harold Bloom.

26:04.758 --> 26:05.359
He said, oh, give me.

26:05.828 --> 26:07.210
Let me think about this.

26:07.310 --> 26:08.011
Yeah, that's right.

26:08.051 --> 26:10.955
That's one interview you'd really have to prepare for.

26:10.975 --> 26:11.936
But I said, well, I've got an hour.

26:12.016 --> 26:16.583
Well, I'm going to give you an hour, the appointment, so really be very careful with your help.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.504
Absolutely.

26:17.744 --> 26:23.031
But you see, I mean, things that would have been so simple to answer while he was alive, you know.

26:24.113 --> 26:28.579
I guess it's related to, you know, people die, but the questions linger.

26:29.302 --> 26:38.230
It's almost harder to answer them as opposed to during the heat of the moment, so to speak.

26:38.290 --> 26:43.374
See, I'm trained as a journalist, and I love to do interviews with people, and if I don't know something, I'll ask.

26:43.954 --> 26:46.537
What's the recipe for this brownie?

26:46.557 --> 26:47.377
How did you do this?

26:48.018 --> 26:54.063
There's a very stupid analogy, but you know what I'm saying?

26:54.083 --> 26:54.323
No.

26:54.784 --> 26:55.464
Yeah, no, no.

26:55.484 --> 26:56.645
Are we going crazy here?

26:56.785 --> 26:57.606
No, no, no.

26:57.746 --> 26:58.667
I don't mind.

26:59.423 --> 27:23.553
But I think the questions are hard to answer at the time as well, because it's very hard to separate, you know, one's own involvement.

27:23.593 --> 27:23.693
Okay.

27:24.382 --> 27:30.250
Chris, I haven't read your poems, but I don't know.

27:30.310 --> 27:36.940
Is there narrative in them?

27:36.980 --> 27:38.181
There is narrative in them.

27:38.502 --> 27:42.888
It's either a discrete narrative or quite an overt narrative.

27:44.871 --> 27:53.443
And often, I've done a lot of work speaking through the voices of various

27:53.930 --> 28:03.181
characters, only real historical figures, like Johannes Kepler, the mathematician of the 1600s.

28:05.684 --> 28:19.381
So putting myself audaciously into Kepler's person, I mean, that kind of challenge to me is completely fantastic.

28:19.401 --> 28:23.346
I mean, I just... Poetry and mathematics is really something.

28:23.748 --> 28:27.631
But there must be poetry in the universe, I guess, and everything.

28:27.651 --> 28:45.847
And he... What also fascinates me about him, which is also part of this book, is that there's a tremendous emotional... Ideas have a tremendous emotional quality.

28:47.028 --> 28:49.230
That ideas and emotions are not separate.

28:50.351 --> 28:52.573
And, um...

28:52.891 --> 29:12.368
I think that one of the most powerful ideas have an emotional quality to them.

29:13.141 --> 29:16.725
Making the transition from poetry, usually it's the other way around.

29:16.765 --> 29:21.211
I mean, every novelist you talk to aspires to be a poet.

29:21.231 --> 29:25.777
John Updike did nothing more than to be remembered as a poet.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.699
Of course poetry, you know.

29:27.719 --> 29:28.840
I mean, it's just a fact.

29:29.241 --> 29:32.285
Everybody writes it, he knows how it works.

29:32.305 --> 29:42.237
You know, any writer that you talk to that I've talked to hundreds, you know, maybe the ultimate achievement, I guess, creative achievement to beautiful poetry.

29:42.892 --> 29:54.363
Do you feel, I'm curious as to the, you know, very rarely do you see a poet's step back, or maybe it's a parallel move in your future to do a novel?

29:54.383 --> 29:58.567
I mean, is it a...?

29:58.587 --> 30:00.910
Well, I mean... I'm asking the question delicately, I guess.

30:00.990 --> 30:01.630
Yeah.

30:01.730 --> 30:11.700
Each form has its own incredible challenges and tyrannies to

30:15.865 --> 30:42.885
To write a literary novel is not, I would say, not any easier or harder than writing a poem, but poetry is

30:44.131 --> 30:46.935
is demanding in completely different ways.

30:48.297 --> 30:50.220
Do you find yourself going back from one to the other?

30:50.300 --> 30:56.850
I think at least one of the collections came out while this work was in progress, is that right?

30:56.930 --> 31:03.260
Yes, I've also written another book of pillow trees while I was working on, which hasn't been published yet.

31:03.280 --> 31:09.229
Do you switch from one to the other with ease?

31:09.549 --> 31:11.893
Well, I found that with this novel,

31:12.785 --> 31:22.578
Some of it was so hard to write, so painful, that I kept pausing.

31:23.399 --> 31:29.408
And I also really wanted to try and get as close to getting this right as possible.

31:29.788 --> 31:30.950
There's no second chance.

31:32.592 --> 31:39.581
You can't enter into this material lightly, and there's no second chance to get it right.

31:39.762 --> 31:42.285
So you feel that the finished book is a finished book?

31:43.278 --> 31:45.520
That's a totally different question.

31:45.680 --> 31:52.968
That's a different question, and I know that.

31:53.088 --> 31:53.208
Yeah.

31:53.228 --> 32:03.959
So, I would put it aside, just to wait, and write poetry.

32:05.421 --> 32:12.728
So, switching back and forth is, I mean,

32:14.935 --> 32:26.555
I think that's a delicate thing to balance, and when you're really in the heat of writing one or the other, you can't—I can't—jump back and forth.

32:27.036 --> 32:27.877
Now, what was that other—?

32:28.599 --> 32:39.137
Well, the other question was just vaguely related, but I guess it anticipates this whole trend towards interacting with books, books in print and on paper.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.547
It was a book, a finished book.

32:41.627 --> 32:47.194
Yeah, but I mean, there are authors, very few, thank goodness, who will go back if the new edition is coming out.

32:47.755 --> 32:52.281
Tim O'Brien is doing it, going after Cacciato, he's actually changing parts of that.

32:52.301 --> 33:00.071
He told me, of course, then he had, he had, in fact, he got a letter from a teacher who was reading from the high cover and the students were reading the paper.

33:00.091 --> 33:02.374
I said, wait a minute, there are differences here.

33:02.573 --> 33:04.337
And I said, why?

33:04.438 --> 33:07.144
He said, I have an obligation to make it as perfect as I can.

33:07.164 --> 33:09.711
I said, Tim, that was you 20 years ago.

33:10.212 --> 33:11.816
That's fine.

33:11.876 --> 33:14.062
That's you, a different you.

33:14.082 --> 33:16.528
I mean, do you agree with that?

33:16.548 --> 33:19.435
It reminds me of a very good story, actually.

33:20.798 --> 33:26.386
It's a totally different question, but I'm just curious to see it.

33:26.466 --> 33:29.230
Well, John Fowles did that with the Magus.

33:29.270 --> 33:30.993
I mean, that's one of the most famous examples.

33:31.013 --> 33:32.715
Henry James did it with everything.

33:32.795 --> 33:35.099
He went back to the New York edition.

33:35.119 --> 33:36.881
He's not supposed to be writing prefaces anyway.

33:36.901 --> 33:40.006
I mean, fools around with all the novels.

33:40.086 --> 33:40.687
Is that right?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.069
Fowles did it with the Magus?

33:42.089 --> 33:42.549
I didn't know that.

33:42.590 --> 33:47.076
Yes, he put out a whole new edition, a revised edition.

33:47.596 --> 33:50.400
I mean, did he change it thematically, substantially?

33:50.560 --> 33:52.022
I only read the revised edition.

33:52.042 --> 33:58.191
I never read the original, so I don't know, but I think some of it is quite different.

33:58.211 --> 34:13.232
But I had this wonderful experience of seeing Stephen Spender read, and his Oxford had put out his collective poems in massive telephone book-sized collection.

34:13.769 --> 34:14.370
wonderful.

34:15.693 --> 34:19.903
And he got up on stage and he started to read and he wanted to read chronologically.

34:22.008 --> 34:26.498
So he was looking at poems written literally 35 years before.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.930
And as he was reading, he took his pencil out.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.004
It was changing words as he was reading.

34:35.024 --> 34:40.332
And it was sort of like a collective gasp of horror from every writer in the audience.

34:40.352 --> 34:43.416
He just thought, you know, 35 years, my God.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.900
I did an interview with Stanley Kunitz last year.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.464
I just prefer one of the National Book Awards.

34:49.365 --> 34:53.471
And I asked him, as I asked you to describe the book, I said, give it to me.

34:53.491 --> 34:54.613
And he made a change.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.758
And then he said, well, he made a change in one of the poems.

34:58.459 --> 34:59.620
This is the way it should be.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.343
He said, isn't that amazing?

35:01.610 --> 35:02.871
I said, thank you.

35:02.891 --> 35:04.433
That makes sense.

35:06.194 --> 35:07.976
First edition.

35:08.116 --> 35:22.550
In one of the interviews you mentioned, a reading for you has been, what was the phrase that Jesus is?

35:23.271 --> 35:29.036
There was a lot at stake, I guess you said, in the reader book.

35:29.096 --> 35:30.958
And then this interview

35:31.833 --> 35:37.101
I appreciate it asking you about what's at stake in writing the book.

35:37.121 --> 35:44.252
We all know that, but I'm curious, what's at stake in reading the book?

35:44.272 --> 35:46.875
Because you did say readers and letters.

35:46.895 --> 35:57.992
Well, one would like to...one would hope that, I guess, the ideal reader

35:59.440 --> 36:02.443
reads in order to be changed by what they read.

36:04.764 --> 36:05.965
They want to be changed.

36:06.466 --> 36:06.946
Do you think so?

36:06.966 --> 36:07.707
By what they read.

36:07.747 --> 36:09.428
The ideal reader?

36:09.448 --> 36:09.989
The ideal.

36:10.389 --> 36:10.990
The ideal.

36:11.790 --> 36:13.712
Very important qualification.

36:13.732 --> 36:14.733
Well, absolutely.

36:14.773 --> 36:25.142
It's like Kafka's wonderful saying about, you know, a book must be the axe that breaks the frozen sea within us.

36:26.383 --> 36:29.245
I mean, that's asking an awful lot of a book, for sure.

36:29.950 --> 36:33.959
And it's asking an awful lot of the reader, for sure.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.449
But it's a nice ideal to have in your mind.

36:38.890 --> 36:43.720
I've been in an interview with Robert Coles just a couple months ago.

36:43.740 --> 36:44.322
I love Coles.

36:44.342 --> 36:46.907
He's a psychiatrist who went to the children.

36:46.927 --> 36:48.651
Yes, I've read all his books.

36:49.188 --> 36:53.415
I was going to talk about a tall story.

36:53.435 --> 36:58.423
My mother used to say you have to have stories that you can live your lifetime.

36:58.443 --> 37:03.892
And so when he's doing classics, the power of literature is to give you stories that you can live your life.

37:03.912 --> 37:06.176
And he explained this.

37:06.196 --> 37:09.201
And I loved that whole concept.

37:09.221 --> 37:10.644
And I said, well, give me some examples.

37:10.764 --> 37:11.866
I did.

37:12.106 --> 37:12.487
It was magnificent.

37:12.507 --> 37:14.470
A little tall story story.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.378
Don't worry about it, we're getting plenty of good quotes.

37:19.478 --> 37:22.104
The book does, you know, I do write about the book too.

37:23.466 --> 37:28.076
We just put this together about two days a day after, forgive me for being, I should be a lot better prepared.

37:28.116 --> 37:31.803
You know, we just put this interview together two days ago.

37:31.823 --> 37:33.326
It's totally fine.

37:33.406 --> 37:37.234
I told Lisa I'd love to do it, I'm going to be a philosopher, so let's put it together.

37:38.598 --> 37:41.501
Can I call you if I have some questions?

37:41.982 --> 37:43.884
Can I reach you if I'm just going to give you a phone number?

37:43.924 --> 37:47.027
I probably won't, but if I have any questions, if you don't mind.

37:47.047 --> 37:49.650
Actually, I'm on tour.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.832
I'm going to be away for 10 days.

37:52.313 --> 37:55.356
If this is going to happen within the next 10 days... It might.

37:55.376 --> 38:01.803
I'm just thinking if there are questions I'd like to ask you for this book.

38:01.823 --> 38:02.944
416.

38:03.165 --> 38:03.445
416.

38:03.505 --> 38:04.206
480-9650.

38:04.546 --> 38:06.428
It's unlisted.

38:07.927 --> 38:14.433
I assure you, my database is sacred.

38:14.493 --> 38:19.178
You would believe some of the telephone numbers in there.

38:19.198 --> 38:22.641
But I would like to follow up on a couple of these things.

38:24.182 --> 38:35.453
Have you been thinking or are you going to write about any of this whole notion of books on disk and what it means to

38:35.888 --> 38:38.270
Do you have any opinions on that?

38:39.412 --> 39:00.954
Well, it's a very ... talk about a ghost library, because there's a lot of technology now, which is completely already so old, even though it's not that old in years, that people don't understand the language.

39:02.255 --> 39:05.018
They're actually specialists.

39:05.977 --> 39:11.709
You're talking about the process by which... Oh, that's true.

39:11.729 --> 39:14.795
You mean the way the material is stored, that you can't access.

39:14.835 --> 39:15.256
That's right.

39:15.637 --> 39:27.681
So there are these old experts who are being pulled out of retirement in order to read, just to gain access to this information.

39:28.235 --> 39:49.752
Carol, who kindly agreed to draw on the wonderful knowledge that she has obtained about the Rivers of America period to give us the overview that I think we need as the baseline for the discussions that we have today.

39:49.772 --> 39:50.293
We are allowed to applaud.

40:00.567 --> 40:03.812
Thank you, John, and good morning to you all.

40:04.873 --> 40:16.230
What joy it is for me to see so many of my friends and faithful correspondents gathered together to celebrate one of our country's finest literary praises, the service of America.

40:17.091 --> 40:24.301
I'm sure all of you join me in thanking John Cole and the subject of the book with a generous recognition of the series.

40:25.603 --> 40:26.845
I never think about this time.

40:31.432 --> 40:40.374
I never come to Washington without thinking of Frederick Tutank, Elizabeth Book, The Fortelling, and of the nation's river, as it's been called.

40:41.116 --> 40:47.010
One cannot help but expect a river to display such a large part in our nation's history

40:47.902 --> 41:02.084
I am honored to set the stage for today's symposium, whether it be authors, illustrators, math makers, editors, and publishers who make and continue to make the series for the creature that it is.

41:03.746 --> 41:14.162
Let's begin with the memory of a middle-aged lady of Canadian birth, a journalist, playwright, poet, a writer of children's adventure books,

41:14.530 --> 41:26.388
She was a dreamer who thought that the history of her adopted timeline, which she called America, often be told at the Coast Guard.

41:26.408 --> 41:32.498
It was the time of the Great Depression, 1935, when millions of Americans were struggling to fall.

41:33.098 --> 41:37.305
The lady was Constance Lindsey Skinner.

41:37.405 --> 41:41.331
Born in 1877, or perhaps 1879,

41:41.497 --> 41:51.066
And she dreamt that the history of America would be told, not as an epic poem, not as a prose chronicle, but through the story of America's river.

41:52.347 --> 42:03.438
In her essay, Rivers on America, she said, the natural rhythm, moving the pioneer life of America forward, was the rhythm of sewing water.

42:04.358 --> 42:09.343
It is as the story of American river that the first project would be told.

42:09.695 --> 42:17.127
And she said, she is great for the literary work to be written by novels and college.

42:17.147 --> 42:30.167
With this elegant idea, Constance, one of these dinner, was at the stage for what is one of America's most interesting, successful, and enduring literary endeavors, the Rivers of America.

42:31.261 --> 42:37.288
In 1934, Skinner found a publisher for her series, Farmer and Reinhardt.

42:37.309 --> 42:46.680
With a bright, young, energetic staff, this was the right place, with the right spirit, for a new of her adventure.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.643
Skinner was the same general editor.

42:48.663 --> 42:53.809
She announced that the series would encompass 24 volumes.

42:54.245 --> 43:07.900
Tenebeth, Cradle of American, Worcestershire I. Written by Robert T. Chrysler Coffin, a native of Maine, Tenebeth was published on June 14, 1937.

43:08.133 --> 43:23.341
Coffin, a poet, novelist, biographer, essayist, and critic, was a perfect example of the talent, really the genius, in her wonderful experience.

43:23.361 --> 43:26.327
Kennebec followed by going into her second printing in her first year.

43:27.151 --> 43:33.263
Fraulein Reinhardt was fully committed to Skinner's ideas and time standards, she said.

43:33.844 --> 43:36.770
They promoted the theory to heal and the enthusiasm.

43:37.672 --> 43:46.088
Her essay, Rivers an American Book, was reprinted in pamphlet form and is included in many literature books.

43:46.777 --> 43:56.154
Skinner selected some of the nation's best writers and illustrators for the series, but sadly, she lived to see only five of the books published.

43:56.856 --> 44:07.215
She died in 1939 while editing the Manuscripts of the Hutchins by Carl Thornman less than five years after she could begin the series.

44:08.579 --> 44:18.063
In 1940, Stephen Vincent Binet and Carl Palmer, both respected literary studios, were named as series editors.

44:18.083 --> 44:25.862
The Wabash, by William E. Wilson, published that year, was the first Binet-Carmer-Scrivers book.

44:25.842 --> 44:42.079
In selecting for the authors, the two authors maintain gender-high standards, naming, for example, Heidi Parker, James Branch Cattle, Edgar Lee Masters, Henry Staddle-Handy, and Henry Vestum, for folks in the series.

44:42.717 --> 45:01.713
with the publication of Dr. Thomas B. Clarke, her award, The Kentucky, the 15th volume of the series in 1942, Far and Reinhardt wisely decided to promote the series as a whole, rather than the individual book, urging its readers to collect them all.

45:02.534 --> 45:05.957
And I'm sure some book lovers do just that.

45:05.977 --> 45:11.982
Let us take note that 55 years later, Dr. Clarke's book is still comprehensive.

45:12.299 --> 45:20.654
The song book, Psalms of the Rivers of America, was published at this time in 1942.

45:20.674 --> 45:25.382
It contained 121 songs associated with rivers and river people.

45:25.462 --> 45:35.860
It was also at this time that the publisher issued the errant play, Map of the United States, a key part of a theory of emotion.

45:37.291 --> 45:49.275
1943, the series received the first Publisher's Newsweek, Barry Thomas Award, as the best example of creative publishing for the year of 1943.

45:49.762 --> 45:55.754
Over the years, 13 books were issued in special signings limited editions.

45:55.774 --> 45:58.580
Many of these were promoted regionally.

45:58.600 --> 46:09.643
The Brandywine, published in 1941, was written by Henry Stiegel-Handy and illustrated by the 23-year-old Andrew Weyer.

46:09.623 --> 46:25.461
Hansley and Wife signed 650 copies for the Greenwood Book Shop of Women's Deleter, and there is a copy of this rather rare book indicated here signed by Hansley and Wife.

46:25.481 --> 46:31.648
The report is now letter to me that he signed 1,000 sheets for the special edition of the family.

46:32.978 --> 46:44.216
Other illustrations of Rivers' books include John Stewart-Surley, the Wisconsin, Ross Tantese, author and artist, Akilah, and Cotter River.

46:44.236 --> 46:44.496
A.Y.

46:44.516 --> 46:49.625
Jackson, one of Canada's receivers through the sevens of St.

46:49.645 --> 46:49.825
Martin.

46:49.845 --> 46:55.614
Nikolai Bachen, often described as an American old master of Colorado.

46:55.634 --> 46:58.699
It was Lynn Ward, famous for his novels of Woodhead.

46:59.152 --> 47:11.645
There was even a husband and wife, Donald Davidson, who wrote the two volumes of the Tennessee, and his wife, Teresa's chair, made a decision to illustrate it then.

47:11.665 --> 47:15.675
The Tennessee is the only two-volume work in the Rivets area.

47:16.685 --> 47:28.313
I should note also in the principal series of cartographers, George Ann and Raphael Glacchio, also that their special mentions were the excellence of their work.

47:28.333 --> 47:31.420
Their map has kind of defined the subject.

47:32.378 --> 47:40.109
When Stephen Bixen-Binet died in 1943, Herbie Allen was named general editor.

47:40.129 --> 47:45.457
Allen's enormously successful novel, Anthony Eckert, had made him a little bit of a star.

47:46.518 --> 47:49.563
If star or not, he took his editor seriously.

47:50.825 --> 47:58.656
Karl Harmer, Binet's co-editor, had left the bar in Reinhardt briefly, but returned as Allen's co-editor.

47:59.547 --> 48:05.869
It was about this time that Jean Crawford became associate editor of Edison's service series.

48:05.889 --> 48:10.063
Many of the officers here today work with her on their roles.

48:10.735 --> 48:21.929
Kirby Allen, a man of prodigious talent and energy, continued to write successful novels while editing Rivers' manuscript and creatively promoting the series.

48:22.530 --> 48:32.102
He had home in New York and Florida to travel between them by trains and manage them at the same time to prepare for a spiritual life.

48:32.622 --> 48:44.241
In 1945, with the war over, many rivers' authors, illustrators, and editors began to return to civilian life.

48:44.261 --> 48:50.631
Four times paper choices were used, and the manufacturers and publications were with both success used.

48:50.982 --> 49:06.865
John Farrar returned to his service in 1944, but before these years end, he left the firm who had founded, apparently over to pursue both the Reinhard brothers, Finley, Stanley, and Frederick.

49:07.306 --> 49:15.758
Late the next year, 1945, he joined Roger Strauss and formed the publishing firm Farrar & Gun.

49:16.885 --> 49:28.423
In December 1945, the Reinhardt renamed their firm Reinhardt & M Company, followed in Reinhardt's two offices.

49:28.443 --> 49:34.152
The first members voted to bear the new Reinhardt Institute in California for college in 1946.

49:34.537 --> 49:41.244
The Shawgrass, River of Western Asset, by John B. Cimenter, was published in 1948.

49:42.245 --> 49:51.835
The Shawgrass, in Panama, is the only river in the series that is not in rural America.

49:51.855 --> 49:59.663
In December 1949, Herbie Allen unexpectedly died of his historic home in the 60s.

49:59.683 --> 50:04.408
He had edited 22 of the river's titles, 17 of which were published before he died.

50:04.895 --> 50:13.588
Carl Palmer was a senior editor, and Gene Cromford was a senior editor until the series ended in 1974.

50:13.608 --> 50:20.518
In the later years of the series, Palmer was a consulting editor.

50:20.538 --> 50:29.011
Tate Barnes, who was the last editor of the series, started from 1967 until 1974.

50:29.131 --> 50:31.915
Five days were the title for public during that series.

50:32.958 --> 50:36.421
The Reinhard Ferns from a skillfully promoted series.

50:36.962 --> 50:42.027
A good example is the promotion of the Ohio by Richard E. Vandenberg.

50:42.047 --> 50:45.591
The book was heavily publicized around the Ohio River Valley.

50:46.271 --> 50:58.864
The governors of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia proclaimed October 15, 1949, the day the book was published, Ohio's River Day.

50:58.844 --> 51:13.277
President Truman signed a copy of the book, which was later co-signed by about 250 others, governors, mayors, city councilmen, and other members along the way.

51:15.542 --> 51:17.005
I would love to remember that document.

51:16.985 --> 51:23.738
The French Broad was published in 1955.

51:23.818 --> 51:33.576
Now, or 40 years later, the French Broad has been reprinted at least eight times.

51:34.062 --> 51:50.158
Rivers' books were published under the Reinhardt imprint from 1946 until 1960 when Reinhardt merged the Penn Colton Company and the John Seenowitz Company to form post-Reinhardt-Naston.

51:50.739 --> 51:56.665
The last new Rivers title published by Reinhardt Company was the Merrimack by Raymond Colton.

51:56.685 --> 52:00.829
The Merrimack was illustrated by Aaron Kessler, who appeared to be blind.

52:01.872 --> 52:19.218
The first privilege title, published by the Colts, Reinhardt, and Blinken, was The Minnesotas Across the River by Evan Jones, which was illustrated by Harry Himes, who was also here in the morning.

52:19.238 --> 52:21.501
The Minnesotas, college in 1962, was a 50-year-old experience.

52:21.937 --> 52:27.089
In 1965, Pope Reinhardt and Winston published St.

52:27.449 --> 52:35.187
Croix by James Taylor Gunn, which was illustrated by Gerald Hazard, author and illustrator for those years.

52:35.740 --> 52:45.435
Hi, I love it by William Lee Ellis, published in 1966.

52:45.455 --> 52:52.245
The UConn by Richard Matthews and the Elkast by Ruth Leach, who was published in 1968.

52:52.265 --> 52:58.835
Mr. Ellis and Mr. Matthews are with us this morning, as it's George Miles to celebrate the LN.

52:58.855 --> 53:03.402
Martha Sanborn wrote the last part in the series, The American, Frederick Elton Roger, 1928-16.

53:04.158 --> 53:15.232
Pope Reinhardt was in the theater series in Missouri's completion in 1974.

53:15.252 --> 53:23.482
From 1937 to 1974, 65 titles were published, and over those years, all were kept in print.

53:23.502 --> 53:31.212
Two books in the series, the James and the Alabama City, were issued in the Islamic tradition and are counted as a set of values, part of the criminal trial service.

53:31.512 --> 53:35.102
In the 1940s, Ford Rivers' book, the St.

53:35.122 --> 53:42.062
Lawrence, Hatter River, the Hudson, and the Colorado, were published in our new circular exhibition.

53:42.262 --> 53:53.721
In 1951, Four Rivers Books were published by the British publisher William Hodge & Company for distribution and sales in Great Virginia.

53:53.741 --> 54:05.080
Barth Urban & Company and Toronto, a Canadian distributor of the river series, published two rivers pages, appraisers and a paperback edition of South Carolina.

54:05.482 --> 54:14.175
More than a third of the 55-year results are still in print, mostly through the efforts of universities and regional professors.

54:14.577 --> 54:29.794
The Rivers of America series, the product of Barbara and Reinhardt, Reinhardt & Helping, and Holtz, Reinhardt & Winston, is today the inheritance of Henry Holtz & Helping.

54:29.814 --> 54:34.880
This fine publishing firm, the Serpent of the Periods 1, by Mario Kassel, the director of Central Square.

54:34.900 --> 54:41.547
Henry Holtz & Helping has the most helpful to making connections with contacts and copyright information.

54:42.758 --> 54:47.734
Tell a few words about my collections and my work.

54:47.754 --> 54:50.743
I've been able to collect your books about 10 years ago.

54:50.943 --> 54:58.093
It wasn't long before in real life there was no bibliography of theories and other histories.

54:58.213 --> 55:11.051
In 1991, I began writing to any theory, authors, illustrators, or editors of designs, outlining the bibliography I hoped to write, and asking for relevant information.

55:11.071 --> 55:14.976
A lot of you here this morning got that first textless letter.

55:15.395 --> 55:19.560
I was simply astounded at the response of that speech.

55:19.580 --> 55:26.329
Some were following, some were funny, all of their values and invaluable.

55:26.349 --> 55:33.518
This was a control of people who were made as high as possible.

55:33.538 --> 55:36.542
Sadly, some of the so-called community in those early days are never longer with us.

55:37.720 --> 55:41.925
I decided that there was a story to tell and history to preserve.

55:42.466 --> 56:06.597
Now, nearly six years later, I have finished the bibliographical description of more than 350 editions and printings of Riverport, written in publishing of three of the series, and completed biographical collections of 50 authors, $65 readers, three math majors, and perhaps a dozen editors and publishers.

56:06.577 --> 56:16.130
My river collection now stands at more than a significant volume.

56:16.471 --> 56:25.303
The river's authors, illustrators, editors, and book dealers who are here this morning, and others who could not join us, have been incredibly timed and helpful.

56:25.464 --> 56:26.285
Many point out those friends.

56:26.565 --> 56:33.155
I have a special thanks to Dr. Allen Mervyn Cloud of Nashville for his unflagged support and constant encouragement.

56:33.175 --> 56:35.638
He is a true friend of the river.

56:36.209 --> 56:57.677
My book will be a descriptive bibliography, not a literary analysis of the series or a sociological account of the time, but I believe that the published history and the biographies of the authors, illustrators, and painters I have included will carry the book well beyond the limits of conventional bibliography.

56:57.657 --> 57:07.495
I hope so, because my objective has been to record the story of the men and women who created it.

57:07.515 --> 57:16.712
Many of the rivers are out of print, and the rivers themselves have changed, some of the better, other systems of a careless society.

57:16.692 --> 57:36.321
It is the account of a unique boy reported, illustrated, and edited by a talented and famous group of men and women during a time of unparalleled popular interest in America, and their work was gone.

57:37.128 --> 57:54.689
From Kennebeth's cradle of Americans to the American River of El Dorado, from Maine, California, from 1937 to 1934, Constance and Heath's fair three has been their life.

57:54.709 --> 58:05.042
The Rivers of America series stands as a monument of literary excellence and an enduring story of America, her people, and her workplace.

58:05.022 --> 58:20.753
It is fitting, I think, that the first and last book in the series will end to those who have Americans in their titles for the series itself assuring Americans in every positive way.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.544
Thank you, Carol.

58:38.564 --> 58:47.063
We all know the knowledge and the effort and the love on which that she was built, really.

58:47.083 --> 58:55.262
Her knowledge and Carol's drive and thoroughness as a collector, I think also contributed to the importance of

58:55.242 --> 59:18.330
collecting the amateur spirit of the collector who, in fact, overcomes the professional in so many ways with enthusiasm and an overview of the importance of the series that I think is a magnificent contribution that she has made as a collector and now as a historian of her.

59:18.732 --> 59:32.032
I'd like now to introduce Dr. Jane Billingham, who is our Librarian of Congress.

59:32.052 --> 59:34.816
Dr. Billingham was the Librarian of Congress in 1987.

59:34.836 --> 59:40.504
She is a strong advocate of the Library of Congress in every way, and very cool that she was able to join us today with Dr. Jane Billingham.

59:45.935 --> 59:58.675
Hi, my name is John, and it's my great pleasure to have my belated voice and welcome to John and Hunter's family last night.

59:59.015 --> 01:00:10.373
I'm sorry that I couldn't be living by here for the most of my case, but I'm sorry for the night.

01:00:10.353 --> 01:00:19.300
but I, excuse me, particularly .

01:00:19.634 --> 01:00:24.100
The mission will be set as a book.

01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:27.685
Margaret, this is most exciting to me, and I think most important.

01:00:27.705 --> 01:00:29.988
They're doing a lot of two sensations in there.

01:00:30.008 --> 01:00:37.718
They're moving along to these two-sided boats, and we're trying to find two sides, I think they're able to bring them into the world, of course.

01:00:38.018 --> 01:00:45.027
So people are getting exposed to that, some of the things that the world gives back in to the world, of course.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.249
There are no subjects to have

01:00:46.465 --> 01:00:51.092
because it is more important than the congregation of folks and the congregation of the district.
