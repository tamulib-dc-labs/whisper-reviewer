WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:12.178
Everything he got at home and here, he got with his knowledge and his brain.

00:12.218 --> 00:16.703
He never worked for anybody ever since I was born or before I was born.

00:17.124 --> 00:22.449
Everything he amassed, he was extremely well-read and super knowledgeable.

00:22.950 --> 00:28.756
Where he learned everything, I have no idea, but he was brilliant to say the least.

00:29.877 --> 00:30.358
He knew

00:30.625 --> 00:34.591
The history of everything he collected in depth, you know, not just the surface knowledge.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.095
And he had big tastes.

00:37.135 --> 00:45.707
He collected everything from antique jewelry, ancient art, ancient things, rare books, manuscripts, all kinds of paper materials.

00:45.727 --> 00:46.649
He collected rare books?

00:46.829 --> 00:47.169
Oh, yeah.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.752
I have all of this stuff.

00:49.513 --> 00:50.414
I live down the street.

00:50.454 --> 00:53.439
Even his home takes up a whole city block.

00:54.220 --> 00:59.788
And the yard, the grounds are littered with great architectural stone, antique statuary.

01:00.393 --> 01:14.092
He was into gardening and got a great collection of books on gardening and paintings and bronzes and you name it and the odds are I got a collection of it.

01:14.613 --> 01:27.531
Yeah, self-taught, self-taught and a lot of things he sort of fell into at a time, you know, years ago you could go shopping for antiques and buy great things.

01:28.011 --> 01:29.353
Now it's a whole different

01:29.671 --> 01:30.372
How you doing?

01:30.512 --> 01:32.475
The things have disappeared off the market.

01:32.975 --> 01:34.337
So my father had the vision.

01:35.178 --> 01:38.363
Like, he knew 50 years ago what was going to be good today.

01:38.423 --> 01:46.093
Unfortunately, he died, but he accumulated huge amounts of things because he didn't believe in stocks and bonds.

01:46.113 --> 01:47.475
His family was from Europe and all.

01:47.535 --> 01:52.461
In Europe, paper currency seems to change with the governments all the time.

01:52.842 --> 01:54.564
So my father believed in objects.

01:55.045 --> 01:57.568
He said to me, objects are always good.

01:57.835 --> 02:02.044
Even in times of a depression, there's still plenty of rich people around.

02:02.084 --> 02:07.876
Even though the whole country could be going lousy, there'll still be a lot of millionaires that are going to be solid no matter what.

02:08.377 --> 02:12.585
So if you have nice things, there'll always be a market for them.

02:12.926 --> 02:14.850
I've seen him described as a collector.

02:14.950 --> 02:15.912
This is a collection.

02:16.195 --> 02:18.698
Was he also a dealer, would you say?

02:18.718 --> 02:19.038
Oh, yeah.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.780
Was he doing this because- Master dealer.

02:21.060 --> 02:22.442
Best salesman I've ever seen.

02:22.462 --> 02:24.964
He had total control of the language.

02:24.984 --> 02:26.906
He could speak beautifully.

02:26.926 --> 02:28.548
He knew every word in the dictionary.

02:28.568 --> 02:32.612
It's Latin derivation.

02:33.473 --> 02:36.637
My father in his prime, he must have been as sharp as they come.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.499
But he was honest.

02:38.819 --> 02:41.562
He made his biggest-

02:41.862 --> 02:43.484
What's the correct word?

02:43.684 --> 02:47.668
He made his biggest score by being honest.

02:47.928 --> 02:49.790
He did really well.

02:49.810 --> 02:56.376
He went from being poor to fairly wealthy in one day by treating an older woman the right way.

02:56.656 --> 02:58.558
How did he win one day?

02:58.598 --> 03:02.182
He was open in 1933 in the Dulesville.

03:02.202 --> 03:07.887
He was open on Saturday when most of the other dealers were closed.

03:08.170 --> 03:09.973
Because there was a depression on it in those days.

03:09.993 --> 03:14.059
Times were really tough, so it was open because every bit of money he could earn, he needed it.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.923
So this woman walks into the little building.

03:17.124 --> 03:19.628
She's all dressed in black with a black veil and everything.

03:20.709 --> 03:23.814
Oh, $25.

03:23.934 --> 03:29.122
Anyway, she says, Mr. Epstein, I see you're open.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.005
I have this silver spoon.

03:31.643 --> 03:33.205
I want to sell it because I need the money.

03:33.225 --> 03:36.190
In those days, they would just weigh it and pay you the money.

03:36.210 --> 03:41.718
So he takes a spoon in the back, and he tests it with nitric acid, and the spoon turned out to be gold.

03:42.459 --> 03:46.865
But now he says to himself, well, I could pay the woman for the silver and score.

03:46.885 --> 03:50.650
This is a nice little score I'd make, or I could tell her.

03:50.671 --> 03:51.972
So he decides to tell her.

03:52.914 --> 03:55.177
And the woman literally freaked out.

03:55.197 --> 04:00.705
She said, I had a whole service for 12 of this, and I've been selling it to all the other dealers in the city.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.165
You know, for silver.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.830
So, but you're an honest young man.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.214
You told me what it's worth it.

04:08.234 --> 04:11.198
My father said, well, I don't have enough money on me to pay you the gold.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.159
She said, don't worry about it.

04:12.660 --> 04:13.602
Come out to my house.

04:14.363 --> 04:20.291
So it turned out the woman was the widow of the president of the First National Bank.

04:20.311 --> 04:26.240
She made my father the agent in charge of liquidating all her assets.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.702
She wanted to move to Mexico.

04:27.722 --> 04:28.343
Do you remember her name?

04:28.904 --> 04:30.186
No, I don't.

04:30.588 --> 04:35.553
I know that we had a Willie's, an old Willie's.

04:35.613 --> 04:37.435
And the next guy we got was a Rolls Royce.

04:37.555 --> 04:40.158
And she had stuff.

04:41.380 --> 04:47.606
So he went, and then he made enough liquidating her assets to go into the jewelry business.

04:47.686 --> 04:49.628
And he became like a Tiffany's.

04:49.668 --> 04:51.030
My father was a custom jeweler.

04:51.070 --> 04:52.031
I got things he made.

04:52.431 --> 04:53.513
He was like a Fabergé.

04:53.653 --> 04:54.093
My father.

04:54.574 --> 04:56.796
You know where E.B.

04:56.836 --> 04:57.277
Horns is?

04:57.357 --> 04:58.258
Everybody knows E.B.

04:58.278 --> 04:58.498
Horns.

04:58.738 --> 04:59.619
I'm walking by E.B.

04:59.639 --> 05:00.460
Horns one day.

05:01.064 --> 05:02.267
always looked in their window.

05:02.347 --> 05:06.479
And there's a bracelet my father made in the center of the window where the best stuff is.

05:07.301 --> 05:08.103
I said, I'll be damned.

05:08.123 --> 05:09.326
So I go in E.B.

05:09.346 --> 05:14.500
Holland and I said, that bracelet in the window, oh, that's a very rare antique piece.

05:14.750 --> 05:15.552
And I said, no, it isn't.

05:15.592 --> 05:16.494
My father made it.

05:16.575 --> 05:17.377
I said, I'll buy it.

05:17.497 --> 05:18.459
So we brings it out.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.164
I said, his name's going to be inside.

05:20.184 --> 05:22.931
We parked it over and said, George Epstein.

05:23.131 --> 05:25.638
The sign downstairs says, George Epstein, antiquarian.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.522
He thought of himself as an antiquarian.

05:27.542 --> 05:28.846
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

05:28.866 --> 05:29.989
The Globe rated him.

05:30.109 --> 05:31.452
There's an article on The Globe.

05:31.472 --> 05:32.134
They call him

05:32.654 --> 05:34.116
A scavenger.

05:34.136 --> 05:35.417
My mother and I didn't like that.

05:36.358 --> 05:38.400
But he wasn't a scavenger.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.702
He was a real connoisseur.

05:40.483 --> 05:41.083
Antiquarian.

05:41.103 --> 05:45.108
Well, that's why I took a picture of that sign, because I write about antiquarians.

05:45.128 --> 05:46.549
This is my interest.

05:46.569 --> 05:47.590
Tell me a little bit about that.

05:47.670 --> 05:52.035
Did he consider all of this artifactual stuff?

05:52.055 --> 05:54.898
Did he feel that he was preserving history and culture?

05:55.419 --> 05:56.660
Oh, absolutely.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.303
There was a time when all the old mansions

05:59.637 --> 06:02.441
You know, usually an old mansion would be on a big tract of land.

06:02.461 --> 06:04.084
A lot of land would go with the old estate.

06:04.144 --> 06:09.411
So usually the years would take down the mansion because they were going to develop the land.

06:10.433 --> 06:14.919
So for a number of years, I was in a great old mansion every week.

06:15.580 --> 06:23.592
And when you work in these mansions, you end up knowing the family that it came from and the source of their income.

06:24.233 --> 06:27.518
And you got to learn a lot about a whole different

06:27.768 --> 06:50.236
clicker society than you were used to and also you met a lot of nice people so my father through the course of dealing with the old mansions and then lots of old Plymouth, old Salem, old Boston was being torn down and by then we were pretty well established as the only nut in the business that bought this old stuff.

06:50.257 --> 06:51.358
The only one?

06:51.418 --> 06:51.939
No one else?

06:52.019 --> 06:56.965
Yeah, the records would call up my father and say well George we got another mansion

06:57.704 --> 06:59.185
And another one next week.

06:59.446 --> 07:01.548
There used to be lots of great old homes.

07:02.068 --> 07:04.311
You didn't realize how many millionaires there must have been.

07:05.352 --> 07:06.433
So we were working.

07:06.473 --> 07:08.375
And what a nice job it was.

07:08.435 --> 07:14.401
I can't explain to going into these places and, you know, can have everything you want because you bought it.

07:14.581 --> 07:20.407
In fact, I just bought, even though I'm sort of retired now, I couldn't resist this one.

07:21.147 --> 07:24.331
I got a call from General Patton's family.

07:24.851 --> 07:26.833
They have a huge estate in Native.

07:27.033 --> 07:34.906
I sold this place, but I didn't sell him the phone number and the customer clientele and the name.

07:35.226 --> 07:43.520
So I got a call, so I went out with Mr. Kaminsky, and what a place, and wow, I'm going to do well on this place.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.306
She's still in the business.

07:47.326 --> 07:49.529
You're still in the business.

07:49.810 --> 07:54.357
I don't own this place, but I can bring anything up here I want.

07:55.163 --> 07:57.326
He wants to buy my house and the contents.

07:57.526 --> 07:58.487
So can I see it?

07:58.507 --> 07:59.108
Yeah.

07:59.469 --> 08:07.839
Believe me, my place is a whole city block, in front of a whole block, right down the street, next up to one street to the next.

08:07.859 --> 08:08.901
And it was built in 1750.

08:09.481 --> 08:09.782
Gorgeous.

08:09.802 --> 08:10.443
1750?

08:10.763 --> 08:11.043
Yeah.

08:11.103 --> 08:12.886
It's got a barn and a farm.

08:12.906 --> 08:16.450
If I blindfolded you and took you there, you'd think you're in Lexington and Concord.

08:17.031 --> 08:18.573
And it's gorgeous.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.015
And it's filled.

08:20.736 --> 08:22.919
I interrupted you talking about the patent and the state.

08:22.939 --> 08:23.179
I apologize.

08:23.480 --> 08:46.618
you're talking about the patent and the state nature yeah oh well anyway i got a call a couple weeks ago to do i still uh there's old mansions i said yes we have an old house and when i went out to it uh so i spoke with the developer and they're going to take it down as well i'll i'll buy uh everything i want i'll buy like the rights to the times

08:47.054 --> 08:48.376
But I went with Kaminsky.

08:48.396 --> 08:51.801
He said, well, we'll buy this mantle and this and this and this.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.825
I said, that's not how we do it.

08:53.845 --> 08:55.267
We buy everything we want.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.851
We'll pay you for like, let me stay here for two weeks.

08:57.891 --> 08:59.514
I got my own man truck and all.

09:00.575 --> 09:01.517
And that's the way you buy it.

09:01.777 --> 09:03.139
He wanted to pick, in other words.

09:03.179 --> 09:04.542
Yeah, so that's killing yourself.

09:04.562 --> 09:05.183
You don't do that.

09:05.223 --> 09:06.965
You buy everything.

09:08.107 --> 09:09.289
And you can take what you want.

09:09.690 --> 09:10.771
You buy time, really.

09:10.831 --> 09:11.833
Your father taught you that.

09:12.093 --> 09:12.334
Oh, yeah.

09:12.354 --> 09:13.095
I learned how to.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.223
buy and sell a lot from my father.

09:15.243 --> 09:15.944
He could sell anything.

09:16.045 --> 09:18.850
So did he have some theories, some philosophy?

09:18.890 --> 09:20.072
He was real cynical.

09:20.092 --> 09:26.123
My father was a real cynical person and everything he predicted to me came true.

09:26.824 --> 09:27.265
Everything.

09:28.107 --> 09:34.999
He was really sharp on matters of economics, politics,

09:35.182 --> 09:38.467
I never met anybody that knew as much as he did.

09:38.487 --> 09:40.550
I mean, you couldn't out-talk him on anything.

09:40.610 --> 09:41.872
I don't care what your subject was.

09:41.892 --> 09:42.854
He was pretty sharp.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.276
What do you think got him started on this?

09:46.419 --> 09:47.841
He came to Boston.

09:47.861 --> 09:49.043
Well, he was a jeweler.

09:49.404 --> 09:50.165
The woman with his name.

09:50.185 --> 09:51.787
He was a jeweler originally.

09:51.888 --> 10:00.521
And then when the Second World War ended, the jewelry business sort of ended also because all the big money sort of stopped with the war.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.265
And things slowed down.

10:03.464 --> 10:07.168
What about his family, his background?

10:08.089 --> 10:11.273
My father has a brother and a sister.

10:11.373 --> 10:11.954
He had a brother.

10:11.994 --> 10:13.796
Give you an idea how close the family was.

10:14.276 --> 10:16.559
When I was 13, I was bar mitzvahed.

10:16.619 --> 10:21.224
My father's brother came to the bar mitzvah.

10:21.264 --> 10:22.586
He was a diamond dealer.

10:23.627 --> 10:24.528
That's why I'm 13.

10:24.588 --> 10:29.033
Now, when I'm about 53, 40 years later,

10:29.519 --> 10:32.343
I see Izzy on Bromfield Street in Boston.

10:32.923 --> 10:36.768
I recognized him, even though I hadn't spoken for 40 years.

10:36.829 --> 10:38.311
They weren't mad at each other.

10:38.551 --> 10:40.133
There was no need to speak to each other.

10:40.453 --> 10:48.324
And now I'm walking up Bromfield Street, and Izzy's walking down Bromfield Street.

10:48.344 --> 10:48.604
There you go.

10:48.624 --> 10:49.125
That was it.

10:50.366 --> 10:51.107
He knew who you were.

10:51.187 --> 10:53.991
Yeah, I knew who he was.

10:54.393 --> 10:57.097
George, the spelling of George, it's almost Spanish.

10:57.157 --> 11:10.116
Well, his name was Julius, and he didn't like it, so we changed it to George with a J. I'd like to get in touch with you and follow up and give you an idea of what we're doing.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.337
Could you give me a phone number?

11:11.498 --> 11:12.559
What's Julius doing?

11:12.659 --> 11:18.488
I write books, and I'd like to send you a copy of a book that I did, and I'm writing a new book, and I do magazine work.

11:18.508 --> 11:20.190
I just did a piece for Smithsonian magazines.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.632
Yeah, we sold them a lot of stuff.

11:21.832 --> 11:24.836
In fact, my father got some of the laws of the Smithsonian Chains.

11:25.898 --> 11:32.748
We sold them a cavern, an 18th century cavern, and we delivered it to them.

11:32.768 --> 11:44.486
So when we backed up to the warehouse to unload the load, there was a huge warehouse, and the floor, say, 100 feet by 100 feet was being worked on.

11:44.506 --> 11:49.273
It was a huge pit, and in the pit were all these colored stones,

11:49.658 --> 11:51.561
It was deep, too, filled with stone.

11:51.861 --> 11:56.487
And over the stone were these planks so that we could walk, you know, have a wheelbarrow.

11:56.948 --> 12:01.334
Anyway, in unloading the truck, I'm taking a dolly or a wheelbarrow.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.136
I forgot that I was much younger then.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.558
And I fell into the pit.

12:04.639 --> 12:06.801
And then when you fall, I grabbed something.

12:07.022 --> 12:08.223
So I grabbed this rock.

12:09.265 --> 12:10.046
And it was purple.

12:10.406 --> 12:11.147
And I picked it up.

12:11.508 --> 12:14.432
And it was an amethyst about deciding a football.

12:14.933 --> 12:16.695
So then I...

12:17.131 --> 12:19.354
My father was a jeweler and everything.

12:19.654 --> 12:24.100
I looked around the pit, and the pit was filled with a geologic collection.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.782
Awesome collection.

12:25.862 --> 12:27.223
And you literally fell into it.

12:27.244 --> 12:27.484
Yeah.

12:27.684 --> 12:33.431
Dinosaurs, footprints, polished fossils, petrified logs of wood.

12:33.451 --> 12:38.137
We had a different, under the... In the Smithsonian, the pit that we walked in was filled.

12:38.778 --> 12:39.799
Do you need me?

12:39.819 --> 12:40.320
Yeah, real quick.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.061
I'm sorry.

12:41.081 --> 12:45.847
A couple of, across the area where the columns are, a couple of looted pilates.

12:45.867 --> 12:46.227
Big.

12:46.628 --> 12:47.109
square.

12:47.790 --> 12:48.491
It's quite tall.

12:48.531 --> 12:49.453
They're matching.

12:49.513 --> 12:51.116
They're matching pieces.

12:51.136 --> 12:55.023
I said they're 150-foot pieces.

12:55.043 --> 12:55.964
They are big size.

12:57.327 --> 13:01.013
Let me just take a look out the right way.

13:03.217 --> 13:03.878
Thank you.

13:04.060 --> 13:29.173
It was easy, you could latch it easy because the rope or the nylon bands would go, throw it and the crane lifted it, not that heavy, and the crane lifted it right off a flathead.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.192
truck right up to the roof.

13:31.933 --> 13:33.636
Later on, we built this base for it.

13:34.216 --> 13:37.180
This was originally going to go to the Seacast.

13:37.241 --> 13:39.884
But economically, they fell through.

13:40.765 --> 13:43.189
It was going to be like an information or a ticket booth.

13:43.469 --> 13:49.657
I know you said you got to get downstairs, but you were telling me briefly about how your father had something with changing a regulation.

13:49.677 --> 13:51.360
Oh, yeah, I was telling you, I just misown you.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.461
So I fell into this

13:52.812 --> 13:59.500
pit with the rock, and the rock didn't turn out to be regular rock, it was all fabulous geologic stuff.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.162
So I said, Dad, look at this.

14:02.263 --> 14:13.796
So he knew immediately, he ran over and got one of the curators, and he said, listen, instead of—and they were going around crushing the rock, and the cement truck was filling it in.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.841
So my father said,

14:18.496 --> 14:22.721
You know, instead of paying me for the tavern, let me just load up the truck with this rock.

14:23.702 --> 14:24.883
It was tons of truckloads.

14:25.224 --> 14:29.729
So they said, Mr. Epstein, if you think this is thickening, let me take you.

14:29.769 --> 14:30.350
Come on, Norman.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.971
You can take the amethyst with you.

14:32.352 --> 14:33.653
Come on, Norman, and I'll take you.

14:33.854 --> 14:40.862
He took us up to an incinerator room where they were sawing up and burning old 18th century American furniture.

14:41.282 --> 14:44.706
Then we went out to a courtyard where there was a big 80-foot tavern.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.562
a Polynesian war canoe.

14:47.582 --> 14:50.385
And two men were dousing it with gasoline, and he lit it.

14:50.505 --> 14:53.688
It was unbelievable.

14:53.708 --> 14:54.529
He was stunned.

14:54.549 --> 14:58.613
I mean, it was unreal to see this destruction in the Smithsonian.

14:59.714 --> 15:07.982
So when he got back to Boston, he got—somehow or other, he got a personal appointment with John F. Kennedy, who was a senator then.

15:08.642 --> 15:14.608
So when he sat down with Kennedy for about two hours, which is unprecedented,

15:15.584 --> 15:27.159
And he got Kennedy to introduce legislation changing the policies of the Smithsonian so they could loan things out, they could sell things, they could trade things.

15:27.419 --> 15:29.042
Before, they couldn't do any of that.

15:29.282 --> 15:32.947
So they had so much stuff, we can't give it away, we can't sell it, we can't loan it.

15:33.187 --> 15:33.828
So what's left?

15:33.908 --> 15:34.809
We've got to get rid of it.

15:35.390 --> 15:39.976
So my father is responsible for changing that law.

15:40.076 --> 15:40.577
That's great.

15:40.597 --> 15:45.523
So now they can loan things, show things, buy and sell.

15:46.229 --> 16:01.977
instead of just then we were in warehouses you know people would die leave the smithsonian collections so lots of people leaving stuff so they had warehouses filled with crates and stuff and the workmen i don't you don't have to record this okay

16:03.948 --> 16:06.372
So he said, oh, it's kind of that box there, you know.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.517
He said he has to get out of state.

16:10.159 --> 16:16.089
What I caught from the paper and the reading about the family is the preservation, and this is what we've been looking for.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.835
Well, we got the oldest door down, you know, just recently.

16:20.516 --> 16:21.959
We took down the Blanchett house.

16:22.339 --> 16:25.945
Now, there was a house my father really went out of his way to try and save.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.409
It was a house built in 1657.

16:29.071 --> 16:29.331
Wow.

16:29.969 --> 16:31.031
And all original.

16:31.191 --> 16:35.297
And as time went on, they would just add to the house, not take anything down.

16:35.398 --> 16:41.167
So a guy had bought the land that was on, an Italian contractor who was into Formica.

16:41.207 --> 16:42.308
He wanted a new modern.

16:43.030 --> 16:47.757
So my father went to the historicals, $65.

16:47.917 --> 16:48.578
Yeah, $65.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.361
All right, whatever you say.

16:50.581 --> 16:52.464
Yeah, he, no lower.

16:54.147 --> 16:54.428
No.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.010
I mean...

16:56.294 --> 17:00.280
I can price things $2, but it's going to come back and hit on us.

17:00.841 --> 17:06.108
I can't get fired, but he can.

17:08.472 --> 17:09.734
I sell it for $20.

17:09.834 --> 17:10.675
Now I don't care.

17:10.895 --> 17:12.358
How do you feel seeing all this stuff?

17:12.558 --> 17:17.285
Let me just tell you about the Blanchett house.

17:17.906 --> 17:18.767
We tried everything.

17:19.308 --> 17:22.252
Finally, we got the Italian contract.

17:22.312 --> 17:24.175
I want that house down.

17:24.526 --> 17:29.591
convinced the guy to give him a couple months, and we took it down piece by piece.

17:29.611 --> 17:34.576
And in the house I found, my father found, an overmantle painting.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.057
You know what an overmantle painting is?

17:36.237 --> 17:46.688
Over the fireplace on a big board was like a mural or a painting of a Thanksgiving feast with the Indians and the pilgrims and everything, pre-1700.

17:46.868 --> 17:51.192
I just saw that about two months ago.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.742
and Mr. Kaminsky.

17:52.762 --> 18:01.899
And I found the original front door, the original house, the original front door, the first Caucasian front door, you might say, original.

18:01.939 --> 18:03.001
That's in the greenhouse.

18:03.061 --> 18:03.903
I think he still got it.

18:04.063 --> 18:04.804
Let's take a look at it.

18:04.824 --> 18:05.025
Yeah.

18:05.305 --> 18:09.573
So anyway, but the overmantle painting, my father had it home.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.218
And I

18:12.788 --> 18:14.110
A lot of nice people come in here.

18:14.150 --> 18:15.272
You get to talking with them.

18:15.632 --> 18:23.965
And I was speaking with a woman named Mrs. Dalton, who was an old Yankee money society woman, but very well educated.

18:24.386 --> 18:26.930
And she loves the old things.

18:26.950 --> 18:30.436
So I told her, I said, oh, at home I got a painting and I described it.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.080
And Kaminsky saw it also.

18:34.582 --> 18:37.467
So he asked me how much it was, and I told him.

18:37.487 --> 18:38.408
He said, oh, it's very...

18:38.692 --> 18:45.023
And I said, then the woman, about a week later, she asked me, because I had it all to my house, bang, she bought it on the spot.

18:45.043 --> 18:46.125
They gave me a check immediately.

18:47.227 --> 18:52.135
So anyway, a couple weeks goes by, and Frank says to me, I want to get that painting.

18:52.155 --> 18:53.478
I said, it's gone.

18:53.959 --> 18:54.439
He said, what?

18:54.820 --> 18:55.962
It was worth $40,000.

18:55.982 --> 18:57.645
I said, well.

18:57.828 --> 19:00.512
When you saw it, why didn't you buy it?

19:00.792 --> 19:02.134
See, a lot of these guys are slick.

19:02.154 --> 19:03.296
They want to make the score.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.959
So he outscored himself on that one.

19:07.421 --> 19:08.182
What about your mother?

19:08.202 --> 19:09.865
Did she always accommodate?

19:09.965 --> 19:19.738
Did she always feel that it's... Well, my mother, not really so much into antiques, but putting up with my father for 50 or 60 years, you learn a lot on the way.

19:19.758 --> 19:24.745
Like, a lot of people don't realize, but you get more wisdom as you get older, in spite of yourself.

19:24.785 --> 19:26.788
Even if you're the stupidest person in the world,

19:27.089 --> 19:30.674
You do learn as you get older, unless you're really dense.

19:30.694 --> 19:31.815
Most people learn.

19:32.176 --> 19:39.506
My mother, a lot of the things that we got, she was with my father when he bought a lot of them.

19:40.307 --> 19:43.071
A lot of things to make my mother cry.

19:43.111 --> 19:49.560
When she saw the article in the paper with my father's picture, my mother can cry immediately.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.245
She just misses my father.

19:53.285 --> 19:54.046
She really loved him.

19:54.086 --> 19:54.767
My mother was

19:55.152 --> 19:57.655
I like to find a girl like my mother for myself.

19:58.596 --> 20:02.982
She was devoted, loved my father when he was sick, went to the hospital.

20:03.042 --> 20:07.488
Every day, no matter what, she would spend the time with him.

20:07.608 --> 20:08.910
It was a long ride to the hospital.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.872
My mother is 82.

20:12.534 --> 20:14.156
Absolutely super devoted.

20:15.858 --> 20:19.483
People have relationships.

20:20.645 --> 20:22.527
I've had girlfriends, but

20:22.642 --> 20:26.913
I haven't found any women as devoted as my mother was to my father.

20:26.973 --> 20:29.940
I want a woman who's devoted to me.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.865
How do you feel seeing this stuff leave?

20:31.885 --> 20:32.306
Oh, good.

20:32.667 --> 20:33.289
You do?

20:33.409 --> 20:34.011
Would your dad be here?

20:34.031 --> 20:36.617
I'd rather it go to a good home than right up here

20:37.019 --> 20:38.500
for eternity.

20:39.241 --> 20:44.727
And I want to see the fellow do well, because then I'll be sure that he can make his final thing.

20:44.747 --> 20:47.309
How would your father feel to stand up here and watch people get in his stuff?

20:47.329 --> 20:48.670
Oh, he wouldn't put up with this at all.

20:50.052 --> 20:51.173
It was by appointments only.

20:51.193 --> 20:52.074
You had to have an appointment.

20:52.134 --> 20:52.694
Is that right?

20:52.894 --> 20:54.216
Well, we didn't have the crew.

20:54.696 --> 20:56.298
In other words, there was no browsing.

20:56.318 --> 21:00.322
If you wanted to come in here and browse, there was a fee, a $150 fee for an hour.

21:00.582 --> 21:03.685
Then at the end of the hour, you got a merchandise credit,

21:03.867 --> 21:07.493
But it cost money to kill the day, put on the lights, employ people.

21:08.053 --> 21:11.058
And the fee eliminated the riffraff.

21:11.078 --> 21:14.003
The real buyers, the people that were serious, the fee is nothing to them.

21:15.806 --> 21:17.588
Well, it brought in the serious people.

21:17.989 --> 21:21.755
I saw some people buy, like one, you heard of the Friday's restaurants?

21:22.296 --> 21:28.625
Well, one day, the owner of Friday's came in here with his secretary, I guess.

21:29.547 --> 21:32.271
And my father took him around, personally.

21:32.521 --> 21:34.905
and showed them tons of stuff and they wrote everything down.

21:35.786 --> 21:39.051
Then the owner of Friday says to my father, oh, Mr. F signed up.

21:39.512 --> 21:42.837
He didn't quote me prices, but charge my man whatever you want.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.821
I'll take everything and we'll give you a check.

21:45.841 --> 21:48.005
So the guy didn't even care what the stuff cost.

21:48.025 --> 21:51.350
See, those were the kind of sales that you liked.

21:51.490 --> 21:56.858
I've had a lot of people in here that were just, and my father believed in business, sell a product

21:57.192 --> 21:59.034
You deal with the wealthy people.

21:59.274 --> 22:02.278
The poor people are nice, but in terms of doing business, you can write them off.

22:02.919 --> 22:05.501
So it's nice to sell things where people don't care what it costs.

22:05.521 --> 22:10.767
If they like it, when you're a multimillionaire, if someone costs $10,000 or $20,000, it's nothing to you.

22:10.988 --> 22:12.269
If you like it, you'll get it.

22:12.589 --> 22:15.293
Whereas a poor person, $20,000, oh, jeez.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.554
What was this building?

22:16.574 --> 22:17.375
This is a huge building.

22:17.395 --> 22:18.136
Yeah, we built this.

22:18.216 --> 22:18.817
Oh, you built it?

22:19.277 --> 22:19.858
Yeah.

22:19.878 --> 22:23.622
We had filled up the downstairs, and things were coming in so fast.

22:24.023 --> 22:27.368
truckloads at a time that, uh, how you doing?

22:27.989 --> 22:31.776
Things were coming in so fast that, uh, we needed more room, so.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.679
You built this whole building, the downstairs?

22:33.699 --> 22:36.082
No, the downstairs, but he did a lot of, all the windows.

22:36.103 --> 22:36.603
What was that?

22:36.623 --> 22:38.767
All the windows in the front, we put the windows in.

22:38.807 --> 22:43.855
He put a fortune into this building, but when we were making a lot of money, it was either

22:43.936 --> 22:47.020
invest in your property or give it to the internal revenue.

22:48.763 --> 22:52.748
He must have had one of the kind of things people were happy to just to find it here.

22:52.768 --> 22:53.429
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:53.449 --> 22:56.574
But like I said, I have these videos he made years ago.

22:57.415 --> 22:59.638
Yeah, years ago of things then.

22:59.959 --> 23:08.070
So when I look at the videos and the videos would show the whole place and he'd go through the whole place and you look at the videos and you see how this

23:08.354 --> 23:12.200
The stock years ago would have been with billions today.

23:13.362 --> 23:14.844
Well, it was easy.

23:14.864 --> 23:15.946
He had no competition.

23:16.426 --> 23:24.138
He couldn't believe how that great walnut carved mantle, you're going to trash it.

23:24.158 --> 23:24.999
I mean, give it to me.

23:25.079 --> 23:27.443
I'll take it for nothing, even if I got to store it.

23:27.592 --> 23:32.180
Yeah, and then when everybody you see on television, I waited on them.

23:32.480 --> 23:40.695
If you were building a great house and you wanted a great linen window, a carved mantel, a chandelier, fancy flooring, great stairway, like, where did you get that?

23:40.815 --> 23:41.556
At Old Mansions.

23:42.077 --> 23:51.473
And then other people got on the bandwagon and other companies, like Old Bostonian and Restoration Resources, another place that started a business because

23:51.689 --> 24:07.707
you could see that the market was developed already but i found i could say honestly in a big way was one of the the main founders of the business i mean there were other people in it but no one was as big i've never been in anybody's

24:08.176 --> 24:09.918
place that had a place like this.

24:10.058 --> 24:12.520
The average antique shop was a little nothing to me.

24:12.560 --> 24:16.784
Did he ever do research at the Boston Athenaeum or anything like that?

24:16.864 --> 24:17.244
Oh, yeah.

24:17.264 --> 24:19.767
I've been at George Washington's library.

24:19.987 --> 24:20.988
My father knew everybody.

24:21.008 --> 24:23.390
He knew everybody at Harvard.

24:24.231 --> 24:25.552
He knew the curators.

24:25.892 --> 24:27.934
I'd like to send you a copy of my book, by the way.

24:27.994 --> 24:29.776
If you tell me where to send it, send it here.

24:30.237 --> 24:31.438
No, I'll give you an address.

24:31.798 --> 24:35.061
At Harvard, my father knew all the curators and the

24:35.328 --> 24:37.350
and then the higher ups.

24:38.031 --> 24:47.781
One day in the house I found a whole group of 18th century American handwritten plays, like theatrical stuff.

24:47.801 --> 24:51.224
So my father knew the dean at Harvard in charge of that.

24:51.464 --> 24:54.367
And I was dressed in the funkiest work clothes you'd ever seen.

24:54.748 --> 24:58.631
And he sends me, the dean says, oh Mr. Epstein, send your son right over.

24:58.651 --> 25:04.137
So the dean's office was the most elegant Georgian style, and sitting in the

25:04.403 --> 25:06.566
waiting room to see the dean.

25:06.746 --> 25:21.265
We're always up across Harvard students and then I walk in in filthy, dirty clothes with this bag and I sit down and the secretary comes out and says, oh, you people wait, Mr. Ebsen.

25:21.826 --> 25:23.228
It was nice stuff.

25:23.408 --> 25:27.373
Well, just last week I found a whole folio of

25:27.910 --> 25:43.371
letters written in 1660 yeah American but anything American of the 1600s has value no matter what it is no my father's house like there's mountains of uh old

25:43.604 --> 25:44.766
things to go through.

25:44.786 --> 25:49.873
I know he's told somebody, he's meeting about this, so why don't you tell me your phone number and address, and I'll get in touch with you.

25:49.893 --> 25:54.840
My phone number is 296-2637.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.683
That's my mother's number, but I'm always here.

25:56.703 --> 25:57.885
Okay, and then the address is?

25:57.905 --> 25:59.447
487 Norfolk, N-O-R-F-O-L-K.

25:59.547 --> 26:05.095
I think when you see the book, just let me get the zip, okay?

26:05.115 --> 26:06.878
Got a lot of great, rare books, though, I got.

26:07.238 --> 26:08.600
All right, you'll see when I have this.

26:08.620 --> 26:11.985
This is what I write about, by the way, and I want to send you some stuff.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.307
Mattapan, Mass.

26:13.608 --> 26:16.112
and the address 02123.

26:16.192 --> 26:20.778
Oh, I saw him tell Nelson Rockefeller off.

26:21.399 --> 26:23.262
My father has a silver figure.

26:23.282 --> 26:23.983
I got it now.

26:24.403 --> 26:26.606
He thought it was a Donatello or a Cellini.

26:26.887 --> 26:27.548
Really nice.

26:28.449 --> 26:32.535
So we're in New York at a place that deals in that called Michael Hall.

26:32.835 --> 26:34.558
He lived in a Stanford White Mansion.

26:34.618 --> 26:35.820
What a place.

26:35.840 --> 26:41.067
And we're in there and Nelson Rockefeller walks in because he knew Michael Hall.

26:41.427 --> 26:43.210
He was the upper echelon of the

26:43.510 --> 26:44.872
of the fine arts.

26:45.673 --> 26:51.481
So they start looking at the silver figure, and Nelson Rockefeller thought he was God.

26:51.921 --> 26:53.924
What an arrogant guy he was.

26:54.264 --> 27:02.135
And my father takes the figure, this is my figure, takes it back out of his hand, starts telling him off in such a sophisticated, classy way.

27:02.515 --> 27:04.438
You know, you can call somebody

27:04.655 --> 27:12.084
Swear words are just adjectives for someone who's too lazy to think of the correct word to call you.

27:12.885 --> 27:19.734
So my father knew all the correct words, and he was far more knowledgeable than Paul and Rockefeller about the statue.

27:19.754 --> 27:25.762
But I actually saw him tell him off like 20 minutes, and the guy stayed there and listened.

27:25.782 --> 27:29.346
Didn't say, well, bleep you, I'm out of here, because he was

27:29.680 --> 27:37.973
Even Nelson Rockefeller respected knowledge, and my father was— I don't know if he learned everything he learned, but he learned a lot.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.475
One last question.

27:39.495 --> 27:40.878
Did he read with the reader?

27:41.899 --> 27:45.104
Before I leave, I want you to show me the things you're talking about.

27:45.465 --> 27:47.909
The driveway pieces.

27:48.169 --> 27:48.990
You mean the columns?

27:49.030 --> 27:49.331
Yeah.

27:50.112 --> 27:51.975
Oh, there's some iron ones downstairs.

27:52.208 --> 27:55.600
I got a pair of fabulous, unbelievable iron columns on my yard.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.872
Big, like maybe 10 feet tall, and about this big around.

27:58.912 --> 28:01.120
What do they weigh the ones you're talking about?

28:01.140 --> 28:02.404
Oh, you need a crane.
