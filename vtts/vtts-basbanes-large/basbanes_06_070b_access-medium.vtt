WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:04.508
Okay, now we're in.

00:04.688 --> 00:06.911
These are from the states that I settled.

00:06.931 --> 00:12.819
This has got nothing to do with, I have a collection of soap.

00:12.839 --> 00:15.362
I try to find a home for a collection of soap.

00:15.442 --> 00:19.087
Not one of the samples is less than 50 years old.

00:19.327 --> 00:21.270
Now, is this from your business?

00:21.330 --> 00:31.303
Yeah, it's from, these are part of sorting out.

00:32.161 --> 00:33.583
These are duplicates.

00:34.664 --> 00:39.109
You know, here's, I collect Charles Bukowski, who's sort of a beat author.

00:39.610 --> 00:43.234
These are duplicates of... Now, why are you interested in Bukowski?

00:43.394 --> 00:45.076
I like, I read Bukowski.

00:45.116 --> 00:46.978
I like his stuff.

00:47.038 --> 00:54.026
This pile, this is a hern that was done in Cincinnati.

00:54.066 --> 00:57.510
I bought two copies, but I figured, geez, you can't go wrong on this one.

01:02.097 --> 01:02.477
Mm-hmm.

01:03.319 --> 01:04.480
By the Public Library.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.441
1983.

01:05.682 --> 01:06.443
Cincinnati.

01:11.890 --> 01:12.731
First edition.

01:14.293 --> 01:23.104
1983.

01:23.224 --> 01:27.349
That cost, uh, $95.

01:27.470 --> 01:30.113
That's pretty good.

01:31.949 --> 01:33.171
Bird and Bull Press?

01:33.632 --> 01:36.576
Well, no, I've decided I've just got the bird of duplicates.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.458
I think I have it.

01:37.478 --> 01:39.260
That's not a bad idea, actually.

01:39.701 --> 01:42.726
These are Hearn's duplicates.

01:42.786 --> 01:43.667
This is Dubkowski.

01:44.428 --> 01:45.670
I click Norman Douglas.

01:45.690 --> 01:46.592
Those are duplicates.

01:46.632 --> 01:47.954
There's some Moser Press.

01:47.974 --> 01:50.217
There's some Roycroft.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.301
This is Asbury.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.105
That's okay.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.433
These are... Oh, these are Federal Works WPA.

01:59.534 --> 02:07.085
Yeah, this is the Reiner's Project, and I have this pile and this pile and this pile.

02:08.167 --> 02:11.892
I just sold those to a lawyer in Los Angeles for $1,250.

02:12.153 --> 02:17.461
I put them on bathroom scale yesterday, and they weigh 211 pounds.

02:17.661 --> 02:21.687
I'm trying to figure out how to get them to Los Angeles.

02:21.787 --> 02:22.969
But they're interesting.

02:25.352 --> 02:25.733
Okay.

02:26.776 --> 02:30.020
Some of them I haven't even taken out of the packages.

02:30.540 --> 02:31.962
You know, that's 1968.

02:32.222 --> 02:34.785
That's been in a package for 25 years?

02:34.805 --> 02:35.266
Yeah, yeah.

02:35.406 --> 02:35.686
Why?

02:35.926 --> 02:40.812
The inventory of printing, a bibliography edited by D.C.

02:40.832 --> 02:41.493
McMurtry.

02:41.533 --> 02:44.296
McMurtry wrote about... The book book.

02:44.316 --> 02:44.757
Yeah.

02:45.377 --> 02:49.702
A hand list of American publications, 1876-1900.

02:49.822 --> 02:52.746
This is a package that hasn't been opened since 1968.

02:52.766 --> 02:54.648
Oh, listen, I've got something better than that.

02:56.150 --> 02:56.530
So...

02:57.944 --> 03:02.228
Somebody would love to get this, but I just sold it.

03:02.248 --> 03:09.396
These are ship's documents from Newport and Bristol go down.

03:09.476 --> 03:12.279
There's six volumes, and they're a mini-graph.

03:12.299 --> 03:13.820
That's got 800 pages in it.

03:14.441 --> 03:17.624
And they're in perfect condition.

03:17.644 --> 03:19.346
You couldn't find better condition.

03:19.707 --> 03:20.607
How long have you had that?

03:20.908 --> 03:22.529
Oh, I've had it a good long time.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.211
Now, why is it still in its package?

03:24.632 --> 03:25.993
Well, because what do you do with it?

03:26.328 --> 03:27.330
Why did you get it?

03:27.650 --> 03:30.655
Well, because I was collecting WPA stuff, you know.

03:30.675 --> 03:32.238
So it's still part of the collection, then?

03:33.039 --> 03:33.540
Yeah.

03:34.361 --> 03:36.264
Well, here's some more of these documents.

03:37.506 --> 03:42.434
1941, and that book is 51 years old.

03:43.055 --> 03:44.378
Here are four other.

03:44.438 --> 03:46.040
There are six volumes in total.

03:48.524 --> 03:51.930
Let me grant.

03:51.950 --> 03:53.112
You would never...

03:53.193 --> 03:56.037
Where would you find that if you were looking for it?

03:56.057 --> 03:57.439
You tell me, right?

03:58.260 --> 04:03.648
This is great.

04:04.129 --> 04:08.055
Just keep going.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.279
You enjoy this, obviously.

04:11.339 --> 04:12.281
Well, it's fun.

04:12.601 --> 04:13.783
You know, it's a hobby.

04:15.637 --> 04:18.140
Did you ever collect stamps or any other type of a thing?

04:18.480 --> 04:22.264
No, I collected some first editions as a poet.

04:22.304 --> 04:22.845
James Dickey.

04:22.865 --> 04:23.325
James Dickey.

04:23.345 --> 04:26.769
And one day I read one, and I decided I didn't like them.

04:26.789 --> 04:32.154
So I'm going to get rid of those, in case you know anybody who wants to get 20 first editions of James Dickey.

04:33.776 --> 04:35.458
Why did you begin collecting it?

04:36.599 --> 04:39.682
Well, because I'd heard about them, you know, and it's collecting.

04:40.203 --> 04:43.146
The movie Deliverance, you see, that was his novel.

04:44.392 --> 04:55.623
I've heard about them, and I said that my wife collects, I really collect for her.

04:58.186 --> 04:59.327
You saw that downstairs.

04:59.888 --> 05:02.390
Oops, be careful.

05:02.991 --> 05:06.434
Now these, these are Rackham's.

05:06.475 --> 05:07.736
There's a box, everything here.

05:07.776 --> 05:13.842
And they really are, this is in fine condition.

05:24.217 --> 05:25.198
Oh, isn't it gorgeous?

05:29.405 --> 05:30.827
Signed by author Rackham 25.

05:31.047 --> 05:33.851
Number 25 of 50 copies.

05:33.871 --> 05:34.011
Mm-hmm.

05:35.594 --> 05:40.942
And we have a pretty good collection of Rackham knives.

05:42.264 --> 05:46.330
Checking by file cards, I'd say we have a hundred different fragments.

05:46.710 --> 05:47.591
This is one.

05:48.353 --> 05:50.055
Here's another one you can see.

05:52.263 --> 05:54.666
Have you given any thought to what happens to all this?

05:54.947 --> 05:55.448
Yeah, I have.

05:55.468 --> 05:56.729
I'm struggling with that.

05:58.352 --> 05:59.253
And it isn't easy.

06:01.276 --> 06:04.000
There used to be a bookshop called Keswick in New York.

06:04.040 --> 06:04.941
They moved around.

06:05.742 --> 06:10.409
He's now up in a retirement village in Connecticut.

06:10.429 --> 06:13.814
And he and his wife came down here, Herman Cohen, his name is.

06:14.054 --> 06:16.077
I said, Herman, what do I do with these things?

06:16.715 --> 06:23.922
He wrote me a long letter afterwards, and he said, the first thing to do, he says, is to get rid of your duplicates.

06:23.942 --> 06:29.247
And this was such a simple... Immediate solution.

06:29.267 --> 06:30.228
Immediate solution.

06:30.969 --> 06:33.952
But I don't know why I didn't think of it, you know?

06:33.972 --> 06:36.274
These are all duplicate Henry Millers.

06:36.554 --> 06:38.937
Those are, that's junk back there.

06:38.957 --> 06:40.158
These are book oddities.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.781
You know, here's a book in the shape of a fan.

06:44.642 --> 06:46.384
There's a book with a wooden cover.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.322
I don't know what that is.

06:48.342 --> 06:51.126
Oh, yeah, that's interesting.

06:51.146 --> 06:52.008
But it's a duplicate.

06:52.488 --> 06:53.830
I can't get this rebound.

06:53.930 --> 06:54.752
I've tried.

06:55.313 --> 06:56.795
They say they can't press it.

06:58.998 --> 07:00.240
Oh, it's coins.

07:02.384 --> 07:02.524
Yeah.

07:02.544 --> 07:06.089
Look at them.

07:06.109 --> 07:08.373
Now, is any of Blumenthal's stuff up here?

07:08.833 --> 07:10.837
Those are facsimile coins.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.080
A book of facsimile coins.

07:17.448 --> 07:19.130
I wish I knew how to get that.

07:24.315 --> 07:30.562
David Block, who's a dealer, his wife is Chinese.

07:30.722 --> 07:35.107
She's a binder, and she had that for a couple months.

07:35.707 --> 07:36.328
Couldn't do it.

07:36.348 --> 07:37.529
See, there's a duplicate.

07:37.549 --> 07:39.631
Oh, there's the buffalo head, yeah.

07:39.651 --> 07:39.752
Yeah.

07:40.873 --> 07:43.516
This is Henry Miller.

07:44.677 --> 07:45.818
This is Henry Miller.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.043
I don't know.

07:49.063 --> 07:55.793
Now, here is, these are, this is my collection of, or some of it, of Bernhard Wall.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.380
Now, this is the kind of bindings he usually had.

08:00.420 --> 08:04.586
This is why dealers think they're junk, you see.

08:04.606 --> 08:04.786
Mm-hmm.

08:11.837 --> 08:12.177
It's a duplicate.

08:19.835 --> 08:20.917
So how are we selling these?

08:21.497 --> 08:22.479
Through dealers?

08:22.759 --> 08:29.209
Well, I don't know.

08:29.229 --> 08:30.030
There are 200 copies.

08:30.491 --> 08:31.953
But they're interesting.

08:35.338 --> 08:38.803
He's really quite an artist.

08:38.823 --> 08:40.145
...volumes, and they did some things.

08:40.185 --> 08:45.573
This is the third item of the Ashadine Press.

08:45.734 --> 08:45.994
Oh.

08:46.379 --> 08:49.645
which was done for each set of odd volumes, and that's a duplicate.

08:49.665 --> 08:50.506
I have two copies.

08:50.526 --> 08:55.935
So I'm going to sell that, and Boomer's have offered me $500 for that.

08:56.236 --> 08:56.877
That's a good deal.

08:57.157 --> 08:57.879
Yeah, Boomer's good.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.403
Yeah, I paid $1.75 for it.

09:00.583 --> 09:04.350
I'm not telling them that.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.171
That's irrelevant.

09:05.732 --> 09:06.974
Yeah.

09:07.174 --> 09:11.121
Well, you know, if you keep things for 50 years, you...

09:12.890 --> 09:14.952
He did a lot of things on Lincoln.

09:14.972 --> 09:15.653
That's pretty good.

09:15.933 --> 09:16.514
That's nice.

09:20.158 --> 09:21.039
Carl Sandburg.

09:24.543 --> 09:26.224
Juvenile, that is.

09:26.945 --> 09:30.849
Yeah, here's a book, you know.

09:30.869 --> 09:32.531
Like a truck.

09:32.551 --> 09:36.636
Yeah.

09:36.656 --> 09:37.837
A cut book.

09:38.798 --> 09:40.720
So I sort of slowed down on juveniles.

09:41.088 --> 09:45.596
Well, a lot of them aren't, there's so many of them, they're almost not art anymore.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.718
Yeah, yeah.

09:50.745 --> 09:52.127
We moved here in 1950.

09:52.148 --> 09:55.433
You found this, this was a package that was in the attic when you moved here?

09:55.453 --> 09:57.116
No, I found it recently.

09:57.136 --> 10:06.032
I've been sorting out for two years, and as part of the sorting, I found, I found this.

10:14.062 --> 10:21.993
to me in New Jersey, and it's postmarked June 17, 1957.

10:23.435 --> 10:32.948
We moved here in June of 1957, so apparently I brought the package over, and I found it six months ago.

10:32.968 --> 10:36.513
It was still unwrapped.

10:36.893 --> 10:38.736
It sent you from Seattle, Washington.

10:39.117 --> 10:42.381
Yeah, so for 35 years,

10:43.070 --> 10:44.632
That package was unopened.

10:44.772 --> 10:49.398
I opened it, and these are juveniles from the 40s.

10:50.259 --> 10:53.083
And they were brand new, do you think?

10:53.103 --> 10:53.203
Yeah.

10:53.223 --> 10:53.783
Look at that.

10:53.803 --> 10:55.446
They're the book shaped like a train.

10:55.766 --> 11:00.952
These are things that are... Do you remember ordering them?

11:01.793 --> 11:05.318
Well, I must have... When I was out there, I ordered them, I guess.

11:05.338 --> 11:07.921
And the guy sent them to you.

11:07.941 --> 11:10.905
Look, that is... Things get a little mixed up.

11:12.227 --> 11:12.587
So...

11:13.428 --> 11:16.432
That package was unopened for 35 years.

11:16.612 --> 11:17.654
Do you like it?

11:17.674 --> 11:18.394
Is it nice stuff?

11:18.995 --> 11:19.636
Yeah, sort of.

11:19.856 --> 11:22.099
You know, like these are juveniles.

11:22.239 --> 11:31.692
So then I found a package.

11:32.613 --> 11:33.354
I found a letter.

11:33.414 --> 11:37.559
There was a well-known dealer, Delton Americano, the name of Bill Smith.

11:37.660 --> 11:41.865
He was in Cincinnati for years, the Union Central building.

11:42.419 --> 11:45.823
That's where the trolley used to come in.

11:45.843 --> 11:56.015
And he wrote to me, October 5, 1955, we have your letter.

11:57.097 --> 12:01.842
First things that we're shipping you today, Targ's bibliography, and so-and-so.

12:02.463 --> 12:04.325
Asbury, the French Quarter.

12:04.345 --> 12:05.867
It's not first issue.

12:05.887 --> 12:07.108
See, I was collecting Asbury.

12:08.170 --> 12:11.734
We have a crane's worst kind, but it's not fine conditions.

12:13.655 --> 12:24.211
and so-and-so, I will be in business at my home in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, doing a mail order, but he's closed up his shop, you see.

12:25.193 --> 12:32.064
So... At that time, I ordered some things for him, 1955.

12:32.224 --> 12:40.557
And by God, I found them out in the garage recently.

12:45.008 --> 12:47.732
I get a sense that once you acquire the thing, that's the kick.

12:48.754 --> 12:50.036
And then you almost forget about it.

12:50.377 --> 12:52.941
Well, you know, what can you do?

12:53.181 --> 13:01.054
There are 40 items here written by McMurtry.

13:01.074 --> 13:02.797
He wrote about printing subjects.

13:02.817 --> 13:04.519
Douglas McMurtry.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.882
I bought these things.

13:06.983 --> 13:09.868
They've been wrapped up since 1955.

13:12.852 --> 13:14.715
Now, somebody would love to get those.

13:14.735 --> 13:16.757
They have no reason to keep them.

13:16.777 --> 13:17.238
But who?

13:18.500 --> 13:19.661
If I hear anybody, I'll let you know.

13:19.681 --> 13:21.043
They're in perfect condition.

13:22.365 --> 13:29.555
But there's, you can say you've seen a package that's not open for 37 years.

13:30.336 --> 13:30.917
That's great.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.461
I had a grand opening party.

13:33.841 --> 13:35.023
I call it Bob Messman.

13:35.063 --> 13:37.626
He makes miniature books.

13:37.646 --> 13:38.367
No, he opened these.

13:38.387 --> 13:39.689
You have no idea what's in there, right?

13:39.729 --> 13:40.150
No, no.

13:40.190 --> 13:41.712
I had no idea what's in these packages.

13:42.772 --> 13:48.758
I sort of hate to get rid of the rackets.

13:48.778 --> 13:50.820
This is the sorting area that we're in now, right?

13:50.840 --> 13:54.023
Yeah, that newspaper that was in there dated 1957.

13:54.063 --> 13:55.805
From where?

13:56.586 --> 14:02.411
From Seattle, Washington.

14:02.451 --> 14:03.733
Seattle Post-Intelligence.

14:04.373 --> 14:05.614
That ties it all together.

14:12.241 --> 14:12.441
Well,

14:12.792 --> 14:14.294
Let's go look at Mr. Brinstein.

14:14.514 --> 14:18.860
These are some of my... You're teasing me.

14:18.880 --> 14:22.024
These are some of my collection of WPA things.

14:22.225 --> 14:22.886
Oh, that's great.

14:22.906 --> 14:24.207
A whole case.

14:24.227 --> 14:32.959
I bought the two bookcases a couple months ago, and I put them... New York, Panorama, Minnesota, Arrowhead Country.

14:35.482 --> 14:36.444
Yeah.

14:36.464 --> 14:39.989
I did some ephemeral stuff in the county.

14:41.250 --> 14:41.871
There's a...

14:42.509 --> 14:44.011
Here's the Idaho guide.

14:44.071 --> 14:47.234
My state guides are in the attic, which you're welcome to see.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.016
No, this is this way.

14:49.056 --> 14:49.876
This was the first.

14:50.357 --> 14:50.757
Idaho.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.921
And it was done by Vardis Fisher.

14:55.842 --> 14:57.604
And he autographed this.

14:57.624 --> 14:58.465
Isn't that nice?

14:59.466 --> 15:00.987
That's pretty nice.

15:01.008 --> 15:02.509
I paid $7.50 for it.

15:02.529 --> 15:05.993
$7.50 in a dust jacket.

15:06.133 --> 15:09.456
Yeah, how about that?

15:09.476 --> 15:12.499
I just sold a copy for $150.

15:16.613 --> 15:21.740
You're talking about... I bought these as a remainder.

15:22.461 --> 15:23.462
Look at the condition of this.

15:25.765 --> 15:33.555
I found there's an unopened box out in the garage that has 25 copies of this in it.

15:33.575 --> 15:35.077
No, that's Minnesota Arrowhead.

15:36.399 --> 15:39.864
Minnesota Arrowhead Country, American Guide Series.

15:39.904 --> 15:44.770
The Minnesota Arrowhead Country, isn't it?

15:44.790 --> 15:46.232
25 copies.

15:46.955 --> 15:47.636
in the garage.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.397
So why did you buy 25?

15:48.417 --> 15:50.619
Well, because it was a good deal.

15:50.739 --> 15:57.306
I paid a dollar a piece for it.

15:57.326 --> 15:59.849
The Cuddlewood is the Minnesota Arrowhead Country.

16:00.049 --> 16:01.490
No, no Cuddlewood.

16:01.510 --> 16:04.714
Minnesota Arrowhead Country, American Guide Series.

16:06.375 --> 16:12.642
The other bookcase are duplicates that I'm trying to get rid of.

16:17.971 --> 16:19.933
The All-American Guide series.

16:20.534 --> 16:28.322
I saw the... How extensive would you say your collection is of federal writer's project stuff?

16:28.442 --> 16:29.283
How extensive?

16:29.343 --> 16:30.424
Extensive, would you say?

16:30.444 --> 16:32.366
I'll show you my file box on it.

16:36.069 --> 16:42.196
Well, anyhow, I'm going to sell these.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.557
See, most of them are in...

16:45.325 --> 16:46.166
Good condition.

16:46.487 --> 16:48.730
Some of them are not even out of the wrappers.

16:49.211 --> 16:59.286
It's an Ohio Book System.

17:00.368 --> 17:00.728
Yeah.

17:00.748 --> 17:01.149
1954.

17:02.411 --> 17:04.313
They built a city, meaning Cincinnati.

17:04.394 --> 17:05.115
Four copies.

17:05.135 --> 17:06.016
1954.

17:06.196 --> 17:08.059
It's never been opened.

17:08.731 --> 17:13.376
We're talking the bookseller who sent it to you, tied and twined.

17:13.396 --> 17:14.618
Yeah, I bought four copies for them.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.540
Where's the postage on it, out of curiosity?

17:16.580 --> 17:17.481
Twenty-four cents.

17:17.561 --> 17:20.324
Twenty-four cents.

17:20.344 --> 17:22.187
And, you know, they're in fine condition.

17:23.588 --> 17:30.456
Here's a... This is another copy of it that I bought separately.

17:30.476 --> 17:32.639
Let's see.

17:32.659 --> 17:36.443
1958.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.839
You contacted some collectors.

17:40.939 --> 17:49.007
A couple of collectors and proposed that we swap duplicates.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.629
And they both jumped at this.

17:50.789 --> 17:54.493
One was a lawyer from Los Angeles.

17:56.235 --> 17:59.098
I said, what kind of a law firm do you have?

17:59.158 --> 18:04.023
Oh, he says, I've got about 30 lawyers here.

18:04.043 --> 18:06.345
That's the one who arrived in the stretch limousine.

18:06.477 --> 18:08.099
Oh, he came, yeah.

18:08.119 --> 18:12.266
And we swapped until I ran out of things.

18:13.087 --> 18:14.449
Well, he brought stuff with him then.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.470
Yeah.

18:15.490 --> 18:24.163
And then there was a research chemist from the Pfizer drug company by the name of Jin Ye, Chinese.

18:24.183 --> 18:24.704
And he came.

18:25.725 --> 18:26.707
He spent a day here.

18:26.987 --> 18:33.196
He took about 30 items, bought the check for around $1,500, put them all in a knapsack.

18:33.657 --> 18:34.358
Isn't that great?

18:34.709 --> 18:37.252
And again, these were WPA things?

18:37.873 --> 18:38.193
Yeah.

18:38.213 --> 18:40.296
The Chinese guy was interested in WPA things.

18:40.316 --> 18:42.138
Was he American or was he Chinese?

18:42.158 --> 18:43.139
Well, he's Chinese.

18:44.280 --> 18:52.830
But his wife taught at Yale, and he was a research chemist for Pfizer on 42nd Street in New York.

18:53.872 --> 18:58.717
And then she lost her job, and she got another job at, I think it's Reed College in Portland.

18:58.817 --> 19:00.499
So they moved there.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.141
Portland, Maine, or Oregon?

19:02.161 --> 19:02.742
Portland, Oregon.

19:04.342 --> 19:07.866
So he called last evening.

19:07.886 --> 19:09.328
He wanted to come out today.

19:09.348 --> 19:10.709
I said, Jen, I'm sorry.

19:10.729 --> 19:11.570
I'm busy tomorrow.

19:13.312 --> 19:16.416
So apparently he wants to buy all those.

19:16.476 --> 19:16.696
Okay.

19:17.637 --> 19:24.965
So then at the Boston Book Fair last year, I saw a guy buying that book, Central Valley Private Route.

19:25.726 --> 19:26.367
I watched him.

19:27.308 --> 19:32.335
I went up to him afterwards, tapped him on the shoulder, and I said, gee, I saw you find a WPA book.

19:32.375 --> 19:32.996
Do you collect me?

19:33.016 --> 19:33.557
He said, yeah.

19:33.577 --> 19:35.299
Well, I said, I've got a lot of duplicates.

19:36.321 --> 19:41.769
So he came down from Bellows Falls, and he left the check for about $1,500.

19:41.829 --> 19:43.892
He must have been thrilled.

19:44.232 --> 19:44.973
Yeah, he was.

19:45.634 --> 19:51.723
He said, geez, it would take me years to collect these.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.408
I sold a few a couple weeks ago to...

19:56.722 --> 20:04.231
dealer in Whitestone, West Virginia.

20:07.415 --> 20:14.323
So these three piles have been sold to this lawyer from Los Angeles, if I could get them out there.

20:14.783 --> 20:15.544
These are going.

20:15.584 --> 20:17.246
That's part of my collection.

20:17.747 --> 20:18.327
Good for you.

20:18.447 --> 20:19.429
So you're moving it.

20:20.170 --> 20:22.012
Yeah, but it's a slow process.

20:22.072 --> 20:23.794
I've been sorting these for two years.

20:23.814 --> 20:24.935
That gives you something to do, right?

20:24.955 --> 20:25.716
Two years, yeah.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.459
Let's go see the Blumenthal books.

20:34.848 --> 20:43.100
I decided at one point along the line I'd solve the space problem by collecting miniature books, three inches and under in size.

20:43.120 --> 20:48.267
But now I have 3,000, so they've gotten out of hand, and these boxes contain duplicates.

20:48.668 --> 20:49.509
Of miniature books.

20:49.730 --> 20:53.575
Duplicates.

20:53.595 --> 20:53.916
Look at them.

20:53.956 --> 20:54.977
There's a book in there.

20:56.105 --> 20:56.906
This is a miniature.

21:00.290 --> 21:01.171
Let me just open it again.

21:06.798 --> 21:11.544
I have, Nick, I have 3,000 duplicate miniatures.

21:12.165 --> 21:12.365
Wow.

21:12.866 --> 21:14.027
Duplicate.

21:14.228 --> 21:14.708
Duplicate.

21:14.748 --> 21:15.649
These are duplicates.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.031
Well, where do you get all of these?

21:17.051 --> 21:21.056
Different, you know, when you collect, you write and you contact people.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.261
It's hand colored.

21:25.281 --> 21:25.842
That's lovely.

21:28.100 --> 21:32.686
But as you see, they're all in... Great condition.

21:32.706 --> 21:33.487
Nice condition.

21:37.994 --> 21:40.838
All these boxes are full of duplicates.

21:41.298 --> 21:42.199
Miniature books.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.141
Miniature books.

21:45.344 --> 21:47.527
You know, maybe 25 boxes, right?

21:47.547 --> 21:49.189
Yeah, it sounds like they've stopped.

21:51.592 --> 21:53.535
It hasn't even been opened.

21:53.896 --> 21:54.376
That's fine.

21:54.537 --> 21:54.917
That's fine.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.784
Okay, now, let me turn that light on.

21:58.824 --> 22:04.530
There's 58 boxes of bookstuff in the attic, which I've inventory.

22:05.031 --> 22:06.032
That's part of the collection?

22:06.472 --> 22:08.214
No, it's part of miscellaneous stuff.

22:08.234 --> 22:14.661
That's one over the years.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.383
An old bath over the kitchen.

22:16.443 --> 22:20.007
Apparently, years ago, when people had servants, they were servants.

22:20.468 --> 22:23.671
How is this house, 18th century house, would you say?

22:23.731 --> 22:26.254
A central part of it is...

22:27.010 --> 22:29.554
When we moved here, they told us over 200 here.

22:30.215 --> 22:35.462
The living room wing and this kitchen wing are about 60 years old.

22:36.264 --> 22:37.265
So we collect.

22:37.425 --> 22:41.131
Jane, we collected these cookie boards.

22:42.433 --> 22:44.356
And Jane collects irons.

22:44.816 --> 22:47.500
She's got 170 irons.

22:48.482 --> 22:50.244
You get them in the United States from Russia.

22:51.125 --> 22:54.891
I remember buying this in Sri Lanka on New Year's Day.

22:55.377 --> 22:57.099
only tougher than it was seen.

22:57.800 --> 23:03.628
That had the coal set up when we bought it.

23:04.009 --> 23:04.990
This came from India.

23:05.010 --> 23:09.697
This came we found in a, this is Chinese iron muzzle, Chinese irons on hand.

23:09.837 --> 23:11.379
It's like the panel is too long here.

23:12.321 --> 23:15.505
We found that in a temple in Mandalay in Burma.

23:15.645 --> 23:16.046
Wow.

23:16.286 --> 23:20.592
And they were using it for junk, you know, buttons and beads and stuff.

23:24.672 --> 23:26.054
Be prepared for a shot.

23:26.094 --> 23:27.135
See, I'm still working.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.520
These are all my work files, and I ran out of space.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.982
Oh, we're going upstairs.

23:32.002 --> 23:36.067
Yeah, we're going upstairs.

23:36.087 --> 23:38.070
Ah, this is unbelievable.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.494
This is unbelievable.

23:43.077 --> 23:44.579
This is an old bathroom, right?

23:44.599 --> 23:44.879
Yeah.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.681
Oh, my God.

23:46.882 --> 23:49.125
My wife has been drowning in squirrels there.

23:49.165 --> 23:52.950
She catches them and drowns them in there.

23:52.970 --> 23:53.110
This is

23:54.608 --> 23:58.572
So I find myself at Goodspeed's bookstore.

23:59.714 --> 24:02.236
They issued a publication for years called The Month.

24:02.256 --> 24:03.518
They send it every month.

24:03.578 --> 24:09.604
So I'm trying to complete a set of them.

24:09.744 --> 24:14.590
They were really interesting little booklets in December of 35.

24:15.731 --> 24:17.953
So what's that got to do with the other stuff I clicked?

24:17.973 --> 24:21.257
Well, it's The Chase.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.822
This place is unbelievable.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.925
Now, is this where your main collection is, up here?

24:31.826 --> 24:39.197
Well, it depends what you're looking at.

24:39.217 --> 24:40.759
The book out of these, are they up here, too?

24:40.899 --> 24:41.640
Yeah, they're up here.

24:42.521 --> 24:43.783
Let me just step in here.

24:43.803 --> 24:45.746
This is unbelievable.

24:47.609 --> 24:50.793
I've got to get a picture of you in this room.

24:50.813 --> 24:52.155
Just I'm going to stand out here.

24:55.898 --> 25:01.826
This is great.

25:01.846 --> 25:03.308
Great, okay.

25:03.328 --> 25:07.795
These are, these are Roycroft.

25:08.916 --> 25:12.561
These bottom three shelves are Charles Bukowski.

25:12.582 --> 25:16.727
There's a lot of the ephemeral stuff there, you know, magazines and such.

25:17.989 --> 25:23.577
I click Joseph Ferguson, nobody else does, but here are these two shelves.

25:23.928 --> 25:25.670
Joseph Ferguson.

25:27.152 --> 25:30.737
And you notice they're all in pretty nice condition.

25:30.757 --> 25:32.279
These are in the glass bookcase.

25:32.439 --> 25:34.642
Joseph Ferguson.

25:34.662 --> 25:35.342
I don't know of this.

25:35.363 --> 25:36.063
I'm going to write it down.

25:36.324 --> 25:36.404
H?

25:37.005 --> 25:39.147
H-E-R-G-E-S.

25:39.588 --> 25:40.930
H-E-I-M-E-R.

25:41.010 --> 25:41.831
H-E-R-G-E-S.

25:42.051 --> 25:42.632
And who is he?

25:42.652 --> 25:43.393
Is he an American?

25:43.573 --> 25:44.354
Yeah, he's an American.

25:44.394 --> 25:45.656
Look down around Philadelphia.

25:45.696 --> 25:46.216
Was he good?

25:46.897 --> 25:49.400
Well, he was, he had his day.

25:50.021 --> 25:52.184
I don't think many people collect him now.

25:52.204 --> 25:53.125
Why did he collect him?

25:53.273 --> 25:54.414
Well, it's a challenge.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.418
I was trying to complete Pergussheimer.

25:57.518 --> 25:58.058
Did you do it?

25:58.659 --> 25:59.840
No, not yet.

25:59.860 --> 26:00.581
How many are there?

26:01.022 --> 26:02.704
Well, I had maybe three or four to go.

26:03.384 --> 26:04.005
Out of how many?

26:05.247 --> 26:05.927
Well, here they are.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.089
One, two shelves.

26:09.572 --> 26:10.833
I don't know, maybe 50.

26:11.894 --> 26:12.635
Pergussheimer.

26:13.796 --> 26:14.958
Here's some more of those rivers.

26:16.780 --> 26:17.801
I don't even know what's up there.

26:17.901 --> 26:23.247
The Yukon, the Niagara, the Cape Fear, the Susquehanna, the Merrimack.

26:23.564 --> 26:28.251
I was a friend of the name of Kurt Volk who turned out some of his hobbies and things.

26:28.371 --> 26:31.135
I'm collecting Kurt Volk.

26:33.579 --> 26:35.582
He did some interesting things.

26:39.768 --> 26:41.110
He calls his snowflake.

26:42.752 --> 26:45.937
Please don't put my house in your book.

26:45.957 --> 26:46.578
This is wonderful.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.662
How's beautiful, Jane?

26:50.223 --> 26:50.944
This is wonderful.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.086
It's wonderful.

26:53.332 --> 26:55.214
It feels like home.

26:55.234 --> 27:01.783
You see, some people might... This is Snowflake by Jeremy, S-T-R-O-P, Jeremy.

27:02.984 --> 27:04.747
And, you know, it's such a fragile thing.

27:04.767 --> 27:06.088
It's just self-binding.

27:09.152 --> 27:11.816
Well, we'll be through here in a minute.

27:11.836 --> 27:16.061
We'll be through.

27:16.161 --> 27:17.243
Now I can't stop.

27:18.524 --> 27:22.950
We're not late.

27:23.302 --> 27:26.426
He'll go on talking this way.

27:26.446 --> 27:28.309
He gets wound up.

27:28.329 --> 27:34.237
Now, these are books written by Walter Hart Blumenthal.

27:34.317 --> 27:35.178
He wrote a lot of them.

27:35.198 --> 27:40.806
I've been collecting not only oddities, but the things he... Well, that makes sense.

27:40.826 --> 27:41.747
He wrote, you see.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.970
He's a pretty good writer, by the way.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.593
Yeah, Benjamin Franklin.

27:45.613 --> 27:50.539
His comment on his wit and wisdom.

27:50.559 --> 27:52.482
Oddities are in stride for me.

27:58.351 --> 28:03.097
This is from Blumenfeld to Starrett.

28:03.798 --> 28:09.225
My friend, I pray you read this script with open mind and then give it your gravamen.

28:09.806 --> 28:16.895
It's true that cultist critics quipped and so on.

28:16.915 --> 28:18.898
He called himself Hart, H-A-R-T.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.180
Yeah.

28:21.501 --> 28:24.064
Oh, there it is.

28:24.104 --> 28:27.008
He published this when he had a bookstore, Hart Book Company.

28:27.477 --> 28:29.079
1775 Broadway.

28:29.139 --> 28:31.983
That's just a little north of the Columbus Circle.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.807
And where would you find those today?

28:35.989 --> 28:36.750
Where did you find them?

28:37.271 --> 28:39.233
Well, a friend of mine had them, and he gave them to me.

28:39.253 --> 28:39.674
That's great.

28:39.694 --> 28:40.575
I swapped things.

28:40.595 --> 28:47.825
But there are a lot of... There are a lot of... These are all... I think they're all Blooming Falls.

28:52.191 --> 28:55.035
No, that's a guy by the name of Count Patalki.

28:55.055 --> 28:55.776
I picked him.

28:56.197 --> 28:56.978
He's a Polish.

28:57.245 --> 28:59.408
He pretends to be a... Count?

28:59.428 --> 28:59.808
Count.

28:59.828 --> 29:05.796
He pretends to be the heir that's... The heir that was fallen in Poland.

29:05.876 --> 29:06.497
Is he alive?

29:08.439 --> 29:09.020
Is he alive?

29:09.040 --> 29:09.380
No, he is.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.942
Yeah, he lives in France.

29:10.962 --> 29:12.124
Count Batolki.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.285
Yeah.

29:13.305 --> 29:15.348
I collect Henry Miller first editions.

29:15.368 --> 29:19.232
These are... This whole bookcase is Henry Miller.

29:23.037 --> 29:24.319
He's tucked in the corner.

29:24.940 --> 29:25.260
Yeah.

29:25.966 --> 29:39.843
This, I collect the Maverick Press, which, let me see if I can... Oh, let's see, I've run out of space.

29:39.863 --> 29:41.986
Maverick Press did some interesting things.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.709
Let me see if I can get there.

29:46.572 --> 29:50.857
Oh, here, so here's a... You made any trip?

29:51.377 --> 29:51.838
Yeah.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.962
Do you have any idea roughly how many items you have in the house?

29:54.982 --> 29:55.703
50,000?

29:55.723 --> 30:07.454
No, I think about, I think, not counting duplicates, maybe 15,000, judging by file cards.

30:07.514 --> 30:11.157
Here's a, this is done by Bruce Rogers.

30:11.677 --> 30:12.378
Oh, that's gorgeous.

30:14.039 --> 30:18.223
BR, Bruce Rogers' Bible story.

30:18.243 --> 30:20.065
It's a scroll.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.467
Oh, and it's a miniature.

30:22.632 --> 30:23.733
Yeah.

30:23.753 --> 30:24.254
It's beautiful.

30:24.354 --> 30:30.160
But I collected that as part of... But you keep it in a manila folder.

30:31.021 --> 30:34.224
Well, see, I've never had time.

30:35.565 --> 30:37.307
Little Orphan Ampersand.

30:39.009 --> 30:40.410
Little Orphan Ampersand.

30:40.671 --> 30:40.851
Yeah.

30:41.492 --> 30:43.133
And that's what we saw on the sandpaper, right?

30:43.414 --> 30:46.897
Yeah, these are ephemeral things that they did.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.542
Feet are like the cards announcing the sale they're on, I guess.

30:52.130 --> 30:52.731
Those are nice.

30:55.714 --> 30:56.996
Speaking of Gowdy.

30:57.016 --> 30:59.599
And the Philip Duchenne manila envelope.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.805
Yeah, well, I got a lot of these from them.

31:06.448 --> 31:13.917
I'll put that back, so someday I can find it again.

31:13.937 --> 31:15.239
Norman Douglas.

31:15.259 --> 31:17.942
One, two, three shells.

31:19.704 --> 31:20.145
And, uh,

31:21.357 --> 31:24.822
This is probably the nicest portion I have.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.606
A lot of this stuff is ephemeral.

31:29.288 --> 31:33.494
I don't know where you'd find some of this today.

31:33.514 --> 31:41.025
It's hard to keep them.

31:41.185 --> 31:42.367
That's not going to come.

31:42.487 --> 31:42.988
That's okay.

31:43.008 --> 31:48.175
The kind of stuff that's here, you know, here is... Did you see your fist right here?

31:48.982 --> 31:50.044
Is it an obsession?

31:50.104 --> 31:51.926
No, I don't know.

31:52.167 --> 31:53.008
It's under control.

31:53.048 --> 31:54.170
I do other things.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.171
I'm still working.

31:56.934 --> 31:58.616
You've never overspent for anything?

32:00.179 --> 32:03.564
I mean, overspent to the point where... I've never borrowed money to do it.

32:03.964 --> 32:11.716
That's important, yeah.

32:11.976 --> 32:15.922
Herpetology of the Grand... By Herman Douglas.

32:15.942 --> 32:16.002
Oh.

32:18.226 --> 32:19.368
He was quite a character.

32:19.388 --> 32:24.354
I think this would have a home in a university collection someplace, I'll bet.

32:24.394 --> 32:26.537
Yeah, probably.

32:26.557 --> 32:29.081
He used the pseudonym first.

32:29.101 --> 32:31.143
I know our M-Y-X.

32:31.164 --> 32:32.525
Right.

32:32.545 --> 32:33.447
Normix.

32:35.029 --> 32:36.110
Isn't that great?

32:36.130 --> 32:39.755
These are Book Club of California, Groyer.

32:40.716 --> 32:43.040
All in their packages, as they were mailed to.

32:44.742 --> 32:45.583
Bull and Bear.

32:46.812 --> 32:48.254
And Lord knows what else.

32:48.354 --> 33:00.051
Alembic Press, Allen Press.

33:00.071 --> 33:09.044
This case was published by a letter written to her by a prime minister of England.

33:09.405 --> 33:12.870
And here it is, you know, 10 Downing Street.

33:14.268 --> 33:15.089
Mrs. Webb.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.191
And you've got the letter.

33:16.511 --> 33:17.292
I've got the letter.

33:23.021 --> 33:23.662
Why don't you read it?

33:24.123 --> 33:29.190
Dear Mrs. Webb, I hope you will not think it an impertinence.

33:31.854 --> 33:38.865
On my part, if I tell you with what keen delight I have read Precious Fame.

33:39.285 --> 33:42.570
That was her most famous book, and I have the dedication copy of that.

33:43.850 --> 33:59.112
My people lived in Shropshire for centuries before they immigrated to Worcestershire, and I spent my earliest years in Beardsley, which is on the border.

33:59.593 --> 34:08.466
In your book, I seem to hear again the speech and turn of phrase which surrounded me in the nursery.

34:09.487 --> 34:12.692
I think it is a really first-class piece of work

34:13.229 --> 34:16.194
and I have not enjoyed a book so much for years.

34:16.935 --> 34:25.450
It was given to me by one of my secretaries, and I read it at Christmas within sight of the Clare Hills at home.

34:25.751 --> 34:27.534
Thank you a thousand times for it.

34:28.255 --> 34:31.921
Believe me, to remain sincerely your Stanley Baldwin.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.905
Now, that's a nice letter to have.

34:33.925 --> 34:35.768
Where did you find that?

34:35.828 --> 34:36.469
I bought it.

34:36.489 --> 34:37.151
From a dealer.

34:37.171 --> 34:37.431
Yeah.

34:37.985 --> 34:39.347
Were you collecting Mary Webb?

34:39.547 --> 34:41.350
Now, how did you say that you said that made her famous?

34:41.370 --> 34:41.730
What happened?

34:41.750 --> 34:42.451
Was that published?

34:42.732 --> 34:43.873
Yeah, it was published, yeah.

34:44.133 --> 34:45.295
So that made her famous, right?

34:45.315 --> 34:48.820
These are manuscripts of her poems, and I have some of her short stories.

34:50.122 --> 34:56.631
And I had this case made, but shortly, when we're having lunch, I'll tell you.

34:56.671 --> 34:58.874
Remind me of Mary Webb, and I'll tell you the story.

34:58.914 --> 35:01.878
Here's a letter from David Randall.

35:01.958 --> 35:02.739
David Randall, yep.

35:02.839 --> 35:04.361
He's duped in large enough books.

35:04.502 --> 35:04.802
Yeah.

35:05.255 --> 35:06.657
How did you get on, Mary Webb?

35:06.957 --> 35:09.160
Well, I don't know.

35:09.500 --> 35:14.286
I don't know how I get started on things.

35:14.306 --> 35:14.406
Okay.

35:14.426 --> 35:15.127
We're in the book.

35:16.088 --> 35:17.850
What this room is, this is the book audit, isn't it?

35:17.870 --> 35:18.030
Yeah.

35:18.511 --> 35:18.972
I don't know.

35:19.312 --> 35:20.694
Well, yes and no.

35:21.515 --> 35:23.477
These are most of us.

35:23.497 --> 35:23.797
Look at them.

35:24.698 --> 35:25.740
All first editions.

35:26.901 --> 35:27.982
All in fine condition.

35:29.724 --> 35:30.706
Where do you keep them?

35:30.866 --> 35:31.987
I was glad to be able to get that.

35:32.007 --> 35:32.908
That's a nice closet.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.350
Box in there, you know.

35:36.592 --> 35:51.148
Oh, it might come around here.

35:51.168 --> 35:52.369
I've got to show you.

35:53.391 --> 35:54.211
Miniature books.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.837
Jesus.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.078
This is a bureau now.

36:00.518 --> 36:01.319
Oh, my God.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.423
It's full of miniatures.

36:04.443 --> 36:05.504
Thousands, right?

36:06.465 --> 36:06.565
Yeah.

36:07.085 --> 36:11.391
Three drawers, three giant drawers filled with miniature books.

36:13.454 --> 36:13.915
Look at them.

36:14.436 --> 36:15.297
That's very interesting.

36:15.317 --> 36:17.881
You know, it's just done by a little girl.

36:20.024 --> 36:23.389
And it's in her.

36:23.890 --> 36:24.651
She wrote it, yeah.

36:24.971 --> 36:25.893
The Pretty Rocks.

36:28.096 --> 36:28.777
Yeah.

36:28.797 --> 36:32.302
Here's a book called Haunted Pajamas.

36:32.422 --> 36:36.248
It's in bounden pajama cloth.

36:36.430 --> 36:44.003
Here's a book found in Horsod, Argentina.

36:45.144 --> 36:46.306
Oh, this is the yard stuff.

36:46.767 --> 36:49.251
Yeah.

36:49.271 --> 36:57.004
There's a scroll from Lake Tana in Ethiopia.

37:07.801 --> 37:12.786
What kind of skin?

37:13.667 --> 37:24.818
Well, I mean, with this collection, you could be anything.

37:24.838 --> 37:26.880
Can you get that?

37:27.161 --> 37:28.142
I'm sorry.

37:28.402 --> 37:31.705
See, if I figure I'll put that away later, then I don't do it.

37:33.107 --> 37:34.348
So these are the oddities.

37:34.615 --> 37:37.139
Well, this whole room is filled with oddities.

37:37.159 --> 37:37.920
Any favorites?

37:38.901 --> 37:41.525
No.

37:41.545 --> 37:42.266
No, not really.

37:42.667 --> 37:46.332
Did you have a book that was like 5 or 10 feet tall or something like that?

37:46.392 --> 37:49.156
No, I don't have that.

37:49.176 --> 37:50.198
This as well, is it?

37:58.390 --> 38:00.493
What was that?

38:00.513 --> 38:01.935
Well, I guess this is a binding.

38:02.075 --> 38:03.998
It's an embroidered binding.

38:06.037 --> 38:07.779
Jane gave that to me as a Christmas present.

38:07.799 --> 38:08.199
You're right, right?

38:08.379 --> 38:19.330
It's hard to find some brighter bindings in perfect condition, OK?

38:19.350 --> 38:20.632
Hmm.

38:21.192 --> 38:23.515
I found that in a cello-alto.

38:23.535 --> 38:23.695
Binding?

38:23.715 --> 38:24.035
Ivory?

38:24.055 --> 38:24.215
Ivory.

38:25.977 --> 38:26.878
There's a mock book.

38:27.579 --> 38:28.620
What do you call it?

38:28.640 --> 38:29.721
A mock book.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.723
It looks like a book, but it isn't a book.

38:32.750 --> 38:33.711
But it's still loaded.

38:35.033 --> 38:35.954
Well, it's got booze in it.

38:35.974 --> 38:38.458
It's got booze in it.

38:38.478 --> 38:39.759
Mark M.O.C.K., Mark.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.662
It's got all kinds of mock books.

38:42.483 --> 38:42.984
Here's one.

38:45.267 --> 38:49.152
Birthday, present, age nine years by Frank, you know.

38:51.195 --> 38:53.939
Here's another one.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.582
Got that in India by the Taj Mahal.

38:56.622 --> 38:58.965
That's like the decoration on the Taj Mahal.

39:00.728 --> 39:02.470
Here's a finger book.

39:04.762 --> 39:05.363
Meaning what?

39:05.383 --> 39:05.744
What is it?

39:05.764 --> 39:07.066
Well, the shape of the finger.

39:08.208 --> 39:09.129
Can I see it?

39:09.149 --> 39:09.249
Yeah.

39:09.269 --> 39:10.291
Is there a finger in it?

39:10.311 --> 39:10.712
No, no.

39:10.752 --> 39:13.516
It's just the shape of it, like a finger.

39:13.536 --> 39:14.257
Oh, I see.

39:14.397 --> 39:14.778
OK.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.060
And it's printed.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.063
I got it because it's printed sideways.

39:18.083 --> 39:18.704
Oh, I get it.

39:18.825 --> 39:19.245
OK.

39:21.108 --> 39:22.831
It's long, but it's printed sideways.

39:26.858 --> 39:27.458
Yeah.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.545
This is a mock book.

39:33.365 --> 39:34.287
History of the War.

39:34.607 --> 39:36.210
It's a checkerboard.

39:38.173 --> 39:40.658
I've never seen one with a carrying.

39:40.698 --> 39:42.100
No, that's a book?

39:42.120 --> 39:42.441
Yeah.

39:42.461 --> 39:43.563
Oh, it's a mock book.

39:44.164 --> 39:44.925
Oh, it's not a real book.

39:45.246 --> 39:45.366
Okay.

39:45.446 --> 39:47.830
No, it's a mock book.

39:47.850 --> 39:51.377
Like this, you know, this is a bank.

39:53.601 --> 39:56.706
Somebody just gave that to me, a dealer in Los Angeles.

40:02.103 --> 40:03.485
We saw that one.

40:03.505 --> 40:04.165
That's the one you got.

40:04.305 --> 40:05.467
You got one of those from Seattle.

40:06.288 --> 40:07.629
That's one of the ones that was in that.

40:07.669 --> 40:09.191
Not the same one, though.

40:09.211 --> 40:09.812
It looked like it.

40:10.312 --> 40:13.055
Well, maybe it is.

40:13.075 --> 40:14.537
That book is picked like a train.

40:15.839 --> 40:19.403
There's one in, that looks like books in Rawhide up there.

40:20.404 --> 40:24.088
They're looking in the package.

40:24.108 --> 40:24.769
Right here on top.

40:25.149 --> 40:28.493
It has animal voices.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.975
Wait, is it ever anything printed in it?

40:30.035 --> 40:30.355
No.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.712
I don't remember.

40:33.732 --> 40:33.792
No.

40:33.812 --> 40:35.595
It's on top of this giant cage.

40:35.615 --> 40:38.799
Of course, there are books.

40:39.180 --> 40:44.808
This is by Lynn Ward, the woodcutter, and it has no text.

40:44.969 --> 40:47.412
No text.

40:47.432 --> 40:48.454
It's titled Vertigo.

40:49.415 --> 40:57.287
Yeah, he did three or four of them.

40:59.765 --> 41:01.167
There's a book on palm leaves.

41:01.227 --> 41:05.974
There's a mock book that's a flask.

41:10.560 --> 41:18.592
Look at the odd paper in this one.

41:18.612 --> 41:19.192
Yeah, that's great.

41:19.212 --> 41:20.314
Okay, this is great.

41:20.634 --> 41:21.516
Here's a round book.

41:23.759 --> 41:26.142
Let me take a picture of that.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.185
Let's see what we can get on it.

41:31.979 --> 41:32.940
These are all other things.

41:33.341 --> 41:34.783
But I haven't got them organized.

41:34.823 --> 41:38.128
I ought to get different things together, you know.

41:38.148 --> 41:39.511
I never had time to do it.

41:41.253 --> 41:47.062
You could probably, at some point, if you wanted Delphes as a collection, the way you got Blumenthal's collection.

41:47.082 --> 41:50.888
Well, Yale had an exhibit a couple years ago.

41:50.908 --> 41:56.076
I went up to see it, and I put some of mine in a briefcase and took them in right away.

41:56.116 --> 41:57.478
They really didn't have much.

41:58.199 --> 42:00.062
Most of them are modern pop-ups.

42:00.802 --> 42:01.503
That's it.

42:01.523 --> 42:02.424
The Beinecke did this?

42:03.025 --> 42:03.706
Yeah.

42:03.726 --> 42:04.908
The Stirling Library.

42:04.928 --> 42:05.168
Yeah.

42:06.851 --> 42:07.832
The Stirling Library did it.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.855
Yeah.

42:09.875 --> 42:13.421
And... Billy Walker was the curator.

42:13.521 --> 42:14.001
...down here.

42:15.003 --> 42:16.265
She issued a catalog.

42:16.986 --> 42:18.027
What does she have?

42:18.047 --> 42:19.289
Do you have an extra copy of that?

42:19.329 --> 42:22.133
No, she called an extra... A little bag of graffiti.

42:22.153 --> 42:23.535
All sorts of things in here.

42:25.719 --> 42:26.640
I think this is great.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.507
Well, you know, you're welcome to look at anything.

42:29.607 --> 42:32.510
No, I think I've got plenty of material to tell you.

42:32.530 --> 42:38.236
These are all hogs.

42:38.276 --> 42:48.506
There are bindings, there's colored paper, there's... The auto-guest book.

42:49.107 --> 42:50.768
This is from the 20s, you know.

42:50.989 --> 42:53.891
People go on a trip.

42:53.911 --> 42:55.513
Have I ever seen upside-down books?

42:55.831 --> 42:57.673
Say It With Bricks, Say It With Oil.

42:58.253 --> 43:01.216
Okay, Say It With Bricks by Nina Wilcox.

43:01.737 --> 43:02.337
Putnam.

43:02.357 --> 43:02.958
On one side.

43:03.078 --> 43:04.759
Upside Down, Say It With Oil.

43:05.160 --> 43:05.981
By who?

43:06.001 --> 43:06.601
Ring Lardner.

43:06.681 --> 43:08.363
By Ring Lardner.

43:08.383 --> 43:11.186
I have a dozen upside down books.

43:11.206 --> 43:12.947
I set up some books in the living room.

43:12.967 --> 43:15.490
What exactly is an upside down book?

43:16.170 --> 43:18.633
You can read it this way or upside down.

43:18.953 --> 43:20.094
But it's two different stories.

43:20.134 --> 43:20.554
Yeah.

43:20.935 --> 43:23.357
Yeah.

43:23.590 --> 43:32.980
Would you like to see your collection of oddities set together after you're ready to part with it?

43:33.241 --> 43:35.123
I really don't care.

43:35.543 --> 43:37.886
No, I don't.

43:37.906 --> 43:44.553
I let people say, well, we'll issue a catalog of Fred J. Ford's collection of book oddities.

43:44.733 --> 43:47.556
I don't need it.

43:48.317 --> 43:49.098
Nice, though.

43:49.258 --> 43:52.602
That's what Jeremy Norman did for his father.

43:53.020 --> 43:53.901
That was his gift.

43:53.921 --> 43:58.667
He did a $600 catalog of his father's library.

43:59.268 --> 44:00.689
It took him eight years to do it.

44:00.709 --> 44:01.490
It's just out now.

44:02.512 --> 44:04.354
And now his father said the same thing.

44:04.374 --> 44:08.118
Well, it doesn't really matter to me what happens to it now that I've got the camera.

44:10.261 --> 44:13.385
That doesn't really bother you one way or another.

44:13.405 --> 44:15.047
No, not really.

44:18.491 --> 44:18.831
Okay.

44:19.072 --> 44:20.113
We're among your oddities.

44:21.695 --> 44:22.656
Well, here are...

44:23.851 --> 44:24.712
Some oddities.

44:24.832 --> 44:25.594
Here's a book.

44:26.635 --> 44:30.221
The pictures are all made on a typewriter.

44:34.267 --> 44:34.847
Here's a book.

44:37.271 --> 44:40.195
A Japanese book with a doll attached to the front cover.

44:40.276 --> 44:41.638
To me, it's a strange binding.

44:42.138 --> 44:43.741
I searched for years to find that.

44:44.422 --> 44:47.246
And a week later, I found another title for the doll.

44:47.266 --> 44:48.388
What did you search the year for?

44:48.428 --> 44:49.089
You knew it existed?

44:49.109 --> 44:52.414
Yeah, I knew it existed.

44:52.434 --> 44:53.335
This is a...

44:55.306 --> 44:59.070
panorama of the Thames River.

44:59.291 --> 44:59.951
That's beautiful.

45:00.332 --> 45:00.692
That's nice.

45:00.732 --> 45:02.554
Sixty feet long, hand color.

45:02.594 --> 45:03.495
Sixty feet.

45:03.696 --> 45:06.599
Yeah, it's perfect, perfect condition.

45:06.619 --> 45:07.480
And how old is this?

45:07.920 --> 45:09.422
This looks like it's been around for a while.

45:09.762 --> 45:11.805
Yeah, I don't, I don't really recall.

45:11.825 --> 45:13.747
I'm just looking for a date.

45:14.988 --> 45:17.751
Price 18 shillings, so that's back a little way.

45:19.153 --> 45:21.356
Mm-hmm.

45:21.376 --> 45:22.697
There's an unusual binding.

45:24.010 --> 45:24.951
It's bolded together.

45:24.991 --> 45:26.753
Literally bolded together.

45:28.435 --> 45:29.035
Persona.

45:29.156 --> 45:30.697
P-E-R-S-O-N-A.

45:31.658 --> 45:34.241
This book I got from Scotland.

45:34.742 --> 45:37.044
Bold and Rare Scottish Tartans.

45:37.244 --> 45:37.845
T-A-R-T-A-N-S.

45:38.005 --> 45:38.766
Tartans in it.

45:38.786 --> 45:39.887
The actual tartans.

45:39.907 --> 45:40.528
That's wool.

45:41.589 --> 45:44.072
Every time I open this, I hope I don't see moths.

45:46.775 --> 45:48.737
This is very hard to find.

45:50.018 --> 45:52.701
But they're all there.

45:53.744 --> 45:55.066
Look how beautifully it's printed.

45:55.366 --> 45:57.569
You know, I wish this was a functional book.

45:57.809 --> 46:06.300
I wish this was a book used by, you know... It came from Edinburgh, 1980.

46:08.704 --> 46:11.027
Here's a minute your book is shaped like a broom.

46:16.234 --> 46:16.694
Okay.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.722
This is what they call...

46:24.524 --> 46:25.905
a letter press.

46:26.646 --> 46:28.828
I've never seen another one or heard of one.

46:29.869 --> 46:35.535
Before they had carbon paper, they used to make copies of letters this way.

46:35.575 --> 46:38.738
This is sort of porous paper.

46:39.919 --> 46:40.840
They would dampen it.

46:40.860 --> 46:48.527
They would put the letter that they'd written face down on it, and then they'd lock it shut.

46:50.389 --> 46:50.989
That's amazing.

46:51.049 --> 46:51.730
What do you call it?

46:52.047 --> 46:57.634
It's a letterpress, and you could read it from the other side, you see.

46:58.595 --> 47:00.237
I've never, never heard of one.

47:00.297 --> 47:03.481
Well, it would make a negative image, so it would have to come through on the other side.

47:03.501 --> 47:03.961
I'll get it here.

47:05.784 --> 47:06.645
It came from England.

47:12.091 --> 47:12.772
Beautiful.

47:12.792 --> 47:13.893
How old would you say that is?

47:13.913 --> 47:21.322
It's got to be around, certainly before the invention of carbon paper, it's got to be... 1855.

47:21.823 --> 47:22.003
Mm-hmm.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.918
And what is he called?

47:26.198 --> 47:27.340
No, that's another book.

47:27.360 --> 47:30.884
S. Moderns and Company Patent Portable Copying Press.

47:31.965 --> 47:40.074
A povo-sized book of 400 numbered flimsy pages for receiving copies of letters with two separate pages of thick-wheeled paper.

47:40.254 --> 47:44.099
Around 1850.

47:44.399 --> 47:46.041
That's kind of nice.

47:46.101 --> 47:46.902
I love that.

47:47.002 --> 47:47.923
As a matter of fact.

47:50.232 --> 48:02.250
Here is one of the rag books, you know, that's for children, just undestructible, but this is dated, I think, 19... That's called Goosey Books, G-O-S-I-E.

48:02.270 --> 48:02.871
1907.

48:03.071 --> 48:05.054
The color's pretty good.

48:05.074 --> 48:08.820
What fine condition that is for a book that's... Look at the color, huh?

48:08.840 --> 48:09.901
...that age, you know?

48:09.921 --> 48:10.122
Sure.

48:10.462 --> 48:12.305
Most of them are all... 85 years old?

48:13.527 --> 48:14.268
Yeah.

48:14.288 --> 48:14.368
87.

48:15.149 --> 48:17.633
Here's a book that I got because of the binding.

48:17.733 --> 48:19.075
It's a corrugated board.

48:19.831 --> 48:22.255
Imagine binding a book in a corrugated board.

48:22.395 --> 48:23.096
Like cardboard?

48:23.257 --> 48:23.938
Yeah, cardboard.

48:23.998 --> 48:25.420
Like a case.

48:26.122 --> 48:26.322
Right.

48:26.342 --> 48:26.923
And a title of it.

48:27.484 --> 48:28.506
I don't know what this is.

48:28.626 --> 48:30.088
I have several books by him.

48:31.150 --> 48:36.719
He must have been sort of erratic or aberrant.

48:37.340 --> 48:39.744
The Song of Songs, which is Sullivan's.

48:39.845 --> 48:41.447
There's one line on each page.

48:41.788 --> 48:43.350
One line on each page.

48:45.254 --> 48:46.075
For instance...

48:46.730 --> 48:50.114
How art thou fair, karma, my love?

48:50.274 --> 48:51.476
That's line 137.

48:52.978 --> 48:56.442
Okay.

48:56.462 --> 49:00.888
And he has these strange designs.

49:01.428 --> 49:08.377
Now, look, he has written, that's handwritten, copyright, R-I-G-T, 1964.

49:08.437 --> 49:08.717
04.

49:08.737 --> 49:11.341
04, I'm sorry.

49:11.361 --> 49:15.606
And he signed it, but he's written in copyright, R-I-G-T.

49:17.020 --> 49:19.123
I have another one by him someplace.

49:19.143 --> 49:25.190
This was done by the Baileys, the dealers out in... Oh, no, this is another one.

49:25.210 --> 49:26.451
It's a tête-à-tête book.

49:28.234 --> 49:33.480
This is not an upside-down book, but you put it on a table between two people.

49:33.780 --> 49:39.467
So I work here, and you work there, so you can solve the...

49:40.088 --> 49:44.893
So we can face each other and there are pages on the opposite sides.

49:44.913 --> 49:46.815
I've never seen another one like that.

49:46.836 --> 49:52.442
See, somebody has done a little... Tete-a-tete, so we can go head-to-head.

49:52.462 --> 49:52.842
Tete-a-tete, yeah.

49:52.862 --> 49:53.062
Oddity?

49:53.082 --> 49:53.363
That's cute.

49:55.085 --> 49:56.246
Do you agree these are oddity?

49:56.266 --> 49:58.669
The Tete-a-tete book by Lassiter Wren.

50:01.111 --> 50:06.297
This is a correction on purple paper.

50:08.219 --> 50:08.880
This has got...

50:10.092 --> 50:12.014
colored paper on it.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.140
Strange.

50:17.160 --> 50:18.902
This is a book shaped like an iron cross.

50:19.183 --> 50:23.087
I never have quite figured out how to... I have to get the light here.

50:23.107 --> 50:23.488
Look at this.

50:26.031 --> 50:29.675
These anagrams.

50:30.456 --> 50:32.298
And these letters are scored.

50:32.759 --> 50:35.903
I don't know if you can see the scoring, but they're squares of about an inch.

50:36.383 --> 50:36.864
Oh, sure.

50:37.044 --> 50:37.244
Yep.

50:37.304 --> 50:39.627
You could check them out.

50:44.298 --> 50:45.079
1929.

50:50.046 --> 50:55.133
Here's a flip book.

50:55.153 --> 50:57.075
This guy is working on a butterfly.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.279
He eventually swallows it.

51:10.574 --> 51:10.914
That's great.

51:10.934 --> 51:11.335
That's funny.

51:13.778 --> 51:16.442
There is, oh, this is sort of an understatement.

51:16.482 --> 51:17.723
Anatomy of the Human Head.

51:17.763 --> 51:34.065
This is handwritten instructions for the House of Lords, the upper house, House of Lords, how they conduct themselves when the king is there, or when the king isn't there.

51:36.448 --> 51:38.751
And it's all done by hand.

51:39.071 --> 51:43.397
You know, 1641...

51:43.900 --> 51:47.304
1673, sort of, it's a manuscript.

51:48.785 --> 51:55.432
The dealer quoted me a book like this recently, and I wondered if one or the other was a forgery.

51:56.854 --> 51:58.115
Read my lips.

52:02.660 --> 52:03.981
Cute.

52:04.001 --> 52:10.768
I got this from the Bromers because of the silver plaque on the cover, and this is gold, 1758.

52:12.757 --> 52:18.382
This came from the Baileys in Victoria and whatever his name is, the dealers out in California.

52:19.583 --> 52:24.727
And why they would ever publish a book on that color paper, I wouldn't know.

52:24.927 --> 52:28.210
You can't read it, you know.

52:28.230 --> 52:30.472
But it's a limited edition.

52:33.674 --> 52:34.415
Oh, kiss me, son.

52:34.435 --> 52:35.356
A hundred colors.

52:38.979 --> 52:39.199
It's funny.

52:39.219 --> 52:40.640
It's shaped like a triangle.

52:41.901 --> 52:42.662
Yeah, this is...

52:44.161 --> 52:52.050
This is a wash drawing.

52:52.350 --> 52:58.437
Those are cut out figures with feathers pasted on them.

52:59.098 --> 53:00.420
It's a strange concept.

53:03.303 --> 53:04.624
Look at the work that went into that.

53:06.827 --> 53:08.949
See, the cow is cut out, the figure is cut out.

53:09.009 --> 53:12.193
This is painted here, and then there are feathers.

53:13.844 --> 53:15.866
Now, you must admit that's an oddity.

53:15.886 --> 53:17.948
Yeah, but it's cleverly done, isn't it?

53:19.929 --> 53:30.759
Yeah, yeah.

53:30.779 --> 53:33.662
Oh, these are photographs of some kind.

53:33.722 --> 53:34.703
I mean, that's a film.

53:35.644 --> 53:36.564
And they're acoustics.

53:36.644 --> 53:38.526
I've never figured it out.

53:39.827 --> 53:41.809
But it must be early for...

53:43.865 --> 53:47.489
1870 for this kind of illustration.

53:47.509 --> 53:47.869
See that?

53:48.370 --> 53:51.533
Yeah, it's amazing.

53:51.553 --> 53:52.574
This is quite a collection.

53:52.594 --> 53:55.617
Remember how you used to drop an ink on a paper and fold it?

53:55.637 --> 53:56.398
Well, there was a book.

53:56.678 --> 54:02.505
Called the Blatt Book, and it's like a Rorschach test.

54:06.489 --> 54:06.989
Yeah.

54:07.009 --> 54:09.552
Emily Robinson 1917, yeah.

54:12.518 --> 54:13.899
They're also my blot.

54:14.300 --> 54:17.102
Yeah, well, it's, to me, an oddity.

54:19.044 --> 54:20.525
A friend of mine made this for me.

54:22.747 --> 54:23.387
Ha, ha.

54:24.168 --> 54:25.069
That's a jug coming up.

54:25.209 --> 54:26.550
Yeah, a bottle of booze in there.

54:29.092 --> 54:30.754
He's a very clever fellow.

54:32.215 --> 54:33.136
I've got this book.

54:33.176 --> 54:34.797
That's one of my pop-up books.

54:34.817 --> 54:35.098
You do?

54:35.118 --> 54:36.499
Yeah, the Facts of Life.

54:36.739 --> 54:38.641
That's an interesting pop-up, isn't it?

54:38.661 --> 54:39.361
It sure is.

54:39.381 --> 54:40.202
Yeah.

54:40.222 --> 54:40.723
I have that.

54:41.143 --> 54:41.243
Yeah.

54:41.999 --> 54:42.980
That was fascinating.

54:47.724 --> 54:49.506
Jonathan Miller and David Pelham.

54:49.526 --> 54:52.689
I just bought this a couple weeks ago on an antique show.

54:52.709 --> 54:53.229
That's cork.

54:54.250 --> 54:59.875
Covers are cork, rough cork, and the pages are thin sheets of cork.

55:00.276 --> 55:01.337
But does it have anything in it?

55:01.357 --> 55:02.178
It isn't printed, no.

55:04.099 --> 55:05.481
Sheets of cork.

55:05.501 --> 55:10.285
Yeah, I have a Hamlet printed in Spain, a book like that.

55:11.125 --> 55:12.967
That's printed on thin sheets of cork.

55:14.969 --> 55:15.349
Oh, here.

55:16.310 --> 55:18.713
Here's a child's book.

55:19.313 --> 55:20.594
Disney Sound Story.

55:20.634 --> 55:21.315
We have that book.

55:21.355 --> 55:22.516
My daughter's had that book.

55:22.536 --> 55:22.737
Yep.

55:23.197 --> 55:25.219
Here it talks about, you know, laughing.

55:25.419 --> 55:32.326
You push a button, then you get goofy, and you get... And the beat.

55:32.346 --> 55:33.067
And the hammer.

55:34.668 --> 55:35.569
How do we get that for?

55:35.870 --> 55:38.552
Yeah.

55:38.572 --> 55:39.293
That's cute.

55:40.505 --> 55:41.586
It came from France.

55:41.826 --> 55:45.170
That's a book, like a triangle, shaped book.

55:49.735 --> 55:51.957
Oh, this is, I guess, concrete poetry.

55:54.039 --> 55:54.960
Strange stuff, huh?

55:54.980 --> 55:59.244
Yeah, it's funny.

56:02.327 --> 56:03.449
It looks like a flash.

56:03.469 --> 56:07.693
This is the original case, which is amazing because

56:08.973 --> 56:09.914
It's from 1779.

56:09.955 --> 56:13.821
It's a dos-a-do with guffered edges.

56:14.041 --> 56:15.243
What do you call it?

56:15.283 --> 56:17.006
Back-to-back book, dos-a-do.

56:17.026 --> 56:21.252
D-O-S is the French word for back, dos-a-do.

56:21.272 --> 56:21.954
That's beautiful.

56:22.154 --> 56:23.376
That's really quite beautiful.

56:23.396 --> 56:24.037
Three covers.

56:24.538 --> 56:25.199
Three covers.

56:25.219 --> 56:29.926
1799, and it's in the original case.

56:34.513 --> 56:36.236
It's like an accordion almost.

56:36.476 --> 56:36.837
Yeah.

56:43.212 --> 56:57.414
Oh, this is a... Well, I've forgotten what this is, but you... It's odd, huh?

56:57.434 --> 57:03.122
It's pictures of stamps or something, or... You know, it's... Probably stamps of... It's a scriptured textbook.

57:04.084 --> 57:10.013
It's a combination diary in 1820-something, and these are...

57:10.870 --> 57:14.474
scripture in the notes over here, you know, somebody's birthday.

57:14.514 --> 57:15.195
See, here it is.

57:20.141 --> 57:33.577
This record book of his prisoners by Warden at the Mantua Prison in Ireland, 1856 and 57.

57:36.080 --> 57:37.622
This is record book.

57:37.642 --> 57:39.004
Here's prisoner number one.

57:39.693 --> 57:50.028
James Montgomery, night thing or whatever it is, age 38, convicted in Dublin of uttering a forged deed.

57:50.288 --> 57:53.893
Sentenced six years, penal servitude.

57:54.274 --> 57:57.719
Clerk in the office of something.

57:58.700 --> 57:59.481
Railroad.

58:00.463 --> 58:02.345
Railroad company.

58:02.486 --> 58:03.507
And he's got his...

58:04.060 --> 58:13.233
Dennis Lallon, prisoner number Loughlin, age 20, convicted in court of burglary and robbery, sentenced to 14 years transportation.

58:13.874 --> 58:18.140
This prisoner was 15 times previously convicted of larcenies.

58:20.403 --> 58:22.486
That's where I got the heavy time.

58:22.627 --> 58:23.708
To me, that's an odd one.

58:23.928 --> 58:26.412
Yeah, that is.

58:26.432 --> 58:27.874
What is this?

58:34.587 --> 58:37.410
Oh, think of the work that went into this.

58:38.692 --> 58:42.797
Somebody has drawn these designs, and it used to be a hobby of people.

58:42.817 --> 58:49.525
They'd cut out seals and such from envelopes and stationery.

58:49.565 --> 58:57.535
And this person has made these designs and pasted in the seals.

58:57.555 --> 59:00.278
But look at the work that went into that.

59:00.298 --> 59:02.080
Some of them have been identified in it.

59:03.578 --> 59:04.860
You know, it's unique.

59:04.900 --> 59:05.941
There couldn't be another one.

59:08.185 --> 59:09.547
Every design is different.

59:13.473 --> 59:14.234
That's amazing.

59:14.434 --> 59:15.155
Isn't that amazing?

59:15.175 --> 59:16.056
Yeah, that really is.

59:21.725 --> 59:22.666
Marine plants.

59:24.148 --> 59:29.176
I said it's hard to get these plants in good condition, you know, but look at this.

59:29.216 --> 59:31.459
Seaweeds.

59:31.928 --> 59:37.197
These are actual seaweeds that are laid in, pasted in, one per page.

59:37.237 --> 59:38.078
Look at the look.

59:38.099 --> 59:39.641
They're all there.

59:39.721 --> 59:42.506
They're not identified, though, are they?

59:42.526 --> 59:44.069
No, I don't think so.

59:44.149 --> 59:45.932
No, they're beautiful, though.

59:45.952 --> 59:46.613
Look at that.

59:46.897 --> 59:50.863
It's called P-L-A-N-T-E-S, Plants, Marines.

59:50.884 --> 59:57.194
This is called C-O-T-E-S with a little accent, West of France.

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.119
West side of France.

01:00:00.399 --> 01:00:03.224
These are actual seaweeds.

01:00:03.244 --> 01:00:04.045
That's magnificent.
