00:03.642 --> 00:15.315
We're talking with Mr. Bob Abrams at Abbeville Press in New York, and you were just telling me about what you feel about books, and I thought that was a pretty interesting quote to start there.

00:15.435 --> 00:22.703
What I was saying was that I believe very strongly in books.

00:22.863 --> 00:32.974
I think they're almost the only excuse that we've got to be on this planet and do what we do.

00:33.933 --> 00:56.504
I think they, by and large, record the best of what we as human beings have to offer to any sense of creation or sense of order, sense of reason.

00:58.147 --> 01:01.932
And...

01:04.477 --> 01:14.132
They're almost redemptive, I would say, as a race.

01:16.675 --> 01:32.239
I don't know what else we can point to that gives us this quality that

01:32.860 --> 01:43.091
any kind of sentient being 10,000 years from now might look back and say, well, what did these creatures do?

01:45.133 --> 01:51.920
I mean, most of what we do is indeed ephemeral.

01:52.981 --> 01:53.622
It passes.

01:54.603 --> 01:57.426
Most of what we do as human beings is ephemeral.

01:57.506 --> 01:59.188
It passes just like everything.

02:00.063 --> 02:24.298
else passes, but this need and attempt by some people to record it and to organize it and to bear witness to these acts and facts, I think, is, I mean, it's

02:24.852 --> 02:38.711
For me, it's close to a kind of a divine inspiration, and I think that that is what is contained in all these books that exist everywhere.

02:39.913 --> 02:47.063
You were born in, I mean, this is something that you probably don't ever remember, loving a book for the first time.

02:47.083 --> 02:51.990
I mean, you were born into a book family, I gather.

02:52.696 --> 02:59.983
I mean, this isn't something that you've just developed as a philosophy over the last 10 or 15 years.

03:00.043 --> 03:03.507
I suspect this is something that you've felt out of your life.

03:03.527 --> 03:05.849
Is that a fair statement?

03:05.869 --> 03:09.533
No, I don't think it's quite fair.

03:10.754 --> 03:21.825
I think it has been relatively recent that I've actually come to

03:23.020 --> 03:52.285
this kind of a conclusion I'd say the last five years or so as I've watched folly after folly and horror after horror in our own lifetime and as well as some you know wonderful things marvelous things but

03:53.463 --> 04:23.402
The only thing that actually gives some kind of form to all of these things is somebody's devotion to actually recording it, both the good and the bad, and passing that on to a broader public and anonymous

04:24.462 --> 04:26.424
public.

04:28.307 --> 04:52.596
And there's this urge and need to communicate that I think about as I try and define my own position in this chain of creation and what I do and what

04:53.622 --> 04:57.968
and what we're here for as a species.

04:59.250 --> 05:08.924
And so, I mean, I think it is relatively... It's a relatively new concept for me.

05:08.944 --> 05:10.507
It's not something I was born with.

05:10.587 --> 05:16.155
It's not something that my father ever articulated.

05:17.938 --> 05:20.481
But you were always surrounded by beautiful books.

05:20.501 --> 05:23.005
Yeah, I was very fortunate to...

05:23.710 --> 05:31.341
I grew up in a house that had lots and lots of wonderful books.

05:32.943 --> 05:49.666
I went to good schools that had good libraries, in elementary school and in high school and in college.

05:50.127 --> 05:51.068
Fabulous.

05:52.313 --> 06:03.262
libraries, I think, for the standards, relative to the standards, unfortunately, that exist in most of the U.S.

06:05.084 --> 06:14.772
I went to school, private school here in New York, ethical culture, and then Fieldston, and then Harvard, and then graduate school at Harvard.

06:15.593 --> 06:17.374
Graduate school in what?

06:17.394 --> 06:18.015
In business.

06:19.276 --> 06:19.956
I got an MBA.

06:19.976 --> 06:21.898
Did you ever go over to that?

06:22.233 --> 06:24.437
Oh, sure.

06:24.477 --> 06:26.139
I've been at the Houghton Library.

06:26.299 --> 06:27.541
I haunted the fog.

06:27.962 --> 06:42.846
One of the reasons that I chose my, at least one of the reasons I gave to myself for choosing my undergraduate major, which was unusual at the time, still is unusual.

06:43.327 --> 06:47.934
It was fine arts.

06:48.014 --> 06:49.236
I was a fine arts major.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.653
I wonder how that happened.

06:53.354 --> 07:17.805
Well, fine arts, my rationale at the time, I think, was really very, very sound, and I'm still impressed with it, and that was that there were about 20 people a year that concentrated in fine arts, and I believed strongly in the value of a liberal education, and I thought what counted really was

07:18.511 --> 07:46.341
the teachers and the education, and at Harvard they had a system of, kind of modeled on the English system, of a tutorial system, and full, I knew given the fact that

07:47.722 --> 07:59.635
there would probably be ten Harvard people and maybe ten Cliffys, that I would almost be guaranteed a full professor for my tutor.

08:00.817 --> 08:04.921
And, in fact, I had two full professors for my tutors.

08:04.941 --> 08:05.081
Really?

08:05.101 --> 08:17.155
And what I was saying was one of the criteria that made me concentrate in fine arts, which is art history in most other schools,

08:17.860 --> 08:24.915
was the amount of resources per undergraduate that I would enjoy.

08:26.879 --> 08:32.410
I would not be competing with 600

08:32.930 --> 08:37.334
other undergrads, or a thousand, whatever the number was, 800.

08:37.354 --> 08:45.763
Did the family profession, though, have any, I mean, is it just coincidental that your father was publishing books on fine arts that you could?

08:46.583 --> 08:52.569
Well, it made me feel less strange in going in that direction.

08:52.589 --> 09:02.599
And I also, I'm sure, subconsciously knew that I certainly could put it to some use.

09:02.933 --> 09:12.006
despite the widespread conception that it was useless.

09:12.707 --> 09:32.755
But as I said, I believe and still do believe very strongly in the value of a liberal education and being educated to be educated, because education isn't something that stops

09:33.106 --> 09:39.915
at school and it doesn't stop when you're finished with school.

09:40.295 --> 09:52.531
Let me just interject one reason I've enjoyed being a book review editor for the last 13 years and considered one of the great jobs in the world is that it's a continuation for me of a liberal arts education.

09:52.551 --> 09:57.898
I mean, to get all these books every year and pick what I want to read.

09:58.199 --> 10:01.543
I assign myself because I assign books to my reviewers.

10:01.878 --> 10:02.479
It's wonderful.

10:02.939 --> 10:10.029
There is no substitute I quite agree with on.

10:10.089 --> 10:10.550
Yeah.

10:10.630 --> 10:13.254
But if you get the good one, it doesn't matter.

10:13.274 --> 10:26.572
I don't really think it does matter whether it's in art history or whether it's poetry or whether it's psychology or sociology or anything.

10:26.612 --> 10:30.417
The key is being exposed to a great mind.

10:31.122 --> 10:36.229
And I was very fortunate at Harvard.

10:36.349 --> 10:54.314
I had, early on, a freshman tutorial with Eric Erickson, a great mind in psychology and psychiatry, and there were roughly sixteen of us in a freshman year tutorial.

10:54.334 --> 11:00.943
Well, you know, it's one thing to sit with a teaching assistant

11:01.514 --> 11:30.812
who really is more concerned with their own advancement through the hierarchy of an educational institution, and maybe I'm doing teaching assistance a disservice, but very often that can be the case, versus sitting with somebody who is mature and

11:31.012 --> 12:00.563
self-confident in their abilities and their knowledge and their lack of knowledge and is inherently interested in teaching and when you get a great teacher it doesn't matter whether they're teaching biology or art history or poetry or

12:00.914 --> 12:04.218
even math or science or anything like that.

12:04.238 --> 12:05.779
Did you come directly into the business?

12:09.503 --> 12:18.714
No, I mean, after college, I then worked with my father in his old publishing company.

12:18.734 --> 12:24.560
Which still retains his name as your name?

12:24.580 --> 12:24.660
Yes.

12:26.463 --> 12:31.751
That's Harry Abrams, and that is my type of statement.

12:31.771 --> 12:31.872
Yeah.

12:31.892 --> 12:33.935
And, uh, Harry N. Abrams.

12:33.955 --> 12:35.557
Harry N. Abrams.

12:35.578 --> 12:41.226
Yes, he sits there looking down at your portrait of Norman Rockwell that Norman Rockwell did.

12:41.948 --> 12:44.852
Oh, I was glad you pointed that out.

12:44.872 --> 12:50.361
That's something that goes in the notes.

12:55.420 --> 13:04.531
Well, at the time, he asked me whether I wanted the business.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.532
It was soon after.

13:05.572 --> 13:18.568
I went to work with him, because it was a time when people were merging companies left and right.

13:19.429 --> 13:23.554
There was the first discovery of

13:24.968 --> 13:28.892
publishing as a growth industry in the 60s.

13:28.912 --> 13:33.576
Something other than the cottage industry, I guess.

13:33.596 --> 13:37.861
And it was the knowledge, it was called the knowledge industry.

13:39.743 --> 13:46.109
In the 70s, it was the information industry, it was everything except publishing, which gave it a higher multiple.

13:46.129 --> 13:52.495
But at the time,

13:54.753 --> 14:04.845
I had experienced, I was experiencing difficulties with my father that had nothing to do with the business, and everything to do with just the father-son relationship.

14:08.269 --> 14:14.577
And I felt that if I said that I wanted the business, I would have ended up with the business and lost the father.

14:16.219 --> 14:20.043
And I chose to have the father.

14:21.285 --> 14:23.207
So at that point,

14:24.065 --> 14:32.313
Soon thereafter, Dad had received an offer that was attractive, and the business was sold, and I went to work down on Wall Street.

14:33.614 --> 14:34.235
This was about when?

14:34.815 --> 14:35.916
It was 1966.

14:42.322 --> 14:52.452
My father, I'd like to point out, didn't finish ninth grade in high school.

14:56.600 --> 15:07.191
yet rose to be an incredibly important force in book publishing.

15:07.211 --> 15:20.806
Do you have a feel for what attracted him to do with the books, beautiful books with the empires and beautiful books?

15:20.826 --> 15:21.907
Books and works a lot in the wrong way.

15:21.927 --> 15:24.970
But he certainly set the standard.

15:26.435 --> 15:29.460
I can only speculate.

15:30.221 --> 15:54.838
He had studied at the Art Students League and loved art and trained in the advertising industry and taught himself design and layout.

15:59.037 --> 16:01.280
The family goes back.

16:01.421 --> 16:19.026
I'm not sure whether it was my great-grandfather who was supposed to be an extremely learned rabbi or not, but my grandfather was supposed to be extremely bright.

16:21.971 --> 16:22.952
But he had a shoe store.

16:23.673 --> 16:28.200
And Dad dropped out of school to

16:29.362 --> 16:34.731
help his father and help the family earn money he had to.

16:36.573 --> 16:44.706
Actually, his father ended up failing as a shoe salesman.

16:44.726 --> 16:57.006
My father, however, was extremely good as a salesman, a shoe salesman, and ended up supporting the family selling shoes.

17:00.462 --> 17:14.474
So how he got into book publishing, it came from the Art Students League, and I suppose a generational respect for learning and knowledge.

17:15.475 --> 17:30.368
And he found his way into working at the Book of the Month Club in its very formative years with a man named Harry Sherman, who was kind of a

17:34.229 --> 17:42.580
a mentor, father figure to him, a kind of a genius in his own right.

17:44.442 --> 17:59.041
And in the Book of the Month Club's most formative years, Dad was held basically three positions.

17:59.141 --> 18:01.745
He was the art director.

18:01.765 --> 18:04.168
He was the director of advertising and promotion.

18:05.262 --> 18:09.488
and also director of production.

18:10.710 --> 18:15.617
He understood business and the market, shall we say.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.919
Well, he was a workaholic.

18:16.939 --> 18:25.591
He was extremely talented and, you know, he was brilliant.

18:25.651 --> 18:34.223
I mean, he could do all those jobs and do them brilliantly.

18:34.928 --> 18:37.131
largely self-taught.

18:39.393 --> 18:41.496
When did he start Harry Ann Abrams?

18:41.516 --> 18:44.419
He started that in 1949.

18:50.246 --> 18:55.312
When do you think he started collecting his own books?

18:55.973 --> 19:02.421
I think it must have been

19:04.325 --> 19:07.028
in the 20s and 30s, I'm not exactly sure.

19:07.048 --> 19:09.750
He was a young man.

19:11.231 --> 19:17.517
As he got into the book business, certainly the book of the month of and before that.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.622
Is the focus strictly art books?

19:25.405 --> 19:28.468
No, it was all books.

19:29.909 --> 19:34.213
Can I just get you to sign those, please?

19:35.341 --> 19:41.847
Where were we?

19:41.907 --> 19:48.053
You were asking whether he collected just art books?

19:48.093 --> 19:49.834
But that was the principal focus, perhaps?

19:49.894 --> 19:51.236
No, no.

19:51.296 --> 19:52.717
He loved books.

19:53.277 --> 20:01.625
The fact that you said that he finished in ninth grade, the fact that he wasn't formally educated but had this great reverence.

20:03.127 --> 20:03.627
Obviously.

20:04.349 --> 20:08.876
for thought, for achievement, for the printed word.

20:08.896 --> 20:11.420
This must have had something to do with his reverence for books.

20:12.061 --> 20:15.786
These are the instruments of education, I think.

20:15.806 --> 20:25.721
Much of what you articulated earlier about what books represent seems to have all, I would have to think, is your father's philosophy as well.

20:25.741 --> 20:28.245
Maybe you're making an assumption here.

20:28.265 --> 20:28.846
I don't know.

20:29.887 --> 20:33.613
It could have been

20:34.943 --> 20:40.511
You know, I wouldn't say he would disagree with what I articulated.

20:40.711 --> 20:41.953
He never articulated it.

20:42.514 --> 20:44.897
But he loved his book, too, didn't he?

20:44.917 --> 20:45.999
Yeah, he loved his book.

20:46.019 --> 20:46.720
Did he say he loved him?

20:46.740 --> 20:47.381
Was it obvious he loved him?

20:47.561 --> 20:50.465
How did he express his love for these books?

20:50.485 --> 20:53.750
He spent all his time at them, for sure.

20:53.770 --> 20:57.395
Publishing them, which means I'm making them.

20:59.097 --> 21:03.263
But, you know, I think you have to be...

21:06.078 --> 21:18.731
careful about generations and where it all comes from.

21:18.751 --> 21:29.263
And you have a reverence and a respect for my father.

21:30.444 --> 21:31.545
I don't think it's

21:32.656 --> 21:34.679
any more than my own.

21:34.899 --> 21:53.183
I don't think it's, it might not be any less, but I think, you know, my own feeling is that the old Abrams Company is haunted by his ghost.

21:55.906 --> 21:57.188
You know, I'm not.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.452
You know, I think

22:01.310 --> 22:04.573
I distinguish myself from my father.

22:06.415 --> 22:08.196
He had certain things that I don't have.

22:08.276 --> 22:12.220
I've got certain things that he doesn't and didn't have.

22:15.823 --> 22:30.777
So that to attribute whatever I say as something that must have come from him, I think is kind of unfair.

22:31.162 --> 22:44.297
If he didn't say it, and if he didn't express it, well, it's not to say that he wouldn't agree with my particular expression, but it doesn't necessarily mean that my particular expression, you know, is what he felt.

22:45.899 --> 22:52.687
He had a need, he had a need, it was first generation, he came here at four.

22:55.630 --> 22:56.311
From England.

22:56.912 --> 22:59.515
He was born in England.

23:01.874 --> 23:12.587
you know, the degree to which, you know, his passion for books was an obsession or a need or, I mean, things differ.

23:13.968 --> 23:29.907
And I'm not, as much as I appreciate my father and his achievements, as I look at Abbeville,

23:31.574 --> 23:41.048
Happyville is a company that has been run by me, largely.

23:41.128 --> 23:47.377
Dad, we started the company together in 1977, and Dad died in 1979.

23:47.397 --> 23:53.446
1979 is a long time ago.

23:55.790 --> 23:56.631
Dad was lucky.

23:56.731 --> 24:00.737
He was really lucky in his life.

24:01.628 --> 24:14.845
1979, just when he died, was when Volcker started to control the money supply and interest rates shot up.

24:21.614 --> 24:25.138
He didn't have to live through that.

24:26.941 --> 24:37.352
Do you think your father founded the company, this new company, with the idea of doing something that you can tell us?

24:37.372 --> 24:38.653
I mean, he'd already done it.

24:38.673 --> 24:40.375
Yeah, but he had to continue.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.317
The old company kicked him out.

24:42.337 --> 24:56.712
Basically, they kicked him upstairs, because they couldn't accept being run by an entrepreneur anymore.

24:57.299 --> 25:00.804
try and bring it under some kind of corporate control.

25:03.027 --> 25:09.015
Can you say it was delightfully idiosyncratic?

25:09.216 --> 25:12.200
I don't think there was anything idiosyncratic about it.

25:12.420 --> 25:13.642
It was personal.

25:13.662 --> 25:14.764
It was personal.

25:15.084 --> 25:15.404
Yeah.

25:16.125 --> 25:20.792
He hadn't been able to

25:23.506 --> 25:36.159
bring in a successor, and I don't think that the company, the taxpayer company, should be faulted for wanting to encourage and provide for succession.

25:36.339 --> 25:50.914
But the way they did it was about as ungracious and as inept as the way most corporations act.

25:51.721 --> 25:53.884
You mean how they handled your father's departure?

25:53.904 --> 25:54.785
Yeah.

25:54.805 --> 25:59.631
And they maintained to this day that he resigned.

26:00.612 --> 26:03.116
That's really the cover, isn't it?

26:03.136 --> 26:03.236
Yeah.

26:03.256 --> 26:16.894
I mean, when you say, when you take somebody, you take the general's horse out from under him and say that he's resigned, I mean... He's being returned to Washington for administrative duties or whatever.

26:16.974 --> 26:20.378
We take him out of the field.

26:21.607 --> 26:48.829
At that point, having done other things after I went to business school, and at that point when my father was forced out,

26:50.868 --> 26:56.434
He said to me, well, we'll start our own publishing business.

26:56.454 --> 27:02.860
So there wasn't anyone else in the room, and I knew he meant him and me.

27:03.701 --> 27:07.385
And I wasn't about to say, what do you mean, we white man?

27:07.425 --> 27:11.089
The old Canto line.

27:11.709 --> 27:18.276
But in fact, I knew how important it was for him to keep

27:18.745 --> 27:19.206
going.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.910
I mean, he didn't have anything else than publishing.

27:23.130 --> 27:23.691
He was 72.

27:23.831 --> 27:31.541
I mean, he was monomaniacal about publishing.

27:31.561 --> 27:34.925
So I don't think I'm monomaniacal.

27:34.965 --> 27:36.828
I don't think I've got the same needs.

27:36.848 --> 27:47.941
I've got a different set of resources, conditions that I've grown up with.

27:48.122 --> 27:48.482
And so

27:48.884 --> 28:00.974
So, that's why I'm saying to attribute everything to the old man isn't real.

28:01.895 --> 28:05.158
You were working down on Wall Street, I think you said, at that time.

28:05.298 --> 28:05.418
Yeah.

28:05.438 --> 28:11.223
No, I had worked on Wall Street after working for my father.

28:12.004 --> 28:18.469
I wrote one of the first reports on the CATV industry without having taken a course in economics.

28:19.411 --> 28:35.130
Because, again, I had a good teacher, an analyst down at Lehman Brothers who was terrific.

28:38.754 --> 28:46.684
I certainly wouldn't want my kids burdened with my achievements or my sins, whatever they may be.

28:47.103 --> 28:51.868
and I want them to be judged on their own, for their own lives.

28:52.869 --> 28:55.372
And I think that's only fair.

28:56.053 --> 29:06.004
What was the attitude over at Harry and Abrams, Inc., when Harry and Abrams and Simon and Robert began every film?

29:06.024 --> 29:08.347
Was there any opposition to this?

29:08.507 --> 29:15.034
Yeah, they were concerned, and I think it reflected

29:16.972 --> 29:30.570
perhaps their own guilt at the way they had undertaken the separation.

29:36.477 --> 29:43.907
And, I mean, it was amazing because this was a Fortune 500 company and it was just

29:45.693 --> 29:47.937
You mean Times Mirror?

29:48.057 --> 29:48.938
Yeah, Times Mirror.

29:50.200 --> 29:58.594
And it was just the two of us, you know, trying to start, for some crazy reason, another art book publishing company.

29:59.215 --> 30:02.861
Yeah, that's the name of Harry and Abrams.

30:02.881 --> 30:04.444
It had and still has

30:05.251 --> 30:09.517
But as I say, I'm glad he's haunting there and he's not haunting here.

30:09.718 --> 30:11.500
Go back and just elaborate.

30:11.520 --> 30:17.970
You said you believe that your father's spirit haunts the halls of Harry and Abrams.

30:17.990 --> 30:18.832
What do you mean by that?

30:19.172 --> 30:32.372
Well, they have to live up to some kind of image of what Harry was all about.

30:33.584 --> 30:35.766
And that's what I'm saying I don't have to do.

30:35.786 --> 30:37.488
The company bears his name.

30:37.708 --> 30:45.996
It bears his name, and they've got to kind of guess, and people expect Harry Abrams to be like Harry Abrams, like my old man never died.

30:46.057 --> 30:46.717
Well, he died.

30:47.238 --> 30:47.778
He's gone.

30:50.801 --> 30:52.583
But the corporation doesn't die.

30:53.624 --> 31:01.532
So it was a thing that worked, and it's just like this idea that Walt Disney is

31:02.255 --> 31:25.617
cryogenically preserved someplace, where there's still that magic of Walt, that at this Uncle Walt, that the current owners have capitalized on.

31:25.637 --> 31:31.502
I'm afraid my feeling is that they've capitalized far too fully and run it into the ground without

31:32.191 --> 31:38.199
That's a very interesting thing, isn't it?

31:38.219 --> 31:48.993
Reinvesting in it, because I don't think there could be anything further from the original spirit of Walt Disney than the current management.

31:49.634 --> 31:53.459
But just Touchstone Pictures is not a... I mean, they own Touchstone Pictures.

31:53.479 --> 31:53.579
Sure.

31:53.599 --> 31:56.222
They do very un-Walt Disney kinds of things.

31:56.423 --> 32:02.130
Well, it's not that, and I don't begrudge them doing motion pictures, except...

32:03.123 --> 32:05.566
Well, I don't think he'd agree with our ratings, though.

32:07.368 --> 32:31.579
Yeah, I mean, again, I don't think that I wouldn't, I don't begrudge, I think it's a kind of an attitude that Walt had, and a genius, and a concern, and a fastidiousness, a concern with his characters.

32:31.719 --> 32:32.640
We did a book

32:33.582 --> 32:43.131
here at Abbeville called Disney Animation, The Illusion of Life.

32:44.252 --> 32:51.819
And it was written by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.

32:51.839 --> 33:01.348
And these were two of the great animators who worked under Walt in the classic films.

33:01.368 --> 33:01.969
And these were

33:03.738 --> 33:19.635
these are two brilliant, Stanford-educated Californians with an extraordinary artistic talent and verbal ability to express themselves.

33:19.655 --> 33:29.425
And, you know, if you look at that book, that book I think says about as much about

33:29.945 --> 33:34.589
what Walt Disney was about as any book that I think has been written.

33:37.372 --> 33:42.537
Were you thinking about parallels when you sang on that book?

33:42.557 --> 33:42.817
Oh, yeah.

33:42.837 --> 33:43.898
You brought up the parallels.

33:43.918 --> 33:49.344
Yeah, there is a, there is a, there are parallels between Walt.

33:49.364 --> 33:50.985
Were you thinking about them when you were saying that?

33:51.005 --> 33:52.226
I was aware of it, yeah.

33:52.547 --> 33:56.250
I was always aware of the parallel with Walt.

33:56.270 --> 33:59.293
And the problems of

33:59.982 --> 34:12.895
succession, and how do you come after somebody of such extraordinary genius and talent.

34:12.915 --> 34:15.398
So how have you done it?

34:15.478 --> 34:16.719
And you've done it quite successfully.

34:16.739 --> 34:20.423
I wonder how you managed to resolve that.

34:21.925 --> 34:27.070
Well, like I said, the first time around I chose

34:28.163 --> 34:29.565
the father, not the business.

34:29.685 --> 34:57.495
The second time around, I was 30-something, and I guess I was 34, and I'd done some things on my own, and Dad was 72, and it was very clear to me that I was needed, that there was urgency here, that

34:58.657 --> 35:25.727
my father would suffer tremendous anxiety, emotional distress, illness, if he wasn't kept busy, and that regardless of how I felt about him as a father, I knew his love and respect for me were extremely real, and that I owed him a tremendous debt.

35:26.146 --> 35:28.008
How many siblings, by the way?

35:28.028 --> 35:30.291
I have an older brother.

35:30.311 --> 35:31.332
Never been involved in things?

35:32.593 --> 35:50.493
Yeah, I've been involved, kind of inspirationally involved, as well as a tremendous number of ideas, and they've done a few covers for us.

35:51.033 --> 35:55.478
What was the first book that you did for Abby Bell, Robert and Harriet?

35:57.652 --> 36:00.055
but you come right away to it.

36:00.075 --> 36:00.756
It probably doesn't.

36:00.776 --> 36:01.637
No, it doesn't.

36:02.018 --> 36:02.799
No, we did.

36:02.819 --> 36:08.947
It wasn't some great moment then where you collaborated on this, on the first time of your book.

36:08.967 --> 36:14.094
Uh, no, it wasn't the, I mean, the epiphanous moment.

36:14.355 --> 36:15.797
No, I don't, I don't think so.

36:15.817 --> 36:17.679
I think we were, we were running hard.

36:17.739 --> 36:22.165
The first few, uh, years we did a, we, we packaged books.

36:22.946 --> 36:25.690
Uh, we did some reprints.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.152
Uh, we, uh,

36:28.297 --> 36:35.846
tried to get going as a business, and it was very hard.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.229
It was a business to break into it, wasn't it?

36:38.249 --> 36:42.153
Yeah, especially when you didn't have any money, as we did.

36:43.916 --> 36:56.110
Would you have liked to have been able to bring the Harry in line with what we were talking about, the succession, so to speak, following Harry Abrams with the successors at Disney, opening the new business,

36:56.613 --> 37:01.999
and having to call it Abbeville and not using the name which really is his, you know?

37:02.500 --> 37:11.470
Would you like to have been able to call this new company Harry Abrams, or did it work out better for you to have another name, Abbeville?

37:11.490 --> 37:12.271
I think it's fine.

37:12.491 --> 37:13.793
It's fine the way it is.

37:14.013 --> 37:20.580
I mean, that's, you know, they... You might have had to carry a little more baggage is what I'm suggesting, you know?

37:20.600 --> 37:26.367
I wonder how many people knew that Harry Abrams was involved in Abbeville outside of the profession, outside of the business.

37:27.713 --> 37:34.241
I think that's all that was really necessary at the early stages.

37:34.261 --> 37:46.397
At this point, I don't know how many people, again, associate Abbeville with my father.

37:46.777 --> 37:51.824
And I guess what I was pointing out, trying to point out earlier on, was my father died in 1979.

37:52.124 --> 37:56.590
There isn't much really to associate

37:57.278 --> 38:25.260
Abbeville with Harry, and the kinds of books that we publish while living very nicely within what my father did are different, and they're Abbeville, and that's what

38:25.865 --> 38:31.813
What I said is nice about not having to live with his ghost.

38:31.873 --> 38:40.405
I mean, I'm not concerned about his sitting there on the wall looking down and smiling.

38:42.047 --> 38:42.989
He did his thing.

38:43.289 --> 38:44.471
I'll do mine.

38:44.611 --> 38:45.812
My kids will do theirs.

38:46.654 --> 38:47.455
You do yours.

38:49.798 --> 38:55.686
We all do what we can, hopefully to the best of our ability.

38:56.138 --> 39:06.590
Tell me it is said, and I don't know where I saw this, but you picked the name Abbeville so you could show up earlier in LNP ahead of Harry Abrams.

39:06.690 --> 39:14.419
That was one of the criteria, and the other one was the fact that my brother lived on Abbeville Road in London.

39:14.439 --> 39:18.224
But you are essentially the first publisher in LNP.

39:18.244 --> 39:21.327
There are a couple now that are ahead of you, I guess.

39:21.347 --> 39:22.388
You're still in the first page.

39:23.169 --> 39:24.711
Let's talk now about the collection.

39:25.383 --> 39:27.786
Well, that's what I said.

39:27.866 --> 39:33.313
I'm not sure that I, you know, I qualify as a collector.

39:33.333 --> 39:34.514
Well, I think you do.

39:34.534 --> 39:38.439
Well, I love the story, so you definitely, the story is wonderful.

39:38.800 --> 39:44.146
You know, obviously I'm involved in books, but I'm not sure that I'm a collector.

39:44.186 --> 39:46.629
I can tell you right now, I love the story.

39:46.649 --> 39:48.191
Well, I'm not sure I'm a collector.

39:48.251 --> 39:51.255
I would think that I could come closer to

39:51.674 --> 39:56.361
being a collector in art, in contemporary art.

39:56.381 --> 40:04.993
Yeah, but you know what, you have assumed, you have taken, you know, we always say, we don't really own books, we're custodians of books.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.517
Books last longer than people do.

40:07.737 --> 40:17.732
And the standards, what happens, I mean, Bradley Martin's book's wonderful collection, you know, he was gone within the year, the books were being sold myself, basically.

40:18.033 --> 40:25.243
despite whatever protestations you might hear from his wife that Bradley would like to see him go to the next generation of collectors, that's baloney.

40:25.323 --> 40:31.271
The Bessemer Trust said, this is how we maximize the estate, and we sell these things.

40:31.291 --> 40:32.933
And they took $20, $30 million, whatever.

40:34.055 --> 40:38.040
Generally speaking, books do not go on to the next generation.

40:38.060 --> 40:46.892
And it's quite remarkable and unusual that you have chosen to assume custody of your father's books, and I assume, I imagine, to some extent add to them.

40:47.125 --> 40:55.179
I mean, as a collection, it's more of an accumulation.

40:57.302 --> 41:04.755
As I said, I haven't had the time to devote to it.

41:04.975 --> 41:09.683
I mean, I would like to devote to it.

41:10.965 --> 41:12.728
You know, I'm more involved in

41:13.535 --> 41:32.815
trying to create 50, 60 books a year here, and the difficulties involved in that, and next year, and the following year, and manage a backlist of 300, much less to have a collection.

41:32.995 --> 41:42.985
At some point, it would be... I mean, I've got a lot of books, and I enjoy having them, and I want more.

41:44.095 --> 41:50.882
But I'm not sure yet that I would qualify myself as a... As an active collector.

41:51.022 --> 41:51.943
As a collector, yeah.

41:52.084 --> 41:55.748
Well, tell me what the collection means to you.

41:55.768 --> 41:58.010
What books mean to you.

41:58.110 --> 42:03.296
I think I've said what books... Not the book in general, these books, the books.

42:06.519 --> 42:08.261
Well... The collection.

42:08.281 --> 42:11.925
Well, that's where I think...

42:12.158 --> 42:19.907
I don't have a real self-conscious sense of the collection, of a collection of books.

42:25.334 --> 42:34.905
I think the collection of books is yet to be made, quite frankly.

42:35.105 --> 42:41.052
I said, well, I think my collection of books is yet to be made.

42:42.230 --> 42:49.579
You know, the best things are really out there ahead of me in the next 20, 30, 40, or 50 years.

42:49.599 --> 42:52.342
That's very interesting.

42:52.402 --> 42:55.806
Tell me a little bit about the collection, because I've not seen any of it.

42:55.826 --> 42:59.610
I would at some point, if it's possible, to see some of these things.

42:59.630 --> 43:04.556
This is not possible for me today, but if it's all right with you, do you think we could get together again at some point?

43:04.576 --> 43:07.059
You could show me some of these books?

43:07.079 --> 43:10.844
Yeah, except they're... You ought to go forward with this.

43:10.864 --> 43:12.085
But they're...

43:12.976 --> 43:15.960
They're dispersed in different areas.

43:16.180 --> 43:18.383
A lot of it is in storage.

43:18.483 --> 43:21.827
I still don't have room to shelve all my books.

43:24.870 --> 43:27.053
How large is the collection ballpark?

43:27.073 --> 43:28.635
I don't know.

43:28.915 --> 43:31.378
I really don't know.

43:31.458 --> 43:32.439
It's not that huge.

43:32.499 --> 43:41.370
It's just that I know I've got at least a hundred cartons of material.

43:41.791 --> 43:42.932
Again, I'm not sure how

43:43.537 --> 43:44.979
And it's not all art books.

43:58.837 --> 44:09.150
But, you know, I do, I do like, I like the book.

44:09.251 --> 44:13.476
There are some wonderful books that

44:14.671 --> 44:18.197
my father and mother had, have.

44:18.497 --> 44:32.359
But again, I'm not, I haven't devoted the time, I haven't been able to have a curator or a librarian devote the time to pick them out and catalog them.

44:32.419 --> 44:42.214
I bought a collection of children's books some years ago, a

44:43.898 --> 44:52.230
It must have been about 200-odd volumes that I do have in one section.

44:52.250 --> 44:57.157
It's the kind of thing that I wish I could have done more of.

45:01.443 --> 45:08.013
But as I said, I really haven't had the time.

45:08.073 --> 45:13.821
You said that you feel the best of your collection is ahead.

45:14.273 --> 45:16.877
What does that mean?

45:17.297 --> 45:20.262
Does that mean that there's a bug in there?

45:20.582 --> 45:20.822
Sure.

45:20.923 --> 45:28.333
You just haven't had the time, and you're certainly a busy man trying to do 50 or 60 titles that do titles a year, as you mentioned.

45:29.315 --> 45:34.622
But this is something you expect to become more involved in, I gather.

45:35.604 --> 45:38.929
I hope so.

45:39.309 --> 45:42.694
I hope I am able to find the time to

45:43.788 --> 45:56.943
Do the individual titles span a great deal of time?

45:57.023 --> 46:03.611
Are they all contemporary art books, or are there any really old ones, like 200-year-old art books?

46:03.671 --> 46:05.172
No, there are not many old ones.

46:05.953 --> 46:09.137
I remember one of the things that I

46:10.771 --> 46:19.540
really enjoyed about my time as an undergraduate at Harvard was rummaging through the fog.

46:21.161 --> 46:27.788
And that's part of what my appraisal was, the resources per person.

46:28.168 --> 46:34.694
It was devoted to the study of someone who wanted to concentrate in art history.

46:34.714 --> 46:40.660
You have one of the most incredible art libraries at Harvard

46:40.994 --> 46:44.217
beautifully organized.

46:45.038 --> 46:51.946
And, you know, there were only twenty of us, and we had the complete run of it.

46:52.306 --> 47:01.656
So I love the old material.

47:01.696 --> 47:10.866
There's some very, you know, they're great libraries, and we owe a great debt to

47:11.707 --> 47:33.660
collectors and I'm happy to support in any way your book which I think brings out the importance of collectors and books and libraries.

47:37.786 --> 47:40.330
So whatever you think

47:42.537 --> 47:47.122
can help that I can do, I'm happy to do.

47:47.142 --> 47:47.242
Okay.

47:47.262 --> 47:53.169
I think that's about an hour on tape, and why don't I assess this and have my typist type it.

47:53.770 --> 47:57.955
One other question, and maybe I've asked it and you've answered it truthfully.

47:58.015 --> 48:12.291
I know you've answered it truthfully, but I guess I'm trying to get some kind of a sense of the meaning of these particular books to you, if they have any meaning beyond, I mean, is it kind of a personal

48:12.963 --> 48:14.905
legacy that's been passed on to you?

48:15.265 --> 48:17.507
I mean, it's not something you'd ever consider selling, certainly.

48:17.527 --> 48:21.411
You'd never consider parting with these books like that.

48:21.451 --> 48:26.016
I mean, I like having them around.

48:26.036 --> 48:29.819
And I like browsing.

48:29.840 --> 48:42.632
And certainly, in this case, I have memories of the apartment where I grew up.

48:43.152 --> 48:48.658
in the library and how nice it was to browse the books.

48:52.762 --> 49:11.961
I can't think of anything that is nicer to grow up in than a home that has a lot of books.

49:12.667 --> 49:16.612
My children or their children will feel the same way.

49:18.193 --> 49:18.674
I don't know.

49:18.974 --> 49:27.504
I certainly wouldn't load any guilt on them if they didn't.

49:27.524 --> 49:33.511
What I like is your attitude is very refreshing and you don't feel like you're carrying all this baggage.

49:35.494 --> 49:40.159
It appears to me to be a very healthy attitude.

49:40.713 --> 49:49.323
It's a very healthy attitude.

49:51.205 --> 49:57.533
I think it's definitely we all do what we have to do to survive.

49:57.553 --> 50:08.205
And I think one thing that my father gave me very early on, which maybe

50:09.603 --> 50:27.366
did it for me was, again, whatever other shortcomings there were, from a very early age, he really gave me a feeling that he respected my judgment, my opinion, I mean, from almost an incredibly early age.

50:27.386 --> 50:31.611
He really listened to me.

50:34.747 --> 51:03.505
And so I suppose, you know, it must have been, it must be that, that he dealt with me, you know, as an individual that he respected, that was clearly separate, that somehow must have made it easier for me to deal with him, and to feel indeed separate and worthy of being separate, and without

51:08.362 --> 51:19.312
and very much enjoy the differences, whatever the similarities.

51:19.332 --> 51:22.255
He'd be part of the business, though.

51:22.755 --> 51:25.778
I'm sure he wouldn't be unhappy with it.

51:25.798 --> 51:38.250
I mean, he always wanted me to get into the business, whether this was some kind of a Machiavellian way of his to make it work out, or whether

51:39.344 --> 51:44.749
It was just meant to be or whatever, who the hell knows.

51:44.769 --> 52:09.132
But I'm very proud of the things that all of us here at Abbeville have done, and I certainly don't think of it as just my effort at all, because I run the company very differently than he did.

52:10.934 --> 52:20.546
But the books we've published, I'm extremely proud of.

52:20.566 --> 52:39.591
I'm proud of the editors and the dedication and the quality and the fact that we've been able to survive and grow in what I think has been some of the most difficult times in publishing ever.

52:39.993 --> 52:51.784
still in a relatively obscure niche of people's consciousness.

52:58.451 --> 53:09.882
I'm very proud of the work that everybody's done, and I think it reflects the need, you know, this underlying need for society to communicate and to

53:10.891 --> 53:33.203
to assert that there is something worthwhile about our existence that should be preserved and available to succeeding generations.

53:35.917 --> 53:37.979
I still get a thrill.

53:38.119 --> 53:46.866
These books mean things to me, but I still get a thrill going to the Library of Congress, as I have, and any of the great libraries.

53:47.267 --> 53:56.155
It's not so much that the book is mine that thrills me.

53:59.417 --> 54:05.923
And I know what it is to collect, because I do consider myself something of a collector in art.

54:06.460 --> 54:09.544
Art or art books?

54:09.704 --> 54:09.924
Art.

54:11.386 --> 54:13.809
This is a whole other area we haven't touched on, is that right?

54:13.829 --> 54:13.989
Yeah.

54:15.071 --> 54:26.766
So I know what it is to be a collector and to feel the importance of possession and to be particularly attracted to an object.

54:30.090 --> 54:35.877
Is a book different than an art piece, an artwork, a painting, as an object?

54:36.633 --> 54:48.770
A painting you put on the wall and you enjoy, almost collectively, a book is something that sometimes nobody knows you won't except yourself.

54:49.391 --> 54:52.275
That's also true in a piece of art.

54:53.857 --> 54:55.079
You know, I don't know.

54:55.159 --> 55:05.914
I think that's a different... That's why I'm... what I was expressing to you, I'm not sure that I am

55:06.502 --> 55:12.949
a collector, in the sense that you have been dealing with collectors.

55:12.969 --> 55:15.532
You're not driven to acquire books.

55:16.333 --> 55:20.518
No, I would like to, as I enjoy, you know, and do from time to time.

55:20.538 --> 55:21.479
Are you driven to collect art?

55:21.659 --> 55:22.360
Are you driven?

55:24.462 --> 55:26.124
You're not an obsessive person, probably.

55:26.244 --> 55:34.433
I'm not sure exactly how I'm driven beyond... Would you say that you're an obsessive person in anything?

55:35.982 --> 55:41.227
I think I have an obsession to try and understand.

55:41.247 --> 55:50.916
I think that is an obsession, to really try and understand my environment.

55:53.017 --> 56:00.104
I think I'm an infomaniac.

56:00.224 --> 56:03.627
I mean, the more information... Say that again for my type of...

56:03.691 --> 56:13.146
You caught it.

56:13.447 --> 56:30.795
And I think if we're to survive and leave something, again, better for our children and for our children's children and our friends' children,

56:31.518 --> 56:33.421
something for the world.

56:33.621 --> 56:58.656
We have to be able to understand what's going on, not just participate in it, not just go along with the flow and just be moved, but we have to be able to reflect and make sense.

56:58.716 --> 56:59.938
And that is what, in fact,

57:00.509 --> 57:04.493
people try and do when they try and write a book.

57:05.495 --> 57:17.468
It's an individual's attempt to organize that which is not necessarily organized at all.

57:17.568 --> 57:18.649
It's random.

57:19.450 --> 57:30.162
And to apply intelligence and care and consideration, whatever.
