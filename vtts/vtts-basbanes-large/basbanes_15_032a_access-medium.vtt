WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:08.070
when something's being taped.

00:09.532 --> 00:18.122
I guess my first question, I love the book, by the way, and I was remarking to my wife last night how very well it's written.

00:18.903 --> 00:19.604
Oh, thank you.

00:20.185 --> 00:26.893
As a book critic, it's not just content I'm interested in, it's the felicity of the writing.

00:27.254 --> 00:33.121
Well, I confess that I find myself often reading books that way.

00:34.383 --> 00:34.763
One of the

00:35.114 --> 00:51.117
And because of that, it's because I enjoy the language, and indeed, frankly, the sound of the language, I tend to read very slowly and almost read aloud to myself.

00:51.458 --> 00:53.681
It cuts down what you tend to read.

00:55.023 --> 00:56.345
How long have you been working on this?

00:56.385 --> 01:02.995
Was this done with an idea to coincide with the Constitution, the Bicentennial?

01:04.016 --> 01:04.497
No.

01:05.843 --> 01:14.314
You know, in one sense, a book like this, I've been working out all my life.

01:15.716 --> 01:19.601
You know, I saw the thoughts of the product going on.

01:19.661 --> 01:21.323
I came from a legal family.

01:24.287 --> 01:35.361
More immediately, consciously, this book, about

01:36.067 --> 01:50.521
As the acknowledgment explained, just before turning to the book, I had been working with Adrian Lowe.

01:50.562 --> 01:52.003
Do you know his work?

01:52.023 --> 01:52.263
No, sir.

01:52.964 --> 01:56.968
Adrian Lowe's an independent television producer, at least he was.

01:56.988 --> 02:00.291
He's now at the Smithsonian in Washington.

02:00.552 --> 02:03.334
He did The Ascent of Man.

02:03.354 --> 02:04.015
Oh, sure.

02:04.265 --> 02:10.912
He did Carl Sagan's Cousins.

02:11.993 --> 02:22.183
And Adrian and I and Houghton Mifflin were projecting a thirteen-part series on the Supreme Court of the United States.

02:25.026 --> 02:32.533
And there would have been a very different book gone with the TV series.

02:33.762 --> 02:39.951
had to raise more money than he could raise from the foundation.

02:40.151 --> 02:51.307
And when that fell through, I had had it in the back of my mind that I would write a book about the Constitution and the courts sometime.

02:53.671 --> 03:03.685
If it hadn't been for that work with Adrian, I probably would have written a book for a much narrower audience.

03:05.015 --> 03:18.514
The other thing that fitted in here was that when I became a university professor at Harvard, I began teaching an undergraduate course as well as teaching at the law school.

03:20.036 --> 03:34.617
And college students are not very different from the kind of person you would hope might be interested in reading this book.

03:35.305 --> 03:41.011
preparing those lectures, in a way, headed into the book.

03:42.373 --> 03:55.868
It was—it all came together more by chance than by design in the year of the Bicentennial.

03:55.888 --> 04:03.777
I wonder, sir—certainly, I'm sure, I'm sure that most, just about every person who is interviewing new

04:04.432 --> 04:23.098
is truly interested in your Watergate experiences, and I wonder if you could reflect for a moment on whether or not you had any idea when you were appointed as Special Prosecutor that you yourself would have a fundamental role in constitutional history, as certainly you did.

04:24.560 --> 04:31.890
I don't think that I ever would have thought of in those terms, no.

04:32.191 --> 04:53.835
I think of the terms I probably would have sought in, whether my role might be similar to that of Owen J. Roberts in the Teapot Doan investigation.

04:54.896 --> 05:00.662
A very important investigation, depending a little on the outcome.

05:01.840 --> 05:14.053
But not something that would seem, as I think it did become, of major constitutional security.

05:14.073 --> 05:27.848
The other thought I had at the outset, and I remember so vividly my conversation with my wife about whether to accept the assignment

05:28.958 --> 05:31.742
I said to her, this is a no-win job.

05:36.350 --> 05:45.764
Meaning, I thought there was a high degree of probability that it would be inconclusive.

05:45.785 --> 05:54.358
That the result would be that the admirers of Richard Nixon would say that if Cox

05:56.684 --> 06:00.610
weren't a Democrat and a Kennedy person.

06:00.630 --> 06:04.716
He'd exculpated the Nixon administration.

06:04.736 --> 06:24.565
The opponents of Richard Nixon would have said, if Cox weren't so dumb, I would have simply suffered the fate that a great many investigations of wrongdoing come to that you couldn't get the evidence that proved

06:27.110 --> 06:32.318
That's recollection, not reconstruction.

06:32.478 --> 06:36.485
I really did think that was the probability.

06:36.505 --> 06:41.713
But looking back, was it a no-win situation in terms of the aftermath?

06:42.434 --> 06:44.417
Oh no, no, no, oh no.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.961
It certainly was a triumphant.

06:46.981 --> 06:48.604
Oh no, it was altogether wrong.

06:49.165 --> 06:51.088
It was altogether wrong.

06:51.128 --> 06:53.792
Oh yes, that was what I thought.

06:54.430 --> 06:57.915
That was the perception prior.

06:58.575 --> 07:03.622
It turned into a very wrong perception, there's no doubt about it.

07:03.642 --> 07:12.734
There certainly were a few days which you described most dramatically here, starting with that evening where you talked with Elliot Richardson.

07:12.754 --> 07:17.080
He was having his first dinner at the White House.

07:17.195 --> 07:24.547
And then culminating, of course, with the Saturday evening massacre, as it has come to be called.

07:25.248 --> 07:31.377
You certainly must have known at that point that you were deep in a historic confrontation.

07:37.447 --> 07:43.877
Yes, I guess...

07:45.190 --> 07:56.486
I guess the answer really is yes, although I was so concerned with the immediate and with its importance in that sense.

07:56.787 --> 08:02.094
Well, presidential noncompliance would have really been a constitutional crisis.

08:02.976 --> 08:04.438
Oh, absolutely.

08:04.458 --> 08:15.113
The only thing that led me not to answer yes, of course, is that I don't think at that time that I...

08:15.548 --> 08:19.613
ever would have applied the adjective historic.

08:19.873 --> 08:29.584
It doesn't make it inaccurate, but I'd have thought it of enormous importance, critical things of that kind.

08:29.604 --> 08:31.867
I wasn't thinking about what history will say.

08:31.907 --> 08:33.128
That's what I meant.

08:33.148 --> 08:39.135
Except for the fact that you were wondering, what are we going to do if the president says no?

08:39.155 --> 08:45.522
Yes, and I was worrying about the consequences for our constitutionalism and the law.

08:46.092 --> 08:54.965
No, all the thoughts were thoughts that lead one to apply the adjective historic.

08:55.005 --> 09:01.354
I just don't think I ever thought, well this will go into the history books.

09:01.815 --> 09:02.496
At that point.

09:02.576 --> 09:09.366
Yeah, one was much more concerned with how it would come out, with what was at stake.

09:10.797 --> 09:20.207
One of your primary theses here is that our system is rooted in voluntary compliance.

09:20.367 --> 09:31.839
I wonder if you could just discuss that for a minute, how it has managed to thrive for 200 years, for two centuries, through voluntary compliance.

09:33.761 --> 09:37.024
I don't know if that's such a question as it is seeking a comment.

09:39.181 --> 10:08.428
I think very deep in the American people has always been a sense of the importance of love, particularly as a Czech government and government officials.

10:09.168 --> 10:24.145
came down to the Founding Fathers from Britain, from the Gurdens, and the fight against the Stuart King, and even back to Magna Carter.

10:26.267 --> 10:29.731
And one thinks of other bits of recognition of it.

10:29.751 --> 10:38.601
You remember, I'm not sure where it's recounted, but it's a familiar story of the French airbags.

10:39.003 --> 10:52.862
He came into New York Harbor and was expecting him to comment on even then the skyline, although it was a much lower skyline than today, and asked his feelings when he came.

10:53.243 --> 11:02.836
Instead of referring to skyline or liberty, he said, ah, to scent the sweet smell of legalité.

11:04.318 --> 11:05.500
That's nice.

11:05.733 --> 11:09.399
We ought to talk about the lawlessness of Americans.

11:10.500 --> 11:23.901
And in a certain sense, the frontier did bring a kind of lawlessness to challenges to authority.

11:25.023 --> 11:33.816
But I don't think that was anywhere near as deep-seated as the importance of government under law.

11:34.859 --> 11:51.008
I think this is deep in the American people, even though they don't consciously think in terms of those sayings of liars, historians.

11:51.028 --> 11:59.483
There have always been challenges, issues, and stuff.

11:59.868 --> 12:03.412
And one hopes there always will be, certainly.

12:03.492 --> 12:06.595
Well, there always will be.

12:09.899 --> 12:18.709
The law in a formal sense can be quite wrong in the sense of an aspiration and ideal.

12:22.313 --> 12:26.297
I think it does still command our allegiance.

12:26.952 --> 12:30.980
Watergate was a challenge of the highest levels of government.

12:31.801 --> 12:37.572
Iran was a challenge of the highest levels of government.

12:37.592 --> 12:39.676
By the way, would you like a picture without the coffee cup?

12:39.997 --> 12:41.620
Would that make any difference?

12:41.640 --> 12:43.504
I don't have it at all.

12:43.844 --> 12:43.925
OK.

12:44.145 --> 12:46.750
I'll put it down in just a second.

12:47.692 --> 12:53.559
I did want to get to Iran-Contra and ask you to compare the two as constitutional crises.

12:54.880 --> 13:17.226
Which do you think threatened the Constitution more, or were they equally as threatening to our... Well... I think they had this in common.

13:18.337 --> 13:41.550
that both did involve indifference to the rule of law, disregard of the rule of law at or near to the very highest levels of government.

13:41.570 --> 13:46.858
I think the fundamental thing about both

13:47.598 --> 13:55.045
The fundamental wrong was very perceptively expressed by Jim Magruder.

13:55.065 --> 14:00.229
You remember, he was a minor Wattegate figure after Wattegate.

14:00.249 --> 14:08.637
When he said, and this is just about a direct quotation, I can't guarantee everybody was just about it, Jack.

14:08.757 --> 14:17.605
We in the White House felt that the ordinary rules didn't apply to us.

14:18.968 --> 14:22.434
We were engaged in a mission.

14:22.454 --> 14:28.404
It was the mission that counted, not the rules, meaning the law.

14:32.350 --> 14:44.571
What better description could you have of the attitude of the principles involved in our encounter?

14:45.479 --> 14:55.550
It is rather frustrating, isn't it, that in a scant 10 or 12 years, or 14 years, the same sins are repeated.

14:55.570 --> 15:11.166
It's very disturbing, and I think one of the things that the select committees ought to be asking, as should all of us, is there some explanation in the way

15:13.137 --> 15:23.206
the White House staff is organized and administered.

15:23.226 --> 15:42.722
I'm not sure of the answer, but I suggest that the topsy-turvy growth of White House staff over the last certainly twenty-five years goes a long way to

15:43.867 --> 15:56.481
to explain what happened, constituted sort of fertile soil for the right personalities to act, these characteristics.

15:57.862 --> 16:03.469
One, of course, enormous power.

16:08.114 --> 16:12.979
Two, with some rare exceptions,

16:15.811 --> 16:36.509
The White House staffs over the past twenty-five years have been men who were a sense of public life, nobodies except for the president's favor.

16:36.529 --> 16:36.969
That's interesting.

16:36.989 --> 16:45.396
And if they lost the president's favor, they would go back to being nobodies again, in the public sense.

16:48.869 --> 17:02.670
Now, I think the combination of those two very quickly breeds an attitude that, well, what I must do is please the boss.

17:03.592 --> 17:06.776
Nothing else counts except pleasing the boss.

17:09.721 --> 17:17.593
Congress, everyone else, becomes outsiders, becomes sort of enemies.

17:18.299 --> 17:21.883
You use your power to manipulate them.

17:21.903 --> 17:35.478
But it must be frustrating to think that with what we went through in Watergate and culminated with the resignation of a president that some lessons might have been learned, and apparently they weren't.

17:35.858 --> 17:40.303
Well, you're right.

17:40.323 --> 17:41.424
It is.

17:43.327 --> 17:48.272
And unfortunately, to come back to your similarities and differences,

17:48.826 --> 18:04.405
Well, unfortunately, the, well, I think what I've said is really the key thing in the Iran chapter, as it was a measure.

18:04.425 --> 18:08.150
It's a much more complex picture.

18:08.170 --> 18:18.242
It's much harder to cut through all the details, all the good intentions

18:19.640 --> 18:23.566
in the sense of the mission in Iran Patra.

18:23.666 --> 18:31.458
The mission, at least immediately, and Watergate affair wasn't very worthy.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.820
It was to get re-elected.

18:33.581 --> 18:35.143
It was politically selfish.

18:36.185 --> 18:48.904
Now, they may have hoped to do good things when they got the political power, but it, whereas a man who was flying

18:50.791 --> 19:13.074
to the importance to our whole system of government and national life, of the role that high officials are subject to the law, could honestly believe he was doing good in seeking to get the hostages free and to aid the conquerors in Nicaragua.

19:13.194 --> 19:17.018
I think that view is misguided, but a man could honestly hold it.

19:17.386 --> 19:21.251
Well, I remember Colonel North's quote that I thought it was a neat idea.

19:21.271 --> 19:23.254
Remember he said he thought... Yes.

19:23.434 --> 19:27.400
And then I wondered, the situation just cried for a response.

19:27.460 --> 19:31.626
Do you think constitutional government is a neat idea as well?

19:31.646 --> 19:33.348
Right, right.

19:33.368 --> 19:39.036
I was just wishing somebody would have said something like that to him.

19:40.558 --> 19:46.566
Well, the White House staff, my understanding from the outside, is...

19:47.137 --> 19:51.481
Remarkably free freedom.

19:51.622 --> 19:59.490
In this particular administration, or as a— I think in lots of ways, in lots of administrations.

19:59.510 --> 20:11.602
Perhaps quite— The power to pick up the phone and to say, this is so-and-so in the White House encourages, pretty clearly.

20:11.742 --> 20:12.383
And arrogance.

20:12.763 --> 20:14.405
Yes.

20:14.946 --> 20:16.367
Do you see erosion?

20:16.752 --> 20:18.174
in the Constitution?

20:18.234 --> 20:21.377
I mean, does this indicate, is this disquieting?

20:21.397 --> 20:24.541
Do you see any erosion in the power of the Constitution?

20:27.745 --> 20:31.009
I believe not in the law, Paul.

20:31.029 --> 20:38.517
I'm not by nature an optimist.

20:42.302 --> 20:45.105
Not an optimist in the sense that I am

20:46.638 --> 21:03.984
I think we're going to reach the New Jerusalem ever, but in the sense that I think there were a lot of stumbling and often steps backward to graduate and make some human progress.

21:04.004 --> 21:12.737
And I don't think that what I call the great American adventure has ended, I think.

21:12.757 --> 21:14.620
Basic characteristics.

21:16.051 --> 21:29.570
carried us where we are from where we were 200 years ago, and still survive, but I'm mindful there's always have been flow, and the process always has been.

21:30.631 --> 21:34.617
I'm going to just turn this tape on the other side.
