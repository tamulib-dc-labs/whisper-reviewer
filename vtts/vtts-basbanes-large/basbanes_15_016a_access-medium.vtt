00:02.225 --> 00:03.466
Dr. Alex Higgins.

00:04.427 --> 00:06.309
It's January 19, 1994.

00:08.892 --> 00:09.753
Where do we start?

00:10.073 --> 00:29.734
I guess I began by reading your essay, My Liberal Education, and I pulled out a few quotes that were very revealing to me.

00:30.524 --> 00:39.257
I guess one thing you point out is that you've gone through life and through your experiences by always keeping an open mind about everything.

00:39.277 --> 00:41.821
You've always tried to keep an open mind.

00:41.841 --> 00:55.642
You described the meeting with the young man who interviewed you for The Scarlet, for instance, and Esther Goddard had said she wondered if she needed a lawyer during the interview.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.865
It's a wonderful story.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.661
But then you told her, don't worry about it.

00:59.681 --> 01:00.682
You'll have a nice time.

01:00.702 --> 01:02.044
And she kept an open mind.

01:02.064 --> 01:07.248
You had an open mind with the Black Student Union.

01:07.288 --> 01:13.654
You kept an open mind about working on these various committees that you initially didn't want to work on.

01:13.674 --> 01:22.381
I wonder if perhaps this has been kind of a philosophy that has guided you three through your life.

01:24.123 --> 01:25.004
Thank you.

01:25.024 --> 01:26.165
We'll just start with that.

01:26.185 --> 01:26.725
How's that?

01:26.805 --> 01:27.666
We'll just outporn it.

01:31.072 --> 01:31.893
Is it running now?

01:31.913 --> 01:32.473
It's running, yes.

01:33.374 --> 01:35.316
You can talk, and you don't have to sit close.

01:35.336 --> 01:41.081
You can pick it up.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.384
I think it evolved.

01:44.204 --> 02:00.960
When I first was asked if I would be a trustee of Clark, I was actually overwhelmed with the idea and wondering what I could contribute and what it involved.

02:01.345 --> 02:07.131
I really had no idea what it involved because what it evolved into was a full-time job.

02:08.112 --> 02:14.620
But I suppose, perhaps, would you like sugar and cream?

02:16.081 --> 02:29.496
What it evolved into... In the first place I thought, how am I ever going to talk to those eggheads?

02:29.797 --> 02:35.022
I was quite in awe of them.

02:35.042 --> 02:48.495
And it evolved, but I found that they were always remarkably, I think, receptive of a woman on the board.

02:49.336 --> 02:59.466
And I really don't know why, because one trustee resigned rather than a woman on the board of trustees.

03:00.121 --> 03:02.504
old line with your family.

03:05.307 --> 03:09.511
Kind of comical, well, in misrespect, isn't it?

03:09.531 --> 03:09.612
Yes.

03:09.732 --> 03:28.913
It is, because I think it was Henshaw-Dewick, and his sons are not at all as almost reactionary as he was.

03:29.973 --> 03:33.397
And I think I was a little afraid of students.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.359
I didn't know how I was going to talk with them.

03:35.419 --> 03:56.723
So I began to feel my way along, and the more I talked with both faculty and students, the more I found that I could just enjoy them, that I was interested in what they had to say, and that there were things one needed to develop in one's own way of

03:58.677 --> 04:04.605
I hate the word dealing with people because it always sounds like wheeling and dealing to me, but it relates to other people.

04:06.388 --> 04:10.774
That could be developed to my advantage as well as theirs.

04:10.794 --> 04:20.027
And I think that's where my philosophy began at the end, actually, when I became just people.

04:28.681 --> 04:30.403
Okay.

04:30.463 --> 04:40.814
You said also, the last time we spoke here, that I guess the driving ambition of your life is to be published.

04:42.155 --> 04:42.455
Yes.

04:43.937 --> 04:47.340
And you said, you said, I'm a frustrated writer.

04:49.843 --> 04:53.367
How do you suppose that is, or why do you suppose that is?

04:56.690 --> 04:58.452
I wrote when I was a child.

04:59.377 --> 05:02.984
poetry and stories.

05:04.748 --> 05:12.364
And my father was, I think, quite proud of that.

05:13.305 --> 05:16.732
And he was always waving my flag.

05:17.594 --> 05:19.478
And it became

05:20.487 --> 05:27.778
It was quite clear to me early on that I wasn't anything like what my father thought I was and what he thought I was going to turn into.

05:27.798 --> 05:31.844
What do you think he thought you were going to turn into?

05:31.864 --> 05:34.087
He thought I might turn into a writer.

05:34.107 --> 05:37.132
He was a very curious man.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.957
There's a lot of people on him.

05:40.977 --> 05:45.444
And I don't think it's something that we want to go into right now.

05:45.464 --> 05:49.650
But he was ambitious.

05:50.457 --> 05:55.843
He was talented and he was very threatened.

05:57.245 --> 06:03.251
So I think that he thought he was going to develop through his children.

06:03.271 --> 06:04.693
I had one younger sister.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.517
A lot of the things that he had not achieved.

06:08.698 --> 06:09.258
No brothers.

06:10.399 --> 06:11.180
No brothers?

06:11.961 --> 06:12.702
No, no, no brothers.

06:14.352 --> 06:17.956
I don't know, are you a New England girl?

06:17.976 --> 06:18.917
Are you from?

06:19.378 --> 06:19.978
Middle West.

06:20.999 --> 06:24.704
I was born in Chicago and brought up in Lake Forest.

06:25.164 --> 06:28.127
And then we moved to New York when I was 18 years old.

06:28.147 --> 06:29.509
My father's business changed.

06:30.790 --> 06:37.217
So you really, you didn't know, not to jump around, but you didn't know your husband at all from childhood?

06:37.237 --> 06:37.638
No.

06:37.658 --> 06:43.144
I think you said that you both went to Milton Academy, but I guess that was just coincidental.

06:43.664 --> 06:47.490
Yes, that was a big turning point in my life, going to Northern Academy.

06:47.510 --> 06:55.282
And I've just written something about that, that they won't believe on my magazine.

06:55.322 --> 07:01.432
Turning point educationally, or spiritually, or a combination of everything?

07:01.472 --> 07:02.534
A combination of everything.

07:02.574 --> 07:03.736
I think I grew up there.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.423
I was born to a great privilege.

07:09.044 --> 07:13.811
And Gerald, in the Middle West, did not go to college enough in those days.

07:14.592 --> 07:16.315
I didn't know anybody that went to college.

07:16.876 --> 07:20.281
And I didn't have any ambitions to go to college.

07:20.301 --> 07:26.651
I just hoped that I was... One thing I wanted to do was to be married, and I had children.

07:26.671 --> 07:31.318
And that, I thought, was... I wanted to make a suitable background for a clever husband.

07:31.338 --> 07:32.300
That's what I had in mind.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.845
As much as I had anything, I think.

07:36.348 --> 07:40.354
By happenstance, I went to Milton Academy, and I think I grew up there.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.159
I got excited about learning.

07:44.239 --> 07:45.901
I got excited about literature.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.205
I got excited about a lot of things.

07:49.226 --> 07:49.627
Oh, wonderful.

07:49.647 --> 07:50.648
And I decided to go to college.

07:50.949 --> 07:51.409
Oh, you did.

07:51.649 --> 07:52.170
Which I did.

07:52.611 --> 07:56.376
I went to Vassar for a year, but I didn't like it at all.

07:57.578 --> 08:02.405
And I was an adolescent in revolt, I think, at that rate.

08:02.425 --> 08:06.270
But I think that's the time that a lot could be

08:07.094 --> 08:19.153
offered in the way of education of the emotional and spiritual side, which I think is completely neglected as far as education is concerned.

08:19.173 --> 08:23.240
You say that in the essay as well, as a matter of fact, towards the very end.

08:23.500 --> 08:28.608
I look back at that and realize that was 12 years ago, and I thought that then.

08:28.628 --> 08:35.599
I didn't realize I thought that so long ago, but I've been trying to sell it ever since, but more so lately.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.369
Do you recall offhand what years you attended Milton Academy?

08:39.829 --> 08:45.615
Yes, I graduated from Milton in 1924.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.297
And you were there how many years?

08:47.317 --> 08:49.560
A year and a half.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.922
So I was just there a year and a half.

08:51.942 --> 08:53.724
Oh, you were just at Milton Academy for a year and a half.

08:53.744 --> 09:01.232
But that made the biggest impression on me as part of my intellectual life has continued anything.

09:01.955 --> 09:12.569
Do you think it was because of the excellence of the education, or the fact that they stimulated you, or the fact that you were a growing young woman, an emerging young woman at that point?

09:13.910 --> 09:15.813
I have a great exponent in liberal education.

09:15.853 --> 09:27.328
I went to Bates up in Maine, and I just think that education in the humanities and in life is the greatest thing that you can give to yourself.

09:27.628 --> 09:29.951
This is why I'm exploring this a little bit.

09:29.971 --> 09:30.612
I couldn't agree with you more.

09:30.845 --> 09:53.418
Well, I think I discovered that I had some talent and recognized that I had been to a private day school in Lake Forest, which everybody went to with people in our circle of friends, my parents' circle of friends, and I think it was a pretty good education.

09:53.478 --> 10:00.548
I think one of the best things I got there was an education in French, which I enjoyed from the very beginning.

10:01.085 --> 10:08.779
Then I went to, as a day ago, to a high school, which really was not.

10:08.839 --> 10:15.171
There were all kinds of people there, people that I would not, in the ordinary culture of men who ever met.

10:15.191 --> 10:16.233
This is still in Illinois?

10:16.734 --> 10:16.994
Excuse me?

10:17.034 --> 10:18.577
This is still in Illinois?

10:19.018 --> 10:20.180
Yes, in Lake Forest.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.987
It's called Ferry Hall.

10:29.806 --> 10:36.032
And it's now a junior college, I think, and very good.

10:36.192 --> 10:43.660
And so my parents were occupied by themselves.

10:44.781 --> 10:55.932
And I was the oldest child, and I was kind of a surprise, I think.

11:02.189 --> 11:05.113
I'm looking every which way.

11:05.214 --> 11:12.044
I was a surprise to them, and they depended on me along my time as time went on.

11:14.308 --> 11:23.081
But when I got to Milton, I found that money wasn't as important as I had been led to believe that it was.

11:23.121 --> 11:30.272
And I found that there were people that were serious about what they were thinking about and what they were talking about.

11:31.163 --> 11:44.161
I think perhaps it was a stimulation as much as anything else because I have just put in touristy things about Milton into my essay that I just done the first draft of.

11:45.022 --> 11:53.594
And in thinking what were my memories were, I'll tell you one that I didn't put in.

11:53.634 --> 11:57.300
I find that everybody in my class at Milton was going to college.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.621
I had no thought of going to college.

11:58.641 --> 11:59.803
I wasn't entered anywhere.

12:00.577 --> 12:05.362
So, because some of my friends were going to Vassar, I decided I wanted to go to Vassar.

12:05.822 --> 12:09.305
Well, I couldn't get into Vassar because I hadn't had any Latin or Greek.

12:10.727 --> 12:13.429
My father didn't believe in the classics.

12:13.450 --> 12:18.274
He thought that there were dead languages, and that was not necessary.

12:18.314 --> 12:23.499
But he did make sure that I learned to speak French, and I learned to speak French before I was seven years old.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.343
And Vassar stood me in very good stead.

12:27.712 --> 12:35.183
It means that when I suddenly, after I was grown up and married, and wanted to learn to speak Spanish, it's very easy for me to learn Spanish.

12:35.204 --> 12:50.287
It's easy, the languages I love, and I can get on in Italian, and I can, my Spanish is not nearly as old as my friends, but I can manage all that.

12:50.307 --> 12:51.829
So I've had fun with that.

12:53.783 --> 12:59.068
Well, to go back to Milton Academy, in order to get into that, I had to have four years of Latin.

12:59.128 --> 12:59.969
I had that month.

13:00.929 --> 13:09.197
So the mathematics teacher, Mrs. Clausen, treated me twice a day for a year and a half, and I got into this Latin.

13:09.217 --> 13:11.659
Four years of Latin, a year and a half.

13:11.679 --> 13:15.663
And when I got to the Auburn virtual, I just loved it.

13:15.803 --> 13:19.046
I was fascinated by a great fun.

13:19.546 --> 13:22.209
And I did well in my writing at Milton.

13:22.229 --> 13:23.790
I was on the board of the

13:24.462 --> 13:28.128
school paper, which was beyond me.

13:28.168 --> 13:30.632
I didn't really know what I was doing there or how to do it.

13:30.672 --> 13:38.245
I think I was a drama critic, and there was precious little drama outside of my own life that I could criticize, and I didn't know how to do it.

13:39.126 --> 13:44.675
The other great influence was my English teacher, who was Mr. Simpson, who taught in the boys' school.

13:45.036 --> 13:49.423
And, of course, we didn't have any masters in the girls' school, only women teachers.

13:50.905 --> 13:54.449
But Mr. Henson used to walk across the street in the two schools.

13:54.609 --> 13:59.374
It's only become coeducational in the last few years.

14:00.395 --> 14:06.401
And he used to come across and he taught what was the Honors English course.

14:07.362 --> 14:16.972
And he was a real scholar and he was exciting and he was interesting and he was a tickler for accuracy.

14:17.452 --> 14:19.174
And I remember dashing off of

14:19.643 --> 14:28.035
piece of some kind, an assignment of some kind that had the word swimming in it, and I just wrote SW and a whole lot of those things and put a few dots on the top.

14:28.055 --> 14:44.318
And he sat down and he said, just a minute, and in front of me he counted every one of those little peaks that I'd left in there, and then he marked my papers down a grade because there was one peak missing.

14:45.260 --> 14:50.185
And so that probably something that I've never forgotten has got to be accurate.

14:51.246 --> 14:55.050
And he was also great on memorizing things.

14:55.070 --> 15:00.775
And I thought that was kind of a waste of time, honestly, from the frontier when I came from Chicago.

15:00.795 --> 15:02.958
Well, I agree with that.

15:02.978 --> 15:07.602
I think memorizing things is a fruitless exercise.

15:07.622 --> 15:09.124
I would much rather understand them.

15:10.525 --> 15:12.567
I've understood them through memorizing some of them.

15:12.968 --> 15:20.657
But what happened was that we had to do at least one stanza of the old keep to go to Nightingale for one thing.

15:20.717 --> 15:23.440
And I dilly-dallied over that and didn't get it done.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.703
And he insisted in his quiet way.

15:26.664 --> 15:30.608
And finally, I thought to hell with it, so I memorized the whole thing.

15:30.628 --> 15:32.330
And it's eight stanzas.

15:32.350 --> 15:33.712
And then I memorized a lot more.

15:33.752 --> 15:37.816
And I use that today instead of counting sheep for all the pointers I know.

15:37.857 --> 15:40.239
And I know a lot by heart.

15:40.460 --> 15:40.900
So it's good.

15:41.234 --> 15:45.999
So then you did spend a year and a half at Basser.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.421
I spent a year and a half at Milton.

15:48.202 --> 15:50.184
I'm sorry, but then how long at Basser?

15:50.544 --> 15:50.945
One year.

15:51.445 --> 15:52.146
One year at Basser.

15:52.206 --> 16:04.941
Yes, because in between, I had gone to Europe with my family, and I lived in such a different world in Europe, and again, it was like living in a Victorian novel.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.845
These are pre-Depression years, of course, as well.

16:09.095 --> 16:11.277
Just, just the pre-Depression years.

16:12.038 --> 16:33.577
But by an interesting set of circumstances, my father got to know a lot of people like Lord Birkenhead, who we knew well, and he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and an extraordinary man, Winston Churchill, whom we met.

16:33.758 --> 16:38.562
I didn't know him well, and a lot of the British aristocracy

16:39.284 --> 16:45.150
And all this was very heady and very interesting.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.433
But the life was the life of a guillotant.

16:49.314 --> 16:54.039
I used to go to the races with a girlfriend that I knew liked to do that kind of thing.

16:54.099 --> 16:55.761
We're talking about in England.

16:55.781 --> 16:56.602
In England.

16:56.622 --> 17:01.647
So when I got back to Vassar, I was spoiled, and I didn't like it at all.

17:02.588 --> 17:06.692
I didn't like being cooped up with a lot of women, for one thing.

17:07.634 --> 17:09.576
You're kind of feeling your oath a little bit.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.377
Yes, I think so.

17:11.619 --> 17:21.451
And also, again, a false set of values that I discovered eventually were not mine, and the seeds, I think, were laid at Milton.

17:21.471 --> 17:26.657
So I left, and then I went to Columbia, and I took two courses, because we lived in New York.

17:26.697 --> 17:29.601
At that time, we had moved from Chicago to New York.

17:29.621 --> 17:32.224
This is about 1920?

17:34.212 --> 17:35.613
When you went to Columbia?

17:35.633 --> 17:36.454
30, 31.

17:36.474 --> 17:36.674
Okay.

17:36.694 --> 17:37.735
Yes, about in there.

17:39.417 --> 17:42.800
So this is during the Depression, then, you studied at Columbia?

17:42.840 --> 17:47.585
Yes, but it was before the full impact of the Depression hit my father.

17:49.487 --> 18:00.878
And I took two courses, one in creative writing at Columbia, a lot at Barney, and one on 18th-century English poetry, I think it was.

18:01.499 --> 18:07.886
And then my family wanted to go somewhere, so I left again.

18:08.127 --> 18:19.820
That's all the education I have, except for, I think I have some loose credits around both at Clark and at Assumption College if I wanted to pick them up some by now and often thought, I'd really like to get a degree.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.221
I'd like to get an earned degree.

18:21.882 --> 18:23.464
But other things are more important to me.

18:24.685 --> 18:28.890
Do you feel that that's kind of an omission in your life, that you didn't

18:29.579 --> 18:31.662
complete the formal education?

18:34.966 --> 18:35.727
Yes and no.

18:35.747 --> 18:44.639
I feel, I don't feel uneducated, except that it's... I use the word formal.

18:45.500 --> 18:45.820
Yes.

18:48.364 --> 18:49.706
I've used that too.

18:50.226 --> 18:58.337
No, it just would be tidier, I guess, I feel, if I had at least had a... Well, I'm kind of

18:59.954 --> 19:08.862
flotting my way, I guess, towards the point in that it seems to me that you've basically considered your life, your education.

19:08.882 --> 19:09.963
Yes, yes.

19:10.844 --> 19:27.399
And I guess it goes back to my opening question, keeping an open mind, being alert to what's going on in life, and in your life particularly, and I guess deriving some wisdom from it, from all these various experiences.

19:27.419 --> 19:29.961
I guess maybe that's what a liberal education is

19:31.021 --> 19:36.808
I think perhaps it's the most important thing in a liberal education, and a lot of it came to me by... No, what is?

19:36.828 --> 19:39.951
I'm sorry, what's the most important thing?

19:39.971 --> 19:40.552
An open mind.

19:40.772 --> 19:42.915
Curiosity and an open mind.

19:44.377 --> 19:55.910
And respect for other people's opinions and other people's integrities, and disrespect of its offices.

19:56.551 --> 19:59.374
I feel that I've had an absolutely fascinating life.

19:59.742 --> 20:07.111
Because I'd been thinking back about it.

20:07.151 --> 20:11.396
Wasn't you—now, you met Milton while you were at Columbia?

20:11.496 --> 20:12.878
No, at Milton Academy.

20:12.898 --> 20:13.278
Oh, you did?

20:13.298 --> 20:16.883
But we—oh, the lad, he graduated a year ahead of me.

20:16.903 --> 20:17.023
I see.

20:17.904 --> 20:19.145
But we never knew each other.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.147
I see.

20:20.267 --> 20:27.876
So I didn't meet him until the Depression, when my father lost his third fortune.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.184
And my sister and I went to work.

20:30.204 --> 20:30.644
His third fortune?

20:30.665 --> 20:30.925
Yes.

20:31.766 --> 20:32.848
What was your father's?

20:34.190 --> 20:35.351
He was a businessman.

20:35.752 --> 20:46.508
He was, again, he was a man that should have had some direction and help in his life.

20:47.329 --> 20:54.319
He was the youngest of six children, and my grandmother was quite a philanthropist.

20:54.822 --> 20:57.725
And what was her name?

20:59.927 --> 21:08.336
Her name was Lydia Avery Coonley Ward, and her husband died.

21:08.437 --> 21:17.126
Coonley was my maiden name, and she married a man named Professor Ward, but she always kept Coonley, too, because she thought he was more distinguished than Professor Ward.

21:17.206 --> 21:19.789
I'm not sure she was right, but that's what she thought.

21:21.090 --> 21:22.011
And your father's name?

21:22.430 --> 21:30.439
Prentice Coomer, his name was.

21:33.222 --> 21:49.399
P-R-E-N-T-I-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-

21:50.493 --> 22:06.175
And then his brother Howard, who was an ex-older one, worked for something called the Walworth Company that made plumbing fittings, you know, on a big scale of civic kind of size.

22:06.295 --> 22:06.576
Sure.

22:07.237 --> 22:15.008
And he persuaded my father to leave Chicago and move to New York and go into business with him.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.730
And that was just before the Depression.

22:17.371 --> 22:20.095
And then along came the Depression.

22:20.564 --> 22:27.632
His Uncle Howard said he decided that there was only room for one person in the Walmart company at that level, and he was going to be it.

22:27.732 --> 22:29.193
So my father was out of the job.

22:30.194 --> 22:36.821
And he also helped a number of people and his friends had been doing the department.

22:37.682 --> 22:46.892
And he was out of the job for quite a while, and then he became the first secretary of what was called in Washington

22:47.834 --> 22:54.304
the Business Advisory Council, which is a liaison between government and business.

22:54.324 --> 23:15.597
And he's not only the executive secretary of that organization, which is still in existence, it's now called the Business Council, but he was instrumental in doing a lot of mediating and negotiating between government and industry.

23:16.252 --> 23:29.268
And he was quite a genius at it, and he used to have—he and my mother gave dinner for him at a lovely house in Washington, and they would get people to sit down at the table and talk, who would perhaps not have spoken to one another.

23:29.849 --> 23:40.943
People in the government who were looked upon as sometimes as do-gooders, and people like Manning's head of Coca-Cola, and that kind of thing.

23:44.467 --> 23:50.735
Then when the Second World War came along, he worked with Abel Herrmann, the NRA.

23:51.656 --> 23:52.257
Oh, really?

23:52.357 --> 24:03.431
I gather it was through these contacts that you went to England and met these people in the British government, if you mentioned, the Czech Republic.

24:04.453 --> 24:07.757
No, it was through horses.

24:07.889 --> 24:09.952
It was so strictly socially.

24:10.212 --> 24:13.758
Well, I'll tell you what it was because it was an interesting story.

24:13.778 --> 24:15.821
It's nothing you're going to want to... You never know.

24:16.502 --> 24:18.985
But I was brought up on a horse.

24:19.045 --> 24:28.719
We had horses and we rode and we hunted and my father played polo and that was the thing to do if you could afford to do it and not to be there.

24:28.779 --> 24:30.762
My mother was a very good horsewoman.

24:30.782 --> 24:31.784
She rode side saddle.

24:32.825 --> 24:35.449
And so...

24:35.665 --> 24:49.285
We were living in Lake Forest, and Lord Birkenhead was on a speaking tour, and a friend of my father's called and said, the one thing Lord Birkenhead wants to do when he is in Chicago is to have a chance to ride.

24:49.385 --> 24:52.490
He loves to ride, and would you mount him, take him for a ride?

24:52.550 --> 25:03.546
My father said yes, but he had a very good hunter, of whom we have a portrait, and a thoroughbred hunter, and he mounted Lord Birkenhead on that.

25:04.032 --> 25:05.654
A whole lot of people went along with it.

25:05.674 --> 25:08.898
Lord Birkenhead's daughter, Eleanor Smith, was with him.

25:10.019 --> 25:19.670
And so Lord Birkenhead had a wonderful time, and he said, whichever you come to England, I would like to return this favor.

25:19.710 --> 25:25.076
I wish you would look me up, and I'd like to mount you.

25:26.317 --> 25:32.925
And so we went to, my father and mother, I was 18, I think, and we went to England.

25:33.293 --> 25:39.422
And they took me with them, took me out of school, because this is off the record now.

25:39.442 --> 25:40.564
Okay.

25:40.784 --> 25:46.112
My father's mother... It doesn't matter if you won't let it go.

25:46.692 --> 25:57.528
It's not something I want to publish, although it's... They took me to England, and we went first to Furnace.

25:57.929 --> 25:59.571
This is my first trip to Europe.

26:01.019 --> 26:06.744
And we were going from France to England and wondering what we were going to do.

26:07.925 --> 26:20.817
And my mother said to my father, well, why don't you write your fancy friend Lloyd Burkenhead and take him up on that offer to Mount you and let's see what comes of it.

26:20.837 --> 26:21.778
So my father did.

26:22.218 --> 26:23.099
He didn't hear anything.

26:23.139 --> 26:24.060
We went to England.

26:25.041 --> 26:29.845
And we stayed at Brown's Hotel, as I remember.

26:30.601 --> 26:40.052
for a night or two, and there was a letter from Lord Bersinhead saying, I have something better to offer you than just mounting you.

26:40.112 --> 26:42.715
He said, would you like to see the Grand National Horse Race?

26:43.356 --> 26:49.263
And I would like to take you, as my guest, to be guests of the Duke of Westminster.

26:49.283 --> 26:52.046
And over the weekend, the Grand National Horse Race.

26:52.928 --> 26:53.809
So that's what we did.

26:54.029 --> 26:58.414
And then we were the only Americans there, and we were such curiosity.

26:59.255 --> 27:02.398
We were asked back three times, and we went back three times, yes.

27:03.439 --> 27:05.240
And it was just fascinating.

27:05.260 --> 27:18.212
The Duke of Westminster was a complete charmer and quite a brilliant officer during the First World War, but also very much of a bill attack.

27:18.232 --> 27:23.536
He's had a huge property called Eaton Hall outside of Liverpool.

27:23.957 --> 27:27.540
There were 50 guests staying over at Grand National.

27:27.959 --> 27:34.488
We went to the races every day in 15 Rolls Royces, and this was the whole scale that the thing was on.

27:34.608 --> 27:36.170
And we made some very good plans.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.513
And in this context that you met Churchill?

27:39.374 --> 27:47.385
Yes, yes, because then Lloyd Burke had invited us to lunch one day, and the only other guest was Churchill.

27:47.405 --> 27:51.531
Now, do I recollect that your dog's name is Winston?

27:51.551 --> 27:53.513
Is that right?

27:53.653 --> 27:54.154
Yes, exactly.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.115
That's a hard time.

27:55.135 --> 27:56.397
That's a hard time.

27:57.187 --> 28:10.665
So that was pretty heavy, you know, and for a while I thought that I would marry an Englishman because then I could have a life that I thought I might be, might to accustom myself to.

28:11.947 --> 28:23.082
When I was here last week with Sue Bowman, I think I had a note in that, a random note, and you said you would like to do a book on my mother.

28:23.983 --> 28:24.223
Yes.

28:24.440 --> 28:31.111
But in the meantime, I'm writing letters to the A, because I was cute.

28:31.631 --> 28:36.900
Could you tell me your mother's name, of course, and explain to me why you might like to write a book?

28:36.920 --> 28:39.764
My mother's name was Mary Bell Lord.

28:40.025 --> 28:41.708
Two words, Mary Bell, or one word?

28:41.928 --> 28:42.389
Two words.

28:42.729 --> 28:43.410
Okay.

28:43.430 --> 28:47.337
And she's very beautiful.

28:47.757 --> 28:50.802
She was very neurotic.

28:53.279 --> 28:54.821
She was uneducated.

28:56.404 --> 29:03.494
She was sent to boarding school in Washington, yes, in Washington, from Chicago, when her father died.

29:04.536 --> 29:08.421
Her mother died when she was two years old, and she was brought up by an aunt that she hated.

29:10.424 --> 29:12.527
And she hated boarding school, and she left.

29:12.587 --> 29:18.316
And she really had no education at all, but she had a lot of intuitive wisdom.

29:18.336 --> 29:21.801
And she was quite a charming.

29:22.152 --> 29:26.036
But if I ever wrote this book, I would call it the story of a failure.

29:26.837 --> 29:40.332
Because to all intents and purposes, by the standards with which one's life is measured, perhaps she was a failure.

29:40.933 --> 29:50.083
And I think by her own standards, she was in and out of various hospitals all her life.

29:50.570 --> 30:01.164
She had nine major operations in the days when anesthetics weren't much good and they didn't know what they were operating for, and that just seemed to be the last straw.

30:01.765 --> 30:08.553
And our life revolved around her illness, really.

30:10.035 --> 30:18.366
But at the same time, that was not the essence of her, but she never found the essence of it.

30:18.650 --> 30:35.127
Now, it's getting more... What we've learned, I think, in this life is that we're beginning to learn something about ourselves and something about other people and something about why we behave like human beings.

30:35.807 --> 30:40.933
And we've gone down an awful number of byros and by lanes, I think.

30:41.553 --> 30:48.100
And what I would have tried to do, if I'd ever written this, was to show the words of a life that to...

30:49.092 --> 30:59.664
by the standard judge, it would have seemed to be the failure, which to me was not.

30:59.684 --> 31:09.775
Do you think, when you say she was a failure, and this is your word, you clearly must have some sense of what her potential was?

31:10.976 --> 31:12.618
She had a wonderful way to speak.

31:12.698 --> 31:14.600
She was very intuitive about people.

31:15.281 --> 31:17.243
She was very helpful about people.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.240
I think that she would have had to live a whole lifetime.

31:20.660 --> 31:26.187
She would almost have had to live the life that I live to get from where she started to where she began.

31:27.289 --> 31:32.115
And as I had to do the same thing to get from where I started to where I'm ending up.

31:32.676 --> 31:34.618
And it takes a lifetime to do that.

31:35.680 --> 31:45.272
Do you think that Estrella was in some way mandated by the fact that she was almost a Victorian woman?

31:46.079 --> 32:00.600
The role of women was, I mean, I don't mean to make this into a feminist kind of an issue, but it would seem to me that perhaps circumstance contributed to this.

32:00.680 --> 32:05.628
Well, my father used to say that she had an Edwardian head and call us her old legs.

32:05.648 --> 32:09.373
That's as good a description of her as I think it was.

32:09.413 --> 32:11.276
No, she wasn't a feminist at all.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.778
My grandmother was.

32:13.298 --> 32:21.130
And my great-grandmother, whom I remember, was, she died when she was 97, and she believed in free silver.

32:21.952 --> 32:32.368
And when my mother was first brought to my grandmother's house, my father first brought her home, she sat next to my great-grandmother.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.331
Her name was Mrs. Avery.

32:35.313 --> 32:40.521
And Mrs. Avery turned to her and said, My dear, what do you think of free silver?

32:40.805 --> 32:43.308
Well, they hadn't any idea of what free shelter was.

32:43.328 --> 32:49.917
And she thought a minute and she looked at me and she said, Mrs. Avery, I just don't know what, you can't tell me.

32:49.937 --> 32:50.798
So she was this and that.

32:51.278 --> 32:52.019
That's wonderful.

32:52.199 --> 32:56.585
She was that kind of person.

32:56.905 --> 33:04.014
Jumping ahead now to the, oh, one other quote that you said that I like.

33:04.075 --> 33:07.639
You said that one accomplishment that you are

33:09.526 --> 33:13.350
who have received a Clark Honorary Degree.

33:13.370 --> 33:17.153
And perhaps you might expand a bit on that.

33:17.914 --> 33:19.736
Why is that?

33:20.456 --> 33:32.688
Well, because that's the highest honor that can be made to a person by a university.

33:32.708 --> 33:37.052
And I'm certainly not qualified

33:38.213 --> 33:43.339
intellectually for an honorary degree.

33:45.782 --> 33:50.007
I am not an intellectual, and I am not an academic.

33:50.808 --> 33:58.857
I'm certainly not quite a... But you're certainly a woman of extraordinary accomplishments.

33:59.518 --> 34:07.647
Well, and then the citation was done by Rudy Noonemacher, and I'm very proud of that, because it's a wonderful citation.

34:08.875 --> 34:23.457
And I think that, like Gaul, my life is divided in three parts, and the third part is class, and it's been a career and an eye-opener for me.

34:23.717 --> 34:32.310
The first two parts, just for clarification, being your childhood and adolescence, and the second part being... No, I would begin with my marriage.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.773
That's the first part.

34:34.694 --> 34:35.936
Really?

34:35.956 --> 34:38.219
So everything prior to that is prologue, in other words.

34:38.380 --> 34:38.680
Yes.

34:38.761 --> 34:42.586
and that's what I'm putting in my story from the Roman Academy.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.670
That is an introduction, a long introduction.

34:46.592 --> 34:51.498
And the first part is my life, my husband and my family.

34:51.578 --> 35:05.477
The second part is my life with the Norton Company, and those two overlap, because I was so much a part of that, and the travels that we've made all over the world, made friends all over the world, found that the Norton Company seemed to

35:08.292 --> 35:31.237
hire the best people in the narrowest sense of the word, not the most notorious or the most celebrated people, but the most substantial people in all their operations, wherever it was, whether it was in Montevideo or whether it was in Lima or whether it was in Bangkok or wherever.

35:31.778 --> 35:35.602
So there are a few places on this globe that Milton and I have not been.

35:36.603 --> 35:38.265
And I wondered,

35:38.633 --> 35:45.440
what my function was going to be, it wasn't to just go along, to be there while he was working.

35:46.220 --> 35:57.411
And the first trip that we made overseas was in 1950, 1949, when we went to South Africa on the second trip to Pan American Flea down there.

35:58.192 --> 36:05.199
And it was 51 hours flying time from New York to Johannesburg.

36:05.239 --> 36:08.202
And we've been nine times

36:08.435 --> 36:12.741
in South Africa in the course of the business, which has been fascinating.

36:13.883 --> 36:19.070
There's a woman there who was the wisest man who ran our plant when we built one there.

36:19.090 --> 36:29.084
My husband went down to make the decision as to whether or not to build a plant in 1949, and then he ended up buying diamonds for the company from the Diamond Center.

36:30.226 --> 36:33.430
But I wondered what I was going to do.

36:34.439 --> 36:39.824
And gradually it evolved that I really needed to keep track of the people that we met.

36:40.925 --> 36:42.447
I was entertained by the wives.

36:42.567 --> 36:43.528
I got to know them.

36:43.748 --> 37:03.788
I found out things through them that were helpful to him that I could pass on, such as when we were in India, that there was a group of women that Polly Cowan and I talked with, and he spent a day with them, and found that they were very unhappy.

37:04.460 --> 37:12.973
as wives of the Indians who were working in the Norton Company, because there wasn't a school that was suitable for their children.

37:13.033 --> 37:22.007
And they had to take a ferry and take their children for miles to go to a school, which taught the language, whether it was Urdu or Quart that they spoke, I don't know.

37:22.087 --> 37:26.734
So we passed this on to our husbands, who then would take some action on it.

37:27.174 --> 37:28.717
And that was one thing I did.

37:29.338 --> 37:32.222
Another thing that I did was we traveled so much

37:32.810 --> 37:38.055
South America that I learned to speak Spanish, and so that was helpful.

37:38.075 --> 37:45.321
Milton's greatest recreation has always been fishing, and we've fished in great many places all over the world.

37:45.882 --> 37:59.574
So we've had marvelous adventures in the places that we fished, notably in South America, where if I hadn't spoken Spanish, one of us hadn't, and I'm the one to do it, we would have missed a lot of things.

38:00.034 --> 38:01.956
We've made friends in

38:02.678 --> 38:03.939
Chile, particularly.

38:05.141 --> 38:15.593
And so then I thought it was nice of itself that we sent flowers to thank people that have entertained us and all that kind of thing.

38:15.613 --> 38:23.041
And along the way, I made some friends of a woman in South Africa, as I started to tell you, who still I consider one of my very best friends.

38:23.842 --> 38:28.247
And we see each other because we get to this country marvelously.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.692
So that was maybe the most exotic place that we went to.

38:33.773 --> 38:38.098
And again, just because this was part two of your life.

38:38.519 --> 38:40.141
This is part two of my life, yes.

38:40.221 --> 38:41.703
And then part three is Clark.

38:42.143 --> 38:48.391
But just because before we get to part three, you said you traveled virtually everywhere, I guess.

38:50.153 --> 38:50.233
Yes.

38:50.253 --> 38:54.859
We should point out that Martin Company had facilities.

38:55.345 --> 38:58.549
19 or 20 countries, I think it was, or all of them?

38:58.569 --> 38:59.310
Oh, I think at least.

38:59.910 --> 39:00.331
At least.

39:01.492 --> 39:02.613
I'd have to come to mind.

39:02.633 --> 39:03.214
That's fine.

39:03.234 --> 39:03.695
That's okay.

39:03.715 --> 39:14.827
But it did, and of course, beyond the excitement of the travel, and it must have just continued, the liberal education aspect is the park, I guess.

39:16.309 --> 39:18.872
But this certainly was an education of sorts for you, wasn't it?

39:19.409 --> 39:22.433
Oh yes, it's remarkable.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.377
That's the sun's bothering me.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.862
Not at all.

39:29.062 --> 39:40.718
These things, it's like the golden age of paraplegs that only lasted 50 years, and these only maybe lasted, you know, 15 or 20 or something like that.

39:41.218 --> 39:46.986
But all that living was packed into those, I think, three.

39:47.371 --> 40:16.669
let's then get to part three the Clark you point out in your essay that I don't know whether you came reluctantly to this which I guess you were invited to participate in the committee you said every one of which you resisted I guess every one of which you resisted I guess on the ground that perhaps you felt you weren't qualified but

40:17.273 --> 40:25.920
I can't remember what I said in that, but I finally said one day that one of the Bob Hyde was somebody who was a detective.

40:25.940 --> 40:27.582
I said it, but I went very closely with him.

40:27.622 --> 40:34.628
Another one was David Murphy, who wore a number of hats.

40:34.648 --> 40:38.811
But he was the one that was the staff man on the Goddard Library.

40:38.831 --> 40:46.538
And it was his idea, it was his brainstorm that got the result of industry names

40:46.923 --> 41:07.224
I don't know whether I said in that or not, but I didn't think I knew enough, but along the way, I finally said one day, I've been there about a year, and I said, I don't know enough to get a trustee.

41:07.244 --> 41:09.426
And David Murphy said, would you like to go back to school?

41:09.746 --> 41:10.988
Did I put that in the essay?

41:11.508 --> 41:14.071
Yes, well, that was very illuminating.

41:14.451 --> 41:16.373
That's something every trustee should have.

41:16.606 --> 41:32.164
That was something that a man can't do, because he hasn't usually, if he's a staff or person who's going to do us some good as a trustee, he's got to have experience, and he probably has a job that he's been working at, and he hasn't got the time.

41:32.264 --> 41:35.407
I had the time to do it, and that's how I did it.

41:35.448 --> 41:38.251
Then I thought I got to know something about what I was going to do.

41:38.271 --> 41:41.174
And I think you actually attended classes, you stayed in a class.

41:41.234 --> 41:42.075
Yes, I did some of them.

41:42.095 --> 41:45.499
I've done that right along, in various times.

41:45.783 --> 41:48.005
credits there in taking a tariff.

41:48.345 --> 41:50.347
So you actually attended classes for credit.

41:51.148 --> 41:52.429
That's not a new standard.

41:52.449 --> 41:53.029
No, I didn't.

41:53.690 --> 41:54.711
Not at cards.

41:54.731 --> 41:55.631
Can I put you some more classes?

41:55.792 --> 41:56.252
No, thank you.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.834
Help yourself, please.

41:59.475 --> 42:14.828
I took a French course at Desumption College for credit by mistake, when my mother-in-law, who had been fairly lately widowed, and she spoke very good French and very academic.

42:15.500 --> 42:24.972
And she was responsible for having me invited to the French Club, which I've enjoyed for a number of years in Worcester.

42:25.092 --> 42:26.834
But she didn't have anything to do.

42:26.914 --> 42:31.640
And I said to her, how would you like to take a course in some college?

42:32.201 --> 42:35.104
And we'll, you know, I'll do it with you.

42:35.124 --> 42:38.909
You know, I'll come and get you and take you a Tuesday's and Tuesday's night.

42:38.989 --> 42:40.351
But she thought she'd like to do that.

42:42.013 --> 42:43.735
So we went.

42:44.204 --> 42:55.939
signed up for this course together, and we found that we signed up to audited, I thought, and we found that we hadn't signed up for credit.

42:56.359 --> 42:59.944
So I said, well, why don't we take the exam?

42:59.964 --> 43:01.706
Why don't we go to the exam?

43:01.726 --> 43:02.407
We've had a good time.

43:02.427 --> 43:03.448
We said, we can do the exam.

43:04.129 --> 43:10.337
And I got a B plus, and she got an A minus, and I thought, that's great.

43:10.357 --> 43:11.298
It's marvelous.

43:11.318 --> 43:13.401
But she was urgent.

43:13.752 --> 43:14.733
grammar and all that.

43:14.853 --> 43:19.239
I can speak French just as fast as the French can speak it.

43:19.399 --> 43:20.560
But I can't read it right.

43:22.002 --> 43:23.303
I didn't spend the time on that.

43:23.323 --> 43:25.306
I wanted to learn to speak it.

43:25.326 --> 43:29.651
And I can understand them as all the practice they go to.

43:29.731 --> 43:38.081
So the important thing is you went out and became, you immersed yourself in the daily life of the university.

43:38.862 --> 43:41.565
Oh, yes, yes.

43:41.967 --> 43:48.093
Then every trustee—well, I had to know how to read a balance sheet.

43:48.213 --> 43:51.016
I'm not in the financial, not in it, but I was.

43:51.176 --> 43:56.041
And you mentioned that you learned a lot about bricks, as well, from the composition of them.

43:56.061 --> 43:57.883
Oh, yes, we did that, yes.

43:58.524 --> 44:00.566
But every trustee works.

44:00.686 --> 44:03.809
Every trustee is on three or four committees.

44:03.829 --> 44:11.637
And so I was asked if I would head the committee to plan the library, find an architect, build the library.

44:12.072 --> 44:23.467
And each time, partly because of Milton, I think, I took the job because I was talked into it by Bob Hyde.

44:24.288 --> 44:26.190
But they kind of ran it for me.

44:26.210 --> 44:28.393
It turned into a committee of about 20 people.

44:29.074 --> 44:32.899
And I said to him, there's too big a committee for us, it's unmanageable.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.762
He wanted to put somebody else on.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.245
He wanted to put Fred Howe on him.

44:36.265 --> 44:38.228
And I said, have I got a choice in this?

44:38.368 --> 44:40.431
I don't want him.

44:40.451 --> 44:42.354
And Bob talked me into that.

44:42.374 --> 44:51.588
He said, if we can interest him in this, he might be willing to help us financially, which is always a big consideration, certainly.

44:51.608 --> 44:52.830
A big consideration.

44:53.551 --> 45:01.063
So then I thought, the next thing I thought was, what I should do is to go and get a job as the librarian's assistant.

45:01.347 --> 45:03.190
until I learned what I'm talking about.

45:03.550 --> 45:04.371
I couldn't do that.

45:04.411 --> 45:06.474
I didn't have time to do that.

45:06.494 --> 45:12.202
So I hung on as best I could, and I learned a great deal from Tiltdown.

45:12.963 --> 45:20.755
I learned a great deal from Paul Clarkson, who was the first curator of special collections that Clark ever had.

45:20.775 --> 45:22.217
He reviewed books to me.

45:22.237 --> 45:23.799
Did he?

45:23.819 --> 45:23.939
Yes.

45:23.959 --> 45:26.022
And I took over the job at Book Ed.

45:28.752 --> 45:31.436
He was an interesting man.

45:31.636 --> 45:32.477
He was delightful.

45:33.599 --> 45:34.420
Yes, he was delightful.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.243
That was great fun.

45:36.263 --> 45:40.108
Then I got very immersed in the building of the library.

45:40.128 --> 45:53.808
We went to see 22, I think, lots of different objects, and we narrowed it down to eight or nine, and then to three or four, and we chose John Johansson because he'd never done a library before.

45:54.469 --> 45:57.173
But we had the Librarian of Harvard

45:57.878 --> 46:01.822
who you probably knew, as a consultant.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.623
And he was just like a praying mantis.

46:03.643 --> 46:07.427
He went over every book and every bookshelf and every inch.

46:08.187 --> 46:26.164
And he was the one that really put together a showpiece that the library is, which is what we wanted, and a dramatic building that was workable.

46:26.903 --> 46:28.625
And so that was a great promise.

46:28.925 --> 46:48.224
And then the next thing as we went along, we got this really—one subcontractor, it was a terribly complicated building, had a nervous breakdown over it because it was impossible to do some of the things the architect wanted to do.

46:49.205 --> 46:55.712
For instance, there's a—you go into the carols on the

46:57.076 --> 47:14.060
fifth floor, the fourth floor, on the side that looks over the garden, there is an angle on the room below that goes down like this, and they couldn't pour the concrete on that unless they got it.

47:14.441 --> 47:22.212
They were over and over and over in just the right sunlight exposure, just the right heat exposure, either it froze or it ran.

47:23.013 --> 47:25.176
And it was a lot of that kind of thing.

47:25.966 --> 47:31.275
The man who was the superintendent was a man named Ed Lucia.

47:32.357 --> 47:39.009
And Ed had a reputation of being an alcoholic and being very foul-mouthed.

47:40.051 --> 47:45.200
And I got the impression early on that I was being kept away from him.

47:46.042 --> 47:50.590
So I made an appointment and I went over and introduced myself to him in the library.

47:51.093 --> 47:53.916
We talked, and we got to be great friends.

47:54.036 --> 47:55.217
He's a wonderful man.

47:56.098 --> 47:58.400
L-U-C-I-E-I.

47:58.500 --> 48:01.503
I don't know if he's still alive.

48:01.543 --> 48:04.106
He used to talk about bringing up children.

48:05.267 --> 48:11.273
So the apprehension of other people was unfounded, apparently.

48:11.993 --> 48:17.078
Well, he probably cleaned up his back a bit, as far as I was concerned, and that's all right.

48:17.839 --> 48:20.982
But he said to me one day, he said,

48:21.940 --> 48:27.145
You know, Mr. Tiggins said, you from this roof is just fantastic.

48:27.185 --> 48:28.226
You've never seen anything like it.

48:28.606 --> 48:31.929
He said, someday, when it's a beautiful sunny day, he said, put on your pants.

48:31.949 --> 48:33.611
I said, excuse me, he said, I'll be here, pardon me.

48:34.212 --> 48:36.994
Just dress appropriately and I'll take you up on the roof.

48:37.595 --> 48:39.076
And I said, well, that would be wonderful.

48:39.477 --> 48:40.918
But how are we going to get there?

48:40.938 --> 48:47.644
Well, we said, we can, there are stairs that we can use, but they didn't use the stairs.

48:47.664 --> 48:51.508
They took everything up with a crane because they didn't want to.

48:51.758 --> 49:02.549
run the risk of damaging the stairwells or the elevators until they got to the top.

49:02.609 --> 49:06.313
And there was their four stories, and then there was the roof.

49:06.333 --> 49:12.058
And it's a box of books, as you know, and with the services on the outside.

49:12.899 --> 49:19.686
And from the fourth floor to the roof, there was a ladder that was at a 45-degree angle over four floors.

49:19.726 --> 49:21.748
It opened right to the bottom.

49:21.914 --> 49:24.036
And I am afraid to go up on the ladder.

49:24.357 --> 49:29.462
I can't get up on the ladder three steps to look for a bird's nest and stuff like that.

49:29.482 --> 49:33.507
But Ed Lucia said that was the way to get there, so I win.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.789
And my blood runs cold when I think of it.

49:36.270 --> 49:40.975
But I had to crawl up on that ladder, across that step, all alone.

49:41.175 --> 49:46.000
And all the time I was admiring the view, I was thinking that I had to go down on it again, but I made it.

49:46.761 --> 49:49.304
And I think I can go up on the ladder now.

49:49.904 --> 49:50.605
But I wasn't...

49:50.922 --> 49:52.584
I wasn't going to admit it to you.

49:52.604 --> 49:53.766
I wasn't going to tell anything.

49:54.026 --> 49:58.552
Now, you came to this, I guess, in 62, I believe it is?

49:58.572 --> 49:58.933
62.

49:59.533 --> 50:01.816
I guess about midlife, perhaps.

50:02.798 --> 50:04.240
Was it?

50:04.260 --> 50:05.842
Let's see how old I was.

50:06.382 --> 50:12.110
I was born in 96, so... How old was I?

50:12.731 --> 50:13.952
About 60?

50:13.992 --> 50:14.653
50-something.

50:14.673 --> 50:15.614
56, I guess.

50:15.635 --> 50:17.537
Yeah, I guess that.

50:20.723 --> 50:22.526
the creation of a library, I guess.

50:22.546 --> 50:23.007
Oh, no.

50:23.027 --> 50:30.979
And only— Your children were—you had other children with Mexican— Well, the youngest one was at Harvard.

50:31.940 --> 50:35.305
And I talked it over with the children before I took this job.

50:37.128 --> 50:41.515
But I didn't know how demanding it was going to be or how I'd get into it.

50:41.535 --> 50:45.581
But I'd often say to Milton, well, you worked terribly hard at that basis.

50:45.601 --> 50:49.347
I said, well, you'd be paying a psychiatrist before I was doing it.

50:49.478 --> 50:57.670
Did you do it as a project, or did you do it as a project for yourself, or did you see it as a contribution to a university?

50:58.010 --> 50:59.612
I saw things that needed to be done.

50:59.632 --> 51:13.292
And I think one of the things that I've been working on for a number of years in my mind, and I'm still going to go to work on it, is what is leadership, and is it something that can be taught?

51:13.993 --> 51:17.057
And I don't know that it can be, but the ingredients can be taught.

51:17.077 --> 51:19.080
This is where my thinking is at the moment.

51:19.668 --> 51:30.105
And I think one of the things is that if you, as leadership, you need to be able to see something that needs to be done.

51:30.505 --> 51:31.948
The campus looked terrible.

51:32.949 --> 51:34.992
And so I thought, well, what can I do about that?

51:35.093 --> 51:47.312
And I got together a group of women, including the president's wife, and I said, every Thursday morning we're going to go out here and we're going to weed this place and trim the things until we get it.

51:47.630 --> 51:48.711
Well, we're going to do it.

51:48.731 --> 51:49.552
What did you say?

51:49.612 --> 51:52.114
And we are going to do it as individuals.

51:52.134 --> 51:52.254
Yes.

51:52.274 --> 51:52.955
Will you do it?

51:53.656 --> 51:55.097
So they said yes.

51:55.197 --> 51:56.919
They were quite enthusiastic about it.

51:57.699 --> 52:04.166
And there was one gardener who didn't know anything about gardening, and he would rather ride around on the tracks or anything.

52:05.487 --> 52:10.532
So we went at this, and we did it bit by bit, piece by piece.

52:11.032 --> 52:16.337
Then we needed some shrubs to enhance the looks of the campus.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.863
We came and dug quite a lot of things off this place.

52:19.924 --> 52:25.330
And we had a very good gardener here, our own gardener who helped things a lot with it.

52:25.530 --> 52:27.312
And we transplanted things.

52:27.372 --> 52:34.821
We found places where we'd go and buy things cheaply, like azaleas, that we could dig up ourselves and then come and dig the holes and put them in.

52:35.682 --> 52:37.704
The faculty would come out and work with us.

52:38.185 --> 52:41.569
Paul Clarkson used to come every Thursday and help in his noon hour.

52:42.430 --> 52:44.552
And when whoever was there that was helping,

52:44.785 --> 52:51.079
But it got to be noon, then I would go and get some sandwiches and some thing to drink, and we'd sit down and have a picnic.

52:51.099 --> 52:54.347
So you set the example, and... But it was fun.

52:55.349 --> 53:01.663
And one of the offshoots was that... So, pardon me, before you get to the offshoots, but what is the...

53:04.462 --> 53:06.905
That needed to be done.

53:06.925 --> 53:08.967
And you take the initiative to start it.

53:08.987 --> 53:10.449
Who was going to do it, yes.

53:10.769 --> 53:14.754
And you get down on your hands and knees and start digging the first hole, I guess.

53:14.914 --> 53:17.897
Yes, if you like, yes.

53:18.878 --> 53:33.675
Okay, and then the offshoot that you were just about to... The offshoot was a lot of the faculty, and Clark has a very independent faculty, very independent, I think more than most faculty.

53:33.875 --> 53:36.959
and also a fairly loyal faculty.

53:36.979 --> 53:46.430
Of course, it's very much changed in these years because there's a lot of younger people and a lot of the people that I worked with retired and died.

53:48.052 --> 53:52.657
But there were troublemakers, as there always are.

53:53.338 --> 53:57.824
And they'd come across the campus, and then they'd see me, and they'd stop and talk.

53:57.984 --> 53:59.586
And I got to know them that way.

54:00.106 --> 54:03.190
Once in a while, there's like Saul Cullen, for instance,

54:03.625 --> 54:21.733
like to sit down and talk, and he'd have some complaints of one kind and another, or perhaps it was somebody else who was—don't call him as a brilliant man, but if he had ever become president of Clark University, it would have been a very different school.

54:21.753 --> 54:25.198
And I didn't want that, and neither did the trustees.

54:27.061 --> 54:31.708
So we had a few narrow weeks along the way.

54:32.009 --> 54:41.038
But I had an opportunity to say to the faculty member, this is not the kind of thing you can discuss for the trustee, or you should be discussing the trustee.

54:41.599 --> 54:45.763
This is the running of the university.

54:45.823 --> 54:54.772
We are in an advisory capacity, and we cannot interfere with the day-to-day running of the university.

54:55.332 --> 54:57.294
That is the president's responsibility.

54:57.655 --> 55:00.818
And if you feel that way about this, you go and talk to the president about it.

55:01.372 --> 55:12.325
And I would almost always tell the president about these conversations, editing them somewhat, because some of them were very critical of some of the presidents, really, very outspoken.

55:13.026 --> 55:20.194
But I feel that I found that I could serve as a mediator of some of these things, and that was useful.

55:21.135 --> 55:27.302
And I felt that actually, in some of these confrontations, I almost always ended up on the back of the side.

55:28.624 --> 55:31.227
At what point, through your service on

55:31.848 --> 55:44.701
the succession of committees and buildings starting to go up, did you start to feel a sense of satisfaction and a personal satisfaction in the conference?

55:44.721 --> 55:49.887
I wonder, or was there just too much to do to feel that while it was in progress?

55:50.027 --> 55:55.392
I'm looking for a personal reaction to a response, I guess.

55:55.412 --> 55:57.214
I don't think I ever thought about it.

55:57.886 --> 55:58.727
that way.

55:58.867 --> 56:15.629
I think that it was about halfway through my, when we were close to the finishing of the library, I began to peel my oats a little bit and I began to have the courage to make some decisions that I felt I could, as I told Dave Murphy, I'm going to throw my weight around on this one.

56:15.649 --> 56:20.755
They're not going to take down that tower and put up this water struck brick that they

56:21.190 --> 56:23.032
The library is made up.

56:23.052 --> 56:25.135
It's too expensive, and it's not important enough.

56:25.155 --> 56:26.877
It grows ivy on it anyway.

56:26.897 --> 56:27.517
But that's that.

56:27.598 --> 56:30.441
I don't want to hear any more about it.

56:30.461 --> 56:33.785
So we wouldn't even bring up some of those things.

56:33.825 --> 56:34.846
It seems self-evident.

56:34.906 --> 56:36.608
They wouldn't bring up some of those.

56:36.628 --> 56:39.672
They wouldn't bring up some of those.

56:39.692 --> 56:41.614
I suspect they knew your position, perhaps.

56:41.834 --> 56:45.118
Well, we would discuss most of the things in the committee.

56:46.199 --> 56:51.045
And we did that when we were looking for presidents.

56:51.228 --> 56:53.431
six presidents and one acting president.

56:53.451 --> 56:55.995
We knew a revolving doorless president, Clark.

56:56.937 --> 57:05.870
We had eight—he had four presidents in the first 80 years, Clark's history, and eight presidents in four years.

57:06.551 --> 57:07.873
Something like that.

57:08.114 --> 57:08.835
Amazing.

57:08.855 --> 57:10.177
Well, it is amazing.

57:10.197 --> 57:13.642
All of them left for very different reasons.

57:13.662 --> 57:15.325
It was fascinating.

57:15.345 --> 57:16.847
Did you consider yourself—

57:18.447 --> 57:24.339
Democratic in your dealings with the other members of the trustees?

57:27.005 --> 57:37.367
Because you mentioned leadership earlier, and I think leadership suggests that somebody has to get out front and point the way.

57:37.820 --> 57:43.492
No, well, I've never thought of it that way at all, and I still don't think about it.

57:43.552 --> 57:47.821
I remember Bob Hyde... I mean, you weren't the Iron Lady, so to speak, were you?

57:47.841 --> 57:53.032
Well, I don't think I made as many enemies as she has.

57:53.092 --> 57:53.974
I might say that.

57:54.655 --> 57:58.022
But I remember Bob Hyde saying to me one day,

57:58.306 --> 58:03.914
You know, as your leadership in this university has been so strong that thus and so on, I thought, what is she talking about?

58:04.375 --> 58:07.560
I've just been, you know, doing what needed to be done.

58:07.600 --> 58:19.939
I don't think I ever thought about that, except when we began to look for presidents, I was determined that we weren't going to take a vote on anything if we could help it.

58:20.039 --> 58:26.068
We were going to reach consensus every step of the way which we did, I think.

58:27.905 --> 58:30.569
Well, I think that's another emolument of leadership, isn't it?

58:31.069 --> 58:31.910
Yes, I think so.

58:32.211 --> 58:32.651
I think so.

58:32.671 --> 58:36.016
To lead people to consensus.

58:36.036 --> 58:46.410
And I remember one of the faculty members that I was very fond of, Roy Anderson, saying to me one day, Alice, you were in that meeting, which was, I guess, a hot and heavy one.

58:46.430 --> 58:48.492
He said, you didn't say much of anything.

58:48.532 --> 58:49.894
You talked the least of anybody.

58:50.515 --> 58:53.439
I said, I could see it was coming out the way I wanted to.

58:53.479 --> 58:56.203
I think he wanted to come on us.

58:56.283 --> 58:56.443
He said,

58:56.795 --> 58:59.519
I didn't need to say anything.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.724
I guess I asked a question about satisfaction.

59:02.784 --> 59:05.548
You said you didn't have time to think about it.

59:05.628 --> 59:07.451
I mean, because there were jobs to be done.

59:07.771 --> 59:13.299
And did you see this as a—now, this was, again, the third phase of your life.

59:13.459 --> 59:23.013
Was there a project that you felt that you needed now that the children are growing, your youngest child was in Harvard, you mentioned?

59:23.915 --> 59:24.616
Well, I don't know.

59:24.636 --> 59:25.637
It fell into my lap.

59:25.904 --> 59:31.951
I don't know what I would—I would have had to do something otherwise, but I don't know what it would have been.

59:31.991 --> 59:38.018
I didn't have any idea that I could take a job with a trustee.

59:39.019 --> 59:40.941
So that was a lot of my advice.

59:41.041 --> 59:43.224
And I think maybe it's true of most people.

59:43.244 --> 59:44.465
It's serendipitous.

59:45.587 --> 59:48.110
And I think that's what that was for me.

59:48.830 --> 59:54.477
I do remember talking to a group of faculty one day about something.

59:54.997 --> 59:58.342
One of them said, you're a terribly hard worker.

59:58.362 --> 01:00:00.946
And Cy Watner said, yes, and she enjoys every minute of it.

01:00:01.426 --> 01:00:02.128
And that's true.

01:00:02.168 --> 01:00:03.570
That was true.

01:00:04.651 --> 01:00:09.358
It's funny that you said, somebody reflected on one of the meetings where you hadn't said anything.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.343
You said, well, I could see where it was going, and it was going in the right direction.

01:00:12.783 --> 01:00:17.410
Interestingly enough, in your essay, you say one thing you have to learn is how to listen.

01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:27.276
a lot harder to listen and to pay attention to what people are saying.

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:31.180
I think that's kind of a corollary to what you were just saying there.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:35.005
Do you see a fourth phase of your life?

01:00:36.406 --> 01:00:37.247
Probably, no.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.351
I can't think of that.

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:45.056
I'm 87 years old.

01:00:45.136 --> 01:00:46.018
Milton is 90.

01:00:46.538 --> 01:00:52.425
All I'm trying to do is to see to it that I've yet him through the end of his life, really.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:56.325
And it's not easy, some of it.

01:00:56.465 --> 01:01:04.636
So I don't, I miss being on the campus, and I do keep in touch, and I do do some fundraising.

01:01:06.117 --> 01:01:10.343
I want to go back to the library for a minute.

01:01:10.363 --> 01:01:19.594
We've chosen architects, and then we've had, having gone through all that space of it,

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:23.981
And then we worked with the architect to build the library.

01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:29.648
And then I was asked to head up the fundraising part of it.

01:01:29.688 --> 01:01:32.292
And Milton said to me, that's something you're not going to do.

01:01:32.412 --> 01:01:33.493
Somebody else can do that.

01:01:33.894 --> 01:01:36.937
You don't know anything about fundraising, and you're not going to do it.

01:01:37.838 --> 01:01:42.604
And so I came home, and I said, Milton, there isn't anybody else that's willing to do it.

01:01:42.684 --> 01:01:45.227
I'm willing to do it, and I'm going to try and see what I can do.

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.771
Well, then I got hooked on fundraising.

01:01:47.911 --> 01:01:49.733
I met some fascinating people.

01:01:50.422 --> 01:01:52.645
And I think I may be closer to this.

01:01:53.846 --> 01:02:11.947
I had some experience with it, with foundations, that the people of whom I was in awe, that it was so bizarre that I thought if I wrote these up for the New Yorker, if I could do that, I'd make more money for clocks than I'm getting them from the circuit, acting for it.

01:02:12.307 --> 01:02:15.711
Incredible, just incredible what happened.

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:17.153
It was full of excitement and adventure.

01:02:17.173 --> 01:02:18.775
So you enjoyed the fundraising?

01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:22.218
You surprised yourself by enjoying this one.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:22.738
Yes, yes.

01:02:22.918 --> 01:02:23.739
I do enjoy it.

01:02:25.401 --> 01:02:28.705
Apparently you learned some things about human nature, I guess.

01:02:28.825 --> 01:02:29.306
A lot.

01:02:30.027 --> 01:02:30.427
A lot.

01:02:30.487 --> 01:02:44.002
And then one thing that was fun about it was I found on the first one that I went and did by myself, without a staff person with me, was General Foods.

01:02:44.022 --> 01:02:48.087
And they were an organization that didn't...
