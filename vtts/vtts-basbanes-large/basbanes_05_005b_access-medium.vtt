WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:05.848
And we're rolling, and we're talking to Judith Guest.

00:05.928 --> 00:08.291
And this book, I guess, is 10 years in the making.

00:08.351 --> 00:08.852
Is that right?

00:09.172 --> 00:10.875
Yeah, I quit counting it 10 years.

00:12.036 --> 00:16.803
Mine took eight, so I'm sympathetic.

00:16.983 --> 00:22.811
Somebody I was talking to just the other day said, well, hey, you were working on it back in Dutada.

00:22.891 --> 00:25.274
And I thought, ooh, that's more than 10 years ago.

00:25.675 --> 00:26.396
Now, why 10?

00:26.556 --> 00:28.078
I mean, why so long, let's say?

00:28.098 --> 00:29.700
Well, you know, it's...

00:30.659 --> 00:33.983
It's basically the story of my grandparents.

00:34.363 --> 00:37.988
And so it's a family, it's partly a family history.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.972
And I think I was kind of intimidated by it.

00:42.653 --> 00:45.056
Just trying to get things just right.

00:46.037 --> 00:47.959
You know, and I do that all the time.

00:48.019 --> 00:52.965
And then I always end up reminding myself, hey, there is no right.

00:52.985 --> 00:54.327
This is just subjective.

00:55.107 --> 00:59.012
Anybody else in this family who wrote this book would write it

00:59.684 --> 01:01.896
probably a lot differently than I would write it.

01:03.022 --> 01:06.842
But it's like a lesson you have to keep learning over and over and over again.

01:07.396 --> 01:14.286
Even though, as I do understand, it is inspired by a family experience, your grandparents, I guess.

01:14.307 --> 01:14.727
Is that right?

01:15.028 --> 01:15.669
Yeah.

01:15.689 --> 01:16.770
It's a novel, though.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.593
But that's, of course, that's where I'm going.

01:18.653 --> 01:20.155
Next point.

01:20.296 --> 01:23.541
The fact that it's inspired, I mean, it still is a novel.

01:23.641 --> 01:24.081
It is.

01:24.101 --> 01:25.844
And you felt free to invent, I assume.

01:26.044 --> 01:26.745
Yes, I did.

01:26.866 --> 01:31.232
But I think I feel a lot freer to invent when I know it's a novel.

01:31.933 --> 01:36.340
And when half of me is saying, yeah, but this really happened,

01:36.927 --> 01:38.811
It makes it a lot harder.

01:39.693 --> 01:45.665
And I don't even know if it was the hardness of it that made it take so long.

01:45.785 --> 01:48.932
I think it's more, it had something to do with commitment.

01:49.172 --> 01:52.118
I think I was really scared to commit to it.

01:52.756 --> 01:55.419
It just seemed like it was so important to me.

01:56.660 --> 02:07.253
You know, I mean, so many authors I've talked to over the years, and they all say, you know, when you write about yourself or your own family, you are laying yourself naked before the world.

02:07.373 --> 02:09.535
And do you feel similarly?

02:11.017 --> 02:17.284
I'm exposing things that maybe that might, that other members of the family might be sensitive about your writing about.

02:17.324 --> 02:19.827
No, that doesn't really...

02:20.836 --> 02:46.067
do it for me. I've tried to figure that out myself, what it is. It's more of an internal thing I think. It's not so much that I'm thinking oh I better not write about this because you know they might be upset. I didn't and I don't think that now. I don't think that any anybody in my family is going to read that book and be upset about anything that's in it. In fact I'm sure of it, but um

02:47.380 --> 02:52.726
It's your relationship to the work, I think, that is in peril all the time.

02:53.527 --> 02:57.411
And are you doing this story justice?

02:57.491 --> 02:59.573
Are you telling it right?

03:00.695 --> 03:04.439
Are you making things up that didn't really happen?

03:04.499 --> 03:08.123
Which, of course, as soon as it becomes a novel, you are doing.

03:08.303 --> 03:09.184
And you have to do.

03:09.564 --> 03:14.850
And in fact, the last year of writing, I spent editing out.

03:15.291 --> 03:17.353
And I cut out 100 pages.

03:17.570 --> 03:17.991
Really?

03:18.031 --> 03:18.712
Last year.

03:18.852 --> 03:19.793
Manuscript pages.

03:19.813 --> 03:21.195
Yeah.

03:21.656 --> 03:22.717
That's tough, isn't it?

03:22.737 --> 03:26.262
It's all stuff that I had to keep telling myself.

03:26.302 --> 03:29.647
My husband gave me the little talisman.

03:30.147 --> 03:35.315
He said, just because it happened doesn't mean you've got to put it in the book.

03:35.335 --> 03:36.456
I know.

03:36.877 --> 03:42.925
Every time I'd come to something and it wasn't quite working, I'd say that, and I'd say, yep, I like this piece.

03:42.965 --> 03:46.530
This is important to me personally, but it doesn't do anything to

03:46.797 --> 03:48.740
to advance the plot of the book.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.501
That's right.

03:49.521 --> 03:53.026
That's the fundamental leap from the nonfiction writer to the fiction writer.

03:53.126 --> 03:53.467
Right, exactly.

03:53.747 --> 04:01.219
And it's very hard to make when you do feel so much that you're telling a family story.

04:01.379 --> 04:02.420
It's very hard to do.

04:02.681 --> 04:05.385
I mean, the stuff seems like it's set in cement, you know?

04:05.405 --> 04:09.571
Now, when you say a family story, are you talking generically or are you talking about your own family or both?

04:11.494 --> 04:13.076
Because you do write family stories.

04:13.196 --> 04:14.338
I'm talking both.

04:14.619 --> 04:14.779
Yeah.

04:14.919 --> 04:16.281
But, yeah, I am talking,

04:16.615 --> 04:40.800
generically, I'm talking about my family. Why this novel was so much harder than any other novel that I've written? But I mean you also write family stories in a generic sense I guess is what I'm saying. Yeah yeah. What I'm doing is what I'm doing is seguing into another area. It's the only thing I'm interested in writing about, and it's probably and it's the only thing I ever will be interested in writing. And why is that?

04:41.472 --> 05:03.649
Why is that? That's simple he asked. It's the only thing that I'm interested in. He said that? But I have to believe you're interested in other things. I mean as soon as I say that, I think yeah but I wrote a mystery novel but I did write a mystery novel with with my friend Rebecca Hill um but it was also a family story. I mean it was about a family

05:05.080 --> 05:05.541
I don't know.

05:05.882 --> 05:09.389
No, I guess I've got to say it is about the only thing that I'm interested in.

05:09.749 --> 05:23.476
Well, no, you certainly had the family here when you began, and, you know, your reviewers do point out that you are, they suggest that you are a character-driven novelist.

05:23.516 --> 05:24.338
Would you agree with that?

05:24.993 --> 05:29.500
So did you start here with the characters or with the concept and the premise?

05:29.800 --> 05:36.731
Well, you know, I've had that question asked to me before about all of my novels, and I never know how to answer that.

05:36.891 --> 05:38.734
It isn't an either-or thing.

05:40.136 --> 05:40.797
So what happens?

05:40.857 --> 05:44.002
I start with the characters, but the characters aren't just in a vacuum.

05:44.022 --> 05:46.946
They're doing something, and something has happened to them.

05:46.966 --> 05:49.350
And so it seems like it all comes at once.

05:49.890 --> 05:52.975
Well, I mean, do you have a sense of story when you start?

05:53.191 --> 05:59.127
Yeah, I do have a sense of story and I often have a sense of ending of story.

05:59.147 --> 06:04.923
And sometimes that ending stays and sometimes it doesn't.

06:04.943 --> 06:08.533
And as you've pointed out in other interviews, these things take on life of their own.

06:08.851 --> 06:09.892
Well, yeah, they better.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.858
I mean, they certainly develop their own energy.

06:13.918 --> 06:14.579
I mean, they go big.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.081
And that's true.

06:16.161 --> 06:19.125
I mean, you know, I've interviewed a thousand authors.

06:19.486 --> 06:21.889
That's not an exaggerated number over the last 20 years.

06:21.949 --> 06:28.258
And then having done my own book, it's these things go where they want to go.

06:28.598 --> 06:28.698
Yeah.

06:28.718 --> 06:30.100
And, you know, and I've read.

06:30.248 --> 06:34.332
I've read interviews where people have said, oh, that's just crazy.

06:34.672 --> 06:35.373
You're the boss.

06:35.413 --> 06:36.174
You're in charge.

06:36.194 --> 06:36.554
It's not true.

06:36.574 --> 06:37.655
You're able to do what you want to do.

06:37.715 --> 06:40.698
And I think, boy, that sure ain't the way it works for me.

06:40.718 --> 06:47.244
Yeah, well, my book was 638 pages, 250,000 words, and I didn't have an outline for it.

06:47.585 --> 06:48.105
Uh-huh.

06:48.125 --> 06:51.889
You know, I mean, you have general areas, but the thing goes.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.130
Yeah, right.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.472
No, I don't work from an outline either.

06:55.712 --> 06:59.496
I mean, I feel like if I worked from an outline, I wouldn't even have to write it.

06:59.746 --> 07:01.989
If I had it all outlined and I knew where it was going.

07:02.310 --> 07:03.071
Then it's not fun.

07:03.391 --> 07:04.293
Then you're not interested.

07:04.413 --> 07:07.998
It would just be, okay, today I get up and do this, this, and this.

07:08.058 --> 07:12.124
I mean, part of the fun is sitting there wondering where you're going to go today.

07:13.226 --> 07:19.876
Is this, you mentioned that the only subjects that interest you as a novelist are families, domestic relationships.

07:20.196 --> 07:23.101
So therefore it's a corpus then, isn't it, what you've done?

07:24.643 --> 07:25.264
They're all popular.

07:26.037 --> 07:30.183
Part of the same story, only with looking at it from different sides.

07:30.203 --> 07:30.543
Right.

07:31.084 --> 07:31.565
Is that fair?

07:32.085 --> 07:32.987
Yeah, that is fair.

07:33.107 --> 07:38.654
And as my friend Rebecca said about our mystery novel, well, we're just working the other side of the street here.

07:40.297 --> 07:41.959
She said the funniest thing to me.

07:41.979 --> 07:45.103
She said, you know, because she's a novelist, too.

07:45.323 --> 07:53.074
And she said, normally what we're doing when we're writing a regular novel is we're looking for every avenue where people...

07:53.628 --> 07:56.854
can solve their problems short of murder.

07:57.896 --> 08:00.501
And she said, in this novel, we're going right to the whip.

08:03.046 --> 08:07.094
Now, I have quite a few papers in the Midwest, I should point out, that take my stuff.

08:08.677 --> 08:13.847
Grand Rapids takes me, Toledo takes me, Des Moines, Wichita...

08:13.827 --> 08:18.934
And so I just jump when I have an opportunity to do a Midwestern novelist, a writer.

08:19.635 --> 08:24.682
Would you categorize yourself as a Midwestern novelist?

08:24.702 --> 08:28.267
Do you come out of any kind of regional tradition, do you think?

08:30.330 --> 08:31.932
I don't know what regional tradition means.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.016
But yeah, I'm a Midwestern novelist.

08:35.076 --> 08:35.757
I live in the Midwest.

08:35.777 --> 08:37.399
Well, I mean, of course, that's where you live.

08:37.419 --> 08:40.223
But I mean, in terms of...

08:40.574 --> 08:43.399
How important is place, for instance?

08:43.439 --> 08:47.347
Well, you know, actually, I think place is pretty important, and it's very important in this novel.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.773
I mean, you had to have that setting, certainly.

08:50.813 --> 08:52.877
Well, I did, yeah.

08:53.058 --> 08:58.328
And it's the setting that I know best, and it's the setting that I love best.

08:59.189 --> 09:03.898
And actually, a lot of that hundred pages that came out was...

09:04.503 --> 09:24.402
was placed even though I think I left a lot in I took a lot out and I realized it was sort of self-indulgent it was like yeah but I've been there and it's beautiful and I want to describe it and I want to go there again in my writing and so I would say yeah I guess I am

09:24.888 --> 09:26.251
I guess I am a regional writer.

09:26.271 --> 09:27.954
Now, tell me about your accent.

09:27.974 --> 09:30.499
It almost sounds a little Chicago-y.

09:30.599 --> 09:31.881
Or is that a Michigan accent?

09:32.382 --> 09:33.444
I grew up in Detroit.

09:33.464 --> 09:34.366
Okay.

09:34.386 --> 09:35.408
I lived in Chicago.

09:35.668 --> 09:35.989
You did?

09:36.049 --> 09:37.151
Yeah.

09:37.171 --> 09:37.752
All right.

09:37.812 --> 09:43.563
I was living in Chicago when I wrote Ordinary People.

09:43.904 --> 09:44.044
Mm-hmm.

09:44.834 --> 09:51.523
You know, so many of my readers, I'd love to tell the story of how ordinary people came to be again.

09:51.544 --> 09:58.273
I certainly won't dwell on it to any great length, but it is a pretty remarkable publishing story, isn't it?

09:58.453 --> 09:59.475
It really is.

09:59.495 --> 10:01.458
Could you just, if you have a few minutes to read?

10:01.478 --> 10:05.844
The most remarkable thing about it is that I didn't realize at the time how remarkable it was.

10:05.904 --> 10:07.927
I mean, books do not sell over the transom.

10:07.947 --> 10:08.588
You know that, right?

10:09.409 --> 10:13.074
Well, I had a great editor, and she was a junior editor at the time.

10:13.154 --> 10:13.795
Who was she?

10:14.247 --> 10:20.195
Her name was Mimi Jones, and she was a good editor.

10:20.215 --> 10:21.236
This was at Viking, right?

10:21.256 --> 10:22.037
Yeah, this was at Viking.

10:22.698 --> 10:25.041
And she really helped me after they bought it.

10:25.181 --> 10:26.282
She really helped me.

10:26.302 --> 10:28.926
Now, did you just send it to whom it made concern?

10:29.146 --> 10:29.767
Yeah, I did.

10:29.787 --> 10:30.728
You didn't even have a name?

10:31.229 --> 10:33.011
No, not for that one.

10:34.052 --> 10:35.254
They were the third publisher.

10:36.115 --> 10:39.579
And the first publisher, I didn't have a name.

10:40.861 --> 10:43.444
The second publisher, I did have a name.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.453
And they said, nah, we don't like this.

10:48.615 --> 10:52.361
And so the third one, no, I just... Actually, the third one, you know what I did?

10:52.422 --> 11:01.497
I just looked in my bookcase and looked at all the books that I had and who published the ones I liked the best.

11:01.517 --> 11:04.642
So which Viking books impressed you?

11:04.662 --> 11:08.368
There were a lot of Viking books there, and I thought, well, maybe this is like horse racing.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.129
I like them, so maybe they'll like me.

11:12.149 --> 11:22.683
And then Mimi read it and liked it a lot and wrote me a very cautious letter about it about five months before they even bought it.

11:23.343 --> 11:24.705
And for five months.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.789
So how long did the dance go on for about a year?

11:28.790 --> 11:29.251
Eight months.

11:29.311 --> 11:29.972
Eight months.

11:29.992 --> 11:30.993
Eight months before they bought it.

11:31.974 --> 11:38.322
But for five months, she just went on a campaign to get some other editors to read it.

11:39.095 --> 11:39.536
Jeez.

11:40.017 --> 11:41.259
And she finally did it.

11:41.459 --> 11:51.317
So, I mean, she was a good editor, but if she were less forceful and less aggressive, you know, it could have... Today, junior editors don't even have that much clout.

11:51.337 --> 11:51.437
Yeah.

11:51.457 --> 11:55.004
You know, my book, it took 13 months to sell it.

11:55.224 --> 11:55.985
Holt bought it.

11:56.526 --> 11:58.049
I was orphaned at Random House.

11:58.830 --> 12:02.537
The worst thing that could ever befall a writer, as you probably have heard, you know.

12:03.361 --> 12:04.804
Were you at Random House?

12:05.024 --> 12:05.445
I'm sorry?

12:05.885 --> 12:06.887
What did you say?

12:06.987 --> 12:10.093
My book had originally been under contract at Random House.

12:10.393 --> 12:10.854
Oh, really?

12:11.656 --> 12:12.978
And, oh, it's a great story.

12:13.098 --> 12:16.344
I mean, and then my editor left and went to another house.

12:16.504 --> 12:18.467
Oh, that's the worst.

12:18.548 --> 12:19.289
It's the worst.

12:19.409 --> 12:19.670
I know.

12:19.710 --> 12:22.535
I've got friends here who that's happened to.

12:22.555 --> 12:23.256
It's terrible.

12:23.556 --> 12:24.398
It's disastrous.

12:24.418 --> 12:28.525
And then it came at a time when, I'm going to shut off the tape because I want to transmit it.

12:30.142 --> 12:31.604
But so anyway, you said this.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.588
Now, how old were you when this was?

12:33.608 --> 12:35.812
40.

12:36.032 --> 12:37.334
I was 40 when it was published.

12:37.354 --> 12:37.955
You were 40?

12:38.055 --> 12:38.837
Yeah.

12:38.857 --> 12:42.904
And so, I mean, you weren't some starry-eyed young kid who said, I think I'll write a novel now.

12:42.964 --> 12:45.147
No, and that was very helpful.

12:45.849 --> 12:50.637
Because what happened afterwards would be enough to, like, seek you if you were in your 20s.

12:50.717 --> 12:50.817
Yeah.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.585
It's pretty scary stuff.

12:53.946 --> 13:00.772
And when it finally was purchased, did you expect the kind that became, what, a five-month New York Times bestseller?

13:00.792 --> 13:02.454
Yeah, uh-huh.

13:02.794 --> 13:04.315
Well, that's what was fun about it.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.397
I didn't expect anything.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.578
I didn't know what to expect.

13:07.879 --> 13:12.683
So everything that happened was like, whoa, another Christmas present in July.

13:14.405 --> 13:15.606
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

13:15.706 --> 13:17.648
And then, of course, when Redford...

13:17.830 --> 13:21.434
Redford called and said, I would like to buy this book.

13:21.474 --> 13:22.014
He called you?

13:22.915 --> 13:25.118
Did he call you?

13:26.059 --> 13:27.120
He called Viking.

13:27.200 --> 13:27.861
Oh, that's great.

13:28.001 --> 13:29.262
Yes, then he did call me.

13:29.763 --> 13:31.585
He did call me, and I didn't believe it was him.

13:32.205 --> 13:35.168
My brothers are always calling me up and stuff like that.

13:35.809 --> 13:36.770
That's a great story.

13:37.130 --> 13:37.951
Hello, Judith.

13:37.971 --> 13:38.872
This is Robert Redford.

13:38.892 --> 13:39.873
I go, yeah, sure.

13:39.893 --> 13:40.854
Yeah, right.

13:40.874 --> 13:41.475
Right.

13:42.012 --> 13:44.317
Well, I got a call a year ago this week.

13:44.918 --> 13:48.526
It was from the Boston Globe, and I thought they were trying to sell me a subscription, you know.

13:48.546 --> 13:50.891
I said, what are you calling me on a Sunday night for?

13:50.971 --> 13:53.015
She said, we want to comment.

13:53.035 --> 13:56.663
Your book has just been nominated for National Book Riddick Circle.

13:58.398 --> 14:00.741
My voice went up two octaves, you know.

14:01.081 --> 14:01.722
Oh, really?

14:01.742 --> 14:07.869
I love that when it happens.

14:08.249 --> 14:09.571
I love the title, errands.

14:10.091 --> 14:13.495
Oh, God, I love to hear that when someone says that.

14:13.555 --> 14:15.898
And you even gave us an epigraph to explain it.

14:16.218 --> 14:18.441
Yeah, well... How often do you see that in a novel, you know?

14:18.461 --> 14:24.728
I get to do that because some people at Valentine didn't like the title, and they wanted me to change it.

14:25.209 --> 14:28.152
And it's the same thing that happened to me with ordinary people, so...

14:28.317 --> 14:33.885
Then I have to scramble and explain why, no, actually this is a great title.

14:34.265 --> 14:36.608
Yeah, well, so maybe explain it for me.

14:36.628 --> 14:40.373
I have your explanation, but when did you have the title?

14:40.834 --> 14:42.236
Oh, really early on.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.858
Really early on.

14:44.139 --> 14:45.360
And it just felt right.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.423
And, you know, that's the difficulty.

14:47.443 --> 14:49.746
I don't think I can explain it exactly.

14:50.107 --> 14:53.431
But I knew that was the right title for this book.

14:53.531 --> 14:56.215
And I think it's partly that...

14:56.465 --> 15:13.949
errands seem to be a woman's task, and it's a huge part of your life, and that if you treat them sort of... If you treat them like, oh, man, I've got to get these errands done, and then I can live my life, you're sort of chucking a large part of your life.

15:14.971 --> 15:20.358
And so to me, they seem sort of like, hey, you've got to get a lot of mileage out of these things.

15:20.558 --> 15:23.282
There has to be like a spiritual...

15:24.123 --> 15:26.546
doing, that you really are.

15:26.566 --> 15:28.749
It's gifts that you're giving people.

15:28.769 --> 15:31.152
And I don't know.

15:31.793 --> 15:37.901
Well, I had never heard of the concept of errand as a, you know, I just thought it was something you had to do.

15:38.141 --> 15:41.766
I mean, I never thought of it in terms of this noble thing.

15:42.026 --> 15:46.392
Yeah, well, but I think in the larger sense, it really is.

15:46.432 --> 15:48.735
It's a huge part of a lot of people's lives.

15:49.556 --> 15:51.919
And it's important things that you do for people.

15:52.237 --> 15:53.199
And for yourself.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.167
And that you should kind of be in the moment with them instead of, like, rushing through them.

15:58.929 --> 16:03.176
And plus, then I think about what happens to me when I'm running errands.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.018
I'm meeting people.

16:04.318 --> 16:05.741
I'm talking to clerks.

16:06.482 --> 16:12.112
I'm interacting with the rest of the people.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.937
It seems like it makes you feel...

16:15.305 --> 16:44.822
closer to people but it takes on a higher resonance though I mean it becomes much more than I really do believe this and yet whenever I talk about it it always sounds kind of corny and soupy but so what I mean it's the truth you mentioned that errands usually fall to women do you think that your primary reader is a woman do you have a sense of your reader when you're at all

16:45.595 --> 16:50.842
Yeah, I think my primary reader is a woman, but yeah, yes, I do.

16:51.263 --> 16:55.850
But I also think that a lot of men read fiction, too.

16:57.231 --> 16:57.973
God, I hope so.

16:58.153 --> 16:59.194
And a lot of men don't.

16:59.995 --> 17:00.817
A lot of men don't.

17:01.277 --> 17:03.721
Right now, all men are thinking about the football games this weekend.

17:03.741 --> 17:05.944
Oh, well, it didn't really happen, so why should I read about it?

17:06.585 --> 17:09.128
Doesn't that drive you nuts when you hear that?

17:09.148 --> 17:11.351
Yeah, it does.

17:11.412 --> 17:14.556
Especially it drives me nuts when an interviewer says it.

17:14.840 --> 17:18.647
They do.

17:19.468 --> 17:24.317
Are your people, I mean, you've used the phrase, are your people ordinary people, though?

17:25.639 --> 17:26.521
Oh, I think so.

17:27.482 --> 17:33.853
I think of it in terms of, yeah, well, I think we all are.

17:33.873 --> 17:35.937
And it's

17:36.355 --> 17:44.926
I think it's... But are they going through extraordinary experiences or are these experiences endemic to all of us, would you say?

17:46.348 --> 18:00.565
Yeah, I think that's the biggest lesson, life lesson that people have to learn is that there's a lot of there's a lot of grief and trauma and difficulty in everyone's life.

18:00.585 --> 18:03.409
And it's

18:03.811 --> 18:06.395
It's not really so much what happens to you.

18:08.017 --> 18:10.260
It's how you figure out how to deal with it.

18:10.280 --> 18:14.786
Well, did you see grief here as really kind of a sub... Yeah, I did.

18:15.247 --> 18:16.429
Yeah.

18:17.510 --> 18:26.182
They were... Somebody asked me the other day about... It seems like the subject of Ordinary People and the subject of this book is basically the same.

18:26.202 --> 18:27.644
Did you see it as the same?

18:27.664 --> 18:29.487
And I said, no, I didn't see it the same at all.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.451
I think what I was trying to do in Ordinary People was...

18:32.920 --> 18:54.709
explore the anatomy of depression and figure out and so i had to have an incident that was really what would cause somebody to be that depressed it would have to be something huge that happens to them like a death which actually i got a lot of mail from um from readers saying you know you don't have to have

18:54.858 --> 18:59.223
somebody die in order for you to experience that kind of depression.

18:59.283 --> 19:01.025
And I thought, well, of course you don't.

19:01.125 --> 19:01.686
That's true.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.748
But you're a novelist after all.

19:04.389 --> 19:05.370
I felt like I did.

19:05.730 --> 19:09.394
And so that story was really a made-up story.

19:09.815 --> 19:19.245
But this, my goal in this was to understand, try to learn something more for myself about grief.

19:19.748 --> 19:22.050
and what grief does to a family.

19:22.330 --> 19:24.693
And it really doesn't always pull them together, does it?

19:24.913 --> 19:25.754
No, it doesn't.

19:25.774 --> 19:28.116
In fact, I think most of the time it doesn't.

19:28.136 --> 19:28.736
It does not?

19:28.956 --> 19:29.217
No.

19:30.098 --> 19:35.523
Well, I remember a good friend of mine lost a daughter in her freshman year of college.

19:35.563 --> 19:37.865
She was in an automobile accident.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.167
And I read the statistics afterwards.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.769
And the statistics, you can hardly believe them.

19:42.789 --> 19:43.770
They're so high.

19:44.171 --> 19:46.853
But the statistics are that 90% of people

19:47.542 --> 19:50.226
of couples divorce after the death of a child.

19:50.246 --> 19:51.067
I can believe that.

19:51.507 --> 19:54.071
Jesus, that just seems so incredible.

19:54.612 --> 19:57.676
You know, I mean, I've got two young, two teenage daughters.

19:57.716 --> 20:01.962
I mean, and when you were writing about the dread factor, I mean, a day doesn't go by.

20:02.042 --> 20:12.216
I say, you know, take care of these kids, you know, and you just worry about it every day in the worst case scenarios, you know, and, uh,

20:13.057 --> 20:16.881
And I've never actually seen it phrased quite like that, the dread factor, you know.

20:16.901 --> 20:19.104
But that's what it is.

20:19.144 --> 20:21.847
Yeah, that's what it is.

20:21.867 --> 20:27.053
Yeah, and it's funny because now, of course, all my kids are grown and married and have kids of their own.

20:27.894 --> 20:32.639
And the dread factor can also... Goes to the next generation, doesn't it?

20:32.659 --> 20:32.919
Sure.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.621
But it's different.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.564
I mean, it's not a day-to-day thing.

20:36.984 --> 20:39.587
But I'm nervous when they do stuff...

20:39.787 --> 20:41.109
That makes me nervous.

20:41.129 --> 20:41.509
Oh, yeah.

20:41.569 --> 20:44.172
I think, oh, God, I hope nothing happens while they're gone.

20:44.272 --> 20:46.535
Well, my 15-year-old went out New Year's Eve.

20:47.116 --> 20:49.539
I mean, and it was chaperoned and all this.

20:49.819 --> 20:51.982
But, man, I wasn't happy about that at all.

20:52.002 --> 20:55.205
I wanted to go with them.

20:55.225 --> 20:55.746
I know.

20:55.766 --> 20:56.307
I know.

20:56.327 --> 20:58.469
It's such a weaning process, isn't it?

20:58.489 --> 21:03.235
You always think you're weaning your kids to stand on your own, but you're really weaning yourself.

21:03.255 --> 21:03.956
I said, I'll come.

21:04.036 --> 21:04.477
I'll come.

21:04.877 --> 21:05.438
I'll drive.

21:05.518 --> 21:06.279
I'll be the driver.

21:07.280 --> 21:07.380
Yeah.

21:07.681 --> 21:10.765
Thanks, Dad, but no kidding.

21:10.785 --> 21:12.207
No, everything was fine.

21:13.749 --> 21:18.576
Anyway, you've done a lot of interviews, so I've got a lot of quotes to pull from here.

21:19.036 --> 21:20.739
Let me see.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.485
Do you agree that these are dysfunctional families that you write about?

21:25.525 --> 21:26.927
I don't necessarily think so.

21:27.107 --> 21:27.448
Or do you?

21:27.608 --> 21:28.149
Oh, yeah.

21:28.169 --> 21:30.912
I think all families are dysfunctional to a certain degree.

21:31.753 --> 21:32.795
Yeah.

21:32.815 --> 21:33.736
What is dysfunction?

21:33.756 --> 21:35.018
I don't see it as such a pejorative.

21:35.418 --> 21:35.899
I think...

21:36.183 --> 21:43.552
I think what I battle against a lot of times is that level of denial that people have, that everything's perfect, everything's right.

21:43.572 --> 21:55.246
Because I think when you're going around thinking everything's perfect, you're not really looking at what's going on in your family, and there's a much bigger chance that you're going to make a fatal mistake.

21:56.387 --> 22:04.317
I think if you're more willing to see that, you know, they're made up of people, and people have their flaws and their faults and their...

22:05.140 --> 22:06.722
Yeah, no, I do.

22:06.922 --> 22:08.945
Is there an uplifting element here for you?

22:10.968 --> 22:11.789
Well, yeah.

22:11.969 --> 22:12.870
For me, there is.

22:12.890 --> 22:26.068
I mean, I think... I think if you're willing to look at things the way they are, as much as you can, you're less apt to make bad mistakes.

22:27.169 --> 22:34.759
And then... And you're less apt to see these things, to keep them secret, and to think...

22:35.971 --> 22:39.737
You know, our family is the only family that this awful stuff goes on in.

22:39.757 --> 22:42.561
Everyone else is out there, you know, having a great time.

22:43.382 --> 22:46.146
And, I mean, we're all in this boat together.

22:46.266 --> 22:50.673
We all are doing essentially the same kinds of things.

22:51.594 --> 22:56.361
And I just think it's more helpful to admit that than it is to deny it.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.025
So you don't see this book as a downer?

23:00.087 --> 23:01.028
I don't, no.

23:01.048 --> 23:04.273
I don't even see it as... It's funny, though.

23:04.625 --> 23:11.373
Because several bookstore owners that I've met have said, well, I like this book a lot, but boy, it's really sad.

23:12.334 --> 23:13.375
And I said, it is?

23:13.635 --> 23:15.357
And they went, well, yes, it's sad.

23:15.377 --> 23:18.721
The father dies and the woman has to go on without him.

23:18.801 --> 23:22.465
And I think, uh-oh, well, I better be careful about it.

23:22.986 --> 23:23.847
It's not sad.

23:24.427 --> 23:28.692
But, you know, it is, in that sense, it is my grandparent's story.

23:28.891 --> 23:30.373
I grew up with that story.

23:30.674 --> 23:39.947
I grew up with a very strong grandmother and her sister, my great aunt, who lived with her and raised those kids for 40 years.

23:40.728 --> 23:50.161
And when I read on the book jacket that this was a tragedy, the word just jumped out at me.

23:51.123 --> 23:53.666
Well, that's people who don't understand the word tragedy either.

23:53.726 --> 23:58.493
People who use the word tragedy don't understand what it means, I think.

23:59.131 --> 24:00.853
you know, but that's a whole other story.

24:00.953 --> 24:01.193
Right.

24:01.554 --> 24:01.814
Yeah.

24:02.075 --> 24:04.117
But I, I never thought of that.

24:04.998 --> 24:13.869
I, I mean, you know, there are, there are incidents that happen in people's lives that are sad, but I don't think that makes your life sad.

24:14.650 --> 24:19.556
I think whether your life is sad or happy is again, more of an internal thing.

24:20.136 --> 24:22.980
It's your decision about how you're going to view this stuff.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.404
Well, I did an interview with Harold Bloom a couple of months ago, uh,

24:26.924 --> 24:28.447
And he said, well, he wrote this book.

24:28.507 --> 24:33.177
One of the things that was driving him nuts was this new fascination for the so-called near-death experience.

24:33.598 --> 24:37.706
He said, for God's sakes, all of life is a near-death experience.

24:39.550 --> 24:39.790
It is.

24:39.991 --> 24:42.416
Driving on the highway.

24:42.536 --> 24:44.961
And the thing is, it can change in two minutes, can't it?

24:45.162 --> 24:45.422
Yeah.

24:46.246 --> 24:52.694
And I found through life that the biggest things do happen so totally unexpectedly, too, don't they?

24:52.714 --> 24:56.839
Well, that just triggers one of my most favorite quotes by Iris Murdoch.

24:56.879 --> 24:59.122
There is no order in the world.

24:59.883 --> 25:03.407
There is only chance and the terror of chance.

25:03.427 --> 25:15.122
John Chancellor, the late John Chancellor, it was a wonderful obituary of him in the New York Times, and then he said his favorite quote was when he learned he had cancer, he says, if you really want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

25:17.448 --> 25:21.163
Is that a good one?

25:21.515 --> 25:28.281
Yeah, I mean, tell them what your 20-year plan is, in other words, what you expect to be doing 20 years from now or even 10 years from now.

25:28.301 --> 25:29.262
Ooh, that's scary.

25:29.282 --> 25:34.947
You know, if you want to make God laugh, right, which is, I love that quote.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.769
Well, listen, I think I've got plenty of stuff here.

25:37.429 --> 25:37.529
Good.

25:37.549 --> 25:41.693
And I think maybe, do you foresee a sequel coming out of this?

25:41.793 --> 25:42.274
Yeah, I do.

25:42.694 --> 25:44.596
I actually, I've actually already started.

25:44.616 --> 25:45.096
Oh, really?

25:45.136 --> 25:47.338
I mean, it seems like it's natural for a sequel.

25:47.558 --> 25:50.701
I mean, there is a lot of unfinished business here, shall we say.

25:50.781 --> 25:51.522
Yeah, there is.

25:51.502 --> 25:52.504
There is.

25:53.405 --> 25:54.146
Are you working on it?

25:54.767 --> 25:55.528
Yeah, I am.

25:55.589 --> 26:04.142
I'm going to be working on it for the next couple weeks because I have to go on tour and touring is so arduous.

26:04.303 --> 26:07.047
So who's going to be the center?

26:07.067 --> 26:07.768
Give me an idea.

26:08.429 --> 26:09.110
Who do you think?

26:09.671 --> 26:12.075
It's got to be Julie, I think, of course.

26:14.958 --> 26:18.962
Yeah, well, I've been reading books for a long time.

26:18.982 --> 26:21.725
I think that's funny, though, because people seem to always guess her.

26:22.426 --> 26:25.549
And I would think, well, why not Harry or why not Annie?

26:26.170 --> 26:27.110
What's going to happen to her?

26:27.631 --> 26:28.752
She has more possibilities.

26:29.113 --> 26:30.194
Yeah, Julie.

26:30.234 --> 26:32.856
Because really, I can't predict what you'll do with her.

26:33.457 --> 26:34.118
And that's good.

26:34.738 --> 26:35.519
Good.

26:35.539 --> 26:37.461
I mean, maybe I could, but I'd be wrong, you know.

26:37.962 --> 26:39.783
So I think I'll just wait and read what you do.

26:41.565 --> 26:43.227
But you're not going to take 10 years, are you?

26:43.460 --> 26:44.382
God, I hope not.

26:45.443 --> 26:46.064
When do you think?

26:46.545 --> 26:50.552
My agent says, hey, I ain't getting any younger.

26:50.572 --> 26:50.832
Come on.

26:50.852 --> 26:53.156
Beat it up, girl.

26:53.557 --> 26:53.958
That's great.

26:53.978 --> 26:54.639
Do you have a title?

26:55.761 --> 26:56.522
No, I don't.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.245
I don't have a title.

26:59.787 --> 27:01.350
You're going to keep her out where she is?

27:02.360 --> 27:03.322
Keep her where she is?

27:03.342 --> 27:03.822
What do you mean?

27:03.842 --> 27:06.286
Well, I mean in terms of place and stuff, do you see?

27:06.326 --> 27:09.010
Keep her where she is, yeah, but not the age she is.

27:09.030 --> 27:09.351
Okay.

27:09.451 --> 27:11.955
She's going to be, it jumps forward about 10 years.

27:12.095 --> 27:13.057
Okay, well, it'll be fun.

27:13.317 --> 27:14.299
Yeah, it will be fun.

27:14.499 --> 27:15.400
Look forward to it.

27:15.541 --> 27:16.041
Well, thanks.

27:16.242 --> 27:17.564
And I enjoyed our conversation.

27:17.764 --> 27:18.786
You too, thanks for calling.

27:18.806 --> 27:24.955
Okay, one other question if you don't mind, because if you don't want to tell me, that's okay, but do you mind telling me your age?

27:25.436 --> 27:26.418
Oh, no, I'm 60.

27:26.478 --> 27:26.578
Okay.

27:26.558 --> 27:27.201
60.

27:27.644 --> 27:28.026
Great.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.513
You don't mind my using that in the story?

27:29.534 --> 27:30.096
I don't mind.

27:30.117 --> 27:30.579
Terrific.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.182
Okay.

27:31.202 --> 27:31.886
Thanks a lot.

27:31.906 --> 27:32.107
Okay.

27:32.328 --> 27:32.871
Bye-bye.

27:32.931 --> 27:33.092
Bye-bye.
