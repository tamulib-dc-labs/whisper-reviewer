WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:10.848
I don't think the tape is cute.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.976
I'm sorry.

00:15.997 --> 00:18.841
No, it's a good line.

00:18.941 --> 00:20.103
I was going into L.A.

00:20.123 --> 00:21.746
just on a vacation.

00:21.986 --> 00:24.891
See, actually, we see Dan as a woman who's living with us.

00:25.597 --> 00:32.304
And on Wednesday, and he was in a screening role with David Sontag, who was the head of Fox TV at the time.

00:32.324 --> 00:36.668
And David said to him, I just saw the pilot at NBC, you know, a writer who could write it.

00:37.049 --> 00:40.452
He said, it's about a boy who sails around the world in a sailboat.

00:40.472 --> 00:41.574
Remember that old movie, Dove?

00:43.195 --> 00:46.839
And Dan said, oh yeah, there's a writer arriving in 15 minutes at LAF.

00:47.740 --> 00:53.646
But the reason was I published my first short story out of graduate school in the Atlantic Monthly.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.608
And it was about a family and a sailboat.

00:56.409 --> 01:00.817
So in Hollywood, he was thinking, vote equals vote.

01:01.298 --> 01:03.902
So that was on a Wednesday.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.386
No, let's keep it simple.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.313
So on Friday, Dan took me over to Fox and I met David.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.837
And David said to me, have you ever written a screenplay before?

01:12.917 --> 01:13.478
I said, no.

01:13.799 --> 01:14.800
He said, do you think you can?

01:14.860 --> 01:15.582
I said, yes.

01:15.602 --> 01:17.625
And Dan said, let's go.

01:17.858 --> 01:19.523
And we made a deal.

01:19.543 --> 01:22.691
What did you think you could write a theme?

01:22.751 --> 01:24.336
I mean, it is perfect.

01:25.479 --> 01:28.206
Writing short stories and screen plays.

01:28.996 --> 01:31.839
I'd like some protein.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.362
You know what I love is a blueberry muffin.

01:35.382 --> 01:42.550
They make wonderful blueberry muffins.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.190
Oh, do they?

01:43.991 --> 01:44.091
Sure.

01:44.111 --> 01:44.832
Can they get two?

01:45.492 --> 01:46.113
Sure.

01:46.233 --> 01:50.277
I mean, they trust me on this.

01:50.297 --> 01:51.799
I trust you.

01:51.899 --> 01:58.125
Muffins and clam chowder, right?

01:58.240 --> 01:59.823
Yeah, I guess.

01:59.843 --> 02:06.693
Why were you so certain that you could write a screenplay?

02:06.713 --> 02:07.575
Because I've gotten through movies so much.

02:07.595 --> 02:15.287
You know, in college I loved Fellini and Truffaut and I thought that making movies was

02:15.689 --> 02:17.411
equivalent to writing a novel.

02:17.731 --> 02:27.181
Because the tape is on, why don't you just go through college, don't even think about it, but why don't you just recycle the college experience?

02:27.201 --> 02:37.371
I went to college at BU, majored in English, then I graduated in 1971, then I went to Stanford Graduate School of Creative Writing.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.333
I was a master's professor.

02:39.353 --> 02:43.958
It is, you don't mind if I jump around.

02:44.461 --> 02:52.816
I find it very interesting and very good to me that you have these wonderful blurbs by three males.

02:53.056 --> 03:08.443
I think I've heard you read every one of them a number of times, but I admire their work, and I don't think that they would give blurbs gratuitously.

03:08.845 --> 03:23.566
Is it helpful for you to get this kind of recognition from the male counterparts in the series, the fact that your publisher is certainly making a big wave up with a woman?

03:23.687 --> 03:29.094
I don't really know how that happens, why the blurbs are for male writers.

03:29.675 --> 03:33.621
They do dominate the field, I guess.

03:34.613 --> 03:36.937
Deeply grateful to have them.

03:36.957 --> 03:40.282
They're completely untouched by me.

03:41.324 --> 03:43.968
They're genuine and very touching.

03:44.328 --> 03:47.113
One writer can extend that to another.

03:47.133 --> 03:51.340
It's very touching.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.969
I know your history and film quality.

03:57.730 --> 04:00.975
Was there disaffection on your part which led to the

04:01.259 --> 04:05.806
It was a combination of factors.

04:06.627 --> 04:14.599
I had been in business with my husband as a lyricist, but we were previous for a while working for Republic Pictures, doing television development.

04:14.719 --> 04:18.584
And everything was going along fine until the writer's strike.

04:18.765 --> 04:22.030
And the writer's strike basically wiped us out.

04:22.190 --> 04:22.971
You know what?

04:23.071 --> 04:26.636
I think it was 88, but don't quote me on that.

04:26.656 --> 04:29.140
I mean, I can tell you if you don't quote me on that.

04:30.183 --> 04:31.986
Yeah, it must have been around 88.

04:32.607 --> 04:46.028
And we had projects in development, and everything was groovy, and then all of a sudden, you're out of work for six months, and your contract was extended for another six months.

04:46.048 --> 04:48.712
The lady would like to try to make her blueberry muffins as well.

04:50.915 --> 04:51.596
Thank you.

04:53.339 --> 04:58.587
So basically, it was a very moralizing experience.

04:59.123 --> 05:11.357
At that point, and the system of trying to sell to television networks was also becoming very wary and very discouraging, even though we were in development and functioning.

05:11.377 --> 05:18.906
And we both made a decision to go back to our creative version, Douglas, his name is Douglas Grayfield, by the way.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.189
B-R-A-Y-F-I-E-L-D.

05:21.670 --> 05:28.017
Douglas went back to poetry and went for his master's degree

05:28.942 --> 05:37.951
So he decided to go for his Master's in Poetry.

05:38.371 --> 05:52.385
It was a non-residency program at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina, and it meant that each of us people wait for two weeks.

05:52.405 --> 05:54.467
It's a wonderful program, by the way.

05:54.487 --> 05:55.928
You work with one poet.

05:56.262 --> 06:02.188
Even at a time as a mentor, it worked on a pretty tight timeline.

06:02.549 --> 06:18.265
Meanwhile, I decided I would write this novel, and we made a lifestyle decision to do it, which meant that we went into our savings over the course of three and a half years, which took me to write a manuscript that I could show to somebody.

06:18.325 --> 06:19.646
I didn't show it to anybody.

06:19.666 --> 06:23.350
I didn't tell anybody what I was doing.

06:24.157 --> 06:26.020
We depleted half of our savings.

06:26.701 --> 06:32.809
And I did it by taking a gig in television for six months, writing a book for six months.

06:32.829 --> 06:35.753
I mean, it was an enormously stressful time.

06:35.773 --> 06:38.177
Fortunately, you had those options open to you.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.198
Yeah, yeah.

06:39.218 --> 06:39.759
Which is good.

06:39.779 --> 06:40.039
Right.

06:41.161 --> 06:41.702
That'll go up.

06:43.404 --> 06:47.730
Do you feel that you're writing, again, your first novel within a different genre?

06:49.052 --> 06:50.414
No, I don't think it's a genre.

06:50.914 --> 06:52.797
In fact, my agent, Molly Friedrich, said,

06:53.114 --> 06:54.836
We have to invent a genre for you.

06:56.178 --> 06:56.638
It's a great book.

06:56.658 --> 06:57.039
It's great.

06:57.079 --> 06:58.240
And she and her, yes.

06:59.301 --> 07:04.708
And she came up with the phrase, literary suspense, which I love.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.409
Tell me what that is.

07:06.049 --> 07:22.429
Well, that's a book that moves forward in a suspenseful way, that keeps the reader hooked, that depends on story, but also is concerned with revelation and insight.

07:25.497 --> 07:28.721
Probably more concerned with revelation and insight than plot.

07:29.962 --> 07:32.085
And yet it wants to be entertaining.

07:34.187 --> 07:39.674
Probably the first thing it wants to be is entertaining for the reader and fun and a good read.

07:39.694 --> 07:41.756
But it has a real heart and soul.

07:42.096 --> 07:48.704
And it has, you know, what we think of as, quote, literary goals, which is to illuminate.

07:49.806 --> 07:51.067
So it tries to do all of that.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.352
Well, and as far as the character, how do you expect to bring the character back?

07:55.737 --> 07:57.639
I think I will, but not in the next book.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.822
Maybe the following book.

07:59.842 --> 08:02.265
And you have created a... I know.

08:02.285 --> 08:07.411
...that happens typically in the business.

08:07.431 --> 08:16.402
I mean, the first one establishes you, and if it takes up, you know, around the fifth or the sixth book, you're an enterprise.

08:16.842 --> 08:17.904
I know, I know.

08:17.944 --> 08:18.965
And maybe you don't want that.

08:19.005 --> 08:24.351
Maybe that goes back to the literary, what was the category again?

08:24.652 --> 08:25.693
Literary suspense.

08:26.804 --> 08:30.309
So maybe you have to continually come up with your characters.

08:30.329 --> 08:34.053
Now, will the next book be of a literary suspense nature?

08:34.073 --> 08:34.774
Yeah, it will.

08:34.894 --> 08:35.856
I can't talk about it.

08:36.016 --> 08:36.857
That's fine.

08:36.957 --> 08:40.261
I know I'm just inventing that, yeah.

08:40.762 --> 08:44.807
No, it will have the same... Do you not have to get the usual standards?

08:44.827 --> 08:45.188
Do you not?

08:45.208 --> 08:45.768
I'm pretty good.

08:45.788 --> 08:47.090
Are they okay?

08:47.110 --> 08:47.290
Uh-huh.

08:47.310 --> 08:47.431
Okay.

08:47.451 --> 08:47.591
Uh-huh.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.733
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

08:49.754 --> 08:49.954
No.

08:51.376 --> 08:52.557
It will move in the same way.

08:52.577 --> 08:54.820
It will have suspense and tension and drama

08:55.238 --> 09:02.526
It'll be a different world and different characters.

09:02.546 --> 09:03.788
So you decided to do the novel.

09:03.908 --> 09:04.769
There was a writer's strike.

09:06.410 --> 09:09.574
And I've read someplace you hold yourself up in an office.

09:09.594 --> 09:11.196
You chose not to work at home.

09:12.417 --> 09:12.938
Good idea.

09:15.400 --> 09:15.521
Yeah.

09:16.261 --> 09:16.702
And then what?

09:17.523 --> 09:20.406
You sit down and you look at the word processor or the typewriter.

09:22.048 --> 09:22.969
Did you have a character?

09:22.989 --> 09:24.891
Was she fully formed?

09:25.411 --> 09:26.793
You know, from the mind of Zeus.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.397
Yeah, well, that would have been good.

09:30.639 --> 09:33.644
No, I started with a story.

09:33.684 --> 09:34.946
I didn't start with a character.

09:35.948 --> 09:37.991
I knew I wanted to tell a story of betrayal.

09:39.213 --> 09:41.777
And in this book, there are many stories of betrayal.

09:42.619 --> 09:46.846
Seeing this is used in a lot of different ways.

09:47.266 --> 09:48.548
And I'm attracted to the story.

09:48.628 --> 09:49.690
That's what turns me on.

09:50.391 --> 09:52.735
That's what I couldn't let go of for three and a half years.

09:53.305 --> 09:57.249
But actually, the main character in the book was not Anna Gray when it started out.

09:57.429 --> 10:12.903
The main character was Clare, and in the late 80s, I wanted to write a story about greed and acquisition in Santa Monica, and about a woman who goes too far.

10:13.543 --> 10:14.764
That was originally what it was.

10:15.585 --> 10:19.228
But Anna Gray took over.

10:19.248 --> 10:20.950
Anna Gray's voice, yeah.

10:21.149 --> 10:34.867
I knew there would be a story about a white woman, upper-class, quote, housewife, and the relationship between her and Hispanic housekeeper.

10:35.107 --> 10:38.031
And in that relationship, I could see conflict and betrayal.

10:38.271 --> 10:49.806
And then I also knew there would be another character who would be the moralizing force, who came in from the outside and, like the detective or like the hero,

10:50.056 --> 11:00.709
creates order out of chaos, you know, and I knew that character would be related to the housekeeper somehow, and thus Anna Graham was born, and I wanted her to be in law enforcement.

11:01.590 --> 11:05.695
And so it was sort of a groping process.

11:05.715 --> 11:15.086
But once I got the outlines for her, once I got her voice, because I knew also, you know, there was another sort of cognitive leap where I realized that that character would tell the story.

11:15.126 --> 11:17.889
I was going to say, you knew that it was going to be narrated, I guess.

11:17.909 --> 11:20.012
Yeah, well, that was another step in the

11:20.600 --> 11:24.144
that that character would be the narrator.

11:24.164 --> 11:29.711
Now that she's the narrator, all of a sudden, now you're on the road to becoming her story more and more and more.

11:29.731 --> 11:37.381
And I did many, many rewrites of the book, turning it and turning it and turning it more and more to Anna's part of me.

11:37.401 --> 11:40.244
Well, it really did go through a number of lives.

11:41.385 --> 11:50.016
And that is a departure from what you've been doing over the last 15 or so years, I mean, to really write with the first person narrating.

11:50.097 --> 11:54.101
The way you write is a screenplay, is it?

11:54.121 --> 11:54.382
No.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.724
A television script.

11:56.744 --> 11:58.907
I gather, I've never written one like that.

11:59.808 --> 12:05.033
So this really was a challenge.

12:05.053 --> 12:10.639
The challenge was to keep it in that point of view and to tell stories.

12:10.960 --> 12:16.746
I mean, if you analyze this book, you can't imagine the number of outlines.

12:17.114 --> 12:32.676
stages and index cards and diagrams, you know, that I went through, to be able to tell the story of these... There were four really main characters, four women characters, to tell all those stories from one person's point of view.

12:32.696 --> 12:37.242
Well, that's... That's just impossible, really.

12:37.262 --> 12:38.724
Yeah, yeah.

12:38.944 --> 12:43.230
I mean, there are things that you give up when you choose to marry the novel.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.113
I mean, you can't have a relation...

12:48.282 --> 12:51.487
viewpoint to viewpoint to get into the head.

12:52.389 --> 12:55.914
Did you decide on this present tense kind of structure from the beginning?

12:56.155 --> 13:01.544
You do have verbs in present tense as you were getting off the elevators.

13:02.305 --> 13:03.807
I wasn't really aware of it in the beginning.

13:03.968 --> 13:08.074
You know, I said, well, maybe she's alternating, you know.

13:08.094 --> 13:10.999
But tell me about, you know, the decision.

13:11.019 --> 13:12.962
Yeah, no, I love it.

13:12.982 --> 13:13.463
Yeah, no.

13:13.983 --> 13:19.271
I think it was because I feel first person present tense has a lot of force and immediacy.

13:19.291 --> 13:24.458
Actually, it's similar to movies, in the sense that you're in real time.

13:25.700 --> 13:30.086
The story goes forward in real time, and you're in the present tense.

13:30.106 --> 13:32.109
And I wanted drive.

13:32.971 --> 13:36.636
I felt that would give a drive.

13:36.816 --> 13:42.825
You know, I was again looking at the, going back to the opening chapter.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.673
I said, I'll be damned.

13:44.993 --> 13:48.901
It was done very well because I wasn't aware of it.

13:48.921 --> 13:57.257
Instead of, it started with, you know, it starts with a bank robbery.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.920
It was pure sex.

13:58.940 --> 14:02.647
I said, well, what are we getting into?

14:02.687 --> 14:03.328
Kind of a...

14:03.578 --> 14:13.532
I read the whole first chapter, and I said, well, keep reading.

14:20.501 --> 14:27.731
You knew that this would feature women as a protagonist.

14:27.751 --> 14:32.337
Can you tell me a little bit about female women?

14:33.042 --> 14:41.293
heroes and especially crime detection and prevention.

14:41.393 --> 14:44.437
Of course, you've had experience doing this on television as well.

14:45.178 --> 14:50.184
So I guess you did want to borrow from that experience in the novel.

14:50.265 --> 14:56.873
Or does this reflect a philosophical intention in your character?

14:56.893 --> 14:59.477
That's a soft line.

14:59.497 --> 15:00.358
You can go anywhere you want.

15:00.378 --> 15:01.640
Go anywhere you want.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.020
Okay.

15:02.742 --> 15:09.511
It's challenging for a woman to be in law enforcement.

15:09.531 --> 15:11.034
It still is.

15:11.054 --> 15:19.005
And I did research for Cagney and Lacey by hanging out with New York City cops and talking to female detectives.

15:19.525 --> 15:26.135
And I did research for this book by hanging out to some degree with the FBI, talking to female FBI agents.

15:27.116 --> 15:30.741
I think since I did Cagney and Lacey, which was over ten years ago,

15:31.345 --> 15:46.788
Women have learned how to adapt to the situation in the workplace, both the personal interactions with mainly men, and then the physical challenges of the job and the emotional challenges of the job.

15:47.309 --> 15:48.831
And they walk a very fine line.

15:49.792 --> 15:53.758
It's that, you know, ineffable question of femininity.

15:54.159 --> 15:56.863
How much femininity can you retain?

15:57.805 --> 16:02.630
What's the line between femininity and aggression?

16:02.650 --> 16:17.767
And some of the women in the FBI that I met, I really, really admired because they were very bright and had a sense of humor about themselves and yet had an easy way with the men and didn't make issues out of things that weren't issues.

16:18.168 --> 16:19.970
And it takes the maturity to do that.

16:19.990 --> 16:21.652
There's no whining.

16:21.672 --> 16:23.153
You have to know when to let things slide.

16:23.173 --> 16:23.734
You do.

16:23.754 --> 16:24.274
You do.

16:25.596 --> 16:27.458
And I'd say no whining.

16:27.826 --> 16:31.010
It's kind of the credo.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.292
And I admire that.

16:32.472 --> 16:34.655
And it's a challenge for every working woman.

16:35.837 --> 16:37.339
So I think people can identify with it.

16:37.359 --> 16:41.264
Especially in that particular business, which is so historically male.

16:41.304 --> 16:41.444
Yeah.

16:41.464 --> 16:43.707
And in my job, even more than male.

16:44.108 --> 16:44.248
Right.

16:44.268 --> 16:47.853
Persona would be a type of crowd, I guess.

16:47.873 --> 16:48.113
Right.

16:48.835 --> 17:02.988
It's a little different in the FBI, which is probably why I felt more comfortable with it, because even though they carry guns and they have to pass physical exams every few months, it's not like being a street cop where you're confronted with physical danger.

17:04.149 --> 17:13.557
So I think the women there might be a little more adaptive to it, not quite as physically challenged, which is the subject of the opening of this book.

17:13.577 --> 17:18.842
You know, Anna confronts physical, what's potentially physical dangerous.

17:19.514 --> 17:23.319
And I take you through it in her mind, how she processes it.

17:24.381 --> 17:25.742
I found it interesting, anyway.

17:26.664 --> 17:29.988
This is coincidental this morning.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.712
I might call them curious in Worcester on a Wednesday.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.094
Everybody else takes them on a weekend.

17:35.536 --> 17:40.823
This is great, because I get a chance to look at it.

17:40.843 --> 17:41.183
There it is.

17:41.323 --> 17:43.526
Great editor over there.

17:43.666 --> 17:47.632
She'll call me with a thing, knowing that, you know, I'm sending it along.

17:47.872 --> 17:48.313
That's good.

17:48.333 --> 17:48.593
Anyway.

17:48.877 --> 18:00.497
Anyway, there's a story on the front page of this female cop from one of the towns who was helping a woman fill out a form to put a restraining order on her husband.

18:00.878 --> 18:03.843
The husband shows up while they're doing this and tax her.

18:03.863 --> 18:04.023
Wow.

18:04.143 --> 18:07.750
And she's going through it and she manages to call in for help.

18:08.130 --> 18:08.371
Wow.

18:08.691 --> 18:10.254
And another cop comes by.

18:10.274 --> 18:11.937
I mean, it was one of these towns.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.059
It's a page one story.

18:13.900 --> 18:14.361
I don't know.

18:14.847 --> 18:16.529
But she needed the help.

18:16.549 --> 18:18.732
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:18.752 --> 18:19.072
Right.

18:19.092 --> 18:20.254
And she was good.

18:21.495 --> 18:23.738
She was terrific.

18:23.838 --> 18:25.580
Another cop came in 15 o'clock.

18:25.681 --> 18:30.206
I mean, that was really, very scary in this day and age.

18:30.226 --> 18:32.429
You know, she was bitten by anybody.

18:32.449 --> 18:34.932
And there's her picture on the front page.

18:35.232 --> 18:38.396
And that is a decided situation.

18:38.757 --> 18:43.723
And your character faces it in a sequence, you know.

18:44.075 --> 18:53.353
If the person is big and tough and you don't have the courage to shoot him, you might be faking something that you can't handle.

18:53.453 --> 18:55.617
If you deal with that.

18:55.637 --> 18:55.917
Right.

18:56.018 --> 18:57.681
I try to deal with that.

18:58.563 --> 19:05.155
And I think women cuffs, we portray them as handling situations differently from others.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.726
That was something we were looking to portray.

19:07.766 --> 19:09.388
How would, what would the difference be?

19:09.408 --> 19:23.789
And one of them was, well, at least in Lacey's case, she had a big mouth, and she talked a lot, and she would talk her way out of, or talk to somebody, and try to connect with them, rather than just using force.

19:24.149 --> 19:34.264
I know this also, I feel that this is a very visual novel, and I'm sure that having worked in LA has helped you

19:34.497 --> 19:38.282
I just think that you very easily become a movie.

19:38.642 --> 19:42.687
Is that something that's being considered?

19:42.708 --> 19:43.168
Oh, yeah.

19:43.248 --> 19:49.076
Well, I wrote the book to write the book, and the book stands on its own, and I'm proud of it.

19:49.176 --> 19:52.660
And if it becomes a movie, that's fabulous.

19:52.680 --> 19:59.509
But if it becomes a movie, it'll be somebody else's vision, even if I write the screenplay.

19:59.843 --> 20:01.946
It'll be the director's vision.

20:01.966 --> 20:09.656
And so that will be a point which I'll have to cross, but there's a lot of interest in the moment.

20:10.217 --> 20:15.684
You might just talk about that, but I've had humorous writers discuss this in the past.

20:15.704 --> 20:23.855
I mean, the satisfaction of writing a book in a way, I guess, almost incognito.

20:24.155 --> 20:25.778
Nobody knew you were doing the thing, right?

20:25.798 --> 20:26.138
Yeah, right.

20:26.388 --> 20:33.982
And, I mean, when you're talking to a producer or a director, you're thinking that the talent is going to be amazing, but it was just your own little world with your creative.

20:34.002 --> 20:34.222
Right.

20:34.242 --> 20:40.133
And that really must be a pleasant departure for you from what you've been discussing.

20:40.153 --> 20:41.035
That's very true.

20:41.055 --> 20:50.151
It was a pleasure, but once I got over the fear and terror and I got into it, it was exhilarating to write, because you don't know where it's going to lead.

20:50.536 --> 20:56.425
And in screenwriting, you're very constricted, and everything proceeds according to time.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.510
You know, in a television movie, you have seven acts.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.773
Each act has to be a certain amount of minutes long.

21:02.154 --> 21:07.502
And you're building toward commercial breaks, which has nothing to do with the way a story would unfold.

21:08.363 --> 21:12.029
You weren't cognizant of these kinds of constrictions when you were writing?

21:12.389 --> 21:14.312
I mean, the breaks are perfect here.

21:14.392 --> 21:19.480
I don't suggest in any way that they, but I seem to think that you do have this built-in

21:20.557 --> 21:23.240
sense of where something should end.

21:23.801 --> 21:24.622
Yeah.

21:24.642 --> 21:25.183
No, I do.

21:25.203 --> 21:25.943
No, definitely.

21:25.983 --> 21:30.008
But at least I think the story can find its own way to do that.

21:30.148 --> 21:32.111
You're not doing it in terms of minutes and lines.

21:32.131 --> 21:32.371
Right.

21:33.092 --> 21:33.272
Right.

21:33.593 --> 21:37.017
And the network's expectation, you know, writing by committee.

21:37.758 --> 21:42.383
Is this a break for you from that professional life?

21:42.884 --> 21:47.149
I mean, it's certainly a departure, but is it a new life?

21:47.189 --> 21:49.011
Are you a novelist now?

21:49.447 --> 21:50.849
I feel like a novelist.

21:50.869 --> 21:51.470
Oh, you are an author.

21:51.490 --> 21:52.391
I feel like an author.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.875
I love that word, author.

21:54.895 --> 21:55.315
Isn't it nice?

21:55.616 --> 21:56.357
I love that word.

21:56.437 --> 21:58.039
I love it better than writer.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.822
I love the word author.

21:59.842 --> 22:00.603
But you have to learn it.

22:00.904 --> 22:01.524
Yes, you do.

22:02.185 --> 22:02.606
You do.

22:03.868 --> 22:04.609
Isn't that right?

22:04.629 --> 22:06.512
Yeah, it is.

22:06.532 --> 22:06.692
Yeah.

22:06.712 --> 22:07.273
It's nuts.

22:07.293 --> 22:14.042
There's a wonderful line in that movie, League of Their Own, and it's about baseball, but I apply it to writing.

22:14.062 --> 22:15.825
It's that for easy, everybody would be talking.

22:16.396 --> 22:17.738
It's not easy.

22:17.758 --> 22:18.058
It's over easy.

22:18.078 --> 22:18.439
It's over easy.

22:18.499 --> 22:20.942
Everybody would be doing it.

22:20.962 --> 22:23.466
And I think even more so in writing.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.970
It's not easy at all.

22:26.030 --> 22:26.711
It's impossible.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.815
And it's really impossible to start your first book.

22:29.855 --> 22:32.739
How people do it is beyond me.

22:33.260 --> 22:39.709
And after that, and especially if the book does well, then it's kind of a piece of cake, isn't it?

22:39.729 --> 22:39.989
Yeah.

22:40.010 --> 22:40.991
It is impossible.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.553
It's just impossible.

22:42.573 --> 22:44.836
Tell me a little bit about that, if you might.

22:44.937 --> 22:45.998
I mean, you wrote the book.

22:46.619 --> 22:48.402
Was there any expectations?

22:48.582 --> 22:49.944
I mean, there was hope, certainly.

22:49.964 --> 22:51.206
Yeah, but I really... No commitment, thank you.

22:51.226 --> 22:51.947
No, no.

22:52.768 --> 22:53.709
No agent, even.

22:53.729 --> 22:55.392
No agent.

22:58.316 --> 23:06.147
I felt I was putting everything I had into this book, everything I had, literally, and using all my craft.

23:06.227 --> 23:08.771
And by the way, it also needs to be done.

23:08.891 --> 23:15.360
I couldn't have done it without the total support of my husband, who believes in me and my talents, and also in the story.

23:15.965 --> 23:24.396
And he was my editor, I guess, because he was the only one who I talked to for that length of time.

23:24.416 --> 23:36.551
And then, later on, I did hire a freelance editor before the end, Sandy Gellis Paul, who, when I was ready to show it, she was the first person I showed it to for professional opinion.

23:36.571 --> 23:37.252
Where is she at?

23:37.272 --> 23:38.093
She's out of New York.

23:38.974 --> 23:43.980
She's an acquisitions editor for Doubleday for 15 years, and she was Daniel Steele's editor.

23:44.129 --> 23:49.656
So she's very smart and knows publishing and knows what, you know, what works.

23:50.838 --> 23:58.528
There comes a point where you must show it to people, and the more people you show it to, the better, even though it's scary and painful.

23:58.548 --> 24:02.013
So when I was at that point, I did, I showed it to her, I showed it to Dan.

24:02.714 --> 24:05.257
You know, I showed it to trusted people.

24:05.998 --> 24:07.680
And people with professional size.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.161
Yeah.

24:08.261 --> 24:09.643
Not people who are that bad.

24:09.663 --> 24:09.964
I love it.

24:10.404 --> 24:10.624
No.

24:10.644 --> 24:11.005
It's wonderful.

24:11.285 --> 24:11.506
No.

24:12.026 --> 24:12.567
That is it.

24:13.188 --> 24:18.353
reassuring, and that may be, or it's not a professional appeal.

24:18.373 --> 24:18.674
No.

24:19.415 --> 24:20.576
And you want to be in the book.

24:20.596 --> 24:21.717
Yeah.

24:21.737 --> 24:29.405
And so then you got an agent, and... Well, what happened was I showed it to my agents at CAA, because, you know, they represent me in television.

24:29.986 --> 24:30.927
Again, professional.

24:31.487 --> 24:34.891
And we made a list of New York agents that kept getting small.

24:34.911 --> 24:36.112
You know, we kept winning it down.

24:36.513 --> 24:37.774
And so basically we had two.

24:38.735 --> 24:40.697
They both wanted to represent the book.

24:41.842 --> 24:45.767
So I went to New York and interviewed with both of them.

24:46.208 --> 24:50.734
That was very scary for me, because I felt that was the moment of truth.

24:50.754 --> 24:54.519
They might say they liked the book, but what did that mean, you know?

24:54.559 --> 24:56.741
They agreed to take it, too.

24:56.761 --> 25:05.733
Agreed to take it, but, you know, I'm so accustomed to feedback, and would they take it, but would they want a big rewrite?

25:06.013 --> 25:10.279
You know, would they take it, but think maybe they'll sell it for some small amount of money or whatever?

25:10.411 --> 25:16.337
But I really consciously tried to not have expectations about the sale.

25:16.357 --> 25:20.542
Anyway, I chose Molly Friedrich because she's fabulous and incredibly enthusiastic.

25:20.582 --> 25:22.164
She loved this book.

25:22.184 --> 25:24.887
And I met with her on Thursday.

25:24.927 --> 25:26.749
Told her on Friday I'd go with her.

25:27.509 --> 25:30.192
Went back to L.A.

25:30.212 --> 25:30.913
Gets better.

25:32.495 --> 25:34.897
On Monday, she called me and said, I'm thrilled.

25:34.937 --> 25:35.658
We're going to do this.

25:35.818 --> 25:37.600
I'm sending it out to 15 publishers.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.341
Here's my letter.

25:38.361 --> 25:40.283
She wrote an incredible two-page letter.

25:40.803 --> 25:43.888
And she said, you'll hear in about two weeks.

25:43.908 --> 25:45.610
Tuesday morning, the next day.

25:46.271 --> 25:47.393
Two weeks is fast, too.

25:47.513 --> 25:47.954
Yeah.

25:48.395 --> 25:50.458
Well, the next day, which was Tuesday.

25:51.139 --> 25:53.583
She calls me at 8.30 in the morning, LA time.

25:54.164 --> 25:57.269
It was 11.30 in New York, right?

25:57.289 --> 25:58.050
8.30, 9.30, yeah.

25:58.070 --> 26:00.814
And she said, I have four offers.

26:00.834 --> 26:00.914
Wow.

26:01.776 --> 26:02.236
Overnight?

26:02.757 --> 26:03.218
Overnight.

26:03.318 --> 26:05.321
Literally in less than 24 hours.

26:05.341 --> 26:06.843
Did Sonny make the offer on this?

26:07.284 --> 26:09.207
Well, yeah, sort of.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.162
You're not going to get into technology?

26:12.203 --> 26:13.064
No, no, no.

26:13.664 --> 26:13.904
All right.

26:14.265 --> 26:19.231
What happened was she had given it to the publishers like at 1 o'clock.

26:19.251 --> 26:20.312
I just love this story.

26:20.392 --> 26:22.394
I know it's one of those hopeful things.

26:23.195 --> 26:38.873
She gave them, this book got out like 1 in the afternoon, and people started reading it, and they started to get excited, and they gave it to editors, and literally it's like, I mean, it sounds incredibly narcissistic, but it's true that half of New York publishing was up all night reading my book, including Sonny Mehta.

26:39.663 --> 26:42.968
Somebody got it to him, and he read it that night until 41.

26:44.450 --> 26:53.363
So the next day she had one offer from a publisher that was preemptive.

26:54.284 --> 26:58.550
And she said, this offer is only good for 45 minutes.

26:58.570 --> 27:01.354
You have to decide by 12.15 New York Times.

27:02.957 --> 27:06.081
So my husband was riding his bicycle in Venice.

27:06.101 --> 27:07.383
My kids were running around.

27:07.403 --> 27:08.725
I'm a three-year-old and a nine-year-old.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.996
You know, it's like 8.30 in the morning, and parakeets are flying all over the room.

27:13.056 --> 27:14.318
We've taken the parakeets out.

27:14.338 --> 27:16.841
And I said to Molly, I can't do this now.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.366
She said, you have to, or it's going to evaporate.

27:21.668 --> 27:26.394
So I talked to this one editor who was the head of the publishing house.

27:26.754 --> 27:28.276
Another publishing house or this publishing house?

27:28.296 --> 27:30.079
Yeah, no, another publishing house.

27:30.099 --> 27:31.661
And she was on the phone with another.

27:31.721 --> 27:32.802
And don't use this, okay?

27:32.822 --> 27:33.343
No.

27:33.363 --> 27:35.486
She was on the phone with another editor.

27:36.327 --> 27:37.108
Okay.

27:37.628 --> 27:40.233
So, actually, you turned down the office.

27:40.333 --> 27:43.158
I turned down the office.

27:43.378 --> 27:43.659
Right.

27:43.679 --> 27:45.181
And once I had passed on that.

27:46.083 --> 27:56.220
And one of the reasons, perhaps, was there were certain artistic requirements that were being imposed that you chose were perhaps a bit too restrictive.

27:56.741 --> 27:57.122
Right.

27:57.305 --> 28:04.091
and I thought it would be worth it to take less money in order to write the book that I had labored on for three and a half years.

28:04.251 --> 28:10.497
So, in fact, there was a lot more money being offered than you ultimately accepted from crop?

28:10.617 --> 28:12.178
Well... More money?

28:12.999 --> 28:15.962
Actually, yeah.

28:15.982 --> 28:17.763
It would have worked out to a lot more money.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.126
And is this a hard-soft deal or a hard case?

28:22.227 --> 28:23.108
It's great.

28:23.128 --> 28:25.350
So the paperback is still yours.

28:25.370 --> 28:25.590
Yeah.

28:25.975 --> 28:28.820
Right.

28:29.762 --> 28:38.097
But so when I had passed on the deal, then it was okay, because I wasn't going back and there wasn't any bargaining, you know, we weren't going to clean anybody off together.

28:38.137 --> 28:42.786
And then Molly said, okay, now I can tell you, you also have interest from starting that.

28:43.103 --> 28:48.773
My husband comes back from bicycling.

28:54.504 --> 28:57.309
He's all sweaty.

28:57.509 --> 28:58.631
I'm writing these numbers.

28:58.691 --> 29:00.775
I'm just going crazy.

29:00.855 --> 29:01.176
Crazy.

29:01.516 --> 29:05.263
It was the most exhilarating...

29:05.243 --> 29:06.385
I'm in my pajamas.

29:06.466 --> 29:08.069
I mean, it was me back.

29:08.370 --> 29:11.336
I'm talking to Sonny, and you know, haven't you spoken to Sonny?

29:11.416 --> 29:13.280
Oh, he's fabulous.

29:13.301 --> 29:23.202
But in five minutes, in five minutes, he spoke to the heart of the book, how to make the heart of the book

29:23.587 --> 29:26.311
more accessible and more realized.

29:26.631 --> 29:31.258
And I hung up with him, and I called Molly.

29:31.338 --> 29:36.245
And he is your editor on the book?

29:36.425 --> 29:37.046
I am.

29:37.086 --> 29:42.053
And she said, I'm getting the children of thinking about it.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.378
Well, I'm getting so.

29:45.598 --> 29:52.969
But it's certainly a validation, isn't it, that the time that you spent, it wasn't just filling.

29:53.422 --> 30:04.100
It was recognized by, you know, what many believe is particularly a publisher.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.223
I stick a line up here with .

30:06.363 --> 30:07.606
Oh, yeah.

30:07.746 --> 30:10.871
Well, that's when you talk about genre.

30:10.911 --> 30:13.355
Genre doesn't apply to something, I think.

30:13.375 --> 30:18.163
And that was so attractive to me that he's got my attention.

30:18.143 --> 30:21.468
Did he make that point, by the way?

30:21.488 --> 30:22.449
Yeah, yeah.

30:22.469 --> 30:26.655
Did you talk to him personally, or was it strictly between the agents?

30:26.675 --> 30:29.118
I mean, was there a point where you talked to him directly?

30:29.198 --> 30:30.580
I talked to him directly.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.764
Yeah, when he made the decision to go with him, I talked to him.

30:33.784 --> 30:34.886
Is that wonderful?

30:35.527 --> 30:39.853
And did he need to think that it would be a $200,000 fresh printing?

30:40.013 --> 30:42.396
No, no, not that bad.

30:42.528 --> 30:48.034
who I get on the strength I get of interest from bookstores.

30:48.054 --> 30:48.815
Yeah, that's right.

30:48.835 --> 30:50.837
That decision was not made into this year.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.640
I have no idea what my first plan is going to be.

30:53.700 --> 31:01.349
It's probably going to be small, but if there are people that are interested in it, then they adjust whatever that one is going to be, I guess.

31:01.369 --> 31:02.290
I guess that's how it works.

31:02.370 --> 31:03.551
Yeah.

31:03.571 --> 31:04.973
Are you working now on the next book?

31:05.233 --> 31:06.274
I'm thinking about it.

31:06.338 --> 31:06.878
I'm stuck.

31:07.259 --> 31:09.180
I had two TV scripts I had to finish.

31:10.662 --> 31:11.462
I don't know.

31:11.563 --> 31:15.486
Are they for an ongoing series or at least speculative films?

31:17.428 --> 31:19.930
No, they're movies of the week.

31:19.950 --> 31:22.712
And one of them's for NBC.

31:22.732 --> 31:24.274
They're both originally for NBC.

31:25.214 --> 31:26.936
But we'll be in there.

31:27.597 --> 31:30.039
Of course, television is changing, isn't it?

31:30.099 --> 31:31.140
With all these offers.

31:31.160 --> 31:35.063
Who's making these offers with the networks and the distribution stuff?

31:35.245 --> 31:36.607
But that's all changing.

31:37.067 --> 31:44.216
I've got some very interesting quotes from you about this fundamental change in the whole industry.

31:45.918 --> 31:46.399
You do.

31:46.419 --> 31:48.641
It is almost there.

31:49.262 --> 31:54.649
That's servitude, isn't it?

31:54.709 --> 32:01.377
How the letters are working now, and while there's a lot of money, there isn't really a lot of money for a lot of people.

32:01.497 --> 32:04.881
Development money was dried up.

32:05.047 --> 32:11.233
And if Disney does buy a network and then somebody else buys the other network, I mean, this is all going to be a closed shop, isn't it?

32:11.253 --> 32:11.574
That's right.

32:12.254 --> 32:12.875
It is.

32:12.935 --> 32:14.737
It would be really big weather.

32:16.238 --> 32:26.429
So the creative stuff, that just... So this was really... I mean, this wasn't just something to cast away the other flowers.

32:26.449 --> 32:26.609
No.

32:27.430 --> 32:32.775
No, this was written out of a certain kind of desperation and a certain...

32:33.262 --> 32:37.066
I don't know, defiance, certain anger.

32:39.428 --> 32:40.268
And why Santa Monica?

32:40.289 --> 32:48.957
You mentioned that you knew it would be before you had the character, before you really had to... You knew it was going to be Santa Monica.

32:48.997 --> 32:50.338
You said that earlier, I think.

32:50.418 --> 32:51.399
Why is that?

32:51.419 --> 32:52.460
Why Santa Monica?

32:52.520 --> 32:54.181
Well, I live in Santa Monica.

32:54.402 --> 32:55.062
Oh, I don't know.

32:55.122 --> 32:57.705
Just because I live there, and it was very thrilling.

32:57.725 --> 33:01.328
It was very emotional.

33:01.612 --> 33:02.774
But again, it took a while.

33:02.794 --> 33:05.298
But the North of Montana image is pretty nice.

33:05.378 --> 33:05.738
Yeah.

33:05.758 --> 33:08.502
It is resonant.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.345
It's resonant.

33:10.385 --> 33:11.908
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:12.989 --> 33:13.690
Yeah.

33:13.710 --> 33:14.972
There's a resonance to it.

33:15.032 --> 33:16.294
Yeah.

33:16.995 --> 33:23.205
And I have to say, you know, when it came in, as we knew, I never felt right about it.

33:24.026 --> 33:24.767
I know.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.030
But that's okay.

33:26.050 --> 33:27.552
That's a nice little adjustment.

33:27.772 --> 33:28.413
That's fine.

33:28.433 --> 33:29.694
It requires you to look at it.

33:29.994 --> 33:31.616
And it's a great cover.

33:31.656 --> 33:34.099
It really doesn't tell you much of anything, you know.

33:34.119 --> 33:35.660
It's just pretty.

33:36.001 --> 33:36.301
It's beautiful.

33:36.321 --> 33:36.461
Mm-hmm.

33:36.862 --> 33:38.904
Well, Chip Kidd did a fabulous job.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.447
You know, I met with Sonny.

33:42.127 --> 33:44.530
Just to finish the story with Sonny in case you're interested.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.232
No, no.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.496
It was sold in whenever it was.

33:49.816 --> 33:52.058
March or April or something.

33:52.078 --> 33:53.640
I didn't meet with him until August.

33:54.245 --> 34:02.095
We met in

34:02.682 --> 34:05.806
in the Bel Air Hotel for like six or eight hours.

34:06.547 --> 34:08.930
He flew directly from London to L.A.

34:08.970 --> 34:10.633
to meet with me, turned around and flew back.

34:11.834 --> 34:13.617
And it was in Georgia.

34:14.918 --> 34:22.989
But anyway, at that point, I said to him, he said, I'm going to start putting the cover into the, you know, cover design into the work.

34:23.069 --> 34:24.271
I said, what's it going to be?

34:24.732 --> 34:25.753
And he said, well,

34:26.189 --> 34:29.473
I'm fairly sure there won't be a gun on the cover.

34:29.533 --> 34:33.697
You know, and that's totally wrong.

34:33.797 --> 34:38.703
Now, have there been reviews yet?

34:38.843 --> 34:42.427
You should ask if you're interested.

34:42.567 --> 34:44.009
I am.

34:44.049 --> 34:46.371
We have a ton of desk.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.813
Okay.

34:48.474 --> 34:48.734
Great.

34:49.375 --> 34:50.456
Especially from PW.

34:51.377 --> 34:52.799
Great.

34:52.919 --> 34:54.981
The time's on it yet?

34:55.501 --> 34:59.625
How about the LA Times?

35:00.126 --> 35:01.947
Yeah, Charles Chandler.

35:01.987 --> 35:04.129
Did I get the LA Times?

35:04.149 --> 35:07.313
Yeah, he was very, very nice, very nice.

35:07.353 --> 35:13.078
Because that old Westlake, you know, I seem to be paired with him.

35:13.098 --> 35:14.359
They put you in the Westlake?

35:14.379 --> 35:15.941
I didn't interview you with him, I mentioned.

35:15.961 --> 35:18.523
Honestly, how do you get paired with Westlake?

35:18.543 --> 35:22.167
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

35:22.501 --> 35:42.608
I mean, you both have worked for... I can see, as an editor... Maybe that's enough to justify appearing.

35:42.668 --> 35:44.931
This is not a comic comic novel.

35:45.502 --> 35:47.945
And he had a wonderful quote.

35:48.566 --> 35:55.735
That's not helpful to me, you know, from my point of view.

35:55.775 --> 35:57.778
But anyway, he let off his column.

35:58.679 --> 36:01.482
It was really, really nice.

36:01.502 --> 36:03.825
Well, can I look it up?

36:03.845 --> 36:04.025
Yeah.

36:05.107 --> 36:08.671
I think, am I missing anything, or do you think I'm pretty well covered?

36:09.032 --> 36:10.293
I think you've got the story.

36:10.313 --> 36:12.036
You're going to weigh a thousand words.

36:12.056 --> 36:13.197
Oh, wow, that's a lot.
