00:02.917 --> 00:07.162
So if you could just identify yourself for the tape recorder, I'd appreciate it.

00:07.322 --> 00:08.383
I'm Vicki Reich.

00:08.403 --> 00:10.145
Okay, I'll just put this over your name, please.

00:10.325 --> 00:12.187
I'm a librarian.

00:12.868 --> 00:13.068
Hi.

00:13.148 --> 00:15.011
Hi, what's your name, Vicki?

00:15.191 --> 00:15.391
R-E-I-C-H.

00:15.411 --> 00:18.595
Okay, and Vicki is short for Victoria, or is Vicki from Vic?

00:18.935 --> 00:22.259
No, it's short for Victoria, but you may only call me that if you're angry.

00:22.479 --> 00:28.185
Well, if I use your name in an article, it probably should be... Vicki is just fine.

00:28.506 --> 00:29.667
Vicki is just fine.

00:35.030 --> 00:36.792
And what are you doing right now?

00:36.813 --> 00:51.673
Well, I have a number of responsibilities in the library, all centering around digital library projects and electronic publishing.

00:52.434 --> 00:54.557
Is this something I can access with my computer?

00:54.918 --> 00:55.539
Absolutely.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.401
And how would I do that?

00:57.802 --> 00:59.605
You have a Netscape browser?

00:59.625 --> 00:59.825
I do.

01:00.065 --> 01:02.208
Everything I'm going to show you, you can get to yourself.

01:03.570 --> 01:03.670
Okay.

01:03.690 --> 01:04.952
If you go to HiWire,

01:05.371 --> 01:06.913
It's .stanford.edu.

01:07.074 --> 01:08.175
And highwire is one word.

01:08.856 --> 01:08.997
Mm-hmm.

01:09.017 --> 01:09.838
Just like this.

01:09.858 --> 01:10.439
Mm-hmm.

01:10.459 --> 01:10.699
Yeah.

01:10.719 --> 01:13.744
And because I'm on the Stanford network, I don't have to type in the last one.

01:13.764 --> 01:16.388
Because it'll be a while before I transcribe this tape.

01:16.408 --> 01:17.310
It's highwire.

01:18.612 --> 01:18.772
Mm-hmm.

01:18.792 --> 01:19.713
What did you say?

01:19.733 --> 01:20.334
.stanford.

01:20.775 --> 01:21.356
Do you spell it?

01:21.396 --> 01:21.777
Stanford.

01:21.937 --> 01:22.297
Yes.

01:22.317 --> 01:22.518
Yeah.

01:22.538 --> 01:23.479
.edu.

01:23.559 --> 01:23.940
Yeah.

01:25.022 --> 01:26.003
And that'll take me right here.

01:26.063 --> 01:27.225
And that'll take you to this page.

01:27.786 --> 01:27.886
Yeah.

01:27.906 --> 01:29.729
And I should probably have two more ones.

01:29.749 --> 01:31.171
I'm doubted they should use the 28.8.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.255
That's what I think, right?

01:33.435 --> 01:33.555
Right.

01:35.476 --> 01:37.618
Did Mike talk to you about high wire?

01:38.559 --> 01:39.280
Yes, he did.

01:39.300 --> 01:39.961
Okay.

01:40.181 --> 01:41.623
So I'm just showing you what's here.

01:41.663 --> 01:42.463
Exactly.

01:42.483 --> 01:42.844
More or less.

01:42.944 --> 01:44.386
I don't have to give you the overview.

01:49.431 --> 01:50.052
Let's see.

01:51.813 --> 01:56.799
So he's told you why we're doing this and what journals we have up.

01:57.439 --> 02:02.665
So let me show you the first one we've put up.

02:02.932 --> 02:04.854
Journal of Biological Chemistry.

02:04.874 --> 02:15.043
Journal of Biological Chemistry has full text, including all images, since January 1995.

02:15.083 --> 02:26.995
Make sure that's right.

02:27.015 --> 02:30.458
And all the issues can be searched

02:32.041 --> 02:43.978
So if I wanted to find out all the times that someone had done experiments with mice and cancer, and I could do a search across the entire database and get up the full text.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.586
Or I can find information by browsing issue by issue.

02:49.727 --> 02:57.558
And so what I've done is I've gone to the table of contents here for the most current issue that we have up.

02:58.099 --> 02:59.601
23 August 96.

03:00.003 --> 03:00.444
Right.

03:00.464 --> 03:01.966
So that's about two weeks ago.

03:03.068 --> 03:03.308
Yes.

03:03.829 --> 03:18.450
Unfortunately, up until about three weeks ago, we were putting these up on cover date, and we had a technical glitch, and the last couple of issues haven't gone up on them, which is unfortunate.

03:18.470 --> 03:24.499
But by and large, the journals go up on the cover date.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.664
Did Mike show you a copy of the journal?

03:28.049 --> 03:30.151
The paper journal?

03:30.231 --> 03:31.052
No.

03:31.072 --> 03:32.413
Is this something I can take with me?

03:33.014 --> 03:33.334
No.

03:33.614 --> 03:33.895
Okay.

03:34.175 --> 03:42.003
Interesting, here we are on a computer.

03:42.023 --> 03:48.329
Over on the wall is a poster that says, Medieval Book of Lamentations, 1996.

03:48.349 --> 03:51.272
Is that an exhibition that was at Sanford?

03:53.214 --> 03:54.215
The Medieval Book?

03:54.675 --> 03:57.718
No, that's a calendar from a book sender.

03:58.036 --> 04:02.462
Anyway, this is the JVC in paper.

04:02.483 --> 04:05.006
It's six to nine hundred pages a week.

04:05.026 --> 04:05.427
I see.

04:05.487 --> 04:10.014
And I'm sorry, when you meant paper, I thought we were talking about paper.

04:10.034 --> 04:11.456
No, no, no.

04:11.756 --> 04:19.568
So you can see that for this particular journal, it becomes a lot more functional online.

04:19.588 --> 04:22.592
It's really, even in paper, it's really a database.

04:27.078 --> 04:29.442
It's basically written stone there, too.

04:29.502 --> 04:34.590
I mean, if somebody wanted to go in and modify or update, you can't do it on a printed page.

04:34.630 --> 04:35.712
You can't do his own thing, right.

04:36.293 --> 04:41.541
As happens so often in the scientific fields, I would imagine.

04:42.463 --> 04:42.583
Right.

04:43.504 --> 04:49.474
Well, and the other advantages for the online over the paper is that

04:51.108 --> 04:56.215
All of these figures and images originated as electronic files.

04:56.255 --> 05:07.792
For the biologists, one of the most important kind of data is this color, it's called gels, color gels.

05:08.313 --> 05:08.833
G-E-L-L-S?

05:09.034 --> 05:09.895
G-E-L-L-S.

05:09.915 --> 05:13.780
And you'll get it pointing to about a dozen or so.

05:14.361 --> 05:14.562
Right.

05:14.602 --> 05:17.326
They look like slides, actually.

05:17.346 --> 05:20.490
They're like slides, and they occur in the paper version.

05:20.977 --> 05:22.278
Every couple of pages.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.742
And these are all electronic.

05:26.202 --> 05:31.267
They're all done with electronic equipment, and then they get transformed into this.

05:31.387 --> 05:31.928
They're scanned, basically.

05:31.988 --> 05:34.690
They're scanned.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.074
So in the online... Are those available here, too?

05:38.094 --> 05:38.654
They are.

05:39.074 --> 05:40.095
You can price these up.

05:40.115 --> 05:50.005
In the online world, we can provide much better clarity because we can just attach the original files.

05:50.288 --> 05:55.873
Also, the color in the paper is very expensive, and the color online is just no different from the black and white.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.415
It's a little extra time to load it.

05:58.435 --> 05:59.737
So it's much better science.

06:00.818 --> 06:04.621
So here's the table of contents for the... That's an interesting line.

06:04.681 --> 06:06.062
Much better science.

06:06.122 --> 06:09.445
Much better science, yeah.

06:09.665 --> 06:19.114
Really, the point of HiWire is to help science communicate much better science, much better quality science.

06:20.444 --> 06:22.426
So let's go to the full text of an article.

06:23.387 --> 06:24.028
I have no idea.

06:24.388 --> 06:26.050
I can do this myself, too.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.171
I'm glad you show up.

06:27.231 --> 06:31.275
Actually, you don't have to spend an hour with me.

06:31.295 --> 06:32.416
Ten minutes would be fine.

06:32.436 --> 06:32.997
Okay, great.

06:33.337 --> 06:49.253
What I suggest you look at when you look at JVC is the different ways that we present the images, the fact that when you get to the references, we've linked all the references in the paper to the MEDLINE database.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.375
So if you wanted to find out... What did you call it?

06:52.395 --> 06:52.895
MEDLINE.

06:53.075 --> 06:54.377
M-E-E-L-I-N-E.

06:54.877 --> 06:59.101
That's an actual... Database that's... I understand.

06:59.121 --> 07:02.104
...that's housed with the National Organization.

07:02.124 --> 07:02.324
Okay.

07:02.344 --> 07:03.265
I am not familiar with it.

07:03.345 --> 07:04.646
I am computer literate, so it helps.

07:04.807 --> 07:05.187
Okay.

07:05.207 --> 07:05.407
Okay.

07:06.208 --> 07:06.528
Right.

07:06.608 --> 07:10.752
And so you can get at least to the abstracts of older articles.

07:10.772 --> 07:17.338
And as we bring more full text up online, we link from the references to full text wherever possible.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.020
Okay.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.871
Let's go back to HiWire.

07:26.614 --> 07:31.058
Okay, I'm going to show you one other thing that you just keep your eye open for when you browse.

07:33.880 --> 07:48.433
What's different about HiWire from other companies that are putting journals online is we understand the nuances of a particular journal or a particular magazine and how the audiences differ and how

07:48.667 --> 07:55.074
people use the science differently from one community, biological community to the next, even within biology.

07:55.094 --> 08:04.165
And so the journals themselves online have variations.

08:04.185 --> 08:17.340
Science, JVC, people want to browse and search equally because of the nature of the science and the nature of the text.

08:18.991 --> 08:28.383
Science, browsing is much more important than searching, and it's reflected in the way we've designed the interface.

08:28.443 --> 08:29.665
Browsing is much more important.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.648
Browsing is much more important.

08:32.309 --> 08:35.172
So the serendipity factor is pretty important.

08:35.273 --> 08:35.533
Yes.

08:36.134 --> 08:39.058
Well, you're familiar with Science Magazine?

08:39.078 --> 08:40.059
As a publication.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.260
As a publication, right.

08:41.601 --> 08:43.503
It's weekly, too, but it's thinner.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.748
It has more government policy.

08:46.768 --> 08:47.749
It has more news.

08:48.387 --> 08:51.290
It has a much wider audience.

08:51.350 --> 08:55.895
The paper is far more important than the paper that's here.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.037
And so the design is different.

08:59.119 --> 09:08.048
The design is more for more of a mass, I would not call it a mass audience, but more of a mass audience.

09:08.068 --> 09:12.753
If you want to do searching, you have to go down another level in the menu on the web.

09:14.635 --> 09:17.698
See, this is the same kind of search page that we have for J.B.

09:17.779 --> 09:18.259
Siebert.

09:18.577 --> 09:20.259
not as prominently placed.

09:21.401 --> 09:28.509
And the table of contents has a different layout.

09:29.310 --> 09:38.321
The bibliographic information is much more truncated, and we have buttons for people to get to the abstract.

09:38.402 --> 09:41.425
Why is your blank space on the right?

09:41.445 --> 09:44.729
Ah, here?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.812
When we design the screen,

09:48.142 --> 09:53.748
We found out that most science readers have very small monitors and are using a motor.

09:54.208 --> 09:59.513
And so we designed it for people who have smaller screens.

09:59.533 --> 10:04.278
I'm not a Windows user, so I don't know how to use... I don't know how to... I would shrink this.

10:04.718 --> 10:06.100
You would shrink it, yeah.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.183
Yeah, if I knew how to do it.

10:09.663 --> 10:12.066
And it's like this.

10:12.106 --> 10:12.526
Whoa!

10:12.927 --> 10:13.928
Yeah, that's what it is.

10:13.948 --> 10:16.410
That's as large as you're going to get it, I believe.

10:16.762 --> 10:22.130
Yeah, I wanted, you know, if I could, I would shrink it down, but since... You'd shrink it down even more?

10:22.511 --> 10:24.954
No, I would shrink, I would move this window over.

10:24.974 --> 10:25.936
Oh, I see.

10:25.956 --> 10:31.645
So that there wasn't all this wasted space and I could do other things on the water.

10:31.665 --> 10:31.985
Anyway.

10:33.067 --> 10:39.897
So you can see... There are lots of nuances of this.

10:39.957 --> 10:41.079
Okay, clearly.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.883
Okay, so...

10:45.196 --> 11:11.136
i think the other thing anybody can go on here it doesn't cost you anything right well gbc to get to the full text now requires a subscription but you can get to the abstracts and the table of contents and do the searching everyone on the web has access to that and it tells you you have to probably like getting a new year of time to subscribe if you want to get the end of the thing right and and so all the background information is really on this webpage and who we are and

11:12.753 --> 11:13.134
Okay.

11:13.235 --> 11:14.058
You know what?

11:14.078 --> 11:15.865
I'm going to run and try and catch this next train.

11:16.005 --> 11:16.608
Okay.

11:16.768 --> 11:18.254
I appreciate it.

11:18.274 --> 11:18.375
Okay.

11:18.395 --> 11:20.603
The other URL that Mike wanted you to look at.
