WEBVTT

00:06.241 --> 00:17.617
Okay, we're recording finally with Dr. Turner after some problems with the machinery, which I profoundly apologize.

00:18.579 --> 00:31.557
You had mentioned something about university presses usually operate by courtesy, and I thought that was a really exciting kind of an insight that you had offered, and I wondered if you could...

00:31.958 --> 00:39.946
University presses exist in universities.

00:40.627 --> 00:45.212
In most cases, universities are not going to subsidize them.

00:45.232 --> 00:51.819
They may to get them off the ground, or they may give them bridge money if there's a difficult period, but they don't usually subsidize.

00:53.080 --> 01:00.868
And so presses have to publish both what faculties and scholars want, and they've also got to publish things that are going to

01:01.388 --> 01:03.912
allow those other publications to take place.

01:05.735 --> 01:20.679
And my own sense, and you know this better, is that in the last 25 years university presses have been drawn more fully into the larger world of publication rather than just being there on their own.

01:23.484 --> 01:27.210
But going back to Yale, the

01:28.675 --> 01:31.879
You have a Chester Kerr hero, and you hear a lot about them.

01:32.861 --> 01:43.415
But I think the person who is really responsible for the press as it is today, and for the success as you define it as arguably the best university press in the country or the world, is John Ryden.

01:44.096 --> 01:46.980
And Ryden was as different from Chester as can be.

01:47.080 --> 01:54.430
I didn't know Chester well, but Chester was material, and he sought to be and was a kind of larger-than-life figure.

01:55.135 --> 02:04.165
Rydon just got the work done, and Rydon liked talented people, and he was willing to have talented people work who didn't get along with each other.

02:04.886 --> 02:06.447
That's a very interesting qualification.

02:06.668 --> 02:14.717
He wasn't afraid of having... He wasn't afraid of talent, but he also wasn't afraid of having a staff who, a lot of time, not liking each other.

02:14.757 --> 02:19.742
And my sense is that he was, he would, if he had an editor who was good,

02:20.903 --> 02:26.849
He would give that editor a lot of leash and allow for a lot of entrepreneurial work.

02:28.291 --> 02:39.923
And he was there long enough to create a culture, and he was there long enough to put into place business plans that actually are coming to fruition today.

02:40.804 --> 02:48.953
One of the things that happens in universities is universities, unlike businesses, there tends to be turnovers wherever anyone can be in a major position more than ten years.

02:49.675 --> 02:52.479
In many cases, much less than that.

02:52.499 --> 02:56.985
So John was there long enough, and he didn't think the press was all about him.

02:58.687 --> 03:00.730
Chester thought the press was all about him.

03:01.391 --> 03:02.372
Any number of quotes?

03:02.812 --> 03:04.114
Yeah.

03:04.194 --> 03:05.216
Absolutely expressing that.

03:05.236 --> 03:06.477
You don't ever feel like you're alone?

03:06.738 --> 03:07.078
No, no.

03:07.118 --> 03:10.182
People either liked Chester or didn't like him.

03:11.604 --> 03:17.472
But the other person that was enormously important, probably the most creative person at the press,

03:18.464 --> 03:19.586
Well, two.

03:19.726 --> 03:20.787
One in England, John Nichol.

03:21.388 --> 03:25.674
You'll have to pursue... That's really a major reason why I'm going there.

03:25.774 --> 03:26.695
Yeah, more about that.

03:27.376 --> 03:29.158
But the other was Ed Tripp, who's now dead.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.964
And Ed Tripp was an editor for a long, long time.

03:32.984 --> 03:34.025
He'd been in the city.

03:34.065 --> 03:37.069
He moved to New Haven.

03:37.970 --> 03:42.917
In part, something had happened in the city.

03:43.297 --> 03:48.184
And I think that actually his wife was badly mugged at some point.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.544
She was a very small, fragile woman.

03:53.365 --> 03:56.708
They came to New Haven, and Ed was here from the early 70s.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.770
I published my first book to Gale Press in 74.

03:58.850 --> 04:00.692
It was my dissertation.

04:00.772 --> 04:06.077
Ed had been here a little while, and he was here until he retired in the, I guess, early 90s.

04:07.499 --> 04:10.441
And he was a very odd duck.

04:11.562 --> 04:13.004
You can read the obituaries of him.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.205
I'll tell you a little bit about him.

04:14.742 --> 04:19.326
But he was very creative and could just generate ideas.

04:20.948 --> 04:24.871
My understanding is the Encyclopedia of New York was one of Ed's ideas.

04:25.011 --> 04:27.593
And he could just come up with ideas like that.

04:27.674 --> 04:28.474
Why don't we try this?

04:28.534 --> 04:29.435
Why don't we try that?

04:31.597 --> 04:42.707
It just spawned other encyclopedias, a similar kind of... Yeah, and Ed was a real kind of publisher's editor who just had

04:43.092 --> 04:46.255
all sorts of good ideas.

04:50.138 --> 04:57.425
He was one of the key people at the press in those years.

05:00.268 --> 05:10.517
The other thing that I think would be interesting about that are what are those areas of the press and the publication list where it particularly meshed

05:11.341 --> 05:13.644
with the university and where did it not.

05:14.245 --> 05:23.095
For example, it's had a long distinguished series on psychoanalysis and on things relating to child development.

05:23.135 --> 05:31.085
Because it was related to the Child Development Center, it was relating to the larger psychoanalytic community in New Haven, and New Haven has a very large psychoanalytic community.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.792
That whole area

05:37.396 --> 05:46.409
At one point, you would find that it was deeply related to the Yale English Department, probably from the 60s to about the early 80s.

05:49.633 --> 05:55.802
To find what were those series, it's taken the lead in history of art.

05:56.643 --> 06:05.175
It has also always had a very strong list, as I say always has been for a long time, on things relating to religion.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.006
history of religion, philosophy of religion, church history, and the like.

06:14.150 --> 06:17.575
So that would be, that's something to look at.

06:18.396 --> 06:24.003
When you say mischief... Are you saying basically it should, in a very general way, support the curriculum?

06:24.063 --> 06:24.544
No, no.

06:24.604 --> 06:34.036
Where were those parts of creative activity at the university that the press had an editor who, or editors, who latched into them?

06:34.717 --> 06:36.259
And so...

06:36.830 --> 06:38.452
I'm blanking on her name.

06:38.472 --> 06:44.020
There was a woman who was interested in psychoanalysis, and there's the whole series on psychoanalysis, which may be endowed for all I know.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.525
It would be worth finding what's serious, but things are endowed.

06:48.446 --> 06:58.520
There was a very strong series in that, and the Yale Child Study Center has been a very strong area for childhood development.

06:58.540 --> 07:03.247
And you had both books coming from that.

07:03.547 --> 07:05.790
Don...

07:07.475 --> 07:11.559
He died three or four years ago compared to the form of cancer.

07:14.002 --> 07:14.883
Anyway, Don Cohen.

07:15.183 --> 07:15.744
Don Cohen.

07:15.764 --> 07:21.991
Don Cohen was head of the Child Study Center, chaired the board for a long time, the publication committee.

07:22.011 --> 07:26.976
They've also, as I said, had a long history of publishing things having to do with religion.

07:29.119 --> 07:29.779
So what happens?

07:30.300 --> 07:33.043
Do you have this active program going?

07:33.580 --> 07:36.024
to get a start of publication?

07:36.244 --> 07:46.660
No, it's just, you have editors who are, Yale works through friendships, for the best kind, and editors who would cultivate people and then say, what's going on?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.903
It's interesting, and maybe we needed a series on this.

07:51.067 --> 08:02.524
Certainly in the last 10 years or so, the driving figure down there about whom people had very mixed feelings is Jonathan Brent.

08:03.112 --> 08:05.956
I had a wonderful interview with him last week.

08:05.976 --> 08:08.420
Yeah, John, as I say, I like John a lot.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.281
Not everyone does.

08:10.402 --> 08:15.470
John has been sort of light-hand trip.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.292
He's not as sweet as that.

08:17.673 --> 08:22.740
Not meaning to quote you directly on this, but why would people be turned up by Jonathan?

08:23.159 --> 08:27.004
Well, this is not for attribution, but just to give me a little bit.

08:27.064 --> 08:28.245
Jonathan is aggressive.

08:28.305 --> 08:30.228
He's not always generous to his colleagues.

08:30.348 --> 08:30.909
He's smart.

08:31.409 --> 08:35.154
He doesn't like things getting in his way.

08:35.174 --> 08:36.536
Not necessarily collegialism.

08:36.556 --> 08:38.358
Yeah, people have strong feelings about him.

08:38.378 --> 08:39.640
I've always liked him.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.702
But not everyone does.

08:43.264 --> 08:48.050
But there you've had somebody who's, you know, he spawned that series on communism.

08:48.911 --> 08:50.213
Which is fabulous.

08:50.817 --> 09:09.315
on your political viewpoint yes but but do not assume people in universities are neutral on these things i mean you know that series has upset a lot of apple carts i mean people would rather something i can quote you on uh people would rather live with their illusions it's great stuff

09:09.582 --> 09:10.904
These are great quotes, by the way.

09:10.924 --> 09:14.730
And all of which you've been recorded, I've placed a point out.

09:14.870 --> 09:18.355
You might, by the way, if I shoot a couple of snapshots of you while we're speaking.

09:18.415 --> 09:30.253
But my point is that a series like that has not always been welcomed by the, you know, either everyone at Yale or the larger academic community.

09:31.254 --> 09:36.282
But you've got to have editors like Grant or like Ed Tripp.

09:37.291 --> 09:50.933
who will push the envelope, and push the envelope in ways that mean that at the end of the day, you end up with a series of books that make a difference.

09:51.975 --> 09:54.419
And that's something that Tripp did, that's something that Brent has done.

09:54.979 --> 10:01.630
Another person I think you should interview is Judith Metro, who's now down at the National Gallery.

10:01.690 --> 10:03.433
She was the art editor for a long time.

10:04.257 --> 10:06.419
Very quiet woman.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.059
Very nice.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.161
I always liked her enormously.

10:09.181 --> 10:10.182
The art editor here.

10:10.202 --> 10:12.084
She was our editor here for a time.

10:12.104 --> 10:17.148
Because the art program, as I understand it, really got its thrust from London.

10:17.228 --> 10:18.549
It was in both, I think.

10:18.769 --> 10:28.257
I mean, it's... The press has always done a lot with British art because of its relationship with Paul Mellon Center in London.

10:30.339 --> 10:34.062
And that, if you're in London, you're going to want to talk to Brian Allen at the Paul Mellon Center.

10:36.640 --> 10:43.187
And you see, the things that make presses work and so forth, I don't know whether you can make good copy out of it.

10:43.528 --> 10:53.159
It's people really doing their jobs and working with authors and cultivating authors and just maybe staying in touch.

10:53.299 --> 10:59.526
So when finally the author has a manuscript, well, I'm going to bring it to Yale rather than bringing it to someplace else.

10:59.877 --> 11:06.003
You used a phrase earlier, when the machine was not functioning, a phrase you called, but you used was creative tension.

11:06.023 --> 11:07.705
And I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on that.

11:07.725 --> 11:08.285
What do you mean by that?

11:08.606 --> 11:22.539
Well, there's creative tension in the fact that university presses, faculties expect university presses to publish faculty scholarship, not just Yale scholarship, but scholarship with people like us.

11:23.420 --> 11:28.365
People's dissertations, people's monographs, books that, you know,

11:28.733 --> 11:31.939
wouldn't possibly have a chance in the trade market.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.264
And that's one of the things university presses do.

11:34.284 --> 11:37.570
They publish books that sell a few hundred copies.

11:37.751 --> 11:38.873
And you think that is a mission?

11:38.893 --> 11:40.035
Oh, I think it is a mission.

11:40.055 --> 11:40.937
I feel that very strongly.

11:40.957 --> 11:43.502
I also think they have to publish books that are going to pay for those.

11:43.685 --> 11:46.929
And some of my colleagues on the faculty would disagree with that.

11:47.871 --> 11:50.214
I'm among the least pure of these.

11:50.254 --> 11:52.517
I think you've got to be both.

11:52.797 --> 12:00.908
I mean, does it please you that the press has operated two years in a row in the black, for instance, which is quite an extraordinary achievement for a university press?

12:00.928 --> 12:01.268
Yeah.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.012
That's 300 plus titles a year.

12:04.032 --> 12:09.439
No, I think, I mean, I believe that, you see, I believe the press should operate in the black.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.053
at least over, say, a course of every three years.

12:13.073 --> 12:16.858
I mean, you will have years just because of sales and the fact you're in the market.

12:16.878 --> 12:23.827
I mean, after a commercial operation, if you can have a bad year because the economy goes to hell, one of the first things people can stop buying are books.

12:27.251 --> 12:37.084
But a press, I think, has a mission to publish things that do not have a natural commercial market, that have scholarly integrity and importance.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.168
And there can be

12:40.705 --> 12:41.706
differences on that.

12:41.766 --> 12:49.496
I think in the humanities in the last 20 years, some areas of the humanities have almost put themselves out of business by becoming writing only for each other.

12:50.116 --> 12:59.267
So I think there has to be, you know, there has to be, the books have to address genuinely important questions, but they may not have a commercial market.

13:00.569 --> 13:08.939
And then it should publish those books that have integrity that do have this adequate commercial market.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.020
Well, when you think of

13:10.625 --> 13:17.695
the great books, these monumental projects in the Benjamin Franklin papers, for instance.

13:18.857 --> 13:22.382
The first title in that series sold 8,500 copies.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.147
The most recent, 650 copies.

13:26.167 --> 13:34.118
Now, does that mean that the Franklin series has an uncertain future, or do you still think that the press has a commitment?

13:34.553 --> 13:36.736
Well, I think it should be completed.

13:36.756 --> 13:38.258
As a printed book series?

13:38.298 --> 13:42.082
Yeah, I think it should be completed as a printed book series.

13:42.463 --> 13:48.210
I think that the National Endowment for Humanities and some other people should get in there and subsidize it.

13:48.290 --> 13:55.679
But yes, I think these are the sorts of things that commitments were made now in all the Founding Father projects.

13:55.719 --> 14:01.426
They all became longer and more complicated than anyone else ever thought they would be.

14:02.528 --> 14:04.510
And the fashions of scholarship have changed.

14:05.418 --> 14:15.012
On the other hand, whereas in the 1970s and 80s, there was only a little bit of scholarship on sale of Franklin, in the last two or three years, four or five books have come out of Franklin.

14:15.293 --> 14:18.377
So it may well be that the sales will pick up a little bit.

14:18.397 --> 14:19.559
But the dynamic has changed.

14:19.619 --> 14:29.393
Once upon a time, every book published by Yale University Press was certain to be sold to libraries.

14:29.413 --> 14:33.499
That's no longer the case, especially where you have consortia like the college library systems.

14:33.519 --> 14:33.940
That's right.

14:34.122 --> 14:34.502
That's right.

14:34.522 --> 14:41.750
I mean, the whole system depended on a certain kind of financing of guaranteed sales.

14:42.751 --> 14:46.075
And that's no longer the case.

14:46.115 --> 14:53.162
So that's why I think in order to produce some of these other books, I have no trouble in the press publishing other books that sell.

14:53.182 --> 14:57.447
But you have to have certain books, like the Artbook series, for instance, which has come along.

14:58.405 --> 15:02.271
One hesitates to use the phrase cash cow, but nevertheless it has.

15:02.291 --> 15:06.258
Sure, it at the moment is, and that too will pass at some point.

15:06.919 --> 15:08.281
I don't know, the art books are fabulous.

15:08.421 --> 15:11.566
Oh, they're fabulous, but I mean... They're the best by far.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.090
Nothing in life is permanent.

15:14.251 --> 15:21.142
And this too will... Yeah, what did John Chance always say, you know, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

15:21.202 --> 15:22.243
Yeah, that's right.

15:22.263 --> 15:25.729
Figuring out what your life is going to come to.

15:28.207 --> 15:45.347
So, the other thing historically in the press would be to watch the shape of the lisp, which early on tended to be very much concentrated in the humanities and has now moved out over the years in numerous other areas, reference works and the like.

15:45.367 --> 15:49.692
Yeah, you mentioned that there has been some disquietude in the ranks over the

15:50.212 --> 16:01.407
animals of communism series, do you see a similar kind of dichotomy with the China book that seems to have run across a difficult patch?

16:02.889 --> 16:04.871
I don't know enough about that difficult patch.

16:04.971 --> 16:10.559
I wouldn't see the same thing, because there's not the same ideological problem.

16:10.719 --> 16:20.151
The opening of the Soviet archives and getting these materials is

16:20.587 --> 16:24.211
has begun to make people rethink the history of the 20th century.

16:25.372 --> 16:30.438
The 20th century is not a comfortable century to think about.

16:32.400 --> 16:38.827
Here you are, director of this, one of the truly great rare books and manuscript libraries in the world.

16:39.608 --> 16:47.337
Do you see any kind of a connection between what the press does and what you do here?

16:47.857 --> 16:51.744
I'd like to say there is, but I don't think there is greatly.

16:51.844 --> 17:10.759
I've toyed with the idea of talking with John of whether there could be, and the press could have a Beinecke series that would involve... Well, no, I'm thinking of books that were written out of Beinecke collections of some kind that we could help finance.

17:11.127 --> 17:18.155
Republishing research that's been largely done with the collections here.

17:18.936 --> 17:20.378
But he and I really haven't.

17:20.738 --> 17:25.524
He and I arrived at the same time, and both of us have lots of other things to do.

17:25.564 --> 17:39.480
Perhaps even publishing previously unpublished... You must have tons of things in the collection that haven't been... I've got some of you on copyright problems with 20th century manuscripts and so forth.

17:39.899 --> 17:51.235
One could imagine taking a certain number of books and doing an edition of beautifully produced books and so forth, if there were a market.

17:51.255 --> 17:54.540
I mean, the real challenge for all of this is going to be where the digital world goes.

17:54.620 --> 17:54.981
Yeah.

17:55.181 --> 18:04.354
One of the great, great success stories of the press is the publication of One Day's Journey of Tonight, which Random House felt

18:05.212 --> 18:12.604
Duke, and Cerf had given his word to Eugene O'Neill that he wouldn't do it, but then Carlisle, you know, decided that she wanted it.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.024
That's right.

18:13.245 --> 18:18.894
Published, and now he doesn't feel a surprise, but he becomes an enormous bestseller for the press.

18:19.294 --> 18:22.620
Well, and it generated a great deal of money for other parts of the university as well.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.483
And again, it's a manuscript that's here.

18:24.963 --> 18:30.072
I'm wondering if there are other similar kinds of things.

18:30.112 --> 18:32.856
Well, that was a very special case.

18:33.663 --> 18:35.005
Probably not immediately.

18:35.586 --> 18:40.292
Probably not immediately.

18:40.312 --> 18:43.337
Now, you sat on the publication committee, I believe, for the press?

18:43.437 --> 18:44.318
Twice.

18:44.779 --> 18:55.594
Tell me a little bit about that, and why you... Well, the material comes to... In fact, this is where you'll find that this is one of the things that's in the Jamadeh article.

19:02.403 --> 19:03.585
The publication committee...

19:04.561 --> 19:07.204
basically discuss manuscripts as presented.

19:08.165 --> 19:10.767
Most of the legwork, not all of the legwork, has been done.

19:10.827 --> 19:14.851
Almost everything goes through the publication committee.

19:14.871 --> 19:16.913
Very little was ever actually turned back.

19:16.933 --> 19:20.437
It has a pretty bad proposal for it to be turned back.

19:21.358 --> 19:31.868
It does, if the director wishes it to, it can provide a good gatekeeping function.

19:35.257 --> 19:42.826
So that he can say to the editors, well, you know, this has to get through the publication committee, so it better not be a turkey of the manuscript.

19:44.709 --> 19:49.334
No editor likes to hear a particularly sprightly discussion of the manuscript.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.558
They want to have the manuscript accepted right now.

19:54.481 --> 19:56.543
In most cases, it will be.

19:57.324 --> 19:59.627
Usually there are some...

20:01.312 --> 20:29.968
some suggestions made, but that is that is different over the years how much cloud publication the committee actually has. It's in part how much the how much the direct how much clout the director wants it to have, because if you have a situation where the committee turns down every third manuscript, you've so demoralized your editors that they just can't they just can't function. When you were the provost the chief academic officer of the university, when you were seated in that chair, how did you view the press?

20:30.404 --> 20:35.471
I mean, it is a division, a department of universities.

20:35.611 --> 20:38.615
Well, the press did very well on those years.

20:38.915 --> 20:50.691
Those were the years that we were able to get money from Ned Evans for the new wing, which was, I think, very important just for the way it functioned.

20:51.650 --> 21:01.604
Our concern then was to see that the press did operate in the black, because in those days, I was provost during what I called the first Bush recession.

21:02.726 --> 21:07.993
The university was not nearly as wealthy as it is today, by a long shot.

21:08.013 --> 21:14.943
I mean, the endowment in 1986 or 7... In 20 years?

21:15.023 --> 21:16.285
Is that dramatic?

21:16.526 --> 21:16.866
Yes.

21:16.886 --> 21:20.391
In 1987, the endowment was about a billion, a little over a billion dollars.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.973
1992 was up to a little over three.

21:22.993 --> 21:24.035
It's now around 14.

21:25.416 --> 21:29.702
And this raises all ships.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.788
That's extraordinary.

21:34.289 --> 21:35.150
It's quite extraordinary.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.273
It's one of the most important things that's happened in the history of Yale.

21:38.775 --> 21:42.040
Yale was always badly unrefinanced until this last rise.

21:42.741 --> 21:44.684
We were in the Harvard and MIT.

21:45.765 --> 21:50.732
Well, we were, but in the 70s and early 80s, Yale fell badly behind.

21:51.252 --> 21:58.440
And the story of the Yale Endowment in the last 15 years is one of the major stories of American higher education.

21:58.920 --> 22:04.126
And what, in a nutshell, is this extraordinary explosive growth attributed to it?

22:04.146 --> 22:14.938
It's attributed to the management of David Swenson, who came here in the mid-'80s and has managed it with an investment committee since then, being in the right things at the right time, going into alternative investments.

22:15.619 --> 22:18.762
But I can give you an idea, in 1992,

22:19.180 --> 22:23.065
The university was drawing into the vicinity of 80-some million dollars from the endowment.

22:23.185 --> 22:24.547
It's now drawing over a year.

22:24.847 --> 22:26.509
It's now drawing over 400 million.

22:27.110 --> 22:27.751
It makes a difference.

22:27.771 --> 22:30.855
That changes things.

22:31.416 --> 22:40.868
This institution was very cash-strapped 25 years ago, and now it's in a very strong position, of course, with the endowment.

22:41.742 --> 22:47.207
I don't know how that fits into a history of the press, from my standpoint, but it must.

22:47.287 --> 22:48.888
It must have some very much.

22:49.169 --> 22:51.230
Well, any endowment income.

22:51.250 --> 23:01.840
I mean, I can tell you, I made a, established a publication, a small publication, funded the press, my parents' memory, about 1995 or so.

23:01.860 --> 23:06.104
My mother wasn't dead if it didn't fit for my parents.

23:06.124 --> 23:11.108
And since then, it's tripled its value.

23:11.493 --> 23:16.881
So, any of their endowment funds have gone up.

23:17.442 --> 23:19.144
The press has become more international.

23:19.204 --> 23:21.007
The university has become more international.

23:21.027 --> 23:26.455
In some ways, it took the lead in that with the London office.

23:27.196 --> 23:29.940
When I was provost, we were concerned.

23:30.325 --> 23:35.899
that the press operate in the black, because in those days we really didn't have money to die.

23:35.919 --> 23:37.082
Did it operate in the black?

23:37.162 --> 23:39.729
Yeah, it was operating in the black.

23:39.769 --> 23:47.288
No, it has its up years and down years, because in a recessionary environment, people are not going to buy

23:47.740 --> 23:49.462
$75 art books.

23:49.482 --> 23:53.387
But if there are three or four university presses that can ever say that, I'd be amazed.

23:53.868 --> 23:55.069
I wonder how many can actually say that.

23:55.089 --> 23:59.094
Well, you should talk to Ryden about that, about the financial side.

23:59.114 --> 24:00.255
I have, actually.

24:00.896 --> 24:02.478
I mean, but that was one of our concerns.

24:02.759 --> 24:13.131
There was concern how the building was going to be financed and how they could they use university borrowing and the like.

24:13.292 --> 24:15.294
Those were concerns.

24:16.035 --> 24:16.836
It's also

24:17.440 --> 24:25.113
I don't know when this started, but it's for some time had relationships with major publishers in New York who've served on various committees and the like.

24:25.233 --> 24:34.188
And that's, again, it's allowed the press to be drawn into the larger world of commercial publishing.

24:34.208 --> 24:41.119
And it's no longer this little clubby thing that, as it was once upon a time, it's a big...

24:41.335 --> 24:43.978
Oh, yeah, it's a big... It's got a lot of people working there.

24:43.998 --> 24:46.620
Yeah, it's got a lot of people working there.

24:47.241 --> 24:58.913
But remember, when you say clubby, I mean, universities tended to be, the private research universities tended to be a little clubby, and I suppose before the 50s and even into the 50s and 60s.

24:59.934 --> 25:00.975
That's just the way it was.

25:01.555 --> 25:03.097
I mean, that was the way it was.

25:03.357 --> 25:05.259
It was not that they sort of sought to be clubby.

25:05.279 --> 25:06.660
It was just the way it was.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.461
I was having...

25:07.812 --> 25:12.076
lunch with a female colleague who just retired at the Graduate Club last week.

25:13.378 --> 25:21.206
She said, you know, she grew up in New Haven, she said, I can remember when I wasn't allowed in this dining room and it was allowed in the ladies' room, on the ladies' dining room on the side.

25:21.626 --> 25:26.511
She said, you know, at the time I thought there was nothing wrong with it.

25:26.532 --> 25:28.954
She's actually a very strong feminist.

25:30.035 --> 25:37.583
The world of Harvard and Yale and the like, through the 50s and the early 60s,

25:37.934 --> 25:51.190
It was a much, much smaller world, and universities didn't have as much money, so that it was a reflection of a larger university culture.

25:51.631 --> 26:07.570
I'm not defending it, but I think historically, thinking historically, and that's basically what I do, is to think about what was that world, and university presses, though it may function in a kind of clubby way, were also a way of trying to push through that.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.373
that clubby world.

26:10.733 --> 26:17.161
So if you take the Franklin papers, that was intermissioned with a great national project.

26:17.181 --> 26:19.364
I mean, the Founding Fathers Projects.

26:20.465 --> 26:23.408
They produced an awful lot of books, and they got a lot more to do.

26:23.729 --> 26:32.359
But they were a way that the press and the university was intermissioned with a great post-war agenda, which was the

26:32.592 --> 26:36.857
celebration and understanding of the emergence of liberal democracy.

26:37.958 --> 26:41.783
And the founding fathers said, I couldn't be able to do that.

26:41.803 --> 26:53.537
So that if you look at those, those are not to be seen as sort of narrow, effete projects, but they were, in the world of scholarship, those were exciting and hadn't been done.

26:54.678 --> 26:56.220
The vision, we are going to publish,

26:56.740 --> 27:07.414
You know, 150 years after, roughly 150 years after they're gone, 125 years after Jefferson and Adams are gone, we are going to publish all of these papers.

27:07.494 --> 27:11.199
Now, you know, the ambition may have been too broad.

27:11.219 --> 27:12.861
They thought they could do it too fast.

27:12.921 --> 27:15.204
They thought the money would be there forever.

27:15.244 --> 27:19.490
They didn't realize... Well, look, we saw the electronic alternative either, I think.

27:19.510 --> 27:21.593
What were the electronic alternative?

27:21.613 --> 27:25.498
What changed was the culture that turned against

27:26.896 --> 27:32.865
That's celebration of American civic life from the Vietnam War on.

27:32.886 --> 27:40.157
Those projects were conceived at a moment of great national confidence in the post-war years.

27:41.359 --> 27:45.025
And they were great civic projects, and they were national projects.

27:45.065 --> 27:47.048
So for a press to say they were going to do that,

27:47.602 --> 27:54.353
was for a press and university to commit themselves to a great national project, a great national civic project.

27:54.373 --> 28:01.444
And it was just that they had trouble as the civic culture changed, and then the ambitions of that they're going to publish every laundry list, so to speak, there.

28:01.464 --> 28:02.486
Yeah.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.469
You have to come have some kind of judgment.

28:04.489 --> 28:08.877
Yale has yet to generate an entirely electronic book.

28:08.897 --> 28:12.883
I think it maybe has been one CD or something, but basically it hasn't.

28:13.403 --> 28:19.110
Do you think that that's a direction that will be pursued at some point, looking ahead to the second stage?

28:19.130 --> 28:20.632
It's probably inevitable.

28:20.652 --> 28:21.393
Probably inevitable.

28:21.413 --> 28:23.436
What it's going to mean, I actually don't know.

28:23.456 --> 28:30.585
I ask this as if you are custodian in order of a great... We worry about how we're going to deal with these things.

28:31.165 --> 28:41.098
Like the digital world, every time you digitize an image, you create the necessity of having to create a new bibliographic record.

28:41.281 --> 28:44.645
Well, I mean, one, when you're asked, will Yale do that, the answer is yes.

28:44.665 --> 28:47.669
And the reason is, Yale Press is part of Yale University.

28:47.809 --> 28:54.938
And as a colleague of mine now, deceased, once said, Yale is just exactly like the rest of the United States, only more so.

28:57.882 --> 28:59.424
And that's... That's a great quote.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.167
And this was a fellow named Terry Muskemin.

29:02.928 --> 29:03.909
And... What's the last name?

29:04.030 --> 29:04.390
Muskemin.

29:05.371 --> 29:08.335
And the point of it is that...

29:08.753 --> 29:26.869
The Harvards, the Yales, the Princetons, the Stanfords, take the top dozen, public and private research universities, are actually deeply embedded in American society and civic life and reflect where that society and establishment is at the moment.

29:26.889 --> 29:28.030
Now they always lag.

29:28.731 --> 29:30.532
Universities rarely lead.

29:31.353 --> 29:35.136
In fact, they get into trouble when they think they're supposed to lead because they're not very good at it.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.119
Universities like

29:38.858 --> 29:45.790
Church are inherently conserving and conservative institutions, whatever the politics of faculties and so forth.

29:45.810 --> 29:52.822
They're essentially conserving institutions, and they sort of look out and see where the society is going, and they move in that direction.

29:53.363 --> 29:58.773
And so, in terms of publishing, sure, they will move in that direction.

29:58.793 --> 30:00.836
You mentioned digitizing.

30:00.856 --> 30:03.641
They probably won't, but Yale Press probably won't define what that means.

30:03.762 --> 30:04.022
Exactly.

30:04.255 --> 30:12.906
And just unrelated to the press, but are you, for instance, the University of Texas, HRC is, I guess, digitizing all of their manuscripts.

30:12.947 --> 30:15.089
Are you involved in anything like that here?

30:15.109 --> 30:18.113
We don't have a project that large.

30:18.153 --> 30:23.100
In fact, one of the problems with digitizing some 20th century things are the copyright issues.

30:24.021 --> 30:27.966
But you don't have exclusively 20th century things here?

30:28.187 --> 30:28.407
No.

30:28.707 --> 30:34.737
digitizing medieval things and the like, and there's a large digital library that you can... But are there unique objects?

30:34.777 --> 30:36.700
Are you making archival copies of them?

30:38.022 --> 30:41.348
Yeah, we are, and we will be doing more of that.

30:41.848 --> 30:43.431
And making that accessible?

30:43.491 --> 30:44.433
One's accessible right now.

30:44.453 --> 30:49.942
I mean, there are literally thousands of images that we have accessible at the moment.

30:50.042 --> 30:53.888
It's unclear to me how much access is being made to.

30:55.285 --> 31:07.724
If you take an interesting digital project called Early Books Online, Early English Books, almost everything published in English up to 1800 has been digitized in some form or another.

31:07.744 --> 31:10.869
They have about 500 items they want, most of which are broad-sized.

31:10.929 --> 31:15.917
I'll tell you what they're down to at this point.

31:15.937 --> 31:23.689
How many people at Grinnell College are using that is unclear.

31:24.479 --> 31:27.323
great desire to digitize, and it's going to be done.

31:28.104 --> 31:34.954
And you have some administrators in some places, and you have some state legislators who think, well, you're never going to have to buy another book.

31:37.037 --> 31:39.280
First of all, these databases are expensive to buy.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.644
They're expensive to keep up.

31:41.664 --> 31:43.446
They can disappear overnight.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.730
They're as good as the charges on their CDs.

31:46.891 --> 31:50.316
What you really would like is good 17th century French paper.

31:51.919 --> 31:53.541
But it will be done.

31:53.993 --> 31:57.117
What that's going to mean is not yet clear.

31:58.219 --> 32:23.815
Because there's a great and very, I think, very interesting, having just been in this business two years, disconnect between the amount of data or information that is available online in free databases, in databases that you have to subscribe to in the life, like Early English Books Online is a subscription database.

32:25.465 --> 32:33.514
and the capacity of students and faculty to use them, because they are not easy to use in every case.

32:34.996 --> 32:46.508
And the curious thing is that what students and faculty do at the moment is use Google, which sort of has all of the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

32:47.510 --> 32:52.435
And the disconnect is how do we find ways

32:52.820 --> 33:00.130
so that scholars and readers and students actually can use these materials with some facility.

33:01.752 --> 33:07.740
Well, I'm often curious as to how many undergraduates, for instance, use Bionic.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.123
I can't imagine that it's very many.

33:10.144 --> 33:10.905
There are quite a few.

33:11.005 --> 33:12.326
Yeah, there are quite a few.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.029
We have classes that come in here.

33:14.630 --> 33:16.072
We build classrooms for that.

33:17.073 --> 33:22.320
Freshmen, as soon as a freshman matriculates at Yale, they can use the Bionic.

33:22.992 --> 33:37.836
The only person of consequence I've ever met, and he lives here in New Haven, who told me that he chose the school he would attend, and he was admitted to both Harvard and Yale, and Bill Reeves books up here in New Haven.

33:38.136 --> 33:38.918
He chose Yale.

33:39.258 --> 33:44.747
I've never heard an undergraduate, a matriculating undergraduate say he chose a university

33:45.031 --> 33:49.075
because of its special collections, and particularly in Western America.

33:49.316 --> 33:58.286
Probably not the first thing to cross, but we have, in terms of numbers, I think undergraduate is the single largest number of years.

33:58.306 --> 33:58.766
Yeah, that's fabulous.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.268
And we keep trying to increase that.

34:02.170 --> 34:05.834
What would you be interested in seeing in a centennial?

34:05.854 --> 34:09.778
I'm not necessarily going to call this a history, by the way, because that's boring.

34:09.798 --> 34:12.321
I don't think I can do it in 50,000 words.

34:12.689 --> 34:19.656
but I think this is going to be kind of a selective consideration, basically driven by narrative and profiles and discussions.

34:21.418 --> 34:26.784
What is it that you would most like to see considered in a consideration of the press's first hundred years?

34:27.584 --> 34:32.630
Only modest attention to the directors.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.972
Which is probably going to be the case, actually.

34:34.992 --> 34:40.738
Yeah, I mean, a lot of institutional histories that the directors are the equivalent.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.329
I'd nose around and see what you can find out about the editors.

34:45.731 --> 34:49.916
I'd look at some of the series, particularly some of the series outside the humanities.

34:51.398 --> 34:54.603
In particular for... Well, the psychoanalytic series.

34:54.663 --> 34:55.744
What did you mention earlier?

34:55.925 --> 34:56.345
Yeah, those.

34:57.587 --> 35:04.296
I would not get lost in predicting where publishing is going because it would be inevitably long.

35:04.316 --> 35:06.779
Oh, that's predictions of a mistake.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.443
I would find out, have there been any...

35:09.811 --> 35:12.576
who have been, if any, significant donors to the press?

35:13.797 --> 35:20.108
The one thing I think the press has not done as good a job as it should do is raising money.

35:20.248 --> 35:22.492
There's no bell map, for instance, as Harvard has.

35:22.592 --> 35:24.174
Yeah, that's right.

35:24.755 --> 35:34.992
I think that, and I don't know whether or not the university was trying to give it donors and so forth, it doesn't matter, but I think that if the press over the years had worked harder

35:35.647 --> 35:46.305
To build an endowment, it would then have to worry less about operating in the black because it would be sustained by an endowment.

35:46.325 --> 35:56.001
If it were sustained by an endowment, it could define its own mission more independently than having to be dependent on the market.

35:56.141 --> 35:56.862
What is the mission?

35:57.044 --> 35:58.626
I mean, you've mentioned mission.

35:58.666 --> 36:01.790
Should the press have a mission, a vision statement?

36:01.850 --> 36:09.060
I don't know, a vision statement, but I think it has to have a clearer view than it and other university presses do at the moment.

36:09.080 --> 36:14.267
University presses at the moment are all in great challenges.

36:14.407 --> 36:25.262
Yale's doing very well, but it has very sprightly conversations in-house and with the Publication Committee and elsewhere about what it should be publishing.

36:26.356 --> 36:53.410
one of the things is that the this world of libraries buying books and so forth it was in my day when i was starting in the profession it was assumed if you had written a good dissertation not any dissertation but if you'd written a good dissertation you would find a publisher in a major university press your book would probably in those days sell maybe 1500 two thousand copies okay that's a lot

36:53.525 --> 36:57.069
Well, it was, I think, my first book, which wasn't anywhere, was a best-seller.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.172
I think it's still around 1,500 and only a couple thousand.

36:59.192 --> 37:01.555
I may be mistaken on that, but I think it's still 1,500.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.096
But there were enough libraries.

37:03.477 --> 37:04.598
See, that came out in 1974.

37:04.658 --> 37:08.983
That was the heyday of the expansion of libraries and community colleges and so forth.

37:09.925 --> 37:10.986
There had been 1,200.

37:11.006 --> 37:15.792
I mean, it wasn't 500.

37:15.952 --> 37:22.840
And it was part of the structure and culture of the American Academy that young scholars would be published by university presses.

37:23.123 --> 37:29.892
those books would then be reviewed and their worth as a scholar would be judged on that.

37:29.912 --> 37:36.882
Well, as costs have gone up and as the libraries aren't buying, that system runs into trouble.

37:36.902 --> 37:48.878
You tie that to some of the problems in the humanities, where the humanities have become, in some cases, arcane, and they're writing only for themselves, not even for the whole, whether it's over-specialization,

37:49.685 --> 38:02.402
And that system, of which university presses were a clear part and understood themselves to be a part, is not in a state of collapse, but it's not very healthy right now.

38:02.942 --> 38:13.736
And there are fields of scholarship that just inevitably will not have large sales, that are not necessarily arcane.

38:14.918 --> 38:18.763
Certain areas of Judaic studies or Near Eastern studies

38:19.098 --> 38:29.888
certain kinds of intellectual history, which are well done and not narrow methodologically, but to just not appeal, that these places should be, this kind of scholarship should be published.

38:31.369 --> 38:35.073
And I think it's a role of the university press to publish those.

38:35.093 --> 38:39.717
Now, how it finances it, its sources of financing are pretty straightforward.

38:40.218 --> 38:45.983
You either, the book helps support itself by the demand in the market for it,

38:46.655 --> 38:55.787
so you make a market-driven thing, or you publish other books for which there are markets that subsidize them, or you go out and get endowments.

38:55.807 --> 39:02.116
And I'm setting aside, because I know there's other subsidies, because of those occasions, you'll find a foundation subsidy, but those are small.

39:02.136 --> 39:06.962
I mean, the Lefty Lewis projects are definitely a thing.

39:06.982 --> 39:07.983
Those are probably going to be a thing.

39:08.204 --> 39:09.826
Which is a great story in its own right.

39:09.846 --> 39:14.071
Yeah, and those projects now are digital projects.

39:14.091 --> 39:14.552
And then just

39:14.785 --> 39:15.866
Once again, briefly?

39:15.886 --> 39:16.887
I'm going to have to go.

39:16.947 --> 39:17.988
Okay, then briefly.

39:18.009 --> 39:20.892
Just tell me, briefly, again, the thrust of the Giamatti piece.

39:22.173 --> 39:28.880
It was an argument that Ed Tripp, I don't disagree with, that Bart was arguing about how much faculty influence there was in the University Press.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.342
And I remember Ed saying, it's just not true.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.084
It all comes to the Publication Committee.

39:32.104 --> 39:32.825
It's prepackaged.

39:33.125 --> 39:33.986
Mm-hmm.

39:35.007 --> 39:36.088
Fabulous.

39:36.288 --> 39:37.690
I guess we could wrap up.

39:38.571 --> 39:40.573
And then, just to

39:40.891 --> 39:48.203
expand maybe for 30 seconds why you think a look at, say, the psychoanalytic series would be interesting?

39:48.223 --> 39:49.505
Well, it's not the first thing.

39:49.545 --> 39:58.560
It's been an important series connected to the Yale community, because there's a large psychoanalytic community in Yale.

39:58.721 --> 40:01.245
But that would almost justify its existence, wouldn't it?

40:01.385 --> 40:04.290
And also to the Yale Child Study Center.

40:04.350 --> 40:06.814
So it's a classic case

40:07.385 --> 40:14.124
of scholarship that related to what was going on in the university.

40:15.146 --> 40:18.796
I apologize for the... If you want to talk again, come back.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.942
This has really been excellent.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.048
Everything is run...
