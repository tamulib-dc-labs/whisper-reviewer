WEBVTT

00:01.921 --> 00:04.044
We're talking about preservation.

00:04.064 --> 00:07.549
You said preserving is important, but you had a caveat there.

00:07.769 --> 00:16.322
Yeah, because I was talking to a restorator who came to see me at a fair.

00:17.023 --> 00:21.589
And he said, well, yes, he is doing that restoration work.

00:21.629 --> 00:26.456
And I said, well, what are you restoring now?

00:26.596 --> 00:30.542
And he said, well, I just sort of frog.

00:31.163 --> 00:31.303
Yeah.

00:31.975 --> 01:01.223
I just finished restoring a 19th century journal which is a very cheap journal and you can buy these in ancient bookshops for 400 or 500 D mark two or three volumes and here we stored one volume over a span of two months and it cost

01:01.658 --> 01:07.168
the library or the one who paid for the restoration, nearly 10,000 demar.

01:07.428 --> 01:12.617
I mean, here you see what makes sense in restoring and what not.

01:13.639 --> 01:25.540
And I really would say one should be very careful in these things, because lots of books from the 19th and from the 20th century

01:25.925 --> 01:53.535
they still exist in huge quantities and let's let it be said some of them don't even deserve to be preserved well of course i'm a bit i'm a bit highbrow on that but nevertheless one should really concentrate on the books that really deserve and need restoration there's a fire yeah there's a fire they

01:54.106 --> 02:06.065
There's a small farm there and they seem to burn things.

02:06.105 --> 02:12.314
It's a pity that you don't see the landscape here because it's very nice.

02:12.535 --> 02:16.080
I saw it driving up though and your assistant told me it was quite wonderful.

02:16.482 --> 02:17.944
So how did you find this place?

02:17.984 --> 02:18.966
How did you come here?

02:19.046 --> 02:22.050
Well, this is a nice story, you know.

02:23.172 --> 02:37.553
The man from which I eventually bought that huge library in 1991, 1992 with botanical and zoological and natural history books and atlases.

02:37.573 --> 02:42.220
He was a customer of mine for many years.

02:42.701 --> 02:45.645
He even was the first man

02:46.283 --> 03:15.615
to respond to my first catalogue you know, I sent this catalogue out and did not know anything about customers because it was the first catalogue and I had never sold any books and I got the addresses and the names of the customers from various sources so I sent I think 600 or 700 copies out or a thousand maybe and the first man to call me

03:16.237 --> 03:45.619
was that very customer who was going to be well essential for my life because he was a very very big collector of not only books but preferably books and after having seen two or three of my catalogs after having bought some books from me he

03:46.004 --> 03:56.273
told me he liked the way I was writing the catalogs, I was presenting the books, and he invited me to his house in Switzerland.

03:56.293 --> 03:57.835
So this is a Swiss gentleman?

03:58.615 --> 04:07.103
Well, he's a Swiss gentleman, but he had made his money in a company in Germany.

04:07.163 --> 04:11.647
So he had lots of companies in Germany, in Switzerland, everywhere.

04:12.708 --> 04:16.011
So most of his time he was in Augsburg.

04:16.784 --> 04:40.851
and when I said well this is very nice but I really I did not think of seeing him because I thought it was only conventional that he invited me and then three times after we met for the first time no we did not meet but after he knew of us from our catalogs he

04:41.573 --> 04:52.824
renewed his invitation and he said, well, you know, I just had my third heart attack and I mean this seriously.

04:52.844 --> 05:07.159
Come and see me in the Wallis, in Sion, in Switzerland, and you can make a stay at my house near Schaffhausen, in which I do not

05:08.236 --> 05:36.994
live any longer but which is quite nice and there are guardians there they will they will see you through okay so in 1980 in April 1980 I of course keep that date in my mind as you may as you may surmise Helga and I we drove to Sion

05:37.514 --> 05:41.739
in the valleys, and we made a break here in the Biber Millet.

05:41.779 --> 05:45.763
And when we entered here, I said to my wife, well, look at that.

05:47.445 --> 05:50.729
I think this is, this should be our home.

05:51.230 --> 05:54.974
And she said, well, now, now you're getting crazy.

05:56.796 --> 06:06.627
Because we just had rebuilt a nice house in Bavaria and had bought an old schoolhouse for our business and so on.

06:07.366 --> 06:19.603
And I had just reconstructed that schoolhouse, and... Well, we just began to be seriously settled there.

06:19.623 --> 06:23.308
And then I said to Helga, let's try to get here.

06:23.809 --> 06:29.897
And she said, no, this is impossible, and you're really dreaming, and I think you...

06:30.434 --> 06:36.084
If you don't give up that, you get silly.

06:36.926 --> 06:38.488
But I kept that in mind.

06:38.949 --> 06:51.852
And indeed, this man wanted someone to preserve this estate, the house and the collections.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.980
the art collection, the antiquities collection.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.742
He wanted to pass it on, was it?

06:55.762 --> 06:56.784
He wanted, yeah.

06:56.864 --> 07:00.589
I mean, to pass it on to somebody who would respect it and take care of it, I guess.

07:00.690 --> 07:01.291
Yes, yes.

07:01.711 --> 07:04.215
He wanted someone to follow him.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.762
In 1980, he was already 74 or so.

07:09.703 --> 07:18.396
So he made his plans to settle everything.

07:18.730 --> 07:45.345
and so we kept in, we kept contact with each other and in 1983 he invited me to buy half of the Vibermühle by giving him one half of my Bavarian company which then sounded quite well to me but I gave him one half of my

07:45.713 --> 08:12.615
Bavarian company and then I realized that the Swiss were not at all willing to even let me buy or have one square meter of those 80,000 square meters of that estate let alone the house and so on they just laughed at us when we came and told them we wanted to have 50% but then

08:13.591 --> 08:41.083
and I think you will see Adrian Flüemann so he was instrumental in that whole deal because he was also a customer of mine and he was Swiss so I begged I asked Flüemann to step in on my behalf and he then bought the whole of the Bibermühle from

08:41.671 --> 09:10.058
the man from my customer, Mr. Bösch, and immediately I hired from him one half of the Bibermühle and we started our business there, but so to say not in a house that belonged to me.

09:10.662 --> 09:19.495
So I stayed in Bavaria and only came to the Bibermühle once in two months or so, or once in three months.

09:20.837 --> 09:24.142
But nevertheless, business was good.

09:24.903 --> 09:32.314
Business evolved and I got pretty much known in those fields.

09:32.915 --> 09:38.323
And then I discovered medieval manuscripts and

09:39.400 --> 09:42.183
made a name in that field.

09:42.864 --> 09:50.132
I published those catalogues, Leuchtenes Mittelalter catalogues, the like of which has never been published before.

09:51.874 --> 10:05.610
And then Mr. Flumann got pretty, pretty difficult problems with his paternal

10:06.147 --> 10:09.332
Heritage, a company near Zurich.

10:10.394 --> 10:18.769
And he had to sell this and he had also to sell the Bibermüll.

10:18.789 --> 10:27.123
And he said to me, and of course, I mean, he was right then, you will never be able to buy the Bibermüll.

10:27.744 --> 10:30.028
But half a year before that,

10:30.413 --> 10:38.164
I just had acquired the whole inventory, you know, of works of art and antiquities and also the library.

10:38.744 --> 10:42.289
And I said, but what should I do with these?

10:43.191 --> 10:52.664
If you sell this, I have to remove it, but I have no house, nothing where to install all these pieces.

10:53.244 --> 10:59.593
And so I made up my mind and I tried once again to get the

10:59.911 --> 11:04.816
permission by the canton authorities to buy the house.

11:04.916 --> 11:08.599
Would it have helped if he would start Swiss citizenship?

11:08.619 --> 11:14.425
Of course, I mean, this was the leaping point, so to say.

11:14.725 --> 11:18.349
I mean, he could acquire everything being a Swiss.

11:18.409 --> 11:19.830
But I mean, couldn't you ever become a Swiss?

11:19.950 --> 11:21.852
No, this is very difficult.

11:21.892 --> 11:23.634
You know, it takes 10 years or so.

11:23.654 --> 11:24.375
It takes 10 years.

11:24.675 --> 11:29.800
And I did not want to do that because I'm German and I want to stay German.

11:30.623 --> 11:35.308
about my children, this is another quite different affair.

11:35.368 --> 11:38.331
They may become Swiss, but I am not.

11:39.131 --> 11:59.972
So I invited all the authorities from the Gemeinde Ramsen, from the Kantons Schaffhausen and from Bern and I made a small exhibition and I held a speech which way I could think to use to really

12:00.340 --> 12:29.571
used the Bibermühle in a in a senseful way and so on and so on and believe it or not all of them and all the the ones that really were the ones in charge came to me after after my speech and after my after our conversation and the Bibermühle and said well

12:29.787 --> 12:42.046
We will do everything that you can acquire this, notwithstanding our legal conditions.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.307
Notwithstanding.

12:43.928 --> 12:56.267
And they said, if this is the last thing we do in our official career, but we will see that you

12:56.973 --> 13:17.682
that you can buy the house and the estate and of course I was and they said well you are world famous we want that your cultural shine falls on the canton shop this this was uttered this way I do not I do not

13:23.635 --> 13:29.969
When I see your ads in the Book Collector, you still do cite both Germany and here.

13:30.350 --> 13:30.851
Yes, yes.

13:31.292 --> 13:42.336
And this is, I still run both of the companies, but of course, you know, as I'm in Bavaria only for three or four days a month,

13:42.923 --> 13:46.088
can't really do business there.

13:46.248 --> 13:48.271
I mean, do you do business there?

13:48.712 --> 13:55.923
Well, in a certain way, but now, of course, 80% or 85% are done via Switzerland.

13:56.444 --> 14:10.045
Now, when somebody expresses an interest in some of these extraordinary books and manuscripts that you just showed me a little while ago, and these are kinds of people that you've been dealing with, nevertheless,

14:10.649 --> 14:13.432
You're talking about really a very serious acquisition.

14:13.653 --> 14:13.873
Yes.

14:14.814 --> 14:16.596
Do they come and look at them?

14:16.616 --> 14:17.037
Yes.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.561
Or do they buy on the strength of the catalog entry?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.924
Well, this depends, Mr. Bassbaines.

14:23.184 --> 14:23.865
It depends.

14:25.207 --> 14:36.221
People who know me, they know that they can trust on everything I write about these books and that they can buy this blind, so to say.

14:36.241 --> 14:38.243
But of course, most of them

14:38.712 --> 14:58.197
just like the occasion, you know, they just like the way of coming to the Bibermühle, getting laid out before them, the books, talking about these things, getting convinced by me, and so on.

14:58.618 --> 15:08.010
Really, they like it, and of course we are talking of serious sums sometimes, six-figure, seven-figure sums,

15:08.564 --> 15:10.566
Seven-figure cents?

15:10.586 --> 15:11.687
Of course, of course.

15:11.707 --> 15:17.914
I mean, I have lots of books that are worth more than a million Swiss francs or a million dollars.

15:19.676 --> 15:37.795
And then, of course, I mean, the relation between a dealer and a good customer, a really good customer, must also be a sort of friendship, you know, because everyone must...

15:38.011 --> 15:41.975
be able to trust the other, also blindly.

15:43.016 --> 15:46.099
You have to trust the other.

15:46.880 --> 15:54.468
The customer must be able to rely on whatever I'm saying about these things.

15:55.709 --> 15:58.872
He must rely on what I'm proving.

15:59.613 --> 16:01.315
And I must rely on what they say.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.337
Some of them say, well, I take it.

16:03.717 --> 16:04.638
Can I take it with me?

16:05.399 --> 16:06.240
And I say, of course.

16:06.780 --> 16:07.461
And he says,

16:07.880 --> 16:11.985
Or she says, because lots of women are interested in it.

16:13.766 --> 16:16.810
He says, can I pay you in three months or so?

16:17.250 --> 16:21.255
Or in six months, if really important sums are involved.

16:21.275 --> 16:23.417
And I say, sure, take it with you.

16:23.898 --> 16:30.165
So we, both parties, have to rely on the other.

16:30.905 --> 16:36.992
And I have, in the 20 years that I'm doing this business now, never been

16:37.546 --> 17:03.503
uh disappointed and you said earlier that you have perhaps you know this this is a business that that serves perhaps 10 20 or 30 customers that's about it well the the most important customers they are never uh more than 20 or 30 the most important of course they are customers and we're talking about the world now so yes in the world

17:03.685 --> 17:13.037
Of course, there are customers who buy one or two books a year from me, and I do not count them in these 20 or 30 customers.

17:13.057 --> 17:19.024
But if he's one or two, buy seven-figure books... Well, then, of course, they belong to that guy.

17:19.425 --> 17:33.102
But really, I mean, if you are in the business like I am, at the very top, you know, at the one-permille top, so to say, not percent, but per-mille top...

17:33.419 --> 17:39.365
you don't have more customers than 20 or 30.

17:39.385 --> 17:40.085
And this is enough.

17:40.406 --> 17:41.707
And it's nice, too.

17:41.767 --> 17:42.628
Of course.

17:42.788 --> 17:44.490
You know every one of them.

17:44.570 --> 17:45.651
There's security in this.

17:46.472 --> 17:52.597
Because you don't have to... Do you acquire things with any of these customers in mind?

17:52.637 --> 17:54.639
This is perfect for so-and-so.

17:54.679 --> 17:55.921
Practically never.

17:56.281 --> 17:57.822
Practically never.

17:57.842 --> 17:58.203
You know?

17:58.363 --> 18:02.667
Because I was always so convinced that I...

18:03.338 --> 18:30.257
would choose the right things the right books and that then the right customer would would come with you know he would be attracted without even knowing of it but he would be attracted that I practically never buy books for certain customers and I'm quite I'm quite aware of

18:30.524 --> 18:33.489
that I'm perhaps the only one who does it like that.

18:33.509 --> 18:39.738
So I never have commissions in public auctions, you know.

18:39.758 --> 18:40.840
Well, I'm sorry.

18:40.860 --> 18:48.652
Whereas most of my fellows in the book trade, they live of commissions.

18:48.672 --> 18:49.814
They live on commissions.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.577
I've told you a cute story.

18:52.398 --> 18:56.965
In my Gentle Madness book, I did an interview with Bill Scheide.

18:57.366 --> 18:58.928
Yeah.

18:59.498 --> 19:08.091
Of course, when he bought the 36-line Bible, he was shocked that he expected to be the underbidder to you.

19:08.311 --> 19:10.355
And you know why I did not buy it?

19:10.695 --> 19:15.202
I've heard stories, and I'm just wondering what the story is there.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.407
I didn't like the book, I have to say.

19:18.887 --> 19:27.801
It's only two-thirds of the 36-line Bible, and one-third of these two-thirds was so heavily...

19:28.270 --> 19:30.132
re-imagined.

19:30.152 --> 19:33.337
It was not a fine book.

19:34.318 --> 19:36.901
I'm really sorry, but it was not a fine book.

19:37.242 --> 19:38.083
But an important book.

19:38.223 --> 19:52.742
A hugely, immensely important book, but this is perhaps one of my faults, you know, if it is not appealing to me.

19:53.465 --> 19:59.714
It is very, very rare that I buy even the most immensely important book in the world.

20:00.195 --> 20:07.246
If it doesn't appeal to me, it must have a certain appealing quality.

20:07.787 --> 20:09.990
A texture, a resonance.

20:10.010 --> 20:10.651
Yeah, yeah.

20:10.671 --> 20:12.374
It has to speak to you almost.

20:12.394 --> 20:13.976
Yeah, yeah.

20:14.317 --> 20:18.283
It must also be visibly appealing to me.

20:18.303 --> 20:21.868
So, and this was not, I mean, this was...

20:22.102 --> 20:30.937
I knew, of course, that I would never be able to buy a 36-line Bible in my life.

20:31.679 --> 20:35.826
But really, I mean, I'm still searching for a Gutenberg Bible.

20:35.846 --> 20:39.973
So this is even more important than a 36-line Bible.

20:39.993 --> 20:44.160
And I'm quite confident that sometime I will...

20:44.562 --> 20:46.304
I will be able to get one.

20:46.324 --> 20:48.987
Well, there are only two privately owned... I know, I know.

20:49.007 --> 20:50.728
I know very well.

20:51.269 --> 20:58.777
And really there's only one, I mean, because the shitey one is not going to... Yeah, shitey is to Princeton now, of course.

20:58.817 --> 21:00.939
They say we don't know, but they know.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.401
Of course, of course.

21:03.481 --> 21:04.502
It's going to Princeton.

21:04.522 --> 21:09.928
And in a certain way it's a pity, but in the other way it's quite...

21:09.908 --> 21:13.972
Well, they make it impossible for you to inherit things.

21:13.993 --> 21:15.314
Yes, yes.

21:15.694 --> 21:19.959
Imagine with that library, the inheritance tax in that library, it would be impossible.

21:20.059 --> 21:22.061
Yeah, of course.

21:22.081 --> 21:33.494
So, of course, his hares would be forced to sell the library, which I would not regret, of course.

21:33.514 --> 21:36.157
So we are here.

21:36.177 --> 21:38.059
So this is the...

21:38.765 --> 21:50.437
Schloss Herblingen Chateau, the old... Well, I'll show you.

21:50.457 --> 21:51.918
Just a little reflection here.

21:52.258 --> 22:03.810
Did you ever think, when you started in the business of being a bookseller, did you ever believe that you would achieve this level of...

22:04.567 --> 22:07.451
Yes, I always wanted that, yes.

22:07.571 --> 22:10.716
I have to say, I always thought that I could get there.

22:11.757 --> 22:16.144
And I think you have to be very, what we call, ehrgeizig.

22:17.606 --> 22:30.945
The English word will come to me, but what we call ehrgeizig, it is E-H-R-G-E-I-Z-I-G, ehrgeizig, etc.

22:31.735 --> 22:59.228
but it will come to me so you have to be that to run all those risks and to take all these well difficulties and so I always want to get at the top whatever you did whatever yes of course one has to have this

22:59.815 --> 23:29.788
this drive in your brain in your blood and the confidence and so perhaps I was the only man on earth to whom it didn't come as a surprise that we in the end succeeded in a certain way family and of course my dear fellow colleagues they

23:29.920 --> 23:36.448
They were bad-mouthing, as the Americans say.

23:37.829 --> 23:39.671
There's usually a reason for that.

23:39.772 --> 23:41.233
Yeah, yeah.

23:41.253 --> 23:45.398
I mean, you know, if nobody likes to follow behind.

23:45.438 --> 23:46.580
Of course not.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.280
Of course not.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.602
You're always going to find him.

23:48.622 --> 23:52.506
But I... A lot of people hate Pierre.

23:52.587 --> 23:53.227
I worked hard.

23:53.247 --> 23:54.208
Yeah, of course.

23:54.229 --> 23:55.430
He's a good friend of mine.

23:55.790 --> 23:57.372
I interviewed him in Paris.

23:57.452 --> 23:59.775
He's a good friend of mine, and I like him very much.

24:00.042 --> 24:02.147
He's a grand old man.

24:02.428 --> 24:03.791
He'll be in this transaction.

24:04.032 --> 24:11.971
I'm going to see Niko Israel and Carlo Chiesa.

24:12.212 --> 24:12.913
Oh, yeah.

24:12.994 --> 24:16.482
Well, these three, I mean, they... So this is...

24:16.630 --> 24:18.973
I'm shooting for the very best.

24:19.093 --> 24:20.075
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:20.095 --> 24:22.258
And everyone brings a different perspective.

24:22.278 --> 24:23.880
Yeah, of course, of course.

24:23.900 --> 24:24.821
And you're the young guy.

24:25.202 --> 24:34.575
Nico Israel, unfortunately, stopped selling and dealing, but, I mean, he's the elder statesman.

24:34.655 --> 24:35.897
Of course.

24:35.937 --> 24:39.682
He can talk about the war, too, which is very interesting.

24:40.363 --> 24:46.131
And that spanned the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, you know, in which he was one of the driving forces.

24:46.718 --> 24:56.809
especially what concerns geography, accesses, travel and so on.

24:57.530 --> 25:10.144
And Chiesa, he was for 30 or 40 years the leading, or he is, but he used to be the leading Italian bookseller.

25:11.440 --> 25:16.808
But he's now stopping and his son takes over.

25:16.848 --> 25:20.213
He said if he's well, he'll be happy.

25:20.233 --> 25:21.294
Yeah, of course.

25:21.595 --> 25:23.057
And Israel said the same thing.

25:23.077 --> 25:24.138
He just got out of a hospital.

25:24.178 --> 25:27.764
Tell them my regards.

25:27.964 --> 25:35.295
I told them both that you were among the people and they were very pleased.

25:36.436 --> 25:38.199
Well, I'd like to hear that.

25:38.639 --> 25:41.143
Well, now, I mean, all those...

25:41.596 --> 26:09.780
envies and so I mean they they have stopped because they knew that they could not stop me but of course there was a lot of there was a lot of envy a lot of rancune and so I mean really you wouldn't believe your ears sometimes some people recommended that I should write my autobiography now the first or two or three parts

26:10.098 --> 26:12.442
and the next in 20 or in 30 years.

26:12.482 --> 26:19.493
And really, I mean, if I start writing now, it will be two or three worlds like that.

26:20.215 --> 26:23.881
But fortunately enough, I have a lot to do.

26:25.383 --> 26:31.113
Catalogues, selling, and reconstructing our building there.

26:32.254 --> 26:35.700
This will give about 1,200 square meters

26:36.203 --> 26:50.440
space storage rooms, large exhibition rooms, bureaus and so on.

26:50.460 --> 26:55.205
At what point did you realize that you had crossed the threshold?

26:57.468 --> 27:03.595
Well, I mean, one was the reaction from my colleagues.

27:05.337 --> 27:05.658
Thank you.

27:05.678 --> 27:06.058
Thank you.

27:06.646 --> 27:25.407
And the other was that more and more the whole book trade did not believe his eyes and his ears, and I did the very things.

27:27.349 --> 27:30.392
They did not believe what they heard about me, but I did it.

27:30.743 --> 27:34.047
So it was... Can you give me a couple of examples?

27:34.528 --> 27:37.973
What would they hear that they wouldn't believe?

27:38.013 --> 27:50.710
Well, for instance, they did not think that it could be true that I bought the most important Belgian collection of manuscripts, you know, because it was destined to Christie's.

27:51.431 --> 27:52.372
Christie's was there.

27:53.053 --> 27:57.719
And I came afterwards and I just snatched it away from them.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.683
Forty important manuscripts...

28:00.933 --> 28:03.616
So what did you make, a pre-emptive offer kind of a thing?

28:03.756 --> 28:05.138
I just made it, made an offer.

28:05.758 --> 28:12.966
And it was 15 or 20% more than what Christus had offered.

28:12.986 --> 28:13.867
So of course I got it.

28:14.628 --> 28:28.003
And the same year, I snatched away from Sotheby's the collection of the British Royal pension funds that J. Paul Getty, the medieval manuscript of the J. Paul Getty,

28:28.642 --> 28:31.425
had bought from the British Rail pension funds.

28:31.445 --> 28:37.511
And he had promised Sotheby's that they got the manuscripts that he did not keep.

28:38.612 --> 28:41.916
And he kept only 10 manuscripts from the 32.

28:42.677 --> 28:45.880
And I got 22 manuscripts from the British Rail.

28:46.440 --> 28:51.386
I mean, one of the finest collections assembled in the 70s and in the 80s.

28:51.406 --> 28:55.230
So Sotheby's and Christie, they really went furious.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.552
They raged.

28:58.223 --> 29:01.646
Thank you.

29:02.527 --> 29:04.849
This is Alsatia.

29:06.251 --> 29:19.904
After those days you deserve it.

29:19.944 --> 29:23.187
To get only the best.

29:24.489 --> 29:26.931
And, you know,

29:27.670 --> 29:36.559
and one development gives the next, so to say.

29:37.860 --> 29:47.170
I then was prepared to make the finest, the best and also the most luxurious catalogues that exist.

29:47.951 --> 29:49.372
I can prove that.

29:49.973 --> 29:51.554
Why is that important?

29:52.115 --> 29:57.120
This is very important because I think that you can't

29:57.337 --> 30:27.141
that you can't ask say a million dollars for a very fine book from a person without proving that this very book is worth a million dollars or so and to prove this it is vital to convince this very person say

30:27.509 --> 30:31.014
in every aspect.

30:32.035 --> 30:38.424
So, description, scholarly description, collation, whatever.

30:39.625 --> 30:47.736
And so, my manuscript descriptions, they sometimes extend to 200 pages, folio-sized.

30:50.079 --> 30:55.086
There you have that Boccaccio manuscript that is described on 260 pages.

30:55.387 --> 30:59.519
with 88 full-page color illustrations.

31:00.301 --> 31:10.611
And so you give the people to whom you sell these treasures, one has to say, a feeling of confidence.

31:11.249 --> 31:12.671
that everything is alright.

31:12.811 --> 31:15.315
And you're also making a record of that manuscript.

31:15.455 --> 31:15.856
Of course.

31:16.256 --> 31:24.648
And this is the only record of me that I have because I'm not writing the books that I wanted to write but I write those catalogs.

31:24.668 --> 31:28.714
But I mean beyond that manuscripts by definition are unique.

31:29.836 --> 31:35.143
And if they're going into private hands you are giving the world at large a record.

31:35.203 --> 31:36.064
Yes.

31:36.705 --> 31:39.990
And all the libraries especially in the United States

31:40.325 --> 31:42.368
They are really very keen on it.

31:42.388 --> 31:44.811
And by the catalogs, I'm sure, and the catalogs.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.053
As reference to it.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.234
As reference to it, yes.

31:47.835 --> 32:05.439
And especially that series, Leuchtenes Mittelalter, with the six volumes, they contain nearly 300 medieval manuscripts, of which 910 were never known before.

32:05.499 --> 32:08.323
So also the scholarly world never known before.

32:08.759 --> 32:17.972
I mean, they came from private sources, or they were only known by one photograph, black and white photograph, in a Sotheby's catalog in the 40s or so.

32:18.573 --> 32:30.711
So they got known only through my descriptions, or through the descriptions of Eberhard Koenig and I, and through the color photographs that we gave.

32:31.432 --> 32:36.319
And so I made sure that I got the best

32:36.856 --> 32:53.596
authority on these things, because these catalogues are not only sort of magazine of medieval manuscripts or very fine books, but they are also places of scholarly research.

32:55.178 --> 33:00.484
Some of my manuscript catalogues, they contain discoveries

33:00.751 --> 33:08.362
of new, of the names of book illuminators, of whole new schools and so on.

33:08.542 --> 33:11.687
And this is taken over by the scholarly world.

33:12.388 --> 33:15.773
And you hire, you retain the services of experts.

33:16.293 --> 33:17.455
Only one expert.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.997
This is Eberhard Koenig.

33:19.879 --> 33:22.663
So you actually write most of these catalogs yourself too?

33:22.683 --> 33:23.284
Yes, of course.

33:23.304 --> 33:24.225
Of course.

33:25.126 --> 33:29.172
And I do this not only very willingly, but I...

33:29.455 --> 33:59.125
enthusiastically you know and though I'm a very lazy man yeah well I'm a very lazy man but writing these things I just wrote this catalogue on 50 unique printed books which will have 200 folio pages of text and 250 pages of colour for the gospel I wrote it in three weeks amazing so if I have to do

34:00.117 --> 34:00.758
than something.

34:01.499 --> 34:04.283
I do it very quickly.

34:04.343 --> 34:24.913
And of course very seriously and also thoroughly because I really can't afford being trapped on an error.

34:25.093 --> 34:29.179
I mean everyone is subject to faults or errors.

34:29.463 --> 34:34.952
But, you know, in my own field, I really try to avoid any error.

34:34.972 --> 34:35.633
I really try.

34:36.214 --> 34:43.627
And I may say that in my catalogs, 95% are really the truth.

34:44.248 --> 34:48.014
And 5% are perhaps subject to errors or so.

34:48.234 --> 34:49.737
But this is normal.

34:49.977 --> 34:51.720
Subject to challenge, perhaps.

34:52.141 --> 34:55.707
And if I had two years' time instead of

34:55.973 --> 35:02.319
two months or so for preparing and publishing a catalogue like that.

35:02.860 --> 35:21.998
Of course I would try to even avoid those five percent, but being forced, being under the pressure of publishing these catalogues very speedily, it is inevitable to

35:23.075 --> 35:35.694
You know, I do not verify every bibliographical quotation that I take from, say, a source that is very reliable.

35:36.515 --> 35:37.176
Not every.

35:37.216 --> 35:40.200
But most of the time I even verify these.

35:41.562 --> 35:48.212
And you would not believe how often they themselves commit errors.

35:48.232 --> 35:50.095
Oh, I would believe that because I know...

35:50.986 --> 35:55.833
When I was doing my book, I mean, you learn after a while who to trust and who not to trust.

35:55.893 --> 35:56.474
Yeah, of course.

35:56.794 --> 35:57.235
Of course.

35:57.315 --> 35:58.377
I mean, printed sources.

35:58.757 --> 35:58.857
Yeah.

35:58.877 --> 36:00.179
And then, like, Eddie Wolfe.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.481
Not Eddie Wolfe.

36:01.501 --> 36:03.664
Yeah, Wolfe on Rosenbach.

36:03.684 --> 36:05.206
Well, Wolfe made a few mistakes.

36:05.427 --> 36:06.629
Of course he made mistakes.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.112
He made some exaggerations there that went so far.

36:09.132 --> 36:09.232
Yeah.

36:09.733 --> 36:13.118
And then that other fellow, the older one, Eddie Newton, was terrible.

36:13.278 --> 36:13.739
Newton, yeah, yeah.

36:13.839 --> 36:13.939
Yeah.

36:14.088 --> 36:26.907
Now, Newton, he was just, I mean, he pretended to be a poet writing on bibliomania and bibliophilae, but he did not pretend to be a scholar.

36:26.927 --> 36:29.951
No, no.

36:30.532 --> 36:32.515
This, of course, not.

36:35.299 --> 36:40.086
One of the most crucial points, I think.

36:40.727 --> 36:43.791
Yeah.

36:43.872 --> 36:48.440
And booksellers, not only auction houses, but booksellers.

36:49.040 --> 37:05.668
Think of what the United States would be without Rosenbach in the first 20 or 30 years of this century, or without George D. Smith in the first 20 years, without Krauss and so many others.

37:07.070 --> 37:10.656
What would the Italian book market

37:10.872 --> 37:15.718
have been without Leo Olschke, without Tamarote Marinias, without Giuseppe Martini.

37:16.579 --> 37:18.100
By the way, do you read German?

37:19.042 --> 37:26.971
Because I wrote an essay on Ulrico Hoepley and his auction house in Italy, you know, in the first half of this century.

37:26.991 --> 37:28.272
My daughter.

37:28.533 --> 37:29.834
Well, I send you this.

37:31.296 --> 37:32.357
She does my job.

37:34.683 --> 37:35.504
Exactly.

37:35.524 --> 37:40.151
So it really deserves to be pointed out.

37:40.611 --> 37:46.039
When you hear the phrase book culture, what does that say to you?

37:47.301 --> 37:48.602
What do you think of?

37:49.223 --> 37:59.838
Well, I mean, to me, it means much more than literary culture, because it really involves the whole cosmos of the book.

38:00.860 --> 38:01.180
And...

38:01.447 --> 38:31.015
as I had to learn after leaving the university, that knowing literature very well, the literatures very well, you know, I mean, I really knew from Sanskrit to modern Portuguese, I knew most of the languages and most of the literatures, 3,000 years of the literatures, but I did not really very well know the books, so I had to learn three or four or five years, and I'm still learning, of course,

38:31.349 --> 38:40.402
But the basics I had to learn in the first two or three years, and I made a huge number of mistakes, of course.

38:41.063 --> 38:54.403
And then to be able to marry, so to say, these two spheres, the book sphere and the sphere of the literatures,

38:54.704 --> 39:02.617
This is of course a very fortunate thing and not many succeed in this.

39:03.237 --> 39:11.330
But the book culture for me is one of the richest and one of the finest spheres imaginable.

39:12.272 --> 39:21.927
We haven't even discussed the future of the book.

39:23.476 --> 39:40.838
I think it's much more because most of the libraries, they just have that duty to make public the most recent literature to those who are interested in it.

39:40.858 --> 39:51.171
But what I understand under book culture, this is a room or a space of, say, 2,000 years.

39:51.522 --> 40:05.218
It is a room of 2000 years and it is built by rolls and by codices and by printed books and by the most ephemeral things.

40:05.898 --> 40:20.635
So these 2000 years say from the beginning of the Christian era this is what our book culture is made of and will be made of for many hundred years to come.

40:20.902 --> 40:26.627
because these are the two millenniums of the books.

40:27.809 --> 40:31.352
After the year 2000, there will be the computer perhaps.

40:31.652 --> 40:35.516
There will ever be books, of course.

40:37.138 --> 40:50.250
So it is our duty, I think, it is our duty to preserve these 2000 years in our brains, in our libraries, in our

40:50.534 --> 41:03.952
So how many languages would you say you were able to work with?

41:04.012 --> 41:08.418
Well, to work with, it's about 18 or 18 years.

41:08.478 --> 41:12.263
I know old Greek, of course.

41:12.283 --> 41:13.224
Of course Latin.

41:14.186 --> 41:15.127
English a little bit.

41:15.568 --> 41:19.092
No, excellent, thank you.

41:19.132 --> 41:19.613
French.

41:20.285 --> 41:49.228
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and then all the old languages you know so as I told you I studied Old Provençal, Old French, Old Catalan but Old Islandic because I did also Germanic, German languages so it will be about 15 to 20 languages that I can read

41:49.664 --> 41:55.133
And about five to seven where I can speak.

41:55.173 --> 42:00.962
But I think one has to do that, you know.

42:00.982 --> 42:03.466
Only by manuscript that I can read.

42:04.006 --> 42:17.207
So it's really a shame that I can't read those fine shahnamas of the Persian or of the Indian scribes.

42:18.318 --> 42:26.191
Sometimes I buy them without being able to read them because they are, I have so fine miniatures or Koran.

42:26.752 --> 42:31.880
But normally I only buy manuscripts or books that I can read.

42:33.563 --> 42:36.327
So describing them then is...

42:36.627 --> 42:37.909
You're not just selling.

42:38.309 --> 42:39.691
No, no, no, no, no.

42:39.711 --> 42:40.673
You're a beautiful artifact.

42:40.693 --> 42:46.160
Selling is only, say... And you've never really used that word this whole time I've been here.

42:46.181 --> 42:46.761
No, no, no, no, no.

42:46.781 --> 42:48.304
To your great credit, I have.

42:48.324 --> 42:50.747
I'm the only person who's used that word.

42:51.869 --> 42:58.638
Well, to sell a book is in a certain way necessary.

42:58.658 --> 43:04.947
It's not essential to me, but it's necessary to go on.

43:05.467 --> 43:13.478
But to sell the book is only 1% of the works that I do around the book.

43:15.380 --> 43:17.623
I get offered a book.

43:18.624 --> 43:23.431
I see it, I feel it, I browse through it.

43:23.972 --> 43:25.153
I smell it.

43:25.293 --> 43:26.535
I smell it, yes.

43:27.036 --> 43:28.157
I get in touch with it.

43:28.878 --> 43:31.862
And then I buy it, or I don't buy it.

43:32.112 --> 43:33.734
But most of the times I buy it.

43:33.934 --> 43:35.636
It's really a fine book.

43:35.856 --> 43:38.478
And if it is a very fine book, I always buy it.

43:39.459 --> 43:41.481
And policy, that's interesting.

43:41.722 --> 43:42.583
Yeah.

43:42.603 --> 43:46.767
One really has to make his choice before buying.

43:47.287 --> 43:48.428
You don't buy everything, right?

43:48.448 --> 43:49.650
No, no, not at all.

43:49.810 --> 43:52.573
I mean, I used to buy everything in my first years.

43:52.693 --> 43:57.578
And of course, I have 80% of what I bought then still on my shelf.

43:58.378 --> 44:00.921
But now I'm, of course...

44:01.357 --> 44:29.170
very very concerned about preservation state preservation provenance and all these things we have already talked about it and so if it is very fine I always buy it even if I do not know everything about this book and as there are millions and millions of books of course you can't know everything about every book but

44:29.842 --> 44:46.923
This is what my reference library is kept for and in these 25,000 books and 100,000 catalogs you find anything you ever wanted to know and a lot of what you never wanted to know too.

44:47.604 --> 44:58.498
So then I get in touch with the book once again either immediately or preparing a description for a catalog

44:59.086 --> 45:03.833
or for someone who could be interested in this.

45:03.853 --> 45:09.321
And then a second phase begins, a second step to be taken.

45:09.361 --> 45:14.408
And this is the most important one, to really get in touch.

45:14.548 --> 45:22.039
Yes, cheers.

45:22.913 --> 45:25.437
This is one of the finest Burgundy wines in the world.

45:25.577 --> 45:27.600
This is Claude de la Roche on Dijac.

45:30.344 --> 45:36.353
So, I'm an addicted to Burgundy wines.

45:37.275 --> 45:41.982
Thank you.

45:42.042 --> 45:48.291
So, this is the parlay, please.

45:49.052 --> 45:50.254
Sweet.

45:51.230 --> 46:07.006
So this is the most important step, because then you really get in connection with the object.

46:07.827 --> 46:10.429
And this is sort of a love affair, really.

46:10.649 --> 46:14.193
Pia Berenz said almost exactly the same thing.

46:14.293 --> 46:16.275
He used a very crude

46:16.762 --> 46:19.024
Anglo-Saxon women.

46:19.044 --> 46:23.729
And I said, and I said, and my wife was there.

46:23.829 --> 46:28.773
And I said, maybe you want, and I have a tape recorder, and I said, maybe you want to say, make love.

46:29.234 --> 46:32.737
And I said, no, I want to say, what do you mean?

46:32.757 --> 46:34.599
Four letters.

46:34.679 --> 46:37.482
That's what he was saying.

46:37.562 --> 46:42.326
Well, he may say that, you know, being 84 years old, he may say that.

46:42.507 --> 46:43.988
And having two-year-old children.

46:44.288 --> 46:46.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:46.495 --> 46:47.796
I doubt if I'll use that.

46:49.638 --> 46:53.061
My point is I think he was expressing the very same sentence.

46:53.101 --> 46:54.002
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

46:54.142 --> 46:58.626
No, no, no, I mean... This is a physical, emotional... Yes, yes.

46:58.646 --> 47:00.808
It is really... It's very emotional.

47:00.828 --> 47:07.834
You have to fall in love with it before and then you have to develop this falling in love into love.

47:09.055 --> 47:10.317
And I totally agree.

47:10.757 --> 47:14.140
And then, of course, you have to convince...

47:14.677 --> 47:18.723
other people that this is worth your love and their love.

47:20.125 --> 47:22.027
And I succeeded.

47:22.067 --> 47:26.153
And I don't mean to be cool, but do you have to be a salesman too?

47:26.173 --> 47:26.674
Yeah, of course.

47:26.834 --> 47:27.715
And I am.

47:27.896 --> 47:28.697
I think I am.

47:29.137 --> 47:31.320
Because otherwise I wouldn't be here.

47:31.421 --> 47:32.863
We wouldn't be together.

47:32.903 --> 47:40.313
Because otherwise I would still be in my Rottelmünster selling books for 200 Mark and...

47:40.850 --> 48:10.603
being happy to have a turnover of 200,000 DMG a year and in 1992 I made a turnover of nearly 30 million as a one person company which is unheard of in this business of course I think I made the three or four most important deals in the history of book selling I made deals selling to one man

48:10.955 --> 48:19.547
books for the value of 18.5 million Deutsche Mark, which was then 13 million dollars.

48:20.067 --> 48:22.089
at one point, at one time.

48:22.389 --> 48:22.970
To one person?

48:23.230 --> 48:24.031
Yeah, to one person.

48:24.091 --> 48:26.333
Is this somebody you can tell me who he is?

48:26.373 --> 48:29.576
No, no, no, I'm not allowed to do that.

48:29.596 --> 48:32.880
I haven't asked that at all.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.144
Of course, I mean, if it would have been Paul Mellon or so, I would have told you.

48:37.284 --> 48:39.947
Or if the person was deceased, there would be another story.

48:40.247 --> 48:42.529
Yeah.

48:42.549 --> 48:42.830
Okay.

48:43.851 --> 48:45.632
Oh, well, this is good for barley.

48:45.873 --> 48:47.935
I love barley.

48:47.955 --> 48:49.416
Yeah, so do I.

48:49.582 --> 49:03.140
The same meaning.

49:03.221 --> 49:06.044
The sentiment was precisely the same.

49:06.585 --> 49:09.629
What he said is, he said, and he even followed the same thing.

49:09.729 --> 49:14.276
He said, by the time I take my second promenade, his promenade with the book.

49:14.356 --> 49:16.919
He takes a promenade with the book.

49:17.099 --> 49:19.082
And then I do this, I do that.

49:19.400 --> 49:26.468
And then, of course, at his age, like yourself, this is why I'm asking you, he basically writes all of his own catalogs.

49:27.929 --> 49:30.753
And I said to him, and I'll ask you the same question.

49:31.754 --> 49:35.778
I think you may have answered it in various ways, but maybe you can crystallize it.

49:35.798 --> 49:38.802
What's the most satisfying aspect of your business?

49:39.282 --> 49:40.624
This one, of course.

49:41.004 --> 49:41.545
This one.

49:42.025 --> 49:48.192
To be able to transfer your, say...

49:49.353 --> 50:02.812
still unshaped, falling in love with a book into a definable love and then convince someone else to share this love.

50:03.794 --> 50:09.241
I'm sorry, I mean, my English is perhaps 15% of what my German is.

50:09.482 --> 50:12.446
And in German, I could tell it convincingly.

50:13.067 --> 50:17.032
By the way, I'll even say this with a tape recorder.

50:17.052 --> 50:17.453
I'm happy.

50:17.922 --> 50:20.926
My practice is to go over quotes that I use with people.

50:21.827 --> 50:25.172
I'm very happy to share with you the quotations that you give me that I use.

50:25.312 --> 50:34.005
I mean, if you correct them, say, as the English language is concerned.

50:34.045 --> 50:39.272
What I'm saying is I'd be happy to read the things that you say and show you what you...

50:39.522 --> 50:43.548
said, and even give you the opportunity to change things.

50:43.568 --> 50:44.469
Because I want it right.

50:44.930 --> 50:49.036
Being right for me is... I think this is very important.

50:49.216 --> 50:50.498
I think it's very important.

50:50.698 --> 50:56.988
It's no mistake that people are holding vectors on this point.

50:57.288 --> 51:07.403
This world of our books and our world, that this is shown to the many thousands and millions who

51:08.328 --> 51:25.510
would perhaps be interested in these things, but they have never the opportunity to know more about it than say by reading two or three insipid lines of someone who does not know anything about books at all.

51:26.311 --> 51:31.517
And this is really what concerns me most about these things, that most of the journalists

51:31.750 --> 51:41.684
do not know anything, even less than nothing about books, and especially about fine books, about rare books.

51:42.425 --> 51:58.267
And so I'm still agreeing to those journalists as the one that I showed you today who want to write about me.

51:58.348 --> 52:00.070
Well, they're dazzled by the numbers.

52:00.421 --> 52:02.524
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:02.544 --> 52:03.685
Of course, of course.

52:03.885 --> 52:06.288
Now, I'm delighted that you offered me a number.

52:06.348 --> 52:08.391
I hadn't asked you a number yet, but you told me.

52:08.611 --> 52:09.713
I didn't make any 92.

52:09.853 --> 52:11.014
Yeah, yeah.

52:11.034 --> 52:12.136
But, you know, we hear numbers.

52:14.178 --> 52:17.443
They hear numbers, and that's what impresses them.

52:17.463 --> 52:18.304
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:18.324 --> 52:19.565
And it is very impressive.

52:19.585 --> 52:28.116
Yes, but... Because those numbers are in the... When people talk about Kentrick, they say his numbers are art numbers.

52:28.535 --> 52:57.748
and you said that art gallery numbers these are the numbers you expect from someone who's dealing in the fine arts of course no longer only books but books is what really made me and what I'm still in love with it's books but books seen or looked at

52:58.015 --> 53:00.958
as also works of art.

53:01.478 --> 53:22.377
And I think it is very well possible to combine those two worlds, you know, the world of books and the world of the old book as a work of art.

53:22.397 --> 53:25.860
Have you been tempted to go into the fine arts at all?

53:25.880 --> 53:27.381
Never, no, never.

53:28.559 --> 53:29.920
And I tell you why.

53:30.441 --> 53:41.512
Because most of the works of art are only parts of what they used to be at the beginning, you know.

53:42.053 --> 53:54.966
Because I'm always fascinated by the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and my interest is then a little bit dwindling towards the 20th century.

53:55.707 --> 53:57.148
I know that

53:57.837 --> 54:00.359
compared with illuminated manuscripts.

54:00.379 --> 54:25.363
99.9% of all the paintings of the 14th and 15th and 16th century that are still on the market have been restored to a point that one can say that only 20% are original and 80% are over paintings, restorations,

54:25.630 --> 54:28.433
retouches and so on and so on.

54:28.453 --> 54:54.118
So what we see today in most of the works of art of the Middle Ages and of the Renaissance is not what they were but what centuries of restorers and fakers and other honorary people have made of them.

54:55.145 --> 55:22.941
So the only authentic work of art from the Middle Ages that you can still acquire are illuminated manuscripts because they have always been closed, only opened for

55:23.410 --> 55:52.152
smallest fraction of their time of their existence and so all those miniatures made in the 12th and the 13th and the 14th and the 15th century they opened before us as they opened before the very first processor and this is what really fascinates me and the same with books and

55:52.857 --> 56:13.322
One of the most important things about books is, of course, that collecting and also dealing with books is perhaps the only profession in which you can discover a sort of three-dimensional reward.

56:14.083 --> 56:15.345
Three-dimensional.

56:15.365 --> 56:20.211
You can read a book because of its text.

56:20.231 --> 56:22.594
This is one dimension and it's very important.

56:23.131 --> 56:26.375
For a long time it was the only dimension.

56:26.395 --> 56:31.022
Then you can read a book because of its aesthetic qualities.

56:32.063 --> 56:34.586
This is the second dimension.

56:38.151 --> 56:44.640
Imagine an old master drawing or an old master etching yourself.

56:44.660 --> 56:48.165
You have only the aesthetic qualities.

56:48.185 --> 56:50.708
You don't get

56:51.548 --> 57:05.612
philosophical insights, connaissance from an old master etching.

57:05.632 --> 57:16.510
And then you have the third dimension which is combined of its preservation, of its provenance,

57:16.962 --> 57:23.290
and of its, so to say, art-transcending qualities.

57:23.430 --> 57:36.768
And this is the old book, the fine and rare old book, and dealing with it is the only three-dimensional, what we call erkenntnis.

57:37.208 --> 57:39.571
What's that word?

57:39.832 --> 57:41.073
Erkenntnis.

57:41.654 --> 57:44.818
How do you say that?

57:44.838 --> 57:45.619
Erkenntnis.

57:47.000 --> 58:14.779
that you can find in the art world, because there is still the sort of philosophical insight that no other collecting activity can provide.

58:18.640 --> 58:23.545
and it's getting better all the time.

58:23.565 --> 58:29.972
The bouquet is just marvellous.

58:29.992 --> 58:40.783
And so, this is the reason for most of the really great bookmen to die in their bookmen's shoes.

58:41.804 --> 58:42.124
Really!

58:42.725 --> 58:45.728
I mean Krauss, in the last two or three years,

58:46.214 --> 58:48.557
He was just a shadow of himself, of course.

58:48.717 --> 58:55.647
But in his very last year, he still was in the Beaver Mule and bought books from me.

58:55.988 --> 59:05.561
But they carried him in because he was no longer able to take these three or four steps.

59:06.683 --> 59:12.671
They carried him in, he bought books from me, he was delighted and it kept him alive.

59:12.691 --> 59:14.213
It was really like that.

59:14.665 --> 59:42.006
And this is perhaps the most rewarding of all aspects of our business, that we look forward to ages and ages and ages, our 60s, our 70s, our 80s, doing still business, loving the books, selling books to sell, but most important, buying books.

59:43.167 --> 59:50.574
So we are, in a certain way, we are all concealed collectors, of course.

59:51.835 --> 59:59.062
But in my case, I have to say that I'm very different to my French colleagues.

59:59.583 --> 01:00:09.192
The French, they are collectors and they keep most of the best books for themselves.

01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:20.895
and sell only the second range of objects to their clients, but the clients are not dumb, they are not silly, they know exactly what they want to.

01:00:21.816 --> 01:00:36.900
And my decision from the first and second of my life as a bookseller was to sell, to make everything sellable that I have, except for some

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:43.971
collector for some author collections that I cherish.

01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:50.178
It's Horace, Horace and Rabelais and some German.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.007
I also collect some French and English writers.

01:00:58.347 --> 01:01:01.451
I collect William Faulkner and Thomas Pynchon.

01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:02.592
No kidding.

01:01:02.912 --> 01:01:04.474
Not at all.

01:01:04.943 --> 01:01:09.731
And I have the finest collection of Vladino Nabokov in Europe.

01:01:10.872 --> 01:01:21.830
So, I mean, these are the three American writers, I say American though, of course, Nabokov is... Well, Nabokov is basically, he's considered American.

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:28.180
But his finest things you wrote in English, I mean, Lolita and Ada and whatever.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.664
So, I like these three.

01:01:32.332 --> 01:01:35.636
Have you seen Finchens' new book?

01:01:35.736 --> 01:01:36.137
I have it.

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:46.109
I'm a bit disappointed but of course it requires so many historical knowledge.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:48.332
It's a very bold book.

01:01:49.133 --> 01:01:53.498
But it's better than the last.

01:01:53.558 --> 01:01:59.065
Vinland was an embarrassment.

01:02:00.026 --> 01:02:01.528
But of course

01:02:02.048 --> 01:02:05.232
Rainbow.

01:02:05.692 --> 01:02:08.195
Gravity's Rainbow.

01:02:09.357 --> 01:02:11.059
Gravity's Rainbow.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.903
This is, of course, a great 20th century novel.

01:02:14.923 --> 01:02:15.784
Great, great.

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:18.968
One of the 10 greatest novels that I know.

01:02:19.809 --> 01:02:22.913
Three, perhaps, of Gorkner.

01:02:23.253 --> 01:02:25.496
I have a very modest collection of them.

01:02:25.716 --> 01:02:28.039
I mean, for what I...
