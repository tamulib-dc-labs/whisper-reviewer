WEBVTT

00:09.447 --> 00:18.060
Why don't we just do a basic, why don't we do a discussion, and then I can break it up and frame the questions type thing.

00:18.080 --> 00:26.013
And then I'm going to give you a transcript, a text, and you can do anything, I'm putting this on tape, do anything you want with it.

00:27.255 --> 00:35.708
I don't propose to cover ground that we've covered in the past, that's covered, however, feel free to use that, okay?

00:37.730 --> 00:41.434
I'm interested in life after Eleni for Nicholas Gage.

00:43.136 --> 00:47.100
Your life has almost been broken into two.

00:47.520 --> 00:59.252
Not two, but it's really... You're a very successful journalist, highly respected, and yet with the book you've become more than a figure.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.655
Would you subscribe to that?

01:02.535 --> 01:04.758
Not subscribe to it, or would you comment on that?

01:05.799 --> 01:06.960
You've become a national figure.

01:07.818 --> 01:14.746
Well, that has its pluses and its minuses, you know.

01:14.786 --> 01:16.488
Harry, do you agree with that?

01:16.908 --> 01:17.349
Well, I don't know.

01:17.429 --> 01:35.850
I think that I am one of a large number of Greek-Americans who are seen as a representative of the Greek-American contribution to the arts, you know.

01:36.961 --> 01:41.589
So I think that's true.

01:44.974 --> 01:49.341
I'm interested in how the book has changed your life.

01:50.844 --> 01:51.785
Has it changed your life?

01:51.905 --> 01:53.187
Obviously it's changed your life.

01:53.608 --> 02:04.065
Well, the thing about me always has been to

02:07.252 --> 02:12.478
search out the kind of life I want to have.

02:13.979 --> 02:17.083
In other words, what I value.

02:17.103 --> 02:25.011
And then to work, to be able to live that life.

02:25.031 --> 02:29.236
Now, I am a traditionalist.

02:29.977 --> 02:35.723
I like family, friends,

02:36.226 --> 03:04.242
holidays you know my son's an altar boy like i was an altar boy my you know i take my kids to church every sunday we have name days i live within 15 miles of all my relatives not just my sisters but my nephews their wives their children

03:05.234 --> 03:13.803
And I draw strength from that, from being a part of a community.

03:15.805 --> 03:32.743
What I've been able to achieve as a writer has interfered somewhat with that, because I'm away from home alone.

03:34.664 --> 03:55.355
On the other hand, it has made it possible for me, when I am home, to have the time and leisure to enjoy my family.

03:57.419 --> 04:01.525
Let's just make sure we're getting this.

04:02.727 --> 04:03.608
It's a little sunny.

04:04.313 --> 04:05.654
47th Street Camp.

04:05.674 --> 04:06.635
Are you able to go over there?

04:06.655 --> 04:06.915
Yeah.

04:06.935 --> 04:07.656
This place is great.

04:09.478 --> 04:17.946
Okay, I think that answers... I think what you've basically told me is what counts, what has meaning in your life.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.828
So therefore the book hasn't changed your life.

04:20.868 --> 04:21.869
I think that was the question.

04:22.110 --> 04:33.240
Well, to some degree the success of the book has threatened the kind of life that I like to live.

04:34.081 --> 04:39.169
I'm constantly asked to speak outside, you know, all over the United States.

04:39.950 --> 04:47.201
I am offered opportunities to make films and do television interviews.

04:48.503 --> 05:01.422
And all of these things draw your way from your family.

05:02.397 --> 05:11.574
It's not necessarily a blessing to be successful in your work.

05:13.056 --> 05:24.557
Unless you're one of those people who enjoys the accoutrements of success and likes to roll with it, you know.

05:25.634 --> 05:33.024
The more attention you get, the more you go after, the more money you make, the more you spend.

05:33.725 --> 05:37.671
I'm not that kind of a person because I know what gives me satisfaction.

05:38.572 --> 05:47.905
And what gives me satisfaction is the quality of the relationships I have with people.

05:48.906 --> 05:53.953
Outside of those who know you and your family, has the book

05:54.676 --> 05:58.559
brought about a perception of you.

06:01.462 --> 06:05.165
This may give them something of what they want.

06:05.806 --> 06:09.049
I think it depends who the perceiver is.

06:14.754 --> 06:23.181
I think among Greek Americans, judging from all the places I've spoken, I've become

06:25.945 --> 06:50.738
a medium by which the struggle of our parents to take care of us is sort of personified, you know, a lot of in

06:51.562 --> 07:03.413
In Greece, the Communists are very hostile to me because I have exposed the crimes that they committed during the Civil War.

07:07.797 --> 07:18.767
Reasonable people are, I think, responded positively because

07:19.979 --> 07:33.478
For the first time, a book has appeared that gives a realistic portrayal of what happened during the Greek Civil War.

07:33.738 --> 07:44.574
There were thousands of books done by both sides about the Civil War, but each side did it in propagandistic terms, and nobody believed them.

07:44.754 --> 07:48.940
But the reason my book has succeeded is because

07:52.666 --> 07:55.630
And it's credible, yeah.

07:57.452 --> 08:11.931
And also because the book catches light in a Greek village, which does not exist in other books, particularly in English.

08:11.952 --> 08:21.424
And I think the proof of the overwhelming positive

08:21.893 --> 08:30.581
response to it in my book in Greece is the fact that it has sold more copies than any book since World War II.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.243
Do you have any rough figures?

08:33.023 --> 08:37.267
It's about 70,000 copies.

08:37.508 --> 08:39.389
That's a lot of books for the United States.

08:39.850 --> 08:40.871
And that's in hardback.

08:42.412 --> 08:46.236
And has it been published in paperback yet in Greece?

08:46.316 --> 08:50.820
No, it's still selling in hardback.

08:53.045 --> 08:56.450
You know, but not only in Greece, it has sold... How many?

08:56.510 --> 08:57.672
Yeah, that's another question.

08:58.253 --> 09:07.087
It has sold about 4.7 million in 14 languages and is being translated in two more languages.

09:07.107 --> 09:08.269
What are the two others?

09:08.289 --> 09:10.412
Farsi and Chinese.

09:10.432 --> 09:14.658
Farsi is the language... Give me a few, just so we can put it in here.

09:14.979 --> 09:20.908
Well, all the European languages, you know, from Finnish,

09:21.631 --> 09:29.862
to Portuguese, from Swedish to Italian, from all of it.

09:29.882 --> 09:38.955
In England, it won the prize as the best book of 1984, fiction or non-fiction.

09:38.975 --> 09:41.498
I'll probably put this information in the intro.

09:42.219 --> 09:43.842
I mean, this doesn't have to go into it.

09:43.862 --> 09:49.109
No, no, but I'm just talking about the Heinemann Prize, which in competition against... How do you spell that, Nick, the Heinemann Prize?

09:49.449 --> 09:51.452
Yeah, H-E-I-N.

09:52.293 --> 09:53.975
M-A-N.

09:54.395 --> 09:54.976
H-E-I-N.

09:55.396 --> 09:56.217
M-A-N.

09:56.938 --> 10:01.863
Given by the Royal Society of Literature, Great Britain.

10:02.063 --> 10:02.764
Was this in 84?

10:02.784 --> 10:07.830
84, yeah.

10:07.930 --> 10:14.917
This is a group that's made up exclusively of writers, and they choose the one best book of the year.

10:14.977 --> 10:16.579
It's not like here where we give out

10:16.762 --> 10:19.445
Yeah, in different categories.

10:19.465 --> 10:22.408
This is one book.

10:24.610 --> 10:33.479
In England, I mean in Germany, it was serialized, the whole book in Stern, the largest magazine.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.823
There was an hour television documentary.

10:37.643 --> 10:42.128
A whole team went to Greece and followed my steps to see if

10:42.648 --> 10:46.053
what I had done was accurate.

10:46.434 --> 10:47.636
To try and document it.

10:48.096 --> 10:55.748
And they did, even though the guy started out wanting to prove me wrong.

10:55.889 --> 11:00.015
You had mentioned in one of the previous interviews we've done that

11:06.273 --> 11:08.835
single suit filed against you, is that correct?

11:08.855 --> 11:09.276
No, yeah.

11:09.296 --> 11:11.518
And it's too late now because of the statute of limitations.

11:11.538 --> 11:18.565
But I mean, assuming that you libeled anyone... Well, I call people murderers, torturers by name.

11:18.685 --> 11:27.113
You know, I list the incidents, the people they tortured, and the places where the acts were taken, I mean, were carried out.

11:27.593 --> 11:34.440
And no one has

11:35.264 --> 11:49.363
has sued me, even though, you know, there is some sentiment for the left in the Greek government now, you know.

11:50.104 --> 11:57.734
So, I mean, that's another example, you know, of the accuracy of the book.

11:58.856 --> 12:04.343
Well, you invited, you invited... Yeah, I gave interviews in Greece, you know.

12:04.475 --> 12:16.189
I gave an interview in Greece where I said I would go on Greek television with anyone in Greece, any one single person in Greece, to debate the accuracy of my book.

12:20.614 --> 12:27.102
But I insisted that it be live so that it wasn't edited and slanted.

12:27.663 --> 12:32.068
And I insisted that it would be a one-to-one situation.

12:32.622 --> 12:35.888
Greek television has not responded to my offer.

12:35.908 --> 12:50.555
And nor has any... Well, people have said that, you know, I will do it, you know, but they say that knowing that, you know, that Greek television won't do it.

12:51.056 --> 12:55.204
Are there any substantive criticisms of the

12:57.277 --> 13:01.121
Or are they just saying that it's a stilted view?

13:01.141 --> 13:03.143
Are they saying anything substantively?

13:03.163 --> 13:18.880
Well, one thing that they say is that the book is one-sided, that it presents only the crimes of the communists.

13:18.900 --> 13:26.288
And my answer to that is, first of all, that it's not true.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.392
If anyone who reads the book carefully will know that.

13:29.853 --> 13:37.922
Second, I reported the events that happened in my region during that period.

13:38.863 --> 13:51.116
And if anyone can prove that those events did not take place, or that I left out events that did take place, then they have a point.

13:51.216 --> 13:55.701
But no one has done that.

13:56.525 --> 14:02.757
I think we should leave that to later because... Well, we're going to move this stuff around, I think.

14:02.877 --> 14:07.767
But another thing is, there was this book called The Other Lenin by a guy named Basilica Batas.

14:08.608 --> 14:17.706
This fellow is a journalist who is essentially, I don't even think he's a communist, he's just an opportunist.

14:17.804 --> 14:19.666
Why don't we just do that question right now?

14:19.846 --> 14:20.987
That way we can get it away.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.769
Well, I don't know, you didn't have that checked.

14:23.310 --> 14:25.672
Did you want to respond to that?

14:25.792 --> 14:26.313
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:26.333 --> 14:26.713
It's right there.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.036
Yeah, but you didn't check it.

14:29.216 --> 14:29.837
Yeah, it's okay.

14:29.977 --> 14:30.457
I'll respond.

14:30.477 --> 14:31.779
Well, why don't we just respond to it?

14:31.819 --> 14:35.142
Why don't you just respond to it and I'll frame a question to it later.

14:35.162 --> 14:41.188
Well, he published a book called The Other Lenny, as I say.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.850
And when was this published?

14:43.671 --> 14:47.575
This was published about last year.

14:48.517 --> 14:51.040
Can I ask you a couple questions?

14:52.381 --> 14:59.649
Is it one of these titles that refers to your book or is he actually talking about another woman?

15:00.289 --> 15:01.090
Well, it's both.

15:01.350 --> 15:14.604
I mean, he talks about, he refutes my book and then mentions another woman who was killed by writers in another part of Greece.

15:14.684 --> 15:17.207
Are there purportedly similar circumstances?

15:17.744 --> 15:19.205
Theoretically.

15:21.167 --> 15:24.310
But the main thrust of the book is to try to undermine my book.

15:25.071 --> 15:35.622
The thing about this book is that this guy, as I say, is just a political opportunist.

15:36.523 --> 15:43.309
But an opportunist, he saw that my book was selling tremendously well and he thought he'd get the other side to buy his book.

15:45.271 --> 15:47.093
The previous book that this guy did

15:47.410 --> 15:51.656
was called, was about transvestites.

15:52.096 --> 15:54.760
And the title of it was, I Love Your Dressed George.

15:55.581 --> 15:56.362
I Love Your Dressed.

15:56.442 --> 15:57.724
I Love Your Dressed George.

15:59.486 --> 16:01.469
I had run into this guy.

16:01.529 --> 16:03.512
He interviewed me about seven or eight years ago.

16:05.574 --> 16:05.855
Okay.

16:06.075 --> 16:08.458
And I have the article.

16:08.478 --> 16:17.350
He said to me, he interviewed me as being a leading investigative reporter in the United States, and he said...

16:18.680 --> 16:23.567
to me, do you have sources in the mafia?

16:23.607 --> 16:24.248
I said, yes.

16:24.508 --> 16:26.371
He said, do you have sources in the FBI?

16:26.471 --> 16:29.796
I said, yes.

16:30.537 --> 16:32.099
I said, do you have sources in the CIA?

16:32.159 --> 16:38.328
I said, no, the New York Times has another reporter, Seymour Hersh in Washington, who handles the CIA.

16:39.469 --> 16:45.818
So he wrote that accurately, but then the headline he wrote said, I have sources

16:46.085 --> 16:48.589
in the mafia and the CIA.

16:49.150 --> 16:59.205
I mean that's just the kind of blatant twisted journalism that goes on in Greece.

16:59.625 --> 17:11.603
But then in this book he said, in the front of the book he says that he spent six months researching the book in

17:11.920 --> 17:18.027
In an article he wrote to a Greek magazine, Anna, he says he spent two years researching the book.

17:18.988 --> 17:34.205
In fact, according to the people in Lla, he went to Lla one afternoon, and that was the total of research that he did in Lla, and the book is riddled with errors about the village and the location of houses and the people.

17:36.488 --> 17:41.033
Then he quotes the worst thing he says in it, which is...

17:41.688 --> 17:42.870
abysmal.

17:43.330 --> 17:56.588
He quotes a former guerrilla named Demetrius Gasteiz, who was a judge for the guerrillas.

17:56.688 --> 18:11.307
And he quotes this guerrilla saying that he saw information that my mother was a spy, that she was giving information to the nationalist troops.

18:12.468 --> 18:17.153
First of all, this fellow Gasteese was never in our region.

18:17.553 --> 18:18.554
He was on Gramos.

18:18.694 --> 18:23.679
He never came to the Murgana Mountains, where my village is.

18:23.699 --> 18:25.721
Second, this fellow is a butcher.

18:26.321 --> 18:37.753
He was the judge that sentenced to death probably the best officer in the guerrilla forces, a man named Yanulis.

18:37.773 --> 18:40.315
When they lost the battle, they were looking for a scapegoat.

18:40.953 --> 18:49.081
And this is an infamous crime within the communist ranks.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.004
And this is the man that sentenced this guy to death.

18:52.244 --> 18:53.245
How do you spell your new list?

18:55.307 --> 18:57.429
Y-I-A-N-O-U-L-I-S.

18:57.789 --> 18:59.310
It's mentioned in my book.

18:59.971 --> 19:09.340
And this is the guy, and he prints this, this slander, with no...

19:10.130 --> 19:13.013
corroboration, no factual information.

19:13.473 --> 19:24.785
And if anyone who was in the village at that time would know that it would have been impossible for anyone to give information to the nationalist troops.

19:26.026 --> 19:33.494
Because the whole region was mine and it was heavily guarded, so to go in and out was impossible.

19:33.874 --> 19:37.538
And if my mother was able to go in and out, she wouldn't have

19:37.855 --> 19:39.356
she wouldn't have stayed behind.

19:39.396 --> 19:41.438
She would have escaped after we escaped.

19:41.458 --> 19:44.741
You know, it's just a bold-faced lie.

19:44.841 --> 19:48.704
Well, it's an incredible... Yeah, but that's what they do.

19:48.804 --> 19:55.009
They have these, you know, the big lie is the way you attack somebody.

19:55.029 --> 19:55.230
Hi.

19:55.250 --> 19:55.710
Hi, Jake.

19:55.730 --> 19:56.250
How are you doing, Joel?

19:56.270 --> 19:56.371
Good.

19:56.551 --> 19:56.971
How are you doing?

19:57.011 --> 19:57.532
Very well.

19:57.552 --> 20:02.596
How did your... Sorry.

20:02.916 --> 20:07.660
But the proof of the total...

20:09.277 --> 20:17.026
bankruptcy of this book is the fact that it is disowned even by the comments.

20:17.086 --> 20:18.968
This is the other Eleni.

20:18.988 --> 20:19.649
The other Eleni.

20:19.709 --> 20:20.971
Nobody bought it.

20:20.991 --> 20:22.072
It's dead in Greece.

20:22.132 --> 20:22.893
Did it sell at all?

20:23.574 --> 20:29.240
You know, the last time I was there it had not sold more than 2,000 copies.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.143
So why does this guy bring it up, I wonder?

20:31.183 --> 20:33.225
Well, because that's the way

20:33.678 --> 20:36.381
they have of attacking you.

20:36.481 --> 20:39.784
So it's there and you have to respond.

20:39.844 --> 20:44.489
And then you have to go into this long story about what... Well, I don't think we have to, do we?

20:45.150 --> 20:46.291
Well, you know, I don't care.

20:46.791 --> 20:47.312
Well, we'll see.

20:47.332 --> 21:00.506
I don't mind saying it because I'd like to get that stuff about how incredible this book is.

21:00.566 --> 21:00.786
Okay.

21:00.806 --> 21:01.947
Your book has been read

21:03.260 --> 21:09.406
You'd say widely on both sides of the political spectrum.

21:09.426 --> 21:20.116
The interesting thing is that there have been several articles in Greece by communists praising my book and saying, it's about time we admitted what we did.

21:20.136 --> 21:21.737
And I can show you the articles.

21:22.638 --> 21:30.786
There was one in which the guy said, because one of the things they do is to attack me as a CIA agent.

21:31.053 --> 21:39.825
And finally, one leftist wrote in the Greek newspaper, does a man have to be a CIA agent to remember his mother?

21:41.808 --> 21:54.065
But, you know, hardcore communists have come to my defense because, you know, they understand that what I wrote is the truth.

21:55.808 --> 22:00.334
One of their questions, and I think it's one of the

22:00.736 --> 22:03.741
two or three fair ones that they have, very interesting ones.

22:04.422 --> 22:07.327
What has been the impact of the book in Leah?

22:07.407 --> 22:10.132
Obviously in Greece, because we've already discussed that.

22:10.452 --> 22:11.194
How about The Village?

22:11.634 --> 22:21.912
Well, those Communists are upset about it, and those who suffer from the Communists are very pleased about it.

22:21.932 --> 22:25.157
I mean, on politics.

22:25.525 --> 22:32.411
The impact is that several thousand people from all over Europe and the United States have gone to Lear, which is a very remote place.

22:32.752 --> 22:37.636
A number of them stayed over, slept outside on the ground.

22:39.037 --> 22:44.742
They go with a book page by page to look at all the scenes.

22:45.403 --> 22:46.284
It's amazing.

22:46.664 --> 22:49.707
Has it helped the economy of the village?

22:51.428 --> 22:52.169
Yeah.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.351
The unfortunate thing is that

22:54.618 --> 23:01.646
The guy who owned the coffee house is the leftist, you know, and he's the one that benefited most from it, you know.

23:01.666 --> 23:02.707
That is ironic.

23:02.727 --> 23:04.549
Yeah.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.194
I think I asked you this once before.

23:09.754 --> 23:17.042
How did you go about recreating your mother's emotions and her words and those of other characters so many years after the events?

23:17.483 --> 23:22.448
Well, you know, there's a standard journalistic procedure in which you do that, you know.

23:23.828 --> 23:30.316
I interviewed everyone who was still alive who was in the village at the time.

23:30.937 --> 23:44.433
I went all over Western Europe, I went to Eastern Europe, to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and I tracked everyone down.

23:44.573 --> 23:52.182
I spent over $100,000 on research to find these people.

23:52.735 --> 23:56.560
I would ask them about particular incidents.

23:56.580 --> 24:11.359
And whenever two people in two different places who have not, at least two people, in different places who have had not contact with each other, told me the same incident, then I knew that that incident... You were interoperating.

24:11.379 --> 24:12.120
Yeah, it took place.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.782
It's cross-checking, it's called.

24:13.802 --> 24:15.925
I think what you're saying is you used

24:16.445 --> 24:18.628
standard journalistic techniques.

24:18.668 --> 24:19.629
Which are irrefutable.

24:20.010 --> 24:23.855
Which are standards of evidence in any court.

24:23.895 --> 24:41.859
And in terms of the emotions of my mother, after we left the village, I talked to a number of village women who talked to my mother during this period, and she would tell them things.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.203
And when she would tell them

24:45.892 --> 24:48.435
something about what she was feeling, she told them.

24:49.016 --> 24:58.247
I just simply described it as her ongoing emotion rather than naming the person she told and so forth, which slows down the flow of the narrative.

24:58.427 --> 25:01.611
I think I have quotes from you on this that I used in the other story.

25:02.592 --> 25:05.956
And I think you said there was one exception where you went out to where she was.

25:05.976 --> 25:06.576
Yeah, the last.

25:06.957 --> 25:08.619
And you just put yourself in her place.

25:08.919 --> 25:10.341
And that was the only place.

25:10.361 --> 25:11.743
And that's all in the back of my book.

25:11.823 --> 25:15.527
I mean, it's all, it's written in a

25:16.402 --> 25:23.049
In the back of my book, I describe what methods are used.

25:24.050 --> 25:27.114
They want to know if your view of the Civil War has changed in any way.

25:28.916 --> 25:32.019
Well, that's a good question.

25:33.561 --> 25:46.155
My view of the Civil War is what it was and what most people, including many communist guerrillas, agree.

25:48.751 --> 26:16.509
is that it was a tragic event that brought untold death and destruction to Greece, that had no chance of succeeding, and that was perpetrated, inflicted on the country by the leadership of the Greek Communist Party.

26:16.529 --> 26:18.572
The commanding chief of the guerrilla

26:18.957 --> 26:24.463
when he returned to Greece, said the Civil War was a mistake.

26:26.205 --> 26:35.556
At about this same period, the three communists took to the mountains.

26:40.982 --> 26:48.711
The Italian communists were also undergoing a similar kind of pressure.

26:49.535 --> 26:58.065
And in fact, in Italy, there was an attempt at assassination of the communist leader, Togliari.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.590
As Togliari, they shot him on the street.

27:01.670 --> 27:09.259
As he was falling, he said to his colleagues, no matter what happens to me, don't go to the mountains.

27:09.279 --> 27:14.005
Because he knew that it was futile.

27:14.065 --> 27:17.449
He knew that Stalin and Churchill had divided Europe.

27:18.138 --> 27:26.610
and that there was no chance that certain countries, including Greece and Italy, were going to fall into the Soviet orbit, you know.

27:27.071 --> 27:48.060
But the Greek communist leaders, a stupid, vicious bunch, thought they could inflict losses and persuade Stalin that they could win with something which they never did.

27:48.985 --> 28:01.181
And, I mean, that is the historical view of the war that is standard throughout Europe.

28:01.201 --> 28:17.322
Now, that does not mean that I feel that the Greek Communist Party should never have been legalized in Greece, but I do feel that before being legalized, they should have asked the forgiveness of the Greek people for the

28:17.757 --> 28:20.961
death and destruction they brought up on the country.

28:20.981 --> 28:26.108
Is the attitude in Greece still one of out of sight, out of mind type of thing?

28:26.128 --> 28:28.671
I remember you mentioning before that they just didn't want to talk about it.

28:28.891 --> 28:44.271
No, the communists came back and they began immediately, through their supporters in the Greek media and in Greek cultural fields, to promote their view of the war, that they were the victims, that they were the persecuted,

28:44.656 --> 28:48.420
and that they were the ones that suffered, and to portray themselves as heroes.

28:48.921 --> 29:02.757
Now, along comes my book that shatters all that, that makes it totally uncredible, which is why my book is such a red flag for the fanatic communists.

29:02.778 --> 29:09.526
I mean, as I say, a lot of communists... You better use another metaphor, a red flag.

29:09.546 --> 29:12.249
I mean, it is... But it is, basically.

29:12.309 --> 29:13.330
But the...

29:14.980 --> 29:21.629
But a lot of communists, like I said, I have them inside, I'll show you the articles, you know, have come to the defense of the book.

29:23.010 --> 29:31.301
And, you know, people who have reviewed it all over the world have acknowledged.

29:32.022 --> 29:37.709
When you set out on the project, clearly you had a sense of mission.

29:39.031 --> 29:40.413
I wonder if you could define the mission.

29:40.473 --> 29:43.637
Is it, if in fact you agree there was a mission?

29:44.832 --> 29:50.639
But was it focused to find the people or the person responsible for your mother's death?

29:50.659 --> 30:00.712
Well, when I started out, my main mission was to tell my mother's story.

30:01.993 --> 30:13.067
And through her, in effect, to tell the stories of all innocent civilians who get caught in the middle of these conflicts.

30:14.009 --> 30:15.351
pay the highest price.

30:15.651 --> 30:17.373
And in that sense, it was apolitical.

30:17.613 --> 30:19.936
It was apolitical, you know.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.761
It was a personal obligation, I felt.

30:24.061 --> 30:26.444
I owed my mother, who gave her life to save mine.

30:28.186 --> 30:43.425
Then, as I went on and I found out that some of the people responsible were still alive, I became obsessed with avenging her death, something in the end I could not do.

30:44.536 --> 30:56.694
But a third mission developed, evolved really, as I was doing the research.

30:57.295 --> 31:13.159
I realized that I had gathered the material to portray, describe life in a Greek village in a way that, in a vivid way that had not been done before.

31:13.730 --> 31:14.651
particularly in English.

31:15.653 --> 31:19.077
So, and the critics have noticed this.

31:19.478 --> 31:26.508
You know, the New York Review of Books says that there's enough material here for five dissertations on sociology.

31:26.528 --> 31:27.709
Five different books.

31:27.729 --> 31:27.889
Yeah.

31:27.910 --> 31:34.078
Which leading into another area at some point was probably the principal difficulty of making a film out of this.

31:34.098 --> 31:34.318
Yeah, yeah.

31:34.338 --> 31:35.240
That it was too much.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.324
Yeah, it was too, too, when you had to just take the course to it.

31:38.784 --> 31:43.551
But anyway, I did that also because village life,

31:43.683 --> 32:08.798
In Greece, the life in a Greek village was the same for hundreds of years, centuries, until the mid-1950s, when electrification, roads, and modern technological developments reached the villages, you know, and that changed it completely.

32:09.979 --> 32:12.643
So, here's a world that existed in Greece

32:12.843 --> 32:15.486
and throughout the Balkan for centuries.

32:16.206 --> 32:31.221
And I worked very hard to capture it accurately and vividly and honestly.

32:33.563 --> 32:41.871
It's interesting that people who identified with the book... In Newsweek, about a couple of weeks ago, they asked some famous people

32:42.442 --> 32:44.345
what their favorite book is.

32:44.365 --> 32:47.188
And Zubin Mehta said it was Eleni.

32:47.208 --> 32:47.709
Really?

32:47.729 --> 32:48.871
He identified with the book.

32:48.891 --> 32:49.532
He's an Indian.

32:49.552 --> 32:50.733
Yeah, I have it inside.

32:50.753 --> 32:51.114
Newsweek.

32:51.134 --> 32:52.355
I have Newsweek's at home.

32:52.456 --> 32:53.317
Do you remember which one?

32:53.377 --> 32:54.959
I have it in our shows.

32:57.883 --> 33:01.408
Walter Cronkite says it's his favorite book that he has read.

33:01.808 --> 33:02.970
President Reagan.

33:02.990 --> 33:05.493
President Reagan had you to dinner with your wife.

33:05.994 --> 33:07.576
And he had a special screening of the movie.

33:07.596 --> 33:08.377
Yeah, yeah.

33:08.537 --> 33:10.600
But, I mean, it wasn't political.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.301
You know, he just...

33:12.074 --> 33:15.858
Although certainly some would perceive it to be... Yeah, yeah.

33:15.878 --> 33:23.525
And they're right, but also I have had... I mean, that's almost as much a curse as it is a blessing to hear President Reagan saying he loves your book.

33:23.545 --> 33:36.997
But also, on the other hand, I ran into Margaret Papandreou Nathen, and she said, she said, this was last September, she said, I finally read your book.

33:37.998 --> 33:40.140
It is...

33:41.588 --> 33:47.736
beautifully written, extremely moving, and very important historically.

33:49.639 --> 33:51.781
So, I mean, you have these two.

33:52.462 --> 33:59.251
You won't have Margaret and Reagan and Margaret Papandreou and Greene and Mudge, but they agree on the book.

33:59.331 --> 34:02.515
Well, the point is, it's a Greek story.

34:02.836 --> 34:03.557
Right.

34:03.577 --> 34:11.427
There are elements in there of it being a political story, but it's a human story, which is universal and which transcends political...

34:12.503 --> 34:13.964
ideology, I would say.

34:13.984 --> 34:18.388
I think that's what you're corroborating here.

34:18.829 --> 34:29.318
But another thing, too, you see, Greek prose tends to be overblown.

34:29.438 --> 34:32.861
That is, characters are made to be bigger than life.

34:34.082 --> 34:41.129
Events are given heroic proportions.

34:41.149 --> 34:42.510
And as a result,

34:43.199 --> 34:48.685
you know, the books may be interesting, but they're not believable.

34:48.705 --> 34:54.772
Now, the thing about my book that had such an impact in buries really is that the characters are drawn on a human scale.

34:56.014 --> 35:05.324
The events are described, you know, accurately without exaggeration.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.548
And people would say, I mean,

35:08.782 --> 35:13.526
left, right, center, thousands of people come to me and he said, that's the way it was.

35:13.747 --> 35:15.849
You're answering one of my questions right here.

35:15.869 --> 35:17.510
He said, that's the way it was.

35:17.630 --> 35:19.652
I lived it and that's the way that it was.

35:19.712 --> 35:36.308
You had mentioned one thing, you put a period on that sentence, that you had received thousands of letters from children.

35:37.182 --> 35:40.205
around the world since the book came out.

35:40.645 --> 35:43.588
I'm glad you said that you had crates of letters.

35:44.349 --> 35:45.029
Yeah, I have.

35:45.049 --> 35:47.632
I've received over 6,000 letters from people.

35:47.952 --> 35:48.913
More than 6,000 letters.

35:48.953 --> 35:50.575
More than 6,000 letters.

35:52.296 --> 35:55.299
I mean, this has to be one of the vital signs that a writer has.

35:55.379 --> 35:57.441
I mean, nobody likes to write out into a vacuum.

35:58.702 --> 36:04.708
And when you hear from people on such a scale, perhaps you could tell me, I mean,

36:07.338 --> 36:08.900
All kinds of people.

36:08.960 --> 36:12.625
They're from all over Europe, all over the United States, Australia.

36:13.126 --> 36:28.507
They're from Poles and Nicaraguans and Chileans and Hungarians and Jews and Greeks.

36:29.107 --> 36:31.150
There are many people who have nothing.

36:32.933 --> 36:36.197
There are a lot of letters from Greeks whose parents

36:36.683 --> 36:44.731
emigrated here, and because of the cultural clash, their relationship with their parents, one or more of their parents, was strained.

36:44.871 --> 36:55.842
And they say to me, they say, I finally understood my mother, or I finally understood my father, and I'm talking to my father after 10 years because I know what he's been through, you know.

36:56.583 --> 37:06.673
And I've had thousands of letters, some very eloquent letters, some from children who had been taken into communist countries, you know.

37:07.801 --> 37:11.365
This is an interesting question they have.

37:11.385 --> 37:18.614
What do you think of Andreas Papadreiro's attempt to end the Civil War by granting amnesties, pensions, and right of return to all?

37:19.235 --> 37:22.539
I didn't know that he had done that, but it's an interesting question.

37:22.559 --> 37:37.437
Well, I think that at some point this part of Greek history has to be put in the past, but I think it has to be done honestly and not one-sidedly.

37:38.193 --> 37:55.737
I mean, in September I was in Greece, and the government had just brought to Greece several hundred communists from Eastern Europe and given them free vacations in Greece.

37:56.979 --> 37:59.042
Now, these are people who betrayed their country.

38:00.664 --> 38:07.373
And, okay, you forgive them, forget what they did, but to reward them, I think, is a travesty.

38:07.741 --> 38:18.014
How many Greek-Americans have been brought to Greece and given free vacations in Greece by any Greek government?

38:18.634 --> 38:30.009
And I ask that question in view of all the Greek-Americans have done for Greece, for their native country.

38:31.070 --> 38:36.837
And so some of those things, some of those excesses,

38:38.150 --> 38:39.271
are distasteful to me.

38:39.992 --> 38:54.128
But the policy of trying to bind the wounds of Greeks, you know, I support.

38:55.690 --> 39:00.816
But the problem is that the great hostility comes from the communists.

39:00.836 --> 39:05.541
It does not come from the right, you know.

39:05.858 --> 39:10.783
We've had numerous assassinations in Greece since 1974.

39:10.983 --> 39:15.047
At least 10 assassinations.

39:16.028 --> 39:18.791
All of them were political assassinations.

39:19.031 --> 39:26.519
All of them were leftists killing Americans or Greek conservatives or writers.

39:26.539 --> 39:34.347
So there hasn't been any assassination in the other direction, which is, I think, proof of what the climate

39:34.917 --> 39:36.498
in Greece is not, you know.

39:36.739 --> 39:49.030
These communists have come back and they feel, what we didn't win in the war, we are winning, we have won through our, we're going to win through our propaganda, you know.

39:49.790 --> 40:00.540
And my book has frustrated that campaign and that's why they are so upset with me.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.743
Let's just do a test here.

40:04.550 --> 40:08.854
A question here is, the communist versions of pedomasoma, is that how it is?

40:08.874 --> 40:09.174
Pedomasoma.

40:09.194 --> 40:10.175
Pedomasoma.

40:10.375 --> 40:23.987
They were trying to get children out of the war zone, where bombs and napalm were being used, and to keep leftist orphans from being arrested, as many were after the war, they claim.

40:24.007 --> 40:29.712
Do you think there is any justification to this argument, even if the argument does not apply to what took place in Leah?

40:30.192 --> 40:32.214
This is their question.

40:32.234 --> 40:34.236
I think this is absolutely...

40:35.802 --> 40:46.756
It's another one of the great lies that the communists promote.

40:49.019 --> 41:03.818
The practice of taking children and taking them to communist countries to educate them and provide future cadres is part of communist

41:04.574 --> 41:08.720
of the tactics of communist movement.

41:09.060 --> 41:14.007
During the Spanish Civil War, thousands of Spanish children were taken to Russia.

41:14.608 --> 41:17.953
Most of them did not return until 20 years later.

41:17.973 --> 41:26.144
And a few of them, when they did return, were found to have been KGB agents.

41:27.887 --> 41:33.855
Last week, recently, there was a front page in the article

41:34.493 --> 41:50.271
in the Washington Post, oddly a conservative newspaper, which detailed that the Russians are taking thousands of children from Afghanistan to be educated and to provide future cadres in Afghanistan.

41:50.351 --> 41:51.933
This is in January?

41:52.814 --> 41:54.736
This will be coming out in March sometime.

41:54.756 --> 41:56.618
This was in January, yes.

41:56.778 --> 41:58.140
Okay.

41:59.141 --> 42:04.247
And I think that they have, you know,

42:04.683 --> 42:08.428
They're taking something like 6,000 children.

42:08.488 --> 42:17.761
They've taken an average of about 6,000 children a year, which means over 30,000 so far.

42:18.021 --> 42:19.002
In Greece they took 28,000.

42:19.443 --> 42:34.183
So this is standard communist practice, you know, that's written about, that's in communist literature.

42:34.518 --> 42:37.902
And that has happened in numerous other countries.

42:38.483 --> 42:44.250
So to say that in Greece it was done to protect the children is a damn lie.

42:44.470 --> 42:47.334
So they don't deny, certainly, that they did it, obviously.

42:47.474 --> 42:47.614
No.

42:47.674 --> 42:50.999
By putting forward this kind of an argument is to justify it.

42:51.219 --> 42:54.363
But this has nothing to do with the reason they did it, and they said so, you know.

42:54.383 --> 42:56.205
We will educate these children to be...

42:56.540 --> 42:57.721
future communist leaders.

42:58.703 --> 42:59.884
That's what they wanted to do.

42:59.904 --> 43:02.287
And to keep leftist orphans from being arrested?

43:02.347 --> 43:04.230
Were leftist orphans arrested after war?

43:04.250 --> 43:06.973
I don't know any leftist orphans that were arrested.

43:06.993 --> 43:24.235
Orphans after the war or poor Greek youth were offered the choice of going to children's camps where they were fed and clothed and sent to schools.

43:24.569 --> 43:37.662
thousands of those, but there were as many rightists as leftists, the children of as many rightists as leftists, you know, and they chose to go, you know.

43:37.682 --> 43:44.428
Okay, let me just shut this up.

43:44.448 --> 43:45.669
We can frame it as a question.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.132
Where do you stand politically?

43:48.432 --> 43:50.895
Let's get it down to those elements.

43:50.915 --> 43:52.416
Well, since I'm a Greek,

43:53.999 --> 43:58.365
I believe in democracy.

43:59.286 --> 44:06.275
What is it that Greece has given the world in terms of a political heritage?

44:07.577 --> 44:08.257
A democracy.

44:09.739 --> 44:22.656
Any Greek that supports dictatorship, either communist dictatorship or fascist dictatorship, to me is betraying his heritage.

44:28.576 --> 44:36.886
And I opposed the junta when it was in Pasocha as vehemently as I opposed communism.

44:37.868 --> 44:55.950
Those who know my work will know that I've written, I wrote several articles in the New York Times magazine and other places, critical of the junta, that for a period I was not allowed in Greece, for a two-year period,

44:56.369 --> 45:01.595
from 1970 to 1972.

45:02.956 --> 45:11.065
And that I opposed, you know, authoritarianism from the right as I opposed authoritarianism from the left.

45:11.986 --> 45:13.367
But to me there is no difference.

45:13.688 --> 45:16.771
All are equally evil, you know.

45:16.791 --> 45:26.241
What I object to is that there is, in many quarters, the foolish belief that

45:28.921 --> 45:39.272
dictatorship of the left is somehow more benign than dictatorship of the right.

45:39.292 --> 45:42.135
But this is not what I believe.

45:42.476 --> 45:44.838
Stalin killed as many people as Hitler did.

45:44.858 --> 45:46.120
Probably more.

45:46.680 --> 45:54.209
And so those are my political beliefs.

45:54.589 --> 45:58.253
Do you have any feelings that you care to share on your

45:59.178 --> 46:01.300
evaluation of the current government?

46:02.061 --> 46:09.807
No, I think I never commented on Greek politics because I vote in the United States.

46:09.947 --> 46:13.691
I think Greek people should have whatever government they want.

46:14.872 --> 46:18.935
And I know the current prime minister.

46:18.975 --> 46:28.003
I've interviewed him several times as I knew every other prime minister before him since 1974.

46:28.777 --> 46:41.052
So, I don't... And I wrote critical articles of previous governments and I've written critical articles of this government, you know.

46:41.112 --> 46:49.141
And anyone who looks at the... You know, my work as a journalist will know that, you know.

46:49.161 --> 46:56.590
I wrote... In 1917...

46:57.987 --> 47:06.537
1979, a long article about political patriotism, Rusveti as it's called.

47:06.757 --> 47:08.919
The government in Palo then curious.

47:09.059 --> 47:12.523
I've written articles since then and I've gotten this government.

47:12.543 --> 47:21.193
But, I mean, as a reporter, when I see injustice or corruption, I speak and I can demonstrate it, I write about it.

47:26.152 --> 47:35.164
The film tells the core story, which is my mother's struggle to save her children.

47:36.005 --> 47:46.079
And no film can tell in two hours, can tell, can portray what is described in a 500 page book.

47:46.820 --> 47:49.624
So there are limitations in the film.

47:49.644 --> 47:55.872
But the core story is there.

47:56.392 --> 47:59.697
There are things that I would have done differently if I wasn't controlled.

47:59.717 --> 48:03.403
I was one of three producers, but my influence was limited.

48:05.346 --> 48:12.277
But in films you have limited control anyway because it takes about 200 people to make a film.

48:13.338 --> 48:20.289
And a book, you're there alone and you have total control of the product, of what you write.

48:21.090 --> 48:23.614
So what I like to say is that

48:24.100 --> 48:28.947
The book is my creation and the film is the creation of the director, Peter Yates.

48:33.073 --> 48:35.857
But I like films and I'm going to do other films.

48:36.297 --> 48:39.061
I've signed an agreement with Paramount to produce films for them.

48:40.804 --> 48:46.031
But I'm still into writing a book on Greece now that will come out later this year.

48:46.051 --> 48:46.332
Really?

48:47.053 --> 48:47.153
Yeah.

48:47.173 --> 48:47.653
Random House?

48:48.154 --> 48:50.558
Random House here in Collins in England.

48:50.578 --> 48:51.559
Oh, that's exciting.

48:52.298 --> 48:55.141
Do you have a working title on this that you carry out?

48:56.903 --> 48:59.025
I think I'm going to just call it Elas.

48:59.045 --> 48:59.866
H-E-L-L-A-S.

49:00.046 --> 49:01.868
Is it like a travel book?

49:02.008 --> 49:02.989
It's a portrait.

49:03.049 --> 49:06.613
I did a book years ago called A Portrait of Green.

49:06.633 --> 49:07.774
It's a wonderful little book.

49:07.794 --> 49:11.037
Which everybody, it was 15 years ago, everybody liked it.

49:11.858 --> 49:20.787
And everybody's been after me to revise it and reissue it.

49:22.167 --> 49:29.033
The chorus has grown until it has finally included both my American and Irish publishing.

49:30.334 --> 49:42.646
So I resisted for a long time, but then I re-read the book recently, and I saw that it has some very good writing, particularly about the landscape in Greece and about the various aspects of Greek life.

49:43.447 --> 49:51.634
And so I started rewriting and updating, and it's going to mean that I'm going to have to rewrite

49:52.070 --> 50:00.508
50 to 60 percent of the book, but I'm into it and I'm enjoying it, so I'm going to do it, and it'll come out this year.

50:00.869 --> 50:01.470
That's news.

50:02.172 --> 50:03.194
That's book news.

50:03.214 --> 50:04.376
Can I write a piece on that?

50:04.396 --> 50:06.381
Sure.

50:08.104 --> 50:10.770
We've covered the...

50:12.202 --> 50:15.267
I mean, that to me is a central thing.

50:15.287 --> 50:20.295
I mean, you can read it as a political story or you can read it as a... It isn't political.

50:20.315 --> 50:21.657
No, it's a love story.

50:21.717 --> 50:29.790
Essentially, it's a story of the bonds between parents and children.

50:30.692 --> 50:34.979
And particularly the bonds between Greek parents and Greek children.

50:36.481 --> 50:38.344
You can increase that.

50:42.087 --> 50:53.079
If somebody asked me what is this book about, I'd say it's a love story.

50:54.120 --> 51:03.109
And that is, it's the emotional power of the book that has made it successful.

51:03.930 --> 51:11.318
And I'd like to think the way it's written, you know, those two, Americans and Swedes and

51:11.652 --> 51:20.005
and Finns and Portuguese don't care about the Greek Civil War, the politics of left or right.

51:20.065 --> 51:22.108
That's not why they're buying this book.

51:22.128 --> 51:24.431
They're buying it because of the power of the story.

51:24.632 --> 51:24.852
Sure.

51:24.912 --> 51:26.214
Why does Shakespeare endure?

51:26.474 --> 51:30.480
Not because he tells us about what happened at a castle in Denmark.

51:30.661 --> 51:31.182
Yeah.

51:31.202 --> 51:38.032
And when people have attacked me, I said, look, a work stands or falls on its own merits.

51:38.212 --> 51:38.773
My book,

51:39.361 --> 51:45.428
will survive or vanish depending on its quality.

51:45.448 --> 51:47.090
If it's good, it will survive.

51:47.110 --> 51:49.573
And if it isn't, it won't.

51:50.214 --> 51:58.384
But I know that from the response to it all over the world that it is going to survive.

51:58.464 --> 52:08.997
And there's nothing that any son of a bitch can do about it, you know.

52:09.483 --> 52:12.247
Nothing, you know.

52:12.327 --> 52:13.328
Not a damn thing.

52:13.468 --> 52:31.413
That book is going to be there and it's going to be one of the cardinal works about Greece in the English language, whether anybody likes it or not.

52:31.433 --> 52:32.254
That's a wonderful quote.

52:32.375 --> 52:35.659
That's the quote that will end the piece, as a matter of fact.

52:37.833 --> 52:41.136
It's clearly the most meaningful, the most important thing you've ever done.

52:41.576 --> 52:41.676
Yeah.

52:41.696 --> 52:47.302
And may, in fact, when everything is sorted out, will probably be the most important thing.

52:47.662 --> 52:49.964
I don't think that I'm ever going to write anything as good as this.

52:50.564 --> 52:55.449
Because there's no other story that I have felt so passionately about.

52:55.489 --> 53:07.840
And there's nobody that can compete with this book because they do not have

53:08.967 --> 53:12.612
my passion or my skills.

53:13.253 --> 53:25.971
I mean, there are people who have my skills but didn't live through similar events, and there are people who have my passion but are not writers, are not good reporters and writers, you know.

53:26.411 --> 53:38.248
So that formula, literary formula, is hard to repeat, and that's why

53:38.752 --> 53:44.121
The book by Cavathard is such a travesty, you know, because for him it was a way to make a quick buck.
