00:02.883 --> 00:12.835
I've got to get the post on Sunday with you.

00:13.155 --> 00:14.917
WBCNFN.

00:15.097 --> 00:19.282
You know that.

00:19.302 --> 00:20.444
That's 20.30.

00:20.684 --> 00:23.287
Michael Spitzer will pick you up at your hotel.

00:23.307 --> 00:25.009
Do you know him?

00:25.478 --> 00:37.051
You've got to do it, you've got to do it.

00:37.071 --> 00:53.410
No, Novokov, what horrifies me about Novokov

00:54.605 --> 00:57.608
manic attention he gives the books.

00:57.628 --> 01:00.190
I thought he was right, but he's read the damn thing so suddenly.

01:01.251 --> 01:06.977
And the first thing you see in Don Quixote is a drawing of a window.

01:07.697 --> 01:10.960
What did you say in the earlier books was the drawing of the insects?

01:10.980 --> 01:11.861
That's right.

01:12.061 --> 01:19.068
Well, the drawing of... The outlining of the room and place the furniture where he tells you it could be.

01:19.128 --> 01:19.629
That's right.

01:19.649 --> 01:23.312
He had this drawing of Charles Beauvalier's cap, you know, that's what he did.

01:23.900 --> 01:24.981
He's like a wedding cake.

01:25.041 --> 01:29.387
Which I think is a fine way to approach a book.

01:29.407 --> 01:31.049
Do you think he should really try?

01:31.069 --> 01:33.693
Or do you think he's maybe concentrating too much?

01:33.713 --> 01:36.537
No, he had this... I've met him a few times.

01:37.257 --> 01:40.842
I rather liked him, but he was a difficult man.

01:40.862 --> 01:42.304
A difficult, very difficult.

01:42.324 --> 01:43.826
You rather liked my work, which was a help.

01:43.846 --> 01:46.129
You've read my book.

01:47.671 --> 01:49.133
No, please drop in.

01:49.393 --> 01:52.978
My mind was not unlike his, despite everything else.

01:53.515 --> 01:55.036
The problem was he spoke in English.

01:55.517 --> 01:58.319
His English was so heavily accented, which I could never understand.

01:58.339 --> 02:01.542
He didn't seem to have a delicacy of ear to moderate that.

02:03.204 --> 02:07.308
To moderate his phonemic system, he spoke many languages very well.

02:07.688 --> 02:11.952
French is French, but always with a strong Russian accent.

02:11.972 --> 02:14.534
It didn't seem to affect the writing.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.015
It didn't.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.677
Let's really understand.

02:17.697 --> 02:22.982
If you remember the opening of Lolita, you described the first time in

02:23.215 --> 02:28.646
In fiction you get a phonetic description, a fairly exact one.

02:28.746 --> 02:32.453
The name Lolita is described as how you say it.

02:32.473 --> 02:32.854
Lolita.

02:32.874 --> 02:33.255
Lolita.

02:34.558 --> 02:38.105
And yes, he couldn't hear.

02:41.932 --> 02:44.397
But he had this manic.

02:45.575 --> 02:47.077
concern with the appearance.

02:47.317 --> 02:52.104
I think this came from being a lepidopter, the mere examination of butterflies.

02:52.825 --> 02:59.134
Well, I think that's why he loved the Metamorphosis so much.

02:59.254 --> 03:03.680
That and chess, you know, the word games.

03:04.421 --> 03:06.404
He invented Russian Scrabble.

03:06.424 --> 03:08.427
He invented Scrabble in Russia.

03:08.407 --> 03:17.820
I've never caught on in Soviet Union, but great chess players, great chess players, terribly brilliant chess players.

03:17.840 --> 03:25.230
Are you asked frequently to comment on the state-of-the-art fiction writers who you enjoy?

03:25.771 --> 03:28.775
Well, I have to be very unpatriotic about that.

03:28.795 --> 03:31.278
I don't think we're doing very much in Britain.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.980
I can explain why.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.764
I think that in America,

03:36.149 --> 03:37.971
The big things happen, you know.

03:38.131 --> 03:43.538
Have you read Mailer's New Book, Ancient Evenings?

03:43.719 --> 03:45.160
I'm having trouble with it.

03:45.180 --> 03:45.541
I know.

03:45.561 --> 03:49.025
Well, I've been reading it here, but I've got to go home.

03:49.085 --> 03:49.886
I'm sorry.

03:49.926 --> 03:50.767
I'm into it.

03:50.787 --> 03:52.249
I'm about 200 pages.

03:52.510 --> 03:53.511
How are you getting on with it?

03:53.651 --> 03:56.014
Badly.

03:56.905 --> 04:03.051
Well, Benjamin DeMotts, who's not far from here, he's with Amherst.

04:03.131 --> 04:06.354
I met him at Amherst about 30 years ago.

04:07.135 --> 04:13.361
He did this review in the New York Times, Sunday Times.

04:15.363 --> 04:18.186
He says it's a disaster.

04:18.206 --> 04:21.389
But, you see, the point is, I say, all right, that's not the point.

04:21.409 --> 04:25.613
If you compare that with anything that's produced in Britain, or indeed in Europe, generally,

04:26.268 --> 04:28.891
Such terms, I have no idea.

04:30.073 --> 04:36.420
This ambitious project, maybe, that's not the point at all.

04:36.821 --> 04:40.185
The point is that this kind of book comes out of history.

04:40.225 --> 04:41.246
Doesn't come out of history.

04:41.266 --> 04:48.454
I mean, I think the man, pardon my use of the word, doesn't have such walls.

04:48.474 --> 04:49.235
That's it.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.678
Are you familiar with that expression?

04:51.698 --> 04:53.220
I mean, dude.

04:53.588 --> 04:56.012
But he took some courage, I think.

04:56.032 --> 04:56.593
What is it?

04:56.613 --> 04:57.695
I don't know why he wrote it.

04:57.875 --> 05:00.379
I cannot work out why he wrote it.

05:00.419 --> 05:00.780
Why Egypt?

05:00.920 --> 05:08.672
I had lunch with him with a group of other critics in New York in January, and he didn't really answer very satisfactorily there.

05:08.692 --> 05:09.794
I don't know if he could.

05:09.874 --> 05:10.655
I don't think he can.

05:10.816 --> 05:13.580
It all started, he said, 12 years ago.

05:13.640 --> 05:18.448
He was in Egypt, and he stole a client at the top of the pyramid.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.940
He's read a lot.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.081
He's done a lot of research.

05:22.502 --> 05:24.564
Well, that bogs it down, though.

05:24.584 --> 05:25.525
Yes, he does.

05:25.585 --> 05:27.166
It's not a simulation.

05:27.247 --> 05:30.330
Aristotle would quote, I mean, for the lack of action.

05:30.430 --> 05:38.638
Well, you see, when you compare that with a book that is probably less well-regarded by Gore Vidal, you know, Creation, the last week.

05:38.658 --> 05:40.861
I didn't like it.

05:40.901 --> 05:45.145
I didn't dislike it because I saw what he was driving at.

05:45.968 --> 05:51.884
It's too fascinating to not use fiction.

05:51.924 --> 05:59.584
The fact that you have Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Confucianism all beginning at exactly the same time is too fascinating.

05:59.604 --> 06:00.687
I can see the point there.

06:01.375 --> 06:06.722
But this, again, is a very American thing.

06:06.782 --> 06:15.774
Only Americans are willing to look at the past and, you know, write something big about it.

06:15.794 --> 06:18.277
I don't know what the heck's wrong with us in Britain.

06:18.297 --> 06:19.619
I got out of Britain, remember.

06:19.639 --> 06:20.560
I don't live there.

06:20.580 --> 06:25.647
I got out in 1968 when my first wife died and I remade.

06:25.687 --> 06:26.929
He made an Italian girl.

06:26.949 --> 06:30.353
And this drew me to the Mediterranean.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.123
I've not really regretted it.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.084
I go back to London.

06:33.124 --> 06:35.747
I'll be going back after this trip for a couple of days.

06:36.268 --> 06:41.034
It's a foreign city to me, totally foreign, and highly parochial.

06:41.615 --> 06:42.636
Great city, big city.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.798
Highly parochial, highly parochial.

06:44.818 --> 06:46.981
I think New York's a bit the same.

06:47.001 --> 06:50.706
But there are big bits coming in, I think.

06:50.886 --> 06:51.547
Why is that?

06:51.747 --> 06:54.430
I mean, how long has this been going on?

06:54.450 --> 06:55.452
It's been a long time.

06:55.732 --> 06:58.956
It's been going on, I think, since the beginning of the century.

06:59.864 --> 07:29.803
uh even bad big books you like Anthony adverse and things forever amber you know all right, but there's a kind of gusto kind of energy. Which goes back to what you were saying earlier then perhaps now you're asked very conservative. Well the point is not tinkering too much, with no it's a terrible thing to say, but it's your language. No it's not our language anymore. Thank you very much. Could I have some more tea?

07:30.121 --> 07:34.848
It's your language, you see.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.810
The American version of English contains that.

07:36.851 --> 07:39.514
Look, put it on my bill.

07:39.715 --> 07:40.636
It doesn't matter.

07:40.696 --> 07:43.400
It's either my newspaper or your publisher.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.261
Well, you can justify it.

07:44.281 --> 07:45.703
I probably can't.

07:45.763 --> 07:47.626
Why are you buying two records?

07:47.766 --> 07:49.328
Why are you eating so much?

07:49.929 --> 07:54.455
All I need is a receipt.

07:54.876 --> 07:56.578
I'll put it on my voucher.

07:56.599 --> 07:57.279
Don't you feel that?

07:57.340 --> 07:59.082
I mean, what have you read out of England?

08:00.293 --> 08:01.535
Do you know why I enjoyed P.D.

08:01.575 --> 08:03.958
James?

08:03.978 --> 08:04.799
I don't even read him.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.062
She, that's a she.

08:07.082 --> 08:07.423
Exactly.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.384
Shows how little I know.

08:08.564 --> 08:09.345
Shows how little I know.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.108
It's like saying, even in war, I never read it.

08:11.188 --> 08:12.229
I don't like media.

08:12.289 --> 08:14.312
I don't like reading novels.

08:14.332 --> 08:14.653
P.D.

08:14.693 --> 08:17.396
James, I don't even know what she is.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.000
There's Kingsley Amos' son.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.021
Martin, yes.

08:21.061 --> 08:22.123
Well, he's a good writer.

08:22.143 --> 08:23.204
He's become very American.

08:23.304 --> 08:24.806
But I didn't care for his child.

08:25.147 --> 08:26.048
I shouldn't say that.

08:26.872 --> 08:29.175
No, his new novel is about New York.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.398
He spent several months here.

08:31.418 --> 08:33.361
That's when I talked to him.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.463
Researching, I guess.

08:35.483 --> 08:36.164
Do you like the man?

08:36.204 --> 08:36.705
Do you like him?

08:37.807 --> 08:40.029
I didn't spend that much time with him to tell.

08:40.450 --> 08:41.431
He's all right.

08:41.451 --> 08:42.172
You're very kind.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.235
Thank you very much.

08:44.255 --> 08:45.797
That's about right.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.760
Yeah.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.344
We don't want to incriminate ourselves.

08:51.385 --> 08:52.226
Not very much.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.769
No, there's...

08:55.019 --> 09:04.572
There's a young Indian writer who produced a book called Midnight's Children, which is a man called Salman Rushdie.

09:04.592 --> 09:15.928
It's not Anglo-Saxons who are writing something, it's Indians, Chinese, Japanese.

09:15.948 --> 09:24.199
There was a beautiful book that came out last Christmas time from Abrams, but I think it was a reprint from Thames and Hudson.

09:24.550 --> 09:25.872
the English world.

09:25.892 --> 09:26.553
Did you see it?

09:26.653 --> 09:27.254
It's beautiful.

09:27.454 --> 09:28.456
No, I know that.

09:28.476 --> 09:29.397
It's extraordinary photographs.

09:29.417 --> 09:31.420
I know what sort of thing you mean.

09:31.501 --> 09:40.855
Pithy little essays, but... Yes, well, they're bringing out a book, which they should not be bringing out, in my opinion.

09:40.875 --> 09:51.030
During the war, when we were embattled, you know, before America came into the war, when Hitler was going to invade,

09:52.006 --> 10:17.914
We're producing a lot of books about the English countryside and about English culture, English habit, what we are fighting for, and they've produced a series of short books about literature, like Graham Greene on the drama, somebody else on poetry, somebody else on the novel, and very foolishly they're bringing these things out again.

10:17.934 --> 10:21.338
But you can see how, if you look back,

10:22.735 --> 10:26.719
When they're dealing with poetry, for example, there's no mention of Gerard Manny Hopkins.

10:27.640 --> 10:27.901
Why?

10:27.941 --> 10:30.063
Because he was a Jesuit, therefore a kind of foreigner.

10:30.624 --> 10:33.226
He might have been on the side of Hitler.

10:33.246 --> 10:40.654
There's a terrible parochial attitude, which is eternised.

10:40.674 --> 10:44.859
You know, to want to bring out that book again, it's Tamsin Hudson, bring that damn book out again.

10:45.399 --> 10:50.565
They asked me to do the preface and the posthule, you know,

10:51.406 --> 10:55.410
kind of hindsight, and everything I said was unacceptable.

10:55.430 --> 11:04.158
He said, no, you can't say that Mr. Green misquote, or you can't say that Elizabeth Bowen is foolish, you know, you can't say these things.

11:04.939 --> 11:15.849
Graham Green had said in his article that the most powerful line that Shakespeare ever wrote was this, desiring this man's scope and that man's art.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.573
Of course, the other way round, this man's art man's scope.

11:19.891 --> 11:23.236
If you thought this was a great design that Shakespeare wrote, why the hell didn't he get it right?

11:23.276 --> 11:24.959
I said this.

11:25.359 --> 11:27.583
You're not allowed to say that.

11:27.623 --> 11:32.130
The establishment, the literary establishment.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.272
I'm not a member of it.

11:33.332 --> 11:36.977
I don't belong to the literary establishment.

11:37.078 --> 11:42.566
There's one essay in there by Kenneth Murrowich, who I respect.

11:42.646 --> 11:44.429
I do, too.

11:45.210 --> 11:46.312
It was on the language.

11:47.013 --> 11:47.113
Yeah.

11:47.093 --> 11:54.400
and how marvelous a language it is, because it is a great language.

11:54.460 --> 12:02.388
It's a language that allowed Shakespeare to use 29,000 different words, where Racine only used a fraction, like 2,000 words.

12:02.408 --> 12:13.219
And he said it's the only language he could think of that not only has gone to other parts of the world, but where a whole different literary tradition has developed.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.549
I never quite thought of that.

12:16.191 --> 12:20.188
You wanted to compare it with French, especially at the moment, where

12:20.675 --> 12:37.919
The French are waging an official battle, an official, an official battle to keep English out, you know, to abolish words like weekend, the weekend, the field clock, the sporting club, you know.

12:37.939 --> 12:40.622
Of course, the same thing was happening in Canada.

12:40.642 --> 12:44.067
But English say, you know, let's have it, you know, bring it in.

12:44.047 --> 12:46.089
Well, does the English feel that way, though?

12:46.470 --> 12:49.994
The English don't use English very well, he says, as the Americans do.

12:50.715 --> 12:53.879
I mean, I notice French fries with chips over there.

12:53.899 --> 12:58.304
Well, they're not French, you see.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.207
They were invented by the Belgians.

13:00.287 --> 13:01.308
It's a Belgian thing.

13:01.328 --> 13:05.814
Have you ever read the Asterix comics?

13:05.894 --> 13:08.637
I don't think they've caught on here, but...

13:09.342 --> 13:12.226
The French, a very French product.

13:12.527 --> 13:15.632
Beautifully drawn cartoon books.

13:15.652 --> 13:19.778
Asterix is a Gaul.

13:19.798 --> 13:24.545
And it's among the Belgians, among the Britons, of course.

13:24.565 --> 13:29.232
Asterix Chellet-Belge shows the invention of French fries.

13:30.053 --> 13:36.463
Pommes, apples, fried apples, again in Belgium.

13:37.709 --> 13:38.931
We call them chips.

13:39.973 --> 13:43.398
Increasingly, we call them French fries, because the Americans do it.

13:43.418 --> 13:44.119
There were a number of things.

13:44.139 --> 13:47.404
My wife and I were there a couple of years ago.

13:47.545 --> 13:58.622
It was amazing how many different... I wish I had shot some of them down, but just little things where I thought the English were determined to use their word.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.425
Well, the American, of course.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.827
You'll find French fries.

14:02.785 --> 14:05.109
taking presses over chips.

14:05.249 --> 14:06.311
Fish chips is a different thing.

14:06.391 --> 14:06.952
Fish chips.

14:06.992 --> 14:07.674
What about chips?

14:07.734 --> 14:11.420
Would you like chips with your... Your steak, yes.

14:11.440 --> 14:11.761
Chips.

14:12.642 --> 14:15.768
Potato chips here are something that's very important.

14:16.168 --> 14:17.791
We call those crisps.

14:17.811 --> 14:18.232
Crisps.

14:18.332 --> 14:19.094
Potato crisps.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.860
Oh, there are other things, too.

14:23.361 --> 14:24.523
We don't have English markets.

14:25.128 --> 14:26.669
You do, we don't.

14:26.890 --> 14:28.351
What do you call them?

14:28.371 --> 14:28.911
We don't have them.

14:28.931 --> 14:29.452
They don't exist.

14:29.572 --> 14:30.593
They aren't English muffins.

14:30.633 --> 14:31.374
Well, they're not muffins.

14:31.414 --> 14:32.094
Muffins are big.

14:32.655 --> 14:33.836
They used to be when they existed.

14:33.856 --> 14:36.538
But what we call an English muffin doesn't exist in England.

14:36.558 --> 14:38.700
It's a pikelet.

14:38.720 --> 14:38.901
Pikelet.

14:38.941 --> 14:40.802
Pikelets don't exist in there.

14:40.822 --> 14:43.485
English muffins are very American things.

14:43.505 --> 14:48.369
You seem to enjoy writing in very many different forms.

14:48.389 --> 14:49.010
I like writing.

14:49.030 --> 14:50.832
I enjoy it.

14:50.852 --> 14:52.213
It's difficult, but it's difficult.

14:52.253 --> 14:53.474
It becomes more and more difficult.

14:53.494 --> 14:54.095
I enjoy it.

14:54.115 --> 14:54.595
I enjoy writing.

14:55.199 --> 14:59.066
The novel, would you say, is the favourite form?

14:59.086 --> 14:59.948
There's so much to do.

14:59.988 --> 15:08.683
I'm getting old now, and it worries me that I shall not live long enough to write the novel I want to write.

15:08.944 --> 15:11.368
I've got a big novel to try.

15:11.922 --> 15:18.331
standing at the back of my mind, you know, as long as Mailer's, but... That's long.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.652
Yeah, it has to be.

15:19.672 --> 15:21.134
Well, I think the novel should be like that.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.898
I think Mailer's right in seeing the novel as a big thing.

15:24.178 --> 15:28.004
In Britain and even more in France, it's very little.

15:28.024 --> 15:29.766
200 pages, 150.

15:29.786 --> 15:31.208
It's not enough.

15:31.228 --> 15:32.209
It's a novella.

15:32.229 --> 15:40.360
I like the panoramic novel, but in England, we've never had the chance to do this because...

15:40.660 --> 15:44.583
In America, you can get sub-vented to some extent.

15:45.164 --> 15:47.346
You can get onto a campus.

15:47.366 --> 15:52.190
Now, like Mallorca or even Bellow, you've got a salary coming in.

15:52.530 --> 15:55.913
Right, I'll take my time over the next book.

15:55.933 --> 16:07.823
Churn out a big one, but with us, it's always been a matter of trying to live and get out a novel as quickly as possible, which means limiting yourself to over 80,000 words, which is a British novel.

16:08.183 --> 16:10.245
When Anthony Powell,

16:10.833 --> 16:21.003
planned this big novel, his dance and music of time, he saw the only way he could produce it was in installments, segments, 200 pages at a time.

16:21.483 --> 16:27.850
Whereas an American would have waited and brought up the whole gambit to astonish the world.

16:27.870 --> 16:31.333
It's a matter of money, I think, more than anything else.

16:31.353 --> 16:33.595
Are you working on this big novel now?

16:33.615 --> 16:38.600
Well, I've done, yes, I've had other jobs still this year, though.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.722
I've been doing some film by the time.

16:41.208 --> 16:50.436
I don't know whether you saw them, but I wrote the scenarios for two kind of Biblical epics.

16:50.657 --> 16:55.861
One was about Moses, and one was about Jesus Christ.

16:55.941 --> 16:57.983
Definitely.

16:58.003 --> 17:02.728
Well, the novel came first, and then made the script out of the novel.

17:02.748 --> 17:10.995
We're completing the project with a ten-hour series called A.D., which begins with the

17:11.465 --> 17:22.101
dismantling the cross after the crucifixion and then taking it from there, seeing what happened in the Roman Empire with Christian, Paul, Peter and the rest of them.

17:22.121 --> 17:24.043
And I've been doing a lot of research on that.

17:24.564 --> 17:28.630
Will have written, half written the novel, produced

17:29.504 --> 17:43.716
a film script at the same time and then we'll do them as a novel as a fairly this is the novel the big one this is not a big one this is just something which i i get done this summer with a bit of luck

17:44.135 --> 17:48.924
But it's a fascinating story, which nobody seems to know about.

17:49.244 --> 17:53.351
It's a dangerous story, because the Jews come into it.

17:53.732 --> 17:57.038
With regard to the crucifixion of Christ, nobody blames the Jews anymore.

17:57.058 --> 17:58.681
It's the fault of the Romans.

17:58.701 --> 18:07.797
But when it comes to the development of Christianity, then you have to stop blaming the Jews, because in Jerusalem, a lot of

18:08.502 --> 18:13.611
who said they were prepared to become Christians.

18:13.631 --> 18:22.106
But they would only become Christians if the Christian converts in Asia and Greece would be circumcised.

18:23.128 --> 18:29.700
And Paul and Peter said, absurd, you can't say right now, retroactively.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.958
You know, you've got to join the thing properly and be circumcised.

18:33.279 --> 18:38.027
So this was a big issue, a major issue.

18:38.047 --> 18:46.542
So that's why Paul left Palestine and did all the work among the pagans, who didn't worry enough, no question of circumcision.

18:46.522 --> 18:48.584
being trained in Judaism.

18:48.725 --> 18:59.257
It's all about the two major sexual organs.

18:59.357 --> 19:05.524
We all think of Paul as being misogynist, hating women and hating sex.

19:05.544 --> 19:08.367
But when he considered what he had to put up with, he could say, why?

19:08.508 --> 19:14.014
A place like Ephesus and Corinth were

19:14.635 --> 19:18.687
Totally obsessed with the sex goddess, you know, Ashtoreth.

19:18.707 --> 19:19.709
Have you been to Ephesus?

19:20.171 --> 19:21.434
Yes, you did.

19:21.675 --> 19:23.641
No, your Ephesus or the real Ephesus?

19:23.661 --> 19:26.449
The Ephesus in the real world.

19:27.171 --> 19:28.916
The greatest Diana of the Ephesians.

19:28.976 --> 19:30.079
What were you doing there?

19:30.464 --> 19:32.226
My wife and I went through.

19:32.266 --> 19:35.510
We were at our honeymoon, as they say.

19:35.530 --> 19:38.414
You went to Ephesus.

19:38.434 --> 19:39.815
I beg your pardon?

19:39.856 --> 19:40.997
You went to Ephesus.

19:41.017 --> 19:45.402
I dream about it, walking down that big area.

19:46.183 --> 19:48.366
We did Damascus.

19:48.386 --> 19:54.093
It's funny that the street that is straight, where Paul launched, you know.

19:54.113 --> 19:55.535
The character called Ananias.

19:55.715 --> 19:56.556
It's all there.

19:57.498 --> 20:00.921
But this is rather, this to me is rather striking.

20:01.041 --> 20:05.426
Nothing I'd ever heard about in church or in Sunday school.

20:06.327 --> 20:15.336
The big enemy was quite conceivably, quite conceivably, genital herpes.

20:15.356 --> 20:25.986
What I have is... Is that amazing how history turns on... With temple prostitutes indiscriminate sleeping around in honour of the goddess, there must have been a lot of sexual disease.

20:26.422 --> 20:35.571
And it seems to me that Luke was a Greek, a doctor, and became Paul's friend and, you know, wrote the records.

20:36.051 --> 20:39.935
He must have been treating himself.

20:40.015 --> 20:41.837
Now where do you find this?

20:43.138 --> 20:52.868
You only pick up odd hints from close reading of the text and also from reading of good, good commentators, good learned commentators who can

20:53.270 --> 20:55.453
I don't know Hebrew, unfortunately.

20:55.473 --> 20:56.874
It's not one of my languages.

20:56.894 --> 20:58.917
How many languages would you say?

20:59.578 --> 21:04.604
Well, for this kind of job I can cope with Latin and Greek.

21:04.664 --> 21:10.531
It's just a question of what's needed.

21:10.591 --> 21:12.193
If I have to speak the language, I speak it.

21:12.334 --> 21:13.535
It's simple as that.

21:13.555 --> 21:15.177
Well, not so simple.

21:15.730 --> 21:25.260
In doing this kind of job promoting books, it's easy here, thank God I'm speaking English, but if you do it in Sweden, you have to learn Swedish.

21:25.941 --> 21:30.626
I had to give a lecture to the University of Stockholm last year, I had to give it in Sweden.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.588
It's a slow job, you've got to learn it.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.131
It's not a question of learning the word, you've got to learn the intonation.

21:35.171 --> 21:36.533
You learned it for this one speech.

21:37.113 --> 21:37.434
Yes.

21:37.734 --> 21:40.137
Did you retain it after that?

21:40.197 --> 21:42.379
No, I didn't retain any at all.

21:42.848 --> 21:46.557
Do you tend to discard what you consider useful?

21:46.577 --> 21:49.946
It stays at the back there.

21:49.966 --> 21:52.853
How has music influenced your writing?

21:53.134 --> 21:53.655
All the way.

21:54.016 --> 21:54.518
All the way.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.325
It's the art I first practiced.

21:57.345 --> 21:59.811
I've gone back to practicing it.

22:00.837 --> 22:24.589
Indeed, I was going to say that when this particular book was reviewed in Britain by a woman called Lorna Sage, a feminist, and naturally it was a bad book as written by a man, she said, you know, snidely, I suppose, that probably Mr. Burgess has tucked away in a drawer the score of the Trotsky's.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.271
Of course, Mr. Burgess has.

22:26.774 --> 22:39.012
So, when I was interviewed on British radio, I sang and played one of the songs.

22:39.211 --> 22:40.413
Then I did it in Belgium.

22:40.433 --> 22:42.796
I did it in Barcelona.

22:43.357 --> 22:47.263
That seems obvious to me.

22:47.563 --> 22:49.907
I didn't even ask that question.

22:49.947 --> 22:51.529
The book looks out to other things.

22:51.689 --> 22:52.450
It's an open book.

22:52.510 --> 22:54.513
It looks out to other media.

22:55.755 --> 22:57.017
That was the real point of it.

22:57.037 --> 22:57.898
It's not closed in.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.202
It's not an enclosed novel.

23:00.222 --> 23:00.802
It looks out.

23:00.822 --> 23:02.966
That would be a wonderful book.

23:02.986 --> 23:04.528
It might work.

23:04.628 --> 23:07.412
It could work.

23:07.392 --> 23:09.215
Yeah, that's right.

23:09.235 --> 23:13.061
Have you seen that?

23:13.081 --> 23:15.165
Have you seen cats?

23:15.225 --> 23:17.649
I intend to, but it's still in New York.

23:18.050 --> 23:20.173
They come here, aren't they?

23:20.253 --> 23:22.617
They come here, but I'll be down in New York.

23:22.782 --> 23:26.891
I did a musical here in your colonial theatre.

23:26.951 --> 23:29.337
Yes, it's a nice old theatre.

23:29.357 --> 23:34.508
I did a musical version of Cyrano de Béjac, Cyrano, with the customer plumbing.

23:34.528 --> 23:37.595
And you do all the music and the lyrics?

23:37.715 --> 23:42.225
Well, I didn't do the music on that occasion, I did the lyrics, but the music was done by a Welshman.

23:42.543 --> 23:48.190
He does film music, like John Williams.

23:49.611 --> 23:54.938
Being a Welshman, he had no notion at all of English posity.

23:55.298 --> 23:56.520
The Welsh have no sense of stress.

23:56.940 --> 23:58.522
It's not a stress language like French.

23:58.802 --> 23:59.623
No stress in language.

24:00.604 --> 24:04.529
So we ended up by... He couldn't set my lyrics, he said it all wrong.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.032
Putting a stress on the.

24:07.585 --> 24:11.050
So we ended up by his writing the tunes, and I put the words for tunes.

24:11.070 --> 24:17.540
But how specifically would you say the music does influence the actual writing?

24:17.700 --> 24:25.472
Well, I think in the sense that I have attempted to hear a speech tune.

24:25.672 --> 24:34.926
I attempted to hear a sonic pattern, which obviously has to have, obviously is a verbal statement, but I don't know what the verbal statement is.

24:35.581 --> 24:45.034
In the opening paragraph of the novel, we'll often present itself in the form of a pattern of sound, which has to be expressed in words.

24:46.055 --> 24:51.863
You can't take this too far, but I'd like to write a sentence with a kind of tune.

24:52.183 --> 24:54.567
It's got Joyce's sentence.

24:54.587 --> 24:57.230
Every one of Joyce's sentences is a tune.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.053
It's a careful organisation with vowels.

24:59.073 --> 25:01.656
You can sing it.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.843
All day.

25:03.883 --> 25:04.423
Well, I write.

25:04.664 --> 25:06.727
Impulsive, not impulsive.

25:06.747 --> 25:07.909
No, it's just a job.

25:07.929 --> 25:08.410
It's like you.

25:08.430 --> 25:10.073
It's a job.

25:10.113 --> 25:10.834
Le boulot.

25:10.894 --> 25:11.615
Le boulot.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.196
It's a job.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.660
You don't say that to a friend.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.485
If you have a cold or a headache, it's not going to stop you.

25:17.505 --> 25:20.409
No, you've got to get on.

25:20.429 --> 25:22.733
And of course, I don't know whether you work at the weekends.

25:22.773 --> 25:24.456
You probably do.

25:24.917 --> 25:28.703
Since I've been on this job as book editor, I have my weekends.

25:28.723 --> 25:29.584
Thank goodness.

25:29.902 --> 25:30.643
You have them free.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.404
I have them free.

25:31.424 --> 25:33.687
What do you do with them?

25:33.747 --> 25:39.334
I've got two kids, and that explains it right there.

25:39.915 --> 25:46.223
Listen, you're going to be picked up in about 20 minutes, so I don't think you might want to sign it.

25:46.483 --> 25:47.184
Okay.

25:47.324 --> 25:48.766
I wonder if you'd sign my book for me.

25:49.928 --> 25:54.053
We're talking about Frank Gillette Burgess.

25:54.438 --> 25:55.740
He invented a lot of terms.

25:56.220 --> 25:59.565
He's a neologist, a professional neologist.

26:00.165 --> 26:07.775
He invented the word wog, which we use in Britain to mean an Egyptian, Western-oriented gentleman.

26:07.795 --> 26:14.083
But wog, it's a bit of egg that was on the chin of a good-looking girl.

26:14.215 --> 26:17.258
And blurb is the word he invented for... That's a wonderful word.

26:17.798 --> 26:18.279
It is.

26:18.299 --> 26:19.260
The word is stuck.

26:19.340 --> 26:20.261
It's a great invention.

26:20.341 --> 26:21.702
It's a great invention.

26:21.882 --> 26:22.923
Great invention.

26:22.983 --> 26:27.707
Is it old enough to be in the OED, I wonder?

26:27.848 --> 26:29.709
Oh, it's in the OED now.

26:30.070 --> 26:33.212
It's in the supplement.

26:33.232 --> 26:34.614
He was a distant relative.

26:34.774 --> 26:36.055
Not a distant relative.

26:36.095 --> 26:41.220
It's Guy Burgess, the diplomatic traitor.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.501
Bad family, obviously.

26:43.105 --> 26:44.827
That's why I've got your first name.

26:44.987 --> 26:45.748
Nick Nicholas.

26:45.949 --> 26:47.110
It is Nick, all right.

26:47.150 --> 26:47.891
Nick's fine.

26:47.911 --> 26:48.111
Okay.

26:48.332 --> 26:52.777
A man who uses a fountain pen.

26:53.718 --> 26:57.203
Well, you've got a... This has got a... Oh, I use a fountain pen myself.

26:57.223 --> 26:59.526
Do you need to have a cassette in it?

26:59.766 --> 27:01.168
No, I still... Cartridge.

27:01.368 --> 27:02.029
Cartridge.

27:02.149 --> 27:02.730
Cartridge.

27:02.790 --> 27:04.292
No, I fill this.

27:04.532 --> 27:11.962
It's messy, but I... I can check this one.

27:12.102 --> 27:12.302
What?

27:12.603 --> 27:20.163
It's regarded by the Americans as merely productive as spy fiction, you know.

27:20.183 --> 27:21.747
It's again with Ian Fleming.

27:22.710 --> 27:25.718
That's our speciality, espionage.

27:26.035 --> 27:30.521
Now, this new one of the Curry is not anything large, is it?

27:30.541 --> 27:31.503
Well, it is.

27:31.523 --> 27:32.925
It is.

27:32.945 --> 27:33.626
I don't like the man.

27:33.666 --> 27:34.928
I think he probably comes up.

27:35.809 --> 27:46.524
Some, when he produced the last small but one, the Honourable Schoolboy, the New York Times, when he generally said, you can have 3,000 words.

27:46.624 --> 27:50.450
I said, 300 would be enough.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.494
I gave it a very bad review, which I think it deserves.

27:54.267 --> 28:19.887
The Times was upset about it so but they shouldn't say it should well. I find this dramatic occasion. They do that you know. At times in particular will look for tell you how to do it, so they look for the controversy. This is a book by Garrick Freeman you know Margaret Mead out of the water. Well you've heard of it and you know they actually once you found a review of who they knew would be

28:20.457 --> 28:21.058
Hostile.

28:21.138 --> 28:23.059
Hostile too, I get that.

28:23.079 --> 28:25.662
I get that all the time in the New York Review of Books.

28:25.682 --> 28:28.344
They always deliberately choose a hostile view.

28:28.364 --> 28:46.239
But with this thing I did on Le Carré, they couldn't very well change it, but they deliberately published at the side, column by column, all the way along, an interview with Le Carré, which was deliberately... They did again for this... Deliberately geared to a conflict I was saying.

28:46.259 --> 28:50.363
Where I said Mr. Le Carré's style is undistinguished, Le Carré's...

28:50.596 --> 28:52.361
My side is with liberty.

28:52.602 --> 28:57.677
This is very bad, I think.

28:57.958 --> 29:00.606
It's not literature, whatever it is.

29:00.626 --> 29:02.632
The new one is not bad, I have to say.

29:03.554 --> 29:05.179
I have to say.

29:05.598 --> 29:18.516
I think he owes the reader a little more, actually.

29:18.897 --> 29:21.420
Well, what I got against, it was a personal thing.

29:21.481 --> 29:22.662
I don't know whether you get this.

29:22.682 --> 29:24.525
Yes, you get it in America, you get it in Britain.

29:24.545 --> 29:31.475
There was a literary festival, as they call it, in Lancaster, in my native county.

29:31.515 --> 29:32.316
It's a very small town.

29:32.336 --> 29:33.317
It's a county town of Lancaster.

29:33.337 --> 29:34.139
It's a very small town.

29:34.319 --> 29:35.200
It's a very old and small town.

29:35.686 --> 29:46.661
And there were no hotels there, there was only one hotel, and McCarrie was invited as I was, and when McCarrie discovered I was there, and there was only one hotel, he used to stay in the district.

29:46.821 --> 29:52.709
He stayed outside, probably stayed in his private jet plane or something like that.

29:52.789 --> 29:58.437
It is mean, mean-minded.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.021
I like other people.

30:00.101 --> 30:02.664
I'm very fond of Frederick Forsyth.

30:02.724 --> 30:03.644
Do you know him?

30:03.664 --> 30:04.986
I've talked to him.

30:05.006 --> 30:06.027
I think he's a good man.

30:06.047 --> 30:07.328
He knows precisely what he's doing.

30:07.988 --> 30:09.610
No pretensions at all.

30:10.290 --> 30:15.895
I reread the book, his last book, but one, The Devil's Church.

30:16.036 --> 30:17.237
I thought it was very good.

30:17.637 --> 30:19.379
I thought it was extremely well-booked.

30:19.399 --> 30:22.882
Especially where he's very happy not writing, too, I think.

30:22.902 --> 30:25.444
Yes, where he's written a very good volume of short stories.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.805
That was excellent.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.727
I thought it was fantastic.

30:28.707 --> 30:31.992
The one of not the snakes in Ireland.

30:32.172 --> 30:32.693
Admirable.

30:32.713 --> 30:33.033
Where is it?

30:33.053 --> 30:34.155
It's this Pakistan.

30:34.175 --> 30:35.958
It goes back and thinks it's a snake.

30:36.939 --> 30:38.361
And it's a female snake.

30:38.521 --> 30:40.224
It's a marvelous idea.

30:40.244 --> 30:41.425
It's snakes in your mind.

30:41.586 --> 30:42.267
Wonderful idea.

30:42.347 --> 30:48.175
Well, The Devil's alternative he did because his wife finally said, well, for God's sakes, your boy.

30:48.195 --> 30:49.577
Who publishes it here?

30:49.597 --> 30:49.958
Viking.

30:50.258 --> 30:51.420
Oh, Viking.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.962
It's a fairly small breast, isn't it?

30:52.982 --> 30:53.443
A little big.

30:53.803 --> 30:54.585
It's a big novel.

30:54.605 --> 30:55.386
It's grown.

30:55.406 --> 30:55.626
It's grown.

30:55.808 --> 30:58.370
Well, you've heard of Stephen King, who I've never heard.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.451
Indeed I have, yeah.

30:59.471 --> 31:07.258
I was chatting with one of their editors, Vikings editors, who was at the Clark University last spring, which is in Worcester, in South Africa.

31:07.278 --> 31:07.899
Yeah, yeah.

31:10.301 --> 31:12.883
And he said that... You call it Worcester, you don't call it Worcester.

31:12.923 --> 31:14.865
No, Worcester.

31:16.126 --> 31:19.309
And he said that Stephen King accounts for 10% of their gross.

31:19.429 --> 31:22.051
You know, they probably publish 200 titles a year.

31:22.852 --> 31:23.993
And for one author...

31:24.293 --> 31:27.076
And this guy was King's editor as well.

31:27.157 --> 31:29.359
And he's a very good editor, Alan Williams.

31:29.379 --> 31:30.260
I can't read King.

31:30.401 --> 31:31.061
I've tried to.

31:31.121 --> 31:32.143
I can't read him.

31:32.163 --> 31:32.603
I've tried to.

31:32.623 --> 31:34.045
I have books in my book.

31:34.065 --> 31:40.533
But it was so amusing to see this fellow as an editor try and defend him in a literary way.

31:41.194 --> 31:42.796
I'll tell you another writer I can't read.

31:43.016 --> 31:47.462
I've been trying to read the Parsifal mosaic.

31:47.482 --> 31:48.603
That's Robert Ludlow.

31:48.623 --> 31:50.065
I cannot understand him.

31:50.585 --> 31:53.029
The word was he didn't even write that stuff.

31:53.490 --> 31:54.231
Can you understand?

31:54.251 --> 31:55.593
I can't understand what's going on.

31:55.693 --> 31:56.435
I've only read one.

31:56.575 --> 31:57.276
I feel like I'm a fool.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.237
I'm not an idiot.

31:58.258 --> 31:59.099
I can't understand what happened.

31:59.119 --> 32:01.082
I read one because I had to because these things.

32:01.302 --> 32:05.289
When I took over his book editor, I said, I've got to read one of these things so I know what I'm dealing with.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.374
So I can know who to assign them to for reading.

32:09.029 --> 32:11.993
The nice position I'm in is that I don't want to read it myself.

32:12.254 --> 32:35.068
But, you know, on the other hand, you can, probably like yourself, I usually pick up a paperback, you know, at the airport, to eat a plane, deliberately non-literature, and I picked up a book with author I've already forgotten, I've never heard of it before, I haven't even got the title, I think it's called The Hastings Conspiracies, but it's America and Russia again, you know, the perennial theme.

32:35.088 --> 32:37.872
It's about Britain, Britain's become over-socialized.

32:38.273 --> 32:40.816
And America is going to invade Britain.

32:43.018 --> 32:45.841
And, you know, it's remarkably well put together.

32:45.861 --> 32:48.103
You know, he describes, he's an American writer.

32:48.123 --> 32:49.545
He describes certain towns of Britain.

32:49.565 --> 32:50.626
He knows these towns.

32:50.706 --> 32:53.268
He knows the way the British speak.

32:53.288 --> 32:56.291
He knows Chequers, whether you're the Prime Minister's weekend residence.

32:56.312 --> 32:57.052
He knows this.

32:57.072 --> 33:03.159
You know, I do admire this willingness to take a few notes, which I can't do myself.

33:03.179 --> 33:04.500
I can't be bothered.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.020
Is that right?

33:05.361 --> 33:06.542
Oh, I'm a bad researcher.

33:07.079 --> 33:12.888
I always have an excuse, you see.

33:12.928 --> 33:20.981
The last book, Percy Powers, was full of errors, and these were partly deliberate.

33:21.041 --> 33:24.767
There's an old man trying to remember the past, getting it wrong, you see.

33:25.523 --> 33:32.536
But one reviewer in Britain spent the whole page misting the arrows, because I knew these arrows pretty well.

33:32.816 --> 33:40.029
I haven't seen anyone yet take you to task for a misinterpretable toy to trust you.

33:40.049 --> 33:46.401
Well, they'll find I'm wrong on his sonicals.

33:47.562 --> 33:49.766
It's pretty easy enough done.

33:49.826 --> 33:54.914
Imagine a particular bank existed in 1918 when it was only founded in 1930, you know, that kind of thing.

33:54.935 --> 33:57.859
It's the kind of era one makes all the time.

33:58.921 --> 34:01.245
Graham Greene gets very worried about it.

34:01.305 --> 34:02.888
He wrote a novel.

34:03.290 --> 34:09.019
called The Human Factor, which I rather like.

34:09.059 --> 34:18.895
In the first few pages, he has people buying a kind of chocolate confection called Maltesers in an ABC shop on Strand.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.561
ABC is an aerated bread company.

34:22.581 --> 34:27.930
It existed in HG Wells' time, but it doesn't exist any longer.

34:28.045 --> 34:30.669
And I said, you're wrong there, Graham.

34:31.029 --> 34:31.710
It's very wrong.

34:31.770 --> 34:35.876
I'll change it in the next edition, because it never does.

34:36.497 --> 34:40.223
He got the adjective Gibraltee, which is a Gibraltarian, which I pointed out.

34:40.383 --> 34:41.665
Is he angry about that?

34:41.685 --> 34:42.846
Is he angry at being corrected?

34:43.948 --> 34:45.750
Is he angry at making a mistake?

34:45.871 --> 34:47.173
He's angry that anybody notices it.

34:48.014 --> 34:49.035
He should not notice the energy.

34:49.055 --> 34:50.998
He's too big a man to look for that.

34:51.704 --> 34:53.346
Do you think he'll win the Nobel Prize?

34:53.687 --> 34:54.067
Never.

34:54.127 --> 34:57.132
Do you think he's deserving?

34:59.235 --> 34:59.295
No.

34:59.315 --> 35:03.581
Bach, my namesake Bach is certainly the only man who is.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.864
This Marques character is not.

35:05.884 --> 35:08.067
That was on the basis of one book.

35:08.087 --> 35:10.431
Marques and Canetti is another one.

35:10.451 --> 35:12.513
Ridiculous.

35:12.534 --> 35:15.718
The Pole, though, I thought.

35:15.758 --> 35:20.665
The trouble was, I was up for the Nobel Prize, but Canetti got it.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.825
That's why he got it.

35:22.845 --> 35:38.187
I knew I was up for the Nobel, because I was in Stockholm just before the Liberations, and I was in the Nobel Library, and they had all my books together on the trolley, so I was going through them.

35:39.569 --> 35:40.771
Who did you nominate, sir?

35:41.131 --> 35:49.403
Well, there was a committee, and there were various members of the committee who had been on it a long time, and they had very violent prejudices.

35:49.822 --> 35:52.669
A very fine Danish writer, Isak Dinesen.

35:53.270 --> 35:54.674
What a wonderful biography.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.997
Yes, a great writer, a fine writer.

35:56.017 --> 36:00.367
But she was up for the prize, and Hemingway said she should get it.

36:00.387 --> 36:01.289
That's right.

36:01.570 --> 36:04.978
But the member of the committee said, I will never submit to...

36:05.465 --> 36:09.492
The prize has been given to somebody who shoots lions.

36:09.512 --> 36:15.923
Well, you know, Hemingway shot lions, or he said he did, and he got it.

36:15.963 --> 36:26.021
There's a very powerful homosexual on the committee who was determined that the prize goes to Patrick White in Australia because of the homosexuals.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.485
So it's not quite too impartial to imagine.

36:28.718 --> 36:30.420
I don't think you have to take it.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.301
The money is useful.

36:31.462 --> 36:34.966
I mean, the prestige is extremely useful.

36:35.127 --> 36:36.609
But the prestige is useful.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.532
But when the prize has been awarded, the writer then gives the kind.

36:43.137 --> 36:44.920
I mean, consider who didn't get it.

36:45.140 --> 36:46.562
Warren's never got it.

36:46.642 --> 36:47.503
Joyce never got it.

36:47.737 --> 36:48.819
Joyce.

36:48.879 --> 36:49.099
Joyce.

36:49.259 --> 36:49.740
Joyce.

36:49.760 --> 36:49.900
Joyce.

36:51.022 --> 36:51.162
Joyce.

36:51.182 --> 36:51.523
Joyce.

36:51.743 --> 36:52.124
Joyce.

36:52.184 --> 36:53.385
They never heard of Joyce.

36:53.546 --> 36:54.787
Never heard of him.

36:55.188 --> 36:57.371
Did they pass over Eugene O'Neill, I think?

36:57.552 --> 36:59.474
They passed him over, I guess.

36:59.494 --> 37:02.539
On the other hand, Sinclair Lewis got it.

37:02.559 --> 37:03.581
Sinclair Lewis.

37:03.601 --> 37:03.701
True.

37:03.841 --> 37:09.289
And Beckett got it because his translator in Stockholm, I guess.

37:09.573 --> 37:11.455
a badge of the committee all the time.

37:11.475 --> 37:14.038
For Christ's sake, give him what nothing for him.

37:14.058 --> 37:17.302
Faulkner was deserving, I think, when he was Faulkner.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.524
Faulkner deserved it all the way.

37:19.125 --> 37:19.645
All the way.

37:20.326 --> 37:22.409
Fitzgerald, I think, is questionable.

37:22.429 --> 37:22.929
I think so.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.112
I think Eliot probably deserved it.

37:25.132 --> 37:27.375
Pound deserved it.

37:27.395 --> 37:29.277
Well, again, it comes back to the politics.

37:29.437 --> 37:31.259
Yes, that's why Marquez got it.

37:32.681 --> 37:34.163
Have you read Marquez's new novel?

37:34.362 --> 37:35.063
I haven't.

37:35.524 --> 37:36.166
I reviewed it.

37:36.186 --> 37:41.677
I really believe one of your magazines.

37:42.258 --> 37:44.243
I wasn't too happy about it.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.465
Just one fast question.

37:45.746 --> 37:49.213
It just comes to mind when we're talking about politics and writing.

37:49.874 --> 37:55.105
I have found that so many very fine writers, when they become politicized,

37:55.085 --> 37:59.249
It destroys them, right?

37:59.570 --> 38:01.712
Do you agree with that?

38:02.873 --> 38:06.497
I think it's easier for the British, probably easier for the Americans.

38:06.537 --> 38:07.558
We're not political people.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.220
We don't really have big political trouble.

38:10.240 --> 38:19.630
I mean, one of the Democrats and Republicans, you know, it's not like the communists and the fascists, you know, in Britain.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.753
There's no real party strife, it doesn't exist.

38:22.773 --> 38:24.535
So we're not a political people.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.634
I can't think of political terms.

38:26.694 --> 38:33.394
This harms me in countries like Italy, where I expect a strong political message.

38:33.615 --> 38:37.647
If I said on one occasion to an interviewer,

38:37.913 --> 38:45.103
I think Pope John's disaster, you see, and the next day the headline was, Burgess et fascista, fascista.

38:46.485 --> 38:48.047
They always think in critical terms.

38:48.147 --> 38:50.630
That's because the publishing becomes ruined by political parties.

38:51.131 --> 38:57.760
But I mean in terms of the writing itself of these people, soldier Nixon comes to mind immediately.

38:57.780 --> 38:58.321
What has he done?

38:58.341 --> 38:59.542
He's mad, he's mad.

38:59.583 --> 39:02.166
That's worthwhile since... He's not a great writer.

39:02.399 --> 39:03.300
He's a great engineer.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.442
I mean, I agree with Goldfield.

39:04.462 --> 39:06.324
He's a great engineer.

39:06.384 --> 39:09.889
No, I mean, people buy his work, but they don't read it.

39:09.969 --> 39:11.251
August 1914 was not reading it.

39:12.753 --> 39:13.974
I don't think anybody read it.

39:13.994 --> 39:15.396
A day in the life of Irving.

39:15.416 --> 39:16.177
Well, it's brief.

39:16.237 --> 39:17.439
It's brief.

39:17.499 --> 39:18.360
It's okay.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.381
It's okay.

39:19.441 --> 39:20.623
The cancer war.

39:20.643 --> 39:23.727
The cancer war was just an American bestseller.

39:23.787 --> 39:25.629
Irving Wallace.

39:25.710 --> 39:28.994
I don't like the man anyway.

39:29.194 --> 39:29.875
I don't like it.

39:30.344 --> 39:32.446
But I feel there's something very fishy about him.

39:32.566 --> 39:36.490
I went to see him in Geneva, in Zurich.

39:36.610 --> 39:39.472
And a few of us went.

39:39.513 --> 39:40.153
I was interested to go.

39:40.173 --> 39:40.914
I didn't have to go.

39:40.934 --> 39:43.897
I was interested to go interviewing him with a few other journalists.

39:43.977 --> 39:48.121
And he didn't give us a drink, you know.

39:48.201 --> 39:49.582
He would like a cup of tea, another night.

39:49.602 --> 39:50.963
He would like vodka, you know.

39:51.364 --> 39:52.144
He was drinking vodka.

39:52.184 --> 39:54.687
He was on the telephone, I was around to Moscow.

39:54.707 --> 39:57.229
On the telephone to Moscow, on a hot line.

39:57.682 --> 40:09.379
Well, listen, you have to go to another...
