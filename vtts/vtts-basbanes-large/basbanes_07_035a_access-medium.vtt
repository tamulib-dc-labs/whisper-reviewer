WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:03.364
Here we go.

00:03.384 --> 00:03.685
Okay.

00:04.906 --> 00:12.978
You see, I'll ask you a question, Bill Stolman, we're at the Shiny Library, and I always ask you how you describe the focus of the collection.

00:13.740 --> 00:22.232
And I start by talking my way around the room with manuscripts and early printed books and human books, and then Bibles, it works.

00:22.252 --> 00:28.241
And, I mean, you can see Bibles in a number of different languages.

00:28.261 --> 00:28.722
I mean, you know, in...

00:30.541 --> 00:32.042
Greek and that kind of thing.

00:32.062 --> 00:41.250
And then we get into more Bibles, and then it moves quickly into Renaissance material, particularly Reformation and Luther.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.474
And then there are funny kind of chunks.

00:45.534 --> 00:51.519
There's a kind of reference chunk in there that I very rarely use.

00:51.539 --> 01:00.447
You remember that, I mean, this was a library when his father had it, but it was out in Titusville that had no major reference library near it.

01:00.730 --> 01:06.616
So there are kind of chunks of reference works that, if it had always been here, wouldn't be here.

01:06.636 --> 01:10.940
They'd be in Princeton, and they'd just go next door to use them.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.962
And then the next alcove is American.

01:13.242 --> 01:14.664
These are called alcoves?

01:14.684 --> 01:14.904
Yeah.

01:16.426 --> 01:19.188
Go ahead, you can just talk, and I'm just going to take a few notes when I speak.

01:19.228 --> 01:28.898
The next alcove is American, and that's where the early American printing is, and that's where the grant material is, the Civil War.

01:29.722 --> 01:35.249
And then the next album is Further American, South America's work.

01:38.473 --> 01:45.422
And then the second and last album is kind of great books in general sense.

01:45.482 --> 01:54.673
That's where Locke and there's Tristan Shandy and Faust and that kind of thing.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.557
These are first firsts, right?

01:57.577 --> 01:57.737
Yeah.

01:58.223 --> 02:02.347
You see, but there's a kind of funny, I mean, there's a lost cave with all the books.

02:02.427 --> 02:07.492
I mean, there's the later editions of Bunyan and other works about Bunyan.

02:07.512 --> 02:18.563
There's the thing that Einstein first appeared in, reporting on the, you know, theory of relativity.

02:18.603 --> 02:21.006
You know, Smith and Locke and that kind of thing.

02:21.326 --> 02:24.349
And then you get into, you know, something that's kind of ordinary.

02:24.683 --> 02:27.708
The Dictionary of National Biography and books.

02:27.728 --> 02:44.914
And then the final one tends to be Voyages of Discovery, with a particular emphasis on Mexico and America, and then you get into Mexico.

02:44.934 --> 02:46.656
That's spectacular.

02:46.676 --> 02:52.986
You would say the actual focus of the collection probably was Mr. Shady's father, not the grandfather.

02:53.219 --> 03:18.450
I mean, it was his, the story that they've seen him probably write a couple of times was that his father came to Princeton and heard somewhere in a Western CIS class that the two events which, the two greatest events in the history of the world, which is one of those things only a professor and a first year Western CIS can say, was the discovery of America and the discovery of the printing press.

03:19.004 --> 03:23.671
No, I suspect it was a class on, you know, 15th century or something.

03:23.831 --> 03:36.529
Those were the two things, and so those were the things that he began thinking about, and how the two of them occurred, you know, within 50 years of one another, and what it was that people were doing in that class.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.996
The family, what makes this all possible, of course, is Pennsylvania oil, is that right?

03:41.757 --> 03:45.162
Did that continue through the generations, or did they diversify?

03:45.522 --> 03:46.163
I'm not too sure.

03:46.183 --> 03:48.066
I'm not sure either.

03:49.025 --> 03:56.495
I mean, I... His father... This is not all that important, but I'm just... No, I mean, I think they must have diversified.

03:56.515 --> 03:59.219
It certainly is out of his hands at this point.

03:59.259 --> 04:07.110
I mean, in the sense that he has bankers and money managers in New York with whom he taught, I think, every day.

04:07.790 --> 04:11.916
But, I mean... Ask him what he does professionally.

04:12.076 --> 04:13.638
What would you say, investor?

04:13.658 --> 04:15.621
No, he'd say he's a musicologist.

04:15.641 --> 04:17.604
Really?

04:17.624 --> 04:18.525
And this is how he is?

04:19.012 --> 04:34.636
Yeah, I mean, he would say, I just did a CV for him, because somebody's been nominated for the membership in the American Philosophical Society.

04:34.736 --> 04:41.847
I mean, I'll tell you, he would never tell you, you can't repeat it.

04:41.867 --> 04:46.133
I mean, somebody wants money for something.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.395
He graduated from Princeton in 36.

04:48.435 --> 04:51.058
This is great because I don't want to waste his time.

04:51.999 --> 05:04.791
He then, let me get the things I'll get you.

05:04.811 --> 05:08.055
In 1940, he got a master's in music from Columbia.

05:09.776 --> 05:15.462
And from 1940 to 42, he taught at Cornell in the music department there.

05:18.192 --> 05:21.997
So his adding to the collection in those areas is a natural.

05:22.077 --> 05:23.779
He's a natural as far as he, yeah.

05:24.580 --> 05:30.587
And then, I mean, the TV goes 46 to 80, he was director of the Bach aria group.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.410
So he would say he was a musicologist.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.415
And there's no problem with my asking him that.

05:37.435 --> 05:39.698
No, no.

05:39.718 --> 05:45.465
I'm really looking for impressions, feelings, you know, what it's like to come in here.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.193
This is his.

05:49.315 --> 05:54.403
And that's why they go through that little funny song and dance where they renounce all of this.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.145
I mean, they never actually came in without knocking.

05:56.586 --> 05:59.951
Because, I mean, somehow they've worked out an arrangement with Prince's.

05:59.971 --> 06:03.116
This is his library, and you're on private property.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.820
Now, technically, you may not, but they have to.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.302
It's like an embassy or something.

06:08.311 --> 06:10.514
like the Vatican seal.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.036
Exactly, exactly.

06:12.056 --> 06:16.722
I mean, you don't, I mean, they all, the secretaries always, I told them to don't bother, just come on in.

06:16.803 --> 06:18.004
I'm sure it's been etched.

06:18.525 --> 06:19.727
But they always stop.

06:22.590 --> 06:28.398
Tell me a little bit about yourself, Phil, how you've come to this position.

06:29.220 --> 06:34.707
I was, I have a doctorate in medieval studies, and

06:35.817 --> 06:46.108
did university administration for four years in Toronto, University of Toronto, at Victoria College, and then taught for a couple of years at the University of Windsor.

06:47.249 --> 06:51.354
And, I mean, I was doing administration because the job market was tight.

06:51.374 --> 06:52.094
Are you Canadian?

06:52.134 --> 06:54.237
Yeah, I'm a Canadian citizen.

06:56.539 --> 07:03.066
And I got this job teaching, a 10-year-old student job, and I bought a house, and I thought I was at the University of Windsor, and I thought I was there for that.

07:03.947 --> 07:04.828
And then he called.

07:05.348 --> 07:07.830
Did you know who he was?

07:08.211 --> 07:09.432
Yeah, I know who he was.

07:09.552 --> 07:12.755
I'd been down and used the library.

07:12.775 --> 07:13.515
He wasn't here.

07:13.535 --> 07:16.058
I didn't meet him on that occasion.

07:16.078 --> 07:22.784
I met him at a Library of Congress in Poland on 15th century.

07:22.824 --> 07:32.092
But he was looking for a librarian because Minor Bryant, who was here the whole life, except for some time at the Jefferson Bridge, and who had been hired by his father.

07:32.112 --> 07:35.035
And he was really like an aunt to the children.

07:35.690 --> 07:37.593
had died.

07:38.113 --> 07:55.758
And then Janet Eames, who's been at Mills College, who was a librarian for almost two years, she was working here in Arthur Freeman, who works at Quaritch in London, but is an American.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.782
She and Arthur got married, so she moved to London.

07:58.802 --> 08:02.527
And he was looking for it.

08:02.547 --> 08:04.850
And he said, you know, what I'd be interested.

08:04.870 --> 08:05.511
And I said, well,

08:05.980 --> 08:12.168
I didn't think that I was really what I wanted.

08:12.188 --> 08:13.390
First of all, I was a Canadian.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.994
I wasn't a librarian.

08:16.014 --> 08:21.862
I had a 10-year-old dream job, and that's why I sent my computer, and he worked something out.

08:21.882 --> 08:23.123
I was very, very happy.

08:23.143 --> 08:24.926
It'll be two years in July.

08:24.946 --> 08:26.588
It must be, if you love the book.

08:26.728 --> 08:28.591
Oh, it's wonderful.

08:28.691 --> 08:29.612
It's wonderful.

08:29.632 --> 08:30.894
It's wonderful.

08:30.914 --> 08:32.096
I mean, there's no castle.

08:32.116 --> 08:34.519
You're working for a very beautiful...

08:35.191 --> 08:38.674
I mean, it has it.

08:38.694 --> 08:39.315
Everything does.

08:39.495 --> 08:40.076
Everything does.

08:40.096 --> 08:42.598
I mean, you know, you work for one person, that's who you report to.

08:42.678 --> 08:46.201
If that one person's feeling grumpy, you have to put up with it.

08:46.982 --> 08:49.905
I mean, it has its advantage.

08:49.945 --> 08:55.430
I mean, I don't go to meetings, which is one of the biggest advantages.

08:55.450 --> 08:58.173
I mean, I enjoyed teaching, but I enjoyed research.

08:58.193 --> 08:59.954
You could teach a couple of courses here.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.797
Oh, then, yeah, I taught at night school here.

09:03.257 --> 09:03.898
I should think that

09:04.233 --> 09:15.809
Well, yeah, but this is Princeton, and they don't have to rush into anything too soon, so I'm sort of... How does this collection support scholarship?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.672
I think that's kind of the stipulation, right?

09:17.712 --> 09:20.436
Princeton agrees to this.

09:20.556 --> 09:24.101
I'm sure they agreed to it for the long term as well.

09:25.363 --> 09:30.730
However, I think they did say that...

09:31.233 --> 09:32.315
the research.

09:32.335 --> 09:32.936
Is that right?

09:32.976 --> 09:35.220
How does it support the scholarship?

09:35.700 --> 09:41.390
I mean, it's open to anybody with proper deliberation.

09:41.410 --> 09:49.964
The way that Princeton read books is open to anybody with proper deliberation.

09:49.984 --> 09:56.735
I mean, I had a student here this morning from Westminster Choir College, who's a student conducting the music.

09:56.755 --> 09:57.797
He wanted to look at

09:59.110 --> 10:03.174
And, you know, she registered as a reader with Princeton, and that's fine.

10:03.194 --> 10:05.876
And we let them in, and we look at them.

10:05.896 --> 10:06.897
The material stays here.

10:06.917 --> 10:19.588
The material stays here, or sometimes if I'm running around, I give it to Princeton, and they have a reading room, and somebody who watches the reading will keep traffic, but it counts the pages that go in, and counts the pages that go out.

10:20.189 --> 10:25.473
So it's much easier for me if I don't have to stay here and watch them.

10:25.493 --> 10:28.476
Do you ever discuss, I'll ask them,

10:29.671 --> 10:34.697
What's the future of the Shaggy collection?

10:34.717 --> 10:40.744
I mean, is this something that you're privy to?

10:40.924 --> 10:41.825
I know he has a daughter.

10:41.845 --> 10:46.010
He has two daughters and a son.

10:46.891 --> 10:48.053
I mean, I don't know what he'll tell you.

10:48.073 --> 10:58.345
I mean, obviously it's... Yeah, I mean, what he'll tell you is that maybe none of your business is going to answer that, but it'll go to Princeton.

10:59.675 --> 11:04.482
if his will stays the way it is.

11:04.522 --> 11:28.416
And the reason I would want to ask that question, certainly he must be mindful of exactly, it is, if it's not unique, the collection is three generations, but then I get this, I think, estate, and I'm sure Princeton has made all the necessaries

11:30.117 --> 11:33.782
assurances that it would be made as a shiny collection.

11:33.802 --> 11:35.724
It has for 25 years.

11:35.744 --> 11:39.649
I mean, it's no small expense on Princeton's part.

11:39.910 --> 11:46.999
I mean, he pays my salary, but they, you know, past support services are no small.

11:47.660 --> 11:50.944
Well, considering what they're getting, I suppose.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.629
But, I mean, you know, 25 years is a long time.

11:54.649 --> 11:57.593
Have you ever heard of such a new agent like this?

11:57.775 --> 11:59.417
Well, Princeton's done it before.

11:59.457 --> 12:02.740
You could talk to Bill Joyce or somebody.

12:02.760 --> 12:12.110
There's a man named Robert Taylor, who you may have heard of, and the Taylor Library is here in Princeton, in another part of their books.

12:12.130 --> 12:26.044
And Bob Taylor is particularly interested in English literature, moving, I think, more towards Victorian, but a big collection of Max Beerbund,

12:26.395 --> 12:27.577
and that kind of thing.

12:27.597 --> 12:30.601
And he had his library.

12:32.564 --> 12:35.528
I mean, there's a shitey room.

12:35.548 --> 12:37.631
There's a tailor room, and he felt it.

12:38.072 --> 12:43.019
And had a librarian who he paid, who worked here at New York before.

12:43.039 --> 12:48.307
And when he died, it became a tailor collection.

12:48.487 --> 12:56.098
I mean, it's only a local thing, but it's a library while the person is alive, and that becomes a collection.

12:56.382 --> 12:58.485
when they're done.

12:58.505 --> 13:10.002
But they, I mean, they still make, Taylor left money, and so they still make acquisitions.

13:10.022 --> 13:24.162
I was at the Morgan, I spent a couple hours at the Morgan yesterday, and I bought the Heinemann Collection, and it is, it does continue similarly as the Heinemann Collection, which they

13:24.817 --> 13:28.282
And that's very rich in music, by the way.

13:28.822 --> 13:31.626
I had not even heard of that collection before.

13:31.646 --> 13:33.428
I went to the illuminated manuscript.

13:33.448 --> 13:35.351
Oh yeah, the dust, that was just amazing.

13:35.371 --> 13:40.958
And the Morgan had those boxes up there, which are the envy of half the people in the museum world.

13:40.978 --> 13:41.359
That's right.

13:41.599 --> 13:48.588
And those are expensive to do, because they'd screw up this little wall, and then they'd take them off, and you'd fill the holes, and you'd paint or re-paper.

13:48.608 --> 13:51.752
But it does, as much, because the light's coming at you,

13:52.087 --> 13:53.209
It's almost like stained glass.

13:53.229 --> 13:54.671
Yeah, it's like stained glass.

13:54.891 --> 13:56.333
It's a hell of those things.

13:56.393 --> 14:06.808
I've interviewed one of the, the person who owns one of the manuscripts, Arthur Bruch-Boward, you know, have you ever heard about him?

14:06.828 --> 14:12.396
He and his wife are private collectors, and he's very quiet.

14:13.117 --> 14:15.580
I'm the first person they've ever talked to.

14:15.880 --> 14:23.850
He's the president of the Boston Athenaeum, his wife is president of the Friends of Holden Library, so that's very well-connected.

14:23.870 --> 14:28.376
And I'm sharing with Mr. Shady Wilson.

14:28.396 --> 14:31.159
I know him.

14:31.179 --> 14:40.010
But they have a very small collection, 1,000, 1,500, but... Yeah, oh yeah.

14:40.030 --> 14:42.073
That, I would think, the majority of people.

14:42.610 --> 14:48.257
who are collectors would be, I mean, it tends to be a manageable kind of side that you know.

14:48.277 --> 14:52.082
I mean, you also get, it seems, some fairly particular interests.

14:52.523 --> 14:56.989
I mean, there are very few people that collect on any kind of wide range.

14:57.009 --> 14:59.092
I think it's best to guess instead of part of sources.

14:59.112 --> 15:08.424
Yes, I mean, you get to know what makes something special.

15:08.444 --> 15:09.946
A series of collections.

15:10.847 --> 15:10.947
Yeah.

15:12.327 --> 15:37.115
you know, Princeton has the Junius Morgan collection of Virgil, and the so-and-so, the Patterson collection of Horvath, and somebody's collection of Ernest Hemingway, and somebody's, you know, they tend to just, having, I think, there's something about book collectors, having spent the time focusing on that material, getting it all together, and having made notes and records of how it all relates.

15:37.135 --> 15:38.096
And getting the best copies.

15:38.116 --> 15:41.760
And getting the best copies available, then to say,

15:43.563 --> 15:45.525
You know, I don't care what happens to it.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.588
Let's have a big auction and let it be dispersed again.

15:47.608 --> 15:48.429
Well, some say that.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.190
Some say that.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.231
I mean, that's what Bradley Martin said.

15:50.251 --> 15:51.673
Bradley Martin said it.

15:51.693 --> 15:55.979
And there's a famous quote by Robert Hull, who was one of the fonds.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.342
I have the catalog of it.

15:58.362 --> 16:01.586
It's Beverly Chew closing in the introduction.

16:01.606 --> 16:01.946
Yeah.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.870
If it weren't for collectors, where would I have gotten that?

16:05.030 --> 16:09.997
And I want to return it so other collectors could have the fun that I had or something along those lines.

16:10.918 --> 16:12.760
But that's a fairly rare...

16:14.039 --> 16:21.926
I mean, most people kind of see it as some kind of monument or something that they've worked on and they want it to remain intact.

16:21.946 --> 16:28.993
Well, if it's a really exceptional collection, as this is, that is not likely to be replicated.

16:29.013 --> 16:29.714
No, no.

16:29.914 --> 16:30.595
That's the problem.

16:30.755 --> 16:38.282
But, I mean, that's why when you mentioned this collector in Newton, you know, that they have a kind of small choice.

16:38.522 --> 16:43.607
I was at their houses a couple of weeks ago and took out this

16:44.093 --> 16:45.395
Book of Hours.

16:46.517 --> 16:48.800
It was beautiful, and it illuminated stuff.

16:48.820 --> 16:51.224
And he said, but no, he said, read the inscription.

16:51.324 --> 16:54.209
Well, it was, pray for me as I pray for you.

16:54.329 --> 17:04.945
It was an inscribed, an inscribed Book of Hours from Henry VIII to a woman named Margaret Cole, who I believe, I'm not sure later, was beheaded.

17:05.065 --> 17:09.132
Well, Cole certainly was one of the archbishops of Canada.

17:09.152 --> 17:10.714
I mean, there was a Jewish family.

17:10.734 --> 17:12.717
Yeah, and this was a script.

17:13.861 --> 17:15.804
I'm holding it.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.488
That's really quite extraordinary.

17:19.549 --> 17:21.351
Well, we couldn't afford it today, I'm sure.

17:21.451 --> 17:23.934
You know, that's what most people say.

17:25.236 --> 17:27.319
Prices have gotten so high.

17:27.339 --> 17:34.628
And that's why, I mean, Mr. Scheide alone couldn't have done it today.

17:34.648 --> 17:37.432
I mean, he relies on his grandfather, in particular on his father.

17:38.233 --> 17:41.117
And that's why people collect

17:42.498 --> 17:44.540
kind of less broadly than practice.

17:44.560 --> 17:57.233
Or they, you know, they tend to collect, you know, not the original material, but, you know, not manuscript material, but first editions.

17:57.253 --> 18:02.258
Or they collect modern authors, assuming that a hundred years from now.

18:02.278 --> 18:04.000
Sure.

18:04.901 --> 18:08.184
Now, are you bitten by the collecting bug at all?

18:08.204 --> 18:08.425
No.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.728
I just seem to find that they're the professionals who work

18:12.603 --> 18:14.185
I can't understand this stuff.

18:14.465 --> 18:25.259
No, I mean, I am, in a sense, I mean, I want to acquire things for the Shady Library, but not for myself.

18:26.341 --> 18:34.772
I mean, I'm interested in books as historical objects, but in a sense, once I know about it, it doesn't make any difference to me where it is.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.855
Are you working actively in... Yeah.

18:37.115 --> 18:42.542
...perspective... Yeah, I mean, we just thought of...

18:43.163 --> 18:48.712
of an interesting manuscript in a book.

18:48.732 --> 18:53.820
Manuscripts that were written and then used as printer's copy.

18:53.840 --> 19:01.071
So we bought a copy of the book with the manuscript.

19:01.091 --> 19:08.243
There were about 15 of those.

19:08.263 --> 19:09.144
Yeah, I mean, it's great.

19:09.184 --> 19:11.027
That's the exciting thing.

19:11.260 --> 19:14.164
I mean, that's a whole new aspect of it.

19:16.027 --> 19:17.569
What is the portal name of this room?

19:17.589 --> 19:18.830
Does it have a portal name?

19:18.850 --> 19:20.533
No, it's called The Shady Library.

19:20.793 --> 19:25.560
It's called The Shady Library.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.223
Your access is from the library.

19:28.243 --> 19:34.572
And there's also that door there, which goes to the other side, so that I come in on the weekends and Saturdays.

19:34.892 --> 19:38.297
Because, of course, it's all alarmed, both there and there.

19:38.851 --> 19:40.613
It's very safe here, too, I would imagine.

19:40.653 --> 19:43.996
It is in a night wave.

19:44.016 --> 19:49.882
It's beautiful.

19:49.902 --> 19:56.468
And at a certain stage, it just gets too valuable or too important to keep in your home.

19:57.730 --> 20:01.654
And that's when you have to kind of move to an institution.

20:01.674 --> 20:03.235
Supposedly, that's what Jerome Kerns said.

20:04.176 --> 20:05.437
He said, we can't go out.

20:05.457 --> 20:08.200
We have to hire guards.

20:08.804 --> 20:12.009
I think he also knew that the crash was coming, too, wasn't he?

20:12.029 --> 20:13.751
He also sold all his stock.

20:13.771 --> 20:15.393
You know, John Craig had the big auction.

20:15.574 --> 20:20.320
I have a chapter that starts with the whole and ends with the current.

20:21.162 --> 20:38.406
The Golden Age started somewhat before that, but I'm able actually to bring, even though I'm starting in 1911, I'll have Morgan and Huntington and Folger and Widener and Rosenbach, all of this place, you know, at the current auction.

20:38.656 --> 20:39.598
The whole auction.

20:39.618 --> 20:40.359
The whole auction.

20:40.379 --> 20:41.542
The whole auction.

20:41.562 --> 20:43.646
That's really when Huntington became known.

20:43.666 --> 20:46.912
He really wasn't known as a collector until then.

20:46.932 --> 20:58.915
And those books by Leslie Morris, the two Rosenbach's exhibition, I just realized that, I mean, Rosenbach couldn't have existed without Huntington.

20:59.136 --> 20:59.196
No.

20:59.750 --> 21:07.421
If I buy all this, I could sell a third of it and recover more than my cost from Huntington, and the rest if I had to put in the stock.

21:07.882 --> 21:09.825
Well, Rosenblatt was kind of lucky.

21:09.885 --> 21:15.133
He had Huntington, and he also had Smith dying at an expectantly young age.

21:16.335 --> 21:18.558
I mean, because he basically, he actually, they have letters.

21:19.519 --> 21:28.052
He wrote people like Huntington, well, I'm awfully sorry about George D. Smith dying, but I'm here, and I'm certainly available to help you and to serve you.

21:28.825 --> 21:42.482
They're letting Wesley Morris, I've been to the Rosenbachs, and Fleming had a lot of correspondence up in New York that Ed Wolff didn't have access to, and he did his Rosenbach biography.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.363
Where is that now?

21:44.004 --> 21:46.627
At the Rosenbach Mall in Philadelphia.

21:47.268 --> 21:53.736
When Fleming acquired Rosenbach after they died, Philip and his brother,

21:54.965 --> 21:56.748
those files were with him in New York.

21:56.768 --> 22:03.078
Now since Fleming died just recently, like over the last two years, all that stuff came out of Philly.

22:03.098 --> 22:07.606
And there are some very interesting pieces of correspondence in there.

22:07.866 --> 22:17.462
But I mean, you know, just the way those two exhibitions talk about Rosenbach kind of motoring around, this last one motoring around England and Ireland.

22:17.982 --> 22:23.027
going in on the land of Jennifer, who he knew were in kind of financial difficulties.

22:23.047 --> 22:31.676
I think Leslie mentioned that a lot of that exhibit is basically stuff that they just did get from funding.

22:31.696 --> 22:33.998
And she actually has catalogued the whole way around.

22:34.018 --> 22:35.780
Yeah, I mean, they got a grant to do that.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.541
That's right.

22:37.622 --> 22:38.903
She and Ellen Dunlap.

22:38.963 --> 22:40.965
Yeah, they're part of it.

22:40.985 --> 22:41.866
Ellen was at Texas.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.150
Manuscripts in the 70s.

22:46.265 --> 22:48.287
strengths are in what areas would you say?

22:49.449 --> 22:52.773
Would be in biblical material.

22:52.813 --> 22:53.994
There's a kind of mixture.

22:54.014 --> 22:56.898
I mean, there are a number of books of ours.

22:58.219 --> 23:02.524
The books of ours, anybody who starts collecting medieval manuscript starts with books of ours.

23:02.645 --> 23:10.714
I mean, Christopher de Hamel has one kind of standard sale a year in December.

23:10.734 --> 23:13.778
90% of that is books of ours.

23:13.798 --> 23:15.580
Somebody like Bob Taylor, who had

23:16.319 --> 23:18.882
12 manuscripts.

23:18.902 --> 23:21.025
One of them was a book.

23:21.045 --> 23:26.752
Because they're visually appealing, and then the media is visually appealing.

23:26.772 --> 23:29.074
But you tend to move on into other things.

23:29.094 --> 23:32.198
So this is it.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.122
What are these little artifacts?

23:35.142 --> 23:37.324
Well, those were collected by his father.

23:37.425 --> 23:43.592
His father, I mean, you kind of branch out into other areas, and those are...

23:45.023 --> 23:51.669
things which demonstrate the history of writing.

23:54.232 --> 24:09.606
You have a number of, kind of, most rare book ones have non-book objects and they're kind of there because they're interesting.

24:09.626 --> 24:14.811
People, you know, I think if they're left over from the days in the library in the house

24:15.567 --> 24:19.913
If you want to have access, you go into the library after dinner.

24:20.053 --> 24:21.515
You look at a few things.

24:21.535 --> 24:24.539
After a while, people kind of glaze over when you bring out another book.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.964
But if you're the kind of object, it's related.

24:30.247 --> 24:32.230
The family that's now here in Princeton.

24:32.310 --> 24:34.854
Mr. and Mrs. Scheide, the children live.

24:35.034 --> 24:38.138
Well, they all live on the East Coast.

24:38.299 --> 24:41.984
One lives in Washington, outside Washington.

24:42.004 --> 24:42.925
One lives in Cambridge.

24:43.715 --> 24:50.221
Yeah, and isn't she going to Philadelphia, is married to someone who makes it to free that?

24:50.301 --> 24:51.643
Yeah, Gordon Marshall.

24:51.923 --> 25:05.396
Okay, well, I'm certainly talking with Mr. Scheide now, and this really extraordinary collection that you have here.

25:06.377 --> 25:09.460
And how does one start?

25:09.480 --> 25:10.161
I guess...

25:12.588 --> 25:15.391
There aren't many people who are really born to books, I guess.

25:16.052 --> 25:24.462
Maybe we could... This is a collection that's a legacy as much as it is a collection.

25:24.542 --> 25:25.663
You've seen the portraits on the wall.

25:25.843 --> 25:27.185
I've seen the portraits on the wall.

25:27.725 --> 25:36.375
And I just wonder... It has been said that books or book collecting is not something that's inherited.

25:36.436 --> 25:39.159
I wonder if you'd address yourself to that.

25:39.179 --> 25:40.300
I don't know.

25:41.225 --> 25:49.977
Maybe we could just start it there and then... I wouldn't have done it by myself, I guess.

25:51.018 --> 25:57.507
I wouldn't have taken a chance at what?

25:58.067 --> 25:59.910
Well, I wouldn't have done it by myself.

25:59.930 --> 26:03.555
I wouldn't have taken a chance at things being as they were.

26:04.836 --> 26:07.620
I guess what I'm interested in is

26:08.613 --> 26:17.608
From your earliest recollections must have been that books were very important and that the collection was a central element.

26:19.712 --> 26:31.251
I wonder if you could talk at all about how your collecting has differed from that of your father and how his collection differed from his father.

26:31.812 --> 26:34.637
What focus you brought to the collection?

26:35.174 --> 26:37.116
Well, mine's a very simple one.

26:37.237 --> 26:38.838
I got a little bit of music.

26:39.800 --> 26:49.211
But aside from that, I hated the collection more as the way it was, adding to the things that were already here.

26:49.231 --> 26:51.113
It's the same kind of thing.

26:51.133 --> 27:04.810
For example, standard manuscripts and American things, which are really important things that are already going strong in the Protestant.

27:05.549 --> 27:14.737
go back to my grandfather's events.

27:14.757 --> 27:20.823
So music would be really in a new direction, such as it is.

27:20.843 --> 27:28.269
I don't think it's a small section of the library.

27:28.289 --> 27:32.253
That's the most important autograph you can find out of your life.

27:32.273 --> 27:34.695
When we exhibit things, when we have a class,

27:35.047 --> 28:04.125
college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college college

28:04.493 --> 28:21.054
Bill was an old little English fellow, and so this binding was done at the Morgan Library about 30 or 35 years ago when it was assimilated.

28:21.074 --> 28:27.643
But it's the only Anglo-Saxon book in this hemisphere.

28:28.264 --> 28:28.904
Look at that.

28:29.325 --> 28:32.509
But if you come forward, it's easier to go to the table, really.

28:33.350 --> 28:42.959
No, is this something that you acquired, sir, or is this... My father, about 50 years ago.

28:43.479 --> 28:44.420
Better sit over here.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.202
Okay.

28:46.222 --> 28:46.562
Let's see.

28:47.363 --> 28:47.803
This better.

28:49.084 --> 28:51.606
Oh, my God, look at this.

28:52.187 --> 28:52.427
All right.

28:52.447 --> 29:01.095
Now, this is a bit of evil stuff, and it's set in the city of Lincoln for a number of centuries in the city hall.

29:01.902 --> 29:18.624
And Emmer Waterhouse signed it in several places, and the principal, Kilroy, who was here, was a fellow named George Davey, yes, Miesbauer, and this fellow here, 1607.

29:18.644 --> 29:25.573
He used to sit there and not have anything to do, and he had just signed the names in his book.

29:25.933 --> 29:26.574
There he is again.

29:27.215 --> 29:30.559
There's George Davey in 1604.

29:31.130 --> 29:33.473
Shakespeare probably writing King Lear or something.

29:33.934 --> 29:36.718
And he had anything better to do than that.

29:37.259 --> 29:42.407
And then here are a few pages from probably the New Testament.

29:42.907 --> 29:46.673
George Davie again, you see, he was very active in 1604.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.896
Flourished, shall we say.

29:50.519 --> 30:00.293
And these are a few pages from a few stories from the New Testament that somebody said, if you have that much of the Bible there, then

30:00.458 --> 30:08.545
the mayor and the sheriff and everybody else can lay their hands on it and say, I will have faith to execute this office, and swear to do so, and it'll take, it'll be okay, it'll be valid.

30:09.146 --> 30:10.207
It's called an Oath Gospels.

30:11.268 --> 30:11.408
Uh-huh.

30:11.428 --> 30:13.910
That's what it's called, the whole book, is that what you'd call it?

30:14.310 --> 30:14.791
I'm sorry.

30:14.811 --> 30:18.014
Well, those few pages are enough to make it an Oath Gospels.

30:18.174 --> 30:20.796
I get it.

30:20.816 --> 30:23.418
And the casuistry, then in fashion.

30:24.679 --> 30:25.320
There's this stuff.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.122
Is this a repair here?

30:27.142 --> 30:28.643
Yes, I think it is a repair.

30:29.045 --> 30:34.170
Then, after the Oath Gospels, there is some ordinances, medieval ordinances.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.654
One, I think about prohibiting pigs running around town.

30:38.695 --> 30:42.559
And my father was trying to find some of that stuff, I remember.

30:42.580 --> 30:44.882
And then you go right into the middle of the Anglo-Saxon.

30:45.763 --> 30:49.026
And it gets better, more distinct, quite quickly.

30:49.066 --> 30:51.589
But the margins are often quite full, like that one.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.512
Some of them are not, like that one.

30:54.813 --> 30:58.917
But the margins, when they have things in them, like they do there,

30:59.538 --> 31:04.502
are mostly officials of the city of Lincoln, England.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.225
So this is quite a valuable book for the history of that town.

31:09.486 --> 31:11.588
How old is it, would you say, sir?

31:11.608 --> 31:15.031
Well, it must be about a thousand years old now, I would think.

31:15.271 --> 31:15.952
And you think, Bill?

31:16.032 --> 31:19.175
Yeah, the Anglo-Faxon Corps has written about the year 1000.

31:20.616 --> 31:24.339
And it's a bunch of sermons and... A thousand-year-old book.

31:25.580 --> 31:26.761
English book.

31:27.121 --> 31:27.762
I really hate it.

31:27.782 --> 31:28.903
Proto-English.

31:29.187 --> 31:58.570
and um what is the material of the uh is that vellum yes but it's been rebound and there are bad things have happened to it and you can see uh up here like that you see just all you see are descenders and uh and there was a fellow working on this here some years ago who since died who um

31:58.972 --> 32:04.621
Some of these sermons where this happened, there were Latin texts known.

32:05.442 --> 32:16.639
So he would correlate this down here with the Latin, say, and he'd correlate that with the Latin, and he'd know what the Latin was for this line.

32:16.779 --> 32:17.841
Oh, I see.

32:17.861 --> 32:23.730
But then the problem would be to translate the Latin to that line into Anglo-Saxon with the descenders in the right places.

32:24.554 --> 32:25.655
That's an interesting problem.

32:25.675 --> 32:26.577
Yes, there certainly is.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.661
Which I do not find myself equipped to do.

32:29.861 --> 32:31.043
How much do you think was trimmed?

32:32.024 --> 32:32.605
One line.

32:32.665 --> 32:33.906
Let's settle for one line.

32:33.926 --> 32:34.968
Let's settle for one line.

32:35.428 --> 32:36.430
Yeah, I think that's enough.

32:37.391 --> 32:38.853
That's what he estimated, I think.

32:40.395 --> 32:43.920
See, when it was rebound, it wouldn't have, Morgan wouldn't have retrimmed it.

32:43.940 --> 32:45.762
No, it had been retrimmed earlier.

32:47.284 --> 32:51.009
See, and there's the fact, similar.

32:51.309 --> 32:53.312
And that's why it was disbound, so if they couldn't.

32:53.680 --> 32:58.407
It was a good come on.

33:00.850 --> 33:02.212
What do we want to show?

33:02.713 --> 33:05.657
We want to show there.

33:07.619 --> 33:07.980
I see.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.944
I don't know if it's Sir Winston S. Churchill.

33:11.685 --> 33:21.038
There was a series that was begun at the end of the Second World War when they realized that things could be lost.

33:21.271 --> 33:29.181
And, of course, this is already—it sneaked out in the 30s before they clamped down.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.765
Did you know how your father managed to acquire it?

33:33.326 --> 33:35.048
Yes, I know how he got it.

33:36.269 --> 33:45.220
The Earl of Lothian, Marcus of Lothian, sold it to a fellow named Cotland Bishop in 1932.

33:45.554 --> 33:47.917
And I thought I got it at the Cortland Bishop's Sale.

33:47.937 --> 33:49.739
I have the catalogs for the Bishop's Sale.

33:50.079 --> 33:50.860
So that'll be in there.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.202
It should be in there in 1938, about.

33:53.904 --> 33:54.765
Cortland Bishop's Sale.

33:54.885 --> 34:00.051
There are the Bwickling Homilies, and then the Bwickling Psalter is in the Morgan Library.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.653
But the Bwickling Psalter is in Latin.

34:02.053 --> 34:05.777
It's mainly a Latin book with Anglo-Saxon interpolations here and there.

34:05.797 --> 34:08.360
But this is a solid Anglo-Saxon book.

34:09.462 --> 34:15.088
And one passage in it that one scholar thought that it may have some relation to Beowulf,

34:15.912 --> 34:17.114
and so on.

34:17.154 --> 34:20.379
There are little biblical passages in it and on also.

34:20.699 --> 34:25.166
How often do you have occasion to enjoy it the way you're enjoying it now?

34:25.967 --> 34:26.748
Well, I feel like it.

34:26.988 --> 34:31.315
I'm more apt to catch the bug when someone else is around.

34:33.358 --> 34:34.399
Like yourself, for example.

34:34.439 --> 34:40.348
I'm so tired, to be honest with you.

34:40.388 --> 34:42.551
There's nothing much of this type of thing.

34:42.611 --> 34:45.295
It's as good as any page, I guess.

34:45.865 --> 34:48.349
What do you feel when you hold something like this?

34:48.369 --> 34:54.439
I feel very honored to be able to do so, that's all.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.545
It's a very unusual privilege, no question about that.

35:00.047 --> 35:09.062
I would have to say that that's as extraordinary a document as your Gutenberg Bible, maybe even in some respects more so.

35:09.082 --> 35:11.846
In some respects more so, especially in an English-speaking area.

35:13.048 --> 35:13.729
Yes, I think so.

35:14.603 --> 35:15.865
There's only one of these.

35:16.325 --> 35:17.787
That's the point.

35:17.807 --> 35:23.235
I mean, the Gutenberg Bible, as significant as it is... As Hans Krauss used to say when he didn't have it.

35:23.415 --> 35:26.759
It's a very common book.

35:26.779 --> 35:30.344
But when he had it, he says, I had the book of books.

35:30.364 --> 35:31.806
It depends on the point of view, you see.

35:32.767 --> 35:43.682
Edward Wolfe, who I interviewed a couple weeks ago, has described this as the finest, you know, we are, the three of us who are sitting among what he said, is without question the finest

35:44.303 --> 35:48.609
private library in the United States, and perhaps one of the finest in the world.

35:48.869 --> 35:51.473
Yeah, I would rank pretty good.

35:51.493 --> 35:56.319
In the United States, anyway.

35:56.380 --> 35:59.464
Edwin said without question, and he said to say hello.

35:59.844 --> 36:00.986
Oh, yes.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.688
A lovely man.

36:03.750 --> 36:04.350
He's a lot of fun.

36:04.370 --> 36:09.437
I'm sure he would encourage you and your researches.

36:09.477 --> 36:10.839
He's fascinating.

36:10.859 --> 36:12.842
He told me about the time he

36:13.430 --> 36:18.156
went out to Widener's house, and he said, boy, the times have changed.

36:18.176 --> 36:24.464
He said, I took the Gutenberg Bible and put it in the passenger's seat and drove it.

36:25.064 --> 36:26.907
Now as you create it, you insure it.

36:26.947 --> 36:29.410
It's all kinds of, I don't know.

36:30.752 --> 36:43.167
But I think to say that was kind of the beginning of a question, though, where, starting with a statement, this is said by any member of authorities to be the finest private library

36:43.433 --> 37:02.252
the united states and yet it's perhaps five thousand items and i think less less is it fewer than five thousand i used to think around three years i can't imagine i've added a thousand it's somewhere in there don't you think three or four yeah i mean i was never actually kind of depends it's always how you count the items you count

37:02.958 --> 37:30.265
know each one of the kings in an autograph so you can't say then that this is uh you know bibliomaniac oh no no in any way it's a very very focused and selective he's not um they used to call sir thomas phillips a velo maniac development no i'm not sir thomas neither of us none of us were uh yeah we'll show him the witness for it now uh there was a

37:30.751 --> 37:40.604
I think there was a Wycliffe New Testament in New York, but here there is something more important, namely the only Wycliffe Bible in this hemisphere, a complete one.

37:40.644 --> 37:45.731
And Belle de Costa Greene was very angry that her pal couldn't get it.

37:46.372 --> 37:53.421
Did you ever kind of go head-to-head with B.G., as they call her?

37:53.721 --> 37:54.422
Well, I knew her.

37:55.584 --> 37:56.465
My father knew her better.

37:56.905 --> 37:59.709
He took me to see her.

37:59.789 --> 38:00.370
He says this.

38:01.109 --> 38:17.627
That Bible I found in my dear father, Sir Will Morley's study, which book I believe was his great-grandfather, Mr. T. Morley, M. Darby, Mary, the Countess of Darby, 1717, and that's when she found that.

38:17.647 --> 38:22.292
Then somebody here in the Elizabethan Times said, look at this, this is the Bible complete in English.

38:22.853 --> 38:27.758
And then another fellow, this is my wife's book, T. Palmer.

38:28.379 --> 38:32.864
and he was about 1730s, and he's probably the fellow who had this binding put on.

38:33.826 --> 38:57.154
Now, there was a Norwegian lady here some years ago who was working on this prologue, and she was a Middle English scholar from the University of Trondheim, and a big friend of the librarian here at the time, Anna Bryan, and she had chosen this copy as a source for

38:57.623 --> 38:59.365
working on the preface.

38:59.445 --> 39:01.487
And the preface is a funny preface.

39:01.988 --> 39:03.409
The author swears, even.

39:03.890 --> 39:10.016
He says, some place here now, wait a minute, there.

39:10.036 --> 39:18.065
He mentions how the Bible had been translated into Latin and how dangerous it was and how nasty he was thought of being for translated into English.

39:18.806 --> 39:27.495
And he says, Lord God, that at the beginning of faith so many men translated into Latin, the great prophet of Latin men,

39:28.083 --> 39:35.514
Let one simple creature of God translate into English for the benefit of Englishmen.

39:36.376 --> 39:37.157
So on and so on.

39:37.517 --> 39:50.277
You know what impresses me, not only what you're reading to me, but the fact that every book, every item here, you've been able to open almost like the magician deals as cards.

39:50.527 --> 39:52.830
You know precisely what page you want to read to me.

39:52.850 --> 39:53.991
Well, that's right at the end of it.

39:54.011 --> 40:00.498
Yeah, but I mean, you know, what I'm saying is, this is a, you are a collector who knows this collection.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.482
You have a card catalog over there, but you never use it.

40:05.103 --> 40:05.684
Only now and then.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.407
Only now and then.

40:08.447 --> 40:14.393
I mean, is it fair to say that you know this collection thoroughly, that not only what is here?

40:14.414 --> 40:17.917
I know several books in it, but there are plenty that I can learn about.

40:17.937 --> 40:18.878
That's all right.

40:18.898 --> 40:20.280
There's something I can learn about.

40:20.547 --> 40:24.754
What book don't I know about?

40:24.774 --> 40:29.060
It's just easier when you're here to talk about those that I don't.

40:29.221 --> 40:31.384
It's more fun.

40:32.285 --> 40:35.971
Now here's, for example, the family that own this book.

40:37.213 --> 40:42.041
And let the record show we've jumped to the very end of this very large-sized book here.

40:42.201 --> 40:43.683
Well, it isn't very large-sized.

40:43.723 --> 40:45.486
It's large enough to be a Bible.

40:45.546 --> 40:48.090
It's large enough to be a Bible.

40:48.442 --> 40:55.750
if the hearer of these words has ever heard of the word Bible, the family of Mary and the family of Boyer.

40:56.712 --> 41:06.283
And here our dear friend Nicholas Barker contributed a grain of useful, interesting information.

41:06.803 --> 41:10.688
He said, you know, I go to the public record office and go to a lot of doctors.

41:10.708 --> 41:13.010
I'll keep an eye out for this name, Mary.

41:13.371 --> 41:13.731
And he did.

41:14.072 --> 41:17.976
And he found a reference to a fellow named Mary

41:18.530 --> 41:24.597
who was gone to legal trouble in the late 14th century for such thing to burn down a monastery.

41:25.298 --> 41:26.799
So he'd be a Lollard, you see.

41:28.822 --> 41:30.904
Well, is that an unusual surname?

41:32.305 --> 41:32.726
I don't know.

41:33.026 --> 41:40.395
But that fellow was a Lollard, and this is a Lollard book, and it's owned by a family named Mary.

41:40.855 --> 41:44.159
And that's how it was spelling Mary, M-A-R-Y, right?

41:44.179 --> 41:47.102
Yeah, and that was the same way in that public record office thing.

41:47.707 --> 41:49.829
That's about, look at this, 1586.

41:49.849 --> 41:59.040
And the book came in this family, and a married daughter married a guy named Thomas, in the Boyer family, so it goes over here, so you get the Boyers.

42:00.121 --> 42:17.460
And then it says here, in, talk about the book, and in Bloody Mary's time, he says, oh yeah, in those superstitious times, can you see it down there, superstitious times?

42:17.862 --> 42:25.953
was kept in hugger-mugger, which is a word that Claudius uses in Hamlet to talk about Colonius's body.

42:26.013 --> 42:28.356
He did him wrong in hugger-mugger to incur him.

42:29.077 --> 42:32.082
And there it's written in the contemporary of Shakespeare.

42:32.863 --> 42:35.346
It was kept in hugger-mugger.

42:35.446 --> 42:37.369
Look that up in my concordance to Shakespeare.

42:37.809 --> 42:38.590
Look it up in Hamlet.

42:38.971 --> 42:41.915
That's H-U-G-G-E-R, right?

42:41.955 --> 42:42.556
Hugger-mugger.

42:42.616 --> 42:43.397
Hugger-mugger, yes.

42:43.850 --> 42:48.536
That's probably one of the words that credits Shakespeare with inventing, and he probably didn't.

42:53.023 --> 42:59.171
It's in that scene around Act IV or so, where Laertes comes back and tries to start a rebellion.

42:59.251 --> 43:00.513
Remember that scene, more or less?

43:01.174 --> 43:03.137
And what's his name?

43:03.217 --> 43:06.241
Claudius and his wife, or queen, are talking about it.

43:07.062 --> 43:07.463
Gertrude.

43:07.763 --> 43:09.145
Yeah.

43:09.165 --> 43:12.810
They're talking about it, and there's a remark that he makes to her in that dialogue.

43:13.583 --> 43:15.065
So there it is.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.146
Hugger-mugger.

43:16.486 --> 43:17.087
Yeah, hugger-mugger.

43:17.888 --> 43:22.853
But now he's going to, he's going to, now he resolves to keep this book and so forth.

43:22.873 --> 43:26.016
And then he goes on and has a great time about Queen Elizabeth here.

43:26.036 --> 43:28.980
It's a small thing.

43:29.000 --> 43:41.413
Yeah, Lady, Queen, and all, and all die before the sorrowful days of England shall come if God should take her.

43:42.659 --> 43:45.403
take her from us, I think, before the end of the world.

43:47.145 --> 44:09.477
And if for our sins she should die, I suppose, I can't remember all these words, but whether something of God, that I pray God or something, that he will grant me the grace to die at her feet before her.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.635
That's what this guy wants to do.

44:14.217 --> 44:15.519
She's going to die sometime.

44:15.539 --> 44:16.920
He wants to die at her feet before.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.682
Actually, she'd be a little bit surprised.

44:20.565 --> 44:22.367
Die at her feet before.

44:22.407 --> 44:29.375
And the last days, well, anyway, he put an everlasting life.

44:29.435 --> 44:30.837
Amen, amen.

44:31.137 --> 44:32.699
He's in a great state.

44:32.819 --> 44:37.084
I just think a scholar would find some very interesting material in there about

44:38.110 --> 44:39.573
temporary life.

44:39.593 --> 44:40.034
Sure.

44:40.695 --> 44:42.920
It's one of the important books.

44:44.242 --> 44:55.344
I mean, there's a whole, there was a kind of myth going, that Lollards were kind of an underground group, and therefore the manuscripts which they produced therefore ought to be kind of homemade products.

44:55.525 --> 44:55.845
I see.

44:55.906 --> 44:57.148
Well, you just look at that,

44:58.107 --> 44:59.930
And you know that isn't a homemade product.

45:00.010 --> 45:01.131
That, for sure.

45:02.093 --> 45:06.298
Well, it's no really fancy one, but it's an incredible job.

45:06.358 --> 45:07.160
It's an incredible job.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.122
And they all look the same.

45:09.283 --> 45:13.248
I mean, all kind of... Some of them are pretty fibery.

45:13.268 --> 45:15.111
They're very much fancier ones.

45:15.151 --> 45:15.892
Not much, though.

45:15.952 --> 45:16.833
Oh, yes.

45:16.853 --> 45:18.455
It's a much bigger book.

45:18.515 --> 45:19.196
Look at those.

45:19.236 --> 45:21.339
Those are almost illuminations there, aren't they?

45:21.860 --> 45:25.465
The Kenworth.

45:26.255 --> 45:30.239
I saw the show yesterday at the Morgan, by the way, on the Dutch manuscripts.

45:30.259 --> 45:31.260
Imaginary, lovely.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.120
It's quite beautiful.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.844
The Times has been doing it this week until Sunday.

45:35.904 --> 45:37.225
They're going to do it on Sunday?

45:37.265 --> 45:38.106
Yeah.

45:38.126 --> 45:40.788
All right, I'll have an eye for it.

45:40.808 --> 45:42.049
We'll go up and take a look next week.

45:42.329 --> 45:43.971
It's really quite wonderful.

45:44.632 --> 45:46.393
Yeah, these letters.

45:46.413 --> 45:47.714
Some of these Sauter ones.

45:48.555 --> 45:50.817
These are the Psalms, you see, the Sauter, he says.

45:50.857 --> 45:52.318
This is something your father acquired?

45:52.359 --> 45:52.719
Yeah.

45:53.179 --> 45:56.262
How old were you when you became aware of the contents of this book?

45:56.798 --> 46:00.444
Oh, I remember more as when it came, I guess, in 1931.

46:02.247 --> 46:06.134
Did you always share the same enthusiasm for the books that your father did?

46:06.154 --> 46:08.618
No, he sort of took them for granted.

46:08.938 --> 46:12.785
I mean, but at what point did you realize that this was a generational legacy?

46:12.845 --> 46:17.373
I mean, it was almost a responsibility to this extraordinary collection.

46:18.134 --> 46:21.199
Yeah, it was part of the atmosphere I grew up in.

46:22.261 --> 46:23.042
I knew nothing about that.

46:24.743 --> 46:29.629
There's, for example, the Competentian Polyglot up there.

46:29.649 --> 46:33.975
It isn't everybody that has that right under his playroom.

46:34.055 --> 46:35.878
Now, which did we say that was?

46:35.898 --> 46:37.239
Competentian Polyglot?

46:37.860 --> 46:42.386
Oh, that's a—think of Steve Wiseman, who runs Simony's bookshop.

46:42.706 --> 46:44.689
That's the fellow that published his thing.

46:44.789 --> 46:45.230
Okay.

46:45.991 --> 46:53.080
And—I mean, you remember— You don't have to get it out, but— You remember the books coming to the house.

46:53.347 --> 46:54.568
Well, I don't remember that book.

46:54.629 --> 46:56.771
No, but I remember this book.

46:56.791 --> 47:00.195
I remember the Gutenberg Bible, Big Bucks, by Dr. Rosenbach.

47:00.676 --> 47:01.036
Really?

47:01.096 --> 47:02.658
Earlier in 1924.

47:06.342 --> 47:08.725
Well, there you get an idea.

47:08.745 --> 47:09.846
But that is a unique one.

47:09.866 --> 47:11.428
You can't see that anywhere else in this country.

47:11.869 --> 47:21.480
Speaking of Rosenbach, when I was talking to Ed Wolff, I never thought I'd hear him say that he actually thought that when it came to knowledge of books that Klaus was just

47:21.747 --> 47:24.510
superior to Rosenbach in terms of knowledge of books.

47:24.851 --> 47:26.012
And this is both.

47:26.072 --> 47:30.377
Rosenbach, on the other hand, was more of a friend, you know, more of a hardy good fellow.

47:30.597 --> 47:37.065
He said when it actually came to knowledge of books, I wonder if you'd have any thoughts on either of those two.

47:37.105 --> 47:49.459
Well, Ed would have known Rosenbach very much better than I. I only saw him very occasionally as a boy or a young person and worked with him and was educated by him.

47:50.063 --> 47:55.768
I couldn't believe it, but I certainly couldn't argue with that point.

47:55.828 --> 48:00.633
It's very interesting you never said that.

48:00.653 --> 48:02.174
Well, Hanson will get mixed up now and then.

48:04.436 --> 48:09.301
Show me the thing we want to have a facsimile of.

48:11.663 --> 48:13.945
And this is a really interesting story.

48:14.826 --> 48:16.948
And if we can ever get

48:17.587 --> 48:20.711
and Hope Mayo to do the job.

48:21.452 --> 48:39.697
And now this is, there is a, there is a, um, this is a papal bull printed in Mainz in probably late 1456, and this is a Latin copy.

48:40.759 --> 48:46.767
There is a German copy of it, and printed in the same type, probably about the same time, in Berlin.

48:47.590 --> 48:53.199
But this is the only printed version, contemporary printed version, in Latin, you see.

48:54.101 --> 48:59.149
And this is the earlier Gutenberg type, the 36-line size.

48:59.991 --> 49:05.119
And there's probably more 36-line type in this room than there is anywhere else in this country.

49:06.862 --> 49:08.144
And most of it's here.

49:08.204 --> 49:09.647
Well, the 42 is first, right?

49:09.887 --> 49:11.590
You need to do the 42 and then...

49:11.890 --> 49:12.330
Well.

49:12.871 --> 49:14.553
We don't know that.

49:14.573 --> 49:14.793
Okay.

49:14.853 --> 49:16.935
The 42 was used for the first big book.

49:17.195 --> 49:18.056
Okay.

49:18.076 --> 49:18.857
First, first book.

49:18.917 --> 49:19.878
Which comes first, though?

49:19.898 --> 49:22.481
This, the other, the 42 comes first, right?

49:22.501 --> 49:22.661
No?

49:24.343 --> 49:28.287
Before the, for the, the, the Bible, there's a prehistory.

49:28.507 --> 49:29.488
It's speculated.

49:30.109 --> 49:31.810
My guess is that this is earlier.

49:31.830 --> 49:38.217
That this is on the, on the road to, um, they kept reducing the size, I think.

49:40.079 --> 49:40.159
Hmm.

49:40.628 --> 49:47.776
It does stretch credulity to think that printing emerges full-blown with the 42-line Bible.

49:47.796 --> 49:50.619
That's too much for me.

49:50.859 --> 49:56.666
And this type, now there are all kinds of funny pieces of type here.

49:56.686 --> 49:58.688
Let me see if I can find one of my favorite pieces.

49:58.708 --> 49:59.909
It's beautiful though, isn't it?

49:59.929 --> 50:01.130
Well, there's some nice letters in here.

50:01.791 --> 50:08.138
Where's he, when he talks, look at that, look at that tree there, how that's well-eat.

50:08.793 --> 50:13.317
That boy we're talking about, actually, instead of tree, right?

50:13.337 --> 50:15.279
Look at the bell ringing, you see.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.581
Isn't that wonderful?

50:17.601 --> 50:19.863
Una campana sonorosa.

50:21.805 --> 50:26.469
The Pope wants bells ringing very sonorously.

50:26.489 --> 50:27.290
What do we call this?

50:27.991 --> 50:29.352
Calixtus Bull, we'll call it.

50:29.993 --> 50:31.914
What's the Pope calling this?

50:32.435 --> 50:33.296
Bull on a turk, see.

50:33.376 --> 50:34.116
Bull on a turk, see.

50:34.136 --> 50:36.619
There comes Calixtus, a bishop.

50:36.819 --> 50:38.040
C-A-L-I.

50:38.830 --> 50:43.556
Well, he spells it there with an S. It's sometimes spelled with an X. Either will pass.

50:43.576 --> 50:43.776
Okay.

50:44.197 --> 50:45.098
We want to be accurate.

50:45.478 --> 50:45.779
Yes.

50:46.179 --> 50:49.183
Now, this is something, again, that your father... Yes, yes.

50:50.044 --> 50:55.471
And Mr. Krause has had various attitudes about this book.

50:55.491 --> 50:58.435
You see there, it's been taken out of something.

50:58.635 --> 50:59.216
Can you see that?

51:01.458 --> 51:08.247
And my father got it in 39, and...

51:08.868 --> 51:12.836
I talked to Krause about this, and he knew about the sale.

51:13.577 --> 51:15.260
It was a sale in Prague, I think.

51:16.683 --> 51:21.793
I forget the name of the nobleman who was having no more at that time.

51:22.534 --> 51:27.484
But Krause said, oh, one time he said,

51:27.886 --> 51:29.528
Oh, I was a young fellow.

51:29.588 --> 51:32.090
I didn't know anything.

51:32.110 --> 51:34.112
I had this bread in my possession.

51:34.272 --> 51:36.034
I didn't know what I had.

51:36.094 --> 51:37.535
He's crying a little bit, right?

51:37.836 --> 51:38.396
Oh, yes.

51:38.416 --> 51:43.661
Another time, he didn't admit that and didn't think it was he at all.

51:44.162 --> 51:50.127
But somebody took it from there and got it to Mag somehow or other, and my father could never get to the bottom of it.

51:50.307 --> 51:51.208
Is that completed?

51:51.649 --> 51:51.949
Yes.

51:52.069 --> 51:53.531
That's not a leaf or anything?

51:53.611 --> 51:55.092
No, see, there's an end of it.

51:55.578 --> 51:56.680
There's the beginning of it.

51:56.700 --> 51:57.240
There's the end of it.

51:57.260 --> 51:57.921
So how many pages?

51:59.484 --> 52:02.428
Well, I numbered them one time as 10A, 10B.

52:02.608 --> 52:06.354
So there would be 20 pages, rather small pages.

52:06.374 --> 52:09.558
And I'm trying to find a particular page.

52:11.501 --> 52:13.324
You can tell particular pieces of type.

52:13.805 --> 52:24.420
This U, for example, has a gap in a certain place, and another U that has it in a different injury in another place.

52:25.177 --> 52:29.161
And that's my favorite—well, I guess this is the place.

52:29.181 --> 52:37.289
There's a—and that T, that was a—that crops up lots of places.

52:37.750 --> 52:40.072
That almost looks like it's been filled in, doesn't it?

52:40.612 --> 52:40.833
Where?

52:40.853 --> 52:41.173
I wonder.

52:41.814 --> 52:42.895
What's been filled in?

52:42.915 --> 52:47.399
It doesn't, but I mean, it looks like maybe they went over it, or do you think— No, it's bad inking there.

52:47.419 --> 52:48.060
It's bad inking there.

52:48.520 --> 52:48.781
Yeah.

52:49.141 --> 52:50.162
But you see—look at this.

52:50.182 --> 52:52.244
You see the watermark right there without any trouble at all.

52:52.264 --> 52:52.644
Indeed.

52:53.005 --> 52:54.306
Great impression.

52:54.539 --> 53:00.085
Now here, you see there's a T with a very wide crossbar.

53:01.127 --> 53:03.129
Very different than that T there, for example.

53:03.850 --> 53:04.731
Very narrow crossbar.

53:05.131 --> 53:07.154
Has there been a study of the type made?

53:07.214 --> 53:09.877
Is it Kusenberg's type?

53:09.977 --> 53:10.317
Oh, no, no.

53:10.357 --> 53:12.420
Paul Needham's been over every single letter in this.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.503
This O is also unique, I think, to this room.

53:16.044 --> 53:17.285
There's a hole down there.

53:18.727 --> 53:19.148
Wow!

53:19.648 --> 53:20.890
I'm going to write that one down.

53:20.930 --> 53:22.892
Well, I don't know.

53:23.513 --> 53:25.017
I said the Anglo-Saxon also.

53:25.057 --> 53:25.559
Yeah.

53:26.622 --> 53:28.327
Well, there may be another one of it.

53:28.407 --> 53:30.533
That might be the title of this chapter, by the way.

53:30.554 --> 53:30.754
Yes.

53:32.620 --> 53:35.548
I'm just trying to speak a little bit.
