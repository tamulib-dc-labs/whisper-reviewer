WEBVTT

00:04.165 --> 00:07.490
Okay, tuck in a check.

00:07.650 --> 00:07.750
Okay.

00:09.172 --> 00:09.893
It's there.

00:10.514 --> 00:12.296
I'll forget it's there in a minute or two.

00:12.657 --> 00:17.243
But my sister lives in the apartment upstairs, and she works out in Attleboro.

00:17.263 --> 00:19.046
So I get down here this morning.

00:19.086 --> 00:19.907
I brave the weather.

00:19.927 --> 00:20.928
Get down here this morning.

00:21.629 --> 00:23.813
She comes down and says, I'm stuck in the middle of the road.

00:23.853 --> 00:26.256
So I spend the first hour of the day shoveling her out.

00:26.496 --> 00:28.139
Now, you're a disability business?

00:28.419 --> 00:29.400
Yeah.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.303
And a disability insurance business?

00:32.144 --> 00:37.049
Yeah, my father started the business the year I was born, I guess, 59.

00:37.069 --> 00:41.334
And... Tell me what the math makes you, what?

00:41.354 --> 00:41.934
36.

00:42.254 --> 00:44.116
Just turned 36 on Christmas Day.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.239
And I came in here.

00:46.259 --> 00:47.740
Christmas Day is your birthday?

00:47.760 --> 00:47.860
Yeah.

00:47.880 --> 00:48.081
Obviously.

00:48.101 --> 00:49.222
Christmas, baby.

00:51.024 --> 00:52.085
I was the 24th.

00:52.565 --> 00:52.906
Oh, yeah?

00:53.726 --> 00:54.607
Just missed it.

00:54.948 --> 00:55.648
Oh, boy.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.650
So you get to put them in the morning.

00:57.671 --> 00:59.032
Yeah.

00:59.052 --> 00:59.673
Knock wood.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.373
We'll take it.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.054
Yeah.

01:01.338 --> 01:02.760
You're a Worcester guy, obviously.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.502
Absolutely, yeah.

01:04.682 --> 01:06.665
This is part of the story, I guess.

01:06.685 --> 01:09.448
You basically spent your whole life here, is that right?

01:09.969 --> 01:11.852
I haven't gotten out.

01:12.613 --> 01:21.824
Not only a Worcester guy, but the shame of it, Mick, is that I was born and grew up on June Street, less than a half a mile from here.

01:22.525 --> 01:25.569
What's the name of that neighborhood?

01:25.649 --> 01:29.534
Newton Square area is usually what I say when I'm trying to direct someone there.

01:29.554 --> 01:29.995
But...

01:30.262 --> 01:33.467
Born on June Street and lived there for 21 years.

01:34.388 --> 01:39.215
Went to school right here at Blessed Sacrament at the corner of Park and Pleasant.

01:41.918 --> 01:46.625
Then I went for four years and went up to Holy Cross, which was the farthest I've ever gone, really, for the most part.

01:46.645 --> 01:53.715
Of course, that's the great goal of every... Yeah, really, right?

01:55.398 --> 01:57.180
I didn't go far, that's for sure.

01:57.481 --> 02:00.205
So that's probably a mile from where you were born.

02:00.325 --> 02:01.427
Yeah, exactly.

02:01.647 --> 02:04.452
And then... Did you always want to go to Holy Cross?

02:04.472 --> 02:08.157
I mean, were you tempted to maybe try Boston College and really explore?

02:08.177 --> 02:09.039
You know what?

02:10.040 --> 02:18.954
I never, you know, I wasn't, I was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a voracious academic, you know?

02:19.014 --> 02:26.205
I wasn't, until, you know, my parents put the gun to my head my senior year in high school and said, hey, you've got to go to school somewhere.

02:26.590 --> 02:33.519
And the reality of, you know, the only jobs I'd had till then was I was always a dishwasher at a restaurant, you know.

02:34.059 --> 02:40.707
So the idea was, you know, well, geez, if I don't go to some school, I'm going to be washing dishes somewhere.

02:41.308 --> 02:43.090
So I end up at Holy Cross for four years.

02:43.551 --> 02:47.135
And then when I got married, I got married a year after I got out of school.

02:48.077 --> 02:51.261
My wife and I moved over to Longfellow Road, which is about two blocks from here.

02:51.561 --> 02:55.686
So I always say for 36 years, my whole life's been circumscribed in about a two-mile

02:56.172 --> 03:19.260
square area you know when did you graduate holy cross i got out of uh holy cross in 81 yeah and your wife so what's the girl she's from lowell actually i'm from lowell are you really oh my god you probably know all the same people well what's your what's your name well her maiden name was nancy murphy yeah and uh don't forget i graduated lowell high school in 61 so i've been

03:19.679 --> 03:20.400
Jeez.

03:20.420 --> 03:20.861
Out of there.

03:20.901 --> 03:25.888
Well, as you can see from the poster behind you, you can see the Lowell connection.

03:26.069 --> 03:26.830
There you go, right?

03:26.850 --> 03:32.739
I didn't realize that it was that, you know, that... That was our meeting point.

03:32.839 --> 03:36.444
I was a, you know, as a teenager, I was a big Kerouac fanatic.

03:36.464 --> 03:36.825
No kidding.

03:37.085 --> 03:41.552
And so I met Nance, like, the first week, you know, we were in college.

03:41.572 --> 03:42.613
She went to Holy Cross?

03:42.634 --> 03:43.976
She went to Holy Cross from Lowell.

03:44.797 --> 03:48.302
And we got to talking, you know, one of the first things she says is, I'm from Lowell, you know.

03:48.653 --> 03:51.016
Oh, my God, Jack Kerouac was from Lowell.

03:51.036 --> 03:56.081
And she says, you know, very proudly, she says, oh, his grave is across the street from my parents' house.

03:56.262 --> 03:58.584
Her parents bought a cemetery, you know.

03:58.724 --> 04:01.207
So I said, you met him?

04:01.648 --> 04:02.188
Oh, of course.

04:02.268 --> 04:03.209
You know, when wasn't he?

04:03.269 --> 04:03.790
Of course.

04:03.890 --> 04:07.114
But, oh, my God, you could lay claim to.

04:07.194 --> 04:10.357
Once you told him you were from Lowell, you must have been golden with him.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.679
Or it didn't connect at all.

04:12.740 --> 04:13.581
He was mooching.

04:14.202 --> 04:16.245
I mean, it was really kind of sad.

04:16.345 --> 04:19.289
It was really sad.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.712
But anyway.

04:22.213 --> 04:24.016
Those last years and all the biographies.

04:24.036 --> 04:25.898
Not a memorable encounter.

04:25.918 --> 04:27.521
No, not one to write about.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.443
But anyway, go ahead.

04:29.483 --> 04:31.927
I like these freewheeling things, though.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.809
That was how we met.

04:33.829 --> 04:37.114
That was the initiating point of our first conversation.

04:37.154 --> 04:39.778
We stayed up all night long talking about Kerouac.

04:40.398 --> 04:41.600
Were you a literature major?

04:41.981 --> 04:43.703
Yeah, I was an English major.

04:44.392 --> 04:50.000
You know, I thought, the whole thing for me was that, you know, I was just a born reader.

04:50.481 --> 04:53.125
I was just, there were a lot of books in our house.

04:53.145 --> 05:00.035
You know, I grew up in a big two-and-a-half family, you know, and extended family lived with us, you know.

05:00.075 --> 05:01.217
I thought it was the three-decker.

05:01.698 --> 05:02.419
Close to it.

05:02.739 --> 05:04.622
It wasn't the full third floor, you know.

05:04.902 --> 05:11.412
I'm thinking of a story that I can fashion for outside the region, too, you know.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.354
You can call it a three-decker.

05:13.474 --> 05:17.138
It's a full three levels, but the top floor isn't a full apartment.

05:17.158 --> 05:23.765
But, you know, my grandparents and I lived on the first floor, and we lived on the top two floors.

05:23.985 --> 05:28.170
And in the top floor, you know, there were five of us, five kids.

05:28.670 --> 05:34.456
And so the top floor, my parents just sort of made a big, you know, loft area to get us out of the hair.

05:34.476 --> 05:40.723
And what my father did was he took one end of the room and he just made, you know, all bookshelves.

05:41.362 --> 05:47.307
And then they took, you know, a lifetime's worth of all my grandparents' books and my aunt's books, my mother's books, my father's books.

05:48.168 --> 05:56.216
Well, they had books, but they were all, you know, everything from, you know, chemistry texts from 1930 to... Did your parents go to school?

05:56.236 --> 05:58.037
Did your father go to college?

05:58.197 --> 06:00.519
My father went to Holy Cross.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.921
My mother was... Second generation?

06:01.961 --> 06:03.242
You might even be... Third, actually.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.603
My grandfather went also.

06:04.723 --> 06:05.764
Yeah, yeah.

06:05.784 --> 06:07.286
My grandfather was class of 13.

06:07.306 --> 06:09.528
So your grandfather was class of 13.

06:09.668 --> 06:09.968
Yeah.

06:10.387 --> 06:11.708
But they weren't, you know, it's funny.

06:11.748 --> 06:13.210
They were all... My father was class of what?

06:13.610 --> 06:14.892
My father was class of 50.

06:15.312 --> 06:16.273
And I was... Is he Jim?

06:16.453 --> 06:16.974
He was Jim.

06:17.154 --> 06:18.315
And your grandfather was who?

06:18.456 --> 06:20.137
My grandfather was my namesake, actually.

06:20.177 --> 06:21.339
He was John.

06:21.559 --> 06:22.440
Yeah, yeah.

06:22.460 --> 06:22.700
Jack.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.521
Both of us were Jack.

06:24.202 --> 06:33.371
But the funny thing was, and extending down to me, you know, I say, I mean, people sort of sneer at it, but they were still all, you know, working class Irish.

06:33.872 --> 06:36.274
We all ended up at Holy Cross kind of by accident, you know?

06:36.615 --> 06:37.376
I don't believe it.

06:37.396 --> 06:37.716
I know.

06:37.796 --> 06:39.718
And everybody says that, and yet...

06:39.918 --> 06:44.025
My grandfather, he got out of Holy Cross, and what does he do?

06:44.105 --> 06:46.689
He becomes a 30-year registry cop.

06:46.709 --> 06:50.876
You know, he never went on, never did anything with a degree.

06:51.497 --> 06:55.644
And my father, you know, it was an accident of the G.I.

06:55.664 --> 06:56.365
Bill, basically.

06:56.385 --> 06:58.348
He grew up on Oread Street, you know.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.773
He was destined for God knows what.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.718
Well, he didn't just go because he had the GI Bill.

07:03.778 --> 07:06.803
I mean, he clearly was motivated to go to college.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.927
Well, I think it was the milieu.

07:09.588 --> 07:10.309
He came back.

07:10.590 --> 07:11.892
He was in the Navy for four years.

07:11.932 --> 07:18.523
He came back from the war, and all his contemporaries, all his peers were taking advantage of it.

07:18.543 --> 07:20.806
They were all going back to school, so he went down.

07:20.826 --> 07:21.788
The red light is on, right?

07:22.325 --> 07:23.386
The red light is on.

07:23.487 --> 07:23.867
Is it on?

07:23.947 --> 07:25.069
There's a little red light, yeah.

07:25.089 --> 07:26.190
And, yeah, it's fine.

07:26.230 --> 07:26.611
Is it working?

07:26.631 --> 07:27.211
Yeah, it's fine.

07:27.292 --> 07:28.633
And the little thing is twirling, right?

07:28.653 --> 07:29.174
It's moving.

07:30.135 --> 07:30.776
With sake.

07:31.617 --> 07:36.223
I mean, I just have to... Have you ever had an incident where you end up with a blank tape?

07:36.243 --> 07:42.191
No, never with a blank tape, but I have had a tape that's going down function on there.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.055
I usually carry two tape refers.

07:45.075 --> 07:47.799
I do, too, and I, you know, this is a nice one.

07:47.839 --> 07:51.323
I keep one in the car, you know, and I just put notes down.

07:51.344 --> 07:51.724
I always tell them.

07:52.447 --> 07:54.870
Anyway, let's go back.

07:54.890 --> 07:57.534
Get off the tape recorder.

07:58.756 --> 08:02.461
So I grew up in a big, you know, three-decker full of these books.

08:02.701 --> 08:05.044
And my mother was a real, she was the real reader.

08:05.205 --> 08:10.372
My mother would just, you know, she was a, she loved books from childhood.

08:10.853 --> 08:16.260
And she became a registered nurse, and she always seemed to work night shifts.

08:16.713 --> 08:21.861
And so she always would say, you know, I always had a flashlight, you know, where she'd be doing private duty, you know.

08:22.162 --> 08:22.823
Fiction, obviously.

08:22.843 --> 08:23.704
Yeah, fiction.

08:23.725 --> 08:24.947
Yeah, she'd read anything, you know.

08:25.007 --> 08:26.970
She was just voracious.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.753
And I got it from her, you know, I swear.

08:28.813 --> 08:32.860
And I just grew up, you know, my world was books, you know.

08:33.260 --> 08:41.674
And yet, you know, going to parochial schools, there wasn't a tremendous amount of, you know, discipline was the key word more than math.

08:42.160 --> 09:12.117
stoking the imagination you know memorize the baltimore catechism more than you know enjoy shakespeare so my so that you know i wasn't really steered in any direction my my uh reading aesthetic was formed by what was ever in the uh black wire spin racks at the local rexall you know literally that we had a rexall on the corner of june street the corner of june street and chandler and that you know i we always had jobs and chores you know growing up and whenever i'd save

09:12.822 --> 09:17.749
You know, at the time it was like, it had moved up from 60 cents to 75 cents for a paperback.

09:18.089 --> 09:21.574
And I'd go down and I'd, you know... Always fiction, always novels?

09:21.934 --> 09:23.416
Always, almost always novels.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.860
Occasionally writers' biographies, you know.

09:25.980 --> 09:28.944
I remember reading Jack London's biography, you know, at a young age.

09:31.548 --> 09:33.170
How big, how large is your family?

09:33.190 --> 09:33.731
How many kids?

09:33.751 --> 09:34.251
Five kids.

09:35.753 --> 09:36.474
I'm the middle kid.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.857
Two older sisters, younger brother, younger sister.

09:40.039 --> 09:40.720
And...

09:41.611 --> 09:46.177
on the heels of becoming a real reader.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.801
And they always seemed naturally meshed to me.

09:48.861 --> 09:51.645
I just started scribbling in notebooks.

09:51.725 --> 09:55.651
I mean, did you always know that you were coming into the family business?

09:56.111 --> 09:56.632
Not at all.

09:57.233 --> 09:57.814
Not at all.

10:00.778 --> 10:02.380
Everything's been so haphazard.

10:02.500 --> 10:11.112
I had the kind of gall that only a tremendously unaware young person can have that, you know,

10:12.020 --> 10:18.107
I'd just keep filling notebooks up, and eventually I'd, you know, I'd end up a writer somehow, sooner or later, you know.

10:18.727 --> 10:29.459
And I could never, it was really, about once a year every fall I teach this high school writing program, you know, high school kids around, actually from now it's from all over New England.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.504
And I always say, you know, these kids seem so much more sophisticated than I ever was.

10:34.704 --> 10:41.672
You know, at that age, it's just, my idea literally was if I could ever meet

10:42.158 --> 10:44.642
you know, a living, breathing, real writer, you know.

10:45.082 --> 10:48.107
And I had 15 minutes to ask them the top 10 questions.

10:48.167 --> 10:49.789
I had the questions framed out in my mind.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.954
The questions, and they were the most literal, meat-fisted questions.

10:52.974 --> 10:56.339
They were, you know, do you write with a typewriter or a pencil?

10:56.639 --> 10:58.682
You know, if it's a typewriter, is it a Smith-Corona?

10:58.743 --> 11:01.326
If it's a pencil, is it a... Exactly, you know.

11:01.447 --> 11:05.112
And the idea, literally, it sounds so hysterical now, the idea was...

11:05.345 --> 11:11.031
I figured if I could emulate all those answers, you know, then the magic would happen and it would work for me.

11:11.111 --> 11:13.394
I remember my mother likes to tell the story.

11:13.414 --> 11:17.378
I always was meant to be a writer when I was five, four.

11:17.618 --> 11:18.980
I said, what are you doing?

11:19.000 --> 11:19.640
I'm writing a book.

11:19.660 --> 11:22.083
Well, I was copying the Iliad, you know.

11:22.423 --> 11:22.964
Perfect.

11:23.404 --> 11:24.846
It doesn't get any better than that.

11:24.866 --> 11:25.767
You were.

11:26.287 --> 11:28.530
That's how you write a book.

11:28.550 --> 11:28.770
All right.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.270
But I picked a good book.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.913
You picked the right one.

11:32.933 --> 11:35.937
It's a good metaphor for how the process happens, too, you know.

11:36.077 --> 11:37.539
That's all there is to it.

11:37.559 --> 11:38.701
That's all there is.

11:39.402 --> 11:45.269
I have notebooks still, you know, crammed in desk drawers at home dating back to when I was seven, eight years old, you know.

11:46.231 --> 11:57.726
And really pretty pristine memories of sitting at my, you know, grandmother's dining room table getting away from everybody, you know, trying to find the quiet corner somewhere in the house and just making stories.

11:57.746 --> 11:57.846
Sure.

11:58.012 --> 11:59.414
Well, now let's jump ahead.

11:59.474 --> 12:01.597
Now, you entered a contest, right?

12:01.617 --> 12:03.660
This is how you... I won a contest.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.145
I didn't even know there was a contest, and I didn't know I was entered.

12:07.165 --> 12:08.707
I'm a little vague on the history on this.

12:08.727 --> 12:24.468
Yeah, what happened was I was writing... After I got out of college, I was writing a lot of short fiction, you know, and just sending it out, getting it back, just mechanical, a ton of rejections, just continual, you know.

12:24.789 --> 12:25.690
What kinds of pieces?

12:26.260 --> 12:29.104
Oh, bad Raymond Carver invitations, mainly.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.169
So, basically, you were trying to do detective things, mystery things.

12:32.289 --> 12:32.810
Not at all.

12:33.571 --> 12:35.594
No, I was doing, you know, Raymond Carver.

12:35.614 --> 12:36.435
Raymond Carver, yeah.

12:36.616 --> 12:38.338
Oh, you're thinking Chandler.

12:38.899 --> 12:41.383
I was, no, I didn't read mysteries.

12:41.663 --> 12:43.446
I didn't read crime fiction.

12:44.788 --> 12:50.817
Yeah, I was basically... Yeah, I was basically doing...

12:51.117 --> 13:07.513
imitations of what was in the air at the time in the mid-80s, you know, which was basically the, you know, minimalist slash new realist, you know, all those, you know, Tobias Wolfe, Elizabeth Talent, all those short story writers at the time.

13:08.174 --> 13:12.318
And getting a lot, sending them all out to the quarterlies, getting them all back, you know.

13:12.719 --> 13:15.862
But by that time... Have you looked at any of them since?

13:16.562 --> 13:17.403
Oh, yeah.

13:18.044 --> 13:21.107
They're dreadful.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.121
You were serving your apprentice.

13:23.141 --> 13:23.402
Right.

13:23.502 --> 13:24.723
No one will ever see them.

13:24.883 --> 13:25.944
They're dead and buried.

13:25.964 --> 13:27.205
They're where they belong.

13:27.345 --> 13:28.426
Right, absolutely.

13:28.806 --> 13:32.449
All the critical judgments that were made on those stories were correct.

13:32.469 --> 13:33.951
Okay, go ahead.

13:33.971 --> 13:34.911
So we turned to where you were.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.153
Well, two things happened at the same time.

13:37.333 --> 13:42.358
One was that the stories were bloating.

13:42.378 --> 13:44.099
You know, they were just getting longer and longer.

13:44.680 --> 13:50.925
And there was a guy, there's a poet named Robert Cording, who teaches English up at Holy Cross.

13:51.361 --> 13:53.504
and I had gotten to know him fairly well as a student.

13:53.884 --> 13:59.392
And then after I graduated, we continued to sort of see each other, and he'd look at my work continually.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.674
He was a real mentor, you know.

14:00.714 --> 14:04.639
He sort of, if anyone taught me how to write, he did, absolutely.

14:04.919 --> 14:06.441
Now you're married, are you working here?

14:07.162 --> 14:08.064
Yeah, yeah.

14:08.084 --> 14:10.106
So did you basically come right into the business?

14:10.126 --> 14:16.575
Yeah, what happened was, I went through four years of college, pretty much diluted that, you know,

14:17.045 --> 14:23.732
the way I'll become a writer is, you know, the summer after I graduate, I'll write that first novel, it'll be published, and there's the career, you know?

14:24.252 --> 14:30.239
And of course, the summer came along, I didn't write the novel, and, you know, I need a job, you know?

14:30.679 --> 14:32.461
Just as well, you didn't write the novel straight away.

14:32.481 --> 14:33.002
Exactly.

14:33.402 --> 14:38.067
So I looked for some teaching jobs, and things just sort of fell into place.

14:38.287 --> 14:45.094
I ended up coming in here, and I got married right after that, and that was when I kind of got

14:45.395 --> 15:14.828
serious about it you know I had a full-time job and I said I gotta make some sacrifices or I'm gonna not be writing for the first time in my life so that's when I started the habit of getting up at 5 4 35 o'clock in the morning knocking off a few hours of writing before coming into work so it was really schizophrenic at the beginning you know it was did you ever have any doubt that you wouldn't I mean every day yeah I continue I you know I say I had doubt what I had was um

15:15.027 --> 15:17.610
I had no indication that I'd ever break through.

15:18.511 --> 15:22.676
But I did know that whether I ever broke through or not, I'd always be doing this.

15:22.996 --> 15:26.440
Because not to do what I was... Yeah, it was... Not to do what?

15:27.402 --> 15:29.124
I wasn't a pleasant person to be around.

15:29.264 --> 15:34.230
You know, I mean, my wife can always tell if I've slipped and missed the morning or something.

15:34.250 --> 15:41.338
As a matter of fact, kind of an apocryphal story, what happened was, when we got married in 82...

15:41.943 --> 15:46.088
And we moved into a little cottage, and we were sort of renovating it, you know.

15:46.128 --> 15:46.829
In Worcester?

15:46.849 --> 15:47.991
Yeah, right around the corner.

15:48.231 --> 15:49.873
Same place we continue to live now.

15:50.154 --> 15:52.757
No, no, too terrifying.

15:53.618 --> 16:00.847
And there was a little room above the garage that we had sort of said in passing, that'll be a study, you know, when we get it together.

16:01.428 --> 16:05.213
But for about six months, you know, I was just recently married.

16:05.774 --> 16:08.457
I was only a year into, you know, this job.

16:08.943 --> 16:11.947
And we were working on the house, and we didn't get the room together.

16:12.408 --> 16:19.999
And it was the first time since I was literally seven or eight years old that I wasn't continually writing, you know, every day.

16:21.201 --> 16:27.090
And I was getting more and more just disgruntled and, you know, a lot of anxiety, a lot of depression.

16:27.751 --> 16:35.482
And finally one morning, I'm sound asleep in bed, you know, it's like February.

16:35.502 --> 16:37.245
It's a morning like this, freezing cold.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.585
The alarm goes off.

16:38.605 --> 16:40.086
It's pitch dark at 5 a.m.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.029
You know, I sit bolt upright.

16:43.049 --> 16:44.190
I said, what's going on?

16:44.211 --> 16:44.811
My wife says.

16:45.572 --> 16:45.912
Get up.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.013
Go to the room.

16:47.073 --> 16:47.954
Pushes me out of bed.

16:48.455 --> 16:55.802
And I go down, and what she had done was she had, you know, whitewashed all the walls in this room, put all the bookcases in, put all my books in it.

16:56.162 --> 16:57.043
We had a desk in there.

16:57.063 --> 16:59.205
She pulled the drop cloth off, set up the typewriter.

17:00.347 --> 17:05.552
And that morning I sat there, you know, for two hours, and I might have written a sentence or two, you know.

17:05.572 --> 17:05.832
People don't.

17:06.335 --> 17:07.156
I appreciate it.

17:07.336 --> 17:09.158
It's not a tap you can just turn on.

17:09.219 --> 17:09.699
No way.

17:10.080 --> 17:17.048
And this stuff comes... But from that day, from that day, that was the routine that started.

17:17.068 --> 17:17.789
This is about when?

17:18.169 --> 17:19.832
That began in 1982.

17:20.192 --> 17:28.522
And then what ended up happening was, so I was writing these short stories every morning, and what ended up happening was, as I say, it was twofold.

17:29.443 --> 17:35.751
One thing that happened was the stories were getting longer and longer and longer, and I didn't have, you know, I'm the worst...

17:36.845 --> 17:38.127
inner critic.

17:38.147 --> 17:42.976
I just have no capacity for judging my own work at all, none.

17:43.858 --> 17:45.681
I desperately need outside readers.

17:46.362 --> 18:00.287
So one thing that happened was Bob Cording, my mentor, his name is C-O-R-D-I-N-G, and he's published three volumes of poetry, and he literally had to say to me one day, you know, and I handed him a

18:00.487 --> 18:26.427
short story that was 160 pages long he had to say you know maybe you're not writing short stories anymore maybe you're starting to write novels you know and it was literally like an epiphany it was well maybe maybe i'm finally doing it you know so um the second thing that happened at about that exact same time was that a story a very small story that i had sent out to um

18:27.605 --> 18:32.731
New England Review, Red Love Quarterly, which at the time was being edited by Sidney Lee.

18:34.693 --> 18:35.334
They accepted it.

18:36.796 --> 18:39.859
That classic day, the envelope came back in the mail.

18:39.879 --> 18:42.782
Instead of having the story, it had an acceptance.

18:42.803 --> 18:45.466
And that was in 86.

18:46.407 --> 18:48.649
In the summer of 86, the story came out.

18:49.490 --> 18:51.112
What was the name of it?

18:51.132 --> 18:52.333
It was called Nevada.

18:52.934 --> 18:55.397
I was about to say Nebraska.

18:55.417 --> 18:56.278
I got my states wrong.

18:56.765 --> 18:57.947
Think of the Springsteen album.

18:58.247 --> 18:59.249
No, it was called Nevada.

18:59.649 --> 19:02.314
And, you know, the story comes out.

19:02.574 --> 19:03.375
It's in the quarterly.

19:03.816 --> 19:04.397
You read it.

19:04.537 --> 19:06.160
It's nice, and you forget about it, you know.

19:06.680 --> 19:22.485
Except that about a month later, I got a letter in the mail from an agent in New York City, and he said, you know, I read this story you wrote, and he said, have you written a novel I might read?

19:23.022 --> 19:33.338
And so immediately I ran to the typewriter and just lied my ass off, you know, I just, yeah, I'm just finishing up, you know, finishing up my first novel and I expect to have it to you in about three months.

19:34.559 --> 19:51.645
And classic first novel story, you know, I just threw everything, you know, I threw 26 years worth of, you know, experience and reading and stuff into it, you know, everything but the kitchen sink and then the kitchen sink, you know, and

19:52.199 --> 19:56.904
And the three months, and I literally figured, you know, I'm constantly self-deluded.

19:56.924 --> 20:06.013
I literally figured I would take three months, and I just, you know, I would do nothing but, you know, eat, sleep, and write.

20:06.233 --> 20:07.034
That was exciting.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.295
Do you know who the agent was?

20:08.555 --> 20:10.037
Yeah, he's my agent today.

20:10.097 --> 20:11.318
It's Nat Sobel.

20:12.299 --> 20:13.019
S-O-B-E-L.

20:13.039 --> 20:13.800
S-O-B-E-L.

20:13.820 --> 20:17.464
He's, who are some of his, James Elroy.

20:17.484 --> 20:17.824
Oh, really?

20:17.904 --> 20:20.687
He represents Elroy, James Hall.

20:20.988 --> 20:22.310
Back from Florida, yeah.

20:22.811 --> 20:29.882
Andrew Greeley, he represents... I think Thorne's getting a little old for me.

20:29.902 --> 20:31.685
Time to start something new.

20:31.705 --> 20:33.908
The last adventure was a little crazy.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.292
But that's just... Yeah, you get bogged down.

20:36.312 --> 20:38.255
The first couple were really outstanding.

20:38.315 --> 20:40.839
Travelable Freeze.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.684
And Elroy's had quite a run, too.

20:43.724 --> 20:45.206
This year, especially.

20:45.266 --> 20:47.510
He's still trying to figure out where the hell he's going, I think.

20:47.530 --> 20:47.670
And...

20:48.697 --> 20:52.361
He's an interesting guy.

20:52.782 --> 20:53.903
I remember.

20:53.963 --> 20:55.665
I think I'm sure I clipped that article.

20:55.785 --> 20:56.666
It's in my files.

20:57.227 --> 20:58.809
He's always working on the mother's story.

20:58.829 --> 21:01.952
Yeah, he's doing the autobiography, so to speak.

21:01.972 --> 21:04.095
The investigation, so to speak.

21:04.115 --> 21:04.595
But go ahead.

21:04.615 --> 21:05.837
So, Sobel.

21:05.937 --> 21:17.590
Yeah, so Nat sent me a letter, and I literally believed, you know, I had an idea for a novel, for a first novel, and I literally believed that I could write it in three or four months.

21:17.924 --> 21:19.407
and then get it back in the mail to him.

21:20.309 --> 21:26.523
And of course, you know, like every first novel, it's the three months turned into, literally, it turned into three years.

21:26.644 --> 21:27.606
No kidding.

21:27.626 --> 21:34.361
Yeah, and I figured it'd be like a 200-pager, you know, first novel off the desk, and it turned into a 600-page novel.

21:35.123 --> 21:37.468
And I had to, it was embarrassing, because I had to...

21:38.157 --> 21:49.853
write back to him three years later and say, remember me, you sent me this solicitation and enclosed a photocopy of his original letter and say at the end of it, you know, would you be interested?

21:51.055 --> 21:54.780
You didn't consider maintaining contact with him?

21:54.800 --> 21:55.801
Were you embarrassed?

21:55.821 --> 22:00.547
Yeah, I was, you know, I had fibbed to begin with, you know, I was afraid of coming clean.

22:01.409 --> 22:03.632
And, you know, he was great.

22:03.752 --> 22:06.636
He was just so encouraging.

22:06.656 --> 22:07.557
You know, he wrote back,

22:07.756 --> 22:10.699
And he was always encouraging and honest at the same time.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.222
You know, he never let me believe, you know.

22:13.243 --> 22:14.945
Do you remember what year this was about?

22:14.965 --> 22:19.710
This was, by the time it was done, I started the book January 1 of 86.

22:20.591 --> 22:21.672
And I didn't finish it.

22:21.753 --> 22:23.014
26 years old.

22:23.034 --> 22:24.436
Yeah, 26 years old.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.420
And I didn't finish it until the very end of 88.

22:30.543 --> 22:32.245
And in the meantime...

22:32.866 --> 22:35.970
You know, everything, my whole life had sort of, they'd been huge upheaval.

22:35.990 --> 22:39.695
My father passed away suddenly, and there was a lot of changes.

22:40.235 --> 22:50.208
And, as a matter of fact, I had to, what happened with the book was I had to suspend work on it after my father's death for a little bit, and then plunge back into it and try to pick up all the pieces.

22:50.969 --> 22:55.735
And it was a really different book, you know.

22:56.542 --> 23:03.491
When I wrote back to Matt and said, would you read it, he wrote back, he said, 600 pages, send me the first 50.

23:04.672 --> 23:06.755
Which, you know, pretty standard, and I did.

23:07.316 --> 23:10.400
And he wrote back and he said, all right, send me the other 550.

23:10.460 --> 23:18.270
But he said, this is the least commercial book I've ever attempted to represent.

23:18.290 --> 23:20.693
It had no commercial sales potential at all.

23:20.713 --> 23:23.376
There was no way to sit down across the desk from an editor and say,

23:23.693 --> 23:25.556
This is a genre work, boom, boom.

23:25.616 --> 23:27.999
This is your, you know, market audience, boom, boom, boom.

23:28.280 --> 23:32.666
It was a... To this day, it's hard to describe it.

23:32.686 --> 23:33.247
You know what it was?

23:33.888 --> 23:48.009
It was my attempt, my inept attempt to try to write, you know, a big modernist Joyce-ian novel, you know, and it was just, it was nuts.

23:48.089 --> 23:48.790
It was...

23:49.445 --> 23:58.919
It was set, it was in the prototype version of Quinsigamond, you know, it was my extrapolated version of Worcester, and it took place in a week.

23:58.939 --> 24:05.329
It took place during Holy Week of Easter, and each chapter was a day, you know, it was the seven days of the week.

24:06.010 --> 24:15.604
And what I would do was, the whole book, you know, it just had this ridiculous, Joyce-ian kind of structure to it, where what I would do would be, I would take every

24:15.922 --> 24:28.536
you know, referent of the number seven that I could find, you know, the seven deadly sins and the seven primary colors and the seven wonders of the world, and they each had a specific place in the novel they had to repeat, you know.

24:28.556 --> 24:44.393
And what it was about, basically the plot line was, it was about this transmogrified version of Holy Cross, you know, that's on this hill, and it's about a senile, possibly insane, alcoholic,

24:44.997 --> 24:59.815
elderly Jesuit who at midnight every day of Holy Week, uh, leaves the hill in a Rolls Royce that's chauffeur driven by an 18 year old local, you know, blue collar kid.

25:01.257 --> 25:07.945
And they drive down the hill and visit all these different places until dawn, you know, the following morning.

25:09.287 --> 25:11.469
And in the course of the night, you know, they go to different places.

25:11.489 --> 25:14.413
They always end up every, every, every, at the end of every, um,

25:15.203 --> 25:43.033
night as dawn comes they always end up at a different diner in the city which was the most fun part about writing writing the book was like i picked seven different diners and then i'd spend months you know just drinking gallons of coffee and sketching the diner and stuff and uh yeah that's the boulevard my wife took that picture yeah so uh yeah she did a good job on that yeah i actually loved the time myself very nice and

25:43.216 --> 25:44.918
Oh, she'll be pleased to hear so.

25:44.938 --> 25:47.402
I thought you bought it, actually.

25:47.522 --> 25:48.183
It's nice.

25:48.203 --> 25:49.845
Well, they won't market it out there.

25:49.865 --> 25:51.427
Yeah, it's got the grid, you know?

25:51.467 --> 25:55.172
It's got the icicles hanging in there, the slant of the post.

25:55.373 --> 25:56.674
The lines are good.

25:57.055 --> 25:57.295
Go ahead.

25:57.315 --> 25:58.217
I'm sorry.

25:58.237 --> 26:00.820
By the way, how many kids do you have?

26:00.840 --> 26:02.903
How many kids do I have?

26:03.123 --> 26:03.964
I have two.

26:04.565 --> 26:09.212
My three-year-old is Claire, and I have a seven-month-old, James.

26:10.313 --> 26:12.396
So are you...

26:12.595 --> 26:14.938
Writing the business, though, since your brother died?

26:14.958 --> 26:15.159
Yeah.

26:15.179 --> 26:16.861
Well, my wife and I both, we jointly are.

26:17.302 --> 26:18.804
She came in after my father passed away.

26:18.824 --> 26:24.092
She was a school psychologist, and she left that and came in here, and we'd been here ever since.

26:24.112 --> 26:27.517
That was almost nine years ago.

26:27.537 --> 26:29.760
I hope not.

26:29.780 --> 26:30.541
Oh, it's still turning.

26:30.821 --> 26:32.063
Oh, it's the heat.

26:32.183 --> 26:34.467
It's the steam behind you.

26:34.487 --> 26:36.570
But anyway, I'm digressing way too much here.

26:37.651 --> 26:38.873
You can pick and choose it.

26:39.713 --> 27:05.434
But I said, so when Matt read the novel, you know, and he said, he wrote me back, he read the whole thing, and he said, he wrote me back a really nice letter that I've kept, but he said, I have no idea, you know, if I can sell this, which, oh yeah, which I subsequently found out was kind of amazing, because, you know, he's only making money on whatever he sells, and his time is, in that profession, his time is absolutely money.

27:05.554 --> 27:06.936
Exactly, exactly.

27:07.372 --> 27:10.596
And he, you know, for two years, he flogged that thing.

27:10.837 --> 27:13.340
He just, he went out, we went to... That's pretty decent.

27:13.720 --> 27:14.321
Oh, God.

27:14.441 --> 27:16.504
That's why, you know, I'm just so indebted to this guy.

27:16.524 --> 27:21.631
But we, in the end, by the end, I think we'd gone to something like 20 different houses with it.

27:22.492 --> 27:35.910
And we came... At three or four different houses, we came, you know, very close to actually getting a sale at... Where does Jonathan Galeshi...

27:36.143 --> 27:37.685
Is Faresdrasch Kuro?

27:37.725 --> 27:39.908
Yeah, Faresdrasch.

27:39.989 --> 27:40.629
Gillespie, Gillespie.

27:40.649 --> 27:42.132
Gillespie, I can never remember.

27:43.854 --> 27:44.996
We came close there.

27:45.016 --> 27:51.545
He loved the book, but he just felt, you know, he can't, he's not going to sell five copies of this thing, you know.

27:52.507 --> 27:54.910
I think publishing the first book is the hardest thing in the world.

27:54.930 --> 27:57.874
You know, it's absolutely unknown commodity.

27:57.974 --> 27:59.316
I recommend it to no one.

27:59.336 --> 28:00.298
Right, yeah.

28:00.318 --> 28:01.820
It's the most wonderful thing in the world.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.202
When it happens, God.

28:03.703 --> 28:03.923
Yeah, yeah.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.475
So the agent just flogged the thing.

28:06.635 --> 28:07.717
You know, it was funny.

28:07.818 --> 28:19.600
It was a funny experience, and it was a good experience to go through because I went through all his emotions that I always assume, and I know from talking to other writers, you know, first novelists go through, which was he'd send

28:19.951 --> 28:22.974
He'd forward an editorial letter from, say, Random House, you know.

28:24.475 --> 28:25.476
I'd just hold on to it.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.217
You know, I'd be like, look at the great things.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.320
You know, I'd say, oh, we love the prose and we love the characters.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.142
And then you'd hit the last paragraph and it would go.

28:32.662 --> 28:33.443
But it doesn't fit our list.

28:33.523 --> 28:36.266
Yeah, there's no way, you know, we're going to make any money on this book.

28:36.906 --> 28:40.189
And, you know, I'd be showing these to my wife going, look at what.

28:40.209 --> 28:42.791
First novels never make any money anyway.

28:43.132 --> 28:43.832
Yeah.

28:44.213 --> 28:47.556
You know, the whole idea is grab them now for the future.

28:47.576 --> 28:49.097
We hope three books down the line.

28:49.364 --> 28:55.273
So obviously you had to make a fundamental decision here to switch gears and to try something a little more commercial.

28:55.934 --> 28:56.615
Yes and no.

28:56.975 --> 29:01.402
What ended up happening was, at first I thought that's exactly what the mistake was.

29:01.462 --> 29:10.055
The mistake was that it wasn't commercial enough, so therefore if I just blatantly went the commercial route, I'd have no problem.

29:12.739 --> 29:18.628
So I wrote back to Matt and I said, give me three months and I'll have in your hands a saleable novel.

29:19.081 --> 29:20.083
So I sat down.

29:20.203 --> 29:20.824
Three months again.

29:21.605 --> 29:21.985
Three months.

29:22.005 --> 29:23.508
I must be hung up on three months somehow.

29:24.008 --> 29:29.036
But this was one of the most important lessons I learned in the past 15 years or so.

29:29.236 --> 29:31.720
I literally, in three months, I ripped something off.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.443
You know, I just, boom.

29:33.463 --> 29:40.213
I wrote a sleek, filed-down, 250-page crime thriller.

29:40.233 --> 29:41.856
250 manuscript pages?

29:41.876 --> 29:43.037
250 manuscript pages.

29:43.138 --> 29:46.503
So what's that from 140, 150 pages?

29:46.523 --> 29:46.883
Probably.

29:46.923 --> 29:47.765
Something that's tight.

29:47.785 --> 29:48.025
Yeah.

29:48.342 --> 29:50.083
That was what I wanted, yeah, really tight.

29:50.784 --> 29:56.389
And my idea was, you know, this is exactly what they're looking for, you know.

29:56.469 --> 30:00.512
It has sex, it has violence, it's stripped down, you know, the reader can just, you know.

30:01.533 --> 30:07.378
And I sent it to the agent, almost cocky that this would, you know, click.

30:07.398 --> 30:14.924
And in three weeks, boom, it's back in my door with a really terse note from him saying, don't send me anything like this ever again.

30:15.425 --> 30:17.927
And I just, I'd made a fatal mistake, which was, you know,

30:18.667 --> 30:22.570
I just, there was no interior vision in that book at all.

30:22.610 --> 30:24.132
You can't fool his people.

30:24.152 --> 30:24.272
Yeah.

30:24.332 --> 30:27.775
My idea, you know, it was like writing with my eyes closed.

30:27.815 --> 30:31.238
It was, you know, it was really horrid, basically.

30:31.278 --> 30:37.463
I was like... Well, my buddy, you know, remember Everett Skane used to write... Yeah, I read his first, I think it's first.

30:37.483 --> 30:38.124
Bullet for Georgie.

30:38.144 --> 30:39.585
Bullet for Georgie, that's the one, yeah.

30:39.625 --> 30:44.269
He went up to Maine and he tried to do some stuff.

30:44.289 --> 30:47.712
I remember my editor, you know, and...

30:48.367 --> 30:55.175
He's batting this shit out.

30:55.616 --> 30:57.999
Doesn't he realize that he's not fooling anybody?

30:58.239 --> 30:59.681
And this is a published author.

31:00.242 --> 31:00.642
You can't.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.504
You have to care about it.

31:02.945 --> 31:07.411
These are professional people, and they can see exactly what it is.

31:07.711 --> 31:09.413
You know, it sounds.

31:09.798 --> 31:37.662
absolutely sounds so cliched but as soon as the passion isn't there you know as soon as you just it isn't coming from in here so he was he was a little angry yeah yeah he felt after that first book which was my time with this he felt the first book was so obsessional yeah and that that was the value to it you know that that that like everything interior is coming out on the page and and that is what's eventually going to sell you and that i had just completely you know negated that in the second book

31:38.047 --> 31:39.609
So here I am now at this point.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.291
I'm 29 now.

31:43.114 --> 31:48.942
What I'm figuring is I sacrificed the only agent who ever had an interest in me.

31:49.603 --> 31:58.755
And what ended up happening, and at that point I was really starting to doubt things because at that point I didn't have any ideas for a third book, too.

31:58.895 --> 32:00.858
And the prospects were zero.

32:00.878 --> 32:01.879
And the prospects were zero.

32:01.899 --> 32:03.902
I was just creatively barren, you know.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.472
and brooding about it a lot.

32:06.672 --> 32:09.695
Things in the works, at least the hope wasn't there.

32:09.715 --> 32:11.797
You didn't have a book making the rounds at some point.

32:11.817 --> 32:12.357
No, nothing.

32:12.377 --> 32:13.138
There was nothing.

32:13.318 --> 32:14.980
The first book was a trunk novel.

32:15.020 --> 32:15.400
It was dead.

32:15.440 --> 32:19.404
The second book... If something's making the rounds, at least, it's hope.

32:19.504 --> 32:23.147
The call could come tomorrow, as unlikely as that might be.

32:24.368 --> 32:26.751
You want to take a break, and I'll get you coffee?

32:26.771 --> 32:30.634
I'd love a coffee.

32:30.674 --> 32:31.135
Great.

32:31.595 --> 32:32.556
You said black, right?

32:33.110 --> 33:00.720
oh god you're not gonna have any coffee i had a couple already and i keep to the quota but uh what ended up happening was so here it was this was summer of 89 i guess july of 89 and i got two dead novels i've angered my agent and i've got no ideas for anything new you know it's starting to seem like is he encouraging you to do anything else he didn't you know

33:01.527 --> 33:15.429
In the letter that returned the second book, it was about three sentences long, and there was no P.S., send me the next book, which was, you know, I was saying, boy, this guy's clearly spent a lot of time on my behalf with no return.

33:16.311 --> 33:28.210
So what ended up happening was, and I've told this story, you know, a few times before because it's just characteristic of how every book since then has come to me.

33:29.540 --> 33:36.129
We went out to dinner for my wife's birthday at the, I guess it's closed now, the Victorian down in Whitensville.

33:37.411 --> 33:39.154
Out of business now, somebody told me recently.

33:39.334 --> 33:41.637
Very, very nice.

33:41.657 --> 33:42.819
Yeah, it was a great place.

33:42.919 --> 33:45.122
I reviewed restaurants years ago.

33:45.142 --> 33:46.444
Oh, it was a nice job.

33:47.205 --> 33:48.467
Good work if you can get it.

33:48.487 --> 33:49.949
Well, I got food poisoning a couple of times.

33:49.969 --> 33:51.271
Oh, no, you're kidding me.

33:51.291 --> 33:52.572
I got so bored with it.

33:53.033 --> 33:53.854
Oh, my God.

33:53.914 --> 33:54.956
Really?

33:56.658 --> 33:57.740
You never think of it like that.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.462
Just feeling that you have to go out.

34:00.404 --> 34:04.668
to dinner, and you have to be so critical of every damn thing that comes across.

34:04.688 --> 34:07.251
Actually, when you say that, it took the pleasure out of it.

34:07.411 --> 34:11.555
I think to myself, you can never really kick back and say, well, let's enjoy the night.

34:11.575 --> 34:15.579
But anyway, so it took the joy out of going out to dinner.

34:15.599 --> 34:17.241
Jeez, that's a shame.

34:17.501 --> 34:18.282
Not really.

34:18.302 --> 34:19.823
It's back.

34:19.843 --> 34:20.704
It didn't stay away.

34:20.764 --> 34:22.266
No.

34:22.286 --> 34:25.669
Well, so we were at the Victorian, and we had, you know,

34:26.172 --> 34:32.277
Here I am for weeks on end brooding about what am I going to do for a new book, and am I going to be able to... Oh, good.

34:32.397 --> 34:32.778
I'm glad.

34:33.578 --> 34:36.601
Am I going to be able to mend fences with my agent and everything?

34:36.841 --> 34:47.150
And so what ended up happening was I had a really nice meal, and for a minute I sort of forgot about the whole writing problem.

34:47.731 --> 34:51.134
And we finished our meal, and we were driving up 1.46.

34:51.334 --> 34:56.078
It was probably about midnight, and there were no other cars on the road.

34:56.497 --> 35:05.126
until finally, somewhere between Whitensville and Lister, you know, two big lights come up behind me and then swing out and pass me, and it's a huge U.S.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.488
Postal Service van, you know, U.S.

35:07.508 --> 35:08.729
Postal on the side with the eagle.

35:09.670 --> 35:18.759
And as it passes, my wife makes the remark, she says, did I ever tell you what happened to me one night when I was sorting mail during college?

35:19.580 --> 35:24.265
When she was at Holy Cross, to earn money, she worked as a night sorter at the Lowell Post Office.

35:25.025 --> 35:25.626
So...

35:25.960 --> 35:28.483
I said, I don't remember a story like that.

35:29.244 --> 35:52.575
So she proceeds to tell me how one night, you know, she's sitting there at 2 in the morning or something, and she's in front of, you know, they call them cages, the big green metal slotted stations, and a box about the size of this donut box comes across her cage, you know, and it's wrapped in brown paper, and there's no return address, and she knows there's something wrong with it right away because...

35:53.399 --> 35:59.468
You know, there's seepage coming from, it's all wet in the bottom, and there's a foul smell coming from the thing.

36:00.209 --> 36:00.790
So what do you do?

36:00.850 --> 36:01.852
You tell the supervisor.

36:01.872 --> 36:05.617
So she goes, gets the supervisor, comes back, he says, I think we have to open this one.

36:05.637 --> 36:06.519
There's something wrong here.

36:06.699 --> 36:08.061
And they have the right to do that.

36:08.081 --> 36:11.827
Yeah, if there's suspicion about, you know, a package, they can check into it.

36:12.408 --> 36:20.740
So they get the X-Acto knife, they cut it open, fold back the tissue paper, and there's a dead bat inside the package.

36:21.530 --> 36:27.257
So she's telling me this on 146 as I'm driving, and as I hear, inside the package is a dead bat.

36:29.059 --> 36:37.349
I just want to pull to the side of the road, you know, get out the notebook, because, you know, the antenna just went off immediately, you know, dead bat.

36:37.389 --> 36:39.611
It was just, I knew there was something.

36:39.631 --> 36:44.077
As soon as I heard that, I said, there's a story, you know, there's a capital S story there.

36:44.918 --> 36:49.343
And I literally, I got up the next morning, and I started writing a scene

36:50.015 --> 37:00.473
about a sorter in a post office, kind of a dreary post office at 2 o'clock in the morning, finding something horrific in a brown paper shoebox.

37:01.174 --> 37:05.121
And I didn't know who the sorter was.

37:05.523 --> 37:06.464
What was in the package?

37:06.504 --> 37:06.944
I didn't know.

37:06.984 --> 37:07.805
Can I just interrupt?

37:07.825 --> 37:09.627
Did your wife ever get the end of the story?

37:09.667 --> 37:10.188
Who was it sent?

37:10.208 --> 37:11.289
Who was it addressed to?

37:11.709 --> 37:26.103
They had who it was addressed to, but there was no return address, and she never followed up on it to find out what the... But that was... The writer and me were really one of those... What you just asked is immediately the questions that ticked off in my head that says there's a novelty because, you know... Why?

37:26.523 --> 37:27.905
Who sent somebody a dead bat?

37:27.945 --> 37:30.587
What had the person done to deserve getting a dead bat?

37:30.627 --> 37:33.370
You know, where do you get a dead bat if you need a dead bat?

37:33.569 --> 37:39.056
And, you know, I was telling that story one time at a sales convention of some book distributors down in Connecticut.

37:39.557 --> 37:40.938
And I was telling it at a luncheon.

37:41.519 --> 37:43.041
And we had finished eating and we were having coffee.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.104
And I'm telling, you know, they found a dead bat.

37:45.124 --> 37:47.847
So I say, just like, just what went off in your head, I say, you know.

37:48.708 --> 37:51.472
And I thought to myself, you know, who do you send a dead bat to?

37:51.612 --> 38:01.685
And without, like, missing a beat, this woman opposite me, you know, who had been very severe all day, you know, lost in thought, she just says, ex-husband.

38:01.825 --> 38:02.766
Immediately, boom.

38:03.050 --> 38:07.957
Hadn't occurred to me, but that sounds legitimate, you know, immediately.

38:08.318 --> 38:09.740
And it doesn't need a return.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.202
No, of course not.

38:11.222 --> 38:14.367
There's going to be some subtext there that's going to be resonant.

38:15.348 --> 38:16.029
Absolutely.

38:16.069 --> 38:19.354
It's not going to know who sent it, but it is going to know who sent it.

38:19.835 --> 38:21.417
It's going to recognize the handwriting.

38:21.437 --> 38:22.138
Absolutely.

38:22.699 --> 38:25.543
All kinds of possibilities, you know.

38:25.563 --> 38:31.572
So for the first time from that incident, I started writing a book without...

38:32.058 --> 38:34.962
any outline, without any idea of the story in line.

38:35.843 --> 38:37.465
And it came together so quickly.

38:38.426 --> 38:39.187
It just snowballed.

38:39.207 --> 38:41.170
It was literally like just... I don't outline anything.

38:41.711 --> 38:42.572
You don't outline at all.

38:43.573 --> 38:45.316
I'm always interested in everyone's process.

38:45.356 --> 38:48.960
I think 638-page books exist without an outline.

38:48.980 --> 38:49.621
That's beautiful.

38:50.342 --> 38:52.485
Believe it or not.

38:53.326 --> 38:56.130
I plague other writers by asking that question.

38:56.470 --> 38:59.314
And I get, like you do, I get every answer, I'm sure.

39:00.239 --> 39:01.260
across the spectrum.

39:01.300 --> 39:05.025
I was... Get it out.

39:05.085 --> 39:06.486
I've never outlined a column.

39:07.047 --> 39:07.648
No.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.232
It's a thousand words, though, and it's very complex.

39:11.693 --> 39:14.976
I like to think it's a complex thing with a beginning and one and an end.

39:14.997 --> 39:15.817
You want it structured, yeah, absolutely.

39:15.838 --> 39:20.803
I structured it, but I know where I'm going to begin and I know I'm going to end, and whatever else happens in between happens.

39:21.464 --> 39:22.666
You know, it's like a jazz piece.

39:22.726 --> 39:28.052
I start and I... It sounds... I was on a... A couple years ago, I was on a bus tour.

39:28.488 --> 39:31.191
It was one of the most fun things I've ever done, promotionally.

39:31.251 --> 39:37.858
Oh, it was wonderful, because it was... Well, let's finish about the bat story.

39:37.918 --> 39:38.959
I'm finished on the bat story.

39:40.040 --> 39:44.004
So the book just sort of, you know, it just coalesced.

39:44.084 --> 39:44.745
It wrote itself.

39:45.446 --> 39:48.709
I had it done in about, I think it was about eight months.

39:50.371 --> 39:54.075
And it ended up being a very different book than what I thought it was going to be at the beginning.

39:55.176 --> 39:56.217
And when it was done...

39:57.513 --> 39:59.616
I didn't know what kind of an animal I had on my hands.

39:59.676 --> 40:14.415
It had all the weirdness and all the obsessional stuff from the first 600-page book, but it also had genre devices that I'd been hoping to make things a little bit more commercial.

40:15.677 --> 40:17.780
So my wife read it, and I said, what do you think?

40:17.820 --> 40:19.863
She says, I think this one has a real shot.

40:20.804 --> 40:23.908
And I said, well, let's call the agent again and see what he says.

40:23.939 --> 40:25.902
Were you writing on a word processor at this time?

40:25.962 --> 40:27.604
Yeah, I was writing.

40:27.624 --> 40:29.707
So you were polishing and revising?

40:29.727 --> 40:30.428
Yeah, oh yeah.

40:30.768 --> 40:33.712
I'm, you know, I just, endless.

40:34.313 --> 40:35.314
I'm obsessional about it.

40:35.354 --> 40:37.137
Yeah, I can't let it go, you know.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.560
I wake up in the night with words.

40:40.601 --> 40:41.082
Right.

40:41.142 --> 40:44.166
That have escaped me for a week.

40:44.186 --> 40:45.548
That would drive me crazy.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.110
Get the notebook.

40:47.130 --> 40:48.692
Yeah, no, I can wake up with it.

40:49.073 --> 40:52.157
And I will rush down immediately to put the word in where it

40:52.475 --> 41:21.537
it has to be yeah it's it's a plague in a sense because uh it's wonderful it's almost it's a delicious pain yeah exactly you can well you can't you can't imagine not doing it in my sense is that as as you know aggravating it is in the sense that there's never a never real closure to it when i had my incident with random house i'll never forget that the next day i went to see somebody you know it was a fire on the knees like oh my god it was devastating i mean it was

41:21.820 --> 41:23.242
Of course, absolutely, of course.

41:23.282 --> 41:28.349
You can contract a book in the works to just be cancelled with no reason given.

41:29.290 --> 41:31.754
And his wife says, well, would you do it again?

41:31.814 --> 41:33.736
I said, Laura, what else do I know how to do it?

41:33.756 --> 41:36.961
I mean, she's like, there's nothing else I can do.

41:37.642 --> 41:39.364
But you tell me, of course I'd do it again.

41:39.685 --> 41:41.106
You're good for the law I call.

41:41.126 --> 41:42.869
Jesus, give me a break when I do it again.

41:45.633 --> 41:46.494
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

41:46.514 --> 41:48.096
So you sent this off to Sobel.

41:48.557 --> 41:51.000
I sent it off to Sobel.

41:51.115 --> 41:56.363
He gave it a read, and he came back to me and said, I like it.

41:56.903 --> 41:58.746
He suggested a few changes.

41:59.066 --> 42:03.333
He's really interactive with his authors.

42:03.353 --> 42:05.135
Did you query him, or did you just send it?

42:05.155 --> 42:05.896
I queried him first.

42:05.956 --> 42:08.620
I wrote a letter and said, give me a third strike.

42:08.801 --> 42:09.802
Will you look at a third book?

42:09.822 --> 42:10.843
Did you apologize for the previous?

42:10.924 --> 42:14.589
Yeah, I said, I agree with your assessment of the last book.

42:14.609 --> 42:15.891
It's a dead issue.

42:16.892 --> 42:18.795
And will you look at a third one?

42:18.815 --> 42:19.536
And he said he would.

42:20.478 --> 42:22.360
You sound like one hell of a nice guy.

42:22.740 --> 42:23.741
He's just wonderful.

42:23.781 --> 42:27.544
He called me, as a matter of fact, he called me not last night, but the night before.

42:27.564 --> 42:28.245
I mean, I'll tell you my agents.

42:28.325 --> 42:29.466
I love my agents.

42:29.566 --> 42:35.471
I would, you know, they stuck with me through, and they made nothing on me, you know.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.793
Yeah, they could do okay now, but go ahead.

42:37.813 --> 42:38.434
I'm sorry.

42:38.454 --> 42:39.135
No, no problem.

42:39.155 --> 42:42.558
I'm always interested to hear how it works all over the playing field, believe me.

42:42.578 --> 42:43.939
They stuck with me.

42:44.580 --> 42:45.000
God bless them.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.621
You know, you really need that, too.

42:46.661 --> 42:47.482
You just, you know.

42:47.522 --> 42:49.624
Well, you need them to read it to say, uh,

42:50.819 --> 42:52.021
I don't need this on tape.

42:52.121 --> 42:53.703
I'll be so furious when I hit myself.

42:56.528 --> 43:01.215
Well, he... Nat wrote back, and he suggested a few changes, and they were good.

43:01.375 --> 43:12.291
They were all great ideas, and I moved the book around the way that he wanted and polished it up and polished it up again and sent it back to him, and... Did you have the title at this point?

43:12.311 --> 43:15.116
At this point, I was already calling it Box 9, yeah.

43:15.136 --> 43:19.202
And he... There was a flurry of activity at the beginning.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.083
This was...

43:21.768 --> 43:23.090
It must have been summer of 90.

43:24.431 --> 43:32.061
And over the course of that summer, there were different editors at different houses that were going back and forth on it.

43:33.522 --> 43:35.765
And I was waiting to hear what was going to happen.

43:35.825 --> 43:42.794
And then sort of all activities ceased, and I didn't hear, as Labor Day in the fall came on, I didn't hear anything at all.

43:43.434 --> 43:49.121
And then what ended up happening was, and I began to think again, well, that was the, you know, we shot the load, that's it.

43:49.842 --> 43:50.543
It's not going to go.

43:51.198 --> 44:03.680
And in December, about a week before Christmas, December of 90, I had had, Nancy and I were here in the office, this was before either of the kids came along, and we had had, you know, classic day from hell.

44:04.021 --> 44:08.469
You know, everything was a problem, from turning the key in the morning to lock up at night.

44:08.489 --> 44:13.778
You know, every phone call, an argument, lost keys, you know, customers bounce checks, everything.

44:14.019 --> 44:14.199
Horrible.

44:14.219 --> 44:14.640
Horrible.

44:15.667 --> 44:19.152
And we worked late, and it got to be about 7 o'clock at night.

44:19.412 --> 44:20.734
We said, let's get the hell out of here.

44:21.314 --> 44:25.881
And she said to me, I'll never forget, she said, you know, it's been such a lousy day anyway.

44:26.281 --> 44:31.889
Why don't we just go and get that last Christmas gift we need at the Greendale Mall, you know, and we'll just shoot the day completely.

44:31.909 --> 44:32.489
I said, fine.

44:32.529 --> 44:35.353
I said, but we've got to let the dog out before we take off.

44:36.294 --> 44:37.756
So we ran into the house.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.058
We didn't even take our coats off.

44:39.477 --> 44:45.787
And I went to leave the dog out, and I noticed in the dark I hadn't let a light on, and the red light on the answering machine was flashing.

44:46.789 --> 44:47.270
And I hit it.

44:48.291 --> 44:51.917
There's the voice saying, Nat Sobel in New York, give me a call when you get in.

44:53.740 --> 44:55.062
And, you know, I froze.

44:55.503 --> 44:57.827
And my wife said, if you don't call him, I will, you know.

44:59.710 --> 45:00.431
Oh, yeah.

45:01.573 --> 45:02.454
Dialed the number.

45:02.674 --> 45:03.696
It's one of the great feelings.

45:04.250 --> 45:06.352
And he came on the line.

45:06.593 --> 45:10.377
Oh, man, I'm telling you, it's the same type of heart and throat.

45:10.517 --> 45:14.422
Oh, yeah.

45:14.742 --> 45:26.195
Especially, you know, like yourself or myself, if you've been doing this since childhood, and you've just been envisioning, you've just been replaying it, you know, over and over, the day that happens, you know.

45:26.776 --> 45:28.418
His voice came on the line.

45:29.107 --> 45:34.812
And every connection we had had prior to this, except for one phone call, had been correspondence.

45:36.213 --> 45:40.977
So he came on the line, and I said, Nat, this is Jack O'Connell calling from Worcester.

45:40.998 --> 45:42.379
I hope I didn't call it a bad time.

45:42.559 --> 45:43.340
What time was it about?

45:43.860 --> 45:46.162
It had to be, by that time, it had to be about 8 o'clock at night.

45:46.302 --> 45:51.967
And he said, he says, no, you didn't call it a bad time, Jack.

45:52.047 --> 45:54.029
And then he leaves the dramatic pause, you know.

45:55.050 --> 45:57.392
And then he comes back, velvet voice, he just comes back.

45:57.862 --> 46:00.004
Congratulations, you're a published novelist.

46:00.524 --> 46:08.252
And I just, and you know, she probably would not want me to tell you this, but behind me, my wife, the tears started running, you know?

46:08.952 --> 46:11.575
I have it for you.

46:11.815 --> 46:14.418
I mean, I saw my book twice, you know.

46:14.458 --> 46:15.639
The first time was a generation.

46:15.659 --> 46:15.959
I know you did.

46:16.519 --> 46:18.301
And the second time was tears.

46:18.381 --> 46:19.983
Absolutely, yeah.

46:20.003 --> 46:20.443
Finally.

46:20.463 --> 46:26.669
I mean, when now he calls me the day before Thanksgiving, and it's a tradition now, he calls me every day the day.

46:26.689 --> 46:27.750
When that starts, tell me.

46:28.051 --> 46:28.812
Will it click on?

46:29.353 --> 46:30.616
It should, but it'll stop turning.

46:30.656 --> 46:30.936
Okay.

46:31.056 --> 46:33.521
And it should make you make a sound.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.524
I mean, I have an internal clock here.

46:35.564 --> 46:36.306
Okay.

46:37.688 --> 46:39.792
And he said, I want you to have a good Thanksgiving tomorrow.

46:39.812 --> 46:40.593
We're going to buy your book.

46:40.613 --> 46:41.916
He said, it's going to take some time.

46:41.936 --> 46:46.123
He said, I've got a lot of people to persuade.

46:46.143 --> 46:47.746
They had to persuade them.

46:47.766 --> 46:49.830
This book had a life, had a commercial.

46:51.092 --> 46:51.713
He's the hero.

46:52.216 --> 46:53.057
Absolutely.

46:53.097 --> 46:54.219
Look at what he's done.

46:54.419 --> 46:59.227
My book is the second best-selling book at home in 1995 after Sue Grafton.

46:59.247 --> 47:01.169
I only got beat by Sue Grafton.

47:01.190 --> 47:02.311
That's unbelievable.

47:02.331 --> 47:04.054
You know, please, she's in another league.

47:04.174 --> 47:04.474
Really?

47:04.795 --> 47:07.018
That is incredible.

47:07.078 --> 47:12.807
My book is 50,000, you know, but there were assholes there that didn't want it, you know.

47:12.989 --> 47:14.510
To this day, they eat crow.

47:14.831 --> 47:18.233
That's why you just need that one champion who's just going to push it through.

47:18.273 --> 47:19.775
This is a book that has to be done.

47:19.895 --> 47:21.256
That must have been a nice Thanksgiving.

47:23.438 --> 47:27.261
But don't get discovered.

47:27.281 --> 47:28.782
It's going to take a while.

47:28.882 --> 47:30.624
It went from Thanksgiving to March.

47:32.205 --> 47:35.488
November, December, January, February, March, before we finally had a contract.

47:35.508 --> 47:37.450
Wow.

47:37.590 --> 47:38.751
I mean, I suffered.

47:38.771 --> 47:41.153
I went 13 months with a book out there.

47:41.173 --> 47:42.574
Now, do you think you're going to stay with them?

47:42.875 --> 47:43.876
Oh, I love them.

47:44.597 --> 47:46.280
When I get home, I'm working on a proposal.

47:46.340 --> 47:47.822
What are the machines?

47:47.842 --> 47:52.968
I don't want to... I go crazy when I'm transcribing this stuff.

47:52.988 --> 47:54.751
I hear myself yakking away.

47:54.771 --> 47:56.153
I swear at myself.

47:56.433 --> 47:56.934
Oh, God.

47:57.514 --> 47:58.135
Go ahead.

47:58.195 --> 48:01.239
So tell me, Sobel, congratulations.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.906
So you're a published novelist, and we never got to get the Christmas present.

48:06.226 --> 48:10.211
We went out to our Toros, had a bottle of wine.

48:10.832 --> 48:12.274
It was just...

48:12.507 --> 48:13.408
Night of a Lifetime.

48:13.428 --> 48:14.670
You know, it's one of those little liberty.

48:14.810 --> 48:17.373
So he had entered in a, now you won a contest, as I understand.

48:17.393 --> 48:19.856
Yeah, and I had no idea about this at all.

48:19.996 --> 48:33.992
Unbeknownst to me, there was a, well, what ended up happening was, he called me back a week or two later, and he said, he says, kid, it's either feast or famine.

48:34.276 --> 48:37.300
Now I'm calling to tell you I've got two offers on the book.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.263
We're going back and forth between two houses.

48:39.803 --> 48:41.305
And the other house was Random House.

48:41.325 --> 48:43.829
So did he run a little auction?

48:43.889 --> 48:45.191
It wasn't exactly an auction.

48:45.211 --> 48:51.199
What he did was he presented the two offers to me, and they were both very close.

48:51.359 --> 48:52.300
They were within $5,000.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.884
So he did multiple submissions then?

48:55.164 --> 48:56.706
I assume it must have been.

48:57.226 --> 48:59.189
So he liked it enough to do that.

48:59.209 --> 48:59.630
Yeah.

48:59.650 --> 49:07.845
The other editor was an editor from Random House called, named Susan Camel, who was Joni Evans' protege, I guess.

49:08.406 --> 49:11.150
That was when they were starting up that Turtle Bay.

49:11.211 --> 49:14.216
Well, I could scan the same day Joni did.

49:15.097 --> 49:16.921
Joni signed the contract in my book.

49:16.941 --> 49:21.208
I mean, I was part of the Joni Evans purge.

49:22.606 --> 49:24.308
I mean, it was nothing personal.

49:24.448 --> 49:29.874
I mean, my husband had gone to another house, and I was inherited by Joe Fox.

49:30.595 --> 49:40.286
And meanwhile, they were cutting the list back 20%, and they were just slicing 20%, you know, and I was kicked out because they had no money tied up in me.

49:40.386 --> 49:41.807
You know, 15 grand, that's all I had.

49:42.288 --> 49:42.788
That's shit.

49:42.929 --> 49:43.749
That's nothing.

49:43.770 --> 49:44.590
You write that up.

49:44.610 --> 49:44.831
Sure.

49:44.851 --> 49:46.032
I mean, I kept the advance.

49:46.923 --> 49:49.166
I got two advances for the book, but so what?

49:49.746 --> 49:50.107
Go ahead.

49:50.127 --> 49:52.450
So you have Random and you have Mysterious.

49:52.550 --> 49:57.435
Yeah, and he was like, where do you want to go?

49:57.516 --> 49:59.578
And I said, I know nothing.

49:59.598 --> 50:00.359
I'm a neophyte.

50:00.379 --> 50:01.200
I have no idea.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.922
You tell me where I should go.

50:03.803 --> 50:16.558
And he said, well, the only thing I will tell you is that, he said, I didn't tell you about this earlier, but I also, Mysterious is having a first novel contest, and your book would be eligible to be part of that.

50:17.230 --> 50:24.539
And he said, you know, in the event you won, he said, I'm not saying that you're going to win, but he said, in the event that you won, the advance would be a good deal more.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.844
And he said, and the promotion would be, they'd spend a lot more on advertising, too.

50:29.866 --> 50:32.769
And I said, well, you know, given that, then let's go with them.

50:33.110 --> 50:34.992
Was Otto Penzler running this at the time?

50:35.092 --> 50:38.376
He had just sold to Warner at the time.

50:38.476 --> 50:41.800
He had just, but Otto, I got a chance to meet Otto.

50:42.241 --> 50:44.243
He was still- He was a book collector, as I am.

50:44.263 --> 50:44.824
Oh, amazing.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.762
He's an amazing guy.

50:46.783 --> 50:50.508
He's somebody I should have almost even had in this book.

50:50.528 --> 50:55.435
Next book, go down and just see his inner sanctum.

50:55.655 --> 50:59.962
I think there are 25,000 rare first editions.

50:59.982 --> 51:00.703
I was in the room.

51:01.384 --> 51:01.884
He's famous.

51:02.025 --> 51:05.850
I know all about it.

51:06.016 --> 51:07.658
He had already sold at that point.

51:08.098 --> 51:15.626
I'm almost sure he had already made the sale to Warner, but they kept him on staff as a consultant for a couple years before he could start his own, exactly.

51:16.407 --> 51:31.583
But what happened was, about three or four months after that, after I decided to go with Mysterious, Nat called me one night, same type of call, and said, you won that damn contest, Al.

51:31.743 --> 51:32.644
How much money was it?

51:32.664 --> 51:33.465
It was 50 grand.

51:34.686 --> 51:34.926
Yeah.

51:35.497 --> 51:36.699
So that was sweet.

51:36.719 --> 51:38.261
It was really sweet, yeah.

51:39.162 --> 51:39.843
That's nice.

51:40.043 --> 51:41.606
Oh, man, I was just floored.

51:41.626 --> 51:42.607
You know, I was dumbstruck.

51:42.647 --> 51:43.829
I was, you know.

51:43.849 --> 51:46.593
I bet the advance for the book wasn't more than $15,000 or $20,000.

51:46.913 --> 51:48.075
That's exactly what it was.

51:48.095 --> 51:48.896
It was $15,000.

51:49.336 --> 51:50.117
And that knocked it up.

51:50.298 --> 51:51.620
Winning the award knocked it up, too.

51:51.940 --> 51:57.908
And included with it was it became an alternate selection for Book of the Month, too, which, as you know, is nice also, you know.

51:58.609 --> 51:59.791
They get that flyer, you know.

52:00.712 --> 52:04.778
And so that was, when that happened, that was just great because

52:05.247 --> 52:11.995
It sort of, before the book hit the stands, it sort of cooked up some free word on it.

52:12.175 --> 52:17.221
You know, there was on the front page of the Life section of USA Today, there was a little blurb on the contest.

52:17.321 --> 52:19.984
And that's when the Boston Globe came down.

52:21.085 --> 52:22.607
And Davis, I think the guy was.

52:23.668 --> 52:25.611
Bill Davis, that was his name from the Globe.

52:26.371 --> 52:26.912
Feature writer.

52:28.334 --> 52:32.959
And so what ended up happening was the...

52:33.327 --> 52:38.294
The book, prior to the book coming out, after I won the award, they had me down to New York.

52:38.554 --> 52:42.820
And, you know, that was my first publishing trip, you know.

52:43.020 --> 52:45.023
It was, you know, I'd been to New York.

52:45.404 --> 52:49.870
I'd been to New York maybe three times in my life prior to that, you know.

52:50.150 --> 52:51.772
So now they're putting you up in a nice hotel.

52:51.993 --> 52:53.174
Oh, unbelievable.

52:53.234 --> 52:55.597
And what happened, and it happened so storybooked, you know.

52:55.618 --> 53:00.364
Things seldom happen in the course of a lifetime this way, but it was so, you know,

53:01.019 --> 53:03.182
So classic for the first novelist.

53:03.282 --> 53:04.644
I showed up.

53:04.664 --> 53:06.506
At that time, they were moving.

53:07.167 --> 53:14.838
They were in the process of moving to the Time Life Building on Avenue of the Americas, but they were still housed at that point in above Otto's store.

53:16.240 --> 53:24.531
I think his store is on West 57, which is a four-story brownstone.

53:24.551 --> 53:27.255
And I went in, and we went up to the offices.

53:27.515 --> 53:28.917
My wife and I went up to the offices.

53:29.133 --> 53:31.075
And we met my editor, Sarah Ann Freed.

53:31.696 --> 53:33.258
And she said, I'll take you in to meet Otto.

53:33.838 --> 53:34.960
So they took me into that room.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.245
And, you know, for a guy who just, you know, cherishes.

53:39.265 --> 53:40.266
I was 30 years old.

53:40.366 --> 53:44.891
And I just, you know, I can't call myself a collector.

53:44.911 --> 53:46.513
You know what a real collector is, you know.

53:46.533 --> 53:49.977
But I've been, I've cherished books forever, you know.

53:50.377 --> 53:53.140
And I've collected the authors who meant a lot to me.

53:53.281 --> 53:54.482
You know, I have a pretty big,

53:54.884 --> 53:56.387
substantial Kerouac collection.

53:56.407 --> 53:59.211
I got a good Pinchon collection, you know, first editions.

53:59.231 --> 53:59.572
Really?

54:00.153 --> 54:02.136
And they're worth some money.

54:02.156 --> 54:04.480
Yeah, the Pinchons have done well lately.

54:04.500 --> 54:05.622
You got dust jackets?

54:05.642 --> 54:07.185
I got, oh, they're pristine, you know.

54:07.225 --> 54:10.290
I got Gravity's Rainbow first, Crying A Lot 49.

54:10.411 --> 54:13.336
I don't have a first of V, unfortunately, but one of these days.

54:13.616 --> 54:15.179
My editor has that in proofs.

54:15.199 --> 54:15.760
He showed it to me.

54:15.840 --> 54:16.521
Oh, my God.

54:16.771 --> 54:18.874
Yeah, well, Ray Roberts is Pinchon's editor.

54:18.894 --> 54:19.435
That's right.

54:19.455 --> 54:20.236
They're right next door.

54:20.356 --> 54:21.478
He moved to Hoth.

54:21.518 --> 54:25.244
That's... Oh, my... So do you... I mean, Alan is... You got to tell me, Nick.

54:25.264 --> 54:26.506
Do you have any inside word?

54:26.907 --> 54:28.309
Do they tell you any stories?

54:28.349 --> 54:30.772
Do they... Or do they not know much themselves?

54:30.792 --> 54:33.196
Do they... No, they know nothing.

54:33.276 --> 54:36.762
Ray Roberts knows, but... But he doesn't tell... I'm going down in a couple weeks.

54:36.822 --> 54:37.963
I'll try and get some shit.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.586
If you ever hear anything, tell me.

54:39.886 --> 54:40.447
I'll ask him.

54:40.467 --> 54:41.289
He'll tell me anything.

54:41.309 --> 54:42.951
But, I mean, I haven't really asked him.

54:43.031 --> 54:44.213
Because in the new book...

54:44.564 --> 54:55.474
I don't know if you got a chance to read it or not, but in the Skin Palace, the central mystery character, this guy Terence Propp, TP, is totally, his whole life is torn from Pinchon.

54:56.275 --> 54:58.977
I gave Pinchon's biography to Terence Propp.

54:59.698 --> 55:09.487
But I went into Otto's inner sanctum, the den there, and all the heavy oak woodwork all the way around, just surrounding it.

55:09.507 --> 55:11.449
It's a womb of books, you know?

55:12.205 --> 55:15.609
And I was just, my mouth was hanging up and just looking at them.

55:15.629 --> 55:16.050
It's thrilling.

55:16.090 --> 55:19.635
If you love books, something like that, just your skin buzzes.

55:19.675 --> 55:21.477
My heart was beating.

55:21.918 --> 55:34.294
And then on top of that, as I'm sitting there and we're pointing out different editions to me, a secretary pokes her head in the door and she says, Otto, Steve and Tabitha King are outside.

55:34.474 --> 55:36.296
Do you have five seconds just to talk to them?

55:36.877 --> 55:38.599
And he says, oh yeah, I'll be right out.

55:38.879 --> 55:40.862
So he walks out and my editor says,

55:41.551 --> 55:42.733
Would you like to meet Stephen King?

55:44.034 --> 55:46.378
You know, kid from Worcester, you know.

55:46.678 --> 55:49.242
He was a prince to me.

55:49.823 --> 55:50.524
And you know what he did?

55:51.185 --> 55:52.166
We walked outside.

55:53.428 --> 55:54.830
He's a little guy, too, right?

55:54.890 --> 55:55.911
He's not a big guy.

55:55.971 --> 55:57.954
He's huge.

55:58.034 --> 55:58.314
He's 6'5".

55:58.335 --> 56:00.738
His wife is very small, but he's enormous.

56:00.818 --> 56:06.546
And he was standing talking to Otto, and we came out.

56:06.779 --> 56:13.249
Otto introduced me and said, Jack just won our contest for the first novelist, best first novel.

56:13.910 --> 56:18.517
And he says to me, that's great, what's it about?

56:19.658 --> 56:24.205
And you can imagine, I went, you know, nothing came out.

56:24.265 --> 56:28.652
My wife was standing embarrassed for me, you know, I can't, I said, I'm stuttering.

56:28.692 --> 56:34.761
And Stephen King, he bursts out laughing, and he just, he steps over next to me, he goes, listen, Jack,

56:35.095 --> 56:38.862
You're going to get asked this question a lot.

56:39.524 --> 56:44.894
He says, if this happens to you, just say, it's about 250 pages, and walk away.

56:44.914 --> 56:45.956
That's a standard answer.

56:45.976 --> 56:47.920
That's what Richard Ford says.

56:48.260 --> 56:50.725
There are people who receive signing, and some guy comes up and says,

56:51.616 --> 56:52.597
He gave him some shit.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.439
He said, clearly you're not going to buy a book.

56:54.599 --> 56:56.201
He said, what's this book go buy anyway?

56:56.221 --> 56:57.563
He said, it's about 437 pages.

56:57.583 --> 56:58.484
And you'll find out.

56:58.624 --> 56:59.585
It's about $22.95.

56:59.625 --> 57:02.027
Take out the card.

57:02.608 --> 57:03.749
But you know, he stepped aside.

57:03.769 --> 57:10.136
It was such a momentous day for me in that, you know, it took on a whole unreal quality.

57:10.897 --> 57:11.398
Surreal.

57:11.878 --> 57:12.579
Very surreal.

57:12.619 --> 57:18.586
I'm this kid from Worcester, never got out of Worcester, never, you know, very unworldly to some extent.

57:18.686 --> 57:18.906
And

57:19.375 --> 57:32.409
I'm standing in a publisher's office in Manhattan, having dreamed my whole life about this moment, and here's Stephen King, and he walked across the room to me and stood there talking about, you know... Did he write you a blurb?

57:33.370 --> 57:34.351
He didn't give me a blurb.

57:34.491 --> 57:35.653
I didn't ask for one, you know.

57:36.153 --> 57:39.036
But Elroy... That's another thing you've got to learn, is don't be shy.

57:39.056 --> 57:40.097
Ask for it wherever you can.

57:40.318 --> 57:43.221
I was interviewing Pat Conroy, and I know Pat now.

57:43.341 --> 57:44.362
We're friends.

57:44.482 --> 57:46.644
This is the fourth time I've been with Pat.

57:46.664 --> 57:47.205
God, he's...

57:47.675 --> 57:48.897
going back to the Great Santini.

57:48.917 --> 57:49.297
He's great.

57:49.318 --> 57:50.199
We're the same age.

57:50.399 --> 57:51.701
He's just great.

57:51.761 --> 57:55.187
And I've caused him to miss four interviews.

57:56.208 --> 57:58.171
So we're here in New York in June.

57:58.191 --> 57:59.113
You must know everyone.

57:59.193 --> 58:00.014
You must know everyone.

58:00.114 --> 58:00.835
Yeah, pretty much.

58:00.875 --> 58:02.418
So Packham's, he gives me a big hug.

58:02.438 --> 58:04.901
He says, I'm so proud of you for your book.

58:04.921 --> 58:05.963
I says, yeah, you're proud.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.626
I says, you never wrote me a goddamn book.

58:08.888 --> 58:09.749
I never got it.

58:09.789 --> 58:11.792
He says, because he had moved in 2017.

58:12.245 --> 58:13.727
He said, well, shit, what do we need?

58:13.827 --> 58:15.769
He took my pad like this.

58:16.310 --> 58:17.211
Oh, my God.

58:17.231 --> 58:23.458
And he wrote out a thing like this, and then he says, change it to anything you want, signed to Pat Conroy, and I brought it up down to Holton.

58:23.598 --> 58:25.360
That's the blurb in the Book of the Month Club.

58:25.400 --> 58:25.980
That is tremendous.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.243
He said, well, come on, let's do it right now.

58:28.583 --> 58:29.865
I have it.

58:30.005 --> 58:30.826
You should frame it.

58:31.467 --> 58:32.848
I have it on my thing.

58:32.908 --> 58:33.909
I just love it, you know.

58:34.230 --> 58:35.892
That's a classic story.

58:36.592 --> 58:38.134
He said, well, let's do it right now.

58:38.468 --> 58:41.211
Anyway, so let's... I know.

58:41.231 --> 58:42.873
I am just digressing.

58:43.634 --> 58:49.480
I encourage it, because I like a nice... Well, you can pick and choose whatever you want to use, but... So, all right.

58:49.500 --> 58:52.703
So the book came out when... Give me the update again of that.

58:52.763 --> 58:55.486
The first book, Box 9, came out January of 92.

58:55.987 --> 58:56.828
And how did it do?

58:57.228 --> 58:57.749
It did well.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.130
The numbers?

58:59.531 --> 59:00.232
I have no idea.

59:00.312 --> 59:02.794
What was the first printing?

59:02.834 --> 59:03.155
Do you remember?

59:03.215 --> 59:06.719
I think the first printing was 10,000 copies, though.

59:07.299 --> 59:08.020
I have also...

59:08.303 --> 59:10.947
It's been suggested to me that maybe it was 5,000 copies.

59:12.028 --> 59:14.251
And so I have no idea.

59:14.271 --> 59:18.858
Jim Crumley said to me one time, you know, don't even listen to their numbers when you tell you.

59:18.998 --> 59:20.180
It's just not going to be the case.

59:20.801 --> 59:22.744
But it came out in a paperback edition.

59:22.764 --> 59:25.527
It went into a second printing in the paperback edition.

59:25.608 --> 59:30.835
And we had for a time, for about two years running, we had a film option on the damn thing.

59:31.304 --> 59:34.788
So every six months, they picked up on it, which was, that was gravy, you know.

59:35.109 --> 59:49.887
It wasn't, but it was, the nice part about it was, it was totally unexpected, and it was, and I'm such a movie freak, but even the possibility, you know, of that happening, you know, is just, it was sweet, you know, it was really.

59:51.308 --> 59:58.577
You know, they eventually, it changed hands, well, it didn't change hands, but it got, you know, bigger companies,

59:58.810 --> 01:00:02.814
Bigger production companies kept eating the smaller fish, and it eventually got dropped.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.876
So let's go ahead to the next book now.

01:00:04.956 --> 01:00:11.001
Now, had you decided that everything was going to, that you were going to create a community, a town?

01:00:11.021 --> 01:00:14.104
I mean, this is your... It happened pretty organically, you know.

01:00:14.384 --> 01:00:19.990
I think it was... The Boston writers, the LA writers, the Chicago writers, the Worcester writers, I guess.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:26.175
I never sat down and said, you know, I was going to be this crime regionalist, you know.

01:00:26.616 --> 01:00:27.957
What happened was more that...

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:47.846
I had a really specific set of locales in my brain, which, to my understanding, and I know people disagree with it, were, you know, the basis of them, the seed of them, came certainly out of Worcester.

01:00:48.567 --> 01:00:55.497
But I feel that I warp them and magnify them and elongate them so much that they, you know, they're really more some...

01:00:55.966 --> 01:00:57.850
No man's land, and they are.

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:17.248
Yeah, but it absolutely, well, basically do my working process, and you can extrapolate from this, my working process is I'll have a very good idea of what settings, the settings will be for each chapter, and I'll go to that, and it's a specific literal place here in the city, and I'll go.
