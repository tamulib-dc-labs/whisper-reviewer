WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:08.239
Okay, that's a Redding Hardware Company, Columbian pattern.

00:12.084 --> 00:13.366
Columbian design.

00:15.709 --> 00:16.810
This is about 1895.

00:16.870 --> 00:20.175
And how would I clean that up?

00:20.235 --> 00:28.125
Just soak it in a paint strip or something, and then if you want to polish it, polish it, or just leave the original patina on there.

00:28.145 --> 00:28.886
That's wonderful.

00:29.087 --> 00:30.388
And this too, I clean.

00:30.428 --> 00:31.590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32.684 --> 00:33.505
Thanks.

00:33.525 --> 00:34.807
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:36.029 --> 00:39.454
There's something you could hang from where your chandeliers used to be down here.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.176
Yeah, I've still got some chandeliers here.

00:41.216 --> 00:42.097
You didn't get everything.

00:42.838 --> 00:44.300
I could put that back in the dining room.

00:44.321 --> 00:46.744
There's a flat one like what's in there.

00:47.004 --> 00:49.688
Let's see the doorknob.

00:49.708 --> 00:50.650
You know what this is?

00:50.670 --> 00:55.857
This is an old gas light, and I got the tapers in there to, you see, you turn the key.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.843
See these gas chandeliers had a key?

00:59.863 --> 01:01.265
Yeah, for gas.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.286
Turn it on.

01:04.612 --> 01:06.514
Well, that fits and you can turn it.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.716
And then this has a wax taper.

01:08.756 --> 01:09.978
There's some in there and you light it.

01:10.118 --> 01:12.440
It's a gas, for gas lights.

01:14.022 --> 01:17.666
They got something like that, like down in the penal hole.

01:17.726 --> 01:18.206
Yeah.

01:18.226 --> 01:25.714
Looks like an old... I used to have that in my old warehouse.

01:25.734 --> 01:27.236
That's just an old fake.

01:27.256 --> 01:29.879
I used to put it up on the bracket and plug it in so the light was in it.

01:29.899 --> 01:31.961
If somebody broke in, they'd think it would.

01:32.001 --> 01:33.823
They were getting photographed.

01:33.843 --> 01:33.943
Yeah.

01:34.362 --> 01:38.348
I didn't have a video system in there, but I did have an alarm system in there.

01:38.808 --> 01:39.670
Where was this?

01:39.770 --> 01:40.711
Minneapolis.

01:42.153 --> 01:45.197
I didn't want to spend the money on a video, but I just had that up.

01:45.217 --> 01:46.259
I bought that as a sale.

01:47.020 --> 01:49.263
It's just as a dummy, you know, something.

01:49.303 --> 01:51.046
Got in there and saw the camera.

01:51.526 --> 01:55.412
Well, that works, you know.

01:55.432 --> 01:57.274
That's the one he stole out of the front.

01:59.958 --> 02:01.180
It's getting jimmy in here now.

02:01.835 --> 02:13.072
Well, Mr. Hall, I suppose.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.819
For a moment, I came alive again when I came in here, you know.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.588
I could see I forgot about what happened, you know.

02:25.911 --> 02:28.115
Collections do that.

02:28.135 --> 02:30.238
We lose ourselves and then, don't we?

02:31.450 --> 02:35.674
That's for a heater.

02:36.695 --> 02:37.055
Yeah?

02:37.075 --> 02:52.150
Yeah, those heaters that you pick up by the handle, that's the end of the sort of work.

02:52.250 --> 02:58.656
It's got two former ownerships and, uh,

03:00.155 --> 03:05.762
The President's Daughter by Nan Britton, B-R-I-T-T-O-N, 1927.

03:07.004 --> 03:08.346
Pulled by Stephen out of a dumpster.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.551
Can you believe that?

03:12.752 --> 03:26.810
Yeah, taking a picture of the dumpster.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.554
You, we all three, we all four witnessed on him.

03:30.108 --> 03:34.572
We all four witnessed him pull out a book like that.

03:34.833 --> 03:41.339
Nobody will ever know.

03:41.479 --> 03:45.203
See, he don't believe it, look.

03:45.223 --> 03:47.045
He just found that autobiography about it.

03:47.065 --> 03:50.548
That's a nice book, isn't it?

03:50.568 --> 03:52.790
1927.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.712
Well, gentlemen, I'll take you out to dinner.

03:55.653 --> 03:56.734
We'll drop Mr. Hall.

03:56.754 --> 03:57.735
Is that all right with you?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.920
I'm riding with you, sir.

04:00.441 --> 04:00.661
All right.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.725
Nobody should be hungry in the land of plenty.

04:05.847 --> 04:09.010
Now let's excuse it.

04:09.331 --> 04:12.975
Well, Luke, I promised you a day in the life of Stephen Blumberg, all right?

04:13.055 --> 04:13.656
You delivered it.

04:14.577 --> 04:15.398
Can you believe it?

04:15.418 --> 04:15.998
Are you happy?

04:16.219 --> 04:17.640
I'm happy.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.741
Watch out.

04:19.863 --> 04:20.944
Can you believe that?

04:21.064 --> 04:21.865
I'm overwhelmed.

04:23.207 --> 04:24.448
Find an autobiography.

04:26.825 --> 04:29.028
about the president.

04:29.549 --> 04:31.151
See, I bet that would be worth something.

04:31.292 --> 04:33.815
Yeah, that's a saleable book.

04:34.156 --> 04:34.496
Yeah, sure.

04:34.516 --> 04:36.019
Yeah, I checked it.

04:36.079 --> 04:37.481
It's not a reprint, either.

04:37.921 --> 04:39.824
This is a nice book, you know.

04:39.924 --> 04:43.289
I don't have too much Iowa material.

04:44.992 --> 04:46.654
Let me see that autobiography book.

04:46.674 --> 04:48.657
It's a biography, it's not an autobiography.

04:49.058 --> 04:49.879
I think, right?

04:50.416 --> 04:52.700
Autobiography is a book you write about yourself.

04:53.381 --> 04:55.445
This is a biography about her writing about you.

04:55.465 --> 04:57.068
It's a biography you write about somebody else.

04:58.050 --> 05:01.717
We'll go out to that place out on the edge of town.

05:02.398 --> 05:06.386
You know where we go, that little... What's that out there, Mr. Hall?

05:09.331 --> 05:10.874
Uh... I'd give it a little something.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.058
Something pretty full of iron.

05:13.078 --> 05:13.178
Yeah.

05:13.399 --> 05:13.639
Dang it.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.735
Well, Steve, what did you just ask them?

05:18.216 --> 05:21.042
Are the people in this town still pretty much on my side?

05:21.543 --> 05:22.605
Mr. Hall, what did you say?

05:23.226 --> 05:24.469
What did they say, Mr. Hall?

05:24.649 --> 05:28.557
Well, you know, they said, hell, they have a hell, a heart and a heart and a fluidity.

05:28.618 --> 05:30.261
He's guilty of it.

05:30.241 --> 05:32.424
Yeah, they take up for Steve all the time.

05:32.685 --> 05:33.386
Oh, that's good.

05:33.406 --> 05:34.287
I'm glad to hear that.

05:34.307 --> 05:35.429
I got a place to go.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.652
Well, because this is home.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.976
You want to be welcome in your home, right?

05:40.196 --> 05:41.899
I really don't know that many people.

05:41.979 --> 05:47.467
Minneapolis, but... A lot of people told me they said they have one hell of a town where he got all them sites.

05:47.487 --> 05:48.749
Well, that's good.

05:49.029 --> 05:53.155
Yeah, I've become kind of a folk legend here, I suppose.

05:53.176 --> 05:53.516
You think so?

05:53.536 --> 05:54.197
I guess you can.

05:54.257 --> 05:55.860
Seem to be, you know, pretty successful.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.505
I think he's going to put Oski on the map even more.

05:59.907 --> 06:00.528
Oski.

06:00.808 --> 06:01.929
What's Oski?

06:02.329 --> 06:03.170
I mean, Otumwa.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.271
Otumwa, yeah.

06:07.374 --> 06:08.595
I like Otumwa.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.257
I'd like to come back here someday.

06:12.679 --> 06:13.800
Can you believe it?

06:13.820 --> 06:14.841
Just pull this out of here.

06:14.861 --> 06:17.844
Are you more comfortable on the road, or do you like staying in this place?

06:18.685 --> 06:22.869
Well, I like being on the road, but I don't know.

06:22.909 --> 06:25.932
I like to come back someplace where I'm wanted to, you know?

06:28.257 --> 06:33.503
Do you agree with this defense that you're taking?

06:33.523 --> 06:45.936
If they could do me some good, but putting me in prison or in an institution isn't a normal place to get people adjusted.

06:47.338 --> 06:47.878
I don't know.

06:48.399 --> 06:54.345
Maybe the whole world's out of sync and I'm all right.

06:54.405 --> 06:54.906
I don't know.

06:56.202 --> 06:57.483
I don't know anymore, though.

06:57.603 --> 06:59.305
I mean, this wasn't your idea, was it?

06:59.625 --> 07:00.186
What?

07:00.226 --> 07:00.866
This defense?

07:01.907 --> 07:04.109
Whose idea was it to take the defense that they take?

07:04.129 --> 07:05.110
The Menninger Clinic.

07:07.973 --> 07:10.074
That was their idea, or your lawyers, would you say?

07:10.495 --> 07:11.295
It's hard to say.

07:12.376 --> 07:13.557
Yeah, it is.

07:13.618 --> 07:14.779
No, the Menninger Clinic.

07:16.620 --> 07:25.348
They took me down there and had me all, because I'd had some problems in the past, you know.

07:31.893 --> 07:34.837
Well, that comes next week, doesn't it, huh?

07:34.857 --> 07:35.018
Yeah.

07:39.785 --> 07:41.107
What's the next question again?

07:41.127 --> 07:41.728
What do you think?

07:41.748 --> 07:42.749
You think I'm crazy?

07:44.672 --> 07:48.198
I've been in your presence now for 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

07:48.338 --> 07:48.438
Yeah.

07:49.079 --> 07:56.190
And you picked me up six hours ago, and you are as lucid and as intelligent a person as I know.

07:56.991 --> 07:57.712
Well, thank you.

07:58.693 --> 08:00.516
You have done a few bizarre things.

08:00.850 --> 08:04.077
That can be undone.

08:04.659 --> 08:07.405
Every man has a right to a mistake, Dougie.

08:07.425 --> 08:09.209
I saw you jump into a couple of dumpsters.

08:09.530 --> 08:13.218
That's strange behavior, but it's not crazy.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.089
But when I came out with something that was good, you rescued something.

08:18.150 --> 08:20.074
Let me tell you a story.

08:20.476 --> 08:29.110
But that was seized.

08:30.492 --> 08:36.662
Did you have that on the wall?

08:36.642 --> 08:41.147
No, I kept it for the case.

08:41.228 --> 08:41.868
Did you?

08:41.928 --> 08:45.332
But it should be pointed out that you would never break up a book to take up a book.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.254
No, no, no, no, I never.

08:46.274 --> 08:47.415
I think that's a sinful thing.

08:47.455 --> 08:49.598
That is a sinful thing to do.

08:49.858 --> 08:51.860
Yeah, break up a book.

08:52.001 --> 08:53.582
I used to hate those people.

08:53.602 --> 08:55.465
They don't listen with rapists.

08:55.505 --> 08:57.507
They used to take the steel engraving.

08:58.869 --> 09:03.174
Some of you used to say, man, I don't understand, because I wrote it for other people off me.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.517
That's still another you thing.

09:05.537 --> 09:05.637
Yeah.

09:06.241 --> 09:19.859
Well, if you win, who says you have to go into the green bin?

09:23.423 --> 09:30.072
The easiest way to pour out of this is just to take the lid off.

09:30.192 --> 09:30.412
Okay.

09:31.454 --> 09:32.715
Who says that?

09:32.735 --> 09:34.097
The government.

09:34.117 --> 09:34.678
If you win?

09:35.159 --> 09:35.539
Yeah.

09:36.413 --> 09:37.475
Right.

09:37.495 --> 09:38.296
If you win, you win.

09:38.336 --> 09:39.417
You're acquitted, right?

09:39.858 --> 09:44.345
Yeah, but then I'm crazy and I'm a danger to society.

09:44.465 --> 09:45.586
I've got to be locked up.

09:45.606 --> 09:47.970
They're going to try to get you on that road.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.856
If you're not guilty, then they're going to try to put you away.

09:51.876 --> 09:53.157
You want some more of us, too?

09:53.178 --> 09:55.321
No, no, for medical reasons.

09:55.901 --> 09:59.687
That's what I tell society I care about.

10:00.005 --> 10:12.579
Do you take pills?

10:12.600 --> 10:18.326
Well, I have a prescription for them.

10:18.927 --> 10:22.431
I really don't like taking them because they make me feel funny, you know?

10:22.451 --> 10:22.551
Yeah.

10:22.571 --> 10:26.315
Yeah, it's pretty sad they got to have such a low-down perfect person to represent one.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.678
Most generally, you'd think they'd want somebody truthful and respectful.

10:29.401 --> 10:33.325
I wanted somebody to know.

10:33.345 --> 10:34.606
You know, you know how I live.

10:34.947 --> 10:37.269
It's not somebody telling you.

10:37.289 --> 10:38.711
It's not going to help, see.

10:38.731 --> 10:42.094
It's not for me to go and talk to Wanda.

10:42.114 --> 10:46.999
You know, for me to talk to Wanda and ask if Wanda tell me about Steve, that's not going to do any good, is it?

10:47.099 --> 10:49.842
It's better for me to talk to Steve to find out about Steve.

10:49.902 --> 10:54.447
Well, yeah, but I suppose she won't tell you about me in her perspective.

10:54.646 --> 10:57.913
Yeah, that would be interesting.

10:57.933 --> 11:04.407
But she doesn't have the passion of the collective.

11:04.447 --> 11:07.333
So what do you think?

11:07.573 --> 11:10.981
What do you prefer?

11:11.001 --> 11:12.925
A victory or a defeat here?

11:12.945 --> 11:13.446
I don't know.

11:13.466 --> 11:15.490
I'm just screwed.

11:15.672 --> 11:33.360
It's a matter of a lesser unemployment of two mistakes, you know?

11:34.454 --> 11:41.846
Say that again?

11:41.926 --> 11:46.393
I love old things.

11:47.154 --> 11:55.888
Books were just a part of things.

11:57.995 --> 12:00.798
Are old things, are they a touchstone for you?

12:01.800 --> 12:05.725
Is this a means by which you're able to commune with the past?

12:05.745 --> 12:12.393
Well, in some ways, but there are a lot of other people that are interested in too.

12:12.533 --> 12:21.344
I was told by somebody once, one of my friends, I managed to smoke that milk all the way back here.

12:21.364 --> 12:24.408
You had sauerkraut salad and coleslaw?

12:24.608 --> 12:25.109
Yeah.

12:25.129 --> 12:25.810
That's good.

12:25.830 --> 12:26.230
Thank you.

12:26.868 --> 12:40.246
Set the rolls here in the middle.

12:40.546 --> 12:43.110
Thank you.

12:43.210 --> 12:47.195
I was told by somebody this is the age of no age.

12:47.636 --> 12:53.944
People are so distressed with the times that they like to identify with other times.

12:54.304 --> 12:56.267
I don't have many problems.

12:57.327 --> 13:02.035
communicating my sentiments and my interests with a wide spectrum of people.

13:02.135 --> 13:08.906
I can pick up with people from like Adam all the way to Mr. Hall, you know.

13:11.350 --> 13:11.670
And you.

13:14.715 --> 13:16.939
And you're not, you know, it's nice to talk, right?

13:17.678 --> 13:25.166
You take people for what they are, regardless of color or nationality.

13:25.186 --> 13:33.276
Now, Steve, this thing about the bar quote, I mean, were you talking seriously to these kids, or are you just joking?

13:33.296 --> 13:35.017
Well, I was talking in anachronism.

13:35.078 --> 13:36.279
I read it in a book.

13:36.299 --> 13:45.289
And it was symbolistically, the government is regimenting people more and more and more.

13:45.505 --> 13:48.067
We are essentially all barcoded right now.

13:48.568 --> 13:57.836
The day they give you a social security, and they require it now in Brooke, my daughter's had social security numbers within three days of their Brooke, you see.

13:58.697 --> 14:01.460
So that's your basic barcode.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.961
Who doesn't want to be on it?

14:03.321 --> 14:06.905
You say you want truth, and you're just a writer and investigator.

14:08.386 --> 14:11.149
Who doesn't want to talk to you?

14:11.169 --> 14:12.610
Lots of people.

14:12.961 --> 14:14.543
I mean, which side, you know?

14:14.563 --> 14:15.564
That's right.

14:17.025 --> 14:22.971
I think you're going to like my book.

14:29.538 --> 14:37.706
I guess I'll ask you if you were apprehensive about what happened this week.

14:37.726 --> 14:39.668
You said you are?

14:39.688 --> 14:40.669
Yeah, yeah.

14:41.210 --> 14:41.550
I'm apprehensive.

14:42.982 --> 14:49.770
Have any apprehensive even about the kinds of things that they're going to present in your defense?

14:49.790 --> 14:51.773
Well, that's going to be kind of painful, isn't it?

14:51.793 --> 14:56.519
Yeah, yeah, it will be.

14:56.539 --> 14:57.720
Publish it all on the paper.

14:57.740 --> 14:58.581
Who needs this, right?

14:58.601 --> 15:03.167
I mean, your father's going to testify, and these people from the Mullinger are going to testify.

15:03.187 --> 15:07.352
Well, what can I do?

15:07.889 --> 15:16.862
I gotta keep on living.

15:16.882 --> 15:24.633
It's just a bad situation that circumstances have gotten me into.

15:24.653 --> 15:28.818
Maybe some day, some way, I can unravel my way out of it.

15:29.019 --> 15:34.506
It's funny.

15:34.526 --> 15:35.668
Life has become...

15:37.808 --> 15:44.623
When I sleep at night and dream, I go back to the way things were, and I'm more secure.

15:44.643 --> 15:47.128
And when I wake up, the nightmare starts.

15:49.112 --> 15:49.894
The actual nightmare?

15:51.106 --> 16:15.190
Have you ever been on a drunk and gone in jail and you wake up and you're in jail and it takes you about 15 minutes to figure out where you are and why you're there?

16:15.642 --> 16:18.727
Does that happen to you?

16:18.967 --> 16:19.989
I don't really drink.

16:20.069 --> 16:25.938
What's happening?

16:26.378 --> 16:35.012
Yeah, I've been arrested in the past.

16:35.272 --> 16:37.255
I wake up.

16:37.275 --> 16:43.084
It takes me a long time to figure out what's happened.

16:43.368 --> 16:49.494
Would you consider yourself a happy person prior to this?

16:49.514 --> 16:50.034
Somewhat.

16:51.956 --> 16:59.804
Of course, now I realize I had more than that.

17:00.585 --> 17:06.410
I should have been happier than what I had, than what I have now.

17:07.111 --> 17:13.257
I'd sure be contented if I was back where it was, or even to be

17:13.625 --> 17:16.108
and not have my friends in trouble.

17:16.248 --> 17:21.034
I feel terrible for those boys.

17:21.955 --> 17:25.379
Well, if you could undo any of this.

17:25.459 --> 17:30.004
And even some of the librarians, well.

17:31.026 --> 17:34.369
You mean those who were affected by these activities?

17:34.389 --> 17:39.696
Yeah, I looked at them as people, and I saw them as people.

17:39.716 --> 17:39.936
I felt bad.

17:40.962 --> 17:44.345
I liked it.

17:44.365 --> 17:47.669
I looked down there.

17:47.689 --> 17:48.009
I liked people.

17:48.029 --> 17:51.973
And you said when the blue came in.

17:51.993 --> 17:54.416
Yeah, that was... I wanted to shake his hand.

17:54.756 --> 17:55.517
He'd only come halfway up.

17:55.537 --> 17:57.899
And he, like those, went back.

17:57.919 --> 18:06.748
See, the government got to him.

18:06.768 --> 18:07.729
I think they think...

18:08.452 --> 18:16.202
He was the guy because of the similarities and maybe he got thrown in jail or something.

18:16.763 --> 18:21.489
Well, that probably made his life miserable.

18:21.509 --> 18:24.573
Oh, I feel terrible about that.

18:24.593 --> 18:27.497
If your name's floating around all of a sudden.

18:27.517 --> 18:32.544
Well, that's one of the unhappy consequences of the whole thing, isn't it?

18:32.564 --> 18:33.925
How about the activity?

18:34.086 --> 18:37.530
Would you have to do all that going back 20 years?

18:37.915 --> 18:43.505
The collecting of books started in the 70s, as they said.

18:44.967 --> 18:45.068
Yeah.

18:45.088 --> 18:54.845
In the manner that we... Mostly in the manner that we've done today in buying it.

18:54.925 --> 19:01.797
Sort of, as I learn more and more, it sort of builds itself up.

19:01.912 --> 19:05.778
That's biglomania.

19:05.798 --> 19:07.340
I've heard of it.

19:07.360 --> 19:22.161
Would you say that you qualify for 15 minutes on the rolls?

19:22.181 --> 19:22.802
Yeah.

19:22.822 --> 19:24.865
You know, I would be happier, though.

19:25.553 --> 19:28.816
I worried so much and tried to protect this stuff so much.

19:28.876 --> 19:39.848
I think I would be happier if I didn't have so much to look out for and protect, and I could go over to friends and share their stuff with them as I try to share my stuff.

19:39.868 --> 19:54.143
Of course, I like to share it with people that don't have an opportunity to see it either, because they can learn, like Adam and saw things today that he enjoyed that he'd never seen, you know, and Mr. Hall, you know.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.939
Don't you think it's nice that they can enjoy these things too?

19:57.979 --> 20:02.269
We enjoy them.

20:02.329 --> 20:08.605
The one woman yesterday, was it from Connecticut?

20:08.625 --> 20:12.334
It wasn't such a good idea to...

20:12.601 --> 20:19.430
to deprive the world of scholarship access to these primary materials.

20:19.450 --> 20:33.169
I'm sure you'd acknowledge that that was probably something that was not... But printed books, you know, there are printed books everywhere, I guess.

20:33.189 --> 20:35.972
You know, that doesn't impede the progress of scholarship.

20:36.353 --> 20:39.537
Well, but still, I...

20:39.803 --> 20:48.077
I had a chance to have them, enjoy them, share them with some people that otherwise wouldn't even know how.

20:48.798 --> 20:57.272
Knowledge is something that you give away and you gain, you know.

20:57.813 --> 21:01.599
And it's not like money where you give away and have less and less of them.

21:01.659 --> 21:05.085
I was able to share that knowledge.

21:05.673 --> 21:15.964
the feel of fine books and that with people who never otherwise had done that for a while.

21:15.984 --> 21:25.654
Did you ever, while this was going on, save yourself, Steven, it's time to stop?

21:25.674 --> 21:28.937
What were you having?

21:28.957 --> 21:31.019
The one we'll shake at the fan of Riverside.

21:31.039 --> 21:31.560
Were you scared out there?

21:31.580 --> 21:31.680
Yeah.

21:31.998 --> 21:33.740
And they just blew it, right?

21:33.820 --> 21:34.621
They just let you go.

21:34.821 --> 21:40.807
I mean... That was close, right?

21:40.827 --> 21:40.927
Yeah.

21:40.947 --> 21:43.270
But did you stop there?

21:43.290 --> 21:43.610
You didn't.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.652
Well, I just went one more time.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.414
That was with Bill.

21:47.434 --> 21:57.685
Well, that was almost his idea, too, right?

21:57.705 --> 21:58.005
Thanks, sir.

21:59.048 --> 22:11.218
Oh, it's fine, but I don't see where she put it.

22:12.278 --> 22:13.320
Anyway, go ahead.

22:13.340 --> 22:18.552
Tell me, go through your relationship again with the Rosenwald.

22:18.892 --> 22:19.414
Oh, okay.

22:19.474 --> 22:20.496
No, Rosenwald.

22:20.877 --> 22:24.064
Lessing Rosen... You said Rosenbeck.

22:24.084 --> 22:25.046
No, no, no, no.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.168
Lessing Jay Rosenwald.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.010
Yeah.

22:27.331 --> 22:28.974
The boy Sears.

22:29.275 --> 22:30.658
I have his book...

22:30.942 --> 22:55.768
uh recollections of a collector very serious book i had that too you did that's a wonderful book he published it himself yeah uh the one that was alive that was a friend of rosenbach's his mother the book collector's mother now who rosenback or rosenwald excuse me rosenwald okay anybody

22:55.968 --> 23:06.022
Blessing Rosenwald's mother was a St.

23:06.182 --> 23:07.444
Paulite.

23:07.464 --> 23:09.747
She was a friend of my grandmother's.

23:09.767 --> 23:13.152
I thought you said there was a blood relationship.

23:13.172 --> 23:14.253
No blood relationship, no.

23:14.333 --> 23:19.701
We've been a prominent family in the Twin Cities since back in the last century.

23:19.721 --> 23:22.785
We knew all the people, especially the Jewish people.

23:23.288 --> 23:48.182
well rosenwald will get mentioned in my book of course yeah uh there's a front text that i really like about those awards what is it the bandidi of the plains that was published out in cheyenne wyoming and it's about the cattle barons and uh what's the title bandidi of the plains yeah is published out in wyoming and uh i guess every copy of that

23:48.162 --> 23:55.650
or every known copy has been either bought up and destroyed or ruined out of libraries.

23:55.670 --> 23:59.113
That was back in the 19th century.

23:59.233 --> 24:03.197
In fact, it's really territorial imprint, I guess, too.

24:03.358 --> 24:08.603
Grant Vaughan Press did a reprint out of it in 30 years.

24:08.803 --> 24:12.567
See, the walking forts of information.

24:12.547 --> 24:15.853
Do you carry all this information around?

24:16.013 --> 24:16.835
I guess you'd have to.

24:17.136 --> 24:20.442
Yeah, as I need it, yeah.

24:20.722 --> 24:29.759
I had a grab horn for this edition of that.

24:29.779 --> 24:30.160
Grab horn is major.

24:30.180 --> 24:34.588
Most collectors like to take things out that I know and enjoy them as a tactile.

24:34.568 --> 24:35.931
Well, I do that too.

24:36.012 --> 24:40.583
I enjoy them, but I like to share them.

24:41.245 --> 24:50.569
I'll buy a copy of your book from you and donate it to the Otumwa Public Library.

24:51.713 --> 24:53.695
They said what?

24:54.156 --> 24:59.802
They didn't like me going to the atomic police department reporting roads, but it turned out favorable.

24:59.822 --> 25:00.983
Who didn't like it?

25:01.003 --> 25:07.790
Well, they were worried that, let's put this way to protect you.

25:07.871 --> 25:14.318
They told me if I got down here, they'd beat me up and that I disgraced the town.

25:14.778 --> 25:15.679
Who said that?

25:16.013 --> 25:17.635
The difference?

25:17.675 --> 25:18.556
Yeah.

25:20.278 --> 25:24.522
But I guess it wouldn't be wise for our down here picking up chumming people.

25:24.542 --> 25:26.744
We've got to maintain the color.

25:26.784 --> 25:31.529
Well, when you picked me up today, for instance.

25:31.549 --> 25:34.453
And Rhonda wouldn't even get up and go see you.

25:35.313 --> 25:40.879
No, but I mean, when you picked me up today, I made sure there was nobody.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.422
Yeah, yeah.

25:43.705 --> 25:51.326
So I just made sure that there was no, you know, I don't want to see something in the car.

25:51.567 --> 25:52.249
I appreciate it.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.497
So, how's he doing?

25:56.219 --> 25:56.941
Almost done.

25:56.961 --> 25:58.626
Thank you.

25:59.230 --> 26:01.873
His name was Mr. Stovasher.

26:01.913 --> 26:02.855
He was an old man.

26:02.895 --> 26:03.796
He had one hand.

26:04.577 --> 26:06.179
And he was a master locksmith.

26:06.980 --> 26:10.004
And they had him in a cell right across from the guard station.

26:10.585 --> 26:13.288
And I used to go in and he collected antique locks.

26:13.368 --> 26:14.970
No thanks.

26:14.990 --> 26:18.295
I used to go in and talk about antique locks and stuff with him and this and that.

26:18.595 --> 26:23.641
And I said, Mr. Stovasher, you don't look like you hurt anybody or anything.

26:23.681 --> 26:25.664
He was like a 65-year-old man.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.526
Why do they keep such an eye on you?

26:27.627 --> 26:28.748
And he told me, he says,

26:29.183 --> 26:30.965
I could be out of here in 30 minutes.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.329
And there must have been about 10 different places you go through.

26:35.829 --> 26:37.191
And I says, how do you figure?

26:37.211 --> 26:39.473
And he says, well, these, you know what kind of locks these are?

26:39.493 --> 26:41.955
And I says, yeah, they're old Flagler locks.

26:41.975 --> 26:51.744
And he says, well, I can, with a hairpin or a bobby pin or something, I can, in about five minutes of lock, get through and get out of here.

26:51.764 --> 26:53.546
So they won't let me get out of their sight.

26:53.706 --> 26:55.528
I've been here for nine months.

26:55.627 --> 26:58.352
With one hand.

26:58.693 --> 27:01.479
Boy, he's really got a talent.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.166
You ain't kidding, with one hand.

27:05.406 --> 27:06.769
Is that right?

27:06.809 --> 27:07.731
You let it dance to death?

27:07.791 --> 27:09.935
Yeah.

27:09.955 --> 27:11.017
Is that one that went back?

27:11.639 --> 27:13.663
Yeah, it went quite way back.

27:13.683 --> 27:17.430
I mean, is it one that is now in Omaha?

27:17.510 --> 27:17.871
Yeah.

27:22.627 --> 27:25.051
I'm sorry.

27:25.071 --> 27:27.396
Say that again?

27:27.416 --> 27:30.962
I wonder how we're going to straighten the matter out.

27:30.982 --> 27:31.683
They really can't do it without me.

27:31.703 --> 27:37.173
I don't think they can do it satisfactorily without you, you know?

27:37.193 --> 27:37.253
No.

27:37.274 --> 27:39.478
So remains to be seen.

27:39.498 --> 27:46.390
It might be worth having some of these librarians, these professionals, suggest, you know, should you be convicted.

27:46.842 --> 27:50.387
Have them suggest, you know, let's put him to work on this.

27:50.528 --> 27:51.689
You know, he's not going to.

27:51.709 --> 27:52.811
I'd like to do that.

27:54.253 --> 27:55.796
And I intend to do that.

27:56.717 --> 28:04.168
But one thing I want, though, is I want things known about how the government acts with bears.

28:04.188 --> 28:05.470
I'm going to be honest.

28:05.490 --> 28:06.572
I'll be the first one.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.724
To put everything, all my cards on the table.

28:13.365 --> 28:16.290
And I will regardless, because that's the thing to do.

28:16.451 --> 28:21.219
But I would like it for the government to do the same.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.205
It should be interesting to look.

28:24.225 --> 28:24.325
Yeah.

28:24.777 --> 28:27.121
We know who the bad guys are, you know.

28:27.141 --> 28:28.924
This is a big house.

28:29.064 --> 28:32.589
Isn't this a nice house?

28:32.609 --> 28:33.050
Yeah.

28:33.070 --> 28:33.491
It's a big warm, too.

28:33.511 --> 28:34.212
How do you heat it?

28:34.232 --> 28:35.134
Oil?

28:35.154 --> 28:37.277
Oh, it's gas furnace.

28:37.297 --> 28:38.479
All right, Jimmy.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.482
Good luck, friend.

28:40.502 --> 28:41.323
God bless you.

28:42.065 --> 28:43.787
I hope you come out in a minute.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.490
Oh, God, I'm trying.

28:45.510 --> 28:46.191
Nice meeting you, sir.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.715
I wish you the best of luck, too.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.019
I wish you so.

28:51.039 --> 28:51.139
Okay.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.004
Nice to meet you.

28:55.024 --> 28:55.244
Bye, Jimmy.

28:55.264 --> 28:56.786
Don't get too bad.

28:56.806 --> 29:03.093
We'll be down in Tokyo.

29:05.436 --> 29:05.596
Okay.

29:05.616 --> 29:15.667
Tell him hi for me, will you?

29:15.687 --> 29:15.787
Okay.

29:15.807 --> 29:16.007
All right.

29:16.027 --> 29:16.167
I will.

29:16.187 --> 29:17.849
I got more mentally excited today than physically.

29:17.869 --> 29:18.510
I mean, mentally.

29:23.975 --> 29:29.562
So, how has your family done?

29:29.582 --> 29:31.224
Have they been supportive?

29:31.244 --> 29:32.826
Well, yeah, but it's awful hard on them.

29:32.846 --> 29:35.229
It's been a disgrace for them.

29:35.269 --> 29:38.994
I feel bad about them.

29:39.014 --> 29:39.434
I feel terrible.

29:39.454 --> 29:40.195
Do you have any siblings?

29:40.736 --> 29:41.257
No.

29:41.277 --> 29:43.519
No.

29:43.539 --> 29:45.141
Maybe someday I will.

29:45.161 --> 29:45.782
I don't know.

29:45.802 --> 29:50.468
But I just regard the people in the street as my siblings.

29:50.488 --> 29:51.770
And you have no brother's assistant?

29:51.790 --> 29:52.390
Oh, yeah.

29:52.410 --> 29:52.851
I have a...

29:53.422 --> 29:59.711
Our sister out in Seattle teaches and teaches Spanish.

29:59.731 --> 30:03.797
When you were on the road for these periods of time, did you stay in touch with your family?

30:03.817 --> 30:19.341
Yeah, and my father especially.

30:19.361 --> 30:21.043
Well, maybe I'll have a home come through here someday.

30:21.063 --> 30:21.984
It's a pretty little town, isn't it?

30:22.004 --> 30:22.365
It's kind of nice.

30:22.835 --> 30:26.140
There's the Wapaloe County Courthouse.

30:26.341 --> 30:27.923
W-A-P-P-A-L-O?

30:27.983 --> 30:34.073
Yeah, it used to have a tower on it, and that was taken off in the 40s, but there's Chief Wapaloe, the Indian.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.355
That's Chief Wapaloe.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.817
Yeah, that the town was named after.

30:37.859 --> 30:40.463
What, he's on the top of the building?

30:40.483 --> 30:41.084
Yeah, you see him.

30:41.124 --> 30:42.727
Oh, there he is, right on top of the building.

30:42.747 --> 30:46.953
Oh, that's a beautiful statue, isn't it?

30:46.973 --> 30:47.374
Yeah, a cast statue.

30:48.552 --> 30:49.954
So do you feel like an Irwin?

30:50.795 --> 30:52.638
No, I'm still a Minnepolitan.

30:54.981 --> 30:59.347
But maybe this is a place I can be welcome.

30:59.367 --> 31:00.408
What did you think when you saw this?

31:00.689 --> 31:01.710
Did you say, well, this is home?

31:02.792 --> 31:06.437
Well, I thought of the... I mean, was it central for you, too?

31:06.637 --> 31:18.053
Well, it's on the way to Texas, but I thought of it as the elderly neighbor lady coming over and bringing over a pie and...

31:18.320 --> 31:41.543
uh going down on the main street and talking with people about places or something like that but well the trouble is i was a little out of touch you see i couldn't go down to the main street and talk about incanabula can i get a soda and uh there was a somewhat of a cultural break here but

31:42.738 --> 32:08.998
we now have you see this town there's a lot of animosity here because these people are distressed because there's a high rate on this has some of the highest rate of unemployment there's economic hardship here there's not really any personal animosity and uh the people here it's way off the interstate it's kind of a community into itself most of these people have never been any place except for des moines and that so they don't have a real

32:09.299 --> 32:13.983
cosmopolitan air about them, and they're somewhat suspicious of outsiders at first.

32:14.564 --> 32:18.608
Well, now with this thing, I've become part of the town.

32:19.889 --> 32:24.353
I have lived through an ordeal, and the town has been part of it.

32:24.373 --> 32:29.097
So now I'm part of the community, so I sense an acceptance down here now, you know?

32:31.559 --> 32:33.942
That's nice.

32:33.962 --> 32:34.702
Test point 234.

32:35.043 --> 32:35.583
Did I recognize him?

32:35.663 --> 32:38.686
Did he say anything?

32:38.706 --> 32:38.766
No.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.854
I'm sorry, say that again?

32:43.035 --> 32:46.061
You know a lady who was from this town, her name was Edna Purva.

32:46.101 --> 32:46.643
Edna Purva was here.

32:46.663 --> 32:51.153
She lived right at the foot of, see this has been changed, this is Wapolo Street.

32:51.173 --> 32:54.420
And she lived right at the foot of Wapolo Street.

32:54.440 --> 33:00.754
And she lived here for, yeah, she lived here for like,

33:02.303 --> 33:10.776
five or six years and she writes of her experiences in the town in a book called Peculiar Treasures which was published in 1936.

33:12.359 --> 33:16.545
But unfortunately she had a rather bad experience here.

33:16.565 --> 33:19.890
In fact she had an experience quite similar to mine.

33:22.434 --> 33:29.205
Her father came here and he opened up a small

33:29.692 --> 33:32.456
Notion's store, you know.

33:32.476 --> 33:35.440
Notion's, you know, five and dime type store.

33:36.562 --> 33:42.610
And he was betrayed by an employee.

33:43.031 --> 33:49.320
His store manager was tiltering and ripping off his store.

33:50.561 --> 33:52.905
And he discovered that and he sued him.

33:53.766 --> 33:57.591
Well, this lawsuit went on and on and he lost the lawsuit.

33:57.611 --> 33:59.614
He lost most of his money.

34:00.202 --> 34:02.024
And he developed some health problems.

34:02.064 --> 34:08.870
He got some problems with his eyes, cataracts or something.

34:09.150 --> 34:15.797
And finally, they moved on to Appleton, Wisconsin, and things were better for her.

34:16.878 --> 34:19.360
And she writes of that chapter in her life.

34:19.380 --> 34:27.087
But she has bad feelings and sort of

34:30.155 --> 34:35.320
misgivings about the town, but yet she says she learned a lot from it.

34:35.621 --> 34:47.713
And she writes of coming back here in the night and seeing it, but it being too painful for her, and then driving back to Des Moines under a starlit knife, and the pain of Otumwa.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.556
But Otumwa didn't cause me any pain.

34:51.277 --> 34:55.521
In fact, I've gotten a relief from pain by being in Otumwa.

34:58.471 --> 35:04.239
like a fellow employee that betrayed me like Edna Ferber, but I brought him in.

35:04.279 --> 35:08.886
He wasn't, my pain was not derived from Otumwa.

35:09.647 --> 35:21.224
It was derived from elsewhere and my sort of solace or somewhat of a relief comes from going to Otumwa.

35:21.244 --> 35:26.071
I'm treated by and large in this bad situation nicely by the Otumwa.

35:26.191 --> 35:27.533
So in that way it's

35:28.053 --> 35:35.205
There's these similarities to the situation, but the conclusion of it isn't a negative thing like with Edna Ferber.

35:35.225 --> 35:36.707
But it's interesting, the parallel.

35:36.988 --> 35:40.173
You ought to read that chapter in her book, Peculiar Treasures, sometime.

35:40.193 --> 35:43.378
Had you read this prior to your... Yeah, prior to it, yeah.

35:47.037 --> 35:49.660
Yeah, you know, she wrote Showboat.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.581
Oh, she's famous.

35:50.661 --> 35:50.821
Yeah.

35:50.941 --> 35:54.225
Well, you know who, you know, Showboat, wasn't it, Jerome Curran?

35:54.265 --> 35:54.905
Yeah.

35:54.925 --> 35:56.027
He had quite a library.

35:56.127 --> 35:57.228
He's one of a great collectors.

35:57.248 --> 35:57.868
Yeah, I know he was.

35:58.149 --> 36:01.773
In fact, the Curran sale in the 20s, 29, was the highlight.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.053
That's right.

36:02.093 --> 36:03.314
A book price.

36:03.334 --> 36:07.399
Well, let me tell you, I have a chapter.

36:07.539 --> 36:09.060
You own an association company?

36:09.321 --> 36:12.404
Yeah, I have some interesting association companies.

36:12.424 --> 36:13.865
You can't tell me about any of them now?

36:14.326 --> 36:15.407
Well,

36:17.564 --> 36:26.613
Yeah, you know, I don't even know if they were... I had three, four presidential copies of books.

36:27.133 --> 36:29.676
I had a book I bought in Galena, Illinois.

36:30.537 --> 36:33.540
It was Heath's counterfeit detector.

36:33.560 --> 36:44.871
And Lieben Heath, shortly after the Civil War, was the only person authorized by the government to use government plates to strike

36:45.205 --> 36:55.317
plates in the book, actual plates of money, and this book was sold or distributed to banks to look for counterfeit bank notes.

36:55.457 --> 36:55.897
No kidding.

36:56.438 --> 37:01.063
And it's quite a collectible item numismatically as well as in other aspects.

37:01.103 --> 37:03.346
Now the title of the book again?

37:03.366 --> 37:05.028
Lieben Heath is the author.

37:05.909 --> 37:07.190
Can you spell it?

37:07.390 --> 37:08.091
H-E-A-T-H.

37:08.251 --> 37:09.112
What's your first name?

37:09.132 --> 37:09.553
Lieben.

37:11.015 --> 37:12.076
Lieben, L-I-E-B?

37:12.096 --> 37:13.137
No, or Leben.

37:13.673 --> 37:14.755
L-E-B-E-N.

37:14.835 --> 37:23.747
And I in Galena, Illinois, was in a shop and they told me about an old man that sort of dealt books out of his house.

37:24.268 --> 37:25.990
And he had a full leather copy.

37:27.633 --> 37:29.455
It came out in a green cloth.

37:29.856 --> 37:37.367
And he had a full leather copy that was, it said, in gold tooling, to our president, U.S.

37:37.427 --> 37:37.847
Grant.

37:38.608 --> 37:42.634
And Grant was president in 1868 at the time the book was published.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.159
That was one.

37:44.740 --> 37:53.691
I had a book, a view book of Council Bluffs, Iowa, that was given to Grover Cleveland.

37:53.791 --> 37:54.792
It's stamped in there.

37:54.812 --> 37:59.218
Probably he went through an entourage or something, and it was presented when he stopped in the city.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.641
Then I had a view book of St.

38:01.661 --> 38:01.922
Paul.

38:01.942 --> 38:03.844
Where did you get that?

38:03.864 --> 38:06.267
I don't remember.

38:06.307 --> 38:07.128
I didn't have to look at it.

38:07.148 --> 38:12.896
Do you think it was one acquired on your journeys?

38:12.916 --> 38:13.296
I...

38:13.799 --> 38:14.781
I don't know.

38:16.383 --> 38:19.248
Possibly.

38:19.268 --> 38:21.052
Do you think it's one that's been confiscated?

38:21.753 --> 38:25.820
Well, they confiscated all my books.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.124
I don't know if it's been claimed or not.

38:30.428 --> 38:32.752
I mean, is it one that's likely to be claimed by any institution?

38:32.832 --> 38:35.356
I don't think so.

38:35.457 --> 38:38.642
Now, what's the most you ever spent personally for a book?

38:43.060 --> 38:43.681
That's a fair question.

38:43.861 --> 38:47.864
Well, there was one I tried to buy, but it was gone by the time I got there.

38:47.884 --> 38:53.950
I tried to buy a copy of Wandusky by Tuttle, and it's in-house.

38:54.010 --> 38:56.092
It's a double A listing in-house.

38:56.492 --> 38:56.732
Spell it.

38:57.473 --> 38:59.315
W-A-M-D-U-S-K-I.

38:59.335 --> 39:00.176
What is it?

39:01.257 --> 39:06.581
It's a record of a private duck hunting excursion to North Dakota.

39:07.582 --> 39:12.747
It was published by a fellow named Tuttle, who was a historian of Minneapolis.

39:12.895 --> 39:16.638
He published like a three-volume set, Tuttle's History of Minneapolis.

39:17.339 --> 39:22.043
And I wanted it because there were only 25 copies issued.

39:22.103 --> 39:29.630
And I guess from the description is one of those that they pasted in photos of the surrounding countryside.

39:29.670 --> 39:36.035
But it's so early that it's an early travel narrative of North Dakota, and it's a desirable Americana item.

39:36.075 --> 39:38.197
Well, Jenkins had it for $500.

39:38.958 --> 39:41.620
And I tried to get it, but I was too late.

39:42.022 --> 39:44.164
Would that have been the most you'd ever paid for a book?

39:44.184 --> 39:45.105
That would have been, yeah.

39:46.046 --> 39:49.831
And what is the most you have ever paid, do you think?

39:49.851 --> 39:50.371
I don't know.

39:50.391 --> 39:52.153
I bought them in quantities.

39:52.173 --> 39:52.894
I suppose $200, $300.

39:53.034 --> 40:02.325
I mean, the idea of spending, say, $1,000 for a book, would it be totally alien to you?

40:02.345 --> 40:05.848
No, not for the right book.

40:05.888 --> 40:09.092
The type of book I'd spend that kind of money on would be, oh, a

40:09.443 --> 40:10.925
trade catalog from the St.

40:11.085 --> 40:23.120
Paul Art Glass Company or something I'm doing research in that may not necessarily be worth that, but it'd be of value to me to document some of my other architectural things.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.022
Now documenting, were you writing?

40:25.483 --> 40:26.404
Were you writing things down?

40:26.444 --> 40:31.990
Well, I was chronicalizing them in my mind, and maybe eventually I would like to write.

40:32.011 --> 40:34.894
What would you like to have written?

40:36.595 --> 40:47.608
Well, I have a book and manuscript that I hadn't put the text in, but I had a collection of over 700 different pre-1930 Minneapolis and St.

40:47.628 --> 40:48.509
Paul postcards.

40:49.611 --> 40:54.857
And I was going to use them as views illustrating the city.

40:54.877 --> 41:00.083
And I was going to write about the history of the buildings and the history of the scenes in there.

41:00.744 --> 41:04.729
Like, I'd have Hennepin Avenue, and I'd have a page of, like,

41:05.182 --> 41:17.256
or two pages of 1900 cards, like Seventh and Hennepin, 1900, then 1910, then 1920, of the same views, so you could follow the change in architecture.

41:17.276 --> 41:31.392
And then I had a section in there of public buildings, city halls and so forth, office buildings, churches, residences, and then views of schools.

41:32.772 --> 41:55.995
uh parks and so forth i had all that manuscript and you know i've been collecting twin city cars for 20 years and i grabbed that do you think you'd like to write at some point possibly i really don't know how to build this picture that you gave today shows skill and talent thank you and you love architecture has you ever thought of being an architect

41:56.465 --> 42:03.232
Well, I'd like to be an architectural historian or consultant, but I don't know if I could stand the regimentation of going to school.

42:03.312 --> 42:06.215
I've always felt I had a bad time in school.

42:06.235 --> 42:14.423
I've always felt I'd be looked down on and made fun of by the fellow students.

42:14.443 --> 42:16.184
But then again, I don't know if I would.

42:16.204 --> 42:20.449
I like scholars, but I've just always felt out of place.

42:20.469 --> 42:21.850
Do you consider yourself a scholar?

42:24.132 --> 42:24.953
Not really.

42:25.405 --> 42:29.571
Well, if you do research, what is astrology?

42:29.591 --> 42:35.480
Did you get any kind of visceral pleasure when you went into some of these institutions and you were accepted as an academic mission?

42:35.500 --> 42:35.920
Yeah.

42:35.980 --> 42:36.862
Oh, yeah, I did.

42:36.882 --> 42:38.063
I did, yeah.

42:38.103 --> 42:39.125
What did you feel?

42:39.145 --> 42:42.089
I was surprised that I was accepted.

42:42.109 --> 42:42.630
I mean, you're articulate.

42:43.011 --> 42:44.312
You certainly have a focus.

42:44.352 --> 42:47.317
Yeah, but I barely made it through high school.

42:51.343 --> 42:52.004
You know?

42:52.224 --> 42:52.324
Yeah.

42:53.688 --> 42:54.889
But I've done a lot of reading.

42:55.029 --> 43:03.318
All my educations come from reading and talking to people and observing what's around me and speculating and analyzing things.

43:12.187 --> 43:12.948
Absolutely.

43:13.048 --> 43:22.378
I'm going to have to to take the fear out of the academic community.

43:23.287 --> 43:30.959
They've suffered somewhat of an injustice, and I owe it to them, but I think they're more scared than they should be.

43:31.039 --> 43:35.025
Okay, well, I think that my book is the place to do it, you know.

43:35.606 --> 43:35.747
Yeah.

43:35.767 --> 43:36.508
Don't you think so?

43:37.189 --> 43:37.930
That'd be all right.

43:38.231 --> 43:40.694
I mean, you are dealing with a fellow bibliophile.

43:40.835 --> 43:40.935
Yeah.

43:42.097 --> 43:46.423
I am writing about book collecting and book collectors.

43:46.443 --> 43:47.205
Yeah.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.308
I've got a contract with a major publisher.

43:49.448 --> 43:49.969
Yeah.

43:50.101 --> 43:51.804
So this is nothing speculative.

43:51.824 --> 43:54.728
We're going to have a book out next year.

43:54.748 --> 44:08.329
And maybe if this thing goes to the jury prior... Ray Cornell did tell me, by the way, that as soon as this thing goes to the jury, you don't even have to be a verdict, that you're free to talk to me about anything you want.

44:10.739 --> 44:13.683
Well, it's hard to sit there in Des Moines and do it.

44:13.724 --> 44:18.891
Really, I feel better when I'm out on the highway like this with my friends.

44:19.112 --> 44:23.158
You've got me back tonight in my life, you know.

44:24.700 --> 44:29.567
I go back to Des Moines and I die again, you know, or I go back to that house without my stuff.

44:31.711 --> 44:32.752
I really feel good.

44:32.772 --> 44:34.715
You feel violated when you went to the house?

44:35.456 --> 44:36.578
Yeah, yeah.

44:37.857 --> 44:40.140
I mean, like it's a rape almost, isn't it?

44:40.781 --> 44:41.542
Well, yeah.

44:41.602 --> 44:43.144
This man has brutalized your house.

44:43.164 --> 44:45.047
Yeah, yeah.

44:45.067 --> 44:46.790
I'm sorry, you were going to say they took what?

44:46.830 --> 44:50.555
Yeah, they took the chandeliers and the windows.

44:52.417 --> 44:55.782
They didn't care, you know.

44:55.802 --> 44:59.207
And he didn't care, especially.

45:02.231 --> 45:07.138
I think there could have been a gentler way to resolve this man.

45:08.047 --> 45:10.289
But I shouldn't feel sorry for myself.

45:10.309 --> 45:17.998
I realize I've transgressed on some other people, and I'm going to have to try to make it right somehow.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.204
I don't want Mr. Magoo to be afraid to shake my hand or anything.

45:23.224 --> 45:26.507
I don't want anybody afraid of me.

45:26.607 --> 45:29.470
That does, yeah.

45:29.510 --> 45:31.533
Mr. Magoo is special.

45:34.195 --> 45:34.296
Yeah.

45:34.316 --> 45:36.418
Is that the first time you saw him?

45:36.438 --> 45:36.518
Yep.

45:40.396 --> 45:42.779
Where did you find his ID?

45:43.520 --> 45:51.552
I was just walking out the door, and it was laying on the circulation desk.

45:51.772 --> 45:55.217
And you didn't give a... You gave the thought what?

45:55.237 --> 45:57.400
I mean, how quickly did the thought go through your mind?

45:58.782 --> 45:59.162
Instantly.

46:01.425 --> 46:06.172
And I looked at that, and I said, you know, I understand how things are made in that.

46:06.192 --> 46:09.036
And I said, oh, you know.

46:11.159 --> 46:12.680
And this was about, what, 87?

46:12.700 --> 46:13.701
No, no, no, 80.

46:15.023 --> 46:19.087
So this did elevate the collection to a new level, didn't it?

46:19.107 --> 46:28.636
Well, it took me a while to get, I didn't want to do it until I could do it right.

46:28.656 --> 46:36.964
I wanted to get alternate types of ID, and I couldn't do it within the state, so I had to, you know, I could throw out on the trial, go out to California.

46:38.412 --> 46:47.580
But if I'd have known the similarities of our background and the jeopardy you could possibly have put him in, I wouldn't have done him.

46:47.741 --> 46:52.825
God, it's terrible.

46:52.945 --> 46:56.549
I just couldn't believe it.

46:56.569 --> 46:56.669
Yeah?

46:56.689 --> 47:01.914
Well, my biggest threat of all is I'll be in jail and my father will leave me.

47:03.896 --> 47:05.517
He might pass away.

47:07.150 --> 47:08.871
Are you close to your father?

47:08.972 --> 47:09.252
Very close.

47:10.012 --> 47:16.198
I'm the closest person to him in his life and him to me.

47:16.218 --> 47:25.846
See, I'm like my father's son and brother because his mother was the closest woman in my life as well as his.

47:27.347 --> 47:28.348
Your grandmother?

47:28.368 --> 47:29.109
Yeah.

47:29.129 --> 47:34.573
You were very close to your grandmother?

47:34.593 --> 47:34.933
Very close, yeah.

47:34.954 --> 47:36.735
Do you think that this is for him at all?

47:37.087 --> 47:38.389
Oh, dreadful.

47:38.409 --> 47:40.972
You know, I've seen his quotes in the newspaper.

47:40.992 --> 47:42.434
He is very supportive of you.

47:42.454 --> 47:42.894
Yes, he is.

47:42.914 --> 47:44.676
He sounds like he's a very loving father.

47:44.696 --> 47:46.118
He is.

47:46.138 --> 47:48.481
I'll introduce you to him if you want to be here.

47:48.501 --> 47:49.182
I'd like that.

47:49.662 --> 47:51.505
I know Ray Cornell told me.

47:51.525 --> 47:53.507
I asked him prior to this.

47:53.607 --> 47:56.411
I said, do you think I can talk to Dr. Blumberg?

47:56.431 --> 47:57.412
And he said, yeah, I think so.

47:57.432 --> 47:59.014
Maybe tomorrow, even.

47:59.034 --> 48:00.956
It's all right with you.

48:00.976 --> 48:02.819
You don't mind.

48:02.839 --> 48:03.039
No.

48:03.099 --> 48:06.503
Maybe I think it'd be better if I...

48:07.242 --> 48:16.795
If you weren't there while I interviewed him, what do you think?

48:16.815 --> 48:17.155
It's up to you.

48:17.175 --> 48:18.918
I don't have anything to hide.

48:18.938 --> 48:21.201
I know, but I think maybe I could talk a little more frankly with him.

48:21.221 --> 48:25.847
You know, I wouldn't want you to feel embarrassed by anything, you know?

48:25.867 --> 48:31.174
Well, we'll see what's playing by him, right?

48:31.194 --> 48:31.394
Yeah.

48:31.475 --> 48:36.321
I want you to spend the day living the way I live with the type of people I associate with.

48:37.313 --> 48:45.506
You know, I don't think these people that talk about me can understand the feeling, like somebody who's with me, you know.

48:45.526 --> 48:46.548
You know the roads, huh?

48:46.988 --> 48:47.669
Oh, yeah.

48:47.690 --> 48:48.891
You love the orphan drive.

48:49.352 --> 48:50.414
Oh, yeah.

48:50.434 --> 48:53.459
And stop and meet people in junk shops.

48:54.601 --> 48:55.362
I can just imagine.

48:55.382 --> 48:55.542
Explore.

48:56.905 --> 48:59.608
Oh, yeah, I went from Maine to California, you know.

48:59.769 --> 49:02.372
I could drive all the way back to Brimfield without a map.

49:03.874 --> 49:07.018
You know, have you been through all the contiguous 48?

49:07.038 --> 49:14.928
Yeah, I haven't been in Alabama or too much down in that, but I've been through, yeah.

49:15.209 --> 49:18.953
But, like, when I go across New York to Brimfield, I take Route 20.

49:19.034 --> 49:21.377
I don't take the New York Thruway.

49:21.397 --> 49:23.579
I stop in all those little towns along the way.

49:23.599 --> 49:25.562
It takes me three days to cross New York State.

49:26.150 --> 49:32.822
And I get to visiting with people and into people's homes.

49:32.902 --> 49:35.467
Do you have a girlfriend at all, or you're pretty much of a loner?

49:36.469 --> 49:37.551
Pretty much of a loner.

49:39.895 --> 49:48.951
I've had some friends, but in a way I kind of mistrust women because my mother's up across my head, you know.

49:55.968 --> 50:02.092
Well, I'm excited and thrilled on the one hand, and I'm apprehensive for you on the other.

50:02.112 --> 50:04.341
Oh, I'm apprehensive too.

50:04.675 --> 50:30.919
Oh, you like to paint, huh?

50:30.899 --> 50:33.535
I'm a real artist, man.

50:33.555 --> 50:36.775
See, that's why my uncle, he does.

50:37.784 --> 50:40.086
Uncle does tattoos?

50:40.106 --> 50:40.486
Yeah.

50:40.506 --> 50:41.767
Do you have tattoos?

50:41.787 --> 50:44.009
How old are you?

50:44.029 --> 50:44.950
16.

50:44.970 --> 50:45.030
16.

50:45.050 --> 50:46.772
I do something like that one, though.

50:46.812 --> 50:48.974
But see, he's got this wizard on his back.

50:49.114 --> 50:50.355
Oh, yeah.

50:50.375 --> 50:53.398
And he ain't got all the way to be able to see.

50:53.418 --> 50:54.579
He's a pretty good artist.

50:54.599 --> 50:57.441
I mean, I love meetings up on the walls in the apartment.

50:57.461 --> 50:57.902
Have you seen them?

50:57.922 --> 51:00.824
No, you ought to see the Victorian houses I draw on that.

51:01.825 --> 51:04.007
But I love painting.

51:04.027 --> 51:04.167
Yeah.

51:04.187 --> 51:07.690
Art and works is like my hobbies.

51:07.670 --> 51:16.005
Ackerman Museum.

51:16.025 --> 51:20.153
Mr. Ackerman was a banker, small-town banker.

51:20.353 --> 51:23.318
He died in his estate.

51:23.338 --> 51:32.074
Kept that as sort of a... That's an old, small-town Midwestern Iowa bank that's still the way it is.

51:33.404 --> 51:34.906
I've never seen it open.

51:34.926 --> 51:36.589
Have you ever been in it?

51:36.869 --> 51:38.091
No, I've looked in the windows.

51:38.171 --> 51:42.017
I never found it open.

51:42.037 --> 51:43.178
Drying up, you know.

51:43.859 --> 51:45.101
There's no work.

51:45.381 --> 51:46.844
There's a piece in the paper this morning.

51:46.924 --> 51:49.427
It says that the population isn't floating.

51:49.588 --> 51:53.994
It's all kind of pulling into the... It's sort of sad to see, you know.

51:55.536 --> 52:01.605
But that's sort of a relic of the past, of a commercial...

52:02.075 --> 52:04.277
enterprising small Iowa town.

52:04.297 --> 52:07.840
It'd be nice to go and see that someday.

52:07.860 --> 52:09.922
Sure, and I love the museum too.

52:09.942 --> 52:11.924
Yeah, I do too.

52:11.944 --> 52:13.265
There's a museum up in St.

52:13.285 --> 52:16.688
Helena, the Silverado Museum, California.

52:16.708 --> 52:17.208
Oh.

52:17.268 --> 52:18.810
Actually, a great love museum.

52:18.830 --> 52:21.112
Yeah, yeah, I had the first edition of that.

52:21.392 --> 52:22.052
Is that right?

52:22.072 --> 52:22.172
Yeah.

52:23.133 --> 52:24.635
I think it was published in London, wasn't it?

52:24.655 --> 52:25.295
It was, yeah.

52:25.315 --> 52:28.918
Yeah, it had a green cloth cover.

52:28.938 --> 52:30.900
I had an uncut edition of that.

52:40.904 --> 52:43.956
Sam, what's his name?

52:44.017 --> 52:44.805
How do you spell it?

52:53.543 --> 53:07.302
Boy, I never thought I'd get down to a tender on this trip, so I knew you.

53:07.322 --> 53:07.623
Oh, tough.

53:07.643 --> 53:07.843
Boy, yeah.

53:07.863 --> 53:08.885
Steve Hunt.

53:08.905 --> 53:09.305
I really enjoyed it.

53:09.325 --> 53:11.508
Thank you very much.

53:11.528 --> 53:11.969
Thanks for the appeal.

53:11.989 --> 53:13.731
Enjoy the company ourselves, at least.

53:13.751 --> 53:14.252
Yep.

53:15.987 --> 53:38.321
Someday maybe I can take these islands out east and experience the culture out there.

53:38.341 --> 53:38.962
Oh, I've seen it.

53:39.022 --> 53:41.185
I took the Baja.

53:42.042 --> 53:48.010
I drove the Baja Petitiano right down to the tip, Cabo San Lucas.

53:48.031 --> 53:57.524
And I used to go out to California with my truck, and I found an old 1950 Chevy on a ranch in Amarillo.

53:58.005 --> 54:00.248
And it had a rebuilt motor.

54:00.328 --> 54:02.651
And I'd pull it behind there with a tow bar.

54:03.512 --> 54:07.398
And I'd park my truck in a RV rent, a storage place.

54:08.159 --> 54:11.644
And I was in Los Angeles during the winter.

54:11.911 --> 54:18.821
I wanted to go to the beach and see the ocean without having to park three blocks away and all the crowds.

54:18.841 --> 54:22.868
So I said, I'm going to keep going south until it's nothing but me and the ocean.

54:22.888 --> 54:23.368
And I did.

54:23.428 --> 54:26.193
I got down to Ensenada, and there were still people.

54:26.213 --> 54:29.598
And then I made it down to Guerrero Negro.

54:31.080 --> 54:32.682
And they have the salt mines there.

54:33.624 --> 54:39.032
And then Rosarito and

54:42.134 --> 54:46.610
mula hay, and loretto.

54:46.972 --> 54:52.532
You know, Baja California, or lower California, was older than

54:53.390 --> 54:55.393
Northern California.

54:55.694 --> 54:59.560
And I wanted to see California as it was before the Anglos got there.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.023
And they had what was called the El Camino Real.

55:02.204 --> 55:04.547
I spread three years of California.

55:04.567 --> 55:05.649
El Camino Real.

55:05.769 --> 55:08.333
Well, I took the old part of that.

55:08.353 --> 55:09.074
In the Becerra.

55:09.335 --> 55:09.855
Yeah.

55:10.116 --> 55:10.997
Yeah.

55:11.057 --> 55:11.658
Yeah.

55:11.678 --> 55:12.920
The Cadre.

55:12.940 --> 55:13.241
Yeah.

55:13.661 --> 55:19.691
Well, I took that in a 1950 Chevy with David Olson.

55:19.711 --> 55:19.971
And, uh,

55:20.693 --> 55:22.975
That's about 800, 900 miles down there.

55:23.035 --> 55:29.561
And the car was all faded out and that, and an old three-speed on the column, you know.

55:31.202 --> 55:37.968
Like, if you go down to Mexico in this, you stand out, but you go down in an old 30-year-old faded out car.

55:38.188 --> 55:40.990
Yeah, I didn't want to go to Mexico in anything like this.

55:41.010 --> 55:42.452
I didn't even have to lock the doors.

55:42.472 --> 55:44.954
And I'd come in and do a gas station.

55:44.994 --> 55:48.477
People would come up and talk in English, or excuse me, in Spanish.

55:48.897 --> 55:49.958
I didn't understand it.

55:50.174 --> 55:53.939
And they'd look at me like I'd have old clothes, and I had to take a bath.

55:53.959 --> 56:00.068
And they'd look at me, and they'd think, well, you're an American, but what happened?

56:00.649 --> 56:05.335
Because in some of these communities, I got away from the touristes.

56:05.996 --> 56:11.283
And I could sense kind of they didn't care for the touristes.

56:11.424 --> 56:12.785
And I'll give you an example of that.

56:12.846 --> 56:16.851
I was in one of those towns, and these gas stations sometimes are 70, 80 miles apart.

56:16.871 --> 56:17.612
It's real fair.

56:18.473 --> 56:19.675
And a fellow pulled in.

56:20.431 --> 56:21.372
with a big RV.

56:22.254 --> 56:24.677
And all the gas stations there, they're called Pemex.

56:25.419 --> 56:29.084
And they're government owned and the people are government employees, you know.

56:29.725 --> 56:34.632
And this guy, I figured he had like 100 or 150 gallon capacity on that thing.

56:34.673 --> 56:42.104
I know he'd filled up in like National City or in the United States border and he just got down there and he was out of gas.

56:42.124 --> 56:43.406
Well, I've been down there a month.

56:43.506 --> 56:44.307
I was heading north.

56:44.327 --> 56:47.552
Well, their gas is metric and it's in pesos.

56:48.072 --> 56:51.517
And I always converted my money into pesos and paid them their money.

56:51.557 --> 56:54.522
Well, he gets down there and the guy fills it up.

56:56.545 --> 57:01.112
And it was liters, and I don't know, it was five liters to a gallon or something.

57:01.132 --> 57:05.058
But this guy, it takes a while to, you've got to convert twice.

57:05.078 --> 57:08.684
You've got to convert into metric, and then you've got to convert the metric price into pesos.

57:08.704 --> 57:10.787
It was two conversions.

57:10.807 --> 57:15.835
Well, I would know, after being there a month, just exactly how much gas

57:16.405 --> 57:21.913
you know, how much 10 gallons of gas would be in liters and in American money or Mexican money.

57:21.933 --> 57:33.990
Well, this guy didn't have enough Mexican money, and he had to pay part of an American, and this was just a gas station kind of in a little village, and I knew he was going to have trouble converting it, if he will.

57:34.932 --> 57:42.042
So he started arguing with the guy that he was getting ripped off because it comes to something like,

57:42.646 --> 57:54.000
The peso was $2,300 to the dollar, and it was something like 100,000 pesos, or, you know, it seemed like a high price, but I figured it out.

57:54.020 --> 57:57.645
He was giving him a fair price, and they got in an argument about it.

57:58.906 --> 58:01.990
And I went up and told the guy, I says, hey, you know, you're not being cheated.

58:02.010 --> 58:03.292
And he says, well, I don't have any.

58:04.594 --> 58:09.019
I got to get my wife and get some American money, and there isn't a currency exchange.

58:09.039 --> 58:12.163
And I says, just go in and pay it.

58:13.055 --> 58:17.321
see the attendant was upset with this.

58:17.661 --> 58:20.886
He knew that his honesty, his integrity, the challenge.

58:21.246 --> 58:23.369
He come up to me and he said something in Spanish.

58:23.389 --> 58:26.894
He looked over to him, probably some cuss word, and they said, Gringo.

58:26.914 --> 58:28.676
And I said, well, fill her up.

58:28.716 --> 58:34.084
And he looked like, you're one of them too, but you're not.

58:34.645 --> 58:42.235
And I just, I can't speak Spanish, but sometimes I get in conversations for

58:42.603 --> 58:48.835
15-20 minutes with people down there and you could communicate but yet not know the language, you know?

58:50.197 --> 58:54.966
And they'd ask where I was from and I'd tell them Minnesota but they didn't understand.

58:55.026 --> 59:00.056
I'd just say Canada and right away they knew I was from the northern part of the United States and I spoke English.

59:00.496 --> 59:06.147
But the fact that I didn't have my tourist outfit and my camera and

59:06.920 --> 59:16.553
that I look like those people, driving a vehicle much like them, and living much the same lifestyle, I never sensed any how stupid down there.

59:16.974 --> 59:21.600
How did you feel about these characterizations that you're in Kemp?

59:21.620 --> 59:26.307
You didn't look like Kemp to be a little more.

59:26.327 --> 59:27.829
Is there anything you don't want to talk about?

59:28.470 --> 59:30.853
Oh, I don't know.

59:30.953 --> 59:33.116
I think it's kind of degrading.

59:33.136 --> 59:33.457
It is degrading.

59:33.477 --> 59:35.239
Yeah, I think it is.

59:37.852 --> 59:38.693
I think it is.

59:38.733 --> 59:48.989
And I'm worried that if I get thrown in the green bin, they're going to try to take my soul away, you know.

59:49.009 --> 01:00:01.327
You know, all I got to do is just think a little bit more about what I do and make sure my actions don't hurt or upset people.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:05.293
And that's that, you know.

01:00:10.893 --> 01:00:14.478
But I don't know what they're going to use to judge.

01:00:14.538 --> 01:00:19.466
I usually ask these psychiatrists questions about things, you know.

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:22.010
Like what?

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:25.395
Oh, they ask me weird questions, so I ask them stuff back.

01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:38.875
Like why I'd go in that dumpster and so forth when I'd have a pound of gold on me.

01:00:39.293 --> 01:00:41.736
You don't need to dig in dumpsters.

01:00:41.756 --> 01:00:45.401
Well, yes, you do, but we rescued the treasure today.

01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:51.250
A book that would have been... That's great.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.450
Yeah.

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:55.135
I always like that saying, you want to say, you want to say, you want to say, you want to say it's garbage, it's garbage, it's treasure.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:56.297
That's sure true, Adam.

01:00:57.118 --> 01:00:59.641
That's sure true.

01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:01.564
Do you carry gold like that?

01:01:01.664 --> 01:01:06.010
Well, I used to when I'd come up from Texas, because, you see, I was...

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:15.482
I had a storage problem, and I was trying to, you know, I got an awful lot of stuff, and I was trying to cut down on the quantity of stuff that I had.

01:01:16.783 --> 01:01:23.430
And I was selling that, but I wanted to keep it in some sort of collectible form.

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:34.461
So I knew people down in the southwest, they're having economic trouble there, that would, coin dealers and that, that would sell me

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:39.017
not high-grade coins, but circulated coins that about melt.

01:01:39.037 --> 01:01:44.425
Because, you see, expensive coins for a coin dealer, that don't pay the rent.

01:01:44.706 --> 01:01:49.854
You know, $20 gold piece for $400, people aren't going to come in and buy that.

01:01:50.095 --> 01:01:58.288
You know, you buy a $20 gold piece, let's say you pay $3.60, you're going to sit there for months before you get $4.50 out of it.

01:01:58.471 --> 01:01:59.593
They're not a quick turnover.

01:01:59.613 --> 01:02:06.166
It's better to buy wheat pennies at two cents a piece and sell them for a nickel, or buffalo nickels at a quarter and sell them for 50 cents.

01:02:06.908 --> 01:02:13.020
You're going to have more profit margin or good collection.
