WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:04.651
Okay, we're with Walter.

00:05.051 --> 00:05.813
Walter Biller.

00:05.833 --> 00:06.213
Biller.

00:06.313 --> 00:07.115
Spell your name for me.

00:07.615 --> 00:08.957
B-I-L-L-E-R.

00:09.017 --> 00:09.939
Do you use a little initial?

00:10.560 --> 00:10.740
No.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.082
Okay.

00:12.102 --> 00:17.169
So we're in Walter's spectacular apartment.

00:17.570 --> 00:18.231
What do you call it?

00:18.271 --> 00:19.914
We call it a Haight flat.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.155
Is that what it is?

00:21.316 --> 00:24.260
It's a 1905 Edwardian Haight-Ashbury flat.

00:24.280 --> 00:24.500
Oh, great.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.081
And guess what?

00:25.141 --> 00:26.924
There's books, man, all over the place.

00:26.964 --> 00:27.625
Look at this.

00:27.976 --> 00:31.319
I'm going to take a picture of you if you don't mind.

00:31.379 --> 00:35.704
There's more books in here than I ever want to think about moving out of here.

00:35.744 --> 00:36.384
Okay, cool.

00:36.424 --> 00:43.651
So you're about to play for me a... This was a tape of World News on CNN.

00:43.771 --> 00:46.094
I think it was last November.

00:46.174 --> 00:47.355
I'm not exactly sure of the date.

00:48.476 --> 00:55.203
But it was following the opening of the New York Times at the point we were able to start to get some major news.

00:55.343 --> 00:55.603
Okay.

00:55.921 --> 00:58.144
Okay, anytime.

00:58.585 --> 01:00.748
And I'm just going to get the audio of this.

01:01.389 --> 01:02.831
I'll put this close to the speaker.

01:03.311 --> 01:04.653
And that's it.

01:06.055 --> 01:13.285
The opening of the San Francisco Library this year was heralded as the coming of a new age for libraries.

01:13.305 --> 01:17.111
But the new design has one group of book lovers on the rampage.

01:17.491 --> 01:18.773
Here are the books.

01:19.073 --> 01:29.429
There are atriums and there are spaces in the floor that go up five stories and there's nowhere for books.

01:29.449 --> 01:34.317
It has 9.1 miles more shelf space than the old library.

01:34.437 --> 01:39.865
It has more shelf space on the open floor proportionally than the old library did.

01:40.807 --> 01:42.669
Is it enough shelf space?

01:43.591 --> 01:44.372
Maybe not.

01:44.723 --> 01:51.052
Definitely not, say critics, making way for the new that talks about the old, thousands of old books.

01:51.652 --> 01:57.621
Library officials say they don't know for sure how many, but think it was around 20,000 from the old building.

01:57.641 --> 02:05.792
A current New Yorker article called it the great book purge, claiming more than 100,000 rare and one-of-a-kind books for help to be dumped.

02:05.812 --> 02:13.262
Local historian and library buff Walter Biller claims to have a computer list of thousands of books that were dumped, many irreplaceable.

02:13.478 --> 02:22.957
I believe 19,000 of them were last copy, which is generally something that are, you know, books that are scrutinized before they discard it.

02:23.258 --> 02:29.530
Library officials say the number was much smaller and admit maybe there were some volumes that should have been kept.

02:29.510 --> 02:34.941
As people were preparing for the move, that those books weren't reviewed.

02:35.362 --> 02:37.667
They weren't sent out for review.

02:37.968 --> 02:40.493
It was a very, very brief period of time.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.802
Library officials say 430,000 new books were added.

02:45.018 --> 02:54.550
As charges and counter charges fly, three times as many visitors stream through the doors of the new library, an indication that some book lovers welcome the change.

02:54.791 --> 03:03.121
It's a debate about the future of libraries and in many ways a debate about technology versus the old-fashioned version of the library.

03:03.522 --> 03:08.468
Critics say computers belong in the library, but so do different treasures of the past.

03:09.129 --> 03:13.675
I think the library in essence has become a showcase for high technology.

03:14.060 --> 03:18.790
at great expense to the book collections and the print collections.

03:19.030 --> 03:23.620
A debate about knowledge, the way it's kept, and the way it's tapped on.

03:24.321 --> 03:26.546
Rusty Dornan, CNN, San Francisco.

03:27.708 --> 03:34.262
The White House Gardens are famous for their spring area public.

03:40.199 --> 03:47.838
If you're looking for a book, the library is a good place to go, but you might have trouble with the plush grand new San Francisco main library.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.605
They've got a cost of $135 million.

03:50.746 --> 03:54.816
It has come under attack for paying more attention to architecture than books.

03:55.218 --> 03:58.482
An in-house survey leaks to the media made things look pretty bad.

03:58.522 --> 04:02.787
Officials called that survey flawed, so we decided to see for ourselves.

04:03.368 --> 04:13.079
I have a list of books, some classics, some popular fiction, some children, some obscure.

04:13.299 --> 04:15.722
I wanted to check out just how many I could check out.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.906
I was directed to the online computer directory.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.688
The old card catalog is gone.

04:20.988 --> 04:21.909
All right, let's start.

04:22.230 --> 04:23.972
Let's start with the author.

04:23.992 --> 04:24.212
First book.

04:26.926 --> 04:30.530
Simpson O.J.

04:31.752 --> 04:36.157
I want to tell you this is working.

04:36.317 --> 04:36.657
Huh.

04:36.677 --> 04:43.345
The search for an author has not located any titles in the database.

04:43.365 --> 04:44.967
Let's see.

04:44.987 --> 04:45.247
Plato.

04:45.267 --> 04:46.188
L-A-T-O.

04:46.208 --> 04:50.593
Oh, they have 46 Plato books.

04:50.693 --> 04:52.315
Okay.

04:52.735 --> 04:54.958
So it's not here.

04:55.883 --> 05:03.992
And we have the trucks that are just going to be turned over there.

05:04.012 --> 05:09.618
I'm not going to find it any.

05:10.259 --> 05:13.322
I'm looking for a Flyland Drive by Mike McFintock.

05:13.342 --> 05:15.184
It's in the children's section.

05:15.284 --> 05:17.146
Here's your coffee for the right hand.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.408
We got it.

05:18.428 --> 05:18.748
Okay.

05:18.768 --> 05:19.109
Great.

05:19.609 --> 05:21.351
All right, J940.

05:22.546 --> 05:32.886
I ended up getting four out of the ten books I was looking for.

05:32.986 --> 05:37.855
That's about the results of a survey as flawed as it might have been.

05:39.016 --> 05:43.941
So, what's the problem?

05:44.402 --> 05:49.587
Lack of staffing, growing pains of moving into a new building, and mismanagement, given us some of the reasons.

05:50.028 --> 05:53.772
At one time, there were 30,000 books waiting to be reshelled.

05:54.993 --> 06:00.519
There's too much behind, though.

06:00.539 --> 06:02.982
I would say that's a good one.

06:05.003 --> 06:08.432
You know, the library has had a series of publicized problems.

06:08.492 --> 06:15.030
This book availability is just one of them, but it is one of the reasons that Chief Librarian Ben Dallin is expected to lose his job this week.

06:16.799 --> 06:19.885
Mike Sugarman, Channel 5, I'm News News.

06:19.905 --> 06:25.615
The Chief Librarian could learn his status earlier tomorrow, and that's when the City's Library Commission meets in special sessions.

06:25.795 --> 06:31.766
And remember, an additional... Mike Sugarman is a great radio reporter.

06:31.786 --> 06:37.396
You can see his TV reports here on Channel 5 and hear him every day on KCBS Radio on News 7.

06:37.416 --> 06:37.997
The next piece.

06:41.555 --> 06:43.137
And I'm Pam Moore.

06:43.197 --> 06:45.040
Thank you for staying up with us tonight.

06:45.360 --> 06:52.710
A one-day strike by 7,500 nurses at Kaiser Hospitals in Northern California is just hours away tonight.

06:53.070 --> 06:57.736
The nurses' union says it is frustrated over the lack of progress in negotiations.

06:58.077 --> 07:00.981
So to let us know, let's go tonight with James Satori.

07:01.041 --> 07:05.507
He is standing by live at Kaiser Medical Center in San Francisco.

07:05.587 --> 07:08.731
There's a piece about a Kaiser strike.

07:08.751 --> 07:10.313
That'll tell you when the date is.

07:10.462 --> 07:11.965
I'm not sure.

07:21.586 --> 07:21.967
James Hattori.

07:22.448 --> 07:23.731
James, thank you for that report.

07:23.751 --> 07:27.880
By the way, Kaiser and the nurses' union met last week with federal mediators

07:27.995 --> 07:39.118
a year ago this week, San Francisco's state-of-the-art main public library opened its doors to an eager public.

07:39.238 --> 07:48.096
Now, as Nightbeat's Claudia Collins reports, the library and its critics are at odds, at odds over what to do with miles of unshelled material.

07:48.498 --> 07:55.005
Beneath the floors of San Francisco's multi-million dollar public library is another library you won't see.

07:55.025 --> 08:04.534
Row after row of books and manuscripts, one-of-a-kind periodical collections, even card catalogs that, for now, sit inside the city's storage room at Brooks Hall.

08:05.035 --> 08:18.268
Here is where you'll find the selected works of Mahatma Gandhi, the 18th century collection of Gentleman's Magazine, and countless other books that are in library window, waiting to be moved upstairs, digitized, or thrown away.

08:18.552 --> 08:23.727
Acting Chief Librarian Roberto Estevez is among those determining which stay and which go.

08:24.008 --> 08:33.135
A lot of the books that are there may be given away are those that we are going to be getting rid of because they're duplicates, they're old editions of preface books.

08:35.157 --> 08:41.486
Should the public library be giving away or discarding any of the books in a storage room?

08:41.806 --> 08:47.434
Critics say no, and they worry that volumes of San Francisco history will disappear forever.

08:47.454 --> 08:50.238
These are some of the books that have been discarded from the library.

08:50.538 --> 08:55.425
Historian Walter Miller says he's rescued many books, including rare ones in good condition.

08:55.686 --> 09:02.515
He believes the ones he has and these in Brooks Hall will perish simply because there isn't enough space for them upstairs.

09:02.697 --> 09:19.040
These books, a lot of them will be given away free to the public in sort of a parking lot sale approach to discards, and many of them will be given to other libraries, and many of them will probably go to the dump, like 200-some thousand books that we've done for last year.

09:19.521 --> 09:26.190
The library says it's now going through all this material to make sure they know what's down here and don't give away anything valuable.

09:26.170 --> 09:30.286
But it's unlikely the library will agree to weld the building solution.

09:30.306 --> 09:34.401
Open Brooks Hall to the public as the newest floor of the city's new library.

09:34.843 --> 09:37.834
In San Francisco, Claudia Cowen, New Center 4, on the night before.

09:38.573 --> 09:57.460
Here it is, here it is, here it is.

09:57.862 --> 10:01.326
But it may also be one of the most inefficient and expensive to run.

10:01.386 --> 10:03.107
Just try to check out a book there.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.610
Channel 7's neighbor John is in the newsroom tonight.

10:05.630 --> 10:06.911
There's an exclusive report.

10:06.931 --> 10:08.212
Maybe this is an absurd situation.

10:08.233 --> 10:12.177
Well, Dan, it may only be a year old, but boy doesn't have problems.

10:12.557 --> 10:20.125
Channel 7 News has learned that a newly completed audit shows library operations $700,000 in the red.

10:20.485 --> 10:23.548
The fallacial library is an architectural showpiece.

10:23.798 --> 10:26.261
but the red ink is just part of the trouble.

10:28.864 --> 10:34.731
The more traditional has no place in this library.

10:35.132 --> 10:38.696
The glass and chrome building is flooded with light.

10:38.736 --> 10:45.625
Car catalogs serve as decorative pieces of art, and the cars that once inhabited them as creative wall covering.

10:46.185 --> 10:52.573
And the computers with internet access are attracting people who have never used the library system before.

10:52.857 --> 10:56.183
are more popular than the 49ers and the Giants combined.

10:56.304 --> 11:01.073
Those crowds are one element straining this high-tech showpiece.

11:01.153 --> 11:09.268
The hearings are rarely seen by patrons, but behind the scenes are grappling with mounds of foot, which were beeped often months ago.

11:09.829 --> 11:12.975
And every time I say, we've known them.

11:13.698 --> 11:24.119
And she may not be able to the next time.

11:24.479 --> 11:29.129
With a looming debt, the library may remain severely short-staffed.

11:29.149 --> 11:35.301
The hiring of a new head librarian may be delayed, and purchases of new books may be put on hold.

11:35.652 --> 11:39.435
Although critics say there was never room for them in the first place.

11:39.916 --> 11:49.024
No doubt the building feels spacious enough to accommodate the attendees of thousands of patrons that visit the library each week.

11:49.044 --> 12:00.334
Yet librarians say actual shelf space for books is so tight here that according to one estimate, over a third of the circulating collection remains in storage.

12:01.134 --> 12:05.338
Hundreds of thousands of books have already been given or thrown away.

12:05.588 --> 12:15.978
and critics charged with so little show-speak, that trend will continue.

12:16.398 --> 12:21.603
In general, the books stop the short end of the stick here.

12:21.623 --> 12:31.693
That may be that no matter how troubled, San Francisco's Library of the Future may be giving younger patrons just that, the future.

12:31.813 --> 12:34.195
I think it's a lot better than just books.

12:35.153 --> 12:42.422
But still, the fact remains, library operations are deeply in debt, as we discover to the tune of $700,000.

12:42.762 --> 12:53.536
Mayor Willie Brown has been briefed on the preliminary findings of the new audit, such as to attack the issue aggressively after he returns from his trip to Philadelphia next week.

12:54.577 --> 12:54.657
Dan?

12:55.558 --> 12:57.781
Pretty much.

12:58.602 --> 13:05.110
When people started working, decided to leave the library, a strategy was put into place not to

13:05.090 --> 13:34.388
hired new people to replace them so overtime was put into play and that's when the bills started adding up where the anchor cuts to the co-anchor and the co-anchor is anna chevez who is this very popular uh female co-anchor in the b area just retired and she just has this look on her face she just rolls her eyes she gave ten thousand dollars to the new libraries

13:34.672 --> 13:40.378
Listen, instead of watching this stuff, I just can talk to you now.

13:40.398 --> 13:41.479
Yeah, yeah.

13:41.499 --> 13:42.820
I'll give you this and you can talk to me.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.523
Okay, and you know, trust me with it.

13:45.583 --> 13:49.406
Okay, well, let me just give you a quick five-minute run through.

13:49.427 --> 13:49.947
Well, let's see.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.650
We've got an hour here, so let's take, you know.

13:53.030 --> 13:56.493
First of all, let me give you some material I have so I won't forget.

13:56.513 --> 14:00.738
This is a list of some of the pertinent phone numbers.

14:00.758 --> 14:01.118
Oh, good.

14:01.486 --> 14:02.848
I thought this was a classic.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.750
I didn't notice this until I called you.

14:04.971 --> 14:09.476
This is a phone book, a packed old phone book with the library on the cover.

14:09.657 --> 14:11.119
I never noticed that.

14:11.139 --> 14:12.300
I've been looking at that for a year.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.422
I could take these things, right?

14:13.622 --> 14:14.944
Yeah, this is all going to go with you.

14:15.705 --> 14:21.532
And I thought that this was really important to me throughout this whole thing.

14:21.552 --> 14:28.962
This is the last scene out of The Skin of Our Teeth where Thornton Wilder says,

14:29.566 --> 14:30.607
Yes, remember.

14:30.968 --> 14:33.090
Remember, Maggie, we almost lost them once before.

14:33.130 --> 14:34.171
He's talking about the books.

14:34.191 --> 14:35.693
This is act three after the war.

14:36.374 --> 14:42.101
And when we finally did collect a few touring copies out of old cellars, they ran in everyone's head like a fever.

14:42.161 --> 14:43.683
They as good as rebuilt the world.

14:44.303 --> 14:47.167
Oh, I've never forgotten for long at a time that living a struggle.

14:47.647 --> 14:55.877
I know that every good and excellent thing in the world stands moment by moment on the razor edge of danger and must be fought for, whether it's a field or a home or a country.

14:56.785 --> 14:58.047
Oh, I'm jumping ahead.

14:58.367 --> 14:59.749
There's goosebumps here.

14:59.829 --> 15:00.070
Yeah.

15:00.090 --> 15:01.451
The kind of stuff I look for, by the way.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.513
I thought you liked that.

15:02.793 --> 15:04.776
That's Thornton Wilder, Skate of Artie.

15:05.577 --> 15:07.560
Second most produced play.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.663
Why was he talking about books, Wilder?

15:09.683 --> 15:10.985
It's an amazing play.

15:11.025 --> 15:14.510
The first act is... This is so good, man.

15:14.530 --> 15:17.894
This was 1943 when the United States was losing the war.

15:18.655 --> 15:24.143
And this was... Act one is after the flood...

15:25.203 --> 15:31.997
Act I is after the Ice Age, Act II is after the flood, and Act III is after the war.

15:32.838 --> 15:34.862
It's just this cycling thing.

15:34.882 --> 15:35.443
It was 1943.

15:35.584 --> 15:37.628
We were losing the war.

15:38.189 --> 15:40.714
I have a book of all Archibald MacLeish's books.

15:41.386 --> 16:05.166
public speeches on the books saving the books during the war and what the library can do for the war yeah yeah and then and of course the war led to the uh national archives project which is i mean we were talking about digitalization right but that you know i don't i don't know that any project will ever surpass uh well somewhere between the wpa and the national archives when they put the censor

16:05.517 --> 16:08.942
on microfilm.

16:08.962 --> 16:11.726
I mean, the microfilming they did was astonishing.

16:11.746 --> 16:13.108
What's the name of the project again?

16:13.329 --> 16:15.712
Well, that would have been the National Archives.

16:15.732 --> 16:17.836
There was a name for the project.

16:17.856 --> 16:19.438
This would have been right after the war.

16:19.658 --> 16:20.900
It started before the war.

16:21.061 --> 16:21.962
Who learned to check it?

16:22.322 --> 16:24.846
Well, when it started out, it was a Roosevelt project.

16:24.926 --> 16:27.150
It started out under the WPA.

16:27.390 --> 16:29.193
And what were they microfilming?

16:29.513 --> 16:32.638
They microfilmed all the United States Census.

16:33.428 --> 16:37.534
all these handwritten door-to-door sentences going back.

16:37.554 --> 16:39.578
That's what computers would be good for.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.379
1870s.

16:40.419 --> 16:42.602
That would be good stuff to scan, don't you think?

16:42.662 --> 16:43.844
Yeah, terrific stuff.

16:43.964 --> 16:48.992
And particularly with the microfilm, it's easy because it's already been put in a machine-readable form.

16:49.113 --> 16:51.937
But it's all handwritten, you know.

16:52.017 --> 16:53.960
I'm going down to the L.C.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.883
again in a couple weeks.

16:55.903 --> 16:59.689
The National Archives out here, the big one, you know, the

17:00.412 --> 17:00.732
The U.S.

17:00.772 --> 17:02.574
Census Bureau is out in San Bruno.

17:02.594 --> 17:04.636
It's the main one for that.

17:04.657 --> 17:05.317
Everything's there.

17:05.457 --> 17:05.918
Yeah.

17:05.938 --> 17:07.139
That's a very interesting issue.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.782
Well, I do a lot of census work.

17:10.022 --> 17:13.686
I mean, should all that archival stuff be kept, I wonder?

17:13.886 --> 17:20.814
Well, the census is, I mean, as an architectural or any kind of genealogy and historical tool, it's just vital.

17:20.854 --> 17:22.175
The answer is yes, probably.

17:22.255 --> 17:25.879
It has everybody, who they are, where they lived, and what they did for a living.

17:25.859 --> 17:30.885
There are people who are going to tell you, though, that it's the information that matters there, not the piece of paper.

17:31.085 --> 17:32.667
And I wonder... Well, the paper's gone.

17:33.188 --> 17:34.269
The paper is gone.

17:34.309 --> 17:35.130
The paper is gone.

17:35.551 --> 17:42.659
At that point in time, they put a lot of newspapers on microfilm and put all these sensors, and they tended to throw out... Well, great.

17:42.679 --> 17:43.861
This is interesting to me.

17:44.562 --> 17:47.065
You know, I know... How do you know of it?

17:47.165 --> 17:48.446
How do you know of it?

17:48.466 --> 17:52.692
I know of it because I swim in it all the time, you know, when I do history work.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.495
But there are books.

17:55.711 --> 18:11.935
I know the National Archives has put together some books of how they did what they did, but I've seen pictures of rooms the size of a football field with technicians working on microfilm machines.

18:12.335 --> 18:14.579
It's massive.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.942
It started with the WPA.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.506
They started documenting the material.

18:19.606 --> 18:24.233
Oh, I have to show you that.

18:24.280 --> 18:29.486
I'm going to see Nick in a couple hours.

18:29.666 --> 18:33.791
They get an inventory of the archives of San Francisco.

18:35.393 --> 18:38.497
Remember now, this is an archive.

18:38.537 --> 18:48.128
They went through every library and city hall and every municipal building and they indexed everything, every archival record that they had.

18:48.732 --> 18:55.021
About three years, they had about 250 people working on it, and then they paid each agency to cooperate.

18:55.081 --> 18:56.002
This is from the library?

18:56.363 --> 18:57.765
That's something I picked up.

18:57.945 --> 19:00.288
I'm a book collector.

19:00.369 --> 19:06.798
This project here alone is just, it'll never happen again.

19:07.118 --> 19:08.400
And they did thousands.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.683
They did every city in the United States.

19:10.824 --> 19:12.145
It's astonishing.

19:12.165 --> 19:13.628
What do you do pre-computer?

19:13.908 --> 19:15.270
What do you do for a living, Walter?

19:15.630 --> 19:17.473
I'm a student right now.

19:17.673 --> 19:20.096
I'm a pre-law student at City College.

19:21.117 --> 19:22.478
Here in San Francisco.

19:22.518 --> 19:23.419
Here in San Francisco.

19:23.519 --> 19:26.282
And I came out here in 1987 from Washington, D.C.

19:26.303 --> 19:29.466
I grew up in Washington and Arlington.

19:29.486 --> 19:36.674
And I got out of high school in 1980, I believe it was, I started working for the Smithsonian.

19:37.094 --> 19:40.939
And I was an audiovisual technician.

19:41.019 --> 19:47.646
And then I also spent a year at the National Air and Space Museum as an exhibit technician.

19:48.284 --> 19:52.889
And so I did a lot, but it was all history and, you know, that kind of thing.

19:52.909 --> 19:55.232
Plus I grew up, I grew up with history.

19:55.292 --> 20:02.741
I told you on the phone, you know, my grandfather started a tree business in Arlington County in 1919.

20:03.662 --> 20:11.511
And between him and his father, they restored Mount Vernon's trees and they restored the White House trees for Jack Yonathus.

20:11.712 --> 20:16.317
And so it's history and trees and preservation and books that come up in forever.

20:17.073 --> 20:19.235
So I'm not doing anything I don't normally do.

20:19.335 --> 20:22.498
And as far as making a living goes, I'm a carpenter when I need to make money.

20:22.518 --> 20:24.420
So I can do that if I have to.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.382
I try to work as little as possible, of course.

20:27.402 --> 20:29.244
And you indicated that you're married.

20:29.644 --> 20:30.165
I'm married.

20:30.225 --> 20:31.086
Oh, yes, she works.

20:31.146 --> 20:31.746
Your wife works.

20:31.786 --> 20:32.467
My wife works.

20:32.947 --> 20:37.692
And right now, I'm in hot to my ears to the U.S.

20:37.712 --> 20:38.412
government.

20:39.553 --> 20:41.575
But it'll all work out.

20:42.156 --> 20:44.818
My wife, when I was doing general madness,

20:45.102 --> 20:48.729
God bless the wives who support your dreams.

20:48.749 --> 20:49.591
She really does.

20:49.651 --> 20:52.657
She supports me and talks completely.

20:52.958 --> 20:56.906
She's a coal miner's daughter from Pennsylvania.

20:56.946 --> 20:59.010
You have to have that moral.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.409
support, not just the passive support.

21:01.429 --> 21:03.072
Yeah, no, you're exactly right.

21:03.252 --> 21:06.117
They have to totally believe what you're doing.

21:06.137 --> 21:11.025
I'm sure, particularly, I mean, I'm not the one to talk here, I think.

21:11.086 --> 21:12.067
We are still in debt.

21:12.127 --> 21:16.996
I mean, my book's been well, but I haven't come close to it.

21:17.016 --> 21:18.699
I'll probably die all in one year.

21:18.719 --> 21:19.400
Flushing out.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.121
Yeah, yeah.

21:20.101 --> 21:22.543
Is it worth it?

21:22.603 --> 21:23.064
You bet.

21:23.144 --> 21:23.785
Yeah, it's worth it.

21:23.805 --> 21:24.946
What else are you going to do?

21:25.186 --> 21:25.927
That's right, exactly.

21:26.047 --> 21:27.048
It's nearly as exciting.

21:27.248 --> 21:28.749
I'm doing it again now.

21:29.070 --> 21:33.654
This is hot, what you're working on now.

21:33.694 --> 21:36.477
I have an exquisite sense of getting into that story.

21:36.517 --> 21:37.638
This is leading-edge stuff.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.140
You're ten years ahead of your time.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.041
Well, I think so.

21:41.061 --> 21:47.948
This is going to be the book for... Just as Gentle Madness has been declared the book on book collecting for our generation.

21:48.232 --> 21:48.873
It has been.

21:48.893 --> 21:49.815
I can't wait to read it.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.939
You know how a book club does.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.824
I never get trying to read books.

21:54.844 --> 21:55.365
Well, I'll try to do it.

21:55.405 --> 21:57.710
I promise I'll send you one when I send the tape back.

21:57.870 --> 21:58.772
Oh, I need some new ones.

21:59.072 --> 22:01.136
Do you have a paperback?

22:01.216 --> 22:03.781
No, the beauty of my book is it's not in paperback.

22:03.841 --> 22:07.387
They only did it in... Well, it's going to come out in two years when the new book comes out.

22:07.628 --> 22:09.211
But it still sells in hardcover.

22:09.712 --> 22:09.852
Uh-huh.

22:10.034 --> 22:12.577
You know, I'm smiling.

22:12.737 --> 22:16.220
No, I was impressed when you told me you saw many cops.

22:17.141 --> 22:21.005
I don't just feel good for you, I feel good for my cause.

22:22.367 --> 22:29.855
Newsreaders and I have a much bigger constituency now than I ever did then, because I write a monthly column for this magazine called Good Wheel, which is worldwide.

22:30.255 --> 22:32.157
Oh, I know that.

22:32.177 --> 22:34.259
Well, I'm a regular, I'm in there every month.

22:34.279 --> 22:34.460
Oh, okay.

22:35.461 --> 22:37.763
And it may even be that I'll do a

22:37.844 --> 22:39.887
Well, I don't want to do that.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.349
You can do that, yeah.

22:41.369 --> 22:43.211
But let's talk, let's do their timing.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.454
We may have to get together again.

22:45.635 --> 22:46.416
That's okay.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.479
At least we'll give you a crash course.

22:49.019 --> 22:54.987
So when the new library opened, we met up at a... Now, how did you get into this?

22:55.047 --> 23:04.240
Well, the first, I would say that there's no doubt that the flashpoint for the revolt... Would you bring that to the recorder?

23:05.840 --> 23:23.837
I was aware that there were serious problems at the library before the old library closed.

23:24.177 --> 23:26.839
You know, I can't talk enough.

23:27.100 --> 23:27.620
I couldn't talk.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.002
I take all your time talking about the old library.

23:30.563 --> 23:32.425
It was definitely overcrowded.

23:33.005 --> 23:35.087
It definitely needed to be

23:35.540 --> 23:42.971
to be retrofitted, but in 1989, before the earthquake, you could walk into the stacks.

23:43.011 --> 23:50.002
They have seven stories of stacks made of Carnegie steel, and you could go in there and you could just get lost.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.486
It was like... A nice, solid Carnegie library.

23:52.506 --> 23:53.307
It was incredible.

23:54.028 --> 23:57.413
It had two sets of stacks.

23:59.080 --> 24:05.147
two sets of stacks that I believe would have worked out to about 25 linear miles of shelf space.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.808
And how did you determine them?

24:06.828 --> 24:12.474
We actually measured the shelves, Nick Baker and myself and two anonymous librarians.

24:12.494 --> 24:15.177
It was alleged that your figures were wrong.

24:15.197 --> 24:15.638
They were.

24:17.039 --> 24:23.586
Actually, what happened is I didn't actually have anything to do with the numbers.

24:23.666 --> 24:28.952
I actually showed up to take pictures of the card catalog, and then it turned out into a shelf counting episode.

24:29.506 --> 24:30.988
So, and then I couldn't leave.

24:31.048 --> 24:31.810
That was the thing.

24:31.830 --> 24:35.656
We were locked in, just abandoned the library, you know, and couldn't leave.

24:36.337 --> 24:49.978
So I, you know, jumped in, helped measure, but then the numbers, the numbers, one of the librarians made a serious mistake on the spreadsheet, and the numbers came out high, and then we reported them right away.

24:50.414 --> 24:53.317
So what are the final limits?

24:53.337 --> 25:02.806
Well, that happened on Thursday, and we came out in the paper, so there were 49 miles, which is a good number for San Francisco, being 49ers.

25:03.767 --> 25:17.080
And then the Saturday paper reported that the library disputed our figures and said there were 30.6 miles in the old library, which was nine miles more than they had claimed three days earlier.

25:17.313 --> 25:26.789
And then on the, I think it was the Tuesday paper, Kathy Page, the acting librarian, came out and admitted that the new main library was too small to hold its collection.

25:26.809 --> 25:28.492
And that was the point of the whole exercise.

25:28.813 --> 25:32.960
Okay, and then what is the... We called that the grand mea culpa, you know.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.984
The grand mea culpa.

25:35.004 --> 25:35.104
Okay.

25:35.124 --> 25:38.730
I cop.

25:40.364 --> 25:46.070
You know, they finally copped the fact that the new main was too small to hold the collection.

25:46.210 --> 25:52.536
Well, how many... Up to that point, they were saying that there were miles of empty shelves in the new main.

25:52.576 --> 25:54.598
So, how many miles of shelves do they have in the new main?

25:54.878 --> 25:55.879
No one's ever measured.

25:57.421 --> 26:02.866
I would like very much to... So, we should ask Gina if it's a long way.

26:03.186 --> 26:06.810
The numbers that they claim and the numbers that are really in there aren't the same.

26:07.043 --> 26:21.881
I know that, and unless they go and they do a legitimate count of the shelf, the footage, the linear footage of the shelves, it's all just numbers from... I'm quoting Stephen Coulter, and he says Walter Villa and people of his book.

26:22.722 --> 26:23.483
Yeah, yeah.

26:23.543 --> 26:32.494
You have been fingered as a troublemaker, as a left-winger, as a gaslight, as a perpetual...

26:32.693 --> 26:35.818
Pretty much I've heard all this before.

26:35.878 --> 26:46.273
And he's saying it on the record to a writer who's with a national, I mean, he's going, you know, I said, he's calling the women, you know, the eight white women.

26:46.293 --> 26:49.057
And I said, you know, I've heard that expression.

26:49.077 --> 26:51.701
He called them the ten pot-stirring white women.

26:51.721 --> 26:55.146
Yeah, and I said, I mean, do you want to modify that?

26:55.166 --> 26:55.967
He said, no, I don't.

26:56.007 --> 26:56.808
I stand by it.

26:57.129 --> 26:58.311
Yeah, he's a can-do guy.

26:58.411 --> 27:00.894
I said, so you're saying that these women are racists.

27:00.914 --> 27:02.076
And he said, absolutely.

27:02.562 --> 27:04.565
and they're against gays.

27:04.726 --> 27:06.148
I said, how so?

27:06.168 --> 27:07.190
You know, they don't reach out.

27:08.051 --> 27:10.455
Well, I kind of want to paraphrase it.

27:10.475 --> 27:11.296
Yeah, yeah.

27:11.316 --> 27:13.981
Well, that to me, what's a librarian supposed to do?

27:14.001 --> 27:22.595
I mean, a librarian is supposed to explain, understand, maintain a collection and develop it and make it available and help you get the things you want.

27:23.256 --> 27:24.117
Public service.

27:24.137 --> 27:27.102
You know, your job is not community relations to go out and say,

27:27.301 --> 27:53.562
well the affinity the affinity center steven culture created the affinity centers to get the money that they because they didn't have enough money and they wanted to and they and then also the affinity centers and those people are going to be real upset when eventually this the truth comes out if it ever does um were basically a smoke screen for the corporations that were going in the corporations got

27:53.710 --> 28:06.089
got major, you know, what do they call it, naming opportunity out of the New Main, but really didn't make the kinds of contributions that the individuals that gave to the Affinity Centers did.

28:06.770 --> 28:13.440
You go in the Affinity Centers and you'll find these beautiful little rooms that have a handful of books in them and no staffers, no librarians.

28:13.460 --> 28:17.486
So really what you've done is you've made more of the collection inaccessible.

28:18.007 --> 28:18.848
Well, that's right.

28:18.868 --> 28:22.333
Well, I said to him, again, I'm coming in from the East Coast,

28:22.870 --> 28:38.871
And I said, you know, the idea of an affinity group, whatever you want to call it, if you're going to do a gay lesbian thing, hey, that's cool, but how much money did you put aside for collection development?

28:39.155 --> 28:41.078
Did you target any collections that you wanted?

28:41.098 --> 28:43.702
Did you hire a full-time researcher and a curator?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.223
Right.

28:44.303 --> 28:45.545
None of that happened.

28:45.785 --> 28:50.673
And, you know, so you've got a gay, lesbian room, great, but what if they're very pretty, but can they fight?

28:50.693 --> 28:52.275
Remember that line in the dirty desert?

28:52.415 --> 28:53.417
Exactly, exactly.

28:53.757 --> 28:55.099
What have you got here?

28:55.320 --> 28:59.526
What have you got here to attract an international scholar to come along and do some work?

28:59.793 --> 29:02.036
Like my lawyer, he says, whatever.

29:06.001 --> 29:21.902
The thing about the affinity setters that I found kind of laughable is that there's no women's affinity setter, which I found it interesting that nobody felt that the women weren't worth approaching.

29:22.321 --> 29:30.849
And there's no Jewish affinities that are, which I thought was pretty funny because my friend Arthur Carlson turns to me and he says, what, we don't have the money?

29:33.712 --> 29:37.216
You know, I just fell out.

29:37.236 --> 29:41.921
You know, I mean, you know, in New York, it would be an outrage.

29:42.982 --> 29:51.450
San Francisco's never had a real, a real big Jewish constituency, you know, but in New York, I mean, it was Italian.

29:51.802 --> 29:52.985
It used to be.

29:53.025 --> 29:57.013
No, no Italian.

29:57.594 --> 30:00.621
No Caucasian males.

30:02.725 --> 30:04.349
If you're a white woman, you're out.

30:05.411 --> 30:10.722
So I guess if you're a white woman at Podstor, you really don't have much there.

30:10.702 --> 30:35.595
yeah but but actually most of those white women pot stirrers and i fully qualify as one and i you know i take i i wear that badge with pride which badge you wear a white woman pot stirr white woman yeah well he said we're all of the all of the of the the dissident for white women pot stirrers so uh i i you know i'm proud to say i am one of those okay so uh walter how did this group get together

30:36.048 --> 30:37.209
That's okay.

30:37.590 --> 30:39.712
You mentioned the word sell.

30:39.732 --> 30:42.054
It's almost like your political action movement.

30:42.074 --> 30:42.295
Oh, yeah.

30:42.315 --> 30:44.957
I'll give you a quick flowchart on that.

30:45.838 --> 30:55.749
It started out, first of all, I knew there were problems at the old library, and that's a whole story in itself, but I'll cut to the new Maine opening.

30:55.809 --> 31:02.376
The new Maine opened, first of all, the old Maine was closed for five months, which was frustrating.

31:02.609 --> 31:06.495
and made me worry a lot about what was going on with the move.

31:07.156 --> 31:14.728
But then the new main opened on April 18, 1996, the anniversary of the 1906 earthquake, which is pretty ironic.

31:16.110 --> 31:17.993
From the ashes.

31:18.013 --> 31:18.914
Yeah, right, right.

31:19.615 --> 31:26.686
Actually, exactly where the old city hall was, you know, that collapsed in the 1906 earthquake.

31:26.706 --> 31:30.372
It had taken 25 years to build it, and when it collapsed, they found

31:30.520 --> 31:38.287
that there was no structural, I mean, it was a big old, you know, scam that had been going on for a decade, a couple decades.

31:38.307 --> 31:41.530
So, I mean, that lot has a history.

31:42.811 --> 31:46.995
There's a buried river under there called the Hayes River.

31:47.075 --> 31:47.496
H-A-Y-E-S.

31:48.076 --> 31:53.081
H-E-Y-E-S, yeah, and which is actually seeping into the walls of Brooks Hall now, which is a problem.

31:53.101 --> 31:54.923
They didn't know that when they went to build it?

31:54.943 --> 31:55.723
Oh, they knew it was there.

31:56.064 --> 31:57.865
I've heard people say they didn't know it was there.

31:57.925 --> 31:59.667
They actually pumped the river.

31:59.866 --> 32:02.269
around the site when they dug the hole.

32:02.730 --> 32:05.733
Yeah, I just thought it was certainly a bad thing.

32:05.753 --> 32:09.037
I mean, the French built their huge blinds.

32:09.258 --> 32:15.846
Yeah, I called it the biblio-fuck-frances, but I haven't seen it for myself.

32:15.946 --> 32:21.353
But I have read a great spoof.

32:21.593 --> 32:22.694
It's in here somewhere.

32:22.735 --> 32:24.477
Someone wrote a spoof of that.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.199
It's hilarious.

32:26.539 --> 32:28.742
It's in this pile here somewhere.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.950
Someone did an elaborate speech.

32:30.970 --> 32:32.353
What am I going to take here, by the way?

32:32.874 --> 32:34.156
Well, I'll let you decide.

32:35.017 --> 32:37.762
Let me tell you what happened with the opening.

32:38.543 --> 32:41.027
There was the opening on June 6th.

32:41.047 --> 32:42.069
No, May 30th.

32:42.369 --> 32:42.569
Excuse me.

32:42.589 --> 32:51.564
May 30th, Nicholson Baker and Gray Brecon spoke at the Coret Auditorium in the New Library at a speech called The Destruction of Knowledge.

32:51.584 --> 32:53.187
This is the defining moment.

32:53.207 --> 32:55.270
It was the flashpoint for the revolt.

32:55.807 --> 33:17.308
At that point, there were about 200 people there, maybe, and a lot of the real hardcore historian types that I knew were there, the younger historians particularly, and Gray spoke in essence about the whole concept of

33:17.575 --> 33:21.960
When you get one God, you've got to get rid of the old God so that you can't have two.

33:22.641 --> 33:25.525
You can't serve two masters.

33:25.645 --> 33:26.686
Exactly.

33:26.967 --> 33:27.587
Exactly.

33:27.808 --> 33:32.653
And he spoke, of course, about the Library of Alexandria and these sorts of things.

33:32.673 --> 33:34.476
And he took it all up to the present.

33:34.496 --> 33:41.885
And then Nick Baker did his kind of a stand-up version of his New Yorker piece.

33:42.445 --> 33:43.287
A little more bite.

33:43.827 --> 33:44.528
Much more bite.

33:44.727 --> 33:46.991
I read the text of both.

33:47.011 --> 33:47.532
I have both.

33:47.552 --> 33:48.013
That's great.

33:48.033 --> 33:49.316
You have the original speech.

33:49.376 --> 33:50.458
And he read that word for word.

33:50.959 --> 34:02.560
He said exactly... And people were just... I mean, the script can't capture the kind of tension and anger and concern that was in the room.

34:02.721 --> 34:03.783
You could cut it with a knife.

34:03.803 --> 34:08.271
So you think it's almost like Mark Anthony's funeral nation?

34:08.622 --> 34:15.572
I wasn't there, but I imagine it was kind of like, let's do it for the Gipper, at least.

34:15.632 --> 34:19.217
I've seen that one.

34:19.478 --> 34:27.669
And I went over to a friend's house that night, a historian friend, and got drunk, which is something I don't do all that often.

34:27.729 --> 34:30.073
Sat down with a bottle of whiskey and drank it.

34:30.153 --> 34:31.575
I mean, the world was coming to an end.

34:32.230 --> 34:34.153
Why is the world coming through?

34:34.173 --> 34:40.343
Well, because, I mean, we realized, first of all, the old library was something that we all just loved more than anything.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.426
So you're passionate about books and libraries?

34:42.446 --> 34:43.708
More than passionate.

34:43.809 --> 34:45.672
You know, just live for them.

34:45.972 --> 34:53.384
And the thing is, is that it wasn't just that they had trashed a lot of books.

34:53.845 --> 34:56.449
It was the way they had done it and the reasons they had done it.

34:56.969 --> 35:08.105
I think that that was really the thing, is that when you realize that this could go on everywhere, I mean, if we didn't stop this here in San Francisco, this was going to burn throughout the whole United States.

35:08.125 --> 35:11.029
Just talk, remove that, would you move that bottle just so it's not there?

35:12.411 --> 35:16.116
And, uh, I want to get this with that San Francisco Bay Area.

35:16.136 --> 35:17.157
Yeah, there you go.

35:17.438 --> 35:21.604
Didn't even set that prop up.

35:22.505 --> 35:23.606
Just keep talking.

35:23.626 --> 35:24.067
Uh-huh.

35:24.087 --> 35:26.250
So, um, so we, uh,

35:27.715 --> 35:31.801
So then that night, some people had connected.

35:31.841 --> 35:40.092
And I mean, the stage after the show, everybody came up on the stage, and there were about 150, 100 people on the stage talking and saying, what are we going to do about this?

35:40.973 --> 35:51.608
And the union guild, the people who had organized that evening, at the next commission meeting where, well, actually, Baker said, everybody come to the next commission meeting.

35:51.628 --> 35:52.789
It's Tuesday night.

35:52.809 --> 35:54.071
It must have been about a week later.

35:54.932 --> 35:56.895
And I went to that library commission meeting.

35:57.466 --> 36:03.433
And I spoke in defense at the card catalog, which was the initial issue.

36:04.234 --> 36:06.636
They wanted to destroy the card catalog.

36:06.656 --> 36:08.779
This was, you know, in Dallin's days.

36:09.820 --> 36:16.747
And I got very involved in that, and then that led to another thing, led to another thing, led to another thing.

36:16.787 --> 36:21.753
Eventually, we had a list of about, you know, about 100 issues, primary issues.

36:21.853 --> 36:23.054
It was very complex.

36:23.074 --> 36:26.258
You had to sort of prioritize.

36:26.744 --> 36:32.192
there was a meeting that was put together out in Berkeley at Melissa Riley's house.

36:32.212 --> 36:40.305
And I imagine by the time your book comes out, this won't need to be a secret, but it's kind of, it was kind of an issue because she does work for SFPL.

36:40.325 --> 36:43.910
And, um, and that's where I would say it began.

36:44.010 --> 36:52.083
And, and that night after the meeting, we went out, uh, everybody left and I was sitting out on the front stoop with Melissa having a beer.

36:53.084 --> 36:53.545
And, uh,

36:54.014 --> 36:58.961
with Melissa and with Andrea Grimes, and everybody else had gone, all 30 or 40 people that showed up.

36:59.822 --> 37:04.949
And we decided that we needed a name for this group.

37:05.029 --> 37:13.981
We needed to have a name, and we looked up the street sign, and since it was a corner of Edith and Cedar in Berkeley, we decided Edith Cedar Group was a good name.

37:14.662 --> 37:17.827
And it sounded like a librarian, and we knew we had to be anonymous.

37:17.907 --> 37:21.512
I mean, you know, there was just too many of us that were librarians.

37:21.532 --> 37:23.194
I won't, I'll just, because I'm not going to.

37:23.393 --> 37:29.342
I think that's kind of out of the bag now, actually.

37:29.703 --> 37:31.045
I've heard it twice.

37:31.385 --> 37:35.412
Yeah, and it got into a newspaper article by mistake one time.

37:35.592 --> 37:39.057
Oh, you did talk to Dicha.

37:39.238 --> 37:39.618
Great.

37:39.638 --> 37:40.460
Did you see her books?

37:41.461 --> 37:41.681
No.

37:41.862 --> 37:45.307
She's got problems getting in her garage or something like that.

37:45.688 --> 37:46.950
She was a little nervous.

37:46.970 --> 37:47.190
Yeah, yeah.

37:47.407 --> 37:51.273
I think you probably have rarer books than she does.

37:51.553 --> 37:54.818
She didn't understand the concept of the last copy.

37:54.858 --> 37:57.902
She was talking about the last copy in the San Francisco system.

37:57.922 --> 38:01.267
It's actually the last copy concept for America.

38:01.547 --> 38:01.848
Right.

38:02.028 --> 38:03.711
Which is what I thought she was talking about.

38:04.131 --> 38:04.432
Right.

38:04.632 --> 38:07.296
Yeah, no, she would mean for the SFPL.

38:07.316 --> 38:09.439
So that was kind of a disappointment for me.

38:09.459 --> 38:11.001
I was kind of hoping it would be 8%.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.545
But that's, you know, that's a small event.

38:13.605 --> 38:14.186
Yeah.

38:14.467 --> 38:21.462
Well, anyway, this, that meeting, actually, at that meeting, a whole bunch of, the whole, there was a whole, what are we going to do about this?

38:22.063 --> 38:31.183
You know, and there were so many issues, and I don't want to use the word agenda, that everybody had an issue they were particularly interested in.

38:31.450 --> 38:51.592
or particularly angry about them, and everybody kind of went like that, you know, into these different issues, and there was another Edith Cedar meeting, and then I remember that I started falling out with the original Edith Cedar group pretty early on, realizing that I was much more of a hardliner than some of these people were.

38:51.612 --> 38:56.698
They wanted to negotiate with the library, with Dallin, and

38:57.083 --> 39:09.863
and people down there, administrators, and I knew that that was not going to happen, and as a matter of fact, I remember my rallying cry was, hey guys, wake up and smell the corporate napalm, you know.

39:09.883 --> 39:14.731
You're a little, you are definitely, you're political here.

39:14.751 --> 39:22.483
Yeah, and so my little group that came out of it, and it took a few months for this to develop, we called ourselves the Library of

39:22.835 --> 39:28.101
The Library War Council, for lack of a better name.

39:29.863 --> 39:31.404
Consisting of who besides yourself?

39:31.424 --> 39:37.391
That would have primarily been the Three Musketeers, me, Kerwin, and Gillespie.

39:38.672 --> 39:51.846
And then, of course, we were getting a lot of mainline information from some of the librarians, like Andrea and so forth.

39:52.096 --> 39:53.218
But that was the main group.

39:53.238 --> 39:54.741
And then there were others in that group, too.

39:54.801 --> 39:56.806
Aditya came in a little bit on that.

39:56.826 --> 40:06.966
But primarily, I would say it was the Three Musketeers, because we were the ones that were motivating and then following up on the media.

40:07.452 --> 40:09.074
And Gillespie, who I haven't talked to.

40:09.095 --> 40:10.256
You really should talk to him.

40:10.557 --> 40:12.960
I asked him, I said, do you want to talk to Nick?

40:12.980 --> 40:21.013
And he said, I will talk to Nick if Nick wants to talk about how we did the media, how we did what we did, how we made this thing a national story.

40:21.053 --> 40:22.655
I said, that's what I can talk to him about.

40:22.675 --> 40:26.581
He said, otherwise, he says, you know, I'm just a flack.

40:26.601 --> 40:29.365
What does he do?

40:29.385 --> 40:30.928
He works for a corporation.

40:31.088 --> 40:32.430
He's like an office director.

40:33.136 --> 40:42.486
He's like a publicist, administrator type person, and then he runs a thing, primarily, his main thing is a public access project.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.950
He takes on causes that were... How many people would get to see him?

40:45.970 --> 40:47.172
Maybe I could do a telephone number.

40:47.192 --> 40:48.293
He's a telephone guy.

40:48.633 --> 40:50.135
So, what's the phone number?

40:50.155 --> 40:51.857
It's on the list I gave you.

40:51.877 --> 40:52.898
He's a telephone guy.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.562
He's an interesting character.

40:56.778 --> 41:03.565
I'll give you a sense of how much respect and how good he is, Kerwin and I call him Media God.

41:04.566 --> 41:06.327
Media God, yeah.

41:06.347 --> 41:12.413
Everybody in this thing, it sort of developed this medieval, you know, everything had a name.

41:12.533 --> 41:15.897
You know, you had to keep it fun, you know.

41:16.597 --> 41:22.583
Was there a possibility that, you know, like they say in the stories they must have mentioned it,

41:23.778 --> 41:25.123
kicking your eye off the ball.

41:25.384 --> 41:31.003
It didn't become one of these things that develops an energy of its own.

41:31.675 --> 41:34.598
No, it's a bureaucracy that becomes self-sustaining.

41:34.778 --> 41:35.479
No, not at all.

41:35.499 --> 41:47.253
As a matter of fact, that was one of the reasons that Edith Cedar Group and the little cell I was involved with broke apart because Edith Cedar was like really getting into some bureaucracy.

41:47.693 --> 41:52.298
And our thing, we had a list of people that we wanted out of our public library.

41:52.639 --> 41:53.139
That was it.

41:53.299 --> 41:59.286
I mean, we had to start by removing some of these people because they were a complete obstacle to change.

41:59.553 --> 42:01.075
They were lying to the media.

42:01.415 --> 42:03.698
They were taking money.

42:03.798 --> 42:05.260
They were hiring people.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.962
It was just a runaway train.

42:07.363 --> 42:11.729
So we knew our first thing we had to do was get rid of some of the players, and that's what we did.

42:11.749 --> 42:12.650
So you made a hit list.

42:12.670 --> 42:14.112
We made a hit list.

42:14.312 --> 42:15.714
Dallin being number one.

42:15.734 --> 42:16.895
Dallin was number one.

42:17.296 --> 42:17.977
Got him.

42:18.377 --> 42:18.858
Got him.

42:19.579 --> 42:20.900
Kathy Page was number two.

42:21.221 --> 42:21.761
Finally got her.

42:21.841 --> 42:22.843
Pretty much got her.

42:23.363 --> 42:25.226
David Price was number three.

42:25.386 --> 42:27.128
David Price was who?

42:27.148 --> 42:28.530
He was Ken Dallin's accountant.

42:29.253 --> 42:31.296
The books guy, the money.

42:32.117 --> 42:32.918
We got rid of him.

42:33.779 --> 42:37.164
Is this pretty much the prioritization?

42:37.184 --> 42:38.466
Yeah, we went right down the list.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.189
It was a punch list.

42:40.229 --> 42:41.651
Price was third on the punch list?

42:41.671 --> 42:42.472
Price was third.

42:43.073 --> 42:50.083
No, Coulter was lower down the list because Coulter was on the outside, and we needed to get the people on the inside first.

42:50.103 --> 42:51.425
Coulter's probably number one now.

42:51.705 --> 42:53.708
Coulter is it.

42:54.160 --> 42:54.861
It's his turn.

42:54.901 --> 42:56.804
Since I've arrived, there's a watcher poster.

42:56.884 --> 42:57.985
Yeah, I got one there for you.

43:00.248 --> 43:01.630
That's good.

43:01.810 --> 43:02.691
I'm glad to know that.

43:02.932 --> 43:04.794
And I was going to ask him about it.

43:04.854 --> 43:05.595
Not necessary.

43:05.675 --> 43:06.817
He said, look at this.

43:07.598 --> 43:07.858
Yeah.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.060
And I went, ooh.

43:09.501 --> 43:13.666
And I started reading some of these things into the tape report.

43:13.686 --> 43:16.049
You know, the report is taken.

43:16.250 --> 43:17.371
Uh-huh.

43:17.391 --> 43:19.875
That's pretty cool.

43:19.955 --> 43:22.678
Now I asked him to respond to something he showed me.

43:23.059 --> 43:23.239
Uh-huh.

43:23.641 --> 43:27.205
Yeah, it's sort of like he opened the door, as they say.

43:29.988 --> 43:30.709
Totally.

43:30.729 --> 43:33.492
Yeah, but the guy's also coated in Teflon, I have to tell you.

43:33.512 --> 43:34.273
No, he's slick.

43:35.134 --> 43:40.179
I call him my favorite Nevada Sharpie.

43:40.239 --> 43:43.944
Well, we'll see.

43:43.964 --> 43:49.750
Well, he's not going to—there's already heat at City Hall.

43:50.033 --> 44:00.617
The problem with the books not getting back on the shelves is the librarians exactly sabotage as an effort, I'll tell you what he said,

44:01.188 --> 44:09.578
to build their base and to not allow volunteers to work and do what they want to protect food and cemetery, that would be suggested.

44:09.598 --> 44:11.400
Yeah, yeah, I've heard all that before.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.282
So this has been articulated.

44:13.422 --> 44:13.883
Oh, yeah.

44:13.903 --> 44:17.147
This is really a labor thing, protect my job type of thing.

44:17.227 --> 44:22.493
Well, you know, there's always going to be some of that going on when you have a union involved, and I'll be the first to admit.

44:22.513 --> 44:24.175
Sure, and that perception is going to be there.

44:24.155 --> 44:31.487
Oh, particularly, this was, you know, pre-UPS strike, so, you know, at that point, I'd say union popularity was at its all-time low.

44:31.507 --> 44:32.688
Yeah, it's coming back.

44:32.949 --> 44:37.836
I noticed even here with this BART thing, the people were dealing with it, yeah.

44:37.857 --> 44:39.319
Yeah, they're not condemning the union.

44:39.339 --> 44:42.804
No, and matter of fact, that almost happened last year.

44:42.904 --> 44:47.091
These people worked a whole other year without a contract, so they didn't.

44:47.071 --> 45:09.096
they went back yeah yeah you got a car right you're flying on an airplane uh so so i think that you know i mean the union has an agenda i mean that's just realistic uh but it isn't it isn't what stephen culture says it is so you had a punch list culture would be about fourth culture was fourth on the list you got two out of the four is price still there no he's gone

45:09.397 --> 45:10.498
So you got three out of four.

45:10.518 --> 45:13.762
Got three out of four so far, and we got Coulter on the ropes.

45:13.942 --> 45:14.904
I don't think he knows it.

45:14.924 --> 45:17.467
And you truly believe that it is three records to have been gone.

45:17.887 --> 45:18.248
I know.

45:18.968 --> 45:21.812
It's not just our people, but it's also the librarians.

45:21.852 --> 45:22.973
They had a lot to do with it.

45:23.834 --> 45:26.337
And why the accountant?

45:26.417 --> 45:27.619
That's a whole story.

45:28.940 --> 45:30.522
There's an article in here about him.

45:30.943 --> 45:35.488
He's the guy that, basically, Dallin brought him in to break the union.

45:36.329 --> 46:03.636
and uh and uh by by a downside because he him and dowlin were playing were playing games with the money and that's where they came up with the story that there wasn't enough money for labor there was there was too much labor at the library can we take a fast break oh yeah i have to i have to go water and the coffee yeah get off there yeah big houses so so then we uh okay so this is uh about the time that we made that list uh

46:03.802 --> 46:13.817
And at that first meeting in, you know, 96, June, July, August, in that period, we put together this little brochure.

46:13.837 --> 46:14.978
I don't know if you've seen that.

46:14.998 --> 46:15.098
Nope.

46:15.118 --> 46:19.224
That's the first piece of compiled problems.

46:19.305 --> 46:20.126
It's the first list.

46:20.146 --> 46:21.808
And there's about five or six things on there.

46:21.848 --> 46:30.841
And there, you know, Brooks Hall and, you know, some problems that have been fessed up to now.

46:30.861 --> 46:31.362
So I think...

46:31.527 --> 46:33.849
Except for Brooks Hall, which is still an open question.

46:34.170 --> 46:38.974
Basically, that pamphlet was kind of a worksheet for what we had to accomplish.

46:39.735 --> 46:42.057
We had to promote these things and then make the change.

46:42.938 --> 46:54.029
One of the reasons that we were really focused on Dallin and Paige, particularly Paige, and this is why she was number two on the list and somebody like Coulter wasn't, was because we were losing books.

46:54.990 --> 47:00.555
And, you know, there was this whole business of, look, let's stop the hemorrhaging, you know.

47:00.839 --> 47:08.153
Because we can always go back and do the political work later, but let's stop the hemorrhaging of the collections, because that's going away.

47:08.233 --> 47:08.794
That's real.

47:08.894 --> 47:10.798
Everything else is just so much bullshit.

47:10.818 --> 47:14.084
Did you ever consider yourself a political person?

47:14.184 --> 47:21.177
I mean, I've always been involved in these kinds of things, but nothing like this.

47:21.157 --> 47:25.102
perfectly appropriate to what seems to be in the San Francisco.

47:25.122 --> 47:26.324
Yeah, well, I'm from D.C.

47:27.485 --> 47:29.168
You know, I don't know.

47:29.188 --> 47:36.718
I grew up with the Washington Post, and I hung out with people like Josh Broder, you know, Broder's kid, you know.

47:37.399 --> 47:43.507
And I've been in some landlord-tenant things, but I've never been anything like this.

47:43.527 --> 47:46.611
I don't think any of us ever have.

47:46.631 --> 47:47.933
I mean, where would you place yourself?

47:47.973 --> 47:48.974
Except for maybe Kerwin.

47:49.334 --> 47:49.715
Kerwin.

47:49.815 --> 47:50.556
Kerwin, definitely.

47:50.603 --> 47:51.524
He's a hard core.

47:51.564 --> 47:53.145
Yeah, yeah.

47:53.165 --> 47:53.746
He's a trip.

47:54.166 --> 47:58.631
Oh, it's psychedelic stuff on the wall.

47:58.651 --> 48:00.152
That's a house you have to visit.

48:00.272 --> 48:00.973
He's a trip.

48:01.313 --> 48:02.434
Yeah, right.

48:02.454 --> 48:03.615
No, I love Kerwood.

48:03.675 --> 48:07.879
And Gillespie, he's a politico, you know.

48:07.899 --> 48:09.401
I mean, he's been doing his stuff.

48:09.421 --> 48:12.504
But I don't know, you know, I don't even know if Gillespie had this kind of thing.

48:12.524 --> 48:14.806
Realistically, I asked if the librarians did.

48:15.627 --> 48:19.210
You know, all right, we've got a situation here.

48:19.527 --> 48:33.006
Yeah, and I've also heard the idea of, you know, let's take back over the Asian Art Museum.

48:33.026 --> 48:34.027
It ain't gonna happen.

48:34.568 --> 48:36.891
So, what for you was a realistic thing?

48:37.712 --> 48:43.240
To put Brooks Hall together as a working research library.

48:43.642 --> 48:48.207
So make that a permanent part of the life.

48:48.227 --> 48:57.277
Yeah, put in the basic environmental controls and put in a staircase and an elevator and run with it.

48:57.297 --> 49:00.341
You know, we have, hey, you know, we're lucky that damn thing's there.

49:00.941 --> 49:01.842
That's all I can say.

49:01.983 --> 49:04.425
Only in San Francisco would something like that be there.

49:05.466 --> 49:08.890
You know, I mean, that's... It's like finding Hitler's bunker.

49:09.151 --> 49:10.392
I swear.

49:10.827 --> 49:12.669
I swear the goddamn thing existed.

49:13.070 --> 49:13.390
I know.

49:13.530 --> 49:14.592
It's an unbelievable thing.

49:14.752 --> 49:21.641
And the thing is, is that what's so interesting is that that's where the Macintosh was rolled out, down there in Brooks Hall.

49:21.661 --> 49:25.105
That was used for computer trade shows back in the late 70s.

49:25.586 --> 49:27.809
So it's like Nick Baker said in his speech.

49:27.829 --> 49:33.176
He says, you know, Brooks Hall, where in prehistoric days they held computer conventions.

49:35.819 --> 49:38.202
You know, that's where the Macintosh was rolled out.

49:38.722 --> 49:41.205
So, I mean, there's quite a history there.

49:41.626 --> 49:52.321
This is all, you know, Moscone Center is, that little Brooks Hall down there used to be, you know, that's what they used before Moscone opened.

49:52.421 --> 49:54.344
I can see it somewhere, by the way.

49:54.364 --> 49:55.185
Moscone Center?

49:55.786 --> 49:55.846
No.

49:55.866 --> 49:57.388
Oh, Brooks Hall.

49:57.689 --> 49:58.791
Yeah, I bet.

49:58.851 --> 50:03.157
I've yet to see Brooks Hall.

50:03.177 --> 50:05.701
Oh, I've demanded it.

50:05.901 --> 50:07.083
I'm banned.

50:08.646 --> 50:09.026
For now.

50:09.046 --> 50:12.111
I don't have an agenda.

50:12.391 --> 50:14.615
I'm seeing Ken Dowlin, by the way.

50:14.635 --> 50:15.496
Yeah, that's amazing.

50:15.816 --> 50:20.263
He still lives here, up there, yeah.

50:20.323 --> 50:23.448
Laguna where Chile is is down here, right?

50:23.468 --> 50:24.810
I think so, yeah.

50:25.313 --> 50:26.414
I can look it up now.

50:26.434 --> 50:28.197
No, I walked past it on the way over it.

50:28.217 --> 50:30.439
Well, Laguna goes all the way to the marina.

50:30.519 --> 50:33.082
He's at the 1200 block, and I saw 900 when I came back.

50:33.163 --> 50:34.384
That's right over here, though.

50:34.404 --> 50:35.225
Yeah, so it's close.

50:35.305 --> 50:35.545
Yeah.

50:35.806 --> 50:37.428
I'm going to be here at 4 o'clock to sit.

50:37.468 --> 50:38.749
Coulter lives right down here, too.

50:38.769 --> 50:44.596
He lives down at Castro, right off of, well, actually, yeah, to visit there, 22 divisions.

50:46.258 --> 50:47.700
Does he live lavishly?

50:47.880 --> 50:49.542
I don't know that he lives lavishly.

50:49.603 --> 50:54.088
I know he owns over $300,000 in Pactol stock, according to the Ethics Commission.

50:54.305 --> 50:57.629
Yeah, well, he wrote, and it's signed by his name in his hands.

50:57.809 --> 50:59.651
You know, that's the thing.

50:59.672 --> 51:07.361
San Francisco's gotten to the point where illegal conflicts like that have become so run-of-the-mill that, you know, it's just not a shock to anybody.

51:08.522 --> 51:11.346
What Coulter's doing is illegal under California state law.

51:11.706 --> 51:20.717
The law of California says not only, he says, Coulter, you know, owning stock in a company that's got a million-dollar contract with a library,

51:21.136 --> 51:31.329
that not only is he, you know, can he not recuse himself on votes having to do with technology contracts, it's illegal for him to even be on the commission.

51:31.789 --> 51:34.192
He does have a million dollar contract with the library.

51:34.212 --> 51:36.535
Well, PAC Bill's phone bill last year was $890,000.

51:36.555 --> 51:40.681
Is that documentation on this?

51:41.001 --> 51:42.483
It's somewhere in here, yeah.

51:42.743 --> 51:43.684
It's all in here.

51:43.704 --> 51:47.329
You're going to, this is a regular fortune on here.

51:47.697 --> 51:54.245
But this year it will be well over that because they've added over 100 terminals, and that was only a partial year because it had only opened in April.

51:54.345 --> 51:58.510
So this year... Where are we going to get that?

51:58.550 --> 51:59.451
That's going to be a hard one.

52:00.853 --> 52:02.776
Regina Menoosiery, maybe?

52:04.778 --> 52:05.679
Might be worth a crap.

52:05.739 --> 52:10.926
I'd love a photocopy of a million-dollar phone bill.

52:12.067 --> 52:14.650
That's a hell of a lot of phone calls.

52:14.710 --> 52:16.152
Of course, it's because of, you know...

52:16.351 --> 52:17.994
A lot of it's the internet stuff.

52:18.134 --> 52:20.698
I don't know if I want to ask her that just yet more.

52:20.718 --> 52:21.599
Yeah, yeah.

52:22.120 --> 52:26.768
It may be that Kathy Bremer or James Chafee.

52:27.369 --> 52:28.370
Have you talked to Chafee?

52:28.851 --> 52:30.834
I'm trying to leave a message.

52:30.975 --> 52:32.417
You're supposed to be a 5 o'clock guy.

52:32.437 --> 52:33.519
He's hard, yeah.

52:33.539 --> 52:35.742
Until he said she's got to make it four.

52:36.103 --> 52:38.106
So I left two messages in.

52:38.542 --> 52:40.825
Please call so we can reschedule.

52:40.905 --> 52:44.669
He's kind of camera shy, but once you start talking to him, it won't be a problem.

52:44.689 --> 52:49.795
I hope the hell he gets his messages, because I'm not going to be able to meet him tonight if I... Yeah, yeah.

52:49.835 --> 52:50.996
He's been at this 20 years.

52:51.997 --> 52:55.421
He's the historian of this thing.

52:55.441 --> 52:56.422
This goes back.

52:57.544 --> 52:59.066
Then I did Cassandra.

52:59.126 --> 53:04.752
I thought I'd just nail you with this while we were here this first time, because this is still ongoing.

53:04.917 --> 53:14.314
This is where I downloaded using the computers, OPAC, using their, what is it called, PAC-2 system, not their DRA system.

53:14.875 --> 53:23.572
And my Mac, I downloaded for 300 hours because it's a... What did you do?

53:23.612 --> 53:24.934
I scrolled out.

53:25.285 --> 53:29.350
300 hours of data from their database, yeah.

53:29.630 --> 53:31.092
Real-time 300 hours?

53:31.112 --> 53:38.962
Real-time 300 hours is the most grueling thing I ever went through, because we wanted to prove that they didn't have as many folks as they said they did.

53:41.085 --> 53:50.997
Yeah, we came up, they claim that there are between 2.1 and 2.5 million, depending on who you ask and what week, in the system this is now.

53:51.017 --> 53:52.018
This is the whole system.

53:52.387 --> 54:01.957
And I came up with about, my first go-round, I came up with 900,000, which is, you know, pretty troubling.

54:02.858 --> 54:06.482
Of course, now bear in mind, that doesn't mean a book is or isn't in the library.

54:06.562 --> 54:08.284
It just means it isn't on OPAC.

54:09.526 --> 54:15.272
But I just, so then I revised the figures a little later when I found out I missed some data.

54:15.623 --> 54:22.015
I missed about 30% of the data, so the numbers actually wants to sit at about 1.3, 1.2, somewhere in there.

54:22.296 --> 54:23.197
Still a million shy.

54:23.217 --> 54:25.882
Still a million shy, which is good enough for government work.

54:26.283 --> 54:28.106
Did you present these numbers to them?

54:28.127 --> 54:29.289
Yeah, I did this report.

54:29.890 --> 54:31.453
Did they respond to it?

54:31.833 --> 54:32.074
No.

54:32.795 --> 54:35.060
As a matter of fact, I kept waiting and waiting and waiting.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.923
Here's the actual worksheet on it.

54:37.257 --> 54:41.804
And this is the Chronicle featured it on the front page of the Bay Area section.

54:42.004 --> 54:44.087
They gave me a ton of stuff that I haven't said.

54:44.107 --> 54:46.731
That story should probably be in there, right?

54:46.751 --> 54:47.492
Oh, I would think.

54:47.552 --> 54:48.433
Is this for me to take?

54:48.453 --> 54:49.054
That's for you.

54:49.255 --> 54:51.899
Actually, there's backing files in here on that and everything.

54:52.159 --> 54:53.581
That's quite an interesting project.

54:53.922 --> 54:57.006
So then I had these huge files.

54:57.527 --> 55:05.138
See, it's because the way that system works, their modems are only like 2,400 bought.

55:05.489 --> 55:09.895
So, I mean, it just, I would, and plus the thing clicks you off after an hour.

55:10.757 --> 55:13.681
So I had to devise the system.

55:14.081 --> 55:26.720
I know many more than that, because some of these files are so big, but you get into the later years, like 1990s, and you're dealing with like 10,000 titles, and this is capturing each item of each title.

55:27.661 --> 55:29.744
Sometimes it would take... You got all that data?

55:29.764 --> 55:30.706
Yeah.

55:30.726 --> 55:31.046
Where is it now?

55:31.066 --> 55:32.408
It's sitting on my hard drive.

55:32.860 --> 55:35.583
Yeah, I have... Have you got every title or every one?

55:36.044 --> 55:37.766
Of the ones I downloaded, yeah.

55:37.866 --> 55:48.460
I never went back and... I mean, it's unfortunately... Who's supposed to... Who should... Then I gave this data to Kasim, and Kasim crunched the data on a Unix supercomputer.

55:49.060 --> 55:49.901
So all that's in there.

55:49.941 --> 55:52.164
You'll be able to figure it all out from what's in there.

55:52.204 --> 55:52.885
You're welcome to that.

55:52.905 --> 55:54.387
I'm done with that project.

55:54.407 --> 55:59.273
The report was prepared by the Allman, I guess, after the school publisher of local... That's my newsletter.

55:59.540 --> 56:03.670
My chronicle writing life as they see it.

56:05.073 --> 56:08.141
That's true.

56:08.321 --> 56:10.807
You know, I think they met well.

56:11.027 --> 56:18.004
And that is what led to the administration starting to tell people it's a flawed study.

56:18.119 --> 56:20.883
And that's why Mike Sugarman went and did that piece.

56:21.163 --> 56:30.616
And he, of course, found four out of ten books that by all rights should have been in the library, which is actually a little lower number than what Mike Cassandra would have shown.

56:31.176 --> 56:32.618
So, you know, the flood.

56:32.638 --> 56:34.080
And then there was another study, too.

56:34.100 --> 56:37.665
There was a thing called a fill rate study that was done right about the same time.

56:37.685 --> 56:38.046
You did that, too.

56:38.066 --> 56:38.646
I didn't do that.

56:38.687 --> 56:40.689
That's done by the California Library.

56:40.789 --> 56:43.393
How much time have you put into this?

56:43.413 --> 56:43.553
Has it?

56:43.820 --> 56:46.083
Basically, it has occupied your life.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.324
Yeah, pretty much.

56:47.344 --> 56:48.726
What does your wife say about this?

56:48.746 --> 56:50.248
Well, I'm able to do everything else, too.

56:50.288 --> 56:52.190
I just work really fast.

56:52.330 --> 56:53.431
I get up early and work fast.

56:53.471 --> 56:59.538
I've been in school, and I've got a 4.0 average, so I've kept to the main task.

57:00.179 --> 57:02.001
What do you expect to do?

57:02.162 --> 57:04.664
I've kind of put history on the back burner this year.

57:04.885 --> 57:07.508
And where are you in terms of finishing law school?

57:07.528 --> 57:09.590
Oh, well, I still have to get my BA.

57:09.610 --> 57:13.675
I haven't even got my BA, but I'll be, by 2001,

57:13.823 --> 57:16.066
That's what he thought of me.

57:16.086 --> 57:16.366
38.

57:16.967 --> 57:19.970
So you'll be starting in the year of your 40s.

57:19.990 --> 57:21.732
Yeah, second career.

57:21.752 --> 57:22.954
And the first career having been?

57:23.715 --> 57:29.341
I guess I've been a historian and a preservationist.

57:31.224 --> 57:35.589
To me, my life working has always been something that I did to make money.

57:35.889 --> 57:40.995
And everything else I did was what people know me for and what I actually do.

57:41.465 --> 57:47.931
Like, for instance, these books, this is all San Francisco history, and this is almost all San Francisco history.

57:47.951 --> 57:48.632
Now, how about books?

57:48.672 --> 57:50.114
Did you have any books from the library here?

57:50.854 --> 57:53.737
I have a little shelf full up there that are discards.

57:53.917 --> 57:54.578
Those over there?

57:54.698 --> 58:00.104
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's the same kind of stuff you might have seen at teaches, but I didn't see any of teaches.

58:00.384 --> 58:00.904
Oh, okay.

58:00.924 --> 58:03.707
I mean, she's got a garage full of stuff.

58:03.727 --> 58:04.548
Let me just take a picture of you.

58:04.588 --> 58:05.649
Let me get you with you in there.

58:05.669 --> 58:07.471
Yeah, it's just a shelf right here.

58:09.173 --> 58:11.455
You know, I didn't want to get into that.

58:12.346 --> 58:14.509
On TV, they say I have a lot of books.

58:14.829 --> 58:16.851
You know, you heard me say I had a lot of books.

58:16.871 --> 58:17.272
They did, yeah.

58:17.372 --> 58:19.214
And some very real ones, they said, too.

58:19.234 --> 58:28.966
Yeah, and that's true, but I don't have a lot of books, but I do have some rare ones.

58:28.986 --> 58:30.307
But those are all books.

58:30.327 --> 58:37.816
This one here is particularly... That book, Gladiola Garden, was written in Washington, D.C.

58:37.936 --> 58:41.340
in 1943 by Effie Lee Newsome, who is a black

58:42.400 --> 58:46.387
woman artist and illustrator.

58:47.108 --> 58:50.274
And they don't even have that in DC public.

58:51.696 --> 58:54.842
That was the last copy here.

58:54.902 --> 58:56.104
That's a self-published book.

58:56.124 --> 58:58.007
There's probably only 500 of them in the world.

58:58.428 --> 58:59.610
It's a wonderful book.

58:59.630 --> 59:02.455
Well, we should probably get the bibliographical stuff on that.

59:02.776 --> 59:04.379
So why don't you sit there?

59:04.860 --> 59:06.282
Well, this is Grand Central.

59:06.818 --> 59:07.539
I got it here.

59:07.639 --> 59:09.061
I'll do you a favor.

59:09.121 --> 59:09.882
I set this up.

59:09.902 --> 59:13.127
I was going to show you that OPAC, but we don't have time to do that.

59:13.147 --> 59:13.968
You pretty much know.

59:13.988 --> 59:17.433
We might have to get together, you and I towards the... No, that'd be fine.

59:17.453 --> 59:17.753
Again.

59:17.813 --> 59:22.300
This is the San Francisco... I'll give you a quickie on this little thing right here.

59:22.360 --> 59:25.925
We call this the FTG Forest ripoff guy.

59:27.006 --> 59:28.989
This is Dallin's logo for the library.

59:29.029 --> 59:32.174
He got rid of the old logo that the library had.

59:32.194 --> 59:33.876
This is kind of old and traditional.

59:34.577 --> 59:36.640
I didn't like it that much anyway, but then he got this.

59:36.822 --> 59:42.468
Then he came up with a slogan, and this kicks me in the butt, access, discover, and power.

59:43.028 --> 59:49.615
I can go on and on about subject and object, but access is, the last I checked, anyway, access is a noun.

59:49.695 --> 59:52.358
That is really a very bizarre drawing.

59:52.679 --> 59:53.680
Access is a noun.

59:56.422 --> 59:58.124
This is the most illiterate.

59:58.144 --> 59:58.905
Can you check that out?

59:59.566 --> 01:00:00.326
Oh, sure.

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.147
Yeah.

01:00:01.167 --> 01:00:06.593
I mean, you know, I looked at that the other, actually, my friend Andrew, who's British,

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:11.223
calls you up one day and he says, hey, I never saw that library store.

01:00:12.044 --> 01:00:15.089
He goes, first of all, access is a noun, damn it.

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:19.435
And he says, who's accessing and who's empowering?

01:00:19.475 --> 01:00:20.757
You don't empower yourself.

01:00:20.797 --> 01:00:22.039
You empower somebody else.

01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:23.682
The subject's all screwed up.

01:00:24.863 --> 01:00:25.865
And I said, well, hey.

01:00:25.885 --> 01:00:27.327
Well, I can get this, too, right?

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:28.229
Oh, it's on everything.

01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:30.131
Yeah, but I can log into this.

01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:31.614
This is their website?

01:00:31.634 --> 01:00:31.914
Yeah.

01:00:31.954 --> 01:00:33.296
But print it out, if you don't mind.

01:00:33.416 --> 01:00:35.179
Actually, let me...

01:00:36.712 --> 01:00:39.038
Let me put the location in there, too.

01:00:41.143 --> 01:00:41.865
Yeah.

01:00:41.885 --> 01:00:43.128
Hopefully it'll show the location.

01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:45.574
There it is, sfl.lid.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:53.674
Yes.
