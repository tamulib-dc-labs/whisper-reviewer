00:02.174 --> 00:09.741
We're talking about Shen, and I don't know exactly where you want to go, but just let me say something about him as a person.

00:10.962 --> 00:11.923
Is he James?

00:12.804 --> 00:17.869
James Shen is, I think, his real name is the one he's consistently used.

00:18.129 --> 00:18.890
And how does he spell it?

00:19.531 --> 00:20.311
S-H-I-N-N.

00:20.331 --> 00:25.716
And actually, I probably have more detailed information.

00:25.736 --> 00:28.279
I could probably figure out when he was born and so forth, if I could go.

00:28.299 --> 00:29.320
I don't think that's what he said.

00:29.540 --> 00:30.561
But the fact is that

00:31.013 --> 00:43.126
When we encountered him in Oberlin in 1981, he was in his early 40s and had not yet been arrested.

00:43.186 --> 00:49.293
He had been involved, like Blumberg, was later to be involved in entering libraries all across the country.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.895
He spent a lot of time in libraries.

00:52.816 --> 00:54.898
He had a finding list.

00:54.919 --> 00:58.202
As a matter of fact, I have some of his finding lists with me.

00:58.823 --> 01:28.257
and uh which he had compiled from from uh 80 bookman's weekly and from uh sales catalogs so trying to find what would be desirable what went for money and then he would simply go to libraries and he would look for those things and then if they were not in special collections but on the open shelves he would contrive to get them out to remove the marks ownership and to sell them and when when he was arrested at oakland he had been doing this for several years and had had major

01:28.675 --> 01:38.347
thefts from UCLA and from Johns Hopkins and from Penn and from all across the country, everywhere in between, from his using St.

01:38.367 --> 01:39.128
Louis as a base.

01:40.029 --> 01:42.131
He had taken courses at the St.

01:42.151 --> 01:51.022
Louis Botanical Gardens in bookbinding, so he fasted himself able to repair the damage that would be caused from removing marks of ownership.

01:51.082 --> 01:55.307
And indeed, those that he couldn't be removed, he would simply stamp over them up.

01:55.945 --> 02:24.130
uh with the reverend stamp of his own making uh withdrawn or something or stamp of yet another misleading stamp of some library that he knew to be defunct so he could he could pass these off as books that had them why do you think that you think fundamentally he was a thief who loved books or why would he pick books as something to steal i mean i go back to the quote and the piece i had in the times you know why why not something more liquid like that well i think that's where i should tell you a little bit about him because he when he was arrested there

02:24.329 --> 02:48.835
uh i got involved spending an awful lot of time trying to find out who he was because though he was arrested and although immediately from the evidence that we had there which we found in his his room and his cards or we knew an awful lot about we knew that in fact this was a big big time thief but uh he immediately jumped bail disappeared we couldn't get the st louis police to stop him in st louis while he packed up all of his books

02:49.068 --> 03:17.404
trunks and boxes of them and then something disappeared this was in the early 80s early 80s and you and you were in what capacity at overland um and you're doing what as director of libraries at overland so i knew nothing about the field or anything else and i i was trying to find out several things one is who was this guy and where was he what had he been doing where had he gone where did he get what libraries had been involved and how do you how do you cope with something like this so i got deeply involved in all those aspects antiquarian books antiquarian book sellers

03:18.025 --> 03:25.656
read books librarians, all that sort of thing, which as a British historian and as an administrator I'd never really been involved in before.

03:26.377 --> 03:47.509
He was ultimately re-arrested in Pennsylvania when a librarian saw a photograph that I had distributed and called me and we arranged for the FBI to stake him out and ultimately he was arrested, tried in Third Circuit, Federal Circuit Court in Philadelphia and sentenced to two consecutive ten-year

03:47.810 --> 04:16.703
terms uh in in federal prison a hefty sentence because he had been guilty he'd been found guilty on other occasions of violating federal statutes so that's why what the charges were uh in the case of of the our prosecution it was for uh possession and transportation transportation uh which is the easiest thing to prove they don't have to prove that he stole them or how he did it but they just have to prove that he had which of course he couldn't deny um

04:16.987 --> 04:24.216
In fact, his whole defense hinged on whether or not he had been, his civil rights had been, constitutional rights had been violated in his arrest.

04:24.637 --> 04:36.913
In any event, he then went to prison, served with good, and with good behavior, got out at the end of a third of his terms.

04:37.013 --> 04:42.420
In other words, he served three and a third years for each of the 210s, so he was out after six and two-thirds years.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.783
So he's been out now for some time.

04:45.505 --> 04:52.933
During that time, we maintained some minor contact because he had held out.

04:53.514 --> 04:55.256
We tried to find out more information.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.617
We wanted to know how he operated.

04:56.658 --> 04:57.659
We wanted to know who he sold to.

04:57.679 --> 05:05.547
We wanted to know how suspicious dealers had been when we thought they might have been a lot more suspicious.

05:05.568 --> 05:10.233
They had been unloading, fencing his books in the trade for a number of years.

05:11.134 --> 05:14.938
And our first suspicions were that dealers would not look too carefully.

05:15.678 --> 05:18.963
I've since modified that view.

05:19.003 --> 05:24.732
I think they were, but some of the, some of the trades he made were about a male, and some people didn't see him at all.

05:25.053 --> 05:26.876
What was the quality of the stuff that he was doing?

05:26.896 --> 05:43.542
Well, he was doing the kinds of things that, in the early 19th century, views, voyages and discoveries, flora, posthums, all sorts of things, that would have, that would have been standing up pretty well and not used very heavily in college and academic libraries.

05:44.213 --> 06:10.103
and uh they would have marks of ownership that was a big thing getting the marks of ownership off if they were in clean shape they were pretty good and it was pre-1850 stuff for the most part so it was uh rag paper so it was standing up pretty well bindings were usually pretty good and he had made himself uh as it turns out in prison fairly knowledgeable about this i mean he had educated himself about about books and about the book trade and about libraries he didn't think librarians

06:10.420 --> 06:12.403
had a clue as to how valuable the stuff was.

06:12.423 --> 06:13.123
He couldn't believe it.

06:13.143 --> 06:15.166
You just go in and walk out with it and sell it.

06:15.266 --> 06:19.932
I mean, he assumed that if it was worth money, it would have taken better care of it.

06:19.952 --> 06:28.063
So, as a matter of fact, he was coaxed to think he could write a security essay or something, maybe even talk to librarians about improving.

06:28.083 --> 06:38.376
And this would be something we encouraged him to think he could do this because we wanted to keep contact with him so that perhaps he would be helpful in telling us information.

06:38.456 --> 06:39.297
Yeah, sure.

06:39.665 --> 06:43.229
Though that's never really worked out, we maintained sort of friendly terms.

06:43.269 --> 06:53.901
I had always treated him with respect, even from the time we arrested him, and he himself is very mild-mannered and very polite, so we really hadn't had a problem.

06:54.101 --> 07:03.151
And after he got out of prison, and I was going to speak at the Society of American Archivists meeting, which just happened to be meeting in St.

07:03.171 --> 07:08.237
Louis, and they would ask me to give a talk on library and archival security,

07:08.622 --> 07:37.313
since Shin because we had his arrest and and the notoriety of that case and a lot of other things led to a number of uh of uh reforms in the library and uh rare books area uh i mean and aquarium booksellers area we had had conferences we had guidelines we had we developed bam bam uh there were all these things that had been been created to help do a better job of combating crime and a lot of them had to do with uh with with Shin and we had a big

07:37.597 --> 08:03.368
first national conference on library security was held at uh at overland i was one of the co-chairs uh sponsored by the by the rare books and manuscript section of of the acro and the uh the antiquarian booksellers association of america the abaa and we brought fbi and interpol and archivists and everybody together and we've begun to really get a little higher profile and

08:03.770 --> 08:08.577
and helped boost sensitivity and awareness and sort of raising consciousness and raising standards.

08:09.038 --> 08:21.837
And meanwhile, then, a security committee within the rare books and manuscripts section of the ALA's academic division began to develop these guidelines and give people advice on how to deal with these issues.

08:22.217 --> 08:30.229
So Shen had provoked, or helped him provoked, because of his tremendous visibility, a lot of reforms.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.713
And in fact, I always thought we should be very grateful to him.

08:33.082 --> 08:36.167
Can I just interrupt?

08:36.187 --> 08:36.587
Yeah.

08:37.048 --> 08:40.033
Was there ever any value, any rough estimate of what he did?

08:40.493 --> 08:44.820
Yeah, because we, but it's just like the Bloomberg thing where it's been terribly inflated.

08:45.621 --> 08:49.267
The only way you can really put a value on those things is actually to try to sell them and see what they go for.

08:49.287 --> 08:49.888
Right, exactly.

08:50.308 --> 08:54.956
And we banded about three quarters of a million dollars, but it's really sort of hard to say.

08:54.976 --> 08:59.903
And you never did figure out, you never nailed any of the people that he sold to?

09:00.704 --> 09:01.165
Well,

09:01.533 --> 09:04.336
I understood that he was probably being stuck on contract.

09:04.356 --> 09:05.196
We did, in fact.

09:05.557 --> 09:07.479
I don't think there was any evidence of that.

09:07.519 --> 09:12.784
But he would see somebody writing a warrant list, and he would go out and try to get it, and then say, well, I happen to have that, you know.

09:13.144 --> 09:17.248
But I don't think he was a hard gun for anyone.

09:18.149 --> 09:20.751
It's not like taking Vermeer out of the Gardner Museum.

09:20.871 --> 09:21.312
That's right.

09:21.432 --> 09:24.635
Not quite the same thing.

09:27.918 --> 09:31.101
Since he pled guilty without ever going to trial,

09:31.790 --> 09:39.499
His defense was in a preliminary hearing where he tried to argue that the case against him was flawed because we had violated his constitutional rights.

09:43.864 --> 09:46.186
That our search warrant wasn't proper or something.

09:46.987 --> 09:50.892
And we were able to defend everything we did to the satisfaction of the judge.

09:51.352 --> 09:52.814
So once that happened, then he pled guilty.

09:52.854 --> 09:55.837
So several things didn't happen.

09:56.038 --> 09:58.440
They never had to have a full count of what he did.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.822
They didn't have to bring...

10:00.106 --> 10:05.413
witnesses like that did the Blumberg case and had to make statements about how valuable this was, how important.

10:05.433 --> 10:06.936
He simply threw in the towel.

10:07.556 --> 10:11.202
So we didn't have that kind of information.

10:11.222 --> 10:23.879
But at that point, he was regarded as the number one American book thief of all time because no one had apparently had sold so many books and had hit so many libraries.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.603
And for that matter, without anybody really knowing

10:26.887 --> 10:30.733
I mean, they had been hit, and they knew they had these losses that some of them would report.

10:30.954 --> 10:32.316
Are you finding that one, by the way?

10:32.777 --> 10:34.600
Many of them didn't actually know they'd been so.

10:35.141 --> 10:38.025
Well, that gets into more of an aggression.

10:38.065 --> 10:43.675
I just happened to see him in the library, got my suspicions up, had him arrested, and then one thing led to another.

10:44.316 --> 10:51.848
And Phil left it after he'd been in hiding, and he wandered into a library because he couldn't stay away.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.133
And they spotted me because they saw it.

10:54.233 --> 10:55.654
I had circulated this picture.

10:55.674 --> 10:57.195
I published it widely in all the libraries.

10:57.216 --> 10:59.958
Now, why did you become so involved in this?

11:00.519 --> 11:02.340
Oh, I just thought it was fascinating.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.682
And it was a learning experience.

11:03.702 --> 11:05.183
There was so much about it that I didn't know.

11:06.084 --> 11:11.208
And we had so much evidence that we seized that indicated that he had been to a number of libraries.

11:11.229 --> 11:12.289
And I would call them and say, you know.

11:12.310 --> 11:13.451
Maybe nobody else is doing this.

11:13.471 --> 11:13.871
You're doing this.

11:13.891 --> 11:14.051
No, no.

11:14.091 --> 11:20.417
It was just, it became, it became, as some people become obsessive about collecting books, I began to collect book thieves.

11:20.937 --> 11:22.779
And that became my obsession.

11:22.819 --> 11:27.264
So I, as a result, I have files, just tons of files on cases.

11:27.284 --> 11:29.066
Just give it a little book, I can tell you right now.

11:30.367 --> 11:30.888
Of cases.

11:31.048 --> 11:35.673
So I've tended to collect information on any number of cases, even going back into time.

11:36.474 --> 11:49.729
And became very knowledgeable about the whole subject historically as a phenomenon, and began even to be regarded as something of an expert in library security, even though I've never myself

11:50.435 --> 11:51.216
made that claim.

11:51.256 --> 12:00.889
I mean quite often enough people will bring me in because I haven't gathered so much information that I'm perhaps of some use in a conversation, but I don't think of myself as an expert.

12:00.909 --> 12:03.693
But all this is by way of digression to say that when I went to St.

12:04.374 --> 12:15.088
Louis then to talk about how much we had improved things since Shin, Shin is out on parole, and so I contrived to have him meet my plane at St.

12:15.108 --> 12:16.530
Louis.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.834
We wanted to meet someplace where we could talk and the airport

12:20.422 --> 12:47.003
coffee shop seemed like a good place because he could see me get off the plane i mean you can see all around you know you're not going to be bugged i could see him and i'd have to work he's a big guy six foot three maybe he's a big guy and and i was by myself had you met him before this obviously i had tackling uh was um but um i was at some risk as well particularly my wife felt that this is foolhard because if he really

12:47.573 --> 12:55.123
had a sense of revenge, this would be a good chance to pay me back for having just spent seven years in the pokey.

12:55.143 --> 13:06.097
But, so we went in the pokey place, and we spent about three hours there, and talked, as you were able to talk to the public, I talked a lot, although it was very candid and so forth.

13:06.117 --> 13:14.728
I knew more about him than anybody else, probably, except his family members knew, because I'd, you know, I'd poke through his papers and so forth, so I knew an awful lot about him.

13:14.911 --> 13:16.893
Do you remember when you heard this was again, by the way?

13:16.953 --> 13:20.358
This would have been in 87, I guess, when that conference was.

13:21.979 --> 13:25.163
I think it was 87, yeah.

13:25.183 --> 13:26.204
Well, 87 or 88, I forget now.

13:26.225 --> 13:27.426
I'm a little out of here.

13:27.967 --> 13:31.311
Let's go back and look.

13:31.331 --> 13:36.257
But the, oh, I, I, I, here's to do that at the conference.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.019
It's not much.

13:38.039 --> 13:41.202
It's not a set that I had, certainly spent an awful lot of time.

13:41.222 --> 13:43.926
I'm coming over here so I can pick you up.

13:43.946 --> 13:44.226
Something's

13:45.455 --> 13:48.580
This is a book, by the way, of showing one of his cutters.

13:48.800 --> 14:00.877
And these are the kinds of files he would make from American book files, his current, just to show what things were going for.

14:00.938 --> 14:04.583
And then he would go in the library with a handful of these and just see if they had them.

14:04.603 --> 14:07.507
He was so unsophisticated that this was a symbol for pound.

14:08.529 --> 14:13.296
And it would deploy instead of monetary.

14:13.596 --> 14:14.297
But wait.

14:14.902 --> 14:35.332
I had published a list of all the cards that we found, because there were hundreds of these cards, and so we wanted people to see what was he had, and I actually gave pictures of some of them.

14:35.753 --> 14:42.563
These are the ones that he had with the notes about how they would have to be cleaned up.

14:43.100 --> 14:46.224
Back inside cover has glue from pocket that I can't get off.

14:46.604 --> 14:47.845
Maybe cover with a book plate.

14:48.807 --> 14:50.328
Are there any other copies of this?

14:51.049 --> 14:56.115
I don't think I have any other copies left, but I'll be glad to lend this to you.

14:56.295 --> 15:02.062
I had become really quite... I knew not awful lot about him.

15:02.082 --> 15:03.163
I knew his handwriting.

15:03.183 --> 15:04.945
I knew lots about him as a person.

15:04.965 --> 15:07.588
That also was evident evidence, by the way, at the Bloomberg trial.

15:07.855 --> 15:08.416
The Schindlers.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.638
Stephen had a copy of that.

15:10.758 --> 15:13.121
He stole a copy of that from one of the libraries.

15:13.281 --> 15:14.102
That's amazing.

15:14.542 --> 15:15.183
That's amazing.

15:15.263 --> 15:16.585
I saw that.

15:16.605 --> 15:17.225
He took that out.

15:17.245 --> 15:17.946
I recognized that.

15:17.966 --> 15:21.490
Well, so I knew a lot about him.

15:21.530 --> 15:24.293
So we could talk, and I learned even more about him.

15:24.453 --> 15:25.655
I feel very sympathetic to him.

15:25.715 --> 15:26.476
He's a con man.

15:28.638 --> 15:29.759
You do feel sympathetic.

15:29.919 --> 15:30.580
Well, you can't help.

15:31.441 --> 15:34.124
A lot of his colleagues would hang these guys from their toes, you know.

15:34.464 --> 15:36.867
Well, yes, but see, these guys, I mean,

15:37.673 --> 15:44.899
Both Blumberg and Shen are sympathetic characters.

15:44.919 --> 15:52.886
The people that I got a passion for are the librarians and the scholars who steal, and they're much more likely to be a problem.

15:52.946 --> 15:55.689
I mean, people like Shen are fairly easy to stop.

15:55.889 --> 16:00.413
I mean, you can either spot them coming in or you can arrest them in the trade.

16:01.334 --> 16:03.596
They ought to have been able to spot Blumberg a mile away.

16:03.656 --> 16:04.156
They didn't.

16:04.176 --> 16:06.398
They had him on Riverside and let him go, too.

16:06.749 --> 16:30.214
It's the expert, and I don't want to describe this too carefully, because the way you print, some of your readers will know, and maybe people, in fact, you know, who come in here and who use the collection and manage to work a few manuscripts in their release when they leave, or people who pocket a rare book, or librarians who do this.

16:30.254 --> 16:35.980
And I would say that of all the professions who steal books, that librarians are as

16:36.280 --> 16:39.404
as likely to be guilty of theft as anyone else.

16:39.424 --> 16:41.627
They are in a position to know the value of the books.

16:41.747 --> 16:46.353
They cannot get the book, but they can change the records.

16:47.195 --> 16:49.237
They know where it is.

16:49.277 --> 16:51.981
They know whether or not it's been catalogued or not.

16:52.001 --> 16:53.964
How about the case in Georgia, for instance?

16:53.984 --> 16:56.167
Well, it's a good case of Skeets William in Georgia.

16:56.207 --> 17:04.718
But the fact is that I would be much more concerned, and I'm much more passionate about that betrayal of trust,

17:05.272 --> 17:06.894
And I see much more vulnerability.

17:07.414 --> 17:08.695
And he even removed records.

17:09.196 --> 17:09.797
Yeah, well, of course.

17:09.837 --> 17:11.578
So this document never even existed.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.079
That's right.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.782
They don't even know the things that they've lost.

17:14.802 --> 17:21.228
He gave some of his books to my alma mater, which happens to be the college he went to, he didn't graduate from, Davidson College.

17:21.508 --> 17:31.198
And when they were reluctant to send it back, they said, just prove to us, Georgia, that you own this book.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.860
Of course, Georgia couldn't even prove it.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.581
I thought it was a little churlish of my alma mater.

17:34.601 --> 17:35.262
What's the status on, Steve?

17:35.680 --> 17:36.040
I don't know.

17:36.061 --> 17:37.462
He was sentenced, but I don't know.

17:37.482 --> 17:38.163
He was appealing.

17:38.804 --> 17:40.266
But a lot of these people have mental problems.

17:40.346 --> 17:49.098
I mean, after all, severe problems of morality and honesty tend to be a psychological problem, too.

17:49.138 --> 17:50.439
I mean, it's sort of hard to separate them.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.843
A certain Blumberg had superior problems.

17:52.863 --> 18:01.174
Shen, on the other hand, is sympathetic because he was a bright kid in an unfortunate home, lost his father early.

18:01.194 --> 18:05.299
His mother, I think, I don't know whether they divorced or what, but she remarried.

18:05.532 --> 18:08.196
married a man who didn't get along with Shen.

18:08.216 --> 18:12.482
Shen's a big kid for his age, and they sent him to prep school.

18:13.944 --> 18:16.106
He kept running away.

18:16.167 --> 18:19.832
He just felt, I guess, abandoned or something, whatever he was.

18:20.533 --> 18:28.543
But he was very bright, and he always had a scheme going in, and he got into trouble about smarting himself.

18:29.525 --> 18:34.071
He stole a credit card from somebody, and he used that credit card eight

18:34.321 --> 18:34.902
He stole it.

18:35.182 --> 18:40.128
The reason he sold it was, as he told me, he started selling magazines.

18:40.148 --> 18:41.390
He had to do something for a living.

18:42.371 --> 18:47.137
And he would have a scheme for trying to sell things.

18:47.157 --> 18:50.741
And he would go into these big office flats, and he would just work the office.

18:51.722 --> 18:59.772
And then somewhere along the line, it occurred to him that he knew when the Wall Street Journal came out, say, or something would come out.

19:00.241 --> 19:06.847
that on the mailing sticker, it would not only give the name of the person, but when their subscription would expire.

19:06.887 --> 19:11.692
He would go through, and all the people, he would know that information.

19:11.732 --> 19:15.656
So he would pass himself off as a salesman, let's say the Wall Street Journal.

19:16.036 --> 19:20.580
And he would go to so-and-so, your subscription is going to retire, and such and such, would you like to renew?

19:21.801 --> 19:23.303
And they would say yes.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.204
He said, well, very good.

19:24.224 --> 19:25.645
He had a little phony receipt.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.686
You'll just make your check out.

19:26.706 --> 19:27.767
We'll get it done right now.

19:28.574 --> 19:30.356
And so he would then just pocket the money.

19:30.396 --> 19:33.280
By the time they discovered it, it would be longer.

19:33.300 --> 19:37.085
And once it's time going into an office, there was a meeting or something, the office was empty.

19:37.586 --> 19:39.969
And he just sort of wandered around and looked in drawers.

19:40.330 --> 19:40.750
He told us.

19:41.111 --> 19:47.800
Yes, found a credit card.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.322
This was much earlier.

19:49.342 --> 19:52.226
I forget what the card was, but it enabled him to fly.

19:52.746 --> 19:53.207
He went to St.

19:53.227 --> 19:54.649
Louis and he flew all over the country.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.531
He wouldn't go to a motel.

19:56.551 --> 19:57.012
He would just...

19:57.734 --> 20:02.018
He'd fly, he'd sleep on the plane, he'd eat their plane food, and he'd get to the airport and he'd buy a ticket to somebody else.

20:02.399 --> 20:08.085
He was crisscrossing the country, uh, and becoming very familiar with airports or something that would stand him in good later on.

20:08.906 --> 20:12.770
And, um, he said, trouble with it, he went through Chicago one too many times.

20:12.830 --> 20:16.654
He said, they probably figured out something was up, and they arrested him.

20:16.674 --> 20:21.819
Then he tried to pass himself off as the, as the son of the guy whose credit card was.

20:21.839 --> 20:25.082
I mean, he's, he's just, was just kind of, and he was laughing about all this.

20:25.102 --> 20:26.644
I mean, how naive he was.

20:26.877 --> 20:30.882
What he was showing was that it was always just sort of a game, you know, to outsmarting people.

20:31.683 --> 20:37.870
But one thing led to another, and he was in and out of prison for scams like this, just minor theft.

20:38.631 --> 20:42.335
Quite often it was a federal offense, and so he racked up some federal time.

20:42.355 --> 20:45.318
When he was in, he would spend the whole time in the library reading.

20:46.079 --> 20:56.091
He'd never finished high school, but he was always described as like a college professor, but he was very... He had a tremendous vocabulary, and typical of somebody who goes up

20:56.307 --> 21:03.314
in a prison, he could spell words that he couldn't pronounce because he had never actually heard anybody use those words.

21:03.594 --> 21:09.120
He could use the word, but he didn't know how to pronounce it because he'd never heard it spoken.

21:09.581 --> 21:10.341
It's an interesting case.

21:10.962 --> 21:12.243
But he was a tremendous reader.

21:12.323 --> 21:17.729
His wife, Lola, said that he spent all the time reading.

21:17.749 --> 21:19.611
And he was a very gentle person, never heard anybody.

21:20.572 --> 21:25.757
And basically, they got into a similar scam with antiques,

21:26.362 --> 21:34.890
Antiques led to antiquarian books, and then it certainly occurred to him that these books that everybody was paying big money for, hell, they were just all over the place in these libraries, if you find a way to liberate them.

21:35.571 --> 21:38.574
And it was a way that seemed to be a nonviolent crime.

21:38.614 --> 21:40.676
There was no particular love for books in his plan.

21:41.297 --> 21:42.858
No, but a tremendous love for reading.

21:42.878 --> 21:47.123
I think he was fascinated with that, and he became very interested in reading.

21:47.143 --> 21:50.106
But as far as I know, he didn't keep books for himself.

21:50.326 --> 21:55.491
He found them interesting, but he was mainly getting them so he could then fix them up and sell them.

21:55.893 --> 21:58.116
And he recognized that other people valued him.

21:58.357 --> 21:59.658
And he himself read a great deal.

22:00.299 --> 22:07.289
But there was never anything in his story that suggested that he had a great love for books.

22:07.790 --> 22:08.631
But it was a love of reading.

22:08.731 --> 22:10.334
And, again, he was a sort of a gentle man.

22:11.255 --> 22:12.036
He got out of prison.

22:13.158 --> 22:15.922
The question is, would he, you know, what would he do next?

22:16.923 --> 22:18.746
Of course, he was always a model prisoner.

22:18.866 --> 22:19.927
He made himself so well-read.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.431
He was dealing with a lot of other people in prison who were illiterate.

22:22.851 --> 22:24.634
And so he became a kind of jailhouse lawyer.

22:25.323 --> 22:29.869
In fact, he tried to defend himself in federal court, and fairly successful, because he knew the law.

22:29.970 --> 22:37.861
He had boned up, and particularly in procedural questions, and he would help write briefs for prisoners.

22:37.881 --> 22:39.723
So he would spend his time on a good state.

22:39.944 --> 22:41.045
People would always do him favors.

22:41.065 --> 22:42.187
He never had to lack anything.

22:42.227 --> 22:46.453
It was like living in a country club in a federal prison.

22:46.473 --> 22:49.136
And then, since he was well-behaved, he'd always get out early.

22:49.877 --> 22:53.643
So he didn't seem to have any terrible grits.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.245
I mean, if you get caught, well, you get caught.

22:55.563 --> 22:58.405
wait, learn something, go out and start over again.

22:58.906 --> 23:00.447
His wife, however, died.

23:00.988 --> 23:04.451
He married what I think was a former hooker in St.

23:04.471 --> 23:04.751
Louis.

23:05.732 --> 23:13.479
She died several of either her children, and I think he had one natural child.

23:13.499 --> 23:16.541
But her children all died, and there was a lot of violence involved in those cases.

23:17.002 --> 23:18.123
In one case, an accident.

23:18.403 --> 23:24.068
In another case, I think they were wiped out by a drug dealer who had

23:24.723 --> 23:25.944
they'd gone against or something.

23:26.344 --> 23:36.053
It was terrible, and so he'd come out of prison, and he said, well, you wanted to go straight because his daughter had grown up in Eden without really knowing him, and he wanted to spend some quality time.

23:36.073 --> 23:39.156
And that was the only regret apparently he had had.

23:40.197 --> 23:43.179
He had a job with an industrial security firm.

23:43.199 --> 23:46.582
He had one of their personnel people, supervisor.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.203
That's amazing.

23:48.023 --> 23:48.984
Well, he would know.

23:49.124 --> 23:51.406
I mean, he'd be perfect, and he'd be very good with personnel.

23:51.747 --> 23:52.487
So I don't know how he's doing it.

23:52.507 --> 23:53.228
He hasn't answered

23:53.512 --> 24:00.364
I sent him a couple of the Blumberg clippings where Blumberg made references to it, or was refuted to have made a reference to it.

24:00.685 --> 24:05.413
Well, in one case, it sounded like the guy wrote, inverted what he had said.

24:05.433 --> 24:06.715
No, no, Stephen had a copy of that.

24:07.036 --> 24:08.939
She must.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.362
It was entered in evidence.

24:10.402 --> 24:17.494
And there is evidence that he did say once.

24:17.845 --> 24:22.812
He wanted to go down as the biggest, yeah, he wanted to be even better than shit.

24:22.832 --> 24:26.137
But the question is whether Stephen actually said that or whether that was rude.

24:26.838 --> 24:27.338
Yeah.

24:27.438 --> 24:29.541
Because then I would be suspicious of anything.

24:29.561 --> 24:32.966
Well, this is all over when I'm, I mean, when my book is all done.

24:33.307 --> 24:36.591
I wouldn't have to let you listen to the seven hours of tape with Stephen.

24:36.611 --> 24:37.753
Is that something you'd like to do?

24:38.213 --> 24:40.196
I might want to do that.

24:40.236 --> 24:42.119
They had invited me to, you know, come out and talk to him.

24:42.139 --> 24:45.844
You weren't talking to me, but basically I really wanted to leave initiative with him because

24:46.128 --> 24:49.592
I had nothing to gain and a lot to lose by this.

24:49.692 --> 25:01.624
As a matter of fact, my main interest at one point was, again, trying to get him to be more forthcoming about how he got into Harvard, how he got into some places, because they wouldn't attempt to prove that, but it would be useful to know.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.567
And so I was trying to hold out some way in which he could be helpful.

25:04.587 --> 25:12.355
He's kind of hoping that there's part of the seducing deal, that in return for whatever,

25:12.824 --> 25:16.329
Well, I think so, because they still want to know how the books go.

25:17.010 --> 25:21.858
But he's willing to help them with that and also to serve as some kind of a consultant to tell them how he did it.

25:22.018 --> 25:26.785
Yeah, well, if he could have done that beforehand, but I don't think that's going to help him much.

25:26.805 --> 25:28.989
I don't think they're going to make it that conditional.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.972
Because he won't be able to prove that he can do it.

25:31.272 --> 25:37.241
If he had done it before sentencing, as an act of good faith, then I think they'd more like to do it.

25:37.261 --> 25:40.907
But I think they've blown that opportunity by not doing it before sentencing.

25:41.343 --> 25:45.288
I don't think the judge is going to say, now, we'll let you off so much if you do these things.

25:45.368 --> 25:46.509
I don't think the judge is going to.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.912
I think it's a major miscalculation.

25:48.932 --> 25:53.879
Tell me, with all this Shin's background, he was living in St.

25:53.919 --> 25:54.239
Louis?

25:56.021 --> 25:56.522
Right.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.404
Let's come up to Bloomberg now.

25:58.504 --> 26:10.159
With that as prolonged, do you see the Bloomberg case as the great example of the real kleptomania in the American 20th century?

26:10.539 --> 26:11.080
I really...

26:11.667 --> 26:22.161
I really do, because statistically, there's been no one who has stolen more books from more libraries than Blumberg.

26:23.122 --> 26:26.907
There have been some who have stolen, who have been much more high profile.

26:27.488 --> 26:40.645
I mean, Charles Merrill Mount, stealing books from the National Archives, and there are a whole series of people we could cite who worked their scams at Yale, or the National Archives Library of Congress, some big time operators.

26:41.536 --> 26:50.568
But the quantity and the number of things they stole were really quite insignificant in terms of this pile that Steve and John.

26:51.048 --> 27:06.188
Now, there are some other people who were Cleptomaniac who liked this character over at, I think this was also Riverside, several years ago, who simply took library books out of all types and he simply filled his room, his house, his garage, and so forth.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.089
He was a nut.

27:07.109 --> 27:10.834
And when it was obvious that they were coming after him, his mother,

27:11.371 --> 27:16.737
contrived to have a truck loaded up and take him and drop him to the landfill to try to destroy the evidence.

27:17.317 --> 27:23.124
And so thousands of books, at least 10,000 volumes, were plowed into a landfill before the bulldozer operated notice.

27:23.144 --> 27:24.625
So something different.

27:24.645 --> 27:25.866
These were all library books.

27:25.886 --> 27:28.349
But again, this was anything he came up with.

27:28.369 --> 27:30.331
He was just an indiscriminate collector.

27:30.351 --> 27:31.352
He was an accumulator.

27:31.392 --> 27:33.815
He was an accumulator, and he was a true kleptomanic.

27:33.835 --> 27:37.599
I mean, Stephen, obviously, was much more ambitious.

27:37.619 --> 27:38.560
He had a focus.

27:38.708 --> 27:42.232
He really had a focus, and he also got out a lot more places.

27:42.252 --> 27:47.359
I mean, this became a tremendous... He had a scheme, I mean, in terms of plan.

27:47.379 --> 28:02.438
Yeah, there are some other people who, in all-time history, I guess with Reinberger, and I think Count Libre would be the case, a Frenchman in the French Academy in the 19th century,

28:02.975 --> 28:07.341
who stole huge quantities of fine libraries, chunks of them.

28:07.361 --> 28:07.661
L-I-B-R-I.

28:07.861 --> 28:09.924
L-I-B-R-I, yeah.

28:09.944 --> 28:12.007
And the Libri Affair is well written up.

28:12.027 --> 28:13.549
They're a lot of books and articles about Libri.

28:13.909 --> 28:17.554
So there are some notable cases.

28:18.856 --> 28:21.239
And there's some notable individuals.

28:21.279 --> 28:27.987
I mean, there were a couple of popes who were, the famous story about the stolen book falling out from one reason.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.551
And this quote, I mean, after a while, they wouldn't even let them go in the room.

28:30.631 --> 28:31.632
I mean, it's the pope.

28:32.084 --> 28:33.445
They want to be alone with the books.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.407
They want me still.

28:36.528 --> 28:38.350
I'm going to have that story.

28:38.370 --> 28:39.331
Yeah, that's a great story.

28:39.971 --> 28:48.840
But the set of, you know, I wouldn't put him into, you know, but of his type.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.522
And in America, I think that's true.

28:51.923 --> 28:56.347
As far as we know, nobody has stolen as many things from as many places.

28:57.488 --> 29:01.652
And with the added, the fact that there was such a focus,

29:02.088 --> 29:09.816
And also clearly somebody who was not doing it for money, as far as we can tell.

29:09.896 --> 29:10.496
Very clearly.

29:11.157 --> 29:11.998
No question about it.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.980
And there's where the completely different person.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.561
Shen wouldn't have cared about any of these things.

29:15.601 --> 29:17.903
I mean, it was purely things to be gotten rid of.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.185
His father told me.

29:19.245 --> 29:24.029
I mean, he gets a $72,000 annual trust.

29:24.650 --> 29:26.252
I had no idea it was so huge.

29:26.272 --> 29:27.393
$72,000 each year.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.095
And his father disperses it to him.

29:30.696 --> 29:31.757
And the guy lives.

29:32.142 --> 29:36.649
I mean, like a homeless, he goes, and when he needs clothes, he goes to a Goodwill thing.

29:36.669 --> 29:37.550
What's he doing with all the money?

29:38.251 --> 29:39.734
He gives it away or he spends it.

29:39.754 --> 29:40.255
God knows.

29:40.615 --> 29:42.198
I don't know what he does with it.

29:42.218 --> 29:43.880
He gives money away to homeless.

29:43.900 --> 29:44.181
He does.

29:44.321 --> 29:48.848
When he took me out on his drive that day, we first went to see some homeless people.

29:49.589 --> 29:51.652
You were nervous going into the airport?

29:52.994 --> 29:57.321
Because all they allege that he stole are the books.

29:57.341 --> 29:57.441
Yeah.

29:57.944 --> 30:02.670
There's nothing about... I mean, I got a call from a guy in Toronto who collects 78 RPM records.

30:02.710 --> 30:06.295
They interviewed me in the Toronto Globe and Mail last week.

30:06.315 --> 30:07.537
He says, he'd like to buy the records.

30:07.577 --> 30:10.661
I said, well, you know... He said, well, they're stolen.

30:10.701 --> 30:13.825
I said, no, they're his, and they remain his, and they're in his warehouse.

30:13.845 --> 30:14.646
Well, he's going to go up.

30:14.666 --> 30:18.531
I said, he's paid the lease on the warehouse probably for the next two or three years.

30:18.591 --> 30:20.634
This thing remains his.

30:20.674 --> 30:21.956
Fascinating.

30:21.976 --> 30:23.698
50,000 doorknobs.

30:24.619 --> 30:27.563
Well, I guess my thing about...

30:28.471 --> 30:30.493
It was interesting.

30:30.553 --> 30:40.482
Roger started, you know, discovered, seems to have almost discovered theft in this case, and was highly indignant that this creep should be allowed to walk.

30:40.502 --> 30:44.266
I mean, he should clearly be garroted.

30:45.167 --> 30:58.039
And I kept thinking, you know, Roger, would you say the same thing about all those Harvard graduates who have stolen Widener blind in the past few years?

30:59.015 --> 31:00.918
I mean, several of them have been arrested.

31:00.938 --> 31:01.659
He's told me about them.

31:01.779 --> 31:04.484
One they call the French thief, the other they call the English thief.

31:04.504 --> 31:05.686
Luther, Ross, yeah.

31:05.926 --> 31:08.250
And they've taken books, you know, in French.

31:08.551 --> 31:13.559
And either graduates, professors, or teaching assistants, or whatever.

31:13.599 --> 31:17.926
Well, I mean, let's get real about, you know, those kind of people.

31:17.946 --> 31:23.014
Instead of, Bloomberg is bad enough, but in most cases...

31:24.547 --> 31:27.651
I think the real danger is much closer at hand.

31:27.691 --> 31:30.014
Those are what I'm really concerned about.

31:30.274 --> 31:35.340
Bloomberg is, as I said on National Public Radio, when I first heard about him, a tragic, sort of a tragic figure.

31:35.360 --> 31:45.512
I mean, here's somebody who clearly... You don't have to be terribly knowledgeable about psychology to see if there's some real problems here.

31:45.532 --> 31:50.078
And it's a... You can't just see it in a vengeful way.

31:50.098 --> 31:52.140
He says, this is a person who's bad.

31:53.251 --> 32:00.219
It's the privileged people who steal, who know better, who don't have to do it.

32:00.299 --> 32:02.282
I'm much more concerned about it.

32:02.682 --> 32:07.468
To go back to an earlier quote, you said you have become a collector of book thefts.

32:07.488 --> 32:11.373
Yeah, and of stories of book theft, yeah.

32:11.493 --> 32:19.883
When I was admitted to the Golier Club, and one of the first things they asked you there, you know, what do you collect?

32:20.808 --> 32:26.295
And I was thinking of the things in which I've had a modest collecting interest over the years.

32:26.735 --> 32:31.421
And because I'm a librarian, I may collect and then dispose of the library and then collect something else.

32:31.881 --> 32:38.009
So my focuses have changed, particularly as I've moved from English history to other things in my career.

32:38.910 --> 32:48.942
But the thing that was most uppermost in my mind is that I collect books, and I've got

32:50.356 --> 32:54.261
The drawers are full of files of cases of book theft.

32:54.861 --> 32:59.087
People write me about what's happened and want to know if I've got any reaction to it.

32:59.127 --> 33:02.951
Sometimes I'm able to say, well, yes, that's very much like such and such a thing.

33:03.112 --> 33:06.195
Or, you know, have you gotten in touch with so and so?

33:06.215 --> 33:09.619
So I've become sort of a clearinghouse on book theft.

33:09.740 --> 33:10.681
What fascinates you?

33:10.721 --> 33:13.544
Is it the fact that they're stealing books or the motivation?

33:13.564 --> 33:19.992
I mean, is it what motivates these people to be bibliocleptomaniacs?

33:20.933 --> 33:31.250
I wish I could tell you that's true, but no, because it seems to me that Johnny Jenkins was right some years ago when he defined the different types of book thieves that there were.

33:31.270 --> 33:36.698
I think there are just a few basic types, and almost everybody seems to be a variation of that.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.525
And frankly, I haven't seen any new cases.

33:40.605 --> 33:42.508
Even Bloomberg is not new in a way.

33:42.528 --> 33:44.371
It's just going to be one of the best developed examples.

33:45.673 --> 33:48.257
The same thing is true of Shin.

33:49.182 --> 33:50.964
I don't expect to find new motivations.

33:51.104 --> 34:09.324
I see them as just different examples of the same garden varieties, but my interest has all along been in what can I know that will help me to help libraries reduce their vulnerability to theft.

34:09.724 --> 34:15.190
What is it that these incidences tell us about

34:16.317 --> 34:20.601
What a library is not doing right, or what can it overcome?

34:21.081 --> 34:23.724
And in many cases, there are poor procedures.

34:24.204 --> 34:34.474
Libraries in the past quite often didn't take precautions about taking books that were very valuable, little use, and put them in special collections.

34:34.534 --> 34:38.417
Things had appreciated in value over a period of time, and they hadn't bothered to call these.

34:39.779 --> 34:45.784
Some people simply didn't see the value of strong ID practices.

34:46.304 --> 34:52.471
where it's pretty clear from the evidence that they lost control of the contents of their stacks.

34:52.491 --> 35:04.745
This is true at Harvard, where it's very difficult to keep people from going in because people manage to flash different credentials and then get into the stacks and then steal things.

35:04.785 --> 35:15.957
In fact, what we propose at Harvard they do is to institute a fairly fundamental ID policy so that people have to show that they are who they are in order to gain access to the stacks.

35:16.510 --> 35:18.913
and not simply have the door, you know, thing open like a sieve.

35:19.293 --> 35:21.356
That's right.

35:22.137 --> 35:34.211
So what I have, what my interest, I think, has been as a professional librarian learning from these accounts in order to simply do a better job as a librarian.

35:34.231 --> 35:40.358
So I'm afraid it's a very prosaic interest, and it's not compulsive or exciting or sexy.

35:40.895 --> 35:46.904
Does any of the Arcania interest you, like people who were killed for books or have been killed for books?

35:46.984 --> 35:53.994
You know, that case that Rosenbach discusses in Books and Bitters, was it the Spanish fellow that killed many people?

35:54.034 --> 35:55.716
Well, it doesn't seem to be terribly common.

35:55.956 --> 35:57.539
It's only happened that once.

35:57.739 --> 36:07.313
It's an aberration, and therefore it's sort of hard to get interested in that facet because you don't see too many examples of it.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.497
If we had a rash of those, I think we might get interested.

36:11.827 --> 36:29.833
I've tried to, I mean, all of my interest reflects practical questions of a person in charge of major repository books, such as what is the nature of your vulnerability?

36:29.893 --> 36:35.061
Are you more vulnerable to a certain type of person?

36:35.281 --> 36:37.004
Are you more vulnerable to the visitor?

36:37.204 --> 36:38.586
Is that what you have to worry about?

36:39.988 --> 36:40.669
My studies have

36:40.970 --> 36:50.084
They may believe you have to be more concerned about your own staff because you're much more vulnerable within your own staff in a rare books library.

36:51.206 --> 36:58.597
We may not have very many actual thefts, but I mean, we're clearly much more vulnerable from inside than we are to people from the outside.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.819
Just one is a major loss.

36:59.979 --> 37:01.221
Glover couldn't even get in the door.

37:01.241 --> 37:03.064
I mean, he tried to get in, couldn't get in.

37:03.504 --> 37:04.386
He didn't hit here.

37:04.446 --> 37:05.287
He couldn't get in.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.228
He didn't get an AAS.

37:06.249 --> 37:06.589
Couldn't get in.

37:06.856 --> 37:10.040
And Harvard, of course, he's right, but he'd never get in the Houghton.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.543
You know, I mean, he... Oh, no, he wouldn't.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.085
There's no way I could get in the Houghton.

37:14.105 --> 37:14.766
That's what I'm saying.

37:14.786 --> 37:21.315
I mean... But I think it's fascinating he could get into Widener Stacks, which is loaded with stuff anyway.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.397
Darkness he could get into.

37:23.738 --> 37:26.622
You know, it's amazing that you could get into Harvard Stacks.

37:26.642 --> 37:33.491
When I was a young instructor teaching in Boston, I couldn't get into Harvard Stacks because it wasn't even open to undergraduates.

37:33.511 --> 37:34.852
They've opened it up, and now they can't.

37:35.033 --> 37:36.154
Now it's, you know, like a sieve.

37:36.877 --> 37:49.568
But it's the practical lessons that I learned from it that I find interesting.

37:49.648 --> 37:56.635
Were you, just a little biographical background, where you formed a lot of the library?

37:58.136 --> 38:05.803
I was born a North Carolinian and went to, as it turned out, to college and graduate school at Duke.

38:06.543 --> 38:12.490
All I went to Davidson to Duke as a graduate student, and I've always been a library-based person.

38:12.710 --> 38:21.121
I basically got a PhD in history and taught at college, university for years before I made a transition to the library.

38:21.721 --> 38:29.230
In my line of work, in teaching, you'd use the library so much and use it with your classes so much that the interaction was so great.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.634
I was constantly interfering with librarians telling them how to run their business.

38:32.654 --> 38:36.499
They'd say, if you think you'd use this one, you ought to run one yourself.

38:36.968 --> 38:38.810
You know, I made that transition.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.691
I was in Boston teaching at UMass Boston.

38:41.472 --> 38:48.539
In my spare time, I got a library degree and decided to make the switch to a full-time librarianship.

38:48.859 --> 38:51.401
We had built a library from scratch at UMass Boston.

38:56.086 --> 38:57.447
Did you know Victor Burch at all?

38:57.747 --> 38:57.947
No.

38:58.188 --> 38:59.068
Over at Brandeis?

38:59.089 --> 38:59.269
No.

38:59.789 --> 39:01.130
Interesting guy.

39:01.150 --> 39:02.091
When you finish, I'll give you that.

39:02.111 --> 39:06.115
Well, Walter Grossman, who had been an hour and came up and built the UMass library, and I was

39:06.483 --> 39:07.304
a colleague of his.

39:08.165 --> 39:10.988
So I became fascinated, and so I made that transition.

39:11.008 --> 39:17.815
My first job in the library, early 1970s, my first job in the library, a paying job at least, was as a director.

39:17.955 --> 39:20.878
I didn't work my way from the ranks.

39:21.639 --> 39:23.081
And from, you know?

39:23.101 --> 39:27.946
From there to SUNY, the College of Potsdam, and from there to Torblin.

39:28.126 --> 39:29.187
And how long did you have been here?

39:30.008 --> 39:30.909
It was about 11 years.

39:32.070 --> 39:36.355
And you came here in last year?

39:36.773 --> 39:46.301
And, of course, it's great because I'm back now in where my doctorate and my master's in British history really is centered.

39:46.341 --> 39:57.671
As a matter of fact, these pictures, this is one of my collections, these are Gilways, reflect a bunch of politicians whose papers happen to be here.

39:58.812 --> 40:06.038
And just a lot of the things that I worked with when I was a graduate student, in fact, are based here.

40:06.558 --> 40:32.582
marvelous uh library for english history it's a dream job isn't it well sometimes it's a nightmare i mean it it's been allowed to slide for a long time and uh and there's just a lot to do to turn it around and it's not and everything costs money and in what aspect you mean in just administration or acquisitions now acquisitions are kind of quiet aren't they everything you can think about there's no money staff is not paid

40:33.288 --> 40:34.349
Which is hard to understand.

40:34.369 --> 40:35.270
Now, why is that?

40:35.330 --> 40:42.899
I mean, Mr. Huntington didn't look... Well, he could look 30 or 40 years down the road, but he couldn't look 75.

40:43.961 --> 40:50.729
Trustees didn't continue to see the importance of building up the endowment, but they just sort of thought it would be okay.

40:51.089 --> 40:55.434
The place was so well-heeled that outsiders think, why would I give money to the Huntington?

40:55.454 --> 40:56.275
It obviously hasn't.

40:56.525 --> 40:59.169
The Getty's going to have the same problem unless they can... You think so?

40:59.269 --> 40:59.810
Oh, sure.

40:59.830 --> 41:04.517
I mean, Mel told us last year they've got to list several billion dollars.

41:04.537 --> 41:17.476
Mel also will tell you that they don't have all the money they need and that they're right away, they're developing a development office so that they can not just spend, but in fact raise money for certain... They are kind of the main event right now in terms of who's buying them, aren't they?

41:17.496 --> 41:18.978
Well, in that field, yeah.

41:18.998 --> 41:22.283
In that field, particularly in art, yeah.

41:22.323 --> 41:25.027
But only illuminated manuscripts or artist manuscripts.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.329
They've got a very tight focus.

41:26.849 --> 41:28.191
which is smart.

41:30.413 --> 41:38.783
Well, but I will tell you that they're going to make sure, some of their trustees are our trustees, and they're going to make sure the same thing doesn't happen to them.

41:39.183 --> 41:51.398
Basically, the endowment won't pay all the operating expenses, and they've not built it up fast enough, and the cost of simply doing business run far ahead of the revenues.

41:52.339 --> 41:55.202
And meanwhile, the library is sort of now

41:55.655 --> 41:56.837
slow to a walk.

41:56.877 --> 41:59.280
We don't buy it as much as we like.

41:59.340 --> 42:02.125
If we bought, we don't have a building to put it into because the building is full.

42:02.145 --> 42:05.029
The addition has been deferred and deferred and deferred.

42:05.049 --> 42:13.842
The places are beginning to look a little tatty and dingy and old-fashioned, so it's not as apt to attract younger people.

42:14.623 --> 42:19.009
There's not enough room to bring readers from the outside, so it tends to be rather stuffy.

42:20.472 --> 42:21.353
There's no automation.

42:22.314 --> 42:24.177
The collection is rich as it is.

42:24.899 --> 42:53.792
much of it is uh is fully catalogued because the early cataloging was all done as a rare books collection not for not for scholars and so you don't have nearly the kind of detailed catalog uh and you can't convert it to an online catalog because there's there's no data to search i didn't even notice that so but you're not computerized no we're just just beginning and so there's loads of things to do so to build up the staff build up uh

42:53.992 --> 42:59.118
You've got to fill up its salaries if you're going to get a better stamp, if you're going to fill in the blanks.

42:59.138 --> 43:01.861
I mean, if Alan Judsy would leave, Alan's terribly unabated.

43:01.881 --> 43:03.803
He's a brilliant guy.

43:04.604 --> 43:07.107
And if he would leave, I don't know how we'd replace him.

43:07.127 --> 43:09.350
We certainly couldn't replace him at his salary.

43:09.730 --> 43:12.093
A lot of people stay out of tremendous loyalty to that place.

43:12.113 --> 43:22.885
No, but I mean, the point is, people, I don't want to use anything as it would be a tremendous place, but just in answer to your question, I mean, for me, in...

43:23.067 --> 43:35.119
in college, university, my job was to get money politically out of provosts and presidents and, you know, develop leverage and so forth and outmaneuver people and I was very successful.

43:35.159 --> 43:37.241
Here there's no alumni, no faculty.

43:38.002 --> 43:43.507
Speak to me for a second because that is almost a unique American institution, the research library.

43:43.747 --> 43:44.548
That's right.

43:44.568 --> 43:45.689
Founded by collectors.

43:45.970 --> 43:46.750
Huntington, this.

43:47.631 --> 43:50.374
Morgan, this, the Folger, the AAS.

43:50.675 --> 43:51.416
Newbury.

43:51.436 --> 43:51.937
Newbury.

43:51.957 --> 43:53.719
There are a lot of them like this.

43:54.019 --> 43:56.042
The Clark, yeah.

43:56.162 --> 43:56.442
J.C.

43:56.462 --> 43:57.323
Brown, in a way.

43:59.366 --> 44:06.835
If they're to be really useful in the world of research and scholarship, they have to keep pace.

44:07.936 --> 44:17.187
And unfortunately, the people they serve, the users, the academics, are not the people who support them.

44:17.207 --> 44:20.091
So I have to go out and raise money from a dowager in San Marino.

44:20.678 --> 44:29.447
in order to make it possible to buy books for this, you know, graduate student out here who doesn't know this person and doesn't care.

44:29.748 --> 44:33.712
And it's a much trickier business.

44:33.772 --> 44:35.534
And you don't have an alumni either.

44:35.554 --> 44:35.894
That's right.

44:35.914 --> 44:38.857
So for me, instead of outmaneuving somebody, I've got to go out and raise money.

44:39.237 --> 44:44.103
And fortunately, there are some people around who are loyal and have resources, and that's very good.

44:44.123 --> 44:49.268
I mean, people sit down and say how much you need, and you say, well, I need

44:50.935 --> 44:53.557
$125,000, so let's make it $250,000.

44:53.577 --> 45:00.603
And you're like, well, okay, why didn't I ask for $250,000 to start there?

45:01.324 --> 45:01.464
Fine.

45:02.065 --> 45:06.649
But, I mean, there are people who have been there, but a lot of that has to happen.

45:06.889 --> 45:19.460
And so one of the big problems is to keep things going and developing it upward at the same time and hope that we can get the resources to really make the place as good in its performance as it is in this collection.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.841
Its collections are fabulous.

45:21.091 --> 45:23.294
It really doesn't have to add when you think about it.

45:23.815 --> 45:39.699
I mean, you get targets of opportunities, certainly, but... You have to, if you just became frozen in amber, I mean, a lot of the collections that are so rich and support all those people who were there in that special reading room were acquired in the past 15, 20, 25 years.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.482
Now, some of them are, in fact, old.

45:41.502 --> 45:42.283
Some of them go back.

45:42.784 --> 45:45.909
And it's amazing how much vitality there is in some of those rich collections.

45:45.929 --> 45:48.413
But you have to keep going, and you also have to keep relevant.

45:48.893 --> 45:50.035
If the only thing that you...

45:50.487 --> 46:00.019
You had where British and American documents before, say, 1914, 1860, after a while you'd become less and less relevant.

46:00.460 --> 46:04.024
So we have to continue to develop in the field of history of science.

46:05.145 --> 46:10.112
We have all the papers of Hubble and so forth, history of astrophysics, early astrophysics.

46:10.132 --> 46:18.402
We're the premier place in the country for the frontier, for the American West,

46:19.141 --> 46:22.204
for the history of California, for the history of Los Angeles, all those kinds of things.

46:22.224 --> 46:27.851
We have to continue to develop and have materials that people are really going to find useful.

46:28.571 --> 46:29.973
So, yeah, you have to continue to grow.

46:29.993 --> 46:32.896
If you don't grow, you really are dead, in every respect.

46:33.056 --> 46:38.362
And all you have to do is just run projections out, you know, far enough in the future, and you can just simply see it coming less and less relevant.

46:38.482 --> 46:48.473
Unfortunately, we are so unique, and we're in the, you know, in one of the great expanding, developing parts of, well, nobody will duplicate what we do.

46:49.010 --> 46:51.052
Nobody will ever again build a Huntington Library.

46:53.095 --> 46:59.402
So we've got something to build on, clearly, and something to develop, and something to preserve and enhance.

47:00.163 --> 47:01.465
We don't have to start from scratch.

47:02.186 --> 47:03.447
But we do have to do something.

47:03.467 --> 47:04.409
We have to rejuvenate.

47:04.449 --> 47:10.035
If you don't grow, if you don't renew, you really do atrophy.

47:10.456 --> 47:14.461
And that can happen to anybody.

47:14.481 --> 47:18.966
I mean, say, though we will ever again build a Huntington Library, you mean anything beautiful?

47:19.857 --> 47:33.660
Obviously not what you have, but you think the great independent research library that is built on the collection of an individual is pretty much over?

47:33.720 --> 47:36.464
Yeah, I do, and that's a considered opinion.

47:37.406 --> 47:42.134
There are still people who will build up great collections out of eccentricity or need or whatever else.

47:42.715 --> 47:46.000
Most of the great collections will have come from that way.

47:46.520 --> 47:56.257
either from their obsession or from the need to collect information, will have a nice, sizable collection of 10,000, maybe 15,000, 20,000 volumes.

47:56.277 --> 48:01.466
But nobody's going to have the huge collections of rare books or they don't exist.

48:02.207 --> 48:03.549
Nobody's got them that we know of now.

48:03.830 --> 48:10.281
Huntington-Brock Hole Libraries, Church Collection, Ellesmere, Bridgewater Collection, all those other things.

48:10.301 --> 48:11.042
The Stowe Papers,

48:11.697 --> 48:17.145
Nobody that we know of has that kind of money anymore.

48:17.546 --> 48:21.091
You not only have to, and the expectations of a library are great.

48:21.471 --> 48:23.434
You don't just buy it and display it.

48:23.454 --> 48:24.536
You're going to have to house it.

48:24.556 --> 48:27.661
You're going to have to make it available to scholars.

48:27.781 --> 48:28.702
You have to protect it.

48:28.742 --> 48:29.824
You have to preserve it.

48:29.844 --> 48:31.907
You have to have environmental controls.

48:32.448 --> 48:33.309
You've got to publish.

48:33.429 --> 48:34.110
You've got to do all this.

48:34.130 --> 48:40.860
Well, the chances are that rather than start from scratch, and there's a guy, there are a few guys who are attempting to do that right now, by the way,

48:41.212 --> 48:42.633
So it couldn't let you do?

48:43.154 --> 48:43.414
Yeah.

48:43.694 --> 48:46.517
There's a guy in Santa Barbara.

48:46.537 --> 48:47.278
Dave Karpels.

48:47.658 --> 48:49.100
We interviewed him last year.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.942
I just wanted to see if that's who you were going to name him.

48:51.962 --> 48:53.023
Karpels is the case.

48:53.264 --> 48:53.844
He's doomed.

48:54.345 --> 48:58.088
There's absolutely no way that will survive because he doesn't have the money to make it survive.

48:58.108 --> 48:59.550
He claims, what did he say?

48:59.630 --> 49:00.410
He's got it all figured.

49:00.931 --> 49:01.672
Mathematician.

49:01.692 --> 49:04.574
He figures in 100 years he's going to have more money than the Getty.

49:05.415 --> 49:10.560
But he's wrong because he's not going to be around 100 years to supervise it and it's not going to happen.

49:11.418 --> 49:13.841
And I think it's very unlikely that they'll happen.

49:13.861 --> 49:18.966
What will happen is that these collections will become major wings or parts of the collection.

49:18.986 --> 49:19.967
Who has one million manuscripts?

49:20.007 --> 49:22.009
What will become of those one million manuscripts?

49:22.550 --> 49:22.950
I don't know.

49:23.130 --> 49:35.504
And depending on how he... I hope they're treated well in the meantime because in some places there's going to be a lawsuit, there's going to be a family fight, there's going to be a will challenged, a trust broken.

49:35.524 --> 49:35.984
Who knows?

49:36.104 --> 49:37.125
There'll be something awful.

49:37.466 --> 49:39.568
You know the similar case of the

49:40.072 --> 49:44.739
the art collector, I can't remember his name in Philadelphia, who put together that fabulous collection.

49:44.759 --> 49:45.601
Blessing Rosenwald?

49:45.981 --> 49:46.182
No.

49:47.844 --> 49:53.232
I forget which one it's called, and it was open maybe, by appointment only occasionally, and he had it.

49:53.853 --> 49:56.978
He had a fabulous collection of old masters and so forth.

49:57.960 --> 50:01.465
And then he laid down these very eccentric rules.

50:02.106 --> 50:06.433
He died, and I was sort of a trust.

50:07.021 --> 50:08.964
They can't operate because there's no income.

50:09.304 --> 50:11.127
And the only good income is to open it up.

50:11.167 --> 50:13.370
If you open it up, there are other costs.

50:15.794 --> 50:21.643
What they want to do is even sell off a few things in order to build up an endowment so they will pay for the operation.

50:21.663 --> 50:23.205
According to the trust, you can't do that.

50:24.106 --> 50:35.183
And so, basically, they'll have to close the thing and just keep it there until somebody, unless they can move it under the aegis of some university or some museum or something.

50:35.683 --> 50:36.825
But that is just not going to happen.

50:37.514 --> 50:38.676
It's just not going to go.

50:38.816 --> 50:41.139
These things may go temporary, but they're not going to be able to survive.

50:41.620 --> 50:44.524
Look at Armand Hammer's art museum.

50:45.425 --> 50:46.426
It's not going to last.

50:46.486 --> 50:47.007
It's a joke.

50:48.469 --> 50:51.093
Well, who's the guy that just gave everything to the Met now?

50:51.193 --> 50:54.177
Walt Annenberg, who is just over the mountains.

50:54.998 --> 50:58.162
You've got Norton Simon, who has a museum here, but he won't stay here.

50:58.182 --> 50:58.823
He'll sell it.

50:59.224 --> 51:06.053
It'll either go to some museum, or it'll become part of somebody's estate, and they'll auction it off.

51:06.809 --> 51:35.213
books I don't I don't think it's likely that it just doesn't seem like that you would have anybody who could have a big enough collection that they could not only create over you know something worthy of research and something really rich they have to buy several libraries like you couldn't just do it and

51:35.733 --> 51:39.476
then to run it as an institution, I think it has to be under somebody's umbrella.

51:39.496 --> 51:44.841
And so I think they'll go to, they'll either be dispersed or they'll have to go to all institutions.

51:45.462 --> 51:55.591
Or something like a Clements Library or, you know, or Scheide's Library, which is tight, 5,000 items, that's on Princeton, and presumably it will go on Princeton.

51:55.611 --> 51:55.912
Oh, sure.

51:55.972 --> 52:01.417
I don't know, because they're the ones who can provide the kind of context for it and the administrative costs and so forth.

52:01.437 --> 52:03.799
So, no, I don't expect to see it happen.

52:04.235 --> 52:07.739
But we certainly do owe a debt to the collectors, don't we?

52:07.759 --> 52:08.379
Oh, I think so.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.643
I think we do.

52:11.823 --> 52:22.895
I mean, that's one of my occasional speech topics is the relationship between collectors and scholarship.

52:23.335 --> 52:30.823
And the fact that, in many cases, the collectors may be sort of superficial as scholars.

52:30.883 --> 52:32.925
I mean, they really are obsessed with maybe just

52:33.445 --> 52:34.746
getting all of a certain thing.

52:35.527 --> 52:41.654
But ultimately, the act of their collecting brings together the nucleus of a research collection.

52:42.215 --> 52:43.997
And so scholars ultimately benefit.

52:44.637 --> 52:52.787
I guess I wrote a little booklet, or an empty little booklet, which I should send you, which has a couple of essays along that line.

52:52.807 --> 52:53.247
That would be nice.

52:53.347 --> 52:54.388
That would be really nice.

52:54.809 --> 52:57.412
That's kind of one of the major themes of the book.

52:57.452 --> 52:58.633
It's called Speaking of Books.

52:58.993 --> 53:02.237
And it's just a

53:02.673 --> 53:30.857
if you don't think of it i'll remind of it i'll try to get you a copy i'm sure i'll just simply have you have your all your cards with me and i'll ask my secretary overland just to make sure you send a copy of that i don't think i have any here because i've got to get this you've given us so wonderful is there anything that uh

53:31.428 --> 53:43.821
I feel as funny that... Well, don't hesitate to ever... I don't think I can be very helpful except for somebody to bounce ideas off of, but particularly for this topic.

53:43.841 --> 53:45.365
But I'm delighted that you're doing this.

53:45.445 --> 53:46.568
I mean, I think there are a lot of people who've
