WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:05.263
Okay, with you, we're on the record.

00:05.283 --> 00:07.445
You don't mind talking into it.

00:08.647 --> 00:11.750
You're the third Nobel laureate I've interviewed in the last year.

00:11.790 --> 00:18.757
Nadine Gordimer here at Harvard, and Ken Zuboura away a few months ago, and yourself.

00:18.817 --> 00:24.222
And I don't say this to gloat about my access to wonderful art.

00:24.783 --> 00:28.907
But the point is, the reason I bring this up,

00:29.258 --> 00:38.029
that each of them, each of these people, has expressed a sense of what the Nobel means, I mean, the responsibility and the obligations.

00:38.729 --> 00:45.397
Do you feel any kind of sense that you're carrying some kind of baggage because of this?

00:45.417 --> 00:47.820
No, simply there are more pressures than before, that's all.

00:48.201 --> 00:48.801
I'm sorry, what?

00:48.821 --> 00:50.824
There are more pressures than before.

00:51.585 --> 00:51.905
I understand.

00:51.925 --> 00:52.906
Obligations?

00:52.926 --> 00:53.507
No.

00:53.527 --> 00:57.612
Whatever I wanted to do before, I try to do now.

00:57.963 --> 01:00.085
I teach, I write, I don't change my life.

01:01.266 --> 01:05.371
The only thing is there are more invitations and more pressures.

01:05.951 --> 01:08.994
That's almost the negative part of it.

01:09.014 --> 01:11.717
The good part is that if you want to make a statement, then you can.

01:12.318 --> 01:15.161
I'm thinking specifically of the Wittberg, of course.

01:15.221 --> 01:16.422
Wittberg, that was before the Nobel.

01:16.823 --> 01:17.824
That was before the Nobel?

01:17.844 --> 01:19.986
Yeah, before the Nobel.

01:20.006 --> 01:20.947
Really, okay.

01:20.967 --> 01:22.649
A year before, a year and a half before.

01:22.669 --> 01:24.210
And it was very close, right there.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.311
A year and a half before.

01:25.331 --> 01:26.873
It was April 85.

01:28.051 --> 01:31.095
Nobel was told when he learned it is serious.

01:33.838 --> 01:46.715
Yes, but still, if a Nobel laureate takes himself too seriously because of Nobel, then he's in trouble.

01:47.115 --> 01:52.522
But it certainly does allow you to be heard, I think, in a much... Sure.

01:52.542 --> 01:54.565
If you make a statement, the microphones are here.

01:55.996 --> 02:07.613
You say very early on in the memoir, and I'm interested in why you chose to do a memoir as opposed to an autobiography, and I wonder if there's a difference in your view.

02:07.633 --> 02:17.046
Yes, autobiography is much more horizontal, which means linear, and the idea is events.

02:17.066 --> 02:20.851
You give the events, 1928, and so forth and so forth.

02:22.013 --> 02:24.737
Memoirs, I think, reaches a greater depth.

02:26.168 --> 02:30.454
You go deeper in you in order to find the words for the memoir.

02:30.594 --> 02:37.983
Autobiography, it's like today you have so many autobiographies written here in America, the ghostwriters, and the whole thing is silly.

02:38.003 --> 02:42.589
How can a ghostwriter write an autobiography of somebody else?

02:42.609 --> 02:43.731
But he wouldn't write a memoir.

02:44.051 --> 02:48.657
And you also said very early, this is not the story of my life, but stories.

02:48.957 --> 02:49.258
That's right.

02:49.278 --> 02:52.282
And I wonder if you could explain what you mean by that.

02:52.362 --> 02:53.083
Precisely.

02:53.203 --> 02:55.686
The memoir, these stories, autobiographies,

02:56.155 --> 03:05.624
But I wonder if it also bears on your sense of storytelling.

03:05.744 --> 03:10.629
I want to get into your sense of the power of fiction, too, in the novel.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.871
I love storytelling.

03:13.131 --> 03:13.792
I love stories.

03:13.812 --> 03:20.879
I grew up in stories as a Hasid, as a student, always as a grandfather.

03:20.899 --> 03:21.920
I love stories.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.222
I think that the culture today,

03:25.703 --> 03:28.006
It should be a culture of telling tales.

03:29.768 --> 03:35.756
Otherwise, we go to dry areas, to dry silence.

03:37.058 --> 03:40.842
And storytelling is different.

03:40.903 --> 03:42.304
It brings back ancient, ancient.

03:42.444 --> 03:45.048
But it also gives you more freedom, doesn't it?

03:45.108 --> 03:52.217
I remember when I did an interview with Ilya Kazan on the occasion of his autobiography, and he said, when you write about yourself,

03:52.822 --> 03:55.985
You lay yourself naked before the world.

03:56.365 --> 03:59.488
You do that, you expose yourself.

04:01.190 --> 04:04.974
And are you fearful about, not fearful, but apprehensive, I guess, is a better word.

04:04.994 --> 04:05.894
No, I forget my age.

04:07.196 --> 04:07.576
My age.

04:08.337 --> 04:10.199
I've written almost 40 books.

04:10.859 --> 04:17.445
This is who I am.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.128
I don't do that, but this is who I am.

04:20.665 --> 04:30.353
I read in one of your interviews that you indicated that had you been rejected on your first effort, you might never have been a writer.

04:30.373 --> 04:31.054
Is that true?

04:31.074 --> 04:33.356
Yes, I'm a publisher.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.059
I cannot take rejections.

04:37.079 --> 04:37.600
Even today?

04:37.840 --> 04:38.761
Even today.

04:38.781 --> 04:40.442
I cannot.

04:40.462 --> 04:41.163
That's why I don't ask.

04:42.144 --> 04:43.144
I don't ask for favors.

04:43.204 --> 04:45.026
I don't ask.

04:45.046 --> 04:46.267
I cannot take rejections.

04:46.287 --> 04:49.710
And therefore, if I had failed totally, I would have probably...

04:50.281 --> 04:52.043
It's written a lot, not a drawer.

04:54.064 --> 05:04.534
I just, having read a number of your books, I just feel that you don't feel that you were a born writer, for quotation marks around that.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.217
I mean, if your purpose... I don't know what it means, a born writer.

05:07.257 --> 05:09.439
I wrote when I had to read it when I was a child.

05:09.599 --> 05:17.386
I wrote a commentary on the Bible, a full commentary, which I found when I came back once, 20 years later.

05:17.406 --> 05:18.047
It's holiday.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.528
I'm embarrassed to speak a lot.

05:20.386 --> 05:26.252
But my vocation was to write down my ideas.

05:26.292 --> 05:33.640
When you're writing fiction, is your goal to tell stories or to probe the deeper truths?

05:33.680 --> 05:34.501
The deeper truths.

05:35.302 --> 05:41.428
Even when I tell tales, the goal of the tales is to find a deeper area.

05:42.489 --> 05:50.157
And where you have, where events have forced themselves upon you, where you have become a witness

05:50.592 --> 05:56.457
and given testimony, you find that you can do this effectively through the novel.

05:56.597 --> 05:58.479
I don't know if you can explain that.

05:58.499 --> 06:05.285
There are certain topics that can be approached only... I'll check myself.

06:06.105 --> 06:11.870
Certain topics can be approached only in the form of novel.

06:11.890 --> 06:16.374
Others only as essays or as plays.

06:16.394 --> 06:19.857
For instance, my play Zalman couldn't

06:20.495 --> 06:21.616
anything but a play.

06:22.478 --> 06:27.023
The Forgotten, the Davis novel, couldn't be anything but a novel.

06:27.043 --> 06:31.749
So, and I feel comfortable in that mode.

06:31.769 --> 06:36.015
But where you have written, as you say, close to 40 books now?

06:37.336 --> 06:39.960
And do you see it all as one, as a corpus?

06:39.980 --> 06:40.941
Oh, yes, absolutely.

06:40.961 --> 06:42.343
And all are various?

06:42.463 --> 06:42.743
Absolutely.

06:42.763 --> 06:47.289
These 40 include a few books of conversations that, you know, people have with me.

06:48.010 --> 06:49.692
And even then, somehow they fit.

06:51.376 --> 06:59.166
going back to Nadine Gordimer, she indicated that I asked her a similar question.

06:59.186 --> 07:06.014
And she said, you know, she gave me the metaphor of going into a gallery and seeing a piece of sculpture.

07:06.615 --> 07:16.908
And she felt that her job as a writer was to kind of look at the, every book was a different view of, and suggesting that maybe there's one big story here.

07:17.408 --> 07:19.871
And that every book, every work has a different aspect to it.

07:19.991 --> 07:20.472
And I wonder if you

07:20.806 --> 07:36.432
I feel the same way, but I do actually the same, almost like all the same characters of most of them, the same books, except in one novel, one character is a spotlight, the other one, somebody else, one idea, other idea, but it's all one universe.

07:37.654 --> 07:42.082
And of course, we talk about, we talk about truth, it's with the capital T, of course.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.868
But you never name it, you know, it sounds bombastic, you know.

07:46.169 --> 07:48.071
You don't mind my jumping around a little bit?

07:48.431 --> 07:48.972
Go ahead.

07:48.992 --> 07:50.553
We'll make order it all.

07:50.653 --> 07:51.013
I know.

07:51.534 --> 07:52.835
Okay.

07:54.096 --> 08:03.905
Early on in the book, you said your pursuit of nocturnal trains ever since the lighting of the night.

08:03.925 --> 08:06.968
I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that, what you mean by that?

08:07.108 --> 08:16.176
Because I remember when you were on the trains crisscrossing and going through Europe from my little town to Auschwitz.

08:17.894 --> 08:24.923
trains, with sealed cars, cattle cars, you see, cattle cars, with little openings in the doors.

08:26.064 --> 08:29.248
That has been an obsession for me.

08:29.268 --> 08:31.311
But you said ever since then, also?

08:31.591 --> 08:31.952
Ever since.

08:31.972 --> 08:33.714
Ever since then.

08:33.794 --> 08:34.315
Wondering?

08:34.355 --> 08:38.120
The whole world knew where they were going.

08:38.620 --> 08:39.722
So this is a metaphor.

08:40.042 --> 08:40.963
This is a metaphor.

08:40.983 --> 08:42.645
It's a metaphor, but also real.

08:42.926 --> 08:46.450
But, you know, you say also that very same page.

08:47.088 --> 08:51.032
that you say the world didn't care whether Jews lived or died.

08:51.052 --> 08:54.355
That's quite a strong indictment against the free world.

08:54.675 --> 08:55.436
But it is true.

08:56.297 --> 09:00.821
Look, the free world then was engaged in a glorious, noble war.

09:02.103 --> 09:07.468
Roosevelt and Churchill were involved in something very beautiful to fight Hitler.

09:08.069 --> 09:14.715
They mobilized tens of millions of people, sending them to the front to battle to fight Hitler.

09:15.539 --> 09:21.087
But the parallel war, the war against Jews, was ignored.

09:21.107 --> 09:24.492
And you say, also, you have asked, why didn't you bomb the tracks?

09:25.693 --> 09:28.157
Have you never been given a satisfactory answer?

09:28.177 --> 09:28.377
Never.

09:28.517 --> 09:32.403
I asked everybody, the British and the American, Russian generals.

09:32.523 --> 09:34.286
I asked them now.

09:34.306 --> 09:36.729
But this is, to me, a very important question.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.293
Because Hungarian Jews could have been saved.

09:40.835 --> 09:41.396
They were the last.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.500
They were the last transport

09:44.783 --> 09:52.352
The first transport of these Jews went out the second part of May, almost before D-Day.

09:54.154 --> 09:59.099
And look, they couldn't be saved.

09:59.119 --> 10:04.886
800,000, 600,000, 600,000 people in six weeks were gas.

10:04.906 --> 10:06.608
And you think they knew very early on.

10:08.630 --> 10:12.394
There's a wonderful book, Why Did the Sky Is Not Darken?

10:12.712 --> 10:16.316
And there is a book, one of the earliest, called Arthur Morse.

10:17.697 --> 10:25.525
A lot of people called it, Why Six Million Jews Die.

10:25.545 --> 10:25.705
Amazing.

10:25.725 --> 10:25.825
Yeah.

10:25.845 --> 10:41.841
Do you have, I wonder if this book, if it's just coincidental, but as we approach the end of the century and the millennium, do you have any, and you also say that a memoir is kind of a balance sheet.

10:42.496 --> 10:49.083
Look, this century will not remain in history as all the best.

10:49.424 --> 10:56.271
We had two totalitarian movements that ceased out and caused the death of how many, 60 million kids?

10:56.291 --> 11:02.998
I think a number, as they say, is 60 million kids.

11:03.199 --> 11:10.967
Then we had the cursed progress of handling death.

11:11.723 --> 11:14.746
Never before had there been factories producing death.

11:16.807 --> 11:19.490
Efficiently and systematically?

11:19.510 --> 11:23.693
And efficiently, cold-bloodedly, like producing matches.

11:23.733 --> 11:26.075
Sausages or whatever.

11:26.095 --> 11:31.960
Then you had, for the first time, a human being reduced to numbers, to objects.

11:31.980 --> 11:36.784
Even the worst part would kill this human being, savagely, Genghis Khan.

11:37.885 --> 11:40.988
But for the first time, it is a human being,

11:41.474 --> 11:52.005
So you described that scene that you learned many years later about your uncle Mendel, I guess, and his son.

11:52.025 --> 11:54.107
So the balance sheet is not very, very good.

11:54.127 --> 12:02.595
At the same time, at the end now, well, the book ends in 69, but today I try to find some hope for my students after all.

12:02.615 --> 12:10.283
Some good things happened now, the fall of communism, the end of apartheid.

12:11.697 --> 12:18.590
also the breakup of these communist lands.

12:18.610 --> 12:21.195
Good things, and peace between Israel and America.

12:21.215 --> 12:22.357
Things are happening.

12:23.680 --> 12:30.392
You choose for your title, of course, a fragment from Ecclesiastes, which you also use in the epigraph.

12:30.472 --> 12:34.600
And I think you've been quoted as saying, Ecclesiastes is generally

12:35.153 --> 12:36.614
the most pessimistic.

12:37.395 --> 12:40.198
I wonder if you could explain, is there a paradox here?

12:40.218 --> 12:42.800
Of course, even that is a paradox.

12:42.820 --> 12:50.667
But I love the Ecclesiastes, the Afrolists there are very, very depressing and beautiful.

12:50.687 --> 12:54.070
And I took it because of this.

12:54.090 --> 13:00.256
But I want to say this, in general, the best titles are in the Bible.

13:00.376 --> 13:01.797
Oh, really?

13:01.817 --> 13:04.840
When writers or editors or publishers need a good title, they should

13:05.157 --> 13:08.041
Or Shakespeare is a good, strong section.

13:08.061 --> 13:10.725
Shakespeare's not a bad section.

13:10.745 --> 13:18.496
And so the fact here is that, except I want to say, all the rivers flowing down into the sea.

13:18.516 --> 13:20.839
The second part is, and the sea is not full.

13:20.859 --> 13:21.901
That's exactly right.

13:21.921 --> 13:24.765
You also say your two favorite words are, and yet.

13:26.227 --> 13:26.427
And yet.

13:26.467 --> 13:30.373
And I wonder if you could ever explain it clearly, but has this always been?

13:30.393 --> 13:31.755
And yet, meaning nothing is absolute.

13:33.288 --> 13:38.655
And I think this is the way you've recorded your life, and the way you visualize, you have explained.

13:39.596 --> 13:40.097
That's right.

13:40.197 --> 13:43.161
I'm angry with God, but God is God.

13:43.361 --> 13:43.882
What can I do?

13:43.902 --> 13:45.343
I can't remain angry with my life.

13:46.104 --> 13:47.506
You remain angry with God?

13:48.107 --> 13:49.429
Occasionally.

13:49.509 --> 13:50.870
We are in a school of theology.

13:51.171 --> 13:52.172
No, we protest.

13:52.352 --> 13:52.773
I protest.

13:52.793 --> 13:54.535
I block my faith.

13:54.555 --> 13:58.881
I didn't lose my faith anymore, but it was wounded.

13:58.901 --> 13:59.361
It was wounded.

13:59.902 --> 14:02.265
And therefore, occasionally, I ask God, why did you do that?

14:02.600 --> 14:05.202
Why don't you let it happen?

14:05.222 --> 14:08.406
But to say only God is responsible is wrong.

14:08.766 --> 14:12.650
You will be interested in it afterwards.

14:12.670 --> 14:13.490
You will be interested in it.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.652
It's too easy to say, God, I believe you.

14:15.672 --> 14:17.154
It's too easy.

14:18.395 --> 14:18.615
Sure.

14:19.436 --> 14:25.262
But when you were questioning, you say your faith was never shaken at all, even in the darkest hours.

14:25.442 --> 14:26.162
Even in the darkest hours.

14:26.383 --> 14:28.945
My faith was there, but my faith, indeed,

14:30.443 --> 14:33.407
what you call the loving kindness of God.

14:35.610 --> 14:40.816
When I was an undergraduate years ago in the 60s, I remember reading a book called From Death Camp to Existentialism.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.059
Are you familiar with that book?

14:44.321 --> 14:45.322
I wish I could remember.

14:45.522 --> 14:47.024
I remember the book, yes.

14:47.044 --> 14:52.451
It was quite a remarkable present 30-odd years ago that I read it.

14:52.471 --> 14:53.753
This was just like 20 years ago.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.375
You talk about those experiences.

14:56.116 --> 14:56.957
Sure.

14:57.443 --> 15:06.337
surreal experiences that lead a person who is otherwise very devout towards an existential level.

15:06.657 --> 15:10.703
Are you familiar with Aaron Lansky at the National Yiddish Book Center?

15:10.743 --> 15:15.791
Have you ever heard of it?

15:15.811 --> 15:16.212
Yeah.

15:16.813 --> 15:21.139
I recommended them for the .

15:21.300 --> 15:21.820
Oh, really?

15:21.840 --> 15:22.361
Yeah.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.142
I write about him.

15:23.202 --> 15:24.885
I have a book out now.

15:25.321 --> 15:28.325
It's called A Gentle Madness.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.067
It's going into his fourth print.

15:30.087 --> 15:33.511
It's about the passion for books over 20 years.

15:33.531 --> 15:34.613
Who is publishing it?

15:34.653 --> 15:35.293
Holt.

15:35.314 --> 15:35.494
Holt.

15:36.855 --> 15:43.984
And I have a chapter on Lansky and his attempt to preserve this language.

15:45.186 --> 15:47.709
And I'm curious, you can write in the Yiddish.

15:47.969 --> 15:50.873
I have pages about Yiddish in this book.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.377
I glorify Yiddish quite a lot in this book.

15:54.417 --> 16:09.134
And, of course, my epigraph to that section on the Yiddish section, I quote Ivy Singer in his Nobel lecture, where he talks about Yiddish is not a tenth language.

16:09.154 --> 16:10.235
How do you feel about that?

16:10.255 --> 16:14.760
Of course, the Germans and the Russians tried their best to enjoy it.

16:14.780 --> 16:15.981
I love Yiddish.

16:16.001 --> 16:16.522
I love it.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.623
I spoke Yiddish at home.

16:18.865 --> 16:20.306
I used to work for the forwards.

16:20.406 --> 16:21.788
I wrote Yiddish as I write here.

16:23.759 --> 16:27.964
That was quite a statement that Singer made, though.

16:27.984 --> 16:31.989
He insisted on writing in Yiddish, didn't he, to the end?

16:32.490 --> 16:35.434
Yeah, he was old, and also he did very well.

16:35.614 --> 16:36.635
But he spoke English, right?

16:36.855 --> 16:39.238
Well, English, and he didn't know English.

16:39.258 --> 16:40.700
But he loved English.

16:40.780 --> 16:45.566
He grew up in Yiddish, and furthermore, he felt that it's good.

16:45.586 --> 16:47.569
But it was always the language of the vernacular.

16:48.990 --> 16:53.496
It just took so long for it to be recognized as a literary guy.

16:53.881 --> 16:55.784
19th century.

16:55.804 --> 16:58.007
Now, you feel more comfortable writing in French, I guess.

16:58.087 --> 16:58.988
Only in French.

16:59.509 --> 17:00.670
Comfortable only in French.

17:01.331 --> 17:03.634
But, I mean, your English is perfect.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.096
Do you think in French?

17:05.116 --> 17:06.879
I mean, obviously, you're thinking in English now.

17:06.919 --> 17:11.505
Now, but when I teach, I teach in English, but when I write, I only write in French.

17:11.525 --> 17:13.027
But in French?

17:13.047 --> 17:15.110
In French, yes.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.913
Your wife, does she translate here?

17:16.933 --> 17:18.335
Usually, she translates my book.

17:18.415 --> 17:23.281
This one, she simply worked on a translation done by someone else.

17:23.562 --> 17:23.702
Uh-huh.

17:24.239 --> 17:27.423
Do you feel when somebody else is translating that you want to?

17:29.346 --> 17:31.108
Not with my wife.

17:31.128 --> 17:32.610
I want to, I want peace at home.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.013
I think it's a good idea.

17:35.033 --> 17:44.426
I've talked to so many people, even like Stratis Javieris, across the way that when his first book was, he wrote it in Greek and somebody translated it into English.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.049
I want peace at home.

17:47.069 --> 17:48.691
That's a wonderful book.

17:48.711 --> 17:53.638
I find also, because you have so many years as a journalist, that there is almost a journalistic

17:54.125 --> 17:55.147
There's certain parts.

17:55.187 --> 17:56.669
There's certain parts.

17:56.689 --> 17:59.794
But then you have these monologues.

17:59.814 --> 18:00.896
Of course, that's a device.

18:00.956 --> 18:04.742
That's a stylistic device that you might explain a little bit about.

18:04.903 --> 18:07.848
I mean, because there certainly are literary touches here.

18:07.888 --> 18:09.290
I consider this a literary work.

18:09.490 --> 18:09.831
Yes.

18:11.013 --> 18:12.555
I'm terribly sorry.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.779
I wouldn't interrupt you, but it is a way... My watch.

18:14.799 --> 18:15.180
Stay where you are.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.902
Stay where you are.

18:16.922 --> 18:17.283
Hello.

18:17.403 --> 18:18.245
And I do read them.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.727
Which is there.

18:19.977 --> 18:23.182
which is the most important thing.

18:23.202 --> 18:30.353
So it seems foolish to me to ask you questions of things that you already explained quite fully and most poignantly in the book itself.

18:30.593 --> 18:34.278
I won't take up too much of your time, because I know how busy you are.

18:35.560 --> 18:42.711
But you have indicated that at some point there is a story to be told about what some Jews did to other Jews,

18:42.944 --> 18:46.828
and at this time still perhaps isn't right for that.

18:46.888 --> 18:47.449
Not yet.

18:47.469 --> 18:50.352
I have a black book like that, which I keep talking about.

18:50.372 --> 18:51.413
Truly a black book?

18:53.955 --> 18:54.516
Not now.

18:55.717 --> 19:01.243
I have to go, and there will be instructions when to publish them.

19:01.263 --> 19:01.603
Really?

19:03.305 --> 19:06.087
And is this also an element of bearing witness?

19:07.929 --> 19:10.572
It has to be done.

19:11.159 --> 19:20.150
I think whatever I try to do, even if I write about the Bible, I write about Talmud, and all kinds of things.

19:20.170 --> 19:21.371
For me, writing is very difficult.

19:21.391 --> 19:27.359
So tell me about the experience of covering the Eichmann trial.

19:27.539 --> 19:31.804
I mean, that must have been.

19:31.824 --> 19:36.930
Naturally, it was the man who came to my town.

19:38.902 --> 19:47.534
He and another German officer, they came to supervise the crowning glory of his operation.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.179
And I remember when I used to look at him for hours.

19:51.199 --> 19:53.182
I didn't want him to remove my eyes.

19:53.202 --> 20:01.774
Hoping to find something that should explain the evil of this man, how his human being can become evil.

20:01.794 --> 20:08.503
Hoping to find the monstrous aspect to his personal personality.

20:08.737 --> 20:11.120
Two noses, 40 years, things like that.

20:12.582 --> 20:17.650
Fade well, slept well.

20:17.670 --> 20:18.971
Had a good system of the films.

20:21.355 --> 20:23.718
So you never, it never came to you.

20:24.519 --> 20:27.584
You know, you were saying earlier, how is humanity capable of this?

20:28.024 --> 20:30.728
And you think of the Germans, you think of the rebels.

20:31.265 --> 20:34.508
Because Dr. Goebbels, he had a PhD.

20:34.688 --> 20:51.305
One of my darkest days from when I discovered so many, many years ago that most of the commanding officers of the Einsatzgruppen for the world in murder squads, in Eastern Europe, in Russia, had PhDs.

20:54.668 --> 21:00.934
PhDs in the arts, in theology, in philosophy, in ethics.

21:01.994 --> 21:05.218
and they were doing the killing of machine guns.

21:05.238 --> 21:12.087
One and a half reason Jews were killed like that.

21:12.167 --> 21:22.800
So when you teach, do you say to students, education is important, but humanity is also an element that goes... I say education is not the only shield.

21:24.662 --> 21:25.704
You need something else.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.546
You need some ethical dimensions to that question.

21:30.209 --> 21:35.877
I don't want to take up too much of your time, because I know I can see how I just don't want to miss anything here.

21:36.077 --> 21:42.246
Chris, what is there to say about the Rabin situation in Israel?

21:43.228 --> 21:44.710
You know, I went to the funeral.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.054
I went to Clinton on his plane.

21:51.139 --> 21:53.883
And I went with broken heart.

21:53.903 --> 21:54.944
I came back broken heart.

21:54.964 --> 21:56.246
Because I knew him well.

21:56.266 --> 21:57.668
He was very cross-francy.

22:00.263 --> 22:04.547
Since 1967, it became very interesting.

22:04.567 --> 22:11.493
I've seen him in New York 10 days before I saw this in Washington.

22:11.513 --> 22:12.914
And I introduced him.

22:12.934 --> 22:16.597
He wanted to be the one to introduce him to a shop I didn't know somewhere.

22:16.797 --> 22:17.738
I saw him next day.

22:19.199 --> 22:22.262
After a show, I went to see him nearby.

22:23.363 --> 22:26.385
And we spoke about Boston.

22:26.405 --> 22:29.528
He was terribly disturbed by the hatred

22:30.385 --> 22:43.242
And to take anything away from this?

22:43.603 --> 22:48.970
I mean, is it just madness like everything else?

22:48.990 --> 22:50.653
No, it's hatred.

22:51.313 --> 22:51.714
It's hatred.

22:52.155 --> 22:56.140
And what disturbs us all, I mean, when we think of who blew up

22:57.098 --> 23:04.528
It would have been so easy to blame the Arab experiencers during the federal building in Oklahoma, but it was Americans, wasn't it?

23:04.548 --> 23:06.611
And these are experiencers.

23:06.872 --> 23:10.337
And there's a hotline in New York City as for a defense for this guy.

23:10.417 --> 23:12.540
The obscenity of all that.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.801
There was a rabbi that was on.

23:13.821 --> 23:14.663
I couldn't believe it.

23:14.703 --> 23:17.667
The obscenity of all that.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.009
I was watching this with my wife.

23:19.329 --> 23:21.793
I could shut that man off.

23:21.853 --> 23:23.675
I was yelling at the television.

23:23.695 --> 23:25.037
But they are doing to God, really.

23:25.117 --> 23:25.738
Poor God.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.174
They pick him an accomplice.

23:28.556 --> 23:29.457
They may call him an accomplice.

23:29.477 --> 23:29.797
That's right.

23:29.817 --> 23:32.980
Well, God says you can kill the enemy if the enemy is defined.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.402
They may call him an accomplice.

23:35.503 --> 23:39.287
Are you fearful, or do you think that the country will... I'm fearful.

23:39.307 --> 23:40.328
I'm worried about that.

23:41.189 --> 23:43.371
I mean, do you think Perez has it?

23:43.471 --> 23:44.132
He will have to.

23:44.492 --> 23:46.354
He's not Rabin, but he will have to.

23:47.055 --> 23:47.916
He will help him.

23:47.936 --> 23:50.999
The book that Holt published two years ago was my editor.

23:51.019 --> 23:54.122
It was the same editor of that book who spent time in Israel with...

23:54.642 --> 24:04.593
I really think I have plenty, and I wonder if you'd kindly inscribe a copy of my... Of course.

24:05.534 --> 24:07.796
Just one quick question.

24:07.816 --> 24:15.805
You say, at the very beginning of the book, that you dream of your father all the time, but now you realize you never knew him.

24:15.825 --> 24:20.229
I knew him only in the camp.

24:20.910 --> 24:23.653
He was so busy helping the community.

24:24.983 --> 24:34.913
But your dreams, are you still haunted?

24:34.933 --> 24:37.896
Would you say your dreams, you're haunted by your dreams, or do they help you?

24:37.957 --> 24:38.437
More and more.

24:38.817 --> 24:40.799
Somehow, I think, I'm not the only one, I think.

24:40.820 --> 24:45.424
Many survivors dream more about those years than before.

24:45.444 --> 24:46.185
And are they clear?

24:46.265 --> 24:47.186
Are they real dreams?

24:47.206 --> 24:48.748
Sometimes, yes, sometimes.

24:48.768 --> 24:51.350
In my case, sometimes they're very clear.

24:51.370 --> 24:53.953
Other times, yeah.

24:53.973 --> 24:54.754
I would like to go on the surface.
