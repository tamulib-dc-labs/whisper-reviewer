00:02.933 --> 00:14.354
$5,000, $5,500, $6,000, $6,000, $6,500, $7,000, $7,500, $8,000, $8,000, $8,000.

00:14.374 --> 00:24.672
We've lost $265.

00:25.529 --> 00:54.591
At 3,000 oz, at 3,000 oz, and with the lady, 3,000 or two.

00:56.005 --> 01:02.910
Lot 266.

01:03.835 --> 01:05.857
I have $4,000 now.

01:05.877 --> 01:07.258
I spent $4,000 at $4,000.

01:07.298 --> 01:10.401
That is here at $4,000.

01:10.421 --> 01:12.583
$4,500.

01:12.603 --> 01:14.165
$4,800.

01:14.185 --> 01:16.887
$5,000.

01:16.907 --> 01:17.047
$5,500.

01:17.067 --> 01:17.448
$6,000.

01:17.528 --> 01:18.889
$6,500.

01:18.909 --> 01:19.329
$7,000.

01:19.349 --> 01:21.271
At $7,000, it's still with me at $7,000.

01:21.291 --> 01:21.872
$7,500.

01:21.892 --> 01:23.754
$8,000 against you.

01:24.034 --> 01:25.375
$8,500 in the room now.

01:25.675 --> 01:27.437
At $8,500 in the center.

01:27.657 --> 01:29.319
At $8,500 anymore.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.762
$8,500 will last $8,500.

01:33.367 --> 01:34.170
503.

01:41.154 --> 01:45.570
Lot 267.

01:47.322 --> 01:50.068
I have 2,900 bid-offs now.

01:50.088 --> 01:52.553
2,900 is bid at $2,900.

01:52.893 --> 01:58.324
At 2,900, the next bid's $3,000, actually $3,000.

01:58.344 --> 02:00.268
On the island, $3,000.

02:00.288 --> 02:03.094
At $3,000, at $3,000, at $3,000, at $3,000.

02:03.114 --> 02:04.056
It'll be $2,000 now.

02:04.076 --> 02:05.719
It'll be $500.

02:08.078 --> 02:09.480
$3,500 in front.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.423
$3,500 at $3,500.

02:12.364 --> 02:12.825
At $3,500.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.289
$3,800, yes, I've seen it.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.771
$3,800 at the very back.

02:16.931 --> 02:17.372
$4,000.

02:17.392 --> 02:18.473
$4,200.

02:18.553 --> 02:22.739
$4,200 at the back of the room.

02:23.140 --> 02:23.701
At $4,200.

02:23.721 --> 02:24.762
At $4,200.

02:24.782 --> 02:26.405
$4,500.

02:26.425 --> 02:26.986
$4,800.

02:27.006 --> 02:28.408
$5,000.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.292
And $5,000 on my left at $5,000 then.

02:31.913 --> 02:33.375
And $5,000 all done.

02:33.856 --> 02:35.037
$5,000.

02:35.057 --> 02:36.820
We would find four, three, three.

02:59.378 --> 03:02.904
Big Washington, I don't estimate it to $90,000 to $100,000.

03:03.465 --> 03:06.831
Washington's first efforts present for that.

03:06.851 --> 03:07.432
$268,000.

03:07.452 --> 03:12.622
$50,000 for this, please.

03:12.642 --> 03:13.784
$50,000.

03:14.425 --> 03:15.066
$50,000.

03:15.086 --> 03:16.629
$55,000.

03:16.649 --> 03:17.390
$55,000.

03:17.410 --> 03:18.412
$55,000.

03:18.432 --> 03:18.953
$60,000.

03:19.534 --> 03:20.796
$65,000.

03:20.776 --> 03:21.517
$65,000.

03:21.577 --> 03:30.708
$75,000.

03:30.728 --> 03:31.169
$80,000.

03:31.189 --> 03:32.671
$85,000.

03:33.111 --> 03:33.472
$85,000.

03:33.492 --> 03:34.253
$90,000.

03:34.273 --> 03:38.939
At the back of the road now, $90,000.

03:39.619 --> 03:43.464
Seated at the back of the road, $90,000.

03:43.504 --> 03:44.045
$90,000.

03:44.065 --> 03:44.626
$90,000.

03:44.966 --> 03:47.790
$90,000.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.011
$90,000.

03:53.210 --> 04:04.907
Lot 269.

04:05.900 --> 04:32.076
uh six thousand dollars for this six thousand six five hundred seven thousand thirty five hundred seventy five hundred dollars then at seventy five hundred dollars eight thousand eighty five hundred nine thousand ninety five hundred ten thousand dollars ten thousand dollars ten thousand dollars eleven thousand now twelve thousand thirteen thousand fourteen thousand fifteen thousand sixteen thousand seventeen thousand eighteen thousand nineteen thousand

04:32.410 --> 04:36.095
$19,000.

04:36.215 --> 04:37.537
All done.

04:37.577 --> 04:38.578
$270.

04:39.439 --> 04:56.863
I have three things on this and I must say $7,000.

04:56.923 --> 04:57.544
$7,000.

04:57.564 --> 04:58.285
$7,000.

04:58.305 --> 05:00.508
$7,000.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.130
With me at $7,7500.

05:03.325 --> 05:06.590
At $85,000 now in the room, at $85,000, $9,000 against me.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.233
At $9,000, see, look at the back, at $9,000.

05:09.253 --> 05:14.000
At $9,000, then.

05:14.901 --> 05:15.843
At $95,000.

05:15.863 --> 05:17.665
At $9,500, on my right at $9,900, it's not going to be fair.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.346
$10,000 now, for the government.

05:18.366 --> 05:19.929
At $10,000, the government is not going to be fair.

05:19.949 --> 05:21.711
$10,000 now, for the government.

05:21.811 --> 05:28.000
At $10,000, the government is going to be fair.

05:31.388 --> 05:36.334
What number does that mean?

05:36.354 --> 05:38.037
1716.

05:38.057 --> 05:38.337
1716.

05:38.357 --> 05:38.998
Thank you.

05:39.018 --> 05:40.680
Lot 271.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.524
I have to attend three visits on this line, $3,600.

05:43.644 --> 05:47.529
The minutes will be at $6,600 at $6,000.

05:47.809 --> 05:51.253
I'll still learn again, $6,500 in time.

05:51.414 --> 05:57.902
$6,500 across the back row, $6,500 to be walked up at $6,500.

06:06.404 --> 06:08.786
Block 272, I have $2,000.

06:08.806 --> 06:10.468
$2,000 is it?

06:10.488 --> 06:11.369
That's $2,000.

06:11.389 --> 006:15.774
$2,000.

06:15.894 --> 06:16.935
$2,500.

06:17.455 --> 06:18.396
$2,800.

06:18.416 --> 06:19.457
$3,000.

06:20.378 --> 06:21.019
$3,200.

06:21.039 --> 06:21.680
$3,500.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.380
$2,800.

06:22.420 --> 06:22.961
$4,000.

06:23.061 --> 06:24.042
$4,200.

06:24.102 --> 06:24.823
$4,500.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.244
$4,800.

06:26.264 --> 06:28.847
$5,000.

06:28.907 --> 06:32.190
$5,500.

06:32.311 --> 06:34.012
$5,500.

06:34.032 --> 06:34.673
$5,500.

06:34.653 --> 06:52.227
And five, now the five of the dot.

06:52.347 --> 06:53.589
Two, one, four, four.

06:53.609 --> 06:53.910
Lot 273.

06:54.802 --> 07:16.557
In other words, $600 for it, $650, $750, $850, $850, $850, $850, $850, $950, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,300, $1,400, $1,500.

07:17.768 --> 07:28.599
1,600, 1,700, 1,700, on the very back is 1,700 at 1,700 on the back row, at 1,700 on the wall, 1,700 at 1,251.

07:35.726 --> 07:41.372
And lots of 244, the first of two lots about the garage is of 274, sorry.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.758
First of two lots about the garage in the building, number two.

07:48.599 --> 07:53.625
Um, it's not too, not too 74.

07:53.645 --> 07:58.071
I never noticed he missed $7,000 on these at $7,000.

07:58.091 --> 07:59.553
It is here at $7,000.

07:59.573 --> 08:02.256
It might look at $7,000 then.

08:02.397 --> 08:05.460
$7,000 is nothing.

08:05.481 --> 08:06.582
$7,000 anymore.

08:06.742 --> 08:07.403
$7,000.

08:07.423 --> 08:08.024
$7,500.

08:08.044 --> 08:09.546
$8,000.

08:09.566 --> 08:11.929
$8,000 just against you.

08:11.989 --> 08:13.551
$8,500.

08:13.591 --> 08:14.071
$9,000.

08:14.091 --> 08:15.353
$9,000 against you.

08:15.373 --> 08:16.054
$9,500.

08:16.114 --> 08:17.576
$10,000.

08:17.596 --> 08:18.437
$10,000.

08:18.839 --> 08:47.985
Mr. Leonor Gaylock.

08:50.328 --> 08:52.010
I have a letter to read about this.

08:53.491 --> 09:02.661
We are informed of the existence of another apparently authentic version of the Enola Gay Log, August 6, 1945, in private overview.

09:03.822 --> 09:10.610
The owner of that copy informs us that it is earmarked for donation to American institutions.

09:10.630 --> 09:16.656
The numerical portion of the log being offered to say that Christie is in an unidentified hand

09:16.973 --> 09:24.903
Therefore, Christians cannot determine authoritatively that this log was maintained during the mission.

09:24.923 --> 09:44.466
We want that the Lewis log offered here is an authentic record, and that the cover sheets, page headings, some annotations, and the signed attestation at the end are in the handwriting of the late Captain Robert A. Lewis, the co-pilot of the Enola Gay on August 6, 1945.

09:44.800 --> 09:58.880
We believe that the Lewis law was made contemporaneously with the mission.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.604
$40,000 for this week.

10:01.704 --> 10:03.467
$40,000.

10:03.818 --> 10:04.559
$40,000.

10:04.579 --> 10:10.248
$45,000, $50,000, $55,000.

10:10.950 --> 10:14.435
We still left $55,000, $55,000.

10:14.816 --> 10:17.039
I want my Japanese down.

10:17.059 --> 10:24.872
$55,000 for the last time, $55,000.

10:24.972 --> 10:29.439
$55,000 passed.

10:29.459 --> 10:30.501
I'm brought in.

10:36.404 --> 11:04.352
and what uh um

11:04.332 --> 11:05.275
$3,000.

11:05.295 --> 11:05.736
$3,000.

11:05.776 --> 11:06.217
$2,500.

11:06.237 --> 11:06.558
$4,200.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.042
$4,200.

11:08.103 --> 11:19.033
$4,500.

11:19.283 --> 11:24.671
The owner of the other one called a $5,500 at $6,000.

11:24.691 --> 11:26.033
Only $6,000.

11:26.174 --> 11:27.956
At $6,000.

11:28.137 --> 11:29.499
At $6,000.

11:29.799 --> 11:31.562
At $6,000.

11:31.742 --> 11:35.588
At $6,000.

11:36.007 --> 12:00.073
There will be a delay in the process of maintenance.

12:00.053 --> 12:06.046
I guess 15 years of electing.

12:06.066 --> 12:08.211
40 minutes of auction.

12:08.231 --> 12:15.126
Yeah, but you can see kind of the more routine kind of stuff.

12:15.713 --> 12:18.878
The one here is right.

12:18.978 --> 12:21.582
If you look at it, you're in the army.

12:21.622 --> 12:35.983
You're looking over to what the manuscript is, and this guy calls, and everything got panicked, and the mistake made was telling Rita Wright, hey, there's another one out there.

12:36.003 --> 12:36.664
So what happened?

12:36.684 --> 12:41.772
Yeah, okay, yeah.

12:42.022 --> 12:45.395
The next time around, I just... Okay.

12:45.616 --> 12:47.564
How did you make it out of here today?

12:47.765 --> 12:50.395
Quote a lot for a lot.

12:51.337 --> 13:02.034
He believes that it's a genuine document.

13:02.054 --> 13:10.989
We had a higher bid on it, but we weren't going to get it until we saw more agony.

13:11.009 --> 13:13.493
This is Keller, a senior doctor.

13:13.513 --> 13:18.120
We would have been higher on it.

13:18.421 --> 13:23.488
When did we... I can't answer that.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.251
It was early in the week.

13:25.371 --> 13:30.518
It's in the New York Times.

13:30.538 --> 13:34.063
Have you read the New York Times?

13:34.264 --> 13:39.211
Well, if you have a look, it's in the New York Times.

13:39.231 --> 13:47.162
In my opinion, if there was maybe another, and another, and another, we would have a marketer, right?

13:47.395 --> 13:49.422
What happens to the log now?

13:49.964 --> 13:50.947
No idea.

13:50.967 --> 13:55.583
So it goes back to the owner or to the consignee, I guess?

13:56.052 --> 13:58.215
I don't know.

13:58.456 --> 14:07.449
Are you surprised by the response to it or anything of what Rita did this morning was kind of a kiss of death to the... No, I don't think Rita Reif's article had anything to do with it at all.

14:08.310 --> 14:22.110
I think that the existence of a second of another authentic version of the law, possibly authentic, we haven't examined it completely, we've seen photocopies of it, is...

14:22.090 --> 14:27.197
It undeniably made what was said in the catalogue not as described.

14:28.198 --> 14:36.409
So that would introduce some anxiety, perhaps, among prospective buyers.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.875
I mean, it was brought in.

14:41.868 --> 14:48.117
It was expected to be a contested item.

14:48.137 --> 14:48.738
Apparently it wasn't.

14:48.798 --> 14:52.003
Do you ever have a feel for why that was?

14:52.023 --> 14:54.686
Well, because of the sale notice.

14:54.706 --> 14:58.031
Well, that's basically what I'm saying.

14:58.051 --> 15:01.296
Well, that's what you're saying.

15:01.316 --> 15:02.478
Thank you.

15:03.980 --> 15:04.180
Thank you.

15:04.430 --> 15:07.196
Did you do well?

15:08.338 --> 15:09.420
Almost did well, yeah.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.544
I mean, the autograph market's very strong.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.408
The autograph market's very strong.

15:13.468 --> 15:15.031
Who's the kind of writing for it?

15:15.112 --> 15:16.093
I don't know.

15:16.234 --> 15:17.075
You have to ask him.

15:17.096 --> 15:17.797
He's still writing.

15:17.817 --> 15:18.418
He's still writing.

15:18.478 --> 15:19.300
He's a book.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.827
There was no interest in the end bank at all.

15:23.093 --> 15:26.196
You know, we're batting 50-50.

15:26.276 --> 15:29.179
We turned down Amtrak, and we turned down the leaf and left.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.281
But the pen was phoned from $50,000.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.823
Do you have to get your pen?

15:32.963 --> 15:33.504
No, I don't know.

15:33.524 --> 15:34.144
I don't know.

15:34.244 --> 15:34.865
You want a pen?

15:34.925 --> 15:35.866
I'll get you a pen.

15:36.006 --> 15:37.388
Well, they don't want that.

15:37.408 --> 15:38.809
Why should they pay for a stupid pen?

15:38.829 --> 15:40.171
No, we would pay $50,000 for that.

15:40.191 --> 15:41.172
Well, some of the sugar news.

15:41.192 --> 15:42.873
The world are full of the sugar news.

15:42.893 --> 15:47.638
Who was the gal with the ponytail that was bidding heavily in front of you on the right?

15:47.918 --> 15:49.720
I thought she was corpse, and then she left.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.361
No, no, no.

15:50.741 --> 15:51.362
Excuse me to do that.

15:51.713 --> 16:18.362
What you've really got here

16:18.747 --> 16:21.500
What is Caller?

16:21.520 --> 16:25.397
Caller has a lot of... Is he a private collector?

16:25.659 --> 16:28.150
Callers are ex-stamp dealers in the stamp market.

16:28.501 --> 16:35.531
To put, Nick, they're in this field, and the stamp guys and real estate guys are following them into this.

16:35.732 --> 16:43.503
The autograph marks, it remains quite strong, but in large parts, you go somewhere like Keller comes into it.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.007
Yeah, well, before we get the guy, we're too far below.

16:46.107 --> 16:46.948
How did he do today?

16:47.389 --> 16:50.213
We spent about, we must have spent $125,000.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.638
Yeah, but you were very conservative.

16:53.658 --> 16:54.559
No, on a lot of things.

16:54.539 --> 17:15.113
i was watching some things are yeah i mean we have our friends he doesn't like cholera he may not stop yeah but does he ever set him on how much he was going to spend oh yeah yeah we have no in total or in our individual letters about that it's like i mean i was getting things what well let's get conservative i had bids on items i was getting for 4 000 i had a bit of 30 pounds

17:15.464 --> 17:16.827
How do you tell for all this press interest?

17:16.847 --> 17:17.989
Do you think it was the Enola game?

17:18.090 --> 17:19.092
Only the Enola game.

17:19.212 --> 17:19.833
Nothing else.

17:19.853 --> 17:20.895
Only the Enola game.

17:20.915 --> 17:24.884
I mean, because I've been coming to these things for a year and a half.

17:24.904 --> 17:25.826
This is a big thing.

17:26.026 --> 17:29.413
It was an idea, I think it was, you can ask for approval.

17:29.433 --> 17:30.756
You know, you might want to...

17:30.736 --> 17:37.825
But there was a lot of interest in Japan, but it didn't materialize in anything.

17:38.126 --> 17:39.668
Is the girl from Forbes still here?

17:39.688 --> 17:40.589
No, she left.

17:40.729 --> 17:43.793
They didn't do anything on that.

17:43.853 --> 17:45.595
They were busy here today, though.

17:45.675 --> 17:47.278
They were busy, but they didn't go on this.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.820
Maybe not in Forbes if you were alive.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.082
Who were the players, did you notice, on the Enola Gate?

17:51.563 --> 17:53.065
No players.

17:53.230 --> 17:54.293
There's no players.

17:54.313 --> 17:56.039
There's no action.

17:56.059 --> 18:04.084
You know, there was a reserve on the piece, and the auctioneer took it up a bit, and saw that it was hopeless, and the phones didn't ring, and the cameras were rolling, and you...

18:04.233 --> 18:18.688
So we got into the business, yeah.

18:18.748 --> 18:28.639
How long have you been in the book business, the autograph business?

18:30.761 --> 18:32.603
Autograph business for about 10 years.

18:33.157 --> 18:37.382
But you've really become... Seth and Robin have just branched out in it professionally, you know, two years.

18:37.482 --> 18:39.805
And they're the ones with the clients in autographs.

18:39.825 --> 18:40.105
Who is?

18:41.126 --> 18:43.809
My son was being interviewed by the Japanese television.

18:43.829 --> 18:44.870
That's my daughter, Robin.

18:45.852 --> 18:50.517
And they've been in it since they were bar mitzvahed.

18:50.537 --> 18:53.581
They've been in it since half their life.

18:53.601 --> 18:56.564
Now, are you buying for stock today or for clients?

18:56.864 --> 18:57.745
We buy for clients.

18:57.946 --> 18:59.808
I buy a few items for myself.

18:59.928 --> 19:02.090
The items I buy under the 311.

19:02.551 --> 19:02.691
Mm-hmm.

19:03.076 --> 19:09.746
how to refer our own family collections, because we're collectors.

19:11.148 --> 19:14.513
When I first started, I wasn't in the business.

19:14.633 --> 19:18.138
I was in another business, and I had sold it to a public company.

19:18.259 --> 19:28.594
I had money burning a hole in my pocket, and my Merrill Lynch broker was anxious to get his hands on it, and he got a piece of it, which I subsequently lost.

19:28.844 --> 19:35.054
And there was an upside-down airmail stamp coming up at an auction the week after I had this money in my pocket.

19:35.074 --> 19:38.419
So I went to that auction, I stuck my hand up, and I didn't let it down.

19:39.060 --> 19:40.202
That was a boyhood dream.

19:40.683 --> 19:43.107
So there's the collector.

19:43.508 --> 19:44.790
I'm really not doing stamps.

19:45.050 --> 19:51.781
Could you tell me who the collector was?

19:51.821 --> 19:54.345
Were you buying for one collector today or a number of collectors?

19:54.663 --> 19:55.724
Several collectors.

19:56.065 --> 19:57.226
Anonymous collectors?

19:57.527 --> 19:58.748
Oh, one is very famous.

19:59.109 --> 20:01.112
He's still anonymous, but he's famous.

20:01.432 --> 20:04.416
Would you think he'd like to be interviewed for a book that's going to be published in 1992?

20:05.257 --> 20:05.878
No, maybe.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.463
Maybe, but right now, no, because we're still buying.

20:10.985 --> 20:16.071
See, when you're buying, you don't tip too much of a hand because you're still buying.

20:17.974 --> 20:23.421
But we... So this person... We represent some very...

20:23.924 --> 20:24.985
sophisticated.

20:26.027 --> 20:30.874
So this is the individual basically you've been buying for noticeably in the last couple of months.

20:31.635 --> 20:31.995
Several.

20:32.336 --> 20:34.118
We have two Lincoln collectors.

20:34.178 --> 20:34.559
Two.

20:38.564 --> 20:39.586
How do you balance that?

20:39.606 --> 20:40.507
How do you bid for two?

20:40.527 --> 20:53.425
I guess you have to... Because it happens that in the particular case of Lincoln collections, the two gentlemen know each other and

20:54.164 --> 20:59.472
And if otherwise, we don't.

20:59.532 --> 21:06.502
We can't bid against ourselves, or we can't bid one collector against another.

21:07.563 --> 21:08.305
We can't do it.

21:08.325 --> 21:10.648
We can't take on competitive jobs.

21:11.069 --> 21:12.971
It's a big jury back in Tokyo, I guess.

21:13.051 --> 21:15.194
Were you interested in the log?

21:15.215 --> 21:15.875
Yeah, we had a bid.

21:16.336 --> 21:17.758
We had a higher bid.

21:17.778 --> 21:18.940
How come you didn't?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.083
Because we smelled that it would pass.

21:22.379 --> 21:25.884
We don't like bidding against water coolers.

21:25.945 --> 21:27.307
We have experience in that.

21:27.347 --> 21:28.889
Sometimes you can just feel things.

21:28.909 --> 21:29.730
You can't always be right.

21:29.851 --> 21:31.293
Well, you think it's right?

21:31.333 --> 21:32.194
You think it's a real thing?

21:32.855 --> 21:33.096
Yes.

21:33.677 --> 21:34.518
So why didn't you buy it?

21:35.259 --> 21:39.466
Because it wouldn't have, what did it knock down at?

21:39.866 --> 21:40.167
65.

21:40.307 --> 21:43.312
It wouldn't have knocked down at 60 if I shut my hand up.

21:44.774 --> 21:45.435
So we know better.

21:46.477 --> 21:48.640
Otherwise, I would have bought it at 125.

21:49.210 --> 21:51.614
if I had competitive bidding.

21:52.035 --> 21:52.676
I don't understand.

21:53.637 --> 21:55.961
So you have to learn a little more about your bid?

21:55.981 --> 21:59.107
Why would you go to 65?

21:59.127 --> 22:00.749
I don't see the strategy.

22:01.591 --> 22:05.056
Because you have to understand more about the back.

22:05.277 --> 22:06.499
No, but it was reserved.

22:06.619 --> 22:07.120
It passed.

22:07.561 --> 22:11.307
PASS means you don't know what I'm buying or the seller.

22:11.347 --> 22:13.210
The seller had a higher reserve.

22:13.460 --> 22:14.822
And you don't know what that was?

22:14.842 --> 22:15.704
You were just guessing?

22:15.724 --> 22:22.816
That I don't know, but we smelled that perhaps the seller needs a moment of truth.

22:24.479 --> 22:31.031
And on the other hand, there wasn't enough information out on it until just this week.

22:31.071 --> 22:32.092
We would have been a buyer.

22:32.153 --> 22:32.734
We had a bid.

22:33.074 --> 22:33.595
We had a bid.

22:34.857 --> 22:35.901
Right, very interesting.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.749
So it gets a little intricate.

22:37.770 --> 22:38.854
I'll give you a call.

22:38.874 --> 22:39.396
Anytime.

22:39.738 --> 22:42.269
Does Romulus have to give you a card?

22:42.289 --> 22:43.956
I'd like the card.
