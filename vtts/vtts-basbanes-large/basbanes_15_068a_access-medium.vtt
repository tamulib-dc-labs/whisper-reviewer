WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:07.470
Okay, the tape recorder is on.

00:09.312 --> 00:10.353
Where do we start?

00:13.817 --> 00:20.824
It amazes me that you are, I think, probably the best-selling author in the United States.

00:21.564 --> 00:24.127
Anyone that sells more than you, I'd be surprised.

00:24.447 --> 00:25.889
There isn't in the past few years.

00:28.071 --> 00:34.037
Stu Apobal was saying a little bit earlier that Bantam shipped seven million books in the past year.

00:35.165 --> 00:39.409
And yet, for some reason, you aren't reviewed, are you?

00:39.429 --> 00:39.669
No.

00:39.949 --> 00:44.333
Could you first tell me why you think that is?

00:45.074 --> 00:48.137
Well, I think there's a kind of a prejudice against stories about the West.

00:49.458 --> 00:53.221
I think there was a lot of bad writing about the West for a long time.

00:54.102 --> 01:01.669
And as a result, I think that that's been the basic trouble.

01:01.689 --> 01:04.952
But it doesn't disturb me the least, because I write for readers.

01:06.164 --> 01:07.465
And if they review them, fine.

01:07.485 --> 01:08.707
If they don't, that's fine, too.

01:09.608 --> 01:13.091
But I have several million readers out there who seem happy.

01:14.233 --> 01:19.558
And one reason I enjoy making trips like this is because I usually have some autograph sessions.

01:20.239 --> 01:24.163
And when I do, I get a chance to talk to them and get feedback.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.826
Would you say that you write a genre?

01:26.846 --> 01:27.967
Are you a genre writer?

01:27.987 --> 01:29.309
No, I don't really think I am.

01:29.349 --> 01:32.372
Because when I first began to write, I wrote short stories.

01:32.692 --> 01:33.333
And I wrote everything.

01:34.474 --> 01:35.175
All kinds of short stories.

01:35.594 --> 01:37.577
anything you can imagine.

01:37.597 --> 01:50.373
And I fell into the writing about the frontier largely because I wrote a short story called The Gift of Cochise that was published by Kuyers.

01:51.855 --> 01:59.345
And one of the editors at Fawcett saw it and asked me to do a novel based on a short story about 1972.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.572
And I did, and everybody wanted the story of the frontier from it after that.

02:05.075 --> 02:08.759
So my story started in England in 1600, and come over here.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.883
England, Ireland, Scotland, places like that.

02:11.903 --> 02:23.155
And I had one story that it didn't actually start right here in Boston, but the first 80 pages that would take place in this vicinity, the Warrior's Path.

02:23.996 --> 02:29.742
It used to be an Indian trail that ran from Chattanooga, Tennessee, up to this vicinity.

02:30.844 --> 02:34.828
And the Iroquois Indians used to leave here and go down there to fight the Cherokees.

02:35.315 --> 02:37.759
And the Cherokees used to come back up here to fight the Uroquois.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.325
But that trail was probably a couple thousand years old for any white man ever sold this country.

02:43.046 --> 02:47.493
Your appeal certainly goes far beyond our shores.

02:47.513 --> 02:50.297
It's a worldwide appeal.

02:50.497 --> 02:52.100
You sell books in how many languages?

02:52.120 --> 02:52.560
Nineteen.

02:53.061 --> 02:54.563
Nineteen languages.

02:54.583 --> 02:58.629
What does this say about the Western?

02:58.649 --> 03:00.412
Well, it has a vast appeal, obviously.

03:00.572 --> 03:02.014
It has a vast appeal to a lot of people.

03:02.416 --> 03:08.021
I think part of it is probably the man on the horseback thing, which they've always been a romantic figure.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.109
But there's much else than that.

03:16.189 --> 03:19.892
The whole idea of the American West has appealed to people all over the world.

03:20.613 --> 03:25.077
And whenever I go anywhere, they all want to hear stories about it, you know, and ask me questions about it.

03:25.237 --> 03:26.558
What are they most interested in?

03:26.578 --> 03:27.059
The myths?

03:27.880 --> 03:30.482
You said the romantic things.

03:31.053 --> 03:34.798
Well, the West was a romantic period, you know, an exciting period.

03:34.818 --> 03:41.066
Romance is kind of hard to define, but it was a period when a lot of things were happening, a lot of what we call adventure.

03:41.927 --> 03:44.551
Adventure's just a romantic name for trouble, that's all it is.

03:45.632 --> 03:50.058
A lot of things were happening over here, but exciting things, a rather normal one.

03:50.559 --> 03:57.187
So people got very intrigued by it, and also by the idea that the Western man was always an individual.

03:58.609 --> 04:00.672
He didn't work as a team, but very rarely.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.629
He was on his own.

04:02.649 --> 04:04.891
Not a loner necessarily.

04:05.031 --> 04:07.333
Not necessarily a loner, but on his own and doing things.

04:07.353 --> 04:14.499
And when he wanted to, when he got fed up, he just got in his horse and rode off into the sunset or wherever and left everything behind.

04:14.519 --> 04:17.182
And this is sort of an appeal to people too.

04:18.122 --> 04:22.566
But it's very hard to pin down the exact reason why the Western has become so popular.

04:23.267 --> 04:27.831
How about your personal appeal?

04:27.851 --> 04:28.992
Do you have any insight on that?

04:29.012 --> 04:30.473
The only thing is that

04:30.655 --> 04:35.660
I think they have come to realize that I write an authentic story.

04:36.941 --> 04:38.682
That I write a story based on truth.

04:39.803 --> 04:42.566
And when they read my stories, they can say, yes, this is how it was.

04:44.307 --> 04:48.351
I write my stories actually for a man of the period I'm writing about.

04:49.492 --> 04:50.973
He's always in the back of my mind.

04:51.034 --> 04:54.737
And I keep thinking, well, if he was here to read this story, what would he think about it?

04:55.698 --> 04:56.799
And I try to write for him.

04:57.459 --> 04:59.802
So this character has actually come alive for you.

04:59.822 --> 05:00.342
That's right.

05:01.064 --> 05:09.697
That's right, they do, and I try to put my readers in the story, and a lot of them comment on that fact, and they feel that I do.

05:10.719 --> 05:17.950
I like to have them smell the smells, and taste the taste, and hear the sounds, and put them right there in the thing.

05:20.194 --> 05:24.961
I had another question.

05:24.981 --> 05:26.604
You do a tremendous amount of research.

05:26.624 --> 05:27.465
Yes.

05:27.705 --> 05:29.468
Could you give me some idea of the research

05:30.140 --> 05:34.786
Well, I cover the field.

05:34.907 --> 05:37.510
I do research in a lot of diaries and journals.

05:38.732 --> 05:44.079
And contrary to what a lot of them may think, we don't have to guess what happened.

05:44.099 --> 05:44.520
We know.

05:45.181 --> 05:47.804
Because there were people there at the time writing it all down.

05:49.226 --> 05:50.929
And there are a lot of journals available.

05:51.530 --> 05:55.936
And I have readers sending them to me every once in a while their grandparents or great-grandparents had.

05:56.677 --> 05:59.100
And a lot of them are in libraries or historical societies.

05:59.789 --> 06:04.435
Then nearly every one of those towns had a small town newspaper, sometimes two.

06:05.877 --> 06:11.424
And they would publish the stories of what was happening at the time.

06:11.444 --> 06:17.172
Some very funny stories about it because the only way they could make money was by circulation, you know.

06:17.192 --> 06:18.714
But it wasn't much made from ads.

06:19.455 --> 06:21.337
And the circulation dropped off, they were in trouble.

06:22.319 --> 06:24.081
So suppose you have a newspaper and I have one.

06:24.401 --> 06:25.242
We'd start a fight.

06:26.824 --> 06:28.767
We might like each other and drink together,

06:29.017 --> 06:31.700
We'd start a fight, and fight back and forth in the editorial.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.884
And the guy's the body of paper to read what was going on, you know.

06:34.904 --> 06:36.365
And then you get sick.

06:37.526 --> 06:41.551
So I would go over and write your, and then come back and write an answer to it, you know.

06:41.571 --> 06:43.653
Because we had to keep the fight going for circulation.

06:43.994 --> 06:51.902
If this era was so well documented, as you point out, how do you explain the mythology?

06:52.003 --> 06:54.345
What you point out is false.

06:54.365 --> 06:56.588
Nobody goes to documentation.

06:56.608 --> 06:58.770
I mean, this mythology started almost

06:59.105 --> 07:00.867
Yes, it did.

07:00.887 --> 07:01.869
It did.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.091
He started building and a lot of it isn't false.

07:04.111 --> 07:06.835
A lot of it is true, but a lot of it is exaggerated.

07:07.856 --> 07:10.800
Now the role of the gunfighter in the West has been much exaggerated.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.422
I don't mean to say he wasn't there.

07:12.442 --> 07:12.863
He was.

07:13.323 --> 07:14.305
He was very definitely there.

07:14.865 --> 07:20.633
But the gunfights mostly took place on the wrong side of the tracks, on the other side of town.

07:20.693 --> 07:23.897
The red light district are out on the plains someplace on the range.

07:24.434 --> 07:31.701
There were lots of people there who went to church on Sunday and sent the kids to school and raised their families just like we do now.

07:33.243 --> 07:43.733
But the gunfighter wasn't really as common in this period as... He was common, but I mean, he didn't occupy any position of honor or anything like that.

07:44.193 --> 07:47.676
Some of them were very respected men, but they were respected for other reasons than that.

07:48.798 --> 07:53.462
Generally speaking, I think you spoke it out in the 16th Renaissance debut, that

07:54.202 --> 07:56.925
On the whole, this is a pretty tough lot of people.

07:57.506 --> 07:57.847
It was.

07:57.907 --> 07:58.928
Civil War vets.

07:59.348 --> 08:05.917
I mean, they're not likely to be intimidated by some crackpot coming into town and terrorizing them.

08:05.937 --> 08:06.397
They weren't.

08:06.477 --> 08:07.499
They weren't intimidated.

08:07.539 --> 08:09.321
Let me give you some examples.

08:13.686 --> 08:19.614
Well, the Jesse James gang, who were a tough bunch, they decided to raid Northfield, Minnesota.

08:20.675 --> 08:23.078
Now, this wasn't what was usually considered a western town.

08:23.699 --> 08:27.444
It was in Minnesota, away from the cattle driving west and everything.

08:28.245 --> 08:31.189
They rode in there and got shot to pieces by a bunch of farmers and businessmen.

08:32.131 --> 08:35.495
What you have to realize is that all these people grew up using guns.

08:36.677 --> 08:37.438
They grew up hunting.

08:38.119 --> 08:40.803
In many cases, if they didn't shoot meat to the table, they didn't have it.

08:41.403 --> 08:41.844
They didn't eat.

08:43.326 --> 08:46.570
Annie Oakley, the famous woman, rifle shot, you know.

08:46.590 --> 08:47.732
That's the way she began.

08:48.185 --> 08:54.113
She began hunting meat for her own family and found out she could make more money that way by hunting birds and whatnot to the market.

08:54.153 --> 08:55.615
She was a terrific shot.

08:55.836 --> 08:56.837
Marvelous shot.

08:56.897 --> 08:58.039
That's not exaggerating.

08:58.059 --> 08:58.359
Oh, no.

08:58.379 --> 08:59.381
That's not exaggeration.

08:59.401 --> 09:00.142
She was marvelous.

09:01.564 --> 09:05.169
This Wild West show came around with Frank Butler, you know, who was a great pistol shot.

09:05.509 --> 09:07.472
And he was giving exhibitions.

09:07.492 --> 09:13.961
And in each town, to increase the excitement, he would take on the local rifle or pistol champion.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.425
And, of course, he had no trouble beating him.

09:16.785 --> 09:18.107
And he openly shot circles around.

09:18.897 --> 09:22.042
So he married her.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.625
He couldn't have anybody better than he was around.

09:24.706 --> 09:27.990
I suppose so many of the myths have been born into the ground.

09:28.010 --> 09:34.700
But in the research, do you ever come up with some really new stories and excitement that could have been myths, but maybe were overlooked?

09:34.720 --> 09:35.221
Oh, yes.

09:35.381 --> 09:41.190
There's a lot of them, for instance.

09:41.230 --> 09:48.280
There's a lot of them.

09:48.563 --> 09:59.898
Well, I just finished writing a story in Buckskin Run about two Indian tribes were having a fight over a hot spring in Colorado, Pagosa Springs.

09:59.958 --> 10:06.547
But the Navajos and the Utes were fighting over it.

10:06.567 --> 10:13.997
And they decided, finally, rather than go to war, they'd pick a champion and let them fight it out and go with that decision.

10:14.703 --> 10:29.211
So the Navajos picked a great big husky young warrior who was a noted fighting man, and the youth picked a white man who was a adopted member of the tribe, Colonel Albert H. Pfeiffer, and he fought the Navajo and beat him.

10:30.633 --> 10:31.715
And there are many great stories.

10:31.956 --> 10:34.340
Stories come out of the woodwork every time you turn around.

10:34.841 --> 10:37.386
It's a new story and a different story.

10:39.104 --> 10:40.326
What's the woodwork for you?

10:40.346 --> 10:41.908
I mean, you're doing research.

10:41.948 --> 10:47.635
I'm doing research in the files, bold newspapers, and diaries, things like that.

10:48.637 --> 10:53.964
And people all know about Wild Bill Hickok and John Wesley Harden and some of those.

10:54.324 --> 10:57.969
But there are many, many other fellows who were just as famous in their time.

10:58.490 --> 11:01.414
And others who weren't famous at all who were just as good with guns.

11:02.555 --> 11:03.757
And they grew up using them.

11:04.277 --> 11:07.382
And they didn't fool around.

11:07.402 --> 11:08.503
Well, we had a case...

11:08.990 --> 11:15.296
not too long ago, out in Colorado, where this was several years ago, six, seven years ago, actually.

11:15.316 --> 11:18.959
A motorcycle gang was going to take over a small town out there.

11:18.979 --> 11:29.710
And the word got around if they were going to, so eight or 10 of these fellows with their rifles and pistols went out to see them and suggested that unless they wanted to be buried on the spot, they should keep on going.

11:29.750 --> 11:33.553
This is the type of thing that we're talking about.

11:34.274 --> 11:34.414
Yeah.

11:34.434 --> 11:37.697
Obviously, you write tremendously entertaining books.

11:40.175 --> 11:43.699
audience that is beyond calculation.

11:43.719 --> 11:48.384
Are you writing basically for entertainment or is there a hidden purpose here?

11:48.704 --> 11:50.947
No, I'm writing for entertainment.

11:50.967 --> 11:51.728
I'm a storyteller.

11:52.569 --> 11:54.451
First, last of the moment, I'm a storyteller.

11:55.131 --> 12:01.498
I think that anybody writes for a purpose or sell a bill of goods is making a mistake.

12:01.518 --> 12:06.484
And we have talked, there's been a lot of talk recently about the decline of the novel and where are the novelists going.

12:06.504 --> 12:09.287
The novelists are going down the drain because they've forgotten their storyteller.

12:09.790 --> 12:14.616
They're trying to write political facts or advance some philosophical argument.

12:15.998 --> 12:19.623
What a writer should do is write a good, entertaining story.

12:20.023 --> 12:23.208
There is no way to keep what you believe out of the story.

12:23.989 --> 12:26.071
It's going to come in there, but it's going to come in naturally.

12:26.812 --> 12:37.466
It's going to come in naturally and easily, and if you try to direct it or make propaganda out of it, you're going to fail in both ways, both with propaganda and with an entertaining story.

12:38.147 --> 12:39.409
The thing to do is tell your story.

12:39.777 --> 12:40.858
What do you believe will come out?

12:40.878 --> 12:46.145
Obviously you're trying to set the record straight, though, on this particular period.

12:46.165 --> 12:50.870
Yes, I'm trying to do that, and I'm trying to pass history on.

12:52.232 --> 12:56.377
See, there are millions of people out there who don't have the chance to do the research that I do.

12:56.978 --> 12:58.279
They're curious about the stories.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.541
They'd like to know the stories.

12:59.861 --> 13:02.405
They'd like to hear them, but they don't have a chance.

13:02.465 --> 13:04.908
I don't know how to order a date for it, but I do.

13:04.928 --> 13:09.413
I'm on the business side of this, so I go get the stories, and I tell them

13:10.338 --> 13:22.253
You've, according to the things I've read, you've had an unbelievable number of different lives, professions, jobs.

13:22.814 --> 13:25.898
Well, I left home and I had to make a living.

13:25.918 --> 13:26.960
And it was a very rough time.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.162
That's right.

13:29.423 --> 13:30.744
How old are you now?

13:30.965 --> 13:33.007
I don't mention, don't tell anybody.

13:33.408 --> 13:34.349
I've been around for years.

13:34.369 --> 13:36.071
I was in World War II, so that gives you an idea.

13:36.632 --> 13:38.134
But I don't for philosophical reasons.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.382
I just don't believe anybody should ever tell their age, or any time.

13:41.542 --> 13:42.784
Why is that?

13:42.804 --> 13:44.346
Because it's the wrong way to judge people.

13:45.988 --> 13:46.108
Okay.

13:46.148 --> 13:50.654
Winston Churchill, if he died when he was 60, he'd have been a footnote in English history.

13:51.795 --> 13:57.623
And on the other hand, William Pitt was Chancellor of England when he was in his 20s.

13:57.643 --> 14:00.987
Napoleon had won his greatest Italian campaign when he was 26 years old.

14:01.568 --> 14:02.609
He was through when he was 40.

14:03.991 --> 14:06.274
And Stephen Crane died when he was 29, too.

14:06.294 --> 14:07.075
Of course.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.065
Of course, you can't, there's no way of judging a man at all.

14:11.686 --> 14:13.749
And I think age should be left out of consideration.

14:14.450 --> 14:15.352
That's a good point.

14:15.372 --> 14:22.202
But anyway, you were making a point, too, about the various endeavors and how they all came back.

14:22.303 --> 14:24.085
I had to make a living.

14:24.105 --> 14:25.207
I was 15 years old.

14:25.287 --> 14:26.529
I was as tall as I am now.

14:26.549 --> 14:29.874
I weighed 155, 160 pounds while I left home.

14:30.736 --> 14:34.902
And I passed as 22.

14:36.113 --> 14:37.876
for the first few years, and then I passed to 24.

14:37.936 --> 14:39.258
Wow.

14:40.119 --> 14:41.040
Until I was 24.

14:42.342 --> 14:45.006
But so consequently, you're asking ages.

14:45.026 --> 14:49.894
A lot of people come up and say, I'm this old, that old, and they're judging, but they knew in the past.

14:49.914 --> 14:50.975
And the ages are all wrong.

14:51.576 --> 14:58.366
But anyway, the jobs that I got were the jobs that were available at the time.

14:59.268 --> 15:00.569
And I've only mentioned a few of them.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.315
Those first few years were very, very rough.

15:04.767 --> 15:06.209
You were on your own, too, I mean.

15:06.249 --> 15:07.150
I was on my own.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.171
It was bad times.

15:08.271 --> 15:09.312
I missed a lot of meals.

15:10.033 --> 15:11.354
I was hungry a lot.

15:11.374 --> 15:13.736
I slept in... Are you still around North Dakota?

15:13.756 --> 15:14.497
No, no.

15:14.517 --> 15:17.761
I left North Dakota, and my first job, I believe in there, was in Texas.

15:18.642 --> 15:20.484
Skinning dead cattle out in the Panhandle.

15:20.504 --> 15:31.235
Cattle had been dead for a while because we could save their hides, and the fellow I was working with was doing that.

15:31.255 --> 15:33.357
He was a man who'd been raised as an Indian.

15:33.623 --> 15:36.327
Is this about where the appreciation for this?

15:37.068 --> 15:39.451
No, I appreciate it long before that.

15:40.092 --> 15:51.688
I wanted to tell stories at the time I was big enough to walk, and my great-grandfather was killing the scalp of the Indians, and I grew up on Indian stories, and stories of fighting and the frontier.

15:52.609 --> 16:02.382
I had a brother who was on the Mexican border down in 1916, that border from Mexican Scare, Pancho Villa, and whatnot was around.

16:03.543 --> 16:09.792
So I acquired an awful lot of background that really intended to.

16:09.812 --> 16:11.094
I intended to write about other things.

16:11.114 --> 16:13.197
I was going to write, but not about the West.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.782
I knew it, and it was really too close to home.

16:16.802 --> 16:20.888
And at the time, I was thinking about other things.

16:21.970 --> 16:23.933
Some of the first stuff I wrote was about boxing.

16:23.953 --> 16:25.135
I used to fight a little bit.

16:25.155 --> 16:25.896
I read that.

16:25.996 --> 16:26.737
11 fights?

16:27.077 --> 16:29.601
No, I had 59 fights, and I lost five.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.859
What weight class?

16:31.879 --> 16:35.123
I started as a middleweight and what most of my classes lie heavyweight.

16:35.143 --> 16:36.804
Was it at least professional place?

16:36.965 --> 16:37.545
Yes.

16:37.565 --> 16:39.988
Did you go on to Louis L'Amour?

16:40.008 --> 16:40.869
I had other names.

16:41.109 --> 16:44.612
Did you give me a couple of them?

16:44.632 --> 16:44.692
No.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.335
Gotta get a scoop here someplace.

16:48.376 --> 16:51.279
No, because in the first place, none of them became well known.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.621
Nobody knew how I was.

16:54.162 --> 16:56.404
In those days, people think there's boxing now.

16:56.424 --> 16:57.225
Where were you fighting?

16:57.245 --> 16:58.186
What states?

16:58.206 --> 17:00.128
All over the states and some abroad.

17:00.749 --> 17:05.235
I fought my toughest, longest fight was fought over the Battle for Bamborneo.

17:05.255 --> 17:06.497
Were you good?

17:06.918 --> 17:08.700
Yes, if you don't mind my saying.

17:08.740 --> 17:09.361
So I was.

17:10.603 --> 17:12.566
The only fights I lost, I wasn't eating regularly.

17:13.968 --> 17:15.790
And I took them to make them money.

17:16.752 --> 17:19.736
What does it take to be a good fighter?

17:19.756 --> 17:21.318
It's beyond the obvious.

17:21.338 --> 17:22.500
First place, you've got to be hungry.

17:23.922 --> 17:25.364
You've got to want to win.

17:25.384 --> 17:26.866
You've got to want to win very badly.

17:27.567 --> 17:30.351
And I was hungry and I wanted to win.

17:31.073 --> 17:34.697
And then I had been boxing since I was almost big enough to walk.

17:35.939 --> 17:37.521
My father had boxed some.

17:37.561 --> 17:39.243
I had two older brothers who had boxed some.

17:40.004 --> 17:43.468
And when I began to manifest an interest in it, my dad took me down to St.

17:43.488 --> 17:44.309
Paul, Minnesota.

17:45.150 --> 17:50.737
And for two or three times a week, for six months, I was in the gymnasium with Mike Gibbons.

17:51.639 --> 17:54.802
Mike was called the unproud middleweight champion of the world.

17:54.822 --> 17:59.308
His brother Tommy fought Dempsey and Tony and Carpentier and all those people.

17:59.828 --> 18:06.795
I had learned from him, so the time I fought my first professional fight, I had a skill beyond the average amateur.

18:08.696 --> 18:15.323
Although, some of the first fights I fought were just pick up fights around the country.

18:15.343 --> 18:25.352
I'd go to a small town, be working there, and they'd have some local guy who thought he was a fighter, and they'd arrange a fight, and sometimes one or take all, usually.

18:25.372 --> 18:28.315
This is basically what we call club fighting today.

18:28.335 --> 18:29.616
Something similar, yeah.

18:30.203 --> 18:33.027
Did you ever think that you could go at it?

18:33.488 --> 18:35.630
I thought very seriously about it one time.

18:36.131 --> 18:44.302
I thought very seriously at one time, and there's one difficulty with being a fighter, which you see shown all the time.

18:45.003 --> 18:49.429
A fighter who is really a fighter never believes he can't win.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.833
That's the trouble with Muhammad Ali.

18:51.853 --> 18:52.954
Well, he keeps coming back.

18:53.795 --> 18:56.900
You can't get the idea out of your head that you can't win.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.383
That's right.

19:00.629 --> 19:02.892
But of course, in the days I'm talking about, there were fighters.

19:03.653 --> 19:04.874
Not like these guys now.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.056
Do you have any favorites?

19:06.076 --> 19:08.078
Do you still follow boxing?

19:08.158 --> 19:08.959
I follow boxing.

19:08.979 --> 19:12.984
I don't think any of these guys can fight now.

19:13.004 --> 19:13.885
For several reasons.

19:14.226 --> 19:16.008
There aren't enough fighters.

19:17.349 --> 19:18.571
You don't get enough experience.

19:19.672 --> 19:22.836
See, in the times I'm talking, take Los Angeles, for example, just as an example.

19:22.856 --> 19:26.060
I'm not rambling on this for a purpose.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.265
I'm wondering what you bring, what lessons you learn as a writer from this kind of

19:30.498 --> 19:35.503
Well, I learned, I'll sidetrack myself here just for a minute.

19:35.884 --> 19:41.510
To say the major lesson I learned from fighting was to get up after you get knocked down and keep on fighting because you win.

19:41.530 --> 19:42.931
And that's what a rider has to do.

19:43.231 --> 19:46.755
You get a lot of rejections, you still keep getting up, eventually you win.

19:46.775 --> 19:55.925
But in those days, for example, in Los Angeles, there's one club in Los Angeles now holding fights every week.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.026
In those days it was six.

19:58.608 --> 20:00.049
And in this area,

20:00.738 --> 20:02.520
There were some clubs going all the time.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.124
In New York, there must have been 100 open fights.

20:06.585 --> 20:11.951
You'd go into a gymnasium in those days, and then they all were 70 or 80 fighters before working out.

20:11.971 --> 20:19.739
To get anywhere, you had to fight anywhere from 60 to 80 fights where you got a chance to get a shot at the championship, and you were the best.

20:19.980 --> 20:29.310
I knocked out 34 when I fought.

20:30.387 --> 20:38.098
And I could go pretty good.

20:39.961 --> 20:43.205
But I wanted to write more than anything else in the world.

20:43.966 --> 20:49.695
And then right at the critical time when I might have settled down to serious fighting, there wasn't any money in the boxing game.

20:49.875 --> 20:50.776
The money went out of it.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.560
The MC had gone out, you know, and

20:53.759 --> 20:59.164
There wasn't a pocket or heavyweight champion or not, and usually boxing is a good deal by the heavyweight champion.

20:59.604 --> 21:02.507
If you have a good active champion, the rest of the divisions are active too.

21:03.588 --> 21:05.230
It's changed a little bit now.

21:05.470 --> 21:08.533
Oh, now it's changed because you have the great television.

21:09.214 --> 21:10.515
You can make an enormous lot of money.

21:11.115 --> 21:12.316
Your first book was what?

21:13.377 --> 21:16.741
Well, my first book is quite a story about that.

21:17.181 --> 21:22.286
I usually tell people my first book was published in 1953, written in 1952.

21:22.346 --> 21:23.547
It isn't really true.

21:23.948 --> 21:25.530
Our first book was written in 1950.

21:26.471 --> 21:29.213
It was published in England, of all places.

21:29.294 --> 21:31.436
I never saw a copy of it for 16 years.

21:31.636 --> 21:32.737
Okay, what was the title?

21:33.057 --> 21:33.878
Westward the Tide.

21:34.519 --> 21:39.624
It's since been published with Adam.

21:39.644 --> 21:39.965
It's a new list.

21:39.985 --> 21:48.393
And when did you know that, to use a baseball phrase, a pitcher, they say you can bring it when you deliver the fastball.

21:48.413 --> 21:53.078
When did you know that you could bring it, that you were a major league quality in that,

21:54.526 --> 21:57.290
Well, that's difficult to say.

21:57.310 --> 22:01.857
I knew right in the very start that I was going to make it.

22:01.877 --> 22:05.983
My mother asked me one time, after I repeated failures, what if you don't?

22:06.323 --> 22:09.287
And I couldn't make the idea real for myself.

22:09.307 --> 22:10.870
I was always sure that I was going to.

22:11.391 --> 22:14.094
But the point was, I wrote a lot of short stories first.

22:15.276 --> 22:19.302
But... No, they were mostly about the Far East.

22:20.108 --> 22:22.390
about China and Indonesia and the area.

22:22.451 --> 22:24.433
That's the places you visited also.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.375
You were a seaman there too, right?

22:26.395 --> 22:26.715
That's right.

22:27.476 --> 22:28.597
I knocked around a good deal.

22:28.677 --> 22:31.901
I spent a year in Indonesia.

22:32.962 --> 22:36.145
There was East Indies there.

22:36.225 --> 22:42.192
I was trying to write it and finally it began to sell.

22:43.573 --> 22:48.799
It wasn't until after World War.

22:49.302 --> 22:51.445
World War II that I really got going.

22:52.126 --> 22:53.668
So I'd sold some stories before that.

22:54.309 --> 22:58.095
You do, what, three novels a year or about that?

22:58.115 --> 23:00.358
I mean, what's the current total?

23:01.420 --> 23:04.244
How many titles?

23:04.264 --> 23:05.325
70, 70, something?

23:05.345 --> 23:07.048
No, it's over 80 now.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.051
Over 80.

23:09.191 --> 23:09.732
Yeah.

23:10.713 --> 23:12.676
Do you ever go back and read these books?

23:12.696 --> 23:14.078
Oh, yes, occasionally I do.

23:14.098 --> 23:15.580
I didn't for a long time, but

23:15.762 --> 23:19.727
Every once in a while, somebody will ask me some question, but I forgot, so I have to go back and read it.

23:20.147 --> 23:24.012
Is there ever a fear that you're going to be covering the same territory?

23:24.152 --> 23:28.518
I never even think about it, because there's too much territory I haven't touched to cover.

23:29.339 --> 23:36.308
No problem about, this is a silly question you've asked, but writer's block, obviously, is not your vocabulary.

23:37.269 --> 23:44.638
I personally think, now a lot of writers would argue with me about this, I personally think that writer's block is a totally unnecessary thing.

23:45.867 --> 23:48.411
I think the way to get rid of writer's block is to write through it.

23:50.114 --> 23:53.280
If you get writer's block, start writing about anything.

23:54.743 --> 23:56.626
You don't get water until you turn the faucet on.

23:57.768 --> 24:00.412
And you don't get ideas until you start writing.

24:00.553 --> 24:02.957
If you use a typewriter or pen, just start doing it.

24:03.418 --> 24:09.188
If you can't write about what you want to write about, start describing one of Cleopatra's afternoons or something.

24:10.170 --> 24:11.031
And just start writing.

24:12.007 --> 24:14.290
and all of a sudden the ideas start to generate.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.353
How many do you have going at the same time?

24:18.315 --> 24:25.384
Well, I'm usually writing one, sometimes two, and I am doing research on three or four more.

24:25.404 --> 24:29.109
But in terms of actually writing, you're only working on one at the same time?

24:29.249 --> 24:29.930
No, usually two.

24:30.431 --> 24:31.993
Do you have two typewriters going?

24:32.013 --> 24:32.994
Yes.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.798
I have two typewriters, and I switch sometimes at lunchtime.

24:36.719 --> 24:38.942
Sometimes I may go several days without writing one at the same time.

24:42.888 --> 24:46.093
seven days a week.

24:46.113 --> 24:48.416
What do you do with kicks?

24:48.476 --> 24:49.618
Well, am I right?

24:50.119 --> 24:50.820
I love to write.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.943
You see, I'd rather do it than anything else.

24:53.323 --> 24:55.126
Oh, I take time off whenever I want to.

24:55.146 --> 24:55.907
Are you obsessive when it comes to it?

24:55.927 --> 24:55.987
No.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.351
Oh, I take time off whenever I want to.

24:58.411 --> 25:00.734
My wife and kids want to go someplace to do something.

25:02.377 --> 25:08.285
Unless I'm really into the deadline or something, or I'm in a big hurry, or the story's real hot.

25:08.305 --> 25:10.228
Then I'll stay with it.

25:11.272 --> 25:15.738
Sometimes I pick up a book to Colorado, where I like the Ike and the Mom.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.460
And I have a typewriter up there, too.

25:18.581 --> 25:21.084
You introduced the Sackett family.

25:21.104 --> 25:21.425
Yes.

25:23.828 --> 25:25.490
What prompted this decision?

25:25.510 --> 25:28.533
I think you projected for 40 novels in this particular film?

25:28.553 --> 25:29.615
Well, not only the Sacketts.

25:30.095 --> 25:34.180
In the Three Families series, the Sacketts, Chantry, and Talam families.

25:35.542 --> 25:38.005
I started those three families in

25:38.305 --> 25:44.293
Through their eyes, I'm gonna tell the story of the opening up of the American frontier, the United States and Canada.

25:45.735 --> 25:48.699
And this was partly prompted.

25:48.719 --> 25:53.465
I had written a couple of the Sackett stories first, just for the idea of writing stories.

25:54.286 --> 25:57.391
Although I became very intrigued in the Sackett family, and a lot of my readers did.

25:58.432 --> 26:06.743
But, well, the idea generated, my wife and I had been married,

26:07.398 --> 26:17.168
One day she brought home from her home, from her former home, some books that she had, and one of them was a family history, part of her family.

26:18.009 --> 26:26.558
So glancing through it, I got to comparing notes and found out that her family and mine must have known each other several times over the past 200 years.

26:27.619 --> 26:31.583
And I decided that was true of us, it must be true of a lot of other people.

26:31.603 --> 26:34.806
So I decided to write these three families

26:35.258 --> 26:38.943
and have them brush elbows a number of times in the past, and finally intermarry.

26:39.804 --> 26:42.308
It kind of gives you a little credibility here.

26:42.328 --> 26:43.289
That's right.

26:43.309 --> 26:47.314
Do you alternate, say, between one of these other reasons and something else?

26:47.334 --> 26:48.176
Yes.

26:48.196 --> 26:50.319
I've written more of the Sackett stories now than the others.

26:51.260 --> 26:54.024
And I started the series in the middle, unfortunately.

26:54.725 --> 26:59.511
I started the stories in the 1860s with the Sacketts.

27:00.284 --> 27:07.952
Part of the idea was generated also by letters I got asking about the pioneers and how they got that way.

27:08.072 --> 27:13.497
You're said to know as much about the Indians as anyone, right?

27:13.778 --> 27:17.021
Is that a fair statement?

27:17.181 --> 27:19.043
I think, generally speaking, it's true.

27:19.544 --> 27:29.734
I think there are people around in no specific tribes better than I do, but not all the Indians better than I do.

27:30.035 --> 27:31.297
Believe me, I'm still learning.

27:32.098 --> 27:35.563
I don't know the 50th of what I want to learn.

27:35.783 --> 27:43.514
I've been aware of the last 10 or 12 years of what a rotten break they've had.

27:43.894 --> 27:45.416
Bad ain't the works.

27:46.398 --> 27:49.382
We Americans are masochistic in that respect.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.144
We like to punish ourselves.

27:52.246 --> 27:55.350
We like to beat ourselves with a stick.

27:56.039 --> 28:00.143
We did nothing here that wasn't done all around the world and hasn't been done from the beginning of time.

28:01.425 --> 28:10.775
After all, the Picts were in England, and then the Celtics came in, and then the Saxons came in, and then the Normans came in, and each one took over from the other.

28:10.795 --> 28:13.758
Nobody cried a single tear about them all.

28:13.778 --> 28:15.540
This is back from a hundred years ago, too.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.983
Yeah, well, it's the same thing that happened all around the world.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.785
What happened here was the same thing.

28:20.245 --> 28:22.688
It just happened, and Indians took land away from other Indians.

28:23.663 --> 28:29.110
The concept then of the noble savage, you say that's a little stereotypical too.

28:30.412 --> 28:30.752
It is.

28:31.654 --> 28:31.914
It is.

28:32.515 --> 28:35.218
With the Indian, they were good and bad on both sides.

28:36.060 --> 28:37.301
It was a two-way street.

28:38.443 --> 28:42.308
There were a lot of noble savages, but they were only noble at certain times.

28:42.768 --> 28:44.911
They were very un-noble at other times.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.194
And the same thing with white men.

28:48.316 --> 28:48.756
They're people.

28:48.817 --> 28:50.118
They're people.

28:50.138 --> 28:52.962
And when you talk about Indians, it's like saying Europeans.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.003
because there's vast differences between different tribes.

28:57.504 --> 28:59.726
And they have different ways of thinking, different ideas.

29:00.287 --> 29:02.489
The Plains tribes think somewhat similar.

29:03.751 --> 29:04.692
But it's a different mythology.

29:04.712 --> 29:14.382
So when you write about Indians, you write about them with sympathy, perhaps, but you temper that with... I tell the truth.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.344
I feel sympathetic to them, yes.

29:17.004 --> 29:20.468
But they were here, and they had this land.

29:21.241 --> 29:25.567
And you see, a whole lot of the stereotypes about the white man and the Indian are entirely wrong.

29:26.248 --> 29:31.936
For example, when the white men first began coming to this country, the Indians despised them.

29:32.216 --> 29:36.602
As with anyone coming to camp out of my backyard.

29:37.644 --> 29:38.204
That's right.

29:38.505 --> 29:40.047
But it wasn't only that.

29:40.868 --> 29:44.112
But the first thing the white men wanted who came here was furs.

29:45.534 --> 29:49.059
Well, to an Indian, if he's any kind of a man, what did he trap his own furs?

29:49.360 --> 29:49.900
What's the matter?

29:49.920 --> 29:50.421
Is he a woman?

29:51.194 --> 29:53.136
You know, and they kind of sneered at them.

29:53.897 --> 29:57.121
And the first, when the first traders went up the Missouri River, met the Sioux.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.265
The Sioux were very, very arrogant.

30:00.285 --> 30:05.852
And they just pushed white men out of the way and paid no attention to them at all, you know.

30:05.872 --> 30:06.973
They were nothing.

30:06.993 --> 30:09.216
There was a journey of defeat.

30:09.236 --> 30:18.147
And gradually, however, a situation developed where the Indian wanted a lot of things that only the white man had.

30:19.291 --> 30:21.975
There were two ways to get it, one by trade and one by war.

30:23.037 --> 30:25.320
And they used both methods.

30:25.340 --> 30:33.031
Would you, now you're a man of the 20th century, but obviously you're like devoted to recreating the Vatican.

30:35.255 --> 30:36.617
Switch the magic of it.

30:36.637 --> 30:41.123
Would you like to go back and... No, I'd rather live now than any other time in the world's history.

30:41.484 --> 30:43.807
This is the great period.

30:43.907 --> 30:47.813
Everything else that's happened in the world is just preliminary to what's happening now.

30:49.008 --> 31:13.665
Because now we're going to take off into space the greatest frontier of all of us the frontier that's endless I May write about it and I wouldn't want to go out there yet a little bit later when science fiction Yes, it has in fact I thought seriously about writing something and I was one of the first readers of science fiction

31:14.118 --> 31:19.124
Ray Bradbury and I often compare notes because we both started reading some of the same stuff at the same time.

31:19.404 --> 31:19.805
Like what?

31:20.626 --> 31:24.750
Hugo Gernsback was the man who really originated science fiction.

31:24.770 --> 31:26.673
I mean, there were science fiction stories before.

31:27.774 --> 31:34.041
Cyrano de Bergerac, not the fictional character, but the one he's based on, the real one, was a marvelous swordsman.

31:34.061 --> 31:36.924
He wrote a story about a voice of the moon.

31:36.944 --> 31:40.589
And a couple were written back in the time of the ancient Greeks.

31:40.609 --> 31:41.830
So it's not a new idea.

31:42.012 --> 31:46.237
But science fiction as a real genre begin with Hugo Gernsback.

31:46.758 --> 31:51.042
He started a magazine many years ago called Science and Invention.

31:52.144 --> 32:01.034
And he published stories, something that Science Digest does now, which were about new scientific developments, but for the popular market.

32:02.055 --> 32:04.939
And he wrote about extraordinary happenings and whatnot.

32:04.959 --> 32:07.041
And he publicized some of the Lowell

32:07.460 --> 32:20.953
ideas about canals on Mars and that sort of thing and about the same time he began publishing a short story or two of science fiction in this magazine and From that on it became very very popular.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.234
So he started amazing stories.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.558
Have you ever attempted to write outside of your field?

32:26.098 --> 32:37.129
Well, I've written I mean other than the stories that you mentioned earlier No, but I've written sports stories and detective stories and everything

32:37.362 --> 32:38.563
possible kind of story you can imagine.

32:39.144 --> 32:40.926
You say there's so much you have to write.

32:40.946 --> 32:41.647
You want to write?

32:42.188 --> 32:42.508
Yes.

32:43.189 --> 32:44.330
I forget the number of titles.

32:44.370 --> 32:47.774
You're pushing 80 or you... I have 84 or 5.

32:47.814 --> 32:48.455
I forgot most.

32:48.475 --> 32:49.736
That number.

32:50.537 --> 32:58.446
What are the areas that are... We're talking about how many years, I mean, actual years, do you focus on?

32:58.546 --> 32:59.808
Is it a 20-year period?

32:59.928 --> 33:02.251
What's the golden age of the American West?

33:02.511 --> 33:04.213
Oh, I don't focus on one particular period.

33:04.953 --> 33:10.079
The golden age of the American West is probably 1860 to 1900, but I don't focus on it.

33:10.219 --> 33:30.942
I have stories in- They go back to 1600 and 1500 and something, and I've also written a, I haven't published it yet, but 15 years ago I wrote a historical novel of the 12th century, which my publisher wanted me to put aside because it thought it would interfere with the Western.

33:30.982 --> 33:32.384
And- Except where?

33:33.525 --> 33:34.386
In Europe and Asia.

33:34.653 --> 33:35.714
I re-read it the other day.

33:35.734 --> 33:37.957
It's a damn good book.

33:38.177 --> 33:41.580
I'm going to publish it.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.705
When are you guys going to bring it out?

33:45.785 --> 33:48.107
Watch your mailbox.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.269
I'm going to write other things.

33:49.329 --> 34:00.541
For example, in the Three Families series, one of my stories is concerned with a man named Chantry.

34:00.561 --> 34:02.803
He's one of the families.

34:03.256 --> 34:05.178
It starts in a book called Fair Blows the Wind.

34:06.499 --> 34:08.301
I'm gonna write a sequel to that very soon.

34:09.241 --> 34:16.308
This book takes place, it starts on the coast of Carolina and flashes back to even in Shakespeare's time.

34:16.328 --> 34:21.673
And I'm gonna do a sequel to that pretty quick because I deliberately left some threads hanging to pick up later.

34:22.213 --> 34:24.595
How long does it take you to write a book?

34:25.316 --> 34:30.140
No way to answer that because sometimes I'm thinking about them for months or years for a writer.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.082
But the actual writing process.

34:32.483 --> 34:33.504
I write three books a year.

34:35.225 --> 34:37.267
Do you do a lot of revision?

34:37.407 --> 34:39.229
I do no revision at all.

34:39.249 --> 34:40.871
One time through the typewriter and that's it?

34:40.891 --> 34:46.315
One time through the typewriter and then correct the typos and a few things like that.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.356
That's it.

34:48.617 --> 34:50.319
I do a lot of thinking beforehand, however.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.721
Not thinking the story.

34:52.781 --> 34:54.262
I never have my ending in sight.

34:55.263 --> 34:55.884
I won't say never.

34:56.144 --> 34:57.025
Once or twice I have.

34:57.726 --> 34:59.327
But usually I do not have.

34:59.867 --> 35:00.448
But...

35:01.154 --> 35:06.601
I have the general trend of the story and where it's going to take place and the kind of characters I'm going to deal with.

35:06.701 --> 35:08.704
You start with what?

35:08.724 --> 35:10.967
A character, a subject, an idea?

35:10.987 --> 35:12.809
I start with a situation and a couple of characters.

35:15.152 --> 35:17.295
And take it on from there.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.119
Hondo, for example.

35:20.139 --> 35:25.205
A man who is fiercely independent, even to the point where even his dog is independent.

35:25.225 --> 35:26.787
A woman asks him to feed his dog.

35:26.807 --> 35:28.309
He's not my dog, he's his own dog.

35:28.850 --> 35:29.811
He just travels with me.

35:30.787 --> 35:38.058
And a woman who wanted a home above everything, and she has a very miserable home, she's going to cling to it regardless.

35:38.338 --> 35:43.326
And an Indian chief was leading his men and the people in the war who can't win.

35:44.167 --> 35:45.829
He knows he can't win.

35:45.849 --> 35:53.701
And I take these three people and put them in an Indian outbreak that actually happened, and tell the story of what happened to them.

35:53.721 --> 35:57.807
Now, most of the stories, not all, but most of the stories we hear

35:59.390 --> 36:01.032
focus on frontier men.

36:01.572 --> 36:02.794
How about frontier women?

36:02.814 --> 36:08.280
Is this another subject that you feel needs... The New Cherokee Trail isn't exactly that.

36:08.701 --> 36:12.064
The Cherokee Trail, the book that's out now, is the leading character is a woman.

36:13.306 --> 36:15.588
And I've had strong women in many of my stories.

36:16.950 --> 36:22.416
And they played a very important part in the West, and their story is women could be told.

36:22.897 --> 36:27.101
Do you have trouble writing, creating female characters?

36:27.121 --> 36:27.642
I like women.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.327
It's easy to write about.

36:29.347 --> 36:35.436
I mean, that's not a... I've asked that to a number of lawyers.

36:35.476 --> 36:41.465
Somebody will admit, like Peter Benchley was, just finally did a book of a woman that he focused on young girls.

36:41.485 --> 36:48.635
He said, I'd better start off with a young girl before I grew up into mature women.

36:48.655 --> 36:50.879
Well, I don't think I have any trouble with it.

36:51.740 --> 36:57.308
I've written about good women and bad women, and there's a woman who's very...

36:57.575 --> 37:00.438
evil, you might say.

37:00.458 --> 37:07.545
One of my interesting women, I think, is Christina in The Burning Hills.

37:08.506 --> 37:12.530
She's a Mexican girl who's living in a sheep ranch down the Mexican border.

37:12.731 --> 37:18.917
She's married unhappily and has come back to try and help her people in the sheep ranch.

37:22.260 --> 37:24.763
Geraldine Page played the woman in Hondo

37:25.790 --> 37:30.517
I haven't seemed to find enough depth of courage there to do something with it.

37:30.537 --> 37:33.001
35, I think, is the number of yours.

37:33.021 --> 37:33.581
Right around there.

37:34.002 --> 37:34.923
They made movies, yeah.

37:34.944 --> 37:36.806
They made movies.

37:36.826 --> 37:38.809
Have you ever done original screenplays?

37:38.969 --> 37:40.872
You always like to do a book for it.

37:40.892 --> 37:41.874
I like to do the book.

37:42.194 --> 37:45.759
I never done an original screenplay except for television.

37:45.779 --> 37:48.524
I mean, just to see whether I can do it or not.

37:48.544 --> 37:50.366
I've forgotten the story.

37:50.386 --> 37:53.130
I'd have to come back and check if there wasn't any of any points.

37:53.992 --> 37:54.953
I had 65.

38:02.020 --> 38:07.388
How about the general image that we get from the movies?

38:08.770 --> 38:12.515
Are the best stories accepted from the get of that?

38:13.556 --> 38:16.581
Most of them are partly true, but they're overdrawn.

38:16.601 --> 38:20.706
A lot of them are written by people who know nothing about the West.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.812
My favorite in recent years was Jeremiah Johnson.

38:24.892 --> 38:27.035
That was a superb painter.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.778
And he did something there.

38:28.798 --> 38:31.842
I've been trying to get producers and directors to do for years.

38:32.159 --> 38:36.604
He lingered a little bit over things, didn't try to hurry through it too fast.

38:36.624 --> 38:40.028
You lose a lot of the flavor in the West, you do that.

38:40.688 --> 38:53.502
I'd like to, in the process of telling the West and showing, show what was happening and just see the people working, for example, and not just moving places to shoot.

38:53.923 --> 38:59.449
I mentioned in one square, there are 25 million

39:00.087 --> 39:02.411
Yes, I do.

39:02.651 --> 39:09.902
I figure there's about 25 million out there who haven't read me.

39:10.503 --> 39:11.745
How many do you figure have read you?

39:12.706 --> 39:13.407
Oh, I don't know.

39:13.547 --> 39:15.270
Several hundred million or several million.

39:15.991 --> 39:16.512
I don't know.

39:16.552 --> 39:20.318
Some people think that at least three people read every one of my books.

39:21.059 --> 39:21.880
Some say five.

39:24.624 --> 39:26.567
I was talking to people yesterday who said that

39:29.146 --> 39:33.150
This fellow and his wife and his two daughters read my books and then passed them on to other people.

39:33.711 --> 39:34.632
That often happens.

39:34.852 --> 39:37.435
But the $25 million, you want to get it.

39:37.635 --> 39:39.217
I want to get it.

39:39.237 --> 39:39.598
Why is that?

39:39.618 --> 39:42.761
I mean, you're the best-selling author of America.

39:43.262 --> 39:45.985
Nobody ever sells enough.

39:46.105 --> 39:52.752
And it's obviously not for the monetary consideration, it's for the consideration of revenue.

39:52.832 --> 39:55.255
No, the monetary consideration is there, very definitely.

39:56.011 --> 40:07.204
I'm not gonna brush that away, but I also want them to read because they can learn a lot about their country and about the people and what happened here.

40:07.665 --> 40:13.893
You know, in the past few years, we've had a very bad press in this country and everybody's been sneering at everything American.

40:14.113 --> 40:16.295
Americans have been sneering, nobody else has.

40:16.315 --> 40:21.402
We've been doing the sneering ourselves and putting America down in so many ways.

40:21.422 --> 40:23.724
I think it's all nonsense, it shouldn't happen.

40:23.744 --> 40:25.967
And also, you have no idea

40:26.605 --> 40:30.269
how little people nowadays know about their own history.

40:30.289 --> 40:32.711
And people will say things that are not contradicted at all.

40:33.071 --> 40:42.141
For example, I heard a man not too long ago on television saying, and nobody, there were a couple men on the program with him, and they didn't raise a hand or try to contradict him.

40:42.821 --> 40:50.849
He said that the revolution was all made by people who did it for their own joy, their own purpose, and had everything to gain, nothing to lose.

40:51.270 --> 40:53.652
George Washington was the wealthiest man in the colonies.

40:53.672 --> 40:54.553
He had everything to lose.

40:55.613 --> 41:00.801
not only his life, but everything he owned, for his family.

41:00.821 --> 41:05.248
A great many of the rest of those people were very well above all and could have lost everything.

41:05.969 --> 41:07.131
But they gambled win-win.

41:08.092 --> 41:12.940
And there are so many stories being told around about American history that are not true.

41:14.282 --> 41:18.669
When you come through a city like Boston, you don't make many trips here.

41:18.769 --> 41:18.989
No.

41:19.029 --> 41:22.314
There's probably one, isn't there?

41:22.334 --> 41:23.376
I was here in 75.

41:24.689 --> 41:30.655
Is this part of an attempt to go after some fragment of that 45 million?

41:30.775 --> 41:31.236
Oh, sure.

41:31.837 --> 41:35.100
Is this one of your least developed areas, would you say?

41:35.140 --> 41:38.544
Well, let's say it needs more development.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.326
Let's put it that way.

41:41.487 --> 41:44.109
Because I get a lot of fan mail up here.

41:44.129 --> 41:51.938
And I was on a call-in show last night, and a lot of people called in who read all my books.

41:52.118 --> 41:54.240
No, I would like to do that, but also,

41:54.625 --> 41:58.011
I'm going to write about this period, this area.

41:58.451 --> 42:02.578
A four-year path that I mentioned is the only book I've touched on so far, but I'm going to do more.

42:03.239 --> 42:04.681
Some of my family came from that.

42:04.701 --> 42:06.384
Kind of like a scouting mission as well.

42:06.544 --> 42:06.945
That's right.

42:07.566 --> 42:08.327
And buying books.

42:08.928 --> 42:09.669
I bought a lot of books.

42:11.893 --> 42:14.297
On this trip entirely, I guess I bought over 100 books.

42:15.419 --> 42:20.447
You know, there was a book, a famous book, What Makes Louie Lamour Right?

42:23.144 --> 42:24.986
I have to recite the figures again.

42:25.086 --> 42:26.147
Yes, I like to tell stories.

42:27.589 --> 42:29.050
That's the whole thing.

42:29.070 --> 42:33.555
I love to tell stories, and I better write than anything else I can think of.

42:33.575 --> 42:36.378
Some people like to ski, some people like to go boating, I like to write.

42:38.781 --> 42:41.744
Would you say you've grown as a writer?

42:41.804 --> 42:48.391
I mean, when you look at number 80, do you think it's infinitely better than number 15 or 20?

42:48.571 --> 42:50.113
Not infinitely better.

42:50.768 --> 42:51.729
Better in some way.

42:51.749 --> 42:53.751
But incrementally better, perhaps.

42:54.692 --> 42:56.254
Yes.

42:56.274 --> 42:57.935
What I think happens is this.

42:58.056 --> 43:00.498
My books are at least different from each other.

43:01.479 --> 43:06.945
And there's been a steady growth.

43:06.965 --> 43:12.951
Sometimes a book I write will be just as good as the last one, no better, although different than the last one.

43:12.971 --> 43:14.893
And the next one is better.

43:14.913 --> 43:16.675
In what way is better?

43:17.043 --> 43:25.914
in various ways, maybe my way I present my ideas better, maybe I describe something better or simpler, maybe I use better words.

43:27.516 --> 43:30.159
There are a thousand one ways to write up and improve.

43:30.179 --> 43:30.820
But you know it.

43:31.841 --> 43:32.141
Yes.

43:33.143 --> 43:36.367
I know and I read it afterwards, particularly.

43:36.387 --> 43:46.459
And I don't think you should, or at least not for me, I don't think I should cry consciously

43:48.363 --> 43:54.291
I think the idea is to put the idea in the back of your head that you want to do better, and then just go ahead and write.

43:55.272 --> 44:01.260
And afterwards, read it over and see, well, how could I have done this better?

44:01.280 --> 44:04.945
Or how could I have done it differently?

44:04.965 --> 44:10.472
I understand you also do a number of outlaws, and I'm going to switch this tape on the other side and let's see what's going on.
