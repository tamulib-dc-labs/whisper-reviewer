WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:03.432
All right, this thing is going.

00:04.013 --> 00:09.080
What we will do is just talk a little bit and then test to see if it's picking up the office to be.

00:11.363 --> 00:13.886
Why don't we just say that we're in the... All right.

00:14.367 --> 00:14.988
You want me to talk?

00:15.028 --> 00:15.649
Please, yes.

00:15.989 --> 00:21.317
Well, we're now in Warren House on the second floor.

00:23.700 --> 00:27.806
We're about to talk about the Inman Diary.

00:27.946 --> 00:28.907
Okay, and the date is...

00:29.242 --> 00:31.946
This is the 23rd, 23 July.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.708
I want to see if I can pick up my movie.

00:33.728 --> 00:35.070
So 23 July, 1885.

00:35.290 --> 00:36.491
So let's check this out.

00:40.216 --> 00:43.801
We're going to talk about Mr. Inman first.

00:44.562 --> 00:46.484
All right.

00:46.504 --> 00:53.754
This guy, generally, one of the observations I've had is how much work that you've done.

00:53.834 --> 00:57.459
I mean, you certainly were faced with a massive broad data.

00:58.340 --> 00:58.540
Yes.

00:58.874 --> 01:01.077
I had no idea really what I was getting into.

01:01.097 --> 01:17.041
I knew that it was an enormous diary when David Donald, who's a professor of history at Harvard, went through it at the request of the Harvard University Press and the trustees of the Indian estate.

01:17.061 --> 01:28.678
He sampled a great deal of it and then wrote a report, and I believe he might have known how large it was, but he did not actually see the bulk of it.

01:29.350 --> 01:41.446
After I agreed to take this on, my secretary, Elizabeth Smith, and I went down— Henry, can you tell me when this was?

01:43.890 --> 01:46.133
This was in 1977, when we first went.

01:46.173 --> 01:53.603
It really wasn't until 1978 that I really began to do serious work on it.

01:54.275 --> 01:56.638
It was in the fall, I believe, of 77.

01:56.979 --> 02:11.019
And we went down to the Boston Safe Deposit Company, and they hauled out these old, worn trunks and suitcases, just full of stocked with these diaries.

02:11.259 --> 02:14.023
The originals and typescript.

02:14.143 --> 02:15.325
155 volumes.

02:15.345 --> 02:22.034
155 volumes of the original, and then, of course, an additional 155 volumes of the typescript.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.197
Did you work with typescript or with the originals?

02:25.038 --> 02:31.227
With the typescript, but always checking the original, we thought there were some ambiguities.

02:31.247 --> 02:41.941
His writing was miserable, and since he often wrote, I don't think he wrote in the dark, although he stayed a lot of the time in the dark, I think he wrote always with some kind of light.

02:42.522 --> 02:49.712
But there were times when his writing seemed fairly lucid, but most of the time it was practically illegible.

02:50.063 --> 02:55.851
And he had increasingly difficulty finding people who would be able to make these transcriptions.

02:56.392 --> 02:58.215
His wife was invaluable, of course.

02:58.535 --> 03:04.584
And there were other secretaries that he had who he hired to do this.

03:05.184 --> 03:11.073
Of course, he would then go over the typescript, after they had done it, and corrected them.

03:11.854 --> 03:19.024
And there might be three or four different versions, and finally he would settle on the typescript that he wanted.

03:19.207 --> 03:28.780
There are in a sense variants, but most of it came down pretty much to the final diary and the original.

03:30.002 --> 03:34.348
And those are now housed in the Houghton Library.

03:34.629 --> 03:36.031
Did you have any idea what you were getting?

03:36.071 --> 03:36.752
No.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.194
17 million words.

03:38.214 --> 03:39.035
No.

03:39.075 --> 03:43.281
Was it proposed to you as something extraordinary?

03:44.322 --> 03:46.165
It was proposed... Or something enormous.

03:46.265 --> 03:47.847
Something enormous, I knew that.

03:48.333 --> 03:59.024
But once I got into it and began to look at it, then I began to see that this was absolutely enormous.

04:00.125 --> 04:13.159
And I began to feel a little troubled about it, and particularly since, as I read the early parts of the diary,

04:13.612 --> 04:31.732
There was something so unpleasant about Arthur Inman that I wondered what I was doing getting stuck with this character and having to go through all of this bilge, as I thought at the time, in order to extract what might be interesting to the social historian.

04:32.152 --> 04:35.756
I had no idea of the novelistic aspects of it.

04:35.796 --> 04:38.720
I had no notion of the man, no notion of the variety.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.041
At what point were you hooked?

04:46.315 --> 04:46.936
Yes.

04:46.956 --> 04:49.178
At what point did this come to you?

04:49.238 --> 04:55.944
I mean, did you feel that, you know, we've really got something here that is unique?

04:56.064 --> 05:09.396
I think in about a year and a half, I began to—I was writing letters to myself and writing letters to Arthur Inman, and saying, what is this guy up to, what is he going to do?

05:09.536 --> 05:11.118
I begin to see, I begin to see.

05:11.138 --> 05:13.420
And then, I would say, in about a year and a half,

05:14.092 --> 05:22.583
What he, I began to understand his intention, which he didn't understand at the beginning, but as he went on, he began to see what the diary was about.

05:23.545 --> 05:25.628
I began to see what the diary was about.

05:26.288 --> 05:34.419
And then I think it was that that I rather consciously began to shape it as a non-fiction novel.

05:35.140 --> 05:38.665
Do you think he ever really focused on it?

05:39.607 --> 05:43.390
That is a massive literary work.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.032
I think it was his... He early discerned it.

05:47.474 --> 05:52.458
He early saw that if he was going to have any fame at all, it was going to be in this diary.

05:53.339 --> 06:04.148
He early determined that, above all, his whole reason for living was to publish this diary.

06:05.049 --> 06:08.972
You know, it took me a year to outline that diary.

06:09.593 --> 06:10.534
before I did anything.

06:11.114 --> 06:14.157
I simply went through it and made an entry for everything.

06:15.078 --> 06:21.744
It came to eight loose-leaf volumes, 1,300 single-spaced pages.

06:21.764 --> 06:22.765
That's the outline.

06:22.785 --> 06:23.806
That's the outline.

06:25.808 --> 06:26.349
Yeah.

06:26.769 --> 06:33.676
But you are—would you accept the suggestion that this is as much your work as it is?

06:34.116 --> 06:38.200
Well, I began to think of it as my surrogate novel.

06:38.838 --> 07:06.516
I mean, as a person who had always thought of writing a novel and who never had, but finding all the material there, or the analogy that I used in the introduction of a great rock and a monument, and I, with his assistance, discerned the shape of what he wanted it to be, a long Russian novel,

07:06.715 --> 07:10.258
with people entering in and disappearing and coming in again.

07:10.298 --> 07:21.849
Or like Dos Passos, Manhattan Transfer, a book that he read in the 1920s and began to see that he was doing what Dos Passos was doing.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.892
So that there was a conscious literary sense.

07:24.912 --> 07:32.299
He was very critical of most writers and most novelists, certainly the so-called classics, as he called them.

07:32.759 --> 07:34.461
But he loved history.

07:34.846 --> 07:37.890
And he began to see, he did talk about characters, you see.

07:37.910 --> 07:39.292
He did talk about plot.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.557
To hire tellers.

07:42.577 --> 07:42.997
That's right.

07:43.037 --> 07:44.179
Have you ever heard of such a thing?

07:44.239 --> 07:44.399
No.

07:44.419 --> 07:45.541
I mean, have you heard of anything?

07:45.561 --> 07:46.402
No, no.

07:46.462 --> 07:48.665
To hire people to come and tell the stories of their lives.

07:49.086 --> 07:56.736
But you might say, if you wanted to, I've never developed the literary

07:57.762 --> 08:02.409
spin-offs, implications, ramifications of this, any more than I have the psychoanalytical.

08:02.709 --> 08:07.456
Well, it's like a director of hiring a model, actually.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.718
Yes.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.401
Or an informant.

08:12.043 --> 08:17.632
When did you discern that you were a character?

08:18.893 --> 08:18.974
Ah.

08:22.158 --> 08:23.280
After I finished the diary.

08:26.804 --> 08:29.027
and had listed all these directives to me.

08:31.531 --> 08:37.720
I began to think, well, I'm in a kind of special category here.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.924
I began to feel that I had been in some somehow rapport with him.

08:41.966 --> 08:53.141
Then it came to going through and finding all these enormous amounts of the sections of the diary that I had already decided must go in.

08:53.161 --> 08:54.263
I would go through and say,

08:54.682 --> 09:20.706
must this must be in probably could be you see as i went through the outline starring no sections that had to be in it then i came the end in in 1950 51 there were then these enormous diaries how could i possibly get them in it was then that it developed the sort of the henry james trick of foreshortening and i thought of the device with a letter uh

09:20.956 --> 09:28.809
that came from one of the main characters, Edna, the earth woman you may have encountered here already, who left in the 1937.

09:29.551 --> 09:37.745
When she saw the article about me and the project in the Harvard Magazine, she was living in Fort Lauderdale at that time, she wrote.

09:38.927 --> 09:42.793
Then, in replying to her, I thought, what a device.

09:42.974 --> 09:45.478
I will use a series of letters to Edna.

09:45.627 --> 09:56.839
in which I, the editor, who has been more or less holding back in my leads and notes, being rather detached.

09:57.419 --> 10:07.810
But already you can see, as you go through the head notes, sometimes more involvement on my part, more irritation, more sarcasm, or something of this kind.

10:08.251 --> 10:13.356
And then finally, in part six,

10:14.078 --> 10:15.680
I give up impartiality.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.462
I simply write what I think.

10:17.963 --> 10:31.620
And use that in those letters to her to telescope what happened in the last ten years of his life and at the same time summarize and answer questions that have been building up.

10:31.640 --> 10:39.850
So it's the climactic chapter which ends the narrative, which resolves the action, which brings together

10:40.437 --> 11:04.858
uh everything that's happened before and which makes it a novel and which tends to make it of course it's a very special kind of a novel because arthur you know never pretends to know what goes on inside the minds of his characters he thinks that's impossible he can't doesn't understand himself he said how can anybody understand what what other people are doing you only look you only report you only describe

11:10.390 --> 11:14.614
Do I really want to commit so much of my life?"

11:14.634 --> 11:15.535
Exactly.

11:17.356 --> 11:28.567
A number of writers I've interviewed over the years, Tony Thompson comes to mind, the late Tony Thompson said, you know, deciding which book you're going to write, this is a very, very serious decision.

11:28.587 --> 11:33.211
He said, it's like deciding who your mistress is going to be for four or five years.

11:33.231 --> 11:34.532
I said, this is great.

11:35.413 --> 11:38.016
You know, is this the person I want to wake up with every morning?

11:38.616 --> 11:39.537
Am I going to be happy?

11:39.803 --> 11:41.345
I mean, this was his metaphor.

11:42.046 --> 11:49.457
And I suspect that a book is the same type of... Well, you're involved a lot of time.

11:49.837 --> 11:52.581
I went into it for money at the beginning.

11:54.324 --> 11:58.009
It's a noble... Yeah, it was a job, like I take on.

11:58.189 --> 12:01.013
I had done a certain amount of editing.

12:02.295 --> 12:03.256
I loved diaries.

12:05.119 --> 12:07.903
It was a period of my life.

12:09.082 --> 12:13.586
So it was a way of re-seeing my own life through somebody else's eyes.

12:15.207 --> 12:15.527
Did you?

12:17.009 --> 12:18.350
Yes.

12:18.370 --> 12:23.494
In many ways because of the incidents that he talks about that I remember.

12:24.555 --> 12:30.860
Books, authors, events brought back with my own memories.

12:31.441 --> 12:35.284
Did you find yourself agreeing with him or disagreeing with him?

12:35.304 --> 12:38.667
Oh, disagreeing with him most of the time.

12:39.929 --> 12:41.031
Okay.

12:42.152 --> 12:45.998
So, to some extent, I didn't agree with him, of course.

12:46.559 --> 12:51.366
How could I agree with... Well, let me say, let me qualify that.

12:51.707 --> 12:54.831
Yes, there were certain times when I would have agreed with him.

12:54.911 --> 12:56.914
For instance?

12:56.934 --> 13:01.201
His sympathy with the Sandinista Sandino in Nicaragua.

13:01.561 --> 13:02.603
Totally unexpected.

13:03.805 --> 13:05.447
It is totally unexpected.

13:05.849 --> 13:31.283
um his feeling that uh that is not in character that doesn't seem to be in character and yet it does in a way because he's always in the side of the underdog while he while he for example while he was pro-fascist in spain he sympathized with the loyalists too you see uh he uh any any of the underdog it's partly he would say from the southern background his feeling of being part of the defeated south

13:32.275 --> 13:39.462
He's feeling that the Lindbergh kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby didn't get a fair trial.

13:40.623 --> 13:40.863
Yes.

13:43.385 --> 13:44.086
Things like that.

13:44.846 --> 13:46.868
But there were not many, not many.

13:47.229 --> 13:49.451
Sometimes his opinions of books were shrewd.

13:50.532 --> 13:51.212
Mostly not.

13:53.034 --> 13:57.778
But there were people that he admired, and rightly so, you see.

13:57.798 --> 13:59.019
So I had to do that.

13:59.059 --> 13:59.900
How about liking him?

13:59.920 --> 14:01.962
Would you find yourself liking him?

14:02.178 --> 14:06.524
I began to be, I hated him, let me put it that way.

14:07.506 --> 14:10.029
I found him absolutely disgusting and revolving.

14:13.835 --> 14:23.749
But then, you begin to take in this whole world that he lived in, and all of his associates, and he keeps explaining, try to understand me, to the reader.

14:23.889 --> 14:25.852
You know, you think that, so here I am.

14:25.932 --> 14:26.533
To the editor.

14:26.653 --> 14:27.575
To the editor, too.

14:28.356 --> 14:29.878
To the readers and to the editors.

14:29.898 --> 14:31.881
I mean, you are his country.

14:32.333 --> 14:32.974
That's true.

14:33.915 --> 14:42.729
But also unborn readers who might, if his diary makes it, will understand him so they won't hate him too much.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.894
So it's more to the readers than it is to me.

14:46.936 --> 14:48.578
He wants his readers to understand.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.942
Why does he like little girls?

14:51.483 --> 14:53.326
Why does he, you know, all these things.

14:54.387 --> 14:57.913
Why that he complains an awful lot in the diary.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.096
The editor, cut that stuff out.

15:00.430 --> 15:06.516
I did cut a lot of it out, but enough to suggest that he was complaining a good deal.

15:07.978 --> 15:12.863
So that I tried to live up to his directives.

15:12.883 --> 15:26.016
But then I began to admire him to a degree of this passion, this persistence, to carry out this goal, to write this diary, and to try to keep it honest.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.560
I admired him for not going back and changing.

15:30.232 --> 15:43.504
He would go, he would look at his, when he was correcting his diary, he'd look back to what he was twenty years before and be disgusted, and say, well, I'm tempted to cut all this out, but the whole point of the diary would be lost if I did it.

15:43.825 --> 15:44.726
So I'm leaving that in.

15:45.727 --> 15:51.292
I'm impressed by the fact that he quotes the most destructive judgments against him.

15:51.932 --> 15:54.715
So there is a decided degree of integrity in here?

15:54.795 --> 15:55.195
There is.

15:55.216 --> 15:58.939
There's an integrity to the diary, if not to other people.

15:59.965 --> 16:03.249
Do you think in his mind he completed it?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.334
He pretty well did.

16:08.435 --> 16:16.383
I think that towards the end—and you'll see this in the last section of the book—he has, towards the end, saying, I've got to—things are happening.

16:16.403 --> 16:18.466
He knows his world is coming down pretty soon.

16:19.086 --> 16:25.233
I've got to finish, typewrite, get these things done, and all the rest of it.

16:25.253 --> 16:27.576
It was left at the end hanging fire.

16:27.775 --> 16:29.296
He wasn't becoming bored with it.

16:29.397 --> 16:29.877
Not at all.

16:30.217 --> 16:35.162
But he had a feeling that time was—that he wasn't going to kill himself.

16:35.182 --> 16:38.505
And he wanted to get a substantial part of it then, you see.

16:39.286 --> 16:46.012
So there's no clear, resolving coda.

16:46.713 --> 16:48.354
The diary ends in nightmare.

16:49.736 --> 16:51.177
Which is almost appropriate.

16:51.297 --> 16:57.563
Which is, in a way, appropriate, because he lived half his life—certainly half his sleeping life—

16:58.049 --> 17:02.973
Do you think that this guy is a psychiatrist?

17:03.394 --> 17:03.674
Yes.

17:05.015 --> 17:12.842
And I think that the diary itself constitutes one of the most remarkable documents.

17:12.862 --> 17:25.774
That is, for 1919 to 1963 and through 155 volumes, as I said in my introduction, literally on the couch.

17:26.555 --> 17:28.056
Only a tiny bit of this.

17:28.357 --> 17:30.920
It's in the published diary.

17:30.940 --> 17:40.512
But enough, so that if psychoanalysts wanted to go back and reconstruct the whole thing— What would they want to determine, do you think?

17:40.532 --> 17:43.135
Well— I mean, he's dead.

17:43.315 --> 17:44.276
He's dead.

17:44.817 --> 17:57.132
Well, anybody, a psychiatrist— Or an intellectual exercise, what would they— Well, they would—his dreams, which are very, very fully worked out.

17:57.854 --> 18:21.546
his various kinds of prevarications, turd diversations, his attitudes towards his mother and his father, his attitudes towards women, all his curious eccentricities.

18:22.707 --> 18:24.430
And the self-diagnosis.

18:24.530 --> 18:25.852
And the self-diagnosis.

18:26.112 --> 18:27.574
Of course, he had...

18:28.212 --> 18:31.898
His notion, of course, there was nothing organically wrong with him.

18:31.918 --> 18:33.321
I mean, mentally wrong.

18:33.341 --> 18:35.905
It was only organically wrong.

18:36.666 --> 18:38.269
All the defenses that he builds up.

18:38.690 --> 18:46.724
But there would be... He would be, at least for some kind of diagnostician, a classic case of something.

18:47.004 --> 18:48.567
He'd make a hell of a favor.

18:48.847 --> 18:50.190
Well, it would be.

18:50.210 --> 18:53.916
I mean, it could be a book, actually, just the medical side of it.

18:54.605 --> 18:58.550
his interest in crack remedies, the whole medical side of it.

18:59.031 --> 19:11.927
There's a little appendix at the end of the volume, it was volume two, by David Musto, who was our medical advisor, in which he makes his medical opinion of what might have been the case.

19:11.947 --> 19:17.354
But it could be of immense interest, it seems to me, to psychiatrists.

19:17.374 --> 19:23.802
You say that you have enjoyed the retirement diaries, and that this diary is unique.

19:24.963 --> 19:33.296
Is it unique because of its size, because of the many years that he's put into it, or the other qualities?

19:34.077 --> 19:34.177
No.

19:34.598 --> 19:35.799
It is unusually large.

19:36.220 --> 19:52.725
But I found out when I got letters from people, God knows whom, after that article in the Harvard Magazine was published, David Donnell had said in his comment, interviewed by this, quoted by this man,

19:53.363 --> 20:03.473
who wrote about me, a cult that it was the largest diary ever written by an American.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.857
Well, three letters came and said, I've been keeping the diary for as long as mine's much longer than this.

20:08.298 --> 20:08.918
I'm sure.

20:09.279 --> 20:12.342
So there are a lot of people who just write down every day.

20:12.822 --> 20:21.531
But nobody ever wrote a diary which was intended as an apologia,

20:22.709 --> 20:51.433
a history of his times, a man who was going to obtain fame by being completely honest, who would be public and private at the same time, who would exhort, adjure the readers, would address himself constantly to them, telling them about his most private thoughts, but not clearly written to be published.

20:52.426 --> 21:05.645
but yet not a novel, not the kind of diary, not a journal, because this was a day-to-day thing, that it had a plot, a narrative line, all of these things.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.528
I can't think of any diary.

21:08.589 --> 21:12.815
You were calling it, for want of a better phrase, a nonfiction?

21:13.436 --> 21:14.738
In one of its aspects, yes.

21:17.221 --> 21:19.605
That phrase has been used, of course, by the way.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.167
Of course, sure, sure.

21:21.721 --> 21:24.844
with respect to something someone else has written in the form.

21:25.445 --> 21:26.966
Everything is called a novel now.

21:27.567 --> 21:42.481
You see, Thornton Wilder describes a novel—I'm just reading his journals now—as a long narrative work, large parts of which are imaginative.

21:42.501 --> 21:47.385
Now, in that sense, it's not a novel.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.428
Do you think any of this is imaginative?

21:52.045 --> 22:16.737
I don't think, making the comparison to Mary Chestnut up there, I don't think that, first of all, the difference between Mary Chestnut's diary, which I adore, but which I never, even before Van Woodward came out, and I made this point in my own book, The Unwritten War, looking at that book, I said,

22:17.020 --> 22:21.146
This cannot be a true diary.

22:22.147 --> 22:31.321
It has the air of a writer of fiction, that it was put together subsequently.

22:31.341 --> 22:32.182
Twenty years later.

22:32.322 --> 22:33.524
Yes, but I didn't know that.

22:33.824 --> 22:34.646
It was my hunch.

22:35.667 --> 22:42.657
And that it was a better Civil War novel than any southerner ever wrote.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.723
Now, Arthur Inman, or...

22:47.142 --> 22:59.160
Or the George Washington Strong novel, Diary, which to me is the greatest 19th century diary.

23:00.362 --> 23:01.624
George Templeton Strong.

23:04.729 --> 23:05.831
That's okay.

23:05.851 --> 23:09.136
I just want to bring it down so I can probably pull it.

23:09.156 --> 23:09.717
Marvelous.

23:10.077 --> 23:10.378
Great.

23:10.658 --> 23:13.302
But that is a man writing his life every day, too.

23:13.737 --> 23:17.202
and involving himself in history and domestic affairs and so forth.

23:17.222 --> 23:19.845
But it was a diary that he wrote for himself.

23:20.346 --> 23:28.176
He may have thought eventually it was going to be published, but it wasn't published for a long time, and there were no, ever, ever, he took no steps ever to have it published.

23:28.897 --> 23:35.566
Maybe he meant it for his family, but it was a, and he undertook it simply as a kind of an outlet for himself.

23:36.648 --> 23:41.855
So, as it was for Arthur Inman, it was, it began as a kind of outlet for him.

23:42.255 --> 23:42.816
Well, Peeps,

23:43.218 --> 23:44.540
I'm not pronouncing his name.

23:44.560 --> 23:44.680
Pepys.

23:45.441 --> 23:46.383
Pepys kept it.

23:46.503 --> 24:00.844
Of course, he kept it, and I suppose that in some ways, Arthur's Diaries, closely to Pepys's, is that I believe every diarist secretly believes that eventually his diary is going, or her diary is going to be published.

24:00.864 --> 24:01.745
Otherwise, why keep it?

24:02.426 --> 24:12.060
Do you think that this diary will have implications as a window into an era, say, at Pepys's?

24:12.158 --> 24:14.401
Yes, now this is a very good question.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.103
Let me go back to Pepys again.

24:16.764 --> 24:19.006
Pepys wrote it, of course, in secret code.

24:20.268 --> 24:30.721
The idea was to withhold, because he was saying shameless things about himself, his amorous proceedings and things of that kind, and his own comments, that he didn't want to be.

24:30.741 --> 24:38.771
Quite the reverse from Arthur, who even while he was writing the diary, was sending pieces of it out for inspection, and hoping to get it published while he lived.

24:39.592 --> 24:40.393
Quite different.

24:41.268 --> 24:50.982
Arthur thought of himself as being a person who was going to, he said, I'm writing this diary so people 500 years from now will know how an average American lived.

24:51.342 --> 24:51.883
Ridiculous.

24:52.304 --> 24:53.606
He wasn't an average American.

24:53.646 --> 24:55.689
He lived in a special kind of hot house world.

24:56.350 --> 25:04.441
He lived in a little black hole with opening the window up and inviting people coming to tell it, tell it about themselves.

25:05.002 --> 25:08.447
He realized by me that he wasn't the person to do this kind of diary.

25:09.288 --> 25:10.009
On the other hand,

25:10.883 --> 25:23.619
Because of the fact that he did bring in so many people, and he did at least travel around Boston, you get a sense of place, and you get a variety of people who poured in.

25:23.859 --> 25:28.024
And, of course, you only get in the published version a tiny number.

25:29.586 --> 25:31.288
A thousand people, yes.

25:31.569 --> 25:35.694
And they come in one after the other.

25:36.375 --> 25:39.118
So that you get a real cross-section of Americans.

25:39.841 --> 25:42.023
Now, you'd get a suggestion of this.

25:42.043 --> 25:43.805
But I had to keep it down.

25:43.825 --> 25:45.947
Otherwise, it's a good volume.

25:46.287 --> 25:47.328
It's still a pretty large work.

25:47.348 --> 25:49.510
There's still a pretty large work.

25:49.530 --> 25:55.235
But it's less than what... I'm enjoying it enormously, and I think that the first thing that surprised me is that he's a good writer.

25:56.877 --> 26:01.181
His sentences are... You haven't tampered with them, Mr. Leal.

26:01.361 --> 26:04.384
I have... Pardon me, that's the wrong work.

26:04.844 --> 26:05.345
But edit it.

26:05.525 --> 26:06.986
I have edited.

26:07.326 --> 26:09.088
Large sections, I don't.

26:10.739 --> 26:15.423
I hardly touched, for example, the introduction of the Southern Life.

26:16.404 --> 26:32.598
What I did was not to tamper with the sentences, but to eliminate passages sometimes, so that I would have a section, and then I would blot out two paragraphs, and start editing.

26:32.698 --> 26:36.261
I was editing, but not tampering, not changing.

26:36.281 --> 26:37.522
Not changing sentence structure.

26:37.583 --> 26:40.425
Not changing sentence structure.

26:40.743 --> 26:45.067
I mean, I think he could have, if he had focused himself.

26:45.247 --> 26:45.888
I pruned.

26:46.769 --> 26:48.210
Which is an editor's function.

26:48.491 --> 26:49.552
It was an editor's function.

26:49.752 --> 26:50.933
I could say that I performed.

26:51.734 --> 26:54.256
And that, of course, was the most, it was very exhausting work.

26:54.276 --> 26:58.060
And you did kind of shuffle things around shapes, shall we say.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.002
Not in time sequence.

27:00.022 --> 27:00.743
Not in time sequence.

27:00.763 --> 27:00.943
No.

27:01.864 --> 27:03.305
I follow the day by day.

27:03.606 --> 27:05.368
There's no changing there.

27:08.190 --> 27:09.872
But what I did do.

27:10.797 --> 27:25.236
is if at the beginning of the introduction, which are flashbacks taken, they're all over the diary, I arrange those and give the date of the year so it's perfectly clear when those were written.

27:25.837 --> 27:31.624
At the end, I will excerpt the things from the last ten years and give the date.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.406
Because I will go on, then I'll just sit for me, and then I'll go on.

27:36.626 --> 27:38.969
Yes, well, you enjoyed this enormously, didn't you?

27:39.730 --> 27:43.015
Well, I got finally quite excited with it, you see.

27:43.035 --> 27:45.519
And I began to be so familiar with this world.

27:46.761 --> 27:49.745
I mean, families, people, personalities.

27:50.406 --> 27:52.810
You get to know people intimately.

27:54.092 --> 27:58.438
And my secretary and I, Elizabeth Smith, we would talk...

27:58.638 --> 28:00.059
as if these people were alive.

28:00.440 --> 28:07.486
And we'd say, well, you know what Arthur would think about this, or just think what would happen if this happened.

28:07.506 --> 28:20.919
In other words, we became a part of that kind of world, of their associations, their tastes, their political prejudices, their secretiveness, that kind of thing.

28:20.939 --> 28:26.384
I would like, this is kind of nuts and bolts stuff, but I think I will read some of this in the future.

28:26.404 --> 28:27.885
Here we are.

28:28.439 --> 28:55.577
uh the man did leave the sum of money to harvard and to ensure or to accept right to encourage the press yes because that was his whole reason for living this is why he had scrapped he had plotted to even to cheat his father and to do anything he could to get to get money so that would eventually go in when his father died he inherited a lot of money

28:56.232 --> 29:00.837
He had been very successful in real estate business, buying houses in Boston.

29:03.379 --> 29:07.504
In the 50s, of course, you couldn't lose on the stock market if you owned any stocks.

29:08.184 --> 29:11.208
He lost his shirt, of course, in the 20s.

29:12.409 --> 29:15.012
So he had a comfortable income, and she did.

29:16.433 --> 29:26.003
The will, which I don't have a copy of, indicated that Harvard would be given first opportunity, and after Harvard

29:27.130 --> 29:29.152
After Princeton, Yale.

29:29.253 --> 29:32.416
After Yale, Habiford.

29:32.436 --> 29:35.260
But he wanted the University Press.

29:35.420 --> 29:44.191
He wanted the University Press, or if not even—not even a press even to house it, because it was not going to be published, you see.

29:44.291 --> 29:52.140
He had microfilms made of this, and deposited them in various places.

29:52.301 --> 29:53.442
That's really amazing.

29:54.316 --> 30:02.248
And because he thought, of course, the atomic bomb just destroyed the whole point of the diary, because the world wasn't going to last.

30:02.989 --> 30:05.754
He didn't work all these years, and then the bomb drops.

30:05.794 --> 30:14.127
That's a very important section in the diary, when the bomb drops.

30:14.147 --> 30:22.720
And then he had written to Thomas Wilson, at that time the director of the Harvard University Press,

30:23.392 --> 30:25.155
Send him a batch of the stuff.

30:25.175 --> 30:28.320
Wilson found it very, very interesting.

30:28.340 --> 30:30.083
Said, obviously, they couldn't publish all of it.

30:30.864 --> 30:33.107
But left hanging fire, what would happen?

30:34.149 --> 30:35.932
He then killed himself.

30:35.952 --> 30:41.601
And then the trustees reopened the question because he had indicated this in his will.

30:41.621 --> 30:44.846
And that's how Harvard got into it.

30:44.866 --> 30:45.667
Fascinating.

30:45.708 --> 30:50.455
You think that it would have come to pass if he hadn't made these provisions?

30:50.475 --> 30:51.036
I don't know.

30:52.130 --> 30:54.253
I don't know whether Harvard would have had a chance to get it.

30:55.234 --> 30:58.698
And it's a question whether even Harvard would have done it if it hadn't been.

30:58.738 --> 31:12.956
Aida Donald, who's my editor at the Harvard University Press, her husband was David Henry Herbert Donald, one of the most eminent of our historians.

31:12.976 --> 31:21.006
And she had brought back a batch of the manuscript to her house, and David had come in and was flipping through

31:21.273 --> 31:26.899
the diary, began to be more and more fascinated by it, and then said, this is wonderful.

31:27.579 --> 31:37.810
So then he was commissioned by the trustees and the Harvard University Press to read it, or read portions, life portions, and make a report.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.252
He said, this is a remarkable document.

31:40.452 --> 31:44.617
It deserves to be published.

31:44.697 --> 31:48.701
So the man got his wish?

31:48.801 --> 31:51.043
The man got his wish.

31:51.665 --> 31:55.772
Did you ever see that piece in the Harvard magazine?

31:55.972 --> 31:57.715
I was going to ask about that.

31:57.755 --> 31:58.937
You could just get me the data.

31:58.957 --> 32:01.100
I could probably get a copy from that.

32:06.870 --> 32:07.571
Tune it off a bit.

32:07.611 --> 32:08.472
I'll get there yet.

32:08.492 --> 32:10.375
Let me just check how we're doing, too.

32:11.317 --> 32:11.658
Mostly.

32:11.698 --> 32:15.023
I mean, these questions were going around the edges.

32:22.428 --> 32:24.712
I really spend most of my time getting into that.

32:26.255 --> 32:44.368
I think that what makes the book work—I mean, how—a diary as long as this, it can be an awful bore if it was simply a sort of daily litany, if nothing were happening.

32:51.233 --> 32:59.724
You get one glance at it, and then here's Arthur of a completely different point of view, then there's a completely different point of view, and they're sort of contradictory.

32:59.964 --> 33:12.060
He can be very funny, he can be ridiculous, he can be despicable, he can be poignant, all depending on what side you're looking at him.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.966
And you get a picture of him all around, and there's something moving through.

33:18.007 --> 33:18.708
What will happen?

33:18.809 --> 33:19.369
Suspense.

33:20.150 --> 33:20.751
Will...

33:21.119 --> 33:24.924
Will he break up with Evelyn?

33:26.006 --> 33:34.278
Will Dorothy come if so-and-so doesn't want her to come?

33:34.618 --> 33:37.783
What about Mrs. Cash and the fat man?

33:38.464 --> 33:39.245
What's going to happen?

33:39.826 --> 33:41.668
What's going to happen when the fat man dies?

33:42.049 --> 33:44.933
What happens when Charlie runs off her twinkle?

33:45.694 --> 33:47.496
You know, all these things.

33:47.717 --> 33:50.080
You have designated Evelyn a heroine.

33:52.962 --> 33:58.890
When I was in Los Angeles on June 14th, I was going to take the book up to her.

33:59.431 --> 34:02.535
We were going to have copies of the book by August 2nd.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.962
And she died.

34:10.025 --> 34:12.448
Isn't that amazing?

34:12.468 --> 34:12.649
Yes.

34:13.730 --> 34:16.754
And she was wonderful, you know.

34:16.794 --> 34:21.180
She was very candid when she finally...

34:22.983 --> 34:48.465
She accepted me, told me very honestly about her affair with the doctor, and there was only great dignity, intelligence, whose powers were never allowed really to develop.

34:48.585 --> 34:52.348
She was an extremely good writer, very witty.

34:52.531 --> 34:55.014
an admirable woman.

34:55.674 --> 34:58.478
Did Arthur recognize her as a heroine, do you think?

34:58.498 --> 34:59.038
At times.

35:00.119 --> 35:02.722
She is the heroine in your eyes, I think.

35:02.922 --> 35:04.945
Well, in his eyes, too, she would be the heroine.

35:05.005 --> 35:09.530
At the end, it's she that's the only one he can trust.

35:09.550 --> 35:16.477
But it's always alternating, hating and loving her, and not being able to give her up and yet wanting to destroy her.

35:16.577 --> 35:20.682
It's a very—see, this is really, I think,

35:21.117 --> 35:22.760
a work about women.

35:24.142 --> 35:30.712
Think of the number of women that are in there, and the history of the minds and careers of women.

35:32.475 --> 35:34.498
It's a very interesting point, isn't it?

35:34.518 --> 35:35.260
It really is.

35:35.280 --> 35:46.197
Because when you look at his feelings about women, his abuse of them, I mean I think you could use that, you know, that a lot of contemporary women would be

35:46.885 --> 35:50.470
Well, when a woman first reads it, she's in a rage.

35:50.610 --> 35:53.755
She reads everything the male chauvinist did.

35:54.095 --> 36:07.734
And yet, the tributes to women, the interest in women, the way he's fascinated by their experiences, how he's interested in their clothes, how he's interested in maybe always an exploitative way.

36:08.155 --> 36:10.678
But he himself said, no, I want to help them.

36:12.961 --> 36:16.386
But you wonder about his advice, that is to pay no attention to their parents,

36:16.855 --> 36:18.937
Not to go to college.

36:20.398 --> 36:21.839
That kind of thing.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.601
Correct their pronunciation.

36:26.824 --> 36:27.765
Be on their side.

36:28.005 --> 36:29.506
It's almost a community.

36:29.526 --> 36:30.647
Yes.

36:30.827 --> 36:31.448
Maybe.

36:31.468 --> 36:32.489
Yes.

36:32.509 --> 36:36.572
In some ways, that's right.

36:36.592 --> 36:42.197
But anyway, even if it's from that end, it belongs in the history of women in this country.

36:42.677 --> 36:44.179
I think it's an important document.

36:44.239 --> 36:45.580
Very interesting point, isn't it?

36:57.153 --> 37:02.017
important there is, uh, of significance in this.

37:02.037 --> 37:11.025
Um, unless there's something else that you'd want to add on this, uh, we've covered it pretty well, and maybe we can, sure.

37:11.045 --> 37:16.089
Well, now we're going to switch gears.

37:18.591 --> 37:20.393
Switch hats.

37:20.413 --> 37:26.077
And, uh, and this, this really, I don't truly have a focus on this.

37:26.097 --> 37:26.738
Uh, we, we started

37:28.507 --> 37:41.547
I really want to do a story on the Library of America, on literary classics, on your work, on the influence you bring to me, the direction that you would like to see the program take.

37:42.168 --> 37:46.515
It's an unqualified success, certainly, in the three or so years.

37:46.535 --> 37:56.370
Well, it is an unqualified success in one way, if you say a succès d'esteem.

37:56.857 --> 38:02.445
certainly far more successful than we ever thought we would be when we first started, as far as sales are concerned.

38:03.527 --> 38:11.078
But there are still unsolved questions.

38:12.260 --> 38:17.227
Maybe we should think about how far we've come.

38:17.347 --> 38:23.556
What have we redone since the first period?

38:24.734 --> 38:31.822
grant was given to us by the NEH, which followed the promise of the Ford Foundation.

38:34.505 --> 38:41.393
Until that time, it looked as if we were going to meet a great deal of opposition.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.457
It was clear that there were many interests.

38:44.617 --> 38:45.979
Opposition in what respect?

38:46.159 --> 38:51.265
Opposition from various groups, mainly

38:51.616 --> 39:14.101
the directors of university presses, who had spent a great deal of their time and taxpayers' money, although they don't emphasize that so much as the grants came from the government, but they also put some of their own money into it, to do these scholarly editions of certain American writers.

39:15.122 --> 39:18.446
This had been going on for a long time and with mixed results.

39:18.806 --> 39:21.589
Some of the volumes were very good.

39:22.328 --> 39:29.741
Some were much criticized, but they were very special, and they were primarily designed for scholars.

39:29.781 --> 39:30.802
They were very expensive.

39:30.903 --> 39:32.626
And very expensive.

39:32.786 --> 39:45.788
And not accessible to the general readership, although always, they say, there had been plans to publish in paperback the texts of these books.

39:48.704 --> 40:03.078
But there had been—but that had lagged behind, and because of the system they had of hiring out editors, who then in turn hired assistants, these books were coming back very, very slowly.

40:04.279 --> 40:17.952
But at one general meeting at the NEH, we were assailed by many groups, and if it had not been for very

40:18.353 --> 40:26.283
concerned, interested people who really believed in this project.

40:26.343 --> 40:29.467
It might not have gotten off the ground, but it did.

40:29.507 --> 40:47.010
And we were amazed as well as everybody else by the success of the books, partly because of the idea itself, partly because it seemed to be executed with style,

40:47.615 --> 40:56.088
the beauty of the book, the design, the care that went into it, and that we didn't make any great mistakes.

40:56.108 --> 40:57.730
Yeah, there hasn't been a bomb.

40:58.151 --> 41:03.058
Well, except one misprint, with the Melville title.

41:03.078 --> 41:04.300
Everybody wanted a copy.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.705
Everybody wanted a copy, so you could hardly see that.

41:08.566 --> 41:16.558
And I think it was accepted as an idea

41:16.943 --> 41:21.911
that cut across the intellectual and political spectrum.

41:22.693 --> 41:26.800
That is to say... Let's illumine the idea.

41:27.281 --> 41:29.104
Why don't we just say what the idea is?

41:30.105 --> 41:30.827
The idea of what?

41:31.227 --> 41:32.850
The idea of the Library of America.

41:32.870 --> 41:42.867
The idea of the Library of America was to put into print and keep in print

41:43.150 --> 41:50.378
the principal works of American writers.

41:51.879 --> 41:54.903
Great writers, but not necessarily great writers.

41:55.003 --> 42:00.909
Well, we use the word classics.

42:02.831 --> 42:06.856
Writers of enormous historical importance and literary influence.

42:06.876 --> 42:10.980
But you see, when we talk about the classic, I mean, there are very few great classics.

42:11.669 --> 42:12.630
in world literature.

42:12.791 --> 42:13.632
What is a classic?

42:13.792 --> 42:28.973
A classic is a work which, over the centuries, continues to reach very diverse readers and populations who continue to find something remarkable and rewarding in it.

42:29.233 --> 42:32.919
Over the centuries, our literary heritage is... That's right.

42:33.660 --> 42:41.170
We have not, in other words, we have not produced yet a Dante, a Shakespeare, a Montaigne,

42:41.740 --> 42:51.093
We produced an Emerson, a Melville, a Faulkner, but people would dispute this, you see.

42:51.935 --> 42:59.085
They would begin to see in Melville now, certainly someone like that.

42:59.245 --> 43:00.246
Emerson, probably.

43:01.068 --> 43:02.830
Thoreau, some people would dispute it.

43:03.010 --> 43:09.840
Whitman and Poe, most people would.

43:10.225 --> 43:12.728
But you see, there are national classics.

43:13.589 --> 43:31.410
What American literature needs, and what we have to somehow cull, is something that is comparable to the richly textured literature of older societies.

43:32.231 --> 43:34.714
Look at English 19th century writing.

43:35.065 --> 43:40.390
where you have major writers and you have writers slightly less and slightly less and slightly less.

43:40.831 --> 43:49.199
So there's a rich texture, an undergrowth, and you're constantly discovering rather interesting and curious books.

43:50.200 --> 43:56.286
Not great books, but put together gives a richness to the literary soil.

43:57.947 --> 44:02.912
One of the great achievements, it seems to me, of Van White Brooks, who is now usually sneered at,

44:03.145 --> 44:08.391
The makers and finders really attempted to look around.

44:08.431 --> 44:22.568
He read more widely than any American professor had before, reading the various minor little things, as well as the major things, and giving, covering this rather bare literary landscape.

44:23.529 --> 44:24.070
Yeah.

44:27.354 --> 44:27.734
Sure.

44:28.515 --> 44:28.976
What is this?

44:29.016 --> 44:32.680
This is what I asked you for?

44:32.997 --> 44:53.964
What he did was to give some kind of landscape, increase the literary shrubbery, you might say.

44:53.984 --> 45:02.515
And so that I see the Library of America not only having these great single figures standing out like bare pine trees,

45:03.068 --> 45:09.216
but other kinds of growths you see, which really makes the literature interesting.

45:09.316 --> 45:12.019
Do you see a forest growing?

45:12.259 --> 45:19.629
I see a forest drawing, yes, with great trees and lesser trees and charming shrubs.

45:24.695 --> 45:28.660
Collecting the literature makes us more interesting to ourselves.

45:30.522 --> 45:32.805
It also recovers

45:33.427 --> 45:40.017
species that are likely to become extinct, these books going out of print, so finally nobody hears about them.

45:40.197 --> 45:42.500
Which species do you think were most in danger?

45:43.242 --> 45:56.581
Well, I would say that there were a number of writers who wrote one book and were memorable for that, but who also wrote other things that have been forgotten.

45:57.262 --> 46:00.447
Now, what has happened is partly due to American publishing.

46:01.422 --> 46:04.805
American publishers, there are fewer publishers.

46:05.947 --> 46:07.328
There are fewer bookstores.

46:09.330 --> 46:13.514
Bookstore owners can't afford to keep a lot of books on their shelves.

46:14.195 --> 46:16.577
There are not so many second-hand bookstores as there were.

46:17.939 --> 46:31.092
Publishing houses, often taken over by conglomerates, want to publish popular paperbacks so that you'll have any number of editions of Mark Huckleberry Finn or

46:31.240 --> 47:00.825
portrait of a lady or the rise of silas latin or something you're not american yes but anything like that but then try and get other novels of them you see so you so that's one then there are writers who are just out of print try and find john barleycorn before you people write it out exactly exactly yes but try and find the novels of john w de forrest try to find the novels of uh

47:02.054 --> 47:06.299
George Washington Cable, try to find the novels of Harold Frederick.

47:07.900 --> 47:10.443
Now, those people say, well, those are lesser writers.

47:11.084 --> 47:16.690
And what we were charged, our critics said, if these writers are out of print, they deserve to be out of print.

47:17.311 --> 47:21.075
The very fact that they are not... That's what it is.

47:21.375 --> 47:24.078
If you can't compete in the market, you see.

47:24.439 --> 47:27.522
This is, you could say the same thing about species.

47:28.143 --> 47:30.425
If a tamarind monkey goes out, it's a good thing.

47:30.605 --> 47:32.027
He can't survive in this world.

47:32.294 --> 47:33.095
You don't preserve it.

47:33.816 --> 47:36.258
But the tamarind monkey is a very beautiful monkey.

47:36.879 --> 47:41.484
And there are those people who would say, if the Ethiopian dies— That's it.

47:41.764 --> 47:44.748
And you can use that— Pardon me for saying that, but some people would say that.

47:44.788 --> 47:50.294
Well, this is nature's way of saying— Getting rid of the— They're not populated and exploited their resources.

47:50.334 --> 47:50.814
That's right.

47:50.974 --> 47:51.996
But do we accept that?

47:52.016 --> 47:52.756
Of course we don't.

47:53.697 --> 48:01.626
And I think if we're going to give our children and their children a chance to see what American religion is about,

48:02.382 --> 48:06.726
We were accused of being elitist, of telling them what they should read.

48:07.747 --> 48:20.239
On the contrary, they seem to me are elitist because they rule out these books that don't keep on and limit the number of American writers that posterity is going to be.

48:20.519 --> 48:22.101
Is there an influential they?

48:23.962 --> 48:24.383
I don't know.

48:25.284 --> 48:28.567
I have my own ideas, but I wouldn't want to sustain me about that.

48:29.848 --> 48:30.909
But they are there.

48:31.289 --> 48:31.950
They are there.

48:33.331 --> 48:44.963
I'm not trying to get you to pinpoint, because I don't want you to, but is it somehow related again to the university press people, MLA type?

48:45.043 --> 48:45.783
Not necessarily.

48:46.744 --> 48:53.171
Are we just talking about— We're talking about a certain kind of commercial attitude.

48:55.873 --> 48:57.875
That is that publishing is a business.

48:59.217 --> 49:00.418
We're there to make a profit.

49:01.833 --> 49:08.801
And maybe that's the reason it required a non-profit corporation like ours to undertake this.

49:09.342 --> 49:16.511
Maybe you think that also Americans tend to want things right away, going back.

49:17.211 --> 49:18.974
Classics have endured for centuries.

49:19.054 --> 49:28.465
The Divine Common is, what, 600 years, 600 years, 300 years, whatever.

49:29.137 --> 49:32.262
That's right.

49:35.147 --> 49:36.469
But we want our classics now.

49:36.650 --> 49:37.030
Yes.

49:37.050 --> 49:43.902
And another thing is, you see, I think you understand the classics better if you understand what was being written at the same time.

49:46.547 --> 49:50.433
In one sense, it gives us a healthy qualification.

49:50.573 --> 49:54.520
What seems so novel and unique in a writer can be seen

49:54.635 --> 50:01.327
It's like looking at Mozart's contemporaries or Beethoven's contemporaries.

50:01.347 --> 50:13.808
If you see them, listen to their music in the context of their contemporaries, you understand what is unique, what is special about them, and what isn't.

50:15.610 --> 50:19.494
than just a half dozen plays of Sophocles.

50:19.514 --> 50:20.175
That's right.

50:20.255 --> 50:22.337
And we only have a fraction of their plays.

50:22.397 --> 50:23.158
That's right.

50:23.178 --> 50:28.063
And if we follow the dictum of the people who are talking about them.

50:28.083 --> 50:29.845
Well, only the best ones survive.

50:30.085 --> 50:30.185
Yes.

50:30.345 --> 50:33.128
They would still say, we have them in libraries.

50:34.269 --> 50:36.772
I understand.

50:36.792 --> 50:39.134
But how many libraries, you see?

50:39.935 --> 50:43.018
We're getting letters from librarians.

50:43.505 --> 50:50.334
all over the tiny little towns all over the country, because of this Mellon plan, you know, of distributing our books.

50:50.394 --> 50:55.681
We have a ton of, well, you know, Massachusetts, I mean, every little town has a little library.

50:55.762 --> 50:58.205
But there are many places where... We're all getting in on this.

50:59.426 --> 50:59.647
Pardon me.

50:59.667 --> 51:03.111
Well, there are many places that aren't near a major library.

51:04.113 --> 51:11.723
Say, in Worcester, you have Magnificent Library, but other places, you don't.

51:12.648 --> 51:21.961
But I think that the fact that these books are coming out are being written about, are being re-seen.

51:24.244 --> 51:34.418
Gore Vidal writes that Howells, you don't associate Howells with Gore Vidal, and yet Howells, Gore Vidal wrote this rather spectacular tribute to Howells.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.364
You have people discovering Francis Parkland.

51:38.404 --> 51:39.465
We never thought of him.

51:43.934 --> 51:55.666
And I'd like to think that coming closer to home, the new Leatherstocking series—now here's Jim Beard, working all these years on this.

51:55.967 --> 51:56.507
Forty years?

51:56.527 --> 52:00.011
Yes, quietly, you know, putting an enormous amount of work in it.

52:00.551 --> 52:10.802
I'd like to think that bringing it out first—because they'll bring it out in their paperback—but bringing it out first this way is going to bring more public attention

52:11.390 --> 52:19.401
To him, who has been one of the leading architects of Cooper studies, but also to make people, yeah, Cooper.

52:19.421 --> 52:24.348
I remember reading Cooper when I was a kid, or I couldn't, you know.

52:24.468 --> 52:31.939
And so that it has a sort of regenerative, synergistic effect, you see.

52:32.860 --> 52:34.362
It's been marvelous.

52:34.382 --> 52:41.312
Determining classics.

52:42.929 --> 52:57.649
If we were not, then I left the back of that.

52:57.669 --> 52:58.370
And that's why people were talking.

52:58.390 --> 52:59.591
Just to warn you, I just wasn't afraid when we were talking.

52:59.611 --> 53:00.653
And I'm always about sitting up and folding with it.

53:00.673 --> 53:02.355
We used to be a trucker, or a shell truck, but mostly they were pulled in a trucker.

53:02.926 --> 53:24.494
and all that down in the world they kept in front of us.

53:24.514 --> 53:25.155
Now it's in Australian football.

53:25.175 --> 53:25.575
Now it's a good day.

53:25.596 --> 53:26.757
Somebody was foolish enough to tell me that it needs to be

53:28.677 --> 53:44.188
You're wrong, aren't you?

53:44.810 --> 53:57.283
Now, I love your cook, and it was a wonderful friend of mine.

53:57.303 --> 53:59.448
I tell all of you that it was a friend of mine who had judged the time and who would have to live the care.

53:59.468 --> 54:00.912
And an unmarried lady who worked very hard in her life and had very good

54:05.532 --> 54:14.022
in Australia.

54:14.042 --> 54:16.993
I didn't sign down for my friend's warranty, but my manager's rather contact in the US in Australia.

54:17.935 --> 54:39.596
It was called Cooking with Colleen Catholic in New York.

54:39.616 --> 54:40.217
And it was wonderful cookbook.

54:40.237 --> 54:43.140
It wouldn't have been very close to me like that because it seems to be incredibly useful to you, which I would like to call the dodged cookbook.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.601
It was full of wonderful recipes about potatoes, butter, and everything.

54:44.885 --> 55:03.852
have reached sources.

55:03.872 --> 55:10.942
But it's also actually quite useful for people because it was written by two scientists, me and G. Lisa, and we found ourselves much more interested in explaining quite a new pattern of topics.

55:10.962 --> 55:13.626
So we explained in very simple, easily understood language, why they're dry, and what makes batting salad work, and things like that.

55:13.960 --> 55:29.744
It did very well, I must say, indeed.

55:29.764 --> 55:30.705
It never took off the ground very much, really.

55:30.725 --> 55:32.408
Some of the ingredients have different boundaries, but some are not plongebous here.

55:36.286 --> 55:57.215
It's mostly it's been said.

55:57.235 --> 55:57.315
Yes.

55:57.335 --> 55:58.517
You made a problem that you've been very talented with you.

55:58.537 --> 55:59.138
Oh, I would often strike that.

55:59.158 --> 56:00.960
You feel like you said, you've been tackling now that you've been talking about something.

56:00.980 --> 56:01.621
You don't have a little problem.

56:01.641 --> 56:02.122
You've got to tackle it.

56:02.142 --> 56:02.663
I'll get that in some way.

56:02.683 --> 56:03.884
But you did it again, and you've been trying to saturate it.

56:03.904 --> 56:04.285
Have you seen that?

56:04.265 --> 56:16.047
I think it would probably not be very popular with Princeton's fundamentalist practice, but I think it would be very popular with Princeton's fundamentalist practice.

56:18.659 --> 56:32.285
When I'm out about writing a few things, I really, except myself.

56:32.305 --> 56:34.690
And luckily for me, I think there will always be a lot of people out there, even though I never got a film based again.

56:34.710 --> 56:36.513
People would like what I'm not, and I think there are a lot of people who don't like free.

56:36.533 --> 56:37.495
The critics don't like me, and they act like me.

56:37.475 --> 56:53.459
I usually get chatted by cookies, particularly the cookies that you didn't have time.

56:53.479 --> 56:54.200
For some, I've reached them.

56:54.220 --> 56:55.302
Probably because I make an awful lot of money.

56:55.322 --> 56:56.884
We don't like rather to make an awful lot of money because, on the whole,

56:56.864 --> 57:06.764
their photographs themselves.

57:10.271 --> 57:11.073
And they're not anything that's clear.

57:11.093 --> 57:12.696
So they're not clear about it, because they're telling some awfully good people.

57:13.030 --> 57:24.369
They've found anybody who's different than anything else.

57:24.489 --> 57:27.674
I'm not trying to say I'm a different worker anymore.

57:27.694 --> 57:28.476
I'm trying to say it's better.

57:28.496 --> 57:29.257
The books are pretty polite.

57:29.277 --> 57:31.160
You should go back last.

57:31.260 --> 57:36.669
Because in the long run, the only people in the world who can be told, whether a book is back last year or not, are the people who buy it from you.

57:36.689 --> 57:37.671
And if people don't buy books,

57:38.917 --> 57:59.357
for any other reason than that, they either want to enjoy more and more about the book.

57:59.377 --> 58:01.759
And luckily, what a priest is saying, how a priest is supposed to the book is not how a reader is supposed to the book.

58:01.779 --> 58:04.722
And I think that's important, and I don't have any advice with you, but I just don't see why people write it if they're pretty different than that.

58:07.520 --> 58:36.463
Do you think there's a good story in the opal gouters

58:41.692 --> 58:57.661
I've had to see a few years ago.

58:57.681 --> 59:02.750
In the days where the only woman who lived in season three was a lesbian lady in this college, Opal.

59:02.770 --> 59:03.752
So she was right around the market today.

59:03.772 --> 59:05.134
And there were five of us girls and we had to have a split test.

59:05.114 --> 59:11.298
because my whole town was just men who didn't teach him and girls in those days.

59:11.319 --> 59:12.222
And it was pretty rough.

59:16.673 --> 59:42.023
Is anybody planning to write this story there?

59:42.526 --> 01:00:06.462
The Australian Bookseller Association, I think, has a civilian year.

01:00:06.482 --> 01:00:08.145
The best people you ask would be Richard Walton, somebody like that, and like Stan.

01:00:08.165 --> 01:00:08.946
You probably know a lot more than I do.

01:00:08.966 --> 01:00:09.627
I talked with your friends a bit.

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:10.007
I have a question.

01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:10.588
What did your religion have?

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:11.149
My religion is that, ma'am.

01:00:11.348 --> 01:00:26.205
Very interesting, really.

01:00:26.225 --> 01:00:34.654
My family was a church before I was born, mostly because the owner left everything he had in the Catholic Church.

01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:35.915
Very aptly, because he's a normal church, don't be doing that.

01:00:35.935 --> 01:00:36.796
However, I was educated in Catholic school.

01:00:36.816 --> 01:00:40.140
My father was an Irishman from Oxford, a Scottish family.

01:00:41.707 --> 01:00:54.148
So I was educated in public school because my mother was convinced that it was the best education.

01:00:54.168 --> 01:00:56.712
I think there was a deal she said for that and I think she probably got lost.

01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:13.419
And I don't know what Germaine Greer says, which is that everything, her feminism, her attitude to life, is not the product of her mom.

01:01:13.439 --> 01:01:15.122
She might have called me several times, but

01:01:15.102 --> 01:01:29.867
It's a bond for the nuns who have a proper delivery or demarital stuff like that.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.952
And I know why she said it, because there's no domesticated female.

01:01:32.972 --> 01:01:39.523
And they encouraged you, if you were a black child, they encouraged you to throw in your nuns and not to worry too much about...

01:01:40.178 --> 01:01:49.253
You know, there's a more orthodox given by getting married and having children.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:50.779
We were tremendously close to the university in a day and day in Australia.

01:01:54.742 --> 01:02:12.042
um it was a good background my family was naturally very forward

01:02:12.022 --> 01:02:35.961
So I used to, I went to a highly academic school, so I had to, my husband's childhood, I had all that religion in school, went home for a 28th century family, and I had all that school up into the school, and my husband was doing job stuff.

01:02:35.981 --> 01:02:36.442
It's true, that's true.

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:36.983
We can't disagree with it.
