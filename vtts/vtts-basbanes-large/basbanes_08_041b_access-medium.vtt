WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:09.162
Yeah, we'll drive to the locations.

00:10.163 --> 00:12.065
Nance will photograph them.

00:12.085 --> 00:13.086
We'll develop the prints.

00:13.667 --> 00:14.708
I'll put them up on the desk.

00:14.728 --> 00:20.313
And as I'm writing the scene, the starting point will always be that specific place.

00:20.934 --> 00:22.475
And I can go back and I can point to it.

00:22.515 --> 00:30.904
But to give you a for instance, in the first book, there's a deco, an art deco hotel that the drug lord lives in.

00:31.705 --> 00:33.126
And the starting point for it

00:33.865 --> 00:36.549
was the old Aurora down on Main Street.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.294
Oh, there you go.

00:40.374 --> 00:45.942
Oh, yeah, just drive you crazy.

00:47.324 --> 00:50.809
So the starting point was the Aurora down on Main Street.

00:50.869 --> 00:53.212
There you go.

00:54.113 --> 00:59.080
But if you read it in the book, clearly, you know, it is not the Aurora.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.223
It is the Aurora, you know,

01:01.642 --> 01:04.807
magnified, you know, turned around, reassembled.

01:07.491 --> 01:09.233
That's my feeling, you know.

01:09.253 --> 01:09.734
Right.

01:12.378 --> 01:14.661
I'm here to do whatever I want to, you know.

01:15.302 --> 01:24.135
So, the second book, I was in the process of writing it while the first book was going to print.

01:25.136 --> 01:31.125
And the second book came out in fall, I guess October of...

01:32.405 --> 01:42.179
And that was a lot of fun when that book was published, because I went on two publicity tours for the first time.

01:42.940 --> 01:47.086
And the first tour, we went to the Midwest.

01:47.206 --> 01:54.476
It was me and five other crime writers from Mysterious Press, all big-time pros.

01:55.398 --> 01:57.641
We had an assortment.

01:57.661 --> 02:00.164
We had the most diverse array of personalities.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.007
We had Marsha Muller.

02:02.948 --> 02:03.569
K.K.

02:03.589 --> 02:10.200
Beck, Jim Crumley, Peter Lovesy, and Paco Taibo and myself.

02:10.921 --> 02:15.288
And what we did was they started us in Omaha, Nebraska at a convention.

02:16.570 --> 02:29.091
We were there for three days and then we got on a bus and we went to, oh God, we went to Des Moines, we went to Milwaukee, we went to Minneapolis, we went to Chicago.

02:29.527 --> 02:33.934
And most of it, we flew a few places to save time, but we were mainly on a bus.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.935
We had a chartered bus.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.561
And so they took these six strangers, threw them on the bus.

02:38.581 --> 02:40.143
You know, it was like something on MTV.

02:40.163 --> 02:42.367
It was, we sort of got to live together.

02:42.487 --> 02:45.291
Oh, it was great.

02:45.471 --> 02:46.553
It was, you know, it was wonderful.

02:46.593 --> 02:49.317
Were you, like, signing at mystery bookshops and stuff?

02:49.337 --> 02:53.644
Yeah, we'd have, every town we'd go to, we'd go to bookstores,

02:54.097 --> 02:59.323
We'd go to radio stations, we'd go to some TV stations, and then we'd meet with the local press.

03:00.524 --> 03:02.106
I would guess so, yeah.

03:02.706 --> 03:08.793
Taking the six of us out to dinner every night was a... It was a harrowing prospect, yeah.

03:09.473 --> 03:16.841
And the great part for me was, you know, I had never gotten a chance to really know any other professional writers, you know.

03:17.001 --> 03:20.125
And my dream my whole life was to get to know some of these people.

03:20.645 --> 03:22.247
And every one of them...

03:22.835 --> 03:51.390
was just magnificent to me you know they just treated me so you know i was clearly the low man on the totem bowl it was only my second book nobody out there knew who i was you know we'd go to signings and jim crumley would literally have people who had driven a thousand miles in a van you know i remember we were in milwaukee and a guy got out of a van with a case of beer and handed him the case of beer and he had all his first editions to be signed you know dating back to the first book you know the first military book that

03:51.826 --> 04:02.218
one to Count Cadence, and he said, I own a restaurant in Key West, and if you ever come down there and, you know, every meal you want is on the house, you know, they're just worshipping it, you know.

04:03.299 --> 04:07.063
And these people were just... How did the second book do?

04:07.083 --> 04:12.970
The second book did good, went into a paperback edition, and it garnered, you know, some good reviews.

04:12.990 --> 04:17.515
It got named as, who's the Los Angeles Times critic?

04:18.016 --> 04:18.436
Champlin?

04:19.598 --> 04:20.719
I can't remember his name.

04:21.222 --> 04:26.288
He picked it as one of the top 10 crime novels in 93, which we got a lot of mileage on that.

04:26.448 --> 04:27.029
That was great.

04:27.890 --> 04:30.453
And that brings us to the current book.

04:30.473 --> 04:33.136
So tell me what the goals are.

04:33.156 --> 04:39.103
I mean, this is a long, this is a sustained fall.

04:39.123 --> 04:39.543
Oh, man.

04:40.444 --> 04:42.607
I mean, you try to get more each time.

04:43.287 --> 04:46.011
Each new book, you hope they get the paperbacks of the earlier books.

04:46.031 --> 04:46.611
Absolutely.

04:46.691 --> 04:48.934
It's just a building process.

04:49.437 --> 04:57.688
My game plan is I leave, and I don't know if it's lax or not, but he's so good at it, I leave almost all those details to my agent.

04:58.769 --> 05:00.772
He knows how to build a career, and I do not.

05:01.573 --> 05:04.096
So I've decided my job is to write the books.

05:04.697 --> 05:07.080
And from that point on, he knows what to do.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.242
How frequently does he want them to come out?

05:09.823 --> 05:12.006
This is like three years, two and a half years.

05:12.026 --> 05:13.147
Yeah, this is a problem.

05:13.348 --> 05:15.951
I'd like to get them to him.

05:16.657 --> 05:17.298
I mean, one a year.

05:17.318 --> 05:17.638
Sooner.

05:18.339 --> 05:22.965
Yeah, the publisher would like to have it, you know, every year, have one out there.

05:23.245 --> 05:24.727
You've got to keep that name recognition.

05:24.747 --> 05:26.930
But I can't see where that is ever going to happen for me.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.532
A, for a couple of reasons.

05:28.692 --> 05:31.796
One is that the books are getting longer.

05:32.096 --> 05:42.529
You know, the last book, by the draft that we turned in to the publisher, which was probably my sixth or seventh draft at that point,

05:43.842 --> 05:46.706
was in excess of 150,000 words.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.611
We cut it down severely after that.

05:50.072 --> 05:52.736
They had to be close to a dozen drafts by the time the book came out.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.659
They like 90,000 words.

05:54.679 --> 05:57.182
Yeah, they get real nervous once you cross that 100,000 mark.

05:57.202 --> 05:59.306
Mine is 250.

05:59.806 --> 06:00.548
So you can imagine.

06:04.654 --> 06:06.677
My first contract was for 90,000 words.

06:07.653 --> 06:11.960
You know, you can't make it conform to some... I think you tell me what to cut.

06:11.980 --> 06:12.221
Right.

06:12.661 --> 06:13.623
That's exactly right.

06:13.723 --> 06:14.124
You're right.

06:14.204 --> 06:17.509
You know, there's a... Tell me.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.130
Tell me.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.913
What's superfluous here?

06:19.933 --> 06:20.654
What's repetitive?

06:21.235 --> 06:22.558
And what... What doesn't belong?

06:22.718 --> 06:27.105
What is going to make it a... What cut is going to make it a better book?

06:27.145 --> 06:32.614
I don't, you know... That's why that was another kind of bone of contention with randomness, that they were going to make me cut 200 pages.

06:33.235 --> 06:34.437
Not to make it a better book.

06:35.412 --> 06:37.355
to make it a less expensive book.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.536
It's an accounting process.

06:38.697 --> 06:40.379
And it was production costs.

06:40.499 --> 06:40.920
Absolutely.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.942
And Alan, I think I could hope, God bless him when he took it on.

06:42.962 --> 06:44.865
I said, well, Alan, I really cut this thing.

06:45.185 --> 06:46.127
He said, who told you to cut it?

06:46.147 --> 06:48.210
I didn't tell you to cut it.

06:48.230 --> 06:49.051
That's what you want to hear?

06:49.451 --> 06:51.114
And I said, well, shit, it's a big book.

06:51.374 --> 06:52.395
He said, I told you.

06:52.415 --> 06:53.977
He said, we're committed to the book.

06:54.218 --> 06:54.538
God.

06:54.759 --> 06:55.099
Whatever.

06:55.179 --> 06:56.140
And then you look at things.

06:56.160 --> 06:56.982
Look at the notes.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.363
The notes are not an agate type.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.465
The notes are full.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.046
Absolutely.

07:00.066 --> 07:00.747
You can read them.

07:01.748 --> 07:02.529
Look at the end sheet.

07:02.549 --> 07:04.592
You know, I mean, I got a...

07:04.927 --> 07:09.433
It's a very small advance, $15,000, that's all I got.

07:09.453 --> 07:10.174
But who cares?

07:10.214 --> 07:13.479
They put the money into doing a beautiful, now we're up to $50,000.

07:13.519 --> 07:15.341
They made a really quality product.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.807
So have your royalties started kicking in yet?

07:19.927 --> 07:20.989
No, I haven't got anything yet.

07:21.129 --> 07:22.110
Nada.

07:22.851 --> 07:25.014
I think mine come in April and October.

07:25.074 --> 07:26.016
Is that when you're April?

07:26.036 --> 07:28.980
So April, you should be a substantial check should become rolling.

07:29.761 --> 07:31.102
Yeah, but you know they hold back 50%.

07:32.004 --> 07:32.284
Yeah.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.142
I just learned this the other day.

07:34.222 --> 07:34.762
The reserves.

07:34.903 --> 07:37.706
I had the numbers in my head, how much we're going to get, you know.

07:38.607 --> 07:41.210
But there's some time period, and I never know what it is.

07:41.270 --> 07:42.171
Yeah, that's the next one.

07:42.632 --> 07:43.133
But you know what?

07:43.153 --> 07:44.775
There are no returns in my book.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.917
My book's been on back order since day one.

07:47.017 --> 07:50.622
So they shouldn't even hold anything back from the first payment.

07:50.982 --> 07:57.049
And he said to me, he said, this does suck, because as we speak, we're 2,400 copies on back order.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.293
And your agent should be able to... It's the contract.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.395
They're going to hold to it, yeah.

08:01.555 --> 08:01.815
It's fine.

08:02.470 --> 08:05.414
Next October.

08:05.494 --> 08:08.178
That's in the next one.

08:08.198 --> 08:09.360
That one was on the church.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.742
This one's on hope.

08:11.323 --> 08:11.843
That's right.

08:13.305 --> 08:14.667
Exactly.

08:14.687 --> 08:17.111
That's a good way to look at it.

08:17.131 --> 08:17.812
Oh, man.

08:17.852 --> 08:23.139
So we're talking about building the oeuvre, so to speak.

08:23.159 --> 08:29.849
Well, do you ever see leaving the insurance business, or is writing always going to be a label of love for you?

08:29.889 --> 08:31.431
My standard answer to that

08:31.580 --> 08:34.745
is that, you know, it's simplistic.

08:34.785 --> 08:37.169
Yeah, and it isn't even that.

08:37.269 --> 08:42.577
It's that, you know, I'm so ritualistic and superstitious that my feeling is it isn't broke.

08:43.278 --> 08:44.260
I don't want to fix it.

08:44.280 --> 08:52.192
You know, I almost feel like... Well, you know, I say to myself, and I've discussed it with my wife, let's assume I became full-time.

08:52.253 --> 08:56.199
I wonder, you know, would it change my whole attitude toward the writing?

08:56.239 --> 08:57.621
Suddenly, oh, you know...

08:58.276 --> 09:11.612
this is my income, I've got to do it, it fulfills certain other responsibilities now, and I, you know, I don't want to, I sort of don't want to think about the writing that way, you know, hopefully, Blackwood, but we'll see what happens.

09:11.632 --> 09:24.047
So, how about characters, and I can't say I've read the whole corpus now, but do you see continuing characters, and are there everyone... No, everyone, I have a

09:24.432 --> 09:26.074
That would be the easy way.

09:26.094 --> 09:26.635
Yeah.

09:26.655 --> 09:28.117
I can't do a series character.

09:28.137 --> 09:29.318
It just isn't in me to do it.

09:29.338 --> 09:38.130
When the first book hit and it started to look good, the first thing the editor said to me was, you know, for the next book, are you bringing her back?

09:38.330 --> 09:39.672
You know, bring the heroine back.

09:39.692 --> 09:42.095
And I just, I can't.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.436
She is, her name is.

09:43.456 --> 09:45.759
In the first book, it was Lenore Thomas.

09:46.721 --> 09:48.062
And I couldn't bring myself to do it.

09:48.082 --> 09:48.583
I just can't.

09:49.053 --> 09:55.540
I do have reoccurring characters, but usually they're background people, and it just provides some continuity from book to book.

09:56.221 --> 10:06.133
But in terms of having, you know, that central focal point, you know, and that person's point of view continues book to book to book, I just, I can't write that way for some reason.

10:06.193 --> 10:12.840
It just doesn't... Do you do any field work in terms of crime and talk to cops and stuff, or is that pretty much head stuff?

10:12.860 --> 10:18.587
It's main, you know, you can, well, I shouldn't say that the reader is the judge, but it isn't that hard to...

10:19.023 --> 10:29.917
fudge anything you need to fudge in terms of, you know, when the first book came out, I got some calls from a couple friends who read it who said, God, I've known you 10 years, you know, I never knew you were a gun nut.

10:29.937 --> 10:31.419
And I said, I never owned a gun in my life.

10:31.439 --> 10:33.061
You know, there's all this gun stuff in there.

10:33.102 --> 10:36.586
You go to the Worcester Public Library, you take Encyclopedia of Guns down, boom.

10:37.207 --> 10:42.354
You know, but I have, I have two uncles who were, you know, policemen for 30 years.

10:42.494 --> 10:47.140
You know, I have a cousin who, and kids I went to school with who were all cops, you know.

10:47.339 --> 10:49.883
And so I get great stories from them constantly.

10:49.903 --> 10:53.028
And do they help you with the detail and the stuff?

10:53.048 --> 10:53.528
They do.

10:54.049 --> 11:00.499
And yet, what I'm always striving for is just enough versimilitude to get it over that.

11:00.519 --> 11:07.930
In other words, I'm not aiming by any stretch of the imagination to do some kind of gritty, realistic, you know...

11:08.753 --> 11:10.435
by-the-numbers police story.

11:10.455 --> 11:13.778
This is not hard-boiled in any way in your view.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.222
Well, it's gritty and it's hard-boiled, but it certainly isn't realist.

11:17.262 --> 11:20.305
I mean, I don't really believe in realism.

11:20.385 --> 11:22.007
I mean, I don't come out of that tradition.

11:22.027 --> 11:36.482
I mean, the writers that I love and that I emulate and that I think that I steal from continually are people like Pinchon, or, you know, especially, you know, Latin Americans, you know, the guys who all pointed me in the right direction, you know, Garcia Marquez and

11:37.340 --> 11:52.836
and Borges and stuff, you know, what I'm sort of doing is taking all these noir conventions and sort of slapping them over an Americanized magical realism, you know.

11:53.056 --> 11:53.877
Do you hear from readers?

11:55.238 --> 11:55.539
Yeah.

11:57.401 --> 11:59.583
I got my first death threat not too long ago.

12:00.023 --> 12:04.528
That was, yeah, I got a couple of, it was on the second book, actually.

12:04.880 --> 12:30.347
when the second book came out, and it was from, and it was, I thought this was so appropriate, it was from Dallas, Texas, assassination capital of America, and it was on letterhead from some sort of a television station affiliate, you know, and some network affiliate, I said, oh, good, it's a media person, great, and it was, it was one of those classic unhinged letters, you know, just expletive, expletive, expletive, you know, and the problem was, you know, you, you are, uh,

12:31.610 --> 12:40.764
You know, the foul language you use and the type of degenerates that you write about are, you know, exactly what is wrong with the moral fiber of America, you know.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.827
Right, yeah, yeah.

12:43.048 --> 12:45.792
And I sort of took that as a real badge of honor, you know.

12:46.814 --> 12:49.097
I pushed exactly the button I wanted to push there.

12:49.558 --> 12:50.940
Well, what do you hear from people around here?

12:51.180 --> 12:52.122
People around here.

12:52.182 --> 12:57.330
Maybe you're creating an image of their beloved hometown that...

12:57.935 --> 13:06.871
You know, I've yet to have anybody, in the three books, I've yet to have somebody come up to me and say, you know, why the hell do you make Worcester look so bad, you know?

13:07.452 --> 13:19.673
My feeling is the people who are sophisticated enough, the people who pick up the book in the first place, are sophisticated enough to say, oh, this is interesting what you're doing, you know, and...

13:20.092 --> 13:22.114
And clearly, again, it isn't Worcester.

13:22.374 --> 13:28.199
It isn't as if I'm blaspheming my hometown.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.062
I mean, as I say to everybody, I love Worcester.

13:31.462 --> 13:35.446
I've been here for 36 years.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.869
I don't see that I'm going anywhere in the foreseeable future.

13:39.610 --> 13:48.478
And to me, and this was, I talked to, I wrote to, I had the opportunity, the good fortune to meet

13:48.728 --> 13:50.329
a couple years ago, Robert Cormier.

13:52.011 --> 13:53.232
And what a wonderful guy.

13:53.272 --> 14:01.459
As much as a wonderful writer, just a wonderful man, you know, just a warm, gracious individual.

14:02.059 --> 14:08.144
As a matter of fact, I had a signing last week over at Tatnick, and I look up at one point, and he's standing there.

14:08.545 --> 14:11.387
I just said, Robert Cormier, coming to my signing, something's wrong.

14:11.627 --> 14:12.628
Something's out of whack.

14:12.989 --> 14:16.952
He wrote a beautiful letter, and he wrote a thing in the Book of the Month book.

14:16.972 --> 14:18.313
And I don't belong to him.

14:19.036 --> 14:37.114
And Bob said, I am just so happy for you and all the good things, and he's read the reviews and the Washington Post, and I said, I had a handwritten letter.

14:37.134 --> 14:39.997
He's just, oh, that's exactly how he is, you know.

14:41.058 --> 14:47.845
And I said to him, in talking, you know, I said, you know, the first

14:49.647 --> 14:51.190
15 years of your life, you know.

14:51.991 --> 15:02.149
And when you're in this small city from a real middle-class environment, and you're reading these little paperbacks day and night, you're just eating them like candy, you know.

15:03.271 --> 15:09.362
And the world of the paperbacks at times is seeming more real than the bourgeois life in the city.

15:09.382 --> 15:10.845
Well, we baptized my first...

15:11.551 --> 15:15.216
my older daughter down at Eden, you know, which my father-in-law owned.

15:15.576 --> 15:16.277
Oh, my God!

15:16.317 --> 15:17.258
I never knew that!

15:17.338 --> 15:18.259
My father-in-law.

15:18.279 --> 15:19.361
Oh, my God!

15:19.381 --> 15:22.945
I married a Worcester girl, Connie is... Classic!

15:22.985 --> 15:25.148
...who is, you know, next door, right?

15:25.989 --> 15:27.351
And... Jeez!

15:27.691 --> 15:41.288
So, when we baptized her, and I was, she was born in 81, and I was book editor in 78, so, and I got to know Bob right away, and he came, you know, with his wife, did the thing, and I, but my brother's daughters at that point were like 13, 14, and I said,

15:41.572 --> 15:45.859
Lauren, I want you to meet Robert Cormier, and she was... A hero!

15:46.880 --> 15:50.246
Just, you know, God has come down, absolutely.

15:50.266 --> 15:52.169
She's 15, actually, because she's about 39.

15:52.409 --> 15:56.155
I mean, it was... Holy mackerel, Robert Cormier!

15:56.175 --> 15:56.816
Just amazing.

15:57.076 --> 15:58.218
Just Robert Cormier.

15:58.238 --> 15:59.720
You know Robert Cormier.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.243
You scored points.

16:01.263 --> 16:09.756
Here he is at my... But as I said to him, and the same thing happens in...

16:10.040 --> 16:38.865
his books which I love so much is that you know those first years when you're a young person and you're wanting so badly so desperately to become a writer and you don't know how to become a writer you view your whole environment as such a limiting place you know like you have to transcend this in order to become you know I literally grew up with the idea that in order to become a writer you know you had to you had to like live in Manhattan you had to come from Manhattan you had to go to special schools you know you had to come from this whole different cast you know

16:39.419 --> 16:49.052
And then what ends up happening, if you persist enough, is that you realize what you have of value to write about is exactly those things that you would have thought were limiting, you know.

16:49.293 --> 16:50.495
And you just have to find the method.

16:50.515 --> 16:55.121
The only guy that really does bemoan the fact that he hasn't done anything is Updike, you know.

16:56.403 --> 17:00.388
He envies people who have life experiences because he's been so fortunate.

17:00.408 --> 17:02.611
Trapped in horrible, heavenly farms.

17:02.672 --> 17:04.895
He's been a successful writer from the age of 22.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.237
From the start, you know.

17:06.257 --> 17:06.557
Right.

17:06.959 --> 17:10.264
And so he goes out on these trips, and lousy books come out of him.

17:10.284 --> 17:11.926
You know, the one down in... The Brazil book?

17:11.946 --> 17:12.607
The Brazil book.

17:12.627 --> 17:12.847
Yeah.

17:12.928 --> 17:13.388
Terrible.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.672
The other one, the coup.

17:15.692 --> 17:16.893
The coup from Africa, yeah.

17:17.074 --> 17:17.975
Terrible, you know.

17:18.956 --> 17:20.458
What can you say?

17:20.478 --> 17:21.640
He just wants... Yeah.

17:22.381 --> 17:24.945
But... Anyway, Jack, I think we... Do you have enough?

17:24.965 --> 17:25.546
Do you have enough?

17:26.227 --> 17:26.868
I'll give that to you.

17:26.888 --> 17:27.448
You're close.

17:27.769 --> 17:29.271
So if I have any questions...
