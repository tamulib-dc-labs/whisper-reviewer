00:03.423 --> 00:27.793
I think it's very important to point out that this is a museum.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.134
that we're in, this part here, as a museum.

00:30.154 --> 00:34.499
This is not a library, per se, and I think we should take this all in the context of what it is.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.022
Do you think that's an important distinction?

00:37.042 --> 00:44.171
No, and this has always been the problem of which are we, what are we, and we're not just libraries.

00:44.191 --> 00:49.758
And Dobie left this little ranch house, Paisano.

00:50.239 --> 00:53.663
Interesting, she called his ranch Paisano and said,

00:54.908 --> 00:58.914
to the university for six months fellowship.

00:58.934 --> 01:10.731
If you created anyone, you could be a composer, a potter, a weaver, a writer, and go for six months and leave and go to college.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.182
That's wonderful.

01:18.466 --> 01:20.489
That's what it is.

01:20.889 --> 01:23.352
Well, why not?

01:23.432 --> 01:24.814
Look at this.

01:25.135 --> 01:29.280
And this is Rosa Bonheur, if you can believe it, 19th century plan.

01:31.203 --> 01:35.889
But somebody gave it to Dobie's cousin.

01:35.909 --> 01:35.969
No.

01:35.989 --> 01:38.893
I finally learned the difference.

01:39.594 --> 01:41.897
That is Dobie's chair, the little swivel.

01:42.317 --> 01:42.818
Uh-huh.

01:44.119 --> 01:48.045
That is a very particular kind called a TV horn chair.

01:48.265 --> 01:48.405
Uh-huh.

01:50.157 --> 01:53.663
which people made because they had no wood.

01:53.683 --> 01:56.809
This is the Caldwell Collection.

01:58.232 --> 02:02.259
There's probably a first edition of every rest of the book that's been written.

02:02.279 --> 02:02.640
Really?

02:02.660 --> 02:03.922
Between the two.

02:03.942 --> 02:13.920
The Caldwell Collection is primarily all the records of the Texas counties and encyclopedic information about Texas.

02:15.082 --> 02:18.977
Y'all did everything he made Western media to expect me.

02:19.057 --> 02:22.290
Before W, all he had was right with me.

02:27.839 --> 02:31.503
L-A-R-O-C-3-E-Tinker, T-A-N-K-E-F Library.

02:31.523 --> 02:34.487
He was a packet boat captain, he was an attorney, went to El Paso.

02:34.627 --> 02:36.109
A packet boat captain, huh?

02:36.129 --> 02:40.053
He went to, lived in El Paso just when Poncho Villa was marching on the parade.

02:40.073 --> 02:44.258
He got on his horse, he rode across the river, he lived in Poncho Villa for three weeks.

02:44.278 --> 02:49.684
He was going in the Bide he loved for, Gouchos, the Carols, and the Calvary.

02:49.704 --> 02:51.967
And the rest of his lives, collecting his materials.

02:52.688 --> 02:56.412
He bought 28 saddles at the William Randolph Hearst, Rose Bay.

02:56.932 --> 02:57.553
Oh.

03:00.817 --> 03:01.497
Okay.

03:01.517 --> 03:05.122
There are seven books in Spanish, seven in French.

03:05.622 --> 03:06.403
These are his books?

03:07.725 --> 03:08.145
Many.

03:08.165 --> 03:15.153
If you have anybody who wants to discover an untranslated Spanish document.

03:15.173 --> 03:16.495
It's here.

03:17.816 --> 03:26.667
The formal curator sent years trans-dropping with a bunch of his letters, and the family did not laugh.

03:26.707 --> 03:26.787
Hmm.

03:28.437 --> 03:30.200
Do we have any Pancho Villa stuff here?

03:31.101 --> 03:31.882
All his letters.

03:31.902 --> 03:33.324
We have all Pancho Villa's letters.

03:33.544 --> 03:36.609
I don't know whether they're all of them or not, but she spent years doing that.

03:36.789 --> 03:37.991
But the originals are here?

03:38.371 --> 03:38.932
The originals, yes.

03:39.373 --> 03:40.034
She bought them.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.238
I'm sure Pancho Villa needed money.

03:45.341 --> 03:46.583
That's why I came to El Paso.

03:46.603 --> 03:49.467
It's not easy to run a revolution.

03:49.683 --> 04:06.523
We have a film of the most beautiful black horse and Brazilian man doing their size together in Covet Garden, London, on this side.

04:06.543 --> 04:11.769
And most of these are of 1885 to early 1900s.

04:12.250 --> 04:17.496
A lot of the silver accents, this one is Latin American.

04:19.113 --> 04:27.163
Okay, we're on.

04:28.865 --> 04:32.009
Maybe you can just quickly identify yourself for the sake of the tape.

04:33.070 --> 04:38.357
I'm Mike Weil, and my academic background is in history.

04:38.377 --> 04:40.479
And I am associate director of the Ransom Center.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.444
I moved here in late May, just last year.

04:44.644 --> 04:46.707
So I'm still kind of finding my way around.

04:48.188 --> 04:56.419
Much of what Connie and I are doing for this book that I'm writing, of course, is on the formation of this great library.

04:56.439 --> 05:02.366
I don't know how much of that you can speak to, but I guess you can tell us a little bit about what you're doing.

05:04.589 --> 05:05.250
Go ahead.

05:05.390 --> 05:08.474
Three or four tasks that don't seem to be very much related.

05:08.594 --> 05:14.702
One is to try to raise money from private foundations and governmental agencies.

05:15.661 --> 05:22.009
HRC in typical Texas fashion, never had to worry about that, and so on, we're that good at it.

05:22.129 --> 05:27.375
And it will not be, in the long run, hard to get good at it because of the resources that you have.

05:27.515 --> 05:29.537
You either have the collections or you don't, and you do.

05:30.338 --> 05:40.651
So that's one concern, and clearly we're going to have to get into that in a big way, and indeed already have submitted a lot of proposals and a lot of things off the ground.

05:40.671 --> 05:43.474
Okay, so you're giving me a question after that.

05:44.568 --> 05:59.271
From the beginning, when Dr. Lanson's vision was articulated to the regions and to the people, money was never apparently any problem.

05:59.291 --> 06:02.476
Not compared to any other university in the country.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.499
How about now?

06:04.519 --> 06:05.300
Oh, we're not poor.

06:05.961 --> 06:11.790
I'd say our acquisitions budget is still very strong compared almost anywhere.

06:12.395 --> 06:18.061
It's kind of hard to siphon that out because nobody is actually willing to mention hard figures very often.

06:18.081 --> 06:22.505
But still, I don't think we're poor at all, but we clearly are not throwing money around.

06:22.525 --> 06:30.413
I don't mean to back you into a point, but you bring figures of $2 million a year.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.454
Are you at that level?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.455
No, I'm close.

06:32.735 --> 06:34.356
Far lower now.

06:34.376 --> 06:35.818
There was a time when we were above it.

06:36.879 --> 06:38.600
About $2 million.

06:38.621 --> 06:40.542
How high or how far was that?

06:40.562 --> 06:41.203
Significantly.

06:43.192 --> 06:45.916
Do you mean that might have changed?

06:46.156 --> 07:01.317
I actually don't have a clear sense of when the money ran out, but I mean, you're talking perhaps a better part of a decade ago, certainly really mid-80s, when the oil boom collapsed.

07:01.337 --> 07:04.321
So it's definitely connected.

07:04.441 --> 07:06.063
Oh, sure, sure, of course.

07:06.524 --> 07:10.870
So now, all of a sudden, you have to go out and...

07:11.508 --> 07:14.271
Well, that's right.

07:14.331 --> 07:16.133
And we should have been doing it all along.

07:16.734 --> 07:24.522
The HRC has a track record of acquiring marvelous collections and not taking as much care of them as we really ought to.

07:24.582 --> 07:25.223
And we know that.

07:25.663 --> 07:28.726
I mean, I don't think that's the secret.

07:28.746 --> 07:35.574
I think we've done well with the resources we have in terms of cataloging and making materials available to the scholars.

07:35.594 --> 07:39.658
But we have a lot of materials that either need more work or that

07:40.297 --> 07:44.421
that have seen the sessions drifting over the years where we're not quite as clear as we ought to be.

07:44.461 --> 07:46.843
We ought to be on national utilities, and we're not.

07:48.604 --> 07:58.313
Oh, either Arlen or OCLC, so that a scholar at Princeton or UCLA can easily find out what we've got in our collections.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.195
No, there's a database that people can collect.

08:00.215 --> 08:02.217
National database is one way of looking at it.

08:02.237 --> 08:06.040
Yeah, we're not on one yet, although we will be within the year.

08:06.060 --> 08:09.443
There was a tendency, in short,

08:10.385 --> 08:20.878
not to digest the acquisitions as thoroughly as a smaller library with less ambitious goals probably could do.

08:21.238 --> 08:28.026
And in a way, I'm sympathetic to the problems the Ransom Center had.

08:28.046 --> 08:30.369
There is no right time to acquire anything.

08:30.389 --> 08:32.912
I mean, you acquire it when you have the money and when it's available.

08:32.992 --> 08:37.658
Those are the parameters, not whether it's convenient for you or whether you have the catalogers

08:40.658 --> 08:42.920
to pick it up online immediately.

08:44.442 --> 08:52.009
But one thing that's kind of exciting about HRC, historically, is it was acquired when they worried about the money.

08:52.909 --> 08:55.172
I mean, they knew the money would be there.

08:55.272 --> 08:59.315
And if the time of the amendment was, get it.

08:59.576 --> 09:02.038
Get it while it's there.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.139
That's correct, yes.

09:04.140 --> 09:07.543
I mean, what I'm saying isâ€” Ransom, particularly, I think that was his philosophy.

09:08.148 --> 09:15.995
And yet it was just true as well of the other directors who preceded Tom, near as I can gather.

09:16.996 --> 09:18.237
And to a degree, it still is.

09:18.297 --> 09:23.041
I mean, if we came up with a really wowser collection, I think you would go over and talk to them.

09:23.061 --> 09:24.283
Well, I wouldn't say that.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.044
I mean, that's presumptive.

09:26.064 --> 09:31.469
But we would go over to the president and say, you know, how serious are you about being really great?

09:31.489 --> 09:34.772
And if you are, this is, we've got to have this collection.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.233
And he would listen.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.155
And that happened in...

09:38.472 --> 09:39.033
Yeah.

09:39.173 --> 09:44.097
Is it going to be an example?

09:44.178 --> 09:47.941
No, but it's happened.

09:49.743 --> 10:00.133
I think Texans are willing to back up their ambitions with money, and that's really what you're talking about.

10:00.413 --> 10:04.037
I think in terms of quotations, I see that one right there.

10:04.057 --> 10:05.758
That's a good one.

10:05.898 --> 10:06.779
Are you Texan?

10:06.859 --> 10:07.500
No, I'm not.

10:08.088 --> 10:13.016
I was born and raised and educated in New England.

10:13.277 --> 10:14.358
In Maine, mostly.

10:14.438 --> 10:15.360
Where did you go to school?

10:15.420 --> 10:16.241
I went to Bates.

10:16.261 --> 10:16.662
Oh, did you?

10:16.682 --> 10:17.503
I went to Bowdoin.

10:17.524 --> 10:18.225
Right here.

10:18.766 --> 10:19.467
Sixty-three.

10:20.388 --> 10:21.049
Sixty-five.

10:21.069 --> 10:22.372
You're a young kid.

10:22.412 --> 10:23.053
What are you now?

10:23.273 --> 10:24.475
Those are very wicked.

10:24.655 --> 10:25.417
Oh, terrible.

10:25.437 --> 10:28.421
There's no such thing as a good one.

10:28.562 --> 10:32.408
My nephew and his wife live in Thompson, which is across the

10:33.164 --> 10:36.449
They got 28 inches of snow in 24 hours the other day.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.452
And I said, this is wonderful.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.255
I don't ever want to see snow again.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.396
I go up for Christmas.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.620
We had that storm as rain.

10:44.181 --> 10:44.501
Yeah.

10:47.486 --> 10:49.549
So you trained as?

10:50.470 --> 10:51.171
As an historian.

10:51.291 --> 10:51.932
As an historian.

10:51.952 --> 10:52.173
Right.

10:53.975 --> 10:58.081
Where I became acquainted with Tom was that we were in administration together in Tulsa.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.444
He was dean.

10:59.464 --> 11:00.445
I was associate dean.

11:00.545 --> 11:01.487
And he was provost.

11:01.507 --> 11:02.428
I was vice provost.

11:03.387 --> 11:09.275
And so I got a chance to move down to a university about 10 times as I've developed.

11:10.256 --> 11:14.882
And I think it's a good thing to change jobs once in a while.

11:15.363 --> 11:18.587
And this is certainly a change of being in the classroom.

11:18.607 --> 11:19.288
And it's intriguing.

11:19.308 --> 11:22.051
I mean, you never know what you're going to run into.

11:22.071 --> 11:24.074
There are just all sorts of things.

11:24.094 --> 11:26.677
What do you mean by that?

11:27.018 --> 11:30.222
Oh, there are three or four punchlines I've developed over the months.

11:30.421 --> 11:35.587
They have a big Harry Houdini collection, of course, and the punchline on that is that it's always disappearing.

11:35.688 --> 11:36.869
No one can never find it.

11:36.889 --> 11:38.211
Actually, it isn't disappearing.

11:38.231 --> 11:38.651
It's around.

11:40.213 --> 11:42.917
Is that Houdini's collection of artifacts or books?

11:42.937 --> 11:44.499
I think he was quite a great collector.

11:44.559 --> 11:45.280
Yes.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.221
Both, I believe.

11:46.261 --> 11:47.562
But there are some artifacts.

11:48.043 --> 11:51.127
I've never bothered to really get into it, so I don't know.

11:51.147 --> 11:56.153
It's funny because one of the collectors I'll be interviewing is the magician Ricky Jay.

11:56.273 --> 11:58.256
Have you ever heard of him again?

11:58.456 --> 11:59.297
But apparently he has

11:59.598 --> 12:15.161
I mean, there may be other collections, but we're supposed to have a big one.

12:15.682 --> 12:27.259
And it took me a while, and as somebody trained in pretty traditional ways, it took me for a while, first of all, to break through the book.

12:27.728 --> 12:34.535
psychology, which is relatively easy, and then manuscripts, so that's okay, that's easy too.

12:34.555 --> 12:44.845
Most people associate libraries with books, to the exclusion of other impressive movements, and clearly in the HRC manuscripts.

12:45.486 --> 12:46.127
Sure.

12:46.147 --> 12:47.068
Well, that's right.

12:47.308 --> 12:52.453
But it takes a while to observe the fact that, or to conclude, based on our

12:54.458 --> 13:19.200
that way about the hrc scholars do and this is a primary resource facility yes we come here to do primary research right right and i think when people suggest that you know i don't know what the percentage is that are catalogued they don't understand but you're dealing with stuff that's really coming in raw

13:19.450 --> 13:21.092
It is not.

13:21.412 --> 13:24.235
Even the books are not easy.

13:24.255 --> 13:29.179
It takes a considerable length of time to catalog a rare book.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.942
And manuscripts could be even trickier.

13:32.883 --> 13:36.727
The Selznick collection here is the biggest, and I suppose it's the most famous example.

13:36.747 --> 13:38.128
But there are others in my picture.

13:38.248 --> 13:39.589
Example of what?

13:39.609 --> 13:44.054
Just something by the sheer size of it being baffling even the professional catalog.

13:44.334 --> 13:46.156
Selznick's 6,000 linear feet.

13:47.096 --> 13:48.698
Some presidents haven't left that much.

13:49.167 --> 13:50.528
And he kept everything.

13:50.568 --> 13:53.351
And that's wonderful for people who are doing research.

13:54.032 --> 13:55.233
But nonetheless, yeah.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.054
Well, it is.

13:56.194 --> 13:56.954
Yes, it is.

13:56.974 --> 14:03.501
It's kind of like the box level now and will be by the end of the file level by the end of the year.

14:03.721 --> 14:05.883
And it's a tremendous corpus of material.

14:07.645 --> 14:15.152
And yet, the average person, the average academic could not begin to put it in a manageable shape.

14:15.172 --> 14:18.415
You have to begin to train darkness.

14:18.985 --> 14:21.748
And you have to have the electronic tools to be able to do it.

14:21.768 --> 14:22.890
You cannot do it with paper.

14:23.190 --> 14:23.611
It's too big.

14:23.631 --> 14:28.357
Is this kind of what you're working on in addition to the money?

14:28.697 --> 14:34.324
Yeah, I'm very interested in automation, the general subject of automation.

14:34.344 --> 14:36.006
I think it's important for HRC.

14:36.086 --> 14:40.492
It's important for us to manage what we do in the community, what we do to the scholarly world.

14:40.552 --> 14:43.896
So yeah, that is another major concern of mine.

14:44.298 --> 14:52.330
And manuscripts are as well, because we tended to be slow in cataloging them, right, just because of the sheer size of holdings.

14:53.371 --> 14:57.457
And we hired a new head of the manuscripts department, and she's very bright.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.040
She's going to be good.

14:59.060 --> 15:02.805
And so I think we're going to turn that around quickly.

15:03.506 --> 15:10.677
Yet I know from using manuscripts as a scholar that an incompletely

15:13.070 --> 15:16.754
performed cataloging is worse than none in some ways.

15:17.115 --> 15:20.038
In other words, it has to be properly done.

15:20.058 --> 15:21.179
It has to be useful.

15:21.199 --> 15:25.684
And that's something I think we get good service on.

15:25.744 --> 15:29.328
I think what we do is, on the whole, is done well.

15:29.669 --> 15:31.791
But there is still much to do.

15:32.092 --> 15:36.196
And there are still plenty of acquisitions coming in the door.

15:36.296 --> 15:38.919
I mean, it's not like we've stopped buying at all.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.283
And that gets to be a question we have to

15:42.803 --> 15:45.527
constantly investigate our priorities.

15:45.547 --> 15:48.071
What is at the top of the list to be done next?

15:48.091 --> 15:49.333
And do we revise that?

15:49.453 --> 15:53.258
And that has not been the psychology.

15:53.298 --> 15:59.307
The psychology was essentially, since we have a lot of money, we don't really have to worry about prioritizing.

15:59.327 --> 16:01.971
It's just not part of our scene.

16:01.991 --> 16:11.325
We therefore would continue to be concerned about acquiring, rather than the emphasis of other business.

16:11.693 --> 16:16.059
not naming me cataloging and getting me available for scholars.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.102
Now, you're not from Texas?

16:18.442 --> 16:18.642
No.

16:18.662 --> 16:19.564
You can't be at Tulsa.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.767
We're in New England, by the way, in your family?

16:21.787 --> 16:23.529
My mother lives in Kennewell, in Maine.

16:23.549 --> 16:24.010
Oh, so you are?

16:24.070 --> 16:27.014
And I grew up in Waterloo, yeah.

16:27.034 --> 16:28.296
Well, you should have gone.

16:28.316 --> 16:29.637
You can go to Colby.

16:29.657 --> 16:30.979
My dad worked at Colby.

16:30.999 --> 16:32.762
He's the superintendent of the Lins and Grands There.

16:32.802 --> 16:36.006
So I know that I live on that campus and know it well, but no.

16:36.647 --> 16:40.452
Well, my point is you're a New England guy, and you just

16:40.921 --> 16:42.563
came to Texas nine months ago.

16:42.583 --> 16:47.489
I know you were in charge of going out and developing a government.

16:47.509 --> 16:50.893
Oh, the National Foundation is a governmental agency in Texas.

16:51.153 --> 16:55.078
The University of Texas at Austin is, you know, it speaks for itself.

16:55.158 --> 16:58.022
I don't think they get a name any more than that.

16:58.042 --> 17:02.907
I mean, it's... Are you dealing with individuals, like private kind of things?

17:02.927 --> 17:06.632
Less that than governmental agencies at this stage, although we've done some of that.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.435
We will do that eventually.

17:09.796 --> 17:10.436
Yeah.

17:10.577 --> 17:10.877
We're...

17:12.697 --> 17:21.066
I think it's necessary, particularly to get lines on people who are interested in certain subjects where we might be acquiring in a few years.

17:21.487 --> 17:25.672
And obviously, we're going to need some private help to do that, as we have always had.

17:26.413 --> 17:33.661
This operation, as someone may have explained to you along the way, is not funded simply on state lines.

17:33.681 --> 17:40.689
In fact, that in terms of annual appropriations from the legislature is one of the rather less significant issues.

17:40.709 --> 17:41.910
Have you been to many of the great

17:42.211 --> 17:45.156
in the United States?

17:45.516 --> 17:49.583
As a working scholar, I suppose I've been to most of them.

17:53.388 --> 17:54.210
I'm trying to think.

17:54.290 --> 17:58.857
I've been on Stanford's campus, but never to the library.

17:58.877 --> 18:04.105
Huntington, Bancroft, Newbury, Harvard, Yale, Princeton.

18:04.125 --> 18:04.366
Sure.

18:04.386 --> 18:06.409
So what's your reaction to that?

18:06.429 --> 18:09.113
How did this place stand apart in your mind?

18:10.190 --> 18:17.056
Yes, it's more diverse in its holdings.

18:17.476 --> 18:23.201
It acquired all of its holdings relatively recently, which is not true for most of those libraries.

18:24.122 --> 18:31.549
It is decidedly a 20th century repository for appropriate reasons, I think.

18:33.450 --> 18:39.015
In some respects, it's pretty much like any other place.

18:40.396 --> 18:49.868
I think perhaps one of the separating characteristics beyond the diversity is simply that the expertise of the HRC is actually split in many areas.

18:49.948 --> 18:56.256
I mean, photography is very good, and books and manuscripts, and even the artwork you saw.

18:56.276 --> 18:58.098
I mean, here's some important pieces over there.

18:58.258 --> 19:01.743
It's simply more diverse than you would expect most places to be.

19:01.763 --> 19:07.610
It's more similar to the Huntington, perhaps, than any other cinema or Newburgh.

19:07.630 --> 19:10.133
Well, I think maybe that the...

19:10.501 --> 19:16.149
The scheme of acquisition parallels in many ways what Huntington did.

19:16.169 --> 19:19.193
Huntington put his library together in seven or eight years.

19:19.253 --> 19:21.115
People don't realize that.

19:21.175 --> 19:23.298
He decided to buy, and it was unblocked.

19:23.338 --> 19:28.565
The phrase on the block came in to Huntington.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.228
Maybe that had something to do with it.

19:30.308 --> 19:35.475
Well, Ransom had a genius in understanding that it was important to collect for this century.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.719
If you're going to collect

19:39.695 --> 19:41.718
like Civil War materials don't bother there.

19:41.738 --> 19:43.720
I mean, the good stuff's gone, right?

19:43.821 --> 19:49.508
And unless somebody's putting it in their basement, there isn't going to be any more, at least with a few rare exceptions.

19:49.528 --> 19:54.395
But 20th century, on the other hand, is an entirely different pursuit.

19:55.096 --> 20:05.490
And if there's a danger out there, and I'm not sure there is, the danger is that the HRC will become the great monument of the first half of 20th century letters and not the whole century.

20:05.510 --> 20:09.415
I think actually we're doing pretty well in terms of protecting ourselves in that way, but

20:10.002 --> 20:11.827
It's an inevitable problem.

20:12.208 --> 20:19.928
Your strength is whenever you had the bucks and whenever you were acquiring rapidly, obviously, as opposed to just the whole scale of the century.

20:19.948 --> 20:21.713
And you don't know who's going to be good.

20:21.773 --> 20:25.142
We have authors who have totally faded from prominence.

20:25.814 --> 20:26.856
Who are important ones?

20:26.876 --> 20:27.977
Joseph Hergesheim.

20:27.997 --> 20:29.559
Everybody was talking about Hergesheim.

20:29.579 --> 20:31.743
When I came here, I didn't know who the hell he was.

20:31.883 --> 20:35.428
I've run into him at Mankin or the editor, and this is news to me.

20:35.448 --> 20:35.668
Right.

20:35.949 --> 20:40.655
Well, I read Mankin's diary a few weeks ago, and he keeps referring to Hergesheim who drinks too much.

20:40.675 --> 20:45.803
Well, Mankin said that about everybody, but he's excluding himself.

20:46.624 --> 20:48.767
But, I mean, we have all the Hergesheimer stuff.

20:48.827 --> 20:50.289
No one knows who the hell he is now.

20:51.691 --> 20:53.634
So what's incredible about Hergesheim?

20:53.754 --> 20:54.235
I don't know.

20:54.822 --> 20:56.283
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

20:56.384 --> 21:04.251
I mean, I'm sure there is some value because of the correspondence, which was extensive with a lot of players, like Macon and Connaught.

21:04.271 --> 21:05.653
You never know them, do you?

21:06.133 --> 21:06.834
No, you don't.

21:06.894 --> 21:12.379
I mean, Melville was totally ignored up until they rediscovered Billy Budd in 1922.

21:12.580 --> 21:17.364
Melville was a nothing author for 40 or 50 years.

21:18.045 --> 21:20.948
Yeah, you read anybody trained in literature

21:21.518 --> 21:24.362
up through the mid-twenties, Melville doesn't look at all.

21:24.903 --> 21:26.344
You don't even see his name.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.788
It's not even on the cringes.

21:28.928 --> 21:29.248
Unbelievable.

21:29.268 --> 21:40.764
I've seen some books that are catalogues of, because I would collect them in a small way, but I've looked at these books that catalogued Great American Art, and this book would be published like 1910.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.287
Pre-Civil War, Cesar, it's always two years.

21:43.307 --> 21:49.956
There's a one solo in there, which is down here as far as the eruption, Whittier, but they've got

21:50.324 --> 21:55.771
these lists had him, they didn't even mention Paul Miller, the author of The Great American Love.

21:55.851 --> 22:01.939
You want to see stories before the Civil War, it's always two years before the mass.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.341
That's right.

22:03.381 --> 22:05.504
My point is an archive like that, we know.

22:06.024 --> 22:10.050
It is a document of the 20th century, and at some point, it's here.

22:10.851 --> 22:18.120
You don't know, and what's ironic about that is that even when you judge yourself to be correct or wrong,

22:22.336 --> 22:24.599
It's totally incorrect, the one either up or down.

22:24.759 --> 22:33.552
Or maybe it's not your job to judge reputation as much as it is considered an archive.

22:34.072 --> 22:34.853
I think that's right.

22:34.913 --> 22:39.840
I think you can get to the point where you second-guess yourself into the ground.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.883
And that's certainly not my concern to do that.

22:41.963 --> 22:44.347
I have other things I worry about here at the HRC.

22:45.028 --> 22:51.837
What I think you can do is to be alive to certain aspects in the humanities that are clearly going to

22:52.593 --> 22:57.980
are clearly going to call on more attention as the years go by.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.265
I think the film, notably, in that regard.

23:02.026 --> 23:03.969
It's just going to continue to be important.

23:06.472 --> 23:13.702
There are some other things that we don't collect that likewise come to mind, the history of sports.

23:13.722 --> 23:17.848
Oh, we do, but apparently it's pretty erratic.

23:17.948 --> 23:21.773
I'm interested in it personally.

23:22.563 --> 23:28.692
Psychology is always strange because the library is not a stockbroker.

23:28.812 --> 23:40.650
In other words, we don't buy because we think something is going to be valuable, in quotation marks, in the sense of money, so much as we do that we think it might have some importance culturally.

23:40.730 --> 23:44.436
That's an entirely different standard of mission.

23:46.205 --> 23:48.608
Everybody says, isn't X, Y, or Z valuable?

23:48.628 --> 23:49.709
Well, yeah, I guess it is.

23:49.729 --> 23:53.032
If you took it out in the market, but the point is we don't take it out in the market.

23:53.052 --> 23:58.298
Once it comes in these doors, it stays here with very rare exceptions.

23:58.318 --> 23:59.779
Do you do deaccession stuff?

24:02.602 --> 24:03.223
Duplicates.

24:04.685 --> 24:06.266
Duplicates.

24:06.286 --> 24:09.149
The stacks, I don't know if anybody's walked you through the stacks.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.552
They're an incredible place to walk through.

24:11.592 --> 24:14.355
The first day I was here, I'll never forget this experience, go through.

24:15.348 --> 24:18.112
I don't remember what four of it was, I guess six.

24:18.132 --> 24:23.379
There were three two-volume sets of James Bryce, the American Commonwealth, and they all look splendid.

24:23.399 --> 24:28.246
They look like they just arrived from Kanaka randomly.

24:28.266 --> 24:32.813
They're just in beautiful physical shape, so I think it's an admirable book, and take me down.

24:33.654 --> 24:37.259
And they've saved all three sets because they're autographed.

24:37.359 --> 24:42.807
You know, he signed the mark to somebody or other, and they probably drifted in here because of three separate collections, and

24:43.715 --> 24:48.479
And somebody had the wit to say correctly, well, those we keep.

24:48.739 --> 24:52.523
And yeah, we do a session, but we're careful about it.

24:52.543 --> 25:00.349
There are state laws that are, I think, properly conservative on the subject, and so we're careful about it.

25:00.489 --> 25:03.572
And very rarely will be a session anything with any value.

25:03.592 --> 25:06.555
And we're talking duplicates, triplicates, quadruplicates.

25:06.615 --> 25:09.717
You have sound books in 2030.

25:10.438 --> 25:10.838
Yeah.

25:12.440 --> 25:12.760
Yeah.

25:12.976 --> 25:16.402
Yes.

25:16.442 --> 25:24.075
I think we may be the world's greatest warehouse on Kipling and some of those other things.

25:24.295 --> 25:26.880
And some things are unpredictable.

25:26.980 --> 25:33.511
The American Serves editions of World War II, the books that the GIs carried around, they have almost a complete run of them.

25:33.591 --> 25:37.498
I think the LC is the only one that does have a complete run.

25:39.098 --> 25:40.139
And they drifted in here.

25:40.159 --> 25:46.687
I mean, by any reasonable definition of the humanities, it's an odd collection to have, but nonetheless, there it is, and it's valuable.

25:46.767 --> 25:47.868
It's interesting.

25:48.008 --> 25:49.089
It is interesting.

25:49.109 --> 25:52.013
In fact, you can see what they charge, you know, their books.

25:52.033 --> 26:00.442
I know, but, you know, I had a particular blocking book that they published only in this armed forces with the butter.

26:00.462 --> 26:00.562
Yeah.

26:00.582 --> 26:04.106
They're small out of paper shortage.

26:04.126 --> 26:04.527
They did.

26:04.587 --> 26:05.528
They made it.

26:10.317 --> 26:11.779
presses and they tell them in half.

26:12.720 --> 26:17.806
And we have a World War II exhibit up on the fourth floor right now.

26:17.826 --> 26:23.773
Students look at those, you tell them, this is really the beginning of the paperback revolution in the United States.

26:23.793 --> 26:27.537
Students just look at them like they're from Mars or something like that.

26:27.557 --> 26:33.284
I mean, they're attentive to them, but they still look at them in the most peculiar way.

26:33.304 --> 26:38.350
And a lot of times you have books that

26:40.962 --> 26:47.252
that are interesting and curiosities, but also fulfill a scholarly function of importance.

26:47.332 --> 26:53.622
For example, we have several collectors' libraries, Alfred Knopf.

26:53.642 --> 26:58.650
Well, I mean, this is all the stuff he published, and a lot else besides, it's all inscribed to him by the authors.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.894
So, I mean, it's... That's his personal library.

27:02.095 --> 27:08.185
Yeah, and J. Frank Dovey, the same thing over in the FAC.

27:09.785 --> 27:21.081
Dobie was enough of a Texan, enough of a character, and yet at the same time enough of a national figure that these two, I think, merits some attention.

27:21.101 --> 27:24.426
And you pick up those books and he made an evaluation.

27:24.446 --> 27:31.016
Most of them, so-and-so is a bastard, or so-and-so writes superbly, or whatever he felt he wrote it.

27:31.677 --> 27:33.099
And I don't think Knopf did that.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.342
At least I haven't read anybody.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.345
Typically it's a little bit more discreet.

27:38.708 --> 27:42.092
Well, did I miss anything, did you think?

27:42.112 --> 27:44.636
Did I miss anything, did you think?

27:44.656 --> 27:49.102
Well, I think, you know, it's impossible in a brief amount of time to know what you've seen.

27:49.662 --> 28:07.045
As I said, the theme of the place is the diversity, and the fact that the impressive thing to me is that Texas is serious about making the HRC a distinguished place for the long run, and have been good on that intention.

28:07.413 --> 28:09.155
And we'll continue to do so.

28:09.175 --> 28:11.078
It's just a marvelous place.

28:11.098 --> 28:19.568
Well, as I've mentioned already, I found it amusing to encourage some of the British accents around here.

28:19.849 --> 28:20.029
Yeah.

28:20.049 --> 28:25.055
Because this is where I want to study certain areas.

28:26.236 --> 28:29.360
It's far better than any place in England, sure.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.243
Oh, yeah.

28:31.263 --> 28:31.463
Yeah.

28:31.865 --> 28:35.888
And incidentally, the French holdings are very strong as well.

28:35.908 --> 28:36.789
Exactly, probably.

28:36.809 --> 28:38.971
Yeah, Beckett.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.532
Very strong.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.335
And the U.S.

28:43.395 --> 28:45.276
holdings are strong as well.

28:45.837 --> 28:52.162
For the North Atlantic, the whole issue of North Atlantic culture is where you start without question.

28:52.182 --> 28:55.765
Without question in the 20th century.

28:56.326 --> 29:00.289
And the photographic archives is the largest in the university in the world.

29:00.569 --> 29:01.230
It's just huge.

29:02.223 --> 29:02.904
Five million.

29:03.104 --> 29:04.045
Yeah, yeah.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.488
That's almost, you know, that's mind-boggling.

29:07.508 --> 29:08.349
Five million.

29:08.369 --> 29:09.050
Yeah, it is.

29:09.090 --> 29:09.450
It is.

29:09.550 --> 29:11.552
Try thinking about cataloging that.

29:12.693 --> 29:13.734
It's being done, right?

29:14.135 --> 29:14.415
Yes.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.777
And parts of it have been catalogued quite well.

29:17.358 --> 29:29.209
We're trying to figure out how to get it on our CD-ROM so we can have patron access and staff access in terms of many fields of information, of the media, of the print or negative we've done in, and the subject matter.

29:29.410 --> 29:31.892
Everything's going to be under database, so the computer's all.

29:32.716 --> 30:00.040
eventually it takes time because the cataloging is immense but yes yeah it's got to be on the computer it's the only way it can be managed really paper does not work for a lot of my archival stuff at harvard i can't believe how easy it is

30:00.661 --> 30:20.671
We get into that game very late, but nonetheless, I think there's some advantage to that.

30:21.071 --> 30:25.538
I mean, except for obvious stuff.

30:26.699 --> 30:33.687
in accordance with whatever the state policies are, you handle it that way.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.249
I have no interest in warehousing for it.

30:35.349 --> 30:41.416
But on the other hand, no, I don't ever see deaccession as being very active.

30:41.436 --> 30:42.678
I don't think it is an answer to this.

30:42.758 --> 30:46.382
Do you have other state guidelines that I had heard?

30:47.023 --> 30:49.386
This was thoroughly unvaccinated source.

30:49.406 --> 30:51.508
I was just chatting with somebody long before I got here.

30:52.197 --> 31:04.596
But if you wanted to sell anything anywhere, that you have to use the same, apply the same laws and standards, say, as the highway department might, if they wanted to sell off some old trackers?

31:05.197 --> 31:08.162
That might get three bids or something like that?

31:08.182 --> 31:09.824
That's wider the market.

31:09.844 --> 31:10.726
It's not that unreasonable.

31:10.826 --> 31:13.410
They know they're dealing with books as opposed to used trucks.

31:14.772 --> 31:20.601
But the key thing, and this is important for HRC quite out of the context of the state bureaucracy, the key thing

31:21.205 --> 31:23.669
to get the material in the first place.

31:23.689 --> 31:26.513
Did it come in as a gift?

31:26.713 --> 31:31.400
Did it come in as a session by a regular state budgetary channel?

31:31.920 --> 31:35.546
Did it come in through the permanent university finals as a sort of endowment?

31:36.126 --> 31:44.859
The source of the gift, in other words, makes some difference in terms of the way you can deaccession it.

31:44.879 --> 31:51.128
But the state's view is quite properly concerned that the deaccession you handle

31:54.128 --> 32:08.988
And so what that means practically, apparently, as we can figure out, and I want to label it, the fact that we have not done much, and we do intend to do something in the near future.

32:09.008 --> 32:14.615
But what that means practically is that your best bet, in most instances, is to auction an auction.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.760
I mean, to have a third-party auction for you.

32:17.780 --> 32:21.004
Sign at the South of East and Christie's.

32:21.024 --> 32:23.207
Yeah, maybe not those two, but still, yeah.

32:25.364 --> 32:31.170
And the state seems to have no huge trouble with that.

32:32.852 --> 32:38.398
But as you've already pointed out, that's not a really relevant issue because you haven't sold anything.

32:38.439 --> 32:38.839
Haven't sold?

32:39.079 --> 32:40.180
No, not enough to worry.

32:40.961 --> 32:44.325
Inter-system transfers are much easier.

32:44.345 --> 32:49.411
For example, the University of Texas at Arlington has done some duplicates and so forth.

32:49.431 --> 32:51.473
And that's easier, but there's no serious money there.

32:52.668 --> 33:01.698
Well, I mean, let's say you have 40, I don't know what the number is, but you have 40 copies of Ulysses, and the only price went to $20,000.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.822
You know, that could generally seem familiar.

33:05.182 --> 33:09.627
Oh, yeah, but I mean, speaking theoretically, I don't think you sold one at a time.

33:09.647 --> 33:12.350
Well, I was going to say, you don't want to flood the market either.

33:12.370 --> 33:13.251
Right, sure.

33:13.271 --> 33:18.597
You know, Tamerlane, the one that Dick Manning bought last year, paid $198,000 for it.

33:18.737 --> 33:21.240
It was $88,000.

33:22.098 --> 33:22.378
88.

33:22.398 --> 33:28.365
Now, the other one, the guy from California, just paid $150.

33:28.405 --> 33:32.169
That was the second one in a year and a half, and Dick Mandy was out of the picture.

33:32.830 --> 33:47.245
And I think the same thing would happen if you all of a sudden were to... This is from Texas.

33:48.136 --> 33:57.805
Well, it's still Texas, and this is going to be the second biggest state after the census next year.

33:58.125 --> 34:05.692
I mean, this is not in Oklahoma.

34:05.712 --> 34:17.063
The thinking about this is simply different from a state that large, and the economy fundamentally quite healthy, even if it's still digging out of some aspects of the world.

34:18.342 --> 34:20.424
No, very little.

34:20.965 --> 34:22.686
Very little.

34:22.847 --> 34:32.857
I don't have a handle on that, because the arts and sciences generally have done very poorly in that area here in Texas, not because they couldn't do well.

34:33.017 --> 34:35.840
I think they did quite well, but they've done a lot of different things.

34:35.860 --> 34:45.950
And yet, some other areas, the universities, the engineering and hard science areas, the federal funding is enormously successful.

34:45.970 --> 34:47.151
Yeah, that's the issue.

34:47.367 --> 34:48.730
That's the issue, too.

34:49.171 --> 34:51.515
It's not Texans, for the contrary.

34:51.535 --> 34:56.966
It's not that anybody ended up dealing with ideological prejudices.

34:56.986 --> 34:59.151
It's just that people had a part to do it.

34:59.171 --> 35:00.674
And we'll do it.

35:00.934 --> 35:07.548
We'll be successful, because we've got a lot of work here to be done on collections of international courts.

35:07.568 --> 35:08.650
So I'm very optimistic.

35:11.684 --> 35:37.273
What would be the sort of average number of years that a great collection is gathered over, I mean, we look back, I mean, we think of Harvard, of course, and they've gotten bits and pieces over a very long period of time.

35:38.255 --> 35:40.838
But Huntington first.

35:40.978 --> 35:41.218
Seven years.

35:42.312 --> 35:45.276
I just mentioned Huntington and Mike.

35:45.496 --> 35:49.742
He was comparing your collection and kind of focused with Huntington.

35:49.762 --> 35:59.234
I said, that's interesting because Huntington also, I mean, the phrase en bloc comes in with Huntington's entire library.

35:59.354 --> 36:00.736
What's the price?

36:00.796 --> 36:01.837
They would be consigned.

36:01.957 --> 36:07.845
It's a million dollar offer.

36:07.865 --> 36:08.826
That's how he did it.

36:09.312 --> 36:38.931
and daddy i mean they're uh yeah now they're collecting manuscripts and archives they're doing that same kind of thing it's interesting i hadn't thought of it there is one constant is obviously you can't do something unless you're blessed with and those come and go money and i guess when we start with texas we have to start with the fact that

36:39.248 --> 36:51.963
Harry Ransom's vision was energized by the fact that he came along at a time and there was a lot of money available, thankfully, and generous benefactors.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.727
And they gave him the mandate to go and do it.

36:55.027 --> 36:58.592
And kind of an untapped potential for philanthropy.

36:59.753 --> 37:07.522
There were many wealthy people who had not yet acted in that tradition.

37:07.542 --> 37:08.884
But, of course, I believe

37:09.438 --> 37:17.573
It's hard to know that the vast amount of that money came directly from the Board of Regents.

37:17.593 --> 37:20.459
It was not necessarily private donations.

37:20.639 --> 37:24.106
I don't know how much was and how much was.

37:24.126 --> 37:32.762
I found a 1973 New York Times piece, which is interesting.

37:33.215 --> 37:38.902
In 1973, that's the first reference I could find to Harry Ransom's first profile.

37:39.443 --> 37:42.427
There may be others, but that's the first one I could find in the Times Index.

37:44.509 --> 37:56.625
But after 15 years, the Times recognized that the collection, they ranked it with Harvard, and Yale, and the public library.

37:56.965 --> 37:59.408
When did the Hobson book come out?

37:59.793 --> 38:00.694
73.

38:01.014 --> 38:04.258
Oh, I've got one right down there.

38:04.498 --> 38:05.539
Oh, you mean for yourself?

38:05.599 --> 38:06.500
Yeah.

38:07.421 --> 38:07.641
Sorry.

38:09.063 --> 38:10.204
That's about 73, 74.

38:10.224 --> 38:20.816
Right around the same time, isn't it?

38:22.177 --> 38:24.940
I guess, Miss Luce, you've been here how long.

38:25.325 --> 38:28.750
Actually, 25 years this year?

38:28.770 --> 38:29.792
Yes, 1990.

38:31.594 --> 38:34.458
So you were here really at the beginning, so to speak.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.041
Well, not quite at the beginning.

38:36.061 --> 38:40.127
A real exciting beginning, I think, was 56, 57, 58.

38:40.848 --> 38:52.064
I came in 65, and of course, as a very low-length library assistant, and so I was just aware of the excitement.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.808
I was here in school also, and as a matter of fact,

38:56.138 --> 39:00.785
was in one, I guess, the last course that I was taught.

39:00.885 --> 39:06.694
I was in what was known as Plan II, and he was a big proponent of Plan II.

39:06.714 --> 39:14.425
It's just an honors program in liberal arts, where you don't really have to major in anything.

39:14.445 --> 39:16.248
It's just a humanities program.

39:16.268 --> 39:23.078
And, as a matter of fact, his wife is also a college.

39:23.098 --> 39:24.019
I knew you were on.

39:24.944 --> 39:30.069
Well, he was exciting.

39:30.089 --> 39:38.578
He really did get people roused about learning in and of itself.

39:39.118 --> 39:45.405
And his influence was very much felt all over the campus when I was in school.

39:45.425 --> 39:48.588
I mean, he had funny little songs about him.

39:48.608 --> 39:49.389
He was so involved.

39:49.649 --> 39:51.551
This was before we had him as a teacher.

39:51.571 --> 39:54.394
And just there really

39:54.914 --> 40:03.489
was a very pervasive sense of you can learn it all, you know, it's all available, it's just here for the tapping.

40:03.710 --> 40:19.858
And of course that was at the time, I graduated in 57, so that was the time things were starting to happen, and he was also bringing these young professors who were well silver,

40:20.075 --> 40:26.524
and Shaddock, and Carol Smith, and on and on and on.

40:26.984 --> 40:30.769
Almost all, if not all, is, you know, gone now.

40:31.610 --> 40:45.369
But they came, I think, to a magic touch, and it was, you know, I mean, even among the undergraduate students, there was definitely a sense of great things that happened to the university.

40:45.389 --> 40:48.613
But when I came back to get a degree in library science,

40:49.420 --> 40:51.884
after I had grown children.

40:53.346 --> 40:58.394
Some of that, I mean, a great deal of that still existed.

40:58.414 --> 41:08.610
But as a teacher, I will have to tell you that, and I would be quoted in this, I don't remember learning any particular thing from him.

41:08.630 --> 41:12.035
It was just a great sense of excitement, of knowledge.

41:13.718 --> 41:15.581
And it was infectious, I guess.

41:15.601 --> 41:15.681
Yes.

41:16.150 --> 41:20.595
Did you work closely with him here when you came to work?

41:20.615 --> 41:26.802
No, he, at that time, of course, he, let's see, I can't remember the exact sequence.

41:26.842 --> 41:29.465
Do you have a little folder on him?

41:29.485 --> 41:29.585
Okay.

41:29.605 --> 41:39.536
But anyway, he went very quickly from the vice, and he was vice president, I believe, from right after I had him for the class.

41:39.556 --> 41:45.162
He taught one semester of the class, that was in the fall, and I married and left, and I was allowed to graduate

41:45.901 --> 41:51.348
by correspondence, which is the most unusual thing, by just writing papers for the second part of that tutorial course.

41:51.889 --> 42:04.486
But he did have, he had Silver and Errol Smith, all these people come in and teach one particular, one week, and someone else teach the next week, and that's how he finished after the year, and then after that I don't believe he taught again at all.

42:05.307 --> 42:08.632
But, what was your original question?

42:08.932 --> 42:10.995
Oh, did I work closely with him?

42:11.055 --> 42:11.355
No.

42:12.056 --> 42:13.258
No, not.

42:13.610 --> 42:36.202
I knew him, and he knew me, but he was very much, I would say, pretty relieved, up in the tower, and with Mrs. Hudsworth kind of protecting him from too much contact with people who wanted things, either faculty or whatever.

42:36.983 --> 42:40.148
Was he really focused, however, on building this HSU?

42:40.168 --> 42:43.212
I mean, this was really his goal.

42:45.976 --> 42:47.057
Oh, definitely.

42:47.077 --> 42:48.499
It was one of them, though.

42:48.519 --> 42:56.567
He was responsible for building the underground for libraries, and I think it was even his vision to build a new general library.

42:57.468 --> 43:12.523
So, and he had a program for excellence which provided funds for all sorts of special projects, seminars, or there was, I think, even a cataloging project in the art department.

43:13.229 --> 43:17.113
His vision was very broad.

43:17.133 --> 43:24.239
I think the HRC would like to think that it was his special love, and I think this block would confirm that that really was the case.

43:26.201 --> 43:42.696
When you read this New York Times piece, for instance, as early as 1973, you find unnamed people from other repositories being met that his unauthorized

43:43.604 --> 43:47.809
What do you suppose they're talking about when you say that?

43:47.829 --> 43:58.501
Well, I think buying on the... and entering the market, I guess, in the way that he did.

43:58.601 --> 44:13.138
I mean, I've always just heard this is when, you know, that he always bought through Feldman, I usually bought through Feldman, and he died from the London Library, say, in 1961.

44:13.810 --> 44:21.100
which was a sale to help benefit the London Library, which was in dire straits, and people contributed to it.

44:21.841 --> 44:27.870
I think that's where we got the enforcer managed to package it, and then there's other things.

44:27.890 --> 44:30.193
We bought practically the whole, everything.

44:31.535 --> 44:42.670
And I don't know that that's particularly unorthodox, but it seemed to miss people, but we were into things in such a big way, came in,

44:43.223 --> 44:49.610
And, of course, any time you've got someone in a market like that, it does drive the price as well.

44:49.830 --> 44:57.478
Well, at the wholesale in 1911, well, nobody had really heard of Henry Hutchinson.

44:57.498 --> 45:02.183
And he took a train east in California.

45:02.203 --> 45:06.708
And he arrived with George G. Smith, his dealer, and sat next to him.

45:07.949 --> 45:10.412
And they knew who he was afterwards.

45:11.118 --> 45:14.161
He paid $50,000 for the .

45:14.682 --> 45:15.162
But J.P.

45:15.202 --> 45:18.065
Morgan .

45:18.085 --> 45:33.400
But he had to settle for the one on paper, the one on vellum went to California.

45:33.920 --> 45:34.481
And they did.

45:34.501 --> 45:36.343
He and Morgan really did go head to head.

45:36.423 --> 45:39.606
Morgan never went personally vellum across the Greenland.

45:40.109 --> 45:44.474
Huntington won out, and just about everything that he wanted, he got.

45:44.754 --> 45:48.719
And I suppose, well, did he drive up the price of the market?

45:48.739 --> 45:49.640
I suppose he did.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.842
That's true, especially if you got several people.

45:52.123 --> 45:57.449
But I think the library today is one of the great libraries in the world, so does that justify it, I guess?

45:57.469 --> 45:57.909
Of course.

45:58.670 --> 46:09.002
Well, I mean, if you are going to build and you want things, I guess you have to decide how far you want to go for those things.

46:09.792 --> 46:24.454
Now, I can't believe that Texas was ever in the bidding to the extent of that time.

46:24.534 --> 46:27.038
I just don't know who our competitors were at the time.

46:27.058 --> 46:31.084
You blew everybody away from doing it.

46:31.104 --> 46:33.287
But what the Getty was doing was all right.

46:33.307 --> 46:35.030
It's not dissimilar.

46:35.050 --> 46:38.415
And they're doing it with manuscripts now, too.

46:38.716 --> 46:44.265
And I have had three people, and I can name them because they're set up to the record now, and you'll know every name.

46:44.285 --> 46:49.774
Nicholas Barker, Roger Starrer, the Houghton Highland, Bob Knight-Christopher, Roger's mother.

46:49.794 --> 46:55.244
And you can almost take this quote and give it to either man, because each man basically said it.

46:56.345 --> 47:02.175
They said, those who accuse the University of Texas of indiscriminate

47:02.965 --> 47:06.389
acquisitions of really expressing self, race.

47:06.409 --> 47:08.091
That's sort of what we've always felt.

47:08.111 --> 47:08.872
I'm glad they said it.

47:08.952 --> 47:10.855
And they said it, and I will quote them to that.

47:10.915 --> 47:21.808
And this is Clark, and this is where I just started at Emilton Library, which, if anything, is an old-line conservative, but they respect what you've done.

47:21.828 --> 47:25.032
So if they lost out, they lost out.

47:25.312 --> 47:29.918
Strange enough, there does seem to be enough to go around.

47:30.893 --> 47:33.516
I wonder how it felt to be here.

47:33.576 --> 47:38.403
Was it a job on the one hand, or was there a sense of enthusiasm, a sense of mission?

47:38.743 --> 47:41.927
Oh, a tremendous sense of mission, a great, great energy.

47:43.650 --> 47:51.780
I guess in the early years when I was as a manuscript cataloger, once I got my degree, but we'd be opening things now.

47:52.101 --> 47:56.226
There were two, I have to explain, there was a division of the library.

47:56.341 --> 48:00.866
It was in the tower four miles until 1963, all these things were in the tower.

48:01.948 --> 48:07.855
And the place was just overflowing with things as these modern materials started coming in.

48:07.875 --> 48:13.502
And we were also getting older things as well, but not in the end of the quantity.

48:13.522 --> 48:24.795
So when the academic center, undergraduate library was built, the fourth floor of the academic center became the quote academic center, and that was part of a lot of what you're seeing in the great libraries.

48:25.720 --> 48:31.648
and the modern materials for author's loans after 1850 were over there.

48:31.668 --> 48:33.210
That was 63.

48:34.111 --> 48:53.437
Then in 1972, we moved almost everything from the academic center, almost everything from the tower over to here, plus things which were stored in the Balcones Research Center and the warehouses and all over, and basements and all over the place.

48:53.457 --> 48:55.660
So there's been kind of a traveling library

48:56.298 --> 49:02.846
And there was an enormous excitement when we were getting handling materials.

49:03.126 --> 49:07.251
And I was in the older part of the library, pre-1850.

49:07.431 --> 49:09.894
I had to find something on a handling line and do that.

49:09.914 --> 49:10.916
That's a great story.

49:11.216 --> 49:15.061
And I did not know that his widow is still alive.

49:15.101 --> 49:15.922
Yes, yes.

49:16.522 --> 49:16.883
Sula.

49:16.903 --> 49:17.964
Sula.

49:18.064 --> 49:22.069
Well, yes, and you should read The Art of Love and Love of Art, which she wrote.

49:22.437 --> 49:23.699
That's the title of the book.

49:23.879 --> 49:24.860
It's something like that.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.021
Is it published?

49:26.182 --> 49:26.462
Yes.

49:26.662 --> 49:27.063
Oh, yes.

49:27.443 --> 49:29.445
We have, I think, we have a copy here.

49:29.946 --> 49:32.269
I'm sure that that was part of it.

49:32.469 --> 49:33.510
Can we do it once again?

49:33.530 --> 49:34.872
The Art of Love?

49:35.092 --> 49:39.698
It's either The Art of Love and The Love of Art or The Love of Art and The Art of Love.

49:40.479 --> 49:45.184
Her motto was, I aspire to inspire before I expire.

49:47.087 --> 49:48.208
That's wonderful.

49:49.268 --> 49:51.211
I've just been getting this, you know, for people.

49:51.551 --> 50:00.584
I've always wished, I always wished that she would come down here before Ransom died.

50:00.684 --> 50:04.229
I mean, there just couldn't be two more disparate types.

50:04.990 --> 50:08.355
Of course, I think Feldman and Ransom were so different in Ransom.

50:08.375 --> 50:12.721
You know, can you tell me anything about how those two got together at all?

50:12.741 --> 50:14.783
I have no idea what they were doing.

50:14.804 --> 50:18.769
It is of interest, because he almost used Mr. Feldman exclusively.

50:19.340 --> 50:25.549
And there was a grape before and they died within a very short time with one another.

50:25.909 --> 50:27.431
You talk about sour grapes.

50:27.451 --> 50:35.603
There are any number of old wine bookers dealers in New York who say that Goldman had got all the action down.

50:35.623 --> 50:36.344
I wonder why that is.

50:38.066 --> 50:44.655
And you know, his background was so different, I mean it seemed to be so different from Ransom.

50:45.260 --> 50:46.501
It's just really amazing.

50:46.521 --> 50:48.483
He would come down here in his great big sunglasses.

50:48.503 --> 50:49.324
He's distinguished looking.

50:49.744 --> 50:53.147
Tom showed us a photograph of all the old material.

50:53.408 --> 50:58.613
And that's the best picture I'd ever seen.

50:58.633 --> 51:01.175
But I guess he had capital, too.

51:01.235 --> 51:02.696
I guess he could extend that.

51:02.776 --> 51:04.038
Well, he could do that.

51:04.098 --> 51:06.039
And he did.

51:06.060 --> 51:07.020
I mean, that was the way.

51:08.302 --> 51:11.925
So I had to buy at the end because things were getting tight.

51:12.833 --> 51:19.960
and he was spending so very, very much money on materials.

51:19.980 --> 51:33.692
I worked with Ransom just a little bit after we moved over here, and the librarian resigned and some other people who worked with HRC, Dr. Roberts, was coming up to take over the library.

51:34.353 --> 51:35.694
This is all very political.

51:35.714 --> 51:39.938
And so during that end of the summer, whenever there was a problem,

51:40.846 --> 51:50.098
We discussed it with Rain, so his office was then down here.

51:50.118 --> 51:52.902
But then, after that, he got out of the picture probably a lot.

51:52.922 --> 51:57.047
Dr. Robert is here quite a while, isn't he?

51:57.127 --> 51:58.089
Oh, at least.

51:58.109 --> 52:02.414
There was a turner, I guess, was there.

52:03.175 --> 52:04.097
And nobody knows what he gets.

52:04.117 --> 52:06.440
He's in Austin sometimes.

52:06.460 --> 52:07.461
He's kind of interesting.

52:08.774 --> 52:16.563
Well, an unpleasant one as far as I'm concerned, but... Why is that?

52:16.723 --> 52:19.746
I mean, did you describe his arrogance?

52:19.766 --> 52:22.049
Oh, it's very hard to say.

52:23.370 --> 52:28.556
Both insecure and arrogant, the combination that doesn't work very well with people.

52:28.576 --> 52:31.239
He had been put it in the kindest way.

52:31.299 --> 52:38.427
He had been in a one-man show at the Goodwill Library in Dallas, and he had a lot of attention from the Dallas

52:38.795 --> 52:53.035
matrons, and he knew how to take a little old lady and show her around the library and make her feel, you know, that she was a part of this wonderful thing.

52:53.055 --> 53:06.895
But he came from an institution where there may be four or five people in staff at the most to this really large institution, and he had no sense of

53:07.803 --> 53:22.901
He actually used an expression that I've heard, that he didn't want one of the people accused of employing a ransom suit on one of the others.

53:22.921 --> 53:24.282
What was the ransom syndrome?

53:24.743 --> 53:31.110
Well, the ransom syndrome seemed to be gathering too many materials, all of these things.

53:32.272 --> 53:33.634
But he used that phrase, right?

53:33.674 --> 53:38.822
And sometimes, yes, and sometimes he used it as if it were a compliment, as if he was trying to make it sound like a compliment.

53:38.882 --> 53:40.965
Another time he was very disparaging.

53:41.526 --> 53:44.130
Every time I've heard it, it hasn't been very complicated at all.

53:44.691 --> 53:53.805
Well, I think, I mean, I really think he had grave psychological problems as far as Ransom was concerned.

53:54.326 --> 53:56.048
In a way, they were competing.

53:56.169 --> 53:57.270
Under his shadow.

53:57.290 --> 53:57.451
Right.

53:58.312 --> 54:00.355
And he did build this

54:00.824 --> 54:03.928
the theological library into something much finer.

54:04.769 --> 54:14.740
He concentrated on bindings and leaves it up.

54:15.722 --> 54:22.530
And I think he had to raise his own budget a few years.

54:23.611 --> 54:27.996
So he had, obviously the qualities were well suited to the situation he was in.

54:29.107 --> 54:34.635
And I think he really preferred a private institution to be a public one.

54:34.655 --> 54:36.738
He was ill-suited.

54:36.798 --> 54:37.660
Exactly.

54:37.700 --> 54:40.564
Let's put it quite bluntly.

54:41.405 --> 54:44.089
It was not the best choice, I think.

54:44.109 --> 54:49.757
I saw a quote from him right after the book in this paper that this young woman from Berkeley did.

54:50.038 --> 54:57.088
I think she sent a questionnaire to it.

54:58.165 --> 55:10.760
But she quoted, you even have to use up the Poor Simon collection, which would have been a moment for, what's the word I'm looking for?

55:11.260 --> 55:12.322
Jubilation.

55:12.422 --> 55:13.643
Or expression or whatever.

55:14.865 --> 55:18.409
Text him to want something, text him to love and get it.

55:18.629 --> 55:21.913
It's a great quote, I think.

55:22.113 --> 55:25.337
It's not the kind of thing they should have said at that time.

55:25.942 --> 55:30.867
Oh, it would perhaps alienate people just a little more, you know.

55:30.908 --> 55:37.775
Well, we've been involved, or something, during a lot of time, mending those trenches.

55:37.875 --> 55:40.598
It's a very severe situation.

55:40.939 --> 55:42.280
How about Dr. Roberts now?

55:42.641 --> 55:45.684
Did he function well within this system, was he saying that?

55:45.704 --> 55:46.585
Yes.

55:47.466 --> 55:51.190
I think it changed enormously since he was here and in the museum.

55:51.473 --> 56:04.372
administering the library in general, and he was basically a scholar and a teacher with great interest in D. H. Lawrence and so with the D. H. Lawrence collection.

56:06.695 --> 56:20.535
He was a person who, because of the lack of some lack of organization, people were able to kind of grab an area and, you know, make it into something.

56:21.224 --> 56:30.538
have opportunities they might not have had if there was any organization structure.

56:32.140 --> 56:38.830
So, he had both, you know, good qualities and another second.

56:38.850 --> 56:40.212
Are we in my way?

56:40.428 --> 57:04.039
do you have any other questions i can call you uh the telephone makes us a lot closer that's right i want to thank you very much for your time i'm looking forward to you i am too i was just thinking it'd be a good project for one of our interns to look at what we have yeah yeah well he that was a
