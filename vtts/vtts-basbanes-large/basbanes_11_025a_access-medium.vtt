WEBVTT

00:04.351 --> 00:30.443
I warned students that money is the least spiritual of all the courses offered by the English department.

00:31.520 --> 00:39.548
After a semester of looking very, very closely at 200 manuscripts and printed books, what do the students get out of it?

00:41.030 --> 00:41.430
Logic?

00:42.331 --> 00:42.832
Reasoning?

00:43.452 --> 00:44.073
Accuracy?

00:44.393 --> 00:45.114
Certainly not.

00:45.995 --> 00:46.435
Method?

00:46.695 --> 00:50.599
Perhaps a way of looking at a text.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.746
Perhaps just how to open a book.

00:56.766 --> 01:00.970
As I gaze out at this hall filled with bibliographers, my experience rise.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.310
You are good.

01:03.330 --> 01:03.851
Bless you all.

01:04.833 --> 01:05.353
Keep it up.

01:06.235 --> 01:09.480
Just think twice before accepting an assignment to teach it.

01:11.223 --> 01:22.501
We have a wonderful speaker eager to engage us, but this is a business meeting, so please forgive us, Professor, if we transact.

01:24.123 --> 01:29.792
The minutes of the 92nd annual meeting were reported by Pope Mayo,

01:30.413 --> 01:31.855
and published in the papers.

01:33.197 --> 01:39.867
Sunshine, fetched from the blue Pacific, I have basked.

01:39.947 --> 01:45.816
Mr. Barlow has accepted appointment to the finance committee, where his good works continue.

01:47.097 --> 01:54.428
Also, I must thank Marjorie Zike for all she does for us, for her dedication and invention.

01:56.251 --> 01:59.796
Article nine of our 1981 bylaws,

02:00.417 --> 02:03.601
permit the council to elect honorary members.

02:04.723 --> 02:10.330
Two are on our books, David Foxen and E.F.

02:10.350 --> 02:10.931
McKenzie.

02:12.292 --> 02:22.926
A committee of former presidents has recommended Paul Oscar Christeller, whom the council elected this morning, our first American honorary member.

02:24.448 --> 02:29.074
This society has established the Fredson Bowers Award to be granted annually

02:29.493 --> 02:34.201
in support of bibliographical scholarship by the Bibliographical Society London.

02:35.322 --> 02:52.310
This year, the recipient is Dr. Robert Pierce of Alexandria, Virginia, who will essay the printing of Italian language Protestant books outside Italy in the 16th century and their clandestine transport to Italy.

02:54.273 --> 02:56.817
And continuing with the officer's reports

02:57.607 --> 03:04.274
Pope Mayo secretary and R. Dyke was almost going to say damaged people.

03:05.395 --> 03:18.128
That isn't right though, and book thieves are the first to notice how much their fun is curtailed as social outcasts by their colony.

03:18.148 --> 03:23.213
Now some people have more fun with books than other people do.

03:24.214 --> 03:27.377
That is surely the case with our speaker.

03:28.218 --> 03:34.506
no picture of Anthony Grafton would be complete without books.

03:34.526 --> 03:37.910
Not a book, but B-O-O-K-S.

03:39.452 --> 03:54.630
Chicago found him and trained him, A-B-A-M and PhD, and at Princeton he scampered up the academic ladder from assistant professor in 1975 to professor in 1985,

03:55.167 --> 03:59.813
Andrew Mellon Professor, 1988, and Dodge Professor, 1993.

04:01.676 --> 04:08.104
Of all his titles, the one I envy most is the one he held at E-H-E-S-S in 1994, .

04:12.390 --> 04:13.572
Now that's .

04:14.874 --> 04:19.300
Since his student days, the books have simply fallen from his hands.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.887
Joseph Scaliger, Oxford, Forgers and Critics, Princeton,

04:25.627 --> 04:27.909
Defenders of the Text, Harvard.

04:28.630 --> 04:31.893
Joseph Scaliger the Sequel, Oxford.

04:31.913 --> 04:34.635
Commerce with the Class Exhibitioner.

04:34.655 --> 04:45.325
There are the collaborations, heavy ones, and none of us here can forget Rome Reborn, the great Vatican loan exhibition catalog of 1993.

04:47.247 --> 04:50.490
For Professor Grafton, translation is a trade-off.

04:51.390 --> 04:55.414
Forgery is out in German, French, and Italian.

04:56.103 --> 05:10.022
His history of the footnote came out in German translation back in 1995, but the English original is stuck on Upper Garden Street in the offices of the Harvard University Press Good Luck.

05:10.042 --> 05:16.150
His lectureships are international and various, including the George Parker Winship.

05:16.170 --> 05:23.460
In spring term, he will be a Divner Fellow in Cambridge, where he will be as welcome at the Hogan Library

05:23.896 --> 05:26.340
as he is among us here today.

05:27.823 --> 05:45.855
Anthony Grafton, Dodge Professor of History, Princeton University, on Is the History of Reading a Marginal Enterprise, Guillaume Boudet, 1468-1540, and his books.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.520
Your defenders of the text salute you.

06:00.110 --> 06:06.497
Thank you very much for that very kind introduction, and thank you all for this kind welcome.

06:09.320 --> 06:15.588
As you know, every little boy or girl who's born into the world alive is either a little liberal or a little conservatized.

06:16.469 --> 06:23.957
It's also the case, I think, that they're either a little historian or a little art historian teleographer or ecologist

06:24.292 --> 06:35.626
historians are scared of technology and use ugly handouts, whereas those born into the other more fortunate category use visual aids in a more sophisticated kind.

06:35.646 --> 06:48.322
And I'm definitely in the former class, and I hope that will excuse my resorting to the hideous serographic distortion of the three beautiful books that I'll talk to you about eventually.

06:49.244 --> 06:51.126
Well, the history of reading is hot.

06:51.764 --> 06:57.094
Historians, literary critics, practitioners of cultural studies devote books to it.

06:57.655 --> 07:00.139
Collections of articles contribute to it.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.146
Interdisciplinary conferences stage discussions of it.

07:04.687 --> 07:08.614
Young scholars dedicate their dissertations and first articles to it.

07:09.356 --> 07:14.565
Graduate and undergraduate courses try with varied levels of success to survey it.

07:15.457 --> 07:22.526
The most infallible sign that a subdiscipline has really started bubbling is already obvious in many quarters.

07:23.166 --> 07:29.874
That is to say that the history of reading has become the site not only of scholarly research, but also of scholarly warfare.

07:30.675 --> 07:32.978
From the outside, big guns sound.

07:33.359 --> 07:44.552
Fretful students of past politics and economics and social organization, the normal subjects of historians, beseech their besotted book historical colleagues

07:45.005 --> 07:57.478
to get off the dime, to pull their noses out from between the crumbling, cat-bound covers of their old books, and return to the historian's proper place, the archive, where you can study really big questions.

07:58.117 --> 08:19.365
From the inside of the field at the same time, an even more unnerving rattle of small arms fire comes, directed by the book historians at one another as they denounce each other for the eccentricity of their methods, the poverty of their results, the foolishness of their problematics, and the inconsequence of their arguments.

08:19.666 --> 08:29.922
It would take a heart of stone to survey this scene, something more like Egepico's Raft of the Medusa, the Stool of Athens, without smiling.

08:30.983 --> 08:37.253
Now, in one sense, the history of reading isn't one at all, at least in the world of manuscript scholarship.

08:37.435 --> 08:46.212
Students of the classical and biblical traditions in the Western Middle Ages and Renaissance, for example, have always studied the history of reading.

08:46.652 --> 08:57.553
They've always known that the reading of the authoritative texts from Aristotle to the Bible formed the central activity of scholars and students in the age of manuscripts.

08:58.023 --> 09:08.255
And they've always known that the thousands of surviving Latin commentaries on these texts offer by far the richest evidence about how their readers dealt with them.

09:08.275 --> 09:20.049
Scholars as varied as the members of the Warburg Institute and its two incarnations in Hamburg and London, the Oxford medievalists who for generations clustered around R.W.

09:20.350 --> 09:22.292
Hunt and Duke Humphrey's library,

09:22.745 --> 09:35.678
and the New York School of Renaissance Studies associated with your honoree, Paul Oskar Christeller, all reconstructed ergodite and important histories of reading before the field became.

09:35.698 --> 09:41.984
So, of course, have students of many non-Western traditions, from the Chinese to the Sanskrit.

09:42.725 --> 09:49.832
And in recent years, as the study of manuscripts has begun to become what we could genuinely call more inclusive,

09:50.453 --> 10:05.880
Younger students of the reading habits of, for example, religious women and later medieval Italy have begun to apply the same methods to vernacular reading as carried out in less elevated circles with tremendously interesting results.

10:06.367 --> 10:17.979
But in the world of the printed book, the Western printed book, and I think that's the world where all of us here probably feel most unknown, the history of reading is a more recent and a more tender point.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.402
There's a paradox involved.

10:21.422 --> 10:30.872
Soon after its invention, many intellectuals seem to think that printing had made reading less rather than more central to cultural life.

10:30.892 --> 10:34.095
Bacon, Descartes, and their ilk saw printing as

10:34.396 --> 10:53.361
One of the forces, like the invention of the compass and the gunpowder, that it enabled them to clear traditional authorities from the intellectual stage, to show that one should study not the books of men, which merely transmitted traditional errors, but the grander book of God, the natural world itself.

10:54.102 --> 10:56.725
Printing, which made readers conscious of their

10:56.890 --> 11:25.699
ability to choose authorities as they liked, which released them from the need to memorize, which gave them access to a stock of forms of text so large that no single book could any longer claim to be the work of the philosopher, somehow demoted reading from its once primal central position among intellectual activities, so at least an influential line of argument from the late 16th century.

11:26.422 --> 11:33.732
Accordingly, it took a long time for history of reading in the age of the printed book to take shape as a recognizable field.

11:34.433 --> 11:47.931
And when it did so, in the years leading up to the Second World War, it came into being really only because it seemed to offer help in understanding the seismic shift that historians don't view themselves like an explainer.

11:47.951 --> 11:54.640
French scholars, for example, like Daniel Monet and Lucien Feth, assembled evidence about the circulation of

11:55.160 --> 11:58.703
drawing their evidence generally from library catalogs.

11:59.925 --> 12:22.146
Using the history of reading not as an end, but as a means, they hoped that by identifying all the texts read in Reformation, Amiens, or Enlightenment, Paris, they could not feel their way into a particular experience in reading, but understand why the Reformation had come to that one city, or the revolution to France as a whole.

12:22.463 --> 12:36.446
The subversive books of Calvin or Voltaire followed through the history of reading might do something to explain the kinds of large events that earlier historians have studied in the archives.

12:36.467 --> 12:42.717
Finally, however, in the 1960s and 70s, the history of reading came into its own

12:43.051 --> 12:53.828
moved from the sterile clarity of listing titles and looking at title pages into the fascinating void of texts and margins and gutters behind them.

12:53.848 --> 12:58.596
Innovative scholars began to see and to state that reading had a history of its own.

12:58.964 --> 13:05.171
that the experience of texts changed as radically over time in the modern as in the pre-modern world.

13:05.792 --> 13:17.605
Simple lists of which books had been popular in a given place or time couldn't possibly establish how they had actually been read, what impact provided them back in, how they'd been received.

13:18.425 --> 13:24.432
Pioneer historians of the book advanced bold pieces about the transformations reading has undergone.

13:24.563 --> 13:49.525
The German historian Wolf Englitz, for example, suggested in an influential formulation that reading, at least in Germany, remained for centuries after Gutenberg intensive, that readers had or had access to very few books above all the Bible, read them over and over again, memorized them, committed them to their memories, didn't look outside that kind of handle.

13:49.943 --> 14:16.816
In the 18th century, the cheapening of print, the great expansion of vernacular titles, the creation of new genres of entertaining literature, reading went from intensive to extensive, became the state which we now know, the low, idling cunning of books that one looks at at the beach for fun, rather than the intensive screening of text seen as an authority on life, the universe, and everything.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.579
This thesis was, of course, far too beautiful to be true,

14:20.302 --> 14:26.774
But as Karl Popper showed long ago, science makes progress only when conjectures provoke refutations.

14:27.575 --> 14:36.572
The bold hypotheses of brave pioneers like Engelsing, Elizabeth Eisenstein and others attracted many equally bold refutations.

14:36.788 --> 15:00.568
but eventually once fire and sword had fertilized the ground under them something better began to pop up nuanced case studies which sought to look at reading and readers in a particular place in time rather than to show how reading itself had progressed like hegel's geist from one stage to another close attention to the letters

15:00.987 --> 15:22.287
that attended the publication of a single book, enabled Robert Darden, for example, to watch readers respond to Rousseau, as he entitled, one of the classic founding essays of the genre, tracing in detail the formation of a new intimate relationship among printers, authors, and fictional characters, a really fascinating story.

15:22.942 --> 15:48.882
Detailed analysis of other kinds of evidence, from booksellers' letters to financial accounts, permitted Darden to show more recently that when the readers of enlightened Lyon in Paris ordered philosophical books from their friendly local encore Barnes & Noble, they didn't actually have in mind the philosophy of Voltaire and Montesquieu, but salacious fiction or

15:49.604 --> 15:53.048
scatological gossip about the royal family of France.

15:53.809 --> 16:04.502
Monographs of comparable originality and richness shed light on readers' experiences and habits in many different curious places and cultural environments.

16:04.522 --> 16:14.194
Now, Darwin's studies tend to be aimed to shed light at least obliquely on big historical transformations, above all on the French Revolution.

16:14.798 --> 16:28.842
But it seems to me that in the last 10 or 15 years, the tendency of studies in the history of reading has been like the tendency of much work in history at large, rather microscopic.

16:28.862 --> 16:36.215
Historians, Emmanuel de Walla, do we once said fall into two categories, parachutists and truffle hunters.

16:36.235 --> 16:40.182
The parachutists hang high in the air over a field,

16:40.364 --> 16:46.997
summarizing, synthesizing, not worrying too much about the obstacles that might impede progress on the ground.

16:47.619 --> 16:55.875
The truffle hunters bury their noses in a particular source, sniffing it out, delighting in its particularity.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.825
In the last generation, history has been a discipline of truffle hunters.

17:01.845 --> 17:03.487
I'm a truffle hunter myself.

17:04.087 --> 17:09.733
And book history, it seems to me, has really been a paradise for truffle hunting.

17:09.753 --> 17:21.105
Over and over again, historians concerned with the most disparate areas have shown that readers are obstinately, obdurately idiosyncratic.

17:21.125 --> 17:25.069
Librarians, publishers, authors would like readers

17:25.420 --> 17:34.352
always to process what they offer them in a sane, orderly way, would like to know that what goes in will come out in something like its original form.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.575
But readers aren't like that.

17:36.635 --> 17:38.197
They're cappuccino machines.

17:38.498 --> 17:44.626
They pop, they hiss, they send out steam, but occasionally they explode.

17:44.646 --> 17:52.677
And the coffee that they produce will be different from cup to cup, no matter how carefully you may be grounded and measured about.

17:53.078 --> 18:15.433
From Carlo Ginsberg's wonderful study of Monocchio, the Friulian Miller creating a wild new cosmology from the most trivial and well-known texts like Mandeville's cosmology, to Janice Radway's wonderful study of how a group of American women read the paperback novels known in the trade as Bodice Rivers.

18:16.094 --> 18:20.942
The emphasis has been again and again on the creativity of readers

18:20.922 --> 18:29.152
The wonderful and shimmering dreams of freedom and equality that they weave from sources where such dreams are highly unexpected.

18:30.214 --> 18:35.721
It's a wonderful situation, a bit like witnessing a firework display.

18:35.741 --> 18:41.648
Spectacular, great bursts of light, but rather scattered, hard to make into a single pattern.

18:41.830 --> 18:54.104
This impression, I may say, which I'd already formed, was confirmed this year when I organized and taught an undergraduate course on the history of reading through a group of intrepid Princeton juniors and seniors.

18:54.124 --> 19:01.713
I looked and absolutely failed to find a textbook, a single readable book that could guide them through the history of the field.

19:02.314 --> 19:06.859
But I found wonderful monographs, Ginsbergs, Rathways, and many others,

19:07.143 --> 19:20.302
And I found wonderful help from our colleagues in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections of Princeton, who offered guidance, thanks to their formidable collective memory, into the riches of the collection.

19:20.763 --> 19:23.427
The monographs delighted the students.

19:23.447 --> 19:30.837
They found the particular far more interesting than the general, and they pursued it in their research papers in the most wonderful way.

19:31.058 --> 19:36.205
By the end of the term, in fact, they pretty much ejected everyone else from the rare book of Princeton.

19:36.792 --> 19:49.016
Where one of them sat, transcribed in the notes that Mrs. Thrail had entered in her copy of the tablet, reading riveting details about the street cries that she no longer heard in the London of her old age.

19:49.036 --> 19:50.599
Another worked her way.

19:50.950 --> 20:17.312
grimly but with fortitude through volume after volume of 18th century French pornography, greatly enriching her vocabulary, and the third reconstructed the oral experiences of modernist fiction arranged by Sylvia Leach with the readings and recordings in which she tried to support Shakespeare and Company in his later, more ingenious years.

20:17.512 --> 20:33.531
Two stories below, a fourth student put together an extremely impressive paper on hypertext fiction, with a bibliography several pages long that cites no printed source, but only HTTP colon slash slash sources.

20:33.551 --> 20:38.396
And still fail to convince me of the quality of this.

20:38.837 --> 20:45.865
As the variety of these enterprises suggest, the course as a whole left its participants very much for my own reading.

20:45.980 --> 20:59.032
in a state of happy confusion, convinced of the fascination of individual cases and individual forms of research, but really unable at this point to frame many larger hypotheses from them.

21:00.373 --> 21:15.868
What I will offer you tonight is, in other words, a specimen of truffle hunting, one small segment of history of research as carried out now in departments of history and English, but also in other departments as well.

21:16.253 --> 21:42.109
I hope that it will suggest, more effectively than generalizations could, some of the fascination that this new field of study exercises on those of us who don't have the collective years of engagement with the primary sources of book history to where it comes to more recent discovery, as well as some sense of the intellectuals and more research, telling that these materials from the outside as a historian might occasionally throw up

21:43.203 --> 21:49.268
Now, Guillaume Boudet, my subject, is no longer a household name, even in pretty learned households.

21:49.869 --> 21:53.152
But in his day, he was one of the stateliest humanists in Europe.

21:53.912 --> 22:11.708
The descendant of a great family of civil servants, he studied the Roman law at the University of Orleans, found it hideously boring, and spent several years mostly hunting, until one day, for reasons as mysterious as those of any other religious convert,

22:11.806 --> 22:24.878
He underwent a conversion experience, not to Christianity, but to classicism, to humanism, and began to study the classics of Greek and Latin with a dedication that he never previously showed for any subject.

22:25.598 --> 22:39.771
He rose in the royal bureaucracy, serving as a secretary and ambassador under Charles VIII and Louis XII, retired for a time to private study, but came back to court all guns blazing with the new young king Francis I,

22:40.173 --> 22:49.487
For Francis, he wrote a mirror of princes in French offered the young king instruction on the great deeds of earlier monarchs like Alexander the Great.

22:49.547 --> 23:04.290
Eventually, he convinced Francis to found the royal lectureships in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, which until very recently were always seen as the ancestors of the current political cross, but this argument has recently been called into questions.

23:04.760 --> 23:10.025
As a cultural bureaucrat, in other words, he was one of the great success stories of history.

23:11.047 --> 23:12.668
But Boudet was more than that.

23:12.688 --> 23:14.430
He was also a great intellectual.

23:14.911 --> 23:28.725
He not only helped Francis try to bring Erasmus, the greatest of the North European humanists, to Paris, where there's a wonderful letter, the letter which any academic he has ever had an outside offer must envy.

23:29.026 --> 23:33.931
written by Francis I to Erasmus in very large letters.

23:33.951 --> 23:36.834
Francis didn't use it a lot, one has been fresh.

23:38.075 --> 23:44.822
It's probably the greatest academic offer in history, in my particular game.

23:44.842 --> 23:48.887
As an intellectual, Erasmus Aboudé collaborated with Erasmus.

23:49.127 --> 23:58.797
Both hoped to drive what they called the barbarians, that's to say scholastic philosophers and theologians, from their dominating places in church and universities.

23:59.333 --> 24:01.076
They agreed on a great many points.

24:01.356 --> 24:12.593
They agreed that modern culture must be renewed by making the elite of state and church alike steep themselves in classical learning, the best of Greek and Latin literature.

24:12.613 --> 24:18.322
Both agreed that the church must be renewed as well by direct study of the New Testament.

24:18.603 --> 24:24.632
And by the New Testament, they meant not the Vulgate of the Middle Ages, that Latin text, the Greek

24:24.832 --> 24:45.924
in glosses that turned it into a machine for producing theological propositions, rather they meant the plain Greek New Testament read as a historical record, simple, stark, and powerful of the life and deeds and sufferings of Jesus and his disciples as a model for a moral Christian life in their own time.

24:47.206 --> 24:51.953
This collaboration, which reached its height, its spectacular height in the 15th century,

24:52.912 --> 24:57.057
Brought forth, of course, such famous results as Thomas More's Utopia.

24:57.557 --> 25:03.764
And when this book reached the continent, Boudet wrote a phosphorescent introduction through a reprint of it.

25:03.784 --> 25:09.571
The great French lawyer agreed there enthusiastically with his English legal colleague.

25:09.591 --> 25:14.997
The only way to cleanse society of its problems was to rid it, first of all, of all its lawyers.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.940
It's a really wonderful book.

25:19.456 --> 25:23.761
Patriotism eventually cut the funds between Boudet and Moore.

25:24.342 --> 25:40.562
Hurt feelings, hurt vanity did the same for his friendship for Erasmus who made the dreadful mistake of mentioning Boudetius and Bodius, the great scholar and the publisher in the same sentence because he thought the accidents was cute and infuriated Boudet.

25:41.243 --> 25:44.046
But bad relations with individual classicists

25:44.245 --> 25:48.150
not distract Houdet from his unremitting study of the classics themselves.

25:48.390 --> 25:57.702
Even on his wedding day, after all, he had kept on this customary hour and a half of Greek study, and he retained this habit, I'm not sure if it was a good one, until deep old age.

25:58.663 --> 26:07.134
Houdet, of course, was not just a lawyer, not just a classicist, not just an educational performer who wrote broadsides about the best possible curriculum.

26:07.654 --> 26:13.662
He was also one of the greatest technical scholars Europe had in Europe's greatest age of scholarly eruditions.

26:14.283 --> 26:43.328
His commentary on the Digest, one of the four great treatises of the Roman Corpus Juris, which appeared in 158, was the first effort to analyze that great text not systematically, as medieval jurists brilliantly did, as a treatise directly relevant to the Christian modern society of the 14th and 15th centuries, but historically as a deep and richly detailed record of Roman social, cultural, administrative and institutional history.

26:44.017 --> 26:51.646
His De Asac on the As, which appeared some seven years later, was the first full-scale study of ancient coinage.

26:52.427 --> 27:01.918
Boudet used his calipers and scales, as well as a vast range of ancient texts, to work out exactly the modern value of every ancient coin.

27:01.938 --> 27:12.471
His astonished readers learned that the great order of Democlonies had been quite right when he refused to pay the famous Corpus and Laius before his disperses which he demanded.

27:12.805 --> 27:18.298
40 sesterces amounted to more than 1,750 pounds in the currency, as Boudet pointed out.

27:18.318 --> 27:23.811
And that would have been a far too great a price to pay for a pleasure of which the order would sue

27:25.006 --> 27:36.016
Ode's commentaries on the Greek language, which appeared in 1529, are perhaps his most extraordinary, but also his most inaccessible accomplishment.

27:36.537 --> 27:47.267
This is the first manual of Greek prose usage ever written by a Western, rather than a Byzantine scholar, ever written by a scholar whose native language was not a kind of Greek.

27:47.287 --> 27:51.351
It rests entirely on direct observation of the ancient sources,

27:51.652 --> 28:10.720
and remained the foundation of Greek lexicography deep into the 19th century, plagiarized by other lexicographers from the great Etienne family of the 16th century through Dupange to Paul Benedict Haase, the great German lexicographer of the 19th century.

28:10.741 --> 28:18.452
Joseph Scaliger, a friend of mine, and one rarely given to praising other scholars, called Houdet the greatest Greek in Europe.

28:18.668 --> 28:26.462
And Colton Mack, not in a publication, but in his chimney corner, sitting with his students, not a place where most of us show our charity.

28:26.482 --> 28:38.084
It's true that we don't have a detailed, full-scale life study of Houdet's life works, but that's not because they lack historical importance, it's because it's simply too hard.

28:38.104 --> 28:40.508
Like so many of the polymaths of the Renaissance,

28:40.960 --> 28:46.769
Houdet wrote more than any modern scholar can imagine reading, possibly more than we can imagine lifting.

28:47.430 --> 29:03.074
His crevices in difficult Latin and his personal correspondence in even more difficult classical creed fill four thick, ever-sprewn volumes in the very uncritical edition of his opera Omnia that appeared in Basel in the middle of the 15th century.

29:03.695 --> 29:08.622
Small wonder that few have entered to explore even a small part of this forbidding territory.

29:09.817 --> 29:17.757
Nonetheless, I hope to show that Uday's life as a reader offers great rewards to the historian of that wonderful subject.

29:17.777 --> 29:23.893
Now, Uday always insisted that he was no great bookman, no brolier, no great collector.

29:24.262 --> 29:33.950
He told Erasmus in the letter, I never spend an afternoon prowling around the Paris in the East, but of course he did so in the context of discussing a discovery he just made there.

29:34.651 --> 29:46.081
Late in life, he insisted, when asked by his Italian acquaintance that his library had no special treasures, just the normal books you'd expect in a humanist's collection.

29:46.101 --> 29:49.003
But there, of course, he may have hoped to avoid a request for a loan.

29:49.804 --> 29:53.087
In fact, Oudet was closer to Brolier than he admitted,

29:53.557 --> 30:08.329
He prepared, for example, spectacularly illuminated copies of his books, their title pages and cornucopia of flowers and butterflies and coins and medals for the members of the French royal family to whom he presented them.

30:08.349 --> 30:11.295
Books which were, of course, opened once when received,

30:11.647 --> 30:28.434
clapped shut and deposited in the Royal Library, and which lie to this day unread in that marmorial treasure house of Bibliopoli in Paris, where it's still quite difficult to obtain permission to open them.

30:28.454 --> 30:37.008
Nonetheless, the man who orchestrated the production of these fine specimens of the bookmaker's art was not quite so distant from Broglie as he pretended to be.

30:37.028 --> 30:38.751
He knew the books furnished a room.

30:39.625 --> 30:48.957
Boudet finally was also a great reader, in the sense that Clavier and many of the other great collectors of the French Renaissance were not.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.619
He came for a reading family.

30:51.380 --> 31:07.860
Members of the French nobility of the road, the legal nobility to which he belonged, earned their vast wealth and high social position, their nobility of blood, not by their military prowess, not by their descent, like the nobles of the sword, but by their technical skills,

31:08.144 --> 31:21.917
They were the keepers of the archives, the writers of official correspondence, the overseers of construction for the chateaus of the Loire Valley and the city halls that went up all over France in the first half of the 15th century.

31:22.420 --> 31:33.093
A high level of literacy was vital to their work, and many of their large dark city houses in the Marais housed collections of as many as 500 to 1,500 books.

31:33.494 --> 31:36.598
That's a very large number for the early 16th century.

31:36.618 --> 31:42.505
Ipoda Mirandola's collection was extremely expensive and proverbially large, only a little over a thousand.

31:43.463 --> 31:50.170
Thio's father, Jean Boudet, the new humanist, was an energetic collector who bought both manuscripts and printed books.

31:50.850 --> 31:54.454
Humanist history flanking medieval theology on his shelves.

31:55.095 --> 31:57.557
Jean's library must have been quite stately.

31:57.697 --> 32:01.741
His arms added by illuminators to each book, manuscript, or printed.

32:02.222 --> 32:12.272
Careful notes reporting what Paul Needham has very elegantly surmised must have been a uniform of rebinding and rearrangement of the library in the 1480s.

32:12.961 --> 32:14.944
Jean was no pioneer as a bookman.

32:15.424 --> 32:32.448
Jeubert Tuy, the French paleographer, has shown in work of the excitement of the detective novel that the Boudets were book buyers back deep into the 14th century, though most of their early co-holdings have to be identified by refined codicological channels.

32:32.468 --> 32:36.994
Guillaume himself bought more books than his pessimistic comments might be one to expect.

32:37.514 --> 32:43.589
His collection included manuscripts, especially of Greek works that haven't been printed, and printed books as well.

32:44.371 --> 32:55.118
He read what he bought, he annotated what he read, and he entered his notes, as your handout will show you very soon, in a clear, distinctive Latin and Greek writing

32:55.334 --> 33:02.721
that amfully confirmed the wise comment of my teacher, Arnaldo Mugano, a great man with good handwriting is twice a great man.

33:03.162 --> 33:18.477
Nobody has yet tried to reconstruct Lube's library in full, and anybody who does so will have to grapple with the formidable difficulties that confront the historian of printed books with manuscript annotations.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.000
This is a problematic category, neither fish nor meat.

33:22.553 --> 33:31.020
then such books, even very important ones, often escape the legal eyes of curators dedicated either to print or to manuscripts.

33:31.040 --> 33:41.449
Sometimes they rest unknown in the most orderly libraries, or at least not publicly catalogued, and only institutional and private memory enables them to be turned up.

33:42.590 --> 33:52.358
A hundred years ago, Goudin's first bibliographer noted that his copy of the olden edition of Demosthenes was in the Poitiers of Staatsbibliote in Berlin.

33:52.777 --> 34:10.459
In the course of a year in Berlin, I often had occasion to use the Aldean collection of that library, which is now in the great lurching yellow pile of the second Voiceschafts Bibliothek in the West, rather than the old grey stone pile of the first Voiceschafts Bibliothek in the East.

34:11.741 --> 34:21.113
All of their Aldean books are supposedly there, but the Demosthenes was listed in no single catalogue and known to no single member of the staff.

34:21.262 --> 34:44.135
Only when, by coincidence, I asked a very erudite member of the staff in the old, communist, crumbling Staatsbibliothek in the East, on the last day of my year in Berlin, did she remember an ancient crumbling handwritten list which gave a shelfmark for that book and told me to try it in the new, yellow Staatsbibliothek in the West.

34:45.117 --> 34:50.104
Observers reliably informed me that I then set a speed record for the mile-long run-through heavy

34:50.405 --> 35:06.895
Fortunately,

35:07.178 --> 35:26.318
Great French students of bibliography and paleography, librarians by trade, have devoted serious study to the reconstruction of his collection, especially when we recall in the 19th century and Madame de Renfauré, who many of you here must know from working in the Grand Reserve in more recent times.

35:26.979 --> 35:34.907
They have assembled a wide range of books and manuscripts that belong to him and are now harbored in collections from Berlin and Bremen to Princeton.

35:35.377 --> 35:45.889
And what I'll offer you tonight is a big discussion from this enormous and extremely rich menu, a brief discussion of three for a few days' books.

35:45.909 --> 35:52.636
His copy of Pliny, with Pliny's Younger Pliny Letters, which is in the Bosnian Library concert.

35:52.756 --> 35:55.399
I've listed these three for the top of the first page of your handout.

35:56.100 --> 35:58.583
This is a composite book, which consists of

35:59.002 --> 36:08.791
Talipo Berolalba's 1498 edition of nine books of the letters, Girolamo Alonso's edition of parts of book 10, and some manuscript pages.

36:08.891 --> 36:13.134
I'll come back to the complexities of that at a moment.

36:13.154 --> 36:26.626
Secondly, his copy of the De Architectura of Vitruvius, the one great Roman work on architecture, now in Bibliotec Nacional, or possibly in Crosstown to Tobioc at this very moment, we don't know.

36:26.646 --> 36:27.507
And finally,

36:27.875 --> 36:39.474
out of a local pie, his copies of The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer, the first edition of 1488, which rests snugly in my native swamps in New Jersey in the Firestone Library.

36:40.376 --> 36:45.985
Each of these association books is extremely well-authenticated, and that's not a trivial point.

36:46.184 --> 36:56.239
Even though the Homer bears the words Homerus Budaei on its binding, the binding is a handsome 17th century addition to the Renaissance book.

36:56.259 --> 37:07.517
Anybody who knows American rare book collections knows that wonderful 19th century habit of assuming that any book with German-looking script in it belonged to Philip Melanchthon.

37:07.537 --> 37:10.261
So it's important that one's authentications are good.

37:11.122 --> 37:13.626
Each of these books has been carefully studied.

37:13.758 --> 37:30.467
But they haven't been studied from the standpoint of the history of reading, so much as from that of the history of classical scholarship, by philologists looking for what they can tell us about the descent of classical texts in modern times, or the skills that they brought to their correction and interpretation.

37:30.616 --> 37:48.203
Hence, though well-localized, well-established, and scholarship reasonably well understood, each of those ones with new evidence for the history of reading in the early 16th century, and with moment-by-moment snapshots of the development of the great intellectuals' mind and sensibilities.

37:49.060 --> 37:52.107
Now, all of these books coincide in some ways.

37:52.127 --> 38:06.040
In the first place, they coincide in suggesting doubt about what seems to me a central, implicit dogma in the study of Renaissance books, a dogma which is reinforced by the organization of most national libraries.

38:06.020 --> 38:21.784
That is, quite simply, that you can profitably study manuscripts and printed books of the same period in isolation from one another, an idea as odd as it is almost universally institutionalized, both in library organization and in scholarly organization.

38:21.764 --> 38:40.687
For Boudet's basic ways as collector and reader made clear that he made no such declaration, made clear that no sharp chronological boundary marked off a manuscript from a printed way of reading in Boudet's experience, or I would argue in that of his contemporaries.

38:40.787 --> 38:49.037
If you look, for example, at the very first page of your handout, which gives you the first page of Boudet's copy in Princeton,

38:49.017 --> 39:00.096
You can see that the first initial is filled with a quite splendid illumination document, I promise you it is splendid, representing the arms of the Houdet family.

39:00.257 --> 39:07.870
This appears in two other places in the document, and is the kind of personalization which Houdet, like many other readers,

39:08.120 --> 39:14.832
continued to apply to printed books as his father and grandfather applied it to manuscripts in the past.

39:14.853 --> 39:23.749
Anyone who saw the painted page in London and New York would need no further evidence that in doing so he was following the norms of his time.

39:23.881 --> 39:44.121
Rudei read his copy of the Trivius, now in Paris, with Fra Giovanni Giocondo, an Italian architect and antiquary who built the bridge of Notre Dame in Paris between 1500 and 155, edited the oldian edition of Caesar, and made many other contributions to culture and scholarship.

39:44.742 --> 39:52.690
His transcripts of Giocondo's technical comments and drawings, we see just a sample from these at the bottom of the page.

39:53.733 --> 39:59.372
on, turned the margins of this book from one end to the other into a running

39:59.622 --> 40:16.641
visual commentary on this difficult technical text, a commentary far more detailed than any commentary in print, until Jaconda's room commentary, which incorporates much of the superior, appears probably some 15 years after the time of their collective study.

40:16.661 --> 40:26.912
Houdet, in other words, personalized his books and made each of them into a kind of unique scholarly entrance, as systematically as any manuscript reader beforehand,

40:27.517 --> 40:31.425
In all three of these books, finally, the margins swan with notes.

40:31.685 --> 40:40.162
And if you look at the second and third pages of your handout, you'll see some ridiculously clear specimens from this copy of Pliny in the bottom.

40:40.724 --> 40:46.435
These take many forms, foliation numbers, cross-references, content summaries.

40:46.455 --> 40:48.900
You see a whole bunch of those on the second page.

40:50.062 --> 40:52.466
pointing hands instead of others .

40:53.709 --> 41:01.242
To more sophisticated and unusual signs, like the horizontal lines that you see in a number of cases on page three.

41:01.603 --> 41:07.314
This is the Greek opus, a critical mark of the Alexandrian scholars, which he there revived.

41:08.055 --> 41:11.361
To some quite remarkable individual

41:11.560 --> 41:27.406
and I'll just call your attention briefly to the second image on page five of the handout, where you see a rather elegant melancholy profile of the human face drawn by what was heard to be a significant passage in the original text.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.392
All of these are entered with great care

41:31.709 --> 41:35.897
Not simply substantive, but stylistic.

41:35.917 --> 41:37.800
They're entered elegantly.

41:37.820 --> 41:47.619
Ude clearly set out to turn each printed page into an artistically as well as an intellectually coherent commentary on the text in question.

41:47.639 --> 41:53.650
Now, all of you know better than I that these ways of amitating texts were nothing new in Ude's time.

41:54.001 --> 42:03.415
They're the standard maneuvers, the standard tactics of the reader of manuscripts established over the centuries before Boudet engaged in them.

42:03.455 --> 42:11.927
The standard tactics of the medieval and Renaissance reader who wanted to make a text his own, bone of his own, flesh of his flesh.

42:12.468 --> 42:17.916
The reader who wanted to mark every significant passage in his text.

42:18.402 --> 42:31.922
with signs that would summarize and recall its meaning, the reader who wandered as Hansel and Greggel wandered through their wood, dropping colored stones, marking his text for rapid recovery and future use.

42:32.442 --> 42:45.100
Many of these techniques came to be in the great age of manuscript standardization that Richard and Mary Rouse and others have written about, which accompanied the formation of medieval schools and universities.

42:45.120 --> 42:59.800
In today's hands, paradoxically, they played the opposite role, transforming the uniform printed text into a highly individual, even a unique product, recording his individual response, his individual efforts to grapple with the text,

43:00.269 --> 43:06.061
laid out in a visually appealing and memorable way that would speak to his character and intellect.

43:06.902 --> 43:16.742
The presence of the pervasiveness of marks like these in Houdet's whole library, as well as its actual content, and manuscript, and printed,

43:16.975 --> 43:25.604
Remind us of how problematic it is to shut off manuscripts for infringed books, as most of Europe's great libraries systematically do.

43:26.265 --> 43:34.995
What it will take to get an early look into the cabinated monastery in Paris, once Tobias is running, is a thought that new makes one shudder.

43:35.015 --> 43:37.397
It's never easy, but now it's going to be a nightmare.

43:38.038 --> 43:44.265
Houdet's copy of Pliny makes this point most dramatically of all, because in this case, the text itself is a hybrid.

43:44.836 --> 43:50.589
Pliny's letters had incredible adventures in the 15th and 16th centuries, as some of you will know.

43:51.211 --> 43:56.242
They usually circulated in an incomplete form, only nine books long.

43:56.403 --> 44:00.111
There were a fair number of manuscripts about around, and we could bust a history onward.

44:00.850 --> 44:09.840
But early in the 16th century, another Italian humanist, Pietro Aleandra, discovered something riveting in the Parisian library of St.

44:09.920 --> 44:10.640
Victor.

44:10.660 --> 44:20.351
That's, of course, the library whose Caballon so wonderfully inherited to his list of Derandus' ten books on farting and other imaginary titles.

44:20.371 --> 44:28.900
Well, the real library actually contained a manuscript written at the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century of Pliny's letters, which was completely

44:29.386 --> 44:51.833
which had not only the nine books normally in circulation, but the tenth of Pliny's riveting letters to the emperor Trajan about his service as governor in Virginia, including, of course, his famous confrontation with the members of an esoteric little sect called Christians, who were denounced to him and whom he had to interrogate and deal with as he truly reported to the emperor.

44:52.252 --> 45:04.995
These are among the richest documents we have to this day for the actual day-to-day functioning of the Roman Empire, for the way in which the Roman elite lived and worked with its ruler in the first imperial age.

45:05.796 --> 45:07.199
Alejandro was dazzled.

45:07.219 --> 45:13.129
He was dazzled by the age of the manuscript, which was one of the rare cases when a humanist was actually right to say that he had better.

45:13.835 --> 45:24.549
He was also dazzled by its content, copied it out, sent it to Giralmo Avanzo and Verona, who published it and came to as many of the new texts as he could.

45:25.130 --> 45:26.912
But he didn't exhaust the material.

45:27.653 --> 45:37.446
Well, along came Giocondo and did what the Italian humanists called discovering the manuscript again, this time in the technical sense of the Italian humanists.

45:37.466 --> 45:43.133
Now, what an Italian humanist meant when he said he discovered a manuscript was that he went to a monastic library

45:43.619 --> 46:02.210
whose inhabitants had preserved the book sedulously for a thousand years and copied texts, took the book, often stealing it and not giving it back, made it accessible to other people, denounced the barbarians who had kept it alive for a thousand years, and lent one credit as a great patron of the intellectual life.

46:02.891 --> 46:05.155
And that's exactly what de Kondo did.

46:05.175 --> 46:07.499
He took the book out of the library at St.

46:07.639 --> 46:08.040
Victor,

46:09.505 --> 46:26.675
Eventually, he sent a copy of it to Aldo Mamuzio, who published the first complete edition in 158, and somehow he managed to lose it, so that all that remains are six leaves now around the corner from here in the Morgan Library, identified early in the 20th century.

46:26.695 --> 46:30.361
So it's a wonderful story of scholarship.

46:32.265 --> 46:34.669
At all events, between the

46:35.037 --> 46:37.861
Filching of the library from the book from St.

46:37.941 --> 46:49.037
Victor, and sending the copy of it to Aldus, Jocondo showed it to Boudet, who saw that there were further materials in it, materials in neither of the printed texts, and had them copied out.

46:49.277 --> 46:59.071
If you look at the bottom of your second page, you see, juxtaposed, a page of the printed text, and a page of the manuscript facsimile that Boudet had made.

46:59.311 --> 47:01.855
He filled out his books with the unpublished letters.

47:02.105 --> 47:06.391
So this book itself is a kind of metaphor for Boudet's library.

47:06.911 --> 47:14.521
Printed book and manuscript text side by side, read and annotated in exactly the same way, mean both treasured.

47:14.541 --> 47:19.988
This was the fullest copy of plenty of letters that anybody would have until all those editions came out in 158.

47:20.489 --> 47:25.395
But neither scene is in any way radically or substantively different from the other.

47:26.397 --> 47:27.538
All of Boudet's books

47:27.839 --> 47:36.389
have this same combination of features, the uniform manufactured body uniquely detailed by the owner.

47:36.970 --> 47:50.927
They represent the interaction of the uniform product with a personal aesthetic style as vividly as the chopped down, popped up Detroit convertible of an American teenager in 1956.

47:51.346 --> 47:58.953
And they tell you just that that does something very powerful about the way in which a particular culture of consumption operated.

47:58.973 --> 48:04.478
Now, the content of the annotations naturally matters and reveals even more than their form.

48:04.498 --> 48:13.767
The notes in each of these books offer in different ways insights into their owners' ways of reading, thinking, and feeling that you could find nowhere else.

48:14.507 --> 48:19.632
Now, it's natural that scholars, especially historians trained in the classics,

48:19.949 --> 48:25.338
Look first of all for the technical when they examine a scholar's reactions to an ancient text.

48:25.799 --> 48:27.061
We're trying to do that.

48:27.522 --> 48:37.840
My friend and collaborator Lisa Jardine studying Gabriel Harvey's copy of the work on rhetoric in the Rosenbach collection in Philadelphia took down

48:38.714 --> 48:43.820
every comment he had entered about the rhetorical figures.

48:44.500 --> 48:57.255
Notice that he also told a long story about how Thomas More actually had shown his daughter naked to her fiancé, as the citizens of More's utopia did, but decided that wasn't really very interesting.

48:57.275 --> 49:06.645
He left it out and came home without that in her notes, to be roundly abused by me, her husband, and everybody else, who couldn't have cared less about the rhetorical figures.

49:06.980 --> 49:09.123
But this is how we read.

49:09.323 --> 49:21.479
And the people who studied Boudet's clinic, great scholars, like E. A. Lowe and Rand, who began the work, and Merrill of Wesleyan, looked above all at his inundations.

49:21.499 --> 49:23.101
There are interesting inundations here.

49:23.121 --> 49:29.950
If you look at the bottom right of the second page, you see Boudet reading the words net legevantur,

49:30.250 --> 49:35.179
seeing that they don't make sense, and writing immediately on the margin, negligate onto it.

49:35.199 --> 49:37.723
They were neglected.

49:38.064 --> 49:53.170
It was child's play for somebody like Boudet to see that when Pliny discussed history and said it should be an edema, that this term was out of place, and that it should really be a tema, a possession for always, as the Greek historian used to be said long before.

49:53.555 --> 50:00.322
The list of Boudet's inundations to Pliny, to Vitruvius, and even to Homer is an imposing and an interesting one.

50:00.342 --> 50:03.706
And that's what's really riveted the attention of classicists.

50:03.726 --> 50:15.479
And reasonably enough, the Pliny alone is really an incredible document of the way in which the classical heritage somehow survives, despite scholars' every effort to destroy it.

50:15.539 --> 50:23.528
And what if one of those great crossroads documents, like the Harley and Whippy in London, which both Petrarch and Lorenzo Bava worked on,

50:23.845 --> 50:31.662
It's a point where medieval and modern scholarships, scribal energy and editorial intelligence somehow come together.

50:31.702 --> 50:34.227
That's great technical fascination.

50:34.247 --> 50:37.534
But Pliny was fascinated for more than technical reasons.

50:39.235 --> 50:43.299
today across the centuries as bureaucrat to bureaucrat.

50:43.319 --> 50:44.400
A kindred spirit.

50:45.141 --> 50:54.950
An erudite man who cared deeply about the classics of his own day, who cared deeply about Latin style and eloquence, had plenty fascinated the day.

50:55.550 --> 51:03.157
Many pages of the text are only annotated in the normal way with content summaries and the occasional short comment.

51:03.177 --> 51:08.162
But if you turn to the third page of your handout, you'll see a few of the many moments in this book

51:08.480 --> 51:12.924
where Boudet bursts into phosphorescent, enthusiastic annotations.

51:13.565 --> 51:32.644
In the first of these, you find Pliny's description of his uncle, the great Pliny, author of the natural history, of how he worked all the time, how he always read and excerpted, he read nothing of which he didn't take notes, he was accustomed to say, there's no book so bad that you can't learn something from it.

51:32.664 --> 51:36.748
He would keep little, he would work hard, and you see Boudet writing in the margins,

51:36.914 --> 51:44.386
He followed the custom of the ancients in taking his food, just absolutely fascinated by the description of a model scholar.

51:45.247 --> 51:53.160
In the second passage, which comes from my very favorite of Pliny's letters, Pliny describes how he gave an oration before the emperor.

51:53.480 --> 51:58.508
He spoke for five hours while 12 big water clocks were empty.

51:58.528 --> 52:04.778
He describes with a wonderful lack of self-consciousness how the emperor kept saying, Pliny, dear Pliny,

52:05.045 --> 52:06.707
bury your voice.

52:06.727 --> 52:18.522
And on the left, you see Boudet eagerly taking notes about the water clocks and the length of the speech.

52:18.542 --> 52:22.967
Boudet reads this text in a very particular way.

52:22.987 --> 52:31.558
He reads it on the one hand as the humanist seeking to understand the paraphernalia of official life, the precise nature of laws and institutions,

52:31.825 --> 52:38.014
seeking to ground the texts in their historical context, to imagine them in their three dimensions.

52:38.034 --> 52:49.109
But at the same time, he reads them as someone who hopes to live the life they describe, for whom historical learning is only the preparation for a powerful act of personal imitation.

52:49.449 --> 52:55.999
And we'll see that his imitation of Pliny's, the elder Pliny's practices and readers, is very powerful indeed.

52:56.019 --> 53:00.685
But Pliny wasn't all, but they had to be true again.

53:00.884 --> 53:07.134
The more he read Pliny, the more he saw that he was reading about a society which in important ways repelled him.

53:08.135 --> 53:21.736
He saw, for example, that Pliny, that great bureaucrat and classical scholar, was not only no Christian, but regarded Christians with the amusement and contempt that we would now expect from an educated woman.

53:22.417 --> 53:29.187
In the last passage on this page, when Pliny's great letter happened for Christians who were denounced to him,

53:29.521 --> 53:37.094
He describes the libellus without an author, which contained the names of communists in the State Department, Christians, and divinity.

53:37.615 --> 53:44.526
He describes how he had asked them to worship the divine image of the emperor, and some had been willing to, and others weren't.

53:44.759 --> 53:47.623
Eventually, he'll go on to talk about the use of torture.

53:47.943 --> 53:49.785
Pliny and Trajan were very moderate.

53:49.805 --> 53:57.335
Trajan told Pliny not to pay attention to anonymous denunciations, a principle which later rulers have not always harkened to.

53:57.815 --> 54:04.624
But Goudet, of course, was horrified to realize that one of his beloved Romans was so decadently and sharply

54:05.026 --> 54:06.649
a hater of Christianity.

54:06.769 --> 54:29.025
In the margin he writes, What you see in these and other places is a dialectic between his fascination with the Roman imperial world and his horror at its distant

54:29.478 --> 54:33.524
hating him, the impossibility of imitating him as a whole.

54:34.005 --> 54:49.568
And if others ask, well, it's possible to speak today, even in his earliest stage as a scholar, when in public he insisted, as Erasmus did in those days, that Christianity and classicism could be reconciled, that there were no fundamental contradictions between them.

54:49.588 --> 54:55.637
In private, you see him in the margins of his books, worried about dilemmas that in public he wouldn't admit.

54:55.938 --> 55:06.970
In his copy of Polyvius, for example, in Book 6, which has the great description of the Roman funeral ceremony, which Polyvius argues was the glue that held all of Roman society together.

55:07.370 --> 55:11.274
Boudet writes one word, eisa daimonia, superstition.

55:11.875 --> 55:24.628
And in his will, written not long after, he forbids the days to hold any funeral ceremony for it on the grounds that funeral ceremonies are a pagan, not a Christian institution, not fit for Christians.

55:25.722 --> 55:43.849
It is the great drama of the northern, as opposed to the Italian Renaissance, that its votaries like Erasmus and Ude were committed with equal passion to Christian and to classical scholarship, and that in the course of time, in the age of the Reformation, they came to see that these two aims might be contradictory.

55:44.349 --> 55:54.885
This great drama which expresses itself, for example, in Erasmus' Ciceronianus, where he denounces the Roman humanists at this time for calling God Luther Optimus Maximus.

55:55.304 --> 56:04.304
This drama can already be seen in microscopic form in Ude's margins 20 years before it reached him.

56:04.324 --> 56:08.132
Ude's copy is truly a fascinating quite different way.
