WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:31.658
we have a special situation in Germany as you know with the unification so that we have one organization include two different libraries and one in Leipzig you will see tomorrow and we will see others again for I'm in Leipzig I go to Leipzig today so we can see that again so

00:31.958 --> 00:34.421
And the Deutsche Vertik in Frankfurt.

00:34.641 --> 00:43.291
And maybe you know that the tradition in Germany is a federal tradition.

00:44.112 --> 00:56.886
So that all the lenders of Germany got their own state libraries, like the Prussian State Library in Berlin, like the Bavarian State Library in Munich.

00:57.524 --> 01:11.287
And the publishers started to discuss the question, is it not necessary to have a central library in Germany to possess all the German language titles?

01:11.307 --> 01:12.849
And this happened in 1912.

01:14.372 --> 01:20.081
So this was the foundation of the Deutsche Bucherei with an initiative by the publishers.

01:20.462 --> 01:24.088
And the government came much later.

01:24.592 --> 01:25.233
It's amazing.

01:25.613 --> 01:31.441
It's really amazing, and therefore we have a very close link to the publisher's world.

01:32.422 --> 01:38.030
And then the Second World War came, and it was a divided country.

01:39.031 --> 01:51.207
So the publishers thought, we have had a good idea in Leipzig, and now we are not able to offer all the information potential of German literature

01:51.473 --> 01:54.476
for all the people, for we have the communist ideology.

01:55.437 --> 02:05.528
So they said, we want to have in the western zone, in the American, British and French zone, a new library with a similar approach.

02:06.109 --> 02:11.175
And they founded the Deutsche Bibliothek in 1946 in Frankfurt.

02:11.915 --> 02:18.763
And again, this is very interesting, again at a place where not the capital was, but where the publishers are.

02:19.030 --> 02:19.952
The books are.

02:20.413 --> 02:20.954
That's amazing.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.740
So we belong very close to the publishers.

02:24.722 --> 02:26.606
As a depository, is that what you're saying?

02:26.686 --> 02:27.729
As a depository?

02:28.410 --> 02:29.653
Yes, it's a depository.

02:29.673 --> 02:30.655
A legal depository.

02:30.795 --> 02:34.824
First of all, it was volunteer.

02:36.107 --> 02:37.630
The publishers decided to do it.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.663
But afterwards, it's a law.

02:40.063 --> 02:41.165
It's a law in the meantime.

02:41.185 --> 02:48.015
So the same thing with the Library of Congress or the British Library, or the French Library, where they are required to deposit.

02:48.275 --> 02:51.259
But it's more than just a deposit library.

02:51.339 --> 02:56.847
We also collect all the German language titles abroad.

02:57.708 --> 03:02.976
We all collect the translated titles from the German to other languages.

03:03.445 --> 03:07.030
and all the literature above Germany.

03:07.510 --> 03:13.919
So you have a view to the, let's say, book culture of the German language.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.942
That's the idea.

03:16.402 --> 03:18.826
Not to a nation, but to a language.

03:18.846 --> 03:20.228
That's very, very interesting.

03:20.768 --> 03:29.520
And this is what I think quite a modern view to things, for it links the different developments...

03:29.956 --> 03:32.219
You know, in one library.

03:32.699 --> 03:40.508
So, we're talking, how about special collections and rare items and cannabula and things like that?

03:40.588 --> 03:42.691
We don't have it here.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.354
This is what I told you before.

03:45.374 --> 03:51.681
The cannabula and the rara are in the old state libraries.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.365
They were founded in the 16th and the 17th century.

03:55.906 --> 03:57.668
We are a library of the 20th century.

03:58.643 --> 04:03.891
So you have to add the historical dimension by institutions.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.974
It's not in one institution.

04:06.595 --> 04:11.182
It's, let's say, in a modern way, we would say it's a virtual library.

04:11.843 --> 04:13.826
It's a decentralized national library.

04:14.667 --> 04:21.777
Together with the state library in Berlin and the Munich Library and the Deutsche Bibliothek.

04:22.378 --> 04:23.520
These are together...

04:24.125 --> 04:41.492
And they serve different target groups, and they serve in a way that they can preserve their connections to future generations, but one with the historical dimension, we for the current literature.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.897
So what is your specific... This is fascinating to me.

04:44.978 --> 04:45.898
I didn't know this.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.380
No, it didn't.

04:47.400 --> 04:52.504
In France, of course, there's this whole concept of patrimony and the French patrimony.

04:52.524 --> 04:53.025
Yes, that's right.

04:53.045 --> 04:56.228
And then the British Library actually tries to collect the world.

04:56.288 --> 04:57.969
They try to collect the whole world.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.813
The Library of Congress, 120 countries, they're collecting.

05:02.073 --> 05:05.096
You are collecting the German language, it seems to me.

05:05.116 --> 05:05.376
That's right.

05:05.396 --> 05:06.857
And that is fascinating.

05:08.399 --> 05:09.019
And everything.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.821
It's really comprehensive.

05:11.628 --> 05:13.291
It's really comprehensive.

05:13.571 --> 05:35.931
We made an analysis about the centuries before, the 17th century, the 18th century, and the 19th century, and we found that more than a third of literature production is missed in German libraries, for they didn't have a comprehensive collection.

05:36.113 --> 05:41.999
We have a comprehensive collection of all the titles from 1912 on.

05:42.019 --> 05:45.182
And I think you just said 20th century.

05:45.202 --> 05:47.224
Yes, that's right.

05:47.884 --> 05:51.888
So prior to 20th century, the responsibility goes to those other state libraries.

05:52.229 --> 06:03.259
And the unification then, 1990, was the time we have to think about the two places now, Leipzig and Frankfurt.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.180
What is their...

06:04.463 --> 06:07.008
specific task in the future.

06:07.790 --> 06:13.060
Shall we close one of the places or can we continue them or what's the idea?

06:13.080 --> 06:15.445
So what did you come up with?

06:15.845 --> 06:18.270
I think we have quite a good idea now.

06:18.352 --> 06:22.075
You said it's necessary.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.318
What is the task of book culture in the future?

06:25.338 --> 06:31.183
What is the role of digital publications in comparison with printed?

06:31.243 --> 06:33.966
Book culture is part of my title, by the way.

06:33.986 --> 06:36.848
The whole concept of book culture.

06:36.948 --> 06:41.973
We did a decision in a way which will be much clearer out of the future.

06:42.073 --> 06:47.818
We said if you are a library which

06:48.018 --> 06:59.474
will fulfill the preservation of texts without telling now print or not print, preserving the text for the future.

06:59.915 --> 07:12.372
We said the Frankfurt Library should have all the information infrastructure to enable us to preserve even the very fragment and difficult information

07:12.790 --> 07:20.701
publications on the internet or on CD-ROM or on diskette in the same way like the books.

07:21.462 --> 07:32.236
So we develop at the moment solutions for a permanent preservation of digital publications.

07:32.256 --> 07:33.778
This I hope I will see today.

07:34.119 --> 07:37.623
It's very, very, very important for me.

07:37.684 --> 07:39.526
And this is what we really want to do.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.510
For everybody it's

07:42.760 --> 07:51.015
telling you the shining, wonderful world of globalization and you will get everything in a few seconds.

07:51.055 --> 07:51.495
That's right.

07:51.756 --> 07:56.444
But nobody is thinking about all the problems following.

07:56.845 --> 07:58.187
Well, how about migration?

07:58.227 --> 08:01.393
If you have things preserved in

08:01.795 --> 08:09.425
digital language, zeros and ones, how can you be certain that that will be preserved forever?

08:09.445 --> 08:13.249
I'm not sure if we are really certain, but we have the following ideas.

08:13.350 --> 08:22.842
We know that it's not only necessary to convert a digital text from one media to the other.

08:22.882 --> 08:29.490
The whole context, that means the

08:29.825 --> 08:38.499
programs with the software and the hardware also should be transferred to a future.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.486
And we have now two ideas of migration.

08:42.506 --> 08:53.925
The one is if there is an upgrading situation so that you really can follow to develop one state through the other,

08:54.293 --> 08:57.696
this would be okay, we could migrate it.

08:57.736 --> 09:19.238
But the other idea is to store also the information about the software, the database software and the hardware in a kind of a program so that you can set back the future to a point

09:19.522 --> 09:22.245
where it was working in the past.

09:22.265 --> 09:23.107
Do you know what I mean?

09:23.487 --> 09:25.870
It's a bit difficult to explain.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.552
I understand the process.

09:27.913 --> 09:29.815
You have not to store the machine.

09:29.855 --> 09:33.159
You can store the... The data.

09:33.820 --> 09:34.061
Yes.

09:34.421 --> 09:35.102
The structure.

09:35.663 --> 09:37.024
The knowledge about it.

09:37.525 --> 09:44.414
So that you can... You can symbolize the situation like it was before.

09:44.614 --> 09:45.956
And this is what we are working on.

09:46.276 --> 09:47.718
And we have a European project.

09:47.738 --> 09:49.360
A European what?

09:49.812 --> 09:51.514
a project in this, a European.

09:52.715 --> 10:01.926
We don't think that we, as the Deutsche Botee, can solve this very complicated problem by our own.

10:02.967 --> 10:08.353
So we decided to start a project, it's called Netlib.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.035
How do we spell it?

10:10.055 --> 10:13.258
Netlib, N-E-D-L-I-B.

10:13.759 --> 10:14.740
B as in boys?

10:14.804 --> 10:19.869
It's an acronym, and I have to think about what it means.

10:21.611 --> 10:26.235
It's the National European Digital Library.

10:26.315 --> 10:30.759
Does it have a website yet?

10:30.779 --> 10:31.520
Yes, it is.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.163
N-E-D-L-I-V, probably, right?

10:35.103 --> 10:35.544
Yes.

10:36.004 --> 10:42.010
And we have about five European National Libraries on it.

10:42.175 --> 11:00.786
We, the Dutch National Library, the Finnish, the Norwegian, the Portuguese, I think these are three software houses and two publishers.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.711
And we work together.

11:04.535 --> 11:10.440
to find out the solution for permanent deposit on digital libraries.

11:10.460 --> 11:14.043
And it's financed by the European Commission.

11:14.063 --> 11:17.386
Now, this library just opened, right, basically.

11:17.626 --> 11:20.428
This building.

11:21.209 --> 11:25.253
Was this built with the future, with the 21st century in mind?

11:25.273 --> 11:26.894
Yes, it was built for this, yes.

11:27.134 --> 11:34.120
So with the thought that even though the book was invented, the printed book, very close to here,

11:34.657 --> 11:52.554
You're also at the forefront, it seems to me, in these computerized... Yes, but what we do not want to do is to make a digitalization on our book material.

11:52.714 --> 12:01.002
You see, we have... We don't want, as a total view,

12:01.538 --> 12:07.669
to transfer our printed books to a digital world.

12:07.910 --> 12:20.172
For we say we are a library with a deposit which means that we have to keep the books in the original form.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.465
If it is book culture, it will be book culture also in the future.

12:24.825 --> 12:35.639
But if it is digital, it will be digital culture also in the future.

12:35.819 --> 12:36.800
That's exactly right.

12:37.421 --> 12:47.193
What Kurt Novak says now, this is exactly the model.

12:47.974 --> 12:49.095
We want to have

12:49.531 --> 12:57.420
all the facilities for preserving the book culture in Leipzig.

12:57.981 --> 13:04.708
So we have a big department called Center for Preservation and Conservation.

13:04.869 --> 13:05.730
And that's in Leipzig.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.912
In Leipzig, you will see it with all the facilities.

13:08.933 --> 13:17.563
And they can do mass deacetification, they can do paper strengthening, they can do microfilming and in the future

13:17.915 --> 13:28.349
So that all those things which belong to the book itself, or the book museum is also there, a big, wonderful book museum.

13:28.569 --> 13:29.891
You will see it, you will like it.

13:31.073 --> 13:39.003
So these things are the subject field of application within Leipzig for the book culture.

13:39.023 --> 13:43.029
All those things which belong to the digital world is made in Frankfurt.

13:43.049 --> 13:45.492
But the benefit is for both places.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.322
And therefore, it's the two sides of one metal.

13:48.923 --> 13:59.160
How does the whole process of unification, reunification, work into this in terms of... Political considerations don't enter this at all.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.343
We save everything in the German language, right?

14:01.543 --> 14:01.804
Yeah.

14:01.824 --> 14:02.585
Basically.

14:03.146 --> 14:08.755
Whether or not it was material that was produced in the communist state or anything like that is irrelevant, right?

14:09.456 --> 14:12.441
I'm thinking in terms of the...

14:12.657 --> 14:20.647
We have a full range of publications of all these, all of the former communist states.

14:20.867 --> 14:21.789
And that's all kept?

14:21.869 --> 14:22.710
Yes, it's all kept.

14:23.271 --> 14:24.392
It's all kept.

14:24.412 --> 14:30.400
So it's a real source of research in a very specific way.

14:30.440 --> 14:36.167
We have all these little dedications you will never get in a normal library.

14:36.232 --> 14:41.618
from the parties and the mass organizations of the Communist Party and so on.

14:41.638 --> 14:43.039
Which is very important.

14:43.239 --> 14:50.387
As a scholarly institution, I think you very sagaciously have decided we will collect the language.

14:51.528 --> 14:54.050
And therefore, you don't make any political considerations.

14:54.591 --> 14:56.973
And therefore, this is a wonderful scope.

14:57.014 --> 14:59.196
You are quite sure that you will find it.

14:59.776 --> 15:01.498
And it's on the database.

15:01.518 --> 15:04.281
And you know, if it is German language, you will find it here.

15:04.700 --> 15:09.788
And the other thing is you have no competition to the state libraries.

15:10.068 --> 15:11.571
It's really fit in.

15:12.312 --> 15:26.254
So that together with the state libraries, we have a clear position to serve those who want to have the whole scope arranged.

15:26.274 --> 15:28.497
They can use the state library and us.

15:28.679 --> 15:35.028
And if they only want to work in a German language, they can just keep the rings here.

15:35.048 --> 15:38.953
And as for foreign literature, there are disciplines.

15:39.273 --> 15:42.518
There's a network with the university libraries too.

15:42.538 --> 15:50.709
For example, medicine is collected worldwide in Colonia, technique in Hannover, history in Munich.

15:50.729 --> 15:55.455
So you will get each book, but it's a decentralized system.

15:55.495 --> 15:56.897
You don't get it.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.214
French books and English books here.

16:00.135 --> 16:03.401
So it is just a network.

16:04.603 --> 16:11.915
Like elephants, not a dinosaur.

16:12.496 --> 16:15.120
How many volumes do you have here?

16:15.220 --> 16:15.922
Seven million.

16:16.543 --> 16:20.109
Describe the nature again of the books, the seven million books here.

16:20.489 --> 16:22.733
These are all 20th century books.

16:22.763 --> 16:25.126
Roughly, yes.

16:25.266 --> 16:26.627
Only after 1945.

16:26.988 --> 16:28.109
1945.

16:28.129 --> 16:29.390
1945.

16:29.450 --> 16:37.319
So in Leipzig they have another nine millions because they started earlier.

16:37.339 --> 16:42.584
And for German books there is a publication because the publishers give two copies.

16:42.985 --> 16:46.408
One copy in Leipzig, one copy in Leipzig.

16:46.488 --> 16:48.130
Well, it is process just once.

16:48.346 --> 16:52.571
so that there's no additional effort for the two copies.

16:52.591 --> 16:53.532
So it's one database for everybody?

16:53.552 --> 16:53.712
Yeah.

16:54.013 --> 17:05.947
It's one database and it's processed once so that the second copy is processed so that you can bring it to the stack at once.

17:06.728 --> 17:17.241
And if the book is published in Western part, normally it's just here, and if it's published in Berlin or in the Eastern part, they do it at live scene and put it together in the same moment.

17:17.261 --> 17:18.302
In one database.

17:18.535 --> 17:36.645
So what do you have to do in Leipzig, when you go to Leipzig?

17:36.811 --> 17:46.724
So I have it arranged in such a way that I say, let's go for three days or four weeks.

17:46.804 --> 17:52.913
So it depends on the situation, if there's something important to decide.

17:53.694 --> 17:57.279
And this week, I will go for three days.

17:57.819 --> 18:01.264
And next week, I have to be in Frankfurt World's book fair.

18:02.005 --> 18:04.268
I'm not going to stay for the book fair.

18:04.468 --> 18:05.029
No?

18:05.633 --> 18:11.762
I was hoping to, but I'm going up to Sweden and to Amsterdam.

18:11.922 --> 18:13.144
I can come back next year.

18:13.164 --> 18:15.968
This is more important, actually.

18:16.569 --> 18:19.393
This concept was developed as a national policy?

18:20.053 --> 18:21.135
Yes.

18:21.275 --> 18:24.820
What was the problem that was faced?

18:24.860 --> 18:29.267
Was this just something that was understood, that you were going to keep everything in its original form?

18:29.287 --> 18:33.092
I mean, you could very easily have decided it would be a lot easier to...

18:33.376 --> 18:35.579
to try and put things into digital form.

18:36.040 --> 18:36.962
A lot of people might.

18:37.763 --> 18:43.492
Yeah, but this is a national policy which we trust, we believe in the book.

18:43.712 --> 18:53.628
So we say we want to keep it in a way that the original form is really at the library.

18:54.169 --> 19:00.058
But we are the only institution, I have to say, which is really federal government.

19:00.511 --> 19:06.677
All the others belong still to the lenders, for the lenders have the responsibility for culture in Germany.

19:07.758 --> 19:10.081
I'm sorry, explain that to you.

19:10.101 --> 19:14.886
The Deutsche Weltkrieg belongs to the federal government.

19:14.906 --> 19:22.714
But the state library in Bavaria or the state library in Wirtland, they belong to Bavaria or they belong to Wirtlandberg.

19:24.656 --> 19:29.961
This is a different financing situation, a different authority.

19:31.426 --> 19:59.442
It's very, very interesting that I didn't realize that this comes as a... We have not the power to force any library to buy our services, but to do it, so we are trying to sell central services to avoid that each book is catalogued 20 or 50 times in Germany, so it is only catalogued once, and then we sell it,

19:59.658 --> 20:03.805
We have bibliography, records and other libraries.

20:04.326 --> 20:14.123
But we are forced to look to our clients what we really want.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.970
So we can't say you are obliged to do it.

20:18.355 --> 20:24.362
But they do it, and so there's nearly no library now, which is cataloging the input itself.

20:24.542 --> 20:29.648
They try to get as far as possible the records of the German ones and the English ones.

20:30.169 --> 20:31.751
It's similar to the OCRC.

20:31.911 --> 20:35.615
We are a big service center.

20:35.715 --> 20:38.138
Oh, so really?

20:38.258 --> 20:39.880
Who comes here to read?

20:39.900 --> 20:41.582
What kind of people come here?

20:41.602 --> 20:46.388
60% are university people, students, and professors.

20:46.807 --> 21:10.536
and 40% are companies, banks, lawyers, teachers, this is the relation of users.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.092
You're in my office?

21:12.112 --> 21:12.674
Oh, excellent.

21:12.694 --> 21:14.157
So we go on.

21:14.498 --> 21:18.989
If you agree, I would... Excellent.

21:19.009 --> 21:20.191
We will see you tomorrow.

21:20.252 --> 21:23.118
And you took the train up too, by the way?

21:23.259 --> 21:23.499
Yes.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.602
It's wonderful.

21:24.622 --> 21:25.624
It's very comfortable.

21:26.206 --> 21:28.692
And it's all from the central station down here, right?

21:28.712 --> 21:28.812
Yes.

21:29.129 --> 21:35.938
And I think you'll also be interested in the building itself.

21:36.639 --> 21:40.043
It's a very wonderful little camera here.

21:40.063 --> 21:41.485
We are here since May.

21:41.946 --> 21:45.210
The Chancellor opened the building in May 1997.

21:45.270 --> 21:49.996
And he gave a wonderful speech.

21:50.456 --> 21:55.603
He is a friend of the book, and so it was quite easy to ask him to open.

21:55.703 --> 21:58.006
It's important to have the political support.

21:58.046 --> 21:58.647
That's right.

21:59.251 --> 22:03.977
I mean, there was actually a proposal in Washington that they was defeated, thank goodness.

22:03.997 --> 22:09.564
It wasn't even considered, but that you charge people to use the Library of Congress.

22:09.604 --> 22:10.365
Can you imagine that?

22:10.885 --> 22:13.709
This didn't go anywhere.

22:14.109 --> 22:16.152
One quick question on deaccession.

22:16.993 --> 22:19.175
What's your policy on deaccessioning books?

22:20.777 --> 22:25.343
Deaccessioning, getting rid of books, removing books from your...

22:25.778 --> 22:26.720
From your inventory?

22:27.101 --> 22:29.105
See, this word... Outcutting?

22:29.166 --> 22:29.587
Yes.

22:30.108 --> 22:33.435
There is no de-acceptioning of books.

22:33.455 --> 22:36.542
See, that's an issue in the United States and elsewhere.

22:36.963 --> 22:41.132
No books are ever... Everything forever.

22:42.355 --> 22:43.618
Everything forever.

22:44.341 --> 22:45.462
Can I say that?

22:51.210 --> 22:51.771
You can.

22:51.831 --> 22:52.812
This is a memory.

22:53.032 --> 22:58.319
This is the only systematic memory people have.

22:58.619 --> 23:04.587
So we believe in this, what is it, citation, our motto.

23:05.408 --> 23:06.169
That's excellent.

23:06.189 --> 23:07.331
You have work to do.

23:07.551 --> 23:08.993
Okay.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.635
Thank you, and we will see us tomorrow morning.

23:10.655 --> 23:12.357
Good, and I'll be in touch.

23:13.265 --> 23:31.385
Library of Commons, Cooper from the British Library, and Mr. Lewis, Maurice Lyon, Christoph from Luxembourg, Reis, Willemsen from Denmark, Juchas Ungari, Karthaschow from USNR.

23:31.585 --> 23:43.238
And so each of them had some ideas, but I must confess, the only which is missing, and the second part is on Deutsche Bibliothek.

23:43.555 --> 23:44.877
The head of our divisions.

23:45.157 --> 23:45.978
Is that here?

23:45.998 --> 23:46.940
Ah, here in English.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.320
Oh, here, yes.

23:47.601 --> 23:55.071
So, the head of computer division and the head of... So, the first part is abroad.

23:55.812 --> 23:56.072
I see.

23:56.232 --> 23:58.756
And the second part is... And everything is in English.

23:58.836 --> 23:59.477
Oh, it's in English.

23:59.837 --> 24:01.479
So, where can I get this?

24:02.361 --> 24:06.206
It is obviously published by the German Publishers Union.

24:06.226 --> 24:06.747
Okay.

24:06.767 --> 24:07.688
The famous publisher.

24:07.728 --> 24:09.010
Can I buy it here while I'm here?

24:09.550 --> 24:10.712
Do you think?

24:10.732 --> 24:12.955
Yes, you could buy it, but it's heavy.

24:13.188 --> 24:15.911
Perhaps it is easier to buy it in.

24:15.931 --> 24:19.135
I will just Xerox you on the title page.

24:19.195 --> 24:22.659
But you see, it was published in 1988.

24:23.220 --> 24:26.444
Of course, now we have ten years after.

24:26.484 --> 24:36.816
And in this year, when it was published, of course, Mr. Retsch from TBR was asked, and nobody in this year, 1988,

24:37.049 --> 24:41.395
thought that there would be a... I have to get this book.

24:41.556 --> 24:48.446
There would be a crash of Ude Sussar, Katoschoff, the great Agnes of the Yule, Paul.

24:48.786 --> 24:54.955
And so, ten years after, even internet was, in these days, was not so strong.

24:55.336 --> 24:59.262
So, you see, even within ten years... Amazing.

25:00.824 --> 25:06.853
Even when Peter Lehmann becomes the new director here in 88,

25:07.238 --> 25:11.404
In the same year, he drew for speech.

25:11.464 --> 25:15.691
He didn't mention that he would take Leipzig.

25:15.711 --> 25:19.697
And so, you see, it was a hundred stories.

25:19.857 --> 25:24.884
And maybe I will have it, because I know you have interest in this story.

25:24.904 --> 25:26.587
This is precisely what I'm writing.

25:26.727 --> 25:29.091
And I have some updates.

25:29.111 --> 25:36.081
And maybe in 20 years, if you will read your book, which was published next year, you will see.

25:36.635 --> 25:37.436
Surprising.

25:37.676 --> 25:42.160
But I don't make predictions.

25:42.180 --> 25:44.463
I try to report what other people say.

25:44.703 --> 25:52.250
I was just the editor of this book.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.311
You were the editor.

25:53.391 --> 25:55.113
I was the editor, yeah.

25:55.133 --> 25:56.815
Well, tell me about this now.

25:57.035 --> 26:01.259
The editor gentleman is retiring.

26:01.279 --> 26:04.262
You have to give a gift to him.

26:04.580 --> 26:10.367
So I asked his colleagues, please do the job, and I collect them.

26:10.387 --> 26:21.139
The only one who is missing, you will see, is a French, because the director general of the French library in this day sent me.

26:21.159 --> 26:25.323
If I would tell you the truth, they would hire me at once.

26:25.343 --> 26:29.428
And because I don't wish to lie, so I don't write anything.

26:29.448 --> 26:31.110
He sent everything.

26:31.377 --> 26:34.006
And he was hired afterwards.

26:34.026 --> 26:40.088
Did he have any ideas?

26:40.220 --> 26:45.307
He wished to put a small article on a French library in the 15th century.

26:45.548 --> 26:50.955
And he said, sorry, I can't take this.

26:51.076 --> 26:55.202
The title is National Libraries in the year 2000.

26:55.242 --> 26:55.662
Yes.

26:55.682 --> 27:00.029
And it was published in 88.

27:00.089 --> 27:03.293
So in 88, 2000 was fine.

27:03.313 --> 27:03.814
Now it is.

27:03.794 --> 27:04.315
Hello.

27:04.935 --> 27:08.280
What was your position then?

27:08.600 --> 27:10.703
In these days, my position was the same as now.

27:11.144 --> 27:16.491
I'm here as a deputy since 1972.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.133
So 27 years.

27:18.153 --> 27:19.695
27 years.

27:20.416 --> 27:21.657
A quarter of a century.

27:21.777 --> 27:22.859
A quarter of a century.

27:22.939 --> 27:31.030
I started here as a young man in 66, and six years after I became a deputy, so I was rather young.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.733
And so...

27:34.034 --> 27:41.284
I studied history, medieval history, and this was medieval manuscripts.

27:41.304 --> 27:51.559
And poor Kurt Novak, the only library in total Germany, there is no manuscript at all, and this Hagen-Grant is on here.

27:51.579 --> 27:52.880
Oh, that's wonderful.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.142
Wonderful, yeah.

27:54.162 --> 27:58.308
So you're trained as a historian, not a librarian.

27:58.368 --> 28:00.731
Yeah, so in Germany... But not a librarian.

28:00.751 --> 28:03.315
In Germany, education is if you wish to get

28:03.785 --> 28:11.896
in a library at a top position, head of division or more, you have to study at university.

28:13.198 --> 28:32.323
And whether you study law or history or medicine, anyhow you must have a degree at the university and then you were trained for two years in the library and then you are a librarian for the top positions.

28:32.337 --> 28:46.917
In this library we have 330 staff, 330, only 30, just 10%, are academic librarians, like me.

28:46.937 --> 28:56.890
And then there is a huge mass of librarians, catalogers, and judges.

28:56.910 --> 29:02.057
They have no university degree, they were trained within the library for three years,

29:02.746 --> 29:09.057
And the last level is secretaries and such things.

29:09.879 --> 29:11.101
So we have three levels.

29:11.922 --> 29:13.625
Like in India, the castes.

29:14.667 --> 29:18.654
Lowest level is secretary, typist, hand-touchings.

29:18.674 --> 29:27.370
Then these are the librarians, which are non-academic librarians, which are trained three years in the library.

29:27.518 --> 29:42.395
The majority are working in the cataloging division and then you have the academic library and there are only 10% academic librarians.

29:43.837 --> 29:51.265
Mr. Lehmann studied physics and I studied humanities so it is perhaps not bad to have both in the library.

29:51.515 --> 30:18.332
The majority of our academic libraries are in the subject heading division because you need, of course, for each discipline you need one expert and so we have quite a lot of academic librarians, more than half of them are in the subject heading division and the rest are heads of divisions.

30:18.818 --> 30:19.779
the mass of slaves.

30:21.321 --> 30:28.468
Now when you edited this book, and when it was published ten years, nine years ago... I edited two books.

30:28.848 --> 30:30.510
This was the second one.

30:30.530 --> 30:35.095
The first one was on our new library.

30:36.076 --> 30:48.268
So when we made the competition, there were 150 different architects in the competition to document which ideas it did.

30:48.552 --> 30:50.815
Can I tell you what this book is?

30:50.875 --> 30:54.299
The title is The New... D-I-E.

30:55.260 --> 31:05.191
If you agree, I will hear of this title.

31:05.271 --> 31:09.276
Thank you.

31:09.616 --> 31:13.541
Thank you.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.403
Okay.

31:15.805 --> 31:40.463
Would you like to say, I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that

31:41.607 --> 32:09.555
So you said you did the two books, the other one, but my question was going to be, so this study that you did, the National Library in the year 2000, do you think that it was prophetic or do you think it was wrong?

32:10.025 --> 32:15.092
Some of them were very clear and not wrong.

32:15.112 --> 32:22.503
Some of them, like the DDR, because the world is no longer a DDR, it was wrong.

32:23.684 --> 32:33.518
Some of them, or perhaps even the majority, so that the book will keep its important rule

32:33.852 --> 32:50.390
But nevertheless, in addition, some electronic publications and so forth, the library should pay attention to see that 90% or more are still books and printed materials, dead three editions.

32:52.172 --> 33:03.825
There is a small new group of CD-ROMs and tapes

33:04.075 --> 33:26.739
and internet publications, and that a library which wishes not to become a museum should pay attention to get some contact in this field too, otherwise there's a certain danger that the library will become like a good old Bible, everybody loves it, nobody reads it, and therefore you should have both.

33:28.220 --> 33:31.804
We have the opinion, and the majority of the authors too,

33:32.105 --> 33:37.392
that the book will keep is important, because it is rather cheap, nevertheless.

33:37.412 --> 33:40.716
Electricity, you don't have electricity in each country.

33:41.156 --> 33:45.261
Even our computer system, this very morning, is broken down, total blackout.

33:46.463 --> 33:50.488
If you have a book, you could hack and read.

33:50.968 --> 33:58.618
And therefore, I think we should see that for special purposes,

33:59.273 --> 34:08.385
If you wish to have a research in a bibliography, it is rather easy to have a research in an online system.

34:08.625 --> 34:09.526
You get more.

34:10.568 --> 34:20.160
But if you wish to read a novel or anything else, I personally prefer to read the novel in a printed version and not on the screen.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.803
And so I think you need both.

34:23.144 --> 34:26.388
I don't know of anybody who's ever read a whole book on a computer.

34:26.408 --> 34:28.791
Like you have a plane and a car.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.129
You need both.

34:30.670 --> 34:36.538
You can't say, because we have planes, everybody will use a plane, nobody will use a car or a bicycle.

34:36.558 --> 34:38.260
I think you need both.

34:38.540 --> 34:41.745
Our philosophy is, why not both?

34:42.025 --> 34:44.468
Not either-or, but et-et.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.615
Thank you, thank you, yes.

34:50.455 --> 34:53.518
Now, I would contact this publisher directly?

34:53.578 --> 35:01.927
Yes, you may either contact the publisher directly or go to your bookseller in your Chicago or Massachusetts, please order it.

35:02.247 --> 35:05.651
It's one of the famous ones, and there's no problem.

35:05.671 --> 35:06.692
And it's still in print?

35:06.712 --> 35:08.654
It is still in print, it's still in print.

35:08.674 --> 35:09.174
Good.

35:09.194 --> 35:12.818
If you should get any trouble, please contact me.

35:12.938 --> 35:15.461
I need it!

35:15.481 --> 35:17.543
It's very important because

35:18.333 --> 35:24.702
I'm very interested not only in how things are coming, but how people think they're coming.

35:24.922 --> 35:26.624
What people are predicting.

35:27.265 --> 35:35.877
Of course, some of those authors are still acting, some are retired within the last 10 years.

35:36.077 --> 35:37.239
That's fine.

35:37.259 --> 35:39.422
But they represent contemporary thought.

35:39.442 --> 35:41.285
Yes, you're right.

35:41.705 --> 35:44.509
It's what the thinking is at a certain time.

35:45.113 --> 35:48.336
So are you surprised by things, how things are turning out yourself?

35:48.876 --> 35:49.697
Does it surprise you?

35:50.177 --> 36:10.455
Klaus Lehmann mentioned that we were founded twice by the publisher, 1912 in Leipzig and 1946 in Frankfurt.

36:10.475 --> 36:15.019
So both times the publisher were our fathers and therefore

36:15.235 --> 36:44.635
our governing board is not the Chancellor Kohl or Minister of Internal Affairs it is a governing board with 12 seats and the majority sorry with 11 and the majority there are 5 publishers and only 4 from the ministers so the publishers have the majority in the governing board and those publishers they say we tried

36:45.037 --> 36:46.939
to keep the public alive.

36:47.460 --> 36:48.301
To keep it alive?

36:48.861 --> 36:50.323
The Deutsche will take it alive.

36:51.044 --> 36:57.911
The money, we get the money from the government here up to one o'clock.

36:58.331 --> 37:08.362
And you will be in my office up to eleven o'clock and then you will have Mr. Stephan and the guided tour to see something of this library.

37:08.382 --> 37:12.667
Of course, in one half a day you can't get everything.

37:12.707 --> 37:13.508
It's impossible.

37:13.808 --> 37:20.878
I remember when I was the first time in the States in 72, we had six weeks.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.284
I kept each day in one library.

37:26.285 --> 37:34.716
Nevertheless, of course, you got a good impression, but at the end of the story, you had some additional questions, and then you have to contact the team.

37:34.817 --> 37:38.762
But obviously, I'm really here to get a sense of your philosophy.

37:38.802 --> 37:40.304
Yes, yes, yes.

37:40.484 --> 37:43.208
And so the last thing in our philosophy is...

37:43.458 --> 37:48.445
As for books and for modern material, we say, we will have both.

37:48.685 --> 37:49.786
We have books.

37:50.227 --> 37:59.519
The majority, more than 90%, and maybe 10% important ones are electronic publications, and we should care if possible.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.945
And of course, now we collect CD-ROMs, the publishers.

38:04.005 --> 38:05.187
Give it to us, no problem.

38:05.707 --> 38:08.571
But as for the internet publications,

38:08.821 --> 38:25.705
We have not yet started, it's just planning and the publishers agreed if they would offer internet, they will give up those things and we are free to use them within the reading room, but we are not free to give them outside without charge.

38:25.885 --> 38:30.812
So if we give them outside, the publishers

38:31.282 --> 38:32.603
I will ask for license.

38:33.965 --> 38:35.366
As for the .

38:35.606 --> 38:38.609
There's printed books, there is no problem.

38:38.809 --> 38:39.950
We get two copies.

38:40.070 --> 38:41.612
One copy is going to Leipzig.

38:41.712 --> 38:43.273
One copy is going to Frankfurt.

38:43.714 --> 38:48.618
And the third copy, each publisher is obliged in Germany to give three copies.

38:49.099 --> 38:54.103
One to its region, so a Bavarian publisher, send one copy to Munich.

38:54.824 --> 38:59.128
And this copy, which is going to Munich, is used for interlending purposes.

38:59.615 --> 39:07.162
whereas the Frankfurt and the Leipzig copy are still as last resource only to be used in the reading rooms.

39:07.462 --> 39:18.872
So if anything should happen to this Bavarian copy, you still have two copies, one in Frankfurt, one in... And if the crash would play in here, you have another one in Leipzig.

39:19.352 --> 39:21.054
And so... So you have duplication.

39:21.074 --> 39:22.335
Oh, you have duplication.

39:22.635 --> 39:27.900
But the duplication is only for the books which are published in Germany.

39:28.218 --> 39:36.433
If a German book is published in, say, the United Kingdom of France, we just buy one copy.

39:37.234 --> 39:39.659
We don't get it free, and we buy only one.

39:39.699 --> 39:40.781
And this is Leipzig.

39:40.801 --> 39:42.965
So Leipzig has an additional charge.

39:43.245 --> 39:44.047
There are two charges.

39:44.067 --> 39:48.775
One is preservation and conservation, and one is to get foreign copies.

39:49.025 --> 39:53.332
which are printed in German language about Germany.

39:53.812 --> 39:57.818
So this you will find if you are interested in Leipzig.

39:58.379 --> 40:08.815
So you see, we tried to have a, like in a good, if you are married, you should not have the behavior like twins to do everything twice.

40:09.396 --> 40:17.108
For 40 years, I say it correctly, we had the behavior like twins because the Communist Party

40:17.341 --> 40:19.024
They collect everything.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.986
They made the National Bibliography.

40:21.067 --> 40:23.090
We collect everything and made the National Bibliography.

40:23.350 --> 40:25.654
And it was nearly a total duplication.

40:26.455 --> 40:27.576
A duplication?

40:27.596 --> 40:28.177
Duplication.

40:28.197 --> 40:28.458
Was it?

40:28.898 --> 40:29.179
Was it.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.901
But was it or was it not?

40:31.002 --> 40:32.043
It was.

40:32.504 --> 40:34.747
Up to the reunion for political reasons.

40:35.148 --> 40:38.132
Leipzig said, we are the old National Library.

40:38.393 --> 40:40.656
And we said, we are the only free National Library.

40:40.957 --> 40:43.280
And so we had two National Bibliographies.

40:44.021 --> 40:46.605
Our was called Deutsche Bibliography.

40:47.092 --> 40:55.487
Leipzig was called deutsche national bibliography, but as for the content, and even for the Catholic rules, they were nearly the same.

40:55.828 --> 41:10.855
And therefore it was rather not too difficult to bring those two libraries together, because they were not like enemies, but we tried, if a German publisher and Western, please send an additional copy to Leipzig,

41:11.813 --> 41:15.637
This is in the years before it?

41:15.657 --> 41:20.761
It is, in the Cold War there was a good relationship.

41:20.841 --> 41:22.483
So there was a scholarly understanding?

41:22.503 --> 41:25.185
Yes, there was a scholarly professional understanding.

41:25.205 --> 41:33.113
Even in the Cold War this tie was still existing, perhaps one of the last ties.

41:34.434 --> 41:38.918
So if we wish to change cataloging rules according to the international rules,

41:39.303 --> 41:51.918
We were hanging together with Leipzig in Austria and so we tried within the German speaking countries to get the same rules and so on.

41:51.979 --> 42:03.032
Quite a lot of our staff here were trained in Leipzig and escaped during the Cold War and we hired them.

42:04.109 --> 42:06.152
Not bad.

42:06.172 --> 42:12.562
So there isn't much resistance in Leipzig that there is control from here.

42:12.622 --> 42:13.103
No.

42:13.283 --> 42:17.129
I think Klaus Dieter Lehmann is very clever.

42:17.549 --> 42:21.475
Not to say, I'm the boss.

42:21.976 --> 42:24.179
So he really tried to listen to them.

42:24.339 --> 42:26.763
Of course, they have some problems.

42:27.244 --> 42:28.165
They expect it.

42:29.046 --> 42:32.091
After the reunion, oh, now we'll get lots of money.

42:32.290 --> 42:34.233
because they're rich.

42:34.313 --> 42:41.382
And now, if Klaus-Dieter Lehmann sagt, sorry, we don't hire additional staff, they're a little disappointed.

42:43.184 --> 42:51.916
Thank you.

42:52.156 --> 43:00.948
I have, for you, sorry, just three things.

43:01.408 --> 43:01.909
One is,

43:02.311 --> 43:04.074
The last annual report.

43:04.334 --> 43:08.941
In this annual report, you get all figures on Deutsche Boutique and so on.

43:08.961 --> 43:23.043
If you like it, and you see how many readers in the book, how many students it is, and then some additional addresses and so on.

43:23.063 --> 43:24.605
So it is last annual report.

43:24.705 --> 43:25.006
Excellent.

43:25.226 --> 43:25.767
I can have this?

43:25.927 --> 43:26.888
You can have it, yes.

43:28.030 --> 43:31.255
The second one is quite new.

43:31.876 --> 43:58.221
Just a fortnight ago, this is published quarterly, you see Mr. Lehmann and the Chancellor Kohl on our exhibition, and here there are some additional articles on the Deutsche Boutique, what we are doing in the computer division and in the other divisions.

43:58.336 --> 43:59.057
If you like it.

43:59.077 --> 43:59.598
Yes, yes.

44:00.018 --> 44:00.900
Anything, everything.

44:00.920 --> 44:08.050
And the last thing when you are free, this is the official documentation of our .

44:09.392 --> 44:13.718
Here we have the information speech from Mr. Lehmann, the official speech.

44:14.820 --> 44:19.026
View to the future, some things which you talked about this morning, you will find here again.

44:19.787 --> 44:23.973
And some pictures on the Deutsche Bibliothek.

44:23.993 --> 44:27.077
So you see, I have some impression of the building.

44:27.310 --> 44:43.011
and some figures on the building, how large it is, and so on, may be that you are not obliged to... At some point when my new book is being published, will I be able to get photographs?

44:43.031 --> 44:43.732
Yes.

44:44.413 --> 44:47.818
I brought a camera, but I think you have to get the official one.

44:48.098 --> 44:52.344
You are free to put back here as far as you wish.

44:53.045 --> 44:54.367
No problems at all.

44:54.387 --> 44:55.208
No secrets.

44:55.424 --> 45:01.190
And here are some additional questions which are clear.

45:02.471 --> 45:06.175
This is in German and English.

45:06.635 --> 45:10.660
One part is Frankfurt.

45:11.160 --> 45:14.263
This is Leipzig, just a folder.

45:15.404 --> 45:16.425
And one on Berlin.

45:17.046 --> 45:20.530
And this is together things which belong to everything.

45:22.131 --> 45:24.874
This is excellent.

45:25.192 --> 45:35.406
So, you see, the old part was, this was Leipzig, and this is still Leipzig.

45:35.426 --> 45:36.508
That's where I'm going tomorrow?

45:36.528 --> 45:37.589
Yeah, we're going tomorrow.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.191
And that's what it looks like today.

45:39.211 --> 45:42.876
It is an art deco style, 1913.

45:42.936 --> 45:44.839
It is marvelous.

45:44.859 --> 45:46.621
This is Berlin.

45:46.822 --> 45:51.368
In Berlin, they just collect Coscores and music records.

45:51.803 --> 45:56.790
So Frankfurt is just collecting printed material, but not music.

45:57.370 --> 45:58.832
Music, and what else did you say?

45:58.852 --> 46:00.154
Just music.

46:00.615 --> 46:01.656
Music records.

46:01.676 --> 46:02.097
Oh, recordings.

46:02.197 --> 46:03.739
And recordings.

46:03.759 --> 46:03.959
Tapes.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.185
And tapes, and music cassettes, and scores.

46:08.606 --> 46:09.287
I see.

46:09.347 --> 46:09.547
Audio.

46:09.567 --> 46:17.137
So everything which is referring to music is done in Berlin, and printed material is done here.

46:17.157 --> 46:19.981
And Leipzig is like a twin sister.

46:20.462 --> 46:21.523
Oh, we want one.

46:21.706 --> 46:23.928
Here you will be tomorrow.

46:24.589 --> 46:28.072
Berlin, I think you have, it is just a small division.

46:28.172 --> 46:29.794
Maybe you can get it.

46:29.814 --> 46:31.656
How does this word translate?

46:31.676 --> 46:35.900
It is German or a word bibliothèque.

46:36.301 --> 46:37.762
Bibliothèque is called .

46:37.902 --> 46:39.384
I'm not going to build it that way.

46:39.404 --> 46:40.224
How does that translate?

46:40.264 --> 46:41.005
What does that mean?

46:41.025 --> 46:43.568
It is translate our bibliothèque.

46:43.588 --> 46:45.910
Oh, it's the same word.

46:45.930 --> 46:49.414
It is the same word, but it was founded in 1913.

46:50.014 --> 46:50.835
Okay.

46:51.524 --> 46:54.487
They say, why do we need foreign words?

46:54.727 --> 46:56.870
There are so much nice words, German.

46:57.050 --> 47:00.674
So, in fact, it is a same word.

47:00.694 --> 47:03.477
But this is an international word, and this is an old-fashioned German.

47:03.837 --> 47:10.504
Normally, now the bucherei is just used for very small local libraries.

47:10.804 --> 47:14.368
Sometimes they call it bucherei, but even they prefer the international word.

47:14.388 --> 47:16.691
This is a very old-fashioned word.

47:16.711 --> 47:20.755
But when they started with this word, and now...

47:22.372 --> 47:25.258
Yes.

47:25.739 --> 47:27.241
Yes.

47:27.342 --> 47:43.553
Yes.

47:43.685 --> 47:47.930
there was some concern that we don't need any more symbols.

47:48.150 --> 47:55.659
You will see it in the second book there, you see there are only five architects trying to build symbols.

47:55.679 --> 48:04.630
The rest tries to be small and beautiful and even the city of Frankfurt said you are not allowed

48:04.981 --> 48:07.043
to build a skyscraper.

48:08.565 --> 48:11.248
And therefore... But you have skyscrapers over there.

48:11.268 --> 48:11.909
We have skyscrapers.

48:11.929 --> 48:14.793
It's not like in Washington, where you can't build a skyscraper.

48:14.833 --> 48:15.754
Nothing can be called.

48:15.874 --> 48:16.074
Yeah.

48:16.575 --> 48:18.037
These are all banks.

48:18.057 --> 48:19.739
So bankers get the permission.

48:20.399 --> 48:23.923
But they said, no skyscrapers in this region here.

48:24.825 --> 48:32.794
And therefore, in the competition, it was clearly stated, no skyscrapers, and therefore the

48:33.533 --> 48:46.470
were obliged to bring the mess of books in stacks under the earth, and so you could not have like the Bibliothèque Nationale, four huge towers.

48:46.490 --> 48:49.474
It was strictly forbidden by the city of Africa.

48:49.514 --> 48:56.303
We don't like skyscrapers in this region, we do have enough in this region, and therefore now we change it.

48:56.323 --> 49:00.469
But that was kind of a subtle way of saying also that we really don't want a huge

49:00.550 --> 49:02.693
statement in terms of architecture.

49:02.713 --> 49:04.395
Yes, so it comes together actually.

49:05.076 --> 49:16.352
Now in this year we changed in the city of Frankfurt because you get the European bank, the central bank, and they get the permission to get a new skyscraper.

49:16.412 --> 49:19.977
So in exceptional cases, the analogy is off.
