00:02.714 --> 00:04.356
This book came out in the mid-'90s.

00:04.837 --> 00:06.159
I was the editor.

00:06.519 --> 00:09.123
It blew open the whole question of Heidegger.

00:09.183 --> 00:09.864
Can you spare this?

00:09.964 --> 00:10.185
Yeah.

00:10.725 --> 00:11.847
It's a great book.

00:11.867 --> 00:13.189
It's based on their love letters.

00:13.209 --> 00:15.031
Grab a couple of books from there.

00:15.151 --> 00:16.814
It's based on their love letters.

00:16.834 --> 00:21.100
When this book came out, everyone... Oh, so they were... They were intimate, physically.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.263
Oh, so this wasn't just an intellectual project.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.207
Well, see, everybody thought it was an intellectual project.

00:26.862 --> 00:33.572
Elizabeth Young Bruhl, whose biography of Arendt we had also published, said it was just famous.

00:33.592 --> 00:35.775
Yeah, it's famous.

00:36.396 --> 00:40.501
It was really more of an intellectual companionship and so forth and so on.

00:40.982 --> 00:44.647
And Ruttinger proves that it wasn't.

00:44.667 --> 00:48.012
In fact, Heidegger had seduced Arendt.

00:48.092 --> 00:49.194
She tried to perfume it.

00:49.514 --> 00:53.280
And this has implications for her major book.

00:54.401 --> 00:55.603
I've been interested in it.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.723
And is it really just about what it's conveying?

01:00.743 --> 01:02.025
It's going to be useful, though.

01:02.045 --> 01:03.246
Yeah, yeah.

01:03.346 --> 01:03.586
Excellent.

01:03.666 --> 01:06.869
Yeah, so, I mean, there's some interesting, yeah, good stuff.

01:06.889 --> 01:20.161
And, you know, so the fact that Yale was connected to this, it was connected to Pound, it was connected to ideas in the wide world, you know, it made it possible for us to... That could be a chapter title.

01:20.881 --> 01:24.605
It made it possible for me to imagine, you know, coming up from the basement again.

01:25.926 --> 01:26.046
Right.

01:26.414 --> 01:29.138
Just to give you one last thing.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.341
We published this.

01:32.042 --> 01:32.903
I have a copy.

01:32.963 --> 01:34.204
I have a review copy.

01:34.224 --> 01:34.845
I reviewed it.

01:35.586 --> 01:37.188
But this, you've never seen.

01:37.649 --> 01:40.713
This, it has finally been translated into Russian.

01:40.733 --> 01:45.039
Here, just hold on.

01:45.119 --> 01:53.991
Presented at the Kremlin with Mikhail Gorbachev, the ambassador of Germany, the ambassador of France, and the ambassador of... Just touched.

01:54.697 --> 02:16.587
it's uh and and and now uh i'm i'm trying to raise money for the russian publisher to distribute that to distribute copies of it to all the libraries in russia good all right excellent to be continued um

02:18.220 --> 02:22.526
The Diary of Harnay Tchaikovsky.

02:22.766 --> 02:24.989
C-H-U-K-O-V-S-K-Y.

02:25.009 --> 02:25.610
Right.

02:25.650 --> 02:27.132
C-K-O-R-N-E-I.

02:27.613 --> 02:28.914
And Victor Ehrlich.

02:29.515 --> 02:30.376
C-H.

02:30.577 --> 02:35.383
Edited it, Michael Heim, translated it, and it's the revolution.

02:35.403 --> 02:35.683
Wow.

02:36.384 --> 02:41.171
He becomes a friend of Gorky, a friend of Ahmad, of Bob, of everybody.

02:41.191 --> 02:41.972
He knew everybody.

02:41.992 --> 02:42.613
And who was he?

02:42.653 --> 02:44.295
He was a great writer.

02:44.410 --> 02:46.793
And a children's writer.

02:46.954 --> 02:49.517
He was a children's writer and a good translator.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.441
When is this publishing?

02:52.522 --> 02:53.243
Is this coming out?

02:53.563 --> 02:54.564
It just came out.

02:54.584 --> 02:55.766
It'll be published in the fall.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.029
He was a protector.

02:58.069 --> 03:03.097
His granddaughter showed me when I visited her in Moscow.

03:03.337 --> 03:09.726
She showed me where he hid Gulag Archipelago Solzhenitsyn when the KGB came across for it.

03:10.162 --> 03:13.385
He was the guy who helped.

03:13.445 --> 03:19.611
And so even today, she and Solzhenitsyn are very intimate friends.

03:19.631 --> 03:22.194
So this is how he did it.

03:22.214 --> 03:26.678
He had a children's stage because he loved children's theater and children in general.

03:26.698 --> 03:30.222
And he had a stage slide of his house for children to put on skits.

03:30.242 --> 03:38.650
And when he knew the KGB was coming to search for the palado, he hid the documents under the stage.

03:39.389 --> 03:44.258
made sure that he had children's performances going on all day long.

03:44.278 --> 03:44.599
Wow.

03:44.920 --> 03:52.735
He wrote a book about people who carried his manuscripts in the Soviet Union, but he didn't name some.

03:53.216 --> 03:59.968
He didn't carry the manuscripts over, but he was certainly one of the great protectors.

03:59.989 --> 04:00.790
Yeah, one of the great protectors.

04:01.613 --> 04:02.394
That's fabulous.

04:03.014 --> 04:05.797
It's a wonderful, wonderful, really important book stuff.

04:05.957 --> 04:06.758
And it's one volume?

04:07.559 --> 04:11.443
Well, in the Russian, it was two volumes, each of which was over a thousand pages.

04:11.463 --> 04:13.785
So one of the things... That's a little splash.

04:14.126 --> 04:14.546
I hope so.

04:14.606 --> 04:15.527
I think it will, yeah.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.449
And what category does that fall into?

04:17.669 --> 04:19.571
The various categories you're talking about.

04:19.611 --> 04:20.132
Literature.

04:20.152 --> 04:20.572
Literature.

04:20.652 --> 04:21.853
But when you talk about... Oh, for me?

04:22.114 --> 04:24.416
For the scheme of the press.

04:24.456 --> 04:30.422
This is sort of... I'm hoping that we can sell 2,000 copies of this, maybe 40 months.

04:30.858 --> 04:32.260
all of the major libraries.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.083
Yeah, exactly.

04:34.403 --> 04:36.286
Well, I know it's going to be reviewed.

04:36.306 --> 04:38.208
We already know that it's going to be reviewed.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.972
There's a, he was a tremendous guy.

04:41.913 --> 04:45.679
By the end of his life, his works had been translated into all languages.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.204
In fact, there's a room in the New York, really a great man.

04:49.224 --> 04:50.205
No kidding.

04:50.405 --> 04:54.371
And so he got a doctorate from the university.

04:54.391 --> 04:59.758
My granddaughter shows me all this stuff, his kimono and his samurai sword, doll and things.

04:59.779 --> 05:00.139
It's a great

05:00.558 --> 05:01.619
character.

05:01.639 --> 05:04.543
Anyway, he goes there, and he's surrounded by journalists.

05:05.624 --> 05:10.210
And, of course, you know, he's interviewed.

05:10.270 --> 05:16.357
And the journalist says to him, Professor Tchaikovsky, your words have been translated into all the languages.

05:16.377 --> 05:18.479
Which do you like the most?

05:18.499 --> 05:21.984
And to me, oh, everybody is so happy.

05:22.324 --> 05:25.388
The Japanese is the best.

05:25.528 --> 05:29.012
And Tchaikovsky says, because it's the only

05:31.321 --> 05:33.012
That's great.
