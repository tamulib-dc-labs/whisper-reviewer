00:02.883 --> 00:05.847
Yes, could you tell us a little bit about your background you mentioned?

00:06.168 --> 00:06.929
Yeah, I'm a librarian.

00:07.009 --> 00:15.300
That's why, that's the reason why I'm not, my reaction, I not like computer system people.

00:17.403 --> 00:21.389
I came here from the education ministry.

00:22.150 --> 00:26.296
I was responsible for university libraries.

00:27.558 --> 00:28.519
And...

00:29.579 --> 00:48.304
I was asked to come here because I was an expert in planification, because where I was in the education ministry, we planned for new buildings for the university libraries in France, because we are very late in the university libraries.

00:48.344 --> 00:59.299
We took about 10 or 20 years gap between the university libraries in France and Britain.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.634
also with American libraries.

01:02.654 --> 01:26.012
So we planned, we made a big plan of rebuilding libraries, and when I almost finished that plan, Philippe B. Laval, who is responsible for the general director of this library, asked me to come here to help him to have an overview of the whole planning of the project.

01:26.549 --> 01:37.785
But before I worked in public libraries, university libraries, learning, I was in charge of training librarians.

01:38.706 --> 01:46.978
So... Well, that's very... You see, that's so important that you come from a background of books.

01:47.318 --> 01:47.559
Yes.

01:47.839 --> 01:49.862
And not the modern technology.

01:50.343 --> 01:53.367
So you bring a very profound respect for the book.

01:53.768 --> 01:55.069
for the book as an object.

01:55.089 --> 01:56.331
And for the public also.

01:56.351 --> 01:57.812
And for the public.

01:57.832 --> 02:06.060
And I think this is, you know, because I've seen places in the United States where these people are not librarians at all, but they're computer experts.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.703
Now, you mentioned you taught in library school.

02:09.764 --> 02:23.758
Yes, I study philosophy, and we have a library school in France open to people who have an academic degree.

02:24.835 --> 02:30.382
But here, I have with me a computer expert.

02:30.623 --> 02:31.484
I'm not alone.

02:32.365 --> 02:34.187
Oh, sure.

02:34.207 --> 02:36.170
But they answer to you.

02:36.270 --> 02:41.377
I'm responsible for strategic choices with them and with the general.

02:41.697 --> 02:53.172
It's the idea of to operate the system, to make good choice on a technical viewpoint.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.549
I have computer experts.

02:56.569 --> 03:08.160
But to make strategic choices or to offer strategic choices to the general director or to my colleagues, it's my business.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.381
It's my job.

03:09.401 --> 03:20.012
And just briefly, because I know we have to close to you, Monsieur Lea, in the United States, the teaching of library science is diminishing.

03:20.872 --> 03:22.534
I'm wondering now if they teach

03:23.543 --> 03:29.308
librarianship in France in terms of bibliography, handling books.

03:29.889 --> 03:38.436
Now what they're teaching is more or less communications information, how to handle computers and computer technology.

03:39.317 --> 03:41.919
Do you find a similar kind of attitude here in France?

03:42.459 --> 03:53.449
It's a vast question because training schools never

03:54.323 --> 03:55.084
up to date.

03:55.745 --> 04:12.449
I mean, they are very often in a lot of countries, they are very often a few late in considering the state of the art, the real state of the art.

04:12.489 --> 04:22.603
So it's very strange, but in the library schools, you may observe the late state of the art.

04:23.284 --> 04:24.145
But we

04:24.665 --> 04:38.385
In France, we teach bibliography, bibliographic descriptions, and we try also to introduce new modules on public.

04:39.426 --> 04:46.356
We have a strong interest in public behaviors.

04:47.638 --> 04:54.368
It was very important to sensibilize librarians to

04:55.225 --> 05:12.381
public questions because sometimes the young librarians believe that it's sufficient to buy books and to put them in a very beautiful library and to open the library and always is done.

05:13.202 --> 05:21.570
So now we make efforts to sensibilize them to the idea that it's not sufficient

05:22.057 --> 05:25.641
You may hear what the public wants.

05:25.901 --> 05:30.347
And the way you offer the book is very important.

05:31.768 --> 05:32.529
Something simple.

05:32.649 --> 05:44.083
If you put 1,000, 100,000 books in a big reading room, maybe the public don't enter in the reading room.

05:44.303 --> 05:48.688
Because we learn that the public don't have

05:49.411 --> 05:57.039
don't like to have a huge hill of knowledge.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.661
People are afraid.

05:58.881 --> 05:59.662
They go away.

06:01.464 --> 06:05.509
It's the same with bookshops, as you see.

06:07.931 --> 06:16.701
Most people in France prefer to have small or middle-sized bookshops and to browse.

06:17.727 --> 06:26.658
by themselves, not to have big book supermarkets and to... Well, we're writing about this, too.

06:26.698 --> 06:34.247
This is a great concern in the United States, where the super bookstore is driving all the independents out of business.

06:35.088 --> 06:39.133
And we were just remarking at how wonderful all the bookstores that you have.

06:39.733 --> 06:45.000
They're all different, and they all look like you're owned by individuals and not by enormous chains.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.683
So it's a point we...

06:47.883 --> 06:50.707
We insist on library teaching.

06:51.769 --> 06:59.059
But on technology, we are searching the good way.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.341
It's not evident.

07:01.363 --> 07:07.011
In some years, we teach too much technology.

07:07.371 --> 07:08.613
It was too much for libraries.

07:08.653 --> 07:15.483
They don't need to know very carefully how the machines are running.

07:15.623 --> 07:16.725
It's not their concern.

07:17.684 --> 07:29.135
then they must know something about the main objectives of the software or how the market is moving.

07:30.336 --> 07:37.924
But it's not evident because you have to move teachers.

07:38.004 --> 07:43.429
You have to choose the teachers and to move them sometimes.

07:45.711 --> 07:46.712
It's a very hard business.

07:47.198 --> 07:49.321
I think we can conclude.

07:49.341 --> 07:52.566
We have to get to our next appointment together.

07:52.686 --> 07:56.471
This seems to me that in France, the book remains a precious object.

07:56.532 --> 08:05.184
The book is, in that sense, not just with the attitude that you profess here, but, you know, all over.

08:06.266 --> 08:09.751
In the bookstores, you put up monuments to Moliere.

08:10.592 --> 08:13.777
You named streets after balzai.

08:13.877 --> 08:14.758
The written word

08:15.177 --> 08:19.582
And the vehicle that contains it is a precious thing, it seems to me.

08:19.602 --> 08:20.603
Yes, we believe in that.

08:20.803 --> 08:31.575
And we believe that we need big collections of books and new technology together.

08:32.916 --> 08:38.322
But we cannot replace these collections by new technology.

08:39.944 --> 08:41.646
It's the main idea.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.648
And in the States, it's the same.

08:44.270 --> 08:54.687
Your main remarkable libraries are made of very huge collections, even in big university libraries.

08:55.649 --> 09:00.918
And your university adds some technology to its collections.

09:02.140 --> 09:09.973
It's very rare to meet a library without books and only with technology.

09:10.949 --> 09:12.812
It's happening in a few instances.

09:12.952 --> 09:17.799
Yes, but only in a lot of disciplines.

09:17.819 --> 09:19.982
Very specific, specialized disciplines, yes.

09:21.804 --> 09:26.951
I'm not so sure I like it that way, but that's the end of the story.

09:27.773 --> 09:34.362
So, I will send you the chapter when it's ready, and some articles.

09:34.482 --> 09:35.704
And you said you have some articles.

09:35.724 --> 09:35.944
Yes.
