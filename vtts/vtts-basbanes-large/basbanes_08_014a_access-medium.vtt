00:03.136 --> 00:14.920
How do you like the arc of your career?

00:14.940 --> 00:17.685
I mean, five novels now?

00:18.239 --> 00:24.171
The first time I've seen the previous four novels described as a tetralogy, which is interesting.

00:24.231 --> 00:25.213
Well, that's interesting.

00:25.253 --> 00:29.001
I wouldn't know how to describe them myself, I guess about a year ago.

00:29.021 --> 00:30.604
Did you see that in the LA Times?

00:30.704 --> 00:31.386
No, I didn't.

00:31.426 --> 00:35.995
The tetralogy of novels is not complete, which is striking out for me.

00:36.076 --> 00:38.599
striking out for a new ground.

00:38.740 --> 00:51.236
Well, the funny thing is either each novel is, I've noticed this thing is either Louise Erdrich is off the reservation, Louise Erdrich should go back to the reservation, Louise Erdrich should never have left the reservation.

00:51.337 --> 00:57.905
Each one gets its own little spin, but the fact is they all are related, and I don't think that's going to stop.

00:57.965 --> 01:00.649
I finally figured that I'm working on one long book.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.624
So that's how it's going to be for a while.

01:03.804 --> 01:04.846
I don't know at all.

01:04.866 --> 01:11.255
And you mean that quite... I mean that literally, that each of these is part of a very long book.

01:11.936 --> 01:16.884
And that, for instance, revising and adding two... Just anticipating my questions.

01:16.904 --> 01:18.606
Yeah, Love Medicine was part of that.

01:19.187 --> 01:26.879
I had several chapters that I hadn't had the foresight to put into Love Medicine.

01:27.339 --> 01:29.082
I didn't really write anything new.

01:29.182 --> 01:30.484
I just added what I had.

01:31.088 --> 01:37.053
forgotten and didn't realize belonged in love medicine.

01:37.073 --> 01:39.455
And I'll probably... It was already written.

01:39.575 --> 01:40.836
It was already written, yeah.

01:40.856 --> 01:42.438
Do you mind my exploring that just a bit?

01:42.458 --> 01:43.298
No, a bit.

01:43.318 --> 01:47.822
But why would you have gone back and tinkered with something that's finished work?

01:48.223 --> 01:49.284
Yeah, I didn't revise it.

01:50.605 --> 01:52.666
It wasn't revised, but I added to it.

01:53.247 --> 02:00.353
There was a big distinction in mind here, because when I was working on it, I was just so overwhelmed with

02:01.463 --> 02:07.572
I wrote things by hand and just threw them in a box.

02:07.852 --> 02:10.236
So I had a big box of material.

02:11.117 --> 02:16.605
And I was looking through it one day, and I realized I had chapters I really had not included.

02:17.546 --> 02:30.745
So when Love Medicine came up to be re-licensed, I decided that instead of looking at it as a finished book, or as some sort of sacred thing, I would look at it as a kind of expanding file.

02:31.231 --> 02:34.054
and I would put what I needed to put in there.

02:34.114 --> 02:36.236
I've explored this with other writers.

02:37.457 --> 02:43.122
Tim O'Brien very quietly has tinkered with Cacciato, for instance.

02:43.142 --> 02:43.702
Oh, really?

02:44.223 --> 02:44.563
Yeah.

02:44.623 --> 02:53.491
Tim, you know, doesn't this represent work that you did at a very crucial point in your development in your life, and isn't it time to go on and do something else?

02:53.732 --> 02:59.517
I mean, Bill Kennedy has had an apple opportunity to fool around with the Intrep, which is his least successful novel.

03:00.087 --> 03:01.409
And he said, it's finished work.

03:01.449 --> 03:01.850
I leave it.

03:01.970 --> 03:02.751
He leaves it, yep.

03:03.152 --> 03:05.256
You know, I did that when I was in my 30s.

03:05.536 --> 03:05.676
Right.

03:05.776 --> 03:07.139
I'm someplace else now.

03:07.720 --> 03:16.915
And what you're telling me now is that this is work that was already done, and you were just kind of... Yeah, I'm not tinkering with what's written.

03:16.995 --> 03:18.097
I don't change the words.

03:18.438 --> 03:22.424
You're not even tinkering with, but what you're doing is adding to what was published.

03:22.665 --> 03:23.827
Yes, adding to what was published.

03:23.847 --> 03:24.728
And there is a distinction.

03:25.180 --> 03:28.468
To me, there is a big donation.

03:28.548 --> 03:41.739
As a reader, there is something that I trust that the writer isn't going to go back and grab those words from under me like a rug, if I'm attached to those words.

03:41.759 --> 03:43.543
And who knows what words

03:44.401 --> 03:45.703
get to people in which don't.

03:45.823 --> 03:50.749
I don't, and so I don't go back and change the words or change the... Yes, Henry James did.

03:50.909 --> 03:53.552
Yes, yes, no, people do.

03:53.632 --> 03:54.653
Yes, yes.

03:54.854 --> 04:03.584
Henry James, with the New York edition, he was supposed to bring out the, you know, the preface, you know, I'd go in and rewrite the novel.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.628
Rewrite the novel.

04:07.132 --> 04:09.976
I mean, wasn't that Wordsworth who tinkered until he died?

04:10.277 --> 04:11.358
It made the poems worse.

04:11.578 --> 04:12.480
You can do that, too.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.902
That's what I'm afraid of, too.

04:14.082 --> 04:15.224
Leave it.

04:15.785 --> 04:15.885
Yeah.

04:16.926 --> 04:17.167
Yeah.

04:17.687 --> 04:17.928
Yeah.

04:18.749 --> 04:20.952
If you don't mind my going along on this thing.

04:20.972 --> 04:22.815
Not a bit, because it's interesting to me, too.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.738
Because you say it's one book.

04:24.918 --> 04:25.699
It's one book.

04:25.799 --> 04:35.974
My first question was, you know, I tossed it out, the arc of your career, and the arc of your career apparently is that you started on one book, and you're still writing it.

04:36.241 --> 04:44.369
Well, I'd say it's more like the... I mean, if it has any shape, it's like the Great Plains.

04:44.389 --> 04:46.972
It's just this long, flat road.

04:48.273 --> 04:58.724
I'm on it pretty much for... It's not that I'm going to depart or come back to the novels anymore.

04:58.864 --> 05:02.147
I'm just adding to a long...

05:02.718 --> 05:14.391
But do you see this book as large as it may be, as a book that has a beginning, a middle, and an end in a unit?

05:14.411 --> 05:14.771
Yes.

05:15.072 --> 05:15.973
At some point.

05:15.993 --> 05:16.473
I do.

05:16.613 --> 05:17.594
There will be a corpus.

05:17.975 --> 05:18.535
There will be.

05:18.776 --> 05:24.041
It will be a book that has its beginning, middle, and end, yeah.

05:24.182 --> 05:26.644
And you're still developing, you're still visualizing.

05:26.664 --> 05:29.147
I'm still visualizing, because I have to now go back.

05:29.431 --> 05:33.437
to the years before Trax.

05:34.599 --> 05:43.732
And then I have to go, as I was writing the Bingo Palace, I realized that it has a companion book that goes on from it, as does Trax.

05:44.654 --> 05:57.092
And so the next books are probably going to be, you know, I might do some short stories because I need to at least

05:58.793 --> 06:01.175
sink a few new tap roots.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.358
Have you done stories?

06:04.398 --> 06:05.299
I think that's one thing.

06:05.319 --> 06:11.846
I haven't done any non-related ones, and I wanted to do some that aren't related, just to think about it.

06:11.866 --> 06:13.447
Is it a challenge as a fiction writer, or just a challenge?

06:13.668 --> 06:14.508
Yeah, it's a challenge.

06:15.289 --> 06:15.810
It's a challenge.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.472
But I'm sure they'll end up being related to other people.

06:18.592 --> 06:23.057
I thought this one would not be related until about three quarters through.

06:23.617 --> 06:27.501
And then it turned out to be about the man in love medicine who

06:28.460 --> 06:30.923
let June walk off into the snow.

06:31.423 --> 06:32.785
It's very powerful.

06:32.805 --> 06:33.245
And I remember it.

06:33.265 --> 06:34.267
Oh, thank you.

06:34.287 --> 06:35.728
You did remember when you first?

06:35.748 --> 06:36.129
Yeah, I remember.

06:36.149 --> 06:36.709
It's a very powerful thing.

06:37.070 --> 06:38.291
It's a very powerful image.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.013
It stayed with me.

06:40.193 --> 06:41.635
For a woman.

06:41.655 --> 06:42.616
It screwed the whole way.

06:42.816 --> 06:43.337
Oh, yeah.

06:43.977 --> 06:45.439
No, it's true.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.501
But who was the man, you know?

06:47.662 --> 06:57.032
And then I was writing about this Jack Mauser, and eventually it occurred to me that he had, something had to have happened to

06:57.282 --> 07:04.893
throw him into this search for union, somehow, and what happened.

07:04.913 --> 07:11.904
And finally, I saw him there in that bar and realized that she was his very first wife.

07:12.004 --> 07:13.446
June was his very first wife.

07:13.526 --> 07:17.452
And does this spring from that image, this novel?

07:17.472 --> 07:18.473
The whole novel?

07:18.814 --> 07:18.914
Yeah.

07:18.934 --> 07:19.715
No, no.

07:19.795 --> 07:25.804
That was way in the very last quarter of writing this book.

07:26.290 --> 07:27.552
I wrote the beginning.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.715
Genesis was the middle.

07:29.735 --> 07:31.919
Started in the middle with this idea of these women.

07:34.904 --> 07:38.690
First playing blackjack, I went and played a lot of blackjack just to see.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.132
You went?

07:40.152 --> 07:40.793
Of course not.

07:40.833 --> 07:42.957
No, I lost.

07:42.997 --> 07:45.621
We've got the world's largest tribal.

07:46.262 --> 07:47.764
Sure you do.

07:47.784 --> 07:49.567
That's 45 minutes from where I live.

07:49.587 --> 07:51.130
Thankfully, I've only been twice.

07:51.210 --> 07:52.652
Oh, you've been twice, though.

07:52.801 --> 07:54.943
Oh, I'd probably go more if I had to win.

07:56.926 --> 07:58.968
But I hate to go get money away.

07:59.088 --> 08:00.971
I do too, but... I hate to lose.

08:01.111 --> 08:01.972
I know, I hate to lose.

08:01.992 --> 08:02.713
I hate to lose money.

08:02.913 --> 08:04.535
Yeah, well... That's very hard to make.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.978
Well, see, you're not going to get hooked into this, then.

08:07.398 --> 08:09.280
I'd love to win, though.

08:09.300 --> 08:09.701
Oh.

08:09.721 --> 08:11.022
It's winning.

08:11.042 --> 08:16.549
Winning is... Winning is... It's wonderful, but not losing.

08:16.569 --> 08:17.630
Yeah, losing is bad.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.211
It's bad.

08:18.951 --> 08:19.332
Yeah.

08:19.352 --> 08:20.293
I'm sorry to go off on it.

08:21.016 --> 08:23.981
Not at all, but, you know, it really is... Blackjack.

08:24.262 --> 08:25.223
Blackjack, yes.

08:25.284 --> 08:26.666
I wouldn't play blackjack.

08:27.047 --> 08:37.826
Well, I got more into it because I enjoyed the give and take between the dealer and the players and the relationship.

08:37.846 --> 08:41.953
Yeah, she typically will advise you in not-so-subtle ways.

08:42.293 --> 08:43.596
Mm-hmm.

08:43.616 --> 08:44.357
It's good then, right?

08:45.620 --> 08:47.482
You could really split those two cards.

08:47.502 --> 08:48.183
Oh, I didn't know.

08:48.343 --> 08:49.845
I didn't know.

08:49.865 --> 08:51.287
You could held down.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.529
Yeah, they'll say that.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.452
I did that once.

08:55.472 --> 08:57.394
Well, this doesn't always happen.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.156
Doesn't always work.

08:59.176 --> 09:00.558
I should have told you.

09:00.658 --> 09:01.859
It doesn't always work.

09:01.879 --> 09:02.500
You're taking a risk.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.601
Well, no kidding.

09:03.661 --> 09:04.903
Why are you guys in business?

09:06.505 --> 09:12.392
I have cousins who are in tribal blackjack dealers.

09:12.993 --> 09:13.433
So,

09:13.700 --> 09:20.990
You know, and in, well, throughout the country, you know, these casinos have sprung up.

09:21.010 --> 09:23.993
So, how did we get onto the casinos?

09:24.054 --> 09:25.896
We were talking about the book began in the middle.

09:26.236 --> 09:28.019
Oh, it began in the middle with this blackjack thing.

09:28.259 --> 09:29.541
Yeah, and then I said, do you play?

09:29.561 --> 09:31.323
Yeah, then we were... I shouldn't do that.

09:31.563 --> 09:34.727
Not a bit, but anyway, so... No, I shouldn't, because you were telling me something important.

09:34.748 --> 09:39.674
Yeah, well, anyway, so that's where it started, this idea of these women playing blackjack.

09:40.495 --> 09:42.458
This is from a chiropractor.

09:42.478 --> 09:42.778
It's important.

09:44.378 --> 09:46.382
I can't believe that.

09:46.422 --> 09:48.106
That's hilarious.

09:48.146 --> 09:48.767
That's fine.

09:49.027 --> 09:50.070
That's hilarious.

09:53.737 --> 09:55.861
That's the best.

09:56.122 --> 09:56.463
Go ahead.

09:56.483 --> 09:57.364
I'm sorry.

09:57.445 --> 09:58.467
Oh, I can't.

09:58.627 --> 09:59.128
So, anyway.

09:59.328 --> 10:01.553
Oh, jeez.

10:01.613 --> 10:02.375
I couldn't take that.

10:02.395 --> 10:03.317
That's a classic.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.058
Look at others.

10:04.223 --> 10:05.485
No, you have more than one?

10:05.765 --> 10:06.887
Yeah, I do.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.527
It's really funny.

10:07.848 --> 10:08.509
Are you serious?

10:08.529 --> 10:09.550
You want to give me this pen?

10:09.570 --> 10:11.052
I'll give you a chiropractic pen.

10:11.112 --> 10:11.773
Are you kidding?

10:12.154 --> 10:13.095
I'm going to find something.

10:13.115 --> 10:14.076
We'll have to trade something.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.478
I'll find something from North Dakota.

10:15.558 --> 10:17.300
Oh, I've got a Mason Shoe Dealers pen.

10:18.642 --> 10:20.565
Anyway, let's listen.

10:20.585 --> 10:22.087
Back to the... Thank you.

10:22.227 --> 10:23.028
I can't pour it.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.430
Okay, let's get back to this.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.154
Let's get back to the blackjack game.

10:27.174 --> 10:28.235
I'm in the middle of the novel.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.276
Okay, anyway.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.858
So, yeah, I saw these women.

10:30.879 --> 10:32.020
I just have to take this.

10:32.877 --> 10:37.524
I saw these women trapped together in this car in a blizzard.

10:37.544 --> 10:44.194
There had been a blizzard in, I think, 068 in Fargo, in which people really were trapped in this underpass.

10:44.214 --> 10:49.281
And I remember being, you know, the complete shock of this.

10:49.622 --> 10:52.967
And yet, every year, something like this would happen.

10:55.070 --> 10:57.193
Indeed, people walked off into the snow.

10:57.253 --> 11:02.040
Freezing and melting is really the theme of this book and the theme of

11:02.527 --> 11:04.570
What, melting?

11:04.590 --> 11:05.231
What love.

11:05.391 --> 11:05.952
Well, yeah.

11:06.032 --> 11:09.177
You know, at the end there's a lot of melting and there's a lot of freezing.

11:09.197 --> 11:10.098
There's a lot of snow.

11:10.159 --> 11:11.020
There's a lot of fire.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.044
I mean, the book ends is snow.

11:14.545 --> 11:14.926
Yeah.

11:15.166 --> 11:15.807
You're looking for that.

11:15.887 --> 11:16.408
That's right.

11:16.428 --> 11:17.470
It is framed by snow.

11:17.490 --> 11:18.351
Framed by snow.

11:18.952 --> 11:19.252
Yeah.

11:20.294 --> 11:29.007
And by his... After he, Jack, allows June...

11:29.358 --> 11:38.151
and it's just summer months, to walk out into the snow, and, you know, he never sees her again until she's... She didn't even know his name.

11:38.171 --> 11:39.513
No, she didn't even know his real name.

11:39.773 --> 11:40.054
Yeah.

11:40.955 --> 11:43.439
I mean, he didn't even give her his real name, and he married her.

11:45.261 --> 11:46.864
Legally binding, apparently.

11:46.884 --> 11:47.825
Well, at least to him.

11:48.066 --> 11:48.947
Who knows, really.

11:49.047 --> 11:51.751
But that's a true thing, too.

11:51.811 --> 11:59.162
I had a friend in high school who did get his... He was a matchbook reverend, so, I mean, there's a detail.

12:01.049 --> 12:03.292
true detail anyway.

12:03.312 --> 12:08.640
So, he emotionally freezes.

12:09.381 --> 12:27.107
He's paralyzed emotionally, I think, and throughout the rest of his next 20 years of life, he's haunted, paralyzed, and unable to really form a true, or to

12:29.973 --> 12:32.816
to bear the depth of his own feelings.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.439
You see, and he has to have that basic decency.

12:36.459 --> 12:37.560
He's a jerk.

12:37.580 --> 12:38.320
Yeah, he's a jerk.

12:38.681 --> 12:41.563
Well, how can you... Yeah, he's a jerk with basic decency.

12:41.623 --> 12:45.867
I mean, a total jerk wouldn't even have given a second thought.

12:45.947 --> 12:46.127
No.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.369
A stupid woman died.

12:48.870 --> 12:49.090
Right.

12:49.150 --> 12:50.111
That would be the attitude.

12:50.131 --> 12:50.471
Yeah.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.754
I mean, that would be the attitude of a worthless person.

12:54.135 --> 12:54.355
Exactly.

12:54.375 --> 12:59.119
But this guy felt badly enough that we do have some sense of

13:00.095 --> 13:04.820
He's not a shallow person for all the mistakes he makes.

13:06.262 --> 13:09.685
I think that's... I mean, it's not an anti-Jack novel.

13:09.886 --> 13:11.307
Not a bit, I don't think.

13:12.068 --> 13:12.809
I don't think so.

13:12.829 --> 13:15.592
Oh, good, I don't... You know, four women who loved him, I mean... They loved him.

13:15.732 --> 13:17.434
...for however long or short.

13:17.654 --> 13:21.218
They didn't get by him, too, I think, which I think is important.

13:21.238 --> 13:24.081
They survive him, but they don't start loving him, either.

13:24.101 --> 13:27.545
Yeah, but there was a part of them that loved him, I guess.

13:27.565 --> 13:27.925
Yeah.

13:28.158 --> 13:31.461
But they did kind of outgrow him, too, don't you think?

13:31.481 --> 13:33.082
I think they outgrow him, that's true.

13:33.403 --> 13:44.513
Except for Eleanor, who maybe...she's the most neurotic of any of them, perhaps, even though she doesn't think of herself that way.

13:45.393 --> 13:57.304
But perhaps...they have a very, you know, romantic, long-standing

13:57.807 --> 14:01.571
relationship that survives other marriages somehow.

14:02.952 --> 14:11.700
And, you know, the final explanation is that they're both sort of jerks who are decent at heart somehow.

14:12.701 --> 14:14.603
And they really do love each other.

14:15.003 --> 14:25.333
And there really is no, it's one of those, you know, I know they've got chemicals in the brain to explain romantic love and

14:25.718 --> 14:29.521
everything that goes with it, but I hope to God they never get to the bottom of it.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.023
That's a great line.

14:31.043 --> 14:33.485
I'm always looking for the kicker of my story.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.226
I think they just gave it to me.

14:35.246 --> 14:37.248
The kicker is the last sentence.

14:37.268 --> 14:45.435
When I heard that there was something in chocolate, it was also something they discovered, I thought... Don't let it be.

14:45.455 --> 14:46.977
Don't let it be.

14:48.158 --> 14:50.260
But, at any rate, I don't think.

14:51.761 --> 14:52.662
I hope they don't.

14:52.702 --> 14:55.084
Well, let's circle back to the premise again.

14:55.435 --> 15:00.881
might say it's, you know, only coincidental, but coincidences happen in life.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.423
Yeah, coincidences, too.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.885
And I think you always have to accept it off his premise.

15:05.246 --> 15:08.689
All right, the four women liked him enough to come to the funeral, right?

15:08.870 --> 15:09.811
Right.

15:11.172 --> 15:12.253
And they went off.

15:12.273 --> 15:19.481
Or, you know, maybe the other thing is that, you know, they are all kind of in competition about what to do with his ashes, you know, his remains.

15:20.302 --> 15:22.224
And that sort of rang true to me.

15:22.344 --> 15:24.126
One woman decides, you know,

15:24.460 --> 15:33.528
throws out the candy from his last cheap gesture, which was a big box heart of chocolates, and puts his ashes in it.

15:34.249 --> 15:50.804
And then when she finds that he actually meant to give it to yet another wife, it was a mistake, she opens the ashes up and, of course, they blow on to the women and they can't really eradicate even his supposed remains from their clothing.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.385
He's just with them.

15:53.026 --> 15:54.467
He's just in them somehow.

15:54.869 --> 16:12.067
Do you see the metaphoric possibilities of these things when you're writing, or are they just kind of things that spring from... Sometimes I have to really admit that story springs out of an actual story that happened to a mutual friend of Michael's and mine.

16:13.889 --> 16:21.197
You know, the idea that the dearly beloved's ashes blowing back on you and not being able to get him out of your clothing is just...

16:21.599 --> 16:25.124
You'll never forget the metaphoric possibilities of that.

16:25.144 --> 16:25.925
It's true.

16:26.065 --> 16:27.427
It is.

16:27.467 --> 16:28.569
It's great.

16:29.390 --> 16:33.455
Some of the things come from little incidents.

16:33.555 --> 16:49.497
I don't know whether the man who actually decides to... I don't know if I should cut it...

16:49.983 --> 16:55.331
immolate himself with his wife, where that came from, except that I felt it was necessary.

16:55.391 --> 17:04.285
You know, you're talking about coincidences and kind of playing with that sort of thing, and that was acting out the exact, the burning love.

17:04.305 --> 17:08.631
I mean, there was something that I couldn't resist about it, and through the book.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.133
They don't bother me, by the way.

17:10.434 --> 17:11.876
I don't know why they should bother other people.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.418
Well, see, it's a book.

17:13.438 --> 17:14.540
That's why, it's a book.

17:15.061 --> 17:16.343
Why, why?

17:16.463 --> 17:19.888
We have to accept the author and her, accept the premise.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.945
And let's see how she pulls it off.

17:22.965 --> 17:25.547
That's my job as a reader.

17:25.567 --> 17:26.428
Yeah, that's good.

17:26.448 --> 17:27.209
And do I enjoy it?

17:27.810 --> 17:28.710
Yeah, you know?

17:28.730 --> 17:32.734
I think that's what I, I like the story part of doing this so much.

17:32.835 --> 17:34.416
It's a story about storytelling, too.

17:34.656 --> 17:34.977
It is.

17:35.037 --> 17:35.938
It's about storytelling.

17:35.958 --> 17:40.822
It's almost, I mean, you can resonate with Boccaccio or Chaucer, you know?

17:40.862 --> 17:42.024
That's where it starts.

17:42.084 --> 17:43.605
They're almost pilgrims, aren't they?

17:43.705 --> 17:48.610
They're on their way, not to Canterbury, but someplace else, and they're stuck.

17:49.079 --> 17:49.680
And here we are.

17:49.740 --> 17:50.622
What the hell are we going to do?

17:50.642 --> 17:51.263
We're going to talk.

17:51.283 --> 17:52.225
We're going to tell stories.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.629
What are we going to tell stories about the common thread?

17:54.909 --> 17:55.510
Absolutely.

17:56.252 --> 17:57.033
It's the oldest thing.

17:57.374 --> 17:59.638
And also, Isak Denison did one of these.

17:59.838 --> 18:02.543
It's a stranded traveler's tale, you know, in Deluge at Nordinine.

18:02.863 --> 18:12.741
And, of course, your references were very... I read these as I was working on this because I knew from the beginning it was, of course, something I had to...

18:13.261 --> 18:14.682
Right, yeah.

18:15.243 --> 18:31.660
But I thought it was going to be just that little central, you know, premise and piece that was going to be all, and then the, as you call it, the bookends, the end pieces, grew and grew and grew, which I think was very necessary, because then it became a novel, not just a novel.

18:31.680 --> 18:37.426
Did it also exert pressure in the middle, though, from the polar ends?

18:37.446 --> 18:37.607
No?

18:38.127 --> 18:38.948
It probably did.

18:39.113 --> 18:51.589
I started, this was the first book I wrote after starting to, after 23 years of not even touching the piano, starting to take piano lessons again.

18:51.629 --> 19:03.104
And I had a wonderful teacher who told me, working on the Path of Teak, and she said, start learning the end first.

19:04.086 --> 19:05.968
You don't have to start from the beginning and go to the end.

19:05.988 --> 19:07.450
So I wrote the end for

19:07.970 --> 19:11.594
about a year before I came back to the rest of it.

19:11.634 --> 19:13.816
Yeah, I just had an interview with Otto Bettman.

19:13.836 --> 19:16.398
Do you know who Otto Bettman is from the Bettman Archive?

19:16.539 --> 19:17.580
Of course, yeah.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.261
He's alive and well in Florida.

19:19.482 --> 19:19.982
Really, huh?

19:21.243 --> 19:26.869
I've decided he's the prologue of my next book, and he's also the world authority on Bach.

19:27.770 --> 19:35.458
And I was taking some pictures of him after he was in here, and I said, we just kind of get some pictures of you at your work, and he starts to play this Bach piece.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.960
I take the quarter line, and that's wonderful.

19:38.463 --> 19:39.625
I said, why Bach?

19:39.645 --> 19:44.031
He said, he always returns from the same place he started.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.413
I mean, it's a continuum.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.015
This man is 93 years old.

19:47.035 --> 19:49.759
He's lived every decade of the 21st century.

19:49.779 --> 19:52.203
Oh, what a... And I said, what if I get goosebumps?

19:52.223 --> 19:54.706
And I said, God, there's the profile for the book, you know.

19:54.726 --> 19:55.387
Yeah, that's wonderful.

19:55.447 --> 19:57.490
I think we're using him way back in the back of the book.

19:57.510 --> 19:58.712
Always returns.

19:58.872 --> 20:01.536
But if you think Bach, always does return.

20:01.556 --> 20:02.798
Always returns.

20:02.858 --> 20:04.320
It's like a big jazz musician.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.403
I mean, whatever the new problem is.

20:06.423 --> 20:08.065
Then you have that, your heart just...

20:08.365 --> 20:08.846
Yeah.

20:09.186 --> 20:11.790
Just, it grabs you, doesn't it?

20:11.850 --> 20:12.671
What you just said, absolutely.

20:12.691 --> 20:13.332
Grabs you.

20:13.352 --> 20:16.998
Connecting with me, I love it, the fact that you had that ending.

20:17.018 --> 20:17.679
I love the writers.

20:17.699 --> 20:18.600
The writers amuse me.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.203
You say, I have no idea where it's going.

20:20.223 --> 20:21.284
I grab it and it gets there.

20:21.425 --> 20:22.566
Yeah.

20:22.586 --> 20:23.668
But that didn't happen yet.

20:23.688 --> 20:24.649
You knew where it was going.

20:25.430 --> 20:37.849
Well, I worked on the end, and really because of working in, starting working on music again, and I realized that if you keep going from the beginning,

20:38.487 --> 20:40.450
and working all the way through the piece to the end.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.694
If you practice it that way, you're always going to lose energy.

20:43.935 --> 20:51.426
But if you start at the end and stay with it, and don't even think about that beginning for a while, you're going to give a lot more to your beginning in the end.

20:51.826 --> 20:55.812
So you have the bookends, as we've described them, and you have these characters.

20:56.673 --> 21:00.799
Now, did they just start causing mischief on their own at some point?

21:01.032 --> 21:02.213
Well, you know, I never get it.

21:02.573 --> 21:04.515
That's the thing I don't get.

21:04.535 --> 21:08.279
When people say, I couldn't control my characters, they just took me over, you know.

21:08.299 --> 21:12.984
But I feel like I'm always, like, really controlling these people.

21:14.625 --> 21:25.115
Maybe it's just a wishful sort of control freak type of thing, but I just feel like the best part of this is when I get them to do what I want them to do.

21:25.155 --> 21:30.921
And I'm always kind of wrestling them into shape, you know.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.266
Are you one of these artists who hears the voices?

21:34.348 --> 21:35.891
Well, that happens, yeah.

21:35.951 --> 21:49.454
If I'm really lucky, if I'm really concentrating, I get myself in a kind of... I set up my writing place with... I had this photograph the whole time sitting up in front of me.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.136
My friend did it.

21:51.057 --> 21:56.166
I just had everything around it that would remind me of these characters, and...

21:57.850 --> 22:07.904
Every so often, it happens less and less as I get older as a writer, and that a voice will just step in.

22:09.146 --> 22:15.855
And I start more and more seeing things with the omniscient perspective.

22:16.817 --> 22:22.505
But when I was a younger writer, I would always hear the voices as though they were talking to me.

22:22.525 --> 22:24.988
It doesn't happen as much anymore.

22:25.762 --> 22:33.891
You started as a poet, and there has been a subsequent collection of poetry, I guess.

22:33.911 --> 22:34.934
Now you're doing stories.

22:35.336 --> 22:36.359
I know some stories.

22:36.801 --> 22:37.965
Poetry still?

22:38.401 --> 22:40.564
I do poetry, yeah.

22:40.604 --> 22:43.288
Does it help you with fiction?

22:43.308 --> 22:49.196
I don't know where that comes from, but I think that's the voice.

22:49.216 --> 22:54.644
I think that I stopped for many years, and then it's sort of like the music.

22:54.664 --> 23:04.999
I missed having those voices just ride into my consciousness and not really know where they were coming from.

23:05.620 --> 23:18.676
So I thought, well, I'm just going to start, I'm going to stop assigning myself work for a while, which I was doing, you know, in order to write books that I'd figured out I wanted to write.

23:19.136 --> 23:26.145
I'm just going to be at the mercy of the gods or whatever.

23:26.345 --> 23:30.850
Do you see, do you visualize your writer's piece, an idea of reading the books?

23:31.871 --> 23:34.935
Well, you know, from going on these things, I have a good idea.

23:35.624 --> 23:37.506
of the range of people who do read, I think.

23:37.847 --> 23:41.851
But maybe these are only people who come to readings or bookstores or whatever.

23:42.812 --> 23:51.442
And often, you know, I really do write to see what Michael's going to think a lot of the time.

23:51.522 --> 23:53.284
He's an ideal reader.

23:53.945 --> 23:56.168
He's got a very critical mind.

23:57.009 --> 24:03.336
And so to impress him, it's always this big task, you know.

24:03.485 --> 24:19.059
But I also find it very hard to be in a situation where I'm going to meet a lot of readers, and I really don't write for anybody at all, except not even myself.

24:19.440 --> 24:25.205
It's more that I write just because I have to do it.

24:25.285 --> 24:31.591
Are you still allowed to Michael, or at what point do you find that it's good enough to pass along?

24:31.771 --> 24:32.732
It always changes.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.465
Parts of this I didn't, and parts I did.

24:36.106 --> 24:42.055
It really is something that there's no, we don't have a real plan in mind.

24:42.135 --> 24:49.867
I mean, sometimes it's very private, and I just want to keep to myself, and sometimes I'm eager to show it and share it.

24:50.107 --> 24:59.801
Did you, I'm sure that, I've only read one review of the book so far, and it's very compliant with the book review.

24:59.821 --> 25:03.006
Of course, is it a,

25:03.138 --> 25:05.041
a statement at all?

25:06.222 --> 25:13.251
There's been characters that certainly are for women, and male is decidedly offstage someplace.

25:13.392 --> 25:14.092
Oh, you think so?

25:14.553 --> 25:22.123
Well, no, not really, but I mean, in terms of being in the van and stuff like that.

25:23.625 --> 25:23.986
Yeah.

25:24.006 --> 25:31.896
I don't know what I'm asking, the kind of question I'm asking, but is it a novel that takes any kind of position

25:32.669 --> 25:36.835
gender relationships, let's say.

25:37.055 --> 25:37.536
Is that a question?

25:37.616 --> 25:40.640
Yeah, does it take a... You can just enter that.

25:40.660 --> 25:41.020
Enter it.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.703
I don't think so.

25:42.843 --> 25:46.548
I just couldn't, I can't figure it out.

25:46.608 --> 25:56.381
I mean, and that's the, I think, the beauty of it all is that you can spend your time thinking about it, and you don't figure it out.

25:56.401 --> 25:56.922
I had a

25:57.290 --> 25:58.952
I mean, it's not a male-bashing novel.

25:59.172 --> 26:00.374
No.

26:00.554 --> 26:01.716
I don't think so.

26:02.657 --> 26:06.642
But it's also not a women's buddy novel, you know.

26:07.063 --> 26:25.407
It's a combination of... I hope it talks about the complexity and the mystery of love, because I haven't figured it out through this writing it.

26:26.348 --> 26:45.834
All I know is that it's so powerful that you can't politicize it or control it, and it's one of the things that, you know... Do you consider this more, would you say, your most conventional novel of the five that you've written so far?

26:45.874 --> 26:52.322
I thought Trax was really more conventional in its form, except that this has that traditional...

26:52.741 --> 27:06.577
It certainly is the most ... It took me the longest to write, I suppose.

27:06.917 --> 27:07.137
Did it?

27:07.958 --> 27:08.219
Yeah.

27:08.419 --> 27:12.624
I thought of that title way back in 78, and then I just kept adding to it.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.946
It was like a box.

27:15.027 --> 27:19.812
I was just going to keep putting things in, and I stopped every so often to do something else.

27:20.315 --> 27:23.178
So this really wasn't written in a rush, in any way.

27:23.198 --> 27:26.060
In other words, it became... Right.

27:26.260 --> 27:28.262
You put this aside, and you go to something else?

27:28.282 --> 27:30.324
Yeah, I keep kind of... Well, why?

27:30.344 --> 27:31.686
Problems with it?

27:31.986 --> 27:42.956
No, I, you know, I, for one thing, that revision of Love Medicine, I found that stuff, and I had to get that put back, and I had stuff that... And then that led to Bingo Palace.

27:43.016 --> 27:49.562
And then I, yeah, then that led to the Bingo Palace, and then I wanted to do this memoir of writing and

27:50.099 --> 27:53.923
having babies before the children got to be, you know, in their 20s.

27:53.943 --> 27:56.485
So I had to do that.

27:56.505 --> 27:59.688
And then I finally came back to this.

27:59.708 --> 28:00.308
Finished it up.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.111
What are you working on now?

28:03.311 --> 28:19.566
Well, stories, but then also I'm working on a novel that takes place, what it actually is, is a series of letters to the Pope that a reservation priest has written through the years.

28:20.643 --> 28:23.987
and never received an answer, so it's called The Last Report.

28:24.007 --> 28:48.574
He's done reports on all of these occurrences up on the reservation, that's sort of the central place in love medicine, and he's very tired of not receiving answers from Rome, and so he's decided to make one last report on the miracles at Little No Horse, and in doing so, explains a lot of the things that do happen in

28:48.824 --> 28:49.405
Love Medicine.

28:49.605 --> 28:53.691
He's been the confessor for the whole reservation for a hundred years now, really.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.215
You got a title for that?

28:56.235 --> 28:59.340
It's the last report on the miracles at Little No Horse.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.246
I'm loving to start this one.

29:04.027 --> 29:06.651
That's going to be the interview thing.

29:07.152 --> 29:08.013
I've got to do it.

29:08.073 --> 29:09.015
It's from Wisconsin.

29:09.035 --> 29:12.320
What were we saying?

29:12.961 --> 29:14.643
I've got a lot of stuff, too, so don't worry.

29:14.663 --> 29:15.424
I've got the books.

29:15.465 --> 29:16.186
That's what matters.

29:16.827 --> 29:17.768
I read the books.

29:18.372 --> 29:22.417
Fiction writers, it's hard, but it's easy.

29:22.658 --> 29:25.702
The interview is hard because I hate to ask you what the book is about.

29:25.742 --> 29:26.523
That's my job.

29:27.083 --> 29:34.713
But on the other hand, it's hard because then you want to find other things to talk about that are interesting as well.

29:34.914 --> 29:38.338
You're telling me something.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.553
Don't worry about it.

29:42.613 --> 29:44.155
Yeah, we were talking about it.

29:44.436 --> 29:57.759
I will say that the element of chance is, if we're looking for themes that do recur in your work, and we're talking about coincidence, maybe the better discussion is chance.

29:58.119 --> 29:58.941
Maybe it's chance.

29:59.001 --> 30:03.208
You know, the whole Bingo Palace had a... Really, that's what I'm thinking.

30:03.268 --> 30:03.970
The gambling.

30:04.030 --> 30:05.372
Yeah, yeah.

30:06.010 --> 30:08.754
And you look back... What a metaphor for chance.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.817
I mean, it's something you're talking about.

30:11.498 --> 30:12.640
Sure.

30:12.960 --> 30:24.437
And then in this book, you know, Marlis is saying, they're talking about the afterlife and, you know, Marlis' whole metaphor is welcome to the casino.

30:24.478 --> 30:26.280
You know, the house always wins in the end.

30:26.360 --> 30:33.331
And, you know, you're just in this for as long as the house decides you're in it.

30:33.531 --> 30:34.212
You're not in it.

30:34.664 --> 30:38.169
with any control over your destiny, really, or your life.

30:40.892 --> 30:42.294
No, I love games of chance.

30:42.314 --> 30:51.126
I always lose, but, you know, I love the metaphor that they... There's always card games going on, and... And you use a couple on your dedication page.

30:51.146 --> 30:53.489
You do have a couple of the hearts.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.954
Yeah, Jack and the Queen, and Michael didn't want to be the king.

30:58.456 --> 30:59.317
Let me be the queen.

30:59.537 --> 31:00.218
He was a jack.

31:00.238 --> 31:00.719
That's great.

31:00.919 --> 31:01.180
Yeah.

31:01.200 --> 31:01.801
I like that.

31:01.821 --> 31:03.583
And I'm trying to get it there as I get it.

31:03.603 --> 31:04.384
It's from the...

31:04.718 --> 31:05.820
Yeah.

31:06.261 --> 31:16.177
Well, it was also, I was going to make it, you know, I was going to make it a natural, you know, like when you pretend you want an ace and a queen and you, you don't want that either.

31:16.297 --> 31:18.000
You want to be the Jack.

31:18.020 --> 31:18.942
That's great.

31:18.962 --> 31:19.062
Yeah.

31:19.082 --> 31:28.718
And of course, Jack, you're talking about Jack, he certainly, he does have a child, but I mean, he certainly doesn't populate the world with his children.

31:29.035 --> 31:29.876
Thank God, no.

31:32.019 --> 31:35.123
Or else would there be any honest contractors.

31:35.223 --> 31:37.706
Yeah, but you need another generation of characters.

31:37.726 --> 31:45.516
Yeah, but then I'm stuck with them like this Sean, you know, she, the Jerry's daughter, I had, then you have to work out their destinies.

31:47.218 --> 31:51.443
So yeah, there's this kid, but I also, I couldn't handle too many.

31:51.483 --> 31:56.730
There was just, there was getting to be, I really have never had a cast of characters

31:57.925 --> 31:59.167
quite as large, I think.

31:59.247 --> 32:01.170
Maybe that's, well, maybe I have, but I haven't.

32:01.190 --> 32:02.412
Do you keep track of them all?

32:03.093 --> 32:04.916
Do you have a chart?

32:04.936 --> 32:06.919
Yeah, a lot of, a lot of charts.

32:06.939 --> 32:10.104
For one of your books, they said the press kit, which I have, you know.

32:10.124 --> 32:10.425
Really?

32:10.465 --> 32:11.546
With the chart.

32:11.566 --> 32:12.067
Oh.

32:12.087 --> 32:13.389
Do you remember that, for tracks?

32:13.469 --> 32:14.471
For tracks, yeah.

32:14.491 --> 32:15.833
I think Blanche

32:16.083 --> 32:16.944
I figured that one out.

32:16.964 --> 32:17.505
Yeah.

32:17.525 --> 32:18.987
I've saved all of this stuff.

32:19.008 --> 32:19.829
Geez.

32:19.849 --> 32:20.890
I didn't remember that.

32:21.091 --> 32:21.952
Well, it's nice.

32:21.972 --> 32:24.957
It's a nice piece of ephemera.

32:24.977 --> 32:25.958
Ephemera, yeah.

32:26.179 --> 32:27.240
Because it just changes.

32:27.320 --> 32:33.750
And now I have a... I've kind of paled up with... Michael has it in his head.

32:33.790 --> 32:34.431
I have it in my head.

32:34.912 --> 32:42.404
And then the guy who was mentioned in the beginning, Trent Duffy, has it all on this computer thing.

32:42.424 --> 32:43.305
And you can access it.

32:44.551 --> 32:45.452
You got a database.

32:45.652 --> 32:46.453
I got a database.

32:46.473 --> 32:46.794
Is that right?

32:46.994 --> 32:47.755
He's got it all.

32:47.775 --> 32:48.936
Yeah, he did it.

32:48.956 --> 32:53.362
There's no chance of killing somebody off and then writing about them later, you know, when they're dead, I mean.

32:54.043 --> 32:57.947
Well, I made a lot of strange errors that have led to plot.

32:59.269 --> 33:02.553
I mean, that's the thing with this interconnected kind of thing.

33:02.573 --> 33:09.441
You then, you have to just, you know, I stay up and I wake up at night thinking, how do I resolve this?

33:09.461 --> 33:12.465
And it really does lead some of the plot stuff

33:12.682 --> 33:19.690
is this Rube Goldberg kind of stuff, trying to explain how the character in a former book got to be in that situation.

33:21.032 --> 33:27.899
And I haven't asked you any of the questions you've asked dozens of times about writing Native American tradition and all that stuff.

33:27.919 --> 33:28.680
I think we've done that.

33:28.860 --> 33:30.442
Yeah, we've probably done that.

33:30.663 --> 33:35.428
I think it's been done.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.811
It is interesting, though, that your first book, nobody wanted it.

33:37.891 --> 33:38.471
Isn't that right?

33:38.952 --> 33:40.714
Because it was considered it.

33:41.977 --> 33:43.618
Because it was considered like, who cares?

33:45.560 --> 33:47.602
That's the same thing Bill Kennedy ran into.

33:47.622 --> 33:48.783
Right.

33:48.803 --> 33:52.166
They told him who was interested in a bunch of mums in Albany.

33:52.186 --> 33:52.506
Right.

33:53.247 --> 33:53.768
Really.

33:54.168 --> 33:56.490
They wouldn't read the book.

33:56.910 --> 33:57.311
Right.

33:57.491 --> 33:57.971
Yeah.

33:58.532 --> 33:59.573
No, that was true.

34:01.274 --> 34:07.200
Sorry, but there was also some odd stuff.

34:07.220 --> 34:11.123
I'm almost forgetting this.

34:12.352 --> 34:14.195
restructure it so it happens.

34:14.356 --> 34:21.669
A lot of stuff that probably every writer comes up against it.

34:23.833 --> 34:35.153
It's interesting being here because the first kind of, I don't know, the kind of dream of

34:35.875 --> 34:37.437
It wasn't even a dream.

34:37.457 --> 34:40.901
I never knew this was possible, but remember the Atlantic Monthlies to be down here?

34:40.921 --> 34:44.746
C. Michael Curtis.

34:46.588 --> 34:46.909
Do you know?

34:46.949 --> 34:50.133
He's still the editor there.

34:50.433 --> 35:04.110
I kept sending, I kept shooting him every version of everything that came in, and finally he kind of, he just, wham, he just took one, and I was as stunned as could be.

35:05.052 --> 35:08.836
But that was this...it was St.

35:08.876 --> 35:14.982
Marie, it was from the Law of Medicine, and I think he really kind of took a chance on that.

35:15.002 --> 35:27.554
There was not much written about the virulent forms of Catholicism, missionized Catholicism, and I think he's a religious man.

35:28.034 --> 35:34.080
I think people, because of the fact that the first four novels are based

35:34.533 --> 35:37.237
on the reservation, so to speak.

35:37.257 --> 35:39.020
Yeah.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.404
People think that this is maybe all you should know.

35:41.664 --> 35:47.554
The fact is you're comfortable in any number of different... Oh, yeah.

35:47.574 --> 35:50.859
I mean, my background is so mixed.

35:50.939 --> 35:52.101
And you don't have to tell it to me.

35:52.121 --> 35:52.401
I know.

35:52.482 --> 35:52.922
No.

35:53.002 --> 35:53.663
You know the whole thing.

35:53.703 --> 35:55.326
I mean, I...

35:55.795 --> 36:17.650
Also, there's a mixture of people in them, but I think the Native stuff is the hook that, and I think it's largely academy-driven because people want to, it's taught to students in Native American literature courses, or in women's, or, you know, there's some little... I'd love to go on an academy trip.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.352
I'm going to ask you to describe these.

36:19.373 --> 36:19.693
Sure.

36:20.197 --> 36:21.418
I'll just shut this off.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.201
I'll get this, if you don't mind.

36:23.221 --> 36:23.581
Go ahead.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.123
Oh, sure.

36:25.143 --> 36:28.727
I was going to say that transfers thing.

36:30.409 --> 36:34.114
For me, it's the reason I have all my books in a handwritten version.

36:34.354 --> 36:43.645
I like to have my handwriting there before me again, so it proves to me that I actually sat and wrote it with my own hands.

36:46.549 --> 36:49.292
I go back to the beginning of

36:49.643 --> 36:50.824
love medicine that's written on.

36:50.864 --> 36:55.209
I like old paper, so I can sometimes write on old paper.

36:56.390 --> 37:05.118
Friends send me old sheaves of telegraph paper.

37:05.679 --> 37:06.600
I've got old notebooks.

37:07.681 --> 37:15.629
The old stuff before there was acid in it, it's still fine, and so I've got stuff that's written on these big old ledgers.

37:16.369 --> 37:18.992
And then I start adding

37:20.170 --> 37:29.862
I start adding photographs to it, and I start making my... My book has to be my book before it can be anybody else's book, you know.

37:29.882 --> 37:30.482
This is good.

37:31.083 --> 37:31.644
Oh, good.

37:31.724 --> 37:32.284
I use this.

37:32.545 --> 37:32.865
This is good.

37:32.905 --> 37:33.626
Well, good.

37:33.866 --> 37:34.107
Go ahead.

37:34.127 --> 37:34.587
It's good.

37:34.868 --> 37:35.168
Yeah.

37:35.849 --> 37:42.897
No, because it's... I'm trying to... Because the final chapter is... I'm really concerned... What is computers going to do?

37:42.937 --> 37:44.659
What are computers going to do?

37:44.679 --> 37:45.580
I want to do that, too.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.401
To create a process.

37:46.441 --> 37:47.022
Yeah.

37:47.356 --> 37:47.837
I don't know.

37:47.877 --> 37:49.038
I'm going to try and find out.

37:49.138 --> 37:52.922
You know, I'm going to go see Maurice Sendak, who has all this stuff.

37:52.942 --> 37:58.749
I mean, he has extraordinary collections and how it affects his tree, whatever he does.

37:58.769 --> 38:00.431
And I hope to see Susan Sante.

38:00.491 --> 38:04.656
I'd like to go to find out just how much of her books are in her.

38:04.676 --> 38:05.176
Yeah, yeah.

38:05.196 --> 38:12.705
You know, I eventually get to the computer, but I've got all my manuscripts, like, huddled around me.

38:13.107 --> 38:15.852
in boxes and books and notebooks.

38:16.373 --> 38:18.296
I'm looking for more women for this book.

38:18.957 --> 38:20.079
Come visit.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.004
Do you have a field box or a phone number?

38:23.044 --> 38:24.687
I can reach you through Jane or something.

38:24.707 --> 38:24.968
Sure.

38:25.829 --> 38:29.616
My phone is 612-377-3812.

38:30.397 --> 38:34.845
I'd love to know what other writers do with this because it just...

38:35.551 --> 38:37.934
It gets to you after a while.

38:38.054 --> 38:53.350
You feel like the closet... I don't even know where it's going.

38:53.390 --> 39:04.562
I just want to go and talk with them and just see.

39:05.504 --> 39:09.397
I do love writing this kind of book.

39:09.577 --> 39:13.751
I have a wonderful proposal and it's very detailed with a fabulous content.

39:14.112 --> 39:19.108
I don't know where it's going.

39:20.202 --> 39:32.058
It was one of your books where they changed a couple of the priorities.

39:32.839 --> 39:41.451
I mean, just for me, my sense is that it was either a legal problem or it didn't fit in.

39:41.785 --> 40:03.469
No, no, you can put it on the record.

40:03.589 --> 40:07.573
It's fever.

40:08.600 --> 40:33.690
Well, that was what it was.

40:33.710 --> 40:37.474
Isn't that nice?

40:37.495 --> 40:37.915
Thank you.

40:38.722 --> 40:59.236
They did the poem, didn't they do, they did the background.

40:59.256 --> 41:02.481
Wonderful.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.042
I remember.

41:03.646 --> 41:07.778
You know, because my book is very large, and it's just funny this week.

41:08.159 --> 41:12.452
That $35 book is like $60,000.

41:12.472 --> 41:15.159
It's not bad, but that's how poor books are.

41:15.179 --> 41:17.807
You know, it seems better today, you know, he's doing...

41:18.327 --> 41:27.986
And I'm talking in all the libraries at the Captain and Harvard and the Library of Congress, and, you know, and I don't want to worry if it's irrelevant, and the topics are going on media.

41:28.447 --> 41:37.585
It's a powerful thing, you know, it's how it takes you away from your work, but you really are connecting with these people, and you do get it, and I do find the Antiquarian Book Fair.

41:38.054 --> 41:41.660
And one of the things I do is talk about the lines and get out of here.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.907
I want to know who you are, what brought you to my book, what do you like?

41:46.368 --> 41:48.671
And I write something personal, and I'll say, do you mind?

41:48.691 --> 41:50.194
And they say, no, keep going.

41:50.895 --> 41:52.678
Do you mind that I take a little time?

41:52.738 --> 41:54.901
And I really want to know each person.

41:54.961 --> 41:56.604
And it's like you said in one of your interviews.

41:56.865 --> 41:59.248
You go to one of these independent book stories.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.033
These people want to come and talk.

42:02.133 --> 42:04.517
I was signing in New York last week, I remember.

42:04.818 --> 42:11.972
A few of people have come up with one guy on a carland.

42:12.974 --> 42:15.459
One guy on a carland restaurant.

42:15.479 --> 42:18.405
He gave me the disease.

42:18.622 --> 42:25.852
I wrote it down, I took a card, and he said, I want to invite you to my left hand.

42:25.912 --> 42:30.118
Bring your life, bring your daughters, you know, and you gave me the disease.

42:30.438 --> 42:36.526
It's a part of my book of Implementer Madness, and it's about, you know, the delivery of many lives.

42:36.546 --> 42:37.588
One after the other.

42:37.608 --> 42:44.457
I mean, it's been very humbling after a while, because you're lying, it's been a year for this time.

42:44.477 --> 42:45.979
And I was in publicers, I was in orphaned, I was in

42:46.330 --> 42:51.817
I had been thrown out of London's house, ceremonially well, for no reason.

42:51.837 --> 42:57.985
I was in the practice, it was too long, and I would, my relative, return to another house.

42:58.265 --> 43:01.429
I don't know, it took me another year to sell the book.

43:01.449 --> 43:06.415
But things worked right, you know, things worked out for the fact, over there.

43:07.205 --> 43:09.709
I don't care about that.

43:09.729 --> 43:10.511
It's just that.

43:10.531 --> 43:29.803
It's a book pool, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, you know, a thousand-year-old, and a thousand-year-old, and a thousand-year-old, and a thousand-year-old, you know.

43:30.273 --> 43:33.340
And they did that in the books.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.005
They always gave me a whole window in New York.

43:36.025 --> 43:38.591
They said it's so beautiful at some point.

43:38.611 --> 43:40.976
And people understood buying more now.

43:42.319 --> 43:44.383
That's how good they sell them.

43:45.612 --> 43:50.860
That's well, I mean, it's magnificent, yeah.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.804
I said, this is the traffic.

43:53.824 --> 43:58.912
And I guess I brought a car, but I gave him the original illustrations, and it's got the decorations.

43:58.932 --> 44:04.380
But she just took that, and this.

44:04.698 --> 44:15.229
makes me feel, and I've never met her, I've never talked to her, you know, but I've left a hundred people at me, you know, and I won't, and she looked at it and skipped it, and I said, you are over here after the stream.

44:15.670 --> 44:19.180
You really are, because you just did something, she made it look like,

44:19.497 --> 44:22.520
a handful of leather bindings.

44:23.220 --> 44:26.043
It's an old, you know, old stuff to do with that.

44:26.543 --> 44:30.447
I mean, there's your, there's such a lot of logos, a librarian and stuff.

44:31.488 --> 44:32.568
They gave these end sheets.

44:33.409 --> 44:34.450
They didn't have to do it.

44:34.470 --> 44:36.772
They gave these two signatures, these photos instead of one.

44:37.693 --> 44:42.417
They did these end notes and regular-sized types, not all that interesting.

44:42.497 --> 44:45.320
It's over 638 pages.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.183
I mean, so when it came time, and I'm writing this, and then the book gets

44:49.619 --> 44:56.388
I got a terrific proposal for a companion work.

44:56.408 --> 44:58.471
You use that word, and that's my word.

44:58.791 --> 45:01.895
You've got a few more people, but, you know, it's a payment.

45:02.175 --> 45:09.665
It's not going to be collecting, it's not going to be a collection, it's going to be a culture.

45:09.685 --> 45:12.229
I'm going to go to, I'm going to make it a little clear through history.

45:12.309 --> 45:18.597
I'm going to go to maybe this library that has been so significant through history, just for one opening chapter, I'll go to Ephesus.

45:18.830 --> 45:19.652
and then go to St.

45:19.712 --> 45:38.374
Galliard, amongst the copies of all the books, and then go to Patmos in the region, a 900-year-old monastic library, uninterrupted, amongst the documents, a copy of the manuscript for 900 years, taken, uh, Armenians, Armenians, on an island, off his head.

45:39.181 --> 45:48.492
you know, preserving the history of our years.

45:49.474 --> 45:52.898
I love it.

45:52.918 --> 45:53.819
I interviewed him.

45:53.839 --> 45:54.640
He wrote a blurb.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.183
He wrote a blurb for my book, which he didn't use any blurb.

45:57.523 --> 46:02.429
But Tom Stato said my book was, he just went bananas over it.

46:02.489 --> 46:07.956
He gave up this to me that's the right thing that's spectacular.

46:08.527 --> 46:12.894
You know, the idea was I got the book collected, I got the scholars, I got the librarians.

46:13.054 --> 46:18.383
I said, no, I don't want Yale.

46:19.524 --> 46:20.306
I want people.

46:20.326 --> 46:21.447
I want a place where I live.

46:21.467 --> 46:22.229
I've got children.

46:22.369 --> 46:23.491
I've got a life.

46:23.691 --> 46:24.793
I've got a house.

46:24.893 --> 46:26.856
I've got to be able to live in here.

46:27.005 --> 46:28.587
There's no shame in making a living.

46:29.107 --> 46:34.372
You didn't hear me say, I love it when people say, we'll even join a commercial with this book.

46:34.392 --> 46:35.593
What the hell are you supposed to do?

46:35.613 --> 46:37.015
What are you doing this for?

46:37.035 --> 46:37.395
I don't know.

46:37.415 --> 46:38.576
What does that mean, I wonder?

46:38.656 --> 46:40.158
I'm not asking for the record.

46:40.218 --> 46:41.459
I don't want the answers to that.

46:41.539 --> 46:44.602
I think that's something, actually, without the respect.

46:44.622 --> 46:49.807
The CW gave you a glorious review, and then they said, her most commercial book, yes.

46:50.528 --> 46:52.530
What did they mean by that?

46:52.550 --> 46:53.451
Do you think that's her most commercial book?

46:53.819 --> 46:59.044
No, I haven't, but... He's got a great time on this stuff.

46:59.064 --> 47:01.306
I mean, he's just right out there.

47:01.326 --> 47:03.248
You know, I'm going to try it.

47:03.268 --> 47:05.930
I mean, I didn't think I ever made it.

47:05.950 --> 47:06.771
You know, I don't know.

47:06.791 --> 47:07.312
My agent called yesterday.

47:07.412 --> 47:11.396
I finally said, I didn't know of yesterday.

47:11.416 --> 47:12.497
Oh, my, my, my, my next book.

47:13.177 --> 47:16.701
And my first therapy truck came out in July of last year.

47:16.721 --> 47:18.002
Yeah, I finally gave eight.

47:19.003 --> 47:21.345
And he gave me the number, I mean, and, uh,

47:21.832 --> 47:23.214
You know, that's not too easy.

47:23.254 --> 47:30.004
My wife, God blesses them working and doing this, and we've got our kids in private school, and she would say we chose them to do it.

47:30.905 --> 47:34.670
But we're in depth, you know, and I would have said we're not.

47:34.790 --> 47:36.473
And what am I supposed to say?

47:36.493 --> 47:41.159
I could have gone with Yale and sold the final copies in my book.

47:41.179 --> 47:43.062
This is what I do.

47:43.242 --> 47:44.464
I don't understand it.

47:44.697 --> 47:56.073
It's the text, you know, and I've got to find it.

47:57.515 --> 48:14.518
See, there's supposedly a point at MIT that I understand there was a study of four years ago

48:15.173 --> 48:28.534
where, I mean, there's lots of MIT people who will tell you that the same text on a computer screen is different, has different insights, is negative from people, and it goes in the book.

48:28.594 --> 48:41.734
I mean, how you read a printed page, what you read in the printed page is different from what you read on a manuscript page and also on a computer screen.

48:41.754 --> 48:42.936
Oh, I believe that.

48:43.675 --> 48:56.475
We would have a good case in the Museum of Florida, and I don't even have a portable computer, so it was, well, we fell in my hands.

48:56.675 --> 48:59.059
And people tell me, it was different.

48:59.239 --> 49:02.865
Well, I mean, I do write a computer, because it is how it is.

49:04.398 --> 49:27.790
Thank you.

50:20.032 --> 50:26.413
Thank you.

50:50.693 --> 51:09.495
Bobby Lowe, come out, please.

51:09.712 --> 51:26.995
I'm going up.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.807
Hello.

53:49.990 --> 53:51.776
.

53:51.796 --> 53:51.816
.

54:02.123 --> 54:25.414
Thank you.

54:27.014 --> 54:50.322
Thank you

54:56.039 --> 55:06.167
Thank you.

55:08.341 --> 55:11.527
.

55:11.547 --> 55:13.931
.

55:15.514 --> 55:27.615
.

55:27.595 --> 55:51.662
Hi, what is the Cascade and Jewel?

56:01.345 --> 56:07.826
Sorry.

56:10.375 --> 56:10.495
Sorry.

56:14.525 --> 56:41.545
Thank you.

56:41.525 --> 56:58.098
You taught English?

56:58.118 --> 56:59.341
Are you a doctor anyway?

56:59.361 --> 57:00.563
Yeah, I am.

57:01.403 --> 57:15.935
This one there?

57:15.955 --> 57:17.779
Yeah, the police.

57:17.799 --> 57:18.140
Yeah, the police.

57:18.160 --> 57:18.501
Yeah, the police.

57:18.481 --> 57:37.603
Thank you very much.

57:38.562 --> 57:50.238
Uh, call?

57:57.048 --> 57:57.128
Yep.

57:57.108 --> 58:14.678
Thank you.

59:00.524 --> 59:03.255
.

59:03.275 --> 59:03.295
.

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.965
Heaven.

01:00:42.985 --> 01:00:43.127
Heaven.
