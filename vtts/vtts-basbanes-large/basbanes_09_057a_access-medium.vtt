00:02.765 --> 00:03.526
Hello.

00:03.546 --> 00:05.247
I just want to see how this picks up.

00:05.568 --> 00:06.449
Hi there.

00:06.689 --> 00:07.189
Okay.

00:07.349 --> 00:08.851
We pronounce your name Chute, right?

00:08.871 --> 00:09.191
Right.

00:09.411 --> 00:09.992
I thought so, yeah.

00:10.012 --> 00:11.113
It's not Chute, it's Chute.

00:11.133 --> 00:13.215
We're talking with Carolyn Chute, and we're in Boston.

00:13.275 --> 00:14.296
I'm going to just put this here.

00:15.037 --> 00:16.038
I don't even think about it.

00:16.098 --> 00:16.959
All right, it's just there.

00:19.001 --> 00:19.381
Okay.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.705
Well, congratulations on your new book.

00:23.725 --> 00:24.506
Thank you.

00:24.686 --> 00:28.890
And when the last book came out, which was a few years ago,

00:29.478 --> 00:32.603
You were still kind of living in the same house.

00:32.703 --> 00:33.525
Have you moved?

00:33.705 --> 00:35.288
How's your life changed, I guess?

00:35.308 --> 00:36.530
How would life start?

00:36.550 --> 00:37.671
A few more gray hairs.

00:38.373 --> 00:41.157
I have to wear my glasses now and have some back trouble.

00:42.519 --> 00:43.882
And two more grandkids.

00:43.902 --> 00:46.266
Oh, congratulations.

00:46.286 --> 00:47.588
Do you have electricity?

00:47.648 --> 00:50.052
I remember before you didn't even have electricity in the house.

00:50.613 --> 00:51.274
You're all set.

00:51.434 --> 00:52.997
We've always had electricity.

00:53.197 --> 00:56.262
One of the stories I read was that... Yeah, don't believe anything you read in the newspaper.

00:56.815 --> 00:57.395
No.

00:57.416 --> 00:57.996
No.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.637
I don't know what happens.

00:59.818 --> 01:03.661
Something happens between interviews and print.

01:03.681 --> 01:04.762
I'm not sure what it is.

01:06.223 --> 01:19.554
I think it kind of made for a good story for some of them to make you out to be... Instead of talking about the book, they would like to talk about, you know, I don't know.

01:19.574 --> 01:21.356
Something that... I don't know what they did.

01:22.677 --> 01:24.758
Don't worry about it.

01:24.899 --> 01:26.620
Are you going to continue to write about Egypt?

01:27.680 --> 01:34.791
How is this, do you think, is this a cycle that you pretty well destroyed now in these three books?

01:34.811 --> 01:39.138
Well, if you mean you think it's the end of the world, yeah, probably it is, and I probably won't have another book.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.541
It's probably the end of the world.

01:41.922 --> 01:46.549
No, I mean, on this particular set in this area that you created Egypt, Maine.

01:47.270 --> 01:55.122
Well, I mean, I did make up a town, because I didn't want to have people say, you know, such and such a street isn't

01:55.625 --> 01:57.607
I don't want to be corrected.

01:57.627 --> 01:58.828
I want to just have freedom.

02:00.570 --> 02:04.593
Just like I make up characters and scenes, if you do that, you have total freedom.

02:04.834 --> 02:08.217
And I guess that's the nice thing about creative writing is total freedom.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.639
Other than that, I didn't really make up anything.

02:10.679 --> 02:22.510
I mean, the situation was cultural and economic in this country, in my state, everywhere is real.

02:23.030 --> 02:25.855
I watch it, and I write about what I see.

02:27.237 --> 02:34.068
But so whatever books that you continue to write, you think you will still set in each of the names?

02:35.610 --> 02:38.675
I guess, I mean, yeah, sure.

02:38.715 --> 02:39.757
Oh, it's ticking.

02:40.378 --> 02:48.531
I guess, you know, the scene at the end of the book, that future scene,

02:49.878 --> 02:52.221
I guess I'm kind of worried.

02:52.441 --> 02:59.309
As I work on the next book, you know how a book takes three, four, five years to work on.

02:59.329 --> 03:06.637
I could see a lot of possible change in the way things are, particularly for anyone.

03:06.677 --> 03:08.760
And for writers, I don't know.

03:08.780 --> 03:14.907
Will there be a publishing of fiction in five or six years?

03:15.207 --> 03:17.012
because it's being cut out so much.

03:17.032 --> 03:17.312
Terrible.

03:17.333 --> 03:20.461
Like Cork Smith, who's your editor?

03:20.641 --> 03:22.085
It was one of six.

03:22.185 --> 03:27.359
I mean, if you have to ask them for details, it was something like one of six, and they're doing mostly European fiction now.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.246
You know, I think that foreign fiction is

03:31.154 --> 03:38.206
And I just, and I heard, I knew of two others, Tickerman Fields was dropped, and McMillan dropped theirs.

03:38.226 --> 03:45.178
Yeah, and a guy told me yesterday that he heard of one yesterday that was just a big publishing house that dropped their fiction.

03:45.198 --> 03:45.799
I don't remember.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.882
I don't remember what Tony said.

03:48.123 --> 03:48.523
Wow.

03:49.044 --> 03:54.874
They just dropped it, because fiction is, you know, they're trimming back.

03:54.894 --> 03:55.475
It's terrible.

03:55.495 --> 03:56.757
The investors want growth.

03:57.192 --> 03:57.973
in every quarter.

03:58.354 --> 04:06.485
I sit here by myself a lot in these hotels, and I listen to these guys talk on the phone, talking at dinner, you know, at the restaurants, and they go, yeah, we took the stocks out of that.

04:06.685 --> 04:11.732
And when they're talking about their stocks, it's like there's nothing to do with the businesses themselves.

04:11.932 --> 04:12.954
Is it something they believe in?

04:12.994 --> 04:14.956
Is it something they'd like to see growth in?

04:15.016 --> 04:16.779
Is it something to do with people they care about?

04:17.119 --> 04:20.063
No, it's just this sort of rush.

04:20.123 --> 04:22.146
It's like gambling.

04:22.206 --> 04:23.568
It's like roulette or something.

04:23.588 --> 04:25.731
I mean, they're just playing with numbers, right?

04:25.964 --> 04:29.147
And our lives are at stake while they're doing this.

04:29.167 --> 04:34.051
And to answer to them, businesses have to come back.

04:35.092 --> 04:36.193
And let people go.

04:36.253 --> 04:38.515
Let people go, cheapen their products, raise the prices.

04:39.115 --> 04:55.549
And if, you know, the idea of calculus is that this rate, if you think about how fast inflation's going, the guys are being laid off, and this and this, I mean, wow, I mean, it's pretty creepy.

04:55.867 --> 04:57.309
So I could see why this happened.

04:57.549 --> 04:59.312
I mean, I've been frustrated with that.

04:59.432 --> 05:03.838
I'm closer to the working people, and I've seen my whole state wiped out by companies.

05:03.858 --> 05:21.243
If there isn't a union, it's a lot easier for them, but they just have a company come in, create a parent company, bleed all the assets out into a parent company through administrative fees, and then lay off older machines and so forth.

05:21.263 --> 05:23.646
They lay them all off and reopen

05:24.487 --> 05:27.410
to hire young guys part-time.

05:27.430 --> 05:27.710
That's right.

05:27.770 --> 05:29.151
No benefits.

05:29.271 --> 05:31.413
Cheaper at the lower end of the scale.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.835
So, you know, a guy like me, I'm 50.

05:34.636 --> 05:36.297
Yeah, that's exactly what happened with you.

05:36.317 --> 05:37.338
I left this newspaper.

05:37.358 --> 05:38.379
I mean, I still write for them.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.640
Freelance now.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.162
I'm part-time.

05:41.762 --> 05:42.563
That's what they want.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.324
That's what they want.

05:43.384 --> 05:43.844
And they love it.

05:43.924 --> 05:46.366
And they love you because you're a professional and you know what you're doing.

05:46.426 --> 05:50.050
I've been doing it for 20 years, and now they're getting me for zilch.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.531
Yeah, that's what they want.

05:51.871 --> 05:52.772
See, the young guys,

05:53.123 --> 06:03.915
I'm sure they really want the older guys because they know what they're doing, but they want to show them who's boss, and they want to say, you know, take the other guys, you're welcome to come back, too, but of course, like Farhana was, you've done before.

06:04.556 --> 06:13.105
Yeah, and so eventually, I think that the papers, not the papers, I mean, the papers should do it, but the government's got to release these figures.

06:13.786 --> 06:18.912
When we see unemployment and employment rates, I'd like to not just see them say,

06:19.077 --> 06:23.402
I don't want to see that.

06:23.502 --> 06:25.385
I want to see it separated.

06:25.465 --> 06:28.708
I want to see full time with benefits list.

06:28.729 --> 06:31.091
I want to see hard time with no benefits list.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.254
I want to see small business and small funds.

06:33.474 --> 06:36.197
I want to see it all separate, like at least four columns.

06:36.838 --> 06:40.923
And you know how phony that figure is when they say the unemployment rate went down?

06:40.943 --> 06:41.524
Benefits.

06:41.604 --> 06:45.068
You see, I collected for a year.

06:45.284 --> 06:47.046
So you counted as one that was unapplied.

06:47.086 --> 06:52.832
Yeah, but when my benefits ran out, I don't count anymore.

06:53.272 --> 06:59.899
That's baloney, you see, because there are so many people whose benefits run out, and let me tell you, it's hard.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.902
It's hard to find work, but you don't count anything.

07:03.622 --> 07:06.986
I don't know if they count you as, now you're... They don't count me, period.

07:07.006 --> 07:08.187
You don't exist.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.429
I don't exist.

07:10.629 --> 07:11.190
Yeah.

07:11.542 --> 07:12.883
This is very upsetting.

07:13.144 --> 07:22.494
And I think, why aren't we all out there, like in Dr. Zhivago, with our picket sign, saying, whoa, we want something.

07:22.534 --> 07:24.235
We want to figure out what's going wrong.

07:24.255 --> 07:25.377
We want to get it straightened up.

07:25.657 --> 07:27.559
We don't want you to hear about new jobs.

07:27.579 --> 07:28.820
Jobs is not a good word.

07:29.281 --> 07:31.703
We don't want to hear about that.

07:31.723 --> 07:33.025
We want more.

07:33.245 --> 07:38.190
And if people aren't excited enough, it's sort of like the water has come to a boil too slowly.

07:38.828 --> 07:44.276
And then, I mean, are they afraid of tanks and helicopters?

07:44.296 --> 07:45.458
I mean, what are we afraid of?

07:45.478 --> 07:49.023
I mean, we all ought to at least be a little upset.

07:49.804 --> 07:52.348
Do you get angry when you're right?

07:52.368 --> 07:55.552
Yeah, especially when the helicopters were flying over my house while I was working.

07:55.572 --> 07:58.637
Helicopters were flying over my house looking for marijuana.

07:58.877 --> 08:01.040
In fact, they don't even have to find marijuana.

08:01.080 --> 08:06.388
Someone just reports that they thought you had marijuana and were selling it

08:07.010 --> 08:09.754
as far back as the 70s, they could take your house.

08:10.635 --> 08:11.316
They could take your house.

08:11.536 --> 08:31.363
And in Maine, that's been one of the things, is to take people's houses, get the kids away, because the state of Maine, when they're so poor, that's one thing, but this program, you know, when you take something away from people that they want badly and they're going to do it anyway, gambling, drinking, drugs, prostitution, these kind of things, they're going to do it anyway.

08:31.463 --> 08:35.228
It's just that they're going to create this huge underworld, this huge

08:35.714 --> 08:37.896
And this is what they've done.

08:37.916 --> 08:41.059
And the bureaucracy has to feed itself.

08:41.079 --> 08:47.945
So what are they going to do to get money into this drug program is to collect houses and have it go back into it.

08:47.965 --> 08:50.247
What do they do with the houses when they take them?

08:50.267 --> 08:50.847
They sell them.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.109
They sell them cheap so that they can get money.

08:53.469 --> 08:56.692
And I've got tons of articles on this, and I'm following very closely with some people.

08:57.313 --> 09:05.620
One guy and his wife, she's an attorney who's been following the cases very closely in Maine and the country.

09:05.819 --> 09:11.307
Whenever I've got a question about it, I write them, and they tell me who it's been serious.

09:11.787 --> 09:18.877
When I say you get angry, though, I mean just angry with the system when you're writing, and does this influence the text?

09:19.318 --> 09:19.538
Yeah.

09:19.558 --> 09:30.814
Well, like I said, the helicopters are over here, and you know that they are out there doing some very unjust, unfair, terrible, I mean, something that feels like our Constitution is like a

09:31.621 --> 09:33.043
Confederate dollar bill now.

09:33.163 --> 09:40.913
I mean, it's like our people are under such, we're just a joke to the government who's being lobbied by these businesses and all that.

09:41.554 --> 09:50.225
And I feel that, you know, as they're flying over me, I mean, while I'm writing, and all these things are happening, every time I pick up on this paper, where all this stuff happens, it goes inside you.

09:50.626 --> 09:57.595
When your characters come out, they're, and you see around you the way they're living their life, is being affected by this stuff.

09:58.655 --> 10:00.277
It's not even like a planet.

10:00.337 --> 10:01.960
It's not like an idea that I have.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.121
It's exactly what you say.

10:03.141 --> 10:03.742
It's anger.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.405
It's strong feelings that I have.

10:06.266 --> 10:10.312
That's where my characters come from, is my feelings, not from ideas at all.

10:10.652 --> 10:15.499
But how do you translate that into the creation of a character?

10:15.780 --> 10:18.844
It's a very nicely, fully rounded character.

10:19.746 --> 10:21.588
I am trying to get to the book, too.

10:21.608 --> 10:23.932
Yeah, it's sort of like the book is writing.

10:24.052 --> 10:25.634
Fiction is like juggling.

10:25.654 --> 10:27.717
You juggle all these things at one time.

10:28.102 --> 10:34.310
It is, like I said, it's not so much ideas, it is emotions.

10:34.330 --> 10:37.154
Matt read ones where you actually kind of get yourself into a trance.

10:37.515 --> 10:46.126
Yeah, I've talked to other fiction writers, too, and people who really write fiction, you know, not, well, literature, I guess, I mean, you know, not genres.

10:46.186 --> 10:48.870
I've been writing about writers for 20 years.

10:48.930 --> 10:56.320
Yeah, ask them about this trance thing, because once I started asking other people, they go, well, yeah, as a matter of fact, it's sort of something, one of them said,

10:56.755 --> 11:00.381
She said to me, Jose, I haven't admitted it to too many people because it sounded too strange.

11:00.401 --> 11:08.533
She said, but I heard, um, God, Gardner, John, Gardner, does his name, John?

11:08.553 --> 11:09.234
Something Gardner.

11:09.355 --> 11:10.797
It wasn't John Gardner, he died.

11:10.817 --> 11:11.638
Was he in Florida?

11:12.460 --> 11:13.882
He used to teach, he died, yeah.

11:13.902 --> 11:15.985
He died in a motorcycle or something.

11:16.005 --> 11:17.247
Oh, really?

11:17.267 --> 11:19.911
John Gardner, he used to, and he wrote books about fiction.

11:20.192 --> 11:22.014
Yeah, he taught, yeah.

11:22.034 --> 11:22.375
He did, right.

11:22.658 --> 11:25.060
He said, she said, he's the only other person I heard.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.443
So we started asking different ones.

11:28.884 --> 11:30.005
Tell me, describe it.

11:30.025 --> 11:36.590
I mean, do you actually use... Well, you have to make the whole world disappear in order for the characters to come alive.

11:36.851 --> 11:38.472
Otherwise, they'd be too frail.

11:38.512 --> 11:42.035
They wouldn't even be able to get a grasp on them.

11:42.055 --> 11:43.496
So, to make the whole world disappear.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.759
I guess what... You mean the real world?

11:46.199 --> 11:47.560
Because it's very vigorous.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.682
The real world is very vigorous.

11:49.702 --> 11:50.843
Real people are very vigorous.

11:51.228 --> 12:01.218
You can't have any interruption.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.684
It's not like a trance, like you'd go to sleep, obviously, and you wouldn't be writing.

12:07.724 --> 12:19.395
It's more like, I'd say, the most painful, actually, the most muscular kind of concentration.

12:19.831 --> 12:31.189
This is one of the reasons why you kind of put it off in the beginning, when you start a work, is because it is such a strain to concentrate that hard.

12:32.612 --> 12:43.910
Maybe more than a trance, it is a kind of concentration with no other kind of concentration.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.573
But maybe it's a trance.

12:45.613 --> 12:46.294
Do you outline?

12:47.337 --> 12:56.728
And I read also where you perhaps distill one page from a hundred pages.

12:56.748 --> 12:57.469
Yeah, kind of.

12:57.489 --> 13:01.374
Well, I outline, but then, you know, change it.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.137
Keep changing as it goes along, because it doesn't look like we're really going there.

13:04.197 --> 13:07.181
And of course, the characters have to lead the way.

13:07.201 --> 13:09.543
You can't make them do each one.

13:09.563 --> 13:12.607
So I can't do any outlines.

13:12.627 --> 13:16.011
Just constant outlines, but something so I can feel.

13:17.003 --> 13:19.086
I'm like, I'm not really lost.

13:19.106 --> 13:20.168
I don't want to feel too lost.

13:20.428 --> 13:24.134
You mentioned that final scene at the end.

13:24.154 --> 13:27.399
Did you know as you were writing that you were heading for this?

13:27.419 --> 13:29.142
For this future, the future scene.

13:29.162 --> 13:31.526
I was thinking more of where he dreams of the future.

13:32.147 --> 13:42.483
I guess because I have had this dream of the future myself, and that was one of the things that had led me into the work, or that I did have this dream of the future.

13:42.503 --> 13:43.264
Tell me a little bit about that.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.974
I've had a few dreams about the future.

13:45.994 --> 13:54.327
I have one dream where, you know, most of the, well, I do dream in colors and people, you know, friends and family or whatever.

13:54.367 --> 14:00.837
People, I don't know what it is about my dreams where there's always like a hundred people and they're all running around and stuff.

14:00.857 --> 14:04.884
But nowadays, these little black and white dreams are very disturbing to me.

14:04.904 --> 14:07.308
They're kind of like TV.

14:07.328 --> 14:10.112
And I see my white eyes and I just can't.

14:10.598 --> 14:23.215
This particular one was that we were all being loaded into trucks, and it was, I don't know if it was cooler weather, because we were all wearing heavy coats and so forth, and it was black and white.

14:23.235 --> 14:27.260
And we were all, it was a grave situation, a very grave situation.

14:27.521 --> 14:32.527
We got on the trucks, and over the top was this, like, sign as the truck ran to pull away.

14:32.547 --> 14:33.549
It said, Tuoto.

14:34.189 --> 14:39.897
And I always said to my husband, this was like 10 years ago, I said, well, if it comes through, we will...

14:40.130 --> 14:41.872
probably riding up Route 202.

14:42.693 --> 14:45.738
And because there's a Route 202 there, the house we lived in.

14:46.298 --> 14:51.646
And then I said to Michael Haldegas, you know, I don't know, maybe it's the year 2002.

14:51.666 --> 14:57.453
I'm going to get really scared because some of these other dreams I've had like that came absolutely true.

14:57.513 --> 14:57.914
It's a dream.

14:57.934 --> 14:59.216
I was at Vermont College.

14:59.336 --> 15:00.758
I didn't know I was at Vermont College.

15:01.058 --> 15:02.220
It was a dream just like that.

15:02.720 --> 15:07.006
I dreamed I was sitting in this room, and it was before my book was published.

15:07.026 --> 15:08.769
I had no idea this would ever happen.

15:08.789 --> 15:09.850
It was a dream.

15:10.049 --> 15:22.819
I was sitting in a chair, and there was a big window, and I could see people walking across the snow, dozens of them, and they came around to a door and came into the door and gave me gifts.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.743
They were all bringing me gifts.

15:24.763 --> 15:26.667
And I said, Michael, that was a nice one.

15:26.728 --> 15:28.632
I was happy.

15:29.101 --> 15:44.617
About a year and a half, two years later, I was sitting in this chair of Mark College, and I could look out across the courtyard, and the people came around, they came down the hallway, came to the door, and one of them brought me a clock, one of them brought me a little scarf, one of them brought me a little package of poems she'd written.

15:44.637 --> 15:45.798
And it was just like that to me.

15:45.818 --> 15:52.184
I said, look, I said, well, the only one that hasn't, and there were some others, too, but the only one that hadn't come through yet was the two or two ones.

15:52.204 --> 15:54.366
And so, I mean, this sounds all silly and everything.

15:54.707 --> 15:59.091
I don't usually tell to many people, but this disturbed me so much that

15:59.645 --> 16:00.626
It disturbed you?

16:00.706 --> 16:10.618
This other one about the 202 thing, that every time I'd set to work, it would keep resurfacing with the other stuff that I was working on.

16:11.039 --> 16:15.484
So I began to see that I was working towards this in the work as well.

16:16.025 --> 16:18.368
Not intentionally, but it just kept kind of coming out.

16:19.069 --> 16:19.870
It was a concern.

16:20.030 --> 16:21.872
It was a concern.

16:22.342 --> 16:24.725
Do you plan on doing a book this year?

16:24.765 --> 16:24.965
No.

16:25.286 --> 16:25.666
No way.

16:26.107 --> 16:27.328
I want to go small.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.470
I want to go small.

16:28.510 --> 16:31.013
Because the first two books were tight.

16:31.033 --> 16:31.874
They were a lot tighter.

16:31.894 --> 16:33.856
And I'm not complaining.

16:34.237 --> 16:37.380
But it really is a rich tapestry here.

16:37.861 --> 16:45.270
Well, financially, for publishers, they probably like it a lot better if it's smaller, because you see it's the same price as a smaller one.

16:45.550 --> 16:46.712
So I really would try for small.

16:46.752 --> 16:51.758
But what happened was I know when I did beans, I was not confident.

16:52.514 --> 16:57.741
I was not sure myself about how well I could hold a reader's attention.

16:57.761 --> 17:02.467
So I didn't allow myself to cut loose with character development.

17:02.487 --> 17:05.972
And then by the second time I let go a little more and I worked at material.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.954
I had a better idea what bad was anyway.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.136
I knew the first one was bad.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.037
I didn't want to do it like that.

17:10.758 --> 17:12.100
What do you mean the first one?

17:12.120 --> 17:13.421
The first one was wonderful.

17:13.642 --> 17:17.086
Not well written.

17:17.106 --> 17:17.507
It was awful.

17:17.567 --> 17:20.470
But the second one, I felt the second one was better written.

17:21.312 --> 17:22.453
But this time...

17:22.788 --> 17:33.588
You know, like a photographer puts the paper and the film, different, whatever, that paper, I guess I'm thinking, into the sensitized paper.

17:33.608 --> 17:34.089
The tree.

17:34.109 --> 17:40.040
Yeah, into the tree, into the chemicals, and slowly, you know, kind of, that's the way the novels do.

17:40.441 --> 17:43.346
But this one seemed to be... You mean this new one?

17:43.366 --> 17:46.011
Yeah, it seemed to be like, instead of a...

17:46.835 --> 17:51.420
you know, a 5 by 7, it seemed to be getting to be an 11 by 14.

17:51.761 --> 17:54.584
And I kept thinking, well, something's wrong here.

17:54.604 --> 17:56.026
I mean, it seemed to be too much stuff.

17:56.046 --> 17:57.548
There were too many people, there was too much stuff.

17:57.568 --> 17:59.630
I don't know what's going on.

17:59.991 --> 18:13.787
I thought what was happening was that I, because I pictured a smaller book, I thought that I was out of focus somehow, and that it wasn't, I didn't know where I was going.

18:14.290 --> 18:17.614
But then it began to get clearer and clearer, thicker.

18:17.634 --> 18:21.199
It was tied together better so I could see that it was just a bigger bore.

18:21.540 --> 18:24.484
Did you work at all with your editor while this was going well?

18:24.564 --> 18:24.864
No.

18:24.884 --> 18:26.887
Or did he just want to see the work when it was done?

18:26.907 --> 18:29.310
Yeah, I don't like to shoot.

18:29.330 --> 18:31.032
I don't like him to see it until it's done.

18:31.093 --> 18:37.261
At this time, he did see a little piece at the end before it was done, and I told him I didn't want to do it.

18:37.281 --> 18:38.162
You wanted to see it.

18:38.182 --> 18:41.887
Yeah, I'm a year and a half of a deadline, and I was a little worried about that.

18:41.947 --> 18:43.369
But I don't really...

18:43.602 --> 18:46.546
I like to have the time where I need to get it presentable.

18:46.586 --> 18:49.310
You know, it's like going outside with no clothes on.

18:49.330 --> 18:51.212
To the public, I mean, you kind of want to get dressed first.

18:51.793 --> 18:53.976
And that was the way it felt, you know, about the work.

18:54.056 --> 18:56.099
I want it to be presentable.

18:56.119 --> 19:05.031
I don't like... I think, too, if you're at a procedure work in progress, when they do see it finished finally, they're still going to remember it once more.

19:05.051 --> 19:07.074
Like you remember your kid as a baby.

19:07.575 --> 19:09.417
They never can be anything but a baby together.

19:09.758 --> 19:10.399
They're always a baby.

19:10.419 --> 19:12.141
You always expect them to do baby things.

19:12.644 --> 19:14.166
I think that's why kids hate their parents.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.448
It's like telling the jury to forget something they just heard.

19:16.508 --> 19:17.429
Yeah.

19:17.529 --> 19:17.989
Yes.

19:18.370 --> 19:18.890
Exactly.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.553
Forget your sort of compassion.

19:21.573 --> 19:21.913
Yeah.

19:21.933 --> 19:24.276
The jury will disregard what they just heard.

19:24.556 --> 19:24.916
Yeah.

19:24.936 --> 19:25.136
Yeah.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.478
Exactly.

19:26.518 --> 19:27.659
Yes, you're right.

19:27.739 --> 19:28.820
It's ridiculous.

19:28.840 --> 19:36.868
Now, when Corksmith finally, because I'd like to get his name in the following, because I understand he's a wonderful, and you pay a nice tribute to him.

19:37.829 --> 19:41.633
What did he bring to the book, Pennsylvania?

19:41.673 --> 19:41.773
Okay.

19:42.614 --> 19:50.062
When I had my first book written, like I said, I don't feel as... I mean, it wasn't worse.

19:50.262 --> 19:50.923
I mean, horrible.

19:50.943 --> 19:51.824
It wasn't a horrible book.

19:51.844 --> 19:55.608
I think it showed a person who might be able to write a book later.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.110
But it wasn't.

19:57.130 --> 20:01.355
But he's the kind of editor who doesn't say, rewrite, rewrite.

20:01.455 --> 20:04.318
All he does is he says, he's not a writer.

20:04.338 --> 20:05.039
He's a reader.

20:05.359 --> 20:06.400
He's always loved books.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.103
And he says, I am your first reader.

20:09.123 --> 20:12.167
And what he does is he sits with you and he has all these questions he asks me.

20:12.187 --> 20:12.587
He says,

20:13.073 --> 20:16.197
Did you really mean this?

20:16.217 --> 20:17.098
What did you mean by that?

20:18.039 --> 20:19.761
Is this your intent?

20:20.261 --> 20:22.384
And so it caused you to really think about your work.

20:22.604 --> 20:36.060
And so he really, by not jumping on me and forcing himself into the work, I feel allowed me to take so much risk the next time and then the next time.

20:36.860 --> 20:41.646
So much risk to really push, to really feel confidence about myself because I felt like I was in charge.

20:42.132 --> 20:44.255
I didn't have to worry what he was going to do.

20:44.416 --> 20:50.506
I mean, I did worry that he and people would like it, but I didn't worry that he was going to come in there and grab it and do something.

20:50.526 --> 20:52.449
Well, that's the first book you did with him, is this right?

20:52.469 --> 20:53.390
All the three, yeah.

20:53.410 --> 20:56.315
Oh, well, no, he was with Tickering Fields, and then he went to Harcourt, right?

20:56.335 --> 20:57.517
Yeah, so I went with him there.

20:57.537 --> 20:58.178
Oh, so you went with him.

20:58.439 --> 20:58.759
Yeah.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.442
Now, where's he going now, I wonder?

21:01.263 --> 21:04.208
Well, being a professional, professional,

21:04.627 --> 21:08.236
You know what I mean?

21:08.416 --> 21:10.261
They want the young ones, I think.

21:10.281 --> 21:11.985
I mean, this is what I perceive.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.110
And I'm not blaming any one company.

21:14.230 --> 21:17.759
I think it's the system, the way that the investors are.

21:17.980 --> 21:22.230
I've got a book out there right now.

21:22.463 --> 21:23.784
I know the situation.

21:23.844 --> 21:31.111
They're cutting back, and it's a good book about books, and everybody who looks at this is wonderful, but they're looking for the bucks.

21:31.171 --> 21:31.892
What's it going to do?

21:32.832 --> 21:34.894
Who's going to buy it?

21:35.535 --> 21:39.298
So believe me, I... And can it be made cheap, and can they pay you cheap?

21:39.358 --> 21:41.761
You know, they want to pay you as little as possible.

21:41.961 --> 21:45.564
This is the story of my life.

21:45.584 --> 21:47.045
Yeah, we're in it together.

21:47.145 --> 21:49.027
We're all in it together, right?

21:50.589 --> 21:52.150
The Robin Hood theme.

21:53.665 --> 21:56.889
You know, you started with this dream that you had.

21:56.909 --> 21:57.129
Yeah.

21:57.430 --> 22:01.355
When did this theme of the Robert Tremblay work in?

22:01.375 --> 22:09.324
I guess the people, when they see and feel this stuff coming on, when our lives are affected this way, many of us do want to fight back.

22:09.945 --> 22:12.128
Many of us want to do something to change it.

22:13.069 --> 22:22.761
And I guess what it felt like as I began to have these heroes, I had a couple of people in there who were the type who would take on, was to show that in the 1990s,

22:23.922 --> 22:24.943
You can't.

22:25.504 --> 22:31.710
I mean, you know, he couldn't do anything, and he was real shy anyway, but then the other one, Annika, couldn't do anything.

22:31.731 --> 22:33.352
I mean, you can't fight it.

22:34.634 --> 22:37.577
You know, even when you get a few people together, you can't.

22:37.597 --> 22:40.100
So this is not only anger, but it's frustration.

22:41.341 --> 22:41.902
Is it defeat?

22:41.922 --> 22:43.363
Does it approach your sense of defeat?

22:44.364 --> 22:47.988
I think, as human beings, we don't, or we just start breathing now.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.191
So we're never totally defeated.

22:50.211 --> 22:52.393
We fight to the end.

22:52.880 --> 23:07.474
And I find that I've made a new friend, and her name is Helen Pergian, and she has written a book called Fed Man, New York, and she's going around the country trying to stop the death penalty in the United States.

23:07.494 --> 23:08.455
And she's so hopeful.

23:08.575 --> 23:09.035
I'm not.

23:09.336 --> 23:21.047
You know, I say to her, I think that they'll, you know, two years ago, they introduced 50 new ways for the death penalty and tried to get it so that it would be required in every state.

23:21.500 --> 23:27.809
And I said, you know, I noticed that it was, one of them was if you had an illegal drug and a firearm on you at the same time.

23:27.829 --> 23:32.375
If you had a hunting rifle and a marijuana, whatever, you would be given the chance.

23:32.836 --> 23:34.799
And I wrote my senator about it, and it was true.

23:34.939 --> 23:36.381
It wasn't like it was a misprint in the paper.

23:36.862 --> 23:42.249
And when I mentioned to her, she goes, yeah, what about the one working, doing some kind of a thing in the poultry business?

23:42.610 --> 23:45.835
I said, well, maybe that was what they call, what is that word?

23:46.215 --> 23:51.102
When they add stupid things to it to try to get it to fail or whatever, that could have been it.

23:51.368 --> 24:01.560
But I feel that they, boy, there's a lot of people in the United States they'd like to get rid of, and of course the poor, and if they can make the chair or whatever, you know.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.261
Easy to use.

24:02.281 --> 24:14.235
Easy to use, and if they make a lot of laws to get rid of this drug group that they're disproven of and all this stuff, people in the streets with the guns and the, you know, there's a whole bunch of them that are a real problem right now.

24:15.056 --> 24:16.718
I'm worried.

24:17.103 --> 24:21.029
No, she says, I think we can stop it because people are basically good.

24:21.049 --> 24:22.331
Yeah, she's a nun.

24:22.772 --> 24:24.394
People are basically good.

24:24.815 --> 24:29.802
And I keep thinking, boy, I think what it is is when someone fights as hard as she does, she's got to have a vision of hope.

24:30.423 --> 24:30.984
She's got to do it.

24:31.004 --> 24:31.765
Why bother?

24:32.226 --> 24:35.110
So I think there's so many people who don't feel defeated.

24:35.731 --> 24:36.973
They keep going.

24:38.435 --> 24:45.726
And I've suggested, why don't we get it so that Thomas Jefferson said that the small landowner is the most

24:47.090 --> 24:56.199
important part of a nation that we, you know, it's very important to keep people feeding themselves, taking care of themselves, being part of a little community.

24:56.219 --> 24:59.803
That kind of poor is one thing.

25:00.183 --> 25:09.533
Living homeless, landless in the streets with no skills to take care of yourself, guns and drugs and all that stuff, is a survival skill.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.535
I mean, human beings are beautiful animals.

25:11.555 --> 25:12.816
I mean, they're going to figure out something.

25:14.218 --> 25:14.818
And that's it.

25:15.079 --> 25:16.320
That's how they figure to keep

25:16.773 --> 25:17.534
alive.

25:18.975 --> 25:25.401
And so it's like, well, if you give them this, you know, and then every time I say this, someone goes, well, I lived on a farm and I left.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.903
I go, yeah, and you were going to death now.

25:26.923 --> 25:27.423
You're happy.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.364
This is what you wanted.

25:28.945 --> 25:33.169
What about all these, for instance, say, in New England and out around who still want their farms?

25:33.229 --> 25:34.590
No one's hoping to keep them.

25:35.951 --> 25:42.197
And all these people who are in revolt right now.

25:42.217 --> 25:43.118
So I'm thinking, you know,

25:45.173 --> 25:57.330
You know, it's like education, that's the thing that gives me hope is if we could have education, say, you know, 100% of the people, children, are forced to go to school.

25:57.410 --> 25:58.352
Because they have that.

25:58.732 --> 25:59.694
They still drop off.

25:59.714 --> 26:02.037
They still don't call them.

26:02.057 --> 26:02.257
Right.

26:02.898 --> 26:05.081
There are laws that say every kid has to go to school.

26:05.101 --> 26:05.742
To learn the desk.

26:06.123 --> 26:07.004
To learn the desk.

26:07.024 --> 26:07.184
Yeah.

26:07.344 --> 26:07.505
Right.

26:07.585 --> 26:09.848
And to learn white, and to aspire to the white shirt.

26:10.216 --> 26:14.102
Obviously, the ones that are dropping out are saying, I wasn't meant to be a white.

26:14.162 --> 26:21.453
I mean, why would anybody think that 100% of the people are meant to be great at the desk, to be a lawyer, a doctor, or a business person?

26:21.473 --> 26:23.896
What's ever made us think that 100% of the people is anyone?

26:24.397 --> 26:25.799
Sure.

26:25.819 --> 26:31.628
Well, I went to school up there, and I went to Bates in 1965, or a few years ago.

26:31.648 --> 26:39.700
But I remember even then, the concern was, were these kids getting educated about main kids going to college, and they do well?

26:39.899 --> 26:46.005
I remember they were so fearful that, well, fine, they're getting trained, and they're getting educated, and they're acquiring skills.

26:46.025 --> 26:47.326
Now they're going to leave the state of Maine.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.768
Yeah, and then break the family up.

26:49.808 --> 26:56.215
Yeah, but it didn't just break the family up, but you're getting these highly skilled people, and now they're going off to the big city.

26:56.295 --> 26:58.156
They're going off to Katy Perry, you know?

26:58.397 --> 26:59.478
Yeah, it's terrible.

26:59.498 --> 27:00.659
It is terrible in a sense.

27:00.679 --> 27:02.340
I mean, if that's their choice, fine.

27:02.781 --> 27:05.784
But what about this, you know, if you take 100% of the kids?

27:06.384 --> 27:09.147
I mean, I'm very close to people who don't read and write.

27:09.532 --> 27:10.733
They're not meant to read and write.

27:10.853 --> 27:12.175
The words shift around.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.257
I mean, they were meant to farm, to fish, to hunt.

27:14.778 --> 27:20.724
And they are told that, well, we're going to do special ed, and they just will not give up on it.

27:20.764 --> 27:24.768
I guess this is thousands of years we could farm, fish, and hunt.

27:24.788 --> 27:26.130
We could survive as people.

27:27.051 --> 27:30.995
Now, in like a couple of generations, nobody knows.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.056
Nobody knows.

27:32.236 --> 27:34.258
Almost nobody knows how to do this.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.860
If this big mother

27:36.245 --> 27:46.415
this big corporate mother of ours, which we're all sucking off of, dies or abandons us, which it is doing slowly, pulling out, we're going to be able to survive.

27:46.615 --> 27:48.456
We're all going to be in the streets with the guns and the trucks.

27:48.537 --> 27:58.746
I mean, like I say, all right, guys, this is an unpleasant thought to a lot of you that maybe we should try seeing to it that some people might not be made for the desk.

27:58.766 --> 28:00.228
They don't want to give up on that idea.

28:00.608 --> 28:03.190
But what is going to happen if we keep going the way we're going now?

28:03.551 --> 28:04.952
We're going to have these messes.

28:05.337 --> 28:20.373
masses of people that are displaced, or masses of people that are dependent on this big system in some way, like the high-tech stuff, and all this stuff, and working at Walmart's, and all this stuff.

28:20.393 --> 28:21.815
Masses of people that can't eat.

28:21.835 --> 28:27.581
When that pulls out, how are we going to feed ourselves?

28:27.641 --> 28:28.682
This is the book.

28:28.902 --> 28:34.348
I mean, this is what I would... I did feel very urgent about getting this book out.

28:34.868 --> 28:36.430
I was a year and a half past that line.

28:36.470 --> 28:37.331
That wasn't just it.

28:37.411 --> 28:40.214
I did feel I really wanted to talk to people about this.

28:40.895 --> 28:47.001
And now maybe part of the urgency was somewhere in there.

28:47.022 --> 28:51.246
I knew that we were going to lose our publisher.

28:51.266 --> 28:55.451
If I hadn't gotten it done then, another week, another month, it would have been over.

28:55.471 --> 28:56.152
No, it wasn't that.

28:56.252 --> 28:59.515
It was this stuff I see.

28:59.535 --> 29:00.977
It's a big picture.

29:01.210 --> 29:03.953
Clinton and these guys, they go, jobs, we need jobs.

29:04.133 --> 29:07.497
Yeah, more McDonald's jobs, more time, no benefits.

29:07.918 --> 29:09.039
Jobs is not how it works.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.741
Yeah, yeah.

29:10.981 --> 29:12.583
We need more small business.

29:12.603 --> 29:14.866
We need more, not less.

29:14.886 --> 29:18.490
We need to simplify the burdens that are on small business.

29:18.770 --> 29:20.092
We need to let up.

29:20.272 --> 29:23.696
And then they always go, if you let a farmer sell milk, it'll get us all sick.

29:24.037 --> 29:28.262
All right, if we don't do something now, we're going to be worse than sick.

29:28.282 --> 29:29.423
Why do they always have the milk?

29:29.463 --> 29:30.424
They always jump on the milk.

29:31.315 --> 29:43.549
Right now, in our state, the law bank has just said, well, we can't afford, all right, the governor was on the TV the other night talking grip service about the small farm in his home.

29:43.569 --> 29:52.539
At the very same time, the state dumped eight potato inspectors.

29:52.559 --> 29:55.402
The potato inspectors have to inspect the potatoes before they can be back.

29:56.023 --> 30:00.748
The little farmers sometimes have to wait for days to get a potato inspect.

30:01.403 --> 30:11.418
The big potato, the big farms, big giant agribusinesses get an office where the potato inspects the babies.

30:11.438 --> 30:13.862
So is that giving small businesses a break?

30:14.402 --> 30:18.929
I think they should be seen first and let them let them know.

30:19.330 --> 30:20.872
What's the reaction to you now in Maine?

30:20.892 --> 30:26.841
I mean, it was kind of mixed there in the beginning.

30:26.861 --> 30:28.043
I mean, the people in Maine.

30:28.063 --> 30:29.605
I mean, there were some people in some areas who said, you know,

30:30.563 --> 30:38.374
Yeah, George Mitchell didn't want me to tell him.

30:38.394 --> 30:38.775
Is that right?

30:38.955 --> 30:40.658
He said, what do they think of us?

30:40.738 --> 30:45.244
He wanted everybody to think that we were all like him and George Bush.

30:47.387 --> 30:51.954
And the yellow-ringed coat guy with a little smile on the pipe.

30:52.034 --> 30:58.984
But besides him, there were a lot of people who were very close to having any income, at the time, having no income.

30:59.386 --> 31:05.219
who kind of, I think they were afraid that people would say well like that, because they were so close, you know what I mean?

31:05.519 --> 31:14.880
Because there were a lot of kind of richish people and middle-class professional people who would come to my readings, but it didn't worry them any, but it was the ones who were very close.
