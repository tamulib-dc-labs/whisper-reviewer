WEBVTT

00:15.083 --> 00:36.729
I dropped this this morning, you see?

00:36.749 --> 00:38.612
I, uh, I'm just gonna buy more tape, that's a... there's a campus bootstrap next door, right?

00:38.632 --> 00:38.712
Yes.

00:38.732 --> 00:43.858
I'm sorry, I didn't let you... Oh, you're almost ready.

00:44.328 --> 01:04.488
So this is the... The Stingford Box 1.

01:04.949 --> 01:11.495
And this is a very detailed book that we already know.

01:11.515 --> 01:14.098
We're actually nearly this detailed book that is about our university.

01:14.635 --> 01:17.519
we had something to do with it.

01:17.539 --> 01:34.504
So this not only tells you this is box one folder on the base, but it also gives you a kind of a description of what's in there, some quotes, um, and some subject terms.

01:34.524 --> 01:42.516
But you can also by clicking on this actually see the

01:43.745 --> 01:46.247
Physically in box 1.

01:47.588 --> 01:50.591
And you can see them in thumbnails.

01:50.611 --> 02:01.860
If you click on one, it can actually get the textbooks more than readable.

02:02.561 --> 02:10.107
Oh, look at that.

02:10.127 --> 02:10.407
Yep.

02:10.587 --> 02:13.650
And this is 1828, so it is time that you engage to look for a new movie to arrive.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.222
And they're now one girl.

02:16.242 --> 02:20.046
I want some help very much to help them.

02:20.466 --> 02:21.968
Wish you to have you come immediately.

02:23.509 --> 02:26.192
It is not a regular tradition.

02:26.212 --> 02:26.352
No.

02:26.372 --> 02:32.438
But, uh, well, the money is why I work at work right now.

02:33.018 --> 02:36.822
So this is actually for someone who is just in research.

02:37.182 --> 02:40.005
In some way, of course, this is like this world.

02:41.987 --> 02:42.507
But...

02:43.533 --> 02:53.826
It's actually a fine combination in terms of that.

02:53.846 --> 03:08.904
You can then also do this Esprit.

03:08.924 --> 03:11.768
So you can really pretty much scan through that.

03:18.886 --> 03:47.863
So in any event, that's...

03:48.400 --> 03:55.671
That's one of the things that this door links you from the Exhibit to the actual guide.

03:55.811 --> 04:04.024
Now there's a way of getting to this guide from... Eventually there will be from the Online Catalog as well.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.147
So that'll be for me.

04:06.668 --> 04:12.837
You should be able to click on a button on the Online Catalog and get to the guide or to the Exhibit.

04:13.859 --> 04:17.344
Now I'm sure you really know that well with it.

04:17.645 --> 04:27.682
Right, and we've been very, you know, rather planning on scanning books.

04:28.763 --> 04:34.793
And this is still pretty much experimental one, because it's very experimental.

04:34.814 --> 04:40.323
Unlike books, each one is a little bit different, so you have to see where they are.

04:40.343 --> 04:43.568
There's a lot more upward involved.

04:43.733 --> 04:49.660
Each letter, you have the equipment here.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.482
Oh, yeah.

04:51.502 --> 04:54.566
We no longer stand up here as a production.

04:54.706 --> 05:07.521
That doesn't seem to be a perfect one for a long days to do.

05:07.541 --> 05:13.048
But now it's about a lot.

05:15.290 --> 05:20.256
to make the decision on which materials to brew style?

05:20.636 --> 05:25.502
You said when you brew this, the light was wrong, but anyway, that was very serious.

05:25.562 --> 05:29.867
So how great time do you apply to that?

05:29.887 --> 05:33.471
This is really the only collection that does for it.

05:33.651 --> 05:42.681
We would do a little bit as of use, and that's really very tricky because the fashion of war, this will be the fashion of war next year.

05:43.589 --> 05:50.359
But in terms of what we see they're doing, they're in a perfect world, they'd scan everything.

05:50.379 --> 05:54.225
They'd scan everything, exactly.

05:55.847 --> 06:00.955
Perfect for all 70 nodes, and that is for us to probably do that.

06:01.556 --> 06:11.571
And they know that we have perhaps a modern administrative program that's a real leader.

06:11.905 --> 06:16.090
So I imagine that this pipe is pretty easy to decide when you're trying to do it.

06:16.110 --> 06:16.210
Yeah.

06:16.330 --> 06:16.971
It's hard.

06:17.271 --> 06:18.953
But shall you do?

06:18.973 --> 06:21.697
You don't have to be a genius to decide.

06:22.017 --> 06:24.000
Oh, right.

06:24.020 --> 06:26.843
I think you're awkward.

06:26.883 --> 06:29.306
Don't have it all for me.

06:29.326 --> 06:30.808
I would love all that.

06:30.968 --> 06:38.537
This one is kind of an interesting one, because you were saying that it is terrible.

06:39.378 --> 06:41.541
It was two parts.

06:41.561 --> 06:46.428
At first, the part had no physical.

06:46.448 --> 07:03.853
It's an expeditionary of an expeditionary of 1899 by Los Angeles.

07:03.874 --> 07:06.297
And what we did was misconstruy.

07:07.222 --> 07:36.418
When I was in the room, the X-Cords had X-Cords for what is what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for what we didn't transcribe, and that's the best X-Cords for

07:36.770 --> 07:38.652
Very, very horrible.

07:38.712 --> 07:43.096
And she told me if it's cured even, so I'd always believe that.

07:43.256 --> 07:48.001
Absolutely, it's the same thing, that same thing she don't care.

07:48.021 --> 07:48.502
I'm an expedition.

07:48.742 --> 07:50.464
So I go to Harrowwood.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.966
And then you go to Harrowwood.

07:53.467 --> 07:57.691
And then you go to Harrowwood.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.512
And then you go to Harrowwood.

07:58.532 --> 08:02.696
And then you go to Harrowwood.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.717
And then you go to Harrowwood.

08:03.737 --> 08:04.678
And then you go to Harrowwood.

08:04.698 --> 08:06.760
And then you go to Harrowwood.

08:06.959 --> 08:16.833
I think that was small if I used to like... You can play to that.

08:16.853 --> 08:19.056
I probably would like to play this a little more.

08:19.076 --> 08:21.119
Oh, yeah.

08:21.139 --> 08:25.385
A lot of the stuff that we're getting on the birds, I can get the swirlings and others.

08:25.906 --> 08:30.252
Now, I guess the project that you... Well, this is the game of 93.

08:30.392 --> 08:32.214
This one has actually done birds.

08:33.276 --> 08:33.797
Really?

08:33.817 --> 08:34.097
Yeah.

08:34.117 --> 08:36.240
The students are more categorized.

08:36.423 --> 08:48.360
Well, this is an exhibition.

08:48.961 --> 08:58.654
This is a project.

08:59.035 --> 09:01.959
This is a project.

09:03.361 --> 09:04.202
Generate.

09:04.402 --> 09:08.405
We're thinking of a form of existing girls, right?

09:08.425 --> 09:11.288
That's exactly nothing special.

09:12.409 --> 09:33.767
And part of the year, there wasn't a... But part of the year, the rest of the year, part of the year we tried this is... It was a manageable amount of this very small draw.

09:34.304 --> 09:59.400
Now how about the bread songs and stuff like that, would you get back?

10:00.106 --> 10:24.898
So what I'm driving at is that you were able to create something that is equal to our materials themselves by the fact that you were able to create something

10:25.216 --> 10:50.295
This is brand new, so it's not Brexley.

10:51.423 --> 11:01.796
This is going to be... Okay.

11:01.856 --> 11:20.940
This is a data witness that's sitting behind the site.

11:22.304 --> 11:27.531
Allow you to search for any image by this particular artist.

11:27.551 --> 11:30.715
There is anywhere on campus.

11:30.735 --> 11:33.178
So we have pictures.

11:33.198 --> 11:36.743
The laboratory by Halloween.

11:36.763 --> 11:45.214
We have pictures.

11:45.234 --> 11:48.058
Search for everything at the laboratory by Halloween.

11:51.447 --> 11:55.871
That would perhaps be a very good instance of engineering.

11:55.891 --> 11:59.414
As I said, it will be absolutely a little bit.

11:59.434 --> 12:09.103
I'll have to click a little point before I go.

12:09.124 --> 12:16.911
Okay, so it will tell you that there are 174 images in this data that are not going to play in the library, but it doesn't belong to the library.

12:16.991 --> 12:20.374
And these are actually a little bit of a computer.

12:21.400 --> 12:47.728
Oh, in the general, these are from the wall, these are from the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall

12:50.813 --> 13:08.198
If you wanted to see detail, we could get the drill.

13:08.566 --> 13:13.694
We don't want people thinking it's going to do so, right?

13:13.774 --> 13:19.282
Is any copyright question around both sides of the nation?

13:19.342 --> 13:28.035
Because we both are users of material and are in a very interesting situation.

13:28.295 --> 13:32.061
So I'm curious about the sophistication of some of the things that you showed me.

13:32.141 --> 13:36.227
I spoke of those Corvus and, you know, this is...

13:36.713 --> 13:42.802
You're doing great, sophisticated work here.

13:43.283 --> 13:51.455
Have you been in contact with them?

13:51.796 --> 13:55.361
Oh, I don't know.

13:55.381 --> 13:59.126
They've actually really used the images from the internet and stuff.

13:59.146 --> 13:59.747
They did something up to them.

13:59.767 --> 14:00.649
So we've got some interesting questions.

14:00.669 --> 14:04.134
If that was the first time, we've married and coached four nights outside the room for the rest of the rest of the time to watch.

14:04.154 --> 14:05.556
We've got different things from what you have to do.

14:05.975 --> 14:10.761
So I think I'm happy to be able to resolve it.

14:10.781 --> 14:12.423
Yeah, I think.

14:12.443 --> 14:16.028
Do you see where there's competition at all?

14:16.048 --> 14:17.450
I think I heard a lot of things.

14:17.710 --> 14:21.875
Do you have seven questions about what they're doing?

14:21.895 --> 14:22.116
Of course.

14:22.136 --> 14:23.918
I don't know who I am.

14:23.938 --> 14:26.321
I don't know who I am.

14:26.461 --> 14:28.404
I don't know who I am.

14:28.484 --> 14:29.585
I don't know who I am.

14:29.665 --> 14:30.727
I don't know who I am.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.648
I don't know who I am.

14:31.668 --> 14:33.050
I don't know who I am.

14:33.070 --> 14:33.570
I don't know who I am.

14:33.590 --> 14:34.031
I don't know who I am.

14:34.051 --> 14:34.491
I don't know who I am.

14:34.511 --> 14:34.952
I don't know who I am.

14:35.236 --> 14:38.981
And he's totally rethinking, uh, doing stuff like that.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.222
You're the man-based.

14:40.242 --> 14:40.963
You're the man-based.

14:41.124 --> 14:42.766
You're the man-based.

14:42.786 --> 14:43.607
You're the man-based.

14:43.627 --> 14:44.488
You're the man-based.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.429
You're the man-based.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.330
You're the man-based.

14:46.350 --> 14:46.911
You're the man-based.

14:48.072 --> 14:48.733
You're the man-based.

14:48.753 --> 14:49.354
You're the man-based.

14:49.374 --> 14:51.657
You're the man-based.

14:51.677 --> 14:52.198
You're the man-based.

14:52.218 --> 14:52.638
You're the man-based.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.159
You're the man-based.

14:53.179 --> 14:53.780
You're the man-based.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.681
You're the man-based.

14:54.701 --> 14:55.382
You're the man-based.

14:55.402 --> 14:55.922
You're the man-based.

14:55.942 --> 14:56.783
You're the man-based.

14:56.803 --> 14:57.444
You're the man-based.

14:57.464 --> 14:57.945
You're the man-based.

14:58.045 --> 14:58.806
You're the man-based.

14:58.826 --> 14:59.287
You're the man-based.

14:59.627 --> 15:00.809
You're the man-based.

15:00.829 --> 15:01.349
You're the man-based.

15:01.369 --> 15:01.850
You're the man-based.

15:01.870 --> 15:02.991
You're the man-based.

15:03.011 --> 15:03.572
You're the man-based.

15:03.592 --> 15:04.353
You're the man-based.

15:04.373 --> 15:05.074
You're the man-based.

15:06.370 --> 15:11.515
Is that a matter of policy?

15:11.595 --> 15:24.728
Is that one of the good people?

15:24.748 --> 15:25.669
Yes.

15:25.689 --> 15:29.993
The only reason we would have known someone to look at your dream was because of the fragile.

15:30.013 --> 15:30.594
I love that.

15:30.614 --> 15:30.854
I love that.

15:30.874 --> 15:32.335
I love that.

15:32.356 --> 15:32.596
I love that.

15:32.616 --> 15:32.856
I love that.

15:32.876 --> 15:33.116
I love that.

15:33.136 --> 15:33.377
I love that.

15:33.397 --> 15:33.637
I love that.

15:33.657 --> 15:33.897
I love that.

15:35.125 --> 15:41.955
That's wonderful.

15:42.015 --> 15:52.450
I don't know if I've heard of you.

15:52.510 --> 16:02.905
I'm going to cry with Tarot.

16:03.340 --> 16:16.034
This is something he did in a while.

16:16.054 --> 16:26.345
Now we've done some other units.

16:26.365 --> 16:27.306
Now this is much of a

16:27.691 --> 16:34.761
I'd also like to know, to tell you about what you're really racist in the heart.

16:34.781 --> 16:46.117
I'm really responsible for all some really old materials got to know from the University of the University.

16:46.137 --> 16:52.146
And when they come to that, you know, the blogger, the faculty group, where they've been started for a group, and so they're on a piece of paper, and a range of materials on that one.

16:52.649 --> 17:12.997
We have large collections about it, and we have different regions for a number of useful animals that have a way, a lot of functions in those terms, but in a certain way, the most personal that you keep in creating a memory.

17:13.017 --> 17:14.560
In events, other than 1-hour meeting, we're able to tell you that you're not.

17:14.580 --> 17:15.381
I don't know if you can tell them a lot.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.522
You have a special collection to get it to you.

17:16.542 --> 17:19.146
So, when I don't know how much Mark told you about how this project was cut to you, is that we were originally forced to continue.

17:19.312 --> 17:46.450
perfected it and one of those collections was so there are also extensive non-universities collections um over the years i've heard very similar

17:46.919 --> 18:13.208
And so the first collection is really .

18:13.228 --> 18:14.630
And so we have lots of collection in agriculture and family and stuff.

18:14.650 --> 18:16.031
In 1960, that was a collection of specific areas that were national .

18:16.051 --> 18:16.572
We have a collection of .

18:17.092 --> 18:41.732
So we need to respond.

18:42.370 --> 19:03.239
We need a faculty to return to the community and a person who can do what we call one more.

19:03.259 --> 19:05.041
We have historical, literary collections that were slightly different than what we heard.

19:05.061 --> 19:05.722
Literary collections you can use.

19:05.742 --> 19:07.264
Most of the historical, in terms of modern historical collections, there is.

19:07.598 --> 19:19.570
I'm returning from the university, you know, by any way.

19:19.590 --> 19:20.591
I can't argue that you have to get a little bit.

19:20.611 --> 19:22.793
So, I'm just saying, in terms of joint projects, we've done, we've said Utopia, basically.

19:22.813 --> 19:26.236
Utopia is a joint project that was done with this department.

19:26.256 --> 19:27.858
That is the history of art slide library and the architecture slide library.

19:27.878 --> 19:28.939
And I'll give you the basic images as you're a few.

19:28.959 --> 19:29.419
You want to spend time?

19:29.439 --> 19:31.181
From your realistic days of history.

19:31.201 --> 19:32.062
Again, this is an errorable to you as well.

19:32.082 --> 19:33.083
Can you tell me all of these art?

19:36.303 --> 19:47.960
Now, the actual utopian site, you really can't see the whole thing, because that's really limited to the Cornell community.

19:48.200 --> 19:53.868
And part of that is because it's usually slides from short libraries, for which we have license to do.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.130
They're not all slides, this is a problem.

19:55.150 --> 20:01.960
So this is, again, this is an adult saying, oh yeah, I can do this here.

20:01.980 --> 20:03.222
But this is not from, this is something that we're seeing.

20:05.142 --> 20:28.673
What's that symbol?

20:28.694 --> 20:29.074
What's that symbol?

20:30.522 --> 20:48.302
And this looks very much like what we saw for the birds, but it was on the field.

20:48.322 --> 20:49.023
And I think that was a certain way.

20:49.043 --> 20:49.303
I don't know.

20:49.323 --> 20:49.684
It looks terrific.

20:49.704 --> 20:51.146
And so a student was looking for images on a variety of ways to find it.

20:51.166 --> 20:55.571
And one of the professors in his field, she knew that she actually found it interesting.

20:55.591 --> 20:57.032
She saw connections that she had not seen before.

20:57.052 --> 20:59.335
She searched on musical instruments, pictures that actually had musical instruments.

20:59.355 --> 21:00.276
And they were very surprising.

21:00.560 --> 21:13.821
some combinations that you wouldn't see, otherwise, even working with cards.

21:13.841 --> 21:16.465
Because there's too many, there hasn't been any spread, but now it's too hard to run food for me.

21:16.485 --> 21:19.149
We've got the pictures online, and now I think I'm playing around with a little bit different.

21:19.169 --> 21:24.998
So, architecture, and I think eventually we will put images from books, you know, we took it back to a lot, so we're really interested in books, like, uh, for me to be included.

21:26.564 --> 21:32.011
Oh, yeah, sure.

21:32.031 --> 21:36.317
I'm hoping I'll have about ten minutes.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.038
Sure.

21:37.058 --> 21:38.540
Yeah, we can ask this.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.042
Yeah, we can ask this.

21:44.188 --> 21:48.334
Let's take this over a while.

21:48.354 --> 21:48.534
What now?

21:48.554 --> 21:48.995
What's your last name?

21:49.015 --> 21:49.976
What's your name?

21:49.996 --> 21:52.780
You really can't.

21:52.800 --> 21:52.960
At home.

21:56.787 --> 22:14.686
I think it's called MESL.

22:14.706 --> 22:15.947
M-E-S-L is Museum Educational Site Policy.

22:15.967 --> 22:16.988
Getting to a demo.

22:17.008 --> 22:20.332
This is a demonstration, sorry, that you can do a show of this at once.

22:20.352 --> 22:20.952
I'm only actually studying it.

22:20.972 --> 22:21.533
And what MESL actually is.

22:21.553 --> 22:22.774
This is a collaborative project between Canadians and Russia.

22:22.794 --> 22:23.535
None of these images are out there.

22:23.555 --> 22:24.796
So this is a project where we're getting the data from.

22:24.816 --> 22:25.257
We're serving it here.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.558
We're allowing students to do this in a very good point of view.

22:27.837 --> 22:44.120
projects in different classes.

22:44.140 --> 22:46.924
You can see first of what their classes are, I mean, what are the expectations are involved in this, you know, a whole host of that, maybe.

22:46.944 --> 22:47.564
You know, we get news or do it.

22:47.584 --> 22:47.645
Mm.

22:47.665 --> 22:48.866
Well, there's a person who's just coming in for her own.

22:48.886 --> 22:57.338
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my

22:58.094 --> 23:09.410
and you can really have here for students.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.134
It's a great thing called to a world.

23:12.154 --> 23:15.618
Last one was to quite a pandemic, and I'm just trying to remember my life.

23:15.638 --> 23:15.899
I'm not sure.

23:15.919 --> 23:16.179
Are you okay?

23:16.199 --> 23:17.161
You know who everybody knows what they're doing?

23:18.422 --> 23:22.568
I don't know if they're going to be doing that for sure, but I don't know if they're going to be doing that for sure, but I don't know if they're going to be doing that for sure.

23:22.588 --> 23:24.951
I don't know if they're going to be doing that for sure, but I don't know if they're going to be doing that for sure.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.093
I don't know if they're going to be doing that for sure.

23:26.495 --> 23:46.744
You've lost your word.

23:46.764 --> 23:53.313
Your hand up there.

23:53.333 --> 23:53.634
You've got one.

23:53.654 --> 23:53.914
That's right.

23:53.934 --> 23:54.014
Two.

23:54.034 --> 23:54.455
Go to the other side.

23:54.475 --> 23:54.655
The book.

23:54.675 --> 23:54.995
Hey, look at me.

23:55.015 --> 23:55.696
This is a pretty good sound budge.

23:55.716 --> 23:56.097
Give me a question.

23:57.173 --> 24:22.049
I, uh, I'm passionate about it.

24:22.069 --> 24:22.449
I can't believe it.

24:22.469 --> 24:22.850
I can't believe it.

24:22.870 --> 24:23.250
I can't believe it.

24:23.270 --> 24:23.651
I can't believe it.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.052
I can't believe it.

24:24.072 --> 24:24.452
I can't believe it.

24:24.472 --> 24:24.853
I can't believe it.

24:24.873 --> 24:25.253
I can't believe it.

24:25.273 --> 24:25.654
I can't believe it.

24:25.674 --> 24:26.054
I can't believe it.

24:26.074 --> 24:26.455
I can't believe it.

24:28.696 --> 24:42.530
And so this allows students to be able to search in the collection.

24:42.850 --> 24:51.999
Apart from the virtual conference repository, essentially a virtual repository.

24:52.019 --> 24:56.283
In terms of the security pages, I'd love to have spread them out to the museums that are happening to people.

24:56.303 --> 24:58.045
You know, the original tape is what we primarily don't do.

24:58.430 --> 25:05.999
That can be a work of flow.

25:06.119 --> 25:09.163
Exactly.

25:09.183 --> 25:13.348
And that's what we see all of these.

25:13.488 --> 25:14.529
They're very easy to update.

25:14.549 --> 25:19.355
If you look at some of the activities that certainly are quite a little.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.356
There are images in the book.

25:20.376 --> 25:22.779
Well, we should look for a book and have a book available for a link to a project like this.

25:22.799 --> 25:25.382
That all of these can link to a list of things that link in Finland.

25:26.425 --> 25:36.615
No, I do read as a way for more students and faculty to write their own comments.

25:36.635 --> 25:46.204
We suggest their own read, one that we have read, too, because they can't do it with any of the reason why there's research out there.

25:46.224 --> 25:48.526
So we only have the resources to do a whole lot of that.

25:48.546 --> 25:52.910
I just said, we're going to make archival copies of this to create a lot of research.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.291
It's quite from my own, which is kind of interesting.

25:54.311 --> 25:56.213
In terms of preserving, everybody knows how these things are going on.

25:56.699 --> 26:09.736
Well, you know, books say when you all have happened over the last two hundreds of years and taken care of properly in the last two hundreds of years.

26:09.756 --> 26:15.144
In fact, the other reality is that it's not seen with things that we do not have left before in this many years.

26:15.164 --> 26:15.985
We have reasonably expected to do that.

26:16.005 --> 26:17.607
You know, so if we don't know more technology here, we know we're not from here.

26:17.627 --> 26:18.588
We don't know how to do that, but we don't know.

26:18.608 --> 26:20.631
There has to be some means of our hiding material that it's continually over there.

26:21.168 --> 26:39.008
And that's a lot of information.

26:39.028 --> 26:39.749
And in this case, what's your phone?

26:39.769 --> 26:40.410
What is the problem with the CD?

26:40.430 --> 26:41.030
So I think that's the picture.

26:41.050 --> 26:41.411
And we don't know.

26:41.431 --> 26:41.791
And we don't know.

26:41.811 --> 26:42.232
So that's the answer.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.233
Yeah, for my mouth, that's not a good answer.

26:43.253 --> 26:43.954
Microphone is a small phone number.

26:43.974 --> 26:44.855
I don't know if any of them have to do that.

26:44.875 --> 26:45.215
So we keep going.

26:45.235 --> 26:45.736
Something that has to do.

26:45.756 --> 26:46.777
It's really, I don't know if we're working on this.

26:46.797 --> 26:47.237
We're working on this.

26:47.257 --> 26:47.698
We're working on this.

26:47.718 --> 26:48.298
We're working on this.

26:48.318 --> 26:48.759
We're working on this.

26:48.779 --> 26:49.159
What are standards?

26:49.179 --> 26:49.740
They're really on standards.

26:50.092 --> 26:53.377
It's all very new.

26:53.397 --> 27:01.689
So in the rush, the haste, to get rid of the bugs, the questionary tale, the questionary tale, well, it's not a tale, but the question is, the caveat is, hold on, hold on the urge us.

27:02.571 --> 27:12.225
For now, you know, I mean, right now, even though he doesn't have that situation, I think that's the only thing.

27:12.426 --> 27:14.208
I mean, it's just in the last 20 years.

27:14.228 --> 27:16.732
I can't hate, but I don't know.

27:16.752 --> 27:18.395
I don't know.

27:18.415 --> 27:18.715
I don't know.

27:20.230 --> 27:36.506
who let it sort of survive a positive person.

27:37.387 --> 27:39.930
I mean, the same change.

27:39.950 --> 27:46.997
What makes Sran in terms of these things that have really hated themselves, because what's important is that they

27:48.901 --> 28:03.128
The system, you need to know what systems are, but you need to be aware of what the data is and what the data is around.

28:03.148 --> 28:11.263
The data is really, really nice, powerful, though.

28:12.273 --> 28:18.940
So we are in the handling capacity.

28:19.680 --> 28:25.787
People don't look at your eyes.

28:25.807 --> 28:27.148
I'm not right now.

28:27.168 --> 28:31.592
I don't like that.

28:31.612 --> 28:32.433
I know the white system.

28:32.593 --> 28:35.076
We're looking for the next generation.

28:35.096 --> 28:40.561
What we have to be concerned about is that how this particular system works.

28:40.582 --> 28:41.082
I'd like to do.

28:41.990 --> 28:46.055
I can't help you with experts.

28:46.075 --> 28:48.238
They're still the most important.

28:48.258 --> 28:52.223
One way, where does lots of work?

28:52.243 --> 28:57.370
Lots of stuff, and it's for you.

28:57.390 --> 28:57.730
And it's for you.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.552
And it's for you.

28:59.573 --> 29:00.834
And it's for you.

29:00.854 --> 29:01.195
And it's for you.

29:01.215 --> 29:01.895
And it's for you.

29:01.916 --> 29:03.137
And it's for you.

29:03.157 --> 29:04.379
And it's for you.

29:04.399 --> 29:04.919
And it's for you.

29:05.120 --> 29:05.460
And it's for you.

29:05.480 --> 29:05.821
And it's for you.

29:05.841 --> 29:06.221
And it's for you.

29:06.241 --> 29:06.581
And it's for you.

29:06.602 --> 29:07.002
And it's for you.

29:07.387 --> 29:19.345
And what we're trying to do with them is our own selves.

29:19.566 --> 29:25.615
It is not right for the same thing that we don't want to get to do.

29:25.635 --> 29:26.997
That's what we have to do.

29:27.017 --> 29:27.718
That's what we have to do.

29:27.758 --> 29:28.820
That's what we have to do.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.142
That's what we have to do.

29:30.162 --> 29:31.324
That's what we have to do.

29:31.344 --> 29:31.944
That's what we have to do.

29:31.964 --> 29:33.246
That's what we have to do.

29:33.266 --> 29:34.288
That's what we have to do.

29:35.450 --> 29:51.747
I don't know, maybe that would be a question, you know, it would be an answer to why I don't think after you know, I don't think so in mind.

29:51.767 --> 29:52.908
I don't know.

29:52.948 --> 29:53.669
I don't know.

29:53.749 --> 29:54.810
I don't know.

29:54.830 --> 29:55.290
I don't know.

29:55.350 --> 29:56.351
I don't know.

29:56.371 --> 29:57.212
I don't know.

29:57.232 --> 29:59.014
I don't know.

30:00.576 --> 30:03.419
I don't know.

30:03.439 --> 30:04.620
I don't know.

30:04.640 --> 30:04.900
I don't know.

30:05.386 --> 30:08.991
If not, then, what is it you have?

30:09.011 --> 30:14.118
I guess somebody else will use all the solution for it, but it's not that bad.

30:14.638 --> 30:17.342
But I hope it goes well.

30:17.362 --> 30:21.227
Yes, you can read my dad and you do it any time.

30:22.469 --> 30:32.943
I hope you don't get it, but if you leave me, he wrote on this subject, you had better cut him down.

30:33.264 --> 30:33.604
Because...

30:34.850 --> 30:37.874
I can't tell you everything I do.

30:37.894 --> 30:40.156
You want a map to your city.

30:41.558 --> 30:45.282
Now, it's whatever the grind is to move back down.

30:47.124 --> 31:00.300
It may get you to a house, but it's not going to get you to a house, and it's not going to get you to a bookshop in that house.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.203
I'm sure what do you do, and how much

31:03.335 --> 31:23.301
Yeah, I like that too.
