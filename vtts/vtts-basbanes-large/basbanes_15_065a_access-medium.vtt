WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:04.354
All right.

00:06.617 --> 00:13.326
June 26th.

00:13.827 --> 00:17.552
I saw you at the 88 in Washington.

00:17.572 --> 00:18.152
And it was nice.

00:18.173 --> 00:19.034
I enjoyed it.

00:19.054 --> 00:20.015
You were the best friend?

00:20.235 --> 00:20.876
Yes.

00:21.497 --> 00:23.760
You followed the Helga fellow.

00:23.780 --> 00:24.481
Oh, really?

00:25.342 --> 00:26.784
I didn't know.

00:26.804 --> 00:28.026
Oh, really?

00:28.046 --> 00:28.647
I didn't know.

00:28.747 --> 00:30.169
Oh, really?

00:30.349 --> 00:31.911
I didn't know that.

00:32.515 --> 00:33.696
Anyway, where do we start?

00:34.137 --> 00:34.858
I enjoyed the book.

00:34.878 --> 00:38.301
I read it, believe it or not, in one sitting last night.

00:38.501 --> 00:43.066
It finished 2 a.m.

00:45.309 --> 00:51.996
So many of the things you've answered in the book, so I'll try to get some perceptions if that's OK.

00:52.496 --> 00:56.581
Do you have a sense of a place in history?

00:56.601 --> 01:00.565
And towards the end, you mentioned your son having read

01:01.591 --> 01:02.813
about you writing a street book?

01:04.956 --> 01:19.297
Yeah, probably, unless something happens to you, sir, it's drawn with image, it's drawn with image of me, it will be left, it will be to do with this terminal system.

01:19.317 --> 01:20.159
But any specifically reference?

01:20.539 --> 01:27.750
I think that my place was, I will be known as,

01:28.270 --> 01:29.712
of a compassionate agitator.

01:29.752 --> 01:32.455
They'll get tighter to me after I drop dead a little bit.

01:33.396 --> 01:44.790
But I think for people who don't like what I stood for and did, I will have been a kind of high American agitator.

01:44.810 --> 01:55.763
But I think that's much diminished now, that time of year, partly because it could have been proven over the years of proving that Vietnam is what it was.

01:56.317 --> 02:03.930
Do you suspect that you would be identified primarily with the Vietnam thing?

02:04.070 --> 02:05.112
I don't know.

02:06.033 --> 02:11.001
Passacists both singers of the 60s.

02:11.021 --> 02:19.255
You say that as kind of as I would expect that there would be more of what is the word you use?

02:19.275 --> 02:22.240
Kind of, I think.

02:22.726 --> 02:36.786
I think your position of non-violence goes for us.

02:36.926 --> 02:51.687
Elevated you, separated you from others.

02:52.274 --> 03:00.703
No, I mean, it makes it – it differentiates my politics to say politics of people who are pro-arm struggle.

03:01.004 --> 03:09.233
But those are lines that many – I would say the masses of American public never – did not make that differentiation.

03:09.934 --> 03:15.240
You say that you expect that maybe the perception of you may become kinder.

03:16.101 --> 03:17.863
Do you think that it already is?

03:18.143 --> 03:19.024
Yes, it is already.

03:19.240 --> 03:29.529
It is, and part of that really has to do with the, I mean, for two minutes, it took 20 years to be able to make the movie pretend and have people be able to go and see it.

03:29.549 --> 03:31.751
Do you feel that you've mellowed personally?

03:31.771 --> 03:37.676
I think we all mellow, and I think to pretend that we don't is really false, and we're all not going to change.

03:37.696 --> 03:47.425
You feel a pressure to, quote, not change, which is really childish, because the word mellow is alarming, because I come from California.

03:47.742 --> 03:56.571
You get laid back, and you don't go anywhere, you jam, and you don't relax and take tea.

03:56.591 --> 03:59.254
You kick back, and everybody gets mellow.

03:59.354 --> 04:09.025
But unfortunately, that means that I think maybe in the yuppie context... Well, that's a different thing.

04:09.085 --> 04:09.906
Less strength.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.507
Less angry, less dreading.

04:11.908 --> 04:12.108
Sure.

04:12.809 --> 04:15.892
Is that a product of the time, or a product of being 45?

04:15.912 --> 04:16.753
I think it's both.

04:17.476 --> 04:18.697
I mean, there are very few people.

04:18.717 --> 04:37.576
I mean, take a radical person who still really, according to the video I saw there, they like to be, in some ways, very young at heart and very, well, young in spirit, but still there's a mellowing process, and that became easy.

04:37.596 --> 04:45.744
I mean, I don't even know Ken, but just from watching that, really, I really love the spirit.

04:46.324 --> 04:47.145
Yeah.

04:47.817 --> 04:50.901
He looks like a middle-aged businessman.

04:50.921 --> 04:51.242
I know.

04:51.342 --> 04:54.826
The Andy Carter trial, it was so funny.

04:54.846 --> 04:57.870
I mean, he looks like he could have been a defense attorney.

04:57.890 --> 05:01.315
He's from Worcester, by the way.

05:01.335 --> 05:01.555
Oh, really?

05:01.575 --> 05:03.177
And Ginny Griffith, you know, Ginny Griffith.

05:03.197 --> 05:04.159
Ginny Griffith, you know.

05:04.179 --> 05:08.284
He's the one who's been here last year, and he's been here.

05:08.304 --> 05:08.865
And that's unfortunate.

05:08.885 --> 05:12.610
He really is, because it's the only time I ever met him.

05:12.944 --> 05:15.886
Again, you know, the British dress and everything.

05:15.907 --> 05:18.289
Well, he was doing a signing change that he could take.

05:19.730 --> 05:22.772
And the guy was in the 60s.

05:22.792 --> 05:26.796
You keep referring to the list of 60s.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.278
No, I don't list the 60s.

05:29.338 --> 05:31.420
There does seem to be a sense in here.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.642
You know what I suspect is my thing.

05:34.823 --> 05:42.529
I suspect that it may be a bit like mine not recognizing King's death until eight years later and then nine years after that.

05:42.762 --> 05:45.705
that I don't want to linger there.

05:45.986 --> 05:52.573
I really don't like 60s parties, the smell of peculia and you wear a headband and you go back to those days.

05:52.593 --> 05:53.955
I just thought I'm not interested.

05:54.175 --> 05:59.642
Now maybe, maybe I overreact to that.

05:59.862 --> 06:02.164
I mean, I don't listen to 60s music.

06:02.385 --> 06:03.426
I do one night a week.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.367
I'm very nice at home.

06:04.507 --> 06:11.335
Unfortunately, between 12 and 4 in the morning, the wonderful NPR show makes me crazy because I fall asleep in the middle of it.

06:11.753 --> 06:15.517
But he picked, in my opinion, the best of the music of the 60s.

06:15.537 --> 06:17.138
You know, a really good Joe Cocker.

06:17.158 --> 06:17.719
He wrote something about it.

06:18.059 --> 06:18.920
And I love that.

06:19.781 --> 06:20.782
I appreciate it.

06:20.802 --> 06:22.824
And I find I'll wake up smiling.

06:22.844 --> 06:25.887
You know, because it's just a good show with good music.

06:25.907 --> 06:32.073
But I don't have consciously, at any rate, a great nostalgia to be living in the 60s.

06:32.093 --> 06:39.280
Do you find yourself there's a line there when you were at the live age, and this stuff belongs to the 60s?

06:39.698 --> 06:51.458
And that can never be repeated.

06:51.478 --> 06:51.958
It can't.

06:51.978 --> 06:52.179
It can't.

06:52.199 --> 06:57.928
However, by the same token, do you feel alienated in any way by the youth?

06:58.169 --> 06:58.449
Absolutely.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.473
And I'm perfectly open about that.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.175
It doesn't mean I want back.

07:02.296 --> 07:06.162
I mean, I think partly because the 60s for me weren't a big party.

07:06.952 --> 07:10.537
And I didn't do drugs and hang out and, you know, drugs and sex and rock and roll.

07:10.618 --> 07:14.784
That's an important, another important aspect, I think.

07:14.964 --> 07:15.545
Yeah.

07:16.186 --> 07:21.794
It is, in that I was... In addition to the nonviolence, also the fact that you were in part of these drugs.

07:21.814 --> 07:25.500
I wasn't part of, no, watching the whole Ken Teese documentary,

07:25.818 --> 07:28.222
an hour and then another half hour on those days.

07:28.602 --> 07:34.011
I wasn't in any of those 16s.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.173
I didn't party.

07:35.573 --> 07:36.835
I didn't do drugs.

07:36.955 --> 07:40.942
I was in the South and in the Black Sea.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.163
Well, it's where?

07:42.183 --> 07:44.767
Well, drug-wise, I was absolutely there.

07:44.788 --> 07:49.615
You know, I mean, Allen Ginsberg, you know, so I was the hopeless for us to do it.

07:51.518 --> 08:03.631
Yeah, the alienation because even though I began as counterculture, counterculture became mainstream.

08:04.392 --> 08:10.719
And it was both persons as counterculture and both persons for civil rights and then against the one Vietnam.

08:10.739 --> 08:15.805
I feel as though I knew exactly what I was doing and I was right on track and eventually

08:16.122 --> 08:19.827
was really, people said, oh, yeah, well, I guess she was right.

08:19.847 --> 08:29.842
And also there was support during those times of just simply knowing, I mean, feeling it with such clarity that what I was doing was actually correct, and it was there to do.

08:29.882 --> 08:37.253
And you had supporters around you, and then you had a movement grow, two of them, the civil rights movement and then the anti-war movement.

08:37.273 --> 08:42.400
So in the 80s, the context is so amorphous.

08:42.650 --> 08:55.122
I mean, you can think what you want and do what you want, but in a context like the one we have now, which is whatever new faith you're given me, and nobody's ever really defined it to me, but it's unsubstantial.

08:55.162 --> 09:05.472
These times are unsubstantial, and if I have what I think is a very substantial point of view, the entire magazine three weeks ago sort of was saying, where are our ethics?

09:05.492 --> 09:06.093
Do we have any?

09:06.533 --> 09:11.678
So when you try to be an ethical and moral person with a viewpoint in the 80s,

09:12.856 --> 09:13.717
It doesn't really matter.

09:13.817 --> 09:16.622
There's quoting Time.

09:16.702 --> 09:18.324
That's kind of amusing that you would quote.

09:18.344 --> 09:18.925
Well, I do.

09:18.945 --> 09:20.547
But does that question bother you?

09:20.587 --> 09:21.869
Where are our ethics?

09:21.949 --> 09:23.111
Of course it does.

09:23.351 --> 09:32.765
And I quote Time because I'm sort of considered an old mag for saying things like, where are our ethical standards and where are our mags?

09:32.785 --> 09:36.070
But if it's on the cover of Time magazine, it's looked at in a different way.

09:36.691 --> 09:38.414
And it is a serious question.

09:38.514 --> 09:40.737
It was dealt with at length in time.

09:41.189 --> 09:49.020
You know, in naming the hundreds of people under indictment, I really think it was interesting.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.682
And I sort of went, whew.

09:50.762 --> 09:57.812
Even the traders, the so-called traders, the alleged traders, you know, Walker and the others, strictly greed.

09:57.992 --> 10:01.197
It's not even ideology anymore.

10:01.297 --> 10:07.045
At least some of the others, they had an ideological

10:07.497 --> 10:12.643
You know, the Rosenbergs people, you have to admire their commitments.

10:14.025 --> 10:16.007
This guy was strictly in a federal party.

10:16.027 --> 10:17.549
And that's contemptible, isn't it?

10:17.569 --> 10:24.257
Well, and I think the Iran gate hearings are like some bizarre kind of deadlines.

10:24.277 --> 10:25.358
They're a big so long.

10:26.780 --> 10:33.768
I mean, because, and it's not really the judgment of what they all have gone wrong.

10:33.848 --> 10:35.310
It's our reaction to what they did.

10:36.218 --> 10:47.991
In the book, again, I'm a book critic, so obviously I'm reading the style and the subtlety.

10:48.011 --> 10:58.243
You speak directly, by my count, to at least five people, to that point.

11:00.772 --> 11:24.805
Tell me about that.

11:25.021 --> 11:28.525
And there is bitterness in the going.

11:28.545 --> 11:29.567
There's no question about that.

11:29.587 --> 11:31.429
So it's not going to have to admit.

11:31.449 --> 11:32.730
I mean, especially there is.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.272
Yeah.

11:34.292 --> 11:36.375
Talk to you about bitterness.

11:37.356 --> 11:50.272
I think finding how you write about something like that, which is an enormously important part of my life, without being either sassy or sort of goody-key shoes or venting bitterness.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.796
I really try very hard to find in between and make it accurate.

11:54.248 --> 12:02.956
a combination of my idolatry and awe and appreciation for Dylan, and then the hurt.

12:04.838 --> 12:13.285
Have you ever been able to resolve, explain satisfactorily to yourself what happened in your... what happened?

12:13.446 --> 12:15.567
I can only explain to somebody what happened to me.

12:15.587 --> 12:18.210
I have no idea... Objectively, we can see what happened.

12:18.230 --> 12:19.011
There was a shaggy.

12:19.911 --> 12:21.673
But you see, one thing I...

12:22.345 --> 12:31.573
One thing I hope that I didn't try to do in the book anymore was try to leave anybody to believe that I had no understood Bob at all.

12:31.633 --> 12:34.696
And it's about sentimental, I think.

12:34.796 --> 12:40.341
It would have been very easy, I think.

12:40.722 --> 12:41.582
Yeah.

12:41.602 --> 12:45.626
And I thought you handled that very nicely.

12:46.407 --> 12:49.930
But you must have had some idea of his personality.

12:49.950 --> 12:50.250
What is it?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.352
He doesn't like to share greatness.

12:52.889 --> 12:56.554
Honestly, I honestly don't know.

12:57.135 --> 13:08.572
I mean, that I'd say about myself, you know, that my own struggle, and when the hippie comes over to sit with us, I hated her because I wasn't used to anybody getting paid as much attention as myself.

13:08.973 --> 13:12.298
You even mentioned grabbing for the microphone in the live.

13:19.822 --> 13:23.126
So these are the instincts, I guess, that they're on the plane.

13:23.146 --> 13:24.068
Right.

13:24.088 --> 13:27.452
It takes a certain personality and walk out in those lights in the face of it.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.856
So basically you're telling me you don't understand.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.958
No, I don't.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.482
I mean, I really understand almost from my side.

13:34.842 --> 13:37.165
And only that, partly.

13:37.526 --> 13:42.653
And I guess it's part of his nature to offer any explanation.

13:43.294 --> 13:47.179
Well, all I can say is no explanation is ever forthcoming, and I never expect it.

13:51.682 --> 13:56.610
the final meeting in the hotel room, why react to that thing?

13:56.630 --> 13:56.811
No idea.

13:58.814 --> 14:00.937
Again, it's trying to understand.

14:00.957 --> 14:02.300
It's trying to understand it.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.144
It's trying to totally not understand it.

14:05.164 --> 14:08.390
All I can do is control my actions to get out.

14:09.091 --> 14:12.076
That's the only time I come to my friends is if it isn't working well.

14:12.136 --> 14:15.782
What year was that chore, by the way?

14:19.593 --> 14:22.256
Right, yeah.

14:22.336 --> 14:26.060
That last scene was 85.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.943
So that's only two years ago.

14:28.963 --> 14:31.786
But you think that this is it?

14:31.806 --> 14:33.107
I think so.

14:33.127 --> 14:39.874
I mean, certainly what I wrote, you know, and folded it up and sent away, I was happy with.

14:39.894 --> 14:44.479
Do you hope that he will expect that he will read this?

14:48.763 --> 14:48.823
No.

14:50.002 --> 14:52.124
I jumped ahead of myself.

14:52.184 --> 15:01.453
Again, you said you recognized the first time that you saw him.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.516
You mentioned the first time you saw Dylan was the same thing.

15:04.616 --> 15:08.160
Is this the whole thing going to be on Dylan, or are you going to move on to something else?

15:08.180 --> 15:10.142
I'm going to move on to something else.

15:10.162 --> 15:11.904
So the first time I saw him?

15:11.924 --> 15:14.466
I'm just curious about recognizing what you saw.

15:14.486 --> 15:14.626
Genius?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.408
Yeah.

15:16.428 --> 15:17.469
I'm talking about equality.

15:17.649 --> 15:18.490
Yeah.

15:19.415 --> 15:27.204
No more going questions.

15:28.165 --> 15:31.810
Oh, I had one other one, but can I ask that?

15:31.930 --> 15:34.573
Did it bother you that he was not a social activist?

15:36.515 --> 15:37.457
I think so.

15:37.477 --> 15:42.302
I mean, I think that comes out clearly.

15:42.903 --> 15:46.948
Now, that may have been on a less conscious level part of fascination.

15:47.168 --> 15:47.869
I don't know.

15:48.254 --> 15:50.978
But I certainly, on a conscious level, was disappointed.

15:51.779 --> 15:52.881
And I had no right to be.

15:52.901 --> 15:57.627
He had never done anything that could give me any illusions about him in his day's life.

15:58.148 --> 15:58.208
OK.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.253
And the reason I ask is because it now leads us away from John.

16:02.515 --> 16:18.177
And maybe if you could just explain for me how or why it is rational for a celebrity using a performer and I, using the set you get to hear.

16:18.815 --> 16:25.422
in a proper time to enunciate, to articulate... To rationalize it?

16:25.562 --> 16:32.069
No, to project to political views of... What do I think of that?

16:32.089 --> 16:33.491
Or is it right or wrong?

16:33.631 --> 16:33.871
Yeah.

16:34.051 --> 16:35.853
Well, there's a propriety that they say.

16:37.415 --> 16:39.998
I don't understand.

16:40.018 --> 16:40.378
You know?

16:41.639 --> 16:44.783
I mean, it's something I never weighed, if you should I be doing this or not.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.965
It was something that I just granted

16:47.333 --> 16:51.919
And I'm sure I think it's for granted because I thought that it was on the side of good.

16:53.420 --> 17:00.429
From when I was very little in concerning myself with the ill to the world, quote unquote, in a quake or anything.

17:01.230 --> 17:07.497
It occurred to me that doing that and doing it in a broader sense because of the talent I've been given could be a thing of a good.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.361
What about?

17:10.581 --> 17:11.502
Maybe Hitler thought the same thing.

17:15.717 --> 17:18.080
It's questionable like that.

17:18.100 --> 17:26.809
Nevertheless, you know, I mean, acquiring visibility through one medium and every year that, too.

17:26.829 --> 17:35.138
Well, I suppose, you know, one of the things is we've lost faith in the wrong instance about doing what's right.

17:35.298 --> 17:38.241
It may be wrong, but I think we've got to follow them.

17:38.261 --> 17:40.163
And we're so afraid of it, you know.

17:40.864 --> 17:45.589
I mean, on that question, like, abortion, I remember reading an article about

17:45.940 --> 17:47.542
And what do you really think about it?

17:47.562 --> 17:54.509
Not what does the moral majority intimidate you into thinking and saying and what does somebody else, but what do you really feel about it?

17:54.529 --> 17:54.709
You know?

17:54.729 --> 18:01.417
If you were blessed with this beautiful voice, what do you think you would have done?

18:01.437 --> 18:02.378
If I were?

18:03.459 --> 18:03.719
Yes.

18:03.919 --> 18:04.099
Probably.

18:04.119 --> 18:13.990
But you did not have the voice to sing with, but... Well, see, those questions were so hypothetical because it's been a part of my life for so long.

18:14.729 --> 18:23.040
I mean, we can conjecture, or you might say, well, what if at this point I lost my voice?

18:24.321 --> 18:31.671
I think that there are probably by now, there are lots of ways for you to just feel so much harder to use.

18:31.691 --> 18:40.502
I just got vocalizing every day in the morning, and I just sit down on the guitar and get on with learning languages and reading and writing.

18:40.602 --> 18:42.384
I love to know it.

18:42.484 --> 18:44.567
No, I didn't have to do several of those stories.

18:45.290 --> 18:54.640
And she said she stopped singing too tired when she was at the very top of her form.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.722
She really did, actually.

18:56.782 --> 18:58.444
At the very top of her form.

18:58.464 --> 19:03.009
And I said, well, the time to go is when it's too soon and not too late.

19:03.029 --> 19:07.053
And making a number of sports analogies, Ted Williams going out on a home run.

19:07.254 --> 19:12.820
What I'm getting around to is, do you kind of feel the same way?

19:12.840 --> 19:15.162
Would you expect it?

19:15.749 --> 19:18.572
for the next 40 years.

19:18.653 --> 19:21.216
No, I think I probably have 10 or 15 years.

19:22.177 --> 19:35.373
And I think that the reason I wouldn't say 20 or 25 is that, say, for him it's never been a question of vocal quality.

19:35.393 --> 19:39.879
It's the way he communicates and forms on the banjo, and that's what he does.

19:40.099 --> 19:44.845
So much of what I do depends on work quality in the shape of something.

19:45.179 --> 19:48.202
And so when that begins to deteriorate, and it did once.

19:48.222 --> 19:49.944
And that's when I went and started doing myself.

19:50.044 --> 19:50.845
It was deteriorating.

19:50.865 --> 19:58.834
And it was such a blow to me because it was out of my realms of thought for anything that would ever go wrong with it.

19:58.854 --> 20:04.420
Then I think that I might want to be getting comfortable.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.503
Or I might be able to do exactly what I want to do.

20:07.563 --> 20:13.870
One of the things I enjoy doing in a situation like Argentina or Poland, going to a place that really interests me.

20:14.407 --> 20:15.548
I'm learning my support.

20:15.869 --> 20:17.731
It don't have to be an F.E.E.C.

20:17.751 --> 20:19.112
or a local forum.

20:19.132 --> 20:23.817
It's a combination of speaking with people and marketing with people and coming in a couple of weeks.

20:23.837 --> 20:28.382
It's not the formal business of presenting the company.

20:29.804 --> 20:33.748
On the way in today, I've got an advanced studio recording, which I enjoyed by the way.

20:33.768 --> 20:39.314
I kind of stuck the ambience for the interviews in order to listen to it.

20:39.334 --> 20:41.297
But that is the first studio recording in eight years.

20:41.477 --> 20:41.977
Is that right?

20:42.017 --> 20:42.898
Why is that?

20:42.998 --> 20:44.380
Why the eight years?

20:45.473 --> 20:56.322
Because for eight years, either they weren't interested in me, or I couldn't do it anymore.

20:56.342 --> 20:59.064
Because then, meaning they mainly... Do you mean the industry?

20:59.104 --> 21:00.746
Yes, the industry.

21:00.766 --> 21:05.009
I had to forge whatever my position was now in the industry.

21:05.029 --> 21:09.533
And that was just, you know, it shocked me, because in the beginning, I didn't.

21:10.514 --> 21:15.278
The music has come about a hundred years ago, from small to beautiful.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.902
introspection, melody, words, social commentary.

21:20.163 --> 21:21.524
Totally the opposite.

21:21.544 --> 21:21.845
Rhythm.

21:21.865 --> 21:25.329
If there are good words, you can't hear them.

21:25.349 --> 21:27.551
Except Brothers in Arms.

21:28.212 --> 21:33.277
It was written by probably one of the two or three top rock groups in the world right now.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.919
Nobody's ever heard those words.

21:34.939 --> 21:36.841
There's just one book.

21:36.861 --> 21:38.182
And it's a beautiful song.

21:38.203 --> 21:44.169
You can break around and find them, but the people are not interested in projecting words.

21:45.070 --> 21:45.130
So,

21:45.734 --> 21:50.098
And I couldn't... Is it also that audiences are interested in hearing them, too?

21:50.398 --> 21:54.382
Well, miraculously for me, I go on having audiences.

21:54.402 --> 21:56.104
I don't have five audiences.

21:56.324 --> 21:58.206
I did for 10 or 15 years.

21:58.326 --> 22:05.693
But it is sort of astounding that I go on concert tours and people show up on a large scale, much larger in Europe.

22:05.713 --> 22:07.034
Everywhere but here, larger.

22:09.356 --> 22:15.522
You know, trying to have that to fall back on, but I really want to see what... Everywhere but here, meaning...

22:15.788 --> 22:17.449
Why is that?

22:18.631 --> 22:20.412
You know, I'm not really sure.

22:20.432 --> 22:25.397
I tried to deal with it, you know, try to sort of guess at it a little bit in the book, but I'm not really sure.

22:25.417 --> 22:31.262
I think that somewhere like Germany, for instance, only three or four thousand people will show up.

22:31.662 --> 22:35.345
No record, no video, no MTV, no current stuff.

22:35.826 --> 22:39.409
So, timelessness in Europe will take you thought of it.

22:39.469 --> 22:45.154
Here it has to be timely, too, and two months later it's going to be another group and another group.

22:45.505 --> 22:49.111
I have a timelessness with certain people who will show up there.

22:51.274 --> 22:59.066
And the last couple of years, you know, I've spread out to younger people somewhere.

22:59.086 --> 23:05.115
But I think that has to be with political atmosphere as well.

23:05.135 --> 23:05.215
Hmm.

23:07.218 --> 23:08.220
Again, you're a young woman.

23:09.642 --> 23:11.665
Do you feel nevertheless that?

23:13.298 --> 23:22.587
I don't know.

23:23.287 --> 23:35.518
I really would be sad to look at it as though if I ended up living day to day and keeping aware of what was going on around me.

23:36.599 --> 23:38.922
And so that was when I had to find that.

23:38.942 --> 23:41.584
I mean, I think my Quakerism comes in very handy.

23:42.104 --> 23:47.411
you go on listening to the still small voice you're in and it still tells you something and gives you guidance.

23:47.952 --> 24:03.753
I think I have to have a completely open view that if in ten years that whatever happens cyclically, that it's time for an international non-violent crusade, I want to be there.

24:04.454 --> 24:08.960
If that never happens, I want to be a good road crewman.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.503
Except, however, when they're speaking directly to Dr. King.

24:12.361 --> 24:16.026
You say, I want to regain the sureness of commitment.

24:16.407 --> 24:16.507
I do.

24:16.527 --> 24:19.451
And directness to go back out.

24:19.471 --> 24:19.832
I do.

24:19.852 --> 24:21.514
And that's exactly what I'm saying.

24:21.935 --> 24:24.118
If that time comes around, I'll be there.

24:24.579 --> 24:28.805
But I want to have the sense to know if it doesn't.

24:28.845 --> 24:35.414
In 1964, there was bus integration in Mississippi and Alabama.

24:35.714 --> 24:39.600
And people got beat up by the accident, and then he's thrown off the bus because nobody ever heard about it.

24:40.458 --> 24:45.603
And I like to think that a little bit of political savvy after 30 years will serve me.

24:45.804 --> 24:48.186
I don't want to do those things until they really make sense.

24:48.927 --> 24:51.770
Absolute sense to me, and a public sense.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.433
Gandhi was a student for that.

24:54.453 --> 25:03.021
And Gandhi had that overall sense, spiritually, personally, tomorrow we're going to break the British salt tax, and we're going to have two million people with that.

25:03.462 --> 25:07.526
I think a little bit at 45, I really don't want to waste energy.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.368
It doesn't mean...

25:11.221 --> 25:16.887
I think that I have to be very, very open to when those things will be right and be willing to do them.

25:16.907 --> 25:20.411
But we shouldn't read into this that you are a social activist in search of a cause.

25:20.731 --> 25:22.032
That's exactly what I'm saying.

25:22.052 --> 25:22.493
I'm not.

25:23.153 --> 25:27.678
That if I were, I could be arrested any time of day, anywhere, for a variety of things.

25:27.698 --> 25:33.284
I really am not interested in, number one, doing that to prove that I'm still a social activist.

25:33.304 --> 25:37.228
Or two, it's simply pleasing other people's ideas of what they think they should be doing.

25:37.462 --> 25:41.948
And people will plead and say, oh, why aren't you here?

25:42.549 --> 25:43.651
Why aren't you doing that?

25:43.771 --> 25:48.117
And all I can say is that I have to wait to be properly dictated to do it.

25:49.599 --> 26:07.283
One incident you discussed in the book, and I should have remembered this, but to verify that when the vote-keeping were open, you pointed the finger at the Vietnamese government.

26:08.562 --> 26:16.730
funny, kind of ironic way, in a very brief period, it became almost the dialing of the opposite of the right wing.

26:17.751 --> 26:19.813
Not of the right wing, but of those elements.

26:19.913 --> 26:20.674
Well, it's the right wing.

26:20.694 --> 26:28.802
I mean, some, two of my boat, the two original boat people who came to my living room came to the first book signing I had, and I was in Alexandria.

26:29.162 --> 26:30.103
It was very moving.

26:30.123 --> 26:31.624
I feel very, very close to them.

26:32.565 --> 26:35.548
What people didn't understand was that

26:36.676 --> 26:42.044
I was never a promoter of the Illinois government, and I've never been a promoter of arms struggle.

26:42.785 --> 27:02.312
But as I was saying earlier, that line between myself and, say, somebody like Jane Fonda, who has supported arms struggle and supported the Illinois regime, and when POW came out on the wires in just something like 1978, something like that, was saying,

27:03.153 --> 27:11.101
We talked about being tortured, the claims we had been tortured, and the message from Jane or from her people was, couldn't be.

27:12.043 --> 27:13.224
So things are happening.

27:13.244 --> 27:15.146
So I sent mine in mighty quick.

27:18.069 --> 27:27.659
But you see, I don't have, I mean, I understand why people assumed I was a leftist.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.164
I was working with leftists from early 60s until the mid-70s.

27:32.532 --> 27:33.773
Because that's who you work with.

27:33.793 --> 27:41.402
When I work to get somebody out of a Siberian gulag, then I'm working with right-wing people who are having the ideas and the inertia.

27:41.422 --> 27:44.826
And they're to the right of Jean Kirkpatrick and Gendrit Kahn.

27:45.387 --> 27:54.537
And I love them anyway, and I'll slice them to the end on their miserable one-sided opinions about who's all right and about the evil empire.

27:55.158 --> 27:59.923
I mean, I really do know people from the far parts of both of those camps.

28:00.292 --> 28:04.057
Would you say you're non-political in this space?

28:04.137 --> 28:09.284
I think if you say, I think you're the best thing to say with John Deere.

28:09.304 --> 28:14.311
I think when people ask to say, what, if you say non-political, it's just one of those sort of non-words.

28:15.092 --> 28:15.913
I'm non-partisan.

28:18.877 --> 28:21.460
And really, in my gut, I'm non-partisan.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.501
I don't have a favorite.

28:22.561 --> 28:27.548
I loathe the violence of both camps utterly and completely and easily.

28:28.321 --> 28:45.585
Were you disappointed that Pondra didn't... I remember I was at the time because I was so wrapped up in what we were doing and the evidence was so clear that I was a little surprised at some people and not a surprise for others.

28:45.605 --> 28:49.050
You know, I appreciated my thoughts on the book.

28:49.070 --> 28:54.117
It comes to a blunt sort of... I'm not very intelligent.

28:54.217 --> 28:56.320
It's got to be made to criticize the socialists, doesn't it?

28:56.603 --> 28:58.865
About the choice he's made, so, okay.

28:58.885 --> 28:59.646
I understand that.

29:00.967 --> 29:09.655
I've never heard that place before, but I don't have a watch.

29:09.675 --> 29:11.517
I just left mine off at a tree.

29:12.558 --> 29:12.658
Okay.

29:12.678 --> 29:15.060
I mean, how much?

29:15.581 --> 29:15.761
You okay?

29:15.781 --> 29:16.001
20 minutes?

29:16.161 --> 29:16.642
I'm doing fine.

29:17.002 --> 29:18.364
I'm going to check on the machine here.

29:18.724 --> 29:25.210
I thought it was on about a little before 20 hours.

29:25.493 --> 29:28.217
Okay, well, why don't we just hear it for you a minute?

29:28.237 --> 29:31.301
Can I, is it possible to get a color photo of you, by the way?

29:32.683 --> 29:33.865
From somebody, you mean?

29:33.885 --> 29:35.427
From one of your publicity people.

29:35.447 --> 29:35.748
Oh, I see.

29:35.768 --> 29:36.349
Let me see what we have.

29:36.369 --> 29:37.731
I'll ask Nancy.

29:37.751 --> 29:39.433
Ask Nancy.

29:39.493 --> 29:41.696
If I get a color photo, we can do a cover.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.060
We can do a magazine.

29:44.140 --> 29:45.822
Okay, let me always apply to something in the office.

29:45.842 --> 29:48.126
That would be good.

29:48.146 --> 29:52.632
Again, the book speaks for itself, so I hate to ask questions when she's not answered.

29:53.422 --> 29:55.564
rather eloquently in the work.

30:04.113 --> 30:06.535
Again, talking directly to individuals.

30:07.236 --> 30:11.641
Was this something that just developed in the writing of the book?

30:11.661 --> 30:16.245
Yeah, because when you say there are X numbers, X many people, I didn't know that.

30:16.386 --> 30:16.806
That was used to you?

30:16.826 --> 30:17.286
Yeah.

30:17.307 --> 30:18.788
I guess when it starts to sort of

30:19.291 --> 30:21.434
Maybe it's a way of putting a lid on gushing.

30:21.474 --> 30:25.600
If I can tell it directly to somebody, I feel a little less sloppy.

30:26.221 --> 30:31.588
Because I'm trying to say something a little more emotional.

30:31.688 --> 30:34.151
It does jump right out when it's done.

30:34.171 --> 30:40.540
And I think the most eloquent one, of course, is the Martin Luther King.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.181
That would be a good one.

30:42.022 --> 30:47.530
I haven't asked you about the Al Tapp thing.

30:50.414 --> 30:51.655
You can laugh about it now.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.179
I couldn't stand at all.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.040
Really.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.183
You couldn't sue him.

30:57.283 --> 30:58.405
Why not?

30:59.045 --> 31:01.789
Well, first of all, I'm not up high.

31:03.251 --> 31:03.832
I'm not up high.

31:05.134 --> 31:07.277
But, I mean, I knew it wasn't that.

31:07.297 --> 31:09.700
You're not a litigator, should we say.

31:10.490 --> 31:12.672
It would have been embarrassing to see that.

31:12.692 --> 31:13.693
He was probably asking.

31:13.713 --> 31:15.115
He probably would love to have had it.

31:15.355 --> 31:15.815
Well, sure.

31:15.835 --> 31:18.258
I used to meeting my manager and saying, why did she stop?

31:18.278 --> 31:18.838
And she did.

31:19.039 --> 31:24.184
It's the best of Rupert he'd had in years.

31:24.204 --> 31:36.056
Another thing I didn't realize is that, again, going back to the 60s, one would just assume that you and Farmer and some of the other more visible anti-war activists were friendly.

31:36.136 --> 31:40.140
And you said you probably met her once or twice.

31:40.160 --> 31:40.260
Yeah.

31:40.747 --> 31:52.204
And you see, a lot of times, the things that I was involved in, the marches and what have you, were run directly under like a nonviolent wing.

31:52.925 --> 32:01.698
You know, like when we were arrested for ADN and the activists, we were arrested in the induction center.

32:02.138 --> 32:07.446
Half of this would move with everybody, and eventually we would just have to take half of the stage.

32:07.578 --> 32:11.944
People would be saying, we're going down there, we're going this, we're going that.

32:12.886 --> 32:14.468
However we want to behave is up to us.

32:14.508 --> 32:16.891
And the pastors would eventually pull away.

32:16.911 --> 32:20.576
But I really didn't want to be involved with a bunch of people.

32:20.616 --> 32:21.778
I mean, it's interesting.

32:21.798 --> 32:23.861
You see it in Seoul.

32:24.322 --> 32:29.209
The paper, if you read carefully, is student leaders took the police back to faith.

32:29.229 --> 32:32.353
So you know the leadership has a discipline, and they probably

32:32.671 --> 32:38.280
would like to out-vote selling fire, kerosene bombs were heavy, but they can't control it.

32:38.601 --> 32:40.363
So we were wanting to control.

32:40.624 --> 32:44.169
This is our state, and we were called the leaders and what have you.

32:44.190 --> 32:48.857
But I would rather sing to the police, you know, than call them pigs.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.940
It doesn't make any sense to me.

32:51.762 --> 32:56.850
I think the way you make human change is by seriously attempting to change people.

32:56.870 --> 32:58.813
What about that Angela Davis episode?

33:02.168 --> 33:04.952
Oh, yeah, it's so awful.

33:05.753 --> 33:09.759
Wasn't the frightening part that was so awful, it was the demoralizing part.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.221
Well, was it veiled threat, was it?

33:11.242 --> 33:11.582
Yeah, I guess so.

33:11.742 --> 33:18.332
Well, you know, this guy who stayed over and he said, don't worry, I know niggas going to be throwing bricks at 9 o'clock in the morning on Tuesday.

33:18.633 --> 33:21.817
That probably spared us from more worry than we would have had.

33:21.837 --> 33:22.919
You know, we would have had more.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.982
He's sort of saying, you know, there.

33:27.726 --> 33:28.087
Hello?

33:28.888 --> 33:29.689
Yes?

33:29.709 --> 33:30.370
Yes, ma'am.

33:30.822 --> 33:32.984
Sure.

33:33.004 --> 33:37.489
I think it was one seven up taking it.

33:37.509 --> 33:44.016
I think I would play this stuff.

33:44.036 --> 33:47.480
On the Rolling Thunder, that came through Worcester.

33:47.660 --> 33:49.342
I don't know if you were in that one.

33:49.642 --> 33:51.825
Well, I was in all of the Rolling Thunder shows.

33:52.205 --> 33:54.047
I mean, the two tours that went out.

33:54.307 --> 33:59.513
It was a great show.

34:00.505 --> 34:03.448
Okay, could you, would you describe this to my two?

34:04.710 --> 34:06.652
I didn't realize that you started it.

34:06.932 --> 34:25.893
I was writing the book in, this was in 1974, just before the period, you know, and we were at the time of, about the three of some of you who were in the book, Hanoi, and Kim, and Marlon Brando, and Japan.

34:26.153 --> 34:26.293
Mm-hmm.

34:27.050 --> 34:30.634
And then I got some sort of bizarre block and I didn't write.

34:30.654 --> 34:33.858
And then I finally put it all away after two months and didn't go back to the food.

34:35.260 --> 34:39.284
Was it a, what's the verb?

34:40.346 --> 34:43.469
Did you feel that you wanted to tell your story or you wanted to write?

34:44.451 --> 34:51.279
I mean, was it a... Well, I love to write, but I think I wanted to... Putting a life on the record, so to speak?

34:51.299 --> 34:55.263
I think so, for myself and for whoever I was interested in.

34:55.283 --> 34:56.685
Updating things like that kind of...

34:56.834 --> 34:58.136
Okay.

35:00.039 --> 35:01.000
Thank you.

35:02.182 --> 35:04.425
I just reread it this summer.

35:04.445 --> 35:11.455
And there is so much in that novel that it almost looks as though I stole a lot of stuff in it.

35:11.675 --> 35:17.003
It really, I mean, I could almost be accused of pleasure when they said that I hadn't read it for 20 years.

35:17.544 --> 35:20.207
I think I read it for 25 years, but I'm amazing.

35:20.227 --> 35:22.070
Well, it's amazing.

35:22.631 --> 35:23.993
It is exactly the same.

35:24.033 --> 35:25.575
Washington has not changed.

35:26.618 --> 35:30.342
In a hundred and some years.

35:30.362 --> 35:37.150
I was very pleased to see that Marty Nolan at the Washington Globe when he wrote a piece about my book, did compare it to democracy.

35:38.411 --> 35:44.438
But I don't think anybody has written a comedy of manners about Washington like that.

35:44.458 --> 35:52.086
That is how you would classify it as a comedy of manners, satire.

35:52.690 --> 35:55.314
on, you know, well, it had two layers.

35:55.334 --> 35:59.200
I mean, there's that layer, and then there's the layer of that relationship with the grill.

36:00.362 --> 36:02.545
Was it fun that you were in our work now?

36:02.565 --> 36:03.287
Oh, I love it.

36:03.307 --> 36:05.069
I know that it is fun.

36:05.270 --> 36:16.768
I saw you as an EDA in New Orleans, and I remember you were saying, you know, you had this baby, and it was like a fire horse here, and so, and you were desperate to get out there.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.150
Tell me stories.

36:18.590 --> 36:20.233
You must miss the deadline.

36:20.399 --> 36:20.820
I don't.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.221
If I did, I'd do it.

36:22.742 --> 36:25.686
I mean, people are saying, honestly, don't you really miss it?

36:25.706 --> 36:27.448
Well, if I did, I'd do it.

36:27.468 --> 36:28.489
There's nothing stopping me.

36:28.549 --> 36:31.914
I can go back and write to the post any time I want to.

36:31.934 --> 36:36.860
I mean, one of the reasons I left is because it didn't turn me on anymore.

36:36.880 --> 36:37.120
Really?

36:37.781 --> 36:37.941
Yeah.

36:38.021 --> 36:39.443
I mean, I just kind of got tired of it.

36:39.463 --> 36:40.705
You don't miss that.

36:40.725 --> 36:41.506
The stories are so great.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.228
We have the postions.

36:43.548 --> 36:46.592
You know, you go through different things.

36:47.315 --> 36:50.038
I mean, when I was young, I liked to date a lot.

36:50.138 --> 36:54.703
You know, I liked to go up with lots of different guys and go to parties every night, and I don't like to do that.

36:54.843 --> 36:59.389
I go out and I used to go to this boat, this boat until two, three in the morning.

36:59.409 --> 37:01.511
Okay, I don't like that anymore.

37:01.531 --> 37:03.553
I like to, I love being married.

37:03.573 --> 37:04.614
I love my baby.

37:04.634 --> 37:09.960
I like to stay home at night with my husband or go to, you know, dinners and be home by 11 o'clock at night.

37:10.521 --> 37:13.845
You change when the things depend on you.

37:13.865 --> 37:14.666
Can we use it, please?

37:14.726 --> 37:15.146
I will.

37:15.166 --> 37:15.887
You need a pen?

37:16.306 --> 37:17.592
Can I tell?
