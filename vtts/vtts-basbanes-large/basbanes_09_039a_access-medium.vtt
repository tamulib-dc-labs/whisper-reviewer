WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:06.052
Test one, two, test, test, test, test, test, test, test.

00:06.072 --> 00:07.895
My arm.

00:07.915 --> 00:09.117
Look how small these things are getting.

00:10.999 --> 00:22.055
Boy, Pat, you know, after four interviews, we want to cover the same material, but you did say to me once that you always start a book with an idea, a single idea.

00:23.156 --> 00:23.958
Is that the same case?

00:23.978 --> 00:24.478
Is that the case?

00:24.518 --> 00:25.139
That's my mother.

00:26.782 --> 00:29.886
I knew, even when Mom's dying, you know, I knew that, you know,

00:30.237 --> 00:42.292
Because she was so young, because her death took us by surprise, because my mother had seemed immortal to me, I knew I was coming up with one of those big events.

00:43.253 --> 00:52.805
And something that sheer helplessness of, you know, saying by watching your mother die, will you do anything for the woman and you can do nothing but watch and be a witness?

00:53.786 --> 00:57.190
And so that was the single idea that began this book.

00:57.338 --> 00:59.460
And what year did she die, by the way?

00:59.480 --> 01:00.601
She died in 1984.

01:00.621 --> 01:02.042
Okay.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.184
So it was two years before the Prince of Ties.

01:04.204 --> 01:04.725
Right.

01:04.745 --> 01:05.866
So while you were working on it.

01:05.886 --> 01:07.487
Well, yeah, I was trying to finish Prince of Ties.

01:07.607 --> 01:08.148
Mom was dying.

01:09.950 --> 01:10.610
Okay.

01:11.111 --> 01:13.833
And so the idea was the death of the... Yeah.

01:13.853 --> 01:21.260
But then how do you transform that idea into what... Not transform, but how does it germinate?

01:21.280 --> 01:22.821
Well, it turns into something else.

01:22.841 --> 01:24.763
I mean, it always...

01:25.418 --> 01:30.065
You know, when I wrote this one, that was college life, when I wrote The Great Santana's Childhood.

01:30.185 --> 01:31.707
I mean, that was the one idea.

01:32.168 --> 01:40.840
And whatever alchemy takes place in, you know, these ideas becoming fiction, characters start appearing out of the mist.

01:42.723 --> 01:46.568
Stories I've collected over the years, stories that I have loved.

01:48.130 --> 01:52.036
There's one in this book that I've brought with me from college.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.379
There's a Lost at Sea chapter.

01:54.764 --> 01:57.729
And I had been trying to fit that in every book I have ever read.

01:57.989 --> 02:00.553
And I finally found a place here.

02:00.674 --> 02:01.835
Kind of like the tiger story.

02:01.896 --> 02:03.979
Like the tiger story was out of my childhood.

02:04.079 --> 02:06.042
And you refused to cut that out of your book?

02:06.062 --> 02:07.985
Well, I had been carrying this tiger story.

02:08.686 --> 02:10.730
But I had adored this tiger story.

02:10.750 --> 02:14.316
You know, Nan tried to cut it out of The Prince of Times.

02:14.336 --> 02:15.558
You know, I didn't want to.

02:15.938 --> 02:17.020
Same case in this.

02:17.040 --> 02:17.681
No, she didn't like it.

02:17.781 --> 02:21.447
I mean, Nan goes nuts whenever she calls him my...

02:22.051 --> 02:23.433
Oh, those animals again.

02:23.473 --> 02:25.757
You know, she said, you know, Nan's from New York.

02:26.639 --> 02:31.327
You know, when I have a manta ray in this thing, Nan does not understand.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.012
To her, a manta ray is just, you know, seafood.

02:34.132 --> 02:35.054
You know, she has no idea.

02:35.094 --> 02:35.494
Seafood.

02:35.514 --> 02:40.182
You know, if you can't eat it, you know, Nan doesn't want to even know about it.

02:40.964 --> 02:46.253
And so she always, we always have a little bit of tension when any of these nature chapters come up.

02:46.402 --> 02:48.044
Nan likes dinner parties.

02:48.365 --> 02:51.890
But these are stories that you... These are silly stories.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.452
It's carried with me from the South.

02:53.833 --> 03:05.029
You know, my feeling is, and I think I'll say that in this piece, whatever...see, the guy who reviewed this for Time misses it.

03:05.049 --> 03:07.472
And I think the person who ever reviewed it for PW got it.

03:08.073 --> 03:12.780
What you are is, I think, our greatest living storyteller.

03:12.997 --> 03:15.899
You know, here's one thing I know.

03:15.919 --> 03:20.003
Any time is I love story.

03:20.283 --> 03:26.488
One of the things I have that differs from the critical establishment is they seem to hate story.

03:26.969 --> 03:28.330
They seem to loathe story.

03:28.530 --> 03:31.793
And to me, story is the holiest thing.

03:32.834 --> 03:35.035
It is what was told around the campfire.

03:35.095 --> 03:37.137
It began narrative.

03:37.157 --> 03:38.018
It began everything.

03:38.058 --> 03:42.902
It is the most basic, primitive, prehistoric thing we have.

03:43.237 --> 03:45.921
I don't like reading books that have none.

03:46.281 --> 03:49.405
I just interviewed a woman Monday, and I really recommend this book to you.

03:49.786 --> 03:52.430
It's called The Liar's Club, and it's amazing.

03:52.530 --> 03:53.151
I got it.

03:53.171 --> 03:53.832
I bought it.

03:54.212 --> 03:54.633
It's great.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.635
It's spectacular.

03:56.655 --> 04:01.722
And she's just writing about two little years in her life, 61, 62, and 61, and 63, 62, 63.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.569
And it's memory.

04:06.869 --> 04:10.715
She didn't really try to verify the stuff, but it's telling these stories.

04:11.015 --> 04:12.417
And what she said about...

04:12.953 --> 04:16.898
She told me in the interview, I said, the voice is really something.

04:16.918 --> 04:23.125
This will relate to you, because you told me years ago, the first storyteller you knew was this Greek guy.

04:24.387 --> 04:27.651
I forget his name, stuff, whatever his name was, the grandfather.

04:27.771 --> 04:28.572
Yes, yes.

04:28.972 --> 04:31.055
Even though he didn't write, he told stories.

04:31.075 --> 04:32.617
He was the first fiction writer you knew.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.559
She said, this is an homage to my father.

04:34.879 --> 04:37.122
The Liars Club is where they used to sit around and

04:37.642 --> 04:40.285
and, you know, trade stories, and so they were all liars.

04:40.346 --> 04:43.490
She said, this is an homage, the voice is an homage to my father.

04:44.291 --> 04:47.475
And I said, because this is, she's telling stories here.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.396
It's a memoir.

04:48.937 --> 04:54.284
Who gives a shit about two years in East Texas to a dysfunctional family?

04:54.404 --> 04:59.671
I mean, but you elevate it, and you make those care, and that's what storytelling, I think, is.

05:00.132 --> 05:01.634
I'm going off on a tangent here.

05:01.694 --> 05:03.396
I'm sorry, but I think this is kind of...

05:04.321 --> 05:06.464
It's related to what you're saying.

05:06.484 --> 05:08.127
It's the one thing I care about deeply.

05:08.928 --> 05:16.038
It's... I want to see... Also, stories have to move me.

05:16.940 --> 05:20.465
If I'm not moved, I will not write them.

05:20.485 --> 05:22.388
You're what, 48, 49 years old?

05:22.408 --> 05:23.770
I'll be 50 in October.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.773
Wow.

05:25.793 --> 05:26.153
Okay.

05:26.874 --> 05:27.675
Well, I'm 52.

05:27.996 --> 05:33.484
And I have to tell you, on my 52nd birthday, which was last month in May...

05:34.055 --> 05:37.481
I told Alan Peacock, he said, what are you so sad about?

05:37.521 --> 05:40.145
I said, you know who died on his 52nd birthday?

05:40.526 --> 05:41.487
Shakespeare.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.814
When Shakespeare died on April 23rd, he died on his 52nd birthday.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.378
That's really depressing.

05:48.398 --> 05:51.584
I'm so sorry you told me that.

05:51.604 --> 05:53.266
Nick, shame on you.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.630
He said, most guys, it's related with their father.

05:55.810 --> 06:00.518
I said, oh, when I passed Keats at 26, and I mean, I've noted them all.

06:00.953 --> 06:07.961
but on the actual birthday, I said, being 40, 50 didn't bother me at all, but anyway, you are approaching your 50th birthday.

06:08.421 --> 06:12.105
Let's say you're kind of halfway through this experience.

06:13.166 --> 06:20.514
Maybe you're halfway through the experience of being, and have you assessed your body of work to have a sense of what you've accomplished and where you're going with it?

06:20.534 --> 06:25.780
This is a very general question, because all of your books, and we will get into the

06:26.350 --> 06:28.932
as we have to, because everybody asks you about it.

06:28.952 --> 06:36.019
And I saw one interview with Marley where you say, you kind of backed off the autobiographical element in the fiction just a little bit.

06:36.039 --> 06:39.543
I know people think that everything I write happened.

06:39.563 --> 06:42.786
Yeah, well, I mean, we have to be clear about that.

06:43.326 --> 06:45.849
I'm talking generally, but have you assessed?

06:46.609 --> 06:51.814
You know, this was, here's what, is I did not know how to go about being a writer, Nick.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.598
No one has ever come up more innocently

06:56.253 --> 07:08.732
I was this kid who moved every year with this Marine Corps father all throughout the South, the southern swamps, where the Marines loved to build their bases.

07:11.957 --> 07:15.903
I had this ambition to be a writer because my mother wanted to be.

07:16.223 --> 07:17.004
I didn't know how to do it.

07:17.625 --> 07:18.647
I did not know writers.

07:18.767 --> 07:20.670
I'm always amazed now on these writing programs.

07:21.491 --> 07:24.235
We didn't have writing programs at the Citadel.

07:24.738 --> 07:27.762
There was not a writer I could go to that could tell me how to do it.

07:27.782 --> 07:36.333
You were going to say once, by the way, that anybody who wrote poetry at the, just to admit that you wrote poetry at the Citadel is to almost, is the equivalent of saying your game.

07:36.353 --> 07:38.075
Oh, I mean, I was a writer.

07:38.095 --> 07:44.843
I remember the, I had, someone remind me, this guy played baseball at the Citadel.

07:44.863 --> 07:50.471
We were, we had played West Virginia, we were riding through the mountains, we were going to play VMI the next day.

07:50.491 --> 07:52.433
So we were traveling at night in the stationery.

07:53.780 --> 08:02.932
I had a great baseball coach named Chow Port, who later went into South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.

08:04.354 --> 08:07.237
He was asking all the players what they were going to do when they graduated.

08:07.257 --> 08:11.923
And Conroy said he was going to be a lawyer, and Holly Keller was going to take over his father's pianist.

08:11.943 --> 08:14.286
He came to me and he said, Conroy, what are you going to be?

08:14.306 --> 08:15.147
I said, I'm going to be a writer.

08:15.948 --> 08:18.852
And the station wagon exploded in his laughter.

08:18.912 --> 08:20.815
I just roared with laughter.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.537
He said, come on, Conroy, you've got to make a goddamn living.

08:22.557 --> 08:23.398
What are you going to be?

08:24.003 --> 08:26.046
I said, I'm going to be a writer.

08:26.066 --> 08:27.888
And they roared again.

08:27.928 --> 08:39.483
So my assessment always takes in what I came from and the fact that I did not know quite how to go about it.

08:40.163 --> 08:42.547
I did not know anybody who did it.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.892
I had no examples except people I read about or books I read.

08:47.813 --> 08:51.318
And so with that, I'm sort of amazed.

08:51.358 --> 08:53.200
I'm astonished that this has worked.

08:53.787 --> 08:56.050
in whatever way it's worked.

08:56.070 --> 09:02.397
Excuse me, did you want to see it back?

09:02.417 --> 09:08.784
You're talking about, of course, you start always wanting to be a writer.

09:08.804 --> 09:09.725
And you become a writer.

09:09.745 --> 09:15.131
I guess I'm still kind of looking for, you know, do you have an evaluation of your work?

09:15.151 --> 09:16.612
Do you see your work as a corpus?

09:17.573 --> 09:20.757
Yeah, it seems like there is a,

09:21.462 --> 09:23.344
I think in your case... A single voice.

09:23.605 --> 09:27.409
In your case, it really is a quietness.

09:28.391 --> 09:34.138
Whether or not it's strictly autobiographical or not, we certainly are seeing aspects of your life in all of your books.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.262
Yeah, I always love my family.

09:37.342 --> 09:38.884
My brothers will tease me.

09:38.904 --> 09:50.338
They'll say, you know, we may not know how members of the family will appear, the various guises that we'll put them in, but we always know that the hero...

09:50.977 --> 10:03.354
will be a fabulous, sensitive, wonderful, caring, inhumane individual that Pat modestly bases on himself.

10:03.975 --> 10:08.140
They're always teasing the hell out of me with that.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.082
Well, have you had trouble?

10:09.102 --> 10:10.423
Do you think it is one voice?

10:11.365 --> 10:18.975
I think there is a—that voice is—certainly that narrated voice has come from within me somewhere.

10:19.175 --> 10:21.957
What I get confused about is, you know, is that me?

10:21.977 --> 10:23.299
Is that autobiographical?

10:23.379 --> 10:25.641
Or is that the writer's voice?

10:25.701 --> 10:26.762
It's a mystery to everybody.

10:26.882 --> 10:27.542
I don't know.

10:27.562 --> 10:29.124
You probably don't even stop to think about it.

10:29.184 --> 10:30.285
I have not thought about it much.

10:30.685 --> 10:35.569
Except, now, this particular book, the new one, you did write in the third person, right?

10:36.550 --> 10:37.311
Nan told me to.

10:37.791 --> 10:38.332
Was it hard?

10:38.992 --> 10:39.593
I enjoyed it.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.416
Then why did she suggest changing it back?

10:44.137 --> 10:47.680
You know, I never asked her, but I thought she was right when she said it.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.964
Yeah, it just seemed, you know, it seemed correct.

10:51.425 --> 10:54.209
I was glad for the discipline of doing it, third person.

10:54.329 --> 10:54.870
I liked that.

10:56.532 --> 11:02.942
There were scenes I probably would have had a great deal of trouble writing in the first person, but because I did it in the third, I didn't even think about it.

11:03.723 --> 11:05.365
You know, it's interesting.

11:05.405 --> 11:09.451
This woman, Mary Carr, did she try to write this particular memoir?

11:09.591 --> 11:10.292
Have you ever heard her?

11:10.352 --> 11:10.933
Yeah, Monday.

11:11.386 --> 11:12.748
I think it was just two days ago.

11:12.848 --> 11:13.869
Is she around here?

11:13.950 --> 11:19.377
She's actually going on, she's going to be out in the Hamptons this weekend, giving a talk.

11:19.397 --> 11:20.358
Is that right?

11:20.438 --> 11:22.181
Guildhall in East Hampton.

11:22.201 --> 11:23.342
I have to know that.

11:23.362 --> 11:25.265
She placed the story in the Hamptons magazine.

11:26.226 --> 11:27.728
I wrote it fast yesterday.

11:27.748 --> 11:30.693
I thought you must have... I wrote it yesterday.

11:30.853 --> 11:33.857
I had a regular column on Bill Moyers this week, too.

11:35.219 --> 11:39.064
Anyway, she said she originally tried to write this as an author.

11:40.141 --> 11:42.323
And I said, well, what happened?

11:42.343 --> 11:45.807
She said, I found that, how did she say it?

11:45.827 --> 11:48.029
She said, I was too nice to myself in fiction.

11:49.150 --> 11:50.631
I lied more about myself.

11:50.732 --> 11:53.094
I made myself better than I was in real life.

11:53.114 --> 11:54.716
And she found just the opposite.

11:54.896 --> 12:00.822
I mean, she found that when she started to write it as a memoir, she had to tell the truth.

12:01.202 --> 12:03.464
You know, I mean, it's interesting.

12:03.504 --> 12:06.267
It's an interesting term where the fictional form,

12:07.141 --> 12:09.924
actually, she found that she was kind of covering up a little bit.

12:10.084 --> 12:14.028
Well, you were just the opposite, I guess, is what I'm driving at.

12:14.048 --> 12:14.549
Too bad.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.031
That's fine.

12:19.754 --> 12:20.395
Let me chew.

12:20.876 --> 12:21.576
Go ahead, please.

12:21.636 --> 12:25.461
Why don't we just... Okay.

12:28.143 --> 12:29.625
You just asked me an interesting question.

12:29.685 --> 12:30.746
Yeah, what was it?

12:31.207 --> 12:36.152
It was... She says she can...

12:36.436 --> 12:38.658
Tell more truth in non-fiction.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.561
Here's what I think.

12:45.646 --> 12:56.057
I think if I was writing about my father in a non-fiction way, I never could have written about him as truthfully as I did in The Great Santee.

12:56.357 --> 12:58.199
Fiction is where I go to tell the truth.

12:58.399 --> 12:59.721
Good answer.

12:59.741 --> 13:00.522
Great.

13:00.542 --> 13:00.942
I love that.

13:02.018 --> 13:04.701
Fiction is the place that I think truth could be.

13:04.962 --> 13:09.127
The things that can be told that I cannot tell you, I can tell in fiction.

13:09.147 --> 13:10.008
It's just easier?

13:10.668 --> 13:18.898
It seems to me that the place where you tell the darkest secrets is fiction.

13:18.918 --> 13:22.282
The place where I go to lie is not fiction.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.524
It's the same thing this woman said.

13:24.145 --> 13:25.566
I just can't help it.

13:25.586 --> 13:26.227
Isn't that something?

13:26.287 --> 13:26.948
I just can't help it.

13:26.968 --> 13:29.511
She found that trying to write this.

13:30.048 --> 13:31.050
Well, it was the other way around.

13:31.150 --> 13:32.171
It was the other way around for her.

13:32.392 --> 13:37.580
See, I have the totally opposite, when she said that, I have the totally opposite approach.

13:37.760 --> 13:47.134
Okay, that's a terrific, you know, you said once, you've said to me and to others that your father's violence is the central fact of your art and life.

13:47.254 --> 13:50.079
Do you still believe that to be the case?

13:50.099 --> 13:58.131
Yeah, I have, the thing with Dad, I've even told Dad this, I said, Dad, my big surprise is because you're violent is that

13:58.600 --> 14:05.049
Even though I did not beat my children or my wives or my friends, there's something about me that's a violent man.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.292
It comes out of my books.

14:07.752 --> 14:09.074
There's violence in all my books.

14:09.234 --> 14:24.675
I think it came out in the... I could say something to one of my kids, hey, I could do... There's something that my kids were terrified of, that I know my wives were terrified of.

14:26.393 --> 14:27.454
Because I was a large man.

14:27.474 --> 14:28.295
I went to the synagogue.

14:28.315 --> 14:29.196
I was raised by a Marine.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.017
I could scare a child.

14:31.037 --> 14:31.738
I could scare a woman.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.080
I didn't even realize it for years and years.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.762
I just could do it.

14:36.463 --> 14:38.665
I could scare my men friends.

14:40.566 --> 14:41.848
What?

14:42.028 --> 14:45.631
This was a gift my father had passed on.

14:45.711 --> 14:46.732
It's also in the gene pool.

14:46.872 --> 14:49.154
A gift and a... And a curse.

14:49.335 --> 14:50.896
A terrible curse.

14:50.996 --> 14:52.618
It horrified me when I realized this.

14:53.118 --> 14:55.000
I'm trying now.

14:56.380 --> 15:00.185
You know, I have certainly dealt with Dad in the way he was.

15:01.446 --> 15:05.591
As openly as anybody ever, you know, I have held my father accountable.

15:05.731 --> 15:12.279
There is, you know, no one ever reads me, has any doubt that I was knocked around when I was a kid.

15:12.299 --> 15:13.921
I bet your father still denies it.

15:13.941 --> 15:14.642
Still denies it.

15:14.662 --> 15:15.903
And your brothers validate it.

15:16.084 --> 15:18.747
I guess the girls don't.

15:18.927 --> 15:19.688
And the girls don't.

15:20.056 --> 15:20.697
And who knows?

15:20.717 --> 15:22.599
But, you know, I know what, you know, what happened.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.242
I have no worry about that.

15:24.262 --> 15:31.892
What I've been trying to concentrate on recently is that my father and mother gave me great gifts also.

15:33.434 --> 15:39.142
My parents, my brother Mike is working at a bar for 20 years.

15:39.542 --> 15:42.286
Yesterday, he's in Columbia, South Carolina.

15:42.306 --> 15:45.510
And I went to lunch with my brother there.

15:45.530 --> 15:46.732
And the owner of the bar came by.

15:47.012 --> 15:47.974
He was talking about Mike.

15:47.994 --> 15:48.915
And he said...

15:50.178 --> 15:55.824
He said, anytime there's a big holiday, and my partners and I would say, we've got to get a Conroy to work at the bar.

15:55.844 --> 15:56.365
A Conroy.

15:57.146 --> 15:59.768
And all my brothers have worked there.

15:59.788 --> 15:59.949
Wow.

16:00.029 --> 16:01.610
And we've got to find a Conroy to work there.

16:01.630 --> 16:02.031
I said, why?

16:02.211 --> 16:05.715
He said, because your family's completely honest.

16:07.597 --> 16:14.584
And he said, when you're at a restaurant, when you're at a bar, and you know who you can trust.

16:14.604 --> 16:17.167
He said, you don't know this about your brother Mike.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.108
Mike, I was eating with him.

16:18.128 --> 16:19.830
He said, your brother Mike's from work here 20 years ago.

16:20.232 --> 16:29.264
He said, after he worked here about 10 years, he said, I told him, Mike, if your family ever comes in, friends ever come in, you can give him a free drink anytime you want.

16:30.766 --> 16:31.267
You've earned that.

16:31.708 --> 16:32.609
So Mike said, thanks.

16:32.689 --> 16:36.494
He says, Pat, he's never given anyone a free drink, including you.

16:37.516 --> 16:39.098
He's never used it once.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.265
When you said, I want to have a Conway here, I thought it was because they're tough.

16:44.785 --> 16:46.607
Well, there's probably that, too.

16:47.387 --> 16:51.952
But what he meant was he did not ever have to worry about steel.

16:51.972 --> 17:02.141
Which was the Greek and the world's famous restaurant owners will tell you, is that the difference between a restaurant that survives and a restaurant that fails is how much you can control theft by the hell.

17:02.502 --> 17:02.982
Is that right?

17:03.122 --> 17:05.204
Yes, because the margins are so tight.

17:05.725 --> 17:09.768
Well, he just, I mean, he just, you know, it was one of the things that I realized that my father was an honest man.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.531
He...

17:13.068 --> 17:15.130
instilled in us a great sense of ethics.

17:15.831 --> 17:17.512
We have a great sense of right and wrong.

17:18.954 --> 17:26.201
I'm trying to give him credit for this and give mom credit for this now, that these were things I did not concentrate on, but certainly I should have.

17:26.421 --> 17:33.288
I certainly should have, you know, there was a great sense of duty, of discipline.

17:34.229 --> 17:38.493
So without question, then, that question remains in the affirmative.

17:38.513 --> 17:39.514
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:39.764 --> 17:44.191
You know, I interviewed, and I don't mean to throw these other quotes back, but it is interesting what other writers say.

17:44.792 --> 17:49.120
I did an interview with Nadine Gortimer when she was up at Harvard last fall for these lectures.

17:49.841 --> 17:51.744
Okay, she's written God knows how many books.

17:51.764 --> 17:52.625
A million books.

17:52.846 --> 18:00.118
But she said everyone, she compared each book, and she said it's like walking into a room, and there's one statue there.

18:00.338 --> 18:05.767
And she said, for me, every book is like walking around and seeing different parts of the same statue.

18:05.787 --> 18:06.328
Oh, great, thanks.

18:07.102 --> 18:12.968
He said, I try to make every book different, but basically I'm telling the same story.

18:13.068 --> 18:22.757
I guess this goes back to my earlier question about looking at your work as a body of work as if it's all different views of the same statue.

18:23.377 --> 18:24.478
I'm sure it is.

18:25.159 --> 18:27.081
Can you relate to that observation?

18:27.261 --> 18:34.628
Yeah, and I seem to be trying to explain the world to myself as I go through it.

18:35.806 --> 18:41.755
And I seem to be trying desperately to explain what this world is like to me as I travel through it.

18:43.037 --> 18:45.301
So that's the primary force in your fiction?

18:45.401 --> 18:45.841
I think so.

18:46.663 --> 18:52.552
And the only way, apparently, that you can do it, then, is to, the only way you can explain your world is to write about your own world.

18:53.113 --> 18:59.522
I'm sure people ask, has it ever occurred to you that it's impossible for you to write about a world that you don't know, people that you don't know?

18:59.683 --> 19:03.248
Here's what, it's impossible for me to write people I don't know, certainly.

19:04.342 --> 19:09.810
What is impossible is I must feel their emotion if I write about them.

19:09.830 --> 19:17.881
If I cannot feel their story, if I cannot feel their agony, if I cannot feel what they have gone through, then it is of no interest to me.

19:18.481 --> 19:21.586
That's especially important in the new book we're writing about the Holocaust.

19:21.606 --> 19:22.667
No question, no question.

19:22.687 --> 19:24.410
And that was agony.

19:25.091 --> 19:28.215
That one moved through my bloodstream.

19:28.255 --> 19:30.117
That one affected me a great deal.

19:30.398 --> 19:32.020
And what moved you to...

19:32.337 --> 19:40.148
As an Irish Catholic, I tried to presume, Southerner, to presume that you could do this.

19:40.168 --> 19:50.223
Well, it was, I once, when I was in the middle of this book, I'd been interviewing survivors of the Holocaust and their children in Atlanta, Georgia.

19:50.283 --> 19:52.205
I hired a researcher to interview others.

19:53.247 --> 20:01.078
And I spoke, and this was in the 1980s, I spoke to the children of Holocaust survivors in Atlanta, and about 50 of them.

20:01.733 --> 20:08.361
And we met in this room in the Jewish Community Center, and I said, I want to ask you all a question.

20:09.262 --> 20:11.886
How can I write this book without you all hating my guts?

20:14.449 --> 20:16.111
And it was a fascinating discussion.

20:16.892 --> 20:18.414
Some of them said, you shouldn't write this book.

20:18.474 --> 20:19.055
You're not Jewish.

20:19.075 --> 20:22.499
You don't understand it.

20:22.519 --> 20:23.120
Can I just interrupt?

20:23.160 --> 20:30.289
You were fearful that they would hate your guts because you don't share the... First of all, I'm not Jewish.

20:31.400 --> 20:40.753
I noticed people are understandably sensitive about other people, you know, roaring in to their stories.

20:41.975 --> 20:47.262
I'd watch what happened to William Styron with Sophie's Choice.

20:47.282 --> 20:48.584
I read a lot.

20:48.604 --> 20:51.428
I saw Styron calling any Semites all over the place.

20:52.589 --> 20:55.053
It's not Philip Roth calling it, Andy.

20:55.093 --> 20:58.698
Yeah, Philip Roth calling it.

20:58.718 --> 20:59.719
It just was...

21:00.661 --> 21:04.985
And I know the Holocaust, you know, you go there at your own peril.

21:05.505 --> 21:06.306
Indeed.

21:06.326 --> 21:06.846
And I knew this.

21:08.468 --> 21:17.556
So I told them that, you know, I didn't write this, that it's bad for a writer to ask permission to write sometimes.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.037
I always thought that was not it.

21:19.598 --> 21:22.841
And the story is going to tell that I had felt.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.643
Well, you really depred me, but you really didn't ask their permission.

21:25.923 --> 21:26.424
No, no.

21:26.484 --> 21:27.865
Because you were going to do it.

21:27.885 --> 21:28.626
No, I was going to do it.

21:28.666 --> 21:29.286
I told them that.

21:29.386 --> 21:30.027
I told them that.

21:30.412 --> 21:38.285
And I said, the role that's always been interesting to me is the child of the survivor.

21:38.825 --> 21:46.337
Because the thing I kept coming across was kids growing up in America, and here they were, and their parents went through the worst thing imaginable.

21:46.357 --> 21:53.509
And over and over again during these interviews, I'd come across kids, you know, they'd do something wrong, and their mother would say, you're worse than Hitler.

21:54.030 --> 21:55.953
This little kid, poor little kid.

21:56.574 --> 21:58.056
And I went to Auschwitz for this.

21:58.846 --> 22:03.852
And there was this thing, and I thought, what an incredible burden these children had.

22:04.833 --> 22:08.338
And, you know, as their parents, and here they were trying to be just American children.

22:08.798 --> 22:10.060
And I watched as I was growing up.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.344
I had known some Holocaust, the children of Holocaust survivors.

22:14.465 --> 22:19.611
And I just watched them, and I had known of one woman who had committed suicide.

22:21.314 --> 22:24.998
And the thing that her parents had said, we will never go through anything worse.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.262
And you can't say that, like, you can't challenge life like that.

22:29.103 --> 22:32.928
Because what was worse was their child killing herself.

22:33.588 --> 22:40.697
And it was not the Germans, the Nazis that killed her, it was their child killing her because of unhappiness she could not control.

22:41.878 --> 22:47.625
The theme of suicide, it's something you don't want to talk about.

22:47.885 --> 22:52.731
No, I'll be glad to.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.503
heartbreaking that it has actually touched your life.

22:56.584 --> 23:01.970
Even after you started this book, it begins literally on the opening page.

23:01.990 --> 23:12.904
We had, of the seven children of my mother and father in this family, I think there have been five suicide attempts, one successful.

23:14.045 --> 23:19.252
And five of us... You're talking about an oxymoron assessment.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.293
Yeah, yeah.

23:21.054 --> 23:22.836
One that worked.

23:23.373 --> 23:34.968
It is, you know, but there has been great raging depression in this family, great anxiety in this family.

23:34.988 --> 23:38.052
I mean, there's been a lot that has gone on in this family.

23:38.072 --> 23:43.459
Does it help you deal with it as an individual by writing about it?

23:43.539 --> 23:52.350
Well, the worst thing in this case is I had a, I went to a hideous depression in 1993, the end of 1993.

23:53.039 --> 23:58.366
where I went through about my second or third suicidal episode.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.132
It's fairly common with me.

24:03.152 --> 24:07.037
I now have learned to, okay, here it is again.

24:07.077 --> 24:08.759
Oh, great.

24:08.920 --> 24:09.600
It's back here.

24:10.982 --> 24:11.984
But this was the worst.

24:12.064 --> 24:14.967
I had my worst one.

24:15.008 --> 24:16.429
You actually schemed away?

24:16.489 --> 24:18.051
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:18.071 --> 24:21.596
Thinking of how physically you carry it out and stuff like that?

24:21.616 --> 24:22.337
It is...

24:23.330 --> 24:29.619
You know, I think if I thought of a gun, but then, you know, then that's, you know, somebody has to find you.

24:29.639 --> 24:31.181
That seems bad.

24:31.442 --> 24:35.307
I always like these things of the sea, letting the sea take you.

24:36.189 --> 24:38.772
This has always had great appeal to me.

24:38.792 --> 24:45.142
But then, and I also was writing the book about my brother who's schizophrenic, my youngest brother, Tom.

24:46.003 --> 24:51.531
I called him John Harden in the book and was writing it and was very worried about him reading this.

24:52.152 --> 24:54.376
Because he read everything, yeah.

24:54.396 --> 25:00.586
And he would... As a finished book, you mean?

25:00.606 --> 25:00.946
Yeah.

25:00.966 --> 25:01.888
Not as a manuscript.

25:01.908 --> 25:02.128
Yeah.

25:02.148 --> 25:03.451
I was hiding this from him.

25:03.471 --> 25:04.212
I was not telling him.

25:04.232 --> 25:07.978
I was trying to figure out how to approach it with him.

25:07.998 --> 25:09.661
The entire family had gone through a lot this time.

25:09.821 --> 25:15.571
But clearly he was the individual who was energizing... No question.

25:15.811 --> 25:16.332
No question.

25:16.352 --> 25:18.936
No question.

25:19.642 --> 25:26.750
Even though I had made up incidents with John Harden, I had made up dialogue that Tom had done.

25:27.370 --> 25:32.636
It was not a big leap for anybody in the family to know who I was writing.

25:32.656 --> 25:38.462
And I had had him in the book kill himself.

25:40.584 --> 25:43.627
And so when my brother called to see it, it happened.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.851
As I called man, I said, man, I can't take this.

25:46.991 --> 25:48.012
I cannot...

25:49.072 --> 25:51.375
I've got to change this.

25:51.395 --> 25:53.798
And she said, whatever you do, it'll be great for the book.

25:53.818 --> 25:54.318
Don't worry.

25:55.139 --> 25:56.581
And Double Lee was wonderful.

25:56.901 --> 26:03.289
Steve Rubin, you know, wrote down, take your time, don't worry, you know.

26:03.309 --> 26:05.952
But my greatest concern... You are the franchise, by the way.

26:06.032 --> 26:11.779
But my greatest concern was this, you know, I had to change that.

26:11.799 --> 26:13.902
So I brought him back from the dead.

26:13.922 --> 26:18.387
I just, okay, threw that chapter out and just said, okay, he's back.

26:19.497 --> 26:21.420
Writing about it, is it therapeutic for you?

26:21.440 --> 26:26.087
I mean, you told me about third major breakdown, near breakdown, depression.

26:26.488 --> 26:28.691
I don't know whether it's therapeutic.

26:28.711 --> 26:32.156
It does not seem... It's something you have to do, however, on the other hand.

26:32.176 --> 26:42.833
It just seems like in this explaining life as I have lived in life to myself, I have to put in this, you know, there are times when people come to their limits.

26:42.873 --> 26:45.677
There are times when people come to sadness they cannot bear.

26:46.098 --> 26:46.939
It seems to me...

26:47.273 --> 26:51.898
Putting that in reflects the truth of life as I have seen it, and I have lived it.

26:53.219 --> 26:54.020
What do you see now?

26:54.040 --> 27:00.587
Again, to go back to, I think, the first question as you approach the 50th birthday, where do you see the work going?

27:00.607 --> 27:03.651
Here's the thing about 50, I think, I thought, holy Christ, 50.

27:04.151 --> 27:06.474
Okay, you know, you've lived your first 50 years.

27:06.514 --> 27:09.177
Remember when 50 seems impossibly old?

27:09.317 --> 27:12.060
Oh, amazing.

27:12.140 --> 27:12.440
Okay.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.281
When the kids, guys go.

27:13.767 --> 27:18.352
Yeah, I mean, at 50, I said, holy Christ, my hair has changed color, Jesus Christ.

27:19.433 --> 27:23.857
And I can't imagine a little bit of that.

27:24.838 --> 27:27.381
So I think, how many books can I write between now and time?

27:28.202 --> 27:29.283
I go to see Jesus.

27:29.703 --> 27:31.165
How many are in there?

27:32.306 --> 27:37.191
And so for the first time, there's a finite number of books in a lifetime.

27:37.211 --> 27:39.133
I don't think I've ever realized that before.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.992
And I want to write them a little bit quicker.

27:42.012 --> 27:43.555
This one took me a little too long.

27:43.715 --> 27:45.419
This one probably took the longest time.

27:45.439 --> 27:46.681
Yeah, it did.

27:46.761 --> 27:48.204
There were distractions, at least.

27:48.224 --> 27:49.867
A lot of distractions, a lot of distractions.

27:50.168 --> 27:54.856
But you don't have to get into, which I write about elsewhere.

27:54.876 --> 28:00.186
But I really hope that I can start writing these books a little more quickly.

28:00.206 --> 28:01.088
You said that the last time.

28:01.642 --> 28:04.666
You said that the last time we read that in 1987.

28:04.686 --> 28:05.568
I know, I know.

28:05.808 --> 28:07.310
But Robert Stone said that, too.

28:07.511 --> 28:07.811
Did he?

28:08.091 --> 28:09.353
Yeah, he said, I'm going to try and start.

28:09.433 --> 28:10.054
How's he doing?

28:10.074 --> 28:10.835
Is he writing quicker?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.499
Well, that last book, Go to Bridge Reach, I thought was terrific.

28:13.559 --> 28:14.561
I loved that book.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.043
I like that guy's writing.

28:16.183 --> 28:19.027
Yeah, he's terrific.

28:19.047 --> 28:20.850
And that was kind of his Moby Dick book.

28:20.870 --> 28:22.092
Does he live near you?

28:22.172 --> 28:22.793
Is he around?

28:22.813 --> 28:23.494
He's in Connecticut.

28:23.514 --> 28:26.618
And actually, I am in New London, so he must read my stories.

28:27.359 --> 28:30.484
I have to say, this is not a good take, but when I go anywhere here,

28:30.802 --> 28:31.823
Okay.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.807
Where's Toby live?

28:35.827 --> 28:36.688
He lives in Syracuse.

28:38.070 --> 28:40.973
In fact, this woman, Mary Carr, lives in Syracuse.

28:40.993 --> 28:41.693
She knows him.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.177
And I told her, I said, I think that I'm going to write this.

28:45.277 --> 28:48.881
I think these are the two best memoirs of childhood.

28:49.161 --> 28:49.862
This Boy's Life?

28:50.162 --> 28:57.670
This Boy's Life and her book, of that early, early childhood and living with, you know, an odd mother and a father.

28:58.342 --> 29:01.807
And where memory is the prism.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.510
You don't go to the documents.

29:03.530 --> 29:06.835
You don't have to check the actual dates from the newspapers.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.978
What you remember is what's important.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.320
And even if it's off a little bit.

29:10.801 --> 29:12.043
I think that's right.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.368
And that's what he said about his Vietnam book.

29:15.568 --> 29:16.470
He didn't keep a journal.

29:17.511 --> 29:20.255
He said, no, I remembered what was important.

29:20.316 --> 29:23.701
He said, the stuff that I remembered is the stuff that's important.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.243
I want to tell you what I was amazed at.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.528
that he and his brother had these two different downloads, and they were both unbelievable.

29:31.789 --> 29:33.651
Did you see the PW piece I did on him?

29:34.332 --> 29:34.993
No, no.

29:35.454 --> 29:36.335
I should send it to you.

29:36.355 --> 29:38.038
It was a pretty good piece.

29:38.058 --> 29:39.921
There's PW interviews now, too.

29:39.941 --> 29:41.042
Is that right?

29:41.062 --> 29:42.304
You know, those interviews and publishers?

29:42.344 --> 29:44.768
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:44.788 --> 29:45.148
Anyway.

29:45.769 --> 29:47.091
That's so funny.

29:47.592 --> 29:49.294
I guess this is kind of a throwaway question.

29:49.314 --> 29:51.177
Have you discovered what's important in life?

29:51.197 --> 29:55.163
You already told me that, I think, unless you want to say anything more about it.

29:55.514 --> 30:09.312
When your mother was dying in 1984, and she did say to you, this one's about me, and this was, of course, this next book was about, she knew it, didn't she?

30:09.332 --> 30:09.893
Yeah, she did.

30:10.233 --> 30:20.186
I mean, there was, you know, Mom had the idea that Dad was by far the second best character I had to write about.

30:20.787 --> 30:22.990
No, there's no question.

30:24.472 --> 30:31.759
She thought Dad was strong but shallow, you know, mean but uninteresting.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.941
But she told you you were a lousy writer.

30:33.961 --> 30:35.202
Told me I was a shitty writer.

30:35.242 --> 30:41.949
Yeah, you said that, you know, you did not know, you did not understand who the real power of that household was.

30:42.009 --> 30:46.373
You did not understand that I was the one that ran that house, not your father.

30:46.393 --> 30:49.996
That he had his fists, but he did not know how to reign.

30:50.337 --> 30:53.820
I mean, she was...

30:54.492 --> 30:59.939
You've described this book as, or somebody has described it as Jack as a man on the run from his past.

31:00.680 --> 31:01.662
Is that a fair assessment?

31:01.682 --> 31:02.703
Yeah, I think it is.

31:03.004 --> 31:04.726
Does that describe you?

31:04.746 --> 31:05.427
I think it does.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.350
I think there has been something about me.

31:07.370 --> 31:09.973
There's been something restless about me my entire life.

31:10.814 --> 31:20.247
There's been something, there's been something, there's been too much movement, too much, not enough stillness in my life.

31:20.908 --> 31:21.729
I'd like to get more.

31:23.732 --> 31:23.892
Um,

31:25.188 --> 31:35.138
And you've also said before how difficult it is for you to express, you said you can easily express love to people, but you still have a very difficult time.

31:36.340 --> 31:46.190
Feeling it, is that... Yeah, I think the hardest thing in America right now for all of us is to feel anything.

31:47.691 --> 31:50.454
In other words, I watch these talk shows sometimes.

31:50.735 --> 31:51.936
I'm stunned.

31:51.956 --> 31:54.098
And I think what it is is a desperate...

31:54.263 --> 31:58.068
desperate attempt of somebody to connect with other people.

31:58.089 --> 32:02.375
And to feel anything seems like a gift in America.

32:02.775 --> 32:04.578
We have so much thrown at us.

32:04.718 --> 32:06.521
There is so much event.

32:06.541 --> 32:12.569
There is so much horror that we see every single day that we have blocked it out so much.

32:12.649 --> 32:14.853
I think it's hard for all of us to feel a single thing.

32:15.373 --> 32:16.896
Is it the malaise of our times?

32:16.976 --> 32:18.698
Are we no longer an innocent nation?

32:19.139 --> 32:19.620
I don't know.

32:19.700 --> 32:20.621
I don't know what it is.

32:20.781 --> 32:22.043
I just...

32:22.985 --> 32:28.134
I just know that people seem surprised if they can feel anything at all.

32:28.154 --> 32:43.880
Do you find that there was some concern, certainly, by people who don't know you and maybe didn't have the confidence in your ability to bring it, as they say in the, anymore, you know, baseball, to bring the fastball, and it took, what, nine years.

32:44.201 --> 32:47.406
Did you ever have any anxiety about that maybe you couldn't?

32:47.825 --> 32:49.107
do this anymore?

32:49.227 --> 32:50.490
Or was it the distractions?

32:50.650 --> 32:54.176
The anxiety I had was that I never knew I'd be following a success.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.321
That was a great surprise to me.

32:57.382 --> 32:58.564
I thought I'd write these books.

32:58.584 --> 32:59.545
An overwhelming success.

32:59.585 --> 33:00.787
Yeah, that just shocked me.

33:00.908 --> 33:01.829
I mean, I did not know.

33:02.010 --> 33:04.614
I would read about it.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.417
I would read about people that happened to, like Irvin.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.043
And it's sort of magical.

33:10.104 --> 33:11.246
You don't know how that's going to happen.

33:11.266 --> 33:12.668
You don't know where that's going to come from.

33:13.660 --> 33:14.681
And I just watched it.

33:14.721 --> 33:16.843
It never occurred to me that would happen to me.

33:17.143 --> 33:18.965
You never expected that from Princess?

33:18.985 --> 33:19.966
You just never did.

33:21.268 --> 33:24.891
You know, that was coming out of the same river the other books had come out of.

33:24.911 --> 33:30.216
And I figured it would have the same... It seemed to me there was a nice art to my career.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.939
They still wanted to publish them.

33:33.019 --> 33:33.960
The movies were still done.

33:33.980 --> 33:34.921
I said, this is very nice.

33:34.961 --> 33:39.446
The movies kept me from having to teach in college.

33:40.707 --> 33:40.967
Um...

33:41.403 --> 33:44.327
So it seemed to me I was leading a very lucky life.

33:44.347 --> 33:48.071
I was in the middle of a lucky life when the Prince of Times took off.

33:48.892 --> 33:54.159
And I did not, and Nan said something that, I did not write for a year after Nan told me this.

33:55.060 --> 34:00.227
She said, now you know what my husband Gates at least goes to, to sit down and write a book worth a million dollars.

34:01.809 --> 34:04.152
And I had never assigned a book.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.034
And he went through it.

34:06.054 --> 34:06.695
He went through it, yeah.

34:07.396 --> 34:10.680
And it never occurred to me a book I was writing was worth anything.

34:10.700 --> 34:10.920
She did it.

34:11.727 --> 34:15.271
But do you feel that the expectation is now?

34:16.152 --> 34:17.493
Does it hurt your work?

34:17.513 --> 34:18.274
Yeah, I don't know.

34:18.535 --> 34:20.457
And we'll find out with this book.

34:20.997 --> 34:29.827
What I did not want to do was this, was being successful to change the thing that brought me to the writing table, that had brought me to this career in the first place.

34:30.488 --> 34:33.431
That there was passion, you know, when I sat down.

34:34.332 --> 34:38.196
I felt passionate about the subject I was writing about.

34:38.216 --> 34:39.878
I felt emotional that I, uh,

34:40.465 --> 34:42.527
could write things that moved me.

34:42.707 --> 34:46.151
And so, you know, what I found out, if I could move myself, sometimes I could move other people.

34:46.511 --> 35:00.645
What I did not want to do was something cheap, a throwaway, something just to write a book, but something that sprang from the same thing that made me ambitious to be a writer in the first place.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.227
When I saw you at the EBA in L.A.

35:02.287 --> 35:04.189
last year, the book was essentially done, right?

35:04.529 --> 35:06.712
No, no.

35:06.732 --> 35:06.872
Oh, no.

35:06.892 --> 35:08.093
That was a lie.

35:08.292 --> 35:16.225
I said at that luncheon in front of you and in front of Nan, I said, deadline novelist.

35:16.245 --> 35:18.288
And she said, oh, no, no, no, no.

35:18.388 --> 35:20.191
It was actually true.

35:20.972 --> 35:22.334
He's like a deadline.

35:22.615 --> 35:23.857
He's making an 11 a.m.

35:24.237 --> 35:24.698
deadline.

35:24.838 --> 35:27.803
I felt like a fraud.

35:27.843 --> 35:29.546
They shouldn't have put that pressure on me.

35:29.566 --> 35:31.549
At that ABA, I said, yeah, this is...

35:31.883 --> 35:33.605
These people now have nothing to sell.

35:33.845 --> 35:34.246
Who knows?

35:34.266 --> 35:35.067
You know, I sat with a guy.

35:35.087 --> 35:37.249
My book went right in the next ABA, Helios.

35:37.270 --> 35:44.478
But, you know, there was a guy there from AA, William Henry III, that I had a nice chat with, and he knew my work.

35:44.498 --> 35:46.200
This guy drops dead a week, a month later.

35:46.220 --> 35:46.741
He was AA.

35:46.761 --> 35:47.762
Hey, sweet guy.

35:47.782 --> 35:49.624
Who the hell knows what's going to happen, right?

35:50.526 --> 35:52.688
Who the hell can... I met him at that ABA.

35:52.708 --> 35:53.830
I met him at that same lunch.

35:53.850 --> 35:54.450
He whispers.

35:54.470 --> 35:55.171
He whispers.

35:55.411 --> 35:56.913
He was sick, by the way.

35:56.933 --> 36:00.017
When he died about three weeks later, I'm sure it was that lingering...

36:00.689 --> 36:03.232
the moment that he had, he worked himself like that.

36:03.252 --> 36:05.375
He was whispering because he was sick.

36:05.395 --> 36:06.556
Do you remember when he whispered?

36:06.717 --> 36:13.185
He was whispering like that, and he said, I'm sorry, I got a bad call, and I didn't have a feeling that he dropped dead.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.026
He was dead.

36:14.086 --> 36:15.748
He was younger than me.

36:16.109 --> 36:16.609
He was dead.

36:16.850 --> 36:18.231
Two Pulitzer Prizes.

36:18.251 --> 36:19.593
What the fuck good is it going to be?

36:19.613 --> 36:20.474
I was stunned by that.

36:20.494 --> 36:22.176
It killed me because I liked him so much.

36:22.196 --> 36:23.198
He was such a sweet guy.

36:23.218 --> 36:24.079
He was so sweet.

36:24.479 --> 36:25.180
He really was.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.402
That book was good, too.

36:26.422 --> 36:29.025
The book was good.

36:29.866 --> 36:30.967
I got a lot of stuff here.

36:30.987 --> 36:31.528
What do you think?

36:33.950 --> 36:35.552
Is love still a mystery for you?

36:35.572 --> 36:37.434
You know, you and I have covered so much territory.

36:37.794 --> 36:40.517
Your love of food is in here, the research for the book.

36:40.818 --> 36:42.780
You did a lot of research for this book.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.340
I did a ton of research.

36:44.441 --> 36:49.247
You know, the Holocaust, you do not want to, you do not come to that lightly.

36:49.267 --> 36:50.788
You do not research that lightly.

36:51.409 --> 36:55.033
And I got interested in that.

36:56.234 --> 36:59.097
I got, these stories hooked me.

37:00.899 --> 37:04.743
We mentioned earlier we were talking about getting permission from these people.

37:04.803 --> 37:19.340
You weren't asking for permission, and there is a connection to Prince of Tides when your sister Carol actually begged you not to write about to Bay Savannah, and you did anyway.

37:19.620 --> 37:21.743
Have you resolved with the sister, by the way?

37:21.763 --> 37:22.243
Not quite.

37:22.624 --> 37:26.548
Carol and I have, you know, we have diplomatic contacts out now.

37:26.848 --> 37:28.310
But she was pissed.

37:28.410 --> 37:30.012
She came to my brother's funeral.

37:30.413 --> 37:33.536
And it's the first time we've seen each other since my mother's funeral ten years before.

37:34.617 --> 37:37.861
And it's still painful.

37:39.482 --> 37:40.323
Wasn't this a book?

37:40.984 --> 37:43.006
I don't think it was a book.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.148
She quit seeing me at Mom's funeral.

37:45.168 --> 37:46.890
Mom died two years before the book came out.

37:47.351 --> 37:50.134
So it could not have been The Prince of Tides.

37:50.354 --> 37:52.356
I was writing about her in The Prince of Tides.

37:54.338 --> 37:55.740
She had one of these weird shrinks.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.142
There's a kind of shrink that's going on in America.

37:58.544 --> 38:05.793
It suggests that the patient not have anything to do with their families.

38:06.954 --> 38:08.896
That, you know, the family is the toxic family.

38:08.916 --> 38:10.839
I wrote a book about this.

38:10.859 --> 38:11.179
Yeah.

38:11.660 --> 38:13.642
It's a very destructive thing, I think.

38:13.662 --> 38:15.164
And Carol had one of those shrinks.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.527
And they take over these people.

38:17.547 --> 38:17.647
Yeah.

38:18.448 --> 38:23.113
And because the shrinks said that we were bad, you know, she listens.

38:24.275 --> 38:26.718
I don't know when or if that will ever be resolved.

38:27.719 --> 38:27.859
I hope.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.771
What can I say?

38:31.831 --> 38:33.573
Do you have an idea about what the next book is?

38:33.653 --> 38:35.235
Are you giving it some thought?

38:35.255 --> 38:36.417
I want to do an Atlanta novel.

38:37.478 --> 38:38.039
You know what?

38:38.059 --> 38:39.921
You're kind of mad at Atlanta these days.

38:40.562 --> 38:41.483
We have a little anger here.

38:41.844 --> 38:43.126
Yeah, I had that thing with college.

38:43.786 --> 38:44.808
Yeah, which I've heard about.

38:46.230 --> 38:52.618
I was born in Atlanta and lived there much of my adult life.

38:52.898 --> 38:56.783
I've just been watching the city grow.

38:57.657 --> 39:05.727
been taking notes and collecting stories, and I have no idea what form that will take now, but I'll try and, you know, I think that's going to be the next.

39:05.747 --> 39:08.230
You're hoping you can do it within five years or so?

39:08.390 --> 39:09.071
I pray.

39:09.171 --> 39:11.273
I'll probably be seeing you when I'm 60.

39:11.514 --> 39:14.678
Well, I hope we get to see each other before that.

39:14.698 --> 39:18.022
I got plenty of stuff, Pat, if you wanted to... No, keep going.

39:18.062 --> 39:26.492
Let's just... You said also that this started out as a brother's book on one of your interviews.

39:26.512 --> 39:26.652
Mm-hmm.

39:27.509 --> 39:32.094
Yeah, I have these brothers I have found hilarious.

39:32.814 --> 39:37.359
And these brothers are like rocks.

39:37.439 --> 39:42.164
They're very supportive.

39:42.184 --> 39:44.907
I mean, they could not have been nice.

39:44.927 --> 39:46.628
Throughout my career, they could not have been nice.

39:47.309 --> 39:55.137
They buy the books, they read the books, they laugh about the books.

39:55.808 --> 39:58.250
So when I told them I was doing this, they said, this is great.

39:59.011 --> 40:01.453
It's not like my sister cuts me off.

40:01.934 --> 40:03.035
They said, this is wonderful.

40:03.515 --> 40:04.296
Make me say this.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.118
And they go through routines with me.

40:06.138 --> 40:08.520
But we have this thing that I have loved.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.683
We have what the brothers call adventures together.

40:11.703 --> 40:17.929
They will pick a river and canoe down the river.

40:18.209 --> 40:21.772
And honestly, I'm amazed how funny they are.

40:22.573 --> 40:24.735
They are good company.

40:25.222 --> 40:28.867
They are nice-skinned men.

40:29.167 --> 40:33.833
And I realize I've mostly written about sisters and have never written about these guys.

40:34.794 --> 40:40.821
And what I love when I was writing this book is Mike's wife came up to me, Jean, and came up to me and she says, in fact, can I ask you a favor?

40:40.841 --> 40:41.562
I said, certainly.

40:42.243 --> 40:45.347
If you're writing about Mike, will you put me in just a little cameo?

40:45.647 --> 40:46.348
I said, sure, Jean.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.551
And she says, will you do me a great fit?

40:48.571 --> 40:49.132
I said, sure.

40:49.152 --> 40:51.435
She says, can I have huge bosoms?

40:51.895 --> 40:53.257
I've wanted them my entire life.

40:53.277 --> 40:53.457
I said,

40:54.196 --> 40:55.798
I said, they'll be giant, Gene.

40:55.818 --> 40:56.859
That's what you truly want.

40:57.860 --> 40:58.921
She said, thank you so much.

40:58.941 --> 40:59.822
She's a little southern girl.

40:59.882 --> 41:00.783
She said, thank you so much.

41:00.883 --> 41:02.384
And you did it.

41:03.666 --> 41:03.926
Yeah.

41:03.946 --> 41:05.708
Gene, you're huge.

41:05.728 --> 41:07.049
It's a small little thing.

41:07.710 --> 41:11.394
It tickles me now of this thing.

41:11.414 --> 41:16.279
But I wanted, because part of the reason I write is a celebration of these people.

41:17.620 --> 41:20.423
I'm a great admirer of these people.

41:21.044 --> 41:24.748
I feel fortunate to be born and have been brought up with them.

41:25.909 --> 41:31.896
You know, my father and I, you know, my father, he says, son, we're going national this time.

41:32.697 --> 41:35.820
We were getting this vanity fair.

41:36.441 --> 41:38.243
He says, I think we're going national.

41:39.844 --> 41:42.367
Did he still sign his Christmas cards?

41:42.407 --> 41:44.149
The Great Santana, he still signs them.

41:45.023 --> 41:48.467
And in that shoot in the Vanity Fair, I couldn't believe they brought a stylist down.

41:48.487 --> 41:49.808
I mean, I'm looking at this stuff.

41:49.868 --> 41:52.351
I said, Dad, what the shit is it?

41:52.371 --> 41:54.113
And they made me wear these white hats.

41:54.414 --> 41:57.177
I said, Dad, they're making me wear that fucking white hat because I was a Southern.

41:58.358 --> 41:59.139
Wear it, son.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.520
I'm wearing this one.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.142
I said, why are you wearing this hat, Dad?

42:02.242 --> 42:04.765
He says, I made a deal with a photographer.

42:05.486 --> 42:07.268
I get to keep both hats, son.

42:08.463 --> 42:10.345
Then he wore suspenders.

42:10.365 --> 42:11.546
I said, he doesn't wear suspenders.

42:11.586 --> 42:13.969
You know, I said, I get to keep all the suspenders.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.331
Like Michael Jordan's father wearing all that stuff.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.534
He's not working his own deals if they can.

42:18.554 --> 42:19.915
Exactly, exactly.

42:19.935 --> 42:21.917
You know, I said, Dad, this is embarrassing.

42:24.800 --> 42:33.289
I love that line when Santini, the Oscar nominations came up and he called and said, I guess he was assuming that he got

42:33.573 --> 42:38.298
He said, son, you and I got nominated for Academy Award last night.

42:38.318 --> 42:39.239
You might have didn't get shit.

42:39.259 --> 42:40.000
You might have got nothing.

42:43.223 --> 42:44.664
All right, let's take a look at the notes here.

42:44.684 --> 42:48.428
I think we've got lots of stuff here, lots of good stuff.

42:48.448 --> 42:49.870
I haven't really questioned you about the book.

42:49.910 --> 42:50.951
The book, that's my job.

42:50.991 --> 42:51.611
That's your job.

42:51.691 --> 42:52.472
I mean, never worry about that.

42:52.492 --> 42:53.113
That's my job.

42:53.133 --> 42:54.494
Also, you can call me anytime.

42:54.574 --> 42:57.657
You're going to have to give me an address so I can send you the book.

42:58.418 --> 43:01.021
Just tell me again the significance of beach music.

43:01.041 --> 43:02.162
Was it always beach music?

43:02.885 --> 43:04.627
Beach music, the title?

43:04.808 --> 43:05.749
Yeah, I came out of that title.

43:05.769 --> 43:08.553
It's a, I don't know, did Molly give you the tape?

43:08.613 --> 43:09.214
They got tape?

43:09.334 --> 43:09.474
No.

43:09.615 --> 43:11.597
She got tape so you can hear beach music.

43:11.617 --> 43:15.242
Beach music was a kind of dance.

43:15.863 --> 43:20.670
The shag was the dance on the southeastern coast when I was growing up in South Carolina.

43:21.812 --> 43:23.074
And they had these peers.

43:23.835 --> 43:27.660
And one of the reasons these bands would come, and it was like the first time

43:28.450 --> 43:34.138
The first time that I saw real integration takes place in South Carolina because black bands would come to play for white kids.

43:35.300 --> 43:38.464
And they would have white bands going to play for black kids at colleges.

43:38.505 --> 43:41.589
And what was in common was this kind of music that came out.

43:41.729 --> 43:44.774
The Drifter saved the last dance for me.

43:44.794 --> 43:45.895
I don't know if you remember that.

43:46.236 --> 43:48.078
It was one of my favorite songs in my childhood.

43:48.980 --> 43:51.503
That was a classic beach music song.

43:51.523 --> 43:57.512
And we'll get this tape from her because it was just a thing of...

43:59.146 --> 44:05.954
The whole phrase, beach music, evokes something of that time and that period and that music.

44:09.578 --> 44:12.802
You know, what it is, it's like Bruce Madeline for me.

44:12.842 --> 44:17.427
When I hear this music, it is my childhood coming back to me.

44:18.729 --> 44:24.756
And it did seem to have this resonance for the whole... It seemed something hit with that.

44:25.457 --> 44:27.179
Nan liked it right away.

44:27.219 --> 44:28.360
Nan just, you know, that's it.

44:29.150 --> 44:30.953
She said, don't you?

44:30.973 --> 44:34.980
And she said, I don't want those goddamn kings, queens, and princes.

44:35.180 --> 44:36.162
She said, I'm tired of that.

44:36.943 --> 44:38.706
Them lords, I'm sick of that.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.549
I love the book, by the way.

44:40.569 --> 44:40.849
I love it.

44:40.969 --> 44:41.651
Well, good, good.

44:41.671 --> 44:44.255
If you just like it, I'll be very happy.

44:44.275 --> 44:47.861
Well, I'll be very pleased to share this with four million readers.

44:48.021 --> 44:48.402
Well, good.

44:48.442 --> 44:53.109
This is a, I have, but let's get that thing going.

44:53.129 --> 44:54.111
Can I just take a cup?

44:55.745 --> 44:59.910
This illustration here, right after page 14, that's the Piazza Farnese.

44:59.930 --> 45:01.212
Is that right about?

45:01.232 --> 45:02.914
And, you know, I can see why they did that.

45:03.695 --> 45:05.797
That's my apartment around.

45:05.818 --> 45:06.258
Oh, wow.

45:06.358 --> 45:07.139
Pointing to the top.

45:07.159 --> 45:09.282
Yeah, no one knew it.

45:09.322 --> 45:10.423
This was an accident.

45:10.443 --> 45:11.084
Oh, that's wild.

45:11.304 --> 45:11.885
There's one more.

45:13.447 --> 45:16.090
There's one more that surprised me even more.

45:16.711 --> 45:17.512
Do me a favor.

45:17.532 --> 45:18.754
This is Ellen's book.

45:18.774 --> 45:19.775
It's on my book.

45:20.956 --> 45:22.398
What page do you have?

45:22.478 --> 45:23.119
One page.

45:24.027 --> 45:25.869
What is page 13?

45:25.909 --> 45:27.051
Sorry, part one.

45:27.511 --> 45:28.232
Page 13?

45:28.493 --> 45:28.693
Yeah.

45:28.993 --> 45:31.957
Would you just click, draw an arrow, and say my apartment?

45:32.418 --> 45:32.598
Okay.

45:32.618 --> 45:33.159
I'll figure this.

45:35.201 --> 45:40.107
Just make this kind of... I've never done this.

45:40.188 --> 45:40.888
This is amazing.

45:40.908 --> 45:41.589
This is a good idea.

45:41.790 --> 45:42.531
Oh, it's wonderful.

45:42.551 --> 45:42.951
Are you serious?

45:42.971 --> 45:46.035
You see how I'm making this a distinctive look?

45:51.365 --> 45:52.727
Okay.

45:52.747 --> 45:54.368
But what's the other one?

45:54.408 --> 45:55.950
The other one, just completely.

45:56.010 --> 45:58.373
Let's see what we're doing.

45:58.453 --> 46:00.135
This is the artist thing.

46:00.175 --> 46:05.081
This is Jack McCall's house he grew up in Waterford.

46:05.101 --> 46:05.321
Right.

46:05.361 --> 46:06.742
This is the artist's rendition.

46:07.103 --> 46:10.667
This is 39 Church Street in Charleston, South Carolina.

46:11.228 --> 46:13.931
My best friend in Charleston, a woman I was in love with.

46:13.951 --> 46:15.232
Sally Sinkler lives here.

46:15.252 --> 46:19.377
I can... Let's just say this has a personal... Okay.

46:19.397 --> 46:19.617
No.

46:19.968 --> 46:21.751
I stayed at this house before I got a job.

46:21.771 --> 46:22.252
Like that, man.

46:22.272 --> 46:24.355
Okay, this is, let me show you this.

46:25.236 --> 46:28.040
This is how, this was Sally and Dana Sinker.

46:28.060 --> 46:28.681
That's their house.

46:29.362 --> 46:32.327
This woman just picked out a book on the shop, isn't it?

46:32.347 --> 46:32.808
Isn't that amazing?

46:32.888 --> 46:33.409
That is amazing.

46:33.429 --> 46:34.470
Oh, you can't even do that.

46:35.292 --> 46:42.803
Oh, I love this.

46:49.853 --> 46:51.394
I got a buddy waiting in the house.

46:51.414 --> 46:51.975
He's going to kill me.

46:52.215 --> 46:52.656
That's fine.

46:56.159 --> 46:56.960
That's great fact.

46:57.740 --> 47:05.147
This is 39 Church Street.

47:05.227 --> 47:08.450
Wow.

47:10.833 --> 47:11.834
That's my copy.

47:13.095 --> 47:19.641
This is a... Isn't that amazing?

47:20.701 --> 47:23.866
You just don't know that stuff.

47:23.886 --> 47:25.408
Now, do you want to lay on the floor?

47:25.688 --> 47:27.931
No, I want to do a blurb now.

47:28.132 --> 47:30.815
I want to know who you're trying to get to.

47:31.316 --> 47:34.601
I'm trying to get to people who like good stories, who are interested in writing.

47:34.681 --> 47:44.515
This book is not just for book collectors, I guess, is what we're trying to do.

48:01.403 --> 48:18.562
The book of our books is also a great story of obsession, passion.

48:20.104 --> 48:23.187
Help me, help me.

48:23.288 --> 48:24.349
Obsession, passion.

48:24.469 --> 48:26.331
I mean, there are just dozens of stories.

48:27.003 --> 48:33.031
My model for this was God's Graves and Scholars, which took an arcane subject and made it accessible.

48:33.832 --> 48:46.129
Human nature, I guess, is but... Obsession, obsession... A great deal.

48:46.210 --> 48:53.379
Okay, a great deal of obsession, passion.

48:53.399 --> 48:53.820
Okay...

48:55.707 --> 48:59.070
And a hundred terrific, unforgettable stories.

48:59.090 --> 49:00.651
More than a hundred.

49:00.671 --> 49:00.752
Huh?

49:00.772 --> 49:02.273
There's more than a hundred.

49:02.293 --> 49:02.433
Okay.

49:02.473 --> 49:03.054
And hundreds?

49:03.234 --> 49:03.774
Hundreds.

49:03.794 --> 49:04.075
Okay.

49:04.095 --> 49:05.436
Dozens, scores.

49:05.456 --> 49:06.577
Okay, and hundreds.

49:22.471 --> 49:23.352
Unforgettable stories.

49:30.115 --> 49:31.257
About the love of books.

49:31.898 --> 49:33.740
About the passion for books.

49:33.861 --> 49:34.562
Okay.

49:34.582 --> 49:35.663
Did you say passion already?

49:35.683 --> 49:36.404
Passion, okay.

49:36.605 --> 49:38.147
About the love of books?

49:38.407 --> 49:38.748
Sure.

49:41.893 --> 49:42.994
About the madness for books.

49:43.154 --> 49:44.517
About the madness.

49:44.537 --> 49:45.017
Is that all right?

49:45.238 --> 49:45.398
Yes.

49:45.758 --> 49:50.465
The madness surrounding the requirement of books.

49:51.527 --> 49:52.388
About the madness.

49:54.852 --> 49:55.653
What do we say here?

49:56.174 --> 49:56.655
Okay.

49:57.236 --> 49:58.337
These are just a few.

49:58.397 --> 49:59.599
This book includes a

50:00.524 --> 50:06.672
How is the madness of collecting books?

50:08.315 --> 50:13.862
It's a celebration of books and the people who have gathered and preserved them over the centuries.

50:13.922 --> 50:21.393
It's not just collecting, it's also saving and passing on, and it's respect for the book, it's love for the book.

50:21.413 --> 50:24.517
Not just as objects, but for what they contain, too, I think.

50:24.537 --> 50:25.018
How about this?

50:25.839 --> 50:26.159
A book?

50:26.700 --> 50:27.221
A lot of books.

50:27.241 --> 50:30.345
There's also a great tale of obsession, passion, and hundreds of untold

50:30.680 --> 50:33.503
Unforgettable stories about the madness surrounding the world of books.

50:33.523 --> 50:34.004
Wonderful.

50:34.244 --> 50:34.544
Okay.

50:34.744 --> 50:37.848
Let us sign it so we don't know who's here who wrote it.

50:37.868 --> 50:37.968
Okay.

50:37.988 --> 50:39.369
This.

50:39.389 --> 50:40.190
How about that?

50:40.210 --> 50:40.490
Okay.

50:40.511 --> 50:41.251
You got a phone number?

50:41.271 --> 50:41.431
Yeah.

50:41.512 --> 50:42.953
Where can I send you a finished copy?

50:43.113 --> 50:43.273
Okay.

50:43.293 --> 50:43.454
Here.

50:43.474 --> 50:46.197
I'll be happy to send it to Doubleday anywhere you want.

50:46.657 --> 50:47.518
Send these to Doubleday.

50:47.538 --> 50:48.359
I'm on the road now.

50:48.379 --> 50:48.499
Okay.

50:48.519 --> 50:49.660
I'm not even home.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.701
Do you want that pen?

50:51.322 --> 50:51.542
No.

50:52.043 --> 50:52.964
I did not steal a pen.

50:53.064 --> 50:54.505
No, but it's a nice pen, though.

50:54.525 --> 50:55.607
It's good for them.

50:55.687 --> 50:57.789
I've got to run because my buddy is downstairs.

50:57.969 --> 50:59.691
I'm serious.

51:01.527 --> 51:02.328
Thanks so much.

51:02.348 --> 51:03.930
I would never leave.

51:04.110 --> 51:04.871
You want my card?

51:05.091 --> 51:05.772
Here's my card.

51:05.792 --> 51:06.453
Okay, I got it.

51:06.473 --> 51:09.096
Because who am I going to give this to?

51:09.117 --> 51:09.457
The Greek.

51:09.537 --> 51:10.138
The Greek.

51:10.438 --> 51:17.567
Am I being opportunistic by... You have to show your book.

51:17.807 --> 51:18.729
Welcome to my world.

51:18.769 --> 51:21.933
If I send you a gentle magic here, you'll get it.

51:22.173 --> 51:23.535
Absolutely nothing.

51:23.555 --> 51:24.376
Send it to Marley.

51:24.396 --> 51:24.816
Just make sure.

51:24.876 --> 51:26.158
And enjoy seeing you.

51:26.398 --> 51:27.139
Okay?

51:28.981 --> 51:29.442
Thank you.

51:38.855 --> 51:47.253
Thank you.

51:47.493 --> 51:51.261
I've got to run, OK?

52:09.905 --> 52:34.208
All right.

53:52.100 --> 54:16.555
Oh, my God.

55:27.376 --> 55:37.903
.

55:37.923 --> 55:37.943
.

56:43.128 --> 56:55.264
It's better.

57:18.802 --> 57:23.042
Sorry, we were up to enough that there was a lion too.

57:23.062 --> 57:26.719
And the lion came back.

58:06.811 --> 58:07.996
Thank you.

59:09.367 --> 59:36.657
the the the

59:37.126 --> 59:40.605
... ...

01:01:03.965 --> 01:01:04.863
Oh.
