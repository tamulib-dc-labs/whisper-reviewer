WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:04.631
It's rolling.

00:04.652 --> 00:04.912
508.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.054
Where am I calling?

00:06.495 --> 00:07.117
Massachusetts.

00:07.577 --> 00:08.239
Central Mass.

00:10.764 --> 00:11.505
Boston is 617.

00:11.646 --> 00:15.714
We used to be 617 some years ago.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.500
So you have a lot of Irish readers up here.

00:18.940 --> 00:19.221
Is that right?

00:19.555 --> 00:21.118
I suppose so.

00:21.138 --> 00:22.080
Worcester and Boston.

00:22.380 --> 00:25.086
As many as you'll find anywhere at this point.

00:25.927 --> 00:35.826
I do have a couple of papers elsewhere, so we'll hope to make this of general interest, not just...

00:36.228 --> 00:38.575
Not just in the land of the college.

00:38.976 --> 00:39.076
Yeah.

00:39.096 --> 00:41.704
Well, of course, you know, Holy Cross College is here in Worcester.

00:41.925 --> 00:43.248
This is Worcester, basically.

00:43.309 --> 00:44.532
Yeah, yeah.

00:44.552 --> 00:48.604
And I have readers in the Boston area because I'm in Quincy as well.

00:48.644 --> 00:50.710
The Quincy paper takes my call.

00:51.584 --> 00:52.967
So tell me a little bit about this.

00:53.148 --> 00:55.132
It's a pretty bold title, don't you think?

00:55.373 --> 00:55.874
Yeah, it is.

00:57.859 --> 00:58.801
Tell me if you don't mind.

00:58.861 --> 00:59.643
Have you read any of it?

00:59.804 --> 01:00.104
Oh, yeah.

01:00.265 --> 01:00.846
Okay, all right.

01:00.866 --> 01:06.560
I just wanted to hear what your level was before we got started.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.442
My level of what?

01:08.484 --> 01:09.627
Of what you've...

01:09.910 --> 01:11.632
what you've read of the book or what you can understand.

01:11.652 --> 01:14.115
Well, I mean, I have every kind of interviewer at this point.

01:14.155 --> 01:17.059
I've had those who've read a couple of pages, those who've read nothing at all.

01:17.179 --> 01:20.202
Well, I would say I'm knowledgeable on the subject.

01:20.583 --> 01:20.963
All right.

01:20.983 --> 01:28.252
I've just written my own book, as a matter of fact, which Holt is publishing, and it's on the preservation of libraries and texts.

01:28.312 --> 01:30.355
Oh, really?

01:30.475 --> 01:32.277
Yeah, it's a school week.

01:32.297 --> 01:33.218
I don't have to have this on.

01:34.598 --> 01:36.360
We're back on again.

01:36.841 --> 01:40.344
So anyway, we talked about the bold title.

01:40.885 --> 01:41.706
Let's start with that.

01:42.707 --> 01:46.151
The concept of the Irish saving civilization.

01:46.531 --> 01:50.856
What they really saved was the content of civilization, which is its books.

01:56.623 --> 02:01.348
As I say several times during the book, I think it's pretty...

02:01.666 --> 02:30.272
conclusive that without them we would certainly have lost most of or perhaps all of latin literature we wouldn't have lost greek because there was an eastern empire that survived the crash of the western empire and greek would probably be available to us someplace or another you're talking about as a language or as a relic as a literature greek you know i mean you know

02:31.012 --> 02:34.697
But much of Greek literature was lost anyway.

02:34.897 --> 02:40.724
I mean, most of the plays of the three great tragedians are gone.

02:40.804 --> 02:47.393
We have a few plays of each one, and each one of them wrote about 80 plays, I think.

02:47.413 --> 02:49.656
Most of those are gone.

02:50.477 --> 02:54.562
It's not coverable unless we have another Qumran discovery.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.850
But I think what's more important is that

03:01.454 --> 03:09.408
with the loss of the literature would have been lost the habit of mind, the literate habit of mind.

03:09.969 --> 03:23.513
And without the Irish, without their copying those books during the 100-year period that really goes from the end of the 5th century to the end of the 6th century,

03:24.083 --> 03:27.609
I think Western Europe would probably have become Muslim.

03:28.690 --> 03:34.359
And therefore would have been a very, very different, would have taken a very different turn from what it did take.

03:34.379 --> 03:39.948
And does this preclude the efforts of other monks or were the Irish the only monks, the only scribes?

03:40.068 --> 03:45.016
Well, they really... I mean, there was a pretty, pretty significant monastery at Monte Cassino, for instance.

03:45.176 --> 03:46.659
Yeah, but that's later, that's 6th century.

03:46.799 --> 03:47.981
Yeah.

03:48.081 --> 03:51.306
You know, Benedict doesn't get under, you know, Benedict...

03:51.944 --> 03:53.846
It misses out by 100 years.

03:53.906 --> 04:12.364
The really crucial period is from the fall of Rome, which is 476, to the end of the, so really from the last quarter of the 5th century to the end of the 6th century.

04:12.404 --> 04:13.766
It's about a 100-year period.

04:14.386 --> 04:21.293
And during that period, as far as we can make out, I can only count

04:22.015 --> 04:26.319
two libraries on the continent.

04:26.519 --> 04:37.030
Actually, really only one, because the other, one, two, or three, but probably only one library that we are aware of, and let's say there were a few more.

04:38.251 --> 04:42.715
The art of copying had just come to an end.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.477
Could you identify the two libraries for me?

04:45.618 --> 04:51.904
Well, the most important one would be Vivarium,

04:52.255 --> 05:14.582
By the end of the 4th century, one writer says that all the libraries of Rome have been closed.

05:15.983 --> 05:20.068
That may be a hyperbole, but certainly by the end of the 5th century,

05:20.538 --> 05:22.743
the copying had stopped.

05:22.763 --> 05:27.775
Gregory the Great established a library at Rome, but that's in the 6th century.

05:28.637 --> 05:37.298
And it was a very small library, and it was... Gregory, so far as we know, didn't really know any Greek, and there probably wasn't...

05:37.700 --> 05:40.603
much there in the way of Plato and those people.

05:41.264 --> 05:45.649
And he also didn't, he was against the reading of the pagan classics.

05:45.669 --> 05:51.636
So we don't really know what his library was made up of, but we assume that it was a pretty small library.

05:52.657 --> 05:58.103
Isidore of Seville, at the end of the 6th century, builds a library.

05:58.824 --> 05:59.805
And it's a great library.

05:59.846 --> 06:03.350
It's the sort of first great library of the Dark Ages.

06:03.490 --> 06:06.373
The only other one that we know about is Cassiodorus's

06:06.725 --> 06:11.169
which he called Vivarium, and that was in Calabria.

06:11.450 --> 06:14.373
In my book, I pick up with Cassi Doris.

06:14.573 --> 06:15.053
It really is.

06:15.093 --> 06:22.381
I have to say, this subject that you're writing about has really not been touched to any great extent, has it?

06:22.401 --> 06:28.327
No, it hasn't, and it's very hard to come by information on what the monks did.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.569
We know that there was this 100-year period.

06:30.609 --> 06:33.812
We know that within 100 years,

06:34.197 --> 06:41.205
that during that period the copying had stopped, and therefore if it hadn't been resumed, the link would have been permanently broken.

06:42.126 --> 06:45.890
But an awful lot about what the Irish monks did is a mystery.

06:47.591 --> 06:53.037
What does Isaac Taylor say about the history of the transmission of text from ancient times?

06:53.057 --> 06:54.959
Are you familiar with that book?

06:55.300 --> 06:56.001
I know what it is.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.123
I'm wondering.

06:58.143 --> 07:02.027
I use it as a source, but not to any great extent in my own book.

07:02.632 --> 07:08.018
You know, we've heard about the... This is a very interesting book to me, you know, when Marley... I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:08.038 --> 07:08.359
Go ahead.

07:08.399 --> 07:08.959
No, go ahead.

07:09.620 --> 07:09.900
Go ahead.

07:09.940 --> 07:13.885
But you mentioned Cassiodorus is coming up in the sixth century.

07:13.905 --> 07:18.450
Well, you know, but that's really, you know, we're well into the sixth century there.

07:19.151 --> 07:22.415
And, I mean, that is during the hundred-year period that I'm talking about.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.317
But that's it.

07:24.517 --> 07:29.483
Those are the three libraries, and depending on how you rate them, you know...

07:30.948 --> 07:35.356
Certainly Isidore of Seville is the beginning of sort of the new era.

07:35.376 --> 07:42.328
And Cassiodorus, it's a little hard to know.

07:42.368 --> 07:44.072
We don't know very much about it.

07:44.272 --> 07:45.714
We don't know what happened to it.

07:47.498 --> 07:51.004
The paper library continued and became larger and larger.

07:51.785 --> 07:54.390
And it was Gregory the Great that established it.

07:54.843 --> 07:56.605
He also sent Augustine to England.

07:57.106 --> 08:00.650
He sent Augustine to England, but that's almost 150 years after Patrick.

08:01.912 --> 08:19.553
It seems at that point, and you've got this great figure of Gregory the Great, he's truly a great figure, mounting the first papal mission to the barbarians, but it took him a century and a half longer than it took Patrick.

08:20.354 --> 08:22.437
So there's a big...

08:23.294 --> 08:40.717
There's a big gap there in which it seems the continental Christians had more than enough to do just to keep themselves from becoming victims and did very little else during that period.

08:40.837 --> 08:46.585
How do you account for this, I mean, for this hundred-year miracle?

08:47.020 --> 08:49.925
What do you... Well, in a way, it's simple.

08:50.265 --> 09:01.684
It's one of the sort of serendipities of history that the last people on Earth who should have been right for this role were the Irish.

09:01.945 --> 09:07.273
And you're clear about that very early on in the book, too.

09:07.293 --> 09:13.163
As I said, they're sort of child, you know, warrior children, basically, where they're killing one another and

09:13.632 --> 09:16.334
stealing one another's cattle, and that was what they did.

09:16.374 --> 09:17.355
I mean, that was all they did.

09:20.078 --> 09:26.183
Patrick impressed the hell out of them because he was such a strong-minded character.

09:26.223 --> 09:34.090
And Patrick, though himself kind of almost quasi-literate, I mean, he was literate, but he was not literate.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.632
Cicero would hardly have called him literate.

09:39.455 --> 09:43.318
He knew perfectly well that Christianity couldn't survive without literacy.

09:43.838 --> 09:51.560
So literacy comes with Patrick, and once the Irish learn to read, they obviously get this great kick out of it.

09:51.600 --> 09:58.860
I mean, that's my own interpretation, but they enjoy the copying of the books, which another...

09:59.566 --> 10:05.553
group of people might have considered a great bore, they just enjoy it, and they make it into something.

10:05.993 --> 10:10.499
Again, you say this does predate the precepts of Benedict, right?

10:10.819 --> 10:11.179
Oh, yeah.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.462
Because he did institutionalize.

10:13.882 --> 10:16.005
Yeah, yeah.

10:16.125 --> 10:21.671
I mean, he actually set down the terms by which copying is done, by which scribes worked.

10:22.292 --> 10:24.074
Yes, but he's still 100 years later.

10:24.114 --> 10:25.776
He's still after the transition.

10:26.785 --> 10:31.349
So the stuff that they worked from was the stuff that was passed on to them by the Irish scribes?

10:32.630 --> 10:34.032
Basically, I think that's true.

10:34.112 --> 10:35.433
I don't think I can prove it.

10:35.893 --> 10:41.618
But we know that Benedict and his monks follow the Irish and overwhelm them.

10:41.638 --> 10:42.900
Chronologically, they follow.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.202
But do you think they had any ancient stuff to work with themselves?

10:46.963 --> 10:50.486
Or do you think all the primary stuff was by then destroyed?

10:51.087 --> 10:52.348
Most of it should have been gone.

10:53.109 --> 10:55.331
There would have to have been very little left.

10:56.051 --> 10:56.792
You know, you can't

10:57.076 --> 11:02.867
I mean, there's no way at this point in time of saying what was there and what wasn't.

11:02.967 --> 11:04.234
One of the things that

11:04.636 --> 11:10.223
my editor, Nan Talese, wanted me to do was to say exactly which manuscripts they say.

11:10.243 --> 11:13.427
And there's just no way of... How can you possibly say that?

11:13.807 --> 11:18.953
Well, you know, it's a historical problem, but... Is that right?

11:18.973 --> 11:20.955
She wanted you to say precisely which ones they saved?

11:21.676 --> 11:21.756
Huh?

11:21.776 --> 11:23.739
She wanted you to say precisely what was saved?

11:24.019 --> 11:24.199
Yes.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.766
Well, I understand the question, but I also... She should look into the sources a little bit.

11:29.746 --> 11:32.029
I mean, it is vague.

11:32.089 --> 11:34.732
I mean, you just have to know that there's a tradition here at work.

11:35.112 --> 11:44.143
Well, the other thing is that most of what they saved is now lost in the sense that we don't... You know, a book like the Book of Kells is an extraordinary exception.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.968
You know, there are only a few hundred Irish codexes left.

11:48.849 --> 11:52.153
So most of what they actually did is gone.

11:52.694 --> 11:54.736
So we can't say they did this, this, or the other thing.

11:54.756 --> 11:59.702
We can say, well, from what's left, we can say that the Irish codex was not merely...

12:00.863 --> 12:09.511
copying of one book, but was a collection often of as many things as the scribe could put into a book.

12:09.591 --> 12:11.413
It was a kind of mixed media event.

12:12.174 --> 12:24.125
And we know that one way or another, I mean, most of our own manuscripts, say, of Virgil are much later than this period.

12:24.986 --> 12:29.390
There's very little from this period left.

12:29.570 --> 12:30.651
There are a few things

12:31.323 --> 12:34.866
Some of our oldest manuscripts are Celtic manuscripts.

12:34.946 --> 12:43.674
Yeah, but I'm picking up now when people like Poggio and Patroc and Boccaccio and they start going to Monte Cassino and St.

12:43.694 --> 12:54.625
Gall and these places, and they're discovering these things buried under dust and mice, the droppings and stuff like that, and they find Quintilian and all these others.

12:55.445 --> 13:00.570
Are they finding, by your feeling, Irish manuscripts?

13:01.597 --> 13:19.556
copies, or are they finding, you know, when we talk about the rediscovery of ancient texts, and I'm going away from Ireland now, again, I'm in the continent, you know, we have this humanist rediscovery of classic texts.

13:19.576 --> 13:20.877
I don't think there's any way of knowing.

13:22.439 --> 13:30.928
And I'm not trying to challenge your thesis here, but it's a question, you know, it's a legitimate question, I think.

13:31.128 --> 13:38.555
It is a legitimate question, and I think that the true answer is that we don't know what the early humanists were.

13:39.595 --> 13:42.598
We often, at least, don't know what they were looking at.

13:43.859 --> 13:46.682
Were some of those texts, Irish texts, I think they must have been.

13:47.602 --> 13:50.905
But that's not a conclusion, that's an assumption.

13:52.106 --> 13:54.629
We just don't know enough.

13:55.229 --> 13:59.633
There's a wonderful account of when, I guess it was Boccaccio, I guess he just lifted...

14:00.119 --> 14:25.384
a text from the Monte Cassino and of course he never said it but it was another it was another companion who reported it it was a Poggio I forget which one but this this is when he discovered Tacitus yeah and uh you know and I believe that that that that particular manuscript survives and it's in it because it's in a certain script and I don't know if it's an uncial script or something that that was quite

14:25.685 --> 14:30.292
if not unique, but distinctive to what was practiced at that monastery.

14:31.434 --> 14:34.920
Who's to say what the original source was for that?

14:35.381 --> 14:36.082
I mean, I don't know.

14:36.102 --> 14:37.524
I'm not picking, I guess.

14:37.584 --> 14:40.189
I'm just curious about... Anyway, go ahead.

14:40.209 --> 14:40.569
I'm sorry.

14:40.810 --> 14:41.731
I'm making a comment.

14:41.751 --> 14:52.148
No, much of this I sort of treated lightly because they're...

14:52.567 --> 14:57.071
I mean, not only do I not know enough about it, but so far as I can make out, no one does.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.695
It's a study yet to be done.

15:00.715 --> 15:03.357
Yeah, well, now let's go back to the genesis.

15:03.718 --> 15:05.659
How long have you been toying with this?

15:06.140 --> 15:08.122
I have a feeling this goes back to student days.

15:09.023 --> 15:14.208
You certainly credit a lot of Jesuits here in your accomplishments.

15:14.228 --> 15:16.290
That's true.

15:18.332 --> 15:19.873
Well, they're sort of the dim...

15:20.225 --> 15:22.468
progenitors of this work.

15:22.488 --> 15:29.799
But my wife and I spent a year in Ireland about almost 25 years ago.

15:31.262 --> 15:34.006
Actually, exactly 25 years ago, which is frightening.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.172
We did a book for Scribner.

15:38.192 --> 15:39.875
It's called A Literary Guide to Ireland.

15:40.836 --> 15:44.902
And it was a guide to the Ireland of the writers.

15:45.042 --> 15:49.489
And as we went around, I became more and more fascinated by the early stuff.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.743
and realized that very, very little had been done about it.

15:53.224 --> 16:16.371
And I also, you know, gradually thinking about it, came to imagine this story as one of, you know, that was extremely paradoxical, the idea of these essentially wild and woolly people being the ones...

16:17.093 --> 16:33.347
were given the role of saving civilization the only ones left the only the only country at peace and and literate enough to take up the task and yet they were such from given their personality and their culture they were such

16:34.238 --> 16:52.737
such an odd choice if you could speak about it maybe their insularity helped in this particular case well i think it did and i think also the fact that this childlike quality i think also enabled them to to be the drones of the western world in effect you know to do this stuff over and over again um

16:53.830 --> 17:05.903
something that might have bored the ass off more literate, more sophisticated people, they thought was a lot of fun, the way children think that repetitive tasks are fun.

17:06.623 --> 17:11.028
Well, you think that this was undertaken for amusement and not for mission?

17:11.368 --> 17:13.591
No, it was undertaken.

17:13.691 --> 17:15.433
They were serious about it.

17:15.453 --> 17:16.674
There's no question about that.

17:16.754 --> 17:20.698
But when you look at the manuscripts,

17:21.218 --> 17:38.248
you realize that they were also having an awful lot of fun, not only with the design, but you can see that in many cases the scribe has become bored with the actual text he's copying, and so he does something else.

17:38.268 --> 17:38.629
Doodles.

17:38.869 --> 17:39.390
That's wonderful.

17:39.430 --> 17:40.252
I've seen these things.

17:40.332 --> 17:41.013
They're wonderful.

17:41.374 --> 17:44.880
Or, which is why we have all this early Irish literature,

17:45.316 --> 17:46.918
He puts a little poem in the margin.

17:46.938 --> 17:50.203
It might be his own or it might be something he heard somewhere as a child.

17:50.223 --> 17:55.431
You know, you don't really know where he came upon it or what its origin is, but it's early Irish.

17:56.413 --> 18:07.830
And therefore, by accumulation from all these glosses, we have the earliest vernacular literature of Europe in written form.

18:08.317 --> 18:12.884
Thanks to the wandering minds of these scribes.

18:12.904 --> 18:14.887
You quote some of them here, which are delightful.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.351
Well, I think they're great.

18:17.371 --> 18:18.372
I love them.

18:18.412 --> 18:30.511
My favorite of all, I think, is the one about Pangra Band, because I think it really does give you the playful quality of the scribal mind.

18:33.055 --> 18:36.881
You know, the one about the cat.

18:36.901 --> 18:37.041
Mm-hmm.

18:37.797 --> 18:45.067
because, you know, it's several stanzas and it's very, very well thought out.

18:45.628 --> 19:01.289
And you can almost see the monk, you know, copying and also occasionally looking at his cat and is getting this sense of paradigm.

19:02.691 --> 19:05.034
You know, that he's like the cat and the cat is like him.

19:06.096 --> 19:06.336
And

19:06.502 --> 19:27.885
just playing with it in his mind until the whole poem is there so he's going along as he's going along you can almost imagine you know writing a few copying out a few more things and then going back and trying another line of his poem until it you know finally is all there there is a really it's you can see a playful mind exercising itself right in the poem itself

19:28.490 --> 19:34.299
So the genesis of this thing is 25 years ago, during a trip, your wife and yourself made to Ireland.

19:34.319 --> 19:34.459
Yeah.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.663
And, you know, bring me forward a little bit now.

19:36.683 --> 19:39.828
I mean, that's when the germ was planted, I guess, the seed of it.

19:39.868 --> 19:42.572
And I guess it just sat there, and I read various things.

19:42.632 --> 19:52.388
And then about five years ago, when I came to work at Doubleday, Nan Talese, who was the editor and publisher of her own imprint.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.770
I know Nan, by the way.

19:53.790 --> 19:53.890
Yeah.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.504
Okay, is she?

19:55.964 --> 19:57.346
I didn't know she was a Hearn.

19:57.686 --> 20:00.148
I didn't know the A was for a Hearn, but that's cute, too.

20:00.169 --> 20:00.869
That's worth knowing.

20:01.750 --> 20:06.835
Well, I thought I'd throw that in, you know.

20:06.855 --> 20:07.836
I thought she was Italian.

20:07.876 --> 20:08.857
That's just how much I know.

20:09.678 --> 20:12.560
No, she's definitely not Italian.

20:12.661 --> 20:13.702
I'm teasing her.

20:13.722 --> 20:14.763
Don't tell her I said that.

20:14.783 --> 20:16.564
I know Nan pretty well.

20:16.644 --> 20:19.827
Go ahead.

20:20.288 --> 20:21.009
No chance of that.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.510
That's cute.

20:23.249 --> 20:25.192
She married an Italian.

20:25.212 --> 20:26.875
I'll tell you another thing about her in a minute.

20:28.077 --> 20:42.802
I had just come to Doubleday as Director of Religious Publishing, and I met Nan at the first sales conference I went to, and I mentioned to her that I was working on a proposal that would be for a book called How the Irish Saved Civilization, and she said I want to see it right away.

20:42.962 --> 20:44.545
So this was your title all along?

20:44.926 --> 20:46.428
Yes.

20:46.809 --> 20:48.632
Yes, it was.

20:49.237 --> 20:54.085
I always thought that was... It was known as a ballsy... Well, why not?

20:54.105 --> 20:54.205
Sure.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.693
Well, basically, of course, it's comical and it's meant to.

20:58.713 --> 21:05.524
You know, one of the salesmen said in his call reports, I don't know, he said these...

21:06.938 --> 21:09.520
These booksellers keep ordering this book.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.322
I keep telling them that it's a blank book.

21:13.504 --> 21:15.186
That has its precursors.

21:15.366 --> 21:22.072
When I was book editor at Worcester for many years, there was a book that came in one year, and it was the Irish Love Manual.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.154
It was called Brace Yourself, Bridget.

21:24.674 --> 21:24.795
Right.

21:24.815 --> 21:25.275
Do you remember it?

21:25.295 --> 21:26.156
It was published by St.

21:26.176 --> 21:26.516
Martin's.

21:26.997 --> 21:27.637
And you know what it was?

21:27.917 --> 21:28.618
It was just blank.

21:28.638 --> 21:29.439
It was all blank.

21:30.540 --> 21:34.644
And any sucker who buys this deserves to be parted from his money, you know.

21:35.164 --> 21:36.085
But anyway, go ahead.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.183
Go ahead.

21:40.024 --> 21:41.346
So that's how I wrote it.

21:43.129 --> 21:48.417
I finally had to get down to brass tacks and finish it to complete the contract.

21:51.121 --> 21:55.327
Nan herself has never been particularly interested in her Irish background.

21:55.367 --> 22:03.439
Her father was Irish and her mother's family came over on the Mayflower, which I think is the part that she more nearly stressed.

22:04.280 --> 22:13.708
But reading this manuscript, she realized how, and I always said to her, you know, you're extremely Irish, and she said she had no idea what I was talking about.

22:14.489 --> 22:19.233
And then she came to the part of that Queen Maeve with whom she identified completely.

22:19.273 --> 22:19.893
That's right.

22:20.754 --> 22:22.676
You mentioned that in the notes.

22:23.136 --> 22:24.537
And rightly so.

22:24.597 --> 22:30.783
I mean, she has that kind of, you know, in the end, is unafraid to take on any task.

22:30.823 --> 22:33.645
She's got immense willpower.

22:34.267 --> 22:39.995
And, I mean, she's an Irish type, whether she knows it or not.

22:40.195 --> 22:41.457
She does know it now.

22:42.218 --> 22:44.722
And she's seen herself in this literature.

22:46.424 --> 22:48.407
You also, let's hook this into St.

22:48.427 --> 22:53.134
Patrick's Day if we can, because this is the occasion I'm using to get it out there.

22:55.136 --> 22:59.943
This really is a, how do I get into this?

23:01.265 --> 23:02.687
You're certainly telling the Irish people

23:03.106 --> 23:07.671
Irish people, Irish Americans that, boy, you've got a lot to be proud of here.

23:07.711 --> 23:08.291
It's not just St.

23:08.311 --> 23:09.893
Patrick's day, St.

23:09.913 --> 23:13.036
Patrick purportedly driving the snakes out of Ireland, right?

23:13.737 --> 23:15.359
I think we're going a little deeper than that, aren't we?

23:15.499 --> 23:18.322
I think he's remembered for all the wrong reasons.

23:18.362 --> 23:20.904
I think he's one of the greatest figures of Western history.

23:21.525 --> 23:28.152
And all we do is dye the beer green in his honor.

23:29.212 --> 23:30.875
Remember, I live outside of Boston.

23:30.995 --> 23:33.018
I know where you are.

23:34.921 --> 23:39.909
There are really three things that he did that are extraordinary and actually unique.

23:40.510 --> 23:41.892
And none of them had anything to do with snakes.

23:42.132 --> 23:43.535
None of them had a thing to do with snakes.

23:43.575 --> 23:48.823
The snakes were not there before he came, and they were not there after he left.

23:49.597 --> 23:55.525
That's just, you know... That's a fact of... We don't want to say evolution here.

23:55.545 --> 23:59.731
Well, it's the flora and fauna of Ireland never included snakes, period.

23:59.751 --> 24:00.893
They just never got there.

24:01.974 --> 24:05.138
The only snakes in Ireland are in the zoo, and that was always the case.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.905
Three things.

24:10.085 --> 24:17.275
Yeah, the first thing is that he is the first human being in history

24:17.592 --> 24:22.298
So far as I can make out it, I'm virtually sure that I am standing on firm ground here.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.763
The first human being in history to unequivocally condemn slavery as immoral.

24:28.124 --> 24:31.068
And this is in a period in which no one thought about that.

24:31.088 --> 24:32.470
I mean, you remember that St.

24:32.490 --> 24:36.154
Paul said, slaves be obedient to your masters.

24:36.474 --> 24:39.478
And he said that agreed four centuries before Patrick.

24:40.399 --> 24:41.380
That's in the Bible, right?

24:41.661 --> 24:41.941
Yeah.

24:42.622 --> 24:43.483
Great.

24:43.503 --> 24:44.684
It's in the New Testament.

24:44.704 --> 24:46.266
Flaves be obedient to your masters.

24:47.343 --> 24:51.209
That was the morality of the time, and nobody thought anything else.

24:51.349 --> 24:58.621
But Patrick was a Roman citizen who was enslaved, wrongly enslaved, as I'm sure Roman citizens would have thought, by the Irish.

24:59.462 --> 25:05.713
And having been at the receiving end of somebody else's brutality, he came to understand what that meant.

25:05.793 --> 25:06.914
And he condemned slavery.

25:06.955 --> 25:10.380
Nobody does that again until the Anabaptists in the 17th century.

25:10.597 --> 25:18.989
We do not hear a peep out of anybody anywhere in the entire world on the subject of slavery until the 17th century, late 17th century.

25:19.009 --> 25:20.731
Nothing recorded in any case.

25:20.931 --> 25:22.514
And that's what we're talking about when we say history.

25:22.534 --> 25:23.435
That's what history is.

25:23.495 --> 25:24.677
That's exactly right.

25:25.157 --> 25:30.965
I mean, of course, someone somewhere must have had this thought because it's a human thought to have.

25:31.706 --> 25:33.829
But no one articulated it.

25:34.470 --> 25:36.553
So he is, you know...

25:37.478 --> 25:47.854
And then with the Anabaptists and the Quakers, you have the beginnings of the anti-slavery movement, which in the 18th and 19th centuries really took off.

25:47.874 --> 25:56.367
But here's somebody way, way, way before all of that who knows exactly what he thinks of this and says it very, very clearly.

25:57.609 --> 26:02.176
That in itself, I think, is of enormous significance.

26:02.196 --> 26:05.140
The second thing is that he is...

26:05.390 --> 26:08.906
I, by my life, actually the first missionary.

26:09.489 --> 26:11.197
Christianity is five centuries old.

26:11.217 --> 26:12.885
It is not a new religion.

26:13.456 --> 26:15.438
Five centuries is a long time.

26:15.458 --> 26:15.798
Sure is.

26:16.379 --> 26:21.484
And, you know, we think of it that way because it's ten centuries removed from us, but five centuries is a lot of centuries.

26:21.544 --> 26:26.970
When the Greek tragedians were writing about Homer, I was, you know, six, seven hundred years old.

26:26.990 --> 26:29.733
I mean, people don't realize that, you know.

26:29.753 --> 26:30.634
It was ancient to them.

26:30.754 --> 26:32.135
Long time, you know.

26:32.196 --> 26:35.919
I mean, the United States has lasted a little bit more than 200 years.

26:35.939 --> 26:37.401
It seems a long time to us.

26:37.501 --> 26:39.203
Five hundred is even longer.

26:39.823 --> 26:43.227
So Christianity had a lot of time to develop

26:43.696 --> 26:47.341
to reflect on what it was about.

26:47.561 --> 26:54.270
And in the Gospels itself, Jesus orders the apostles to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.

26:54.731 --> 26:57.214
They didn't go anywhere near the ends of the earth.

26:57.955 --> 26:59.878
They never got out of the Mediterranean.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.724
I mean, Christianity stayed within the Roman fold.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.748
It stayed within the Roman Empire.

27:07.868 --> 27:12.775
The only exception to that could be

27:12.890 --> 27:19.600
Thomas going to India, most scholars very much doubt that he went to India, but let's assume that he did.

27:20.341 --> 27:26.090
India was a civilization with many, many ties to the Greek world.

27:26.230 --> 27:33.100
We're much more aware of that now than we once were, of how close India and Greece were to one another culturally.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.988
So he didn't really go off to the fuzzy wuzzies.

27:38.008 --> 27:40.872
Yeah, you use that phrase, the fuzzy wuzzies.

27:41.898 --> 27:53.913
You know, the people of whom we are afraid, the people of whom civilized people are afraid, whoever they may be in a particular society or culture or time.

27:53.933 --> 27:59.641
And the Romans were scared to death of the barbarians.

27:59.661 --> 28:01.723
They wanted nothing to do with them.

28:01.743 --> 28:03.185
They were beyond the pale.

28:03.205 --> 28:04.327
They were unthinkable.

28:05.128 --> 28:06.850
And Patrick does this.

28:06.890 --> 28:10.875
He's the first person in history to preach to barbarians beyond the reach of Roman law.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.708
which makes him, in many ways, the first missionary.

28:15.411 --> 28:17.193
There just wasn't an awful lot of that.

28:17.233 --> 28:18.855
Or, if you like, the second missionary.

28:19.676 --> 28:26.345
There was not this rage to evangelize that we imagine there must have been.

28:27.186 --> 28:28.087
It wasn't there.

28:29.148 --> 28:40.423
And it's really, as a result of Patrick, I think, that Gregory the Great, a century later, a century and a half later, decides to push...

28:40.960 --> 28:43.964
Augustine to go to Canterbury.

28:46.027 --> 28:49.652
Augustine, this is a good example, this is a century and a half later.

28:49.812 --> 28:50.874
Carried nine books with him.

28:52.035 --> 28:52.396
Very good.

28:52.656 --> 29:08.518
And if you read in Bede, as he goes across the continent from Rome to the coast of Gaul in preparation, he keeps sending messengers back to the Pope saying, we have all met together and we've decided this really isn't a good idea, okay?

29:08.538 --> 29:08.638
Okay.

29:09.142 --> 29:18.133
And finally, getting no positive answer, not the answer that he wants, Augustine himself returns.

29:18.513 --> 29:19.554
It's not Augustine, huh?

29:19.574 --> 29:20.195
It's Augustine.

29:20.315 --> 29:21.497
Well, whichever you like.

29:21.717 --> 29:22.598
Oh, go ahead.

29:22.658 --> 29:26.583
For some reason, Catholics always say Augustine and Protestants say Augustine.

29:26.663 --> 29:27.123
I'm neither.

29:27.183 --> 29:28.445
I'm Greek.

29:28.465 --> 29:31.048
And if anybody can tell me why that is, I don't know.

29:31.028 --> 29:35.253
It's something that I, growing up, learned to say Augustine.

29:35.353 --> 29:35.994
That's fine.

29:36.094 --> 29:37.656
Others learned to say Augustine.

29:37.756 --> 29:38.317
I'm teasing.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.759
As I said, I'm Greek.

29:39.819 --> 29:40.900
I'm neutral with this.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.623
His mother called him Augustinus.

29:46.026 --> 29:47.188
What do you do with that?

29:48.269 --> 29:49.250
Go ahead.

29:49.831 --> 29:53.155
Augustine.

29:53.438 --> 29:57.124
finally comes back all the way to Rome from somewhere in Gaul.

29:57.144 --> 30:02.091
He comes all the way back to Rome to see Gregory and say to Gregory, look, we really don't want to do this.

30:02.151 --> 30:02.932
We think this is nuts.

30:02.952 --> 30:05.276
We're all going to get killed.

30:05.576 --> 30:12.968
And Gregory stares him down and says, when once you have put your hand to a task, do not turn back.

30:14.550 --> 30:15.111
He's a pope.

30:15.131 --> 30:15.672
He can get away.

30:15.712 --> 30:16.593
He can say that.

30:16.613 --> 30:19.397
Well, he's the pope, but he's also not the pope that the pope is today.

30:19.478 --> 30:21.100
I mean, a large part of the

30:21.417 --> 30:24.221
idea of the papacy was created by Gregory himself.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.784
But he was Gregory the Great, right?

30:27.065 --> 30:29.468
But he's such a huge personality, you know.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.871
He obviously knew how to steer people down.

30:32.412 --> 30:49.456
So this little Roman librarian, which is what Augustine was, you know, scurries back across the continent like a mouse, and by the time he arrives on the Isle of Thanet and confronts the King of Kent, he's shaking like a leaf.

30:50.297 --> 30:51.238
You know, this is not

30:51.505 --> 30:52.687
This is not Patrick.

30:52.907 --> 30:59.057
This is somebody ordered to do this much, much against his own better judgment.

30:59.077 --> 31:01.521
He expected to be boiled or something like that.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.925
Did you give me the third Patrick item, by the way?

31:03.965 --> 31:04.446
No, I didn't.

31:04.466 --> 31:04.806
Okay.

31:07.230 --> 31:07.971
All right, the third.

31:08.011 --> 31:09.033
I'm sorry to get you there.

31:09.674 --> 31:13.360
The third one is... Oh, hold on a second.

31:13.380 --> 31:14.762
I've got to switch the tape.
