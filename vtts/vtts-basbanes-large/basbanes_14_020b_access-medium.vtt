WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:04.038
Okay, go ahead.

00:04.059 --> 00:05.627
They're about to do something.

00:05.687 --> 00:10.632
They're about to do something really...

00:10.865 --> 00:16.372
There's no guy's intention to burn the books like the author.

00:16.592 --> 00:16.692
Evil.

00:17.313 --> 00:23.701
I mean, you can say the word evil or nasty.

00:23.721 --> 00:25.723
I think you can maybe use a stronger word than that.

00:25.743 --> 00:25.844
Evil.

00:25.864 --> 00:25.984
Evil.

00:26.004 --> 00:27.345
Evil.

00:27.366 --> 00:28.187
I don't want to put words in there.

00:28.207 --> 00:29.008
No, no, no.

00:29.028 --> 00:35.956
They want, in a way, to erase the memory.

00:36.096 --> 00:38.239
So they target the...

00:38.573 --> 00:45.189
the places, the institutions where the memory is kept.

00:46.712 --> 00:55.333
But let us be wise and use this tragic experience to think about the following.

00:55.313 --> 01:24.426
there is no way that such an attack and such a destruction can be fruitful because if you have in your mind several verses of your favorite poet and if all the books of that poet

01:25.165 --> 01:47.443
by some miracle disappear by some catastrophe by some natural catastrophe that miracle that's the other way you will definitely because you are passionately involved with the lyrics you love teach your little kids

01:48.250 --> 01:59.561
So we're going back to the oral tradition then, is what you're saying.

02:00.542 --> 02:05.267
It's almost homeric in a way, isn't it?

02:05.287 --> 02:05.707
Yes.

02:05.727 --> 02:05.807
Yes.

02:05.828 --> 02:09.031
So they've forced you to return to before the age of books and printing.

02:09.051 --> 02:14.376
You know the book, Fahrenheit 451, where they memorize the scriptures so they can say... You will do the same thing.

02:14.356 --> 02:28.689
You know, if you are in jeopardy.

02:28.709 --> 02:29.611
The books in our minds, we know in the minds.

02:29.631 --> 02:30.593
The books in our minds are the part of our life.

02:30.573 --> 02:44.265
We're not here to eat, we're just having a couple of years.

02:44.285 --> 02:51.472
It's very hard to destroy what you really love and want.

02:51.492 --> 02:55.315
What you really love and cherish.

02:55.335 --> 02:55.736
Why you read a book?

02:55.756 --> 03:00.360
You want to open yourself, your mind to some kind of a different experience.

03:00.728 --> 03:02.436
But, uh...

03:02.720 --> 03:08.929
You are the one discovering these words that does not have the meaning by themselves.

03:10.411 --> 03:11.373
Isn't it so?

03:11.393 --> 03:18.724
You cannot understand the book if it's written on a foreign language, I mean language that you don't know.

03:18.744 --> 03:20.887
Do you enjoy, no, reading?

03:21.167 --> 03:21.408
Yes.

03:22.049 --> 03:31.022
You are enjoying, but you open your mind to a new perspective, to new visions, to new fiction.

03:31.795 --> 03:38.890
the new virtual reality.

03:38.910 --> 03:45.083
You know, you can destroy the books better.

03:45.103 --> 03:46.647
You know what me and my wife did?

03:47.288 --> 03:49.994
How I sing a lullaby to my wife.

03:50.014 --> 03:51.036
Because lullaby, lullaby is to go to sleep.

03:51.016 --> 04:13.866
I'm just saying it from the tape so I can understand it when I come to... We have lots of useless time because there is no electricity and you have to be very careful where to put the oil.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.770
You don't mind if I unbutton my shirt there.

04:16.750 --> 04:21.310
in our meal or spend it on the light.

04:21.931 --> 04:38.537
So we got in bed very early.

04:38.558 --> 04:42.444
And we've been sick of the sleeping, you know.

04:42.464 --> 04:43.265
So we were talking.

04:43.285 --> 04:43.525
What we did?

04:43.545 --> 04:45.889
We recite all the songs that we ever heard.

04:45.909 --> 04:46.871
We sing to each other, different kind of a tune.

04:46.891 --> 04:47.372
Then we repeat it again.

04:47.392 --> 04:47.652
Then we sing.

04:47.632 --> 05:07.011
summarize and repeating all the books that we have read.

05:07.031 --> 05:08.193
Then we reread the library, the home library that we have.

05:08.213 --> 05:11.736
And then we do it again and again and again.

05:11.756 --> 05:13.538
In order to keep ourselves busy, to provoke a fine feeling, a good vibration, and we stop

05:13.855 --> 05:43.407
doing this ritual of falling asleep because if I fall asleep first if I fall asleep I start snoring I developed a habit to sleep my wife is going to sleep first so I can easily fall asleep and snore but she sleeps very deeply

05:43.876 --> 06:01.444
And I start this ritual of recollecting the memory, what we read, what we've gone through, where have we been, all these things endlessly.

06:01.464 --> 06:03.387
Because my wife at a certain point says, oh please shut up, you are repeating yourself.

06:03.367 --> 06:19.705
You know, it practically means I got out of the tunes.

06:19.726 --> 06:26.493
Needless to tell you that I recollect all the Beatles tunes, all the Rolling Stones tunes.

06:26.513 --> 06:29.897
I mean, I have a specials like Moody Blues, hundreds of thousands of the tunes that I sing to my wife as a lullaby.

06:29.877 --> 06:38.214
So it was interesting to her to get you to sleep.

06:38.234 --> 06:40.438
All after all, I had to go all over again.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.783
And she said, oh, forget it.

06:42.803 --> 06:43.785
You are repeating yourself.

06:44.828 --> 06:59.158
Amazing.

06:59.178 --> 07:02.164
You know, when you do not add the fresh information, the new books that you like to read, you do, you may not have to do what you may not have to do.

07:02.184 --> 07:02.685
You have to recollect it.

07:04.133 --> 07:24.045
to emphasize.

07:24.066 --> 07:24.947
You know, but also to reinforce it in a way.

07:24.967 --> 07:25.929
We are talking about things that keeps us alive.

07:25.949 --> 07:26.650
Alive in a sense that we are alive.

07:26.670 --> 07:28.232
And repetition is one way to do it, of course, is what you're saying, I guess.

07:28.252 --> 07:28.332
Yes.

07:28.353 --> 07:28.573
Definitely.

07:28.593 --> 07:28.673
Now,

07:28.653 --> 07:44.634
I understand that the night that the library burned, there was a chain of people trying to rescue books, and there was a young woman who was shot to death, is that not?

07:44.654 --> 07:46.617
I know, that's a false story.

07:46.637 --> 07:52.264
Aida Buturevich, a colleague of mine, and a good friend of mine, died

07:53.948 --> 08:04.443
while she was returning for home, I think two or three days before the burn-out of my day.

08:04.544 --> 08:05.525
That really didn't happen.

08:05.565 --> 08:07.468
That really didn't happen.

08:08.810 --> 08:16.221
But this story appears as an accident of getting the full information.

08:16.241 --> 08:21.649
The tragic story of Aida Baturi's parents is the following.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.331
His father was so upset.

08:23.783 --> 08:49.403
And so I've talked about my dad that he would also deliberately get himself shot because he lives on the front line and he just breaks and goes to the riverbank practically in the same position as that scene from his movie and goes to Iran shouting to the shotgun so they shook him down because he could not stand it.

08:49.383 --> 08:56.234
Come on, I have to leave.

08:56.254 --> 08:57.476
I'll be there.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.579
I'm sorry I stole him from you.

08:59.599 --> 09:01.482
No, no, it's okay.

09:01.502 --> 09:04.146
I'm going to give you a call, right?

09:04.166 --> 09:06.670
Did you know him when he was on Saturday April?

09:06.690 --> 09:06.750
No.

09:06.950 --> 09:22.309
I met him in Barcelona where we held a conference held by UNESCO on the cooperation on higher education in Bosnia-Segovina.

09:23.150 --> 09:35.960
But I'm amazing.

09:35.980 --> 09:36.381
Amazing personality.

09:36.401 --> 09:36.501
Yeah.

09:36.521 --> 09:38.325
Well, he actually works in the same city that I do, and I've never met him before tonight.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.067
So we're going to talk a little bit.

09:39.087 --> 09:39.307
Absolutely.

09:39.327 --> 09:40.450
That's why it's so important not to lose the name of it.

09:40.598 --> 09:48.986
It's not Garfield yet in Boston, so we have a plenty of time.

09:49.126 --> 09:51.509
I got all right.

09:51.529 --> 09:52.109
How old are you, might I ask?

09:52.129 --> 09:53.270
Yes, you may.

09:53.290 --> 09:56.794
I was born on September 4th, 1956, which practically means I'm 40 years old.

09:56.814 --> 09:57.695
Okay.

09:57.775 --> 09:59.076
So happily married.

09:59.096 --> 10:02.279
Unfortunately, there are the children, but happily married.

10:02.339 --> 10:06.403
We were in the perfect harmony and love with my wife, please.

10:07.193 --> 10:12.580
She's named Marina and... Well...

10:13.049 --> 10:26.606
First time in the United States and... This is the first time he has... First thing to do is... Invitation to the White House.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.790
No one will do it, even my mother.

10:29.810 --> 10:30.450
Did that happen?

10:30.511 --> 10:30.651
Really?

10:30.671 --> 10:32.473
Yeah, that told me... I will show you the photograph.

10:32.493 --> 10:36.458
Have you been... So you've been to the White House or you've been invited to the White House?

10:36.478 --> 10:38.100
I was invited to the White House and meet the first lady.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.321
And have you done this already or is this sport coming?

10:39.341 --> 10:40.483
No, no, I've done it.

10:40.503 --> 10:40.643
Really?

10:41.112 --> 10:42.976
We'll go right here.

10:42.996 --> 10:44.378
Is that right?

10:45.220 --> 10:45.421
Yeah.

10:45.441 --> 10:46.523
It turns out.

10:46.543 --> 10:49.689
I don't think we're going to be able to get a table.

10:49.709 --> 10:50.110
All right.

10:50.130 --> 10:54.278
Well, there's no ball rolling, so we have a view to the...

10:55.152 --> 11:07.130
This action done by Jeff Riespour and Andra Sridermayev, who are a nice northern person, dedicated to this democracy.

11:07.151 --> 11:07.992
He's amazing.

11:08.012 --> 11:10.736
You know, I've spent a couple of hours with him.

11:10.756 --> 11:11.077
Definitely.

11:11.097 --> 11:20.571
I mean, we are inmate connected for almost three years, and this is the first opportunity to meet him, and I'm with Jeff Riesp.

11:20.591 --> 11:21.733
I mean, I'm in his home.

11:21.916 --> 11:28.884
He's dedicated, you know, he's committed to it.

11:28.904 --> 11:41.379
Yes, but those are the kind of intellectuals that really know what's happening.

11:41.539 --> 11:48.227
So, Harvard University Press promises books, I mean, two copies of their current production.

11:49.270 --> 11:56.279
I think I can do something for you with the Library of Congress, by the way.

11:56.439 --> 12:03.088
I was just talking to the Library of Congress, a similar thing, just two days ago.

12:03.168 --> 12:09.697
And also the head of the president of the New York Public Library, Paul McClare, is interested in doing something else off the camera.

12:09.777 --> 12:11.599
Yeah, but, you know, we now have the channel.

12:12.440 --> 12:26.056
Now the important thing is to remember all the people involved in this book business is the list of the duplicates of what's available.

12:26.076 --> 12:38.050
Must be the first step of our agreement because more or less people are collecting books without any clue.

12:38.190 --> 12:38.590
That's right.

12:38.610 --> 12:39.291
So we have at this point maybe 50.

12:39.423 --> 12:42.047
Yeah, 50 tons, definitely.

12:42.087 --> 12:44.311
50 what, I'm sorry?

12:44.351 --> 12:47.136
50 tons of useless material.

12:47.697 --> 12:50.602
Because they're trying to be helpful, but they're not doing anything.

12:50.622 --> 12:55.069
Yeah, it's a problem known in library science as the problem of the white elephant.

12:55.235 --> 13:03.423
What are you going to do with the donation?

13:03.523 --> 13:07.227
And they are giving you stuff that they don't want and that's no good.

13:07.247 --> 13:13.493
Absolutely, so if you are interested in the complete set of the volunteers, I am not faking this in the truth.

13:13.513 --> 13:15.375
I can prove it to you.

13:15.395 --> 13:24.043
If you need the complete set of the annual report of the Hawaii Agricultural Institute from

13:24.243 --> 13:29.209
1904 to 1931, please.

13:29.589 --> 13:30.390
Call me, right?

13:30.410 --> 13:31.131
Just call me.

13:31.291 --> 13:41.323
Oh, if you want the total run of annual reports of the Commonwealth of Australia, meaning all these provinces.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.045
What do these people think that you need?

13:43.486 --> 13:47.631
They think that you just want volumes, but that the content is irrelevant?

13:47.651 --> 13:48.712
That's ridiculous.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.195
That is the way

13:52.475 --> 14:07.571
You know, this is the way how it does operate, that you are not getting into the profession.

14:07.591 --> 14:12.676
So maybe money is what you need, is that right?

14:12.696 --> 14:15.999
Yeah, but you know, money can grow on the tree or the book on the roof.

14:16.019 --> 14:17.381
Yeah, there is money, though.

14:17.401 --> 14:19.543
I like to say, there's money available if it agrees with what they want, you know.

14:19.563 --> 14:20.524
Yeah, but from my experience, doing that work,

14:21.280 --> 14:34.436
The problem is the following one.

14:34.456 --> 14:48.452
From my experience working in the Ministry of Education, the Assistant Minister, it is not money that is so much important.

14:49.360 --> 14:58.151
It is the program and, you know, the public relations and the assessment of this program.

14:58.171 --> 15:04.198
You know, when you hit the target, money, they come one way or another.

15:04.218 --> 15:12.829
You know, he says to go straight here, so we're going to let him pass it.

15:15.372 --> 15:15.812
He said, wave goodbye.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.996
We went out of our way a little bit so I could get him on the way home.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.041
Go ahead, I'm sorry, money.

15:23.061 --> 15:27.247
Money is not a program that you've got a feasible program.

15:27.267 --> 15:40.925
But you know, all the time you are faced with the fact that people are offering the programs that are already good for some other countries, like Burundi, Botswana, Somalia.

15:40.986 --> 15:47.835
They just change the color, but not the content of it.

15:48.271 --> 16:06.477
That is why it's so important that people can pop, can really experience being there, just the smell, just to have a feeling, touch the light.

16:06.918 --> 16:13.167
I don't know, I'm not right about it, it's not right about it.

16:13.187 --> 16:14.108
Did you see the gate there?

16:14.128 --> 16:16.752
It said autos only and then there's a gate.

16:16.772 --> 16:17.653
That doesn't help me then.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.265
All right, I'm sorry, don't worry about it.

16:20.285 --> 16:23.912
Okay, we're on the way.

16:23.932 --> 16:25.915
You can have a cigarette if you like.

16:25.935 --> 16:28.700
So it's practically after four years.

16:31.846 --> 16:32.968
Receive, please.

16:32.988 --> 16:35.693
Got it.

16:35.713 --> 16:36.334
Thank you.

16:39.588 --> 17:02.758
After four years of doing most of the things with books, like immigration books, and doing these things with their post because I'm a professional librarian.

17:02.778 --> 17:04.701
After four years I met this beautiful lady and she presented me a list, first list of the books.

17:05.896 --> 17:27.570
So I definitely said, this is the right thing.

17:27.590 --> 17:28.912
This is the first time that I'm in possibility to pick and choose.

17:28.932 --> 17:31.096
I said, that is how all things are going on.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.760
So right now I'm establishing the Sabre Foundation, or Sabre Office, not Sabre Office, but a sister organization to Sabre in Bosnia.

17:35.883 --> 18:00.000
And my students at the department of librarianship will do all the process like field assessment, distribution, packing, packing receipts, keeping the records of the cargo as a part of their in-service training at the university.

18:00.335 --> 18:19.176
So I will use that opportunity to teach them how to handle the groups.

18:19.196 --> 18:22.680
And of course, I'm expecting a great deal not to be rich because it's worth an organization effort, but it has some kind of a different approach to the problem of the groups.

18:23.453 --> 18:43.059
or to the problem of how to get life into the university community.

18:43.079 --> 18:45.242
And then Harvard University Press promises that the history, in fact, two copies of all the books available.

18:45.863 --> 18:59.772
And yesterday, when I was given things to you, you know, people came across to the warehouse of Siwa.

18:59.792 --> 19:00.373
Do you see somebody watching?

19:00.393 --> 19:01.175
Oh, they were in a, down called Berlin.

19:01.195 --> 19:01.335
Berlin.

19:01.355 --> 19:01.616
Berlin, yeah.

19:01.636 --> 19:02.056
It looks like Berlin.

19:02.077 --> 19:02.337
Yeah, Berlin.

19:05.354 --> 19:21.584
It comes that there are some other university classes who will want to do the same kind of information.

19:21.604 --> 19:22.085
That's wonderful.

19:22.105 --> 19:25.271
Yeah, but he was surprised with the amount and the generous offer from, I think, Chicago or... I really don't know these... And that is wonderful.

19:25.291 --> 19:25.371
Yes.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.847
Sure.

19:30.867 --> 19:41.204
So she did not know at the moment how to handle it.

19:41.224 --> 19:44.830
She was quite nervous while we were back, while we were on our way from the warehouse to Cambridge.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.491
So I just said, it's no problem.

19:45.511 --> 19:46.172
You promised me six containers.

19:46.193 --> 19:47.435
But if it's fruitful for your organization, spread the action.

19:47.455 --> 19:48.977
So you will have the books.

19:48.997 --> 19:52.523
I mean, you will have the real variety of the books we are talking here about.

19:52.874 --> 20:03.009
more than 500 titles, but who knows how many copies.

20:03.029 --> 20:08.057
If this can be useful for you as a Saber Foundation, use the opportunity.

20:08.077 --> 20:10.360
I mean, here am I, first time in the United States and first address in the White House,

20:10.660 --> 20:38.997
north western gate i mean i will have the problem if no one catch me at the airport but i was aware of that fact and i attended silly parts to all of my friends and i said please please please could you please wait me at the airport because of the funny thing that might happen if my airplane is late so i will have to take a cab in order to to be at the entrance uh age 15.

20:39.567 --> 20:51.362
So I deleted the whole story stating, if not doing so, my email address will be camel at st.clinton.chism.gov.us.

20:51.382 --> 21:03.077
So tell me, was Mrs. Clinton sympathetic to your situation?

21:03.097 --> 21:05.560
Yes, absolutely.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.123
I was surprised with the attitude.

21:08.356 --> 21:29.941
She did my speech and pointed out that the importance of these, let's say, small projects, which are funded privately by various organizations.

21:29.961 --> 21:31.343
I mean, this is not a job of governmental organizations, to talk with

21:31.745 --> 21:54.972
a serious set of the very serious problems in Bosnia, like mine fields, for example.

21:54.992 --> 21:56.453
You know, there is definitely, there are three million of the land mines.

21:56.473 --> 21:56.894
Three million, sorry?

21:56.914 --> 21:57.194
Three million.

21:57.214 --> 21:57.495
Three million?

21:57.515 --> 21:57.615
Yeah.

21:57.635 --> 21:59.177
So practically, because the cleaning of the mine fields is quite inexpensive.

21:59.197 --> 21:59.657
It might take 20 years.

21:59.677 --> 21:59.777
Yeah.

21:59.797 --> 22:00.178
It might take more.

22:00.198 --> 22:00.418
Absolutely.

22:01.394 --> 22:23.025
But between now and 20 years, since the culture is clean of the minds, there is something that must be done.

22:23.045 --> 22:24.187
There is some kind of a program, we must take a practice.

22:24.207 --> 22:24.988
So it is one small thing, one of the...

22:25.205 --> 22:49.202
20 or 30 missing items on major streams of the growth of the country, I mean of the reconstruction of the country.

22:49.222 --> 22:51.465
And that's Madeleine Albright, she's really a marvelous personality, a very wise person, with a magazine speech.

22:55.225 --> 23:07.548
I don't know.

23:07.568 --> 23:08.009
It goes very smoothly.

23:08.029 --> 23:09.492
Some people believe myself that I was there, but I haven't heard of them.

23:09.512 --> 23:10.574
Now, you're 40 years old, I think you told me, right?

23:10.594 --> 23:10.694
Yeah.

23:10.714 --> 23:11.876
When the fire happened, I was supposed to say you were 36.

23:11.896 --> 23:12.297
Something like that.

23:12.317 --> 23:12.577
So, whatever.

23:12.597 --> 23:12.998
But for a young man,

23:13.315 --> 23:27.148
Tell me what you felt when you started out in life as a professional person.

23:27.168 --> 23:28.632
Did you think that at the age of 40 that this is what you're doing today?

23:28.652 --> 23:28.712
No.

23:28.732 --> 23:30.396
First of all, I have an enormous sense of guilt with my wife because I lied to her.

23:31.388 --> 23:54.081
In fact, I lied to myself that this madness will be over in the 50 days.

23:54.101 --> 23:54.382
50 days, yeah.

23:54.402 --> 23:55.083
That is what I've done to my life.

23:55.103 --> 23:56.184
Believe me, Marina, this will be ended in the 50 days.

23:56.204 --> 23:57.166
And this is about when, when you're saying this?

23:57.186 --> 23:57.566
I'd say April 1992.

23:57.586 --> 23:57.687
Okay.

23:57.707 --> 23:58.628
So I was wrong because before the war I was...

23:59.840 --> 24:19.280
I was not a public person.

24:19.300 --> 24:22.163
I didn't hold it just in the ministry.

24:22.183 --> 24:22.863
I was just... Your life was books.

24:22.883 --> 24:25.106
My life was books and I was some kind of a homegrown dinosaur.

24:25.126 --> 24:26.027
My wife and the library... What is all about?

24:26.047 --> 24:27.288
I spent endless hours in the library writing on my PhD thesis.

24:27.308 --> 24:27.708
Where did you write?

24:27.728 --> 24:28.069
On my PhD thesis.

24:28.089 --> 24:28.429
And definitely...

24:30.468 --> 24:32.830
take care of my life.

24:34.012 --> 24:35.073
And the home.

24:35.173 --> 24:38.536
I didn't read daily newspaper.

24:38.556 --> 24:43.622
I wasn't able to politics, not part of the home or any party, you know.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.964
You're a librarian.

24:45.984 --> 24:46.405
I'm just a librarian.

24:46.425 --> 24:51.690
And then the things happened the way they happened.

24:51.710 --> 24:56.255
In fact, they dropped me.

24:56.275 --> 24:56.736
They what?

24:57.296 --> 24:58.237
They dropped me.

24:58.317 --> 25:00.019
Well, they drafted you for the army.

25:00.522 --> 25:03.927
Not for the area, thanks God for the Ministry of Defence.

25:04.488 --> 25:27.205
But my job was also to take care of parts of the collections, military collections of documents and some portions of the library that could be in the city.

25:27.387 --> 25:39.021
And after they just simply drafted me to the Ministry of Education to do what I was going to do.

25:39.041 --> 25:47.411
So I joined the Ministry of Education in January 1994 when Hari Sarajis was elected to be a Prime Minister.

25:47.431 --> 25:54.019
So we have a wonderful time and lots of time to discuss the key issue, what we're going to do.

25:54.303 --> 26:17.693
in a more than desperate situation when your country is under total bankruptcy, when you have officially authority to take care, to maintain all the things which is under your auspicious, but you do not have the means to do this and to envisage some kind of a future of possible solutions.

26:17.713 --> 26:22.058
So, it was quite an interesting episode of what I like.

26:22.739 --> 26:24.141
More or less I'm

26:24.830 --> 26:27.615
I learned a lot, that's the first thing.

26:27.815 --> 26:31.121
And the second thing, we achieved a lot.

26:31.141 --> 26:42.881
We achieved a lot because we were crazy enough to think strategically in the times of the war, which is not a good thing.

26:42.901 --> 26:47.850
War is something that totally shakes all the structures.

26:50.125 --> 26:55.772
What did you do your PhD on?

26:56.493 --> 26:58.736
My PhD is very specific.

27:00.298 --> 27:06.326
Basically, it's an information science, a simple field called bibliometrics.

27:06.346 --> 27:11.813
I invented and I produced

27:13.261 --> 27:25.437
Science citation index for the field of archaeology of Bosnia.

27:26.177 --> 27:43.099
Just to get the exact numbers and figures and patterns, charts, maps, diagrams, what is the actual information flow in historical scientific science?

27:43.923 --> 28:09.981
On the basis of this statistical result, I try to develop some kind of a political system, an expert system for the museum, meaning how to connect, how to link various information sources like library, like collections, like documentation, like

28:10.923 --> 28:37.285
cadastres like maps into a system that will provide you sufficient information as a background reading before you go to the specific site to dig and what are your obligations after you did your digging as an archaeologist so you were pure scholar absolutely but unfortunately

28:38.767 --> 28:58.429
I do not have the time and the need to continue my research in that area but in the meantime I discovered in my library and museum some manuscripts that are unknown to the public and I tried to

28:59.033 --> 29:02.899
making some kind of a hobby.

29:02.959 --> 29:05.263
I made some kind of a lucky lady.

29:05.283 --> 29:06.064
Lucky lady.

29:06.084 --> 29:12.013
And it's all prior to the catastrophe in 1992.

29:12.674 --> 29:20.826
Maybe five days before all started in Sarajevo, I discovered a manuscript that was considered to be lost.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.269
And that is an amazing story.

29:22.769 --> 29:26.475
It's a Bosnian-Serbian author from the city of Moscow.

29:26.928 --> 29:29.711
Mostar in Herzegovina.

29:30.913 --> 29:44.828
So I retyped the whole manuscript in my computer and my wife always made complaints stating to whom are you typing this manuscript?

29:44.849 --> 29:52.277
It's a Serbian author from the city of Mostar who is over, who is on the siege of the Croatian forces.

29:52.814 --> 30:02.546
I said, maybe this war will be ended soon and it will be a hit.

30:03.667 --> 30:09.594
Unknown drama, three acts, totally unknown manuscripts.

30:09.614 --> 30:14.180
Accidentally I found it because it was folded in some other envelope.

30:14.260 --> 30:15.261
That's a great story.

30:16.270 --> 30:17.732
And how large is it, physically?

30:18.012 --> 30:30.306
Physically, it's a normal free-act drama, 72 pages of a manuscript, practically less than 60 pages of a typescript.

30:30.386 --> 30:34.551
What is the significance of it, would you say, historically?

30:34.571 --> 30:43.481
Okay, a new volume to the complete volume of one of the most productive and most beautiful authors, Bosnian-Serbian authors.

30:43.822 --> 30:44.662
Authors?

30:45.003 --> 30:46.024
Yeah, writers.

30:46.358 --> 30:50.644
This is for the tape, so when I can... Go ahead, I'm sorry.

30:52.146 --> 30:57.254
So I added another volume to his complete volume.

30:57.534 --> 30:58.676
And what's his name once more?

30:59.717 --> 31:01.039
Svetozar Chorovic.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.002
So you didn't tell me that.

31:03.022 --> 31:03.903
How would I spell that?

31:04.103 --> 31:09.531
S-V-E-T.

31:09.882 --> 31:29.287
And I'll be able to find this too.

31:29.468 --> 31:32.371
So this was a very significant find then, wasn't it?

31:32.752 --> 31:35.215
Yes, but that happened.

31:35.870 --> 31:38.834
week before it all started, but on the very same day.

31:38.854 --> 31:40.076
This was a week before?

31:40.136 --> 31:53.655
Yes, it was 1st of April, for example, and all started on 6th, April 6th, with those riots and demonstrations in front of the House of the Parliament and the first sniper shooting in the city.

31:54.516 --> 32:05.151
But on the very day, this is also the tragic story, on the very day when all had happened, I was in the museum and discovered another set of the manuscripts.

32:05.317 --> 32:13.050
These are the manuscripts of the folk songs from the First World War.

32:13.551 --> 32:16.716
Really?

32:16.736 --> 32:21.224
So like I was predicting that there would be another war.

32:21.244 --> 32:24.910
Jeez, I just hit him.

32:24.930 --> 32:27.274
That car just hit back.

32:27.659 --> 32:32.787
So were these items saved or were they lost in the war?

32:32.827 --> 32:36.772
No, no, I just took them to my place, did the retyping.

32:37.153 --> 32:38.415
So they were saved?

32:38.435 --> 32:39.717
Yeah, they were saved.

32:39.737 --> 32:41.900
Because you took them home to retype them?

32:41.920 --> 32:47.188
Yes, I just retyped them and then returned them to the museum.

32:47.208 --> 32:55.540
But you know, if I search for these items for ten years, there is no way that I can find them.

32:56.296 --> 33:01.866
But the silly thing that I had to evacuate all my collections, you know.

33:01.886 --> 33:07.898
I had to pick all this stuff and, you know.

33:07.918 --> 33:09.180
So tell me where you're going now.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.162
We're at Harvard Square.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.348
No, in any corner, it's a fine, wherever you can stop.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.652
No, no, no, well, I'll just... I'm in Aurora Street.

33:15.752 --> 33:17.355
It's 20 meters from here.

33:17.816 --> 33:18.437
Are you sure?

33:18.598 --> 33:19.840
On the Broadway.

33:20.056 --> 33:25.069
Well, then just, I can take you to where you're going, so why don't I just... I'm sorry, just drop it here, I don't know.

33:25.249 --> 33:26.813
Okay.

33:28.458 --> 33:30.022
I'll just pull over.

33:30.042 --> 33:30.663
Is this okay?

33:31.064 --> 33:31.606
Yes.

33:31.626 --> 33:32.588
You're sure?

33:32.608 --> 33:32.829
Absolutely.

33:32.849 --> 33:33.411
Right over here?

33:33.932 --> 33:34.774
Yes, yes, sir.

33:37.589 --> 33:40.473
Well, this has been such a great pleasure for me.

33:40.653 --> 33:44.999
I'm sorry you weren't comfortable in the front seat.

33:45.079 --> 33:46.381
And I'll be in touch, okay?

33:46.401 --> 33:51.488
I'll send you some e-mail, and we'll communicate, and I'll come visit you.

33:51.509 --> 33:51.749
Okay.

33:52.109 --> 33:57.837
Thank you very much for the opportunity to talk to you, and thank you for the lunch.

33:57.857 --> 33:58.278
Thank you.

33:58.298 --> 33:58.879
Good luck.

33:59.119 --> 33:59.580
Bye-bye.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.584
...where you can put out a call and get one of...
