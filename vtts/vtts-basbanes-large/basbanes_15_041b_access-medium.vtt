WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:03.193
Okay, we're on again.

00:05.855 --> 00:07.817
Page 307, is it?

00:07.998 --> 00:20.410
Page 307, where you describe so powerfully that first hiding mound, you know, at the airport.

00:20.431 --> 00:30.561
And there's a wonderful line there where you say, you knew you must flee or walk into a doom beyond all knowing.

00:31.587 --> 00:41.520
And there's this sense here that you had a sense of certainly the unknown, but doom.

00:41.540 --> 00:54.836
And I wonder, here we have the one time radical intellectual on the one hand, the sex perceived sex goddess on the other.

00:54.856 --> 00:57.780
Did you ever kind of perceive or see yourself

00:58.368 --> 01:00.792
That's two characters in a play.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.195
I mean, are we talking about characters?

01:03.355 --> 01:03.956
No.

01:04.437 --> 01:06.220
We're reaching a little too far, right?

01:07.221 --> 01:11.067
Well, that may seem to you, but... I mean, I'm reaching too far.

01:11.087 --> 01:12.809
Oh, yeah.

01:12.829 --> 01:14.552
We're just really talking about relationships.

01:14.572 --> 01:16.755
No human being feels he's a character in a play.

01:19.239 --> 01:22.884
No human being I ever heard of.

01:22.904 --> 01:26.890
He's just living his life.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.501
I'm not going to pick up too much fun.

01:33.521 --> 01:35.824
Well, good, because I have to.

01:35.844 --> 01:37.005
One other question.

01:37.225 --> 01:38.266
One other question.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.348
Death is so central in your work.

01:41.349 --> 01:45.113
Do you consider yourself a writer of tragedy, per se?

01:45.293 --> 01:46.794
Well, I would like to.

01:46.834 --> 02:00.808
It's a condition that applies to all of us.

02:02.189 --> 02:08.181
However, I found in recent years that it takes less and less of the center.

02:08.201 --> 02:14.473
It moves off from the center away from the center of my work.

02:14.493 --> 02:24.332
And I suspect it's because I get closer to it with each decade.

02:27.451 --> 02:27.972
I don't know.

02:28.132 --> 02:37.784
I think that in the future, something I'm working on now would probably complete the circle back to a tragic moment again.

02:39.567 --> 02:42.751
But it's hard to rationalize these things.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.172
I work by instinct a lot.

02:45.274 --> 02:46.335
I'm not a philosopher.

02:48.959 --> 02:53.965
I follow my nose, as this book indicates.

02:54.637 --> 02:59.926
I mean you can see from the book that it's not a, I haven't laid out a plot.

03:01.087 --> 03:02.209
It's instinctive.

03:02.229 --> 03:02.970
But there is a plot.

03:03.331 --> 03:06.736
There is, but it discovers itself, so to speak.

03:06.757 --> 03:08.259
It's not preordained.

03:08.279 --> 03:10.242
And your plays apparently did that as well.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.486
That's right.

03:13.147 --> 03:14.990
And yet there is a beginning, a middle, and an end.

03:15.771 --> 03:19.497
Well, if there isn't I don't complete them.

03:20.962 --> 03:27.288
I also start writing plays that don't end, but I don't publish them.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.550
And do they go on the desk to gather desks?

03:29.590 --> 03:30.030
Yeah.

03:30.650 --> 03:32.732
They stay in the notebook.

03:32.812 --> 03:38.037
A play without an end is not a play yet.

03:39.298 --> 03:43.282
It's something that's not quite born.

03:43.442 --> 03:46.404
My point is you don't go back to it though?

03:46.424 --> 03:50.648
Not usually, no.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.228
I can't redo something.

03:53.248 --> 03:54.670
I have to do it fresh.

03:54.690 --> 03:56.934
I get the excitement of a fresh discovery.

03:58.116 --> 04:00.160
You have to be moved.

04:00.180 --> 04:00.701
Exactly.

04:01.342 --> 04:06.831
If I'm not moved, I can't make anybody else see anything or feel anything.

04:06.851 --> 04:10.437
It's my excitement that I have to convey.

04:10.457 --> 04:13.362
You don't see this as entertainment either, I think.

04:13.679 --> 04:15.702
Well, it's a different form of entertainment.

04:15.722 --> 04:27.661
It's not entertainment as an evasion of existence, but an entertainment of finding existence and finding some new light on it.

04:28.061 --> 04:30.545
That's entertainment.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.271
But art has to have a purpose beyond entertainment.

04:35.613 --> 04:37.956
Well, yeah, but there you get on slippery ground.

04:38.017 --> 04:40.260
I don't want people to think that I am

04:41.371 --> 04:47.096
a moralist in the sense that I think everything has to improve human race.

04:47.817 --> 04:50.139
But it's nice to have a catharsis every once in a while.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.301
Well, that's the issue.

04:52.321 --> 04:54.143
That's the issue, really.

04:54.163 --> 05:08.997
Whether you can draw seemingly unrelated elements together into a new relationship that explodes on the stage with some illumination.

05:09.017 --> 05:09.758
That's the idea.

05:10.649 --> 05:16.177
The illumination is the idea, is the hope.

05:16.197 --> 05:20.022
Are you as politically involved, in your mind at least?

05:21.284 --> 05:29.475
Yeah, I think politics is in the web of life.

05:30.737 --> 05:33.561
Without politics we have only violence.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.124
We better have politics.

05:37.666 --> 05:40.470
A country without politics is a country.

05:41.395 --> 05:43.777
rule by a dictator.

05:46.059 --> 05:53.426
And so, because I value my freedom, I have to pay attention to politics.

05:53.446 --> 05:57.529
As a Greek, I have to ask you a question, and maybe that's it.

05:57.669 --> 06:00.352
But is this an irreparable...?

06:01.793 --> 06:02.314
I don't know.

06:02.414 --> 06:06.637
I've seen him in recent years, sometimes.

06:07.058 --> 06:10.761
In my book, I'm simply describing what happened.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.374
I don't hold any animus against him.

06:15.394 --> 06:18.437
I haven't for many long times.

06:18.457 --> 06:21.280
But it was a historical event.

06:21.961 --> 06:23.343
There was no way.

06:23.363 --> 06:26.346
And decisions were made to go one way or the other.

06:26.566 --> 06:27.427
That's right.

06:28.288 --> 06:41.963
But I have often said that everybody got so personal about the whole thing that it was about what the issues were.

06:43.613 --> 06:59.540
The issue was that no artist, nobody, not just artist, should be snatched off the street and dragged into a government office to be pilloried like that.

07:00.341 --> 07:03.106
And on a fishing expedition?

07:03.126 --> 07:03.567
Absolutely.

07:03.587 --> 07:05.630
Just throwing the hook in the water and seeing what bites.

07:05.751 --> 07:08.355
What earthly?

07:08.757 --> 07:12.681
You know, your point is, are we dealing with some legislation?

07:13.001 --> 07:15.163
Are we trying to formulate a bill?

07:15.183 --> 07:17.645
Well, finally, that became the law, you see.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.967
My position finally became the law.

07:21.269 --> 07:27.154
And it's a pity that it hadn't become the law before.

07:27.815 --> 07:31.558
It would have saved a lot of unnecessary summary.

07:31.578 --> 07:35.862
That was quite a case that you reminded me of in here, by the way, with Aladdin, Connecticut.

07:36.095 --> 07:39.680
who was browbeaten into that confession.

07:39.881 --> 07:43.706
There was a TV thing on that some time.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.709
They never solved that crime, did they?

07:46.671 --> 07:52.139
We just had a dreadful crime up in the North County of a woman and her tooth.

07:52.439 --> 07:56.605
I was just listening to the news on it this morning.

07:56.625 --> 08:03.315
A 33-year-old woman, a 7-year-old son, a 7-year-old daughter, a 5-year-old son, brutally murdered.

08:03.496 --> 08:03.756
All of them?

08:04.597 --> 08:11.047
The father came home from, he's a lawyer, discovered them by 20, Tuesday after day.

08:11.067 --> 08:16.575
They've got a warrant out there looking for a 17-year-old kid who left a trail a mile wide.

08:16.635 --> 08:17.857
But anyway, I'm sorry.

08:17.877 --> 08:18.798
You shot him?

08:18.818 --> 08:20.441
If you've got the Globe, it's in this morning.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.042
Oh yeah.

08:21.062 --> 08:21.983
It's the front page.

08:22.424 --> 08:24.026
I forget the Globe.

08:24.346 --> 08:25.368
Yeah, this is the Globe.

08:25.388 --> 08:29.054
Well, the front page story at the bottom anyway.

08:29.154 --> 08:31.397
It's a dreadful story.

08:31.664 --> 08:38.593
But anyway, that was a very interesting case, which is not, you know, to try and get, that was non-political as far as you were concerned.

08:38.633 --> 08:43.220
It was a human rights thing.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.922
The kid gets rude, basically.

08:45.403 --> 08:45.563
Yeah.

08:46.044 --> 08:49.588
Well, happens, I guess, a lot.

08:49.608 --> 08:49.949
I'm afraid.

08:51.191 --> 08:51.912
Wrap up.

08:51.952 --> 08:52.272
Yeah.
