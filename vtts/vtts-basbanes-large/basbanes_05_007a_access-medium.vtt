WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:06.848
And we're rolling, and we're talking to Bill Holman in Austin, Texas.

00:06.888 --> 00:11.033
Now, it's on, so if you ever want me to shut it off, tell me, okay?

00:11.373 --> 00:15.658
But otherwise, it's on, unless otherwise indicated.

00:15.678 --> 00:27.533
So, you know, let's explain how you and I get to know each other, and it's a telephone friendship right now, and I sure hope at some point we can meet face-to-face and shake hands.

00:28.954 --> 00:29.515
Yeah.

00:29.714 --> 00:38.226
You know, I'm working on a chapter for a new book that will include some attention to the San Francisco Public Library.

00:38.346 --> 00:42.012
And you worked there for a number of years.

00:43.214 --> 00:45.517
You took over the job in the 60s, right?

00:45.537 --> 00:48.381
In 1960, I stayed in 67.

00:48.361 --> 00:54.516
So that was, and I'm looking at one of the San Francisco Chronicle stories that you sent me.

00:54.556 --> 01:04.902
They credited you with bringing, you know, this library into the 20th century, combining technological know-how, astute political maneuvering.

01:04.882 --> 01:06.745
etc., etc., delivery.

01:07.305 --> 01:17.961
So did you, you know, is that, did you, was that one of your goals to bring the library into the, let's open this with a very general, we'll enter the conversation.

01:18.061 --> 01:18.442
How's that?

01:19.163 --> 01:19.743
That's fine.

01:21.025 --> 01:33.403
Nick, I think my major objective was reorganizing the library because it was an entire situation at that time in terms of staff, personnel, book collections.

01:33.738 --> 01:38.647
and the technical control over its book collection.

01:39.188 --> 01:56.700
The thing is the library has to have bibliographical control over its collections, or otherwise you'd come in and check the catalog, and you'd put a slip-in for a book, and usually six times out of ten the book wouldn't be there, and it wouldn't be checked out.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.501
They couldn't find it.

01:57.886 --> 02:04.256
And so that was one of the things, was trying to get the cataloging system in control.

02:04.276 --> 02:07.781
The second thing was hiring professional staff.

02:08.643 --> 02:18.538
And up until that time, there was a rather uneven pattern of retaining personnel.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.108
San Francisco is a very interesting city, and the library had gone through years of

02:25.612 --> 02:33.822
restless involvement with political overhangings that didn't nourish it for its good.

02:36.065 --> 02:45.917
And so I think that was a major thing is to actually someone had to come in and actually take over the library and administer it and control it without political influence.

02:48.761 --> 02:49.041
Okay.

02:49.922 --> 02:50.703
I'm just reading here.

02:50.723 --> 02:52.326
I noticed that you worked for Harry Ransom?

02:53.066 --> 02:54.328
Yes, I worked for Harry.

02:54.368 --> 02:55.129
I came here

02:55.430 --> 02:57.793
to the Humanities Research Center.

02:57.813 --> 03:00.016
I was at the Humanities Research Center Library later.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.179
Did you see my book, A Gentle Madness?

03:02.560 --> 03:03.161
Yes.

03:03.181 --> 03:05.644
Did you see the chapter I wrote on the HRC?

03:05.664 --> 03:06.906
Yes, yeah.

03:06.946 --> 03:12.553
That's one of the great libraries of contemporary literature, you know.

03:12.574 --> 03:13.335
Yeah.

03:14.296 --> 03:15.918
And Harry was a very unique person.

03:15.938 --> 03:20.965
He was a man that had a vision of 100 years in advance.

03:21.468 --> 03:28.139
And also he had the astuteness to act on his vision, and he had the courage to act on his vision.

03:28.780 --> 03:41.620
So many administrators in large university systems can have the vision, but many of them don't have the courage to act because of fear of political happenings that would come from the office.

03:41.887 --> 03:43.389
Now, it's pretty interesting here.

03:43.729 --> 03:45.591
I'm reading this piece in the Chronicle.

03:45.631 --> 03:46.893
They loved you out there.

03:47.013 --> 03:47.974
I mean, you got along.

03:48.014 --> 03:53.581
It seems that they were sick about your leaving, and you got along well.

03:54.782 --> 04:01.310
What a stark contrast between your experience and the one with Kenneth Dowling.

04:01.751 --> 04:07.117
Well, I think, you know, I have a theory, and Harry Ransom and I discussed this, about ministrators.

04:07.838 --> 04:11.202
I think ministrators, they have a butterfly gift.

04:11.637 --> 04:12.017
life.

04:12.798 --> 04:14.460
They come out of the cocoon.

04:15.241 --> 04:25.371
And they, a good administrator knows when to turn over every, normally I think your positive influence as administrator is in the first three years.

04:26.633 --> 04:34.060
Then the next three years you try to consolidate your gains and smooth out and smooth your administrative step.

04:34.321 --> 04:38.505
At the end of five to eight years, I think your administrative

04:38.907 --> 04:42.431
is rather negated and you shouldn't have gone.

04:43.552 --> 04:44.653
I believe this sincerely.

04:45.374 --> 04:51.141
And I think that, for example, I love to go in and reorganize the library.

04:51.842 --> 05:03.835
After it got to a certain level, I would rather become not bored, but I wouldn't become as assertive and as effective as I was during the first three to five years.

05:04.523 --> 05:06.225
And this is the main thing that happened.

05:06.265 --> 05:10.809
I was director of the San Antonio Public Library before San Francisco.

05:11.650 --> 05:18.596
And then I'd been director of the Rosenberg Library in Galveston, which is one of the fine, small libraries in the United States.

05:18.656 --> 05:21.499
At one time, it was the finest library in Texas.

05:21.699 --> 05:21.979
Really?

05:22.660 --> 05:24.601
Now what made it one of the finest?

05:24.742 --> 05:27.484
Well, Rosenberg endowed that library early on.

05:27.644 --> 05:28.705
It was a larger library.

05:28.745 --> 05:33.990
Galveston was the real cultural center of Texas for years.

05:34.493 --> 05:38.419
and was finally overtaken by Houston and Dallas.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.422
But up in that time, he endowed that library.

05:41.023 --> 05:46.572
I'd say it's the finest, unique administrative organization I've ever worked in.

05:47.273 --> 05:52.461
It was a board that controlled the library that was independent of the county and the city.

05:53.082 --> 05:59.792
And I remember when I was interviewed, I asked Bill Morgan, I said, well, you know, I report to the board, and I said, to whom do you report?

06:00.025 --> 06:01.807
And Bill Morgan said, we report to God.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.790
And we're the final act around here.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.732
That's funny.

06:07.012 --> 06:08.594
It is a great library to work for.

06:08.614 --> 06:09.795
Absolutely incredible.

06:10.255 --> 06:12.918
You wouldn't believe it.

06:12.978 --> 06:18.143
Galveston, many of the men there were graduates from universities like Virginia.

06:18.844 --> 06:25.611
It had the very, very smooth, aristocratic type of old southern men there.

06:26.832 --> 06:28.834
Many people wouldn't recognize that, but it's true.

06:29.843 --> 06:31.106
Who was Rosenberg?

06:31.547 --> 06:39.143
Rosenberg was a banker there and a large investor, and he left the Rosenberg Library as an endowment.

06:39.564 --> 06:49.185
A large orphanage was there in his name, and he was a very influential person in the history of early Galveston.

06:49.655 --> 06:52.559
But it's interesting that he cared about a public library, isn't it?

06:52.659 --> 06:53.020
Yes.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.542
And it's a beautiful building.

06:54.562 --> 06:55.804
Oh, gorgeous.

06:55.824 --> 06:56.785
And how are the collections?

06:57.246 --> 06:57.747
Oh, great.

06:58.027 --> 06:58.968
Fantastic collections.

06:59.028 --> 07:03.515
In Texas at one time, it was the finest collection in it.

07:03.535 --> 07:07.080
And the history of the Southwest is probably the finest.

07:07.481 --> 07:12.327
I know I gave a collection there on small voyages.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.110
I've always been interested in sailing.

07:14.663 --> 07:19.069
And I've sailed out to Bermuda and sailed in the Bahamas around eight years.

07:19.550 --> 07:23.094
My wife lived down in Bahamas and had her own boat.

07:23.115 --> 07:25.998
So you've had a lot of experience with public libraries.

07:26.519 --> 07:28.201
Well, I've had that.

07:28.221 --> 07:36.192
I was one of those fortunate, Nick, that when I graduated, the opportunities were so available.

07:36.673 --> 07:44.063
And I'd gone into pre-law at the University of Oklahoma, but when I took a course in bibliography,

07:44.482 --> 07:53.572
My teacher encouraged me to go into library science and she said that law was not the profession I should go in.

07:54.593 --> 07:59.738
She said there's a Lawyer Forever telephone post in Oklahomaville.

07:59.758 --> 08:01.820
That's funny.

08:02.801 --> 08:04.223
She was a very distinguished teacher.

08:05.484 --> 08:10.810
You know, a lot of my attention in this new book is about this whole concept of book culture.

08:11.262 --> 08:15.027
and the role the public library plays in this equation.

08:15.789 --> 08:26.244
The library, in my mind, is one of the few institutions that hasn't abdicated its mission.

08:27.265 --> 08:27.846
It has not.

08:27.886 --> 08:28.927
No, it has not.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.430
Even though it's changed dramatically.

08:30.450 --> 08:39.503
It's changed dramatically, but it still has that mission that's the very center and core of the thrust of its being.

08:39.523 --> 08:41.185
But when you...

08:42.717 --> 08:44.640
How do I phrase this?

08:44.660 --> 08:49.629
Do you see the public library serving a function as a research institution?

08:50.190 --> 08:52.154
Well, in a metropolitan area, I do.

08:53.737 --> 09:01.631
I think this is the difference of my view and other later administrations' view in San Francisco.

09:01.651 --> 09:02.152
Exactly.

09:02.793 --> 09:03.735
So you see where I'm going.

09:04.235 --> 09:07.341
It's a very large metropolitan center.

09:07.591 --> 09:10.538
of very eclectic tastes and innards.

09:10.558 --> 09:11.359
Eclectic?

09:11.379 --> 09:11.680
Yes.

09:12.341 --> 09:12.442
Yeah.

09:12.462 --> 09:17.032
And, for example, my theory is to buy collections like Harry.

09:17.994 --> 09:24.368
If you're a library and you're weak in a certain area and you find a collection, let's say, like I did in San Francisco on mountain climbing,

09:24.618 --> 09:25.079
You buy it.

09:26.040 --> 09:26.821
You buy everything is.

09:26.841 --> 09:30.446
There may be three duplicates out of 100 books, but so what?

09:30.647 --> 09:33.291
All right, so you would buy this, and you did buy such a collection?

09:33.511 --> 09:33.771
Yes.

09:34.593 --> 09:36.615
And how many volumes that were there in that collection?

09:36.636 --> 09:38.759
Oh, I imagine, you know, here I, Nick, I'm going by them.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.061
I know, but just approximately.

09:40.081 --> 09:41.783
I'd say there was 100 volumes.

09:41.763 --> 09:49.479
And would it concern you, if nobody read one of those books for three or four or five years?

09:49.519 --> 09:50.642
That's fine.

09:50.662 --> 09:51.423
That's okay with you?

09:51.484 --> 09:52.325
That's fine with me.

09:52.345 --> 09:59.721
And if they didn't, would you, if one of your staff came forward and said, Mr. Holman...

09:59.701 --> 10:03.928
Nobody's using these books, and we don't know if anyone's going to use them in the next 10 years.

10:05.050 --> 10:09.597
We think that because we have such tight space, maybe we should deaccession these books.

10:09.617 --> 10:10.639
What would your reaction be?

10:10.659 --> 10:16.288
Well, I would say then come forth with me a critical evaluation of this collection of 100 books.

10:16.309 --> 10:20.335
The authorities on mountaineering, which of the 50 would you keep?

10:20.516 --> 10:22.058
Or which of the 75 would you keep?

10:22.078 --> 10:22.899
What if they said none?

10:23.761 --> 10:26.265
Well, then, if they're all really terrible books,

10:26.617 --> 10:29.200
I would probably eradicate them.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.204
Well, I'm not even saying that they're terrible.

10:32.244 --> 10:33.986
Maybe they're wonderful, but nobody's using them.

10:34.146 --> 10:37.611
That seems to be one of the criteria that people are applying here these days.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.675
Nick, I see that's been applied for years.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.557
It's nothing new.

10:43.378 --> 10:48.064
When I'm in library school, they said, well, you discard all these books, you'll have them on microfilm.

10:48.865 --> 10:49.806
Well, good luck.

10:50.427 --> 10:52.610
You read the microfilm copies.

10:52.630 --> 10:55.334
And I don't think they do put all these books on microfilm anyway.

10:55.575 --> 10:56.816
That's a myth.

10:56.876 --> 11:01.844
In these metropolitan areas, that this is what they say, they never use them, is not true.

11:03.206 --> 11:09.255
That there's always these people out here, just like I was just avidly interested in sailing.

11:09.275 --> 11:09.775
Absolutely.

11:10.156 --> 11:18.308
Offshore sailing, that was my release, to get on a boat and sail out of San Francisco, sail down to L.A.,

11:18.878 --> 11:22.328
That, to me, rejuvenated my life for a year.

11:22.388 --> 11:24.835
I used to go to the Bahamas.

11:24.895 --> 11:33.360
I used to fly from San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale and go to the Riverbend Marina and say, maybe you had a boat down there you just bought.

11:33.661 --> 11:39.108
We're fixing it up, and I'd talk to you and ask if you wanted a crew, and you and I'd sail the bomb.

11:39.128 --> 11:40.570
Sounds like fun to me.

11:40.690 --> 11:43.755
For two weeks, and then I'd fly home and go to work.

11:44.275 --> 11:44.936
That's great.

11:45.016 --> 11:51.865
My wife understood that I needed those breaks because I work very intensely when I am work.

11:51.905 --> 11:53.788
But I do, I'm like a computer.

11:53.848 --> 11:56.472
I kind of get overloaded, and I have to run.

11:56.492 --> 12:00.597
And my answer to life is when you get overloaded, what do you do?

12:00.965 --> 12:01.486
Run.

12:02.727 --> 12:04.929
And then what do you do later?

12:04.949 --> 12:07.512
I used to have guilt complex about this.

12:07.532 --> 12:11.256
But Dr. Gordy said, well, Bill, what do you do after you're gone three to four or six weeks?

12:11.316 --> 12:12.617
I said, well, I come back and go to work.

12:13.338 --> 12:14.859
He said, that's what you should do.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.984
Now, were you mindfully building collections in San Francisco?

12:19.324 --> 12:20.125
Yes.

12:20.145 --> 12:21.006
You look in that book.

12:21.767 --> 12:22.928
I have it over here on the shelf.

12:23.188 --> 12:23.609
Just a minute.

12:23.629 --> 12:29.875
And I've got the book, too, so don't...

12:40.823 --> 12:48.291
If you look on page 172 to 173, the Grabhorn collection, we built that.

12:49.232 --> 12:52.816
I joined with a friend of the library and they pledged 5,000.

12:53.616 --> 12:55.679
And then what I did to buy that collection.

12:56.159 --> 12:59.823
See, all the librarians have excuses not to buy a collection.

12:59.843 --> 13:09.413
But here in one fell swoop you came up to be the major holdings of books and typography and printing and find bookmaking in the United States.

13:09.730 --> 13:12.113
when we bought the Grabhorn collection.

13:12.133 --> 13:24.346
And the way I bought that, you might say it could be illegal that I broke the books down and bought them on purchase orders just out of the regular book budget.

13:25.728 --> 13:29.812
And then the friends matched that amount and that way we acquired the collection.

13:29.832 --> 13:32.956
And why did you feel this collection was so necessary, so important?

13:33.396 --> 13:36.480
San Francisco has been the center of fine bookmaking in America.

13:37.741 --> 13:39.383
It is really the threshold

13:39.768 --> 13:50.523
of the most innovative and creative work done in printing, following the Grabhorns by Malette Dean, and you should see some of his books.

13:50.543 --> 14:00.436
And all the range of fine press and creative work in printing and imaginative work in printing has emanated from San Francisco.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.160
And there is where the culture...

14:03.646 --> 14:11.157
of fine typography, hand-set books, books printed on hand-made paper, later reproduced.

14:11.277 --> 14:14.122
Adrian Wilson's printing for the theater was done there.

14:14.702 --> 14:16.145
He was influenced by what?

14:16.185 --> 14:19.009
He was influenced by the Grabhorns.

14:19.029 --> 14:20.671
And so it's their derivative.

14:20.691 --> 14:22.915
It's like writers are derivatives from other writers.

14:23.656 --> 14:25.559
And the same is true as printing.

14:26.300 --> 14:31.307
Then also calligraphy, the Harrison collection, we...

14:31.658 --> 14:42.327
I talked Michael, Richard Harrison, into giving his collection and then we would, if he would add a book, then we would match that book.

14:42.347 --> 14:46.211
And then Eric Hoffer, have you read his book?

14:46.231 --> 14:47.452
Oh, very important, yeah.

14:47.472 --> 15:01.564
Okay, Eric Hoffer is a friend of mine and I talked him into leaving his manuscript collection to the San Francisco Public Library because he learned much of his work there in the San Francisco Public Library

15:02.000 --> 15:03.602
And he was a longshoreman there.

15:04.443 --> 15:08.028
And he read at the library sometimes at least three days a week.

15:08.209 --> 15:08.689
No kidding.

15:08.990 --> 15:17.441
And from that library came this mine to set down The True Believer, which is an important small book, I think, in the literature.

15:17.602 --> 15:18.883
What's the title of it once again, Bill?

15:18.903 --> 15:19.604
The True Believer.

15:20.866 --> 15:26.674
It's a very important book, Nick, on the understanding of what makes these people

15:27.667 --> 15:34.173
Follow this man on the white horse out into oblivion that would scar and cancer the world with a war.

15:35.314 --> 15:39.658
And it's a very small book.

15:39.678 --> 15:41.840
It's written with very lucid text.

15:42.581 --> 15:43.601
And it's an important piece.

15:44.102 --> 15:48.286
And you say that book came from basically from his work in Los San Francisco.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.810
You know, I'm writing a chapter on this, on readers and libraries.

15:52.850 --> 15:56.273
I'm seeing Alfred Kazin in New York on Thursday.

15:56.472 --> 15:57.513
Yeah.

15:57.534 --> 16:00.398
And, you know, it's of great interest to me.

16:00.418 --> 16:04.243
Shaw, Wolf from the British Library, Karl Marx.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.326
Karl Marx in the British Library.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.448
You know, all these people.

16:07.468 --> 16:12.395
Also Nikola Tesla, an alternating current, he came up with the idea when he was reading a book.

16:12.775 --> 16:14.438
Nikola Tesla?

16:14.558 --> 16:16.360
You know, the Italian physicist?

16:16.380 --> 16:17.242
Came up with?

16:17.522 --> 16:19.645
He came up with the idea of...

16:19.996 --> 16:22.539
alternating current when he was reading a book.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.382
How do you know this?

16:24.642 --> 16:27.525
I read it and I had notes on it for years.

16:27.545 --> 16:28.987
I read about that.

16:29.007 --> 16:35.976
I was going to write an article on books and influence that were direct.

16:36.677 --> 16:39.020
Boy, I'd love to see your notes on that.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.603
Nikola Tesla, T-E-S-L-A.

16:42.364 --> 16:44.687
And, you know, I wrote those back in the 50s.

16:45.055 --> 16:46.596
Now, Lord knows where they are now.

16:47.377 --> 16:49.359
Can you remember offhand any other examples?

16:50.720 --> 16:53.062
He was one of the most unique ones.

16:53.082 --> 16:59.108
Because I was always, as a boy, I was always interested in winding my own armatures and building motors.

17:00.169 --> 17:02.351
And so he was kind of impressed on my mind.

17:03.312 --> 17:07.216
But I think a library is like an individual.

17:07.296 --> 17:14.202
To have a personality, if you're a bird with a single note, you don't have

17:14.654 --> 17:21.744
much range or influence within your own bird world, so to speak.

17:22.425 --> 17:26.891
And the library, I think, has to have this wide range of tastes and interests.

17:27.072 --> 17:31.198
Now, I do believe that the branches should handle the popular books.

17:31.879 --> 17:39.209
In our interest there, we would lease the books and we'd rent them, so to speak, and have them in ample numbers for the public.

17:40.431 --> 17:43.395
But in the central library, we still have this reserve.

17:44.303 --> 18:08.297
Now, Nick, there is a possibility, let's say, in the next 20 years, that we'll get these CD-ROMs down whereby we can take, let's say, Book A that isn't read but once a year now, or once every five years, and put it on a CD-ROM, and then you can call for it on this mass of CD-ROMs, and I can pull it out and reprint the book for you within, you know, 20 minutes.

18:09.258 --> 18:10.800
Now, I think that's a possibility.

18:11.422 --> 18:13.406
And it's not remote.

18:13.606 --> 18:18.575
It is a possibility if you can get the technology around where it's cheap enough to do it.

18:19.757 --> 18:29.796
But at the present time, it's still not inexpensive enough to do it, first to get it on the CD-ROM, and then also to sell them or distribute them all to most of the major libraries.

18:29.816 --> 18:30.898
It's not possible.

18:33.055 --> 18:34.317
Very, very interesting.

18:34.597 --> 18:42.129
Now, when we chatted one of the last time before, you don't mind jumping around here on the conversation.

18:43.131 --> 18:44.954
Excuse me, my allergies are kicking in today.

18:46.236 --> 18:51.604
You said when you walked in for the first time to the new San Francisco Public Library,

18:52.040 --> 18:59.811
You said something, and I don't want to paraphrase, but you were concerned that, oh, my God, what have they done here?

19:02.174 --> 19:04.578
You were concerned that maybe this wasn't going to work.

19:04.598 --> 19:13.270
I don't know if I'm recollecting this, but maybe you could just tell me in your own words what happened.

19:13.350 --> 19:16.174
I went to the old library first.

19:16.728 --> 19:17.529
The Old Main.

19:17.749 --> 19:18.330
The Old Main.

19:19.351 --> 19:21.473
This is on a recent trip to San Francisco.

19:21.733 --> 19:23.455
This was, what, two years ago?

19:23.695 --> 19:24.296
Okay, so 95.

19:24.376 --> 19:36.207
Yeah, I think so, and I walked into the Old Main, and I walked upstairs to the Literature and Philosophy Literature Department, and I was aghast.

19:36.568 --> 19:43.815
They had closed the department, shut it down, and put the staff over in the general reference collection.

19:44.487 --> 19:57.701
And this was very disconcerting to me because here you are a metropolitan library system now, and one of the great cores of literature fall in literature and philosophy and religion.

19:58.582 --> 20:08.312
And say, for example, if you... I still believe that you have to have well-trained, well-read, articulate, and very able people at every desk.

20:09.273 --> 20:11.575
And say, for example, you walk in, as I did,

20:12.061 --> 20:15.344
And I asked, and I just went over as a test case.

20:16.185 --> 20:20.209
And I said, well... And nobody knew who you were, by the way, right?

20:20.289 --> 20:22.732
Nobody knew who I was.

20:23.172 --> 20:38.448
I walked over there and I said, I'm writing an autobiography and a memoir, and can you give me references to, say, four to six important books on contemporary writing and memoirs in the English language?

20:38.468 --> 20:38.608
Mm-hmm.

20:40.175 --> 20:41.196
God, it's dead silence.

20:42.418 --> 20:42.678
You know?

20:43.939 --> 20:59.497
Now, anyone in the literature, philosophy, and religion department that's trained and well-read would know that, say, like Russell Baker's growing up, his great classic in American letters, or Conroy's Stop Time, or I don't know if you've ever read T.S.

20:59.517 --> 21:00.758
Pritchett's Cab at the Door.

21:01.699 --> 21:03.341
He's one of the great... He's wonderful.

21:03.561 --> 21:04.843
Short stories and essays.

21:04.863 --> 21:05.243
Oh, yeah.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.747
His Cab at the Door is a classic book on a memoir.

21:08.997 --> 21:14.063
Also, Laurie Lee's Edge of Day and Nabokov, Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine.

21:14.904 --> 21:21.533
Those are probably five or six of the better works in English letters of memoirs.

21:22.154 --> 21:25.117
Now, it's not going to be in the computer.

21:25.999 --> 21:36.692
Now, you can find in the computer Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine, but you need someone to synthesize all of that for you and bring it up and say, look, here's a book that you've overlooked.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.224
Have you read this?

21:38.364 --> 21:39.085
Have you read that?

21:39.565 --> 21:41.447
So that's what you need there at that desk.

21:41.608 --> 21:44.731
You need that specialist librarian with that special collection.

21:45.572 --> 21:53.080
Now, if you put me in a library and put a million books before me, I'm going to be such a generalist.

21:53.761 --> 22:03.591
It's going to be a very roulette lottery that you can find me that will know these special collections in literature.

22:04.280 --> 22:10.347
And you'd like to know who's one of the finer writers and English pros in the last 90 years.

22:10.587 --> 22:13.310
You know, I just have a lot of questions when I go in the library.

22:14.331 --> 22:22.780
Sometimes I'm kind of off-center in reading, and I'd like to have a new writer, someone that would completely change my own eye.

22:23.881 --> 22:33.612
So I left that library that day, and I walked down those long stairs, and I walked immediately across and got access to, I got a permit down at the library.

22:34.233 --> 22:38.159
the desk to a helmet to go in the new library.

22:39.501 --> 22:44.249
I walked in the new library and I was taken by the beauty and the immensity of the building.

22:44.930 --> 22:52.082
But also I was taken back that here in this great rotunda, the beauty was there.

22:52.823 --> 23:00.375
But yet what it did, it took up the same space as the long staircase in the old building, which was the problem with the old building.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.209
It didn't have, what, enough shelf space.

23:04.110 --> 23:09.298
The lineal prodigy of shelving was inadequate.

23:09.318 --> 23:10.720
And so you build a new building.

23:10.760 --> 23:11.641
Now what do you do?

23:11.962 --> 23:16.528
You build a building with extra reserve stacks, don't you?

23:17.449 --> 23:18.070
I hope they do.

23:18.411 --> 23:27.223
If you're out of stack space now and you're pushing books out the corner and discarding them and really having a difficult time,

23:27.372 --> 23:30.377
you be sure that the new building has what?

23:30.797 --> 23:34.243
It should have 40% more stack space.

23:34.263 --> 23:37.508
And a lot of that is reserved stacks.

23:37.528 --> 23:43.538
Now, at the same time we're doing away with the literature and philosophy and religious department, we're creating a what?

23:43.558 --> 23:45.801
A collection on homosexuals.

23:46.102 --> 23:48.365
You know, we're going to have a department of homosexuals.

23:49.107 --> 23:53.093
So I think that reading matter can go in literature, philosophy, and religion

23:53.798 --> 23:59.565
easier than religion, fathers, and living can go into the homosexual department, understand?

24:00.406 --> 24:04.251
I think it's the more important of the two, and it takes overriding precedence.

24:04.812 --> 24:07.676
Although politically, now what they did is remarkable there.

24:08.116 --> 24:17.628
They did the best job, I think, of anyone in the United States of raising public awareness and getting that bond issue through and raising their budget.

24:18.389 --> 24:22.995
I don't think anyone in the United States has done a job equal to what they've done.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.384
you know, in San Francisco.

24:25.425 --> 24:26.165
You just have to.

24:26.185 --> 24:27.607
You've got a lot of private money, too.

24:27.827 --> 24:28.788
Yes, private money.

24:28.828 --> 24:31.071
You just have to stand in awe of what they accomplished.

24:31.992 --> 24:37.859
The friends and the director, and that was an absolutely incredible achievement.

24:39.120 --> 24:45.708
So anyway, as I look at the new building, to me, now there's a book, and I wish I could call it up.

24:45.888 --> 24:51.615
David Belch and I were talking about it, that was put out on the history of American libraries.

24:52.085 --> 24:56.812
And they talked about if you want to destroy a library, hire an architect.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.596
They say that?

25:00.117 --> 25:06.126
Yeah, this is the gist of what they're saying, that architects will do more to destroy a library.

25:06.867 --> 25:08.590
Who are the authors of the book for?

25:08.610 --> 25:10.553
I had to talk to David Belch.

25:11.053 --> 25:17.603
He was talking to me when we were on the last bus tour in San Francisco at the...

25:17.735 --> 25:19.897
The Roxburgh Club.

25:19.917 --> 25:26.844
And I forgot to jot it down, but I remember it vividly because he was talking about the building just like I was.

25:27.545 --> 25:29.327
He and I both had that same impression.

25:29.347 --> 25:30.768
Boy, I'd like to know that book.

25:30.789 --> 25:33.511
Okay, I'll phone David and find out for you.

25:33.531 --> 25:40.579
Because I'll tell you, I've been to the new French library where they hired this young new architect, 36 years old, who'd never done a library in his life.

25:41.420 --> 25:45.784
And they spent close to 2 billion French pounds, not pounds, of francs,

25:46.591 --> 26:02.266
And, you know, have you seen it with these huge towers and glass and the books are upstairs and the reading room is, I mean, it's a statement on French patrimony and all that, but what a half-assed scheme for a library.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.748
My ego gets in my way.

26:04.768 --> 26:05.789
This is only normal.

26:05.829 --> 26:07.090
It's part of the human condition.

26:07.731 --> 26:13.476
The question is trying to control my ego and keep it within balance.

26:14.013 --> 26:16.756
And architects, there's another thing with architecture.

26:17.376 --> 26:23.362
A friend of mine, well, my son is a builder, and he and I talk about this, and his best friend is an architect.

26:24.263 --> 26:39.278
And we've talked with the architect friend of ours, and he said, well, one of the biggest problems is you run up the bill on a public building, you put more expensive doors in, and you just keep adding this, because your percentage then comes out better.

26:39.562 --> 26:48.102
So it's a normal human thing, is the larger the contract, the better the percentage of that the architect makes.

26:48.122 --> 26:51.310
Yeah, but I mean, if you were to have been told that

26:51.762 --> 26:55.648
Here they were going to spend, what is it, $150 million on a new library.

26:55.728 --> 27:04.542
And the day it opens, they don't have enough shelf space just to receive the existing collection.

27:05.043 --> 27:11.232
It's already not sufficient to accommodate the existing collection.

27:11.312 --> 27:12.775
No, this is the tragedy.

27:13.355 --> 27:20.166
Essentially what it was, I think they were so caught up in raising the money, getting the bond issue through,

27:20.568 --> 27:24.432
that they forgot really some of their fundamentals.

27:25.553 --> 27:28.697
For example, they overspent a million dollars.

27:29.518 --> 27:39.409
Well, one fundamental administration is that you have a comptroller, and that comptroller checks me to see that I don't overextend.

27:40.350 --> 27:49.900
And if I put in a requisition for, you know, $100,000 worth of this, new stacks, he puts the requisition back on my desk and says,

27:50.453 --> 27:51.354
Fund's not available.

27:52.015 --> 27:52.415
That's it.

27:53.216 --> 27:58.262
And so these basic principles of administration were basically set aside.

27:59.103 --> 28:02.007
It's like closing the literature department.

28:02.527 --> 28:03.729
These are very basic.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.030
It's like on a football team.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.295
You have that safety in the backfield on defense for what?

28:10.336 --> 28:12.659
He is the one that's the safety.

28:13.200 --> 28:18.486
He's the safety net who makes the tackle that you and I miss.

28:18.702 --> 28:21.385
And it's essential that you have that comptroller.

28:21.565 --> 28:28.292
He's essential to administration as the forecasting and planning is for the director to see in ahead.

28:29.253 --> 28:38.443
And they more or less, I think they were so caught up in the massiveness of the enterprise that some of this went by the side.

28:38.563 --> 28:40.965
And the same thing with the stack space.

28:41.186 --> 28:44.389
I think they were enamored with the building and the architecture

28:44.757 --> 28:49.503
was enamored with it, and they just didn't seem to check lineal footage.

28:49.523 --> 28:52.867
And I wonder if they ever really had librarians in the loop.

28:53.488 --> 28:54.489
That's what I wanted to.

28:54.609 --> 28:55.450
I just don't know.

28:56.211 --> 29:09.528
When I was out there, I talked to the director with Marjorie Stern, and I felt that he was just... You're talking about Dowling now, right?

29:09.688 --> 29:10.269
Yeah, Dowling.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.992
I felt, to me, the handwriting...

29:13.883 --> 29:18.868
outside the building and inside the building, well, administratively, it's time to leave.

29:19.789 --> 29:28.157
You know, and essentially, I went over to the new building, and it was on a neon sign, it's time for me to leave.

29:29.378 --> 29:30.719
You know, there was a difference.

29:30.739 --> 29:33.141
Inside, you could see the old building, you could see the writing.

29:34.082 --> 29:36.464
There was a neon sign on the new building that said to leave.

29:37.045 --> 29:38.366
I don't think Dallin ever got it.

29:39.668 --> 29:41.429
You know, I don't think he got the message.

29:41.469 --> 29:42.270
I don't think he...

29:42.824 --> 29:55.405
He did such an excellent job of getting the issue through and getting the bond issue and getting the budget increased that he was so caught up in that he couldn't see this.

29:56.847 --> 29:58.250
And I think that's normal.

29:58.370 --> 30:04.700
I think as many administrators... I wonder how much background he has in books and libraries, though.

30:04.881 --> 30:07.465
Well, he came from...

30:08.508 --> 30:10.411
It doesn't have to go off the record.

30:10.651 --> 30:11.212
Yeah, that's fine.

30:11.232 --> 30:13.916
And I did an interview with him in his house, by the way.

30:14.516 --> 30:14.617
What?

30:14.957 --> 30:16.800
I did an interview with him in his apartment.

30:17.881 --> 30:18.021
Uh-huh.

30:18.041 --> 30:22.688
And, I mean, this is off the record, but he's got Reader's Digest condensed books there, you know?

30:22.868 --> 30:24.450
Yeah, now this is what I'm saying.

30:25.712 --> 30:30.599
It's just between you and me, but that does give you a sense of what we're talking about here.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.925
Well, see, he had a Topeka, Kansas mind.

30:37.489 --> 30:37.789
You understand?

30:37.972 --> 30:49.365
And this was what I thought anyone that would cut the heart of a metropolitan library with his major department, he's really in Boulder, Colorado, where he came from.

30:49.525 --> 30:51.287
Understand?

30:51.307 --> 30:57.074
He really hasn't, his mind hasn't come up to that metropolitan area.

30:57.595 --> 31:03.201
San Francisco is filled with people with the most wide, interesting, curious interests that you've ever known.

31:04.022 --> 31:06.645
You know, this is not a lazy population out there.

31:07.233 --> 31:13.889
They're very vital and alert and also always challenging and probing into this.

31:13.990 --> 31:19.082
Well, I'll tell you, the outcry that developed

31:19.855 --> 31:23.440
from the people out there, over the library and its holdings.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.763
That was remarkable to see for me.

31:25.783 --> 31:32.411
I mean, these people really fought like crazy to protect the intellectual integrity of the library.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.335
And that's what I think this whole issue is about.

31:35.375 --> 31:40.501
It almost sounded like an anti-intellectual attitude here.

31:41.042 --> 31:41.603
It really was.

31:41.663 --> 31:45.728
I mean, here was a question I asked, and I was never able to get a sufficient answer.

31:46.552 --> 31:52.058
I mean, it is said that nobody knows because nobody kept any records and nobody really wants to know.

31:52.799 --> 31:57.765
But they estimate that perhaps as many as 200,000 books were sent off to the landfill.

31:58.446 --> 31:58.686
Okay.

31:58.706 --> 31:59.727
I wouldn't doubt that at all.

32:00.829 --> 32:01.449
You wouldn't doubt it?

32:01.810 --> 32:02.671
Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.

32:02.691 --> 32:02.791
Okay.

32:02.811 --> 32:08.358
Well, then I said, well, why do we have to estimate?

32:08.458 --> 32:12.222
Didn't anybody keep a record of the books that were deaccessioned?

32:12.775 --> 32:13.576
And they shrugged.

32:13.596 --> 32:14.837
No, I said, you're telling me.

32:14.977 --> 32:22.344
I mean, this to me is, this is really, you know, it's one thing to say we don't want this book anymore.

32:22.864 --> 32:23.645
Let's get rid of it.

32:23.985 --> 32:37.017
It's quite another to say, don't you think it's worth knowing what books you had at a certain point of time in your history, what books were relevant to your readers, say, in the 1930s or the 40s or the 50s, books that were read then that are not read today?

32:37.358 --> 32:42.242
At least a record of the person's, of the book's existence on this earth is not a bad thing.

32:42.222 --> 32:44.546
piece of information to keep, wouldn't you think?

32:44.566 --> 32:48.193
All you had to do is throw one card of the seven cards in a file.

32:48.955 --> 32:50.979
You know, your main entry, and you had it.

32:51.259 --> 32:52.762
In other words, you didn't have to go create it.

32:53.023 --> 32:56.069
But don't you think that's a worthwhile record to keep?

32:56.089 --> 32:57.131
Oh, it is a worthwhile record.

32:57.551 --> 33:02.000
And the main thing is, you're getting back, Nick, to this basics that I'm talking about.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.803
These basic things.

33:03.843 --> 33:05.226
You've got to have a comptroller.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.593
You've got to have your major departments.

33:07.633 --> 33:10.677
You've got to see the library and its literature as a whole.

33:11.017 --> 33:17.225
You've got to have concern for book collections and also the reader that reads other than what you read.

33:18.426 --> 33:23.953
In other words, you may be in a completely field of different interest in reading than what I am.

33:24.593 --> 33:28.318
But your interest in reading is as valid as important as mine.

33:29.559 --> 33:34.605
And I have to understand this and reflect it in a library's collection.

33:34.822 --> 33:41.032
like the New York Public Library, they understand this and know it.

33:41.693 --> 33:49.066
And you have to assume the responsibility if you're going to have a metropolitan library, a metropolitan center, then you need a metropolitan library.

33:49.106 --> 33:50.188
They go hand in hand.

33:50.829 --> 33:55.817
You can't put a little Mickey Mouse library in the center of a metropolitan area and expect it to work.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.737
We're having the same problems in Austin.

33:58.757 --> 34:03.181
All the little French libraries, there's no way you can get a book out of them.

34:03.201 --> 34:09.187
They're just for children's libraries and for a few of the ladies who are reading popular romance and popular literature.

34:09.207 --> 34:17.175
Now, I asked the current librarian, a nice woman, by the way, highly respected, seems like Gina Menoudry, you know who she is?

34:17.235 --> 34:18.757
Uh-huh.

34:18.777 --> 34:22.580
And I said, do you see yourself functioning as a research librarian?

34:22.620 --> 34:23.241
She said, no.

34:24.402 --> 34:24.562
No.

34:24.943 --> 34:25.723
She's from Berkeley.

34:26.104 --> 34:26.344
Yeah.

34:26.392 --> 34:30.638
You know, and see, that's the feeling I'd have in Berkeley, too.

34:31.539 --> 34:33.602
Berkeley and San Francisco are two different cities.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.666
Pete and San Francisco are two different cities.

34:36.687 --> 34:40.652
You know, maybe I'm a little too strong that way.

34:40.672 --> 34:41.734
I could be wrong.

34:41.854 --> 34:42.955
I'm not saying that I'm right.

34:43.336 --> 34:51.287
That's my feeling and my philosophy from knowing the people in San Francisco, their background, their interest, and my own interest as a reader.

34:52.609 --> 34:52.669
Uh,

34:53.543 --> 34:55.466
See, what was I was wanting?

34:55.826 --> 34:57.409
Oh, from the University of Texas.

34:58.110 --> 35:06.762
Odostoyevsky's wife wrote a wonderful book about him, and I wanted to read that book, and my wife wanted to read it.

35:07.203 --> 35:08.745
Now, this is an esoteric book.

35:10.988 --> 35:11.930
I just came across it.

35:12.030 --> 35:14.353
Oh, I came across it from reading B.S.

35:14.373 --> 35:14.694
Pritchett.

35:15.335 --> 35:17.678
You know, he has a marvelous collection of essays.

35:18.265 --> 35:20.249
I think I have it here someplace.

35:20.529 --> 35:22.553
You read his essay on Mark Twain?

35:22.673 --> 35:24.016
I mean, Todd is rich.

35:24.637 --> 35:27.041
It's the best essay on Mark Twain.

35:27.061 --> 35:27.622
Okay, good.

35:27.642 --> 35:29.806
I've got his essays and his short stories here, too.

35:30.207 --> 35:38.923
And you read that on Mark Twain and how he dissipated his life, this great talent, and his only great work came out of there, you know, was Huckleberry Finn.

35:39.308 --> 35:44.154
And the rest of his life he just prostituted because he was so hungry for money.

35:45.555 --> 35:50.421
But anyway, in Pritchett's, he was talking about Dostoevsky and he was talking about this book.

35:50.441 --> 35:52.583
So I got on the Internet and tried to pick it up.

35:52.944 --> 35:56.428
I got access to the UT catalog, and they didn't have it.

35:57.249 --> 36:02.034
And I phoned Harold Billings up, the director, and I said, Come on, Harold, what's wrong with you guys down there?

36:02.835 --> 36:04.317
I want to get the copy of this book.

36:04.357 --> 36:06.379
He said, Well, Bill, we'll search it out and get it.

36:06.899 --> 36:11.027
And they searched it out, and I think it's now in, and it's going through catalog.

36:11.708 --> 36:16.558
But here's a reader who comes across this book, and I'd like to read.

36:17.059 --> 36:23.050
He married this young girl, lady, and she turned out to be an inspiration to him.

36:23.792 --> 36:28.080
And she took notes and took a Kepa diary of his life.

36:28.432 --> 36:30.214
And then she wrote this marvelous book.

36:30.374 --> 36:31.035
No kidding.

36:31.175 --> 36:36.640
Pritchett said about his life and his way of writing and his way of meeting people.

36:36.801 --> 36:38.422
Sounds fascinating.

36:38.642 --> 36:39.884
It sounds fascinating.

36:39.904 --> 36:40.805
I haven't read the book yet.

36:41.245 --> 36:42.667
But to me, I want to read the book.

36:43.287 --> 36:47.752
And I don't see any reason why a large metropolitan library shouldn't have that book for me.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.936
I like to go back and explore all these other writers.

36:52.537 --> 36:54.358
Even if I've read them, I like to read them again.

36:54.418 --> 36:57.041
It's like Ternia's love story.

36:57.061 --> 36:57.882
He wrote one of the great

36:58.199 --> 37:01.242
romance novel, love stories of all time.

37:02.523 --> 37:09.610
But anyway, maybe I'm more university mind-oriented.

37:10.050 --> 37:11.552
I could easily be wrong.

37:12.072 --> 37:13.353
I think you have to have both.

37:13.393 --> 37:22.862
You meet the public's demand for the popular, but you have in reserve in this central core library this reference type of collection.

37:23.222 --> 37:24.744
And they've always had it in San Francisco.

37:24.764 --> 37:25.945
There's nothing new.

37:26.397 --> 37:35.250
You know, what they did wrong there, they would lose so many books through theft, they wouldn't replace them, and they didn't know what they had on their shelves.

37:36.292 --> 37:43.663
But in terms of a collection, they had some remarkable books in that library, you know, before I got there.

37:44.203 --> 37:47.448
You know, it wasn't a dead collection by any means.

37:47.468 --> 37:49.992
The tragedy, what they did...

37:50.495 --> 37:51.997
They had this policy.

37:52.538 --> 37:58.126
They let the bookbinder come in and select off the shelf the books to be bound, and so he destroyed a lot of books.

37:59.708 --> 38:03.194
You know, he put Buckram binding over a... When was this?

38:03.254 --> 38:07.580
Oh, this was in the... I'd say in the 40s, 50s.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.481
Oh, a long time ago.

38:08.722 --> 38:11.506
Yeah, 40s and 50s, and before I got there.

38:11.906 --> 38:17.194
And then what I did, I... I...

38:17.427 --> 38:26.819
I drafted new specifications for binding, and it was awarded to another binder outside the city.

38:26.839 --> 38:36.492
And then Futernik owned the bindery, and he came down to, he said on the phone, he said, well, I'm going to come down and show you how we operate in San Francisco.

38:37.653 --> 38:46.084
So he came down before the board, and the front page article came out the next day where he admitted that he had overcharged

38:46.418 --> 38:55.870
overbilled the library, and also he didn't use the binding boards that were specified in the specifications and all the other things he didn't do.

38:55.890 --> 38:58.554
So I didn't hear from him anymore.

38:58.614 --> 39:00.296
I heard from his lawyer he was going to sue me.

39:01.498 --> 39:05.843
I had a tape of the meeting, and I never heard about the suit.

39:06.825 --> 39:12.612
But anyway, it was that type of thing that they would, well, for example, magazines.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.525
You'd send Futernik, they'd send Futernik the magazines to be bound.

39:17.447 --> 39:23.756
And so they'd come back XXX and they'd be $75, $150 a copy device.

39:24.837 --> 39:25.879
And I said, well, why is this?

39:25.899 --> 39:28.543
He said, well, there were terrible conditions and this and that.

39:29.204 --> 39:34.612
So then I had my administrative assistant go down and set up 12 volumes and collate every page.

39:35.693 --> 39:36.995
And we sent them into the bindery.

39:37.816 --> 39:39.679
And they came back with the same charges.

39:40.688 --> 39:49.519
And at the end of the year, that same 12, the budget came back to the exact penny as to what the total budget was for binding.

39:51.322 --> 39:52.283
That's amazing.

39:52.743 --> 39:54.065
And that type of thing began.

39:54.786 --> 39:59.852
You know, it was really a payoff to Futernik that he contributed to the local policy.

39:59.872 --> 40:05.259
So why don't we go, can you just tell me briefly how you decided to go into being a librarian?

40:06.341 --> 40:07.422
Oh, I think one thing.

40:10.372 --> 40:22.369
I think you can't separate a person's... I think when I had experienced an institutional life, I left that.

40:22.429 --> 40:27.116
Now, my wife says that, you know, I could go to hell in five days to find good weather.

40:29.119 --> 40:32.864
But out of that institutional life, it marked me, too.

40:33.766 --> 40:37.611
I had periods of loneliness, and I often turned to reading.

40:38.198 --> 41:03.919
And then when I was in Trumride, Oklahoma, Katie Shikram, who was a next-door neighbor of mine, a Jewish lady, who was a teacher, and she taught, took me in hand, took me to the library, got my library card, and I read out of her library, and later she was a substitute English teacher in high school, and she led me through so much literature.

41:04.203 --> 41:08.067
And she inspired me with this idea that books are just vitally important.

41:08.087 --> 41:15.195
They're not something that you just read, you know, for relaxation or for escape.

41:15.856 --> 41:26.388
That they were vital for your future and to enlarge your own vision of life that later on it will become so much, they're such friends that later they become so important to you.

41:27.369 --> 41:30.733
And she put that, then when I went to

41:31.102 --> 41:40.952
OU, I had this course in bibliography under Mary Hayes Marable, who was voted one of the outstanding teachers in Oklahoma.

41:41.092 --> 41:44.695
She was one of the women of the year in Oklahoma.

41:45.216 --> 41:48.159
And she's the one that said, well, Bill, you shouldn't go in law.

41:49.160 --> 41:55.286
And all of us lawyers were taking this pre-course in bibliography, you know, in libraries.

41:55.826 --> 41:58.729
And she was the head of the library science department there.

41:58.979 --> 42:05.789
And she's the one that said, well, Bill, you should go to Illinois and get your master's and go into library administration.

42:05.809 --> 42:07.472
She said, that's just a wide open field.

42:07.512 --> 42:12.059
It's just a field that you would enjoy and you'd be very good at.

42:12.099 --> 42:14.322
So I took her advance.

42:14.342 --> 42:15.704
So I had a wife and two children.

42:15.805 --> 42:21.633
I graduated from OU, left there, arrived at Champaign-Urbana with $17 in her pocket.

42:21.694 --> 42:25.279
And I had a fellowship there in the reference department.

42:25.579 --> 42:27.282
My wife went to work waiting tables.

42:27.717 --> 42:42.552
And we went through, you know, but I think, you know, this one quotation that's on page 172, 173 of the history of San Francisco Library is one that I had Herman Thoth do a calligraphy for the library.

42:43.172 --> 42:46.515
It's Theo Varley, and I've never found now where I found this quotation.

42:47.316 --> 42:53.202
It says, an education through books is a companion which no misforced can depress.

42:54.042 --> 43:19.470
And I think that's a very, very cogent and with great clarity of what I feel about books.

43:20.211 --> 43:21.552
And I still feel that way.

43:23.506 --> 43:26.831
I haven't changed my feeling there.

43:26.851 --> 43:37.789
And Herman Zoff, the great calligrapher, who will one day go down in the history, much larger than Baskerville or Caslon, did that in 1966.

43:37.929 --> 43:44.400
I had him do a commission for the San Francisco Public Library, that quotation.

43:45.359 --> 43:45.920
That's great.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.143
And that's illustrated on those pages.

43:49.025 --> 43:51.188
Did you know Tilly Olson when you were out there?

43:51.489 --> 43:52.931
Yes, uh-huh.

43:52.951 --> 43:54.554
I interviewed Tilly for this book.

43:54.654 --> 43:56.517
She's a very interesting woman.

43:56.697 --> 43:58.680
She's a very interesting writer, very good.

43:58.701 --> 44:00.283
Yeah, and she's fascinating.

44:00.303 --> 44:04.670
Of course, she is a reader and totally self-educated by her own reading.

44:04.991 --> 44:05.832
Yeah.

44:06.571 --> 44:09.975
are very interested in people who are shaped by their reading.

44:10.275 --> 44:13.519
Well, like Pritchett, he learned how to write through reading.

44:13.919 --> 44:14.380
Who is this?

44:14.981 --> 44:15.261
V.S.

44:15.281 --> 44:15.882
Pritchett.

44:15.902 --> 44:16.362
Is that right?

44:16.562 --> 44:16.963
The English.

44:17.043 --> 44:17.804
Oh, yeah.

44:17.964 --> 44:22.870
That's how he went back and studied particularly all the Russian writers.

44:23.651 --> 44:27.175
And the English novelist, he was... He says that?

44:27.455 --> 44:27.835
Oh, yes.

44:28.476 --> 44:29.137
In his essays?

44:30.018 --> 44:30.639
Let's see.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.781
How did I come back to that?

44:33.571 --> 44:45.527
I think somewhere in one of his introductions he talks about this, and I don't know which one, but I came away with that very strong impression, you know, that here's a writer who went back.

44:45.567 --> 44:48.131
He didn't go to college, you know.

44:48.391 --> 44:49.533
That's one I have to have then.

44:50.074 --> 44:51.395
He was self-educated, you know.

44:51.956 --> 44:55.761
So to speak, he went to, you know, what we'd call high school.

44:55.821 --> 44:57.163
Right.

44:57.764 --> 45:02.110
But he went on and essentially...

45:02.647 --> 45:04.689
That was the limit of his education.

45:05.070 --> 45:05.570
That's great.

45:05.650 --> 45:06.411
I'm going to check it out.

45:06.731 --> 45:14.900
Well, you go back and read his essays, and his essays now give an analysis of the writing of, oh, how do you pronounce the Russian writer?

45:14.921 --> 45:15.501
Turgenev?

45:15.561 --> 45:16.142
Turgenev.

45:16.342 --> 45:17.103
Turgenev.

45:17.563 --> 45:17.744
Turgenev.

45:17.764 --> 45:19.205
So it looks like Turgenev.

45:19.225 --> 45:20.106
Yeah, Turgenev.

45:20.126 --> 45:24.691
Just like T-U-R, then G-A-I-N, and then Y-E-F-F, Turgenev.

45:25.532 --> 45:25.833
Turgenev.

45:25.853 --> 45:26.513
Turgenev.

45:26.734 --> 45:29.416
I have a problem with pronunciation.

45:29.457 --> 45:32.620
I have kind of a little stutter for my...

45:32.600 --> 45:34.563
I used to stutter when I was in those homes.

45:34.583 --> 45:35.364
Boy, I wouldn't know it.

45:35.965 --> 45:37.947
And so I still have that.

45:38.628 --> 45:41.372
Well, it sounds to me like you've pretty well controlled it, really.

45:41.412 --> 45:43.876
Well, I've controlled it fairly well, you know, fairly well.

45:44.536 --> 45:52.748
But you read his essay on Germany, now you understand where he's coming from, where his mentor is.

45:53.208 --> 45:53.849
And there it is.

45:54.490 --> 45:57.274
You know, that was one of his, probably his strongest mentor.

45:57.760 --> 46:02.792
and Tolstoy probably to some degree, but I don't think as strong as

46:03.008 --> 46:12.464
I can't tell you how this information is just as interesting, if not even more interesting to me, than the San Francisco Public Library story.

46:12.925 --> 46:13.245
Oh, it is.

46:13.505 --> 46:19.896
I've got to tell you, because that story, after I've been into it too much, I think I've got to say that people have to settle down a little bit out there.

46:20.617 --> 46:21.659
They've got to relax.

46:22.000 --> 46:22.801
Well, I think they will.

46:23.182 --> 46:28.010
You know, I mean, you have to just kind of sit back and say, look, we've got this building.

46:28.170 --> 46:29.252
We're not going to tear it down.

46:29.312 --> 46:29.472
No.

46:29.452 --> 46:32.194
No, what you do is go in there and improvise.

46:32.215 --> 46:33.035
That's right, yeah.

46:33.095 --> 46:35.698
And you take certain departments and consolidate.

46:35.738 --> 46:36.198
That's right.

46:36.578 --> 46:39.041
And it's like in the old building, see.

46:39.441 --> 46:41.943
The old building, when I went there, didn't have a subject department.

46:42.544 --> 46:44.526
It just had one reference department.

46:44.546 --> 46:50.892
Well, I went in there and we created a subject department library in there with hardly any increase in budget.

46:51.632 --> 46:58.058
I brought in one fine staff member for one department, took another staff member and put her in charge of another.

46:58.038 --> 47:05.376
And we created a metropolitan reference library there within a matter of six months, you know.

47:05.857 --> 47:12.233
And the same way at that building that they have now, you have to go in there and improvise and...
