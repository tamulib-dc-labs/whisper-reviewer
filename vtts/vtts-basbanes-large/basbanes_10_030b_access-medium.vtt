WEBVTT

00:05.330 --> 00:14.722
The ones that are in the Institute know about it because the people teaching them tell them that it's there.

00:16.565 --> 00:32.265
Now, these are collections that aren't only used by them because scholarly research has become much more interdisciplinary in the last 10 or 15 years.

00:33.713 --> 00:40.863
Lots of people probably doing literary criticism that are using the history science collections.

00:40.923 --> 00:56.023
But Toronto does have one of the great history science collections in North America.

00:56.043 --> 01:02.472
You know, the other thing we did was in 1968,

01:02.570 --> 01:06.075
We bought from Richard Freeman his Darwin collection.

01:06.676 --> 01:13.406
He did the bibliographical hand list of Darwin and used that as a basis to build on.

01:13.486 --> 01:16.250
And we have the best Darwin collection in the world.

01:17.051 --> 01:18.153
In the world.

01:18.173 --> 01:18.533
Yeah.

01:18.553 --> 01:20.396
We don't have the manuscripts.

01:20.416 --> 01:23.220
But a printed edition is apparently.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.143
They're mainly at Cambridge.

01:25.163 --> 01:29.269
But if you want to do textual work with the printed

01:29.806 --> 01:33.331
sources and bibliographical work with Darwin.

01:33.432 --> 01:36.316
Do you have the best collections anyway?

01:37.758 --> 01:38.379
Bill Bilda.

01:38.479 --> 01:58.210
In San Francisco, in fact, I bought for the University, Alfred Russel Wallace's first scientific appearance in print, which is in a Welsh journal.

01:58.561 --> 02:00.484
which I know we don't have.

02:00.504 --> 02:04.350
I was just about to say, how did you know this?

02:04.370 --> 02:08.897
Did you travel with a warrantless?

02:09.077 --> 02:10.339
It's what's in my head.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.325
How large is the collection that you have as supervision?

02:15.046 --> 02:19.292
Oh, about 500,000 volumes, plus the manuscript.

02:19.453 --> 02:22.137
Right, so you certainly don't know everything that's in there.

02:22.237 --> 02:23.639
Oh, heavens no, no, no, no.

02:23.659 --> 02:25.682
But now you must have areas that you're

02:27.653 --> 02:31.617
actively trying to strengthen, what would they be?

02:34.580 --> 02:37.222
All of them.

02:37.282 --> 02:42.207
The only question that... Perhaps.

02:42.608 --> 02:51.416
Do you honestly have that kind of a mandate from the university that will allow you, that will encourage you to strengthen every collection that you have?

02:51.616 --> 02:52.157
Absolutely.

02:52.597 --> 02:54.699
If I can find the money, I can do it on my own.

02:54.719 --> 02:55.500
Oh, that's the key.

02:56.324 --> 02:59.067
No, they'll provide some too.

02:59.107 --> 02:59.628
They care.

02:59.668 --> 03:13.944
The president of the University of Toronto does come, gets all excited about medieval Hebrew manuscripts, although he wouldn't actually recognize one if it fell on his head.

03:15.286 --> 03:17.007
But he makes all the right noises.

03:18.289 --> 03:21.653
You know, we have real support all the way down the line.

03:21.673 --> 03:25.437
But, you know, that's now almost 30 years.

03:25.788 --> 03:31.128
you know, it isn't just automatically there.

03:31.148 --> 03:35.865
You have to pay attention to, you know, all your communities,

03:36.132 --> 03:41.579
Well, do they give you money, or are you largely, are you also a fundraiser?

03:41.639 --> 03:46.085
If it's something you want, fine, you can have it, but you have to do it.

03:46.766 --> 03:48.488
Is that right?

03:48.989 --> 03:49.570
Mm-hmm.

03:49.590 --> 03:50.311
Last June.

03:50.771 --> 03:52.053
It's a combination of bucks.

03:52.073 --> 03:58.161
No, I mean, do you have, you know, the LCA equivalent of a Madison Council and a, you know, I mean, he'll give you a million bucks a year.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.903
Oh, sorry.

03:59.923 --> 04:01.806
No, no, sadly, no.

04:03.108 --> 04:04.890
Um...

04:04.870 --> 04:17.385
Last June, I was phoned by a dealer in Montreal who had acquired some 18th century English literature, and Moylam was a nonce volume.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.689
A what volume?

04:20.709 --> 04:21.770
A nonce volume.

04:22.831 --> 04:28.498
It was 40 folio poems, all bound together in contemporary caps.

04:29.457 --> 04:50.993
and it had a bit of swift and pope but this is mainly 1732 to 35 and but it had stephen duck in it it had all these anonymous things wonderful stuff lots of we had some of it but not most of it we didn't have and

04:52.492 --> 04:57.819
I haven't seen one of those things, a folio one, for 25 years.

04:57.859 --> 04:59.421
They usually get broken up.

04:59.441 --> 05:00.602
They're always broken up.

05:00.682 --> 05:08.432
You see the individual cones disbound, is what you see, because they get broken up.

05:09.593 --> 05:14.099
So she said, was I interested?

05:14.119 --> 05:15.120
And I said, yes.

05:15.301 --> 05:18.645
And in the description, she did.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.507
We did some checking.

05:20.977 --> 05:29.447
And she said, well, I'm taking this to London next week for the book fair, unless you buy it.

05:30.749 --> 05:33.692
And I said, fine, how much is this?

05:33.712 --> 05:41.622
$12,000, which is really cheap.

05:41.642 --> 05:45.226
So I said, I'll take it.

05:46.668 --> 05:48.570
Send me two invoices, one

05:48.837 --> 05:51.260
$6,000 and another $6,000.

05:51.280 --> 05:59.152
And, you know, you may have to wait a little longer than 30 days.

06:00.273 --> 06:02.376
But a good bookstore would be willing to do that.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.758
Sure.

06:04.159 --> 06:07.183
But I didn't actually have $12,000.

06:07.585 --> 06:12.934
for that kind of material.

06:15.979 --> 06:31.163
So Marie and I had lunch with a guy who's been one of our donors, and so we asked George for lunch, and he came, and we both had a little agenda for him.

06:31.750 --> 06:38.338
because he provided some support for a printing assistant for the college for Massey.

06:38.419 --> 06:43.886
I'm, incidentally, also a fellow at Massey College, so we're even more anxious.

06:44.206 --> 06:50.254
And so I told him, I know this guy likes poetry.

06:52.256 --> 06:53.178
He reads poetry.

06:53.418 --> 06:59.766
He runs a huge investment council firm around

07:00.083 --> 07:02.245
And I said, OK, George, this is for you.

07:03.206 --> 07:10.573
This stuff, scams, rhymes, as in couplets, this is classic, Augustine age poetry.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.515
You'd like to read?

07:13.796 --> 07:15.157
It's only 12,000 bucks.

07:15.177 --> 07:16.178
He wrote me a check.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.460
That's great.

07:17.480 --> 07:22.645
$12,000 American dollars.

07:23.005 --> 07:23.305
No.

07:24.907 --> 07:28.350
Fortunately, I was a dealer from Montreal.

07:28.370 --> 07:29.331
Oh, great.

07:29.497 --> 07:37.950
You just don't see this, though.

07:38.672 --> 07:42.317
You don't see an institutional collector.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.763
Well, who can tell you, the last time... Collecting this aggressively.

07:45.783 --> 07:48.948
I was in... Maybe I haven't traveled.

07:49.188 --> 07:51.071
Steve Weissman, who I'm sure you've met.

07:51.091 --> 07:51.933
I know, Steve.

07:51.973 --> 07:55.318
I'm hoping he's going to be in London around there, too, but we'll see.

07:55.568 --> 07:57.910
He's probably still there.

07:57.990 --> 08:04.677
They bought a house in the cost of 100 yards of the canvas at the bottom of the garden.

08:05.858 --> 08:23.955
When Steve was in New York, and we went to see him every time we went to New York, both for the institution and ourselves, he claimed that there were only five librarians left who came to see him.

08:24.408 --> 08:32.558
I mean, lots of people bought from his list, from his catalogs, but actually came and looked at the stuff, picked stuff off the shelves, had it quoted.

08:32.918 --> 08:35.301
So you're one, Roger Stoddard has to be another.

08:35.962 --> 08:38.905
Mark McCorrison certainly has to be a third.

08:39.106 --> 08:42.270
There's two of us, so that's four.

08:42.430 --> 08:43.171
Don Eddy.

08:43.331 --> 08:44.532
Don Eddy was the fifth.

08:45.093 --> 08:46.635
Don Eddy being where?

08:47.075 --> 08:47.636
Cornell.

08:47.656 --> 08:50.019
The Cornell person.

08:50.079 --> 08:50.179
Okay.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.666
I'm going to talk to Don Eddy.

08:52.686 --> 08:56.803
Now, Steve, now it's down.

08:56.863 --> 08:58.931
I saw him in Manhattan in October.

08:58.951 --> 09:01.300
Had lunch with him on King Henry's road.

09:01.668 --> 09:04.651
Well, we're down to three now.

09:07.455 --> 09:10.098
Marie and Maeve and Roger, I think.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.261
What's the significance of this?

09:13.301 --> 09:14.643
This is pretty interesting, isn't it?

09:14.983 --> 09:19.248
Well, the significance is... I mean, everybody believes you have to have all the goods.

09:19.288 --> 09:22.592
You have to go out and see the stuff, feel the stuff, smell the stuff.

09:22.612 --> 09:24.975
You have to try and experience it.

09:25.310 --> 09:34.955
I wonder if I see this in the larger context of, you know, the book is really... I mean, we have libraries that are no longer libraries anymore.

09:35.516 --> 09:38.464
Michigan just built a place that's not called the library.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.770
It's a learning center or something, yeah.

09:40.919 --> 09:42.341
You know, the Ford Ord thing.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.303
That's a big deal, as far as I'm concerned.

09:44.323 --> 09:46.185
There was not a library in the plans.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.730
I mean, when they opened this new college, there was not a library there.

09:50.150 --> 09:52.834
And then they responded to public criticism, and they put one in.

09:53.154 --> 09:55.437
But there's no books there, from what I understand.

09:55.457 --> 10:02.766
I think... I'm, you know, documenting all this stuff.

10:02.846 --> 10:08.833
What it means is that institutions...

10:10.096 --> 10:16.124
have shifted.

10:16.364 --> 10:20.430
The old ones that have great staff had lots of it.

10:21.391 --> 10:23.774
Now hire or try and hire managers.

10:25.617 --> 10:29.202
You see, Roger will never be the head of Houghton.

10:29.222 --> 10:29.522
Never.

10:32.523 --> 10:35.414
No, no, that isn't the reason.

10:35.434 --> 10:36.999
I mean, he's too good a book man.

10:37.060 --> 10:40.452
That may be true, but that's not the reason he won't be out of hope.

10:42.219 --> 10:42.921
What's the reason?

10:43.373 --> 10:45.216
You've got to fight with the English Department.

10:45.536 --> 10:48.621
Well, so Roger actually is not a very good administrator.

10:48.641 --> 11:00.558
And the sad thing is that you have to be able to delegate and to organize things in such a way that a department runs smoothly, especially one of the size of the hotel.

11:00.578 --> 11:10.393
You can't run a place that's got 30 to 40 people in it by doing everything yourself.

11:10.762 --> 11:13.405
I mean, my place runs fine when I'm not there.

11:13.425 --> 11:17.930
In fact, they claim that I'm better.

11:18.090 --> 11:19.332
I cause crises.

11:20.133 --> 11:20.793
Crises are good.

11:20.854 --> 11:21.654
When I'm there.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.579
Well, Wendorf is out at Harvard.

11:25.599 --> 11:26.100
Yeah.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.842
Have they replaced him yet?

11:27.902 --> 11:28.282
Not yet.

11:28.302 --> 11:29.483
No, no, they're riding around.

11:29.884 --> 11:32.146
I told you they wrote both of us a letter.

11:33.428 --> 11:36.111
I didn't realize it was for that position when you mentioned that.

11:38.521 --> 11:47.410
Neither of us are going to go there, but... Unless they want to offer it to both of you, that would be interesting.

11:47.430 --> 11:48.130
We have a team, a team appointment.

11:48.150 --> 11:49.912
Is Leslie still with that?

11:49.932 --> 11:51.113
Yes, she is.

11:51.153 --> 11:52.314
Did you work with her at all?

11:52.454 --> 12:05.507
I worked with her, well, we were in different institutions, but I worked with her in the context of this consortium that we established.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.583
And I admire her work greatly.

12:08.623 --> 12:11.067
She's really top-notch.

12:11.107 --> 12:12.329
She was so helpful to me.

12:12.870 --> 12:14.192
She's good.

12:14.292 --> 12:29.554
I mean, she would say to me, I have done extraordinary things without having had to raise all that much money.

12:30.361 --> 12:36.974
Because, I mean, the ultimate solution to, I mean, everybody realizes you can't have everything.

12:36.994 --> 12:43.106
So, what you hope is that some other place has what you don't have.

12:45.230 --> 12:52.825
So, now, if you're in a major institution, I mean, I used to have this argument with Bob Rosenthal all the time.

12:53.210 --> 12:59.255
who didn't believe in class, he didn't give a shit about whether Chicago had a first edition of Paradise Lab.

13:00.216 --> 13:01.678
You can see that anywhere.

13:02.618 --> 13:08.744
But where are you going to find, you know, Reggie Turner's fiction?

13:10.426 --> 13:12.147
Well, not very many places.

13:12.287 --> 13:21.455
So what you should do, and Bob did this in Chicago, is collect the stuff that nobody else has.

13:21.536 --> 13:23.217
Now, this is a really good principle

13:24.209 --> 13:33.918
As an institution, the books I want most are ones no one else has, because then they've got to come to Toronto to use them.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.281
Is that always in the back of your mind, they've got to come here?

13:36.941 --> 13:39.884
Or is there a collecting impulse?

13:39.944 --> 13:42.567
No, the collecting impulse is there, too.

13:43.188 --> 13:53.878
But it is also true that your reputation, to some extent, is based on what you have that

13:54.719 --> 13:57.282
people can't see anywhere else.

13:57.763 --> 13:58.464
Yep, thanks.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.575
That's a Greek response to the calamari, too.

14:07.595 --> 14:08.897
The what?

14:08.937 --> 14:11.039
I'm a... Oh, excuse me.

14:11.099 --> 14:12.441
I didn't say what you meant.

14:12.461 --> 14:18.128
I'm Greek for persuasion.

14:19.762 --> 14:23.487
Anything else or is that everything else?

14:23.687 --> 14:25.609
That's fine, just the bill, Kathy.

14:25.629 --> 14:27.171
Okay.

14:27.191 --> 14:47.676
But they, you know, the notion that you can specialize and build things and build on strength without necessarily having to have

14:48.297 --> 14:51.502
I mean, the great example for Toronto is American literature.

14:52.703 --> 14:59.693
We do not collect in a serious way American literature for a couple of reasons.

15:00.374 --> 15:04.240
One is that, I mean, there's lots in the stacks that people want to read.

15:04.260 --> 15:08.586
I mean, the printed division, they're in the stacks.

15:09.548 --> 15:18.220
The reason is that nobody started early enough, and by the time I arrived, it was really

15:18.790 --> 15:21.494
too late without an enormous expenditure.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.959
What are you going to be able to do that Lilly hasn't done?

15:26.001 --> 15:30.407
Well, sure, even more significant.

15:30.548 --> 15:31.990
Buffalo's not very far.

15:32.050 --> 15:34.533
New York's not very far.

15:34.694 --> 15:36.076
Boston's not very far.

15:36.877 --> 15:41.203
So these incredible resources are within an hour of Toronto.

15:42.085 --> 15:44.308
So you have to think of a Canadian scholar.

15:44.508 --> 15:51.978
But if somebody wants to give us a great collection, or fund a great collection, then fine.

15:52.238 --> 15:53.580
I'm all for it.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.040
Sure.

15:54.361 --> 15:56.584
I'll start collecting American literature tomorrow.

15:57.865 --> 16:01.450
And the American... It's kind of Britain's widow and find out what she's going to do with the other book.

16:01.810 --> 16:04.794
Well, Selma, I suspect.

16:05.155 --> 16:09.580
No, I think Paul should be going to end up there.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.324
I think the core collection will go to the rest of it.

16:12.344 --> 16:13.045
Will it?

16:13.065 --> 16:13.165
Yeah.

16:13.769 --> 16:18.795
But he was, Carter Bruden was already starting to sell stuff.

16:18.815 --> 16:26.203
He was, but the core collection, which is really wonderful, you know, he had 70,000 books, but really maybe 20,000, they're really wonderful.

16:26.943 --> 16:27.044
Yeah.

16:27.064 --> 16:30.628
Which you, you know, somebody like yourself would love to have.

16:30.648 --> 16:30.888
Sure.

16:31.529 --> 16:34.792
Who would really want all 70,000 of those things, you know?

16:36.274 --> 16:38.176
Well, that's a whole other story.

16:38.236 --> 16:40.198
Another thing, where are you going to put them?

16:40.550 --> 16:50.967
And you do get into, with collections like that, if, you know, I do... These are rarities, but what is the scholarly value to them, is what I'd like to know.

16:52.650 --> 17:02.727
Well, what would the scholarly value be to an inscribed Salinger, you know, book of stories?

17:02.787 --> 17:05.612
Rare as it undoubtedly is, but...

17:06.841 --> 17:09.164
Why would you pay $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 for that?

17:10.205 --> 17:13.910
Well, those are two different questions.

17:14.190 --> 17:19.938
The reason you would pay that much is that the modern first market is a different thing.

17:20.178 --> 17:22.922
Yeah, but does that impact on you, actually?

17:24.403 --> 17:31.853
It does to the extent that certain things we do want are

17:32.187 --> 17:43.057
more pricier because of that market, so that, for instance, Malcolm Lowry's first book, Ultramarine, is a very expensive book.

17:43.137 --> 17:51.445
Now, fortunately, I found one at a Russell Hotel fair in London for 400 pounds.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.248
So we have it.

17:54.788 --> 17:56.089
It took me 20 years, though.

17:57.351 --> 17:58.652
It took me 25 years.

17:58.732 --> 18:01.975
I became the first American on that, which doesn't count, of course.

18:02.697 --> 18:05.742
It took me 25 years to find Anna Green Gables.

18:07.566 --> 18:12.033
That, of course, has great Canadian significance.

18:12.073 --> 18:15.099
So, you know, I had to pay $5,000 for it.

18:16.641 --> 18:19.346
What do you get for $5,000 when you buy a book like that?

18:21.831 --> 18:27.220
If you're going to have what you think is the greatest collection of Canadian literature in the country,

18:27.757 --> 18:29.499
you've got to have Anne of Queen Gables.

18:29.579 --> 18:42.090
I mean, this is the problem with Rosenthal's theory, that if you're part, if you're the University of Toronto, you've got to have a first edition of Paradise Lost.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.172
I mean, you've got to have all this other stuff as well.

18:44.192 --> 18:45.514
Well, why do you have to Paradise Lost?

18:45.694 --> 18:51.579
Well, just because it's, this is the canon.

18:52.140 --> 18:52.760
Okay.

18:53.361 --> 18:55.603
I'm just asking.

18:56.377 --> 18:58.901
Just to be respectable.

18:59.822 --> 19:04.329
I mean, Toronto has the only set of four folios in Canada.

19:04.730 --> 19:06.653
We have the only first folio in Canada.

19:07.034 --> 19:07.655
How do you know that?

19:09.578 --> 19:10.259
There's only one?

19:11.821 --> 19:18.832
UBC had a set for a while, but they were on loan from the Folger, and as I understand it, the Folger took them back.

19:19.453 --> 19:20.595
You mean they couldn't spare one?

19:21.048 --> 19:24.433
I think they did this.

19:24.533 --> 19:27.076
It was a very odd thing, and it was years and years ago.

19:27.316 --> 19:28.578
That's a problem with Folger.

19:28.598 --> 19:29.539
Why couldn't they give one?

19:30.180 --> 19:32.343
They decided that... Or sell one to you.

19:32.443 --> 19:35.548
Well, I think they saw the Slippery Slope.

19:36.168 --> 19:40.394
They decided that they would land out two sets.

19:40.414 --> 19:42.497
One went to UBC, and one went to St.

19:42.637 --> 19:42.998
Andrews.

19:44.199 --> 19:50.768
And then I guess there was some pressure for another one, and they said, hang on, why is it...

19:50.883 --> 19:57.432
that we have 79 first folios or 81, depending on how you count the fragments.

19:57.792 --> 20:01.617
Well, did they come up with a satisfactory answer to that?

20:01.637 --> 20:02.959
Why do they have that many?

20:02.979 --> 20:08.967
Well, the answer was that... It could just be the Hinman... So Hinman could look at them.

20:09.267 --> 20:12.932
It's a pretty weak... No, no, but it's not too far off.

20:13.513 --> 20:19.641
The Boston Athenaeum telling you why they bought that...

20:19.942 --> 20:22.024
set of whatever it was.

20:22.285 --> 20:22.545
That's right.

20:22.565 --> 20:45.190
Well, I mean, the Boston Public Library and its two Baysom books, you know, and I, every time I see Bill Scheide, he says to me, the definition of duplitude is that at least before 1830, and in many cases after, there is no such thing as a duplitude in the absolute literal sense.

20:45.250 --> 20:49.695
There are no two copies of printed book exactly the same.

20:50.401 --> 20:52.983
Except maybe by coincidence.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.926
Well, see, I've interviewed Owen Gingrich for my new book.

20:55.946 --> 20:57.768
I love what he's done with Copernicus.

20:57.948 --> 20:58.929
That's fascinating.

20:58.949 --> 21:01.471
Well, I'll show you a great Copernicus if you want.

21:01.531 --> 21:02.392
Okay, sure.

21:02.412 --> 21:04.194
I'm sure that Owen's handled it already.

21:04.254 --> 21:05.475
Oh, yes, oh, yeah.

21:06.055 --> 21:17.826
Well, he kind of, we believe that it belonged to the first guy to teach Copernican theory in Germany.

21:17.992 --> 21:27.026
Well, that would give it four or five stars in his, because what he's trying to do is determine the influence, the impact that each of these paintings have.

21:27.827 --> 21:33.055
And, of course, everyone was bound by the individual owner, so that's an interesting bibliographical element to it.

21:33.596 --> 21:36.461
But he's looking for the annotations and the marginality of it.

21:36.781 --> 21:39.886
This one, this is Philip Landsberg's copy.

21:41.548 --> 21:45.855
He may even have handled more First Copernicus

21:46.274 --> 21:50.539
than they are known to be in existence now, because a few are missing some things.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.182
I think he's handled them all, you know.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.224
He's certainly had a go at it.

21:54.244 --> 21:55.386
That's fascinating.

21:55.486 --> 21:57.208
I love that story.

21:57.248 --> 21:58.730
That's a real census.

21:58.910 --> 22:06.540
Now, Bill Reese told me in San Francisco, you know, he sent around a little questionnaire about Catlin, about the American Indians.

22:06.660 --> 22:07.061
Oh, really?

22:07.521 --> 22:09.584
A questionnaire?

22:09.604 --> 22:11.286
To describe your copies.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.672
Also, Bill is doing something.

22:13.772 --> 22:17.877
He's identified 15 separate issues of it.

22:17.897 --> 22:18.718
Oh, that's interesting.

22:19.779 --> 22:21.341
I've got to talk to Bill about this.

22:21.361 --> 22:22.482
He's going to write about it.

22:22.502 --> 22:24.224
He's going to do a book on it.

22:24.424 --> 22:27.688
And there are two here, you see.

22:27.828 --> 22:30.290
We have one, and the Royal Ontario Museum has one.

22:30.911 --> 22:41.543
Now, the reason this came up is that I haven't replied to his questionnaire yet from dilatory habits and

22:42.113 --> 22:45.818
But I've now promised him I will go and describe the copies.

22:45.838 --> 22:52.867
And, of course, I have to go and describe the one at Rahm, because there's nobody there that could do it.

22:54.109 --> 22:54.409
Thanks.

22:54.730 --> 22:55.551
Nope.

23:00.958 --> 23:02.340
That's great.

23:02.360 --> 23:09.589
There are all kinds of these things, like Tom Taylor took on the Octavo Audubon.

23:09.923 --> 23:12.526
and discovered all kinds of things.

23:12.747 --> 23:15.370
Nobody knew about the Octavo Audubon.

23:19.676 --> 23:30.310
But Gingrich is, sure, if you can find a book, there's a census of Vesalius as well.

23:34.475 --> 23:38.040
Vesalius, I think, didn't find its Gingrich, as it were.

23:38.459 --> 23:49.714
Well, of course, because that book is, see, the whole genesis of this thing is that he read someplace that's the greatest book he'd never read, you know?

23:49.734 --> 23:54.560
Well, I always thought Newton's Brunkehio was that, was the prime candidate.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.963
Copernicus is right up there, though, sure.

23:57.023 --> 24:02.590
And so he wanted to prove that this is not true, and maybe you can learn something from the individual copies.

24:02.610 --> 24:06.255
And to get a provenance for each book, I mean, that's really quite a...

24:06.775 --> 24:09.759
It's a nice story, I mean, and it does.

24:10.079 --> 24:14.645
And of course, reading, as Anthony Grafton says, he starts, he says, reading is hot right now.

24:15.406 --> 24:16.948
Just the whole study of reading.

24:17.248 --> 24:22.976
And it's all, and that's why I found his lecture just riveting.

24:22.996 --> 24:23.717
Just riveting.

24:23.757 --> 24:24.878
It was wonderful.

24:24.898 --> 24:25.840
He's wonderful.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.543
Lucky old Princeton students.

24:29.965 --> 24:31.907
You know, they've got Darden there.

24:31.987 --> 24:34.330
They had Natalie Davis as well.

24:34.371 --> 24:36.293
I talked to Fagels last week, and he says,

24:36.678 --> 24:38.360
I said, the graphic's coming up now.

24:38.601 --> 24:40.864
He says, those bastards better not steal them.

24:40.964 --> 24:41.926
I know they want to get them.

24:42.006 --> 24:47.153
He says, they've been trying to get him, take him from us for years.

24:47.514 --> 24:49.197
It's funny.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.398
He was great.

24:50.679 --> 24:52.521
That was a good meeting.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.685
In fact, I enjoyed that whole thing.

24:54.725 --> 24:57.268
This was my first year at Columbia this year.

24:57.629 --> 24:58.210
Oh, right.

24:58.310 --> 24:59.011
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:59.111 --> 25:00.173
It was fun.

25:00.193 --> 25:00.373
Yeah.

25:01.197 --> 25:02.799
We're doing fine.

25:02.859 --> 25:04.642
I'm going to go use the head.

25:04.662 --> 25:06.244
Okay, I'm talking to Father Farge.

25:06.865 --> 25:07.846
Okay.

25:08.127 --> 25:24.089
So, I'm just giving a little background to the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies that in the 1870s, Pope Leo XIII, he was a remarkable Pope.

25:24.890 --> 25:30.478
He got the Church interested in social justice, for example, with certain encyclicals, and

25:30.593 --> 25:35.441
He also wanted to give a better philosophical, theological foundation to Catholic theology.

25:35.501 --> 25:40.669
So he promoted, he advocated the return to the philosophy of St.

25:40.709 --> 25:42.712
Thomas Aquinas from the 13th century.

25:43.834 --> 25:49.803
And that started the whole vogue in the Catholic Church of studying the Middle Ages themselves.

25:50.825 --> 25:55.131
And the Brazilian Fathers, who had started St.

25:55.172 --> 25:58.677
Michael's here about that time, well, a little earlier, 1852,

25:59.062 --> 26:04.849
They were quite interested in this project in the 1900s, 1910, 1920s.

26:05.590 --> 26:12.138
And one of our men especially was interested in it, and they were doing philosophy here, trying to reorient it.

26:12.758 --> 26:16.603
And along from France came Etienne Gilson.

26:16.623 --> 26:17.384
Could you spell that for me?

26:17.885 --> 26:20.968
G-I-L-S-O-N, Gilson.

26:21.709 --> 26:25.213
And he was kind of disgusted with the way things were in France.

26:25.354 --> 26:29.018
He was looking for something new where

26:30.263 --> 26:44.321
philosophy, which he was a philosopher, he could study that in its complete medieval context, rather than just in a philosophical, one-faceted angle.

26:44.822 --> 26:53.633
So he and this other man, Henry Carr, got together in the 1920s and decided they would begin a project here to study the Middle Ages.

26:54.674 --> 26:58.279
Specifically Aquinas, or just the Middle Ages?

26:59.339 --> 27:04.424
behind it all, but no, they didn't want to just be narrow about it.

27:04.504 --> 27:06.626
They wanted to set the whole thing together.

27:07.307 --> 27:25.684
So they started the Institute of Medieval Studies, and our religious order, the Brazilian Fathers, sent off five or six people right away to Europe to get degrees in medieval things, canon law and philosophy and theology and history and literature.

27:26.052 --> 27:30.997
So they continued to do that, and this place built up, of course— This place meaning here?

27:31.117 --> 27:32.719
The Pontifical Institute, yeah.

27:33.019 --> 27:39.726
Now, was this—were the fathers active elsewhere in the world, or were they really focusing this attention here?

27:39.746 --> 27:47.753
Oh, well, they were growing through this time, so they were starting new places throughout Canada, several colleges, small Catholic colleges.

27:47.774 --> 27:49.916
But this particular exercise that you're talking about was right here.

27:49.936 --> 27:50.256
Oh, that's here.

27:50.276 --> 27:51.317
It's focused right here.

27:51.736 --> 28:03.074
And then in 1939, they got the Pontifical Charter from the Vatican to give degrees on the authority of the Holy See.

28:03.094 --> 28:04.656
And so we've been doing that.

28:05.878 --> 28:14.672
The whole idea was to take people who were interested in the Middle Ages and do what Gielsen wanted to do, and not simply

28:15.935 --> 28:26.167
be a person who knew medieval philosophy or medieval literature or medieval history, but someone who was familiar with the culture of the period.

28:26.608 --> 28:42.988
So what the Institute has tried to do over the past 60, 70 years is form students who have this broad-based interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary approach to medieval culture.

28:43.306 --> 28:55.922
that they will know the literature, philosophy, theology, law, history, and art.

28:57.704 --> 29:08.217
And also, we put very heavy emphasis on training people to read the original documents, that is, to know Latin well enough and to be able to read the

29:08.585 --> 29:10.888
Are these undergraduate students?

29:10.908 --> 29:13.991
No, they're all graduate students.

29:14.011 --> 29:14.152
Okay.

29:14.252 --> 29:19.097
And are they preparing for the lives of the priesthood?

29:19.197 --> 29:19.878
No, no.

29:19.978 --> 29:21.580
Very few of them are.

29:21.941 --> 29:25.265
Most of them have been lay students going out to .

29:25.285 --> 29:25.325
.

29:25.345 --> 29:25.365
.

29:25.385 --> 29:26.626
So they're scholars.

29:26.646 --> 29:28.628
Yeah, yeah, going out.

29:28.648 --> 29:34.255
You know, we've got people teaching all across the United States who were trained here.

29:34.589 --> 29:39.716
In the 40s and 50s and 60s, we were pretty well doing that on our own here in Toronto.

29:40.096 --> 29:49.889
And then in the middle 60s, the University of Toronto kind of caught on, and they began to organize a center for medieval studies.

29:49.950 --> 29:52.213
Were you independent at that time?

29:52.233 --> 29:53.634
Yes, that's right, that's right.

29:55.817 --> 30:00.023
So from the 60s, we've kind of collaborated with the university

30:00.728 --> 30:03.091
We've done a lot of the teaching.

30:03.291 --> 30:09.840
They've helped us with some money, and so the place has grown.

30:10.240 --> 30:14.385
Now, the library has been totally the work of the Pontifical Institute.

30:14.405 --> 30:17.629
The university has had practically nothing to do with that.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.633
You mentioned original sources.

30:20.653 --> 30:25.019
Could you explain a little bit about that, the philosophy of that, and how you acquired these things?

30:25.279 --> 30:29.925
Well, we've tried to acquire as many printed books

30:30.715 --> 30:41.987
as we can find, that with original texts from the Middle Ages, whether they're printed in the early centuries of printing or, you know, like the 16th, 17th century.

30:43.689 --> 30:47.874
Now, for manuscripts, we haven't had the money to go around buying manuscripts.

30:47.894 --> 30:50.837
But what we have done is bought a lot of microfilms.

30:50.977 --> 30:57.044
We have 8,000 reels of microfilm of manuscripts, you see.

30:57.224 --> 31:00.688
So we have a huge collection of manuscripts on microfilm.

31:01.208 --> 31:10.999
And the idea was to be able to read the text and then be able to interpret them in the sort of broad context of medieval culture.

31:11.479 --> 31:21.731
Richard had mentioned something during lunch that you are embarked on a project, a bibliographical project, involving Aquinas that may take 300 years.

31:22.732 --> 31:27.317
Is that, is that, are you familiar at all with that as a major?

31:27.483 --> 31:38.076
Well, he might be talking about the Leonine edition of Aquinas, which we have had, a few of our people have worked on it, but it's not centered here.

31:38.116 --> 31:39.317
It's centered in Rome.

31:40.579 --> 31:44.483
And there's, for a while, there was a branch of it in Yale.

31:45.665 --> 31:49.429
And it's a critical edition of the works of St.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.350
Thomas Aquinas.

31:50.371 --> 31:52.153
Leonine, L-E-O-N-I-N-A?

31:52.333 --> 31:54.115
Right, the Leonine Commission.

31:54.736 --> 31:56.378
They got off to a bad start.

31:56.438 --> 32:01.863
They printed several volumes that turned out to be not very well done.

32:01.883 --> 32:03.705
So now they're having to redo those.

32:04.846 --> 32:15.396
But the problem is, you know, they still have a lot of work to do, but the people who want to do that are growing fewer and fewer and older and older.

32:16.958 --> 32:22.043
The original sort of emphasis on Thomas Aquinas is pretty well gone.

32:22.782 --> 32:25.645
We've got a lot of editions of his works here.

32:25.805 --> 32:29.249
We've got all his manuscripts on microfilm, etc.

32:29.589 --> 32:31.712
But there aren't too many people studying him anymore.

32:32.052 --> 32:37.918
But the vogue for studying the Middle Ages is quite, as you know, quite strong.

32:37.938 --> 32:40.501
Do you have an explanation for that?

32:40.701 --> 32:41.802
It's a cyclical thing.

32:41.883 --> 32:42.323
It's funny.

32:42.944 --> 32:47.929
See, the Catholic Church promoted Aquinas for nearly a century.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.282
And then it kind of got away from it.

32:50.382 --> 33:09.341
With the Vatican, the Second Vatican Council, it sort of started, rather than look at that scholastic medieval foundation as a foundation for theology, it turned to more to scripture.

33:09.782 --> 33:17.950
And a lot of emphasis has been done now informing people to read the, you know, to be scripture scholars and to

33:18.318 --> 33:24.468
based theology, as it was done in the first few centuries of the Church, on commentaries on scripture.

33:25.609 --> 33:29.776
And that's what the vogue in the Catholic Church has been in the last twenty or thirty years.

33:29.976 --> 33:41.975
Now, the administration of the pontifical medievalists, is it a part of the university, or is it something that's... Technically, we're a graduate center in St.

33:42.055 --> 33:43.718
Michael's College.

33:44.153 --> 33:45.514
area around here is St.

33:45.574 --> 33:46.295
Michael's College.

33:46.335 --> 33:48.337
We're on the fourth floor of their library.

33:50.419 --> 33:51.000
So St.

33:51.060 --> 33:57.466
Michael's College is a federated university now within the University of Toronto.

33:57.807 --> 34:00.009
But it's independent, but it's federated.

34:01.190 --> 34:08.477
And there's, you see, there's a federated Anglican College, Trinity.

34:09.158 --> 34:12.321
There's a federated United Church College, which is Victoria.

34:12.605 --> 34:18.811
And there's a federated Catholic college in the University of Toronto.

34:18.831 --> 34:23.836
And then there are several colleges that are sort of non-sectarian, the part of it.

34:23.856 --> 34:28.681
And your holdings, the Pontifical Institute, how large is your library?

34:28.701 --> 34:30.202
Would you just estimate it?

34:30.222 --> 34:40.873
Ninety to a hundred thousand printed volumes, as I say, all focused on the Middle Ages.

34:42.659 --> 34:46.345
I don't know that we have a better collection, say, than Harvard.

34:46.365 --> 34:47.326
I don't think we do.

34:48.408 --> 34:50.851
But it's all concentrated right here.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.814
It's easy to put your hands on it.

34:52.874 --> 34:58.723
You can, it's not spread out, you know, among the various disciplines, as it would be at the Widener Library.

34:58.743 --> 35:02.348
But if you don't have a better collection than Harvard, you probably might have the second-best collection.

35:02.368 --> 35:02.789
We might.

35:03.650 --> 35:07.556
We might, frankly, in the Middle Ages, in North America.

35:08.678 --> 35:12.143
But, as I say— How does this happen just through the will of these original

35:13.085 --> 35:18.289
Yeah, and they got some people to help, you know, with some money.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.031
We've got a bit of a foundation.

35:20.091 --> 35:35.484
We're struggling with it right now, but people give us... The thing is, you could buy a lot of these books cheap in the 30s, and Gielsen really went all over Europe buying books.

35:35.804 --> 35:37.966
He actively went out and bought himself.

35:37.986 --> 35:38.166
Oh, yeah.

35:38.186 --> 35:40.408
He didn't leave us to surrogates and all.

35:40.428 --> 35:42.670
See, he divided his time...

35:43.190 --> 35:47.375
Six months in Europe, six months here, every year.

35:48.657 --> 35:50.900
And he'd buy books in Europe.

35:50.920 --> 35:59.892
And see, he was a man who was in the Académie Française, which is about as high as you can get, and in the Collège de France.

36:00.973 --> 36:07.982
So he was constantly invited all over the world to give lectures.

36:08.283 --> 36:10.005
and to get honorary degrees.

36:10.065 --> 36:14.010
We have about 40 of his honorary degrees in our rare book group.

36:14.030 --> 36:18.095
And so wherever he went, he would buy books.

36:18.115 --> 36:20.157
Was he interested in rarity?

36:20.177 --> 36:23.661
He was interested in texts.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.504
It wasn't in the value of the book.

36:25.564 --> 36:28.447
It was in what the text was.

36:29.168 --> 36:32.112
So really, in his mind, this was to be a working library?

36:32.132 --> 36:32.472
Yes.

36:33.674 --> 36:38.239
We have not tried to acquire things that are worth a lot of money.

36:38.573 --> 36:40.175
For that purpose alone?

36:40.255 --> 36:40.475
No.

36:40.535 --> 36:44.219
Unless, of course, it happens to be something that's essential.

36:44.239 --> 36:44.860
That's right.

36:45.100 --> 36:45.961
But, I mean, no.

36:47.623 --> 36:54.771
And as I say, a lot of this he was able to buy fairly cheaply in the 30s and in the 40s and 50s as well.

36:55.571 --> 37:02.379
And he was active until he was in his 80s, and he used to come here every year until he was about 87.

37:02.499 --> 37:05.202
And when did he pass away?

37:05.222 --> 37:07.264
I think in 79.

37:08.780 --> 37:12.906
And so, you know, he did a lot of this work himself.

37:12.966 --> 37:14.268
He was an extraordinary man.

37:14.368 --> 37:22.559
He wrote a book on just about every major philosopher in the Middle Ages, plus poets, you know, a book on Dante.

37:22.579 --> 37:26.645
I mean, he... I'll check him out.

37:26.665 --> 37:27.125
Just spell his name.

37:27.205 --> 37:27.926
Gielson.

37:29.228 --> 37:31.051
G-I-L-S-O-N-A-T-N.

37:32.172 --> 37:37.840
We have under his name at least 1,100 separate items.

37:37.860 --> 37:37.960
Jeez.

37:38.783 --> 37:43.348
Because his works were translated into every language.

37:43.368 --> 37:43.828
Is it written of him?

37:44.089 --> 37:44.389
Yes.

37:45.690 --> 37:47.532
One of our men wrote it.

37:48.814 --> 37:51.377
Larry Shook, Lawrence, S-H-O-O-K.

37:52.398 --> 37:54.100
S-H-O, I'll find that at Harvard.

37:54.200 --> 37:54.700
Oh, sure.

37:55.101 --> 37:56.362
Sure, you'll find it there.

37:57.123 --> 37:59.145
I thought that Boyle came from here, isn't that right?

37:59.165 --> 37:59.726
Yes, yes.

37:59.866 --> 38:01.988
And I, by the way, I'll be going to Italy.

38:02.048 --> 38:07.474
How would I go about contacting to get Leonard Boyle?

38:07.640 --> 38:11.344
an introduction to the Vatican Library, which I want to include in this new book.

38:12.225 --> 38:15.068
Well, probably write him.

38:15.088 --> 38:34.508
I could—you give me your card, and I can certainly—I mean, one of our secretaries here is in the habit of calling him quite a bit.

38:34.589 --> 38:37.372
She can mention your name.

38:37.392 --> 38:40.755
I'm author of a book called The Gentle Madness, which I think I mentioned to you.

38:41.015 --> 38:44.078
Okay, that's the kind of thing that might appeal to Leonard Boyle.

38:44.258 --> 38:46.560
He's not a stuffy academic.

38:46.580 --> 38:55.308
Well, this is a survey of libraries that have been so significant through history, also libraries of the future and the relevance of books as we enter the new millennium.

38:55.329 --> 38:57.831
Want me to write the title of my book on that card?

38:57.851 --> 38:58.111
Yeah, please.

38:58.131 --> 38:58.712
I'm sorry, Father.

38:58.732 --> 38:59.813
Why don't you just continue?

39:00.013 --> 39:04.377
As you know, when the

39:05.150 --> 39:11.782
Library of Congress began, three or four years ago, its series on great libraries of the world.

39:12.823 --> 39:15.809
The first library they chose was the Vatican Library, right?

39:16.049 --> 39:16.770
Yes, sir.

39:16.790 --> 39:17.572
Were you there for that?

39:17.872 --> 39:18.173
No.

39:18.453 --> 39:18.553
Okay.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.577
Well, of course, yeah, of course.

39:20.597 --> 39:23.582
I have the Yale book.

39:23.602 --> 39:23.822
Yeah, okay.

39:23.842 --> 39:25.445
I'm sorry, I was thinking of something else.

39:25.465 --> 39:25.866
Yeah, yeah.

39:25.886 --> 39:26.227
Of course, yeah.

39:26.247 --> 39:29.352
I've been to every one of those.

39:29.787 --> 39:34.452
Naturally, if you're writing about libraries, you have to go to the Vatican Library.

39:37.716 --> 39:40.679
But, yes, Father Boyle used to teach paleography here.

39:42.921 --> 39:49.188
In other words, he teach students how to read those squiggly little old handwritings.

39:51.070 --> 39:53.753
This is the title of my book and my publisher.

39:54.830 --> 39:58.615
I'm talking about that book tonight.

39:58.635 --> 40:00.037
That's why I'm here.

40:00.057 --> 40:01.859
I've been invited to talk about that book.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.161
Bibliophiles.

40:03.381 --> 40:03.582
Files.

40:03.942 --> 40:05.164
Bibliomains.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.068
And the eternal passion for books.

40:08.088 --> 40:09.069
That's my book in print.

40:09.109 --> 40:13.415
And this new one will be not a sequel, but a companion volume.

40:13.695 --> 40:21.025
This one is more about the passion for collecting over 2,500 years, and how we owe so much to these collections that were put together.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.407
This will be a lot more difficult.

40:23.112 --> 40:29.239
This would be like deeper on libraries, libraries of the future, book culture.

40:29.559 --> 40:32.963
The canon wars, you know, is where they're really big down in the States.

40:34.124 --> 40:36.967
The canon meaning literary canon, like Shakespeare.

40:36.987 --> 40:39.090
Is Shakespeare still relevant, you know?

40:39.110 --> 40:43.395
I mean, I can imagine that we have questions that way, you know.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.597
Well, and they're doing a lot of very interesting people.

40:46.618 --> 40:49.001
Alberto Echol and St.

40:49.041 --> 40:51.904
Bartem Grubori on Saturday.

40:52.222 --> 40:56.747
Dr. Billington from the Library of Congress, public player there at the Public Library.

40:56.767 --> 40:57.768
Great.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.270
And I wanted to go to England in two weeks.

41:00.851 --> 41:02.453
So it's going to be very comprehensive.

41:02.473 --> 41:03.714
The Vatican is essential.

41:03.814 --> 41:08.139
I would love to have an interview with Bobby Boyle.

41:08.159 --> 41:09.500
Should I party on this?

41:09.580 --> 41:15.346
The thing with that is do some reading first on the Vatican Library.

41:16.628 --> 41:18.870
Leonard doesn't like somebody coming in

41:19.222 --> 41:20.703
Just knowing nothing.

41:20.723 --> 41:22.465
I mean, you know, from scratch.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.766
Check my book.

41:23.786 --> 41:24.147
Okay.

41:24.567 --> 41:26.849
My book was a finalist last year for the National Book Critics.

41:26.869 --> 41:28.811
No, I mean, do some reading on his library.

41:28.831 --> 41:31.354
Well, I wouldn't go there if I were able to do it.

41:31.374 --> 41:31.874
Yeah, okay.

41:32.275 --> 41:36.519
Because he'll be turned off if you come and want him to start from scratch.

41:37.439 --> 41:38.941
I never want to waste anybody's time.

41:39.001 --> 41:39.481
That's right.

41:40.162 --> 41:42.845
I just learned about you yesterday, by the way.

41:42.865 --> 41:45.347
This is why...

41:45.901 --> 41:46.582
Yeah.

41:46.602 --> 41:55.210
And he's the head of the Slavic division at NYPL, and he said, if you're going to Toronto, you must go here.

41:55.330 --> 42:02.236
So this was yesterday morning, and so that's why it seems like I'm ignorant of what's going on here.

42:02.256 --> 42:08.522
Trust me, I've only known about you for 24 hours.

42:08.542 --> 42:09.303
What's your full name?

42:09.363 --> 42:13.187
James Farge, F-A-R-G.

42:13.547 --> 42:15.469
Do you use a middle initial?

42:15.803 --> 42:19.228
The Reverend, right?

42:19.248 --> 42:19.328
Hmm.

42:19.348 --> 42:19.609
Yeah.

42:20.089 --> 42:21.672
Yeah.

42:21.692 --> 42:21.892
Okay.

42:21.912 --> 42:23.394
And you're the librarian here?

42:23.414 --> 42:24.816
I am, yes.

42:24.836 --> 42:24.936
Okay.

42:24.956 --> 42:27.159
But I'm not a professional librarian.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.361
I'm a historian.

42:28.381 --> 42:28.521
Uh-huh.

42:29.283 --> 42:30.925
And what are you a historian of?

42:31.606 --> 42:34.931
My main interest is the history of the University of Paris.

42:37.074 --> 42:43.363
Most of the things I've published have been on the Paris University in the sixteenth century.

42:44.525 --> 42:50.413
At least I've published five books about the University of Paris in the 16th century.

42:50.433 --> 42:58.884
So that's, you know, a narrow little corner, but... To jump back before I forget, should I write a letter to Father Boyle and reference this conversation?

42:58.904 --> 43:09.738
I would, but as I say, I'll have this secretary... I'd like to do something formal on it, and that way I can propose to him what it is I'm doing and why I want to come... Sure.

43:10.579 --> 43:11.781
I'll have the secretary...

43:12.115 --> 43:16.100
tell him that you're going to write.

43:16.140 --> 43:17.261
That's right.

43:17.282 --> 43:24.991
I want to come in June sometime, and it will be part of a broad Italian segment.

43:25.011 --> 43:32.421
There's going to be a chapter in this book on Eastern European book culture, Sarajevo.

43:32.761 --> 43:35.364
I understood you were particularly interested in that.

43:35.505 --> 43:40.671
The Soviet Union and what this means to book culture, and that's just one chapter.

43:41.410 --> 43:52.287
See, I was telling you on the phone yesterday that there's two or three people who want to raise some money for what they call the... I might have this wrong.

43:52.327 --> 43:54.951
The glogolitic collection.

43:55.031 --> 43:57.215
Now, that has to do with Croatia.

43:58.457 --> 43:59.659
Croatian culture.

44:00.440 --> 44:06.810
You'll have to look it up and get the right... See, it's not my area at all, but I think they call it glogolitic.

44:07.583 --> 44:09.085
How do you think it might stop?

44:09.105 --> 44:13.171
I think it's G-L-A-G-O-L-I-T-I-C.

44:13.631 --> 44:15.454
G-O-L-I-T-I-C.

44:15.514 --> 44:16.555
Glagolitic.

44:18.698 --> 44:18.919
Glagolitic.

44:19.019 --> 44:19.960
I'll check it on the internet.

44:19.980 --> 44:20.741
You never know.

44:20.761 --> 44:26.810
And it has to do with Croatian stuff.

44:28.232 --> 44:35.241
I wish I knew more about it, but they want to have a little center here for glagolitic culture.

44:35.281 --> 44:35.742
Here, meaning?

44:36.042 --> 44:36.443
In this...

44:36.878 --> 44:37.379
Right here.

44:37.899 --> 44:38.220
Are you kidding?

44:38.400 --> 44:39.201
Yeah.

44:39.221 --> 44:43.166
And are these people from expatriates?

44:43.206 --> 44:43.346
Yes.

44:43.587 --> 44:44.868
They're people from there.

44:44.908 --> 44:45.429
That's right.

44:45.689 --> 44:46.430
And what do they want to do?

44:46.450 --> 44:50.696
They want to set up and deposit their own materials from Croatia?

44:50.736 --> 44:55.181
They want to raise money to buy materials on that culture.

44:55.201 --> 44:55.642
That's spectacular.

44:55.662 --> 44:56.423
Yeah.

44:56.443 --> 44:57.825
Well, we'd like to do it.

44:58.085 --> 45:01.870
We don't have the money to tell them to do it, but if they give us the money, we'll do it.

45:01.910 --> 45:04.814
They'll certainly give it a happy and safe home.

45:04.834 --> 45:05.595
That's right.

45:05.655 --> 45:05.755
Yeah.

45:06.089 --> 45:11.076
Is this kind of developing out of Canada, this particular thing?

45:11.096 --> 45:12.338
I wonder why they picked you from this.

45:14.201 --> 45:27.761
Well, there is a center here in Toronto for the study of Croatian culture, but it's just a sort of, you know, one-person operation.

45:27.801 --> 45:31.827
It doesn't have a library except a personal library of one person.

45:32.296 --> 45:36.202
And she, I can't tell you her name, Kunik or something like that.

45:36.222 --> 45:37.924
Maybe when I call you back, you might have it.

45:38.305 --> 45:39.947
Why don't they want to do this in Croatia?

45:42.270 --> 45:44.133
I'm not in on it.

45:44.193 --> 45:45.775
Father Dimnik is in on this.

45:45.815 --> 45:47.017
You see what I'm saying?

45:47.037 --> 45:53.927
Because this is very interesting, because during the whole Soviet period, they were set up outside of those Eastern European countries.

45:56.771 --> 45:58.514
This would be one of those, perhaps.

45:58.534 --> 46:01.678
But you see, here it would be... It would be...

46:02.367 --> 46:07.490
I believe the period they're talking about is like the 7th to the 10th century.

46:10.383 --> 46:12.090
Test, test, test, test, test.
