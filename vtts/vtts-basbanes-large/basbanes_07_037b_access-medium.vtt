00:04.148 --> 00:09.357
You know, the first book written on salad, I just want to pick up on that.

00:09.577 --> 00:24.283
Well, I was very good friends with the people I love still, but, you know, when you live 72 years and you make friends,

00:24.837 --> 00:36.996
with people at the age of 40 who have 60 and 70 at that time.

00:37.477 --> 00:41.323
That's extraordinary.

00:41.343 --> 00:42.705
That's really something.

00:43.286 --> 00:46.892
And you know, it tastes really good.

00:46.912 --> 00:50.878
Shall we shut this off while we get there?

00:51.382 --> 00:56.009
She has a touch again.

00:56.029 --> 00:57.800
Hi, Ben.

00:57.961 --> 00:58.725
Hi, Ben.

00:58.925 --> 01:12.639
to a very good school, and like all the kids in my country, in Harvard.

01:12.719 --> 01:13.860
Thank you.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.585
And would you have a mercy now?

01:18.605 --> 01:18.925
I would like it.

01:18.945 --> 01:26.012
I learned in the school how to learn.

01:25.992 --> 01:41.676
And I really want to learn everything possible about cooking.

01:41.696 --> 01:46.684
So I was very curious about every book I read.

01:47.086 --> 01:49.889
I want to know everything I could.

01:52.513 --> 02:14.680
And I always have that feeling that, well, if I buy a book, and then the second, the third one, and the tenth one,

02:14.660 --> 02:29.389
And from 10 books that I paid $100, I've got one recipe that I can use.

02:29.409 --> 02:34.278
That's why I'll support the next 30 books.

02:34.298 --> 02:36.803
Did you find recipes in all books that you used?

02:37.357 --> 02:41.663
Can you think of any out there?

02:41.683 --> 02:41.903
Yes.

02:42.004 --> 02:53.300
For 25 years, we used in my restaurant a boiled dressing, a salad dressing that I found in an old American cookbook.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.842
Boiled?

02:54.862 --> 02:57.105
So you boiled your salad dressing?

02:57.125 --> 02:57.205
Yes.

02:57.590 --> 03:02.279
I never heard of such.

03:02.359 --> 03:06.848
And that was the house special salad dressing?

03:06.868 --> 03:08.692
That was the only dressing.

03:14.263 --> 03:17.269
If you didn't like that dressing, you could have it.

03:17.249 --> 03:22.997
Oil and vinegar, and lemon juice, but no other dressing.

03:23.017 --> 03:24.980
What distinguished it?

03:25.040 --> 03:30.207
What made our salad dressing?

03:31.409 --> 03:46.851
I think it was the velvety texture, and the fact that the taste of the cream, and the taste of the cream, and the taste of the oil,

03:48.333 --> 03:54.589
pudding like starch, and then at the end, the last minute, you add the ice cubes and the herbs together.

03:54.870 --> 03:58.880
It gave a texture like no other dressing.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.742
Well, it wasn't sweet.

04:00.083 --> 04:04.013
It wasn't tangy or... It's kind of like a sweet sour, wouldn't you say?

04:05.596 --> 04:07.038
It was made with honey.

04:07.058 --> 04:08.540
Oh, it was made with honey.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.261
And mustard.

04:10.363 --> 04:13.167
We followed an order or something.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.691
And what did you follow in the restaurant?

04:15.751 --> 04:19.636
Did you give it any kind of... They gave it some dressing.

04:19.656 --> 04:20.097
That's great.

04:20.117 --> 04:25.745
And I've heard people ask you all the time, well, what's your recipe for this?

04:25.765 --> 04:26.707
And what did you tell them?

04:27.227 --> 04:28.750
We gave them the recipe.

04:28.770 --> 04:30.372
It was in my cookbook.

04:30.571 --> 04:56.595
which was published by the new york cards it was a pie magazine's best seller list any other uh entrees or something like that that you picked up in the collection we're in the collection

04:57.503 --> 05:02.350
based on famous Americans.

05:02.430 --> 05:09.639
How about, now these are American recipes, how about any continental things?

05:09.740 --> 05:12.924
Oh yeah, sure.

05:13.985 --> 05:24.760
What would you say was the most, what was your prize, did you have a single prize possession in the collection?

05:25.499 --> 05:30.051
Do you have any incutables, for instance?

05:30.071 --> 05:38.412
I have two or three.

05:39.016 --> 05:45.506
I think your trancher books work.

05:45.566 --> 05:47.569
Trancher, table-side carving.

05:47.589 --> 05:54.239
You had the Petit Manuscript, which was in itself a beauty.

05:54.259 --> 06:01.851
I owned a manuscript from the table-side carving written in French.

06:01.931 --> 06:02.492
Carving.

06:02.708 --> 06:18.308
And I owned the first German book on table-side carton, the first Italian, the first Spanish, the first Portuguese.

06:18.869 --> 06:23.055
And a table-side carton?

06:23.075 --> 06:29.543
I'm cutting up meat, meat, uh... Yes, fabulous.

06:30.029 --> 06:33.897
And you assemble these all individually or separately.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.793
I kept buying them, yes?

06:37.813 --> 06:40.235
Did you buy at auctions from dealers?

06:40.376 --> 06:43.559
How did you find them?

06:43.579 --> 07:02.077
You see, my great advantage of coming from a book-loving and book-collecting and book-buying family was... Thank you.

07:02.097 --> 07:02.297
You know,

07:02.817 --> 07:19.932
French Joseph, the emperor of Austria-Hungary, had a mistress, Catherine Schrapp, who was an actress at Catherine Schrapp.

07:20.384 --> 07:28.374
made a convenience marriage.

07:30.416 --> 07:43.793
She was married to a Hungarian nobleman, to a baron who was a diplomat.

07:44.262 --> 08:01.808
The diplomat's mother wrote a handwritten code book and gave it as a present to Catherine Schraub.

08:07.557 --> 08:08.238
How do you spell Catherine's name?

08:08.258 --> 08:08.498
S-C-H-R-A-T.

08:08.478 --> 08:14.668
The son of Katharish Rapa was called Baron Kish.

08:16.972 --> 08:30.655
He immigrated to England and when he died of his possession was

08:31.428 --> 08:42.742
sold an auction.

08:42.762 --> 08:51.232
On that auction was her cookbook, Kathleen Schrutz cookbook.

08:51.252 --> 08:59.342
And in the cookbook was with Kathleen Schrutz and writing the recipe for that

08:59.727 --> 09:08.776
basically the kugelhoops that the emperor ate every afternoon in her apartment.

09:10.358 --> 09:24.672
When the auction came up, Clifford Max, the Max Brothers, was at the auction and when this item came up he bought it for me.

09:24.652 --> 09:26.515
without asking me.

09:26.535 --> 09:33.625
He was so sure that I would want it, that he, whatever it would cost, he purchased it.

09:33.645 --> 09:34.126
He knew that?

09:36.349 --> 09:46.644
Because he knew me, he knew my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, I was his customer since years, my checks never bounced.

09:47.265 --> 09:52.853
He knew that being Hungarian, collecting coke book, I do want that book.

09:53.103 --> 09:54.145
And he was right.

09:54.246 --> 10:08.698
I was never upset when a book read the book.

10:08.678 --> 10:14.907
Probably I felt a little bit sorry, but not absolutely.

10:14.927 --> 10:15.067
Really?

10:15.087 --> 10:21.095
So many people say that their biggest regret is not how much money they spent on the editing, but the ones that got away.

10:21.175 --> 10:24.700
You know, you don't feel that way?

10:24.780 --> 10:24.900
No.

10:25.061 --> 10:27.524
Do you ever feel that maybe you spent too much for anything?

10:27.704 --> 10:28.425
Sometimes, very sadly.

10:28.485 --> 10:37.538
Usually if there was something that was written for that catalog rate, a more exceptional piece came up later that

10:37.518 --> 10:40.122
And it didn't matter.

10:41.063 --> 10:50.916
Don't you feel we always, like, a Lincoln or a Washington, we might have missed it or been too late to buy it, but there was always a better one that came up, more media?

10:52.398 --> 10:59.087
So what was the name of the pastry, by the way?

11:00.810 --> 11:03.733
You said it was a... Kugelhoop.

11:03.754 --> 11:04.074
Kugelhoop.

11:04.314 --> 11:04.875
K-U-G-E-L-H-U-P-F.

11:05.294 --> 11:06.761
Did you ever make it?

11:07.223 --> 11:07.907
No.

11:08.992 --> 11:10.680
Was it any great?

11:10.964 --> 11:14.929
I mean, he ate it every day.

11:14.989 --> 11:18.252
It must have been great.

11:18.272 --> 11:19.974
Did you ever make it in the restaurant?

11:20.555 --> 11:21.316
Sometimes.

11:21.336 --> 11:26.502
Really, the restaurant and the collection were separate entities.

11:26.522 --> 11:29.545
I think it's reaching to say that one energized the other.

11:30.567 --> 11:37.815
Well, I could never have the collection.

11:38.403 --> 11:41.906
We'd have the restaurant.

11:41.926 --> 11:44.929
But I certainly could have the restaurant we talked about.

11:44.949 --> 11:46.310
No question.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.773
I interviewed a guy in New York a couple of weeks ago.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.356
His name is Michael Zinman.

11:52.476 --> 11:53.657
Have you ever heard of him?

11:53.677 --> 11:53.897
No.

11:53.917 --> 11:57.841
He's got one of the finest collections of American imprints in the United States.

11:58.401 --> 12:02.044
And his business is easy to install birthworms.

12:02.064 --> 12:05.007
He sells caterpillar crackers.

12:05.027 --> 12:08.410
The point is, his collection has absolutely nothing to do business.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.975
See what I'm saying?

12:10.995 --> 12:23.918
The Westerns made the collection possible, but I don't... I think it's reaching, but it is, I find it really wonderful that you did collect in the area that you made your profession.

12:24.303 --> 12:34.033
Now, you really weren't always a professional chef in the restaurant store.

12:34.093 --> 12:38.018
You were trained as a psychologist, as I understand.

12:38.158 --> 12:48.669
Why didn't you collect books on psychology?

12:48.689 --> 12:49.129
Who told you I didn't?

12:49.149 --> 12:49.770
Is that right?

12:50.408 --> 12:51.169
Where are they?

12:52.231 --> 12:53.372
They go to Chicago.

12:53.453 --> 12:54.274
Still in my home.

12:54.294 --> 12:56.377
Oh, you kept them.

12:56.437 --> 12:59.662
So far, yes.

13:00.443 --> 13:02.446
That's wonderful.

13:03.187 --> 13:08.675
Now, when did you start collecting presidential signatures?

13:08.695 --> 13:13.723
You know, I never collected presidential signatures.

13:13.743 --> 13:16.467
Presidential autographs.

13:16.733 --> 13:28.228
I collected only material signed by American presidents if they wrote about food, drink, entertainment.

13:28.248 --> 13:29.609
That's all.

13:29.629 --> 13:30.891
And how did you find these?

13:30.911 --> 13:34.435
I mean, you had your shelves out there.

13:34.455 --> 13:37.099
You had the dealings?

13:37.119 --> 13:41.384
You see, the greatest joy is the hunt.

13:42.385 --> 13:44.428
You know?

13:44.881 --> 13:50.321
Only lazy, lousy hunters send out scouts.

13:50.783 --> 13:54.537
Good hunters go and shoot their stuff.

13:54.820 --> 14:00.027
Well, did you represent yourself at auctions?

14:00.047 --> 14:02.510
In the beginning when I was stupid.

14:03.312 --> 14:12.204
But you would locate, identify the item and then you would commission a dealer to get it.

14:12.524 --> 14:13.866
But you found the item.

14:13.966 --> 14:21.216
And sometimes I didn't even call the dealer to my commission why I won the title.

14:21.837 --> 14:38.169
Why don't you tell them the story about the auction of the Jefferson Unwind?

14:38.189 --> 14:38.530
Oh, good evening.

14:39.168 --> 14:49.081
We should be teaching about this place.

14:49.101 --> 14:49.622
It was about a shit house.

14:49.642 --> 14:54.729
So then we realized that we have to put it on money.

14:54.749 --> 14:57.733
That the change is fabulous.

14:58.085 --> 15:16.371
Barbara was with us since the day she left high school.

15:16.491 --> 15:24.582
She used to eat in our restaurant while she was in high school.

15:25.203 --> 15:35.394
She started in the restaurant at the rock bottom.

15:35.414 --> 15:52.392
She did really everything, scrubbing the floor, serving the food, and in the kitchen, giving out the food, and cutting the milk.

15:53.047 --> 16:08.109
ordering the wine, you name it, the most diverse things for the person.

16:08.129 --> 16:20.708
And my wife and myself and Barbara and my brother and my brother's wife, we've been the management of the rest of the world.

16:20.890 --> 16:28.200
And Barbara and I and my wife, we worked back here.

16:29.282 --> 16:35.010
From seven days in the morning till two o'clock in the morning.

16:35.070 --> 16:36.692
We took a break after night.

16:36.712 --> 16:38.595
My wife probably came in.

16:38.575 --> 16:53.578
She lay there because she did some paper work.

16:53.598 --> 16:55.801
But we took a break afternoon and kept working till one o'clock at night.

16:55.821 --> 16:57.844
Every day.

16:57.864 --> 17:00.448
And she did everything with me.

17:00.428 --> 17:03.156
I've worked up nights.

17:03.176 --> 17:08.151
Has anybody coffee, tea, and dessert there on fire?

17:09.214 --> 17:10.197
Coffee, coffee.

17:10.258 --> 17:10.759
Coffee, coffee.

17:11.077 --> 17:20.646
So, then she started to work with the books.

17:21.967 --> 17:37.962
You know, when I say with the books, that means with the menus, with the hotel ephemera,

17:37.942 --> 18:03.460
with old American newspapers where she was marking every food-related item, with old almanacs, calendars, American history books, with all the American periodicals of the 19th century.

18:04.662 --> 18:07.206
Anything and everything was hard to do

18:07.186 --> 18:22.623
with life, because coming from a background of psychology, I feel that to live means to eat, and to eat means to live.

18:23.223 --> 18:33.835
If you say this is a living being, that means this is something what consumes, what divorces.

18:34.439 --> 18:39.600
what nourishes itself.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.171
So, that

18:42.404 --> 19:05.357
makes it very important that you look at food not only of something physiological, but also of psychological and spiritual.

19:05.337 --> 19:18.095
All the religions are based in food.

19:18.115 --> 19:23.262
So you brought intellectual baggage to your profession, not just culinary skills.

19:23.613 --> 19:36.913
very anti-male wisdom, because Madam Mao said that she much rather sees the schools

19:37.450 --> 19:52.500
educating electricians who know how to put in a light bulb than electro-engineers who know the theory of electricity.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.167
That's why they collapsed, you know.

19:56.187 --> 19:59.914
So probably I was not the best on

20:00.299 --> 20:01.841
putting in the light bulbs.

20:02.362 --> 20:06.207
But I know pretty much the theory of Alexis.

20:06.527 --> 20:08.370
You know what I mean?

20:08.390 --> 20:09.992
I know what you're saying.

20:10.012 --> 20:12.095
But your restaurant was very highly respected.

20:12.936 --> 20:15.780
Oh, absolutely.

20:15.860 --> 20:16.361
I'm amused.

20:16.441 --> 20:18.223
I saw a few reviews on it.

20:18.283 --> 20:21.488
I thought that you hadn't kept up with the fashions.

20:21.508 --> 20:25.353
You know, the yuppie fashions, I guess.

20:25.373 --> 20:28.177
May I have anything to drive them?

20:28.357 --> 20:28.938
Very good.

20:28.958 --> 20:29.158
Thank you.

20:30.168 --> 20:44.168
Food critics, so-called food critics, are very fickle, very jealous, very stupid people.

20:44.188 --> 20:48.053
And very frankly, I did look balanced.

20:49.114 --> 20:56.665
And very early in the game, I figured out

20:56.847 --> 20:58.255
what they are doing.

20:59.120 --> 21:04.410
They are like a pack of wolves and

21:04.913 --> 21:12.165
When a new restaurant starts and gets successful, then they gang up.

21:12.185 --> 21:12.886
Let's kill it.

21:14.208 --> 21:17.413
You know?

21:17.493 --> 21:22.822
When you were busy every night, people came back and... I know that I cannot avoid this.

21:24.244 --> 21:26.888
But I know how can I counteract.

21:27.222 --> 21:33.789
And what made them so angry that I can't have acted.

21:33.809 --> 21:48.103
Instead of making a city-wide base, I made a nation-wide base for my restaurant.

21:48.123 --> 21:52.588
And then I built an international reputation.

21:52.973 --> 22:04.590
so that the local assholes could not harm me, could not touch me, whatever they wrote.

22:05.311 --> 22:12.481
Because I was not only written up nation, but I was writing nation.

22:12.501 --> 22:18.390
I had a weekly column in the Sun Times which was in 117 newspapers.

22:18.370 --> 22:41.719
Now, how can a stupid Chicago, a stupid Chicago food writer who writes only for one little second-rate paper, how can he hurt me in Dallas, where the two Dallas papers are fighting which should bring my knowledge?

22:41.999 --> 22:43.281
Or in Austin?

22:43.565 --> 22:47.872
I mean, the only newspaper.

22:47.892 --> 22:52.039
So they were very spiky.

22:52.059 --> 22:55.404
I think it was a matter of jealousy.

22:55.424 --> 23:01.274
And the other thing is we had one journalist who went on a record and said, no runs could go beyond this history within 10 years, yet they should close it up and start a new war.

23:01.294 --> 23:03.297
What kind of a moron would make a statement like that?

23:03.337 --> 23:05.100
But explain your theory about...

23:05.080 --> 23:16.913
You see, the thing is, most of the people feel that restaurant is mama.

23:17.146 --> 23:29.203
And if the restaurant is too successful, that means that mother splits up her motherly love among too many people.

23:29.223 --> 23:31.226
And you don't want to.

23:31.246 --> 23:35.893
You rather kill mother than let mother like other kids.

23:35.913 --> 23:37.535
You know?

23:37.575 --> 23:40.620
Stupid child.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.242
And I have also

23:42.222 --> 23:49.195
The personnel done better against me by a guy.

23:49.215 --> 23:55.928
And then I backed him up nicely.

23:56.108 --> 23:58.813
I dropped him.

23:58.793 --> 24:22.033
One year after we are closed,

24:22.013 --> 24:29.283
You should read what he writes about me, but he is not wonderful.

24:29.303 --> 24:31.305
And how about the award they wrote when you were slipping?

24:31.446 --> 24:34.289
I think I'm so curious.

24:34.309 --> 24:40.578
The top 100 restaurants by business executives were ranked in the US and they wrote you a letter that you slipped on?

24:40.718 --> 24:40.798
Yes.

24:40.778 --> 24:50.316
And he wrote me a very polite letter that my ratings are not as high as last year.

24:50.737 --> 24:56.789
And I showed him, no worry, I've been closed since the last year.

24:59.233 --> 25:02.820
So you know, if I'm rated that high a year after I've closed,

25:02.800 --> 25:04.702
That's very good.

25:04.722 --> 25:05.063
That's funny.

25:05.083 --> 25:08.747
Barbara, you mentioned something about, to tell me a story about Thomas Jefferson.

25:08.767 --> 25:11.610
Thomas Jefferson.

25:11.670 --> 25:12.130
Oh, yes.

25:12.150 --> 25:21.901
Remember the food dealer from Marshall Field who was beating against you on the town of Jefferson, and it still sits in there safe.

25:22.142 --> 25:22.942
Yes.

25:22.962 --> 25:23.283
It's still that.

25:23.303 --> 25:32.453
You know, it was a wine list from a wine dealer from friends addressed to Thomas Jefferson.

25:32.804 --> 25:35.006
opening some fabulous wines.

25:35.066 --> 25:41.473
You know, he was the number one gourmet among our presidents.

25:41.513 --> 25:44.015
They just sold a bottle of his wine for $700,000.

25:44.035 --> 25:44.716
Yes.

25:47.158 --> 26:01.292
So, I felt, because I was buying wine from that company, and because I liked Jefferson at my end, the asking price was

26:01.272 --> 26:08.080
The estimated price was $1,000 to $1,500.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.584
That was 20 years ago.

26:13.767 --> 26:21.236
I said to my wife, go up to $5,000 if I want to help.

26:22.077 --> 26:26.622
I could afford it and I want to help.

26:26.872 --> 26:45.724
The young gentleman was the newly hired head of the rare book and autograph department of Marshall Field in Chicago.

26:46.008 --> 26:54.360
saw me bidding for this, so he started to bid against me.

26:54.380 --> 27:04.995
And I thought, oh, if you want to play this game, it's all right, I know how to play the game.

27:05.245 --> 27:09.930
We ran up to $47,000 of this piece of paper.

27:09.971 --> 27:11.272
$47,000?

27:11.292 --> 27:15.877
$47,000.

27:16.378 --> 27:18.280
And it was up to $47,000.

27:23.066 --> 27:24.267
It's still hard.

27:24.287 --> 27:27.311
There's no market for it.

27:27.331 --> 27:28.452
It's too much money.

27:28.432 --> 27:32.697
Well, we knew that, but it was like... Didn't you know what happens if you get it at 40,000?

27:33.758 --> 27:35.179
He was determined to get it.

27:35.540 --> 27:38.683
He called it a Louis Salmari after this.

27:38.844 --> 27:41.627
It's worth every nickel.

27:41.647 --> 27:46.712
I never rent anymore to auction to pay anything.

27:46.732 --> 27:49.736
If I rent, I let somebody do it.

27:49.856 --> 27:51.157
You're all looking for him to bid it.

27:51.237 --> 27:51.958
He's not there.

27:52.259 --> 28:00.067
And I failed to do something.

28:00.087 --> 28:06.674
I told my dear, if I want to go, I just think like this.

28:06.694 --> 28:11.760
Then I want to stop.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.283
I'm going to call myself.

28:15.303 --> 28:15.824
Remember what it's called?

28:15.844 --> 28:15.904
No.

28:15.924 --> 28:16.184
I don't know.

28:16.204 --> 28:20.169
Well, you know, we saw him, what, about three or seven years ago, he ran into this gentleman.

28:20.189 --> 28:20.289
Yeah.

28:20.309 --> 28:21.370
And he said that he would still look eligible.

28:21.390 --> 28:21.490
Yeah.

28:21.706 --> 28:22.947
I might just call and ask.

28:25.590 --> 28:27.252
This was about 20 years ago, right?

28:27.272 --> 28:29.094
And the auction was in Chicago?

28:29.154 --> 28:30.175
Maybe.

28:30.195 --> 28:33.599
18 years ago.

28:33.619 --> 28:35.160
Where was the auction?

28:35.180 --> 28:36.261
15 years ago.

28:36.381 --> 28:40.125
I don't know about that.

28:40.165 --> 28:42.308
You are with us since 20 years.

28:42.408 --> 28:46.632
You've been there two years, probably three years.

28:46.672 --> 28:47.393
You're in Chicago.

28:47.373 --> 28:51.677
Uh, wasn't it a handful?

28:51.978 --> 29:06.853
Oh, no, no, this was an auction at, uh, I'll talk about the name of the auction.

29:07.194 --> 29:10.517
No, no, it was on Hansel Gallery.

29:10.597 --> 29:12.279
H-A-N-S-E-L, or L-L?

29:13.480 --> 29:15.282
Yeah.

29:15.402 --> 29:16.283
I don't know.

29:16.735 --> 29:23.706
What does your wife think about all this?

29:23.806 --> 29:25.909
Does she share this passion?

29:26.149 --> 29:28.633
Oh, she loves it.

29:29.474 --> 29:34.902
And bronze, yeah.

29:34.963 --> 29:43.215
You know...

29:43.432 --> 29:46.035
That's very relative.

29:46.055 --> 29:47.637
No, no, no.

29:48.197 --> 30:08.560
But I try to think at the moment of purchase or later on or relative to the person's income when he buys it.

30:08.580 --> 30:12.865
I bought the petite.

30:13.132 --> 30:32.434
manuscript of the first book in French with about half the copper plates ready.

30:32.474 --> 30:35.477
The rest in the hand-drawn

30:35.845 --> 31:00.992
state of monsieur petit the outdoor chef who made petit you see he made the drawings and then he gave them to an agent and while he was making the book he died and this was his copies now i paid that book for three years i bought it

31:01.327 --> 31:10.510
from, what was his name in Paris, the most famous, now there will be the other one.

31:11.047 --> 31:22.921
They have it in Iowa, and I think the dealer has a little discreet for it.

31:22.961 --> 31:27.106
That's right, yes.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.908
The dealer has a little discreet for it.

31:29.009 --> 31:31.351
It doesn't matter.

31:31.371 --> 31:34.455
You paid it over three years is what you're saying.

31:34.435 --> 31:37.438
It was lots of money.

31:37.819 --> 31:39.160
Can you tell me how much?

31:39.260 --> 31:41.763
It was lots of money.

31:41.783 --> 31:42.523
How long ago?

31:43.184 --> 31:46.227
Oh, about 15 years ago.

31:46.247 --> 31:52.274
But you really, but you desperately wanted to have it.

31:52.394 --> 31:53.855
And you never regretted buying it.

31:53.976 --> 31:55.037
Oh, no, absolutely.

31:55.137 --> 31:58.480
This fellow I was telling you about, I interviewed in New York, Zinman, who's made a ton of money.

31:59.561 --> 32:03.025
But he said up until two years ago, and he never had spent a day in his life.

32:03.005 --> 32:08.110
that he didn't owe some money to a bookseller, that he wasn't in debt to a bookseller.

32:08.310 --> 32:13.715
Did you ever find yourself acquiring yourself to things to get books?

32:14.996 --> 32:19.681
In the beginning, yes, when I came to the United States.

32:19.701 --> 32:21.562
Many times I went out to work.

32:21.722 --> 32:28.649
I worked six days, and on the seventh day I went out to work because I needed money.

32:28.749 --> 32:31.932
I didn't owe money, but I needed the money to buy.

32:32.553 --> 32:40.886
Because coming from Europe, I didn't like to open.

32:40.906 --> 32:46.495
But you would define yourself some things to get a book of revenge.

32:46.515 --> 32:47.016
Lots of things.

32:47.036 --> 32:50.882
And you never regretted any of it, I guess.

32:50.862 --> 32:58.369
How about parting with the books, now that they're out of the building in Chicago?

32:58.389 --> 33:01.972
They're yours, it's the collection, the collection bears your name.

33:02.272 --> 33:06.396
You know, I think it's only one part that's nice.

33:06.416 --> 33:11.361
This is the first time you've seen these books on the floor.

33:11.381 --> 33:14.203
You mean today?

33:14.223 --> 33:14.324
Here.

33:14.344 --> 33:19.148
But the other thing is, when I came to Chicago more than 30 years ago,

33:20.900 --> 33:28.987
There was a fact, I didn't even live here in Chicago, I just came to visit to Chicago.

33:29.067 --> 33:34.812
And I really, fit off knowing, admired Frank Lloyd Wright.

33:35.132 --> 33:38.095
I admired what he was doing.

33:38.495 --> 33:49.405
And he gave a talk

33:50.245 --> 34:00.027
of the Chicago Press Club about the Mile High Building.

34:01.170 --> 34:04.778
And one of the...

34:05.011 --> 34:08.636
real young punks.

34:08.656 --> 34:30.208
Somebody who is like Donaldson on television, you know, that kind of abrasive, stupid, cocky, investigative reporter type of joker, said to him, Maestro,

34:30.695 --> 34:36.862
You think you will live that long to see that mile-high building?

34:36.882 --> 34:38.664
No.

34:38.684 --> 34:44.031
And you know, the room just froze.

34:44.511 --> 34:53.462
And Frank Lloyd Wright, who was six foot three or six foot four, and he just got a little bit of bed.

34:53.898 --> 35:12.526
that much now, around 18, and looked down on the guy, you know, and said, young man, I don't have to see because it stands my height in my heart.

35:12.546 --> 35:13.828
Now sit down.

35:13.848 --> 35:16.091
It stands my height in my height.

35:16.111 --> 35:16.612
That's right.

35:18.214 --> 35:20.057
So you see, the books,

35:20.628 --> 35:22.634
I'm in my heart.

35:23.135 --> 35:24.279
I don't have to see them.

35:27.548 --> 35:28.491
You know?

35:28.531 --> 35:34.047
That's the sense that I can even end it.

35:35.073 --> 35:36.955
You know, I'm writing about you and your collection.

35:37.216 --> 35:40.740
I visualize sentences as I use them.

35:40.760 --> 35:40.861
Yeah.

35:41.141 --> 35:44.786
But no, you know, this is the thing you still saw me on the phone.

35:44.806 --> 35:47.689
I still cry a little bit at night.

35:47.709 --> 35:49.712
Of course.

35:49.732 --> 35:50.273
Of course.

35:51.775 --> 35:52.976
That's very normal.

35:52.996 --> 35:54.278
That's part of love.

35:56.921 --> 36:00.005
I go back again to King Solomon with the Thousand Vibes.

36:00.947 --> 36:02.869
You know, when the guy gets old.

36:04.182 --> 36:07.068
That's very understanding.

36:07.168 --> 36:14.122
I got a little stuff here.

36:14.182 --> 36:18.450
I'd like to go back and see.

36:18.570 --> 36:25.043
I know it's getting a little late, so if I could just see a few of the things back at the...

36:25.023 --> 36:25.984
Well, we go back.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.045
That's how we plan.

36:27.506 --> 36:35.335
I don't want to hold you up too much tonight either.

36:36.536 --> 36:39.399
We figured that this evening is yours.

36:39.739 --> 36:45.706
I'm really very... I filled this whole notebook today.

36:45.726 --> 36:53.595
I haven't talked about... I read some things that you know are basically the inventor of frozen food packaging.

36:54.233 --> 36:57.493
They're consulted in the food processing position.

36:57.946 --> 37:03.354
Well, this is all really irrelevant, isn't it?

37:03.374 --> 37:04.535
It's not relevant.

37:04.555 --> 37:08.080
It's relevant, because it's given to the wherewithal to indulge the passion.

37:08.201 --> 37:10.784
Not only that, but, you know, yes.

37:11.706 --> 37:17.053
You see, this is the type of the story, like, the captain who is captain for 20 years.

37:17.935 --> 37:24.344
You know, the captain who is a captain for 20 years without promotion.

37:24.384 --> 37:26.026
That's right, Heather.

37:26.587 --> 37:26.687
Good.

37:26.667 --> 37:31.714
own and operate a food service management company.

37:33.517 --> 37:43.931
And of course I was in the 50% and above tax bracket for three years.

37:44.051 --> 37:53.164
And because I came from Europe and I went through hell, I never ever want to and never ever did cheat on my taxes.

37:55.068 --> 38:04.601
But I had certain ways I learned to be able to cope with it.

38:04.621 --> 38:10.249
I have a large corporation here as my client.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.415
And they asked me to do something.

38:14.435 --> 38:16.818
And they said, how much we owe you?

38:17.959 --> 38:23.647
And I said, you know what?

38:23.667 --> 38:24.248
I saw...

38:24.802 --> 38:27.426
at such and such bookstore.

38:28.328 --> 38:29.931
There's three beautiful books.

38:31.693 --> 38:33.557
Money is a present, the three books.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.901
You don't owe me any.

38:35.921 --> 38:36.742
That's nice.

38:37.904 --> 38:39.807
And you did this often?

38:41.525 --> 38:46.690
I gave 22,000 photos to the University of Iowa.

38:47.131 --> 39:00.063
A certain percentage of that I get as gifts from corporations.

39:00.083 --> 39:07.971
I don't want you to write, I want you to understand.

39:08.508 --> 39:11.072
The value of books.

39:11.513 --> 39:18.665
What is the value of a book when you want to buy it or want to sell it?

39:19.366 --> 39:19.787
Who knows?

39:19.987 --> 39:24.154
One question you never bought for investment.

39:24.134 --> 39:27.380
I did buy for investment.

39:27.620 --> 39:29.022
Stocks and real estate.

39:29.163 --> 39:30.545
I mean books.

39:30.565 --> 39:31.667
No.

39:31.707 --> 39:33.430
That's important.

39:33.450 --> 39:33.510
No.

39:33.530 --> 39:36.695
Because any book collector who buys for investment is not a book collector.

39:36.715 --> 39:38.939
It's the stupid ass who marries for money.

39:41.924 --> 39:43.527
Okay.

39:43.507 --> 39:48.997
You said that you've kind of placed the value of two million on the Johnson and Wales collection.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.546
How about the one in Iowa?

39:53.726 --> 39:55.810
And Chicago for that better.

39:55.830 --> 40:03.945
I think both I can see...

40:03.925 --> 40:10.937
very modestly in the highest six figures.

40:10.957 --> 40:18.590
You mean the Hungarian collection and the Krupport collection?

40:18.610 --> 40:18.811
Of course.

40:18.831 --> 40:19.913
I think the Krupport collection.

40:20.173 --> 40:23.038
You mean not a million or under a million?

40:23.058 --> 40:23.238
Oh yeah.

40:23.258 --> 40:24.280
Let me explain this.

40:25.070 --> 40:32.021
You will understand what I will say now.

40:32.502 --> 40:50.790
If I gave 22,000 cookbooks and I hired, because according to the new tax laws, I would be the one who would have to hire and pay

40:51.091 --> 41:09.606
the appraiser, and if he would have to spend three months to check the price of 22,000 gold books, then I would have to pay

41:09.586 --> 41:17.138
they usually charge 110 to 125 dollars an hour.

41:17.158 --> 41:22.807
Eight dollars, eight hours a day, five days a week.

41:22.827 --> 41:26.953
That would be approximately a four month job.

41:28.135 --> 41:33.383
So when I ask an appraiser, I say, look,

41:35.118 --> 41:37.565
Here is a list of 4,000 books.

41:38.167 --> 41:46.329
I marked all the books which are over $300.

41:48.094 --> 41:50.140
I also marked the books which are

41:50.457 --> 41:57.645
in my estimation $200 to $300.

41:57.665 --> 42:04.492
I mark the ones which are between $50 and $200.

42:04.612 --> 42:09.897
And the rest, every book is $30.

42:12.740 --> 42:16.144
Count how many we are.

42:16.327 --> 42:32.287
make it so that you make 800 books $40, 400 books $30, 1,100 books $20, and 2,000 books $10.

42:33.849 --> 42:36.793
And the IRS will always agree.

42:37.074 --> 42:44.443
One year they challenged me, and they said, we are sending out two experts.

42:46.229 --> 42:47.538
to examine.

42:47.558 --> 42:49.309
They spent two weeks in my place.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.510
After two weeks they left

42:52.709 --> 43:04.983
And I get a letter from them that I underestimated with $7,000 my donation, and with $7,000 more than what I claimed.

43:05.003 --> 43:05.504
More?

43:06.605 --> 43:14.434
So you underestimated?

43:14.554 --> 43:15.656
Oh, yeah.

43:16.116 --> 43:20.421
I'm sure there'll be other questions.

43:20.941 --> 43:21.582
Still writing?

43:22.323 --> 43:22.663
Sure.

43:22.824 --> 43:27.971
I have a weekly column in the Chicago paper in Sagincom Park.

43:28.191 --> 43:36.022
I have a monthly column in the fastest growing food service industry publication.

43:36.042 --> 43:46.577
I have a regular column in the International Wine and Food Society London European publication and one in their American publications.

43:46.861 --> 43:55.153
And I write occasionally in other places.

43:55.173 --> 43:56.034
So you're keeping busy.

43:56.054 --> 43:57.717
You're not a retired retired man.

43:58.938 --> 44:00.120
Not really.

44:00.140 --> 44:00.901
You're doing different things.

44:00.921 --> 44:01.702
Not really.

44:02.023 --> 44:03.425
So you ran the restaurants.

44:03.445 --> 44:04.246
You were there every day.

44:04.266 --> 44:05.988
It wasn't the... Every day.

44:09.293 --> 44:11.316
Except...

44:11.296 --> 44:16.186
when I was traveling, otherwise I was there.

44:17.909 --> 44:28.070
We had a very good arrangement because when I went someplace with my wife, she was there with the rest of the family.

44:28.631 --> 44:32.258
If my wife took Barbie to China to a cooking school,

44:32.238 --> 44:38.807
Then I was there and the rest of the family, and when they went to Hanyevi, my wife and Barbara.

44:39.768 --> 44:46.057
When I went with Barbara someplace, my wife was there and the rest of the family.

44:46.157 --> 44:48.460
Remember when I was coming?

44:48.480 --> 44:48.820
Yeah.

44:48.900 --> 44:53.166
Remember when I went to do a television show, I took care of it.

44:53.146 --> 44:57.892
Whenever I went to teach, I taught at Penn State for 11 years.

44:58.172 --> 45:08.224
Then I always took help because she was my built-in.

45:08.244 --> 45:10.627
Thank you very much.

45:11.328 --> 45:13.290
Thank you both very much.

45:13.310 --> 45:15.593
You're very well.

45:15.573 --> 45:25.446
I guess one other question.

45:25.466 --> 45:34.278
There must have been a point where the books were just pouring into the building, like a thousand.

45:34.298 --> 45:35.860
Did you ever say, what am I doing?

45:35.940 --> 45:39.825
Did you ever start to say, this is madness?

45:40.109 --> 45:42.132
What am I doing?

45:42.152 --> 45:44.375
Were you on a mission?

45:44.395 --> 45:45.837
You defined your focus, sir.

45:45.857 --> 45:49.141
You could have several focus, several areas of focus.

45:50.042 --> 45:52.886
You went collecting everything.

45:54.708 --> 46:05.863
Just secretly, I had a small apartment with an elegant little sign on a copper plate on the door.

46:06.451 --> 46:08.855
And the sign was in Hungarian.

46:10.037 --> 46:14.625
And it said in Hungarian, what the hell did I buy this for?

46:15.006 --> 46:16.989
What the hell did I buy this for?

46:18.312 --> 46:27.728
And that apartment was full of the things, but I was wondering, what the hell did I buy this for?

46:28.089 --> 46:29.391
Did you answer the question?

46:29.411 --> 46:31.615
Why did you buy this for?

46:31.595 --> 46:33.718
I enjoyed it.

46:33.818 --> 46:38.003
Venezuela.

46:38.484 --> 46:47.396
And we went out to the jungle, to the rainforest, to an Indian market.

46:47.776 --> 46:52.202
Once a month, the medicine man had

46:52.790 --> 46:53.932
a market.

46:54.813 --> 47:07.110
And there was a fabulous, long, giant, snake skin.

47:08.832 --> 47:10.775
And I bought it.

47:10.795 --> 47:12.458
And we took it home.

47:13.779 --> 47:19.908
And I walked in that particular room in my office where I used to dictate.

47:20.228 --> 47:22.071
I have a British secretary here.

47:22.051 --> 47:23.855
It works for me.

47:24.055 --> 47:25.779
I resist for 14 years.

47:26.200 --> 47:31.912
I have a British secretary since 14 years.

47:31.932 --> 47:40.009
As prevalent, English can be tall, red hair, skinny, flat chest.

47:39.989 --> 47:49.540
So I had this little room and I said to the guy, put that snake skin on the wall.

47:50.641 --> 47:58.430
And I was working in the kitchen and he came down and he said, should we cut out the rest?

47:58.530 --> 48:00.172
I said, what do you mean the rest?

48:00.292 --> 48:02.174
He said, that's too long for the wall.

48:02.254 --> 48:07.661
I said, okay, then run on the other wall, you idiot.

48:07.681 --> 48:09.743
He said, yeah, but it's longer than...

48:09.723 --> 48:11.686
Who was?

48:11.706 --> 48:14.229
I said, well, run as long as it works.

48:15.391 --> 48:24.783
So then the man who was in charge came down and said, Chef Louis, we have the snakeskin now on all four walls.

48:25.304 --> 48:27.667
Now what you want us to do with the rest?

48:27.687 --> 48:31.372
Should we cut off the rest?

48:31.392 --> 48:34.296
I said, roll it up and put it back in the plastic.

48:34.732 --> 48:40.002
Still in the same goddamn class.

48:40.904 --> 48:43.749
Why did you buy a snake's kit?

48:44.931 --> 48:49.219
Because I thought you'd be nice on the wall.

48:49.460 --> 48:56.132
I don't want to be enclosed in a snake's kit.

49:04.972 --> 49:06.114
What are we looking at now?

49:06.855 --> 49:07.475
All menus.

49:08.176 --> 49:08.997
These are all menus.

49:09.238 --> 49:10.059
Yes.

49:10.079 --> 49:13.343
All the boxes, too.

49:13.884 --> 49:15.646
Now, what was up to the bottom?

49:16.327 --> 49:21.334
All books and cookbooks.

49:21.374 --> 49:23.437
Tell me why menus are important.

49:25.059 --> 49:32.329
Menus are probably not as much, but more important than cookbooks.

49:32.910 --> 49:34.472
Why is that?

49:35.228 --> 49:41.433
If you buy a cookbook, you never know did anybody ever cooked that recipe.

49:41.454 --> 49:44.937
Was it popular at the time or not?

49:45.377 --> 49:50.221
But menu in a restaurant, you don't put anything on a menu that you don't serve.

49:57.167 --> 49:59.850
I wonder where there is another great collection of menus.

49:59.890 --> 50:00.911
There probably isn't any.

50:01.651 --> 50:04.594
Oh, at the University of Nevada.

50:04.743 --> 50:05.143
Really?

50:05.163 --> 50:09.908
Well, yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.010
Yeah, but you're the only one who gets it.

50:15.113 --> 50:15.794
Postcards.

50:19.278 --> 50:20.218
18,000.

50:20.239 --> 50:22.681
More than 18,000, okay.

50:22.701 --> 50:24.383
If I take a picture, I want you in it.

50:26.725 --> 50:29.127
I've got a collection of 6,000 postcards.

50:30.269 --> 50:30.849
Showing you out.

50:31.550 --> 50:32.391
I'll tell you in a second.

50:32.411 --> 50:33.952
Ever hear of Francis Henry Taylor?

50:34.633 --> 50:34.733
Yeah.

50:35.118 --> 50:38.562
He was the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

50:39.362 --> 50:42.346
He was also the director of the Worcester.

50:42.366 --> 50:46.710
And when he died, a friend of this guy bought his whole library.

50:48.132 --> 50:50.875
And he also, the man was a great collector of postcards.

50:50.935 --> 50:53.337
Every place he went all over the world, he bought postcards.

50:53.898 --> 50:54.779
And I'm at an auction.

50:56.881 --> 50:58.423
These are Harper's Weekly?

50:58.963 --> 51:03.488
These are all kinds of weeklies from Germany, from Austria.

51:04.058 --> 51:06.160
from France, from England.

51:06.180 --> 51:08.102
These are wonderful, by the way.

51:08.122 --> 51:09.083
These are outstanding.

51:12.587 --> 51:14.669
Well, these are basically wood engravings we're looking at.

51:14.709 --> 51:16.651
Wood engravings.

51:16.671 --> 51:17.652
Steel-like engravings.

51:18.893 --> 51:22.136
Photograph used from the later time.

51:23.558 --> 51:26.841
But this is a topical collection.

51:26.961 --> 51:30.265
Absolutely everything on food.

51:30.285 --> 51:31.686
And I could go on and on

51:32.003 --> 51:34.526
All of these boxes, because this is all this.

51:37.129 --> 51:38.932
So what do we say, Elendus?

51:38.972 --> 51:41.114
This room now is all your stuff.

51:41.135 --> 51:41.395
Yes.

51:42.036 --> 51:43.958
And how long has this been here, this material?

51:45.440 --> 51:49.065
Oh, just about less than a year.

51:49.085 --> 51:49.805
Less than a year.

51:51.147 --> 51:52.889
In this room, or this is your office?

51:53.330 --> 51:53.610
Cool.

51:54.672 --> 51:54.972
Nice.

51:58.797 --> 52:00.559
I collected everything with you.

52:00.843 --> 52:02.765
Your hand and your mouth.

52:02.785 --> 52:04.567
Everything between your hand and your mouth.

52:07.230 --> 52:10.113
You know this guy's signature?

52:10.533 --> 52:10.753
No.

52:10.833 --> 52:11.975
I don't have my glasses on.

52:11.995 --> 52:12.635
I can't see it.

52:12.655 --> 52:13.436
Bonaparte.

52:14.397 --> 52:14.477
Ah.

52:16.780 --> 52:17.300
Yeah.

52:17.380 --> 52:20.644
We've got a Bonaparte room over at the Carter Brown Library.

52:20.764 --> 52:22.265
Oh, that's Carter Brown, the John Hay.

52:23.206 --> 52:23.927
Is this your desk?

52:24.568 --> 52:25.108
Yes, sir.

52:25.128 --> 52:26.229
Would you sit in it for me?

52:27.270 --> 52:29.673
That's what I want to do.

52:29.693 --> 52:29.753
Oh.

52:32.686 --> 52:33.547
Oh, I like this.

52:33.847 --> 52:36.590
Is Sierra replicating his office?

52:37.852 --> 52:43.278
Oh, I haven't been to the back part.

52:43.799 --> 52:44.219
There's more.

52:44.660 --> 52:46.342
Oh, twice as much.

52:46.362 --> 52:47.483
How do you like this place?

52:48.584 --> 52:49.625
I don't like the smell.

52:51.207 --> 52:52.288
I can't smell anything.

52:52.869 --> 52:53.490
What is this?

52:53.510 --> 52:55.712
The cookery?

52:55.732 --> 52:56.834
I don't have my glasses on.

52:56.854 --> 52:59.236
Elizabeth Robbins Pinnell, my cookery books.

52:59.256 --> 53:00.998
And how do you spell her last name?

53:01.859 --> 53:02.440
P-E-N-N.

53:02.673 --> 53:04.495
E-L-L.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.817
The book was designed by 1903.

53:06.837 --> 53:07.538
It's beautiful.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.322
It was a warbling way.

53:11.342 --> 53:17.929
The book was designed by the number one American book designer of the time.

53:18.309 --> 53:19.951
It's beautiful.

53:19.971 --> 53:21.913
God, that's wonderful.

53:21.933 --> 53:24.616
I think her husband was an expert on art.

53:24.636 --> 53:26.798
I think it's like volume after volume.

53:26.938 --> 53:27.979
That's 1903?

53:28.500 --> 53:30.282
Bruce Rogers did the book.

53:31.383 --> 53:31.583
Thank you.

53:32.153 --> 53:40.165
That's very, very important.

53:40.185 --> 53:43.150
And she talked about her collecting there?

53:44.311 --> 53:45.734
But did she talk about her collecting?

53:46.335 --> 54:01.097
330 copies printed out the Riverside Press Cambridge in the month of September 1903, of which this is number 243.

54:01.499 --> 54:02.600
I'm going to look for that.

54:02.620 --> 54:03.922
Is that a tough book to find, you think?

54:03.942 --> 54:04.783
Yes.

54:05.004 --> 54:05.985
Yeah, the prices are going.

54:06.025 --> 54:06.385
That's all right.

54:06.505 --> 54:08.128
I mean, I know that.

54:08.148 --> 54:15.117
I mean, I just paid, you can't believe what I paid just to get a copy of Lessing Rosenwald's book, Recollections of a Collector.

54:15.277 --> 54:16.478
It's only 14 years old.

54:16.498 --> 54:18.321
I paid $285 for us.

54:19.142 --> 54:20.864
It's a wonderful book.

54:22.466 --> 54:23.628
You've had that book?

54:23.648 --> 54:24.609
Lessing Rosenwald's book?

54:24.629 --> 54:25.790
Yeah, her plates are put in.

54:25.810 --> 54:27.132
Oh, Riverside.

54:27.352 --> 54:28.474
Boy, Riverside pressed it.

54:28.534 --> 54:31.017
It's a wonderful book.

54:32.110 --> 54:39.597
Yes, this is the ledger you were talking about.

54:39.657 --> 54:40.898
...facsimile.

54:41.559 --> 54:42.260
Uh-huh.

54:42.380 --> 54:44.482
Okay.

54:45.503 --> 54:53.730
I'm looking, yeah.

54:54.471 --> 54:56.733
George Washington.

54:56.934 --> 54:57.214
Mm-hmm.

54:57.234 --> 55:00.897
Now, this is not a facsimile.

55:00.917 --> 55:01.678
This is actually

55:02.671 --> 55:26.167
Accounts of George Washington with the United States commencing June 1775, running June 1783, comprehending a space of eight years.

55:26.187 --> 55:28.290
Treasury Department and Registrar's Office

55:28.810 --> 55:30.272
1st June 1833.

55:30.612 --> 55:37.961
General Washington's account of expenses during a Revolutionary War, and his own handwriting is on file in this office.

55:37.981 --> 55:40.304
Here next is a facsimile copy of it.

55:41.225 --> 55:45.590
Okay.

55:45.610 --> 55:45.811
That's it.

55:45.831 --> 55:48.174
Now, why would they have made a facsimile of that?

55:48.194 --> 55:48.814
Oh, the treasure.

55:49.675 --> 55:52.399
And you said there are only a handful of copies of these, right?

55:52.859 --> 55:53.440
Yes.

55:53.460 --> 55:54.481
Four, something like that?

55:54.561 --> 55:55.522
Oh, no, no, no, no.

55:56.163 --> 55:58.446
The order, the thousand, but we destroyed it.

55:59.185 --> 56:00.687
Why did they, why did they destroy it?

56:01.187 --> 56:14.023
Because he found out that whatever he could not account for, he said, uh, intelligence and espionage.

56:14.043 --> 56:15.145
Negative.

56:15.165 --> 56:24.156
So that's... Now, this is the world's first book on salads.

56:24.176 --> 56:26.198
The world's first book on salads.

56:26.739 --> 56:27.760
Oh, you have a book plate.

56:28.101 --> 56:29.142
Oh, I have several books.

56:29.780 --> 56:33.846
That's my colleague.

56:34.086 --> 56:36.710
Okay, this is already University of Iowa.

56:36.910 --> 56:38.653
Yeah, that's what we mentioned.

56:38.673 --> 56:40.636
Oh, this is the book that came overnight.

56:40.696 --> 56:43.200
We did a filming for Proctor and Gamble.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.344
They made a series, one on crosses and one on salads.

56:46.985 --> 56:50.270
And so they used this in one of the props that would be shown all over the world.

56:50.530 --> 56:52.473
That's magnificent.

56:52.493 --> 56:59.263
In Venice, and my Roman numerals are good, but it looks to me like it's 1627, right.

57:00.357 --> 57:03.562
And it's, I couldn't, I couldn't do it.

57:03.582 --> 57:04.483
Aciditno, whatever it is.

57:04.563 --> 57:05.544
Where does it say salads?

57:05.665 --> 57:06.225
Oh, sure.

57:06.326 --> 57:07.607
Del ensalata.

57:07.627 --> 57:15.278
Aciditno, ovvero, del ensalata, y del uso di essa.

57:15.879 --> 57:18.663
The usage of essig.

57:19.124 --> 57:21.127
Essig is vinegar.

57:21.227 --> 57:24.431
Now, are they salads as we know them?

57:24.452 --> 57:24.812
Yes.

57:25.872 --> 57:28.595
Why would they commit a whole book to sell?

57:28.755 --> 57:49.315
Really, these books is really... I gave you that book with the apes.

57:49.836 --> 57:51.217
Did you brought it in or still?

57:52.238 --> 57:54.040
They really haven't foxed it off.

57:57.344 --> 58:00.308
So, Biola already has the whole thing cattle on, too.

58:00.388 --> 58:00.989
Oh, yes.

58:01.810 --> 58:04.594
Not the whole thing, but the beginning.

58:04.614 --> 58:09.201
You know, like, for seven years, year after year after year.

58:11.364 --> 58:13.026
They must be very pleased with that.

58:14.408 --> 58:16.852
And the thing about it is, it came to them out of the woodwork.

58:16.872 --> 58:19.476
They had no idea that it was coming.

58:19.576 --> 58:21.439
It was like mana from the sky.

58:22.981 --> 58:24.583
I think it's very nice.

58:25.475 --> 58:27.077
He seems like a pretty good guy.

58:27.117 --> 58:29.201
David, a wonderful man.

58:29.321 --> 58:30.302
Good to work with him.

58:31.884 --> 58:32.586
He's very proud.

58:32.606 --> 58:34.108
He's the one who told me to get in touch with you.

58:35.530 --> 58:37.553
You know, he said, you've got to do this.

58:37.573 --> 58:38.775
He told me I've got to do you.

58:38.795 --> 58:40.437
Did you talk to David?

58:40.457 --> 58:40.998
Yeah.

58:41.038 --> 58:45.224
David's the one who... David, we love David.

58:45.605 --> 58:53.536
David sent me... Oh, this is... Oh, look at the leather on it, huh?

58:54.558 --> 58:55.279
That's...

58:56.913 --> 58:59.415
Tell me what this is.

58:59.435 --> 58:59.956
What is it?

58:59.976 --> 59:03.919
That's a book against drinking, against alcohol.

59:03.939 --> 59:05.821
Oh, this is a book against the consumption.

59:05.841 --> 59:07.743
This is a temperance tract.

59:07.983 --> 59:08.384
Yes.

59:09.825 --> 59:11.086
Look this bit.

59:11.106 --> 59:14.369
This is really nothing like it.

59:14.389 --> 59:15.010
I can't believe.

59:15.070 --> 59:15.951
You see, condition.

59:15.991 --> 59:17.832
You always insisted on conditioning.

59:17.972 --> 59:18.653
No, no.

59:18.673 --> 59:26.160
Sometimes I've had books which have been hard to, and I know that I couldn't get a better one or until I get a better one.

59:26.495 --> 59:27.897
Why is it all in Latin?

59:27.997 --> 59:32.624
I thought you said it's local.

59:33.184 --> 59:34.747
Oh, local meaning Johnson and Wales.

59:34.867 --> 59:35.227
Yeah.

59:36.169 --> 59:36.709
I didn't get it.

59:36.729 --> 59:37.130
I'm sorry.

59:39.353 --> 59:46.904
That's from the collection of Andre Simone, who was the founder of the International Wine and Food Society.

59:51.009 --> 59:52.792
Is that your code or the bookseller's code?

59:52.992 --> 59:53.633
The bookseller.

59:56.836 --> 01:00:01.161
Do you erase what you paid out of them?

01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:03.183
I'll leave mine in, because I like to know.

01:00:03.263 --> 01:00:04.505
Certain times, no.

01:00:04.705 --> 01:00:10.652
Certain times, yes.

01:00:10.672 --> 01:00:11.232
It's magnificent.

01:00:11.252 --> 01:00:13.114
How old is this?

01:00:13.315 --> 01:00:20.943
Oh, this is, um, fifteen to hundred and sixteen.

01:00:21.264 --> 01:00:24.227
Oh, my brother.

01:00:25.135 --> 01:00:26.336
This is 1,540.

01:00:26.516 --> 01:00:31.941
Oh, yeah, 1,540.

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:39.248
So it's 460, 450 years old.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:40.269
1,540.

01:00:42.251 --> 01:00:44.193
That's all right.

01:00:44.213 --> 01:00:46.955
Is the binding, I don't know what the binding is.

01:00:47.035 --> 01:00:53.421
The binding is about mid-80s.
