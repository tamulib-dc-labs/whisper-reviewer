WEBVTT

00:04.807 --> 00:06.129
So it's interesting.

00:06.169 --> 00:13.619
You asked me to check my tape recorder, and you have lost a few important interviews.

00:13.739 --> 00:14.140
No.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.062
You see, I'm so inept.

00:16.643 --> 00:18.305
There's an irony here.

00:18.425 --> 00:21.049
The tape recorder is my right hand.

00:21.069 --> 00:33.666
You know, when I talk, of course, I'm able to get someone to transcribe it when I finish, and I said, get everything down with a tape recorder, even a pause or a cough, or a certain kind of laugh.

00:34.270 --> 00:40.158
For example, among African-American people, the laugh comes in strange moments sometimes.

00:40.178 --> 00:43.402
It's like when someone is recounting a moment of humiliation.

00:44.143 --> 00:52.774
As Big Bill Broomsey and old Broomsey G.R., O-N-Z-Y, recounted the moment he was a working man, blues singer.

00:53.354 --> 00:58.401
He was a molder, and he was teaching this young guy, a white guy, how to do the job and taught him.

00:58.901 --> 01:00.864
So when it came to firing people, he was fired.

01:00.944 --> 01:01.985
He had to get retained.

01:02.466 --> 01:04.108
As he tells that, he starts laughing.

01:04.477 --> 01:12.708
Or a moment, he and I were to bar together Winston and several other white guys, and they'd serve us, but not him.

01:13.289 --> 01:13.750
Really?

01:13.970 --> 01:14.751
We refused.

01:14.771 --> 01:22.101
Oh, yeah, Lafayette, Indiana, on our way to Purdue University for a concert, a folk song concert.

01:22.121 --> 01:25.666
And so, as we leave, he's starting to laugh.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.069
It's nowhere to safety valve.

01:28.730 --> 01:33.657
Laugh is a blues, a laugh on the key from crying, was one of the songs.

01:33.738 --> 01:36.723
The laughing on the outside, crying on the inside.

01:36.743 --> 01:41.311
Well, today you'd say with African Americans, laughing to keep from raging.

01:41.331 --> 01:52.050
But in any event, so to me, the tape recorder is important, and yet I have goofed up because I'm mechanically inept, let's face it.

01:52.469 --> 01:54.231
I cannot drive a car.

01:54.792 --> 01:55.152
Come on.

01:55.813 --> 01:56.955
No, it's true.

01:57.075 --> 01:57.796
Do you drive a car?

01:57.916 --> 01:58.196
Never.

01:58.477 --> 01:58.957
You don't?

01:59.158 --> 02:01.681
I don't have the biggest idea how to drive a car.

02:01.701 --> 02:02.422
How did you get around?

02:02.462 --> 02:02.842
Taxi cars?

02:02.902 --> 02:10.632
Well, I get around buses, you know, when my wife drives, but I haven't the slightest idea.

02:10.652 --> 02:17.681
And so here I am, the irony, I've lost, because I've pushed the wrong buttons, I've lost Martha Graham.

02:18.082 --> 02:22.307
Imagine, I've lost Michael Redgrave, the British director.

02:22.777 --> 02:31.210
I almost thought Jacques Tati, the French actor, and he got a kick out of that because he hates machines.

02:31.891 --> 02:34.936
And all his plays deal with man versus machine.

02:35.857 --> 02:38.621
And I almost blew the interview, and he said, this is great.

02:38.641 --> 02:41.005
He says, come to my hotel and we'll do it again.

02:41.305 --> 02:42.606
That was very nice.

02:43.247 --> 02:43.787
Yeah.

02:43.807 --> 02:46.950
But he says, it makes me feel good, because that's my point.

02:47.051 --> 02:49.793
Were you able to reconstruct any of these that you lost?

02:49.873 --> 02:53.337
No, they're lost, because the voice is lost, too.

02:54.177 --> 02:58.842
And the way she talked, remembered early choreography and dances.

02:58.862 --> 03:02.465
But so this is, so that's why I ask you to check.

03:02.525 --> 03:03.226
Check it all.

03:03.306 --> 03:10.333
I've done, over the last 20 years, I've done close to a thousand interviews myself.

03:10.921 --> 03:13.865
with authors, and I have quite an archive of tapes.

03:14.826 --> 03:18.651
Thank God, I've never lost a one, but I always check, and I have good equipment.

03:18.731 --> 03:26.421
I mean, it's like what they tell you, if you work in the mills or you're carpenter, I mean, you're only as good as your equipment, as your tools.

03:26.561 --> 03:27.142
That's right.

03:27.703 --> 03:31.848
So I always check it, make sure I have fresh batteries, and I used to go with a backup.

03:32.429 --> 03:38.076
Anyway, let's talk about, I mean, you certainly qualify

03:38.292 --> 03:42.176
You could have been one of your own subjects in this book, couldn't you?

03:42.196 --> 03:43.197
Well, I'm the big A3.

03:45.399 --> 03:50.143
I was born 1912, and that's the year the Titanic sank.

03:51.124 --> 03:54.928
So I call myself a Titanic baby.

03:54.948 --> 04:00.353
And I always say that went down, I came up, but then who said life was fair?

04:01.254 --> 04:07.540
But I'm like the Titanic in the way I've skirted some icebergs here and there in my life.

04:07.958 --> 04:15.105
I'm yet to hit the big iceberg or the tip of it that knocked off the Titanic.

04:15.125 --> 04:22.153
And so, in a way, I'm eligible, certainly, as far as the calendar goes, eligible for the book.

04:22.173 --> 04:30.321
And so, I suppose you'd say, the book itself, you know, deals with people of a certain age.

04:30.662 --> 04:35.767
Coming of age, the title, is also ironic to take off.

04:36.107 --> 04:36.868
Coming of age.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.312
mean anthropologically, you know.

04:40.814 --> 04:48.824
Margaret Mead, in her classic book, Coming of Age in Samoa, is the kid reaching the age of puberty, boys and girls.

04:48.844 --> 04:52.568
And I say this is the age of puberty of thought, 70 and over.

04:52.588 --> 04:55.532
70 is the minimum age.

04:56.113 --> 05:04.843
I chose that deliberately because that's the biblical, the scriptural three score and ten as man, the man, woman span.

05:05.624 --> 05:06.585
But because of

05:07.207 --> 05:10.592
medical discoveries and technological advances.

05:10.753 --> 05:13.637
We have lifespan increased considerably.

05:13.657 --> 05:20.509
If you multiply the 70 by their collective years, you're in the thousands, isn't it, in terms of years of experience?

05:20.529 --> 05:21.210
Oh, yeah.

05:21.370 --> 05:23.053
Like this book, for example.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.737
There are people here 99 years old.

05:26.599 --> 05:30.224
Her aunt was a slave, Carolyn Perry.

05:30.244 --> 05:34.311
She's now, since the book, she celebrated her 100th birthday.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.884
But you put them together, the 70 people or so, they're thousands of years.

05:39.745 --> 05:44.830
You want to mention that you've lost three of the people that you interviewed.

05:45.571 --> 05:46.652
Oh, you've died since.

05:46.672 --> 05:46.892
Yeah.

05:47.192 --> 05:48.133
Or more than that.

05:48.393 --> 05:48.774
Is that right?

05:49.194 --> 05:56.702
Since I wrote that, and since I was able to make the second edition, a couple more have died.

05:56.722 --> 05:57.382
This is funny.

05:57.603 --> 06:01.687
We're talking about equipment going down, and I can't get away.

06:02.007 --> 06:02.948
It's never happened.

06:03.198 --> 06:07.522
It looks like the Battle of Machines versus Man.

06:07.542 --> 06:11.646
I was cursed by my own... I'm sorry, just keep talking.

06:11.666 --> 06:17.872
So basically we're talking about, as you're fixing the camera, you're talking about the nature of the book.

06:19.894 --> 06:22.437
The reason this book is done, there's a subtitle.

06:23.578 --> 06:25.860
Coming of Age is the title.

06:25.880 --> 06:32.226
The subtitle is Our Century as Told by Those Who Lived It.

06:33.067 --> 06:42.014
We're five years away from the end of the century, five years from the end of the millennium, like 2000s, the new millennium, no.

06:42.815 --> 06:43.856
Have we progressed?

06:43.876 --> 06:44.877
To what extent?

06:44.897 --> 06:46.999
Where have we retrogressed?

06:48.060 --> 06:50.542
We've transgressed, God knows.

06:50.562 --> 06:52.243
And so here we are.

06:52.283 --> 07:01.771
These people have lived most of the century, and that's why I've called upon them as our unofficial historians, you might say.

07:01.971 --> 07:02.972
They're much like...

07:03.492 --> 07:14.332
I think of them as Alex Haley, when working on Roots, returned to the land, or went to the land of his ancestors in West Africa, Gambia.

07:14.913 --> 07:23.329
And there he met the Griots, T-R-I-O-T, who were storytellers, and in a way, from one generation to another.

07:23.730 --> 07:26.395
So these people in my book are sort of my Griots.

07:27.134 --> 07:31.581
I did an interview once with Alden Whitman, who used to write obituaries for the New York Times.

07:31.601 --> 07:32.662
Oh, I remember him, yes.

07:32.682 --> 07:34.946
And he used to interview his subjects.

07:36.348 --> 07:37.390
It was quite unusual.

07:37.470 --> 07:40.374
He would go and interview them in anticipation of their death.

07:40.394 --> 07:45.903
Well, I remember I never... One regret is just precisely that.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.886
I knew him.

07:48.106 --> 07:50.970
He was a friend, and he got a lot of stuff out of me.

07:51.491 --> 07:55.437
But then one day, he said, let you and I have lunch, meaning of course...

07:55.687 --> 07:57.409
I said, don't rush me.

07:57.449 --> 07:58.331
Don't rush me.

07:58.371 --> 07:59.672
But you know what I'm talking about.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.795
I never had lunch, and that's my regret.

08:01.815 --> 08:09.526
But he said he used to go and he'd sit down, and it could be Harry Truman or whomever, and they'd say, well, what's the purpose of this?

08:09.586 --> 08:11.508
And they'd say, well, it's for the future.

08:11.809 --> 08:13.271
He said, oh, you mean when I die?

08:13.591 --> 08:14.192
Oh!

08:14.532 --> 08:19.099
In that instance, they really would want to talk to get the record straight.

08:19.259 --> 08:23.905
And also he said, for some reason, and this is pertinent to what you've done, he said,

08:24.222 --> 08:28.808
When people hit the age of 70, he said they begin, they learn how to count.

08:29.690 --> 08:33.535
They're able to clock, they're alert, aware of.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.319
Do you find this same kind of a thing?

08:36.339 --> 08:49.637
I find an awareness on the part of people in the book of mortality, that it's approaching mortality naturally, with their aches and their pains at the same time.

08:50.539 --> 08:51.580
In this book, the

08:52.201 --> 08:58.046
underlying theme or the recurring theme is they don't grieve for themselves.

08:58.907 --> 09:01.790
People I've interviewed, people whose lives have been pretty full.

09:02.530 --> 09:07.014
It's not the golf cart set, not that I'm opposed to golf or anything.

09:07.034 --> 09:20.807
It's simply people who have been involved in the world outside themselves in some sense of community, whether it be labor people or people in the neighborhood fighting waste dumps, whoever it might be, peace groups,

09:21.209 --> 09:22.971
but people outside themselves.

09:23.051 --> 09:26.956
And so their lives are pretty full, but they grieve for the young.

09:27.938 --> 09:36.548
And the young today, they feel have no sense of past, and no fault of their own, and no wonder about the future.

09:36.568 --> 09:37.790
Many bewildered young.

09:38.451 --> 09:41.274
Many of them say, I'm not going to be as well off as my old man.

09:41.795 --> 09:48.343
And that's quite a reversal of the American dream, which my kid will have better than me.

09:48.363 --> 09:49.345
So that's part of it.

09:49.365 --> 09:50.406
Did you have a...

09:51.837 --> 09:53.559
Tell me about the selection process.

09:53.579 --> 09:59.204
Now, you say in your acknowledgments how you apologize to so many people who didn't make the cut.

09:59.264 --> 10:02.588
Well, you see, I got to get that straight first.

10:02.788 --> 10:05.871
I interviewed more people in Matthew that are in the book.

10:05.891 --> 10:11.597
The people I did not put in the book are just as good as real in the book.

10:11.657 --> 10:12.858
And this is the hard part.

10:13.258 --> 10:15.180
This is the bad part.

10:15.861 --> 10:17.963
Who do I leave out and why?

10:18.787 --> 10:21.329
Well, it's like the director of a play, I suppose.

10:21.369 --> 10:24.712
There are two actors equally as good.

10:24.732 --> 10:25.593
Whom do you choose?

10:26.054 --> 10:33.681
One is not better than the other, but maybe balancing it against the rest of the cast is what in sports they call a judgment call.

10:33.701 --> 10:33.881
Sure.

10:34.602 --> 10:35.262
And that's hard.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.464
That was the tough part.

10:37.484 --> 10:41.168
When you, these people, you also think some scouts.

10:41.188 --> 10:44.991
You call them scouts, people who... Oh, well, I always call them scouts.

10:45.392 --> 10:46.112
That's how I work.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.034
Somebody tells me about someone...

10:48.098 --> 10:58.467
I can hear about this person, and I, when I was doing the book on working, for example, working deals with different occupations, different jobs people do.

10:59.087 --> 11:02.210
I wanted to say, I know a washroom attendant, says this guy.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.192
This guy, you ought to get this washroom.

11:04.212 --> 11:05.373
Sure, I did use a washroom.

11:05.393 --> 11:17.683
He tells me what it's like to be there, or a parking lot, or a teacher, or a small businessman, but a certain kind of person, they say, who's able to articulate, ordinary person, but as they see,

11:18.288 --> 11:28.178
These ordinary people, not big shots, are able to say what's in the thoughts of the others, but they can't say.

11:28.198 --> 11:29.119
Others can't say.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.101
It's inchoate in the others.

11:31.961 --> 11:37.807
And so someone says, I've talked to this woman on the block about something, a housewife about something.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.070
She says, why don't you go see Florence at the end of the block?

11:41.150 --> 11:41.811
Oh, Florence.

11:42.352 --> 11:43.553
Well, Florence is the one.

11:43.593 --> 11:45.935
See Florence.

11:46.315 --> 11:47.957
She talks a certain way.

11:48.848 --> 11:51.932
Florence, but she is in the same strata of society.

11:53.074 --> 11:56.319
Blue-collar housewife might be.

11:56.339 --> 12:01.126
But Florence had that added insight or something.

12:01.146 --> 12:03.469
Says what this woman wants to say, but can't.

12:03.830 --> 12:05.512
But a woman knows Florence can say it.

12:05.873 --> 12:08.517
So it's the Florenses of the world I look for.

12:08.637 --> 12:12.162
Now, there was a very good friend of mine who recently died.

12:12.623 --> 12:14.265
He was in his late 70s.

12:14.971 --> 12:16.873
He was alone.

12:17.313 --> 12:18.975
He was a lifelong bachelor.

12:18.995 --> 12:21.617
He was a book reviewer of mine.

12:21.757 --> 12:22.578
Pardon me, I must say.

12:22.598 --> 12:23.118
That's all right.

12:23.138 --> 12:31.286
And I remember he was saying, he said, the years go by so quickly, it's the days that go by so quickly.

12:31.306 --> 12:33.588
Which, that reminds me.

12:33.608 --> 12:42.716
When somebody's doing a job of work, let's say it's a spot welder, an auto plant, that's work, and it's drudgery, the same, do the same thing.

12:42.736 --> 12:44.117
You've got this 20-pound

12:44.502 --> 12:49.487
welding guns, shooting welds, into this revolving snake, the assembly line.

12:50.248 --> 12:59.238
So he's yearning for the time that he can retire, 30 and out, and I don't want to work as one there, 30 years, and he's got a pension and live on.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.541
He's there, where's a teacher?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.183
The old guy might love his work.

13:03.203 --> 13:04.724
He doesn't want to be forced to retire.

13:05.165 --> 13:10.591
But the days go by slowly, and it's a funny story, but it's a true one, and it retells everything.

13:11.372 --> 13:12.493
He's a meter reader.

13:12.553 --> 13:13.674
I call him Conrad.

13:14.035 --> 13:14.475
It's the word.

13:14.776 --> 13:16.739
You know what a gas meter reader is?

13:17.100 --> 13:19.844
He's got the flashlight put down in the basement, looks at the meter.

13:20.465 --> 13:23.509
He says, you know, this is the days go by slowly.

13:24.130 --> 13:24.951
But you know what?

13:25.672 --> 13:29.318
He says, there are two things on my mind in my life.

13:29.478 --> 13:32.723
Dogs and women.

13:33.324 --> 13:37.430
So I say to myself, the first is reality, the second is fantasy.

13:38.011 --> 13:41.256
And so he tells about the dogs and the trouble he has with dogs.

13:41.523 --> 13:44.566
You know, they're nipping at him and they're smacking him.

13:44.847 --> 13:47.450
And he's got that flashlight as a weapon to hold him for.

13:47.510 --> 13:50.253
And sometimes the dog bit him.

13:51.034 --> 13:53.276
The lady of the house balls him out.

13:53.797 --> 13:59.583
Even though he's bitten by the dog, the next woman is going down the stairs to the basement leading him down there.

14:00.004 --> 14:02.687
A little poodle goes in front of me and just smacks it.

14:02.707 --> 14:05.610
I smack it to make up for the one I missed over there.

14:06.151 --> 14:07.832
I said, that's enough about dogs.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.334
I said, but you were talking about women.

14:09.394 --> 14:10.095
What do you mean?

14:10.514 --> 14:14.998
Well, look, it hasn't happened to me yet, but it's possible.

14:15.218 --> 14:15.459
What?

14:15.959 --> 14:27.530
Well, you know, like in the summertime, in the suburbs, you got that young housewife, pretty old, she's pretty, she's lying on a blanket getting the sun outside in the backyard.

14:27.570 --> 14:28.591
How old is this guy?

14:28.851 --> 14:29.151
Yeah.

14:29.371 --> 14:30.973
How old is this guy?

14:30.993 --> 14:31.613
Around the 40s or so.

14:31.633 --> 14:32.895
Oh, he's a young man.

14:33.015 --> 14:35.537
But he's a guest reader, you see.

14:36.338 --> 14:39.981
And he says, and so I see you're lying out on the blanket,

14:40.147 --> 14:43.772
getting some sun on her back in a bikini, you know.

14:44.372 --> 14:49.960
Now, of course, she's loosened her bra, as they do, getting the sun, you know, and she's on a blanket.

14:50.841 --> 14:57.769
And so I creep up very slowly, very close, I holler, yes, man, and she turns around.

14:57.789 --> 15:05.960
And then he pauses, you know, I get balled out an awful lot, but it makes the day go faster.

15:05.980 --> 15:09.304
And that's anything to make the day go faster.

15:09.324 --> 15:09.985
That's right.

15:10.977 --> 15:18.526
Is this a companion book, in your view, to the working book of 20 years ago?

15:18.566 --> 15:20.068
Well, that's an interesting question.

15:20.148 --> 15:22.191
It's not so much a companion book as it is.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.495
It's almost a fusion of a number of books.

15:26.336 --> 15:29.920
It's about what changes happen in jobs.

15:30.561 --> 15:36.428
You know, the carpenter tells the prefab how the electrical saws on the computer and the effect it's had on

15:36.661 --> 15:38.684
people working north, all that.

15:38.704 --> 15:45.693
At the same time, it's also part of hard times, because people are remembering a certain moment in their life, the depression.

15:46.194 --> 15:50.880
It's part of the Good War, earlier book about World War II, and it's part of working.

15:51.321 --> 16:01.355
So in a way, it's the fusion of the previous books, reflections by someone who's lived through the periods of the previous books.

16:02.576 --> 16:05.200
So it's almost a natural follow-up

16:05.483 --> 16:09.728
with the fact that age and ageism is among us.

16:10.349 --> 16:10.670
It is.

16:11.110 --> 16:13.553
It's so appropriate, isn't it?

16:13.733 --> 16:21.423
Here we are in 1995, approaching the end of the second millennium, in the century for that matter.

16:21.443 --> 16:26.710
I mean, is there any kind of particular wisdom, in your view, to be gleaned from time?

16:26.730 --> 16:26.890
Oh, boy.

16:26.910 --> 16:27.290
I don't know.

16:27.310 --> 16:28.372
Well, that's just the point.

16:30.254 --> 16:32.297
What is it we've learned?

16:32.377 --> 16:33.398
There have been advances.

16:33.985 --> 16:37.811
There have been advances technologically, more than advances, leaps.

16:39.193 --> 16:42.237
But the wars, think about that.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.546
The evil empire is dead, so-called.

16:48.567 --> 17:01.846
But the wars go on, and nationalism, and one reason or another, old tribalism, and people, the big boys, at the same time, pushing smaller boys into battles.

17:02.828 --> 17:03.148
And...

17:03.736 --> 17:08.824
There's some little truth as far as race is concerned, deep, deep, deep.

17:08.844 --> 17:10.947
At the same time, bits here and there.

17:11.628 --> 17:13.350
You always hope gains have been made.

17:13.751 --> 17:15.133
You look upon these old.

17:15.674 --> 17:17.176
Some are hopeful, some are not.

17:17.276 --> 17:22.865
But basically, I think what's in me, guys, is also in many of them.

17:23.886 --> 17:29.234
There is less, at least for me, I always looked at the Sunnies, less optimism than there was.

17:29.595 --> 17:30.716
But at the same time, hope.

17:31.457 --> 17:33.220
It's hard to explain.

17:33.352 --> 17:39.138
I'm not optimistic, but hopeful, because hope.

17:39.158 --> 17:45.264
There's a woman named Jessie de la Cruz, and Jessie is Hispanic, Mexican-American.

17:45.744 --> 17:49.628
Jessie was a farm worker, worked with Cesar Chavez.

17:50.128 --> 17:57.415
She says, we have a saying in Mexico, a Spanish saying, and I'll translate this very badly.

17:58.136 --> 17:59.938
Esperanza, hope.

18:01.379 --> 18:02.160
Muera.

18:02.444 --> 18:06.391
dies el ultimo last.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.757
Hope dies last.

18:09.777 --> 18:13.123
Without hope, you're head in the oven.

18:14.065 --> 18:14.906
Without hope.

18:14.926 --> 18:16.129
So there's got to be hope.

18:16.589 --> 18:19.374
You know, what pleases me a great deal is that you don't sugarcoat this.

18:19.394 --> 18:23.642
You don't pretend that...

18:24.044 --> 18:24.745
It's easy.

18:24.765 --> 18:25.766
It's wonderful.

18:25.947 --> 18:27.389
Being old is getting old.

18:27.409 --> 18:28.770
Oh, my God, old.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.112
That's very important, isn't it?

18:30.132 --> 18:37.582
Sophia Mumford, the widow of the great Lewis Mumford, whoever said, going old is nice and sweet and golden.

18:38.063 --> 18:41.708
It's awful, and it's rotten, and there are illnesses that set you.

18:42.249 --> 18:50.440
And her late husband, of course, the great critic, lived to the 90s, and his old age, here he was, this humanistic,

18:52.107 --> 18:55.470
highly cultured, enlightened, and generous-hearted man.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.612
You see him there in the 90s now.

18:58.032 --> 18:59.053
He's incontinent.

18:59.254 --> 19:05.039
He's tough.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.402
Not meanster, but his temper is bad.

19:08.482 --> 19:12.266
He's jumping around doing whatever he dreamed of doing.

19:12.286 --> 19:15.549
And so getting old is not that great.

19:15.929 --> 19:16.630
It's just no bargain.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.212
At the same time, people try to be

19:19.782 --> 19:27.689
Old Gracie, just as I'm talking to you right now, Nick, you said people have died since the book.

19:27.709 --> 19:33.435
As a matter of fact, Helen Neering, 92, the widow of Scott Neering, a very great man of the past.

19:33.895 --> 19:41.942
She and her husband, he once upon a time was blacklisted because he was very anti-establishment, lost jobs.

19:42.243 --> 19:48.068
But later years, he and his wife, Helen, he died at 100, decided to die at 100.

19:48.807 --> 19:56.494
But he and his wife, Helen, became the gurus of the health food movement and many young fans, thousands.

19:57.314 --> 20:00.017
And so they wrote books on living well, eating well.

20:00.617 --> 20:04.661
And so I saw her, talked to her, and she's in great form.

20:04.721 --> 20:09.345
And when she goes, she hopes it's soon, you know, maybe crack her head and go.

20:09.785 --> 20:11.107
Not soon, she hopes it's sudden.

20:11.307 --> 20:12.868
Guess what?

20:12.888 --> 20:18.493
About three days before the conversation with you, I think of an item.

20:18.946 --> 20:24.311
Helen Earing killed her car, which she was driving, crashes into a tree.

20:24.852 --> 20:27.194
And so there, the way she wanted it.

20:27.474 --> 20:31.137
Can you really tell when people lose their will to live?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.079
Well, of course, these people haven't.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.161
The ones in the book haven't lost will to live.

20:35.221 --> 20:38.424
They've lost a lot of the hope in the world.

20:38.544 --> 20:41.547
Curiosity is maintained for a while.

20:42.088 --> 20:46.692
Oh, some says, one guy says, Pink Ferry, he's a guy who

20:47.279 --> 20:50.123
was a public relations guy, and he's up on everything.

20:50.143 --> 20:54.589
He's a sidekick, a rubber band, and Hutchins, the Ford Foundation.

20:54.649 --> 20:59.115
Ping says, he's not wild about living in the year 2000.

20:59.135 --> 21:01.958
The way things are going, he just assumed not that the year 2000.

21:02.619 --> 21:07.005
Do you find, I noticed that a lot of your subjects are hopeful.

21:07.025 --> 21:07.446
Oh, yeah.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.248
Well, they're mixed.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.269
It's a mixed thing.

21:10.630 --> 21:13.193
It's what I call guarded hopefulness.

21:13.233 --> 21:14.595
Guarded is the key word.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.898
Yes, no, yes, no.

21:17.435 --> 21:28.352
But hopeful in that, hopeful of seeing some change before we hit that year 2000, some change.

21:28.552 --> 21:30.695
In your introduction, you bemoaned.

21:31.376 --> 21:40.630
Of course, I'm an old newspaper man, and when I first went to work, I remember the old linotype machines clacking away and the sounds of the city room.

21:40.670 --> 21:41.792
You described it in the way.

21:41.812 --> 21:43.074
Well, Hank Ettinger.

21:43.174 --> 21:45.838
Hank Ettinger was a linotype operator.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.798
He worked for all kinds of newspapers and magazines.

21:49.919 --> 21:53.262
He started out as a kid, a printer's devil, a set type.

21:54.003 --> 21:59.748
And he saw the trade, the profession, change with technological advances.

22:00.629 --> 22:04.813
And he says, in the old, the composing room was like the city desk.

22:04.833 --> 22:06.195
The city desk was like the front page.

22:06.375 --> 22:10.039
There was noise and hollering back and forth, but there was a life.

22:10.439 --> 22:12.921
Now you go to the composing room, there's silence.

22:13.302 --> 22:14.543
But the city desk!

22:15.181 --> 22:18.167
Well, you think you're going to have reporters talking and calling out?

22:19.009 --> 22:28.109
They're all looking young reporters, male, female, staring into the windows of a computer terminal, it's called.

22:28.189 --> 22:32.358
You're talking to a guy that's wholly illiterate when it comes to the computer language.

22:32.839 --> 22:34.843
And so staring, and it's silent.

22:35.212 --> 22:36.033
It's eerie.

22:36.133 --> 22:36.974
It's not only that.

22:37.034 --> 22:39.858
When I first broke in, there were people, there were so many reporters.

22:39.878 --> 22:46.467
There was a city hall reporter, there was a police reporter, there was a court reporter, there was an arts reporter, education reporter, business.

22:47.048 --> 22:47.929
They're all gone.

22:48.009 --> 22:53.616
These papers have been bought up by conglomers that have let go people by 60%.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.420
And when I started work in Worcester, there were 940.

22:58.443 --> 23:01.307
Now you're hitting, now you're hitting a big one.

23:01.327 --> 23:02.768
It's papers, it's everything.

23:02.829 --> 23:03.970
It's publishing houses.

23:04.422 --> 23:05.383
It's everything.

23:05.944 --> 23:07.786
It's the conglomerates.

23:07.806 --> 23:14.875
You find that fewer and fewer people control more and more stuff, information as well as the material.

23:15.716 --> 23:18.099
And so that's the part.

23:18.119 --> 23:20.282
You find it very, you know that.

23:20.482 --> 23:26.810
Now it's one, there was one guy, he's an old-time public relations guy.

23:26.950 --> 23:32.877
Even, see what's happened is the touch of impersonality has entered the picture.

23:33.076 --> 23:34.677
We'll come to the computer in a minute.

23:36.479 --> 23:41.363
The touch of the human touch seems to be disappearing to great extent.

23:41.844 --> 23:43.345
And this guy was oppressing.

23:43.565 --> 23:44.146
He still is.

23:44.606 --> 23:48.349
He has a Lyric Africa of Chicago, and he's very funny.

23:48.369 --> 23:50.531
He's an old-time person, flamboyant.

23:50.912 --> 23:56.196
He used all the wild adjectives that describe the production of Carmen.

23:56.216 --> 24:02.982
He's that tempestuous, chipped-team maiden, you know, and he's an old-timer on his own.

24:03.164 --> 24:10.973
And so he says, in the old days, I'd write my own captions when I brought a prima donna to the town or a famous striptease artist.

24:11.314 --> 24:18.122
And he'd go to the city desk, he'd sit down, he'd take his jacket off, roll up with the type of caption.

24:18.362 --> 24:22.086
Today, if I did that, seven security guys would come and throw me out.

24:22.146 --> 24:23.067
That's exactly right.

24:23.168 --> 24:25.430
And he said, I couldn't even work at a computer anyway.

24:25.891 --> 24:28.474
So we see the personal touch.

24:28.954 --> 24:30.336
And that's where we come now.

24:30.788 --> 24:31.609
the computer.

24:31.729 --> 24:32.510
Does it do good?

24:32.550 --> 24:33.271
Well, of course.

24:33.752 --> 24:34.713
Does it help?

24:34.733 --> 24:39.479
Well, an investment banker talks about spreadsheets used to sweat to do, but now it's easy.

24:39.899 --> 24:58.922
An old lawyer says that what's easier it is, but the old painter, Jacob Lawrence, the African-American painter, says his students just retired from the University of Washington in Seattle, and he says his students on the computer frightened him a little because, and depressed him a bit, because

24:59.257 --> 25:06.988
I was in his studio, and there he showed, look at this chisel and the hammer I got, and he had this paintbrush.

25:07.028 --> 25:09.792
Will you smell the paint in the room?

25:09.812 --> 25:11.234
Touch the hairs of that brush.

25:11.595 --> 25:17.744
He's always this part of my painting, my breathing, all part of my painting.

25:18.445 --> 25:22.150
But some of the kids says, oh, you know, I can do a painting in half an hour.

25:22.931 --> 25:28.960
And they brag, I mean, on the computer, and of course they brag, my hand didn't

25:29.311 --> 25:30.633
even touch it.

25:30.954 --> 25:32.116
Imagine that.

25:32.136 --> 25:34.900
And that's what, see, same thing with the doctor.

25:34.940 --> 25:41.952
The old doctor in the book says, oh, he says, no question this computer has helped develop and many things.

25:41.972 --> 25:46.539
But I asked the young intern about our patient.

25:46.559 --> 25:48.002
How'd she do last night?

25:48.022 --> 25:49.705
He's all just a, well, Mr. Smith, you mean?

25:49.745 --> 25:51.067
Yeah, well, just a minute.

25:51.628 --> 25:56.095
He goes to his computer, punches out the latest lab test report.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.504
And out comes the report, and he says, oh, looks good, looks good.

26:00.985 --> 26:03.248
Wait a minute, says the old-time doctor.

26:03.268 --> 26:06.331
I mean, did she say anything about the pain?

26:07.092 --> 26:08.053
Did it change?

26:08.294 --> 26:09.175
How did she sleep?

26:09.635 --> 26:11.397
He says, I don't know about that.

26:11.698 --> 26:12.799
You don't know about that.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.881
That's the person.

26:15.082 --> 26:17.184
That's why I became a doctor.

26:17.344 --> 26:18.666
How does she feel?

26:19.367 --> 26:20.528
Feel is a word.

26:20.989 --> 26:21.770
Feel.

26:21.790 --> 26:25.114
And that's that feel that may be vanishing.

26:25.674 --> 26:26.335
And that bothers you.

26:26.804 --> 26:28.445
Does that disturb you?

26:29.106 --> 26:30.287
Oh, me, of course.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.309
Well, I'm no good at the answer.

26:32.329 --> 26:36.253
Earlier I established the fact, talking to you, that I'm not very good.

26:36.733 --> 26:40.697
Technically, if you ask me about a computer, I'm just learning to use a typewriter.

26:41.818 --> 26:44.981
And so a computer to me is like nuclear physics.

26:45.281 --> 26:48.223
So when you use a language as a computer, I see a language.

26:49.004 --> 26:50.305
Hardware, software.

26:51.266 --> 26:55.410
Hardware to me is a hammer, nails, a pot, a pan.

26:55.795 --> 27:01.400
software, linens, pillowcases, bedspreads, Turkish towels.

27:04.843 --> 27:08.526
You're talking to the wrong guy.

27:08.546 --> 27:09.246
Are you having fun?

27:09.287 --> 27:10.708
Do you have fun?

27:12.409 --> 27:16.112
Well, I try to find humor without humor.

27:17.454 --> 27:18.494
You're a dead man.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.397
Do you have a perceived audience for your book?

27:21.497 --> 27:25.060
Do you have a perceived audience, an audience for your book?

27:25.732 --> 27:29.717
Well, yeah, I think that you're writing these for, I guess, reading them.

27:29.738 --> 27:34.784
Well, I just hope people anywhere will read it.

27:34.885 --> 27:35.966
That's the book.

27:36.246 --> 27:47.762
I mean, I'm happy in the past that a lot of people have all shades of opinion and position in life have read Working and some of the other books.

27:47.782 --> 27:50.286
Mainly the job is my job.

27:51.247 --> 27:55.553
In all these books, it's sort of a bottom-up approach to history.

27:55.955 --> 28:10.015
history from the bottom up, what was it like, and that's the question for you, what was it like to be a certain person in a certain circumstance living at a certain time?

28:10.036 --> 28:24.797
What was it like to be the small boy in 1933 during the Depression to see a father whom he loved and respected, the carpenter, coming home 11 o'clock in the morning with a tool chest on his shoulder, meaning he was canned.

28:26.532 --> 28:34.923
What's it like for the wife, for the guy, and the fights in the family, and the lack of esteem that comes as a result of it?

28:35.904 --> 28:41.391
And as you get that, you might get an idea of what's it like to be jobless today, you see?

28:41.792 --> 28:46.578
So if we attack people on welfare, I remember people on relief, overwhelmingly white.

28:47.299 --> 28:50.463
Well, most people on welfare are white today in America.

28:50.483 --> 28:55.189
But let's say, if we think of black people, then relief.

28:55.658 --> 29:01.625
There were fatherless families, and the guy goes off looking somewhere, dispirited, trying to find a job.

29:01.645 --> 29:02.506
They were just leaving.

29:02.546 --> 29:07.692
There were people investigating, people in relief.

29:07.732 --> 29:10.095
They were called midnight creepers in some quarters.

29:10.536 --> 29:15.381
That is, the caseworker or the inspector to see if there's an old man in the house.

29:15.401 --> 29:17.964
That was a ... See, what was it like to live?

29:18.225 --> 29:24.332
What's it like to be a young infantryman hitting a village just after D-Day?

29:24.582 --> 29:26.464
or of that matter in German.

29:26.804 --> 29:33.572
So what was it like to be a woman having a first job in the war in a defense plant, not to be the kid?

29:34.913 --> 29:37.036
What was it like to do a certain kind of job?

29:37.616 --> 29:43.062
That was the idea, to offer history from below.

29:43.102 --> 29:47.187
There's a Bertolt Brecht poem, but I use the inscription for one.

29:47.647 --> 29:51.111
Like if I were to ask you others, who built the pyramids?

29:51.512 --> 29:54.555
I would really have said, well, the pharaohs, you know.

29:54.704 --> 29:56.126
Pharaoh didn't lift the fingers.

29:56.587 --> 30:01.675
You know, Mrs. Pharaoh, you know, her nails were as immaculate as Elizabeth Taylor's.

30:01.695 --> 30:05.902
You know, anonymous slaves through the centuries built the period.

30:05.982 --> 30:11.030
And so Brecht's poem goes, who built the seven gates of thieves?

30:11.050 --> 30:15.137
I mean, who carried those crags of heavy stone, whatever the phrase is.

30:16.078 --> 30:21.387
And he says, when the Chinese wall was built, where did the masons go for lunch?

30:21.822 --> 30:30.896
When Caesar conquered Gaul, and we get this in Latin one, Caesar's commentaries, you know, all Gaul divided into three parts.

30:31.276 --> 30:35.964
When Caesar conquered Gaul, was there not even a cook in the army?

30:36.685 --> 30:41.372
And then the big one, when the Armada, the Spanish Armada, sank.

30:42.153 --> 30:44.377
And I remember the date even now, 1588.

30:44.997 --> 30:49.264
We got that in school, and we read that Sir Francis Drake,

30:49.413 --> 30:51.015
He conquered the Spanish armada.

30:51.035 --> 30:52.617
He sank the Spanish armada.

30:52.818 --> 30:55.081
Sir Francis Drake all by himself.

30:55.702 --> 30:59.607
You mean he lifted a garter, a knight's garter, and said, Spaniard, surrender?

30:59.647 --> 31:00.128
Was that it?

31:00.808 --> 31:11.743
Sir Francis, and so he, so Beth says, when the armada sank, we read that King Philip, King Philip of Spain, King Philip wept.

31:12.284 --> 31:13.466
And here's the big sentence.

31:14.547 --> 31:16.770
Were there no other tears?

31:17.543 --> 31:24.250
Were there no other tears of those scores of thousands who may have died in those battles?

31:24.270 --> 31:27.793
And that, in a sense, is what I tried to do.

31:27.813 --> 31:29.515
Who wept those other tears?

31:29.916 --> 31:32.078
That's more or less so.

31:32.138 --> 31:37.463
Your passion for the working man and woman is undiminished.

31:37.483 --> 31:40.346
It must be really frustrating to see.

31:42.148 --> 31:45.331
You mentioned that there's no labor news section in the newspaper.

31:45.532 --> 31:46.032
Oh, yeah.

31:46.180 --> 31:56.075
And you wonder, you look at these... I'm asking you to talk politics, Gingrich and everything, but... Well, think of it now.

31:56.837 --> 32:02.826
The labor, that is, American trade unions, had never been in such bad shape.

32:02.846 --> 32:04.308
It's amazing, isn't it?

32:04.348 --> 32:04.509
Yeah.

32:04.589 --> 32:13.082
There's little recurrences now, maybe with a new leadership, maybe with Carrie beating the thugs of the Teamsters Union.

32:13.231 --> 32:27.091
Maybe the little touches and new kinds of unions, but basically, and it has to do with the ignorance, not, I didn't mean stupidity, I mean, the ignorance, lack of knowledge of the history of labor by the young.

32:27.131 --> 32:32.359
Many of the young say, I hate unions, and so I tell this comic story.

32:34.222 --> 32:36.205
You saw that story, me waiting for the bus.

32:36.265 --> 32:37.146
Yeah.

32:37.227 --> 32:40.892
And the guy's reading the Wall Street Journal.

32:40.912 --> 32:42.814
That's right, she's got the Vanity Fair.

32:43.275 --> 32:47.681
It's yuppie, I hate to use the word yuppie, but it is in this instance, an upscale couple.

32:48.282 --> 32:57.574
And I make conversations all the time, and I talk to myself a lot, and I find the audience when I talk to myself very appreciative, you know.

32:57.594 --> 33:05.144
Anyway, I'm trying to make, I say, you know, Labor Day coming up, and they say, we hate unions, and I say, oh boy.

33:05.665 --> 33:07.167
And then I try to say,

33:07.973 --> 33:09.635
You work eight hours a day.

33:09.675 --> 33:11.697
How come you don't work 18 hours a day?

33:11.717 --> 33:13.819
Your great, great grandparents did.

33:13.859 --> 33:16.422
You know why you worked eight and not 18?

33:17.023 --> 33:21.508
Because guys fighting for the eight-hour day got hanged in Chicago.

33:21.808 --> 33:22.869
It's an event way back.

33:23.590 --> 33:28.075
And next thing, I got this guy against the mailbox and he's scared.

33:28.475 --> 33:33.060
And then, and what the wind-up is, how did, why would he know?

33:33.240 --> 33:35.523
And then, as you point earlier, he doesn't know.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.085
Where does he read about labor?

33:37.105 --> 33:37.525
He doesn't.

33:37.893 --> 33:48.146
There's a business section of the paper, sports section, feature section, theater art section style, no labor.

33:48.606 --> 33:50.368
And so as a result, there's no knowledge.

33:50.488 --> 33:52.511
That's part of it.

33:52.591 --> 33:56.936
You don't use, so far as I can see, the good old days.

33:56.996 --> 33:58.859
That's not a phrase that you use.

33:58.879 --> 33:59.560
Oh, no.

33:59.780 --> 34:01.822
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

34:01.842 --> 34:03.264
They were bad old days.

34:03.284 --> 34:06.448
You are promoting the passing of the good old days.

34:06.766 --> 34:13.196
I know, I'm bemoaning the passing of history, of a knowledge what was.

34:13.836 --> 34:17.101
So it was only from the past we learned about a future and a present.

34:17.602 --> 34:22.289
How can we have a present or a future built on zero, on nothing, on a bubble?

34:22.910 --> 34:23.811
There is a past.

34:24.472 --> 34:27.296
And what is it to be learned from that past?

34:28.538 --> 34:30.421
We attack big government, same ones.

34:30.762 --> 34:35.068
And I say the daddies and granddaddies' butts of these guys were saved.

34:35.302 --> 34:36.163
by the New Deal.

34:36.183 --> 34:38.387
Many guys got a job on the WPA.

34:39.268 --> 34:46.400
Ronald Reagan's father got a job on the WPA, the town of Dixon, Illinois, was helped, probably saved by the WPA.

34:46.721 --> 34:48.864
That's the Work Project Administration.

34:49.245 --> 34:50.066
No, I don't.

34:50.146 --> 34:53.371
No, to the young who may be reading you.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.234
And it was part of what's called the New Deal.

34:56.136 --> 34:59.401
Am I saying government, big government's straight?

34:59.461 --> 35:00.583
No, of course it does.

35:00.884 --> 35:02.607
horrendous bureaucratic things.

35:02.727 --> 35:06.032
You mean there's no bureaucracy in private enterprise?

35:06.052 --> 35:13.023
They do wrong things, of course, but it seems to me only when it does something on behalf of those up against it is when it's attacked.

35:13.043 --> 35:23.179
Never attacked for its military expenditures today that are wild and crazy and goofy, when the reason for it, the main reason, evil empire, so-called, is gone.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.665
And yet, here we stood, no one questioned the billions.

35:26.705 --> 35:31.112
I heard of driving down today, I listened to the news stations all the way down.

35:31.132 --> 35:31.954
Oh, it's working?

35:32.194 --> 35:32.655
Yeah.

35:32.935 --> 35:34.979
I always do this.

35:35.319 --> 35:38.384
That red light tells you it's fine.

35:38.405 --> 35:40.648
I'm so suspicious of machines, you know.

35:40.949 --> 35:44.675
Well, I mean, it's so ironic that I've never had a problem with this camera.

35:44.735 --> 35:46.037
Isn't it working?

35:46.238 --> 35:48.281
Oh, it's fine, yeah, but I get rid of the flash.

35:48.622 --> 35:50.044
Oh, you know why it's not working?

35:50.429 --> 35:51.290
Because I'm here.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.532
Well, I think so.

35:53.293 --> 35:54.815
You think I'm kidding.

35:55.436 --> 35:56.377
Many times.

35:56.778 --> 35:58.360
I've never had a breakdown.

35:58.380 --> 36:03.828
There's something, I think the machines know who their enemy and friend is.

36:04.409 --> 36:06.291
And I have difficulty wherever I go.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.354
Elevators don't act as a dude.

36:08.414 --> 36:10.277
People say, they don't behave that way.

36:10.317 --> 36:11.198
But I'm here.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.081
But you know what I did, you see?

36:13.101 --> 36:14.242
Let me explain what I did.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.445
I couldn't get the flash to work.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.186
So I said, okay.

36:17.207 --> 36:17.567
Okay.

36:18.256 --> 36:25.383
I'm traveling with faster film, so I changed, I took out the slower film, and I put in a very fast film, so now I'm shooting with available light.

36:25.563 --> 36:26.224
It is working.

36:26.384 --> 36:27.025
Oh, it's fine.

36:27.105 --> 36:30.288
These pictures will be better, actually, because there won't be any flash.

36:30.308 --> 36:30.688
Great.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.149
So there'll be natural light.

36:32.169 --> 36:32.850
Oh, that's great.

36:33.050 --> 36:36.814
So, but I mean, if I didn't have the faster film, I wouldn't have been able to do that.

36:37.815 --> 36:42.520
Anyway, you know, do you consider yourself a late bloomer when it comes to writing?

36:42.900 --> 36:43.320
I don't know.

36:43.380 --> 36:44.441
Someone called me that.

36:45.002 --> 36:46.103
I guess, well, I didn't...

36:46.302 --> 36:49.107
You were 54, I guess, when you published it?

36:49.127 --> 36:52.774
In 1967, published me in 55.

36:54.137 --> 36:55.820
Got arrived in 53.

36:55.880 --> 37:02.332
Now, I did a book in 1957 for young people, for jazz, called Giants of Jazz.

37:02.893 --> 37:06.640
But this series, called Oral History, is

37:06.923 --> 37:08.224
began when I was 55.

37:08.244 --> 37:11.467
How did you happen onto this concept of oral history?

37:11.487 --> 37:15.590
Well, you're sitting right now in the home of Andre Schifrin, who was my publisher.

37:15.691 --> 37:16.071
Famous?

37:16.992 --> 37:18.893
And Andre's the guy responsible.

37:18.913 --> 37:19.234
Really?

37:19.254 --> 37:26.160
He saw something I'd written, or an interview was republished on the radio station, and he got this idea.

37:26.180 --> 37:34.166
And he had published, before I met him, he had published an American edition of a book by Jan Myrdal.

37:34.247 --> 37:35.968
He's the son of Donald Myrdal.

37:36.286 --> 37:42.213
wrote The American Dilemma, and his mother won the Nobel Peace Prize at group Alvomir.

37:42.233 --> 38:02.136
This is Yan, who visited China shortly after the revolution, and he visited the small town in China, North China, and he's describing changes that took place in the lives, daily lives of these people as a result before and after the revolution.

38:02.156 --> 38:06.040
So Andre Shepard called me shortly thereafter, publishing this book,

38:06.509 --> 38:09.092
report from a Chinese village.

38:09.732 --> 38:12.415
He said, how about you reporting for an American village?

38:12.855 --> 38:13.856
He said, Chicago.

38:14.837 --> 38:31.995
And I said, you out of your mind, how can you compare a city, a huge industrial complex Chicago to a small Chinese village in Chicago where a million things are happening, the civil rights, it was the 60s, the civil rights revolution, the cybernetic revolution, autumn, how can you do that?

38:32.275 --> 38:34.457
But I did it, Division Street America.

38:34.775 --> 38:36.497
And it was rather well received.

38:37.078 --> 38:42.686
So six months later, Andre says again on the phone, how about a book about the Great American Depression?

38:43.868 --> 38:45.710
So I say, are you out of your mind?

38:46.732 --> 38:48.054
And I do the hard times.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.056
And that's well received.

38:50.137 --> 38:52.620
Did you have this phrase, this oral history?

38:53.221 --> 38:56.385
Well, oral history is an old, old phrase, you know.

38:56.405 --> 38:58.769
Yeah, but really where it's the voice of the individual.

38:58.929 --> 38:59.770
Yeah.

39:00.222 --> 39:05.047
The authorial intrusion is... But oral history... If it's there, it's not there.

39:05.387 --> 39:08.570
Oral history has preceded the written word.

39:08.750 --> 39:11.232
You know, before the printing press, there was oral history.

39:11.553 --> 39:12.794
People are storytellers.

39:12.834 --> 39:14.936
Those people Alex Haley talked about.

39:15.376 --> 39:19.200
The Griots were there long before Gutenberg invented the printing press.

39:19.220 --> 39:23.203
And in America, Appalachian country, are still storytellers.

39:23.804 --> 39:28.148
So, in fact, I'm not really a historian, a scholar.

39:28.168 --> 39:29.149
I'm not a scholar.

39:29.517 --> 39:34.221
So I call myself a maybe oral journalism or a guerrilla journalist.

39:34.582 --> 39:38.805
And I think earlier you asked how I work, and I say improvise around.

39:39.426 --> 39:43.770
Well, a journalist does work with the immediate, I guess, and the historian evaluates.

39:44.270 --> 39:48.854
So what would you feel that you're providing the raw material then for future historians?

39:48.874 --> 39:49.595
Yeah, in a sense.

39:49.635 --> 39:53.038
Someone did say that about the books.

39:53.058 --> 39:58.663
But the idea of people telling about their lives

39:59.268 --> 40:02.511
It was also done way before me during the New Deal.

40:03.352 --> 40:05.955
I mentioned the WPA, the Work Project Administration.

40:05.975 --> 40:08.037
They had a writer's project.

40:08.478 --> 40:11.421
They had a theater project.

40:11.441 --> 40:16.967
And then the writer's project, different writers in different states were seeing old people.

40:17.988 --> 40:26.237
In fact, them old black people were slaves, and this was in the 30s, were still slaves in their childhood, remembering the early days.

40:26.555 --> 40:32.063
And there was railroad folklore and all sorts of American folklore that was gathered.

40:32.083 --> 40:38.471
That was also oral history, in a way, that the people on this New Deal project were doing.

40:38.491 --> 40:44.319
Now, when you sat down with your subjects here, did you have a script?

40:44.500 --> 40:46.923
Did you have an agenda to pursue?

40:46.943 --> 40:47.123
No.

40:47.143 --> 40:49.487
Or did you pretty much... No.

40:49.507 --> 40:51.229
It's the nature of conversation.

40:51.935 --> 40:55.780
I had an idea about what's going to be about working, about the job.

40:56.140 --> 40:57.482
What's it like to be a welder?

40:57.542 --> 40:58.463
Tell me about your day.

40:58.483 --> 41:00.446
But I mean this particular book here.

41:00.466 --> 41:01.247
Oh, no, no.

41:01.688 --> 41:05.613
No, it's just certain old people I wanted, certain contemporaries.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.255
I wanted to see David Brower.

41:07.755 --> 41:11.460
He thought of the enfant terrible, the environmental movement.

41:11.480 --> 41:18.349
David Brower would find earth, you know, friends, earth, or he found a group to fight the polluters.

41:18.769 --> 41:21.553
But then if the group got a little soft, he'd leave it and

41:21.803 --> 41:24.246
found another group, more militant.

41:24.686 --> 41:28.170
And each time he would do this, it makes it easier for the ones who follow me.

41:28.290 --> 41:31.113
They seem so reasonable in contrast to me.

41:31.133 --> 41:32.875
I want to make them seem reasonable.

41:33.336 --> 41:35.979
Well, David Brower, I ought to get him in the book.

41:35.999 --> 41:40.504
And he said, he more or less, he's in the prologue, and he more or less sets the theme.

41:40.524 --> 41:46.070
He says, you know, this century is the wildest, craziest century he's ever been.

41:46.110 --> 41:50.595
The Great Depression, World War II that changed the world,

41:50.997 --> 41:58.264
The Cold War that killed conversation and still to some extent has treated trivia instead of conversation.

41:58.825 --> 42:03.389
The Vietnam War, the computers, all this in this one central.

42:03.409 --> 42:04.330
The Holocaust.

42:05.291 --> 42:08.054
And the Holocaust, of course, and Hiroshima.

42:08.094 --> 42:08.474
Unprecedented.

42:08.494 --> 42:10.436
Auschwitz and Hiroshima.

42:10.496 --> 42:19.165
Think about a man who has created Hamlet and Don Giovanni and Beethoven did the Ninth

42:19.735 --> 42:33.009
as also the same species has done Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Auschwitz, the same generation almost.

42:33.029 --> 42:42.218
And he says, there's been no one like us ever before, and there'll be no one like us ever again, so tell your story now.

42:43.560 --> 42:48.865
So he said, so I had to get him, I had to get a labor guy, so I got Dick Ruther, another guy.

42:49.013 --> 42:52.519
How to get this old woman who's just around, no rule.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.284
But people are kind of fired.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.768
I love that woman who says she fights sleep.

42:58.788 --> 43:00.251
She doesn't want to sleep.

43:00.271 --> 43:01.493
Oh, the old Ian Bessie Donner.

43:01.513 --> 43:02.234
Isn't that wonderful?

43:02.254 --> 43:03.055
Bessie's 94.

43:03.175 --> 43:04.798
She's so afraid she won't wake up again.

43:04.818 --> 43:05.859
Yeah, Bessie's 90.

43:05.900 --> 43:07.823
She wants to stay awake as often as she can.

43:07.843 --> 43:10.026
And Bessie's the one also who says,

43:10.698 --> 43:16.187
I watch TV and sometimes I take a little nip, a touch of scotch.

43:16.468 --> 43:17.069
Good for her.

43:17.089 --> 43:19.613
Because the men on everything look good.

43:20.935 --> 43:23.619
And when I got this, my legs get numb on me.

43:24.020 --> 43:28.067
And that doctor, I got a woman doctor, she'd just bang your legs against the floor.

43:28.507 --> 43:32.314
So I bang my legs against the floor and I feel so much better.

43:32.334 --> 43:34.377
I love the shock quote that you start with.

43:34.846 --> 43:35.387
What?

43:35.407 --> 43:41.033
I love the Bernard Shaw quote that you... Oh, yeah, the very beginning of the introduction.

43:41.333 --> 43:42.455
Yeah, it's just wonderful.

43:42.615 --> 43:46.279
I want to be thoroughly used up when I die.

43:46.299 --> 43:47.580
Fully used up when I die.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.224
Well, many of them feel that way.

43:51.244 --> 43:54.027
Well, I'll tell you, we've gone through a pretty good hour here.

43:54.068 --> 43:54.748
This is good.

43:54.788 --> 43:56.150
You know, this has gone pretty well.

43:56.510 --> 43:57.191
Yeah, we're good.

43:57.531 --> 43:58.112
I have fun.

43:59.373 --> 44:00.935
I've really been looking forward to this.

44:00.955 --> 44:01.756
I am too.

44:01.776 --> 44:03.418
And I'll write this up and

44:03.871 --> 44:06.454
You got an address in the... Where does it appear?

44:06.634 --> 44:08.176
Well, I have a syndicate, a newspaper.

44:08.276 --> 44:08.737
Oh, how?

44:08.757 --> 44:09.277
Put together.

44:09.337 --> 44:10.399
I'm an entrepreneur.

44:10.479 --> 44:11.700
Oh, I see.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.262
Well, you don't need, you don't need this on a tape.

44:13.282 --> 44:14.524
That's my home address.

44:14.544 --> 44:14.764
Okay.

44:14.784 --> 44:17.707
Eight, eight, eight, what do you want it?

44:18.288 --> 44:19.089
It'll be in there.

44:19.189 --> 44:21.532
Oh, eight, my home address, Studs Terkel.

44:22.253 --> 44:23.014
All right.

44:23.034 --> 44:30.202
850 Castlewood, Castle, C-S-T-L-E-W-O-O-D, Terrace or Castlewood.

44:30.222 --> 44:31.043
Chicago,

44:31.428 --> 44:32.509
60640.

44:32.609 --> 44:36.312
One of the great cities in America.

44:36.392 --> 44:36.973
Oh, it is.

44:37.553 --> 44:37.713
It is.

44:37.733 --> 44:38.434
I love Chicago.

44:38.454 --> 44:41.777
I was out there for the ABA in June.

44:42.237 --> 44:42.998
Oh, yeah, yeah.

44:43.038 --> 44:44.419
Would you inscribe this for me?

44:44.479 --> 44:45.800
Well, I've been delighted to.

44:47.181 --> 44:48.783
It's Nicholas Bunman.

44:49.123 --> 44:49.723
Yeah.

44:49.743 --> 44:50.164
Nicholas?

44:50.344 --> 44:50.965
Nicholas.

44:50.985 --> 44:51.745
Here's my card.

44:52.246 --> 44:53.146
I'll give you my card.

44:53.507 --> 44:54.748
Bunman.

44:56.229 --> 44:58.010
Yeah, that's it.

44:58.211 --> 44:58.771
What's next?

44:59.672 --> 45:01.013
Oh, God, that's a good question.

45:01.381 --> 45:02.983
That's what next to three.

45:04.024 --> 45:05.205
I'm sort of optimistic.

45:06.686 --> 45:07.567
I'm 83.

45:08.107 --> 45:08.448
I don't know.

45:08.488 --> 45:12.612
Maybe I'm thinking out loud about writing.

45:13.313 --> 45:14.954
You see, I still have self-doubt.

45:15.234 --> 45:16.876
I always have writing.

45:16.896 --> 45:22.581
Of course, a lot of the stuff with the words of other people, which I work at, of course, and edit and gather.

45:23.062 --> 45:28.367
And introductions is where I write, as well as a book called Talking to Myself.

45:29.208 --> 45:48.528
And so perhaps I was thinking about the introductions in each one of the different books, and maybe five or six of the portraits in each of those books that would have a sort of chronological or a sort of mood continuity at the same time my own writing would be in it.

45:48.548 --> 45:57.477
And I also did a long introduction to the 50th anniversary issue of Grapes of Wrath.

45:57.710 --> 46:03.195
Elaine Steinbrecht, the widow of John Steinbrecht, asked if I would do it.

46:03.215 --> 46:04.396
I have a copy of that.

46:04.576 --> 46:05.617
You got the 50th edition?

46:05.637 --> 46:06.558
I've also got the first.

46:06.938 --> 46:09.300
I've got the first edition, and I have the 50th, too.

46:09.340 --> 46:11.162
The 50th has my introduction.

46:11.883 --> 46:12.884
That's right.

46:13.204 --> 46:13.724
Okay.

46:13.804 --> 46:14.525
And something like that.

46:14.665 --> 46:27.717
In that introduction, I just realized, is a composite of many of the other interviews, because it deals with OTs and poverty, and I have some of the opposite numbers in these books.

46:28.186 --> 46:31.914
and some changing as they got prosperous.

46:31.934 --> 46:33.316
So in a way, it's about that.

46:33.737 --> 46:34.218
That's great.

46:34.238 --> 46:34.799
So we'll see.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.022
Maybe, maybe.

46:36.162 --> 46:37.685
I'm horsing around.

46:38.567 --> 46:39.910
Anyway, this is great.

46:39.930 --> 46:42.415
Well, we're going to get a great story out of this.
