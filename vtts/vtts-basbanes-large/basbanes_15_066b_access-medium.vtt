00:02.596 --> 00:12.848
The reason that we have to move this and have a National Museum in Washington is that there's so little display space here at the Museum of the American Union.

00:13.268 --> 00:14.029
It's fairly big, but it's small.

00:14.049 --> 00:16.192
It only shows a small percentage.

00:16.292 --> 00:25.222
If you take us to a building, it's probably about the size of this lobby and three stories and in the blocks and looks like a block house.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.804
You have a cinder block on the outside.

00:26.904 --> 00:27.825
Very few windows.

00:27.845 --> 00:30.509
You never know what it is, but it's easily defended.

00:30.529 --> 00:31.810
And you go into it

00:32.093 --> 00:38.640
And you open a door, and there's a little place about like this, with a thousand Pueblo pots.

00:39.281 --> 00:44.647
Each absolutely distinct, the product of an individual craftsperson.

00:44.667 --> 00:48.611
You open a drawer in another room, and there's a hundred beaded vests.

00:49.392 --> 00:51.054
They have a million objects.

00:51.834 --> 00:52.775
One million.

00:53.076 --> 00:56.059
Each one priceless, replaceable, perfect.

00:56.478 --> 00:58.801
And so now they're going to do this.

00:59.001 --> 01:11.136
When we were in Seattle on this tour, we did a benefit for that museum because it's going to be a completely donated by the public product if there's no money in the government.

01:11.156 --> 01:13.438
But it will be extraordinary.

01:13.839 --> 01:19.706
And this was all this man who went around the country and paid H-E-Y-E.

01:20.266 --> 01:21.147
H-E-Y-E.

01:21.608 --> 01:24.932
This is his last name.

01:25.165 --> 01:45.210
And just used to ship things back, and some of them taken, I should say, inappropriately, and those will be returned under a congressional act when it can be proven that he came by some of these artifacts through chicanery or whatever.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.791
Those are going to be returned to the tribes.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.616
But many of them he did buy, and they came back by the tree, too.

01:51.357 --> 01:52.118
Isn't this amazing?

01:52.267 --> 01:55.614
Is there any information on that?

01:55.654 --> 01:56.175
Yeah.

01:56.195 --> 01:57.358
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:57.378 --> 01:58.621
What's your first name?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.204
Do you remember up there?

02:01.106 --> 02:01.327
H-E-Y-E.

02:01.547 --> 02:05.816
It's the Museum of the American Indian in New York City, 155th Street in Broadway.

02:06.798 --> 02:08.703
And they have brochures about that.

02:09.905 --> 02:10.326
Oh.

02:11.588 --> 02:32.037
This is the kind of supplement that you're seeing.

02:32.057 --> 02:33.198
I'm going to let these people return to your family.

02:33.218 --> 02:34.801
We've been talking about discovery and artifacts and wonderful collections.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.583
I was thinking really hard about the origins of going to that little library and finding

02:37.103 --> 02:56.622
the transcription of Columbus' diaries and what processes it started.

02:56.642 --> 03:01.587
I think it really was a kind of... The last documents that no one had are such a profound weight.

03:01.607 --> 03:02.588
Once we knew more about

03:03.715 --> 03:16.367
the Lost Diary, we began to, I think, invent it in our minds.

03:16.387 --> 03:20.998
It is almost a mad thing to do.

03:21.518 --> 03:42.861
obsessed with how real is that scripture?

03:42.882 --> 03:43.342
What is he really said?

03:43.362 --> 03:44.103
And I really felt a kind of sandwich.

03:44.123 --> 03:44.904
It's a wonderful thing I could imagine.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.986
After this book is published and everything, if that diary was ever found, I mean, it's not impossible.

03:46.966 --> 03:48.790
It's not possible.

03:48.810 --> 03:50.695
And everybody says it is possible.

03:50.755 --> 03:52.038
I mean, things do come the way.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.965
I have stories about it in my book.

03:55.025 --> 03:56.047
I mean, this stuff happens.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.874
I just found a declaration really fast.

03:58.894 --> 04:01.380
I believe that was stolen from me.
