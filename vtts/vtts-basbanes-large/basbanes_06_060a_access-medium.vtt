WEBVTT

00:03.592 --> 00:04.954
I'm putting this on, okay?

00:06.075 --> 00:09.359
We're with Mr. Dave Kirshenbaum in New York at the Carnegie Bookshop.

00:09.379 --> 00:10.680
I just want to identify the tape.

00:10.700 --> 00:15.726
And you just told me you have a catalog of George D. Smith when he was selling things for $2.

00:15.866 --> 00:27.119
How you doing?

00:31.664 --> 00:32.265
David Redden?

00:32.431 --> 00:33.933
Yeah, I'm going to give it to David.

00:34.774 --> 00:35.274
Well, you know what?

00:35.294 --> 00:37.517
You could loan it to me, and I'll give it back to you.

00:39.138 --> 00:39.739
Sadler.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.282
I have that Sadler set over there.

00:42.322 --> 00:43.303
I've got to shut this off later.

00:44.784 --> 00:48.488
So anyway, you said that you may well be the only person alive.

00:48.589 --> 00:49.670
Oh, I don't know of anybody.

00:49.690 --> 00:50.431
But it's possible.

00:50.811 --> 00:51.812
I don't know of anybody.

00:51.832 --> 00:52.813
I don't remember.

00:52.833 --> 00:54.815
I don't remember anybody.

00:54.936 --> 00:56.357
Did you attend as a bookman?

00:56.838 --> 00:57.118
Yes.

00:58.139 --> 01:00.902
And so were you there bidding and...

01:01.169 --> 01:02.891
Hoping to bid or buy?

01:03.011 --> 01:04.493
That's right.

01:04.513 --> 01:05.354
How old were you then?

01:06.255 --> 01:08.438
Well, I was born in 95.

01:08.658 --> 01:13.044
I'll be 95 January 5.

01:14.946 --> 01:18.791
God bless you.

01:18.811 --> 01:19.632
What's your secret?

01:20.593 --> 01:22.115
Is there a secret to this?

01:22.135 --> 01:24.298
No secret.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.539
I've been in this business.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.423
I opened in 1910.

01:28.503 --> 01:29.144
Here in New York?

01:29.164 --> 01:30.906
In New York.

01:31.055 --> 01:42.808
I've been in New York ever since, and I've attended every important sale, every sale as a matter of fact, important and non-important.

01:42.828 --> 01:48.194
Would you say that you do most of your acquiring at options, or do you also do private advertising?

01:48.214 --> 01:48.374
No, no.

01:48.394 --> 01:50.116
Years ago, I used to buy big libraries.

01:50.156 --> 01:52.659
You see, I had a very big place I had to attend.

01:53.320 --> 01:59.627
I now dribble down to doing specifics only.

02:00.923 --> 02:02.305
I had a very big place.

02:02.365 --> 02:06.550
I had a place 30 times, 40 times the size.

02:07.871 --> 02:11.175
Must have had two, three hundred thousand books.

02:11.656 --> 02:12.897
Wow.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.761
And I was there for 59th Street.

02:15.861 --> 02:17.463
I was there for 50 years.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.766
Was it also called the Carnegie Bookshop?

02:19.786 --> 02:19.886
Yeah.

02:20.927 --> 02:24.992
Has it always been called the Carnegie Bookshop, your business?

02:25.012 --> 02:25.092
Yes.

02:26.827 --> 02:29.451
And you said you used to buy entire libraries.

02:29.511 --> 02:31.574
I used to buy entire libraries, yes.

02:31.594 --> 02:33.476
And I'd buy at auction.

02:34.177 --> 02:35.619
I'd buy for customers.

02:36.701 --> 02:41.047
You, as I understand it, were extremely friendly with Bradley Martin.

02:41.187 --> 02:41.908
Very friendly.

02:42.028 --> 02:45.153
For fifty years, I used to see him.

02:45.413 --> 02:48.597
I had lunch with him two or three times a week.

02:48.617 --> 02:52.743
Were you largely responsible for building his library?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.105
A great many of the things.

02:54.205 --> 02:55.467
He bought all over the world.

02:56.510 --> 03:01.677
Would you judge him as one of the great book collectors of your lifetime?

03:01.697 --> 03:03.880
No question about it.

03:03.900 --> 03:10.288
In terms of not only the quality of the collection, but also what other qualities would you say?

03:10.529 --> 03:20.021
Well, first of all, he was particular about condition.

03:20.041 --> 03:23.826
And if he didn't want a thing, no matter what it was, he wouldn't buy it.

03:25.088 --> 03:25.909
And if he'd want it,

03:27.307 --> 03:31.914
And he'd show him something, he'd sit right here where you're sitting, and I would show him something.

03:32.515 --> 03:38.405
No matter what I'd say, he'd take out his wallet, write a check right, sit down.

03:38.425 --> 03:46.317
Was he the kind of collector who, and as we talk about Bradley Martin, I'm looking at his catalogs of his books over there, yeah, because I know the books.

03:47.038 --> 03:50.604
He is one collector who really knew his books.

03:50.624 --> 03:52.487
Oh, yes.

03:52.602 --> 03:55.826
I'm sure there are collectors who don't even know half of the things that they have.

03:55.906 --> 03:58.149
That's an accumulator.

03:58.169 --> 03:59.491
That's not a collector.

03:59.511 --> 04:01.654
Maybe you can define the difference for me.

04:02.355 --> 04:04.738
Could you characterize one from the other?

04:04.778 --> 04:07.442
Well, you know, there are some people that are accumulators.

04:07.502 --> 04:09.805
You know, they'll take anything.

04:10.205 --> 04:15.953
But there are some people that are very careful with what they eat.

04:17.094 --> 04:19.738
You've got to give them certain things.

04:19.758 --> 04:22.221
Were you disappointed that the Martin collection

04:22.437 --> 04:25.560
was sold, do you think it should have been kept together as a unit?

04:26.361 --> 04:29.424
Well, that's been going on for many years.

04:30.526 --> 04:39.655
I had taught to Bradley, and Mrs. Martin, and Gordon Ray, who he was very fond of.

04:39.876 --> 04:45.882
Gordon Ray was head of the Guggenheim Foundation.

04:45.902 --> 04:52.309
And we tried to get the collection, burned the collection.

04:53.572 --> 04:54.854
That's probably the copy.

04:56.757 --> 04:59.341
You were saying that Bradley Martin's interest was birds.

04:59.401 --> 05:01.023
I think that was the last thing that you said.

05:01.584 --> 05:07.674
Well, his bird books were extraordinary.

05:09.797 --> 05:14.604
It was really a great collection.

05:14.624 --> 05:17.689
It was even suggested that there was perhaps the greatest

05:18.175 --> 05:20.498
ornithological collection anywhere.

05:20.538 --> 05:21.319
No, that's right.

05:21.339 --> 05:24.242
And that might have been an argument for keeping it as a unit.

05:24.502 --> 05:25.543
That's right.

05:25.563 --> 05:27.185
How did you personally feel about that?

05:27.205 --> 05:28.887
Did it bother you to see it broken up?

05:28.967 --> 05:35.014
Well, yes, in a way, because it'll never be put together again.

05:37.577 --> 05:44.605
And yet there's the argument on the other side that was used for Robert Ho, it was suggested for Bradley Martin,

05:45.040 --> 05:50.185
That where would the collectors of tomorrow be if people didn't allow their books to go back into the marketplace?

05:50.466 --> 05:51.187
That's true.

05:52.067 --> 05:52.688
That's true.

05:54.070 --> 05:55.571
How do you feel about that?

05:55.591 --> 06:00.476
Well, I feel that he wanted to give it away, but... You think he did?

06:00.957 --> 06:03.219
He wanted to give it away as a unit, or he wanted to... As a unit.

06:03.419 --> 06:03.740
He did?

06:04.000 --> 06:04.280
Yes.

06:07.183 --> 06:10.267
Why didn't he... He was so careful about everything else in his lifetime.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.228
Well, he was very careful.

06:11.608 --> 06:13.410
He wanted to give it to the Smithsonian.

06:15.382 --> 06:22.733
It didn't work out.

06:23.053 --> 06:27.340
You mean he just never got around to it?

06:27.420 --> 06:29.944
No, he did go around to it.

06:29.964 --> 06:32.407
The association, they didn't handle it properly.

06:32.427 --> 06:32.788
Really?

06:34.651 --> 06:36.093
That's too bad.

06:36.273 --> 06:38.797
We went to Indiana, we thought they wanted it.

06:39.297 --> 06:40.479
Lilly, the Lilly Library?

06:40.619 --> 06:42.402
Yeah, that's quite an extraordinary library.

06:43.867 --> 06:50.334
there with Mrs. Morton, and it just didn't materialize.

06:51.055 --> 06:57.382
Then he got sick, you know, and he was sick for quite a time.

06:57.402 --> 07:09.655
And up to, up to, very recent, I mean, I used to see him, as I said, two or three times a week, we'd sit and talk, he'd show me

07:10.158 --> 07:15.925
all the catalogs that came in, and he'd mark off, you know, show me what he ordered.

07:15.945 --> 07:19.149
We'd discuss things.

07:19.249 --> 07:20.951
Of course, he was a gentleman.

07:20.992 --> 07:22.974
He was a patrician in the truest sense.

07:23.214 --> 07:23.655
Oh, yes.

07:24.155 --> 07:30.163
But I also understand that he was very conscious of what he was paying for things, too.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.786
I mean, he did not want to overpay.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.507
Is that correct?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.670
Well, I wouldn't make that statement.

07:35.970 --> 07:39.034
No, if he wanted a thing, he'd buy it.

07:39.976 --> 07:44.220
and worry about how much it costs later.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.062
Let's go back to the beginning with yourself.

07:46.603 --> 07:55.672
Now, if you were at the wholesale in 1911 and 1912, you were just 16, 17, 18 years old.

07:55.692 --> 07:59.636
When I was 13, I went to Libby's in Boston.

07:59.657 --> 08:02.179
There was an auction there.

08:03.921 --> 08:05.262
Wow.

08:05.322 --> 08:07.865
Let's start from the beginning, because I don't know very much about you.

08:07.905 --> 08:08.906
Now, are you born in New York?

08:09.367 --> 08:09.747
Yes.

08:10.672 --> 08:13.636
And how did you become fascinated with books?

08:13.996 --> 08:18.202
How did you become... Well, that's a question that I can't answer.

08:18.222 --> 08:22.487
You know, you have to urge yourself books for the Salvation Army.

08:22.988 --> 08:23.889
And how old were you then?

08:24.429 --> 08:25.711
Well, I was about 12 or 13.

08:25.951 --> 08:26.392
Uh-huh.

08:26.993 --> 08:32.620
In those years when you were 12 or 13, you were a man.

08:32.640 --> 08:39.008
Today, you're 12 or 13, you're... I have grandchildren that are...

08:39.798 --> 08:43.602
Nine and ten years old, they're infants, you know.

08:43.622 --> 08:43.883
That's right.

08:43.923 --> 08:48.608
We have our daughters who are eight and seven, and, you know, they're in first and second grade.

08:48.628 --> 08:59.701
Well, you know, if you have daughters, I have nieces, but I have six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

08:59.721 --> 09:01.443
Wow.

09:01.463 --> 09:02.644
So you're 12 or 13.

09:02.724 --> 09:07.009
How did you know it was books that this was going to be your interest in them?

09:07.029 --> 09:07.630
I didn't know.

09:07.650 --> 09:08.691
I made a living at it.

09:09.211 --> 09:10.353
So really, it was neat.

09:10.514 --> 09:11.776
That's right.

09:11.796 --> 09:14.642
It wasn't love, shall we say, or obsession, or fascination.

09:14.742 --> 09:15.504
It wasn't love.

09:15.644 --> 09:19.412
I got into it, and I pursued it.

09:20.414 --> 09:21.797
And you went to Boston, you said?

09:21.897 --> 09:27.609
I went to Boston to a sale, and I attended every sale here in New York and in Philadelphia.

09:27.629 --> 09:27.709
Wow.

09:28.853 --> 09:32.596
Did you know a lot of these people whose libraries were disposed of?

09:33.037 --> 09:35.559
Like, for instance, let's start with the Great Hole auction, for instance.

09:35.599 --> 09:36.620
Well, I didn't know Hole.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.481
You didn't know Hole, but did you know Morgan?

09:38.681 --> 09:39.362
Did you know J.P.

09:39.402 --> 09:39.802
Morgan?

09:39.903 --> 09:40.323
Oh, yes.

09:41.184 --> 09:43.686
Tell me about him as a collector.

09:44.346 --> 09:51.312
Well, he was a... How would you compare him to Bradley Martin, shall we say, in terms of... Well, there was a difference there, you see.

09:51.593 --> 09:54.515
There was a difference in collecting.

09:55.296 --> 09:57.898
Bradley was a more cultured man.

09:59.870 --> 10:06.196
Would you say then that perhaps Morgan was closer to an accumulator than a collector?

10:09.499 --> 10:12.782
No, but he had his mind set for certain things, you see.

10:12.802 --> 10:15.344
He was a very rich man, you know.

10:15.504 --> 10:16.125
Obviously, yeah.

10:16.145 --> 10:17.847
And so was Huntington, of course.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.348
So was Huntington.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.270
Huntington revolutionized book buying.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.951
He used to be bought en bloc.

10:23.152 --> 10:23.592
En bloc.

10:23.652 --> 10:25.253
The phrase came in with him, didn't it?

10:25.273 --> 10:25.634
That's right.

10:25.774 --> 10:26.214
That's right.

10:26.294 --> 10:29.117
And so within four or five years, he was able to put together

10:29.755 --> 10:30.696
He bought everything.

10:31.056 --> 10:31.497
Everything.

10:33.419 --> 10:36.542
And did you ever meet any of these people, Huntington or Morgan?

10:37.262 --> 10:42.307
No, I met Morgan's brother, Henry Morgan.

10:43.108 --> 10:49.114
I had some letters from him, yeah.

10:49.134 --> 10:51.015
But the other collectors I knew as well.

10:52.997 --> 10:55.780
Who would you say are some of the great collectors alive today?

10:57.093 --> 11:00.256
Do they compare with the collectors of the Golden Age?

11:00.637 --> 11:01.377
Well, I wouldn't know.

11:01.918 --> 11:06.383
Dealers had certain, you know.

11:06.403 --> 11:10.387
Well, from what you can see, I mean, this Richard Manny, for instance, who bought the Shakespeare's.

11:10.787 --> 11:11.788
Yeah, yeah.

11:11.808 --> 11:13.550
I guess he's moving pretty quickly, isn't he?

11:13.570 --> 11:14.491
He's moving very heavily.

11:14.511 --> 11:15.732
He takes two million.

11:15.752 --> 11:16.213
Two million.

11:16.293 --> 11:17.634
That's right.

11:17.654 --> 11:19.336
One point nine plus the, you know.

11:19.436 --> 11:20.417
Plus the commission.

11:20.517 --> 11:21.859
The commission, yeah.

11:21.879 --> 11:25.122
I mean, he was sitting right next to me at the sale when he bought it.

11:25.142 --> 11:25.482
He was?

11:25.723 --> 11:26.003
Yeah.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.014
What were you thinking?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.696
I mean, they were going up for $50,000 pops.

11:30.238 --> 11:31.359
He has a dealer.

11:31.379 --> 11:32.401
Jim Cummins.

11:32.421 --> 11:33.041
Jim Cummins.

11:33.402 --> 11:33.642
Jim Cummins.

11:33.662 --> 11:37.607
Jim was sitting next to me, and he was sitting right next to Jim.

11:38.308 --> 11:41.692
And he'd tell them, go ahead, Jim.

11:41.712 --> 11:42.933
What was going through your mind?

11:42.953 --> 11:51.824
Now, you were at the wholesale where the Gutenberg Bible sold for $50,000, and that was considered the greatest, the most, the greatest thing that ever happened.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.566
And that price stood for years and years.

11:53.586 --> 11:54.067
That's right.

11:54.087 --> 11:55.669
And here, you're at an auction.

11:55.987 --> 11:58.010
where the increments are $50,000.

11:58.451 --> 12:02.857
I mean, what do you think when you see what has happened in your lifetime?

12:02.877 --> 12:03.558
I can't think.

12:04.240 --> 12:10.429
I sold things to people where they come up at auction and they bring 40 to 50 times.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.136
What they bought them for.

12:15.296 --> 12:15.617
Yeah.

12:16.158 --> 12:17.640
What you sold them for.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.101
Sure.

12:20.164 --> 12:20.945
I could prove it.

12:21.145 --> 12:24.390
I could give you examples of things that

12:24.775 --> 12:34.525
that I sold Martin, bought up on birds.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.588
Well, that went for three million.

12:38.409 --> 12:38.670
How much?

12:38.990 --> 12:41.893
Didn't the Japanese buy it for three million or something like that?

12:41.913 --> 12:42.353
No, no.

12:42.794 --> 12:45.997
Three million, nine hundred dollars, almost four million dollars.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.320
Twenty-nine thousand dollars.

12:49.381 --> 12:50.462
My God, you're so confused.

12:51.623 --> 12:53.165
And it was a perfect copy, too.

12:53.325 --> 12:55.829
The finest copy I've ever seen.

12:55.849 --> 12:58.853
Did he request that particular copy from you?

12:58.873 --> 13:01.577
Did he ask you to purchase that copy for him?

13:01.597 --> 13:03.420
Yeah, that particular copy she's asking.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.442
Not particular copy.

13:04.482 --> 13:06.084
No, not that particular copy.

13:06.484 --> 13:09.950
He sent me to Philadelphia to look at a copy.

13:11.432 --> 13:14.196
And I went there, spent all day, and I came back.

13:14.937 --> 13:17.701
He was living at that time on Sutton Place.

13:18.442 --> 13:20.685
And I said, Bradley, this is not your...

13:21.188 --> 13:22.650
This is not your quality.

13:23.410 --> 13:29.617
It was, when you turned the pages, they were torn and they were spotted.

13:29.637 --> 13:33.221
And I said, look, there's one in London I could buy for $29,000.

13:33.241 --> 13:35.003
Let me buy that one for you.

13:35.664 --> 13:36.605
So I ordered it.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.246
So he said, fine.

13:37.606 --> 13:37.806
Sure.

13:38.427 --> 13:40.469
How much was the one in Philadelphia going for?

13:40.489 --> 13:41.170
$21,000.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.612
So we're talking $8,000.

13:43.653 --> 13:46.155
But $8,000 was a lot of money in those days.

13:46.896 --> 13:48.698
But he wanted the perfect copy.

13:50.483 --> 13:51.524
And look what it went for.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.387
Any other examples like that?

13:54.407 --> 14:02.074
That's quite an extraordinary... No, I mean, there are lots of things that he bought.

14:06.799 --> 14:08.961
Actually, I can get that stuff out of the catalog.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.562
I think that's in the catalog.

14:10.623 --> 14:11.904
I have the catalogs at home.

14:11.924 --> 14:14.626
Well, there's a new catalog that's going to be out now.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.330
I wrote the introduction to this... Oh, really?

14:18.783 --> 14:20.965
For the one that's coming down in a couple weeks?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.168
Or the one that's coming down at the end of January?

14:23.228 --> 14:23.648
That's right.

14:24.329 --> 14:25.751
The big one, the Americano one?

14:25.831 --> 14:26.071
Yeah.

14:26.271 --> 14:28.354
Oh, that's supposed to be a wonderful auction.

14:28.974 --> 14:29.074
Yeah.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.015
I'm going to come to that.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.517
I'm going to seek you out.

14:31.577 --> 14:33.079
I might even sit near you.

14:33.219 --> 14:35.682
Come on, sit with me.

14:36.363 --> 14:37.504
So you haven't missed any of them?

14:38.285 --> 14:38.565
No.

14:39.386 --> 14:40.527
Did you know Jerome Curran?

14:41.128 --> 14:45.232
No, I knew him well and knew his lawyer.

14:45.573 --> 14:47.575
How do you explain a collector like Curran?

14:48.230 --> 14:53.176
I guess what I'm driving at is he decided to give everything up, to get rid of everything.

14:54.217 --> 15:01.165
Well, things were at that peak, you know, and he sold everything.

15:02.046 --> 15:04.569
And then he went in again for collecting.

15:06.251 --> 15:07.232
I mean, it wasn't the same.

15:07.252 --> 15:17.123
Do you think that he typifies a lot of the kind of collector who the drive is to acquire?

15:17.525 --> 15:20.028
And once you have it, you almost lose interest in it?

15:20.288 --> 15:23.172
I had a customer that came in years ago, 1929.

15:23.372 --> 15:30.441
I got him interested in Walt Whitman, Charles Feinberg.

15:32.944 --> 15:34.726
And he just died.

15:36.028 --> 15:38.791
He gave his whole collection to the Library of Congress.

15:39.492 --> 15:40.273
I know that, yeah.

15:40.293 --> 15:40.494
What?

15:40.734 --> 15:41.515
I've heard that.

15:42.536 --> 15:44.899
He was your customer?

15:46.263 --> 15:50.347
It wasn't a day in the week that he didn't talk to me, you know.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.990
I'd buy all this stuff for him.

15:54.010 --> 15:57.453
I'd buy it everywhere.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.495
Did you get him the first Leaves of Grass?

15:59.975 --> 16:00.656
Yes.

16:00.716 --> 16:03.599
That's one of the toughest American books there is to get.

16:04.459 --> 16:05.901
There's been dozens around.

16:05.921 --> 16:06.781
Bradley has one.

16:08.163 --> 16:12.106
We're talking about a book that's probably going to go for $150,000, $200,000, maybe more.

16:12.266 --> 16:13.607
Leaves of Grass?

16:13.627 --> 16:14.228
Yeah.

16:14.967 --> 16:17.811
The first one now, the privately printed one.

16:18.311 --> 16:18.732
1855.

16:18.752 --> 16:18.952
Right.

16:19.132 --> 16:19.953
That's right.

16:20.994 --> 16:23.417
Well, how much do you think that's going to go for in fine condition?

16:24.779 --> 16:25.340
$25,000.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.923
That's all.

16:28.003 --> 16:30.386
I thought that would command more than that.

16:33.890 --> 16:40.298
I lost my... Well, would you say that Kern was buying as an investor or as a collector?

16:41.299 --> 16:42.641
He was buying as a collector.

16:42.661 --> 16:43.422
He was buying both.

16:45.511 --> 16:51.779
What do you think of people who buy for investment purposes as opposed to— Well, that's a gamble you're taking.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.364
That's a pure gamble you're taking, you know.

16:56.285 --> 17:00.931
I mean, but what do you think of people who do that— I don't—I don't bother with people like that.

17:01.071 --> 17:07.660
If you want to buy for an investment, I say, go down to Wall Street.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.622
Go ahead, do you want to do that?

17:09.642 --> 17:11.164
I don't think there's any difference in people who collect books.

17:11.515 --> 17:33.173
We're talking about the difference between the person who buys, say, a Van Gogh for $40,000 or $50,000 million, the difference between the art collector and the book collector.

17:33.493 --> 17:34.395
There is no debt deal.

17:34.415 --> 17:35.637
You can't.

17:35.657 --> 17:36.679
They're two different things.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.343
Are they two different kinds of collector?

17:40.403 --> 17:42.105
They're two different kinds of collector.

17:42.586 --> 17:44.228
How would you describe the difference?

17:44.248 --> 17:49.816
Well, for instance, I had a customer whose name was Sang, Phil Sang, in Chicago.

17:52.260 --> 17:57.848
He started buying small things, you know, signatures and so on.

17:57.868 --> 18:01.553
Turned out to be one of the great collectors of autographs.

18:04.598 --> 18:06.601
He had a sale that brought over a million.

18:07.562 --> 18:08.303
S-A-N-G?

18:08.536 --> 18:14.382
Yes.

18:14.402 --> 18:18.727
And the point being compared, like, to art, though, the painting?

18:19.447 --> 18:21.590
No, you see, you can't compare that.

18:21.750 --> 18:26.334
I mean, you can't compare a man that buys a picture that wants to hang up on the wall.

18:26.735 --> 18:27.316
It's an ornament.

18:27.696 --> 18:37.446
It's an ornament to a man who wants to buy a letter because he was a great man, you know.

18:39.991 --> 18:41.372
He gave something to the lawyer.

18:41.392 --> 18:43.735
I see what you're saying.

18:44.816 --> 18:50.401
One of the ironies, I think, of the book or manuscript collector is that you buy these things and you really can never touch them.

18:50.521 --> 18:54.024
I mean, you leave, you don't display them, shall we say.

18:54.445 --> 18:54.925
That's right.

18:56.787 --> 19:00.030
And in many cases, you'll find the book collector is very private.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.392
He doesn't even want anybody to know that he owns these things.

19:02.953 --> 19:07.136
Whereas the owner of a great painting, everybody just walks into the house, looks at it.

19:07.176 --> 19:07.737
Looks at it.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.261
Now, how about yourself?

19:10.281 --> 19:11.363
Have you ever been a collector?

19:12.224 --> 19:15.489
I was interested in folklore myself.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.972
I had a little collection, which I sold.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.955
I mean, you know, it was getting beyond me.

19:20.236 --> 19:24.201
I was too busy in the business, and I was traveling all over the world.

19:24.362 --> 19:31.852
I used to go to Europe five, six, seven, eight times a year, ten times a year sometimes.

19:31.872 --> 19:32.473
To buy books?

19:32.874 --> 19:33.074
Yeah.

19:34.156 --> 19:36.499
Did you buy from estates, or you went to auctions?

19:36.519 --> 19:37.200
I went to auctions.

19:38.918 --> 19:40.300
Do you like buying an auction?

19:41.521 --> 19:46.447
I was a very heavy buyer at auction years ago, very heavy.

19:46.467 --> 19:49.790
What kind of instincts do you work with?

19:50.251 --> 19:53.274
Well, it's something that you know.

19:53.354 --> 20:03.186
You have clients and you think that this man ought to be interested in them, so you buy it or buy it for him.

20:03.966 --> 20:08.031
Do you buy often just on speculation with a thought?

20:08.787 --> 20:09.708
That you might have a coin?

20:09.728 --> 20:10.108
Of course you are.

20:10.128 --> 20:10.669
Of course.

20:10.929 --> 20:11.149
Of course.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.671
You've got to use it.

20:12.691 --> 20:12.891
Of course.

20:12.911 --> 20:19.057
I mean, let's say that you were bidding on the Shakespeare's, and Manny wasn't there with you.

20:19.077 --> 20:22.621
I don't know whether I would have gone that high.

20:22.701 --> 20:23.262
I don't know.

20:23.282 --> 20:25.544
I mean, that's a lot of money for the Shakespeare's.

20:25.564 --> 20:26.124
That's a lot of money.

20:26.165 --> 20:28.287
Because the Shakespeare's are as wonderful as they are.

20:28.347 --> 20:29.348
They're not rare books.

20:29.388 --> 20:31.170
There was one a year ago.

20:32.110 --> 20:35.894
It was sold for $600 and some odd thousand dollars.

20:36.675 --> 20:37.596
This very set.

20:38.065 --> 20:39.587
was Crouse had it last.

20:39.687 --> 20:41.310
I called it Crouse.

20:41.330 --> 20:45.937
And they had it listed in their catalog just 15 years ago for $165,000.

20:46.037 --> 20:46.578
There you go.

20:47.419 --> 20:49.362
And the thing went up to $2 million.

20:49.602 --> 20:51.906
You know, I mean, how can you explain things?

20:52.226 --> 20:53.228
It's very difficult.

20:54.710 --> 20:57.675
And yet, how high do you... I don't know.

20:57.995 --> 20:58.456
I don't know.

20:59.217 --> 21:03.263
It all depends how well you're in with your clients.

21:04.778 --> 21:07.943
And it helps that the client's there with you, too, doesn't it?

21:07.963 --> 21:10.787
It helps that the client's there with you, you know.

21:10.807 --> 21:13.250
You answered the question.

21:13.270 --> 21:21.161
But have you ever gone to any of these auctions where you're—they don't—the client doesn't really want the competition to know who he is, who's buying it?

21:21.702 --> 21:22.123
Oh, yes.

21:22.143 --> 21:26.048
Lots of—lots of people don't want their names mentioned.

21:26.068 --> 21:28.091
Nicholas Barker—you know Nicholas Barker?

21:28.151 --> 21:32.217
I did an interview with him a few weeks ago from the British Library.

21:32.237 --> 21:32.878
Yeah.

21:33.145 --> 21:42.276
He feels that you can really tell the climate of the market more by the underbidder than the one who gets the prize.

21:43.918 --> 21:49.044
In other words, we don't know how high Manny would have been willing to go to get those Shakespeare's.

21:49.104 --> 21:52.148
I don't think he would have gone any higher.

21:52.168 --> 21:52.829
He quit, right?

21:52.849 --> 21:53.870
Because he hesitated.

21:53.950 --> 21:55.913
Remember John said, think about it?

21:56.113 --> 21:58.295
I was sitting right there, man.

21:59.096 --> 22:02.140
I was sitting as close to him closer than I'm sitting to you.

22:02.592 --> 22:04.696
And I heard the conversation going on.

22:04.716 --> 22:05.518
What were they saying?

22:06.219 --> 22:07.923
You know, he said, go ahead.

22:08.143 --> 22:09.706
Yeah, but he told them to think about it.

22:09.807 --> 22:13.935
He was ready to... And he put his hand up, you know, and... And that was that.

22:15.879 --> 22:18.444
So in other words, this was it, two men in, and then I'm out.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.067
I wonder who he was bidding against.

22:20.087 --> 22:21.831
That would be nice to know who the competition was.

22:21.851 --> 22:22.733
Well, I don't know.

22:22.753 --> 22:23.875
I think Valerie could tell you.

22:24.108 --> 22:26.991
They don't want to give names.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.252
It was a telephone bidder.

22:28.593 --> 22:30.675
Maybe a telephone bid, I don't know.

22:30.695 --> 22:31.976
Yeah, but Quaritch wasn't in that.

22:32.036 --> 22:33.998
Quaritch was buying pretty much everything else.

22:34.079 --> 22:36.121
He was buying a lot of stuff, Quaritch.

22:36.321 --> 22:41.066
Yeah, he got the Cervantes for, I'm told, for a Spanish collector, is what I heard.

22:41.086 --> 22:44.710
Yeah, you buy for people, you know, like I used to do.

22:44.730 --> 22:51.617
But you see, I'm not so heavy in buying today, because at my age,

22:52.694 --> 22:55.618
I just hang on with a few people.

22:57.320 --> 22:57.420
Yeah.

22:57.981 --> 23:04.030
But I hear the book Grapevine out there that you're still pretty well involved in this.

23:04.110 --> 23:04.550
I'm involved.

23:04.570 --> 23:05.451
Of course I'm involved.

23:05.532 --> 23:06.653
I'm always involved.

23:06.833 --> 23:11.800
I'm involved all the time, and I will always be involved.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.945
I'm told you know where all the great books are, all the great treasures.

23:14.965 --> 23:15.265
That's right.

23:15.325 --> 23:21.874
I know where a lot of the books are, and I know where collections that I've made that would give it away to institutions.

23:22.816 --> 23:27.061
Well, that must be satisfying to some degree.

23:27.943 --> 23:28.503
You know?

23:28.523 --> 23:32.809
Like, for instance, which collections have been given to institutions that you can think of offhand?

23:32.849 --> 23:36.153
Well, a man by the name of Hugh Field gave this whole collection.

23:36.293 --> 23:36.814
Famous, yeah.

23:36.834 --> 23:37.895
Yeah, gave this whole collection.

23:37.915 --> 23:38.876
You know, it's in Kentucky.

23:39.217 --> 23:40.338
That's a famous collection.

23:40.579 --> 23:40.899
Sure.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.020
You built that collection?

23:43.863 --> 23:43.963
Yeah.

23:43.983 --> 23:46.907
These are very famous collections he's mentioning.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.268
I have it in all of them.

23:48.469 --> 23:51.152
Great collection of Charles and Mary Lamb.

23:51.824 --> 23:52.305
Oh, my.

23:52.385 --> 23:53.907
Was that original manuscript style?

23:53.927 --> 23:55.409
That's right.

23:55.429 --> 23:56.191
And where did that go?

23:56.231 --> 23:57.412
That went to Kentucky.

23:57.472 --> 24:00.577
Kentucky.

24:00.597 --> 24:01.639
Yeah.

24:01.659 --> 24:06.927
Do you kind of have mixed emotions when you see it go to an institution, then you know it's never going to be offered again?

24:06.947 --> 24:07.507
Of course.

24:08.108 --> 24:11.614
Because as a dealer, you might like to say, geez, I'd like to have another whack at that.

24:11.934 --> 24:14.938
Well, you may or may not, I mean, of all the things you see.

24:16.301 --> 24:20.667
You see, the market has changed so dramatically, so dramatically.

24:22.604 --> 24:29.054
in the last five years, that sometimes I don't recognize what's going on.

24:29.455 --> 24:30.877
Talk to me a little bit about that.

24:30.917 --> 24:32.439
How has it changed, not just the money?

24:32.580 --> 24:34.583
Are you talking just in terms of the value, or...?

24:34.843 --> 24:38.208
I'm talking about money value, dollar-wise.

24:39.691 --> 24:42.014
But the institutions aren't buying as much.

24:42.255 --> 24:47.683
It's the private collector who's... Well, the private collector has more money than he ever had before.

24:48.001 --> 24:50.224
And the institutions don't have what they used to have.

24:50.324 --> 24:53.910
And the institutions don't have what they used to have.

24:54.130 --> 24:55.953
That's about the nutshell of it, right there.

24:55.973 --> 24:57.155
That's the whole thing, right there.

24:58.276 --> 24:59.458
That's what I wrote for this Sunday.

24:59.498 --> 25:05.787
That's the essence of what I said, is that David Redden feels that we're in a new golden age of book collecting.

25:05.807 --> 25:06.729
Would you agree with that?

25:09.773 --> 25:12.778
Well, yes and no.

25:13.398 --> 25:17.164
Don't forget you don't have as many

25:17.397 --> 25:19.379
Book sales, there weren't years ago.

25:21.222 --> 25:28.490
And the money is freer.

25:29.772 --> 25:30.112
Today?

25:30.393 --> 25:30.693
Yeah.

25:31.374 --> 25:32.575
What do you mean freer, looser?

25:32.976 --> 25:36.740
Looser, I mean, people are willing to throw it around.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.322
People are willing to, that's right.

25:38.883 --> 25:40.325
You think that, I mean, is that correct?

25:40.365 --> 25:41.326
Is that a correct assumption?

25:41.346 --> 25:43.328
That's right.

25:43.348 --> 25:44.890
And you say it amazes you to see it.

25:45.258 --> 25:53.069
It amazes me to see it because being in the business for the many years that I've been in, sometimes it was hard to sell a client, you know.

25:53.089 --> 25:58.276
He's got to figure out where the money is going to come from, you know.

25:58.297 --> 25:59.939
But today, it seems to me.

26:02.863 --> 26:07.129
Do you find, now, my regular job is I'm a book review editor.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.093
I'm the book review editor of the Worcester Telegram in Massachusetts.

26:10.274 --> 26:10.954
Oh.

26:11.055 --> 26:12.096
I review books.

26:12.116 --> 26:14.860
I'm a critic as well as a writer of collecting.

26:15.548 --> 26:23.556
And I find, and the reason I say this is that I find, having done this for 12 years now, that when I get, I feel that I know people.

26:25.238 --> 26:25.718
You're just a baby.

26:25.739 --> 26:26.339
That's a nice name.

26:26.359 --> 26:27.701
You're just an infant.

26:27.721 --> 26:30.864
You're an infant.

26:30.884 --> 26:32.085
You've made my day.

26:32.886 --> 26:37.671
I feel that to know a person is to know their reading habits.

26:38.452 --> 26:39.252
Well, of course.

26:39.292 --> 26:41.915
Do you feel the same way as a book dealer?

26:41.955 --> 26:42.356
That's right.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.678
I mean, that almost, that you can almost,

26:45.367 --> 26:47.810
You consider yourself something of a psychiatrist.

26:48.331 --> 26:50.494
That's perhaps a little too strong.

26:50.654 --> 26:52.517
That's a little bit too strong, you know.

26:52.677 --> 26:53.999
But a confidant, certainly.

26:54.079 --> 26:55.922
That's different, that's different.

26:55.942 --> 27:00.048
You have a window into the person's... See, let me give you an example.

27:01.390 --> 27:03.873
I've got it right here, which I'm working on now.

27:04.734 --> 27:05.115
Wonderful.

27:05.135 --> 27:11.464
There was a man by the name of Littauer.

27:11.484 --> 27:12.906
That name's familiar for some reason.

27:13.627 --> 27:14.428
And he was...

27:15.286 --> 27:26.320
He was a taught riding, horse riding, at a big place in Long Island.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.601
Known all over the world.

27:29.644 --> 27:35.491
You know, his riding, teaching people how to saddle and ride a horse.

27:35.511 --> 27:36.292
Austrian arts.

27:36.693 --> 27:37.153
That's right.

27:39.756 --> 27:43.581
I met him about, oh, I don't know, 30, 40 years ago.

27:44.542 --> 27:45.023
He died.

27:46.117 --> 27:49.303
And you see, here is this collection which I have to appraise.

27:52.969 --> 28:00.582
And he's got books from the

28:18.770 --> 28:21.633
He's got books from the 15th century.

28:22.034 --> 28:26.439
Wow, 15th century.

28:26.459 --> 28:28.381
These are even pre-incunibles, aren't they?

28:28.421 --> 28:29.923
I mean, incunibles.

28:29.943 --> 28:34.088
1632, 1623, 1685, 1619.

28:34.168 --> 28:37.612
Then he goes on.

28:41.196 --> 28:43.359
So this fellow's name is Liddower?

28:43.599 --> 28:43.919
Yeah.

28:43.999 --> 28:44.680
Is he an American?

28:46.122 --> 28:47.123
Or did he say British?

28:47.812 --> 28:51.136
I don't know what he was, but he was a father.

28:53.018 --> 29:05.872
And then he's got the... And then he's got the modern books, you know.

29:07.414 --> 29:09.296
So he really covers the subject.

29:11.899 --> 29:13.521
Yeah.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.203
Now, are you appraising this?

29:15.740 --> 29:16.681
For the estate.

29:16.701 --> 29:20.265
For the estate, which probably intends to put it up for auction, is that it?

29:20.285 --> 29:22.027
No, I don't know what she's going to do.

29:22.147 --> 29:23.729
I spoke to Mr. Liddow.

29:25.311 --> 29:32.179
This is interesting, and I'm not talking about the, and this is not with respect to the Liddowers or anyone specifically.

29:32.219 --> 29:36.143
There's a collection of books that I have to do on the Vietnam War.

29:36.784 --> 29:38.646
That's a very interesting subject now.

29:38.666 --> 29:39.847
See?

29:39.867 --> 29:42.290
See?

29:42.310 --> 29:43.652
Only on the Vietnam War.

29:43.912 --> 29:44.953
How do you appraise these?

29:45.659 --> 29:47.321
When there really isn't a bibliography.

29:47.701 --> 29:59.336
There is a bibliography, but most of these are out of print, and you kind of put a, you know, you get a feeling of what a book is worth, and you put a price on it, and a collection.

29:59.596 --> 30:02.219
You could put a bigger price than an individual book.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.881
Because it's a collection.

30:03.981 --> 30:05.243
Because it's a collection.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.926
Because it's the easy way to get the whole thing fast.

30:09.488 --> 30:13.793
If you've got all of Dickens, all of Dickens is worth more than,

30:14.043 --> 30:16.626
than all of Dickens in individual segments.

30:18.128 --> 30:19.710
It's probably twice, actually.

30:19.750 --> 30:23.095
Isn't that what the figure is, generally, sometimes?

30:23.815 --> 30:25.137
How about taste and fashion?

30:25.938 --> 30:27.500
You say you've seen the market change.

30:27.540 --> 30:29.923
How about taste and fashion in book collections?

30:30.384 --> 30:31.445
Have you seen that change?

30:31.645 --> 30:32.987
Yes, it changes.

30:33.007 --> 30:34.069
Sure, that changes.

30:35.510 --> 30:41.859
At one time, an author, you couldn't sell an author.

30:42.219 --> 30:43.020
Then all of a sudden,

30:43.456 --> 30:48.200
Something happened, and the world runs and tries to buy it.

30:49.802 --> 30:52.384
Well, Melville was like that for the longest time, wasn't he?

30:52.524 --> 30:56.268
Well, I sold Bradley Melville's Bible.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.589
Really?

30:57.609 --> 30:59.971
God, he used.

31:02.653 --> 31:06.016
Melville's Bible.

31:06.036 --> 31:08.479
Coming up at sale, I think.

31:08.639 --> 31:10.761
Now, where did you find Melville's Bible?

31:10.821 --> 31:13.243
I found it in Joliet, Illinois.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.061
And how did you get wind of it?

31:16.362 --> 31:27.937
Well, a customer of mine who was an autograph collector came to his house one night, and there I saw this and some other medical things, and I bought them all, and I sold them to Brazil.

31:27.957 --> 31:29.920
Did he know what he had, the guy?

31:29.940 --> 31:33.504
Oh, sure, sure.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.569
You must have a million stories about extraordinary finds.

31:36.589 --> 31:39.072
Oh, yes, I have a million stories.

31:40.614 --> 31:42.977
I was going to look for a list here.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.873
I suppose this is in another file.

31:47.275 --> 31:50.580
I gave Bradley a list of the library that I bought.

31:51.802 --> 31:54.425
He was sitting where you're sitting.

31:54.445 --> 31:58.451
And he went through it, and he used to mark H-B-N.

31:59.693 --> 32:00.814
He marked it H-B-N.

32:00.834 --> 32:04.900
And he marked it on the edge, H-B-N, H-B-N.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.263
When I brought the library in... When he wants it.

32:07.704 --> 32:07.924
Yes.

32:08.505 --> 32:10.888
When I brought the library in, there were eight or ten

32:11.678 --> 32:15.242
part of the whole group, you know, that had his mark.

32:15.262 --> 32:16.764
And I put him in front of him.

32:17.245 --> 32:21.310
It came to 18,000-something, I don't remember the exact amount.

32:22.171 --> 32:25.535
And he took his wallet out and he wrote a check out.

32:25.816 --> 32:27.838
And they carried him out?

32:28.139 --> 32:29.340
Yeah.

32:29.420 --> 32:30.481
Did he love books?

32:30.522 --> 32:31.082
He loved books.

32:31.102 --> 32:35.828
Did something happen to him when he, I mean, that you could see when he came in contact with a great book?

32:35.848 --> 32:36.309
He loved books.

32:37.670 --> 32:38.952
I guess I'm looking for

32:39.286 --> 32:47.379
some kind of insight into what it is that really transforms a person into, you know, what we call bibliomaniacs.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.422
Do you have any thoughts on that?

32:49.663 --> 32:52.127
I'm not a physician.

32:52.207 --> 32:53.008
I don't know.

32:53.128 --> 32:55.072
I'm not a psychiatrist.

32:55.092 --> 32:59.659
I don't know what can... But motivation, I guess, is what I mean.

32:59.679 --> 33:04.026
You must have some sense as to what motivates people to do it.

33:04.046 --> 33:06.390
Well, it's a thing that...

33:06.961 --> 33:08.544
The love for a thing, you know.

33:08.664 --> 33:12.150
You start with one, then you get two, then you get three, then you get four.

33:12.610 --> 33:17.198
And you say, well, I'll add to it to see myself.

33:17.218 --> 33:20.504
Yeah, but for instance, now you're talking about the equestrian collection.

33:21.045 --> 33:23.168
Here's the wife having it appraised.

33:23.188 --> 33:23.589
Yes.

33:23.609 --> 33:26.674
She, I would imagine, didn't share the same enthusiasm.

33:26.774 --> 33:27.095
No.

33:27.115 --> 33:28.858
For the subject as the husband did.

33:28.898 --> 33:29.880
Of course not.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.382
What drove him...

33:31.717 --> 33:41.290
Well, that was his profession, his occupation, but Brantley certainly wasn't a bird, he wasn't an ornithological.

33:42.171 --> 33:46.857
He wasn't a bird specialist, yet he loved books about birds, you know, finest collection.

33:46.898 --> 33:49.221
Well, he started with reading W.H.

33:50.522 --> 34:00.576
Hudson, you know, as a naturalist, and he pulled out a book, and we started, and it just went on and on and on.

34:00.944 --> 34:05.972
There'll never be another collection like it.

34:06.132 --> 34:06.914
That is a shame.

34:07.394 --> 34:17.110
And I understand that he actually, there was something in the will that, that it wasn't clear, but he did give the trust the option to sell it as a unit.

34:17.130 --> 34:18.713
I have a copy of his will here.

34:19.213 --> 34:19.414
Yeah?

34:19.694 --> 34:24.702
But yes, it's all going to the trust of the Bessemer Trust.

34:24.722 --> 34:25.604
The Bessemer Trust.

34:25.624 --> 34:25.804
Yeah.

34:25.835 --> 34:30.139
And I guess their position is, their responsibility is to maximize the estate.

34:30.319 --> 34:33.762
And to take care of the family, don't forget.

34:33.782 --> 34:36.885
But of course, the family's not bad at all.

34:36.905 --> 34:39.267
No, of course not.

34:39.287 --> 34:43.171
I mean, it's not like they need the proceeds of that library for their livelihood.

34:43.811 --> 34:43.971
Ms.

34:43.991 --> 34:45.373
Bessemer was Bessemer Steele.

34:49.737 --> 34:52.399
He has two children with a prison.

34:52.679 --> 34:52.879
Right.

34:54.461 --> 34:55.842
Alice and Bradley.

34:56.193 --> 34:58.455
junior.

34:58.475 --> 35:01.939
And he has one daughter left from the first junior.

35:07.685 --> 35:08.085
How about yourself?

35:08.105 --> 35:08.846
Do you love books?

35:09.086 --> 35:09.907
I do.

35:10.027 --> 35:11.408
I've been with books all my life.

35:11.629 --> 35:13.030
I think books all the time.

35:13.711 --> 35:17.775
But I mean, you love them beyond the fact that it's your profession, that it's just something that you pick up.

35:17.795 --> 35:20.918
I wonder if you could tell me what a book means to you.

35:21.590 --> 35:28.697
I do take the same pride, say, in building Bradley Martin's collection as Bradley Martin took in building it and owning it.

35:29.057 --> 35:31.400
That's right.

35:31.540 --> 35:32.120
Same way.

35:32.180 --> 35:33.542
I mean, that's a fair statement?

35:33.562 --> 35:36.244
That's a fair statement.

35:36.264 --> 35:44.913
So when you got him the better Audubon, you felt good, not only because he got a better Audubon, but you felt I got a better Audubon.

35:45.033 --> 35:46.214
That's right.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.175
Am I in the right?

35:47.495 --> 35:50.078
I wouldn't let him buy the other one.

35:50.362 --> 35:56.209
One of the responsibilities that you acquire, I guess, as a dealer over the... You know, you've got to know your customer.

35:56.609 --> 35:56.709
Yeah.

35:56.729 --> 36:01.635
And you've got to know how much money he's got to afford to go.

36:01.655 --> 36:04.318
I guess, you know, integrity is everything.

36:04.639 --> 36:05.079
Of course.

36:05.480 --> 36:12.148
You know, you wouldn't... I don't know, your financial secretary, but would you go out and buy something for $100,000?

36:14.070 --> 36:17.434
I certainly don't have the wherewithal to do that, but... All right, there you go.

36:17.554 --> 36:19.356
But you didn't like to know that.

36:20.939 --> 36:36.296
But I think what we're saying is these people came to trust you, not only for your knowledge of books, but for the fact that you were going to give them a very honest evaluation of what it was worth.

36:36.436 --> 36:47.668
I mean, you hear it said that certain collectors single-handedly, because of their indiscriminate buying, were responsible for the market going crazy.

36:47.688 --> 36:49.090
Of course.

36:49.441 --> 36:56.489
Because a dealer will say, hey, there's a guy in New York who buys modern first American books.

36:56.509 --> 36:58.451
And he'll pay anything for it.

36:58.932 --> 37:03.037
So all of a sudden, they'll go out and they'll buy a Faulkner that maybe ought to go for $2,500.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.780
And they put $5,000, $6,000 on it.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.723
I'm just talking in generalities about it.

37:08.823 --> 37:10.805
Talk about Faulkner.

37:11.366 --> 37:13.448
I had a lady write me a letter.

37:13.468 --> 37:16.091
She said she's got a copy of the marble form.

37:16.772 --> 37:19.195
That was Faulkner's first book.

37:20.204 --> 37:26.330
And I wrote back and I said, yes, I'd be interested in it.

37:27.832 --> 37:38.403
She said, how much would you pay, you know, and I said, I told her, I called her on the phone after I'd written it, and I said, oh, I'd like to see it.

37:38.603 --> 37:43.368
It's all right, I'll give you $1,000 worth, you know, just like that.

37:43.388 --> 37:45.030
So she came clear off of it.

37:47.322 --> 37:55.553
And out of her bag, she sat down, and out of her bag she pulled this thing out, and there was a copy in the dust jacket.

37:58.037 --> 38:04.466
So I wrote her a check right away, and she said, would you buy another one?

38:04.486 --> 38:08.892
And she pulled them out.

38:08.912 --> 38:09.833
Oh, my gosh.

38:09.973 --> 38:10.053
Wow.

38:10.093 --> 38:11.115
She had two of them?

38:11.135 --> 38:16.062
So I said to her, I said, well, here's the story she told me.

38:16.662 --> 38:17.143
She said,

38:17.478 --> 38:21.482
Faulkner lived in her mother's house in the South.

38:21.502 --> 38:21.582
Wow.

38:21.822 --> 38:23.463
And when this book was published.

38:23.804 --> 38:24.464
What a great story.

38:24.484 --> 38:28.808
You know, he gave his, I won his grandmother one, but this one won it.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.310
There's only 70 copies of this book accounted for.

38:31.450 --> 38:34.053
And we're talking about a book that's exceedingly skit.

38:34.253 --> 38:36.515
I just saw it.

38:36.535 --> 38:37.376
I just saw it.

38:37.436 --> 38:40.499
The Christie sale that you went to a couple weeks ago, they had a marble farm.

38:40.699 --> 38:41.059
Yeah.

38:41.079 --> 38:43.181
And I think they got a pretty good price for it.

38:43.201 --> 38:45.443
I think it was $13,000, $14,000, I think.

38:46.452 --> 38:51.359
So you see when things happen, you see how she pulled another one, you know?

38:51.379 --> 38:54.885
It was like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

38:54.905 --> 38:56.507
How long ago was this, roughly?

38:56.527 --> 39:01.615
Oh, this must be 12 years ago, 15 years ago.

39:01.675 --> 39:08.365
And you obviously had clients immediately who would... Oh, yes, I sold them both immediately for the same day as a matter of fact.

39:08.385 --> 39:09.286
Really?

39:09.306 --> 39:15.295
I collect Faulkner, and obviously the marble fawn is one... I remember Joyce when you couldn't give Joyce away.

39:16.490 --> 39:28.865
I remember buying 135 letters of Joyce for a paper guy, a dealer bought them, and he said to me one day, he said, would you want to buy a Joyce collection?

39:28.885 --> 39:30.447
I said, how much is it?

39:30.628 --> 39:31.609
He said, $1,100.

39:31.649 --> 39:35.774
I said, I'll buy it.

39:35.794 --> 39:38.437
So I sold it to a customer of mine.

39:39.999 --> 39:44.725
He eventually sold it to Southern Illinois.

39:45.953 --> 39:46.814
University.

39:47.075 --> 39:48.857
They have a pretty good choice collection.

39:48.877 --> 39:51.320
What do you tell it to them for?

39:52.041 --> 39:53.043
I think 50,000.

39:53.343 --> 39:53.744
Not bad.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.930
Today would bring millions.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.652
Four or five times.

39:59.712 --> 40:01.374
I mean, you can't... You can't judge.

40:01.535 --> 40:02.957
You can't look back.

40:03.057 --> 40:04.178
You've got to look forward.

40:04.198 --> 40:07.323
Don't look back, because if you look back, you'll be a sorrowful man.

40:08.424 --> 40:13.311
Well, with that in mind, though, you must have some stories about ones that got away, too.

40:14.371 --> 40:14.692
The one?

40:14.932 --> 40:19.119
You must have some stories about opportunities that you missed.

40:19.139 --> 40:19.299
Oh!

40:20.221 --> 40:21.102
Oh!

40:21.122 --> 40:22.905
Some that must still hurt a little bit, too.

40:23.627 --> 40:25.089
Oh, I can't get to tell you.

40:25.530 --> 40:26.612
Well, can you tell me?

40:26.652 --> 40:28.996
Well, I mean, what can I tell you?

40:29.016 --> 40:38.612
For instance, I sold Bradley the copy of Washington's copy of The Federalist, which is just Washington.

40:38.632 --> 40:38.933
That's okay.

40:38.953 --> 40:39.894
You don't have to look at it.

40:39.934 --> 40:40.395
No, no, no.

40:48.998 --> 40:50.279
How are we doing?

40:50.299 --> 40:51.781
Good.

40:51.801 --> 40:52.421
Oh, here it is.

40:52.622 --> 40:54.504
This is it here?

40:55.004 --> 40:59.108
Here it is in the January 1990 South of the newsletter.

41:00.290 --> 41:01.311
You can take this with you.

41:01.791 --> 41:01.911
Okay.

41:01.931 --> 41:03.593
Well, they're saying $400,000.

41:03.793 --> 41:05.014
I have another copy.

41:06.256 --> 41:07.817
It'll probably go for more than that, right?

41:08.298 --> 41:08.758
I don't know.

41:08.778 --> 41:09.619
That's a question.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.421
But you sold that to Bradley.

41:11.461 --> 41:11.901
Yes.

41:11.921 --> 41:13.503
And it's signed by George Washington.

41:13.963 --> 41:14.224
Yes.

41:14.344 --> 41:17.487
Presented by Madison Brown.

41:18.327 --> 41:19.308
Where did you find that?

41:20.109 --> 41:21.391
Cape of the Hearst estate.

41:26.477 --> 41:28.799
How did you manage to get the inside?

41:28.899 --> 41:30.161
I don't know how.

41:30.341 --> 41:32.123
How about Rosenbach?

41:32.143 --> 41:33.084
Did you know Rosenbach?

41:33.104 --> 41:34.065
Oh, I knew him very well.

41:36.628 --> 41:40.012
I told him one day, I was sitting up with him in his house, and I sat there.

41:40.052 --> 41:41.554
Was he down in Philadelphia or here?

41:41.614 --> 41:41.895
No, here.

41:41.915 --> 41:43.517
I was in Philadelphia many times.

41:43.637 --> 41:48.182
I said to him one day, I said, you should have died 10 years ago.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.302
So they looked at me.

41:53.322 --> 41:54.963
I said, you would have died a champion.

41:54.983 --> 42:10.796
You see, when these foreign dealers came over to America during the Hitler regime, a lot of them were steeped in bibliography, and they knew the business very well.

42:10.936 --> 42:12.197
They were driven out by Hitler.

42:12.218 --> 42:13.038
They were driven out.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.040
There's been some lectures on this, too.

42:15.060 --> 42:15.460
Sure, of course.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.321
At Columbia.

42:16.341 --> 42:18.363
Yeah, go ahead.

42:18.563 --> 42:21.105
And naturally, they...

42:22.469 --> 42:28.716
They took over, because they were steeped in this thing, you know.

42:28.816 --> 42:29.877
In bibliography.

42:29.897 --> 42:30.658
In bibliography.

42:31.579 --> 42:32.920
So what did Rosenbach say?

42:32.940 --> 42:33.701
Oh, he laughed.

42:33.741 --> 42:34.402
But he wasn't?

42:34.422 --> 42:35.823
You said you don't think he knew?

42:35.843 --> 42:36.444
He knew.

42:36.544 --> 42:38.486
He was very, very, very interested.

42:38.667 --> 42:38.827
He knew.

42:39.487 --> 42:41.510
But this is what I told him.

42:41.790 --> 42:45.194
Just like that, I was talking to him, and this is what I told him.

42:45.214 --> 42:46.675
I said, you should die, can you?

42:46.695 --> 42:49.198
You've died a champion.

42:49.218 --> 42:50.259
This was during the war.

42:50.499 --> 42:51.160
Yeah.

42:52.017 --> 42:54.640
Because he died, I think, around the 50s sometime.

42:55.862 --> 42:57.504
He was a great collector, of course.

42:57.524 --> 42:58.906
Oh, yeah.

42:58.926 --> 43:01.209
You know, he kept... Well, how do you feel about that?

43:01.229 --> 43:03.612
Now, here's a guy who kept a lot of the best things for himself.

43:03.632 --> 43:17.611
I mean, it's hard to... Well, he was very much interested in it, and he collected certain things that he liked.

43:19.012 --> 43:20.995
It's all there in Philadelphia.

43:21.245 --> 43:22.768
It's a little museum.

43:22.908 --> 43:27.516
It's beautiful.

43:27.557 --> 43:28.358
I've been there.

43:28.378 --> 43:28.458
Yes.

43:29.320 --> 43:34.209
I think eventually it will go to the Philadelphia Library.

43:34.429 --> 43:35.010
Do you think so?

43:35.571 --> 43:36.252
Yeah.

43:36.513 --> 43:39.278
I thought they had their own little trusteeship down there.

43:39.298 --> 43:40.941
Well, they have a little trusteeship,

43:41.360 --> 43:43.422
I think that's my opinion.

43:43.482 --> 43:45.844
Well, I sure hope they keep it intact just the way it is.

43:45.864 --> 43:48.547
Well, it'll be intact, but I think it'll go over to me.

43:48.567 --> 43:49.968
Because the house is wonderful.

43:50.309 --> 43:50.629
Oh, yeah.

43:50.649 --> 43:51.850
And his brother speaks.

43:51.870 --> 43:54.353
The one on Delancey Street?

43:54.373 --> 43:54.473
Yeah.

43:54.713 --> 43:56.515
I stayed at that house many a night.

43:56.555 --> 43:56.895
Really?

43:56.955 --> 43:57.035
Yes.

43:57.055 --> 44:00.058
This is where we lived, and it's downtown.

44:00.599 --> 44:04.222
It's like the Philadelphia version of Beacon Hill.

44:05.003 --> 44:05.664
I don't know what they call it.

44:05.684 --> 44:05.924
I'll try it.

44:05.944 --> 44:09.047
And it's because we're, you know, my wife knows Boston better than she knows.

44:09.067 --> 44:09.848
Oh, you're from Boston?

44:10.115 --> 44:12.706
Well, we're from Massachusetts, but Worcester.

44:13.168 --> 44:17.465
Well, I helped the American Jewish Historical Society.

44:18.731 --> 44:19.112
You did?

44:20.037 --> 44:22.080
I've got an interesting question about that.

44:22.260 --> 44:25.545
That manuscript that they sold, that they got from Wessing Rosenwald.

44:25.625 --> 44:27.728
Yeah, they got $40,000.

44:27.888 --> 44:28.969
Well, more than that, $176,000.

44:28.989 --> 44:30.371
$170,000.

44:30.712 --> 44:30.912
Yeah.

44:30.952 --> 44:32.955
They sold it at Christmas, at the 70s.

44:32.975 --> 44:33.355
Right.

44:33.375 --> 44:35.779
And then I guess it finally, it found its way to... The Jewish regime.

44:35.799 --> 44:36.359
Yeah, I agree with you.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.262
But what do you think about that?

44:38.402 --> 44:40.065
Now, this is a case with jumping around.

44:40.085 --> 44:40.485
I don't know.

44:40.705 --> 44:41.607
I question that.

44:41.687 --> 44:43.109
I spoke to Bernie Wachs.

44:43.249 --> 44:46.293
You know, I was with them for so many years.

44:46.393 --> 44:49.037
I'm on the board, as a matter of fact.

44:49.057 --> 44:49.858
In...

44:50.210 --> 44:51.471
Really?

44:51.491 --> 44:52.433
You're on the board up there.

44:52.693 --> 44:54.335
John.

44:54.355 --> 44:56.177
I mean, I guess they needed the money, certainly.

44:56.417 --> 45:04.907
They said that they needed the money, but they accepted the thing from Rosenwald with the understanding that they would keep it forever.

45:05.908 --> 45:08.091
He bought it to prevent the Nazis from getting it.

45:08.211 --> 45:08.551
That's right.

45:09.212 --> 45:15.359
In fact, he said in his memoirs, it's the only time he ever told Rosenbach, price is no object.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.180
That's right.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.341
Whether that's true or not.

45:17.622 --> 45:17.922
That's true.

45:17.942 --> 45:19.023
It makes for a nice story.

45:19.103 --> 45:19.744
No, that's true.

45:19.994 --> 45:34.310
You know, I was, when Rosenbach's grandson got married, I was invited to the wedding in Chicago, in Chenoweth.

45:37.894 --> 45:41.158
And Lessing and I were sitting at a little table.

45:41.178 --> 45:47.385
We were discussing books while this whole ceremony was going.

45:47.888 --> 45:48.609
He was quite cool.

45:48.629 --> 45:49.610
He was very interested.

45:49.670 --> 45:56.496
Another man that had a great letter that was sold to Sotheby's was that famous Jefferson letter.

45:56.716 --> 45:57.197
Oh, yes.

45:58.778 --> 46:04.463
Now, that came from Pittsburgh.

46:04.484 --> 46:06.786
I saw it hanging in his house at the time.

46:07.206 --> 46:08.427
You were talking about Lessing now.

46:08.687 --> 46:10.869
No, not Lessing, no.

46:10.889 --> 46:14.713
It was, I'll give you his name in a minute, it was hanging in his house.

46:14.733 --> 46:16.815
When he died, she put it up and off.

46:17.825 --> 46:19.828
And Jesselson bought it.

46:19.848 --> 46:20.409
Jesselson.

46:21.371 --> 46:22.352
Very wealthy man.

46:24.396 --> 46:25.778
I think he gave it to Yoshida.

46:27.100 --> 46:27.681
I think so.

46:27.841 --> 46:28.823
I'm not sure.

46:28.843 --> 46:31.347
But I think that's where it is.

46:31.367 --> 46:39.801
See, I'm really interested in that particular story about Rosenwald and that anecdote about saying price is no object.

46:39.821 --> 46:43.427
The essence of this story is he wanted to buy something which he hated.

46:44.099 --> 46:50.326
Because this thing is a famous document that justifies the persecution of Jews.

46:50.527 --> 46:52.789
It's a viciously anti-Semitic document.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.672
He did not want it to go.

46:54.692 --> 47:01.220
And in fact, the underbidders were the Nazis, and they made a big stink about they wanted to open the bidding again.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.122
And he said, no, no, it's mine.

47:03.442 --> 47:06.987
And he thought he hated it so much, he didn't put it in his own collection.

47:07.127 --> 47:07.407
No.

47:07.606 --> 47:08.487
No, he gave it away.

47:08.627 --> 47:12.813
He gave it to the Jewish society, and the understanding was it stays here.

47:13.234 --> 47:19.562
We never want this thing to get in the wrong hands, but they needed the money 50 years later, and they sold it.

47:20.083 --> 47:22.286
So this is why I'm questioning the propriety.

47:22.626 --> 47:24.409
Maybe they should have offered it back to the estate.

47:24.429 --> 47:27.493
I don't know what contact they had between each other.

47:27.913 --> 47:29.896
You see, that's my interest in it.

47:29.936 --> 47:32.940
I don't know what contact they had between each other.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.142
But how do you feel about that?

47:35.183 --> 47:37.326
I feel it all depends what they told them.

47:38.639 --> 47:44.245
If they told them that they're going to keep it, you know, then they should have kept it.

47:44.265 --> 47:44.366
Yeah.

47:44.386 --> 47:49.071
Fortunately, it is a yeshiva now, and so it is where, and a place where it should be.

47:49.371 --> 47:50.332
That's right.

47:50.352 --> 47:54.577
You know, I mean, that's all you need is for somebody like Gaddafi to get a thing like this.

47:54.637 --> 47:57.300
I mean, it's, these things replicate themselves, you know.

47:58.141 --> 48:05.710
And, you know, so this is, who could, what I would hope in my book, where there's a young kid up in the,

48:06.280 --> 48:08.923
Amherst, Massachusetts, by the name of Aaron Lasky.

48:08.963 --> 48:09.744
You ever heard of him?

48:10.365 --> 48:10.845
He's a kid.

48:10.865 --> 48:11.666
He's in his 30s.

48:12.107 --> 48:18.695
He just got a MacArthur Fellowship, and he started this Yiddish library.

48:19.736 --> 48:23.881
They say he's put together the finest collection of Yiddish and Hebrew things anywhere.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.243
Well, the best collection is YIVO.

48:26.124 --> 48:28.246
How do you spell that?

48:28.266 --> 48:29.227
YIVO is what?

48:29.247 --> 48:29.928
YIVO, YIVO.

48:30.249 --> 48:32.271
Here on New York City.

48:34.968 --> 48:36.951
Do they collect Holocaust things, too?

48:36.971 --> 48:37.071
Sure.

48:37.171 --> 48:38.493
Yeah.

48:38.713 --> 48:40.475
You know who else has a great collection?

48:41.056 --> 48:42.078
The Beck Institute.

48:42.518 --> 48:43.319
Beck.

48:43.339 --> 48:46.263
Leo Beck.

48:46.403 --> 48:48.787
Of what, of Yiddish things or Holocaust things?

48:48.827 --> 48:49.287
Holocaust things.

48:49.708 --> 48:51.530
This is an interesting question, you see.

48:51.931 --> 48:53.994
Who collects the horrible things?

48:54.054 --> 48:54.895
They have them.

48:55.235 --> 48:56.397
Leo Beck Institute.

48:56.577 --> 48:57.058
Okay.

48:57.278 --> 48:59.541
I mean, I think that's a very—

49:00.787 --> 49:03.531
Don't you think that's a very interesting area of collecting?

49:03.551 --> 49:05.273
Not because you like the stuff.

49:05.293 --> 49:06.575
You hate the stuff.

49:06.595 --> 49:08.257
But somebody has to preserve it.

49:08.357 --> 49:09.859
That's right.

49:09.879 --> 49:16.408
And Yibo... Yibo is on Fifth Avenue and 86th Street, right on the corner.

49:17.669 --> 49:18.270
That's Yiddish.

49:18.891 --> 49:19.191
Yiddish.

49:20.213 --> 49:20.413
Uh-huh.

49:20.433 --> 49:22.816
Okay.

49:22.836 --> 49:24.098
Leo Beck is not Yiddish.

49:24.919 --> 49:25.780
No, that's Holocaust.

49:26.080 --> 49:27.422
That's Holocaust material.

49:27.622 --> 49:29.545
And...

49:30.048 --> 49:36.338
general material, but Jewish, Yiddish, is Hebrew.

49:36.358 --> 49:37.139
Okay.

49:37.159 --> 49:39.343
This is an interesting area for me to pursue.

49:39.543 --> 49:43.870
See, I'm not just talking about collecting and how you collect and how you tell a person's vision.

49:44.190 --> 49:44.731
That's silly.

49:44.851 --> 49:46.874
You can learn that anywhere.

49:46.894 --> 49:50.520
I'm trying to talk about the spirit, and I think in this country,

49:51.378 --> 49:57.367
A thesis can be made that the book collector is responsible for the preservation of scholarship, of human thought.

49:57.467 --> 49:59.610
You've got guys like Morgan, who set up the library.

49:59.730 --> 50:00.331
That's right.

50:00.351 --> 50:02.514
You've got guys like Folger, the Shakespeare Library.

50:02.875 --> 50:04.337
Huntington, the Huntington Library.

50:04.377 --> 50:05.739
Newbury, the Newbury Library.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.764
You know, the Scheider Library down at Princeton.

50:09.084 --> 50:10.006
Well, I don't know.

50:10.026 --> 50:10.907
That's a family library.

50:10.927 --> 50:12.109
It's a family library.

50:12.149 --> 50:13.150
He's still alive.

50:13.711 --> 50:14.873
Scheider is still alive.

50:14.893 --> 50:18.078
And I'm told that his daughter is now interested in the collection.

50:18.098 --> 50:18.398
Right.

50:18.496 --> 50:18.937
Right.

50:18.957 --> 50:20.639
Have you ever had any dealings with them?

50:20.999 --> 50:24.443
Yes, I sold them things many, many years ago.

50:24.463 --> 50:25.805
They've got a Gutenberg Bible.

50:26.426 --> 50:26.846
Yes, I know.

50:26.966 --> 50:28.689
One of the very few privately owned.

50:28.769 --> 50:35.177
I had a customer who was the president of Bank of Savings in New York.

50:38.761 --> 50:44.648
His name was DeCorsi Dales, F-A-L-E-S.

50:44.668 --> 50:46.551
He loved books.

50:46.571 --> 50:47.592
There was a man that

50:48.517 --> 50:51.161
He was a banker, president of the bank.

50:53.224 --> 50:59.274
And what I tell you now is not for publication.

50:59.294 --> 51:00.015
I'll shut it off, okay?

51:01.177 --> 51:02.259
I have it on the tape.

51:02.279 --> 51:03.821
May you say that again, please?

51:04.803 --> 51:07.307
I won't use his name, but it's an instance.

51:08.088 --> 51:13.116
It's either you go or the books go.

51:13.136 --> 51:13.917
You can understand.

51:15.297 --> 51:19.082
The place was literally, the world was splitting, you know.

51:20.904 --> 51:21.565
So what happened?

51:22.346 --> 51:29.575
And he came to me and he said he'd like to put his library somewhere, you know, his room somewhere.

51:30.937 --> 51:37.145
So I, so I thought for a while, and I tried.

51:38.367 --> 51:41.391
And, you know, nobody wanted to get in the room.

51:41.411 --> 51:43.313
I mean, you know, a library has

51:43.664 --> 51:46.286
How many volumes approximately would you say we're talking about?

51:46.306 --> 51:46.606
Oh, a thousand.

51:46.627 --> 51:47.908
A thousand.

51:47.928 --> 51:48.648
Like more than 25,000?

51:48.788 --> 51:49.249
Yeah.

51:49.269 --> 51:54.853
And I finally went to NYU.

51:55.014 --> 51:56.595
I had some friends at NYU.

51:58.857 --> 52:07.104
And I managed to get to the president.

52:07.124 --> 52:13.249
And I went in, had an interview, I had an appointment with him, came with the president.

52:13.567 --> 52:17.371
And I told him my story, like I'm telling it to you.

52:17.391 --> 52:24.099
He was a man that loved books, autographs, and he would like to establish it somewhere.

52:24.119 --> 52:26.662
And the quality was excellent.

52:26.762 --> 52:28.864
Excellent.

52:29.645 --> 52:38.915
And he thought for a while and he said, well, I think we could work it out.

52:38.955 --> 52:42.139
Talk to my man who's in charge of it.

52:43.267 --> 53:12.160
rooms or some of them so they gave us three rooms on fifth avenue and eighth street nyu did nyu and we started there and then we moved it into the then we rented a floor on 10th street big floor and we had a full librarian wow we had uh and and this man had became nyu one of the great

53:12.730 --> 53:18.059
collections of books and autographs, thousands of letters, thousands of letters.

53:18.079 --> 53:19.843
Mainly because his wife gave him an ultimatum.

53:22.868 --> 53:26.875
The other one was... I'm just going to switch this on the other side before you continue.
