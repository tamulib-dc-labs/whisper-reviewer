At $150,000, near the bank, $150,000 at $150,000.

34:32.392 --> 34:35.035
Any more than $150,000 is near the bank.

34:35.015 --> 34:37.297

35:13.565 --> 35:14.628
At the back, $750.

35:14.649 --> 35:17.779

36:59.130 --> 37:04.235

The first is that the finding was finished.

37:08.830 --> 37:24.981
on 31st July 1913, and also, as of yesterday, I feel confident to announce that this was an atmosphere, it was a few more of the same.

37:25.442 --> 37:27.987
It has a few more of the problems, a lot of other selections.

37:28.709 --> 37:58.699
$30,000 of this, $30,000, $30,000, $30,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, $45,000, $45,000, $50,000, $55,000, $60,000, $65,000, $70,000, that's $70,000, any more than $70,000 and $70,000.

40:02.508 --> 40:07.515
I have a tie bid of $15,000.

40:07.735 --> 40:11.520
In this tie, $15,000 will break the tie.

40:11.540 --> 40:13.263
$15,000 would be a $15,000.

40:13.283 --> 40:13.864
$15,000.

40:13.884 --> 40:20.994
