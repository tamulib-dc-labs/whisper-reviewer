WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:13.244
The Old Main has a kind of a well.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.627
The building is a loading dock area.

00:15.647 --> 00:28.384
And there was a place called the Discard Room, a small place where they took the books and they had them, when they were in high discard mode,

00:28.837 --> 00:29.758
This is how they did it.

00:29.818 --> 00:33.443
They had an elaborate set of instructions that you bundled them up like this.

00:33.984 --> 00:36.948
Now, did you selectively take these?

00:37.069 --> 00:41.435
No, this just happened to be left one other time when I went in the old main building.

00:41.795 --> 00:47.203
This one was just on a shelf, so I wanted to... And it was bound like that at that point?

00:47.603 --> 00:52.951
Yeah, this is just the way they're drawn North Beach.

00:52.971 --> 00:53.852
So this is a branch.

00:53.872 --> 00:55.975
The branches all went through...

00:56.478 --> 01:04.070
kind of a heavy weeding thing in order to make room for this surge of crop e-books.

01:04.531 --> 01:14.706
And there's nothing wrong with that, except that it was poorly coordinated in that they did not check whether that was the last copy of a given book in the system.

01:14.727 --> 01:18.272
And some of the branches have nice old books that just went down.

01:18.292 --> 01:20.015
You can't tell me these books weren't used, either.

01:20.576 --> 01:21.617
Oh, well, yeah.

01:21.657 --> 01:23.380
These don't trouble me.

01:23.731 --> 01:26.634
Really, because they're Duke.

01:26.714 --> 01:35.084
I mean, you know, Are You My Mother is not going to break my heart if that goes to a landfill, right?

01:35.264 --> 01:38.648
It's stupid for it to go to a landfill, since there are obviously places for it to go.

01:40.029 --> 01:47.578
But the things that bothered me, now obviously I don't have any books that went to landfills because they're, you know, under tons of dirt.

01:47.598 --> 01:53.164
But when I went to the discard room, they'd already had the bad press.

01:53.363 --> 02:12.452
So, the stuff that was there then was being, some of it I think was still being, I think they would read through it, and some was being discarded, some was going to landfill, and some was going to the big book giveaways.

02:12.938 --> 02:16.685
I just went through and randomly picked out a bunch of stuff.

02:17.066 --> 02:19.109
Book of Natural Wonders by Haynes?

02:19.270 --> 02:20.512
I have a list of this, by the way.

02:20.612 --> 02:21.153
Oh, you do?

02:21.173 --> 02:21.273
Okay.

02:21.293 --> 02:35.740
Because in that first speech, I said, what I did when I was giving the speech was I just walked on stage with a bunch of books, and I just said, you know, there's Leibniz's Logical Papers, an Oxford book.

02:35.973 --> 02:38.075
Do you mind if I take a couple of pictures of you?

02:38.095 --> 02:45.344
Do you have any problems with that?

02:45.784 --> 02:53.413
That speech, by the way, is considered the defining moment.

02:53.433 --> 02:54.053
You know that, right?

02:55.155 --> 02:57.077
Well, it was the defining moment for me.

02:58.138 --> 03:05.406
I mean, I think it may have helped interest some other people in the problems that were already there.

03:06.247 --> 03:08.089
I think it galvanized people.

03:08.109 --> 03:17.979
It actually brought people into the... But it was a shocking and disgraceful story.

03:29.811 --> 03:30.392
You can talk.

03:30.472 --> 03:32.214
I'm just... Okay, yeah.

03:32.234 --> 03:35.157
So what had happened when I was in the discard room,

03:35.440 --> 03:46.759
They've just gone through the natural history, the bird section, and ethics, and geography.

03:47.681 --> 03:51.027
Because what happens when you weed, you can't weed the whole library at once.

03:52.028 --> 03:56.736
Don't worry about my pictures.

03:56.777 --> 04:01.144
So they weeded one section at a time, which makes sense.

04:02.052 --> 04:13.343
But the criterion they were using for reading was a numerical assignment of a kind of priority value or something assigned to each component of the collection.

04:13.363 --> 04:21.812
And things like ethics were assigned a two, which was a low on a scale of one to six, a low priority level.

04:22.292 --> 04:30.220
And so the librarians who were going through doing the reading, in order to comply with the administration,

04:30.908 --> 04:37.474
were reading things that shouldn't have been drawn out.

04:38.055 --> 04:46.142
So I got this whole box of stuff, and I guess it's a couple of boxes, and just walked out with it, because there was nobody there.

04:46.342 --> 04:47.924
I just walked into the well of the building.

04:47.944 --> 04:49.145
The door was unlocked.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.426
I knew it was the discard room.

04:51.067 --> 04:55.511
It says discard room on it, and it says, you know, pile of discards only this high.

04:55.531 --> 04:57.593
It's about five feet high.

04:57.613 --> 05:00.055
It says, no higher than this, pile of discards.

05:00.220 --> 05:08.909
During the height of this madness, the room was, from time to time, full.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.473
It was full of books.

05:12.493 --> 05:16.718
It was really an insane thing.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.921
Look at this, homing with the birds.

05:20.261 --> 05:21.763
Right.

05:21.783 --> 05:29.451
Now, this is a book that's the last copy of the

05:29.785 --> 05:31.427
at the SFPL.

05:31.647 --> 05:35.451
It's a library binding, which at one point, at least, it got a lot of use.

05:35.911 --> 05:36.572
Clearly, yeah.

05:36.832 --> 05:37.953
And we're not talking about it.

05:37.973 --> 05:41.316
Even this one has gotten some use.

05:41.416 --> 05:47.242
Jean Stratton Porter is kind of an interesting person.

05:47.282 --> 05:49.624
What else did she wrote?

05:49.665 --> 05:51.927
Jean, S-T-R-E-T-T-O-N dash P-O-R-T.

05:51.987 --> 05:52.707
You wrote about this.

05:52.788 --> 05:53.869
You mentioned this book, right?

05:53.889 --> 05:54.089
Yeah.

05:54.169 --> 05:57.312
I think so, yeah.

05:58.861 --> 06:01.852
The Girl of the Limber Lost, I think, or something?

06:01.872 --> 06:05.203
Anyway, you know, there was a PBS, made into a PBS thing.

06:05.244 --> 06:08.154
She's a children's book writer, I think.

06:08.696 --> 06:10.221
Yeah.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.533
I'm not particularly interested in bird books.

06:13.613 --> 06:18.380
It just happened that that day there were a lot of bird books, so I ended up talking about bird books.

06:18.580 --> 06:23.366
But the funny thing was then the administration said, oh, well, he's got to be an important about bird books.

06:23.386 --> 06:24.488
Yeah, this book's been used.

06:24.548 --> 06:25.329
This book's been used.

06:25.429 --> 06:27.412
Here's a nice one, The Way to Study Birds.

06:27.772 --> 06:28.553
Okay, look at that.

06:28.573 --> 06:29.454
Is that a lithograph?

06:29.474 --> 06:30.035
Can I take a look?

06:30.055 --> 06:30.275
Yeah.

06:31.036 --> 06:33.580
And that's the last copy.

06:35.382 --> 06:39.388
And the point is they didn't have enough.

06:39.408 --> 06:39.668
Space is it.

06:40.846 --> 06:42.007
Yeah, these are tipped in.

06:42.027 --> 06:45.771
These could be lithographs, you know.

06:45.791 --> 06:46.131
Look at that.

06:46.151 --> 06:48.233
Look at that.

06:48.253 --> 06:52.557
There's some stamps.

06:54.519 --> 06:55.160
This is nice.

06:55.721 --> 07:07.512
This is The Way to Study Birds by John Dryden, K-U-S-E-R, with some color illustrations by Putnam's, 1917, New York.

07:08.656 --> 07:11.580
This was the one that really got me for some reason.

07:11.600 --> 07:18.229
The Rivers of North America.

07:18.389 --> 07:28.182
The reason why this could be discarded by the library was because they had a logic that an out-of-date book would be discarded.

07:28.222 --> 07:32.588
Well, The Rivers of North America, 1907, by Israel Russell.

07:32.990 --> 07:34.632
is indeed an out-of-date book.

07:34.652 --> 07:36.053
I mean, the rivers are very different.

07:36.073 --> 07:37.194
Well, out-of-date, in what respect?

07:37.214 --> 07:40.197
That scholarship has gone beyond the latest?

07:40.257 --> 07:40.477
Yes.

07:40.557 --> 07:41.999
I mean, well, the point, yeah.

07:42.059 --> 07:48.305
They have, for instance, here, Analysis of American River Waters, Reduced to Parts per Thousand.

07:48.706 --> 07:55.733
Now, this study happened, you know, circa, whenever that was, 1907.

07:56.113 --> 07:58.836
This may even be a later, slightly later edition.

07:58.856 --> 08:00.297
It's the last copy in the library.

08:00.715 --> 08:09.348
this is of great importance to the Bay Area because of, you know, the problem with aquifers and, you know, water here.

08:09.829 --> 08:13.514
Anyway, so they've analyzed the trace minerals in this chart.

08:14.435 --> 08:17.360
Now, just look also, this has been taped.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.121
This has been used.

08:18.161 --> 08:19.643
This book is not sitting around.

08:19.844 --> 08:23.669
The claim can't be made that this is a book that hasn't been used.

08:23.829 --> 08:24.030
Right.

08:24.050 --> 08:27.014
Sorry, but that's... Yeah, yeah, well, it's been used.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.558
And this guy...

08:30.449 --> 08:37.275
wrote a bunch of other books which, well, so this was in the discard room.

08:37.295 --> 08:48.886
So we know that they decided in their wisdom that The Rivers of North America was a book that should no longer be available to San Francisco, was of no interest.

08:48.906 --> 08:53.270
In other words, they were deciding we will not be a research librarian anymore.

08:53.290 --> 08:59.055
But I have that, I think I have this one on the computer discard list, right?

08:59.491 --> 09:06.499
But there are a number of other books by Russell, who turns out to have worked for the U.S.

09:06.559 --> 09:12.205
Geological Survey for a time, that are in the card catalog.

09:12.225 --> 09:20.014
And the only reason I know that they're in the card catalog is because I had to sue them for access to the card catalog, and finally got a couple of drawers.

09:20.174 --> 09:23.558
I got something, I think, 18 drawers of the card catalog sent over.

09:23.578 --> 09:24.278
So I looked up.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.642
One of the drawers I asked for was the one containing Russell.

09:27.959 --> 09:37.848
So I looked up the cards for Russell and compared them with the records in the online catalog, some of which are so-called empty records, which mean that the books were purged.

09:37.868 --> 09:45.796
And it turns out that there are more books in the card catalog than there are in the online catalog.

09:46.817 --> 09:50.500
And I know that there have been earlier purges of the online records.

09:50.520 --> 09:57.747
So all that indicates that

09:58.773 --> 10:00.956
Well, you can assume two things.

10:00.976 --> 10:12.292
Either that, in this case, that somebody was intently interested in stealing the other Russell books, which is highly unlikely because there are certain categories of books that are the objects of theft.

10:12.412 --> 10:18.161
Astrology, sex books, how-to books are the big ones.

10:18.181 --> 10:21.025
Also books with pretty nice old books with plates in them.

10:21.285 --> 10:24.730
Books with plates are very, very easily...

10:25.047 --> 10:33.916
But a book like this, which has no antiquarian value, really, because antiquarian books are generally bound at the San Francisco Public Library.

10:33.976 --> 10:34.256
Right.

10:34.296 --> 10:35.717
They don't want excrevers kind of thing.

10:36.258 --> 10:43.205
So this book is very unlikely to be stolen, and the other kinds of books by Russell.

10:43.405 --> 10:52.033
So what happened is that the librarian earlier purges, we did that book.

10:52.570 --> 11:13.563
And so the only way you actually have getting a better idea of what was in the San Francisco Public Library before all of this recent insanity is by comparing the cart catalog with the online catalog.

11:14.024 --> 11:16.468
Otherwise, you have no sense of what was actually there.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.272
There are two ways.

11:18.572 --> 11:21.656
That's one of the reasons they won't maybe want to get rid of the car catalog.

11:21.856 --> 11:39.199
Well, that's what I charged in that thing, which is that, you know, in a sense, the car catalog is the only evidence of the... Now, there are problems with that, because many books were stolen, so they can always say, in a given instance, they can always say, well, you don't know, that book might have been stolen.

11:39.219 --> 11:43.906
So we always have a way of, you know, covering, getting out of that.

11:43.926 --> 11:45.628
But...

11:46.418 --> 11:53.487
The real harm to the old collection was not done by casual book feeds.

11:53.927 --> 12:02.838
The real harm was done by the systematic fleeting in accordance with a radical reconception.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.861
Do you think it was a plan?

12:05.762 --> 12:10.688
Coulter, by the way, says there's no plan.

12:11.073 --> 12:16.281
I asked him yesterday, who sent the trucks there?

12:16.301 --> 12:17.143
Who gave the order?

12:17.844 --> 12:20.749
And he said, well, there's a lot of this, which doesn't show up on the tape.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.672
He said, there's a lot of this going on, you know.

12:23.173 --> 12:27.680
But we really, he said, I wanted an investigation, but we really don't know.

12:27.740 --> 12:34.491
I said, you know, with all due respect, I said, that should be a pretty easy thing to find out, to find out who ordered the trucks.

12:35.052 --> 12:38.177
You know, I mean, the chain of command on orders should be pretty easy to,

12:38.579 --> 12:46.552
Well, I know who ordered the trucks, but the guy who ordered the trucks isn't to blame.

12:46.572 --> 12:48.715
He was acting on the orders of a superior.

12:48.775 --> 13:01.435
What happened was all libraries throw away books, and they had a quiet deal with the Department of Public Works, in which the Department of Public Works would pick up their things.

13:01.455 --> 13:02.958
I don't know what they got in exchange.

13:02.978 --> 13:06.443
I've never been able to find out what the incentive was.

13:06.878 --> 13:27.046
They were, whenever they had a certain amount of surplus books that needed, we needed books or books that they wanted to get rid of, or the important branches or something, they called the DPW, and for no charge, with no records kept, apparently, because I just tried to get the records from the DPW.

13:27.066 --> 13:27.346
Did you?

13:27.366 --> 13:29.610
That's the second word that I'd like to call the DPW.

13:29.670 --> 13:32.033
Well, no, no, good luck.

13:32.053 --> 13:35.738
I mean, I talked to Pernu, who's the, you know,

13:35.836 --> 13:41.544
I talked to the guy.

13:41.845 --> 13:44.228
They have no record, they say.

13:44.248 --> 13:54.302
Now, I have the actual number of the truck that did the regular pickups during the most recent 1996 session.

13:54.383 --> 13:56.546
Was it a dump truck?

13:56.566 --> 13:57.507
Was it a van?

13:57.547 --> 13:59.370
Well, I can show you the pictures of it.

13:59.510 --> 14:02.434
Oh, you got a picture of it?

14:02.920 --> 14:05.644
Because staff members, you know, were upset by this.

14:05.664 --> 14:17.182
I mean, there was, you know, there was mid-1996, when things really started to accelerate, there were some very, very unhappy librarians, technicians, pages.

14:17.422 --> 14:30.042
I mean, it was a feeling that they were working within a system that was intent on destroying itself.

14:33.143 --> 14:35.166
I suppose I sang it at the Department of Public Works.

14:35.206 --> 14:45.222
Anyway, I know who the guy is who ordered the trucks, but he was simply doing a system that had been in place for many years.

14:45.783 --> 14:52.734
We're not clear, but maybe a long time, but in very small quantity.

14:52.754 --> 15:00.045
The point is that libraries have, say, many duplicates of books in print.

15:00.481 --> 15:01.642
that are very hard to get rid of.

15:01.942 --> 15:08.048
There are lots of reasons why a library might want to throw away books as opposed to trying to give them away.

15:08.068 --> 15:11.752
Book dealers, book buyers don't want all books.

15:11.772 --> 15:12.673
That's the fact.

15:12.693 --> 15:12.973
Right.

15:13.274 --> 15:16.497
So you've got a lot of paper that you have to get rid of.

15:16.517 --> 15:17.778
And that's perfectly legitimate.

15:18.299 --> 15:28.969
But what happened was that under the Dowland administration, they ramped up an existing program to discard books, to landfill books.

15:29.540 --> 15:39.851
and made it a way of quietly, quietly purging the library of its older books.

15:39.871 --> 15:43.615
And it happened beginning with the earthquake.

15:43.635 --> 15:49.281
After the earthquake, there was a big, a sudden kind of panicked feeling that, well, we've got to leave, we've got to leave.

15:49.301 --> 15:50.763
Well, it maybe gave them the cover.

15:50.863 --> 15:57.370
It was a blessing in there that you could follow the sudden made it possible

15:57.873 --> 16:02.999
to do something at an accelerated pace that wasn't possible, otherwise, previously.

16:03.019 --> 16:10.187
Yeah, well, I mean, more than one librarian said to me, the best thing that ever happened to Ken Dallin.

16:10.207 --> 16:13.591
The earthquake was the best thing that ever happened to Ken Dallin.

16:13.611 --> 16:26.125
And the reason why they say that is because he, there were consultant reports floating around that said, the library has to be weeded.

16:27.488 --> 16:33.855
This guy, Bill Holman, who you should talk to, was sort of like your Texas guy.

16:34.035 --> 16:46.769
He had a dream to make San Francisco a really great research library, and he bought a lot of stuff.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.753
This is probably a Holman-era book, 66.

16:50.233 --> 16:53.437
All the 60s books.

16:53.497 --> 16:57.141
Logical papers by Blackness.

16:57.661 --> 17:10.358
Now, this is a two, and the title is Logical Fapers, edited by Parkinson's, G.H.R.

17:10.418 --> 17:17.327
Parkinson, an Oxford, a Clarendon Press, not an Oxford View Press, but a Clarendon Press edition.

17:17.707 --> 17:24.276
This, you know, is a valuable book.

17:24.492 --> 17:26.355
you know, spent a lot of money buying books.

17:26.455 --> 17:29.641
And that would not have been an inexpensive book to buy, by the way.

17:29.661 --> 17:29.941
Right.

17:29.962 --> 17:32.386
And they bought two of them, because that was the policy.

17:32.646 --> 17:38.196
You buy two, or even three in some cases, if it's a... Probably not for this one.

17:39.298 --> 17:48.053
So that if one wears out, you know, that you have... It's a prudent way of managing the collections, to buy one, have one circulate, one

17:48.623 --> 18:02.417
So what the library was doing, the one thing was throwing away its boots, which to me is bad, but not as bad.

18:02.537 --> 18:09.744
But the other thing they were doing was simply throwing away their last copy, which is a real thing.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.046
That's when knowledge takes a real hit.

18:12.066 --> 18:17.972
But in all these cases, this was part of the intellectual patrimony

18:18.610 --> 18:25.719
San Francisco, this wasn't stuff owned by booksellers and book collectors and book dealers.

18:25.739 --> 18:47.908
This was stuff that was owned by the citizenry of San Francisco, and therefore the management, I think, really had no right to decide that, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of books ought to be

18:48.277 --> 18:51.641
thrown away or given away.

18:52.262 --> 19:17.676
That, I think, is a wasteful and possibly criminal act, a decision to deprive people for whom the San Francisco Public Library is really the only really good free library available to them of thousands of books that they can't get anywhere else

19:18.837 --> 19:20.439
in the Bay Area.

19:20.499 --> 19:29.569
I asked the three librarians that were here tonight, what's, you know, what would be a good solution for you under the circumstances?

19:29.589 --> 19:33.954
I mean, would you like them to tear down the building?

19:33.974 --> 19:41.643
And, you know, they really didn't have a... What would your response to that question be?

19:41.683 --> 19:47.950
Well, I think that there's a great book building right across the street.

19:48.740 --> 19:51.403
called the San Francisco Public Library building.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.705
It still got stacks.

19:53.725 --> 19:57.989
But the stacks were going to all be torn out for the Asian Art Museum.

19:58.009 --> 20:04.996
So the sensible thing to do would be to say to the Asian Art Museum, we're terribly sorry.

20:05.917 --> 20:10.102
Previous planners made a very bad decision.

20:10.642 --> 20:15.507
This is the only building that currently, for very little expense, could hold.

20:16.229 --> 20:20.154
all the books that are in San Francisco's communal collection.

20:20.295 --> 20:21.556
This is the only building.

20:21.576 --> 20:22.918
It's a beautiful building.

20:22.938 --> 20:28.686
It's festooned with words relating to the nobility books.

20:28.706 --> 20:30.068
It was designed to hold books.

20:30.088 --> 20:31.230
It holds books very well.

20:33.272 --> 20:38.119
And, I mean, it's right across the street, you know.

20:38.139 --> 20:39.240
And that is the solution.

20:40.242 --> 20:44.768
But, and actually the strange thing was, I wrote a letter to Willie Brown about it, saying, you know,

20:46.098 --> 20:48.821
There are these malefactors.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.624
Dallin was a good person to get rid of.

20:51.644 --> 20:58.070
Kathy Page you ought to get rid of because she was the one most responsible for ordering the panic meeting.

20:58.090 --> 21:05.237
And Roberto Estevez and Marcia Schneider and one other.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.759
Price.

21:06.779 --> 21:12.865
If you get rid of those administrators and you get rid of Poulter because he's

21:13.148 --> 21:20.524
He allowed all this to happen, A, and B, his level of conflictedness of his interest.

21:20.544 --> 21:33.030
So mind-blowing is to be, you know, every single day, he cannot make a disinterested decision because Pac Bell is the supplier of

21:35.002 --> 21:37.725
electrical pipelines for the city.

21:37.745 --> 21:40.589
So I thought there was a million-dollar phone bill there.

21:40.609 --> 21:41.089
Did you know that?

21:41.250 --> 21:43.612
Well, there's a big phone bill, yeah.

21:43.692 --> 21:46.476
I thought it was in $980,000.

21:46.496 --> 21:50.821
Yeah, I mean, it's in, yeah, $800,000, something like that.

21:50.841 --> 21:51.302
I don't know.

21:51.322 --> 21:51.502
Exactly.

21:51.522 --> 21:52.703
There's a big phone bill, yeah.

21:53.224 --> 21:56.228
And the phone bill is difficult to break out the phone bill, of course.

21:56.248 --> 22:01.554
But what I'm saying, you're talking about just the appearance of a complex.

22:01.574 --> 22:04.097
Well, he's actually had to recuse himself from decisions.

22:04.381 --> 22:23.364
At Library Commission meetings, I cannot vote on whether or not to install a T1 line that would link the branches with several T1 lines, which are leased lines that the city would lease from Pac Bell in order to provide high-speed catalog links to the central computer.

22:23.504 --> 22:33.797
He had to recuse himself because Pac Bell was trying to get the leased line revenue, at least possibly.

22:34.638 --> 22:59.019
But to me, you can't just recuse yourself from that one decision because Pac Bell is in the business of digital storage and retrieval, of passing digitized information over space.

23:00.280 --> 23:04.324
And that is part of the library's fundamental mission now.

23:05.603 --> 23:14.877
Part of what a library does is allow you to look up things remotely.

23:15.318 --> 23:34.227
The library has increasingly decided to do that, and one only has to infer that one of the reasons why the library has spent multi-million dollar sums on this is because it accords with Pac Bell's financial objectives

23:34.662 --> 23:52.424
Ken Dowlin's enthusiasm, and that Coulter tolerated Ken Dowlin's mismanagement and inability to plan because Dowlin was willing to spend the kind of money in the direction that Coulter wanted to spend.

23:52.444 --> 23:57.290
I mean, that's... He's ready to cut him loose now, by the way, Coulter.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.352
Well, but he defended him.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.615
I mean, he wanted...

24:02.455 --> 24:06.440
I'm kind of stepping back a little bit now because I can't make a few mistakes.

24:07.801 --> 24:10.004
Yeah, yeah.

24:10.024 --> 24:13.408
But I love the sense of survival that it clicks every once in a while.

24:13.628 --> 24:26.843
Well, when a guy's been, you know, in a way, I do think that Dowling is the person most to blame for the damage that was done to the collection, which is my, you know.

24:26.883 --> 24:29.766
I'm seeing Dowling, by the way, where it's set Thursday night.

24:30.607 --> 24:31.348
Interesting.

24:32.155 --> 25:01.318
Not because I think he specifically threw the books in the truck or anything, but because he put in place an institutional climate that simply didn't value or pay attention to the basic requirements of book storage and book catalogs.

25:06.563 --> 25:07.284
That was excellent.

25:07.704 --> 25:20.095
That observation on the intellectual patrimony of San Francisco, it does crystallize it, capsulize it.

25:20.316 --> 25:21.457
I'm reluctant.

25:22.578 --> 25:30.445
The whole way that the argument has turned, the argument has become a financial one.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.668
In other words,

25:35.791 --> 25:42.519
How in debt did Dowling leave the librarian, and how much money was wasted?

25:42.899 --> 25:56.015
I actually am less interested in the waste of money, because all public institutions waste money, and many great public institutions run deficits.

25:56.035 --> 26:05.646
What I don't like is when a public institution vandalizes itself, you know, and decides, we will

26:05.828 --> 26:19.782
spend, if not waste, a huge amount of money, and also almost gleefully.

26:19.802 --> 26:34.857
I mean, I don't want to use charged words like defoliate or decimate or something.

26:35.512 --> 26:43.162
We will harm the existing book collection.

26:43.182 --> 26:49.951
That's what was so hard for me to understand when I first realized that was what was going so hard for me to believe.

26:51.574 --> 26:56.140
But that is clearly what went on.

26:57.101 --> 27:05.232
And I think that the moral that other libraries have to draw from that is that if you

27:05.617 --> 27:33.970
I think I said this to you before, but if you hire a guy who is an enthusiast for cable TV, which he was, you can tell from his early book, and fancy computer systems and everything, you're not going to get somebody, unless you're really lucky, who has any notion of book culture.

27:35.553 --> 27:42.742
Dallin was not a stupid man, but he was not a bookman.

27:45.045 --> 27:45.926
He didn't understand.

27:46.126 --> 27:51.053
He didn't understand what these things are.

27:51.073 --> 27:54.116
He would talk about the warehouse mentality.

27:54.217 --> 27:57.000
We have to get away from the warehouse mentality.

27:57.581 --> 28:01.746
Book storage to him was, these books weren't moving.

28:01.928 --> 28:03.450
the electrons weren't going.

28:03.630 --> 28:05.893
You know, they were just sitting on a shelf.

28:05.913 --> 28:07.455
I'm thinking of questions for Dallin.

28:08.296 --> 28:14.804
If you were in my shoes going over there to see him in his home Thursday night, what would you like to see himself?

28:16.706 --> 28:30.784
Well, I've heard him, I mean, he tends to say, I think you pointed this out, most of the digital futurists have learned not to say the book is dead.

28:31.425 --> 28:31.665
You know,

28:31.949 --> 28:42.127
They made that mistake ten years ago, and Dowling was certainly in the group of people who would say, well, I don't know where we're going.

28:42.147 --> 28:43.870
We're going to be reading this stuff off the screen.

28:45.813 --> 28:49.480
So they all made that mistake, and now they say the book is here to stay.

28:49.821 --> 28:51.283
I don't hate books.

28:51.303 --> 28:54.649
I love books.

28:56.975 --> 29:01.721
So, I mean, I'd be interested to know what current variation.

29:01.741 --> 29:05.746
I love books, but we have to, we can't be stuck in the past.

29:05.766 --> 29:09.410
But specifically, a hard news kind of a question.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.294
What do you think he should, I should ask him to account?

29:13.956 --> 29:20.704
Well, I think he should, I think, did, you know, any, some people have suggested that

29:21.190 --> 29:23.394
What's your response to, you know?

29:23.494 --> 29:23.674
Right.

29:23.955 --> 29:24.235
Why?

29:24.716 --> 29:26.379
I mean, is there a number of— I mean, for yourself.

29:26.419 --> 29:36.615
I mean, you certainly must have some burning questions that you'd like to ask them if you were— Well, I mean, I made a number of requests, legal requests, that were part of a suit.

29:36.635 --> 29:46.211
And I know that the documents that were gathered in order to fulfill the suit were never provided for me.

29:46.231 --> 29:47.333
They simply sat on them.

29:48.275 --> 29:53.501
So I would be personally curious why I never got this stuff I was asked before.

29:53.521 --> 29:55.103
But that's my own thing.

29:55.163 --> 30:03.773
I'm very curious, since the computer is good at record keeping in some ways.

30:05.435 --> 30:11.763
All you have to do if you purge the records from the online catalog is keep a tape.

30:12.003 --> 30:14.186
Keep a tape of those purged records.

30:15.127 --> 30:16.088
Why is it?

30:16.557 --> 30:21.003
There are no records of all those books that went to the dump.

30:21.023 --> 30:22.245
Well, that's a brilliant question.

30:22.365 --> 30:24.568
I mean, what happened to those records?

30:24.668 --> 30:32.919
Why is it that it was considered a matter of... It was so difficult.

30:32.940 --> 30:35.643
It was so... I know he has an answer for this.

30:35.683 --> 30:37.866
What do you think the answer would be?

30:38.347 --> 30:39.649
I mean, not for that question.

30:39.669 --> 30:43.093
I don't know what the answer to that one would be.

30:43.154 --> 30:44.235
The question about the...

30:44.384 --> 30:47.828
card catalog, you know, I asked to see it before the speech.

30:47.848 --> 30:54.776
Well, I think the question is, did you order the books to go to the landfill?

30:54.877 --> 30:57.580
Was this something that emanated from your office?

30:59.162 --> 30:59.722
Yes or no?

30:59.863 --> 31:01.485
I mean, what's the answer to that?

31:01.605 --> 31:02.245
That's it.

31:02.326 --> 31:03.407
That's it.

31:03.427 --> 31:09.314
And I'm sure he'll say no, because he said, I'm not a hands-on kind of person.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.355
I delegate.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.316
Other people did it.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.340
The thing to know about the old library is

31:14.708 --> 31:22.239
that the smoking room, the smoking area, is right next to the discard room.

31:22.259 --> 31:22.700
Okay?

31:22.720 --> 31:23.821
Dowlin is a smoker.

31:25.403 --> 31:37.841
The people who were the smokers were the ones who got the most detailed understanding of the fact that books were being sent to the dump.

31:37.861 --> 31:42.548
Those books that were going on the back of the DPW trucks were going to the dump.

31:42.688 --> 31:43.770
And he knew that.

31:44.543 --> 32:08.475
Even if he had not said to somebody, to his, you know, A-team, send the books to the dump, if he was a guy who believed that those books should be preserved, the first time he had a cigarette and saw the books loaded onto the DPW truck, he ought to have put a stop to it.

32:08.535 --> 32:09.677
Well, what's going on here?

32:10.217 --> 32:11.059
What's happening here?

32:11.559 --> 32:13.622
The question would be...

32:14.092 --> 32:16.095
I mean, this isn't even deaccessioning.

32:16.115 --> 32:18.499
Deaccessioning is a process.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.744
And you do, and as you put deaccessioning, you keep records.

32:21.764 --> 32:27.373
And you keep records, and you study, and you make, you know, maybe this isn't in our collecting interest anymore.

32:27.433 --> 32:31.018
Maybe, you know, I mean, this is not deaccessioning.

32:31.038 --> 32:32.100
This is dumping.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.223
This is getting rid of stuff.

32:34.243 --> 32:41.955
And the reason the dumping happened was there were, I mean, there were several reasons, one of which was, unfortunately,

32:42.104 --> 32:46.310
The library was given a huge amount of money to spend, and they spent it on books.

32:47.191 --> 32:49.714
And they ought to have spent it on books.

32:49.734 --> 32:55.663
But the branches had no room, and so they sent their books back to the main.

32:55.683 --> 33:04.114
And there was no program in place to evaluate which books ought to be kept as part of the research collection and which should get thrown out.

33:04.655 --> 33:06.237
And of course, it was bad press.

33:06.257 --> 33:09.141
The idea that you would be giving a library

33:09.728 --> 33:22.544
the voters would have given the library lots and lots of money from Proposition E, and then lots and lots of old books would be falling out the door, even if they were being given away.

33:23.045 --> 33:25.728
It's just, you know, that's a bad public relations thing.

33:25.748 --> 33:27.470
Of course you have to do it quietly.

33:28.231 --> 33:35.160
So they would, you know, once the bad press started getting up, they would cover up the top of the books.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.963
The books would be covered up with, say, a mattress pad.

33:38.399 --> 33:51.799
More recently, there was a load of books that came from the library, and they put four-by-eight plywood panels on the side, so you couldn't see that there were books.

33:52.099 --> 33:55.665
And the books were on boxes and everything.

33:55.685 --> 34:07.883
And those books, I think, were books that were being dumped, but they were books that were actually gifts from outside to be put on sale, and then for one reason they didn't get sold.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.201
There's no space.

34:09.902 --> 34:11.443
Some of those books have to get thrown out.

34:11.463 --> 34:14.906
But, of course, they can't tell, you know.

34:14.926 --> 34:19.711
Very, very, very interesting.

34:20.672 --> 34:23.295
Another thing, the sculptor is amazing.

34:23.315 --> 34:32.143
I said, you know, this library has been open for a little more than a year, and already not only is it full, there's no room for what you have.

34:32.984 --> 34:34.225
How could you possibly...

34:34.964 --> 34:36.847
be preparing for the next century.

34:38.569 --> 34:41.113
What now is in place for future acquisitions?

34:41.133 --> 34:50.586
He said, well, you know, we spent so much money on new books, four and a half million dollars, that we filled it up a lot faster than, I mean, filled it up fast and filled it up overnight.

34:50.606 --> 34:57.416
But that's the kind of answer that he gives you, that we spent four and a half million dollars, and I'm going to ask for that information.

34:57.436 --> 34:58.498
I'd love to know precisely.

34:58.578 --> 35:00.861
I said, do you have any numbers on titles, really?

35:00.941 --> 35:01.562
I said, I

35:01.964 --> 35:03.266
They're actually renting books.

35:03.546 --> 35:07.052
The women told me that there's a service, that they rent bestsellers.

35:07.212 --> 35:08.674
Yeah, they do rent bestsellers.

35:08.694 --> 35:18.470
They did spend a ton of money on books, but, you know, it's like eight copies of the Rough Guy Degrees or something.

35:18.850 --> 35:19.431
Why?

35:19.932 --> 35:25.120
Because, well, that's legit, because the public wants certain kinds of books, you know?

35:25.319 --> 35:28.102
And so you've got to buy a lot of copies.

35:28.182 --> 35:37.991
When you have a huge branch system, the way this has, you have to buy 10, 12 copies of certain popular books.

35:38.011 --> 35:43.496
But, you know, I mean, I guess you can say you have to.

35:44.096 --> 35:53.605
But you could also say that the library's task is not to give the public

35:53.922 --> 35:55.564
exactly what it wants.

35:55.584 --> 35:59.148
It's sort of like a dictionary.

35:59.929 --> 36:07.318
You don't want to fossilize every bit of bad usage.

36:07.338 --> 36:10.342
You want to be a little bit better, maybe, than the prevailing norm.

36:11.063 --> 36:22.056
And so if you're building a collection, you want maybe not to

36:22.762 --> 36:49.765
attempt to duplicate the bestseller list because and to compete with the big book chains because you know they're doing a very good job at getting the public books that were widely available that they want right now i mean the library also has a as a function that goes beyond providing the book that everybody wants to read today the point the library is supposed to be partly um the the community's memory and

36:50.015 --> 37:02.373
You know, the book that was popular in 1912 is an interesting book to have, even if it's not asked for, you know, one decade to the next now.

37:03.575 --> 37:19.498
And the library, the San Francisco Public Library, until very recently, classed itself as and treated itself as a research library, a depository library that would hold on to that sort of book.

37:20.525 --> 37:22.908
And that's where I think Dallin is to blame.

37:23.008 --> 37:34.565
Dallin has said in print that the SFPL is a public library, not a research library.

37:34.585 --> 37:41.014
Or, no, not a research facility, which is an interesting kind of way of jazzing up the terminology.

37:41.034 --> 37:42.676
But that's a spurious distinction.

37:42.696 --> 37:44.358
It's not a research facility.

37:44.378 --> 37:49.806
The New York Public Library is a public library and a research facility.

37:50.022 --> 37:54.168
And, in fact, many public libraries, any number of other libraries.

37:54.288 --> 37:55.750
Boston has one of the finest.

37:55.870 --> 37:56.331
Chicago.

37:56.451 --> 37:57.473
Philadelphia.

37:57.493 --> 37:59.395
Cleveland has extraordinary.

37:59.415 --> 38:00.757
Believe it or not.

38:00.777 --> 38:06.766
Every city of the size of San Francisco has a public library that is also a research library.

38:06.786 --> 38:07.567
A research library.

38:07.647 --> 38:14.937
I mean, they have absolutely an area set aside for special collections with special reading areas.

38:15.198 --> 38:17.882
You know, you have to have your number two pencils.

38:17.982 --> 38:19.123
I mean, you're monitored.

38:19.143 --> 38:19.624
I mean, this is...

38:20.060 --> 38:42.704
But the collection development plan, which is a big document, specifically went through all the components by call number and gave them a numerical, assigned them a number from one to six, or zero to six, I guess.

38:42.784 --> 38:48.210
Zero meaning not collected and six meaning comprehensively collected.

38:48.646 --> 38:57.176
And so, and this group of people who was, the collection development plan was, I think, requested by Dallin and was overseen by Kathy Page.

38:58.058 --> 39:04.686
And the result of it was to make a set of value judgments about what part of the collection should be research level.

39:05.787 --> 39:10.072
I think only a very few words then.

39:10.092 --> 39:13.496
And what parts of the, oh, you're going to lose that.

39:13.516 --> 39:14.017
Shall we go in?

39:14.337 --> 39:15.699
Yeah.

39:15.719 --> 39:17.481
You're going to lose that.

39:17.501 --> 39:18.062
Oh, I won't lose it.

39:18.869 --> 39:29.369
This was in the discard room that same day.

39:30.431 --> 39:32.715
The growth of literature by Chadwick.

39:32.735 --> 39:35.881
Here's a multi-volume account.

39:35.961 --> 39:42.193
They would discard a book if they only had one volume of it.

39:42.528 --> 39:44.030
That was an amazing thing.

39:44.050 --> 39:45.012
Wait, do that again?

39:45.352 --> 39:53.705
If they only had one volume of the multi-volume set, or no, if they had a multi-volume set and one volume was missing, that was one of the sort of rules of thumb for discarding.

39:53.725 --> 39:59.414
So if they had four volumes of the elephant folio autobahn and not the fifth.

39:59.434 --> 40:01.177
I'm just saying that's kind of the... Right.

40:01.217 --> 40:02.539
Look at this.

40:02.559 --> 40:04.402
Look at the binding on that tomorrow.

40:04.422 --> 40:05.123
What's the title of that?

40:05.804 --> 40:06.585
I don't know.

40:06.806 --> 40:07.607
This is...

40:08.853 --> 40:20.487
History of Germany, Deutsche Geschichte, Karl Lamprecht, L-A-N-P-R-E-C-H-T.

40:20.908 --> 40:33.443
And this is the first Peter Bond of the fifth book.

40:34.334 --> 40:37.998
I don't remember if I checked whether this is the last copy or not.

40:38.399 --> 40:39.180
Well, it's not.

40:39.280 --> 40:46.128
You'd be surprised, because the library was really good about keeping dupes and kids.

40:46.148 --> 40:46.588
Here's this.

40:46.809 --> 40:47.309
I like this.

40:47.790 --> 40:51.154
Thompson's History of Rome, Volume 2.

40:51.334 --> 40:55.459
I would have done anything to have that book when I was one of the ages of madness.

40:55.479 --> 40:59.864
Thompson, the guy that's there, his hair caught on fire.

40:59.944 --> 41:02.367
And when he was reading a book in his library,

41:02.617 --> 41:06.601
He was one of these persons that was basically killed from reading.

41:06.621 --> 41:08.563
I mean, literally.

41:08.723 --> 41:09.603
Did you just read the text?

41:09.704 --> 41:10.464
I missed that one.

41:10.484 --> 41:13.087
I was just reading with great pleasure the Texas chapter.

41:13.127 --> 41:14.948
Oh, the Texas chapter's great.

41:14.968 --> 41:18.231
I see this chapter being a lot like the Texas chapter.

41:18.251 --> 41:30.683
These, some of these, now I've got, like, supersonic cruise technology, and I think Ruskin's Seven Lamps of Architecture are probably, uh,

41:32.131 --> 41:39.220
from later, when I went back at one point later and got him.

41:41.162 --> 41:44.466
I think Ruskin, but there's a dupe.

41:44.486 --> 41:49.893
See, I mean, this is sad this book was being given away, because it's obviously going to have value.

41:50.013 --> 41:50.574
I would like it.

41:53.117 --> 41:57.322
But there are other copies of Ruskin and Weisler.

41:57.342 --> 41:57.743
Give me a second.

41:57.763 --> 41:59.725
You realize that this is a Nobel laureate.

42:00.802 --> 42:04.747
And look at the use of that book received.

42:04.907 --> 42:05.448
Yeah.

42:05.468 --> 42:06.168
Oh, yeah.

42:06.269 --> 42:07.370
Look at this.

42:07.390 --> 42:07.871
One, two.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.633
This is from 81 to 85.

42:10.133 --> 42:16.201
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

42:16.501 --> 42:16.961
Checkouts.

42:16.982 --> 42:18.203
17 checkouts.

42:18.463 --> 42:22.388
And that's just, that's before, see, 81 is when they started that system before that.

42:22.621 --> 42:46.401
had the little pocket and that's when you i'm just saying from 1981 tonight's over a four-year period and this book was published in 1911 this is volume two of the history of rome by momson uh and what year did he die this is about this is very close to the year that he died but it's but it's volume two it's scriptures um uh 1911

42:47.630 --> 42:53.395
And because this is volume two, clearly something happened to volume one, and so they dumped it.

42:53.695 --> 43:00.562
Well, that was one of the things that people thought, that the guy told me one of the reasons why books would be conspired.

43:01.062 --> 43:03.504
The main reason was conditions.

43:03.524 --> 43:04.265
What's wrong with this?

43:05.306 --> 43:06.567
Nothing, nothing.

43:06.587 --> 43:16.776
But library bindings were also, you know, you wanted a library with lots of nice, fresh new books, and so library bindings were kind of... You know, books are meant to be used.

43:17.414 --> 43:24.967
John Silver at BU, I want books to be abused.

43:25.047 --> 43:26.350
I want people to handle them.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.952
I want them to use them.

43:27.972 --> 43:29.475
I want sweating.

43:29.495 --> 43:30.777
That's what a book is for.

43:30.797 --> 43:34.844
I don't want to see books in great condition, but that means nobody's reading them.

43:34.864 --> 43:35.846
That's right.

43:35.866 --> 43:39.793
My feeling about a library binding is I know that book

43:40.853 --> 43:44.056
has gotten a lot of wear and tear that lots of people have wanted.

43:44.116 --> 43:46.398
It's a piece of information about a book.

43:46.419 --> 43:48.881
By the way, I was a temp for John Silver.

43:48.901 --> 43:49.281
Is that right?

43:50.002 --> 43:50.362
You're kidding.

43:50.543 --> 43:52.164
I typed his personal course on it.

43:52.204 --> 43:53.746
This is our second album.

43:53.766 --> 43:54.246
In Boston.

43:54.266 --> 43:56.508
Father Boyle.

43:57.289 --> 43:59.872
Silver is in the Texas chapter.

43:59.892 --> 44:00.713
I just read it.

44:00.733 --> 44:01.133
He's good.

44:01.293 --> 44:02.655
I have nice quotes.

44:02.675 --> 44:06.398
He's a little difficult to work for, but that's okay.

44:07.039 --> 44:10.202
I once misspelled Armagnac.

44:10.942 --> 44:14.266
I spelled it A-R-M-A-N-I-A-C.

44:14.326 --> 44:14.887
Oh, jeez.

44:15.047 --> 44:21.775
In a personal letter, he was writing to a big wine dealer saying, you know, could we have a case of Armagnac or something.

44:21.815 --> 44:23.016
And I spelled it Armagnac.

44:24.478 --> 44:30.065
And I got these scrawled marginal comments about, oh, we're not talking about braised Armenians.

44:30.666 --> 44:31.627
It's, look it up.

44:31.647 --> 44:33.129
Oh, no, he didn't tell me the spelling.

44:33.149 --> 44:34.310
He said, look it up.

44:34.330 --> 44:36.873
And I've never forgotten the spelling of Armagnac.

44:36.933 --> 44:39.396
It's got a G. Thanks to silver, I know it.

44:40.405 --> 44:49.017
I, you know, I was 24 at the time, which is, I mean, who knows, maybe at 40 I would have known the spelling of Armagnac, I don't know.

44:49.057 --> 44:55.486
Yeah, but what he taught you there, if it's not the spelling of Armagnac, he taught you to look things up.

44:55.506 --> 44:57.269
Yeah, I mean, you're not sure of the spelling.

44:57.589 --> 45:09.045
I mean, I think he, you know, I'm not in accord with all his political beliefs, and I think he was a digital manager, but he's unquestionably a bright man, and, you know, the

45:09.447 --> 45:11.652
He'd have been a very interesting governor, that's for sure.

45:13.236 --> 45:18.408
But here's another one, the Principles of Science that treat us on logic and scientific method.

45:18.428 --> 45:24.000
The library decided the natural history and science collection, they went through.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.388
They just went through it, and they decided it was not

45:30.642 --> 45:34.065
Well, anyway, we've done another one.

45:34.506 --> 45:35.247
This is one I liked.

45:35.287 --> 45:36.868
This is an out-of-date book.

45:36.908 --> 45:38.670
This was not in the discard room.

45:38.690 --> 45:43.175
Most of the books I've been showing you, I walked out straight from the discard room.

45:44.156 --> 45:46.178
This was later in one of the giveaways.

45:46.198 --> 45:47.439
What is it?

45:47.459 --> 45:49.221
Photomicrographs of Iron and Steel.

45:49.862 --> 45:51.483
Photomicrographs.

45:51.603 --> 45:53.265
You wrote about a lot of these, I think.

45:53.485 --> 45:56.148
Photomicrographs of Iron and Steel, 1929.

45:56.809 --> 46:00.092
I don't think I did write about this one.

46:00.443 --> 46:07.211
Because, obviously, there are a lot of new books with Photo of My Progressive Iron and Steel.

46:07.231 --> 46:14.840
The fact is, however, the library doesn't have enough money to buy those books, because they have tiny acquisitions budgets right now.

46:14.860 --> 46:15.240
Tiny.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.222
Did the librarians tell you about that?

46:17.242 --> 46:17.963
Yeah, I did.

46:17.983 --> 46:18.164
Read.

46:18.184 --> 46:18.864
Read, yeah.

46:19.205 --> 46:25.472
But the other thing is that one might be...

46:28.068 --> 46:30.591
Everett, with two Ts, L. Reed.

46:31.732 --> 46:32.853
This is the last copy.

46:33.034 --> 46:35.336
So they were getting rid of this.

46:36.337 --> 46:56.961
Now, I can't tell you how I would use this as a researcher, but I would want to respect the possibility that this book would be able to tell some future user of the library something about steel technology in 1929 that would be of value.

46:57.329 --> 47:01.114
And it's exactly the kind of book that you would want a great library the whole time.

47:01.135 --> 47:02.857
It's not even up to you to decide.

47:02.897 --> 47:04.119
You know, I mean, it has to be there.

47:04.159 --> 47:11.590
Ken Carpenter at Harvard told me, you know, I said, does it, do you have an idea of how soon a book, he used to buy books for the Kress Library.

47:12.571 --> 47:15.796
I said, do you apply a 10-year rule to a 20-year rule?

47:15.816 --> 47:23.607
Listen, when I was buying books for the Kress Library, I was buying 18th century books that were uncut, which means they hadn't been read in 200 years.

47:24.059 --> 47:30.647
He said, and I'm buying this book, and he said, the chances are it may not be read for another 200 years, but that's not the point.

47:31.028 --> 47:37.015
He said, the finest business school library in the world should have a copy of that book, and that's why I bought it, and it should be there.

47:37.556 --> 47:41.000
That's the criterion that you apply.

47:41.601 --> 47:53.155
If you're a sensible, he's buying, he sends stuff off to the Harvard Depository, which means outside of Cambridge, in stores, basically, that is brand new that he's buying right now.

47:53.675 --> 47:54.617
I said, you're kidding me.

47:54.637 --> 47:56.361
I said, brand new books that you're buying?

47:56.481 --> 47:56.982
You're sending?

47:57.082 --> 47:58.104
I said, how do you?

47:58.124 --> 48:06.362
He said, I was afraid that when I told people about that, they might say to me, then why buy the book if you know already that you're not going to use it?

48:06.382 --> 48:07.524
And he said, but you know what?

48:07.564 --> 48:08.646
Nobody raised it.

48:08.667 --> 48:09.388
Nobody whippered.

48:09.588 --> 48:11.010
If these are books, fine.

48:11.030 --> 48:14.475
There is no call for it, but that doesn't mean it's not a book we don't have to have.

48:14.515 --> 48:18.620
So they're buying books right now that they know that they're not going to use, and they're going straight to storage.

48:18.921 --> 48:22.566
Yeah, but even, you know, people like me page stuff from storage all the time.

48:22.786 --> 48:23.888
And it takes 24 hours.

48:23.988 --> 48:25.430
Right, big deal.

48:25.850 --> 48:29.175
Berkeley has a place called NRLF, which is, you know, wonderful.

48:29.515 --> 48:31.518
I mean, I get on a 24-hour cycle.

48:31.879 --> 48:32.820
I'm a big user.

48:33.180 --> 48:37.566
So it's not like it'll never be used, even if it's in remote storage.

48:37.907 --> 48:38.768
It's, you know...

48:39.136 --> 48:42.282
The problem with remote storage, however, is you have to know it's there.

48:42.302 --> 48:43.524
Yeah, yeah.

48:43.685 --> 48:48.594
And these places are, you know, stored with big boxes with one numerical code.

48:48.654 --> 48:49.275
It's barcoded.

48:49.496 --> 48:49.776
Yeah.

48:49.796 --> 48:54.485
The guy at the Harvard Depository says to me, if I had a Gutenberg Bible, it would have a barcode on it.

48:54.505 --> 48:56.048
I mean, I wouldn't know what was in the box.

48:56.348 --> 49:00.794
Everything comes barcoded, and it's strictly stored according to size.

49:01.936 --> 49:04.520
And the Library of Congress is doing that now.

49:04.700 --> 49:07.063
They're all following the Harvard model, by the way.

49:07.083 --> 49:09.447
The Harvard model itself goes something to see.

49:09.467 --> 49:12.591
I'm going to start a chapter out there in the depository.

49:12.691 --> 49:13.893
Great.

49:14.414 --> 49:18.019
The Valley of the Kings of Books, I call it.

49:19.180 --> 49:22.623
That's why we're talking about it.

49:22.763 --> 49:23.564
So let's go in.

49:23.584 --> 49:24.705
This is good, you know.

49:24.725 --> 49:26.307
But I like this.

49:26.367 --> 49:31.792
I bought this from the gift shop because this is what the actual card catalog looks like.

49:31.993 --> 49:33.534
Or no, it's been moved now.

49:33.554 --> 49:34.635
This is the old card catalog.

49:34.655 --> 49:35.416
That's still there.

49:36.697 --> 49:39.139
It was there when I... These are what, cards?

49:39.700 --> 49:41.542
This is the card catalog.

49:41.622 --> 49:42.743
What is this?

49:42.983 --> 49:45.806
Oh, these are gifty, shoppy kind of boxes.

49:46.567 --> 49:47.428
Cards?

49:47.448 --> 49:47.888
Yeah, cards.

49:48.273 --> 50:08.039
about the libraries that the most, well, I think I said that in the piece I read, that the most popular thing that the gift shop was selling back when the library opened was this little set of postcards, and each postcard was an image of a catalog card.

50:08.059 --> 50:11.644
And here's the other thing they chose to show was a picture, not of the new building.

50:12.024 --> 50:16.390
This is the actual old building with the old, this is the way it was decorated.

50:16.994 --> 50:18.416
It's a very ornate cocktail.

50:19.077 --> 50:21.761
I think it's now down in Brooks, but I'm not allowed to.

50:21.901 --> 50:25.246
I hope that's still for sale.

50:25.827 --> 50:27.529
Okay, we'll have some lunch.

50:27.549 --> 50:28.591
I hope so.

50:28.891 --> 50:32.116
You are locked down on the porch.

50:32.136 --> 50:32.616
Yeah.

50:32.636 --> 50:34.860
Okay, well then I'll put it on there.

50:34.980 --> 50:35.601
I'd love it.

50:35.621 --> 50:40.808
Do you mind if I sit down over here?

50:41.817 --> 50:44.781
I mean, you're a fiction writer.

50:44.961 --> 50:45.782
This is outside.

50:45.802 --> 50:51.609
You've written a lot of essays, and you write regularly for The New Yorker, and you certainly have written about life.

50:51.629 --> 50:55.614
I mean, this is not necessarily the kind of thing that you get involved in, right?

50:57.196 --> 51:07.909
No, but it turns out that I have this latent... Let's just grab some of this.

51:10.623 --> 51:19.251
there's certain things that I think are bad and wrong and that I can do something about them and I end up wanting to do it.

51:19.271 --> 51:20.352
So I didn't know that.

51:20.372 --> 51:29.661
I felt that I was going to be this apolitical kind of guy.

51:29.841 --> 51:40.191
But the books part is, you know, the card catalogs thing was what first sucked me in because I didn't, I really,

51:40.694 --> 51:53.228
I knew that my own research was going to be hurt if I was limited to the online catalog because I would be missing another way into the stacks, into the remote stacks.

51:53.328 --> 52:01.678
Now that books are stored off-site or enclosed stacks, you've got to have every possible avenue available.

52:01.698 --> 52:10.127
You've got to use bibliographies, footnotes in the back of articles, the web, news groups, friends.

52:10.343 --> 52:13.607
asking me, you know, what are the books that are important on this subject?

52:14.648 --> 52:21.597
And online catalogs, and also card catalogs, because they often have, you know, stuff you wouldn't find any other way.

52:22.017 --> 52:29.566
So I got really distressed about that.

52:29.586 --> 52:32.991
Did you tell your wife that I've seen Father Boyle in Italy?

52:33.011 --> 52:34.953
Yeah, that's cool.

52:36.255 --> 52:36.655
So, uh,

52:37.597 --> 52:38.979
He was at the Vatican.

52:39.279 --> 52:42.082
He was at the Vatican Library then, yeah.

52:42.222 --> 52:43.184
Yeah, oh yeah.

52:43.244 --> 52:44.525
He's the chief whatever.

52:45.306 --> 52:46.067
The prefect.

52:46.527 --> 52:47.128
That's what it's called.

52:47.148 --> 52:48.350
That's what it's called, yeah.

52:49.090 --> 52:50.853
Why don't you start?

52:54.096 --> 53:01.545
He had this true connoisseurial knowledge.

53:03.061 --> 53:09.227
Which is exactly why I've decided to open the institutional discussion.

53:09.988 --> 53:14.993
I'm going to define the context of that one with Harvard and Cornell.

53:16.494 --> 53:24.702
It would be very easy to start with... They don't want to pay somebody to be careful with the book.

53:26.884 --> 53:32.950
Xerox, I think, is working on a machine that would be able to take images without

53:34.415 --> 53:36.897
It would turn pages automatically.

53:37.158 --> 53:49.369
But the big hurdle with making copies of books that are bound is that you've got to pay somebody to put them carefully down on one of those angled Xerox machines and do it.

53:49.729 --> 53:53.093
But they've been doing that with microfilm for years, but it's expensive.

53:53.233 --> 53:57.016
I think the rule of thumb is that it costs a dollar a page to scan a book.

53:57.697 --> 53:58.598
That's right.

53:58.678 --> 53:59.318
Up or down?

53:59.619 --> 54:01.080
It's coming down a little bit.

54:01.516 --> 54:09.143
But so the cost, the labor intensiveness, and the cost of the processing costs are fabulously expensive.

54:09.163 --> 54:28.182
So my feeling is that they have to either wait until the costs come down, because the books aren't going to go anywhere as long as they're stored carefully on the shelf, or build into the scanning program, the digitalization program, a curatorial

54:28.482 --> 54:29.343
level of care.

54:30.004 --> 54:36.331
You can take a copy of that 18th century book without... They're not doing 18th century books.

54:36.351 --> 54:39.294
The ones that you saw that were all filleted.

54:39.315 --> 54:42.879
A lot of 19th century books.

54:43.319 --> 54:48.305
No, they're not doing that with any of the 18th century books.

54:49.086 --> 54:51.969
They're very responsible at Cornell.

54:54.212 --> 54:57.055
You and I have a different attitude, I think, but

54:57.946 --> 55:01.935
You can't fault them for the professional way they're going about it.

55:01.995 --> 55:04.000
I mean, everything's out front.

55:05.203 --> 55:08.831
And then, you know, digital... Then you look at what they did.

55:08.891 --> 55:11.277
I really went out there to look at the Cambodia project.

55:11.297 --> 55:13.963
This is, you know...
