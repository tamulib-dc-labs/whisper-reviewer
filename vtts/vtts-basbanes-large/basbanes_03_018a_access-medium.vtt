WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:04.941
So I haven't done any homework.

00:05.342 --> 00:06.544
Oh, okay.

00:06.564 --> 00:07.245
You're not supposed to.

00:07.265 --> 00:07.405
Good.

00:08.287 --> 00:08.527
All right.

00:08.547 --> 00:09.769
Let's just make sure that it's down there.

00:09.789 --> 00:10.290
We're running.

00:10.490 --> 00:11.332
Thank you very much.

00:11.792 --> 00:14.236
So you're finishing up Virgil now?

00:14.256 --> 00:16.961
I guess we'll... We're finishing up with a little premature.

00:17.762 --> 00:28.519
I hope to get what I'd call a working draft of the poem in just the poem itself by the end of summer or the beginning of fall after several years of work.

00:29.579 --> 00:33.103
But if I can get a working draft, that's when the hard hammering really begins.

00:33.124 --> 00:46.741
So I can't really say when it's going to be, and not least because I'm working with Bernard Knox, and Bernard is responsible as he was for the Iliad and the Odyssey, the introduction, the notes, the glossary.

00:47.942 --> 00:49.945
So it's still a way to go.

00:49.965 --> 00:59.417
This is really one of those extraordinary instances, I think, in recent literary history where the teacher, the mentor,

00:59.667 --> 01:02.651
continues to work so closely.

01:03.493 --> 01:04.194
I think you're right.

01:04.214 --> 01:05.396
I think it is unusual.

01:05.656 --> 01:09.261
And to speak from my point of view, it's an absolute blessing.

01:11.404 --> 01:17.333
My working relationship, my friendship with Bernard is one of the great privileges in my life.

01:18.795 --> 01:21.660
I count myself very fortunate indeed.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.903
Did you think of him as your primary reader?

01:24.490 --> 01:43.089
And I ask this with understanding, with the knowledge that you produce these magnificent translations which become bestsellers, which have resonance among a general readership, not just an academic or a scholarly.

01:43.109 --> 01:52.219
Well, one of the beauties of having Bernard as a reader, maybe one of the main readers, is that he knows the Greek text and now the Latin text by heart.

01:52.520 --> 01:59.026
But he also knows by heart the modern literature and what the demands of modern English might be.

01:59.046 --> 02:02.189
But Bernard is not my only reader.

02:03.370 --> 02:21.227
In fact, I turn often first to my wife, the muse herself, and to my children too, so that though I go to few readers at the outset, the spread of reader from the generalist to the specialist is pretty broad.

02:23.182 --> 02:35.638
And I've just been handing a draft of this book or that book out to some good friends I know who are as often as not poets and novelists as they are professional classicists.

02:36.459 --> 02:38.902
Again, I like to keep the base broad.

02:41.045 --> 02:42.306
Is there an ideal reader?

02:43.908 --> 02:50.176
Keeping in mind that you like to keep the base broad, but these are the readers of first resort, obviously.

02:50.196 --> 02:51.338
I think that's the way to put it.

02:51.358 --> 02:53.020
They are the readers of first resort.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.884
A handful of them.

02:56.726 --> 03:03.837
I think the ideal leader is somebody who's interested in this story and alive to the kind of life you're trying to lend this story.

03:04.978 --> 03:06.280
And I don't know how much it depends.

03:06.441 --> 03:11.649
I used to think it depended a great deal on education, even sociological background.

03:12.750 --> 03:20.442
But the more I see the way the Iliad and the Odyssey have caught on in many younger grades throughout the country,

03:21.147 --> 03:25.492
the less convinced I am that the audience has to be that elite or selective.

03:26.693 --> 03:30.077
So I still, I come out a strong believer in, quote, the common reader.

03:31.579 --> 03:39.008
And for all of the wringing of hands among specialists, that the literacy of the republic has gone to hell.

03:40.049 --> 03:43.233
I'm much encouraged by the literacy of the great republic.

03:44.514 --> 03:50.361
I think it's a lot broader, a lot healthier, a lot more inquisitive than many people have thought.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.171
Will it be?

03:52.352 --> 03:53.954
Will you be curious?

03:54.014 --> 03:59.480
I mean, your previous books, your best-known books, certainly were translations from the Greek.

04:00.061 --> 04:07.230
Now we're going into an area that some people regard as, you know, with quotation marks heavily around it, a dead language.

04:08.071 --> 04:13.598
Well, my answer to that is that there was a wonderful chairman of the classics department here, Jim Luce,

04:14.287 --> 04:19.913
who for years had a sign on his door saying, the only good language is a dead language.

04:19.933 --> 04:24.478
Stein John Wayne, which I think is pretty good.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.060
Is that an accurate quote of Wayne?

04:26.080 --> 04:26.961
Did he actually say that?

04:26.981 --> 04:27.401
No, no, no.

04:27.461 --> 04:32.026
He didn't say it, but it's the kind of thing he would say I'm afraid he would say is English.

04:32.046 --> 04:34.389
The only good language is a dead language.

04:34.409 --> 04:36.251
How did this professor spell his name?

04:36.271 --> 04:37.332
How do you see he?

04:38.293 --> 04:40.075
Lou James P.

04:40.240 --> 05:07.783
loose l-u-c yeah good okay that's uh you even quoted elsewhere you may even have mentioned to me when we spoke in 1997 that you that you often turn to modern poets poets for inspiration well if i can put it this way in front of me when i was in front of me on my desk as a translator i keep two big books the first big book is

05:08.101 --> 05:14.811
say the text of Homer or the text of Virgil, with all the lexicons and the commentaries.

05:14.831 --> 05:22.503
And on the other hand, and I mean the right hand, say, is the big book of modern verse, English verse.

05:22.523 --> 05:28.653
And I try to keep the two in tandem because I think I've got a dual kind of responsibility.

05:30.135 --> 05:33.400
One is to the ancient text and the other is to the modern reader.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.402
I try, as I say, to keep the two in balance.

05:37.422 --> 05:40.305
They don't always work in balance, but I do the best I can with that.

05:41.967 --> 05:54.181
Now, do you dip, or do you have specific poets who are... Well, some of the ones I read a lot are good friends of mine.

05:55.021 --> 06:00.147
Charlie Williams, Paul Muldoon, Dan Halperin,

06:02.489 --> 06:05.433
Seamus Heaney, who I'm getting to know and like even more.

06:05.453 --> 06:08.477
And of course, his Beowulf is another classic.

06:08.537 --> 06:10.840
A wonderful bestseller.

06:10.980 --> 06:13.544
Yeah, you talk about Beowulf as a bestseller.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.346
It's really quite astounding, isn't it?

06:15.366 --> 06:16.187
It is astounding.

06:16.728 --> 06:20.993
It's not so astounding that an Odyssey would be a bestseller, because the Odyssey's always been with us.

06:21.814 --> 06:25.860
But Beowulf has remained a little snarly and distant.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.722
But Seamus really brought it home.

06:28.623 --> 06:31.187
Now, this raises a question.

06:31.207 --> 06:32.108
With Seamus...

06:32.510 --> 06:34.953
a great poet in his own right.

06:36.035 --> 06:41.201
And for those who are not familiar with the Old English of Beowulf, I think it's Old English, right?

06:41.221 --> 06:42.643
It is, yeah.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.687
Does this become a new work of art?

06:45.767 --> 06:53.858
I think if a translation, it is really a serious piece of translation, becomes a new work of art.

06:53.878 --> 07:01.588
Becomes, that is, a new interpretation, an adaptation, a revision, sometimes drastically,

07:01.990 --> 07:04.133
sometimes very slight.

07:05.395 --> 07:07.198
But it's a transplant in some way.

07:07.218 --> 07:11.766
It's been carried over to a new language, a new time, a new culture.

07:11.786 --> 07:16.914
And I think that means invariably that it's not the same as the original was.

07:16.954 --> 07:20.680
The original becomes the translation.

07:20.700 --> 07:25.247
So those who don't speak Greek or don't speak Old English, and there are many of us,

07:26.442 --> 07:39.022
Well, I mean, I even read a piece, I forget where, but how the Scott Moncrief translation of Proust, for instance, to English-speaking readers, that's Proust.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.244
Yes, exactly.

07:40.885 --> 07:48.357
And Pope's Homer, done in the first part of the 18th century, was really Homer for about 150 years.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.662
A flawed Homer, in your view?

07:51.963 --> 07:52.323
Pardon me?

07:52.423 --> 07:53.445
A flawed Homer?

07:53.797 --> 07:55.399
Homer for its times.

07:55.419 --> 08:02.326
Well, I think of Homer for its many times, and I'm thinking of his Iliad rather than his Odyssey, which is a lesser production.

08:02.346 --> 08:11.837
But the Iliad is truly a great English poem of the stature of Milton's Paradise Lost, or Spencer's Fairy Queen, or Dryden's translation of Virgil's Aeneid.

08:13.038 --> 08:15.381
The great, sturdy English poems in their own right.

08:16.682 --> 08:21.728
Our mode of translation is much less radical than Pope's was, or Dryden's was.

08:22.552 --> 08:38.154
And we have an appreciation and respect for historicity, the so-called accuracy in Homer's portrayal of not his time, but a time about 500 years prior to him.

08:39.236 --> 08:42.541
That we stand much closer to the text, if we're translators.

08:43.362 --> 08:51.934
If we're bold adapters like Joyce, we can stand inside the text of Homer, or miles outside, all the way to Edwardian Dublin.

08:52.640 --> 08:59.028
But that's another kind of translation, and a very great one.

09:00.670 --> 09:05.696
I think you had mentioned earlier that you went to Amherst.

09:06.257 --> 09:11.544
I know you weren't intending to pursue a career in the classics, I guess.

09:11.744 --> 09:14.968
No, I entered Amherst in 51.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.898
And I was pre-med there for the first couple of years.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.941
You talk about a switch.

09:20.061 --> 09:20.781
God, that is a switch.

09:20.801 --> 09:21.382
It really is.

09:21.402 --> 09:24.585
But there have been a lot of poets who have been doctors and doctors who have been poets.

09:24.685 --> 09:26.427
Well, I'm seeing Robert Coles tomorrow morning.

09:26.668 --> 09:27.208
Oh, great.

09:27.669 --> 09:28.890
How lucky for the two of you.

09:29.430 --> 09:29.911
Yeah, thank you.

09:30.311 --> 09:32.233
But John Keats was an example.

09:32.253 --> 09:32.774
Exactly.

09:33.675 --> 09:35.957
So there's... William Carlos Williams.

09:35.977 --> 09:38.079
I'm Carlos Williams ever known as an obstetrician.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.242
Walker Percy, one of my favorites.

09:40.262 --> 09:41.083
Sure, you bet.

09:41.283 --> 09:41.563
So...

09:42.016 --> 09:52.372
I'm not sure what the literal connection is, but it seems to work, bringing something to birth in some way or other, or safeguarding some kind of life or vitality.

09:54.175 --> 10:03.829
And then there was a radical switch for me halfway through Amherst, and my love of language, love of literature caught up with me and wouldn't be put down.

10:05.151 --> 10:08.817
So when I entered my junior year of Amherst, I guess it was,

10:10.383 --> 10:12.748
I began to learn Greek, began to learn Latin.

10:13.049 --> 10:22.789
I came to those ancient languages late, but I went with what Vinnie Lombardius referred to as desire.

10:22.809 --> 10:24.493
I had a lot of it.

10:25.790 --> 10:29.874
Now, you learn these languages in courses at Amherst?

10:29.894 --> 10:30.315
That's right.

10:30.455 --> 10:30.735
Okay.

10:31.396 --> 10:37.122
And with the specific intention of being able to read these classics in their original languages?

10:37.142 --> 10:39.084
I think that's probably the nutshell.

10:39.184 --> 10:40.746
I think that's it in a nutshell.

10:41.487 --> 10:49.315
I had never had much exposure, if any, to classical literature or classical masterworks when I was in senior high school.

10:50.036 --> 10:52.759
My first exposure came in the first couple of years at Amherst.

10:53.414 --> 10:55.878
Well, we had, in effect, the great book sequence.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.222
And that was my first introduction.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.225
And I want to come back to that, by the way.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.507
Yeah, me too.

11:02.547 --> 11:04.150
Go ahead, please.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.934
And so my first exposure was through translation.

11:07.895 --> 11:12.161
I probably read, in fact, I know I read Latimer's Iliad.

11:12.181 --> 11:13.743
I'm not sure what Odyssey I would have read.

11:13.804 --> 11:17.889
It could have been Reuse Penguin Prose Version, an old standby.

11:19.472 --> 11:19.692
Uh...

11:20.347 --> 11:35.202
And I, like many others of my generation and generations to come, fell in love with these things through excellent translations and thought how wonderful it would be to get the beauty of it hot, to go back to the source itself.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.607
And so many of us began to learn those languages if we didn't have them before.

11:39.627 --> 11:46.033
And I don't think that I went at it with the desire of becoming a translator.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.695
I didn't know that at the time.

11:48.536 --> 11:49.797
But I simply wanted to come

11:49.996 --> 11:57.346
to get as close as I possibly could to Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, many other things, and Greek tragedy.

11:58.868 --> 12:00.170
That was my goal at that point.

12:01.612 --> 12:15.812
And it wasn't until a little later, I guess, this year when I was a graduate student in English, that it began to cross my mind, wouldn't it be wonderful at least to try to re-embody these things in my own language?

12:17.294 --> 12:19.918
That might be the greatest kind of...

12:20.388 --> 12:30.142
That would be the strongest demonstration of my affection for them, my affiliation with them, my feeling for them.

12:31.944 --> 12:36.130
Were you thinking of sharing this with others at this point, or was this merely for yourself?

12:38.013 --> 12:42.119
I think this was strictly for myself and for a drawer.

12:43.741 --> 12:45.764
I had no notion of how to share these things.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.488
I had no notion if I could do it in the first place.

12:49.463 --> 12:55.532
And it wasn't until a little later that I got up to gumption, some outrageous gumption.

12:55.953 --> 13:01.221
In fact, the first book I translated was a Greek-rated poet named Achilles.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.687
And they all brought it back into print, I'm glad to say.

13:05.908 --> 13:07.009
Oh, that's wonderful.

13:07.029 --> 13:12.197
They had published it in 61 and brought it back about half a dozen years ago or more.

13:13.139 --> 13:17.324
And how did this text survive most of them?

13:17.765 --> 13:21.269
It survived in a pot in Egypt and the Nile Delta.

13:21.389 --> 13:21.689
Wow.

13:22.210 --> 13:22.570
Yeah.

13:23.151 --> 13:25.374
In other words, by sheer dumb, blind luck.

13:25.394 --> 13:26.696
Is this one of those oxyrhynchus?

13:26.756 --> 13:31.001
No, it wasn't an oxyrhynchus, but it was really remote.

13:32.543 --> 13:33.484
Very remote.

13:34.545 --> 13:36.407
And it's one of those... One of those miracles.

13:36.447 --> 13:37.529
Yeah, one of those miracles.

13:37.729 --> 13:38.530
Exactly.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.053
Sometimes we're treated to those miracles.

13:41.438 --> 13:44.062
and think how many miracles we've lacked along the way.

13:44.302 --> 13:44.883
Exactly.

13:47.606 --> 13:48.548
But that was the first.

13:50.831 --> 14:02.507
And I went at it for the very simple reasons that I'd fallen in love with the poetry in Greek and wanted to see if I could turn it into English.

14:02.887 --> 14:08.114
My translations from Homer begin really, as a matter of fact, with my mother's death.

14:09.296 --> 14:10.838
She died in 76.

14:12.657 --> 14:18.904
And it fell to me as it falls to many of us to put together a program of readings of some sort for friends, relatives, whatever.

14:20.126 --> 14:32.760
And the first text that left to mind was that marvelous scene in the 11th book of the Odyssey, where Odysseus confronts the ghost of his mother, tries to embrace her three times and fails, and his heart is broken.

14:33.902 --> 14:37.065
That's the text that came to mind, the first one I wanted to read.

14:37.986 --> 14:41.871
I hadn't translated it myself, and I was too discombobulated at that point.

14:42.644 --> 14:46.810
try my hand at it, so I went to Robert Fitzgerald's wonderful version of it and read that.

14:48.152 --> 14:53.939
Then in the few weeks following, when I began to gather myself again, I tried my own hand at it.

14:55.401 --> 15:01.149
And that was when and where I began to translate Homer.

15:01.169 --> 15:02.231
I'm sorry.

15:02.251 --> 15:03.833
No, that's all right.

15:03.853 --> 15:08.199
Are there days where you actually will labor an entire day over the choice of a single word?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.542
There's always that kind of day.

15:11.298 --> 15:15.076
And is that word worth it, in your view?

15:15.598 --> 15:17.085
If you hit it, it's worth it.

15:17.748 --> 15:19.637
If you miss it, it breaks the heart.

15:20.056 --> 15:21.918
But you only discovered that afterwards, right?

15:21.938 --> 15:22.339
Oh, sure.

15:22.379 --> 15:26.563
I remember somebody was questioning you about the way you opened the Iliad, you know, rage.

15:26.583 --> 15:27.324
Yes, that's right.

15:28.205 --> 15:32.029
And how you were just filled with so many anxious moments.

15:32.049 --> 15:35.693
I mean, we talked about the foundation poem of Western civilization.

15:35.713 --> 15:37.996
And it begins with anger rather than rationality.

15:38.016 --> 15:39.477
But you thought that out, didn't you?

15:39.698 --> 15:41.480
I had to fight that out, yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.168
And in fact, that was one case in which the English translator has some love that the Greek

15:49.790 --> 15:53.174
The original Greek is not.

15:53.895 --> 15:59.222
The first word of the Iliad is manin, from which we get mania, or rage.

16:00.904 --> 16:08.673
And in English, rather than in Greek, in English that can become a noun, or it can become an imperative.

16:09.754 --> 16:12.218
And I use it both ways in the first word of that poem.

16:12.778 --> 16:13.179
Rage.

16:14.120 --> 16:14.901
Sing the rage.

16:15.482 --> 16:18.345
Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus son Achilles.

16:18.848 --> 16:24.474
In other words, let rage be your subject, and you go ahead and rage at the same time, please.

16:25.696 --> 16:27.157
So it's both of urban and noun.

16:27.978 --> 16:35.366
It's not that in classical Greek or Homeric Greek, but it is in English, and I thought that was the only way I could do it.

16:36.067 --> 16:44.957
Would it help you as a scholar to know when you're dealing with other people who interest you what their reading habits are or what...

16:45.190 --> 17:07.940
I think it would help.

17:08.221 --> 17:15.130
It would help me to understand a better notion of what general literacy is in the United States

17:15.295 --> 17:16.537
at the turn of the millennium.

17:17.879 --> 17:22.746
At the same time, I could get stuck badly, too.

17:22.766 --> 17:31.679
In other words, if I found out, and I wouldn't be surprised if I did find out, that Shakespeare was on the minds or ears of many, I might be tempted to imitate Shakespeare.

17:32.901 --> 17:35.605
And that would be a dead end if there ever was one, for me at least.

17:36.366 --> 17:40.712
So there are certain risks... That's right.

17:41.890 --> 17:45.254
I have a good friend who translates from Russian, Clarence Brown.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.778
And we had talked about this kind of thing.

17:49.519 --> 17:52.283
And he asked me, Bob, are there any dangerous poets?

17:53.384 --> 17:56.308
I said, what do you mean by dangerous poets, C.B., Clarence?

17:57.469 --> 18:04.318
I said poets who are so close to what you ought to do that if you get too close to them, you end up imitating them.

18:05.599 --> 18:07.982
And I think that Shakespeare would be that danger for me.

18:08.924 --> 18:14.009
And so I've always given Shakespeare a wide berth when it comes to my work as a translator.

18:15.170 --> 18:16.732
As a reader, I'm reading him all the time.

18:17.452 --> 18:23.678
I want to find him that dangerous in terms of posing a danger to those who read.

18:23.698 --> 18:25.560
Well, I think there's no question of that.

18:25.881 --> 18:35.210
Blake said of the classics, but with pointed reference to Homer, it is the classics, the classics that desolate Europe with wars.

18:36.151 --> 18:37.132
Blake said that.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.593
Yeah, and I think he...

18:39.130 --> 18:41.172
I think he saw something very clearly.

18:42.113 --> 18:50.121
There are certain poems which are dangerous poems that tend to let loose sources of human energy which are often ungoverned.

18:50.141 --> 18:51.502
Can you think of a few examples?

18:51.643 --> 18:52.604
Yeah, Homer's Iliad.

18:53.945 --> 18:56.347
I think Homer's Iliad is a real dangerous poem.

18:57.569 --> 19:03.575
Unless you read it all, and I don't mean all 24 books, I mean if you respond to every aspect of it.

19:04.656 --> 19:05.897
Because if you do...

19:06.468 --> 19:16.445
then I think you begin to feel that Homer's Iliad is a cruel poem, a relentlessly cruel poem, but it's also a very compassionate one.

19:16.465 --> 19:26.802
And there must be some symbiosis going on there between the ferocity of the poetry and the feeling of compassion that it often rouses in people.

19:28.084 --> 19:32.391
It's that old paradox which is, I think, always with us.

19:33.164 --> 19:39.134
Remember the refrain in Yeats's Easter 1916, All change changed utterly.

19:39.154 --> 19:41.277
A terrible beauty is born.

19:41.577 --> 19:42.579
Terrible beauty, yeah.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.320
Terrible beauty.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.664
That phrase summarizes it all, I think.

19:46.525 --> 19:48.128
The Iliad is a terrible beauty.

19:49.210 --> 19:52.675
Whether both things are held in tandem and are equal forces, I'm not sure.

19:53.436 --> 19:54.899
But one gives rise to the other.

19:56.381 --> 19:59.526
Do you think it's this terrible beauty then, partially at least?

19:59.810 --> 20:02.614
that explains the seductive power of that poem.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.518
I mean, I think it's got to be the most translated poem over the years.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.641
I think that's probably true, Nate.

20:07.661 --> 20:09.884
And I do think it has a great deal to do with its appeal.

20:10.945 --> 20:18.976
I might almost say, whether we know it or not, there's a tremendous forward drive in that poem.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.879
There's an engine driving that poem.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.224
And it's not all toward cruelty.

20:25.025 --> 20:26.627
It's toward human feeling, too.

20:27.383 --> 20:36.041
For people who suggest that, I mean, again, to go back to the horrible phrase, a dead language, Latin is not taught anymore.

20:36.181 --> 20:38.546
Greek is hardly ever taught anymore.

20:39.307 --> 20:48.025
And then you wonder why when you read Lincoln, you see him quoting Roman authors.

20:48.325 --> 20:49.026
Sure do.

20:49.186 --> 20:49.887
And Jefferson.

20:49.907 --> 20:51.808
And Jefferson and Emerson.

20:51.889 --> 20:52.329
All of them.

20:52.349 --> 20:54.211
And all of them.

20:54.231 --> 20:56.213
And are we missing that today?

20:56.253 --> 21:00.417
And yet I ask, do the classics still resonate today?

21:00.437 --> 21:01.358
Oh, I certainly think so.

21:01.378 --> 21:02.239
I think more and more.

21:02.259 --> 21:13.910
And it may be that I'm speaking from a very privileged institution, but there's no shortage among the people I've taught for more than 40 years here at Princeton.

21:14.631 --> 21:17.674
No, no shortage of people who

21:18.160 --> 21:23.146
either come equipped with some classical language or are hungry for it.

21:23.166 --> 21:28.452
And I think it goes beyond Princeton.

21:29.193 --> 21:30.515
I find it on my email.

21:30.575 --> 21:33.619
I find it in my first-class mail.

21:33.759 --> 21:43.751
Readers from afar, in some far north of this country, want a guy who rode a bicycle 40 miles to get to the public library to read my Odyssey.

21:43.851 --> 21:45.653
I'm assuming myself, I'm talking about

21:46.088 --> 21:52.213
his hunger to get acquainted with that poem, other gestures like that, actions like that.

21:52.233 --> 21:55.556
I don't think it's limited to Princeton University.

21:56.617 --> 22:09.608
I think there's a lot of hunger, inquisitiveness, curiosity, and it may even suggest that what they have as common fare for reading doesn't satisfy them quite as much as something classical may.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.550
At least they're willing to give it a try.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.353
And they're willing to give it a try in great and encouraging numbers,

22:15.974 --> 22:18.678
I find it one of the most heartening experiences I've ever had.

22:20.802 --> 22:24.348
You know, that people are reading these things.

22:24.368 --> 22:29.276
You used a phrase in the New York Times interview with Mel Cusso.

22:29.496 --> 22:30.398
What so?

22:30.418 --> 22:31.159
In 1997.

22:31.640 --> 22:38.571
You're not mocking, but certainly mindful of the actions of the translation police.

22:38.591 --> 22:38.691
Yeah.

22:39.262 --> 22:42.545
And I wonder if you could give me a little riff on that, what you were driving at there.

22:42.565 --> 22:44.627
Well, I better not stress that too much unless they get me.

22:45.889 --> 22:54.137
I think that there are some people who regard translation as a word-by-word enterprise.

22:54.157 --> 23:09.252
In other words, they will tend to judge a translation on whether the translation captures this word or that word out of 10,000 words and fail, I think, to see the overall picture that a translator is trying to draw

23:10.193 --> 23:23.607
the big work and verse paragraphs, the shape he or she will give to an entire book in Homer, the tone of speech that you adopt in translating Nestor on the one hand, Helen of Troy on the other.

23:23.627 --> 23:30.054
In other words, it's a forest, it's a trees for forest problem.

23:30.195 --> 23:38.023
I think it can be a tendency to get lost in the individual branches and not see the forest whole.

23:39.016 --> 23:53.864
And if translation is as original or originating an activity as I like to think it is, then you owe it to the serious translation to take the whole sweep of it.

23:55.226 --> 23:58.112
Get the feeling of the entire piece of work.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.957
The translation police, by the way, are extremely valuable.

24:01.814 --> 24:09.483
because they help me at any rate, so far as I know them or sense them in the darkness.

24:10.604 --> 24:19.074
They help me know that I have a real responsibility to an ancient text, to be as close to it, as accurate as I can possibly be.

24:20.255 --> 24:24.280
At the same time, I want to express a modern vision of it.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.564
So some of my best friends are translation policemen.

24:27.584 --> 24:31.028
That's a great quote, by the way, especially for me, where you

24:31.261 --> 24:47.943
The fidelity that you feel, the obligation, the responsibility to the original text, you are making a work that you hope, you are creating a work that you hope is accessible to modern audiences.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.969
By the way, I have the transcript of the interview that you and I had in IT.E.

24:52.029 --> 24:53.411
Oh, I like that.

24:53.431 --> 24:56.335
And if you don't mind, I will draw from that as well.

24:56.515 --> 24:57.977
Ew.

24:58.295 --> 25:07.207
There are a lot of questions that I would have been asking you today that we went over seven years ago, and you answered beautifully, and I'm assuming those answers still apply today, right?

25:07.247 --> 25:07.708
I bet they do.

25:07.788 --> 25:08.068
Yeah.

25:08.589 --> 25:10.291
I mean, you know, anytime you like.

25:10.552 --> 25:16.860
Yeah, well, I mean, for instance, one question, which the great book, great book,

25:17.178 --> 25:39.118
um item that you you raised a few minutes ago we kind of touched on in that earlier interview when i asked you how you feel when you hear that a college like hammers where you where you went to school or even princeton or brown they don't require don't require english majors you know to study shakespeare or spencer or or milton

25:39.098 --> 25:41.121
And you responded, well, you certainly hope.

25:41.141 --> 25:43.965
But the question is, have you read Shakespeare?

25:44.005 --> 25:45.086
Have you read Spencer?

25:45.587 --> 25:50.855
You know, the greater question is, I mean, when we get a student at this level, sure, we don't require it.

25:51.035 --> 25:53.518
We require it, but we certainly expect it.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.403
We certainly hope like hell for it.

25:56.423 --> 25:57.584
We hope like hell for it.

25:57.845 --> 26:03.132
But can you imagine somebody getting a degree in English literature?

26:03.382 --> 26:05.084
who hasn't read Shakespeare?

26:05.144 --> 26:07.508
I guess it can be done, and I don't want to think of it.

26:07.568 --> 26:09.450
But it's a horrible thought, isn't it?

26:09.470 --> 26:10.692
It is a horrible thought.

26:10.812 --> 26:12.014
What are the underpinnings?

26:12.034 --> 26:15.038
What is the notion of the source of their language they speak?

26:15.058 --> 26:19.725
But then you think about the translation police, but then there are also the culture police.

26:19.845 --> 26:20.406
Absolutely.

26:20.926 --> 26:30.159
And then I guess this does kind of segue you nicely into the whole great book's core question, and I wonder how you weigh in on that.

26:31.301 --> 26:32.342
I think it's essential.

26:33.031 --> 26:35.674
And I think that we should not worry too much about the canon.

26:37.276 --> 26:38.717
The canon will always be shifting.

26:38.737 --> 26:40.019
The canon is something living.

26:40.119 --> 26:40.719
It's growing.

26:41.180 --> 26:41.881
It's not steady.

26:41.921 --> 26:42.441
It's stable.

26:43.562 --> 26:47.347
And worry more on the effectiveness with which these great things are taught.

26:48.748 --> 26:51.111
We can always quarrel about what titles should be included.

26:51.972 --> 26:55.515
But what you can't quarrel about, I think, is the figure with which these things are felt.

26:56.036 --> 26:56.977
That word was bigger?

26:57.317 --> 26:57.618
Bigger.

26:57.778 --> 26:58.339
Bigger.

26:58.359 --> 26:58.459
Okay.

26:58.479 --> 26:59.680
In which they're felt.

27:01.432 --> 27:03.579
Transmitted, I might as well say translated.

27:05.986 --> 27:11.905
I'll tell you, there was an interview with me by Chris Hedges in the New York Times not so long ago.

27:12.125 --> 27:12.466
April?

27:13.229 --> 27:13.991
Yes, April.

27:14.152 --> 27:14.874
I have it, yeah.

27:14.894 --> 27:15.255
Okay.

27:15.522 --> 27:19.466
And again, I'm not covering territory that you cover because... Oh, feel free.

27:19.566 --> 27:20.947
Well, I mean, you've got it there.

27:21.388 --> 27:25.712
I mean, you've covered it, and I'm trying to get to areas that I don't have.

27:25.732 --> 27:26.112
Please do.

27:26.293 --> 27:27.514
Please do.

27:27.674 --> 27:34.661
But the great book's curriculum, the great book's debate... Yes.

27:35.241 --> 27:41.327
So you do... I come down very heavily, see, in favor of it.

27:41.347 --> 27:41.968
And...

27:42.725 --> 27:48.633
I suppose when it comes to the choice of particular titles, particular translations, there's a great deal of room for debate.

27:49.614 --> 28:00.570
But I think it's awfully important, especially for younger people, to realize that when they read a writer of the stature of James Joyce, say, there's something beyond that.

28:01.451 --> 28:07.219
James Joyce is part of a great unfolding tradition of, say, adaptations of Homer.

28:09.161 --> 28:12.546
And it gives you a feeling of continuity with the past, of where you come from.

28:12.914 --> 28:26.973
It also may open your eyes, as a young reader, to the struggle that it represents to be a writer, to get words down on paper, to see the sweat involved, to see the originality involved, the pressure.

28:28.775 --> 28:35.104
You know, when you mention James Joyce and you mention Ulysses, of course, this was the 100th year of Bloomsday.

28:35.144 --> 28:35.905
It was.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.348
And there were fabulous stories, which I...

28:38.665 --> 28:43.189
Google, I have to say, is something you could just do a search and see what they're saying all over the world.

28:43.269 --> 28:43.710
Isn't it wonderful?

28:43.730 --> 28:46.112
All over the world, you know, about Bloomsday or whatever.

28:46.633 --> 28:49.395
You know, seeing what they've been saying about Fahrenheit 9-11.

28:49.415 --> 28:50.917
You're not going to have a fault like that.

28:50.937 --> 28:51.257
All of it.

28:52.919 --> 28:53.900
Very, very interesting.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.423
My daughter and I were among those who started an opening day, by the way.

28:57.463 --> 29:00.786
And I want to see what's going on.

29:01.727 --> 29:07.913
But when we think of Joyce and Ulysses, one little nugget that came out from

29:08.365 --> 29:24.931
maybe 25 different stories that I read is that this is easily the most celebrated literary day in the world on the one hand, and yet perhaps four or five percent of the people, if that many, who are celebrating it haven't read the book.

29:24.951 --> 29:27.194
It's a wonderful thing in some ways.

29:27.214 --> 29:29.338
I wish that everyone would read the book always.

29:29.418 --> 29:31.541
I'm a reader and a writer and a teacher.

29:32.222 --> 29:36.769
But it's wonderful that a book can still gain that kind of prestige and preeminence.

29:37.323 --> 29:39.286
even if it's based on ignorance.

29:39.306 --> 29:53.408
I don't want to peddle ignorance, but I guess what we retain is a kind of belief in the authority of print, which is not a bad thing, as long as the print is holding something well-written, well-thought-out.

29:53.978 --> 29:57.241
on the side of the better angels rather than the worse.

29:57.261 --> 30:00.364
Well, and I guess there is a parallel question here.

30:00.384 --> 30:17.100
When we talk about the role of the translator as the interpreter, as the filter between the reader and the original text, you wonder almost if... I did an interview with Norman Mailer many years ago, and I forget how Joyce came up.

30:17.120 --> 30:21.724
He was quoting Joyce and Ulysses, and I asked him,

30:21.704 --> 30:23.506
something about the novel.

30:23.546 --> 30:25.868
Well, to tell you the truth, I haven't read the novel.

30:26.088 --> 30:29.512
All I know about it, he said, is what I get from Elman.

30:29.972 --> 30:31.393
But that's not bad.

30:32.014 --> 30:36.438
But again, as you say, we are relying on a filter here, aren't we?

30:36.458 --> 30:36.919
We are.

30:36.939 --> 30:41.583
And it means that the filter has an awesome kind of responsibility about him or her.

30:42.404 --> 30:49.551
And I often feel, I often wonder while I'm working on a Virgil or a Homer or a Sophocles, who the devil am I to be

30:50.138 --> 30:51.659
to put my hands on these things.

30:53.641 --> 31:05.093
There's an almost embarrassing kind of arrogance involved in it, as well as the opposite feeling of being chastened and humbled by the greatness of what you're trying to deal with.

31:05.153 --> 31:13.441
So there's a great weight of responsibility and a great buoyancy of spirit, too.

31:14.722 --> 31:17.665
The more I work with Homer and especially the battle scenes, I think,

31:18.353 --> 31:22.559
The more I was struck by this weight of responsibility, the more painful it became.

31:22.599 --> 31:27.605
And yet at the same time, the more uplifting, ennobling it became as well.

31:27.625 --> 31:29.208
It was a terrible beauty.

31:30.129 --> 31:31.751
I was experiencing a terrible beauty.

31:31.771 --> 31:32.372
That's wonderful.

31:32.692 --> 31:33.754
Line by line.

31:33.774 --> 31:35.536
We did talk about Beowulf.

31:35.556 --> 31:36.317
I think we did.

31:36.658 --> 31:37.559
We talked about Proust.

31:38.140 --> 31:41.084
What was that one?

31:41.104 --> 31:41.444
Oh, yeah.

31:41.684 --> 31:45.670
An interview I had with Helen Wendler a couple of weeks ago.

31:45.690 --> 31:47.432
And my question for Helen was...

31:47.800 --> 31:48.522
Good people.

31:49.464 --> 31:52.229
Christopher Ricks, we're talking about Robert Coles.

31:52.310 --> 31:56.418
I'm so excited about the lineup of people.

31:56.699 --> 31:58.843
Just people that I have total respect for.

31:59.084 --> 32:03.413
And the beauty of you is that

32:03.393 --> 32:06.838
You know, we've had several conversations over a period of years.

32:06.898 --> 32:09.643
Harold Bloom, I've done four interviews with over the years.

32:09.703 --> 32:11.646
Have you seen what's changed in Harold?

32:12.086 --> 32:22.502
You know, I haven't seen him in about four years, so I'm about to set that one up, and I was just going through the transcripts for those interviews, and I've kept them all over 30 years.

32:22.582 --> 32:24.285
I bet you did.

32:24.305 --> 32:26.148
They really are good.

32:26.328 --> 32:29.012
A couple of universities want them, which is kind of interesting.

32:29.262 --> 32:30.283
kind of encouraging.

32:30.303 --> 32:35.829
But Helen, I asked Helen, how does a canon come to be formed?

32:36.270 --> 32:39.313
Who is it that decides that something is... Who are the umpires?

32:39.433 --> 32:40.214
Who are the umpires?

32:40.234 --> 32:41.476
And she said other writers.

32:41.496 --> 32:43.298
I think that is also true.

32:44.038 --> 32:48.684
At the same time, I wouldn't want to leave it only to the writers.

32:48.764 --> 32:54.510
Or rather, I wouldn't want to leave out the great readers either.

32:55.435 --> 33:01.401
I've got two daughters who are wonderful readers, but they don't want to study literature.

33:02.102 --> 33:04.184
One's a doctor and the other's a marketing analyst.

33:05.125 --> 33:16.117
They remain among the best readers I've ever met, and their reactions to my work are very precious, not simply because I'm a doting father, but because they have a freshness about them.

33:17.378 --> 33:21.022
They don't have many filters between themselves and the book itself.

33:21.743 --> 33:23.164
They can come at it head on.

33:24.207 --> 33:51.261
not deflected by this scholarship or that school or whatever and uh there are many people i've met many great readers in my day my wife is a great reader first and foremost she is the great reader and she's full of responses to what she's reading um maybe you could just define in your view what makes a great reader i think

33:53.165 --> 33:55.569
Let me quote you a phrase from Virginia Woolf.

33:56.931 --> 34:01.738
Virginia Woolf wrote a wonderful essay which you may know called On Not Knowing Greek.

34:02.639 --> 34:08.268
I forget if it's in the first common reader or the second common reader, but we can find it if we need it.

34:08.288 --> 34:13.496
And she says of the people in Homer about the lives they lead.

34:13.516 --> 34:16.320
This may seem a roundabout way of answering your question, but I'll get there.

34:17.093 --> 34:21.417
He says, and I don't have it in front of me, I'm quoting from memory.

34:21.517 --> 34:22.478
And not to worry.

34:22.498 --> 34:22.878
Okay.

34:22.938 --> 34:33.347
With down to the sea in their ears, vines, meadows, rivulets around them, they are even more aware than we are of a ruthless fate.

34:34.408 --> 34:39.412
There is a sadness at the back of life which they do not attempt to mitigate.

34:39.432 --> 34:46.138
Entirely aware of their own standing in the shadow, and yet alive to every tremor and gleam of existence,

34:46.709 --> 34:47.750
There they endure.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.132
That's vintage Virginia.

34:50.873 --> 34:52.094
It's Homer through and through.

34:52.114 --> 34:55.998
And it helps me define or suggest what the ideal reader is.

34:57.600 --> 35:04.867
Entirely aware of our own standing in the shadow and yet alive to every tremor and gleam of existence.

35:04.887 --> 35:05.708
There they endure.

35:06.388 --> 35:10.212
That being alive to every tremor and gleam of existence.

35:10.232 --> 35:12.294
That's what a great reader has in plenty, I think.

35:13.435 --> 35:15.197
A great writer does too, of course.

35:15.768 --> 35:17.470
But I don't think it should be limited to writers.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.172
I think there are readers who have this.

35:19.252 --> 35:27.441
And then before I interrupt you, just swing back to where you were talking about your reliance on your wife and your daughters as great readers and the formation of canons.

35:27.461 --> 35:28.522
And I know I interrupted you.

35:28.582 --> 35:29.303
I apologize.

35:29.323 --> 35:30.224
No, no, no.

35:30.244 --> 35:32.166
I didn't want to lose that thought on the great reader.

35:32.627 --> 35:36.571
If you might, just continuing with that thought that you had.

35:36.591 --> 35:36.771
For sure.

35:37.532 --> 35:44.880
I think that you form a canon, a writer will form a canon probably based on the writers who have helped him.

35:45.113 --> 35:46.899
been most influential to him or her.

35:48.063 --> 35:56.912
A reader in some ways may have less of an axe to grind, may be less utilitarian about what

35:57.517 --> 35:59.340
He or she is leaning.

35:59.420 --> 36:00.481
Carrying less baggage.

36:00.802 --> 36:01.262
That's good.

36:01.363 --> 36:03.325
Whose phrase is that?

36:04.147 --> 36:06.009
I don't know whose it is.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.416
Better than grinding, actually.

36:10.476 --> 36:13.881
You're bringing nothing to the table except your own interests.

36:13.941 --> 36:14.522
That's right.

36:15.223 --> 36:17.506
You're not trying to bully the text in the submission.

36:18.147 --> 36:21.111
You're not trying to squeeze it to get a piece of your own workout.

36:21.935 --> 36:32.075
Or it's when some publication engages another translator to do a review of one of your books, especially when it works in Greek.

36:32.275 --> 36:32.736
That's right.

36:33.377 --> 36:34.078
Exactly.

36:34.439 --> 36:36.964
Well, what are they bringing to the table here?

36:37.846 --> 36:39.248
Exactly.

36:39.308 --> 36:43.757
And so you do have to have, and I as a reader, an appreciative

36:44.041 --> 36:48.646
reader of reviews, but always with qualifications and reservations.

36:48.666 --> 36:49.367
That's right.

36:49.407 --> 36:50.969
You know, what's the subtext here?

36:50.989 --> 36:51.269
Sure.

36:51.649 --> 36:52.490
What's going on?

36:53.531 --> 37:04.784
I think to follow up Helen's good suggestion, however, it'd be interesting, and maybe it's been done many times, to pick ten or dozen writers and have them, each of them, submit a canon.

37:05.545 --> 37:13.153
There's half a dozen things that they would like to be, what is it, on a desert island with, on one's deathbed with,

37:13.522 --> 37:31.607
and so forth, the ultimate choices that they would make, and see the differences between the canon submitted by each of those ten a dozen writers, see what they have in common, what they don't have in common, what their choices say about their own work and their own hopes for an audience.

37:31.628 --> 37:32.649
Firstly, just a thing.

37:33.670 --> 37:41.942
But I do think that canon formation should lie not only in the hands of the creator, but in the hands of the receiver, too.

37:42.260 --> 37:46.764
I'm just finishing a chapter that I've had the greatest fun with in this new book.

37:46.925 --> 37:49.418
This is the first book that I'm

37:49.752 --> 37:52.797
researching and writing at the same time.

37:52.817 --> 37:53.598
It's kind of fun.

37:53.618 --> 38:00.069
And of course, there's always ample opportunity to go back and to rethink and to revise.

38:00.089 --> 38:07.120
But I'm writing one chapter where I begin with the great Printing in the Mind of Man exhibition in England in 1963.

38:07.240 --> 38:13.030
And of course, these were all books that were perceived to have changed the world.

38:13.230 --> 38:16.435
It really did give me the premise for this book.

38:16.415 --> 38:23.982
And so I decided to see how many different exhibitions or books that I could find where they have put together these lists.

38:24.002 --> 38:29.928
You know, the Malcolm Cowley book, 1937 books that shaped the way we think.

38:29.948 --> 38:37.635
The Groyer Club, 100 most influential books in America prior to 1900, you know.

38:38.115 --> 38:41.739
But there was one book I found, an obscure book in a second-hand bookstore.

38:41.759 --> 38:43.080
I paid $2 for it.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.687
And it's the greatest books of our time, published in 1926.

38:46.707 --> 38:50.354
And it's the first quarter of the 20th century.

38:50.735 --> 38:56.226
And he said, no book can get in here unless it has at least four sponsors.

38:56.830 --> 39:01.737
and the sponsors are the reviews, and they have famous critics of the period.

39:01.877 --> 39:06.143
And he gives us a thousand books, and he gives even little snippets of the reviews.

39:06.163 --> 39:15.076
He even gives you the number of votes, the various... But would you be amazed at the books that you would never even know exist today?

39:15.336 --> 39:21.545
And then you see down at the bottom people like Proust, people like Einstein.

39:22.206 --> 39:22.927
It's astonishing.

39:22.947 --> 39:25.150
And I wrote this up, and again...

39:25.130 --> 39:26.251
like the classics.

39:26.512 --> 39:27.393
That's quite fascinating.

39:27.493 --> 39:29.436
I think we need time, you know.

39:29.456 --> 39:29.836
We do.

39:30.096 --> 39:33.080
And it's not just other writers giving their approbation.

39:33.100 --> 39:33.461
Not at all.

39:33.481 --> 39:36.124
It's really what does survive over the long haul.

39:36.265 --> 39:36.545
It does.

39:36.565 --> 39:38.207
And it's not only in the hands of the artists.

39:39.088 --> 39:39.228
It is.

39:39.649 --> 39:41.752
Isn't that, I hadn't thought of that.

39:41.772 --> 39:45.096
It should be in the hands of artists, true, but why not statesmen?

39:45.076 --> 39:47.380
Why not physicians?

39:47.400 --> 39:50.605
We've talked about the ligature between medicine and literature.

39:50.645 --> 39:53.650
That's really one of the reasons I want to talk to Coles again tomorrow.

39:53.730 --> 39:54.090
I would.

39:54.110 --> 39:55.693
He'd be an expert at that.

39:55.773 --> 39:56.554
And he really is.

39:57.416 --> 40:00.340
But this has been a lot of fun, that particular chapter to write.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.063
I'm just wrapping it up.

40:02.263 --> 40:07.692
And then there was this great Roger exhibition where the committee was supposed to come up with 100 books.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.801
They couldn't agree.

40:08.881 --> 40:14.027
I mean, they agreed on the Declaration of Independence, on the Gettysburg Address.

40:14.067 --> 40:14.908
The Gettysburg Address.

40:14.948 --> 40:17.631
And the second inaugural, I hope.

40:17.651 --> 40:23.778
Well, no, not the second inaugural, but you know they had in there not the Sears Roebuck catalog.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.941
These are the most influential books.

40:25.961 --> 40:28.243
Not the greatest, but the most influential.

40:28.263 --> 40:29.905
Well, I guess maybe that's the point, too.

40:30.366 --> 40:32.548
Forget the arguments about title by title.

40:32.900 --> 40:37.927
and simply get on your knees in front of the influence of the text itself, or a text itself.

40:38.168 --> 40:38.708
Exactly.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.170
It's a great tribute to literacy.

40:41.152 --> 40:47.882
You know, we've done about 45 minutes, and I think that I don't want you to lose your voice entirely.

40:47.982 --> 40:48.743
I enjoy this very much.

40:48.763 --> 40:55.212
What I would like to do is to transcribe this, absorb it, to take a look at it, and collate it with my other stuff.

40:55.495 --> 40:59.180
And then perhaps get back to you at some point.

40:59.200 --> 41:03.046
And if you have another three quarters of an hour, if you don't mind, we can pick up.

41:03.466 --> 41:05.930
We'll find because I find this very interesting and a lot of fun.

41:06.190 --> 41:08.153
This has been fabulous.

41:08.293 --> 41:11.918
So please give me a call when you're in shape to do a little more work together.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.200
Sounds wonderful, sir.

41:13.433 --> 41:18.762
Please, and by all means, if you think that we ought to meet head-to-head... I'd like to do that, actually.

41:18.782 --> 41:20.404
I do want to come down to that.

41:20.464 --> 41:24.171
I've not yet met Elaine Pagels, and I believe... Oh, you must do that.

41:24.191 --> 41:25.292
She's a great person.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.456
You wouldn't know she's around this summer.

41:27.476 --> 41:30.060
I just saw her last night than the night before.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.182
Oh, good, so she is around.

41:31.442 --> 41:34.027
I think that she's around this summer, but I can't swear to it.

41:34.227 --> 41:34.628
Excellent.

41:34.648 --> 41:37.973
So what I will try to do is arrange something with her...

41:38.223 --> 41:41.641
and then maybe we could chat for a few minutes.

41:41.661 --> 41:43.310
I'd love to shoot some photographs.

41:43.692 --> 41:46.326
What I'd also like to do is send you a copy of my

41:46.525 --> 41:47.046
New book.

41:47.386 --> 41:47.667
Great.

41:47.887 --> 41:51.472
It's had a lovely review on the Times Literary supplement a couple weeks ago.

41:51.852 --> 41:53.074
The woodwork was very nice.

41:53.454 --> 41:56.338
And I'd love for you to sit so you can see what I'm doing.

41:56.358 --> 41:59.222
Who is your editor at HarperCollins?

41:59.323 --> 42:00.164
Hugh Van Dusen?

42:00.484 --> 42:01.686
Yes, I know him by name.

42:01.706 --> 42:02.907
He's been around for ages.

42:02.927 --> 42:04.429
He's Harper Lee's editor.

42:04.970 --> 42:05.551
Oh, great.

42:05.671 --> 42:07.013
I guess I'm still waiting for the next book.

42:07.133 --> 42:09.597
And Jacques Barzen's editor.

42:10.638 --> 42:12.380
I feel like I'm in pretty good company.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.262
Worthy company.

42:13.542 --> 42:14.083
That's fine.

42:14.964 --> 42:15.064
Cool.

42:15.044 --> 42:16.530
Call me whenever you like.

42:16.691 --> 42:17.374
Thank you, sir.

42:17.394 --> 42:17.856
Okay.

42:17.956 --> 42:20.205
Have a nice weekend and a great holiday.

42:20.266 --> 42:21.852
Thanks a lot.

42:21.872 --> 42:22.033
Bye-bye.
