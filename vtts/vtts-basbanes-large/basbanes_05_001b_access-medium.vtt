WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:28.722
Oh yeah. Okay. So we had a bottle of uh I mean I have that you have the body okay the bottle made a great of water made a great impact on the governor too and he said that he would keep that bottle of Nashua River water on his desk. He said it's a paperweight and it's a constant reminder to him of what needed to be done.

00:29.191 --> 00:34.561
And our legislators were all there, except this one legislator whose youngster was sick.

00:34.782 --> 00:41.635
I think there were 24 legislators representing watershed constituency.

00:42.436 --> 00:44.981
And it was a very critical time.

00:45.021 --> 00:50.592
I think that what we had there is he said he was

00:53.170 --> 00:56.257
Yeah, right.

00:56.558 --> 01:11.010
I just wanted to say that this was just on the eve of the passage of the Clean Waters Act of 1966 in Massachusetts, so it was critical that we present this petition effort in Dirty

01:11.783 --> 01:30.883
Nashua River Water in the presence of our state legislators so that they could work with Governor Volpe to secure the passage of this legislation, which then subsequently made available a $150 million bond issue to assist communities to construct wastewater treatment facilities.

01:30.903 --> 01:36.269
And it also established the Division of Water Pollution Control in Massachusetts.

01:36.289 --> 01:38.771
And do you think that this was the actual catalyst?

01:38.791 --> 01:40.373
Absolutely, without...

01:40.690 --> 01:54.529
question because it was just a week, I think, before the legislature trove rolled and we've been told there wasn't a chance in the world that this legislation would be passed that legislative year, but it was passed.

01:54.969 --> 02:02.800
So what I'm saying is one of the importance of our being there or this whole effort was that in the very beginning

02:03.640 --> 02:20.419
We had made contact with the governor and with our state legislators and with all of our top elected officials and they were all supportive and they all came together to register their interests and concern and support.

02:20.439 --> 02:31.352
And then what happened was right after this, we knew that Senator Ted Kennedy was coming

02:32.277 --> 02:42.108
to Massachusetts in bringing Secretary of the Interior, Udall, to visit polluted rivers.

02:43.089 --> 02:45.311
And they were going to visit four.

02:45.331 --> 02:53.900
They hadn't planned to visit the Nashua, but we asked them to include the Nashua on his itinerary.

02:53.940 --> 02:57.424
And because of the citizen concern,

02:57.910 --> 03:02.777
demonstrated by the petition effort, they included the Nashua.

03:03.398 --> 03:10.667
And we had been told by the senator's office just three days in advance of his coming that he would be there.

03:10.768 --> 03:17.677
And in three days, we got 500 people to the airport, Fishburne-Leminister Airport, to greet them.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.302
Well, this was the largest group of people that they had.

03:21.704 --> 03:23.146
meeting them anywhere.

03:23.587 --> 03:27.252
And we had people like a busload of golden agers.

03:27.532 --> 03:29.475
Now, did you organize these people?

03:29.575 --> 03:29.976
Yes.

03:29.996 --> 03:30.777
How do you do this?

03:33.200 --> 03:42.413
I don't think we've really gotten into this, because we are hitting the significant parts, but I asked you earlier what your greatest strength was, and you said organization, how do you

03:42.764 --> 03:45.669
How do you get a busload or two or three busloads of people?

03:45.689 --> 03:56.607
Well, we'd only identified these people because the Golden Acres because they were people that helped us get the signatures on a petition to present to the governor.

03:57.108 --> 04:05.582
So when we went back to look for people and we wanted to get as many people as we could

04:06.035 --> 04:18.553
to greet Senator Kennedy and Secretary Udall, we then went back to those people who had helped us with our petition effort and asked them to get a group of people to come.

04:18.853 --> 04:22.037
So they hired a bus, and they all came, and they had signs.

04:22.098 --> 04:23.820
It was really terrific.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.565
And boy, did that make an impression on Kennedy and Udall.

04:27.585 --> 04:28.627
Well, because they were impressed by people.

04:29.207 --> 04:30.029
They were impressed by votes.

04:30.569 --> 04:31.411
Yeah, exactly.

04:31.891 --> 04:34.575
Nothing happens in a vacuum.

04:34.595 --> 04:35.316
That's right.

04:35.549 --> 04:52.433
And they said this, and this is in these newspaper clips that you have, because they were just going back to Washington to vote on this $6 billion federal legislation for monies to assist municipalities to construct wastewater treatment facilities.

04:52.473 --> 04:57.040
And they said, boy, is this going to help us get this through Congress?

04:57.901 --> 05:01.806
And you can be sure that Massachusetts will be high on the list.

05:01.906 --> 05:05.151
And then what happened was, what was really exciting was that

05:06.717 --> 05:20.889
When Senator Kennedy and Secretary Udall came to the airport, they brought Governor Volpe and Lieutenant Governor Elliot Richardson to come there too.

05:21.510 --> 05:32.800
And right after they left the airport and finished their tour, then they went back to Boston that night.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.623
Governor Volpe signed into law

05:37.295 --> 05:48.434
this Clean Waters Act of 1966, which was at that time considered to be the most comprehensive water quality act that any state had.

05:48.474 --> 05:52.500
So we really felt awfully good about that.

05:53.502 --> 06:00.754
And I remember a funny little incident that day when this group was there, a couple of funny incidents.

06:01.139 --> 06:05.484
And we gave Senator Kennedy and Secretary Udall a bottle of this water, too.

06:05.504 --> 06:15.697
And Governor Volpe looked at Secretary Udall's bottle and said, gee, you fellows didn't get nearly as good a sample as I did.

06:15.737 --> 06:19.902
And he said, here, let me open this up so you can smell it.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.005
He said, just so you can see how bad it is.

06:22.085 --> 06:22.906
Volpe said that?

06:22.926 --> 06:23.106
Yeah.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.069
And so he was opening his bottle.

06:25.149 --> 06:27.872
And when he was opening it,

06:29.573 --> 06:37.604
got unscrewed wrong and it fell all over his shoes.

06:38.425 --> 06:40.407
But anyway, everyone got a good quip of it.

06:40.988 --> 06:58.872
But the other funny thing was that I was sitting next to Lieutenant Governor Richardson and I was working on my comment because I had been asked if I was going to say something and I was trying to decide

07:00.202 --> 07:29.280
whether I should be asking for that the river be made clean enough to swim in because it was so dirty you can't imagine what a request that was to say that we want this river to be clean enough to swim in and I was fiddling with this whether it should be swimming or just boating and fishing and Lieutenant Governor Richardson said he said ask for swimming he said always ask for

07:31.403 --> 07:42.256
what are the most that you want and so that was extremely helpful to me and so for him to tell me that and so I did, I asked for swimming.

07:42.416 --> 07:43.798
He was giving you a little political tip there.

07:43.858 --> 07:52.728
He sure was and it was very useful and after that I could get up and I could ask that the Nashua River be made clean enough for swimming.

07:52.748 --> 07:56.012
Do you really hope that you think that it can be?

07:56.032 --> 07:56.493
Oh yes.

07:56.513 --> 07:59.436
Well apparently then you didn't think it could be though.

07:59.838 --> 08:09.053
I wasn't sure whether it was the most politically astute thing to be asking for at that time.

08:10.115 --> 08:13.039
And he helped me to realize that it was.

08:13.240 --> 08:23.476
And what was very important was that we spent that whole next year then preparing for a river classification hearing.

08:24.198 --> 08:26.942
And we knew, you see, the Federal Waterfall Act.

08:27.361 --> 08:39.859
1965, asked that all rivers be classified for their future highest use of interstate rivers by, I think it was March 30th, I don't know what the date was, sometime in 66.

08:39.879 --> 08:44.025
In other words, they were picking a value that they thought this is the best it can ever get to be?

08:44.085 --> 08:45.948
No, no.

08:45.968 --> 08:47.310
The best that you can hope it can be?

08:47.527 --> 08:55.939
No, they're really saying to the people, okay, we're going to give the public an opportunity to say how clean they want the rivers to be and why.

08:56.660 --> 09:08.477
And as Secretary Udall said, he said, people can have as clean of water as they want as long as they're willing to pay for it.

09:08.497 --> 09:10.260
And so we had to then

09:11.219 --> 09:21.577
find out from the people who lived in the watershed how clean they wanted their river to be and what were they willing to pay for and what did they want to use the river for.

09:21.597 --> 09:23.019
It was a pretty important thing to find out.

09:23.179 --> 09:35.320
Absolutely essential and we had a whole year to prepare for this and we worked that whole year organizing this effort and we identified

09:36.008 --> 09:43.518
every group in every community in the watershed, 32 communities.

09:43.538 --> 09:52.491
I mean, there are social groups, service groups, religious groups, fraternal groups, educational groups, and their leaders.

09:53.252 --> 09:59.541
And we contacted them, and we told them about the hearing and the importance of the hearing.

10:00.222 --> 10:05.509
And we worked to persuade them that what they thought

10:05.489 --> 10:27.480
would have an effect and we told them that we wanted a class B river and why and we told them that we hoped that they would want a class B river and that here was their chance and so

10:27.663 --> 10:30.126
Class A was unobtainable.

10:30.407 --> 10:37.837
No, no, we didn't want a Class A river because in Massachusetts a Class A river can only be used for drinking.

10:37.857 --> 10:43.164
You can't swim in it, you can't fish in it, you can't boat in it.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.926
Are there any Class A rivers there?

10:44.946 --> 10:45.207
Yes.

10:46.749 --> 10:55.080
All of the south branch of the watershed is Class A and it all drains into Wachusett-Rensifort.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.383
So really what you were shooting for was the best?

10:57.599 --> 11:02.665
Even though the number... That would provide the most benefits to the public.

11:03.006 --> 11:03.807
Right.

11:03.867 --> 11:07.772
But by wanting the best, you had to give more, right?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.394
People had to... And the cost, that's right.

11:09.754 --> 11:20.247
And so they had to really think about how much they wanted clean water in the Nashua, how important that was to them.

11:20.267 --> 11:25.193
And so when we went to the hearings,

11:26.320 --> 11:30.444
It was the largest hearing that was held in Massachusetts.

11:30.464 --> 11:31.665
Where was it held?

11:31.705 --> 11:38.371
It was held at the Fitchburg State College Auditorium, and there were hundreds of people there.

11:38.391 --> 11:49.581
And I remember people from the Department of the Interior were monitoring that meeting, and they couldn't believe that there were so many people there.

11:50.441 --> 11:55.686
And it was really funny.

11:55.902 --> 12:03.451
But they were there, really serious people, our legislators and our selectmen.

12:03.972 --> 12:19.952
You see, we had contacted also the boards of selectmen, the planning boards, the conservation commissions, the boards of health, the parks and recreation commissions, and the water departments, and the school departments, as well as these

12:20.287 --> 12:26.014
these groups to ask them to be there and to make a statement.

12:26.855 --> 12:40.012
And if they couldn't be there, to send in a written statement and to say not only how clean they wanted it, but why they wanted it to be that thing, which was very important to justify.

12:40.472 --> 12:41.534
And this was when now?

12:41.554 --> 12:42.535
What year was this?

12:42.555 --> 12:44.317
This was in 1967.

12:44.377 --> 12:46.280
The hearing was in March of 1967.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.062
Would you say this was the critical point?

12:48.342 --> 12:48.943
Yes.

12:50.695 --> 12:57.107
And the reason is because without the backing, you couldn't have done it.

12:57.267 --> 12:59.311
Well, it was official, you see.

12:59.391 --> 13:11.573
The Federal Water Quality Act of 1965 said every state must classify their interstate waters for their future highest use

13:11.553 --> 13:13.940
by, I think it's June 30, 1977.

13:13.980 --> 13:23.267
And you'll see information, these newspaper clips about it.

13:23.905 --> 13:32.676
What was so important about it was that it gave the public an opportunity to participate in the classification of our rivers.

13:32.696 --> 13:43.770
See, I had been very angry before then because when I was inquiring about the Nashua River, shortly after I moved here, I contacted

13:43.750 --> 13:46.573
There was no Division of Water Pollution Control then.

13:47.674 --> 13:54.181
And it was, well, the Department of Public Health had responsibility for the water.

13:54.201 --> 14:00.108
But there was a group, and there still is a group, called the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission.

14:00.128 --> 14:08.837
And it was a group that had representation from the various New England states, and also New York.

14:08.857 --> 14:12.441
And they would get together, and

14:13.163 --> 14:25.890
a certain number of times during the year to discuss water quality problems and to decide on a kind of informal basis

14:28.233 --> 14:34.159
what rivers they were going to try to upgrade, and how much they're going to try to upgrade it.

14:34.239 --> 14:35.601
So it was, in fact, incredible.

14:35.841 --> 14:49.775
Yeah, so I found out just before this hearing, like maybe a year or so before this hearing, that this group had just gotten together and they discussed the Nashua, and they decided they were going to upgrade it to a D. And I said, a D?

14:49.835 --> 14:51.457
I said, that's terrible.

14:51.677 --> 14:52.958
That's nothing.

14:52.978 --> 14:54.460
And the director said, well,

14:55.688 --> 14:57.910
You know, that's what we decided to do.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.672
And I said, well, I said, I live in this area.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.353
I'm concerned.

15:01.373 --> 15:02.294
I said, I don't like that.

15:02.314 --> 15:04.716
I said, I want it to be better than that.

15:04.736 --> 15:05.737
I said, what can I do?

15:06.117 --> 15:07.358
He said, nothing.

15:08.019 --> 15:11.342
And I said, you know, you've got to be kidding.

15:11.362 --> 15:13.284
I said, there must be something to do.

15:13.304 --> 15:19.789
And he said, well, if you can get the governor to change the designation.

15:21.411 --> 15:25.054
But then what was so important was that this federal law firm was passing

15:25.912 --> 15:55.260
before a river is classified for its future highest use there must be a public hearing people must be heard so this was wonderful and so we knew that the state was coming into that hearing asking for a D river and so then we were told and I think I feel it was correct information that because of our

15:55.898 --> 16:11.532
citizen interest and concern that the state decided that they couldn't come in with a request for a D. They would have to come in with a request for a C because, of course, they were being monitored by the Department of Interior.

16:11.592 --> 16:15.556
That's why the Department of Interior was there, was to see what was happening.

16:16.357 --> 16:21.441
So they came asking for a C. We said, that's not good enough.

16:21.462 --> 16:22.543
We said, this is the hearing.

16:22.563 --> 16:24.184
We want B.

16:24.502 --> 16:37.077
And as a result of the hearing, after the hearing, the state decided that, well, they would have to respond to what we wanted.

16:37.428 --> 16:47.757
We just don't think that it is technically or economically possible to attain a leap in five years.

16:47.997 --> 16:50.980
But we will... Well, is that the time frame?

16:51.120 --> 16:53.022
Yeah, right, right, five years.

16:53.282 --> 16:56.005
But we think that we've got to be realistic.

16:56.025 --> 17:03.211
We think the very best that can be done is a modified C on the main stem.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.574
And the modification was that...

17:07.043 --> 17:10.729
was the bacterial requirement.

17:11.029 --> 17:22.187
And so the bacterial requirement was that it be a B bacterial requirement so that the river would in fact be safe for swimming.

17:22.988 --> 17:34.587
And so once the classification was set after the hearing, it had to be approved by the Department of Interior, and it was, then we just worked very, very hard to see that

17:35.022 --> 17:39.167
I mean, the schedules then were established for these polluters to meet.

17:39.467 --> 17:43.952
And we worked very hard to see that these schedules were being met.

17:44.453 --> 17:51.821
And the division only had a certain number of people working, and they didn't have enough people to do all the things that needed to be done.

17:52.181 --> 18:02.633
But because we were an active citizens group on the Nashua, we did, our river did get more attention than some other rivers.

18:02.933 --> 18:06.277
Would something like this have been impossible five or six years ago?

18:07.619 --> 18:08.821
Yeah.

18:08.841 --> 18:10.243
Yeah.

18:10.263 --> 18:10.583
Absolutely.

18:10.703 --> 18:19.896
Again, this is one of the concrete, tangible results, I would say, is that you can put out a guide to canoeing.

18:19.916 --> 18:24.061
Where would you say some of the best places for me to go look at the river would be?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.244
What would you recommend?

18:26.264 --> 18:29.328
Probably from, well, bridges.

18:30.430 --> 18:32.012
Let's see.

18:42.505 --> 18:48.691
where rivers come together, like in Lancaster.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.993
I'm thinking for pictures type thing.

18:51.013 --> 18:51.513
Pardon?

18:51.533 --> 18:52.634
I'm thinking for pictures.

18:52.694 --> 18:54.156
Yeah, I am too.

18:59.380 --> 19:03.905
Well, I understand that photographers like to get up high and look down.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.286
Is that what you're looking for?

19:05.806 --> 19:07.648
Yeah, but I think kids fishing would be great too.

19:07.668 --> 19:08.309
Kids fishing.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.972
Well, you really have to

19:12.847 --> 19:16.773
Why don't you think about it, because I'm going to have to call you back for some more questions anyway.

19:16.953 --> 19:17.995
Yeah.

19:18.015 --> 19:22.321
I wonder if there were any frustrations that you had, any major frustrations along the way.

19:22.421 --> 19:23.743
Let me tell you about pictures first.

19:23.764 --> 19:28.310
We've got a tremendous collection of colored slides over at our office.

19:28.491 --> 19:29.592
That was my next question.

19:29.632 --> 19:30.694
Showing it bad, too?

19:30.774 --> 19:31.075
Yeah.

19:31.776 --> 19:34.480
Are all the colors, those famous red and yellow colors?

19:34.600 --> 19:35.481
Yeah, we've got those.

19:35.501 --> 19:36.583
I mean, is that gone now?

19:36.603 --> 19:38.526
That's no longer, right?

19:38.546 --> 19:39.327
Yeah, no.

19:40.117 --> 19:50.188
But, you know, we're doing something to cities we haven't talked about, and we're talking about mostly, I think, we haven't talked about our urban greenway very much.

19:50.368 --> 19:52.050
We should talk about that.

19:52.070 --> 19:58.277
But we've worked very hard this past year in Fitchburg with the Fitchburg River Subcommittee, which we helped organize.

19:59.538 --> 20:03.002
And we're very much concerned that

20:03.623 --> 20:11.852
people in Fitchburg who were thinking of those wastewater treatment facilities as big white elephants and being very resentful of them.

20:12.552 --> 20:32.854
So we did go in and meet with Fitchburg business leaders and particularly, well, the time that I became most involved in meeting with Fitchburg business leaders was

20:33.644 --> 20:46.017
about a year ago when the City Revitalization Committee were looking for suggestions for revitalization of the city of Fitchburg.

20:46.037 --> 20:59.331
And so we suggested to them that the revitalization of the city take place along the river, that here, you know, the river had been a terrible deficit to the city, but now it represented its

20:59.581 --> 21:01.223
a greatest potential asset.

21:01.744 --> 21:03.105
Like they did in San Antonio.

21:03.486 --> 21:03.646
Yeah.

21:04.567 --> 21:14.940
And that, yes, that would be a terrible waste of Fitchburg taxpayers' money if they didn't take advantage of the clean water that they were producing in their treatment facilities.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.384
Those two treatment plants cost about $25 million.

21:18.725 --> 21:19.105
Wow.

21:19.125 --> 21:23.571
And it cost them, jeez, I don't know, it must be close to a million dollars to operate annually.

21:23.591 --> 21:24.552
It's a big expense.

21:24.572 --> 21:28.797
I mean, next to schools, their largest capital expenditure.

21:29.118 --> 21:29.318
Wow.

21:29.618 --> 21:55.221
We're saying, okay, the economy of the region can be enhanced by the natural river if you business leaders and city planners recognize this possibility and take advantage of it, plan for it, take advantage of it.

21:55.724 --> 22:08.299
And so we helped to organize this river subcommittee to do this and to tie in the revitalization of the city with the restoration of the river, establish an urban greenway.

22:08.752 --> 22:26.678
And in this instance, working with the Corps of Engineers that plans to do some rehabilitation work there in the city, to make sure that whatever work they do would complement or assist with the subcommittee's work.

22:26.698 --> 22:28.701
And we hired them.

22:29.018 --> 22:36.547
an intern who's a landscape designer who's getting his masters at Harvard to work with the subcommittee.

22:36.567 --> 22:40.031
And he has developed wonderful plans.

22:40.231 --> 22:45.357
He's been working with the city planners, the revitalization committee, to develop these plans.

22:45.377 --> 22:46.498
What would they include?

22:46.538 --> 22:48.220
What types of things?

22:48.240 --> 22:55.228
A pathway in pocket parks.

22:56.423 --> 23:16.806
The committee has begun to talk with the industries and other landowners along the river about the plans and about opportunities for their participation and how they would benefit, how the city would benefit.

23:16.826 --> 23:19.288
Do you think this is on the immediate horizon?

23:19.328 --> 23:19.849
Yes.

23:20.993 --> 23:21.974
Like how close?

23:21.994 --> 23:24.477
Like at Lowell, you know, it's a Lowell cultural heritage part.

23:24.497 --> 23:30.224
I was just going to tell you this, like that just today, earlier today, and I was brought up in Lowell.

23:30.244 --> 23:30.404
Yeah.

23:30.424 --> 23:31.826
And I know the river around.

23:31.846 --> 23:31.966
Right.

23:31.986 --> 23:36.811
And I was driving with my wife and my sister, I said, gee, look at, I mean, it's nice.

23:37.192 --> 23:38.934
You know, it's very, very nice.

23:38.994 --> 23:42.318
Right along by the GE, by the General Electric Plant.

23:42.959 --> 23:45.421
Are you talking about Fitchburg or Lowell?

23:45.522 --> 23:46.062
In Lowell.

23:46.202 --> 23:46.763
In Lowell.

23:46.783 --> 23:47.444
Yeah.

23:47.464 --> 23:48.305
Did you mention Lowell?

23:48.485 --> 23:49.106
Yeah, I did.

23:49.126 --> 23:49.787
I did.

23:49.967 --> 23:50.207
Just.

23:50.812 --> 23:55.157
Right there, it's, you know, they've got these walks and things from afar.

23:55.177 --> 23:55.898
It's really nice.

23:56.018 --> 24:04.449
I don't know that particular site, but I do know that there are some beautiful places along the Merrimack River in Lowell.

24:04.469 --> 24:11.617
And I do know some of the plants, the Lowell Heritage Cultural Park.

24:12.278 --> 24:14.681
And they're, that's terrific.

24:15.402 --> 24:19.767
And so, so anyway, I just didn't want to.

24:19.787 --> 24:20.548
Well, do you think

24:20.900 --> 24:24.305
Are they moving towards the establishment of these things?

24:24.465 --> 24:27.470
Do you think it's just at the talking stage now?

24:28.632 --> 24:30.114
Well, they've got the plans.

24:30.675 --> 24:31.897
They know all the owners.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.462
Who can I talk to to find out something about these plans?

24:36.945 --> 24:38.487
Well, you can talk with Ruth.

24:39.023 --> 25:00.113
Mayor, who's the chairman of the Fitchburg Conservation Commission, or you can talk with Mayor, M-A-Y-O-R, Mrs. Harry Mayor, or you can talk with the city planner, what's his name?

25:00.133 --> 25:01.054
I can find out.

25:01.074 --> 25:04.659
Bob, hmm, jumped out of my mind.

25:04.699 --> 25:05.340
I can find out.

25:05.661 --> 25:06.121
Okay.

25:06.261 --> 25:08.845
And

25:09.584 --> 25:16.011
So you do have a lot of photos down at... Mostly colored slides.

25:16.292 --> 25:16.572
Great.

25:17.393 --> 25:18.314
Maybe they want that.

25:18.935 --> 25:19.395
Hopefully.

25:19.676 --> 25:20.797
Yeah.

25:20.817 --> 25:23.360
I'd be delighted if they used the color pictures.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.783
Yeah.

25:25.843 --> 25:30.969
Let's see where we are.

25:32.691 --> 25:33.972
I think, I know

25:34.222 --> 25:35.444
We should wrap it up pretty soon.

25:35.464 --> 25:37.787
Two hours is probably long enough for one session.

25:38.909 --> 25:43.135
And I'll have to evaluate what we've got.

25:44.457 --> 25:46.740
Were there any frustrations along the way that?

25:49.023 --> 25:50.225
No, not really.

25:50.365 --> 25:59.638
Not for me, because I really get it's like if something goes

26:00.682 --> 26:04.808
Well, it's like a shot of adrenaline for me.

26:04.908 --> 26:07.893
It's a new challenge.

26:08.694 --> 26:22.335
And there have been... But I know what you're talking about, and I can tell you that at one point, it was Fitchburg Paper Company,

26:22.552 --> 26:35.469
decided that they wanted to withdraw from their contractual agreement with the city to participate in the construction of a wastewater treatment facility just, I think it was five days before groundbreaking.

26:35.489 --> 26:35.649
Wow.

26:36.130 --> 26:37.892
And that was... Why did they do that?

26:37.952 --> 26:39.073
Why did they?

26:39.194 --> 26:40.495
You'd have to ask them.

26:40.515 --> 26:40.636
Okay.

26:40.976 --> 26:43.960
But anyway... But at any rate, that's what they wanted to do.

26:44.460 --> 26:49.487
This was when, roughly... Oh, geez, that must have been in 60...

26:53.129 --> 26:54.210
Maybe 70?

26:54.451 --> 26:55.052
I'm not sure.

26:55.232 --> 26:55.973
Would that be?

26:56.013 --> 26:58.636
No, it wasn't that long ago because it's only been built.

26:58.957 --> 27:00.379
I don't know, maybe 72?

27:00.399 --> 27:00.639
Okay.

27:00.719 --> 27:02.541
Something like that.

27:02.882 --> 27:03.963
Yeah, 73, 72.

27:04.284 --> 27:08.029
And so it was just when EPA was being organized, probably 72.

27:09.470 --> 27:17.120
And they didn't feel that they had any real thrust.

27:17.501 --> 27:20.445
The state didn't feel that they had a handle on the thing.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.107
And...

27:22.643 --> 27:25.607
The warehouses didn't want to get involved.

27:25.627 --> 27:26.889
I mean, they were very upset.

27:27.130 --> 27:29.673
The city didn't really want to get involved.

27:29.693 --> 27:38.887
And so we organized a citizen's suit against Fitchburg Paper Company, really against Lytton Industries.

27:40.048 --> 27:45.516
And we received legal assistance, well, from one of our own directors.

27:45.817 --> 27:52.026
But we received legal assistance from EPA and from

27:52.327 --> 27:57.274
the state to help us because they felt that we were in the best position.

27:57.495 --> 27:59.758
And this is five days before ground breaking?

27:59.778 --> 28:01.240
Yes, I think it was five days.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.483
It was five or ten days before ground breaking.

28:03.584 --> 28:15.120
And it would have been a disaster if they'd been successful because it was felt that it would then hold back construction by at least five years.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.284
What was their share of that?

28:18.325 --> 28:20.308
Well, they were

28:20.828 --> 28:22.050
It was substantial.

28:22.090 --> 28:23.852
Weyerhaeuser was in this also, right?

28:23.952 --> 28:24.553
That's right.

28:24.653 --> 28:27.296
So if Fitchburg pulled out, they'd have pulled out, maybe.

28:28.678 --> 28:29.359
Maybe not.

28:29.379 --> 28:34.305
Well, no, they really... I don't think they could have.

28:34.325 --> 28:34.685
Okay.

28:34.705 --> 28:34.925
Yeah.

28:35.026 --> 28:36.748
Well, did the suit actually go to court?

28:36.788 --> 28:39.231
Did you actually file suit?

28:39.431 --> 28:41.774
No, we were preparing the suit.

28:42.455 --> 28:45.579
But it was apparent to them that legal action was worth coming.

28:45.999 --> 28:46.760
Oh, yes.

28:47.761 --> 28:49.924
And so...

28:50.275 --> 28:55.603
That was certainly a major consideration for their deciding not to go ahead.

28:55.623 --> 28:59.428
Did you advise them that a suit was going on?

28:59.448 --> 29:00.449
Oh, yes.

29:00.490 --> 29:01.050
Oh, yes.

29:01.411 --> 29:02.112
Indeed, we did.

29:02.192 --> 29:03.914
What would the suit have sought?

29:03.934 --> 29:06.098
I mean, damages, monetary damages?

29:08.281 --> 29:09.022
Let's see.

29:09.302 --> 29:10.183
No, it wasn't.

29:10.203 --> 29:15.591
I mean, it was done.

29:16.263 --> 29:17.204
I don't remember.

29:17.285 --> 29:18.687
We've got a copy of that.

29:18.727 --> 29:22.813
We have that information in our file at work.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.298
Maybe we can check on that, too.

29:27.500 --> 29:27.600
Yeah.

29:27.801 --> 29:28.902
That's another example.

29:29.103 --> 29:29.764
But you're right.

29:29.824 --> 29:31.126
It was damages.

29:31.586 --> 29:45.207
And we'd have to come up with the figure, and this is some of the help that we were offered by EPA to show what environmental damages

29:46.840 --> 29:59.061
occurred over the next several years if Fitchburg Paper Company failed to participate and the construction was delayed by another five years.

29:59.121 --> 30:00.824
Maybe I could talk to somebody down there.

30:01.025 --> 30:04.190
Who should I talk to at the Watershed Association?

30:04.210 --> 30:08.798
Well, you can talk to Lois Murray, Managing Director, or Brown

30:16.203 --> 30:19.328
They're both on vacation this week, and they'll be back in the church.

30:20.009 --> 30:21.611
I'll be working on this next week.

30:21.631 --> 30:21.791
Yeah.

30:22.933 --> 30:34.310
And then there were other things, too, like when Bill Flynn resigned as mayor to become special congressional assistant for Congressman Drinan.

30:34.330 --> 30:46.007
He thought everything was just going to be smooth sailing, but I think it was within a week of the time that the new mayor, or was Mayor Blackwell, I guess, when he was elected,

30:46.493 --> 30:59.830
took office, he asked for an investigation and he thought that he was concerned that there might have been some wrongdoing.

31:00.170 --> 31:12.366
And then it was a situation where not only did we have a new mayor who hadn't participated in any of the discussion or any of the earlier votes on

31:13.072 --> 31:21.310
in Fitchburg on the structural wastewater treatment facilities, but the city council, a majority of them were new members.

31:21.330 --> 31:24.637
And they had to be educated and won over.

31:25.239 --> 31:33.156
So we, and he, Mayor Blackwell called a halt to the construction.
