00:02.140 --> 00:08.912
You know, I don't tell this to everybody, but I've read all your books, I think.

00:09.654 --> 00:13.822
I can't say I've read any of your poetry, but I have read all those.

00:17.027 --> 00:24.100
And I guess, you know, I was just talking this over with my wife, and she said, what's your first question?

00:24.181 --> 00:24.942
I said,

00:25.310 --> 00:31.971
How is it that a man with a Ph.D., a poet, comes to write thrillers?

00:31.992 --> 00:34.379
And she said, money, probably.

00:34.399 --> 00:37.108
I think that more...

00:37.645 --> 00:41.811
The weirder thing would be if I started out writing these and went to poetry.

00:42.452 --> 00:43.273
Yeah, yes.

00:43.293 --> 00:49.202
You would really have to ask me, why the hell did you want to go from writing thrillers to writing poetry?

00:49.442 --> 00:52.186
You know, I think, well, obviously that is one of the reasons.

00:52.226 --> 00:56.312
Well, she was teasing and so am I. No, I'm very frank about it.

00:56.352 --> 00:58.736
That is one of the reasons.

00:58.996 --> 01:02.542
I didn't suspect there was this much money.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.885
But, you know, I actually...

01:05.506 --> 01:20.268
I have always loved these kind of books, and I had a sort of midlife intellectual crisis in the university that came seven or eight years ago, I guess, something like that.

01:20.288 --> 01:27.718
I was teaching a class in bestsellers, which I just... Where was this?

01:27.939 --> 01:34.348
This was at Florida International University of Miami, one of the state universities in Miami.

01:35.442 --> 01:38.185
We've got 30,000 students, but nobody's heard of it.

01:41.328 --> 01:47.555
But we have a master of fine arts program in creative writing, and we've got very good students.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.778
It's not a well-known place.

01:50.798 --> 01:53.101
Anyway, I was teaching this class.

01:53.801 --> 02:04.993
My concept for this class was what is, I suppose, more or less conventional with, or was conventional with me at the time.

02:05.362 --> 02:15.633
which was I was gonna choose all these books that I'd never read before, like Gone with the Wind and From Here to Eternity, big bestsellers of the past and a few current bestsellers.

02:16.554 --> 02:34.153
And the idea was to get them in this class and then make fun of them, to ridicule them, to show how inferior they were to the literary canon which my students were literature majors were studying all the time, Faulkner and Joyce, what have you.

02:34.657 --> 03:02.520
what i found was i like these books it shocked me it was the first time i'd ever read you hadn't read them prior to this oh no i'd never read gone gone with the wind can i tell you something i could never finish gone with the wind well i liked it you know i like the movie better yeah well i probably wouldn't have liked it at certain times in my life but i i maybe i was ready for this i don't know maybe i all the the other things were tilting in this direction too but

03:02.500 --> 03:04.922
It doesn't surprise me that she only wrote one book.

03:05.223 --> 03:07.605
Yeah, that's true.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.128
It wasn't like it was this big brainy book.

03:11.129 --> 03:12.070
Yeah.

03:12.090 --> 03:23.981
But the thing about all of these books was that they had and still do have a kind of, despite their awkwardness of style and a lot of the things that I was going to make fun of them, they truly are.

03:24.682 --> 03:25.603
But they engaged you.

03:25.923 --> 03:28.626
They engaged me in a kind of primitive, mythic,

03:29.213 --> 03:56.520
fundamental way that surprised the hell out of me yeah well let me say may i interject um i find you know i'm 50 okay but and i've been a book book critic uh for call miss blah blah for you know close to 20 years and you really you know you you you you are obligated of course to to read and enjoy the serious books however on the other hand i have to say

03:56.500 --> 04:02.209
I'm, you know, my books of preference now these days are books that really entertain me.

04:02.229 --> 04:02.910
Yeah.

04:03.531 --> 04:05.995
In a kind of quasi-cerebral way.

04:06.596 --> 04:10.282
You know, I mean, I don't like the real, you know what I'm saying.

04:10.342 --> 04:10.843
Yeah.

04:10.863 --> 04:13.748
Well, that's what, I mean, that's my midlife crisis, too.

04:13.908 --> 04:23.824
And I mean, I've just come to that point, too, that life's too short to be reading John Hawks and

04:24.344 --> 04:26.947
and John Barth forever again.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.190
I got the new John Barth sitting over here.

04:29.210 --> 04:30.132
I haven't opened it yet.

04:31.073 --> 04:36.860
Well, you know, I mean, I read them in my youth, and I'm glad I did, and I'm glad I laid that foundation.

04:38.182 --> 04:39.584
Did you read Proust in your youth?

04:39.624 --> 04:39.844
Yes.

04:40.185 --> 04:41.887
Did you think you'd pick him up again?

04:42.648 --> 04:43.068
No, no.

04:43.089 --> 04:45.872
I read, you know, Brothers Karamazov and all those things.

04:45.892 --> 04:47.314
I'm glad I had the energy and

04:47.581 --> 04:50.765
I read Moby Dick all the way through, all that stuff.

04:50.785 --> 04:50.885
Yeah.

04:50.905 --> 04:54.188
But, you know, right now I'd rather read Dutch Leonard.

04:54.329 --> 04:54.929
Dutch Leonard.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.072
James Lee Burke and the people.

04:57.092 --> 04:58.613
Jim Burke is great, isn't he?

04:58.693 --> 04:59.514
Oh, he's terrific.

04:59.675 --> 04:59.815
Yeah.

04:59.835 --> 05:00.736
He's a great guy.

05:00.836 --> 05:11.348
And I find those books so much more important and that they are, you know, saving the novel as far as I'm concerned.

05:11.368 --> 05:16.193
I really, I truly believe this and I can give a... Well, give me a quote on that and then get back to where you were.

05:16.353 --> 05:17.014
But...

05:17.517 --> 05:18.018
I'm sorry?

05:18.598 --> 05:20.601
Give me a quote on that, how they use that.

05:20.621 --> 05:30.274
Well, I think they are saving some of the major ingredients, Burke and Dutch Leonard and a whole host of... Russ Thomas, do you read?

05:30.754 --> 05:31.776
Yeah.

05:32.276 --> 05:38.344
And there's a guy here in Boston who just published his first novel called...

05:38.915 --> 05:40.617
I'm looking at it.

05:40.877 --> 05:41.458
Kenneth Abel.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.060
I haven't read it yet, but I'm looking at it.

05:43.080 --> 05:43.560
It's over here.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.161
It's very good.

05:44.441 --> 05:45.322
It's very good.

05:45.402 --> 05:57.255
And it's books like that that I think are saving certain characteristics of the novel that have virtually disappeared in the mainstream.

05:57.275 --> 06:01.180
What separates the good ones from the crowd?

06:01.240 --> 06:03.943
The good thriller?

06:04.243 --> 06:04.563
Yeah.

06:05.424 --> 06:06.846
Well, that they have...

06:07.214 --> 06:16.097
that they have more than just what's on the surface, that they, if you would choose to do a second reading, they would reward a second reading.

06:16.578 --> 06:20.548
They stir you emotionally, they stir you intellectually.

06:21.052 --> 06:26.820
They don't sacrifice any of that to the page turning aspect.

06:26.900 --> 06:34.650
Do you bristle at the suggestion that it is a genre book, that you're writing it within a genre?

06:34.871 --> 06:36.533
Well, I don't bristle, no.

06:36.973 --> 06:41.119
That's just the name of the business, the aspect of the business.

06:41.605 --> 06:56.239
somewhere in my spirit, I sort of slump, I wouldn't say bristle, I'm disappointed in a way when I'm taken as merely this, because I think that comes

06:56.489 --> 06:58.351
mainly from a lack of real knowledge.

06:59.793 --> 07:04.898
Because the fact is that they're just simply are good books and they're good books that are not good books.

07:04.918 --> 07:06.820
I mean, do we really say that P.D.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.983
James is a genre writer, for instance?

07:09.764 --> 07:11.506
Or John le Carre, for that matter?

07:11.526 --> 07:14.909
John le Carre or, you know, there are a lot of people like that.

07:14.950 --> 07:24.420
Ross McDonald, Richard Chandler, the guys of the past, the people who really built the foundation for this kind of serious book that has primer or...

07:25.210 --> 07:27.672
Suspense is a major aspect of it.

07:27.692 --> 07:29.494
So let's go back to your class in Miami.

07:29.514 --> 07:29.614
Okay.

07:29.954 --> 07:48.952
Well, anyway, I was teaching this class, and I found out I liked these classes, our books, and so I had to shift gears in the middle of this course and find some other way to approach these books because I was finding that I was being stirred by them in surprising ways.

07:48.992 --> 07:53.817
And I admitted all this to my students and said, now what do we do?

07:54.640 --> 08:05.281
And so what we did was we kind of accumulated a list of recurrent characteristics that all these books had in common.

08:05.622 --> 08:14.640
And I tried to use Joseph Campbell at that point to inject a kind of mythic structure and talk about

08:16.004 --> 08:18.667
Were these graduate students or undergraduates?

08:18.868 --> 08:20.429
These are undergraduate students.

08:20.450 --> 08:23.233
Joseph Campbell must have really hit.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.737
I think I can make these things fairly accessible.

08:26.837 --> 08:30.602
I don't think they were daunted by any of this stuff.

08:30.622 --> 08:31.623
I'm teasing a little bit.

08:31.643 --> 08:33.045
Go ahead.

08:34.227 --> 08:38.732
Actually, it was one of the best courses I've ever taught, if I recall.

08:38.752 --> 08:44.239
I was thrilled every day to walk in there because we were sort of

08:44.607 --> 08:53.796
redefining our purpose for being in the university and saying, you know, asking why is the sky blue kind of questions.

08:54.697 --> 08:57.299
And it was thrilling.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.321
Why do we believe what we believe?

08:59.481 --> 09:01.203
Epistemological questions.

09:01.223 --> 09:13.635
They were asking why are... For instance, one of the things they did in this class was they examined the various literary prizes, the things that really codified the major

09:14.780 --> 09:16.462
the literary tradition of our time.

09:18.144 --> 09:21.548
How is a Pulitzer Prize, a Pulitzer Prize novel defined?

09:22.729 --> 09:27.815
What goes into the decision making in a National Book Award prize?

09:28.395 --> 09:31.599
Different students research different aspects of this.

09:31.619 --> 09:32.981
Why is one book a bestseller?

09:33.741 --> 09:37.326
What's behind the New York Times bestseller list and so on?

09:37.866 --> 09:38.987
And we just analyzed.

09:39.027 --> 09:42.171
Sounds like a pretty interesting course.

09:42.657 --> 09:43.560
What did you call it?

09:43.580 --> 09:44.604
What did you call the course?

09:44.624 --> 09:46.130
It was called Best Sellers.

09:47.474 --> 09:51.790
Fortunately, it was 14 weeks long because after the first three weeks,

09:52.192 --> 09:55.738
I shifted gears and said, wait a minute, now what?

09:55.778 --> 09:57.561
We're going to start doing a different tank here.

09:57.902 --> 09:59.685
Strictly contemporary, or did you go back?

09:59.705 --> 10:01.228
No, we started with Gone with the Wind.

10:01.248 --> 10:05.635
We did the big books of the, you know, a big book from the 40s, 50s, 60s.

10:05.655 --> 10:10.043
But I mean, the definition of the bestseller is an American book published in this century, I guess.

10:10.504 --> 10:11.145
Yeah, okay.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.609
Right, so it was limited in that way.

10:14.821 --> 10:15.742
But anyway, I'm sorry.

10:15.802 --> 10:19.287
I got you off track with a cute comment.

10:21.710 --> 10:30.282
But one of the things that came out of this class was we accumulated this list of recurrent facts or recurrent images and situations.

10:30.983 --> 10:34.287
And some of them aligned very neatly with Joseph Campbell.

10:34.307 --> 10:35.589
Some of them didn't.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.234
And at the end of this course, I said, geez, look what I got here.

10:39.294 --> 10:41.757
I've got, maybe it's not a prescription.

10:42.226 --> 10:44.710
to write a bestseller.

10:44.730 --> 10:45.851
But a blueprint, maybe.

10:46.032 --> 10:47.954
But it's pretty interesting.

10:47.974 --> 10:49.537
It's a pretty interesting list.

10:49.557 --> 10:51.740
Now, where were you at this point as a writer?

10:52.681 --> 11:03.437
Well, I had written three novels that got great writers of rejection, but they weren't going to be... But you were unpublished.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.120
Yeah, I was unpublished as a novelist.

11:05.140 --> 11:07.423
I had published four books of poetry and

11:07.876 --> 11:09.878
and lots of literary short stories.

11:09.918 --> 11:11.039
Can you nail down the year for me?

11:11.079 --> 11:12.841
You said about seven, was it in fact?

11:13.061 --> 11:14.122
Eighty-five.

11:14.303 --> 11:15.304
Okay, so it was nine.

11:16.505 --> 11:16.605
Yeah.

11:16.625 --> 11:16.965
Okay.

11:17.446 --> 11:28.157
And I published, you know, things in Kenyan Review and Southern Review and Georgia Review and the literary magazines that distinguish the things that get you tenure and promotion.

11:28.457 --> 11:29.498
How old were you at the time?

11:30.339 --> 11:31.280
Oh, eighty-five.

11:31.641 --> 11:34.364
I was born in forty-seven.

11:35.184 --> 11:36.786
So you were, okay.

11:38.504 --> 11:45.331
And this was like about a year and a half before I started, or about a year before I started Undercover of Daylight.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.794
Or maybe I was just beginning to think about it.

11:49.335 --> 11:51.337
So you emerged from the course with this blueprint.

11:51.597 --> 11:52.959
I did.

11:53.099 --> 12:00.987
And I also emerged from the course with a new sense of what I was permitted to do.

12:01.468 --> 12:03.870
And permitted...

12:04.289 --> 12:13.200
a different sense of who my audience might be, that the large audience was fair game.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.267
I didn't have to just please my colleagues and please my graduate faculty from long ago.

12:18.887 --> 12:28.239
I didn't have to write a mainstream book that was respectable and by the gold standard definition of the academic world.

12:28.780 --> 12:31.343
I was just throwing over my

12:32.403 --> 12:49.538
you know, the foundations of my education left and right, and saying that the books that I read with great pleasure and kind of sinful excitement on the weekends were actually the books that I enjoyed more than the books I was teaching in a week.

12:49.558 --> 13:01.768
And those books were, you know, Travis McGee, Elmore Leonard, Robert Parker, and all those books that are in this so-called genre.

13:02.963 --> 13:32.953
So the combination of these things, of feeling that I had failed, really, to write the kind of respectable book that I thought I ought to write, and finding myself falling deeper and deeper in love with these other kinds of books, and then going through this other intellectual crisis that I did during that year, I had a summer off, and I just sat down and wrote and read the kind of books that I really liked.

13:33.237 --> 13:35.500
that's the kind of book I'm going to write.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.244
Where did the character come from, this Thorne character?

13:38.264 --> 13:43.351
Well, I was living in Key Largo at the time, which was the other magical ingredient in here.

13:43.571 --> 13:53.084
I had moved out of Miami, which was a 50-mile drive to get down to the upper Key Largo.

13:54.325 --> 13:57.309
And that also took me by surprise.

13:57.590 --> 14:02.316
I wanted simply just to have a life that was a little less...

14:03.055 --> 14:09.064
of an urban life, more like the kind of life I grew up in in Kentucky, which was a small town life.

14:10.026 --> 14:14.453
And what I found was that I was surrounded by all these really interesting characters.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.596
I felt like I'd landed on Mars.

14:17.277 --> 14:29.817
And I had all of a sudden the excitement of an anthropologist, I guess, you know, coming to a foreign culture, and everybody just seemed freakishly wonderful.

14:30.719 --> 14:30.919
And

14:31.844 --> 14:34.350
My next door neighbor became Thorne.

14:35.332 --> 14:47.220
He was not living quite as Henry David Thoreau type of life is Thorne, but he was, he is, he was and is a very,

14:49.242 --> 14:52.086
separated from the culture.

14:52.106 --> 14:54.270
Did he build his house from Philippine mahogany?

14:54.390 --> 14:56.673
Well, I met the guy that did that, yeah.

14:56.753 --> 14:58.396
Yeah, I did meet that guy.

14:58.696 --> 15:01.841
He lives there, and he's a carpenter and a woodsmith.

15:02.742 --> 15:05.306
They really do send stuff over to Philippine mahogany.

15:05.527 --> 15:05.767
Absolutely.

15:06.268 --> 15:07.149
Is that unbelievable?

15:07.449 --> 15:08.451
I know, I know.

15:08.551 --> 15:12.257
I'm an old Navy guy, and I spent a lot of time in the Philippines.

15:12.297 --> 15:14.440
It's horrifying.

15:14.656 --> 15:25.513
I just came back from Borneo and Sumatra in Singapore doing research on this new book and got to see these mountains that are just stripped bare.

15:25.894 --> 15:27.136
Unbelievable.

15:27.156 --> 15:34.588
You're talking about they're never learning the lessons that all these other countries in the world, the first world countries, have learned.

15:35.193 --> 15:38.076
you shouldn't be doing this.

15:38.096 --> 15:44.683
This is a disaster, but we go in there and tell them don't do this, and we sound extremely hypocritical and patronizing.

15:45.323 --> 15:47.305
I'm sorry, but anyway, go back to Thorne.

15:47.846 --> 16:03.782
Yeah, well, Thorne was based on a conglomeration of people that I really met in Key Largo, and I felt a sense that I was changing intellectually, emotionally, my whole

16:04.032 --> 16:05.955
The rhythms of life were different there.

16:06.936 --> 16:13.606
I was more oriented to the water and to the nature than I'd been in years, years.

16:14.467 --> 16:24.262
I'd once been very much oriented that way as a young man growing up, and I'd just been totally distracted by urban life for 20 years.

16:24.302 --> 16:33.195
This was a real liberation in lots and lots of ways, and I'm still not over it.

16:33.563 --> 16:39.472
I'm still coasting on that five years that I spent in Key Largo, even though now I live back in Miami.

16:40.173 --> 16:49.968
I live on a couple of acres of very removed, very natural kind of environment.

16:49.988 --> 16:51.129
Now, who's the fly tire?

16:52.411 --> 17:01.545
Well, this guy, my next-door neighbor, was a charter fisherman, and he did bun fishing.

17:02.048 --> 17:09.598
He showed me a lot of things about tying flies and about fly fishing for bonefish and took me out many times.

17:10.960 --> 17:18.430
So I got the kind of zen hunting quality that Thorne feels.

17:19.912 --> 17:27.943
I learned that from this guy and then I pursued it myself with mixed results, low results actually.

17:28.444 --> 17:30.807
But Thorne is obviously my

17:31.327 --> 17:33.230
idealized version.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.055
Um, of whom?

17:37.275 --> 17:39.218
I mean, of yourself?

17:39.278 --> 17:44.725
What I wish to be and what I see in others that I admire.

17:45.066 --> 17:49.371
Because there are plenty of people that are, I mean, Thorne is not an exaggeration.

17:49.391 --> 17:55.299
There are plenty of people that are better than he is in many ways in living that life that he lives.

17:55.319 --> 17:59.545
I mean, this guy that built his house out of these packing crates, um,

18:00.757 --> 18:06.826
He doesn't have any plumbing or any electricity.

18:06.906 --> 18:13.495
He lives in as primitive a way as a person could possibly live, and he's just a wonderful guy.

18:15.658 --> 18:28.857
Sells his carvings and his wood creations at a little artistic co-op place in Pew Argo, and there are just a whole lot of people like that that are still living lives that are

18:29.917 --> 18:41.875
not counterculture lives, not lives that grow out of whole earth catalogs or anything like that, but lives that are simply self-chosen lives.

18:42.055 --> 18:45.801
They're not chosen from some kind of institutional model.

18:47.363 --> 18:56.076
Wonderful people, interesting people that came there precisely because it's a place that has this history of don't tread on me

18:56.798 --> 19:00.646
I'll be however the hell I want to be.

19:00.666 --> 19:16.138
There is, of course, in all of your books a pretty strong, I don't want to mix my metaphors here, but there is a current of an environmental concern that you certainly express, I think, in all of your books.

19:16.238 --> 19:16.579
That's true.

19:17.133 --> 19:25.182
And are all of these things fairly well researched when you talk about what's happening to the coral reefs and stuff?

19:25.703 --> 19:35.734
I spend, before I actually start, I guess other people do work different ways, but the thing that gets me started, I don't do outlines.

19:35.854 --> 19:39.819
I don't think about who the characters are.

19:39.859 --> 19:44.284
I go out and do what amounts to kind of journalistic research.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.165
I go to the

19:45.938 --> 19:49.863
go to places, research that's kind of like in the mean high tide book.

19:49.884 --> 19:57.394
I went to fish farms and talked to people about salapia, biologists, fish farmers, and so on.

19:57.414 --> 20:06.807
I do library research, computer research, spend usually a month or so going places, meeting people, doing things of that kind.

20:07.088 --> 20:10.292
Like the love of the coral book, I went to a bunch of

20:10.998 --> 20:23.843
multiple sclerosis meetings where the newly diagnosed patients went and talked to neurologists about their disease and just got infected by the emotion

20:24.278 --> 20:48.210
nature of this you know is that pretty much i mean is that is that i'm going back to the coral book i remember that that was caused by uh i mean purportedly these diseases were caused by illegal dumping it well that's because i recollect i never actually make that uh firm connection because it's not it's not clear and it's still not not discovered what the root cause of

20:48.376 --> 20:49.037
MS is.

20:49.137 --> 20:49.697
Nobody knows.

20:49.717 --> 20:52.840
But I mean, so much of it in this, but that is documented, though.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.082
Is that where you have other cases where you have?

20:55.363 --> 21:05.332
There are documentations of this aerial spraying that took place in Key West that the military did of this particular bacteria.

21:05.873 --> 21:12.920
And yes, the dumping, the high incidence of MS does exist way, way out of proportion to what it should.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.281
Yeah, so you have that.

21:14.501 --> 21:15.362
All that's true.

21:15.781 --> 21:22.277
It's also true that there's a real high incidence of MS around the garbage dump at the hospital.

21:22.358 --> 21:27.170
The nurses at the hospital have an extraordinarily high incidence of MS.

21:27.190 --> 21:30.398
So, you know, there are lots of little physical evidence, but I can't.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.630
In good conscience, I can't make the final job.

21:33.650 --> 21:35.973
Yeah, well, it's a novel, too.

21:37.274 --> 21:38.216
You have this license.

21:38.716 --> 21:39.617
Yeah, thank God.

21:40.839 --> 21:43.021
Now, that was not a Thorne book, as I recall.

21:43.061 --> 21:45.845
Right, that was Doug Yenelmeyer and a guy named Shaw Chandler.

21:45.865 --> 21:47.046
But I thought he was Thorne.

21:47.467 --> 21:48.468
He was Thorne-like.

21:48.608 --> 21:54.235
He was based on a guy, a fishing buddy of mine, who's a paramedic that I go out with all the time.

21:54.475 --> 21:55.997
I just love this guy.

21:56.686 --> 22:01.070
I had a sense, no, you had left Norton, I think that book was with Knopf.

22:01.090 --> 22:03.492
That was with Knopf, yeah.

22:03.512 --> 22:10.599
And when I was very, the first two foreign books with Norton, they used a modification of the same jacket.

22:11.720 --> 22:11.860
Right.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.441
Which I thought was terrific, by the way.

22:15.002 --> 22:15.343
Well, good, yeah.

22:15.363 --> 22:17.885
And, of course, they probably own it right over at Norton.

22:19.166 --> 22:19.446
Yeah, they do.

22:19.467 --> 22:26.693
But what I thought I was doing is, I didn't write about it, but I said this could almost be a publishing company

22:26.673 --> 22:32.018
kind of product identification, you know, where you get to... I think that's what they had in mind.

22:32.438 --> 22:40.426
And it's just that Sonny Mehta was real interested in luring me away and off getting some money out and I went over there.

22:40.486 --> 22:43.429
And otherwise, Norton had been wonderful to me.

22:43.449 --> 22:48.574
And I think that was a very good idea of trying to have a uniform package.

22:48.634 --> 22:53.018
I've probably been hurt in the long run by not letting them...

22:54.010 --> 22:56.894
you know, continue that build the way they were doing it.

22:57.354 --> 22:59.697
But now I've found home with Delacorte.

22:59.718 --> 23:03.743
I mean, these people, they're trying to find that same uniform package.

23:05.105 --> 23:08.229
They're much, much better than anybody I've been with.

23:08.269 --> 23:15.238
Why did you decide to, was there a contractual thing with Norton, why you didn't do the next book or so about Ford?

23:15.258 --> 23:20.625
Yeah, I'd run through the whole course of the contract with them, and then I would,

23:21.297 --> 23:22.499
up for grabs.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.443
Actually, they rejected Buns of Coral.

23:24.463 --> 23:25.125
They didn't like it.

23:25.546 --> 23:25.846
Really?

23:25.987 --> 23:26.928
Which released me.

23:27.610 --> 23:28.412
Oh.

23:28.652 --> 23:29.814
So that was the option book.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.400
They had the first option.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.522
They rejected it.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.203
They didn't like it.

23:34.223 --> 23:35.526
They thought it was too violent.

23:36.097 --> 23:39.141
You do leave a lot of blood on the carpet.

23:39.161 --> 23:42.906
I know, I know, and I'm trying to improve on that.

23:42.926 --> 23:45.809
I mean, come on, Shakespeare leaves a lot of bodies on the table.

23:45.829 --> 23:48.753
Titus Andronicus, right?

23:48.773 --> 23:51.116
Imagine if that's the only play you ever wrote.

23:51.136 --> 23:53.499
I didn't invent the blood thing.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.561
I mean, there's always been blood on the carpet.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.788
I mean, they deliver heads, don't they, in Titus Andronicus?

24:02.084 --> 24:08.032
Well, I just read this new bestseller, you know, the one, The Day After Tomorrow.

24:08.272 --> 24:08.993
Oh, yeah.

24:09.374 --> 24:10.816
Well, I've heard mixed things.

24:10.996 --> 24:12.418
I tell you, I read it.

24:12.438 --> 24:13.339
I read the whole thing.

24:14.781 --> 24:18.366
But I do not get all this hype.

24:18.466 --> 24:21.831
That's my friend, Les Dandiford, who reviews...

24:22.537 --> 24:24.359
He reviews for the Chicago Tribune.

24:24.459 --> 24:28.883
He wrote a review for Newsday on that book, and he hated it.

24:28.903 --> 24:37.851
I'm telling you, I'm writing for a number of newspapers, by the way, and they want me to do this magazine on Long Island I'm going to be writing for this summer.

24:38.832 --> 24:42.295
I'm starting off with a... I don't have to tape this, do I?

24:42.475 --> 24:43.836
I'm going to check.

24:43.896 --> 24:47.360
That's great.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.240
Okay, here we are.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.221
We're back live.

24:49.501 --> 24:50.302
We're back live.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.324
So...

24:54.295 --> 24:55.736
Where were we?

24:55.756 --> 24:56.817
Where do we pick up the thread?

24:57.979 --> 25:08.168
Have they done any movies of... I mean, I should think this would be a pretty interesting... They've gone through the process on all of them and somewhere else.

25:08.188 --> 25:10.831
They've all been optioned.

25:10.851 --> 25:16.556
And the farthest along, in the help of God, was Bones of Quirrell that was with MGM.

25:16.576 --> 25:18.338
And they had a script.

25:18.899 --> 25:21.661
I wrote the first couple drafts of scripts and they fired me.

25:22.362 --> 25:23.543
It was too close to the book.

25:23.523 --> 25:39.383
I wouldn't do what they wanted me to do, which was to cut Dougie and Elmira totally from the movie, which was, you know, they said that Kevin Costner or Tom Cruise would never be in the movie if they knew that there was a character that had more interesting lines.

25:41.826 --> 25:51.758
Anyway, they got a director, Hugh Hudson, who did Chariots of Fire, British director, very good, went on campaign war, a stylish guy.

25:52.447 --> 26:15.376
They got a script they liked, everybody was happy about it, and it got all the way up to Alan Ladd, Jr., who was then the president of GM, and he turned the project down because they had left out what, to him, was a major aspect of the story, which was basically Alan Ladd's story, a story about a son forgiving his father for being abusive and neglecting him.

26:15.396 --> 26:16.557
Now, can I interject?

26:16.678 --> 26:20.142
It seems to me you're knocking off some pretty important characters.

26:23.497 --> 26:27.301
I thought Darcy was going to be around for a couple of books.

26:28.502 --> 26:34.488
Well, see, my feeling is I've got lots of characters left.

26:34.668 --> 26:40.113
And also, if you don't care about who dies, then it's just a generic body on the rug.

26:41.094 --> 26:43.276
If you're not emotionally hooked.

26:43.296 --> 26:45.679
I tried my best to keep Darcy alive.

26:45.739 --> 26:49.082
In fact, the first draft of that was Darcy was alive.

26:49.585 --> 26:51.027
But she was in a coma.

26:51.769 --> 26:52.490
Well, forget it.

26:52.910 --> 26:53.511
It didn't work.

26:53.531 --> 26:57.218
We don't want a vegetative Darcy.

26:57.238 --> 26:57.378
I know.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.660
I mean, she was going to come out of it.

26:58.680 --> 27:05.451
But the question was, how do you keep her alive but not have her spill her guts and tell the secret and short-circuit the whole story?

27:05.617 --> 27:10.123
And, you know, so you have all these scenes with Thorne looking at her vinyl signs.

27:10.143 --> 27:10.724
Big deal.

27:10.744 --> 27:11.745
No, that doesn't, yeah.

27:12.546 --> 27:13.547
There was no drama there.

27:13.567 --> 27:14.589
There was no excitement there.

27:15.430 --> 27:16.351
So she had to die.

27:16.411 --> 27:16.872
She had to go.

27:17.072 --> 27:18.073
Yeah, she had to go.

27:18.213 --> 27:22.259
I had her, at one point, she cut off her hand, you know, back up.

27:22.279 --> 27:23.000
Oh, Christ.

27:23.340 --> 27:26.564
To get free of that bull and died on the way up.

27:26.644 --> 27:29.849
And this was this heroic, grim, terrible thing.

27:29.989 --> 27:32.552
But I thought I'd just let her drown instead of...

27:34.253 --> 27:36.277
You know what I have to complain about?

27:36.598 --> 27:36.698
Yeah.

27:36.718 --> 27:37.500
The dust jacket.

27:38.683 --> 27:40.086
Not the dust jacket, but the blurb.

27:40.527 --> 27:41.809
Oh, which one?

27:41.909 --> 27:45.537
I mean, I really resent dust jackets inside the things that happen.

27:45.738 --> 27:46.339
Oh, yeah.

27:47.669 --> 27:49.351
You know, the author should write the blurbs.

27:50.432 --> 27:57.519
Would you have put on the blurb that Darcy's, that I guess it's necessary, but it happens pretty early in the book anyway.

27:57.639 --> 28:04.927
It's a second chapter, but still, I don't know who, I don't get a right to okay those or anything.

28:05.147 --> 28:07.469
I don't have any input in any of that stuff.

28:07.489 --> 28:10.052
They just go on every day.

28:10.072 --> 28:11.894
You think you've got plenty of stories for this guy?

28:12.795 --> 28:15.077
Well, I've got a new book.

28:15.293 --> 28:18.619
that I'm just finishing up, and he's a supporting character.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.367
Thorne is a ride to the rescue.

28:22.607 --> 28:34.831
He sort of is in there, but it's a woman whose story is mainly about, and she catches animal smugglers, and that's why I was over in Borneo and stuff.

28:35.051 --> 28:37.977
Miami, as it turns out, is also

28:38.969 --> 28:43.333
we're very good at being an importation point for wild animals.

28:43.673 --> 28:44.394
Lots of parrots.

28:44.734 --> 28:47.517
Yeah, parrots, well, all kinds, primates, you name it.

28:48.058 --> 28:50.280
It comes through Miami.

28:50.300 --> 28:58.668
Because they're so geared up to look for drugs, they don't give a shit too much about orangutans or whatever else.

28:59.168 --> 29:01.891
These little harmless creatures, what the heck.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.533
Anyway, so Thorne is in the next story.

29:05.354 --> 29:07.356
You know, the problem, of course, is that

29:07.741 --> 29:10.105
I never intended him to be a serious character.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.831
He's too much of a curmudgeon and a strong guy.

29:13.971 --> 29:16.736
He's not a private eye.

29:16.756 --> 29:22.446
It kind of strains credulity for him to... To have so many things working on in Key Largo, no less.

29:22.466 --> 29:23.187
Terrible things.

29:23.207 --> 29:23.808
Yeah, right.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.773
In Key Largo, in this very sheltered life.

29:27.073 --> 29:29.638
I have all these terrible things keep happening.

29:29.658 --> 29:29.918
So...

29:30.725 --> 29:45.427
My job, as I see it, if I choose to accept it, is to, if I'm going to continue with Dorn and not do violence to his character, is to find a way to make him a little more available to future problems.

29:45.447 --> 29:54.640
I was kind of angling with that in Mean High Tide to set Sugarman up with this PI, this broken down PI firm.

29:55.075 --> 29:59.379
so that maybe it's through Sugarman that these things spill over into Dorne's life.

29:59.880 --> 30:00.420
I don't know.

30:00.440 --> 30:00.961
I'm not sure.

30:01.021 --> 30:06.846
But you're wrestling with a delightful problem as a popular continuing character.

30:07.087 --> 30:16.255
Well, it seems to me more realistic and more of the problem that most people have, which is why to get up off the couch.

30:16.796 --> 30:20.880
Which call do we accept?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.142
What stirs us into action?

30:23.476 --> 30:27.201
That's more the contemporary problem than it is.

30:27.221 --> 30:33.090
The private eye is just with his feet up on the desk waiting for the next problem to come in the door, ready to jump up and do it.

30:33.270 --> 30:35.874
And to me, that's not real.

30:36.515 --> 30:43.925
The real thing is, why should we do anything at all when we've got 50 channels we could be watching and things that we can order in?

30:44.526 --> 30:52.217
And I mean, Thorne doesn't have that problem, but his problem is similar to that in a more rustic way.

30:52.957 --> 30:53.838
before I get involved.

No, I still, I'm teaching one course one day a week at the university just to keep my hand in.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.015
Keep my health insurance active.

As a full-time freelancer now.

You are full-time now?

31:17.683 --> 31:18.604
Well, not in the news.
