00:02.917 --> 00:04.339
You want to put it on?

00:04.539 --> 00:06.161
Okay, we're talking to Fred Schreiber.

00:06.302 --> 00:07.844
Okay, I'll just put this over here.

00:07.884 --> 00:15.314
Yeah, if you have questions, I will tell you if they're answered in my autobiographical schedule.

00:15.334 --> 00:16.676
If they're not, I will answer them now.

00:16.736 --> 00:19.280
I'm sure, you know, when you came here.

00:19.660 --> 00:24.587
Yes, not a year, but it was 1953.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.109
How old were you?

00:26.129 --> 00:30.776
I was 17, a few months past 17.

00:30.836 --> 00:33.440
So you hadn't really attended university at all?

00:33.560 --> 00:36.644
That is all answered in Maya Tabaga.

00:36.664 --> 00:37.766
Believe me when I tell you.

00:37.786 --> 00:41.592
Okay, but what were your intentions for yourself at that point?

00:41.692 --> 00:45.377
I'm only going to repeat what you need to read.

00:46.623 --> 00:48.525
I was not educated when I came here.

00:48.786 --> 00:53.511
I had gone to elementary school, and I quit when I was 14.

00:54.092 --> 00:58.557
I worked as an apprentice tailor in Paris.

01:00.700 --> 01:07.969
But, as I said, this is all what my autobiographical sketch is about.

01:08.529 --> 01:10.372
Well, I know you went to Harvard.

01:10.412 --> 01:11.373
Much later.

01:11.473 --> 01:12.014
Much later.

01:12.034 --> 01:13.475
Well, what did you do when you first came here?

01:13.596 --> 01:14.757
I worked as a shipping clerk.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.505
for several years on the 47th Street.

01:18.825 --> 01:20.167
I hope I'm not rushing you through that.

01:20.207 --> 01:24.073
No, no.

01:24.093 --> 01:25.195
A lemon is optional.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.297
It just looks nice, though.

01:26.317 --> 01:27.999
Yes.

01:28.019 --> 01:39.758
Some cheese and pepper for you, sir.

01:40.519 --> 01:41.200
I'd like a little cheese, I guess.

01:41.922 --> 01:48.292
Yeah, it's very nice.

01:49.775 --> 01:52.659
I worked as a shipping clerk.

01:53.160 --> 01:53.320
Cheese?

01:53.360 --> 01:58.789
Stay right in front of me.

01:58.809 --> 02:00.211
Cheese on your veggies, you're all right?

02:00.231 --> 02:00.672
No, thank you.

02:01.313 --> 02:04.678
You worked as a shipping clerk?

02:05.019 --> 02:05.419
Uh-huh.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.883
Minimum wage job here in New York?

02:08.304 --> 02:08.925
In New York.

02:09.547 --> 02:14.775
From 53 to 1960.

02:15.456 --> 02:17.039
Seven years.

02:17.059 --> 02:17.339
Yes.

02:17.479 --> 02:21.566
So from the age of approximately about 17 to 24.

02:22.447 --> 02:23.008
Yes, correct.

02:23.429 --> 02:33.765
And then from the age of 22 to the age of 24, I went to high school at night.

02:34.252 --> 02:42.283
I started high school when I was about 22 and graduated from high school at night and then went on to college.

02:42.343 --> 02:59.247
I went to Queens College City University of New York and then got a Woodrow Wilson fellowship and I went to Harvard Graduate School where I obtained a PhD in classics in 1970 and I taught for

02:59.446 --> 03:02.170
After that or while you were doing it?

03:02.230 --> 03:02.611
No, no.

03:02.731 --> 03:08.139
After I got my PhD, I taught at Herbert Lehman College, City University of New York.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.403
Became an associate professor.

03:11.264 --> 03:14.028
I was granted tenure.

03:14.048 --> 03:20.218
And then I quit to go into my own business.

03:20.238 --> 03:24.765
The reasons for that are very... I myself don't understand them.

03:25.185 --> 03:28.390
I think it's sort of a midlife crisis.

03:28.876 --> 03:38.247
When I went into the business, I was about 42, 43.

03:38.687 --> 03:41.130
Interesting.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.012
Were you unhappy teaching?

03:43.172 --> 03:43.493
No.

03:43.653 --> 03:46.936
I may say to myself, I was a very popular teacher.

03:47.317 --> 03:47.737
Very good.

03:48.939 --> 03:57.128
But I think when you read my autobiography after the sketch, you will see that the PhD was very important to me because I was uneducated.

03:57.850 --> 04:05.317
And I admired education because it's something that I didn't have and that was another world.

04:06.318 --> 04:15.366
And when I realized that I've wasted all these years, that I could obtain an education, I wanted a PhD even though I didn't really know what it meant.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.148
I just wanted to be called doctor.

04:17.208 --> 04:17.748
It was a goal.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.610
It was a goal.

04:19.630 --> 04:24.435
What I didn't realize is that the goal was what I really wanted.

04:24.495 --> 04:26.997
I wanted a PhD and I didn't think any further than that.

04:27.888 --> 04:34.298
So after teaching for seven or eight years, I realized one day, you know, this is not really what I want to do for the rest of my life.

04:34.419 --> 04:38.385
All I wanted was to make a PhD so I could prove something to myself.

04:38.405 --> 04:39.306
What do I really want to do?

04:39.667 --> 04:41.229
Well, I want to be with books all the time.

04:42.572 --> 04:47.179
And also one element is that I like to be my own boss.

04:48.070 --> 04:54.339
And in a university environment, in an academic environment, you have to answer to many people.

04:54.580 --> 04:57.164
You have to do things that you may not want to do.

04:57.424 --> 04:59.127
And that everybody will do with teaching.

04:59.147 --> 04:59.948
Yes, exactly.

05:03.734 --> 05:10.303
So I think that after I got tenure, I was a little burnt out because there were no more challenges.

05:10.323 --> 05:13.749
I had gotten my associate professorship.

05:13.769 --> 05:14.630
I had gotten my tenure.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.693
I knew the next step was going to be full professorship.

05:17.382 --> 05:18.383
It was not a challenge.

05:18.463 --> 05:19.845
I knew it was just going to come along.

05:20.786 --> 05:23.209
Was the livelihood satisfactory?

05:23.249 --> 05:27.734
Well, I didn't make a lot of money, but it was the most money I ever made in my life.

05:28.274 --> 05:36.324
You know, I was making something like $25,000 a year, which to me was like, coming from where I came from, shipping hurt.

05:38.146 --> 05:39.147
It was like tremendous.

05:40.589 --> 05:46.275
But of course, what you make as a dealer, it doesn't compare to what you made from the professor.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.519
So the motivation wasn't cheap?

05:48.700 --> 05:49.741
It wasn't money.

05:49.761 --> 05:51.382
Was that something to prove yourself financially?

05:51.402 --> 05:52.283
No, absolutely not.

05:52.463 --> 05:57.608
Never occurred to me.

05:59.269 --> 06:01.752
I think it's just that I wanted a change.

06:01.772 --> 06:04.775
I wanted to do... I was a collector all my life.

06:04.795 --> 06:07.717
That's interesting.

06:07.737 --> 06:09.219
And... Here's how we're doing over here.

06:09.319 --> 06:10.620
Can I get you another go on some way?

06:10.640 --> 06:11.321
No, I'm set, thanks.

06:11.781 --> 06:12.302
Okay, very good.

06:13.423 --> 06:13.883
So...

06:15.517 --> 06:20.367
And I wanted to be in my hobbies 24 hours a day.

06:20.387 --> 06:21.088
What did you collect?

06:21.709 --> 06:28.643
I've always collected something, and as I mentioned in my schedule, I started with comic books and stamps, whatever I could afford.

06:28.663 --> 06:35.136
And my big argument is that you don't have to have money to be a collector.

06:35.416 --> 06:37.440
You're a collector or you're not a collector.

06:38.028 --> 06:41.693
And it bothers me when people say, if I had money, I would be a collector.

06:41.753 --> 06:43.275
That makes no sense.

06:43.475 --> 06:43.796
That's absurd.

06:44.076 --> 06:44.517
Totally.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.040
And these people usually have much more money than I have.

06:48.603 --> 06:50.565
So either you're a collector or you're not a collector.

06:50.705 --> 06:55.492
There is no stigma attached to not being a collector.

06:55.512 --> 07:02.682
The analogy I use in my sketch is either you have the flu virus or you don't have it.

07:02.922 --> 07:07.208
There's no stigma attached to it.

07:07.778 --> 07:11.061
And I happened to have the collector's virus.

07:11.081 --> 07:12.382
It's like being a little bit pregnant.

07:12.763 --> 07:13.003
Yes.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.145
That's right.

07:15.886 --> 07:28.197
So I collected... As I advanced in my life's situation, I would collect something more sophisticated, something I could afford better.

07:28.958 --> 07:33.382
So for a long time I collected the books illustrated by Arthur Rackett.

07:34.143 --> 07:35.524
That was my big love.

07:36.432 --> 07:50.256
And then when I went to Harvard, one of my special interests for the PhD was Aristophanes, so I began to collect Aristophanes, which involved me with early books.

07:51.999 --> 07:59.993
And so when I went into my own business, since I had a PhD in classics and that's all I knew, I went into

08:00.226 --> 08:07.113
Early books, or rather, the first catalog I put out was used books in the classics, 20th century, 19th century.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.635
When was this?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.176
Well, I started part-time.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.638
I started about 1971.

08:11.818 --> 08:17.264
I was born in 1935.

08:17.284 --> 08:22.609
So I began to dabble as a hobby with used books.

08:23.751 --> 08:27.955
And I got more and more involved in it.

08:29.369 --> 08:34.276
And eventually decided that's what I would do.

08:34.336 --> 08:35.057
Full time.

08:35.077 --> 08:36.960
And I began full time in 1978.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.523
So I was 43.

08:40.024 --> 08:44.730
And how did you go about finding stuff?

08:44.750 --> 08:47.815
Oh, I went over, well, I bought at auction.

08:48.896 --> 08:56.727
Also, because I had some insights in certain books, I was able to buy from other dealers points that they missed in certain books.

08:58.377 --> 09:04.627
My big strength, I think, in the book business, if I have anything to contribute, is the ability to do research.

09:05.688 --> 09:15.624
And you can uncover some very important things when you read the languages and you are trained as a researcher, academic researcher.

09:15.644 --> 09:18.428
You can make finds.

09:18.695 --> 09:20.959
Anything come to mind, specifically?

09:20.979 --> 09:21.219
Yes.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.305
I know it's hard to ask this myself.

09:24.325 --> 09:41.074
No, no, no, I... What I'll do is I'll give you a description of the book that I... My first catalogue, the first important catalogue, in other words, by important I mean the first catalogue... Let me go back for a second.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.474
Before going into the business full time, what I decided to do is try it out.

09:46.874 --> 09:50.179
And I took a leave of absence from teaching for one year.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.063
So you didn't cross the Wubafone immediately?

09:53.103 --> 09:53.684
No.

09:53.704 --> 09:55.146
I took a leave of absence.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.188
I played it safe.

09:56.208 --> 10:02.938
And we put all our savings into stock, my wife and I. I mean, everything we had was a big gamble.

10:02.958 --> 10:03.839
But I figured this way.

10:04.060 --> 10:06.483
If it doesn't work out, I'll go back to teaching next year.

10:06.804 --> 10:07.805
And I've lost nothing.

10:09.047 --> 10:10.369
If it works out, I'll quit.

10:10.518 --> 10:12.881
and I'll go into the book business.

10:12.901 --> 10:16.647
So, we put all our money into this catalogue.

10:16.927 --> 10:19.090
Did you buy very shrewdly?

10:19.110 --> 10:20.873
Well, I didn't know until the catalogue would come out.

10:20.893 --> 10:21.574
It was a gamble.

10:23.216 --> 10:26.180
Although the gambling element is something that feels to me too, you know.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.382
It's incredible.

10:27.402 --> 10:28.023
Yeah.

10:28.043 --> 10:33.230
So, I'll tell you in a second what the fine was in that catalogue.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.154
In any case, the catalogue did very well.

10:36.387 --> 10:45.524
I had asked around booksellers, what constitutes success when they put out a catalogue?

10:46.786 --> 10:50.233
And they said, well, if a catalogue sells 40%, it's very good.

10:51.195 --> 10:53.078
How soon?

10:53.138 --> 10:56.264
I guess within a month or two of it.

10:56.304 --> 10:57.366
I would think so.

10:58.342 --> 10:59.744
Oh, it's broken even, probably.

10:59.864 --> 11:00.845
You mark up this 50%.

11:01.025 --> 11:01.325
Yeah.

11:01.425 --> 11:06.491
40% of the books and the value is supposedly a big success.

11:06.511 --> 11:07.813
So that's what I was aiming for.

11:08.253 --> 11:11.697
Put out this catalogue, and it sold maybe 60%.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.619
So to me that was success.

11:13.819 --> 11:16.522
However, I couldn't decide.

11:17.383 --> 11:23.550
Suppose my next catalogue doesn't do as well, and I lost my tenure, I lost all my benefits.

11:24.311 --> 11:25.412
I mean, this was a big...

11:26.118 --> 11:29.523
You haven't lost these things yet?

11:29.603 --> 11:29.803
No.

11:30.264 --> 11:37.214
I was supposed to call the chairman of my department to tell him in April 1979 whether I was coming back in September or not.

11:39.438 --> 11:45.827
And I couldn't call him because I couldn't decide, you know?

11:47.309 --> 11:48.932
So he called me.

11:49.172 --> 11:49.833
I was in April 1979.

11:50.013 --> 11:54.420
Fred, are you coming back in September?

11:55.221 --> 11:55.922
And I knew that

11:56.932 --> 12:02.557
The answer I was going to be given, yes or no, was going to seal my fate.

12:03.037 --> 12:06.260
If I said yes, then I would never be a bookseller.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.962
I would always be a professor.

12:08.983 --> 12:10.644
If I said no, I would lose tenure.

12:10.664 --> 12:15.008
I mean, forget about it, career.

12:15.148 --> 12:17.450
This is a momentous moment.

12:17.811 --> 12:18.972
So he calls me up.

12:18.992 --> 12:21.234
Are you coming back in September?

12:21.254 --> 12:22.515
And I couldn't answer.

12:22.555 --> 12:26.078
But I heard a voice in me.

12:26.986 --> 12:30.509
I was in the kitchen, I remember, on the phone, and I said, no, I'm not coming back.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.131
And as though it was somebody else talking.

12:33.271 --> 12:33.772
It wasn't me.

12:34.452 --> 12:36.074
I just heard, no, I'm not coming back.

12:36.734 --> 12:40.818
And that's it.

12:40.838 --> 12:42.199
From that day on, I was a bookseller.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.841
Did you discuss it with your wife at that point?

12:44.861 --> 12:46.283
She was very encouraging.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.907
If I hadn't, if she wasn't, I wouldn't have done it.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.468
Even though I have.

12:52.968 --> 12:56.031
Because I'm very diffident,

12:56.146 --> 13:00.470
I would never have been able to make a decision, but my wife has more confidence in me than I do.

13:01.111 --> 13:06.457
So, with her help... I quit a job five and a half years ago.

13:06.477 --> 13:10.781
I had two small daughters at the time, and I was six months prior by 20 years.

13:10.841 --> 13:16.707
You're not regretting it.

13:17.048 --> 13:18.189
Exactly.

13:18.249 --> 13:20.331
Well, that's the same thing with me.

13:20.615 --> 13:21.657
I'm 53 now.

13:21.677 --> 13:22.679
I did this at 48.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.723
I wish I'd done it when I was 42.

13:25.324 --> 13:27.027
Same age as you.

13:27.488 --> 13:28.410
I had a daughter.

13:28.430 --> 13:29.472
I had a mortgage.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.897
So it wasn't easy.

13:31.917 --> 13:38.149
But I must admit that my wife gets all the credit for any success I may have had.

13:38.169 --> 13:40.513
Read the acknowledgements in my book and I say,

13:40.797 --> 13:43.743
I'll send you this Boston Globe piece.

13:44.043 --> 13:50.996
Because it wasn't just the fact that she says do it, it's the fact that she gives you moral permission to do it.

13:51.016 --> 13:52.840
You have to believe that.

13:52.860 --> 13:57.429
There's only one person in the world who thought I was doing the right thing by quitting my job, and that was my wife.

13:57.729 --> 14:02.839
My parents who helped us, my brother, all these people thought I was nuts.

14:02.819 --> 14:05.021
I was getting paid very well.

14:05.041 --> 14:09.686
I was a book reviewer, a journalist, getting paid well, full benefits.

14:09.706 --> 14:14.911
And then I said, you know, I'm going to be a chump if I do this for the rest of my life.

14:14.931 --> 14:23.879
I've got it in me to write a good book, and I've got the ability to do it, and I'll forever wonder what I did with my life.

14:25.681 --> 14:29.044
And my wife, God bless her, should read.

14:29.064 --> 14:32.067
You know, there's a whole bunch of people we call

14:34.645 --> 14:39.292
I would have, if I could, but we said we could.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.154
We just did it.

14:40.174 --> 14:42.437
And don't be afraid to fail, too.

14:42.998 --> 14:43.319
Yes.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.322
That's part of the equation.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.203
It can go either way.

14:46.284 --> 14:47.666
There's no guarantees in this world.

14:47.966 --> 14:57.021
You know, John Chancellor, who died, I knew him in his obituary, I don't know if it was in the Times' obituary, but he battled cancer for some time.

14:57.421 --> 15:01.007
But the final quote in the obituary was, John Chancellor said,

15:01.139 --> 15:02.180
He quoted somebody else.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.305
He said, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

15:07.728 --> 15:09.090
Think about that.

15:09.110 --> 15:09.591
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:09.611 --> 15:14.498
Tell him the way you've got your life figured out, how it's going to go, how everything's going to turn out.

15:15.038 --> 15:22.689
Well, you know, the cliché life is what happens when you make other plans.

15:22.709 --> 15:23.991
Yeah.

15:24.578 --> 15:27.142
Life is what happens to you when you have made other plans.

15:27.202 --> 15:28.464
So we're kind of in sync here.

15:28.564 --> 15:29.605
Yeah, yeah.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.767
I respect that so much.

15:32.590 --> 15:33.671
So let's get back then.

15:33.691 --> 15:35.614
You're telling me about this first catalogue.

15:35.634 --> 15:36.375
Yeah, okay.

15:36.576 --> 15:39.300
It kind of has a sleeper title in it, apparently.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.182
Well, it did very well.

15:41.222 --> 15:45.308
But one item... How did you track Tesla's value?

15:46.069 --> 15:49.955
I bought the library directory.

15:49.975 --> 15:53.320
I sent to every library that I could think of.

15:53.738 --> 15:54.519
I had no idea.

15:55.080 --> 15:55.982
Just a hit and miss.

15:56.643 --> 15:57.865
I had no private collectors.

15:59.848 --> 16:05.537
And I advertised and I got some names.

16:08.221 --> 16:14.872
One of the books that did very well in the catalog, by very well meaning that I got about ten orders for it, which is very unusual.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.337
And no book ever gets that kind of... You love it if you get one.

16:18.397 --> 16:20.200
Which tells you probably had the first one.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.282
Yes.

16:21.464 --> 16:25.928
But, I mean, the main thing is I made my money in it, and I'm not worried about it.

16:25.948 --> 16:27.229
Well, I'll tell you what it was.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.191
It was an incunable.

16:31.553 --> 16:35.457
And it was a theological incunable.

16:35.477 --> 16:39.760
I'll give you a clipping of the description so you'll know what it is.

16:39.780 --> 16:47.728
And it was known that the book contains, it was in Latin, that it contained a few English phrases.

16:47.788 --> 16:49.049
So I bought it for that.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.471
Because it was unusual.

16:51.957 --> 16:55.082
I paid $1,800 for it.

16:55.162 --> 16:58.488
I'm telling you the price because it's important.

16:58.548 --> 17:04.859
I remember I was making $25,000 a year or something.

17:04.919 --> 17:08.324
It was a big money for me.

17:10.067 --> 17:15.997
I decided that the English sounded very biblical to me.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.842
The book was printed in 1480.

17:19.733 --> 17:24.118
could it be quotations of the Bible?

17:24.358 --> 17:40.216
The context was quoting students at Cambridge or Oxford swearing their oaths by Christ's blogging, you know, as in Old English.

17:40.237 --> 17:45.523
So I checked and checked and sure enough I found it was a quotation from the New Testament.

17:46.964 --> 17:47.665
When was

17:48.168 --> 17:52.636
When was the earliest printing of any portion of the Bible in English?

17:52.776 --> 17:53.618
Well, this might be it.

17:54.880 --> 18:01.051
So my heading was possibly the earliest printed quotation of the Bible in English.

18:02.393 --> 18:08.484
I made the book, I think, 4250 or 4500, you'll see it in the clipping.

18:09.185 --> 18:13.112
Because, I mean, I wrote a very long description proving my point.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.558
And I began to get orders for that book.

18:15.658 --> 18:16.339
I couldn't believe it.

18:16.479 --> 18:19.321
The first order came from the bookseller, Larry Whitton.

18:19.942 --> 18:20.683
You know him?

18:20.783 --> 18:23.645
He's dead now.

18:23.665 --> 18:27.649
And I began to get orders from every bookseller in the world, you know?

18:28.350 --> 18:29.170
And some libraries.

18:29.190 --> 18:31.393
But do you think they knew the book or were they buying it on the screen?

18:31.413 --> 18:38.239
No, because you see, I didn't have... What I was lacking is... The biography?

18:38.259 --> 18:40.561
No, I didn't know the business.

18:40.761 --> 18:41.842
I didn't know what sold.

18:42.062 --> 18:42.863
I didn't know...

18:43.973 --> 18:50.340
They were the veterans who knew that a book like this can sell very easily.

18:50.380 --> 18:50.801
I didn't know.

18:50.841 --> 18:53.203
I was just... Just because of the things you found?

18:53.223 --> 18:53.444
Yeah.

18:54.265 --> 18:56.427
What you did is you identified the selling points.

18:56.447 --> 18:56.667
Yeah.

18:57.148 --> 19:01.353
But I didn't know... Yeah, but I didn't know that.

19:01.813 --> 19:04.236
I didn't know if I would get any orders, but these guys knew.

19:04.316 --> 19:05.277
They'd know the market.

19:05.357 --> 19:06.138
I didn't know the market.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.102
But you discovered something about the books that made it attractive.

19:10.343 --> 19:10.543
Yes.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.445
So Larry Whitten buys it.

19:13.167 --> 19:15.791
Did he call immediately?

19:16.051 --> 19:17.634
Yes, he was the first to call.

19:18.095 --> 19:24.264
Puts it in his catalogue, with my description, about three months later, I can show you that too, $16,500.

19:24.284 --> 19:26.207
No, that's okay.

19:26.388 --> 19:28.751
I mean, don't begrudging, because he knew the market.

19:29.512 --> 19:31.796
I mean, he knew the market, which I didn't know.

19:31.816 --> 19:35.682
He had knowledgeable power in this business, and he knew something I didn't know.

19:36.978 --> 19:39.004
And the book is now at the Pierpon Morgan Library.

19:39.065 --> 19:39.586
That book?

19:39.707 --> 19:39.907
Yeah.

19:40.028 --> 19:41.151
For very costly.

19:41.211 --> 19:41.954
Yeah.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.863
I mean, I didn't sell it to the Morgan, but he did at $60,500.

19:44.923 --> 19:50.059
Well, just to go back and use a little hindsight and then also project it.

19:50.512 --> 19:53.394
Do you think it was your description that got it into the Morgan Library?

19:53.415 --> 19:53.955
Yes, of course.

19:54.175 --> 19:56.317
It was what you had discovered about this.

19:56.377 --> 19:56.457
Yes.

19:56.477 --> 19:58.899
Otherwise, it might have just been another, just another inculable.

19:58.919 --> 19:59.560
Absolutely.

20:00.080 --> 20:00.300
Yeah.

20:00.321 --> 20:02.923
But you discovered something in there in English.

20:03.083 --> 20:03.303
Yes.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.604
That related to the New Testament.

20:04.624 --> 20:14.813
If I had described the book and not, if I had not found what I just, if I had not made a discovery and had mentioned it in my description, I don't know if I would have gotten any orders.

20:15.614 --> 20:16.575
But these people knew.

20:16.595 --> 20:20.518
I mean, perhaps the earliest quotation, you know,

20:20.785 --> 20:22.207
Do you remember the title of the book?

20:22.247 --> 20:26.452
Yes, it's a book by a man named Michael of Hungary, but I'll give you the flipping.

20:26.633 --> 20:27.274
I love the story.

20:28.535 --> 20:31.559
This is a great story.

20:34.944 --> 20:45.898
This reinforced my feeling, well, I know how to do research, but what I don't know is I don't know the market, I don't know the business, I don't know who buys what, I don't know what sells, and this only comes with experience.

20:46.182 --> 20:48.344
And gradually I learned that too.

20:49.065 --> 20:54.810
I don't know everything yet, but... How do you feel when something like that happens?

20:54.850 --> 20:55.531
Wonderful, right?

20:56.272 --> 21:06.121
Yes, especially since I had taken such a gamble, it reinforces your choice, you know?

21:06.942 --> 21:09.804
I mean... Do you remember where you found the book?

21:09.824 --> 21:10.065
Yes.

21:10.825 --> 21:11.806
Without naming names?

21:11.886 --> 21:15.750
Yeah, I bought it from a dealer, a small dealer.

21:16.523 --> 21:21.349
who undoubtedly had sold it for $1,800.

21:21.569 --> 21:23.972
He knew there was English in it.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.354
He did his work.

21:26.615 --> 21:30.560
How did it occur to you that this might be the first reference?

21:30.600 --> 21:34.425
What about your educational background?

21:34.565 --> 21:42.575
Where did the element of perception come in?

21:42.876 --> 21:45.619
I can't retrace my thought pattern at the time.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.833
Just a hunch.

21:47.853 --> 21:51.619
And when I found the quote in the Bible, I said, this is it.

21:52.621 --> 21:59.091
And then I decided to capitalize on it and see if that sort of thing impresses anyone.

21:59.111 --> 21:59.572
I didn't know.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.135
I was working with that.

22:01.155 --> 22:03.799
Did you try and find prior printed versions?

22:04.580 --> 22:05.161
Yes.

22:05.181 --> 22:06.263
How did you do that?

22:06.423 --> 22:11.792
Well, I checked every caxton that had been printed.

22:12.363 --> 22:18.129
and the possibility of them being any biblical quotation.

22:18.689 --> 22:22.913
And the only one I found, the only possibility, was later than 1480.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.057
You'll see all this in my mind.

22:26.077 --> 22:28.819
So anything after 1480 is quite irrelevant.

22:28.839 --> 22:29.200
It doesn't matter.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.541
Yeah, exactly.

22:30.561 --> 22:34.685
If you could find something before 1480, then my theory was shocked.

22:35.005 --> 22:35.306
That's right.

22:35.326 --> 22:40.170
But obviously these dealers who had been in the business for a long time... They responded.

22:40.431 --> 22:41.131
Yeah, they knew.

22:41.312 --> 22:41.712
I mean...

22:43.058 --> 22:43.719
I made my money.

22:43.739 --> 22:44.341
I'm very happy.

22:44.581 --> 22:47.146
I mean, I made more than double, so I'm not begrudging.

22:47.607 --> 22:51.715
Larry sold to the Morgan Library, or Eric ultimately got to the Morgan Library?

22:51.735 --> 22:53.178
No, he sold it to the Morgan Library.

22:53.218 --> 22:54.360
So they paid $16,500?

22:54.380 --> 22:54.661
$16,500.

22:55.903 --> 22:57.326
I'll show you his capital.

22:57.607 --> 23:02.316
So I have to believe that the people there understood the odds.

23:02.684 --> 23:08.632
Well, I don't know on what basis he sold it to them, because I didn't really have any relationships with librarians.

23:08.692 --> 23:10.094
I didn't know what they looked for.

23:10.875 --> 23:14.039
I was working in a sort of darkness.

23:14.059 --> 23:14.500
A vacuum.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.623
Yeah, yeah.

23:16.643 --> 23:29.400
And, you know, but once I said no, and I'm not coming back in September, then I began to get a little... I became...

23:31.034 --> 23:35.238
much more concerned with the business aspect, how to survive.

23:36.039 --> 23:41.423
It's good to be a scholar, but that's not going to... I understand.

23:41.443 --> 23:46.488
I have a good week this week, but I have to make a buck next week as a freelancer.

23:47.629 --> 23:47.949
Great.

23:49.050 --> 23:53.494
The other thing that happened, and I don't know if this should be mentioned... I'll try it.

23:53.554 --> 23:55.496
I'm not sure that I want to.

23:56.537 --> 24:00.721
When my catalog came out, I got a call from H.P.

24:00.741 --> 24:01.041
Krause.

24:01.561 --> 24:04.624
Not from him personally, but from Roland Holter.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.267
And I don't want the name mentioned.

24:07.287 --> 24:07.408
H.P.

24:07.428 --> 24:10.051
would like to see you.

24:10.071 --> 24:14.235
So, I went there.

24:15.897 --> 24:16.998
Roland took me up to H.P.

24:20.122 --> 24:22.845
And, okay Roland, you can leave us now.

24:23.526 --> 24:27.830
Very nice catalog you put up, Mr. Schweitzer.

24:27.850 --> 24:28.571
Thank you very much.

24:29.232 --> 24:30.994
Now remember, it's my first catalog.

24:31.193 --> 24:34.218
I just gave up tenure and I'm just embarking on a new life.

24:34.678 --> 24:35.279
You're a kid.

24:35.299 --> 24:36.862
I don't care if you're 42.

24:36.922 --> 24:37.423
Yeah, exactly.

24:37.443 --> 24:46.537
I'm starting with all kinds of questions and uncertainties.

24:47.178 --> 24:50.423
I mean, in my mind, am I going to survive in this?

24:50.463 --> 24:51.524
Did I make a big mistake?

24:51.544 --> 24:52.506
Is it going to happen again?

24:53.467 --> 24:59.817
He said, Roland, take Mr. Schreiber to the third floor to show him the manuscripts.

25:00.522 --> 25:05.349
Maybe he wants to sell me things, he doesn't realize I'm a poor schlep, I don't have any money, you know.

25:05.369 --> 25:11.337
So Roland shows me, and then he brings me down again, and HB says to Roland, now you can leave us alone, Roland.

25:12.218 --> 25:13.460
Did you like my manuscripts?

25:14.241 --> 25:14.822
I said, yes.

25:15.302 --> 25:17.706
I had no idea what he was after.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.288
Would you like to help me describe them?

25:21.110 --> 25:22.392
So I said, what do you mean?

25:24.375 --> 25:25.636
I'm offering you a job.

25:26.978 --> 25:27.559
I said...

25:30.239 --> 25:32.001
working for H.P.

25:32.021 --> 25:32.161
Trials.

25:32.301 --> 25:35.384
I was thrilled.

25:37.547 --> 25:38.728
I couldn't answer.

25:39.048 --> 25:41.951
Did this also involve giving up your business?

25:42.051 --> 25:42.872
We didn't come to that.

25:42.892 --> 25:44.154
I'm just telling you exactly how it does.

25:44.354 --> 25:46.917
I go, I pay good.

25:48.278 --> 25:49.219
He says.

25:49.239 --> 25:50.360
Automatically, I said, how much?

25:51.001 --> 25:51.582
I don't know why.

25:51.862 --> 25:53.724
That's a very clear question.

25:53.744 --> 25:57.748
I'm assuming that he must have looked up what an associate professor makes

25:58.876 --> 25:59.937
and a city university.

26:00.318 --> 26:02.701
He says, $25,000?

26:02.721 --> 26:10.250
$28,000, he says, without me asking anything.

26:10.270 --> 26:13.714
And I'm going, well, maybe more, he says.

26:13.755 --> 26:21.104
Now I'm getting into a range where I've never been before, you know, as far as salary is concerned.

26:21.224 --> 26:22.946
And it's seductive.

26:22.966 --> 26:25.389
Of course, my head is like going like this.

26:25.409 --> 26:28.613
So I said, well, think about it, he says.

26:29.487 --> 26:33.794
So I went home and told my wife, H.P.

26:33.814 --> 26:36.177
Krasso offered me a job today.

26:36.197 --> 26:36.498
Really?

26:37.359 --> 26:44.591
He's willing to pay me like, he said 28, but he said maybe more, which means like 30, you know, I've never made that kind of money.

26:46.113 --> 26:54.606
My wife, who is very much planted on the ground, is not emotional like I am, says, why did you want to go into this business?

26:55.327 --> 26:55.748
Why?

26:56.183 --> 26:56.864
be my own boss.

26:57.364 --> 26:57.745
That's it.

26:58.185 --> 26:59.166
Do you want to work for H.P.

26:59.206 --> 27:01.789
Krause or do you want to be your own boss?

27:03.030 --> 27:04.171
So I wrote a letter to H.P.

27:04.191 --> 27:04.471
Krause.

27:04.592 --> 27:16.744
Mr. Krause, I was extremely flattered and honored by your offer, but as I'm sure you will understand, the reason that I gave up my academic career is that I wanted to be my own person and boss.

27:16.944 --> 27:21.249
And even though I'm very flattered, I cannot accept.

27:21.269 --> 27:24.672
And I received no answer.

27:25.850 --> 27:29.518
But a few months later, there was a big party at H.P.

27:29.698 --> 27:31.322
Krauss for his 75th birthday.

27:31.622 --> 27:32.244
And you were invited?

27:32.605 --> 27:34.068
And he invited three dealers.

27:34.368 --> 27:36.132
I mean, I shouldn't say three, maybe four.

27:36.453 --> 27:43.909
Letha Pauper, that is Felix Oriens, Jacques Vellocoup, Bernard Bresslauer, and me.

27:44.902 --> 28:08.766
and i like to think it's because he respected my response i don't know i'm just reading into it well but that was it hey he didn't know you at all except for that one yeah but that's something i prefer this is something well i don't want to mention we'll talk about it it's a wonderful story i don't see anything wrong with it at all and there's nothing disparaging about course he offered you a job it's funny because when i came down again

28:08.746 --> 28:10.909
Roland said, did he offer you a job?

28:10.929 --> 28:12.431
He said, how much do you need?

28:12.551 --> 28:13.993
I said, I... I wouldn't get into it.

28:14.013 --> 28:20.423
No, I said to him, I didn't mention that, because I don't know how much... Was he married to Marianne?

28:20.443 --> 28:22.285
No, a long time ago.

28:22.586 --> 28:23.687
This was 1979.

28:24.188 --> 28:26.772
Right after my catalog came out.

28:26.972 --> 28:32.380
The first... You mentioned books.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.683
All it did was reinforce my decision.

28:35.324 --> 28:38.348
I felt that I had made a good choice in going into the book business,

28:38.767 --> 28:44.755
that even if my catalogue went, I still had a job with a big dealer, you know.

28:44.775 --> 28:47.659
Sir, can I take these away for you?

28:47.720 --> 28:48.741
I'm finished.

28:49.121 --> 28:50.443
I'd like some more water in there.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.885
Sure, I can do that for you.

28:51.905 --> 28:54.068
You'd like some coffee, cappuccino, espresso, dessert?

28:54.108 --> 28:54.569
Dessert?

28:54.749 --> 28:56.452
Maybe coffee.

28:56.472 --> 28:57.533
Yeah, I'll have a coffee share.

28:57.713 --> 28:59.516
Sure.

28:59.596 --> 29:01.599
The one yesterday was very good.

29:01.619 --> 29:01.999
Very good.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.680
I still feel it.

29:02.720 --> 29:02.921
Good.

29:03.201 --> 29:03.922
Excellent.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.386
Well, we'll try to keep you going until tomorrow then.

29:06.546 --> 29:07.407
Okay.

29:07.994 --> 29:12.440
Where were we?

29:13.582 --> 29:29.224
Before I forget, even before I came on our tape recorder, I said, do you think that's a fair assumption that this wave of Everbury booksellers did have the kind of impact that Roger started suggesting?

29:29.244 --> 29:37.596
I think so, but I'm not very good at analyzing those movements.

29:38.673 --> 29:51.086
Yes, because they brought with them not only stock of old books, but also a European tradition for the American book business.

29:53.629 --> 29:54.790
That's very important.

29:54.810 --> 29:55.111
Yeah.

29:57.473 --> 30:00.817
Do you think that you practiced in the European tradition?

30:00.837 --> 30:06.503
Yes, because what happened with me is that I read

30:06.938 --> 30:12.347
And I learned my business really from reading catalogues by people like William Salak.

30:12.647 --> 30:13.990
Do you know the name?

30:14.410 --> 30:17.355
It's in my book.

30:19.839 --> 30:21.842
I would read their catalogues and learn.

30:21.902 --> 30:24.427
That's where I really formed my own style.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.590
I mean, I have my own style.

30:27.231 --> 30:28.373
Everyone has his own style.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.615
But I was very influenced by their catalogues.

30:30.635 --> 30:38.977
So when I suggest to you on the way over that maybe a review of the hook seller's catalogues might be an interesting exercise, you would agree with that?

30:38.997 --> 30:39.478
Absolutely.

30:39.819 --> 30:39.999
Yes.

30:40.441 --> 30:43.148
Because there is a level of expertise.

30:43.268 --> 30:43.729
Yes.

30:44.013 --> 30:48.980
And not just the prices, you can take those or you can leave them.

30:49.340 --> 30:52.485
But what does the person tell me about this book?

30:52.505 --> 30:53.887
What's important about this book?

30:54.147 --> 30:58.233
What makes this book so important that it should be included in this lesson?

30:58.253 --> 31:01.517
Why somebody would want it?

31:01.637 --> 31:11.691
Well, my own feeling about a book seller's catalog, I had my own, you know, in ancient Greek there was a quality that you called arete.

31:11.924 --> 31:27.669
or arete, which was, it can't be translated into English, but it's, in older school books they usually translate by virtue, the virtue of a thing, what makes something, what it is.

31:27.809 --> 31:33.158
For instance, the arete of a racing horse, the speed, that's what makes a racing horse.

31:33.739 --> 31:36.483
What is the arete of a soldier?

31:36.523 --> 31:37.645
The courage.

31:38.671 --> 31:40.854
What is the arete of a booksellers catalogue?

31:41.155 --> 31:48.466
And my answer is, a booksellers catalogue arete is the ability to sell books.

31:49.328 --> 31:54.236
So don't say more than you have to, don't say less, say just what you need to sell the book.

31:54.977 --> 31:59.444
Don't show off your knowledge, because you're just refuddling the issue.

32:00.646 --> 32:05.353
And so what I try to do, and it doesn't come easy, I used to say too much at the beginning,

32:05.502 --> 32:10.768
Now, I just try to trim it down to the essentials.

32:11.209 --> 32:12.170
What is this book about?

32:12.210 --> 32:14.172
What is the point that we sell it?

32:14.373 --> 32:17.496
Well, that justifies the price, too.

32:17.517 --> 32:18.478
Yes, of course.

32:19.259 --> 32:20.420
So that's part of the area?

32:20.440 --> 32:21.141
Yeah, yeah, yes.

32:21.321 --> 32:22.763
And how would you spell it?

32:22.783 --> 32:23.504
What would it be in English?

32:23.664 --> 32:24.925
A-R-E-T-E.

32:24.945 --> 32:25.867
Oh, so I know that word.

32:25.887 --> 32:27.328
Yeah.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.330
A-R-E-T-E.

32:28.350 --> 32:34.497
The last E is an eta, so it's a long E. Thank you.

32:35.084 --> 32:53.746
Anyway, that's my feeling about, so there are certain catalogues, without mentioning names, I see pages and pages of nonsense.

32:54.227 --> 33:00.635
They don't do anything, it's because the book is bad, they don't know what to say about it, so they're trying to make it, to fluff it up.

33:00.735 --> 33:04.399
But if you read between the lines, you'll realize,

33:04.565 --> 33:08.931
How many catalogues have you done?

33:09.411 --> 33:18.643
Well, starting with number 7, which was my first important one, I just finished my 33rd, so from 7 to 33.

33:20.005 --> 33:24.711
Would you say that you sell primarily as an institution?

33:24.731 --> 33:32.361
Yes, my big customer, or rather my major customers are institutions, some private collectors, other dealers of course,

33:32.645 --> 33:36.090
but mostly institutional collectors.

33:36.130 --> 33:42.478
Do you work with librarians in terms of collection development?

33:42.699 --> 33:44.481
Do you talk informally on the phone?

33:44.681 --> 33:44.922
Yes.

33:46.143 --> 33:54.354
I realize it's kind of selling, but also explaining to them why a certain item... I personally am not too good at phone skills.

33:55.095 --> 33:56.277
I try to avoid it.

33:56.297 --> 34:01.504
I'm not good at selling face-to-face.

34:01.973 --> 34:09.746
I like to describe it in my catalogue and let people decide for themselves.

34:09.806 --> 34:11.429
I'm not good at selling.

34:12.230 --> 34:15.836
It's a big problem.

34:15.856 --> 34:23.469
It's a skill that I lack, I envy it, but I can't do it because I get too self-conscious.

34:23.489 --> 34:28.217
I'm able to sell other people's stuff, you know, but if it's my own, I just can't do it.

34:30.391 --> 34:32.658
But that's a personal thing.

34:32.718 --> 34:43.472
Go back to your home.

34:44.566 --> 34:47.709
Would you say you have a passion for books?

34:47.749 --> 34:49.111
Where does that come from?

34:49.131 --> 34:51.413
Is that something that's inherited from your family?

34:51.453 --> 34:51.793
No.

34:52.114 --> 34:54.856
You will find out in my biological sketch.

34:55.397 --> 34:58.380
I speak a lot about it.

34:58.760 --> 35:10.152
The talk I gave at the Philo Bigelon Club, which is this one, except in this one I've added a few personal things, I called My Life with Books, How One Thing Leads to Another.

35:11.633 --> 35:21.362
But as I said, I added a few, I filled in a few gaps because they could have been too personal for all deliveries.

35:21.422 --> 35:26.607
So I've included them for your sake so that you know where I come from.

35:30.130 --> 35:36.195
But the decision to leave teaching, was it a decision to leave teaching and become a bookseller?

35:36.215 --> 35:36.756
Yeah.

35:37.096 --> 35:39.718
Or was it a decision to leave teaching and to do something for yourself?

35:39.758 --> 35:40.459
No, be a bookseller.

35:41.435 --> 35:53.200
I was collecting Aristophanies in a very big way, and the one book I didn't have and I lost it afterwards, the first edition, which is the oldie in 1498.

35:53.433 --> 35:55.316
You lost that?

35:55.336 --> 35:57.380
No, I couldn't afford it.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.004
I was teaching, you know, so how could I buy something?

36:01.387 --> 36:06.516
It was offered to me, I was still teaching at $3,500.

36:06.536 --> 36:10.363
I mean, this is a tremendous fortune for someone teaching, you know.

36:10.403 --> 36:11.505
A lot of money to earn.

36:11.905 --> 36:14.530
Yeah, but I wanted it so badly.

36:14.570 --> 36:18.597
Only a collector can understand how much I wanted it.

36:18.728 --> 36:23.274
And I didn't have the money, so what I decided to do is sell some of my own duplicates.

36:24.576 --> 36:28.021
And I raised the money somehow.

36:28.041 --> 36:32.347
But the selling process introduced me to the world of bookselling, to other booksellers.

36:32.828 --> 36:33.609
I made friends.

36:35.071 --> 36:36.032
And I liked what I saw.

36:36.072 --> 36:46.727
I found it more thrilling to be with booksellers and antiquarian books than I did with my colleagues at Herbert Lehman College.

36:47.399 --> 36:49.822
Also, certain things happened at the college.

36:52.546 --> 36:56.952
We were doing very badly in the department as far as enrollment was concerned.

36:57.954 --> 37:03.721
So, the classics department was threatened with having to teach immediate English.

37:05.804 --> 37:15.718
At the idea of having to teach immediate English, which is not what I wanted to do when I got my PhD at Harvard in classical theology, I sort of began to feel

37:16.981 --> 37:35.158
there were several factors you see there was that the idea that i wasn't totally happy after college just some of the students i mean i had some very good students that could have been at Harvard but the majority of them were not that good and i didn't feel challenged i felt

37:36.674 --> 37:41.478
I have to water down my lectures to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

37:41.518 --> 37:42.339
I don't want to do that.

37:42.419 --> 37:44.001
It's not fair to the best students.

37:45.302 --> 37:48.024
I became disenchanted with the academic world.

37:48.425 --> 37:59.035
When I published things, my colleagues were... I mean, you hardly ever read what your colleagues write.

37:59.155 --> 38:00.436
You just ask, how long is it?

38:02.698 --> 38:06.141
When I publish a catalog, I know people read it.

38:06.374 --> 38:17.654
And in fact, when I published this catalog, I remember a very famous professor of classics, who wouldn't have given me the time of day, wrote me a very nice letter about my description of some Greek books.

38:17.674 --> 38:18.315
Oh, isn't that nice?

38:18.555 --> 38:19.998
I mean, he was very famous.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.761
Bernard Knox or somebody else?

38:21.781 --> 38:22.161
Exactly.

38:22.201 --> 38:23.023
How do you know that?

38:23.383 --> 38:24.566
It was Bernard Knox.

38:24.866 --> 38:27.771
I wrote him, you know, when I was writing A Gentle Madness.

38:27.991 --> 38:28.332
Yeah.

38:28.683 --> 38:29.865
and he wrote me a beautiful letter.

38:29.885 --> 38:32.930
It's amazing that you should mention it.

38:32.950 --> 38:34.193
It was exactly who it was.

38:34.273 --> 38:36.156
I just respect his translation.

38:36.176 --> 38:40.363
I mean, I read Greek plays with great pleasure.

38:40.464 --> 38:41.906
Actually, I'll go ahead now.

38:42.066 --> 38:43.589
I've taken a seminar with him at Harvard.

38:43.609 --> 38:46.995
He had been visiting, taking a seminar on a play of Euripides.

38:47.414 --> 38:48.035
And that was it.

38:48.415 --> 38:50.097
I mean, he didn't remember me or anything.

38:50.257 --> 39:00.910
But then I put out this catalogue and I sent a copy to the academy in Washington, the, what is it called?

39:00.930 --> 39:08.880
I forget, you know, the... No, no, he was the head of, you know, in Washington.

39:08.900 --> 39:13.305
I, for some reason, not being a classicist anymore, I've forgotten all the things.

39:13.325 --> 39:15.548
Anyway, he wrote me a very nice note about

39:16.237 --> 39:20.381
some description I made of a Greek book.

39:20.421 --> 39:25.446
I know that if I had written an article, he wouldn't have seen it, he wouldn't have cared.

39:25.586 --> 39:32.873
I thought it was very ironic that not being a scholar anymore, I was getting responses from scholars.

39:33.114 --> 39:42.743
Would you say, in a satisfying sort of way, there is pride of authorship then?

39:43.043 --> 39:45.906
Yes, absolutely.

39:46.038 --> 39:47.661
I spent a long time researching.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.848
You worry about the writing, the syntax?

39:51.868 --> 39:53.952
Yeah, my writing is very stiff.

39:55.434 --> 40:05.672
What I worry most about is, and I hope this doesn't sound self-serving, I don't mean it that way, I want to be able to tell the truth about a book.

40:06.333 --> 40:10.240
And you'll be surprised how many people don't say anything to sell a book.

40:10.675 --> 40:16.483
And I want to tell the truth about the book, not distorting a fact, not exaggerating something, but still make it very appealing.

40:17.565 --> 40:19.147
And that I find very challenging.

40:19.648 --> 40:23.293
Any other wonderful anecdotes?

40:23.333 --> 40:27.259
You mentioned how the research is brought into play in the very first catalog.

40:27.319 --> 40:28.060
That's a wonderful story.

40:28.080 --> 40:36.632
Well, I tell a very good anecdote in my autobiographical sketch about the dealer who really taught me a big lesson.

40:37.658 --> 40:38.579
Emil Offenbacher.

40:38.719 --> 40:39.941
But you'll read the anecdote.

40:39.961 --> 40:40.742
It's a very good one.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.284
Is he one of the other great books?

40:42.324 --> 40:42.665
Yes.

40:44.347 --> 40:49.534
I was looking for, when he died in 1990, there was a service for him at the Grollet Club.

40:49.574 --> 40:52.538
I mean, not by the Grollet Club, but it took place at the Grollet Club.

40:52.558 --> 40:53.639
And I was one of the speakers.

40:54.841 --> 40:58.466
And I wrote, I retold an anecdote that he had told me.

40:58.766 --> 41:00.989
And I was looking for it, and I can't find it anymore.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.833
Is this Stefan Pryor, do you think, at the Grollet Club?

41:03.853 --> 41:05.515
I don't, it has nothing to do with the Grollet Club.

41:05.595 --> 41:06.957
But his wife, his widow,

41:07.240 --> 41:08.601
It's someone you should speak to.

41:08.822 --> 41:10.083
She's around, huh?

41:10.103 --> 41:11.445
Yeah.

41:11.465 --> 41:14.828
How would I find out about him, his biography and stuff like that?

41:15.109 --> 41:19.433
But she will have the sketch, because you wrote a biographical sketch.

41:19.633 --> 41:20.935
She's here in New York someplace?

41:20.955 --> 41:22.777
She's in Queens, if she's still there.

41:22.797 --> 41:26.020
Unless she moved to her home in... It's O-F-F-E-N?

41:26.401 --> 41:29.885
O-F-F-E-N-B-A-C-H-E-R.

41:29.905 --> 41:30.806
That's what I have.

41:31.566 --> 41:36.051
And if you want to know her address, you can call Jonathan Hill.

41:36.131 --> 41:36.792
Do you know the name?

41:37.058 --> 41:39.021
Oh, I'll find out for you.

41:39.602 --> 41:39.962
Who is it?

41:40.283 --> 41:41.565
He's a dealer, a colleague of mine.

41:42.086 --> 41:43.428
But I can find out for you.

41:44.009 --> 41:48.496
What was his significance, would you say, just to go off on a tangent?

41:48.736 --> 42:00.013
Well, he... You see, I'm still... I was going to say... No, I was going to say he majored in... He specialized in... You see, all that... Still in college.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.998
He specialized in history of science.

42:03.130 --> 42:07.438
He had been a bookseller in Paris in the 30s.

42:08.019 --> 42:08.960
He was an emigre.

42:09.561 --> 42:16.113
But the story about him, which I found absolutely fascinating, the one that he told, I'll make it very brief.

42:16.133 --> 42:24.548
When he came to America, he didn't have a job, so he worked in a factory.

42:25.270 --> 42:30.016
And all he had to do all day was to watch a certain machine going up and down and make sure that it didn't stop.

42:30.477 --> 42:33.060
I mean, for a guy with his intelligence, you know.

42:34.361 --> 42:34.842
How's it you?

42:35.643 --> 42:36.124
Are you sure?

42:36.244 --> 42:36.664
Yes, sir.

42:36.845 --> 42:37.666
Okay, please.

42:38.026 --> 42:38.727
This is unusual.

42:41.270 --> 42:45.115
I always pay for people here, so you're probably very sure.

42:45.135 --> 42:45.736
Certainly, yeah.

42:45.756 --> 42:46.056
Thank you.

42:48.219 --> 42:48.780
You just talk.

42:48.840 --> 42:51.163
I'm just trying to find a way to get a card.

42:51.363 --> 42:51.463
Okay.

42:52.186 --> 42:56.790
I like to put all these in America.

42:56.850 --> 43:01.815
Anyway, so he was... All he had to do in his factory was to watch this machine another stop.

43:01.895 --> 43:02.195
Yeah.

43:04.137 --> 43:06.059
He was not a tremendously educated person.

43:06.079 --> 43:07.160
He was very well-read.

43:07.800 --> 43:11.824
He knew... I mean, he was a... He knew music.

43:11.864 --> 43:12.945
He knew science.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.006
He knew literature.

43:14.026 --> 43:17.650
One of those really civilized people.

43:18.050 --> 43:20.252
And here's this man with this brain.

43:20.587 --> 43:23.470
who has to watch the machine all day to make sure it doesn't stop.

43:24.811 --> 43:25.552
One day it stopped.

43:26.093 --> 43:27.094
He was panicked.

43:27.114 --> 43:30.497
He felt totally inadequate.

43:30.517 --> 43:45.413
So he goes to his foreman, and this is the story I told of his, to the foreman, and the foreman comes over, takes this pipe out of his mouth, knocks on the machine at a certain point, and the thing starts going again.

43:46.793 --> 43:50.759
And Emil felt so inadequate, this man just made him look like a fool.

43:50.799 --> 43:55.086
He was panicked and this guy just knew where to knock with his pipe.

43:57.530 --> 43:59.734
So he felt absolutely stupid.

43:59.754 --> 44:03.199
He came home, he was depressed and not even good at this.

44:04.161 --> 44:13.155
And then he got a catalog from Swan Gallery one day, this was in the early 40s, and he saw a book in it.

44:13.490 --> 44:41.758
and uh it would it was an incurable with a woodcut described as a lady with a big dog and he knew from his knowledge in books that this wasn't a lady with a dog it was saint jerome and the lion and that the woodcut was by durer and he decided you know go to the auction and buy it you know put lady with a big yeah you know so he bought the book and he couldn't believe it he got it for next to nothing and he felt that

44:42.565 --> 45:03.308
this is great you know and he felt when he bought that book and recognized something that nobody else had seen that he had taken his pipe and knocked on this machine that's how he put it that he was able to be like his foreman in his own field that he was master of the field and i find that so um

45:03.558 --> 45:05.801
Inspiring, you know?

45:05.862 --> 45:06.923
So that's the story I told.

45:06.943 --> 45:10.429
But it's in his... Can we do just a little more coffee?

45:10.449 --> 45:12.572
Actually, Mr. I could probably have to go back pretty soon.

45:12.592 --> 45:15.576
Did you get down on the recorder with more coffee for you, too, as well, sir?

45:17.119 --> 45:23.068
Are you going to have some more coffee?

45:23.188 --> 45:23.829
No.

45:24.250 --> 45:24.710
Okay.

45:24.811 --> 45:29.558
So his widow has this autobiographical sketch with that anecdote told in it.

45:30.599 --> 45:32.282
And you think she's in Queens.

45:32.583 --> 45:36.406
Well, he used to live in Queens.

45:37.387 --> 45:40.270
I don't know if she still lives there, but I can find out.

45:40.991 --> 45:47.116
In fact, I would love to be here.

45:47.236 --> 45:49.458
He was someone I admire tremendously.

45:49.498 --> 45:57.205
In fact, when I was toying about going into the business, I went to see him in Queens.

45:58.867 --> 46:02.370
He had ordered a book for me when I was putting out those catalogs.

46:03.127 --> 46:08.392
And I went out there just to meet him and find out if I should go into the business.

46:08.672 --> 46:10.714
And he told me something.

46:11.295 --> 46:15.759
The reason why he was buying the book that I sold him, which taught me the lesson of my life in the book business.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.181
But you'll read about it.

46:18.282 --> 46:25.449
I think that after I transcribe this, and I read your sketch, then I'll get in touch again.

46:27.731 --> 46:31.334
You've got a lot of wonderful things to tell me about that.

46:31.435 --> 46:31.935
Oh, yeah?

46:32.337 --> 46:44.693
I like the idea that you bring this weight

46:45.196 --> 46:46.938
What's the phrase that they use now?

46:47.058 --> 46:49.201
I can't even think of it.

46:49.221 --> 46:50.042
Say it in French.

46:52.125 --> 46:52.946
I can't even think of it.

46:53.266 --> 46:54.888
Can we play again?

46:54.908 --> 46:57.832
Did you tell me why you chose the classics?

46:57.852 --> 46:59.994
Ah, you will find out in my life.

47:00.014 --> 47:02.077
Everything, as I said, one thing meets to another.

47:02.317 --> 47:05.742
And do you come from a family of scholars?

47:06.342 --> 47:07.464
Go find out where I come from.

47:07.484 --> 47:09.606
That's all of it.

47:09.686 --> 47:10.868
No, not at all.

47:10.988 --> 47:13.651
So you came here as a poor kid before a new life?

47:13.752 --> 47:13.932
Yes.

47:13.952 --> 47:14.933
I have no education.

47:15.537 --> 47:30.133
I didn't speak English, I didn't have a trade, and I had to find I was placed by some organization for, I think, Jewish immigrants.

47:30.153 --> 47:42.287
I believe it, I'm not going to revisit the Haven or Moore story, but one of the reasons you were alert to his claims, you said to me, was because of it.

47:42.470 --> 47:45.837
how hard education came to, how much you revered it.

47:46.318 --> 47:47.982
I wonder if you could just kind of repeat that.

47:48.002 --> 47:52.231
Well, when he said to me, when he saw, see, he wanted to see my house, the attic.

47:52.271 --> 47:56.580
I'm just going to put this on the other side so it doesn't run out, because we're about to.
