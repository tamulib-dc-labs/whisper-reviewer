00:03.085 --> 00:32.670
So, in regard to identifying the drawings for the windows, on one visit to London, I was talking to John Dreyfus in his office at the Monotype Corporation, and he

00:33.292 --> 00:40.140
said something like, of course you've been in contact with Souter, haven't you?

00:40.160 --> 00:42.302
And I asked, who is Souter?

00:43.323 --> 00:45.285
And he nearly fell off the chair.

00:46.326 --> 00:57.038
He explained that Yale University Press was going to publish Souter's two-volume work

00:57.524 --> 01:01.830
on the stained glass of William Morris and his circle.

01:03.132 --> 01:11.905
A professor of art history at the University of Manchester in England.

01:11.985 --> 01:23.481
A twenty-year on-and-off project of his, trying to do the definitive record of all the stained glass work of Morris and Company.

01:25.638 --> 01:30.928
And John Dreyfus already knew of all this material that I had.

01:32.330 --> 01:41.347
So I immediately wrote to Souter, and he responded, please send anything.

01:42.449 --> 01:49.722
And I sent two cardboard cartons of Xeroxes of all 700 drawings.

01:51.575 --> 01:54.599
All 140 of the drapery studies.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.842
Did you do all the Xeroxes yourself?

02:00.647 --> 02:00.748
Yeah.

02:00.768 --> 02:00.828
Oh.

02:00.848 --> 02:04.413
Because he wouldn't trust anybody else.

02:05.033 --> 02:07.096
I just had to take it for the tape.

02:08.238 --> 02:15.147
Xeroxes of these two handwritten catalogs, Morris and Company No.

02:15.167 --> 02:19.253
1, catalog of designs used for windows.

02:19.570 --> 02:36.736
executed from June 1876 to June 30, 1916, and then from June 1, 1916, and it ends in 1940 when they closed.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.660
But they kept opening in just two journals.

02:40.101 --> 02:40.321
Yes.

02:42.164 --> 02:44.768
And then in 19...

02:49.912 --> 02:52.675
I think it's archival material, isn't it?

02:52.715 --> 02:53.737
Yes, yes, yes.

02:54.417 --> 02:59.043
It's major.

02:59.063 --> 03:13.580
And here it tells when Duncan Durrell wishes to inform past patrons and messers Morris & Company, Art Workers Limited, now in process of voluntary liquidations and previously trading at 17 St.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.362
George Street, Hannibal Square, London,

03:15.697 --> 03:34.480
that he has purchased the stained glass department of the company, together with the sole rights of reproduction of all cartoons designed by the founder of the business, William Morris, currently the poet and artist, Sir Edward Byrne Jones and H. Durrell, E-E-A-R-E.

03:34.500 --> 03:43.932
With his steadfast intention to maintain the high traditions associated with Morris, stained glass, and he hopes to be favored, S-A-D-O-U-R-E-B, your continued patronage

03:44.452 --> 03:57.630
I wish it to assure you of the same regard for your future requirements as it has been his privilege to bestow upon your inquiries of the need in orders received during many past years, Second World War, 1939 to 1945."

03:57.750 --> 04:00.213
See, no work done then.

04:00.273 --> 04:13.952
But then, starting in 1945, or 1946, until 1965, last work by Duncan Darrell.

04:14.185 --> 04:22.477
I've never read other than in Suter's book from this source that the company went on.

04:22.557 --> 04:36.997
So let's say, let's point out that using these books, which Suter obtained from you, he was actually able to determine the very important scholarly information and the preparation of these books.

04:37.417 --> 04:40.041
That is part of the significance, I think, of what you should show us.

04:40.983 --> 04:46.350
a whole bunch of information that Suter was totally unaware of him on Windows.

04:46.471 --> 04:59.949
And as Suter says in his introduction here someplace—yeah.

04:59.969 --> 05:10.804
Oh, first I have to say, when Suter got all this stuff, and then I shortly after went to visit Suter at his place there,

05:10.868 --> 05:18.075
It was one of those mixed blessings, where here he had galley proofs.

05:18.095 --> 05:20.938
His book was finished.

05:20.958 --> 05:36.893
So, as he says here, in the last stages of February, after the text of Israel was already in the podium, I have received a great deal of most valuable, most generally spent photographs of his unrighteous collection of original documents, drawings, sketchbook writing.

05:37.852 --> 05:38.593
Let me write down.

05:38.633 --> 05:41.557
I'm going to have to pull that out of a copy of that.

05:41.577 --> 05:43.899
But he's telling you that he had to revise the book.

05:43.919 --> 05:47.624
Oh, then, to show how the problem he had.

05:50.147 --> 05:51.709
Horrible.

05:51.729 --> 05:57.696
But can you imagine the scholarly disaster if it hadn't been included?

05:57.736 --> 06:00.820
How in your own mind did he make so many mistakes?

06:01.721 --> 06:04.905
Oh, he looked for more material.

06:05.172 --> 06:08.477
He actually went to the widow's house.

06:08.497 --> 06:11.442
All this stuff was up in the attic.

06:11.462 --> 06:19.274
But in their conversation, I don't know what she was like or what he said, she didn't say she had any of this stuff there.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.678
He was that close to it.

06:21.698 --> 06:24.062
He was downstairs and this was up there.

06:25.144 --> 06:29.791
Now, what's intrigued... He must have been thrilled that he heard about you both.

06:29.972 --> 06:30.893
Finally, yeah.

06:31.598 --> 06:44.390
Because, just to give you an idea of the amount of work he had to do, you just try opening any page, and you'll find a reference like this.

06:45.571 --> 06:50.675
The sketch design for the Annunciation 29, it belongs to Mr. S.L.

06:50.735 --> 06:51.076
Berger.

06:51.656 --> 06:57.621
He used one line, sooner used one line for each drawing in the index of owners of cartoons and drawings.

06:59.904 --> 07:00.424
And...

07:02.969 --> 07:04.911
Oh, my God.

07:05.632 --> 07:12.741
All he could do, in order not to add too many pages, he just went back and forth.

07:12.781 --> 07:13.021
S.L.

07:13.061 --> 07:23.554
Berger, let's let the record show, is about two full columns of this large coffee table-sized book.

07:23.574 --> 07:25.697
How many would you say there are there?

07:25.797 --> 07:26.558
Are there 140?

07:26.578 --> 07:28.140
Or is it more than that?

07:31.283 --> 07:32.605
No, it's got to be more...

07:33.412 --> 07:35.134
Wait a minute.

07:35.194 --> 07:36.776
No, no, you're more than two full columns.

07:36.796 --> 07:38.238
You're close to three full columns.

07:38.439 --> 07:40.181
Right, closer to three full columns.

07:40.201 --> 07:42.504
Because I thought it ended up there.

07:42.524 --> 07:43.045
No, no, it ends over here.

07:43.065 --> 07:44.086
It's three full columns.

07:45.768 --> 07:46.068
Yeah.

07:46.089 --> 07:49.393
Several hundred.

07:49.413 --> 07:53.098
How do you feel when you see that?

07:53.118 --> 07:54.279
You must feel pretty good, though.

07:54.499 --> 07:55.140
Oh, sure.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.584
Is this what it's all about?

07:58.064 --> 08:03.351
Is this a secondary thing for you, or is this a primary thing of building such a collection?

08:04.124 --> 08:17.563
Well, it's tremendous to realize that this is, in fact, a definitive piece of work that probably cannot be improved on.

08:17.583 --> 08:21.289
And it was impossible to produce without reference... Without all of this material.

08:21.309 --> 08:22.250
...to our collection.

08:22.270 --> 08:24.033
Yeah.

08:24.053 --> 08:26.737
The incorporation of all of this information.

08:26.757 --> 08:33.186
See, because what he got from the...

08:33.976 --> 08:36.478
Look how detailed those things.

08:36.498 --> 08:36.939
Oh, yeah.

08:37.639 --> 08:46.647
See, in these little diamond-shaped things, there's a series of examples when you view the drawings.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.550
And what we're looking at are—these are scale drawings.

08:50.150 --> 08:51.111
They're more than drawings.

08:51.171 --> 09:01.941
They're actually— These are referred to as sketch designs, and they are prepared to get approval before going

09:02.410 --> 09:05.575
to the full-size state of stained-glass windows.

09:05.675 --> 09:06.916
Stained-glass windows.

09:06.936 --> 09:15.348
In other words, you, the church committee, come in, or, okay, let's... I'm just looking at one in Bloomsbury, by the way, 26 Queens Square, Bloomsbury.

09:19.675 --> 09:23.780
Here's one for a church in East Windsor, September 14th, 1869.

09:24.181 --> 09:26.324
So they would make the stained-glass windows for the churches.

09:26.645 --> 09:27.386
Oh, sure.

09:27.406 --> 09:28.367
They would make fractions.

09:29.377 --> 09:31.840
Is he a businessman, entrepreneur, artist?

09:31.860 --> 09:33.823
He made money out of everything.

09:33.963 --> 09:36.126
I mean, was this the goal for him, do you think?

09:36.206 --> 09:36.466
No.

09:36.506 --> 09:37.968
He was a creative genius.

09:38.850 --> 09:49.844
He had managers who used to, Morris would drive him crazy because he would be doing so many things instead of finishing up this thing on schedule and this thing.

09:51.526 --> 09:53.709
How, if you were asked to describe him, what is he?

09:53.729 --> 09:54.631
What is William Morris?

09:55.892 --> 09:56.633
What was he?

09:56.793 --> 09:57.274
What was he?

09:58.553 --> 09:59.714
What are these now?

09:59.754 --> 10:04.860
These are photographs of the full-size cartoons.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.142
So now you, the church committee, have come in.

10:08.023 --> 10:09.284
We go through this.

10:10.025 --> 10:17.032
First of all, you tell me you've got— Oh, this is just close to where I take some notes.

10:17.112 --> 10:20.896
This is an old version of a loose-leaf notebook.

10:20.916 --> 10:21.597
Yeah.

10:21.697 --> 10:26.502
I refer to it as a photographic file of the—

10:27.443 --> 10:32.789
existing of the already-designed cartoons.

10:32.889 --> 10:39.396
They're photographs of cartoons, of designs that have been used.

10:39.416 --> 10:48.246
Now, you come in and say you've got a three-light window.

10:50.048 --> 10:52.751
These are referred to as lights.

10:52.771 --> 10:54.413
And so we'll go through this.

10:56.215 --> 11:07.626
and pick out, well, maybe if we use that figure, and that figure, and that figure, and you say, yeah, that sounds right, because we're Saint Somebody, and that should fit in to something.

11:08.307 --> 11:16.775
And they would prepare this, incorporating those designs for you to agree on, and give you an idea of the color.

11:17.095 --> 11:17.696
You know what?

11:17.736 --> 11:23.461
It's almost like customizing out of a preset cast, in a way.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.282
Is that right?

11:24.481 --> 11:29.408
They're going to take a suit off the shelf, and the guy's going to bring it in a little bit, but... Exactly.

11:29.448 --> 11:34.695
Except they would photographically enlarge and diminish to fit your window.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.621
So they work with the architect, obviously, too.

11:38.981 --> 11:40.123
Sure.

11:40.223 --> 11:42.246
Now, you see this figure here?

11:42.266 --> 11:43.347
Yeah.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.509
There it is there.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.071
And you see this one here?

11:46.091 --> 11:46.952
There it is there.

11:47.573 --> 11:48.835
But here it was done

11:49.625 --> 11:54.653
many years before, like 22 years earlier, was when it was first designed.

11:55.535 --> 12:00.824
But they decided they'd like that same subject.

12:00.844 --> 12:04.831
So they would change the colors to suit the color groupings.

12:07.595 --> 12:09.959
So this you might say is a sample.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.223
So they would have to work with both of these books.

12:12.929 --> 12:13.250
No.

12:13.430 --> 12:17.156
No, they would work with this book, and they would prepare this drawing before you.

12:17.536 --> 12:17.877
I get it.

12:19.299 --> 12:22.023
You being the committee from Ravendale Church.

12:23.265 --> 12:26.210
Okay, which is what we're looking at, Ravendale's church.

12:26.230 --> 12:27.492
1877.

12:27.712 --> 12:27.973
Right.

12:28.033 --> 12:36.066
So you decided, neat, except I don't like all these diamonds, let's put in something.

12:36.206 --> 12:36.987
That's what they did.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.389
So you can see they did.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.731
They did, they changed it a little bit.

12:40.032 --> 12:40.152
Right.

12:43.608 --> 12:51.299
So this is kind of like what your salesman would take.

12:52.020 --> 12:59.591
I hate to use that, but your representatives would take and would sit down with these books and would custom design you a window.

13:02.135 --> 13:05.800
Now here's what's important.

13:05.820 --> 13:09.105
You might say, oh, well, I want a first edition.

13:10.407 --> 13:11.168
Well, okay.

13:11.637 --> 13:14.480
If you want, we'll design a new design for you.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.023
That's going to cost so much more and take longer.

13:18.244 --> 13:33.201
But to make you feel better, Morris would say, every window is a first edition, because in every case, we go back to the original cartoon.

13:33.221 --> 13:33.761
That's true.

13:34.682 --> 13:40.969
The first execution of it was from the cartoon, and the fifth time you use it, you go back to the cartoon.

13:42.198 --> 13:44.962
The work is exquisite.

13:45.062 --> 13:53.794
Is this watercolor, by the way?

13:53.814 --> 13:57.078
Yeah, these are all watercolor.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.249
And look at putting in the pattern on every one of these diamonds.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.273
They didn't just... These were skilled artists.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.139
Do we know who any of these artists are?

14:10.239 --> 14:10.800
Are they signed?

14:11.200 --> 14:14.144
No, they're not signed, but I can sort of recognize.

14:14.344 --> 14:16.447
This is Ford and Alex Brown.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.589
I've gotten to know some of their styles.

14:21.273 --> 14:23.756
This is Bryn Jones.

14:23.776 --> 14:25.338
They didn't finish a new idea.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.559
You've got the idea.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.440
You've got the idea.

14:27.521 --> 14:29.663
Take it back to your parish.

14:30.324 --> 14:36.792
Do you think it's done like this today?

14:38.088 --> 14:40.851
First of all, there aren't that many windows being made.

14:40.871 --> 14:42.693
I was going to say, but that's not done.

14:46.277 --> 14:46.717
Wow.

14:46.898 --> 14:48.780
And this all came from the archives?

14:49.601 --> 14:50.381
Yes.

14:50.401 --> 14:52.924
Did you have any idea what you were getting when you bought the archives?

14:52.944 --> 14:56.288
Just from a typewritten list, but I haven't seen it.

14:56.869 --> 15:00.292
Yeah, but you were figuring it's got to be great stuff.

15:00.392 --> 15:03.556
Did you think, well, there must be a lot of junk in there, but so what?

15:03.576 --> 15:04.737
No.

15:04.757 --> 15:06.199
Everything was important.

15:06.219 --> 15:07.420
Everything's good.

15:07.737 --> 15:09.139
Right.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.002
No, they didn't know how to do so.

15:12.022 --> 15:13.784
He said they didn't know how to do so.

15:13.804 --> 15:20.412
Yeah, but a lot of it must have been bills of lading or receipts from the, uh... Well, I wish they had happened.

15:20.432 --> 15:23.576
But the Victoria and Albert already has loads of that.

15:23.596 --> 15:23.956
Well, what?

15:24.056 --> 15:25.538
They have that and they don't have this.

15:25.618 --> 15:26.659
I mean, how do you figure that?

15:27.060 --> 15:35.550
Well, when the company closed, I figured, first of all, they had a sale of a lot of documents, and a lot of people bought

15:37.049 --> 15:45.299
maybe not so much documents, but they bought big pieces of fabric, big whatever was sort of there in stock.

15:46.781 --> 15:53.689
And a lot of those have ended up after Victoria and Albert and other places.

15:53.709 --> 16:06.465
And the cartoons have been sold over a long period of time.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.486
No.

16:10.029 --> 16:14.195
This is a record of the sale of all the cartoons.

16:14.215 --> 16:16.579
Mr. Holliday bought a hell of a lot of them.

16:16.599 --> 16:22.528
Are you collecting William Morris as an individual, or William Morris as an industry that he created?

16:22.568 --> 16:23.669
All of the above.

16:24.390 --> 16:25.692
Anything to do.

16:25.712 --> 16:29.678
But they are all equally important to him.

16:29.758 --> 16:32.643
It is, because the whole thing is the creation of William Morris.

16:32.663 --> 16:33.264
Is this correct?

16:33.484 --> 16:34.225
Yeah.

16:34.245 --> 16:35.507
Or if he didn't do it,

16:36.027 --> 16:43.316
Personally, he's the driving force about something that's better than others.

16:43.336 --> 16:48.383
The original drawing, when he was designing the Troy-type, is a pretty special piece.

16:48.643 --> 16:50.385
This is our telelector says?

16:50.405 --> 17:01.058
This is Morris designing an alphabet for the Comscott Press, namely the Troy-type.

17:01.078 --> 17:01.619
C-R-O-Y.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.942
C-R-O-Y, because it was meant

17:04.580 --> 17:07.784
This is in Morris's hand?

17:08.004 --> 17:10.227
Yes.

17:10.587 --> 17:13.912
It was meant for the histories.

17:14.372 --> 17:16.375
Is that better there?

17:16.935 --> 17:25.005
It wasn't bad actually.

17:27.348 --> 17:28.630
Sandy, will you say...

17:28.762 --> 17:34.688
are some things better than others as far as collecting.

17:36.290 --> 17:41.355
A drawing of Morris designing the type is about as good as it can be.

17:43.157 --> 17:48.923
But things like this, the layout of a page from the Kelmscott Press, is pretty great.

17:50.485 --> 17:52.007
This did not come with the archives?

17:52.027 --> 17:53.008
No.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.689
There was no Kelmscott Press.

17:54.709 --> 17:57.132
There were some Kelmscott Press books.

17:57.466 --> 18:00.531
in the archives, but there was no Count Scott Press ephemeral.

18:02.073 --> 18:07.761
Or this, the first impression of engravings for the first page of Chaucer.

18:08.943 --> 18:13.850
Some slight alterations were made before printing, signed by W.H.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.653
Hooper, who did the engraving.

18:15.973 --> 18:21.462
And then... This is a proof page?

18:21.542 --> 18:23.004
That's a proof.

18:23.024 --> 18:25.768
See, then here's a proof of the text

18:26.204 --> 18:27.827
to fit in that page.

18:28.828 --> 18:30.131
And they were exploring.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.114
And here you see there are five lines.

18:33.136 --> 18:35.500
This couple is split here.

18:36.341 --> 18:38.044
Here's a photo.

18:38.485 --> 18:44.174
Now, would this represent several passes to the press to get that in there?

18:44.194 --> 18:45.557
How would they find it?

18:45.577 --> 18:46.899
Yeah.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.101
How would they maybe not?

18:48.742 --> 18:49.684
Can't be sure.

18:51.286 --> 18:52.228
You see, the fact

18:57.355 --> 19:26.198
The fact that they did the actual printing from electro types, which are zinc blocks made from the wood blocks, so that this big, a wood block, being printed 425 paper copies and 13 vellum copies, plus all the mistake copies, the block probably wouldn't survive.

19:28.473 --> 19:45.012
And Morris had to be convinced that he couldn't tell the difference between printing from the wood block or printing from the zinc block.

19:45.032 --> 19:53.482
And they were able to prove it to him by doing the same example of each, and he agreed.

19:53.502 --> 19:58.227
So that's why this whole thing was likely a zinc block.

19:59.033 --> 20:02.078
made from all the separate wood blocks.

20:03.360 --> 20:11.272
And this is still metal type, which would be separate, a second printing.

20:11.472 --> 20:12.113
That's my guess.

20:12.273 --> 20:14.637
It would have to be.

20:14.657 --> 20:19.124
And then they would, yeah, I hadn't stopped to wonder how that would happen.

20:19.144 --> 20:23.370
Then they would have to come back again and print the red.

20:24.110 --> 20:30.219
We're talking several passes to it, and the registration has to be absolutely precise every time through.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.646
So let's say there's one, two, three.

20:35.747 --> 20:43.659
Then on the verso, there's at least four for the type and five for the red on that side.

20:43.679 --> 20:46.523
You have five opportunities to screw up each page.

20:47.178 --> 20:50.202
Every page in the book.

20:50.482 --> 20:58.072
And if you didn't have a border, then you'd have only four chances to screw up each page.

20:58.352 --> 20:58.632
Unbelievable.

20:59.233 --> 21:00.515
There's the bunch that did it.

21:00.995 --> 21:04.339
That's the crew of the Tom Scott Press, and that's Morris' daughter.

21:04.419 --> 21:05.140
Look at Morris.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.444
He's a wonderful one.

21:08.605 --> 21:09.346
Yeah.

21:09.366 --> 21:13.110
But he looks like he's 82 there, and he died at 62.

21:13.310 --> 21:14.552
How old is he there?

21:15.089 --> 21:19.153
He's probably sixty, maybe sixty.

21:19.274 --> 21:20.555
There's one woman in the crowd.

21:20.615 --> 21:21.956
That's Mary Morris, his daughter.

21:23.338 --> 21:32.027
And how significant was she to the— Well, at the Morrison Company, she was in charge of all the embroidery departments.

21:32.047 --> 21:35.531
She designed and executed— Really?

21:35.571 --> 21:35.831
Yeah.

21:35.851 --> 21:36.012
Good.

21:36.652 --> 21:39.395
It's nice to see women were actively involved in his operation.

21:39.696 --> 21:42.919
Sure, he had lots of women working for him.

21:43.810 --> 21:49.176
Mrs. Holliday was his major embroideress.

21:49.757 --> 21:51.118
I have a lot of correspondence.

21:52.079 --> 21:54.522
Sid wanted to publish that.

21:54.743 --> 22:00.950
Yeah, it was a separate book, The Correspondence of Morris to Mrs. Holliday.

22:00.970 --> 22:13.564
And he actually did all the typescripts again, and then I don't know whether he was going to get Kim Merker to do it and to tell him.

22:15.232 --> 22:16.374
printing the Chaucer.

22:17.175 --> 22:24.144
That's a very historic moment in the history of printing, isn't it?

22:24.164 --> 22:26.327
Sure it is.

22:26.407 --> 22:27.608
Do you know who those individuals are?

22:27.648 --> 22:29.531
Probably one of them is Bowdoin.

22:31.153 --> 22:32.775
I'm not sure who's the other guy.

22:32.795 --> 22:34.237
That looks like you're pressed, doesn't it?

22:34.257 --> 22:34.518
Yeah.

22:34.678 --> 22:37.281
See, it's the same design, just very big.

22:37.682 --> 22:44.631
But here, look at this use of photography, trying a smaller size than they finally decided on.

22:45.117 --> 22:51.123
And then I have another ... See, here's where it was designed first.

22:51.143 --> 22:58.851
Morris tried setting a column for the Chaucer when he realized it was going to take about four volumes.

22:59.552 --> 23:04.877
Then he had it recast in what's referred to now as the Chaucer size.

23:04.897 --> 23:07.760
Same design, just smaller.

23:07.780 --> 23:11.524
There's no way to calculate how much work went into the creation of this one book, right?

23:11.664 --> 23:12.345
Oh, God.

23:12.365 --> 23:14.567
And we're talking about how many copies?

23:15.172 --> 23:20.179
$4.25 printed on paper and $13 printed on double.

23:20.620 --> 23:21.401
Was he doing this?

23:21.481 --> 23:23.684
And of course, what did they sell for when they were originally?

23:24.345 --> 23:25.006
Twenty pounds.

23:26.508 --> 23:28.811
Not in the pigskin, but in the ordinary buying.

23:30.233 --> 23:31.695
See, that was a lot of money.

23:32.596 --> 23:35.140
So the idea was to make some money on this.

23:35.180 --> 23:44.773
This was not— No, he started out—let's say the first intention when he said, let's see if printing can be done properly.

23:45.850 --> 23:48.554
He meant to print 20 copies to give to his friends.

23:49.956 --> 23:58.368
And word got out that Morris was getting involved in printing, and he was swamped with... So he had no problems placing these days.

23:58.388 --> 24:01.353
So the first book he printed 200 copies.

24:01.373 --> 24:01.873
It went up.

24:02.514 --> 24:08.683
And today's jargon, we might say they were probably fully subscribed prior to publication.

24:08.743 --> 24:11.988
Here, let's... Oh, is this it?

24:12.008 --> 24:13.410
Oh, okay.

24:14.369 --> 24:19.914
We are carrying here.

24:19.934 --> 24:22.997
Why don't you tell us, Sandy, what you've got here.

24:23.077 --> 24:27.040
Well, this is one of... ...feeling.

24:27.181 --> 24:27.581
Oh, God.

24:28.642 --> 24:30.664
You don't mind if I take a whiff of it?

24:32.645 --> 24:33.226
Yeah, what I like.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.088
To me, it's all the senses are pleased.

24:37.049 --> 24:44.376
This is one of 46 copies of the paper copy

24:45.014 --> 24:56.032
but with the white pigskin binding designed by Morris and executed at the Doves Binary by Douglas Cockrell.

24:56.052 --> 25:02.041
He did all forty-six of the paper copies and two of the vellums.

25:02.382 --> 25:06.388
So there are actually forty-eight white pigskin bindings.

25:06.408 --> 25:07.910
It's in exquisite condition.

25:09.393 --> 25:12.658
Silver clasps, blind stamps,

25:17.819 --> 25:19.641
You don't buy any blind stamps?

25:19.941 --> 25:21.162
That means there's no gold.

25:21.342 --> 25:22.584
There's no inlays.

25:22.864 --> 25:26.668
It's just the one piece of leather, impressed.

25:28.269 --> 25:31.913
There's no gold or red or anything.

25:31.933 --> 25:32.994
Can you fix that?

25:33.254 --> 25:33.614
No way.

25:34.235 --> 25:34.876
You wouldn't try?

25:34.976 --> 25:37.698
Nobody's ever come up with a way to do it.

25:37.718 --> 25:40.101
I don't mean to fix it, but to stop the chemical action.

25:40.141 --> 25:40.862
You couldn't treat it?

25:41.002 --> 25:44.485
I've never come across anybody's ... What's that little symbol?

25:44.505 --> 25:45.626
That's the first signature.

25:46.527 --> 25:47.488
Oh.

25:48.667 --> 25:54.195
and then it gets bound by the signature notes.

25:54.215 --> 25:55.957
Oh, God, that's gorgeous.

25:55.977 --> 25:57.840
Look at the type biting through the page.

25:57.860 --> 26:03.348
Well, you see it's all dampened paper when they print.

26:03.368 --> 26:04.549
The works of Jeffrey.

26:04.569 --> 26:05.390
Oh, my goodness.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.273
You're looking at it.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.397
Tell us what you have, what we're open to now.

26:10.598 --> 26:11.899
You tell them.

26:12.060 --> 26:12.781
What do you see?

26:12.821 --> 26:17.307
Well, I see the title page and the works of Jeffrey Chaucer.

26:17.793 --> 26:30.647
Now newly imprinted, here beginneth the tales of Canterbury, and first the prologue thereof.

26:30.667 --> 26:39.777
And I have to get a photograph of this, with Sandy opening it.

26:39.817 --> 26:42.720
F-R-O-I-S-S-A-R-T.

26:43.190 --> 27:07.054
this was something that morris was had in the planning stages he did indeed we'll begin at the prologue of sir s-y-r j-o-h-a-n frost of the chronicles of france england i-n-g-l-a-n-d-e and other places adjoining a-d-j-o-y-n-y-n-g-e the first chapters now this was

27:07.608 --> 27:10.533
Something he planned to do similar to the kind of original?

27:10.553 --> 27:19.366
There would have been a companion in size and even a further advance of enrichment.

27:19.386 --> 27:27.018
And what you have here are probably more rare than the ... Oh, right.

27:27.699 --> 27:29.141
But the book was never printed.

27:29.161 --> 27:32.907
No, but this is printed on vellum is why it looks so smart.

27:33.089 --> 27:39.619
But the thing of it is, he died before the book was printed, so these were just things that they were working on before the book was ever printed.

27:40.561 --> 27:44.647
You're looking at pages of a book that never was finished, is that right?

27:44.887 --> 27:45.068
Yes.

27:45.448 --> 27:48.513
And that's the Doheny sale that we're looking at.

27:48.533 --> 27:52.479
And what I want to do is see what a page like this is.

27:52.620 --> 27:53.982
Oh, I'd like to see that myself.

27:55.764 --> 28:01.273
Let's see if I can find this somewhere.

28:05.287 --> 28:06.408
Did you ever meet the Countess?

28:07.349 --> 28:07.629
No.

28:08.730 --> 28:14.695
No, I didn't.

28:14.715 --> 28:15.496
Come with all the other stuff.

28:15.516 --> 28:15.916
No, no.

28:16.017 --> 28:16.357
There we go.

28:16.377 --> 28:17.037
These are just pages.

28:17.058 --> 28:17.678
There it is.

28:17.698 --> 28:18.179
There it is.

28:19.360 --> 28:19.840
There it is.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.602
This is item 2346 in the Doheny.

28:22.622 --> 28:25.925
Hold this while I make that count.

28:25.945 --> 28:29.789
2346 Doheny, because I got the price for it.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.010
It only brought $3,300.

28:31.030 --> 28:34.433
I would have expected much more.

28:36.792 --> 28:37.273
Would you?

28:38.474 --> 28:39.515
For one page, though.

28:39.535 --> 28:39.955
It's not bad.

28:40.536 --> 28:43.760
Not too bad.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.682
Would you call that a leaf?

28:45.702 --> 28:46.082
Let's see.

28:46.122 --> 28:49.146
They call it two conjugate leaves.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.928
Two conjugate leaves.

28:50.948 --> 28:51.648
That's right.

28:52.349 --> 28:53.911
That's pretty nice.

28:56.153 --> 28:57.315
They usually tell you who bought it.

28:57.335 --> 28:57.935
Who bought that?

28:58.136 --> 28:59.677
No, it says anonymous.

29:01.279 --> 29:05.624
And that's very like the weather, Android weather.

29:05.644 --> 29:06.765
See, because he bought

29:07.167 --> 29:11.471
Here, now you will see the opening.

29:11.491 --> 29:14.594
Here is the title page of the Aeneid.

29:16.496 --> 29:19.198
Actual sign.

29:19.218 --> 29:21.741
Now, this is number... That's 2370.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.643
2370.

29:24.663 --> 29:25.925
Now, this was a whole book.

29:28.968 --> 29:32.391
To bring us out a book that wasn't William Wise's library.

29:32.591 --> 29:34.953
It's our one and only incunable.

29:35.594 --> 29:36.955
Really?

29:38.099 --> 29:51.213
The title is Speculum Morale, the Code of Ethics, printed by Kohlberger in Nuremberg in 1485.

29:52.234 --> 29:56.638
So it is now 505 years old.

29:56.658 --> 30:07.870
And in accordance with Morris's instructions, as you'll see on a letter that's pasted in, it was sold to Robert Steele

30:08.947 --> 30:13.612
rather than it being sold off as part of the library.

30:17.517 --> 30:20.741
And again, you, Mr. Opportunistic guy.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.624
Oh, look at that.

30:24.025 --> 30:27.288
Oh, that's a bigger book.

30:28.089 --> 30:29.030
This is a folio.

30:29.251 --> 30:30.052
What would you call this?

30:30.512 --> 30:31.834
Oh, maybe elephant folio.

30:31.854 --> 30:33.976
Yeah, elephant folio, of course, is not a block.

30:33.996 --> 30:34.617
That's too big.

30:34.816 --> 30:36.258
It's a folio.

30:36.278 --> 30:37.159
Yeah, it's a folio.

30:37.179 --> 30:38.961
Actually, any big book is a folio.

30:39.081 --> 30:40.203
Okay.

30:40.223 --> 30:45.189
Now, the thing that's important, this has a contemporary binding from when it was printed.

30:45.209 --> 30:47.492
It's been repaired, of course.

30:47.512 --> 30:52.057
But it was very dry, and I started putting the stuff in there.

30:53.799 --> 31:00.908
And I started noticing this particular thing, and I wondered, where had I ever seen the...

31:03.571 --> 31:06.695
There it is.

31:06.715 --> 31:07.095
Identical.

31:07.235 --> 31:09.118
I've made robbings of both.

31:09.158 --> 31:12.902
What we're talking about is that this is an incunable.

31:13.082 --> 31:15.105
I-N-C-U-N-A-D-L-E in it.

31:15.826 --> 31:19.830
And we're looking at a large book that is more than 500 years.

31:19.850 --> 31:20.071
505.

31:20.091 --> 31:22.293
505 years old.

31:22.894 --> 31:25.477
And it has a little design, circular design.

31:26.558 --> 31:28.100
It's a rose.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.722
A stylized rose.

31:30.663 --> 31:32.886
This was in the library of William Morris.

31:33.963 --> 31:39.110
And Sandy is trying to, I guess, discern why— Preserve the leather.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.372
Yeah, preserve the leather.

31:40.392 --> 31:44.037
And focused on, why did that design look familiar?

31:45.058 --> 31:49.204
And what did you— And it finally dawned on me, and it got this out.

31:49.224 --> 31:52.528
Then— Got this out being— Got it off the shelf.

31:52.548 --> 31:53.469
The Chaucer we're talking about.

31:53.509 --> 31:54.090
The Chaucer.

31:54.731 --> 31:57.435
The white pigskin binding designed by Morris.

31:58.476 --> 32:02.181
Then it dawned on me, if Morris lifted that,

32:02.650 --> 32:10.257
Maybe he lifted other parts of this design from other books that he had had in his life as a scholar.

32:10.577 --> 32:29.413
So I went to the Morgan Library that has the majority of what was his library at the time he died, and took three afternoons there and looked at 22 blind stamp bindings and found this diamond, found this.

32:31.074 --> 32:31.695
What is this?

32:32.232 --> 32:34.515
this little flower figure.

32:36.057 --> 32:56.581
And Paul Needham had already noted this three-vein leaf design was the same on a Latin Bible from Morris's Library, owned by the Metropolitan Museum.

32:57.882 --> 33:00.265
But then we found, or I found,

33:00.802 --> 33:07.933
Paul Needham took photos of each of these things, this little square, and then the diamond is used to embroider.

33:07.953 --> 33:10.837
So that was fun.

33:10.857 --> 33:13.020
Had Paul found any of these prior to yours?

33:13.120 --> 33:13.381
No.

33:13.421 --> 33:16.525
The only one he noticed was the three-veined leaf.

33:16.866 --> 33:19.149
You know, there's a monograph in this for somebody, isn't there?

33:19.550 --> 33:19.650
Yeah.

33:19.670 --> 33:20.110
It should be.

33:20.131 --> 33:29.965
Well, actually, I've given all that information to Marion Tidcombe, who

33:32.155 --> 33:36.502
I think she works not the British Library.

33:37.304 --> 33:39.087
It should go to Robert Steele.

33:39.588 --> 33:40.830
That's a cultural press.

33:41.471 --> 33:47.201
Well, he says here, he wants this book to go to Robert Steele.

33:47.401 --> 33:47.642
Yes.

33:49.805 --> 33:50.226
You know what?

33:50.246 --> 33:51.268
Here's a copy.

33:51.288 --> 33:52.510
There's something inside here.

33:57.502 --> 33:58.583
This is a great document.

33:58.603 --> 34:02.066
Evaluation of the Library of William Morris, 1896.

34:02.627 --> 34:09.073
So at the time he died, Copper explains the whole thing.

34:09.093 --> 34:09.553
F.S.

34:09.573 --> 34:15.179
Ellis did this handwritten bibliography of the whole library.

34:17.801 --> 34:19.743
These are the books that he read and he owned.

34:20.223 --> 34:25.028
He owned four typographic, let's say.

34:25.328 --> 34:27.390
Has the library for the most quite been dispersed?

34:27.826 --> 34:31.070
No, most of it is here.

34:31.090 --> 34:32.331
Could you just read that?

34:32.351 --> 34:32.591
OK.

34:33.212 --> 34:47.088
This evaluation of the principal books in the Library of William Morris was made soon after his death by Frederick Startridge Ellis, his old friend and former publisher and my co-executor in the Morris estate.

34:47.589 --> 34:51.313
The prices fixed was as near as possible those paid by Morris.

34:51.333 --> 34:57.580
The pencil editions were made by Charles Fairfax Murray, who at one time contemplated

34:59.078 --> 35:00.900
carrying and buying the library.

35:00.920 --> 35:04.584
The actual purchaser, I can't figure it out.

35:04.624 --> 35:22.043
Through Pickering and Chateau, C-H-A-T-T-O, was a Mr. Richard Bennett, who sold a large portion at South of East in December 1898 and sold the remainder to J. Pierpont Morgan of New York, whose catalogs they are fully described.

35:22.063 --> 35:24.706
The price paid by Mr. Bennett was 18,000 pounds.

35:24.726 --> 35:25.707
That's a lot of money.

35:26.969 --> 35:28.090
That's a big box.

35:29.167 --> 35:38.921
But the thing we want to do is to stay alive.

35:38.941 --> 35:39.281
I'm looking.

35:39.301 --> 35:40.443
See, this is so much.

35:41.464 --> 35:42.326
Oh, my God.

35:42.346 --> 35:45.029
Did you ever see anything so beautiful?

35:45.050 --> 35:45.771
The double columns.

35:45.791 --> 35:46.311
It's exquisite.

35:47.253 --> 35:48.875
And the proportion of the mark.

35:48.915 --> 35:51.138
No, this is super patient.

35:51.158 --> 35:54.363
It's incredible patient.

35:54.383 --> 35:54.583
500 years.

35:56.774 --> 36:23.592
so he was just looking at a beautifully printed book with the hand rubricated initials so it's more than the binding it was also for the type of layout proportions the opening you think this is he used this as a what's the word not a primer but uh a model source a model a model and oh

36:24.550 --> 36:27.333
We call it an illuminated letter, I guess.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.955
That's a hell of a nice illuminated letter.

36:29.975 --> 36:31.757
I'll take a picture of that, I think.

36:32.097 --> 36:38.704
See, and it once was in a Capuchin Monastery in Vanburg, 1632.

36:38.804 --> 36:47.512
He said you've reached the stage where you can't afford the super unique, like $1.2 and $3 and $4 million.

36:47.532 --> 36:48.013
That's it.

36:48.453 --> 36:50.355
So I don't need a lot more stuff.

36:50.977 --> 36:58.067
But by the same token, you must have satisfaction in knowing that you got these stuff before these other people discovered them, right?

36:58.367 --> 37:01.832
I can't believe what we've got here.

37:01.852 --> 37:06.578
I couldn't afford to buy what we've got here because of the prices.

37:06.598 --> 37:08.981
Morris was just like with the Art Nouveau.

37:09.782 --> 37:14.669
Nobody really gave much of a damn about Morris in 1860 and 1965.

37:14.689 --> 37:19.836
I told you I was wrong.

37:20.542 --> 37:38.586
This is a manuscript.

37:39.968 --> 37:40.849
You have more letters.

37:41.269 --> 37:42.751
Yeah.

37:42.771 --> 37:44.033
These are all William Morris.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.176
Yeah.

37:46.256 --> 37:49.300
I got a few Xeroxes where I couldn't get the letter.

37:50.495 --> 37:52.757
I mean, you think you have all of them here?

37:52.917 --> 37:53.277
No.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.982
No, I have a few zeroes.

37:58.002 --> 37:59.983
I have actually a lot of zeroes.

38:00.063 --> 38:01.425
Are these arranged chronologically?

38:01.585 --> 38:03.226
Yes, chronologically.

38:03.266 --> 38:03.486
How many?

38:03.506 --> 38:06.769
There are over a hundred.

38:06.809 --> 38:07.770
They're substantive.

38:07.790 --> 38:08.751
They're discussing... Oh, yeah.

38:10.793 --> 38:19.000
Now, here's the translation of one of the Icelandic sagas with...

38:19.621 --> 38:25.788
The original manuscript on 22 leaves in the autograph of Eriker Magnusson.

38:25.808 --> 38:27.310
M-A-G-N-U-S-S-O-N.

38:28.512 --> 38:33.638
Filled with corrections and alterations in the handwriting of William Morris.

38:35.039 --> 38:39.785
Also, two verses of poetry in his autograph.

38:40.025 --> 38:41.707
E-R-I-K-R.

38:45.732 --> 38:47.434
E-I-R-I-K-R.

38:48.190 --> 38:50.173
It's a screwy spell.

38:50.853 --> 38:51.034
E-I-R.

38:52.996 --> 38:55.099
Here, wait till I... No, don't bother.

38:55.119 --> 38:56.240
That's okay.

38:56.661 --> 38:57.041
That's all right.

38:57.101 --> 39:00.946
I think that I can ascertain that myself.

39:00.966 --> 39:03.489
All right.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.812
Everything is, too.

39:06.473 --> 39:16.746
E-I-R-I-K-R-M-A-G-N-U-S-S-O-N with an accent over the second I in Erica and over the U.

39:17.654 --> 39:24.063
and Magnuson, coming down upper right to left.

39:24.083 --> 39:26.326
That's the 2,102 books so far.

39:28.670 --> 39:29.631
That's from the computer.

39:29.651 --> 39:34.218
That's the catalog, 2,200 books, which you are entering in the computer.

39:34.238 --> 39:35.099
And these are the printouts?

39:35.239 --> 39:38.143
These are the printouts.

39:38.163 --> 39:43.731
You see, Magnuson sort of did what he considered a good, straightforward translation.

39:43.851 --> 39:47.256
Morris had other ideas.

39:49.868 --> 39:52.472
Heavily annotated.

39:52.492 --> 39:57.760
And in some ways the whole paragraph was taken out.

39:57.780 --> 40:00.604
He did everything himself, didn't he?

40:01.846 --> 40:07.093
That's why he learned the language, so he could put his own, tell it his own way.

40:08.556 --> 40:10.859
I wonder why he was so fixed on this particular story.

40:11.380 --> 40:13.102
Oh, he did all of the Norse.

40:13.303 --> 40:14.324
Here.

40:14.665 --> 40:15.486
I won't bring him here.

40:15.546 --> 40:18.230
Just come and look.

40:18.250 --> 40:18.390
Right.

40:19.248 --> 40:38.749
McHale, who was married to Byrne Jones's daughter, wrote the first biography, and he had all the documents from both families, from the Morris family and the Byrne Jones family, and they asked him to do it.

40:38.809 --> 40:46.417
He was a classical teacher, Greek and Latin, at Cambridge.

40:46.437 --> 40:48.259
So he did the two volumes.

40:49.690 --> 40:53.115
I'll have to consult it, obviously.

40:53.135 --> 41:06.352
It's going to have to be... Well, you just... I mean, you've given us a tour through... You said earlier that this... I guess I'm still interested in the passion for this.

41:09.056 --> 41:10.378
It started with books, by the way.

41:10.398 --> 41:11.599
I think we should point that out.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.723
And it's become everything.

41:15.765 --> 41:19.630
And when you began collecting the books,

41:20.487 --> 41:23.130
Did you feel you knew the man at all?

41:25.031 --> 41:26.733
Where do you begin to know the man?

41:26.773 --> 41:32.359
I guess that's one way to get into it.

41:32.379 --> 41:33.440
The passion for Morris.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.561
Why just Morris?

41:34.801 --> 41:40.246
This has really been a very focused collection.

41:41.588 --> 41:47.153
It's important to think of him

41:48.668 --> 42:14.946
for what he did as an individual, but it's equally important to realize he had such an inspiring energy that he stimulated this circle of artists to do great things that they wouldn't have done otherwise.

42:17.187 --> 42:21.533
There's a great quotation by Berne Jones when Morris died.

42:24.157 --> 42:39.058
It shouldn't be paraphrased, but it's to the effect that Morris was the strength, the tower, the banner.

42:39.980 --> 42:47.110
He was the whole sort of leader in the ultimate sense.

42:47.832 --> 42:56.561
that these guys followed and did more than they were capable of doing.

42:56.581 --> 43:02.187
So it's more than just Morris individual.

43:02.287 --> 43:06.671
It's Morris and his circle of people.

43:06.831 --> 43:12.557
And I think he made a point of that.

43:21.667 --> 43:32.104
In the minute book—see, at first it was called Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Company.

43:32.124 --> 43:41.700
The minute book—I can mention this to you upstairs—he agreed that the names of the designers of cartoons be withheld from the public.

43:42.997 --> 43:49.764
See, this followed after saying, agreed that Rossetti should make a drawing of the crucifixion at the Dedicoke window.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.468
Jones, do one of the nativity for the sidelight.

43:54.068 --> 43:56.531
Morris, one of the resurrection for the other.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.653
And this is funny.

43:58.673 --> 44:04.439
And that Jones price be five pounds, but that Morris only have three pounds.

44:04.479 --> 44:09.064
See, Morris was taking a minute, so he was putting a little jab in there.

44:09.084 --> 44:11.046
Well, why did he want the anonymity, do you think?

44:11.347 --> 44:14.670
Because he wanted it to be the firm.

44:14.710 --> 44:16.072
They used that expression.

44:17.253 --> 44:20.476
The firm was this Morris Marshall Company.

44:21.457 --> 44:26.763
And I think he was proud of the fact that.

44:27.503 --> 44:32.589
You know, I, by definition almost, is the expression of one individual.

44:32.609 --> 44:33.409
Yeah?

44:33.710 --> 44:40.657
They say that the only time anything has ever been done well by a committee, certainly in writing, is the King James Bible.

44:40.677 --> 44:40.797
Okay.

44:41.553 --> 44:52.989
Yet here you have really artistic expression by a group that is insisting on anonymity, and they want the product of the group.

44:53.009 --> 44:57.656
I guess maybe this is something that Morris was passionate about?

44:57.676 --> 44:59.218
This is what he wanted.

45:00.841 --> 45:02.423
Did he think he was producing art?

45:02.543 --> 45:05.447
Did he realize he was producing art by just beautiful things?

45:06.689 --> 45:09.513
Was it craft to him, or was it art?

45:09.533 --> 45:10.935
How's that?

45:11.320 --> 45:24.873
You hit on the real crux of what Morris was concerned about, was to cease having a separation of art and craft.

45:24.893 --> 45:32.701
That's why I included that little quote about the artist is the craftsman, and the craftsman is the artist.

45:32.721 --> 45:39.808
And even though Morris would do the design, as you quote, he would rely

45:40.278 --> 45:51.555
on the tapestry weaver to design the detail of the Mille Fleur flowers and select the colors.

45:54.138 --> 46:04.974
And especially with Mrs. Holliday, the embroiderer, he left all kinds of things up for hair to do within his framework of design.

46:06.076 --> 46:10.082
So he didn't have an ego trip of

46:10.282 --> 46:16.348
But he was first among equals, do you think?

46:17.329 --> 46:19.671
I'm not sure what that really says.

46:19.731 --> 46:22.834
We're all equal, but I'm more equal than the rest of you.

46:24.255 --> 46:31.082
I'm not sure whether he would... Well, why did he insist on controlling everything?

46:31.202 --> 46:32.403
It's almost contradictory.

46:32.423 --> 46:38.449
Oh, to make certain that the result was going to be as good as it could be.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.393
That was primary.

46:42.855 --> 46:45.318
The final product had to speak for itself.

46:54.069 --> 47:05.664
He wanted you to be happy to do it over as many times as it took to get it just right.

47:05.684 --> 47:08.908
All these trial designs where

47:09.175 --> 47:12.319
It's too close and it's too far apart.

47:12.339 --> 47:14.261
Oh, now that's just right.

47:14.281 --> 47:17.626
But who was the final average of what he was doing?

47:20.970 --> 47:24.574
See, and his compositor started to complain.

47:25.355 --> 47:27.358
We've done this four times.

47:27.638 --> 47:29.841
That's right, I'm paying you.

47:29.861 --> 47:31.563
Got to get it just right.

47:31.683 --> 47:36.369
And little by little, they saw that it was worth doing.

47:38.191 --> 47:38.912
Was he possessed?

47:39.230 --> 47:40.992
Okay.

47:41.072 --> 47:47.858
Now, I've got a theory about that that I haven't read, anyway.

47:47.878 --> 48:07.397
The terrible timing of the young Byrne Jones and Morris becoming friends with Rossetti.

48:08.997 --> 48:14.042
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who was, you might say, fifteen years older.

48:15.023 --> 48:21.329
He was the instigator and the leader of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

48:23.712 --> 48:37.165
So, here we are, fifteen years later, when the Brotherhood had pretty well dissolved, that Morris and Berne Jones become aware of Rossetti's writings and his paintings.

48:38.393 --> 48:43.360
And Rossetti gets the commission to do the murals in the Oxford debating hall.

48:44.161 --> 48:56.938
And Rossetti hires, that's in quote, Byrne Jones and Morris and Val Princep, a couple of the other young guys, to help them do these frescoes.

48:56.958 --> 48:57.879
Now, let's back up.

48:57.979 --> 49:06.190
For 11 years up to this point, Rossetti had been living with his model, Elizabeth Siddle.

49:08.296 --> 49:12.022
And she was frantically eager to get him to marry her.

49:15.067 --> 49:17.991
And she was getting sicker and sicker, you know, whatever.

49:18.953 --> 49:24.381
And so everybody pressured Rosetti, marry her already, which he did.

49:26.344 --> 49:34.557
No sooner had that happened than here's Rosetti with this commission to do in Oxford, the murals, and

49:35.245 --> 49:53.466
they meet at a theater, or they see at a theater, the woman that Rossetti spotted as being the identity of the pre-Raphaelite woman incarnate.

49:53.486 --> 50:05.100
So he introduces himself and asks her to pose for these murals, and he's fallen head over heels in love with her, and she with him.

50:08.017 --> 50:28.180
But because of this recent wedding, marriage, it ended up with Morris asking her to marry, which she agreed to because it was the only way for her to get out of this dire poverty that she had grown up in and was living in in Oxford.

50:30.163 --> 50:36.510
And here Morris, you might say, sent her to finishing school and— When he married her?

50:36.530 --> 50:36.690
Oh, yes.

50:36.991 --> 50:39.234
With a husband and wife?

50:39.635 --> 50:44.843
Oh, yes, and they had two daughters, May and Jenny.

50:44.863 --> 50:47.447
But here he installed her before they got married.

50:47.527 --> 50:53.756
He installed her with a family, with servants, so she could learn how to run a household with servants.

50:53.856 --> 51:05.614
And the whole thing, he turned her into a suitable wife of William Morris, who had grown up in this high level of high standards.

51:07.602 --> 51:19.097
Well, no sooner had they had the two daughters in the first two years of their marriage, but she takes the kids and goes to live with Rosetti.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.759
Or no, wait a minute, there's an interim.

51:21.901 --> 51:28.950
She starts getting together with Rosetti, and that drives Rosetti's wife to commit suicide.

51:30.252 --> 51:36.580
Then she moves in with the kids, and Morris says to his friends,

51:37.015 --> 51:39.458
I've got to be manly about this.

51:40.278 --> 51:42.281
We mustn't have a scandal."

51:42.301 --> 51:43.141
It was very British.

51:43.522 --> 51:46.425
Unthinkable, exactly.

51:46.445 --> 51:51.230
So he wrote to her almost every day and became the visitor and the kids there.

51:52.691 --> 52:05.605
Well, my theory is he was so full of fury, and rather than directing the fury and throttling all of them, he

52:06.631 --> 52:07.872
It just was driven.

52:08.152 --> 52:09.434
That's what reminded me.

52:09.454 --> 52:10.454
He was driven.

52:10.575 --> 52:11.876
You said, was he driven?

52:11.896 --> 52:15.059
You think it was because of the marital with the triangle.

52:15.339 --> 52:20.523
Was he aware of Rossetti's, of the obsession that these two had for each other when he married her?

52:21.524 --> 52:23.866
I mean, did he know about it?

52:23.886 --> 52:25.248
He figured, hey, I'm William Morris.

52:25.328 --> 52:26.309
You'll fall for me, right?

52:26.889 --> 52:28.170
Sure.

52:28.511 --> 52:32.454
It doesn't happen.

52:32.494 --> 52:35.777
I think that could account for how does— There's a theory.

52:36.010 --> 52:38.413
Is this based on anything that you have, that you've read?

52:38.613 --> 52:48.103
Well, all the statements I made about what they each did is all published.

52:48.123 --> 53:03.739
But nobody's ever extrapolated those events into why— How he channeled the— Here, when Morris died, and they asked the doctor what did he die of, he answered, he died

53:04.445 --> 53:15.958
of being William Morris and doing the work of ten people, because he literally did totally exhaust himself.

53:15.978 --> 53:16.940
Worked himself to death.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.101
Worked himself to death.

53:20.243 --> 53:23.487
And that's why at 62, he lived in 82.

53:24.008 --> 53:27.031
You think if the wife hadn't left him, he wouldn't have been William Morris?

53:27.372 --> 53:31.937
I'd love to know.

53:32.525 --> 53:38.594
He would have been pretty impressive because before he met her, he was writing poetry out of the blue.

53:38.694 --> 53:42.400
He's long as a freshman at Oxford.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.563
The rest of the guys couldn't imagine.

53:44.603 --> 53:45.865
How could he do that?

53:46.005 --> 53:50.291
Did that end his relationships with women when she left him?

53:50.311 --> 53:53.075
I mean, did he really celibate one woman?

53:55.119 --> 54:00.186
As far as I know, he was physically celibate.

54:00.875 --> 54:05.922
But he was deeply in love with Berne Jones' wife, and that's why he did.

54:06.402 --> 54:07.844
I don't think he ever touched her.

54:07.864 --> 54:08.765
Victorians, huh?

54:08.785 --> 54:09.406
Who could believe it?

54:09.426 --> 54:11.889
I don't think he ever touched her.

54:11.909 --> 54:17.056
But he did those two manuscripts as gifts to her.

54:17.897 --> 54:21.542
You're pointing, as he says.

54:24.906 --> 54:29.312
You do that for a woman you love.

54:30.372 --> 54:32.135
We're not a casual acquaintance.

54:33.637 --> 54:35.219
But I don't think he ever touched her.

54:35.940 --> 54:42.309
Now, another woman who was very important to him was Aglaia Coronio.

54:43.631 --> 54:46.275
And I have 35 letters he wrote to her.

54:47.217 --> 54:48.018
How do you spell her name?

54:49.059 --> 54:50.241
Aglaia.

54:50.622 --> 54:58.273
A-G-L-A-I-A C-O-R-O-N-I-O.

54:59.094 --> 54:59.755
And she was

55:00.123 --> 55:10.274
It came from a Greek family, the Ionides family, who was one of the major patrons of Morris and Company.

55:10.294 --> 55:23.889
Morris designed the whole interior for the Ionides house, and Agileo, I think, was one of the daughters or cousins he met through Ionides.

55:23.909 --> 55:30.096
So, to answer your question of being celibate, I choose to believe physically, yes.

55:31.038 --> 55:42.109
But mentally, spiritually, whatever you want to call it, he was deeply in love with these other two women, I don't know.

55:42.129 --> 55:43.391
It's a work of love.

55:43.531 --> 55:43.651
It is.

55:43.671 --> 55:44.292
It's a work of love.

55:44.312 --> 55:44.532
Absolutely.

55:44.552 --> 55:51.920
Well, the title, the book of verse, comes from the Rubioff, you know, a loaf of bread, a book of verse, and the... That's right.

55:52.660 --> 55:54.322
And it's pretty Freudian.

55:54.362 --> 55:55.583
Freud would sit down.

55:55.603 --> 55:59.087
I mean, you would never do this post-Freud.

55:59.540 --> 56:00.842
You know, at the time of life.

56:01.002 --> 56:01.743
Okay.

56:01.823 --> 56:02.925
You'd be self-conscious.

56:02.965 --> 56:05.228
I think you said, my God, what are they going to read into this?

56:05.289 --> 56:08.153
Everybody's going to know that.

56:08.513 --> 56:11.378
I mean, we can see what William Morris has done to your life.

56:12.119 --> 56:14.823
Tell me what it's done personally.

56:14.843 --> 56:21.072
Oh, well, it's made retirement.

56:21.092 --> 56:28.483
I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have something that keeps getting better every day.

56:29.746 --> 56:31.408
Are you learning things about them that you do?

56:31.488 --> 56:32.549
All the time.

56:33.150 --> 56:45.865
People are, well, partly from what I'm, the best thing about cataloging, remember those books I snuck in onto the shelf 20 years ago?

56:45.925 --> 56:51.992
I haven't looked at them since until now when I take them off the shelf to catalog.

56:53.173 --> 56:58.960
So instead of taking five minutes to catalog a book, I start looking at the pages.

56:59.328 --> 57:07.957
I didn't know what I was buying or where it related.

57:08.318 --> 57:13.163
What is it to hold and to feel holographic manuscripts?

57:13.183 --> 57:15.165
That's the greatest.

57:15.185 --> 57:19.410
Let me show you the most recent thing.

57:19.430 --> 57:23.635
This blows my mind.

57:23.655 --> 57:25.116
This blows my mind.

57:25.136 --> 57:26.618
I got this gift about a month ago.

57:27.745 --> 57:33.031
So the collection is constantly being added to, I think we should point out, and he's taking it out of the mileage.

57:33.051 --> 57:35.553
You've got to feel the real thing.

57:35.573 --> 57:36.895
Let's put this pen in here.

57:37.075 --> 57:37.415
Yeah.

57:37.435 --> 57:38.276
That's good.

57:39.137 --> 57:40.999
Hold that piece of paper.

57:41.019 --> 57:42.701
Read the note there.

57:42.721 --> 57:52.872
This is done by William Morris while working on a... While... While working on a... While serving.

57:52.912 --> 57:57.617
While serving on a committee of the SPAB.

57:58.036 --> 58:05.066
on the evening of 31 March 1892, Zachary Turner.

58:05.647 --> 58:12.356
This is the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which was started by William Morris.

58:12.376 --> 58:24.874
And what it shows is one, two, three, four, perhaps a dozen doodles, not unlike the calligraphy that Sandy Berger did while sitting on the Berkeley or whatever it is.

58:24.894 --> 58:25.535
Planning Commission.

58:25.555 --> 58:27.638
Planning Commission.

58:27.837 --> 58:28.879
There are residences there.

58:28.899 --> 58:35.028
But you see, this is at the time of the Kelmscott press, and he's doing ornaments.

58:36.831 --> 58:40.296
And you just got this.

58:40.316 --> 58:44.823
Did the person who sold this to you know that these were Kelmscott press ornaments?

58:45.204 --> 58:47.908
No, he just did.

58:47.988 --> 58:50.291
How did he describe it?

58:50.492 --> 58:51.313
Original pencils are done.

58:51.614 --> 58:54.237
But you knew instantly these were Kelm Scott Plus ornaments.

58:54.257 --> 58:59.942
Well, it's the right date, and they sure look like a lot of these ornaments.

58:59.962 --> 59:05.367
I got this the 23rd of May.

59:05.387 --> 59:09.111
I feel it.

59:09.131 --> 59:12.854
I'm talking about what it's like to feel the original piece.

59:12.874 --> 59:14.396
And it's got swudges on the back.

59:15.437 --> 59:16.598
But he kept it, didn't he?

59:17.559 --> 59:19.421
Zachary did.

59:20.081 --> 59:20.862
He was a painter.

59:21.095 --> 59:24.839
Oh, so this is, oh, in other words, this is Factory Turner who wrote this.

59:24.859 --> 59:25.981
Oh, he wrote that.

59:26.001 --> 59:27.803
He's identifying it as.

59:27.823 --> 59:29.305
And so Morris just left it.

59:29.345 --> 59:30.186
Oh, of course.

59:30.226 --> 59:31.407
He left it or threw it.

59:31.427 --> 59:33.390
And this guy just slammed it, right?

59:33.510 --> 59:34.531
Oh, yeah.

59:34.611 --> 59:36.193
No dummy.

59:36.213 --> 59:38.476
Would you have turned ahead and signed that?

59:38.496 --> 59:40.178
Would you have recognized that as a work of Morris?

59:40.198 --> 59:42.100
I'd like to think so.

59:42.120 --> 59:46.545
I would like to think I would think that has Morris' characteristics.

59:49.816 --> 59:58.230
Yeah, I've got enough other doodles of his to say, yeah, that's close enough that I would say so.

59:59.532 --> 01:00:01.655
So, 19—how long has he been retired?

01:00:01.695 --> 01:00:09.748
You say it's been—it's made retirement, uh— Eight years.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:17.140
So, at that point— Oh, I also wanted to ask, for all the period I was working,

01:00:18.217 --> 01:00:21.904
It made weekends the greatest.

01:00:21.924 --> 01:00:23.046
You'd come down here.

01:00:23.066 --> 01:00:23.306
Sure.

01:00:23.607 --> 01:00:35.268
I'd come back here Thursday night, play golf Friday morning, and then have Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday any time I could squeeze away from chores.

01:00:38.013 --> 01:00:38.795
Immerse yourself.

01:00:38.915 --> 01:00:39.316
Immerse myself.

01:00:39.997 --> 01:00:41.119
And you know the men.
