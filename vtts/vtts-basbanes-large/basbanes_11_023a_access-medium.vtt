WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:31.590
Okay.

00:32.060 --> 00:48.456
It was in 1970 when the Georgian monks from Lavra moved here and enlarged the monastery and built a new monastery and took their name.

00:49.277 --> 00:53.722
One of them, the second abbot and the son of the first abbot, St.

00:54.162 --> 00:59.147
Deftimius, is considered the most important scholar in the medieval in Georgia.

01:00.207 --> 01:02.330
He has translated 55 works.

01:03.231 --> 01:07.216
And also he has written some, in Greek, some texts.

01:07.276 --> 01:13.364
When he came here, he continued his translations, which were started in Lavra.

01:13.865 --> 01:18.131
And his disciples were copying them.

01:20.073 --> 01:23.638
From that time, the library and the scriptorium started functioning here.

01:24.679 --> 01:27.683
The first books came from Georgia.

01:28.118 --> 01:32.364
ordered by one of the founders, General Tornikius, who was named Jonas Manc.

01:33.125 --> 01:34.887
He went to Georgia in 178.

01:36.970 --> 01:38.011
May I just ask a question?

01:38.091 --> 01:39.653
Where was the scriptorium?

01:39.713 --> 01:42.337
Is there any evidence of the scriptorium here?

01:42.437 --> 01:44.520
So there is no evidence of it left.

01:45.521 --> 01:57.737
So there was a Georgian scriptorium, but also a Greek scriptorium, because we know about a certain scribe named Theophanes.

01:58.308 --> 02:02.613
Who wrote some... Here.

02:03.495 --> 02:10.824
1004 and 1023.

02:10.964 --> 02:26.644
In the middle of the 11th century, a school was founded by another abbot,

02:26.995 --> 02:27.456
by St.

02:27.476 --> 02:36.206
George III, who also translated a lot of books, liturgical books mostly, from Greek into Georgian.

02:36.387 --> 02:38.329
Which books, Greek into Georgian?

02:38.369 --> 02:39.210
Greek into Georgian, yes.

02:39.591 --> 02:40.852
Greek and Georgian were Georgians.

02:40.872 --> 02:41.613
Here, on Athens?

02:41.993 --> 02:47.981
Yes, about 20 minutes walk from the monastery, in an old monastery, St.

02:48.001 --> 02:48.882
John the theologian.

02:50.904 --> 02:55.450
At first he brought 80 orphans from Georgia there,

02:56.273 --> 03:01.721
And a lot of scholars came out from that school and a lot of translations were made.

03:01.761 --> 03:08.450
There are some Georgian translations existing without their Greek prototype.

03:09.291 --> 03:11.194
So it exists through the Georgian?

03:11.454 --> 03:15.720
Yes.

03:16.561 --> 03:20.627
Georgians say that if that school today

03:20.995 --> 03:23.618
Ascetical and Philological School of Iberum.

03:23.678 --> 03:27.182
If that school did not exist, the history of Georgia will be different.

03:27.202 --> 03:28.543
What was the name of the school again?

03:28.763 --> 03:32.928
Ascetical and Philological School of Iberum.

03:33.188 --> 03:37.092
Ascetical and Philological School.

03:37.132 --> 03:38.534
This is very important to me.

03:39.014 --> 03:44.921
Ascetic, yes.

03:46.462 --> 03:48.464
So this lasted till 1200.

03:48.925 --> 03:50.867
Then there were some difficulties in Georgia.

03:51.303 --> 04:03.881
So, the monks, the people who came from Georgia to be monks here, and there were some destructions in the monastery.

04:04.822 --> 04:14.897
The monastery comes back to the good days after 1500.

04:15.097 --> 04:22.124
At that time, we know from that time till 1900, we know a lot of Greek scribes working here.

04:22.824 --> 04:24.826
There were not a lot, or there were?

04:25.026 --> 04:25.687
There?

04:25.707 --> 04:27.729
There were a lot or there were not a lot?

04:28.330 --> 04:30.031
You said there were a lot of Greek scribes?

04:30.311 --> 04:30.912
A lot, a lot.

04:30.992 --> 04:31.372
There were?

04:32.193 --> 04:32.734
There were.

04:32.834 --> 04:33.715
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:37.158 --> 04:38.519
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.623
So the monastery was a center of...

04:43.362 --> 04:46.887
studies in that period between 1500 and 1900.

04:46.907 --> 04:51.873
A lot of scholars came from the monastery, stayed some years, copied books.

04:52.594 --> 04:57.600
Other scholars offered their collections to the monastery.

05:00.144 --> 05:04.489
We can mention the two most important offerings to the monastery.

05:04.850 --> 05:12.880
One was the collection of Maximus Margunius in 1600, who was the most important theologian of that time.

05:12.944 --> 05:21.673
living in Italy in Venice and Padova, and offered nine cases of books for the monastery.

05:22.394 --> 05:24.075
And the most of them are in Latin.

05:26.378 --> 05:32.664
In 1678, Patriarch Dionysius IV offered his collection a lot of books.

05:32.684 --> 05:35.647
We don't know exactly how many, but a lot.

05:37.869 --> 05:41.753
Also, you see, there were some losses.

05:42.762 --> 05:59.297
During the Renaissance, people sent by the... by some... Like you say, a princess from Italy.

05:59.457 --> 06:02.560
They were sent to some representatives here to collect books.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.324
A delegation, as I was saying.

06:07.344 --> 06:10.947
Some scholars come in, sent by the princess from Italy.

06:11.028 --> 06:12.710
Emissaries or something like that?

06:12.730 --> 06:15.353
Yes, emissaries of the Pope, of the French kings.

06:16.454 --> 06:19.198
And they took a lot of classical books.

06:19.218 --> 06:20.018
Now, how did they take?

06:20.219 --> 06:20.799
They stole?

06:21.540 --> 06:25.485
Some of them they were stole, some of them they bought, some of them they were offered.

06:27.988 --> 06:40.242
Also, the charge of Russia and Patrick's Russia wanted Greek originals in order to correct their translations.

06:40.762 --> 06:51.399
One emissary of those of the Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich and the Patriarch Nikon.

06:52.181 --> 06:57.770
Monk Arsenei Sukhanov took 158 manuscripts from our library.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.815
498 from Mount Athos.

07:01.215 --> 07:01.896
Who is this again?

07:03.018 --> 07:04.100
Arsenei Sukhanov.

07:05.021 --> 07:07.225
Okay.

07:10.428 --> 07:24.487
In 1725, some emissaries from the Pope of Rome were offered with 15 manuscripts of patristic texts.

07:27.010 --> 07:39.287
In the last years of last century, 19 Georgian books were disappeared and now they are in Tbilisi.

07:40.786 --> 07:45.734
And in our century also some books were lost in the beginning of our century.

07:45.954 --> 07:49.800
One of them in Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.003
Did Curzon take any of the books from here?

07:52.304 --> 07:57.231
Robert Curzon, he's the English man who took books from the British Library?

07:57.311 --> 07:58.894
No, no, no.

07:59.615 --> 08:04.482
He wrote that the monks denied to give him any book here.

08:05.862 --> 08:08.406
I'm going to write about him in here.

08:08.666 --> 08:13.032
He came and he stole, as far as I'm concerned, and he gloated about it.

08:13.072 --> 08:14.614
Terrible.

08:15.676 --> 08:20.843
And now we have about 2,130 Greek manuscripts.

08:21.524 --> 08:23.567
2,130 Greek.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.470
Which is the sixth largest collection in the world.

08:27.833 --> 08:32.680
Among them there are 479 manuscripts on Byzantine music.

08:33.166 --> 08:42.460
The largest, officially, the largest collection in the world, really is the second largest, because there are some books, somewhere hidden.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.521
In another collection?

08:43.541 --> 08:45.244
In another collection, yes.

08:45.424 --> 08:51.914
There is another collection that has more books on wizarding music, but not yet... Disclosed, as they say.

08:51.934 --> 08:53.056
Yes, they are disclosed.

08:53.076 --> 08:54.538
So officially is the largest.

08:54.558 --> 08:57.482
Officially is the first place, at least.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.886
Yes.

08:59.906 --> 09:02.650
Better there than the British Museum, you know.

09:03.305 --> 09:19.539
You know, some days before, two or three days before, a Georgian scholar came here, a member of the Academy of Sciences in Georgia, and he went to the British Museum and he was shown a polio of an old Georgian codex.

09:20.119 --> 09:23.842
And he thought that he was the handwriting of St.

09:23.862 --> 09:24.623
George, I mentioned.

09:25.424 --> 09:30.248
To see the other codexes written by St.

09:30.788 --> 09:32.529
George, we have nine... A St.

09:32.549 --> 09:33.210
George here?

09:33.629 --> 09:51.331
And yes, and he understood that it really was an autograph message that followed in a British museum that goes in a Greek codex.

09:51.852 --> 09:56.217
So he says that perhaps this codex came from... How about printed books?

09:56.277 --> 09:59.181
How many printed books do you have?

09:59.201 --> 10:00.162
Let me say some more.

10:00.182 --> 10:00.623
Yes, please.

10:01.003 --> 10:03.366
And I had it... No, pardon.

10:03.548 --> 10:10.095
95 Georgian manuscripts, which is considered the most important collection outside Georgia.

10:11.156 --> 10:13.479
Half of them are dated in 10th and 11th centuries.

10:13.879 --> 10:24.831
We also have some 70 manuscripts in Slavic languages, nine in Romanian, seven in Arabic, one in Coptic, and one in Italian.

10:26.954 --> 10:31.058
We have the most important collection of printed books on Athos.

10:31.814 --> 10:38.362
About 1,000 books published between 1480 and 1600.

10:38.963 --> 10:42.047
About 10,000 books published between 1600 and 1900.

10:42.447 --> 10:55.844
Many of them, a lot of them come from the collections of scholars, of important scholars, and in the margins they have their own written notes and so on.

10:55.984 --> 10:58.668
Annotations and important, pardon?

10:58.688 --> 11:00.690
Their annotations, I guess I call them, yes.

11:02.358 --> 11:04.280
Marginalia.

11:04.881 --> 11:08.365
So here there are some books of Byzantine music.

11:08.686 --> 11:14.393
1825 by Chander in Agia Sophia in Constantinople.

11:14.633 --> 11:20.260
A famous musician, a famous composer and monk of our monastery, Cosmas the Macedonian.

11:22.062 --> 11:25.766
And here is the miniature of Saint John of Damascus.

11:26.768 --> 11:29.631
This is written in the same period, not dated,

11:30.100 --> 11:33.083
by another famous composer, Balasius the priest.

11:33.303 --> 11:34.164
He's depicted here.

11:34.725 --> 11:36.947
This is here.

11:36.987 --> 11:40.811
This is in the same time, some years before the 1700s.

11:41.212 --> 11:48.739
One of the three composers who introduced the new notation, the now-used notation of the Byzantine music, Hormuzas and Hortophilax.

11:49.480 --> 11:59.010
Here it's a psalter written in 1346 in Constantinople by a famous scribe, the monk Hariton of the monastery of Odigon.

11:59.547 --> 12:05.152
and belonged to the Empress Anna Palaiologina, the aunt of Savoy married to John IV Palaiologos.

12:06.013 --> 12:07.674
So this must have come as a gift.

12:07.694 --> 12:07.955
Yes.

12:08.435 --> 12:10.397
Yes, perhaps by the patriarch.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.238
It was written in gold.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.600
On parchment.

12:13.620 --> 12:14.261
On parchment, yes.

12:14.581 --> 12:15.742
All on parchment, probably.

12:15.822 --> 12:16.403
Not all.

12:16.423 --> 12:17.183
Those are on paper.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.044
That's paper, yeah.

12:18.064 --> 12:20.026
It's on parchment, written in circa 1200.

12:20.927 --> 12:24.170
And the pages are written in gross-like shape.

12:24.350 --> 12:27.833
There are some small lines, some larger ones.

12:28.049 --> 12:29.871
and then some other, some smaller.

12:30.432 --> 12:34.396
And each one out of the four existed in the world, really like that.

12:35.818 --> 12:40.663
And its cover is dated in circa 1600, it's gilded.

12:43.906 --> 12:51.295
The book published in Moscow, in Slavonic, in 1688, the Gospel, with very large letters.

12:51.695 --> 12:55.339
It was offered to the monastery by three

12:55.555 --> 13:07.289
The four gospels, the four great feasts, Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, replaced with Greek text, with Greek manuscript text, written by hand.

13:07.309 --> 13:13.477
And so the gospel was read from this book during those feasts.

13:13.497 --> 13:17.181
Eccles were holding them at 124.

13:17.261 --> 13:19.644
27 kilos, I think.

13:19.944 --> 13:23.048
It would need at least two.

13:23.551 --> 13:40.550
During the Greek Revolution, in 1823, when the Turkish invaded Mount Athos, they kept as prisoners the 80 monks, the most important monks of Mount Athos, in the Salonican White Tower, and demanded a lot of money as ransom.

13:41.131 --> 13:42.712
The monastries didn't have some money.

13:42.853 --> 13:48.439
Some of the monastries gave some of the precious things in order to take them.

13:50.341 --> 13:52.984
Even to a Turkish official,

13:53.437 --> 13:57.343
in Kortse in Albania for 2860 kyrus.

13:57.783 --> 14:11.583
In the first page there is a petition of the monks to the inhabitants of Kortse to find the money and give them to the Iglesia.

14:11.944 --> 14:22.279
So the... best illuminated Byzantine Gospels

14:22.867 --> 14:31.038
with 37 miniatures, written in the middle of the 13th century.

14:31.058 --> 14:43.235
All of the miniatures, the miniatures of the Fire Evangelists, are the prototypes of a whole group of manuscripts, Byzantine-illuminating manuscripts, out of the group, if you're on five, this is number five of our library.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.319
Written by St.

14:46.339 --> 14:52.688
Theophilus Demir Streamer, the most well-known, the most important scribe living in our monastery.

14:53.360 --> 15:04.257
He lived here between 1511 and 1523, for 12 years, and wrote 30 manuscripts.

15:06.261 --> 15:09.345
This is written for his own use.

15:09.365 --> 15:14.894
It contains the Gospels, the four Gospels, the Psalter, and some services, hymns, and prayers.

15:15.535 --> 15:21.004
And in the last pages, it contains his will.

15:23.836 --> 15:26.999
I'm sorry, this one here.

15:27.019 --> 15:27.900
1715-18.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.584
Right, there's the name under there.

15:31.604 --> 15:31.845
809.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.267
Codex 809.

15:38.031 --> 15:41.975
Most important, does it have it here?

15:41.995 --> 15:43.477
By Saint Theophilus.

15:43.677 --> 15:44.398
Theophilus, yes.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.123
I'm just taking notes and listening.

15:49.143 --> 15:52.847
And this is written circa 1620.

15:53.333 --> 16:01.587
by another famous scribe, Matthew Metropolitan of Myra, who perhaps spent some years in our monastery, and it contains the Akafist hymn.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.192
There is a salutations to the mother of God.

16:05.895 --> 16:07.878
You see, it's... It's 1626.

16:08.018 --> 16:09.922
It's 1626.

16:09.942 --> 16:13.408
It's the Codex.

16:13.628 --> 16:16.573
I'm writing that down too, so I can identify it later if I have to.

16:17.228 --> 16:18.870
with the initial letters.

16:18.990 --> 16:19.750
That's beautiful.

16:19.830 --> 16:20.851
That's magnificent.

16:20.871 --> 16:22.573
That's some of the best calligraphy I've seen.

16:22.753 --> 16:24.575
Yes, it's one of the most famous.

16:24.595 --> 16:25.716
That was done here as well.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.578
Yes, yes.

16:27.598 --> 16:31.121
So did this attract some of the, this monastery attract some of the greatest?

16:31.501 --> 16:32.442
Yes, yes.

16:32.462 --> 16:34.024
As I told you, yes.

16:34.304 --> 16:46.155
Some of them were coming here, spending some years here, studying, copying the manuscripts, and then went away.

16:46.642 --> 16:52.611
a letter of 1585 to another one.

16:52.651 --> 16:56.276
He says that Abbott here is very good to scholars.

16:56.717 --> 17:00.983
He does not put them to do heavy works and so on.

17:01.283 --> 17:02.285
Allows them to.

17:02.305 --> 17:03.487
Yes.

17:04.608 --> 17:09.575
Also, another loss I didn't mention is with Athonia School.

17:09.636 --> 17:15.484
Athonia School was founded in 1754 by Evgenius Bulgaris, a famous scholar of his time.

17:16.021 --> 17:25.237
And his successor, it was familiar to the librarian here, and so the librarian sent him a lot of books.

17:25.818 --> 17:32.149
When the school stopped its functioning, the books didn't came back.

17:32.871 --> 17:36.838
And here is another manuscript of 13th century, another gospel of 13th century.

17:37.339 --> 17:38.721
Its parchment is very thin.

17:39.308 --> 17:47.021
They say that perhaps it was made from the litter of fetus of animals, or embryos of animals, or newborn animals.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.344
647 folios.

17:49.765 --> 17:50.947
That's extraordinary.

17:50.967 --> 17:51.288
Yes.

17:51.308 --> 17:53.732
And when you close it, it's like that, like it was from paper.

17:53.992 --> 17:55.735
I've never seen that in parchment before.

17:57.017 --> 17:58.880
Here there are three Georgian manuscripts.

17:59.201 --> 18:06.092
This is one of the first manuscripts of our library, the second volume of the Old Testament.

18:06.629 --> 18:08.111
This is 10th century.

18:08.131 --> 18:21.446
10th century, written in the monastery of Otski, in 978, ordered by one of the founders, General Tornikius, who was named John, who was named John with some other manuscripts, formed our library, our first collection.

18:22.688 --> 18:26.833
It's the oldest book of our library, in our library.

18:27.433 --> 18:31.979
It's a gospel written in a Georgian monastery, Opiza, in 913.

18:31.999 --> 18:36.484
It's the second oldest Georgian dated manuscripts in the world.

18:37.510 --> 18:38.371
This here.

18:39.152 --> 18:49.445
They have a photograph of them, and show the study of them in Georgian, I see.

18:49.465 --> 19:01.601
This is an autograph by Saint Ephthymius, the second half of the monastery, and takes some of his translations into Georgian, written by his hand in 190.

19:04.725 --> 19:06.387
Agree, I agree.

19:07.025 --> 19:08.026
I'm still on this one here.

19:08.046 --> 19:13.874
But what accounts for the simpatico between the Georgians and this particular monastery?

19:13.914 --> 19:16.677
How is it that you became very close with the Georgians?

19:17.118 --> 19:26.109
I told you that in 1980 they came here and they took the monastery and they bought the monastery and some other small monasteries nearby.

19:26.630 --> 19:30.595
They enlarged it.

19:30.615 --> 19:36.542
And they had the administration of the monastery till 1356.

19:36.725 --> 19:41.372
In 1956, the administration came to the hands of the Greek monks.

19:41.392 --> 19:46.239
There were always Greek monks, but for four centuries, they were less than George.

19:46.479 --> 19:56.474
Is it safe to say that during the period of the Soviet Union that you had more information here on Georgia than there was probably available in Georgia?

19:57.074 --> 19:59.578
Ah, no, no.

19:59.598 --> 20:03.003
In the period of the Soviet Union, our abbot was the abbot of Stavronikita.

20:03.784 --> 20:05.487
We went to Georgia with a delegation.

20:05.507 --> 20:06.428
I'm minister of Georgia.

20:06.695 --> 20:12.602
of Georgia told them that if Eviron Monastery did not exist, the history of Georgia would be different.

20:13.023 --> 20:14.965
That's quite an extraordinary statement.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.708
This is the current Prime Minister who said that?

20:17.909 --> 20:19.651
No, no, in 1986.

20:19.671 --> 20:20.912
1986, alright.

20:20.932 --> 20:22.334
I don't know who was this.

20:23.135 --> 20:23.936
Art in Cunaboulos.

20:28.722 --> 20:30.224
Published in Florence in 14.

20:30.744 --> 20:32.426
It's the first edition of Homer's Iliad.

20:33.528 --> 20:35.470
Isio Princeps, that's the first.

20:36.462 --> 20:37.644
Florence, 1488.

20:38.645 --> 20:41.349
And would you say this was acquired when it was published?

20:41.929 --> 20:45.494
Has this been here since the 15th century, do you think?

20:45.514 --> 20:52.463
I think that those who were in the collection of Maximus Marvunius, who sent us pages of books in 1600.

20:52.804 --> 20:54.426
He sent you some magnificent books.

20:54.566 --> 20:56.188
Who was Maximus Marvunius?

20:56.248 --> 20:58.952
He was the most important theologian of his time.

20:59.012 --> 21:00.394
He was a bishop of Kythira.

21:00.745 --> 21:07.292
But because the Kythyra were under Venetian mode of Kythyra, so he spent his time, his life in Italy.

21:07.372 --> 21:09.614
These are some of the most beautiful books I've ever seen.

21:11.016 --> 21:14.679
Look at how well they've preserved themselves after 500 years.

21:14.699 --> 21:15.760
There's no discoloration.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.443
There's no foxing to speak of.

21:18.623 --> 21:19.044
Amazing.

21:19.484 --> 21:29.875
And this is an etymological, a lexicon, a famous lexicon, published in Venice in 1499 by Zacharias Kalijas to publish it, to print it, yes.

21:30.445 --> 21:32.027
It's exquisite.

21:32.968 --> 21:35.231
And it's considered one of the best examples of the Hippocrates.

21:35.251 --> 21:39.435
Well, most of the books, well, many of the books that Maximus gave you were printed books.

21:40.056 --> 21:40.677
Yes, yes.

21:42.399 --> 21:45.122
This is Venice, not Florence up there.

21:47.164 --> 21:59.659
And there are three liturgical manuscripts, books containing the three holy liturgies, written in the monastery in the 17th century, in 1621.

22:00.635 --> 22:05.503
And this is the initial letters, O, E. Worth-taking, really.

22:07.446 --> 22:10.391
How many incunabula did you say you have, do you think?

22:11.473 --> 22:14.718
Thirty-four.

22:14.738 --> 22:17.743
Oh, boy.

22:17.763 --> 22:18.805
This is a treasure house.

22:19.967 --> 22:23.352
Here there are two scrolls, one parchment.

22:23.635 --> 22:27.538
Written circa 1200, it contains the service of the Holy Communion.

22:27.578 --> 22:32.142
1591, by Luke the Cypriot, Bishop of Bouzeau.

22:32.162 --> 22:32.743
Bouzeau.

22:32.763 --> 22:33.263
Bouzeau.

22:33.283 --> 22:33.744
Bouzeau.

22:33.844 --> 22:34.204
Bouzeau.

22:34.284 --> 22:34.765
Bouzeau.

22:34.885 --> 22:35.345
Bouzeau.

22:35.365 --> 22:35.766
Bouzeau.

22:35.946 --> 22:36.566
Bouzeau.

22:36.586 --> 22:37.487
Bouzeau.

22:38.128 --> 22:39.048
Bouzeau.

22:39.068 --> 22:39.229
Bouzeau.

22:39.249 --> 22:39.469
Bouzeau.

22:39.589 --> 22:40.089
Bouzeau.

22:40.690 --> 22:40.970
Bouzeau.

22:40.990 --> 22:41.230
Bouzeau.

22:41.250 --> 22:41.491
Bouzeau.

22:41.511 --> 22:41.971
Bouzeau.

22:42.351 --> 22:42.632
Bouzeau.

22:42.652 --> 22:42.932
Bouzeau.

22:42.972 --> 22:43.152
Bouzeau.

22:43.172 --> 22:43.332
Bouzeau.

22:43.352 --> 22:43.552
Bouzeau.

22:43.572 --> 22:44.153
Bouzeau.

22:44.173 --> 22:44.413
Bouzeau.

22:44.473 --> 22:44.633
Bouzeau.

22:44.653 --> 22:44.813
Bouzeau.

22:44.833 --> 22:45.194
Bouzeau.

22:45.534 --> 22:45.714
Bouzeau.

22:47.736 --> 22:47.956
Bouzeau.

22:48.156 --> 22:48.316
Bouzeau.

22:48.336 --> 22:48.497
Bouzeau.

22:48.517 --> 22:48.677
Bouzeau.

22:48.697 --> 22:48.877
Bouzeau.

22:48.897 --> 22:49.217
Bouzeau.

22:49.237 --> 22:49.397
Bouzeau.

22:49.417 --> 22:49.618
Bouzeau.

22:49.758 --> 22:49.918
Bouzeau.

22:49.938 --> 22:50.118
Bouzeau.

22:50.138 --> 22:50.338
Bouzeau.

22:50.358 --> 22:50.598
Bouzeau.

22:50.618 --> 22:50.839
Bouzeau.

22:50.859 --> 22:51.039
Bouzeau.

22:51.079 --> 22:51.259
Bouzeau.

22:51.299 --> 22:51.459
Bouzeau.

22:51.479 --> 22:51.639
Bouzeau.

22:51.659 --> 22:51.820
Bouzeau.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.000
Bouzeau.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.461
Bouzeau.

22:53.481 --> 22:53.541
Bou

22:53.858 --> 23:01.127
Turkish soldiers invaded Peloponnes with Ibrahim from Egypt.

23:02.069 --> 23:06.214
The precious things were sold in order to buy weapons.

23:07.115 --> 23:12.402
And there is a list of our, of the precious things from Thessaloniki.

23:12.422 --> 23:14.865
Three from Thessaloniki, one from Yann and two from others.

23:14.885 --> 23:20.072
Here, you see, most of those books are coming from Maximus Margonius.

23:20.092 --> 23:22.415
The books have always been very precious here, haven't they?

23:22.435 --> 23:22.515
Yes.

23:24.470 --> 23:28.574
The library moved here in 1967.

23:29.315 --> 23:31.317
They were about 30 years old.

23:32.839 --> 23:35.622
I've never seen these slats before.

23:35.642 --> 23:36.543
They're very interesting.

23:38.525 --> 23:39.025
Excellent.

23:42.409 --> 23:43.009
Once more, please.

23:43.030 --> 23:43.370
What is it?

23:43.490 --> 23:44.331
Medicine for soul.

23:44.351 --> 23:50.537
Is that from the entrance to the Ramesses tomb?

23:50.778 --> 23:51.118
Yes.

23:52.246 --> 23:54.950
Yes, that's famous.

23:55.450 --> 24:03.001
I think it was Diodorus of Sicily who wrote when he was going to see this tomb.

24:03.021 --> 24:06.645
It says, medicine for the soul, balm for the soul.

24:07.366 --> 24:11.252
I went there.

24:11.332 --> 24:11.832
It's at St.

24:11.853 --> 24:12.133
Gau.

24:13.735 --> 24:15.117
It's right outside the door.

24:15.137 --> 24:18.902
I visited the St.

24:18.942 --> 24:21.105
Gau last year at this time.
