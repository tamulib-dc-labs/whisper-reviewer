00:02.258 --> 00:12.173
Okay, well, it is an interesting oeuvre you've put together thus far.

00:12.274 --> 00:13.716
How old are you now, Joanna?

00:13.936 --> 00:14.457
I'm 35.

00:14.477 --> 00:18.443
35, and what, three or four novels on a collection of stories?

00:20.166 --> 00:20.306
Uh-huh.

00:20.326 --> 00:22.890
And do you see it as a body of work?

00:24.212 --> 00:30.662
I suppose that it's hard to tell where I am in my career, you know.

00:31.047 --> 00:35.215
If I, God forbid, something happens tomorrow, this is it, right?

00:35.555 --> 00:37.940
I have five books to my name.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.528
Or this is just the beginning of my career, you know, if I go on, plug on for 40 years.

00:42.648 --> 00:43.750
So I don't know.

00:44.512 --> 00:50.102
For me, the last three books I've tried to...

00:50.470 --> 00:54.056
shake off the earlier book for one reason or another.

00:54.076 --> 00:55.078
Let me explain this.

00:55.198 --> 00:57.743
That's interesting, by the way.

00:58.023 --> 01:03.453
There was a certain structure there that I found very seductive, a kind of fragmented structure.

01:04.154 --> 01:11.787
And after I finished it, I kept trying to write something new and using that same structure and essentially writing the same book.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.481
And I couldn't do that.

01:13.661 --> 01:19.268
I was stuck for a while with that structure and finally had to throw it off and do something new.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.870
When you say the same book, you are talking structure.

01:21.971 --> 01:28.358
Yes, this narrative structure, the fragment, the fragmented narrative, skipping around through time.

01:29.699 --> 01:39.630
So in order to try something new, I started to work on short stories and attempted to develop a more

01:40.032 --> 01:42.054
supple narrative form.

01:42.675 --> 01:53.486
Sometimes I would write a continuous narrative, sometimes a fragmented narrative, sometimes a chronological narrative, sometimes a narrative that's all over the board.

01:54.127 --> 01:56.009
So that freed me up a bit.

01:57.070 --> 02:08.082
But then after the stories, I felt like I wanted to do some sort of extended imaginative work.

02:08.483 --> 02:10.985
was feeling frustrated by the brevity of the stories.

02:11.986 --> 02:16.551
I kept, you know, with stories, you begin them, and then the next thing you know, they're over.

02:17.432 --> 02:20.955
Pardon me, but did you write them with the idea of a collection in mind?

02:20.995 --> 02:22.296
They were published around.

02:22.356 --> 02:24.218
Yeah, I didn't.

02:24.378 --> 02:31.645
The first four or five stories, for me, they felt like I was just biding time.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.308
They were exercises, do you think?

02:34.328 --> 02:35.088
Yeah, exactly.

02:35.108 --> 02:36.870
I didn't think I was putting a collection together.

02:37.137 --> 02:51.213
And then I started to sense a kind of thematic unity there and set out to, for the next story, set out to write stories that would be appropriate, that would fit into that governing idea.

02:51.253 --> 03:01.925
And then, so after the stories, I began work on this novel that, for me, feels very contained.

03:02.065 --> 03:04.107
I contained it in a setting, in a place,

03:04.677 --> 03:06.199
and in a period of time.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.303
You had the premise right off the bat?

03:08.323 --> 03:12.289
I mean, you started with this... We're talking about the new novel right now.

03:12.309 --> 03:12.970
Yeah, The Mannequin.

03:13.010 --> 03:16.115
The Mannequin, right.

03:16.135 --> 03:17.397
What did I start with?

03:17.417 --> 03:19.460
Right, I mean, did you have the premise when you started?

03:19.500 --> 03:32.440
You said you had a... I had an image of the house, really, that I wanted to set a fiction, set an entire novel within a house, or within a house in its...

03:33.297 --> 03:37.102
surrounding landscape and not move from that.

03:37.403 --> 03:41.709
And so that was the kind of challenge I set to myself as a writer.

03:42.129 --> 03:44.413
I mean, did you see the Gothic element here?

03:47.156 --> 03:48.318
No, I don't think so.

03:48.358 --> 03:52.504
And I'm not quite sure if this word Gothic is thrown around a bit.

03:52.784 --> 03:54.747
I know, I'm just saying what other people are saying.

03:54.807 --> 03:56.489
Reviews have been used against me.

03:56.730 --> 04:01.937
Even in a good review, they'll call me a Gothic writer and suddenly I'm a genre writer now.

04:02.812 --> 04:04.975
Yeah, each was incredible this morning.

04:05.376 --> 04:06.738
You know what I got?

04:06.758 --> 04:08.761
I was reviewed with a couple of romance writers.

04:08.781 --> 04:09.502
Oh, it's a gothic.

04:09.522 --> 04:10.284
Isn't it terrible?

04:12.147 --> 04:12.367
Yeah.

04:13.729 --> 04:19.618
The irony here is that there's a romance writer who uses the name Joanna Scott, and people are forever missing out.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.281
You don't need that.

04:22.322 --> 04:23.504
I'm sorry, go ahead.

04:23.705 --> 04:28.532
Anyway, I think just by taking...

04:29.390 --> 04:35.381
derapidated mansion and setting it on a remote estate, suddenly you have the elements of a gothic novel.

04:36.584 --> 04:38.006
I didn't intend that.

04:38.067 --> 04:43.517
It just seems more of a coincidence that I...

04:43.733 --> 04:46.477
The adjective applies here.

04:46.497 --> 04:52.927
Now, at what point does the idea of taxidermy and fossils and all this stuff come in?

04:54.389 --> 04:59.277
Well, I have to explain how I started the book, really, to explain that.

04:59.978 --> 05:06.568
I was on a snowy day here in Rochester.

05:06.903 --> 05:11.309
I happened to look out the window and saw a deer standing in the neighbor's yard.

05:11.349 --> 05:12.891
It was a few yards down, actually.

05:12.951 --> 05:14.613
So there was about 100 yards distance.

05:15.815 --> 05:21.182
And this was surprising to me because we live in the city and are surrounded by some major roads.

05:21.282 --> 05:25.667
So I didn't think... I couldn't see how the deer had traveled so far.

05:26.849 --> 05:29.432
Anyway, I looked at... Or how it was likely to survive.

05:29.753 --> 05:34.799
Yeah, and there was no source of natural water around.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.201
So...

05:37.244 --> 05:39.309
It didn't move, and it didn't move, and it didn't move.

05:39.329 --> 05:43.438
And I went outside, and I threw a snowball at it, and it still didn't move.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.746
And then I climbed over the fence and started pushing, and it still didn't move.

05:46.766 --> 05:55.506
And as I got nearer, I realized it was a stuffed deer, a full-size taxiderm deer that the neighbors had set out as a lawn ornament.

05:55.486 --> 05:58.050
You know, not any of this plastic stuff.

05:59.032 --> 06:00.053
That's a funny story.

06:00.073 --> 06:01.856
That's a funny story.

06:02.116 --> 06:09.909
And then I went back into the house and was so intrigued by this idea of taxidermy that I looked it up in the image.

06:09.929 --> 06:11.090
You mean just from that, right there?

06:11.311 --> 06:12.012
Right, yeah.

06:12.032 --> 06:17.661
Taxidermy, this happens, we'll get to this, but this happens, it seems, all the time to you, doesn't it?

06:17.681 --> 06:20.124
You see something like this and you say, oh, taxidermy.

06:20.826 --> 06:20.946
Right.

06:20.966 --> 06:21.747
I mean, obviously.

06:23.482 --> 06:26.986
Some people might think venison steaks or whatever.

06:27.006 --> 06:29.008
Right, right.

06:29.389 --> 06:36.176
It turns out that this area, Rochester, New York, was a center for taxidermy at the turn of the century.

06:36.697 --> 06:36.997
Wow.

06:37.217 --> 06:45.346
And there was the name Rochester, New York, in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and of course I felt very proud of that, right?

06:46.307 --> 06:48.730
And I started to read about

06:49.452 --> 07:04.182
This company called Ward's Science Establishment that was up here during the early years of the century was a thriving supply company for natural history museums.

07:04.262 --> 07:08.811
It still exists, but natural history museums aren't available.

07:09.382 --> 07:12.685
are looking elsewhere, you know, for their displays.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.447
They're not doing these intimate dioramas.

07:14.507 --> 07:23.677
Much to the chagrin of Stephen Jay Gould, who thinks that, I did a recent interview with him, that museums should be museums and theme parks should be theme parks.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.240
Yeah, well, I feel that a little bit, too, as I go to these museums and see.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.662
They're not making new dioramas.

07:28.762 --> 07:38.232
They're doing these computer... Yeah, hands-on, whiz-bang things, making bigger bookstores, selling more T-shirts and cups, you know, that kind of stuff.

07:38.252 --> 07:38.612
Right, right.

07:38.592 --> 07:47.927
And I think the dioramas, the best ones are found at, say, the Field Museum or the American Museum in New York.

07:48.028 --> 07:53.917
And they were all created by people who were associated with this ward's science establishment.

07:53.937 --> 07:54.278
Oh, really?

07:54.298 --> 07:55.099
Sure.

07:55.199 --> 08:03.553
And often the elements of the diorama were put together up here.

08:04.597 --> 08:08.542
So that was, so you found just, you talk about serendipity.

08:08.963 --> 08:09.163
Yeah.

08:09.183 --> 08:11.506
First of all, you see a stuffed deer in a neighbor's yard.

08:11.967 --> 08:12.247
Yeah.

08:12.268 --> 08:18.376
And then you say, gee, look up, and then lo and behold, the city that you're in was a mecca for taxidermy.

08:18.396 --> 08:19.157
For taxidermy, exactly.

08:19.177 --> 08:19.938
It's amazing, yeah.

08:20.238 --> 08:27.328
And that got me thinking about the metaphor of taxidermy.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.132
And what is the metaphor for you?

08:30.685 --> 08:35.429
Well, I think... Stuffing things, preserving things, appearance, reality, I wonder.

08:35.569 --> 08:39.513
Well, it has something to do with what I'm trying to do as a writer.

08:39.673 --> 08:45.718
You take things, you take words, and you try to create some lifelike scene.

08:46.839 --> 08:53.184
For the taxidermist, he has to take something dead and make it lifelike.

08:53.745 --> 08:59.950
And that transformation of a corpse, essentially, or a skin, a hide,

09:00.402 --> 09:10.531
into art seemed ripe for me as I tried to think about the nature of fiction and the nature of realism.

09:11.532 --> 09:15.977
Also the sense that I had been tricked as I looked at the deer.

09:15.997 --> 09:19.440
I loved that feeling, the deception of it.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.282
I thought it was alive, but it wasn't.

09:21.782 --> 09:28.148
When you're reading a book, you can just fall into it and think, for a second,

09:28.398 --> 09:57.915
forgets that you're reading or even writing for a second I can forget that I'm writing I'm so absorbed by the dream of it and that's it seems to me a similar deception this happens to you obviously I mean this is part of your creative process oh yeah yeah I love it that forgetfulness that trick that hallucination really and so it's in a it's almost a

09:58.587 --> 10:01.871
well, I don't want to say tangential metaphor in the book.

10:02.693 --> 10:15.430
I guess it's a kind of binding metaphor, but it's one that I come to only occasionally in the book.

10:15.450 --> 10:16.291
Do you know what I mean?

10:16.712 --> 10:18.454
Basically, I'm concerned with the characters.

10:18.474 --> 10:23.221
Yeah, I mean, it's not a heavy-handed metaphor, but it's there.

10:23.341 --> 10:27.126
Here and there, I kind of step back and consider what it means to...

10:27.747 --> 10:31.791
I try to create a fiction.

10:32.011 --> 10:33.893
Well, we do see this in a lot of your work.

10:33.954 --> 10:42.282
I mean, the microscope comes immediately to mind as a kind of metaphor for similar kinds of things, I think.

10:42.302 --> 10:43.504
Remember going back to your stories?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.966
Yeah, yeah.

10:46.367 --> 10:52.573
I guess it's no coincidence that I began that collection with the microscope.

10:53.144 --> 10:58.071
You certainly are looking for a strong metaphor in just about everything that you write, though.

10:58.211 --> 10:59.853
Is that a fair statement?

10:59.873 --> 11:01.756
I think so, yeah.

11:02.196 --> 11:08.665
It helps me to organize my chaotic thoughts to give me a focus.

11:09.085 --> 11:15.634
And at what point did you see this as a driving metaphor?

11:17.417 --> 11:20.120
Did you have this idea before you had your characters?

11:20.160 --> 11:20.701
Let's ask that.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.864
I did have the idea before I...

11:23.047 --> 11:27.211
Well, I had the idea, I was still thinking about this big house in the country.

11:27.511 --> 11:29.133
I had that first.

11:29.173 --> 11:31.215
Which is a metaphor in its own way too, isn't it?

11:31.235 --> 11:32.256
Or a setting, yeah.

11:32.697 --> 11:36.981
I wasn't thinking of it so much as a metaphor at that point and became more of a metaphor.

11:37.001 --> 11:52.176
So I had my setting and then I had the deer and then the day I saw the deer I happened to go to Skidmore College to give a reading and was talking to the writers Stephen Milhauser and Catherine Davis about it and we were

11:52.578 --> 12:08.089
laughing, I don't know if you know Stephen Miller, how you do it, but he fills his work with museums and layers upon layers of...

12:10.128 --> 12:11.530
It sounds like I'd love it.

12:11.550 --> 12:13.093
I'd love anything about museums.

12:13.353 --> 12:15.116
Oh, you would.

12:15.237 --> 12:16.318
I mean, look at my book.

12:16.378 --> 12:18.462
I mean, it's just... Oh, of course you would.

12:18.482 --> 12:21.026
I mean, you're a book tour, it occurs to me.

12:21.046 --> 12:22.208
You probably already know that.

12:22.549 --> 12:23.851
No, that's not the point.

12:23.871 --> 12:28.759
I mean, it's just I am fascinated by museums and collections of things.

12:28.839 --> 12:34.088
Anyway... How do you spell his name, Milhouse?

12:34.108 --> 12:35.190
Not like Nixon.

12:35.170 --> 12:35.811
Pardon me?

12:35.911 --> 12:37.534
How do you spell Milhouse?

12:37.554 --> 12:38.014
Milhauser.

12:38.495 --> 12:39.737
Oh, I'm sorry, Milhauser.

12:39.757 --> 12:39.997
Yeah.

12:40.117 --> 12:41.139
How do you spell it?

12:41.159 --> 12:43.663
M-I-L-L-H-U-S-E-R.

12:44.143 --> 12:45.205
Okay, good.

12:45.225 --> 12:46.647
I'll try to check it out.

12:46.667 --> 12:47.729
Go ahead.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.954
Actually, I think there's only one L in it.

12:50.974 --> 12:51.775
Okay, well, I'll find it.

12:51.795 --> 12:52.596
It's close enough.

12:53.097 --> 13:03.152
So, he leaned back and said, imagine, we were talking about taxidermy and laughing, thinking about writing a book about taxidermy or some mad taxidermist, and he said,

13:03.402 --> 13:06.687
imagine 50 pages on stuffing an owl.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.209
And I said, well, let's do it.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.311
Let's all write it.

13:10.092 --> 13:16.061
So we all vowed to go off and write a book about stuffing owls.

13:16.602 --> 13:17.824
And I seem to be the only one.

13:18.705 --> 13:19.366
I'm waiting.

13:19.386 --> 13:21.009
They probably forgot about it when I got home.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.193
So at that point, I had my house.

13:24.494 --> 13:25.275
I had my...

13:25.812 --> 13:28.156
And I had my owl.

13:28.636 --> 13:30.559
And you do start with your owl.

13:30.820 --> 13:31.661
Yeah, yeah.

13:31.681 --> 13:34.245
You almost give her just a little too many human thoughts, though.

13:34.305 --> 13:35.327
Yeah.

13:35.627 --> 13:41.156
Well, it was my first animal incarnation.

13:41.256 --> 13:45.122
I'm teasing here, but I mean, how else can you verbalize it, you know?

13:45.602 --> 13:47.866
Well, you can without doing that.

13:48.006 --> 13:51.732
I've played with animal stories a little bit since then.

13:52.052 --> 13:53.895
I'm kind of intrigued by that.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.357
The possibilities.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.502
But I mean, people who think they don't think are fools.

13:58.562 --> 13:59.703
Yeah, yeah.

13:59.784 --> 14:01.786
The expressiveness of an animal.

14:01.806 --> 14:03.148
It's very mysterious.

14:03.168 --> 14:04.631
I mean, we've got a Labrador retriever.

14:04.651 --> 14:08.616
You can't tell me that she's not happy when she's happy.

14:08.636 --> 14:10.980
Yeah, and there's that book, A Hidden Life of Dogs.

14:11.921 --> 14:13.543
Yeah, that's right.

14:13.563 --> 14:14.605
Is that the new one now?

14:14.625 --> 14:18.290
There's another one now about the psychology of dogs.

14:18.451 --> 14:19.071
It's crazy.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.153
Oh, no, I don't know.

14:20.302 --> 14:20.883
Go ahead.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.143
I'm sorry.

14:21.163 --> 14:22.125
I keep interrupting.

14:22.285 --> 14:38.930
Anyway, so at that point, once I had the house, taxidermy, and the owl, I could start writing and began that scene with the owl and brought it to the landscape where it's going to set the fiction and then let it go.

14:39.191 --> 14:43.016
And then at what point do the voices start to resonate?

14:43.157 --> 14:47.423
Well, I knew that in a big house I had to throw it with servants.

14:47.673 --> 14:56.708
the first half of the century, domestic service was one of the main sources of employment.

14:57.570 --> 15:02.718
And so this house, naturally, would have to have servants to maintain it.

15:03.540 --> 15:13.917
And so the servants started to acquire voices, as I wrote on in the novel.

15:15.044 --> 15:26.935
But you do have, I've read, I read there was some piece about you, I thought it was pretty good, actually, about, you know, where these voices, and of course there is a striking variety of voices in your work.

15:27.716 --> 15:31.360
In fact, somebody has compared you with Poe and Hawthorne.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.341
Have you seen that?

15:32.921 --> 15:33.041
Yeah.

15:33.362 --> 15:34.763
And Isaac Dennison as well.

15:34.783 --> 15:36.124
That was the Globe piece, I think.

15:37.726 --> 15:44.292
One review that turned out to be a good review, but it was a tiny thing, that I,

15:45.200 --> 15:48.444
compliments our book reviewers' bread and butter.

15:48.464 --> 15:51.767
We accept them and ignore them.

15:51.787 --> 15:55.191
And then the reviewer went on to say, Joanna Scott has been compared to Nathaniel Hawthorne.

15:55.211 --> 15:57.193
And the best line was, Joanna who?

15:58.194 --> 15:59.516
Joanna Scott has been compared to Hawthorne.

15:59.536 --> 16:00.076
Joanna who?

16:00.337 --> 16:01.418
That's cute.

16:01.458 --> 16:04.081
Well, I mean, that is kind of heady.

16:04.141 --> 16:06.303
And you're not asking for the comparison either.

16:06.323 --> 16:07.004
I know, I know.

16:07.324 --> 16:08.486
I kind of like that, actually.

16:08.506 --> 16:09.607
Joanna who?

16:09.787 --> 16:11.629
That sort of sums up the response to the song.

16:13.027 --> 16:18.601
Mishiko gave you a wonderful review last year on the stories.

16:18.681 --> 16:20.947
Yeah, she did the last two books.

16:20.967 --> 16:21.909
Did she do this book too?

16:22.150 --> 16:22.831
No, no.

16:22.891 --> 16:23.292
I don't know.

16:23.332 --> 16:25.337
Did she do three books in a row?

16:25.357 --> 16:25.578
Sure.

16:25.598 --> 16:27.222
They seem to do...

16:28.180 --> 16:29.963
They do seem to keep coming back.

16:30.043 --> 16:33.688
I mean, it seems to me they have their favorites, but you don't want Chris to do it.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.070
He's so damn lazy.

16:35.090 --> 16:35.611
Oh, I know.

16:35.651 --> 16:36.652
He did my first book.

16:37.734 --> 16:38.715
Indifferently, right?

16:38.755 --> 16:39.356
I'll bet.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.441
I've never seen such a wishy-washy reviewer.

16:42.601 --> 16:46.867
I mean, he starts with, well, it's this and that.

16:46.887 --> 16:48.349
And then he winds up saying it's wonderful.

16:48.530 --> 16:49.932
I mean, well, make up your mind.

16:49.992 --> 16:51.454
Is this in your book?

16:51.687 --> 16:52.468
No, he didn't.

16:52.989 --> 16:55.433
Allens predicted he wouldn't because it was too long.

16:55.733 --> 16:59.619
He said he doesn't read that much anymore.

16:59.639 --> 17:10.455
I thought he would because his father is in the, Helmut Lehmannhoft is, you know, was a major, major bibliographer and I've got his, about three of his books in the bibliography.

17:10.435 --> 17:11.757
Oh, huh.

17:11.777 --> 17:13.479
It would have been appropriate, yeah.

17:14.200 --> 17:22.092
Not that that meant that that wouldn't have been any kind of a conflict, but I just thought that the interest would be there, at least reading part of it.

17:22.853 --> 17:24.876
But it got totally ignored in the daily times.

17:25.276 --> 17:28.861
Yeah, well, I haven't even had a Sunday talk to you yet.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.883
Yeah, what was your pub date?

17:30.744 --> 17:32.506
Oh, February, beginning of February.

17:32.687 --> 17:34.589
You know, it's early yet.

17:34.609 --> 17:35.130
It's early yet.

17:35.451 --> 17:35.751
Yeah.

17:36.608 --> 17:39.571
We know there's one scheduled.

17:39.772 --> 17:40.552
For the TBR?

17:40.933 --> 17:44.457
Yeah, which means, you know, it's probably another attack.

17:44.897 --> 17:45.958
Well, when is it scheduled?

17:46.419 --> 17:46.940
We don't know.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.343
What can you say?

17:50.463 --> 17:51.925
How do you know it's scheduled?

17:52.025 --> 17:54.708
Alan somehow found out, and Ruth did.

17:54.968 --> 17:55.729
Ruth's wonderful.

17:55.749 --> 17:57.111
She's great, yeah.

17:57.271 --> 17:58.392
She's outstanding.

17:59.654 --> 18:02.877
We've been working on my book now since July, you know.

18:03.238 --> 18:06.261
And, of course, we talk about

18:06.815 --> 18:35.944
authors like this so it's two hats we change hats yeah and talk about this i'm sorry we got off the track there it seems to me you do a lot of research though um you don't seem to be intimidated by taking on our keen subjects you're right you're right i'm not intimidated and i'm whenever i finish a book i kind of look at it and say wow i can't believe i i took on something that's strange and nobody called you on it either right exactly i'm always ready for that and in fact

18:36.160 --> 18:36.982
No one has.

18:37.823 --> 18:47.542
With Egon Shira, I seem to get away with... No one called me on it, as you said.

18:48.444 --> 18:51.390
I seem to fool them.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.233
I don't want to put that into it.

18:53.353 --> 18:54.736
No, I won't worry about it.

18:55.958 --> 18:58.303
In a way, I'm amazed at my...

18:58.874 --> 19:04.042
boldness with that book in particular that I took on this artist and this culture.

19:04.303 --> 19:05.345
An actual figure.

19:05.605 --> 19:06.727
Yeah, I didn't know.

19:06.767 --> 19:11.855
And then with the stories, I had to do, my research was limited.

19:11.895 --> 19:15.101
I always feel like I'm never doing enough research, you know?

19:15.121 --> 19:18.286
I'm never, I'm not exactly an historical novelist.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.510
I'm not trying to be authentic exactly.

19:21.571 --> 19:25.658
And so I always feel guilty.

19:26.009 --> 19:31.976
When I take on these historical subjects or these scientific subjects, I feel that I'm no expert here.

19:32.277 --> 19:42.109
But that's part of my impulse, too, to take on a subject that is somehow reserved for experts, reserved for professionals, and to make it my own.

19:42.149 --> 19:52.001
And with this one, taking on the subject of natural history and taxidermy, a funny thing happened just a few days ago.

19:52.021 --> 19:54.784
I was giving a signing here in town at Borders.

19:55.169 --> 20:06.462
And there was a woman in the crowd who came up to me, waited until everybody else had gone, and she came up to me afterwards and introduced herself as the daughter of the local taxidermist in town.

20:06.982 --> 20:10.728
And this can go either way, when they come up, right?

20:10.748 --> 20:25.951
No, I was scared he was going to sue me, because I had visited this man, and without telling him what I was doing, I had asked him lots of questions, and he had shown me around his studio, and I had used a lot of the information that he gave me in the book.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.415
I don't see anything wrong with that.

20:28.655 --> 20:31.960
No, no, but then I had this character, Bajo, who's...

20:32.210 --> 20:34.335
Kind of like the guy that showed you.

20:34.415 --> 20:35.919
Not exactly.

20:35.939 --> 20:39.668
Has some of the same aesthetic values.

20:40.670 --> 20:46.725
And I waited with bated breath there for her to...

20:47.330 --> 20:49.092
give me a summons or something.

20:49.493 --> 20:52.256
But instead she said, oh, my family loves the book.

20:52.457 --> 20:57.863
And they have a saying now in the family, whenever anybody wants to get out of the house, they say they're going over to Bajos.

20:59.866 --> 21:00.407
That's cute.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.389
So luckily I got away with it.

21:03.130 --> 21:11.701
But when you do write about a historical figure, do you feel any kind of responsibility to the record?

21:12.222 --> 21:14.785
I feel a mixed responsibility.

21:14.805 --> 21:16.527
I have to say I feel ambivalence.

21:16.844 --> 21:24.376
Because I don't want to trust history that much.

21:24.496 --> 21:30.926
I don't want to believe that history is completely honest.

21:31.728 --> 21:43.847
And so that makes me feel that as a fiction writer, I can take bits of it and mix it with... I imagine...

21:44.603 --> 21:56.714
bits, mix it with fiction, mix history with fiction and change it without being, I don't know, I don't feel that I'm being transgressive exactly.

21:56.734 --> 22:05.362
I just feel that I'm skeptical, I suppose, of historical narrative.

22:05.422 --> 22:14.070
As much as I love it, I want to blend, I want to blend fiction and history rather than

22:14.320 --> 22:17.904
simply recreate history with some sort of costume drama fiction.

22:18.846 --> 22:23.211
But it's really, you use it more or less to kind of stir the muse in any case.

22:23.231 --> 22:27.196
I mean, the imagination is the principal element, I gather.

22:27.316 --> 22:28.418
Yeah, it is.

22:28.518 --> 22:38.370
And from the start, people have said, oh, you always, well, when are you going to write about yourself, your own experiences?

22:38.688 --> 22:39.870
Yeah, you haven't done that, have you?

22:40.010 --> 22:42.494
Well, I feel like I always am, too.

22:42.514 --> 22:44.697
But it's hidden, and that's the way I prefer it.

22:44.878 --> 22:46.981
I prefer to be hidden.

22:48.663 --> 22:54.072
Eventually, once I'm confident enough, I'm going to start publishing anonymously, I think.

22:54.152 --> 22:55.434
Maybe with the next book.

22:55.454 --> 22:56.776
You think you do that?

22:56.936 --> 22:59.661
Doris Lessing did that.

22:59.841 --> 23:00.602
Yeah, yeah.

23:00.642 --> 23:02.605
But when she did it, she was Doris Lessing, too.

23:02.625 --> 23:03.847
Right, right, exactly.

23:06.411 --> 23:07.092
But I...

23:07.763 --> 23:09.712
I... What's the thing now?

23:10.138 --> 23:10.483
Um...

23:11.138 --> 23:15.442
Well, I guess you hit the hidden self in the fiction, I guess.

23:15.602 --> 23:19.526
So where could people who know you find you in your work?

23:19.546 --> 23:22.109
Well, that's a secret.

23:22.549 --> 23:26.433
Let me tell you, when I do these, I'm always looking for my lead.

23:26.593 --> 23:28.535
I'm always looking for my kicker.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.077
You just gave me my kicker.

23:31.157 --> 23:31.678
Oh, good.

23:32.319 --> 23:32.499
Okay.

23:32.639 --> 23:36.022
Well, they can find me everywhere and nowhere.

23:36.042 --> 23:36.543
That's great.

23:36.563 --> 23:37.263
That's wonderful.

23:38.004 --> 23:41.027
This isn't hard, I told you.

23:41.935 --> 23:42.978
Okay.

23:43.499 --> 23:44.502
Good talk if you want.

23:44.663 --> 23:46.488
I'm thinking here.

23:47.310 --> 23:49.917
I'll let you lead me.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.625
You're a Connecticut woman, I gather?

23:53.146 --> 23:53.768
From where?

23:54.102 --> 24:21.004
from uh uh darien okay i have two newspapers in connecticut that's why i mentioned it okay where where uh new london takes me every week and manchester takes me which is nice because it's where yukon is and i i really i'm in a lot of university towns a lot of southern towns i just uh crazily i got roanoke yesterday which is in the woods you know in the mountains

24:21.119 --> 24:29.755
But I'm in Charlottesville every week and I'm in Knoxville and Gainesville and Eugene, Oregon and Salt Lake City and Boston.

24:29.795 --> 24:32.640
So, you know, we're universities, which is nice.

24:32.660 --> 24:32.760
Yeah.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.125
Where people read what you want hopes.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.571
And I think that, you know, you're the kind of...

24:38.872 --> 24:40.654
author, a literary author.

24:40.694 --> 24:41.135
Right.

24:42.857 --> 24:45.621
I've got a couple of papers down in New Jersey that I mentioned to you.

24:46.843 --> 24:48.084
Who is the person down in New Jersey again?

24:48.104 --> 24:59.179
A woman by the name of Karen Fisk, F-I-S-K, and she apparently said she, I don't know, she didn't suggest that she knows you well, but she certainly knows your work.

24:59.340 --> 25:01.262
Right, but the name's familiar.

25:01.402 --> 25:04.386
And quite anxious to get this piece, which is nice.

25:05.087 --> 25:05.588
Yeah.

25:06.142 --> 25:09.855
And, you know, the good news is I'm red where people read books.

25:10.036 --> 25:11.702
That's how I go about selling the column.

25:11.902 --> 25:17.502
I mean, I find communities where they are.

25:18.055 --> 25:21.761
There's a demonstrated market for books.

25:21.801 --> 25:25.226
If I look at the ABA sales figures and where the books sell them.

25:25.266 --> 25:26.428
Oh, that's interesting.

25:26.468 --> 25:28.912
You know what Good Paper is, that news day?

25:29.012 --> 25:30.214
There's Sunday book sections.

25:30.594 --> 25:32.337
Yeah, well, they've got a full-time staff.

25:33.258 --> 25:36.063
Sometimes I can... It's a fine line.

25:36.083 --> 25:39.849
I mean, I can't go to a place like the Globe or the... I see.

25:39.869 --> 25:42.493
Because they've got three people, you know.

25:42.593 --> 25:42.713
Right.

25:42.693 --> 25:50.364
So what I'm going to do is find these nice, like I'm in Toledo every week, I'm in Columbus, which is really, you know, Ohio State, you know.

25:51.386 --> 25:55.051
Austin, which is supposedly the best book city in America, Austin, Texas.

25:56.553 --> 26:00.058
They sell more per capita, per household, and per bookstore down there.

26:00.759 --> 26:04.925
But all it is is a state capital in the University of Texas, so you would expect that.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.050
Anyway, we don't need to go in and tell all that.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.253
So what are you working on now?

26:10.756 --> 26:19.104
I'm working on stories again, partly because I have a small child who only gives me little pockets of time.

26:20.526 --> 26:26.532
So I've actually moved up from the 1920s to the 1930s, and I'm slowly approaching.

26:27.192 --> 26:31.336
Is it kind of a chronological thing?

26:31.356 --> 26:32.437
Has it been?

26:32.958 --> 26:33.618
Well, I did.

26:33.719 --> 26:37.202
In my last book of stories, I...

26:37.418 --> 27:00.827
arranged them chronologically and ended with something a story set in the 70s so that's as close as i've gotten really to a contemporary that is interesting for a woman 35 um and i could see why people would ask you you haven't written about yourself or you know by extension your your time yeah oh i know i'm i'm i find this time

27:01.195 --> 27:02.256
Utterly baffling.

27:02.557 --> 27:17.456
And so as long as there's written material to organize my thoughts about the past, that helps me to create a fiction.

27:18.277 --> 27:22.883
And I have tried to write a more contemporary piece.

27:23.343 --> 27:24.264
It doesn't work?

27:24.585 --> 27:25.426
I get lost.

27:26.547 --> 27:27.328
Well, what is it?

27:27.368 --> 27:29.731
What do you suppose makes that happen?

27:29.751 --> 27:31.033
Well, there just seems to be...

27:31.402 --> 27:35.148
So much, so much, I guess, so much.

27:35.168 --> 27:36.910
I look out the window.

27:36.930 --> 27:38.092
I pick up a newspaper.

27:38.172 --> 27:43.080
I feel like I'm inundated with possibilities.

27:43.540 --> 27:47.666
Well, when I'm writing out of history, those possibilities are limited.

27:49.089 --> 27:57.101
Perhaps it's the visual element of contemporary life.

27:57.321 --> 28:00.025
There's just so much to see, and I look and see these things.

28:00.882 --> 28:03.084
these things and I don't know the names of them.

28:03.325 --> 28:12.314
I look across the neighbor's house and I don't know the name of the kind of roofing they have.

28:12.374 --> 28:18.200
I don't know the name of the color of the brick or something.

28:18.720 --> 28:27.970
And when I'm dealing with history, those names, those words are available or more readily available.

28:28.355 --> 28:29.196
Do you see what I'm saying?

28:29.456 --> 28:29.857
Yeah, I do.

28:30.157 --> 28:33.161
But you take it upon yourself to find these things out, I gather.

28:33.181 --> 28:35.044
Yeah, so that's where the research comes in.

28:36.205 --> 28:43.715
I mean, did you see yourself when you started this business as a fiction writer as a researcher as well?

28:44.837 --> 28:46.038
No, no, I didn't.

28:46.058 --> 28:46.439
I didn't.

28:46.619 --> 28:53.488
It was an experience I had with the first novel I wrote when the narrator is an old fisherman.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.472
And I knew nothing about fishing.

28:57.262 --> 29:08.835
and started to read not just fishing guides, but archaic fishing guides, these angling books written in the late 19th century.

29:08.855 --> 29:12.179
And they were so rich, so lovely.

29:12.199 --> 29:21.690
The language was just amazing in them that I thought, wow, here's a story in itself.

29:22.791 --> 29:26.796
The love of fishing is expressed in the language that was archaic,

29:27.248 --> 29:35.355
It just really intrigued me, and that's when I started to recognize, for me, the value of research.

29:35.716 --> 29:37.402
What was the attraction to fishing?

29:38.666 --> 29:39.047
I...

29:39.736 --> 29:40.918
No attraction.

29:40.978 --> 29:41.919
It was arbitrary.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.241
I took it on.

29:43.542 --> 29:46.146
I just decided I wanted something that I didn't do.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.608
I don't fish.

29:47.768 --> 29:52.215
But I mean, that's basically the story of almost all of your books, isn't it?

29:52.235 --> 29:52.996
Yeah, I guess it is.

29:53.137 --> 29:53.417
Yeah.

29:53.577 --> 29:55.500
Yeah, I want something that I don't... It's not familiar.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.463
Nothing seems to be familiar to you.

29:57.483 --> 29:58.164
Yeah, yeah.

29:58.184 --> 29:59.847
Superficially, at least.

29:59.867 --> 30:00.007
Yeah.

30:00.027 --> 30:02.511
And we... Well, we have the hidden elements.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.613
I'm writing intimately.

30:04.194 --> 30:04.294
Yeah.

30:04.314 --> 30:06.317
And this frustrates me, too, because...

30:06.533 --> 30:18.888
People, if I'm writing in the voice of a male protagonist, or if I'm writing out of a moment from the past, people automatically assume that there's some kind of detachment between me and my subject.

30:19.849 --> 30:23.913
And I don't feel that... I'm baffled by that criticism.

30:24.134 --> 30:24.774
Detachment.

30:24.855 --> 30:26.176
I don't know what that means.

30:26.937 --> 30:33.705
Because I feel intimately the emotions of these characters as I'm writing...

30:34.242 --> 30:34.684
I don't know.

30:34.704 --> 30:38.978
Is it because I'm crossing gender lines, crossing out of the contemporary world into the past?

30:39.159 --> 30:40.423
I don't understand that.

30:41.346 --> 30:46.564
It's a frustrating criticism and one that I've had over and over.

30:47.168 --> 30:50.613
I think it's great that both you and your husband teach in Rochester.

30:50.774 --> 30:52.977
It's wonderful that I can get.

30:53.358 --> 30:56.322
It's a great gig.

30:56.803 --> 31:00.970
We're both on leave this year, too, so we're kicking around the house a lot.

31:00.990 --> 31:01.210
It's fun.

31:01.270 --> 31:06.258
I work at home, which I've been doing now for six years, and it's heaven, I must say.

31:06.278 --> 31:07.800
I wish I'd started it earlier.

31:08.021 --> 31:09.463
Yeah.

31:09.612 --> 31:16.664
My wife works here, too, but we have to keep it different parts of the different ends of the house.

31:16.684 --> 31:21.172
We can't afford it the way Michael Holroyd and Margaret Drabble, they have separate houses.

31:22.374 --> 31:22.875
Oh, really?

31:22.895 --> 31:25.840
It's from London, you know.

31:25.860 --> 31:27.503
And then they get together at night.
