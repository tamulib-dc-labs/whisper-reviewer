WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:03.877
Thank you.

00:03.917 --> 00:06.820
Thank you for taking the time to talk with Isabella Mussolini.

00:07.601 --> 00:09.422
We just want to start.

00:10.063 --> 00:16.868
I guess with the title, Some of Me, tell me why it's some of you and not... All of me.

00:16.888 --> 00:21.032
Not all of you, or most of me, you know.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.674
Because it is just some of me.

00:25.135 --> 00:27.057
The book is not an autobiography.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.860
Random House calls it a memoir.

00:32.021 --> 00:32.822
But I...

00:33.089 --> 00:41.957
I think it was difficult to classify it, and that's why they call it a memoir, because it was the closest thing.

00:42.017 --> 00:59.974
But it is a mixture of memories and a mixture of reflective things on the work that I have done, some anecdotes, and some

01:00.224 --> 01:21.894
There are some things that are also a fantasy, like I have some of the directors that I've worked with or my father discuss film styling, you know, making up a conversation that never took place, but just, because I just heard individual talks to me, but I never talked to one another because they've never met.

01:22.535 --> 01:24.878
So part of the book is also fictional.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.763
It's very interesting because I, there was a,

01:29.165 --> 01:32.629
a feature on this book on Salon.

01:32.649 --> 01:33.911
Have you ever heard of that?

01:34.772 --> 01:37.615
I had just recently heard of it, but it's an online magazine.

01:38.276 --> 01:39.157
It's on print.

01:39.597 --> 01:43.843
But they had some very interesting interviews, and they identified this as a novel.

01:44.283 --> 01:52.273
And I said, this is... I couldn't understand why they... Oh, yes, because probably of the fictional part of it, which is a great deal of it.

01:53.094 --> 01:57.619
But nevertheless, it is... I guess it really defies classification, doesn't it?

01:57.835 --> 01:58.576
A little bit.

01:58.696 --> 02:00.338
You know, it was hard to define.

02:01.199 --> 02:04.103
So for random, it's a memoir.

02:04.163 --> 02:05.726
For other, it's a novel.

02:05.746 --> 02:09.891
A novel, I think, is a bit far.

02:10.111 --> 02:13.596
And also autobiography, as far as an autobiography, too.

02:13.636 --> 02:16.560
So why did you want to challenge these guidelines?

02:16.921 --> 02:19.684
Why not do a novel as a novel and do a memoir as a novel?

02:19.704 --> 02:21.747
Because probably I'm not a writer, you know.

02:21.827 --> 02:25.672
So I just wrote what was interesting to me.

02:25.832 --> 02:27.775
You know, I think a writer would probably...

02:28.210 --> 02:55.973
know how to write an autobiography or how to write a memoir or something like that, I was solicited to do a book on style or a collection of photography or an autobiography and none of it interested me because, you know, about style I didn't, I feel that there are so many books out there about style and they're hard to find something that is really serious and

02:56.358 --> 03:14.956
you know, they all seem a bit superficial, and in the autobiography there seem to be also so many, and you know, I fear that I just fall into the trap of really people wanting to know what you don't want to reveal and interfere with your life and privacy.

03:15.537 --> 03:26.027
In the book of photography, you know, I'm very proud of my work as a model, but I think the photography really belongs more to the photographer

03:26.378 --> 03:32.586
than to me, so it wasn't going to be a representative of my work, you know, it was going to be representative of their work.

03:33.508 --> 03:50.090
I think my lawyer said, but you always turn down everything that people come, not too many people have offers to do books, so think of something that you would like to do instead of just saying, no, because this is, you know, having a negative attitude.

03:50.631 --> 03:55.778
So I started to write, and I didn't know where I was going, I started to write what I thought was interesting.

03:56.180 --> 03:59.645
And that became some of me.

04:00.687 --> 04:05.735
I didn't think, let me write something that is another, you know, I just wrote what I thought was interesting.

04:05.755 --> 04:09.240
She really just started writing, and what emerged, emerged.

04:10.101 --> 04:16.632
I think really what interests, truly interests me, I mean, I do a weekly literary piece, I've been doing it for 20 years.

04:17.453 --> 04:21.519
I routinely stay away from the celebrity book, you know.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.402
My daughters can't understand how I

04:23.585 --> 04:28.911
But this one has some substance to it, if I may say so.

04:29.111 --> 04:29.792
Oh, great.

04:29.812 --> 04:33.076
I like the fact that there is an apparent paradox.

04:33.096 --> 04:50.555
Here you are, a beautiful woman, you know, and you are certainly known for your modeling and for your acting and for your glamorous parents, but yet you are giving, some of you, if not all of you, you are making an attempt, I think, to penetrate yourself and to give a piece of yourself.

04:51.236 --> 04:52.377
Well, you know,

04:52.745 --> 04:53.946
I don't know.

04:54.046 --> 05:04.196
You probably know more about literature than I. I thought it was interesting, for example, when I talk about Marty or my father or David Lynch, the director that I've worked.

05:05.517 --> 05:18.650
It was more interesting to me to do a portrait to describe how it was to work with them or to describe what was their discussion that they had in a way that it was intimate, but that it wasn't indiscreet.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.592
You know, I didn't want to discuss

05:20.926 --> 05:48.182
why we broke up, why we divorced, it also seemed to me like those are fake intimacies, you know, people think they know about people if they know those facts, but you just have a police report, you know, you don't really have, so I hope that my book is personal, in a sense that it is a close insight into these people's idea, because they have great minds, you know, and some of them are

05:48.533 --> 05:53.998
like Richard Avedon or Stephen Mizell, a chess photographer that I've worked with, so they are friends.

05:54.159 --> 06:06.971
And Avedon, I wouldn't even call a friend because it's somebody that I revered a great deal, but he might kind of a friend, but I mean, another generation and a great maestro.

06:07.492 --> 06:16.060
But I thought I was going to give, I can't truly do a full portrait of Avedon, but I can explain how he directs.

06:16.546 --> 06:17.708
in a photo session.

06:19.130 --> 06:23.056
What do you feel when you are direct, when you're photographed by him?

06:23.757 --> 06:26.982
Is it different than being photographed by another photographer?

06:27.002 --> 06:28.484
All that seemed to me interesting.

06:29.586 --> 06:39.682
The other person that helped me finding out what was interesting was Bob Gottlieb, who was my editor, because I often came to Bob and said, do you think this would be interesting?

06:39.742 --> 06:41.685
And Bob would say, yes or no.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.768
And I went a little bit

06:44.204 --> 06:55.995
You know, like the discussion about the camera movement that I have between my father and Martin and how stupefied I was.

06:56.035 --> 07:07.265
Because when I grew up, my father talked about the camera being at the eye level and the camera, that anything that the camera did that was just an enhanced human eye was trickery.

07:07.525 --> 07:09.207
It was manipulating your audience.

07:09.227 --> 07:13.030
So in a way, it was to be condemned, morally condemned.

07:13.330 --> 07:35.519
So camera movement, I grew up thinking that, you know, if a film had any elegance, he had this kind of static quality because anything else was trickery and anything that is trickery is a lack of style or a cover-up's holes or he manipulates whoever is there witnessing it.

07:36.100 --> 07:42.088
And when I went to see Marty's film, when I went to visit him on the set the first time and I saw that the camera was

07:42.440 --> 07:43.481
loved the actor.

07:43.621 --> 07:45.524
I said, what kind of eye could it be that?

07:45.544 --> 07:47.687
You know, it's only the point of view of a fly.

07:47.727 --> 07:50.510
And I became so frightened to go home.

07:50.570 --> 07:54.675
And they were going to tell me, well, what did you see today at my Halle Martin set?

07:54.755 --> 07:58.160
And I was going to say, well, the camera is where a fly is going to be.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.061
Forget the eye.

07:59.201 --> 08:00.262
I don't know what he's doing.

08:00.282 --> 08:01.504
I don't know what he's trying to do.

08:02.445 --> 08:08.132
And I was telling that to Bob as, you know, just talking about movies.

08:08.212 --> 08:09.474
And he said, that is interesting.

08:09.514 --> 08:10.895
Why don't you put that in your book?

08:10.956 --> 08:12.177
And I said, well, I thought that was

08:12.865 --> 08:38.973
It's either too complex, because you have to be a filmmaker or a film buff to know that director grow to the greatest extent of trying to figure it out, not how to film a scene, but have to have the style of their own, almost like a writer chooses word or the length of their sentences or the rhythm to the page is the same way you move the camera.

08:39.834 --> 08:41.556
So Bob was helpful that way.

08:42.616 --> 08:45.740
Talk to me about dedicating the book to your ghosts.

08:46.741 --> 08:52.007
That came at the end, because Leanda was telling me, did you write a forward page?

08:52.368 --> 08:53.749
I said, no.

08:53.849 --> 08:55.612
Did you write all these things that writers do?

08:55.672 --> 08:58.255
I felt so embarrassed.

08:58.335 --> 09:00.417
And they said, do you dedicate the book to anybody?

09:00.437 --> 09:04.402
And I said, that would sound so pretentious that I dedicate my work.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.203
I'm not a writer.

09:07.326 --> 09:11.070
And then I thought, well, maybe my ghost, so people will have a...

09:12.316 --> 09:31.362
a glimpse into that this is not an autobiography or... because the greatest fear I had before the book came out is generally people expect for people either to write an autobiography or a book on how to put together a wardrobe, you know?

09:31.943 --> 09:37.450
So I thought, well, maybe to my ghost, we'll give it an indication that there is surrealism in this.

09:38.852 --> 09:40.855
Well, and you say immediately...

09:41.155 --> 09:47.405
You thank your friends and your family for putting up, even in this book, with your lies and exaggerations.

09:47.445 --> 09:48.046
Exactly.

09:48.106 --> 09:59.785
And I say, wait, the central conundrum of this book is the author's, how do I go, the author's frank admission that she has trouble telling the truth.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.390
Maybe you could just talk about what kind of lies we're talking about.

10:03.410 --> 10:07.517
I don't think we're talking about deep moral lies.

10:07.885 --> 10:10.509
Lies and great moral consequences.

10:10.530 --> 10:11.431
I think we're talking about the book.

10:11.451 --> 10:20.186
I think I call lie my attempt to fiction, if you want, because fiction seems a word too important to apply to my book.

10:20.206 --> 10:23.031
But I think I used the fantasy conversation.

10:23.311 --> 10:31.986
Those are lies, if you want, because they didn't take place, though I do say in the book, because I'm an imaginary conversation with people who died, so they can't be here, though I wish that I had.

10:32.354 --> 10:36.220
that this conversation had happened, so since I wish it happened, I make it up.

10:36.801 --> 10:38.283
I fulfill my desires.

10:39.164 --> 10:49.821
And occasionally I lie in the book, and later on in the page, a few pages later, I confess to... Well, maybe the four Oscars is really three Oscars.

10:49.921 --> 10:50.642
Exactly.

10:50.662 --> 10:54.848
Actually, yes, that was the first lie.

10:55.149 --> 11:00.437
And then a lie about Richard Avedon being able to know what I was thinking.

11:00.738 --> 11:20.646
and then later on I confessed into the book, he didn't really know what I was thinking, but he liked a certain expression that I have, and he could tell if I was, you know, he could tell, he couldn't tell exactly what I was thinking, but he could tell that my expression changed, and he would say, change your thinking, because he didn't like what that thought gave me as a face.

11:21.247 --> 11:28.517
But in the book I lie a little bit, exaggerate, he's penetrating my mind, because I say I wanted to give you

11:29.088 --> 11:37.757
that, oh, a surprise that I have had when I was trying to just be obedient and just look right and left and he was giving me the indication.

11:38.377 --> 11:46.225
And then when I understood that he was photographing my emotion and my thought, I understood, oh, that's what I have to do as a model.

11:46.365 --> 11:48.207
I don't have to just stand there pretty.

11:48.287 --> 11:57.036
I wasn't going to be hired if I didn't think I was pretty and if they hadn't worked on me for five hours to making me the most enhanced version of me that could exist.

11:57.556 --> 12:03.685
That wasn't my responsibility to just patiently be seated and be created into this character.

12:04.186 --> 12:06.209
What I had to offer was emotions.

12:07.010 --> 12:10.435
And so when I understood that, that's what hooked me to modeling.

12:10.455 --> 12:11.837
That's what made it interesting.

12:11.877 --> 12:15.342
Otherwise, it's just an exercise of obedience.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.787
What is it about modeling that continues to fascinate you?

12:19.248 --> 12:20.309
Well, I think there's two things.

12:20.389 --> 12:23.113
First of all, I don't see it very differently than acting.

12:23.153 --> 12:24.255
I think they're very similar.

12:24.725 --> 12:42.570
And then I think what he sees fascinating to me is that without a story, without the soundtrack, without the dialogue, without another actor to react to, but in one frame, a photo that is a successful photo exudes an emotion.

12:42.590 --> 12:46.836
And to me, why does that is a great mystery.

12:47.036 --> 12:52.864
I'm fascinated with this ability that photographers have to capture something.

12:52.884 --> 12:54.006
And I think that when you do

12:54.577 --> 12:58.683
fashion and cosmetic photo, people assume that it is the beauty of the girl.

12:58.803 --> 13:03.529
I was just about to say, is the perception of beauty essential to success?

13:04.451 --> 13:22.896
I think they just use beautiful girls, but I think that what makes that photo unforgettable is the emotion that there is in the photo, because you can see a lot of photos that are of beautiful girls, the calendar, the kind of photos that you see that are beautiful, their bodies are beautiful, their faces are beautiful, and yet

13:23.365 --> 13:25.408
You look, you say, wow, and then you forget them.

13:25.488 --> 13:26.510
You totally forget them.

13:26.530 --> 13:26.970
Exactly.

13:26.990 --> 13:32.278
You know, but what Avedon does, I think, he photographs beyond that beauty.

13:33.059 --> 13:35.162
You know, he photographs an emotion.

13:35.222 --> 13:38.707
And he makes a work of art out of it.

13:38.727 --> 13:41.091
It's not merely something that sells a product.

13:41.111 --> 13:41.792
Absolutely.

13:42.092 --> 13:43.114
You know, absolutely.

13:43.154 --> 13:47.741
And it seems to me that your former employers at Lancôme didn't understand that, did they?

13:47.761 --> 13:49.223
They didn't appreciate it.

13:49.984 --> 13:52.748
Well, I think they did appreciate it, at least until, you know,

13:53.200 --> 14:00.168
I think they did appreciate it, and there was a great debate at Lancôme of why we had been so successful.

14:00.188 --> 14:05.715
It surprised both of us that the campaign was very successful.

14:06.516 --> 14:20.592
And I think that the campaign was successful because even if some photos were a little bit more remote than others, on the overall, the campaign had feelings, had a warmth.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.128
that generally cosmetic campaigns don't have.

14:24.148 --> 14:28.294
And I think that's what made it very successful.

14:28.394 --> 14:34.684
I had retained in my contract the consultation right of who to work with.

14:34.864 --> 14:47.102
And since I absolutely just knew that what made a great photo was emotion and not beauty, I always insisted that the photographer be the photographer that photographs that.

14:47.723 --> 14:54.850
And I think that's what made the campaign successful and standing out from other cosmetic campaigns.

14:54.890 --> 14:59.555
It can be quite flat, you know, it could be, I don't know, it could be quite flat, I think.

14:59.655 --> 15:03.960
It is quite a commentary, though, that... Go ahead, Liz.

15:03.980 --> 15:09.465
No, no, I thought that my coffee was already here, because I'm hallucinating, but then I saw water.

15:12.628 --> 15:15.812
That, you know, at the age of 40, I guess that was the cutoff, right?

15:15.832 --> 15:16.212
Yes.

15:16.563 --> 15:24.693
Well, I think, you know, unfortunately, in the industry of cosmetic and fashion... And even in acting, unfortunately, for women.

15:24.713 --> 15:26.395
Even in acting, and even on television.

15:26.455 --> 15:34.585
You know, a lot of women reporters had asked me that question, as if, like, how dare Lancome do... And then, you know, I said, well, you are in the same business.

15:35.345 --> 15:40.271
We don't see a woman 50 years old being a reporter on television.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.693
Not on television, no.

15:41.926 --> 15:42.507
No, no.

15:42.527 --> 15:43.949
If you're not seen, you're going to be old.

15:43.969 --> 15:47.613
But if you're seen, you don't see old people or middle-aged people.

15:48.654 --> 15:53.280
And that is something that is telling to our society, whether it is right or wrong.

15:54.762 --> 15:55.163
I don't know.

15:55.183 --> 15:56.685
It seems a little sadistic.

15:57.025 --> 16:00.890
But even if it's successful, I mean... That's the thing that surprised me.

16:00.910 --> 16:02.652
They have not discerned any...

16:03.172 --> 16:04.935
Any reduction of the sales?

16:04.995 --> 16:08.159
I mean, there was no loss in market share or anything like that.

16:08.179 --> 16:08.720
Exactly.

16:08.800 --> 16:32.976
They said to me that they feared that on the long run, and they had to take a very futuristic, you know, they couldn't just do by the marketing research that might give them an indication of what to do in the next six months to two years, but that in the long run, you know, four or five years down the road, I was going to be a problem because of my age.

16:33.614 --> 16:43.187
They said that in an ad campaign, what is the responsibility is to represent the dream, not to represent the reality.

16:43.247 --> 16:52.239
The fact that women identify with me because I was middle-aged might have been a reassuring thought, but a campaign has to represent the dream.

16:52.419 --> 16:56.905
And in their marketing research, women say, what we dream is to be young.

16:57.543 --> 17:00.888
then you have to represent that dream with a younger person.

17:00.928 --> 17:02.790
That's the way they argue it.

17:02.810 --> 17:09.740
Unless they're selling a particular product specifically designed to make an older woman look young.

17:10.561 --> 17:24.360
Yes, occasionally, not Lancome, but occasionally other cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder or Revlon have used recently Lauren Hafton.

17:24.492 --> 17:38.071
who had been like me, you know, somebody who stayed 10 years representing Ultima, and then they dropped her, I think, before 40, and then brought her back when she was 50 for the anti-age cream.

17:38.151 --> 17:44.780
And I think they do sell, you know, for a while, but I think they still create this kind of aura of the dream.

17:46.202 --> 17:49.707
I argued, and I am still convinced I'm right,

17:50.075 --> 17:57.422
that if you ask people, would you like to be old or young, they say young, as if you ask a person, would you like to be rich or poor, they say rich.

17:58.343 --> 17:59.624
But there is an articulation.

17:59.664 --> 18:06.510
If they say, would you like to be rich, but don't do the job you like, then they probably say, no, maybe somewhere in between, you know.

18:07.151 --> 18:11.535
The same thing is with, you know, if you ask a person, would you like to be young, they say young.

18:12.135 --> 18:16.319
But I think if you ask them deeper, there is an articulation to the young.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.141
Oh, that's exactly right.

18:18.188 --> 18:23.874
And I think that people want energy, they want to be healthy, they want to fulfill their curiosity.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.796
I think it's less important.

18:26.277 --> 18:37.529
But you don't want to give up the wisdom that if you gather, if you've accumulated wisdom in your years, you know, if you're much smarter now than you were 15 or 20 years ago, you don't want to give that end of it up, do you?

18:37.549 --> 18:38.310
No, no, no.

18:38.731 --> 18:43.656
Yesterday a journalist, I asked her, you know, she asked me this question.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.760
I asked her, what would be your dream?

18:45.840 --> 18:52.149
And she said, she was a woman in her 40s, she said, I would like to have the wisdom that I have today, but my body of 25.

18:52.649 --> 18:55.654
And that's pretty much, you know, it's true.

18:55.714 --> 18:57.136
That is what people wish.

18:57.456 --> 19:02.924
But since we all know we can't have that, what then?

19:04.126 --> 19:05.768
Could it be another dream?

19:06.349 --> 19:07.971
You know, it's fascinating to me.

19:07.991 --> 19:11.336
I'm not asking you any of the questions that everybody always asks you.

19:11.356 --> 19:12.698
I want to do outline in the book.

19:13.100 --> 19:17.565
But it is very interesting to me that you define them by demographics.

19:18.946 --> 19:19.627
That's wonderful.

19:19.647 --> 19:20.248
It really is.

19:20.328 --> 19:20.909
I like that.

19:21.069 --> 19:34.624
It really does identify not only how far-reaching your popularity is, but the different groups, the segments that you can identify strictly by the question that they ask.

19:34.784 --> 19:37.487
That's wonderful.

19:38.075 --> 19:41.640
I guess, are you familiar with a woman named Alice James?

19:41.860 --> 19:46.546
She was the youngest, the sister of Henry James and William James.

19:46.566 --> 19:47.607
And she wrote a diary.

19:48.388 --> 19:55.217
And basically, she's the modern example of what it's like to grow up as the sibling of towering.

19:55.618 --> 19:56.899
Ah, enough to read it.

19:57.019 --> 19:57.961
Of towering.

19:57.981 --> 20:02.747
You know, a towering writer on the one hand and a psychologist on the other.

20:02.767 --> 20:07.693
In your case, for instance, you had not only a magnificently...

20:08.112 --> 20:12.278
talented and beautiful mother, but a fantastically talented and capable father.

20:12.979 --> 20:18.006
And you chose to nevertheless still go into a parallel kind of profession.

20:18.026 --> 20:19.248
You weren't intimidated at all?

20:19.268 --> 20:20.510
Oh, yes, I was.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.131
And how?

20:21.171 --> 20:26.218
That's why I became a model only at 28, and I sat actually at 32 because of that, you know.

20:26.278 --> 20:28.281
I think, yes.

20:29.206 --> 20:30.248
Maybe I'm misreading it.

20:30.428 --> 20:30.688
No.

20:31.569 --> 20:35.676
In the book, I cut down the complaint as much as I could.

20:35.716 --> 20:48.114
No, I was terribly intimidated, and I started to work mostly as a journalist for a comedy show so that my interviews were very light and comical.

20:48.655 --> 20:53.502
And I had done that for eight years until I became a model just by chance.

20:54.503 --> 20:59.010
And the modeling seemed very far from film at the time.

20:59.716 --> 21:08.664
The reason I like modeling so much is that it probably was so remote also from my family.

21:09.485 --> 21:24.339
I found then similarities as I've gotten to know the job that I said, well, there's some acting in modeling, you know, or there is some... And also, somehow, thank you.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.423
And somehow, the people in the fashion world and

21:28.943 --> 21:35.052
entertainment world overlap socially, but there are also great differences.

21:35.653 --> 21:44.946
And I think one of the reasons why I always felt very attached to the fashion world was that it was my world, you know, it was the world.

21:45.066 --> 21:45.808
Interesting, yeah.

21:46.228 --> 21:47.470
You have a twin sister, though.

21:47.530 --> 21:47.790
Yes.

21:48.331 --> 21:53.719
And you say if you weren't twins, you would never have met.

21:54.712 --> 21:56.074
Explain that, if you could.

21:56.354 --> 22:00.099
Here you are, twins, and she's a medievalist, is that right?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.701
Yes, she's a medievalist.

22:01.781 --> 22:10.432
I'm writing a book that is paying a lot of attention to medieval manuscripts, and when I read that she's a medievalist, I thought that was very interesting.

22:10.572 --> 22:13.135
Yeah, she has a PhD in medieval literature.

22:13.175 --> 22:13.455
Really?

22:13.535 --> 22:16.499
And is she here in the United States?

22:16.519 --> 22:18.261
Yes, at Columbia University.

22:19.663 --> 22:20.444
She's a scholar.

22:20.825 --> 22:23.588
But I think, you know, I have to say, maybe that goes to...

22:24.563 --> 22:25.865
my parents' credit.

22:25.945 --> 22:31.171
We were seven, and all of us are doing something different and what we like.

22:34.235 --> 22:40.883
Somehow, you know, my sister Pia became a journalist, and then she ended up being a film critic.

22:41.424 --> 22:41.924
In New York.

22:42.125 --> 22:45.148
I met your sister when she was a journalist in San Francisco.

22:45.289 --> 22:45.929
Oh, really?

22:45.969 --> 22:46.270
Yes.

22:46.590 --> 22:47.331
Many years ago.

22:47.391 --> 22:50.575
I was a young junior officer on an aircraft carrier.

22:50.915 --> 22:51.416
Really?

22:51.476 --> 22:53.018
In San Francisco, and she

22:53.302 --> 22:54.804
That's how she started.

22:54.844 --> 22:55.325
That's right.

22:55.445 --> 22:59.351
She came out and did a story on my ship, and I was the public affairs officer.

22:59.371 --> 23:07.484
I remember showing her around and seeing the thing, and that was Pia Lindstrom, that was Ingrid Bergman's daughter, and that was kind of cool.

23:08.526 --> 23:13.213
So I met your sister, if only for, you know, half an hour.

23:13.373 --> 23:20.845
And then there is Ingrid, and my brother is a businessman, and then I have another sister who is a dancer.

23:21.230 --> 23:25.797
and she went to live in Latin America, she lives in Venezuela, and she's a quite known dancer.

23:25.837 --> 23:32.347
She has a very avant-garde dance company, and she travels to Argentina, Chile, she tours all the time.

23:32.367 --> 23:42.482
You see, what this suggests is that, you know, all of the children didn't seem to be damaged at all by having these extraordinarily famous parents.

23:42.502 --> 23:43.484
I think we were, yes.

23:43.504 --> 23:48.992
It's obvious from the achievements, you know, and that they're so different, and that everybody isn't trying to emulate

23:49.462 --> 23:52.527
No, I don't think so.

23:52.567 --> 23:53.208
Not even you.

23:53.228 --> 24:02.882
No, I don't know if it is that, because sometimes in America, people in the film business, they are placed in a social scale that is so high.

24:03.022 --> 24:07.769
I know that it is less in Europe, so I don't know if that helped.

24:07.789 --> 24:11.875
Growing up in Europe, we just had successful parents in their business, but somewhat.

24:12.260 --> 24:16.005
You're not a godlike figure if you're a director or an actress.

24:16.285 --> 24:18.548
Actually, directors a little bit, I've got to say.

24:19.530 --> 24:24.557
The director is actually held in a higher... More than actors, oh yes, in Europe, you know.

24:24.637 --> 24:31.185
In fact, when I say at the beginning of my book, somebody says, you know, you are Roberto Rossellini's daughter.

24:31.326 --> 24:39.617
I know that he's from Europe, because you're... Or at least a lover of... Somebody who adopted European manners and culture.

24:39.637 --> 24:41.980
How about has an appreciation for fine film for...

24:42.550 --> 24:44.272
the cerebral qualities.

24:44.372 --> 24:45.854
Yes.

24:46.375 --> 24:51.842
You did a movie with, God, I can't remember the name of it, but it was with Goldie Hawn.

24:51.882 --> 24:53.144
Death Becomes.

24:53.164 --> 24:58.871
That's right, but the whole theme there was the image and staying young forever.

24:59.132 --> 25:00.233
Oh, absolutely.

25:00.453 --> 25:04.699
And that must have been, you know, that was an interesting exercise.

25:04.719 --> 25:10.026
It's very popular in the fashion world, that film, because it...

25:10.495 --> 25:21.847
I wanted so much to do it because it amused me that I had been for so many years representing that, you know, representing creams.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.829
You are the bearer of the magic magic.

25:23.849 --> 25:24.249
Absolutely.

25:24.930 --> 25:26.031
I've read the script.

25:26.071 --> 25:29.194
My agent sent it to me, and I said, oh, I have to do this part.

25:29.855 --> 25:33.238
And I was the first one that went and tested for Robert Zemak.

25:33.258 --> 25:33.499
Really?

25:33.559 --> 25:35.721
Robert Zemak said, I have to see other people, too.

25:36.422 --> 25:38.764
And I was very disappointed because I thought, well...

25:39.453 --> 25:40.715
He did it instantly, yeah.

25:40.735 --> 25:41.858
You know, they forget.

25:41.918 --> 25:46.546
If I'm the first one, by the time they've seen 200, they forget the first one, even if you're good.

25:46.787 --> 25:50.434
He said he remembered it, and he offered me the part two months later.

25:50.454 --> 25:55.283
But it's almost exactly the kind of thing we're talking about, if you could stay young forever.

25:55.884 --> 25:56.505
Absolutely.

25:56.525 --> 25:59.571
And of course, it's very comical.

26:00.057 --> 26:01.419
Tragic consequences.

26:03.601 --> 26:12.072
But you know, there is a line that I say in the book that often people yell at me in the street, which is, screw the natural law, because the natural law is to grow old and accept it.

26:12.652 --> 26:16.337
And people in this room sometimes say, screw the natural law.

26:16.958 --> 26:18.079
I'm quoting the film.

26:18.099 --> 26:19.481
It doesn't seem to bother you, though.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.723
If it does, you certainly... It hasn't.

26:21.763 --> 26:22.584
Right now, it hasn't.

26:22.604 --> 26:23.205
A little bit.

26:23.225 --> 26:28.832
You know, a little bit is all this discussion about Lancome, that let me go, and all that.

26:29.015 --> 26:31.838
I'm a little bit afraid to bore people.

26:31.878 --> 26:33.260
It seems like a broken record.

26:33.520 --> 26:38.767
Every time, I'm afraid that then one day people say, oh, enough with that complaint.

26:38.927 --> 26:39.828
But it isn't me.

26:39.848 --> 26:47.918
It just seemed, I cannot tell you how many people today at the bookstore, almost every other woman that came up said, I'm against Lancôme.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.099
Okay, they do that for you.

26:49.279 --> 26:51.842
And I wished in a way to say, well, but life goes on.

26:52.163 --> 26:53.324
They go on, I go on.

26:53.404 --> 26:54.225
Maybe it's a mistake.

26:54.265 --> 26:55.787
Maybe it was right.

26:55.907 --> 26:56.368
I don't know.

26:56.828 --> 26:57.469
Meanwhile,

26:58.107 --> 26:59.048
Right now, I'm sorry.

26:59.068 --> 27:04.997
So what do you see for yourself in terms of your professional development?

27:05.017 --> 27:08.141
Because life does go on, and you can't be the Lancome girl.

27:08.221 --> 27:09.022
Yeah, no, no.

27:09.122 --> 27:15.211
Well, you know, in that domain, I was going to try to develop my own line of cosmetic.

27:15.771 --> 27:17.634
It has been pretty interesting.

27:17.674 --> 27:26.967
It has been a very slow process, because the money that you need to gather...

27:27.318 --> 27:31.905
to do an international campaign are way beyond any film.

27:31.945 --> 27:37.273
So up to now, I've really mostly talked to investors.

27:37.954 --> 27:40.337
But it was interesting, because I've never been in that position.

27:40.858 --> 27:41.719
So it was a businesswoman.

27:41.739 --> 27:42.060
Yes.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.543
So it was kind of interesting to discover it.

27:46.967 --> 27:49.771
But then, you know, I think I'll do films.

27:50.011 --> 27:51.133
I think I'll do more films.

27:51.994 --> 27:54.658
And I liked, you know what I liked about writing?

27:56.326 --> 28:00.452
When I was little, I always thought I was going to be a film director, like my dad.

28:01.113 --> 28:05.599
And I wanted to do films on animal behavior, because I was always interested in animal behavior there.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.243
I do talk about animals.

28:08.543 --> 28:11.608
You do, and they share space with the ghosts, as a matter of fact.

28:11.628 --> 28:12.229
Right.

28:12.249 --> 28:21.282
And then when I saw the bugs eating my mother's plant, and then I got involved in their life and sex life, and my mother's, Ingrid Bergman, roses, died.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.708
So when I was a child, I was hoping to...

28:26.178 --> 28:35.729
to become a feature director, to be able to write feature story, but with an animal behavior, not documentary, but feature story.

28:36.489 --> 28:55.290
Now, that never became a reality, mostly because I think I didn't take the time to even attempt to write a script about animal behavior, or maybe it's impossible to do, or maybe the other thing came to me and took me out of my path.

28:55.591 --> 29:10.288
But what I enjoyed when I wrote the book, I enjoyed the fact that often when you work as an actress or as a model, you cater to somebody else's idea, and you never know what they're going to use of you.

29:10.308 --> 29:12.891
You never know which one of the take they're going to take.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.795
They sometimes print the take you don't want, or you feel ashamed.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.578
Same thing when you take a photo.

29:18.929 --> 29:23.635
You know, you offer yourself, but you can make a mistake, and the photographer might like that one.

29:23.675 --> 29:24.897
And the selection is theirs.

29:25.077 --> 29:26.258
The selection is theirs.

29:26.459 --> 29:27.720
You're getting paid for your time.

29:28.301 --> 29:28.862
Exactly.

29:28.902 --> 29:34.008
You know, you have to make yourself available and hopefully interpret their thoughts.

29:35.130 --> 29:39.676
When I wrote the book, I have to say that I didn't know that you have so much control.

29:39.936 --> 29:40.617
It's wonderful, isn't it?

29:40.799 --> 29:42.681
People call me and say, how do you want to call it?

29:42.981 --> 29:44.683
I said, the title, I have to find the title.

29:45.064 --> 29:47.506
Don't you do a marketing research first?

29:48.027 --> 29:50.870
And then decide which one would be the title?

29:50.910 --> 29:52.932
Don't you have the marketing people decide?

29:52.952 --> 29:55.195
Then they call me and they say, well, how do you want the cover?

29:55.215 --> 29:59.119
The cover, I said, do I have to find, you're asking me, you want me to find the cover?

29:59.660 --> 30:02.443
I couldn't believe that a book, there was so much control.

30:02.503 --> 30:06.267
And it was fun, not for the control, but it was fun to...

30:07.445 --> 30:21.920
I have to say that there is not one word in this book that I can disclaim, or I have to say, I wish I didn't do that, or about every film I've done, you know, you say, well, overall it's nice, but I wish they haven't cut that scene, or I wish that... This is yours.

30:22.341 --> 30:23.402
Yes, this is mine.

30:23.462 --> 30:24.983
It's a good feeling, isn't it?

30:25.143 --> 30:29.768
It's a good feeling, you know, unless you bore people, and they don't have to buy you then.

30:30.069 --> 30:31.090
But then they won't.

30:31.410 --> 30:34.313
I had a book published two years ago, and it was a...

30:35.238 --> 30:36.640
It's had six printings.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.604
It was a finalist for the National Book Critics or a board.

30:40.846 --> 30:41.687
It was huge.

30:41.727 --> 30:43.329
It was 638 pages.

30:43.350 --> 30:45.993
And, you know, you approve... Once you wrote, you wrote.

30:46.153 --> 30:47.415
I wrote.

30:47.776 --> 30:53.584
But you approve everything, and you give permission, and they don't change a damn thing unless... No.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.108
Unless we discuss it.

30:55.528 --> 30:56.129
Exactly.

30:56.149 --> 30:56.830
Isn't that wonderful?

30:57.050 --> 30:58.032
It is wonderful.

30:58.652 --> 30:59.474
And I like that.

30:59.534 --> 31:02.578
And you talk about the pleasures of getting older.

31:02.618 --> 31:03.479
That's the kind of thing.

31:03.499 --> 31:04.200
Exactly.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.402
You're going in the right direction.

31:05.462 --> 31:06.403
Exactly.

31:06.423 --> 31:09.627
You're really going to be in a position where you can use your head.

31:10.128 --> 31:13.212
And you don't rely entirely on... You know what it was?

31:13.272 --> 31:14.594
Exactly.

31:14.694 --> 31:15.876
More than...

31:16.261 --> 31:20.386
More than the sense of power, of control, it wasn't that the sense of satisfaction.

31:20.887 --> 31:22.269
I felt fully engaged.

31:22.349 --> 31:28.277
Sometimes when you're an actress, you're engaged the moment you act, but then a lot of the time you just wait around for your turn.

31:28.757 --> 31:29.819
Same thing as a model.

31:29.879 --> 31:31.601
You're not completely engaged.

31:31.621 --> 31:34.205
There are moments where you say, oh, this is so great.

31:34.805 --> 31:41.374
But many days and many hours are just, you are obediently waiting, just making yourself available.

31:42.130 --> 31:51.621
And this was very wonderful because it engaged everything of me, you know, my mind, my humor, my memories.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.784
It was very engaging, engaging.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.586
And nobody was really telling you what to do.

31:55.606 --> 31:56.387
No.

31:56.687 --> 31:57.708
You're waiting as a model.

31:57.768 --> 32:03.175
Finally, your time comes, and they instruct you as to what they want and what they would like you to do for them.

32:03.615 --> 32:03.936
Exactly.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.278
You're doing this for yourself, I would guess.

32:06.298 --> 32:07.079
Yes.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.141
And you wrote it yourself.

32:08.201 --> 32:09.442
We should make it very clear.

32:09.843 --> 32:10.163
Yes.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.308
you know, what happens today, this is very unusual.

32:14.530 --> 32:21.858
I mean, most of these, quote, celebrity books are really not written by the individuals themselves, which I guess is another reason I'm here.

32:22.159 --> 32:25.903
I'm not interested in talking to people who dictate their books to other people.

32:25.923 --> 32:27.986
Yes, I couldn't believe that, because I heard that.

32:28.446 --> 32:30.489
It's remarkable.

32:31.390 --> 32:33.492
But even autobiographies, I mean, to an extent.

32:33.512 --> 32:33.993
Oh, indeed.

32:34.013 --> 32:36.015
And I was looking throughout here to see who the

32:36.316 --> 32:39.220
who you were thanking.

32:39.240 --> 32:43.847
And you were the only one you thanked was Bob Gottlieb, who is one of the great, you know, one of the great editors.

32:43.887 --> 32:44.248
Yes.

32:44.408 --> 32:46.811
So you were very, very lucky to have him.

32:46.831 --> 32:47.432
Very lucky.

32:47.472 --> 32:49.055
But you know, I didn't expect to have him.

32:49.275 --> 32:56.525
I knew Bob Gottlieb because Bob Gottlieb's best friend was Irene Selznick, David Selznick's wife.

32:57.026 --> 32:59.009
And Irene was my mother's best friend.

32:59.590 --> 33:01.733
When Irene and my mother died,

33:02.152 --> 33:06.977
I had all Irene's letter that Irene wrote to my mother.

33:07.057 --> 33:09.419
I inherited my mother's archive.

33:09.439 --> 33:14.184
And Bob inherited Irene's archive, so he had all my mother's letter.

33:14.564 --> 33:24.033
So we called to exchange letters, and then we put them in all, and we read this fantastic correspondence between these two great labels.

33:24.093 --> 33:24.734
Have you published any of that?

33:24.854 --> 33:25.715
No, we haven't.

33:25.955 --> 33:26.696
You know, we haven't.

33:26.716 --> 33:27.336
Is it worth publishing?

33:27.356 --> 33:28.277
Is it good?

33:29.354 --> 33:39.993
Probably you need to add more things, because a lot of it is how is the children and... Yeah, well, I mean, you certainly would edit out the minutiae, as we say, but is there a narrative there?

33:41.014 --> 33:43.278
Not really.

33:43.298 --> 33:43.799
No, I don't think so.

33:43.819 --> 33:51.733
There's a book that was just published that compares Virginia Woolf's diary and Catherine Mansfield's diary, and they were very good friends.

33:51.764 --> 33:54.507
And they were writing in their diaries about each other.

33:55.167 --> 33:55.528
Right.

33:55.548 --> 33:56.629
And that's kind of interesting.

33:56.649 --> 33:58.351
I think some work would have to be done.

33:58.371 --> 33:59.772
You know, Mother kept a diary.

34:00.192 --> 34:06.098
And, you know, I think with the correspondence, the diary, maybe other letter to David Selznick and other people of the time.

34:06.639 --> 34:12.825
But Mother wrote a very beautiful autobiography, and so did Irene, so that we felt that, you know, we never thought about it.

34:12.865 --> 34:20.072
And this probably doesn't add any additional insight to what they already wrote in their autobiography.

34:20.152 --> 34:20.473
Exactly.

34:20.553 --> 34:20.893
No.

34:21.616 --> 34:32.185
But that's how I met Bob, and when I wrote, you know, when I said to you that my lawyer said, you're always negative, you don't want to do an autobiography, you don't want to do this, you know, then write something.

34:33.006 --> 34:39.031
I wrote something, but I didn't show it to my lawyer, because I didn't trust him to give the judgment.

34:39.471 --> 34:51.201
So when I had a hundred pages, I called Bob, and I said, Bob, I have been solicited to do, you know, the awful gossipy biography, to do the stupid book on style, the book that wouldn't be mine about photography, but...

34:51.721 --> 35:01.274
But it's true, they did have a point when they said, you're always negative, and you turn down things just with this negative attitude, and not too many people have this opportunity.

35:01.294 --> 35:02.956
So I said, I wrote 100 pages.

35:03.557 --> 35:16.635
You tell me if you think that they are valid, and it's going to be quite a light book, but if it is stupid or too personal, just tell me what you think.

35:16.695 --> 35:20.260
He read it, and he said, I like it a lot, and I'd like to be your editor.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.596
But you have to write another 200 pages.

35:23.357 --> 35:23.997
And so I did.

35:24.017 --> 35:29.685
And then when we had this manuscript of about 250, I never arrived at three.

35:29.765 --> 35:32.047
So he freelanced it for Random House?

35:32.067 --> 35:32.388
Yes.

35:32.568 --> 35:36.012
Because normally they have their own editors, so they went out and... No.

35:36.093 --> 35:43.682
I talked to Bob to say about... Once I wrote 100 pages, I said, I'm not going to keep on writing if this is not going anywhere.

35:44.084 --> 35:46.849
Random House agreed to hire him as the editor for the book.

35:46.889 --> 35:48.491
Yeah, he took it to Random House.

35:48.632 --> 35:50.014
I just worked with him.

35:50.034 --> 35:50.435
Oh, I see.

35:50.655 --> 35:52.258
I just sent Bob the hundred pages.

35:52.558 --> 35:59.410
He said, you continue it, and I'm going to be your editor, but you first finish the book, so I know if we have a book.

36:00.487 --> 36:04.592
So I finished the book, and then I gave him the manuscript, and he said, we'll go to Random.

36:04.932 --> 36:06.934
And, you know, it was easy.

36:07.114 --> 36:08.416
It was easy once he, you know.

36:08.456 --> 36:10.318
Yeah, it was Knopf, which is part of Random.

36:10.558 --> 36:11.739
He was the editor of Knopf.

36:11.759 --> 36:12.400
Knopf, yes.

36:12.540 --> 36:14.142
But he thought he wasn't a book for Knopf.

36:14.162 --> 36:15.504
He went directly to Random.

36:15.704 --> 36:17.526
No, it couldn't be better.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.066
It's wonderful.

36:18.547 --> 36:20.729
Listen, I have to deliver you downstairs in a few minutes.

36:20.749 --> 36:21.971
Would you inscribe this for me?

36:21.991 --> 36:22.691
Sure, thanks.

36:22.852 --> 36:23.873
Thank you very much.

36:26.255 --> 36:27.777
She asked me to have you downstairs.
