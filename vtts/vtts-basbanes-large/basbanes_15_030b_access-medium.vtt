WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:02.995
And there's something.

00:03.296 --> 00:30.173
Inevitably, there's a vision being put forward there in that story by me, you know, that has something to do with some belief that I've at least begun to develop in my life, that it's what we have here right now in front of us, what we're surrounded by, what's touchable, what's knowable, that really matters, and that we have to have some kind of a spiritual basis, whatever that may be.

00:30.727 --> 00:37.017
for keeping us grounded here, and that this is where the real adventure is, this is where the real excitement is.

00:39.121 --> 00:47.054
Whereas I think I didn't know that at an earlier time in my life, and what I wanted more than anything else was to get the hell out of myself.

00:48.496 --> 00:53.985
Anything that would take me out of myself was where I wanted to be.

00:54.025 --> 00:56.329
And that's who Cookson is.

00:56.562 --> 00:57.884
That's what he has done.

00:57.944 --> 01:00.767
That's what he's practiced throughout his life.

01:01.348 --> 01:02.970
He's basically a pretty good guy.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.734
I don't think he's a bad person.

01:06.735 --> 01:10.740
He's kind of lost.

01:10.760 --> 01:15.005
In terms of generating sympathy from the reader, though, we do have to work, I think.

01:15.025 --> 01:15.846
I think you have to work.

01:16.147 --> 01:18.690
I think you have to be able to put up with him.

01:21.073 --> 01:24.257
I take him to

01:25.756 --> 01:31.784
I'm thinking of things like, you know that old story by Flannery O'Connor called The Misfit?

01:32.625 --> 01:45.141
Well, what I love about that story is what she said about that story somewhere, maybe in her letters, which is that even the misfit, who was like this murderer, is not in his soul a bad person, you know?

01:46.102 --> 01:52.270
And the grandmother in that story is certainly not a bad person, though she's really a pain in the ass.

01:52.672 --> 01:54.915
You know, she just rattles on and on and on and on.

01:54.956 --> 01:57.780
She has all these prejudices and things.

01:58.301 --> 02:14.806
And then what happens, what Flary O'Connor gives the misfit to say, the words that she puts in his mouth at the end of the story, is something like, I'm paraphrasing, she would have been a good woman if she'd had somebody there to shoot her every day of her life.

02:15.667 --> 02:21.396
And that really summarized O'Connor's, you know, sort of theology in a way, as it pertains to human life.

02:22.237 --> 02:32.211
And that has left an impression on me, and it's what I truly believe, is that we're all basically really good people, but we really need somebody to shoot us every day of our lives.

02:32.231 --> 02:35.555
We need to get hit over the head by something.

02:37.378 --> 02:48.393
And the experience that this character has is a kind of... It hits him hard enough over his head that it's going to be an awakening for him.

02:49.174 --> 02:52.058
And he sort of gets it that he's got...

02:52.342 --> 02:53.263
to make a change.

02:53.703 --> 02:59.689
So you say clearly he is about to embark on a new spiritual... Yeah.

03:00.489 --> 03:02.671
Do you see that clearly, where he's going?

03:03.232 --> 03:13.481
I don't know all the particulars about how he's going to do it, and that's, you know, the sort of artistic risk that's taken in the book of having a... It's better that way, though, I think.

03:13.501 --> 03:16.984
You know, I don't want to lead him through the particulars of his spiritual journey.

03:17.004 --> 03:21.268
Is it the kind of thing that provides the stuff of another novel?

03:21.839 --> 03:23.942
Well, maybe, I don't know, but maybe.

03:26.126 --> 03:36.883
What we see him, you know, at the very end, well, you say you're not going to give away things, but, you know, he's thinking about this exploration of the Charles River.

03:37.565 --> 03:46.319
And he even acknowledges that it's kind of overly obvious that he's going from the supernatural to the obviously natural.

03:46.379 --> 03:47.661
Mm-hmm.

03:47.877 --> 04:15.950
And I don't think that he's going to become a different person from exploring the Charles River, but it's a good place to start, you know, because it's an active, conscious turning away for him, you know, from these sort of dark, exciting kinds of experiences to something that is part of the natural world to which we are organically connected as people, you know.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.412
So that's why it's a,

04:17.712 --> 04:20.815
How about these supernatural experiences?

04:20.835 --> 04:23.758
Is that something that you're familiar with?

04:23.778 --> 04:24.739
Oh, not very much.

04:25.740 --> 04:26.461
Not very much.

04:28.183 --> 04:43.078
I'm really interested in them, and I think my interest in them over the years has been a kind of, you know, the reason he was interested in them, because they were otherworldly, literally because they were otherworldly.

04:43.565 --> 04:50.115
And I wanted, I was so interested in escaping this world that anything that was otherworldly was intriguing to me.

04:50.135 --> 04:53.120
You were interested in escaping this world.

04:53.140 --> 04:53.500
Yeah.

04:53.520 --> 05:03.816
Well, you know, in the sense that this world is my world, is me, you know, getting out of me, getting out of my world, getting out of the world, all that kind of stuff, you know.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.539
And listen, if you don't mind jumping down.

05:11.358 --> 05:12.902
Was it because of performance?

05:13.022 --> 05:13.082
Me?

05:13.102 --> 05:14.085
Yeah, anxiety.

05:14.325 --> 05:15.669
No, I don't think it really was.

05:16.230 --> 05:27.679
And I'm not at all certain that I would have been able to have a career as a performer, you know, even if I hadn't had stage fright, because...

05:28.351 --> 05:35.921
Because, you know, when I was in college, I was still only at an intermediate, somewhere between advanced and intermediate level.

05:35.941 --> 05:37.923
It presumes a level of ability, I guess.

05:37.943 --> 05:38.604
Yes, it does.

05:38.644 --> 05:42.089
You know, and I don't know whether I would have been able to become a concert pianist.

05:43.491 --> 05:52.062
You know, I mean, I think I had some talent there, but I don't know if... So that just really makes good copy that that's the reason... Oh, absolutely.

05:52.082 --> 05:55.506
You know, if it weren't for stage fright, you know... Yeah, no, it wasn't...

05:55.790 --> 05:56.831
It was a lot of things.

05:56.912 --> 05:59.115
I mean, it was partly just being lost.

06:00.236 --> 06:06.525
It was somehow, you know, I mean, when I went to school to study music, it was, again, you know, to explore the possibilities for myself.

06:06.645 --> 06:13.375
And in exploring it, I saw that this really isn't something I'm particularly interested in doing.

06:14.176 --> 06:17.080
I think that's the best way to handle it.

06:18.542 --> 06:18.642
Yeah.

06:24.865 --> 06:26.226
I guess you're from Alabama.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.068
Right.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.630
I'm from Mobile, Alabama.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.572
I was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama.

06:32.313 --> 06:33.314
My parents still live there.

06:34.916 --> 06:45.547
And you've been quoted in some pieces, and again, I have a lot of Southern papers, so I'm not particularly interested in battling the South in any way.

06:45.868 --> 06:48.010
But you haven't lived there for a long time.

06:48.030 --> 06:48.190
Right.

06:48.423 --> 06:52.087
But you nevertheless continue to write about it in some aspect or another.

06:52.547 --> 06:53.528
Yeah.

06:53.548 --> 06:56.351
What is this, just because it's what you're familiar with?

06:56.771 --> 06:57.352
Partly that.

06:57.432 --> 07:04.679
You know, it's where my roots are, and like a lot of people, you know, I have a lot of ambivalent feelings about my roots.

07:06.901 --> 07:18.312
There was a lot of emotional pain attached to growing up in the South that I think, for me, had very specific

07:18.899 --> 07:22.943
very specifically to do with the Southern culture.

07:23.204 --> 07:28.870
And I was coming of age down there at a time when the civil rights movement was at its height.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.573
I had some kind of an identification.

07:31.673 --> 07:36.438
I don't know where I got it from, but I was given it in some way.

07:36.458 --> 07:47.590
I had some identification, some kind of empathy with the plight of blacks in a society where that wasn't so cool.

07:48.076 --> 07:54.044
and so some of my experiences there were painful in that regard.

07:55.165 --> 08:01.693
And I think that when I left the South as a young person, it was an active rejection of the South.

08:03.736 --> 08:16.412
Now, in my middle age, though I haven't lived there for a long time, and I would have to think really long and hard about choosing to live there again, I miss

08:17.152 --> 08:23.159
the connection that I imagined I would have to my roots.

08:24.040 --> 08:30.888
And I'm thinking about trying in the near future to spend a little more time down there.

08:32.069 --> 08:34.532
Just to see what it feels like at this point.

08:34.772 --> 08:35.613
This will work fine.

08:35.733 --> 08:39.878
I know the South has changed.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.039
I know that I've changed.

08:41.139 --> 08:46.045
And I'm interested to see what it feels like to be there again and spend some time there again.

08:46.210 --> 08:50.294
You lived in New York, you lived in the Bay Area, you've lived here.

08:50.815 --> 08:55.940
This is kind of a combination of following where opportunities are, I guess, education is.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.122
Are you still teaching, by the way?

08:58.382 --> 08:59.523
No, I'm not teaching.

08:59.643 --> 09:00.944
I haven't taught in a long time.

09:01.545 --> 09:02.906
Okay.

09:04.188 --> 09:08.472
I guess, you know, I'd have to cover that ground that I read elsewhere.

09:08.492 --> 09:13.737
You know, you've lived in the Bay Area, you lived in New York for quite some time, I guess.

09:14.189 --> 09:17.913
And now we've been in Boston for 10 years.

09:18.694 --> 09:24.059
And really, I mean, for me, what keeps me here is just, you know, bringing up a family here.

09:24.139 --> 09:26.442
You know, the kids are in school and all that sort of thing.

09:26.462 --> 09:40.416
And because I can live anywhere I want to live at this point in my life as a writer, I could be living somewhere else, but there's not any real reason for me to uproot the kids and take them somewhere else.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.960
And, you know, it's not like some other place you've got getting

09:45.323 --> 09:48.567
calling you off, to a siren calling you off.

09:48.587 --> 09:58.520
Well, in some ways I do think, and I'm not sure I'm right about this, but in a lot of ways, you know, I do feel called to other places, to places that I consider.

09:58.560 --> 10:05.929
I mean, some of this may just be the, you know, the other side of the fence, you know, the grass is greater on the other side of the fence kind of thing.

10:06.650 --> 10:13.018
But we have here a life that's really highly functional and

10:13.437 --> 10:14.939
feels to me really healthy.

10:15.539 --> 10:19.364
The kids are really thriving.

10:19.684 --> 10:22.608
We have a really healthy family.

10:22.708 --> 10:26.212
We have good, supportive friends.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.435
I'm involved in the kids' school to a great extent.

10:30.016 --> 10:33.861
It's a life that really works well, and I feel like it's a really healthy life.

10:35.042 --> 10:37.104
I wouldn't have any other way.

10:37.144 --> 10:42.010
For all of those same reasons, it's not a life

10:43.340 --> 10:47.645
that I feel compelled to write out of a lot.

10:47.665 --> 10:48.726
Do you know what I mean?

10:48.906 --> 10:58.257
You know, I mean, it's the... So, in some ways, I imagine living... Creatively, it's almost neutral.

10:58.437 --> 11:02.762
It really is, you know, for those very reasons that it makes it a good life.

11:05.425 --> 11:12.132
And, you know, so I do feel, you know, like...

11:12.753 --> 11:18.338
I do feel the call sometimes of the South, you know, where I imagine it to be more colorful.

11:20.000 --> 11:42.220
You know, most of my friends sort of think the same way that we think, and that's why they're our friends, and, you know, I'm not constantly confronting issues, nor what I want to be, but, you know what I mean, it's like, it's not, there's not, it feels a little colorless to me in terms of

11:43.128 --> 11:44.291
of being a writer.

11:47.337 --> 11:51.767
But that's what I'm doing right now, and I'm not inclined to change that.

11:52.107 --> 11:54.633
Do you see yourself writing out of any kind of tradition?

11:59.503 --> 12:00.666
No, I don't believe I do.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.111
I mean, I don't.

12:03.901 --> 12:09.949
I mean, the only thing that came to mind when you said tradition was that it seems to me that my fiction really is very traditional.

12:09.969 --> 12:10.970
You know what I mean?

12:11.110 --> 12:11.951
That's not what I mean.

12:11.971 --> 12:13.073
Yeah, but that's not what you mean.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.594
You know, it's conventional.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.801
I mean, certainly though, you studied under Conroy.

12:19.921 --> 12:23.025
I guess you get some... Were you at Iowa for a while?

12:23.045 --> 12:23.946
No, I was never at Iowa.

12:23.966 --> 12:24.987
You were at Stanford, right?

12:25.048 --> 12:25.648
I was at Stanford.

12:25.728 --> 12:26.590
Yeah, right.

12:26.610 --> 12:28.592
But I mean, there were certain...

12:35.474 --> 12:37.916
which is good to my view.

12:37.936 --> 12:40.338
I mean, the minimalist stuff and all that.

12:41.659 --> 12:49.686
Yeah, I was very frustrated by the minimalist stuff for a few years because I wasn't inclined in that direction.

12:49.726 --> 12:59.895
And it seemed to me that that was getting lauded a lot, you know, in the industry.

13:01.716 --> 13:05.059
The whole sort of less is more

13:05.697 --> 13:17.438
trend that Carver was spearheading for a long time, and everybody was sort of writing stories that were Carver-esque for a while, and I felt— Did you like them?

13:17.458 --> 13:23.749
No disrespect to Carver, but just to that, you know, maybe not to make it personal, but just that kind of writing.

13:27.435 --> 13:28.397
Not very much.

13:29.204 --> 13:35.711
I mean, you know, the reason so many people were trying to imitate Carver, it seemed to me, was because he did it really well.

13:37.173 --> 13:40.857
And so it was kind of amazing when he was able to bring something off.

13:41.038 --> 13:42.820
And almost made it look effortless.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.201
He made it look effortless.

13:45.783 --> 13:52.571
You know, I happened to be teaching creative writing out at Stanford during that time, and my students really wanted to imitate him.

13:53.372 --> 13:56.015
They really enjoyed reading him.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.958
And I could never quite get past

13:59.090 --> 14:06.758
the feeling that there was something, that one of the reasons they liked Carver as much as they did is that it was kind of easy.

14:07.699 --> 14:25.359
That I thought back to my studying piano when I was a kid, and I discovered a book of pieces, and I'd bring them in at my music teacher, and I'd say, I really love these pieces, and I'd play them, and I really loved them, and I'd tell her I really loved them, and she'd sort of smile and say, you know why you love them.

14:25.940 --> 14:26.700
And I'd say, why?

14:26.740 --> 14:28.202
And she'd say, because they're easy.

14:28.773 --> 14:37.904
And I sort of felt that way about in my students' relationship to Carver during the time, was because I don't believe that what he was doing was easy.

14:38.685 --> 14:44.373
But I believe he made it look easy in a way that made them feel that they could imitate it.

14:44.873 --> 14:56.788
And it was very hard to put your finger on why he was succeeding when he succeeded, and they were not succeeding at trying to do the same thing.

14:57.022 --> 15:01.489
And, you know, I mean, the stories of his that I read... That's my quote.

15:01.809 --> 15:02.971
I love that quote.

15:02.991 --> 15:04.614
I just love the quote.

15:04.794 --> 15:05.795
You know why you love them?

15:05.816 --> 15:06.557
Because they're easy?

15:06.597 --> 15:08.660
Is that what you mean?

15:08.680 --> 15:09.321
For the whole thing.

15:09.341 --> 15:09.641
Oh, okay.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.823
Very hard to put my finger on.

15:11.003 --> 15:11.925
Yeah.

15:11.945 --> 15:21.139
Well, and it seemed to me that a lot of...

15:21.305 --> 15:26.112
Ray's stories left me feeling kind of flat, left me feeling a little cold.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.215
Some of them just blew me away.

15:28.255 --> 15:35.465
But then there were these times when I felt like, well, that didn't really accomplish very much.

15:35.645 --> 15:42.775
It seems to me that nothing was revealed here that I could really sink my teeth into.

15:42.816 --> 15:50.907
It seemed to me that after a while, they accumulated in such a way that left me feeling a little frustrated.

15:51.292 --> 16:00.669
You know, the whole thing about characters not being able to communicate with each other just didn't wear very well after a while, it seemed to me.

16:00.689 --> 16:06.359
Because after a while, you wanted to yell at them, you know, why don't you say what you feel here, you know?

16:07.581 --> 16:14.093
So, I don't know, you know, I feel like I appreciated the work.

16:15.355 --> 16:18.480
But I didn't resonate with the sensibility in it.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.505
I mean, one of his things was, you know, quick in and quick out.

16:22.046 --> 16:24.429
Well, I just, that was not my experience of writing.

16:24.790 --> 16:32.302
My experience of writing was very slowly and tortuously in and very slowly and tortuously out.

16:32.482 --> 16:33.544
Are you a rewriter?

16:33.564 --> 16:35.086
Are you a tireless rewriter?

16:35.106 --> 16:36.308
Do you revise a lot?

16:36.649 --> 16:38.251
Yeah, and I do most of it as I go.

16:38.271 --> 16:40.214
Do you work on a computer?

16:40.314 --> 16:41.076
Yes, I do.

16:42.318 --> 16:42.578
Yeah.

16:43.013 --> 16:48.440
Thank God, because I do so much revising as I go, but that just makes that process so much easier.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.486
So there are no variant drafts that exist, probably, in your work?

16:53.006 --> 16:56.792
Do you print stuff out first, don't you?

16:56.952 --> 17:09.088
Yeah, there are some variant drafts, but really, for the most part, one sentence builds on the next sentence, builds on the next sentence, and so by the time...

17:09.710 --> 17:12.694
I'm done with what I consider to be a first draft.

17:12.754 --> 17:13.856
It's pretty polished.

17:14.577 --> 17:16.380
And that's the computer.

17:16.420 --> 17:17.521
That's writing with the computer.

17:17.702 --> 17:20.846
Yeah, that's part of it, but it's also the way that I write.

17:21.447 --> 17:24.431
I just, for some reason, I have to get it right before I go to the next one.

17:24.451 --> 17:27.896
I can't go on to sentence two until I'm happy with sentence one.

17:27.916 --> 17:28.998
Exactly, yeah.

17:29.018 --> 17:30.120
And that's just the way it is.

17:30.140 --> 17:31.181
Right, yeah.

17:31.201 --> 17:38.772
The variant draft that exists exists because I think that I'm done, and though it feels polished to me,

17:39.106 --> 17:45.855
perhaps when I send it in, they say, gee, this doesn't really work.

17:45.875 --> 17:55.329
And so then, well, I have to go through, you know, the heartache of realizing that I'm going to have to go back in and do more work.

17:55.809 --> 18:00.936
And once I get past that, I go back in and I do the more work, you know.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.318
You mentioned the wife and kids.

18:02.338 --> 18:08.267
Just for biographical purposes, did you name your wife and the children and how old they are?

18:08.287 --> 18:08.607
Sure.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.684
My wife's name is Michelle Simons.

18:12.044 --> 18:13.526
S-I-M-O-S.

18:13.546 --> 18:13.867
Right.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.770
Michelle, M-I-C-H-E-L-L-E.

18:15.870 --> 18:16.390
That's right.

18:17.372 --> 18:19.014
And we have two kids.

18:19.114 --> 18:22.399
We've been married for, I think, 16 years.

18:22.439 --> 18:29.148
We have two kids, Catherine, who... With a K. Catherine with a K, and I really do have to spell this for you.

18:29.168 --> 18:32.913
It's K-A-T-H-A-R-I-N-E.

18:33.053 --> 18:33.674
Like Hepburn?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.096
Yes, like Hepburn.

18:35.757 --> 18:37.179
And she's 12.

18:37.239 --> 18:38.020
She's 12.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.163
And I have a son, Sam.

18:40.864 --> 18:41.865
Samuel is Sam.

18:42.486 --> 18:44.870
Well, his name is Samuel, but we call him Sam.

18:45.931 --> 18:47.313
Sometimes I call him Shmooey.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.798
And he is seven.

18:51.219 --> 18:53.062
And the Dalmatian is rugby.

18:53.082 --> 18:55.545
That's right.

18:55.565 --> 18:57.268
And your wife's a writer, I think you said.

18:57.288 --> 18:58.189
My wife is a writer.

18:58.249 --> 19:00.172
She was a poet for a number of years.

19:00.933 --> 19:07.483
She never published a book of poetry, but she published individual poems a lot.

19:08.003 --> 19:16.934
She sort of went away from writing poetry for a number of years, and now she is completing her first novel.

19:18.396 --> 19:20.359
And you met her, I think, in school someplace?

19:20.379 --> 19:24.424
We met at Goddard in graduate school, yeah.

19:24.444 --> 19:26.386
And what are you working on now?

19:27.248 --> 19:33.876
Well, I'm working on working on something, and I'm trying to get something new started.

19:34.227 --> 19:36.470
Do you have a contract?

19:36.490 --> 19:38.172
No, I don't have a contract for a new book.

19:38.873 --> 19:42.337
I like to get something going before I ask for a contract.

19:42.577 --> 19:45.281
That's not like a two-book contract.

19:45.301 --> 19:45.361
No.

19:45.561 --> 19:45.842
Yeah.

19:46.863 --> 19:50.828
I mean, my rule so far has been 100 pages, and then I sell it.

19:51.769 --> 19:51.929
Wow.

19:52.149 --> 20:02.142
I may run out of money this time around and may have to try to get some money from somebody before I have 100 pages.

20:02.729 --> 20:15.529
But it's been a hard time to try to get something going because in addition to the insanity of being about to publish the book, we are also moving.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.075
The rule, what, this 100 pages?

20:19.435 --> 20:22.520
Did you apply this for the first book as well?

20:22.700 --> 20:24.403
No, the first book I had to write the whole thing.

20:24.463 --> 20:27.768
Obviously, but that was completed work.

20:27.868 --> 20:28.169
Yes.

20:28.329 --> 20:30.272
And then starting with the second book,

20:31.147 --> 20:35.552
The School for the Blind, I waited until I had a hundred pages before I sold it.

20:35.812 --> 20:41.018
And with a face at the window, I waited until I had a hundred pages before I sold it.

20:41.038 --> 20:41.238
Good.

20:42.079 --> 20:43.280
Yeah.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.282
Have I missed anything that you can think of?

20:47.605 --> 20:50.288
There's a question I always like.

20:50.368 --> 20:58.116
I mean, because it's three novels, do you see yourself as creating a corpus of work?

20:59.345 --> 21:18.792
Maybe in Gordimer once, when I interviewed her once, she said that her work she sees is like, she compares it to going in and looking at a sculpture, and there's one sculpture in the middle of the room, which for her, every book is like walking around and looking at it from a different angle and seeing different things.

21:19.373 --> 21:24.119
And I guess the suggestion is it's all one big thing, looking at it from different angles.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.062
Maybe that applies to her.

21:26.362 --> 21:28.305
Does something like that apply to you?

21:29.095 --> 21:32.078
Well, it doesn't feel to me like that it applies to me yet.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.202
First of all, every book in your mind is completely different.

21:36.222 --> 21:37.443
No, it doesn't mean that.

21:37.523 --> 21:40.526
It doesn't mean to me that every book is different.

21:40.626 --> 21:43.468
I see that there are recurrent themes in the work.

21:43.528 --> 21:44.589
I can already see that.

21:45.010 --> 21:57.201
The simple truth for me is that I don't feel like three books is enough yet for me to be thinking in terms of a corpus.

21:57.942 --> 21:58.242
It just

21:59.369 --> 22:02.935
So while I'm sort of... Presumptuous, perhaps.

22:03.235 --> 22:05.879
Yeah, it feels a little presumptuous to me.

22:06.761 --> 22:09.966
I don't take myself very seriously in those ways at this point.

22:10.086 --> 22:11.608
And whether I ever will, I don't know.

22:11.728 --> 22:20.502
But though I'm aware of recurrent themes and so on and so forth, I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about that.

22:21.203 --> 22:23.367
I haven't read the books, for example.

22:23.387 --> 22:23.487
Yeah.

22:23.787 --> 22:26.050
I haven't gone back and re-read The Music Room.

22:26.371 --> 22:26.691
Really?

22:26.711 --> 22:30.677
I haven't gone back and re-read School for the Blind since I finished writing them.

22:31.278 --> 22:33.461
So, you know, it's just not a way that I'm spending my time.

22:33.481 --> 22:33.921
But I am, yeah.

22:33.941 --> 22:36.826
Yeah, you know, I mean, someday I may feel inclined to do that.

22:36.886 --> 22:45.899
I have to say with my own book, it was really something that, I forget why, but I wound up reading two or three chapters a couple weeks ago.

22:45.919 --> 22:46.319
Yeah, right.

22:46.339 --> 22:47.921
And I'm talking to one all the time.

22:48.142 --> 22:48.342
Uh-huh.

22:48.362 --> 22:50.806
And I was looking for something, and I said, gee, this is pretty good.

22:50.966 --> 22:52.528
But it had been like a year and a half,

22:52.745 --> 22:53.847
It's like, let it, you know.

22:53.927 --> 22:54.187
Right.

22:54.508 --> 22:56.631
But, you know, you know it so intimately.

22:56.731 --> 22:59.054
I mean, the point where you can almost recite it.

22:59.074 --> 22:59.375
Yeah.

22:59.435 --> 23:00.697
Why go back and read something?

23:00.737 --> 23:04.462
But when you do, I guess you are kind of a little bit surprised.

23:04.482 --> 23:04.622
Yeah.

23:04.642 --> 23:06.265
Well, I think that that's part of it.

23:06.305 --> 23:13.756
I mean, for me, you know, I'm aware, for example, that in my memory, I am gradually forgetting the music room.

23:14.817 --> 23:19.784
You know, there's less and less of it that I can literally remember.

23:20.105 --> 23:20.506
Really?

23:20.526 --> 23:20.846
Yeah.

23:21.307 --> 23:22.228
And so...

23:23.153 --> 23:26.177
At the point that I have, I mean, it's just like a movie.

23:26.257 --> 23:36.150
I mean, you know, I see a movie, and I love a movie, and somewhere down the line, I realize that, gee, I think I like that movie, but I don't remember it.

23:36.170 --> 23:37.952
Then I would be interested in seeing it again.

23:37.972 --> 23:39.735
Which we do often.

23:39.755 --> 23:40.576
Yes, exactly.

23:40.616 --> 23:47.144
So that's the way I feel about the music room, is when I have sufficiently forgotten it, it might be interesting to me to read it.

23:47.265 --> 23:50.629
And even beyond the title, of course, your background,

23:57.443 --> 23:58.244
Yeah.

23:59.866 --> 24:06.735
I think so, though again I'm not sure how much of that was conscious at the time and how much of it was unconscious.

24:07.956 --> 24:12.662
But surely I was influenced by my education in composition.

24:13.583 --> 24:21.493
Probably still am.

24:26.401 --> 24:27.943
that you didn't read a lot growing up?

24:28.824 --> 24:30.986
I didn't read a lot growing up, and I still don't read a lot.

24:31.607 --> 24:32.568
I'm just not a reader.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.191
You know, I'm not one of those people.

24:35.211 --> 24:36.692
I'm not like you.

24:36.712 --> 24:45.782
I could never write a book called, you know, on bibliomania, because it's not something I experienced.

24:45.862 --> 24:47.644
It took eight years of research, too.

24:47.664 --> 24:48.165
Yeah, right.

24:48.545 --> 24:51.008
But, you know, I'm not, that's not something that I,

24:51.865 --> 25:21.045
I'm proud of I would have it otherwise I really would I feel like I'd be a better writer if I read more but it doesn't come easy to me reading and you're a slow reader I'm a slow reader and the concept of reading for pleasure is not a concept that I grasp when I'm reading for some reason it feels like work and it's hard for me to sit still with it for long periods of time

25:21.683 --> 25:23.686
I feel a little restless when I read.

25:24.687 --> 25:32.379
And so I don't know what all the reasons for that are, that reading is difficult for me.

25:32.980 --> 25:38.247
But it remains difficult for me, and that's why I don't read a lot.

25:38.588 --> 25:39.509
And I wish I read more.

25:39.850 --> 25:46.219
And I notice in all three of the books, you do have acknowledgments, you thank people.

25:46.539 --> 25:47.020
Yeah.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.502
And a lot of people are the same people.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.425
Yeah.

25:53.003 --> 25:56.788
or is this basically for informational kind of thing?

25:56.808 --> 25:59.291
No, the only person I show my work to is my wife.

26:00.753 --> 26:10.925
She's my first and only critic, editor, and then I turn it in to my real editor, and that's it.

26:10.945 --> 26:11.946
And deal with it from there.

26:11.966 --> 26:20.777
Yeah, no, the people that I acknowledge and that I thank in my books are people who have helped me with information that I needed and things like that.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.099
In some cases...

26:22.433 --> 26:26.719
People gave me a place to work, you know, when I needed to get away for a few days.

26:26.759 --> 26:37.473
And then, you know, the reason people crop up more than once is because, you know, my lawyer friend, when I have a legal question, that's who I call up, you know.

26:37.493 --> 26:39.376
There's a detective in there or something.

26:39.396 --> 26:40.137
Yeah, you know.

26:40.657 --> 26:48.508
So there are people I call up for medical questions and people I call up for legal questions and things like that.

26:59.744 --> 27:00.740
quotes with you too.

27:01.065 --> 27:01.654
Thank you.
