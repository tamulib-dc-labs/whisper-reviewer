WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:13.967
I don't remember what I was saying, but... Twenty-four something... Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:13.987 --> 00:31.405
Twenty-four dots over, laid over the small, over a millimeter, which is what 600 DPI scanning represents, was sufficient to render that with full fidelity, including the type font, the serif, the thick and thin lines,

00:31.537 --> 00:46.795
Particularly as you move beyond the Roman alphabet, you look at Japanese or Chinese, where characters have to stand by themselves and they are comprised of varying strokes and light and dark.

00:47.535 --> 00:52.882
And you can't figure stuff out in context, it has to be understood by itself.

00:52.902 --> 00:58.388
But it was really important to have enough resolution to capture that detail.

00:59.633 --> 01:23.464
After this assessment, we concluded that 600 DPI bi-tonal scanning, black and white scanning, was sufficient to capture 99.9% of the text-based information contained in commercially published books during this period of brittle paper.

01:24.153 --> 01:35.783
confirmed those calculations based on visual assessments of paper printouts derived from those digital files.

01:39.447 --> 01:52.438
We feel pretty confident about the kind of quality and the ability to offer a replacement quality for text and line art.

01:52.773 --> 02:17.957
As you move beyond that to look at the illustrated book, graphic, you know, the intaglio relief and planigraphic processes, it becomes more complicated, and it's an area of inquiry that I want to pursue, which is to look at what are the attributes of an etching and an engraving and a halftone and an aquatint that are critical.

02:17.977 --> 02:21.480
Well, are such books being disposed of after they've been scanned?

02:21.916 --> 02:26.001
with engravings, with art, with illustrations?

02:26.021 --> 02:31.627
Commercially published stuff, like 19th century serial stuff.

02:32.668 --> 02:41.418
But whether it's an offset or not, the image itself still has the attributes of what was creating the original, the process.

02:41.618 --> 02:45.522
It reflects at the tell-tale signs of the process.

02:46.223 --> 02:49.847
The gouge of a woodcut,

02:50.823 --> 02:54.167
tell-tale lace effect of an aquatint.

02:54.688 --> 02:58.453
How much of that needs to be represented in the digital file itself?

02:58.633 --> 03:01.857
We're still pursuing a line of investigation on that.

03:02.398 --> 03:05.522
And we've identified three levels of perception.

03:06.283 --> 03:11.509
One is what we call essence, for a better word, which is what I see at normal viewing distance.

03:12.911 --> 03:19.159
And does this tend to replicate in printed form what I see from the original?

03:19.848 --> 03:34.649
Beyond that is detail, which is what was intended by the artist for me to see if I hold it up close or look at it under something modest magnification, such as 5X magnification.

03:35.431 --> 03:41.379
And then below that is production, the production process used to create the original.

03:43.042 --> 03:48.910
The black lace of an aquatint is only visible under 27X magnification.

03:50.020 --> 04:01.038
I might say, ah, that looks like an aquatint, but I can't really distinguish an aquatint from some other kind of process without doing that microscopic kind of examination.

04:01.439 --> 04:05.666
And must the digital file represent that information fully?

04:06.287 --> 04:11.676
If it has to, you're upping your requirements for conversion tremendously.

04:12.056 --> 04:16.804
So it's trying to align what information is present

04:17.307 --> 04:25.636
a definition of what is significant in that information, and how does it translate into digital reformatting requirements.

04:25.997 --> 04:29.040
And that's a process we've been working through.

04:29.561 --> 04:35.107
We call the process of trying to match those variables benchmarking.

04:35.127 --> 04:36.628
Essence is just one level.

04:37.389 --> 04:44.958
Essence, detail, and the process or structure.

04:44.978 --> 04:46.099
If you're doing studies,

04:46.265 --> 04:47.406
We're doing studies.

04:48.407 --> 04:56.457
For printed text, those three levels can be obtained at 600 DPI scanning.

04:56.477 --> 05:00.682
We can... Yeah, just DPS things.

05:02.944 --> 05:03.385
DPI.

05:03.685 --> 05:04.947
DPI, so that's... Dots print.

05:04.967 --> 05:05.588
Dots print.

05:05.928 --> 05:08.331
Yeah, it's the resolution.

05:08.351 --> 05:09.852
Which we have on our screen.

05:09.872 --> 05:12.676
Yeah, yeah, well, that's right.

05:12.876 --> 05:14.338
They're different.

05:14.418 --> 05:14.618
Excellent.

05:15.205 --> 05:17.589
They're sort of relational more than anything else.

05:17.609 --> 05:21.336
Just for the sake of my transcription.

05:21.356 --> 05:38.766
So we feel confident about creating preservation quality replacements that meet or exceed those criteria we've defined for either microfilming it or creating preservation photocopies for material that is on a

05:39.252 --> 05:41.115
slow decline anyway.

05:41.495 --> 05:43.138
Are they formulated?

05:43.518 --> 05:45.861
Are they codified?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.445
Do you have a code that sets out the criteria?

05:48.545 --> 05:53.072
We have formulas, and I will give you a copy of our benchmarking tutorial.

05:53.232 --> 05:56.376
I would really appreciate that.

05:56.436 --> 06:00.262
Can I ask you a question?

06:00.282 --> 06:00.382
Sure.

06:00.582 --> 06:08.213
I've heard that there are studies conducted maybe even at MIT that I get to see the results, but

06:09.053 --> 06:16.602
A text read on a screen is different to the reader than it is in a book.

06:16.922 --> 06:19.025
Do you remember that?

06:19.185 --> 06:21.488
Are there studies to try and determine?

06:21.588 --> 06:27.695
I realize this gets into a non-scientific area here.

06:29.437 --> 06:36.546
Has there been any work done to indicate whether or not there's a different perception from text?

06:37.167 --> 06:40.051
I'm sure there's a different perception of text on it.

06:40.071 --> 06:42.675
I know as a writer, it's something I write here.

06:44.237 --> 06:49.925
I have a sense of what it's going to look like when it's written in the newspaper.

06:49.945 --> 06:50.786
And it's different.

06:50.826 --> 06:54.612
That's the way I visualize it in writing.

06:54.712 --> 06:57.696
It's different from what it is.

06:57.716 --> 07:02.163
And part of that is a translation that needs to take place.

07:02.203 --> 07:05.908
You become a connoisseur.

07:06.698 --> 07:09.702
of making that translation.

07:10.363 --> 07:17.374
It's like when you look at art, you know, well that looks good, that looks good, but how do you distinguish between a Picasso and what my son does?

07:17.454 --> 07:28.470
Now, I think my son's better than Picasso, but you know what I mean, it's becoming the connoisseur of it, and making those

07:31.488 --> 07:37.076
We can't presume that all readers approach the text in a uniform manner.

07:38.077 --> 07:47.170
I may not care about any of the visual clues associated with the basic information I want to get off of that page.

07:47.690 --> 07:52.036
Whether it's a newspaper or a printout, it doesn't matter to me.

07:52.317 --> 07:57.023
In some context, all I want to know is, what's this information?

07:58.555 --> 08:06.086
But there are several levels, you see, and that's why they say the information age is nothing more than that.

08:06.106 --> 08:16.081
I mean, the information gets at higher levels, though, to acknowledge and... Oh, yeah, but my knowledge is informed by the information that I collect.

08:16.462 --> 08:26.757
And collecting it off something like this, as opposed to this, as opposed to that, may or may not make a difference to me.

08:26.787 --> 08:29.892
I was, you know, I'm a book person.

08:29.972 --> 08:31.815
I grew up with books.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.398
I don't like TV.

08:33.598 --> 08:36.002
I don't like the medium of comics.

08:36.903 --> 08:38.446
You know, the stupid balloons.

08:39.007 --> 08:41.491
Those things don't mean things to me.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.015
This means things to me.

08:44.035 --> 08:46.659
But, you know, you look at comic stores.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.365
They're all young boys and grown-up boys.

08:50.699 --> 08:52.041
in comic book stores.

08:52.221 --> 08:57.968
Part of it, I think, is the content of the comics, and part of it is the way it's delivered.

08:57.988 --> 09:00.652
I think it appeals to a male kind of mind.

09:00.672 --> 09:01.633
I don't know.

09:01.653 --> 09:04.376
I think that would be an interesting study.

09:04.396 --> 09:10.904
But as you look at... Not nearly as much as boys do.

09:11.305 --> 09:16.892
You go to these comic book stores, and 70% of the clientele are boys.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.803
And I think it's not just the content.

09:20.843 --> 09:24.206
I think it is the way it's delivered.

09:24.807 --> 09:25.127
Interesting.

09:25.668 --> 09:33.335
At any rate, I'll give you a little story about my son who is now eight.

09:33.816 --> 09:39.141
We bought an IBM Selectric typewriter here probably ten years ago.

09:39.241 --> 09:41.003
We paid $500 for it.

09:41.343 --> 09:42.865
We kept it for five years.

09:43.105 --> 09:45.587
I bought it for $5 from Cornell.

09:46.428 --> 09:47.149
Took it home.

09:49.323 --> 09:54.568
You know, it sat in a closet until Michael one day said, you know, how does this thing work?

09:54.588 --> 10:02.535
Took it out, rolled a piece of paper in for him, showed him how the power space bar goes and the automatic return and all the bells.

10:03.616 --> 10:11.923
He typed for a while, and then he looked up at me and he said, where's the screen?

10:11.943 --> 10:12.663
He wasn't.

10:13.204 --> 10:17.828
The idea of stuff coming out on paper didn't compute with him.

10:18.213 --> 10:30.186
He was interested in, you know, maybe his way of getting information, by the time he reaches college, will be so attentive to this as opposed to this.

10:32.749 --> 10:33.389
Interesting.

10:33.770 --> 10:36.353
Yeah.

10:37.454 --> 10:42.159
It was like, oh, my God.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.001
I know.

10:44.217 --> 10:46.780
Because I had very little tolerance for the screen.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.184
You know, I actually couldn't really need help.

10:50.204 --> 10:52.727
But on my own the door, there's a bridge.

10:53.588 --> 10:57.432
You know, I've actually called her if I'm right up to call her.

10:57.452 --> 10:58.814
I need your own paper.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.116
I can't turn the TV on at our house.

11:01.336 --> 11:03.138
Michael has to do it.

11:03.219 --> 11:04.900
There's too many of those things.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.444
I mean, we have four of those universals.

11:08.845 --> 11:10.727
None of them works.

11:10.747 --> 11:13.330
Yes, well, yes.

11:14.373 --> 11:19.981
But what I do use that form is to locate information.

11:20.762 --> 11:29.094
And I think in some ways, as we look at digital libraries, we're not providing a replacement for this.

11:29.114 --> 11:37.005
We're providing a fast way to conduct our research.

11:37.025 --> 11:40.970
The first stage of research isn't looking at what you want.

11:41.090 --> 11:43.654
It's getting rid of the stuff you don't want as far as you can.

11:44.090 --> 11:44.991
That's right.

11:45.011 --> 12:14.097
I mean, when I'm interested in winnowing out the six million volumes, I don't want the floor to start focusing on the ten volumes I do want.

12:17.232 --> 12:27.651
And even though you're making your judgment on those folks.

12:27.791 --> 12:39.493
Right.

12:40.081 --> 12:44.788
And even when you get to the text itself, you browse, you make decisions.

12:44.868 --> 12:50.136
I mean, you talk to... Well, you see rocks at the bottom of it, you know.

12:50.376 --> 12:59.790
And what this does is provide a way of extending the process you do now to looking up for the text itself.

12:59.910 --> 13:03.095
There's a lot of time to read there, so you just copy it.

13:03.115 --> 13:03.736
That's right.

13:03.756 --> 13:05.518
Take it all, and then I'll do this.

13:05.779 --> 13:06.680
I follow the tricks.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.962
That's why I read it right now.

13:08.768 --> 13:13.274
And then we'll have time to sit there and read the whole project.

13:13.294 --> 13:13.454
Exactly.

13:13.634 --> 13:16.638
So with this copy, I go with tons of folders.

13:17.299 --> 13:17.780
Exactly.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.661
And I do more work.

13:18.681 --> 13:21.865
And I come home with maybe 15 books.

13:22.045 --> 13:24.989
That's a two or three hours work.

13:25.750 --> 13:31.557
And the digital library will allow you to do that from your desktop, presumably.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.441
So you will say, aha, this is the stuff I want.

13:34.461 --> 13:35.022
You take it.

13:35.142 --> 13:36.764
You dump it to disk.

13:36.784 --> 13:37.645
You print it out.

13:38.637 --> 13:56.378
Or maybe you've done your first sort, and you're now down to 50 books, and you need a little more time to make the second sort to get down to the 10 books that you've been printed, or whatever, you know, the process is for the sections that you want.

13:57.900 --> 14:03.126
So I don't see this as replacing for anybody above 10.

14:03.933 --> 14:09.141
what we do ultimately with looking at the printed page.

14:13.206 --> 14:27.046
But I'm really worried about digital library development where we don't focus on what the printed page conveys in creating those digital circuits.

14:27.227 --> 14:32.995
A lot of projects have just been so unmannered by the technology

14:33.717 --> 14:35.319
whatever it was like.

14:35.339 --> 14:44.251
I really worried about digital library initiatives that don't pay enough respect to what is conveyed by the printed page.

14:44.892 --> 15:02.796
And so there's such a desire to do it that there isn't enough planning and conceptualization about what's involved in creating something that has value and utility

15:03.113 --> 15:10.701
and can meet the needs that you claim that are easy to make about what you're going to deliver.

15:11.843 --> 15:23.295
I mean, any darn fool who goes in and starts scanning oversize color maps with fine detail and promises that they're going to deliver something to the desktop that the user wants.

15:24.877 --> 15:25.678
Check it out.

15:25.844 --> 15:50.278
Yeah, and the cost associated with grass and the ability to do different silver.

15:50.859 --> 15:54.484
And I could do a full-faring cooler fish.

15:54.835 --> 16:15.257
that will have more information than a file that I would create for that same object, a 1.34 gigabyte file, 134 floppy disks, to have the same kind of information that a full-time fiche could provide me for some of that material.

16:15.477 --> 16:22.665
I'd create the full-time fiche, and then get a digital derivative from it for current use, and go back to this as they

16:22.915 --> 16:40.397
So it's a process of trying to merge the content to the capabilities and to create stuff that has real memory.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.660
Are you going to show us some stuff?

16:42.680 --> 16:44.082
I'm going to show you some stuff.

16:44.102 --> 16:47.286
There's one other thing about it.

16:48.886 --> 16:53.815
So while our focus has been on conversion, we're also very concerned about what is delivered to the user.

16:54.537 --> 16:59.045
And we are not enfranchising the world and creating digital libraries.

16:59.506 --> 17:01.690
Those on modems will be very frustrated.

17:01.750 --> 17:12.210
Those with 386s will not be able to display the kind of color that the digital file could represent beautifully if you had the proper technical links in the chain.

17:12.528 --> 17:14.891
Seth's point, it's mad.

17:15.251 --> 17:19.437
And, you know, the good news is, three basics won't be working in two years anyway.

17:19.537 --> 17:23.582
Yeah, three basics is, uh, which I love my book on birth, uh, great, that's so funny.

17:23.602 --> 17:27.927
I mean, Toshiba 720, all that stuff up here.

17:28.308 --> 17:28.508
Mm-hmm.

17:28.528 --> 17:34.015
I love that, uh, one for my kids, which we saw, you know, two computers that I had to go in my life.

17:34.035 --> 17:34.736
That's right.

17:34.796 --> 17:39.101
Three basics was, uh, so if we had the entire financial world, huh?

17:39.121 --> 17:39.361
Mm-hmm.

17:39.401 --> 17:41.744
You know, you know, we had six basics.

17:41.764 --> 17:42.265
That's right.

17:43.105 --> 17:47.671
So, um, let's show you a little bit.

17:48.371 --> 17:53.838
...that we can kind of look to.

17:56.121 --> 18:08.095
I think Cornell has been a leader in trying to make some guidelines here on how to capture stuff.

18:08.115 --> 18:11.880
Uh... We are now... We are... This is, um...

18:12.282 --> 18:16.806
My colleague's office.

18:16.826 --> 18:17.447
I see.

18:17.707 --> 18:22.111
This is the kind of comedy that we have produced.

18:22.131 --> 18:25.374
That's actually... It's a digital facsimile.

18:25.554 --> 18:31.499
And the title is Astronomy for All by B-U-R-G-E-L.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.843
This looks like a regular book, doesn't it, huh?

18:35.863 --> 18:38.205
Yeah.

18:38.225 --> 18:39.226
And you've done this right here?

18:39.627 --> 18:39.927
Yep.

18:40.379 --> 18:57.875
Cassell & Company, C-A-S-S-E-L-L, London, New York, 1911, by Bruno H-B-U-I, a little bit loud about the U. The illustration could be a little better, but maybe that's how it was in the original book, right?

18:57.935 --> 19:02.360
Where does it say Cornell here, that you did this?

19:02.380 --> 19:03.120
