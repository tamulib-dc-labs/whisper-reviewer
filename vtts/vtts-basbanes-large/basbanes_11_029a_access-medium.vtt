WEBVTT

00:03.541 --> 00:06.666
So we're recording right now.

00:07.847 --> 00:08.989
I'm all set, thank you.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.875
So if you just say who's talking, say, this is Alaa.

00:13.095 --> 00:13.836
This is Alaa, yes.

00:13.856 --> 00:15.979
This is Alaa.

00:17.361 --> 00:18.323
Okay, this is Alaa.

00:18.343 --> 00:24.171
I'm an architect here in the construction monitoring unit of the project of Lutteca Alexandrina.

00:27.096 --> 00:32.704
In the beginning, I want to tell you about some point of view in the site.

00:33.376 --> 00:43.592
Can you stop it for a moment?

00:43.653 --> 00:52.667
I want to thank you.

00:54.166 --> 00:56.608
Help me when I listen, so don't worry about the pictures.

00:56.648 --> 00:59.651
So I don't have to spend my time taking notes.

00:59.871 --> 01:00.672
Okay, no problem.

01:00.692 --> 01:03.094
And I have a record of it here, so I can go back to it.

01:03.114 --> 01:04.115
Okay.

01:04.195 --> 01:08.439
Now we have the project area consists of three main buildings.

01:09.560 --> 01:15.126
The first building is a library building, which is shaped like a circular.

01:15.206 --> 01:15.846
Okay?

01:16.347 --> 01:17.047
Something like that.

01:19.310 --> 01:19.650
Okay?

01:19.930 --> 01:21.912
Second building is the planetarium.

01:24.355 --> 01:28.440
Yes, it has a spherical shape like that.

01:28.460 --> 01:32.845
And the third building is the conference center, which is already existing here.

01:32.865 --> 01:34.106
Which I entered, yes.

01:34.307 --> 01:35.948
Yes, you have visited it already?

01:35.968 --> 01:37.991
I didn't visit, I just entered it.

01:38.011 --> 01:38.812
I walked into it.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.635
Yes, okay.

01:41.735 --> 01:52.928
And we have another separate element, which is a footbridge, called the Esterian Bridge, coming like that, coming from the university in the back,

01:53.330 --> 01:54.471
Universities here?

01:54.531 --> 01:55.412
Yes, Universities here.

01:55.592 --> 01:57.374
The University of Alexandria.

01:57.434 --> 01:59.836
Yes, of Alexandria, yes.

01:59.856 --> 02:04.560
Faculty of Commercial and Faculty of Science, Faculty of Science.

02:05.100 --> 02:05.521
Okay?

02:05.541 --> 02:07.282
Faculty of Education.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.668
The bridge coming through the building.

02:14.609 --> 02:17.151
Okay?

02:17.231 --> 02:19.253
Parallel to the conference center.

02:19.713 --> 02:20.093
Okay?

02:21.375 --> 02:23.016
Going to the Eastern Harbor.

02:24.228 --> 02:32.736
Here, here is the scene, yes.

02:32.756 --> 02:32.936
Go ahead.

02:33.437 --> 02:33.657
Yes.

02:36.019 --> 02:37.721
The idea of the zen is new.

02:38.241 --> 02:46.309
This library, the zen of the library itself has a strip in the middle here.

02:46.689 --> 02:51.754
This is called school area, with the toilets, elevators,

02:52.072 --> 02:54.175
What is it called again?

02:54.315 --> 02:55.416
What is that word?

02:55.436 --> 02:55.677
Core area.

02:55.797 --> 02:56.117
Core?

02:56.418 --> 02:57.439
Yes, core.

02:57.479 --> 02:58.901
Or the heart, the spine of the building.

02:58.941 --> 03:00.082
The heart of the building.

03:00.202 --> 03:00.282
Yes.

03:00.302 --> 03:01.464
The surface area.

03:01.824 --> 03:03.467
How do you spell that word?

03:03.707 --> 03:04.268
C-O-R-E.

03:04.528 --> 03:05.008
Oh, core.

03:05.269 --> 03:05.609
Core.

03:05.629 --> 03:06.510
Okay, core.

03:06.530 --> 03:06.911
I'm sorry.

03:07.011 --> 03:07.331
Yeah.

03:08.092 --> 03:08.253
Core.

03:09.334 --> 03:09.514
Core.

03:11.777 --> 03:12.478
Yes, okay.

03:12.578 --> 03:12.899
Okay.

03:15.121 --> 03:19.547
That area, for readers area, and for

03:20.033 --> 03:21.615
This is one space, yes.

03:22.115 --> 03:33.506
When we make a section in that area like that, okay, it's like different floors, shaped like that.

03:34.587 --> 03:36.028
And I will see this when we walk through?

03:36.048 --> 03:36.829
Yes, of course.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.471
We'll try to see it, okay?

03:38.771 --> 03:40.873
Here, it's like a balconies.

03:42.294 --> 03:47.179
The man can stand here, can stand in the edges, okay?

03:47.199 --> 03:48.100
And in that one,

03:48.434 --> 04:15.808
this is a reader or reading area in the back this is the storage that area already exposed to the roof which has the indirect light coming from the sun something like that okay for all the reading or the reading area it's okay you got the idea of the building that the reading area is like an amphitheater

04:18.303 --> 04:46.268
yeah has many balconies the one in the top can see the one in the bottom okay yes the overlap between floors it's a storage area storage of books storage of books yes book storage area yes okay let's go to the other side of the building here you'll find the closed rooms okay just for administrations for

04:47.176 --> 05:15.613
translations offices or professor's offices it's a closed room like that like we are black okay here this is a design let's go outside and see exactly what is going on in the site and i'll show excellent two stages first stage for foundation second stage for

05:17.618 --> 05:25.187
Like you see here in the picture, you'll find the first part is May 95.

05:25.207 --> 05:29.413
It was gathering and parking.

05:29.433 --> 05:37.242
Here in June 95, some of the excavations were started, some equipment next month.

05:38.223 --> 05:45.212
Here more equipment, some of the sea parks appeared in the picture, and you'll find here this

05:46.576 --> 05:48.178
some of the boundaries of the building.

05:48.238 --> 05:54.867
Here's also some enforcement, some digging and civilization work.

05:54.887 --> 06:06.042
And here, in that picture, you'll find a big farm wall surrounding the building to protect it from water pressure coming from the sea.

06:06.823 --> 06:12.010
And here you'll find 600 piles at the foundation for the building.

06:14.858 --> 06:16.159
Do you have a firm footing?

06:16.239 --> 06:17.921
Is it rocked down below?

06:17.961 --> 06:18.902
Yes, yes.

06:18.922 --> 06:22.365
40 meters below the sea level.

06:23.326 --> 06:27.691
All these foundations come through to hit the petrol.

06:27.711 --> 06:30.874
More than... Around 40 meters.

06:30.894 --> 06:32.635
How much poured concrete, do you know?

06:34.037 --> 06:34.978
It's very hard.

06:35.198 --> 06:37.540
Because this is the first stage.

06:37.560 --> 06:41.004
But look at the arm, we'll tell you about this.

06:41.024 --> 06:43.626
Because we already see it.

06:43.646 --> 06:44.427
Okay, good.

06:44.727 --> 06:52.999
And here we start to make isolation inside the building, okay, and here we start the sourcing.

06:53.079 --> 07:02.453
The end of 32 December 96, just the dowels and steel parts coming through the foundation to start the sourcing.

07:02.814 --> 07:03.775
Okay?

07:03.795 --> 07:05.358
Let's go inside the building.

07:06.319 --> 07:08.983
So the project starts in December of 95.

07:09.103 --> 07:12.368
That's where construction begins.

07:12.428 --> 07:14.211
The 32nd stage ended.

07:14.562 --> 07:16.204
December 96.

07:16.224 --> 07:18.286
But it started in December.

07:18.386 --> 07:19.287
May 95.

07:19.707 --> 07:25.233
May 95.

07:36.945 --> 07:38.287
Oh, my hat.

07:38.928 --> 07:39.708
No problem.

07:39.728 --> 07:40.769
Do I need one?

07:40.789 --> 07:40.930
No, no.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.291
Look now.

07:43.469 --> 07:53.280
If you want to see that you see, you can see it from here.

07:53.320 --> 08:00.288
Yes, come over here.

08:00.349 --> 08:10.921
Here, with this perspective, when the roof is off already, we remove the roof here.

08:10.941 --> 08:12.042
We will find the balconies.

08:12.427 --> 08:16.512
This is the edges of the balconies.

08:16.532 --> 08:18.414
This one is the reading area.

08:19.075 --> 08:23.340
The one underneath is the book storage area.

08:23.360 --> 08:31.729
And here, there are two balconies for VIP to see the whole space with the library.

08:31.749 --> 08:34.352
On the other side, you'll find the closed area.

08:34.372 --> 08:40.920
The closed area will be the space.

08:41.000 --> 08:41.961
General view from up.

08:42.582 --> 08:52.256
You will see exactly the library spanning from the earth, spanning like that, circular shape, the conference, the planetarium, and this is the footbridge.

08:53.197 --> 09:06.557
The planetarium is for exhibit, for shows, for a style like... Yes, yes, especially for sky, and global and universal details.

09:06.978 --> 09:07.338
Okay.

09:07.358 --> 09:07.999
Okay, let's go outside.

09:11.894 --> 09:40.281
You really think you're going to be done in a year?

09:41.408 --> 09:43.354
Yes, not so.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.782
When do you start the finishing?

09:45.802 --> 09:45.903
Yeah.

09:45.923 --> 09:49.354
You have to start the finishing and then... Can I go to?

09:49.374 --> 09:51.942
Four floors.

10:15.850 --> 10:16.951
He puts 30.

10:17.131 --> 10:17.872
He puts 30.

10:19.574 --> 10:19.914
Wow.

10:20.956 --> 10:21.016
OK?

10:21.116 --> 10:22.277
It's pretty impressive.

10:22.758 --> 10:25.160
Yes, of course.

10:25.180 --> 10:28.844
Like you see here, the roof starts on the fence block already.

10:29.405 --> 10:30.246
This is a canvas.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.409
And we have approved it already.

10:33.429 --> 10:35.331
And we'll start complete.

10:35.812 --> 10:36.433
Go ahead.

10:36.753 --> 10:37.814
I understand.

10:37.914 --> 10:38.535
OK, OK.

10:38.995 --> 10:40.457
We'll start complete the roofing.

10:42.395 --> 10:45.399
The expansion already started down there.

10:45.499 --> 10:46.841
We will check ourselves now.

10:47.201 --> 10:48.483
That's a planetarium already.

10:48.503 --> 10:49.043
That's the point.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.805
Now what is that building over there?

10:50.825 --> 10:52.367
This is the conference center.

10:52.387 --> 10:53.909
That's the conference center.

10:56.533 --> 10:57.974
Like this thing one.

10:57.994 --> 11:09.769
The building here will be surrounded by a reflecting pool or reflected pool from three directions surrounding the building.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.723
Here I can see that they are from wall.

11:14.587 --> 11:15.248
There's one what?

11:15.488 --> 11:16.370
That they are from wall.

11:16.710 --> 11:21.960
That wall surrounding the building is protected from motor pressure.

11:22.020 --> 11:22.641
From the ocean?

11:23.142 --> 11:24.364
From the sea.

11:24.404 --> 11:27.390
From the sea.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.251
From the sea.

11:28.331 --> 11:28.652
See?

11:32.439 --> 11:32.719
Yep.

11:34.673 --> 11:40.228
And the area between the three buildings will be cultural plaza.

11:40.589 --> 11:42.072
It's called cultural plaza.

11:42.273 --> 11:43.195
Cultural plaza.

11:43.356 --> 11:48.750
Where the entrance of the conference center and the entrance

11:49.051 --> 11:56.801
the library entrance to the interior in one place called such a plethora.

11:56.821 --> 11:57.702
See?

11:57.822 --> 12:08.916
Like you see here the plethora, the welding of steel parts and the cladding will come mixed up.

12:13.925 --> 12:19.272
The Arab contractor and style for fetish are working so fast.

12:19.512 --> 12:28.724
And we hope we finish that next summer.

12:28.744 --> 12:28.904
Thanks.

12:28.924 --> 12:32.509
That was the ending, the top of the pageant.

12:32.629 --> 12:33.851
No more construction.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.534
How many books were sold?

12:38.897 --> 12:40.379
This is with Dr. Zahran.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.001
I don't know if that was the administration question.

12:42.021 --> 12:42.262
Yes.

12:43.123 --> 12:43.223
Okay?

12:43.793 --> 12:58.093
But you will find in the brochure, they are written about four million dollars.

12:58.113 --> 12:58.654
That's what I wrote.

12:58.674 --> 12:59.615
Four million dollars.

13:00.076 --> 13:00.937
And we have a plan.

13:02.639 --> 13:07.326
Dr. Zarath put a plan for this project.

13:08.267 --> 13:12.012
I think per year we have to put a certain

13:17.324 --> 13:21.528
We have to collect a certain number of sources.

13:21.548 --> 13:26.753
We'll go down just here and see exactly from the side.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.375
Do I need a hat?

13:28.455 --> 13:29.897
Yes, I'll bring it to you.

13:39.386 --> 13:39.706
Okay, thank you.

13:39.726 --> 13:41.708
So now we're entering... Not all these things.

13:41.728 --> 13:42.789
We'll be under the water.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.211
The level of the water will be here.

13:44.671 --> 13:45.492
I see, yes.

13:45.708 --> 14:11.617
This is the reason you put some kind of foam.

14:11.637 --> 14:12.478
You move the foam and put the socket flat.

14:12.498 --> 14:12.578
Yes.

14:12.598 --> 14:13.139
Oh, this is a nice picture.

14:13.159 --> 14:13.419
This is nice.

14:13.439 --> 14:13.960
This will be stacked area.

14:15.678 --> 14:35.754
Reader, for reader.

14:35.774 --> 14:36.015
Reader area.

14:36.035 --> 14:36.275
Reader area.

14:36.295 --> 14:37.097
And the one... He trans for handicapped.

14:37.117 --> 14:37.197
Yes.

14:52.313 --> 15:08.907
Oh, this is nice.

15:08.927 --> 15:09.168
What's this?

15:09.188 --> 15:11.352
Okay, as you see here, the balconies, one, two, three, three, the leader, and the knees of the college area.

15:17.238 --> 15:29.755
Do me a favor, take a picture of me here.

15:30.576 --> 15:37.987
You push this button to see the green light and then that puts you in focus and then you shoot.

15:38.247 --> 15:40.610
No, no, no, no, leave that alone.

15:40.971 --> 15:46.198
Just push it gently and you'll see a green light and then when you see the green light, shoot the picture.

15:47.157 --> 16:15.088
with the background thank you just to show people that i was in here to prove it well this is a nice this is a great picture right here i do all my own photography

16:23.557 --> 16:51.336
very good thank you you'll imagine how thick it is oh yes it's going to be wonderful these are great pictures because a year from now nobody will be able to get these pictures yes of course yeah within one month maybe we'll know yeah so the development here will be very nice very nice picture from here yes

17:01.559 --> 17:05.993
All these teams, just testing here.

17:06.214 --> 17:10.689
Then using the tower crane, lift it and put it on the collar.

17:11.672 --> 17:11.833
See?

17:12.334 --> 17:12.615
Yeah.

17:46.717 --> 17:53.686
Anything with a question about the construction, I can answer.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.609
I'd love to know how many tons of concrete you've used.

17:56.629 --> 17:56.809
Oh!

17:59.072 --> 18:05.280
You want exactly, exactly... Approximately.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.421
Approximately, okay.

18:06.441 --> 18:15.913
For first four, for first ten, I think, but you have to be sure to look at that, for 80 cubic meters.

18:16.349 --> 18:16.870
Eighty?

18:18.072 --> 18:18.313
Eighty.

18:18.373 --> 18:18.934
Cubic meters?

18:19.074 --> 18:19.314
Yes.

18:21.378 --> 18:23.502
So this is for everything?

18:23.542 --> 18:27.409
This is for first case, foundation.

18:27.429 --> 18:36.966
Second case, which is now, it's about 65 cubic meters.

18:36.986 --> 18:40.112
With the foundation, we put a lot of concrete.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.851
That's a lot, right?

18:45.292 --> 18:49.579
Yes, of course.

18:49.600 --> 18:49.940
65,000.

18:50.000 --> 18:50.421
65,000.

18:50.481 --> 18:51.483
Yes, and 80,000.

18:54.728 --> 18:57.132
Very important.

18:57.152 --> 18:57.593
Yes, of course.

18:57.673 --> 19:05.847
Remind me.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.575
I said, jeez, 80, isn't it?

19:10.016 --> 19:15.365
Maybe this is a new measure unit that I don't know about.

19:15.466 --> 19:15.646
Yes.

19:15.666 --> 19:18.571
The water is going so fast.

19:18.751 --> 19:20.535
It's a little high-tech.

19:21.837 --> 19:23.059
Yes.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.163
And do you have any photographs like this that I can have?

19:43.503 --> 19:44.965
No, you find anything for sure.

19:45.205 --> 19:45.385
Yes.

19:46.546 --> 19:51.111
That I can use for the magazine.

19:52.152 --> 19:52.392
Yes.

19:55.675 --> 19:59.439
Do you know about your coming here and your visit tomorrow?

20:00.380 --> 20:00.580
Yes.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.020
Oh, yes.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.022
This was arranged by the embassy in Washington.

20:03.282 --> 20:03.723
Yeah.

20:03.743 --> 20:08.567
But he got called off to Cairo at the last minute.

20:08.587 --> 20:09.128
So...

20:09.884 --> 20:13.691
At the office, then they called here and then they've arranged for me to see him tomorrow.

20:14.432 --> 20:14.652
Okay, okay.

20:14.672 --> 20:18.319
So, we're doing this today instead of tomorrow.

20:18.339 --> 20:21.965
Maybe he will bring you tomorrow, maybe, because then maybe something you want.

20:22.065 --> 20:22.346
Yeah, sure.

20:22.466 --> 20:23.528
Whatever.

20:24.049 --> 20:25.311
Okay, this is the toilet, you need the toilet.

20:25.331 --> 20:26.292
I'm all set, yes.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.795
Okay, and I'll bring you.

20:27.815 --> 20:28.616
Okay.

20:28.636 --> 20:31.842
And if you could tell me, sure.

20:41.339 --> 20:55.738
Do you want the brochure in English or French?

20:55.758 --> 20:57.881
English, yes.

20:59.223 --> 21:01.345
Yes, we can reproduce that.

21:01.726 --> 21:08.995
Thank you.

21:09.015 --> 21:09.456
Welcome.

21:09.892 --> 21:12.115
Okay, so is that pretty much it, would you say?

21:14.178 --> 21:16.081
What is in the conference center?

21:16.101 --> 21:21.749
Is there anything else you see in the conference center?

21:22.390 --> 21:26.596
The conference center consists of three or four halls.

21:26.616 --> 21:27.437
Four halls.

21:27.518 --> 21:28.319
How many people?

21:28.339 --> 21:30.602
1,700 seats.

21:30.622 --> 21:35.028
The great hall is 1,700 seats.

21:35.048 --> 21:36.230
That has a big stage.

21:37.792 --> 21:39.595
1,700.

21:40.317 --> 21:53.310
It has a big stage that should suit dancing, orchestra, music, plays.

21:53.751 --> 21:56.454
None of the work of the library will be done there.

21:56.494 --> 22:00.918
I mean, the library itself will be in this facility that you just showed me out here.

22:01.058 --> 22:01.559
The books.

22:01.739 --> 22:03.701
It's a conference center.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.683
It's built since many years.

22:06.423 --> 22:08.546
Oh, that's not new?

22:08.566 --> 22:10.249
No, not new.

22:11.692 --> 22:14.777
So what is new is just the library and the planetarium?

22:14.837 --> 22:15.558
Yes.

22:15.578 --> 22:17.341
Like I told you before, three buildings.

22:17.441 --> 22:18.863
The one is already existing.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.548
When was that built?

22:21.848 --> 22:25.654
I think it has a long story.

22:25.674 --> 22:27.658
It started since 20 years ago.

22:27.678 --> 22:32.886
20 years ago, but it started working since 5-6 years.

22:33.322 --> 22:34.243
Something like that.

22:34.263 --> 22:36.486
You say a long story means it took a long time to get it done.

22:36.586 --> 22:37.427
Yes, yes.

22:38.508 --> 22:40.770
I'm an old naval officer.

22:40.830 --> 22:44.775
I know these problems.

22:46.437 --> 22:49.340
Where do we think the original library was?

22:49.360 --> 22:51.222
Are we close to the ancient library?

22:52.544 --> 22:55.487
Like you see here in the map.

22:56.007 --> 22:56.608
Yes.

22:56.748 --> 23:01.894
Here it goes the Royal Court in that area.

23:02.617 --> 23:13.858
The library, the ancient library, it is not in the same location, but somewhere here in this royal coast, but not exactly.

23:14.075 --> 23:16.338
in the same modern library.

23:16.538 --> 23:18.861
Not the exact site but around it.

23:18.881 --> 23:19.602
But nobody knows.

23:19.722 --> 23:20.924
There's no evidence.

23:21.144 --> 23:22.305
There's no archaeological evidence.

23:23.227 --> 23:23.287
No.

23:23.307 --> 23:26.411
But we know exactly somewhere in that world court.

23:26.431 --> 23:28.433
This is all this Alexandria.

23:28.453 --> 23:30.776
Out front here on the ocean there's a statue.

23:31.097 --> 23:33.259
I'm sorry.

23:33.540 --> 23:36.604
It's twice I've known that.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.485
I'm from Massachusetts.

23:37.505 --> 23:39.227
I live in the Atlantic Ocean.

23:39.327 --> 23:40.048
I'm sorry.

23:40.332 --> 23:42.695
What is that area down here?

23:42.715 --> 23:44.757
Is that archaeological excavation?

23:45.038 --> 23:45.939
Yeah.

23:45.979 --> 23:46.860
Is there anything to see here?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.582
If I were to go down there?

23:48.602 --> 23:51.566
I think we will not be able to see anything there.

23:51.586 --> 23:52.647
Yes, it's under the sea.

23:52.987 --> 24:02.879
And I think they brought some monuments from them and it's in the Romanic Museum.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.122
We have here a museum, Alexandrian Museum.

24:05.142 --> 24:09.327
We are about to build a museum initially for the sunking.

24:09.678 --> 24:10.479
Sunken?

24:10.959 --> 24:11.280
Drown?

24:11.300 --> 24:11.460
Yes.

24:11.760 --> 24:12.001
Drown?

24:12.461 --> 24:12.902
Sunken?

24:16.946 --> 24:17.767
I don't know the exact workday.

24:22.933 --> 24:24.274
Oh really? Okay.

24:24.294 --> 24:33.745
They would bring the package from... Leave them here. We have a...for thankfully this.

24:34.028 --> 24:57.268
So if I wanted to, if I've got some time this afternoon, if I wanted to get a feeling, where was the old lighthouse?

24:57.822 --> 25:03.550
the lighthouse lighthouse by the castle of Kaite.

25:03.690 --> 25:05.693
Is there anything to see out there?

25:05.973 --> 25:06.794
If I were to go out there?

25:06.834 --> 25:08.256
You can see it, yes.

25:08.336 --> 25:13.824
If you come outside, I will see exactly the exact location of it.

25:13.844 --> 25:23.577
Because when it's already demolished or destroyed, I think by Ezekiel, they felt a castle.

25:24.181 --> 25:26.404
in the foundation of that lighthouse.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.207
And that's the castle that's on there now?

25:28.227 --> 25:28.587
Yes, yes.

25:28.607 --> 25:29.508
Is this the castle?

25:29.629 --> 25:29.709
Yes.

25:29.829 --> 25:34.856
They use the stones from the lighthouse and put that castle.

25:35.317 --> 25:36.698
Can tourists go out there?

25:36.739 --> 25:37.119
Yes, yes.

25:37.159 --> 25:38.681
Can I take a taxi or something?

25:38.761 --> 25:44.810
Yes, but I think they open up to 13 times, I think up to 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock.

25:44.870 --> 25:45.651
I don't know exactly.

25:45.671 --> 25:46.132
They're closed now.

25:46.472 --> 25:47.674
Well, you can see from outside.

25:47.694 --> 25:48.535
From outside, yes.

25:49.038 --> 25:51.060
There's nothing to see if you go out there.

25:51.420 --> 25:52.761
Go inside.

25:52.781 --> 25:54.363
I'd love to see.

25:54.383 --> 25:57.145
So if I were to go there, I'd get signed.

25:57.165 --> 25:59.327
Go there and check, but I don't know exactly.

25:59.607 --> 26:01.069
Yes.

26:01.549 --> 26:03.371
So I can take a taxi there now?

26:03.391 --> 26:03.951
Yes.

26:04.071 --> 26:04.592
Taxi.

26:05.052 --> 26:06.133
What should I tell the taxi?

26:07.154 --> 26:08.095
Carried by.

26:08.115 --> 26:09.116
Carried by cattle.

26:09.716 --> 26:12.439
They killed a lot of them.

26:12.459 --> 26:14.060
A lot of them.

26:14.481 --> 26:18.184
Give them three pounds or four or five pounds of them.

26:18.940 --> 26:42.130
five pounds good very good enough okay that does not that much but how much to ride around in the city I think the metropole so I'm doing good I think okay just like five back just point it

26:42.582 --> 26:48.818
And that's where the lighthouse was.

26:48.838 --> 26:57.520
There must be a nice view within here where I can get some nice pictures.
