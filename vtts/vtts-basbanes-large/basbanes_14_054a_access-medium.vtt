00:02.107 --> 00:05.704
I believe I'm really working hard at it.

00:06.157 --> 00:07.879
three, four weeks myself.

00:07.979 --> 00:12.305
But I felt very smart because this guy was, you know, really needing help.

00:12.345 --> 00:16.790
So I helped him through his little beginning struggles and so on.

00:17.371 --> 00:21.836
And by the way, the next time I saw him, he was doing some fabulous stuff.

00:22.137 --> 00:23.678
And I watched him.

00:23.699 --> 00:24.960
I said, my God.

00:25.020 --> 00:25.961
First of all, I said, how are you doing?

00:26.001 --> 00:26.462
He said, I'm doing it.

00:26.482 --> 00:27.303
I looked what he was doing.

00:27.403 --> 00:28.144
I couldn't believe it.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.889
And it turned out that he was, he had helped build computers.

00:31.909 --> 00:32.970
He knew everything about it.

00:33.290 --> 00:34.712
He knew it, except

00:34.979 --> 00:36.721
that he didn't know how to log in.

00:36.741 --> 00:39.806
I mean, that's a little thing you have to learn.

00:40.066 --> 00:46.115
And so he became, in a way, a kind of... He taught me a lot of things.

00:46.135 --> 00:47.437
We became friends.

00:47.797 --> 00:53.065
And I got him... He was a Milton scholar in the English grad school.

00:54.006 --> 00:55.368
But he's really interested to lay here.

00:55.468 --> 01:01.797
And I got him appointed as a computer adjunct to the English department.

01:01.777 --> 01:05.022
And he did a lot of important things for us.

01:05.042 --> 01:08.447
And he helped found this IRIS school.

01:09.108 --> 01:15.217
And they developed a hypertext software called Intermedia.

01:15.318 --> 01:21.086
And a professor friend of mine, George Landau, got interested in this stuff.

01:21.427 --> 01:22.989
Landau's famous.

01:23.049 --> 01:23.430
Yeah, yeah.

01:23.470 --> 01:26.755
Well, Landau was involved with IRIS.

01:27.612 --> 01:31.042
helped to develop Intermedia and was the first to use it.

01:31.424 --> 01:40.311
So, in the late 80s, he was urging me to get into it myself and teach a course.

01:40.331 --> 01:40.812
Well,

01:41.230 --> 01:43.892
That was kind of more than I wanted to get involved with.

01:43.992 --> 01:45.874
It looked kind of complicated.

01:45.894 --> 01:47.736
My own, you know, things to do.

01:48.496 --> 01:51.219
And I thought, well, I'll get a student, right?

01:51.499 --> 01:59.806
There was a student who was very keen on getting into it, a grad student, and I wanted to get him a teaching job for a year, teaching a beginning hypertext workshop.

02:00.187 --> 02:00.727
And I failed.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.350
I cried, and he said, no, if you apply for it, it might do well.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.832
We can't do this for a student.

02:05.852 --> 02:07.774
So I went away on a sabbatical.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.596
And I came back, and I had a...

02:10.846 --> 02:11.887
a free course to choose.

02:11.967 --> 02:14.449
I was teaching a workshop and I could teach something else.

02:15.390 --> 02:19.334
I ran into Landau and the course of it was, all right, I'll have a go.

02:19.434 --> 02:23.078
But at this time, I still had never had a mouse in my hand.

02:23.098 --> 02:25.380
I had no idea about these things.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.362
I'd never played with Windows at all.

02:27.422 --> 02:29.684
I was still a DOS user thoroughly.

02:30.585 --> 02:34.248
I'd created my own macros and so on inside DOS, but I had no idea.

02:34.308 --> 02:40.414
I'd never, this is pre-Windows, and I'd never...

02:40.613 --> 02:44.053
dinner on a Mac and just looked over people's shoulders at him.

02:44.073 --> 02:47.755
So I taught, of course, and I taught on Macs, because you had that window.

02:48.443 --> 03:12.814
I got an assistant, a senior undergraduate, who was badgering me to be his undergraduate advisor for his thesis, and I was turning him down, and then we got into his hypertext stuff, and he said, wouldn't you like a TA for that course?

03:12.794 --> 03:16.400
He said, yeah, he had Landau's course, so he made a deal.

03:16.420 --> 03:19.004
I would be his advisor, he'd be my TA.

03:19.504 --> 03:23.050
That fellow is Robert Arellano, who is still there.

03:24.913 --> 03:31.744
Well, Bobby is really, really good, and I've managed over the years to keep finding him.

03:31.764 --> 03:40.337
So he's on a presidential fellowship there now for three years, and teaching my hypertension workshops on the way.

03:40.722 --> 03:45.190
So he was my team.

03:45.250 --> 03:49.458
We had a class, and we had about ten students, brave students, decided to have a go.

03:49.799 --> 03:52.604
They didn't know what this was, and I didn't know what it was.

03:52.684 --> 03:54.948
And there was nothing quite published.

03:54.968 --> 04:01.600
There were a couple of things that Eastgate was producing at that time, but Michael Joyce's afternoon was still handed around to us.

04:02.018 --> 04:06.885
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't, well, I think, in fact, at least it was just about to publish it.

04:07.186 --> 04:11.071
The copy we had was stuff that was, somebody had a copy and they'd pass it around.

04:11.111 --> 04:17.040
So all of the early hypertext fiction was still in the developmental stage.

04:17.581 --> 04:23.750
And there was a group at Brown, which I often went to their meetings, called CHUG, Computers and Humanities Users Group.

04:24.511 --> 04:27.435
And CHUG, CHUG invited...

04:27.770 --> 04:34.642
people to come talk about computer issues and humanities, and library issues very typically, for example.

04:35.183 --> 04:47.005
I was aware of how libraries were changing back in the mid to late 80s, attending those meetings.

04:47.025 --> 04:51.533
And Stuart Malthrop and Michael Joyce, they had been invitees, so I'd seen a bit what they were doing.

04:52.019 --> 04:55.264
and they left stuff behind which I looked at.

04:55.284 --> 04:56.506
So we had some sense of it.

04:56.526 --> 04:57.607
We didn't know really.

04:57.648 --> 05:10.046
I was completely unaware of what would happen and that's what that first piece was based on was that kind of opening experience, opening awareness of how the stuff worked.

05:10.106 --> 05:17.858
I don't confess to my 60s involvement with a similar idea but that's what made it easy so that I was not

05:19.171 --> 05:22.555
I was not surprised at the possibility.

05:22.595 --> 05:26.899
In fact, they looked like enhancements that were attractive.

05:27.019 --> 05:29.022
And just to go back, what did you call that machine?

05:29.042 --> 05:30.323
Did you have a name for that machine?

05:30.663 --> 05:35.789
Well, it was just edge-knots cards, and you used a punch and steel needles.

05:36.089 --> 05:36.470
That's all.

05:36.530 --> 05:39.092
And it was basically an early database?

05:39.153 --> 05:40.033
Yeah, yeah.

05:40.053 --> 05:41.095
It was a database idea.

05:41.135 --> 05:46.140
And in fact, it was a kind of...

05:46.677 --> 05:57.908
hand-punched way of doing what was developing shortly thereafter, in the early 70s, were those computer cards that you'd see.

05:57.969 --> 06:00.831
I don't know if you ever saw the composer's work.

06:00.992 --> 06:13.244
I was at Princeton for a year and got to know Babbitt and all his people there and had this electronic, the Princeton-Columbian electronic music center.

06:13.264 --> 06:15.166
And the computer music was just catching on.

06:15.186 --> 06:16.127
It's a new idea.

06:16.748 --> 06:21.194
But it was done with these immense decks of punched cards.

06:21.274 --> 06:24.458
I mean, immense decks of punched cards to get a little bit of sound.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.920
I mean, it wasn't to get much.

06:25.940 --> 06:27.382
It was just a huge thing.

06:27.603 --> 06:34.231
Well, mine was like an even more primitive version of that because those punches, at least you could order up these.

06:34.252 --> 06:37.356
I had to actually get the punch out and look like that.

06:37.676 --> 06:42.743
Was it an exercise for you or was it actually useful as a retrieval system for information?

06:43.183 --> 06:44.325
It would have been.

06:44.643 --> 07:14.025
very useful but for the fact that the punching took a lot longer than the note-taking and it led to ideas you'd be take a card that would have i don't know about hypertext let's say i had written some notes about it and i would see that there would be reason to punch it for reasons of uh of hypertext and for reasons of computers writing but also maybe because of its content for reasons of uh of um

07:15.035 --> 07:20.603
oh, I don't know, some social issue or some question about time and space or whatever.

07:21.184 --> 07:26.612
And the more I thought about the way to punch it, of course, I'd get more and more punches, I would think of new notes to take.

07:26.632 --> 07:31.039
So I'd be writing six or seven notes while I was working to punch the one card.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.823
So I ended up with lots of unpunched cards in a few of them.

07:34.003 --> 07:35.946
That was my problem.

07:35.966 --> 07:43.337
And I probably had, in the end, generated a few thousand cards and still exist like three-by-fives, really, because...

07:43.587 --> 08:06.979
I figured out the binary idea was a way to do something fast and so that if it was bibliography or if it was certain kinds of content or something like that it didn't say anything else at least yeah I could find it through that down the narrow edge I had about 12 or 16 punches here that I divided up into things that were quick

08:07.313 --> 08:08.795
access of a comic.

08:08.815 --> 08:15.785
I said, well, that was something about history or something about, you know, those kind of large topics.

08:15.805 --> 08:19.931
So I could needle those out in a hurry, and I did manage to punch those up pretty quickly.

08:19.971 --> 08:23.576
So most of the cards have one punch on the other side, but that's about it.

08:24.017 --> 08:34.531
Now, as a novelist, as a traditional linear print sense, do you have a sense of permanence?

08:34.551 --> 08:37.135
I mean, do you have a permanence of the text

08:37.334 --> 08:41.478
of what you created and having it be made of that?

08:43.700 --> 08:45.422
Well, yes and no.

08:46.063 --> 08:49.846
I mean, the permanence of the text will exist in the computer.

08:49.866 --> 08:52.349
It won't exist on paper.

08:52.369 --> 09:01.057
So already there's a kind of anomaly about it that what we think of as permanence has already moved to light anyhow.

09:01.117 --> 09:02.398
To light.

09:02.559 --> 09:04.000
To light.

09:04.435 --> 09:22.292
There will always be, as there are still monastery libraries with valuable manuscripts under glass, there will always be this kind of respect for the Gutenberg tradition as it moves into its museum status.

09:22.711 --> 09:30.348
It's a very cumbersome technology relative to the movement of light.

09:30.609 --> 09:36.923
Moving a book, moving the volume.

09:38.152 --> 09:51.389
around, hundreds of these things around, in trucks, using up petrol and shelf space and warehouse space and so on, is incredibly cumbersome compared to computer storage.

09:52.130 --> 10:03.265
So, I think publishing, for example, years ago I asked publishers, I mean, just before I even got into hypertext,

10:03.464 --> 10:07.690
in the late 80s, I was asking, why are they actually publishing their books?

10:07.750 --> 10:10.153
Why don't you get the bookstores to do the publishing?

10:10.173 --> 10:22.289
They provide, you provide your text by computer, in other days by disk, now by email, provide them the text and they can do the printing and binding and so on.

10:22.650 --> 10:31.041
There's no need to have this huge warehousing and pulping and having all these stocks, but of course,

10:31.527 --> 10:34.090
business is used to owning things that they sell.

10:34.130 --> 10:38.575
They're not, you know, toothpaste or toilet paper or books.

10:38.595 --> 10:48.506
And so they think of it as, you don't have product, it's not, you know, they're getting out of that finally, but they couldn't kind of perceive that.

10:48.566 --> 10:49.567
Now it's going to happen.

10:50.609 --> 10:57.957
And I think in the next decade, not even the same millennium,

10:58.240 --> 11:08.555
there will be increasing publishing by the bookstores, and the bookchains especially, they may actually start hiring their own little editorial staffs and just do it straight.

11:09.517 --> 11:24.479
And the idea will be that with a kind of inexpensive binding mechanism and cover design can also be done computerized and moved by light, they will produce all the books in their bookstores.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.442
You come in, you'll come in and say,

11:26.742 --> 11:28.264
I would like a copy of this.

11:28.284 --> 11:29.185
There'll be a sample copy.

11:29.265 --> 11:31.529
I'd like a copy of that and come back in the afternoon.

11:31.549 --> 11:32.169
It's there.

11:32.250 --> 11:36.515
I went to the MIT Media Lab for this book, this project I'm working with.

11:36.736 --> 11:42.964
There's a young man there, 29 years old, and he's hitting the project called the e-book, the electronic book.

11:43.004 --> 11:44.066
I've heard of this.

11:44.326 --> 11:46.089
And it will look like a regular codex.

11:46.389 --> 11:51.035
And they said they're two or three years away from it, and they're doing this with electronic ink.

11:51.116 --> 11:56.563
And you will load each one of these volumes that you'll buy with a little chip.

11:56.695 --> 11:58.378
It'll have 3,000 books in it.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.444
And you dial up the book that you want.

12:01.464 --> 12:06.534
And then each page, we have a paper or a text book.

12:06.554 --> 12:08.437
You'll read the book.

12:08.457 --> 12:10.080
And each page will be a screen.

12:10.481 --> 12:11.803
And we're working on this.

12:11.823 --> 12:14.248
My wife, in fact, found this item, and I went to...

12:15.089 --> 12:17.251
But we're still talking about... Soft screens.

12:17.311 --> 12:21.456
And we're still talking about discrete work that is not changing.

12:21.476 --> 12:27.302
I guess when I... I say between hypertextual... When I'm talking about permanence, I'm talking about artistic recreation and expression.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.445
There's no need for hypertextual change, either.

12:30.045 --> 12:37.914
I mean, the interactivity that's so much brooded about is not necessarily a standard feature of this stuff.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.518
The...

12:41.802 --> 12:43.485
There is.

12:43.505 --> 12:48.933
We're having, in fact, I'm getting a conference on these issues at Brown next spring.

12:49.253 --> 13:07.000
Inviting a lot of the techies in and mixing them up with writers so that we try to get the right... Right now, much of this is, especially as seen on the Internet, is...

13:07.385 --> 13:18.521
It's hostile to text, and the idea of text, yeah, and the idea of text of any kind is hostile to anything that isn't Victorian or oral.

13:18.541 --> 13:29.376
And to try to create a warmer atmosphere for this in the way they develop any technology.

13:30.436 --> 13:38.087
The issue arises about the future of fiction, and there is a strong feeling amongst a lot of people.

13:38.107 --> 13:47.159
The future of fiction looks a little like games play, and therefore it is instable, and it does have a lack of permanence in a sense.

13:47.179 --> 13:52.847
Each text continues to develop as the games players play with it.

13:52.867 --> 14:00.257
But there's another kind of narrative art which exists inside

14:01.216 --> 14:28.354
um the hypertextual medium that is itself a fixed entity is not it's not read twice the same as a 10 meters print book it's just uh it exists as a as a whole finished and enclosed thing one of the things we we do about

14:28.672 --> 14:46.618
doing my hyper-fictional effects, which are really focused on not the games-playing metaphor, but upon the traditional narrative metaphors, is to ask, how do you achieve organicity in such a fluid medium?

14:46.638 --> 14:57.193
I mean, when you have a reader entering into your narrative space with so many possibilities, the way they can approach the text,

14:58.135 --> 15:07.453
How do you not having the support of the page-turning mechanism create a feeling of an organic whole?

15:08.955 --> 15:10.618
And this is a terrible challenge.

15:10.638 --> 15:11.781
It's not easy.

15:11.821 --> 15:13.985
Do people experience this today?

15:14.546 --> 15:21.038
Is there a reader of the future that has to be required to come along with the fiction of the future?

15:21.220 --> 15:25.446
I mean, are there people that enjoy this kind of reading experience today?

15:25.946 --> 15:26.587
Oh, yeah.

15:26.607 --> 15:28.550
Is it an artistic sense?

15:28.610 --> 15:30.913
I don't know how, I don't know how.

15:31.274 --> 15:32.455
Or recreational sense?

15:32.475 --> 15:34.038
I'm wondering what it is.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.800
Well, most of it's recreational still.

15:37.983 --> 15:41.127
In terms of readers, I mean, not in terms of writers.

15:41.147 --> 15:41.908
Better writers.

15:41.928 --> 15:43.831
But then, it's true of books.

15:43.851 --> 15:46.114
I mean, it's true of books.

15:47.107 --> 15:53.983
All the great writers, few of the great writers I know have any audience.

15:54.004 --> 15:57.572
And that's even true of great writers in the past who've got to

15:57.957 --> 15:59.480
vertical audience through time.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.551
They've got tremendous respect amongst a few people in each generation, but are not widely read.

16:05.693 --> 16:07.857
Dampty's still not a bestseller.

16:08.218 --> 16:12.687
Shakespeare comes close in this country, but not most other places, but Cervantes.

16:12.707 --> 16:18.379
I mean, you can almost, there's almost no writer who at any given moment

16:18.528 --> 16:21.873
in time had sold widely.

16:21.893 --> 16:25.279
A letter we would describe as a great letter.

16:25.359 --> 16:29.465
Well, one that the permanence of his text means something.

16:29.505 --> 16:35.575
A lot of permanent texts could just as well be done, because, you know, there's a lot of crap that's kept as permanent texts.

16:36.398 --> 16:53.138
And it's kind of this awesome respect for the book that emerged out of the way the book evolved out of the Middle Ages, out of the panastic libraries, the secrets hidden away that one would anticipate existed in the book once everybody could get their hands on it.

16:53.158 --> 17:00.107
You know, how the book of Revelations might be really understood as a now contemporary language.

17:00.127 --> 17:03.471
And the Kabbalah idea.

17:04.372 --> 17:06.034
And...

17:06.875 --> 17:19.767
That awe for books, with terrible crimes and burning books and so on, that we feel is misplaced in a large sense.

17:19.787 --> 17:26.252
There's a lot of rubbish that really should be put back in the toilet paper.

17:26.953 --> 17:30.316
But we don't do it because we know nobody can make the judgment.

17:32.198 --> 17:34.620
What gets booked is apt to be the best stuff.

17:35.073 --> 17:36.755
kind of rat, not the worst.

17:41.319 --> 17:51.849
The computer, of course, voids all of that, because nothing needs—now we really have permanents, right before, books decay in libraries, you get burnt out for single copies banished, and so on.

17:51.869 --> 17:54.852
That needs never happening, but now we do have a true program.

17:55.913 --> 17:58.476
Well, except that there is a question that we don't.

17:58.696 --> 18:02.700
I mean, a lot of the stories we see

18:03.288 --> 18:05.853
We see data taken from some of these space probes.

18:05.873 --> 18:09.079
It's not even 15 years old, and they can't even access it.

18:09.179 --> 18:12.365
It's deteriorating.

18:12.786 --> 18:15.391
There is no guarantee that... No, there never is.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.172
There never is.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.835
I agree.

18:17.856 --> 18:25.009
All I meant was that the technology itself works

18:25.377 --> 18:28.700
as a more efficient library than the libraries do.

18:28.720 --> 18:34.987
That's what I mean, in your doing of libraries.

18:35.928 --> 18:52.465
And that although, of course, they fail to everything, to everything human fails, they have more of a chance of achieving those goals that those are desirable goals.

18:52.867 --> 19:17.119
than our traditional methods i know there's a lot of problems first one of the things the main issue that we're bringing up in our brown conference is standards because one of the huge problems is changing standards um that all the stuff i did after i've got to move now to windows and uh

19:18.061 --> 19:23.208
it'll eventually become more or less unreadable, even though it exists on disks, backup disks, and so on.

19:23.388 --> 19:31.099
People will have to find old programs to read, which, you know, may not be easily accessible.

19:31.179 --> 19:35.866
It's like lost languages or stuff like any new kinds of translators.

19:38.309 --> 19:44.878
But one of the standards that was a kind of amazing standard, I remember

19:46.006 --> 20:03.950
I remember it was fairly recently, it must have been, well, within the last five years or so, someone pointed out to me that asking ASCII is only like 20 years old or something like that.

20:04.050 --> 20:05.352
It's very recent.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.857
I mean, it's a really, really recent idea.

20:09.317 --> 20:09.938
And yet it's old.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.970
Yeah, it's the oldest thing we've got, really, in a way.

20:13.771 --> 20:18.617
And you worry that, what if suddenly that were changed?

20:18.737 --> 20:25.286
If you moved from that to something else, because something would be more efficient, what would be the consequences of that?

20:25.306 --> 20:31.053
And, of course, it would immediately make inaccessible just vast areas.

20:32.014 --> 20:37.421
It doesn't mean that you couldn't quite quickly translate everything into the new and discard the old.

20:37.981 --> 20:40.144
That's one of the great advantages, if you don't have to

20:40.630 --> 20:47.459
It doesn't have irreplaceable physical content.

20:47.479 --> 20:55.790
Its physical content is, as with all digitized information, is in its reproduction.

20:55.810 --> 21:00.316
We will eventually digitize everything, smells and technical stuff.

21:00.376 --> 21:10.570
So all of our central experiences can be in some manner digitized, but it only means that you put a code in that can somehow, something at the other end can actually translate that code back into the real things.

21:11.022 --> 21:20.991
So that if you put in the note C, you know, in digitized form, it comes out C on some loudspeak, some system that reads it and reproduces that sound.

21:21.652 --> 21:35.345
So anything like tactile experiences or anything that has to do with our information exchange can be digitized and reproduced, provided at the other end there is something that can reproduce it.

21:35.365 --> 21:39.409
And that's always the difficult thing, why we do these complicated suits and

21:39.710 --> 21:47.959
you know, glasses and so on for virtual reality, is because the hard part is not digitizing, but undigitizing.

21:47.979 --> 21:50.922
You might get back into something.

21:51.663 --> 22:09.261
So, the problem of standard shifts and tape deterioration and so on really is not an impossible one to answer, because we're not dealing with

22:09.342 --> 22:11.745
with objects that have to be in some way preserved.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.668
We're dealing with the spec-wise tape that that stuff is stored on.

22:14.708 --> 22:19.654
But basically, we're dealing with something that can be translated quickly into any other kind of form.

22:19.694 --> 22:21.355
The term they use now is migration.

22:22.116 --> 22:27.943
Someone has to be assured of the migration tape.

22:27.963 --> 22:31.066
They say it's always zeros and ones in the China system.

22:31.086 --> 22:34.871
I went through this at Cornell, and they were all headshots up there.

22:35.391 --> 22:37.153
This whole thing was going on.

22:37.173 --> 22:38.775
Well, in fact, Piper took it again.

22:39.380 --> 22:40.922
Well, not hypertext.

22:40.942 --> 22:51.356
The real use of it became up there, because hypertext began with Ted Nelson, who came to Brown, actually, at a very critical moment, his career in Brown's development.

22:52.237 --> 22:57.624
He was brought there by a graphics man called Andrews Van Damme, Andy Van Damme.

22:59.226 --> 23:03.211
Andy was one of the early pioneers in computer graphics.

23:04.533 --> 23:07.176
And Nelson came and did a...

23:08.337 --> 23:13.004
a lot of research in hypertextual form.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.287
Have you read his work at all?

23:15.307 --> 23:15.447
No.

23:15.467 --> 23:23.498
Computer Lib, and, um... I didn't bring along it.

23:23.719 --> 23:25.341
By email, I'll send you.

23:25.501 --> 23:25.962
Okay.

23:25.982 --> 23:29.967
Well, there's a conversation out on the web right now.

23:30.047 --> 23:34.153
I participated in it.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.475
It was called, um...

23:37.042 --> 24:06.745
rethinking ted nelson or something like that so i'll send you the uh i'll send you the url for that it's it's speed magazine speed feed f-e-e-d and uh they deal with four of his different four concepts thinker toys idea and his links and he was the guy that developed the whole idea of hypertext his invention the word this is

24:06.978 --> 24:28.834
was a kind of 60s guru for all this stuff and but at cornell uh is where they formed up this little group with extra stewart and most of i think i don't know story the nancy kaplan in her kitchen she now lives with the first gatherings of these people began and this is so important

24:29.168 --> 24:36.679
Well, I'm writing about Cornell, and they just seem to come up in this context every place I've seen.

24:36.839 --> 24:40.564
My son was a Cornell grad, so I got to know Cornell well.

24:41.406 --> 24:45.932
But Nancy's now in Baltimore.

24:46.473 --> 24:51.480
She lives with Stuart Miltrup, who's the Cypotex guy.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.091
She's a very bright woman.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.094
If you're doing all this stuff, she'd be a good person to talk to.

24:57.234 --> 24:57.655
Kaplan?

24:57.735 --> 24:58.155
Kaplan, yeah.

24:58.175 --> 24:58.636
K-A-P-L-A-N?

24:58.876 --> 24:59.056
Yeah.

24:59.136 --> 25:00.657
At Hopkins, you said?

25:00.678 --> 25:05.122
No, at the University of Baltimore.

25:05.142 --> 25:05.622
University of Baltimore.

25:05.642 --> 25:06.102
Yeah.

25:06.122 --> 25:09.365
Well, Stuart's there, too, and Stuart's very good to talk to.

25:10.206 --> 25:15.311
I think Stuart's the wisest and most innovative of all the hypertext writers right now.

25:15.331 --> 25:16.812
Stuart Malthrop.

25:16.972 --> 25:19.735
M-O-U-L-T-H-R-O-P.

25:20.055 --> 25:21.957
This is his novel I talk about here.

25:22.190 --> 25:24.573
which I found much too academic, Victory Garden.

25:25.013 --> 25:26.976
But he's moved away from that immensely.

25:27.056 --> 25:32.182
He's working very vigorously out on the net, which is a hard thing to do.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.685
It's a very hard environment to work in.

25:34.705 --> 25:40.772
And he's really trying to subvert and convert it.

25:40.792 --> 25:42.575
And he's a very valuable person.

25:42.595 --> 25:44.497
You've got how many novels here?

25:44.597 --> 25:48.822
I don't know if it's heavy.

25:48.842 --> 25:49.663
A dozen, perhaps?

25:50.404 --> 25:51.285
More than that.

25:53.138 --> 25:57.845
What's the more exciting medium for you to write in now?

25:57.885 --> 25:59.247
Well, it's not so much exciting.

26:00.249 --> 26:08.501
I tend to work on several things at once and have done since I began writing them.

26:08.922 --> 26:14.951
And it means that there are like 50 to 100 projects unfinished always.

26:14.971 --> 26:21.441
They're all sitting there like ideas or paragraphs or chapters or something that should be done.

26:21.826 --> 26:34.799
What I was looking at now, I'm trying to work on a piece that I began in 1969 when I moved here.

26:35.480 --> 26:42.387
I just made a movie, a documentary film at Iowa, called On a Confrontation in Iowa City.

26:42.407 --> 26:44.629
It had to do with the Vietnam War protests.

26:45.390 --> 26:47.813
And this was in the 60s?

26:48.553 --> 26:50.095
Yeah.

26:50.345 --> 26:57.117
I shot it all, and I had helped develop the film, and I had A and B wrote it, and I'd done it all.

26:57.177 --> 27:01.024
I just wanted to learn everything I could learn about filmmaking at that time.

27:01.565 --> 27:15.289
So I came away with a story idea, which I began then when I moved here, and interrupted it to work on a public burning, I thought, for six months, and five, six years went by.

27:16.130 --> 27:22.339
And then I would keep taking it with me every while I went and working on it, but then something else would take over it.

27:22.359 --> 27:25.123
I went to Venice with it, and Penopio to Fulbright, etc.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.287
And so I brought it here again.

27:28.307 --> 27:32.934
Now that's, you know, we're 30 years later, and I'm still working on this text.

27:34.096 --> 27:37.601
It's in the form of nine novellas, really, long novellas.

27:37.741 --> 27:39.383
It's about a pornographic film we wrote.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.827
Link to use the current text?

27:42.247 --> 27:42.928
No, no, not really.

27:42.968 --> 27:45.512
It's very narrative, very much a book narrative.

27:46.505 --> 27:57.436
in which this pornographic film hero, his whole life has lived in film, and the films, each of the time, are made by a different woman filmmaker.

27:57.456 --> 27:59.638
So there's nine women making these films.

27:59.738 --> 28:02.440
And it's very hard work.

28:02.460 --> 28:03.762
It's very, very hard work.

28:03.822 --> 28:07.625
So it's one reason I resist it all the time and do something else instead.

28:08.486 --> 28:15.533
But because I have so many of these sorts of things, it's never been a huge temptation to really get into writing about things.

28:16.407 --> 28:17.529
I like teaching it.

28:17.549 --> 28:20.573
I like to see what happens to students' heads when they get into it.

28:20.593 --> 28:22.797
They become much better readers, much better writers.

28:22.837 --> 28:23.097
Do they?

28:23.518 --> 28:38.140
Oh, it transforms that perception of what... I used to, back in the 60s, I used to teach a course, I still taught it right up into the late 80s, called Exemplary Ancient Fictions.

28:38.160 --> 28:43.528
And we read creation myths and...

28:43.778 --> 29:02.399
The Gilgamesh Epic, and Enuma Elish, and Book of Genesis, and Greek stories, and myths, and Romans, and all the metamorphoses, and folktales, and various things on up to medieval romance.

29:02.419 --> 29:06.384
And the whole idea of this thing was it was a writing course.

29:06.404 --> 29:09.347
They had to do a certain amount of academic work, but they also had to do some creative work.

29:09.918 --> 29:25.328
The whole idea was to work with writers to help them understand narrative strategies that were pre-Servantes was my cutting off point, and to perceive the possibility of narrative beyond what was, in those days,

29:25.493 --> 29:26.815
the standard form.

29:26.835 --> 29:39.653
As of before, Star Trek movies and, you know, a lot of things that might have inspired the imagination just weren't there, and that we had these kind of dull, insistent repetitions of the past in terms of form.

29:40.914 --> 29:48.064
And the inability to see, until we worked at it, how conventional the so-called well-made story or the novel was.

29:48.144 --> 29:52.851
I mean, it was not something that was natural, as often felt to be, but depended

29:53.135 --> 30:01.470
I didn't use the words in those days, but the Pentagon booked technology for the feeling of being in the right place, you know, being the right thing for that medium.

30:01.490 --> 30:07.541
But we were working on forms that escaped this limitation.

30:07.561 --> 30:16.678
And those ancient sections we'd work all semester long, and only sort of in closing moments of weeks.

30:16.912 --> 30:23.941
the light would begin to dawn, and something would begin to happen with the writing that would escape this limitation.

30:23.982 --> 30:27.406
Undergraduates were more quick to catch on, but the grad students were dreadful.

30:27.426 --> 30:35.477
They were so ironclad already in their notion of what writing ought to be.

30:36.352 --> 30:39.558
I taught my first hyperfiction workshop, and the first week it was over.

30:39.598 --> 30:41.220
I mean, that part was done.

30:41.701 --> 30:43.805
You just sat down and you started, and what happened?

30:43.825 --> 30:46.990
I mean, there was a sudden awareness about form.

30:47.151 --> 30:49.354
You start with nothing, and so you have to build everything.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.959
If you want line, you've got to put it there.

30:51.979 --> 31:01.836
And the discovery of that, and the discovery, therefore, of how reading was done, and how writing fed the reading, and how the form dictated both,

31:02.086 --> 31:12.158
was suddenly, or the technology dictated the form of the table, was suddenly transparent.

31:12.258 --> 31:18.285
And so the leap is sort of instantaneous and simply non-problematic.

31:19.206 --> 31:23.011
Then, of course, it becomes interesting, well, you know, what's the wonderful things about it?

31:23.051 --> 31:26.294
What are the great moments of your book-reading life?

31:26.735 --> 31:31.941
And are these gone if we're in this space, or can we somehow find a way to...

31:32.258 --> 31:34.922
to do the same thing here, is it possible?

31:35.022 --> 31:37.325
And that's kind of the challenge.

31:37.625 --> 31:52.265
Of course, I'm dealing with very modest writers, students for the most part, and there have been no great writers yet working in hypotech, so dealing with people whose books I read them, I'd have mixed feelings about.

31:52.285 --> 31:56.271
Well, I'm not just talking about students, you know, there have been no great writers yet in hypotech.

31:56.291 --> 31:56.411
No.

31:56.471 --> 31:58.654
That's an important statement, right?

31:59.056 --> 32:04.683
In my second review, which you've read, I review, at that time, all the extensions.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.807
Nobody gets a big plus.

32:09.309 --> 32:13.875
There's always a little twist at the end, even the positive reviews.

32:14.035 --> 32:20.844
But there's good stuff, there's good writing, as good as most stuff you'll find in books.

32:20.924 --> 32:22.326
We don't have a Joyce or Cervantes.

32:22.346 --> 32:25.890
Of course, Cervantes was 150 years after Gutenberg.

32:26.258 --> 32:51.321
know it may take a while before we find the committed writer who's so engaged and so understands the medium and so loves it that writes the thing that you know overwhelms us what would be the mark of genius in your view i'm not so sure i can especially when you're engaging the participation of the reader i can't i can't say for sure i know the things that have worked so far that suggest

32:51.824 --> 32:55.570
I have no idea what, in the end, it will be.

32:56.692 --> 33:10.454
One reason for that is that one of my frettings is the demotion of text itself, the diminution of its importance and power.

33:11.636 --> 33:19.148
I'm struggling against that, but this may, in the future, look like a

33:19.533 --> 33:39.195
Dinah Saurik struggled, and it may be that all narrative in the future will be multimedia, and that this idea of text alone will be an old-fashioned idea that will be revisited like a kind of scholarly or playful exercise.

33:39.215 --> 33:45.102
I hope not, because what I feel to be the most interactive thing we do is

33:45.925 --> 34:04.727
look at those little squiggles on a page or screen and convert them in our heads into vast landscapes and complex characters and all sorts of things that happen inside our heads just by

34:04.910 --> 34:09.316
reading these little coded things here.

34:09.436 --> 34:20.911
Just putting a few of your words out in these articles, you say, fluidity, contingency, indeterminism, plurality, discontinuity, every kind of principles of paper text.

34:20.931 --> 34:23.334
We have absolute, absolute.

34:23.815 --> 34:27.360
Yeah, I'm not saying necessarily those are all positives.

34:27.460 --> 34:30.043
I'm saying that they're reality.

34:30.063 --> 34:34.309
And that, therefore, it's a little hard for me working pretty much

34:34.778 --> 34:45.636
in the old print medium to foresee in 1990s exactly what great narrative art's going to look like in this medium fifty years from now.

34:45.656 --> 34:47.338
Do you think this is inevitable in your view?

34:47.419 --> 34:49.001
Oh, yeah.

34:49.322 --> 34:50.584
Digitization is inevitable.

34:50.604 --> 34:59.238
I mean, the minute I understood digitizing, the minute I got the little glimmer out of it, oh, yeah, I got this, it's going to be a total revolution.

34:59.258 --> 35:00.600
It's just so obvious.

35:01.576 --> 35:10.186
And, I mean, it may not be a revolution that lasts a million years, but it's certainly going to last for the next few hundred years, I'm sure.

35:10.387 --> 35:26.266
And this characteristic, the characteristics of digital information, you have to be alert to and aware of to understand what's going to happen.

35:26.386 --> 35:30.351
And that's all I've been trying to do, and what most people have been trying to do,

35:30.820 --> 35:58.752
and there are a lot of prophets and a lot of people who are have kind of convictions about what's going to happen but so far i've not been convinced by anything yet i don't see it so what i work with my students are traditional concepts they're not they're not they are they emerge from print so we talk about voice for example because voice seems to hold our hypertext together when nothing else does if the thing is all fragmentary things at least

35:59.069 --> 36:03.896
convincing and compelling voice.

36:04.237 --> 36:09.725
Let's say a writer like Joyce who was working in this space or Samuel Beckett.

36:11.047 --> 36:24.368
Just the texture of the voice itself would be compelling enough to convince the reader that it's worth carrying on through a space that is a little bit hard to map in the sense of

36:24.854 --> 36:25.775
I don't know exactly where.

36:25.815 --> 36:27.117
I don't know what page I'm on.

36:27.197 --> 36:28.799
I don't know how much earlier I got to go.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.424
These are questions that you run into or something.

36:32.444 --> 36:47.866
And voice is a counterbalance against the feeling of dispersion and non-discontinence.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.190
But that's one.

36:51.350 --> 36:54.034
As I already mentioned, I'm already looking for

36:54.942 --> 37:24.004
what creates organic unity in a work that is not a linear text, one of the answers to that tends to be that the narrative tends to be looked at like a physical space, not something that is strung on a line, but something that exists

37:24.490 --> 37:42.988
here is the same kind that exists here and it's like books do if you reread a book you know books you go back i've gone back to the ulysses on donkey only many times i no longer go back to the from page one to the end i go back to the

37:43.441 --> 37:44.743
where I want to go.

37:44.883 --> 37:53.318
I know them well, and I can go at any point in them, and I can search out things and just think about those aspects of that narrative.

37:53.338 --> 37:56.684
So this requires a fresh reading, a prior reading.

37:56.704 --> 37:57.926
Yes, yes, it does.

37:57.946 --> 38:04.357
But the fact is that it exists then in my mind as a landscape and not as a linear narrative as such.

38:04.437 --> 38:06.360
I mean, I understand the linear nature of it,

38:06.593 --> 38:12.139
And that can be true, although I also can understand its spatial aspect.

38:12.859 --> 38:32.899
So if I'm inventing a narrative in hypertext, I will tend to think of it in some ways, perhaps, or I might possibly think of it, as a narrative that exists whole and instantaneously in space.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.622
Now there are ways in which you can

38:36.344 --> 38:40.349
important off-spaces that cannot be reached into certain spaces to the distance.

38:40.389 --> 38:47.558
So you can create a kind of limited sort of linear direction to something, if you want it, if you need it.

38:48.379 --> 38:48.980
Maybe you don't.

38:49.060 --> 38:49.921
Your memory doesn't.

38:51.463 --> 38:58.692
And the only way that the memory requires linearity is that it's a big geographical space, which you think is back on those years.

38:58.712 --> 39:03.178
If I ask you to tell me, you know, well, how did you get into

39:04.863 --> 39:07.727
how did you get into this work of writing, these sorts of books?

39:08.188 --> 39:13.315
You wouldn't say, well, I was born on such and such a day, and I was born in a hospital, in a hospital at some point at a time.

39:13.335 --> 39:14.898
You don't start that way.

39:14.918 --> 39:18.683
You start, well, and you tell me an experience you had, and that experience leads to another.

39:19.344 --> 39:24.572
And even if you're telling me, you're probably thinking of other things you're not going to tell me, but a flash to mind is what is all.

39:24.592 --> 39:28.918
And this is all hypothetical experience.

39:28.938 --> 39:33.925
And so if students work in a space that has a kind of

39:34.968 --> 40:04.182
spatial concept already then it sometimes makes it easier to create a structure that has walls that has limits has a wholeness and it doesn't matter if the reader explores it all i don't need to explore the entirety of your memory nor do you for that matter to arrive at a rather full understanding of you or of whatever the issue is or whatever the stories we're talking about and um

40:05.545 --> 40:14.857
All reading experiences are, by their nature, linear.

40:14.877 --> 40:20.003
And so the linear experience is imposed upon this space willy-nilly.

40:20.023 --> 40:23.968
You can't escape the way we live in time.

40:25.270 --> 40:30.977
The way we approach a narrative is to step into it at a certain moment and leave it at a certain moment.

40:30.997 --> 40:34.101
And as this process unfolds, it's a linear experience.

40:35.195 --> 40:47.378
even though what we're doing is rifting perhaps a geographical landscape in which the choices we make are all right about how we're going to face here.

40:47.398 --> 40:55.093
That aspect of it, that paradox, as it were, can be part of the narrative itself and become

40:55.816 --> 40:59.621
as it was in Don Quixote, become an element in it.

40:59.881 --> 41:08.153
But Don Quixote exists and does a discrete, complete, unchanged work.

41:08.193 --> 41:09.494
Well, it's a kind of hypertext.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.978
It can also just complete and unchanged.

41:12.699 --> 41:17.665
I mean, in fact, if you buy any of these discs by Michael Joyce, they are what they are.

41:17.685 --> 41:20.028
You put the disc in, you read it, and you take the disc out.

41:20.048 --> 41:21.250
It's like having a book.

41:21.382 --> 41:24.285
It's just that the book doesn't have page-turning mechanisms.

41:24.305 --> 41:25.787
It has a different kind of mechanism.

41:25.807 --> 41:32.195
But when we talk about the hypertext, we also talk about the experience of engaging the reader to develop their own scenarios.

41:32.716 --> 41:34.277
That's a different kind of writing.

41:34.398 --> 41:35.979
That's why I was saying it.

41:35.999 --> 41:42.828
There are those who see it as a kind of games playing and believe that all the great fiction of the future will have this characteristic.

41:42.848 --> 41:48.975
There will be a huge mass of databases in which the writer enters into the database

41:49.225 --> 41:56.295
and creates their own narrative that were out of the potential there and structures those elements and adds elements as they want to.

41:56.335 --> 42:00.501
That's the kind of Dungeons and Dragons way of going at fiction.

42:00.521 --> 42:04.586
But that's not the only way that it's being done, at least at this time.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.589
What happens in the future, I can't say.

42:06.609 --> 42:12.798
At this time, I see the likelihood that the author, far from being dead, is very much alive.

42:13.499 --> 42:17.224
The author is going to become, in some respects, like a film director.

42:17.913 --> 42:23.240
in that he will require additional talents to fulfill everything he wants to do in the narrative.

42:23.901 --> 42:37.057
So that if you want graphic material, you want sound, you want some other things, voiceover, whatever, you're going to have to get some other talent to help you out.

42:37.077 --> 42:41.423
But it's still going to be your work, and it probably, probably,

42:41.639 --> 42:43.061
you're not going to allow tampering.

42:43.602 --> 42:44.343
I mean, probably.

42:44.363 --> 42:47.006
You're not going to allow it, but it's essentially tampering.

42:47.367 --> 42:48.348
It may or may not be.

42:48.428 --> 42:54.416
I mean, some people think it's kind of fun, the idea of opening up, and they may write something that's very exciting.

42:54.436 --> 42:59.363
Some people being the reader, but how about the creator who wants to have it?

42:59.383 --> 43:03.468
There are creators who like the idea that, please, get in here and change all this and rewrite it.

43:04.209 --> 43:06.853
And they provide what you might call a

43:07.492 --> 43:15.142
a playground or a jungle gym, you know, something that kind of framework that you can play around on.

43:15.162 --> 43:18.926
You can do your own kind of thermostat, you can invent stuff and put anything around this one.

43:19.026 --> 43:20.088
But what indoors?

43:20.108 --> 43:20.889
What indoors?

43:20.909 --> 43:27.097
I mean, if we define an age by its cultural... No, yeah, but that's one of them.

43:27.117 --> 43:35.507
Then we can see, yeah, but how do you know if one of these interactions is magnificent and it only exists at one time, but it's, I mean...

43:36.095 --> 43:37.478
Maybe you're missing something here.

43:37.738 --> 43:42.948
Well, that may be the nature of the age and what makes it great, if viewed from a certain angle.

43:43.549 --> 43:51.083
It may be seen that this appetite for permanence and so on is a perverse appetite.

43:51.604 --> 43:52.846
It's been religious with us.

43:53.106 --> 43:56.753
Yeah, and then finally we're shedding it, you know, finally getting rid of this thing.

43:57.053 --> 43:59.716
and understand life as it really is lived.

43:59.856 --> 44:05.302
I'm just giving it art, being the devil's advocate.

44:05.362 --> 44:09.067
I'm still basically a book writer and reader.

44:09.087 --> 44:10.448
That's very important.

44:10.468 --> 44:11.770
No, I still basically am.

44:12.070 --> 44:15.114
It's just that I don't have any hostility to all of this.

44:16.936 --> 44:18.357
So I feel comfortable.

44:18.377 --> 44:19.078
I don't feel...

44:19.632 --> 44:21.054
I don't feel uncomfortable.

44:21.114 --> 44:22.055
I don't work in it.

44:22.135 --> 44:26.461
I actually am sort of playing around with the hypertext right here now.

44:26.501 --> 44:34.851
But even as I'm doing it, I'm simultaneously doing it in a linear form.

44:34.891 --> 44:36.834
Did you bring some examples of hypertext?

44:36.874 --> 44:42.961
Did you mention that you might... Well, I have disks, but I have only my copies.

44:43.021 --> 44:44.563
I should have copied.

44:44.664 --> 44:45.825
It's all on Macs.

44:46.447 --> 44:47.909
I'm working on PCs.

44:47.969 --> 44:49.231
I've always worked on them.

44:49.271 --> 44:53.556
There's stuff on Macs I've got at home, but I could have sent to you anything you wanted, really.

44:54.057 --> 44:59.424
By the way, I would be happy to show you the quotes.

44:59.504 --> 45:10.378
I've got problems showing subjects what I've written before I use it to make sure we get it right.

45:10.662 --> 45:14.466
You've not looked at any of these guys?

45:14.546 --> 45:17.068
I've had people like Joyce and most of them.

45:17.088 --> 45:18.349
Joyce, I haven't.

45:18.429 --> 45:22.213
I've got the hypertext book for questions, Landau's book.

45:22.233 --> 45:23.995
All right.

45:24.015 --> 45:29.480
Well, George Landau is a great enthusiast.

45:29.500 --> 45:34.865
He's one of these guys who just has this kind of wonderful optimism about the form.

45:34.985 --> 45:37.868
It's fun to quote him because it's full of

45:38.185 --> 46:03.045
sort of hyperbolic anticipation but um but he's not a writer i mean he's not a creative writer so you really ought to look at what uh there's an interesting essay i only have a single copy of it by jack barrett did you ever see that

46:03.346 --> 46:05.709
I can access it.

46:05.869 --> 46:08.353
Yeah, I was going to be reading it.

46:08.373 --> 46:11.497
Wilson Portals, Spring 96.

46:11.738 --> 46:19.368
It's opposed to it all, of course.

46:19.628 --> 46:22.532
It's a little bit ignorant, but it's not that.

46:22.552 --> 46:33.167
One of my students went down there as a grad student, one of my undergrad students went down there as a grad student, and got Jack excited at Hopkins, got him excited about the whole thing.

46:34.278 --> 47:03.036
And so he quotes him a lot, and the kid did a demo, and he was kind of the worst person to show a skeptic what could be done in his form, because he was one of these, he's a really nice guy, but he's one of these, you know, I think I'm sort of Joyce Carol Oates-type writers, it just spills out, you know, never stops, it's never rewritten, I mean, there's tons of it, it's quite dull.

47:03.218 --> 47:07.284
And so it kind of convinced Barthes.

47:07.644 --> 47:13.212
First, it looked very much like print fiction, and second, it was much more boring than print fiction.

47:13.232 --> 47:16.777
And so he got kind of the wrong message.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.863
Are you here in that sabbatical?

47:20.963 --> 47:22.124
Yeah.

47:22.285 --> 47:24.828
And what, are you going back to Brown?

47:24.908 --> 47:28.273
Well, I'm going back in August, but not to Brown.

47:28.353 --> 47:32.719
I'm going back to South Carolina first.

47:33.121 --> 47:49.523
Well, I'll be back there in January, and I'll be back to Oklahoma for that.

47:49.583 --> 47:53.728
There's a film that C-Squad did, I think,

47:54.113 --> 47:56.496
The Symposium of Brown?

47:56.556 --> 47:57.117
No, yeah.

47:57.378 --> 47:57.618
Yeah.

47:57.738 --> 47:58.579
It was okay.

47:58.659 --> 48:01.443
I haven't seen it very soon.

48:01.523 --> 48:06.771
No, you didn't do our best sessions.

48:06.791 --> 48:09.254
Our best sessions were architectural.

48:09.415 --> 48:13.180
The ones I did are not.

48:13.480 --> 48:23.935
We've been sort of leading players in that chug group, starting as not with the development of the technology, but with how humanists can make use of it.

48:24.809 --> 48:38.545
and how technology can be bent to suit the needs of students in both ways, which is kind of what conference I'm organizing, which is going to be aimed solely at fiction writing.

48:39.166 --> 48:48.978
It's not going to be typical of all the other stuff about, say, libraries or teaching history courses or something like that.

48:48.998 --> 48:53.483
It's just about what fiction writers want and need in the technology

48:54.290 --> 49:03.382
what the tech people have as ideas that might excite the practice.

49:03.462 --> 49:06.786
Is this a separate department at Brown, or is it a Lewis department?

49:06.806 --> 49:08.008
No, it's a mixed-up thing.

49:08.048 --> 49:10.310
In fact, it staggers along.

49:10.330 --> 49:13.855
It doesn't—Chug is voluntary.

49:14.536 --> 49:17.800
Grad students organized it, and then faculty started to attend it.

49:18.995 --> 49:25.754
And the Chuck Group leaders, the group of them that were kind of interesting, I got to know well.

49:26.597 --> 49:29.545
And after my first hypertext course, I took

49:29.727 --> 49:31.109
I learned about a lot of things.

49:31.169 --> 49:33.492
I learned about very interesting things going on at Brown.

49:33.512 --> 49:34.874
I learned about the graphics.

49:34.894 --> 49:35.915
I'd never been up there.

49:35.935 --> 49:37.397
We had a virtual reality machine.

49:37.417 --> 49:37.877
I didn't know that.

49:37.897 --> 49:39.600
I took all my students to do it.

49:39.700 --> 49:50.333
And then I learned about, of course, MCM had its, uh, it just got into digitizing film equipment and audio equipment.

49:50.353 --> 49:55.140
And there was a mathematician, Tom Banchoff, working in a hypertextual format.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.102
There were students working on

49:57.520 --> 50:24.388
on screen, in a text that they called up, and there were models, and there were formulae, and the models could be looked at solid or just in lines, and they could be rotated, they would move if you set them moving, and then you could change the formula a little bit, and you would see the distortion switch in the way the mathematical models altered.

50:24.706 --> 50:34.140
All along the way, there would be language that sometimes needed a definition, so you'd have a hypertextual link to understand the meaning of that word, or to look up a formula, etc.

50:34.160 --> 50:40.790
And every so often a student would come across a question, asking now, then, what, and ask a question.

50:40.810 --> 50:43.834
And they'd have to answer, and the answer would be automatically emailed to a TA.

50:44.996 --> 50:48.661
And the TA, if online, while a student would be able to get an answer back.

50:48.701 --> 50:51.365
No, this was almost ten years ago.

50:52.627 --> 50:53.228
Banshoff wrote,

50:53.647 --> 50:59.575
The book on the fourth dimension and then, or the fifth dimension, and then succeeding dimensions thereafter.

50:59.595 --> 51:13.152
And so I learned about, and there was an electronic music studio located in a very, just one little tiny room, about a third of the size of this room that just piled up with equipment.

51:13.172 --> 51:23.586
And so I decided that all of this stuff should somehow interlink, it's all digital stuff, and it should all find a kind of common base.

51:23.954 --> 51:36.094
There was an archeological dig going on in Tetra, organized by a computer genius there as a totally hyper, a total computer-driven event.

51:37.256 --> 51:41.102
And everything was

51:41.470 --> 51:49.444
was recorded in computerized formats, and they've got new equipment that actually triangulates the space.

51:49.464 --> 51:50.406
We've all done something.

51:50.787 --> 51:54.834
Information went immediately to the computer database.

51:54.854 --> 52:00.103
Every little fragment or anything that came up would be photographed in each dimension, so you could spin it around afterwards.

52:00.455 --> 52:02.538
All that stuff was done just doing the dig.

52:02.558 --> 52:04.880
The dig is still going on, by the way.

52:04.900 --> 52:08.385
Well, I saw all this stuff happening, so I thought it was time to organize them.

52:08.405 --> 52:16.174
The Chug group, the leaders, were trying to organize something called the scholarly—it ended up being called the scholarly technology group.

52:16.194 --> 52:19.218
They had other names for it, fancy ones at first.

52:19.238 --> 52:25.045
And so, they were ex-grad students who were lingering, but were the young geniuses on that ground.

52:26.138 --> 52:27.660
We said, well, let's find a space.

52:27.680 --> 52:32.845
We found a basement of Bradson that wasn't being used for much of anything.

52:32.865 --> 52:36.549
So I took the Provost on what was called a Hyperland Tour.

52:36.569 --> 52:41.094
And we organized and ended up a lot of developing people coming along, presidential staff and so on.

52:42.115 --> 52:47.581
And we took them on literally a walking tour all over campus to all of these sites.

52:47.962 --> 52:51.946
The Provost was suffering from the residuals of a flu.

52:52.046 --> 52:55.470
And by the time I got to the end of it, he was just absolutely pooped.

52:55.619 --> 53:00.203
took them through all these things, walked them into Banchoff's mathematics office.

53:00.223 --> 53:06.349
They were convinced this had no place in terms of support, because it had nothing to do with the students.

53:06.369 --> 53:07.551
It was just faculty special.

53:07.571 --> 53:07.751
No.

53:08.071 --> 53:11.595
And we were showing them how much it was, mostly undergrad, not even grad students.

53:11.615 --> 53:14.097
They arrived in Banchoff's office, and Banchoff had a meeting.

53:14.177 --> 53:14.938
He had to go through.

53:14.978 --> 53:19.222
Sorry, he could only be able to introduce what was going on, and then he had to leave.

53:19.282 --> 53:20.683
But meanwhile, he'd leave this kid.

53:20.723 --> 53:23.466
This kid looked like about 12 years old, a little girl.

53:24.239 --> 53:27.625
She turned out to be a little older, but not much.

53:27.645 --> 53:34.336
She was kind of young to miss the mathematics genius, undergrad, sophomore, and she was amazing.

53:34.356 --> 53:42.049
She just left these old guys standing there agape as she showed them through this math book, online math book.

53:42.429 --> 53:48.880
So we ended up at the ascent bottom, the basement of the grad center, very tired, sat on packing crates.

53:49.147 --> 54:03.441
and said, all right, what we'd like to do is make this space a multimedia lab, a classroom, and a space for academic research in computer work, especially for humanistic research.

54:04.022 --> 54:06.765
And we got it within 18 months.

54:07.205 --> 54:07.906
It was hard work.

54:07.986 --> 54:10.709
The provost actually backed down on it, but the president got excited.

54:11.389 --> 54:14.753
And so that the Scholarly Technology Group exists.

54:14.773 --> 54:18.917
The old CHUB Group is now hired as Scholarly Technology Group.

54:19.792 --> 54:29.241
And they share half the space with us, and we have a multimedia lab that they've built, and we have a classroom which is all out, mainly.

54:30.002 --> 54:40.652
And we're in conjunction with the music department, the art department, and modern culture media, and in computer science.

54:41.572 --> 54:49.680
And history's a little bit involved, and actually anthropology got involved with us, too.

54:50.133 --> 54:50.814
It's a committee.

54:50.874 --> 54:52.215
I mean, it's just people volunteering.

54:52.235 --> 54:57.482
We just, those of us who teach us get together and decide what to do and how to find money for it.

54:57.502 --> 54:59.684
And we don't have any departmental money to call on.

54:59.764 --> 55:03.388
We have to go straight to the administration or to other sources.

55:03.489 --> 55:04.650
AT&T's been helping us.

55:05.130 --> 55:08.374
So which department, ostensibly, do you work out of that?

55:08.554 --> 55:11.858
How long have you been teaching?

55:12.359 --> 55:13.740
About 20 years.

55:13.761 --> 55:16.324
You said at Brown.

55:16.444 --> 55:19.347
I think you said at Princeton as well.

55:19.630 --> 55:22.475
Well, I had these little gigs for a lot of different schools.

55:23.637 --> 55:28.865
I lived on the writing, and then my kids were college age.

55:28.925 --> 55:32.491
So I went back to look for more permanent work.

55:32.591 --> 55:36.778
I moved to Provincet and had a lot of friends.

55:37.028 --> 55:41.374
I didn't have a job or anything, just moved on.

55:41.474 --> 55:47.241
And taught at Brandeis for stuff, other objects, and teaching around before we got involved.

55:47.382 --> 55:51.908
And so you're from Indiana originally, or in Rio, Indiana?

55:51.928 --> 55:54.771
I never took 10, so it was something I refused.

55:54.871 --> 55:59.357
It's an old 60s angle, but I always refused that.

55:59.377 --> 56:03.643
When Bucks retired, they tried to put me this job, and I refused that.

56:04.028 --> 56:08.996
I've always been a contract player, so I'm just now getting my contract removed for like six years.

56:09.096 --> 56:12.641
Now that I'm 66, I've got a contract through in 72.

56:12.661 --> 56:16.728
That's great.

56:16.808 --> 56:21.214
Mark, it's fascinating, you know, I'm going to leave you in just a minute.

56:21.234 --> 56:21.615
Other side.
