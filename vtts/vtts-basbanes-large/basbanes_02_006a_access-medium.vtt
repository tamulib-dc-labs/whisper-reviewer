WEBVTT

00:03.862 --> 00:08.311
The Macbeths?

00:08.331 --> 00:12.399
Well, Shakespeare would not be the first man of the theatre to say to his family, there is a world elsewhere.

00:12.459 --> 00:25.566
There's my acting, there's my writing, and there is London, where Richard Burbage had his company of players, eventually to have their own theatre, The Globe, on the unfashionable South Bank of London, right opposite St Paul's Cathedral.

00:27.183 --> 00:38.996
surrounded by bear baiting pits, cockpits, brothels, and the screams of animals and the shouts of men and women floating up through the London air, in through the open roof of the round, circular Globe Theatre.

00:40.338 --> 00:47.947
Simple wooden structure holding maybe as many as 2,000 people in tiers around the stage, some of them standing up, pushed up against the front of the stage.

00:48.727 --> 00:52.752
Hardly any scenery, the barest of costumes, and no artificial lighting.

00:52.934 --> 00:59.103
And under those conditions, an actor might be tempted to overact because all the focus of attention is on him and on the words he speaks.

01:01.807 --> 01:08.056
The actors must persuade the audience to listen, to be an audience, and not the spectators who just watch.

01:09.478 --> 01:18.250
The audience must use their imagination and use yours now as you picture the Globe Theatre empty, except for the actors who have just finished a final run-through of a play and

01:18.533 --> 01:25.743
are gathered around the front of the stage waiting for the final notes of advice from the author or director, as actors still do to this day.

01:28.928 --> 01:44.671
Speak the speech, I pray you as I pronounced it to you, trippingly upon the tongue, that if you mouth it as many of our players do, I had as leaf the town crier spoke my last.

01:47.735 --> 01:47.815
Hmm?

01:49.988 --> 02:13.043
nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness oh it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig fated fellow tear a passion for tatters

02:13.968 --> 02:20.237
very rags to split the ears of the grandlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise.

02:21.259 --> 02:24.664
I would have such a fellow whipped for or doing termagant.

02:24.684 --> 02:26.446
It out Herod's Herod.

02:26.466 --> 02:27.548
Pray you avoid it.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.994
Be not too tame, neither.

02:32.896 --> 02:35.299
But let your own discretion be your tutor.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.883
Suit the action to the word.

02:40.529 --> 02:43.913
the word to the action, with this special observance.

02:44.634 --> 03:05.777
Let you o'erstep not the modesty of nature, for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at first and now, was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the times,

03:07.158 --> 03:09.923
his own form and pressure.

03:09.943 --> 03:10.585
Off you go.

03:10.605 --> 03:11.166
Break a leg.

03:11.186 --> 03:11.687
See you later.

03:11.927 --> 03:25.774
And the actors go to prepare, and the audience arrives to prepare for the first performance of, let's say, Shakespeare's Life of King Henry V. Enter the chorus, played perhaps on this occasion by the author himself.

03:34.968 --> 03:46.222
Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention, a kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene.

03:46.663 --> 03:50.267
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars.

03:51.609 --> 03:59.058
And at his heels, leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire crouch for employment, but pardon gentles all.

03:59.899 --> 04:03.203
The flat, unraised spirits that have dared on this

04:03.942 --> 04:07.906
unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object.

04:07.926 --> 04:12.390
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?

04:13.471 --> 04:21.118
Or may we cram within this wooden earl the very casks that did affright the air at Attencourt?

04:24.401 --> 04:30.827
But pardon, gentles, since a crooked figure may attest in little place a million and let us

04:31.027 --> 04:37.897
ciphers to this great account on your imaginary forces' work.

04:37.917 --> 04:47.851
Suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high upreared and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.

04:48.232 --> 04:50.375
Peace out our imperfections with your thoughts.

04:50.675 --> 04:55.482
Into a thousand parts divide one man and make imaginary piercings.

04:56.508 --> 05:10.603
Think when we talk of horses that you see them printing their proud hoofs in the receiving earth, for tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, carry them here and there, jumping o' time, turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.

05:11.364 --> 05:25.840
For the witch supply, admit me, chorus to this history, who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray gently to hear, kindly to judge our play!

05:41.530 --> 05:49.279
Shakespeare's first great smash hit was a play about King Henry V's son, King Henry VI of England, and so successful was it that he had to write two sequels.

05:49.660 --> 06:04.758
And striding through the three plays is his first great character, an ambitious, self-regarding politician who will stop at nothing and no one to achieve his ends, a man who will eventually rival Stalin or Hitler with his tyranny.

06:04.878 --> 06:10.845
But because, like all Shakespeare's villains and like all his heroes, he talks directly to the audience,

06:11.872 --> 06:20.803
Because he confesses to you his deepest desires, because he makes you smile and laugh, you begin to sympathize with him, even to like him.

06:22.425 --> 06:31.636
As the young Duke of Gloucester confesses to you that he is miscast by nature and would like to play the star role of King Richard III.

06:33.938 --> 06:38.844
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard.

06:39.004 --> 06:41.187
What other pleasure can the world afford?

06:45.453 --> 06:54.762
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap and deck my body with gay ornaments to which sweet ladies with my words and looks.

06:57.265 --> 07:01.369
A monstrous fault and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.

07:01.589 --> 07:01.909
Why?

07:03.931 --> 07:08.956
Love forswore me in my mother's womb and for I should not deal in her soft laws.

07:09.437 --> 07:14.802
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink my arm up like a withered shrub.

07:17.330 --> 07:21.918
To make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body.

07:23.060 --> 07:25.844
To shape my legs of an unequal size.

07:27.828 --> 07:36.162
And disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlicked bare wealth that carries no impression like the dam.

07:36.182 --> 07:37.865
And am I then a man to be beloved?

07:39.688 --> 07:42.072
No monstrous fault to harbor such a thought.

07:43.823 --> 07:53.220
And since the world affords no joy to me but to command, to check, to or bear such as are a better person than myself, I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown.

07:54.081 --> 08:01.675
And whiles I live to account this world of hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown.

08:03.017 --> 08:07.806
And yet I know not how to get the crown, for many lives stand between me and home.

08:08.528 --> 08:20.582
And I, like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns, seeking the way, yet straying from the way, not knowing how to find the open air, torment myself to catch the English crack.

08:21.002 --> 08:25.828
And from that torment I will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe.

08:29.873 --> 08:32.055
Why, I can smile.

08:35.917 --> 08:38.360
And murder whilst I smile.

08:39.061 --> 08:42.845
And cry content to that which grieves my heart.

08:42.865 --> 08:45.308
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears.

08:47.971 --> 08:50.514
And fray my face to all occasions.

08:51.255 --> 08:54.038
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall.

08:54.539 --> 08:57.322
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk.

08:57.342 --> 08:59.385
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor.

08:59.725 --> 09:01.988
Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could.

09:02.428 --> 09:04.911
And like a Sinon, take another troif.

09:06.612 --> 09:15.063
I can add colors to the chameleon, change shapes with Proteus to advantages, and set the murderous Machiavell to school.

09:15.744 --> 09:18.147
Can I do this, and can I get a crown?

09:23.434 --> 09:24.415
Were it further off?

09:28.801 --> 09:30.223
Up, lock it down.

10:01.321 --> 10:03.224
It's difficult to forget Laurence Olivier, isn't it?

10:04.305 --> 10:08.171
It's the trouble about playing these great parts is that somebody always got there before you.

10:09.253 --> 10:19.548
When I was playing Hamlet, there had been ten other Hamlets that season in London, and I sympathised with the Cambridge Don who once said to me, I never want to see Twelfth Night again unless it's done by Archangels.

10:22.072 --> 10:25.557
Richard Burbage was the luckiest actor of all because he was the first Hamlet.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.484
The first Henry V, the first Coriolanus, the first Othello, can you imagine it?

10:31.342 --> 10:32.743
and the first Richard III.

10:32.763 --> 10:40.211
There's a little bit of gossip that's come down to us about Burbage and about Shakespeare which I hope is true.

10:40.251 --> 10:43.014
It's recorded in a diary of 1602.

10:43.855 --> 11:00.893
When Richard Burbage played Richard III there was a certain citizen grew so far in liking with him that before she went from the play she appointed him to come that night unto her

11:01.193 --> 11:03.375
by the name of Richard III.

11:06.118 --> 11:21.152
Shakespeare, overhearing their conclusion, went before, was entertained and at his game before Burbage came, then word being brought that Richard III was at the door.

11:21.192 --> 11:30.441
Shakespeare caused return to be made that William the Conqueror was before Richard III.

11:31.349 --> 11:32.711
Oh, I do hope that's true.

11:33.652 --> 11:38.499
Let's go back to King Henry V when he was still young Prince of Wales.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.061
Prince Hal.

11:41.022 --> 11:46.410
Playing in the East End of London with his friends Bardolph, Pitot, Poins and Sir John Falstaff.

11:46.910 --> 11:57.865
Playing in the sense of playing around and in this scene in the sense of play acting as Falstaff and Hal take it in turns to play Hal's father, the king.

11:58.306 --> 11:59.247
Do thou stand...

12:00.188 --> 12:04.392
For my father and examine me on the particulars of my life.

12:06.154 --> 12:06.755
Shall I?

12:08.897 --> 12:16.444
Content, this chair shall be my state, this dagger my scepter, and this cushion shall be my crown.

12:18.766 --> 12:25.453
And give me a cup of sack to make mine eyes look red, that it may be thought that I have wept, for now I must...

12:26.227 --> 12:30.893
speak in person, and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein.

12:31.054 --> 12:37.943
Now, Harry, I not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, I also marvel how thou art accompanied.

12:37.963 --> 12:44.151
Shall the son of England prove a thief, and take purses, a question to be asked?

12:46.515 --> 12:52.082
There's a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of Pitch.

12:53.464 --> 12:54.225
This Pitch

12:54.695 --> 13:00.080
As ancient writers do report, doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest.

13:01.021 --> 13:10.310
And yet, Harry, there is a virtuous man whom I've often noted in thy company, and yet I know not his name.

13:10.330 --> 13:21.040
A goodly, portly man, if any, and the corpulent of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage.

13:21.543 --> 13:30.754
And as I think his age, some fifty, or by Our Lady inclining to three score, and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff.

13:31.996 --> 13:34.499
If that man be lewdly given, he deceiveth me.

13:34.539 --> 13:37.483
For Harry, I spy virtue in his looks.

13:38.063 --> 13:40.707
Him keep with, the rest banish.

13:40.727 --> 13:43.450
And now tell me, thou naughty varlet,

13:43.953 --> 13:46.575
Tell me whist thou been this month?

13:46.655 --> 13:48.377
Dost thou speak like a king?

13:48.437 --> 13:49.638
Do thou stand for me?

13:50.098 --> 13:51.680
And I'll play my father.

13:52.340 --> 13:55.243
Now, Harry, the complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

13:55.283 --> 13:57.545
Thou art violently carried away from grace.

13:57.805 --> 14:01.308
There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of a fat old man.

14:02.429 --> 14:04.531
A ton of man is thy companion.

14:04.771 --> 14:07.373
Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours?

14:08.134 --> 14:10.315
That bolting hutch of beastliness?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.318
That swollen parcel of dropsies?

14:13.737 --> 14:16.264
That huge bombard of sack.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.894
That stuffed cloak bag of guts.

14:19.914 --> 14:22.862
That roasted manning tree ox with the pudding in his belly.

14:23.544 --> 14:26.312
That reverend vice, that gray iniquity.

14:26.984 --> 14:30.068
That father ruffian, that vanity in years.

14:30.169 --> 14:33.073
Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it?

14:33.113 --> 14:36.317
Wherein neat and cleanly but to cut a capon and eat it?

14:36.578 --> 14:37.980
Wherein cunning but in craft?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.422
Wherein crafty but in villainy?

14:39.442 --> 14:41.204
Wherein villainous but in all things?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.808
Wherein worthy but in nothing?

14:45.731 --> 14:50.117
That old abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff.

14:50.137 --> 14:55.084
That old white-bearded Satan, my lord.

14:56.228 --> 15:15.420
The man I know, but to say that I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know, that he is old, the more the pity his white hairs do witness it, but that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster that I utterly deny.

15:16.622 --> 15:20.869
If sugar and sack be a fault, God help the wicked.

15:21.524 --> 15:26.791
If to be old and merry be a sin, many an old host I know is to be damned.

15:27.652 --> 15:30.015
If to be fat, be to be hated.

15:30.996 --> 15:34.240
Why, then pharaohs lean kind are to be loved.

15:34.260 --> 15:38.765
No, my good lord, banish Bardolph, banish Peto, banish poems.

15:39.046 --> 15:44.933
But kind Jack Falster, true Jack Falster, sweet.

15:45.368 --> 15:46.469
Jack Falstaff.

15:46.749 --> 15:49.352
Valiant Jack Falstaff.

15:49.372 --> 15:53.215
And the more valiant being as he is, old Jack Falstaff.

15:53.235 --> 15:56.138
Banish not him, thy head is company.

15:56.158 --> 15:59.241
Banish not him, thy head is company.

16:00.642 --> 16:03.665
Banish plump Jack.

16:03.685 --> 16:06.308
And banish all the world.

16:09.191 --> 16:09.571
I do.

16:13.675 --> 16:13.975
I will.

16:16.334 --> 16:29.395
And true to his word, when Hal becomes King Henry V, he does banish false staff from his sight, and the old fat knight declines and dies, as his dear friend Mrs. Quickly tells you.

16:33.181 --> 16:34.823
Now, sure, he's not in hell.

16:34.843 --> 16:36.186
He's in Arthur's bosom.

16:36.286 --> 16:43.978
If ever a man went to Arthur's bosom, he made a finer end and went away, and he'd been any Christian char...

16:45.764 --> 16:49.370
He parted even just between twelve and one, even at the turning of the tide.

16:50.512 --> 16:59.868
For after I saw him humble with the sheets, and play with flowers, and smile at his fingers' ends, I knew there was but one way.

17:00.870 --> 17:06.199
For his nose was as sharp as a pen, and he baffled of green fields.

17:07.562 --> 17:10.607
And now, Sir John, quote I, what may be of good cheer,

17:13.135 --> 17:15.840
Now he cried out, God, God, God, three or four times.

17:16.881 --> 17:18.885
I, to comfort him, bad him he shouldn't think of God.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.549
I hope there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.

17:21.589 --> 17:25.697
And he bad me put more clothes on his feet.

17:28.381 --> 17:34.211
I put my hand into the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone.

17:34.231 --> 17:35.213
And I felt to his knees.

17:37.797 --> 17:38.839
So upward and upward.

17:42.380 --> 17:55.228
And all was as cold as F. Stone.

17:55.248 --> 18:02.143
Of course, Mrs. Quickly was written to be played by a man because Shakespeare worked in a theatre where there were no actresses, just men and boys.

18:03.187 --> 18:09.656
And what lad unparalleled was it who was first given the responsibility of playing Viola, Imogen, Rosalind?

18:09.756 --> 18:13.781
It's no wonder those girls get into britches as soon as possible, is it, and walk through the plays as boys.

18:15.203 --> 18:20.170
But that still leaves the undisguised femininity of Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Juliet.

18:22.473 --> 18:24.035
Boy actors to wonder at.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.001
And here is Shakespeare's 20th sonnet.

18:29.523 --> 18:32.046
Not easy, perhaps, to understand at first reading, but

18:32.515 --> 18:39.684
When heard out loud, it becomes, I think, like all Shakespeare's sonnets, a little heartfelt speech.

18:44.471 --> 18:53.763
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted, hast thou the master mistress of my passion?

18:55.925 --> 19:01.813
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted with shifting change as is false women's fashion.

19:02.452 --> 19:08.938
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling, gilding the object whereupon it gazeth.

19:09.739 --> 19:19.289
A man in hue, all hues in his controlling, that steals man's eyes, and women's souls amazeth.

19:21.391 --> 19:27.717
And for a woman wert thou first created, till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting.

19:28.422 --> 19:35.310
and by addition me of the defeated, by adding one thing to my purpose, nothing.

19:37.372 --> 19:48.444
But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure, mine be thy love, and thy love's use their treasure.

19:52.849 --> 19:55.392
And so to Shakespeare's first indisputable masterpiece,

19:56.350 --> 20:01.956
A play like the sonnets, full of love, full of wit, full of imagery, full of easy rhythms and rhymes.

20:04.518 --> 20:06.580
A playwright in love with the English language.

20:06.660 --> 20:10.684
And Romeo and Juliet, too, are in love with words.

20:10.724 --> 20:11.725
They're great talkers.

20:11.745 --> 20:21.615
When I played Romeo, we discovered at Stratford that Romeo and Juliet are on stage together for only 14 minutes out of the two hours traffic of their stage.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.518
Of course, they never stop talking about each other.

20:24.970 --> 20:37.032
Because they're working in a theatre where there's no artificial light, their words must describe the light, the moonlight, the starlight, the sunlight, the lamplights, lanterns, candles, and colours too.

20:37.833 --> 20:42.822
The black of night, the white of dear Juliet's hand, the crimson of her lips, her cheeks, and the blood.

20:44.465 --> 20:44.725
Blood.

20:46.569 --> 20:49.594
This is a play about death as much as it is a play about life.

20:50.485 --> 20:56.632
And they meet in The Lovers, because on Romeo's first entrance into the play, he's thinking and feeling that death is in the air.

20:57.192 --> 21:05.942
And he almost knows that after his first ecstatic meeting with Juliet and their secret marriage and his banishment and his return, that he will commit suicide.

21:08.224 --> 21:10.467
Life and death meet in one word in the play.

21:10.867 --> 21:14.271
It's a play full of puns, and here's a double meaning that is easy to miss these days.

21:15.412 --> 21:17.995
The verb to die means not only to expire,

21:19.223 --> 21:29.841
to end life, but for the Elizabethans it had the other meaning of achieving a sexual climax, the very pinnacle of life.

21:29.861 --> 21:43.965
And so, two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona, where we lay our scene, from ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

21:44.502 --> 21:54.997
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, whose misadventured piteous overthrow do with their deaths.

21:56.018 --> 21:58.221
Bury their parents' strife.

21:59.343 --> 22:03.128
I dreamt a dream tonight.

22:03.148 --> 22:14.003
My mind misgives some consequence, yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night's revels and expire the term of a despised life closed in my breast.

22:14.405 --> 22:16.948
with some vile forfeit of untimely death.

22:20.292 --> 22:23.175
But he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail.

22:26.679 --> 22:32.906
She doth teach the torches to burn light.

22:32.926 --> 22:41.475
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear, beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.

22:42.670 --> 22:47.855
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady or her fellow shows.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.856
Did my heart love till now?

22:50.877 --> 22:54.480
Forswear its sight, for I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

22:55.381 --> 23:00.566
But so, what like through yonder window breaks, it is the east and Juliet is the sun.

23:00.646 --> 23:08.332
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid art far more fair than she.

23:08.853 --> 23:11.395
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

23:12.556 --> 23:15.701
Her vestal livery is but sick and green.

23:17.024 --> 23:18.887
A number of fools do wear it, cast it off.

23:18.907 --> 23:20.870
It is my lady, oh, it is my love.

23:22.794 --> 23:24.577
Oh, that she knew she were.

23:24.597 --> 23:29.024
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.

23:31.248 --> 23:36.537
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might touch that cheek.

23:36.557 --> 23:37.078
She speaks.

23:40.383 --> 23:45.470
Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

23:45.490 --> 23:51.339
Deny thy father and refuse thy name, or thou wilt not be but sworn, my lover, I'll no longer be a Capulet.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.544
It is but thy name which is mine enemy.

23:55.285 --> 23:57.107
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

23:57.147 --> 23:57.868
What's Montague?

23:57.888 --> 24:03.156
It is nor hand, nor foot, nor face, nor arm, nor any other part belonging to a man.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.598
Oh, be some other name.

24:04.678 --> 24:07.502
What's in a name that which we call a rose?

24:07.582 --> 24:10.086
By any other name would smell as sweet.

24:10.252 --> 24:16.842
so Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, retain that dear perfection which he owns without that title.

24:17.543 --> 24:23.612
Romeo, doth thy name, and for thy name, which is no part of thee, take all myself.

24:23.692 --> 24:25.735
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds.

24:25.975 --> 24:31.884
Toward Phoebus' lodging, such a wagoner as Fearton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night.

24:32.285 --> 24:39.195
Immediately spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink.

24:39.175 --> 24:43.421
and Romeo leap into these arms, untalked off and unseen.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.464
Come, knight.

24:48.048 --> 24:48.769
Come, Romeo.

24:51.013 --> 24:57.422
Come a day and night, for thou will lie upon the wings of night, whiter than you, snow on a raven's back.

24:59.345 --> 25:01.008
Come, gentle knight.

25:01.128 --> 25:03.712
Come, loving, black-browed knight.

25:03.892 --> 25:07.377
Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die,

25:10.816 --> 25:25.240
Take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.

25:25.260 --> 25:36.739
These violent delights have violent ends which in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume.

25:38.626 --> 25:44.273
Hence from Verona out thou banish should be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

25:45.194 --> 25:48.618
There is no world without Verona walls but purgatory, torture.

25:49.980 --> 25:58.951
Hell itself, heaven is here where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her, but Romeo may not.

25:59.292 --> 26:06.000
More validity, more honorable state, more courtship, live in carrion flies than Romeo.

26:06.503 --> 26:12.349
They may seize on the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips.

26:13.931 --> 26:26.885
This may flies do, when I from this must fly, and say so yet, that exile is not death, hath thou no poison makes, no sharp ground night, no sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, but banish it to kill me.

26:27.886 --> 26:31.450
Banish it?

26:31.470 --> 26:34.013
Thou couldst not speak of what thou dost not feel.

26:35.022 --> 26:49.299
Were thou as young as I, Juliet, thy love, an hour but married, Tybalt's murderer doting like me and like me banished, then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground as I do now, taking the measure of an unmade grave.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.301
A grave.

26:51.321 --> 26:55.586
And now a lantern.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.692
For here lies Juliet.

27:02.579 --> 27:09.989
And her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence.

27:10.009 --> 27:14.394
Full of light.

27:14.414 --> 27:18.159
How often men are at the point of death have they been married.

27:20.803 --> 27:23.546
Which their keepers call a lightning before death.

27:24.868 --> 27:28.272
Oh, how may I call this a lightning?

27:28.292 --> 27:28.873
Oh, my love.

27:31.840 --> 27:41.110
My wife, death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

27:41.150 --> 27:47.778
Thou art not conquered.

27:47.798 --> 27:51.942
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

27:53.344 --> 27:56.447
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

27:56.988 --> 27:59.991
Oh, Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?

28:00.595 --> 28:13.894
shall I believe that insubstantial death is amorous and that the lean, abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour for fear of that I still will stay with thee and never from this palace of them not depart again.

28:13.934 --> 28:21.945
Here, here will I remain with worms that are thy chambermates.

28:23.022 --> 28:33.260
Here will I set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world where it flashed skies.

28:33.501 --> 28:39.592
Lift your last arms, take your lasting breath, and lips.

28:39.612 --> 28:45.402
O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss, a dateless bargain to engrossing death.

28:48.166 --> 28:50.709
Come, bitter conduct.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.471
Come, unsavory guide.

28:53.011 --> 28:56.175
A desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks.

28:56.315 --> 28:57.897
I see sick, weary bark.

28:58.477 --> 28:59.398
Here's to my love.

29:04.544 --> 29:07.347
True apothecary.

29:07.367 --> 29:08.488
My drugs are quick.

29:10.411 --> 29:18.139
But with a kiss, I'm fine.

29:25.426 --> 29:32.515
the glooming peace this morning with it brings, the sun for sorrow, will not show his head.

29:33.936 --> 29:37.561
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.

29:38.322 --> 29:47.653
Some shall be pardoned and some punished, for never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
