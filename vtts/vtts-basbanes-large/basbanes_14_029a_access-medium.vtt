00:01.921 --> 00:07.149
Anyway, congratulations, Professor.

00:11.655 --> 00:25.035
I'd like to start just talking in general about the art, the craft translation.

00:25.696 --> 00:26.678
Let's enter it this way.

00:27.739 --> 00:30.223
Do you believe that every generation...

00:30.811 --> 00:34.797
requires, say, its own Homer, its own Dante, its own Shakespeare.

00:34.818 --> 00:36.420
I don't think there's any question of that.

00:36.741 --> 00:40.787
Our notion of poetry is always changing.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.470
Our notion of Homer is always changing.

00:43.412 --> 00:47.418
Our notion of what constitutes English poetry is always changing.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.181
But I think there's another side to that, too.

00:50.383 --> 00:56.633
Every generation needs its own translation because they're looking for the timely translation.

00:57.305 --> 01:00.970
At the same time, as you well know, there's much about Homer that is timeless.

01:02.572 --> 01:20.375
And so much as you want to be relevant, with it, current to your own idiom, there's another aspiration too, I think, and that's to catch by contagion some of Homer's timelessness.

01:21.336 --> 01:24.460
And there's always a great example behind you.

01:25.013 --> 01:33.784
Pope's Homer, Dryden's Virgil, Golding's Auburn, which were the great translations for their day, for their generation.

01:33.804 --> 01:39.131
At the same time, they were works of writing in their own right, and they lasted a good long time.

01:39.151 --> 01:40.633
We can anticipate the question.

01:40.673 --> 01:47.342
Well, Pope's Homer was Homer in England, not only for his generation, but for many generations along.

01:47.626 --> 01:49.829
And he still read for much the same reason.

01:49.850 --> 01:51.773
Because it became a work in its own right.

01:51.793 --> 01:53.415
Precisely.

01:53.435 --> 02:01.748
So it's a kind of combination of timeliness and timelessness, I think, which you're really after as a translator.

02:01.768 --> 02:08.118
Especially when you're dealing with one of these people like Homer or Espinosa or Sophocles, who have lingered for very good reasons.

02:08.178 --> 02:12.525
They've endured for a good long time.

02:12.545 --> 02:15.490
So say that, but on the other hand, you don't want...

02:16.769 --> 02:22.196
your translation to be perceived as something that's dated to a particular time?

02:22.296 --> 02:22.816
Not at all.

02:22.977 --> 02:23.217
No.

02:24.018 --> 02:28.664
You would hope and want it to be read 50 years, 100 years from now?

02:28.784 --> 02:30.005
You would want to.

02:30.085 --> 02:31.287
You would, of course, want that.

02:31.307 --> 02:32.308
Yes, you would.

02:32.328 --> 02:35.472
It's an immodest code and probably an impossible one.

02:35.492 --> 02:40.999
But I think that any translator in the business entertains that, huh?

02:41.019 --> 02:43.502
Especially when they're dealing with one of these giants.

02:44.782 --> 02:48.689
who in the case of Homer has been around for 2,700 years.

02:48.709 --> 02:52.196
You're always brought up against the question, why has he lasted so long?

02:52.216 --> 03:01.613
And if he's lasted so long, can I create something in English which will not last 2,700 years, but last maybe a little longer than my generation?

03:01.633 --> 03:04.258
It is linked English with language.

03:04.694 --> 03:08.539
Is English a good language for Homer to go into?

03:08.939 --> 03:09.480
I think so.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.541
It's the only one I've got.

03:10.562 --> 03:22.236
Well, I'm just wondering, you know, what he's like in Italian or Russian or... He sort of said, for instance, that Shakespeare plays very well into Russian.

03:22.256 --> 03:26.001
I don't know why that is, but... The Russians think he's better in Russian than in English.

03:26.101 --> 03:29.706
Here we are.

03:31.643 --> 03:38.953
I was reading the great Italian Iliad by Monte, and it's got some marvelous things in it, I think.

03:39.333 --> 03:55.594
But to answer your question, yes, I think there's a kind of easy flow of Homer into English, recognizing at the same time that Homer has a highly inflected language and we don't, that Homer lends himself to hexameters and we lend ourselves more to iambics.

03:55.614 --> 04:00.581
So there are really cultural differences between the two languages.

04:00.601 --> 04:01.482
I think, in fact...

04:02.035 --> 04:10.967
One of the interesting parts of translation is the way you can stretch your own language by virtue of coming into contact with something as enormous as Homer.

04:11.688 --> 04:17.597
It's not only that you want to bring him into your own idiom, you want him to stretch your own idiom at the same time.

04:18.237 --> 04:20.961
I think these things are always two-way streets.

04:21.061 --> 04:27.610
I read something that you had no way meant to do a line-by-line translation.

04:27.630 --> 04:27.911
No.

04:28.011 --> 04:28.752
You might just...

04:29.002 --> 04:32.186
Talk about your philosophy, your attitude on that.

04:32.246 --> 04:42.297
Well, it's a curious combination, I think, of trying to get over into one's English line as much of what Homer says as possible, at the same time creating an English line.

04:42.317 --> 04:44.640
And the two are not necessarily perfect fits.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.143
There are times when a line in Homer will come right over into a line in English.

04:48.924 --> 04:52.629
Other times when you can even find your English briefer than Homer.

04:52.649 --> 04:54.431
Other times when you have to expand a little.

04:55.191 --> 04:55.752
So the...

04:56.255 --> 05:03.565
The idea or even tyranny of a line-by-line translation becomes a kind of straight checker, I think.

05:03.585 --> 05:07.771
It cuts down too much on the pliancy of your own native language.

05:07.791 --> 05:12.217
It forces Homer into too rigid a mold in your own native language.

05:12.237 --> 05:16.463
It would almost be like doing Dante and Tessarima, I think.

05:16.503 --> 05:18.786
You're exposing that on yourself, which I guess... Yes.

05:18.968 --> 05:23.574
And these disciplines are good and healthy, at the same time they can be terrifically frustrating.

05:23.614 --> 05:30.422
I mean, it worked well in Italian, but it's always laughable when you try to... At times, depending on the skill of the translator.

05:30.462 --> 05:41.736
Robert Pinsky did a marvelous Inferno in a kind of off Terzorima that works very well, but he's not imitating Dante's Terzorima exactly.

05:41.851 --> 05:46.076
Do you study other, the work of other translators?

05:46.136 --> 05:50.241
I mean, more or less as a carpenter might, you know, like a carpenter.

05:50.701 --> 05:55.246
And I try not to look at other translations until I have a version of my own.

05:55.266 --> 06:00.973
And that means the 20th, the 30th draft of the same passage.

06:01.353 --> 06:01.734
Really?

06:01.754 --> 06:01.894
Yeah.

06:01.914 --> 06:04.377
Each individual passage?

06:04.397 --> 06:05.418
It takes that many.

06:06.159 --> 06:09.883
I'm an inveterate tinkerer, and the computer gadgetry...

06:10.117 --> 06:11.939
makes tinkering, as you must know.

06:12.079 --> 06:13.201
Oh, I live by it.

06:13.762 --> 06:14.182
I love it.

06:14.202 --> 06:15.123
Yeah.

06:15.143 --> 06:16.485
Easy and irresistible.

06:17.166 --> 06:23.874
So, yes, I always was an inveterate tinkerer, but in a manuscript as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey, hard on the hands.

06:24.495 --> 06:27.779
Did you do this translation on the computer?

06:27.799 --> 06:28.480
I did.

06:28.500 --> 06:28.800
Wow.

06:29.661 --> 06:30.362
I did.

06:30.422 --> 06:31.704
Oh, I can do something with that.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.245
That's great.

06:32.685 --> 06:32.945
Well.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.127
I love that.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.491
Let's just get in the rough sludge out.

06:37.927 --> 06:42.172
And the real joy is when I'm working a hard copy with a pencil.

06:42.192 --> 06:45.816
So the first few might be on the computer.

06:46.637 --> 06:47.298
You do a printout.

06:47.598 --> 06:48.078
That's right.

06:48.899 --> 06:53.625
I find the computer wonderful in that regard because it sort of limbers you, loosens you.

06:53.665 --> 06:56.988
The speed and delivery is so great.

06:57.008 --> 07:00.793
And the way you can, it's so forgiving too, isn't it?

07:00.813 --> 07:01.133
Nice.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.110
It's absolutely forgiving.

07:03.131 --> 07:10.829
You can go back and quietly make corrections that nobody will ever know.

07:10.849 --> 07:18.548
But isn't it paradoxical in a way that you have this 2,700 year old pair of epic poems?

07:19.220 --> 07:24.405
given a new life or an extended life to a reason.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.486
It is remarkable.

07:25.566 --> 07:27.027
It does give one pause, doesn't it?

07:27.047 --> 07:33.373
It gives one pause, and you can bet your bottom daughter that if Homer had that technology, he would have used it too.

07:33.393 --> 07:36.396
Do you see him as a person in your mind's eye?

07:36.416 --> 07:39.960
I can't help but see him as a person, as one person, in fact.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.661
And he is one.

07:41.781 --> 07:43.303
And he wrote poems as well?

07:43.323 --> 07:44.364
That's how it feels to me.

07:45.124 --> 07:47.927
I think that's because I'm an impurable romantic.

07:48.380 --> 07:58.055
What I mean by that is that I'm committed to Keats' notion of the great writer, the Shakespeare... Is that picking me up at all?

07:58.075 --> 07:59.898
Yeah, sure it is.

08:01.601 --> 08:05.527
Yeah, that's better.

08:06.829 --> 08:09.413
Keats said of Shakespeare that his mind was a thoroughfare.

08:09.854 --> 08:13.560
He could imagine equally an Imogene from Cymbeline and an Iago.

08:13.810 --> 08:15.372
the personification of evil.

08:15.812 --> 08:18.655
In other words, all experience came into his ken.

08:19.235 --> 08:23.459
And I think the span from Miliad to Odyssey is something like all of experience.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.643
And that's why I'm committed to a single Homer.

08:28.604 --> 08:40.696
I think even if there weren't a single Homer, it becomes a necessity for the translator, who's working on both poems, to maintain some kind of consistency of voice while moving from the world of war to the world of peace.

08:41.277 --> 08:42.838
Now, you did them...

08:43.325 --> 08:45.568
nearly at first, and then the Odyssey?

08:45.708 --> 08:51.597
Was this because nearly that's the way they appear, do you think?

08:51.937 --> 08:53.179
It's hard for me to answer.

08:53.199 --> 08:59.909
I think the best answer I can give you is that I had worked for many years in Greek tragedy.

09:00.049 --> 09:08.060
Aeschylus, Sophocles, and the great tragic prototype, really, is Achilles in the Iliad.

09:08.902 --> 09:12.066
And one of the reasons why I went to Homer at all was that

09:12.333 --> 09:14.736
work back to the source.

09:14.756 --> 09:18.501
And the source of Greek tragedy seemed to me to be profoundly the Iliad.

09:19.102 --> 09:25.010
I think that's why I worked so... I went to it first.

09:26.151 --> 09:32.940
And there were... Another more personal reason is that Robert Fitzgerald was a good friend of mine.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.043
And I admire his work very much.

09:36.845 --> 09:40.450
And I've always been captivated by his translation of the Odyssey.

09:40.919 --> 09:48.416
And I felt that if I were to try Homer, I might, if I went back to Delia, have a little more room to maneuver.

09:48.436 --> 09:52.625
It felt easier, better, more natural to do that.

09:52.706 --> 10:00.042
Now, where you respect Fitzgerald and his work, do you see these...

10:00.916 --> 10:06.346
I mean, a real serious reader, reading both of them, all of them.

10:06.366 --> 10:09.491
And is there something to be gained from reading all of these?

10:09.511 --> 10:12.316
I think there's something to be gained from every translation.

10:12.336 --> 10:14.560
I mean, I think that you ignore these things at your peril.

10:15.262 --> 10:19.690
Every translator has a different way of going up the great original.

10:19.710 --> 10:24.358
And if you can put them all together, you may come out with Homer.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.502
Yeah.

10:25.522 --> 10:43.461
Yeah.

10:43.964 --> 10:51.393
as a contemporary writer.

10:51.773 --> 10:57.600
You can go ahead a hundred years or back to a hundred years.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.463
You're really writing about your own time.

10:59.483 --> 11:02.386
Do you feel that's the case when you're translating this class?

11:02.406 --> 11:02.666
Very much.

11:02.727 --> 11:04.409
Are you inevitably bringing in your own time, a world view, I guess?

11:04.429 --> 11:06.151
I think it's inescapable.

11:06.171 --> 11:10.976
It's all the conditions, the language that you and I are speaking, the English that you and I are speaking.

11:10.997 --> 11:12.558
It's a function of what we read.

11:12.578 --> 11:13.920
It's a function of what we hear.

11:14.069 --> 11:16.212
It's a function of what the newspapers tell us.

11:16.833 --> 11:20.459
It's a function of what the great writers, the great modern writers have shown us.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.848
When I'm translating Homer, I've got the Greek with the commentary and the lexicons here.

11:26.509 --> 11:31.878
And I have over here the Derek Walcott and the James Joyce and many other people I could mention.

11:32.519 --> 11:38.288
And the job is to bring them both together 2,700 years apart as they are.

11:38.723 --> 12:03.145
really you have these i mean i don't mean that i have the joy spread out in front of me or the derrick you're mindful it's in my head i spend about as much time reading modern english literature as i do reading ancient greek literature because i think it's a dual responsibility it's a pleasure but i think it's a professional necessity jimmy merrill said that any writer who does not read

12:03.614 --> 12:07.940
fine modern writing is indulging in a high-risk activity.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.721
And I think it's true.

12:09.462 --> 12:17.172
One of the reviewers of the Odyssey suggests that the Odyssey has supplanted the Iliad in our times.

12:17.192 --> 12:18.934
Do you agree with that?

12:18.954 --> 12:20.536
Not for me it hasn't.

12:20.676 --> 12:30.229
And I think especially in our time, coming out of the Cold War and the post-Cold War readjustments, I think the poem of wars is

12:30.749 --> 12:34.474
has as much bearing on our sensibility as the poem of peace, so-called.

12:35.055 --> 12:42.785
Remembering always that there are many tender moments in the Iliad, and there are many brutal moments in the Odyssey.

12:42.805 --> 12:47.291
And suggesting that these are not brutal times is... Madness.

12:47.691 --> 12:48.953
Or blindness, or both.

12:48.973 --> 12:52.558
You can look at the news and look at these hearings going on in South Africa.

12:52.638 --> 12:53.379
Absolutely.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.200
Absolutely.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.783
It's a time of terrible massacre.

12:56.803 --> 12:58.145
Sure.

12:58.165 --> 12:59.727
And hopefully it's centuries, certainly, yes.

13:00.702 --> 13:02.484
Absolutely.

13:02.504 --> 13:07.689
Maybe the worst by far.

13:08.510 --> 13:08.670
Amazing.

13:08.690 --> 13:14.216
This is the Gary Wills piece, I guess I'm thinking of, The New Yorker.

13:14.236 --> 13:18.360
And he's really taken by your attitude towards women.

13:18.380 --> 13:23.866
Is this something, again, that you mindfully... I don't really think so.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.248
I think it's in Homer.

13:26.268 --> 13:28.971
Bernard Knox, who taught Gary Wills, Bernard...

13:29.204 --> 13:31.647
former teacher and now collaborator in three books.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.531
I love his book.

13:34.551 --> 13:45.765
I started to find really a gift, and the privilege of working with that man now for three books is one of the great things this happened to me, and I thank my lucky stars for that.

13:45.925 --> 13:59.042
And Bernard, who taught Gary Wills, said, he was very appreciative of the review and thought it very right, but did think, too, that Gary Wills might have known that, I better not say this,

13:59.225 --> 14:06.695
Bernard has said that he'd been teaching the Odyssey that way since 1948, and I've been reading the Odyssey that way ever since I read it.

14:06.795 --> 14:22.937
I don't mean that the great works of feminist criticism aren't of relevance, indeed they are, but I think it's a question of confirmation and mutual reinforcement, rather than of pointing out things that people who read Homer deeply have never seen before.

14:23.137 --> 14:33.528
I don't mean to, and I won't, in my piece or in my book in any way, but it did seem that Wills is... And I like Wills.

14:33.588 --> 14:33.728
Me too.

14:33.748 --> 14:34.469
I respect Wills.

14:34.489 --> 14:35.229
I have a great respect for him.

14:35.249 --> 14:39.414
He's got a new book out now, and John Wayne went to heaven.

14:39.434 --> 14:39.574
I know.

14:39.594 --> 14:41.215
You know his book on the Gettysburg Address?

14:41.235 --> 14:42.857
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

14:42.877 --> 14:45.780
That's one of the great pieces of literary criticism we have.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.642
In fact, when I did my interview with him, I bought that book.

14:48.145 --> 14:49.186
Oh, great.

14:49.206 --> 14:51.069
Yeah, it's a great book.

14:51.229 --> 14:55.695
This is really a wonderful book.

14:56.035 --> 15:01.823
He mentions, I guess, the thrust of that piece is a politically correct odyssey, you know.

15:01.843 --> 15:05.307
You mean almost by calculation or something like that, or influence?

15:05.327 --> 15:12.957
I think the thrust was, I think the subtext there was the classics are under attack.

15:12.977 --> 15:15.360
And that this is the way to reinforce it.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.523
And that maybe this is the way to retain relevance.

15:17.543 --> 15:17.663
Right.

15:17.812 --> 15:30.027
And, you know, I have to say, I went to a conference here in August, the Association of Literary Scholars.

15:30.048 --> 15:30.768
Yeah, I'm a member of that.

15:30.788 --> 15:32.230
I'll be going to their conference.

15:32.250 --> 15:39.039
And I wonder, how do you feel, if you take your attention to another area, having the suggestion that a book has to be relevant to be read?

15:39.059 --> 15:41.382
I have very mixed feelings about that.

15:41.562 --> 15:42.283
On one hand...

15:43.310 --> 15:45.813
A poem like The Odyssey is relevant.

15:45.833 --> 15:46.934
Shakespeare is relevant.

15:46.954 --> 15:48.135
Shakespeare is relevant.

15:48.596 --> 15:54.262
At the same time, Shakespeare and Homer are infinitely larger than what is relevant to our time.

15:54.963 --> 15:56.625
Maybe I can put it personally.

15:57.426 --> 16:04.314
What drew me to translate The Odyssey, for instance, some of the powerful things, are personal points of reference.

16:05.275 --> 16:08.599
Odysseus finding his mother dead in the underworld.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.140
That was the first thing I translated.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.523
When my mother died, I had to put together a service

16:12.976 --> 16:17.945
20 years ago, I translated that the first time.

16:18.426 --> 16:29.727
The reunion with Odysseus and his father in the orchard in the last book, it's a painful, tortured kind of relationship that has a lot of love and tenderness too.

16:30.568 --> 16:34.035
I enjoyed and endured something of the same thing with my father.

16:35.036 --> 16:35.878
The aspect of

16:36.247 --> 16:40.792
coming of age, telematis, parenting, Odysseus and Penelope.

16:40.812 --> 16:48.140
These are personal tugs, personal points of reference to draw me as they would draw anyone else into the poem.

16:48.160 --> 16:48.601
Relevance.

16:49.242 --> 16:54.908
But once you're in the poem, those things are expanded 10,000 times.

16:55.469 --> 16:58.132
They become epic in their consequences.

16:58.152 --> 17:04.819
They become memorable in the poetic expression which they achieve in ways that our own personal points of references

17:05.137 --> 17:31.397
aren't necessarily day by day so if it's relevance that pulls you into the poem it's the spread of the poem the size of the poem that expands those personal points of reference a hundredfold beyond one's personal experience it's two things then in other words it's relevance on the one hand and great enlargement on the other how do you feel um if you don't mind my my going on i mean the poems

17:31.799 --> 17:41.692
You speak quite eloquently.

17:41.712 --> 17:47.380
I hope so.

17:49.423 --> 17:51.966
I'm not going to embarrass you by asking point by point questions.

17:51.986 --> 17:54.810
That's for me.

17:54.830 --> 17:55.010
Go ahead.

17:55.030 --> 17:55.951
I really much prefer the way we're going here.

17:55.971 --> 17:56.893
What was the question I was just going to ask?

17:56.913 --> 17:57.453
Do you think more relevant?

17:57.473 --> 17:57.994
On the heels of relevance?

17:58.014 --> 17:58.114
Yeah.

17:58.134 --> 17:58.755
I was going off into something.

17:58.775 --> 17:59.376
I'll come back to it for sure.

18:02.309 --> 18:15.947
How do you feel when you hear that, for instance, you can get it from Amherst College two years ago.

18:16.670 --> 18:32.224
graduated a student from Lauderdale in English.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.587
This individual had never taken a course in Shakespeare or Spencer.

18:33.607 --> 18:35.792
The fact that you can get a degree at some liberal arts institution without being expected to have graduated.

18:36.616 --> 18:42.623
I've been concerned by such stories, and especially about a story involving Amherst, where I was a kid and went to college.

18:42.643 --> 18:54.658
I got that story from Scott Thoreau, and I'm going to check it out, by the way, because it does seem rather incredible to me that they would graduate soon from Mali.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.921
I'd like to ask a sneaky question, however.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.604
Did that person not mean Shakespeare?

18:59.624 --> 19:00.305
Do we know that?

19:00.645 --> 19:02.087
You know what?

19:02.107 --> 19:02.728
I'm going to find these things.

19:02.748 --> 19:04.530
This is the journalist in me.

19:05.270 --> 19:15.979
I think that they should be proud of their Sumer Mubarak graduates, and I would like to find the... I was one, and I would like to think of the next generation... And I would like to question him.

19:16.019 --> 19:19.282
I believe that this is a him strategy, whether he or she.

19:20.163 --> 19:21.063
I'd like to know.

19:21.144 --> 19:22.805
I'm going to find out.

19:23.305 --> 19:25.367
I guess what I'm... You know what I'm getting at.

19:25.527 --> 19:26.848
I'd like to ask individual.

19:26.888 --> 19:27.969
Yeah, exactly.

19:28.029 --> 19:28.230
Please do.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.731
Because what I'm getting at is this.

19:30.411 --> 19:34.635
I was interviewed on the McNeil Lehrer program.

19:34.953 --> 19:40.101
And this was just when that report was breaking, and I thought I might be asked a question about such things.

19:40.121 --> 19:44.367
So I checked with some colleagues in the English department at Princeton, where I began.

19:44.447 --> 19:46.550
You heard this story about Amherst, by the way?

19:46.570 --> 19:48.633
I heard the story about Amherst.

19:48.693 --> 19:51.538
The Times wrote these kinds of things up.

19:53.140 --> 19:56.825
And so I asked a few people in the English department, just checking.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.649
I used to be in the English department.

19:59.670 --> 20:03.075
Shakespeare is not required in the Princeton English department.

20:03.175 --> 20:04.116
Is Shakespeare taught?

20:04.396 --> 20:04.757
Yes.

20:05.463 --> 20:07.025
Is Shakespeare enrolled well?

20:07.626 --> 20:08.207
Very well.

20:08.347 --> 20:09.509
And enrollments are rising.

20:11.692 --> 20:12.914
Is Homer required?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.096
Not exactly.

20:14.196 --> 20:14.977
Is Homer read?

20:15.097 --> 20:15.718
Absolutely.

20:15.738 --> 20:19.785
I just finished teaching a course to freshmen, ten of them, in the Iliad and the Odyssey.

20:20.245 --> 20:22.368
What I'm getting at is something very simple, I think.

20:22.449 --> 20:28.357
And I think Phyllis Franklin, the executive director of the MLA, said it best and first.

20:28.377 --> 20:32.023
Something does not have to be required in order to be read.

20:32.303 --> 20:34.727
These things, these Shakespeare, these Homers,

20:35.028 --> 20:36.811
They're too good to go away.

20:37.933 --> 20:40.817
Where I would really... Did you say that?

20:40.837 --> 20:40.938
Yeah.

20:41.018 --> 20:47.027
She said something to the effect that they don't have... Simply because something is not required... Seems to be the... That's right.

20:47.608 --> 20:49.892
The target.

20:49.912 --> 20:53.037
Simply because something is not required doesn't mean it's not being read.

20:53.438 --> 20:56.161
It doesn't even mean it is not being taught in courses.

20:56.442 --> 20:57.523
Where is she, by the way?

20:58.004 --> 21:00.527
She's in New York City, and I don't know what the addresses are.

21:00.547 --> 21:01.328
She's in New York, right?

21:01.348 --> 21:03.431
Yeah, that's where the MLA has it.

21:03.451 --> 21:04.592
She's located down there.

21:04.612 --> 21:04.812
Yeah.

21:05.113 --> 21:07.676
Phyllis Franklin, who's the executive director.

21:08.017 --> 21:08.637
You ought to.

21:08.717 --> 21:10.560
I think I have to do an interview with her.

21:10.580 --> 21:11.161
You ought to.

21:11.261 --> 21:12.763
She's a very intelligent woman.

21:14.024 --> 21:14.705
Okay, I'm sorry.

21:14.765 --> 21:15.126
Nothing.

21:15.426 --> 21:20.172
I was just going to say that these things are too large, too old, too good just to go away.

21:20.624 --> 21:27.411
I sense at my own university, at any rate, an increasing interest, not a decreasing interest.

21:27.431 --> 21:36.179
There's a decrease in the number of times such things are required, but there's an increase in the general interest, the level of interest that they arouse.

21:36.399 --> 21:43.446
I don't know if this is relevant here, but I did that with Neil Simon a few months ago in New York.

21:43.466 --> 21:44.047
Lucky man.

21:44.207 --> 21:45.729
Is he as funny in person?

21:45.789 --> 21:49.332
He's nice, but he's not as funny in person.

21:49.531 --> 21:50.232
But just nice.

21:50.532 --> 21:56.539
It's thoroughly enjoyable.

21:56.599 --> 22:11.575
First of all, he told me, I didn't use it in my column, but I certainly plan to use it in this textbook, because he said that there was a point a couple of years ago, living out on the West Coast, he thought he might like to teach for a year.

22:11.595 --> 22:15.319
And so he contacted Stanford, and he said, you know, this is Neil Simon, would you be interested in my teaching a course in plane writing?

22:15.603 --> 22:18.968
And they said, well, we'd love it, of course.

22:18.988 --> 22:21.011
Are you kidding?

22:21.031 --> 22:21.411
Absolutely.

22:21.431 --> 22:25.937
And then they asked them, how many students do you think would take this course?

22:25.957 --> 22:29.703
And they said, well, the fact is five.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.707
They came back five students.

22:32.727 --> 22:36.372
And they said, what if I would teach a course in script writing?

22:36.392 --> 22:38.515
They said, off the charts, 250, 300.

22:38.535 --> 22:40.418
Of course, I would take anything.

22:40.518 --> 22:43.602
So would I. So would I. So would I. So would I.

22:44.628 --> 22:47.512
I wonder what that says.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.135
Well, it may say that the media are shifting.

22:50.215 --> 22:56.243
I don't mean that this is a time or a culture in which people aren't reading.

22:56.784 --> 22:59.087
God, look at the superstores.

22:59.687 --> 23:03.212
Look at the results of the Iliad and the Odyssey, for that matter.

23:03.232 --> 23:05.114
There's a lot of reading going on.

23:05.134 --> 23:05.735
Isn't that amazing?

23:05.755 --> 23:06.817
It is amazing.

23:06.837 --> 23:07.658
It really is.

23:07.678 --> 23:10.081
And it's reading among the lay public.

23:10.101 --> 23:11.783
It's not a signed reading.

23:12.235 --> 23:14.599
It's reading among the hungry lay public.

23:14.619 --> 23:15.861
These are trade books.

23:15.881 --> 23:20.849
These are trade books, and they're being sold by trade bookstores.

23:22.271 --> 23:23.473
Which is wonderful, isn't it?

23:23.493 --> 23:27.179
I think it's absolutely the most heartening thing you can imagine.

23:27.199 --> 23:28.982
I was just publishing my book, by the way.

23:29.002 --> 23:29.603
Yes, I know.

23:30.224 --> 23:45.160
I had trouble with Random House and they had orphaned me because they didn't take my book for itself.

23:45.180 --> 23:45.421
Misjudgment.

23:45.441 --> 23:49.045
Don't you love it when they make mistakes like that?

23:49.065 --> 23:53.530
But it's kind of a scholarly book and I had an opportunity to go to a wonderful university in Crest.

23:53.630 --> 23:58.375
But I really did want to go to, I guess as a commercial motivation here, I'm a professional writer, but in much larger sense, you really want

23:58.810 --> 24:00.432
the general public.

24:00.532 --> 24:03.577
That must be very satisfying.

24:03.597 --> 24:12.169
It's enormously satisfying because it means that people are reading not just for recreation but to recreate themselves in some way.

24:12.189 --> 24:17.977
There's a real hunger for something they can sink their teeth into and suck some nourishment out of.

24:18.398 --> 24:19.880
It's very heartening.

24:19.900 --> 24:23.145
Now I did an interview with Harold Boomer.

24:23.265 --> 24:25.628
And of course he's

24:25.928 --> 24:49.818
He really fears that when teachers of his generation who are teaching Shakespeare and literature, teachers such as yourself, working with the classics, that when you're no longer on the scene, he just fears that you may not be replaced.

24:49.838 --> 24:50.999
I'm not sure of that at all.

24:51.019 --> 24:52.561
Not with that much reading going on.

24:52.581 --> 24:53.222
I really mean it.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.024
I think, too, that we ought to have a healthier regard for some of the shifts

24:55.325 --> 24:56.006
in media.

24:56.106 --> 25:03.732
I mean by that, The Odyssey is done on a wonderful audio book by Ian McKellen.

25:03.752 --> 25:08.796
And he's a superb actor.

25:08.816 --> 25:12.940
I saw him on Broadway doing Hamadeus.

25:12.960 --> 25:13.760
He did do Hamadeus.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.082
I saw it on Broadway.

25:15.102 --> 25:16.162
It's going to be 20 years.

25:16.182 --> 25:16.603
He'd be awfully good.

25:16.623 --> 25:17.263
I'd like to see him in Hamadeus.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.206
Well, that's caught on very briskly.

25:20.226 --> 25:25.230
They're selling about one tape for every five books.

25:25.666 --> 25:30.853
and the ratio usually goes 1 to 10 or 1 to 20.

25:31.174 --> 25:37.703
This is part of, I think it's part of the Shakespeare revival, which is extraordinary.

25:39.125 --> 25:44.913
It's part of the great cinematic revival of things like Shakespeare, Jane Austen, E.M.

25:44.933 --> 25:48.098
Forster, Henry James, a variety of things.

25:48.118 --> 25:51.262
In other words, it isn't simply a book culture.

25:51.282 --> 25:54.627
It's a culture that has a lot to do, a lot of interest in performance,

25:55.062 --> 26:05.956
a lot of interest in the visual, and we may have to shift our definitions of how, or our notions of how we approach classics, how we suck the nourishment out of them.

26:05.976 --> 26:12.925
But first and foremost, they're books, and they enjoy a very wide currency.

26:12.945 --> 26:18.312
Do you have a, that's a phrase, by the way, book culture, that's in a subtitle, Minus.

26:18.352 --> 26:19.974
Oh, uh-huh.

26:19.994 --> 26:20.715
And do you have a...

26:20.932 --> 26:23.837
When you say book culture, what do you mean by that?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.159
You know, I'm not sure anymore.

26:25.920 --> 26:37.638
And when Penguin decided to put out tapes by Jacobi of the Iliad, I thought this would be maybe interesting, but I was really afraid that such things would cannibalize the book.

26:38.019 --> 26:39.381
And I don't mean in terms of sales.

26:39.461 --> 26:41.885
I mean that it would feel more to the ear than to the eye.

26:43.027 --> 26:46.332
And then I caught myself, and I said, look, Homer was performed.

26:46.733 --> 26:51.900
And if you don't have appetite for Homer in performance, you're not doing your job.

26:52.441 --> 26:57.328
In fact, if your work in the name of Homer can't be performed, then there's something wrong.

26:57.688 --> 27:00.152
And I've enjoyed readings.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.054
I'm giving one tonight.

27:02.876 --> 27:03.897
Is it here?

27:04.017 --> 27:05.059
Yeah, it's at Harvard.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.362
Is this something I could come to?

27:08.483 --> 27:09.505
They're very snooty.

27:09.885 --> 27:11.888
You have to be part of the Harvard community.

27:11.908 --> 27:13.230
And I said, what does that mean?

27:13.379 --> 27:23.115
I'm performing, I'm pretending I'm Homer, and a great actress, Catherine Walker, is Penelope, Athena, and Jason Robards is going to be... It's tonight?

27:23.295 --> 27:23.816
It's tonight.

27:24.617 --> 27:25.679
Can you possibly get in?

27:25.859 --> 27:26.520
I'll show you.

27:26.540 --> 27:31.048
I can get in if I could... If I could... Let me come in.

27:31.969 --> 27:33.211
Can I give you a name and an address?

27:33.492 --> 27:33.872
Sure.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.737
This is all I've got.

27:37.088 --> 27:42.975
I mean, there's a brand new one in Frankfurt, which we haven't heard anything about.

27:43.235 --> 27:45.478
Maybe the most expensive one of all.

27:45.498 --> 27:48.301
We have the brand new French library.

27:48.722 --> 27:51.225
We have the brand new British library.

27:51.265 --> 27:53.267
The Japanese are talking about a big library.

27:53.287 --> 27:55.109
San Francisco, New York, just opened another PSIDL library.

27:55.129 --> 27:58.914
All of this bears out what you and I are saying together.

27:58.934 --> 27:59.635
We can do this.

27:59.655 --> 28:00.075
Oh, yes, please.

28:01.523 --> 28:03.105
I'll call this president.

28:03.185 --> 28:07.249
I'll ask, you know, if it... This is the Harvard program, Learning from Performers.

28:08.710 --> 28:14.676
And the executive director, the coordinator, is one Thomas Lee, L-E-E.

28:15.116 --> 28:22.764
And this is the number.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.326
I'll give it a shot.

28:24.346 --> 28:28.309
Please give it a shot and say that we were talking.

28:28.470 --> 28:28.690
Okay.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.872
I guess this means telephone 617 or not.

28:31.223 --> 28:32.144
617-495-8676.

28:32.285 --> 28:32.705
Okay.

28:32.785 --> 28:37.092
By all means.

28:37.453 --> 28:38.294
What time is it?

28:38.314 --> 28:41.960
It's 8 o'clock at the Agassiz Theatre.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.283
If it's a problem, you know.

28:44.303 --> 28:46.847
I always say you have to be a little bit pushy.

28:46.867 --> 28:47.688
Push away, won't you?

28:47.708 --> 28:48.490
I really mean that.

28:48.510 --> 28:51.454
You can't make almost without breaking eggs, as they say.

28:54.158 --> 28:55.500
I'm sorry.

28:56.522 --> 28:57.043
Where were we?

28:57.183 --> 28:59.847
Oh, we were talking about

29:00.164 --> 29:06.612
the reading public, about the canon, about books, and book culture.

29:08.234 --> 29:11.438
And I began by saying that I'm really not sure anymore.

29:11.919 --> 29:17.446
I don't think it's just a question of people sitting in their private studies reading to themselves silently.

29:17.466 --> 29:29.361
I think there comes upon us a whole performative aspect that we find in the audio book, in television, film adaptations, in musical scores.

29:29.628 --> 29:38.297
In other words, I think there's a great expansion of how old masterpieces of print and word are being absorbed and received.

29:39.238 --> 29:46.044
I don't think it's only books anymore, even though the efflorescence of libraries is something extraordinary.

29:47.205 --> 29:51.309
Do you have any anxiety about the future of the book as we know it?

29:51.850 --> 29:56.935
I don't think you can ever bank on anything, but I derive great heart

29:57.404 --> 30:05.712
from the large bookstore, the proliferation of libraries, the amount of reading going on in the lay public, as you were saying.

30:05.732 --> 30:10.436
With all of that happening, I worry less.

30:11.197 --> 30:13.199
You know, I went up to a university.

30:13.219 --> 30:24.169
I'm going, and my concluding section of this new book will be books and libraries and the future, everything that involves.

30:24.189 --> 30:24.929
I'm just going where the stories are.

30:24.949 --> 30:25.690
For instance, here at Harvard,

30:25.957 --> 30:28.780
There's no such thing as a dead book at Harvard.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.182
That's a matter of policy.

30:30.222 --> 30:37.291
They have a depository out in South Florida where I've been.

30:37.311 --> 30:40.895
It's like a valley of the kings where they put these books down.

30:40.915 --> 30:47.904
And it's universities which are getting rid of books, which are the accessioning books, books that students haven't used in five or ten years.

30:48.284 --> 30:50.687
But all of these are preserved in at least one copy.

30:50.707 --> 30:52.830
Well, here they are.

30:52.850 --> 30:55.373
But I mean, Cornell, for instance, is mandated to...

30:55.572 --> 31:22.069
to cut their collection down to six million copies by the year 2000 and what do they do with the same person some they're they are digitizing and then and then and then disposing of the originals i've seen them do this so i'm not judging but you know this is it's a little like book burning it is isn't it and of course uh once you throw something away it is gone forever

31:23.163 --> 31:26.367
I'm sorry to go off in these tendons.

31:26.387 --> 31:27.949
That's all right.

31:28.269 --> 31:36.198
Oh, yeah, but I... Now, two weeks, we're going to the Media Lab.

31:36.279 --> 31:40.183
Have you ever heard of the MIT Media Lab?

31:40.203 --> 31:40.724
But I've never been in it.

31:40.744 --> 31:42.126
Okay, I'm going over it.

31:42.146 --> 31:44.528
There's a fellow there that has a patent on something that looks like a book.

31:44.548 --> 31:50.976
It will have pages that will appear to be paper, and you can load it with the Iliad or the Odyssey, and it will be...

31:51.327 --> 31:54.411
to all intents and purposes, a book.

31:54.431 --> 31:56.993
Is this something like a cybertext?

31:57.013 --> 31:57.654
I can't.

31:58.595 --> 32:03.721
I think all of these things are causes for alarm whenever books are destroyed, obviously.

32:04.182 --> 32:09.788
I'm just talking about the extraordinary buoyancy, it seems to me, in the public imagination these days.

32:11.109 --> 32:13.352
You know what thrills me?

32:14.210 --> 32:24.204
22% of the American Booksellers Association figures of new books, of trade books sold, are children's books.

32:24.224 --> 32:26.067
Say that again, what percentage?

32:26.087 --> 32:29.231
22, by their recognition, of trade books.

32:30.112 --> 32:39.565
Not of all books sold, but as general publishing, general trade publishing, I think it's up to 22%.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.850
Children's books have never been more...

32:43.336 --> 32:44.778
successful.

32:44.798 --> 32:49.826
And you can imagine the number of those that are in effect performed, I mean by that parent leading the child.

32:50.026 --> 32:51.168
Oh, indeed.

32:51.488 --> 32:54.213
And that's interactive.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.094
That's right.

32:55.114 --> 33:05.931
I'll tell you, I think something else I derive art from, and it became a book too, is the television Civil War series, which I think was really a masterful job.

33:06.552 --> 33:10.137
And certainly it had its visual impact, it had its musical impact.

33:10.505 --> 33:14.151
But above all, it had its linguistic aspect, it seems to me.

33:14.572 --> 33:16.274
That's where the power lay.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.558
The power lay in the language, I think.

33:18.578 --> 33:24.528
And the ability of qualified actors, qualified speakers to speak out that language.

33:24.548 --> 33:25.910
Interestingly paired, too.

33:26.491 --> 33:31.519
Morgan Freeman as Frederick Douglass, Sam Waterston as Lincoln, and so forth.

33:31.539 --> 33:34.564
Arthur Miller as William Tecumseh Sherman.

33:34.644 --> 33:36.327
Wonderful things, memorable things.

33:36.610 --> 33:45.183
In other words, it was certainly a triumph of television, but it was a triumph of language without any doubt at all.

33:45.203 --> 33:55.779
If we can continue this, it comes to showing Homer as a performer, as a vehicle for performance.

33:55.799 --> 33:56.219
Very important to me.

33:56.239 --> 33:57.942
And is this something you have always felt?

33:58.002 --> 33:59.284
Always felt.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.205
Always felt.

34:00.225 --> 34:03.310
Ever since people taught me how to learn Greek.

34:03.661 --> 34:08.008
Sorry, taught me how to speak, not speak Greek, but speak Homer's lines.

34:09.150 --> 34:18.786
Ever since I began to read the Odyssey itself and those scenes in which gods perform in public, this seems to me to be a public activity, a performing activity.

34:19.508 --> 34:22.092
It's not something that we should just be reading, in other words.

34:22.112 --> 34:25.237
We should be hearing, if only in our inner ear.

34:25.257 --> 34:26.139
Pope said this best.

34:26.159 --> 34:29.905
He said, Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.

34:30.425 --> 34:38.213
Homer makes us hearers, H-E-A-R, and Virgil leaves us.

34:39.755 --> 34:42.298
See, that's Pope's peril of them.

34:43.439 --> 34:47.803
Homer makes us hearers, Virgil leaves us readers.

34:48.244 --> 34:49.005
This was Pope?

34:49.025 --> 34:51.087
Yeah, in his preface to the Iliad translation.

34:51.107 --> 34:56.753
In his preface, because I might want to... I'm also going to have a chapter on reading.

34:57.222 --> 34:59.384
marginal notes.

34:59.524 --> 35:02.607
You know, there's a fellow right here at Harvard, Owen Gingrich.

35:02.647 --> 35:04.249
Have you ever heard of him?

35:04.269 --> 35:04.849
Yes, I have.

35:04.869 --> 35:05.930
The great Copernicus, Chase.

35:05.950 --> 35:13.277
He spent 25 years trying to track down every first and second edition in the world, and I think he succeeded, of Copernicus.

35:14.018 --> 35:24.968
And then to study the marginalia, and to determine who the owners of these books were, but particularly the first owners.

35:25.218 --> 35:33.348
because it has been suggested by some, which he's tried, which he has refuted, that this is the greatest book he ever read.

35:33.368 --> 35:35.932
And, of course, it's proven quite the other way.

35:35.992 --> 35:42.480
But, again, it goes back to the book as something more than just paper.

35:42.540 --> 35:52.913
One of my favorite anecdotes along this line is I had an older colleague in the Princeton English Department who was a specialist in the manuscript tradition of Churchill's famous teachers.

35:53.399 --> 36:03.629
And somewhere in the famous blood, sweat, and tears speech, there's a marginal notation by Churchill that says, point weak, yell like hell.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.590
Oh, thanks.

36:05.610 --> 36:06.511
Really?

36:07.472 --> 36:08.153
I love that.

36:09.874 --> 36:10.315
That's wonderful.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.897
Point weak, yell like hell.

36:12.917 --> 36:13.798
That's great.

36:14.359 --> 36:18.062
How about translations that you're thinking about working on now?

36:18.082 --> 36:19.063
What's next for you?

36:19.083 --> 36:19.704
I don't know.

36:19.724 --> 36:22.326
And I've been hanging out in Homer for 20 years.

36:22.981 --> 36:27.507
And I'm weary and suffering from word overload.

36:27.527 --> 36:28.508
But I'm also bereft.

36:29.830 --> 36:37.140
That companionship is still with me, but it's not something I confront necessarily every morning that I wake.

36:37.601 --> 36:40.004
And I don't really know where to turn.

36:40.024 --> 36:44.470
Is it the companionship of Homer or the companionship of the text?

36:44.490 --> 36:45.211
All those things.

36:45.732 --> 36:46.393
All those things.

36:46.413 --> 36:51.840
I don't mean to be mawkish, but there's a great loneliness that sweeps over me.

36:52.175 --> 36:53.616
which my wife knows all about.

36:55.238 --> 37:00.683
Do you see him as a blind person?

37:00.703 --> 37:03.947
I know it's kind of one of these apocryphal tales.

37:03.967 --> 37:09.852
It's apocryphal and compelling, that he should be blind, yet have so much insight, that kind of paradox.

37:10.793 --> 37:14.337
It is... Probably.

37:14.617 --> 37:18.601
We don't know where he was born, but seven cities claimed him as their son.

37:19.141 --> 37:21.844
We don't know what his name meant, either, Homeros.

37:22.043 --> 37:22.664
captive.

37:23.325 --> 37:34.362
Was he a captive of the wars or was he a knockabout and a drifter and a performer and therefore dependent on and even hostage to the kindness of strangers?

37:35.043 --> 37:36.004
I don't know.

37:36.024 --> 37:40.711
How personally did you come to Greek?

37:40.731 --> 37:42.694
That's not difficult for me to place.

37:42.714 --> 37:51.207
I was at Amherst College and we were being taught these great things in translation, great translations, Lattimore's largely, and

37:51.828 --> 37:53.812
And it just seemed like the best literature around.

37:54.312 --> 37:55.434
And I wanted to learn the language.

37:55.955 --> 37:56.717
I liked the teaching.

37:57.258 --> 37:58.720
The teachers were awfully good, too.

37:59.482 --> 38:00.443
The literature was good.

38:00.463 --> 38:01.505
The teachers were good.

38:02.006 --> 38:03.949
And many friends had gone to Greek.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.275
And so I began myself.

38:07.656 --> 38:07.876
Late.

38:08.517 --> 38:11.102
But I began with what Vinnie Lombardi would call desire.

38:12.314 --> 38:14.437
That's great.

38:14.457 --> 38:16.619
Anthony Grafton, of course, is down at Princeton at least.

38:16.639 --> 38:17.420
Remarkable.

38:17.901 --> 38:26.392
And I attended his talk at... If he's coming up here, I hope he's going back to Princeton, Harvard, and trying to get his hooks in the entire world.

38:27.854 --> 38:33.761
Yeah, and I know Roger introduced and Roger started at the Graphical Society, which I attended his talk.

38:33.981 --> 38:34.262
Marvelous.

38:34.282 --> 38:34.642
Oh, he's terrific.

38:34.662 --> 38:37.145
In fact, I'm going to interview him for this new book.

38:37.165 --> 38:37.326
Good.

38:37.346 --> 38:37.846
He's a brilliant guy.

38:37.866 --> 38:38.807
He's just brilliant.

38:38.948 --> 38:40.770
He's kind of all kinds of insights.

38:40.790 --> 38:40.870
Yes.

38:41.407 --> 38:44.512
You teach the classics?

38:44.993 --> 38:47.096
Classics are part of every course I teach.

38:47.597 --> 38:51.823
I teach essentially a course in the epic and a course in tragedy.

38:51.843 --> 38:54.748
And in those courses, the first third is invariably Greek.

38:55.609 --> 39:01.778
Then I go to, in the tragedy course that I'm doing now, a third Shakespeare and a third things modern.

39:02.419 --> 39:07.988
So it's, in many ways, I'm teaching the classical tradition in later English and European letters.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.332
And these are graduate courses or undergraduate courses?

39:10.352 --> 39:11.373
Depends.

39:12.454 --> 39:17.719
Right now I'm teaching a graduate seminar, but either course can go to undergraduates or to graduates.

39:17.739 --> 39:19.101
And they're well attended, I try.

39:19.121 --> 39:20.842
Yeah, they are pretty well attended.

39:21.142 --> 39:22.264
They are.

39:22.284 --> 39:28.990
There was a study commissioned by Dr. Gloria Nebron, which I really wanted to see, about the New York Times.

39:29.010 --> 39:32.133
I'm going to try and get it next week.

39:32.153 --> 39:34.195
What students read today?

39:34.715 --> 39:36.778
You mean just in their spare time?

39:37.058 --> 39:41.685
What they read in their spare time.

39:41.705 --> 39:48.354
Well, I was interested to see the list, the ranked list published by the Princeton University store that has a good stock.

39:49.136 --> 39:52.080
It was the Odyssey, first and foremost.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.683
Call them.

39:54.703 --> 40:02.815
I don't have your number on me, but if you... It's the Princeton University store, which is a major book outlet for students.

40:03.892 --> 40:10.806
and this was a list they published a month or so ago, ask for Charlie Harlick and say that you and I were talking.

40:11.046 --> 40:11.247
Okay.

40:11.447 --> 40:12.369
H-A-R?

40:12.850 --> 40:16.477
I think it's H-A-R-L-E-C-K, but I'm not sure.

40:16.497 --> 40:17.379
Okay, that's fine.

40:17.399 --> 40:19.082
I'm very better at getting it.

40:19.323 --> 40:21.307
What's your time constraint, by the way?

40:21.467 --> 40:24.533
I'm going to be interviewed by Christopher Lydon, whom I don't know at all.

40:24.850 --> 40:26.073
On the radio.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.336
On the connection?

40:27.356 --> 40:28.118
On the connection.

40:28.138 --> 40:29.201
What time is that?

40:29.341 --> 40:31.185
And I should be there around 10.30.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.569
Are you driving?

40:32.689 --> 40:33.792
I'm going to take a cab.

40:34.954 --> 40:35.696
Okay.

40:35.716 --> 40:37.541
If you'd like, I'll be happy to drive you.

40:37.841 --> 40:38.343
Are you sure?

40:38.363 --> 40:40.809
I'm right out here on the street.

40:40.869 --> 40:40.969
Okay.

40:41.303 --> 40:42.664
You don't mind that?

40:42.684 --> 40:42.744
No?

40:42.764 --> 40:44.166
You're going that way?

40:44.286 --> 40:45.747
Actually, let me backtrack, please.

40:45.767 --> 40:46.988
I was going to go over to Widener.

40:47.008 --> 40:47.689
Do it.

40:47.709 --> 40:47.909
Do it.

40:47.969 --> 40:49.431
There's a cab right out there.

40:49.451 --> 40:49.751
Don't bother.

40:49.851 --> 40:51.933
If you don't mind, because actually I was going to go there.

40:51.953 --> 40:55.076
I have to go by an arena's ticket at Widener.

40:55.636 --> 41:01.662
You might, in fact, at the office of that, learning from performances on Mount Auburn Street.

41:01.682 --> 41:02.903
We'll give you the address.

41:02.923 --> 41:04.605
You're probably going to walk right by it.

41:04.625 --> 41:05.005
Okay.

41:05.185 --> 41:06.787
Maybe you can go in and strong-arm the guy.

41:06.887 --> 41:07.868
I'm right out there.

41:10.210 --> 41:16.263
Their address is, which is right down where Pangloss is today, 74 Mount Auburn.

41:16.304 --> 41:17.546
Okay, good.

41:18.769 --> 41:18.969
Excellent.

41:19.290 --> 41:22.397
Well, actually, if you're going over...

41:25.043 --> 41:40.000
This is the connection, the Homer connection, the connection to the Iliad and the Odyssey.

41:40.020 --> 41:43.825
Flashback 3,000 years to the Eastern Mediterranean, the Trojan Wars are just over.

41:43.845 --> 41:44.325
Troy is a smoking ruin.

41:44.345 --> 41:46.528
The wily tactician Odysseus, who won it for the Greeks, is heading home a long way, as it turns out.

41:46.508 --> 42:05.314
This is the way the story for the ages begins in Robert Fayette's new translation and version of Ian McKellen's reading of the Odyssey.

42:05.334 --> 42:08.719
Sing to me of the man who used, the man of twists and turns, driven time and again off course once he hath plundered the hallowed heights of Troy.

42:08.699 --> 42:24.797
Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds.

42:24.817 --> 42:30.783
Many pains he suffered hardship on the open sea, fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.

42:30.803 --> 42:31.985
But he could not save them from disaster hard as he strove.

42:32.005 --> 42:33.086
The recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all.

42:33.106 --> 42:35.989
The blind fools they devoured, the cattle of the sun, and the sun god blotted out the day of their return.

42:36.627 --> 42:58.313
Watch out on his story, Muse, Daughter of Zeus.

42:58.333 --> 42:58.874
Starts from where you will.

42:58.894 --> 42:59.474
Sing for our time, too.

42:59.494 --> 43:03.399
Our guest this hour is a very American poet and translator, Robert Fagles, who has done for the Odyssey now what he did for the Iliad seven years ago.

43:03.419 --> 43:05.942
He has recomposed it in modern English, in music, swift power in lines, in language not to be read so much as to be performed.

43:05.922 --> 43:26.635
Translations are like performances, Robert Fagles has said, and all the great old epics and those parts of Achilles and Hector, Athena and Odysseus and all the rest have to be regularly recast.

43:26.655 --> 43:30.141
Robert Fagles is in a sense the point man for our time of a recasting and huge revival of interest in these ancient stories, in this case the story

43:30.121 --> 43:50.350
of the wandering mastermind Odysseus.

43:50.370 --> 43:52.253
The story of the goddess Calypso who holds him captive and wants to make him a god.

43:52.273 --> 43:53.434
The story of Zeus and Simon who keep tossing Odysseus out.

43:53.454 --> 43:57.400
The story of his weighty wife Penalope who undoes her weaving every night to keep from finishing it because when it's finished she must give up Odysseus for dead and take over Zeus for her husband.

43:57.420 --> 43:58.862
It's the story also of the torment of some telemarchus fidgeting at home

44:02.555 --> 44:16.452
Who would you cast to play Odysseus in the TV series?

44:16.472 --> 44:20.137
Would you let the Disney animators have that the Odyssey?

44:20.157 --> 44:22.199
Seriously, do any of us really know the power of these stories in our culture and in all of our heads?

44:22.219 --> 44:22.760
And do we accept that call?

44:22.780 --> 44:23.961
Give Robert Fulton Bagels a call on the Odyssey Connection.

44:23.981 --> 44:24.462
The phone is 1-800-3255.

44:28.154 --> 44:38.874
Good morning to you.

44:38.894 --> 44:44.664
Yesterday we were talking about George Washington, and it was hard enough to sort of present the father of this country in a sort of PC culture, slaveholder, warrior against the Indians, and that kind of thing.

44:44.684 --> 44:45.606
How do we introduce the father of our culture?

44:45.940 --> 45:04.753
Odysseus is, in a sense, in a PC world, this guy was not only a chauvinist, a warrior, a pirate in a certain way, not to mention a patriarch.

45:04.773 --> 45:05.234
I mean, can we bear it?

45:05.254 --> 45:06.396
Can we handle this guy?

45:06.416 --> 45:08.260
I don't know whether we can handle it or not, but I think we have to bear him.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.243
And what I mean by that is that we shouldn't be too pious about the origins of our culture.

45:10.223 --> 45:30.531
We may look back there and find kinds of savagery, kinds of deviousness of character, kinds of complexity that we never even dreamed of.

45:30.551 --> 45:34.797
Because in addition to us being a wily and tactical fighter, a man with a lot of bloodlust, he's also a man with a lot of tenderness, a man with a lot of social responsibility.

45:34.817 --> 45:36.159
A good father, finally a good husband, and a very good son himself.

45:36.179 --> 45:36.720
In other words, it's a poet

45:36.700 --> 45:56.323
that you want to be PC about, and it's a poem about family values.

45:56.343 --> 45:59.027
But it's a family that has its abrasions, its distance, its heartbreak, as well as its deep affiliations.

45:59.047 --> 46:02.231
Part of the thrill is to realize all that incredibly complex, the complexity of it, the contradictions of it, and the reality of it.

46:02.251 --> 46:02.951
I mean, it's all kind of wonderful.

46:02.971 --> 46:03.192
I think so.

46:03.212 --> 46:04.593
It's kind of wonderful, and it can be read at any stage of our lives.

46:04.613 --> 46:06.015
It will hit us in a different way, from being children to adolescents.

46:05.995 --> 46:19.622
Young, married people, middle-aged people, people on the way out.

46:19.642 --> 46:21.767
Before we get into the story, and back to this man, I wonder if you'd just give us the sound of the Greek.

46:21.787 --> 46:22.468
We hear the sound of your English.

46:25.216 --> 46:42.055
been working from all these years.

46:42.075 --> 46:48.101
Would you give us the sound of it as you imagine Homer told this tale?

46:48.121 --> 46:50.123
Well, this is a series of educated guesses, but this is something, what it's like, what it sounds.

46:50.143 --> 46:53.367
Andromoyere mamusa, polutropon hosmala pola, plongteapey troyes, hieron toliathrona persa, polondantropon, iranastia kainoane klo, polodogem panto, apenalkia von

46:53.347 --> 47:18.851
It sounds great.

47:18.871 --> 47:19.812
There are two things we're going to talk about.

47:19.832 --> 47:21.694
We're going to talk about this story, and all the stories in it, but then also the character.

47:21.714 --> 47:22.054
Odysseus himself.

47:23.283 --> 47:43.549
I was just reminding myself in recent days reading it that Odysseus renamed Ulysses.

47:43.569 --> 47:44.550
He's a major character in Dante's Defiant Comedy.

47:44.570 --> 47:44.870
He's a villain.

47:44.890 --> 47:45.191
He's a bad guy.

47:45.211 --> 47:47.173
He's shouting away there on the lower surface of hell.

47:47.193 --> 47:47.574
He was a trickster.

47:47.594 --> 47:48.154
He was untrue fundamentally.

47:48.174 --> 47:49.476
And he's restored in Tennyson's poem under Odysseus in a way that

47:49.979 --> 47:51.825
also has to be dealt with.

47:51.926 --> 47:53.190
He is the modern seeker.

47:53.290 --> 48:00.495
He's also the emblem of Kennedy politics, and we'll come back to that too.

48:02.855 --> 48:17.788
connection listeners to consider who you're tasked to play Odysseus.

48:17.808 --> 48:19.531
Well, you know, he's been cast, don't you, in a television series that's coming up?

48:19.551 --> 48:19.612
No.

48:19.632 --> 48:19.932
Let me guess.

48:19.952 --> 48:20.193
Bill Gibson.

48:20.213 --> 48:20.453
Guess again.

48:20.473 --> 48:20.754
Harrison Ford.

48:20.774 --> 48:20.894
Again.

48:20.914 --> 48:21.235
Kenneth Branagh.

48:21.215 --> 48:37.399
Sean Connery of 20 years ago.

48:37.419 --> 48:41.505
All of these are wonderful suggestions.

48:41.526 --> 48:42.187
How would you like Armand Asante?

48:42.207 --> 48:43.028
Don't know Armand Asante.

48:43.048 --> 48:44.310
The last time you saw him was on HBO playing John Gotti.

48:44.330 --> 48:44.710
Interesting.

48:44.730 --> 48:46.273
Jack Palance, I think, would have been good, again, 20, 30 years ago.

48:46.293 --> 48:49.197
Yes, but you see, Palance, only in those moments when the Odysseus is using poisoned arrows or being especially cruel, being especially sardonic.

48:49.177 --> 48:52.825
My question would be if Palin's how much tenderness does he have?

48:54.914 --> 48:59.200
How much of a loyal husband does he have?

48:59.220 --> 49:01.723
He's got the abs.

49:01.823 --> 49:03.065
He's got the back.

49:03.165 --> 49:07.871
Because he can do one-arm push-ups at the age of I don't know what.

49:07.971 --> 49:09.433
He might take the part yet.

49:10.495 --> 49:17.244
No, but seriously, these are important roles, and I hope people will have suggestions.

49:17.344 --> 49:24.313
I also want to tell you who's going to play him this afternoon, or rather this evening, at the Agassi Theater, Jason Robards.

49:24.293 --> 49:27.258
And that should be something very interesting to hear.

49:27.318 --> 49:29.902
Great voice, but he can't do push-ups with one hand.

49:32.166 --> 49:33.468
Here's a connection, too.

49:33.548 --> 49:37.875
Camille Paglia was here last week, and she's deep into this sort of stuff.

49:38.035 --> 49:47.550
I mean, she says many wonderful things about Homer, but among other things she says about the Odyssey, this is for the distaffs.

49:48.239 --> 49:50.043
Connection listeners.

49:50.064 --> 49:53.272
The masculine glamour of the Iliad is gone.

49:53.332 --> 49:56.660
When we first see the hero of the Odyssey, he is weeping.

49:56.700 --> 50:03.978
The ruling virtues of this poem are female perception and endurance rather than aggressive action.

50:04.399 --> 50:05.522
This is the woman's

50:06.802 --> 50:07.303
Lucy.

50:08.245 --> 50:11.630
I like that very much, but I don't think it's exclusively the woman's book.

50:11.711 --> 50:18.022
I think that what we have to keep in mind is that women are given equal time with men, equal impressively, equal power.

50:19.043 --> 50:22.690
But I don't think it's a poem lacking in masculinity either.

50:23.171 --> 50:31.425
It's a wonderfully androgynous kind of poem, where Fielding called The Eating Ethic, I'd like to think of it as the most married poem we have.

50:31.844 --> 50:33.867
This is all interesting.

50:33.887 --> 50:35.210
I mean, you talk about androgynous.

50:35.230 --> 50:41.380
Athena comes in and out of the story, the goddess, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a woman.

50:41.981 --> 50:48.031
All the female roles are critically important.

50:48.051 --> 50:56.465
Go back, though, to the central figure of Odysseus, and I ask the question who would play him, not quite widely or mysteriously.

50:56.586 --> 50:58.088
I mean, the role is so

50:58.658 --> 51:22.877
subtle uh and so multiple really uh what would you have to if you were directing this as a movie uh what would you be telling your actor i would tell my actor first and foremost to listen to the tapes with which we began because i think that ian mckellen presents the whole range of that character in a kind of brilliant way i think that's one of the best uh

51:22.857 --> 51:27.596
The best ways to cast this poem, I'd like to see Ian McKellen play him, in fact.

51:27.616 --> 51:31.652
If he cannot do that, I'd like to see him direct some other actor in it.

51:32.223 --> 51:37.508
But what would you be telling him about the ranges of this guy?

51:38.169 --> 51:53.384
I mean, for example, this is a man who has to shoot all the suitors, kill them all, when he comes back home, bloodthirstily, absolutely triumphantly, as sort of a physical exploit.

51:53.805 --> 51:59.150
And then he's got to have this unbelievably tender reunion with his wife.

51:59.270 --> 52:00.812
He's got to convince his wife

52:00.792 --> 52:09.181
that in fact he is who he is, and then they've got to disappear back to the telltale bed and make love.

52:09.201 --> 52:10.144
I mean, this is...

52:12.166 --> 52:13.869
This is a big assignment.

52:13.909 --> 52:16.493
This is an enormous assignment.

52:16.513 --> 52:26.369
Pound was fond of saying or suggesting in the ABCs of reading that Bach and Homer are the only two places where you can get it all, meaning all of human experience.

52:26.389 --> 52:27.170
Isn't that amazing?

52:27.310 --> 52:28.973
I thought that was my thought, seriously.

52:28.993 --> 52:33.400
Yes, I think that, well, take it, because it's certainly an awfully good one.

52:33.420 --> 52:36.064
I've been seeing around here, Jan-Sébastien Roth,

52:36.044 --> 52:38.347
We had no music before him and none after him.

52:38.367 --> 52:42.492
We had plenty for all nations of all time.

52:42.692 --> 52:46.938
And at the same time, Hallmark was exactly the same way.

52:46.958 --> 52:49.801
Gary Lewis had that wonderful quotation from G.K.

52:49.821 --> 52:51.884
Chesterton on Sunday.

52:51.904 --> 53:01.737
Chesterton saying that for expressing the depth of the human spirit, the last man alive could do no better than to quote the Iliad and die.

53:02.037 --> 53:02.578
This is enough.

53:02.598 --> 53:03.959
This is enough for all time.

53:04.019 --> 53:05.241
Precisely so.

53:05.221 --> 53:10.249
Do you know the anecdote about Joyce and Frank Budgen?

53:10.610 --> 53:10.790
No.

53:10.870 --> 53:16.960
Joyce first conceiving of Ulysses, or a figure to copy from, imitate from great literature.

53:17.501 --> 53:20.146
And he asked Budgen, who's the most complete man, you know?

53:20.426 --> 53:21.508
And Budgen, the artist,

53:21.488 --> 53:28.777
I asked, do you mean complete in the sense of sculpture, seen every which way, or complete in the sense of his character all around?

53:29.438 --> 53:31.460
And Joyce said, I mean both.

53:31.520 --> 53:35.144
Seen from all sides, and a man who has every facet in him.

53:35.405 --> 53:38.428
That's what you would have to convey in the character of Odysseus.

53:38.589 --> 53:40.791
Everything going from savagery to civilization.

53:41.212 --> 53:45.657
Everything from deviousness to a kind of inwardness of the heart.

53:45.637 --> 53:46.699
Quite extraordinary.

53:46.719 --> 53:51.506
There's no emotional note that's not sounded in that character.

53:51.907 --> 53:55.432
And no emotional note that's not answered in the person of his wife, Penelope.

53:55.873 --> 53:58.176
It's a remarkable value.

53:58.196 --> 54:02.964
He's also created a character that other great artists and poets could sort of work with all the time.

54:02.984 --> 54:06.008
I want to go back to the Tennyson form of Ulysses.

54:06.569 --> 54:12.458
And again, this resonates because it figures in Robert Kennedy's speeches after John Kennedy was dead.

54:12.478 --> 54:13.500
And it's the model of

54:14.155 --> 54:27.989
Odysseus or Ulysses as the first kind of explorer, the first a crutch for Columbus, the first scientist, the first everything, the first American, the first guy to head west, the first frontiersman.

54:28.149 --> 54:37.598
But he says in the poem, in Tennyson's poem, Ulysses, and this is Ulysses speaking, he says, I cannot rest from travel.

54:38.479 --> 54:40.401
I will drink life to the leaves.

54:40.421 --> 54:41.462
I've forgotten who said that.

54:41.999 --> 54:43.221
We'll drink life to the leaves.

54:43.661 --> 54:53.074
But at the end, he says, and this is the sort of the Kennedy part, he says, come, my friends, tis not too late to seek a newer world.

54:54.016 --> 54:56.519
Though much is taken, much abides.

54:57.140 --> 55:06.673
And though we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are one equal temper of heroic hearts,

55:07.531 --> 55:14.781
made weak by time and fate, but strong in will to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

55:15.422 --> 55:17.324
Wonderful sense of indomitability, isn't it?

55:18.085 --> 55:20.148
The world before you, yes.

55:20.368 --> 55:22.090
And Odysseus before that.

55:22.191 --> 55:30.822
Robert Fagel is the translator who has remapped, retold, retuned this story in modern English.

55:31.291 --> 55:43.613
And it's part, not only it's the sequel to his magnificent translation of the Iliad, but it's part of a very broad and interesting recolonizing of this whole story.

55:43.633 --> 55:49.063
3,000 years old, this story, and as vital today as it ever was.

55:50.512 --> 55:54.998
Still, the question in connection is, who would you let play the part in the TV series?

55:55.098 --> 55:56.319
1-800-423-8255.

55:57.681 --> 56:01.546
Betty is calling from Medford, Massachusetts.

56:01.746 --> 56:01.806
Hi.

56:01.826 --> 56:02.347
Good morning, Betty.

56:02.367 --> 56:02.607
Hello.

56:02.788 --> 56:03.208
Good morning.

56:04.330 --> 56:14.302
First of all, I wanted to say that I've been teaching high school for a few years, and we do the Odyssey as part of our required reading, and students love it.

56:15.143 --> 56:19.489
They respond in so many different ways, and I have the most interesting discussions

56:19.469 --> 56:24.477
or offshoots of the actual content with the Odyssey more than any other piece of literature.

56:24.677 --> 56:28.683
Betty, be specific about the reactions, what they say, what they do, what they draw, how they act.

56:28.703 --> 56:30.726
Well, we talk a lot about what's a hero.

56:31.467 --> 56:36.074
You know, yesterday you had that conversation about George Washington and about his flaws.

56:36.755 --> 56:44.387
And I think most of the time, the good thing about the Odyssey is you can come to the conclusion that someone can be a hero and admirable and be flawed.

56:44.447 --> 56:45.108
That's fine.

56:45.689 --> 56:46.210
Yeah.

56:46.230 --> 56:48.413
I agree with that.

56:50.755 --> 56:56.963
But I did have a question, because one of the things we did talk about, there's two issues.

56:57.103 --> 57:00.407
We use an abridged version in our anthology.

57:00.468 --> 57:04.052
More and more, I team teach with a gentleman.

57:04.393 --> 57:07.837
He brings in Fitzgerald's translation.

57:07.857 --> 57:09.960
It is a beauty.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.101
Yeah.

57:11.201 --> 57:12.443
Well, you know, I saw...

57:15.916 --> 57:40.355
The other thing is we do talk a lot about whether Odysseus is a good leader of men.

57:40.415 --> 57:41.316
He seems to make a lot

57:43.068 --> 57:52.945
Sometimes he's brilliant, and other times I'm thinking, for example, why can't he persuade his men at Ismaris to get on the boat and leave?

57:52.965 --> 57:54.628
Why do they disobey him sometimes?

57:54.709 --> 57:56.151
Good question.

57:56.251 --> 57:59.978
I think the only answer is that they're a greedy bunch of pirates in their own way.

58:00.759 --> 58:08.012
Maybe one of the questions ought to be, does he learn through his mistakes, or does he keep on making the same kind of mistake over and over again?

58:08.549 --> 58:10.693
Well, yeah, that's another question.

58:10.713 --> 58:15.203
We take a look at opening his big mouth when the polytheem is nice and bad.

58:15.223 --> 58:15.824
That's right.

58:15.844 --> 58:18.309
He does it once and the price is very high.

58:18.349 --> 58:19.612
I'm not sure he does it again.

58:19.672 --> 58:20.854
That would be my point.

58:21.340 --> 58:22.802
Yeah, maybe not.

58:23.783 --> 58:24.724
You're a good teacher.

58:24.764 --> 58:25.885
That's clear.

58:26.005 --> 58:30.291
I'm just thinking as you speak about that thing, what about Ross Perot to play Ulysses?

58:30.771 --> 58:32.013
Oh, no.

58:32.293 --> 58:39.081
If I had to pick somebody, I don't think physically he's right, but the cleverness and the... But he got his guys out of the run.

58:39.642 --> 58:39.742
Huh?

58:40.042 --> 58:41.524
He did get his guys out of the run.

58:41.544 --> 58:45.629
Well, I think his guys got his guys out of the run.

58:45.649 --> 58:47.591
Ulysses is also having a profession to be solid.

58:47.631 --> 58:48.512
Cleverness.

58:48.610 --> 58:49.071
Pardon me?

58:49.091 --> 58:49.852
Say it again, Betty.

58:49.872 --> 58:52.115
I like Kevin Kline's cleverness.

58:52.135 --> 58:53.477
That's a nice thought.

58:53.617 --> 58:55.320
He's a fine actor.

58:55.340 --> 58:57.984
He's an underrated actor.

58:58.024 --> 58:58.725
Kevin Kline.

58:59.306 --> 59:02.090
What about Kevin Costner after Waterworld?

59:02.130 --> 59:05.295
He's too Gary Cooper-ish.

59:05.315 --> 59:07.758
Maybe he's not good enough with language.

59:08.479 --> 59:09.241
You've got to speak.

59:09.261 --> 59:11.424
You've got to speak with a full range of tone.

59:11.504 --> 59:13.166
I think Kevin Kline can do that.

59:13.206 --> 59:14.989
I'm not sure about Kevin Costner.

59:15.222 --> 59:16.565
Betty, thank you.

59:16.585 --> 59:17.426
1-800-423-8255.

59:17.687 --> 59:21.514
Betty, seriously, hats off.

59:21.534 --> 59:23.718
That's the work of the Lord to teach.

59:23.738 --> 59:24.700
Indeed it is.

59:24.720 --> 59:26.464
It's the way you do it.

59:26.544 --> 59:26.744
Bravo.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.307
1-800-423-8255.

59:28.407 --> 59:32.175
Melinda is calling from Providence, Rhode Island.

59:32.195 --> 59:32.595
Hi.

59:32.615 --> 59:33.156
Morning, hello.

59:34.419 --> 59:34.479
Hi.

59:34.499 --> 59:35.020
How about Patrick Stewart?

59:35.405 --> 59:36.667
Patrick Stewart's wonderful.

59:36.707 --> 59:40.874
And in fact, Patrick Stewart was one of the first persons we thought of as the reader.

59:41.155 --> 59:44.120
Patrick Stewart had one too many movie contracts.

59:44.821 --> 59:44.921
Yeah.

59:44.941 --> 59:46.644
Well, he's always leading some sort of ship.

59:46.664 --> 59:47.265
Yes, he is.

59:47.285 --> 59:48.206
Exactly so.

59:48.227 --> 59:48.727
The mariner.

59:49.028 --> 59:49.809
The ship guy.

59:49.949 --> 59:52.914
I have to admit, I haven't read the Odyssey.

59:52.934 --> 01:00:00.467
However, my experience with the Iliad is from your Ian McKellen, the translation, the book on tape.

01:00:00.447 --> 01:00:09.784
And although I'm not that familiar with Greek mythology, after listening to it, my whole family listened to it in the car on trips.

01:00:10.405 --> 01:00:12.188
I'm just completely hooked.

01:00:12.588 --> 01:00:16.355
And after that, I really wanted to find out more about the Odyssey.

01:00:16.676 --> 01:00:24.750
And the reason I like this story is because I think it was a woman, I saw this sort of personification of...

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:27.754
human frailty in the men.

01:00:28.514 --> 01:00:46.215
And what I saw in Odysseus was sort of this, the voice of reason, if you will, amidst a lot of the rage and egos and jealousy and all those things that were going on between the gods and the people and everybody.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.569
Okay, we're going to go to the other side now.

01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:00.936
Put the radio right back on.

01:01:03.525 --> 01:01:08.963
I'm thinking about Patrick's...
