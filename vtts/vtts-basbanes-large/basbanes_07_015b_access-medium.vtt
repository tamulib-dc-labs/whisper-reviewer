WEBVTT

00:03.811 --> 00:05.413
The Lilly Library, yeah.

00:05.433 --> 00:08.537
Would you order, if you order... See the collection of bindings.

00:08.677 --> 00:17.769
The bindings, and ask to see the bindings of the opposite of the Doney book.

00:17.970 --> 00:18.631
Okay.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.233
I'll tell you why.

00:20.253 --> 00:31.067
There was a, a squash dealer had people do them.

00:32.009 --> 00:34.052
a series of them, they were going to sell them.

00:35.694 --> 00:43.244
And then Randall, who was then the head man there, bought them all, and they're all in the Loyola Library.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.787
I've got pictures of them.

00:45.807 --> 00:48.811
I'm going to get to Columbia, are you?

00:48.891 --> 00:51.034
That's another place I want to get to you.

00:51.054 --> 00:51.755
Not this trip.

00:52.756 --> 00:54.919
Love to see that film.

00:54.939 --> 00:57.122
I guess I'd just like to talk a little bit about

00:57.794 --> 00:59.456
What makes a person collect?

01:00.277 --> 01:01.218
I don't know.

01:01.238 --> 01:05.524
I think they have to be a little mad.

01:06.425 --> 01:07.026
You think so?

01:08.308 --> 01:08.568
Yeah.

01:09.149 --> 01:21.965
Well, I think I can say for us that she had collected... I had collected one man, a poet in England.

01:22.246 --> 01:25.610
But I had four or five books.

01:25.630 --> 01:27.092
And which poet was that?

01:27.882 --> 01:30.165
Yeah, I can't give you his name.

01:30.245 --> 01:31.906
Okay, let's go.

01:32.107 --> 01:35.310
Yeah, the one who wrote about him.

01:35.330 --> 01:35.430
Okay.

01:35.811 --> 01:42.398
Yeah, and she had collected, well, you tell me.

01:42.418 --> 01:43.419
Houseman.

01:43.439 --> 01:43.860
Oh, A.E.

01:43.880 --> 01:44.340
Houseman.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.083
Yeah, that's what I had.

01:47.103 --> 01:50.127
Good for you.

01:50.147 --> 01:51.368
But that was all.

01:52.850 --> 01:55.813
And she had collected...

01:56.215 --> 01:58.758
My so-called... I kept one.

02:00.319 --> 02:03.763
I went to an auction sale when he was away, once a small one.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.224
He was hyped up at a present.

02:06.005 --> 02:11.411
And I came home with a book which absolutely I had no interest in and anything else.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.553
It was a little large form of book.

02:13.653 --> 02:18.918
And I have kept that book to teach me never to bid up at an auction.

02:18.978 --> 02:19.539
It's in here.

02:19.779 --> 02:22.662
Never to bid you kept that to teach you to never... Why?

02:23.097 --> 02:24.358
Oh, it was a silly book.

02:24.378 --> 02:29.263
No, I really didn't need it or want it, but it was carried away.

02:29.443 --> 02:30.524
No, it was just a book.

02:30.704 --> 02:32.086
Did you spend a lot of money for it?

02:32.366 --> 02:34.388
In those days, it was considered a lot.

02:34.408 --> 02:35.329
Yeah, but you wanted it.

02:35.649 --> 02:46.399
No, well, I don't know why I couldn't, but I had it, and I didn't really, well, we didn't really want, but it's around the Attacad.

02:46.779 --> 02:48.181
And remember, don't bid.

02:49.382 --> 02:52.165
But you've gotten a lot of pleasure from the collection over the years?

02:52.185 --> 02:52.665
Oh, yes.

02:53.405 --> 02:59.514
How do you, tell me if you can, if you can articulate it, how a collection like this gives you pleasure?

02:59.554 --> 03:03.400
Even Mr. Rosenthal or Mrs. Rosenthal.

03:03.420 --> 03:12.194
Well, I like to sit down now and then, pull down a book and look it over and remember when I got it and how we got it.

03:13.576 --> 03:14.538
Whether I like it.

03:15.679 --> 03:19.045
Some of them you don't, you get, you don't like after a few years.

03:20.126 --> 03:20.627
I had that.

03:21.012 --> 03:23.535
Sam doesn't agree with me.

03:24.617 --> 03:28.222
We had a Haggadah we got from Zeke.

03:29.523 --> 03:32.067
And I thought it was great.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.011
And a year later, I couldn't look at the thing.

03:35.031 --> 03:36.212
And I still don't like it.

03:36.453 --> 03:44.363
So, I mean, it's a matter of... You have to live with things for a while before you really know whether you like them or not.

03:44.383 --> 03:45.345
What are you going to say?

03:47.267 --> 03:49.450
Well, you know, why don't I study it?

03:50.071 --> 04:09.349
First you buy books to read, and then if you like them very much and they come out in a different fashion, you may want to have that.

04:09.950 --> 04:18.238
But over a period, then you wish you'd bought some book, and you try to get them.

04:19.366 --> 04:24.772
And gradually it becomes a disease.

04:24.792 --> 04:25.713
It becomes a disease.

04:26.774 --> 04:27.935
That's what it is.

04:28.736 --> 04:32.040
To the extent that you feel you have to have something.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.463
No, you'd like very much to have them.

04:35.163 --> 04:40.129
And if they were up to a certain price, we'd buy them.

04:40.709 --> 04:45.795
Have you ever gone over what you thought you should be doing?

04:46.957 --> 04:48.619
I'm afraid so.

04:49.199 --> 04:49.960
I'll say it again.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.982
Have you ever spent more than you thought you should?

04:54.645 --> 04:55.046
Yes.

04:56.908 --> 05:10.923
On the 1970 bindings of French bindings, we became very enamored of them.

05:10.943 --> 05:14.567
And we would take them

05:15.273 --> 05:17.956
And we didn't have to pay for them immediately.

05:17.996 --> 05:19.278
They'd bill us later.

05:19.858 --> 05:21.921
We could either take them or they'd ship them.

05:23.382 --> 05:27.567
And when it added up, well, I've been looking at it now.

05:28.348 --> 05:31.412
I don't know how we did it.

05:32.132 --> 05:36.457
And we didn't do other things, and we had the book.

05:37.839 --> 05:40.622
And then it becomes really a disease.

05:41.243 --> 05:42.985
We don't buy very much now.

05:43.724 --> 05:45.687
There's no way to play it.

05:46.528 --> 05:51.395
In other words, you deprive yourself of other comforts, shall we say.

05:52.015 --> 05:52.556
That's right.

05:53.117 --> 05:54.719
Not comfort.

05:55.380 --> 05:59.325
No, things that you do or not do.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.732
But you never regret, I gather, getting the books.

06:04.312 --> 06:06.295
No, I regret the books I didn't get.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.618
Really, you regret the books you didn't get.

06:09.219 --> 06:11.142
It's true.

06:11.182 --> 06:13.545
I mean, we should have gotten it.

06:14.892 --> 06:18.236
I get very conservative every now and now.

06:18.276 --> 06:20.119
Yeah, we won't tell you about the book.

06:21.080 --> 06:28.009
But in several instances, and then we had him, and then it comes out in his business.

06:28.049 --> 06:30.872
So the thing about this collection is you both share the passion.

06:31.914 --> 06:39.884
You see, there are a lot of collectors whose wives think they're crazy, you know?

06:39.984 --> 06:42.587
But what's great about this, I think, is that

06:42.803 --> 06:44.805
You enjoy this collection as a couple.

06:46.107 --> 06:47.469
That goes so well.

06:48.169 --> 06:55.618
There have been books that she wanted to buy that I didn't give a damn whether we had.

06:55.639 --> 07:03.428
And I came to like them very much, and vice versa.

07:03.448 --> 07:10.937
At the same time, there aren't too many books that we bought that we regret.

07:11.778 --> 07:17.746
I gather if there's a focus, it's that you love books that are beautiful.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.851
I mean, it seems to me that... If they're well printed.

07:22.052 --> 07:26.998
If they're well printed, you're buying books as works of art, it seems to me.

07:27.018 --> 07:28.380
Is that correct?

07:28.400 --> 07:28.901
You are.

07:28.921 --> 07:31.484
Well, we did a lot of reading.

07:32.846 --> 07:33.827
We still do.

07:33.887 --> 07:38.173
But we didn't care whether it was a first edition or anything.

07:38.474 --> 07:41.898
And I think first editions are for the birds.

07:41.958 --> 07:44.420
So you've never sought out first editions?

07:44.521 --> 07:46.282
I did before I knew what I was doing.

07:46.883 --> 07:47.103
Really?

07:47.123 --> 07:48.965
So you think that's a foolish enterprise?

07:49.166 --> 07:50.107
No, I don't.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.049
Not for those who like to do it.

07:52.149 --> 07:53.530
If you're doing research.

07:54.511 --> 07:56.734
A first edition is very important.

07:58.275 --> 08:02.700
Like for instance Whitman, he kept changing things.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.304
So did Thoreau and Melville.

08:06.976 --> 08:09.659
That's the point that people forget.

08:09.679 --> 08:11.922
They want first editions.

08:11.942 --> 08:19.070
First editions are important when it's a second edition.

08:21.312 --> 08:26.618
But the second edition has changes from the first.

08:27.579 --> 08:34.367
But a second printing, which people take for as against a first printing,

08:35.242 --> 08:50.578
Well, taking Scott Tirog's books as a book, you'd get just as much from the third printing of the book, because he never changed it.

08:50.658 --> 08:54.161
If they change it in an edition.

08:55.062 --> 08:58.666
Now, Melville, they did, and that's why— They changed the title.

08:58.686 --> 09:00.928
That was published in England first as The Whale.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.573
And then it became Moby Dick.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.538
Actually, those were different books.

09:08.439 --> 09:16.509
We've had a collator here at Newberry, and we've compared them.

09:16.529 --> 09:18.871
He changed them on the second printing.

09:19.172 --> 09:23.457
So that's a different book.

09:23.723 --> 09:29.109
So textually they change, and therefore they become more of your signature.

09:29.129 --> 09:29.269
Yeah.

09:29.330 --> 09:32.653
That, to me, they're important, but that you've got the word.

09:33.334 --> 09:36.398
Where there are—look at that aircraft up there.

09:39.762 --> 09:47.491
They're up—if there's a difference in the printing.

09:47.951 --> 09:52.937
For instance, they put in most books today, you know, first printing, second.

09:53.508 --> 09:55.210
third printing.

09:55.230 --> 10:03.661
If all that is is a reprint, there shouldn't be any difference in the value of it.

10:04.001 --> 10:07.666
So therefore it has no interest to you as a collector or as an artifact.

10:07.986 --> 10:09.248
Yes, no.

10:11.551 --> 10:23.025
I guess what I'm driving at is that the content, though you both love to read and you both do read, when it comes to collecting books, it's not really...

10:23.849 --> 10:27.032
What is written in them that makes it interesting to you as an object?

10:27.052 --> 10:30.776
Well, that is completely so with bindings.

10:31.477 --> 10:47.814
Now, we have bindings, which are books that have Modigliani, things in it, and lots of the others in the books.

10:47.834 --> 10:51.738
I was looking at a binding that we got, and I blessed the book.

10:51.758 --> 10:53.400
It was a privately printed book.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.421
I've got a key roast one.

10:55.762 --> 10:58.585
If I'd read this first, I wouldn't even have bought it.

10:58.605 --> 11:00.027
It was such a stupid story.

11:00.047 --> 11:01.048
It was a French book.

11:05.554 --> 11:05.975
Okay.

11:06.335 --> 11:09.439
I'm just trying to see if I have any other things I wanted to ask you.

11:10.421 --> 11:13.545
You mentioned that you, when we chatted on the phone, that you knew John Fleming.

11:14.506 --> 11:15.067
Oh, sure.

11:15.447 --> 11:18.732
What did you think of him as a dialect?

11:18.752 --> 11:20.514
We never dealt with him.

11:21.195 --> 11:22.136
Oh, is that right?

11:22.156 --> 11:22.797
No, we've been with him.

11:22.979 --> 11:32.673
And he wasn't our kind of a—no, there was a fellow in New York who knew more about books than he did.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.815
He felt douche-ness.

11:33.835 --> 11:34.716
Yeah, douche-ness.

11:34.816 --> 11:35.798
Douche-ness.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.944
We never made a mistake with douche-ness.

11:39.964 --> 11:47.435
But the other man really didn't know as much, but he knew.

11:48.417 --> 11:52.783
But he had a man that's still collecting.

11:53.489 --> 11:58.876
that they got a list of the best first editions the land should have.

11:58.916 --> 12:09.591
And the Grolier Club has given lists of things, you know, books early on.

12:09.611 --> 12:14.358
Well, we didn't do that.

12:14.378 --> 12:16.861
I say first editions are like olives.

12:17.302 --> 12:19.965
You become accustomed to them.

12:19.985 --> 12:22.669
I think with Blimey, it's a question of

12:23.138 --> 12:24.780
Personalities.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.942
With Fleming, it's a question of personalities, yeah.

12:28.344 --> 12:30.046
First editions are like columns.

12:30.066 --> 12:30.987
I just want to get that.

12:31.327 --> 12:33.029
You've become accustomed to them, right?

12:34.611 --> 12:35.111
It's great.

12:37.374 --> 12:44.081
But, Phil, we had—Phil was not easy to get along with, but he had—he knew an awful lot about books.

12:44.101 --> 12:46.243
So did Lucian Goldsmith.

12:46.644 --> 12:49.767
We got things through him.

12:49.787 --> 12:52.470
We have, you know, the story of a kind of just, you know,

12:55.015 --> 13:04.625
Bruce Rogers was a famous man in American printing and what he's done.

13:04.645 --> 13:05.565
Who is now?

13:05.766 --> 13:06.607
Bruce Rogers.

13:06.627 --> 13:07.167
Bruce Rogers.

13:07.227 --> 13:08.508
Oh, that's right.

13:08.528 --> 13:18.819
And he did the most famous Bible of this century, the Oxford Bible.

13:20.961 --> 13:23.183
And it's considered a great book.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.372
And people have bought it, and the price has gone everywhere.

13:30.313 --> 13:40.143
And we saw it when some of it hadn't been bound, and we said, we'll wait.

13:42.225 --> 13:53.355
So then once Phil called us and said he had one that had been bound by a man that I...

13:53.707 --> 13:56.510
New York, a German who had come over.

13:56.570 --> 14:00.495
And he had gotten it.

14:00.515 --> 14:02.257
It's all in one volume.

14:03.759 --> 14:13.871
And I had the first chance at it, and he said, a price.

14:14.632 --> 14:17.315
If you won't quote the price, I'll tell you, okay?

14:18.256 --> 14:19.477
Five hundred dollars.

14:20.839 --> 14:23.342
And that was just a little more

14:24.031 --> 14:32.903
than the price was going then for the unbound.

14:35.767 --> 14:51.709
And now they're way up because the crown has taken all the ones that weren't done and keeping them and binds them for men who come to England like books if they want to give them a gift.

14:52.634 --> 14:54.976
Whether they've used them up now, I don't know.

14:56.158 --> 15:01.943
But he told me he had this, and he said, You've been waiting on the book.

15:01.963 --> 15:02.664
I'd buy it.

15:02.804 --> 15:03.225
I did.

15:03.245 --> 15:08.450
So things go on.

15:09.971 --> 15:20.802
But not only did the value go up, but I was walking down Fifth Avenue with another dealer who, after his death,

15:21.558 --> 15:23.480
I've liked very much.

15:24.841 --> 15:28.624
And he said, you know, you were talking about your Bible.

15:28.744 --> 15:45.378
I heard an interesting thing that Bruce Rogers was over there, and he saw them, and he saw a limitation in them.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.143
And he said, there aren't any.

15:51.545 --> 15:56.411
nobody's seen one except those books.

15:56.752 --> 16:01.518
And he said, I think you told me that yours had a limitation page.

16:01.578 --> 16:03.560
I said, that's the way I remember it.

16:06.644 --> 16:09.088
So, well, he said, look at it.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.110
I looked, and there it was.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.595
This is number 31.

16:15.436 --> 16:17.839
I'll show it to you if you want to see it.

16:17.859 --> 16:21.163
And, uh, uh,

16:21.903 --> 16:25.206
Then I was talking to Alan Fern.

16:25.226 --> 16:27.248
He was then at the Library of Congress.

16:28.430 --> 16:47.329
I said, Alan, do any of your Rogers Bibles have this in it?

16:48.330 --> 16:51.353
He said, no, but we've got a big one.

16:51.890 --> 17:03.124
that 30 people paid $1,000 apiece to have their name put on something in it.

17:03.144 --> 17:04.346
And that's the larger one.

17:04.366 --> 17:06.629
I said, sure, I know that one.

17:06.649 --> 17:09.693
That's the one that Rogers had planned to give to you.

17:10.454 --> 17:13.437
But as usual, he got hired up for money.

17:14.639 --> 17:20.226
And so when he had it done, he had that added.

17:20.847 --> 17:23.590
so that you've got it, and that's an uncut one.

17:23.650 --> 17:29.658
The other one is, there aren't any.

17:29.718 --> 17:31.720
I said, well, look again at yours.

17:31.740 --> 17:33.202
And he called back, they haven't.

17:33.222 --> 17:34.364
I said, well, I've got one.

17:35.205 --> 17:36.186
Mine's number 31.

17:36.206 --> 17:46.078
The reason I looked, because I never have cared about that.

17:46.936 --> 17:48.618
Phil had told me about it.

17:48.878 --> 17:51.361
No, this other man had told me about it.

17:51.882 --> 17:54.645
Well, I had looked and I thought I had got it.

17:55.506 --> 17:59.930
And there it is.

18:01.432 --> 18:06.758
I guess one other question and then I'll take my leave.

18:07.639 --> 18:10.122
Is it important to you that these books stay together?

18:10.162 --> 18:13.265
No.

18:14.006 --> 18:15.728
No, except for the...

18:16.754 --> 18:29.048
except for the Offitina-Badoni books, Marla Sykes books.

18:30.550 --> 18:40.602
And they'll go to all of them, that they've got some, and if they'll pick the better ones of them,

18:41.662 --> 18:42.403
To the Newbury.

18:42.663 --> 18:42.903
What?

18:43.324 --> 18:44.405
To the Newbury.

18:44.425 --> 18:45.646
They go to the Newbury.

18:45.766 --> 18:48.850
So now, what, are you going to allow them to come and make their choice?

18:48.870 --> 18:49.350
Oh, sure.

18:49.390 --> 18:50.452
Oh, sure.

18:50.472 --> 18:51.813
I mean, you've stipulated this.

18:52.814 --> 18:53.355
They know it.

18:53.795 --> 18:56.098
And the others know it.

18:57.099 --> 18:58.300
The family knows it.

18:59.201 --> 19:01.884
They don't know about any of the other stuff now.

19:02.725 --> 19:09.272
What we may do, well, we've got a book that's going on exhibit now.

19:11.345 --> 19:24.179
It's a book we bought at a sale in London.

19:24.199 --> 19:28.845
And Jim Wells over there, he was then the head of the Wing Collection.

19:30.366 --> 19:33.450
And I had a way of bidding on the same book.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.234
And...

19:38.311 --> 19:42.034
by having the same person bid for it.

19:43.796 --> 19:45.738
You know, how could we do that?

19:46.218 --> 19:51.563
It doesn't seem right when they want the book and I want the book.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.666
You both have your limits, I guess, and you tell them.

19:54.766 --> 20:02.774
Well, that's what it always was that we wrote down on a piece of paper what we'd be willing to pay.

20:03.715 --> 20:07.238
And it was always that he...

20:07.488 --> 20:08.689
want to pay less.

20:09.730 --> 20:26.928
Well, there came this time, and I hope that, I don't know, I think it's been forgotten, this is just a story, that after they came, he wanted mine more than his.

20:28.589 --> 20:34.035
Well, today, and today he'd want his.

20:35.281 --> 21:02.773
He'd want the hours for them, but the reason for that is a funny one, that I'd have got it, and there were seven done this way, remarkably done, a modern illumination by a woman in about 1904, between there and there.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.861
There were seven of those.

21:04.921 --> 21:08.324
Each was different, done differently by her.

21:10.246 --> 21:13.989
And he saw a Mags catalog.

21:14.029 --> 21:16.712
That's what bid for us.

21:17.412 --> 21:19.194
Oh, Mags was the one who bid for the two of you.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.096
Well, on the books.

21:21.776 --> 21:24.258
The lower one, if it came to the lower price.

21:24.278 --> 21:26.160
Was it Ryan Mags that did this one?

21:26.180 --> 21:26.981
Yes.

21:27.001 --> 21:28.882
But on this one, I think we had.

21:28.902 --> 21:31.285
And on one of them, he wanted a change.

21:31.305 --> 21:32.946
And I think this was the one.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.868
that he wanted to change, the book that I would have bought.

21:37.888 --> 21:38.910
He changed his bit.

21:39.050 --> 21:40.994
Yeah, but what do you think I saw?

21:41.014 --> 21:45.182
I think the book was about $400 or some dollars.

21:45.362 --> 21:54.139
And how much do you think it was sold for three years ago and probably would be more now by mags in their catalog?

21:54.159 --> 21:55.441
I wouldn't even have to guess.

21:55.461 --> 21:56.503
$20,000?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.082
125,000 pounds.

22:00.523 --> 22:02.285
You know it's not realistic.

22:02.685 --> 22:03.366
Pounds.

22:03.386 --> 22:04.607
And what was the book now?

22:04.627 --> 22:05.128
Can you tell me?

22:05.168 --> 22:05.969
Do you remember what it was?

22:06.249 --> 22:06.489
What?

22:06.689 --> 22:07.750
Do you remember what the book?

22:07.770 --> 22:10.633
Do you mean the little one, the one I made the box for?

22:10.654 --> 22:11.334
Yeah.

22:12.235 --> 22:13.316
Where it is?

22:13.336 --> 22:13.857
125,000 pounds.

22:13.877 --> 22:15.779
No, it isn't there, Mary Louise.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.122
That's down just there with them.

22:19.843 --> 22:21.285
It's the Ashantine book.

22:21.945 --> 22:22.926
Oh, that thing.

22:22.946 --> 22:23.487
What is it?

22:24.040 --> 22:24.821
Ashen Dean.

22:25.242 --> 22:25.883
Ashen Dean?

22:26.003 --> 22:26.524
Yes.

22:26.544 --> 22:31.272
Ashen Dean, the Songs of Solomon.

22:32.674 --> 22:34.657
And Ashen Dean is what, a binding?

22:34.677 --> 22:38.784
No, a printer, a hand-pressed printer like Martin Schott.

22:38.804 --> 22:42.730
They're having this show at the Art Institute at the library there.

22:42.751 --> 22:44.413
We sent three books.

22:45.034 --> 22:48.580
What is so extraordinary about that book?

22:48.847 --> 22:50.911
That somebody would pay 125,000 pounds for it, I wonder.

22:51.111 --> 22:53.575
It was printed on parchment.

22:53.876 --> 22:59.346
And she illuminated it like the before printing books were written.

23:00.047 --> 23:00.367
I see.

23:00.448 --> 23:02.872
And she had beautiful stuff on parchment.

23:02.892 --> 23:03.613
And how old is it?

23:04.495 --> 23:06.779
1904, the book.

23:06.799 --> 23:08.321
Ashen Dean.

23:08.422 --> 23:09.464
That's one word or two.

23:10.004 --> 23:10.405
One word.

23:10.565 --> 23:12.429
A-S-H-E-N-D-E-A-N.

23:12.850 --> 23:13.150
E.

23:13.973 --> 23:16.136
And that's the name of the art?

23:16.156 --> 23:16.777
The Press.

23:16.797 --> 23:17.238
The Press.

23:17.458 --> 23:17.999
The Press.

23:18.099 --> 23:18.700
No, no.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.242
This is the Songs of Solomon.

23:20.262 --> 23:22.285
I understand, but Ash and Dean is the name of it.

23:22.305 --> 23:22.906
Yeah, that's right.

23:22.926 --> 23:23.427
The Press.

23:23.888 --> 23:26.472
It's quite a well-known one.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.994
And it's Songs of Solomon.

23:28.655 --> 23:29.276
That's wonderful.

23:29.376 --> 23:30.057
And you have that?

23:30.097 --> 23:31.559
Or that's on loan, I guess, for an exhibit?

23:31.579 --> 23:31.880
It's on loan.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.021
That's on loan right now.

23:33.082 --> 23:34.584
We'd show it to you if we did.

23:34.604 --> 23:40.152
And so is that a book that you'll ultimately, you think, give to the Newbery?

23:40.332 --> 23:42.195
Well, we have many thoughts.

23:42.215 --> 23:43.457
We have agreed to, but the

23:44.163 --> 23:47.568
Yes, we agreed to do that.

23:47.588 --> 23:51.875
Some of, one or two of our grandchildren are slightly interested in books.

23:52.576 --> 23:56.662
Yeah.

23:56.682 --> 23:57.523
You mean to own them?

23:58.485 --> 23:59.146
To have them.

23:59.226 --> 23:59.967
To have them.

24:00.027 --> 24:00.768
Well, that's nice.

24:00.809 --> 24:01.730
Same thing.

24:01.810 --> 24:04.454
To have to own them.

24:04.474 --> 24:07.278
Well, you hope that maybe they don't sell them, though, you know?

24:07.519 --> 24:08.280
I don't think so.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.887
You know, like Bradley Martin's books were sold within months of his, you know, when he...

24:13.728 --> 24:16.571
I went to the sale in New York, the Bradley Martin's sale.

24:17.713 --> 24:20.396
What are you looking for?

24:21.016 --> 24:23.780
Nothing I'd ask for about a show.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.581
Here's the book.

24:25.081 --> 24:26.983
I'll look at this book and then I'll take my leave.

24:27.003 --> 24:30.047
What one is that?

24:30.067 --> 24:32.370
This is the Monet.

24:32.850 --> 24:36.174
He's got very popular Monet.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.116
Oh, that's quite wonderful.

24:38.136 --> 24:40.519
We bought a lot of them because we liked them.

24:40.679 --> 24:41.641
This is French, right?

24:41.801 --> 24:42.942
Yeah, this is French.

24:43.833 --> 24:44.954
It's a French book.

24:45.935 --> 24:50.601
And we bought a number of his because we liked it.

24:50.941 --> 24:52.563
Oh, I can smell it.

24:52.623 --> 24:55.666
You could get them pretty well like a song.

24:55.686 --> 25:00.692
And then there was a big... I'm just looking at the title.

25:02.194 --> 25:03.655
It's... Which one is that?

25:03.675 --> 25:04.997
14?

25:05.578 --> 25:12.085
That's T-R-A-I-N... That's 8, M-I...

25:13.043 --> 25:15.966
And it's bound by, and how do you spell this?

25:16.006 --> 25:16.647
B-O-N-E-T.

25:18.889 --> 25:20.971
He never bound a book himself.

25:21.552 --> 25:21.852
No.

25:21.912 --> 25:24.475
He designed them and had people bind them.

25:24.815 --> 25:28.439
No, he designed the binding.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.161
Oh, excuse me.

25:30.221 --> 25:36.267
Well, this one would probably work more because it's got all sorts of things in it.

25:36.628 --> 25:38.910
But it's really the binding, of course, which makes it.

25:39.230 --> 25:40.071
Yeah.

25:40.892 --> 25:42.814
Well, a few years ago,

25:43.317 --> 25:52.027
There was a big thing when a South American bought a whole one of this manuals.

25:52.047 --> 25:53.048
Is that the Argentine?

25:53.289 --> 25:54.050
Yeah.

25:54.070 --> 25:57.033
Priscilla Juvelas was the one who went down with Fleming and they bought it.

25:57.053 --> 25:57.854
Yeah, she was one of them.

25:58.294 --> 26:00.697
She's a bitch, in my opinion.

26:00.717 --> 26:01.018
Really?

26:01.038 --> 26:06.043
I don't like her and I don't think she knows much about books, but she got it with him.

26:07.365 --> 26:08.086
And they did it.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.670
Well, these books, this thing,

26:12.275 --> 26:18.845
sold for, I mean, the ones that Bonet did, those were the ones that brought the highest price.

26:20.807 --> 26:24.713
Now, I don't know what we, wait, yeah.

26:27.697 --> 26:32.965
Now, from the way they spent to pay it, you know how much we paid for this book when we bought it?

26:34.788 --> 26:38.053
We bought it in January 73.

26:38.113 --> 26:41.117
Now, we were paying lots of money, too.

26:41.637 --> 26:48.125
We paid $800 in the way they had it.

26:48.185 --> 26:53.611
They got for the book for South America.

26:54.712 --> 26:59.218
This one would probably have been one of their most valuable books.

26:59.238 --> 26:59.938
So what do you think?

27:00.599 --> 27:00.839
What?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.561
What do you think it would go for today?

27:03.182 --> 27:04.023
Oh, I don't know.

27:06.026 --> 27:08.168
I would say that it would begin

27:09.211 --> 27:20.583
No, if anybody's foolish enough to pay with the dead, they'd pay half a million dollars for it.

27:20.603 --> 27:22.645
For that book?

27:22.665 --> 27:22.765
Yeah.

27:22.865 --> 27:24.447
No, for the binding.

27:24.467 --> 27:25.328
For that binding?

27:25.528 --> 27:26.469
For that one binding?

27:26.889 --> 27:27.730
Sure.

27:27.770 --> 27:28.791
Half a million dollars?

27:28.891 --> 27:29.272
Yeah.

27:29.912 --> 27:32.675
I think that's what they paid for some of Bonnet's.

27:32.715 --> 27:33.736
This is an early one.

27:34.057 --> 27:35.398
And we had a lot of them.

27:35.418 --> 27:37.260
You know why we bought them?

27:38.050 --> 27:38.751
No, why?

27:38.911 --> 27:41.053
We didn't care about who the binder was.

27:41.153 --> 27:42.274
We liked the binding.

27:43.916 --> 27:49.301
But what has happened over the last 17 years to make these French bindings take off like this?

27:50.282 --> 27:51.163
Well, they were good.

27:51.183 --> 27:52.645
They were colorful.

27:53.125 --> 27:58.871
And they set it for all of Europe.

27:59.992 --> 28:01.013
They set a stamp.

28:01.033 --> 28:01.694
And he set it.

28:02.835 --> 28:08.040
See, he'd been a designer of ladies' clothing.

28:11.581 --> 28:12.382
That's wonderful.

28:13.243 --> 28:18.350
I mean, I've really tell you, now that book, this book isn't worth any more to us.

28:19.511 --> 28:26.741
And the funny thing is we have a little one that he did near death, the last one, a little bit of a one.

28:26.761 --> 28:33.109
He uses the same color combination as he did in this.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.172
I mean, this is just one.

28:35.693 --> 28:39.037
This is a little book like I've shown to the moon.

28:40.739 --> 28:41.200
But...

28:41.737 --> 28:42.298
What do you say?

28:42.718 --> 28:53.294
You know, everybody will tell you about the books they got, how valuable they can, but they don't tell you of the ones that are worthless.

28:54.676 --> 28:56.218
I think I'm going to quit on that one, sir.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.099
That's a good line.

28:58.461 --> 29:03.128
They'll tell you about how great the books are, but they won't tell you about the ones that are worthless.

29:06.513 --> 29:06.853
That's right.

29:06.873 --> 29:09.617
Mr. Rosenthal, you've been very, very generous with your time.

29:10.053 --> 29:16.542
What I was going to show you is terrible.

29:16.562 --> 29:21.289
And we had one, and we never bought another one.

29:21.309 --> 29:23.192
You've heard about the jewel bindings?

29:23.612 --> 29:23.853
No.

29:24.614 --> 29:26.757
Well, let me show you one.

29:26.777 --> 29:30.042
And now... A jewel binding?

29:30.262 --> 29:31.464
Yeah.

29:31.484 --> 29:34.508
That's the Lady of the Lake, I can see, by Sir Walter Scott.

29:36.614 --> 29:40.239
We're standing over by the window overlooking Lake Michigan.

29:40.259 --> 29:40.440
Here.

29:41.421 --> 29:42.082
Oh, God.

29:42.543 --> 29:43.024
See there?

29:44.245 --> 29:44.766
See this?

29:46.228 --> 29:47.270
What is this date from?

29:48.031 --> 29:48.272
What?

29:48.772 --> 29:49.513
This is old?

29:50.214 --> 29:53.820
No, this is fairly new, Sangorsky.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.925
Sounds good.

29:57.065 --> 29:58.347
That got for another one.

30:00.550 --> 30:03.635
People are spending lots of money for it.

30:03.715 --> 30:04.596
We just want it.

30:04.981 --> 30:16.256
one of these books we got it cheap and I... You've erased out the price there.

30:16.576 --> 30:20.802
No, that was the price of the book originally.

30:21.122 --> 30:22.003
What do you call this?

30:22.043 --> 30:22.844
What kind of a binding?

30:22.884 --> 30:24.106
A jewel binding.

30:24.527 --> 30:25.668
By anyone in particular?

30:26.249 --> 30:27.951
Well, this one was done by

30:28.387 --> 30:39.041
S-A-N-G-O-R-S-K-I-N-S-U-T-C-L-I-F-F-E of London.

30:39.061 --> 30:39.702
Yeah.

30:39.722 --> 30:41.163
And these actually have jewels in them.

30:41.564 --> 30:43.887
Yeah, there are jewels.

30:45.269 --> 30:48.533
Not here, but you see these are all inlays.

30:48.553 --> 30:58.005
These are different colored leather that they use.

30:59.065 --> 31:04.794
And, uh, but here you see that you see them here.

31:06.877 --> 31:09.060
Are these precious jewels or semi-precious jewels?

31:09.080 --> 31:09.240
No.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.345
Oh, I don't know what all of them are.

31:13.026 --> 31:15.049
Did you get that in this country or abroad?

31:15.590 --> 31:20.217
No, we bought this in this country.

31:20.237 --> 31:20.678
I think.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.621
How old would you say it is?

31:22.661 --> 31:23.763
Is it the 20th century?

31:23.923 --> 31:25.826
Oh, no, these are 20th century.

31:26.206 --> 31:26.727
The book.

31:27.348 --> 31:30.111
Well, it's Lady of the Lake by Sir Walter Scott.

31:30.251 --> 31:31.473
Yeah.

31:31.493 --> 31:35.698
The book is 1863.

31:35.718 --> 31:36.198
1863.

31:36.379 --> 31:41.364
Is that the first printing, or is that a... No, I don't know.

31:41.444 --> 31:42.666
I don't say here.

31:42.926 --> 31:48.232
No, I don't think that's... It may be involved.

31:48.252 --> 31:52.277
No, we had bought one of them.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.701
Let's see, when did we get this book?

31:56.187 --> 31:57.388
Well, I can't be sure.

31:58.489 --> 31:58.910
It's okay.

31:59.930 --> 32:05.376
But, uh, but I don't—I wouldn't buy another.

32:05.396 --> 32:06.356
You wouldn't buy another?

32:06.437 --> 32:06.577
No.

32:06.657 --> 32:07.437
But you have one.

32:07.518 --> 32:09.299
Even if I didn't have one.

32:09.639 --> 32:11.141
Yeah.

32:11.161 --> 32:12.242
Oh, that Roger thing?

32:12.362 --> 32:16.426
Yeah, how did—oh, there was a sale of a man, and you bought it.

32:16.446 --> 32:18.408
You picked this, didn't you?

32:18.428 --> 32:20.109
I'm not that one.

32:20.129 --> 32:20.690
I don't think.

32:22.171 --> 32:24.253
The ladies— That jewel thing?

32:24.487 --> 32:24.907
What?

32:24.927 --> 32:25.608
That jewel?

32:25.708 --> 32:26.369
Thank you.

32:26.569 --> 32:27.490
I never picked that.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.311
Okay.

32:29.892 --> 32:31.833
I'm going to take my leave now, Mrs. Rosenthal.

32:31.853 --> 32:34.355
It was a very interesting having you here.

32:34.375 --> 32:36.277
Thank you very much for your hospitality.

32:36.317 --> 32:36.697
I don't know.

32:36.717 --> 32:38.479
We didn't do very much for it.

32:38.499 --> 32:42.562
Well, you gave me your time, and that's the most precious thing anybody has, really.

32:47.146 --> 32:48.707
I don't know how you describe this collection.

32:49.128 --> 32:50.869
Myth much.

32:50.889 --> 32:52.651
Yeah, but it's got an identity, doesn't it?

32:53.632 --> 32:54.072
Where?

32:54.490 --> 32:58.674
Well, it's the Rosenfall collection.

32:58.714 --> 33:00.416
Do you see it as that?

33:00.436 --> 33:01.877
No, I don't really.

33:02.017 --> 33:05.601
Well, I don't know what this one is, but here's a modern French one.

33:05.621 --> 33:06.241
I love that.

33:06.301 --> 33:07.162
It's so nice.

33:07.182 --> 33:13.088
And after that junky thing up there with all the jewels, I think it's kind of... Yeah, this is nice from here.

33:13.108 --> 33:13.648
Look at that.

33:13.989 --> 33:14.909
This is so smooth.

33:14.929 --> 33:16.771
You know who's done the etchings in here?

33:16.791 --> 33:17.892
Oh, God, it's so smooth.

33:17.912 --> 33:18.993
It's like that.

33:19.274 --> 33:20.295
No Giacometti.

33:20.315 --> 33:21.536
Giacometti, I mean.

33:21.556 --> 33:21.876
Giacometti.

33:22.597 --> 33:22.877
Yeah.

33:24.224 --> 33:24.885
Yeah.

33:24.905 --> 33:26.186
Well, that's exquisite.

33:26.586 --> 33:28.008
And so on.

33:28.028 --> 33:28.668
Oops, I'm sorry.

33:29.909 --> 33:31.151
And who is the binder in this?

33:31.911 --> 33:33.473
Oh, that's a French one.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.154
These were, this French man.

33:35.174 --> 33:35.875
I think it's Rouet.

33:35.895 --> 33:38.918
Who was getting binders on the way.

33:39.639 --> 33:39.939
Rouet?

33:39.959 --> 33:42.201
No, who were, he thought were going to be good.

33:42.782 --> 33:45.524
He subsidized them.

33:45.564 --> 33:47.426
No, no, you're not looking in the right place.

33:48.587 --> 33:49.608
All right, you look for it.

33:50.249 --> 33:53.472
It's funny, I was looking for that one the other day and couldn't find it.

33:53.772 --> 33:54.633
I think it's beautiful.

33:54.953 --> 33:55.694
It is lovely.

33:55.714 --> 33:57.236
I think it's nicer than that.

33:58.598 --> 34:00.520
It's one of those French kids.

34:01.201 --> 34:10.252
I just took it by, I wasn't thinking of the artist or anything about the book.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.955
I think it's, what is it, Monique Martin.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.578
Monique Martin, M-A-R-T-E-N.

34:15.978 --> 34:18.141
Yeah, she may have done that.

34:18.161 --> 34:18.261
Yeah.

34:21.447 --> 34:24.250
It's a nice, I like the Giacometti.

34:24.790 --> 34:27.252
G-I-A-C-O-M-E-T-T-I, right?

34:27.432 --> 34:27.833
Yeah.

34:27.853 --> 34:28.593
Giacometti.

34:28.854 --> 34:30.535
You know those screeny things.

34:33.418 --> 34:35.159
Manic-mature.

34:35.179 --> 34:36.921
Manic-monic-mature.

34:36.941 --> 34:37.742
How do we spell that?

34:37.762 --> 34:38.703
What do you think?

34:38.723 --> 34:39.423
Matthew.

34:39.443 --> 34:40.064
Oh, Matthew.

34:40.104 --> 34:41.225
M-A-T-H-I-E-U?

34:41.405 --> 34:41.645
Yeah.

34:44.128 --> 34:45.849
Where's the cover for this, Sam?

34:46.310 --> 34:46.870
Right there.

34:46.890 --> 34:47.471
Is that it, no?

34:47.811 --> 34:48.051
No.

34:48.652 --> 34:49.853
No, it is.

34:49.873 --> 34:50.053
No.

34:54.185 --> 34:55.026
There you go.

34:55.046 --> 34:58.612
Thank you.

34:58.632 --> 35:02.057
Well, tomorrow I'm going down to the University of Chicago and then back to the Newberry.

35:02.678 --> 35:03.759
Oh, Newberry.

35:03.779 --> 35:05.462
You'll have a wonderful time.

35:05.482 --> 35:06.644
I was there most of today.

35:06.924 --> 35:08.006
Isn't that great?

35:08.386 --> 35:08.707
Yeah.

35:08.807 --> 35:09.808
Isn't that magnificent?

35:10.349 --> 35:12.813
Miro did this book.

35:12.833 --> 35:13.815
Miro.

35:13.835 --> 35:14.155
Miro.

35:14.816 --> 35:15.116
Yeah.

35:15.557 --> 35:16.278
M-I-R-O.

35:17.961 --> 35:20.084
Oh, you get all of them here.

35:20.104 --> 35:22.608
He signed it.

35:22.668 --> 35:22.808
Mm-hmm.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.642
Tara did and he did.

35:26.063 --> 35:27.185
Tara is the binder?

35:27.445 --> 35:28.967
No, he's the author.

35:31.309 --> 35:36.295
Mero did, well, let's see, who did the binder?

35:38.197 --> 35:38.318
LaRue.

35:38.918 --> 35:40.660
He was just a kid.

35:41.181 --> 35:44.425
It's curious, isn't it, how it used wood in there?

35:44.765 --> 35:45.646
Oh, that's wood inlaid?

35:45.766 --> 35:51.072
Yeah, mm-hmm.

35:51.112 --> 35:51.973
You name him.

35:51.993 --> 35:52.474
In the 70s,

35:52.910 --> 35:59.662
I'd leave Europe broke.

36:00.424 --> 36:05.213
Unfortunately, I didn't have to pay for a while.

36:05.233 --> 36:10.903
You didn't have to pay for a while.

36:10.943 --> 36:11.584
That's good.

36:11.604 --> 36:12.626
Oh, that's nice.

36:12.646 --> 36:13.468
Well, I've enjoyed this.

36:14.349 --> 36:15.812
Well, so it is.
