WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.789
Thank you.

00:08.150 --> 00:16.681
I also want to thank a lot of all the other people who were asking to come here.

00:17.182 --> 00:23.631
Because I plan an absolutely wonderful couple of days to speak to you all.

00:24.132 --> 00:28.097
I need to give you money all of you on every program, and it's quite wonderful.

00:28.077 --> 00:33.810
I'm going to leave the name smaller.

00:33.890 --> 00:40.003
For now, if anybody wants to ask me anything about money, I'm going to waste my time.

00:43.391 --> 00:47.520
But Joyce, oh, we were talking about...

00:48.007 --> 00:52.932
When somebody asked me a question, I think it was like, .

00:53.172 --> 01:04.223
When we were talking about people who were in my mental state, one or another, and I just said something, I checked off.

01:04.243 --> 01:09.268
I said, no, I mean, I always liked him, but he was sort of part of the household, you know?

01:09.288 --> 01:13.592
He talked like everybody at home.

01:14.062 --> 01:21.814
But I didn't think, when I thought later, I didn't feel good.

01:21.834 --> 01:33.673
Of course, people my age, when I went to school, at their work school, which I was only a little bit worried, I did think a lot about Jewish.

01:33.653 --> 01:55.678
The more I thought of the films later on, maybe about 15 years after I wrote a book or two, I realized that those stories in their form, somewhere or another, really were somehow in my head in a way that, you know, other words really seem to have very little,

01:55.658 --> 01:59.984
I mean, I didn't recognize what it was.

02:00.064 --> 02:06.552
But I think that's where the critics part of this organization comes in.

02:06.572 --> 02:10.658
They sort of tell you what, you know, who it comes to and so forth.

02:10.758 --> 02:14.002
And I'm literally glad if you stop.

02:14.022 --> 02:21.632
But I do think, again and again, well, I don't know if you are behind me, but mostly until I, you know,

02:22.321 --> 02:30.351
Mostly I was doing some poetry until the time I heard stories.

02:30.371 --> 02:47.313
I was going to have people's stories in the back, but it came back home.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.034
Was that poetry or story?

02:48.154 --> 02:48.815
Why?

02:48.835 --> 02:48.915
Why?

02:48.935 --> 02:49.717
Because we talked about this today.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.117
Why did I say that?

02:55.227 --> 03:12.785
What questions have you been answering to yourself?

03:12.805 --> 03:18.171
Maybe someone would do that.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.875
Who said that?

03:21.895 --> 03:23.577
No, I thought I should give you a chance, another little bit of a chance before.

03:23.597 --> 03:23.677
Yes?

03:23.697 --> 03:24.778
Would you write, would you chuckle, would you suppose?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.945
Not really, you know.

03:27.146 --> 03:37.259
I think sometimes when you read stuff aloud, I say, oh, that came out kind of funny.

03:37.279 --> 03:38.421
No, I don't really.

03:38.461 --> 03:42.787
I mean, I don't want to say thank you for myself.

03:42.807 --> 03:43.548
I read aloud.

03:43.768 --> 03:47.593
I mean, I work aloud, so I read aloud to myself a lot.

03:47.573 --> 04:10.780
Why did you pick the main place for the show?

04:11.266 --> 04:14.490
Well, it's really kind of a silly answer to that.

04:14.630 --> 04:21.817
It's just that I thought I was going to do a whole series called The Story Here and The Story Telling.

04:21.837 --> 04:34.011
I also had an idea that somewhere in the end of my first book, this woman, Faith, appeared, but she didn't have a name.

04:35.012 --> 04:37.054
And I thought, oh.

04:37.034 --> 04:43.923
I'm going to have these, I'm talking about trying to make jokes.

04:44.704 --> 04:50.050
See, when you try to make these jokes, it doesn't work, right?

04:50.150 --> 04:51.792
When you know you're writing them.

04:51.812 --> 04:53.575
So I made this joke.

04:53.595 --> 04:56.879
I was thinking I was going to have Faith, Hope and Charlie.

04:57.159 --> 05:04.308
And a lot of the way, I think it starts with the name Faith, which is very close to Grace, and people have invested with all their loans.

05:04.809 --> 05:06.771
It's great, which is

05:06.751 --> 05:08.275
The person who works for me.

05:15.994 --> 05:19.242
When you write, what kind of, can you hear?

05:19.407 --> 05:30.407
When you write, what kind of audience do you imagine if you do?

05:30.928 --> 05:32.111
I don't.

05:32.591 --> 05:38.603
I mean, you know, I read a lot, but it's very different.

05:38.763 --> 05:41.027
I don't think about it too much.

05:41.429 --> 05:47.159
Sometimes, sometimes I write something, you know, kind of to the borderline of someone.

05:47.340 --> 05:52.689
I have a story called a friend who just really, I don't know if I had a friend of mine who could die.

05:52.709 --> 06:05.192
And I don't really imagine the audience, but I do hope that, I hope for, I hope for the five people that are here that are here, except for the campus audience.

06:06.421 --> 06:09.565
Two questions.

06:09.585 --> 06:17.956
Do you rewrite a lot or do you revise and so on?

06:17.976 --> 06:18.176
Yes.

06:18.196 --> 06:23.222
And then do you type while you're in the computer or what?

06:23.242 --> 06:23.382
I type.

06:23.663 --> 06:25.064
I write my hand and I type.

06:25.465 --> 06:31.272
But I do go over a lot, a lot, a lot.

06:31.573 --> 06:33.475
I've just finished a...

06:33.623 --> 06:45.263
a preface or a production of something to the journals of Asikov's wife of his last seven years.

06:46.325 --> 06:52.476
And then included in it is a book

06:52.810 --> 07:00.162
It's actually not in the journals, although it's discussed somewhere in the journals, and I discuss it also.

07:00.242 --> 07:11.359
But in an old book, like Faustan is being called, or a story like Uncle the Witch, he had a long conversation about Zimbabwe.

07:11.339 --> 07:30.042
When you ask me that question, I feel like I haven't done the job yet, because he describes, he hands Puskassi a batch of magazines like this, and Puskassi says to him, oh, at least you're getting to work.

07:30.062 --> 07:34.427
And he says, no, this is only, this is the story of Bilbo the Cossack.

07:35.368 --> 07:40.114
It's just one story, and he describes rewriting it.

07:40.921 --> 07:41.763
many times.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.712
And he also wrote so much about rewriting and just how he does it.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.058
It's very humanistic because I do a lot of it myself.

07:48.078 --> 07:58.542
I really do a lot of work that I work finally, you know, after I made sure that I've done a lot of art and stuff.

07:58.522 --> 08:03.708
But he goes through all this describing finitely how he works.

08:04.148 --> 08:15.321
And then in the last part he says, he says, he says, but the one thing, you must make sure not to rule the story by overworking.

08:15.341 --> 08:21.007
So you're going to have to be careful with that kind of thing.

08:21.027 --> 08:22.249
But I don't believe you can.

08:22.489 --> 08:23.570
I really don't believe that.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.913
People like to say that it becomes interesting.

08:26.787 --> 08:29.852
I think he boiled it down all the time.

08:30.232 --> 08:32.576
He boiled it down for a very short break.

08:32.596 --> 08:33.597
Is that the same as you?

08:33.918 --> 08:35.981
Oh no, a lot of times I aired things.

08:36.101 --> 08:39.506
I mean, I think he probably aired things.

08:39.626 --> 08:42.511
And he changed them so much.

08:42.531 --> 08:50.803
I mean, he changed them so much, he sort of showed them this manuscript that it was, you know, probably both.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.523
That happens a lot right.

08:55.883 --> 09:06.192
It's everybody's first master.

09:06.212 --> 09:06.712
I hope.

09:06.772 --> 09:17.902
What do you think of the fact that your stories are anthologized and taught to freshmen in introductory fiction classes and analyzed in 50 minutes?

09:18.662 --> 09:20.264
Does that give you the willies?

09:20.824 --> 09:22.005
Does it feel good?

09:23.183 --> 09:25.385
I mean, I did that last semester.

09:28.508 --> 09:30.771
Well, I feel like that.

09:30.791 --> 09:39.539
I mean, I don't feel good about being taken apart too much because I was very bad at that as a student.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.544
I was hopeless as a critical writer or anything like that.

09:44.804 --> 09:50.490
I could normally tell you what a story was about, unless it had a very clear plot line.

09:50.470 --> 10:00.167
So I feel like that, but I feel good that people are reading their expressions.

10:00.207 --> 10:01.550
They like them.

10:01.570 --> 10:03.273
The students like them.

10:05.056 --> 10:07.701
That's really nice.

10:08.663 --> 10:11.668
But on the other hand,

10:11.648 --> 10:17.745
Yet people don't always understand what you said, you know.

10:18.307 --> 10:18.969
So you go there.

10:18.989 --> 10:19.611
Like that.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.338
And don't know what to do.

10:22.479 --> 10:23.602
It doesn't mean to do that.

10:23.803 --> 10:24.645
You write the story.

10:25.570 --> 10:28.214
What?

10:28.234 --> 10:31.900
Do you have a favorite one or two of your own stories?

10:31.920 --> 10:32.201
No.

10:32.802 --> 10:44.541
I mean, you know, I like probably the ones that somebody has said to me, you know, avoiding stories, I'm in most trouble with that one.

10:44.521 --> 11:00.206
Do you know if I have a sense of necessity?

11:00.407 --> 11:06.917
I mean, that is, writing has been a matter of choice for you?

11:08.551 --> 11:10.333
Do you mean for money, like living?

11:10.393 --> 11:21.384
No, no, I'm, well, I've never been a person, of course, so it's something you must do.

11:21.404 --> 11:25.629
Well, aren't they the same thing?

11:26.810 --> 11:31.555
No, I write stories that I have to write, pretty much.

11:31.575 --> 11:34.498
I really don't write a story unless I really have to write it.

11:34.518 --> 11:36.280
I might write something else.

11:36.260 --> 11:42.854
My brother's home, though I have to run.

11:43.034 --> 11:56.783
But I don't, I tend to, I have a lot of papers around and a lot of writing on it, so, but I don't go on with it and tell the story in America and then I have to write it.

11:57.657 --> 12:00.360
And there's a lot of pressure involved.

12:00.740 --> 12:04.364
I'm sure everybody is doing the same thing.

12:04.464 --> 12:06.226
Except, you know, when you do stuff on assignments.

12:06.406 --> 12:11.932
I'm always saying this in classes where the kids have to pack the gifts up on assignments.

12:12.012 --> 12:15.395
I say, well, you know, I've got a lot of pressure to write that story.

12:15.415 --> 12:20.461
And then they say, yeah, the teacher said they'll have to have it in that grade.

12:20.481 --> 12:26.567
It's a different pressure.

12:26.727 --> 12:26.787
Oh.

12:27.830 --> 12:37.620
I mean, if I'm in a minute or something, I can go along, but mostly I don't.

12:37.640 --> 12:45.447
I mean, unless I'm really in the middle of the story, even a very short one.

12:45.467 --> 12:46.008
How many hours?

12:46.708 --> 12:48.190
I don't count.

12:48.290 --> 12:53.415
How many is a matter of breakfast or lunch or eat?

12:53.935 --> 13:07.624
but i i i there are people who really work all day long and they you know

13:08.752 --> 13:32.344
Well, I mean, in a bit of a little story, I've worked a lot of the day, and working on this last piece that I worked on, I worked most of the day, but I can't say, I have to say in between times, I really am not like that.

13:32.364 --> 13:33.105
Yeah.

13:33.676 --> 13:45.128
Usually at this conference, when the word political comes up, it's a bad alternative to literature.

13:45.148 --> 13:49.373
There are often spoken on this, but we're here to talk mainly about literature.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.796
Your work would be a challenge to that.

13:52.836 --> 14:00.645
When people are reading and regarding literature, thinking about it, what about the political when it comes to evaluating what is good, is it not the good?

14:00.665 --> 14:02.907
Do you think it's easy to put the political aside or is that a mistake?

14:03.308 --> 14:11.098
Well, I'm a political person naturally, and it would be very unnatural to me if I am politically.

14:11.199 --> 14:13.121
I have a lot of feelings for literature, too.

14:13.361 --> 14:16.786
I mean, really, really a neat feeling.

14:17.567 --> 14:22.093
But at the same time, I've been a political person really from childhood.

14:22.073 --> 14:25.438
It's very natural for me to have strong political feelings.

14:27.100 --> 14:41.199
I've definitely known people like that, so if that's in both these stories in a way, although you can't say the political environment, in a way, something to program, the people are a little bit.

14:41.219 --> 14:44.563
They're thinking about these things.

14:45.164 --> 14:49.650
It's a funny question because it's an American question, isn't it?

14:49.630 --> 15:00.683
I mean, you wouldn't have anybody in South America say, oh no, we can do it, we can live with our literature.

15:01.384 --> 15:02.606
That would be a joke.

15:02.626 --> 15:07.391
If possible, or in Europe, in general, in most places.

15:08.052 --> 15:16.262
I consider that everything is pretty political, no matter what position you have and where you are.

15:16.597 --> 15:36.678
So that, I mean, I, I, I, um, I mean, I haven't talked about everything about this, um, about this context of these two days here, but, um, I have, I didn't wonder about, uh, about me in it to be full of science.

15:36.819 --> 15:42.925
I am, I'm dead below, you know, I'm not very literary or critical than, uh,

15:42.905 --> 15:44.468
So I am very political.

15:45.069 --> 15:50.459
And I think that nothing happens without a political movement.

15:50.980 --> 15:54.747
I mean, since you guys have a question or answer, this is not a question I would get.

15:55.629 --> 16:01.420
I mean, nothing happens without a political movement, and that's what's really interesting to me.

16:01.788 --> 16:07.587
I think that we're a very interesting time, actually.

16:08.049 --> 16:10.918
I don't think it's so terrible.

16:11.420 --> 16:14.430
I think as a citizen of the United States,

16:15.018 --> 16:26.492
It's very interesting that so many different voices are heard that never were heard or hardly ever heard.

16:27.152 --> 16:32.038
But none of those voices would exist without political movements behind them.

16:32.319 --> 16:33.600
I'll give you an example.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.963
I, as a feminist,

16:35.943 --> 16:39.427
Who's going to say it?

16:39.568 --> 16:40.449
Well, that's right.

16:40.469 --> 16:42.331
It's a lot of guys who say it.

16:42.351 --> 16:43.913
I miss them all.

16:43.953 --> 16:50.201
But I was very pleased to see the young women on each panel.

16:51.042 --> 17:00.094
And I haven't had, in my own time, ten years ago, a great struggle with my own organization, Ken,

17:00.074 --> 17:07.804
where they had panels, where they had a poetry reading with ten men and one women.

17:08.645 --> 17:20.040
I know that if this conference was taking place many years ago, you might rather have been so joyful, even when women might have been so joyful.

17:20.358 --> 17:30.374
And I think that it's a political movement that has made that happen everywhere and here.

17:30.735 --> 17:32.578
And here because people aren't thoughtful.

17:33.299 --> 17:40.792
I mean that's the reason it's happened not because it's political movement but because people are extraordinarily, whether they admit it or not.

17:41.974 --> 17:47.142
And I feel that if

17:47.543 --> 17:58.901
that if there's black literature, it's because there's a black movement there to serve it and to be served by it.

17:59.021 --> 18:08.857
So that's my general feeling about the importance of the fact that all Americans now are being heard from.

18:09.377 --> 18:11.020
Are they all great writers?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.683
No, you know, so what?

18:14.043 --> 18:21.711
I mean, you have to, you have to, you know, you have to be a little girl before you get into a big one.

18:22.032 --> 18:28.338
And there are wonderful Native American writers, like Leslie Martin, who still goes next to this.

18:28.358 --> 18:28.999
Wonderful person.

18:29.019 --> 18:36.687
So she wouldn't exist without the pressure of a developing Native American little girl.

18:37.139 --> 18:52.684
Which contemporary writers do you particularly admire?

18:53.103 --> 19:01.042
Well, I read a lot, and in a way that's bad, because I enjoy reading so much.

19:01.062 --> 19:07.517
There's a very funny book called, that Mencham's voice just wrote, it's called Rune by Reading.

19:07.750 --> 19:14.680
It's really about someone who reads someone that you should get to the end of what she's reading.

19:14.861 --> 19:21.310
You get to these arguments with her daughter about Monique Dick and her academic memory.

19:21.330 --> 19:27.379
It's a work that's very kind of good.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.812
Who are you talking about?

19:33.852 --> 19:35.675
Who are you talking about?

19:35.695 --> 19:49.356
I like a couple of people that you don't know about, I mean, because I like people.

19:49.797 --> 19:54.244
I mean, I like 20 months, and I like to remember everything I'm talking about.

19:54.427 --> 20:07.939
Um, I like, um, um, you were talking about before, this is by Cal Phillips, he's over there, you know, over there in Amherst.

20:07.959 --> 20:10.866
Yeah, that I, that was a cool book I liked very much.

20:10.846 --> 20:17.759
I liked a woman named Carolyn Schwiller, who you may not know very well.

20:17.779 --> 20:19.242
She had a book come out.

20:20.204 --> 20:24.271
Not a woman, though, but what I really liked was the first people.

20:24.612 --> 20:34.390
It's very smart and very, very intelligent and very funny and inventive.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.923
But she just didn't catch.

20:37.943 --> 20:42.990
I mean, for lots of funny reasons, like we were talking about this at the table.

20:43.010 --> 20:52.182
She missed a couple of prizes by, you know, by, I should say, by a bearded breath or so.

20:52.483 --> 20:56.708
And had she won them, she said something would impact.

20:56.728 --> 21:01.575
So a lot of people need help in those respects.

21:05.943 --> 21:07.687
Well, I think lots of people.

21:08.268 --> 21:23.580
There's a wonderful story, there's a book that cannot be difficult, I just want to talk to you about it, and it's called God Snake by Dean Stanley, and that's a great book.

21:25.619 --> 21:41.641
And then there are people that people like in general and a lot of people I don't like to say that a lot too.

21:41.661 --> 21:44.586
I think there's an interesting word.

21:44.606 --> 21:49.292
You know, when you talk about grave, not grave, then I have no idea what anyone's talking about.

21:49.312 --> 21:49.773
I don't understand.

21:50.013 --> 21:52.116
I mean, how do they talk about it when, you know, like,

21:52.096 --> 21:56.883
I thought, you know, nobody stopped writing.

21:57.043 --> 22:00.829
We couldn't let everybody say it was so funny, you know?

22:00.849 --> 22:02.331
Or hardy, you know?

22:02.351 --> 22:13.608
I mean, poor Philly, it's driven to the poetry, which, thank God, someone that had one of his great poems today, it was a great experience, hearing the poems.

22:13.628 --> 22:16.011
Listen, thank you all for having me.

22:42.755 --> 22:47.500
Thank you.
