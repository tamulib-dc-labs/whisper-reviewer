WEBVTT

00:04.064 --> 00:04.685
Bear with me.

00:05.225 --> 00:06.607
Did you catch all that that we were doing?

00:06.767 --> 00:07.648
Yeah.

00:07.668 --> 00:09.310
I have covered eight books of The Unvanquished.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.832
We have had eight Unvanquished.

00:10.872 --> 00:12.034
Let's go for just three more.

00:12.134 --> 00:13.656
Are you on?

00:13.836 --> 00:24.289
I want to go three more Unvanquished, and then we will run out the Brodsky collection of first and second printings of the hardback of The Unvanquished from 1938.

00:24.349 --> 00:28.494
Here's copy nine on its free front end paper and pencil.

00:28.594 --> 00:30.136
Malcolm Cowley, August 1945.

00:32.158 --> 00:32.539
All right.

00:33.220 --> 00:33.480
Now.

00:33.865 --> 00:43.910
What makes this book a little more scintillating than that is this one says on its title page in black ink for Malcolm Cowley, William Faulkner, Sherman, Connecticut, 25 October 1948.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.715
Is this a first?

00:46.268 --> 00:47.449
This is a first edition.

00:47.950 --> 00:48.871
Second printing, sorry.

00:48.891 --> 00:50.153
First edition, second printing.

00:50.193 --> 00:53.777
The dates sound like it might be after the... Well, but he didn't meet Cowley until 48.

00:54.218 --> 00:56.360
Well, that's because he was doing the portable Flockner.

00:56.721 --> 01:00.245
He did it in 45, but he never really met... Cowley was bringing him back.

01:00.385 --> 01:02.708
Cowley was, and that's why this is so significant.

01:02.748 --> 01:05.992
Really, that's why... But these... I've got one to show you yet.

01:06.113 --> 01:07.314
It's more significant than that.

01:07.795 --> 01:15.364
And if, in fact, Cowley never met him until he met him in New York in 48 and took him home for the weekend to his home in Sherman, Connecticut, where he'd meet his wife...

01:16.019 --> 01:17.081
Malcolm's Life, Muriel.

01:17.543 --> 01:19.066
What's the date that it said?

01:19.086 --> 01:19.266
48.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.291
25 October, 1948, OCT.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.619
But this book is wonderful.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.162
It's absolutely wonderful.

01:27.967 --> 01:28.949
It's a great artifact.

01:30.232 --> 01:31.655
How much would this bring in the book market?

01:31.675 --> 01:32.357
25?

01:32.377 --> 01:32.437
30?

01:32.998 --> 01:34.281
Maybe?

01:34.767 --> 01:35.288
Who knows?

01:35.348 --> 01:37.490
Who gives to you?

01:37.550 --> 01:39.873
Didn't Malcolm Cowley do a Faulkner file?

01:39.893 --> 01:40.474
Yeah, he did.

01:40.494 --> 01:42.176
He published his correspondence.

01:42.417 --> 01:46.001
I have a great correspondence from Malcolm Cowley between himself and me.

01:46.281 --> 01:46.902
I cherish it.

01:47.303 --> 01:49.986
Malcolm Cowley edited Mississippi Vistas.

01:50.086 --> 01:52.649
I have that edited copy that I cherish.

01:52.729 --> 01:53.611
Somewhere I've got it.

01:53.631 --> 01:54.191
I don't know where.

01:54.972 --> 01:58.336
Okay, that's copy nine in the non-duplicates.

01:58.356 --> 01:59.398
Here's copy ten.

02:00.599 --> 02:01.180
This one...

02:02.088 --> 02:05.351
Is called... This is called what?

02:05.432 --> 02:07.854
An advanced review copy.

02:07.934 --> 02:11.198
And it's got its price laid in with all its description.

02:12.379 --> 02:15.462
And it's got a promo photo laid in that was contemporary.

02:16.163 --> 02:19.847
And that makes this a very nice book because it's not only an inscription.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.148
Do you know which critic it went to?

02:21.389 --> 02:22.770
I don't know which one this went to.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.272
Can I just see the review slip?

02:24.953 --> 02:25.653
Yeah, sure.

02:25.673 --> 02:27.335
This will go to the next page.

02:27.355 --> 02:31.960
I don't know, but in some of the... We do have review copies that we do know to whom it went.

02:33.003 --> 02:34.705
But that gives you your publication date.

02:34.725 --> 02:38.390
Straight reading from Faulkner, and one of the finest books he has yet written.

02:39.050 --> 02:48.141
It covers the latter days of the Civil War, when the Yankees destroyed the plantation without the spirit of the indomitable Sartorist family in Mississippi.

02:48.942 --> 03:01.778
Many of the chapters appeared originally in magazines, but Faulkner has largely rewritten them, and this record of the Vagin Sartorists' is now a continued narrative packed with war, the romance human bubble coach, with illustrations by Edward

03:01.994 --> 03:27.529
shunton s-h-e-n-t-o-n and they did a limited signed now you have to realize that faulkner's reputation was waning in terms of sales at this point though critically it was real high so they only published 250 of the sign limited of that and i had the sign limited and i'll show you that too right that's i know what that's all about but this is oh i'm sorry excuse me this is a very pretty very handsome sign limited but limited only 250 copies because no one was buying faulkner

03:28.319 --> 03:30.201
And that would be what a collector would have.

03:30.701 --> 03:34.385
Now, a collector, a normal collector, Carter Burden, most likely would have this.

03:35.146 --> 03:39.290
Carter might have a signed one, maybe, but no one else will.

03:39.971 --> 03:42.594
Peterson may have had one inscribed, unvanquished.

03:42.974 --> 03:44.435
What do we do, a dozen of these, by the way?

03:44.596 --> 03:47.819
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve.

03:47.839 --> 03:49.400
No, ten, you've done eleven.

03:49.701 --> 03:50.482
Here comes twelve.

03:50.542 --> 03:51.463
That one's different.

03:51.483 --> 03:52.644
Let's call those the trade.

03:53.385 --> 03:57.769
These are all the trade, and you might say, understandably, they're all the same.

03:58.458 --> 03:59.880
Well, I've given you 11 distinctions.

03:59.900 --> 04:00.861
Let me give you the 12th one.

04:02.123 --> 04:12.098
This one is inscribed on the free front end paper in brown ink to Phil Stone from William Faulkner, Oxford Miss, 20 Janney, 1938.

04:12.138 --> 04:13.680
Well, isn't that interesting?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.282
Didn't we see another book, 20 Janney?

04:16.905 --> 04:19.268
How about the Tootsie Brown copy?

04:27.685 --> 04:31.431
See, one of the things Bob and I are going to do is get all these inscribed books isolated, too.

04:31.451 --> 04:32.572
We really don't have any help.

04:33.353 --> 04:34.335
Don't move for a second.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.917
The machine is running.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.963
All right, I'm trying to find the Tootsie Brown copy that I gave him.

04:40.003 --> 04:41.365
It's pretty far as close.

04:41.385 --> 04:41.886
It's down.

04:42.987 --> 04:44.029
Here may be the Tootsie.

04:44.790 --> 04:50.739
Now, that says 1938 from Cho-Cho to Tootsie, but here, look at what this says.

04:51.400 --> 04:51.861
I'm listening.

04:52.001 --> 04:52.501
Just talk to me.

04:52.521 --> 04:54.925
This says, interestingly enough, the copy that he gave...

04:55.276 --> 04:56.017
Want to hold that one?

04:56.197 --> 04:59.881
The copy that he gave to Tutsi, it'll be nice to get a picture together.

04:59.901 --> 05:02.364
December, I think this is... Okay, read that one.

05:02.604 --> 05:03.705
Oh, what do I got here, January?

05:03.746 --> 05:04.086
Janney.

05:04.586 --> 05:05.327
Yeah, yeah.

05:05.868 --> 05:07.890
I think this is... That's 20 Janney.

05:08.371 --> 05:09.672
You're right, that's a month before.

05:09.692 --> 05:10.313
20 December.

05:10.413 --> 05:11.855
Yeah, huh.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.677
Well, that's a year before, almost.

05:13.697 --> 05:15.158
That's January of 38th.

05:15.178 --> 05:15.799
Oh, you're right.

05:15.959 --> 05:16.760
You're absolutely right.

05:16.780 --> 05:20.504
But this is when Tutsi came to visit at Roanoke.

05:20.524 --> 05:22.026
She came to visit Victoria.

05:22.377 --> 05:26.081
So I met Tutsi just by accident, really, here in St.

05:26.101 --> 05:26.401
Louis.

05:28.603 --> 05:29.924
Victoria had told me she was here.

05:30.205 --> 05:30.805
Remember I met her?

05:30.945 --> 05:31.426
I said here.

05:31.466 --> 05:32.126
I'm not in St.

05:32.146 --> 05:32.767
Louis.

05:33.768 --> 05:34.349
But look at this.

05:34.389 --> 05:36.250
I mean, where are you going to find inscriptions like this?

05:38.453 --> 05:41.816
These books are just, they're one-of-a-kind artifacts.

05:41.836 --> 05:43.518
And I went to find them all.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.921
Don't pay any attention to me.

05:46.941 --> 05:47.541
Just talk.

05:47.561 --> 05:47.722
Okay.

05:47.922 --> 05:49.303
I'm going to show you some more highlights soon.

05:49.323 --> 05:50.224
I'm going to put these away.

05:51.875 --> 06:00.008
But now, Nick, there are 12 copies there, and all 12 of those copies are different.

06:00.028 --> 06:02.051
Some are associations, some are inscribed.

06:04.174 --> 06:04.475
I'm here.

06:04.715 --> 06:08.581
Will you give me those, and I'll put them back, and I'll show them some more.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.632
You just said you could do a run like that on every single title.

06:15.792 --> 06:20.059
On every title, I could show you 12, 15, 20 books that all look like they're the same.

06:20.512 --> 06:26.660
that all are associations or presentations or inscription copies that make each one distinct.

06:26.680 --> 06:35.431
So while condition, say, on these three hamlets that I'm just pointing at would be nice, it's quite irrelevant to the importance of the book.

06:35.451 --> 06:36.712
That's another good question.

06:36.772 --> 06:43.060
Most collectors would pass on items like the ones I showed you because they didn't have their dust jackets because they were in shabby shape.

06:43.293 --> 06:46.216
What a terrible mistake to pass on a book of John Chiardi's.

06:46.636 --> 06:50.600
We can't blame John if he decided to... Well, if he read it.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.123
If he read it, and then put some coffee down beside it, I mean, who gives a damn?

06:54.143 --> 06:56.646
But indeed, condition is important.

06:56.666 --> 07:04.513
Each book in this collection has a representative copy of a first, or of a significant book that is in scillating shape.

07:04.533 --> 07:12.000
I have those too, but I never... One of the things I had to learn as a collector early on, no, not early on, later on,

07:12.487 --> 07:17.034
Once I got into the world-class material, you don't argue with what's in front of you.

07:17.495 --> 07:19.518
If a dog bit the spine, you take it.

07:19.719 --> 07:26.029
I have one that the dog bit the spine that's an inscribed presentation copy from Faulkner to his stepson Malcolm.

07:26.409 --> 07:31.498
Was I going to refuse to buy the copy from Malcolm because he said here it's a little bad?

07:31.598 --> 07:33.060
Let me show you a better example of that.

07:33.428 --> 07:36.511
Malcolm Cowley wrote me the most touching letter when I wrote him once.

07:36.892 --> 07:38.353
I'd seen him have been with him.

07:38.814 --> 07:40.215
He said, you're going to be disappointed.

07:40.235 --> 07:42.658
He said, yes, I do have some Faulkner books left.

07:43.179 --> 07:45.221
And he said, I have one that I know you're not going to want.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.965
It's a copy that I've gone around to the various universities and used.

07:49.025 --> 07:50.066
It's my teaching copy.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.769
He said, it's real shabby and all messed up.

07:52.789 --> 07:53.950
This is Malcolm Cowley.

07:53.970 --> 07:57.514
Malcolm Cowley wrote me and said, you're not going to want this, but if you do, I'll send it to you.

07:58.515 --> 08:02.760
He said, it's got Scotch tape on the dust jacket and everything else and I've carried it around with me.

08:03.230 --> 08:05.393
But I'll send it to you if you want it, and you can have it for $500.

08:05.453 --> 08:08.377
He wasn't being that naive then, was he?

08:08.477 --> 08:11.060
No, he wasn't.

08:11.080 --> 08:20.612
But the copy he sent to me is the portable Faulkner on the title page inscribed from Malcolm Cowley, William Faulkner, Sherman, Connecticut, 25 October 1948.

08:20.652 --> 08:22.655
I wonder why he carried that one around.

08:23.516 --> 08:24.738
Well, it's a very interesting thing.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.081
That's the kind you would almost keep as an artifact.

08:27.121 --> 08:28.122
Why would he carry that from Connecticut?

08:28.142 --> 08:32.848
Well, there is an interesting answer to that, and I'm going to tell you a story about that that just came to my mind.

08:33.419 --> 08:36.944
When I bought my first marble fawn, I told you about that.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.188
I had an opportunity.

08:39.248 --> 08:40.029
I take that back.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.351
It was in one of the Goodwin sales.

08:42.112 --> 08:44.696
It was in the Goodwin sale that came up in 78, 980.

08:45.016 --> 08:47.700
I can't remember now, 77 or 8.

08:48.541 --> 08:53.549
I bought a number of inscribed books that were Malcolm Cowley's books out of that Jonathan Goodwin sale.

08:53.689 --> 08:57.655
But one classic book that was offered was a copy of the Portable Faulkner.

08:58.023 --> 09:03.731
From 1946, contemporaneous with the publication Faulkner's inscription to Malcolm.

09:04.632 --> 09:06.514
And I said, oh, I want that book so much.

09:06.654 --> 09:08.377
And I took out a bigger loan at that time.

09:08.457 --> 09:13.323
At that point, I'd already gotten real gutsy because I'd already become a world-class Faulkner collector.

09:13.343 --> 09:16.948
Bought a bunch of books inscribed to Cowley and a bunch of other nice things.

09:17.449 --> 09:23.136
But I didn't have the guts to go for that one book that brought about eight or $9,000 in that sale.

09:24.432 --> 09:27.577
That was the 1946 copy, and I lamented terribly.

09:27.657 --> 09:32.926
I thought, oh, the one book I really want, sure, the one book I really want, I will never see.

09:32.946 --> 09:34.208
I will never see.

09:34.268 --> 09:37.213
So I became friendly with Malcolm.

09:37.293 --> 09:38.375
He and I corresponded.

09:38.435 --> 09:38.836
I met him.

09:38.876 --> 09:39.477
I was with him.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.059
We were good friends.

09:41.199 --> 09:42.682
He edited one of my poetry books.

09:43.223 --> 09:45.867
And then I had that classic letter in our correspondence.

09:46.893 --> 09:48.996
in which he wrote me, and he sent me two books.

09:49.036 --> 09:50.839
He said, I've actually got two books left.

09:51.199 --> 10:00.854
He was so impressed, Nick, that I had bought all the books out of the Goodwin sale because he said, oh, my God, I remember when I sold those to Henry Wenning in New Haven because I had no money.

10:01.895 --> 10:05.540
Well, now, Henry Wenning was the same man who taught me how to collect books.

10:06.582 --> 10:09.987
Okay, so years later, I buy the Cowley books now.

10:10.247 --> 10:11.890
For instance, may I just interrupt?

10:11.910 --> 10:12.090
Go ahead.

10:12.340 --> 10:19.348
It has his annotations in here, of course, and here he's written, end of sentence, better than 8,000 words.

10:19.609 --> 10:21.311
All right.

10:21.811 --> 10:25.977
He would have probably used that book since 1946 over the time Fawker signed it.

10:26.037 --> 10:33.406
He may not have continued to use it that much after Fawker signed it, but a lot of that wear and tear on the book may have been from 1946 to 1948.

10:33.626 --> 10:36.289
He told me in that letter that he carried this one around with it.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.350
Well, it looks for sure.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.211
Well, let me tell you what.

10:38.391 --> 10:39.893
He didn't carry the other one around with him.

10:39.913 --> 10:40.394
He sold it.

10:40.574 --> 10:50.005
Point is, that sold for about 8,000 bucks, and I lamented in that sale, oh, gosh, the one book that would have really made this Faulkner collection a capstone, or that would have been a capstone in it.

10:50.665 --> 10:55.131
And so I had to live with that little lament, and as an obsessive collector, it would have stayed in my craw.

10:56.232 --> 11:01.618
I met Malcolm, and in 1981 or two, in a letter that he wrote back to me, he said, OLD,

11:01.818 --> 11:02.559
Oh, Lewis.

11:02.599 --> 11:03.219
He called me Lewis.

11:03.380 --> 11:03.960
Oh, Lewis.

11:04.561 --> 11:08.765
By the way, I just remembered, I do have two Faulkner books still in my library.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.466
And furthermore, he sent me his whole shelf.

11:10.947 --> 11:13.549
Two shelves of Faulkner of his own annotated copies.

11:13.950 --> 11:15.852
His review copies and his annotated copies.

11:15.932 --> 11:17.113
I acquired all his books.

11:17.834 --> 11:22.478
Malcolm Cowley certainly understood the importance of books as artifacts.

11:23.019 --> 11:25.181
Well, he also was a pragmatic Yankee.

11:25.201 --> 11:25.701
Was he selling?

11:25.921 --> 11:27.243
He needed money all the time.

11:27.903 --> 11:28.324
He lived.

11:28.344 --> 11:29.665
He was a freelance critic.

11:30.185 --> 11:31.667
That's how he made his livelihood.

11:32.148 --> 11:37.657
He sent me, in this collection, have to be at least 50 wonderful Cowley books with annotations of his.

11:38.378 --> 11:39.440
I'm off the track.

11:39.641 --> 11:46.271
In this collection, because I found that it was terribly important, once he and I started collecting, no collector would have got all those books.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.553
They wouldn't have wanted them.

11:47.574 --> 11:55.426
I have all of Kleanth Brooks' annotated copies, about 250 strong, from his library of all his Faulkner books.

11:55.446 --> 11:55.827
They're here?

11:56.007 --> 11:56.428
They're here.

11:57.134 --> 11:57.815
They're wonderful.

11:57.835 --> 12:00.018
I've got all of Joe Blotner's books annotated.

12:00.358 --> 12:02.962
I've got some Chiardi, George Marion O'Donnell.

12:03.002 --> 12:04.564
C-I-A-R-D-I.

12:04.884 --> 12:06.847
Let me show you the other book that Malcolm sent me.

12:07.448 --> 12:12.535
He said, I know you're not going to want this one, but I do have one that you might share.

12:12.935 --> 12:17.842
In fact, of course, this one is just her, the one I just showed you.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.464
That's magnificent.

12:19.484 --> 12:25.031
Let me show you another one.

12:25.051 --> 12:25.592
Give me a half tray.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.213
Let me see if I can

12:28.657 --> 12:31.060
Look at this one.

12:31.080 --> 12:37.006
This is, again, one of the absolutely premier collector's books in this collection.

12:38.728 --> 12:40.270
And I believe it's this one.

12:40.971 --> 12:42.152
Look at that binding.

12:42.352 --> 12:43.494
Yeah, the binding's beautiful.

12:43.594 --> 12:45.036
Oh, but gosh, I'm a collector.

12:45.056 --> 12:45.937
There's no dust jacket.

12:45.957 --> 12:48.099
Who would want this book?

12:48.119 --> 12:49.961
Well, who would want this book?

12:51.142 --> 12:57.870
When Cowley was doing his portable Faulkner, writing that scintillating introduction, he wrote that he himself

12:58.357 --> 13:03.063
and he went on record with this, said he couldn't find a copy of The Sound and the Fury.

13:03.623 --> 13:05.405
Sorry, I got it backwards, so we'll get it right.

13:06.387 --> 13:12.334
He was writing back and forth to Faulkner, and he was asking questions about such and such as he was writing it.

13:13.115 --> 13:20.904
And Faulkner said, I don't have a copy of the book, and for me to answer those questions, would you mind sending me your copy?

13:21.425 --> 13:28.313
Well, Cowley didn't have a first printing either because he wrote somewhere that he had a whole lot of trouble finding a first edition of The Sound and the Fury because it was out of print.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.698
So he sent Falkner his third printing.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.822
It's from 31.

13:34.083 --> 13:34.764
It was still old.

13:34.784 --> 13:36.106
It was two years off the first printing.

13:36.246 --> 13:37.990
He wasn't the first printing.

13:38.511 --> 13:40.715
Who was he kidding?

13:40.735 --> 13:42.137
He sent Falkner his own book.

13:42.177 --> 13:46.765
And on the second free flyleaf, he put his own name, which he did in all his books.

13:47.306 --> 13:52.596
But when Falkner and Cowley finished their correspondence, Falkner sent him two gifts.

13:52.947 --> 14:02.398
One was one of his first copies of The Portable Faulkner that he received from Viking, and that's the one he inscribed that went for sale in that auction that I missed.

14:03.780 --> 14:17.436
But the second one that he inscribed that I got from Cowley in Malcolm's last years was this copy, that when he had finished, he sent back to Cowley, Cowley's book, but this time it had

14:17.888 --> 14:19.171
This inscription to Malcolm.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.013
Let's read it.

14:20.033 --> 14:27.051
To Malcolm Cowley, who beat me to what was to have been the leisurely pleasure of my old age, William Faulkner.

14:27.071 --> 14:31.442
And what he meant by that simply was Faulkner always dreamed when he got older and lost his fire.

14:31.844 --> 14:36.373
that he'd lost his fire, that he would put together his own compilation of his favorites.

14:36.914 --> 14:41.603
And in fact, he's saying here, you beat me to what was to have been the leisurely pleasure of my old age.

14:41.623 --> 14:43.467
Well, that's a very important inscription, isn't it?

14:43.487 --> 14:44.288
Wonderful inscription.

14:44.308 --> 14:45.250
But important, too.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.396
It does have a biographical insight, I think.

14:48.457 --> 14:51.743
I think that's the single most important thought inscription I think.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.164
I agree.

14:53.264 --> 14:54.826
Bob just said that.

14:55.386 --> 14:56.287
Let's pick up on that.

14:56.307 --> 14:57.648
Why do you say that?

14:57.788 --> 14:59.870
That's the single most important Faulkner inscription.

14:59.890 --> 15:09.618
I think that is, in part because of the significance of the portable Faulkner and what Cowley did for Faulkner's career and reputation.

15:09.698 --> 15:16.384
And then it says a lot about how Faulkner felt about, I mean, he knew that Cowley had rendered him a great service.

15:16.484 --> 15:19.186
And that was at a time when he couldn't pay his bills.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.308
And so there's that.

15:22.148 --> 15:30.136
It says a lot about Faulkner, but it also is that tribute from Faulkner to Cowley, this man that, in a sense, revived his career.

15:30.276 --> 15:36.402
It also renders irrelevant the question of whether or not it's a first edition, doesn't it?

15:36.422 --> 15:36.662
Yes, indeed.

15:36.682 --> 15:39.244
It's a third printing, isn't that correct?

15:39.264 --> 15:45.030
But printing at that point, of course, that's a book, but it takes on another dimension.

15:45.671 --> 15:47.052
Now it's an archival item.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.593
Well, that's another thing about L.D.'

15:48.573 --> 15:51.396
's collection, the thoroughness with which he collects.

15:52.017 --> 15:58.224
I've learned what I know about book collecting very little, but I knew nothing when I met L.D.

15:58.344 --> 16:00.346
Anything I know I've learned from observing him.

16:00.426 --> 16:07.854
But what's impressed me is he wants the second printings, the third printings, the whole run, as he says.

16:09.255 --> 16:14.861
Most collectors, I understand, would just want first edition, first printings, met condition.

16:14.901 --> 16:21.248
You really don't go for the foreign editions the way Carl did.

16:21.329 --> 16:25.234
Carl went for those because he had such an obsessiveness in wanting things.

16:25.254 --> 16:28.279
Always wanted mail coming to him, packages coming in.

16:28.799 --> 16:31.083
Shit he could open.

16:31.143 --> 16:36.831
And the distinction is, and I don't want you to put this into the record either, because I still qualify.

16:36.951 --> 16:39.154
I love Carl as a human being.

16:39.174 --> 16:43.921
If I'm going to get books, I ain't going to buy ten books that are all copies of each other.

16:44.501 --> 16:49.969
I just went on record with you as showing you the copy that Malcolm, the copy of the portable Faulkner,

16:51.080 --> 16:54.244
that Faulkner inscribed from Malcolm Cowley in 1948.

16:54.444 --> 16:59.750
Remember I told you that out of that auction, what was it I said it was, the name of it?

17:00.071 --> 17:00.791
Jonathan Goodwin.

17:01.272 --> 17:03.635
Out of the Jonathan Goodwin auction, listen to this, it's a neat story.

17:04.155 --> 17:07.700
Out of that one, I missed that great book.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.664
And though I got eight or ten, my heart was broken, but I didn't have eight grand to spend.

17:11.704 --> 17:13.847
I was buying the other ones for like $1,500, two grand.

17:14.628 --> 17:16.530
That was still pretty good pops at that time.

17:17.033 --> 17:26.342
Someone bought that book, and it was reputed on the coast for about $6,500 out of the auction, but by the time they paid the auction house and then the dealer who bought it for them, they paid about $8,000.

17:26.442 --> 17:28.945
That was a whopper in the late 70s.

17:29.345 --> 17:31.247
That book today is about a $60,000 book.

17:32.588 --> 17:42.838
The book I've got was signed two years later in the only time Faulkner met Malcolm Cowley, and that was because Cowley took him home with him from New York.

17:43.118 --> 17:46.922
He got real sick, Faulkner did, alcoholically sick that weekend,

17:47.408 --> 17:50.994
Malcolm took him home to meet his wife and to stay at the house and to have him recover.

17:51.475 --> 17:57.524
That's also the time that they wrote that wonderful thing, that little essay he wrote called... New England.

17:57.704 --> 17:59.547
Yeah, what is it about New England?

17:59.567 --> 18:00.849
A Guest's View of New England.

18:01.050 --> 18:02.112
A Guest's View of New England.

18:02.132 --> 18:03.153
He wrote that.

18:03.173 --> 18:04.796
A Guest's View of New England.

18:05.437 --> 18:07.700
In all places and four times.

18:08.622 --> 18:14.952
A wonderful little travel piece about how he went up to the East Coast, went up to Connecticut in the autumn, in October.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.248
and how beautiful it was.

18:16.308 --> 18:20.732
And yet he wrote all about his perception of Yankees and what they're all about.

18:20.752 --> 18:23.235
He signed a whole row of Malcolm's books at that time.

18:23.275 --> 18:25.417
So the one I got, I got after all.

18:25.657 --> 18:30.281
Isn't that ironic that where you think there's just one and generally there is, I'll be damned.

18:30.462 --> 18:31.803
So I have a portable Faulkner.

18:32.063 --> 18:33.204
Well, let me show you what else I got.

18:33.244 --> 18:36.147
And this came out of Oxford, out of Roanoke itself.

18:36.948 --> 18:42.593
If that wasn't enough to get the copy that Faulkner signed to...

18:45.070 --> 19:01.605
to Cowley, how about having also, as a companion piece to that, when Malcolm received his free copies from Viking, the first thing he did was, naturally, to reciprocate and send Faulkner a signed copy of the book.

19:02.005 --> 19:06.209
To William Faulkner, permanent admirer, Malcolm Cowley, May 1946.

19:06.389 --> 19:06.850
Right on.

19:07.470 --> 19:10.333
A pre-publication date of the book.

19:10.353 --> 19:12.715
Now, you couldn't have two books neater.

19:13.049 --> 19:16.093
more significant in book collecting than those two books.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.416
Now, I got that out of Oxford, out of the Faulkner family.

19:18.937 --> 19:20.559
I got the other one from Malcolm directly.

19:20.880 --> 19:21.520
How did I get them?

19:21.601 --> 19:22.782
They never came to a book dealer.

19:22.822 --> 19:23.623
They never were going to.

19:24.024 --> 19:26.647
And had they, I couldn't have afforded them.

19:26.667 --> 19:34.538
Well, early on when I told you about the Vance Carter brooch story and how exciting that was and how it got me on the track, I'll be damned.

19:35.459 --> 19:42.769
One of the only reasons I wasn't heartbroken of heartbrokens when I missed the one at the Jonathan Goodwin sale was because, in fact,

19:43.390 --> 19:48.880
I did have an inscribed portable Faulkner, but it wasn't as significant as the one.

19:49.281 --> 19:57.736
This was one that William signed for his cousin, Vance Carter Broach, from his cousin, William Faulkner.

19:57.756 --> 20:04.048
Well, Vance traded me this book, and it's doubly inscribed, as so many in the later years were, on the title page, William Faulkner.

20:04.383 --> 20:06.826
Oxford, Mississippi, 28 November 1947.

20:06.946 --> 20:10.570
Doubly inscribed for the record means he's inscribed twice.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.831
Once on the end sheet.

20:12.272 --> 20:13.953
Once on the free front end paper.

20:13.973 --> 20:16.616
On the free front end paper and on the half title of the title.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.139
Oh, I didn't want to do what I just did.

20:19.159 --> 20:19.680
What did you do?

20:19.700 --> 20:21.281
I bent the page a little bit.

20:21.442 --> 20:23.884
I'm not in carelessness.

20:23.904 --> 20:25.246
He did this quite often.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.668
He's going to go to the final.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.409
You can talk later.

20:28.429 --> 20:31.993
Okay, so anyway, that's another wonderful inscribed portable.

20:32.210 --> 20:34.653
I want to show you one that I like even better than all of those.

20:34.713 --> 20:40.440
I've got one, Nick, that I'm even more fond of.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.946
Go ahead.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.067
This is signed 730-78.

20:49.712 --> 20:58.783
And this one is only a lowly, very beautiful dust jacket, very beautiful first edition that it says I paid $6.50 for at one point.

20:58.803 --> 20:59.344
$6.50?

20:59.364 --> 21:01.727
No, $6.50.

21:02.247 --> 21:06.933
But it's inscribed for... I don't have that particular title in my department.

21:07.013 --> 21:08.314
It's inscribed for L.D.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.537
Brodsky, Malcolm Cowley.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.860
73078.

21:13.601 --> 21:15.483
So that's what I would call something.

21:15.523 --> 21:16.804
That's book collecting to me.

21:17.826 --> 21:20.529
All that one that I just showed you, there are four of those there.

21:20.549 --> 21:21.630
That is book collecting.

21:21.670 --> 21:23.893
Now there are other portables that I have.

21:23.913 --> 21:25.595
I've got Client's copy of the portable.

21:26.256 --> 21:27.657
I've got Jim Silver's copy.

21:27.878 --> 21:29.760
I've got Bezerides' copy.

21:29.780 --> 21:30.200
Who else?

21:30.220 --> 21:31.021
We'd have to look in there.

21:31.041 --> 21:31.562
I forgot.

21:32.167 --> 21:36.872
I have an inscribed copy from Faulkner to his friend.

21:38.493 --> 21:39.654
No, I don't.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.576
I was going to say Phil Stone.

21:41.596 --> 21:43.378
Delete that.

21:43.638 --> 21:45.380
Skip that one line.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.861
Let me show you some more exciting.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.664
Does this give you a kick to watch this?

21:50.265 --> 21:51.125
Because he gets excited.

21:51.486 --> 21:53.628
Well, yeah, it does.

21:53.908 --> 21:58.933
He'll tell you he's more interested in the books than I am.

21:59.116 --> 22:01.218
Again, it's the letters and manuscripts.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.380
No, but I mean when you see him get excited.

22:03.400 --> 22:03.681
Oh, yeah.

22:03.701 --> 22:06.643
Animation, excitement, enthusiasm.

22:06.704 --> 22:09.707
I mean, do you have that kind of above?

22:10.647 --> 22:11.528
Have you ever been a collector?

22:11.548 --> 22:12.950
No, no.

22:12.970 --> 22:14.051
Paperbacks are good enough for me.

22:14.151 --> 22:16.974
You're not marking them, triple scored them, underlining them.

22:17.114 --> 22:20.738
So does it amuse you to see this kind of obsession?

22:22.059 --> 22:23.120
I don't think that's quite the right word.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.201
That's not the right word.

22:24.401 --> 22:25.202
I admire it.

22:25.282 --> 22:25.943
I admire it.

22:26.063 --> 22:28.245
It's not an interest I have.

22:29.069 --> 22:38.798
Again, I tend to get more excited over the manuscript material, because that has more scholarly possibilities.

22:41.140 --> 22:45.283
I love the books, and I've learned a lot about them, and watching L.D.

22:45.624 --> 22:53.290
put them together, the collection together, and much of it, and build it, but... What, basically, is the Brotsky?

22:53.310 --> 22:55.052
Those nine cases there?

22:55.072 --> 22:57.854
Yeah, and around the corner in the first... So there are ten?

22:58.094 --> 22:58.755
Yeah, right.

23:00.119 --> 23:03.284
And there's more upstairs that we haven't had to put in here.

23:03.304 --> 23:07.490
We've still got to do a lot of work in this room and put doors on these cases back here.

23:07.511 --> 23:11.116
So this will incorporate Breitsky's stuff?

23:11.136 --> 23:12.518
Will this whole room be Breitsky's stuff?

23:12.538 --> 23:15.803
Well, there's a small, called the Harrison Collection back here.

23:15.924 --> 23:23.916
He was a member of our Board of Regents, and he was kind of a dilettante book collector.

23:24.385 --> 23:33.476
random, eclectic kind of, there's some good stuff in it, but it's not focused, and it's not very large, but that's the only other collection in here.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.761
What was in here prior to the arrival of Wawrotsky's stuff?

23:37.781 --> 23:39.784
Nothing.

23:39.804 --> 23:40.305
Empty space.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.247
I want to do one more rundown like this.

23:42.467 --> 23:43.489
Really?

23:43.509 --> 23:52.840
I wonder what happened was when Harrison wanted to give his small collection to the university, since we're not a research institution, have not been previously,

23:53.309 --> 23:58.016
The family wanted to have a room to house the Harrison collection.

23:58.036 --> 24:01.260
And so they furnished the room, and this room was here.

24:01.381 --> 24:02.943
It was used, nobody ever came in here.

24:03.063 --> 24:09.052
It just housed a few little... So the Harrison family funded this room, I gather.

24:09.512 --> 24:11.936
In the 1950s, I guess.

24:12.456 --> 24:14.559
And what was Harrison's first name?

24:14.579 --> 24:15.781
He's over here on this plaque.

24:15.801 --> 24:16.282
Charles.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.907
See, we haven't done this for real, do you, yet?

24:20.900 --> 24:25.885
When Harrison died in 1944, Charles Harrison, he was a local businessman.

24:25.945 --> 24:27.907
Charles Luce Harrison, right.

24:28.688 --> 24:30.289
And he was on the Board of Regents here.

24:31.010 --> 24:37.976
And when this library was built in 68, the new library, they created this room to house this collection that he had given the university.

24:39.098 --> 24:40.719
And it was seldom used.

24:40.739 --> 24:46.745
And so this room, beautiful room, the family provided the furnishings and all, and it was built.

24:46.805 --> 24:49.928
But then when we moved the Brodsky collection in, we had to do a lot of

24:50.110 --> 24:51.491
renovation.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.094
Why take the time to write it?

24:54.134 --> 25:04.445
We had to add the security and the cases and so on to house the Brodsky collection.

25:04.465 --> 25:07.429
I'm not going to show you a lot more, but I'm going to show you a few more.

25:07.449 --> 25:10.772
I do want to see some manuscript stuff that's up there, too.

25:10.832 --> 25:15.757
I'm going to let both of us show you some of those, even while I'm gone.

25:16.358 --> 25:18.160
But I want to show you a couple more classic things.

25:19.658 --> 25:21.300
because you will enjoy it.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.121
They're all variants.

25:22.541 --> 25:24.283
We're going to bring them out bibliographically.

25:24.303 --> 25:25.785
The finest collection of British.

25:26.105 --> 25:29.028
Yes, and one of them, they're all distinct.

25:29.749 --> 25:41.562
They're all bibliographic anomalies, but I'm going to show you only one out of the whole group that is just absolutely my favorite.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.683
I'm going to bring it over to you.

25:42.723 --> 25:44.966
This is it.

25:45.026 --> 25:45.827
Okay.

25:46.627 --> 25:48.009
We have a finest copy of Sardarist.

25:48.049 --> 25:48.990
What a piece of junk.

25:49.072 --> 25:49.833
Look at that.

25:49.853 --> 25:57.947
Oh, but now, what if you found something exciting in it, and then you said to yourself, if you're Carter Burden, maybe, oh, I'll send it out to the conservator and have a new one.

25:57.967 --> 26:08.646
I'll buy another copy for a thousand bucks, and I'll just have them change the covers, and then I'll have a perfectly fine book, which is the impulse that drives a lot of collectors.

26:09.307 --> 26:13.915
My feeling is that you leave a book intact, as it was, as an artifact.

26:14.165 --> 26:15.707
This book is absolutely shabby.

26:15.747 --> 26:18.510
It's been eaten up by mildew and bugs and all kinds of things.

26:18.590 --> 26:22.874
It sat in the South for years, obviously in a very humid attic or something.

26:22.894 --> 26:28.480
But when I found this by accident in a bookshop down in Jackson, I was very taken aback by this piece of shit.

26:28.500 --> 26:37.089
I thought the book was going to be a $50 book, and as it turned out, they sold it to me for $200, which was okay because on the fly leaf it's inscribed by Faulkner.

26:37.149 --> 26:39.632
It says, To Uncle John and Aunt Sue from Bill.

26:40.068 --> 26:46.397
17 February 1929, doubly inscribed on the title page, William Faulkner, 19 Feb, 27, 29 of me.

26:46.437 --> 26:47.378
$200?

26:47.518 --> 26:47.799
Yeah.

26:51.964 --> 26:53.186
I thought, okay, fair enough.

26:53.286 --> 26:54.868
Maybe no one ever looked inside the book.

26:55.249 --> 26:55.730
Can I help you?

26:55.750 --> 26:57.752
The book is awful.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.316
The condition of the book is awful.

27:00.336 --> 27:01.758
The book is absolutely superb.

27:02.199 --> 27:06.885
If there were nothing in it, $3.00.

27:07.203 --> 27:10.288
Well, if it weren't a first edition, maybe 25 cents.

27:10.628 --> 27:10.928
Maybe.

27:11.569 --> 27:11.890
You know?

27:12.571 --> 27:12.871
Maybe.

27:13.592 --> 27:13.853
Yeah.

27:14.293 --> 27:16.477
There really wasn't a second edition of that book.

27:16.497 --> 27:19.261
Uncle John and Aunt, how do we spell it?

27:19.281 --> 27:19.942
Sue.

27:20.202 --> 27:21.384
Sue from Ville.

27:22.506 --> 27:23.767
17th Feb 29th.

27:23.848 --> 27:25.089
Pretty nice, huh?

27:25.109 --> 27:25.851
Yeah, pretty nice.

27:26.251 --> 27:30.097
So, there's a case where a lot of collectors would have passed on that book.

27:30.117 --> 27:32.020
You really think... I am absolutely positive.

27:33.121 --> 27:34.143
I've watched them do it.

27:34.183 --> 27:36.366
Carter would not have bought that book five years ago.

27:36.532 --> 27:40.618
Well, the association value, I mean, you have to be a moron not to recognize me.

27:40.638 --> 27:42.020
Call it how you want it.

27:43.282 --> 27:47.529
Bob and I have seen that time and time again.

27:48.911 --> 27:52.176
Why did people not buy Emily Stone's collection for $50,000?

27:52.516 --> 27:55.040
Well, a lot of the stuff was a little shabby looking.

27:55.621 --> 27:56.823
Didn't look real nice.

27:57.624 --> 28:00.669
And the movie scripts.

28:00.749 --> 28:04.615
Nobody wanted those because that one wasn't a good script, Rob.

28:05.219 --> 28:08.902
These two books look like pretty much junk out of Emily Stone's collection.

28:09.543 --> 28:15.729
Nobody wanted to buy the scripts because there wasn't... Well, Fulton... Very few of his movies were ever filmed, I mean, if any, right?

28:16.149 --> 28:17.691
Right, but he wrote a lot more.

28:17.731 --> 28:24.938
No one wanted to pay Emily Stone $50,000, and she was thrilled to have $35,000, which busted my ass to put that together.

28:25.818 --> 28:28.521
Only when I looked at that, I told you I valued the collection.

28:29.001 --> 28:32.004
Here were just a bunch of random books that were Phil's books.

28:32.445 --> 28:35.007
Only this one says in Bill Fulton's hand...

28:35.645 --> 28:41.611
From Bill to Phil, Xmas, 1923, and Phil, characteristically, more than once would assign his name to that.

28:41.631 --> 28:43.993
Why did he do a... He just thought a lot of himself.

28:44.874 --> 28:46.035
He was really stuck on himself.

28:46.075 --> 28:47.937
Some of the books we have have three signatures in them.

28:48.137 --> 28:50.199
And, of course, he wanted to outdo Bill.

28:50.960 --> 28:51.860
So he's in there twice.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.282
But is that wonderful?

28:53.302 --> 28:55.003
Well, that's a wonderful, wonderful book.

28:55.023 --> 28:57.045
That's pre-Marble Fawn.

28:57.786 --> 28:59.247
Here's a book that had a great effect.

28:59.267 --> 29:02.370
Antic, A-N-T-I-C, Antic, by Elvis Huxley.

29:02.390 --> 29:04.032
Yeah, and a very famous book still read.

29:04.670 --> 29:05.631
Still a red book.

29:05.771 --> 29:07.073
And influential on Faulkner.

29:07.093 --> 29:09.756
Influential on Faulkner, and here's one even more influential.

29:10.056 --> 29:15.342
Maybe I missed it, but why would he get a copy of a Huxley title?

29:15.763 --> 29:16.684
Well, because he loved it.

29:17.204 --> 29:18.946
And he thought Stone would love it.

29:18.967 --> 29:20.428
Whose annotations are these in here?

29:20.448 --> 29:20.929
Stone.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.271
And all those books have wonderful stone annotations.

29:24.072 --> 29:25.674
Let me tell you something about that little story.

29:26.235 --> 29:27.717
I went back because I'm real thorough.

29:27.877 --> 29:32.382
I had bought everything once I made the first visit, then I made a second visit to Emily.

29:32.513 --> 29:33.214
Where are we going?

29:33.234 --> 29:35.416
Down in Montgomery, Alabama in the 70s.

29:36.697 --> 29:39.159
And then I said, Emily, I think I need to come down again.

29:39.199 --> 29:44.344
You had once mentioned you had some books under the bed, but your back hurt and you couldn't move them, and I know I never saw them.

29:45.365 --> 29:46.246
I flew down again.

29:46.266 --> 29:48.167
It was about 300 bucks to fly down there.

29:48.688 --> 29:51.150
Sure enough, I went through all the books on the shelf and nothing much.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.111
I hadn't missed much there.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.014
I said, the box you mentioned under the bed.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.618
She pulled out all these books that are what I call the Stone Survivors.

30:00.087 --> 30:07.456
But that was worth the trip, because there was Anna Kay, and here was a book that really influenced Faulkner when he was a young man, and it influenced everybody in the country.

30:07.516 --> 30:10.780
It was called Juergen by James Branch Cabell.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.042
Real significant book.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.023
And here's this book.

30:14.043 --> 30:15.445
Why is it spelled Juergen?

30:16.186 --> 30:17.788
J-U-R-G-E-N.

30:18.148 --> 30:18.629
By whom?

30:18.649 --> 30:20.371
I don't know the title.

30:20.511 --> 30:22.673
By James Branch Cabell.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.757
C-A-B-E-L-L.

30:25.855 --> 30:30.700
Only this one also was the second gift that apparently Faulkner gave to Phil at Christmas.

30:31.101 --> 30:36.407
And he had one in his own library, signed William Faulkner, Roanoke, an earlier edition.

30:36.447 --> 30:42.153
This might have been an 11th printing, as I recall, and Faulkner had the 9th, or this might be the 13th, and he had the 11th.

30:42.894 --> 30:43.635
This is 1923.

30:45.738 --> 30:48.401
You can tell how popular it was in the same year.

30:49.041 --> 30:51.644
We were already up to the 13th printing.

30:51.664 --> 30:52.485
It was real racy.

30:53.106 --> 30:54.107
It was Rabelazian.

30:54.931 --> 30:56.212
This is the 13th printing.

30:56.232 --> 31:00.077
Faulkner has in his library the 11th printing.

31:00.757 --> 31:02.059
That's an incredible book.

31:02.079 --> 31:05.583
Out of that same box came a book that Faulkner really loved.

31:05.603 --> 31:10.167
It was a very influential book in the teens called Some Imagist Poets.

31:10.187 --> 31:13.311
It was the imagist manifesto.

31:13.331 --> 31:19.097
It had people like Amy Lowell, Richard Aldington.

31:19.818 --> 31:23.001
Let's see, some of the others are... Fletcher.

31:23.021 --> 31:23.101
H.D.

31:23.121 --> 31:23.622
H.D., right.

31:24.378 --> 31:37.211
And here was Stone's underlined copy, but this was a book that Faulkner obviously had in his hand because Faulkner had done the labels, make labels, and had, we think, rebounded the book.

31:38.212 --> 31:43.417
It was issued as a paperback, and the back binders are in there still, the wrappers are still in the book.

31:43.637 --> 31:48.942
We think he bound it by hand, that's what Emily said, and that these were his labels on there, and that was in that box.

31:49.443 --> 31:52.205
You know, but it really influenced him a lot.

31:52.225 --> 31:52.866
Here's a book.

31:55.462 --> 31:57.304
Oh, I took the wrong one out of the shelf there.

31:57.924 --> 31:59.165
I pulled the wrong one.

32:00.226 --> 32:01.507
It's just another inscribed copy.

32:02.268 --> 32:07.772
And here's a copy that most collectors wouldn't buy, Nick, because it's a third print of The Sound and the Fury.

32:08.453 --> 32:16.680
But isn't it wonderful because it's inscribed on the second free front end page for Mrs. Eva Newman-Gilmore, William Faulkner, Oxford Miss, 15 October 1935.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.424
Faulkner inscriptions, let alone presentations, are exceedingly rare.

32:22.465 --> 32:24.126
This is wonderful that it's a third printing.

32:24.146 --> 32:24.827
Who gives a hoot?

32:25.246 --> 32:31.357
except all your major collectors feel that if it's not a first printing, it's somehow tainted.

32:31.377 --> 32:32.679
That's ridiculous.

32:32.719 --> 32:36.506
The significance of that particular presentation is what?

32:37.828 --> 32:39.171
Nothing.

32:39.572 --> 32:40.774
Nothing.

32:40.794 --> 32:41.595
Just that it's rare.

32:41.615 --> 32:44.841
If you set aside the silent limited editions,

32:45.952 --> 32:50.577
would you guess there may be no more than 500 Faulkner inscriptions?

32:50.798 --> 32:52.360
I would say he probably didn't inscribe.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.021
Hemingway inscribed thousands.

32:54.102 --> 32:58.587
And there are probably almost 200 of those in this collection.

32:58.607 --> 32:59.408
Right.

32:59.428 --> 33:00.249
About 200?

33:00.509 --> 33:01.911
Yes.

33:02.692 --> 33:07.377
Of the known or the estimated Faulkner inscriptions.

33:07.758 --> 33:10.481
This is the greatest Faulkner book collection in the world.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.085
See, the part that I don't get excited about

33:14.470 --> 33:16.433
As excited about it, I should say.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.100
It's the best in the world.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.444
As a popular book collection, this one is unrivaled.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.448
You could put the others together.

33:24.508 --> 33:29.837
In terms of signed inscriptions, you wouldn't have the number that are here.

33:29.857 --> 33:36.569
If you combine the three other major Texas, Mississippi, Virginia.

33:36.589 --> 33:38.773
I think I know why I didn't find that one, Bob.

33:39.428 --> 33:41.611
Faulkner inscriptions, much less acquire them.

33:41.791 --> 33:43.133
Do you start again with, it's remarkable?

33:43.393 --> 33:50.722
It's remarkable that one individual could even locate that percentage of signed Faulkner books, much less acquire them.

33:51.743 --> 34:02.417
Because Faulkner just didn't sign that many books in his lifetime, except, apart from the signed limited editions, which were done by... See, he felt that he had a sense that this was money in the bank.

34:02.597 --> 34:06.702
I mean, Faulkner, the value of a book is greater if there were fewer...

34:07.576 --> 34:08.998
Yes, indeed, he did.

34:09.178 --> 34:10.479
And he really didn't like it.

34:10.519 --> 34:10.900
He did.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.443
That's all he had to trade on.

34:13.483 --> 34:16.206
Didn't Alfred Krupp ask him once to inscribe a book to him?

34:16.226 --> 34:17.948
He said no, or then he thought about it.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.710
That may very well be the case.

34:19.730 --> 34:20.872
And you're absolutely right.

34:21.192 --> 34:26.599
He has written in letters we have that all he had to trade on were his manuscripts, his writing.

34:26.619 --> 34:27.640
And he knew they'd be valuable.

34:27.660 --> 34:32.365
He didn't attend autograph parties, he didn't have that many bestsellers, and he generally didn't sign books for funds.

34:32.385 --> 34:35.389
See, there's only one signed limited Hemingway book.

34:36.196 --> 34:42.784
Faulkner to his, you know, these are sign limiters and they want some money because... Well, these are, no, these are not that I'm doing on the sign limiters.

34:42.804 --> 34:48.952
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I know what I'm saying, but these are not, obviously, but he did, what, perhaps half a dozen?

34:48.992 --> 34:49.833
No, he did 12.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.435
12, I mean, books.

34:51.835 --> 34:52.896
Hemingway did just one.

34:53.297 --> 34:53.397
Yeah.

34:53.417 --> 34:56.160
And he, you know, and he probably, you know, thought that was a half-ass.

34:56.180 --> 35:00.326
Well, they thought they had an audience for him, enough of an audience that would subscribe to those books.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.347
Yeah, but he had a sense.

35:01.427 --> 35:05.612
I think it indicated he knew that... His publishers asked him to do those sign limiters.

35:05.828 --> 35:06.409
Is that right?

35:06.429 --> 35:09.433
Those were their behests because they had an audience.

35:09.974 --> 35:13.078
You could sell this book for $250, but you could sell a sign limited for $5.

35:13.759 --> 35:16.683
And it's the same damn book bound up in a slightly more deluxe binding.

35:17.083 --> 35:19.467
And all he had to do, they'd send him the sheets and he'd sign them.

35:19.507 --> 35:20.268
He didn't mind doing that.

35:20.288 --> 35:22.230
They sent him 10 free copies.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.935
And they didn't even do that with Hemingway because Hemingway would sell enough copies of the trade edition.

35:25.955 --> 35:26.436
That's right.

35:26.669 --> 35:30.473
They needed to sign limiteds with Faulkner because he sold so poorly.

35:30.493 --> 35:30.973
That's right.

35:31.174 --> 35:34.397
To make it more feasible for them to publish the book.

35:34.457 --> 35:37.060
Let me show you a couple more things that I want to go at.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.483
And I'm sort of bombarding you, but we don't have enough time.

35:41.124 --> 35:42.005
This is another book.

35:42.045 --> 35:46.269
I told you I showed you Unvanquished that came out of Faulkner's own library that was his own.

35:46.289 --> 35:49.973
I showed you the Mississippi, the Miss Zilphia Gantt.

35:49.993 --> 35:55.258
Here is another book that his early British publishers, Chateau and Windus, sent him.

35:55.593 --> 35:59.196
This was the second book that was published by Chateau and Windus.

35:59.297 --> 36:06.904
It was an English version, and this particular version has a little label in it that says, sample copy, not for sale.

36:06.924 --> 36:12.869
This was an early bind-up of his second British publication, The Sound and the Fury.

36:14.571 --> 36:18.134
Only this one has a real distinction to it.

36:18.154 --> 36:21.698
This one was the copy that went to William from the publisher.

36:23.039 --> 36:25.161
It was the sample copy, and it has in it

36:25.445 --> 36:31.622
on the free front flyleaf and paper, William Faulkner, Oxford Miss, 8 May, 1931.

36:31.702 --> 36:35.592
This was Faulkner's own personal shelf copy.

36:36.615 --> 36:38.841
And he put his names in them like that and he kept them.

36:39.483 --> 36:41.007
This came out of the Faulkner family.

36:41.054 --> 36:42.195
What do you feel?

36:42.576 --> 36:43.737
It blows me away.

36:43.757 --> 36:46.119
It was his own bad damn book.

36:46.159 --> 36:47.941
That's wonderful because it was his.

36:48.001 --> 36:49.643
He held it just like I'm holding it now.

36:49.683 --> 36:58.592
He opened it just like I'm doing now and he took his little, his pen and put his little signature in there with his place and his date because that is what he was.

36:58.952 --> 37:04.277
He was William Faulkner of Oxford, Mississippi and he had a nice reputation at that point.

37:04.698 --> 37:05.659
Wasn't he excited?

37:06.059 --> 37:09.002
Here is his British publisher publishing his second book.

37:09.522 --> 37:14.128
And here is his British publisher publishing his first book.

37:15.129 --> 37:23.661
Only in the first book that they sent him, which he put in his library as his own copy, he felt very proud of this one.

37:23.701 --> 37:33.273
This came out in 1930, the same year that he got married to Estelle Oldham Franklin.

37:33.293 --> 37:38.500
And in this copy he wrote Estelle and William Faulkner, July 14th.

37:38.918 --> 38:07.272
1930 that gives me goose pimples because what better book could you possibly have than Faulkner's first British publication of a book that he said ah my wife and I we don't have a child yet we have a home in Oxford we are now a family of two I showed you before when he put in his book we're a family of three his daughter you couldn't have a more beautiful book than this and it's his own copy and here he's saying it's not my library it's our library

38:07.927 --> 38:11.270
It's not my book, it's our book, Estelle's and Mine.

38:15.013 --> 38:16.595
That's a wonderful, wonderful book.

38:17.075 --> 38:19.017
I mean, it was class.

38:20.318 --> 38:21.719
Here's another one that's pretty classy.

38:22.160 --> 38:36.212
When I went to Princeton, and I made a number of trips to visit Dorothy Cummins, who was Sax's wife, widow, one of the great books that she had in her collection was a book that Faulkner hadn't signed, but rather the

38:36.614 --> 38:41.959
author of the book that was given by the author to Faulkner.

38:41.979 --> 38:56.793
And it turned out that this book was called Ideas and Opinions, and it was a book that was published in 54, right about the time when Saxon, Dorothy, and Bill, who was visiting the Cumminses in Princeton, walked over a couple blocks to Albert Einstein's home.

38:56.813 --> 39:05.862
And at that time, Einstein took his newly received published book, Ideas and Opinions, and inscribed on the flyleaf to Mr. Faulkner.

39:06.162 --> 39:08.504
Without Obligo, A. Einstein.

39:09.365 --> 39:11.948
Now that's my favorite book.

39:11.968 --> 39:13.389
Now I have the dust jacket for that.

39:13.469 --> 39:14.510
I haven't picked it up yet.

39:15.031 --> 39:15.671
It's all ripped.

39:16.012 --> 39:16.893
Faulkner held it.

39:17.233 --> 39:18.434
Einstein held it.

39:18.734 --> 39:20.176
Einstein held this book.

39:20.476 --> 39:22.478
Faulkner held this book.

39:22.498 --> 39:24.200
Pretty profound.

39:24.720 --> 39:32.088
Ideas and Opinions by Albert Einstein.

39:33.189 --> 39:35.351
Crown Publishers, huh?

39:35.371 --> 39:35.511
Uh-huh.

39:36.115 --> 39:38.018
One Nobel Prize winner to another.

39:38.158 --> 39:38.559
Yeah.

39:39.080 --> 39:39.701
There you go.

39:40.061 --> 39:40.803
One Nobel.

39:41.924 --> 39:45.069
I can feel the gamma rays coming into my hand.

39:45.089 --> 39:45.530
Tell me.

39:46.572 --> 39:47.013
It's eerie.

39:48.435 --> 39:51.340
I think that and the Malcolm book are just the gems.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.685
I don't know if you want to tell them what you've been offering for that book or not.

39:54.705 --> 39:55.386
Yeah, I wish you would.

39:55.667 --> 39:56.267
I now forgot.

39:56.288 --> 39:57.229
What was it, like 70?

39:57.361 --> 39:57.761
I forgot.

39:57.781 --> 39:58.422
What did I tell you?

39:58.642 --> 39:59.644
It was $50,000.

39:59.684 --> 40:01.346
$50,000.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.869
You thought you could get more, but he offered $50,000.

40:03.889 --> 40:04.910
$50,000, that's right.

40:04.930 --> 40:06.011
That was three years ago now.

40:06.051 --> 40:06.792
That was a book dealer.

40:07.393 --> 40:10.076
So they obviously had a... Yeah, but I don't want to get into that.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.139
To Mr. Farmer... $50,000 is right.

40:13.219 --> 40:14.141
I was offered $50,000.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.622
But you said you thought he would pay more.

40:15.642 --> 40:17.264
Well, I know now it would go for more.

40:17.845 --> 40:20.608
I now was told by the same dealer that he could get $75,000 for it.

40:21.329 --> 40:22.410
Without obligo.

40:22.430 --> 40:23.071
What does that mean?

40:23.111 --> 40:26.575
That means in the European tradition, you're not obliged to read it.

40:27.247 --> 40:28.889
And it was his return to favor.

40:28.989 --> 40:31.491
Yeah, Einstein, what comes after 84?

40:33.473 --> 40:34.615
This is really exciting.

40:35.395 --> 40:37.378
That is a book.

40:38.819 --> 40:40.781
I've been spoiled.

40:41.302 --> 40:44.465
I'm going to tell you a story about that one.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.286
Go ahead.

40:45.306 --> 40:47.468
There are so many great books here.

40:47.488 --> 40:48.409
I've been spoiled.

40:49.030 --> 40:53.074
But this one excites me.

40:53.114 --> 40:57.118
This one can still generate the excitement.

40:57.352 --> 40:58.614
I got a story to tell you about this.

40:59.175 --> 41:06.625
I met Jim Silver, and Jim was living with a woman, and I went and stayed with him.

41:09.809 --> 41:10.871
Go ahead, you can tell.

41:10.891 --> 41:13.735
I stayed with him, and I got to know Jim real well.

41:14.376 --> 41:16.599
And I wanted to buy some things from Jim.

41:17.039 --> 41:22.967
The lady who he was living with had said, I need to come down and visit Jim, because he's an interesting person, and he knew Pappy.

41:23.408 --> 41:26.312
So what happened, the lady he was living with was Victoria Johnson.

41:26.663 --> 41:30.548
And Victoria was the daughter of Victoria Fieldin, who was Faulkner's stepdaughter.

41:30.648 --> 41:32.891
She's a dear friend of mine, Victoria Fieldin.

41:33.352 --> 41:34.614
I'm sorry, Victoria Johnson.

41:36.336 --> 41:38.859
And Victoria said, come on down and meet Jim.

41:38.899 --> 41:40.401
He's here at the house living with me.

41:40.421 --> 41:41.223
They were in Cape Coral.

41:41.243 --> 41:43.526
It was in 1980, I guess.

41:43.546 --> 41:47.291
So I came down and I spent three or four days and I had a great lot of fun.

41:47.311 --> 41:50.615
Jim was a wonderful man, great sense of humor, very bright man.

41:51.256 --> 41:54.781
And Jim had a bunch of things, some Faulkner manuscripts, some inscribed books.

41:55.582 --> 41:55.742
And

41:57.680 --> 42:01.505
Jim had a book sitting in a hefty bag, one of those little Ziploc bags, rather.

42:01.526 --> 42:03.929
Not a hefty, a Ziploc, sitting on his dresser.

42:04.029 --> 42:05.591
And I happened to look at it one day.

42:06.112 --> 42:07.114
I said, Jim, what is this book?

42:07.134 --> 42:08.916
He said, oh, that's an interesting book.

42:08.976 --> 42:10.278
It's a book by Albert Einstein.

42:11.460 --> 42:15.425
He said it was a book that Pappy gave me.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.208
And he said, oh, I just got it back in the mail.

42:17.528 --> 42:18.470
I had sent it to someone.

42:18.510 --> 42:20.633
I had talked with someone about it, and I said I had it.

42:21.013 --> 42:22.135
They said they'd like to buy it.

42:22.857 --> 42:23.658
And I sent it to him.

42:23.698 --> 42:24.980
I don't have the dust jacket here right now.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.065
I'm having it back, linen-backed right now so that it won't fall apart.

42:28.125 --> 42:31.971
It was shabby like the Malcolm Cowley portable book was shabby.

42:33.213 --> 42:33.974
He said, I sent it.

42:34.014 --> 42:34.736
I just got it back.

42:34.756 --> 42:35.557
That's why it's sitting here.

42:35.577 --> 42:37.440
It's still in the Ziploc bag.

42:37.460 --> 42:39.223
He said, I just opened it up.

42:39.523 --> 42:40.485
It came back to me.

42:40.545 --> 42:43.409
He said, I'd offered it to a man for $200.

42:43.489 --> 42:49.759
And he said, the man sent it back to me because he said the dust jacket was all messed up.

42:50.431 --> 42:52.094
I said, oh, can I see that book?

42:52.134 --> 42:58.305
And I opened it up, and it said to Mr. Faulkner, without obligo, I told you I got this book from, I'm going to get this right.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.427
I'm going to get the whole story right.

42:59.447 --> 43:00.429
I told it to you all.

43:00.449 --> 43:02.232
Did I tell you I got this from the Cummins family?

43:02.252 --> 43:02.352
Yes.

43:02.633 --> 43:04.496
Let me correct it now that I'm talking out loud.

43:05.758 --> 43:07.581
Because I know how it got mixed up, I'll tell you.

43:07.701 --> 43:09.505
I'll tell you what's really wonderful.

43:09.525 --> 43:11.628
And I know now where the synapse is mixed up.

43:11.789 --> 43:15.375
So fix it in your, because that's a neat story too.

43:16.233 --> 43:17.235
So I said, can I see it?

43:17.355 --> 43:18.617
He said, I'd send it to this man.

43:18.677 --> 43:19.458
He said, of course you can.

43:19.478 --> 43:20.700
So I looked at it, and it blew me away.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.561
I couldn't believe we were sitting there.

43:21.581 --> 43:26.368
I couldn't believe someone had refused to buy it for $200 because the dust jacket was shabby.

43:27.330 --> 43:27.810
So here it was.

43:27.830 --> 43:28.592
He said, would you like it?

43:28.652 --> 43:29.273
I said, absolutely.

43:29.313 --> 43:30.234
Who was this offering to?

43:30.254 --> 43:30.855
Jim Silver.

43:31.376 --> 43:33.138
He was the head of the English department at Ole Miss.

43:33.639 --> 43:34.741
The history department, sorry.

43:34.761 --> 43:37.545
He was fucking his good friend.

43:37.585 --> 43:38.386
No, he had it.

43:38.406 --> 43:39.087
Why didn't he keep it?

43:39.127 --> 43:40.249
He had all kinds of stuff.

43:40.516 --> 43:41.978
He had a lot of Faulkner stuff.

43:41.998 --> 43:42.959
He knew Faulkner real well.

43:42.979 --> 43:44.281
That's why I went down to visit him.

43:44.301 --> 43:46.865
I bought all kinds of manuscripts and artifacts from him.

43:46.885 --> 43:51.011
But this book had just come back just like the day before I got down there.

43:51.031 --> 43:52.353
And I said, oh, I'd love to have that book.

43:52.493 --> 43:54.235
Now, let me tell you why I mixed up the story.

43:55.036 --> 43:57.380
When I was up in Princeton... Is that what you got it for?

43:57.400 --> 43:57.860
$200?

43:57.900 --> 43:58.741
$200.

43:59.362 --> 44:02.507
When I was in Princeton... And he was pleased to death.

44:03.208 --> 44:05.291
He loved having $200.

44:05.311 --> 44:09.156
When I was in Princeton on one of my trips, down came a book...

44:09.440 --> 44:11.682
Down came a book with all the other Faulkner books.

44:11.863 --> 44:13.785
By the way, Sacks was dearest friends.

44:13.845 --> 44:16.507
Sacks and Dorothy were dearest friends of Albert Einstein.

44:16.527 --> 44:19.511
They lived like five blocks away or something like that.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.353
They've got inscribed Einstein.

44:21.413 --> 44:22.394
She does all over her house.

44:22.434 --> 44:24.115
Photographs and things like that in all the books.

44:25.357 --> 44:28.940
Out of the bookshelf where a lot of the Faulkners were, it was actually a hutch.

44:29.761 --> 44:33.185
She brought down a book that was exactly this duplicate.

44:33.725 --> 44:34.586
And I looked at it.

44:35.187 --> 44:36.208
That's why I got mixed up.

44:36.428 --> 44:37.690
It said the same thing.

44:37.730 --> 44:38.991
To Sacks...

44:39.950 --> 44:43.898
Cummins, without obligo, A. Einstein, 54.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.303
And I said, oh, how can this be?

44:46.383 --> 44:47.385
I said, you're not going to believe it.

44:47.405 --> 44:50.291
I told her the whole story about how I had that same book.

44:50.311 --> 44:59.950
She said, oh, well, Sachs, and that's when I learned, Sachs and Bill and I went over that day to visit with Albert and

45:00.352 --> 45:02.514
He signed one book for each of the boys.

45:02.754 --> 45:03.635
She said, each of the boys.

45:04.095 --> 45:05.577
She called Saxon Bill Boy.

45:05.617 --> 45:07.759
I tried to get it.

45:08.499 --> 45:09.780
And she wouldn't part with that.

45:10.401 --> 45:11.222
That's how I got mixed up.

45:11.242 --> 45:12.583
Is that still kind of on your wish list?

45:13.203 --> 45:14.564
Well, it would be if I pursued it.

45:14.584 --> 45:15.826
I don't know what's happened at Dona.

45:15.846 --> 45:17.267
I haven't kept up with it.

45:17.287 --> 45:17.887
I'll pursue it.

45:17.927 --> 45:18.808
Don't you pursue it.

45:19.749 --> 45:21.270
I want to pursue it.

45:21.430 --> 45:23.512
There are certain things that belong in certain places.

45:23.552 --> 45:24.553
Yeah, it would belong there.

45:25.174 --> 45:25.894
It would be wonderful.

45:26.155 --> 45:27.636
Anyway, I had my hands on that book, too.

45:27.996 --> 45:28.857
Same inscription.

45:29.275 --> 45:30.717
But this one, of course, is precious.

45:30.737 --> 45:35.906
But that's one of those examples where I told you the more traveling I did, the more stuff came together.

45:37.208 --> 45:42.557
There was a story from two different places, from Silver and from Doe, about the day that they went over.

45:42.577 --> 45:45.141
And there's more to the story that I'm not telling you.

45:45.492 --> 45:48.657
Did Faulkner give Einstein any books inscribed?

45:48.677 --> 45:48.938
No.

45:48.958 --> 45:52.423
He went over another day and Doe told me how he just sat there silent.

45:52.443 --> 45:54.166
He was absolutely taciturn.

45:54.547 --> 45:55.528
Wouldn't say a word.

45:55.588 --> 45:56.089
Faulkner?

45:56.209 --> 45:56.911
Yeah, Faulkner.

45:57.171 --> 46:01.137
And when they got back to the Cummins house, Doe said, Bill, you were rude.

46:01.238 --> 46:02.720
Why were you so rude to that man?

46:04.002 --> 46:08.209
He said, well, what would I have to say to a man like Albert Einstein?

46:08.229 --> 46:09.171
That was before this.

46:09.751 --> 46:11.775
That was an earlier visit.

46:11.795 --> 46:11.955
But

46:12.543 --> 46:14.125
You know, there were all kinds of interesting stories.

46:14.145 --> 46:15.886
Fartner was real silent, you know that.

46:16.067 --> 46:17.848
He was very uncommunicated.

46:17.868 --> 46:21.752
It would be nice if he inscribed the book and gave it to Albert Einstein.

46:21.772 --> 46:24.735
It would have been, but I don't believe that would have ever happened, no.

46:25.036 --> 46:26.357
It would have surfaced by now soon.

46:26.377 --> 46:27.398
I think Dole would have told me.

46:28.279 --> 46:30.681
And probably it would be in the Princeton collections anyway.

46:30.882 --> 46:32.543
Isn't that where Einstein stuff is?

46:32.623 --> 46:37.388
Oh, I've got a great story to tell you about that, but I don't think I'm going to do it now because I'm running out of energy and steam.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.310
I need to go up and visit Bob.

46:40.133 --> 46:42.436
Let me leave you with one more book and then I won't even do those.

46:42.456 --> 46:43.557
There's a bunch of inscribed.

46:44.258 --> 46:45.679
This we could do the same number on.

46:46.901 --> 46:47.942
Let me stay on it one minute.

46:48.002 --> 46:48.823
Let me show you one thing.

46:48.843 --> 46:51.446
What do you call this little drill that you're doing with these books?

46:51.466 --> 46:51.806
With you?

46:52.467 --> 46:54.109
I haven't done this in so long.

46:54.149 --> 46:55.250
I guess that's why I'm so wired.

46:55.550 --> 46:56.311
You'll have to forgive me.

46:57.372 --> 46:59.134
I don't do this drill.

47:01.076 --> 47:02.818
I haven't touched the books in how long?

47:03.038 --> 47:03.219
A year?

47:04.180 --> 47:05.101
These old friends of mine.

47:05.141 --> 47:07.003
Here's a book, Clean Up Books' copy.

47:07.624 --> 47:08.925
Here's Ruth Ford's copy.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.022
So you haven't touched these books in a year?

47:12.042 --> 47:12.182
Uh-huh.

47:12.202 --> 47:13.243
That's the first time in a year.

47:13.263 --> 47:13.884
Yeah, you got me.

47:14.164 --> 47:15.265
Are you getting a kick out of this?

47:15.746 --> 47:19.930
Well, what do you think?

47:19.950 --> 47:21.172
It's a blow-a-mule.

47:21.192 --> 47:22.573
Yeah, that's a rhetorical.

47:22.593 --> 47:24.215
Blow-a-mule.

47:24.235 --> 47:25.356
Let me show you something.

47:25.716 --> 47:26.657
Put the machines up.

47:26.677 --> 47:29.260
I'll tell you during my trip.

47:29.340 --> 47:36.668
I mean, one of the great pleasures for me is to see these collectors finally get into their collections.

47:36.985 --> 47:38.286
Let me run a number for you here.

47:38.426 --> 47:39.467
Just watch it like this.

47:39.487 --> 47:40.088
It's true.

47:40.388 --> 47:42.911
Memo to Sax Cummins from author to editor.

47:43.511 --> 47:48.536
We never always saw eye to eye, but we were always looking at the same thing.

47:48.656 --> 47:50.198
Yeah, let's, can I hold that?

47:50.258 --> 47:51.619
Sure, but I'm going to give you the one to hold.

47:51.679 --> 47:53.181
It's the most significant one to hold.

47:53.781 --> 47:55.063
You notice I get a kick out of it.

47:55.083 --> 47:55.583
You tell me.

47:55.623 --> 47:58.466
Ask me some of the books I've held around the world in the last year.

47:58.486 --> 48:00.788
Oh, yeah.

48:00.808 --> 48:02.410
Tell me why that one.

48:02.430 --> 48:03.231
This is a kick from me.

48:03.251 --> 48:04.512
That one's a freak out, man.

48:04.711 --> 48:06.312
That one's to the dedicatee.

48:06.673 --> 48:07.434
Oh, my goodness.

48:07.454 --> 48:08.675
Now, what does it say?

48:08.715 --> 48:10.396
To Sachs and Dorothy.

48:10.416 --> 48:11.157
For Sachs, S-A-X-U.

48:11.397 --> 48:12.999
For Sachs and Dorothy with love.

48:13.019 --> 48:15.000
And Dorothy with love, comma, with love.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.362
Bill Faulkner, not dated.

48:17.243 --> 48:18.604
See if it is on the title page.

48:18.984 --> 48:21.086
And then we go to the title page.

48:23.668 --> 48:25.250
And it's William Faulkner.

48:25.850 --> 48:26.771
And what's, where is that?

48:26.791 --> 48:29.634
11 June 1957, Princeton.

48:29.654 --> 48:32.997
Princeton, 11 June 1957.

48:33.449 --> 48:34.450
Is that one or seven?

48:34.610 --> 48:34.831
Seven.

48:34.951 --> 48:35.191
Seven.

48:36.312 --> 48:37.513
Actually, two years after.

48:37.614 --> 48:38.855
Big Woods by William Fawker.

48:40.116 --> 48:43.500
And the dedicatee, we can find it.

48:43.860 --> 48:44.781
Oh, I love it.

48:45.742 --> 48:46.744
I won't put this on the tape.

48:46.784 --> 48:47.665
I'll just write it down.

48:48.245 --> 48:49.446
Memo to Saks.

48:49.887 --> 48:50.928
Memo to colon.

48:50.988 --> 48:51.749
Saks Cummins.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.073
C-O-M-M-I-N-S.

48:55.373 --> 48:56.054
What did I say?

48:56.074 --> 48:56.154
C-U?

48:56.174 --> 48:57.135
No, you didn't say it.

48:57.255 --> 48:58.356
C-O-M-M-I-N-S.

48:58.376 --> 48:58.476
Yeah.

48:58.997 --> 49:02.781
From colon author to colon editor.

49:03.723 --> 49:07.792
We never always saw eye to eye, but we were always looking at the same thing.

49:07.892 --> 49:09.055
Isn't that really just extraordinary?

49:09.075 --> 49:09.536
You know what?

49:09.917 --> 49:12.343
She had the little piece of paper and couldn't find it.

49:12.363 --> 49:16.031
The manuscript for that dedication, and we've never found it.

49:16.532 --> 49:17.595
She had it.

49:17.615 --> 49:19.178
It wasn't in the paper.

49:19.198 --> 49:21.343
Remind me on the way on the drive home to tell you about the story.

49:21.627 --> 49:25.352
about how I resurrected this group from the Firestone Library.

49:26.334 --> 49:28.877
Resurrected or diverted?

49:29.638 --> 49:33.764
How I pulled the rug right out from under the Flintstones Firestone Library.

49:33.784 --> 49:34.986
Because I think they'd like to have it.

49:35.146 --> 49:36.127
I'll tell you.

49:36.167 --> 49:37.269
That was a doozy.

49:37.289 --> 49:39.632
Let me show you a little more run, and then I've got to go up to hell for a minute.

49:39.973 --> 49:40.573
Can I just write?

49:40.594 --> 49:41.014
Yeah, sure.

49:41.294 --> 49:42.877
Actually, I can get this out.

49:42.937 --> 49:43.818
Let me just show you this.

49:44.058 --> 49:48.124
Will I be a compass to any of these things if you're ever charged with it?

49:48.104 --> 49:50.207
I ain't charged with anything unethical.

49:50.227 --> 49:54.312
I just did it a little with a little chicanery, a little good healthy American chicanery.

49:54.352 --> 49:55.754
These are wonderful stories.

49:55.774 --> 49:56.615
That one's to Saks.

49:56.895 --> 49:58.237
How did you get the one from Virginia?

49:58.257 --> 49:58.918
Don't forget that.

49:58.938 --> 49:59.499
Oh, that's nice.

49:59.759 --> 50:00.220
Look at that one.

50:00.260 --> 50:03.184
That's an inscribed copy of Big Woods to Saks and Dorothy.

50:03.604 --> 50:05.326
Here's one to Phil Stone with love.

50:05.587 --> 50:06.768
Phil, inscribed.

50:08.010 --> 50:10.533
Let's keep going a minute.

50:10.553 --> 50:12.276
Here's one to Aunt Bama with love.

50:12.456 --> 50:13.437
William Faulkner.

50:14.598 --> 50:17.002
Who could ever pull out books like this of Falkner?

50:17.062 --> 50:18.864
We're so spoiled here, Bob and I are.

50:19.445 --> 50:21.789
There aren't this many books anywhere in the world like this.

50:22.510 --> 50:23.191
Here's another one.

50:23.231 --> 50:30.422
To Sister, that's who he called his daughter, Victoria, because she was really like a sister to his own daughter, Jill.

50:30.943 --> 50:32.405
She was his stepdaughter, Victoria.

50:32.645 --> 50:34.929
To Sister and her husband, Bill, Bill Fielden.

50:35.189 --> 50:38.374
To Sister and Bill was, well, happy.

50:38.394 --> 50:38.614
All right?

50:38.864 --> 50:43.891
I'm going to let Bob show you some of the manuscripts while I go up the hill.

50:43.911 --> 50:46.655
No, I didn't tell him any of that.

50:46.675 --> 50:48.378
Look at this one.

50:48.398 --> 50:50.761
You'll like that.

50:50.922 --> 50:51.562
You'll like that.

50:51.883 --> 50:53.565
And then I'm going to do you one more and I'm going to leave you.

50:53.585 --> 51:01.337
Malcolm Cowley, this is the copy from which I reviewed Big Woods in the New York Times Sunday Book Review, asterisk, October 16, 1955.

51:04.341 --> 51:06.424
Note the revisions of stories in this book.

51:07.214 --> 51:10.258
Dash, skillful but not always successful, period.

51:10.298 --> 51:15.684
I think he spoiled Delta Autumn cover, the last story in this book, Malcolm Cowley.

51:17.466 --> 51:18.707
Malcolm Cowley, Malcolm Cowley.

51:18.727 --> 51:20.329
He wrote to himself on this.

51:20.349 --> 51:21.290
No, no, he wrote that for me.

51:22.432 --> 51:23.152
I had him right there.

51:23.172 --> 51:23.713
Oh, is that right?

51:23.793 --> 51:25.675
He wrote that.

51:25.695 --> 51:26.937
That's kind of nice.

51:26.957 --> 51:27.858
Oh, you had him do that.

51:28.458 --> 51:29.420
I said I had him do that.

51:29.460 --> 51:30.521
Hold on a minute, I'll tell you.

51:30.541 --> 51:32.043
Yeah, I mean, you sat him down and said, do this.

51:32.383 --> 51:33.244
No, I asked him if he would.

51:33.925 --> 51:34.385
I asked him.

51:34.646 --> 51:35.987
These were his shelf copies.

51:36.608 --> 51:36.748
Mm-hmm.

51:37.083 --> 51:40.808
And the reason I had him do it is he said, I had a bunch of these that were my review copies.

51:40.828 --> 51:41.990
They didn't have their slips in anymore.

51:42.010 --> 51:43.632
He said, I usually threw the slips away.

51:43.692 --> 51:45.875
He only had one or two that had the slips.

51:46.456 --> 51:52.844
I said, on those that were your review copies, and he knew, I said, would you write a note in so that you'll confirm them for the future?

51:53.866 --> 51:56.970
And so he did that on four or five of those.

51:57.571 --> 52:00.715
This may be the last book Buckner inscribed.

52:02.137 --> 52:02.938
The reverse.

52:03.458 --> 52:12.243
We are holding what we believe to be the final book that Faulkner inscribed as the Reavers, William Faulkner, and this is what?

52:12.263 --> 52:12.805
Is that Oxford?

52:12.905 --> 52:16.776
Oxford, Mississippi, 12 June 1962.

52:17.178 --> 52:18.719
He died three weeks later.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.241
He died three weeks later.

52:20.581 --> 52:21.762
And this is to Stone.

52:21.823 --> 52:23.484
And this is to Emily and Stowe from Bill.

52:23.724 --> 52:29.490
And the story here is that Faulkner over the years faithfully inscribed a book to Phil Stone.

52:29.570 --> 52:32.793
Every time a new title would come out, he would take the copy to Stone.

52:33.314 --> 52:41.141
But in the last years of Faulkner's life, Stone would not speak to Faulkner because they had had serious disagreements over the race question.

52:41.161 --> 52:47.067
And the story was when Faulkner would take his new book to Phil Stone's law office, as he did this one to deliver it to his friend,

52:47.350 --> 52:59.386
And when Faulkner would walk in the front door, Phil Stone would walk out the back because Phil wouldn't have any... As we know from the letters in this collection, Stone was a racist and he disagreed strongly with Faulkner's stand on immigration.

52:59.506 --> 53:01.028
But he still accepted the inscribed books.

53:01.048 --> 53:01.509
That's right.

53:01.529 --> 53:04.012
And Faulkner would leave the books with the secretary, leave them there.

53:04.052 --> 53:06.916
And this may be the last one that he inscribed.

53:07.938 --> 53:15.548
So there's a rather poignant... The inscriptions that I like are those that have the stories behind them, particularly with Stone.

53:15.708 --> 53:17.070
Mosquitoes.

53:17.759 --> 53:19.381
That's the book I spoke to you of.

53:20.121 --> 53:23.104
Bob, these go off the bar.

53:23.124 --> 53:23.384
Oh, wow.

53:24.105 --> 53:25.206
This is extraordinary.

53:26.567 --> 53:28.309
This is a pretty long inscription.

53:28.329 --> 53:31.372
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

53:32.072 --> 53:34.775
That's about as long an inscription as you're going to find from Flockler.

53:34.875 --> 53:36.497
Oh, absolutely.

53:36.517 --> 53:36.917
Eight lines.

53:38.158 --> 53:39.639
To my... I can't read it.

53:41.361 --> 53:41.862
To Tony?

53:42.362 --> 53:42.562
Yeah.

53:43.543 --> 53:43.983
Know what it says?

53:44.564 --> 53:45.165
To Tony.

53:46.526 --> 53:46.686
To Tony.

53:49.349 --> 53:51.712
I guess.

53:51.732 --> 53:52.152
I'll show you.

53:52.172 --> 53:53.574
I heard they something.

53:54.194 --> 53:56.016
Well, Faulkner's real hard to read.

53:56.577 --> 54:02.564
Says to Tony, who can't remember, and neither could he.

54:03.485 --> 54:14.637
Because if you check this against the published version of the needleboats at San Sabah, you'll find, but what you can see here from the appearance of the hand, which isn't so neat, he was drunk on his ass when he did this.

54:14.677 --> 54:16.379
And they were both reciting poetry.

54:16.399 --> 54:17.761
They both obviously love poetry.

54:17.821 --> 54:19.002
Can you try and read a little bit of it?

54:19.555 --> 54:22.499
This is the inscribed muskios.

54:22.519 --> 54:25.222
Why don't you let me get the... Okay, never mind, don't bother.

54:25.242 --> 54:26.364
Who did he inscribe it to?

54:26.384 --> 54:34.073
He inscribed it to Tony Boutita, who was the editor of Contempo, a magazine that published Faulkner.

54:37.278 --> 54:37.378
Okay.

54:37.398 --> 54:39.921
But it's a poem, is what it is, to Tony, who can't remember.

54:39.981 --> 54:41.563
But the wonderful, funny thing about it...

54:41.915 --> 54:47.962
As I said, is they were trying to banter it back and forth and none of them could verbalize it.

54:47.982 --> 54:48.903
We have another time.

54:48.943 --> 54:51.426
That's the item you brought from Carl's collection.

54:51.446 --> 54:51.806
That's right.

54:52.007 --> 55:01.958
We have, if you find, and you might in that pass, it's in a long folder, that series that we, do you remember the letter we had?

55:02.218 --> 55:10.808
Any man who could have paid 55 grand for the living guts was an idiot to pass up mosquitoes for 23.

55:12.475 --> 55:14.177
Bob will go on, I'll be back.

55:14.197 --> 55:14.537
Okay.

55:16.299 --> 55:16.700
Probably here.

55:17.401 --> 55:19.323
I'll be back.

55:19.343 --> 55:25.070
We were talking about Carl's, Bob and I were talking about Carl Peterson's inscription to L.D.

55:25.570 --> 55:30.276
It was for L.D., who's Faulkner collecting knows no slack season, Carl.

55:30.316 --> 55:32.438
And you said there's a play on slack there.

55:32.458 --> 55:35.342
Yeah, when Carl wrote this for L.D., L.D.

55:35.402 --> 55:40.828
was working for his father's clothing company.

55:41.078 --> 55:47.730
business and was working outlet stores, stocking outlet stores with slacks and jackets.

55:48.131 --> 55:48.592
That's cute.

55:48.612 --> 55:49.854
So there was a play on the word there.

55:50.075 --> 55:50.275
Yeah.

55:51.778 --> 55:57.589
Okay, I'm just... I guess I should try and find a copy of that book.

55:57.990 --> 56:01.416
I'm going to shut this off and start a new tape because this is just about over.
