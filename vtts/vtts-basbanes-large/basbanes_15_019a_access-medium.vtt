WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:03.112
talking to E.L.

00:03.132 --> 00:04.073
Doctorow.

00:05.816 --> 00:26.106
I think, to start, and that'll pick up, that really I wouldn't even need to do this interview about this book, because I think what you tell us is in two essays in this book, 19th Century and False Documents, and I suspect that the first one, which was written in 92, and the second one in 91,

00:27.487 --> 00:30.050
This book was percolating.

00:30.370 --> 00:32.493
Let's start with that.

00:32.693 --> 00:34.315
Well, you mean the essay book.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.697
This essay book.

00:35.737 --> 00:37.779
But it tells me about this book, I think.

00:37.799 --> 00:38.179
I see.

00:38.400 --> 00:48.532
I'll tell you the background of this.

00:48.552 --> 00:55.840
I've been writing pieces, usually reluctantly, for many years.

00:56.258 --> 00:59.423
I didn't realize there was enough for a book there.

00:59.743 --> 01:03.669
But I didn't just want to write, put together a collection.

01:03.709 --> 01:13.263
I was very selective in what I chose, and I tried to have the book make sense as a book.

01:13.283 --> 01:20.173
The original title was going to be Poets and Presidents, which describes the orc that it covers.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.883
But I was persuaded to put this title on.

01:23.923 --> 01:27.849
It's just been published in England, and it's titled Poets and Press.

01:27.949 --> 01:32.015
So why did you change, pardon me for interrupting?

01:35.079 --> 01:50.582
My publishers and everyone around who's read the book thinking about it saw this title as a way to attract readers who

01:51.271 --> 01:55.116
might not otherwise pick up a book of essays.

01:56.358 --> 01:58.821
And I went along with that judgment.

01:58.841 --> 02:03.707
And I do use the phrase, Poets in Presence, in the introductions.

02:03.827 --> 02:08.493
That was my accommodation to the publisher.

02:09.775 --> 02:15.742
The two pieces you mentioned, False Documents, was written in 1977, I think.

02:15.983 --> 02:17.304
It's got a 91-day on it.

02:17.425 --> 02:19.287
Oh, possibly.

02:20.245 --> 02:20.966
Go ahead.

02:20.986 --> 02:26.453
The other piece, the 19th New York.

02:26.473 --> 02:30.759
The 19th New York.

02:30.779 --> 02:30.919
Right.

02:30.939 --> 02:32.181
First published in 1977.

02:32.201 --> 02:42.134
But see, it says... I'm sorry, you just... Oh, I looked at the wrong one.

02:42.155 --> 02:43.076
I looked at the wrong one.

02:43.196 --> 02:43.496
Yeah.

02:43.536 --> 02:44.197
Wait a second.

02:44.217 --> 02:45.098
They made a mistake.

02:45.479 --> 02:46.160
I think they did.

02:46.841 --> 02:46.941
Yeah.

02:48.143 --> 02:49.965
Because here... Oh, that's James Wright.

02:53.185 --> 02:53.586
1991.

02:53.666 --> 02:59.133
I'm sorry, sir.

02:59.514 --> 03:00.054
You can talk.

03:00.074 --> 03:04.300
I'm just looking at the standards.

03:04.320 --> 03:04.761
It's 77.

03:04.781 --> 03:06.203
I looked at the wrong one.

03:06.223 --> 03:06.944
Okay, great.

03:06.964 --> 03:10.969
Now that makes more sense.

03:10.989 --> 03:20.442
A piece I originally wrote because I was so astonished at some of the reaction to ragtime, that

03:21.451 --> 03:26.960
As if no one had ever used historical materials in a novel before.

03:28.702 --> 03:37.195
I mean, I grew up reading Dumas and Victor Hugo in Tolstoy.

03:37.256 --> 03:44.607
Dumas has Cardinal Richelieu as a character.

03:45.329 --> 03:57.180
Victor Hugo has the Napoleonic campaign in Russia, and he has generals.

03:58.821 --> 04:06.769
So that was the impetus for that book and the thesis of the false document.

04:08.490 --> 04:13.615
Now, the 19th New York, if you took

04:13.831 --> 04:21.062
If you wanted to bother to take the trouble, you'll see that I actually lifted whole paragraphs from the novel.

04:21.563 --> 04:23.546
And that's really how this question started.

04:23.566 --> 04:26.290
That is the print and essay for this novel.

04:26.851 --> 04:41.374
During the course of writing the novel, an editor at Architectural Digest called me, and he'd been trying to get me to write an annual New York issue.

04:42.434 --> 04:44.997
And I'd always turn him down.

04:45.018 --> 04:52.628
And here I was writing this book about New York in which the city really almost figures as a character.

04:53.469 --> 04:57.054
It's the first question I have here.

04:57.314 --> 04:59.177
It's almost like a vanity fair.

04:59.417 --> 05:01.280
It is a novel of the city.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.062
Yeah, without question.

05:03.242 --> 05:05.886
And when I realized that, and he said, how about it this year?

05:06.507 --> 05:07.308
I said, okay.

05:08.409 --> 05:08.830
And I...

05:09.755 --> 05:19.984
pretending the voice was non-fictive, I lifted McElvain's observations and gave them to myself.

05:20.064 --> 05:28.071
And, you know, then they put a picture of the, quote, holding a resume on the 46th century.

05:28.091 --> 05:30.533
And there was the essay about New York in the 19th century.

05:30.913 --> 05:38.580
What I was actually describing around that was how I'd begun to perceive the city as a result of writing this book.

05:39.033 --> 05:42.878
I saw how much of the 19th century was still visible.

05:43.098 --> 05:53.371
And I originally described in that essay this uncanny thing that happened when I was... I have an office window.

05:53.391 --> 05:57.636
I don't know whether you were up there.

05:57.656 --> 06:02.202
It looks south of Manhattan from about nine or ten stories up.

06:02.222 --> 06:03.383
And where is the building?

06:03.403 --> 06:07.909
It overlooks Houston Street, Soho.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.489
And this enormous farm came in.

06:10.509 --> 06:24.569
It first covered the World Trade Center, and then it covered all the 1960s steel and glass buildings, and then it covered the 1920s Woolworth Building, and soon it covered the entire 20th century.

06:24.589 --> 06:28.134
It was gone, and there was the 19th century.

06:28.374 --> 06:29.335
It was left.

06:29.375 --> 06:30.978
It was a ground-level city.

06:30.998 --> 06:33.862
It was never more than six or eight stories high.

06:33.882 --> 06:35.584
The tallest things were church buildings.

06:36.357 --> 06:48.756
towers, and I went outside, and I was walking down green streets through the iron fronts, and this was Melville City, this was Poe City, it was Whitman City.

06:49.777 --> 07:00.773
So I gave that to the, without describing it personally, that perception to the Architectural Digest piece.

07:00.793 --> 07:05.841
And then I put it in there as a kind of

07:06.648 --> 07:16.802
It's probably the one piece that is least justifiable in terms of the arc of the book and relationship among the pieces.

07:16.822 --> 07:28.639
But I like the idea of having something predictive of the novel, something that would, if anyone cared, they would see that I've been thinking about this in

07:29.193 --> 07:32.638
The novel was almost predicted by the tone of the piece.

07:33.018 --> 07:38.566
It certainly resonated with me, because this book of essays came out about seven or eight months ago.

07:38.787 --> 07:41.951
And reading the book, I said, geez, there's a piece.

07:41.971 --> 07:46.938
And I went back to this this morning just to refresh myself, because it really did.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.302
Well, that was good.

07:49.322 --> 07:50.564
That was observant of you.

07:50.764 --> 07:54.609
But in fact, the novel was there before the piece was there.

07:54.629 --> 07:55.791
I understand, but they certainly...

07:56.176 --> 08:25.153
we're talking about a synergistic kind of a thing here whichever is feeding off the other I don't know but I think it certainly does express what you were doing at that time it certainly expresses my you know when you when you write it's a sort of continuous act of concentration that doesn't let up it almost becomes obsessive when you're doing a book

08:25.336 --> 08:27.679
And it's such a single-minded thing.

08:28.960 --> 08:33.026
And everyone else who was around me was living in the 20th century.

08:33.066 --> 08:39.113
I was living in the 19th for the couple of years or two and a half years I was writing this book.

08:39.193 --> 08:46.923
And all my perceptions were controlled by that.

08:46.943 --> 08:51.208
So it was very easy to knock together that piece.

08:52.437 --> 09:02.808
I'm not meaning to mention another critic, but Christopher Leeuwenhoff points out quite as duly that this novel springs from one of the stories in life.

09:02.909 --> 09:03.790
Yes, that's true.

09:07.033 --> 09:15.442
I mentioned that in an interview.

09:15.603 --> 09:17.505
I forget where.

09:17.525 --> 09:20.588
But in the Lives of the Poets,

09:21.665 --> 09:24.768
There's a little two or three page dream story called The Water Works.

09:25.389 --> 09:32.917
And that's the real beginning of the book, and the beginning of everything having to do with the 19th century.

09:33.958 --> 09:36.300
I couldn't get that story out of my mind.

09:36.321 --> 09:41.566
And I think about it, and then I went off and I wrote World's Fair.

09:42.948 --> 09:48.714
And then I came sort of thinking about it again, and then I went off and I wrote Billy Bathgate.

09:48.734 --> 09:50.035
Then I came back to it.

09:50.808 --> 09:51.829
And it was time.

09:52.851 --> 09:57.296
What I realized from those images, because there's nothing specific in that story.

09:57.316 --> 09:58.698
There's no specific city.

09:58.778 --> 10:00.200
There's no specific time.

10:01.101 --> 10:11.593
I realized it had to be the 19th century because waterworks were the technological achievement of the 19th century image.

10:12.074 --> 10:16.359
That's when they learned how to bring water to the city, put it under pressure.

10:16.379 --> 10:19.363
That's when the fire departments were organized.

10:19.613 --> 10:23.417
That's when they could fight fire with hoses rather than buckets.

10:24.719 --> 10:34.289
And New York City, having been a very combustible town, used to burn all the time, just as McElvain describes.

10:34.309 --> 10:35.510
It was incredible, awful.

10:35.951 --> 10:37.853
Big fires, little fires.

10:38.573 --> 10:44.160
Once they got the Croton Holding Reservoir in there, things were stabilized.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.482
But the point is, so I had

10:47.575 --> 10:56.285
I had my century, and then I remembered the Croton-Holding Reservoir in the middle of where the public library now stands.

10:56.526 --> 11:02.252
So I had New York, and in the story there were these two guys.

11:02.393 --> 11:10.682
One is the Observer, and the other is the strange bearded man, who wraps up the body of the child and runs off with it.

11:10.742 --> 11:16.249
So that turned out to be Sartorius, and the Observer turned out to be McElvain.

11:16.685 --> 11:29.482
The whole book is, in a sense, a deduction process of deducing the meaning and the implications and the evocative feelings that I had of writing that little dream.

11:29.502 --> 11:36.471
See, it really does veer on the difference between the story and the novel.

11:36.571 --> 11:41.157
I mean, maybe you wrote that little story and you weren't satisfied.

11:41.508 --> 11:43.791
of completion, I guess.

11:43.811 --> 11:46.975
No, absolutely not, or I wouldn't have been thinking about it so constantly.

11:47.656 --> 11:50.980
Or I knew that it was terribly evocative.

11:51.280 --> 12:05.338
And yet those stories and lives of the poets were, in a sense, related, certainly thematically, and they could have stood as a finished work, couldn't it?

12:05.740 --> 12:07.623
But you still had to take it.

12:07.663 --> 12:08.484
But you never know.

12:09.145 --> 12:15.133
You know, all the books began with some, the smallest thing for me.

12:15.814 --> 12:21.983
Even The Sound of Words, like Loon Lake, was what got that book going.

12:22.003 --> 12:26.990
That's when I saw the sign on the road that said Loon Lake and up the Adirondack.

12:27.010 --> 12:29.554
It's always an image or a picture.

12:31.795 --> 12:35.220
anticipating my questions, because it starts with an image.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.202
Yeah, rephrase.

12:36.262 --> 12:37.163
For me, it does.

12:37.223 --> 12:51.625
This book started with the images of that little boat sinking the reservoir, and then they find the boat's owner, as he says, also a miniature, drowned in the warworks.

12:51.785 --> 12:53.087
That's how the book began.

12:53.628 --> 12:57.053
Billy Bathgate began with the image of these guys in tuxedos.

12:57.814 --> 13:00.638
What was that about?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.424
to have the kid hop on the boat.

13:03.444 --> 13:05.549
He was going to find out for me, you see.

13:06.731 --> 13:09.116
So that's always the beginning.

13:09.416 --> 13:23.183
And what was momentous is that sort of this, when you realize this little private excitement you have, this mysterious

13:26.150 --> 13:36.243
I don't dare call it a state of arousal, but it's an excitement, and you realize there's a book there.

13:36.263 --> 13:37.565
It'll keep going.

13:39.708 --> 13:43.452
And so I start to write.

13:43.512 --> 13:48.138
The next step was to have his voice, to have McElwain's voice.

13:48.158 --> 13:52.865
None of these books can get written without somebody.

13:52.885 --> 13:54.807
I always need an airing.

13:55.192 --> 14:13.396
Well, I think it was just a stroke of genius to have this newspaper man, a naturally inquisitive and a trained investigator, what we call an investigator today, but in a position here, actually, to end the wherewithal to go on and to follow this.

14:13.536 --> 14:17.321
It's interesting, because... And he's very observant, too.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.644
We picked up his images of the city.

14:19.884 --> 14:20.966
Yeah.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.768
It's a story he didn't write.

14:23.542 --> 14:31.393
And now he's thinking back in his old age, maybe 30, 35 years later.

14:33.436 --> 14:39.025
I imagined him as talking to someone.

14:39.786 --> 14:46.956
There's nothing the reader has to worry about, but I wanted to know in my mind who he was talking to.

14:47.357 --> 14:49.600
And I decided he was talking to a stenographer.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.014
I was about to say a tape recorder before it's invented.

14:53.495 --> 14:55.017
I'll get to this.

14:55.498 --> 14:57.021
Trust me, this is important.

14:58.183 --> 15:06.696
He's talking to a stenographer who's obviously younger, necessarily younger, with these asides, and he's thinking about his words.

15:07.057 --> 15:09.801
It's very important to him that he be understood.

15:12.706 --> 15:15.891
So that was what I kept in my mind.

15:17.390 --> 15:39.802
When Conrad has Marlow talking endlessly, he always sets it up at the beginning with another voice that says, we were all sitting on the afterdeck of the ship, and we lit our scars, and we were drinking brandy, and the sun was going down over the Thames, and Marlow said, blah, blah, blah, and Marlow is off on his tail.

15:41.424 --> 15:45.810
Well, I just thought, I wonder if I should frame it up this way.

15:46.803 --> 15:49.847
And then I decided, well, you don't have to do that anymore.

15:49.867 --> 15:50.848
It's understood.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.731
A contemporary reader understands.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.877
I don't know.

15:56.897 --> 16:05.088
This is the ancient mariner kind of guy talking.

16:05.108 --> 16:06.349
That kind of situation.

16:06.389 --> 16:13.519
But McElvain, the only clue he gives, he says, you people today, you have your

16:14.275 --> 16:19.621
And you think we were colorful and quaint.

16:20.642 --> 16:21.463
But we weren't.

16:21.483 --> 16:23.666
We were deadly.

16:24.667 --> 16:30.533
And we did not conduct ourselves as if we were preparatory to your time.

16:30.934 --> 16:42.527
So that's the only hint I give that he's speaking probably around the turn of the century, when automobiles were motorcars and

16:42.828 --> 16:47.013
And lights were electric lights.

16:47.033 --> 16:50.918
I had to pause on that, as a matter of fact, and try and get the timing.

16:51.699 --> 16:53.681
I remember that passage precisely.

16:54.702 --> 16:57.265
I wonder, when the heck is he telling this thing now?

16:57.445 --> 16:59.568
Well, we don't say telephones anymore.

16:59.588 --> 17:00.349
We say phones.

17:00.369 --> 17:01.390
That's right.

17:01.510 --> 17:05.535
I remember that point where I actually had to figure it out, and I guess I came to that.

17:05.735 --> 17:12.143
Well, that's the only sort of kind of

17:13.135 --> 17:17.179
But it's necessary.

17:17.199 --> 17:20.543
To the narrator.

17:20.803 --> 17:28.511
And again, we're not going to get into the story too much, because it does speak for itself, and I don't want to give anything to it.

17:28.531 --> 17:28.871
I love it.

17:29.512 --> 17:33.075
The jacket art, normally we don't talk about jacket art.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.299
Now is this your idea, or did the artists come up with this?

17:37.320 --> 17:41.404
I thought maybe there should be a logo based on the

17:42.262 --> 17:45.246
the omnibus with the old man in it.

17:45.366 --> 17:50.132
But on the surface, if you know nothing about the novel, it's a charming picture of old New York.

17:50.152 --> 17:50.693
Yeah.

17:50.713 --> 17:51.394
Without knowing.

17:51.434 --> 17:52.935
Yeah.

17:55.058 --> 18:01.366
Well, I probably would have liked a dark or gloomier jacket.

18:03.229 --> 18:05.832
But I thought this was striking.

18:05.852 --> 18:05.992
Yeah.

18:06.773 --> 18:08.836
And you can see it from a distance.

18:08.876 --> 18:09.957
It's very important.

18:11.523 --> 18:19.375
I noticed they did, and this hasn't happened to me before, they sent a review copy of the Large Type Edition.

18:19.415 --> 18:20.857
Have you seen that yet?

18:20.877 --> 18:21.919
Yeah, I've seen it.

18:21.939 --> 18:25.745
That's pretty interesting that they did this simultaneous with that.

18:26.085 --> 18:29.831
Yeah, these are all new things that happened.

18:31.013 --> 18:40.467
They also simultaneously released an audio tape of an abridged version of the book read by Sam Waterston.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.563
So they have the tape and the large print.

18:45.806 --> 18:53.036
You mentioned earlier that you consider the city something of a character.

18:53.456 --> 19:04.992
Is the city also a metaphor for you, the 19th century New York City, a metaphor for you?

19:05.012 --> 19:10.639
We do have this closing image of the ghost city, and yet it's going to be the same.

19:10.990 --> 19:31.996
I mean, it's even true of historians.

19:34.900 --> 19:40.947
You're always writing to your own needs and the needs of the present somehow.

19:41.163 --> 19:57.837
Beyond that, I wouldn't go to say that there was any conscious intention that I wanted the readers to draw a moral or anything that specific.

19:59.779 --> 20:03.022
This question was asked about Billy Bathgate, too.

20:03.943 --> 20:06.905
Writing about banksters, anything, did you mean to say anything about that?

20:07.746 --> 20:09.988
Well, all I could say honestly was that

20:10.559 --> 20:13.142
At any given time, there's a book you can write.

20:14.163 --> 20:18.869
See, it's not for me endless possibilities.

20:19.830 --> 20:22.574
Every time I say, well, what shall I do?

20:23.335 --> 20:29.282
I always land on the only book I can write at that time.

20:30.123 --> 20:39.655
In the 1980s under Reagan, that was the only book I could write about a kid who's in love with criminals.

20:40.377 --> 20:50.467
But I never modeled it as an allegory of the 1980s, similarly with this.

20:50.487 --> 20:59.236
This story was stuck in my mind, and suddenly it became possible for me to think clearly about it and advance my thought about it.

20:59.936 --> 21:00.957
Now, why?

21:01.458 --> 21:01.978
I don't know.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.823
But there must be some relationship between

21:08.373 --> 21:15.159
what I feel about now, any now, and the book I find it possible to write.

21:16.921 --> 21:23.967
But more than that, I don't want to say, because you don't think about these things.

21:24.067 --> 21:24.848
You're in the book.

21:24.888 --> 21:25.809
You're in the images.

21:25.829 --> 21:27.150
You're in the sentences.

21:27.190 --> 21:28.171
You're living there.

21:29.352 --> 21:37.840
And nothing extraneous can get in, because what it does, first of all, it's so powerful.

21:38.225 --> 22:06.645
it's so magnetic this kind of thing that there's no nothing else exists you there because it is a mystery do you have this thing pretty well figured out going along or does it unravel for you exactly what happened the book is describes a process of discovery

22:07.503 --> 22:12.929
which is roughly akin to my discoveries as I kept going.

22:17.495 --> 22:22.641
I never want to know in advance what's going to happen.

22:22.661 --> 22:26.806
Somewhere along the line, I began to perceive an ending.

22:27.967 --> 22:35.336
And I knew eventually that Sartorius was behind all of this.

22:35.356 --> 22:37.138
But it wasn't just Sartorius.

22:37.844 --> 22:40.507
I will not say that in my opinion.

22:40.527 --> 22:51.781
But at one point, Harry Evans of Random House said, I love Sartorius's title, Dr. Sartorius.

22:51.801 --> 22:53.663
And I thought about that for a couple of days.

22:53.683 --> 22:58.529
I said, no, I can't do that because it's about more than that.

22:59.370 --> 23:01.553
McElvain's discovering more than that.

23:04.757 --> 23:06.619
But it does.

23:06.953 --> 23:10.317
Any book is a deductive process.

23:10.337 --> 23:17.646
At a certain point, you begin to understand what your ending has to be.

23:17.666 --> 23:21.311
You understand what your premises are that you have to deliver on.

23:22.532 --> 23:32.404
But it exactly duplicates the reader's mystification.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.890
Is the process a joy for you, or is it a pain in the butt?

23:37.910 --> 23:38.570
Is it hard?

23:39.912 --> 23:40.593
It's hard.

23:40.693 --> 23:41.654
They're all hard.

23:41.814 --> 23:43.095
They're all very hard.

23:43.996 --> 23:53.346
But you also described that moment where you're looking out the window, and the frog does this magical thing to you.

23:54.687 --> 23:59.472
Well, those are the great moments, but when you realize you've got the book,

23:59.857 --> 24:03.781
you realize this is a book and I can do it.

24:05.122 --> 24:10.308
And then when it's finished, you're very happy for a while and you get very sad.

24:10.728 --> 24:17.135
In the middle, you have moments of great elation and I'll describe one of them to you.

24:17.235 --> 24:28.446
But it's also very hard work and there are days when you have doubts and you throw out stuff you thought was good.

24:29.422 --> 24:31.646
You physically throw stuff out?

24:31.666 --> 24:32.147
Oh, yeah.

24:33.128 --> 24:33.970
Lottery vision.

24:34.010 --> 24:37.135
I've always been... You've got to keep those variants.

24:37.155 --> 24:39.158
Well, I don't know.

24:39.539 --> 24:45.950
I mean, the stacks and stacks of rejects on all the books.

24:46.350 --> 24:49.876
I mean, I don't know where my wife despairs of all this.

24:50.818 --> 24:52.721
Because I never throw anything out.

24:52.761 --> 24:53.202
Oh, great.

24:53.620 --> 24:59.546
Every manuscript page has at least six or eight or ten pages I've thrown away.

25:00.366 --> 25:00.987
How do you write?

25:01.007 --> 25:02.248
Did you write in longhand?

25:02.368 --> 25:07.814
No, I've been writing the last few books on a computer.

25:07.834 --> 25:13.259
But I'm sure that you do revisions on hard copy, though.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.040
Absolutely.

25:14.060 --> 25:21.687
The only way to do it— You know, there have been studies—I'm pointing to MIT— there have been studies which indicate that

25:22.696 --> 25:27.961
The reaction to a text on a screen is different from the text on a page.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.242
Without question.

25:30.223 --> 25:35.047
I didn't know that from any study, but I could sense it.

25:36.469 --> 25:40.693
The first thing I did, I was not trusting these newfangled things.

25:41.773 --> 25:52.163
At the end of a work session, I always print things out, and then being unable to stop, I start to read what's on the page and see immediately

25:52.936 --> 25:56.400
what has to be done to do my work on the page.

25:56.580 --> 25:59.464
And so I got into that habit.

25:59.484 --> 26:02.948
And I don't trust words that aren't on a page.

26:02.968 --> 26:05.230
I like to see black print on white paper.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.314
It's the way I've always worked.

26:08.414 --> 26:10.096
Actually, I think it's even different.

26:10.637 --> 26:14.221
Something looks different, reads different in print than it does.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.563
Without question.

26:15.583 --> 26:22.791
I made a lot of small corrections on the galleys.

26:22.990 --> 26:35.382
They were always in such a hurry to publish my books with such a short lead time that I've learned to deal with the production people.

26:36.082 --> 26:38.725
They have what they call the first pass.

26:38.745 --> 26:41.508
That's what they usually bind and send to reviewers.

26:41.648 --> 26:44.671
I said, give me the first pass.

26:44.691 --> 26:45.692
Do not bind it.

26:46.532 --> 26:51.377
I will give them back to you very quickly.

26:52.268 --> 27:01.758
I make my corrections, and what goes out is the corrected—is the second pass, is what gets bound, you see?

27:01.919 --> 27:07.164
And then I have time to do the fine stuff later.

27:08.266 --> 27:09.968
I have this, I think.

27:10.008 --> 27:18.137
They did a set of the proofs for the reviewers with a little blue kind of a—and that's actually the version that I read the novel.

27:18.157 --> 27:19.498
Yeah, that's the second pass.

27:19.578 --> 27:20.419
That's okay.

27:20.973 --> 27:33.309
But it's inconceivable to me that everyone else would see it in print at the same time I was with seeing all these things new, as you described.

27:34.030 --> 27:47.508
The author must have that however brief a time to see what the book looks like in print and make his adjustments before anybody else sees it.

27:47.528 --> 27:49.951
And you see, you're a veteran of the industry.

27:49.971 --> 27:50.912
I mean, yeah.

27:51.550 --> 27:52.931
So you know how to deal with this.

27:54.012 --> 27:59.958
How many writers today are savvy enough that are afforded this kind of a privilege, I wonder?

28:00.118 --> 28:00.919
Well, I don't know.

28:00.959 --> 28:04.762
Maybe some are more organized and doomed.

28:05.903 --> 28:11.949
But I've always felt that a book in print is different from a book in type, without question.

28:12.529 --> 28:13.490
I know of my book.

28:13.870 --> 28:18.114
I've had the luxury now, because it took us a couple months to sell it.

28:19.195 --> 28:21.017
I didn't look at it for six months.

28:21.537 --> 28:28.864
And I find now that I'm just able to change things or to let things go.

28:28.884 --> 28:31.746
I mean, it's not like an amputation now.

28:31.786 --> 28:34.969
I'm just kind of removed from it.

28:35.029 --> 28:40.674
I really think that the separation over a period of time, do you find that from the text?

28:41.315 --> 28:49.722
Never mind from the written text, not necessarily the way it appears in galleys, but do you find that you need a little separation from it?

28:49.904 --> 28:53.328
If you can, I don't have that leisure usually.

28:53.348 --> 28:59.815
It's a continuous process from the minute I hand in the book.

28:59.835 --> 29:06.782
But I think working as an editor for nine or ten years gave me a certain discipline.

29:07.263 --> 29:10.146
That's a good quote.

29:10.166 --> 29:19.776
The ability to look at my own work as objectively as I used to look at other people's work counts for an awful lot, I think, for me.

29:20.228 --> 29:26.096
It taught me to be absolutely objective, clear-headed.

29:26.116 --> 29:40.436
I read 50 pages of the book I'm writing on, and there's a complete separation between the editor and the writer.

29:41.317 --> 29:44.181
So you're your own reader of First Resort then?

29:44.201 --> 29:48.126
Yeah, I always have that.

29:48.848 --> 29:58.551
But I have a very good editor, Jason Epstein, whose intentions to my manuscript are really valued.

29:58.571 --> 30:04.545
He's extremely astute, thoughtful.

30:06.533 --> 30:13.004
Is there a colloquy on the book, or does he, I mean, is there a conversation about the book?

30:13.024 --> 30:13.785
Oh, sure.

30:13.845 --> 30:15.948
About the work in progress, should I say.

30:16.049 --> 30:32.676
Yeah, he made some very good, insightful points that I incorporated into it.

30:33.517 --> 30:39.746
You know, we've been associates since 1976.

30:42.570 --> 30:44.613
That's longer than most marriages, I know.

30:44.633 --> 30:44.893
Sure.

30:44.913 --> 30:47.737
19 years.

30:47.757 --> 30:52.423
Today happens to be my 19th wedding anniversary today, June 15th.

30:52.904 --> 30:53.705
Congratulations.

30:53.725 --> 30:55.548
Thanks for whatever you're talking about.

30:55.568 --> 31:00.655
I hope you're going out to dinner or doing something special.

31:02.069 --> 31:28.161
i got my daughter with me here i keep seeing she's walking around out there and uh no actually a little bottle of champagne or something yeah that's it but anyway it's funny you just mentioned 19 years as a marriage it has happened today you know uh i don't know how much we have i think we've got plenty of good stuff here and of course we have the book and i don't want to take up too much i just want to take a

31:28.765 --> 31:31.748
I never use them yet.

31:31.868 --> 31:32.929
You write them down.

31:35.432 --> 31:57.355
Are you working on something new now, might we ask?

31:58.297 --> 32:16.893
I'll hole up in Sag Harbor for the summer and see what happens after a few of these prime excitements up there in the brain and see what happens.

32:19.215 --> 32:24.360
I would like to ask about your take on the city, I mean the factual stuff.

32:24.700 --> 32:27.122
Did you have to do a lot of research on this?

32:27.389 --> 32:40.602
I did research in the state of medicine in the 19th century.

32:40.622 --> 32:41.923
I did tend to that.

32:42.944 --> 32:49.151
Also, I got very interested in the newspaper business in the 19th century.

32:49.951 --> 32:52.053
It was extremely exciting.

32:52.554 --> 32:56.738
The whole modern newspaper was made possible by the

32:57.393 --> 33:12.899
They were incredibly fast, and suddenly they could distribute papers on the streets for a few pennies for thousands and thousands of copies.

33:12.919 --> 33:15.283
And there were a lot of papers in town.

33:15.364 --> 33:22.135
They were all very competitive from the very beginning.

33:23.836 --> 33:36.397
The first attempt to get scoops from overseas was to send newsboats out to meet the arriving ships while they were still out coming into the harbor.

33:36.417 --> 33:43.870
So newsboats were funny, and then James Gordon Bennett of the Herald

33:44.626 --> 33:47.889
He bought his own boat, you know, and it was fast.

33:47.949 --> 33:49.310
That's famous, yeah.

33:49.891 --> 33:58.378
So from the very beginning, what we think of as a sort of spirit of competitive journalism was rampant in the city.

34:00.160 --> 34:06.566
But you asked before about high moments in the process of writing the book.

34:06.586 --> 34:13.772
One of those came when I was looking on microfilm at front pages of various papers in that period.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.440
And of course, they never had pictures.

34:18.460 --> 34:25.890
Only rarely was there a drawing of steel-pointing grainings, and it was too slow and too expensive.

34:25.910 --> 34:28.754
So it was all words, and there were no banner heads.

34:29.936 --> 34:33.180
There was never a headline that went across two columns, let alone the whole page.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.281
Oh, one column head.

34:34.462 --> 34:36.825
It was all one column head and several subheads.

34:37.245 --> 34:38.427
It was a major story.

34:38.467 --> 34:42.773
When it got to the bottom of the column, it continued to the next column.

34:42.793 --> 34:43.894
So I had this...

34:44.212 --> 34:50.040
I saw these pages of these descending columns, and there's seven of them.

34:50.060 --> 34:51.081
That was the style.

34:52.303 --> 35:10.346
And McElvain was able to use that as his metaphor for uncovering apparently separate stories going along together down the page, but which were, in fact, the same story.

35:10.366 --> 35:11.187
Isn't that great?

35:11.207 --> 35:11.888
Yes.

35:11.948 --> 35:13.290
When I came on that...

35:14.047 --> 35:17.452
I was so happy.

35:17.732 --> 35:20.736
It was such a happy day of work.

35:22.359 --> 35:24.582
So I don't know if that's research, you know?

35:24.602 --> 35:25.563
Is that research?

35:25.763 --> 35:26.945
I don't know.

35:26.965 --> 35:28.066
Perception, maybe.

35:28.086 --> 35:28.727
Perception.

35:28.928 --> 35:33.033
And I did look at a lot of photographs.

35:33.053 --> 35:39.362
It was a very well-photographed picture, you know, with street scenes, architecture.

35:40.034 --> 35:49.726
people at their pleasures, whether the opera and the restaurants and the bars and stuff like that.

35:49.746 --> 36:05.805
But most important to me were the street scenes and noticing that the traffic was always very heavy, except with horses and horse cars and carriages.

36:06.443 --> 36:28.925
The fact that you could tell from these black-and-white photos that the ordinary city bus, horse-drawn bus, was always painted white, and they always had little paintings on the doors of country scenes, all these municipal transport things.

36:28.945 --> 36:35.151
And that's how I suppose I decided that Martin would see

36:36.076 --> 36:39.340
It's quite a scene.

36:39.581 --> 36:43.206
It's a very powerful, very visual scene.

36:43.226 --> 36:46.430
In fact, it's a very visual book.

36:47.251 --> 37:01.290
I mean, you really do, you take care to really appeal to all of the senses, that just visually, but we hear the thing, we smell the thing, and feel it.

37:04.932 --> 37:07.755
Flaubert says that's what you have to do.

37:08.395 --> 37:16.804
He's the great theorist of fiction, and he said, you invoke all the senses.

37:17.865 --> 37:28.675
Just as a person, every moment of his waking life is sensible in every way to what surrounds him.

37:30.377 --> 37:34.281
But the idea of looking at a photograph and wanting to render it

37:35.172 --> 37:42.482
is very important in this process.

37:42.522 --> 37:57.922
And I did study very readily available photographs in New York or down the ports and the harbor and pictures taken from the top of the Brooklyn Bridge to show you the skyline of the time.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.467
They were very enterprising.

38:02.611 --> 38:16.563
You do say in the essay, in the collection, I guess it disturbs you that each generation does attempt to tear down the elements of the previous one.

38:17.824 --> 38:19.346
Is this a concern of yours?

38:19.466 --> 38:26.452
I mean, that we are so hasty to, if not tear down, cover up?

38:29.495 --> 38:31.977
Well, it's a

38:32.497 --> 38:40.848
It's unsettling that things that might be genuinely beautiful would be destroyed because some guy's going to make a few bucks.

38:42.871 --> 38:53.224
And there are agencies in New York, the Landmark Preservation Commission, and the Municipal Arts Society.

38:53.244 --> 38:56.809
There's a lot of pressure to preserve stuff that should be preserved.

38:59.893 --> 39:01.575
My feeling in this is that

39:02.011 --> 39:13.523
My discovery in this book was how much still exists from the past, even though we think we've erased it entirely.

39:13.683 --> 39:15.685
I noticed it driving in Manhattan.

39:15.765 --> 39:17.927
You stopped at a light.

39:18.728 --> 39:22.712
You'll see all of a sudden one little building is there.

39:23.313 --> 39:24.774
It's true.

39:24.854 --> 39:26.676
There are whole neighborhoods.

39:26.696 --> 39:31.461
Some of those row houses in the West Village, federal houses which go way back.

39:32.217 --> 39:39.626
Jefferson Market Courthouse, a couple of armories around town, the Cooper Union.

39:39.686 --> 39:50.118
You can start numerating things, but more than that, it's the layout of the streets, the names of the streets, the peculiar grid work down the village.

39:50.719 --> 39:53.482
It's all from very early days.

39:53.863 --> 39:58.528
What I hadn't realized, which you point out, is how rich, how wealthy New York

39:58.846 --> 40:02.390
became in the aftermath of the Civil War.

40:03.611 --> 40:07.154
It actually started during the Civil War.

40:07.194 --> 40:08.315
They just cleaned up.

40:09.437 --> 40:11.759
It was just, you know, wars do that.

40:12.219 --> 40:16.243
And that's when they start to move north.

40:16.263 --> 40:27.975
And all the wealthy people to get away from the immigrants and the working class, they start to go north of 23rd Street was north.

40:28.951 --> 40:31.935
That was too close, up to 34th.

40:32.916 --> 40:40.387
Suddenly, they were building mansions north of the reservoir on 5th Avenue, 42nd Street.

40:40.587 --> 40:49.539
By the time Tweed was around, he managed to get himself a spot in this newly fashionable neighborhood.

40:49.579 --> 40:53.845
Edith Wharton talks about an aunt of hers who built this

40:54.415 --> 41:00.103
It's amazing.

41:00.123 --> 41:23.477
Well, my aunt, who died last year at 102, told me that as a child,

41:25.600 --> 41:28.365
She lived on the Upper East Side with her parents.

41:30.329 --> 41:45.820
Her mother used to give her ten cents to go out downstairs and up a block to the farmer where she would pick the vetch, the carrots, the lettuce, the tomatoes from this truck farm.

41:46.120 --> 41:52.769
on 98th Street and Madison Avenue for her tenths, a penny for this, two cents for that.

41:52.790 --> 42:02.123
She'd come home with an onload of fresh vegetables that were from this farmer.

42:03.004 --> 42:05.067
This is just a vague question.

42:05.167 --> 42:12.077
I wonder how much New York is, how important New York is here.

42:12.985 --> 42:15.668
Well, it seems to be pretty important.

42:15.708 --> 42:21.175
It's just the place I usually set books.

42:21.676 --> 42:30.186
It's the, it's my Yachna-Patofa County.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.589
Somehow this has not been a plan.

42:32.609 --> 42:33.831
It's not been intention.

42:33.871 --> 42:35.493
I didn't set out to do this.

42:36.975 --> 42:41.220
But when, you know,

42:42.230 --> 42:44.914
It has been a setting for many of the books.

42:45.895 --> 42:47.477
And someone asked me about that.

42:47.657 --> 42:49.039
But it's more than a setting, too, though.

42:49.981 --> 42:53.005
Well, it's kind of a home for the imagination.

42:53.806 --> 42:55.268
Every writer needs two homes.

42:55.288 --> 42:56.810
It's certainly more than a setting here.

42:56.850 --> 42:58.072
I'm sorry.

42:58.092 --> 43:06.583
Well, if you're talking about me, every writer needs two homes, a place to live and a place for his imagination.

43:06.603 --> 43:07.765
That's one of the quotes.

43:09.145 --> 43:09.886
Isn't that true?

43:09.906 --> 43:11.508
Like Jack London.

43:11.628 --> 43:12.409
Jack London.

43:14.791 --> 43:19.576
What I described, he was just floundering until he went up to the Yukon.

43:19.596 --> 43:22.159
Suddenly there was his place.

43:22.179 --> 43:25.643
He was able to write about these dogs that thought like men.

43:27.705 --> 43:35.153
And for the rest of his life, that was his territory and the home for his imagination.

43:38.339 --> 43:46.810
But he was a Californian, so he had two places, one for his body and one for his mind, one for his imagination.

43:46.830 --> 43:48.812
My two places happened to coincide.

43:48.892 --> 43:52.877
It was very convenient.

43:53.237 --> 43:55.460
So I've always lived in and around New York.

43:56.301 --> 44:06.574
And it seems to be not all books.

44:08.056 --> 44:14.024
Loon Lake is upstate, and hard times out west, and so on and so forth.

44:14.124 --> 44:23.498
But I would say most of the books use New York.

44:24.619 --> 44:31.529
But as I say, I never thought about it until this was pointed out to me by the people around me.

44:31.569 --> 44:32.450
I said, are you really?

44:32.490 --> 44:36.696
So I started thinking about it.

44:37.250 --> 45:07.189
if you wanted to you could put these novels together this way you would start with the waterworks and then you would read ragtime and then billy bathgate say and then the book of daniel and you would have a hundred years of which starts in worcester yeah as you this is totally i won't be in the piece but did you were you familiar with this worcester area

45:07.726 --> 45:19.558
A close friend of mine, Harold Reese, perhaps you know him, he's a psychiatrist and lives in Worcester.

45:19.578 --> 45:37.716
And at the time I was thinking about this book, with the two families used to get together, our children were very small, and they would come down because they had relatives down where we were, or we'd come up to visit them and stay for weekends.

45:38.438 --> 45:45.908
And he was then an attending psychiatrist at Worcester State Hospital and lived on the grounds.

45:46.128 --> 45:47.710
On the campus.

45:47.730 --> 45:48.692
On the campus.

45:48.752 --> 45:55.220
So, you know, it was a little unsettling, but he ensured us.

45:57.243 --> 46:02.370
But you'd see these odd poor people standing at the bus stop.

46:03.008 --> 46:05.151
And the bus would come, and they wouldn't get on.

46:05.291 --> 46:13.801
I can't tell you how many hundreds of times I've driven to work and have that precise image that you have being like that.

46:14.161 --> 46:19.087
Just even coming around that little snake, you want to have that bus stop, which is there.

46:19.968 --> 46:20.208
Yeah.

46:20.889 --> 46:22.411
It was a startling thing.

46:22.431 --> 46:27.096
But you know, you just soak up stuff.

46:27.257 --> 46:31.902
And I decided to put them up there.

46:33.468 --> 46:34.951
And to use that.

46:35.111 --> 46:47.214
I used another, for the Lewin's house, I used the home of a friend of mine, Arthur Burney's professor of law at Boston College, on Winthrop Road.

46:49.338 --> 46:50.360
Everything is grist.

46:50.720 --> 46:50.921
Yes.

46:51.582 --> 46:53.025
I think we've got plenty of stuff.

46:53.225 --> 46:57.012
I would ask you, if you don't mind, to explore this for me.
