00:03.001 --> 00:11.149
And tell me a little bit, quite easily, I mean, is this a reflective kind of a book?

00:11.169 --> 00:15.994
Tell me what brought you into this reflection.

00:16.614 --> 00:21.900
I think that you see your life totally differently when you reach the point where you know that you're going to die.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.602
And I think that's the shift that happens in midlife.

00:25.663 --> 00:28.506
And you suddenly see your parents as human beings.

00:29.127 --> 00:31.489
You don't see them as obstacles to be overcome.

00:32.127 --> 00:38.416
And I'm very lucky in that my parents are both still alive and we've come through a transition in our relationship.

00:39.137 --> 00:43.183
I got very interested in my roots the way a lot of people do around the age of 50.

00:43.764 --> 00:45.506
And I began interviewing my parents.

00:46.989 --> 00:50.393
I would never have wanted to do that when I was younger.

00:50.413 --> 00:53.318
And I wanted to know how I got to be who I was.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.344
I wanted to see my parents as they were when they first fell in love.

00:58.405 --> 01:01.830
Not when they were parents, you know, with the capital P.

01:02.401 --> 01:28.425
and uh it was part of my coming to terms with my own life and it was so the impulse to do this the autobiographical impulse was so strong as i approached my 50th birthday that i put aside another book i was writing in order to write this book it was a book that absolutely had to be written also the other the thing that interested me very much was it seemed to me that my generation of women and also of men had gone through

01:28.878 --> 01:35.605
enormous shifts in what it meant to be a woman, what it meant to be a man, what it meant to be a father, what it meant to be a mother.

01:36.106 --> 01:41.411
We were raised for one world, and we found ourselves negotiating another, in a sense.

01:41.431 --> 01:47.838
We were raised to have stay-at-home mothers and fathers who were breadwinners.

01:47.858 --> 01:57.568
And we discovered, because of the economy, because we didn't have the fat economy of our parents post-World War II generation, that we both had to go out and be breadwinners.

01:58.173 --> 02:02.758
that we couldn't afford that social arrangement that they had taken for granted.

02:03.459 --> 02:08.664
It wasn't so much feminism that changed our lives, but the economy, in a way.

02:10.186 --> 02:12.508
And we had to figure out new ways of rearing children.

02:13.549 --> 02:26.323
And so it seemed to me that a whole generation had seen all the constants with which they were raised turn into something different as they grew up, and then found themselves raising children

02:26.573 --> 02:31.038
in an age that could not even have been contemplated or anticipated when they were little.

02:31.979 --> 02:34.181
And that seemed to me something interesting to write about.

02:34.442 --> 02:39.707
I mean, it seemed to me that I had spent my entire adult life feeling somehow in the wrong.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.891
I didn't raise my child right because I went out and worked.

02:43.491 --> 02:44.573
I didn't do this right.

02:45.093 --> 02:51.460
And then I discovered that every other woman I knew felt eternally in the wrong and had gone through the same passages.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.222
So that seemed an interesting thing.

02:53.641 --> 02:58.467
to chronicle these fantastic shifts in perspective.

02:59.369 --> 03:03.254
And as I got into it, I learned amazing things about myself.

03:04.255 --> 03:11.505
I learned what was important about my parents, the way my parents raised me, and why they made it possible for me to be a writer.

03:13.127 --> 03:18.374
Whatever neurotic things they did, the one thing that was constant was that they always encouraged the imagination.

03:19.796 --> 03:23.040
And I was never punished for my imaginary friends.

03:23.290 --> 03:23.851
for example.

03:25.052 --> 03:27.674
I was always, the imagination was something good.

03:28.635 --> 03:30.136
It was something positive.

03:30.437 --> 03:31.418
It was not silly.

03:31.618 --> 03:33.620
It was not, oh, don't say that.

03:34.621 --> 03:36.362
So it was very interesting for me.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.945
I mean, having written this book, I feel totally emptied out.

03:39.005 --> 03:41.467
Can't imagine what I'm going to do next.

03:41.827 --> 03:45.531
Well, was it a working out for you, or did you pretty much know where you expressed it?

03:45.551 --> 03:47.273
I did not know where I was going to go with it.

03:47.733 --> 03:49.855
I started out with the notion that

03:50.662 --> 04:02.556
We were the whiplash generation, and that I was as typical, although untypical, as anyone could be, in the sense that I felt that I had been swayed by all these great social changes.

04:03.617 --> 04:08.703
And as I wrote it, I discovered all kinds of things I never could have predicted.

04:09.504 --> 04:16.112
I didn't think that a big part of it would be understanding what it meant to be a secular Jew.

04:17.206 --> 04:26.740
A friend of mine had asked me, a friend who lives up in Middlebury and was editing the New England Review, had asked me to write an article about being Jewish.

04:30.325 --> 04:35.592
Being Jewish, and for special issues of the New England Review.

04:36.473 --> 04:42.522
And as I began to write about that, I saw that there was a whole autobiography in that.

04:43.042 --> 04:47.449
So many different things came into it, but it was absolutely a book I had to write.

04:47.489 --> 04:49.653
I wrote it with great passion.

04:50.714 --> 04:54.240
And the original draft had far too much statistics in it.

04:54.961 --> 05:06.400
I had also done a kind of Gayle Sheehy-esque thing of who is the typical American woman, what does the Census Bureau say, and when I came to the end of the manuscript, which was about 700 pages,

05:07.257 --> 05:10.700
I cut all that stuff out of the book and left the personal stuff.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.902
How long was this manuscript, just out of curiosity?

05:12.922 --> 05:35.543
When I, um, it was about five, six hundred, no, it was about six, but the original manuscript was about seven, and I cut it stringently by a hundred pages because I made the decision that the personal stuff was the lasting stuff, that all the Census Bureau, you know, where are women now, how many work outside the home,

05:36.046 --> 05:38.790
that that was something other people could do better than me.

05:39.050 --> 05:40.372
And that can be found elsewhere.

05:41.093 --> 05:43.877
Yeah, Gail Sheehy does it better, Naomi Wolf does it better.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.500
That was not my main case.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.903
This is really not what you're writing about in any case.

05:47.983 --> 05:50.808
No, it's an autobiography of a writer, really.

05:51.408 --> 05:53.692
I like the subtitle, a midlife memoir.

05:54.273 --> 06:00.982
In the Navy, you talk about flying an airplane, you make these big course corrections.

06:02.264 --> 06:04.888
You figure out where you are, and maybe you have to...

06:05.189 --> 06:12.256
Do you feel that you're making any... I mean, you talk about this is the second half of your life.

06:12.296 --> 06:13.477
How am I going to live it differently?

06:13.517 --> 06:14.859
How am I going to live it differently?

06:14.879 --> 06:15.639
Is it going to be different?

06:16.360 --> 06:18.903
Do you come to any conclusions personally in that regard?

06:20.504 --> 06:22.306
I think that... It's a midlife memoir.

06:22.326 --> 06:23.087
It's a reflection.

06:23.127 --> 06:27.671
But is it also... Do you project anything at the same time, I wonder?

06:28.512 --> 06:34.318
What I project is I take responsibility to a much larger extent than I ever did before for my own life.

06:34.957 --> 06:39.622
And I'm not looking for solutions outside myself.

06:40.864 --> 06:48.292
I don't believe that if I fall madly in love with some passing stranger, it's going to change my life.

06:48.713 --> 06:53.979
I don't think my life will be a lot different if this book is a bestseller or if it's not a bestseller.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.044
I have my vocation, really, and I know what I do.

06:58.504 --> 07:01.387
And it's within myself to find what's right or wrong for me.

07:01.407 --> 07:03.630
The external stuff matters far less.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.323
And that's not the way I felt when I was younger.

07:07.043 --> 07:13.471
I was obsessed with success, obsessed with falling in love with the right person.

07:13.591 --> 07:17.736
Now I know there's a person I have to fall in love with with this person here.

07:18.277 --> 07:20.659
There's a kind of calm and a serenity.

07:21.721 --> 07:27.087
And if I don't feel it all the time, it's a goal that I have.

07:27.968 --> 07:29.430
Would there be a fear of 50?

07:29.490 --> 07:33.955
I don't mean just the title, but I mean this reflection.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.187
of these anxieties if there hadn't been a fear of flying?

07:37.528 --> 07:39.850
I mean, this is the 16th book, I guess?

07:39.870 --> 07:40.431
Yes.

07:40.451 --> 07:46.336
I mean, but that's the one, of course, that if you say Erika John is a fear of flying.

07:46.376 --> 07:47.457
Has that been a burden for you?

07:47.918 --> 07:49.159
Oh, terrible burden.

07:49.179 --> 07:56.326
I mean, and is that burden somehow responsible for your having to do this?

07:56.566 --> 07:59.229
No, all my titles are very tongue-in-cheek.

07:59.529 --> 08:04.414
I mean, I think that's, except, yeah, except Saranissima, let's say, but

08:04.681 --> 08:08.806
My chapter titles are tongue-in-cheek, and my titles are tongue-in-cheek.

08:09.447 --> 08:17.238
I never really thought that I was looking for the audience that read Fear of Flying or anything like that.

08:17.658 --> 08:18.499
I thought it was funny.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.842
Actually, this book is quite different from Fear of Flying.

08:20.942 --> 08:22.925
It's an autobiography.

08:22.985 --> 08:24.147
Fear of Flying is a novel.

08:25.248 --> 08:30.795
My point is there wouldn't be a Fear of Fifty, regardless of what you want to call it.

08:31.016 --> 08:31.296
Right.

08:31.681 --> 08:34.644
if this other book hadn't had such a profound influence.

08:34.664 --> 08:35.345
Exactly.

08:35.425 --> 08:38.168
Or impact, I guess, not influence, but impact in your life.

08:39.429 --> 08:45.796
And one of the questions is, when you get those answered prayers, how do you live out the rest of your life?

08:46.697 --> 08:50.641
We all want, we all think we want great fame.

08:51.902 --> 08:55.906
We all think we want money and to be sent to Hollywood.

08:56.126 --> 09:01.452
But when it really happens, what actually happens to a person

09:01.718 --> 09:07.426
who's pretty sensitive and aware and scholarly, who goes through that experience.

09:07.726 --> 09:09.428
It's not at all what you expect.

09:10.189 --> 09:12.452
And it proves to be something that you have to live through.

09:12.512 --> 09:15.036
And it proves to be a test, really.

09:15.096 --> 09:19.322
Another test of grace.

09:19.842 --> 09:24.168
And it proves to be extremely humbling.

09:25.990 --> 09:28.654
If you had the scenario to be played out differently,

09:29.225 --> 09:33.150
Would you have preferred the fear of flying not be the overwhelming success that it was?

09:35.133 --> 09:37.456
I can't imagine my life hadn't been different.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.619
I mean, these are the opportunities I was given.

09:39.659 --> 09:43.885
I mean, we're all given a set of circumstances to make of what we will.

09:45.066 --> 09:47.870
And those were mine.

09:48.351 --> 09:49.993
For a long time, I didn't know what to do with it.

09:51.255 --> 09:57.443
The truth of the matter is that many writers who write books of the sort that fear of flying became never write again.

09:57.878 --> 09:59.380
or never write for publication.

10:00.561 --> 10:03.404
Their lives explode or implode in various ways.

10:03.504 --> 10:06.867
I mean, you think of Salinger with Catcher in the Rye.

10:08.168 --> 10:09.430
Only wrote short stories.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.252
Fragmentary works after that.

10:12.913 --> 10:17.057
The exposure is so great that it almost makes you self-conscious.

10:20.681 --> 10:21.902
She only wrote that one book.

10:22.122 --> 10:22.302
Remember?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.506
That's one book.

10:25.646 --> 10:27.868
You never saw anything from her again.

10:28.338 --> 10:32.043
The guy who wrote Raintree County, Lockridge, one book.

10:32.063 --> 10:34.346
And he killed himself, didn't he?

10:34.366 --> 10:34.666
I think.

10:34.746 --> 10:36.548
I was just... Broad again.

10:37.610 --> 10:37.790
Yeah.

10:38.611 --> 10:40.373
Biography by his son, somehow.

10:40.393 --> 10:40.694
Really?

10:42.035 --> 10:42.176
Yeah.

10:42.436 --> 10:48.443
It's very hard to survive that kind of fame when you become the spokesperson for a generation.

10:50.346 --> 10:51.928
Especially so early in your career.

10:52.168 --> 10:55.172
I mean, it wasn't your first book, but...

10:56.485 --> 10:58.548
You know, look at Catch-22, do the Joe Heller.

10:58.568 --> 11:01.972
I mean, he has to carry that poor thing.

11:02.072 --> 11:03.314
It's a big burden to carry.

11:03.554 --> 11:04.135
It really is.

11:04.775 --> 11:09.742
It's almost as if, I mean, people speak to me about fear of flying the way they speak about the Kennedy assassination.

11:10.843 --> 11:15.369
I remember where I was when I read that book.

11:15.429 --> 11:18.813
My question goes back to what you said earlier, somebody who's scholarly and literary.

11:19.434 --> 11:23.539
My first recollection of Erika Jung is not fear of flying.

11:23.823 --> 11:30.751
But sitting in an audience here in Boston where you spoke, it was a Boston Herald luncheon.

11:31.472 --> 11:34.356
It's got to be, you know, 79 or 80 or something like that.

11:34.716 --> 11:38.381
And you get up and you spoke about poetry and the power of imagery.

11:38.821 --> 11:50.455
And I was sitting with this editor from Little Brown, and we both said, jeez, that was really, you know, you didn't talk anything about, you know, flying or the,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.194
I don't even remember what your book was at the time.

11:53.274 --> 11:55.097
I mean, it was irrelevant to lunches.

11:55.177 --> 11:55.958
Do you remember this?

11:56.018 --> 11:57.140
It was a poetry book.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.885
It was a book and author luncheon for the Boston Herald.

12:00.905 --> 12:02.067
It was terrific.

12:02.087 --> 12:02.688
It was really good.

12:02.768 --> 12:03.189
Thank you.

12:03.209 --> 12:03.549
It was nice.

12:03.569 --> 12:04.050
I remember it.

12:04.230 --> 12:10.219
And then my wife drove me in today, and I'm going over, and I said, I read a couple of your poems in here.

12:11.241 --> 12:14.626
I said, she says, I wouldn't have known about the poetry.

12:14.646 --> 12:18.011
And I said, no, I mean, there were many, many sides to the writer.

12:18.131 --> 12:20.374
And I guess that's kind of a shame, isn't it, that these,

12:21.232 --> 12:33.065
These layers, I guess, these textures of you are perhaps lost to so many of the people with 12 and a half million, or millions upon millions of readers, with 12.5 million copies of the book.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.487
Does that disturb you in some way?

12:35.507 --> 12:39.071
Oh, it's always disturbed me, but, you know, I make my peace with it.

12:39.091 --> 12:43.616
I mean, when you have a book that's a phenom, that has to happen.

12:47.781 --> 12:50.023
But who gets to choose what they get famous for?

12:50.138 --> 12:56.146
You can describe the scene in San Francisco after you had your daughter and you're reading this poem, and they're hissing you.

12:56.847 --> 13:05.219
Now, that must have been pretty... That was what it meant to be on the firing line of the women's movement in the last 20 years.

13:05.259 --> 13:05.739
You betrayed them.

13:05.759 --> 13:06.581
You were a traitor.

13:06.921 --> 13:17.175
Because of writing about childbirth, because there was a whole generation of women for whom feminism meant throw out whatever their mothers had done.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.044
I understand that now.

13:19.164 --> 13:20.145
I didn't then.

13:20.646 --> 13:23.189
And maybe they thought I was plumping for compulsory.

13:23.209 --> 13:23.709
Maybe you understand it.

13:23.729 --> 13:27.353
You understand what... I understand what their reaction was.

13:27.493 --> 13:38.605
They had seen me as the person who was the heroine of throw away the old reserve, throw away staying at home in the suburbs and raising a child.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.146
I had become a symbol to them.

13:40.347 --> 13:44.371
They didn't really know who I was or what I really represented or what kind of feminist I was.

13:44.871 --> 13:46.453
But the book had become a symbol...

13:46.653 --> 13:49.356
of breaking chains, you know, breaking out.

13:50.017 --> 13:54.602
And when I read poems about childbirth, they felt that I had recanted.

13:55.664 --> 13:56.625
I hadn't recanted.

13:56.685 --> 14:04.334
I was the same person with different facets to me, and I didn't believe that women should take a back seat in power just because they had babies.

14:05.155 --> 14:09.360
But they made an assumption based on my public image, which wasn't even who I was.

14:10.301 --> 14:14.426
So there was a lot of that kind of buffeting, which is maybe interesting to write about.

14:14.466 --> 14:16.508
The movement has changed.

14:16.690 --> 14:24.678
And I think we're going to see, in the next decade, we're going to see a much more pragmatic side to the women's movement.

14:24.858 --> 14:28.001
We're going to learn to build alliances.

14:28.481 --> 14:29.803
We're going to join hands.

14:29.923 --> 14:31.805
Different kinds of feminists are going to join hands.

14:32.325 --> 14:35.989
And there's going to be less of that because we're really going to enter the political process.

14:36.649 --> 14:38.651
And in order to do that, we have to build alliances.

14:38.932 --> 14:43.016
We can't have these stupid emotional reactions, you know.

14:43.176 --> 14:46.579
As a father of two young daughters, I'm very happy.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.343
How old are your daughters?

14:50.563 --> 14:55.209
My older daughter is 13 and the younger is 11.

14:55.229 --> 15:01.476
I took them both for a ride to New York on a day trip down and back.

15:01.496 --> 15:03.859
Just go to bookstores and walk around.

15:04.199 --> 15:04.579
Great.

15:04.860 --> 15:12.128
Are you familiar with this book?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.555
And I haven't read it, but I'm familiar with it.

15:14.575 --> 15:18.941
The Who Stole Feminism book that's been making... I've read it, yeah.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.823
Any reaction to that or response?

15:20.883 --> 15:37.686
I mean, is that germane in any of the things that you're saying about feminists actually becoming more of a... Well, the book raises very interesting questions, and it's been summarily dismissed out of hand by a lot of feminists.

15:37.966 --> 15:40.950
I mean, I've seen Ellie Smeal debating...

15:41.403 --> 15:43.285
Christina Hoff Summers on television.

15:45.607 --> 15:54.375
Summers raises some interesting questions about doctrinaire feminism and what it's become in the academic world.

15:54.395 --> 15:56.477
And I think those questions should be heard.

15:57.718 --> 15:58.819
She teaches a clerk, by the way.

15:58.839 --> 15:59.840
Does she?

16:00.341 --> 16:03.444
Although I'm writing out for a dozen newspapers, I should tell you that when I'm done.

16:04.425 --> 16:06.747
I mean, this won't just be in Worcester.

16:07.047 --> 16:07.648
Oh, how great.

16:07.668 --> 16:08.929
So you have a little syndicate.

16:09.550 --> 16:14.699
Yeah, a couple million.

16:14.919 --> 16:17.183
A combined circulation is about a million and a half.

16:17.203 --> 16:18.285
That's so wonderful.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.388
You should get Parade.

16:21.129 --> 16:22.291
They need a book on.

16:22.311 --> 16:24.996
I mean, 200 words.

16:25.096 --> 16:26.899
I mean, how can you say anything?

16:27.079 --> 16:27.400
That's true.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.322
Four paragraphs.

16:29.624 --> 16:35.153
I really like to develop a nice long, I mean, I can write 3,000 words if it can be.

16:35.335 --> 16:36.917
You know, that's never been my problem.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.862
I don't want to leave this.

16:40.882 --> 16:42.605
You had a quote in there towards the end.

16:42.745 --> 16:51.036
This book is written on, every book I have written has been written on the bleeding corpse of my grandmother.

16:52.097 --> 16:56.303
Could you just explain that sentence to me, that statement?

16:56.463 --> 17:04.954
My grandmother really believed that women should wear white kid gloves and that we should have duvet covers that were freshly pressed and made out of linens.

17:05.677 --> 17:11.344
And her whole life was absorbed in that, and she was a very bright woman.

17:12.186 --> 17:16.431
But I think of the way I would like to live and don't.

17:17.012 --> 17:19.375
I don't have linen sheets.

17:21.658 --> 17:25.283
I can't even get a housekeeper with iron linen sheets.

17:25.944 --> 17:34.435
So I think that women's lives, I mean, as we've sort of branched out and done other things, our lives, those things have suffered.

17:35.039 --> 17:36.781
And I'm always aware of them.

17:36.801 --> 17:41.785
I'm always aware of the beautiful things that make a home run that women can't do anymore.

17:41.905 --> 17:43.987
We don't have time to do anymore.

17:44.007 --> 17:44.948
But I regret them.

17:47.531 --> 17:50.774
Who do you write the book for?

17:50.794 --> 17:56.299
Is this written for a new generation of women, or is it written for... I think somebody wants you.

17:57.580 --> 18:01.744
Is that supposed to be speaking like that?

18:01.764 --> 18:03.746
Okay.

18:03.766 --> 18:03.966
Okay.

18:05.819 --> 18:15.290
I guess I was wondering what you would like to read.

18:15.310 --> 18:19.475
First of all, did you ever have a reader in mind, who your reader is?

18:19.875 --> 18:21.377
I never really know who my reader is.

18:21.457 --> 18:24.080
I mean, I'm always surprised by who my reader is.

18:25.001 --> 18:27.784
The Henry Miller book, for example, had a very young audience.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.207
That was very interesting.

18:30.490 --> 18:31.451
That is interesting.

18:31.471 --> 18:33.615
I would have thought a more solid kind of an audience.

18:33.635 --> 18:39.904
The people who came into the stores were kids in their 20s who wanted to be writers and go to Paris and follow in Henry.

18:39.924 --> 18:41.386
I mean, there was a much younger audience.

18:41.506 --> 18:43.069
You never really know when you write a book.

18:43.169 --> 18:45.532
And I write the book I have to write.

18:45.632 --> 18:47.415
I write what is the next book in my head.

18:47.435 --> 18:58.371
I think that this book will be read by many of the people who clutched Fear of Flying as a Bible because it recounts

18:58.958 --> 19:28.020
so much of the life that we have all shared i think that i think men identify with the book as well it doesn't deal only with women's issues and the changes that have happened in our lives over the last 20 years have also happened to men inevitably the family has changed tremendously so that i don't know exactly who the ideal reader is initially it will be women like me women of what i call the whiplash generation um

19:28.270 --> 19:30.272
But I think it will have a very big audience.

19:30.312 --> 19:40.645
I think it will have an audience also of men of my generation and then of younger women who are looking for how to make work and children go together.

19:41.326 --> 19:48.054
Describe, you do in the book, of course, and even kind of trademark patent pending on a whiplash.

19:48.534 --> 19:51.678
But tell me a little bit about that and what you mean by that.

19:52.699 --> 19:55.122
I'm thinking of the women who were raised

19:55.523 --> 20:23.623
in the era of um doris day when doris day was the ego ideal of every young girl and then who came into their 20s wanting to be gloria steiner and then who raised their children in the age of madonna and who saw all the ideals of womanhood change back and forth on the shortest possible cycle like this like spectators at a tennis game and that's what i mean by whiplash i mean

20:24.127 --> 20:31.175
If we had grown up to be the women we were supposed to be, we would have been bad ladies.

20:31.295 --> 20:32.917
We would never have been able to make a living.

20:32.997 --> 20:36.121
We would have been thrown out of marriages and broke.

20:36.161 --> 20:46.573
So in other words, we had to change all the things that we intended to do, planned to do, as we went along, as the culture changed.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.808
Do you remember the movie Alfie, What's It All About?

20:52.189 --> 20:55.793
I mean, is this the kind of thing you ask yourself when you're writing a book like this?

20:55.833 --> 20:57.234
What's it all about?

20:57.254 --> 21:00.538
Or do you pretty much know what it's all about?

21:02.079 --> 21:08.526
And I guess in terms of your life, not just your own life and how it went and what it means.

21:09.027 --> 21:12.291
I always question what does my life mean?

21:12.731 --> 21:14.613
You know, am I doing meaningful work?

21:15.734 --> 21:16.655
Where am I going?

21:16.715 --> 21:18.197
What am I going to do next?

21:18.650 --> 21:21.494
What does one live for?

21:21.554 --> 21:24.177
What are the worthwhile things to live for?

21:24.197 --> 21:29.605
To have work you love, to have people you love in your life.

21:29.965 --> 21:31.127
But what are we here for?

21:31.427 --> 21:37.815
We're a very strange species that's been bred upon this planet, and often a very self-destructive species.

21:38.436 --> 21:41.540
And you can't help but wonder those things as you're writing it.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.045
But my task, really, in writing this book was to get it right

21:45.970 --> 21:47.172
to get the story.

21:47.392 --> 21:53.942
I wanted to write the story of the last 50 years and what they've meant in the lives of women, but I could only tell it through my story.

21:54.763 --> 21:55.484
Your passage.

21:57.046 --> 22:03.335
And I believe that if you get it right through one woman's story, you get it right.

22:03.515 --> 22:07.301
And I do believe that autobiography is a liberating act.

22:07.902 --> 22:10.105
I mean, if you think of the autobiography's

22:10.540 --> 22:35.944
that have been written, for example, by African-American writers, Maya Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, or James Baldwin's autobiographical writing, those books are radical acts, not because they speak about every member of that population, but because of, through writing about one person's story, they show a whole pattern in a society.

22:37.005 --> 22:39.467
And those autobiographies have been liberating books.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.863
I think we live in a great age of autobiography.

22:43.964 --> 22:51.652
You mentioned going back when your aspirations were for ambition and success, all these things that we all have.

22:52.573 --> 23:00.541
But did you have, did you mindfully like your flying thought that it would be this overwhelming... I mean, nobody... Nobody could, no.

23:01.522 --> 23:04.425
But did you know that it would be a commercial book, at least?

23:04.445 --> 23:05.226
No.

23:05.786 --> 23:06.247
Not at all.

23:06.647 --> 23:07.328
I never thought...

23:08.000 --> 23:11.465
Because this is the anniversary coming up, isn't it?

23:11.606 --> 23:13.669
So why don't I talk a little bit about that, if you don't mind?

23:14.290 --> 23:14.991
Do you have a line?

23:15.271 --> 23:18.596
Yeah, just a reflection on that, because it does fit into the reflection, I think.

23:18.616 --> 23:21.080
I never thought it was a commercial book when I was writing it.

23:22.462 --> 23:28.972
I thought it was a book about a young woman who wanted to be a poet and her adventure, her odyssey.

23:29.113 --> 23:35.863
What I wanted to put into that book was all the things in a woman's head that had not been put on paper before.

23:36.502 --> 23:56.663
The fantasies about men, the dreams of greatness and grandeur, the sexual thoughts that are forbidden to speak about, much less write about, all those things.

23:56.763 --> 24:01.969
I wanted the book to be as full of a real woman's thoughts.

24:03.046 --> 24:04.588
as any book had ever been.

24:04.768 --> 24:07.551
I didn't, I hadn't found that in other women's novels.

24:08.192 --> 24:09.894
I mean, were there any anxieties?

24:09.934 --> 24:13.699
You were a young woman, or a young woman at the time?

24:14.079 --> 24:15.160
I was terrified.

24:15.481 --> 24:19.766
I mean, because you could really ruin a career this way, too, don't you think?

24:20.086 --> 24:24.992
I mean, there must have been the thought that I could really be, I mean, look what happened before.

24:25.012 --> 24:31.279
It didn't want Philip Loth, or any little important I used to play, but it certainly did.

24:31.299 --> 24:32.040
For many years,

24:32.375 --> 24:59.428
really heard him tremendously didn't it i'm not asking your comment on that but i'm just trying to draw a comparison i was very i mean i was very aware that there was a price for telling the truth but that if you're going to write books you must tell the truth what are you offering your readers if you don't tell the truth i mean there is there is certain entertainment reading that you pass the time with

25:00.421 --> 25:04.585
And some of it is very good and written on a high level, and some of it is trash.

25:04.605 --> 25:06.127
And I think that has its function.

25:07.188 --> 25:09.990
You know, something to read on the airplane and stuff.

25:10.010 --> 25:16.456
But a real writer tries to tell the truth and tries to make people look at their lives in a different way than they did before.

25:17.417 --> 25:19.579
That seems to me to be what writers do.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.521
It's a kind of sacred trust.

25:22.442 --> 25:24.724
You do absolutely the best you can.

25:25.826 --> 25:29.449
And it seems to me that though there's a high price for telling the truth,

25:30.172 --> 25:33.337
It's that that you sign on for when you become a writer.

25:34.959 --> 25:39.626
Were you surprised by the response to the book?

25:39.646 --> 25:40.808
Enormously surprised.

25:41.208 --> 25:41.969
I didn't expect.

25:43.011 --> 25:45.314
And it did, of course, change your life dramatically.

25:45.374 --> 25:46.135
It changed my life.

25:47.157 --> 25:56.871
I left the academic world, which I was sort of edging out of anyway, and I became a full-time professional writer.

25:57.627 --> 26:01.131
which is also an enormous burden, as you know, because you have to.

26:01.891 --> 26:10.600
Making a living writing books in an age when television is the dominant medium, not books, can be a very up-and-down life.

26:11.581 --> 26:18.949
It's certainly not an easy life in the age when publishers get fired and shuffled around.

26:19.229 --> 26:19.990
It's a hard way.

26:20.210 --> 26:24.394
You make a point in here, which anyone who's ever tried to wait for a living can

26:25.049 --> 26:28.292
I mean, anybody who thinks you do this to make money is crazy.

26:28.312 --> 26:30.694
I mean, you can never be repaid.

26:30.834 --> 26:33.877
I can never be repaid for the amount of time, effort.

26:34.518 --> 26:35.799
Even correcting the proof.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.401
Because he's gone into this.

26:37.521 --> 26:41.024
Whatever you make is not enough, is my feeling on it.

26:41.044 --> 26:42.285
I mean, it's irrelevant.

26:42.305 --> 26:44.747
You don't think about it while you're doing it.

26:44.788 --> 26:46.029
My brother's an attorney.

26:46.049 --> 26:49.712
You know, the media goes on when you're talking.

26:50.493 --> 26:52.395
You know what I'm saying?

26:52.415 --> 26:52.795
And he asked me,

26:53.180 --> 26:58.807
I don't want to know, but I wouldn't begin to calculate it.

26:59.188 --> 27:02.372
About two cents an hour is about where you make it.

27:02.432 --> 27:07.018
You know, when you decide to become a professional writer, you're not doing this for the big bucks.

27:07.098 --> 27:07.258
No.

27:07.939 --> 27:18.813
There's something that's driving you to do it and to ease away from the cocoon of academia, I'm sure.

27:18.913 --> 27:20.655
Partly that, but also because

27:21.310 --> 27:47.571
what had moved me most as a child were books i mean i loved books and books had had tremendous power i thought um the power to make me go to a different place feel i was somewhere else it just seemed to me to be what i wanted to do because writers and books were very important to me nobody does it for money of course there are some few maybe less than 20 entertainer writers

27:48.023 --> 27:50.326
who make $50 million a year.

27:52.709 --> 27:54.671
But that's not the kind of writer I am.

27:54.932 --> 28:01.259
I mean, they're writers who really specifically do write to entertain, and I think some of them do it very well.

28:03.602 --> 28:05.324
But I'm not that kind of writer.

28:05.344 --> 28:16.098
I write what I have to write, and I hope that by exposing my heart, I help other people deal with their own lives in a different way.

28:16.118 --> 28:17.980
Is the best for you a hit, do you think?

28:19.681 --> 28:22.584
I'm going to write very different kinds of books, I think.

28:22.604 --> 28:23.545
I hope I will.

28:24.586 --> 28:28.970
I had started, when this book started to come, I had started a novel set in the future.

28:30.311 --> 28:33.214
It's a kind of Brave New World novel.

28:33.234 --> 28:37.157
And I'm going to go back and see what's happened to that book while I was working on this.

28:37.978 --> 28:39.439
This is the one you were working on?

28:39.459 --> 28:40.560
Mm-hmm.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.841
When this book started to come.

28:42.382 --> 28:44.464
And I have a bunch of other ideas in my notebook.

28:44.484 --> 28:45.104
I always do.

28:45.325 --> 28:48.928
And it will be a novel that I know.

28:50.292 --> 28:54.056
But I don't know exactly where it's going yet.

28:54.417 --> 28:57.541
Now, what prompted you to do the Miller book, for instance?

28:57.561 --> 29:00.744
That's just a lot of... That's not in the sequence, really, is it?

29:01.746 --> 29:04.048
Or is it?

29:06.071 --> 29:07.733
It was an interesting book for me.

29:08.373 --> 29:14.561
It was really... I got pushed into doing it by Joni Evans, who said, you have to write about Henry.

29:14.761 --> 29:17.024
You're the only person who really understands Henry.

29:17.064 --> 29:18.105
You have to write about Henry.

29:18.845 --> 29:23.051
And actually it was a very interesting experience for me writing that book about Henry Miller.

29:24.553 --> 29:27.637
I realized I never want to write a biography, a true biography.

29:31.282 --> 29:34.166
And I learned a lot about his life and about writers' lives.

29:34.786 --> 29:36.669
And that book has had its own impact.

29:36.709 --> 29:40.374
You know, it was a bit of a disaster because my publisher got fired the day it was published.

29:40.414 --> 29:42.437
For reasons that had nothing to do with the book.

29:42.917 --> 29:48.565
But it was, it sold out its first printing of 25,000 copies and then they wouldn't re-print it.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.351
They wouldn't reprint it.

29:50.512 --> 29:52.413
Can't you have a lawsuit on that?

29:53.074 --> 29:57.138
Even though I have a free lawyer, even though my husband is a lawyer, I would not.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.441
I think it would be very hard, too.

29:59.781 --> 30:01.683
People say, why don't you sue them?

30:01.743 --> 30:02.444
I said, for what?

30:03.064 --> 30:08.269
To get the rest of my advance, which was small to begin with, and to make myself a pariah in the business?

30:08.570 --> 30:10.852
Did they want you to pay back his ass?

30:10.872 --> 30:12.353
If they asked for it, they're not going to get it.

30:13.014 --> 30:14.956
I'd love for them to ask for it.

30:15.076 --> 30:15.837
Then I might sue.

30:16.177 --> 30:17.258
No, I kept it.

30:17.459 --> 30:17.939
I kept it.

30:17.999 --> 30:18.940
They've not asked for it.

30:19.105 --> 30:21.376
Let me breach the contract.

30:21.396 --> 30:23.164
Publishers do that more and more, you know.

30:23.365 --> 30:24.290
Totally breached it.

30:24.310 --> 30:26.500
I mean, I've got a letter.
