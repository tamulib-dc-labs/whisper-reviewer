WEBVTT

00:04.418 --> 00:06.942
Why don't you start that sentence again, sir?

00:06.962 --> 00:13.971
Well, what about the compulsive collectors who have a real mental problem about getting rid of things?

00:13.991 --> 00:15.734
Like Sir Thomas Phillips.

00:15.754 --> 00:19.539
Like Sir Thomas Phillips, but they're old.

00:19.559 --> 00:25.567
Oh, the Collier brothers, in 1947, wonderful jobs that was killed by the stuff.

00:25.828 --> 00:27.050
Death by books.

00:27.070 --> 00:27.851
Yeah, that's right.

00:28.051 --> 00:30.234
That's exactly it.

00:30.534 --> 00:32.417
Now, there was a man in

00:32.684 --> 00:34.966
outside of Chicago named Harding.

00:34.986 --> 00:37.049
Do you know Harding?

00:37.249 --> 00:37.649
No.

00:38.210 --> 00:40.252
No, but I've been looking for things.

00:40.272 --> 00:40.332
No.

00:40.352 --> 00:41.333
Where would I find out about him?

00:41.413 --> 00:51.504
Harding was a very wonderful collection of music over a long lifetime, like 70 years or so.

00:53.026 --> 00:54.608
And he filled his house.

00:55.569 --> 00:57.831
And as the inner city died,

00:58.317 --> 01:04.924
his house remained, and in the end, it was surrounded by empty lots, you know, and bottles flowing down the street.

01:04.944 --> 01:15.295
But inside the house, it was solid music collections of, you know, every scrap of sheet music that came out, and he got it, and the books, and everything.

01:15.315 --> 01:19.079
Older material as well as .

01:19.299 --> 01:19.860
What happened?

01:20.361 --> 01:25.086
Well, he made a deal at the end of his life with the Bodleian Library.

01:26.067 --> 01:26.367
Wow.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.612
And Mike Turner is the person to get a hold of an Oscar.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.194
We're going to England and Naples.

01:32.334 --> 01:34.296
Michael Turner mentioned my name.

01:35.678 --> 01:40.884
The Harding Collection is there, and it is supposed to have a separate room, I believe.

01:41.765 --> 01:44.589
So this is a case of something leaving America.

01:44.609 --> 01:44.709
Yeah.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.330
You have to go back.

01:45.350 --> 01:45.910
It's wonderful.

01:45.930 --> 01:46.912
Going against the parents.

01:46.992 --> 01:47.332
Yeah.

01:47.352 --> 01:48.874
And it was done by Michael.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.717
Michael found out about it and went over there a couple of times.

01:51.758 --> 01:52.759
He wooed him.

01:53.059 --> 01:53.440
Wooed him?

01:53.580 --> 01:54.140
Definitely.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.442
Definitely.

01:55.912 --> 01:58.515
Michael Turner at Oxford University?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.176
At the Bodleian.

01:59.296 --> 02:01.779
At the Bodleian.

02:01.799 --> 02:05.183
We have to look at Oxford anyway.

02:05.203 --> 02:05.563
That's wonderful.

02:05.743 --> 02:06.985
Where approximately was it?

02:07.525 --> 02:16.496
This occurred in about 1972 or three, and the books came back over.

02:16.616 --> 02:19.860
The books traveled something like 1974.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.902
Were there any

02:22.169 --> 02:27.055
I think there were.

02:27.435 --> 02:31.520
I'm not sure, but I can't believe that Newberry wasn't interested.

02:31.540 --> 02:34.423
Oh, it's Chicago, though, Wes.

02:34.544 --> 02:34.644
Yeah.

02:34.664 --> 02:38.308
But Michael will fill you in on the whole thing.

02:38.328 --> 02:49.241
Yeah, well, we'll be doing a number of, well, Carter Bolivian, for instance, again.

02:49.261 --> 02:52.024
I mean, just in the subject, he's got 70, 80, 90,000 books, and many years of collecting.

02:52.848 --> 02:59.976
Yeah.

02:59.996 --> 03:09.486
I've dealt with him.

03:09.806 --> 03:21.319
And I'm covering, I'm going to the auctions.

03:22.531 --> 03:23.712
Yeah.

03:23.953 --> 03:29.078
Which has been interesting.

03:29.499 --> 03:31.080
Just to get a feel of what's going on.

03:31.100 --> 03:34.864
Are you going to discuss Haven O'Moore's collecting style?

03:34.884 --> 03:34.945
No.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.706
Are you familiar at all with this one?

03:37.167 --> 03:39.870
Only with the catalog and what people tell me.

03:40.310 --> 03:41.552
I've never met him.

03:41.572 --> 03:42.493
I've met him.

03:42.713 --> 03:44.135
Yes, I am.

03:44.155 --> 03:44.255
Good.

03:44.295 --> 03:46.077
What's your sense of Haven O'Moore?

03:46.417 --> 03:51.002
Well, all I know is what I've read in the published catalog.

03:51.134 --> 04:14.796
and discussions with other libraries, which is more than an unorthodox figure in our field, and that his views are pretty hard to do.

04:15.477 --> 04:20.061
Well, he wrote that thing for the Catalan, and that's why they called Nick Blackburn.

04:20.362 --> 04:46.318
But the astonishing thing about the collection, aside from the character, which is so strange, the astonishing thing about the collection is that it was formed almost as an exercise,

04:46.923 --> 04:57.314
Mr. Hagen-O'more may say that he loves these books and that they are as important as, you know, the blood in his veins or whatever.

04:57.334 --> 05:02.600
But in fact, he was buying these books just months before the sale.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.062
With somebody else's money.

05:04.082 --> 05:05.743
With somebody else's money, exactly.

05:05.763 --> 05:10.188
So it's not the same kind of collection as Arthur Hosen.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.189
Do you have any sense of Arthur?

05:11.209 --> 05:14.433
No, you mentioned Arthur Hosen.

05:15.073 --> 05:16.575
There's a great collector.

05:16.910 --> 05:17.751
Who stops.

05:18.913 --> 05:19.855
Absolutely.

05:20.075 --> 05:21.317
I wonder why.

05:21.337 --> 05:23.540
Do you have any sense of that?

05:23.560 --> 05:32.975
Because we are, one of the interests of my studies is motivation.

05:34.557 --> 05:41.508
What drives a person to become a bibliomania or whatever.

05:41.528 --> 05:44.993
But similarly, what drives... Art Golden went to Harvard.

05:45.334 --> 05:45.634
He stops.

05:46.019 --> 05:53.090
And he met Bill Jackson.

05:53.110 --> 05:56.976
At some point he met Jackson, just when he was young.

05:58.599 --> 06:01.383
Or maybe it wasn't Jackson, it was Rosenbach.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.208
It was Rosenbach that taught Houghton to collect.

06:04.228 --> 06:12.060
That's right, because in Ed Wolf's book, about Rosenbach, he does say that Arthur Houghton at one time was the greatest book collector collected.

06:12.783 --> 06:14.845
Well, this is in the biography of Rosenbach.

06:14.865 --> 06:25.336
Anyway, but Jackson got, you know, the young Harvard student interested in at least giving the money for the library in 1940, which was named after him.

06:25.356 --> 06:29.180
But then, several things happened, didn't they?

06:29.200 --> 06:41.592
The Gutenberg Bible at Harvard was stolen by a kid from Northchester Heights, and he fell from the roof of Weidner, and he

06:41.791 --> 06:45.354
never recovered, or I don't know what kind of thing the Bible was recovered.

06:45.374 --> 06:46.436
You know, I don't know this story?

06:47.016 --> 06:53.362
Oh, Bill Bond wrote it up in the Harvard Magazine about three years ago, and then you ought to look it up.

06:53.382 --> 06:55.645
How did somebody get access to the Gutenberg Bible?

06:56.125 --> 07:05.114
By the classic museum theft is you wait in, you hide in the closet until the museum closes, and then you go get what it is.

07:05.134 --> 07:08.457
You know, the Gutenberg, where there's nowhere to be seen in the Houghton Library.

07:08.909 --> 07:09.892
No, it's in the Widener.

07:10.153 --> 07:10.895
It's never been.

07:10.915 --> 07:12.359
It's in the Widener.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.586
It's the gift of the Widener.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.455
I'm doing all my work on the Widener.

07:17.475 --> 07:18.859
I haven't seen it.

07:18.959 --> 07:19.882
It's in the Widener room.

07:20.344 --> 07:22.229
It's in the Widener room in the Widener library.

07:22.269 --> 07:23.172
Yeah, I believe so.

07:23.725 --> 07:26.129
I'm only there twice a week.

07:26.309 --> 07:35.986
Okay, in Harvard Yard, you walk up the steps into Widener, and once you get in Widener, there's another bunch of steps with sergeant murals on either side of a door.

07:36.347 --> 07:40.053
And that door is the door into the Widener Room.

07:40.073 --> 07:40.935
Or it always was.

07:41.496 --> 07:44.741
I've been there for 20 years, but that's where it is now.

07:44.761 --> 07:48.568
Of course, I went straight to the Reading Room with a computer.

07:48.953 --> 07:52.318
Uh, and maybe they only open at certain hours.

07:52.338 --> 08:03.857
I don't know, maybe they're... So the kids stole the Gutenberg Bible, and the Widener is built in a, uh, you know, it's an inner building, and then the courtyard, and then an outer curtain.

08:04.798 --> 08:14.153
And he, uh, was in the middle, in the Widener room, and he went out the window, he went down into the courtyard, and then up the wall, she'd go over, and then he fell.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.856
He had no Wideners?

08:15.876 --> 08:16.176
Yeah.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.697
What do I propose to do with him?

08:19.718 --> 08:23.123
Oh, he never recovered to tell us.

08:23.143 --> 08:23.604
Is he a student?

08:24.325 --> 08:24.586
No.

08:24.966 --> 08:25.808
He's a burglar.

08:26.789 --> 08:27.591
He's a foot.

08:27.991 --> 08:28.172
Yeah.

08:28.192 --> 08:35.484
And so Bill Bond's account is there in the, you know, the magazine that's published by Harvard for it.

08:35.504 --> 08:36.886
It's a nice magazine.

08:36.906 --> 08:37.287
It's wonderful.

08:37.307 --> 08:40.392
And it's, I forget what it's called, Harvard Magazine.

08:40.412 --> 08:42.636
And it was about two or a few years ago.

08:44.253 --> 08:46.176
And if you can't find it, let me find it.

08:46.196 --> 08:47.257
Well, you can find it.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.981
You've got people to find that for you.

08:50.001 --> 08:50.281
Oh, yeah.

08:50.301 --> 08:50.621
Sure.

08:51.402 --> 08:53.625
What I really need are the tips like you've given me.

08:53.806 --> 09:05.321
Well, then, the result of that was that the book was recovered, and the insurance company called all of the owners of Bloomberg Bibles and said that the rules are new now, and here are the rules.

09:05.681 --> 09:10.227
And the rules are that the insurance is going to cost you ten times what it needs to cost you.

09:10.595 --> 09:19.667
And you're going to have to keep it locked up in a vault or something.

09:19.687 --> 09:25.735
And Arthur owned a newspaper at that time.

09:25.755 --> 09:30.141
And he kept it for a couple of years, and then he just decided that it was no fun having those people show you a friend and enjoy it.

09:30.161 --> 09:36.390
And so it was sold to a dealer.

09:36.410 --> 09:36.951
Krauss bought it.

09:36.971 --> 09:38.813
Krauss bought it, and he stocked it for...

09:39.552 --> 09:43.537
He held it in stock for about five years, which is tough.

09:44.979 --> 09:50.827
And then eventually all of the goods and goods got sold in 1978.

09:51.428 --> 10:00.860
And I think at that time, Houghton began to think about what he was going to do with his collection.

10:00.880 --> 10:06.167
And he's a very astute man.

10:07.058 --> 10:15.425
He listened to his financial guidance, and looked at his whole estate was reorganized at that point.

10:16.086 --> 10:25.334
He had just finished building a house, and he gave it away, and built another house on the next acreage.

10:25.354 --> 10:31.159
And he gave his stud away to some kind of organization in Maryland.

10:31.199 --> 10:35.603
You know, he used to raise cattle in the advertising of New Yorkers.

10:35.623 --> 10:36.964
Wasn't he coining money?

10:37.298 --> 10:38.899
His family was corny.

10:38.939 --> 10:39.980
He was Stu Ben.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.305
He organized and created Stu Ben Brown on Fifth Avenue.

10:45.325 --> 11:00.319
And, you know, I think in setting up his finances at that point in his life, the decision was, hey, well, we need to liquidate that collection, and so we went off to prestige.

11:01.140 --> 11:06.124
Can you tell me how long you've spent a little bit about yourself and your work here?

11:07.032 --> 11:11.918
I've been here for almost 10 years.

11:13.620 --> 11:31.460
And before that, I was at the Library of Congress for a few years doing odd jobs, consulting, and then I was at the National Cathedral in Washington for about a few years before that.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.501
Speaking of Washington, there's a four-timer there.

11:32.521 --> 11:32.662
Walter.

11:32.902 --> 11:33.883
I hope you've seen it.

11:34.285 --> 11:36.188
He's invited me down.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.950
Oh, good.

11:38.371 --> 11:41.014
He's also very proud of his Moirier collection.

11:41.555 --> 11:42.537
Born by his father.

11:44.099 --> 11:48.805
His thing has been the Espy place.

11:48.865 --> 11:52.130
Which is an interesting collection, isn't it?

11:52.571 --> 11:56.456
In fact, I think he has a place at the Watergate just to house it.

11:57.037 --> 11:58.759
Well, I associate him with Watergate.

11:58.939 --> 12:00.782
I never forget the

12:02.197 --> 12:05.341
the day he showed up with a pistol strap to his belt.

12:05.961 --> 12:13.050
And when the riots were going on, he appointed himself security officer at the Watergate.

12:13.070 --> 12:14.832
Everybody says, I have to touch it.

12:14.852 --> 12:16.193
And I talked to him on the phone.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.436
And he said, well, I talked mow the air.

12:18.596 --> 12:23.142
He said, if I get mow the air, just let me know when you're coming down.

12:23.562 --> 12:25.685
I'm hoping to see Larry McMurtry, too.

12:25.705 --> 12:28.228
I think he'd be very interested.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.089
Oh, absolutely.

12:29.109 --> 12:31.191
So now you're getting a feel for the people

12:31.441 --> 12:54.529
Larry is a great bookman.

12:58.053 --> 12:59.195
Not at all.

13:00.697 --> 13:10.131
Oh, well, then I got a degree at Oxford in the middle of all of that, sort of in the English.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.335
So, but I'm not a collector.

13:12.355 --> 13:14.959
I just assist others.

13:16.181 --> 13:22.170
Do you work at all in acquisitions here?

13:22.190 --> 13:26.997
I make recommendations inside, but I do

13:28.023 --> 13:39.853
I mean, the main thrust here is modern contemporary literature, which is, for the most part, not terribly exciting, but it's easily acquired.

13:39.873 --> 13:49.501
I, you know, I bought, I recommended an acquisition at the garden sale.

13:49.521 --> 13:50.202
We got two of them.

13:52.043 --> 13:52.764
Oh, cool.

13:52.944 --> 13:57.388
We got the, uh, Croissart, Lot 41, which is beautiful.

13:58.178 --> 14:04.928
Well, you know, I would say the portfolios weren't all that exciting.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.373
Yeah, I'm talking to the buyer of them, by the way.

14:08.393 --> 14:09.735
I want you to know that.

14:10.155 --> 14:11.137
That's all right.

14:11.157 --> 14:11.938
Don't worry about it.

14:11.998 --> 14:15.723
You know, Krauss had them, in 1974, $165,000.

14:15.743 --> 14:18.287
No, I didn't know.

14:18.307 --> 14:22.012
They went from $165,000 to $2 million of the sales.

14:22.373 --> 14:25.317
That's a pretty good investment, if you want to tell the investment difference, isn't it?

14:25.702 --> 14:26.803
It certainly is.

14:26.823 --> 14:28.265
It's wonderful.

14:28.285 --> 14:28.765
Quite wonderful.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.848
No, and I don't mean to discourage us.

14:30.968 --> 14:35.353
The folios are the folios, and that's fine.

14:36.134 --> 14:42.140
I'm being picky because I don't like their modern west-end bindings.

14:42.221 --> 14:46.605
The books won't open and stay flat, or whatever it is.

14:46.625 --> 14:50.350
It's too bad they're not in there.

14:50.430 --> 14:52.452
But the same is true of our stuff.

14:52.870 --> 14:54.072
They're all in Riviera.

14:54.573 --> 15:01.043
I think what people don't realize is that, you know, rarity and scarcity are two different things.

15:01.064 --> 15:05.371
And the folio is not a particularly scarce book.

15:05.391 --> 15:08.075
But there are a lot of them.

15:08.095 --> 15:08.195
Sure.

15:08.215 --> 15:09.477
As rare books still.

15:09.497 --> 15:14.285
But Don Quixote, that one's a buck and a half.

15:14.345 --> 15:16.549
The estimate was 300,000.

15:17.086 --> 15:19.709
But there was not a copy of that book in Spain.

15:19.729 --> 15:21.791
Oh, is it going to Spain?

15:21.811 --> 15:32.262
It's going to the Spanish collector, whose identity I don't know, and I'm told if I press high enough, I can find out.

15:32.282 --> 15:37.147
The major Spanish private collector.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.109
There shouldn't be a copy of that.

15:39.810 --> 15:44.595
I think there were only six extra.

15:45.267 --> 15:53.101
So that, now that's a pretty scarce, pretty scarce.

15:53.121 --> 15:54.784
So when it went for a million and a half, you know.

15:54.804 --> 15:58.230
That's when I would say this is right where it should happen.

16:00.695 --> 16:02.398
Well, how do you feel now?

16:02.438 --> 16:09.250
The focus is 20th century.

16:11.086 --> 16:15.611
a lot of views, I guess, that are expanding the focus.

16:15.631 --> 16:16.292
I do.

16:16.392 --> 16:40.300
I think that the special collections of a major university that has over 50,000 students and a massive research faculty oriented toward research, one of the Pope or a student, cannot just narrowly focus exclusively in any area, although it must

16:41.528 --> 16:49.518
have its strength in an area, and that's what ours is.

16:49.538 --> 17:05.159
We have a young, new German professor who was hired from Yale, and he wants material to work within this library, and that should not be ignored.

17:05.179 --> 17:06.861
Of course, we have wonderful

17:11.178 --> 17:20.712
But I think you want to go back to the centuries as much as before 1900.

17:20.732 --> 17:28.223
I think what you're suggesting is that perhaps you should widen the scope to include.

17:28.263 --> 17:29.105
The scope is there.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.026
The emphasis is in the 20th century.

17:30.046 --> 17:35.614
We occasionally go to the garden sale when we can afford it.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.358
And we had some fun.

17:38.619 --> 17:39.480
We were able to buy.

17:40.135 --> 17:46.424
Now, did you do that yourself with your dealer?

17:46.444 --> 17:47.385
We went through an agency.

17:48.407 --> 17:53.234
We probably spoke through agents.

17:53.254 --> 17:54.736
Who did you use for that?

17:54.756 --> 17:55.177
Do you remember?

17:56.218 --> 17:58.041
Um, somebody in the East Coast.

17:58.061 --> 17:58.782
That's a good deal.

17:58.802 --> 18:05.031
Because you really don't want to tip off your head that it's Texas.

18:05.051 --> 18:05.311
That's right.

18:05.331 --> 18:05.772
Do things contentious.

18:06.528 --> 18:10.474
Put on my boots and get my hat and walk into Sotheby's.

18:10.894 --> 18:12.317
Say I'll bid on that.

18:12.357 --> 18:16.102
Where are you from?

18:16.603 --> 18:17.604
I grew up in Ohio.

18:17.624 --> 18:18.406
You mean where?

18:18.606 --> 18:21.210
Ohio, in the Middle West.

18:21.630 --> 18:35.050
I went to Hanover College, which is Indiana.

18:36.413 --> 18:46.047
I started after 10 years or so, 15 years, I went over to Oxford and studied to do that.

18:46.067 --> 18:46.968
And that's it.

18:46.988 --> 18:53.017
A question I've asked other people who are new to the 80s.

18:53.037 --> 18:54.098
Are you an assimilated Texan?

18:54.118 --> 18:55.680
Yeah, I am.

18:55.941 --> 18:57.002
I like it very much.

18:58.244 --> 18:59.706
And I was very surprised.

18:59.886 --> 19:04.513
My eastern view of Texas before I came in was very,

19:05.455 --> 19:17.749
Well, first of all, I was amazingly uninformed about this place.

19:17.769 --> 19:25.657
Considering that I was in the business, I had no real understanding about what was here in this library.

19:25.677 --> 19:26.778
And most people don't.

19:26.959 --> 19:30.923
I mean, they realize that there's a lot of good modern literature, I'm sure.

19:32.101 --> 19:38.687
And, uh, I suppose they know that it would be the survival here, but all the other, you know, parsons.

19:38.707 --> 19:42.030
Uh, and, you know, and the geography of the place.

19:42.050 --> 19:52.919
I, of course, thought of it, the landscape of the Panhandle, and all of that, and, uh, all of the population that goes with that.

19:52.939 --> 19:59.985
Um, the summer tree, uh, last picture show.

20:00.005 --> 20:02.007
Okay, and here I am in this luscious

20:02.240 --> 20:08.347
Hill Country with a river going through and a clean new building.

20:09.328 --> 20:15.074
And it was a booming economy in the U.S.

20:15.094 --> 20:15.314
area.

20:15.655 --> 20:19.078
The only thing I find irritating is the great teaching.

20:19.098 --> 20:26.226
The lack of art and the vast universal community.

20:26.246 --> 20:26.887
How are the professionals?

20:26.907 --> 20:29.229
Are you stimulated by this?

20:29.249 --> 20:30.351
Very.

20:30.371 --> 20:31.572
And there's a lot of activity.

20:32.075 --> 20:43.009
in relation to the collections.

20:43.029 --> 20:51.559
We're not just sitting here in isolation.

20:51.579 --> 20:52.060
People come and go here.

20:52.080 --> 20:56.065
We're, you know, we have a series of people giving lectures in relation to us through the spring right now.

20:58.288 --> 21:00.310
And there's a constant interaction professionally with the world of lives, helping people to publish.

21:01.049 --> 21:19.307
You came after the great boom, the window of opportunity.

21:19.327 --> 21:24.832
Well, I was here for four times, which was a lot of money.

21:24.852 --> 21:29.537
And one might say that the boom was only just ended.

21:31.272 --> 21:36.479
The first time it was, what, 86?

21:36.780 --> 21:38.562
86, yeah.

21:38.582 --> 21:42.668
You're right.

21:42.688 --> 21:52.382
That really did bring a stamp, didn't it?

21:52.402 --> 22:00.032
I've heard the... One person has described a phrase that went around here as a quest for instant ideas.

22:00.052 --> 22:00.553
Oh, sure.

22:01.428 --> 22:05.933
But that's an old idea for us.

22:05.953 --> 22:13.903
That goes back 30 or 40 years, and the whole history of the HRC is covered with that kind of printing.

22:13.923 --> 22:27.199
If you look at the letters that were written to T. Belles by Hayward in the 60s about us, that's expressed there.

22:27.871 --> 22:37.505
I mean, treasures from Great Britain have been crossing the Atlantic for years.

22:37.866 --> 22:38.387
Oh, sure.

22:38.567 --> 22:38.847
J.P.

22:38.887 --> 22:39.428
Morgan.

22:39.448 --> 22:40.950
He had a better sense of PR.

22:42.032 --> 22:45.437
You got Alice in Wonderland and gave it back.

22:45.517 --> 22:46.479
You're talking about Rosenbach.

22:46.799 --> 22:47.480
Rosenbach.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.224
But Morgan, didn't Morgan have something to do with it?

22:50.244 --> 22:51.346
I don't know.

22:51.466 --> 22:52.788
He gave something back.

22:52.808 --> 22:54.571
He bought something and gave it back.

22:54.591 --> 22:54.891
I think he did.

22:56.103 --> 22:58.146
I mean, that's a nice sense of P.I.

22:58.166 --> 23:00.068
That might endear you a little bit.

23:00.669 --> 23:09.420
But the British were particularly... You should listen to Turner on this subject, Tom's predecessor.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.043
How does one reach this?

23:12.103 --> 23:15.888
You have to write him a note, or swing by.

23:16.448 --> 23:19.152
Where did he write?

23:19.172 --> 23:21.775
He lives on a street called Crickley Care.

23:22.255 --> 23:24.338
Crickley Care.

23:25.178 --> 23:27.400
But I think the courteous thing is a note.

23:29.983 --> 23:37.230
And he would be a great, you should interview him.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.616
Mention my name.

23:43.636 --> 23:44.898
4215.

23:44.938 --> 23:46.599
4215, prickly pear.

23:46.619 --> 23:46.799
78731.

23:46.819 --> 23:51.284
78731, that's his phone number?

23:51.944 --> 23:52.485
No phone.

23:54.608 --> 23:55.949
What is this?

23:56.430 --> 24:00.134
You mean no phone known?

24:00.214 --> 24:06.060
No, but he has a phone, but he doesn't give it out locally, only to his friends.

24:06.080 --> 24:11.426
This suggests an acrimonious departure.

24:11.506 --> 24:22.658
I think it does, and yet there's probably some proven suggestion, but the fact is he has deliberately chosen to

24:23.245 --> 24:40.627
to cut the connection and not have to deal with the ongoing activity in the HRC and not take part in, let's say, not take a Mendelsohn role in relation to the HRC as well.

24:40.787 --> 24:47.135
You did the same thing about the FND in 1980.

24:47.155 --> 24:52.442
You really stopped, you know, and I think when you get the scene, you'll refer to

24:53.063 --> 24:59.250
as kind of paving his career when the person he replaced didn't leave.

25:00.192 --> 25:05.658
Well, I think he's the one who coined the phrase, the ransom signal, isn't he?

25:05.678 --> 25:05.778
Yeah.

25:05.798 --> 25:07.060
What do you think he meant by that?

25:07.080 --> 25:13.147
Oh, you'll have to ask him.

25:13.267 --> 25:13.688
Good answer.

25:13.768 --> 25:15.490
That's an explanation.

25:15.530 --> 25:16.671
You won't touch that one.

25:16.691 --> 25:19.054
Well, I think it should be fair to Deckard Turner.

25:19.338 --> 25:23.983
But when it was thrown around, I mean, what was the reaction to it?

25:24.003 --> 25:29.868
Well, what did people think he used to write when he was thrown around?

25:29.888 --> 25:31.149
Nobody really replaced it, if that's what you mean.

25:31.290 --> 25:31.490
Yeah.

25:32.351 --> 25:33.352
But he wrote about this.

25:35.974 --> 25:36.114
Yes.

25:36.134 --> 25:38.877
But where might he have written about it?

25:38.997 --> 25:42.320
He issued a series of occasional notes called HRC notes.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.144
Maybe we'll find some of them right here.

25:46.164 --> 25:49.227
There's some right here, if you want to check into the reading room.

25:50.708 --> 25:56.774
It looked too late.

25:57.134 --> 26:05.702
I'm surprised they haven't mentioned to you, because they did call sometime there was... Who would have mentioned them to me?

26:05.722 --> 26:06.002
Booksellers.

26:06.022 --> 26:11.708
Not local, but not the HSC notes, though.

26:11.728 --> 26:16.372
They would have been published periodically during this tenure?

26:16.392 --> 26:16.732
No.

26:16.932 --> 26:17.593
They never even thought about it.

26:18.029 --> 26:19.831
What were they?

26:20.051 --> 26:43.894
They were, at various levels of organization, they were striking up his thoughts and things about the HRC, about , about classes of literature.

26:44.055 --> 26:46.517
And he was always willing to say what he thought about.

26:47.712 --> 26:50.735
Has he described the ranking syndrome?

26:50.755 --> 26:55.521
If that's what you need to get a hold of it.

26:55.661 --> 27:00.346
Well, I'd like to say, just to get a sense.

27:00.446 --> 27:03.349
I mean, he does fit into the continuum.

27:03.369 --> 27:04.731
Oh, it's important.

27:04.751 --> 27:05.672
And it's important.

27:05.812 --> 27:09.737
And it's been suggested, perhaps, that maybe he was a person for his job.

27:14.562 --> 27:17.365
He just couldn't fit in with the scheme.

27:17.682 --> 27:27.815
the program, which was established and set in motion, and by and large, successful.

27:27.955 --> 27:32.421
I mean, we were sitting surrounded by a successful event like that.

27:32.561 --> 27:36.245
What was your perception of what was going on here at Texas?

27:36.265 --> 27:44.736
Not the perception of Texas, per se, that was one idea in terms of acquisition, in terms of what the British might describe as a frenzy of that.

27:45.728 --> 28:03.850
Well, your question is about Turner, or is it about the HRC?

28:03.871 --> 28:04.852
Yeah, it's about the HRC.

28:05.352 --> 28:13.963
Well, I think the allegation of indiscriminate politically has some kind of

28:14.416 --> 28:36.333
And you must understand that the man that created this book was a tremendous catalytic idea-theist, and not so much an organizer, a methodical administrator.

28:38.978 --> 28:39.799
Tremendous power.

28:41.213 --> 29:06.495
And the idea, you know, I want to make a center where the humanities can be studied in the broadest sense, which meant that at one point the people in the humanities, I told you, in the center were given the administrative control of every painted canvas in the university.

29:07.808 --> 29:14.756
That was, you know, and that was because Ransom decided that that was part of the mandate of what we wanted here.

29:15.217 --> 29:23.527
When I arrived here, there was a collection of Alaskan screen-draw carvings, whatever it's called.

29:23.727 --> 29:25.069
Okay.

29:25.089 --> 29:25.950
Beautiful.

29:25.970 --> 29:31.256
And very valuable.

29:31.296 --> 29:36.022
When I arrived here, the... Still here?

29:36.102 --> 29:36.162
No.

29:36.378 --> 29:36.879
Oh, no.

29:37.259 --> 29:38.420
It's where it should be.

29:38.460 --> 29:39.181
It's in the museum.

29:40.663 --> 29:42.024
It was here in the library.

29:42.184 --> 29:43.025
Yeah, it was upstairs.

29:44.327 --> 29:47.210
Part of our Alaskan collection.

29:47.230 --> 29:48.071
Okay.

29:48.091 --> 29:50.313
Did they make money for that collection, did you think?

29:50.333 --> 29:53.376
That was a, I think that was a gift.

29:53.396 --> 29:56.260
But there were collections that were purchased.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.683
We were given another collection of patent models.

30:01.726 --> 30:02.166
Okay.

30:03.142 --> 30:04.304
Oh, they're fascinating.

30:04.404 --> 30:05.225
Patent models.

30:05.486 --> 30:22.592
Until 1922, when the system was changed, in order to acquire a patent on your invention, you were required to provide a miniature model of your invention and let or show why you couldn't.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.513
I think that was interesting.

30:23.746 --> 30:26.250
Well, they have a whole series of Smithsonian.

30:26.270 --> 30:30.176
Well, the point is that they ended up with warehouses full of the models.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.540
In 1922, they said, let's forget the model.

30:32.940 --> 30:35.244
We'll just have the lawyers and the papers.

30:35.264 --> 30:37.087
And then they got rid of them.

30:37.107 --> 30:44.258
And I think I counted seven different groups owned that collection in the intervening years.

30:44.959 --> 30:49.045
Each one acquiring it with the idea that they're fortunate to be made.

30:49.683 --> 30:53.947
and each one being defeated by the inventory and, you know, controlling.

30:53.987 --> 30:54.668
What is it?

30:54.688 --> 30:56.069
What are you going to sell?

30:56.169 --> 30:57.250
Oh, I want it.

30:57.410 --> 30:59.052
Where's the washing machine?

30:59.072 --> 30:59.573
I want a washing machine.

30:59.593 --> 31:02.035
You know, not being able to find it, whatever.

31:02.055 --> 31:11.744
And eventually, two young men gave us a thousand of them, dreaming that we would then want the rest of them.

31:11.764 --> 31:17.530
And so they kicked around here for a number of years until Turner and I

31:18.944 --> 31:23.930
got rid of them right now and he's here.

31:24.972 --> 31:29.558
There are other collections which are perhaps marginally more justifiable.

31:29.658 --> 31:33.623
There's a collection of maps.

31:33.643 --> 31:34.143
Okay.

31:34.163 --> 31:35.886
They're beautiful.

31:37.007 --> 31:40.171
They're certainly a humanity subject, all right?

31:40.431 --> 31:42.434
It's not scientific as well.

31:44.637 --> 31:48.782
But in this library, there are only, let's say, a hundred such maps.

31:49.353 --> 31:52.497
And it's not a map collection.

31:52.517 --> 31:54.720
There's no depth there.

31:54.840 --> 31:59.065
It doesn't constitute a real research tool.

31:59.085 --> 32:08.497
The most it constitutes is the occasional letter that I get saying, I know that you have the Portland Atlas of the west coast of Africa.

32:08.517 --> 32:09.899
I need to study it.

32:09.999 --> 32:11.461
And that's it.

32:11.541 --> 32:16.146
So perhaps that should not have been purchased.

32:16.166 --> 32:18.229
No, was it purchased?

32:18.682 --> 32:25.332
on its own merits, or part of a life that made it kind of come in the net, so to speak.

32:25.352 --> 32:26.574
It came in the net.

32:26.594 --> 32:33.364
Oh yes, we're going to, you know, the thinking was, we're going to collect nets, and we're going to have a significant net collection, and we're going to start by buying this.

32:33.384 --> 32:37.049
So we have these targets of opportunity, shall we say.

32:37.069 --> 32:37.270
Yeah.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.411
Fire away.

32:38.431 --> 32:40.675
Fire away.

32:40.695 --> 32:44.881
But then again, if you're starting from ground zero, I mean, I can't drop that entirely.

32:44.901 --> 32:47.505
They're very, it's very nice to have those nets.

32:47.525 --> 32:47.625
Yeah.

32:48.280 --> 32:53.167
But you can't... I mean, we've grown up now.

32:53.247 --> 32:54.088
We can't do that.

32:54.829 --> 32:59.336
There isn't enough money, not to mention the base, to collect that way.

33:00.497 --> 33:05.604
You've got to decide... If something's going to give them to us, that's one thing.

33:05.624 --> 33:18.102
But if you're going to take the precious dollars, which are limited, very, very limited, and every year you turn down 80% of what you want,

33:18.723 --> 33:20.546
because you can't buy.

33:20.566 --> 33:24.812
Do you think in the beginning they turned down 80%?

33:25.432 --> 33:25.673
No.

33:25.833 --> 33:30.580
In the beginning, they budgeted half a million dollars a year.

33:31.541 --> 33:36.047
Well, no, I'm talking about what was budgeted in the day.

33:36.288 --> 33:43.498
In actual spending, it was a couple of million dollars a year.

33:43.518 --> 33:44.119
And that's just the statement.

33:44.139 --> 33:48.204
And then you had the benefactors, the most generous.

33:48.285 --> 33:48.645
The food.

33:49.216 --> 33:51.138
But that's an area I don't know about.

33:51.538 --> 33:53.000
You'll have to get that somewhere else.

33:53.601 --> 33:54.702
But that's fine.

33:54.742 --> 33:58.366
I don't see the history of manufacturers here that you mentioned.

33:58.386 --> 34:01.109
Well, there's a piece in the New York Times, and I start with that.

34:01.129 --> 34:06.074
It's the first mention of Harry Ransom in the New York Times index.

34:06.094 --> 34:06.895
It was January 1, 1973.

34:06.915 --> 34:08.637
First time there's a profile of them.

34:08.657 --> 34:10.138
And the index, it may be.

34:10.158 --> 34:15.424
And I was talking to Alan Gribben, who's doing the biography of Ransom, and I said, have you found anything wrong with it?

34:15.464 --> 34:16.405
He said, no, that's the earliest.

34:17.144 --> 34:38.894
You know, and he's doing the biography, so, you know, Harry Ransom had been at it for 15 years by the time the Times got around to writing a profile about him, and the occasion for this was the purchase of the Maximilian letters, which meant the three noses out of shape, because they didn't even know they were on the market, and all of a sudden Texas got it for almost $25,000.

34:38.915 --> 34:44.282
But in that Times piece, which I brought a copy of, it's in my briefcase,

34:44.836 --> 35:03.201
It says, in 15 years, Texas has spent $45 million on acquisitions, 30 million of which... 30 million of which... What does that mean?

35:03.221 --> 35:06.746
You're reading on-site sources of manufacturing.

35:06.926 --> 35:08.728
I would read it.

35:08.889 --> 35:13.695
Well, maybe that means some other fund that the university might have.

35:14.283 --> 35:24.623
like what's called the permanent university.

35:24.643 --> 35:24.723
Hmm.

35:24.743 --> 35:24.943
Ask Allen?

35:24.963 --> 35:25.024
No.

35:25.044 --> 35:26.226
No, I mean, I was driven.

35:27.188 --> 35:27.508
Yeah, driven.

35:27.528 --> 35:29.793
I think we asked him now.

35:29.813 --> 35:30.975
But anyways.

35:31.293 --> 35:32.975
I don't want to split here.

35:32.995 --> 35:34.837
Well, and I'm not making an issue out of this.

35:34.917 --> 35:37.200
It's just that I can't name names.

35:37.420 --> 35:38.241
I'm not either.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.363
I can't name names.

35:39.383 --> 35:48.514
And one of the things, one of the characteristics of this institution and its growth is that there aren't benefactors standing around very much.

35:48.534 --> 35:53.560
You know, most of the acquisitions that I know about are purchases.

35:54.201 --> 35:54.381
Really?

35:54.421 --> 35:58.126
Yeah, in my time, the only big major deal was in Seattle.

35:58.146 --> 35:59.207
It was a wonderful game.

35:59.440 --> 36:16.844
Of course I know that Mr. Perot was left there.

36:16.864 --> 36:20.088
No.

36:20.108 --> 36:23.113
Mr. Perot lent us the money for 4th.

36:23.133 --> 36:23.353
He lent us?

36:23.373 --> 36:23.473
Yeah.

36:23.493 --> 36:24.074
I thought he'd take it, no?

36:24.094 --> 36:24.314
Yeah.

36:24.454 --> 36:25.516
So that's not a gift from Mr. Perot.

36:25.536 --> 36:26.177
So that money's being paid back?

36:26.197 --> 36:26.297
Yeah.

36:26.317 --> 36:26.597
With interest?

36:26.617 --> 36:27.118
No, it was interest.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.638
That money has been paid back, and there have been gifts.

36:30.658 --> 36:32.539
You're right, and I like to acknowledge that.

36:32.559 --> 36:45.971
There have been gifts for portions of it, like $6 million, which is not inconsiderable, which is significant.

36:45.991 --> 36:57.662
But for the most part, our acquisitions, my understanding of our acquisitions, and I'm not the first to ask this person, but my understanding is that they would have been paid with some kind of funding

36:58.351 --> 37:01.915
whether it's in the budget or not in Syria.

37:01.995 --> 37:09.502
Which makes it, to me, all the more impressive that you kept that kind of a mandate for the state legislature.

37:09.522 --> 37:14.607
You know, up in Massachusetts, we can't even get him to get a personal crisis up there.

37:14.667 --> 37:15.828
What is your schedule like?

37:15.848 --> 37:18.791
Are you off for lunch or something like that at this point?

37:18.811 --> 37:20.593
I'm supposed to be somewhere else.

37:21.474 --> 37:23.356
But I don't want to end it.

37:23.376 --> 37:24.056
Have you come back?

37:24.236 --> 37:25.658
It's been delightful.

37:25.778 --> 37:26.839
I'd like to...

37:28.000 --> 37:33.188
Why don't you go send a postcard or FedEx to Turner?

37:33.689 --> 37:36.754
Well, if I have to come back, I will, you know.

37:36.954 --> 37:40.900
I think that he's a major person who takes a collection.

37:40.920 --> 37:50.515
I've asked a couple times how I can get in touch with him.

37:50.536 --> 37:53.400
Well, I have no way to get the phone number for you.

37:58.392 --> 38:26.830
They're an isolated gem that they aren't... Well, the point I'd make about the Maximilian one is that they're a wonderful isolated gem of manuscript material, but they don't form a part of what we're recognized for in terms of a body of strong materials, which is the 19th and 20th century American, British, and French literature.

38:28.362 --> 38:32.766
But nevertheless, you know, if the material's there, it's available for use and things.

38:32.786 --> 38:46.438
And the kind of uses that are made of the manuscript collections, I think, might be particularly interesting.

38:46.458 --> 38:51.603
Well, I think there are any number of books, I mean, 50 or 60 years.

38:51.623 --> 38:53.185
I don't remember, but quite an impressive number of books published each year.

38:53.205 --> 38:53.525
Yeah, per annum.

38:53.545 --> 38:54.185
Directly.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.107
We haven't got that list yet.

38:56.127 --> 38:56.968
Someone's supposed to give us that list.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.217
Can I have this for me?

38:59.237 --> 39:11.709
Yes, that's a list of books and dissertations published out of research done with our manuscript holding since we began teaching records like that.

39:11.790 --> 39:14.132
How current is that?

39:14.753 --> 39:27.225
This published version dates from 1983, and I have a separate accumulation for 84 through now.

39:28.184 --> 39:31.389
No, it's just on a database.

39:31.449 --> 39:41.405
It's just information I compile as books and monographs come in for our annual report.

39:41.725 --> 39:42.286
Pardon?

39:42.366 --> 39:44.850
Do you ever do a printout?

39:44.950 --> 39:48.997
Yeah, I can do a printout for you.

39:49.017 --> 39:50.879
This is what it's all about.

39:51.861 --> 39:55.086
This is what collecting is all about.

39:56.011 --> 40:09.108
But you can use that booklet, for example, to determine which of our collections are most heavily used in terms of publication results.

40:09.128 --> 40:18.720
And you can also get a handle on which scholars have come back to the Center over and over and over again for one publication after another.

40:18.740 --> 40:24.347
I think Stanley Weintraub holds the record for scholar-making.

40:24.597 --> 40:29.664
the heaviest use of our holdings that has resulted in publications.

40:29.684 --> 40:30.826
And the D.H.

40:30.846 --> 40:37.074
Lawrence collection is our single most heavily used collection.

40:37.094 --> 40:42.962
And to the extent that it's a gauge at all, the long list of publications under D.H.

40:43.102 --> 40:47.108
Lawrence is really quite impressive.

40:47.128 --> 40:48.630
And I would like to bring in Poland.

40:49.471 --> 40:52.075
I mean, you have a few books on it.

40:52.095 --> 40:53.437
It's behind glass very well there.

40:53.457 --> 40:55.760
The problematics, what comes to mind.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.322
On the third floor, uh-huh.

40:57.342 --> 40:57.442
Yeah.

40:58.444 --> 41:04.572
And my book will be published, we hope, next year.

41:04.592 --> 41:04.732
Uh-huh.

41:04.752 --> 41:13.104
And I would like to make it as current as I can.

41:13.124 --> 41:13.465
Yeah.

41:13.485 --> 41:15.107
That's no big problem.

41:15.127 --> 41:18.752
The reason I mentioned Maximilian, I appreciate that that reflects

41:19.340 --> 41:35.238
But it is interesting, in terms of the fact that it did occasion this piece in the New York Times, which represented the first time that Dr. Ransom was profiled in the New York Times.

41:35.258 --> 41:37.180
And I driven to confirm that.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.082
I said, did you find anything earlier than that?

41:39.102 --> 41:41.045
He said, no, that's the first thing.

41:41.065 --> 41:43.187
So for 15 years, he had been very quietly

41:43.555 --> 41:50.085
Not so quietly, but he finally did get the attention of the New York Times in 1973, the occasion was this.

41:50.646 --> 41:55.913
I think he probably attracted the attention of the London Times, sooner than that.

41:55.953 --> 41:58.097
Without any question.

41:58.117 --> 42:03.184
Yeah, but the American collecting community didn't fully recognize it.

42:03.204 --> 42:11.757
And I am going to try and capture some of the flavor of these pioneer days, which I guess is what I'm going to describe here in Texas.

42:12.378 --> 42:37.305
I don't know if I'll be able to help you out there.

42:38.028 --> 42:42.112
You're going to need to get that approval from Tom's name.

42:42.232 --> 42:43.614
Okay, I'm just seeing it at two 50s.

42:43.634 --> 42:58.349
Yeah, and the other handicap you're working on there, which if it were material cataloged into the collections, is that I could not photocopy any for you, so you would supply an authorization from the copyright.

42:58.369 --> 42:59.531
That's part of the rule.

42:59.651 --> 43:02.854
You might be interested just to look over

43:05.281 --> 43:14.734
All of these we've set up for the Museum of Amos for collections, and those will be changed slightly.

43:14.894 --> 43:18.599
But Dr. Staley, did you take quotes from the letters?

43:19.200 --> 43:19.901
Yeah.

43:19.921 --> 43:25.649
About several letters, and that is being published.

43:27.812 --> 43:27.912
Yeah.

43:27.932 --> 43:29.394
And there it's been published.

43:29.414 --> 43:29.514
Okay.

43:29.534 --> 43:32.939
Yeah, but they'll all have to get proof.

43:32.959 --> 43:34.982
Maybe I will too.

43:35.002 --> 43:35.102
Yeah.

43:35.302 --> 43:37.365
before using it?

43:37.385 --> 43:52.065
Well, for the reason I want Dr. Staley's authority to supply you copies from our collection files is purely an administrative one.

43:52.085 --> 44:04.482
And then I just segued into if you were requesting copies from our catalog names for collections, our policy would require me first to have you obtained

44:04.816 --> 44:21.001
written authorization for better duplications from the author of the manuscript he wrote twice to be copied or from that author's literary executor or the person who has inherited the copyright back to that person.

44:21.141 --> 44:25.387
And in the cases of Ransom, Schwartz, and Feldman, all of these people are dead.

44:25.407 --> 44:32.578
Well, that Harry Ransom's literary interest, his copyrights, would be retained by his widow.

44:33.470 --> 45:02.008
And because we're dealing with a large body of literary manuscript material that has a large commercial potential in some instances, we've taken this extra step of protecting the copyright holder's interest against the scholars' interest in gleaning information from the material as sort of a balance between our responsibilities

45:02.697 --> 45:12.873
to the people who entrust this material to our care and the scholarly community for him, for his use, for collections.

45:12.893 --> 45:16.458
So if I want to do some research here, I really have to come and see you.

45:16.478 --> 45:18.421
I'm not talking about that, right?

45:18.742 --> 45:19.603
Yes, yeah.

45:20.104 --> 45:27.315
Request to work with HRC Manus for pulling to come through this office.

45:27.335 --> 45:28.857
And I handle all the paperwork and prize people

45:29.208 --> 45:36.999
about what the nature of our holdings do and how they can find their best practices.

45:37.299 --> 45:49.216
And we get about 350 new requests each year to use our manuscript holdings.

45:49.236 --> 45:57.487
And these are for serious research projects as opposed to people coming in and being interested in a certain body because it's simply out of a personal interest.

45:57.507 --> 45:59.029
It's a favorite author or they just want to see someone hanging out.

45:59.836 --> 46:27.463
And we do, while we encourage people who want to use large quantities of materials or who are working on very broadly defined projects to come here to conduct their initial research, we will make photocopies of selected items available on loan for as long as someone needs them for their research according to the procedures I outlined to you earlier.

46:28.675 --> 46:38.087
So we tried to meet the needs of the scholarly community at a number of different levels.

46:40.710 --> 46:49.141
Okay, I can quickly pull the Maximilian Carlotta letters for you, or at least a folder of them, and you can look at them.

46:49.161 --> 46:51.785
I really don't want you to do a major treatment.

46:51.945 --> 46:52.205
I know.

46:52.225 --> 46:56.050
It's just that I'd like to be able to say it's 15 years later.

46:56.502 --> 47:04.149
Yeah, they're here, and they've been published from by an Italian publisher in Trieste.

47:04.389 --> 47:07.812
Or a portion of them that dealt with, that had to do with Trieste.

47:07.832 --> 47:11.495
Yeah, I'm interested in more and how they got here.

47:11.515 --> 47:11.935
Oh, okay.

47:12.396 --> 47:22.384
Well, that information's in the collection files.

47:22.404 --> 47:25.547
I can probably get that for you in a second.

47:31.197 --> 47:42.368
You do quote, which is wonderful, you quote Harry Ransom, a letter from Harry Ransom, Jake Schwartz.

47:42.388 --> 47:43.209
Yeah, Jake Schwartz.

47:43.229 --> 47:45.211
And there's some Lou Feldman stuff in there.

47:46.052 --> 47:48.094
Oh, there's a line about Lou Feldman.

47:48.735 --> 47:48.835
Yeah.

47:49.736 --> 48:00.086
I did ask Kathy, if it were possible, to get a, you know, I'm looking at perhaps, in my book, perhaps 30 pages on Texas.

48:00.146 --> 48:01.187
That's a lot.

48:01.842 --> 48:05.786
for a 400-page book, a 100,000-word book, which is what I'm learning.

48:05.806 --> 48:16.375
So, I mean, obviously, I'm not doing a major research investigation, shall we say, of the early days of the formation of the university.

48:16.395 --> 48:19.798
But I really would like to get a little bit of a flavor of the stuff.

48:19.899 --> 48:24.743
And boy, some of those letters that you quote there are really excellent.

48:24.763 --> 48:28.206
Would it be any problem for me to get access to any of these?

48:28.226 --> 48:31.309
Well, you have to understand, there are two different kinds of things that the HRC

48:31.559 --> 48:33.441
Those letters are not in the HRC collection.

48:33.461 --> 48:35.363
They're in the director's file.

48:35.383 --> 48:37.304
But I don't see any problem with quoting that letter.

48:37.404 --> 48:41.548
Plus, there are probably two or three others I could get you that would be of interest.

48:41.568 --> 48:43.250
But they're not up in the library.

48:43.290 --> 48:44.371
They're in my library.

48:44.391 --> 48:46.012
I don't need them today.

48:46.333 --> 48:47.894
If this is something... Which one do you want?

48:48.555 --> 48:49.956
You want that one?

48:49.976 --> 48:50.557
I might agree.

48:50.577 --> 48:52.078
So you've got that one quoted there.

48:52.098 --> 48:55.201
Yeah, well... I'll tell you what you really ought to look at.

48:55.321 --> 48:59.625
You know what I quote is that wonderful

49:00.382 --> 49:04.567
business of Carter's taste and technique and book writing.

49:04.687 --> 49:05.267
You got that?

49:05.708 --> 49:07.710
Make sure you have the second edition.

49:07.730 --> 49:08.431
The second edition?

49:08.451 --> 49:12.175
Well, the second edition is the one where he brings it all up today in the epilogue.

49:12.215 --> 49:15.919
People forget that book.

49:16.039 --> 49:21.365
I'll tell you, the collection I put together, those are in his lectures in 42, weren't they?

49:21.385 --> 49:30.034
But the big, the most interesting thing is what happened since 42 or 46, whatever date, taste and collection comes out.

49:30.267 --> 49:32.669
There's a second edition, covered by Cambridge.

49:32.689 --> 49:36.994
It's not a second edition, it's a second impression with an addenda.

49:37.014 --> 49:46.923
And that's the code, where a lot of what I got about the British attitude toward the American institutions is in there.

49:46.943 --> 49:48.765
So the appendix of the case will tell you.

49:49.406 --> 49:49.526
Yeah.

49:49.546 --> 49:51.268
Harvard's got it, no problem.

49:51.508 --> 49:51.828
OK.

49:52.088 --> 49:54.531
I was going to give you a full reference, but you can get it.

49:54.551 --> 49:55.672
Sure.

49:55.792 --> 49:56.793
I may even have a second.

49:56.813 --> 49:57.254
OK.

49:57.274 --> 49:58.755
If you had a second, then you got what's in there.

49:59.090 --> 50:05.016
All I need to know is that I'm doing a lot of work with Widen.

50:05.437 --> 50:09.241
I really would like a flavor.

50:09.541 --> 50:17.931
I have no wish or desire to examine the whole file on the film like Jake Schwartz.

50:18.311 --> 50:18.771
Gene?

50:20.413 --> 50:20.794
Gene?

50:23.637 --> 50:26.460
Could you ask Jennifer to bring in my ransom file?

50:27.381 --> 50:28.422
I mean, files.

50:29.313 --> 50:36.741
Yeah, they're just very ransomed correspondents.

50:36.881 --> 50:50.776
I think that I haven't, in the last two days, put together an excellent overview of... Well, hold on, I mean, I told Ray to just get around to whatever you could get around and see.

50:50.796 --> 50:51.977
Well, what did we do, sorry?

50:51.997 --> 50:53.018
Good, good.

50:53.038 --> 50:55.200
About seven or eight hours of tape.

50:55.220 --> 50:56.822
I can't put my dog.

50:57.376 --> 50:58.677
Well, these people can't go on.

50:58.738 --> 51:00.119
Carlton was wonderful.

51:00.139 --> 51:01.100
Oh, he's good.

51:01.120 --> 51:01.581
Yeah.

51:01.801 --> 51:02.362
He's a pro.

51:03.143 --> 51:03.703
Wonderful.

51:03.723 --> 51:04.865
What a story.

51:04.885 --> 51:05.525
Wonderful pro.

51:05.625 --> 51:07.868
He didn't want to be taped, which is good.

51:07.888 --> 51:08.809
He's all about it.

51:08.829 --> 51:10.871
He said, I'm a writer.

51:10.931 --> 51:12.313
He feels very tough to me.

51:12.413 --> 51:12.994
That was fine.

51:13.014 --> 51:14.816
And at the end, I said, well, thank you.

51:14.856 --> 51:18.640
You've now saved me the time of transcribing this one.

51:18.680 --> 51:19.842
He was delightful.

51:19.862 --> 51:23.426
And again, he gave a first-hand account.

51:23.506 --> 51:25.408
Now, here's a guy from Boston.

51:27.160 --> 51:36.472
Everything that's correct says that his collection probably should have gone to Boston University, though, and this is Boston University .

51:36.492 --> 51:39.976
Yet, he chose to come here.

51:40.677 --> 51:41.538
I mean, gave you good reasons.

51:41.678 --> 51:42.419
So that's fine.

51:42.459 --> 51:46.664
Don't you think there's a big difference between us, the other day?

51:46.684 --> 51:48.467
Well, there's a difference between the two.

51:48.487 --> 51:53.573
Yeah, I mean, I just, you're writing a book on this, so I hope you, I mean, I'm not, I mean, I'm,

51:55.004 --> 52:24.943
okay we're talking about the glorious ones that suggested that you paid the assertion that she paid a million dollars for that he put me on it he said he paid about a tenth of that yeah that was a thousand yeah i wonder where he's uh i know that it matters but

52:25.447 --> 52:30.934
It's part of the myth, I guess.

52:30.954 --> 52:32.617
The method, the idea.

52:32.657 --> 52:32.997
Yeah.

52:34.319 --> 52:45.474
Of a bottomless bit of money.

52:45.694 --> 52:54.947
And I guess the suggestion is that if she couldn't exist, the country's million bucks.

52:56.311 --> 52:56.751
or whatever.

52:56.771 --> 52:57.612
I don't know what it suggests.

52:57.632 --> 52:58.173
I suppose.

52:58.273 --> 52:58.713
I don't know.

52:58.973 --> 53:00.255
I can't interpret it either.

53:00.675 --> 53:02.356
It might have been he simply lost a zero.

53:02.456 --> 53:04.058
I don't know.

53:04.118 --> 53:06.360
No, we think I read the quotes.

53:06.380 --> 53:10.083
It was published by Bostonian, his own by Boston University.

53:10.163 --> 53:11.785
That magazine that... Oh, is it?

53:11.805 --> 53:15.248
It was published in... Silver Day credit.

53:15.288 --> 53:18.110
You know the history of that magazine?

53:19.051 --> 53:25.457
I mean, he... If I can see some of the things that...

53:25.758 --> 53:30.004
Not only what you quote here, but if there's any other, you know, you make the choice.

53:31.786 --> 53:34.490
Something that will really give me a... Before you leave, remind Ray.

53:35.011 --> 53:35.551
Okay.

53:35.571 --> 53:37.714
Because he really keeps track of that.

53:37.734 --> 53:37.835
Okay.

53:37.875 --> 53:43.903
Something that will show that I, you know, indicate that I have something.

53:43.923 --> 53:45.225
That I've done my work.

53:45.245 --> 53:46.506
Sure.

53:46.526 --> 53:50.332
Obviously, if you want to, if you will, allow me to go through the whole file, I'd love that too.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.336
No, I have time to go through four or five.

53:53.356 --> 53:54.297
Well, I've come back early on.

53:54.766 --> 53:59.272
I mean, not that I want to.

53:59.532 --> 54:02.797
You have to understand, those files are very different.

54:02.817 --> 54:06.401
I mean, Manson was never involved in the day-to-day working for the HRC.

54:07.423 --> 54:08.103
He just wasn't.

54:08.123 --> 54:11.648
I mean, he was running a university as well as he was.

54:11.668 --> 54:19.218
I mean, through the whole time he was here, he was either chancellor or vice president or president or graduate dean or vice president for academic affairs.

54:20.019 --> 54:20.740
He was all of those.

54:22.340 --> 54:25.083
So, you know, he wasn't involved in the daily affairs.

54:25.364 --> 54:29.729
You make it very clear in here that it wasn't just L.D.F.

54:29.749 --> 54:31.010
either by the way.

54:31.030 --> 54:31.431
It wasn't.

54:31.451 --> 54:36.177
But there were a number of other, I think, you know, five... Bought by L.D.F.

54:36.197 --> 54:37.218
and sold the L.D.F.

54:37.278 --> 54:42.244
and bought the taxi in the trade, but that's not true.

54:42.264 --> 54:46.829
There were other people in the car.

54:46.849 --> 54:48.431
And you named some of them in here.

54:48.451 --> 54:48.752
Sure.

54:48.952 --> 54:51.655
Those letters wrote us.

54:52.546 --> 54:54.988
The brother was involved later.

54:56.290 --> 55:03.817
But Dr. Ransom clearly got a little... Oh, Schwartz would say, you've been attacked by vultures, you're naive.

55:03.857 --> 55:04.478
What was he doing?

55:04.578 --> 55:06.139
It was his style.

55:06.620 --> 55:08.261
Every letter, he said, but I saved you.

55:08.662 --> 55:12.486
And God, I got that Yates for you for nothing, and then you stole it from me.

55:13.326 --> 55:21.034
And, you know, which is to say, God, I've gotten all these bargains for you and haven't gotten much credit or...

55:21.892 --> 55:24.374
Oh, Schwartz, you know the stories about Schwartz.

55:24.394 --> 55:25.075
Is it Elliot?

55:26.517 --> 55:37.347
He went over to Elliot at Faber and said he was a representative of such and such a prep school and this prep school is the one thing in his life that he loved dearly before he went to war.

55:37.367 --> 55:47.157
He hands Elliot a pen in his books and says the prep school is coming apart and I really want to give these to the prep school so they can sell them what you sign them.

55:48.453 --> 55:53.941
So he takes him over to Colonel Cohen in the Strand Hotel, over there at the Savoy Hotel in the Strand.

55:54.322 --> 55:56.125
He says, look, I've got some things for you.

55:56.245 --> 55:58.528
Here are 10 Eliot videos.

55:58.809 --> 56:01.413
Cohen says, you can't get Eliot presentation copies and figures.

56:01.433 --> 56:02.134
How'd you get these?

56:02.655 --> 56:05.199
And then he goes, who proceeds to tell the story?

56:06.861 --> 56:07.983
Oh, Schwartz was so nice.

56:08.043 --> 56:09.706
Isn't that wonderful?

56:09.726 --> 56:15.034
Schwartz has been known to actually crawl on Rhoda's floor in Barris, and he had no shame.

56:15.835 --> 56:16.536
He's a character.

56:17.579 --> 56:19.983
He's a dentist, you know.

56:20.043 --> 56:21.004
He's a dentist.

56:21.185 --> 56:21.625
Dr. Swartz.

56:21.926 --> 56:24.510
Now, was he kind of an amateur dealer?

56:24.530 --> 56:26.393
Oh, he was a professional.

56:26.433 --> 56:26.813
He was a dealer.

56:27.274 --> 56:29.798
But he basically made the deal for the handling stuff.

56:29.838 --> 56:32.902
Yeah, right, because he sold the handling stuff.

56:32.923 --> 56:33.764
And he had other stuff.

56:35.106 --> 56:37.369
I mean, he was all over.

56:37.389 --> 56:45.281
There was probably a piece in the New York Times I've ever tracked up there about the doctor and the dentist shaking.

56:45.301 --> 56:46.303
Well, Carlton wrote it.

56:46.942 --> 56:47.963
In the Times, yeah.

56:47.983 --> 56:49.785
In the Times, yeah.

56:51.668 --> 56:56.173
We were running into all these people that I hear about these wonderful people.

56:56.193 --> 56:58.015
Yeah, it's good.

56:58.035 --> 57:05.243
I don't know what else to... I hope I'm welcome to find you with any additional questions.

57:05.263 --> 57:05.624
Sure.

57:05.644 --> 57:10.390
And should I write you about some of these corresponding things, or Ray?

57:11.210 --> 57:12.112
Ray reminds me.

57:12.132 --> 57:14.775
If you tell Ray, I'll get to it.

57:14.795 --> 57:16.797
I'll go in there and pick out some business for you.

57:17.890 --> 57:23.717
Something that could just be a good way to... Sure.

57:23.737 --> 57:25.899
It was a pioneer of time, I guess.

57:26.500 --> 57:26.680
Oh.

57:26.700 --> 57:27.000
Great time.

57:28.062 --> 57:37.332
This could be a very, very good-spirited book that I'm writing, and we are genuinely impressed by what you've had here.

57:37.352 --> 57:38.774
It's a wonderful place.

57:38.794 --> 57:40.095
It's a wonderful place.

57:40.676 --> 57:43.900
The stone, by the way, you've been told was Texas Limes.

57:44.200 --> 57:44.320
It is.

57:45.194 --> 57:50.461
I wonder where that's mining, because that mine is a quarry somewhere here, yeah.

57:50.481 --> 57:53.184
Well, yeah, you know, you have to understand when it came out, too.

57:53.204 --> 57:58.772
We were building in the early 70s, and that means it was post-60s, and that means there was a sense of protecting.

57:59.032 --> 58:06.562
The problem is it's protecting people from getting in rather than people who are in from getting out.

58:06.582 --> 58:12.990
I mean, with all of its sentinel-like qualities, it isn't really

58:13.730 --> 58:16.553
one of the great inventions of security, either.

58:16.573 --> 58:25.060
I mean, it's all right, but it's not, you know, you get a sense that I worry that it isn't welcoming enough.

58:25.080 --> 58:29.965
I don't find that it's any better for you.

58:29.985 --> 58:35.750
Well, the bank of television, I find it less than welcoming, and I don't like that.

58:35.770 --> 58:39.113
And I'd like to have it more welcoming.

58:39.133 --> 58:41.155
But I don't have anything that is stolen from the state.

58:41.236 --> 58:50.328
No, but it's just that students come in and think, God, I just want to look at a book and go through cards and television cameras.

58:50.348 --> 58:58.279
I mean, it is not a warm and welcoming environment, which I would like.

58:58.299 --> 59:00.822
They're tricky, though, the kinds of changes I'd like.

59:00.842 --> 59:08.292
On the other hand, I do a lot of work at Widener, and I get angry at how easy it is to go in and out of there.

59:08.312 --> 59:10.315
Well, I got some...

59:10.818 --> 59:16.606
I'm more interested with the aesthetic than the other one.

59:16.626 --> 59:19.209
I think it looks institutional.

59:19.429 --> 59:25.057
Of course, it is institutional, but I just think there's a way that people aren't fighting.

59:25.077 --> 59:31.726
I'm just going to take a fast look right ahead.

59:31.746 --> 59:35.070
I understood that Ross Perot's block was on the front.

59:36.400 --> 59:39.163
Is that a misconception?

59:39.183 --> 59:45.330
Well, I'll tell you, you know, Ross Perot, it is one of those things.

59:45.510 --> 59:52.118
He could take a straightforward, simple issue and get it as confusing as you could possibly imagine.

59:53.600 --> 59:54.901
It's not always very clear.

59:55.662 --> 01:00:01.969
Perot advanced the money, because he said Texas ought to have that.

01:00:02.135 --> 01:00:12.786
If you try to get what you can get, the university got $4,000, $4 million, $6 million, I'm not sure where, from other people.

01:00:12.806 --> 01:00:19.393
Foundations in Texas and people in Texas.

01:00:19.413 --> 01:00:23.878
So, whether it was the balance or whether it was the whole thing, I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:00:23.898 --> 01:00:30.825
You pay me back for the Ford Center and I'll give that money to the medical center at

01:00:31.733 --> 01:00:34.217
whether it was Dallas or where, I'm not sure.

01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:47.537
So there were three or four trades going on, and I can't tell you right now whether he traded on the balance of what the university got, whether it was $3 million, $4 million, $5 million, $6 million, I don't know.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:51.463
Whether, in other words, he gave $8 million.
