00:02.782 --> 00:08.551
We're now recording and we're talking to Professor Heather Jackson in Toronto.

00:09.753 --> 00:18.086
And as I indicated in that last email that I sent, why not enter a conversation with that comment of yours?

00:18.126 --> 00:23.895
The problem I continue to struggle with has to do with the historical value of marginalia.

00:24.348 --> 00:39.784
which may seem to reveal a lot, but have distinct limitations and need to be handled with care, and the meaning of history of reading, which for some people can be concerned with only who read what, but for others must have a psychological dimension.

00:39.804 --> 00:43.467
That's a fabulous, I think, way to enter the conversation.

00:43.507 --> 00:52.476
I wonder if you could just kind of pick up on that, and then maybe I could ask you to expand in certain areas, and then we can take it from there, if that's okay.

00:52.757 --> 00:54.118
Sure.

00:54.892 --> 00:57.837
Well, there are two questions there, of course.

00:58.438 --> 01:02.724
One about the historical value of marginalia and the other one about the meaning of history of reading.

01:04.848 --> 01:16.426
Historical value of marginalia because it seems to me that our preconceptions get in the way of the way that we interpret reader's notes made in the past.

01:16.446 --> 01:20.292
So people tend to assume that...

01:20.744 --> 01:29.835
When we talk to our books, we're talking to our books, or we're talking to ourselves, and we're just, in an unmediated way, expressing ourselves.

01:30.857 --> 01:42.972
Whereas, as a lot of the examples in my marginalia book indicate, it's usually more complicated than that.

01:43.660 --> 01:53.994
When I go around and get a chance to talk to people about writing notes in books, it's usually a really wonderful experience because people get very confessional.

01:56.157 --> 02:11.659
They're interested, of course, in other people's notes in books because either they are quoted writing books themselves, although they've generally been told they shouldn't do it, or they really can't stand the sight of marginalia, and either way,

02:11.875 --> 02:28.560
to discover that writing in books has a long tradition and that there are some good reasons for doing it, is a revelation to them and encourages them to tell their own stories.

02:28.580 --> 02:40.718
But what I think happens is that because we assume that when we write in our books, it's private and feels spontaneous to us.

02:41.710 --> 02:46.135
is uninhibited, that it was always like that.

02:46.295 --> 02:49.659
There's almost a paradox there, isn't it?

02:49.759 --> 03:02.833
On the one hand, I can see where it would be kind of like a diary, or a journal, where you are more or less writing for yourself without necessarily having an expectation that someone else will see it.

03:03.113 --> 03:09.760
But when you are writing on the pages of a printed book, especially if the book is going to survive, there must be some

03:10.111 --> 03:16.079
implicit understanding that someone is going to come across this at some point.

03:16.099 --> 03:16.540
Do you think?

03:17.061 --> 03:21.547
Yes, I think that certainly people, readers in the past were aware of that.

03:22.007 --> 03:25.372
I think what's happened is that people have forgotten that.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.356
Many people, not all people.

03:28.960 --> 03:42.379
But many people really approach their books as consumers and look on them as disposable, pretty much disposable things which they can use as they choose, and then they don't think further than that.

03:43.361 --> 03:51.913
Although it's certainly true that books do survive and that it's more likely than not that somebody else will survive.

03:52.501 --> 03:55.486
find their notes one day.

03:55.986 --> 03:56.868
I did interrupt.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.512
No, that's okay.

03:59.532 --> 04:10.789
I wanted you to address yourself also to the concept of the history of reading, which you say for some people can be concerned that only who read what, but for others must have a psychological dimension.

04:10.809 --> 04:17.078
I think you were kind of addressing that in a way as well, but just so we don't forget that before we move on.

04:17.098 --> 04:17.238
No.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.622
It's only with the first question, only that

04:19.889 --> 04:38.393
I think that our preconceptions about the privacy, the solitariness and the privacy of the reading experience and therefore the uninhibited nature of marginalia is a false conception because it hasn't always been like that.

04:38.413 --> 04:46.183
And so when we get notes from the past, we really want to consider under what conditions they were written, not only

04:46.400 --> 04:52.748
the personal conditions of the reader, but also the social conditions of the time.

04:52.768 --> 05:01.758
You know, the taken-for-granted conventions, assumptions, even attitudes of the time.

05:01.778 --> 05:04.882
There was a statement that you made earlier, when we talk to our books.

05:04.922 --> 05:06.224
I love that, by the way.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.406
And is it a dialogue, in your view?

05:08.747 --> 05:09.468
No.

05:10.929 --> 05:13.913
We talk to them, but they don't necessarily talk back, right?

05:13.933 --> 05:14.854
Yeah, that's right.

05:14.874 --> 05:15.715
So it's not a dialogue.

05:15.948 --> 05:23.761
Although someone like Petrarch, who wrote these letters to these dead authors, may have taken it to the next level, I guess.

05:23.941 --> 05:25.764
Yes, and Erasmus talked about it.

05:25.784 --> 05:32.736
There's a long literature of people thinking about and talking about their books as friends, companions.

05:32.756 --> 05:36.762
And obviously they're ideal companions because they don't talk back.

05:37.363 --> 05:41.550
But sometimes readers, in the past anyway...

05:41.902 --> 05:43.345
I think they still do it.

05:43.385 --> 05:53.064
In fact, imagine that they're hearing the voice of the author in the words of the book and do talk to it.

05:53.545 --> 05:57.392
It always seems to me a little bit like heckling, though.

05:57.512 --> 06:01.480
You find now, and not to get off track, but...

06:01.915 --> 06:09.431
I know where it took me years to establish a website at the behest of my publisher.

06:09.451 --> 06:10.754
I thought, fine, I'll do it.

06:10.774 --> 06:21.477
But, you know, now where you give them an address where they can contact you, it's amazing the people who... I love to hear from some of them because I have interesting questions, but others are just...

06:21.878 --> 06:26.062
just trying to make contact and ask some of the most inane questions.

06:26.543 --> 06:35.732
But you almost have this new dimension here where the reader can now engage the writer beyond the hardcovers of the book.

06:35.752 --> 06:37.054
Do you answer?

06:37.074 --> 06:39.817
I answer them all, yeah.

06:39.837 --> 06:40.257
I do.

06:40.357 --> 06:40.618
Why not?

06:41.819 --> 06:48.806
I invited it by putting up the website and saying, Nick, you're gently mad.

06:48.906 --> 06:51.649
And I actually got a wonderful note from a woman

06:52.827 --> 07:03.036
Two days ago, I'm now writing a column for this startup magazine called Fine Books and Collections, and I had a quote in there by Larry Lawrence Clark Powell.

07:03.116 --> 07:07.620
He's always driven by the trinity of bookseller, librarian, and collector.

07:08.401 --> 07:09.762
He said, gee, where did you get this quote?

07:09.782 --> 07:11.824
I know you used it in Patience and Fortitude.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.826
You cite it, but it's not in the bibliography.

07:14.227 --> 07:16.308
This is three years after the book came out.

07:16.449 --> 07:20.252
It had already been collected in paperback, and I said, oh, I've got it in there.

07:20.603 --> 07:27.913
She's right, you know.

07:27.973 --> 07:42.032
Well, you know, they're reading you, and they're reading your footnotes, and I wrote her back and thanked her, and I said, oops, but I wish you'd told me this two years ago when I could have gotten it into the first paperback edition, but we'll get it in the next one.

07:42.052 --> 07:43.033
Right.

07:43.013 --> 07:58.010
Anyway, I'm sorry to go off track on that, but you mentioned this long tradition of great readers, and I guess Erasmus certainly would be one of the greatest of all time, who talk about... How did you put it?

07:58.030 --> 08:00.934
He describes his... It's in one of his letters.

08:00.954 --> 08:02.015
It's a wonderful passage.

08:03.196 --> 08:06.540
He is writing to a friend about...

08:06.959 --> 08:13.225
His best friends are the ones whom he can talk to without fear of being criticized and so on and so forth.

08:13.325 --> 08:19.852
And then it's a little joke because he says he will by now have realized that what I'm talking about is my books.

08:20.993 --> 08:21.153
Yeah.

08:21.173 --> 08:32.204
Kind of like the Machiavelli quote, too, where he repairs to his only friends are the books when he puts on his best clothes and he goes in and he... Where's that?

08:32.224 --> 08:33.405
Um...

08:34.128 --> 08:35.892
It's one of his letters, in fact.

08:35.912 --> 08:36.654
It's a famous letter.

08:36.674 --> 08:40.524
In fact, I have it in... I'll email it to you if you'd like.

08:40.584 --> 08:41.887
It's a wonderful quote.

08:41.907 --> 08:44.273
Tony Grafton has used it in one of his...

08:44.590 --> 08:48.636
one of his essays, but it's a wonderful quote.

08:48.656 --> 08:51.480
I think I use it in Patience and Fortitude, I'm not sure.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.986
Anyway, it's a great, great, great quote.

08:56.006 --> 09:00.813
I guess this started, obviously, this started for you with the work on Coleridge.

09:01.654 --> 09:04.598
And had you been interested prior to that?

09:06.241 --> 09:06.501
No.

09:08.103 --> 09:14.412
It was really, Coleridge and Marginalia are really extraordinary, but

09:14.864 --> 09:20.649
It was getting down close to them and then beginning to wonder about why I was doing this.

09:20.669 --> 09:33.140
You know, why was a modern scholarly edition spending six volumes, 6,000 pages, god knows how much money, on notes in the margins of books?

09:33.541 --> 09:39.286
Of course, I faced incredulity of anybody, particularly in the real world, after what I was doing.

09:39.386 --> 09:44.230
I was editing somebody's notes in the margins of books.

09:44.480 --> 10:00.040
just asking myself why I was doing this and how his notes in books had come to be so, well, it was just conceived as part of his work, you know, part of his canonical work, to deserve that kind of attention.

10:00.080 --> 10:04.746
And that got me started thinking about that whole process.

10:04.766 --> 10:06.168
But it does also go back.

10:06.408 --> 10:13.778
I mean, there were, before Coleridge's time, some marginalia were published.

10:14.213 --> 10:17.096
Not usually under a name, exactly.

10:17.656 --> 10:21.419
And there were the collections.

10:21.439 --> 10:24.582
These, I think, are really fascinating things that nobody has done anything with.

10:25.163 --> 10:26.724
The things called ANAs.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.446
How do you spell it?

10:28.466 --> 10:28.786
A-N-A.

10:30.267 --> 10:39.335
So it's Leibniziana and Erasmiana and Plonsoniana and so on.

10:39.796 --> 10:43.579
The casual remarks of learned men.

10:44.116 --> 10:46.520
But it also got extended.

10:46.580 --> 10:54.033
I think it was a French genre, which in the late 18th century became very popular in England.

10:54.934 --> 10:59.542
Mrs. Piazzi's library is full of them, with scores of them.

10:59.562 --> 11:09.499
So I think that there was some interest in the off-the-cuff, off-the-record remarks.

11:09.715 --> 11:11.982
Martin's a book for one of the places where you have those.

11:12.404 --> 11:20.991
But I think Coleridge really is, as you suggest, in a class by himself where his marginality, and not only does he coin the word...

11:21.460 --> 11:25.326
But it's regarded as part of his canon.

11:25.346 --> 11:28.790
I mean, I wonder how many others you could say that about.

11:29.091 --> 11:29.872
Well, there are some.

11:30.673 --> 11:32.956
And it's partly because of him.

11:33.958 --> 11:40.427
But in his lifetime, some of Byron's notes and books were picked up, for instance.

11:40.928 --> 11:42.109
People published thrifts.

11:43.451 --> 11:49.560
And I thought for a long time that Kildred's marginalia were really in a class by themselves, but...

11:49.743 --> 12:02.567
Now that I've done a lot more reading of this kind of material, I think that he's doing something very ordinary in a rather spectacular way.

12:02.587 --> 12:04.190
I love that, yeah.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.835
But things really got me going.

12:07.957 --> 12:09.861
This is a...

12:10.263 --> 12:23.684
The story that I told in an article, which was the first article that I wrote about marginalia, the phenomenon, really was a note that I found, a student's note that I found in a book in the library stacks here.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.247
It was a rude note.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.130
And you had that in the book, I think, right?

12:27.150 --> 12:27.791
Did I?

12:27.811 --> 12:30.535
I'm not sure, because if not, I'd like to get the essay.

12:30.555 --> 12:31.336
I don't think so.

12:31.617 --> 12:32.558
Okay.

12:33.635 --> 12:36.439
No, I don't think I used it in the book.

12:36.459 --> 12:36.899
Okay.

12:37.020 --> 12:41.806
The article is probably listed in the bibliography for the book, but I'll tell you the story very briefly.

12:41.826 --> 12:48.435
It was a student note in an article by Jeffrey Hartman about, with this poem, Yew Trees.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.778
Y-E-W, Yew Trees.

12:51.078 --> 13:03.355
And Hartman goes on and on about you and the sound you in the poem and the way that every time the sound you, as in universal, for instance, comes up, we hear this

13:04.094 --> 13:11.167
It echoes the subject from the title of the poem, The Youth Seed.

13:11.187 --> 13:21.726
And the student obviously got tired of this meticulous analysis of sound patterns in the poem and wrote sarcastic notes in the margin like, long-lived, a professor of English.

13:22.287 --> 13:24.651
And eventually Hartman says about it.

13:24.631 --> 13:34.405
In the word united, at the end of the poem, we hear again this echo of the beauties, and the student wrote in the margins, fuck you, Y-E-W.

13:34.553 --> 13:36.938
And I thought I was so clever.

13:37.018 --> 13:42.089
So, you know, I've got to use... Well, you use it in the essay, right?

13:42.109 --> 13:42.830
I use it.

13:42.850 --> 13:45.355
I'm such a prude, you know, as much as I love this story.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.965
I get to use that word in any of my books.

13:50.065 --> 13:55.296
And I suppose, here I am in the 21st century, you know, an old naval officer, you know, I should...

13:55.276 --> 13:59.603
totally fixed skin to these things, but that's wonderful, isn't it?

14:00.044 --> 14:02.868
And so was this one of these epiphanous moments for you?

14:02.928 --> 14:03.409
It was.

14:03.489 --> 14:04.470
It was.

14:04.511 --> 14:15.848
I thought, oh, this is really neat, and it's really funny, and I've got to use it, and so that means I can't just write a psychology's marginalia.

14:15.868 --> 14:17.952
I have to write about other people's marginalia as well.

14:17.972 --> 14:18.653
Oh, that's wonderful.

14:18.813 --> 14:21.317
And who are students can have thought

14:21.635 --> 14:22.977
would ever read that.

14:23.377 --> 14:25.921
What drove the student to do it?

14:25.941 --> 14:29.807
And what's also kind of cool, too, is that you don't know who the student is.

14:30.247 --> 14:30.848
It's a voice.

14:30.868 --> 14:31.950
Right?

14:32.290 --> 14:32.651
Yeah.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.211
Am I correct?

14:33.592 --> 14:44.047
And then that almost kind of brings in a parallel way your discussion of this contemporary reader of Johnson, Scriblerius, I think.

14:44.107 --> 14:44.888
Yes, Scribler.

14:44.908 --> 14:45.689
Yes, Full Grevel.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.852
Did you ever figure out who that person is?

14:47.872 --> 14:48.553
Yes, Full Grevel.

14:48.820 --> 14:49.541
Is that in the book?

14:49.581 --> 14:50.402
Did I miss that?

14:50.643 --> 14:51.604
Yes, it's there.

14:51.624 --> 14:51.965
Okay, great.

14:51.985 --> 14:53.788
How did you figure that out?

14:54.168 --> 14:56.892
It was probably quite a lot of detective work.

14:57.193 --> 15:04.544
It was probably that he gave himself away in the notes, so if you read them carefully, there's a certain amount of internal evidence, and you just follow that up.

15:05.926 --> 15:07.048
There's no doubt about it.

15:07.028 --> 15:09.792
That's wonderful, isn't it?

15:11.334 --> 15:13.717
That is communing with a reader, another reader.

15:14.197 --> 15:16.280
It's almost a secondary.

15:16.340 --> 15:28.075
The text is the text, but here's someone annotating the book, so to speak, and giving evidence as to who the individual is, and then

15:28.358 --> 15:33.965
A reader 200 years later is able to go and crack the code a little bit.

15:34.006 --> 15:38.291
But the reason you brought it up, I think, is that Scribler has presented himself pseudonymously.

15:38.311 --> 15:38.912
That's right.

15:39.032 --> 15:41.996
He concealed his identity, or he tried to conceal his identity.

15:42.717 --> 15:53.151
And that nowadays, I think that's the thing, that we think that if our books, if it occurs to us at all, we think that our books are just going to go anonymously.

15:53.401 --> 15:55.944
like the student's note in the library stacks.

15:55.964 --> 15:59.348
Nobody's going to know who wrote it.

15:59.668 --> 16:13.925
And that wasn't the case when people wrote in their own books and their books were being lent out and their notes were being copied and their ears were going to be, you know, someone was going to be bequeathed these books.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.430
You know, it's interesting, and I normally don't,

16:19.287 --> 16:30.846
I think it's necessary to quote a blurb on a book, but Tony Grafton's, on your book, I think is pertinent in that you basically have kind of, this field belongs to you.

16:31.968 --> 16:33.711
Yes, the marginalia lady.

16:33.771 --> 16:35.934
Well, I'm giving it up.

16:35.954 --> 16:36.635
Are you really?

16:36.675 --> 16:37.977
It's open to other people now.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.039
No kidding.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.263
And the new book is forthcoming, is that correct?

16:41.563 --> 16:41.984
Yes, it is.

16:42.004 --> 16:43.226
It's called Romantic Readers.

16:43.687 --> 16:43.827
Uh-huh.

16:44.212 --> 17:00.145
and could you tell me a little bit about it uh is it is it a companion volume to to this one or does it kind of explore other areas it's a kind of sequel um i called it romantic readers colon the witness of martinelli and then the

17:00.513 --> 17:25.575
the um marketing people made me change it don't they do that they do that yeah so it's the evidence they really want the word reader i know my my editors want reader in there and they want books and i've got it i said well what's wrong with every book it's reader i mean you have you have it right there and that's a famous library quote you know for one of the uh the five cardinal rules of a

17:25.555 --> 17:30.824
library scientist, you know, and all the librarians seem to like it.

17:30.844 --> 17:32.026
Anyway, that's a whole other story.

17:33.027 --> 17:43.865
So you really feel, obviously, we can tell a lot about the reader by the books that, not only by the books that they read, but the comments that they write into the books.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.631
Do you think also that we can know

17:47.746 --> 17:57.340
We can learn great things about writers, or not just writers, but creative people just by knowing the books that they read by their libraries.

17:57.380 --> 18:05.010
I think Henry James, Leonie Dell did a little monograph on how important Henry James' library was to him.

18:05.431 --> 18:16.707
You think of Gibbon's library, and you point out that Gibbon really didn't annotate his books, but then you do have that one extraordinary book where he did, that one history, that Greek history.

18:17.007 --> 18:24.438
But is it enough to know something about the person by knowing they're reading?

18:24.598 --> 18:35.214
Or do you have to have, you think, either a commonplace book or a marginalia to kind of get at the creative process?

18:35.234 --> 18:38.439
Well, I think you're right.

18:38.479 --> 18:42.706
It sounds as though you don't think the library list is good enough, and I don't either.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.829
Nobody who owns books would think that.

18:44.869 --> 18:44.989
Right.

18:45.526 --> 19:01.527
So I think you have to work with what evidence you've got, and the people who write about Emily Dickinson will take the evidence of a dog-eared book in the family collection, telling them something about her because they need to have so little to go on.

19:01.844 --> 19:08.156
Coleridge is a really interesting case because we do have a list to some extent of e-books.

19:08.176 --> 19:12.144
There is a library's tale catalog, although there are some problems about it.

19:14.008 --> 19:20.460
And people have been working on his library's collection for a long time.

19:20.812 --> 19:27.344
The books that were really important to him, the ones that he really assimilated, are not in that collection.

19:27.364 --> 19:40.407
So you can work backwards from the works and from allusions and quotations in the works to infer something not only about what the person read, but about how deep it went with.

19:40.876 --> 19:44.640
You know, when you think of a library list, it can't be enough.

19:44.660 --> 19:51.987
And I think to go to the other extreme, the Library of Congress has, what, 17,000 books from Adolf Hitler's library?

19:52.888 --> 19:53.549
Right.

19:53.889 --> 19:55.030
You know?

19:55.050 --> 19:55.450
Did he read them?

19:55.470 --> 19:56.311
Did he read any of them?

19:56.411 --> 19:59.775
And I guess a few of them have a few markings on them.

19:59.835 --> 20:03.058
So many of them were given to him, too, I mean, by sycophants or whatever.

20:03.118 --> 20:03.879
Right.

20:03.979 --> 20:07.322
So what does that tell you, I guess, Breonna?

20:07.342 --> 20:07.803
I wonder.

20:07.823 --> 20:08.183
Right.

20:08.163 --> 20:11.887
I guess that's for a whole next generation of scholars to figure out.

20:12.468 --> 20:18.656
It is a developing discipline, though, the history of reading, I can think.

20:18.676 --> 20:19.517
It looks like it.

20:19.537 --> 20:21.339
I don't know quite how it's going to turn out.

20:22.981 --> 20:33.073
The connection between my last book and the next one is that I thought, the first one was in honor study, and I thought what I was doing was opening up the

20:33.408 --> 20:57.964
We're contributing, because other people, particularly Grafton and some other Renaissance scholars, but contributing to the opening up of an order of document which people ought to be glad to get hold of, you know, that they ought to see the potential value of this for historical studies of all sorts.

20:58.349 --> 21:01.636
And the book was very nicely received.

21:01.696 --> 21:05.103
People seemed to enjoy it and it was well-reviewed and so on.

21:05.804 --> 21:13.701
But there was a complete silence on the part of the historians, who were the people I thought would be particularly interested.

21:13.741 --> 21:15.885
So I thought even historians of reading.

21:16.405 --> 21:21.817
Do I believe the people, do you think, that group?

21:22.759 --> 21:33.283
They're more interested in dissemination and in distribution and in influence.

21:33.263 --> 21:40.734
It's funny you should say that, because I'm trying to write into this book, The French Revolution, and I love Dines.

21:40.975 --> 21:48.706
I don't mean to denigrate it in any way, but the Revolution in print book, which is the press in French, it's going to be loaded with stuff, and it's not.

21:48.847 --> 21:50.249
It's not the thing I'm reading at all.

21:51.431 --> 22:00.925
It's the stuff that was there and how we track it and follow it, but I mean, this whole question of how did the book influence the French Revolution, I haven't

22:01.208 --> 22:02.971
I still haven't gotten to that yet.

22:03.171 --> 22:04.433
I still haven't found anything.

22:04.473 --> 22:08.700
I'm sure there must be things out there that are going to tell me that, but I can't find them just yet.

22:09.261 --> 22:15.812
And I don't find that in the Histoire du livre studies at all.

22:16.373 --> 22:27.672
I think that in particular is something that was always said at the time, that Rousseau particularly, and the Encyclopédie...

22:28.040 --> 22:37.652
caused the French Revolution to happen, and that what historians are finding now is that that was certainly an overstatement, and therefore there's a kind of embarrassment about it.

22:38.994 --> 22:42.058
Also, you know, it is hard to influence.

22:42.539 --> 22:44.561
Influence is very hard to trace.

22:44.601 --> 22:47.765
William Sinclair's new book tries to do it.

22:48.226 --> 22:48.947
Which book is that?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.752
It's called The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period.

22:52.932 --> 22:53.152
Oh, okay.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.697
It's a very important, terrific book.

22:56.828 --> 22:58.991
Who publishes it?

22:59.031 --> 23:00.092
Cambridge.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.775
It's a big book.

23:02.795 --> 23:05.158
It's stuffed with useful information.

23:05.459 --> 23:06.159
It's provocative.

23:06.179 --> 23:07.902
It's going to make everybody who reads it mad.

23:08.222 --> 23:09.103
It's just out?

23:09.824 --> 23:10.024
Sorry?

23:10.044 --> 23:10.705
It's just out?

23:11.065 --> 23:11.506
July.

23:12.147 --> 23:12.928
July.

23:12.948 --> 23:14.970
Can you just tell me the title once more, please?

23:15.030 --> 23:18.094
It's The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period.

23:19.070 --> 23:20.232
Okay, good.

23:20.813 --> 23:21.495
You'll like it.

23:21.515 --> 23:22.316
Okay, good.

23:22.336 --> 23:23.118
I'll get right on it.

23:23.559 --> 23:25.903
But he doesn't do a lot with individual readers.

23:25.923 --> 23:28.789
He does a bit, but not a lot with individual readers.

23:28.809 --> 23:36.564
But he struggles with the documenting of influence.

23:36.925 --> 23:38.007
Very hard to do.

23:38.324 --> 23:40.006
We haven't really got a good method yet.

23:40.747 --> 23:42.148
So you say you're leaving the field.

23:42.188 --> 24:02.232
Well, I was sort of halfway through the genesis of the second book, which, because the historians didn't seem to be interested, I thought I would give it one more shot and try to write a history, something that was historically narrow.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.175
So I would take marginalia,

24:05.358 --> 24:09.824
for a short period and see what I could do with it from the point of view of history of reading.

24:09.904 --> 24:12.287
So that's what this one is.

24:12.307 --> 24:17.534
It's written in books in Britain between the 1790s and about 1830s.

24:17.614 --> 24:22.481
So we'll see what happens.

24:22.901 --> 24:27.788
You suggest this in the book.

24:28.207 --> 24:33.717
You really don't discover this stuff until someone physically goes into the books to see if it's there.

24:34.398 --> 24:41.911
And while you do regard this as manuscript material, and I think rightfully so is manuscript material, it's been out in the file.

24:41.991 --> 24:44.115
It hasn't been cataloged anywhere.

24:44.155 --> 24:50.586
You have the books, but until someone, a reader, a scholar, goes in to...

24:51.089 --> 24:53.733
to look at these books, you don't discover this stuff.

24:53.954 --> 25:01.226
I mean, stuff can sit around waiting for generations before anyone... That is kind of interesting, isn't it?

25:01.346 --> 25:03.470
And not terribly scientific, either.

25:03.530 --> 25:06.415
It's like awaiting discovery.

25:07.036 --> 25:11.702
And I guess you've looked at thousands of annotated books right now.

25:11.822 --> 25:15.788
Do you have a rough idea of how many you think you've looked at over there?

25:16.248 --> 25:17.811
Well, probably about 3,000.

25:17.851 --> 25:23.498
That is a 2003 book, but there was some overlap.

25:23.518 --> 25:23.718
Wow.

25:24.860 --> 25:27.103
You must have some favorites in your own collection.

25:27.218 --> 25:28.339
Of course, right.

25:28.779 --> 25:37.627
People are usually interested to be in marginally association items, so they want to know who wrote them, and if it's an important person, then they're important.

25:38.128 --> 25:47.476
But I was really interested in ones in which we don't know who wrote them or the person is not of any significance.

25:47.496 --> 25:54.042
And you do mention you have the Osborne collection up there in Toronto, and so you're actually able to see what kids wrote.

25:54.323 --> 25:54.863
Yes.

25:55.366 --> 26:01.961
And I'm thinking now you have the Ruth Baldwin collection down in Florida, which is like 120,000 books.

26:02.823 --> 26:10.842
And what she really, I wrote about her in Gentle Madness, which she loved were books that were used, that had been used.

26:11.162 --> 26:13.628
You know, the whole idea of getting a pristine book.

26:13.962 --> 26:21.876
Well, he was an athlete who wants a book that's, you know, I mean, it just runs against the antiquarian grain, right?

26:21.956 --> 26:27.645
The more pristine the book is, the better people like it, supposedly.

26:28.126 --> 26:34.076
She wanted books that showed use, you know, books that had little sticky fingers for the chocolate or the jam.

26:34.737 --> 26:36.240
Kids wrote something in there.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.143
There are like 120,000 of these books there.

26:39.363 --> 26:52.718
I remember going down there and just picking up random little things, a gift from a teacher, a grandmother who writes a little note, and you really do kind of get a nice little sense of things.

26:53.719 --> 27:00.987
I know when my first book was published in 1995, I bought it at the Cranbrook New England Writers at Home or something like that.

27:01.007 --> 27:04.371
What I liked about it, it was a hundred and something years old.

27:04.655 --> 27:19.373
And I got it from a bookseller down in Austin, but it had been inscribed from one grandfather to his daughter, and the daughter gave it to someone else, and then each went writing a nice little inscription.

27:19.994 --> 27:24.038
And then it hadn't been written in for like 80 or 90 years until I bought it.

27:24.899 --> 27:31.686
And then I bought it and I gave it to my wife on her birthday, which also happened to be the publication date for the first book.

27:32.246 --> 27:34.148
And she said, don't write in that.

27:34.168 --> 27:34.709
You're going to mess.

27:34.729 --> 27:36.891
I said, oh, sweetie, I'm not messing it up at all.

27:37.572 --> 27:38.112
This is nice.

27:38.132 --> 27:45.559
This is a little history to the book that, you know, I think there's a little bit of context and a little bit of message in there.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.123
But I love writing across these books where people have written it.

27:49.728 --> 27:54.974
And as you point out, it has just become, I suppose libraries have had a lot to do with this.

27:54.994 --> 27:58.017
They've had everything to do with it, but you shouldn't be writing in books.

27:58.157 --> 28:00.520
I mean, you take an oath at the Broadleian, right?

28:00.560 --> 28:01.601
Right, yeah.

28:01.621 --> 28:05.605
You'll go to hell if you write.

28:05.625 --> 28:06.786
Yeah.

28:06.806 --> 28:12.993
And I'm sure you've probably had to take that oath if you've read at the Broadleian.

28:13.013 --> 28:13.454
Absolutely.

28:13.494 --> 28:19.380
But you feel that if these are our books and they have no other great associative...

28:19.782 --> 28:23.366
are antiquated value, we should be writing in them.

28:23.487 --> 28:25.229
Absolutely, yes.

28:26.010 --> 28:37.184
And until about, I don't know, 1840 perhaps, I think the norm was rather the other way around.

28:37.724 --> 28:48.878
What we think, I think, you should correct me on the wrong, is that most people have been properly brought up and they don't write in books, not in any books.

28:49.178 --> 28:56.487
but that a few people do write in books, and those sinners are habitual sinners, and they do it everywhere.

28:56.547 --> 28:57.649
There's no stopping them.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.090
They can't help themselves pray.

28:59.611 --> 29:01.193
Other people's books.

29:01.233 --> 29:04.397
Yes, other people's library books.

29:04.798 --> 29:09.444
But in the past, up until about 1830, I think the norm was exactly the opposite.

29:10.044 --> 29:14.490
That is that most people wrote in their books, but nobody did it habitually.

29:15.431 --> 29:18.595
So that you did it for a good reason.

29:20.144 --> 29:22.788
So that's good from our standpoint then, isn't it?

29:22.808 --> 29:27.456
Because if it was for a good reason, we might usually find something.

29:28.057 --> 29:32.924
Can you think of any of the great epiphanies that you've had, things that you've run across?

29:32.944 --> 29:35.428
I guess we mentioned the student was the first one.

29:35.448 --> 29:37.191
They kind of got you going.

29:37.576 --> 29:42.360
Any other things that you went across and you said, wow, this is fabulous.

29:42.380 --> 29:46.124
It's really, you know, the light goes off over your head.

29:46.144 --> 29:48.406
You see something or some sort of a link is made.

29:48.966 --> 29:53.630
Can you just think of anything offhand that has really decided you like that?

29:53.651 --> 29:58.835
I would have thought, and you must know this experience as well, that it actually happens fairly often.

29:59.556 --> 30:06.402
When you're dealing with material that other people haven't handled, it's sometimes an illusion.

30:06.753 --> 30:13.158
that if you're dealing with material that other people haven't handled, then suddenly a light goes on.

30:13.298 --> 30:16.361
For instance, Mrs. Piazzi.

30:16.461 --> 30:20.765
I really take to her as a writer in the margins of books.

30:21.505 --> 30:30.373
So whenever I get one of her books, it adds something to my sort of growing profile of Mrs. Piazzi.

30:30.833 --> 30:34.536
I think she was a really fascinating person.

30:35.237 --> 30:36.658
But then...

30:36.942 --> 30:42.030
Then there was a time when I was getting some little books.

30:42.050 --> 30:52.727
You know, Robin Alston did a catalog of books with manuscripts in the British Library, and he was just taking things out of the electronic record that were recorded as having manuscript elements.

30:52.747 --> 30:58.557
So I was following those to find as many as I could annotated in the romantic period.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.022
And I began, quite often what happens is that

31:02.913 --> 31:14.370
Although no name is attached, there is in fact a name in the book, because people who are going to write in books usually put their name in first, and then they write in books, and you can match the hands.

31:14.971 --> 31:23.503
So quite often, even though the catalogers haven't identified the annotator, the ownership inscription don't identify the annotator, and I realized

31:23.990 --> 31:42.272
that I was getting quite a lot of books, little, crummy little books, but really crammed with notes by an intelligent and interesting reader whose name was Philip McTermott, and he was a physician in Dublin.

31:42.432 --> 31:49.761
And so I asked the archivist at the library whether they had any provenance records for these books.

31:50.112 --> 31:52.135
And I had a little group of them.

31:52.155 --> 31:52.576
And they did.

31:53.116 --> 32:07.918
They produced the original list from about 1866 in which they were offered about, I don't know, 500 titles and bought about 200 for 11 pounds because they were reading crummy little books.

32:08.639 --> 32:10.522
And so I began calling them up.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.767
They were there in the collection, the ones that they had bought.

32:13.787 --> 32:16.491
And sure enough, they had MacDermott's notes in them.

32:16.657 --> 32:18.600
M-C-D-E-R-M-O-T-T?

32:19.260 --> 32:19.941
M-A-C.

32:20.142 --> 32:20.642
M-A-C.

32:21.443 --> 32:22.645
D-E-R-M-O-T-T.

32:23.286 --> 32:25.268
Not necessarily the Irish Mac.

32:25.288 --> 32:26.790
It's M-A-C, right?

32:26.810 --> 32:28.132
He is M-A-C.

32:28.152 --> 32:28.713
Yeah, okay, good.

32:28.733 --> 32:29.153
Interesting.

32:29.674 --> 32:33.879
He must have studied in London and then in Edinburgh and then gone back to Dublin.

32:34.740 --> 32:45.955
Or the time that I began in the British Library, they had a bunch of volumes, I think 11 of them, of

32:46.306 --> 32:52.913
a collection of Regency satirical poems, little poems about 30 pages long.

32:52.933 --> 32:57.338
And they all have notes in them.

32:57.358 --> 33:12.415
And I realized gradually that these notes were all in the same hand and that someone was, someone in the period realizing that these were topical and that the

33:12.833 --> 33:19.607
the reasons for the, or the meaning of the poems was going to be lost, wrote in little explanations.

33:20.990 --> 33:24.216
And then one day I was able to find out who he had been.

33:24.236 --> 33:27.463
So, you know, there are those kinds of lights that come on.

33:27.623 --> 33:30.108
Or, one last example, William Beckford.

33:30.750 --> 33:33.014
You must know Beckford.

33:33.034 --> 33:34.437
Yes, he's the...

33:34.568 --> 33:44.483
Somebody, I guess, said he lived a worthless life or a useless life, but he was really quite a collector, and as you point out, also quite a writer of marginality, I guess.

33:44.723 --> 33:45.645
That's fantastic.

33:45.665 --> 33:47.527
But he did it in a very unusual way.

33:48.208 --> 34:03.411
I mean, usually, when I look at Tillridge or Keats or Blake in the context of what their contemporaries were doing with their books, I can see that they're doing the same thing that many other people were doing.

34:03.745 --> 34:05.107
Right.

34:05.287 --> 34:11.875
And that's another kind of revelation to realize what it is that Blake was doing when he wrote in his books.

34:12.075 --> 34:13.076
He wasn't just venting.

34:14.338 --> 34:16.560
Or king.

34:17.061 --> 34:20.105
But Beckford, I don't know anybody else who did what Beckford does.

34:22.448 --> 34:24.290
And Blake was, you said he wasn't venting.

34:24.310 --> 34:25.151
What was Blake?

34:25.171 --> 34:26.352
Someone like Blake doing?

34:26.392 --> 34:28.415
Blake's one of my great heroes, I have to say.

34:28.675 --> 34:29.877
Yes, mine too.

34:29.937 --> 34:30.317
Wonderful.

34:30.718 --> 34:31.879
Wonderful.

34:32.197 --> 34:39.653
The guy teaches himself languages so he can illustrate the original.

34:39.674 --> 34:40.996
How many people do that?

34:41.016 --> 34:42.480
Yes, a real obsession.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.542
Yes, just really wonderful.

34:43.662 --> 34:44.584
Wonderful man.

34:45.486 --> 34:52.602
You use the phrase, you call people like Erasmus and Montaigne and John Dee and I guess Voltaire would...

34:52.852 --> 34:55.175
apply assured readers.

34:55.235 --> 35:02.484
Do you have a hierarchical system for categorizing readers?

35:02.764 --> 35:06.169
I think you call assured.

35:06.189 --> 35:07.550
I'd like to phrase it.

35:07.570 --> 35:08.572
Possibly.

35:08.652 --> 35:09.633
I agree with that.

35:09.833 --> 35:11.175
What is an assured reader?

35:11.215 --> 35:11.615
I wonder.

35:12.597 --> 35:14.539
ASSURED assured.

35:15.110 --> 35:19.636
I mean, you must know them when you see them, I guess, as they say.

35:19.656 --> 35:23.121
What's the difference between pornography and erotica, you know, when you see it?

35:27.106 --> 35:27.547
I guess.

35:27.607 --> 35:30.230
I mean, I'm just being silly here at this point.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.693
Well, Blake would certainly be in a short release.

35:33.655 --> 35:38.661
I think that what he was doing was pursuing an alternative method of publication.

35:40.223 --> 35:40.624
Really?

35:42.607 --> 35:42.747
Mm-hmm.

35:42.767 --> 35:43.648
That's wonderful.

35:44.101 --> 35:47.027
Yeah, that's such a great little insight.

35:47.308 --> 35:53.882
When Catherine the Great buys Voltaire's library, and of course he was one of the... He was, yeah.

35:53.982 --> 35:58.031
I mean, it's not just getting his books, you really are getting a piece of him, aren't you?

35:58.111 --> 35:59.313
Yeah.

35:59.333 --> 36:02.059
And have you had a chance to look at any of his books?

36:02.410 --> 36:03.691
No, I haven't.

36:03.711 --> 36:05.833
I've been doing British readers.

36:05.853 --> 36:09.217
But of course, a lot of Voltaire's marginalia are published.

36:09.818 --> 36:12.380
And the French do it in that rather interesting way.

36:12.400 --> 36:22.891
That is, they bring out an edition of the works, and then they include interesting, or notes by interesting readers among the footnotes.

36:24.132 --> 36:30.038
So that you get Voltaire's comment on leader or whatever it is, as well as

36:30.541 --> 36:33.746
Baudelaire or, you know, somebody else.

36:33.766 --> 36:35.870
You don't know if there are any English editions of this stuff.

36:36.591 --> 36:38.494
Well, as well, they're pretty much in French.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.355
Pretty much in French.

36:39.375 --> 36:42.901
That's not going to help me too much.

36:42.961 --> 36:44.764
You mentioned Emily Dickinson's scholars.

36:44.844 --> 36:47.548
Now, have they been trying to determine her?

36:47.769 --> 36:52.136
Are there some pretty good essays or books that you can suggest about Dickinson's?

36:52.156 --> 36:52.937
That's in the first book.

36:53.086 --> 36:56.449
So you can check it out there.

36:56.469 --> 36:57.410
Which one, I'm sorry, was it?

36:57.490 --> 36:59.152
It's in Marginalia.

36:59.172 --> 36:59.452
Okay.

37:00.833 --> 37:06.779
There's not very much, and it's very tenuous.

37:06.799 --> 37:13.465
But it is of great concern, trying to determine what she read, who she was, this recluse, so to speak.

37:13.685 --> 37:16.408
Where was all this stuff coming from?

37:16.448 --> 37:20.832
We have so much of a correspondence, so we know it couldn't have all been coming from there.

37:21.233 --> 37:26.902
And then you have somebody like Emerson, where they have his borrowing records, like at Harvard or even at Boston S&AM.

37:27.483 --> 37:32.531
So you know books that he actually went to get, but he didn't write in them, so to speak.

37:33.954 --> 37:36.818
Did he keep notebooks?

37:36.959 --> 37:38.501
That would be the next question, right?

37:38.521 --> 37:39.503
He did keep notebooks.

37:40.224 --> 37:43.790
And I guess the notebooks don't work for you.

37:43.850 --> 37:48.117
It has to be in the print book, right?

37:48.137 --> 37:48.237
Yeah.

37:49.178 --> 37:53.586
And, of course, this is a tradition that goes back even earlier than the printed book.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.811
I mean, even in the old manuscript books.

37:55.831 --> 37:56.652
Certainly.

37:56.672 --> 38:02.764
But for you, it's the printed book because this is a whole different calculus going on, isn't it?

38:02.864 --> 38:05.950
Once it's print and it's reaching a wider audience.

38:07.253 --> 38:09.657
It is, for you, print, right?

38:09.978 --> 38:11.541
Well, um...

38:11.926 --> 38:19.438
Yes and no, because the traditions carry over.

38:20.319 --> 38:33.900
So the kinds of people who write at random in the margins of books, or at least not so much, I know maybe children, but grown-up educated readers,

38:34.673 --> 38:36.595
Indeed, they don't need to be formally educated.

38:37.096 --> 38:44.585
Literate people, when they write in the margins of books, usually fall into one category or other.

38:44.625 --> 38:49.872
And there are some kinds of notes, like glosses, you know, the meanings of words that you don't understand.

38:50.292 --> 38:53.556
Those go right back through the manuscripts when they continue to today.

38:54.177 --> 38:57.321
Other kinds die out.

38:57.341 --> 39:02.267
There are a couple in the Romantic period that are really completely mystified.

39:02.585 --> 39:14.979
There are so many living authors who, Harold Bloom, for instance, his library of 25,000 or so books are going to an institution in Vermont.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.443
And when I spoke to Harold, and he actually credited your book.

39:18.543 --> 39:26.051
He said, now, after reading Professor Jackson's book, he said, it's okay to write in my book.

39:26.071 --> 39:29.335
I said, Harold, I wish you'd been doing it for the last 50 years, you know.

39:29.534 --> 39:34.460
Then you have Susan Sontag's library out at UCLA, I guess.

39:34.500 --> 39:42.711
And then there are just multiple examples of, I think, Margaret Atwood's books at Toronto, I think.

39:42.731 --> 39:48.458
So does any of this, especially of living writers or recent contemporary writers, does this interest you at all?

39:48.518 --> 39:52.363
It interests me, but I'm not going to be writing about it.

39:53.144 --> 39:55.988
Northrop Frye's books are here at Toronto.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.870
Those are terrific.

39:58.019 --> 40:05.429
notes in them, and they've kept the annotated books separate so that you can go and pull them off the shelf and see what's there.

40:06.330 --> 40:11.817
Iris Murdoch's books just went, just were sold.

40:11.837 --> 40:14.040
Actually, I don't remember what happened to them.

40:14.060 --> 40:14.741
Did you?

40:14.761 --> 40:19.948
They were sold, yeah, and I'll have to check it out.

40:19.968 --> 40:20.208
I'll know.

40:20.248 --> 40:23.773
Those were said to have, and I would expect them to have very

40:24.327 --> 40:26.751
Qualsome notes in the market.

40:27.412 --> 40:28.053
Critical notes.

40:28.073 --> 40:29.896
I hope it went off as a collection.

40:30.537 --> 40:31.218
I think it did.

40:32.660 --> 40:34.624
I'll check it out.

40:34.644 --> 40:39.832
I've never seen something on it and then I didn't follow up on it.

40:39.852 --> 40:40.253
I don't know.

40:40.273 --> 40:42.857
They didn't go to auction, did they?

40:42.957 --> 40:44.379
Or was it done, you think, privately?

40:44.399 --> 40:46.082
I think they went.

40:47.345 --> 40:52.832
Don't remember, I may be able to, I think I have a file into which I drop these things and I may be able to send you it.

40:52.852 --> 40:55.936
Well, if you have it, I can probably find it.

40:55.956 --> 40:59.781
I'm sure it's a LexisNexis will turn it up or something like that.

40:59.801 --> 41:01.483
What was that, LexisNexis?

41:01.503 --> 41:02.204
No, what is that?

41:02.405 --> 41:04.487
Oh, LexisNexis is unbelievable.

41:05.028 --> 41:07.992
At University, I'm sure I have it.

41:08.012 --> 41:14.280
It's this database of billions of news stories in the last 20 years.

41:15.087 --> 41:23.740
that you can just put in your little, and it's not just news in the newspapers, but journals and magazines.

41:23.760 --> 41:31.813
This is really my, I didn't have this available to me for the first two books, but it's amazing what you can do.

41:32.114 --> 41:33.476
Just searching for stories.

41:33.496 --> 41:37.844
And then obviously you have to go to the next level one and get the backup on it.

41:37.864 --> 41:41.911
But I do a pretty quick search and find out what it is.

41:41.931 --> 41:44.435
Is that L-E-X-U-S?

41:44.455 --> 41:44.696
L-E-X-I-S.

41:44.716 --> 41:45.096
Nexus.

41:45.117 --> 41:45.898
Oh, yes, right.

41:46.018 --> 41:46.579
Of course.

41:46.829 --> 42:08.922
and uh and there's an academic universe, one which every institution has and it's wonderful if you have an academic account because for someone like me, it's three bucks every time I download this story. Oh i go to clark and holy cross here in Worcester, where they uh give me privileges which is just terrific.

42:09.138 --> 42:11.482
I think, let me just take a quick look at the notes.

42:12.985 --> 42:20.217
What I'd like to do is to transcribe this and send you a copy.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.924
I'll let you take a look at it and see if there's anything you'd like to add or whatever.

42:24.765 --> 42:24.906
Okay.

42:25.266 --> 42:29.694
And then if we could follow up if that's okay with you.

42:31.036 --> 42:31.517
Sure.

42:31.987 --> 42:34.191
I think of what I'd like to do.

42:34.211 --> 42:38.518
Are you familiar with the collection of books about Bernie Rosenthal sent to Yale?

42:38.918 --> 42:40.541
Yes.

42:40.561 --> 42:41.082
Yes.

42:41.122 --> 42:42.644
I use that in the original book.

42:42.805 --> 42:48.714
And, of course, they published a wonderful catalog of it with facsimiles.

42:49.095 --> 42:49.556
Exactly.

42:49.916 --> 42:51.319
So you can use it with students.

42:51.339 --> 42:51.779
Exactly.

42:51.820 --> 42:52.601
It's marvelous.

42:53.042 --> 42:54.123
That's a wonderful book.

42:55.045 --> 42:56.527
I think we've covered a lot here.

42:56.868 --> 42:58.230
And...

42:59.071 --> 43:03.158
I think what I'd like to do is just transcribe this.

43:03.578 --> 43:08.066
You mentioned Gladstone's books are kind of a disappointment for you.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.288
Yes.

43:09.368 --> 43:14.076
I haven't actually seen very many of them because I didn't go to Wales.

43:14.096 --> 43:25.855
But I've seen a few and, you know, you can, with someone who is a systematic marker up of books, you can tell a good deal from Marx's teachings.

43:26.138 --> 43:28.582
Marginalia are mostly just marks.

43:28.602 --> 43:32.869
People have done a lot with those, although there are also a few brilliant notes.

43:33.149 --> 43:40.301
And the reason I mention it is because he is a case where you can be a great reader, but not necessarily a great writer.

43:40.321 --> 43:41.142
Or Virginia Woolf.

43:41.162 --> 43:42.865
Or Virginia Woolf, precisely.

43:43.233 --> 43:46.238
You could be a fabulous reader.

43:46.298 --> 43:50.244
I don't know how much Johnson wrote in his book either, for that matter.

43:50.404 --> 43:55.012
There are a number that survived, but I don't think there are that many, right?

43:55.032 --> 43:55.893
No, that's right.

43:56.554 --> 43:59.098
That's what I mean about...

43:59.804 --> 44:03.949
writing infrequently, but on special occasions.

44:03.969 --> 44:08.875
Johnson used to use books, too, as he marked them up for the dictionary, so that's kind of professional use.

44:08.895 --> 44:17.525
Right, and then, of course, they went back to the people who loaned them, and they said they were ruined.

44:17.625 --> 44:22.310
God, but they didn't know, right?

44:22.330 --> 44:24.613
But he also did write...

44:25.015 --> 44:46.278
For Carl Spalman, for instance, he annotated one of her books and gave it back to her so that this is, I think, the most interesting use of marginalia is to see one reader deliberately writing in a book as a guide to another so that the two of them will be able over distance to read it together.

44:47.439 --> 44:48.180
That's wonderful.

44:48.661 --> 44:50.022
Yes, that's great stuff.

44:51.043 --> 44:53.706
So your new book is coming in March?

44:54.040 --> 44:55.442
In the spring, I don't know exactly.

44:55.462 --> 44:56.363
In the spring, good.

44:56.383 --> 45:03.150
Well, I'll make sure I get a copy of it, and it'll be plenty of time to get a look at it.

45:03.170 --> 45:10.859
I'm going to be coming down to Boston in February to give a lecture at the Boston Public Library about, in fact, about Adams of March.

45:10.919 --> 45:12.701
Do you know the date?

45:13.201 --> 45:14.142
February the 16th.

45:14.302 --> 45:14.783
I'll be there.

45:15.183 --> 45:15.804
Oh, great.

45:16.325 --> 45:16.925
I wouldn't miss it.

45:17.986 --> 45:20.069
Thanks, I'll be here the whole month of February.

45:20.349 --> 45:20.709
Terrific.

45:20.769 --> 45:22.191
So that would be fabulous.

45:22.694 --> 45:24.777
Well, I think I'll let you go, Professor.

45:26.300 --> 45:29.064
Thanks so much for agreeing to do this on such short notice.

45:29.986 --> 45:36.236
I'm leaving on a trip Wednesday, having gone for 10 days, but I'll take my tape recorder with me and my computer.

45:36.737 --> 45:44.770
So I should have this transcribed within the next week or so, and I'll send it to you as an attachment on an email, and you can take a look at it.

45:45.442 --> 45:46.343
It'll be long.

45:46.383 --> 45:52.872
It'll be like 15 or 16 or whatever single-space type written pages.

45:52.892 --> 45:57.037
But as you understand, I won't be using the whole thing.

45:57.658 --> 46:07.912
But if there's anything that bothers you or that you want to correct or that you want to add to, I encourage you to do it.

46:08.733 --> 46:08.833
Good.

46:08.982 --> 46:10.365
You will have to call me Heather.
