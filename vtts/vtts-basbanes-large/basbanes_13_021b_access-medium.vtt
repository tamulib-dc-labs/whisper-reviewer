00:03.001 --> 00:14.985
There's always a lion.

00:15.005 --> 00:20.597
I think, I expect it to go.

00:20.617 --> 00:23.322
But I almost went back further than that.

00:23.302 --> 00:44.922
you know thousands of years

00:44.902 --> 01:07.970
This is me, J-A-N-I-S-T.

01:07.990 --> 01:08.391
This is me, Charles.

01:08.411 --> 01:08.871
And I am a good friend.

01:08.891 --> 01:09.492
I'd like to sit here with you.

01:33.923 --> 01:52.557
What a serious, real scholar.

01:52.577 --> 01:54.200
Oh, there's two times, but I am, but I am a little, I don't even have to do that.

01:54.220 --> 01:54.520
Okay, go ahead.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.083
And if you're a scholar, you're a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

02:20.195 --> 02:39.283
It's nice to have you here.

02:41.120 --> 03:03.162
You were not okay.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.283
It was wonderful, and I'm glad you got the opportunity.

03:04.303 --> 03:06.045
I am excited to concentrate on that man, because really deep in my heart, I understand.

03:06.065 --> 03:06.566
This is for Julie, J.U.S.

03:06.586 --> 03:07.026
L.I.E., Lama, L-A-M-A.

03:07.006 --> 03:27.927
And what did you tell me about that?

03:27.947 --> 03:28.788
Julie is also a woman who made a painting.

03:28.808 --> 03:29.589
And she was a very eclectic collection.

03:29.609 --> 03:30.389
And she has a very eclectic collection.

03:30.409 --> 03:31.190
And she has a very eclectic collection.

03:31.210 --> 03:31.991
And she has a very eclectic collection.

03:32.011 --> 03:32.792
And she has a very eclectic collection.

03:32.812 --> 03:33.593
And she has a very eclectic collection.

03:33.613 --> 03:34.393
And she has a very eclectic collection.

03:34.413 --> 03:34.494
Yes.

03:34.514 --> 03:34.954
I think it's only one.

03:34.934 --> 03:46.068
But she is a plastic collector and we've had a good time throughout the years collecting her.

03:46.088 --> 03:47.593
And when we're on trips together, the first place we had was in Pittsburgh.

03:52.552 --> 04:16.956
I'm noticing that you're talking about beautiful mountains and I've heard anyone say that anymore.

04:33.743 --> 05:02.248
Thank you, officer.

05:03.005 --> 05:27.331
And it's a pleasure to meet you, and you're very interesting.

05:27.351 --> 05:28.352
I think you live in a very interesting state, too.

05:28.372 --> 05:29.113
I've spoken to a lot of your stories.

05:29.093 --> 05:38.125
I got lots of posters.

05:38.345 --> 05:55.388
We do give out our posters.

05:55.368 --> 06:00.116
I don't know, I've got a lot of data now, but these parts still work.

06:00.136 --> 06:08.229
But I do understand that I'm walking, walking, walking, walking, walking on the street, and there, you know, going through that.

06:08.269 --> 06:09.691
Oh, yeah.

06:09.751 --> 06:10.472
You're all right.

06:10.492 --> 06:11.574
You're all right.

06:11.634 --> 06:12.375
You're all right.

06:12.395 --> 06:13.076
You're all right.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.659
You're walking, because you're going home.

06:14.639 --> 06:21.271
Yes, who else would want others to be the most?

06:21.591 --> 06:26.019
No, but no one else could do that.

06:26.039 --> 06:28.223
Obviously, the woman who was here was not a person.

06:28.243 --> 06:29.866
You understood that.

06:29.886 --> 06:31.990
Well, at least you have to express away everything.

06:32.881 --> 06:50.753
My mother, yeah, but I would much rather have to do some things at Christmas time, too.

06:50.773 --> 06:51.053
Oh, of course.

06:51.073 --> 06:51.574
That's a very good thing.

06:51.594 --> 06:52.496
Well, I could have all had to stay like that.

06:52.516 --> 06:53.658
I gave a time at the Morgan Library in the United States.

06:53.678 --> 06:54.199
New York's four countries.

06:54.219 --> 06:54.800
And right out of the country.

06:54.820 --> 06:54.940
Maybe.

06:54.920 --> 07:13.097
And we sold out a hundred times and ran out upon the cliff.

07:13.077 --> 07:27.613
But I know these people all from my board members.

07:28.474 --> 07:32.238
They said, would you like a poster?

07:32.258 --> 07:32.418
You bet.

07:32.438 --> 07:33.519
They said, well, we'll ship it.

07:33.539 --> 07:34.760
I said, no, I'll take it.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.481
I'll put out a quota for the story.

07:35.501 --> 07:36.082
I just put away my full card.

07:36.102 --> 07:38.084
And I said, there, I had to do a real assignment with playwrights.

07:38.104 --> 07:38.544
And I went over there.

07:38.564 --> 07:39.085
You know, I had my poster.

07:39.065 --> 08:01.657
And I went up to his speech, and I looked like, excuse me, Mr. Trump, and I had a good speech.

08:01.677 --> 08:02.338
And that would be how to take it.

08:02.358 --> 08:02.639
Oh, of course.

08:02.659 --> 08:03.420
So should I, who should I describe it?

08:03.440 --> 08:03.600
A-R-E-N.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.061
What's your last name?

08:04.081 --> 08:04.521
My last name is M-A-R.

08:04.541 --> 08:04.802
It's A-S-E-O.

08:04.822 --> 08:05.022
M-A-R-E-N.

08:05.643 --> 08:30.327
Your books are here.

08:30.347 --> 08:30.788
I'll pass them, right?

08:30.808 --> 08:30.988
Oh, yeah.

08:31.008 --> 08:31.508
And I'm going to make it.

08:31.528 --> 08:31.949
I'm going to make it.

08:31.969 --> 08:32.389
I'm going to make it.

08:32.409 --> 08:32.830
I'm going to make it.

08:32.850 --> 08:33.270
I'm going to make it.

08:36.777 --> 09:05.434
There is, yeah, it's pretty sweet.

09:09.059 --> 09:30.175
Oh, he's wonderful.

09:30.195 --> 09:30.696
Shall I rest in the room?

09:31.115 --> 09:44.058
What are you saying about Mr. Marcus?

09:44.078 --> 09:44.639
I'm saying Marcus was there.

09:44.659 --> 09:45.060
He was the last one.

09:45.080 --> 09:45.480
He was the last one.

09:45.500 --> 09:45.901
He was the last one.

09:45.921 --> 09:46.322
He was the last one.

09:46.342 --> 09:46.743
He was the last one.

09:46.763 --> 09:47.163
He was the last one.

09:47.183 --> 09:47.584
He was the last one.

09:47.604 --> 09:48.005
He was the last one.

09:48.025 --> 09:48.426
He was the last one.

09:48.446 --> 09:48.846
He was the last one.

09:48.866 --> 09:49.267
He was the last one.

09:49.287 --> 09:49.688
He was the last one.

09:49.708 --> 09:50.109
He was the last one.

09:50.129 --> 09:50.529
He was the last one.

09:50.549 --> 09:50.950
He was the last one.

09:50.970 --> 09:51.371
He was the last one.

09:51.391 --> 09:51.792
He was the last one.

09:51.812 --> 09:52.212
He was the last one.

09:52.232 --> 09:52.633
He was the last one.

09:52.613 --> 10:09.508
If I had that story, that's the kind of story we've lived back here.

10:09.488 --> 10:33.673
L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A L-I-G-I-A

10:34.193 --> 10:57.110
Are you a collector?

10:57.130 --> 10:57.530
I'm not a collector.

10:57.550 --> 10:58.512
I'm a book lover, and I'm able to read the book.

10:58.532 --> 10:58.892
The cover's great.

10:58.912 --> 10:59.594
I think they're very good to size.

10:59.614 --> 10:59.914
Very beautiful.

11:02.358 --> 11:23.488
... ...

11:25.122 --> 11:41.771
And it's always good that you don't follow your message.

11:41.791 --> 11:42.673
I have a cavern that says I have a question.

11:42.693 --> 11:43.073
I have to be there.

11:43.093 --> 11:43.194
Okay.

11:43.214 --> 11:43.975
That's just making yourself organized.

11:44.748 --> 12:01.508
... ... ... ...

12:01.488 --> 12:18.164
I'm glad you came to our feet.

12:18.184 --> 12:18.605
It's a special place.

12:18.625 --> 12:19.286
I'm going to second to try it on.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.509
I just had to come and be just as ready as much as possible.

12:21.333 --> 12:48.747
There's a new book that I'm writing, I would say, with my own feelings and feelings.

12:48.767 --> 12:49.768
I'm also here to write a book with white warriors.

12:49.788 --> 12:49.888
Sure.

12:50.425 --> 13:05.832
Here we go.

13:05.852 --> 13:06.072
Here we go.

13:07.925 --> 13:32.855
I just want to congratulate you that I thought your presentation was really like you.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.557
It was absolutely marvelous, and I especially enjoyed hearing all about Mr. Humbert.

13:34.577 --> 13:35.017
He supports my family.

13:35.037 --> 13:36.099
I tell you, it is a shame they don't want to do that.

13:36.119 --> 13:36.379
It really is.

13:36.528 --> 13:58.262
It was a charming story, and I wouldn't even like to meet the man.

13:58.282 --> 13:58.723
He's not a bad person.

13:58.743 --> 13:59.905
As I say in the book, I quote a guy who's not an evil man.

13:59.925 --> 14:00.967
He's sick, he has an attack, and they live obsessed.

14:00.987 --> 14:01.928
When they're a child, I'll follow on that jury.

14:01.908 --> 14:08.965
It would have been tough.

14:08.985 --> 14:14.940
I mean, I wouldn't let them go out, but I should have said this at a certain time.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.401
I wouldn't say either.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.587
I mean, you know, we have great history, and people that do all the time.

14:17.607 --> 14:17.807
It's okay.

14:17.787 --> 14:23.676
That's what I would have done with him.

14:23.777 --> 14:30.728
He told me, he asked me what was.

14:30.808 --> 14:44.470
He said, you have to think of how I will ever be welcomed in the world of liberal style.

14:44.450 --> 15:07.222
Well, Steve was robbing them like crazy.

15:07.242 --> 15:09.124
And he says, well, he said, I mean, I could give lectures in the world of, you know, security.

15:09.144 --> 15:09.805
That's what I think you guys did.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.486
That's what you should have done.

15:10.506 --> 15:11.027
Well, that was delightful.

15:11.047 --> 15:11.247
Thank you.

15:11.267 --> 15:11.467
Thank you.

15:11.487 --> 15:11.688
Thank you.

15:11.708 --> 15:11.908
Thank you.

15:11.888 --> 15:24.697
Thank you.

15:24.717 --> 15:24.918
Thank you.

15:24.938 --> 15:25.138
Thank you.

15:27.346 --> 15:42.216
.

15:42.236 --> 15:42.256
.

15:42.277 --> 15:42.297
.

15:42.317 --> 15:42.337
.

15:42.357 --> 15:42.377
.

15:42.397 --> 15:42.417
.

15:42.437 --> 15:42.457
.

15:42.477 --> 15:42.497
.

15:42.517 --> 15:42.537
.

15:42.517 --> 16:10.548
No, no, I try to keep in mind what I'm talking about.

16:10.568 --> 16:11.129
Do you want to go to Austin?

16:11.149 --> 16:11.509
I'll go to Austin.

16:11.529 --> 16:11.890
I'll go to Austin.

16:11.910 --> 16:12.270
I'll go to Austin.

16:12.250 --> 16:39.092
Well, I've been there.

16:39.112 --> 16:39.433
I've been there.

16:39.453 --> 16:39.773
I've been there.

16:39.794 --> 16:40.114
I've been there.

16:43.148 --> 16:51.896
Thank you so much.

16:51.916 --> 16:52.197
You know what?

16:52.598 --> 16:56.483
I think this would have really grieved me if I'd watched it.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.207
I have another one that we could have left.

17:00.448 --> 17:02.470
This is funny.

17:02.550 --> 17:08.317
Remember Toby Holtzman, the collector of the guy that had a chapter of Toby Holtzman?

17:08.378 --> 17:12.142
When I hear him talk, I hear him listen.

17:12.342 --> 17:13.404
I must be more interested in you.

17:13.424 --> 17:15.106
Toby came and he was a classic.

17:15.126 --> 17:16.868
One of the things he put in, like a book pack.

17:16.848 --> 17:21.559
Now, do you have any more checks that are hidden in your clubies anywhere?

17:21.639 --> 17:26.530
The checks are not about to lose.

17:27.472 --> 17:28.174
Okay, sweetie.

17:28.458 --> 17:51.261
Oh, here, just before you leave, I mentioned our good friend Marty Montgomery's name, and you said that Marty and Joyce are somewhat of a reputation.

17:51.281 --> 17:55.886
Well, I first met him because I read his first book in Trapfishing and wrote a short note, the first one I've ever written.

17:55.906 --> 17:57.688
Well, I'm looking to be right, so I was very lucky to have a look.

17:57.668 --> 18:23.096
Well, unlike a lot of the angling riders who can't manage to strain a couple of the new dances together, the late American farm rider said that you can't speak to the right about fishing.

18:23.116 --> 18:24.137
Fish are the right.

18:24.157 --> 18:27.220
Riders that fish, read the latter.

18:27.605 --> 18:48.313
I'll cut it out.

18:49.390 --> 19:00.951
Thank you.

19:00.971 --> 19:01.172
Thank you.

19:01.642 --> 19:20.671
But I wanted to ask you, the question that came up is, what did you mean?

19:20.691 --> 19:21.432
Did you use himself as a whole world?

19:21.452 --> 19:22.013
Did he actually use himself?

19:21.993 --> 19:37.260
And so he talks about the rest of the world.

19:37.280 --> 19:37.741
He's doing a new radio.

19:37.761 --> 19:38.222
He's doing a new radio.

19:38.242 --> 19:38.703
He's doing a new radio.

19:38.723 --> 19:39.184
He's doing a new radio.

19:39.204 --> 19:39.665
He's doing a new radio.

19:39.685 --> 19:40.145
He's doing a new radio.

19:40.165 --> 19:40.626
He's doing a new radio.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.107
He's doing a new radio.

19:41.127 --> 19:41.588
He's doing a new radio.

19:42.817 --> 20:08.392
But he believed that, you know, he was Italian, he was a farmer, he was a husband and he had a sweet collection of food, and then it's some anti-mutational food.

20:08.412 --> 20:09.394
And he said, I mean, I don't know how to do that.

20:09.414 --> 20:10.315
He said, I mean, I don't know how to do that.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.777
He said, well, I'm just glad to report out some of these things as well.

20:17.292 --> 20:42.355
Oh yes, children, children, look at the space, but you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is, you know what the dream is

20:43.398 --> 21:07.566
... ... ... ...

21:08.947 --> 21:26.476
I have to say, but I've seen my family speak for me.

21:26.496 --> 21:26.977
I know what I mean, son.

21:26.997 --> 21:27.478
I never agree I have to.

21:27.458 --> 21:39.259
I would say it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:39.279 --> 21:40.581
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:40.602 --> 21:41.904
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:41.924 --> 21:43.226
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:43.246 --> 21:44.549
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:44.569 --> 21:45.871
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:45.891 --> 21:47.193
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:47.213 --> 21:48.516
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:48.536 --> 21:49.838
And you see, it's a white cross that we drive that cable back up.

21:49.818 --> 22:14.087
651, we ought to be out there by 553.

22:14.489 --> 22:16.672
Yeah, we've got some time.

22:16.712 --> 22:20.997
Do you want to go to the library?

22:21.017 --> 22:24.181
Or just want to sit around here and nibble on things?

22:24.241 --> 22:28.567
Do I have a chance to change out of my suit, you think, someplace?

22:28.587 --> 22:30.830
Yeah, we can drop my house.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.831
That's just so I can remember.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.856
Yeah, in fact, the three of us, all three traveling to the airport.

22:36.190 --> 22:45.949
They will just drop by my house and we'll use it as a dressing machine.

22:45.969 --> 22:46.029
OK?

22:46.049 --> 22:46.431
Well, this is nice.

22:46.451 --> 22:47.013
I don't know how to do that.

22:47.033 --> 22:47.093
OK.

22:47.113 --> 22:47.314
Thank you.

22:49.167 --> 23:00.843
Thank you so much.

23:00.863 --> 23:14.221
Thank you so much.

23:14.241 --> 23:14.782
Thanks for buying the book.

23:14.802 --> 23:15.463
Oh, well, we're going to go over.

23:15.483 --> 23:15.863
You're coming here.

23:15.883 --> 23:16.264
You're coming here.

23:16.284 --> 23:16.664
You're coming here.

23:16.684 --> 23:17.746
No, one lady said she was doing a talk for two hours.

23:17.766 --> 23:18.026
That's crazy.

23:18.046 --> 23:18.567
A lot of people hear that.

23:18.985 --> 23:30.358
Yeah, but I'll tell you something else about them, too.

23:31.199 --> 23:38.747
As far as the book design goes, they're a cutting edge.

23:38.767 --> 23:41.290
Well, it's over in the glass.

23:41.310 --> 23:43.913
Yeah, when I saw it in the glass.

23:43.893 --> 24:00.519
The reason why I don't know how to roast this tune, the copy that they sent had a badly, because their publisher had badly scuffed.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.644
When they opened up the volume, the spine had separated into a lot of loose sheets.

24:03.664 --> 24:07.150
I haven't said anything yet, and I still haven't figured out how to

24:07.535 --> 24:14.943
That's Cheryl.

24:14.963 --> 24:30.220
That's Cheryl.

24:30.240 --> 24:30.941
She's been with Studio Blue on her.

24:30.961 --> 24:32.002
They appear to have whatever book you've got for it.

24:32.022 --> 24:32.643
Yeah, down there.

24:32.663 --> 24:33.103
Can I come back?

24:46.752 --> 24:47.668
Come on.

26:04.512 --> 26:33.253
Stay at it.

28:36.708 --> 28:39.782
Thank you.

30:23.375 --> 30:27.158
Bye.

30:55.758 --> 30:58.596
Oh.

31:44.695 --> 32:01.943
I'm fine.

32:01.963 --> 32:02.063
Okay.

32:04.220 --> 32:22.007
I was trying to get you to see if you were on camera.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.089
Maybe our sound went to cook and it got a little bit.

32:32.266 --> 32:36.571
Yeah.

32:36.591 --> 32:54.471
Now, do you want to, do you want to, have you got anything to eat?

32:54.491 --> 32:54.591
Here.

32:54.611 --> 32:55.212
I don't want to take anything.

32:55.232 --> 32:55.732
No, here, look over here.

32:55.752 --> 32:56.173
This is cheap, right?

32:56.193 --> 32:56.293
Yeah.

32:56.313 --> 32:57.054
How about, look at these.

32:57.074 --> 32:57.755
I should have brought them to you.

32:57.775 --> 32:58.596
And see, look at these little sandwiches.

32:58.616 --> 32:59.016
I have some of this.

32:59.823 --> 33:19.343
Do you want to take another one?

33:19.363 --> 33:20.025
How do you like it up here, City?

33:20.045 --> 33:20.245
I love it.

33:21.170 --> 33:25.936
Welcome back.

33:25.956 --> 33:29.702
I hope you do too.

33:29.722 --> 33:34.949
It's a beautiful city and a big way to do this.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.751
Well, we can.

33:36.771 --> 33:43.901
It's beautiful and friendly and bright and all the things.

33:43.921 --> 33:44.241
Climate is here.

33:44.261 --> 33:44.622
Isn't it gorgeous?

33:44.642 --> 33:45.082
I would do it for you.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.384
And the value.

33:47.191 --> 33:59.310
I hope to come back.

33:59.370 --> 34:15.375
Thank you, Doctor.

34:16.115 --> 34:33.636
A very nice spread, isn't it?

34:33.816 --> 34:34.217
Thank you.

34:34.317 --> 34:34.938
It was wonderful.

34:34.958 --> 34:37.521
Everyone that comes over to me and told me this.

34:37.781 --> 34:38.142
We will.

34:38.262 --> 34:40.384
We definitely will.

34:40.404 --> 34:43.007
Have you been an inspiration to all of that?

34:43.528 --> 34:45.210
As loners, whatever.

34:45.713 --> 34:48.759
Thank you.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.987
Thank you.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.047
Thank you.

35:03.314 --> 35:18.825
I think we might be on the first leg together.

35:19.902 --> 35:31.628
I can go on the clock.

35:31.648 --> 35:34.815
Is that the tree tree playing up there?

35:34.835 --> 35:34.935
Yeah.

35:34.955 --> 35:35.296
It's pretty cool.

35:35.316 --> 35:35.557
Right there.

35:35.577 --> 35:35.717
At UCL.

35:36.794 --> 35:37.835
The Ransom Center.

35:37.855 --> 35:42.380
On the Ransom Center.

35:42.660 --> 35:50.328
Oh, that is so nice.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.350
Well, sorry.

35:52.611 --> 35:54.993
Oh, it's a car.

35:55.093 --> 35:58.497
Give me one.

35:58.577 --> 36:00.439
It's everything big.

36:00.419 --> 36:05.046
I would appreciate it on my bookshelf, actually.

36:05.326 --> 36:07.770
This is inscribed to the two of you.

36:07.810 --> 36:10.394
This book is inscribed to the two of you.

36:10.414 --> 36:10.714
I know.

36:11.055 --> 36:11.555
Thank you.

36:11.575 --> 36:15.621
I'll send another one.

36:15.641 --> 36:15.882
Great.

36:15.902 --> 36:19.387
I'm going to read your book.

36:19.507 --> 36:20.649
I love you.

36:20.729 --> 36:21.490
Thank you so much.

36:21.851 --> 36:22.832
Thank you so much.

36:22.812 --> 36:26.718
I am definitely a Julio.

36:26.778 --> 36:30.284
I don't know if I'm a file or a maid.

36:30.404 --> 36:30.564
Okay.

36:30.584 --> 36:31.385
Bye-bye.

36:31.486 --> 36:34.210
Thank you so much.

36:34.270 --> 36:38.797
Thanks so much for having us here.

36:38.817 --> 36:40.059
Thanks, sir.

36:40.460 --> 36:43.164
Thanks, Barbara.

36:43.184 --> 36:45.748
Come back again.

36:45.788 --> 36:48.913
By then you'll be cranking out maybe a children's group.

36:48.993 --> 36:50.355
I'd like to, I think.

36:51.010 --> 37:10.318
I'll be in touch.

37:10.298 --> 37:16.004
I want to show you.

37:16.125 --> 37:21.371
He's a fellow in Boston.

37:21.391 --> 37:26.376
He's got a website for librarians.

37:26.436 --> 37:28.459
He's got a course.

37:28.599 --> 37:33.184
It's kind of an educational thing.

37:33.164 --> 37:34.846
I'd like you to be aware of it.

37:34.866 --> 37:36.408
Oh, I'd like to.

37:36.569 --> 37:40.634
Sam will pass on to all the information.

37:40.654 --> 37:43.598
You know, just something to look at.

37:43.658 --> 37:44.259
I appreciate it.

37:44.279 --> 37:44.960
I know I will be.

37:45.060 --> 37:48.545
It's being developed by the Sandman of the Antiques World Show.

37:48.825 --> 37:49.446
Oh, yes.

37:49.606 --> 37:52.590
And this is a guy that does all the educational programs at GEH.

37:52.570 --> 38:14.950
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

38:16.381 --> 38:21.351
I'm just proud about it, I am.

38:21.792 --> 38:25.139
And they had figures that came from the water.

38:26.141 --> 38:26.983
That's pretty, huh?

38:27.063 --> 38:29.328
What's the weather?

38:29.408 --> 38:30.470
Oh, no.

38:30.631 --> 38:32.815
It's nice to see.

38:32.835 --> 38:33.777
You're looking over into the forest now.

38:33.797 --> 38:34.238
I don't know anything.

38:37.863 --> 38:49.746
Well, next time, as I say, like, you know, next day early, and you can tell about the advantages of it.

38:49.766 --> 38:51.349
I'll tell you when I get to the airport.

38:52.021 --> 38:53.102
I love American Airlines.

38:53.383 --> 38:58.610
Your flight to El Paso is canceled.

38:59.050 --> 39:02.815
We had terrible ones with our flight.

39:02.995 --> 39:04.858
Oh, I had terrible ones.

39:05.338 --> 39:06.420
What are you doing?

39:06.440 --> 39:10.705
That was probably the same flight.

39:10.926 --> 39:11.987
We had a, well, you know,

39:11.967 --> 39:18.902
I was supposed to fly from Chicago, and they were going to fly me to Chicago, and my flight here was canceled.

39:19.183 --> 39:21.007
So they stuck me on U.S.

39:21.127 --> 39:25.917
Airways to Pittsburgh, then Pittsburgh to Dallas, and then Dallas to here.

39:26.559 --> 39:31.309
I feel like I've been traveling to Australia.

39:31.289 --> 39:45.602
Thank you.

39:46.375 --> 39:53.209
Oh, that's great.

39:54.251 --> 40:03.169
Oh, that's great.

40:03.149 --> 40:20.253
Well, I have three chapters for my new book as well.

40:20.273 --> 40:20.593
I have chapters.

40:20.613 --> 40:21.715
That is a little bit wider now, but I think that it is.

40:21.695 --> 40:49.744
He's a character.

40:50.180 --> 40:54.781
My kind of guy, you know.

40:54.962 --> 40:59.683
There we go.

41:00.625 --> 41:06.091
I know.

41:06.271 --> 41:08.133
That sounds amazing.

41:08.153 --> 41:20.025
Have you all had a chance to see the other entries?

41:20.545 --> 41:22.087
Oh, I did.

41:23.388 --> 41:26.071
You know, I've never heard a first entry.

41:26.091 --> 41:26.652
I knew about Cheryl.

41:26.672 --> 41:28.033
Hey, Cheryl?

41:28.013 --> 41:30.516
Yeah, we looked at it yesterday.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.237
I'd rather see you upstairs.

41:32.257 --> 41:32.377
Okay.

41:32.397 --> 41:33.819
I want to see the special classes.

41:33.839 --> 41:52.017
A year later, a student called me at the same time as a student.

41:52.037 --> 41:52.958
I don't see them in the same year.

41:54.507 --> 42:08.184
I think her filing Michael Rock so quickly made a big difference.

42:08.945 --> 42:17.376
Yeah, and I wish I could have a chance to interact more with Michael Rock because his aura was still existing.

42:17.626 --> 42:20.009
Uh, you know, Michael got his train in.

42:20.309 --> 42:20.429
Sure.

42:20.449 --> 42:25.515
So, you know, I would be interested in about 35 miles from where you'd like to do it.

42:25.575 --> 42:25.875
I know.

42:26.036 --> 42:30.060
Well, where do you have?

42:33.024 --> 42:39.231
Oh, with that caddy and stuff.

42:39.251 --> 42:40.292
Talking to Uncle Mikey.

42:40.964 --> 42:44.748
And it was, you know, it was amazing how many.

42:44.828 --> 42:46.991
I just got a piece on Barry Moser.

42:47.011 --> 42:47.611
Oh, sure.

42:47.832 --> 42:49.073
Yeah, I went to here.

42:49.153 --> 42:55.400
He says, David, what about your book?

42:55.460 --> 42:57.963
I figured you'd do something on the book arts.

42:57.983 --> 42:58.323
That's right.

42:58.364 --> 43:00.686
But I'd like to do a few stories, you know.

43:00.726 --> 43:02.488
This is a last big book.

43:02.508 --> 43:04.170
I was surprised I wasn't going to.

43:05.011 --> 43:24.252
illustrations and actually talk about that

43:24.232 --> 43:33.924
Well, I can take him over to change and then come back here.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.568
Yeah, come back here now.

43:36.608 --> 43:37.749
Do you want to change here?

43:37.949 --> 43:38.770
We could.

43:38.810 --> 43:42.515
I mean, our bags are right here.

43:42.555 --> 43:45.699
What time do we have to change here?

43:45.959 --> 43:48.923
I can change here.

43:48.903 --> 43:52.290
Let's go to the house.

43:57.681 --> 44:06.118
We should leave for the airport about 5.25 or 5.30.

44:06.335 --> 44:08.238
We have an hour, all right?

44:08.478 --> 44:09.780
We have an hour.

44:10.281 --> 44:13.746
Yeah, so let's go.

44:16.089 --> 44:17.051
We'll be back.

44:17.071 --> 44:23.840
We will be back here.

44:23.981 --> 44:34.536
Okay.

44:34.516 --> 44:56.625
um thank you very much um

44:56.808 --> 45:00.133
You know, I had wanted to continue the conversation about the book as artifacts.

45:00.153 --> 45:02.096
Well, we'll pick up on it.

45:02.236 --> 45:03.999
Excellent, thank you.

45:04.099 --> 45:05.721
And I am having a chapter in this new book.

45:05.781 --> 45:11.169
I'm really interested.

45:11.249 --> 45:25.971
You know, the book really is more than a... And the rubric is...

45:26.474 --> 45:33.345
We've seen all books as we know them now are destined to be museum objects.

45:33.385 --> 45:34.187
That's what they think.

45:34.207 --> 45:35.148
Which is ridiculous.

45:35.348 --> 45:36.110
I think.

45:36.410 --> 45:38.994
They're totally marginalized, and they do.

45:39.075 --> 45:43.081
So I think it's a contrary view on that.

45:43.101 --> 45:46.727
So I'm really interested in getting all kinds of books.

45:47.416 --> 45:51.162
If you have tons or lunch, you should look us up.

45:51.182 --> 45:53.807
Yeah, well, when I'm in Chicago, I'll be there.

45:53.827 --> 45:56.712
Well, your book should be done by then, so we have to pay for that.

45:56.732 --> 45:57.573
Talk to me before that.

45:57.593 --> 45:58.595
Talk to me before that.

45:59.276 --> 46:01.560
Yeah, I have to have this book done in a month.

46:01.580 --> 46:02.522
It's done, supposedly.

46:02.602 --> 46:04.525
Every time you're living, you know, you get something.

46:04.706 --> 46:10.115
Did you touch on Sven Berkerts at all?

46:10.135 --> 46:11.297
How do you come down on him?

46:11.918 --> 46:15.985
I have trouble reading them, if you want to know the truth.

46:16.146 --> 46:16.967
Isn't that?

46:16.987 --> 46:20.714
It's a little cool book.

46:21.255 --> 46:21.435
Oh, cool.

46:21.455 --> 46:21.555
Okay.

46:21.576 --> 46:22.016
It's a wonderful book.

46:22.036 --> 46:22.718
I use that word once in the book.

46:22.738 --> 46:24.341
I love the word opaque.

46:24.361 --> 46:29.590
That's how Hansel Adams described Martin Reagan.

46:29.772 --> 46:39.746
He said his eyes, or he used to photograph his camera, he said his eyes are over haze.

46:39.766 --> 46:41.869
How do you think he had that?

46:44.353 --> 46:54.347
I didn't mean to do it.

46:54.367 --> 46:59.695
Dr. Sharon Fulgin-Fulgin, she's done a lot of thinking and done a lot of work with her and some focus on her back.

47:00.063 --> 47:10.476
I wrote it down when I can't do it.

47:11.997 --> 47:17.965
Do you know where to meet the two of you?

47:17.985 --> 47:19.967
Right here.

47:22.190 --> 47:23.151
Thank you.

47:23.789 --> 47:28.494
You keep notes on it.

47:28.774 --> 47:30.215
You keep notes on it.

47:30.275 --> 47:31.597
You keep notes on it.

47:31.617 --> 47:32.718
You keep notes on it.

47:32.738 --> 47:34.159
You keep notes on it.

47:34.179 --> 47:35.921
You keep notes on it.

47:36.221 --> 47:36.682
You keep notes on it.

47:36.702 --> 47:37.122
You keep notes on it.

47:37.142 --> 47:38.183
You keep notes on it.

47:38.203 --> 47:40.505
You keep notes on it.

47:40.525 --> 47:41.126
You keep notes on it.

47:41.146 --> 47:41.746
You keep notes on it.

47:41.766 --> 47:42.908
You keep notes on it.

47:42.968 --> 47:44.029
You keep notes on it.

47:44.049 --> 47:44.469
You keep notes on it.

47:44.489 --> 47:45.130
You keep notes on it.

47:45.150 --> 47:45.971
You keep notes on it.

47:45.991 --> 47:46.531
You keep notes on it.

47:46.631 --> 47:47.992
You keep notes on it.

47:48.012 --> 47:48.773
You keep notes on it.

47:48.793 --> 47:49.594
You keep notes on it.

47:50.097 --> 47:52.280
Oh, that's fine.

47:52.460 --> 47:54.022
One thing I forgot.

47:55.243 --> 47:59.989
They've got the Bhutan book that I gave them.

48:00.009 --> 48:02.713
It's already up on the special collection staff.

48:02.733 --> 48:04.595
Oh, okay.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.197
It's checked out to me.

48:07.378 --> 48:11.944
I have to return my book soon.

48:13.045 --> 48:15.108
They'll give me some.

48:16.710 --> 48:18.332
Bye-bye.

48:25.231 --> 48:46.266
So, when I hit, I hit myself.

48:46.446 --> 48:48.910
So I have a, you know, I have a...

48:49.700 --> 48:56.571
I'm not going to totally give you the same.

48:56.611 --> 49:06.707
Because there are some very quite ephemeral things that you don't want to put in.

49:06.727 --> 49:12.596
I don't think I'm going to say anything about them.

49:12.636 --> 49:14.599
They're not giving you copies of too far.

49:15.060 --> 49:16.602
Well, yeah, they're great.

49:17.172 --> 49:27.768
I think that I'll just give you an essay called Among the Gently Mad, and I'll certainly work on the Herzog stuff that I did, and the Texas stuff.

49:27.788 --> 49:28.569
And it's good to me.

49:28.649 --> 49:42.790
It'll give me an opportunity to actually put into writing, you know, Among the Gently Mad stuff, exactly in print.

49:42.810 --> 49:44.412
And I think, I don't know this,

49:44.830 --> 49:53.984
The next book is after this one, I'm going to see now, might just be probably fine.

49:54.124 --> 49:59.672
It's a great thing to collect if you had an essay come in.

49:59.692 --> 50:04.379
Two years ahead of a book that's so tired, you know.

50:04.399 --> 50:05.461
There we go.

50:05.481 --> 50:05.801
Cloud Unlimited.

50:05.821 --> 50:06.282
I'll just take this up.

50:21.061 --> 50:22.543
So how pregnant is Cheryl?

50:22.563 --> 50:24.987
Well, the end of April, isn't he?

50:25.067 --> 50:25.448
Really?

50:25.868 --> 50:32.017
And she's out dogging every morning.

50:32.057 --> 50:32.518
Wow.

50:32.698 --> 50:34.802
That's unbelievable.

50:35.202 --> 50:44.436
Well, old Grennan thought I was being an inhuman beast, even suggested.

50:57.528 --> 51:03.799
Maybe a look at another area.

51:03.899 --> 51:06.905
Maybe not even five minutes.

51:07.025 --> 51:11.893
What did you say up there?

51:11.913 --> 51:20.228
That's the old, one of the old, that's going to be moved there downtown, but that's one of the old steam engines that got the early trains.

51:22.773 --> 51:27.259
It's a whole epic piece of meat.

51:27.279 --> 51:33.607
With the exception of a couple of buildings, that's right.

51:33.627 --> 51:35.329
A little pretty serious about that, weren't they?

51:35.349 --> 51:43.359
Well, once they got into it, at least they followed it.

51:43.379 --> 51:47.785
And all from a, I think it's just the main 1914 National Geographic.

51:48.220 --> 52:02.218
It took me a year to put together about three copies of it, one for myself and one for Diana, the president of the university, and another for Special Collections, which didn't have a copy.

52:02.238 --> 52:03.720
What is it again, if I ever see it?

52:03.820 --> 52:12.711
It's either March, April, or May 1914, National Geographic, and the only article in it is on Utah.

52:13.051 --> 52:16.776
So the whole issue was devoted to Utah?

52:16.975 --> 52:28.753
Written by the British political agent.

52:28.773 --> 52:34.562
You get a good look at it when you make a turn.

52:38.002 --> 52:54.443
William Vizner, who's one of our better writers, I've got a copy of an article he wrote, I think it was for the Chronicle of Higher Education, Thank God for the Holiday Inn, which he describes the trials and tribulations he had of going around and speaking.

52:54.463 --> 53:00.390
And as far as academics are concerned, he said, you know, you get the invitation.

53:00.410 --> 53:06.238
And he said, after many years, his first question is, you have a Holiday Inn in town.

53:06.258 --> 53:06.338
Huh?

53:06.807 --> 53:13.677
How many will this place be?

53:13.777 --> 53:14.598
51,000.

53:15.039 --> 53:15.179
Wow.

53:15.699 --> 53:17.282
Now, they didn't carve it out.

53:17.302 --> 53:19.585
Yeah, they had to do a little bit of carving.

53:19.605 --> 53:20.726
A little bit of carving.

53:20.746 --> 53:24.131
Okay, let's do it.

53:24.432 --> 53:29.018
Let's see of miners.

53:30.080 --> 53:33.304
And then here's our basketball arena over here.

53:35.782 --> 53:54.162
Don Haskins, who came here as a high school coach, in his fifth year won the NCAA championship.

53:56.875 --> 54:03.245
and he was the first to kind of tap into the inner-city glass gun.

54:03.265 --> 54:05.148
Oh, well, he did.

54:05.388 --> 54:09.154
That's basically been the story ever since.

54:09.194 --> 54:12.499
Yeah, and everyone else playing all those white guys.

54:12.879 --> 54:20.611
One year, you know, Holy Cross followed and worked there.

54:20.631 --> 54:24.537
And so one year, this has got to be like 20 years ago, they had a pretty good team.

54:26.153 --> 54:28.175
And they were all white.

54:28.195 --> 54:29.997
And they actually made the NCAA.

54:30.017 --> 54:31.399
And I think they even went there.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.222
I think they made the first class.

54:35.864 --> 54:36.785
And they went away, you know.

54:37.365 --> 54:40.068
But the coaches probably said, I can't believe this.

54:40.288 --> 54:42.250
They got an all-white team on the floor.

54:42.270 --> 54:44.793
You know, in this day and age, because they're all white teams.

54:44.853 --> 54:51.801
Well, now, Brigham Young, the Mormon University, they can feel the team like that without any problem.

54:51.821 --> 54:55.024
But they do have a few blacks on their own.

54:55.044 --> 54:55.705
They want to get to see.

54:56.056 --> 55:00.963
We don't have good black ballplayers, forget about it.

55:01.043 --> 55:11.539
And yet everyone suggests that anytime somebody comes up and says that the blacks possess certain inherent physical, they say that's racist.

55:11.659 --> 55:17.828
And the guy who said it said, well, I didn't mean to be racist, but I'm just looking at what the facts are.

55:19.681 --> 55:21.403
Remember before Jimmy the Greek?

55:21.783 --> 55:22.144
Yeah.

55:22.304 --> 55:23.645
Oh, yeah, you got it.

55:24.006 --> 55:25.107
Well, he was stupid.

55:25.267 --> 55:25.788
He's dead.

55:25.808 --> 55:34.337
You know, the guy was basically an ambush interview, and the guy was just having a few drinks in the fire, and the person watching, well, he says it goes back.

55:34.598 --> 55:36.620
He's really stupid.

55:36.680 --> 55:37.361
They grieve.

55:37.381 --> 55:41.686
They bred them for strength, and they can jump better than white.

55:42.226 --> 55:43.768
Well, you know, you put something.

55:43.788 --> 55:45.250
It may be true.

55:45.270 --> 55:48.253
I mean, you know, it's how the racism and the racism experience

55:48.588 --> 56:10.258
I can count the fingers of one hand.

56:10.542 --> 56:15.748
You know, if so long comes Tiger Woods, you know, the dog is pretty much golfing.

56:15.868 --> 56:26.219
But Tiger, you know, Tiger has a massive mix in him, so he can qualify for admission in any university, and he'd just say, well, you know, I'll pick any three of my six.

56:26.320 --> 56:36.691
I mean, he's a genuine mix.

56:36.711 --> 56:39.334
Well, it's on the hot feeling.

56:39.922 --> 56:42.767
And I will be coming tomorrow.

56:42.967 --> 56:44.189
Oh, he is going to be there?

56:44.429 --> 56:45.591
Tomorrow morning.

56:45.671 --> 56:48.576
I'm going to go by the center and see him.

56:48.596 --> 56:48.696
Good.

56:48.716 --> 56:50.038
And then he won't be here tomorrow night.

56:50.058 --> 56:51.521
Well, offer him my best.

56:51.701 --> 56:53.704
You'll be meeting the people down there.

56:53.844 --> 56:56.569
Sue Murphy is the associate director.

56:56.849 --> 56:59.494
And Sally Leach is the associate director.

56:59.554 --> 57:01.677
Oh, okay.

57:01.657 --> 57:05.141
I didn't realize he was still there.

57:05.161 --> 57:08.945
And then Stephen Smith is kind of Tom's administration.

57:08.965 --> 57:10.146
So this is our park.

57:10.527 --> 57:13.009
And our house would try that much.

57:13.210 --> 57:24.862
Not way up, but it's... We come down here with our granddaughter and our daughter.

57:24.882 --> 57:25.403
There we go.

57:32.572 --> 57:36.899
I think you told me there's a pretty crime-free area down here, huh?

57:39.103 --> 57:43.550
We had the lowest crime rate of any large city in the United States.

57:44.411 --> 57:47.636
And with a border location, you think, well, how do you do that?

57:47.656 --> 57:54.327
And the one behind the Mexican-American population, I think,

57:57.563 --> 58:12.626
Yeah, yeah, would you like to take a show?

58:13.047 --> 58:23.082
Yeah, thank you.

58:26.538 --> 58:36.490
I brought a scrungie, the scrungiest old raincoat that's in a ball in here.

58:36.510 --> 58:39.353
You know, the kind of raincoat that you need.

58:39.373 --> 58:48.023
No great loss, right?

58:48.043 --> 58:48.604
Lovely.

58:52.729 --> 58:55.032
And how long have you been here, Frank?

58:55.052 --> 58:55.412
It's 1964.

58:55.512 --> 58:56.173
Really?

58:57.048 --> 58:59.192
There you go.

58:59.513 --> 59:00.394
Thank you.

59:00.414 --> 59:01.296
Bathroom.

59:01.336 --> 59:04.181
Change in your room.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.367
Change here.

59:18.647 --> 59:21.132
Okay, we tried to change in here.

01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:23.456
What?

01:04:23.616 --> 01:04:26.400
What?

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:30.164
Woo-hoo!

01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:55.660
you

01:07:56.727 --> 01:08:03.447
Okay.

01:08:34.105 --> 01:08:36.842
Thank you.

01:08:58.422 --> 01:09:24.557
.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:24.597
.

01:09:24.617 --> 01:09:24.637
.

01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:24.677
.

01:09:24.697 --> 01:09:24.717
.

01:10:40.887 --> 01:11:10.211
.

01:11:10.231 --> 01:11:10.251
.

01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:10.291
.

01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:10.331
.

01:11:10.351 --> 01:11:10.371
.

01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:53.382
His, uh, his, uh, his monumental work in the, in the weird way.

01:11:53.402 --> 01:12:04.962
Well, Vizner recounted that he was preferred holiday in because he'd get picked up, if he got picked up at an airport, uh, by somebody who got lost.

01:12:05.313 --> 01:12:25.847
And, uh, .

01:12:25.867 --> 01:12:30.234
.

01:12:30.254 --> 01:12:30.274
.

01:12:30.777 --> 01:12:46.491
I'm going to pull right up toward the rear.

01:13:05.118 --> 01:13:24.946
Have you got anything in there?

01:13:24.966 --> 01:13:26.008
You've got to have an assist with a lot of students.

01:13:26.028 --> 01:13:27.210
I don't think students are going to have a lot of students.

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:28.712
I don't think students are going to have an assist with a lot of students.

01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:30.214
I don't think students are going to have an assist with a lot of students.

01:13:30.234 --> 01:13:31.716
I don't think students are going to have an assist with a lot of students.

01:13:32.455 --> 01:13:35.547
Thank you.

01:14:37.576 --> 01:14:39.200
Thank you.

01:15:15.747 --> 01:15:38.148
.

01:15:38.168 --> 01:15:38.188
.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:38.228
.

01:15:47.506 --> 01:15:53.219
And if you say, hey, this morning, you're down to jail, and I say, I don't know.

01:15:53.239 --> 01:15:53.500
I don't know.

01:16:19.315 --> 01:16:36.497
Thank you.

01:16:48.323 --> 01:16:54.857
So they took me up, and I'm really good at that.

01:18:02.017 --> 01:18:24.919
Thank you.

01:18:45.031 --> 01:19:12.051
Okay.

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:40.570
so

01:20:06.672 --> 01:20:27.837
Thank you.
