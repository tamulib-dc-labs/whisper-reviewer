00:02.967 --> 00:05.752
So we're talking now with Brian Lamb.

00:05.772 --> 00:08.958
While we just talk about, you mentioned the proceeds.

00:09.198 --> 00:14.808
Well, the reason that, I mean, first of all, I never got into this because I wanted to make money off this.

00:15.669 --> 00:18.154
I'm nicely compensated by the board of directors.

00:19.676 --> 00:24.064
These stories are so interesting, and it helps further the whole discussion of books.

00:24.432 --> 00:52.127
that rather than have people say well what's he doing out hawking a book for we just said let's put all everything every possible proceeds will go into our season educational foundation and then the authors will feel better about it 120 authors won't feel like we're using their materials and so uh it worked it worked very well and it feels good because there's so much in our society that so many people just that's all that matters and that we try to set an example in our little ways

00:52.512 --> 01:13.984
Let me tell you that, you know, I'm in my 50s, 54, and this past New Year's Day, for the first time in memory, I didn't watch a single football game.

01:14.004 --> 01:18.551
The whole day watching what you did on Seasband, and taped it all, by the way, 24 hours worth of tape, of books, books.

01:18.571 --> 01:21.996
I think there's a place, by the way, in this new book, because I'm writing about book culture, the phrase in book culture is part of the subtitle of this new book.

01:23.292 --> 01:33.313
And I want to get to that, but certainly the primary interest is this book of interviews, but you certainly have an attitude about books and book culture in America today.

01:33.714 --> 01:37.061
And you've gone from book notes now to about books.

01:37.081 --> 01:39.166
Maybe that's something ahead of the story.

01:39.206 --> 01:41.270
No, that's an important part of the story.

01:41.290 --> 01:42.212
I think is...

01:42.901 --> 01:57.760
As the years developed, and Book Notes is a little over eight years old, I just kept seeing that this book culture is huge, and television was basically ignoring it except for these humongous bestsellers.

01:57.840 --> 02:08.453
And so we were trying to figure out a way to distinguish C-SPAN 2 from C-SPAN 1 and give people regular viewing of something that has substance to it.

02:08.737 --> 02:12.984
And all of a sudden it just came more and more visible that there's a lot to talk about.

02:13.225 --> 02:20.357
It's a $20 billion industry, something like $4 billion of loans, money spent on Christian books.

02:20.377 --> 02:21.879
I mean, it's mind-boggling.

02:22.360 --> 02:27.148
And there's all kinds of biases and prejudices in the regular media about Christian books.

02:27.169 --> 02:31.195
So we thought maybe this is a chance for us to do a little bit on that.

02:31.396 --> 02:33.900
But the Christian books may have anything to do with why we do it about books.

02:35.163 --> 02:54.010
But now it's regular, and it's the same principle we've applied to everything else in C-SPAN, and that is covering authors and being themselves in a bookstore environment or a lecture series or whatever, and then supplemented with an interview every night on Saturday and Sunday with somebody in the book business.

02:54.030 --> 02:55.092
Well, this is what I like about it.

02:55.112 --> 02:55.973
It's quite just about this.

02:55.953 --> 03:16.066
Because authors are just one aspect of this whole, you've done libraries, you've been up to the Athenaeum, you've been up to Powell's Books.

03:16.086 --> 03:17.649
You've been to the Strand, one of my favorite places.

03:17.669 --> 03:18.831
You go wherever this whole, you've done independent books.

03:18.851 --> 03:19.752
You do the best sellers when they're perfect.

03:19.772 --> 03:20.914
But you really, you look at the authors in this book.

03:22.177 --> 03:26.862
There are a lot of authors in this book that no one's ever heard of, which is great.

03:26.882 --> 03:28.044
And not no one.

03:28.064 --> 03:29.686
The mass market has them.

03:30.767 --> 03:35.072
And they did great works, but for whatever reason, it didn't click.

03:35.232 --> 03:39.317
And hopefully they made enough money to make it all worth their while.

03:39.497 --> 03:42.921
And even if they didn't, they produced something that's of value.

03:42.941 --> 03:44.623
That's of value.

03:45.194 --> 03:46.916
It all started with Neil Sheehan, I guess.

03:47.617 --> 03:50.620
It all started years ago in 88 with Neil Sheehan.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.783
We're about the same age.

03:53.924 --> 04:01.773
The Vietnam War looms heavy in our lives, and Neil Sheehan was rumored to be finishing this book for about 15 years.

04:01.793 --> 04:10.222
And as we got closer to it, one day I remember picking up some document somewhere where somebody had an early run on the book.

04:10.963 --> 04:11.944
And I remember saying,

04:13.004 --> 04:16.508
this man's work can't be dealt with in a six-minute interview on the station.

04:17.369 --> 04:19.291
And that really was how the whole thing started.

04:19.311 --> 04:25.697
I said, let's call him up and ask him if he'll sit with us for a couple of hours, and we can talk about this book from start to finish.

04:25.717 --> 04:26.718
He did it.

04:26.738 --> 04:28.720
We made five 30-minute programs.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.702
We ran them 8 o'clock every night.

04:31.043 --> 04:35.287
And that was really the start of that we have something here that's unique.

04:35.307 --> 04:40.092
Did you get a response that emboldened you to consider going like, hey,

04:40.257 --> 04:46.528
The vital signs, I know when I write a column that appears in 22 newspapers, I love to read it.

04:46.929 --> 04:50.215
I mean, I'm listed in the telephone book.

04:50.315 --> 04:52.820
I let people know what my email address is.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.661
I want to hear from people.

04:53.681 --> 04:54.743
You do the same thing.

04:55.224 --> 05:01.135
The fifth night, he agreed to come to the studio and take calls.

05:01.503 --> 05:03.807
That's when we really knew we had something.

05:03.827 --> 05:08.894
Because the intensity of the calls, the scope of knowledge, was so significant.

05:09.395 --> 05:13.521
That's when you really find out how many Americans there are that really are thinking for a living.

05:13.742 --> 05:20.071
I don't know where you get the statistic, but I'd love to use it in my new book as a matter of fact.

05:20.091 --> 05:22.515
Half of the books that are bought are never read.

05:22.495 --> 05:30.629
Well, that came from an old friend of mine, a fellow by the name of Bob Gorowski, who used to be an NBC correspondent.

05:30.649 --> 05:31.290
He's now dead.

05:32.072 --> 05:33.153
Robert Gorowski.

05:33.234 --> 05:34.376
Yeah, he's a great guy.

05:35.057 --> 05:38.142
And he was, every day was always...

05:38.662 --> 05:40.464
He was a Pentagon correspondent.

05:40.484 --> 05:41.345
I remember I'd go see him.

05:41.705 --> 05:43.187
I was in the Pentagon as a Navy officer.

05:43.747 --> 05:49.393
And I would go see him every day, and every day he would have read the New York Times book review.

05:49.774 --> 05:51.335
It was part of his pattern.

05:51.355 --> 05:52.677
And he would talk about the different books.

05:52.737 --> 05:54.378
And then he started to write books himself.

05:54.418 --> 06:07.352
And one of the things that he did when he went out to speak was tell people that he had a statistic that he got from the American booksellers, and that was, and I think it's changed a bit since then, but 75% of all the books were sold between October and December 25th.

06:07.332 --> 06:10.218
It's basically, you have the right statistic, it's 40%.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.164
And that half the books, they're sold or never read.

06:13.985 --> 06:24.626
And that's probably from, it's an old survey, but I think just from my own experience, people get a gift, put it on the shelf, say thank you very much, and they never go back.

06:24.646 --> 06:26.590
Not just gifts, books that people buy for themselves.

06:27.413 --> 06:49.421
I didn't really have this Dr. Bernard Long who won the Nobel Prize positions against nuclear war.

06:49.441 --> 06:50.963
And he, like myself, he has set up a database for every book in his library.

06:50.983 --> 06:53.806
And one thing he did from the very beginning, as he was entering it in the database, he put down a quote if they'd read it or not.

06:53.826 --> 06:54.567
You know, he's got maybe 5,000 books.

06:54.587 --> 06:55.108
He said, well, guess what?

06:57.468 --> 07:00.712
who's credited with inventing the heart.

07:00.732 --> 07:03.235
We're not talking about some casual reader.

07:03.896 --> 07:04.958
He's at 17%.

07:05.318 --> 07:06.179
Is that right?

07:06.199 --> 07:11.847
17% of the books I own, I can say it with perfect honesty.

07:12.007 --> 07:14.310
Honestly, I've read through from cover to cover.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.092
You know, you have 5,000 books.

07:16.272 --> 07:17.875
I mean, I have maybe 10,000.

07:17.895 --> 07:18.175
I don't know.

07:18.195 --> 07:19.797
I have no idea how many books I own.

07:20.755 --> 07:22.498
That's in the world I've read all of them.

07:22.518 --> 07:27.486
But I know what I have, I know where they are, and I know how they can help me when I need them.

07:27.506 --> 07:30.250
That's what Winston Churchill said is remarkable.

07:31.292 --> 07:37.242
Instead of just an accumulation, is that you know what you have, you know where it is, and you know how it can help you when you need it.

07:37.282 --> 07:42.370
Most books you pick up are not compelling enough to finish.

07:42.410 --> 07:43.892
That's my experience.

07:43.912 --> 07:48.079
They have, and I've often said that a lot of books have, like,

07:48.802 --> 07:52.068
Some of the bad hamburgers, a lot of cereal in them.

07:52.148 --> 07:53.169
They're filler.

07:54.031 --> 07:57.116
And people say, well, we're going to have, how about a 350-page book?

07:57.196 --> 08:00.061
When actually I have a 150-page book that's dynamite.

08:00.402 --> 08:01.223
And so they fill it.

08:01.684 --> 08:11.320
They fill it with a lot of extraneous matters, especially the worst at this, by far, are people who spend time in government, especially former secretaries of state.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.003
University press books have many.

08:12.983 --> 08:22.651
I mean, a 1,000-page book really ever, ever has enough compelling material.

08:22.711 --> 08:31.179
The book for you, Ben Kramer's book, I just think that's a book that really maybe 2% of the people that have it have thought it would be good.

08:31.199 --> 08:36.103
Extraordinary book, though, for politics.

08:36.123 --> 08:38.425
You know what the great mistake was there?

08:38.445 --> 08:40.367
And he did this, he did this perfectly, he left out an index.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.708
You know, anyone's fiction book without an index rules.

08:42.785 --> 08:47.232
We had an interesting experience on the R-index for this book.

08:48.915 --> 08:51.118
It was expensive, as you know.

08:51.940 --> 08:57.709
And they got down to the end, and we were having space discussions and all this stuff.

08:57.769 --> 09:04.259
And in this book, Random House took a long time to make up their mind on whether to put these car photos in there.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.463
Well, in the end, I said, look...

09:08.620 --> 09:12.124
It's that important to us that this book have quality to it.

09:12.144 --> 09:15.928
So we just took some of our advance and put it right back into the color photos.

09:15.948 --> 09:18.531
And then when the index came up, they said, that's going to cost you a grand.

09:19.652 --> 09:20.894
And we said, put it in.

09:21.214 --> 09:27.741
And it was because, as you say, it almost delegitimizes a book when you don't have an index.

09:27.962 --> 09:28.782
It's kind of a crazy thing.

09:28.843 --> 09:33.708
And it's not really, it's not the greatest index I've ever seen.

09:33.768 --> 09:38.273
But this is kind of a book, really, where the interviews are compact.

09:38.742 --> 09:40.944
You go to the author.

09:40.964 --> 09:44.148
You should be able to read the author in five or ten minutes.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.051
You should be able to find what you're looking for with the author.

09:47.071 --> 09:48.193
You should be able to.

09:48.213 --> 10:03.670
Although, one of the things, Nick, and I'm sure you've picked up on it, that we've done with this, which I think is new, is, and this will be interesting to you, is that we've developed a website called www.booknotes.org.

10:04.274 --> 10:10.892
And all 423 transcripts are on that website, the full transcripts.

10:11.783 --> 10:35.648
plus 150 photographs that are an extension of what we have on there right now and one of the things i'm doing i got a camera with me as i go around i'm taking pictures of people that i'm talking to and we're going to put some of those on the website we want people to have a full experience you can get some video clips and some audio clips you can get the music for book notes the albioni uh concerto we have on there and the idea is to

10:37.062 --> 10:48.502
kind of go into cyberspace without losing the value of a beautiful book that can be bought in a bookstore.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.845
You mentioned a terrific introduction, by the way.

10:49.865 --> 10:54.012
It really does answer everything about the program without asking you questions that you've already answered.

10:54.553 --> 11:00.724
You are as interested in the how in this program as you are of the what?

11:01.463 --> 11:02.827
You wouldn't really describe this.

11:02.947 --> 11:05.694
Would you describe this as a hard news interview?

11:05.875 --> 11:06.717
No, absolutely not.

11:07.198 --> 11:12.692
Sometimes hard news is made just because people say the darndest things at the darndest moments.

11:12.712 --> 11:17.565
It's meant to be not a soft interview, but it's meant to be an opportunity for the author

11:18.710 --> 11:24.878
to speak in their voice at a pace that's conversational.

11:25.419 --> 11:25.699
I love it.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.580
That simple.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.863
I mean, there's no more complicated matter.

11:29.003 --> 11:33.429
And sometimes we get a really good interview and sometimes it's okay.

11:33.449 --> 11:38.836
It's really bad, but once in a while you'll have somebody who just can't talk a book.

11:38.856 --> 11:44.143
And as you know, you've got great authors that don't talk well and great talkers that don't write well.

11:44.714 --> 11:50.207
And one of the sad moments, it doesn't happen very often, is when you have a bad book and the author's a great talker.

11:50.708 --> 11:56.962
So it kind of throws out a vibe that not only is this, you know, am I a great interview, but this is a great book and it's not a great book.

11:57.083 --> 12:03.297
But then you should kind of, you should hope to control that on your end before you bring the author out.

12:03.513 --> 12:06.476
In some regards, though, we don't even try to do that.

12:06.496 --> 12:09.518
We don't make a judgment that this is a great book to go on book notes.

12:09.538 --> 12:15.564
We make a judgment that this is a book we're talking about, and the author is worth hearing from.

12:15.584 --> 12:21.670
And you can then go to the store and make up your own mind based on all the little vibes you get in an interview.

12:21.870 --> 12:26.013
And you do post, for those who are computer literate.

12:26.033 --> 12:31.999
It gives the publisher access to the first child of the collection, but go take a look at it.

12:32.019 --> 12:32.119
Yeah.

12:32.673 --> 12:54.631
books you really do have an opportunity to take a look at before you buy it.

12:54.651 --> 12:56.233
Have there, we mentioned hard news, have there been any real surprises for you?

12:56.253 --> 12:58.535
Have you been sitting where the author has really given you something that you totally didn't, that surprised you?

12:58.555 --> 13:01.037
A savvy man who works in Washington in the public, who sees just about everything of significance and goes on in the public.

13:01.057 --> 13:01.797
What is surprised you in the program?

13:01.817 --> 13:02.578
The biggest surprise is in retrospect,

13:02.862 --> 13:27.497
And there is, and no one, I mean, we didn't try real hard, but no one picked up on this, but in the section on leaders, the Bob Dole, and if you haven't seen this, if you go to page 330, here's what Bob Dole said in 1990.

13:27.937 --> 13:32.143
Now remember, in 1990, he was the majority leader in the Senate.

13:32.731 --> 13:38.000
Actually, it might have been the minority.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.903
92, he didn't run.

13:39.923 --> 13:42.427
That was, I think he ran in 88.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.309
He didn't run in 92.

13:43.329 --> 13:45.252
That was George Bush's time.

13:45.272 --> 13:46.474
And then he ran in 96.

13:46.955 --> 13:52.444
But in 1990, Bob Dole said, I don't think I would run for president.

13:53.048 --> 14:18.432
i think probably age is a factor tonight i feel young but you have got to look at the calendar but it would be a long long shot so i would probably not i've enjoyed running for the senate serving in the senate serving in the house we thought we had a pretty good shot in 88 didn't work out we did our best so we'll move on to something else and in retrospect it really kind of said everything that we saw in 1996

14:19.222 --> 14:25.310
You know, as much as he tried, he never was fully engaged.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.174
And it was largely as a result of a very lackluster thing.

14:28.194 --> 14:29.756
It's Michael Lewis.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.458
I just did an interview with him.

14:31.478 --> 14:34.082
You know, this book about trail sherbet.

14:34.222 --> 14:37.406
And he said, you know, it was kind of funny.

14:37.426 --> 14:41.912
He said, the only way you could write a book about this campaign is to really not write about it if you get by drift.

14:41.932 --> 14:44.996
You know, make something else a focus of attention.

14:45.016 --> 14:45.877
And this was boring.

14:46.058 --> 14:48.621
And that's what 49% of the people didn't vote.

14:48.787 --> 14:52.933
But, you know, there's nothing written in the Constitution that says every campaign is going to be exciting.

14:52.953 --> 14:53.213
That's right.

14:53.234 --> 14:57.259
And there are times in our history where the president is the president because he's the president.

14:57.279 --> 15:01.365
And you can't, no matter how much analysis you do, it wouldn't have made any difference.

15:01.426 --> 15:05.231
Bob O'Connor won unless the whole world had changed.

15:05.471 --> 15:11.861
I like the divisions that you have, reporters, storytellers.

15:12.241 --> 15:13.343
Tell me about.

15:17.474 --> 15:26.625
I think it's really important to point out this is 120, it is 120 very interesting interviews, but there does seem to be a narrative pressed to it.

15:26.645 --> 15:28.247
There does seem to be a shape to it.

15:28.267 --> 15:33.973
This is a book that had a lot of people's involvement that mattered.

15:34.053 --> 15:36.717
And what I'm about to say is not lip service to people.

15:36.757 --> 15:39.039
They really mattered.

15:39.059 --> 15:41.202
I've had the rare experience of being able to interview everybody.

15:41.242 --> 15:43.144
So I sit down and just ask the simple question.

15:43.698 --> 15:48.687
Along the way, we've had a number of producers of the program who have been keen and alert.

15:49.648 --> 16:07.279
For instance, Sarah Traherne, who's long gone from us, she works for the Nashville Network now, she was responsible for bringing in guys like Doug Brinkley, who wrote about the Magic Bus, and who we turned into our own public relations educational vehicle, our two big, huge, yellow school buses.

16:07.619 --> 16:09.182
There's a picture of Doug in the book.

16:10.090 --> 16:15.481
So if Sarah hadn't pushed, pushed, pushed for this book about the Magic Bus, we probably would have never done it.

16:16.042 --> 16:22.395
And more importantly, when we got to the Random House Times Brooksby, Jeff Chandler, who's a young, late 20s,

16:24.417 --> 16:28.663
came to us with a lot of very good ideas, very quiet guy.

16:29.124 --> 16:34.933
We sat down and the thrust of what we were going to do with this book was entirely different than what it came up with in the end.

16:34.953 --> 16:45.949
We thought we were going to go categories of ideas, Vietnam, maybe talk about historians, maybe talk about presidents, in another section talk about journalism.

16:46.069 --> 16:52.078
And the more we got to it, we realized the most interesting stories were about writing.

16:52.885 --> 16:55.468
And it might not appeal to everybody, but they were so interesting.

16:55.508 --> 16:58.552
The difficulty with it, or the ease, or how you wrote, where you wrote.

16:59.233 --> 17:04.339
And Jeff helped us very much focus on the different kinds of categories we had.

17:05.040 --> 17:16.114
Robin Scullin, who's pictured in the book with the president at the taping that we had, she labored hours and hours and hours by just going into the different transcripts and pulling out only those sections on writing.

17:16.715 --> 17:21.120
A lot of very good authors that appeared on book notes didn't make it to the book because they didn't say anything about writing.

17:21.100 --> 17:36.679
and so robin had that job of getting all the words on writing and then i would sit down with her and we would go over line by line and take out what we thought was irrelevant jeff would come back in the picture i think we had three line uh

17:36.659 --> 17:40.787
edits, three full line edits that Jeff participated in.

17:41.429 --> 17:42.912
I participated in two of them.

17:43.393 --> 17:47.742
Then another very important part of this was Susan Swain, who you may see on the network.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.688
She hosts some of the programs, and she's also a co-chief operating officer.

17:50.708 --> 17:51.850
She's a very good writer.

17:52.420 --> 18:07.765
Susan came into the process and took her kind of detached view and came back in and said, you know, what she saw was relevant, not relevant, and helped a lot on things like the introduction, the acknowledgments, which we talked about, because she's really good at it.

18:08.246 --> 18:10.028
And so this was a cooperative effort.

18:10.149 --> 18:11.491
Random House Unlimited say that.

18:11.611 --> 18:15.357
They say, when you go out there on the hustings, just tell everybody you're the author.

18:15.337 --> 18:21.247
Well, everything about book notes, everything about C-SPAN is a collective experience.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.071
No one human being makes that big a difference.

18:24.091 --> 18:26.115
And it's the same thing with this book.

18:26.155 --> 18:30.422
This book is not only all the people I name, it's the 120 authors.

18:30.442 --> 18:35.570
Because if we didn't have those wonderful stories, if people were willing to give, we wouldn't have a book.

18:35.810 --> 18:39.376
The work, I have the greatest respect for editors, though.

18:39.677 --> 18:39.977
And...

18:40.463 --> 18:50.355
You have really shaped something here that's really quite... I would call this a synergistic book where the sum is really greater than the parts.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.016
I agree with that.

18:51.877 --> 18:57.063
I mean, it's easy for me to sell this book because earlier I would say I'm not taking any money.

18:57.164 --> 19:00.207
And secondly, these are great authors.

19:00.227 --> 19:02.730
It's just really easy to say to people, go get this.

19:02.871 --> 19:07.536
If you have any interest at all in the written word, you will love this book.

19:07.717 --> 19:08.057
It sucks.

19:08.746 --> 19:30.160
From what I can see, you do have a philosophy of interviewing, and you've touched on it a little bit.

19:30.180 --> 19:34.447
I mean, it's not one of these phobings, I mean, there is a phobing in your own way, but it's not one of these ambush kinds of things where you ask these confrontational questions.

19:34.467 --> 19:35.128
You must have a guiding attitude.

19:35.148 --> 19:36.390
Well, I suffer from having watched a lot of television, and...

19:36.792 --> 19:45.004
I'm just like a lot of people I know that sit out there and watch television interviews and say to the interviewer, shut up.

19:45.024 --> 19:45.888
Get out of the way.

19:46.450 --> 19:47.494
You are bothering me.

19:48.402 --> 19:50.164
I want to hear that author.

19:50.725 --> 20:03.540
And they don't all do that, but we probably bend over backwards going the other way, saying the focus of this interview tonight, I say this in my head every time I sit down, is Nick Fassbaines.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.622
It's David Houserstein.

20:05.642 --> 20:07.164
I want to hear their story.

20:07.845 --> 20:10.809
And we don't have to worry about creating personalities.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.671
We don't sell personalities.

20:12.691 --> 20:13.752
I'm not a personality.

20:14.255 --> 20:21.504
And I learned everything I know about this business from four men that are dedicated, that books dedicated to in the beginning.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.607
And their little philosophies are right there.

20:23.627 --> 20:32.078
And I felt very much that I reflect what they taught me in a small town in Indiana, Lafayette, Indiana, where I grew up, went to school at Purdue.

20:32.579 --> 20:36.744
And these four men, Bill Quacer, Henry Rosenthal, C.J.

20:36.784 --> 20:39.688
Hopkins, and Dick Shywick, had an enormous impact on them.

20:40.748 --> 20:41.169
C.J.

20:41.229 --> 20:45.535
Hopkins, deceased 20 years, was my journalism teacher in high school.

20:45.555 --> 20:52.726
He just literally said, if you want to go into journalism, you got about five or six questions to ask all the time, and the rest will do its work for you.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.893
Who, what, why, where, when, and how.

20:57.493 --> 21:08.090
And I don't know about you, but every time I interview somebody, if I stick to those questions, they're open-ended questions that gives the author a chance to say what they want to say, and you can't miss.

21:08.110 --> 21:09.051
And if you miss...

21:09.672 --> 21:10.935
So what?

21:11.656 --> 21:14.502
That's right.

21:14.522 --> 21:17.188
You're just not going to miss because you're asking the essential questions.

21:17.208 --> 21:17.569
Who are you?

21:17.609 --> 21:18.671
What's the book?

21:18.691 --> 21:23.682
I mean, it almost sounds like I'm too basic, but I can't tell you how many people...

21:24.337 --> 21:42.871
I've given 40 talks since the book came out all over the country.

21:42.891 --> 21:44.995
Universities, libraries, Library of Congress, which you take and talk about books.

21:46.274 --> 21:55.724
Inevitably, somebody will ask, you know, I saw you on C-SPAN, and then they'll want to know about Brian Lamb.

21:55.844 --> 22:03.191
And I say, honestly, I'll say, well, you're the finest interviewer I've ever had the privilege to talk to you.

22:03.211 --> 22:04.633
People say, well, gee, he doesn't talk that much.

22:04.653 --> 22:08.256
I say, well, you're on the track here.

22:08.276 --> 22:13.041
He's giving me the greatest gift I could possibly give, and he's allowing me to have an hour.

22:13.763 --> 22:16.926
Because he's not bringing his ego into the studio.

22:16.946 --> 22:18.968
And plus he is shaping.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.710
He is shaping.

22:21.091 --> 22:23.453
Grace, you asked the first question.

22:23.613 --> 22:28.658
But you also allow me the time to answer.

22:28.678 --> 22:38.349
Where my mind works in one of those programs is I picture someone who has a lot of respect for information and authors sitting out there with the clicker.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.712
And I can just kind of mentally...

22:42.350 --> 22:47.420
feel at some point where they're just about ready to leave us.

22:47.440 --> 22:51.067
And what you want to do at that point is maybe just change the subject a little bit.

22:51.528 --> 23:01.027
If Nick Vassbaines is telling a long story, and we've kind of gotten the essence of it, and he's being himself and doing as best he can, he doesn't realize that it may be a little long.

23:01.248 --> 23:03.312
So I'll then throw in the question, where'd you grow up?

23:03.865 --> 23:05.147
How many kids do you have?

23:05.167 --> 23:05.828
What do they do?

23:06.069 --> 23:06.850
What's your wife do?

23:06.870 --> 23:08.233
I mean, who influenced you?

23:08.253 --> 23:13.302
And then all of a sudden, if somebody's ready to go, say, well, wait a minute, I want to know where this guy's coming from.

23:13.362 --> 23:16.047
So I'll tell you a great story with a book.

23:16.187 --> 23:23.500
It has to be a book note story about somebody who saw me on book notes and told me the next morning.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.924
And it's been Falls of Haven or More story.

23:26.225 --> 23:29.430
which we discussed on the program, At No More.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.132
Oh, you're right.

23:31.273 --> 23:34.057
The mystery man of the book.

23:34.077 --> 23:36.300
Great, great story.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.043
We'll get to that.

23:38.063 --> 23:39.505
What's your time?

23:39.525 --> 23:39.866
I'm okay.

23:39.886 --> 23:44.072
Take your time.

23:44.092 --> 23:45.875
We talked about surprises.

23:46.015 --> 23:49.080
You mentioned the Bob Dole ones.

23:49.100 --> 23:49.961
That's a great story.

23:49.981 --> 23:53.346
Of course, at that time, you had no idea that that was going to be such a...

23:54.355 --> 23:57.541
newsworthy item in retrospect, I guess.

23:57.942 --> 24:08.601
There's a silly but funny moment that we write about in the introduction, and that's Forrest McDonald when I asked him, you know, where does he write and how does he write, and he said he writes in the nude.

24:09.020 --> 24:13.625
And I remember when he said, I said, you write in the nude?

24:13.645 --> 24:15.988
You know, it was just like, where did this come from?

24:16.008 --> 24:31.404
And then he described himself as living 12 miles outside of, in Alabama, outside of one of the major cities down there, and that he lives in the country, and he and his wife live out there, and when he writes, he just takes his clothes off and goes out on the porch and takes his yellow pad and starts writing.

24:31.925 --> 24:37.491
Knowing him, very little, but knowing him, he's a character, and I suspect there's just a bit of an embellishment there.

24:37.842 --> 24:41.306
But we have his picture in the book, but his clothes aren't.

24:41.446 --> 24:48.753
But there are a lot of moments over the years that don't, they don't scream headlines.

24:49.414 --> 24:50.896
They just scream insight.

24:51.676 --> 24:58.483
I'm listening, I'm just... I'm sorry.

24:58.563 --> 25:01.286
...about books, talk about surprises.

25:02.988 --> 25:04.930
And this sounds so...

25:05.382 --> 25:23.076
It's not so obvious, but I didn't even do a Hermione leading this British woman who just did a new biography of Virginia Woolf.

25:23.096 --> 25:23.677
I'm very interested in Woolf.

25:23.697 --> 25:24.679
She was interested in great readers, by the way.

25:24.699 --> 25:25.340
She never was educated normally.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.402
Everything she was was a consequence of her reading.

25:26.422 --> 25:28.386
George Bernard Shaw said, you know, everything he knew he learned from the British Library.

25:29.530 --> 25:37.926
But anyway, when I was doing an interview with her at the end, she had just arrived here in Boston from Great Britain.

25:37.946 --> 25:40.731
She said, I've been told that American interviewers don't read the books.

25:40.951 --> 25:43.255
She said, what a pleasant surprise.

25:43.356 --> 25:45.700
I said, well, I think maybe you don't.

25:45.916 --> 25:50.242
That's a long way of getting into the fact that you do prepare yourself for reading it.

25:50.262 --> 25:50.963
You just read the book.

25:51.224 --> 25:51.784
You read the book.

25:52.185 --> 25:54.729
I just read the book.

25:54.769 --> 25:58.294
No questions are prepared and no researcher does any work.

25:58.775 --> 26:00.016
You just read the book.

26:01.579 --> 26:07.367
We take the attitude that this interview should be able to be pulled out 20 years from now.

26:07.955 --> 26:11.821
just like a book, and stand on its own.

26:11.841 --> 26:19.973
And that you better learn something about the individual, their background, why they got into it, then how they put the book together, and what is in the book.

26:20.914 --> 26:21.375
Not everything.

26:21.395 --> 26:25.922
You want to tease people enough to go out and buy the book.

26:25.942 --> 26:27.163
They want it.

26:27.183 --> 26:30.268
Because you don't want to ruin it for an author.

26:30.468 --> 26:32.511
Authors go around and do these interviews.

26:32.531 --> 26:33.873
You don't want to give up the whole thing.

26:34.174 --> 26:37.659
Remember you said, I think that that was the first time that you would ask some of your questions and I refused to answer it.

26:37.679 --> 26:37.759
Yes.

26:37.739 --> 26:38.861
Which is a good idea.

26:39.121 --> 26:43.849
I said, hey, it took me three and a half years to get the answer to that.

26:43.870 --> 26:48.157
You don't have to answer a question, by the way, to make it a good interview.

26:48.177 --> 26:51.503
But you do have to answer a lot of interesting background information.

26:51.523 --> 26:55.069
So people say, well, that guy's substantial enough.

26:55.089 --> 26:55.790
I'm going to go buy the book.

26:56.391 --> 26:58.735
I will tell you the haven of more story.

26:59.913 --> 27:25.937
the first time my interview was broadcast was in october of 95 and there was broadcast again big christmas it was a pretty popular it was popular it was december 29th and it was friday night the next morning i got a telephone call from a lawyer in the midwest kansas and he said mr basbane he said i was surfing with the

27:25.917 --> 27:39.895
to television last night looking for the Kansas football game, and he came upon the C-SPAN interview, and just like you say, he flies for a while, and he heard the name, he said, Cavan O'Moore, and I corrected him, it's Haven.

27:40.255 --> 27:43.239
He said, wait a minute, I know this guy.

27:43.259 --> 27:52.551
Turns out this guy is a lawyer, and he said, do you know about the case involved in Haven O'Moore that took place out here in Kansas?

27:52.571 --> 27:53.292
I don't need this update.

27:55.094 --> 27:56.816
You read, obviously.

27:57.096 --> 28:02.903
Do you read much for pleasure these days, or do you read mainly now for work?

28:02.923 --> 28:12.995
Once in a while, but frankly, I'm not a fast reader, so I have to stay at the book notes book every week, all the time, because my days are long.

28:13.095 --> 28:18.642
I have 12-hour days, and so I have to read it early in the morning, late at night, or weekends.

28:18.682 --> 28:21.625
And I read newspapers for pleasure.

28:22.938 --> 28:26.383
There's an awful lot of information in some good newspapers.

28:26.403 --> 28:31.891
In Washington, we have four or five really good newspapers to read.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.634
None of us have enough time to read as much as we like to.

28:34.654 --> 28:35.896
Do you read any fiction?

28:35.916 --> 28:36.116
No.

28:37.198 --> 28:40.923
I read fiction when I was in college because it was part of the classics that I had to read.

28:41.884 --> 28:50.076
I read a book that had a tremendous impact on me because it was so much fun, and that was Bonfire of the Vanities.

28:50.276 --> 28:51.578
It turned out to be...

28:52.199 --> 28:55.223
accurate about five years in advance.

28:55.924 --> 28:59.849
It is the book of the 1980s, the novel of the 1980s.

29:00.169 --> 29:05.476
But I'm not drawn to fiction because there's so many great stories in nonfiction.

29:05.496 --> 29:10.382
You just don't happen to be that interested in it.

29:10.463 --> 29:13.006
And a lot of people ask me why we don't do fiction.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.610
It's about books we do from time to time because it's political fiction.

29:16.630 --> 29:21.717
And that does allow you unabove books to kind of cover areas that you don't.

29:22.928 --> 29:48.379
absolutely i mean it does absolutely gives you the opportunity to do things and it also enables you to answer people and say well gee you know do this on book notes but yeah they're doing a lot about books and we can't get to even you know 100 to the authors and that's also a chance for us to do offers that we can't get to for book notes because sometimes it just doesn't work out timing doesn't work out

29:49.051 --> 29:55.748
But the ambiance is nice.

29:55.768 --> 30:02.605
You do kind of go out into the field, you go into bookstores, you go into libraries, you go to places, you go to panels, you go to conferences and things, and so the viewer does get a sense of the ambiance.

30:03.412 --> 30:28.626
to do those harry evans breakfasts yes uh which can be kind of you know eccentric to be sure but lots of fun and harry evans has a rather important post in publishing and then usually uh i can't think of you know i think we have lots of stuff here do you need a look anywhere by no i don't but don't go away i want to take a picture right there i'm trying to capture

30:28.994 --> 30:54.931
I got my hook tie on here.

30:54.951 --> 30:55.232
I'm back home.

30:55.252 --> 30:55.712
Right next week's call.

30:55.732 --> 30:56.013
I'll tell you.

30:56.033 --> 30:56.233
Largely...

30:58.340 --> 31:01.784
Basically, I would say where your program is.

31:02.765 --> 31:04.127
I mean, mainly university towns.

31:06.930 --> 31:07.070
Really?

31:07.090 --> 31:08.332
That was my concept.

31:08.592 --> 31:13.077
What's your biggest goal?

31:13.097 --> 31:17.202
Oh, I'm in Madison, Wisconsin State Journal in Austin.

31:17.222 --> 31:18.884
I'm in Salt Lake City.

31:18.904 --> 31:19.585
And I did this myself.

31:19.605 --> 31:20.486
I have two cards.

31:20.506 --> 31:21.527
I'll give you my cards.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.449
It's great.

31:23.469 --> 31:25.011
This is my regular order.

31:25.031 --> 31:26.693
Next, I'll give you my email on it.

31:28.529 --> 31:57.591
what i did was nice thing about that those are capital cities that's that was the whole idea that's i made what i did is i made literary future syndicate that's my and i made myself to manage and so what i do is and this exists to sell my column every week it's a weekly column of about a thousand words which is long and then that's just my way to get it out there which you know just my name

31:58.448 --> 32:04.155
Did I send you the piece that the boss did on me last year?

32:04.456 --> 32:09.043
Because I think it was the one I had a picture of you.

32:09.203 --> 32:11.867
Yeah, it was a nice picture, yeah.

32:11.968 --> 32:18.077
And what happened, I desperately wanted to get up and take your picture.

32:18.317 --> 32:20.300
I desperately wanted to do it.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.445
My wife is really, she says, you still cast a picture in the California.

32:23.886 --> 32:25.368
Oh, what a story I got out of California.

32:25.488 --> 32:28.313
I mean, you talked about, this is going to be in the news.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.997
This is a guy by the name of Lloyd Hootson, C-O-T-S-E-O.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.180
He recently sold the Eucatina company for a billion dollars.

32:34.055 --> 32:47.358
And he is now putting together the world's, he's put together the world's finest collection of children's books.

32:47.378 --> 32:50.443
Now, he's giving it all to Princeton with a building and with perhaps 50 million dollars to set it up.

32:50.463 --> 32:50.864
But there's a catch.

32:50.884 --> 32:52.506
And the catch, you get the catch out of my book, The Gentle Madness.

32:52.526 --> 32:52.907
And the peep story?

32:56.583 --> 33:17.954
to bring in the minority community, and this is Princeton, which is about, you know, the populist of Ivy League schools, which are having 50,000 kids coming in from Newark and Charlton and all over the year to interact with the folks.

33:17.974 --> 33:18.515
They don't want to do that.

33:18.535 --> 33:19.536
He told them, if you don't do it within two years,

33:19.972 --> 33:25.301
Everything comes and goes out to UCLA.

33:25.321 --> 33:42.812
But what makes the story so spectacular, because I also want to write about literacy, but better than write about literacy than a person who is committing and feeding all his children into reading, into the future.

33:42.832 --> 33:44.595
And now, if you're a journalist, you walk into this home that he has in Los Angeles,

33:44.575 --> 33:48.741
I was already given everything over to Princeton.

33:48.821 --> 33:59.658
And you walk in and there are 150 goers' arts all over the house, 400 years old, 500 years old, really artworks.

33:59.678 --> 34:02.302
And I said, let's put the goers out.

34:02.322 --> 34:04.144
I knew the background.

34:04.164 --> 34:11.275
The kicker is, in 1978 and 1979, and I'm the only person here to talk to you about this.

34:12.267 --> 34:22.165
His son and his wife were murdered brutally, had someone who was stalking him.

34:22.847 --> 34:29.419
This was some guy from Belgium who had come here, killed some people in Canada, came down to L.A.

34:29.439 --> 34:32.524
trying to find him, couldn't find him, and just a horrible, horrible story.

34:32.544 --> 34:34.528
And so what he's doing now, of course, and the boy's name is Noah.

34:35.858 --> 34:55.927
I think this story in the new book is as great as the Bloomberg story or the Moore story.

34:55.947 --> 34:56.928
And what he's doing, he's driven to do something.

34:56.948 --> 34:57.529
The children and the reading.

34:57.863 --> 35:15.603
And I spent two days with him, and he's never talked to anybody about this.

35:15.623 --> 35:16.704
And he's only talked in general terms about the world.

35:16.724 --> 35:17.465
And that's, you know, what I respect.

35:17.485 --> 35:17.765
How old is it?

35:17.785 --> 35:18.146
He's 70 right now.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.427
And he's, when I was signing books in L.A., I signed 450 books.

35:19.447 --> 35:20.108
This is when the gentleman read.

35:20.128 --> 35:20.448
This is amazing.

35:20.468 --> 35:21.289
And this tall, good-looking guy comes up.

35:21.910 --> 35:34.545
He said, Mr. Basman, Lloyd Coatsen.

35:34.565 --> 35:34.866
And I stood up.

35:34.886 --> 35:37.709
I said, Mr. Coatsen, and I could pass to talk to him for Gentle Madness.

35:37.729 --> 35:39.011
He did fine.

35:39.031 --> 35:41.293
He said, my friends tell me they can't believe I had a chance to be in Gentle Madness, and I turned it down.

35:41.313 --> 35:41.894
And I said, well, guess what?

35:41.914 --> 35:42.435
You've got another chance.

35:42.455 --> 35:44.357
I said, I'm working on another book that I think is even going to be more important, because...

35:45.113 --> 36:01.131
You know, the threshold in the last book, there were two.

36:01.151 --> 36:02.593
Good stories and collecting, right?

36:02.613 --> 36:03.814
Now, of course, collecting is, that's here.

36:03.835 --> 36:07.479
Now, I'm going to have collectors in the new book, but they have to be somebody like Kochi, who's doing the collecting to promote literacy, to create a great library, to help people.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.501
So that's how the collectors, if there are collectors in the new book, that's how they all get in.

36:09.481 --> 36:24.829
This guy over at Harvard traveling the world to get every copy of Copernicus.

36:24.849 --> 36:28.977
You know, there's a 200-year, talking about bibliography, the Vatican Library in Rome is embarked on a 200-year program to do a complete bibliography of the works of St.

36:28.997 --> 36:29.297
Thomas Aquinas.

36:29.317 --> 36:29.818
That's how long it takes.

36:29.838 --> 36:30.780
Imagine committing yourself 100 years.

36:31.351 --> 36:52.121
That'll be done sometime in the year 21, but they've already been doing it for 40 or 50 years.

36:52.141 --> 36:52.221
Why?

36:52.241 --> 36:52.662
Why 200 years on one?

36:52.682 --> 36:53.243
You know, we measure things.

36:53.263 --> 36:54.104
Computers are never going to replace that.

36:54.124 --> 36:55.546
There's always going to be a... By the way, I know you don't go for it.

36:55.566 --> 36:56.107
Can you describe this book?

36:56.127 --> 36:56.227
Sure.

36:56.247 --> 36:56.668
Before I forget here.

36:56.688 --> 36:57.289
I think I got to use this one.

36:57.309 --> 36:57.409
Okay.

36:58.840 --> 37:16.742
Is that what you use when you do it?

37:16.762 --> 37:17.302
My wife gave me that to us.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.105
She kind of gave it to us, say, Boston.

37:19.125 --> 37:23.430
And what I'll do now, by the way, is I'll call Random House when I get back.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.651
And what I need is 25 pictures of you, publicity pictures.

37:24.671 --> 37:25.392
Do you like Nick or Nick with that?

37:25.412 --> 37:25.673
Nick is fine.

37:25.693 --> 37:25.933
I like both.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.615
Formality is Nicholas, my friend, because I like Nick.

37:28.760 --> 37:33.807
Yeah, well, so Mike, let's see, the papers that I have are Salt Lake City.

37:33.847 --> 37:57.940
The concept was, by the way, it's very similar to your book notes concept, is that if my newspaper in Worcester had decided that they could no longer afford the luxury of a book editor, but they still have people who like to read about books and don't want the crap that comes in off the wires, then there must be lots of cities all over the country that feel the same way.

37:59.523 --> 38:02.491
And what I did then is determine where are you going to find the readers?

38:03.914 --> 38:06.080
In capital cities and in university towns.

38:07.023 --> 38:10.431
And these are also cities where they don't have access to the authors.

38:10.451 --> 38:12.076
And I get access to all the authors.

38:12.096 --> 38:13.179
They all come through here.

38:13.199 --> 38:15.304
The ones that don't go here, I go to New York to do.

38:16.280 --> 38:23.070
So I started pitching myself and dissecting my poems, which speak for themselves.

38:23.231 --> 38:23.751
They're wonderful.

38:24.012 --> 38:24.893
I mean, they are.

38:24.913 --> 38:25.855
They're good.

38:25.875 --> 38:32.545
So doing this by myself, I'm in Salt Lake City, Eugene, Oregon.

38:32.565 --> 38:33.406
Eugene, Oregon.

38:33.426 --> 38:34.508
University of Oregon.

38:34.488 --> 38:38.993
I'm in Charlottesville, University of Virginia.

38:39.013 --> 38:40.255
I'm in Gainesville, University of Florida.

38:40.275 --> 38:53.851
I'm in Jackson, Mississippi, which is the paper in all of Mississippi.

38:53.871 --> 38:56.414
I'm in the three villes, Gainesville, Charlottesville, and Knoxville.

38:56.434 --> 38:56.774
I'm in Knoxville.

38:56.794 --> 38:58.456
I'm in Grand Rapids.

38:58.476 --> 38:58.757
I'm in Toledo.

38:58.777 --> 38:59.878
This is every week.

38:59.898 --> 39:00.439
I'm in Columbus.

39:00.459 --> 39:00.939
I'm in Madison.

39:00.959 --> 39:01.340
I'm in Austin.

39:01.360 --> 39:01.740
You're Captain.

39:01.760 --> 39:02.121
Everywhere I go.

39:02.141 --> 39:02.781
I'm in Wichita, Barbell Country.

39:02.801 --> 39:04.123
That's a Wichita Eagle.

39:04.103 --> 39:05.284
I anchor the page.

39:06.946 --> 39:11.091
Basically, everywhere I go, I anchor the page.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.274
And of course, they all say, well, we can't take long stories.

39:15.075 --> 39:18.319
Everybody I write for it, I do a 1,000-word story.

39:18.619 --> 39:19.700
900 words.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.843
That's 30 inches.

39:21.883 --> 39:22.884
They run it.

39:23.124 --> 39:27.589
But these people, and they love to read the story.

39:27.609 --> 39:29.631
They love to read about my life.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.154
They love to read about Donald's fault at court.

39:32.174 --> 39:33.756
They want to read about...

39:34.327 --> 39:37.031
I really stay away from the best sellers.

39:37.171 --> 39:42.638
What was your philosophy as you went about signing?

39:42.658 --> 39:44.580
Did you write messages?

39:45.942 --> 39:51.810
It's funny because they were taking bets, the booksellers, out in L.A.

39:52.972 --> 39:54.894
It was a line 100 yards long.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.477
When I signed in Washington, we signed 200 books.

39:57.497 --> 39:58.218
That's where I started.

39:58.238 --> 39:59.440
In fact, the weekend we did

39:59.842 --> 40:18.188
that interview i was signing that weekend and they were lined up 100 yeah 12. and i would say geez i'm sorry and they said just do what you're doing because i would ask everybody what they do what do they collect and i would write

40:18.674 --> 40:22.999
a personal thing with so-and-so.

40:23.019 --> 40:27.744
I was a former naval officer.

40:27.764 --> 40:35.793
Oh, I'm a former naval officer.

40:35.813 --> 40:36.373
Somebody's from New England.

40:36.393 --> 40:38.195
I've mentioned something from New England.

40:38.215 --> 40:39.396
He's a physician who collects books on medicine or geology.

40:39.416 --> 40:41.178
I've mentioned that in the inscription.

40:41.198 --> 40:41.779
And so I've kind of become...

40:41.759 --> 40:45.445
pretty well known for my inscriptions.

40:45.465 --> 40:49.852
But of course these take time, and the lines would be long.

40:49.872 --> 40:51.975
I would say, do you want me to speed it up?

40:51.995 --> 40:54.500
They'd say, no, no, just take your time.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.603
They could see what I was doing with them.

40:56.623 --> 41:05.978
And then when I got out to San Francisco last fall, the ABAA, the Antiquarian Booksellers, had bought 1,000 first editions of my book.

41:06.650 --> 41:30.902
the book is now going for 125 bucks so they had and they sold them all except there were 50 left there were 50 left in san francisco so they said the last 50 were selling for 100 bucks a piece with the proceeds to go to their benevolent point i mean i'm not profiting from this you know zero i just got my regular loyalty and then they also have the fifth printing there

41:31.760 --> 41:34.167
So what do you think sold out?

41:34.829 --> 41:36.855
Not the fifth printing at 35 bucks a whack.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.062
The first printing was at 100 bucks a whack.

41:39.082 --> 41:40.767
Sold them out like that.

41:40.787 --> 41:42.111
So you're in your fifth printing?

41:42.131 --> 41:43.033
I'm in my sixth.

41:43.455 --> 41:43.575
Sixth.

41:43.927 --> 42:08.584
how many did they do each time uh this last one was pretty big uh every one was larger than the earlier first one was 6400 so they're always 6400 the next one was like 7 000 the next one was smaller the second printing they said well maybe it's a fluke and then that was gone in a week we had three printings within the first month of publication and then the fourth was huge

42:08.918 --> 42:14.013
And then the fifth was larger, and then the sixth was about $20,000.

42:14.034 --> 42:18.447
And that's going to be around for a while, because sales have trickled now.

42:18.507 --> 42:22.118
They say we're moving between $100 and $200 a month now, which is still not bad.

42:22.823 --> 42:26.830
Going up to Christmas, we were moving 500 a month.

42:27.150 --> 42:31.157
And there's only been two ads from the day the book came out.

42:31.858 --> 42:34.302
One in the New York Times, one in the New York News.

42:34.322 --> 42:36.466
Everything else has been good press.

42:36.926 --> 42:39.651
Bookshallers love it.

42:39.968 --> 42:55.274
Hasn't been a bad review anywhere, and good reviews.

42:55.294 --> 42:56.736
Dierta gave it a full-page review.

42:56.757 --> 42:58.119
You should get Michael on your show.

42:58.139 --> 42:59.942
He's the book critic for the Washington Post.

42:59.962 --> 43:00.062
Very.

43:00.082 --> 43:01.164
Pulitzer Prize winner, he's a critic.

43:01.184 --> 43:01.685
Very, very knowledgeable.

43:01.705 --> 43:02.566
I don't know if you can get our book notes.

43:02.586 --> 43:03.388
That's an author thing, but about books.

43:03.408 --> 43:04.710
We don't want to interfere with this process right now.

43:04.690 --> 43:10.378
I'll move this right out there.

43:11.239 --> 43:20.571
So I get 22 papers, total circulation of three and a half million.

43:20.872 --> 43:25.558
You'll be one of the early reviews.

43:25.578 --> 43:31.926
And again, it's a combination review with reviews.

43:31.946 --> 43:33.128
So that way I can

43:34.120 --> 43:36.022
Plus, they read.

43:36.262 --> 43:37.043
They know me.

43:37.123 --> 43:38.124
My readers know me.

43:38.144 --> 43:40.487
And I think your viewers know you.

43:41.368 --> 43:43.390
And when I ask you what you read, well, they know that.

43:44.071 --> 43:51.459
We're not going to go to your program to see, you know, whomever.

43:51.519 --> 43:54.242
Sarah Koretsky, you know, Daniel.

43:54.262 --> 43:56.364
So you have to come to see her, Daniel.

43:56.384 --> 43:57.826
Although I will every once in a while.

43:57.846 --> 44:01.730
I'll do a bear this summer.

44:01.750 --> 44:02.811
I think there's a good story, you know.

44:03.280 --> 44:09.889
Robert B. Parker, because I like Bob Parker, he's an interesting guy.

44:09.909 --> 44:19.783
George Higgins, friends of Eddie Coyle, and you can talk about what it's like to have your first book be the friends of Eddie Coyle, and then nobody can name the next 20 after that.

44:19.803 --> 44:24.951
And then he'll say something, well, I wanted to know, didn't great Joe Heller to have his first book be X-22.

44:24.971 --> 44:27.835
I can live with that.

44:27.855 --> 44:29.297
I can live with that.

44:29.317 --> 44:30.098
So that makes it a good story.

44:31.664 --> 44:41.878
It'd be interesting to know what a lot of authors who have a success and never come back do with their lives.

44:41.898 --> 44:46.103
Because you keep thinking, I mean, what does J.D.

44:46.123 --> 44:46.904
Sollinger do in his life?

44:46.924 --> 44:47.926
What has he done over?

44:47.946 --> 44:48.787
Well, I think he's terrified of it.

44:48.807 --> 44:49.929
I've thought about that myself.

44:49.949 --> 44:51.631
Harper Lee is alive and apparently well.

44:51.651 --> 44:53.493
And she wrote that one book, Phil Mockingbird.

44:54.314 --> 44:56.217
That's it.

44:56.237 --> 44:58.420
Margaret Mitchell wrote From Here to Eternity.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.241
That's it.

44:59.221 --> 45:00.442
Never another book.

45:00.702 --> 45:04.586
The guy who killed himself wrote Raintree County.

45:05.207 --> 45:06.748
I mean, you know, who knows?

45:06.768 --> 45:08.190
That was the only book he wrote.

45:09.011 --> 45:12.254
I have to believe that there's... I'm not intimidated by it at all.

45:13.255 --> 45:17.199
I'm not either, but I... Of course I know, because I've talked to authors.

45:17.219 --> 45:26.448
And they'll tell you, you know, when you've had such a tremendous success the first time out, you find it intimidating to do it, to do the next one.

45:26.468 --> 45:27.709
And a lot of them say, yeah.

45:28.330 --> 45:30.673
for myself, but my success is modest.

45:30.693 --> 45:39.125
I mean, it's certainly not sales compared to anybody else, other people, but, you know, in its own field, it's respected, and then it's respected.

45:39.145 --> 45:41.549
That's the great part.

45:41.569 --> 45:47.537
You point that out, I believe, in here, that it's when your peers

45:47.517 --> 45:51.546
This is another book I'm just reading, Two-Bit Culture.

45:51.626 --> 45:52.648
Have you ever read that book?

45:52.668 --> 45:55.855
1984, it's about the paperbacking of America.

45:55.876 --> 45:57.479
Very, very interesting book.

45:57.499 --> 46:01.328
It's called Two-Bit Culture, 1984, by a guy named Kenneth.

46:01.568 --> 46:03.392
I was reading it for research on this new book.

46:04.555 --> 46:06.960
And that's how the paperback changed.

46:07.244 --> 46:25.455
And the best-selling book in American history

46:25.807 --> 46:49.502
after the bible if i were to ask you what do you suppose it is yes anytime yeah well it's paper it's obviously a paperback and well it's dr spock's book on child and baby care 1949 and i don't know this in 1984 was like 50 million copies god knows what it is now one of the reasons it was successful

46:49.482 --> 47:07.846
there have been other books on babies, is because it had the immediate respect and admiration of his peers of other medical people.

47:07.886 --> 47:09.028
They liked it.

47:09.048 --> 47:10.129
They recommended it.

47:10.149 --> 47:12.673
And I look at it in a microcosmic way.

47:12.693 --> 47:16.097
One of the things that's helped my book along is that everybody in the library, everybody in the professional communities

47:17.005 --> 47:25.796
No, I think Spock made $50 million.

47:25.816 --> 47:25.996
Say what?

47:26.016 --> 47:26.897
I think he made $50 million.

47:26.917 --> 47:28.079
No, it's very funny.

47:28.099 --> 47:36.149
He said in the years of product Spock, when he was making, when he was selling a million copies a year, he was only making $5,000 a year.

47:36.169 --> 47:38.212
He acted as, he was only getting a half a penny for a book.

47:38.232 --> 47:42.557
It was finally when he signed his contracts for the books that followed that he started to make some money on the book.

47:42.942 --> 47:57.337
But, you know, his paper, we don't forget, they were selling it for 25 cents a lot.

47:57.357 --> 47:58.699
His royalty was one cap a penny.

47:58.719 --> 48:02.002
So if they sold a million, it was like five bucks.

48:02.022 --> 48:02.563
That's all he made.

48:02.583 --> 48:03.704
So he didn't really make a fortune on it.

48:03.724 --> 48:04.925
But he was a gold medalist in the Olympics.

48:04.945 --> 48:05.826
And it was very interesting.

48:05.846 --> 48:06.647
So this book was called Two-Bit Culture.

48:06.667 --> 48:08.209
It's very interesting.

48:08.229 --> 48:08.830
There are parallels.

48:08.850 --> 48:10.131
The paperback is only 60 years old.

48:11.545 --> 48:19.051
It has a mass market item.

48:19.131 --> 48:28.359
1939 is when it came out.

48:28.379 --> 48:30.381
You know, things have changed.

48:30.401 --> 48:33.824
People get their culture, I guess, and tourism.

48:33.844 --> 48:35.866
Yeah, there's a big change, but there's still awful lot of things being sold.

48:35.886 --> 48:36.666
That's right, that's right.

48:36.686 --> 48:39.088
Of course, when you think of paperbacks, they are absolutely made to be disposable.

48:39.108 --> 48:39.729
They don't even send them back.

48:39.749 --> 48:41.130
They don't send them back, and so you think in terms of preservation.

48:41.583 --> 48:43.207
I've enjoyed this enormously.

48:43.888 --> 48:46.594
Are you sure I can't give you a lift to go to the airport?

48:46.654 --> 48:47.897
No, I'm over to Lennox.

48:47.997 --> 48:48.579
I'm over to Lennox.

48:48.599 --> 48:48.899
Okay.

48:48.919 --> 48:50.663
I've got a car and I'm heading up north to Maine.

48:50.683 --> 48:51.706
Oh, great.

48:51.726 --> 48:52.768
Where do you go to Maine?

48:52.788 --> 48:54.973
Friends of mine have a place up at Damascada.

48:54.993 --> 48:56.336
Oh, that's nice.

48:56.356 --> 48:58.481
I went to college up in Maine.

48:58.842 --> 48:59.082
Bates.

48:59.303 --> 48:59.423
Bates.

48:59.723 --> 49:01.026
Bowdoin was our one.

49:01.046 --> 49:03.391
I've been to Bowdoin and I've been to Cobra.

49:03.411 --> 49:05.034
I haven't been to Bates.

49:05.054 --> 49:05.836
Well, two out of three.

49:05.856 --> 49:06.437
Good schools.

49:06.718 --> 49:08.842
So Bates is a great school.

49:09.544 --> 49:10.065
Where's Bates?

49:10.125 --> 49:13.452
It's in Lewiston, which is a forgettable city.

49:13.472 --> 49:14.053
But the college is wonderful.

49:14.759 --> 49:26.318
I guess Bowdoin is a little more towards this.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.019
It's a great place to be going to.

49:27.039 --> 49:27.980
If I don't let him go off the traffic, you are.

49:28.000 --> 49:28.802
You should get going as soon as you can.

49:28.822 --> 49:29.723
I was listening to the reports on the way in.

49:29.743 --> 49:30.945
Especially, you've got to go up through the Hamptons Coles.

49:31.448 --> 49:51.604
I'll get going as soon as I could if I were you.

49:51.624 --> 49:52.125
You're leaving right now?

49:52.145 --> 49:52.245
Yeah.

49:52.265 --> 49:52.385
Do it.

49:52.405 --> 49:52.986
Let's walk back in the hotel.

49:53.006 --> 49:53.207
All right.

49:53.227 --> 49:55.110
Here we go.

49:55.546 --> 50:17.972
I'm doing parents next week.

50:17.992 --> 50:19.894
Next week is that the one day for the week I come back, and then I'll do this when I come back.

50:19.914 --> 50:20.575
And that way I'll have the photo.

50:25.178 --> 50:48.671
Oh, no, thank you.

50:48.691 --> 50:49.192
I'm not supposed to grab.

50:49.212 --> 50:49.652
Oh, that's ridiculous.

50:49.672 --> 50:49.852
Oh, okay.

50:49.873 --> 50:51.675
That's just one collection out of, uh... The houses really grow under the... David Brooks.

50:52.803 --> 51:11.622
because i collect book things too you know like old bookcases

51:28.915 --> 51:32.091
I'm going to have a little bit more.

52:09.398 --> 52:11.595
He's jealous.

52:59.146 --> 53:26.520
Oh, my God.

53:32.035 --> 53:57.351
The End

54:00.605 --> 54:19.103
THE END

54:32.971 --> 54:35.843
The End

55:12.374 --> 55:24.358
The End

56:37.154 --> 57:03.510
.

57:03.530 --> 57:03.550
.

57:10.516 --> 57:26.955
Thank you.

57:37.280 --> 57:42.210
The End

58:05.343 --> 58:27.283
THE END

58:32.748 --> 58:56.528
Oh, God.

59:01.705 --> 59:05.640
Oh.

01:00:05.847 --> 01:00:10.305
The End
