00:03.642 --> 00:06.886
It doesn't always work with me, but this feeling that you can get ahead of yourself.

00:06.986 --> 00:08.408
I always like to get ahead of myself.

00:09.349 --> 00:13.114
I don't like to set myself a target which I know I can't with.

00:13.134 --> 00:15.477
I like to feel I'm well ahead and well out.

00:15.497 --> 00:18.220
I tend to do by the week rather than by the day.

00:18.260 --> 00:18.601
Really?

00:19.302 --> 00:22.306
And do you actually measure it in terms of physical output?

00:22.326 --> 00:25.009
Well, by the time my secretary types it, she's got it on the old computer.

00:25.208 --> 00:28.091
She can tell me, you know, how many I've done.

00:28.411 --> 00:30.674
I know roughly, you know, how many I've done.

00:30.714 --> 00:32.155
So do you write by longhand?

00:32.396 --> 00:39.243
I write hardly by longhand, but also I've got a very old, um, portable typewriter.

00:39.823 --> 00:39.964
Uh-huh.

00:39.984 --> 00:42.867
It's electric, um, and I love it.

00:42.887 --> 00:46.370
I can't cope with things with, I'm afraid, with a lot of technology.

00:46.390 --> 00:50.975
And, um, I just wonder what I should do when it finally, you know, gives up, because I like that.

00:51.576 --> 00:52.617
I don't want, I don't want

00:53.035 --> 00:54.558
I don't want it very much on the screen.

00:54.758 --> 01:00.027
It's awfully difficult when you get used to these things, but of course she does it on the work process when it goes on the screen.

01:00.047 --> 01:05.115
I mean, last of all, it goes on to somebody who professionally puts it on the disc.

01:05.135 --> 01:06.217
So that's fine.

01:06.237 --> 01:10.544
But I love writing by hand, and, you know, I will dash away on this.

01:10.564 --> 01:12.107
And then I dictate it on the tape.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.342
You dictate your writing?

01:14.723 --> 01:17.506
Yes, but I do it first, and then I dictate it onto tape.

01:17.887 --> 01:22.973
I find that very hard to believe, because the writing is so clean and so smooth.

01:23.334 --> 01:27.980
Your writing is so clean and so smooth, and it surprises me that you're able to do that.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.823
But I don't do the original dictating.

01:30.843 --> 01:34.168
I write it by hand, or I type it.

01:34.208 --> 01:40.035
Now, my writing is so bad and so poor, especially when I'm trying to go fast, that I couldn't give it to anybody to type.

01:40.175 --> 01:41.537
I could hardly read it myself.

01:41.922 --> 01:46.430
So when I've done it, I will then dictate it from that onto text while I can still read it.

01:46.871 --> 01:49.336
And then my secretary will type it back.

01:49.596 --> 01:51.239
And then that's the first draft, in a way.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.263
And then I'll amend that.

01:53.703 --> 01:56.028
How carefully do you plot these stories?

01:56.969 --> 01:57.430
Oh, very.

01:57.450 --> 01:57.571
Very.

01:58.031 --> 01:58.412
Yes.

01:58.645 --> 01:59.366
Yes.

01:59.386 --> 02:07.818
What's interesting, of course, is that however carefully I plot it, and I do plot it in huge detail, the book always alters during the writing.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.921
Well, you find that with your work, don't you?

02:10.061 --> 02:12.304
I mean, you may know, you think that's going to go.

02:12.344 --> 02:17.952
And it's wonderful, because sometimes, you know, one gets these wonderful excitements.

02:17.973 --> 02:21.217
Well, you as a writer will know that, you know, something you never thought of yourself.

02:21.237 --> 02:23.961
Ideas, inspirations, ways that change things.

02:24.262 --> 02:28.388
that you haven't planned, that just occurred during the actual writing of the book.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.532
It's so funny, because I write nonfiction.

02:30.852 --> 02:34.418
So I have to turn in, I have to submit a proposal for my book.

02:35.099 --> 02:40.127
And what's so amusing is I've gone back and read the proposal for my book, which was 638 pages.

02:40.988 --> 02:44.033
And it's amazing, the best chapters in that book weren't even in a proposal.

02:44.073 --> 02:51.805
And the book I'm working on now, the things that I'm so enthused about, and so engaged in it.

02:52.207 --> 02:53.833
weren't in the proposal at all.

02:53.893 --> 02:56.683
I've gone up on tangents that I never expected.

02:56.723 --> 02:58.208
I can absolutely understand that.

02:58.449 --> 03:01.018
And things that I thought were really going to be important,

03:01.387 --> 03:03.551
are boring me now.

03:03.591 --> 03:07.739
Because the more I learn about it, I say, this is really not so interesting.

03:07.759 --> 03:08.881
But this is fascinating.

03:08.961 --> 03:09.723
Yes, yes.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.566
Absolutely.

03:11.907 --> 03:14.291
And you can wake up in the morning and think, ah, there's an idea.

03:14.311 --> 03:16.175
And the more you pursue it, the more fascinating it becomes.

03:16.596 --> 03:21.505
So you throw something overboard because this new road that you're going down is so fascinating.

03:21.525 --> 03:22.066
Absolutely.

03:22.086 --> 03:23.749
So that happens.

03:23.932 --> 03:28.760
You know, the control, to an extent, is still there, has to be, because it's such a structured form.

03:29.721 --> 03:31.604
Such a structured form, yes.

03:32.586 --> 03:43.122
A detective story is, I mean, not going to change, for example, the identity of the victim or the identity of the killer, but nevertheless, ideas come during the writing.

03:43.507 --> 03:45.689
And the book does change.

03:45.829 --> 03:48.151
I never quite get the book I thought I was going to write.

03:48.392 --> 03:50.954
And you don't get the book you thought you were going to write, do you?

03:50.974 --> 03:51.414
Not at all.

03:51.575 --> 03:52.656
That's what's so interesting.

03:52.676 --> 03:55.178
In fact, I'm in the process now of changing my subtitle.

03:55.258 --> 04:00.963
I think the title stays the same, but I like to basically summarize my book in my subtitle.

04:00.983 --> 04:04.807
And I'm changing it now because it's taking a different perspective.

04:04.927 --> 04:12.214
But I have to say with this book, because without giving anything away at all, because I'm pretty good at figuring out who done it.

04:12.413 --> 04:14.275
And you got me here.

04:15.536 --> 04:17.258
I thought I had it three times.

04:17.438 --> 04:18.659
I said, I've got it now.

04:18.679 --> 04:20.722
This is easy.

04:20.742 --> 04:21.562
It's not easy.

04:21.582 --> 04:23.144
She's got another trick up her sleeve.

04:23.965 --> 04:29.471
And that's why I'm actually applauding.

04:29.491 --> 04:32.974
I mean, do you have these various layers of responsibility?

04:33.054 --> 04:35.257
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.519
A culpability, I guess, is probably the word.

04:37.539 --> 04:38.640
Yes.

04:39.110 --> 04:42.593
Writing, of course, are also layers of motivation.

04:44.555 --> 04:58.587
You're going to have your suspect that you could have done it, and then you have to have a situation in which your reader can reason out, yes, I think she is guilty, but on the other hand, how could she be there, or, you know, that's not possible, and so forth.

04:58.607 --> 05:01.189
I'm not sure how many people read in that way, of course.

05:01.209 --> 05:03.851
I think a lot read just for the story and the characters.

05:04.692 --> 05:07.935
I feel it's very important that the mystery is credible, that there is a mystery.

05:08.219 --> 05:14.166
That's why people who obviously read it, you read it, looking at clues and following the clues.

05:14.186 --> 05:17.450
The game for me is, I want to figure this thing out.

05:17.470 --> 05:19.793
And I know that we've discussed this before.

05:20.313 --> 05:22.356
You believe in abiding by the conventions.

05:22.436 --> 05:23.197
Oh, absolutely.

05:23.217 --> 05:23.797
Yes, I do.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.781
You have to give the reader a fair shot.

05:26.841 --> 05:33.849
I've got to give the reader a fair shot, yes.

05:33.869 --> 05:36.032
And of course you can get the sort of situation when we...

05:37.092 --> 05:49.049
Well, I mean, obviously one doesn't want to gain more people who haven't read it, but sort of rather intriguing clues when you've got the situation of the murderer come in in the morning with his Macintosh over his arm.

05:49.069 --> 05:52.073
The feeling is that he's conceding something, he's bringing something in.

05:52.373 --> 05:55.498
But of course what he was conceding was the fact that he wasn't bringing something in.

05:55.538 --> 06:02.087
He wasn't conceding the presence of something, he was conceding the absence of something, the absence of his briefcase.

06:02.219 --> 06:10.047
I was pondering that as I went along, and then I said, no, no, but I hadn't realized that it was the absence of these things.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.789
Yes, yes.

06:12.149 --> 06:12.850
Do you do a chart?

06:12.870 --> 06:13.590
Do you chart these things?

06:13.731 --> 06:14.411
I do.

06:14.451 --> 06:15.092
Yes, I do.

06:15.112 --> 06:18.315
I have a chart where everybody is at the relevant time.

06:18.335 --> 06:20.017
Timing is always a great problem with me.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.341
The timeline is exactly where everybody is.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.724
Timing, timing, absolutely.

06:26.824 --> 06:28.205
What can people do in the time?

06:28.245 --> 06:28.986
Where were they?

06:29.270 --> 06:35.879
And, of course, the complication is where they were, an actual fact in your book, and where, of course, they told the police they were.

06:37.362 --> 06:42.589
Yes, but it's interesting how the new clues come as you write.

06:44.031 --> 06:44.412
I don't know.

06:44.972 --> 06:45.413
But they do.

06:46.174 --> 06:46.495
They do.

06:47.456 --> 06:48.978
They're fascinating to write.

06:48.998 --> 06:50.480
Detective stories are fascinating to write.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.203
That's why I love writing.

06:52.223 --> 06:58.011
We all know about your background earlier and how you became interested in forensics and things like that.

06:58.261 --> 07:04.089
But I still have the sense there are a lot of sophisticated things here that you had to do a lot of research.

07:04.169 --> 07:04.950
A lot.

07:05.110 --> 07:05.651
Absolutely.

07:05.671 --> 07:06.752
A great deal of research.

07:07.233 --> 07:18.208
I mean, I was fascinated to begin with the contrast between the order and the dignity and hierarchy and tradition of the criminal law.

07:18.228 --> 07:23.475
In fact, all the law, but I was thinking, of course, of the criminal law, and the great courtesy with which

07:23.675 --> 07:41.019
you know, a criminal trial is conducted, and the appalling events which give rise to them, between, you know, the matters which the lawyers deal with, and these wonderful chambers, of course, in the Middle Temple, and the, you know, Inner Temple's where Lincoln's in.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.423
Could the American audience explain what chambers are?

07:44.443 --> 07:45.625
That's law office, right?

07:45.685 --> 07:46.386
Is that what it means?

07:46.406 --> 07:48.028
Yeah, the chambers of the offices.

07:48.295 --> 07:50.898
How it's organized is a very, very odd system.

07:50.918 --> 07:56.584
I mean, I think I ought to, in talking to this, explain to Americans that we have two kinds of lawyers.

07:57.045 --> 07:58.967
It's not very rational, it's grown up like that.

07:59.428 --> 08:02.071
We have lawyers who are called solicitors.

08:02.391 --> 08:05.114
They do practically every business in law.

08:05.134 --> 08:10.500
But then we have barristers, and it's barristers who appear in the high court before the judge or the jury.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.042
And it's the barristers who wear the wigs.

08:12.376 --> 08:25.776
The barristers take special training, apart from their law degrees, and they are required to join one of the inns of court, which are medieval inns of court, and eat their dinners in these great halls.

08:26.177 --> 08:35.852
And then they are called to the bar, go before the Lord Chancellor, dressed in astonishing... So this is when you make the transition from solicitor to barrister, when you call to the silk.

08:35.872 --> 08:36.753
Now, a silk.

08:37.194 --> 08:37.935
A silk, yes.

08:38.135 --> 08:39.497
You wouldn't necessarily...

08:39.477 --> 08:45.702
But you wouldn't necessarily make a transition from solicitor to barrister.

08:45.722 --> 08:48.685
An awful lot of lawyers don't aspire or want to be barristers.

08:48.705 --> 08:49.566
They want to be solicitors.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.668
Solicitors would deal with all the everyday legal business.

08:52.749 --> 08:56.172
And also things like conveyances and agreements and deeds.

08:57.353 --> 09:00.836
You know, they have a different kind of training, exactly.

09:00.916 --> 09:01.456
Contracts.

09:01.476 --> 09:02.377
Yes, exactly.

09:02.397 --> 09:05.219
And the work for the barristers comes through the solicitors.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.202
In other words, you know, if somebody

09:09.093 --> 09:15.384
malign me, if somebody libeled me, I don't go straight to a barrister, I can't.

09:15.685 --> 09:27.085
I go to my solicitor, and he says, well, we can take a counter's opinion, we can take a barrister's opinion, and if I go to court, a barrister, not my solicitor, probably, well... A comparable comparison might be...

09:27.503 --> 09:30.950
You go to a general practitioner, a doctor, to see how you're feeling.

09:31.070 --> 09:31.992
Absolutely right.

09:32.012 --> 09:36.181
And if there's a specific problem, he will send you to a specialist.

09:36.221 --> 09:37.584
You're absolutely right.

09:37.604 --> 09:39.628
That's a very, very good analogy.

09:39.728 --> 09:43.015
And it's also a good analogy in that

09:42.995 --> 09:47.381
people who are general practitioners are not seeing themselves as being on their way to being specialists.

09:47.401 --> 09:52.749
If they're in hospital, they may be seeing their way to qualify to become parents and all kinds of surgeons or physicians.

09:52.769 --> 09:57.496
But the general practitioners, general practitioners, because that's the kind of medicine he wants to do, and that's the kind of medicine he does.

09:57.616 --> 10:00.400
And he's looking for symptoms and things like that.

10:00.541 --> 10:03.385
And then when he's in over his head, he sends you off to his specialist.

10:03.405 --> 10:03.825
Absolutely.

10:04.246 --> 10:04.987
So that is it.

10:05.007 --> 10:09.153
So the ones who appear before the judges are the barristers.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.837
And when a barrister is senior,

10:13.167 --> 10:22.975
and very well thought of within the law, then you can be made what's called a queen's council, or if we had a king, it would be a king's council, a QC.

10:25.357 --> 10:32.043
One of Her Majesty's councils learned in the law, which has some great things, and they go before the Lord Chancellor and make QCs.

10:32.504 --> 10:34.165
And those are the senior barristers.

10:34.185 --> 10:35.766
You pay far more if you want a QC.

10:36.187 --> 10:40.430
And of course, a QC, it's like all these people.

10:40.871 --> 10:42.432
You've got strong trade unions, really.

10:42.698 --> 10:47.887
If you want a QC to represent you in court, you want to pay in court without what's called a junior, an ordinary person.

10:48.468 --> 10:50.892
So you pay an awful lot for QC, pay double fees.

10:51.232 --> 10:59.727
And QC is especially not in criminal law, but in the other law, other kinds of law to do with divorce, libel, commercial law, international law.

10:59.887 --> 11:00.488
Civil law.

11:00.588 --> 11:02.732
Fantastic thing.

11:03.016 --> 11:07.261
Fantastic things.

11:07.281 --> 11:12.749
Which is why the top position in this particular chamber was the most public.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.072
Well, yes.

11:15.092 --> 11:23.222
The thing is, it's so complex really because... Anyway, those are the barrister's and those are the senior barrister's so-called accusers.

11:23.242 --> 11:28.669
Now, the longest-serving barrister's officers are called chambers.

11:28.852 --> 11:33.319
And they have an arrangement by which they are tenants of chambers.

11:33.439 --> 11:35.222
In other words, you get chambers.

11:35.522 --> 11:41.031
They don't operate as chambers, as one set of chambers within chambers.

11:41.171 --> 11:42.953
They are tenants of that chamber.

11:43.374 --> 11:46.259
And they, therefore, are independent practitioners.

11:46.279 --> 11:51.647
If you and I were barristers and we were in the same chamber, you could be on one side and I could be on the other in the same case.

11:51.667 --> 11:51.827
Really?

11:51.847 --> 11:53.209
Oh, see, that would never happen here.

11:53.229 --> 11:53.830
Well, it would never happen.

11:53.810 --> 11:54.711
Absolutely.

11:54.771 --> 11:59.418
In fact, the firm, what we call a law firm, would say, we can't handle this as a conflict.

11:59.438 --> 11:59.838
No, no.

11:59.858 --> 12:00.860
You get, oh yes.

12:00.940 --> 12:02.963
Well, you get that with solicitors.

12:03.564 --> 12:06.127
You never have, if you're buying a house, you don't have the same solicitors.

12:06.468 --> 12:08.310
You'll disagree, we don't have the same solicitors.

12:08.330 --> 12:15.480
But once you get, you certainly wouldn't both use the same banister, but your banister, opposing banister, may well be part of chamber, the same chamber.

12:15.661 --> 12:17.684
Because they're independent practitioners.

12:18.445 --> 12:21.229
But the most senior one is the head of chambers.

12:21.469 --> 12:23.732
And most judges would have been head of chambers.

12:24.185 --> 12:32.276
And people talk about being in Lord Lester's chambers, or Mr. Monckton's chambers, or Mr. Alastair's chambers, and that's the head of chambers.

12:32.997 --> 12:36.202
Let's talk a little bit about... I took an awful lot of research.

12:36.282 --> 12:40.388
I knew that, but there were lots of minutiae that I did.

12:40.889 --> 12:51.784
But the research, just in terms of investigative stuff, and pathology, and the DNA testing that you mentioned here, I believe you mentioned... I mean, this is all new stuff.

12:51.844 --> 12:52.605
This stuff, isn't it?

12:52.822 --> 12:55.887
DNA is made a huge difference, of course.

12:55.907 --> 12:56.267
Of course.

12:56.728 --> 13:06.303
We just had a case here in Boston overnight, a horrible, heartbreaking story of a young girl who disappeared 12 years ago when she was 9 years old, walking.

13:06.323 --> 13:07.785
And it was a terrible story.

13:07.805 --> 13:13.193
And then they found a bone fragment, a skull fragment, just a couple weeks ago.

13:13.460 --> 13:20.408
in the woods, and just this morning they announced that DNA testing confirms that that fragment is the girl's.

13:20.568 --> 13:24.292
Just having found one piece of a bone... It's made such a difference.

13:24.312 --> 13:28.997
It's made a difference to forensic work, and because it's made a difference to crime writing.

13:29.017 --> 13:42.032
I mean, any crime writer, for example, any crime writer who had a situation in which there were blood stains or body stains, and didn't make it plain that, given that, the police would

13:42.670 --> 13:46.734
you know, get a DNA profile and be able to go around testing people.

13:46.754 --> 13:51.899
You know, I mean, the ordinary public know about these things now, don't they?

13:51.919 --> 13:53.460
I mean, DNA is quite astonishing.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.505
It is, and they're very sophisticated on, you know, how telling the evidence is.

13:58.565 --> 13:59.045
Oh, yeah.

13:59.065 --> 14:01.307
In the Simpson case, everybody knew that he did it.

14:01.668 --> 14:02.188
I know.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.690
How could anybody be on their jury and look at that evidence?

14:05.091 --> 14:05.371
I know.

14:06.332 --> 14:08.614
But there were other factors that went into that.

14:08.874 --> 14:09.775
But I think that...

14:10.160 --> 14:13.164
The reason this man is a pariah now is because it was so obvious.

14:13.184 --> 14:14.366
The evidence was so overwhelming.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.028
I'm glad he is a pariah.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.191
And I'm glad they took that civil case.

14:18.532 --> 14:27.244
And which really proved... I mean, of course, I can see... I mean, it seemed to me... I can see the whole world of grossness kind of justice.

14:27.264 --> 14:28.946
But one can see what happened.

14:29.186 --> 14:33.733
A, it seemed to me that the prosecution was less able than it should be.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.475
But B, against that...

14:35.810 --> 14:41.979
I mean, if I'd been a black jury woman, would I want to go back to my black neighborhood having convicted?

14:42.019 --> 14:43.060
They weren't going to do it.

14:43.081 --> 14:46.926
They hadn't even got the sense to stay out a day or two and pretend they were considering it, hadn't they?

14:47.006 --> 14:48.929
They were there for months, a million hours.

14:48.949 --> 14:53.395
That's why you go back and remember the judge coming in and saying, I'm going to have a mutiny on my hand.

14:53.415 --> 14:55.258
These jurors want this thing to end.

14:55.318 --> 14:57.021
The reason is they'd already made up their minds.

14:57.782 --> 14:59.304
They didn't need a nine-month trial.

14:59.384 --> 15:00.986
They already knew how they were going to vote.

15:01.006 --> 15:02.288
They already made that decision.

15:02.308 --> 15:03.790
And they didn't even consider the evidence.

15:04.071 --> 15:04.872
That was horrible.

15:05.088 --> 15:09.094
But anyway, I hate to get going on with J. Simpson.

15:09.314 --> 15:13.840
But I have to say, I have a sense that this novel was a particular challenge for you.

15:13.860 --> 15:17.265
Because structurally, you tell us in the first sentence who the victim is.

15:17.966 --> 15:24.155
And then even, you know, I have to say, she generates, some of the reviewers say, a detestable character.

15:24.175 --> 15:24.836
I don't think so.

15:25.256 --> 15:26.037
I respected her.

15:26.057 --> 15:27.119
I liked her.

15:27.379 --> 15:29.803
I said, I like this woman.

15:29.843 --> 15:31.365
What's wrong with this woman?

15:31.405 --> 15:32.226
You offended me.

15:32.459 --> 15:34.201
I mean, she is difficult.

15:34.442 --> 15:35.383
She is in many ways.

15:35.403 --> 15:35.944
I'm happy.

15:35.964 --> 15:36.524
She's an achiever.

15:36.544 --> 15:37.165
She's an achiever.

15:37.245 --> 15:39.288
I can't see why people say she's so despicable.

15:39.549 --> 15:40.189
I don't see that at all.

15:40.209 --> 15:41.912
What does she do that's despicable?

15:41.932 --> 15:49.302
And also, because what is so important to me as a woman is to show why she was as she was, how she became what she was.

15:49.802 --> 15:52.466
I mean, she's the only child of a sadistic schoolmaster.

15:53.027 --> 15:54.028
You're not going to like men.

15:54.228 --> 16:07.109
She's fighting her way up in a very male world, and of course as one of those world, as a colleague said too, as far as her daughter was concerned, she would have been a very good mother of a brilliant, ambitious and beautiful daughter, but that wasn't the kind she got.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.853
The daughter was not very loving.

16:09.873 --> 16:13.519
She wasn't loving to the daughter, the daughter wasn't loving to her, that was a disaster.

16:13.853 --> 16:16.936
Do you see what's become of Octavia, by the way?

16:17.116 --> 16:18.578
In your mind.

16:18.838 --> 16:21.140
And these are some questions I want to get to.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.662
The things that you don't tell the reader.

16:23.022 --> 16:29.749
I want to discuss that about Commander d'Alglige, too, because I'd like to know what you know about him that you never tell us.

16:30.229 --> 16:33.693
Things that you, as the creator, have to know about him.

16:34.033 --> 16:41.201
There must be so many things about him that you know that you never tell the reader, but it's important that you know things about him.

16:41.241 --> 16:42.662
Maybe that's not the case.

16:43.047 --> 16:47.934
And I'm not asking you to give me a biography of it here, but I guess maybe we should respond to that.

16:48.114 --> 16:50.657
I think to an extent that's certainly true.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.221
I've left that, of course, over the years of the books.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.365
I've told an awful lot about him.

16:56.385 --> 17:05.658
I mean, I think it was quite a lot about his childhood and the rectory and all sorts of things from his childhood come up at odd times, don't they?

17:05.678 --> 17:05.998
They do.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.204
We don't know much about his current love life that's shrouded in difficulty.

17:10.224 --> 17:12.447
It's difficult to think he's actually living as a celibate.

17:12.646 --> 17:17.524
I don't think he is, but that's sort of his business at the moment.

17:17.544 --> 17:18.929
You don't think he is?

17:19.050 --> 17:21.238
I doubt it very much.

17:21.573 --> 17:26.420
I must say, I do occasionally feel I ought to get that man married.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.022
I think he should.

17:28.503 --> 17:38.596
But, uh, Kate, and I love the relationship with Kate, because... Yes, I think he's very, very fond of Kate, and she's a little in love with him, there's no doubt that that.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.459
I think he's always sir to her.

17:40.479 --> 17:41.380
Oh, yes, always sir.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.445
And there is this professional... Oh, yes, absolutely there.

17:44.945 --> 17:49.892
And I thought it was sort of interesting in this book, for the first time, Kate, from her back then...

17:50.260 --> 18:04.506
is beginning to feel slightly different than Ronda's, because she feels where these two men are concerned, Daryl Gleesha Pierce, that there's an attitude to the job, kind of masculine comradeship somehow, from which she's subtly excluded.

18:04.526 --> 18:06.690
Now she isn't, because Daryl Gleesha doesn't operate like that.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.573
But she's the better shot, isn't she?

18:08.772 --> 18:10.274
She's a better shot.

18:11.135 --> 18:14.020
Why didn't you let me shoot?

18:14.400 --> 18:19.267
I will bet that's the kind of thing that came to you in the process of writing the book.

18:19.808 --> 18:20.228
That's right.

18:20.589 --> 18:26.157
And also in the process of the last scene when she's in

18:26.542 --> 18:41.901
in the hospital and that came to me during the writing of the book that Kate could have been actually brought up in that same book of facts because I wanted to emphasize you know we don't know what makes a psychopath here you have two people with massive upbringing really

18:42.151 --> 18:48.938
loveless and deprived, and one becomes an ambitious, successful policewoman, and the other becomes a psychopath.

18:48.958 --> 18:49.158
Why?

18:49.258 --> 18:50.119
We don't know.

18:50.259 --> 18:50.819
We don't know.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.261
It's a roll of the dice, isn't it?

18:52.301 --> 18:52.761
We don't know.

18:53.682 --> 18:55.564
But that, so that bit came in.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.887
And of course there, we need to talk about what came about Taylor.

18:59.988 --> 19:07.396
There, Kate, who's the kind of woman she is, was sort of more or less saying, you know, finish your education, get a life, I had a career, you know, you've got health, you've got money.

19:07.656 --> 19:12.040
I mean, she even said, Dr. October said that Ash hadn't got

19:12.863 --> 19:13.384
a chance.

19:14.485 --> 19:21.174
Kate says, you know, he has intelligence, he has strength, you know.

19:21.214 --> 19:23.017
He has a chance.

19:23.037 --> 19:29.626
None of this will get into the piece, by the way, because this really gets too deep into the story, and it does kind of give some of it away.

19:29.646 --> 19:33.471
Although we certainly know that Ash is involved to some degree, but...

19:34.008 --> 19:36.770
There's Octavia saying, I know he wouldn't cut my throat.

19:36.790 --> 19:40.354
She says, Octavia, he did catch your throat.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.095
He never, exactly.

19:42.175 --> 19:44.738
And also, you see, I think that's exactly what he's doing.

19:44.758 --> 19:46.179
God, I wonder what he was doing.

19:46.699 --> 19:49.021
And also, when he made the fire.

19:49.782 --> 19:51.884
I love that.

19:51.984 --> 19:58.710
Kate is so, and when Ash liked the fire, liked that bit solidly, sort of putting that fire together so carefully.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.412
And of course, she thinks, you know, he felt pity for me.

20:01.432 --> 20:02.153
He knew I was cold.

20:02.173 --> 20:03.154
He wanted to warm me.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.571
And Kate knows that he was deliberately setting up a signal.

20:06.691 --> 20:07.612
Because he knew it was over.

20:07.692 --> 20:10.436
He knew it was over, and he was going to go out and take the girl with him.

20:10.456 --> 20:13.000
That's right.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.081
Once he killed that guy.

20:14.722 --> 20:14.923
Yeah.

20:15.183 --> 20:16.345
The guy that came up on the bike.

20:16.645 --> 20:20.951
The only guy for whom he'd really felt any affection, actually.

20:20.971 --> 20:21.292
Yeah.

20:21.412 --> 20:22.093
That's interesting.

20:22.393 --> 20:24.196
And that's one of these untold little stories.

20:24.216 --> 20:25.097
It's one of those untold stories.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.621
That's one of those little v-nets that kind of comes in and really leave us.

20:27.641 --> 20:27.861
Yes.

20:28.282 --> 20:29.884
One of the...

20:30.370 --> 20:31.572
lawyers that I spoke to.

20:32.152 --> 20:34.515
He was concerned with mental health cases.

20:37.019 --> 20:42.305
I suppose with people appealing against detention of the mental health acts and things of that sort.

20:42.425 --> 20:45.009
And there were a lot of psychopaths.

20:45.029 --> 20:55.382
And he said, now, with Ash, if he had married Octavia, do you think love would have changed him, her love would have changed him?

20:55.700 --> 20:56.521
And I said, no.

20:56.982 --> 20:59.486
And he said, no, that's right, it wouldn't.

20:59.706 --> 21:01.169
A psychopath is a psychopath.

21:01.189 --> 21:02.952
A psychopath is a psychopath.

21:03.092 --> 21:09.362
And what he would have done is, there's a wonderful phrase that was used for a book called a decent interval.

21:09.382 --> 21:14.550
The decent interval between the time the Vietnam War ended and when the North Vietnamese came down and took over.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.033
They gave a decent interval of two years.

21:16.473 --> 21:19.378
He would have given a decent interval from the time he married her to...

21:19.561 --> 21:26.772
until the time he got all of the wealth squared away, all the ducks lined up, as we say, and then he would have killed her.

21:26.792 --> 21:27.954
Yes, he would have done it.

21:27.974 --> 21:31.579
And without anything, because that's what a psychopath does.

21:31.699 --> 21:39.311
But I want to talk about, I almost feel that this is really a demonstration of such tremendous confidence in your part as a writer.

21:39.892 --> 21:42.175
To start right away, we know totally who the victim is.

21:42.716 --> 21:46.281
You give us half a dozen suspects.

21:46.602 --> 21:46.682
Yes.

21:47.033 --> 21:48.034
one after the other.

21:48.495 --> 21:48.975
Here they are.

21:48.995 --> 21:49.636
Take your pick.

21:50.077 --> 21:51.378
Absolutely.

21:51.398 --> 21:52.840
You tell me which one it was.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.783
It's almost like a challenge, isn't it?

21:54.803 --> 21:55.203
Yes, it is.

21:55.263 --> 21:57.286
Is it throwing down a gun?

21:57.306 --> 21:59.348
Yes, I suppose it is like that in a way.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.873
I'm not sure I thought of it quite in those terms when I was doing it.

22:03.353 --> 22:06.016
I felt, you know, here I've got my victim.

22:06.036 --> 22:07.638
This is what made the sort of woman she was.

22:07.739 --> 22:09.200
These are the members of James.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.123
These are the circles that she lives.

22:12.144 --> 22:16.990
Friends, lover, colleagues, and

22:17.577 --> 22:21.185
Each of them, really, has some reason to dislike or fear her from here.

22:21.505 --> 22:22.387
I'm telling you who they are.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.692
I'm telling you why they dislike or fear her.

22:24.712 --> 22:26.195
So really, in a sense, you're right.

22:26.235 --> 22:27.017
They are lined up.

22:27.498 --> 22:30.264
And the reason is one of them is going to kill her.

22:30.524 --> 22:31.827
One of them is going to kill her.

22:31.847 --> 22:35.655
Well, this is not for the piece, but actually two of them.

22:35.675 --> 22:38.100
Well, actually three of them might very well have killed her.

22:38.452 --> 22:40.874
Certainly the woman, the housekeeper.

22:40.894 --> 22:41.555
Yes, absolutely.

22:41.575 --> 22:43.577
She was definitely there to do something.

22:43.597 --> 22:44.338
Absolutely.

22:44.498 --> 22:45.359
She wasn't there to kill her.

22:45.399 --> 22:50.343
She was there to humiliate her, to make her feel her own pain.

22:50.463 --> 22:51.184
She was, yes.

22:51.304 --> 23:07.800
I think the thing is that... You don't think she sees homicide in her... No, but this is one of the few books I think I've written, and only one other one, in which at the end we don't get an arrest, because what?

23:08.135 --> 23:14.938
The other people quipped on it.

23:15.374 --> 23:16.215
They could.

23:16.235 --> 23:17.376
The woman could have done it.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.157
The woman is dead.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.759
I think he says that.

23:19.779 --> 23:20.300
Ash could have done it.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.503
Well, Ash is extremely unlikely to think of.

23:22.523 --> 23:23.965
Ash could have got into the temple.

23:24.005 --> 23:25.326
But nevertheless, Ash is dead.

23:25.747 --> 23:27.229
And Ash is known to be a murderer.

23:27.409 --> 23:33.156
And if the case had come to court, the defense would have said, well, look.

23:33.556 --> 23:34.578
How can you see?

23:34.978 --> 23:37.942
So this is a case in which we know who did it.

23:37.962 --> 23:39.323
We know who did it.

23:39.343 --> 23:40.685
It's never going to come to court.

23:40.705 --> 23:41.045
That's right.

23:41.065 --> 23:44.790
So that's why he has to go in on that final scene and tell the man, look,

23:45.040 --> 23:45.381
I know.

23:45.581 --> 23:49.230
I can't solve this case, but I know you did.

23:49.410 --> 23:50.913
And then the man says he likes that.

23:50.953 --> 24:00.395
He says, well, let's say, this is a fictional thing, of course, but let's just say he knows where he's standing, but he wants to tell Gleeson to have the satisfaction of knowing.

24:00.856 --> 24:01.758
He does.

24:01.778 --> 24:02.540
He does.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.522
And he knows he's safe.

24:03.839 --> 24:10.468
Because even if Douglas arrested him, he would say, I was putting forward a hypothesis, showing how I could have done it.

24:10.568 --> 24:14.674
And I, if you want to, can put forward a hypothesis to show how Mrs. Carpenter could have done it.

24:14.694 --> 24:17.999
And Mrs. Carpenter is dead.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.663
Mrs. Carpenter could have stabbed and then put the blood on.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.830
You do work within the conventions of a genre.

24:26.907 --> 24:34.657
But I think one of the things, one of the qualities of critics like myself, these are novels.

24:34.677 --> 24:35.338
I hope so.

24:35.678 --> 24:37.541
That's what I'm talking about.

24:38.182 --> 24:47.294
That's why I say you do kind of, you abide by the conventions on the one hand, but on the other hand you say, I want to do something a little different here.

24:47.314 --> 24:48.455
Here's our victim straight away.

24:48.475 --> 24:49.677
You're going to like this victim.

24:49.797 --> 24:50.498
I like her.

24:50.558 --> 24:52.881
This is not a totally despicable person.

24:53.114 --> 24:56.999
Where these people are coming up with that, I never know.

24:57.539 --> 25:04.548
And I have to tell you, I really injected some of these notes, by the way, because I do think they almost tell you too much.

25:05.189 --> 25:07.992
They take away a little bit of the stuff.

25:10.495 --> 25:13.219
I don't know.

25:13.239 --> 25:14.700
I like to be totally surprised.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.565
I never read these things, I have to say, anyway.

25:19.169 --> 25:24.997
I'm trying to sort of, I suppose, stretch the conventions, trying to work within them, turn them around, twist them.

25:25.698 --> 25:34.269
See, I know the detective story is an artificial form of writing, but all novels are artificial forms of writing.

25:34.309 --> 25:46.346
In every single novel, the writer is using the stuff of his imagination, his compulsions, to put them in an orderly and compelling form, isn't it?

25:46.366 --> 25:48.889
It is an artificial form.

25:49.088 --> 25:50.510
Well, of course it is.

25:50.550 --> 25:56.696
Another very interesting thing, which I'm going to say it now so I can have it on the tape.

25:56.736 --> 26:05.245
We know more about this woman, the victim, in death through your presentation of the various suspects.

26:06.026 --> 26:11.152
What we learn about their relationship with her almost illumines her life more.

26:11.192 --> 26:14.455
It fleshes out another aspect of her life in death.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.106
much more than we ever knew.

26:17.146 --> 26:20.611
Yes, well, you're a very perceptive reader, of course.

26:21.212 --> 26:29.863
I think why you get sort of really irritated by some people's reactions is that not everybody reads novels with a kind of perception you'll read them with.

26:29.883 --> 26:35.110
They read them with the far more goodies and the baddies, and I don't know, but he's good and he's bad and so on.

26:35.478 --> 26:38.783
But this is true, and their reactions to her after she's dead.

26:39.644 --> 26:45.192
And the way in which, and it's rather sad, she has seen always a delvish when he asks, what was she like, trying to find what she's like.

26:45.392 --> 26:47.495
He always gets to say she was a very fine lawyer.

26:49.618 --> 26:54.585
She wasn't sort of seen to me, she wasn't sort of seen in any other terms, very by many of her colleagues.

26:54.625 --> 26:58.891
And then they say, well, that's what she would have liked to be remembered by, because that was the most important thing about her.

26:58.931 --> 27:03.298
It was very important, of course, to several of these people that you die without pain.

27:03.798 --> 27:04.219
Yes.

27:04.604 --> 27:06.206
Yes, it was, yes.

27:06.226 --> 27:07.287
And who asked that question?

27:07.307 --> 27:08.088
It was very interesting.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.491
The woman who put the... Yes, yes.

27:10.611 --> 27:11.913
Who put the words on her hand.

27:11.933 --> 27:12.113
Yes, yes.

27:12.153 --> 27:14.195
Who didn't know, of course, at that time that she'd been murdered.

27:14.215 --> 27:18.120
And that's why... That was very clever of you, because that took her out of my cast of suspects.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.081
Well, very rightly.

27:19.482 --> 27:20.523
You see, very rightly.

27:20.543 --> 27:21.244
Because she didn't know.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.086
No, she didn't know, very rightly.

27:23.106 --> 27:30.595
And from the point of view, actually, of the construction of the novel and the research, that was quite tricky, because I had to find a way of killing her.

27:31.047 --> 27:35.374
which would mean that she could be there just sitting, as if she'd had a heart attack.

27:36.156 --> 27:47.875
I was going to have a stomp in the throat, you see, and there's lots of notes of things in which people say, no, no, and my medical thing said, no, no, you couldn't get that around bleeding, or very unlikely, you'd have to be stabbed somewhere from the back, which might be wrong.

27:47.855 --> 27:56.311
So you had to talk to... You had to... You, Phyllis Dames, had to talk to professionals and say, where can I stab her so there will be very little blood?

27:56.331 --> 27:58.535
She'll be innocent to use that, but really very little blood.

27:58.555 --> 28:01.621
And then say, well, it really would have to be stabbed apart.

28:01.641 --> 28:04.706
But that would preclude tremendous amounts of blood from coming out?

28:04.846 --> 28:07.191
Well, if it was a very thin thing, it went straight into the heart.

28:07.211 --> 28:09.515
The sort of wound would close up from afterwards.

28:09.535 --> 28:11.078
You might get a little oozing, but you wouldn't get...

28:11.243 --> 28:12.585
The bleeding would all be internal.

28:12.765 --> 28:19.055
So did you have just the mechanics of the murder first, and then you had to fit the technical aspects?

28:19.095 --> 28:22.701
No, I knew that I wanted her to be murdered.

28:24.263 --> 28:31.294
But after that, it had to be, well, if I'm going to have Mrs. Tunder putting the wig on,

28:31.679 --> 28:32.441
finding her dead.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.166
It's got to be that she feels that it's just a heart attack.

28:35.186 --> 28:39.676
And I even meant that me and Mrs. Carpenter's husband, we just told Catherine, he died from a heart attack.

28:39.696 --> 28:42.642
Mrs. Carpenter's not surprised to mind being dead, she assumes his heart attack.

28:43.023 --> 28:45.448
And her reaction is just, my God, she's escaped me.

28:45.648 --> 28:47.111
You know, I wanted a baby.

28:47.131 --> 28:48.154
I didn't get my satisfaction.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.637
I never got my satisfaction.

28:49.997 --> 28:51.741
But she put on the wake of her life.

28:51.761 --> 28:52.202
We had to.

28:52.182 --> 28:55.488
It had to be, the wigs certainly had to put one.

28:55.528 --> 28:57.853
Somebody knew where the wig was, who knew the blood was there.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.798
But that need necessarily be the person who actually put it.

29:00.918 --> 29:04.505
Where did you come up with the idea of the man getting his own blood and putting it in a refrigerator?

29:04.986 --> 29:14.764
Well, I suppose everything you sort of read, casually read, over years,

29:14.744 --> 29:20.837
Somehow it's filed away in the imagination, actually, and some services when it's wanted.

29:21.339 --> 29:31.140
And I have certainly read over the years quite a lot of instances, once AIDS started, of people who had to go into hospitals for operations.

29:31.240 --> 29:31.521
Of course.

29:31.720 --> 29:35.350
And it's quite the thing, you know, you take in your own blood.

29:35.811 --> 29:38.959
I mean, you give the blood over a period of time.

29:38.979 --> 29:40.784
And then you know the blood you're getting.

29:40.864 --> 29:41.386
A is your blood.

29:41.466 --> 29:43.090
So where do you know it's a perfect mix?

29:43.431 --> 29:46.860
B, you know that you're... You see, we have had these people who've been given A.

29:47.245 --> 29:49.728
And nothing more awful.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.249
Can you imagine it?

29:51.409 --> 29:52.471
Can you imagine it more awful?

29:52.971 --> 29:57.696
And this man, you see, I made him a hypocritic, you see.

29:57.716 --> 30:01.380
He's exactly, he's not going in for a very major operation, but he may need to have to have.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.902
And so, right.

30:02.922 --> 30:06.005
And one of the doctors said, well, normally, and I did all the medical research.

30:06.025 --> 30:07.707
I said, well, where would this guy be taken?

30:07.727 --> 30:09.329
I said, normally, at hospital stores there.

30:09.629 --> 30:11.411
I said, he doesn't want it stored at hospital.

30:11.431 --> 30:13.573
He wants to make sure that it's his blood.

30:13.857 --> 30:20.495
So they said, yes, the GP could take it, and an anticoagulant would be put in it, and it would be perfectly all right to store it in the fridge.

30:21.117 --> 30:24.687
And they sent me the pouches, you see, because I... Who are you saying they?

30:24.727 --> 30:25.850
These are medical people?

30:25.870 --> 30:27.073
Yes, the doctor, yes.

30:27.492 --> 30:31.257
It must take a great deal of pleasure in helping you with this.

30:31.537 --> 30:31.998
Oh, they did.

30:32.038 --> 30:32.598
They did.

30:32.618 --> 30:35.562
Tremendous number of people who came to me with detail.

30:35.923 --> 30:38.726
And also, the account of a post-mortem.

30:39.107 --> 30:44.153
That was a post-mortem actually written for me by a chap who does post-mortems on that.

30:44.293 --> 30:49.600
One of the reviewers, let's dispense with this pretty quickly.

30:49.620 --> 30:56.048
One of the reviewers suggests, it might even be the New York Times reviewer, that you may be getting bored with Commander Dalgleish.

30:56.264 --> 31:05.138
Maybe that's why he doesn't come in for 110 pages or so, and that maybe you're preparing for a new generation of detectives, or maybe you're preparing to retire him to the past.

31:05.158 --> 31:06.680
No, not... Did you respond to that?

31:06.881 --> 31:15.975
Well, yes, I think this... You see, people tend to think this because they feel he's not there throughout the book in a very prominent position.

31:15.995 --> 31:19.280
But, of course, he can't be there until the murder takes place.

31:20.342 --> 31:24.448
The television adaptation, of course, he will be, simply because television will trivialise it.

31:24.513 --> 31:33.202
and they'll take the view that everybody's going to see the star at the beginning, and the star somehow or another will be got in at the beginning, however much the book is distorted to do that.

31:33.522 --> 31:43.973
But, I mean, trying to write a really realistic novel, wanting to set up the whole situation, wanting to show the past life of Venetia, none of the priests can be there, so he isn't going to come.

31:43.993 --> 31:49.299
But when he does come, he is there, actually, at all the important parts.

31:49.359 --> 31:50.980
He's there when the body's discovered.

31:51.001 --> 31:53.423
He's the one who goes with his colleagues,

31:53.690 --> 31:58.405
He's the one who interviews most of the prime suspects.

31:58.666 --> 32:04.223
He's the one who goes down and interviews the wife, the ex-wife, ex-husband of Venetia.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.158
and his new wife in the country.

32:06.278 --> 32:09.202
And that gives him the truth.

32:10.003 --> 32:12.125
He goes and has to look at the ocean.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.349
That was a crucial visit.

32:17.131 --> 32:19.935
He is the one who goes to see Mrs. Carpenter.

32:20.816 --> 32:23.399
She's the one that finds that body and investigates that.

32:23.599 --> 32:26.042
He's the one who goes to the church.

32:26.022 --> 32:33.339
Certainly his subordinates go and see the woman who keeps the agency without him.

32:33.359 --> 32:39.272
But on the whole, I don't think there's a major bit of police investigation in that book, but at least she's a person.

32:40.079 --> 32:41.281
the things that he doesn't like.

32:41.361 --> 32:51.856
If things aren't brought to his attention that's going on in some of these other investigations, here's something that they didn't need to tell him about something.

32:51.917 --> 32:58.426
And he said, he said, Pierce, when you get a piece of information like this, I want it immediately.

32:58.967 --> 33:02.713
He's there, I mean, when they get together to review things, you're here, and he's there.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.595
So he's actually wants the investigation.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.278
He's there as much as any of the other people.

33:06.298 --> 33:07.099
He's commanding.

33:07.079 --> 33:08.661
And he's commanding, and he's there.

33:09.162 --> 33:21.717
But if I were, sort of, to spend far more time with him, then I wouldn't have the, what I think is quite interesting relationship between Kate and him, or Kate and Pierce.

33:21.797 --> 33:27.443
And, you know, we wouldn't be able to investigate in as much detail the other characters.

33:27.484 --> 33:28.665
They're just as important to me.

33:29.726 --> 33:33.130
The suspects, for example, are the sort of people they are, their reactions.

33:33.671 --> 33:37.035
Do you, in your mind, know any of his poetry?

33:37.336 --> 33:42.843
Well, I wrote a little bit of it for one of the second books, yes, yes I do.

33:43.304 --> 33:51.255
No, and I wrote two poems for him for the television of Original Sin.

33:51.575 --> 33:56.041
They used the one that was the, I thought, the less good of the two.

33:56.422 --> 33:58.264
I suppose it was the easiest one for them to speak.

33:58.784 --> 34:01.267
But otherwise I haven't put much poetry in.

34:01.327 --> 34:03.771
I think probably I have to put some poetry in.

34:03.851 --> 34:05.933
But I mean, in your mind, you know what kind of a poet he is.

34:05.953 --> 34:08.457
Yes, I know what kind of poet he is, yes.

34:08.477 --> 34:09.859
Oh, he's very good.

34:09.879 --> 34:11.060
Yes, he's a very good poet.

34:11.381 --> 34:22.155
It's interesting, really, actually, because I think when I look at the character that I've created, I wanted him to have a very strong, well, very strong artistic interest.

34:22.235 --> 34:24.758
I just thought that would make him a more complex, interesting human being.

34:24.940 --> 34:28.185
I have a feeling that he would be most likely to be a musician.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.369
I think he's got a musician's mind.

34:31.310 --> 34:35.357
But you see, I don't know enough about music to make that credible.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.319
He obviously wouldn't be a painter.

34:36.359 --> 34:39.283
You can't see him setting up an eagle with an investigation.

34:39.304 --> 34:41.447
But I think he might well have been.

34:41.967 --> 34:45.556
very fond of music and know a lot about music and maybe paid one extra.

34:45.576 --> 34:47.141
He's been around now for about 20 years?

34:47.341 --> 34:49.567
Oh yeah, a very long time, yeah.

34:49.747 --> 34:52.775
Is he ageing in real time?

34:52.795 --> 34:53.758
No, lucky man.

34:53.878 --> 34:58.069
He's a perpetual late middle-aged old middle-aged and the unluckiest creator.

34:58.049 --> 34:59.852
Oh, God, lucky fellow.

34:59.872 --> 35:02.115
He doesn't raise him.

35:02.656 --> 35:04.539
So he's about 50, maybe?

35:05.801 --> 35:06.943
Probably late 40s.

35:06.963 --> 35:07.384
Really?

35:07.664 --> 35:10.328
Yes, at least, late 40s.

35:10.549 --> 35:12.392
Oh, he must be quite a charming man.

35:12.772 --> 35:13.213
Oh, yes, he is.

35:13.233 --> 35:14.475
Quite an interesting person.

35:14.615 --> 35:15.937
Oh, yes, he is.

35:16.178 --> 35:16.658
He's right.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.803
But I couldn't say, I couldn't be so many of them.

35:19.823 --> 35:23.189
But I never kind of put you speaking into the poet, W.H.

35:23.209 --> 35:23.449
Orton.

35:23.885 --> 35:25.067
love detective stories.

35:25.387 --> 35:28.852
And he always had, we had the same publisher, so he always had a new piece.

35:28.872 --> 35:29.893
Who is this now?

35:29.913 --> 35:31.095
W. H. Orton.

35:31.115 --> 35:32.857
Oh, I'm sorry, I missed that, go ahead.

35:32.877 --> 35:34.078
Yeah, he loved detective stories.

35:34.099 --> 35:34.379
He did.

35:34.819 --> 35:40.928
In fact, he wrote a very interesting essay on the classical detective story called Guilty Vicarage.

35:41.248 --> 35:42.009
I'll have to look it up.

35:42.530 --> 35:42.770
Yes, he did.

35:42.790 --> 35:46.976
In which he examined the detective story in relation to Christian theology.

35:46.996 --> 35:51.141
But anyway, so he always got a copy of one of my books that was published, you see.

35:51.340 --> 36:00.604
And we had the, he had a director of flavour and pericolus called Charles Montice.

36:01.687 --> 36:04.033
And Charles said to me, you'll get wisdom.

36:04.385 --> 36:05.927
to write some poetry for Dalgleish.

36:05.967 --> 36:07.168
I thought this was a wonderful idea.

36:07.448 --> 36:09.250
Then, unfortunately, Watson died.

36:09.771 --> 36:10.252
That's a great stylist.

36:10.272 --> 36:11.673
And I was terribly keen about that.

36:11.913 --> 36:14.396
And I was terribly upset that that never happened.

36:14.416 --> 36:16.418
Because, you see, I knew what would happen if it had happened.

36:16.478 --> 36:20.303
And then we should have some reviewers saying, how very unwise of P.D.

36:20.323 --> 36:22.785
James to attempt to write poetry for Dalgleish.

36:22.805 --> 36:23.887
We can no longer believe that.

36:23.907 --> 36:26.950
I should have said, shucks to you, that was dumbed away to all of them.

36:26.970 --> 36:28.211
That would have been so wonderful.

36:28.231 --> 36:29.633
I didn't interview with Doris Lessing.

36:29.613 --> 36:34.562
Because she wrote a few novels under a nom du poom.

36:34.682 --> 36:35.263
Yes, she did.

36:35.343 --> 36:40.853
And the reason was to see what reaction people are going to say.

36:41.294 --> 36:46.643
And she said the one that she liked the most was one woman who said, kind of reads like a young Doris Lessing.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.727
She said, that was the best review.

36:49.108 --> 36:52.093
Because otherwise they're saying, well, this is...

36:52.327 --> 36:54.394
the name of the individual is often.

36:54.434 --> 36:57.906
They're dismissing the author, or they're lionizing the author.

36:58.207 --> 36:59.090
Absolutely.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.257
And I often feel that with prizes like the Book of Priors.

37:01.523 --> 37:05.948
The only way, really, you could judge best novel of the year is if you didn't know who wrote it.

37:05.968 --> 37:07.149
But, of course, you can't do that.

37:07.189 --> 37:08.311
Like a blind wine tasting.

37:08.331 --> 37:10.013
Exactly, a blind wine tasting, because you can't do that.

37:10.033 --> 37:11.034
I know, you can't do that.

37:11.054 --> 37:11.274
Great idea.

37:11.294 --> 37:14.938
But you do go to a novel with a preconception, don't you?

37:14.958 --> 37:19.023
You do have a different view of it if you think it's going to be a Lessing or a Murder.

37:19.043 --> 37:20.705
Or P.D.

37:20.765 --> 37:21.326
James.

37:21.346 --> 37:21.466
P.D.

37:21.486 --> 37:21.886
James.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.588
But if it's something, it's not.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.350
But, you see, I'm not sure.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.293
It was almost totally ignored, wasn't it?

37:27.413 --> 37:29.455
And then, of course, she said, that just shows.

37:29.435 --> 37:31.237
you know, that you go by the name.

37:31.277 --> 37:38.986
But then, of course, they were able to be taught, whether rightly or wrongly, yes, but we didn't think this was a particularly good novel, you know, isn't it a good lesson?

37:39.407 --> 37:41.910
But I think she had a point.

37:42.591 --> 37:44.693
It was a nice exercise.

37:44.954 --> 37:46.215
A very clever exercise.

37:46.575 --> 37:51.722
Is it fair to say, I mean, you're quite an unnervous reader, I think, is that a fact?

37:51.802 --> 37:52.442
Do you read?

37:52.763 --> 37:56.467
I read a lot, but I... How about in your younger years, did you read more?

37:56.728 --> 37:58.750
Oh, yes, I read, I read, yeah, but I...

37:59.033 --> 38:01.438
I'm not ashamed of this.

38:01.498 --> 38:04.545
I don't read a great deal of modern fiction.

38:04.605 --> 38:07.591
I'm not very knowledgeable about modern fiction.

38:07.611 --> 38:19.236
As I get older, I'm reading far more autobiography and re-reading, which may be just part of age.

38:19.688 --> 38:22.350
It's very common.

38:22.370 --> 38:25.934
I'm having a chapter in my new book about people who have been shaped by their reading.

38:26.514 --> 38:33.180
I've had interviews with Umberto Eppo and Maurice Sendak and Harold Bloom and Alfred Kays.

38:33.220 --> 38:35.302
Have you ever heard of Tilly Olsen, a woman?

38:35.342 --> 38:36.623
Yes, I have.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.385
She's in the 80s now.

38:39.666 --> 38:46.232
And I've been to her house and she has all these books that are literally falling apart from having been re-read, not read.

38:46.292 --> 38:49.695
And what I find is that in myself, as we get a little older,

38:50.182 --> 39:01.617
We go back to the, we find our greatest pleasure in re-reading, not so much in reading authors that we didn't grow up with, that really didn't help shape us as individuals.

39:01.838 --> 39:05.403
That's very true with me, yes.

39:05.423 --> 39:06.945
I go back to a lot of people.

39:07.025 --> 39:09.468
And who in particular do you find yourself going back to?

39:09.708 --> 39:16.898
Well, I can see in my own writing, absolutely, the influence of a rather diverse group who I would go back to.

39:16.878 --> 39:29.777
For detective writing, it's certainly Dorothy L. Sayers, who, although these are now period novels, and she certainly has a very snobbish detective, was a detective writer who wrote well, and I think enlarged the genre.

39:29.797 --> 39:36.186
Then it would be Graham Greene, Evelyn Wall, who I think is the greatest stylist of this generation.

39:36.419 --> 39:42.166
And, of course, Jane Austen.

39:42.186 --> 39:46.271
Jane Austen, I suppose, has influenced me profoundly about structure and irony.

39:46.291 --> 39:54.181
Green Green on the aspect of the world, the religious aspect of it, also the crime novel.

39:54.221 --> 39:59.828
And I think it's more just as a stylist.

40:00.348 --> 40:03.012
You see echoes of these writers in your own life?

40:03.032 --> 40:04.615
Oh, I can, yes, I can.

40:04.635 --> 40:10.283
I mean, suddenly, not mindfully, but certainly in a very subtle way you see things like that.

40:10.724 --> 40:11.625
Oh, I think so, yes.

40:11.645 --> 40:12.006
I think I do.

40:12.026 --> 40:18.255
And so, Corinna Dalgleish will be with us as long as you are capable to put words on paper.

40:18.376 --> 40:23.824
As long as I can think of ideas that really excite me.

40:24.007 --> 40:31.876
Really what happens is, I suppose I'm not a very professional writer in a way, but I don't finish a book with me, right, what will I do next?

40:32.096 --> 40:37.823
I suppose in part of my mind I'm thinking that, but I wait until I get an idea that really excites me.

40:38.003 --> 40:42.148
And in a few instances in recent years, you've gone off and done non-Dalgleish books.

40:43.169 --> 40:47.314
Yes, because I had an idea that excited me and I needed to deal with it.

40:47.497 --> 40:51.161
But I never think, oh, it is time I showed them I could do something different.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.964
I never despise the craft that showed the story.

40:54.104 --> 40:59.709
To me the honors, by the way, I think our time is running out, so I... May I put it to Nick?

40:59.810 --> 41:01.651
I would be honored.

41:01.932 --> 41:04.214
Here's my card, by the way, which you can take.

41:04.234 --> 41:05.455
Do you like Nick or Nicholas?

41:05.736 --> 41:09.259
I like Nicholas, but... Yeah, well, it's Nicholas's really nice name, isn't it?

41:09.279 --> 41:16.947
It's nice, with an H. You know Nicholas Barker, one of the keeper of books at the British Library?

41:17.112 --> 41:17.893
Yes, I do.

41:18.093 --> 41:19.534
Not personally very much.

41:19.554 --> 41:22.037
That's quite an interesting one.

41:22.337 --> 41:22.898
I've enjoyed this.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.960
Do you mind, by the way, if I take a photograph of you?

41:25.120 --> 41:26.181
Not a bit.

41:26.201 --> 41:30.405
I do have a number of customers who... This will be in 20 newspapers, by the way.

41:30.425 --> 41:41.937
I have a small syndicate of newspapers around the country who take... This is a New Sterely.

41:42.718 --> 41:47.102
I'm putting it with affection and admiration from the author.

41:47.538 --> 41:59.069
This is going to be a flash, you'll see.

41:59.149 --> 42:01.212
I took a picture of you while you were signing.

42:01.372 --> 42:01.732
Thank you.

42:02.293 --> 42:03.694
You can have that card if you'd like.

42:04.455 --> 42:05.776
It was affection and admiration.

42:05.796 --> 42:06.337
Your kind.

42:06.397 --> 42:08.579
Which is very genuine.

42:08.599 --> 42:12.923
Now if I can just have a picture of you.

42:12.943 --> 42:13.584
Thank you.

42:13.624 --> 42:14.625
Thank you.

42:14.645 --> 42:15.045
Oh, I love it.

42:15.065 --> 42:15.285
Thank you.

42:15.426 --> 42:15.726
Thank you.

42:15.746 --> 42:16.106
Thank you.

42:16.126 --> 42:16.887
Thank you.

42:17.137 --> 42:23.824
Okay, let's do that again.

42:23.844 --> 42:28.488
Let me try another one.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.331
I don't know if you want available right.

42:31.371 --> 42:34.074
This is my new, I got this in the seatbelt.

42:34.094 --> 42:35.155
This is a Contax.

42:35.615 --> 42:38.438
This is a new state-of-the-art little miniature camera.

42:38.518 --> 42:39.699
This is all professional quality.

42:40.460 --> 42:44.484
This is the person who's at in the background.

42:44.504 --> 42:44.904
That's nice.

42:44.964 --> 42:45.625
There we go.

42:47.326 --> 42:50.830
One more.

42:53.172 --> 42:53.833
There we go.

42:54.854 --> 42:55.935
How about one more with a flash?

42:55.996 --> 42:57.377
That's such a pretty smile.

42:58.839 --> 43:09.250
Would you like me to send you any copies of these, if you'd like?

43:09.370 --> 43:11.072
Yes, I would.

43:11.305 --> 43:14.409
And great luck, my dear, I thought, well, I mean, you don't need to.

43:14.490 --> 43:16.212
It's going to be a great success.

43:16.332 --> 43:19.016
Why don't you just write an address here, a P.O.

43:19.076 --> 43:19.857
box or something?

43:19.877 --> 43:22.661
Oh, I'll put my number of address.

43:22.681 --> 43:28.910
And that way I'll send you a copy of the story and I'll let you know where it's published.

43:28.930 --> 43:30.312
It'll be published in about 20 of these papers.

43:30.332 --> 43:35.099
My first book has got 60,000 copies in print.

43:35.119 --> 43:37.082
And it's still in print after three years.

43:37.202 --> 43:38.764
We're going into a seventh printing.

43:39.318 --> 43:46.572
This is a $35 book, so that's a lot of books for, you know, that cost.

43:46.592 --> 43:47.955
Your publisher must be delighted.

43:47.975 --> 43:51.822
Well, and they only gave me a tiny little grant, so they threw up and made so much money.

43:51.842 --> 43:53.606
And they earned out on the first day.

43:53.626 --> 43:55.550
Then you earned out, and you're still getting.

43:55.570 --> 43:59.858
On the first day, we had three printings in the first month of publication.

44:00.479 --> 44:02.842
And, oh, it's really, it was wonderful, because it's stories.

44:02.902 --> 44:04.164
I tell stories sometimes.

44:05.045 --> 44:07.768
Maybe I'll, if you'd like, may I send you a copy?

44:07.788 --> 44:08.449
Oh, I love a copy.

44:08.469 --> 44:09.110
Will you describe it for me?

44:09.170 --> 44:10.011
It's quite a nice book.

44:10.031 --> 44:11.773
It's about... I love a copy.

44:11.793 --> 44:13.275
Will you describe it for me?

44:13.335 --> 44:13.595
May I?

44:13.795 --> 44:14.757
For Phyllis.

44:14.837 --> 44:16.118
Yes, please.

44:16.339 --> 44:17.120
Absolutely.

44:17.140 --> 44:18.041
Just a question now.

44:18.061 --> 44:18.882
You're Baroness.

44:18.902 --> 44:21.004
You might take your quarters off.

44:21.024 --> 44:24.449
What is the proper way to address you formally?

44:24.469 --> 44:25.710
Lady or Baroness?

44:25.830 --> 44:26.131
Oh, yes.

44:26.151 --> 44:27.112
Either is all right.

44:27.292 --> 44:28.073
Either is all right.

44:28.441 --> 44:30.803
Baroness James or Lady James doesn't matter.

44:30.823 --> 44:32.906
It doesn't really matter at all.

44:32.926 --> 44:36.149
Some baronesses, just like the baroness, could be Lady James.

44:36.169 --> 44:46.119
They could be the wife of a knight, the wife of a baron, the wife of a baroness, the wife of a baroness, the wife of a woman.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.323
There's an American woman married high to a married Viscount Eccles.

44:50.824 --> 44:51.865
Oh, yes, she's Viscountess.

44:51.885 --> 44:53.747
She's Viscountess or a lady.

44:53.847 --> 44:54.748
Exactly.

44:54.768 --> 44:56.730
You could be Lady Eccles.

44:57.130 --> 44:57.891
There it is.

44:58.124 --> 45:07.041
The equivalent of being knighted?

45:07.101 --> 45:08.424
Dave.

45:08.444 --> 45:09.666
Dave.

45:09.686 --> 45:14.355
If I'd been the equivalent of a knight, I'd be Dave Phillips.

45:16.239 --> 45:19.666
So that's where you use the Christian name as opposed to the surname.

45:19.866 --> 45:20.507
That's the Christian name.

45:20.527 --> 45:20.908
Dave Phillips, yes.
