This magnificent suite on the 52nd floor.

00:28.358 --> 00:30.460
And another apartment upstairs

00:30.760 --> 00:45.700
I conduct my business because we had a Michigan Avenue location in the fine arts building, but my younger associate became ill, and his wife died suddenly, and I had to give up.

00:45.820 --> 00:54.912
At age 25, I was going to run two places, so we had a moving car.

00:54.932 --> 00:56.554
It's getting fixed again.

00:56.594 --> 00:58.877
It's a very lovely place, but it's moving.

01:08.071 --> 01:24.332
And people kept coming in.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.456
It was repressive.

01:29.919 --> 01:30.079
Wow.

01:39.138 --> 02:07.120
Thank you.

02:12.010 --> 02:13.952
Tremendous catalog.

02:19.259 --> 02:26.167
Love letters of votes.

02:26.568 --> 02:34.978
Edgar Lee Masters to his first life.

02:34.998 --> 02:41.646
Connect.

02:54.299 --> 03:20.172
Thank you.

03:26.362 --> 03:46.345
Oh, my God.
