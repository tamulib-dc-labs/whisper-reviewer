00:02.326 --> 00:04.968
Thank you for talking to Scott Theroux.

00:04.988 --> 00:05.669
Congratulations.

00:05.809 --> 00:06.410
I love the book.

00:06.810 --> 00:07.070
Good.

00:07.271 --> 00:07.691
Thank you.

00:07.891 --> 00:08.952
I love it, too, frankly.

00:08.972 --> 00:09.132
Thanks.

00:09.152 --> 00:10.674
It's really, it's a novel.

00:10.694 --> 00:12.836
Yeah, I think so, too.

00:13.657 --> 00:14.878
I feel really good about it.

00:15.238 --> 00:23.926
I, and indeed, one of the problems I've got as a writer right now is I've just got to get over this book and go on.

00:24.567 --> 00:30.072
I, I mean, I worked so many years on it, and it's,

00:30.980 --> 00:41.753
You know, there are so many different themes floating around, and the fact that I actually managed to get my arms around all of it was my proudest achievement as a writer.

00:42.414 --> 00:51.464
And now, so I sort of sat back and really smiled at myself for a number of months, and now I just have to get over this book and go and write something else.

00:51.484 --> 00:54.568
This took a little longer than the others, perhaps?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.932
It took a long, no, because you see, I started it right after a

00:58.435 --> 01:26.198
Actually, I started it before I finished The Burden of Proof, in the sense that I'd always wanted to do this 60s story, and when I handed in the initial draft of The Burden of Proof, I had parts written from Sonny Klonsky's point of view, and John Glassie said to me, well, look, you can't shift to her point of view two-thirds of the way through the book,

01:26.583 --> 01:29.166
If you want her to have a book, you know, you have to give her another book.

01:29.226 --> 01:30.849
And I said, Eureka, that's it.

01:30.869 --> 01:34.173
That's how I'm going to write about the 60s through Sonny.

01:34.593 --> 01:36.816
That was my starting point, and that was 89.

01:36.856 --> 01:39.800
Did you, in your mind, know her history at that point?

01:39.820 --> 01:42.143
Well, I stuck it in the burden of proof.

01:42.163 --> 01:45.327
If you go back to the burden of proof, you look, and there'll be a few lines.

01:45.467 --> 01:50.154
I haven't seen how faithful to that I was, but it's close.

01:50.254 --> 01:51.315
It's close enough.

01:51.335 --> 01:53.017
Do you want something to drink, Nick?

01:53.077 --> 01:53.738
No, no.

01:53.758 --> 01:54.379
You sure?

01:55.709 --> 01:57.591
water or something now?

01:57.611 --> 01:57.791
Okay.

01:58.612 --> 02:00.154
All right.

02:00.174 --> 02:11.968
So, I knew that she was going to be in California, this philosophy student, end up in the Peace Corps, all of that.

02:12.089 --> 02:15.072
That was all plotted out in there, in the Burden of Proof.

02:15.713 --> 02:20.839
And then the stuff with Seth,

02:21.494 --> 02:29.202
The boyfriend came next, and his conflict with his parents, and the staged kidnapping, that whole thing.

02:31.144 --> 02:33.586
But I knew that I wanted to write a contemporary story.

02:35.168 --> 02:36.329
I knew she was a judge.

02:36.349 --> 02:38.631
It was a logical next step in her career.

02:38.651 --> 02:42.495
I thought it would be really interesting to tell the story of a trial from a judge's point of view.

02:45.418 --> 02:48.261
But I couldn't figure out what the hell the case was.

02:48.832 --> 02:57.464
In 90 and 91, when I was really home and away writing, I was writing as if Seth's divorce case.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.909
In other words, she and Seth had broken up 25 years later.

03:00.949 --> 03:05.415
Lo and behold, here's her ex, about to be the ex from somebody else.

03:06.497 --> 03:12.445
And I said to myself, this just doesn't fit what the rest of the book is about.

03:12.465 --> 03:16.611
And so I jettisoned it and wrote Pleading Guilty.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.013
So you put this on the shelf?

03:19.173 --> 03:27.180
I put it on the shelf, confident that if I took the time, I would know what I wanted to write about.

03:28.000 --> 03:47.037
Well, and I began, I was doing pro bono work down at 26th Street in Chicago in the state courts, and all of a sudden it hit me and said, this, this is what connects.

03:47.320 --> 03:51.326
these are the kinds of cases she's hearing.

03:51.606 --> 03:58.437
She's looking at this, the dim legacy of the ideologies of the 60s.

03:59.899 --> 04:03.845
This is where she is, and that's the kind of case it has to be.

04:03.865 --> 04:09.593
And I said, well, how do I get all this stuff about fathers and sons and mothers and daughters into this?

04:09.954 --> 04:12.277
And that's how the plot... So it was fathers and sons, though.

04:12.297 --> 04:15.041
That clearly was... That was clear for Seth's story.

04:15.142 --> 04:15.542
Yeah, yeah.

04:15.582 --> 04:16.804
But I mean, to have...

04:17.341 --> 04:21.285
of the novel, I think, with all these, I mean, it's a theme that we see.

04:21.305 --> 04:22.246
Right, absolutely.

04:22.687 --> 04:23.167
Absolutely.

04:23.187 --> 04:25.270
On every level, I mean, with everyone.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.371
Right.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.914
So that was, did you have the title at that point?

04:31.216 --> 04:43.129
Yeah, I did, and I remain convinced that I've heard that term somewhere, and I think what it is, it's actually a direct translation of

04:44.560 --> 04:46.762
It's seldom employed anymore.

04:46.823 --> 04:51.328
The Torah is sometimes referred to as the Torah of our fathers.

04:51.348 --> 05:00.498
And all of these of our fathers stuff has been dropped out of the liturgy because it's not gender neutral.

05:00.518 --> 05:05.724
But it's a phrase I grew up with as a kid and the laws of our fathers.

05:06.184 --> 05:13.352
So I wanted its sort of liturgical echo and

05:15.813 --> 05:24.204
in the sense that it creates a conflict between fathers and sons.

05:25.506 --> 05:31.795
I mean, undoubtedly there's a sequence of coincidences here between all these characters.

05:31.815 --> 05:32.095
Right.

05:32.135 --> 05:33.237
It is kind of nice.

05:33.257 --> 05:36.040
It's almost a throwback while the characters are brought together.

05:36.060 --> 05:36.361
Right.

05:36.741 --> 05:37.422
Absolutely.

05:37.442 --> 05:37.843
Reunited.

05:37.983 --> 05:38.804
Absolutely.

05:39.385 --> 05:40.687
In action.

05:40.707 --> 05:44.672
Were you fearful of that device?

05:45.260 --> 05:55.434
Well, I mean, every novel's gotta have a device of some kind.

05:56.035 --> 06:06.730
And this is the problem with this device, it seemed to me, and always is, not that it's unreal.

06:06.750 --> 06:12.718
While I was writing this, and worrying about this concatenation of events,

06:13.205 --> 06:18.114
A fellow happened to be charged with bilking his law firm in Chicago.

06:18.134 --> 06:20.959
Who does he arrive, who does he hire for his lawyer?

06:21.099 --> 06:23.263
Of course, one of his law school classmates.

06:23.283 --> 06:28.292
And who does he arrive before for sentencing but another of their law school classmates?

06:28.312 --> 06:31.878
And I watched carefully because this judge never took himself off the case.

06:32.660 --> 06:36.647
And I said to myself, so here's my case.

06:39.445 --> 06:40.726
And it's a small world.

06:40.806 --> 06:41.887
And it's a small world.

06:41.947 --> 06:43.389
Meeting the legal profession.

06:43.489 --> 06:43.969
Right.

06:44.189 --> 06:45.711
You've got to move in circles.

06:45.731 --> 06:45.951
Right.

06:46.091 --> 06:50.495
But I think it's more the coincidence than the fact that I don't think she has to accuse herself.

06:50.515 --> 06:52.697
I really don't think she has to disqualify herself.

06:52.717 --> 06:56.140
It's the coincidence of all those people ending up in the courtroom.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.262
Were you mindful with this O.J.

06:58.282 --> 07:00.244
Simpson thing to have this judge?

07:01.965 --> 07:08.932
It couldn't have been possible in that case where the judge could have tried this thing without a jury.

07:08.952 --> 07:09.452
Sure he could.

07:10.141 --> 07:11.062
Ito could attach, right?

07:11.082 --> 07:11.482
Is that right?

07:11.983 --> 07:14.045
Yeah, but I had the defense asked for it.

07:14.065 --> 07:15.366
It would have been suicidal.

07:15.386 --> 07:19.851
The defense would never have asked for it in that case, because in that case, O.J.

07:19.871 --> 07:21.032
Simpson would have been convicted.

07:21.052 --> 07:21.513
That's right.

07:22.253 --> 07:24.015
So it made sense to go to a jury.

07:24.075 --> 07:25.336
Right.

07:25.356 --> 07:26.237
But I like that.

07:26.297 --> 07:29.340
In fact, here in New York, this was a major case just last week.

07:29.381 --> 07:32.604
You don't have to read the New York Times or a cop.

07:32.624 --> 07:37.489
The defense actually asked that.

07:37.549 --> 07:38.730
It happens all the time.

07:39.335 --> 07:42.258
You have a lot of big murder cases that are done as bench trials.

07:42.378 --> 07:51.687
I mean, this, of course, becomes, you know, one of the elements of a plot, which is why would he do this?

07:51.747 --> 07:54.489
Why would Hobie do this?

07:54.689 --> 08:00.295
What scheme does he have in his head in requesting the bench trial?

08:00.315 --> 08:05.279
Because it's, you know, it seems odd at the time.

08:05.299 --> 08:07.782
What is he doing exactly?

08:07.802 --> 08:09.223
It's pretty brilliant.

08:10.469 --> 08:14.535
And he would have won, actually, as he tells the prosecutor.

08:14.555 --> 08:14.795
Right.

08:15.136 --> 08:15.857
Clearly he would have won.

08:15.897 --> 08:16.758
The reader knows that.

08:16.818 --> 08:17.700
The reader knows that.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.646
And you really did put yourself in the mind of a judge, Dave, didn't you?

08:21.706 --> 08:22.307
Was that hard?

08:23.488 --> 08:23.749
No.

08:23.969 --> 08:28.957
I mean, I think... I think... Every lawyer sees it that way.

08:28.977 --> 08:33.343
Sees what they would do if they were in the middle.

08:33.363 --> 08:35.346
I thought that was terrific.

08:36.254 --> 08:39.958
I thought it was a very interesting perspective for readers, though.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.099
And you set me up.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.222
I didn't expect it to be strong.

08:43.242 --> 08:45.484
I have to say, you absolutely caught me.

08:45.985 --> 08:50.149
He asked for it, and she said, ah, I'm out.

08:50.169 --> 08:50.570
I'm out.

08:50.590 --> 08:51.150
I'm out of here.

08:51.170 --> 08:53.213
How the hell did I do this to myself?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.795
Well, I'm not doing it to myself again.

08:55.815 --> 08:57.077
It was wonderful.

08:57.097 --> 09:02.663
And she got away from the pressure that they were laying on her and all this other stuff.

09:02.683 --> 09:04.084
That was a nice thing.

09:04.164 --> 09:05.586
I certainly won't blow that in there yet.

09:06.190 --> 09:09.654
This is by no means a legal thriller.

09:09.674 --> 09:14.740
Maybe I'm wrong on that, but it's a... Well, it certainly speaks heavily in the law.

09:17.002 --> 09:34.763
It is, and... I mean, look, there's obviously a mystery in the sense of who did try to kill June Edgar, and the book essentially answers that.

09:36.397 --> 09:45.588
I've always, you know, I am really caught as an author in a certain fundamental dilemma.

09:45.768 --> 10:04.210
I have always believed that contemporary fiction went wrong when it decided in the shadow of Lionel Trilling, announcing the death of the novel, to

10:04.797 --> 10:08.241
to adhere strictly to the middle range of experience.

10:08.261 --> 10:20.113
You know, the books by Bellow, for example, which I admire gigantically, but which are basically plotless, because... And thus boring, I can say that.

10:20.574 --> 10:30.824
And thus, they deserted the great kind of middle range of readers who read not only for enlightenment, but entertainment.

10:30.844 --> 10:33.387
And so, you know, when I wrote Presumed Innocence,

10:33.923 --> 10:45.337
Obviously, I discovered that I had a skill in a genre I'd never considered writing in, and that's the reason, of course, first and foremost, that I do it.

10:45.938 --> 10:55.931
But I also thought this is a way to write for a larger audience that will be of interest to a larger audience.

10:55.951 --> 10:59.155
That doesn't necessarily mean renouncing serious purposes.

10:59.793 --> 11:08.564
But the problem with the mystery, of course, is the formal one, which is, you know, you've got it at the beginning, the middle, and the end.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.685
You've got to say whodunit.

11:11.247 --> 11:26.286
And the thing I like about this book is that it better escapes than any of my other novels, the restrictions of the form.

11:26.306 --> 11:28.669
You know, it just opens up.

11:28.953 --> 11:46.192
I've always been trying, but this book finds the way out in what, so far to me, the most satisfying way.

11:46.812 --> 11:51.637
So, when you say it's not really a legal thriller, I understand what you mean.

11:52.458 --> 11:53.820
It aspires to be a novel.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.922
Well, and I meant it in that context.

11:56.122 --> 12:09.739
To me, it's a nice, big novel, and I like nice, big, multi-layered, textured novels with a number of stories coming together and feeding off each other.

12:10.159 --> 12:16.206
Of course, in your 60s element, the Vietnam War element, I mean, that's by no means illegal.

12:17.428 --> 12:18.429
I guess it is.

12:18.449 --> 12:21.152
Well, it's a crime story in the end.

12:22.134 --> 12:24.897
But is this for you, then,

12:25.265 --> 12:26.947
your 60s novel?

12:27.007 --> 12:28.329
Yeah, this is my 60s novel.

12:28.349 --> 12:29.411
I don't think I'll go back.

12:29.451 --> 12:33.076
Kind of the thing you felt you, at some point, had to confront?

12:33.096 --> 12:34.958
Yes, I absolutely had to confront it.

12:35.098 --> 12:36.260
I had to write this book.

12:37.181 --> 12:44.752
You know, I, large elements of this are autobiographical.

12:44.772 --> 12:52.582
Not that I ever posed as being kidnapped or, but, you know, I certainly lived out in the Bay Area in those times.

12:52.643 --> 12:54.445
So, Seth plays a lot of yourself in it.

12:54.577 --> 12:55.658
Seth has got a lot of me.

12:55.779 --> 12:57.181
There's no question about that.

12:57.221 --> 13:17.368
I'm not ... I mean, I'm a lot different than Seth, and I'm not quite as ... I'm probably not as nice as he is, nor am I as absorbed in my own vulnerabilities, or at least as sorry for myself as he is.

13:17.388 --> 13:21.273
But, you know, his view of the world and mine are probably not very far apart.

13:21.313 --> 13:24.297
Same thing, of course, could be said for Sonny.

13:24.530 --> 13:36.067
You know, these people, both of them, have a sensibility, probably more like my own than any character I've written, including Rusty Sandwich.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.652
So, I mean, there's that.

13:39.672 --> 13:50.108
What in particular did you feel that you wanted to exercise?

13:50.128 --> 13:51.410
Just your experiences from the 60s?

13:51.590 --> 13:53.693
Look, I think...

13:55.833 --> 14:11.246
that for people of my age, and by that I mean basically your boomer group, the 60s were the formative experience of their lifetime.

14:11.266 --> 14:18.693
And I think the 60s left a legacy of questions that really are, to a great extent, unanswered.

14:18.773 --> 14:24.658
I think most American politics has been about the issues that were raised by the 60s.

14:25.229 --> 14:29.675
We keep pretending that we've got it all resolved when I don't think we do.

14:31.418 --> 14:39.870
You know, we really...we're not close to answering the questions about equality that we think we have.

14:41.052 --> 14:48.062
We're not close to having dealt for the last time with the notion of communitarianism.

14:48.623 --> 14:54.932
We think that because, you know, the commies are gone, that the notion that

14:55.418 --> 15:01.106
people owe a duty to each other to share more broadly than Americans want to share at the moment.

15:01.126 --> 15:02.347
We think that's gone away.

15:02.708 --> 15:03.489
It hasn't gone away.

15:03.549 --> 15:11.279
That's going to come back, and it's going to come back with vehemence at some time, probably pretty soon.

15:13.763 --> 15:20.892
So, I mean, I just saw a lot in the 60s that was unresolved in America, and certainly that was unresolved in me.

15:21.894 --> 15:24.497
And, of course, the decisions that put in the immediate presence

15:25.051 --> 15:29.597
You cover six months, and it's September in 95, and there are people in 96.

15:29.698 --> 15:30.919
Right, right, right.

15:31.380 --> 15:35.506
So it is very focused in that respect, in terms of the time frame.

15:35.566 --> 15:35.866
Absolutely.

15:35.886 --> 15:36.728
And there's a necessity.

15:37.088 --> 15:39.331
There's going to be a lot of continuances and things.

15:39.351 --> 15:42.556
It's going to be a bench trial, and we're going to get to it.

15:42.656 --> 15:45.019
It's not going to go in for 10 months.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.922
It's going to be right there.

15:47.022 --> 15:53.151
But then you also allow yourself to go back and to develop the histories of all these characters.

15:53.553 --> 16:01.219
Did you think, obviously, the sins of the fathers, I mean, you can see this on any number of levels in the novel.

16:01.239 --> 16:12.909
I mean, the prime culprit, but then you have sex, and you don't have sin so much, but you have a zoology, a letter at the end, and it all resembles the daughter, you know?

16:12.929 --> 16:14.971
So it really is a generational... Absolutely.

16:15.772 --> 16:16.673
It keeps on rolling.

16:16.793 --> 16:23.138
And it's not sins, necessarily, in every respect, but it is, I hate to use the word baggage, it's inheritance.

16:23.472 --> 16:33.166
And it's the, I mean, the pivotal question is, how do you define yourself with and still accept the past?

16:35.209 --> 16:39.555
And, I mean, that's a struggle for every generation.

16:39.575 --> 16:48.889
And, you know, how does that express, how do those struggles express themselves in terms of values, you know, political and personal?

16:49.730 --> 16:54.735
Let me just say, and I'll say this in my piece, and I really admire what you did here.

16:54.755 --> 16:56.116
It was risky.

16:56.136 --> 16:56.237
Yeah.

16:56.257 --> 17:00.741
It had to be, and you had to be mindful of this when you were doing it.

17:00.841 --> 17:03.123
I was very mindful of it, and to some extent.

17:03.143 --> 17:14.955
You've got a captive, I can say this, you've got a captive readership out there, people who really are eager to read the next, and maybe there's an expectation that it's going to be a certain kind of a book.

17:14.975 --> 17:17.678
You're not giving them necessarily what they might be expecting.

17:17.962 --> 17:21.706
I, you know, I think I've deviated with each book.

17:21.747 --> 17:39.768
I think there's a lot of risk in that, and I think at some levels, you know, I can argue the other side of this and say, you know, it's highly plotted, it's Rebecca McCourtman, which is where you were presumed innocent.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.550
People seem to be fascinated with that.

17:42.051 --> 17:47.277
So maybe it's not as risky at that level, but the scope of the book is obviously

17:47.712 --> 17:50.376
a lot to bite off as a writer.

17:50.436 --> 17:54.782
And, you know, as I said, I feel good that I managed to do it.

17:55.002 --> 18:00.710
Are you making some kind of a creative statement with this book, seems to say?

18:00.730 --> 18:03.754
You know, the fact that it's your point now?

18:06.598 --> 18:08.501
Look, I think it's a really good book.

18:08.801 --> 18:12.527
I mean, but ask me what I think about it five years from now.

18:12.647 --> 18:17.213
Right now, I think it's far and away the best book that I've written.

18:17.699 --> 18:29.350
And I've summed up more of my own life in this book than I ever have before, frankly, thought I could do.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.272
In a novel?

18:31.292 --> 18:31.953
In a novel.

18:31.973 --> 18:33.454
In the first book.

18:33.474 --> 18:34.095
Right.

18:34.115 --> 18:44.685
No, but I mean, just in terms of really dealing with the things that have moved through me, does that necessarily make it good?

18:44.952 --> 18:47.556
That wasn't my question.

18:47.576 --> 18:49.378
Am I making a creative statement?

18:49.598 --> 18:56.668
I think I'm making a creative statement, but I think it's one that, frankly, be consistently consistent.

18:57.149 --> 19:01.114
Well, did you have, you've been through this since you took a book.

19:02.676 --> 19:06.201
Do you have any apprehensions when you put one of these babies out there?

19:06.461 --> 19:08.604
I have tremendous apprehensions, yeah.

19:08.624 --> 19:11.989
You know, I don't, you know,

19:12.712 --> 19:14.173
If he writes it, will they come?

19:14.353 --> 19:28.085
You know, I have no idea at what point those great masses who scooped up, you know, the three prior novels are going to disappear.

19:28.546 --> 19:32.690
And I don't know if this book is going to drive them away or bring them in in droves.

19:33.290 --> 19:36.473
And, you know, we're all going to find out.

19:37.634 --> 19:42.398
I just, two weeks ago, in fact, it's a piece I ran this week on this very street,

19:43.137 --> 19:46.382
three blocks down, and then the viewer, Neil Simon.

19:46.882 --> 19:47.403
Mm-hmm.

19:47.423 --> 19:48.064
Nice man.

19:48.344 --> 19:50.728
Oh, lovely, lovely man.

19:51.228 --> 20:07.551
And we were talking, and again, I'm really interested in the process, you know, I created a process, and the duty of playwriting, of course, is that you know, incidentally, you know, the day it's opening night, you think, you know, if it's a hit or if it's not, if you score it, if you haven't.

20:08.032 --> 20:11.777
And of course, he's written for television, which he detests.

20:12.044 --> 20:16.088
movies, which you guys don't like, so that's how he pays the rent.

20:16.108 --> 20:19.312
And of course, even I asked him to visualize the audience.

20:19.332 --> 20:23.216
I don't have a clue with television.

20:23.236 --> 20:24.657
Film could be something else.

20:24.697 --> 20:30.603
He said, there's 1,000 intelligent people in that theater that night, and that's who I'm writing for.

20:30.623 --> 20:36.870
And I guess what I'm driving to here is, and not the critics, because you never know what the critics are going to say.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.344
You know, he's had his raps, too.

20:39.364 --> 20:44.990
People don't realize, you know, he had a couple of plays that ended up for a 30 or 40 performance.

20:45.010 --> 20:45.190
Right.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.893
Stashman and Pharrell was one.

20:47.913 --> 20:55.020
A very circuitous way of asking, do you have a sense of your audience who you read it is?

20:55.040 --> 20:57.142
I think I have a sense of an ideal reader.

20:58.103 --> 21:04.849
But, in point of fact, you know, I did a book signing last night in Washington.

21:06.061 --> 21:08.805
It was sobering and inspiring and delightful.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.771
You know, people stood in line for an hour and a half.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.074
And who were my readers?

21:16.376 --> 21:23.887
My readers were literally every shape, size, every age, every color.

21:23.907 --> 21:24.508
And that's great.

21:24.869 --> 21:33.942
You know, they were, some were attorneys and clearly attorneys with very sophisticated practices.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.052
Some were government bureaucrats.

21:36.132 --> 21:38.215
Some were those bureaucrat secretaries.

21:38.295 --> 21:46.444
I mean, some, you know, one woman showed up and said, you know, she was buying this for the 18 people in her office, and they were going to pass it around.

21:47.445 --> 21:51.049
And the person behind said, oh, no, no, no, everybody should buy their own copy.

21:51.069 --> 21:54.072
I said, hey, for the author, it's great.

21:54.092 --> 21:56.295
I said, what an author wants is readers.

21:57.756 --> 22:01.060
And, you know, I...

22:02.896 --> 22:08.704
I don't have a full sense who my audience is, but I tell you one thing, I am grateful as hell to them.

22:10.026 --> 22:31.235
I really am, and I try desperately not to, you know, to talk down to them, and I hope, you know, I hope they're willing to follow me in this book, and, you know, put up with, put up with it, and I think that there's a substantial reward for them.

22:31.255 --> 22:32.076
Like I said, it's not,

22:32.613 --> 22:37.119
taken from the personal reads a lot.

22:37.139 --> 22:38.441
It's not a tedious read, you know.

22:38.781 --> 22:39.442
I mean, it's not.

22:39.462 --> 22:41.244
I would tell you that.

22:41.264 --> 22:46.331
It's a very effortless read that we really do get involved with the characters and their stories.

22:46.351 --> 22:47.873
And there is a definite mystery.

22:47.893 --> 22:50.637
What the hell is going on here?

22:50.697 --> 22:55.583
And I have to say, I mean, I'm the guy that figured out prison and genocide.

22:55.724 --> 22:57.146
I'm listening to a couple of things.

22:57.166 --> 22:59.489
I didn't figure out this one.

22:59.509 --> 23:02.012
The fact that you smuggling drugs in the mariner and it makes perfect sense.

23:02.532 --> 23:06.917
And then, of course, it makes sense with the father.

23:07.077 --> 23:08.638
It was very, very clever.

23:10.581 --> 23:10.881
Thank you.

23:11.061 --> 23:11.702
Congratulations.

23:11.862 --> 23:12.943
Thank you.

23:12.963 --> 23:25.637
Is this the kind of thing, again, I don't give anything away, but in terms of applauding, is this something you're working towards, or do you pretty much know that this is where it is at the end of the Elmore Grove?

23:25.657 --> 23:28.860
You know, people always ask me this, and I don't

23:31.760 --> 23:38.929
I mean, obviously I knew there had to be a connection between the back story, which was what was written first and the present.

23:39.950 --> 23:44.436
And I was damned for the longest period of time if I could figure it out.

23:45.437 --> 24:01.497
And I really just started with this murder, and I knew he had to be accused of murdering one of his parents.

24:01.713 --> 24:04.798
Again, because of the themes of the back story.

24:04.818 --> 24:11.808
And then, of course, I had to explain it, and it did come to me.

24:11.828 --> 24:13.670
And it did seem to me to make a lot of sense.

24:13.751 --> 24:20.120
I thought... I mean, you outlined, you thought, you were just... I just live with it.

24:20.140 --> 24:21.001
Yeah.

24:21.021 --> 24:22.483
I ferment.

24:22.844 --> 24:27.030
And how were you able to do your love practice?

24:27.290 --> 24:27.771
I said to you.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.172
compartmentalize the things?

24:30.413 --> 24:34.118
It's very uncompartmentalized.

24:34.959 --> 24:48.018
Through most of the time I was writing this book, I was in the office three days a week, and usually I write in the mornings, and I'll practice at home, and I practice in the afternoon.

24:48.819 --> 24:56.610
Two of those days, I try to cheat a little, get a little more time at home, and then after lunch, pick up the phone and take phone calls.

24:57.164 --> 25:02.891
And the other three days, I'm downtown in the office.

25:02.911 --> 25:07.677
And, you know, when clients need me, they'll call me in the morning at home.

25:07.697 --> 25:18.389
And, you know, the clients I have are the clients who both understand my situation and have a sense of discretion and don't call me tirelessly at home.

25:19.831 --> 25:24.657
And one of my great gifts is that I can pick up the phone,

25:25.480 --> 25:34.131
talk to a client, talk to them sometimes for 40 minutes, put it down, make a note, send a fax, whatever it is, and then pick up where I was writing in the middle of the sound.

25:34.151 --> 25:35.513
That's amazing.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.756
And that's a real gift.

25:37.776 --> 25:45.206
Well, I think it comes from surviving as a writer for so many years under such difficult circumstances.

25:45.226 --> 25:48.130
So, you know, writing on the commuter train.

25:48.210 --> 25:53.597
And I probably owe my high school journalism teacher, Robert Boyle, a real

25:56.092 --> 26:09.349
Thank you for that, because he taught us in this journalism class that we would not... He said, I don't want you to be like monks.

26:09.389 --> 26:12.573
He said, I want you to all write in the same room.

26:12.593 --> 26:15.877
He said, I want you to be able to write with typewriters clacking.

26:15.897 --> 26:21.424
He said, don't treat yourself like Proust, but you have to be in a court line.

26:22.518 --> 26:23.760
And so I learned.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.082
You know, I've gone the other way.

26:25.202 --> 26:27.965
I'm brought up in this whole tradition.

26:27.985 --> 26:28.106
Right.

26:28.126 --> 26:28.706
That I love it.

26:28.907 --> 26:37.959
And I can perform, but since I left the paper, you know, in just over five years, working at home, I love silence.

26:38.039 --> 26:38.460
I'll bet.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.682
It's wonderful.

26:39.702 --> 26:40.122
I'll bet.

26:40.483 --> 26:43.847
It's really, it's precious.

26:43.887 --> 26:46.751
Tell me, you know, are you working on a movie?

26:46.771 --> 26:49.555
Because I don't want a pinch on your next story, maybe a few years back then.

26:50.311 --> 26:54.356
a new novel in progress?

26:54.376 --> 26:59.582
Well, as I said to start, I've been less disciplined about giving up this book than I should have been.

26:59.722 --> 27:03.126
Yeah, I have a book that I really need to do some research on.

27:03.146 --> 27:07.991
It's probably in some ways further along than I usually am at this stage.

27:08.732 --> 27:19.845
I'm going to have to fill in some holes, and I'm going to spend some time when I get back to my life in Chicago in December, hanging around with personal injury lawyers, and I want to

27:20.450 --> 27:25.495
learn a little bit about their world, and the characters are really well mapped out in my head.

27:25.515 --> 27:28.498
The plot is pretty well known.

27:28.518 --> 27:30.280
So, I don't know how long it'll take to write.

27:30.300 --> 27:34.004
And do you foresee setting everything in this region?

27:34.024 --> 27:38.188
It's going, yes, we're definitely back in Kimball County again.

27:38.448 --> 27:38.869
Definitely.

27:38.989 --> 27:42.392
What exactly are the quiet cities and the tri-city?

27:42.412 --> 27:43.113
Tri-city.

27:43.153 --> 27:43.473
Tri-city.

27:43.493 --> 27:45.195
Are these real cities?

27:45.215 --> 27:49.039
I was out in Kansas City a couple weeks ago.

27:49.407 --> 27:51.149
I saw some of the Quad Cities.

27:51.209 --> 27:51.749
Right.

27:52.110 --> 27:57.295
Right.

27:57.315 --> 28:01.760
There are faint resemblances to half a dozen urban areas.

28:02.561 --> 28:09.588
Do you think that you're comfortable writing in the law?

28:09.748 --> 28:10.849
Do you ever see yourself leaving?

28:12.371 --> 28:16.495
Well, you know, frankly, this seemed unimaginable to me.

28:16.964 --> 28:25.171
The first time you asked me this question, about 10 years ago, it's now 10 years later.

28:26.152 --> 28:31.837
And, you know, there are two realities here.

28:32.017 --> 28:34.439
One is I'm getting older.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.543
My energy level is not what it was 10 years ago.

28:38.563 --> 28:41.345
And the other is I've been doing the same thing for 10 years longer.

28:42.366 --> 28:46.650
So I would like to continue to find new challenges in the law.

28:47.727 --> 28:53.294
And I don't really imagine leaving the legal environment completely.

28:55.357 --> 28:57.760
Teaching still doesn't feel right to me.

28:59.903 --> 29:02.486
So, I don't know what the alternatives are.

29:02.587 --> 29:15.844
I really love my partners, but I wish that my, I wish that it weren't the case that my clients seem to have emergencies whenever I'm unavailable.

29:16.297 --> 29:21.444
And, you know, I wish it weren't the case that unethical opponents still exist.

29:21.524 --> 29:24.188
There are things that drive you out of the practice.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.772
So, you know, for the time being, I'm still there.

29:27.813 --> 29:28.513
But you enjoy it.

29:28.794 --> 29:29.315
I love it.

29:29.755 --> 29:30.716
I really do enjoy it.

29:30.736 --> 29:35.102
And if you didn't get out of that courthouse, you wouldn't have figured out what Sonny was doing.

29:35.122 --> 29:35.683
Absolutely.

29:36.244 --> 29:39.168
You know, so there's... No, I mean, that's real.

29:39.248 --> 29:41.511
I mean, I don't... It is real.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.793
I could do a little less than I do and still absorb a lot.

29:47.173 --> 29:51.499
You know, and I really feel like I've got a lifetime worth of stories already.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.423
But, I don't know.

29:54.984 --> 29:59.290
You know, life is really is the burden of proof set again and again.

29:59.330 --> 30:02.554
Life is full of surprises, and I'll see where things take.

30:02.855 --> 30:07.101
And, you didn't feel any risk at all?

30:07.121 --> 30:12.308
I mean, a white guy in his 40s

30:12.625 --> 30:14.367
using an African-American violin.

30:14.387 --> 30:15.769
Did I feel a risk in that?

30:15.789 --> 30:18.072
Yes, I felt a tremendous risk in that.

30:18.512 --> 30:25.801
And I'm yet to hear... I'm yet to hear any criticism.

30:26.401 --> 30:27.843
I worked like hell at that.

30:27.883 --> 30:29.725
I mean, I worked like hell at that.

30:29.826 --> 30:35.272
I did not want somebody telling me about that.

30:36.073 --> 30:40.058
And I really studied that language carefully.

30:40.078 --> 30:41.940
And of course, I had a point tonight.

30:42.545 --> 31:09.126
I want Americans to really look hard at the degree of separation that exists for the black poor and the fact that with all of our 60s ideologies, whether they were black separation or benign neglect, that we have allowed a segment of our society to dwell in conditions that are unimaginably horrible.

31:09.646 --> 31:22.098
and that they really and truly no longer speak our language, and that unless we mend that division, and that requires tremendous effort in both communities, we are headed for disaster.

31:23.039 --> 31:29.746
So, and so this was, you mindfully worked this in as a commentary?

31:29.766 --> 31:30.166
Mindfully.

31:30.266 --> 31:38.134
I did not want to be, I mean, I figure you can't write about the 60s without writing about race, and I will not write about race.

31:38.468 --> 31:41.431
just from white people's points of view.

31:43.934 --> 31:59.632
And I will not respect the politically correct pieties that say that black experience belongs only to blacks, just like I wouldn't respect the less entrenched rule that a man can't write about a woman.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.855
That's not what literature's about.

32:02.395 --> 32:05.018
Literature is about imaginative transposition.

32:05.279 --> 32:08.222
It's about what it's like to stand in somebody else's shoes.

32:08.776 --> 32:24.270
And again, you know, I think some of the minimalist impulse in today's fiction is to avoid crossing any of those political lines.

32:24.390 --> 32:29.014
I mean, this is obviously a novel in the 19th century tradition.

32:29.034 --> 32:34.138
It sees lots of different points of view, lots of different range in society.

32:35.039 --> 32:37.321
And, you know, I wanted to do that.

32:37.341 --> 32:38.142
This is a great book.

32:38.628 --> 32:47.117
Do you have any opinion at all on this raging debate that's been going on?

32:47.778 --> 32:52.623
And this is not for this piece, but for possibilities in this book.

32:52.643 --> 33:00.732
I'm literally asking every writer I talk to, you just had a very interesting comment on what literature is and what it isn't.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.656
Well, I mean, this is one I really see from both sides.

33:04.736 --> 33:08.280
The problem is that this is when...

33:09.104 --> 33:26.428
the notion of broad tastes and the recognition that the house of literature has many rooms, which is an important thing to recognize and accept, when that all of a sudden becomes an orthodoxy.

33:26.448 --> 33:38.605
And, you know, it is certainly the case that there's a lot of great writing by name your oppressed group, African Americans or women or Kurds or

33:39.074 --> 33:44.543
whoever, that has not been appropriately appreciated.

33:44.883 --> 33:51.854
That's certainly true, but that doesn't mean that you should throw out Shakespeare.

33:51.874 --> 33:52.195
That's right.

33:52.215 --> 34:04.474
Well, let me just say and interject, how do you respond to the news that, for instance, you can get a degree in English literature now, not literature, English, English literature, Georgetown University,

34:05.517 --> 34:09.483
without being required to study Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, Espresso.

34:09.503 --> 34:12.507
I, I, I, what good is that degree?

34:14.009 --> 34:33.356
I was sitting at the dinner table with the president of Amherst College, Tom Garry, when he was informed that they had, Amherst had graduated as summa in English the prior year, who had never had granted Shakespeare.

34:33.376 --> 34:33.656
Oh, thank you.

34:33.676 --> 34:34.798
I'd like that with your next interview.

34:38.187 --> 34:44.774
I'd like to have that again, if it's all possible.

34:44.794 --> 34:45.114
Okay.

34:45.194 --> 35:04.954
Well, I said that I was sitting at the dinner table of the president of Amherst College, Tom Garry, when he was informed, he was informed, by one of the members of his faculty that Amherst had graduated a summa in English who had not taken a course in Shakespeare.

35:06.031 --> 35:07.072
That's extraordinary.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.714
And Tom just sat there and looked.

35:08.734 --> 35:09.555
He said, we did.

35:10.657 --> 35:11.017
We did.

35:11.117 --> 35:13.400
Now, can I use this in some way?

35:13.700 --> 35:14.121
Go ahead.

35:14.361 --> 35:18.186
He said, not only was he.

35:18.206 --> 35:19.788
I might pursue it if it's okay with you.

35:19.808 --> 35:20.248
Not only was he.

35:20.268 --> 35:22.851
I didn't have to say where I heard it.

35:22.871 --> 35:32.303
Well, the poet who told the story was April, redhead, charming woman, and a good writer.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.065
Did it just very recently happen?

35:34.625 --> 35:35.987
It was within the last two years.

35:36.187 --> 35:40.230
Now, everybody there was a member of the English department faculty.

35:40.551 --> 35:44.234
So, therefore, you can get a degree in Amherst without having to take a course in Shakespeare.

35:44.254 --> 35:44.974
But a SUMA!

35:44.994 --> 35:46.315
They graduated in SUMA.

35:46.396 --> 35:46.636
I know.

35:46.656 --> 35:49.038
We're all actually called the head of the English department.

35:49.418 --> 35:49.618
Right.

35:49.638 --> 35:50.519
Take it from there.

35:51.340 --> 35:51.560
Yeah.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.221
And take it as a straight reporter.

35:53.241 --> 35:54.402
And they were all horrified.

35:54.883 --> 35:55.944
Everybody there was horrified.

35:55.964 --> 35:56.604
That's what they could be.

35:57.705 --> 35:58.346
They were horrified.

35:59.547 --> 36:00.888
And yet, it was possible to do it.

36:01.768 --> 36:05.051
So, I'm unfair in singling out of Georgetown then.

36:05.071 --> 36:06.092
You're unfair in singling.

36:06.528 --> 36:07.890
I think it's probably everywhere.

36:09.232 --> 36:23.355
Harold Bloom feels that departments of literature are going to be like departments of classics, you know, with two or three teachers and maybe a half a dozen kids taking literature and everything else will be cultural studies.

36:24.061 --> 36:28.246
I'm on a panel in Miami next month of the writing book there with David Dundee, the great book.

36:28.266 --> 36:30.149
Yeah, David, please say hello for me.

36:30.169 --> 36:36.637
I don't know if this is a person, and Alberto Mangualdo, The History of Reading, and Lynchian Schwartz, who's going to write it myself.

36:36.877 --> 36:37.778
It should be a heck of a fun panel.

36:37.798 --> 36:38.319
Sounds great.

36:38.379 --> 36:40.962
It should be a fun panel.

36:40.982 --> 36:41.823
Sounds like a great panel.

36:41.843 --> 36:45.207
It's going to be fun that I'm preparing for writing and reading all the books.

36:47.150 --> 36:51.756
But it's, so you know, I mean, I think you gave me an answer.

36:51.916 --> 36:52.937
I did give you an answer, yeah.

36:53.153 --> 37:02.162
I think it's just, I don't, I would not consider myself a well-read person if I hadn't read Shakespeare.

37:02.182 --> 37:08.048
I wouldn't consider myself a well-read person if I hadn't read Nome or Chaucer.

37:08.628 --> 37:21.861
And, you know, I'm not sure that I wouldn't rather know more African literature than Chaucer.

37:22.229 --> 37:25.853
I might be willing to make that trade, but I can't see Shakespeare.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.015
I just, I can't imagine.

37:28.115 --> 37:36.964
Or limiting your college exposure to one play, or four courses, whatever, as part of a sweeping survey for us.

37:36.984 --> 37:42.609
It's a very, that's a difficult proposition, but you just have to.

37:42.629 --> 37:49.536
Well, and maybe there's a corollary question to that, and this is where the criticism comes from, the women critics.

37:50.140 --> 38:00.135
and the African-American critics, and the multiculturalists, there are five different groups, and that literature has to be relevant to society.

38:00.175 --> 38:05.903
And that's the most, to me personally, that's a rather, is it relevant, I guess, is the question that is, is it relevant?

38:05.983 --> 38:07.646
They're absolutely right about that.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.248
Literature does have to be relevant.

38:09.268 --> 38:10.210
It doesn't have to be relevant.

38:10.230 --> 38:14.977
But you tell me why Shakespeare isn't relevant.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.220
Like, you know, I give this to you.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.021
It's great, I mean.

38:18.406 --> 38:48.025
My daughter is reading the first act of Hamlet, and so we got on the phone this morning, and we're talking about To Thy Own Self Be True, and I was telling her about watching Paul Scofield play Polonius, just the incredible blowhard that he is, and that, you know, and he just tosses off that line, To Thy Own Self Be True, and she says to me, and it's bullshit when he says it, and I said, no, I said, it's not bullshit, it's

38:48.325 --> 38:59.601
the magnificent irony of Shakespeare that from this incredibly unlikely source comes this truth to which human beings have resonated for 500 years.

38:59.761 --> 39:02.585
In his case, she's right, it's a platitude.

39:02.605 --> 39:04.367
When he utters it, it's a platitude.

39:04.387 --> 39:05.409
It means nothing to him.

39:05.569 --> 39:05.869
Right.

39:05.929 --> 39:06.670
He's molting it.

39:06.690 --> 39:07.271
That's the point.

39:07.552 --> 39:11.858
It means nothing to him, but to the rest of us, it lives forever.

39:11.878 --> 39:13.420
And it's extraordinary.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.042
It's above all else.

39:18.920 --> 39:26.947
I mean, he doesn't have the first idea of what that means, and yet, how is that not relevant to the experience that human beings have every day?

39:26.987 --> 39:35.075
I mean, we all deal with people who talk without listening to themselves.

39:35.155 --> 39:48.927
I mean, you just, it's such an astonishing, I mean, if you really think about that, that yes, he's a blowharder, no, he doesn't even understand what he's saying, and yet he's saying something of infinite value, it's like

39:49.480 --> 39:51.484
God, it's humanity complex.

39:51.504 --> 39:55.532
Yeah, but you know, rejected the sentiment, which is great, I think.

39:55.552 --> 39:58.297
Right, and so, and there you, I mean, how is that not wrong?

39:59.920 --> 40:00.361
It's a good quote.

40:01.123 --> 40:03.287
You know what, you're going to, when you describe a book
