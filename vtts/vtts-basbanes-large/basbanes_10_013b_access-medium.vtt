00:02.798 --> 00:07.364
What do you get out of a telephone book?

00:07.504 --> 00:09.507
Tell me.

00:09.547 --> 00:12.611
Demographics, population, where people live.

00:12.651 --> 00:14.854
Well, you've got the census records, too.

00:15.074 --> 00:18.799
There's a lot of things that I get out of them.

00:18.819 --> 00:18.920
What?

00:18.940 --> 00:21.183
The kinds of things we just described.

00:21.203 --> 00:29.634
But do you think that if you could preserve that basically, digitally, that that's just those preserving and copyright copying it?

00:30.535 --> 00:31.236
I don't know.

00:31.216 --> 00:41.755
I have not used phone books, and I can imagine that it's a pain that I have used city directories.

00:43.117 --> 00:43.578
Magnificent.

00:43.598 --> 00:46.002
Do you know them?

00:46.673 --> 01:06.994
And for me, my best use of city directories is to crack the dating of Samuel French Imprints, the play publisher, because the name of the firm changed.

01:08.459 --> 01:15.469
And it's nice to know that from, you know, 1845 to 1860 is called one thing and from 61 to 70.

01:15.589 --> 01:18.733
And the address changes.

01:18.893 --> 01:31.210
I played out the commercial directories in New York City and the street directories, the competing directories.

01:31.190 --> 01:48.627
and put an amalgam of data together to give you a way so that you, when you find a Samuel French imprint, you can look in my guide and you can see pretty much the three or four year period in which it was published.

01:48.647 --> 01:55.194
And obviously, if I were dealing with a 20th century publishing house, I could do that with telephone books.

01:56.415 --> 01:57.636
More likely,

01:57.616 --> 02:10.850
I would do that for people who are not registered in professional guides because the publishers get together and they make guides that help you.

02:10.870 --> 02:13.573
But what if I was interested in a plumber?

02:16.236 --> 02:26.627
I'd probably find him in the yellow books to say that, all right, from 1910 to 1921 in Newark, he ran a plumbing business.

02:26.607 --> 02:29.552
And I don't know where else I'd get that.

02:30.032 --> 02:32.917
Maybe, well, you know more about this because you work in City Hall.

02:34.639 --> 02:42.912
But that's for you to think you're a better judge of whether you need phone books year by year by year preserved somehow.

02:42.892 --> 02:44.334
or whether you don't.

02:44.394 --> 02:47.357
Well, we are running out of space.

02:47.377 --> 02:55.505
You know, the Library of Congress has 120 million items right now.

02:55.765 --> 03:00.210
They've got these three huge buildings in Washington, and now they're going out to Maryland.

03:00.230 --> 03:04.234
Well, how much space does the microfilm of a phone book take?

03:04.414 --> 03:05.856
Well, we're talking microfilm now.

03:05.916 --> 03:09.760
Can you get a whole phone book and a single reel?

03:10.246 --> 03:11.228
I don't know.

03:11.248 --> 03:13.012
On real, I think it's digitized.

03:13.172 --> 03:17.061
Microfilm is, it's all going to be digitized, I think.

03:17.241 --> 03:18.664
On what?

03:18.705 --> 03:19.486
What's the material?

03:20.348 --> 03:21.711
Microchairs.

03:23.315 --> 03:25.740
But they're embedded in something.

03:26.902 --> 03:56.908
they're not floating in space it's like those images from the printing types that's embedded in something you know it's made out of hemp and rags and it's lasting pretty good that's the word i'm writing down now and then it then it got embedded in something that uh cannot last i asked that same question to the woman at cornell and what she said is i can't tell you what what the substance will be she said it is up to us you're incumbent upon us to ensure the migration that's the word they use the migration of the data

03:56.888 --> 03:59.980
from one substance to the next.

04:00.989 --> 04:27.098
because it's always zeros and ones regardless of whether it's on a magnetic tape or whatever but what's it on now all right now how long do they last i don't know well that's the question you see how long the question is is the whole thing and will somebody be there to ensure that the migration takes place

04:27.078 --> 04:52.697
you know at a certain point we had a lot of data on magnetic tape remember that yep we had sensors for instance data and nobody can access it now on magnetic tape now we know first off if you get too close to an electromagnetic source you lose the tape there's nothing there that's right

04:52.677 --> 05:03.953
On the other hand, I remember being told if you don't play them somehow once a year, exercise them, you lose them.

05:03.993 --> 05:16.491
Now, if you're in a library with, let's say, 100,000 reels of magnetic tape, what's the amount of energy required for you to play them

05:16.471 --> 05:19.839
to the extent that they retain their viability every year.

05:21.142 --> 05:29.422
And when they say, now we're giving you another 400,000 tapes next year, is it still okay?

05:29.462 --> 05:30.565
Can you still play them?

05:31.270 --> 05:37.238
or touch them or wand them or something, whatever it is, to keep them viable.

05:37.458 --> 05:44.768
And these are questions we never thought about until when?

05:44.828 --> 05:47.792
When did we think about these?

05:47.812 --> 05:48.753
The next 10 years.

05:48.953 --> 05:50.275
Something like that.

05:50.255 --> 06:00.671
When I think about William Jackson dying in 64, I don't think he ever saw a slow fire.

06:04.017 --> 06:09.445
You know what I mean?

06:09.425 --> 06:12.212
What do you mean by that?

06:12.232 --> 06:13.394
Well, you never saw a chipped book.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.166
I don't think the bad paper had begun to go.

06:19.369 --> 06:20.932
I don't think we saw that then.

06:22.516 --> 06:27.889
And I think I've told you before, I remember going to Paris and looking at these walls of Yellowback novels.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.539
when I first began to shop books in Paris.

06:30.559 --> 06:31.280
Oh, it was fine.

06:32.081 --> 06:32.801
They weren't brown.

06:33.662 --> 06:35.965
They weren't flaking.

06:35.985 --> 06:36.705
And now they're gone.

06:37.106 --> 06:43.972
You know, the shops that are still in existence that had those walls of yellow paperbacks are selling other things.

06:43.992 --> 06:49.098
They're selling illustrated books, or they're all grand papier, you know, they're all on good paper.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.703
But it's just very recently that the whole thing has come down on us.

06:56.422 --> 07:00.974
And that's a lesson for a media exchange, isn't it?

07:04.845 --> 07:11.764
Can we bank on another material only to find that suddenly in a 10-year period it goes bad?

07:11.744 --> 07:18.937
Well, we can test that out these days, you know.

07:20.319 --> 07:25.007
We can test out material.

07:25.027 --> 07:32.400
Well, this is none of my business, and a whole bunch of chemists know all about these things, and I know nothing about them.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.123
All I know is the basic...

07:34.677 --> 07:49.757
The basic issue of it is if you're converting one A to B, how durable is A and how durable is B?

07:49.877 --> 07:54.624
The NEH, I think, came down on film always, always, always film.

07:54.744 --> 07:59.971
That would be interesting.

08:00.672 --> 08:02.254
Would the NEH give you a grant...

08:02.825 --> 08:05.789
for anything other than microfilm preservation these days?

08:05.809 --> 08:08.032
Anything other than?

08:08.052 --> 08:08.652
That's a test.

08:09.473 --> 08:16.002
You know, these guys are not smart.

08:17.283 --> 08:24.352
Do they accept other containers for conversion in funding?

08:24.372 --> 08:28.798
Oh, I think they're really setting up these national digital libraries in there.

08:29.159 --> 08:30.300
Denny H?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.926
They're involved, probably.

08:32.086 --> 08:36.019
You can do a search of... They put money into it just to see what happens.

08:36.059 --> 08:37.926
Well, to what extent are they involved?

08:38.146 --> 08:41.337
They gave everything to microfilm conversion.

08:42.127 --> 09:00.625
i don't know five years ago or something like that they're making these multi-million dollar grants to single places remember i never finished what i was saying when the guy at cornell told me that they raised more money than harvard and then i said well then that's all the more reason for you then to preserve you've got the money to do it

09:00.605 --> 09:03.229
He said, well, our money isn't inherited like theirs.

09:03.249 --> 09:05.012
He said, we have to go out and get it every year.

09:05.693 --> 09:10.641
Meaning, all the money they get are from people like Eastman Kodak, Xerox.

09:11.062 --> 09:14.768
Now, you see, it really... Well, they're getting cash.

09:15.009 --> 09:18.014
It behooves them to do the kinds of things that they're doing.

09:18.214 --> 09:20.498
They're getting cash, and we always go for endowment.

09:20.758 --> 09:21.159
That's right.

09:21.199 --> 09:26.848
You know, everything around me says...

09:27.520 --> 09:52.819
when i'm sent to you uh for fundraising um get an endowment don't uh take cash to do something they're not as interested in my getting uh five thousand dollars from you to buy a book as they are in my getting twenty five thousand dollars from you for a for a an endowment

09:52.799 --> 10:03.131
for whatever purpose, so that, as Cornell says, the money here is inherited.

10:03.392 --> 10:14.605
And, you know, Nick, when he established his $50,000 fund, said, this is restricted to the purchase of Swedish...

10:14.585 --> 10:39.141
literature and book arts uh before um the year 2000 you know so forever we expend twenty five hundred dollars or whatever it is a year on that subject and we have an internal audit comes you know wants it all to roger and says you know we have this best bands fund let's see what you've been doing with it

10:39.796 --> 10:52.472
and i better not show them you know german or italian i better show them you know that it's swedish and that it's a particular kind of swedish or i get in trouble with my

10:53.060 --> 10:54.482
My internal audit.

10:54.502 --> 10:59.888
This is not coming from my bosses up the hierarchy, but this is all over the place.

11:01.110 --> 11:10.161
So that the internal audit can go to you as dean of Harvard College and say, you know, you have this fund for Nigerian students.

11:10.662 --> 11:15.608
I want to see the names of these Nigerian students that have benefited from your fund.

11:15.588 --> 11:32.209
And you ought to go from one to the other, you know.

11:32.829 --> 11:33.831
Well, you know about this.

11:33.951 --> 11:34.551
I do.

11:34.612 --> 11:38.817
I usually try to cross and see what one will tell you about another.

11:38.837 --> 11:39.438
Oh, of course.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.460
That's the great point.

11:41.677 --> 11:47.005
And I can't tell you the state of health of Lucien Chalier.

11:48.787 --> 11:53.514
Pierre Beres is going to see me when I go to Paris, so I think he's going to be okay.

11:53.915 --> 11:56.899
Now, did you call him, or how did you communicate with him?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.924
Well, I fax to these people to make appointments.

11:59.944 --> 12:02.908
You know, I fill the days with people in the same neighborhood and all that.

12:02.888 --> 12:30.752
you know see how many i can nail down and i go fishing for people and asking them if they have anything to show me or not uh whether i should bother with them or not you're still looking he's going to see me he's going to see me but you're still looking that's the idea of these this journey from uh lugano and milano and and paris and and london just kind of out there with your eyes and ears open

12:30.732 --> 12:34.619
I have French books.

12:34.699 --> 12:35.581
Oh, that's optimistic.

12:35.621 --> 12:36.543
I don't remember that.

12:37.604 --> 12:38.666
Remember you said it.

12:38.727 --> 12:43.896
Yeah, I'll never get it.

12:43.936 --> 12:45.218
Some science books.

12:49.105 --> 12:53.854
It's more opportunism than not because...

12:53.834 --> 13:01.564
You know, if you started making desiderato lists, there'd be 10,000 books here and 10,000 books there, and you can't manage that.

13:02.325 --> 13:03.706
That's more instinctive, I guess.

13:03.967 --> 13:12.217
I've had very good luck in knocking off short desiderato lists.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.603
Very good luck.

13:16.623 --> 13:17.244
Very good luck.

13:17.864 --> 13:21.529
Richard Landon says that you are recruited to be one of the two or three

13:22.083 --> 13:25.247
It's quite horrible.

13:26.048 --> 13:29.213
You know, it's quite horrible.

13:31.296 --> 13:32.678
You know the name Stephen Weissman?

13:33.258 --> 13:35.341
I interviewed him in London last month.

13:36.423 --> 13:39.267
He just bought a new house.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.571
Yes, I hope to see it outside Bath.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.402
He was the principal...

13:50.922 --> 13:53.777
specialist dealer in English literature in New York City.

13:55.124 --> 13:56.025
which is saying a lot.

13:59.450 --> 14:04.456
And he admitted at one point to Marcus and to me.

14:04.516 --> 14:05.578
Do you keep in touch with Marcus?

14:05.878 --> 14:06.379
I do.

14:06.599 --> 14:07.340
He's hip, you know.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.243
He's hip, you know.

14:09.563 --> 14:12.387
I know that.

14:12.567 --> 14:17.373
He admitted to me and Marcus years ago that we were the only two booksellers calling on him.

14:18.134 --> 14:20.838
We were the only two librarians calling on him.

14:20.858 --> 14:22.520
That's amazing.

14:22.540 --> 14:23.241
It's horrible.

14:24.318 --> 14:26.704
It's horrible.

14:26.824 --> 14:31.736
Because at a certain point, you couldn't really build an English literature collection in this country without him.

14:32.478 --> 14:34.342
He needed his help.

14:35.244 --> 14:40.858
Unless you were horsing around, you know, and fooling people.

14:41.277 --> 15:03.943
um because he's got the books i mean you're not going to find some other dealer in new york city who's got better books than he and english literature and a lot of the american imprints too he was uh you know we used to go to seven gables bookshop to michael papantonio and john s van e cohen you know those names and they were the great ones

15:03.923 --> 15:11.895
At a certain point, you couldn't keep building your American literature collection or English literature collection without them.

15:12.857 --> 15:14.319
You had relations with them or you didn't.

15:14.639 --> 15:15.821
If you didn't, you're fooling people.

15:15.941 --> 15:18.165
You're not doing the job.

15:20.228 --> 15:31.365
It's a comment about the libraries in our country that people didn't go to New York to meet Wiseman and get books from them.

15:31.345 --> 15:32.707
It's horrible.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.234
How do you keep up a book collection?

15:38.156 --> 15:44.666
Well, they're not doing the job.

15:44.706 --> 15:48.492
They're not doing the job.

15:48.512 --> 15:49.874
They're not building up collections.

15:49.894 --> 15:52.358
They may be building up copycat collections.

15:52.338 --> 15:57.944
There are a lot of collections you can build up without much effort.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.986
I mean, they claim they're absorbing what they have.

16:00.646 --> 16:09.175
That's kind of an easy way of saying we're not spending any more money on special collections.

16:09.195 --> 16:18.885
We were talking for some reason or other about slowing down the process of choosing acquisitions yesterday, and I was thinking,

16:18.865 --> 16:24.991
Wednesday, Tuesday afternoon, the late mail, I got a catalog, an advanced catalog from a dealer outside London.

16:25.011 --> 16:39.626
I read it that night, and beginning at 7.30 that morning, I checked it and telephoned a few minutes later, and I lost my book.

16:43.730 --> 16:47.033
So I'm interested in how we can speed up this process.

16:47.013 --> 16:49.219
I'm getting orders out.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.242
Because then we get books.

16:50.382 --> 16:55.475
You know, when the National Library of Scotland beats me for a book, that hurts me.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.183
You know, that hurts me.

17:01.090 --> 17:03.216
Can you remember what the book was?

17:04.006 --> 17:06.790
is a German hum.

17:06.810 --> 17:14.461
And it's one thing I've been buying is German translations of British literature.

17:14.481 --> 17:16.785
And you can't get better than a philosophy.

17:16.805 --> 17:23.955
You know, philosophy and poetry and fiction, you know, really hurts me.

17:24.056 --> 17:27.941
Really hurts me.

17:28.182 --> 17:31.887
Much upon a time, I think the silver case at Harvard,

17:32.035 --> 17:41.365
that you were almost, the reputation, the stature of an institution was almost commensurate with the size of its library holdings.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.588
Do you think that's still the case today?

17:43.908 --> 17:48.493
Where you would say, how many books did such as an institution borrow?

17:48.553 --> 17:52.858
It's like five million books, ten million books, or a million books.

17:52.998 --> 17:56.862
That prestige is almost synonymous with the size of a collection.

17:57.128 --> 17:58.850
Maybe you don't agree with that.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.432
I wonder if that's still the case.

18:01.452 --> 18:04.995
Well, Soviets certainly saw it that way, didn't they?

18:05.155 --> 18:10.580
You know, the book statistics from Soviet libraries and all the Americans scratching their head.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.483
You know, they're counting every volume in the set.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.126
Or do they count the set as one volume?

18:17.146 --> 18:20.329
Are they adding the microfilms to that?

18:20.349 --> 18:22.311
How do they come up with these immense numbers?

18:22.331 --> 18:25.093
You know, there's so many times...

18:25.327 --> 18:33.883
The books in the Library of Congress, in the Lenin Library, you know, how is this possible?

18:33.903 --> 18:38.231
So obviously we went through that phase.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.798
You can't do it without numbers, can you?

18:41.818 --> 18:46.086
I mean, you can't say there are 10,000 books in this library and they're the best.

18:46.066 --> 18:50.614
10,000 books in the world for teaching and research.

18:52.057 --> 18:57.006
Well, some people say that one goes hand in hand with the other.

18:57.046 --> 19:03.457
If you have an excellent institution, then you're going to have an excellent library, I guess.

19:03.758 --> 19:04.579
Not necessarily.

19:04.660 --> 19:10.470
I mean, I think it matters to Harvard that it has artists.

19:10.771 --> 19:23.430
It wasn't until about five years ago that I learned something specific about the Stanford Library.

19:23.630 --> 19:38.310
I had judged them on the basis of their collection of opera manuscripts, which makes a volume, you know, an inch and a half thick volume describing that collection of Italian opera manuscripts.

19:38.390 --> 19:43.056
It's very interesting.

19:43.036 --> 19:45.138
But they don't have any books.

19:45.319 --> 19:46.540
They don't have any books.

19:46.901 --> 19:47.742
There are no books there.

19:49.343 --> 19:56.212
And they were buying specimens, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, which is what you and I would do if we went there and we wanted to do some teaching with books.

19:56.232 --> 20:05.743
We would say, you know, we want a few incanabula and some STC books, and we want some Italian humanism and some German philosophy, you know.

20:05.763 --> 20:10.849
So when we sit around the seminar room, we have something to show of different cultures and different genres.

20:11.842 --> 20:14.267
And that's what they've done there until they got the Ginsburg.

20:15.450 --> 20:19.058
Aren't there the ones that got the Ginsburg?

20:20.982 --> 20:22.846
And I still don't understand.

20:22.866 --> 20:24.349
I mean, it's the Harvard of the West.

20:24.869 --> 20:27.914
And there's no library.

20:29.977 --> 20:32.961
Mike Keller is the special collections guy.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.043
I interviewed him.

20:34.864 --> 20:37.168
Their attitude is wired.

20:37.188 --> 20:39.732
They are totally wired up libraries.

20:39.752 --> 20:42.075
Yeah, but we've only been wired for 10 years or so.

20:42.156 --> 20:42.957
20 years.

20:42.977 --> 20:45.981
I mean, 20 years ago, they had no books.

20:46.001 --> 20:47.704
50 years ago, they had no books.

20:48.173 --> 20:50.556
and they were still at Harvard of the West 50 years ago.

20:50.656 --> 20:57.683
Well, the Stanford University Press is actually publishing books online, on paper.

20:57.703 --> 20:58.784
Well, I don't know about the press.

20:58.824 --> 21:03.970
I'm just talking about the university and the library of resources.

21:04.530 --> 21:13.059
You know, to say, all right, we didn't have any books until 1930, and then we got this microfilm machine, and now we've got all these microphones.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.521
That's fine.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.404
But they never had any books before 1930.

21:17.654 --> 21:19.017
And it's extraordinary.

21:20.499 --> 21:26.431
You see, UCLA has books and Berkeley has books, but somehow Stanford has no books.

21:26.551 --> 21:26.872
Why?

21:27.112 --> 21:27.593
Why is that?

21:27.633 --> 21:35.308
I think that, you know, people used to say about Harrison Horvath, it's interesting to know when a collector stops collecting.

21:35.997 --> 21:37.899
Why did Harrison stop?

21:38.099 --> 21:38.980
Do you have a theory?

21:39.441 --> 21:39.681
No.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.664
Why does Stanford never begin?

21:42.684 --> 21:43.866
I have no idea.

21:43.966 --> 21:47.810
I know nothing about the place except that I've always thought it's the Harvard of the West.

21:48.471 --> 21:54.738
And what it is is a triumph of publicity over fact, I guess.

21:55.579 --> 21:59.883
Or somehow they're able to teach courses without books.

21:59.923 --> 22:00.304
I don't know.

22:00.344 --> 22:02.446
Are you talking about in terms of numbers?

22:02.526 --> 22:03.287
Numbers.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.129
Numbers, actual numbers.

22:05.209 --> 22:05.629
Numbers.

22:06.230 --> 22:06.751
Good books.

22:07.331 --> 22:10.935
Value, you know, historical value in research collections.

22:11.035 --> 22:11.916
They're not there.

22:14.599 --> 22:15.400
So it's just fluky.

22:15.420 --> 22:19.864
They've got the Hoover, you know, for what the Hoover does, and they've got these opera manuscripts.

22:19.944 --> 22:24.709
But they have no rare books and manuscripts in the main library.

22:25.590 --> 22:27.132
It's a funny business.

22:29.525 --> 22:31.146
Chicago is another funny place.

22:32.388 --> 22:39.774
For some reason, and you will see this more clearly than we will, because we're looking inside and you're looking all over.

22:40.375 --> 22:43.958
Something happened, you know, in the Coolidge time, and it stuck.

22:44.979 --> 22:56.449
The spirit was here before, because way back in 1818, they bought this Abeling collection of Americana, you know, for Harvard.

22:56.729 --> 22:59.532
And that was strictly a research collection.

22:59.512 --> 23:05.940
about 7,000 maps, you know, and all those American newspapers.

23:06.340 --> 23:09.584
It was incredible.

23:10.465 --> 23:11.927
I thought it was long.

23:13.569 --> 23:21.418
You've read the Harvard Library literature, you know, they bought a few early manuscripts early in the 19th century, and then a long hiatus in the 1840s, and they bought this.

23:21.702 --> 23:41.331
astronomy collection in in germany you know they got a lot of science in the middle of the 1840s and then oh something inspired and then uh it went into the 1880s and they bought romances in in italian french you know spanish and then kludge came and he got it together

23:41.817 --> 23:52.112
The view of a library that should have a German part, an Italian part, and a Russian part, and, you know.

23:52.292 --> 23:53.013
And that stuck.

23:54.055 --> 23:59.042
And it went just fine until he died, and it went into abeyance, and Ty's Metcalfe came back.

23:59.122 --> 24:01.665
It was a bad five years.

24:01.706 --> 24:04.129
It was after the Winship time and after the Coolidge time.

24:05.358 --> 24:22.742
nothing happened nothing happened and then they got ties in and ties recruited uh hofer and jackson and uh they did more probably for the for the coolidge program than the widener book selectors were doing

24:23.127 --> 24:23.868
peaking that.

24:24.489 --> 24:30.417
Just imagine what Hofer and Jackson did to this great library that Coolidge had begun.

24:30.457 --> 24:37.547
Is Anthony Grafton up here yet?

24:37.607 --> 24:41.592
He is a Dibner fellow.

24:41.572 --> 24:42.474
semester.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.619
He should have been here already.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.023
He should be here now.

24:46.043 --> 24:48.087
He should have been here already.

24:48.128 --> 24:49.651
He should be finishing up already.

24:49.671 --> 24:51.215
And I haven't seen him.

24:51.796 --> 24:52.739
I thought it was spring term.

24:52.779 --> 24:53.460
Maybe I'm wrong.

24:53.540 --> 24:57.430
I remember you said in your comments in New York that he was coming up with spring term.

24:57.610 --> 24:58.011
No, no.

24:57.991 --> 25:00.956
And I think I talked to him afterwards, and he said he's coming up.

25:01.497 --> 25:04.943
And I said, I want to do an interview either here or there.

25:05.323 --> 25:05.924
Yes, you should.

25:06.465 --> 25:07.246
I'd like to do it here.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.270
You heard his paper in New York.

25:09.410 --> 25:10.211
I love it.

25:10.231 --> 25:10.912
It's incredible.

25:11.273 --> 25:12.154
Are you publishing that?

25:12.495 --> 25:12.856
Of course.

25:12.936 --> 25:13.897
It'll go in the papers.

25:14.018 --> 25:15.420
I don't know.

25:16.201 --> 25:17.604
That's the editor's business.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.607
I did my best.

25:19.827 --> 25:22.692
I don't know if I can wait.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.555
I did my best.

25:24.535 --> 25:49.429
for instance those those papers that you had last week clearly aren't cheap that'll take about a year to be published don't you think well i don't usually take that long that's fit so i'm trying to get some pictures and i want to choose the best you know like 10 pictures and choose the best five or something like that and it's a list of students and there's a problem with that because

25:49.848 --> 25:56.896
There's a missing year or two from the list that we've got so far, and Michael has some ideas about finishing it up.

25:56.976 --> 25:57.757
It'll be incredible.

25:57.897 --> 26:00.100
It'll just be incredible.

26:00.260 --> 26:05.706
So we have a list of students, three papers, and some pictures.

26:05.766 --> 26:07.628
And I think we let it go with that.

26:08.249 --> 26:16.058
There's a long list of publications of Winship that Tom Adams' dad printed at the Clements, and I haven't seen it.

26:16.240 --> 26:37.152
somebody will prompt me and i'll have a look at that that would wreck it let me just bury everything else if at some point over the next six months you don't have this in the in the publishing process look i have two of the three papers the third paper michael i will get momentarily i have the student list and

26:37.132 --> 26:54.195
i need a recipe for completing it and uh if i don't have this out in october i don't know i should kill myself uh because uh

26:54.175 --> 26:57.118
Can I get copies of these papers?

26:57.138 --> 26:57.899
Well, that's up to them.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.101
I already asked them.

26:59.121 --> 26:59.841
They said it's mine.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.986
You use their papers with their permission and not mine.

27:04.327 --> 27:09.512
And they should come out on short order.

27:09.532 --> 27:17.041
I'm just sorry about that issue of the PBSA that I really should be sending off to them now.

27:17.061 --> 27:17.922
And I haven't...

27:17.902 --> 27:33.295
Now,

27:33.275 --> 27:36.619
You know, there's one criticism of your book.

27:37.800 --> 27:38.261
That's all?

27:39.242 --> 27:50.516
That, well, there's a bunch of malarkey, and I can imagine the kind of thing... ...carsership and not relic.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.097
You know?

27:51.117 --> 27:56.363
But do you have a sense of what makes the book exciting?

27:56.343 --> 27:57.886
You haven't had sense.

27:58.186 --> 28:00.931
Well, maybe I do, but do you see what I mean?

28:01.111 --> 28:14.114
The anxiety gives us a sense of that in my book when he describes the Guggenberg Bible, for instance, of the Lickling homony.

28:14.154 --> 28:17.760
How the lake describes it when he picks up something and he...

28:18.010 --> 28:34.720
But the farther away it is from relics, the more difficult it is to understand.

28:35.425 --> 28:42.799
Well, I don't know if it is or not.

28:42.859 --> 28:54.761
It's the level at which it is useful for understanding a whole community of commerce and client.

28:56.905 --> 28:58.648
Because

28:58.628 --> 29:18.153
From the moment the scriptoria were producing books for the head of the order or the monarch or something like that, you know, it existed.

29:19.895 --> 29:22.718
You know what I mean?

29:22.738 --> 29:26.323
And it comes into printing and by the time printing exists, you know, there are people who are

29:27.434 --> 29:37.056
choosing the vellum copy over the paper copy and people who are um well so far they said getting the finest

29:37.289 --> 29:45.742
to draw the pictures in the printed book.

29:45.762 --> 30:00.283
I was thinking of this the other day when I had... You've probably been reading some stuff by Nicholas Pickwode, played by Nier.

30:00.664 --> 30:04.309
And I had this book that...

30:05.960 --> 30:26.162
has a piece of vellum, a short piece of vellum, you know, maybe an inch over the edge, stabbed, you know, and then somebody had wrapped a vellum wrapper around the whole thing and hadn't gone to the extent of having it taken apart and re-sewn or anything like that.

30:26.283 --> 30:35.713
It's the cheapest binding that you could manage as a bookseller to keep the sheets together and then sell them to me.

30:36.605 --> 30:39.149
And I'm your most impecunious customer.

30:39.189 --> 30:52.788
Instead of saying, you know, the binder, take it apart and put it in Morocco, I'm saying, you know, I'd like the cheapest relative wrapper that you could please put on there, sir, and don't take anything apart that my bookseller friend put together.

30:52.828 --> 31:02.241
He's on this bottom end of the scale, which is so fascinating, in part because so little evidence remains of it.

31:02.542 --> 31:03.964
Every bit of evidence counts.

31:10.010 --> 31:22.344
And coming out today, you know, what is it today that makes a book interesting, exciting to someone?

31:22.484 --> 31:25.287
And exciting within a kind of community.

31:26.288 --> 31:31.013
You know, it's not like

31:31.415 --> 31:33.117
It's not that one person is excited.

31:33.758 --> 31:36.923
The connoisseurship, I think, you would expect is a community.

31:37.664 --> 31:46.457
So that in Bruges in 1470, a whole community of people would say, ah, yes, he is the greatest illuminator that we have.

31:46.557 --> 31:48.600
Does it have to be physically beautiful?

31:48.640 --> 31:51.685
The context of the book.

31:51.745 --> 31:55.650
Does it have to have these exclusive lists?

31:55.670 --> 32:00.257
Well, then you're getting back to relics, you see.

32:00.406 --> 32:02.008
And that's easier to understand.

32:04.011 --> 32:08.437
George Washington sat in his chair and Napoleon owned this copy.

32:09.698 --> 32:11.881
Hemingway inscribed this book.

32:12.081 --> 32:15.926
It's relics.

32:16.788 --> 32:19.731
And that's really the easiest to understand.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.515
Easiest to understand.

32:22.664 --> 32:30.597
In my weird way, I bought a whole box of Black Panther Party immeographica.

32:30.617 --> 32:32.404
You know, they were running a counter press.

32:32.890 --> 33:01.868
during all the trials but their counter press you know they had no money and you can literally watch these the chips come off this i don't handle them anymore uh in my weird way i've found the money to buy this and i'm waiting now for somebody who will one time handle them in microphone so i can put them away again this is a really weird kind of connoisseurship involved there

33:02.152 --> 33:03.371
Nobody owns them.

33:03.738 --> 33:09.805
and nobody sold them, and if you want to replicate this box, I mean, good luck.

33:09.825 --> 33:14.671
I mean, offer rewards of $25,000 or something.

33:15.392 --> 33:16.893
Do you acquire these for the whole library?

33:16.913 --> 33:29.748
Yeah, I've got them in the vault because I'm still waiting to solve the problem of getting a microfilm because they can't be, you know, if you and I went through them and kept notes, that would be the end.

33:29.848 --> 33:32.952
I mean, it would be chips, like cornflakes.

33:32.932 --> 33:46.553
you know so what what uh persuaded you to get those just what do you think wow do you have a career the other copies are all cornflakes i mean who's got them

33:46.668 --> 33:53.456
Does it support any other collection that you have in the same... Well, if you're interested, I don't know, there's black people in this country or something like that.

34:00.504 --> 34:09.995
What was, for many people, a horrifying period in living in this country because of the shenanigans of these panthers.

34:10.015 --> 34:16.422
And on the other side was manna to a lot of inner city, you know, the whole business.

34:17.380 --> 34:20.367
So this stuff is in the vault because it's falling apart.

34:21.209 --> 34:24.096
Because it's going to fall apart if I don't find a way to.

34:24.116 --> 34:28.808
So what if I'm a scholar doing something on this right now and I say, Roger, I'd like to see this stuff.

34:28.988 --> 34:34.782
Well, maybe you'd like to help me to find a way so that you could do that.

34:34.762 --> 34:36.404
But I'm not going to give you the box.

34:39.847 --> 34:58.484
Maybe between us, we'll find a way to make some money and find somebody who will do it one time and put it back in the vault and you'll have this impeccable film from which you can make prints with which you can teach your class or whatever you want to do.

34:58.604 --> 35:02.608
But if I don't behave properly, nobody's going to have it.

35:02.892 --> 35:03.813
in a year.

35:03.994 --> 35:04.274
You see?

35:04.775 --> 35:05.095
You see?

35:07.238 --> 35:12.747
And this reminds me of, you know, Peter Howard at Serendipity?

35:13.868 --> 35:28.470
Who is the guy who, what is his name, who made that geodesic... Huffminster Fuller.

35:29.351 --> 35:31.414
Well, his first stuff is Mimeographica.

35:32.440 --> 35:37.905
30s mimeograph with drawings on it and all that.

35:38.125 --> 35:41.468
And Peter had one of these in the Boston Book Fair.

35:41.488 --> 35:47.313
And I thought, oh, my God.

35:47.493 --> 35:50.235
Why would I get involved in that?

35:50.295 --> 35:54.659
And I would know what I would get involved in.

35:54.679 --> 35:56.140
And I said, Peter, all right, save that.

35:56.180 --> 35:57.061
I'm going to look into this.

35:57.101 --> 35:59.403
And I found, damn it, that somebody made a facsimile.

35:59.483 --> 36:01.485
Bless them, some foundation made a facsimile.

36:02.123 --> 36:23.412
But if nobody had, I probably would have taken that on with the idea of disassembling that volume and getting the best possible print off every surface of that and putting as much of it as I could back in a box in the vault.

36:23.432 --> 36:29.700
And bless them, I can't tell you the name of it, but if you look up in the records, you'd find that some foundation has done that.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.212
Save them.

36:32.232 --> 36:36.018
That's the only... So the only way to save it is to disassemble it.

36:36.659 --> 36:46.556
And get the best, you know, you know how it is with a bound book, suddenly, sometimes when you open the book, the leaves go like that.

36:46.576 --> 36:48.218
That's exactly what you're saying.

36:48.238 --> 36:51.644
And you can't get a viable image out of that.

36:51.664 --> 36:56.532
And that's why, in the old days, a lot of people guillotined, you know, the spine.

36:57.170 --> 37:23.633
rendering the book into loose leaves and then they pass these leaves under the camera so you get an absolute in focus picture of every surface let me tell you what i saw when i went to cornell looking and it's not like i'm targeting cornell it's just they are doing some interesting things i've got this unit up there with six machines where they're scanning books and you go in and they're all old books nothing nothing more recent than 19th century because there's no copyright problem in it

37:23.950 --> 37:49.671
Well, that is an issue, you know, if you're going to do it one time,

37:49.955 --> 37:59.222
You don't want to do it so the upper right quadrant of every page is illegible, you know.

37:59.303 --> 38:21.396
and that's why in the old days of microfilming i'll never forget some they took a classic work out of widener stack a classic work of aesthetic criticism and it came back guillotined and i said who gave them the permission to do that and they said well nobody did and i said all right we're going to buy another copy of this book and charge them for it and then

38:21.376 --> 38:22.700
You know, I was lucky.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.131
I got for $300 or $400 a copy of this book, and we got it back again.

38:26.592 --> 38:30.424
I remember another book, and I'm so sorry I didn't save it.

38:30.691 --> 38:34.798
It was shown to me by the Fine Arts Librarian.

38:35.720 --> 38:44.035
Somebody had gone through with whiteout and corrected all the punctuation in this book.

38:45.037 --> 38:53.712
And I should have said, you know, would you let me please have that in the Houghton Library because I'd like to preserve this.

38:53.692 --> 39:10.544
as a specimen of that moment of where we were in the re, it's not reconfiguration, it's the re, what is it, the replay, the re, what do you mean, reconning, recon, whatever, of documents.

39:10.564 --> 39:16.155
And this was the good time for the offset reprint publishing enterprise, you know.

39:16.962 --> 39:24.096
when a lot of community colleges were becoming colleges and colleges were becoming universities and all that.

39:24.116 --> 39:26.801
There was a need, a sudden need, for a lot of books that weren't there.

39:27.763 --> 39:31.410
And that's where Carlos Reaprain and others came in.

39:32.740 --> 39:38.012
And places like Harvard have the books to supply for the camera work.

39:38.032 --> 39:40.477
Well, you know, they have an industry going at the University of Toronto.

39:40.517 --> 39:46.511
The Japanese, whenever they want a book that they can't buy, they'll go to Toronto, and Toronto will digitize it.

39:46.571 --> 39:48.235
But they want a hired copy.

39:48.255 --> 39:51.542
And they'll

39:51.522 --> 40:14.813
digitize it make a hard copy and uh and for some reason the japanese want a hard reprinted copy of it and they'll cut up i don't know if they'll cut up their own book but apparently that they have a an industry going in toronto with the japanese libraries they really want hard copies even if they're not original and didn't what's the kids book collection up there

40:14.793 --> 40:19.040
And in Canada, the Osborne collection.

40:19.180 --> 40:23.707
That's the public library, the Osborne collection, magnificent.

40:23.727 --> 40:27.653
Because they have a deal with Japanese, too, and they've made sets.

40:27.773 --> 40:32.260
They've chosen 20 English children's books with color.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.041
That's right.

40:33.142 --> 40:35.966
And produced absolute facsimiles.

40:35.986 --> 40:37.168
Gorgeous looking.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.650
I like the looks of them.

40:38.670 --> 40:38.770
Yeah.

40:38.790 --> 40:40.513
Very interesting how things are those.

40:40.882 --> 40:42.625
Well, what do you think?

40:42.665 --> 40:48.635
Well, I mean, it's the endless terrain.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.137
Does it sound like an interesting project?

40:50.277 --> 40:58.010
Endless terrain, but I'm still hoping that you come to grips with this, with Mr. Hitler.

40:58.090 --> 40:59.473
That's the second chapter.

41:00.374 --> 41:05.843
I'm still hoping that you meet some key people before they're gone.

41:06.042 --> 41:14.213
Lucien you mentioned where they're going not Lucien but Lucien Schiller Who else would you like?

41:15.274 --> 41:20.601
And Birez and Romer mentions two people in Amsterdam booksellers.

41:20.621 --> 41:22.023
You don't remember them?

41:22.043 --> 41:23.104
I haven't remember them.

41:23.184 --> 41:23.965
One would be Nikko.

41:24.185 --> 41:24.666
Exactly.

41:24.686 --> 41:27.730
Nikko Israel and

41:27.710 --> 41:31.537
I assume he's a Jew.

41:31.577 --> 41:35.164
And seems to think he's very important for me to see.

41:35.184 --> 41:36.166
I assume he's a Jew.

41:36.627 --> 41:41.256
And I have the slightest idea of what he did during the occupation.

41:43.299 --> 41:49.431
You know, it was possible to hide out in the Netherlands without being...

41:49.715 --> 42:14.220
being discovered you know it was possible well she lasted a long time i mean that was going on i mean she's not the only one who was hidden and uh she may be um among the few who were discovered i don't know well she was never turned in too so it's yeah but but uh i don't know where it was

42:14.200 --> 42:15.624
But I assume he's Jewish.

42:15.644 --> 42:17.008
I've never asked him about this.

42:18.030 --> 42:22.202
I called on him last year on my way down.

42:22.362 --> 42:23.425
I started in Amsterdam.

42:23.445 --> 42:28.318
I began by calling on him and delivering to him George Goodsby's books.

42:28.378 --> 42:30.083
I said, this is...

42:30.721 --> 42:32.063
It's not a gift, it's a project.

42:32.463 --> 42:35.026
And it's time for you to write it.

42:35.327 --> 42:37.249
Write your reminiscences.

42:37.670 --> 42:38.331
He's retired.

42:38.371 --> 42:39.512
He's not in the shop anymore.

42:39.532 --> 42:40.573
No, that's exactly what you said.

42:41.575 --> 42:42.035
He's not in the shop.

42:42.055 --> 42:45.900
Actually, he published a book on the Nuremberg Chronicle, which I picked up at the New York Fair.

42:46.120 --> 42:46.921
That's a lovely book.

42:47.222 --> 42:51.607
That's by those San Francisco folks.

42:51.848 --> 42:53.550
I paid $110 for it.

42:53.670 --> 42:54.371
Too much.

42:54.391 --> 42:55.792
You paid too much.

42:55.812 --> 42:57.094
Well, where was I going to find it?

42:57.114 --> 42:57.875
Well, I don't know.

42:57.895 --> 42:58.956
Keep shopping.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.238
But I have it now.

43:00.218 --> 43:03.263
And I think they're both dead now.

43:03.283 --> 43:06.187
I think Joyce Lancaster Wilson died finally.

43:06.227 --> 43:07.569
They're both dead.

43:08.010 --> 43:08.851
He was a lovely man.

43:09.672 --> 43:16.062
He was the one who was helping to finance the Davis work on the Gutenberg, you know, the cyclotron work.

43:16.663 --> 43:19.948
And I remember embracing him the last time we took the volume out.

43:20.266 --> 43:23.232
Because I had a notion I wouldn't see him again, and I didn't.

43:23.332 --> 43:25.897
Is Sean Hinman still alive?

43:25.917 --> 43:26.598
I have no idea.

43:26.618 --> 43:28.261
I'd love to talk to him.

43:28.301 --> 43:30.004
The Folger folks would know.

43:30.065 --> 43:31.026
Anybody at the Folger.

43:31.046 --> 43:33.832
Is that an interesting concept, the Hinman collator?

43:35.435 --> 43:36.517
You talk about bibliography.

43:36.577 --> 43:36.998
Of course.

43:37.358 --> 43:38.460
And it goes on and on.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.165
We have the comparator.

43:41.226 --> 43:41.987
What is it?

43:42.676 --> 43:46.485
I can't remember the guy who did the comparator, but it's without the flashing lights.

43:46.565 --> 43:50.373
You do it all in your own eyeballs and temple.

43:52.538 --> 43:56.567
And there's another one now that you can take around in your briefcase.

43:56.615 --> 44:03.351
I have banned it in the room because the people who, the librarians who've watched it used, say that it's just destructive.

44:03.452 --> 44:04.715
What does it do?

44:04.775 --> 44:06.840
It collates one ambition against another?

44:06.860 --> 44:14.218
It's the same idea, but it teases you into flattening out.

44:14.198 --> 44:34.097
you see the two copies and that's what what's hard on us you know if you go through a folio book and you're going to flatten every opening you know well did Hinman resolve that problem with the folios you know they're not flat you know they're

44:34.077 --> 44:39.384
The Hinman puts the book about like that, the two covers.

44:39.504 --> 44:41.827
It's not anything like 180.

44:42.048 --> 44:57.368
It's something like between a right angle and a 180, which is usually the best design for a binding.

44:57.618 --> 44:58.740
Something less than 90.

44:59.221 --> 45:03.489
Something around 90.

45:03.670 --> 45:07.497
I don't know.

45:07.517 --> 45:12.707
I never had to watch people using a Hinman.

45:12.687 --> 45:14.850
I never had to learn this whole idea.

45:14.870 --> 45:23.361
Again, it feeds into the whole concept of texts and the importance of texts and why we still pay attention to them.

45:23.962 --> 45:26.465
Not merely as relics, as you were saying earlier.

45:26.625 --> 45:29.990
And all this seems all out of fashion now, too, doesn't it?

45:30.010 --> 45:30.430
Well, is it?

45:30.450 --> 45:32.253
We're going to find out.

45:32.273 --> 45:38.020
Terry Ballinger was saying the other day, he said, you know, Vanity Fair, Thackeray, he did his own vignettes.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.660
But every time Granite Fair is published today, it's done without Thackeray's own vignettes.

45:45.142 --> 45:50.558
He said, so you're really doing a disservice to the creation of that book, aren't you, in a way, by not publishing it?

45:50.791 --> 45:58.299
And in Henry Esmond, Thackeray picked, you know, mid-18th century typography.

45:59.260 --> 46:06.007
And if you reformat that in a modern typeface, you're doing a disservice to it.

46:06.027 --> 46:13.395
What are you going to say about Wizard of Oz?

46:13.475 --> 46:14.636
In what respect?

46:14.656 --> 46:17.119
To the pictures that came out in the first edition.

46:17.099 --> 46:22.069
Well, what do I have to know about them?

46:22.450 --> 46:29.985
Well, at Christmas time, I bought for my daughter a new Wizard of Oz illustrated by a Viennese woman.

46:30.306 --> 46:34.635
And I thought it was wonderful.

46:34.615 --> 46:41.221
It was very much different from, what is his name?

46:41.241 --> 46:51.931
You know, the thick line drawings of all those characters and the text wrapped around them.

46:52.051 --> 47:02.040
It's a kind of classic integration of text and image from the first edition through many reprints.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.885
It's not Denman Thompson, is he?

47:04.286 --> 47:07.817
W. W. Denslow, I believe.

47:07.837 --> 47:09.562
Denslow, isn't it?

47:09.602 --> 47:10.384
Who did that?

47:10.404 --> 47:13.212
I'll check it out.

47:13.394 --> 47:18.221
What about Huck Finn?

47:19.502 --> 47:28.254
What about the plumbing ballast?

47:29.155 --> 47:35.504
These are very close working.

47:36.445 --> 47:43.114
Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll and what's his name?

47:43.094 --> 47:48.243
These are very close collaborations.

47:48.263 --> 47:49.605
That's right.

47:49.645 --> 47:54.013
Tineo and Carol.

47:56.096 --> 47:57.859
Who is Mark Twain's illustrator?

47:57.879 --> 47:59.001
I forget that now.

47:59.422 --> 48:00.484
Well, I can't do it either.

48:01.365 --> 48:02.487
Place famous.

48:02.770 --> 48:11.442
But this is a good question for you as the teacher of the book.

48:11.662 --> 48:25.842
What kind of text do you expect your students to read to be exposed to them, and what kind of text do you expect to talk to them about?

48:25.822 --> 48:27.624
It's your call.

48:27.664 --> 48:54.327
And if you're going to do a history or a survey that touches these books, and you're going to illustrate, you're going to use illustrations in your book, which edition are you going to choose for your illustrations?

48:54.779 --> 48:56.864
Which will you perpetuate?

48:57.966 --> 49:13.682
We're going to compare illustrations and get something out of that.

49:13.882 --> 49:16.506
Well, then it becomes a scholarly enterprise.

49:16.526 --> 49:17.627
Well, it's all scholarly.

49:17.888 --> 49:18.989
Then what is unscholarly?

49:19.109 --> 49:22.574
Well, I'm saying, but actually producing a book for people, you know, for kids.

49:25.097 --> 49:38.556
Yeah, but you're the teacher, and you're choosing the edition your students are going to read, how they're going to get exposed to it, and you're choosing the edition you're going to talk about.

49:38.536 --> 49:42.160
What side do you come down on?

49:42.220 --> 49:46.044
Well, I don't know.

49:46.124 --> 49:49.068
I come down on the comparative side.

49:49.188 --> 49:54.734
Because I'm not teaching L. Frank Baum and I'm not teaching Lewis Carroll, I'm teaching books.

49:55.074 --> 50:03.784
One of my colleagues said, why can't you just put all the books in class in book stands, you know, open?

50:03.764 --> 50:07.090
Do you anticipate a time... To openings, you know?

50:07.210 --> 50:08.052
You know this way?

50:08.112 --> 50:08.292
Yeah.

50:08.473 --> 50:10.897
So that you'd have an exhibition.

50:11.258 --> 50:17.510
And of course the problem in an exhibition is you only get one opening of each book.

50:18.031 --> 50:19.814
And the answer to that is that I'm teaching books.

50:19.874 --> 50:21.958
I'm not teaching...

50:21.938 --> 50:45.617
single text and I'm comparing books and and it may be in a very very efficient way to teach to start with the binding and the lettering on the spine and the decoration of the edges and the composition of the covers you know when you have a book that I had a book that I was showing the other day for a binding a la grec

50:45.597 --> 51:10.491
you know with a little bump on the on the edge you know and i just happened to see that there's this arabesque in the middle this is this binding system that came to europe out of the middle east right that uh you can just think of all those incutables where the central panel is just rolled down six times or something like that

51:10.471 --> 51:36.276
uh they didn't have any strong centers that you know and the arabs had this strong side well i got a chance to to explain about that uh along with the binding and then opening to to see the ruling of the vellum that that had made the kind of register in the scriptorium that we've been talking about how you get that with point holes in the printing house

51:36.256 --> 51:48.271
mimicking this absolute register where the two pages on the leaf match up absolutely when you look, you know, with the light in back and all that.

51:50.154 --> 51:58.905
So that for me, I'm interested in getting everything I can out of that copy of that book, not just the opening, which may make the point.

51:59.695 --> 52:24.252
um that has to be uh made at that uh point that moment in the in the in the development of ideas and of course so i would like to compare things because i'm not uh i'm not teaching i'll fight bomb i'm or or even book illustration but i'm trying to get uh people get students to think of um

52:24.502 --> 52:31.525
you know, maybe a German way of doing something at the same time as the French way of doing something and what the differences are.

52:31.741 --> 52:36.749
And to understand a little bit better what goes on in Germany because you see the French example.

52:38.452 --> 52:42.258
Well, this one is Medieval Studies.

52:44.221 --> 52:47.547
So we're trying to look at the first hundred years of printing.

52:47.667 --> 52:56.922
But the other ones, as you know, is a bibliography course, 296, which is material bibliography out of Gaskell now.

52:56.902 --> 53:07.240
And the third one is printed books as a field of study, which is that Adams course, in which we just start with 15th century books, and we wind up with 20th century books.

53:07.300 --> 53:11.567
And at a certain point, we look at books the students like to see.

53:12.048 --> 53:15.113
They tell me what.

53:15.093 --> 53:23.084
The Adam students have to be undergraduates.

53:24.025 --> 53:27.931
This is under the auspices of Adam's house, you see.

53:27.971 --> 53:30.394
No graduate students.

53:30.714 --> 53:36.583
And they pay me off with a 35-page paper on material bibliography.

53:37.744 --> 53:42.771
And the last one, the best in the last one, was...

53:42.751 --> 53:46.475
How did Piranesi sequence the images in his books?

53:51.942 --> 53:54.144
You know Piranesi?

53:54.725 --> 54:00.972
We may think of Piranesi when we see him framed on people's walls, but they're all books.

54:01.513 --> 54:04.216
Those are plates out of books.

54:04.937 --> 54:11.965
And there are plans and there are elevations and there's a contents page.

54:11.945 --> 54:17.051
There are details, you know, it's all kinds of things going on in those plates.

54:18.053 --> 54:23.439
And one of the ways in which you could sequence, something like that, and how did he do it?

54:24.180 --> 54:28.606
He's a Harvard undergraduate.

54:28.686 --> 54:31.490
One of the best papers I ever saw.

54:31.790 --> 54:39.159
So he paid me royally for that correspondence.

54:39.319 --> 54:41.462
Well, he was interested in Piranesi.

54:42.944 --> 55:02.978
who else could you pick if you hadn't picked who else would you else would you have picked anybody you wanted doesn't matter the main thing is the student has to know something about it and the material has to be available here so if you're a great expert on something we don't have it doesn't want it

55:03.143 --> 55:08.249
If you're a medium expert or a very inquisitor about something we do have, it works.

55:08.409 --> 55:11.973
You can do something.

55:12.013 --> 55:13.314
We have to have something here.

55:13.354 --> 55:14.956
That's the key, isn't it?

55:15.176 --> 55:15.296
No.

55:15.316 --> 55:17.659
The key is to have something here.

55:17.739 --> 55:19.641
Goes back to collections, doesn't it?

55:19.661 --> 55:25.708
And you see, the fun of this is that I'm teaching with research collections, not with specimen collections.

55:26.212 --> 55:34.324
That's what I was talking about when you and I are in a college somewhere and we want to teach book history where we start buying specimens, you know, one of this and one of that.

55:35.545 --> 55:37.268
You know, it's like Bellinger.

55:38.289 --> 55:39.210
He has specimens.

55:39.531 --> 55:40.452
Yeah.

55:40.733 --> 55:43.136
And I take my specimens out of research collections.

55:45.439 --> 55:49.485
If a student says, well, it's always children's books, well, I've got...

55:49.465 --> 56:06.284
I've got fable books from the 15th century, and I've got just about every genre that you would want, including the 65 Alice, you know, all that kind of thing.

56:06.304 --> 56:08.226
Define for me the difference between it.

56:08.306 --> 56:13.072
I know what it is, but I want you to define a research collection and a specialty collection.

56:13.092 --> 56:17.937
Do you have a working definition of that?

56:18.271 --> 56:33.047
Well, we should narrow it down.

56:33.067 --> 56:37.992
Narrow it down.

56:39.434 --> 56:41.376
In general,

56:41.356 --> 56:43.418
This is terrific.

56:43.439 --> 56:44.860
Well, let's just take the incanabula.

56:45.161 --> 56:57.996
Now, the Huntington Library had the great collection of incanabula in this country, and it was just outdone by the Library of Congress when they got the bull bear collection, and you know about the politics and all that.

56:58.597 --> 57:07.127
And suddenly, the Library of Congress went from John Boyd Thatcher and some other collection, which was a nice specimen collection.

57:07.107 --> 57:13.536
to having a major holding, I mean, tons of incannabula.

57:14.016 --> 57:23.869
And Harvard is nothing like that, but it's got, as you know from Jim Walsh's book, thousands of incannabula.

57:25.191 --> 57:29.537
So that when I want to show incannabula

57:30.057 --> 57:51.545
I've got just about all the genres that you would want to show, from things like the Schatzbehaltar and the Nuremberg Chronicle to the Breidenbach or the fold-out views of cities.

57:52.466 --> 57:56.031
I bought myself the indulgences

57:56.500 --> 58:04.451
And the donatus leaves so that you can see a donatus present from movable type and one cut from wood.

58:04.492 --> 58:05.934
Donatus?

58:06.414 --> 58:08.698
He's a specimen.

58:09.719 --> 58:12.022
But this is out of an enormous research collection.

58:12.042 --> 58:17.310
And I've added to it a lot of things.

58:17.560 --> 58:22.365
Any of the Aldeans except for one or two?

58:22.405 --> 58:26.429
You've got all the Aldeans except for one or two.

58:26.469 --> 58:37.720
You get weak back in the 50s, around the Gutenberg time, but by the time you get it in Canavia, Italy, it gets very strong.

58:40.183 --> 58:43.686
So that I could show you 35 incunables.

58:45.117 --> 59:11.698
out of a collection of thousands of incutables now if you and i are in a college and we're forming a study collection we're going to buy you know 10 10 incutables and those were the only incutables we have and we bought each one because it's different from the other it somehow increases the range of examples right um

59:12.185 --> 59:15.749
But when you think of teaching with research collections, you've got to limit it down.

59:15.829 --> 59:18.291
You can't say, all right, we're talking about modern Greek.

59:18.311 --> 59:26.320
You've got to talk about something like printing from 1450 to 1500.

59:26.580 --> 59:41.415
If you wanted to make a course on epic poems, you know, you start with Homer in 1488, you come up to, he's the West Indian poet,

59:41.834 --> 01:00:03.859
we did something well we have that book in the first edition uh and everything in between and i just bought another one you know i'm buying them all the time epic poems in the vernacular in the renaissance in the 17th century um

01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:17.258
So that if you wanted to make your constructor seminar out of 25 epic poems, you'd be constructing it out of 250 or 500 epic poems in...

01:00:17.592 --> 01:00:19.814
5,000 editions, you see?

01:00:20.335 --> 01:00:21.657
That's the way it goes.

01:00:21.817 --> 01:00:27.863
Does the faculty ask you, suggest to you things that they'd like you to add?

01:00:28.544 --> 01:00:31.147
Very seldom.

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:33.670
This has gone from 60 to zero.

01:00:35.412 --> 01:00:45.523
Early in the century, you've got scholars who really cared about subject and genres, like George Lyman Kittredge.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.924
He's the one who got us into folklore.

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:56.024
It was an adjunct to Shakespeare studies, and we have ballads.

01:00:56.224 --> 01:01:01.318
Not only do we have ballads and chapbooks from the early years, but we have...
