00:03.001 --> 00:25.853
Well, you're asking me about how my father started collecting, and I have to tell you that I'm not 100% sure about this, but he was a good scholar, and he got interested in history.

00:26.255 --> 00:31.807
Then he did some work down in Texas and began to get interested in Texas.

00:32.469 --> 00:41.428
I think it all just sort of came along gradually and my father and mother weren't married until he was old.

00:41.408 --> 00:45.014
10 years or more out of college.

00:45.054 --> 00:50.984
Now he had already been a practicing lawyer, etc.

00:51.184 --> 00:55.932
And I think that even begun to collect before he was married.

00:56.713 --> 01:01.361
His mother and father were married in 1917.

01:01.461 --> 01:02.843
I was born in 1918.

01:04.645 --> 01:09.730
Father suffered the worst indignity that could possibly overcome a collector.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.453
The depression came along.

01:12.513 --> 01:24.425
He was active in financial matters and was very overextended at the time the crash came in 1929.

01:25.887 --> 01:29.050
We children, of course, weren't aware of this, but

01:29.249 --> 01:39.259
I'm sure my mother as well as my father was very aware in any event he had to sell Some of the things that he bought in the 20s

01:39.475 --> 01:59.661
prize things that he'd bought and the remarkable thing is that after the depression was over and he survived and he began to come back financially he was able to regain i think every one of the items that he sold and in quite a few cases the same copies

01:59.928 --> 02:16.502
And of course his connections with dealers, he always had a very good relationship with many dealers and I'm sure that was an estimable value in recovering these things.

02:16.482 --> 02:17.523
Were you collecting?

02:18.144 --> 02:18.525
Oh, no.

02:18.765 --> 02:22.270
It's quite clear in my mind.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.454
I was not a collector in my father's lifetime.

02:25.494 --> 02:34.025
As you know, at his death, he provided that his collection be sold at auction.

02:35.026 --> 02:40.093
He said to us children and my mother many times,

02:40.310 --> 02:50.162
How could he tell what library that he wished to support, what item they wanted?

02:51.123 --> 03:03.178
So the process that he chose was to put the collection up for sale and at the same time designate a certain amount of the proceeds to

03:03.158 --> 03:07.044
I believe that this is all recorded, I believe.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.769
I'm not telling you anything new.

03:10.069 --> 03:10.951
It's all recorded.

03:13.335 --> 03:16.520
The number of institutions that were just kind of in.

03:16.540 --> 03:20.627
I was going to say 15, but you may be right.

03:20.607 --> 03:25.798
In any event, that seemed to all of us like a very reasonable approach to this thing.

03:26.119 --> 03:40.168
And in fact, of course, was one of the reasons why the sale did so well, because a number of these libraries used this provision in my father's will

03:40.655 --> 03:59.153
to go to their supporters and say look we have a wonderful chance to buy some things and we'd like to see you match the street of the quest or whatever well it did work well the streeter collection is the great 20th century collection

03:59.437 --> 04:06.729
Part of its pain derives from the fact that it was so old after his father's death.

04:06.989 --> 04:11.436
He did not wish to leave it intact and have his name on it.

04:11.597 --> 04:12.979
And I admire him for that.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.947
He felt that he wanted other people to have the pleasure of collecting.

04:18.087 --> 04:21.833
And to the extent of my own involvement,

04:21.813 --> 04:40.117
Certainly what he did got me started because I went to the early sales, naturally interested in what was taking place, but then I got sort of involved in buying a few things.

04:40.138 --> 04:41.640
What kinds of things did you start?

04:41.660 --> 04:42.581
Well, that was it.

04:42.601 --> 04:45.745
You see, some people have said to me,

04:45.725 --> 04:49.711
Are you trying to duplicate your father's collection?

04:49.731 --> 04:51.033
Well, absurd.

04:51.474 --> 04:52.555
I never had that intention.

04:53.016 --> 04:58.404
Would not have been able to carry it out if I had had the intention, and it wouldn't have made any sense.

04:58.424 --> 05:04.213
My initial purchases were just sort of items of curiosity.

05:05.475 --> 05:09.040
I thought for a while, perhaps I can develop some collection.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.128
People from Europe who came over,

05:14.412 --> 05:23.521
and examined the American experiment and wrote about the form of government and the form of agriculture and the organization of cities.

05:23.961 --> 05:26.183
But that really wasn't a terribly interesting subject.

05:26.684 --> 05:32.169
And after a couple of small maneuvers in that direction, I sort of dropped that.

05:32.189 --> 05:40.437
And about the time that sale number four came along, I had started to

05:40.417 --> 05:46.253
really focused my interest on voyages of discovery.

05:46.273 --> 05:53.211
Now that was not a crime area of Dad's collecting interest,

05:53.613 --> 06:03.030
in collecting early printing, some of the early accounts appeared in his collection.

06:03.050 --> 06:07.238
And so quite a few of these were in catalog four, sale four.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.682
I got sort of started there.

06:10.864 --> 06:12.788
So you bought some of your father's things?

06:12.888 --> 06:17.376
Yeah, I have about two dozen items from father's sale.

06:17.356 --> 06:22.446
Do you think you'd have been pleased by how much you spent for these items as opposed to what he spent for them?

06:22.466 --> 06:35.550
Well, Dad was a shrewd call financially, and I know that he would have been terribly pleased at the success of the sale financially because he was a shrewd investment man.

06:36.003 --> 07:03.698
uh this of course was not the reason that he bought these books as an investment because he spent oh he retired from acting business after world war ii and he didn't die about 1965 so he was 20 years uh really devoting himself to his collection he had a librarian and a secretary full-time

07:03.678 --> 07:08.664
in our home in Morristown, New Jersey.

07:08.684 --> 07:12.209
And he devoted most of every day, or a good bit of every day.

07:12.269 --> 07:16.274
He'd go in and for quite some time he'd go to New York for an office in New York.

07:16.294 --> 07:18.116
Oh, maybe once a week or twice a week.

07:18.136 --> 07:27.688
And then, let's say, in the last years of his life, he probably went once every couple of months or something like that.

07:27.768 --> 07:29.010
He'll be right now.

07:29.277 --> 07:43.084
American Aquarian.

07:43.452 --> 07:46.860
He was on the... I think he was on the John... Yes, he was.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.366
He was a strong supporter of the John Carter Brown Library.

07:49.727 --> 07:51.090
That's Dr. Tom Adams down there.

07:51.110 --> 07:51.952
Yes, yes.

07:52.313 --> 07:57.947
Well, Lawrence Roth was an old friend of my father's, or became an old friend of my father's.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.533
So I would say that...

08:00.513 --> 08:07.045
American Antiquarian and John Carter Brown were certainly two.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.910
He must have had something to do with the Clements, I would think, as well.

08:10.151 --> 08:14.539
Well, you know, he was involved because those libraries were collecting in the same...

08:15.076 --> 08:32.528
and when he felt that that was completed he stopped

08:32.508 --> 08:36.994
That collection went to Yale.

08:37.014 --> 08:41.320
He had a good connection with Archie.

08:43.963 --> 08:44.604
But they bought it.

08:44.684 --> 08:46.707
I mean, that was not a gift to Yale.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.189
They bought it.

08:48.209 --> 08:52.595
He was glad to have it go to Yale, but it wasn't a gift.

08:52.996 --> 08:54.077
Yale was through a wall.

08:54.665 --> 09:00.932
Well, much of my book is about hopes to describe the passion of the collector.

09:00.952 --> 09:05.477
Perhaps you can describe your father's thoughts about that.

09:05.517 --> 09:07.619
Secondly, did you share his passion?

09:07.639 --> 09:12.224
Of course, you can describe the passion that he had for the books.

09:12.284 --> 09:15.027
Did it dominate his life?

09:15.047 --> 09:19.272
How he told you he became so interested in books and collecting?

09:19.505 --> 09:22.889
My father was not outwardly a passionate man.

09:24.211 --> 09:27.254
He was a very reasonable man.

09:27.915 --> 09:33.942
I'm sure that he had great dedication in various areas, obviously in his book area.

09:34.263 --> 09:38.748
But he didn't, as far as we children were concerned, it was just his activity.

09:38.808 --> 09:40.230
It was just...

09:40.210 --> 09:58.067
other fathers did other things we knew that dad was finally interested in this but it was not an area that he that he talked to us about a great deal or at least he didn't talk to me about it my sister was at home during the war

09:58.047 --> 10:14.727
She's some years younger than I. My two brothers and I were off in the war, I think maybe at that time, and my mother was off in the war as women commander of the Women Marine Corps.

10:14.747 --> 10:25.000
So she was off, and my sister was home a good bit, and she may have had more opportunity to learn from us.

10:24.980 --> 10:40.288
As far as I was concerned, the picture I have of my father is actually personified in a crayon drawing that somebody did at the time of him sitting at a big table in his studies.

10:40.268 --> 10:42.873
which used to be our playroom.

10:43.274 --> 10:52.131
And I know that we felt rather miffed when we were ousted from the playrooms and beg room for my father's study.

10:53.013 --> 10:56.961
But in any event, we had a great long table there.

10:56.941 --> 11:06.260
and covered with papers, and his payon drawing shows him sitting at the table with the two table lamps.

11:06.500 --> 11:13.414
His briefcase is on the floor beside him, but he's looking at a catalog or whatever.

11:13.394 --> 11:29.217
So we knew about his deep involvement and also a continuous stream of people in and out of the house, fellow collectors and dealers, librarians.

11:30.479 --> 11:34.525
My father was very interested in

11:34.842 --> 11:44.612
exchanging gossip and talking to and keeping in touch with a great many people in his field.

11:45.733 --> 11:50.678
And I think they all, he was a very hospitable man, and so was my mother.

11:50.938 --> 11:56.503
And all these people were made welcome in our home, and I think they all enjoyed it.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.826
So we did see that that was an area.

11:58.866 --> 12:00.327
Did Bradley Martin come out?

12:00.307 --> 12:01.509
Oh, I don't think that.

12:01.809 --> 12:03.752
There are not so many other collectors.

12:04.633 --> 12:12.183
Well, Bradley Martin would have been a good bit younger, I think, wouldn't he?

12:12.203 --> 12:13.125
A bit younger, yes.

12:13.465 --> 12:16.970
I mean, he was fairly reclusive himself.

12:16.990 --> 12:17.431
Well, yes.

12:17.471 --> 12:21.636
He probably wouldn't have been interested, I don't know.

12:21.656 --> 12:24.981
Well, Dad was not reclusive at all about his collection.

12:24.961 --> 12:39.175
You see, by the time the war was over, I was on my own.

12:39.195 --> 12:51.087
In fact, my brothers and all of us were on our own by that time, and we were not living at home.

12:51.067 --> 12:57.336
When we were out visiting, there was no particular occasion to actually go.

12:57.356 --> 13:04.065
I have to say that, no, I was not personally interested in what made up the collection.

13:04.206 --> 13:15.101
I was obviously interested that my father found this such a commanding interest, interested in the people that came, and many of them were extremely interesting people.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.725
Do you think this amused other members as a family?

13:17.745 --> 13:19.487
I mean, if you see this so often,

13:19.467 --> 13:34.488
I wouldn't say there's any sense of amusement about it, or even bemusement.

13:34.548 --> 13:38.674
This is just Dad's thing.

13:38.654 --> 13:45.461
Other fathers did other things that they spend a lot of money We didn't know that he spent a lot of money on it.

13:45.481 --> 14:05.083
I mean if we never my father certainly never discussed his finances with any of his children I mean in those days he didn't I Don't think any of us were aware of the

14:05.502 --> 14:17.074
I think of course it brought a lot more than anybody expected.

14:17.154 --> 14:18.255
When did you discover that?

14:18.296 --> 14:18.796
At the sale?

14:18.976 --> 14:20.057
At the sale?

14:21.058 --> 14:21.559
Oh, sure.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.561
I wouldn't say that any of us.

14:24.342 --> 14:28.286
My sister conceivably might have had, but I don't think so.

14:28.446 --> 14:30.568
Father never made a fuss about it.

14:30.809 --> 14:32.050
It was just something he did.

14:32.452 --> 14:50.865
uh when he didn't talk about it to any great degree with us and then we all had other things that we were interested in i think it's also important to point out he is almost the the archetypical scholar collector i mean this is a man

14:50.845 --> 14:55.811
to not only collect it, but he basically paved the way.

14:55.891 --> 14:58.915
I mean, his catalogs were still the standard.

14:59.236 --> 15:00.617
That's right.

15:00.657 --> 15:06.705
He absolutely devised certain areas of collection.

15:06.945 --> 15:10.390
I mean, the bibliographical record, in many respects, is much bigger.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.073
No, an extraordinarily intelligent way.

15:13.053 --> 15:30.995
Extraordinary intelligence collection, I think that's... But I think Dad would be the first to say that he benefited from the sources that he used, I mean, the dealers, the librarians.

15:31.576 --> 15:39.786
My father was a student of human nature as well as financial behavior, a scholarly person into the bargain.

15:39.766 --> 15:50.023
And he fully believed in mining the accumulated wealth of knowledge of other people.

15:50.544 --> 15:58.336
Now, he absorbed it very much himself, and I think it's wonderful that he put it back onto the market, so to speak, with his cattle hogs, as you say.

15:58.376 --> 16:04.646
Do your children collect?

16:04.827 --> 16:05.588
No.

16:05.568 --> 16:08.731
I can't afford to collect.

16:08.811 --> 16:13.595
Well, actually, somebody said that to me the other day, and I said, that's baloney.

16:13.635 --> 16:16.157
I mean, you know, you depend upon collects.

16:16.438 --> 16:17.238
Let's put it this way.

16:19.040 --> 16:23.364
I suppose some children collect baseball cards and all kinds of things.

16:23.384 --> 16:24.445
Well, they're more valuable.

16:24.465 --> 16:27.547
But now, of course, they might be getting out to be very valuable.

16:27.567 --> 16:32.652
Who would believe that one card could be worth, you know, quite as much as a Chamberlain.

16:32.732 --> 16:34.954
Or as much as a Columbus letter.

16:34.974 --> 16:35.254
Yeah.

16:35.234 --> 16:41.664
I was not a collector as a child at all.

16:42.265 --> 16:49.677
I was not a collector later my father died and started focusing on what he'd done.

16:49.697 --> 16:59.132
Did you make that true of my brothers and my sister?

16:59.568 --> 17:01.612
No, no, no, no.

17:01.632 --> 17:02.674
Who was the owner of this?

17:02.694 --> 17:04.197
It's not written.

17:04.217 --> 17:06.161
It wasn't identified in the catalog.

17:06.181 --> 17:13.656
It wasn't identified in the catalog, but in fact, because the owner initially didn't want to be identified, but then it became, from general knowledge, a man named Copeland.

17:14.457 --> 17:16.221
Bill Copeland from California.

17:17.243 --> 17:21.070
She earned a chain of sporting goods stores.

17:21.050 --> 17:23.333
But he owned this for a long time?

17:23.413 --> 17:25.036
No, he hadn't actually.

17:25.056 --> 17:32.927
He put together this collection really over the last five or six years, a really short time.

17:33.709 --> 17:40.138
Which also meant that it was conceivably more of a challenge to tell us.

17:40.962 --> 17:56.811
I think it was absolutely genuinely a question of trying to put together a

17:56.791 --> 18:03.479
the best of everything in terms of what's memorabilia.

18:03.599 --> 18:22.461
And I think one has to be very careful about using the word speculation because, I mean, obviously anybody who spends a lot of money on a book or a work of art or even a baseball card doesn't want to have the feeling that you're spending it on something which is worthless tomorrow.

18:22.778 --> 18:28.770
I mean, you would then feel very guilty towards your spouse and your family and god knows what else.

18:28.810 --> 18:31.155
So you would have a feeling the value is somehow retained there.

18:31.536 --> 18:32.959
But I don't think that's speculation.

18:34.843 --> 18:37.007
I think sometimes it's used as a crutch

18:37.139 --> 18:38.902
particularly with one's family.

18:38.922 --> 18:56.413
I mean, I know that Bradley Martin would explain to Mrs. Martin that, in fact, the collection was extremely valuable, and it was a worthwhile enterprise, also, because at that point, that was not why Bradley Martin collected the awful record of art everywhere.
