WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:08.213
So we're talking to Mr. Bill Moyers, and congratulations, sir.

00:08.233 --> 00:09.094
Thank you.

00:09.114 --> 00:26.239
I'm interested in the decision of the journalist to go out and write about something that is so subjective.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.000
It's not abstract, really, as poetry.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.464
And we'll discuss it in a general manner like that if we can.

00:30.018 --> 00:49.859
Yeah, ever since I started in public broadcasting 25 years ago, I had taken as my mandate what Benjamin Harris said was his mandate in the first newspaper in America called Public Occurrences, Both Foreign and Domestic, in 1691.

00:49.979 --> 00:55.485
And he said his mandate was to give an account of such considerable things as have come to my attention.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.038
As a journalist, that's what I try to do.

00:58.058 --> 01:02.382
We journalists are licensed to explain things they don't understand, and there's a lot I don't understand.

01:02.842 --> 01:11.190
So I like to go out, become a good student, gather the information, sort it out, weigh it, evaluate it, and then share it with a larger audience.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.011
I look for things that interest me.

01:14.272 --> 01:20.538
But as a journalist, and I hope a reasonably good journalist, I look for what's happening out there that I might not have known about.

01:21.239 --> 01:26.063
And what I see as a journalist is an enormous resurgence across America.

01:26.988 --> 01:32.433
in poetry and performance poetry in particular.

01:32.774 --> 01:33.354
Amazing.

01:33.374 --> 01:33.514
Yeah.

01:33.795 --> 01:34.315
It is fascinating.

01:34.335 --> 01:38.319
The New York Times said recently, poetry's come out of the smoky cafes into the street.

01:38.860 --> 01:44.865
The New York Daily News had an emblazoned headline, let's not mince words, poetry's big.

01:45.546 --> 01:46.547
Yeah, it's all in there.

01:46.567 --> 01:56.877
The New York Times just last week had a huge spread on the phenomenon of poetry.

01:57.042 --> 02:08.752
So something's going on out there that any good journalist, particularly one who takes as his beat the world of ideas, has to take notice of, has to take note of.

02:08.772 --> 02:10.194
And so this is really an effort.

02:11.815 --> 02:17.700
Actually, poetry is not as subjective as the layman thinks.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.781
Poetry is very precise.

02:18.841 --> 02:19.602
It's concrete.

02:20.042 --> 02:26.408
Poets labor for the specific word in order to incarnate

02:26.692 --> 02:29.296
a feeling, to give flesh to.

02:29.356 --> 02:31.479
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was made flesh.

02:31.639 --> 02:38.750
And poets give flesh to ideas, flesh to feelings, flesh to emotions, flesh to curiosity.

02:39.491 --> 02:47.443
And so it's very specific, and that's what I hope people grasp when they watch the series, which is on June 23rd, or when they read this.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.544
That's very important.

02:48.564 --> 02:48.684
Yeah.

02:48.704 --> 02:50.888
I don't mean to interrupt.

02:50.908 --> 02:51.889
No, that's all right.

02:51.909 --> 02:52.530
I am...

02:53.219 --> 02:57.444
I've syndicated myself over the last year and was really 23 newspapers.

02:57.464 --> 02:57.765
Good.

02:57.785 --> 02:59.287
I just started in Austin, Texas.

02:59.307 --> 02:59.607
Good.

02:59.667 --> 03:00.629
Austin American States.

03:00.869 --> 03:01.590
American States.

03:01.710 --> 03:07.537
I just went to Tallahassee and Charlottesville, a really targeted university of towns.

03:07.557 --> 03:09.600
I mean, Eugene, Oregon, Gainesville.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.321
Good.

03:10.581 --> 03:13.165
Knoxville, Gainesville, Charlottesville.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.508
Good readers in those cities.

03:15.568 --> 03:18.532
That's what I've really mindfully done at.

03:18.552 --> 03:19.052
Good idea.

03:19.273 --> 03:21.375
And it's working, you know.

03:21.395 --> 03:22.437
Fingers crossed.

03:22.457 --> 03:22.737
Good.

03:23.307 --> 03:27.412
But in any case, this is kind of— June 23rd is when the series aired.

03:27.612 --> 03:36.262
There's a great—television can serve books and vice versa, and I've shown that with Giff Campbell and The Power of Myth and Healing in the Mind and The World of Ideas.

03:37.364 --> 03:40.227
But in this case, I'm documenting something.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.990
It's not just that I've gone out because I love poetry, which I do.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.294
I've even written some poetry I can understand.

03:46.747 --> 03:48.449
You mentioned your wife is a poet as well.

03:48.469 --> 03:49.330
Yes, she is.

03:49.350 --> 03:51.553
It's a better poet than some, I know.

03:51.613 --> 03:56.820
I just noticed something happening.

03:56.941 --> 04:02.388
If you were a journalist walking down the street and you saw a crowd around an automobile, you'd run over to it and cover the wreck.

04:03.129 --> 04:06.433
And I see something out there that needs covering.

04:06.453 --> 04:14.203
And that's really what this series and this book are trying to do, to document an amazing renaissance.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.146
The biggest renaissance, I think,

04:16.379 --> 04:19.863
since the beat generation in the 50s.

04:20.303 --> 04:30.053
Now, I'm quite impressed by the balance, the cultural balance that you sought out and represented in here.

04:30.654 --> 04:42.225
Was that important for you to really try and represent the full spectrum of... Well, it was important for me as a journalist to report what is actually happening.

04:42.245 --> 04:43.787
And what is happening is that

04:44.493 --> 04:50.099
an enormous range of voices are now getting heard through poetry.

04:50.119 --> 05:02.911
Ethnic poets, cowboy poets, Native American poets, Vietnam veteran poets, Persian Gulf veteran poets, gay poets, feminist poets, men's movement poets, African American poets.

05:03.472 --> 05:13.842
And that's the, as I say in the foreword of the book, that's the great democratic crucible in which our new identity is being forged in the language of these

05:14.733 --> 05:20.900
new Americans who are contributing their idiom and their ideas to the American League.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.682
What do we have in common except language?

05:23.523 --> 05:34.416
And this new language that's being created, coming from these varieties of people, is giving democracy new vitality and the democratic conversation new vitality.

05:34.436 --> 05:38.260
However, I didn't choose these books, these poets, arbitrarily.

05:39.151 --> 05:46.139
I covered, we covered in our television series, the Dodge Poetry Festival in Waterloo, New Jersey.

05:46.559 --> 06:03.779
And it's the festival that brings these poets from all over the country from many tributaries of culture and experience and persuasion and identity to Waterloo every other year to perform before thousands of people, including thousands of young people.

06:04.139 --> 06:07.403
So I'm there with my cameras to document

06:08.294 --> 06:14.300
What others have identified is, who know more about poetry than I do, is happening in the country.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.081
That's why there's such a diversity.

06:16.101 --> 06:27.432
I'm really impressed with so many of the people that I just, Marley, just sent the book over here at my hotel, so you'll have to forgive me for having to send me the whole thing.

06:27.452 --> 06:28.173
I do that, too.

06:28.193 --> 06:33.698
I promise you that by the time we write the piece later this week, it'll be thorough.

06:33.718 --> 06:35.820
But I'm really impressed by what I've read.

06:36.222 --> 06:39.146
of how so many of these poets actually think of imagery.

06:40.087 --> 06:42.611
It's not just the imagery that shows up in the written word.

06:42.951 --> 06:48.479
When you ask them a question, you depict these stunning images.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.461
I have to get which poet it is.

06:50.481 --> 06:55.889
The words become formless after a while, and you really just have to give them an invigorating.

06:55.909 --> 06:56.750
Yes, Stan McHughness.

06:56.770 --> 07:00.014
He says that after a while, we wear words down.

07:00.075 --> 07:00.876
They exhaust.

07:01.476 --> 07:04.120
They are exhausted, and we have to then go deep to fight

07:04.522 --> 07:15.879
to define them again and give them a new power, to resurrect them and send them marching off in the service of our intelligence and our emotions.

07:15.899 --> 07:24.792
You also asked Manley, it is interesting that nobody does commit contemporary poetry or memory anywhere.

07:25.313 --> 07:27.556
That is quite a departure from them.

07:27.576 --> 07:30.681
When we were going to school, we memorized them.

07:31.268 --> 07:40.381
Well, that's a consequence of the media culture, I'm sure, in which the heavy lifting is done by someone else.

07:40.521 --> 07:43.325
I mean, television does your work for you.

07:43.686 --> 07:49.354
People are not accustomed to listening as much as they used to.

07:50.055 --> 07:52.358
You don't have to cock your ears, you just have to turn on your set.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.905
Language has moved from the street to the set, to the radio.

07:57.273 --> 08:06.868
to the audio cassette, to the desk, to the rock and roll, to the rap, to the sitcom, to the news.

08:09.231 --> 08:25.997
We have surrogate listeners now, and they go in here and package and present to us, and we're not being trained in the harnessing of the monomic powers for our own benefit, the way you and I were when we were growing up.

08:26.922 --> 08:34.753
required memorization from us, not because they expected us to love poetry, but because they wanted us to sharpen the tools of our intelligence.

08:35.214 --> 08:39.941
And memory was the best real sergeant you could enlist for that purpose.

08:40.962 --> 08:46.450
But even then, so many poems, as you mentioned, again, with Coons, and I didn't keep running that.

08:46.550 --> 08:48.493
Well, he's one of my, he's a giant.

08:49.054 --> 08:51.377
And I have corresponded with him and talked about it.

08:52.707 --> 08:58.455
And he actually, in a letter he wrote to me, he said, well, I kind of had your job once upon a time.

08:58.636 --> 09:00.658
Very nice, very classy print.

09:00.678 --> 09:08.490
But you mentioned at the beginning of my talk how this is a great renaissance, and poetry is going through a great renaissance.

09:08.510 --> 09:17.322
Were you fearful when you started this that perhaps poetry, after all these thousands of years, has been so central for the lives of every culture?

09:17.342 --> 09:22.630
I mean, a poet has always been a sustained, honored, revered person, and that

09:23.183 --> 09:28.811
for whatever causes this more or less had fallen out.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.212
Now you see it coming back.

09:30.232 --> 09:37.402
Were you fearful that the role of the poet, the function of the poet, has perhaps been disappearing?

09:38.283 --> 09:53.123
I was concerned that the poet was being exiled to the margins, particularly to the academic world, where poetry was subjected to the kind of deconstruction that took the life out of it.

09:53.491 --> 09:55.254
and said it is less than its parts.

09:56.797 --> 10:16.073
I was concerned that poetry was becoming just an exotic wrestling match for linguistic scholars and not something for the rest of us, not something that was about life.

10:17.217 --> 10:21.583
I did a series back in 1908 called The Power of the Word, which was also about poets.

10:21.603 --> 10:46.414
It was the first series David Rubin and I did on poets, although I have done many individual poets in my 25 years in broadcasting, from the first television interview Maya Angelou did back in 1973, to Robert Finn Warren, to Archibald MacLeish, who was one of my favorites, now sort of forgotten and ignored, but he'll be back, mark my word, when cultural historians look at this last 50 years of American life.

10:46.495 --> 10:58.025
And I was concerned that poetry, like art, had lost its touch, had become the token of collectors and not the passion of ordinary people like art was.

10:58.045 --> 11:00.087
You lost its relevance, isn't it?

11:00.107 --> 11:01.909
Yeah, lost its relevance.

11:02.729 --> 11:09.275
I had, although I kept finding people who admitted to writing poetry but not letting anyone read it.

11:09.956 --> 11:10.797
And I kept running it.

11:10.897 --> 11:14.680
I was here in Chicago one night about four years ago.

11:15.301 --> 11:33.837
at a hotel down the street, came back from a dinner meeting, got back to the hotel about 10 o'clock, and I was, you know, picked up a weekly newspaper that was distributed in the hotel, looked at it, and it said that in a former bar just down the street, Portia was being read every Friday night.

11:33.977 --> 11:34.798
So it was Friday night.

11:35.078 --> 11:36.880
I walked down there three or four blocks, went in.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.521
It was amazing what I encountered.

11:39.001 --> 11:44.346
The place was full of people listening, of verbalizers and

11:44.579 --> 11:50.627
people would stand up, recite their own poem, and then people would judge it.

11:50.727 --> 11:55.093
They would get up and create poetry in response to it.

11:55.113 --> 12:01.562
Some people would get up and read poetry they'd written 30 years ago, or get up and read their favorite poems from one of the, you know, from Tennyson or Shelley.

12:01.842 --> 12:07.009
It was an amazing, dazzling display.

12:07.428 --> 12:10.871
of language in the lives of ordinary people in that poem.

12:10.891 --> 12:18.479
When you talk to these individual poets, were you hopeful of getting some kind of sense and grasp on the creative process?

12:18.599 --> 12:22.083
And if that was involved, tell me some of the things that we learned.

12:22.103 --> 12:31.012
What's unique about the book, I think, is that for the first time you have the interviews intercut with the poems themselves.

12:31.032 --> 12:34.515
You often read Partisan Review, Partisan Review,

12:34.883 --> 12:40.569
any of the other poetry journals, and they'll simply have the poetry printed there, or they'll have an interview with the poet.

12:41.130 --> 12:59.389
But we have connected the two so that you can begin to see where an image begins to form in the mind of a poet, what life experience informs that poet, how it is that a poet looks at a tree and sees something you and I don't see, or looks at a common object like a grapefruit,

12:59.470 --> 13:03.976
and gets out of it what Gerald Stern got out of it in his poem about a grapefruit.

13:03.996 --> 13:11.527
I never eat grapefruit at home now in my apartment in New York without thinking of Gerald Stern with his hand up raised, squeezing that grapefruit.

13:12.368 --> 13:22.303
You begin to see that the gift of the poet is to make connections that most of us miss, and you begin to see how the world looks to a poet.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.925
It's not at all together

13:24.226 --> 13:29.654
like it looks to us, until the poet describes it for us, and then we say, yes, that's exactly what I've done.

13:29.714 --> 13:32.157
The juxtaposition is, of course, really wonderful.

13:32.237 --> 13:39.708
I mean, you wrote a poem, and then I don't recall who the woman is, but you asked about a line, a fleckle poem.

13:39.748 --> 13:40.249
Yeah.

13:40.369 --> 13:45.836
We have that here, and then you go right into the Q&A aspects of it.

13:45.856 --> 13:50.423
I think it really does give you a nice sense of the product and the process.

13:50.443 --> 13:54.148
You begin to get a—you begin to see how they create it, but the creative—

13:54.415 --> 14:04.027
furnace in a person is not some ancient mystical fire that's burning there that is not available to the rest of it.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.550
It's a matter of concentration.

14:06.951 --> 14:09.314
It's a matter of comparison and analogy.

14:09.795 --> 14:20.288
It's a matter of deliberately focusing and thinking through what you see, of being open to metaphors, so that

14:20.673 --> 14:29.843
people who are amateur poets can improve their own poetry by paying attention to people who do it primarily for themselves.

14:31.665 --> 14:32.086
I guess they are.

14:32.106 --> 14:36.251
Some of the superstars really can make a living as poets.

14:38.153 --> 14:39.414
Not a lot of them.

14:39.815 --> 14:41.797
Yeah, that's probably right.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.100
Who was it who said poets are made, not paid?

14:44.160 --> 14:46.242
That's right.

14:46.660 --> 14:52.647
So is there a professional poet in our culture?

14:52.667 --> 15:03.058
I mean, are there people who can actually, I hate to use such a crass phrase, make a living, but actually be professional poets?

15:03.078 --> 15:09.065
Or is it something that you need in addition to or as collateral to be too?

15:09.085 --> 15:13.249
Even the best poets who write a lot of poetry have to do other things.

15:13.970 --> 15:16.633
Donald Hall writes children's books,

15:17.558 --> 15:20.822
teaches, lectures some.

15:20.842 --> 15:24.847
They don't make much for the lectures, but they can be adjunct professor at a university for a while.

15:24.967 --> 15:32.457
But I don't know of a single poet, and I'm sure there are some, but I don't know any, who make a living just writing poetry.

15:32.817 --> 15:36.101
If it weren't for grants, and this is changing, by the way.

15:36.181 --> 15:43.330
Readings are beginning to bring poets more income, although it also runs the risk of exhausting them, because

15:43.900 --> 15:47.887
As you'll see when the eight films run, it's an exhaustive experience.

15:50.551 --> 15:53.836
Good poetry requires good audiences.

15:53.856 --> 16:05.115
The audience and the poet fuse in this experience so that the energy that's drained out of a poet in attending to the insatiable, emotional,

16:05.483 --> 16:09.269
magnetism of an audience is exhausting.

16:09.449 --> 16:14.658
And I see these poets actually give everything they have, and it's very tiny.

16:14.838 --> 16:16.281
But here's the interesting thing about poetry.

16:16.301 --> 16:17.903
This is the anomaly.

16:17.923 --> 16:29.723
The very fact that poets don't make a living from their poetry in part accounts for the powerful honesty of poets.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.487
They are not writing for pay.

16:33.547 --> 16:37.173
They're not like politicians going to be rewarded by the applause of the crowd.

16:37.254 --> 16:39.357
They're not like advertising trying to say something.

16:39.397 --> 16:45.728
There is no income attached to poetry, so poets are free to speak what is in their hearts.

16:45.748 --> 16:56.888
And they often do write the truth because they are liberated by penury.

16:57.830 --> 16:58.771
to speak truth.

16:58.831 --> 17:02.176
It's the most honest, as I say, it's the most honest language I hear today.

17:02.336 --> 17:10.648
And I don't know of anybody who's speaking the truth about America, better than poets.

17:10.708 --> 17:14.874
Adrian Rich's poems in here are discussions about what's happening to democracy.

17:15.315 --> 17:19.080
People who depend on public popularity don't speak the truth that often.

17:19.100 --> 17:22.024
That's why we don't get much of it from politicians.

17:22.545 --> 17:25.269
Did you do most of these interviews at the festival?

17:25.509 --> 17:27.752
That was really great.

17:28.103 --> 17:33.131
That was very convenient then, wasn't it?

17:33.171 --> 17:35.594
You really didn't have to be stretching the... Oh, thank you.

17:35.614 --> 17:36.596
Appreciate it.

17:36.616 --> 17:41.163
And it was fortunate, too, Nick, because I was just three months away from bypass surgery.

17:41.203 --> 17:45.970
The 15th of April, I had an unexpected brush with mortality.

17:46.070 --> 17:46.531
Thank you.

17:46.551 --> 17:49.495
Thirty minutes away from what they later said would have been a massive heart attack.

17:49.535 --> 17:53.301
So I had to bypass surgery, and...

17:54.209 --> 17:56.833
Three months later, I almost didn't do the series for two reasons.

17:56.913 --> 17:59.757
One, I hadn't raised the money for it by the time I had the bypass surgery.

18:00.077 --> 18:07.307
Then after I had the bypass surgery, I sort of lost my energy for a while and couldn't get out and raise the money.

18:08.088 --> 18:16.319
And my wife, who really designed this book, and I was sitting on the terrace of our home in New Jersey.

18:16.339 --> 18:21.246
We'd raised maybe two-thirds of the money before my operation for the Fortress Series and couldn't get the rest of it.

18:21.985 --> 18:24.027
And I just, I was ready to give up.

18:24.087 --> 18:29.273
I said, no, we were four weeks from the festival on the 18th of September.

18:29.293 --> 18:31.455
This was early August.

18:31.475 --> 18:34.998
And I've had some of these books, and I was reading through them.

18:35.018 --> 18:37.541
I told them at breakfast, I said, I'm not going to do the series.

18:37.561 --> 18:39.463
It's just, we can't get the money.

18:39.483 --> 18:40.364
It's going to be too much.

18:40.424 --> 18:41.225
I'm tired.

18:41.305 --> 18:42.867
I need to really recover.

18:43.747 --> 18:51.115
And I picked up Naomi's little, one of Naomi's little volumes that has in it The Art of Disappearing.

18:51.635 --> 19:05.154
And I read it, and then I came to this last line, sitting on the terrace of my house in New Jersey, walk around feeling like a leaf, know you could tumble any second, then decide what to do with your time.

19:06.016 --> 19:08.920
I read that to my wife, and she said, you know, we don't have much time.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.482
We ought to do that seriously.

19:10.502 --> 19:11.564
We've got to do that seriously.

19:11.784 --> 19:12.725
Well, I was inspired.

19:12.765 --> 19:18.013
I went to the phone, called a fellow I hadn't thought of in a good while who runs a small foundation in Boston,

19:18.483 --> 19:22.930
They came up with the extra $400,000, and we were able to do the series four weeks later.

19:23.411 --> 19:29.922
So I did go out there and interview 18 poets over the course of the festival.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.667
And they are part, although not all, of this book.

19:32.727 --> 19:37.254
Some of these poems, poets, are from my first series, The Power of the Word.

19:37.274 --> 19:45.047
Others are single hours I've done with Rita Dove and Donald Hall and Jane Kenyon and people like that.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.041
Oh, that's okay.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.783
That's the way I do my interviews.

19:48.823 --> 19:51.587
I just get to edit mine.

19:53.369 --> 20:00.537
I guess we talked about the imagery and the question that has to be asked, and I'm sure people are skirting around it.

20:00.557 --> 20:13.633
Here you are at the ADA, and it's kind of mildly ironic that in the same complex as Newt Gingrich, you know, who's doing a talk tomorrow, we know where he stands on the issue of

20:14.913 --> 20:18.579
public broadcasting, and I wonder, any comment?

20:18.599 --> 20:25.830
I mean, you talk about the need for his firm, recognizing and helping and nurturing poets, artists, whatever.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.492
Any comment?

20:27.512 --> 20:40.872
Well, Gingrich, I'm afraid, represents a kind of dark populism in American life, the fear of the artist, the fear of anything public.

20:40.932 --> 20:42.675
He and his allies are

20:43.027 --> 20:55.059
on a crusade against almost everything public in America, public lands, public libraries, public art, public broadcasting, public libraries.

20:55.920 --> 21:08.874
And that kind of dark populism has an angry edge to it that I see in Gingrich, and it reflects itself in his taking aim out of the public institutions in our country.

21:08.894 --> 21:09.615
I regret that.

21:09.695 --> 21:11.076
I'm saddened by that.

21:11.714 --> 21:16.579
he would allow everything to be determined by market forces only.

21:17.200 --> 21:37.502
And the sad truth is, no commercial television station, not even a cable station, would ever put a series on poets—put on a series on poets, if it weren't for public broadcasting, which is designed to—public broadcasting, which with all of its flaws—and we have many—is nonetheless

21:41.482 --> 21:44.065
The servant of goods the market will not deliver.

21:44.085 --> 21:48.889
If it were for public broadcasting, you wouldn't have the language of lying.

21:50.071 --> 21:51.492
Now, there are no public funds in this.

21:51.672 --> 21:54.535
I raised the money from private sources.

21:54.735 --> 21:56.637
You must make that point clear.

21:56.717 --> 22:00.281
The money, there's not a penny of public money in this series.

22:00.381 --> 22:10.611
The money came from Mutual of America, an insurance company, which understands the value of promoting the strategy of affirmation.

22:10.996 --> 22:18.347
affirming what's good in our society, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Gerbischhausen Foundation.

22:18.428 --> 22:32.329
So I raised the money from the private sector, and fortunately there is a public delivery system which recognizes the importance of language and the value of

22:32.815 --> 22:35.037
of this kind of community, and they will do it.

22:35.197 --> 22:39.401
But if New Gingrich has its way, there will be no place for the language of life.

22:39.681 --> 22:55.857
As you pointed out, this has been made possible by private support, but also, as you pointed out, it will be broadcast on public broadcasting stations, many of which get some support.

22:55.937 --> 22:56.837
Yeah.

22:56.857 --> 22:58.159
They are the delivery system.

22:58.179 --> 23:00.501
It's the kind of thing that would fill this thing up.

23:00.541 --> 23:01.742
Yeah, this would be...

23:02.178 --> 23:13.073
the series on the power of poetry, the significance in poetry, the applicability of poetry, all of this stuff that would be denied, I guess.

23:13.133 --> 23:15.015
I'm not trying to direct you in any way.

23:15.075 --> 23:19.542
Obviously, it's under his agenda.

23:19.562 --> 23:27.833
Under his agenda, corporations, media conglomerates will determine what the American people get to hear and see and watch.

23:29.395 --> 23:31.678
He would turn this all over to

23:33.667 --> 23:37.133
the tycoons of the media.

23:37.233 --> 23:43.104
You know, about 26 corporations own most of the newspapers and television stations in America.

23:43.124 --> 23:45.969
Tell me, I'm trying to get myself into it.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.633
It's amazing when you see 2,200 newspapers out there.

23:49.254 --> 23:50.917
It's not 2,200 individual newspapers.

23:50.937 --> 23:51.198
No.

23:51.218 --> 23:57.649
You know, you start fooling around with Gannett and all these others, and they really learn the personality of each one.

23:58.237 --> 24:04.447
And what a great joy it is to run across an independently owned newspaper like the South Bend Tribute.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.129
There are not many.

24:06.189 --> 24:07.351
There are not many left.

24:08.313 --> 24:12.219
And how wonderful it is, you know, to find a register guard and a chain.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.322
Well, nice.

24:14.582 --> 24:16.305
The Blade and Toledo.

24:16.325 --> 24:21.493
I don't mean to be into my stuff, but it's the same stuff.

24:22.722 --> 24:23.563
I don't have a watch.

24:23.583 --> 24:24.865
You'll have to tell me how we stand.

24:24.885 --> 24:27.469
And by the way, I've got about five more minutes.

24:27.489 --> 24:40.649
Gingrich will sell a lot of books because the right-wing radio shows are his propaganda machine, and they will push, push, push his books.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.692
I'm sure they will.

24:42.712 --> 24:44.795
We're talking $4.5 million.

24:44.815 --> 24:48.340
And the Christian Coalition will make sure that there are a lot of books bought.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.063
That's the way they sell Russian Paul's books.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.113
I'm sure.

24:51.133 --> 24:53.816
I mean, I can't imagine that this is an Oliver North book.

24:53.876 --> 24:54.957
It is.

24:56.158 --> 24:58.160
Let's see.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.482
I know you're a busy man.

24:59.622 --> 25:02.085
I appreciate you doing this.

25:02.525 --> 25:04.247
It means a lot to me and to this cause.

25:04.367 --> 25:05.328
It's good for me.

25:05.488 --> 25:12.436
And I think that in addition to the papers that take me every week, I am able to go out and do spot things.

25:12.656 --> 25:14.278
And I do have the list of the

25:14.613 --> 25:17.497
in the cities that are broadcasting.

25:17.517 --> 25:17.898
Good.

25:18.098 --> 25:21.804
Well, use anything from the introduction as if we talked about if you want to.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.788
And I guess is there anything that stands out in your mind?

25:24.808 --> 25:30.817
I mean, was there anything truly revelatory for you personally in any of these?

25:30.837 --> 25:32.520
The power of the performing poet.

25:33.361 --> 25:35.905
I hadn't seen much poetry performed when I was growing up.

25:36.286 --> 25:43.877
My teachers in high school and college would read poetry to us, but they were reading the poems of poets, not their own poems.

25:44.245 --> 25:51.894
And I read poetry a lot, but I've rarely had the chance to see poetry performed the way it is in the series.

25:52.935 --> 26:06.191
It's powerful when you have poetry accompanied by the blues or jazz or the didgeridoo, which is an aborigine instrument brought from Australia.

26:06.512 --> 26:09.375
And when Sekou Sandiata performs,

26:09.845 --> 26:25.062
he has an accompanist on the didgeridoo, and the sound, the coupling of language and music creates a wholly new experience, epiphany, in the viewer and the listener.

26:25.262 --> 26:27.765
That was a discovery to me.

26:27.785 --> 26:37.455
That, that, that, that, my answer to what said to me in an interview, poetry is music written for the human voice, and you see it's also written for the human ear.

26:38.396 --> 26:39.177
Well, one of you, one of the

26:39.511 --> 26:50.044
people that you interview, actually, I forget which one, but she says, I think it's a woman, she actually hears the, you hear the rhythms before you have the words.

26:50.064 --> 26:51.566
Yeah, hear the music before the words.

26:52.107 --> 26:53.609
Which is very interesting, isn't it?

26:53.629 --> 26:56.873
I know I love Shakespeare, and it's almost like going to an opera.

26:56.893 --> 27:07.166
You don't have to, generally speaking, no matter how many times I've read the plays, I have to read a play again before I go see it, just because it's very difficult, I think, to just go cold into it.

27:07.387 --> 27:09.349
But even if you don't know what's going on, the

27:10.308 --> 27:15.294
Poetry is just so magnificent, and it is like going through an opera.

27:15.795 --> 27:25.026
Sound has a meaning, apart from the words themselves.

27:26.588 --> 27:35.098
What we hear is often, like great music, the sound affecting our unconscious.

27:35.819 --> 27:40.264
So that sometimes you don't even understand what a poet is saying, but you know the poem.

27:40.717 --> 27:42.118
is speaking to you.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.320
Don't ask me how that happened.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.841
It does happen, though.

27:44.861 --> 27:47.064
And quickly, what's next for Bill Moyes?

27:47.564 --> 27:51.508
We're going to start production on two series.

27:51.909 --> 28:07.305
One is called Genesis, and it will be a ten-part series on the stories of Genesis, the stories of the Bible, with some of the most interesting people in the country who spend a lot of time thinking about the book of Genesis.

28:07.345 --> 28:09.106
These old stories still resonate.

28:09.867 --> 28:10.588
They still have

28:10.889 --> 28:12.971
powerful meaning in our time today.

28:12.991 --> 28:17.276
So sometime late next year, I'll have a 10-part series on PBS on the book of Genesis.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.418
Are you going to do this in the field there?

28:19.438 --> 28:21.620
It's going to be discussion, really, interviews.

28:22.061 --> 28:26.605
And finally, how are you enjoying the NBC thing working?

28:26.685 --> 28:37.116
I'm starting production on one other thing, and that's a five-part series called The Healing Arts, which will be a sequel to Healing in the Mind, which was a successful series I did and a good book.

28:37.636 --> 28:48.967
And it will look at how the arts, music, poetry, painting, dance, drama, all play a role in our individual and social well-being.

28:49.588 --> 28:50.929
How am I enjoying NBC?

28:50.969 --> 29:03.322
Well, I've taken leave of NBC because two months after I was there, the old, I began to have some symptoms that had happened prior to my bypass surgery.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.626
And so I went to the doctor and he gave me all the tests and he said,

29:07.673 --> 29:15.643
You need to go into a three-month cardiac rehabilitation program, which I'm in right now, four days a week, three hours a day.

29:16.444 --> 29:17.986
And I've taken leave in D.C.

29:18.026 --> 29:18.707
while I'm doing that.

29:19.828 --> 29:20.249
Thank you, sir.

29:20.289 --> 29:20.869
My pleasure.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.431
Would you kindly inscribe this for me?

29:22.471 --> 29:27.898
You bet.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.924
I'll have to ask my wife.

29:33.064 --> 29:34.506
Well, that's fine.

29:36.068 --> 29:36.769
It's beautiful.

29:41.423 --> 29:41.901
Bye.
