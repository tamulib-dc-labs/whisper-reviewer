WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:08.906
I asked you about word processing.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.267
That might be useful information.

00:10.988 --> 00:11.188
All right.

00:11.589 --> 00:18.276
Well, I was, I used an Oliveni portable type, I think, for 20 years.

00:18.296 --> 00:23.761
One of those nice things, looking like a can of, you know, sardine can, basically.

00:23.781 --> 00:30.949
And then I broke my wrist one year, and I couldn't use it, because you need two hands for the... I was all in plaster up the shoulders.

00:31.942 --> 00:36.206
And I was obliged to buy a computer.

00:36.226 --> 00:39.149
I had a little laptop, which I would use with one hand.

00:39.249 --> 00:46.816
And of course, I actually started to use those.

00:46.936 --> 00:49.359
Especially for writing, don't you think?

00:49.619 --> 00:49.779
Yeah.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.601
The ability to revise, I think.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.121
Absolutely.

00:52.441 --> 00:56.746
Because every time before, I had to... She had to make a mistake, right?

00:56.886 --> 00:57.646
Exactly.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.528
I'm that way, if I make a mistake.

00:59.648 --> 01:01.510
I don't like even looking at the page.

01:01.810 --> 01:02.932
And I throw it away.

01:02.952 --> 01:04.093
And that can take forever.

01:04.454 --> 01:04.694
Yeah.

01:05.235 --> 01:05.696
And it did.

01:06.156 --> 01:09.902
Especially if you're writing nonfiction.

01:12.586 --> 01:16.332
You're constantly revising, adding, you're getting new information.

01:16.632 --> 01:17.854
And you can always put it in.

01:18.495 --> 01:18.775
Yeah.

01:19.476 --> 01:20.338
And you can store it.

01:20.878 --> 01:23.683
I mean, you can scroll it, have a look at it.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.567
And the spelling checkers, you hate to admit, are wonderful.

01:26.727 --> 01:28.049
Do you have a spelling checker?

01:28.069 --> 01:29.131
No, I'm quite a good fellow.

01:29.772 --> 01:30.653
In fact, I'm a very

01:30.937 --> 01:39.190
Yeah, but I'm not talking about making mistakes and spelling so much as making typos that the machine will pick up for you.

01:39.370 --> 01:49.787
Well, the problem is, I tried one once and I started querying things that I put down because the word was French.

01:50.227 --> 01:50.408
Yeah.

01:51.289 --> 01:54.815
And so it turned off and flooded and everything.

01:54.895 --> 01:56.277
I'm not going to handle it.

01:56.297 --> 01:56.978
Yeah, that's right.

01:57.464 --> 01:59.728
You can actually get a bilingual one.

01:59.748 --> 02:03.013
You can get a bilingual one.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.876
But how does it matter, you see?

02:04.896 --> 02:08.040
How does it matter when you're switching to monologics?

02:08.121 --> 02:09.403
Well, you can borrow it to do that.

02:09.423 --> 02:19.078
I don't know what your software is, but you can just buy a French dictionary, and you can load a French dictionary if it's worth it.

02:19.398 --> 02:21.021
But if you're fine, who needs it?

02:21.041 --> 02:22.543
But for all those accents, though,

02:23.755 --> 02:30.745
I mean, I just use the old-fashioned way of looking it up in a picture.

02:31.186 --> 02:32.948
You do it in hand, right?

02:32.968 --> 02:33.690
Yeah.

02:33.870 --> 02:36.253
I just finished a book, which is being published this summer.

02:36.434 --> 02:38.837
It was my first book, a non-fiction book.

02:38.857 --> 02:42.182
And there were a lot of French phrases and words.

02:42.723 --> 02:47.710
And I actually did put in all the accents with the computer, which is really cool.

02:48.611 --> 02:51.015
I don't do this whenever.

02:52.036 --> 02:53.138
It took forever to do it.

02:53.472 --> 02:57.097
Anyway, tell me, you're quite a phenomenon.

02:58.259 --> 03:03.547
Have you come to terms with this experience that you've had over the last, what is it, seven years now?

03:03.567 --> 03:04.448
Not really, no.

03:04.749 --> 03:10.197
And it's still... I find this all to astonish me.

03:10.878 --> 03:17.348
And I just want this to get closer.

03:17.708 --> 03:22.315
No, because the thing was, it was never a deliberate attempt to...

03:23.948 --> 03:28.554
do anything other than really just write a book about something that intrigued me at the time.

03:28.574 --> 03:33.400
And the fact that it took off has surprised me, has surprised the publisher.

03:34.782 --> 03:40.690
And it's wonderful to have a book that a lot of people have enjoyed reading.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.793
There's no getting away from that.

03:43.173 --> 03:53.186
And nobody, no author, unless he's an arrogant liar, would deny the fact that it's very nice to have a book in a bestseller list.

03:53.206 --> 03:53.787
That's terrific.

03:54.509 --> 04:00.500
This I noticed, by the way, weighs in the Sunday of the New York Times.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.822
This is on the New York Times.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.787
They've told me that it's a threat.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.070
No, it's there.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.813
I get it a week in advance.

04:07.893 --> 04:08.775
I got it this morning.

04:08.795 --> 04:09.416
Oh, yeah?

04:10.317 --> 04:10.999
Well, wonderful.

04:11.119 --> 04:12.441
I buy the Times.

04:12.541 --> 04:13.223
Yeah, yeah.

04:14.305 --> 04:15.026
A week in advance.

04:15.046 --> 04:15.807
It's pretty high.

04:16.128 --> 04:18.232
It's about 156.

04:18.272 --> 04:18.492
Good God.

04:18.944 --> 04:21.346
Well, wonders will never cease, will I?

04:21.366 --> 04:23.008
I read you publish his weekly interview.

04:23.088 --> 04:38.542
I write occasional interviews with CW, and when you were working on this, you said, well, I'm working on a book about my dog, and I don't expect it to be, you don't expect, you didn't expect much in terms of... I didn't expect anything ever, to be quite honest with you.

04:38.582 --> 04:47.230
I mean, the day I finish a book and say I expect this to be on the bestseller list, I think it was probably the beginning of the long, slippery road down to oblivion.

04:48.273 --> 05:02.004
Because everything that's good that's happened to me in writing has come as a result of either accidents or perverse desire to do what I wanted to do rather than what I should do in commercial terms.

05:02.025 --> 05:09.691
Because that, the dog book is not... I mean, people weren't banging on the door and saying, what we'd really like you to do is a book about your dog.

05:10.412 --> 05:13.854
It is kind of brazen when you come right down.

05:13.874 --> 05:15.436
It's something... Well, it's frivolous.

05:15.896 --> 05:18.178
I'm essentially a rather frivolous person.

05:19.154 --> 05:22.819
And that's something I wanted to do for two or three years.

05:23.019 --> 05:27.546
I mean, was this dog-driven or, I mean, subject-driven?

05:29.088 --> 05:36.037
Well, I was always interested in an animal's eye view of the human condition.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.948
And obviously it's not a novel notion.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.473
But when we got this, it was rather peculiar dawn.

05:48.415 --> 05:59.087
He did seem to have such a bizarre character that I invested in, perhaps, with more opinions and literary ability than he may naturally possess.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.252
And it was just a great deal of fun to do.

06:03.873 --> 06:05.955
You know, it wasn't a hardship.

06:05.995 --> 06:08.438
I was working with a great artist, Ed Coren.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.461
That's a classic.

06:11.662 --> 06:16.768
But, I mean, one of the things I really wanted to do it for was that I'd, for years, have been wanting to work with Ed.

06:17.018 --> 06:21.123
because he's one of the few reasons I've subscribed to the New Yorker.

06:21.323 --> 06:23.405
Great difficulty over the oceans.

06:24.487 --> 06:38.503
There's one thing I found about the New Yorker is that the subscription department is avid to take the check, and then they're very tardy in sending the magazines, so I take out two subscriptions for every one set of magazines that ever comes to me.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.124
Have they changed?

06:39.865 --> 06:40.706
Have they?

06:40.966 --> 06:46.873
Well, it would be nice to think so, but I mean, I... You know, the Tina Browns,

06:47.157 --> 06:49.259
Are they more competent in the subscription area?

06:49.360 --> 06:52.523
Oh, well, they're really very business-oriented.

06:52.563 --> 06:54.546
Well, I gave up after about three years.

06:54.706 --> 06:59.391
I like it as much as I used to, frankly.

06:59.571 --> 07:11.225
The last time I tried was about three years ago, and I was saying to my publisher, I had problems with taking out a subscription, never seeing anything back, and he said, well, don't worry, I'll take it out in your name.

07:11.245 --> 07:12.046
So he took one out.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.869
I didn't trust that, so I took one out as well.

07:15.170 --> 07:19.915
And between the two of us, we got one magazine out of 52, whatever it was.

07:20.316 --> 07:25.702
Anyway, for years I've been looking at Ed Coren's work in the magazine.

07:25.722 --> 07:29.847
What I love about him is he's a very droll man.

07:29.907 --> 07:34.352
He's not just an illustrator, he's a very witty man.

07:34.372 --> 07:43.202
And the other thing when I started thinking about the book is that he has a shaggy style which exactly...

07:44.127 --> 08:12.447
corresponds to the nature of the dog he was a shaggy dog so when I got in touch with him I said would you be prepared to consider working together on this I'd like to meet the subjects they met and they circled each other no because I was in Long Island at the time and I was in Vermont and part of the reason I was in Long Island was because I didn't want him to have to

08:13.338 --> 08:14.199
go too far.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.025
That's a big deal, isn't it?

08:18.706 --> 08:24.936
Well, no, we'd rented a place for the winter because I knew I was going to be working on this and another project.

08:24.956 --> 08:26.899
Is this in the Hamptons, by the way?

08:26.919 --> 08:35.052
Because I have a, I write for a number of publications, one of which is this Hamptons magazine on Long Island.

08:35.092 --> 08:36.094
They take me every week.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.738
So this would be perfect for that.

08:39.055 --> 08:41.277
Well, the meeting occurred in the Hamptons.

08:41.357 --> 08:47.784
At some point, bring in a Hamptons connection for me at some point.

08:47.804 --> 08:49.546
Well, I mean, I can do it very easily.

08:49.606 --> 09:00.377
I mean, we rented a house in Amagansett, and Ed came down from Vermont, and the introduction was arranged, I think, underneath the dining table or something.

09:00.617 --> 09:04.341
And he said, well, I've looked at him, and I think I can possibly do something.

09:04.441 --> 09:05.582
And so I said, well, that's terrific.

09:05.602 --> 09:08.725
And I'll send you chapters as I do them.

09:09.262 --> 09:14.910
which I did, and then he sent drawings, and they were wonderful.

09:14.930 --> 09:19.877
And he said he was going to do 20, and he ended up doing 59 or 60 or something like that.

09:21.098 --> 09:29.690
And the curious thing about this project is that practically everybody involved in it, apart from myself, has got copious facial hair.

09:29.710 --> 09:31.833
I mean, a dog has got a beard and a moustache.

09:32.454 --> 09:34.417
My editor at Knopf has got a beard.

09:34.457 --> 09:36.940
My publisher, Sonny Mehta, has got a beard.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.435
Ed's got a, you know, a sort of moustache.

09:40.755 --> 09:45.702
I don't know what happens, but clearly it's got something, maybe something in there somewhere, I don't know.

09:46.223 --> 09:51.329
Maybe if you want to get published, you ought to grow facial hair.

09:51.349 --> 09:53.432
This is kind of a throwback to the old days, isn't it?

09:53.452 --> 09:57.257
We had these collaborations between writers and illustrators.

09:57.277 --> 10:04.446
I have to say, this has been the most trouble-free, painless, delightful experience of anything.

10:05.540 --> 10:10.205
what I've ever experienced as an artist or an illustrator.

10:11.065 --> 10:14.909
Because it was just a delight to open the ombudsman.

10:14.949 --> 10:16.871
He caught it every time, right?

10:16.971 --> 10:17.211
Yeah.

10:17.291 --> 10:18.473
And the nuances are there.

10:18.593 --> 10:20.735
I love that I'm signing the books.

10:20.775 --> 10:25.099
I mean, if I, anything to do with books and stuff, or he's autographing, you know.

10:25.119 --> 10:33.167
Well, the thing is, what Ed did very correctly, he divined the fact that it's a whole

10:34.058 --> 10:41.126
feeling about this as a little man walking around in a baggy fur suit, making comments on the rest of the people that we meet.

10:41.627 --> 10:44.149
And that's the way he's drawing the dog.

10:44.169 --> 10:45.010
He's just wonderful.

10:45.030 --> 10:47.533
Also, he's a very nice guy, socially.

10:48.094 --> 10:59.847
For yourself, characterizing this narrative and getting a voice, I mean, is this in your mind's eye the dog's voice, or is this

11:00.097 --> 11:04.203
Are you being a ventriloquist, of course, dear?

11:04.223 --> 11:12.955
No, well... I tried to distance myself as much as I could and just attend to the punctuation, but I've studied him.

11:12.975 --> 11:14.057
I think we work together.

11:14.097 --> 11:18.042
He comes to the office and sits down with me.

11:18.102 --> 11:22.028
So we've shared an office for seven years now.

11:22.048 --> 11:25.733
And he has his idiosyncrasies.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.374
He has a very...

11:26.624 --> 11:28.486
pervasive presence in the house.

11:28.646 --> 11:39.039
I suspect from the way he looks at my wife and I from time to time that he's got some fairly caustic opinions about the way we live, especially about our friends.

11:39.840 --> 11:44.605
And that's what I tried to work into the literary voice.

11:44.625 --> 11:45.326
Is that what it's called?

11:45.346 --> 11:47.889
The literary voice.

11:47.949 --> 11:52.254
I didn't want him to be cute because he's impersonal.

11:52.274 --> 11:52.875
He's not cute.

11:52.975 --> 11:54.657
I mean, he's there and he's

11:55.649 --> 12:00.335
engaging in many ways, but he's not one of those bandy dogs.

12:02.278 --> 12:13.312
You said that you never have any commercial expectations for a book, but on the other hand, maybe this is naivetea, but dog books and cat books.

12:13.332 --> 12:21.943
Well, no, you must make a distinction between the two, and this is something I have a friend in England who runs a

12:22.548 --> 12:27.474
uh, publishers called Cape, you know, Jonathan Cape, Tom Mashler.

12:27.494 --> 12:31.078
Well, one of his authors is a guy called Desmond Morris, who wrote a make-it-it.

12:31.940 --> 12:37.246
Uh, in one particularly productive year, Desmond Morris did two books.

12:37.346 --> 12:41.571
One was called Dog-watching, and one was called Cat-watching, right?

12:42.252 --> 12:46.477
The cat book sold tremendously well, the dog book disappeared.

12:46.497 --> 12:51.964
And I have a, I always have been of the opinion that, um,

12:53.193 --> 12:55.536
People with cats would buy anything about cats.

12:56.617 --> 12:59.019
But people with dogs may or may not, depending.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.962
But it's certainly not a sure thing.

13:02.223 --> 13:09.151
I mean, there isn't a musical about dogs, for instance, that has been running for lovely 20 years.

13:09.932 --> 13:14.196
And I don't think, I think cat people are different, very different.

13:14.216 --> 13:16.078
They are.

13:16.098 --> 13:20.043
We have both a cat, which is my father-in-law's cat.

13:20.063 --> 13:21.124
Well, he's found in Florida.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.472
But we have our lab, you know, our big black lab.

13:26.553 --> 13:26.994
She's just a dog.

13:28.035 --> 13:30.438
And, you know, I mean, it really is two different personalities.

13:30.458 --> 13:30.898
Oh, sure.

13:31.159 --> 13:32.861
And they appeal to different practices.

13:33.021 --> 13:33.682
Absolutely.

13:33.722 --> 13:49.761
I mean, I'm a dog person because what I find difficult, I've had a couple of cats, but what I find difficult about cats is their indifference, their self-sufficiency, and the fact that they get to places which you didn't know they could and rather wish they hadn't.

13:50.568 --> 13:58.898
whereas a dog is just a straightforward adulation on four legs.

13:59.599 --> 14:04.505
Thrilled to see wherever you are, whatever the circumstances, totally forgiving.

14:04.745 --> 14:05.847
Will go anywhere with you.

14:06.507 --> 14:11.213
A cat is a creature of place, I think, and a dog is a creature of people.

14:13.596 --> 14:17.040
So that's why, in the end, I always come down in favor of dogs.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.482
But I don't think of the literary

14:19.188 --> 14:19.809
proposition.

14:19.829 --> 14:24.333
If you had a cat book and a dog book, the smart money would go on the cat book.

14:24.353 --> 14:24.913
I think you're right.

14:25.253 --> 14:29.597
I did a piece, one of my earliest books years ago.

14:30.658 --> 14:32.019
It was a delightful book.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.402
It was by a cat veterinarian.

14:35.422 --> 14:38.725
He was 87 years old and he made house calls in Manhattan.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.866
His name was Dr. Commuti.

14:41.027 --> 14:44.570
And the title of his book was All My Patients Are Under the Bed.

14:47.253 --> 14:47.473
And I said,

14:47.740 --> 14:52.124
It's one of the most popular pieces I ever wrote.

14:52.484 --> 14:55.007
I wish I had all the newspapers in that I have now.

14:55.287 --> 14:56.428
I could have sold it everywhere.

14:56.528 --> 14:56.869
Really?

14:57.009 --> 14:58.210
It was just magnificent.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.631
Everybody loved this story.

14:59.811 --> 15:03.875
Well, I mean, look at a very nice guy I met a couple of years ago, Cleveland Dainbury.

15:03.895 --> 15:04.776
He's written about it.

15:04.956 --> 15:06.057
That's right.

15:06.097 --> 15:12.663
What he said, the first thing a cat does when it gets into some place, it always tries to figure out how to get out.

15:12.683 --> 15:16.667
Like he said, a cat's first instinct is to look for the ways of escaping.

15:17.238 --> 15:18.440
Never mind who's there.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.021
Oh, really?

15:19.141 --> 15:20.904
That's interesting.

15:21.504 --> 15:25.791
And if you look at a cat, it takes a cat a long time to be comfortable in a place.

15:25.811 --> 15:30.698
Well, you're supposed to rub butter on their paws to make them feel at home and all sorts of stuff, aren't you?

15:30.718 --> 15:33.442
A dog doesn't mind when you're there and there's a bit of food.

15:33.603 --> 15:36.527
A cat we have will only eat scallops.

15:36.547 --> 15:38.049
My wife has to get up.

15:38.129 --> 15:38.470
What?

15:38.830 --> 15:39.311
Scallops.

15:41.414 --> 15:41.514
What?

15:41.534 --> 15:41.895
Fresh.

15:42.348 --> 15:43.550
Oh, we got cat food.

15:43.570 --> 15:44.011
We buy them.

15:44.171 --> 15:46.976
Well, they drive out on Long Island every day.

15:47.016 --> 15:49.000
Well, we live, you know, Cape is a tough driver.

15:49.020 --> 15:51.163
We buy flows in Florida once night.

15:51.224 --> 15:52.205
They're not that expensive.

15:53.067 --> 15:56.032
And, you know, we take them out of the freezer.

15:56.052 --> 16:00.600
We put them in the micro for about 20 seconds on this nice little block, dice them up.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.964
And she will eat them, and she will protect us.

16:02.984 --> 16:05.469
I mean, if the dog is foolish enough to come near the cat.

16:06.130 --> 16:06.330
Yeah.

16:07.255 --> 16:10.578
The dog never wins at these battle for cats.

16:11.819 --> 16:14.522
Cats are more, I guess, cats are more cunning.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.444
I think they're smarter.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.888
Anyway, but it is a fun concept.

16:21.269 --> 16:26.173
I guess the details of his life, as we call it.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.134
They're fairly accurate.

16:27.234 --> 16:30.037
I mean, I know that he was abandoned, obviously.

16:30.057 --> 16:35.102
I'm pretty sure that he was thrown out of a car because he's had this phobia about

16:35.673 --> 16:40.099
You know, if you get anywhere near the car and open the trunk, he's in there.

16:40.119 --> 16:41.180
He doesn't want to be left behind.

16:41.200 --> 16:54.297
I know he was kicked when he was young because he's got a complete paranoia about feet, even naked feet, in the summer that reach out and touch and tickle him on the table.

16:55.138 --> 16:55.479
He's up a lot.

16:56.860 --> 17:02.127
And I think I know why he was abandoned, because when he got in, he was in a terrible physical condition.

17:02.468 --> 17:03.890
He was almost blind.

17:03.910 --> 17:04.971
He didn't have a sense of smell.

17:05.980 --> 17:11.626
and his hair was boring out, which we later found out because he had a thyroid deficiency.

17:12.046 --> 17:13.508
And he's supposed to be a hunting dog.

17:13.568 --> 17:16.751
A hunting dog who can't see and can't smell is not much of a deal.

17:16.891 --> 17:27.763
So I think in that unsentimental way that the French have for hunters anyway, he was just regarded as a piece of unnecessary equipment that was costing money.

17:27.943 --> 17:30.686
So he was just taken out and dumped somewhere.

17:30.706 --> 17:33.068
So that the early part of...

17:33.773 --> 17:35.394
I can't describe his life.

17:35.555 --> 17:40.419
That's probably fairly accurate when I made it up.

17:40.639 --> 17:51.708
But he has now become, rather than a hunting dog, he's just become a prince and a layabout.

17:51.829 --> 17:52.649
It's terrible.

17:52.669 --> 18:02.818
But does he sense your change in your, if you were a fortune, but I mean, the fact that your success is

18:04.705 --> 18:07.349
made you all something of celebrities?

18:08.030 --> 18:10.152
Well, yeah, he quite likes it.

18:10.413 --> 18:13.137
I mean, he's been on television.

18:14.258 --> 18:18.424
I think it was the Today Show or Good Morning America.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.527
They sent a team out.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.431
And in almost every shot, a dog is there.

18:24.232 --> 18:31.101
And he's been on the cover of magazines in Europe because every time anybody comes to the house with a camera, he gets his face in the way.

18:31.958 --> 18:39.948
I doubt very much that he considers this anything other than just a minor amusement, because he likes people.

18:39.989 --> 18:43.073
He'd much prefer to be with people and with dogs.

18:43.093 --> 18:44.134
And he's always in the middle.

18:44.194 --> 18:54.347
If there's half a dozen people come for a drink, you can bet that he's going to be right in the middle, hoping for maybe something to fall off the table.

18:54.427 --> 18:55.529
I think they enjoy that.

18:55.829 --> 18:59.434
They enjoy a sociable creature.

18:59.650 --> 19:05.918
Whereas a cat would probably go away and sit on the top of a bookshelf and look at you with a rather disdainful look.

19:05.938 --> 19:11.605
A dog is in there saying, yeah, all right, cocktails, drinks, food, canopies, yeah.

19:11.785 --> 19:13.807
Yeah, that's fun.

19:14.889 --> 19:23.439
Going back to the, I've got the details of your life have been well chronicled and published weekly.

19:23.459 --> 19:25.742
I don't know, any of them are the features that I've seen.

19:26.026 --> 19:27.748
Well, it's a pretty interesting story.

19:27.768 --> 19:37.378
You're an expatriate Englishman who spent some time in New York in the advertising business.

19:37.418 --> 19:39.180
Went back to London, I guess.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.983
Yeah, it was back and forth a bit.

19:42.143 --> 19:45.066
You became disenchanted with this?

19:46.428 --> 19:51.513
Well, it's a business that requires a great deal of boyish enthusiasm, I find, advertising.

19:51.533 --> 19:54.236
And for a while, I had a lot of it, because I thought it was great.

19:54.476 --> 19:54.917
I was lucky.

19:54.937 --> 19:55.898
I was in it in the

19:56.671 --> 19:59.254
mid-60s through to the end of the 70s.

19:59.895 --> 20:08.225
And that, I think, was the most fun that advertising has ever been, because it wasn't overburdened by research and respectability.

20:08.685 --> 20:16.134
If you had a great idea, you knew it was a wild idea, people would give it a go, rather than at the moment.

20:16.154 --> 20:25.465
I think what happens now is it's all research, you know, focus groups and pressure groups, and you can't say this because the women's movement would have a go at you.

20:25.485 --> 20:26.126
Correct.

20:26.146 --> 20:26.526
Yeah.

20:26.793 --> 20:32.382
And from what I gather now... You're trying to come up with a Frito Bandito, for instance.

20:32.402 --> 20:33.964
Oh, no, sorry, no, good God.

20:33.984 --> 20:40.014
And there was a fun, you know, the Nut and Honey ads just a couple of years ago, and they would say, what's for breakfast?

20:40.034 --> 20:45.422
And the guy would say, Nut and Honey, and they all point the guns at him like he was gay and making that.

20:45.763 --> 20:48.227
But that was on the air for about six plays.

20:49.228 --> 20:51.231
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:51.252 --> 20:53.355
And it was a cute ad.

20:53.375 --> 20:53.475
Yeah.

20:53.962 --> 20:58.287
Anything particularly memorable that you worked on that you can remember?

20:58.307 --> 20:59.228
I guess not really.

20:59.248 --> 21:12.522
I mean, I worked on the Hathaway account when I was very young, the one with the iPatch, and the British travel account, and Ollie Betty and Sonny Harrods in England, DP.

21:12.542 --> 21:13.182
I was all right.

21:13.202 --> 21:18.568
I mean, I think I was a reasonable copywriter, but the nature of advertising is that you get promoted beyond your

21:19.443 --> 21:22.187
level of competence.

21:22.568 --> 21:26.313
And after a while, it's not enough that you write ads and commercials.

21:26.874 --> 21:29.598
You've got to supervise other people writing ads and commercials.

21:29.618 --> 21:40.094
And if you don't make a complete pig's ear of it, then you get promoted above that to a board member and then take clients to lunch.

21:40.374 --> 21:42.658
And that I found very dull.

21:43.499 --> 21:48.927
I mean, it was administration and massage rather than writing.

21:49.565 --> 21:55.891
Was there anything that you learned from this experience that has influenced your writing at all?

21:55.911 --> 21:56.612
Oh, sure.

21:56.632 --> 22:04.379
I mean, advertising is a great business to learn the principles of direct, clean prose, like journalism must be.

22:04.799 --> 22:13.568
When you have to write to the point, you can't take your time about it, you can't have these lengthy digressions, you can't indulge yourself too much.

22:14.288 --> 22:18.272
You're on and off, and you better say what you have to say while you've got the

22:18.556 --> 22:20.658
audience's attention, if indeed you ever get it.

22:20.818 --> 22:25.904
And you really might be allowed to engage in the attention of the reader.

22:25.924 --> 22:26.024
Sure.

22:26.044 --> 22:35.694
I mean, my progression was really, although it was not deliberate, it was really quite interesting, I think, because I went from writing ads for adults to writing books for children.

22:35.794 --> 22:38.297
I think it was about the same.

22:38.317 --> 22:47.787
You've got about the same degree for attention span, advertising for adults who are not really reading the newspaper or watching TV to watch your work, you know,

22:48.138 --> 22:48.999
which is anything else.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.783
And kids have always got much more to do than just sit down and read a book.

22:53.744 --> 23:08.579
So I graduated from advertising to children's books, same principle, short words, short paragraphs, get to the point, get on with it, make it interesting, and illustrate it, make it visually interesting as well.

23:08.599 --> 23:09.360
That's interesting.

23:09.400 --> 23:16.828
You did have this background in children's books, and maybe that was in your mind when you started to engage in the choir for this book.

23:17.332 --> 23:19.315
Not really, no.

23:19.375 --> 23:25.582
I mean, that was really a manner of self-indulgence because I just admired him and I wanted to work with him.

23:25.602 --> 23:28.686
Did you ever work with an illustrator at all?

23:29.928 --> 23:30.409
No, I didn't.

23:30.469 --> 23:37.538
I only ever wanted to work, well, in this book, I only ever wanted to work with him because I thought he was absolutely the right man to do it.

23:37.578 --> 23:41.282
Had he not agreed, would the book have been illustrated, do you think?

23:41.302 --> 23:41.763
Maybe not.

23:43.024 --> 23:44.627
Would it have been written as a straightforward work?

23:44.807 --> 23:45.027
Yeah.

23:45.462 --> 23:48.226
I mean, it's infinitely better because of the illustrations, I think.

23:48.826 --> 23:59.720
I send out illustrations to my newspapers to take my stuff, and usually I send out a picture of the author, but in this case, it's almost so tempting.

23:59.740 --> 24:01.863
Oh, yeah, forget about the author.

24:01.883 --> 24:03.285
Damn this.

24:03.385 --> 24:04.827
This is wonderful.

24:04.867 --> 24:10.454
I can see the play that this will show in the papers.

24:11.215 --> 24:12.617
Well, the other thing about it, which

24:13.002 --> 24:19.588
again, is a fortunate by-product rather than any deliberate thing, is it reproduces well in newspapers, which, yeah.

24:19.848 --> 24:21.890
There's no half-towers there.

24:21.910 --> 24:22.030
No.

24:22.050 --> 24:35.262
I mean, if you've got some brilliant impressionistic person to do lyrical watercolours of a dog at play in the field of lavender, it's just looking like... Gorgeous in four colours and a six-colour... Yeah.

24:35.282 --> 24:39.085
But these are straight... Also, they work well in all sorts of sizes.

24:40.787 --> 24:42.368
But as I say, that's the sort of

24:42.938 --> 24:44.581
a byproduct of it all.

24:45.222 --> 24:52.533
I think the great strength of Ed's work is just funny.

24:54.477 --> 24:57.782
What time is your next gig, by the way?

24:57.882 --> 24:59.465
Oh, no, don't worry about that.

24:59.925 --> 25:03.331
You've been accused of writing a lot of plays.

25:03.351 --> 25:10.262
I know we get out of markets and the people down there always claim to

25:11.255 --> 25:23.436
to dread the summer invasion of all these people who come, and they claim to be angry with the people who have drawn these others to this place.

25:23.456 --> 25:23.556
Sure.

25:23.576 --> 25:25.279
Oh, yeah, I've had my share of that.

25:25.299 --> 25:34.495
Of course, now, going to France, as you did, and writing and comping this, occasioning this invasion,

25:35.133 --> 25:36.795
Tell me a little bit about that.

25:36.915 --> 25:39.097
Well, I find it very interesting.

25:39.197 --> 25:41.159
That is, in fact, has that happened?

25:41.179 --> 25:41.779
Oh, sure.

25:41.819 --> 25:47.324
You know, I've been pilloried in the British press for about two years now.

25:47.344 --> 25:48.165
Why should I follow that?

25:49.006 --> 25:50.047
Well, I'll tell you why.

25:50.067 --> 25:56.013
It's because it's a nice place to go for a free trip.

25:56.033 --> 26:01.798
So I've had journalists doing that thing of doorstepping you, you know, where they bang on the door without any kind of

26:02.268 --> 26:02.749
warning.

26:02.989 --> 26:03.830
Really?

26:03.970 --> 26:07.495
You open the door and there's a camera pointed in your face and a microphone.

26:08.677 --> 26:14.365
And they say, we want to talk to you about the fact that you've ruined Provence.

26:14.425 --> 26:18.911
So you say, well, look, I'm sorry, I'm working or I'm eating or I've got friends here or whatever.

26:19.231 --> 26:23.998
Well, if you don't give us an interview, we'll just have to, you know, wing it.

26:24.398 --> 26:26.301
Yeah.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.284
And they made a great deal of play about it.

26:28.324 --> 26:31.448
What interests me about it is, first of all, that

26:32.356 --> 26:42.529
The standard thing is you single-handedly, with two little books, have ruined the fast area of southern France.

26:42.970 --> 26:48.698
They never say in any specific way who I've ruined it for, where I've ruined it, or how I've ruined it.

26:49.118 --> 26:58.691
And so if I ask them about it, not just journalists, but people in general who sort of suck their teeth and say, dear, it's terrible, I say, well, what have I done?

26:58.731 --> 27:01.975
And they say, well, you've encouraged tourists.

27:02.377 --> 27:05.041
from there.

27:05.061 --> 27:05.681
Yeah.

27:05.701 --> 27:07.143
I think the locals don't complain about that.

27:07.163 --> 27:07.704
No, they don't.

27:08.205 --> 27:08.585
They don't.

27:08.966 --> 27:15.875
And so I say, well, yes, sir, I may have done that, but I feel I'm a tourist.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.477
And how about you?

27:17.517 --> 27:18.339
And they say, well, what do you mean?

27:18.979 --> 27:25.829
I say, well, do you ever go on vacation outside Chipping Sotbury or Gloucester or wherever you live?

27:26.369 --> 27:28.112
And they say, of course.

27:28.132 --> 27:29.534
I say, we are tourists.

27:29.554 --> 27:31.236
But the thing is, there's double standards.

27:31.756 --> 27:35.780
They are never tourists, nor are their families, nor are their friends.

27:35.901 --> 27:45.471
It's all those other bastards who are tourists who are mucking it up for, you know, the genteel people whose visit to a country is a sort of blessing.

27:47.053 --> 28:01.729
So there's a tremendous amount of hypocrisy involved and also a tremendous amount of ignorance and exaggeration because the truth of the matter is that Provence, or my part of it, has been very busy in July and August for at least the last 15 years

28:02.283 --> 28:09.873
mainly because Parisians found out about it about 15, 20 years ago, bought second homes there and came down every August.

28:09.893 --> 28:18.005
So August has never been a very quiet time down there in my memory, nor I suspect anybody else's memory.

28:18.025 --> 28:19.206
Yeah.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.611
I mean, they come down in August for the very good reason.

28:22.631 --> 28:27.658
The children are all on vacation, so they all come down on famille and they move in.

28:28.699 --> 28:30.842
How long does it take to get there?

28:30.862 --> 28:31.463
Well, it was about

28:31.763 --> 28:37.991
six, seven-hour drive, or four hours on the train, or an hour on the plane, so easy.

28:38.171 --> 28:46.281
So I've hardly sort of found this secret corner of France that nobody has ever heard of and blown it.

28:47.362 --> 28:52.449
People have known about it for many, many years and have been coming down for many years.

28:53.610 --> 28:59.037
But what I find so interesting is, and it happens, it crops up time and time and time again,

28:59.590 --> 29:05.257
This is double standard when one's talking about tourism, because we're all tourists.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.799
Well, you consider yourself a touristy?

29:06.819 --> 29:08.542
Sure, I'm a long-term tourist.

29:08.562 --> 29:10.684
I'm not a native of the country.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.246
I don't work the vines.

29:12.406 --> 29:18.014
I don't have a job in a provincial office.

29:18.174 --> 29:21.078
You certainly are.

29:21.458 --> 29:23.901
Indirectly, you contribute to the local economy.

29:24.282 --> 29:25.123
Quite a lot, yeah.

29:25.143 --> 29:27.606
I mean, as you said, I don't get any...

29:28.413 --> 29:32.178
from the people who run restaurants or bars or hotels.

29:33.460 --> 29:42.992
And a lot of the local farmers have suddenly started renting barns or places out for people who want to come down but can't afford a hotel.

29:43.553 --> 29:49.000
The other reason it's very difficult to say that the area has been ruined is that there aren't enough beds.

29:50.542 --> 29:51.604
Who's making these changes?

29:51.624 --> 29:52.585
The British press basically?

29:52.605 --> 29:56.310
It's basically the British expatriates and the British press.

29:57.117 --> 30:04.364
And occasionally you'll get people, I get run into people at book signings, and they say, well, I hope you're not going to write another book about it.

30:04.384 --> 30:07.788
Meanwhile, they're asking me to autograph the book, right?

30:07.808 --> 30:11.932
And asking me to tell them where they can go next.

30:11.952 --> 30:19.339
So there's this weird sort of... Well, you never saw yourself as a travel writer, and you're not a travel writer.

30:19.379 --> 30:20.521
I'm not a travel writer.

30:20.541 --> 30:25.926
But I mean, you certainly have this ancillary effect of...

30:26.952 --> 30:29.055
bringing people, making people travel.

30:29.135 --> 30:30.157
Well, apparently, yeah.

30:30.177 --> 30:33.222
I mean, I didn't have any idea.

30:33.242 --> 30:35.666
Wasn't your first thought actually to do a novel?

30:35.746 --> 30:40.133
Oh, yeah, no, I did, that was something that I did about six years later.

30:40.453 --> 30:43.137
The third book set here is a novel.

30:43.157 --> 30:45.601
Yeah, that's what I was going over there to do.

30:45.641 --> 30:46.462
Was that the book?

30:46.503 --> 30:48.045
Yeah, I just got distracted.

30:50.389 --> 30:52.572
Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on what

30:52.855 --> 30:57.279
And that's what happened by the circumstances of your being there with your place?

30:57.339 --> 30:58.380
Yeah, it was just novel.

30:58.460 --> 31:03.185
It was a great novelty, and I found that people were the thing, and what was going on was very interesting to me.

31:03.986 --> 31:07.509
And I couldn't concentrate on it in New York, partly because I didn't have anywhere to work.

31:08.109 --> 31:21.462
I wonder if a lot of the fascination people have is this story that you put out of, you know, you were in your late 30s, early 40s, you said the hell of a novel.

31:21.593 --> 31:23.296
Oh, yes.

31:23.416 --> 31:31.148
And the fact that you went to some place where the sun is wonderful and warm, and you escaped winter.

31:31.248 --> 31:33.912
Escapism, I think, is the thing.

31:33.932 --> 31:36.135
And why can't we talk to something like this?

31:36.155 --> 31:39.320
Well, there's an interesting thing that I heard or read about last week.

31:40.101 --> 31:41.884
There was some sort of survey done.

31:41.904 --> 31:44.929
A survey is always being done over here.

31:44.949 --> 31:50.217
And they polled a lot of the businessmen in there

31:51.226 --> 32:07.411
mid to late 30s, early 40s, and something like 50% of them said, what I'd really like to do is give it up and go and do something else, whether it was sailing a boat around the world or become a sheep farmer in Montana or do something, I don't know.

32:07.712 --> 32:15.664
But I suspect a large part of the popularity of those early books was that they thought, well, I

32:16.032 --> 32:17.694
I'd quite like to do something like that.

32:17.734 --> 32:19.115
And it was nice to have it documented.

32:19.336 --> 32:33.210
And it was also nice, I guess, to have it turn out pleasantly rather than in ignominy and failure, where, you know, you put your tail between your legs and you go back to work because it didn't work out.

32:33.230 --> 32:41.719
Of course, when the first book came out, I mean, it hadn't become, I don't know how many million copies of your books are in print now.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.002
Maybe you have the number, I don't know.

32:44.122 --> 32:44.823
I don't know.

32:44.843 --> 32:45.263
Quite a lot.

32:45.563 --> 32:51.759
But when that book was written, success was strictly a dream at that point.

32:51.819 --> 32:58.577
So that wasn't a factor in people's response, the fact that this guy

32:58.912 --> 32:59.813
went over here.

32:59.934 --> 33:04.401
No, but I mean, no, no, no, it wasn't a check at all.

33:04.681 --> 33:06.123
It wasn't a success.

33:06.244 --> 33:24.312
I think it was, it certainly wasn't financial success, but I think, oh, it does now, but I think what it was then was just some kind of personal success in contentment, if you like, because, you know,

33:24.764 --> 33:29.651
I wrote the book because I was happy there and I felt very affectionate about the people in the region.

33:30.472 --> 33:32.254
And I think that probably came through.

33:34.878 --> 33:39.545
And I think it was one of those things where money didn't enter into it in the beginning.

33:39.705 --> 33:46.314
Now people say, oh, well, you know, you knew it was going to happen and you were in advertising, so you knew how to put it together.

33:46.374 --> 33:47.816
Don't you wish you could print text?

33:47.936 --> 33:51.181
Oh, yeah, well, who'd be working in advertising if that's what it makes you do?

33:51.201 --> 33:53.404
You know, they'd all be out writing books and...

33:53.823 --> 33:54.964
living the life of Riley.

33:56.226 --> 33:59.910
Your illustrated sex manual for children is still in print.

34:00.971 --> 34:01.752
I know, it's wonderful.

34:02.894 --> 34:03.614
I've never seen it.

34:03.694 --> 34:04.996
I mean, is it... Oh, sure.

34:05.597 --> 34:10.482
Yeah, I mean, I get it thrust beneath my nose at signings from time to time.

34:10.703 --> 34:12.485
I know it's still sold 20, 30,000.

34:12.585 --> 34:16.830
Is that done with... Well, that was done on reflex.

34:16.930 --> 34:20.634
I mean, most of the good things that's happened to me have been accidental.

34:21.155 --> 34:23.037
And that was really because one of my

34:23.928 --> 34:31.917
children sort of slammed me up against the wall one day and asked me, I don't know, what an erection was or something.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.839
And I was like, this is not the real time to answer it.

34:33.859 --> 34:34.960
Why did you go to school?

34:35.481 --> 34:37.903
Well, yeah, I mean, I probably said that.

34:38.904 --> 34:47.073
But I did go and have a look at some books to see if I could get some sort of hold on an organised response.

34:48.134 --> 34:50.577
And I thought they were pretty dreadful.

34:50.597 --> 34:52.399
I mean, they were writing very medical books.

34:53.358 --> 35:11.245
I mean, cross-sections of uterus and things like that all over the place, although they were the sort of animalistic genres of sex education, you know, rabbits and squirrels copulating in the woods, and then they drew a parallel between that and humans.

35:11.265 --> 35:14.771
And so I just wanted to do a book that was as straightforward as possible.

35:15.532 --> 35:17.695
So it was a serious effort, in fact?

35:18.012 --> 35:31.008
No, I mean, all I did feel very strongly, and that's probably the advertising background, is that it had to be something, first of all, which was truthful.

35:31.108 --> 35:42.502
Secondly, which allowed the reader, in this case I thought of a six-year-old, seven-year-old child, to laugh, to get over the embarrassment of the subject.

35:42.522 --> 35:47.108
And thirdly, just to look decent, because all these other books look sort of

35:48.016 --> 35:52.142
they were being brown wrappers, you know, they were sort of slightly seedy.

35:52.263 --> 35:57.891
But what they were working really is, that's the side of the... Oh, that, certainly, yeah.

35:57.911 --> 35:58.813
That's a whole other story.

35:58.833 --> 36:06.525
Yeah, no, that was the idea of a friend of mine who was a cartoonist, and he wanted to have a strip cartoon on this character.

36:07.887 --> 36:14.277
He found that the laws of the British press, probably the same in America, bad, the, you know,

36:15.353 --> 36:19.840
the depiction of an upright member in their column.

36:19.860 --> 36:21.983
So he said, I can't ever do anything with him.

36:22.003 --> 36:25.108
I think what he's doing is a book.

36:25.128 --> 36:25.789
And he said, I don't know.

36:25.849 --> 36:26.730
I've got these drawings.

36:26.770 --> 36:30.496
So I did a framework for him and wrote the text for him.

36:30.996 --> 36:33.760
No, I think that, again, is not a new idea.

36:33.781 --> 36:43.896
I mean, people have been... The conflict between man's libido and his intellect has not been something that's only just been discovered.

36:43.916 --> 36:44.837
It was fun to do.

36:45.779 --> 36:50.546
Now, what are you working on now, might I ask?

36:50.566 --> 36:57.075
No, I'm working on another novel, and the idea has intrigued me for about two or three years.

36:58.117 --> 37:02.263
I'm fascinated by the truffle business in France, and I love truffles.

37:04.466 --> 37:08.251
I'm intrigued by the fact that it's such a murky business.

37:08.271 --> 37:15.702
You can never get anybody to admit how many they've got on their land, how many they sell, how much they've got for them.

37:16.272 --> 37:19.897
Well, partly because they are terrifically expensive there.

37:20.898 --> 37:26.346
Kyle's price last winter was like $700 a pound in Paris.

37:28.008 --> 37:34.317
And I've never yet met anybody that has anything to do with the truffle business that pays infant tax.

37:34.917 --> 37:35.799
Right.

37:37.481 --> 37:39.023
And the production of truffles

37:39.509 --> 37:53.624
Although this is very murky, because nobody has precise statistics, it's got to be several tons a year, maybe 20 tons a year, which is probably about five or six million dollars a year, and it's just being dissipated wrong way.

37:54.825 --> 37:58.789
And so this novel is about a truffle scan in France.

37:58.809 --> 37:59.370
Well, that's cute.

37:59.390 --> 38:05.636
Well, I think it's nice, because it allows me to do the research and eat it.

38:06.637 --> 38:07.238
That's what I said about that.

38:07.488 --> 38:16.296
Which is, which we haven't even touched on yet, but you certainly do have a passion for... I do like lunch, yeah.

38:16.516 --> 38:18.798
You do like lunch, and you like... And dinner, even.

38:18.818 --> 38:19.779
You like a good vintage.

38:20.079 --> 38:21.381
Yeah, yeah.

38:21.421 --> 38:26.445
There was even a wine that had the label of your first book.

38:27.046 --> 38:27.726
Oh, yeah.

38:27.746 --> 38:37.495
Well, that was a thing that, I don't know, they're still going, but I have a friend who runs a vineyard in Pertwee, a vineyard called Valgeronise.

38:38.032 --> 39:07.718
who's a very nice guy like Omer and he wanted to do a wine called a year in Provence and he does make very nice wine and it was about the time when they'd had the first lot of very severe floods in Provence and the villages were really decimated and began getting quite a lot of hardship so I'm very happy to even use that but what I would like is for a contribution every time a bottle is sold

39:07.917 --> 39:12.203
instead of me getting a royalty, give it, you know, set up a fund for flood relief.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.947
And so we did that.

39:16.549 --> 39:17.610
And I think it's done quite well.

39:17.650 --> 39:24.359
I know the village has got a lot of money out of it, and it's been able to do things which perhaps they wouldn't otherwise have done.

39:24.379 --> 39:30.328
And it's a great excuse to drink, which is one of the things that I feel life needs more of.

39:30.548 --> 39:37.317
So that if you have a bottle, you know you're doing some good to some poor guy who had his house...

39:37.718 --> 39:39.980
ruined up in religion.

39:40.000 --> 39:48.608
Some of these studies about how the longevity of the French do in some great measure to their appreciation for wine.

39:48.709 --> 39:56.016
I mean, this must have come as a... I guess that probably helped the books roll and hindered them.

39:56.116 --> 40:02.001
I mean, I personally don't... I think wine's got something to do with it, but a couple of interesting things I've noticed.

40:02.021 --> 40:06.966
And one is that you very rarely see truly obese French people.

40:08.228 --> 40:19.183
And the other thing that I think is the cause, really, is that they eat a very good, balanced diet and they take their time to do it.

40:19.223 --> 40:25.592
And they don't have snacks or they don't sit in their car and stuff things down or have a sandwich at the desk.

40:25.652 --> 40:33.223
They go out, they spend two hours, they devote themselves to a decent meal, a couple of glasses of wine, and they work a little later in the evening.

40:33.283 --> 40:34.725
But for those two hours or

40:35.110 --> 40:41.657
They'll have an argument about football or politics, but they're not on the phone.

40:41.678 --> 40:42.278
They do it right.

40:42.799 --> 40:43.840
I think they do it right.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.444
Well, I think statistics tend to support that.

40:48.545 --> 40:51.509
Food is very good, but it's also very good for you, most of it.

40:51.529 --> 40:54.052
There's a lot of olive oil used instead of fat.

40:54.072 --> 40:56.374
There's a lot of natural-grown stuff.

40:56.394 --> 41:00.259
They don't eat as much meat as the Anglo-Saxon food.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.003
And, of course, they have a couple of glasses, which

41:04.675 --> 41:13.949
medical science shows can dilute or dissolve the cholesterol if you take it.

41:14.089 --> 41:21.160
There was a very interesting study done of the dietary habits of 20 developed countries not long ago.

41:21.901 --> 41:31.456
And the most healthy diet from the heart point of view was Japan because they just eat fish and rice essentially.

41:31.476 --> 41:32.978
They've had some heart disease, you know.

41:33.835 --> 41:39.701
Well, of this study, you know, from 1 to 20.

41:39.721 --> 41:42.945
I think the study you're doing is the industrialization point.

41:42.965 --> 41:48.030
Yeah, from 1 to 20, it was Japan number one, France number two.

41:48.050 --> 41:53.336
Yeah, I mean, the Americans, the British, the Irish, and the Scots, the English, the Irish, and the Scots.

41:53.356 --> 41:58.622
Well, steaks, starch, fried food, all that stuff.

41:58.702 --> 42:00.484
And that I found fairly interesting.

42:00.564 --> 42:01.665
I mean, luckily,

42:02.135 --> 42:08.982
They didn't go in for the cirrhosis of the liver, because I suspect that France is up there amongst the leaders in that.

42:09.042 --> 42:11.906
But they don't drink a lot of hard liquor over there, do they?

42:11.966 --> 42:13.007
Not a huge amount.

42:13.147 --> 42:13.828
Mostly wine.

42:14.809 --> 42:20.575
Down where we are, they drink a lot of pastis, which is harder than most hard liquor, in fact.

42:20.595 --> 42:25.741
It's 45 degrees proof, which is stronger than whiskey or brandy.

42:26.341 --> 42:27.062
And yourself, you're

42:27.346 --> 42:29.769
You're a wine drinker, fundamentally.

42:29.849 --> 42:31.932
Yeah, I mean, I quite like anything.

42:31.952 --> 42:34.355
I like scotch every year.

42:34.475 --> 42:34.936
Yeah, I do.

42:34.996 --> 42:35.817
I like scotch.

42:35.997 --> 42:37.118
I like pasties.

42:37.319 --> 42:41.103
I like brandy and Calvador from Armagnac and stuff like that.

42:41.123 --> 42:42.245
But essentially, it's wine.

42:42.305 --> 42:49.354
I mean, I can do without the hard stuff, but I would be very hard-pressed to go through a day without wine.

42:49.594 --> 42:51.797
So you're in the mid-50s now, I guess.

42:52.578 --> 42:52.678
Yeah.

42:54.177 --> 42:57.020
20 years ago, you never could have predicted what you'd be doing today.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.361
No, no.

42:58.682 --> 43:02.806
I can't imagine life having turned out as kindly for me as it has done.

43:02.826 --> 43:03.987
That's really quite nice, isn't it?

43:04.067 --> 43:06.670
It's wonderful.

43:06.770 --> 43:19.122
It's wonderful, because I did have, for about 10 years after I left advertising, fairly rough patches financially, and it is a source of constant

43:20.030 --> 43:25.858
pleasure to make you realize that I've just been lucky enough to do what I want to do and live where I want to live and earn a living out of it.

43:26.059 --> 43:29.404
Do you have any particular person in mind as a reader?

43:29.744 --> 43:30.765
Do you visualize any?

43:30.986 --> 43:46.408
Well, yeah, I think my keenest critic, well, not my keenest critic of the work, there are many keener out there, I'm sure, but a very good editor and a good critic is my wife, and I show her the stuff that I write every week or every day or whenever.

43:47.688 --> 43:52.395
And if she doesn't want to throw up when she's read it, I suspect that it's got some merit.

43:52.616 --> 43:56.982
And if she actually says, well, that's good, then I think it's probably got enough merit to send to the publisher.

43:57.002 --> 44:00.067
So I write for her as much as for anybody else.

44:00.087 --> 44:05.656
Because in the end, all those people say, well, I've got my audience.

44:05.736 --> 44:09.462
You're writing for one person at a time.

44:10.022 --> 44:12.987
And Jenny's the person that I write for, essentially.

44:13.220 --> 44:16.345
And I'm told she edits herself out as you translate it.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.847
Oh, yeah.

44:18.508 --> 44:25.578
I got these awful letters when the first book came out from the feminist lobby in America.

44:25.598 --> 44:26.800
And they said, I think it's disgraceful.

44:26.820 --> 44:28.863
You're treating your wife like a piece of furniture.

44:28.903 --> 44:29.804
You never mention her.

44:29.824 --> 44:31.306
You never talk about her.

44:31.667 --> 44:36.334
She's just some sort of shadowy presence that supplies food.

44:37.736 --> 44:41.421
And I had this form letter done eventually because

44:42.076 --> 44:46.141
Actually, what had happened was I wrote a lot about her, and she just wanted me to take it out, so I took it out.

44:46.581 --> 44:49.184
But she said, it makes me feel embarrassed.

44:49.204 --> 44:50.486
And I said, OK, well, I'll take it out.

44:51.146 --> 44:58.715
So I had to do all these letters to people saying, you know, I'm bowing to the wishes of my lady.

44:58.755 --> 44:58.995
Why?

44:59.816 --> 45:01.879
I don't know if they believed it or not, but it was true.

45:02.780 --> 45:07.425
But you have no idea the virulence of some of the letters.

45:08.418 --> 45:12.924
And this was six, seven years ago, and I didn't think I'd done anything particularly insulting.

45:13.565 --> 45:16.189
And I hadn't really mentioned much about myself either.

45:16.209 --> 45:20.735
I'd just been up there as a necessary observer for events.

45:20.755 --> 45:21.276
So there we are.

45:21.296 --> 45:22.998
America's a strange and wonderful place.

45:23.759 --> 45:33.533
And to just repeat something you said in other interviews, I guess the original attraction to Provence was the warmer climate.

45:33.553 --> 45:35.196
Well, it's a combination of things.

45:35.576 --> 45:37.439
It is the climate.

45:37.519 --> 45:37.699
Well,

45:38.793 --> 45:40.555
It's the light.

45:40.575 --> 45:50.767
We both love France and the French, which many people don't, with all their quirks and their arrogance and their chauvinism and all this other stuff.

45:50.787 --> 45:53.349
We don't quite find them delightful.

45:53.910 --> 46:04.342
There's the emptiness of it, which is very nice, and which, despite, you may read, apart from July and August, it's still an empty place.

46:04.362 --> 46:05.323
The food, the drink,

46:05.928 --> 46:08.451
scenery, the air, the light, all those things.

46:08.972 --> 46:12.977
We just fell in love with it when we first went home on vacation and that was that.

46:12.997 --> 46:16.381
That's one of those places you either take a shine to or you don't.

46:16.401 --> 46:20.265
And was it a fairly inexpensive place to live when you first went there?

46:20.286 --> 46:22.028
Certain things are and certain things aren't.

46:22.048 --> 46:26.053
I mean, you can eat very well, very reasonably there.

46:26.673 --> 46:33.842
The produce is, if you eat the produce of the season and you don't want raspberries in December or something like that, you can live

46:34.548 --> 46:36.931
The wine's good and cheap.

46:36.951 --> 46:38.113
The food's good and cheap.

46:40.115 --> 46:41.437
Certain things are very expensive.

46:41.477 --> 46:44.602
Electricity is probably about five times what it is in the States.

46:44.622 --> 46:48.847
The same bill is at least four times what it is in the States.

46:48.987 --> 46:50.369
Income tax is very high.

46:50.429 --> 46:56.277
I mean, most Americans, when I tell them what I pay in income tax, they just don't believe it.

46:57.098 --> 47:00.623
Because it's sort of 60, 65 that carries, yeah.

47:01.042 --> 47:04.647
That's why a lot of whiteys move to Ireland.

47:04.667 --> 47:05.207
Right.

47:06.449 --> 47:07.871
It's not an expensive place.

47:07.891 --> 47:14.700
The property is quite expensive, although I wouldn't say any more expensive than any nice suburb.

47:14.760 --> 47:17.223
Oh, yeah, well, I've been living there.

47:17.243 --> 47:20.307
I mean, I've got a carte de saison and all that stuff.

47:20.327 --> 47:22.450
Your citizenship is still UK?

47:22.550 --> 47:25.774
Yes, but, I mean, the French have a fine disdain for all of that.

47:25.874 --> 47:28.197
I say, well, you're living here, which is reasonable.

47:28.396 --> 47:31.060
And you pay French taxes, which is also reasonable.

47:31.260 --> 47:35.927
The taxes themselves may be fairly unreasonable, but... But the principle is sound.

47:35.947 --> 47:37.949
The principle is sound, I think, yeah.

47:38.130 --> 47:42.656
And then, you know, this is what you pay for the privilege.

47:42.676 --> 47:44.579
I think every country does that in one form or another.

47:44.619 --> 47:44.939
Sure.

47:45.159 --> 47:52.750
Now, the other interesting thing is that everybody in France, everybody that I know down there...

47:53.725 --> 47:58.391
whether they do it or not, but they all say, oh, you just shouldn't pay what they ask.

47:58.431 --> 48:03.618
You go and negotiate, you take the tax inspector out for lunch and say.

48:04.459 --> 48:05.481
Apparently, yeah.

48:05.601 --> 48:09.706
I've never tried it, but they say, and if that doesn't work, they say you just cheat.

48:09.726 --> 48:12.130
You'd be tempting, well, you know.

48:12.150 --> 48:14.513
And there is, undoubtedly, a great deal of cheating.

48:14.773 --> 48:17.377
Well, no, there's lots of cheating on those right here.

48:17.397 --> 48:17.497
Yeah.

48:18.618 --> 48:22.163
But, no, I mean, that's very high.

48:22.885 --> 48:26.389
And things like the sales tax of 15, 18%.

48:27.871 --> 48:33.097
But the only thing is that about 40% of the French labor force is a bureaucracy.

48:33.117 --> 48:34.879
I mean, it's hired by government.

48:34.939 --> 48:37.182
Plus, you know, you're making a good living, you're enjoying yourself.

48:37.222 --> 48:37.522
Sure.

48:38.123 --> 48:39.444
There's money in the bank, I'm sure.

48:39.544 --> 48:39.785
Yeah.

48:39.965 --> 48:41.126
How much do you need, frankly?

48:41.146 --> 48:42.828
You can only eat so much a day.

48:42.968 --> 48:44.450
You can only drive one car at a time.

48:44.530 --> 48:46.733
You can only live in one house at a time.

48:46.753 --> 48:48.855
We have no particularly expensive hobbies.

48:49.276 --> 48:51.238
We don't want to have racehorses or yachts or

48:52.130 --> 49:00.144
The only thing I've noticed as a result of our improved financial circumstances is that we buy better wine than we used to, and that's about it.

49:00.485 --> 49:03.210
I'm always looking for the kicker for my story.

49:03.230 --> 49:06.035
You know, the last spread.

49:06.055 --> 49:07.076
I think you just gave it to me.

49:07.096 --> 49:08.559
That's about it, though.

49:08.579 --> 49:10.643
I think we've got a lot of stuff here for my interview.

49:11.043 --> 49:11.324
Good.

49:11.384 --> 49:13.648
Let me shut this up.
