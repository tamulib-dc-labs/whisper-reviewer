WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:06.460
And your name is pronounced Zeek.

00:06.480 --> 00:07.281
Okay.

00:07.301 --> 00:11.226
But it's spelled for the shape of C-A-C-H.

00:11.806 --> 00:18.073
And if you could just give me a—why don't we just enter into conversation about what you do here?

00:18.093 --> 00:18.193
Okay.

00:19.154 --> 00:24.440
Well, my official title is Director of Electronic Programs, and this gives me a good deal of freedom of movement.

00:25.902 --> 00:31.388
Pertinent to what I take to be your interest, electronic libraries of the future, perhaps.

00:31.705 --> 00:36.551
I should say that I guess I was there at the beginning.

00:37.352 --> 00:44.582
You were just also interested in how it might relate to print culture, too.

00:45.643 --> 00:46.104
Ah, yes.

00:46.124 --> 00:47.606
But, you know, all of the elements.

00:47.626 --> 01:01.003
Well, I have the distinction of having been mentioned by Sven Berkertz in Gutenberg Elegies as an apparently sensible person who was sort of knocked a little bit

01:02.030 --> 01:07.023
off-center by the impact of electronic things and electronic enthusiasms.

01:08.046 --> 01:10.813
I don't know if that's accurate or not.

01:10.853 --> 01:11.936
You can make that judgment.

01:12.718 --> 01:16.849
In any event, here at the library we— But do you like their characterization?

01:17.521 --> 01:19.384
Well, I like the sensible part.

01:19.764 --> 01:23.450
As it happens, I am also a great book lover and collector.

01:24.011 --> 01:24.231
Oh, really?

01:24.251 --> 01:32.444
I have several thousand volumes in my own private library and some special interests like Washington history books and so on, history of Washington, D.C.

01:32.484 --> 01:33.044
books and others.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.413
And on the other hand— That's the primary collection?

01:39.534 --> 01:39.995
Of my own?

01:40.656 --> 01:40.756
Yeah.

01:40.776 --> 01:43.360
No, actually—well, I have several.

01:43.762 --> 01:59.482
One of them, for instance, is 20th century English novelists, and I have very extensive collections of first printings and editions and so on, and book jackets of a number of what I believe to be the best English authors.

01:59.502 --> 02:02.867
But in any event, it's wide-ranging and eclectic.

02:03.047 --> 02:05.450
It's a sentence anyway, believe it or not for me.

02:05.550 --> 02:06.631
I'm interested in that.

02:06.652 --> 02:07.052
Go ahead.

02:07.555 --> 02:15.065
And have long had an interest in books in all their forms, and even considered being a rare book librarian at one point.

02:15.806 --> 02:29.665
On the other hand, I spend a lot of time online right now, and am astonished by the kinds of information, range of information, that you can find, quote unquote, freely available on the internet.

02:30.809 --> 02:33.712
Information is the key word, too, isn't it?

02:33.732 --> 02:33.872
It is.

02:33.972 --> 02:34.613
It's a key word.

02:34.833 --> 02:35.974
It is very much so.

02:36.675 --> 02:43.622
So that, for instance, I was highly interested in a Jane Austen site, which is run out of the University of Texas.

02:44.763 --> 02:59.618
There is a Jane Austen scholar there, a graduate student, I think, who perhaps—I'm not sure how this site came to exist—decided in the course of his graduate labors to produce this extensive Jane Austen site with

03:00.340 --> 03:09.428
trillions of hyperlinks and so on between the names of characters, for instance, and a description of what that character is, the place in the novel.

03:09.448 --> 03:13.392
I was thinking of Pride and Prejudice, which he's done this to considerably.

03:15.294 --> 03:27.225
Background information, there are links to all the names of the houses and everything that you can think of, so that instead of having an incredibly, probably overly footnoted

03:27.661 --> 03:32.708
scholarly text based on the text of Pride and Prejudice.

03:33.950 --> 03:40.760
You have a worldwide website available to everyone who has an interest that allows that.

03:40.780 --> 03:52.116
This is sort of approaching a work of art as something that needs all sorts of information attached to it for various scholarly and other purposes.

03:52.754 --> 04:19.960
One of the things in my collection is some of the old, very scholarly editions of Boswell's Life of Johnson, four volumes, six volumes all told, of the life and the other Boswell works relating to Johnson, which have the text as sort of a little trickle of original Boswell text at the top of these pages, which have these vast collections of footnotes.

04:20.412 --> 04:22.996
filling most of the rest of the page, page after page.

04:23.036 --> 04:27.303
And I guess I'm strange enough to enjoy that sort of thing.

04:27.323 --> 04:39.902
I just sort of enjoy the byways of scholarship and what, in that case, Birkbeck Hill and other Johnson scholars found out about all the people mentioned in that text.

04:39.943 --> 04:47.955
Well, it's sort of my own personal interest in that kind of scholarly presentation, a classic work,

04:48.290 --> 05:03.248
associated with quantities of scholarly research sort of easily accessible about the original classic work, which causes me to find intriguing and interesting what this person at the University of Texas did with Jane Austen.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.111
However, all that essentially is information.

05:06.131 --> 05:17.464
It isn't sitting down at a screen to read a piece of literature and just enjoying it as literature as opposed to as a subject of scholarly research.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.145
Have you ever tried that?

05:18.884 --> 05:22.089
I have, as a matter of fact, I have tried that.

05:22.149 --> 05:31.364
Not too long ago I got out a tape recording of Henry James' The American, which I had never read before.

05:32.566 --> 05:45.567
And I was reading it back, I was rather listening to it, as I drove back and forth to work, and became so engrossed in the story that the reading was absolutely appalling.

05:45.867 --> 05:55.876
But somehow, James managed to penetrate through that narrator and hook my interest so that I wanted to just read it.

05:55.896 --> 06:13.512
And as it happens, it wasn't convenient for me to get to the library or a bookstore and buy it, and so one night I just sat down at my computer and got off the American, the original text, and tried to find some things which I didn't remember quite well.

06:13.829 --> 06:21.117
No, I just checked one of the big indexing services like Altafista or Hotbot or whatever it was.

06:21.177 --> 06:23.360
So this stuff is easily available.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.140
It's online, in other words.

06:24.160 --> 06:24.741
Much of it, yeah.

06:24.761 --> 06:35.673
There are large numbers of scholarly works, I mean that's classic works of literature and philosophy and all sorts of things, which are available in full text on the NAM.

06:36.534 --> 06:39.938
And I can show you some of those if you're interested.

06:40.593 --> 06:43.897
I wouldn't mind trying even to look up to some of them myself at home, you know.

06:43.977 --> 06:55.291
And I think that my response to this is pretty much universal at present, which is that this is a very clunky and unsatisfactory way to read large quantities.

06:55.532 --> 06:57.154
Did you read the whole book, by the way, by the way?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.577
Oh, no, no, no, I did not, by no means.

06:59.657 --> 07:02.440
No, I mostly just heard the rest of it in my car.

07:03.441 --> 07:05.904
And you'd pick up the book afterwards.

07:06.105 --> 07:08.828
Okay, that anticipates the question.

07:09.196 --> 07:38.477
you did finally go to the printed text yes that's correct and I think most people would do that when they have to when they're interested in reading something for the literary the kinds of pleasures that classics of literature can give you or certain other kinds of things obviously art books for instance are things which are probably well presented in print are uniquely well presented in print form although it is also the case that there are wonderful collections of images of

07:39.115 --> 07:41.778
of painters available.

07:41.798 --> 07:45.002
There's something called Net Museum available on the web.

07:45.703 --> 07:52.091
As a matter of fact, that's a printout of a Durer that I got made just last Sunday at my home, using my home printer.

07:52.111 --> 07:52.512
That one down there?

07:52.532 --> 07:53.333
Yeah, that one right there.

07:53.353 --> 07:54.514
Really?

07:55.155 --> 07:56.196
Wow.

07:56.216 --> 07:59.561
And there's something like twenty-five in that same site.

07:59.581 --> 08:07.030
There's something like twenty-five of the thirty-five or so existing Vermeers and beautifully reproduced.

08:08.056 --> 08:22.170
And there's a certain amount of text associated with them, but it's still a different experience from having a beautiful, large, well-produced art book in your lap or on your table.

08:23.191 --> 08:26.294
So, there are many things one can do even now on the web.

08:26.774 --> 08:37.945
One of them tends not to be the reading of classical texts at length.

08:38.785 --> 08:44.771
I think that the web is certainly supreme in offering bits of information.

08:48.294 --> 08:55.041
John and I were doing some business with Encyclopedia Britannica, which now has Joe Esposito.

08:55.181 --> 08:57.844
I don't know if you know him as president.

08:59.025 --> 09:07.273
And Britannica is one of those companies which is really—don't please quote me.

09:07.675 --> 09:17.770
I think in crisis because of recent developments, because of the facility with which networks, and in particular the web, can provide information.

09:18.811 --> 09:22.757
That's one of those instances where the net is going to be superior.

09:22.777 --> 09:23.338
Oh, absolutely.

09:23.358 --> 09:25.941
The OED, for instance, is another example.

09:26.182 --> 09:31.490
Yeah, and that has been available on CD-ROM, as you know.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.594
In fact, the second edition is available on one CD-ROM, the first.

09:34.810 --> 09:37.813
edition was originally issued as two, which was clunky.

09:38.714 --> 09:43.398
And originally they were selling the CD for $8.95 or something.

09:44.098 --> 09:49.904
Just recently they brought down the price in half, and now it's, I think, $4.95, but you can often get it for $3.95.

09:50.684 --> 09:53.067
Think of all the constant supplements they had to do.

09:53.127 --> 09:55.469
I mean, these things were almost obsolete the day they hit them.

09:55.489 --> 09:55.889
That's true.

09:56.550 --> 10:04.497
And they are intending to get out a full new edition of it, and by full I mean fully revised, as you may know, the way they did the

10:04.865 --> 10:12.877
Even the updated so-called second edition, it basically was the old text plus supplements patched on to the end.

10:13.377 --> 10:15.380
It wasn't rethinking and reviewing.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.824
Which I own and love, but... Yes, oh, I do too.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.607
I have two copies of it.

10:20.428 --> 10:22.110
We're having a slight emergency.

10:22.551 --> 10:27.378
Why don't you... And I had interrupted you.

10:27.398 --> 10:30.923
You were about to tell me something about the Encyclopedia Botanica.

10:32.675 --> 10:37.263
According to news reports, sales have really tailed off in recent times.

10:39.106 --> 10:47.199
Joe is a very smart guy, and he has tried to figure out how to deal with this new circumstance.

10:47.219 --> 10:49.543
As you know, there's a tremendous overhead at the Britannic.

10:49.563 --> 10:56.715
It is a serious scholarly publication, and it requires a lot of money to keep it up to date.

10:56.956 --> 10:57.737
It's a vast work.

10:58.696 --> 11:03.302
And so they need big sales of some kind in order to support it.

11:03.782 --> 11:07.447
In any event, he did put out a CD-ROM, which was not well received.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.953
The software associated with it was not particularly effective.

11:12.473 --> 11:22.746
He put out a second edition of it about a year ago, which has received better reviews, but the price is quite high, and most of the reviews have

11:23.992 --> 11:36.948
been favorable to, obviously, the content and to a certain degree to the interface, but have said the price is way out of line when you think that it's easy to buy for under fifty dollars.

11:36.988 --> 11:47.721
In my case, I bought two good encyclopedias, not Britannicas, but two good reputable encyclopedias on CD-ROM for fifteen dollars each.

11:48.292 --> 11:54.700
Well, $15 for one and $28 for the other, but the other includes a whole range of other reference works associated with it.

11:55.421 --> 12:09.439
And you can't, you know, you can't sell a Botanica for whatever it is, $400 or $500 on CD-ROM when you can get something that's not approachable, but is quite acceptable, isn't it?

12:09.459 --> 12:10.420
Functional.

12:10.901 --> 12:14.485
And which has all of the bells and whistles, which now people seem to

12:15.224 --> 12:17.707
either want or think they want it.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.972
Well, the CD-ROM apparently has to give them something beyond a text, I guess.

12:22.032 --> 12:22.552
Exactly.

12:22.993 --> 12:23.694
Well, and they do.

12:24.154 --> 12:26.817
And it's not—I don't mean to trivialize that.

12:26.857 --> 12:29.760
It is nice to be able to hear bird calls and to hear a lion.

12:30.782 --> 12:32.904
That's the only thing I can see out of that Audubon book, actually.

12:32.924 --> 12:38.250
Well, actually, I can show you one I've got right here, which— And if it's the new Knopf one, I have it.

12:38.430 --> 12:39.812
No, it's not that.

12:39.992 --> 12:43.476
It's rather—actually, it's rather a low-grade one.

12:44.401 --> 12:47.346
the Infopedia, but I like it very much.

12:48.228 --> 12:50.211
Oh, here's another thing that might interest you.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.054
AuthorWorks.

12:52.254 --> 12:53.737
This is actually a joint product.

12:53.777 --> 12:54.799
This is just one.

12:54.839 --> 12:56.782
The other is classic American authors.

12:57.523 --> 12:59.106
Which is that?

12:59.126 --> 13:02.232
Oh, it's Scott, isn't it Scott Forsman?

13:02.252 --> 13:04.455
Yeah.

13:04.475 --> 13:05.918
AuthorWorks, it's called, right?

13:05.938 --> 13:06.038
Yeah.

13:13.797 --> 13:15.942
And is this authors doing their own?

13:16.924 --> 13:19.310
Actually, it's an interesting array of things.

13:19.471 --> 13:21.636
If we had time, I could show you this too.

13:21.736 --> 13:23.761
I was curious.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.327
I was skeptical as to the value of it.

13:26.928 --> 13:30.557
I got into this, though, and was looking at the Emily Dickinson stuff that they had.

13:31.010 --> 13:35.695
And I could see that for, particularly for a high schooler, but even for me, it was highly interesting.

13:35.715 --> 13:44.084
They had lots of pictures of all the people she knew and of her house, but then also good, I think, sound text, quoting reviews and so on.

13:48.228 --> 13:54.075
Well, you know, obviously, you get things like this, Harry Houdini from A Straightjacket.

13:55.596 --> 14:00.021
The name Houdini meant startling, beweltering, impossible things similar to this.

14:01.790 --> 14:09.399
With the authentic sound there.

14:10.100 --> 14:14.324
Yeah, right.

14:14.485 --> 14:24.056
And that's kind of nice, but then for somebody like Fred Astaire, it seems to me it's very nice.

14:25.177 --> 14:26.178
Let's see if I can show you this.

14:26.739 --> 14:30.463
This is called Info... This is Infopedia, yeah, it's up here at the top.

14:32.047 --> 14:55.557
So, you know, you can read about Fred Astaire, but when you can actually see him dance—

14:59.080 --> 15:00.363
That's great.

15:00.383 --> 15:02.768
No book's ever going to do that.

15:06.676 --> 15:07.357
Yeah, exactly.

15:07.377 --> 15:10.584
I have to watch this because I just did it.

15:19.181 --> 15:19.502
Yeah, I love it.

15:20.495 --> 15:24.059
Which note is that from, just that particular piece?

15:24.079 --> 15:24.920
Pauline Goddard.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.101
As a matter of fact, I don't know.

15:26.141 --> 15:27.282
It may say here somewhere.

15:27.483 --> 15:29.345
Well, it's Fred Astaire and Pauline Goddard.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.228
That's fine.

15:32.248 --> 15:34.310
Which reminds me of a nice thing.

15:34.350 --> 15:34.410
Hi.

15:34.510 --> 15:35.011
Welcome back.

15:36.713 --> 15:46.123
I was reading just the other day a piece about Hirschfeld, you know, the fellow who does the theatrical drawings in the New York Times, who's in his 90s, now I'm still going strong.

15:46.824 --> 15:50.468
Apparently, Jules Pfeiffer said about Hirschfeld that

15:51.005 --> 15:54.830
Hirschfeld is to drawing what Fred Astaire is to dance.

15:55.450 --> 15:56.592
Defines the whole century.

15:56.612 --> 16:00.917
The person who quoted that said, he's got it right there.

16:00.937 --> 16:02.920
You don't need to say anything more about Hirschfeld.

16:02.940 --> 16:06.884
Anyway, so there's this sort of thing.

16:06.924 --> 16:19.780
I paid, what is it, $26 or something for this, which has the full Funk and Weigel's Encyclopedia, the Merriam-Webster Collegiate, the Merriam-Webster Thesaurus, a Hammond atlas.

16:20.418 --> 16:23.202
a Webster's quote book.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.529
It's something like eight reference titles for $26.

16:27.790 --> 16:29.132
That's amazing.

16:29.152 --> 16:30.253
Yeah, it is amazing.

16:30.414 --> 16:31.716
How can they afford to do it?

16:32.156 --> 16:33.979
I don't know, frankly.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.983
Because they're probably not doing any new work.

16:36.023 --> 16:36.904
Well, of course they are.

16:36.944 --> 16:38.186
They're getting this stuff here.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.470
Somebody has to get this material.

16:40.510 --> 16:42.893
And they're beautiful shots of Hitler and Mussolini.

16:42.933 --> 16:46.459
It's that classic shot of Mussolini in which he's sort of

16:46.962 --> 16:50.727
mugging for a brass crowd with his chest puffed out and so on.

16:50.747 --> 17:00.982
Wouldn't it be great to have, I mean, we've seen all these things growing up, you know, and they're still resonant images because you remember them, but to actually have them available at home where you can punch them up.

17:01.242 --> 17:04.687
Imagine in sports, you know, some of those great, great moments.

17:04.867 --> 17:05.248
They do.

17:05.268 --> 17:07.511
The Bobby Thompson home run and, you know.

17:07.812 --> 17:08.473
The Lou Gehrig thing.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.174
The Lou Gehrig thing.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.438
His last visit to New York Yankee Stadium and so on.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.421
So there are things which these

17:14.890 --> 17:20.939
You know, something like this can do, and the Britannicas are trying to figure out how to make it work for them.

17:21.059 --> 17:29.571
Do you agree with Owen Gingrich, who did a review of the Hubble Space Telescope CD-ROM, that these are the incunables of the form?

17:29.611 --> 17:31.233
You know, he said, they're great.

17:31.273 --> 17:38.444
It's a nice, noble try, he says, but years from now they will be regarded as the incunables of the form.

17:38.464 --> 17:39.785
I think that that's true.

17:39.946 --> 17:42.990
I mean, it's a sweeping statement, but it's an interesting observation.

17:43.257 --> 17:45.219
I absolutely agree.

17:45.239 --> 18:03.957
I think we're at the pre-Model T stage even in lots of ways with respect to the presentation of information and creative works, I guess you could say, very broadly on the Internet.

18:04.357 --> 18:08.041
We're very good, I think, with information even now.

18:08.361 --> 18:11.644
With respect to the presentation of creative works, we're still finding a way.

18:12.164 --> 18:25.184
The traditional sort of media are still pretty—and by media is an unfortunate word, I'm also thinking of classic literature and so on—are still, I think, relatively poorly presented in this mode.

18:25.725 --> 18:34.459
One can envision a time when there may be some sort of slab or something magazine-like, which in fact will allow you

18:35.519 --> 18:55.063
to carry it around, to take it to bed, to take it into the bathtub, or to take it to the beach, or whatever, as well as sit down at a desk with it, and provide a very beautiful presentation of images, moving images, good sound.

18:55.212 --> 19:05.902
allows you perhaps to speak to it and call up from Information Central or whatever you want to call the world's library that might be available through telecommunications at that time.

19:06.502 --> 19:09.465
Is this kind of what you're working with, what you personally are working with?

19:09.485 --> 19:10.286
Well, yeah.

19:10.306 --> 19:15.310
It is in a sense, but this is so far away from present technology that it's more a dream.

19:15.510 --> 19:16.912
It is a dream right now.

19:17.432 --> 19:23.818
But I'm just sort of as a thought exercise going through what might happen twenty years, even twenty years from now.

19:24.170 --> 19:25.692
Maybe less.

19:25.912 --> 19:26.513
Or maybe less.

19:27.394 --> 19:28.996
We made that so sometimes.

19:29.137 --> 19:29.938
Oh, absolutely.

19:30.358 --> 19:34.063
The web has just been an astonishing phenomenon.

19:34.223 --> 19:40.231
And one of the things you periodically read about it is a description of a web generation.

19:40.331 --> 19:42.194
A web generation is something like a year.

19:43.776 --> 19:44.857
Unbelievable.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.763
And then after that next year— And how old is your microchip, you know?

19:49.323 --> 19:52.067
Well, that goes back to the early seventies.

19:52.250 --> 19:52.751
I guess.

19:53.091 --> 19:53.972
You look at the speed.

19:54.012 --> 19:55.554
I mean, I bought a computer for five years.

19:55.574 --> 19:56.555
I wrote my book on it.

19:57.376 --> 19:58.657
It was state-of-the-art.

19:58.757 --> 20:00.759
I learned it's 33 megahertz.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.322
Now I just bought a little Toshiba.

20:03.803 --> 20:08.968
There's 133, and already they're going to come out with faster ones.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.231
You can't even hope to keep up with it.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.532
Yeah, it is amazing.

20:13.353 --> 20:21.582
But at some point, we will probably, and maybe within our lifetimes, have

20:22.692 --> 20:28.780
So tell me a little bit about, you know, your role and all that.

20:28.800 --> 20:37.510
Oh, well, as I started to say way back, I was involved in something called the optical disk pilot program, which the library started in the early 80's.

20:37.530 --> 20:46.962
What was the name of it?

20:49.996 --> 20:53.861
Okay, so there was in the early 80s— Optical disk pilot program.

20:53.881 --> 20:54.542
Yes.

20:54.562 --> 21:07.540
And that was our first stab at putting some of our collections in machine-readable form in a very experimental mode, just to see how long it took, how well they reproduced, how well the technology was suited to conversion of our collections, and so on.

21:08.241 --> 21:17.674
That expanded in 1990 into actually a congressionally financed five-year pilot program called American Memory.

21:18.262 --> 21:24.009
And there we took much larger numbers of items and converted them to electronic form.

21:24.931 --> 21:33.261
And then in 95, at the end of the pilot, we were told that it seemed to be quite successful.

21:33.321 --> 21:45.737
We had 44 test sites all over the country, and we discovered that middle and high school kids liked being able to use, and their teachers liked the kids to use, the raw materials that we were supplying.

21:46.240 --> 21:52.288
in our American Memory collection, like Brady photographs 1118 of them from the Civil War.

21:52.909 --> 21:55.052
There are material, you mean, online?

21:55.272 --> 21:55.893
Have you seen this?

21:55.973 --> 21:56.934
Have you seen our site?

21:56.994 --> 21:58.556
I can show you in a few minutes.

21:58.857 --> 21:58.917
No.

21:58.937 --> 22:01.320
Is there something I can crunch into at home?

22:01.380 --> 22:01.760
That's right.

22:02.141 --> 22:03.322
Why don't I do that?

22:03.703 --> 22:05.205
If it's in here, I'll be able to do it.

22:05.746 --> 22:06.146
Okay.

22:06.447 --> 22:10.692
I probably should give you a better version of that, too.

22:11.934 --> 22:14.357
So, long and short of the time for the interview, and

22:14.978 --> 22:15.999
Okay, good.

22:16.040 --> 22:20.426
This is more—I'll grab this opportunity while I have it right here.

22:22.409 --> 22:28.657
So now we have an ambition to have created what we call five million digital items.

22:28.738 --> 22:33.504
That may be between one and two million collection-type items.

22:34.706 --> 22:35.567
From your own collection, of course.

22:35.587 --> 22:38.592
From our own collection, that's right, and put them on the web.

22:38.652 --> 22:43.078
Now, in addition, however, we got a two million—well,

22:43.852 --> 22:48.238
Part of that's being supported by congressional appropriations, about $3 million worth a year.

22:48.619 --> 22:55.748
But in addition, we have to try to match that three to one from private gifts.

22:55.768 --> 23:03.519
And so over the five years, we'd be receiving $15 million from Congress, assuming that all goes well, and we would have to raise $45 million.

23:04.160 --> 23:09.067
And we're halfway there to the $45 million in private gifts at this point.

23:09.708 --> 23:10.329
Like so much?

23:10.469 --> 23:11.050
What kinds of?

23:11.410 --> 23:12.812
Oh, all sorts.

23:13.113 --> 23:25.794
The two biggest gifts were from John Kluge, who was head of the library's friends group called the Madisonians, K-L-U-G-E, until Bill Gates sort of arrived on the scene and Microsoft flourished.

23:26.075 --> 23:28.759
Kluge was the richest man in America, unfortunately.

23:29.521 --> 23:30.662
He's in media.

23:30.703 --> 23:32.325
He has some cable companies.

23:32.465 --> 23:38.175
He doesn't, you know, promote himself and his name very much.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.503
I would say in his seventies now, and he chairs that Madisonian group.

23:42.523 --> 23:46.931
He's still the second or third richest person in the country, has a place over here.

23:47.052 --> 23:47.753
Slipped, right.

23:47.773 --> 23:50.338
Down to probably fifteen billion instead of .

23:50.358 --> 23:52.162
Right, right.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.464
And so he gave us five million.

23:54.794 --> 24:04.084
Kellogg Foundation gave us three million, and that was specifically to help make our collections most usable, as usable as they could be in schools.

24:04.684 --> 24:08.649
And that group recently put out this brochure telling about some of the things they were doing.

24:09.069 --> 24:12.393
Can I have anything that you wanted that you can give me?

24:12.493 --> 24:22.303
I don't have right here, right now, the good brochure on

24:23.633 --> 24:27.138
on our collections that are up, but I'll try to get that one for you.

24:27.298 --> 24:29.341
I'd love to get one before I leave today.

24:29.361 --> 24:30.522
Do you think that'll be possible?

24:30.542 --> 24:30.743
Sure.

24:31.283 --> 24:31.924
Let me see.

24:40.716 --> 24:43.080
I hope at some point I can call you to follow up on this.

24:43.120 --> 24:43.280
Sure.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.204
If you could just tell me, give me a parapet, it would be better.

24:46.725 --> 24:49.689
Great, thank you.

24:51.331 --> 24:52.813
Excellent.

24:53.620 --> 25:04.642
Our goal, then, is to have these millions of items available on the web and freely available by the year 2000.

25:05.905 --> 25:13.300
And they include—well, right now we have 99 so-called actuality motion pictures from the

25:14.191 --> 25:19.479
very earliest period of motion pictures there in three blocks, New York at the turn of this entry.

25:19.499 --> 25:20.080
Actuality.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.321
That's a new phrase.

25:21.341 --> 25:21.742
Yeah.

25:21.762 --> 25:30.595
Well, it's where they set up a camera on a tripod on a street corner or whatever and just captured the actual life that was flowing in front of the camera.

25:31.136 --> 25:40.409
And so there's a wonderful, wonderful shot of the original Ellis Island things, of the boat coming in.

25:40.549 --> 25:43.253
Isn't it great that they had the perception to do that?

25:43.537 --> 25:43.958
It is.

25:44.398 --> 25:47.003
And there are other street scenes.

25:47.103 --> 25:52.432
There is the demolition of a theater, which was done by hand, and it was in fast motion.

25:53.394 --> 26:03.672
And then there's the San Francisco earthquake, you know, and this actually before, during, and after the earthquake.

26:04.681 --> 26:13.835
highly interesting scenes of the devastation that the earthquake caused, and the buildings still on fire, and walls falling down, and soup kitchens, and all the rest of it.

26:14.796 --> 26:20.365
And then there's the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo, and President Harding.

26:21.647 --> 26:29.018
Harding, as you probably know, was assassinated at the exposition in the Music Pavilion.

26:30.179 --> 26:37.387
We have shot the films of him opening the show, also of Harding's, not Harding, McKinley, McKinley's inauguration.

26:37.407 --> 26:39.029
I thought Harding was the people I told him.

26:39.049 --> 26:39.850
Yes, I'm sorry.

26:40.250 --> 26:40.751
I misspoke.

26:41.772 --> 26:56.068
As it happens, we have in our batch of sound recordings something called the Nation's Forum, which documents the sort of public, famous public speeches at the time of the conclusion of World War I, but also the 1920 election.

26:56.470 --> 27:01.216
So there's a very early 1920 recording of Franklin Roosevelt talking on Americanism.

27:01.296 --> 27:07.144
He was running for vice president with Cox against Harding and Coolidge.

27:07.985 --> 27:10.609
Harding is here unimagined.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.610
Yeah, yeah.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.134
And they're up and online, and those things are all downloadable.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.395
That stuff would never be available.

27:15.876 --> 27:16.897
No.

27:17.458 --> 27:25.549
You would normally have to be a scholar working on a specific project with some funds, with some backing, to come here and see that stuff.

27:25.883 --> 27:34.741
I mean, my feeling, if you know anything about my book, I wrote about print culture and books and the passion for books, but I feel also you have to have an open mind.

27:34.841 --> 27:38.087
You have to look at this stuff with an open mind.

27:38.127 --> 27:42.236
I agree completely, of course.

27:42.276 --> 27:45.462
I love books, and I love all the other materials the library has here.

27:45.880 --> 27:56.720
But I think it is a stupendous development and a miracle that we are able now to take these things and make them available to people in their homes and offices and schools all over the country.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.683
And affirmatively make them available.

27:58.904 --> 28:01.709
I mean, to actually set up sites.

28:01.729 --> 28:07.399
They're not just available, say, that you can just casually find them, but you're actually going out of your way

28:08.037 --> 28:11.261
to say, look, this is the memory of America.

28:12.082 --> 28:14.025
Go look at it and learn from it.

28:14.325 --> 28:18.210
And we'll even help you with facilities to get online.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.174
That's a noble thing, as I view.

28:21.194 --> 28:21.314
Right.

28:21.334 --> 28:33.910
And you'll learn about our education efforts, that in fact we are trying to help teachers to find ways of coping with these new ways of presenting material to kids.

28:34.160 --> 28:43.332
When you pull the kids away from textbooks and teachers away from textbooks and traditional curricula, why then they probably need some help, and we're trying to provide some of that.

28:43.392 --> 28:51.243
Do you find that as you move ahead with this that you have to be almost a public relations man?

28:51.263 --> 29:02.057
I mean, that you don't really—that you have to be really alert to the feelings of this other community, of people who perhaps feel that

29:02.476 --> 29:04.479
You know, you're attempting to put them out of business.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.301
Well, yes.

29:08.144 --> 29:29.133
That was very evident to us a year and a half ago when, with the new, what is it, almost two years ago now, with the new Republican Congress, one of the things that Newt Gingrich, who was a great champion, as you may know, of books, but also of electronic media, just like Al Gore.

29:29.714 --> 29:31.757
The two of them were here at a conference one.

29:31.906 --> 30:01.305
And in any event, when the Republicans then took control of Congress, he told the library in mid-December that he wanted the library to provide congressional documents in a service from the Library of Congress and for the Congress to the American people, so that folks would not, well,

30:01.842 --> 30:15.359
to sort of try to create a level playing field, as they say, for both the lobbyists and the associations in Washington and the American people generally across the country.

30:15.379 --> 30:21.907
So that the Congressional record and other essential texts of all the bills and so on would be readily available.

30:22.107 --> 30:31.579
So in two weeks we put up the first incarnation of what we now call Thomas, which does include all of those things.

30:33.145 --> 30:46.624
So we have had good congressional support, and we are opening up treasure troves of information, and the government is generally, and many other institutions are, in ways that we're undreamed of.

30:46.725 --> 30:48.567
National Archives, are you doing that as well?

30:48.627 --> 30:49.949
Archives is beginning to do it.

30:50.270 --> 30:52.633
The government printing office is making many things available.

30:52.773 --> 30:56.699
Federal register is now available, and so on.

30:56.999 --> 31:01.566
I started to tell you a little bit about Britannica.

31:01.900 --> 31:07.826
I had occasion to try to get information about, what is it called, Sanctare.

31:08.327 --> 31:14.753
I'd never heard of it before, and I was reading something about Italy, and the variable was referred to as Sanctare.

31:15.214 --> 31:16.455
How do you feel about it?

31:16.475 --> 31:25.064
I think it's something like Cia, whatever five is in Italy, Italian, Sanctare, and then terre, and probably places or villages or something.

31:26.045 --> 31:29.629
And I, as it happens, because of

31:29.930 --> 31:35.517
relationship we were trying to establish with the Britannica at the time, I had access to the Britannica online.

31:35.737 --> 31:39.462
It's also available on the web, as a pay service, as well as on CD-ROM.

31:40.524 --> 31:51.838
And so I got into the Britannica and looked it up, did a full-text search, and I either found nothing or found only a couple tiny references which weren't helpful.

31:52.379 --> 31:59.768
And then I just got out and into the web generally and went to one of the big search engines and looked it up.

32:00.170 --> 32:05.357
I don't know who or why, had put up a full site devoted to the Sanctuary.

32:06.419 --> 32:11.446
And there were pictures of the villages and, you know, information for tourists.

32:11.486 --> 32:14.510
If you wanted to go there, here's where you could stay and here's what you will see.

32:14.571 --> 32:18.356
And, you know, the history of how they happened to exist.

32:18.897 --> 32:19.197
Could be.

32:19.878 --> 32:21.500
Yeah, but it was a fairly decent history.

32:22.181 --> 32:25.446
It didn't, you know, it didn't have the authority of the Britannica.

32:25.506 --> 32:28.911
I don't know if it was just a tourist office or something telling me stuff.

32:29.397 --> 32:30.859
It sounded reasonably authentic.

32:30.879 --> 32:31.721
But there was information.

32:31.861 --> 32:37.430
And there were certainly pictures, which presumably were not faked, and there was this abundance of information.

32:37.450 --> 32:50.871
There was also, I was also interested recently, I came across, you remember the seamen, the sailors on the bounty, when they were, some of them escaped and settled in an island.

32:51.292 --> 32:51.873
Pitcairn Island.

32:51.893 --> 32:52.614
Pitcairn, that's it.

32:52.934 --> 32:56.620
I was interested in Pitcairn, and I looked it up in several of the

32:57.663 --> 33:00.167
in effect, published tools were encyclopedias I had.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.168
And there was a little information.

33:01.229 --> 33:09.001
But there's apparently a Pitcairn fanatic who has a website and who has just provided this cornucopia of information on Pitcairn.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.944
So you probably just punch up Pitcairn.

33:10.984 --> 33:11.465
Exactly.

33:11.485 --> 33:11.585
Yeah.

33:12.967 --> 33:16.452
And so it is a sort of living encyclopedia, patchy.

33:16.532 --> 33:24.565
You don't know the full story of the authority of the information or the validity of the information that you're reading.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.202
But generally, it seems to be pretty good.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.163
Almost like oral history stuff, basically.

33:28.664 --> 33:29.124
Exactly.

33:29.505 --> 33:34.471
I mean, you know, you listen to an oral history, you have to document everything somebody says.

33:34.551 --> 33:36.133
It's making us all scholars, in a sense.

33:36.153 --> 33:36.573
That's right, really.

33:36.593 --> 33:38.595
Those people who are using this seriously as an information source.

33:38.615 --> 33:41.559
You have to approach it with this understanding that this is raw material.

33:42.580 --> 33:50.069
And, you know, if you want to take it any further for any scholarly reason, it behooves you to document it independently.

33:50.089 --> 33:54.754
Yeah, and there's where institutions like ours, and for that matter the Botanica, have

33:54.937 --> 33:57.000
seems to me a significant role.

33:58.042 --> 34:06.675
In our case, of course, we're presenting some of the raw materials from our collections, but generally we try to provide a framework.

34:07.756 --> 34:17.711
And in the case of many of our things, the stuff itself, the, in effect, digital artifact, is authentic.

34:17.731 --> 34:18.753
I mean, it has to be authentic.

34:18.893 --> 34:21.737
For instance, in the case of the photographs of the Civil War,

34:23.371 --> 34:30.057
As it happens, we do have a little piece attached to that collection, asking the question, can photographs lie?

34:31.038 --> 34:45.390
And that, when we created what we called Exhibit, tells how some of the Brady photographers actually manipulated the sight, moved the body, and so on, to make a certain effect.

34:45.811 --> 34:47.832
And we sort of warn people that that's the case.

34:47.892 --> 34:53.057
But regardless, there are all of these photographs which are

34:54.202 --> 35:10.202
The authentic artifacts from that period, whether they're showing you a scene which is actual, or whether they're in fact showing you something about the way photographers manipulated a scene, that's also a fact about the Civil War and what was happening.

35:10.222 --> 35:12.926
They still, there were photographers who do that today.

35:15.489 --> 35:18.032
Probably.

35:18.468 --> 35:24.742
I mean, the first one wasn't quite as dramatic.

35:25.183 --> 35:25.644
That's famous.

35:25.864 --> 35:30.354
They asked them to do it again, and the one they did again is the one that's that monument out there.

35:31.096 --> 35:34.764
Tell me, do you have a plan, a grand plan?

35:34.844 --> 35:38.552
I mean, you did mention the year 2000.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.667
We do have a plan, and the plan is for a transition.

35:41.687 --> 35:56.871
We hope that with this special program we can initiate things, get the institution moving in a certain direction, but we expect that what we're doing now should become the routine business of the Library of Congress by the year 2000.

35:56.891 --> 36:06.767
And part of our project plan is in fact to integrate this into normal library procedures and processes and so on.

36:07.591 --> 36:29.380
Well, you know, I think I'm going to talk to you again and see how we're doing and where we are.

36:29.647 --> 36:38.077
Well, John probably told you we have lots of things in mind for the year 2000, because it will be our 200th anniversary, as well as, of course, a millennium year.

36:39.198 --> 36:55.938
And the librarian is keen to make the so-called National Digital Library a sort of centerpiece of that celebration, representing the fact that we now have this new and perhaps more effective way of serving the entire nation.

36:56.599 --> 36:59.502
What we've hoarded here for 200 years is now

36:59.836 --> 37:03.541
Do you work at all with the Corvus people?

37:04.882 --> 37:06.965
I was out there for a couple of days last month.

37:08.948 --> 37:09.729
Yes and no.

37:10.149 --> 37:12.612
Our Princeton Photographs Division worked some with them.

37:15.336 --> 37:18.580
Have you seen this article in the latest Wired magazine?

37:19.381 --> 37:20.222
Is this a copy?

37:20.782 --> 37:27.531
It's my own copy, but we could make a copy for you, or you could pick up the thing.

37:28.017 --> 37:31.020
It's in their usual typography, which drives me crazy.

37:31.441 --> 37:32.662
This is Wired Magazine?

37:32.682 --> 37:32.962
Yeah.

37:32.982 --> 37:36.886
In his image, Bill Gates Corbis is more than the ultimate digital stocking house.

37:36.906 --> 37:37.427
Oh, I have to get that.

37:37.447 --> 37:39.830
It may be the first online for-profit library.

37:40.350 --> 37:41.091
See, I have to get this.

37:41.431 --> 37:42.893
This is Wired Magazine.

37:42.913 --> 37:44.535
Yeah, the latest issue.

37:45.155 --> 37:46.096
You can buy that anywhere?

37:46.957 --> 37:49.260
Well, most big newsstands, at least.

37:49.320 --> 37:55.206
For instance, down here at the Trover Shop between 2nd and 3rd on Pennsylvania is where we got this copy.

37:55.827 --> 38:00.215
It's the current issue, which presumably is November.

38:02.099 --> 38:03.361
I was just out there.

38:04.283 --> 38:07.068
I spent two days with Otto Bettman in Florida.

38:07.088 --> 38:07.890
I interviewed Otto.

38:07.910 --> 38:08.812
Bettman is still alive, isn't he?

38:08.912 --> 38:09.974
Alive and lucid.

38:10.775 --> 38:11.136
Wonderful.

38:11.156 --> 38:11.657
What is he?

38:11.938 --> 38:12.879
In 93.

38:13.220 --> 38:13.681
He's 93?

38:13.701 --> 38:16.907
Yeah, 93.

38:17.343 --> 38:24.109
Well, Corbus was here a couple years ago and tried to negotiate with our Princeton Photographs Division.

38:24.169 --> 38:33.838
It's mentioned in the article that the library has 15 million mainly photographs, about 12 or 13 million photographs of the 15 million items in our Princeton Photographs Division.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.680
And they're public domain items, we must stress.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.662
Well, only some of them, actually.

38:37.762 --> 38:38.522
They're both.

38:39.023 --> 38:46.810
Bettman actually got a number of things from that collection himself, just had copies made of public domain things.

38:47.110 --> 39:01.492
was interested in an arrangement which never fully satisfied us, because it would have made the digital versions of these photographs too proprietary for our purposes.

39:02.153 --> 39:09.625
We view ourselves as in the business of trying to make as much available freely to the whole world as possible.

39:09.875 --> 39:15.262
And there were certain constraints on the contract they wanted to do with us, which caused us some problems.

39:15.282 --> 39:20.629
So in the end, they did, in effect, what Bettman and many others have done, which is simply to make copies of things.

39:20.729 --> 39:24.013
And then what they do with those copies is their business.

39:24.233 --> 39:26.737
Yeah, he provides immediate access.

39:27.097 --> 39:27.938
Yeah, the value added.

39:27.958 --> 39:29.340
People are willing to pay for it.

39:29.360 --> 39:29.921
Exactly.

39:30.582 --> 39:34.887
On the other hand, Corbis right now is a member of

39:35.710 --> 39:39.498
a group of supporters of our geography and map division.

39:39.558 --> 39:48.939
They have, I can't remember what they're calling it, but it's a group of people in the business of creating digitized geographic and cartographic information.

39:49.821 --> 39:55.373
And they support our geography and map division, which is a vast collection of

39:55.623 --> 39:57.526
I was there yesterday.

39:57.626 --> 39:59.388
I hope you got a chance to see some of this.

39:59.529 --> 40:00.870
A city block in one.

40:00.891 --> 40:01.211
Right.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.913
They show you some of their treasures also.

40:02.933 --> 40:03.594
Yeah, we went through them.

40:03.614 --> 40:03.895
It's amazing.

40:04.936 --> 40:05.998
And I love maps.

40:06.018 --> 40:06.539
Oh, I do too.

40:06.559 --> 40:07.760
It was a great treat.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.705
Yeah, yeah.

40:10.885 --> 40:21.580
And so, you know, there's all this historical, geographic, and social, every economic, every other kind of information embodied in maps, in cartographic form.

40:21.982 --> 40:36.779
So many of the people who are associated with creating digital maps are partly from self-interest, but probably partly for other reasons too, interested in that body of stuff being digitized as rapidly and as well as possible.

40:37.700 --> 40:44.648
And so geography and map people have been able to sort of harness that interest and to

40:45.286 --> 40:46.448
gifts of various sorts.

40:46.708 --> 40:52.737
Hewlett Packard has given them several hundred thousand dollars worth of scanning and other equipment, and other people have been quite generous.

40:53.258 --> 40:59.067
But Corbus is one of the members of that group that gave a gift to the library.

40:59.948 --> 41:05.757
And the librarian is interested in other possible modes of relationship, too.

41:06.999 --> 41:09.302
So yes, they're a very active player on the scene.

41:09.468 --> 41:13.615
This tells that they, in fact, have a very long vision, unfortunately.

41:13.715 --> 41:17.140
I interviewed this fellow, Doug Rowan, who's the head of the service.

41:17.161 --> 41:17.882
The president, yeah.

41:17.902 --> 41:20.025
And he mentioned that they have a plan.

41:20.125 --> 41:27.978
I'll be interested to see if they get to see the plan, because I said, you know, they have, what, 17 million images now.

41:28.198 --> 41:35.290
I mean, with the Bettman acquisition, which was all of UPI, it was 16 million images.

41:35.557 --> 41:36.900
So they've got seventeen and a half.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.362
You know, they've got a pretty good base.

41:38.523 --> 41:40.406
Absolutely, they do.

41:40.426 --> 41:41.829
And I said, well, do you have an idea?

41:41.869 --> 41:43.212
I mean, do you have a scheme?

41:43.232 --> 41:45.176
Do you have an outline of things that you need?

41:45.636 --> 41:46.518
Oh, absolutely.

41:46.578 --> 41:48.362
I said, gee, can I see it?

41:48.382 --> 41:50.426
Oh, I don't think so, he said.

41:50.506 --> 41:51.768
So they didn't let me see it.

41:52.329 --> 41:54.313
I'd be curious to know if they got access to it.

41:55.355 --> 41:57.379
They talked a lot about the future, but I don't.

41:57.832 --> 41:59.234
I don't recall anything.

41:59.274 --> 42:00.516
No, he wouldn't tell me.

42:00.576 --> 42:02.339
About their specific plans.

42:02.439 --> 42:04.321
And I wasn't writing for a right now, either.

42:04.382 --> 42:06.685
I was planning to write down the road, you know.

42:06.925 --> 42:07.947
Yeah.

42:07.967 --> 42:26.674
The person who wrote this article, what is his name, Rapaport, had a very, this isn't something you need, um, enthusiastic, provided a very enthusiastic account of his, um,

42:27.802 --> 42:29.865
preview of the Leonardo.

42:29.905 --> 42:30.886
I had the same preview.

42:30.906 --> 42:31.327
Oh, you did?

42:31.587 --> 42:33.970
Well, he was apparently blown away by it.

42:33.990 --> 42:34.691
Yeah, I was.

42:34.811 --> 42:39.277
I just wrote a piece on Otto for this Biblio magazine that I'm writing for.

42:40.639 --> 42:45.566
And I started with, you know, I attended the auction when Gates bought that.

42:45.906 --> 42:46.387
Oh, did you?

42:46.407 --> 42:47.288
For $30 million.

42:47.348 --> 42:48.670
In fact, I have it in my book.

42:49.871 --> 42:52.935
And it's interesting now that he's using it.

42:54.317 --> 42:57.201
I mean, it seems to me that $30 million, you can write that off now.

42:57.502 --> 43:00.508
It's not just a collectible item.

43:00.528 --> 43:05.176
I mean, Corbis is—but did they explain the codoscope there?

43:05.397 --> 43:06.058
Yes, they did.

43:06.579 --> 43:13.111
And in fact, he mentions that when they showed this feature to Gates—let's see.

43:15.917 --> 43:20.165
And he said, you know, how thrilled he was to have that capability.

43:20.445 --> 43:20.826
Oh, here.

43:20.992 --> 43:29.259
When Gates first viewed the transformation rendered by the Codoscope, he told Rowan that Corbis had, quote, raised the bar on all multimedia presentations, unquote.

43:29.780 --> 43:35.905
Such a stunningly prosaic take on this wondrous addition to the understanding of one of the world's greatest artists makes me suspect.

43:37.046 --> 43:40.129
Is Corbis just Bill Gates' electronic butterfly net, et cetera?

43:40.149 --> 43:40.849
I'll let you read it.

43:41.230 --> 43:47.675
Well, you know, what Doug told me, Corbis is wholly owned by Gates.

43:47.915 --> 43:49.817
It's not a subsidiary of Microsoft.

43:50.658 --> 43:52.600
I mean, so they are not required.

43:52.620 --> 43:55.303
They don't have to tell you what their budget is.

43:55.404 --> 43:56.505
It's totally private.

43:57.586 --> 43:58.307
And they have 350 employees.

43:58.327 --> 44:02.632
I mean, you basically have a 350 employee plaything.

44:03.793 --> 44:04.214
It is.

44:04.294 --> 44:06.697
He's testing the waters.

44:06.877 --> 44:08.038
He's brilliant.

44:08.098 --> 44:10.441
He has an idea of what he's doing.

44:10.621 --> 44:10.982
No doubt.

44:11.482 --> 44:16.989
But this also fits in with what seems to be a sort of larger strategy of Microsoft itself.

44:17.469 --> 44:20.513
As you know, they're redoing the Microsoft network.

44:20.797 --> 44:24.761
this next month to make it much heavier in content.

44:25.201 --> 44:41.098
Interestingly to me, they are using more of a television metaphor, as America Online has done recently, in their presentation of Microsoft Network, so that there are channels rather than, say, chapters or whatever, which is an interesting phenomenon in itself.

44:41.778 --> 44:47.344
And they seem also to be getting much more heavily into entertainment in the Microsoft Network

44:47.830 --> 44:52.797
So there will be things more comparable to what you might find on television.

44:52.817 --> 45:02.389
But there's still, interestingly to me, is sort of the information component, which we'll have there in Carta, Encyclopedia, and an online version and other things.

45:02.430 --> 45:04.272
So it's a curious hybrid.

45:04.953 --> 45:12.823
But he's clearly sort of finding, feeling his way towards creating content of all sorts from the far end of the entertainment spectrum.

45:12.843 --> 45:16.268
More than feeling his way, I think it's considered

45:16.636 --> 45:19.739
And as Rowan explained, he said, you know, it's just a natural progression.

45:19.759 --> 45:25.665
I mean, he foresaw this whole operating system that nobody, the big companies couldn't be bothered with.

45:25.865 --> 45:26.906
We'll build the computers.

45:27.147 --> 45:29.409
Who cares about the software to run it?

45:30.089 --> 45:30.430
He did.

45:31.110 --> 45:33.213
And now the next step seems content.

45:34.154 --> 45:36.095
And he also has figured out the whole network thing.

45:36.136 --> 45:37.797
And he's figured out the whole network thing.

45:37.877 --> 45:38.598
It's competition with Netscape.

45:38.618 --> 45:46.626
And I think Netscape essentially is on the verge of throwing in the towel on its browser and then moving into the intranet thing.

45:46.775 --> 45:48.297
Microsoft is interested in that, too.

45:48.317 --> 45:50.902
Because I use Netscape, and I like Netscape.

45:50.922 --> 45:51.743
We'll see what happens.

45:51.763 --> 45:52.584
Well, I use both, actually.

45:52.604 --> 45:57.392
They both have nice, slightly different features, in any event.

45:59.275 --> 46:00.217
We're running out of time.

46:00.277 --> 46:03.121
Yeah, I'm going to have to start preparing for some other things.

46:04.063 --> 46:06.066
I appreciate the—I'll get an hour.
