WEBVTT

00:04.148 --> 00:23.203
I think, you know, it's probably human nature, but it seems that people remember the suffering of other people most vividly, if anything, you know, so that I had no trouble finding people who would tell me, you know, what my mother went through.

00:25.225 --> 00:31.960
Oh, no, no.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.262
Like, I described something.

00:33.282 --> 00:35.527
You know, she was capable of anger.

00:35.567 --> 00:40.739
You know, remember the scene where she beats up the mule, where she threw rocks on the mule and so forth.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.529
And she was very emotional and...

00:45.830 --> 00:48.754
It was a human being, yeah.

00:49.134 --> 00:52.579
Oh yeah, and I remember her humor, you know.

00:52.599 --> 01:02.232
I remember, you know, I didn't put this in the book, but the first time I had, you know, I couldn't sleep in the afternoon.

01:02.272 --> 01:03.514
Greek people sleep in the afternoon.

01:03.554 --> 01:06.538
I would go wandering around.

01:06.957 --> 01:20.596
there was a young man in our neighborhood who just got married, and of course, everybody lived in the same house, so he had gone to a hay shed, you know, with his wife in the afternoon to make love to her.

01:20.736 --> 01:26.023
And I was wandering along because I couldn't sleep, and I hear these grunting noises.

01:26.103 --> 01:28.426
It must have been about six or six, I think.

01:28.587 --> 01:33.994
And I looked through the window, and I saw these two legs up in the air, you know, and him puffing and puffing, you know.

01:33.974 --> 01:37.993
And then he, you know, he sort of pulled off her, you know.

01:38.475 --> 01:42.634
And the window was in such a way that I saw her

01:42.985 --> 01:46.712
private parts, you know.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.355
I'm just telling you the idea.

01:48.375 --> 01:55.869
And so I went back and I described it all to my mother and I said, you know, I saw this thing, you know, it was like a fish that opened and closed, you know.

01:56.410 --> 02:02.941
And she called all the neighbors, you know, and had me tell to hear it and everything.

02:02.961 --> 02:05.466
So, I mean, she, it was...

02:05.446 --> 02:07.148
She doesn't have humor, you know.

02:07.188 --> 02:11.792
She was very, she was a human being.

02:12.353 --> 02:16.617
But I'm wondering if you remember her about her.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.779
Oh yeah, absolutely.

02:18.799 --> 02:19.079
Absolutely.

02:19.119 --> 02:33.073
What I do remember about her that makes her unusual, rare, is that

02:34.083 --> 02:45.775
when she, you know, she was not somebody who looked for troubles, you know, and basically she avoided it and sort of, you know, tried to bend, you know.

02:45.795 --> 02:53.283
One of the things that she used to have is, you know, the tree that bends to solid sleeves, you know, on its branches.

02:53.463 --> 02:58.588
But we, well, when she made up her mind, it's something

02:59.328 --> 03:02.712
She was nothing to swear.

03:02.913 --> 03:18.874
And when she decided to go, and my sister said, I won't go, she said, you know, I will go tell them what you were planning, and they'll kill me in front of you, and she would have done it, you know.

03:18.894 --> 03:21.057
She was... She was... There was not a bluff.

03:21.097 --> 03:24.682
My sister knew her, but they knew her, and they knew her.

03:24.702 --> 03:26.584
Because she could not bear to lose...

03:27.188 --> 03:48.272
And, which is, it's an awful phrase in English, but in, in Greek, you know, but I can, you know, it's something that people... And then there was one witness who was taught to use it, yes.

03:48.292 --> 03:55.761
Yeah, there were, there were, well, there was a fellow taxi who was there.

03:56.163 --> 04:01.910
And there was this woman who went back.

04:01.930 --> 04:02.972
She didn't quite see it.

04:03.032 --> 04:08.358
She just heard it and started running back.

04:08.378 --> 04:14.346
But it was this little gnome of a man who told me about it.

04:14.546 --> 04:23.858
And you said you couldn't get any fear earlier and had it back to you.

04:24.783 --> 04:27.326
I think you said that's why you wanted to go into that.

04:27.346 --> 04:27.446
Yeah.

04:28.067 --> 04:31.791
And I could have, it was a little weird.

04:31.811 --> 04:42.503
But, you know, the needs of the right area, I said to myself, I need this guy, you know, I need more information from this guy.

04:42.523 --> 04:53.016
You know, he had been, you know, he had been captive by the, and he had spent 17 years, 18 years in jail, so he went, it was paid.

04:53.036 --> 04:54.317
Is there anyone,

04:54.685 --> 05:17.571
Well, I think

05:19.087 --> 05:32.438
No, no, I know it, you know, it's really, and it's the thing that I think that has given me tremendous advantage in life and has made my life a lot better than most people's lives.

05:33.380 --> 05:42.354
It's the love of family and children and people.

05:42.574 --> 05:47.982
Happiness comes from human relationships, not from anything else.

05:48.002 --> 05:49.785
And that's the only thing we're done for.

05:50.238 --> 05:51.741
People you love.

05:51.761 --> 05:58.974
And I don't know if I'm capable of dying for somebody else, but she couldn't be right.

05:59.235 --> 06:06.348
And I do know that, I mean, that's why I live here, close to my family, close to my sister.

06:06.368 --> 06:10.896
I mean, I can live anywhere and I can survive anywhere and I have, you know.

06:10.876 --> 06:20.774
But this is where my roots are, where I get my nourishment, my emotions.

06:21.756 --> 06:25.303
For me, it's not just me, it's my whole family.

06:25.323 --> 06:29.370
My sisters, my brothers and all, my nephews, my everybody.

06:29.570 --> 06:30.652
About a hundred people.

06:30.893 --> 06:33.137
Yeah, pretty much.

06:34.265 --> 06:39.090
And this is what I prize the most in my life, you know.

06:39.110 --> 06:47.397
And this gives me tremendous strength because I know if I lose everything else, I mean, having that is enough.

06:47.898 --> 06:58.548
You mentioned early on in the book that you actually engineered, or you suggest that you engineered outside of Athens to do this particular story?

06:59.229 --> 07:01.791
I think so, you know.

07:02.024 --> 07:03.246
You know, I did a lot of things.

07:03.266 --> 07:06.511
I think I became a investigative reporter for the same reason.

07:06.531 --> 07:12.380
I think everything I did was really training for this.

07:12.400 --> 07:17.888
And, you know, I didn't realize it until I started doing it.

07:18.008 --> 07:22.275
To find out at the beginning of both?

07:22.956 --> 07:25.720
Well, I mean, the most visible...

07:25.953 --> 07:35.365
The emotion on the service was to get even, basically, but the... Yeah, to avenge myself.

07:36.407 --> 07:37.288
Yeah, to get even.

07:37.328 --> 07:42.855
But deeper down, I think, and more real, was to find out.

07:44.718 --> 07:52.688
My mother has always, you know, has always treated me as a human being.

07:52.808 --> 07:54.070
I mean, I don't know...

07:55.180 --> 08:00.027
Any other person, I have, you know, personally, I've read about them

08:00.209 --> 08:05.356
made a conscious decision to die for coming home.

08:05.376 --> 08:09.361
This book, obviously, is about your mother, obviously.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.864
But there's a wider case study.

08:11.884 --> 08:16.250
I read there's a case study and a wider... Did you intend that?

08:16.270 --> 08:21.077
You definitely tell me everything I need to know about them.

08:21.097 --> 08:23.680
Well, it's three things, really.

08:24.101 --> 08:25.963
First of all, it's about my mother.

08:26.416 --> 08:39.258
And second, it's a love story, you know, it's a love story of a basic, the most basic kind is the love of a pagan child, you know, etc.

08:39.398 --> 08:52.120
But also, it's about a world that no longer exists, and the world of the Greeks, of a rural peasant village.

08:52.268 --> 09:06.102
And where basically, which is a microcosm of the world as a whole, you know, with all its hatreds and abilities and humanity and so forth.

09:06.803 --> 09:10.907
So it was a way of me, you know, I wanted to find out everything about this world.

09:11.327 --> 09:17.553
I mean, I found out more, you know, what I had is only about one sentence in the book.

09:18.214 --> 09:22.258
And beyond that, it's also really a...

09:23.352 --> 09:38.169
I studied the corruption of revolutions and of high hopes and of the futility of putting any cause above human life.

09:38.209 --> 09:49.022
The futility and the futility.

09:50.723 --> 10:07.578
Actually, the only thing worth, you know, the thing is my mother really likes what her life means, what her death means, basically, is that the only thing worth sacrificing me for is for someone you love.

10:07.698 --> 10:08.159
Nothing else.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.061
No cause.

10:09.081 --> 10:10.504
I've been leaving.

10:10.855 --> 10:18.849
I mean, I had deep convictions and I would fight in a war to defend freedom and all justice and all that stuff like that.

10:18.869 --> 10:35.158
But, you know, if somebody said to me, you know, you know, step in front of a firing squad for any cause, I would not do it.

10:36.235 --> 10:45.974
I imagine that this is just about... Yeah.

10:48.659 --> 10:53.228
But it was safe.

10:53.489 --> 10:58.378
I mean, this year was...

10:58.358 --> 11:01.822
But it was the same.

11:02.562 --> 11:09.290
Again, it was this iron world dedication, I guess.

11:09.350 --> 11:18.239
Well, it's really about women as well.

11:19.080 --> 11:27.589
In most of the world, women struggle with

11:28.396 --> 11:40.817
basic questions of survival, of keeping their children alive, let alone whether they should send them to a daycare centre, whether they can keep them alive.

11:41.738 --> 11:52.716
And this is true, one of the most in two-thirds of the world, unfortunately.

11:54.159 --> 11:54.960
And the burden of

11:56.780 --> 12:01.847
of life is more heavily laid on women, you know, in my view, than on men.

12:03.370 --> 12:08.217
I'm talking about in generalities now, in general terms.

12:09.278 --> 12:22.197
And the strongest people I've ever met have, and the people I've admired most, have been women, and the most influential people in my life have been women, you know, my mother, the school teacher, and my wife.

12:25.214 --> 12:28.217
Yeah.

12:28.517 --> 12:36.846
That's about the razor and the bullet and stuff.

12:37.206 --> 12:43.413
He's a roof, that's him.

12:43.773 --> 12:45.915
Did you tell him?

12:45.935 --> 12:50.580
No, I didn't.

12:50.898 --> 12:54.043
I've talked to some of them.

12:54.063 --> 13:00.894
They say, I'll go do it, you know.

13:00.934 --> 13:02.316
Where is he?

13:02.417 --> 13:17.060
I don't think much... It's funny, but, you know, a lot of people have told me, you know, and I... I question myself about it.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.222
I mean, it's the thing...

13:18.657 --> 13:32.618
In a way, it was facing something that would have said for me, and... I had that sort of a mentality.

13:32.638 --> 13:41.070
You know, my mother put her life on the line for me, and in the end, I couldn't do it for her, you know.

13:41.090 --> 13:42.893
It's not, but, you know...

13:43.447 --> 13:45.858
She was saving people.

13:45.918 --> 13:47.686
You would save nobody.

13:50.177 --> 13:50.779
That's true.

13:50.799 --> 13:51.904
I've never heard of that.

13:52.576 --> 14:02.590
I mean, that doesn't mean you wouldn't feel bad by doing it.

14:02.810 --> 14:05.134
I would have felt a lot better, actually.

14:05.154 --> 14:14.787
But the guy was so old, I wish I'd found him when he was 55, you know, and hostile, and then, you know, it would have been easier.

14:15.644 --> 14:16.665
I would have done anything.

14:17.206 --> 14:29.180
But, you know, basically I didn't want to change the focus of what happened to my mother because it's focused on my act rather than her act.

14:29.260 --> 14:33.145
You know, because her acts are more important to me.

14:33.165 --> 14:38.291
Her sacrifice is more important than my vengeance.

14:38.311 --> 14:38.952
And that's her.

14:38.972 --> 14:39.072
Yeah.

14:39.092 --> 14:40.434
I don't know what else to ask you right now.

14:40.454 --> 14:42.596
I mean, I said that.

14:43.037 --> 14:43.137
Yeah.

14:45.817 --> 14:54.732
Well, you know, there are emotions that exist everywhere.

14:54.832 --> 14:59.279
But it doesn't matter to me.

14:59.299 --> 15:06.812
I think this is what I want my...

15:07.383 --> 15:24.396
Well, you know, I hope that

15:25.051 --> 15:35.000
I will write something meaningful again, but nothing that I will write again that I have written before, it is personally meaningful.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.161
It is personally meaningful.

15:36.181 --> 15:37.362
It can be.

15:37.382 --> 15:38.843
It is work out of there.

15:38.863 --> 15:42.466
What's the first, I asked you this earlier, how do you feel when you finish it?

15:42.486 --> 15:48.812
Do you feel, have you established in your own mind that you're finished with your example?

15:48.832 --> 15:54.957
Well, I feel that

15:55.848 --> 16:02.157
I've fulfilled my mission in life.

16:02.217 --> 16:25.669
I mean, this is a goal I set for myself to write a book about what happened and to write it in a way that would be meaningful to a lot of people so that, you know, what happened there is not only not forgotten, but it's...

16:27.235 --> 16:35.283
It helps just a little bit to improve the species, you know.

16:35.303 --> 16:42.290
How about, are you... I mean, the reason I was in Europe, I know, yeah.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.352
I think that was a very long speech.

16:44.612 --> 16:45.353
Have you won?

16:45.373 --> 16:47.455
You say in the book, I left my job.

16:47.475 --> 16:48.476
Yeah, I did, I left my job.

16:48.496 --> 16:55.403
But, you know, I have such a close relationship with them that there are certain things that are...
