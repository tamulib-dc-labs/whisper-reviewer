WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:03.979
Go ahead.

00:03.999 --> 00:06.042
I'm sorry, you were analyzing something.

00:06.062 --> 00:07.824
Well, it's just, I analyzed it.

00:07.844 --> 00:09.467
I mean, I'm very glad that I did.

00:09.887 --> 00:17.759
I'm glad that it came up that way because I've been trying to think of a better, I'm trying to come to a better view of it.

00:18.760 --> 00:28.294
And what I just said is actually very important to me in that it sort of clicked and made sense now.

00:28.654 --> 00:33.261
That what's, the problem here is the degree to which one must

00:34.068 --> 00:38.555
separate oneself from the external stimuli in order to do what you do.

00:40.077 --> 00:45.866
And especially if you don't like the way it is.

00:46.287 --> 00:57.424
But you cannot ever simply lose yourself in what you do and not take into account what's on the outside.

00:57.444 --> 01:02.472
You mentioned earlier, and I think it is true to me, in light of what you've been saying,

01:03.093 --> 01:08.179
that you lived in about 40 different places in the course of your life?

01:08.419 --> 01:09.821
Immensely destructive.

01:09.921 --> 01:18.371
I mean, there were advantages to some extent, but I sometimes sit and count on my fingers the number of different places.

01:18.532 --> 01:20.394
Can you just throw out a couple?

01:21.675 --> 01:26.461
Not 40, but... Just give me an idea.

01:26.661 --> 01:32.188
I was born in Manhattan, and I lived in...

01:32.860 --> 01:42.352
Manhattan in Westchester County, New York, in Jamaica, in New Hampshire.

01:42.592 --> 01:50.963
Now, this is a pretty Southern County summer camp in New New Hampshire, but I went there for four years.

01:50.983 --> 01:54.067
Where did you go to summer camp in New Hampshire?

01:54.087 --> 01:55.969
I went to a summer camp in New Hampshire.

01:55.989 --> 02:01.416
It was all with Camp Lawrence, up in Lakewood,

02:01.784 --> 02:03.767
Very young, very young.

02:03.787 --> 02:08.312
And then I went to camp also at Orleans.

02:08.593 --> 02:23.792
And then I lived in two places in Winchester and Austin, and I lived, I went to Harvard for four years as a graduate student, two.

02:23.812 --> 02:25.895
And I lived in San Francisco.

02:25.915 --> 02:28.238
I lived in Seattle for seven years.

02:29.539 --> 02:31.622
I lived, or six rather.

02:32.513 --> 02:59.387
Now what, are you a chiropractic sort, or has this been circumstance?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.069
How can I deny that?

03:01.353 --> 03:08.203
I see here a 200-acre... I see the quintessence of permanence here.

03:09.064 --> 03:13.250
I hope to make this my last stop, but you just never know.

03:13.710 --> 03:18.617
I seem to be... Do you crave permanence to it?

03:18.858 --> 03:20.660
Maybe that's too strong a word.

03:20.820 --> 03:24.606
I do until I get it and then I move on.

03:25.006 --> 03:25.907
Isn't that strange?

03:26.688 --> 03:29.553
It's contradictory, of course, but you understand what I mean.

03:29.573 --> 03:30.634
It's sort of like a young, barren clone.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.952
And it really looks like you're digging in here, though.

03:34.313 --> 03:36.074
Yeah, and it's exhausting.

03:36.435 --> 03:36.995
It's exhausting.

03:37.015 --> 03:42.541
This was two years' worth of work, and we didn't intend it to be.

03:42.781 --> 03:49.848
We thought it was, we were told by our magnificent architect that it was going to take six months.

03:49.888 --> 03:59.137
It ended up taking the actual renovation, taking three times that, taking a year and a half, and the price was doubled.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.279
So that's a renovated house over there?

04:02.170 --> 04:06.355
Everything was wonderful.

04:07.156 --> 04:08.318
We renovated it.

04:08.338 --> 04:11.101
How long was that?

04:11.121 --> 04:11.341
1824.

04:11.361 --> 04:12.263
Great thing about that.

04:12.863 --> 04:31.907
Something that I discovered about the house, which I think may not have been known since it was built, is that if you look at the original footprint of the house, all of the dimensions, not all of them, but many, are 18 by 24 or something of that.

04:32.663 --> 04:37.250
five by threes, six by eight, or whatever.

04:37.270 --> 04:37.911
It's considered.

04:38.572 --> 04:46.424
And if you add up the square footage of the footprint, the original portion of the house computer is an addition.

04:46.444 --> 04:50.110
It's 1,824 square feet.

04:50.310 --> 04:54.276
Architects then were also mystics.

04:54.296 --> 04:57.701
They were actually just mystics.

04:58.943 --> 05:00.906
They did things like that.

05:00.926 --> 05:01.607
And it may be that

05:01.992 --> 05:08.960
Since 1824, no one was building that in Manhattan, but I discovered it in doing the renovation.

05:08.980 --> 05:13.105
There are a couple of things I want to cover.

05:13.125 --> 05:18.751
Again, I guess I started with, we talked about the number of books, four novels, two questions of stories.

05:18.791 --> 05:21.995
You're perhaps at mid-career, maybe.

05:22.996 --> 05:23.637
Where do you see it?

05:23.777 --> 05:30.505
I mean, do you see it as a corpus, I guess, is one way of doing it?

05:30.525 --> 05:31.746
I see it as

05:34.105 --> 05:36.188
I was always trying to do better.

05:36.388 --> 05:37.670
That's the main thing.

05:40.514 --> 05:49.968
It's somewhat disappointing that when you look back, you see that this is what you've done over a period of years, and this is all you've come out with.

05:49.988 --> 05:53.473
And yet, you expect each time to do better.

05:54.094 --> 05:59.101
And then you look back, and eventually it will be the best that I can do.

05:59.522 --> 06:02.526
And then we'll have to stand for what I've done.

06:03.383 --> 06:17.256
I have until this point, and I hope that it continues that way, to see each book that I write as kind of just practice for the next.

06:17.276 --> 06:24.142
And I don't, for instance, people have asked me this a million times.

06:24.302 --> 06:25.664
I say, do you reread your own books yet?

06:26.585 --> 06:27.025
I never do that.

06:27.045 --> 06:32.530
As much as I may deeply love the characters in the book,

06:33.202 --> 06:43.378
or the book itself, as I'm writing it, as devoted as I may be, after I've written it, it goes on the shelf and I never get it again.

06:43.398 --> 06:43.538
Really?

06:43.558 --> 06:43.618
No.

06:43.638 --> 06:45.341
Did you read it?

06:45.361 --> 06:46.462
No.

06:46.723 --> 06:49.667
I did a couple of things.

06:49.687 --> 07:01.285
What I do is when I go on a book tour or do that kind of thing, I either give a lecture or a speech, and it's quite exhausting in that

07:01.990 --> 07:13.220
I believe it as a point of honor, or I have believed until now, I think actually exempt myself from this, but it has to be a point of honor not to give the same speech or lecture twice.

07:13.340 --> 07:26.832
Because I remember from having been in college and graduate school, what that's like, to get people who are literally dead on their feet, or almost literally dead on their feet, and they come up and they drone on.

07:26.852 --> 07:30.175
So that whenever I do the lecture or speech, I tend to make them do it.

07:30.796 --> 07:38.047
We go to a 14 city book tour and give 25 different things like that.

07:38.087 --> 07:38.988
It's exhausting.

07:39.008 --> 07:41.812
It takes a lot of time to come up with.

07:41.832 --> 07:49.383
So what I've done, for the last tour, I had a body that was always changing.

07:49.403 --> 07:56.334
It was never the same thing twice, but there were certain things that were repeated, different stories that I told.

07:56.414 --> 07:59.318
And if I go on a book tour for this book,

07:59.821 --> 08:01.423
What, will you talk about the writing of the book?

08:01.463 --> 08:04.608
No, no, I hate to talk about it.

08:04.628 --> 08:06.892
I haven't questioned you at all about the book.

08:07.312 --> 08:15.605
Again, it seems novelist for me, the toughest, the most challenging, but the toughest.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.987
I hate to talk.

08:17.267 --> 08:21.814
My job is to read the book, really, and it's stupid of me to try and ask you, and I haven't.

08:21.854 --> 08:29.085
I try and stay away from it, and then you'll see when I write a piece, I'll discuss the book at some length, you know,

08:29.707 --> 08:32.570
But, you know, I am interested in the character.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.932
I hate to talk about it.

08:34.952 --> 08:36.394
I'm really interested in the body of work.

08:36.414 --> 08:44.982
I did an interview with Nadine Mortimer a couple of months ago when she was in Cambridge doing the Morton Lectures.

08:45.122 --> 08:49.727
And she said that everything, she feels that everything she does is almost the same work.

08:50.648 --> 08:57.835
But she said, you know, you think you've written about it, but then you walk around, it's like looking at a sculpture, looking at it from a different angle.

08:58.196 --> 08:59.697
It's almost all the

09:00.098 --> 09:03.924
works are, looks at the same work.

09:03.944 --> 09:04.986
She quoted, who did she quote?

09:05.006 --> 09:06.468
Which photographer did she quote?

09:07.029 --> 09:08.251
Which sculptor?

09:08.371 --> 09:10.475
All these pieces are the same work.

09:10.755 --> 09:12.458
I mean, I forget who was.

09:12.859 --> 09:14.782
There's two things about that.

09:14.882 --> 09:16.204
I've noticed this all the time.

09:16.324 --> 09:27.102
One is that you have to really, you're in good shape if you impress people simultaneously as being both, as being, quote,

09:28.060 --> 09:36.668
writing the same thing over and over again, and secondly, as being astoundingly different from book to book.

09:36.688 --> 09:39.170
And what you want is both of those things.

09:39.190 --> 09:48.758
Because one is a consistency of integrity and vision and skill, and the other is a tremendous variety and breadth of imagination.

09:48.778 --> 09:57.426
So I like it when people say, oh my goodness, you know, this book is about, as if it were about a flying horse, and it wasn't about

09:57.693 --> 09:58.574
justice, really.

09:59.375 --> 10:08.246
And then this book is about a guy, a criminal, who has to flee to have to flee to Brazil.

10:08.927 --> 10:13.512
And then this one is about a family who becomes a socialist.

10:13.532 --> 10:18.118
And this story is about an Indian woman in Mexico.

10:18.619 --> 10:23.705
And this story is about an old, a four-year-old Russian boy, whatever.

10:24.286 --> 10:26.248
And if they think that you're

10:26.870 --> 10:28.011
It's amazingly different.

10:28.031 --> 10:39.702
You have tremendous versatility, and at the same time, there's another set of thought, which is the themes are the same, and the concerns are the same, and the gravity is the same.

10:39.722 --> 10:44.047
Well, is it an exploration for you, when you're writing?

10:44.067 --> 10:50.113
If you pretty much have a sense of where it's going, I mean, is it an exploration?

10:50.453 --> 10:52.955
Are you learning something as you go along, I guess?

10:52.975 --> 10:54.717
Oh, yes, but on the other hand,

10:54.983 --> 10:59.668
I've said this before, but I certainly don't want to say anything.

11:01.050 --> 11:01.651
This is really true.

11:02.432 --> 11:15.026
What I do, in terms of technique and approach and philosophy, is I always start out with the very last sentence of the book.

11:15.567 --> 11:16.948
That's how I write a book or a story.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.152
I have the last sentence.

11:20.172 --> 11:23.556
And then it's as if the last sentence were a rock.

11:24.667 --> 11:28.832
and I take it, and I throw it as far as I can, and then I go to it.

11:29.433 --> 11:36.000
And I can go left, I can go right, I can go down and up, I can make circles, detours, it doesn't matter.

11:36.401 --> 11:51.058
I have, I know where I'm going, I know where I may be at, and so I'm free, you know, to have, who was it, was Baudelaire who said, live like a bourgeois so you can write like a wild man.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.302
This discipline, this knowing the point of age,

11:54.586 --> 11:57.890
allows me to take tremendous discourages if I want.

11:58.410 --> 12:02.535
If I know I'm never going to get off the track and just know exactly what I'm going to do.

12:02.995 --> 12:05.378
And that's a combination of both freedom and discipline.

12:05.398 --> 12:07.520
Do you know where the story is ending up?

12:07.540 --> 12:08.141
Yeah.

12:08.221 --> 12:12.946
I mean, I heard it was the last sentence, but do you ever change the last sentence?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.248
I don't think so.

12:14.268 --> 12:14.988
And you hold to it.

12:15.649 --> 12:16.190
Yeah.

12:16.210 --> 12:19.694
Well, let's say the last sentence is more or less what the book is about.

12:20.214 --> 12:22.637
I mean, it is what the book is about.

12:22.657 --> 12:23.838
The last sentence of this book.

12:24.139 --> 12:24.559
Yeah.

12:24.893 --> 12:28.377
I'll read it to you.

12:28.797 --> 12:32.521
I'll read it to you.

12:33.762 --> 12:34.723
I'm sorry.

12:38.567 --> 12:41.190
One of these I'm going to ask you to inscribe to my editor at Holt.

12:45.695 --> 12:49.479
All this time, my heart has told me nothing but to love and protect.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.263
The message has been strong through the twists and turns, and it has never varied.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.556
So, you know, that's just what I told you about.

12:55.596 --> 12:58.799
To protect and to protect and to protect.

12:58.899 --> 13:00.680
I was born to protect the ones I love.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.645
And may God continue to give me ways to protect and serve them, even though they are God.

13:06.405 --> 13:11.610
And that's the sentence that I have in the end.

13:11.630 --> 13:15.694
That's how the book was born, with that passage.

13:15.714 --> 13:17.115
Is that the process for you?

13:17.215 --> 13:20.358
Born with the end.

13:20.398 --> 13:21.259
Does it come?

13:21.492 --> 13:25.296
I mean, as Shakespeare, do you pull it out of thin air?

13:26.937 --> 13:29.340
I don't, yes, I don't know.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.262
Poets, imagination, bodies, forms of things I know.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.906
I guess what it really is, where does it come from?

13:35.926 --> 13:43.974
It comes from the accumulated experience, concerns, fears, passions, loves that one has.

13:44.014 --> 13:50.520
And if you're thinking about them either consciously or subconsciously, you make them into

13:51.074 --> 13:52.816
and eventually into work.

13:54.319 --> 14:07.317
And that particular sentence is about what the book is about, which no one, again, no reviewer will get this.

14:07.337 --> 14:08.198
They won't understand it.

14:08.218 --> 14:13.947
Because it's not my place to come in to explain what my book is about.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.392
What that sentence is about is the Holocaust.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.815
And the sentence says, do you mind my quoting that?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.142
anything I say in quality.

14:24.523 --> 14:25.924
He's the protagonist.

14:26.144 --> 14:30.749
But I don't want to give away anything either.

14:32.931 --> 14:38.016
He says, let me continue to give me ways to protect them, even though they're dumb.

14:39.497 --> 14:49.667
And what I'm talking about here is not just the Holocaust of the Jews, necessarily, but any situation where people have been

14:50.761 --> 15:08.923
killed in that fashion or in other fashions where you lose the ones you want to, well, unnecessary, well, it's one thing if God takes them at the end of their lifespan or if they're ill for whatever reason, it's natural, more or less.

15:08.944 --> 15:14.290
But when they are present, it's unbearable and unendurable.

15:15.011 --> 15:19.857
And what this is about is how do you, how even after that,

15:20.512 --> 15:25.258
after you've lost, how do you deal with it?

15:25.278 --> 15:26.079
How do you continue to think of it?

15:26.099 --> 15:31.165
So you haven't finished the quote, you haven't finished it, so we'll see why that is, although very few viewers will.

15:31.826 --> 15:38.695
You're making that as a, you're hopeful that they get it, but you don't expect them.

15:40.697 --> 15:42.039
They won't.

15:42.059 --> 15:42.679
They won't.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.865
Most people will say this is a really funny quote.

15:46.885 --> 15:48.747
So did you start then with this

15:50.515 --> 15:53.219
This is something that you wanted to write about?

15:53.580 --> 15:55.403
It is a narrated book?

15:55.483 --> 15:57.506
Did you have this character?

15:57.526 --> 16:00.611
Did you have the sentence?

16:00.631 --> 16:02.514
Maybe it's a chicken and an egg.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.897
Well, let's see now.

16:06.220 --> 16:12.569
It started... How did it start?

16:12.790 --> 16:15.093
It starts with the last sentence here.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.536
It starts with the last sentence.

16:16.556 --> 16:17.417
850-odd interview.

16:17.903 --> 16:19.125
Somebody starts with the end.

16:19.225 --> 16:20.627
That's great.

16:20.647 --> 16:25.213
And the funny thing is, I also, I usually eat dessert before I eat dessert.

16:25.234 --> 16:25.374
Really?

16:26.195 --> 16:26.295
Yeah.

16:26.315 --> 16:27.977
And my wife thinks I'm absolutely out of my way.

16:27.997 --> 16:30.020
You read from left to right or from right?

16:30.040 --> 16:32.724
When I read Hebrew, I read from left to right.

16:33.565 --> 16:39.374
But I usually eat dessert first, and then I eat the rest of the meal.

16:39.394 --> 16:40.495
I prefer to do it that way.

16:41.116 --> 16:42.939
It's not because of a sweet tooth or anything.

16:43.299 --> 16:44.441
You have the treat first?

16:44.461 --> 16:45.382
Do you have a sweet dessert?

16:45.463 --> 16:47.185
No, I think dessert is the

16:47.468 --> 16:50.172
the least substantive.

16:50.212 --> 16:51.754
So I take the thing.

16:51.774 --> 16:53.417
Do I have the least substantive first?

16:53.437 --> 16:54.839
Oh, I also like it.

16:54.859 --> 16:56.141
Oh, okay.

16:56.161 --> 16:58.384
Essential.

16:58.424 --> 17:04.493
Just like a kid, I save the best part for the last thing when I eat, for example.

17:05.815 --> 17:09.942
And I think the dessert is less than the main course, so I have dessert first.

17:10.162 --> 17:16.311
I like dessert, but I want to put things in a proper perspective, so I eat them.

17:17.033 --> 17:18.976
you can see with me at lunch.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.508
Although this book, strangely enough, I hope it doesn't signal the end of my career.

17:26.548 --> 17:29.373
In other words, I might be hit by a boss or something.

17:29.393 --> 17:33.379
But this book, I think I was deserved, and yet it was certainly not first.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.903
So that's out of the pattern.

17:37.045 --> 17:37.666
Do that again.

17:38.207 --> 17:39.289
This book is dessert?

17:40.050 --> 17:41.252
Yeah, this is the dessert.

17:41.372 --> 17:43.596
The book, the whole book?

17:43.616 --> 17:43.716
Yeah.

17:45.164 --> 17:49.730
So much of the Great War was like, to me, sort of like a giant roast of ox.

17:50.871 --> 17:58.260
And I had a kind of spit, sizzling, all kinds of seasonings and everything like that.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.842
Vegetables with it on.

18:01.043 --> 18:06.029
And this is like a chocolate chip.

18:06.049 --> 18:07.952
It's just entirely different.

18:08.052 --> 18:08.993
The same theme.

18:09.093 --> 18:12.297
To continue the metaphor, it's part of the same meal, though.

18:12.357 --> 18:12.798
That's right.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.800
And the same themes in it.

18:15.640 --> 18:23.990
methods the same, it's identifiable as if it's something that's consistent with my concerns.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.636
That's almost exactly what Nathan Bordemar said a little while ago.

18:28.656 --> 18:31.379
I mean, we're talking about it and looking at it from it.

18:32.621 --> 18:34.824
Instead of looking at the front of it, we're looking at the side of it.

18:35.705 --> 18:36.205
Yeah, that's it.

18:36.466 --> 18:41.352
Or in a gastricology.

18:41.372 --> 18:42.373
You must be getting hungry.

18:42.995 --> 18:46.660
Let's schedule another 10 minutes.

18:46.680 --> 18:51.466
Okay, I'm going to ask you, maybe if you sign these here, I don't want to bother you for sure.

18:51.546 --> 18:52.607
Are we going to come back here?

18:52.968 --> 18:55.030
I mean, it depends on what time do you want to go.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.436
I should leave the hour, I would think.

18:59.876 --> 19:01.398
I've got plenty of material, by the way.

19:02.960 --> 19:08.127
Well, maybe you just want to come back and I'll sign it.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.849
Okay, that'd be great.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.192
You did say that

19:13.370 --> 19:18.155
You approach every book as if it's present to the next one.

19:18.175 --> 19:22.900
So every book is almost a penultimate book, is that right?

19:22.960 --> 19:27.205
It's like being an athlete.

19:28.346 --> 19:33.451
When you're an athlete, since when do you think about your previous performances?

19:34.412 --> 19:37.876
You only think about breaking the record.

19:37.896 --> 19:40.879
If you're a high jumper and you've jumped

19:41.180 --> 19:45.606
12, I don't know what the records are now, but let's just say 12 feet.

19:45.626 --> 19:49.070
I think it's a lot more than that.

19:49.090 --> 19:51.573
But let's make it a runner.

19:51.593 --> 19:55.057
You brought up a four minute mile.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.120
You're not thinking about that.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.144
That four minute mile means nothing to you anymore.

20:01.025 --> 20:07.893
Because if you run another four minute mile, you must run better than a four minute mile.

20:07.913 --> 20:09.736
So you're not thinking of your previous performances.

20:09.996 --> 20:10.917
You only want to do better.

20:11.909 --> 20:20.299
In terms of work, a previous book was a main course, it was an entree, this is the dessert.

20:22.021 --> 20:27.848
So will the next book be a main course, an appetizer, or what?

20:28.588 --> 20:35.196
The next book is, I think, is going to be, it all depends on the timing, a short story.

20:35.697 --> 20:40.262
So that's kind of a stepping outside, and that's what

20:41.018 --> 20:46.326
I don't know how you'd class that.

20:46.986 --> 20:49.831
I guess there's separate tracks for novels and short stories.

20:50.892 --> 20:56.240
And so in terms of the short stories, the next book, well, depends on what happens and isn't done yet.

20:56.580 --> 21:02.128
Is this exhausting work for you, or is it, no, no, this is what makes me able to continue?

21:03.390 --> 21:04.271
That's another thing.

21:04.291 --> 21:09.478
I frequently hear writers talk about how taxing it is to write a book.

21:09.498 --> 21:10.620
For me, it's taxing

21:11.377 --> 21:12.738
pay taxes.

21:12.758 --> 21:14.160
It's also taxes to move.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.543
To move on those goddamn books.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.504
Writing is easy.

21:17.524 --> 21:20.026
Moving them is a difficult part.

21:20.046 --> 21:30.057
I find it difficult to do things like that, but to write it is the breath of life.

21:30.197 --> 21:31.278
It's the easiest thing.

21:31.298 --> 21:33.260
It's pure enjoyment.

21:33.501 --> 21:34.141
It's not worth it.

21:34.562 --> 21:39.527
I don't feel guilty about too many things, but one of the things I do feel guilty about

21:40.317 --> 21:47.367
is that I actually get paid for doing what I would do anyway, and that's what I'd love to do tomorrow.

21:47.387 --> 21:50.952
I mean, that may sound trite, but it's absolutely true.

21:50.972 --> 21:53.096
That it doesn't feel like work, that's all I've worked.

21:54.277 --> 22:01.648
I would do it anyway, even if I were to have a job, you know, there's a shoe sale.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.008
I would do it.

22:02.028 --> 22:05.173
Of course, many people don't.

22:05.193 --> 22:08.618
It's the kind of thing they can do, even if you don't make money.

22:08.638 --> 22:10.020
And I, luckily, I think that's what I'm doing.

22:11.350 --> 22:22.342
And then let's just talk briefly then about the time, maybe you can compare the satisfaction that you get from writing your books with the satisfaction that you get from your journal.

22:22.362 --> 22:23.363
Obviously you enjoy it.

22:24.605 --> 22:26.907
I enjoy it, but it's a different thing.

22:27.608 --> 22:28.549
It's a totally different thing.

22:28.589 --> 22:29.710
People wrap vision.

22:29.730 --> 22:36.217
The thing about a book is that what deservedly gets more attention as well.

22:36.237 --> 22:40.242
You get wider attention with journalism.

22:40.262 --> 22:41.323
One might have more of an effect.

22:41.641 --> 22:43.844
But you get the implies right away, too, don't you?

22:43.864 --> 22:44.365
Yeah.

22:44.385 --> 22:46.027
And that is a kick, isn't it?

22:46.047 --> 22:46.448
You do.

22:46.588 --> 22:57.424
And when you influence policy, then I suppose that's the reason one does it, is to try to bend things in one way.

22:57.444 --> 23:10.062
But those are superficial little words that they don't weigh as heavily as writing a book and knowing that this will be in libraries throughout the world.

23:10.649 --> 23:15.356
or after you're gone, somebody wants to name it someday.

23:16.798 --> 23:20.503
Somebody can pick it up and see what you did.

23:20.523 --> 23:21.985
And it doesn't really happen with this paper.

23:22.005 --> 23:26.631
In fact, it's so many people who said something.

23:26.671 --> 23:32.539
Somebody that was going to see recently said, who cares about walking with me?

23:34.662 --> 23:38.408
I mean, the newspaper stuff, that's temporal satisfaction.

23:38.508 --> 23:40.150
Writing pictures is different.

23:40.552 --> 23:51.227
But just the same one that I talked about, how you have the concentration in your own track at the same time you kind of pay attention to what's happening with the external signal.

23:51.247 --> 23:55.232
For me, that's kind of a healthy balance between one and the other.

23:55.993 --> 23:56.794
I have the newspaper stuff.

23:57.756 --> 24:01.220
I love to have a piece in the Wall Street Journal.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.365
They run me at the top of the editorial page and put me in the cover.

24:05.306 --> 24:09.732
It makes you feel wonderful and when I, you know,

24:10.353 --> 24:15.841
people would go and talk to the political figures and prime ministers and stuff like that.

24:16.382 --> 24:21.088
That always was as exciting as that.

24:21.108 --> 24:26.336
And at the same time, I was also the part greater than the woman that we had.

24:26.356 --> 24:27.217
How did that come about?

24:27.237 --> 24:34.347
Is it something you sought out, or was it... Well, we were beginning to talk about it when I was in college.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.410
I knew that I was going to be a writer.

24:36.430 --> 24:39.094
I knew from a very early age.

24:41.200 --> 24:54.176
When I was in college, I looked about and I saw that the publishing industry in the literary world was beginning the process of destruction.

24:54.196 --> 24:58.422
One thing about me is that I always looked for a very long term.

24:58.442 --> 25:01.426
I looked at things in the long run.

25:02.367 --> 25:08.895
For instance, 10 years ago, I began warning that Russia was going to go move to the

25:09.584 --> 25:12.848
to sort of a revanchious position.

25:13.669 --> 25:15.090
And I still say that.

25:15.110 --> 25:19.916
And I expected it to take 10, 15, 20 years, but I think it's going to happen.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.879
I look at things in a very long time.

25:23.380 --> 25:38.477
And back then, as a young student, I looked around and I saw the blur in the world, which was in America anyway, and I felt like the rest of the world was relevant to what I do, particularly.

25:39.014 --> 25:42.539
with the process of disintegration.

25:42.579 --> 26:01.728
So I said to myself, if I'm not going to be taken with it, because this is my main passion, this is my passion in my life is to write fiction, then what I have to do is I have to have two passions.

26:01.748 --> 26:08.498
I went to graduate school to study political science, diplomacy, economics, war, and let the record show that

26:08.849 --> 26:12.594
There were two stacks of fauna bears in the middle of the floor.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.835
Take a look at those books.

26:14.035 --> 26:17.700
I saw two Kissinger books when I came in.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.063
The others there was David McCullers.

26:20.403 --> 26:22.766
Oh, that's a very history.

26:23.167 --> 26:25.349
I just can't see around the corner.

26:25.549 --> 26:30.055
Military intelligence is my field.

26:30.395 --> 26:33.739
I studied very hard.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.280
I did well.

26:34.721 --> 26:35.802
I worked in that.

26:37.182 --> 26:44.309
Essentially, my strong point is military analysis.

26:44.329 --> 27:00.184
I can analyze the order of battle, and therefore the chances of one country as opposed to another, or one alliance as opposed to another, and I can do that as well.

27:00.725 --> 27:01.906
So I have two careers.

27:03.668 --> 27:06.210
Since that time, I've wanted to have two careers deliberately,

27:07.490 --> 27:19.663
One of the beauties of that is you get independence in each one because you know that if you blow it in one because you stand for what you believe, then at least you can have a lifeboat in the other.

27:21.264 --> 27:31.095
So it turns out that in both of them I've done exactly what I wanted to do and I've been unspoken to some of the stuff I see no virtue in that in itself.

27:31.515 --> 27:36.400
But what I've done is I've been true to myself for both of them and I've gotten

27:37.173 --> 27:38.815
big knocks.

27:38.835 --> 27:50.426
But it's okay, because when I get, when I'm counted on one, I sort of retreat to the other, and I wait until it cools down a bit, and then I go back to the other, and they're mutually supportive.

27:50.446 --> 28:04.840
And if that has turned out to have been a good strategy, I would say that anyone who wants to be a writer, if they have that call, should absolutely make sure that they get themselves a lot of professional.

28:04.860 --> 28:06.522
And no, it's only recently

28:06.991 --> 28:08.753
that it has been otherwise.

28:08.773 --> 28:24.794
You look back to history, you see, Shakespeare, after all, was a theater impresario, and Dante was a diplomat, and Somerset Mullen was a doctor, and Chekhov was a doctor, and Carlos Williams was a doctor.

28:24.894 --> 28:26.196
I just mentioned those three.

28:26.496 --> 28:34.146
I did an interview with Oliver Sacks in this week's column, which is in Worcester today, and I mentioned that he follows in the tradition of Chekhov, Rabelais,

28:35.560 --> 28:38.564
Arthur Conan Doyle, William Connick.

28:38.664 --> 28:42.128
And then diplomats.

28:42.629 --> 28:45.713
Washington Irving served as an American constant.

28:46.534 --> 28:48.616
But I don't think there were any professional American writers.

28:48.656 --> 28:52.501
He may have been the first professional American writer.

28:55.124 --> 29:01.973
But it was a phenomenon that professional writers

29:02.898 --> 29:14.154
but only arose after the Industrial Revolution enriched the economies of the Western world to the extent that you could afford specialties and things.

29:14.174 --> 29:22.045
And to the extent that there was a market for reading books and articles, then you got the professional writer who did nothing but write.

29:22.065 --> 29:32.179
And it took a while until you got to the state that we're in now, where you have writing school, where you go to a writing school, you learn how to be a writer, and then you become a professional writer, and you don't know a goddamn thing.

29:32.783 --> 29:33.764
about anything.

29:33.784 --> 29:36.907
You've never done anything, you've never seen anything, you've never been anywhere.

29:36.927 --> 29:38.268
All you've done is try to be around.

29:38.289 --> 29:47.298
But strangely enough, one of the first requirements for being around here is that you know something about everything else, and that you've done things.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.420
Yeah, that's been John Updike's problem.

29:49.460 --> 29:57.508
It doesn't have to be on tape, but, you know, the guy just sat up there in his... He envies people who go out and do things.

29:57.548 --> 30:01.812
Well, I always thought from the beginning that not only the practical

30:02.669 --> 30:10.221
to ensure that I would be able to eat, and to make sure that I wouldn't have to live in the cracks and in the shadows all the time.

30:10.241 --> 30:13.766
But also, it strengthens what you do.

30:13.786 --> 30:23.381
I mean, if you think about it always, any great writer has been something else.

30:23.441 --> 30:31.393
That sort of ended with the modern age, and particularly now, when there's so much that we can afford

30:32.352 --> 30:35.376
writing into it.

30:35.396 --> 30:36.798
I just wouldn't do it on general principle.

30:36.818 --> 30:40.023
I wouldn't just be a writer.

30:40.043 --> 30:41.145
I wouldn't do it.

30:41.365 --> 30:47.293
I would insist upon having something else in which to try myself.

30:47.474 --> 30:48.696
In my own modest way.

30:50.658 --> 31:01.073
This part of the country certainly figures in your writing a lot, too, in your consciousness.

31:01.734 --> 31:02.275
My whole

31:03.453 --> 31:13.663
But it always seems that this, not always, but you certainly do manage to get this part of the country into your writing more often than not.

31:14.043 --> 31:15.584
It does, it's true.

31:15.605 --> 31:19.849
I'd say it did in the Winterstown, it did in this book.

31:20.009 --> 31:21.150
But the story is different.

31:21.170 --> 31:24.573
It requires fire every day.

31:24.693 --> 31:33.021
It's there, and now you see the models of the battleship over there.

31:33.575 --> 31:35.737
It was a battleship.

31:35.757 --> 31:37.279
How many people know that, right?

31:37.299 --> 31:38.500
That's a cruiser up there.

31:39.301 --> 31:40.762
That's a missile cruiser.

31:41.523 --> 31:42.844
That's a tugboat.

31:42.864 --> 31:45.807
Well, you were in the Navy.

31:45.827 --> 31:47.609
This was, I believe that's the Iowa.

31:47.649 --> 31:49.951
That was around, that was commissioned, recommissioned.

31:49.991 --> 31:50.532
That's right.

31:50.692 --> 31:54.215
After I got out, I was on the Missouri out in Long Beach.

31:55.136 --> 31:56.758
Wow, those things were great.

31:56.778 --> 31:57.619
Little battle wagons.

31:58.139 --> 32:02.063
That's a lead on a tape and at the same time predicted the outcome.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.761
of the South Atlantic War.

32:03.781 --> 32:03.941
Yeah.

32:05.343 --> 32:14.151
In fact, I don't know how to put this, but I have been correct in all the military sets.

32:14.231 --> 32:16.033
Is this what you studied in graduate school?

32:17.074 --> 32:21.398
That's exactly what I studied.

32:21.418 --> 32:23.640
You served in the Israeli Army, I think, is that right?

32:23.761 --> 32:24.281
And the Air Force.

32:24.301 --> 32:24.862
And the Air Force.

32:25.042 --> 32:25.562
Did you fly?

32:26.784 --> 32:31.408
I was on a pilot, but I was up occasionally.

32:32.165 --> 32:32.826
F-4s?

32:32.946 --> 32:35.691
A-4s and transports.

32:39.057 --> 32:44.166
But I was in the ground combat division.

32:44.186 --> 32:51.078
I was first in the infantry and then attached to the Air Force in what they call field security.

32:51.098 --> 32:52.300
I served on the northern border of Lebanon.
