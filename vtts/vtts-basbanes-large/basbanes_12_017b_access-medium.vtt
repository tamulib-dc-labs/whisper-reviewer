00:01.921 --> 00:07.186
It's like you're not a, you know, stop being a librarian at 5 o'clock.

00:07.206 --> 00:10.970
But no, I had planned to go to library school.

00:11.330 --> 00:12.411
I'm in a kindergarten teacher.

00:12.431 --> 00:16.976
It's the only profession I know of where people are happy when you borrow something, you know, when you take something.

00:17.296 --> 00:22.421
I mean, your day is made when you find something to give to a person.

00:22.441 --> 00:24.303
I mean, I don't know if the other profession is.

00:24.323 --> 00:30.409
The only thing is, it's professionally, I'm mortified when I have a book out beyond a few days.

00:30.575 --> 00:45.254
I feel like I have to go and explain it, and then people say, just, you don't have to pay the fine, I'll just mark it in and say, no, no, I'm not trying to say it, I'm just trying to explain why I had this book longer than I was supposed to have it, because it just seems like part of the obligation.

00:45.774 --> 00:59.772
No, I always have been interested in history, but I really, I've been a, because Massachusetts doesn't have kindergarten part of its school system, you know, it's a voluntary and additional,

01:00.005 --> 01:04.028
So I worked in a daycare center, just after I'd been in the Army and done a bunch of other things.

01:04.509 --> 01:06.370
And I worked in a daycare center, and I loved it.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.933
Anyway, I was in a paraprofessional position.

01:08.973 --> 01:15.038
I'd only taken a couple of courses, college courses at a community college out in the Berkshires.

01:15.578 --> 01:17.500
And I thought, I really love doing this.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.206
But even when I was young, it's so emotionally draining.

01:24.246 --> 01:29.370
This isn't a daycare center for children with all sorts of problems, physical and

01:29.857 --> 01:34.502
But it's also physically exhausting.

01:34.522 --> 01:35.923
It's hard, hard work.

01:36.124 --> 01:38.206
At first I thought it was funny.

01:38.226 --> 01:40.388
Everybody took care of those maps in the daytime.

01:40.408 --> 01:45.213
After a while I started looking forward, lying down after lunch for a few minutes.

01:45.233 --> 01:53.502
And then I thought, what can I do where this pleasure would be in it, but you could do this overextended period of time.

01:53.920 --> 01:59.066
And by that time, I thought, whatever you want to do, you have to go to college to do it.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.569
So I started going to school in New York.

02:02.009 --> 02:05.353
And Columbia had, at that time, a library school, a very small one.

02:05.714 --> 02:08.317
But it was really only really well known for two things.

02:08.357 --> 02:14.303
It was for training children's librarians and for the special program they had for rare book librarians.

02:14.323 --> 02:21.852
And somehow, actually, the thing that had never occurred to me is, it may still be the case, but it certainly was back in the 70s,

02:22.304 --> 02:25.629
children's librarianship is extraordinarily ideological.

02:26.210 --> 02:31.137
It's this idea, there are good books and there are bad books, and you better be on the side of the good books.

02:31.377 --> 02:41.612
And, you know, I thought the big problem of librarianship was censorship from the outside, but it seemed to me within this field, 90% of censorship was within.

02:42.032 --> 02:46.118
And for good, right-minded purposes, you know, to kind of

02:46.300 --> 02:57.574
improve people's lives and better their, but it just seemed not what I was, you know, it's not what I associate with being a librarian about.

02:57.634 --> 03:03.722
It's sort of like, you know, they're kids, but nevertheless choice and not trying to sort of judge everything.

03:04.302 --> 03:11.331
And so I got, I thought I couldn't deal with that, and then we had this special program.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.954
And Terry Bellinger was merely kicking everybody out.

03:13.974 --> 03:16.257
This is the first eccentric guy who ran this program.

03:16.490 --> 03:19.317
He was just pitching people over to the side, one after the other.

03:19.457 --> 03:25.331
And then he invited me, and it was so flattering where someone is sort of massacring the students.

03:25.992 --> 03:29.480
He's making these impossible assignments to convince everybody to quit.

03:31.124 --> 03:34.853
Just make up stuff that people couldn't do, because it was like...

03:35.255 --> 03:37.297
You know, it was like a boot camp.

03:37.857 --> 03:40.640
You know, it was going to be the people who got through were going to be tough.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.683
And then he said, why don't you come and join this?

03:43.983 --> 03:46.525
And for whatever reasons that are known only to him.

03:46.786 --> 03:47.666
And it was.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.349
It was extremely flattering under the circumstances.

03:50.409 --> 03:53.812
So I ended up in this bizarre program to change.

03:53.832 --> 03:57.135
Terry Bellinger, I've had four books published.

03:57.155 --> 03:58.877
And the first three, the books would come out.

03:58.937 --> 03:59.577
Did I tell you this?

03:59.757 --> 04:00.338
No.

04:00.358 --> 04:01.559
And I'd get the letter from Terry.

04:01.579 --> 04:04.722
You know, you've got this wrong on this page.

04:04.837 --> 04:11.406
So finally I said to him, for Christ's sake, I mean, why nitpick me now?

04:12.328 --> 04:15.812
How about reading the next one in TypeScript?

04:15.833 --> 04:16.253
Oh, sure.

04:16.293 --> 04:21.581
He read Splendor of Letters, and I mean, he found so much stuff.

04:22.061 --> 04:24.024
The book is basically flawless right now.

04:24.705 --> 04:26.828
I found a couple of little things that

04:27.415 --> 04:32.363
are so insignificant, maybe half a dozen things have fixed, but I really credit it to them.

04:32.503 --> 04:37.672
Reading that he gave the book and challenges you on things, it was unbelievable.

04:38.273 --> 04:50.453
He's basically a really nice guy, but he's so eccentric and so kind of non-socialized that it would never occur to him that saying,

04:50.703 --> 04:51.825
You've got that wrong.

04:52.146 --> 05:00.580
Anybody would take any personal, be personally hurt or insulted or anything other than an objective sort of like, it's like, you know, it's a mathematics problem.

05:00.601 --> 05:12.762
But, and also something, the only trick I learned from him, because we're both incredibly nearsighted, is if you're incredibly nearsighted, you can study things like type without...

05:13.045 --> 05:14.867
any magnifier or something.

05:15.188 --> 05:20.355
So if I had a nickel for every time I've seen him look like this to the book, which looks really bizarre.

05:20.695 --> 05:26.363
But if you're studying type design and stuff, it's this extraordinary gift.

05:26.403 --> 05:27.124
It's a gift.

05:27.144 --> 05:30.028
And he knows every trick and every tool.

05:30.589 --> 05:40.962
He's the guy that, they don't do this much anymore, but he's taught me every kind of book-back trick that he's learned, you know, the wet string in your mouth.

05:41.223 --> 05:42.124
Yes.

05:42.340 --> 05:57.735
You have a piece of wet string, and you put it in along the margin of page and close the book, and the wet string will sort of soften the page, especially for illustrated books, and then you can pull the whip-piece without any ripping noise.

05:58.296 --> 06:01.679
And I thought, where the hell did you find out that?

06:01.699 --> 06:05.543
Also, he had his own demonstration printing press.

06:05.563 --> 06:09.006
In fact, I rebuilt the printing press for him.

06:09.273 --> 06:14.278
You know, he's very, he knows lots of stuff, but he's not mechanically very adept.

06:14.298 --> 06:24.988
Um, uh, but, um, but he used, I mean, he used benzene, which is a good cleaning agent for, because, because, printing it, because, like, paint, practically.

06:25.729 --> 06:35.719
But, I mean, that guy must have been breathing benzene all day long for, like, I mean, he's like, he, I mean, he would have, you know, a factory worker would have not been exposed to more toxic chemicals.

06:36.070 --> 06:42.439
It's lucky he can sort of state a coherent... I know it's why Ove's hair fell out.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.567
But I know, but I swear, it's remarkable that man's still alive.

06:47.627 --> 06:50.171
He was so cussed and he probably can't die.

06:50.531 --> 06:52.094
But he is one of these great characters.

06:52.154 --> 06:52.394
He is.

06:52.554 --> 06:53.836
He is one of the great characters.

06:53.896 --> 07:02.449
And he's also this person that I know if he showed up, no matter what level I ever rise to in this, I feel like, arisen but as far as I'm ever likely...

07:02.648 --> 07:11.942
He just treats you like you're like the first day he ever... I know he'd give me a quiz about how... He'd come in and say, well, this is a modern printed book.

07:11.962 --> 07:19.433
But if we were looking at an old book, I know he had to ask me how the pages were made up and folded to make the pages.

07:19.453 --> 07:29.187
Do you feel a little prickling going up your back all of a sudden like you're being quizzed and you... No, because I think he kind of liked me because... No, because I give it back to him.

07:29.207 --> 07:32.031
I think it's because I was grown up and had done other things in the world.

07:32.163 --> 07:39.150
and didn't need to do this, you know, that he kind of liked it that these people, because everybody else kind of would, bow underneath that.

07:40.771 --> 07:53.383
The only thing I ever regret once is that he, once our class was supposed to meet for a week, our class was maybe like forty hours a week, single class, because he'd have all his printing and stuff.

07:53.403 --> 08:00.870
And I remember we were meeting in the evening, and I was working, living in New York, and I had a lot to do, and I was really mad because

08:01.340 --> 08:28.292
his office was all closed up, and he was there, but it was in the middle of something, you know, and he kind of, it just seemed to me impolite, because he had missed, you know, this, I couldn't, and it was the day he found out he hadn't been granted tenure at Columbia, and I thought, I'm, I'm getting, you know, into a huff because the class is met a half hour late, you know, this guy, at the time, I think he thought his life had been, I mean, he made a,

08:28.610 --> 08:33.895
He was the dean of the school and then moved the program to the University of Virginia.

08:34.115 --> 08:36.297
Oh, a new university professor.

08:36.477 --> 08:37.779
Yeah, that's right.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.300
They really landed on his feet.

08:39.781 --> 08:46.567
The school wrecked his career, then the school was closed down, and he was the only person standing.

08:46.587 --> 08:52.613
And he had put together all of these artifacts, what he called the Book Arts Press, and just uprooted and brought the whole thing.

08:52.693 --> 08:54.955
Yeah, but it's a wonderful program.

08:54.935 --> 09:06.505
But it is that kind of thing where you kind of have to step back and think, you know, what's happening to you personally at any minute is not, you may think it's the most important thing in the world, but not necessarily from the end.

09:06.965 --> 09:11.109
You ever meet that guy from UCLA Special Collections?

09:11.149 --> 09:14.311
He used to be great friends with.

09:14.872 --> 09:17.214
David Zeitberg who went to Huntington.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.837
No, he was at UCLA Special Collections.

09:20.857 --> 09:24.520
He died as a young guy about ten years ago.

09:25.259 --> 09:32.432
God, he's got an amazing thing like Jim Smith, you know, sort of like a, but they were characters, they used to travel around together.

09:34.075 --> 09:35.738
Well, it's a nostalgia for me.

09:35.758 --> 09:38.824
Well, listen, sir, I'm in violation of my meter.

09:38.844 --> 09:42.390
Oh, no, that's sort of like, let me, I just put Rosa...
