WEBVTT

00:05.330 --> 00:20.605
Okay, John Donatich, you're just talking about writers, professors, something that you had launched into what I thought was a very interesting observation about these savvy professors.

00:21.247 --> 00:21.347
Yeah.

00:21.327 --> 00:42.117
Well, I think one of the things that I've been trying to think about with the five imprint structure of the press, which is to say the core academic center, then there's the art list, which I think is at this point peerless, but there's a general interest list and a reference list and a small language list.

00:42.737 --> 00:49.427
The way I approach it is that I like to think that our activities should be

00:49.711 --> 00:53.555
almost as various as the university's activity.

00:53.575 --> 01:16.377
So most of our press will be kind of research-driven content that might make it into a graduate seminar, but there will be, once in a while, occasions for a book that's done for pleasure, whether it's the Raoul Jouffy's book on the Monde de la Vemme, which is my friend Dr. Lyon.

01:16.711 --> 01:27.494
of books that would have a little corollary in the activities of Yale as being, you know, kind of master's tea or a lecture by a visiting professor who comes in and addresses undergraduates.

01:27.534 --> 01:34.028
So I think the lighter side of our list has a real place and has a real mirror to what Yale does.

01:34.312 --> 01:41.564
I also think we want to be a one-stop shop publisher for a lot of academics.

01:42.005 --> 01:49.077
A lot of them don't have the old ambivalence about wanting to be public intellectuals as well as true scholars.

01:49.698 --> 01:52.943
So there are two aspects of their intellectual life.

01:53.123 --> 02:00.015
One is doing pure research, and then one is doing public intellectual work.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.639
They want to reach out to an audience greater than their peers.

02:03.180 --> 02:12.675
I think at Yale, with our academic and our general interest interest, we're more equipped to do both.

02:13.196 --> 02:16.561
I think that's an important thing to recognize.

02:17.122 --> 02:21.008
Would you say something about the writers themselves?

02:20.988 --> 02:42.270
There's a lot of people who sort of take a look at how scholarship matters in the world, and they reach out and look at the faculty at Yale itself, people like John Lewis Gattis, and you can name any number of them, who are often within the op-ed pages, who are often profiled in

02:42.250 --> 02:50.184
popular magazines, and his opinion and guidance is being had more a lot for the current affairs and things like that.

02:50.204 --> 03:04.528
He was a young scholar, political scientist that we called these past years, called Jacob Hacker, a real rising star, and he's here at Yale, and he operates in precisely that way, which is a really good, grounded scholarship,

03:04.508 --> 03:08.532
made relevant by commentary on current events.

03:08.632 --> 03:14.557
A question for you, and it's also one of the two areas that Frank Turner thought would be with Microsoft.

03:16.259 --> 03:24.326
And you think that this is really part of the mission of the university press, and that you think that Yale does manage to do in a couple of areas.

03:24.346 --> 03:33.655
And it isn't often the case, you know, especially with a globally sensitive press, as the press is and as the institution is, to more or less

03:33.972 --> 03:36.156
kind of support the curriculum.

03:36.216 --> 03:49.802
I have books that emerge from disciplines that are practiced at the university, in particular books, psychoanalytic books and child development books.

03:49.822 --> 03:52.808
There are real theories in those fields

03:53.007 --> 03:59.241
which are absolutely outstanding and almost emerge directly from programs that are taught here.

03:59.261 --> 04:05.295
And also, he said, by virtue of effect, there's a very strong psychoanalytic community in New Haven.

04:05.528 --> 04:07.410
And he said, we ought to look at that.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.573
That's kind of something you never hear anything about.

04:10.134 --> 04:17.442
And so I asked Janice, you know, maybe we could pull some figures on that and maybe give me some people to talk to that you didn't give me their name or something.

04:17.462 --> 04:20.266
I think it was on the publication committee.

04:20.386 --> 04:21.267
Child development.

04:21.287 --> 04:22.228
Caston, Ellen Caston.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.069
Right.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.411
Yeah, I think that's good.

04:24.431 --> 04:28.215
So, I mean, that's an interesting, kind of boring in a way, but not really.

04:28.295 --> 04:29.697
Because I do wonder.

04:29.677 --> 04:31.139
So it's a question.

04:31.159 --> 04:37.826
I mean, do you think that the press has an obligation to more or less support the curriculum?

04:38.527 --> 04:41.971
Yeah, I think that's definitely a part of our mission.

04:42.131 --> 04:52.783
And it's also, you know, not even, I don't even look at it as an obligation as a kind of, you know, what is at the core of the universities doing, David.

04:52.803 --> 04:54.925
And I think we should mirror the strength of Yale.

04:54.905 --> 04:56.467
I mean, you talked about psychoanalysis.

04:56.507 --> 05:00.411
It's probably one of the few interests who actually do still publish.

05:00.911 --> 05:04.135
It's a fairly, you know, a senior crowd that we publish right now.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.957
It's Kernberg and Sternberg.

05:06.277 --> 05:15.447
We just bought a new book by Lawrence Schengel, a guy who wrote Soul Murder and Father, Father, Can't You See Him Burning.

05:15.788 --> 05:21.153
And he, you know, like at least half of the population, lives in the West Side and New Haven.

05:21.814 --> 05:24.557
And he's a classic for his analysis.

05:25.195 --> 05:28.403
And the book is called Haunted by Parents.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.891
And we're publishing that in the fall.

05:31.911 --> 05:35.179
So I think your verb is better than mine, to say support the field.

05:35.219 --> 05:38.126
No, that's a mirror of the activity that's going on.

05:38.387 --> 05:39.249
That's far better.

05:39.269 --> 05:41.955
You know, I was thinking about this the other day.

05:41.935 --> 05:46.163
And I was looking over my calendar, and I go to three professional publishing meetings.

05:46.183 --> 05:48.748
I go to the AAP, which is the trade division.

05:49.269 --> 05:51.754
I go to the PSPA, which is the professional college division.

05:51.794 --> 05:57.425
And I go to the AAUP, which is the university press division of the trade organizations.

05:57.445 --> 05:59.910
And I thought, how different these three

06:00.447 --> 06:05.176
Mindsets are, philosophies of life and doing business are.

06:05.877 --> 06:12.830
As a trade publisher, we all have the bias that we know what people should like.

06:13.311 --> 06:18.000
And we are going to go out there and kind of promote

06:18.149 --> 06:20.011
our taste-making habits.

06:20.071 --> 06:21.873
This is what you should be interested in.

06:21.933 --> 06:24.916
This is a book, this is a writer, this is an approach that we feel you should know.

06:25.457 --> 06:30.062
A professional, Scali Press, approaches it completely different.

06:30.082 --> 06:34.387
They go out and they talk to professors and they say, we want to do a textbook on this.

06:34.407 --> 06:35.188
What do you need?

06:35.528 --> 06:36.349
What do you use?

06:37.250 --> 06:40.053
How can we develop something that's different and better than what you use already?

06:40.493 --> 06:43.216
And then they find the writer to execute that plan.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.798
So it's totally market-driven.

06:44.778 --> 06:47.826
The first imagines the market, promotes it.

06:47.846 --> 06:52.558
The second actually goes to the market and develops for it.

06:53.099 --> 06:58.753
And then the university press is completely irrelevant.

06:59.290 --> 07:05.059
And it's the purest kind of publishing, because we have proven over and over again that monograph sales are diminishing.

07:05.079 --> 07:08.905
And yet, at the same time, this is the work of true scholars.

07:09.106 --> 07:18.561
And so it's completely, all of its interests, all of its philosophies are completely sort of ignorant, willfully ignorant of the marketplace.

07:18.661 --> 07:21.045
And we're mirroring what the Academy does.

07:21.886 --> 07:26.293
We can't survive doing just that, but it's a definite part of what we do do.

07:26.273 --> 07:34.897
And so the other two philosophies have to complement and provide for that core academic obligation.

07:35.138 --> 07:37.785
So when you mention that book that you're publishing this fall,

07:40.060 --> 07:45.669
What's your expectation for it in terms of sales?

07:45.689 --> 07:49.335
That one, we'll probably sell about 2,000 copies of that.

07:49.355 --> 07:51.519
So sales are irrelevant.

07:51.939 --> 07:56.166
But there are other kinds of books that are even tougher.

07:56.206 --> 07:59.091
We'll probably only sell 300 to 500 copies.

07:59.111 --> 08:05.241
And they have to be generally supported by our endowment and other things.

08:05.710 --> 08:10.194
But at the same time, we do it because we feel that's our mission, and that's our covenant.

08:10.214 --> 08:19.263
But you do still feel that books that may only read two to five hundred, you still feel that it's correct to publish that book?

08:19.283 --> 08:19.844
Depending on the book.

08:19.864 --> 08:20.384
In today's world.

08:20.524 --> 08:22.907
I think we're... Good, thank you.

08:23.047 --> 08:33.477
I think the thing that we're paying a lot of attention to is what's going to be our electronic... When you're anticipating questions.

08:33.497 --> 08:33.777
Yeah.

08:33.942 --> 08:36.789
I've been doing a lot of thinking about this.

08:37.050 --> 08:44.910
I think we're getting ready to think about books being available in different forms.

08:45.191 --> 08:50.685
Part of the biggest existential question that it's asked us to do is to take a look at what absolutely needs to be a book.

08:51.138 --> 09:00.353
I think certain kinds of books are in an age of information where data and research is available ubiquitously.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.818
We're doing just fine.

09:04.439 --> 09:08.446
And it's pretty reliable.

09:08.646 --> 09:11.631
Is there a little tape in that?

09:11.651 --> 09:12.252
Oh, yeah.

09:12.232 --> 09:26.578
Now you need a voice reading machine that will just transcribe for you, with the working machine.

09:26.738 --> 09:28.622
I tried.

09:28.722 --> 09:30.966
You get 95% of it right.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.949
And it reads things as real words.

09:34.029 --> 09:36.191
It doesn't show up as typos.

09:36.271 --> 09:39.335
Sometimes it can make them very easy.

09:39.355 --> 09:42.318
I still do it the old-fashioned way.

09:42.338 --> 09:43.539
Go ahead.

09:43.559 --> 09:44.380
I'm sorry.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.181
All right.

09:45.681 --> 09:51.987
So I think it's essence to bring the bar up a little bit in deciding what ultimately needs to be a book.

09:52.007 --> 10:00.396
You know, I think that given electronic and the web world and how they're making information available so politically and

10:00.815 --> 10:04.223
It makes us wonder, what are the things that make a book a book?

10:04.243 --> 10:06.369
And there are a number of things that we think about.

10:06.389 --> 10:10.779
It's not just market, but it's also, is there a narrative drive to it?

10:10.839 --> 10:15.350
Is there something that you need to sit down and have unfold between covers for a year?

10:15.370 --> 10:17.676
Is there a symphony of argument?

10:17.943 --> 10:22.850
that would be impossible to keep track of electronically.

10:22.890 --> 10:31.162
There are certain books that have a kind of passion for research that's almost polemic.

10:31.462 --> 10:35.347
I think scholars in a community like this demonstrate this.

10:35.367 --> 10:40.795
When that passion for research is almost visceral on the page, that needs to be a book.

10:40.775 --> 10:54.363
When a master scholar is juggling 15 different arguments, theoretical and empirical, and weaving them together in a very artful way, completely interdependent, that needs to be a book.

10:54.383 --> 10:59.273
What doesn't need to be a book is incremental progress in a certain discipline

10:59.253 --> 11:02.917
that is going to be just a little bit ahead.

11:03.558 --> 11:05.140
It might as well be a journal article.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.141
How about dissertations?

11:06.662 --> 11:09.986
Dissertations, you know, we've been on two dissertations in the last couple weeks.

11:10.146 --> 11:12.789
It depends on quality, it depends on scope, it depends on maturity.

11:13.730 --> 11:22.020
I think that when a dissertation shows some promise of a scholar being able to manage any of those elements we talked about,

11:22.338 --> 11:23.921
then we go for it.

11:23.941 --> 11:37.523
What I'm trying to compile, and Frank Turner, I think Spence may have, and I know Morgan is, and it's just the process of having people tell you what they are.

11:37.543 --> 11:42.591
But important, the dissertations that were published that have proved to be very important, and are, if not very important,

11:42.571 --> 12:00.774
even if the dissertation itself doesn't become a great book, it does allow the scholar to turn and mention his own, which was published by the Ayer.

12:00.794 --> 12:03.457
So I'm going to try and find maybe a dozen of those.

12:03.617 --> 12:04.538
That'd be great.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.243
Because you know it's a loser.

12:08.263 --> 12:09.464
I've had jobs financially.

12:09.484 --> 12:10.806
99 times out of 100.

12:10.786 --> 12:13.549
And it's certainly not going to be the person's best work.

12:13.569 --> 12:14.631
It's the beginning world.

12:14.651 --> 12:19.737
But we do have this institutional obligation, I guess, to publish the roots of research.

12:19.757 --> 12:20.998
That's right.

12:21.439 --> 12:22.761
But not in every instance.

12:22.781 --> 12:34.375
And Turner said there was a time not so long ago, if you're a pretty great doctor or candidate, the expectation was, I mean, it's a good dissertation, that it would get published somewhere by a university press.

12:34.395 --> 12:36.037
And so that's not so much the case anymore.

12:36.117 --> 12:36.477
That's right.

12:36.697 --> 12:40.422
And he thinks, and a lot of people think that maybe this is where the electronic alternative

12:40.655 --> 12:42.518
has a real role to play.

12:42.538 --> 12:45.664
And I know Robert Darton feels that way too.

12:45.684 --> 12:46.926
Maybe this is the way.

12:47.787 --> 12:49.230
How do you feel about it?

12:49.270 --> 12:52.756
Columbia has been working on this particular initiative.

12:52.776 --> 13:03.154
We were talking about it just this morning, and there are all kinds of things to take a look at where all you would do is digitize a work, a file, a book, and then have it be available.

13:03.174 --> 13:05.177
The technologies are

13:05.157 --> 13:08.321
progressing at this point where there's a lot of different objects.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.944
So would you design it the way you design?

13:10.964 --> 13:12.806
I think you would have those kind of templates.

13:13.367 --> 13:16.230
Yeah, I think it would be a template design.

13:16.250 --> 13:21.056
You wouldn't just merely photograph a manuscript and put it online.

13:21.216 --> 13:23.439
I think you would have to typeset it into a sort of template.

13:23.459 --> 13:32.650
And I think the thing that's going to be interesting about this is that once you have done that, and it's still some aspect of our editing, some aspect of our design, of our development,

13:32.630 --> 13:38.217
And once that's online or available for you in a digital archive, you can go and print it.

13:38.237 --> 13:56.981
Print-on-demand, a book, a physical book when you need to do it, a hardcover book when you need to do it, a small rental hardcover book, a granular digital access version of it, an e-book, and sort of an audible downcast, which is something we're working with as well.

13:57.341 --> 13:59.124
We have a company called Caravan.

13:59.244 --> 14:00.826
I should let you eat your lunch.

14:02.368 --> 14:02.468
Okay.

14:04.034 --> 14:07.864
We're back online, but that's a whole other story for another time.

14:07.884 --> 14:13.960
If you'd like to read it...

14:14.159 --> 14:17.685
What did we talk about last year?

14:17.765 --> 14:21.391
We were talking about electronic publishing.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.056
Have you ever thought of doing a book that's entirely electronic?

14:24.256 --> 14:30.367
I think what we would do is we may get there eventually.

14:30.407 --> 14:35.155
I think more likely what will happen is a very short-run, hardcover book.

14:35.135 --> 14:46.692
with some digital long life to it.

14:46.712 --> 14:51.299
I mean, there's this theory of a long tail going on right now.

14:51.860 --> 14:54.924
And, you know, we're still waiting to see if that kick in, but there is no reason.

14:54.944 --> 14:58.049
Amazon's been a very important company for that.

14:58.069 --> 14:59.451
They can represent a higher list of being available somehow.

14:59.471 --> 15:01.875
You know, when you go to a bookstore, by definition, you can have a little bit of inventory.

15:01.895 --> 15:03.337
It has yet to be a book that's born digital in terms of the media press.

15:03.357 --> 15:03.437
Yes.

15:03.721 --> 15:04.322
Yes.

15:04.382 --> 15:06.365
It has not been.

15:06.385 --> 15:08.547
And you don't know when that might happen.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.951
I think in a few years it'll happen.

15:11.131 --> 15:15.897
Or at least I know sooner than that what will happen is some combination of things.

15:16.178 --> 15:22.306
But you don't see Yale following the route that, say, Columbia was still... Or Rice.

15:22.366 --> 15:25.991
You know, Rice University just completely went digital.

15:26.031 --> 15:31.418
And there may be an aspect of it.

15:31.478 --> 15:31.618
Really?

15:31.868 --> 15:34.935
Why are they failing so miserably?

15:35.195 --> 15:43.092
You know, I think they took a look at how their books were selling and where they were selling and that people would, you know, they're in certain disciplines that make it okay to go electronic.

15:43.132 --> 15:46.259
I think, you know, the sciences and a lot of economics and social sciences.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.402
Which makes sense.

15:47.883 --> 15:48.083
Yeah.

15:48.143 --> 15:50.188
They've already done that.

15:50.328 --> 15:52.172
I think when you're a humanist, though,

15:52.152 --> 15:56.638
Professor Humanity, the book is the work.

15:57.400 --> 16:03.468
If you're a scientist, if you're going to write a book, there are other reasons, not for career advancement, not for research.

16:03.548 --> 16:07.895
It's because you are polemicized, you are romanticized, you are popularized.

16:07.915 --> 16:10.178
It's not because you synthesize, it's not because

16:10.158 --> 16:17.013
But for a human is, the book is the work.

16:17.053 --> 16:21.242
That's what you're working for.

16:21.262 --> 16:22.986
Are you familiar with the Bible Jammadi essay from Frank?

16:23.489 --> 16:26.914
No, I'd love to see this.

16:26.934 --> 16:30.519
I don't know this at all.

16:30.819 --> 16:31.380
I don't know.

16:31.840 --> 16:38.069
You mentioned it a couple of times, and you couldn't recall the title.

16:38.149 --> 16:40.292
Oh, if you find the source, I'd love to read it.

16:40.312 --> 16:43.777
In fact, I actually thought that Bart would go on in his assessment.

16:43.797 --> 16:46.040
I'm very curious to track the track.

16:46.300 --> 16:50.366
He talked about donors to the press, and he gave me some thoughts on that.

16:50.526 --> 16:51.387
You know, whenever people

16:51.367 --> 17:00.378
One way to look at the Yale University Press is to look at the careers of, to this point, three directors.

17:00.398 --> 17:02.601
Now you've been there, what, two years, three?

17:03.422 --> 17:04.022
Three and a half now.

17:04.042 --> 17:04.803
Three and a half now.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.105
Yeah, very well.

17:06.405 --> 17:09.329
How would you like to see your... How would you like to stand, would you like to stand?

17:09.349 --> 17:13.934
Well, I think what I'd like to sort of think about is in a few ways.

17:14.255 --> 17:21.103
I think I'm trying to recognize and organize the press by...

17:21.083 --> 17:23.085
the fact that we have these five imprints.

17:23.105 --> 17:32.996
So I think there's a new respect for its complexities and the fact that we're five different kinds of publishers and that we have to operate within each of these conferences differently.

17:33.537 --> 17:34.238
That's important.

17:34.498 --> 17:45.150
Second, I think we're trying very hard to organize within the trade group and the academic group a couple of series I think that people do really good work.

17:45.130 --> 17:50.389
And one of the things I'm most proud of is I'm starting a new series called The New Republic of Letters.

17:51.533 --> 17:55.748
And we have a donor on the hook, and hopefully by the time you

17:55.863 --> 17:59.086
show your manuscript to us.

17:59.106 --> 18:00.848
We can write this in ink.

18:01.529 --> 18:13.141
But it's a wonderful builder who's going to give us several million dollars as a foundation from which we can draw to translate works, literary fiction and poetry and ballet and philosophy.

18:13.181 --> 18:13.582
That's great.

18:13.622 --> 18:14.322
Yeah.

18:14.342 --> 18:18.166
You know, I have a very good friend who's a Turkish editor working in France.

18:18.427 --> 18:23.592
And when we invaded Iraq, he called me up and he said, OK, hotshot, name me five Iraqi writers.

18:24.517 --> 18:26.140
And it couldn't even work.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.264
And it goes, okay, they made a dozen Arabic writers.

18:28.344 --> 18:30.608
And I got up halfway there.

18:30.809 --> 18:39.424
And I thought, you know, my bookshelves are cram-packed with translations in Spanish, French, Italian, Egyptian, Arabic, Egyptian.

18:40.306 --> 18:45.175
But I couldn't find anything from the Middle East except for Israeli writers.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.919
And I thought, this has to change.

18:49.939 --> 18:56.266
You know, this is a kind of ruleful ignorance.

18:56.346 --> 19:01.973
This is a refuse to know our enemies, humanize them, and this needs to change.

19:01.993 --> 19:10.362
So the idea was to actually begin with... Sorry, I neglected you guys for a little bit.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.063
I'm a little crazy.

19:11.083 --> 19:11.443
You want a coffee?

19:11.463 --> 19:11.904
I'd have a coffee.

19:11.924 --> 19:12.084
Regular?

19:12.625 --> 19:12.865
With coffee.

19:12.885 --> 19:12.985
Sure.

19:12.965 --> 19:21.196
And so the first person that we signed up is a Syrian poet named Adariz, who lives in Paris.

19:21.216 --> 19:25.101
And he's a wonderful, complex, lyrical, epic modernist.

19:25.741 --> 19:37.116
And so we're going to be doing a collection of his poetry, where you can sign up a wonderful Chinese novelist named Sam Shua, who is, it's like reading

19:37.417 --> 19:44.771
It's like reading Borges and Kafka in the middle, retelling Chinese folk tales.

19:45.052 --> 19:46.254
Fantastic stuff.

19:46.335 --> 19:49.000
And translation to be able to say that.

19:49.020 --> 19:49.240
Yes.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.124
Very little known here.

19:51.304 --> 19:59.340
And so this, I feel, is a true mission for the press to be a kind of global consciousness.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.524
Are you launching that now?

20:01.544 --> 20:02.145
Yeah, we'll do this.

20:02.606 --> 20:05.271
Probably the first book will be happening in a year and a half or two years.

20:05.291 --> 20:09.178
I think it's going to be a landmark translation series.

20:09.198 --> 20:11.001
Are you going to call it the New Republic of Letters?

20:11.021 --> 20:12.003
That's where it is right now.

20:12.023 --> 20:13.045
Yeah, yeah.

20:13.185 --> 20:14.908
New Republic of Letters.

20:14.928 --> 20:16.671
And I feel that in this country,

20:16.904 --> 20:43.806
fewer than two percent or less than two percent of the books published in this country are translations that's so different than that's all that's shocking and it's very different from what the rest of the world operates and in fact in scandinavia the number of translations are high from english and so there's a xenophobia about how we do it and there's also you know business logic the translations are expensive they're hard to do they're hard to market um hard to know about if you don't read a native language

20:43.786 --> 20:51.079
So we're going to build a sort of network of scholars, fluent, and translated fluent in the various languages, and then pull together.

20:51.740 --> 20:53.944
And is it all contemporary writing?

20:53.964 --> 20:58.532
No, I think it's going to be mostly 20th century, but we'll go backwards as well.

20:58.612 --> 21:03.381
Some classics that have never been translated, that need re-translating.

21:03.541 --> 21:05.845
Some writers have been poorly translated.

21:05.825 --> 21:13.335
Another series we're doing is the Yale Younger Playwrights, Yale Drama Series, which is kind of an equivalent of the Yale Younger Poets.

21:13.675 --> 21:15.497
So when is it?

21:15.778 --> 21:26.331
We just announced it, got a lot of press, and our first judge is going to be Edward Albee, and we have a million-dollar grant to fund this.

21:26.648 --> 21:32.583
and the Ornn Foundation.

21:32.623 --> 21:40.523
And so the winner gets... Is this going to be annual?

21:41.043 --> 21:46.330
And the winner gets a $10,000 prize and then a stage reading at the Yale Rep.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.453
So it's a whole Yale thing.

21:48.533 --> 21:49.434
I'm really proud of this one.

21:49.455 --> 21:51.117
When will the first one be announced?

21:51.137 --> 21:52.278
Probably next year.

21:52.559 --> 21:53.740
Well, maybe in town.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.301
Yeah, I think so.

21:54.321 --> 21:56.965
Because I am writing about the Yale Younger Poets.

21:57.005 --> 21:57.606
Right.

21:57.666 --> 22:00.790
This is a new...

22:00.770 --> 22:02.734
emerge from that?

22:02.794 --> 22:03.675
It's a model for it.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.098
Yeah, it's a model for it.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.461
The book suggested this.

22:06.481 --> 22:09.246
This is something where the money came to us.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.951
So this is one of those cases where the donor comes from with a good idea.

22:12.091 --> 22:13.634
The donor came along with money.

22:13.694 --> 22:14.496
We came up with the idea.

22:15.397 --> 22:17.481
So the donor wanted to do something good.

22:18.463 --> 22:18.764
Yes.

22:18.784 --> 22:19.525
And we came up with it.

22:19.585 --> 22:20.567
In both these cases, in fact.

22:20.952 --> 22:22.294
That's what happened.

22:22.314 --> 22:24.818
Well, that's the kind of thing we want to know more about.

22:24.939 --> 22:25.740
Yeah, yeah.

22:26.161 --> 22:29.246
And maybe the press hasn't done so much of that.

22:30.107 --> 22:31.309
It's certainly a priority for me.

22:31.589 --> 22:39.282
And here are two big events that are happening that I'm really proud of.

22:39.262 --> 22:44.671
Well, it's also a case, however, of those who might say, well, this is the donor calling the shark.

22:44.851 --> 22:45.032
It's not.

22:45.272 --> 22:45.432
No.

22:45.452 --> 22:46.995
It's the donor donating money.

22:47.015 --> 22:47.376
That's right.

22:47.596 --> 22:51.002
Where you come up with something that you'd like to do, a concept.

22:51.022 --> 22:51.162
Yeah.

22:51.482 --> 22:53.987
And then we develop it together.

22:54.147 --> 22:55.148
Yeah.

22:55.389 --> 22:55.990
Yeah.

22:56.711 --> 23:02.080
And, you know, as far as the public, you know, that donor wanted to do something loved

23:02.060 --> 23:05.487
I love things with translation because his wife is a translator.

23:06.029 --> 23:07.752
It was a natural fit.

23:07.772 --> 23:08.915
What was the amount of that?

23:09.476 --> 23:10.318
That was $3 million.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.144
It's not signed yet, but it's looking good.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.790
Are these like friends in Yale?

23:15.810 --> 23:19.417
This is a man who was Ted Margellos.

23:19.437 --> 23:21.081
He's a goose green magnet.

23:21.061 --> 23:44.381
and his daughter was graduating here from Yale, and so Yale knew about him, and when I talked to the director of development about ideas that I had, this is one of them, a little light went on, and I had a guy for Yale, and that's how it happened.

23:44.401 --> 23:48.845
You know, how often does that happen when somebody, this particular donor, you know, I'm talking about this specifically, did the donor want to give something to the press or something to the university?

23:48.865 --> 23:49.426
It's channeled your own way.

23:49.446 --> 23:49.566
Right.

23:49.546 --> 23:52.309
That's right.

23:52.409 --> 24:00.478
I think that's an answer to Frank Turner's comment, that basically, yes.

24:00.779 --> 24:03.502
So we've done a lot of the work.

24:03.562 --> 24:09.308
We've done a lot of proactive work ourselves recently.

24:09.548 --> 24:10.810
That's great.

24:11.310 --> 24:15.095
I'd like some detail on these, if I can, to get them in.

24:15.115 --> 24:17.157
They belong in that particular discussion.

24:17.407 --> 24:21.193
We just started another fund to honor Yavislaw Pelican.

24:21.213 --> 24:24.117
I don't know if you had the honor to leave.

24:24.378 --> 24:25.720
Is it still possible?

24:25.880 --> 24:26.240
He died.

24:26.501 --> 24:27.562
When did he die?

24:27.803 --> 24:31.268
He died about, gosh, just around the New Year.

24:32.310 --> 24:32.991
No, no, March.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.854
I missed that.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.536
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:36.716 --> 24:40.743
I think it wouldn't have been possible anyway.

24:41.143 --> 24:42.185
He was declining.

24:42.265 --> 24:44.308
I requested it last year and he was called it.

24:44.288 --> 25:11.629
What's nice about this is that we're making a film with his name, the Pelican Flax, full of works in the intellectual history of religion.

25:12.284 --> 25:20.564
I think he wasn't really seeing people.

25:20.624 --> 25:29.365
It's a discipline.

25:29.345 --> 25:33.012
I feel like I missed anyone boring once by about a month.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.836
A remarkable guy.

25:34.896 --> 25:37.641
I think he spoke like 16 languages.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.804
It's a funny story.

25:38.824 --> 25:48.062
One of my first weeks at the press, I remember it was a freezing day, and I was at my desk, and I felt a presence in the room, and I turn around.

25:48.042 --> 25:50.927
He's a remarkable looking guy.

25:50.947 --> 25:55.035
He was in his 80s, but he carried himself like he was in his 60s.

25:55.296 --> 25:57.299
And he just had these sprays in his eye.

25:57.319 --> 26:01.587
And he came in, and he looked at me very mischievously, and he said, I smell a slob.

26:06.156 --> 26:07.258
Oh, that's great.

26:07.438 --> 26:10.945
And I repeated this to him later, and he said, and that was upwind.

26:11.245 --> 26:12.166
Really?

26:13.187 --> 26:16.190
That's wonderful.

26:16.751 --> 26:18.893
Who was it?

26:19.634 --> 26:25.500
One of my... Actually, one of the girls, I think.

26:25.540 --> 26:32.588
She said, well, 1991, 1992, probably four or five books on the list.

26:32.868 --> 26:34.570
So 4,000...

26:34.837 --> 26:37.741
That's all.

26:37.821 --> 26:40.744
As a highlight.

26:42.006 --> 26:44.950
And I wonder, you know, what's the case now?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.812
Well, you know, it's interesting.

26:46.832 --> 26:48.935
I can give you these figures exactly.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.178
Which I've asked for, but I'm curious.

26:51.198 --> 26:57.085
In 2005, I actually showed it as a slide, because Tina Weiner did it as a point to the board.

26:57.165 --> 27:00.169
I think we had 12 books.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.514
that sold over 5,000 copies.

27:02.615 --> 27:03.275
In which year again?

27:03.295 --> 27:05.478
This past year, yeah.

27:05.658 --> 27:10.163
And then seven books over 10,000 copies, and then two books over 30,000 copies.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.484
Which were the two over 30?

27:11.564 --> 27:13.887
The Gombrich and the Fukuyama.

27:14.668 --> 27:15.549
The Gombrich?

27:15.769 --> 27:16.410
What happened?

27:17.091 --> 27:17.191
Yeah.

27:17.211 --> 27:18.372
Again, tell me about that.

27:18.612 --> 27:21.556
That was a great little story.

27:21.576 --> 27:28.283
Yeah, John Michael and I, John Michael had been following this for a while, and then at a London book fair,

27:28.263 --> 27:35.612
He took me to dinner with the original publisher, Dumas, and the granddaughter, Damage.

27:35.672 --> 27:38.355
A wonderful young woman.

27:38.575 --> 27:42.420
And we had like a four-hour dinner and just talked and talked about it.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.143
But the story of its publication, I think, is really wonderful.

27:45.363 --> 27:51.891
He wrote this in, and we can check the date on this, but it was in the middle 30s when he was about 26 years old.

27:52.175 --> 27:55.463
And there it was.

27:55.504 --> 27:57.348
He was a Jew in Vienna.

27:57.368 --> 27:59.514
The heat of history is on his way.

27:59.534 --> 28:01.419
And he had finished his doctorate.

28:01.439 --> 28:02.181
He didn't have a job.

28:02.622 --> 28:06.111
And he was trying to decide what to do with his life.

28:06.131 --> 28:08.918
And he took a summer job in a journal publishing house.

28:09.168 --> 28:17.981
And the editor who got him the job said, you know, if you read manuscripts for me, here is a proposal to do a kid's history of the world.

28:18.482 --> 28:19.083
And he read it.

28:19.103 --> 28:19.904
He says, you know, it's fine.

28:19.944 --> 28:20.685
I can do much better.

28:21.587 --> 28:24.591
And the publisher said, OK, you have six weeks.

28:25.473 --> 28:33.445
And for six weeks, he locked himself away from the library and reviewed everything he had read, which was pretty wonderful.

28:33.465 --> 28:38.432
And in the evenings, he'd see his girlfriend, which was to be his wife.

28:38.412 --> 28:46.261
And he would read it aloud to her, and she would correct it and say, that's condescending, that's patronizing, that's too complicated, that's not song-like enough.

28:46.622 --> 28:47.723
And they made it into it.

28:47.743 --> 28:48.604
It's wonderful.

28:48.804 --> 28:52.609
I've read the book aloud in manuscript to my daughter, Anna, in a tree.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.372
And it's a book to be read aloud to a young mind.

28:56.013 --> 29:03.762
Because what he does that's so infectious is that it's an invitation to do history, to understand why it's important.

29:03.742 --> 29:10.094
And it's got this sort of romantic awakening of a book lover, implicit in it.

29:10.675 --> 29:16.145
So you're teaching a young mind to care and to be molded by books and to be seduced by it.

29:16.265 --> 29:17.046
And it's timeless.

29:17.267 --> 29:18.229
Absolutely.

29:18.649 --> 29:25.041
He has this one little image that I love where he writes a little piece of paper and drops it down a well and looks over.

29:25.021 --> 29:42.092
and you can see the piece of paper lighting up at first, taking a blaze, and illuminating the walls of the cave, and getting darker and darker, dimmer and dimmer, and you don't have to look harder and harder at it, and supply some of your own imagination to make out one there.

29:42.553 --> 29:43.615
Yeah, you should.

29:44.036 --> 29:46.400
Yeah, it's a beautiful image.

29:46.420 --> 29:47.502
It's in the book.

29:47.954 --> 29:52.262
And he goes, that's a metaphor for doing history.

29:53.184 --> 29:57.953
So it was published in, I think, 20-something languages, but never in English.

29:58.053 --> 30:00.097
Because he was interesting why.

30:00.457 --> 30:05.727
He had this prejudice that the British, and he was really thinking about Brits versus Americans.

30:05.707 --> 30:06.828
at this point.

30:07.129 --> 30:13.537
He thought that the British history was too monarchical, and they wouldn't understand his view of the world.

30:13.557 --> 30:15.420
And I think it's a great little distinction.

30:15.440 --> 30:15.800
It's funny.

30:15.820 --> 30:16.521
Yeah, it is very funny.

30:16.541 --> 30:19.865
Because he didn't spend most of his life in England at the Warburg.

30:19.885 --> 30:23.130
It doesn't make any difference about publishing the book in that language in that case.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.211
Right, exactly.

30:24.231 --> 30:25.112
So what are we doing?

30:25.593 --> 30:32.001
But then late in his life, he decided to do it and translate it, and his wife was helping him.

30:31.981 --> 30:52.911
And then 9-11 happened in 2001, and I think he fell into a deep depression because it seemed to confirm something that he grappled with in the book over and over again, which is this sort of history progresses to a catastrophe, a moment of evil, and then recluse that the human spirit survives it.

30:53.212 --> 30:55.856
And I think he didn't want to tell that theme again.

30:56.577 --> 30:59.541
He didn't want to sort of struggle for that revival.

30:59.521 --> 31:05.011
And he was, at that point, I think he knew he was mortal, obviously.

31:05.893 --> 31:09.099
It's a very moving ending.

31:09.660 --> 31:15.091
But his wife and his granddaughter did a Yogan's life part to finish this.

31:15.191 --> 31:16.954
And it's a wonderful story.

31:17.896 --> 31:18.958
It is.

31:20.361 --> 31:21.563
Yes.

31:21.543 --> 31:26.574
You and John Nickell had your eye on it.

31:26.775 --> 31:28.378
Yeah, we had our eye on it.

31:28.398 --> 31:28.960
We bought the book.

31:28.980 --> 31:33.229
John Nickell left, and then Robert Baldock published it beautifully.

31:33.249 --> 31:36.156
He had to beat up the trades on it.

31:36.176 --> 31:36.717
It's natural.

31:36.697 --> 31:42.202
I think that people were, you know, didn't know about it or forgot about it.

31:42.282 --> 31:47.406
And I think the family liked it being with a reputable University Press House.

31:47.567 --> 31:49.068
People liked that.

31:49.288 --> 31:52.571
He's always been published by places like Fyden.

31:52.691 --> 31:59.037
Yeah, the great press, the New York Times wrote a wonderful article about it.

31:59.057 --> 32:01.158
Yeah, it was really fun.

32:01.178 --> 32:06.383
You know, this is to be continued, so you don't have to feel like you have to cover everything.

32:06.363 --> 32:22.263
It's actually not as simple as that, I think.

32:22.383 --> 32:29.131
I think they all have specializations, which they then, you know, work with them.

32:29.211 --> 32:33.817
We have a language editor, we have a history editor, two, three history editors, in fact.

32:33.837 --> 32:34.918
The art historian,

32:35.405 --> 32:46.480
I think what happens is, you know, like our literature editor, John Conco, will also do politics.

32:46.520 --> 32:59.176
He will also do politics and the history editor will also do some religion and the science editor will do some health and wellness and burning books.

32:59.777 --> 33:01.159
It's not so much of where

33:01.426 --> 33:08.082
Every single editor does have a specialization, but they're clear to move outside a little bit or across.

33:08.523 --> 33:11.610
And the nature of discipline and the nature of study is changing.

33:11.911 --> 33:14.076
It's increasingly cross-disciplinary.

33:14.477 --> 33:15.840
So the more you know, the more you know.

33:16.073 --> 33:33.137
And I think the better thing about, or an asset of being a generalist is that, at least for the trade list, not for the academic list, for the trade list, there's a sort of, you know, need to be a layperson, need to be educated.

33:33.157 --> 33:37.744
So you have that eye for, is the author successful in communicating to me?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.489
He's not a specialist.

33:40.509 --> 33:51.931
And Mary Nash, what she'd like to see in this book is a lot of attention to editors.

33:51.951 --> 33:54.235
And Polka would definitely be one.

33:54.255 --> 33:55.538
You thought Jonathan Brent, hadn't you?

33:55.558 --> 33:57.421
Jonathan, I heard.

33:57.441 --> 33:58.243
Yeah, good.

33:58.263 --> 33:59.445
I now need to follow it up with him.

33:59.425 --> 34:03.834
I understand that the Stalin papers are now coming, so I didn't have that.

34:03.914 --> 34:06.059
Oh, yes, that's another big issue.

34:06.119 --> 34:10.388
And he raised a lot of money from Hoover to do that.

34:10.889 --> 34:17.183
Well, you know, what a great coup that is for the press.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.686
You know, not everybody thinks so.

34:18.766 --> 34:19.307
I know.

34:19.642 --> 34:23.386
I thought that was a very... I said, well, what do you mean?

34:23.406 --> 34:26.389
He said, well, you know, we're talking ideological stuff now.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.371
It's quite astonishing.

34:28.391 --> 34:34.498
And he said he agreed with it, but you'd be amazed at how many people really question the propriety.

34:34.598 --> 34:35.879
Oh, I think that's absolutely right.

34:35.979 --> 34:36.680
Of the Yale press.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.081
You're totally alert to that.

34:38.162 --> 34:39.303
Oh, I know about it, yeah.

34:39.323 --> 34:42.206
I mean, this sort of was already in play by the time I got here.

34:42.346 --> 34:43.868
So it was sort of traditional already.

34:44.769 --> 34:47.151
Because they started publishing this up ten years ago.

34:47.131 --> 34:49.035
So I just interjected.

34:49.055 --> 34:52.541
I said, well, if there was a problem with that, why wouldn't there be a problem with the China stuff?

34:52.641 --> 34:57.631
I mean, I'm not getting into the issues that he would develop subsequent to that.

34:57.691 --> 35:00.195
But he said, no, no, we're talking politics.

35:00.215 --> 35:02.219
We're talking 20th century politics.

35:02.259 --> 35:04.042
You're talking art that's 3,000 years old.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.145
That's totally irrelevant.

35:05.165 --> 35:08.110
He said, you know, it's about...

35:08.090 --> 35:09.311
But I interrupted.

35:09.432 --> 35:19.123
Well, no, I think there is, you know, the issues are basically, you know, communism and, you know, and anti-communism and the U.S.

35:19.143 --> 35:26.733
left and its, you know, love for communism.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.815
And all of a sudden there's this

35:28.795 --> 35:32.879
a mother mold of material that has been made available.

35:33.019 --> 35:35.181
And much of it cooperates on its side.

35:35.341 --> 35:38.564
But it seems to me that that's the mission of the university.

35:38.584 --> 35:40.105
You don't judge it.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.907
You make sure it's accurate.

35:42.568 --> 35:42.888
You publish it.

35:42.908 --> 35:43.308
That's right.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.531
I don't see the problem with that.

35:45.691 --> 35:53.318
I mean, you know, it's sort of interesting because yesterday we had a couple of books that were at an editorial meeting that could be fairly controversial.

35:53.978 --> 35:56.641
And what is our position on advocacy scholarship?

35:57.061 --> 35:57.942
What do we do with that?

35:58.158 --> 35:59.720
That's a good one.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.702
That's a new phrase.

36:01.903 --> 36:06.749
Because there's a lot of scholars who are... Do we do any of that?

36:07.149 --> 36:07.289
Yeah.

36:07.309 --> 36:07.850
I'm sure we do.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.933
Well, I'm trying to think.

36:10.133 --> 36:16.060
One book that we signed up recently was a book on bankruptcy.

36:16.301 --> 36:19.845
And should bankruptcy not be an economic...

36:20.062 --> 36:26.271
you know, with social welfare, should it be a social morality issue?

36:26.391 --> 36:32.679
And should bankruptcy not be aided by a government?

36:32.759 --> 36:36.665
Should it be a kind of timeless American bootstrap?

36:36.685 --> 36:40.130
You know, it's almost oxymoronic, isn't it, to play advocacy scholarship?

36:40.150 --> 36:42.913
I mean, it suggests that you're cutting the baggage from the point of view.

36:42.933 --> 36:43.074
Right.

36:43.094 --> 36:44.275
You know, you even became your resource.

36:44.295 --> 36:44.476
Right.

36:44.516 --> 36:45.637
Maybe I'm misreading it.

36:45.657 --> 36:46.238
Well, you know,

36:46.403 --> 36:50.549
It shouldn't happen that way, but it often does.

36:50.569 --> 36:55.076
A lot of people would pretend that a scholarship leads you to a position.

36:55.156 --> 37:02.007
You may start with a point of view, to be sure, but you also allow the research to take you where it goes.

37:02.067 --> 37:05.372
People would say the same thing about any scientific hypothesis.

37:05.392 --> 37:09.258
You go into an experiment trying to prove something.

37:09.378 --> 37:11.301
That's right.

37:11.502 --> 37:15.027
If you're working towards an already predetermined conclusion,

37:15.007 --> 37:21.921
I think it would have to, in a way, unless it took its own contradictions.

37:21.941 --> 37:27.512
So what's the consensus of the editorial?

37:27.853 --> 37:34.787
We actually passed on one of them and took another one that was less egregious.

37:34.767 --> 37:36.609
But I mean, is it a discussion?

37:36.709 --> 37:37.130
Oh, yeah.

37:37.150 --> 37:38.812
Would people have points of view on it?

37:39.273 --> 37:39.493
Definitely.

37:39.513 --> 37:47.904
We're very mindful of it, and we try to stay away from the first kind that you described, which is scholarship with... The nose of a scholar.

37:48.044 --> 37:49.866
Yes, led by the nose.

37:50.387 --> 37:56.995
Or, you know, scholarship, you know, knows something out.

37:56.975 --> 38:04.006
I mean, for me, the big kick is I don't know if it really were an old deal, but the excitement is in discovery.

38:04.026 --> 38:06.629
That's an interesting way of looking at it, too.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.454
I was thinking a lot about this as far as electronic publishing.

38:09.474 --> 38:11.317
I'm doing research online.

38:11.617 --> 38:15.823
I feel like I'm in a video game where I'm distracting meteors.

38:16.164 --> 38:17.486
I'm a hundred things away.

38:17.546 --> 38:20.991
Things are just coming at me too fast and irrelevantly, and I don't want to.

38:20.971 --> 38:27.762
When I'm walking down an aisle in a library, the light is not getting to where I want to get.

38:27.842 --> 38:30.166
It's almost as if I want the distraction.

38:30.306 --> 38:31.468
Please surprise me.

38:31.488 --> 38:33.731
I've said it any number of times.

38:33.771 --> 38:37.377
The joy of browsing in a library or a secondhand bookstore

38:37.357 --> 38:43.993
It's not the book you go in to find.

38:44.013 --> 38:46.880
It's the book you never knew of.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.725
It didn't even exist until the moment you discovered it.

38:48.745 --> 38:49.867
But you say, wow, you know, I have this book.

38:49.887 --> 38:50.248
It's fascinating.

38:50.268 --> 38:52.073
And that happens all the time in the library.

38:52.093 --> 38:52.193
Yeah.

38:52.443 --> 38:53.385
And it's the best thing.

38:53.425 --> 38:54.026
It's exciting.

38:54.166 --> 38:54.687
It's thrilling.

38:54.707 --> 38:55.628
Yeah.

38:56.029 --> 39:03.300
Often I'll just note the first number in a catalog and just go to the general area.

39:03.861 --> 39:05.925
Have you ever read of the London Library in St.

39:05.945 --> 39:06.185
James?

39:06.205 --> 39:07.187
Oh, it's wonderful.

39:07.387 --> 39:07.848
Wonderful.

39:07.968 --> 39:10.732
Where they say it's associated browsing.

39:10.752 --> 39:12.335
I mean, what a great answer.

39:12.555 --> 39:14.198
Really, my book's at home.

39:14.178 --> 39:16.682
Really, one thing leads to another.

39:16.702 --> 39:22.772
I don't know what your schedule is, but I don't want to... How much more?

39:22.852 --> 39:28.721
We'll meet together, if you like, but... I think that... Do you know what the new math books were published in the 60s?

39:28.822 --> 39:28.882
No.

39:28.902 --> 39:29.262
What is this?

39:29.322 --> 39:29.943
What is this?

39:30.324 --> 39:37.696
You see, Larry, the cash cow, apparently, the cash cow, in recent years, apparently, has been the artworks, right?

39:37.716 --> 39:38.597
Now, changing them.

39:38.898 --> 39:39.038
But...

39:39.018 --> 39:53.802
Back in the 50s or the 60s, there was a book of books that Yale was allowed to publish and generated tremendously.

39:54.123 --> 39:54.884
It was subsidized by the book.

39:54.904 --> 39:55.625
It was all in the new math.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.069
She said, well, this is our new math.

39:58.089 --> 40:00.012
She kept calling it the new math money, the new math book.

40:00.032 --> 40:00.453
How great is that?

40:00.473 --> 40:02.717
So that really wasn't the title, but it was all about the new math.

40:02.737 --> 40:03.538
And you don't know anything about it.

40:03.558 --> 40:04.179
I don't know anything about it.

40:04.199 --> 40:04.840
I can't wait to read your book.

40:04.820 --> 40:16.673
What would you like to see most in a kind of celebratory history?

40:17.614 --> 40:32.110
I think that there is a, I mean, I think, you know, these, much like any life, I suppose, or any individual life, they're, you know, like a scholar led by the nose,

40:32.410 --> 40:40.503
You often think you're abiding by certain principles and guided by certain lights.

40:40.583 --> 40:46.392
It turns out often that there are very different things at work that bring you to where you are.

40:46.412 --> 40:50.038
I'd love to know if there's a healthy balance between those two things.

40:50.058 --> 40:52.822
There's a healthy balance between those two things.

40:53.123 --> 40:57.169
We're very principled and we're very deliberate and we're very forward-looking.

40:57.149 --> 41:01.920
But what are the surprises that Jabez, you know, and have Jabez and got us here?

41:02.181 --> 41:04.968
That's something that I would like to know more.

41:05.048 --> 41:09.218
And I've learned a lot already just from your session notes.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.050
I'm on the right track here?

41:11.070 --> 41:11.952
I do think you are, yeah.

41:12.272 --> 41:16.278
It sounds like I'm exploring some interesting things.

41:16.478 --> 41:17.259
Yeah, absolutely.

41:17.319 --> 41:19.503
Like I said, I can't wait to read this.

41:19.803 --> 41:21.165
I've learned a lot.

41:21.405 --> 41:22.908
I'm learning a lot from just at lunch.

41:23.108 --> 41:25.471
Well, the new math books, we'll have to know.

41:25.531 --> 41:29.337
Do you have any figures on standing orders from libraries?

41:29.357 --> 41:32.742
It's hard to tell right now because most of it is done for jobbers.

41:32.722 --> 41:34.745
and wholesalers.

41:35.105 --> 41:38.450
Many of them don't order direct sales.

41:38.490 --> 41:41.935
People over here in this conversation think I'm asking the most word.

41:42.095 --> 41:44.338
It's very important in how the culture works.

41:44.398 --> 41:52.249
There was a time not so long ago when you published a book and you would know instantly that it's going to have a guaranteed sale of

41:52.229 --> 41:54.071
two or three, four thousand years?

41:54.151 --> 41:56.693
Yeah, oh no, that's gone.

41:56.713 --> 41:56.973
That's gone.

41:56.993 --> 42:09.244
And that's why the crisis in university press publishing is happening, because those monographs used to be published and bought by university admissions libraries.

42:09.264 --> 42:12.007
It's no longer the case, and they'll tell you that.

42:12.027 --> 42:21.375
I mean, I was on a, I had lunch yesterday with a comic book professor, and she was shattered by my comment, you know, where I was on a panel, I think she'd done it all the time,

42:21.608 --> 42:37.691
And they asked a librarian, a big city system librarian head, if I give you X dollars to support modern graphism and humanities in the next five years, how would you greet that?

42:37.711 --> 42:46.023
And she said, I get on my knees and ask you to let me change how to spend this money.

42:46.784 --> 42:51.531
And I'd want to invest in computers, and I'd want to invest in people.

42:51.697 --> 42:56.303
I think it's largely true.

42:56.604 --> 43:09.821
I'd like to see our backlist get better and we're taking strides to make that happen.

43:10.101 --> 43:19.594
I think because of the, first of all, the kind of glamour of our

43:19.574 --> 43:21.357
frontless trade.

43:21.577 --> 43:23.280
Whenever you're ready.

43:23.801 --> 43:24.102
Thank you.

43:24.122 --> 43:32.116
The glamour of our frontless trade business and our art history list makes it so that, you know, the frontless always sticks along a little bit better.

43:32.216 --> 43:35.862
But we're making a lot of progress in building core documents.

43:35.842 --> 43:39.166
What percentage of your sales do you think?

43:39.186 --> 43:40.307
I'll get that from John.

43:40.407 --> 43:42.470
Yeah, John can give it to you.

43:42.490 --> 43:46.795
I think the last thing that I heard was about a 54% or something.

43:46.815 --> 43:47.555
Well, not really.

43:47.676 --> 43:49.438
Well, maybe a 54% or 46% back.

43:49.758 --> 43:54.624
But, you know, some prices are 60, 40, 70, 30, you know.

43:54.644 --> 43:57.647
But when do you decide to put those out of print?

43:57.667 --> 43:57.907
Right.

43:57.927 --> 43:58.508
You know,

43:58.488 --> 44:02.435
And there's a time when nothing will ever have to go out of print because of print-on-demand.

44:02.455 --> 44:08.726
We're actually bringing things back into print because of POD and things like that.

44:08.746 --> 44:11.170
A lot of authors aren't happy about that.

44:11.210 --> 44:14.756
Well, the choice is, of course, out of print.

44:15.016 --> 44:15.457
Out of print.

44:15.477 --> 44:15.838
Out of print.

44:15.858 --> 44:21.427
And if somebody would tell me I could get the rights of General Madness by my ticket in a minute, it would be something.

44:21.447 --> 44:23.010
It's not like the jargon.

44:22.990 --> 44:29.358
But they're not going to give that back, because it's up.

44:33.003 --> 44:35.085
So let's see.

44:35.106 --> 44:37.529
There's other stuff there.

44:37.709 --> 44:39.812
I guess a philosophical question.

44:39.832 --> 44:43.596
Do the potential sales of a proposal get you into your decision to publish it?

44:43.616 --> 44:45.779
Especially in the trade division, yes.

44:45.799 --> 44:47.521
In the academic division, no.

44:47.882 --> 44:49.804
And that's pretty straightforward.

44:49.824 --> 44:50.365
It's a trade book.

44:50.682 --> 45:04.121
The only reason to publish it is because it's a contribution and the course is over.

45:04.141 --> 45:07.465
Yeah, the course is over.

45:07.485 --> 45:08.967
And the academic division, we don't look at that.

45:08.987 --> 45:11.130
We've discussed that in other areas of the House.

45:11.150 --> 45:12.673
So I would say we've covered a pretty good area here.

45:12.693 --> 45:12.753
OK.

45:12.773 --> 45:14.655
And if you don't know about the right amount of money, I've got to find it.

45:14.675 --> 45:14.775
Yeah.

45:14.796 --> 45:16.598
Let's do it that up.

45:16.618 --> 45:16.999
I'd love to see it.

45:17.019 --> 45:17.639
Let me talk about dissertation.

45:17.659 --> 45:17.860
All right.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.040
Perfect.
