WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:04.180
Now, what were you just saying, Dan?

00:04.521 --> 00:08.345
We're talking about Dan and Priscilla, and it's April 4th.

00:08.365 --> 00:08.885
You have to do this.

00:09.126 --> 00:16.814
What I was saying was that it was my view that there are three types of collectors with regard to the public eye.

00:17.395 --> 00:23.922
There are some collectors, and they can all be great collectors, who choose to remain anonymous no matter what.

00:24.182 --> 00:25.464
And would you cite some examples?

00:25.484 --> 00:26.465
They might let people see that.

00:26.885 --> 00:27.446
For instance.

00:27.566 --> 00:29.568
Well, I can't because they choose to remain anonymous.

00:29.588 --> 00:30.930
But you must know who's similar to mine.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.772
But let's use the example you used.

00:33.629 --> 00:35.592
is the person who collects magic.

00:35.992 --> 00:36.573
It's good.

00:36.593 --> 00:38.055
Okay?

00:38.175 --> 00:38.976
I couldn't, I couldn't.

00:39.116 --> 00:41.699
Do you know how many depositions I've sat in?

00:41.720 --> 00:42.180
No, you're good.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.163
I just want to tell you.

00:44.243 --> 00:52.854
That's... Then there are some collectors who crave publicity.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.156
Malcolm Forbes.

00:54.536 --> 00:59.483
Malcolm Forbes is the art type of a collector who is a great collector.

01:00.063 --> 01:01.485
Great collector.

01:01.505 --> 01:02.927
But every time he buys...

01:03.262 --> 01:07.006
First of all, he bought 99% of the time only at auction.

01:07.386 --> 01:12.752
If you had a great Easter egg and you wanted to sell it to him privately, he wouldn't buy it.

01:13.193 --> 01:16.617
If you put it up at auction, he would bid higher than anybody else.

01:16.717 --> 01:17.498
Absolutely.

01:17.518 --> 01:21.582
He told me that same great statement.

01:21.602 --> 01:25.787
He didn't use the Easter egg example, but he said, if you offer him something privately, he'll say no.

01:26.247 --> 01:27.448
He'll go twice at auction.

01:27.589 --> 01:31.733
I'll give you a concrete example, and that was John Fleming offered...

01:32.118 --> 01:43.929
Malcolm Forbes, an item in 1976, which was by Centennial Catalog, and that was George Washington's biographical fragment.

01:43.949 --> 01:59.003
And he offered it to him for a price that was considerably less than what it realized when it came up at auction in 1988, when George's date sold it, and Malcolm Forbes bought it.

02:00.232 --> 02:01.133
From John's estate?

02:01.153 --> 02:03.817
From John's estate, at auction, against me.

02:04.278 --> 02:09.146
I was bidding, I was the end of dinner on it.

02:09.166 --> 02:23.267
And one of the Ford's sons bought it, for the Ford's collection, at a price that was... And John told me that he had offered it to Malcolm Ford, and Malcolm Ford returned to that.

02:23.307 --> 02:28.635
But the third kind of collector is... The third kind of collector is the person who

02:29.898 --> 02:32.082
He's not looking for great publicity.

02:32.763 --> 02:34.867
He's not a hermit.

02:34.887 --> 02:36.911
He's just interested in collecting.

02:37.612 --> 02:41.679
If somebody comes to him or wants to see his collection... Somebody like me.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.583
Like you, or other people.

02:44.204 --> 02:45.206
There's a good example.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.632
A real good example is this guy, John...

02:49.034 --> 02:51.317
Oh, John Marion.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.720
John Marion.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.601
He's a great example.

02:54.621 --> 02:56.123
Actually, you should talk to him.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.026
That's a major collection.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.668
I can't believe I haven't thought of that.

02:59.688 --> 03:01.430
This guy is a fabulous collection.

03:01.450 --> 03:03.213
This guy's name is John Marion.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.194
Marion Webster.

03:04.595 --> 03:07.038
Same family, I would bet.

03:07.058 --> 03:09.221
Yes, we learned about it the same family.

03:09.241 --> 03:11.944
Well, this guy has a great collection of what?

03:12.064 --> 03:18.653
Of fantasy, illustrated books, and original art.

03:18.970 --> 03:25.438
Heavy on Aubrey Beardsley, heavy on Goodstock DorÃ©, William Russell Flint.

03:25.458 --> 03:28.842
I haven't seen his collection in maybe seven or eight years.

03:28.862 --> 03:30.604
I imagine all the Rackhams, all the Dulac's.

03:30.624 --> 03:33.708
But Rackham and Dulac, everything in... Original art, generally.

03:33.728 --> 03:35.611
I believe he's in his late 80s.

03:36.251 --> 03:37.693
He is a charming man.

03:37.713 --> 03:39.896
Is he still collecting on that?

03:39.916 --> 03:42.339
The very odd thing, but mostly no.

03:42.819 --> 03:46.564
He has a townhouse on the...

03:46.831 --> 03:51.135
on Star Drive, one of those houses at the end of, on the flat of a hill there.

03:51.615 --> 03:55.859
It's not West Hill Place, it's straight next to West Hill Place.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.622
What would make him an interesting subject?

03:58.942 --> 04:04.688
He started collecting when he was about 18 or 19 at Harvard, when I got a student at Harvard, and collected over the years.

04:05.108 --> 04:11.915
When you see his house, he has filled it with books and original art for the books, from the basement to the theater.

04:11.935 --> 04:14.577
It's a top to bottom collection, what I call a top to bottom collection.

04:15.029 --> 04:18.052
He's very accessible.

04:18.753 --> 04:22.137
I can write a letter for you.

04:22.497 --> 04:24.319
I was with Ken Rendell last week.

04:24.339 --> 04:25.060
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.302
What a sweet guy.

04:27.443 --> 04:34.911
He mentioned a guy in New York or wherever, and he said Priscilla won't know.

04:34.931 --> 04:36.753
Was his name Koch or something like that?

04:36.773 --> 04:37.034
Fred Koch.

04:37.214 --> 04:38.355
I told her about that.

04:38.375 --> 04:38.936
Did you mention him?

04:38.956 --> 04:39.957
Yes, I mentioned him.

04:40.578 --> 04:44.364
He said, this guy is really a strange guy.

04:44.404 --> 04:45.506
He's inaccessible.

04:45.526 --> 04:47.910
And that's what Ken suggested.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.594
That's the other kind.

04:50.674 --> 05:01.171
That's the kind of person who really, at this stage of his life, anyhow, has the greatest stuff, but he just doesn't want anybody to... Well, he said he did a lot of homoerotic stuff.

05:01.531 --> 05:06.960
Well, I don't know about that, because I've never... Yeah, I'm sure, but I've never told him.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.841
Innocent me.

05:07.861 --> 05:08.442
Naive me.

05:08.607 --> 05:10.570
Why would he go like that, you know?

05:10.950 --> 05:19.241
Nick, I have to say that that is as much rumor as it is fact.

05:19.942 --> 05:20.623
Not that I care.

05:20.883 --> 05:22.826
Personally, I really don't.

05:23.106 --> 05:25.049
I'm really interested in what you collect.

05:25.109 --> 05:31.037
He has a great collection of Jean Cocteau, a great collection, and he has collected Cocteau

05:31.962 --> 05:40.010
for about eight or nine years now, and his main competition has been the Severin Wunderman, who has a museum in California.

05:40.070 --> 05:53.723
Now, when you're out in California, you should see Wunderman or his curator, because this is a museum devoted entirely to the work of one man, Jean Cocteau, and it's the Severin Wunderman Museum of Jean Cocteau, and I have the address.

05:54.004 --> 05:55.885
Hold on, let me get the address for you a little bit.

05:55.905 --> 05:57.046
Is it in the Southern Calico?

05:57.647 --> 06:00.670
Yes, it's in Southern Calico.

06:01.696 --> 06:09.767
But he's a good example of this very private collector.

06:09.787 --> 06:14.332
And in his case, the economic circumstances are huge.

06:14.352 --> 06:18.938
The guy is worth in excess of $400 million.

06:19.559 --> 06:25.527
In the case of Mariam, while he's not poor,

06:25.861 --> 06:29.065
The economic circumstance is cut across the strata.

06:29.085 --> 06:36.214
You can have the poorest person, and you can have the wealthiest person, but the collecting falls into these three areas.

06:37.155 --> 06:39.538
Based on their experience.

06:39.719 --> 06:41.841
Based on my experience, there are these three types.

06:42.522 --> 06:53.156
And it's important for the collector to know that, because we're always looking to improve our collection, which means if we go to other collectors, I have bought three major collections in my life.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.339
Unblocked, as they say.

06:55.359 --> 06:55.699
Unblocked.

06:56.725 --> 07:04.151
And what I have got is the essence of those three major collections and, in addition, things that I have bought singly.

07:06.053 --> 07:13.419
And I've gotten rid of, or in another location, 99% of the material that I ever bought.

07:16.442 --> 07:24.329
So, for instance, what you see here on these three areas are some of the greatest things in my collecting field.

07:24.349 --> 07:25.990
There isn't anybody that has things

07:26.577 --> 07:30.081
that are any better, by and large, in terms of the printed book.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.604
I was just going to say, you went to manuscript stuff, and you just entered.

07:32.624 --> 07:33.104
Very little.

07:33.505 --> 07:34.526
I'm only into letters.

07:36.228 --> 07:44.217
So, if it's manuscript material, that is letters, because I'm interested in the person, Arthur Conan Doyle.

07:44.237 --> 07:49.122
I'm not necessarily interested in having Arthur Conan Doyle's manuscript of Sherlock Holmes.

07:49.142 --> 07:50.203
I'm interested in the books.

07:50.584 --> 07:53.887
Well, that phrase, the creative process.

07:54.048 --> 07:54.668
Right.

07:54.768 --> 07:56.230
That's his letters.

07:56.530 --> 08:00.757
Not necessarily, unless he talks about the war.

08:00.937 --> 08:01.758
Well, yeah.

08:01.798 --> 08:03.962
He's writing about his trip to... Right.

08:03.982 --> 08:10.793
But in Doyle's case, for instance, his trips, he was the first major lecturer from England on the U.S.

08:10.813 --> 08:11.134
circuit.

08:11.735 --> 08:15.781
So when this guy Pond, Major Pond, was a very famous impresario.

08:15.801 --> 08:23.854
I have all of Doyle's letters to Major Pond in 1902 and 1903, but he was touring the United States, from New York to California,

08:24.391 --> 08:26.838
stopping at hotels in Chicago and Oshkosh.

08:27.219 --> 08:28.241
Now, where do you get these, Dan?

08:28.261 --> 08:30.447
Do you get these at auction or from other collections?

08:30.567 --> 08:32.352
At auction, on block, from other collectors.

08:33.555 --> 08:40.915
One of the last things we said in New York, I said, going back even to your early days,

08:43.207 --> 08:45.709
Have you ever bought things on time?

08:45.749 --> 08:50.113
Have you ever bought things on time that economically... I mean, that are really... I still do it.

08:50.133 --> 08:50.854
You shouldn't do it.

08:50.874 --> 08:53.496
I mean, this is an insane thing for me to be doing.

08:53.516 --> 08:53.936
I still do it.

08:54.097 --> 08:54.977
For me to be doing.

08:55.518 --> 08:59.241
The great collector always does it.

08:59.261 --> 09:02.104
The great Coke is worth $400 million.

09:02.344 --> 09:03.505
$400 million.

09:03.525 --> 09:04.145
And he does it.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.487
What's the source of his fortune, by the way?

09:06.507 --> 09:10.751
Coke Industries... I've seen it on heavy equipment.

09:10.771 --> 09:12.893
But Coke Industries...

09:13.345 --> 09:19.834
There are four living brothers that were essentially left the business by their father.

09:19.854 --> 09:24.261
And there was a great legal battle, and two of the brothers split out from the other two.

09:24.601 --> 09:26.664
You can tell the story about Koch Industries.

09:26.704 --> 09:27.605
It's a public story.

09:28.106 --> 09:29.268
I don't want to be quoted on it.

09:29.288 --> 09:30.490
No, but you can tell the story.

09:31.952 --> 09:35.657
So Nick, it's public.

09:35.997 --> 09:37.079
I'll tell you all about those.

09:38.201 --> 09:39.943
Wait a minute, let me get this.

09:40.295 --> 09:43.498
Oh, Thorn is in... Thorn, it works for Max Reed in London.

09:45.240 --> 09:45.700
Really?

09:50.325 --> 09:55.030
Thorn is the woman who went out with Michael, is that right?

09:56.171 --> 10:03.298
She was a debutante who came out and was in school a year after Michael.

10:03.438 --> 10:08.884
I don't know if they went out with each other, like on a date or something like that, but she knew Michael.

10:09.657 --> 10:14.063
She'd be worth, like, giving a ring to her.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.967
She was there?

10:17.047 --> 10:21.634
She was probably here for the Bradley Martin.

10:21.794 --> 10:26.881
All these people are, sort of, Priscilla has developed this amazing circle.

10:26.901 --> 10:31.227
I have to say, this is not to lose her, and I don't want to say it in front of her, but I am poor.

10:31.662 --> 10:36.188
but what she has accomplished as a book dealer in six or seven years.

10:36.208 --> 10:36.769
It's amazing.

10:36.789 --> 10:39.112
I mean, she is at the top of her profession.

10:39.132 --> 10:41.435
Well, I think there's nobody better in this field.

10:42.997 --> 10:46.621
I have been, what, going all over talking to everybody.

10:46.762 --> 10:47.503
Her name comes up.

10:47.663 --> 10:47.763
Yeah.

10:48.364 --> 10:50.767
Anything to do with, and you forgot to use the illustrator.

10:50.787 --> 10:51.828
Time after time after time.

10:51.848 --> 10:54.051
I mean, she was the one who made the market.

10:54.071 --> 10:59.458
She found Frank as a customer and completely overlooked her by everybody.

11:00.299 --> 11:05.065
sold her first catalog on block for a million dollars?

11:05.085 --> 11:05.246
We did.

11:05.266 --> 11:05.486
Sure.

11:06.167 --> 11:09.171
We shipped her first red catalog.

11:09.191 --> 11:10.813
I mean, we don't say anything about it.

11:10.833 --> 11:14.338
I told you the price, but I'm telling you.

11:14.358 --> 11:17.362
On block.

11:17.382 --> 11:18.023
Oh, for a million dollars.

11:18.043 --> 11:20.025
Have you seen that red catalog?

11:20.046 --> 11:20.106
No.

11:20.126 --> 11:23.771
I'm going to ask her about her catalogs.

11:23.791 --> 11:24.912
She really doesn't issue them.

11:24.932 --> 11:26.074
They don't get around, do they?

11:26.474 --> 11:29.258
Once she's issued four or five catalogs, that's all.

11:29.278 --> 11:29.378
Yeah.

11:30.202 --> 11:33.125
And the ones, I believe with Artiste, are all reference books.

11:34.186 --> 11:36.428
I mean, they were sold out as reference books.

11:36.448 --> 11:38.730
Do you think I should call this gal up when I get to London?

11:38.750 --> 11:39.851
I don't think we'll make it.

11:39.871 --> 11:40.051
Yeah.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.372
Yeah, she's at Simmons Reed.

11:41.592 --> 11:43.574
But I mean, don't call her now before I get there.

11:43.594 --> 11:44.134
Maybe call her.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.197
I think it'd be better if we call her in London.

11:47.217 --> 11:47.958
I think so, yeah.

11:48.258 --> 11:50.560
Because then you might want to stop by and have a drink.

11:50.580 --> 11:51.301
I think so, yeah.

11:51.321 --> 11:53.923
Because this way they have time to think about it.

11:53.943 --> 11:54.103
Exactly.

11:54.123 --> 11:56.265
And I don't want to give her time to think about this.

11:57.126 --> 11:58.487
I want these all back again.

11:59.851 --> 12:01.232
I'm a good guy.

12:01.252 --> 12:03.314
This is Priscilla's great reference library.

12:03.334 --> 12:04.956
This is my reference library.

12:04.976 --> 12:06.177
Can I take all these with you?

12:06.197 --> 12:06.838
Sure you will.

12:06.858 --> 12:08.860
Are you going to let me do this?

12:08.880 --> 12:09.000
Yes.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.501
Can I put them in my Xerox machine?

12:10.521 --> 12:11.602
Yes.

12:11.622 --> 12:15.266
And then return it back to me, okay?

12:15.286 --> 12:15.406
ASAP.

12:15.466 --> 12:17.648
Priscilla is the most assiduous person.

12:18.489 --> 12:22.993
I was just asking Priscilla, after Houghton died yesterday, is that right?

12:23.154 --> 12:25.116
Or within the last couple of days?

12:25.156 --> 12:26.317
Yes, she's a bit.

12:26.457 --> 12:29.740
And the whole...

12:30.496 --> 12:36.623
The burning question for me, and I think this was a burning question for Roger Stott, by the way.

12:37.264 --> 12:38.345
I don't doubt it.

12:38.365 --> 12:42.871
And I'll get back to that later, because Roger works very in the Socratic method.

12:42.911 --> 12:46.695
He doesn't really tell you what he thinks you should be doing, but he suggests.

12:46.735 --> 12:58.769
Anyway, he said, what interests him, and this is what Roger said, what interests me even more than why some people collect is why some great collectors start collecting.

12:58.789 --> 13:00.351
I'd love to know the answer to that.

13:00.803 --> 13:02.948
He said, and I said, who do you mean?

13:03.028 --> 13:03.890
Of course, I should be.

13:03.930 --> 13:08.038
Here I am in the whole library, and I should say, well, of course.

13:08.339 --> 13:14.492
And I did, but I did ask him, and there was this Harrison

13:17.088 --> 13:18.289
with photography.

13:18.309 --> 13:24.898
They mentioned a major Shakespeare collector out of Columbus who never mentioned Arthur Houghton, who would have been the principal example.

13:24.918 --> 13:28.882
Well, I'll tell you the reason he never mentioned Arthur Houghton.

13:29.023 --> 13:32.927
Well, I'll tell you what the burning question is.

13:33.528 --> 13:37.473
The burning question is, what has Arthur Houghton left?

13:37.493 --> 13:38.735
Well, we'll find that out.

13:39.095 --> 13:42.139
We'll find that out in time for me to get it into my book, too, won't we?

13:42.159 --> 13:43.180
You may or you may not.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.590
Well, if they probate the will, I can say I will.

13:45.730 --> 13:47.753
But New Jersey's not that far away.

13:49.456 --> 13:55.405
I think the will will probably be probated at wide plantation.

13:55.425 --> 13:56.326
I mean, it's a short amount.

13:56.346 --> 13:56.606
Probably not.

13:56.626 --> 13:58.569
The will that is probated is public record.

13:58.669 --> 13:58.910
Yes.

13:59.350 --> 13:59.591
Right.

14:00.011 --> 14:02.335
But not everything is in the will.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.258
I'll give you an example right now.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.843
A very good friend of mine died.

14:08.404 --> 14:09.986
He was a trustee of a college.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.251
And he left a million-dollar fund

14:14.058 --> 14:23.931
to be distributed to reasonable individuals or organizations that had an interest that he shared.

14:24.912 --> 14:27.435
That's just the way the will was written.

14:27.455 --> 14:30.660
And he left it under the stewardship of a particular judge.

14:32.903 --> 14:35.286
The million dollars was gone overnight.

14:37.468 --> 14:40.993
In one day's time, the million dollars was gone and distributed.

14:41.615 --> 14:42.816
There were no proposals.

14:42.876 --> 14:45.940
This was to be him like a foundation, as I know.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.042
I was with the guy before he died.

14:48.062 --> 14:50.965
There were no proposals submitted.

14:51.526 --> 14:53.088
Nobody had a chance.

14:53.408 --> 14:58.513
How the million dollars was distributed is a very private matter.

14:58.533 --> 15:01.697
And as long as no laws were broken, you will never know.

15:02.798 --> 15:05.061
But again, this remains to be seen.

15:05.161 --> 15:05.341
Right.

15:05.401 --> 15:08.644
But do you think Arthur would be that private?

15:08.664 --> 15:10.086
I think he will be in some things.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.618
Have you met him, Priscilla?

15:12.638 --> 15:13.339
I met him.

15:14.060 --> 15:15.081
Yes, I met him.

15:15.101 --> 15:27.196
Leonard's asking him that this is just, you know, he said, I was at the Houghton sale, and he said, I saw him in the back, counting the money, scratching his palms with anticipation.

15:27.216 --> 15:28.158
Tell him what John said.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.781
I mean, that's just, no, I've got that on tape.

15:30.801 --> 15:32.623
I mean, Leonard said that.

15:32.643 --> 15:35.186
Is that an unfair observation on Leonard's part?

15:37.109 --> 15:40.613
On the other hand, John Fleming told me that he,

15:42.230 --> 15:49.941
a number of times to various people that Arthur Houghton made more money as book collector, as a collector, than any dealer ever did.

15:49.961 --> 15:52.585
He didn't need it, because we're talking Corning Glassman.

15:52.605 --> 15:52.725
No.

15:53.526 --> 15:55.088
It was a kid, the excitement.

15:55.108 --> 15:56.190
But also, he didn't.

15:56.210 --> 15:57.451
We bought one manuscript.

15:57.892 --> 15:59.014
He bought the Houghton.

15:59.034 --> 16:00.235
That's all he needed to buy.

16:00.295 --> 16:05.683
If you never bought another thing in your whole life, he wanted another story of it.

16:06.544 --> 16:10.650
And he broke it up.

16:11.963 --> 16:15.628
And Betcher still owned at the time of his death, a goodly portion of it.

16:15.929 --> 16:20.775
Didn't he even break that up to prove to the insurance company or something that it was worth what he was saying?

16:21.016 --> 16:21.516
Exactly.

16:21.536 --> 16:22.558
Which is a great story.

16:22.938 --> 16:23.639
Exactly.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.502
And no one would believe nothing of the insurance company.

16:25.522 --> 16:26.804
But they just did a couple of them.

16:26.824 --> 16:28.266
They said, all right, all right.

16:28.286 --> 16:33.473
See, when I was at Harvard, Arthur Houghton was a member of many of the visiting crews of all the libraries.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.679
So I would meet with him, you know, once a year, probably.

16:37.719 --> 16:39.642
We're talking about when now?

16:40.077 --> 16:44.941
Well, this is about 15, 20 years ago.

16:44.961 --> 16:48.344
He would still have been quite involved.

16:48.404 --> 16:50.206
He's very active still.

16:50.346 --> 16:51.106
Very active.

16:52.087 --> 16:53.108
What did John say?

16:53.128 --> 16:58.472
John said he stopped collecting because he wanted to be the executor of the estate.

16:58.492 --> 17:09.882
That is, he wanted to dispose of his estate while he was still alive, rather than take a chance as to what was going to happen to him.

17:10.317 --> 17:18.808
He wanted the auction catalogs of the Arcahoughton collection to stand as memorials in his collecting abilities.

17:18.868 --> 17:20.411
And he wanted to see them while he was alive.

17:20.511 --> 17:22.053
And he wanted to see them while he was alive.

17:22.694 --> 17:23.895
And a lot of people do that.

17:23.915 --> 17:26.058
Evidently, more and more.

17:26.098 --> 17:30.704
We're seeing it happen with, I mean, look at Harrison Horowitz, the same thing.

17:31.746 --> 17:39.396
Those auction catalogs really are quite important to anyone who's collecting the knowledge.

17:41.097 --> 17:46.524
I mean, really.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.207
It was quite a hell of a collection, though.

17:50.008 --> 17:54.333
Did you say that, this was earlier, that Hayden bought some of Houghton's stuff?

17:54.353 --> 17:57.757
No, he bought major things from the Houghton.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.638
Is that right?

17:58.738 --> 17:59.159
Absolutely.

18:00.340 --> 18:05.907
When John went to London for the first Houghton sale,

18:06.815 --> 18:13.442
He was representing, among other people, Haven O'Moore, and the majority of John Fine was for Haven O'Moore at the first and second whole sale.

18:14.643 --> 18:26.276
And to the best of my knowledge, that was the first time that Haven really emerged on the scene as a major collector.

18:26.336 --> 18:27.557
So that was in 79.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.099
It was in 79, and then he was in 80.

18:29.139 --> 18:30.080
The timing is perfect.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.361
That's when they get the money.

18:31.901 --> 18:34.324
That's when we get the money.

18:34.912 --> 18:36.834
That's when they became, that's when we became.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.777
I was already out of Congress for three years.

18:40.759 --> 18:46.226
Did anyone ever, did anyone ever realize that he was the one that had somebody else?

18:46.246 --> 18:48.248
Never in a million years.

18:48.268 --> 19:04.328
I was working at John's place in 1980, in 1979, when the first half of the Houghton sale occurred.

19:04.595 --> 19:08.378
I met Hayden O'Moore for the first time then, but I met him in London?

19:08.419 --> 19:15.245
No, in New York at John's, but I met him as an employee at John's, so Hayden didn't take much notice of him.

19:15.265 --> 19:34.062
The following year, I was in business myself in Boston, and John had came up to Boston several times in 80, 81, 82, for some things of receptions or whatever at the Houghton Library.

19:34.413 --> 19:38.380
We were with him at one classic reception, remember?

19:38.400 --> 19:47.275
And at one of them, one of the receptions, we were with Haven and his wife, and we went out afterwards.

19:47.295 --> 19:49.319
The one with Hans Krauss.

19:49.339 --> 19:50.160
What H.P.

19:50.180 --> 19:50.380
was there?

19:50.400 --> 19:51.102
Right.

19:51.162 --> 19:52.544
Remember what his comment was?

19:52.845 --> 19:53.946
He had to speak German.

19:53.967 --> 19:54.527
Right.

19:54.548 --> 19:56.010
Exactly.

19:56.331 --> 19:57.272
That's the class.

19:57.312 --> 19:58.935
The Goethe exhibition.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.281
Garfield Houghton.

20:02.521 --> 20:04.783
Garfield Houghton, and H.P.

20:05.244 --> 20:14.953
was there, who actually, despite what everyone else said, I always found him to be a very charming man.

20:15.134 --> 20:16.955
No, I didn't find him.

20:17.036 --> 20:19.878
No, but I found him to be a very charming man.

20:19.898 --> 20:26.425
Edward Wolfe paid him the great compliment, though, he said, in terms of knowledge, he said, Couch had it all over Rosenbach.

20:27.130 --> 20:28.912
Oh, I don't believe that's my knowledge.

20:29.033 --> 20:29.533
I've got it.

20:29.633 --> 20:30.755
I'm going to put it in my book.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.217
Holy cow.

20:32.417 --> 20:33.659
Donald Turnhoven is great.

20:34.940 --> 20:39.867
He said, but people didn't like Krauss, but they really liked Rosenbach.

20:39.887 --> 20:43.452
I mean, you could sit and smoke your cigar and drink your scotch with them.

20:43.692 --> 20:48.378
But he said, in terms of real bibliographical knowledge, he said, Krauss had it all over him.

20:49.099 --> 20:49.840
Edwin Wolff said that.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.963
It's absolutely on tape.

20:51.983 --> 20:53.425
It's a documentary statement.

20:53.928 --> 20:58.777
The first time Priscilla and I slept over there, right?

20:58.857 --> 21:00.881
It was wonderful.

21:01.382 --> 21:03.225
Nobody was there.

21:03.245 --> 21:05.890
John left us alone over the weekend.

21:06.050 --> 21:15.187
We were looking at all the books and everything.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.792
We went to sleep in one of his guest rooms.

21:18.430 --> 21:21.994
which were quite beautiful.

21:22.014 --> 21:28.500
Remember, it's all Rosenbach stuff, so if you knew, if you could get a sense of Rosenbach's taste.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.702
Oh, I've been to the Rosenbach house.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.304
His taste was incredible.

21:32.965 --> 21:39.892
So he left us there, and in the morning, the first thing I did was, and I was stark naked, I walk into the big room.

21:39.932 --> 21:40.693
This is embarrassing.

21:40.713 --> 21:44.436
I walk into the big room, and I sit down and play piano.

21:44.456 --> 21:48.100
And I said, this is the wish of mine that I want to play piano.

21:48.586 --> 21:51.371
And he bought a wonderful little piano.

21:51.411 --> 21:55.758
The reason he bought the piano was because he was best friends with Benny Goodman.

21:56.118 --> 21:57.060
Because of John Fleming.

21:57.080 --> 21:57.761
John Fleming.

21:57.781 --> 21:59.744
And Benny Goodman used to play there frequently.

21:59.805 --> 22:01.327
He'd rehearse his group there.

22:01.708 --> 22:09.160
And I had the pleasure, because of Priscilla, along with Priscilla's father, the two of us, had the pleasure of hearing

22:09.494 --> 22:13.980
Benny's last rehearsals shortly before he died, right at John Fleming.

22:14.000 --> 22:22.271
So anyhow, just to get over there and play the piano, playing Chopin and Mozart in Rosenbach's book room.

22:22.391 --> 22:24.314
It was so fun.

22:24.334 --> 22:25.375
It was great.

22:25.395 --> 22:27.458
Because I said, what are you doing?

22:27.478 --> 22:29.621
Why don't you get over there?

22:29.761 --> 22:32.444
What if someone comes in?

22:32.464 --> 22:34.527
You don't know who has keys to this place.

22:34.627 --> 22:37.752
And not only that, he left the place unlocked all the time.

22:37.972 --> 22:38.893
There was no alarm.

22:39.110 --> 22:39.891
No alarm.

22:40.031 --> 22:40.592
No alarm.

22:40.752 --> 22:41.173
And John?

22:41.353 --> 22:42.014
He just died.

22:42.074 --> 22:45.839
I mean, we're not talking about somebody back in the, yeah, we're not talking about the 50s.

22:46.220 --> 22:47.021
Right, he just died.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.843
And he was never hit.

22:49.524 --> 22:53.049
And I can't believe, I'll tell you, sometimes I think Priscilla feels the same way.

22:53.069 --> 22:54.391
I can't believe he's gone.

22:54.471 --> 22:56.354
I mean, I played golf with him.

22:56.514 --> 22:57.716
He taught me how to play golf.

22:58.376 --> 23:01.821
The first time I went out and played with him, I nearly ran him down with a golf cart.

23:01.841 --> 23:03.724
I mean, it was so funny.

23:03.744 --> 23:05.506
The stories are just endless.

23:05.526 --> 23:06.788
How did you meet John?

23:07.088 --> 23:09.010
A mutual friend.

23:09.511 --> 23:21.704
Actually, one of my father's friends, Jack Tainzer, who was at the time Senior Vice President of the Northern Gallery, who was a good friend of my father's and a friend of mine.

23:21.844 --> 23:24.166
I was working for a publishing house in New York.

23:24.186 --> 23:29.912
And I was telling Jack that I kind of wanted to leave the publishing world and go out into business for myself.

23:29.932 --> 23:31.354
And he said, well, you like books.

23:31.374 --> 23:34.277
I've got a friend you want to meet.

23:34.628 --> 23:35.369
At his place.

23:35.549 --> 23:36.931
I'll set it up.

23:37.812 --> 23:40.396
And then he called and said, yes, we're having lunch.

23:40.456 --> 23:41.778
Meet me at Fitzadris next week at 1 o'clock.

23:41.918 --> 23:43.140
And I met John.

23:43.540 --> 23:46.725
And we got along like a house of fire.

23:46.905 --> 23:47.906
And that was the beginning.

23:47.986 --> 23:49.569
I said, this is it.

23:49.609 --> 23:51.431
This is where I want to be.

23:51.652 --> 23:53.714
This is what I want to do.

23:53.855 --> 23:59.382
I mean, it just... 322.

23:59.402 --> 24:02.847
And we got on very well indeed in our relationship.

24:03.839 --> 24:08.585
Though I just never looked back.

24:08.685 --> 24:16.735
He was my best friend, my teacher, my mentor.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.238
Edwin wrote that book.

24:19.298 --> 24:24.505
He did not have access to all the Rosenbach files from that later period.

24:25.205 --> 24:27.668
Yeah, and he won't either.

24:27.688 --> 24:30.572
Well, anything that John kept himself.

24:30.940 --> 24:35.205
Is that right?

24:35.225 --> 24:37.447
And John had all the old cards.

24:39.189 --> 24:39.950
Hmm.

24:40.050 --> 24:42.172
Everything, every book on inventory.

24:42.232 --> 24:45.476
It was pretty much indicated to me that they've got the stuff out.

24:45.496 --> 24:49.961
Well, yeah, that may well be, but part of it John still has.

24:49.981 --> 24:54.266
Because he had all the inventory books, all the Rosenbach inventory books, since they were continued.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.930
In other words, when John bought the inventory, he bought the inventory books.

24:58.170 --> 24:59.091
That's right.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.774
Well, with John Fleming.

25:01.794 --> 25:03.136
And so they're at the Royal Club.

25:03.156 --> 25:09.783
On John's letterhead, he always said, John was a successor to Royal Club.

25:09.943 --> 25:13.688
No, formally associated with Royal Club.

25:13.988 --> 25:15.510
I've never seen a book dealer write that.

25:15.630 --> 25:16.731
By appointment to the Queen.

25:16.831 --> 25:19.955
Yeah, I've never seen any book dealer write that.

25:19.975 --> 25:26.502
And yet he was, at the top of his profession, the number one dealer in the world.

25:26.582 --> 25:26.923
You got it?

25:26.943 --> 25:27.904
Yeah, John Fleming was a plus.

25:27.924 --> 25:28.144
Absolutely.

25:28.164 --> 25:28.825
All by himself.

25:29.176 --> 25:31.918
I'm seeing Colin Franklin.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.581
He did a lot of stuff for Hayden.

25:35.482 --> 25:36.362
Not as much as John.

25:36.923 --> 25:40.546
But I was John's partner.

25:46.351 --> 25:58.862
The first time I met Hayden, he asked me to drop something off to him the next day.

25:59.365 --> 26:00.407
This was in Boston?

26:00.467 --> 26:01.508
Yeah, in Boston, Cambridge.

26:02.530 --> 26:04.893
Oh, the second time went up here, when we met him up here.

26:05.554 --> 26:15.449
And I went by, now the house in Oxford Square that he was supposed to live in.

26:15.469 --> 26:15.609
Right.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.956
I don't believe for a moment, I didn't believe for a moment that he would have lived there.

26:20.216 --> 26:20.577
Remember that?

26:20.617 --> 26:21.198
We were together.

26:21.258 --> 26:21.498
Right.

26:21.658 --> 26:22.560
I remember that day.

26:22.580 --> 26:28.849
And I had to go, and I had to drop something off to him, and it was the apartment next to the house.

26:29.133 --> 26:34.078
There's a brick apartment building, and... That's the apartment spot you're saying, right?

26:34.098 --> 26:39.242
Right, and that's where I dropped the book off, and he came, and he physically came out of that building to pick it up.

26:39.262 --> 26:40.083
Didn't let you in?

26:40.103 --> 26:41.645
No, absolutely not.

26:41.665 --> 26:44.467
You've heard the story about the guy who brought the shit, have you ever heard that story?

26:45.088 --> 26:48.831
Mr. Shaggy told me this story.

26:50.232 --> 26:55.197
What was the... And I've had it confirmed by somebody else, but he didn't know what books they were.

26:55.257 --> 26:58.380
A guy with an Armenian name who worked for Krauss, Kavak, Kavak.

26:58.630 --> 27:03.495
Yes, the Shakespeare first, I don't know who it is, but I know he bought them.

27:03.515 --> 27:05.397
When was this how long ago?

27:05.497 --> 27:07.559
Well, it's whenever he bought the Shakespeare's.

27:07.579 --> 27:08.360
Yeah, 83, 84.

27:08.460 --> 27:13.025
This guy brought them up from Krause, knocked on the door.

27:13.045 --> 27:15.067
Of course, they all wanted to know who this guy was.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.768
Everyone wanted to.

27:17.109 --> 27:21.874
And so he knocked, and he was delivering the package, and he asked if he could use the bathroom.

27:21.894 --> 27:24.817
And Haven said there's a gas station around the corner.

27:24.837 --> 27:26.518
Wouldn't let him in the house.

27:26.558 --> 27:28.080
The sword delivered the book.

27:29.663 --> 27:31.386
She told me about the house.

27:31.406 --> 27:34.711
And he's the one who told me it was the Shakespeare's.

27:34.751 --> 27:37.916
Don't you know what books they were?

27:37.936 --> 27:39.238
He was delivering the Shakespeare's.

27:39.579 --> 27:42.784
So, I mean, after he even had, you know, more detail on it.

27:42.884 --> 27:46.790
By the way, as an aside, Arthur Vershbow will know Joe Van Horn.

27:46.810 --> 27:48.753
And will know the story, whatever.

27:48.954 --> 27:52.920
You're famous in by Joe Van Horn, English press book.

27:52.940 --> 27:54.743
Because Arthur is very much connected with hope.

27:55.043 --> 27:57.386
as was Haven, as was Joe Van Horn.

27:57.406 --> 28:09.600
I think that the press books that were in the garden sale might have belonged to Joe Van Horn, and that's where Haven got them from, because of the best of my knowledge, unless you bought them from Colin Franklin.

28:09.620 --> 28:17.249
Not to give away too much, but I think that I could pretty much totally get it.

28:18.731 --> 28:24.898
In any case, as you can see, on the house, on that one in Oslo,

28:25.250 --> 28:28.914
Yeah, Priscilla told me about it, and I was curious about it.

28:28.934 --> 28:30.095
The one that looks like a fortress?

28:30.115 --> 28:30.375
Right.

28:30.776 --> 28:31.516
Is that Priscilla?

28:31.576 --> 28:32.497
No, it's a wooden house.

28:32.838 --> 28:35.661
There's a wooden house here, but there's one up here that looks like a fortress.

28:35.701 --> 28:38.303
Yes, right, but the wooden house is the one that's supposed to live at.

28:38.323 --> 28:38.603
Is that right?

28:38.624 --> 28:39.805
Right.

28:39.825 --> 28:52.978
But I looked up both houses, from my point of view, quickest way to find out whether somebody's actually living someplace and whether the house isn't in operation, if it's a private house.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.990
in almost every town in Massachusetts.

28:56.010 --> 28:57.152
There's one very simple way.

28:57.292 --> 29:00.177
You check to see if there's a water bill.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.123
To me, that's the easiest way of public utility.

29:03.143 --> 29:07.230
And I checked to find out if there was a water bill for this house, and there was no water bill.

29:07.851 --> 29:11.658
I was there one day in February, and it just snowed.

29:11.678 --> 29:14.443
And somebody had come and put some sand on it.

29:14.710 --> 29:19.059
To me, some of the things that we do is put some sand out there.

29:19.079 --> 29:28.197
And yet on the other hand, I have confirmation that they were living in that house, I don't know when.

29:28.531 --> 29:43.250
But Morrie Bromson, the autograph stealer, who is one of the most bizarre stories, if you talk to him, he will tell you, undoubtedly, that John Follinger's Urgenbeck's illegitimate son, and that Ken Rondell's money comes from the Mafia, and I mean, you know, he's just a total flake.

29:43.310 --> 29:46.614
I mean, this guy is approval for the first order when it comes to some of these stories.

29:46.915 --> 29:54.064
But he did sell Haven, the Walt Whitman Leaves of Grass, that was in the gardens there.

29:55.025 --> 29:57.188
And he...

29:57.927 --> 30:05.377
did some socializing with Haven and Luria after the sale of the book, or they went out to dinner a couple of times.

30:05.397 --> 30:15.851
And through Maury Bromson, Luria and Haven met Jonathan Joseph, who's an interior decorator here in Boston and was on the North Shore, who I happen to know.

30:15.871 --> 30:19.356
Jonathan Joseph is the expert on the American Honest Jane Peterson.

30:19.376 --> 30:21.439
He had his blended collection of Jane Peterson.

30:21.579 --> 30:26.145
And when he was doing the catalog resume on Jane Peterson, he needed some help

30:26.311 --> 30:39.035
editorial help, and I put them together with one of my old colleagues in Boston for publishing, and they did a beautiful book together, and I got thanked and whatever, which was very well received.

30:39.416 --> 30:46.990
Anyway, Jonathan was asked by Haven and Maria to go over and help, you know, and be the interior decorator for this house.

30:47.431 --> 30:48.353
He went in once,

30:49.210 --> 30:52.455
And it never came, nothing happened.

30:52.555 --> 30:53.537
Was there any furniture in there?

30:53.557 --> 30:54.578
No, there was no furniture.

30:54.598 --> 30:56.181
There was no furniture in the house.

30:56.201 --> 30:58.224
Yeah, there was no furniture.

30:58.244 --> 30:59.245
You had a second question.

30:59.265 --> 31:00.868
I mean, somebody else has told you.

31:00.888 --> 31:02.350
Yeah, it was... No, you can't sit down.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.954
It was pretty rustic.

31:05.795 --> 31:08.860
And... So where do they live?

31:10.563 --> 31:12.045
Well, they live, I... They live in the...

31:12.734 --> 31:14.258
I really think this is great.

31:14.278 --> 31:16.704
You're offering very valuable information.

31:16.865 --> 31:23.100
This is one of the great book dealers of our time, and you were his partner.

31:23.181 --> 31:28.093
And I was very much remiss in not writing all of his anecdotes and stories down, because he's a full

31:31.482 --> 31:37.510
He told some very silly jokes, but he had a real English sense of humor.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.494
He was always telling jokes, and always telling stories.

31:41.195 --> 31:44.840
And the stories about the Rosenberg were unbelievable.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.023
And you didn't write any of those stories?

31:47.503 --> 31:50.908
No, but I can remember a lot.

31:50.968 --> 31:55.494
Well, we don't want to remember some of the stories about Rosenberg.

31:55.534 --> 31:58.979
Yeah, some of them were pretty randy.

32:00.841 --> 32:01.422
But John...

32:02.127 --> 32:16.472
I was in New York usually two or three days a week working with him on his premises at 57th Street, and I did his behavior more quickly.

32:16.492 --> 32:17.313
This is from 83 on.

32:17.333 --> 32:20.138
This book was published in 83.

32:20.158 --> 32:27.190
This collection I bought in Argentina, a collection of Lee Dartis, and I got it up to Boston.

32:27.406 --> 32:35.598
And in January of 83, I asked John if he wanted to become my partner by half the collection and become my partner in that.

32:35.679 --> 32:36.961
Partnering?

32:37.061 --> 32:38.042
In this collection.

32:38.102 --> 32:38.863
For this project.

32:38.924 --> 32:40.005
He came to Boston?

32:40.025 --> 32:49.099
But with the proviso that any clients we got from it, we would share from now on, and that we would become partners in any book, any resulting business from this catalog.

32:49.119 --> 32:54.347
In other words, all new books and all new bindings were a joint venture from that time on.

32:54.427 --> 32:56.350
It's the first time he ever handled it.

32:56.954 --> 32:59.597
He'd never done it before.

33:00.398 --> 33:02.080
And the collection was really extraordinary.

33:02.100 --> 33:02.900
That's your catalog?

33:02.921 --> 33:03.041
Yeah.

33:03.241 --> 33:04.322
That's the first catalog.

33:05.103 --> 33:05.824
Yeah, sure.

33:06.344 --> 33:07.125
It's the first catalog.

33:07.866 --> 33:09.948
And... Is he going to do that?

33:09.968 --> 33:14.553
I'll tell you, that's an honor because this catalog is unobtainable.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.295
This catalog is unobtainable.

33:16.776 --> 33:18.638
And so we're going to get a gift or you're going to loan it to me.

33:18.978 --> 33:19.899
No, I'm going to give it to you.

33:19.919 --> 33:20.580
So you're going to scrap it?

33:20.600 --> 33:23.042
Yeah, I'll scrap it to you.

33:23.243 --> 33:26.286
And we had priced the collection at a million dollars.

33:27.076 --> 33:29.899
And we sold it on block before the catalog was published.

33:29.919 --> 33:31.061
So a private collection?

33:31.081 --> 33:32.642
Is someone you can tell me?

33:32.663 --> 33:33.423
No, I can't.

33:33.664 --> 33:34.084
That's good.

33:34.164 --> 33:35.646
But that's okay, too.

33:35.686 --> 33:36.607
How long ago was this?

33:37.188 --> 33:39.410
This was in 1986.

33:39.430 --> 33:44.596
But you could tell me that a private collector bought the collection on block.

33:44.616 --> 33:48.301
You mentioned the figure of a million dollars, but it wasn't necessary.

33:48.321 --> 33:51.184
But this collector is still an anonymous collector.

33:51.204 --> 33:51.705
Yes.

33:51.785 --> 33:54.568
But that's interesting, isn't it?

33:55.105 --> 33:56.386
A serious collective?

33:56.667 --> 33:57.888
I didn't give you any sex.

33:57.908 --> 34:01.852
I'm not trying to... I won't do that in the case right now.

34:01.872 --> 34:04.155
Remember, I told you there are three types of collectors.

34:04.295 --> 34:04.916
An American?

34:05.436 --> 34:06.818
You don't have to tell me.

34:06.838 --> 34:09.100
Yeah, I don't... Actually, I don't even know about that.

34:10.462 --> 34:11.983
Well, was it handled directly?

34:12.043 --> 34:14.646
No, absolutely directly.

34:14.866 --> 34:17.109
He was one of John's... The client was a client of John's.

34:17.129 --> 34:18.731
Let me tell you a story.

34:18.871 --> 34:22.835
I don't want to push you... A lot of people... But this is fascinating.

34:22.855 --> 34:23.796
This is fascinating.

34:24.468 --> 34:25.850
I remember it so distinctly.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.493
John came up to look at the collection.

34:29.454 --> 34:36.402
While we were at 89th century, he took one look at the collection and agreed with Priscilla.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.164
He was going to be partners with her.

34:38.325 --> 34:40.427
Pardon me, but you know what's developing here?

34:40.547 --> 34:48.737
I'm just thinking, I could just write about some of these great collections that are owned by private individuals without having to identify them.

34:49.156 --> 34:52.561
And to illustrate your point, it's a really good point.

34:52.601 --> 34:53.722
He's one type of collector.

34:53.842 --> 34:59.810
So if you talk about... What depresses me is this is the kind of car that steals the Vermeer, too.

35:00.451 --> 35:02.714
How can they enjoy the Vermeer very easily?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.777
But this guy pays for everything, believe me.

35:05.878 --> 35:07.040
But do you see what I'm saying?

35:07.060 --> 35:12.808
They say that, oh, it can't be for a fandom collector because you can't enjoy these things by yourself.

35:12.828 --> 35:13.589
Obviously you can.

35:14.991 --> 35:18.235
Let me continue with this, just to sort of bring it to a conclusion.

35:18.822 --> 35:22.126
John looked at the collection in Boston.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.867
He agreed with Priscilla 100%.

35:23.908 --> 35:26.270
The two of them came to an agreement.

35:26.290 --> 35:34.199
The next thing in the collection was being shipped to New York, and Priscilla and John had agreed that it was going to go on exhibit in John's premises.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.181
What a beautiful premises.

35:36.842 --> 35:44.890
And I was there, and the day the exhibits were being set up, and Brent, John's stuff, Andy Person, was setting up the exhibit.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.293
He had beautifully lit the exhibit.

35:47.813 --> 35:53.239
And there was a guest list, and people were being invited to an opening of this exhibit.

35:53.799 --> 35:57.102
And Priscilla was talking to John about so-and-so might buy it or so-and-so.

35:57.603 --> 36:00.166
John said to Priscilla, don't worry about that.

36:00.866 --> 36:02.048
We've already sold it.

36:02.968 --> 36:05.431
She said, but I'm just putting out the catalog, isn't it?

36:05.611 --> 36:05.851
No, no.

36:05.871 --> 36:07.473
Okay, well, you corrected that.

36:07.593 --> 36:08.294
No, no.

36:08.314 --> 36:14.260
We were having... Someone, one of John's collectors, had...

36:15.708 --> 36:18.351
John had told this person about the collection over the phone.

36:18.932 --> 36:25.800
The collector was out of the country in September, who was showing the collection, and I told him that this person was on vacation.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.804
You know, you can't get any of the profoundly wealthy in New York in September.

36:28.824 --> 36:30.586
And the catalog was still being produced.

36:30.606 --> 36:33.029
And the catalog was still being put in the box.

36:33.049 --> 36:33.930
It had not been produced.

36:34.050 --> 36:34.951
And I did all of that.

36:35.011 --> 36:36.393
I mean, I designed it.

36:36.493 --> 36:37.074
I designed it.

36:37.154 --> 36:37.634
I wrote it.

36:38.075 --> 36:40.177
I did the whole thing.

36:40.418 --> 36:42.100
Did you write all the stuff?

36:42.120 --> 36:45.023
Actually, it's Peter Wick and Ellingard.

36:45.408 --> 36:57.483
So this one collector had asked for first refusal for the collection en bloc.

36:59.225 --> 37:01.327
In the meantime... What did you call a serious player?

37:02.108 --> 37:03.230
Oh, very serious.

37:03.310 --> 37:12.681
In the meantime, another collector, called Cole, had heard about it from another dealer and wanted

37:13.100 --> 37:16.625
right of second refusal for the collection on block.

37:17.286 --> 37:25.799
In the meantime, about a week later, two weeks later, another one of John's clients called and said he was back in town and said, can we have lunch?

37:26.320 --> 37:32.629
And John invited the collector over, and I ran down with the first catalog.

37:33.049 --> 37:36.154
Only the plate, as you can see, it tipped him.

37:36.556 --> 37:37.817
and they weren't all tipped in.

37:37.837 --> 37:40.781
So I was still willing to place it in the kitchen.

37:40.821 --> 37:52.354
In the kitchen, when the client walked in, looked at the display, and said, how much did you say this collection was again?

37:52.414 --> 37:55.938
And John told him, and he said, well, I'll take it.

37:55.958 --> 37:56.659
Just like that.

37:56.679 --> 37:58.841
And the catalog wasn't finished.

37:58.921 --> 38:00.183
But you're still gluing in the plate.

38:00.203 --> 38:03.947
I'm still gluing in the plate, so I come running out, and John said, it's sold, don't worry about it.

38:05.682 --> 38:06.483
We had the party.

38:07.144 --> 38:19.903
Now, can you describe briefly, I'll read the catalog, but what made this collection such a desirable... Well, this collection... How did you get it, and nobody else?

38:20.363 --> 38:23.588
Oh, I bid against two very serious French dealers.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.651
Oh, so you got this at an auction?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.033
No, it was a private auction.

38:27.334 --> 38:29.336
In other words, the owner of the collection.

38:29.457 --> 38:30.318
It was a private sale.

38:30.638 --> 38:31.439
Private sale.

38:31.540 --> 38:33.883
The owner of the collection asked three dealers,

38:37.137 --> 38:40.962
And that's very common in the book business, by the way.

38:41.583 --> 38:47.431
Private dealers say, oh, absolutely.

38:48.553 --> 38:54.201
The collection, the family that owned this collection opened their paintings in the collection.

38:54.221 --> 39:00.670
And an art dealer, who was a friend, recommended me.

39:02.372 --> 39:04.495
And that was how I... That's a great story.

39:04.863 --> 39:06.245
I can use this, right?

39:06.265 --> 39:06.565
Oh, yeah.

39:06.585 --> 39:08.828
And I went to Argentina to buy the collection.

39:08.848 --> 39:09.608
For the first time.

39:09.829 --> 39:10.870
For the first time.

39:10.930 --> 39:12.832
And mind you, it was in 1882, the Falcons War.

39:12.872 --> 39:15.175
This is your first big... My first big buy.

39:15.275 --> 39:15.736
Big buy.

39:15.836 --> 39:16.356
Yeah.

39:16.376 --> 39:17.878
It was in 1882 in September.

39:18.158 --> 39:19.960
The Falcons War was in August.

39:19.980 --> 39:20.521
I was down there.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.243
I went down on the Falcons War.

39:23.104 --> 39:23.785
Got off the plane.

39:23.805 --> 39:24.626
They lost her luggage.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.828
She had to buy a whole new one.

39:26.888 --> 39:27.429
My bag.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.571
Yeah, my bag got there the day I left.

39:29.652 --> 39:32.535
That's an interesting match.

39:32.555 --> 39:33.256
But I went.

39:33.936 --> 39:34.397
I went.

39:34.799 --> 39:58.182
I was shown into the library, the main room of this apartment in Buenos Aires, and what could have been an awkward and unfortunate experience, because the owner of the collection was, the owners were elderly people who were not well.

39:58.402 --> 40:02.967
The wife was confined to bed, and the man was going on.

40:03.942 --> 40:14.504
There was this man who had loved beautiful things all of his life, and had bought beautiful things all of his life, and had gone wrong with him.

40:15.386 --> 40:16.808
But his tape was impeccable.

40:16.829 --> 40:18.231
Did you name these people on the book?

40:18.251 --> 40:20.115
No, they wished to remain anonymous.

40:20.135 --> 40:20.837
And that's fine.

40:21.017 --> 40:22.821
They had never committed that.

40:22.841 --> 40:23.402
And that's fine.

40:23.905 --> 40:25.267
You can do this in a book.

40:25.307 --> 40:26.929
I mean, what's the point?

40:26.989 --> 40:27.870
I mean, I don't have to.

40:28.070 --> 40:29.552
I mean, they're gone now.

40:29.672 --> 40:39.623
I mean, I understand that both of them, both of them, in a sense, passed away because I had such an example, who turned out to be wonderful people.

40:39.763 --> 40:41.886
They were so kind and so hospitable to me.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.129
What could have been a very trying situation.

40:44.149 --> 40:47.012
I mean, these things, the couple had no children.

40:47.032 --> 40:49.094
These books were their great love and passion.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.477
That's another theme I see there.

40:51.517 --> 40:51.677
Yeah.

40:51.697 --> 40:52.799
The Folger syndrome.

40:52.819 --> 40:53.119
Yeah.

40:58.567 --> 41:10.198
And actually, they wanted to sell the collection to divide the proceeds among their niches and methods, because there were several niches and methods from various groups and both.

41:12.020 --> 41:21.269
And what could have been really awkward and really unpleasant was made to be a very charming and wonderful experience.

41:21.289 --> 41:23.051
Did they speak English or used to speak French?

41:23.071 --> 41:24.092
No, we spoke French.

41:24.112 --> 41:24.593
French?

41:24.613 --> 41:25.013
Yeah.

41:25.668 --> 41:29.754
The people of Argentina, especially Buenos Aires, are very cosmopolitan law.

41:29.814 --> 41:30.936
They're very cosmopolitan law.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.018
I remember during that war.

41:32.038 --> 41:38.708
Well, also, French is a language that is spoken in many different places, and German as well, both languages.

41:38.728 --> 41:43.996
Yeah, they're very cosmopolitan law speaking Buenos Aires, although most of them speak English.

41:44.036 --> 41:46.179
These old gentlemen did not speak English very well.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.964
They spoke French, however perfectly.

41:49.184 --> 41:51.928
And his eye was great.

41:52.229 --> 41:58.458
And he had a collection of bindings and illustrated books that were put together in France in the 30s.

41:58.478 --> 41:59.960
And that's what his catalog is?

42:00.061 --> 42:01.142
That's what his catalog is.

42:01.162 --> 42:02.805
His catalog is his collection.

42:03.606 --> 42:06.350
And many of these books are from another great collection, right?

42:06.450 --> 42:06.670
Right.

42:06.790 --> 42:12.960
And these books come from another, the cream of this collection comes from another Argentinian collection.

42:12.980 --> 42:16.004
I think you have that color book.

42:16.024 --> 42:17.727
They're not pressed.

42:17.747 --> 42:18.167
They're great.

42:18.187 --> 42:18.348
Yeah.

42:18.528 --> 42:19.089
Five colors.

42:19.409 --> 42:21.392
They're doing the brochure for me now on the...

42:21.575 --> 42:34.751
This illustrates another point there, that great collections are the meat for a current collector.

42:34.771 --> 42:37.815
In other words, you want to know where the great collections are.

42:37.835 --> 42:46.847
So when they come up for sale, either privately at auction, but many times privately, those are the things you want to go after.

42:47.007 --> 42:49.590
And that's how I got most of my stuff.

42:50.752 --> 43:12.094
What this man did was when his friend died in Argentina, he bought from the widow a number of the best books in the ancient collection, the older collection.

43:12.875 --> 43:19.662
Although the rest of the collection went to auction to a dealer in Paris in the 40s.

43:21.025 --> 43:29.200
the late 40s, 49 or 50, and there was a catalog made of that collection.

43:29.220 --> 43:31.104
Actually, it was Carlo Scherer.

43:31.124 --> 43:40.041
That's not who I bought the collection from, but books from the Carlo Scherer collection formed the nucleus of this class.

43:40.061 --> 43:43.928
And that's documented.

43:44.313 --> 43:46.355
But that's documented in the description.

43:46.375 --> 43:48.578
Did they just invite American dealers?

43:48.618 --> 43:49.198
No.

43:49.238 --> 43:53.763
These books had never been told in the United States before.

43:53.783 --> 43:55.125
No one sold this book.

43:55.185 --> 43:56.746
It's a tremendous excitement.

43:57.047 --> 43:58.188
It's a brand new market.

43:58.208 --> 44:03.854
You have to understand, if you put yourself at that time, I looked at these books when they came in.

44:03.874 --> 44:06.156
In fact, I looked at the cards first.

44:06.176 --> 44:08.319
Ursula got the cards from Argentina.

44:08.339 --> 44:10.681
They were sent to her before she got the books.

44:11.582 --> 44:13.324
And I said, what kind of books are these?

44:13.743 --> 44:15.284
I have never seen these books.

44:15.585 --> 44:18.868
I've been collecting books for a whole week.

44:18.888 --> 44:25.194
The only person who knew about these books that I knew was Ellie Garvey at the Houghton Library.

44:25.214 --> 44:27.155
She was a good friend of mine.

44:27.175 --> 44:28.537
And I talked to her about it.

44:28.597 --> 44:37.325
And eventually, I persuaded Ellie Garvey to write the introduction to her sewing book.

44:37.425 --> 44:38.486
And Peter did it.

44:38.546 --> 44:42.990
And Peter also had been at the Houghton before Ellie.

44:43.308 --> 44:49.017
at the Museum of Fine Arts, and spent every summer in France.

44:49.217 --> 44:53.363
Peter Wick is a very international man and does know about these things.

44:53.383 --> 44:54.485
As a collector himself?

44:54.505 --> 44:54.785
Yeah.

44:55.005 --> 44:57.930
So this was virgin territory then?

44:58.010 --> 44:58.230
Absolutely.

44:58.250 --> 44:59.492
How do you describe it now?

44:59.572 --> 45:06.783
I mean, is it... The prices have gone so high that the books now are virtually unobtainable.

45:06.803 --> 45:09.187
You can't deal in what you can't buy.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.108
You like paintings.

45:11.185 --> 45:16.071
Like great paintings, like the Van Goghs and the Vermeers and those things.

45:16.091 --> 45:18.534
This book, let me show you, the Kirikho Kalygram.

45:18.654 --> 45:25.522
I don't even know what we had to price that individual.

45:25.542 --> 45:27.084
Did you distribute the catalog?

45:27.104 --> 45:27.484
Yeah.

45:27.744 --> 45:29.587
Well, we sold the catalog.

45:29.607 --> 45:32.810
At the time, the selling price was around $60,000.

45:32.911 --> 45:35.033
Did you get any...

45:36.177 --> 45:40.163
Any feedback from people who were unable to buy things out of it?

45:40.243 --> 46:02.213
A lot of that, but the main thing was that most of the real book libraries in this country bought this catalog as a reference book because it was the first time that there were accurate bibliographic descriptions in English of Great French Findings.

46:03.976 --> 46:05.037
This book right here.

46:05.540 --> 46:08.684
Apollinaire's Caligram was a host by De Quirico.

46:09.085 --> 46:10.347
This was in a Bonnet binding.

46:11.889 --> 46:14.813
It was spectacular.

46:14.833 --> 46:30.655
But a copy just went off in Paris with ten original or some original drawings by De Quirico in the book and a binding by Bonnet, and it made around $675,000.

46:30.775 --> 46:33.859
Now, that's one book in this collection that we sold for a million.

46:35.240 --> 46:35.560
Wow.

46:36.742 --> 46:37.703
This book right here.

46:37.723 --> 46:40.267
Do you kind of wish that you'd kept it there?

46:40.387 --> 46:42.330
Coulda, woulda, shoulda, you know.

46:42.350 --> 46:43.632
But you've got to do what you've got to do.

46:43.652 --> 46:45.895
My father always says, sell and repent.

46:45.915 --> 46:48.138
Sell and repent, but sell.

46:48.158 --> 46:49.219
What are you going to do?

46:49.299 --> 46:49.680
I mean, you know.

46:49.700 --> 46:50.201
What is to say?

46:50.221 --> 46:50.661
Who's to know?

46:50.681 --> 46:50.962
Yeah.

46:51.242 --> 46:54.887
This book right here, the Cirque des Trois-Tiles, by Rouault.

46:55.127 --> 46:56.129
That's one of the plays from it.

46:56.409 --> 46:58.492
It's one of Rouault's great clown series.

46:58.512 --> 47:00.775
And these are all original aquitans.

47:01.126 --> 47:27.606
used to routinely go when this catalog was done for around thirty five thirty thousand dollars now the book sells for around eighty five thousand dollars and if you get one of the tirage detect one of the detect the special copies of an extra suite the price is a quarter of a million dollars unbound this is that's unbound that's without you know what were the limitations on this on the catalog oh on the book on the book oh 100 200

47:27.856 --> 47:35.790
And then there's always a special number of copies that have an extra suite or two extra suites, and those are called the detec copies.

47:35.890 --> 47:39.196
And they're on a different paper usually, and the suites are on different paper.

47:39.216 --> 47:44.045
But these bindings, that's what made this collection great, the bindings that were on the book.

47:44.205 --> 47:47.851
Not only were they the best copies of the book, but these bindings are extraordinary.

47:48.212 --> 47:49.915
This binding right here on...

47:50.975 --> 48:01.966
It's by Paul Bonnet, and he writes that there was Carlos Schauer's copy, the great Argentinian collector, and Bonnet's first great patron, Bonnet being the great binder of the 20th century.

48:02.367 --> 48:07.292
He says, this binding is the first on which I've encrusted plaques of ivory.

48:07.893 --> 48:17.843
The color of the illustration has determined the color of the Morocco, and I have tinted and given a precious aura

48:17.941 --> 48:24.891
to this constructive architectural binding, a jewel-like quality of this architectural binding.

48:24.911 --> 48:25.833
Are these artworks?

48:27.015 --> 48:28.297
These bindings?

48:28.317 --> 48:28.857
I think so.

48:29.198 --> 48:31.702
I mean, we aren't really talking about books as books.

48:31.722 --> 48:32.583
We're talking about that.

48:32.623 --> 48:34.726
I mean, we're at another level, wouldn't you say?

48:35.527 --> 48:36.249
A different level.

48:38.171 --> 48:41.036
I mean, certainly text is not the goal here, right?

48:41.056 --> 48:43.700
Oh, but the text is always beautifully printed, enhanced.

48:43.940 --> 48:47.205
It is very much in the tradition of beautiful printing.

48:47.320 --> 49:00.633
I mean, a lot of these books were printed to the early Vollard publications, or the Kahnweiler publications, were printed by Durantier, who was one of the great printers here of the 20th century, who printed the James Joyce Ulysses in France.

49:00.653 --> 49:04.937
The collector here is really collecting a kind of beauty.

49:05.237 --> 49:05.638
Indeed.

49:06.038 --> 49:17.209
Indeed, and he's collecting original art, because all of these books are illustrated with original lithographs or original etchings or original... Something we have to... I have to... Drive points.

49:17.695 --> 49:19.838
I mean, that's the whole point about Leonard Baskin's eyes.

49:19.878 --> 49:23.502
They're all original eyes, or aquatins, or whatever.

49:23.743 --> 49:30.411
And this binding, for example, is on a Picasso, published by Kahnweiler.

49:30.431 --> 49:39.062
And this is Picasso's second or third Cubist book, published in 1914, which is really early for Cubism.

49:39.346 --> 49:42.549
These books are a major, major part of Picasso's work.

49:42.570 --> 49:52.380
You can't, I mean, an art history student couldn't study Picasso's work without taking into account the books that he did, because his evolving styles are exhibited in his books as well.

49:52.400 --> 49:58.106
Did you see that book that was published as a Zoe, that they did the book on Picasso's... Yeah.

49:58.126 --> 50:02.591
Yeah, yeah, and the recent catalog, Braque and Picasso, Inventing Cubism.

50:04.313 --> 50:07.817
But that, I mean, that's the sort of thing that...

50:08.033 --> 50:10.717
You'd be very proud of it.

50:11.377 --> 50:11.858
Yeah.

50:12.179 --> 50:18.227
Well, also, because that's the first time that ever happened, that John Fleming put his name on a title page with another person.

50:18.327 --> 50:21.471
And that's your first catalog?

50:21.511 --> 50:21.751
Yeah.

50:22.132 --> 50:23.794
It's like the Gutenberg Bible.

50:23.814 --> 50:24.815
How do you beat it?

50:24.936 --> 50:26.938
Well, let me show you the second one.

50:27.199 --> 50:30.203
The collection was smaller, but this is nice.

50:30.223 --> 50:34.969
The collection was put together a little bit later.

50:34.989 --> 50:36.471
This is the second catalog, too.

50:38.425 --> 50:40.287
And there are mostly bunny bindings.

50:41.308 --> 50:45.773
Is that an extraordinary look at this?

50:45.813 --> 50:49.757
There's no sound coming for me when I come to listen.

50:49.777 --> 50:50.037
Unreal.

50:50.558 --> 50:52.580
Isn't that beautiful?

50:52.600 --> 50:55.143
Priscilla, where did you develop this expertise?

50:55.203 --> 50:56.764
By handling that collection.

50:56.784 --> 50:57.045
Really?

50:57.665 --> 51:04.353
And having the great good fortune to have a collector ask me to help him build a great collection.

51:06.154 --> 51:07.656
This is not the same collection?

51:07.822 --> 51:08.863
It is the same collector.

51:09.745 --> 51:18.175
And it's thanks to him that... That's the first time anybody's said anything like that to me.

51:18.196 --> 51:21.640
I have handled... You have to be excited with a quote like that.

51:21.660 --> 51:24.864
It's really thanks to him that I've... Thanks to the collector.

51:24.944 --> 51:26.006
Thanks to the collector.

51:26.026 --> 51:33.576
I've had the great good fortune, thanks to him, to handle more of these books than anyone else in the country.

51:33.596 --> 51:35.077
But the collector has forced you to learn, though.

51:35.118 --> 51:36.259
He's forced me to learn.

51:36.661 --> 51:38.063
And Emler and I did.

51:38.143 --> 51:42.007
Because the collector trusted you to build the collection.

51:42.588 --> 51:46.893
You see this... Not quite.

51:46.953 --> 51:48.195
Well, let's say that was a question.

51:48.655 --> 51:55.283
Well, first of all, you should know that I grew up in a home where art was talked about all the time.

51:55.323 --> 51:57.926
My father collected paintings.

51:57.946 --> 52:04.474
And his favorite school of paintings was the School of Paris, the Impressionists and the Post-Impressionists was in the School of Paris.

52:04.910 --> 52:06.192
So I got to learn.

52:06.692 --> 52:09.076
Does he have impressionist painting?

52:09.096 --> 52:10.077
Yes, yes.

52:10.818 --> 52:13.201
And I... French impressionist painting?

52:13.221 --> 52:15.244
French impressionist in French school in Paris.

52:15.284 --> 52:15.885
Yeah.

52:17.387 --> 52:23.876
And I did, and I did learn about them at an early age.

52:24.416 --> 52:32.908
Now when I found out that these same artists, Barnard and Picasso and Braque and Matisse, also did books, which was my great love, because I had been working

52:33.108 --> 52:35.991
I said, oh, my God!

52:36.151 --> 52:38.693
I worked for Harcourt for seven years.

52:38.713 --> 52:41.296
My first job was secretary to Bill Yovanovitch.

52:43.618 --> 53:01.495
When I found out that these very same artists working with their great art dealers, Ambrose Rollard and Daniel Kahnweiler, who were the main art dealers who were responsible for getting these people accepted, and I mean, Rollard, you know.

53:02.167 --> 53:14.442
I just thought it was a match made in heaven.

53:15.063 --> 53:19.108
But I didn't know where I would ever get these books for stock.

53:20.009 --> 53:25.717
And I didn't know how I would ever get to handle them because it's a very capital intensive.

53:28.039 --> 53:28.620
Inventory.

53:29.101 --> 53:29.782
Yeah.

53:30.242 --> 53:31.684
Am I right?

53:31.883 --> 54:00.625
um and when i found this collection i couldn't believe my very good fortune because it's one thing to hear about the book so to look at one page under glass is another thing to sit down and catalog the book and live with it and live with these books and look at the bindings um and that's the other thing i did not know about these one-of-a-kind designer bindings until i saw this collection in argentina it came as a revelation to me that that that someone would would go out and commission a binding

54:01.043 --> 54:13.459
and leave it to another artist's good sense, or artist's good sense, in the case of Paul Bonnet, who wrote that there, to put a binding on a book with original etchings by Picasso in it.

54:13.479 --> 54:14.280
What if they ruin it?

54:15.241 --> 54:17.243
But that's so paradoxical when you come to a book.

54:17.283 --> 54:24.893
A book, the whole concept of printing is to make different copies of things available.

54:25.193 --> 54:30.460
We still want things in first edition to give a thing as a function for the creative process.

54:31.115 --> 54:36.441
Here you have examples of books that are printed that have unique... Unique findings on them.

54:36.461 --> 54:37.001
Unique findings.

54:37.021 --> 54:38.082
So it does make them one of a kind.

54:38.102 --> 54:39.264
Yes, it does make them one of a kind.

54:39.324 --> 54:43.848
Even though there may be 200 copies of the book, they're not going to have this binding.

54:43.929 --> 54:51.076
Although Bonnet surely did work, he surely did do findings in the same theme on the same book.

54:51.156 --> 54:59.485
I mean, he bound, for example, this book, the Tatarand de Tarascon with the Whittos by Ducey, which is probably Ducey's best color whistle book.

55:00.241 --> 55:26.097
usually when he bound this book yeah that's a butterfly binding that's the only one he did on this book but usually when he bound this book um he put a lion's head on it um it's the bonnet de leon binding and he's done several of them uh and um the butterflies work as well you know the story of tetra isn't an intrepid hunter he went out and hunted lions and he collected butterflies and he was a

55:26.397 --> 55:30.643
a wanderer, an adventurer, a kind of larger-than-life character.

55:30.663 --> 55:32.245
And the butterflies work well.

55:32.586 --> 55:36.972
I mean, I happen to think that this may be Bonnet's most beautiful binding, certainly his most ambitious.

55:39.736 --> 55:43.982
But the TÃªte de Lyon binding is also very much sought after.

55:44.302 --> 55:45.684
What do they do with the original binding?

55:46.526 --> 55:47.447
Oh, there are none.

55:47.467 --> 55:50.752
They come on paper wrappers.

55:50.872 --> 55:52.334
I'll show you.

55:52.534 --> 55:53.215
All French books look the same.

55:53.916 --> 55:55.358
They have paper wrappers on them.

55:55.591 --> 56:06.521
So we're really not altering anything.

56:06.581 --> 56:16.271
Oh no, the point was, in France, if you bought a book, you went out and commissioned to bind it.

56:16.291 --> 56:20.515
I mean, they still don't make price of a book in France.

56:20.535 --> 56:23.978
That's why they call it the French, what do they call it, French,

56:24.886 --> 56:28.230
It's a paperback book, but they call it French rap or something like that.

56:28.250 --> 56:32.514
I've seen that crazy, classy way of saying paperbacks as issues.

56:32.534 --> 56:32.955
Well, as issues.

56:33.015 --> 56:34.737
As issues in rappers.

56:35.738 --> 56:38.101
This is an education for me today.

56:38.121 --> 56:39.822
The French is new.

56:39.903 --> 56:40.884
Yeah.

56:41.524 --> 56:48.672
There was one other person, I have to say, and that's Bernie Brad Gollard.

56:49.813 --> 56:53.277
He's certainly published with him, but he's going to have, or more, but he's in the 70s.

56:53.297 --> 56:53.998
He's been doing this for some time.

56:54.451 --> 57:04.465
Berna Brezza specializes in findings of all periods, whereas I don't have the expertise early even though I haven't had it when I did a specialties.

57:05.767 --> 57:10.834
Which was born in 1900 when Bonnard did the parallel morpholite.

57:10.854 --> 57:16.823
Right, the books illustrated by Picasso, and Jung, and Blot.

57:16.843 --> 57:19.767
What's going on right now?
