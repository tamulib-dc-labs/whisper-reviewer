WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:32.502
anywhere inside too um you're telling me that you brought out these marvelous these these high spots in the collection to show these women i guess from from you have a friend of mine uh uh uh actually the older one was a marvelous person and they have been so enthusiastic about this visit and uh yeah the girl is uh head of the philosophy department at the school

00:33.882 --> 00:34.623
It's St.

00:34.843 --> 00:37.127
Joseph's College.

00:37.327 --> 00:40.772
It's about the size of Holy Cross English.

00:40.892 --> 00:49.645
And the other one is much older, but still teaches French, I guess.

00:49.665 --> 00:52.810
So it's the first time I've ever been here.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.714
And I took him to lunch.

00:55.734 --> 00:58.638
And so I've been hearing about it ever since.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.743
Maybe it's a letter from Washington.

01:01.983 --> 01:02.404
My wife said,

01:02.738 --> 01:09.224
Well, they came from Buffalo and he was an orthopedic surgeon there.

01:09.505 --> 01:12.648
The family's pretty much down in that area.

01:12.668 --> 01:13.869
She's got it down there.

01:13.889 --> 01:20.255
One's married with the children.

01:20.275 --> 01:25.620
And so we'll get back to Alice's sister from them, saying what a marvelous time they had up here.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.543
The thing that they saw, I never expected to see.

01:28.777 --> 01:30.339
That's the way it hits people.

01:30.719 --> 01:31.520
It hits everyone.

01:31.540 --> 01:35.024
I mean, if you have any feeling at all for American history.

01:35.044 --> 01:41.010
Now, you have, God knows how many thousands of documents and manuscripts and items out here.

01:41.030 --> 01:46.015
And what amazed me, last year, when you walked me through, you just seemed to know where everything is.

01:46.275 --> 01:48.558
And you said, oh, this will, I remember, now, I'll never forget the quote.

01:48.898 --> 01:51.661
Oh, we have things here that'll make your mouth water.

01:51.901 --> 01:53.102
And you get so excited.

01:53.703 --> 01:56.306
And it's, to me, it's, you know, it's like that of language.

01:56.326 --> 01:57.467
This is the kind of thing that

01:57.869 --> 02:04.957
that I really feel the electricity, you know, but you walk out there and you must say, oh, look at this, and you'll pull out this new thing.

02:04.977 --> 02:07.921
Well, you know, some of them are very moving.

02:08.822 --> 02:20.956
I remember having a friend of mine, we were in service together, we met, actually, in Aberdam, we had the Persian Gulf.

02:21.737 --> 02:24.720
We were made cryptography.

02:25.038 --> 02:31.207
Well, my first year was when I went in.

02:31.307 --> 02:35.412
I was spying everyone that day, and I was 33 at the time.

02:35.432 --> 02:36.213
So you were spying?

02:38.296 --> 02:38.657
Yeah.

02:38.757 --> 02:45.386
They said, oh, well, I guess you'll be going into the Echo instead of the McDales assigned to military police.

02:46.648 --> 02:53.357
Well, we had some infantry training for a year, and then I was sucked out of that.

02:54.434 --> 02:58.779
the University of New Hampshire, and we were examined and so on.

02:58.799 --> 03:03.304
We ended up by going to the University of Pennsylvania, pretty arrogant.

03:03.324 --> 03:11.113
Well, we were there for nine months, and by the time we were ready to do anything, we were supposed to go to French, North Africa.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.639
Well, about that time, the Americans were consistently.

03:16.659 --> 03:20.604
They cut the whole program, wiped it out.

03:20.624 --> 03:21.825
So we sent down, we were

03:22.413 --> 03:35.006
Mariner Tennessee, which is a B-24 base, and we spent about three months there just doing time, doing all these silly things, close order drill, gas drill, and all this other business.

03:35.026 --> 03:36.007
And that was May.

03:36.067 --> 03:50.361
We were shipped to Virginia, and we were there for a couple of weeks, and then we went across on June 1st in a convoy of 84 ships.

03:51.202 --> 04:03.738
And we were at sea on D-Day, so we had to have radio balance, there could be no communication.

04:03.758 --> 04:11.568
And we went right from there, right through Frosty, Atlantic, and through the Mediterranean to Egypt.

04:11.588 --> 04:19.858
And we were there for a little while, and we were put in the code room to learn how to candle laugh, and then once or so later,

04:20.378 --> 04:33.352
I was going out that way, and they put me on a plane, and I flew from there to Aberdeen by the Arabian Peninsula.

04:33.532 --> 04:35.674
It was dark, and it was campfires.

04:35.694 --> 04:36.335
And I was there.

04:37.616 --> 04:44.603
They said that it wouldn't keep us there more than four months, because it was so hot.

04:44.744 --> 04:45.945
Well, I was there 11 months.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.968
The temperature there, it was when I left

04:49.673 --> 04:58.684
Abaddon will go back to Cairo, to Payne Field, which is now the Egyptian National Air Force.

04:58.704 --> 05:03.669
It was 118 degrees in air-cooled temperature.

05:03.690 --> 05:12.520
That means it shrouded from the directly right of it or something, and 135.

05:12.540 --> 05:18.567
There was a book written about the Persian Gulf Command, and a fellow claimed it was a temperature of 118 degrees.

05:19.154 --> 05:38.685
You know, you couldn't, you worked in the morning and late.

05:39.446 --> 05:45.516
It was north, south coming down to the

05:45.800 --> 05:52.349
We had a Russian detachment on that basin.

05:52.369 --> 06:00.160
Plains would come over in parts, we put together, then turned over to the Russian flights.

06:01.101 --> 06:04.787
Sometimes they made out, sometimes they didn't.

06:05.247 --> 06:09.934
And then there was a truck load that went right up to Russia.

06:09.954 --> 06:15.081
So we had that for quite a while, and then the Russians pulled out.

06:15.331 --> 06:19.014
It was an interesting country.

06:19.515 --> 06:27.863
And some of the people became very close friends.

06:27.883 --> 06:30.625
And they were all a thick group anyway.

06:31.366 --> 06:34.028
And most of them were interested in seeing places.

06:34.469 --> 06:37.552
And after you did your day's work, you were on shifts around the clock.

06:37.972 --> 06:39.894
You were afraid you'd go out.

06:39.914 --> 06:42.216
So we went to the Caldees.

06:42.719 --> 06:49.569
just because we had to get an office to go to the top ranks from a frozen one in all the states.

06:49.589 --> 06:53.275
And if you get somebody who would be with you in the truck, you could go places.

06:53.295 --> 07:10.060
So we went into Iraq, into the city where the Cowleys, and in the 20s, the British Museum, and the University of Pennsylvania, of all places, had a joint expedition there to try to get to the level of the great flood.

07:11.035 --> 07:14.741
And you could look up and you could see little oil lamps and everything else in the face.

07:14.761 --> 07:18.667
And you looked up and you could see humans sort of down into a big, big pit.

07:18.687 --> 07:22.012
And there are these things just sparkling all over.

07:22.032 --> 07:23.735
And you know, the light was passing on the wall.

07:23.775 --> 07:26.138
It was just mud all the way up.

07:26.178 --> 07:26.739
It was fascinating.

07:26.759 --> 07:29.303
What a feeling, what a feeling must be that little parts of it.

07:29.423 --> 07:30.165
Ed Laws.

07:30.185 --> 07:31.927
It was a marvelous feeling.

07:32.528 --> 07:34.030
But walking through one of these places.

07:34.111 --> 07:35.693
It's a great ziggurat, you know, there.

07:35.977 --> 07:39.982
And we get up to the top.

07:40.102 --> 07:47.090
And I guess they were carrying out some maneuvers there, the Iraqi army, that we could hear firing and we could see in the distance the river.

07:48.151 --> 08:00.064
And then we went up to the site of the Trabolonian captivity.

08:00.865 --> 08:05.190
And there was the tomb of Daniel that's supposed to go on again.

08:05.339 --> 08:07.862
which appeared in all the Iranian currency at the time.

08:09.585 --> 08:16.935
And then there was a shrine where Daniel was buried, surrounded by ironware.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.798
And then there were some houses close by, really.

08:19.818 --> 08:23.924
So you nourished your brain while you were in the middle of the desert, didn't you?

08:24.625 --> 08:27.349
Oh, no, we went out, and whenever we could, yes.

08:27.809 --> 08:32.916
And a lot of Iraq had been with the Princeton Arabs, but we were a pen when they were a Princeton.

08:33.790 --> 08:41.400
And I think that was what happened to the Arabian student mother that actually came up there.

08:43.203 --> 08:48.991
The dialect was different from North Africa and Egypt.

08:49.011 --> 08:52.616
You know, you could understand common words.

08:52.636 --> 08:54.038
So it was exciting.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.461
And if you're interested in travel, it was fun.

08:56.601 --> 08:59.545
And one of the things that amused me most was

09:00.757 --> 09:08.028
These ladies were there hoping to pray at Daniel's tomb, hoping to become pregnant.

09:08.249 --> 09:19.025
And then if they were successful, then they would give their probably most precious home ornaments.

09:19.045 --> 09:23.372
And when I was surprised to find all these kitchen clocks,

09:24.618 --> 09:26.020
All came from Connecticut.

09:26.220 --> 09:41.160
And I met one of the big men down at the Connecticut Historical Society and told him about all of those out there, and he was so amused.

09:42.302 --> 09:48.390
Are you familiar at all with the Hague?

09:48.650 --> 09:49.191
Did you know Dr. Houghton?

09:49.576 --> 09:52.340
No, he would not, but I didn't know him, no.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.565
Or Harrison Hornblatt, I guess, was quite a collector.

09:55.585 --> 09:56.166
I knew him.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.027
I met him.

09:57.428 --> 09:58.890
He was in scientific stuff.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.092
Yeah, but he just quit.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.115
He died a little while ago.

10:02.135 --> 10:02.416
Yes.

10:02.456 --> 10:11.910
But he and Houghton are examples of collectors who had put together a spread of collections and then just a board with it, I guess, and stuff.

10:12.210 --> 10:13.933
Do you think that was the reason?

10:14.274 --> 10:15.195
I don't know.

10:15.563 --> 10:17.646
No, I met him somewhere.

10:17.666 --> 10:17.986
I don't know.

10:18.106 --> 10:19.608
I'll just kind of throw that out.

10:20.409 --> 10:21.931
I've heard it suggested.

10:21.991 --> 10:24.735
Why do people stop collecting?

10:24.775 --> 10:26.076
Roger Scott said this.

10:27.398 --> 10:34.747
I'd be curious to know why some people stop collecting, you know, as much as I would be as to learn why they start.

10:35.749 --> 10:38.392
We're talking about the personality and the motivations, I guess.

10:38.712 --> 10:42.297
Well, I think I knew Matt Jones, who was one of my favorite people.

10:43.036 --> 10:48.825
He was a collector, but he would eventually give his, he had a Vermont collection.

10:48.845 --> 10:52.590
I don't know whether he gave it or sold it to the American Antiquarians.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.351
Matt Jones.

10:53.451 --> 10:54.333
Matt B. Jones.

10:54.813 --> 10:55.995
He was president of New England.

10:56.015 --> 10:58.779
He was still in town.

10:58.799 --> 11:00.141
He was a man I met when I came here.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.645
He was almost like a father from 1911.

11:02.665 --> 11:04.387
Then he had a Vermont collection.

11:04.407 --> 11:07.632
Yeah, he had built a Vermont collection.

11:07.672 --> 11:11.558
Then he started in another field, and he built quite a lot of things.

11:12.382 --> 11:20.652
And he gave us, we bought some, he gave us some money to buy from the boys, but he too wanted to pretend people have a chance to have an interview.

11:21.133 --> 11:24.216
And so, oh, he was a wonderful man.

11:24.697 --> 11:28.301
And then Tom Streeter was his great pal.

11:28.321 --> 11:34.369
They were both graduates, you see, and they'd come here to Mr. Jones' house on the eve of the Harvard Department.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.972
They'd always come over here to see if they were duplicating.

11:37.559 --> 11:44.570
I said, well, when I do this again, they would come here to the Society to see what?

11:44.590 --> 11:49.118
See if there are any duplicate copies, because Mr. Jones at that time was trying to weed out duplicates.

11:49.138 --> 11:51.722
Sometimes they'd have five copies of the same thing, you know.

11:51.742 --> 11:53.144
But I mean, why would he look here?

11:53.385 --> 11:57.712
Well, he knew that there was, he knew Mr. Jones, he knew that there were some things that he might be interested in.

11:58.153 --> 11:58.954
Oh, I see.

11:59.415 --> 12:01.318
So he could buy some of these things.

12:01.438 --> 12:02.740
I see.

12:02.838 --> 12:06.283
later they were in the sale.

12:06.403 --> 12:18.379
I read a, I picked up a small book, a series of lectures, and it was at the University of Minnesota, and book collectors and scholarship, and this fellow Wright, I think his name is, who was out of the Folger Library for some time.

12:19.261 --> 12:19.761
Louie Wright.

12:19.881 --> 12:21.444
Louie Wright, yeah.

12:21.684 --> 12:32.018
He said, he wrote, and I have this book at home, that if it weren't for book collectors, and who in turn made their stuff up,

12:32.403 --> 12:39.171
directed their stuff to institutions, that there would be aspects of American history and American culture that would be lost.

12:40.232 --> 12:46.420
And he cited as two examples, Huntington and Folger, of course, Folger, because he worked there.

12:46.440 --> 13:00.917
And he also says that it is almost unique in the United States to have research libraries such as this, such as the Antiquarian Society, such as the Huntington, such as the Folger, such as the Morgan, such as the Newbury, and everything.

13:00.937 --> 13:01.718
But a dozen of them

13:03.368 --> 13:27.790
that are basically institutions that were founded upon the collections of individuals who also had the foresight to endow these things in the establishment and he said you don't find this anyplace else i mean you agree with that you think that you think that's a fear assessment uh well i i don't know though i i am equipped to answer that because um

13:28.698 --> 13:30.661
It's interesting though.

13:30.681 --> 13:31.221
They are.

13:31.381 --> 13:43.237
And you get sea collectors and they do a great service because eventually out of them some can use a book called bibliography of some of them like almanacs and things like that, music.

13:43.297 --> 13:45.840
We had a number of people working on sheet music.

13:45.860 --> 13:47.702
Driscoll had a great collection.

13:47.722 --> 13:50.866
I don't know what, I think finally the Newbury Library got it.

13:50.886 --> 13:53.710
It's the sheet music, you know.

13:58.702 --> 14:06.973
Now, we're indebted to collectors who know so much about their particular subject.

14:07.474 --> 14:10.277
They're the ones who can tell you to see it.

14:10.337 --> 14:12.681
They've been working on the field for 10 years or so.

14:12.701 --> 14:13.942
They know what they're talking about.

14:13.962 --> 14:19.089
Well, Bradley Martin is said to have been putting authority on ornithology.

14:20.932 --> 14:22.253
And then why didn't he keep it?

14:22.313 --> 14:23.535
Well, he's the same way.

14:23.655 --> 14:24.797
He felt.

14:24.817 --> 14:28.101
I talked to Nicholas Barker about this, and I talked to him who knew him.

14:28.587 --> 14:32.252
And I talked to John Marion from South and Leeds last week, who knew him.

14:33.013 --> 14:40.644
This fellow I'm going to see later this week, Dave Kirschenbaum, I guess, had lunch with him three days a week, and they're largely responsible for him getting many of the things that he got.

14:41.606 --> 14:53.182
And so far from these three people who knew him well, have said, you know, if he was so meticulous in everything he did, if he really wanted these things to remain as a library, he would have done it.

14:53.322 --> 14:54.504
He would have taken care of it.

14:54.824 --> 14:56.687
But he, as the others you've mentioned,

14:57.342 --> 15:02.229
felt, hey, where would I have gotten my books if it weren't for other collectors?

15:02.329 --> 15:04.312
Let's give it a new life out there.

15:04.472 --> 15:08.718
Everything shouldn't necessarily go into an institution.

15:08.819 --> 15:08.979
Right.

15:09.039 --> 15:11.643
Some ought to have the fun of collecting.

15:12.003 --> 15:14.787
I mean, it was fun for an awful lot of them.

15:14.807 --> 15:16.329
And they were forcing them to cut me.

15:17.511 --> 15:18.192
Well, that's obvious.

15:18.212 --> 15:18.653
Yeah.

15:18.733 --> 15:22.639
I mean, they're not going to go out and get the big things they want.

15:24.201 --> 15:26.404
No, I've seen a lot.

15:26.890 --> 15:32.257
because of mostly academics who were coming in.

15:32.437 --> 15:38.585
And because they are doing research, they have people from England else just now.

15:38.926 --> 15:49.880
And another point that should be made about the Martin collection, while it is, was perhaps the finest collection, there were ornithological books in one collection, they were unique.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.963
We weren't talking about manuscript things.

15:52.583 --> 15:56.188
I mean, there were Audubons, there were Audubons, they were all, because they're everywhere.

15:56.641 --> 16:01.047
So, why not let the collectors have a whack at it?

16:01.067 --> 16:03.750
We're talking about really unique manuscript items.

16:03.770 --> 16:11.540
If you've got, you know, the only surviving copy of Audubon's Field Notes, well, that should be an institution, I would think, and it has to go to scholars.

16:11.961 --> 16:13.723
Well, these things are moving around.

16:13.863 --> 16:22.995
I mean, a while back, one of the trustees was Groton School.

16:24.337 --> 16:25.158
Which school?

16:25.178 --> 16:25.518
Groton.

16:25.659 --> 16:25.939
Groton School.

16:26.847 --> 16:34.797
some of the things up there that they were in a building which didn't seem to have any protection, and asked me if I'd go up and look.

16:34.817 --> 16:42.968
So I went out and churned up into a building, there were all the letters of presence on the wall, open front and rear, nobody there.

16:44.329 --> 16:52.720
And so as a result, they placed with us, if it was a presence, and also the elephant

16:53.324 --> 16:55.547
portfolio of autobots.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.330
Had that just there sitting in this room?

16:57.390 --> 17:15.779
No, those weren't in that room, but these things are, and, and, and, and, so, I, yeah, and they, I don't know, they lacked two or three, only two or three, uh, and, um, so, they placed them down with us.

17:16.981 --> 17:19.044
They, uh, so you have an autobot there?

17:19.304 --> 17:20.586
No, no.

17:20.606 --> 17:21.728
They took them out and sold them.

17:22.670 --> 17:23.652
They broke it up, too?

17:24.393 --> 17:27.799
They sold them to a dealer who I'm sure broke them up and sold things individually.

17:27.819 --> 17:28.740
What do you feel about that?

17:30.623 --> 17:36.153
Well, there aren't any people who'll be able to buy another portfolio.

17:36.173 --> 17:38.196
Look, Japanese just spent three million dollars.

17:38.216 --> 17:38.877
Three million dollars.

17:38.897 --> 17:40.460
Well, we had a set here.

17:41.782 --> 17:42.784
We're in the early days.

17:43.806 --> 17:46.550
And it was sold for $5,000.

17:46.590 --> 17:46.851
Sold?

17:47.031 --> 17:48.694
Yes, it was sold.

17:49.703 --> 17:50.824
By the society?

17:50.984 --> 17:51.805
By the society.

17:51.905 --> 17:52.926
Oh, that's horrible.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.328
Yeah, well, it was way, way back.

17:55.148 --> 17:56.209
Well, but they needed it.

17:56.229 --> 17:59.633
They probably just needed the money, and it wasn't.

17:59.653 --> 18:04.157
It was there, but there were a lot of copies around.

18:04.177 --> 18:06.359
And when I saw a $3 million star, you know.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.863
Well, the story of the antiquarian society is even worse.

18:09.883 --> 18:14.327
When Audubon was trying to sell the thing, he went through Worcester, and twice they wouldn't talk to him.

18:14.347 --> 18:16.369
They were too busy.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.781
That's documented.

18:17.801 --> 18:18.823
You know, he came through.

18:18.903 --> 18:21.666
And Marcus says, well, hey, he was just another bookseller in those days.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.410
He was just trying to sell his book.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.071
Well, he was.

18:25.091 --> 18:27.193
I think we have some other letters here.

18:29.556 --> 18:35.844
But, no, I went out to a house, and some of these great things were sold, and the big, big sales of the labeling.

18:36.145 --> 18:41.571
And, what do you want?

18:41.591 --> 18:42.693
It's a natural history.

18:44.175 --> 18:45.276
Great, great volumes.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.687
the house of one of these friends out here.

18:48.707 --> 18:52.532
Well, this was not our field.

18:53.173 --> 19:05.250
But what we did get, we got the papers that we didn't know were Chinese, the Unitarians, the father of the Unitarians, and things like that.

19:05.350 --> 19:14.503
So we came away with a great collection, and also a collection of such great

19:14.669 --> 19:17.732
And she's the wife of the Miner.

19:17.832 --> 19:25.901
The Miners were here in the east, the Sedgwick from the west, and they were this wonderful cross-state correspondence that went on all the time.

19:25.921 --> 19:35.152
Then the Sedgwick, the first woman to write the page.

19:35.172 --> 19:35.392
Really?

19:35.432 --> 19:35.812
Yeah.

19:35.832 --> 19:38.035
And so we have her diaries and so forth here.

19:38.715 --> 19:41.959
Eliza Sedgwick.

19:43.120 --> 20:06.345
I think what you're saying, in other words, is that focus is everything in a collection, too.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.128
You can't collect the world.

20:09.597 --> 20:17.011
And I think that's one of the great things about this area.

20:17.312 --> 20:22.061
On the whole, they're trying to collect to their collecting fields.

20:22.281 --> 20:26.509
Here, how we collect literary things, we don't collect them.

20:27.890 --> 20:32.258
But the thing that might come to us, we both know that— Except you have two years before the Mass, though.

20:32.278 --> 20:32.438
Yeah.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.300
That's an exception.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.484
That's part of the huge collection of DNA.

20:35.624 --> 20:36.726
Okay, yeah.

20:36.886 --> 20:45.382
And I know—we realize that if a donor wants to give things a certain place, you have to accept it, or you're going to lose it.

20:45.422 --> 20:46.884
So we understand that.

20:46.904 --> 20:52.294
So we'll have things that, sure, some will say they ought to be on it.

20:52.510 --> 20:56.634
Bill Brown would know that they shouldn't be at Harvard, because they wouldn't go anywhere, probably.

20:56.654 --> 20:57.916
But you better take them.

20:57.956 --> 21:00.078
They didn't accept them, so you take them.

21:00.098 --> 21:04.142
So we worked that, and the afternoon... Do you ever think of, do you work out deals in the long run, though?

21:04.182 --> 21:11.530
Maybe the afternoon has something that you like, and you have something that the afternoon might... If they're given, you can't do that.

21:12.411 --> 21:12.751
You can't.

21:13.111 --> 21:18.417
Look at that story over the Jewish Historical Society in Waltham.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.316
That's quite a story, isn't it?

21:20.356 --> 21:21.178
What story is that?

21:21.338 --> 21:23.501
Isn't that the Council of Friends?

21:23.521 --> 21:24.683
Catherine Mariah, that's what it is.

21:24.703 --> 21:25.645
Catherine?

21:25.665 --> 21:31.213
Yeah, C-A-C-H-A-R-I-M-A-R-I-A.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.515
Mariah, Mariah.

21:33.276 --> 21:34.959
What are her years?

21:34.999 --> 21:36.641
Does it happen?

21:37.142 --> 21:38.164
She is 1789, 1867.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.991
So she came well with it?

21:43.031 --> 21:47.458
You'll find her in the C-A-B.

21:47.624 --> 22:01.022
I can't recall the name of this document, but it was something that Rosenwald bought, and it was this horrible document, but it was old, and it was very precious in terms of scarcity.

22:01.923 --> 22:10.374
But it was about the trial of Jews considered them, which almost validated anti-Semitism.

22:10.615 --> 22:16.062
Rosenwald did not want this thing to fall into the hands of the Nazis, and so he commissioned Rosenwald to buy it,

22:16.598 --> 22:18.680
Council of Trent, something like that.

22:18.780 --> 22:20.802
Simon of Trent, some such type.

22:20.822 --> 22:22.424
He got it at auction in the 30s.

22:22.844 --> 22:25.587
Then he gave it to the Society and Wall Fair and said, keep it.

22:25.647 --> 22:26.168
I don't want it.

22:26.208 --> 22:28.350
I hate it, but I don't want it to fall into the wrong hand.

22:28.851 --> 22:38.561
Three years ago, something would be sold for $176,000 because they needed the money to pay the electricity out there, I guess.

22:38.981 --> 22:40.783
And I guess it finally wound up with yeshiva.

22:41.118 --> 22:42.039
in New York.

22:42.079 --> 22:49.310
But the point is, he gave them this with the understanding that they would keep it forever, and maybe they found a loophole and they went ahead and sold it.

22:49.330 --> 22:51.232
In any case, these things happen.

22:51.253 --> 22:56.961
Well, I think I can see some of that Grotten, I mean, telling them.

22:56.981 --> 22:59.384
Well, what does Grotten need it?

22:59.404 --> 23:03.390
Well, the Worcester Library sold the Stubbs stuff.

23:03.570 --> 23:04.031
Remember that?

23:04.532 --> 23:04.752
No.

23:04.772 --> 23:07.195
They had the Stubbs drawings, the anatomical drawings.

23:07.816 --> 23:08.357
Worcester Public?

23:08.472 --> 23:17.341
The Worcester Public Library found them in its basements about five years ago, and they were along to the Worcester Art Museum, and then no one bought it for Yale, like one and a half million dollars.

23:17.361 --> 23:19.644
And there was everyone saying, please go sell these things.

23:20.445 --> 23:22.267
No, you stay there.

23:22.287 --> 23:24.028
I just want to move through it.

23:24.909 --> 23:25.510
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:26.511 --> 23:26.791
Okay.

23:26.891 --> 23:30.035
I'd love to see whatever you, before you get in front.

23:31.737 --> 23:35.020
I don't want to antagonize any of those words.

23:35.793 --> 23:38.798
I've got till March of 91 to finish my book.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.003
I'm under contract to produce a manuscript by then.

23:42.604 --> 23:45.368
And what I will do is transcribe this stuff.

23:45.388 --> 23:47.151
And anything I use, I will show you.

23:47.211 --> 23:48.333
How about that?

23:48.633 --> 23:51.378
I commit myself to that without any reservations.

23:51.478 --> 23:53.321
I don't think there's anything else to do.

23:53.341 --> 23:53.842
No, no.

23:54.062 --> 23:58.048
You never know that sometimes people are very... I want everybody to be happy with what they say.

23:59.851 --> 24:03.657
We really haven't had anything confrontational with...

24:05.273 --> 24:11.220
Well, I think that this place is wonderful because it really is.

24:12.762 --> 24:23.235
One time, you know, it was just like a 5 o'clock already, and a lot of people couldn't get in, like moms and youth resources.

24:23.255 --> 24:33.407
And about the turn of the century, I guess we went into C4, one of the great members of the Ford family.

24:35.007 --> 24:46.205
said that they had to do something about allowing scholars and eventually they agreed that there can't be a closed place.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.892
What's the only great thing here?

24:49.912 --> 24:50.633
And that was done.

24:51.955 --> 24:54.719
And before long, there were complaints.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.905
Some of the members were complaining that they were just right.

24:58.125 --> 24:59.327
Was there opposition to it?

24:59.645 --> 25:07.493
Oh, that is normal, you know, whenever you try to change something, especially with older people, and most of our members are after being older.

25:07.513 --> 25:17.262
But then it went right through, and at first, I think there might have been some opposition to the club, you know, a very distinguished Boston town.

25:17.282 --> 25:23.769
I think one of the many features that distinguishes this society is the fact that you're a publishing society.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.230
Oh, well, we reduced that.

25:25.345 --> 25:27.788
Well, we're one of the great publishing societies.

25:28.008 --> 25:29.029
Just look at it.

25:29.049 --> 25:34.615
And on the other, this is all the original material published by us.

25:34.635 --> 25:38.019
In fact... I mean, it's not just a repository.

25:38.099 --> 25:39.040
We go the next step.

25:40.642 --> 25:49.452
Well, one of the stories I liked of Thoreau in his book on Cape Cod.

25:49.472 --> 25:54.998
Walking along the end under his arm, because there was...

25:55.248 --> 26:02.455
from the early days they used to get the cows, the cows, the cows, the oldest inhabitants, and so forth.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.477
So where is this?

26:04.517 --> 26:05.838
We're going to find this.

26:07.319 --> 26:08.841
That's a great little anecdote.

26:10.442 --> 26:13.045
Well, I think it's an essay on King Todd, you know.

26:13.405 --> 26:17.209
But I mean that he, the fact that he was walking along and he had the MHS?

26:17.649 --> 26:20.752
Yeah, that's how it happened.

26:20.772 --> 26:22.654
So we both had him.

26:22.674 --> 26:22.774
Yeah.

26:23.345 --> 26:27.089
Just wrap up a little bit on Jeremy Belknap, a little bit, if you could tell me.

26:27.669 --> 26:36.819
Do you feel, how do you feel being his successor, shall we say, carrying on in his, was he a great man in your view?

26:36.859 --> 26:39.201
Maybe give me some quotes on Jeremy Belknap.

26:39.221 --> 26:45.127
Well, I think, what you call a great man, I don't know.

26:45.147 --> 26:49.191
I mean, he was great at his business, I think.

26:49.211 --> 26:52.795
That's important to be very frank here.

26:53.753 --> 27:00.862
He was a minister up in Dover, New Hampshire, and he was having trouble with his parishioners.

27:00.882 --> 27:07.150
I guess he wasn't being paid or unknown, so it wasn't, it was all together to his likeness.

27:07.170 --> 27:08.392
And I think he was glad to get out of there.

27:09.273 --> 27:15.241
And when he came here, he came to the Federalist Church, he was a member of.

27:15.261 --> 27:23.271
And then he began to find people who, what he did about preservation of books, not only in a simple repository.

27:24.044 --> 27:28.553
And he had a friend in Philadelphia to read with him.

27:28.573 --> 27:33.703
But it was a time when this was going to happen anyway.

27:33.763 --> 27:36.429
Someone was going to start.

27:36.449 --> 27:42.842
The man in New York was very much interested in having a repository.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.006
So these people were writing back and forth these days.

27:45.239 --> 27:47.722
All of a sudden, say, hey, you've got a nation here.

27:47.962 --> 27:51.205
And that's just one of the reasons for it.

27:51.286 --> 27:52.507
Now we have to celebrate.

27:52.527 --> 27:53.728
We are a new nation.

27:53.748 --> 27:55.470
We've got to collect our materials.

27:55.490 --> 27:56.631
And this stuff is going to go.

27:57.492 --> 28:01.416
I mean, he had too many examples when he was writing this history, you see.

28:01.437 --> 28:03.639
He couldn't find the materials.

28:03.659 --> 28:07.543
But that's usually how it happened.

28:07.563 --> 28:08.364
I think I got that.

28:08.764 --> 28:11.768
There's so many of the things that just can disappear.

28:11.888 --> 28:13.930
And people use them.

28:15.074 --> 28:24.527
things and so forth, and had no central repository, where would you put them?

28:24.547 --> 28:31.236
I mean, Isaiah Thomas basically put together his collection because he was documenting the printing, the history of printing in North America.

28:31.256 --> 28:33.219
And he had to go out and get the materials.

28:33.259 --> 28:37.645
And when he got the materials, he said, hey, of course, by then he would have a place.

28:38.006 --> 28:41.250
I mean, it grows naturally, doesn't it?

28:41.433 --> 28:44.456
And, of course, he was very wealthy at that time.

28:44.476 --> 28:45.397
He was wealthy.

28:45.417 --> 28:48.800
Yeah, he was at Thomas in 1812 when he founded the AAS.

28:50.202 --> 28:55.267
Well, I think Bill Lapp was an interesting man, because we have his papers here.

28:55.287 --> 28:57.128
And we have to put him in perspective.

28:57.189 --> 28:59.611
He's not a great man in a sense.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.052
Well, he was a good historian.

29:01.313 --> 29:02.073
He was a good historian.

29:02.113 --> 29:03.034
He had good ideas.

29:03.174 --> 29:07.879
And he certainly had the right ideas about founding and his military.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.595
However, if he didn't do it, you're confident that somebody else would.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.336
Well, probably.

29:11.356 --> 29:15.460
It usually happens that way, don't you think?

29:15.560 --> 29:17.382
It had to happen.

29:17.402 --> 29:18.664
It has to be maintained.

29:18.744 --> 29:21.166
But this is the first one in the United States, isn't it?

29:21.186 --> 29:21.667
Yes, it is.

29:22.227 --> 29:23.989
So he was ahead of his time.

29:24.529 --> 29:33.098
And of course, I think the real thing that's so good about that time is people had things that they were willing to turn over.

29:34.059 --> 29:36.001
You know, there was a turn at the beginning.

29:36.021 --> 29:37.022
They were invited.

29:37.492 --> 29:38.333
and new members.

29:38.613 --> 29:39.154
And they did.

29:39.194 --> 29:39.775
There were lists.

29:39.875 --> 29:45.842
You'll find lists of things that were turned in by various new members.

29:46.142 --> 29:47.424
That was the start, you know.

29:49.606 --> 29:51.749
People who were present at the creation, so to speak.

29:51.769 --> 29:51.969
Right.

29:52.190 --> 30:02.622
And I think around 1821, a man turned in the Newburgh Congress, the Washington skylighting.

30:03.496 --> 30:04.377
What are your memories?

30:04.437 --> 30:06.059
It's an absolutely marvelous document.

30:06.079 --> 30:07.120
The last paragraph.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.924
Will I be able to find his identity in these papers?

30:11.005 --> 30:12.207
The fellow who turned this in?

30:12.787 --> 30:18.614
Well, it's right on... Okay.

30:19.055 --> 30:21.138
But it's the kind of thing I'd like to document.

30:21.158 --> 30:22.579
That's the kind of thing I'm looking for.

30:24.161 --> 30:25.563
It's a wonderful story.

30:25.583 --> 30:31.410
Well, the last paragraph is so moving.

30:31.778 --> 30:38.770
The last paragraph in his address, the Newberg address, to the soldiers.

30:38.890 --> 30:45.721
Remember, they were going to rebel because they had not been paid and so forth.

30:46.182 --> 30:50.169
It's just a wonderful document.

30:50.189 --> 30:55.558
Probably nobody even knew this document existed before the member gave it to you, right?

30:55.741 --> 31:04.372
Well, I think they knew about it because there was a great fuss about the whole business about they were going to be broke because they had not been paid and so forth, and that was quite... But I mean in terms of the actual document.

31:04.532 --> 31:04.772
No.

31:05.193 --> 31:07.055
This member who gave you the document.

31:07.075 --> 31:08.737
I don't even remember whether he was a member or not.

31:09.177 --> 31:10.219
That somebody just gave it?

31:10.239 --> 31:11.340
Somebody gave it, yes.

31:11.380 --> 31:14.444
Because his name is on the book plate.

31:14.464 --> 31:15.745
I can find out who he is.

31:15.865 --> 31:20.932
Well, I'll find out because I can... Now it's interesting you, isn't it?

31:20.952 --> 31:21.192
Yeah.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.516
Well, because I remember reading the last paragraph

31:25.559 --> 31:26.600
Of the address.

31:26.741 --> 31:28.884
Of the address to my friend, Walter Barrett.

31:29.485 --> 31:33.070
And my friend, in England, I'm a music boy.

31:33.090 --> 31:34.892
He was tough.

31:37.356 --> 31:40.320
He really was very moving back then.

31:40.340 --> 31:41.742
When did it come into the society?

31:42.263 --> 31:45.748
It's about that time.

31:45.768 --> 31:46.830
That's a wonderful story.

31:46.890 --> 31:47.891
I'm going to wrap up on that.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.755
You've given me two hours of your time.

31:51.056 --> 31:51.877
Just not quite.

31:52.057 --> 31:53.279
It was very enjoyable.

31:53.699 --> 31:54.621
I hope we do it again.

31:54.661 --> 31:55.482
I hope so.

31:55.900 --> 31:57.362
And I'm going to shut this off now.

31:58.544 --> 31:59.605
Do they say that again?

31:59.625 --> 31:59.866
I'm sorry.

31:59.926 --> 32:02.369
The sandwich is supposed to do really well.

32:04.793 --> 32:07.176
We may get two volumes out next year.

32:07.516 --> 32:10.300
This is on a diary of letters.

32:10.661 --> 32:13.184
No, not letters.

32:13.405 --> 32:16.229
And then I'll be through.

32:17.130 --> 32:19.153
I've done this often out for years and years.

32:20.174 --> 32:22.398
And then I guess they will continue.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.861
They think that there may be three more volumes sometime.

32:25.212 --> 32:26.694
Actually, it's a great movie.

32:26.714 --> 32:27.856
So you enjoy this?

32:28.396 --> 32:29.918
Well, I do it to a point.

32:29.958 --> 32:31.881
You know, after a while, I'll be working on it too long.

32:32.282 --> 32:39.491
Are you having trouble reading his trance, deciphering his... Yeah, well, his handwriting is very difficult.

32:39.511 --> 32:43.296
And of course, he blurs and blocks and everything else and crosses out.

32:44.198 --> 32:50.666
And then to see all these things... Is that the year there?

32:50.686 --> 32:54.231
17... 1751, maybe?

32:54.251 --> 32:54.932
51, yeah.

32:56.026 --> 33:01.354
This will be published by?

33:01.935 --> 33:02.035
Yeah.

33:02.055 --> 33:02.896
He was what, I'm sorry?

33:03.277 --> 33:10.227
Well, he is a sign of the Declaration.

33:10.247 --> 33:13.873
He was opposite John Adams in Boston, Nashville.

33:13.893 --> 33:14.113
Oh, really?

33:15.175 --> 33:19.181
And he was first attorney general in Massachusetts.

33:19.241 --> 33:20.503
Not insignificant.

33:20.903 --> 33:25.290
And he was from 1777 to 1790.

33:25.456 --> 33:55.378
uh the attorney general and get old business with uh taking properties and some of that this is uh from is that e.e cummings did you tell me that last time i was here so and then he went out of supreme judicial court and we have all those charges to the grand jury so it's a great subject and i think i've got the one that you can only get in the way of being dean of the boston college well that's kind of busy

33:56.354 --> 33:57.876
But it's RV E. Company, right?

33:58.156 --> 33:58.797
Yeah.

33:58.817 --> 34:01.600
Well, that's the kind of thing that doesn't really... And that's a Copley.

34:02.621 --> 34:03.402
That's a Copley.

34:03.422 --> 34:03.942
Yeah.

34:04.002 --> 34:04.823
Who's the subject?

34:04.843 --> 34:08.527
His name is Jackson.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.330
It is Jean-Jacques Rousseau by Quentin Latour.

34:11.370 --> 34:12.532
That's only a Copley.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.254
That's only a Copley.

34:15.114 --> 34:16.376
But this is a... That's his guard in there.

34:17.417 --> 34:19.319
That's an original Copley coil.

34:19.419 --> 34:19.980
Yeah, yeah.

34:20.040 --> 34:20.641
Not bad.

34:20.661 --> 34:22.162
I think it's past that one.

34:22.182 --> 34:22.883
Past that one.

34:22.903 --> 34:25.686
And that was the guy originally.

34:26.054 --> 34:28.237
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:28.878 --> 34:31.782
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:31.823 --> 34:33.245
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:33.345 --> 34:35.007
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:36.169 --> 34:36.770
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.434
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:39.534 --> 34:40.896
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:44.021 --> 34:45.022
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:46.364 --> 34:48.928
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:50.029 --> 34:51.371
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:51.532 --> 34:55.217
M-A-C-K-N-I-G-H-T.

34:56.851 --> 34:59.113
This is the... It's gorgeous.

34:59.173 --> 35:00.234
Look at the condition of that.

35:00.375 --> 35:01.095
It's fine, savage.

35:02.717 --> 35:04.459
We have the original plate.

35:04.959 --> 35:05.119
Uh-huh.

35:05.139 --> 35:06.661
This is pulled from the original plate?

35:09.404 --> 35:10.925
Spectacular.

35:10.945 --> 35:15.230
And this is somebody's grandfather's life.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.713
An old lady called me and asked me if I would want to come over this.

35:18.733 --> 35:22.057
She had some old furniture and she said, would you like this?

35:22.077 --> 35:22.437
No.

35:22.457 --> 35:23.338
It's wonderful.

35:23.498 --> 35:24.259
I don't think so.

35:26.534 --> 35:32.342
So you can't afford to pay for them, that's fine.

35:32.502 --> 35:32.983
Okay.

35:33.423 --> 35:34.124
We're in there.

35:34.144 --> 35:38.350
A member of the Society gave us this new collection.

35:38.370 --> 35:42.836
And we have taken out all the books that we've needed.

35:42.856 --> 35:45.600
And we have duplicate, so I call Sue Bauman.

35:45.620 --> 35:45.800
Oh.

35:46.381 --> 35:50.947
So she made a selection of all the books that they can have.

35:51.568 --> 35:55.714
And these, I think, are not just a little bit far.

35:57.247 --> 35:59.169
The D.O.W.S.E.

35:59.209 --> 36:00.230
Library, the D.O.W.S.E.

36:00.250 --> 36:14.385
Library, which came... It came, uh, oh, let me see.

36:15.546 --> 36:17.248
Uh, no, it's the date that I can't have.

36:17.268 --> 36:21.212
It's an account of a little bit of some time in your mind.

36:21.232 --> 36:21.473
Okay.

36:23.054 --> 36:24.316
But again, this was a gift.

36:24.476 --> 36:24.756
A library...

36:26.778 --> 36:56.447
I'm sorry, I just got stopped when I see these things.

36:58.672 --> 37:10.825
This is not from that collection, this is a statue.

37:30.194 --> 37:34.921
Oh, my.

37:37.585 --> 37:41.672
Oh, isn't this extraordinary?

37:41.772 --> 37:44.776
That's the one of the English people from Boston.

37:45.217 --> 37:45.317
Yeah.

37:45.337 --> 37:47.941
I think it's the one.

37:48.021 --> 37:48.262
Yeah.

37:48.342 --> 37:49.023
What is it?

37:49.043 --> 37:51.887
Christian Riddick did the watercolor.

37:51.907 --> 37:52.108
Uh-huh.

37:52.128 --> 37:54.491
So that's the original watercolor.

37:54.511 --> 37:55.353
That's the original watercolor.

37:55.373 --> 37:58.758
And we have another copy there, a smaller copy.

37:58.778 --> 37:58.918
Uh-huh.

38:00.653 --> 38:28.382
oh my this is the council room this is these books are extraordinary bindings are they who is this again these are the distance

38:30.337 --> 38:31.518
These were all his books?

38:33.361 --> 38:34.943
Yeah.

38:40.329 --> 38:46.176
There is some kind of a, you have some kind of a catalog of this available at some point, that I might be able to.

38:46.196 --> 38:50.421
This is the kind of thing I'm looking for.

38:50.441 --> 38:52.444
How many volumes?

38:52.464 --> 38:56.749
There must be three or four thousand volumes there, I would say.

38:57.049 --> 39:00.073
Some of the very rare drinking items are in there, too.

39:00.239 --> 39:03.362
Any literary things?

39:03.442 --> 39:04.223
Oh, yeah.

39:04.343 --> 39:05.585
There's Byron's works.

39:06.386 --> 39:10.610
There's Hallowell's Life and Shakespeare.

39:10.750 --> 39:13.954
Now, did you think he bound all of these himself?

39:13.994 --> 39:17.818
No, I think he probably was very selective.

39:18.038 --> 39:25.766
He was one of the great villains.

39:26.167 --> 39:26.627
He was?

39:26.727 --> 39:27.308
No.

39:28.890 --> 39:29.250
He has

39:29.585 --> 39:32.969
Oh, I see.

39:32.989 --> 39:37.614
He was the... And that is he?

39:37.654 --> 39:38.175
That's he.

39:38.696 --> 39:39.877
Who did the portrait?

39:40.177 --> 39:43.401
Do you know offhand?

39:43.741 --> 39:44.462
No, I don't.

39:44.602 --> 39:45.083
That's all right.

39:45.484 --> 39:55.956
I thought it might be somebody dazzling like, you know, Copley or... These busts are just busts.

39:57.638 --> 39:57.938
Yeah.

39:58.880 --> 40:05.150
Sir Walter Scott by Sir Francis Liggett Chantry.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.937
Yeah, that's very well-known, this one.

40:09.957 --> 40:14.264
Robert Charles Winthrop, sixth president, by Powers.

40:14.524 --> 40:20.513
Aaron Powers, the one of the famous American school.

40:20.533 --> 40:26.102
That one is another one, it's one of the Peabody's, which is the main Peabody Institute and Peabody and so forth.

40:28.411 --> 40:34.277
These plastics are going to go.

40:34.297 --> 40:44.786
This must be one of the high spots of the collection, I would say, in terms of eye appeal, you know, the permanency of this.

40:44.947 --> 40:46.528
A recent gift.

40:48.390 --> 40:53.034
You're talking about the piece of furniture?

40:54.896 --> 40:55.937
Yes.

40:56.390 --> 40:58.512
Do you think the society would be interested in this?

40:58.533 --> 40:59.614
Oh, okay, yes.

40:59.634 --> 41:02.978
And I thought I surely would be.

41:02.998 --> 41:06.642
And then he had it appraised, and he said, hey, about a million dollars, maybe?

41:08.064 --> 41:08.544
I don't know.

41:08.624 --> 41:10.086
I never knew, but at least they're aware.

41:10.306 --> 41:11.828
At least would these things go far enough.

41:11.948 --> 41:15.152
And it was appraised by the great appraiser in New York.

41:16.153 --> 41:21.860
And so I wonder a little bit, well, maybe he won't be able to afford to give it to us.

41:22.060 --> 41:22.821
And he did.

41:22.841 --> 41:24.523
And he was first out of there as well.

41:25.195 --> 41:27.238
It was done by a child's child.

41:27.798 --> 41:34.887
And it was a fifth generation of family drawing.

41:34.907 --> 41:35.688
It's wonderful.

41:36.549 --> 41:38.051
Maybe that's one reproduction.

41:38.071 --> 41:40.735
That is a reproduction.

41:41.075 --> 41:42.857
Pretty good eye.

41:43.178 --> 41:48.905
And this was along the child somewhere.

41:48.925 --> 41:49.966
This desk.

41:50.206 --> 41:54.612
That was a chair in which he sat and was a cane by Christian Brooks.

41:54.997 --> 41:59.842
When he was what by Preston Woods?

41:59.862 --> 42:00.863
When he was what?

42:00.883 --> 42:01.704
You said when he was what?

42:02.245 --> 42:09.733
Well, he came out in one of his great, child's son, great operations against slavery.

42:09.953 --> 42:19.503
And he spoke badly of the senator, a certain senator, his nephew.

42:19.523 --> 42:21.105
He was so angry he came in.

42:21.659 --> 42:28.712
Sumner was a tall man who was sitting there and he'd find Rodell's and he'd feed him over there with a cane.

42:28.732 --> 42:29.794
He shattered the cane.

42:30.014 --> 42:30.335
Wow.

42:30.495 --> 42:34.762
Sumner couldn't get up because he was tied to the floor and he sprung and wrenched it out.

42:34.782 --> 42:36.926
He had to retire from the summit for 70 years.

42:36.946 --> 42:37.307
Really?

42:37.327 --> 42:37.427
Yeah.

42:38.269 --> 42:39.511
That's funny, is it?

42:39.531 --> 42:39.952
Look at that.

42:39.972 --> 42:41.915
It's wonderful.

42:41.935 --> 42:46.283
This is one of the features of the Museum of Fine Arts Show.

42:46.600 --> 43:15.342
bicentennial exhibition what do we call this room that we're in here does it work at the hamilton room used to sit here and those are early portraits of the winters who never came to this country but their name certainly resonates doesn't it well this place is wonderful what a feeling to well it's a lovely place and one of our members

43:16.030 --> 43:21.717
He did all the great painting.

43:21.737 --> 43:25.481
He's an artist.

43:25.501 --> 43:28.225
He did all the fine things.

43:28.245 --> 43:29.066
He did some of our painting.

43:29.086 --> 43:35.634
And he said, never let him assuage you to move from this thing.

43:35.654 --> 43:40.339
He said, you'll never make this.

43:40.359 --> 43:40.840
It's all an English oak.

43:43.064 --> 43:47.949
This is where you have your exhibits, this little one.

43:47.969 --> 43:48.449
This little one, yeah.

43:48.490 --> 43:51.713
So we're doing photography here, I guess.

43:51.733 --> 43:57.178
Beautiful.

44:01.543 --> 44:02.264
Southwest Native.

44:02.284 --> 44:03.965
Southwest Native, yeah.

44:03.985 --> 44:07.109
Two platinum photographs.

44:07.609 --> 44:12.514
Just coincidental, over at Houghton Library, they have some Sir Thomas Phillips photographs.

44:12.730 --> 44:15.253
which were being displayed.

44:15.633 --> 44:16.955
It came out of his collection.

44:17.415 --> 44:18.797
Nobody even knew he had it.

44:18.897 --> 44:20.379
In fact, Hornblatt, I guess, bought them.

44:20.859 --> 44:22.921
A sight unseen.

44:23.402 --> 44:26.686
Harrison Hornblatt.

44:27.406 --> 44:30.450
He bought them and gave them to the whole room and the library.

44:30.470 --> 44:34.314
Well, it's nice when you have people with kids.

44:34.334 --> 44:34.975
Look up there.

44:34.995 --> 44:36.156
A handsome old cannibal.

44:36.697 --> 44:42.383
Alvin would put it out by the narrative.

44:43.409 --> 44:48.816
I'm going to get back to Worcester, but I cannot thank you enough for the time that you've given me today.

44:49.157 --> 44:49.878
And we'll do it again.

44:49.918 --> 44:54.283
Again, I'm now looking at the pastels.

44:54.404 --> 44:56.306
The famous, that's Blight.

44:56.386 --> 44:58.109
That's how you pronounce that?

44:58.129 --> 45:02.915
Benjamin Blight of John and Abigail Adams.

45:03.215 --> 45:06.179
1676.

45:06.299 --> 45:09.984
Which are probably some of the oldest portraits in North America.

45:10.004 --> 45:10.605
They are.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.808
They were sort of...

45:13.649 --> 45:18.454
that this man, she was Mrs. Baker.

45:18.554 --> 45:20.256
Mrs. Baker, mother of Nicholas.

45:20.276 --> 45:21.637
Mother, yeah, mother of Nicholas.

45:22.438 --> 45:24.180
And this is her brother.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.183
Look at the date, 1675, that's when that portrait was done.

45:27.203 --> 45:31.508
And I have the letter of transmittal, and it's in 1676.

45:32.208 --> 45:33.450
He was writing to St.

45:33.610 --> 45:36.873
Louis Trump, who owned Nava's Island.

45:37.133 --> 45:41.158
He knows to be controlled.

45:41.178 --> 45:43.420
And he said, I am simply the portrait, of course.

45:43.822 --> 45:50.310
This is Samuel Shunshun, Elizabeth Baker, and Married to that man.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.494
So these all kind of came in one lock.

45:53.814 --> 45:54.956
That is not an original.

45:55.196 --> 45:56.177
That is a copy.

45:56.337 --> 45:56.978
Just this one?

45:57.138 --> 45:59.681
Yeah, because the original's in here.

45:59.701 --> 46:00.943
That's Catherine Roberts.

46:00.983 --> 46:05.428
They were sending her shade across.

46:06.169 --> 46:07.170
One, two, three.

46:07.491 --> 46:08.752
We have four portraits.

46:08.893 --> 46:11.736
And then the same family gave us this chance.

46:12.593 --> 46:18.582
which every year we have a contention from winter to winter, which is probably done in the 1680s.

46:19.663 --> 46:20.825
It's called a court.

46:20.845 --> 46:21.025
1680.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.187
It's called the what?

46:22.347 --> 46:22.688
Court.

46:23.309 --> 46:24.550
A court, or B court?

46:24.630 --> 46:27.995
A, yeah.

46:28.536 --> 46:33.303
And the portrait of Mrs. Baker hangs over it.

46:34.725 --> 46:37.028
It looks like she's a 17th century woman.

46:37.068 --> 46:39.512
Yes, she was an Iron Man.

46:44.167 --> 46:47.150
Same picture, I suppose.

46:47.170 --> 46:51.655
That is the first sailing painting down here.

46:52.196 --> 46:56.380
That's the ship Beth Bell, two of you, is probably printed, probably painted in England, 1748.

46:56.540 --> 46:59.944
No, I thought it was done here, I guess.

46:59.964 --> 47:07.032
Well, I mean, that's what it says there, but they probably know.

47:07.052 --> 47:07.672
Right out in the cold, are you?

47:07.752 --> 47:08.433
Now we're in another.

47:09.935 --> 47:12.958
We call it a river.

47:13.833 --> 47:21.180
The inner sanctum, everything's rare here.

47:21.200 --> 47:28.406
That was a silk flag given by John Hancock, who covered originally during the Revolution.

47:28.426 --> 47:30.008
Which is that piece of theory.

47:30.028 --> 47:30.749
That's a huge thing.

47:31.109 --> 47:34.972
And they found about, and I said, Angelica, I don't think I could stand them.

47:34.992 --> 47:36.934
They said, put it, and send it down, and we'll take care of it.

47:37.595 --> 47:38.255
Put it in good shape.

47:38.275 --> 47:38.636
They did.

47:39.376 --> 47:40.177
And who is this he said?

47:40.197 --> 47:41.038
National portrait gallery.

47:47.549 --> 47:49.732
Look at this stuff.

47:49.752 --> 47:52.935
Is this the room where you showed me the Mather, the unpublished Mather?

47:53.055 --> 47:53.636
See, I remember.

47:53.937 --> 47:55.098
Yeah.

47:55.118 --> 48:03.067
No, that's a, that's a, uh... You said that awaits somebody who has the, who has the, who has the... Oh, yeah.

48:03.087 --> 48:03.608
That's a manuscript.

48:03.628 --> 48:04.489
That's a manuscript.

48:04.509 --> 48:05.390
These are books.

48:05.410 --> 48:05.991
I'm sorry.

48:06.011 --> 48:07.633
These are all books.

48:07.913 --> 48:08.093
Yeah.

48:08.914 --> 48:14.160
And these newspapers, the first, the last newsletter, the first one to be continuously printed.

48:14.180 --> 48:15.582
Is it?

48:16.220 --> 48:22.248
Just here on the wall on the corner.

48:22.288 --> 48:33.623
You know where everything is, don't you, huh?

48:34.324 --> 48:37.128
I love a little chair here on the corner.

48:37.148 --> 48:42.615
Little alcoves.

48:44.840 --> 48:51.409
You have books of hours?

48:51.609 --> 48:55.094
Well, we have several.

48:55.114 --> 48:59.500
Twenty years ago, it seems not worth very much.

48:59.521 --> 49:00.061
It changed.

49:00.862 --> 49:01.583
It's changed.

49:01.603 --> 49:06.350
Everything's worth something.

49:06.370 --> 49:09.935
Diary of a Clues from China and Japan.

49:12.058 --> 49:13.480
George Kennan.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.489
George Henry Pebble.

49:16.909 --> 49:17.129
Pebble.

49:17.450 --> 49:17.690
Oh, Pebble.

49:17.750 --> 49:19.953
He's in the shipping family.

49:19.973 --> 49:20.813
Pebble is very famous.

49:20.934 --> 49:22.175
Mr. Robert Haswell.

49:22.776 --> 49:27.801
Columbia is the first person to go around the way of the bus.

49:27.821 --> 49:32.386
And they started with... Just find these things here on the shelves.

49:32.446 --> 49:35.209
Well, they get these here, actually.

49:35.229 --> 49:41.416
Ah, yeah, these are other.

49:41.436 --> 49:41.796
Cincinnati's here.

49:43.227 --> 49:48.054
It's all part of the breadth of the collection, you know, and the depth, I guess.

49:48.074 --> 49:50.137
Well, okay.

49:50.157 --> 49:53.241
We're over here.

49:53.562 --> 49:54.904
I almost am.

49:54.924 --> 49:57.608
What a place.

49:57.628 --> 50:03.777
That's gorgeous.

50:04.958 --> 50:05.219
I'm sorry.

50:05.239 --> 50:08.704
The harbor at Hong Kong about 1850.

50:08.724 --> 50:11.648
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

50:12.438 --> 50:15.201
I've been to Hong Kong when I was here.

50:15.221 --> 50:15.341
Yeah.

50:15.361 --> 50:17.944
Because, you know, I went to work overnight, I guess.

50:17.964 --> 50:18.405
For a couple of weeks.

50:18.425 --> 50:19.266
Yeah, that's very long.

50:19.326 --> 50:19.766
Well, several.

50:19.906 --> 50:22.829
I was, it was the end of the course that I had.

50:22.970 --> 50:31.479
I wasn't like, we had the things I saw there.

50:31.499 --> 50:33.261
Dorothy Q, the Holmes poem.

50:33.421 --> 50:35.423
Oliver Wendell Holmes is the artist unknown.

50:35.764 --> 50:40.389
But that's the portrait of Dorothy Quincy Jackson, 1776.

50:40.429 --> 50:42.411
The gift of Oliver Wendell Holmes.

50:43.657 --> 50:49.695
I'm just talking right outside the second floor elevator.

50:50.798 --> 50:51.320
There she is.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.088
That's a famous poem.
