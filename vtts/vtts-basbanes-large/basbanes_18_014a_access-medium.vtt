WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:04.408
Okay, the tape recorder is now on.

00:04.488 --> 00:04.788
Okay.

00:04.848 --> 00:10.475
I became interested in medical history, oh, close to, really close to 30 years ago.

00:11.115 --> 00:16.422
And I began buying books that would help me as secondary sources.

00:16.642 --> 00:20.366
Well, I ended up buying books that helped me as primary sources.

00:20.466 --> 00:25.532
Basically, my only criterion for buying a book is do I want to read it?

00:25.512 --> 00:45.529
I'm not someone who feels he wants to own it necessarily because I've got the wonderful Yale Medical Library and I can hold in my hand a 1628 edition of Harvey's De Motu Cordes anytime I want to, but my purpose in buying is to learn about medical history.

00:46.100 --> 01:13.086
at the big buying phase for a very long time and we have had to our house is like a yeast it's butted out because we've had to build other parts in order to hold the books and the stuff that go along with it but unlike you my wife isn't a collector and so we have these interesting conversations about books and every once in a while she puts me on a moratorium so i can't buy any

01:13.792 --> 01:14.693
It happens, though.

01:14.893 --> 01:19.880
And I wouldn't say my wife is a collector, but she does share the passion for the books.

01:19.900 --> 01:26.188
And we'll see something, and we know it's extravagant, and there's no way we can justify buying it.

01:27.089 --> 01:30.694
But it will be beautiful, and it will be something that we both want.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.897
Let me just say that...

01:32.877 --> 01:39.887
What person I did interview at length and visited him was Dr. Haskell Norman out in San Francisco.

01:39.907 --> 01:40.828
Do you know him?

01:41.048 --> 01:41.729
Oh, I know him.

01:41.829 --> 01:43.331
His son is a friend of mine.

01:43.612 --> 01:44.112
Jeremy.

01:45.054 --> 01:54.767
Yeah, well, we interviewed him at length, and he began getting books the same way that you did, things that he thought could help him with his work.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.289
And then, of course, it goes beyond.

01:56.309 --> 02:04.097
Then you have to have the, you know, the primary documents and the great books.

02:04.437 --> 02:07.120
He's got an absolutely extraordinary collection.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.384
Well, you know about this thing he did with the Grolier Society last year.

02:11.444 --> 02:23.877
He had a man named Bill Helfand, who was a former vice president of Mark Sharp and Dome, collects in pharmacology and pharmacy, set up an exhibit for the Grolier Society of the hundred most important books.

02:24.194 --> 02:48.852
historic medical books and that uh you know obviously haskell norman was the perfect person to do that kind of yeah looking at his catalog right here of the of that exhibition oh you have it yeah that was wonderful anyway let's talk about this this marvelous book i have to say it's a and i i have your first book here too or your earlier book doctors the biography of medicine

02:49.253 --> 02:53.281
And I was going to bring them both along today and have you describe them all.

02:53.301 --> 02:54.043
Well, we'll do it.

02:54.223 --> 02:57.430
By the way, let me also say that Yale plays a very prominent part of my book.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.839
Betsy Shirley, four-timer, is in my book.

03:02.761 --> 03:05.487
You know, I've spent quite a bit of time at Yale.

03:05.547 --> 03:07.391
I love the Beinecke, I have to say.

03:07.411 --> 03:08.393
It's just...

03:08.373 --> 03:09.576
A magnificent place.

03:10.097 --> 03:11.922
House built with green stamps.

03:12.102 --> 03:13.406
That's absolutely correct.

03:13.526 --> 03:21.606
In fact, my wife and I went to visit Betsy Beinecke Shirley out in New Jersey, whose great collection of children's books is now on its way to Yale.

03:22.413 --> 03:29.362
she started collecting in midlife to compete with her husband who was making Kentucky rifles.

03:30.624 --> 03:35.430
Anyway, let's talk about the decision to do this book.

03:37.273 --> 03:45.644
Clearly the book speaks for itself, and there's no reason to have to ask you to repeat some of the things that you say quite eloquently in the book.

03:45.664 --> 03:50.530
But tell me about the conviction that such an approach was necessary.

03:50.510 --> 03:55.227
Well, Nick, you're going to understand what I'm about to say better than anybody.

03:55.528 --> 04:00.064
I was having office hours one day in September of 19.

04:00.348 --> 04:08.017
It was late in the day, and I had a couple of long cases in the morning, and I was very tired and seeing about my umpteen patient.

04:08.497 --> 04:23.875
It must have been about 5 or 5.30, and the phone rang, and a man on the other end said, My name is Glenn Hartley, and you have no name, but I have an idea for a book, and I've been speaking to editors in New York, and your name has been given to me as someone

04:23.855 --> 04:25.537
who should write this book.

04:25.657 --> 04:31.304
And that was because of doctors and that article I had done in the New Yorker on heart transplantation.

04:32.025 --> 04:43.480
And he told me, uh, what he really wanted, which was a description of clinical aspects of death made so that the good general reader would understand it.

04:43.780 --> 04:44.882
And I said, Ms.

04:44.922 --> 04:46.003
Tarley, I can't do that.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.606
I'm working on a book on disease right now.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.191
And I had gotten through the first chapter and I have an agent anyway.

04:52.511 --> 04:53.052
And, uh,

04:53.538 --> 04:54.759
I just don't want to do this.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.141
He said, well, think about it.

04:56.221 --> 04:57.082
Take my number.

04:57.903 --> 05:07.214
I went home, and as I was driving home, and it's only 10 minutes, you know how small New Haven is, I thought, my God, who better to write this book?

05:07.234 --> 05:11.840
My mother died when I was a week after my 11th birthday.

05:12.481 --> 05:18.368
I was brought up by an aunt and a grandmother, and by the time I was in my mid-20s, they had both died.

05:18.408 --> 05:23.494
I have had more personal experience with death

05:24.217 --> 05:26.960
than virtually anyone I know.

05:26.981 --> 05:32.828
And here I was in a career where so many of my patients had malignant and lethal diseases.

05:32.968 --> 05:37.934
And I realized as I looked back on the volunteer things I had done, what had I done?

05:37.954 --> 05:40.638
I had volunteered my time with hospice.

05:40.698 --> 05:43.862
I'd actually had one year been vice president of hospice.

05:43.842 --> 05:50.831
For about a dozen years, I had been on the medical board of a charitable home for the aged in New Haven.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.155
I'd been chairman of their medical committee for a couple of years.

05:55.316 --> 06:01.704
Other voluntary things I had done during my career always had to do with things at the end of life.

06:01.985 --> 06:07.892
And I quite recognized, and had recognized for some long time, that my fascination with medicine,

06:08.159 --> 06:20.138
whether subconscious or otherwise, had to do with my need to get some grip on this thing that had taken off members of my family, you know, in essence to control nature.

06:21.019 --> 06:26.187
And you don't have to be much of a psychoanalyst to appreciate what was going on in my head.

06:27.049 --> 06:29.593
So I thought, gee, that guy is right.

06:29.913 --> 06:30.654
I ought to meet him.

06:31.656 --> 06:32.457
So I met him.

06:32.477 --> 06:34.200
And you know what Glenn and Glenn are like.

06:34.703 --> 06:36.726
They fascinated me from the start.

06:36.746 --> 06:46.843
In the first place, they reminded me of my daughter, who's 32, and her husband, the same aggressive intellect, the same certainty of how good they are.

06:47.664 --> 06:51.691
So I signed on to do it, and Glenn said, okay, now write a proposal.

06:51.731 --> 06:59.243
And I was so taken by the subject that that morning I woke up at 3 in the morning and wrote the proposal.

06:59.830 --> 07:04.938
And Glenn looked at it and said, well, that's fine, but you need to tell me about a patient.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.743
And so I added the story of that man, McCarty.

07:08.864 --> 07:10.767
And once I did that, I was hooked.

07:10.948 --> 07:22.446
I realized then that the only way I could do justice to this topic was to describe my own, and I can only call it pilgrimage, with death throughout my life.

07:23.236 --> 07:49.969
And although originally when I told Glenn I would do it, I had made a conscious decision not to talk about personal things, by that time I understood that the only way I could make sense to other people, to give other people a sense of identification with what I had learned, was to get them to allow them to identify with specific people that I knew, whether they were my patients or members of my family,

07:50.438 --> 07:55.044
who had died whose deaths I had witnessed and attended, actually.

07:55.945 --> 07:57.226
So it became a mission.

07:57.407 --> 07:59.089
It really became a mission.

08:00.230 --> 08:05.096
And the book was written almost by free associating.

08:06.177 --> 08:07.599
You know, I would get up every morning.

08:07.619 --> 08:09.822
I usually start working at about 8.15.

08:10.362 --> 08:13.566
Sometimes I read what I wrote the day before, but I usually didn't.

08:14.187 --> 08:15.328
And I would just start writing.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.391
I never had an outline.

08:17.557 --> 08:18.780
I never had a plan.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.611
I never on any given day knew what I was going to write until I sat down.

08:23.792 --> 08:24.694
It was astonishing.

08:24.714 --> 08:27.019
Do you remember those old Ouija boards?

08:27.039 --> 08:29.926
It was like having your fingers on a Ouija board.

08:29.966 --> 08:32.953
And I kept making that analogy all through the writing of the book.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.381
The last three chapters just rolled off the end of the pencil.

08:36.441 --> 08:36.882
I did it.

08:37.553 --> 08:38.934
a 2.5 pencil.

08:38.954 --> 08:39.475
Oh, you did?

08:39.835 --> 08:42.278
Yeah, yeah.

08:42.498 --> 08:45.341
This is not a word-processed book, as we say.

08:45.742 --> 09:01.639
Well, what I do is, the way I do it is I write it, and then when I finish the chapter, I go back and I decide I like another word better than the word I'm using, where I put the clauses front to back in a particular sentence, but that's it.

09:01.759 --> 09:04.962
And then I type it onto the computer, and that's my final revision.

09:05.228 --> 09:05.929
Really?

09:05.949 --> 09:07.632
And that's a minor revision.

09:07.652 --> 09:08.233
And there it is.

09:08.494 --> 09:09.415
It just reads.

09:09.455 --> 09:15.005
It really is such a structured book because you really have covered the major causes.

09:15.045 --> 09:25.923
I mean, you really had a clear thought here that, I mean, I'm going to write something that is going to touch everybody, at least in one place, I guess.

09:26.544 --> 09:28.688
But isn't it amazing to...

09:28.668 --> 09:37.040
I hope it's a little bit as amazing to you as it is to me to realize that this guy who wrote this thing didn't know what he was doing from day to day.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.442
Well, I think you did.

09:38.462 --> 09:39.524
Because you know what?

09:39.564 --> 09:42.147
You've been living this your entire adult life.

09:42.448 --> 09:43.429
Your whole life, really.

09:43.469 --> 09:46.614
I mean, you talk about your grandmother dying when you were 11.

09:46.674 --> 09:48.256
I mean, so your mother, I'm sorry.

09:48.316 --> 09:52.262
And then, of course, you describe your grandmother later.

09:52.563 --> 10:17.052
uh and you you've been alert to this your entire life this book is this book really has been has been building i think through forever i mean for as long as that's that's the point i'm a great believer in the power of the subconscious mind many years ago i lived back to back with a yale professor who backyard to backyard who was a great scholar in a very esoteric area

10:17.487 --> 10:25.939
And I asked him one day what was his secret, because he was one of these people who didn't produce a lot, but when he did, everybody in the field would rush to read it.

10:25.999 --> 10:26.960
He said it's very simple.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.624
He said, I never force the material.

10:29.904 --> 10:32.107
I let the material come to me.

10:32.127 --> 10:37.174
He said he studies everything he can about a topic and then just starts writing about it.

10:37.835 --> 10:46.026
And that's what I would do, you know, when I wanted to write about AIDS, for example, which was not a disease I had treated much of as a surgeon.

10:46.580 --> 10:52.347
I simply went to the director of the AIDS unit and said, I want to go with your team.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.688
And I would make rounds with them.

10:53.748 --> 10:55.230
I would go to conferences with them.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.533
I would read everything I could about AIDS.

10:57.553 --> 11:03.139
And I just didn't even make any attempt to write for weeks and weeks and weeks.

11:03.319 --> 11:06.843
And then one day it occurred to me how I wanted to do it.

11:06.903 --> 11:08.746
And I just sat down and wrote it.

11:08.766 --> 11:13.050
I wrote that chapter in about a week, the first AIDS chapter and the second AIDS chapter.

11:13.691 --> 11:15.253
I went up to visit a friend.

11:15.723 --> 11:19.452
I remember how to tell that story, came back, and then just wrote the chapter.

11:19.572 --> 11:29.715
So it's a combination of a life's percolating plus the material, the new material, the new science material, as in AIDS and Alzheimer's,

11:29.999 --> 11:32.702
which are both things I didn't know a lot about.

11:32.722 --> 11:38.187
The Alzheimer's section, that friend, I mean this proud man.

11:38.768 --> 11:40.790
My wife worked with an Alzheimer's project.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.912
She's a medical social worker.

11:43.733 --> 11:54.443
Worked with a research project being done by Cornell and really focuses on the caregivers, the people who live with this on a day-by-day basis.

11:55.244 --> 11:57.026
And so a lot of this stuff was very familiar.

11:57.046 --> 11:59.128
And just the agony of seeing somebody that

11:59.632 --> 12:02.755
You have the greatest respect for her and the greatest love for her.

12:03.215 --> 12:14.706
And when you describe this poor man totally incontinent and his wife saying, I mean, he would be the most embarrassed person in the world had he known.

12:15.226 --> 12:17.829
And these families, of course, never recover.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.631
They never recover financially.

12:21.552 --> 12:27.057
This family was totally wiped down by the man's name.

12:27.762 --> 12:37.158
Actually, it was Lou Pollock, and Lou had made a lot of money in commercial real estate, and his widow was left with barely enough to subsist on.

12:37.218 --> 12:37.759
I see her.

12:38.199 --> 12:40.824
I spoke to her on the phone a couple of weeks ago.

12:40.884 --> 12:48.657
I see her once or twice a year, and she's getting by okay because they had a condo down in Florida.

12:49.092 --> 12:51.176
But that's about it.

12:51.617 --> 12:52.619
It's terrible, isn't it?

12:52.720 --> 12:56.588
The whole life should be directed towards this.

12:57.069 --> 13:05.025
I mean, it should be focused towards this ultimate indignity, I guess.

13:06.541 --> 13:09.829
You wonder, you know, what can you do about it?

13:10.069 --> 13:17.808
Then you have that heart-wrenching scene about the little girl who's hacked.

13:18.009 --> 13:24.043
Tell me why now bringing that particular... This is not natural death in any way, is it?

13:24.884 --> 13:27.668
But then again, it's a primary cause of death, isn't it?

13:27.688 --> 13:29.350
It's a very common cause of death.

13:29.450 --> 13:41.606
And as you probably know, it's probably one of the leading causes of death in the particular age group, 15 to 24, when the two leading causes of death in the age has sort of moved in.

13:41.887 --> 13:47.494
And in our violent society, especially in big cities, I don't know how things are in Worcester these days.

13:47.715 --> 13:48.155
Terrible.

13:48.335 --> 13:50.398
We have a huge homicide rate.

13:50.418 --> 13:53.963
You know, per capita, New Haven has the second highest homicide rate in the

13:54.230 --> 13:55.372
Well, it scares me.

13:55.432 --> 13:59.618
I'd love to send my daughters to Yale, for instance, but you have to think about it, don't you?

13:59.798 --> 14:00.880
Yale is safe.

14:01.561 --> 14:12.838
Believe me, the city, all of these things occur among a particular group of kids in New Haven, and they don't kill anybody but each other.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.282
My son went to Yale.

14:15.362 --> 14:19.428
He graduated, of course, in 86, but I know a number of Yale undergraduates.

14:19.488 --> 14:21.311
I'm a fellow at one of the Yale colleges.

14:21.852 --> 14:23.494
That is not a consideration.

14:23.812 --> 14:32.584
If your girls want to go and you think it's appropriate for whatever financial reason or whatever, don't think anything about safety.

14:32.624 --> 14:36.229
There have been some pretty bad cases, though, I know, in the last couple.

14:36.249 --> 14:39.614
There have been a couple of cases involving students.

14:40.175 --> 14:41.837
Very, very few.

14:42.121 --> 14:52.442
About two years ago, the Yale Weekly Bulletin decided as a public service it was going to publish every single incident that the Yale police became involved in.

14:53.324 --> 14:55.548
And I read them religiously every week.

14:55.749 --> 14:59.637
There are very, very... Well, that's reassuring, isn't it?

14:59.657 --> 15:00.298
...involving students.

15:00.683 --> 15:06.929
I have a daughter, an older daughter, who goes to Worcester Academy here in Worcester, and it's a wonderful old school.

15:07.230 --> 15:08.431
But, you know, it's in a pocket.

15:08.471 --> 15:14.858
It's up on a hill, and you go outside the walls, and it's two entirely different communities.

15:14.878 --> 15:15.879
And this happens.

15:15.979 --> 15:26.710
I'm the president of the Friends of the Goddard Library at Clark University, which was in a part of the city, which was once, you know, an elegant part of town, and now it's South Main.

15:26.730 --> 15:28.632
You know, I mean, it's surrounded by the...

15:29.033 --> 15:31.742
by the drug cap of central New England.

15:31.762 --> 15:36.297
I mean, there's no way you can insure anything anymore.

15:36.638 --> 15:39.347
But, I mean, being safe, I guess.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.882
Let's see.

15:43.743 --> 15:47.228
You mentioned on page 86, we should be replaced.

15:47.849 --> 16:02.632
I mean, this thirst that people have to live forever, this thirst for immortality and this hope that there will be a controlling of the aging process.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.835
First of all, you don't think that's possible.

16:04.915 --> 16:07.299
And number two, you don't think it's a good idea.

16:07.639 --> 16:09.402
I think it's a very bad idea.

16:09.837 --> 16:28.909
You know, when you're in a profession like I am, where young people are being trained all the time, you watch the development of young men and women who come in at the age of 21 or so, and they don't leave until they're after 30, and you see the evolution of their excitement.

16:29.345 --> 16:41.098
And the things that they begin to contribute that their seniors would never dream of, you recognize the absolute necessity to renew the world with every generation.

16:41.119 --> 16:51.150
That if we were to continue doing things the way we did them into our 60s, our 70s, our 80s, our 90s, our 100s, the world would never change.

16:51.603 --> 16:53.385
Progress would never be made.

16:54.347 --> 17:04.200
And that's the reason that I feel that our deaths are gifts we give to the perpetuation of our species, as a matter of fact, and to human progress.

17:05.962 --> 17:11.670
Just as they were given to us, the deaths of our predecessors were given to us as gifts.

17:11.870 --> 17:23.618
How do you feel then about this research that has the explicit goal of prolonging life, of controlling the aging process?

17:23.902 --> 17:31.651
Well, I like to think of it as research that is investigating the aging process rather than trying to control it.

17:31.671 --> 17:52.153
One of the arguments that I should have made in the book, and actually I didn't think about it until people began discussing it with me as I move around from city to city, is to make clear the difference between what is research and what is applicable at the bedside,

17:52.235 --> 17:59.850
In other words, I am the biggest exponent of basic research imaginable, as I'm sure you must be too.

18:00.171 --> 18:08.067
But the question becomes, how do we apply at the bedside what we learn in the laboratory?

18:08.350 --> 18:18.123
in a time of emphasis, we're living in a time where the public voice is beginning to have something to say in how research is used.

18:18.244 --> 18:30.921
So I say, yes, let's continue every bit of research we can because studying the aging process helps us to study diabetes, helps us to study cancer, helps us to study Alzheimer's, whatever, whatever.

18:31.842 --> 18:35.387
But there has to be increasingly a gap

18:35.789 --> 18:40.655
between what we learn in the laboratory and the way we apply it at the bedside.

18:40.715 --> 18:47.603
Because just as we think about the environment all the time, you know, you can't shoot a lot of chlorine up into the air.

18:47.963 --> 19:00.177
We've got to think of this planet Earth as a single environmental structure that involves not just noxious chemicals that we fling around, but the inhabitants of the Earth as well.

19:01.372 --> 19:07.541
That's a very eloquent answer.

19:09.444 --> 19:23.886
The literature of death and dying, I notice that you bring in... When you tell me that this was almost a stream of consciousness piece of work, I'm amazed because the...

19:23.866 --> 19:27.031
There is so much integrated into the text.

19:27.271 --> 19:32.460
I mean, not only do you draw from your personal experience, but also the literature.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.483
That's why it's a stream of consciousness.

19:34.503 --> 19:38.169
I can't do that unless you're by the stream of consciousness.

19:38.189 --> 19:42.195
You know, you're free associates.

19:42.255 --> 19:48.405
I hesitate to ask you about the book again, obviously, because it does speak for itself.

19:48.925 --> 19:56.412
Who do you envision as your reader, the people who you would like to read this book?

19:57.913 --> 20:00.616
Tell me about the contribution that you hope it makes.

20:02.057 --> 20:02.638
The reader?

20:03.859 --> 20:06.281
What do you hope people come away from the book with, I guess?

20:07.242 --> 20:11.926
I want people to come away from the book with several things.

20:12.366 --> 20:16.350
Perhaps the most important is the recognition

20:16.904 --> 20:20.369
that death is not a medical process.

20:20.810 --> 20:23.674
And let me tell you what I mean by that.

20:23.694 --> 20:23.834
Okay.

20:24.215 --> 20:30.344
I'm privileged, as obviously you are, to have a very intelligent woman that I think would have called my wife.

20:31.025 --> 20:42.321
And through the course of this book, we have had huge, long conversations about the kinds of things I'm writing because at the end of each chapter, she would read it through and we

20:42.554 --> 20:43.716
discuss it.

20:43.736 --> 20:46.662
She made a very interesting point not very long ago.

20:46.702 --> 20:49.969
My four children were born in two platoons.

20:50.389 --> 21:01.191
I had a dreadful first marriage, but I got out of it two spectacular older children who were actually brought up by my second wife to a large extent, so were sort of one family.

21:01.231 --> 21:02.814
The first two kids were born in the 60s.

21:03.395 --> 21:03.415
I

21:03.597 --> 21:07.543
even as a physician, stood outside in the waiting room chewing my nails.

21:07.563 --> 21:10.627
I didn't smoke a cigar except in a figurative sense.

21:10.727 --> 21:16.415
And some guy comes out and says to me, oh, Shep, you know, you've got a boy, or Shep, you've got a girl.

21:16.916 --> 21:20.000
My second two kids were born in the early 80s.

21:20.902 --> 21:26.489
They were delivered by a midwife in a regular bed in a hospital and with an obstetrician close by.

21:26.630 --> 21:32.558
But the midwife delivered those two children with me as part of the team.

21:33.314 --> 21:39.723
Those were the two, and I say this because nothing competes with it, the two most glorious experiences I've ever had in my life.

21:40.224 --> 21:41.626
Why did this happen?

21:41.646 --> 21:45.111
It happened because of the women's movement.

21:45.131 --> 21:49.998
Because women said, pregnancy and delivery, this is not a disease.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.803
Let's do it the way it was meant to be done.

21:53.863 --> 21:55.405
It's part of the natural life cycle.

21:55.606 --> 22:01.414
Well, with death, death has been medicalized.

22:01.765 --> 22:17.281
Going back to 1910 and before, doctors, because prognostication was such an important part of their clinical skill, always knew exactly when to quit.

22:17.301 --> 22:30.135
And at that point, they would step back, and the family then had the privilege of nurturing this person that they had lived with all of their lives until death.

22:31.448 --> 22:53.261
Well, as high-tech medicine gradually took hold in the early part of the century, doctors became much more skilled at fighting the battle, you know, the thrill of rescue, than they were at prognostication, at helping out with providing the good death.

22:53.381 --> 22:59.650
You know, the word euthanasia only means good death, proper death, and it's come to mean something else during the century.

23:01.435 --> 23:17.791
So what I would like to see this book do is to convince patients, families, people, all of us, and convince the medical profession, my colleagues in the medical profession, that they've got to be much more wise about futility.

23:18.472 --> 23:29.162
They've got to be much more wise about the kinds of research protocols they inflict on people that have such a small chance of helping anyone.

23:29.182 --> 23:30.784
And they've got to step back

23:31.169 --> 23:49.381
when the end point of any significant possibility of help is reached, and let the family, whether through a hospice situation or just a regular family situation, nurture that patient until the end of the time that they have.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.304
How do you feel...

23:51.824 --> 24:18.878
about the efforts of this dr kevorkian i mean you mentioned the word euthanasia uh and of course he's become kind of a a strange um player i guess in this drama but uh any comment at all on this well let me just say something about kevorkian you know of all the great things the hippocratic physicians left us i think the greatest is the so-called hippocratic aphorisms you know the

24:18.858 --> 24:22.544
50 and more maxims and mottos or sayings.

24:23.124 --> 24:27.611
The very first maxim, which gets quoted all the time, goes like this.

24:28.853 --> 24:31.497
Art, the art of medicine, is long.

24:31.517 --> 24:33.360
The life of the physician is short.

24:34.061 --> 24:35.703
Opportunity is fleeting.

24:36.244 --> 24:38.688
Experience is delusive.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.711
Judgment is difficult.

24:41.412 --> 24:42.874
You know, we train these young people.

24:42.989 --> 24:46.053
We train them for five, six, seven years after medical school.

24:46.073 --> 24:46.914
What are we teaching them?

24:46.934 --> 24:55.885
We're not teaching them how to take out a gallbladder a better way or do a laparoscopy or titrate miliosmels in a kidney.

24:55.905 --> 24:57.067
We're teaching them judgment.

24:57.167 --> 24:59.229
We're teaching them how to make decisions.

24:59.350 --> 25:06.318
We're not teaching them how to give digitalis but when to give digitalis, that kind of thing.

25:07.340 --> 25:07.680
Well...

25:08.032 --> 25:12.619
You know the New England Journal of Medicine actually has a new feature about clinical judgment.

25:12.639 --> 25:14.622
We write books about clinical judgment.

25:14.702 --> 25:20.610
Along comes a man who went to medical school for four years and never saw a living patient again.

25:21.271 --> 25:30.805
He's never sat in a responsible position at the bedside of a patient who was dying of any disease whatsoever.

25:30.825 --> 25:36.233
He then presumes to think that he knows how to judge people

25:37.057 --> 25:44.223
Number one, when a patient is ready to die, and number two, what a patient means when he says, I want to die.

25:44.884 --> 25:50.489
You know the work of Timothy Quill up there in Rochester at Genesee Hospital.

25:51.110 --> 25:53.692
He's written this marvelous book, Death with Dignity.

25:53.712 --> 25:56.614
I like it so much there's a blurb by me on the back of it.

25:57.435 --> 26:05.022
Quill points out, and he wrote in an article in the JMA in, I think, October and November,

26:05.542 --> 26:12.070
That when a patient says, I want to die, he almost never really means he wants his life to end.

26:12.090 --> 26:29.811
If you sit down with him, as a good clinical physician would or should, and examine what the problem is that brings him to say this, he will very often discover, as you discover, that what is required is something quite different than death.

26:30.331 --> 26:30.992
Pain relief.

26:31.012 --> 26:36.199
One of the most common reasons people ask to die is that the pain is intolerable.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.624
Most clinical physicians treat pain badly.

26:40.585 --> 26:47.555
Most hospitals now, because of that, have a pain service that tends to be run by the anesthesiologists.

26:47.575 --> 26:54.064
Hospice claims they can relieve pain effectively in 93% of cases, and they're probably right.

26:54.084 --> 26:58.009
So some of Quill's patients have been found simply

26:59.170 --> 27:04.881
to be unable to bear pain, which actually can be controlled.

27:04.901 --> 27:08.047
There are psychosocial reasons people say, I want to die.

27:08.548 --> 27:20.470
An aging mother is afraid that if she somehow gets out of the hospital on this trip and dies a month from now in her daughter's home, she will destroy the fabric of her daughter's family.

27:21.344 --> 27:29.934
There are spiritual problems where a patient begins to doubt out of the depression of terminal illness what his life has meant.

27:30.474 --> 27:36.381
And it may be long conversations with a doctor or a minister or a social worker or who knows what.

27:36.741 --> 27:44.931
But it's a fascinating article in which he chooses, I think it's six different reasons that patients say, I want to die.

27:44.951 --> 27:46.913
Kevorkian doesn't understand this.

27:47.247 --> 28:02.073
To me, one of the, and I say amusing in a considered sense, but the phrase so-and-so attempted suicide four times or six times, really the act of suicide should be the easiest thing in the world to do.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.736
I'm agreeing with you.

28:04.257 --> 28:08.344
If the person really was intent upon carrying out the action.

28:08.813 --> 28:12.938
I mean, it's very easy to kill another person, it seems to me.

28:12.998 --> 28:15.821
I mean, it's done every minute of the day, you know.

28:17.022 --> 28:21.928
Why should it be so difficult then to perform the same act in yourself?

28:21.988 --> 28:25.733
I think because what you're saying is they really don't want to do it.

28:26.033 --> 28:30.518
Well, you know, as you're talking, I suddenly remembered something that I hadn't even thought about.

28:30.802 --> 28:36.768
You know, when somebody attempts suicide like this, we always say, well, it's really a cry for help.

28:36.788 --> 28:39.631
That's exactly what it is with Kevorkian's patients.

28:39.711 --> 28:46.517
It's a cry for help, and Kevorkian doesn't know that, doesn't recognize it, and wouldn't know how to give the help in the first place.

28:46.537 --> 28:53.364
I mean, his background really is, he was not a performing, an active physician, is that correct?

28:53.384 --> 28:54.345
Not a clinical physician.

28:54.365 --> 28:55.586
Not a clinical physician.

28:55.986 --> 28:56.607
Not a clinical physician.

28:57.008 --> 29:06.641
I don't know a single pathologist and plenty of people I know well are pathologists who would presume to make a clinical decision like this.

29:07.983 --> 29:10.647
I think this is more about Kevorkian than anything else.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.850
Of course, he has given a good service.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.492
He has heated up the debate.

29:14.793 --> 29:18.017
He's made people think about things they would not otherwise think about.

29:18.678 --> 29:23.725
And sane people are getting into this, and I think changes will occur.

29:24.515 --> 29:31.686
I think that they're happening all the time in a less melodramatic way, too.

29:31.786 --> 29:39.057
I mean, you point out that pneumonia, for instance, is the friend of the aging person.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.642
I think a lot of, I suspect...

29:43.094 --> 29:49.265
A lot of people are allowed to die of pneumonia that could probably be prolonged heroically.

29:49.286 --> 29:50.267
This is just my guess.

29:50.508 --> 29:52.712
In nursing homes, it happens every day.

29:52.732 --> 29:59.404
It happens every day, and they're allowed to drift gracefully away.

29:59.484 --> 30:04.073
I'm making this assumption, but I suspect...

30:04.053 --> 30:08.780
You also point out that there really is, and you say, death with dignity.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.823
I mean, there really is no such thing, is there?

30:11.624 --> 30:17.593
I think it occurs under unusual circumstances, but I think it's a piece of luck.

30:18.535 --> 30:24.984
What I mean is we have no control except in so far as we can stop smoking cigarettes and lower our cholesterol.

30:25.004 --> 30:28.069
We really have no control over what disease is going to kill us.

30:28.289 --> 30:30.212
You and I sit here, two healthy guys.

30:30.192 --> 30:35.921
And who knows what's going to kill you or me, except for some family predisposition, perhaps.

30:36.622 --> 30:47.018
My argument is that the way you die, the disease that carries you off, the suffering that you go through at the end of life, has nothing whatever to do with how you've lived your life.

30:47.038 --> 30:57.955
And we have this aberrant thinking pattern where we somehow see the entire lives of the people we love through the lens of the way they died.

30:58.205 --> 31:04.452
Now, with Alzheimer's, he can't get out of that because he goes on for so long and you see that degradation for so long.

31:05.053 --> 31:23.194
But why should the fact that my brother died in misery from colon cancer color the magnificent things that he did for me, the kind of family that he put together, the way he brought himself up from being the son of immigrants who couldn't read or write?

31:24.135 --> 31:24.415
This is tough.
