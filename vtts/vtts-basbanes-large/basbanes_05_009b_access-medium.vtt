00:02.613 --> 00:17.179
I have a friend in Transylvania who lives in the very same house where the great big mathematicians, Boya's father and son, live.

00:17.817 --> 00:32.795
His father, Karl Molter, M-O-L-T-E-R, was a Hungarian writer, a professor, and he lived in that building, so the family lived in that building since 1921 or 1922.

00:32.855 --> 00:33.256
Wow.

00:34.117 --> 00:38.442
And we have the gentleman's total correspondence.

00:39.350 --> 00:40.712
in one building.

00:40.732 --> 00:41.072
Wow.

00:41.793 --> 00:43.235
And he has his library.

00:44.096 --> 00:57.832
And it went through the Nazi Times, went through the Communist Times, went through the Ceausescu Times, through the post-Causescu Times, and the books there, and the letters, the personal correspondence.

00:57.852 --> 00:59.314
How did they manage to survive?

00:59.374 --> 01:01.496
Through finagling.

01:02.117 --> 01:03.379
Huh.

01:03.399 --> 01:04.760
Through finagling.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.202
I'd love to talk to this person.

01:06.863 --> 01:07.283
You will.

01:07.964 --> 01:08.665
And to his wife.

01:09.252 --> 01:11.775
And, you know, they are both writers.

01:12.836 --> 01:29.976
And they will arrange for you to go to the so-called Peleki Library in Romania, which is one of the most mind-boggling but unknown libraries.

01:32.578 --> 01:33.199
Sounds great.

01:33.640 --> 01:33.960
Oh, yeah.

01:34.767 --> 01:40.913
And then you will have to make the arrangements, but I can help you through the University of Chicago.

01:41.874 --> 01:48.321
You must go to the great library in Egypt, in Alexandria.

01:48.721 --> 01:51.384
There's no library there, though.

01:51.464 --> 01:53.926
I mean, the library was burned to the ground, wasn't it?

01:53.946 --> 01:55.288
I was there with Sada.

01:55.928 --> 02:00.413
There is the spirit of the books, not one book.

02:00.433 --> 02:03.576
But you go in there and you get the creeps.

02:04.535 --> 02:05.817
You know what I mean?

02:06.918 --> 02:07.159
Yeah.

02:07.179 --> 02:08.761
So you stand on that spot, right?

02:09.522 --> 02:11.385
Do they know where the spot was, is?

02:11.405 --> 02:24.784
First you go to the library in Israel where they have the dead sea squirrels.

02:25.945 --> 02:34.137
And after you see all that, then you go to Alexandria and go in that room where they had all the squirrels.

02:36.192 --> 02:38.034
you know?

02:38.054 --> 02:43.741
And they will be able to tell you in Cairo what did the books there.

02:44.862 --> 02:49.828
You see, the University of Chicago has a campus in Egypt.

02:49.848 --> 02:51.510
That's something you didn't know?

02:51.530 --> 02:51.770
No.

02:53.412 --> 03:01.021
And this campus is built by the Rockefeller family before air condition was invented.

03:01.962 --> 03:04.765
So they build the building so that the walls are from

03:05.048 --> 03:18.704
white marble and pumped water from the roof trickles down all day on one or the other side of the roof.

03:18.724 --> 03:27.554
And the sunshine is evaporating the water and it cools the roof.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.114
Amazing.

03:29.015 --> 03:31.258
And there are the old Egyptian scrolls

03:32.825 --> 03:35.929
Gee, this is in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem?

03:36.590 --> 03:39.173
No, no, this is in Egypt.

03:39.193 --> 03:40.075
This is in Egypt?

03:40.555 --> 03:45.482
That's the University of Chicago's campus in Luxor.

03:45.882 --> 03:46.803
This is in Luxor?

03:47.384 --> 03:48.426
Yeah.

03:48.446 --> 03:54.073
You know, I collected books, but I also went to places.

03:56.264 --> 03:57.085
You know what I mean?

03:57.105 --> 03:57.926
I know what you mean.

03:58.327 --> 04:01.171
I'm just sitting here in great envy.

04:01.451 --> 04:02.973
No, no, no.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.475
You'll be on all these places.

04:06.097 --> 04:07.519
You are the guy who do this.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.544
You think I can do all this in about six months?

04:12.066 --> 04:13.888
No, no.

04:13.908 --> 04:14.910
How long is it going to take me?

04:15.310 --> 04:19.656
You will have to figure more 14 to 15 months.

04:20.243 --> 04:25.209
because you want this book again to be a blockbuster bestseller.

04:25.229 --> 04:29.113
Yeah, but I mean, I'm going to start writing, you know, next year.

04:29.774 --> 04:32.317
But I can still continue to do these trips, you see.

04:32.637 --> 04:33.038
Absolutely.

04:33.759 --> 04:35.841
I still want this book to come out in 1999.

04:35.961 --> 04:40.907
It will come out, but you have to promise me one thing.

04:40.927 --> 04:41.107
Yeah.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.751
On some of these things, you have to take your life with you.

04:45.813 --> 04:46.674
God, I hope so.

04:47.575 --> 04:48.816
It's, you know, it's...

04:50.213 --> 04:51.355
We'll see, we'll see.

04:51.375 --> 05:11.447
These trips, we're talking a very expensive proposition, you know, but I really want to take her to... You know, if you want to avoid expensive things, you know what are the expensive things?

05:11.467 --> 05:11.768
Go ahead.

05:11.928 --> 05:12.830
Headache pills.

05:14.292 --> 05:14.873
What pills?

05:15.213 --> 05:16.255
Headache pills.

05:16.741 --> 05:17.362
What are they?

05:17.402 --> 05:19.948
Anti-acid, like aspirin.

05:19.968 --> 05:22.915
You know?

05:23.095 --> 05:23.255
Uh-huh.

05:23.275 --> 05:24.338
Avoid the headaches.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.122
Oh, headache pills.

05:27.385 --> 05:29.369
Yes, that's expensive.

05:29.389 --> 05:31.213
Funerales are expensive.

05:31.233 --> 05:32.977
Hospitals.

05:32.997 --> 05:34.861
What you enjoy is not expensive.

05:34.881 --> 05:36.184
It's never expensive.

05:38.476 --> 05:39.137
I love you.

05:39.197 --> 05:39.698
That's great.

05:41.641 --> 05:42.622
Sure.

05:43.103 --> 05:44.785
I'm going to take her on some of these trips.

05:45.747 --> 05:47.589
Sarajevo, she said she'll stay home.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.372
She doesn't want to go to the shooting.

05:49.853 --> 05:55.641
I don't blame her, but I will talk to you on another occasion, at length, on Sarajevo.

05:57.825 --> 06:04.855
What I'm going to do now, I'm going to listen to this tape and write down some of these places, and then I'm going to try and start figuring out an itinerary, you know?

06:05.392 --> 06:08.415
And... Send me a copy.

06:08.435 --> 06:08.755
Okay.

06:08.815 --> 06:14.360
And then I think I haven't really made any plans yet for traveling.

06:14.400 --> 06:22.988
I was really advised to wait until the International League of Antigran Booksellers in September because I'm going to meet a lot of European booksellers.

06:23.328 --> 06:23.669
I know.

06:23.789 --> 06:32.256
And they will try to mislead you all over because they will keep their own interest in mind.

06:32.417 --> 06:35.179
But my interest is that you do the best book.

06:35.497 --> 06:36.859
Oh, I will do the best book.

06:37.239 --> 06:37.920
I know you will.

06:39.322 --> 06:44.428
I mean, I have these people now, they want me to do a whole chapter on women's studies, you know.

06:45.449 --> 06:50.155
And I said, you know, I mean, that would be the most boring goddamn thing I could possibly do.

06:50.815 --> 06:51.937
Not if you talk to me.

06:52.237 --> 07:03.050
But I am going to do women's studies, but in the context of also the whole argument of what makes a book worthy of entry into the canon, you know.

07:03.110 --> 07:03.951
Makes, makes.

07:05.197 --> 07:11.638
I just let somebody make a computer study.

07:11.658 --> 07:16.754
I have the first book on women's fashion in my library, in my collection.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.801
Only seven known copies.

07:20.013 --> 07:29.404
Last time it was sold in England in 1985 for 6,200 pounds.

07:30.325 --> 07:33.469
That's a woman's book.

07:33.489 --> 07:41.618
That would give you a title page for the chapter like you have on your Gentleman's.

07:42.379 --> 07:48.366
I also have an original first edition of the first

07:49.088 --> 07:58.767
book on woman's right, which was a Transylvanian book on woman's right in the 1600s, early 1600s.

08:00.370 --> 08:05.139
Woman's study, if you handle it right, can be very interesting.

08:05.159 --> 08:05.740
I think so.

08:06.281 --> 08:07.283
Very exciting.

08:07.938 --> 08:10.902
You know who I had a wonderful visit with when I was in Chicago?

08:10.922 --> 08:13.005
It was Abel Berland.

08:13.466 --> 08:16.791
Oh, he's a terrific guy.

08:16.811 --> 08:20.136
And he calls me late at night sometimes.

08:20.897 --> 08:22.239
He wants to talk about books.

08:22.319 --> 08:24.102
I spent six hours with his books.

08:24.983 --> 08:26.325
I've never seen anything like it.

08:27.086 --> 08:27.967
It was unbelievable.

08:29.189 --> 08:31.272
So anyway, I think we're on the right track here.

08:31.593 --> 08:32.694
Nice to talk to you.

08:32.714 --> 08:33.996
Thank you, Chef Louis.

08:34.263 --> 08:38.041
And my best to yours as well.

08:39.307 --> 08:39.649
Bye-bye.
