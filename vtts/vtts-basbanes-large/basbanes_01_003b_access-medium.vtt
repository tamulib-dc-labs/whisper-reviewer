WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:03.629
Okay, I'm going.

00:03.649 --> 00:05.270
He said to you.

00:05.290 --> 00:08.653
He said they aren't worth a damn for turning, for selling.

00:09.134 --> 00:13.598
They had library marks, and they're too... So he knew a little bit about it.

00:13.618 --> 00:16.821
They were too unique to sell.

00:17.101 --> 00:28.232
See, what had happened is Shin had gotten busted, and his wife had, through connections he had, approached somebody who approached DeFabio,

00:28.634 --> 00:33.979
for some quick money to get his bail to get him out, and he looked at the books and rejected them.

00:33.999 --> 00:36.781
He says, I can't turn them and make any money, but he knew about it.

00:36.821 --> 00:40.064
He'd met his wife, and you see, Sin got busted.

00:40.084 --> 00:42.786
His wife was staying there, and I don't know.

00:42.806 --> 00:45.869
According to DeFabio, they didn't get all the books.

00:45.929 --> 00:58.540
Somebody else bought them, loaned her the money, and then some of them were exchanged, like, for a plea arrangement because he pled, but they didn't get them all, but he looked at

01:00.038 --> 01:17.197
Shortly after he'd been arrested, like they, you know, he got, he, like, jumped bond and they found more of them, but, like, he got arrested and they seized what was in the motel, but there was another cash somewhere in the area that DeFabio looked at and wouldn't loan any money on.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.903
So, but, where'd you get the shim catalog?

01:24.064 --> 01:24.965
Oh, uh, out west.

01:26.948 --> 01:27.088
Uh-huh.

01:27.108 --> 01:28.189
In the open stacks.

01:28.861 --> 01:29.964
Just in the open space?

01:32.692 --> 01:32.772
Yes.

01:32.792 --> 01:38.088
That's interesting, and that's like a computerized thing too, right?

01:38.108 --> 01:38.208
Yeah.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.853
But it isn't very complete.

01:39.873 --> 01:42.601
It's a complete... It's completed, I guess I could make it.

01:42.621 --> 01:43.343
Yeah, but it was just...

01:43.677 --> 01:46.321
Is that something on fire over there?

01:46.761 --> 01:48.424
It looks like a burn off of gas.

01:49.105 --> 01:52.750
That's a refinery.

01:53.651 --> 01:55.334
I'm sure you could probably get that.

01:56.155 --> 01:57.737
It's not a rarity.

01:57.918 --> 01:58.458
I know that.

01:58.478 --> 02:07.792
I was just curious about why they entered it into evidence and why you had it and why you particularly were interested in it.

02:07.812 --> 02:09.955
I thought you might articulate it for me.

02:12.871 --> 02:23.367
But I wanted to pass on that little information about that the books were... An underworld figure was approached on lending money.

02:23.607 --> 02:28.615
And I personally... Yeah, I personally knew this guy in the penitentiary.

02:28.635 --> 02:32.621
So I don't know if she and himself... What did this guy DeFavio say to you?

02:32.641 --> 02:38.369
Was he amused by your... Well, he said, well, why didn't you get into jewels or something that was more liquid?

02:38.389 --> 02:40.853
You know, why... And what did you just tell them?

02:41.120 --> 02:43.402
Well, I told him I wasn't interested in selling them.

02:44.724 --> 02:49.549
You know, he said, a man of your talents has wasted it on books.

02:51.811 --> 02:53.173
That's wonderful.

02:53.193 --> 02:53.653
That's wonderful.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.535
And this is from inside the penitentiary.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.517
Nobody could get it.

02:56.837 --> 03:01.402
The only way you get an interview with the Fabio is you get busted going to the penitentiary.

03:01.422 --> 03:07.248
I looked him up in this mob book, and he's in there with, he was a friend of Tony Solano's.

03:07.268 --> 03:08.409
He was another guy that was in there.

03:08.469 --> 03:08.850
Now, what?

03:08.870 --> 03:10.992
Did you look after Fabio, or did he look you up?

03:11.326 --> 03:14.370
We both kind of... Yeah, yeah.

03:14.891 --> 03:17.034
Now, were these guys kind of interested in you?

03:17.234 --> 03:17.895
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:17.915 --> 03:20.479
There were a lot of people in the penitentiary industry.

03:20.499 --> 03:22.361
They thought, oh, wow, $20 million.

03:22.421 --> 03:26.467
Why didn't you offer stuff, you know?

03:26.487 --> 03:29.811
And you always had to say the same thing, but I didn't want to sell them, right?

03:29.832 --> 03:31.133
Yeah, and I thought I was crazy.

03:33.737 --> 03:34.718
Because you loved them.

03:34.738 --> 03:34.919
Yeah.

03:35.419 --> 03:37.983
Let's see, again, it's all bibliomania.

03:38.103 --> 03:39.645
Yeah.

03:39.895 --> 03:40.897
That's a great story.

03:41.357 --> 03:42.679
Thanks for telling me that story.

03:42.699 --> 03:43.020
I like that.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.183
It's sort of an anenda to the Shin affair.

03:45.363 --> 03:49.429
I will not probably name the Fabio in my story.

03:49.449 --> 03:54.577
I would just say a well-known mafia chief, because I don't want to screw around with these guys either.

03:54.617 --> 03:57.782
Yeah, look up to Fabio in the mafia, but he don't.

03:57.982 --> 04:01.948
Yeah, don't show around with him.

04:02.289 --> 04:08.518
In fact, I got to be such good friends with him, I gave him my name and address, and he's going to be out in about three years.

04:08.920 --> 04:18.993
He had some people heisting antiques around Cleveland from these estates and stuff, and he was an antique and somewhat of a book lover.

04:19.073 --> 04:23.279
He told me he'd gotten some stuff from the Cleveland Public Library.

04:23.339 --> 04:25.522
I don't know if it was legitimate or illegitimate.

04:25.542 --> 04:30.949
He built this big house and built this library, and there were these custom-built walnut bookcases.

04:30.989 --> 04:32.871
He wanted these nice books in there.

04:33.552 --> 04:38.218
He was a connoisseur of more antiques and stuff.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.675
So we got to be buddies.

04:39.735 --> 04:43.821
He was sort of like Saturday afternoon, I'd go sit out in the yard with Martin.

04:44.903 --> 04:45.965
That was his first name, Martin?

04:46.025 --> 04:47.848
Martin B. Fabio, yeah.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.750
Was he a gentleman?

04:51.613 --> 04:55.800
I mean, to meet him, would you recognize him as a mobster?

04:56.120 --> 04:56.921
Not a scholar.

04:57.002 --> 05:05.435
No, he was, yeah, by what he did, he more or less loaned money for gambling and that kind of stuff.

05:05.455 --> 05:05.775
Yeah.

05:06.025 --> 05:08.467
But he appreciated nice things.

05:08.748 --> 05:11.611
Did he have the respect of the other people at the penitentiary?

05:11.631 --> 05:12.492
Oh, very much so.

05:13.172 --> 05:15.174
He didn't even sit with those guys.

05:15.194 --> 05:22.622
Like, for instance, their terms were, I went back to 10 building and people looked at me and said, how do you grade?

05:22.722 --> 05:23.883
And I said, what do you mean?

05:24.043 --> 05:26.826
He said, well, you were sitting with the Fabio and Salerno.

05:27.587 --> 05:28.868
And I said, what do you mean?

05:28.888 --> 05:30.270
They looked like nice old guys.

05:30.310 --> 05:31.271
I didn't know who they were.

05:31.671 --> 05:33.653
They said, well, for instance,

05:33.852 --> 05:35.554
the toads can't even sit near there.

05:35.655 --> 05:37.177
And I said, well, what do they mean by toads?

05:37.217 --> 05:38.238
And that's black people.

05:40.161 --> 05:47.852
I guess if a black man would go and even sit with those people casually, they'd be, because there were young guys all around there.

05:47.872 --> 05:50.716
These are old men, but they're sort of young guys who are like bodyguards.

05:51.257 --> 05:57.987
And unless you're accepted, you know, you're sitting at picketeers, unless you're accepted by this group,

05:58.118 --> 06:02.083
You're kindly asked to leave, and if you don't cooperate, there are more.

06:02.244 --> 06:03.505
It would be in your best interest.

06:03.525 --> 06:04.266
Yeah.

06:04.286 --> 06:07.471
But I would just, they were curious of me.

06:07.491 --> 06:08.912
So they invited you to join them.

06:09.073 --> 06:09.353
Yeah.

06:09.774 --> 06:13.479
Yeah, so I had them as buddies to talk to in there, you know.

06:14.240 --> 06:20.548
And I, you know, here I buy this book on the mafia figures, and I find a couple of names in there.

06:21.018 --> 06:48.477
sort of like nice old guys they don't dress any different old men that i talked to i hadn't even i knew salerno was i hadn't even realized you know yeah but it's interesting of his affiliations and his connection with the shin affair that little tidbit well he he knew it though huh oh yeah see one of the some of the one of the things i would say

06:48.828 --> 06:53.034
Shin, he bought a lot of stuff for Japanese collectors, too.

06:53.054 --> 06:54.576
Have you ever heard that?

06:54.596 --> 06:55.838
For offshore collectors.

06:55.858 --> 06:59.002
Oh, oh, he fenced it off to him, huh?

06:59.062 --> 07:00.845
He stole to order, I guess.

07:00.865 --> 07:04.169
He was given, like, a punch list, and he would go hit it, you know?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.776
That's what they say.

07:08.796 --> 07:13.182
They must have the connections to offered if you move to Fabio and need to raise some money quick.

07:14.714 --> 07:19.979
There's some things you don't want to get too deeply into.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.341
I mean, as far as I'm concerned.

07:21.701 --> 07:25.184
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:25.205 --> 07:27.427
Health and happiness is too important, you know.

07:31.551 --> 07:42.662
In a way that made me feel good in there, I knew by the group that I was accepted by in there, I would be... I had another fellow who was a money...

07:43.216 --> 08:09.156
launderer who was sort of a would associate with me he was a fella antiquer from up in quincy he got some trouble for money laundering and different things but he was a great big guy and he and i kind of got to be friends and he sort of was like my heavy i was in the chow hall and i sneezed i had a terrible cold on a black guy's food across from me and it was my fault

08:09.490 --> 08:11.953
The guy got irate, and I apologized.

08:11.973 --> 08:13.715
I said, I'll go up and get you some more food.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.017
This is my fault.

08:15.037 --> 08:18.561
And this friend of mine, his name's Brian Watson, threw a silverware down.

08:19.122 --> 08:21.205
He said, I don't like the company we're sitting next to.

08:21.245 --> 08:23.367
And I said, well, it's my fault.

08:23.387 --> 08:24.048
I'll straighten it out.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.530
I had the black guy calm down.

08:25.570 --> 08:28.133
He said, I'm not going to tolerate this.

08:28.153 --> 08:29.395
This black guy got irate.

08:29.415 --> 08:35.042
And he said, any time, any time, these guards all rest up, and we walk off with our trays,

08:35.630 --> 08:38.694
And he said, you just come at me in the yard, you know?

08:38.874 --> 08:40.976
And this guy was... He was going.

08:41.517 --> 08:42.558
He was getting serious.

08:42.578 --> 08:46.082
Yeah, and it was all over something I'd done, and it was my fault.

08:46.102 --> 08:52.530
I had sneezed on this fellow's group, but this guy, I could see I had a guardian angel in the penitentiary, you know?

08:53.150 --> 09:01.280
I don't know if it was, you know, it was partly through my conduct, but you have stature in there somewhat by your crying, you know?

09:01.300 --> 09:01.620
Yeah.

09:02.377 --> 09:05.442
So they were kind of intrigued by it.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.904
Yeah, the dollar figure.

09:07.726 --> 09:09.248
But also the verve, I guess.

09:09.408 --> 09:10.610
Yeah.

09:10.630 --> 09:17.681
You know, I wasn't another bank robber or a kidnapper or something.

09:22.810 --> 09:29.380
He doesn't attend for $20 million in books, isn't he?

09:30.305 --> 09:35.414
You've got to know your titles, too.

09:35.534 --> 09:45.291
I've been waiting for the arrow, but I don't know.

09:45.892 --> 09:48.918
Uh-oh, I'll have to wait.

09:52.684 --> 09:53.005
Hello.

09:53.474 --> 09:56.898
Yeah, I thought you'd like to know that about that little thing about Shin.

09:56.918 --> 09:59.001
I think some of Shin's books did get away.

09:59.021 --> 10:00.443
Oh, yeah, I know.

10:00.523 --> 10:02.926
And they're not all recovered.

10:02.946 --> 10:03.106
Yeah.

10:03.146 --> 10:04.848
Well, was it Moffat that figured him out?

10:06.210 --> 10:08.833
Was it Moffat that broke this?

10:08.853 --> 10:09.854
Yeah, yes.

10:10.235 --> 10:16.823
Shin was a clutch using his razor blade, and a staff member's seen him, and he panicked.

10:16.843 --> 10:18.966
It was different than my thing in Riverside.

10:19.006 --> 10:20.227
I blocked my way through that.

10:20.648 --> 10:21.489
Was that right?

10:21.509 --> 10:22.570
All the way through...

10:23.984 --> 10:27.028
the indictment and the conviction, and I've left my way out of it.

10:27.048 --> 10:27.969
They had to set me up.

10:28.009 --> 10:32.354
They never did catch me.

10:32.374 --> 10:32.975
Well, no way.

10:33.216 --> 10:33.996
How did they catch you?

10:34.017 --> 10:34.537
What happened?

10:34.557 --> 10:36.259
With the snitch.

10:36.279 --> 10:38.322
I mean, in Riverside, what happened out there?

10:38.863 --> 10:39.944
What do you mean you've left it?

10:39.964 --> 10:43.889
You actually, if that had been on their toes, it should have been all over right there, shouldn't it?

10:43.909 --> 10:47.513
No, I, well, of course, I didn't have any material.

10:47.533 --> 10:50.417
I was just caught browsing.

10:51.939 --> 10:52.860
With utensils.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.702
But I hadn't used the utensils.

10:55.722 --> 10:58.085
Because they were on your person, right?

10:58.185 --> 11:02.029
You're taking this home, you can make a left right up here.

11:02.049 --> 11:02.229
Oh, okay.

11:02.249 --> 11:05.793
At that bar up here, in that white building.

11:05.813 --> 11:06.994
Yeah, okay.

11:07.014 --> 11:13.381
Well, they claimed they were utensils, but I hadn't used them, or I wasn't in the process to use them.

11:13.401 --> 11:14.903
My briefcase is kind of cluttered.

11:15.844 --> 11:20.569
I had a couple of metal strips and a dental pick, and I'd been using the dental pick on this occasion.

11:20.735 --> 11:25.820
for cleaning the grouting around the stained glass window canes.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.522
And I had a different method.

11:30.684 --> 11:34.648
Did you actually eat a stamp?

11:34.668 --> 11:35.668
Yeah, I had to.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.074
And then how did you get the thing out of there?

11:42.535 --> 11:42.695
What?

11:43.616 --> 11:45.017
Did it just stay inside your body?

11:46.458 --> 11:48.380
No, I chewed it up.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.861
You chewed it up?

11:50.642 --> 11:50.742
Yeah.

11:51.565 --> 11:54.609
What was going through your mind if you were doing that?

11:56.131 --> 11:56.972
They wouldn't find it.

11:59.335 --> 11:59.796
Hi.

11:59.816 --> 12:09.409
Thanks a lot for dating everybody.

12:10.190 --> 12:10.771
Yeah, buddy.

12:10.791 --> 12:12.493
See you, Adam.

12:13.368 --> 12:15.990
You want their address?

12:16.531 --> 12:19.433
Send them one of your newspaper articles.

12:19.673 --> 12:27.400
Say hi to Jerry, will you?

12:27.420 --> 12:33.005
I need a place to run when the shit hits.

12:37.929 --> 12:39.250
You want me to call Ray?

12:39.270 --> 12:41.072
Yeah, why don't you?

12:41.092 --> 12:42.413
You want me to tell him I was with you?

12:44.047 --> 12:46.031
Yeah, why don't you?

12:46.051 --> 12:46.371
Okay.

12:46.391 --> 13:00.437
They're probably, my father's looking for me, I believe, but we wouldn't have got, I don't know when we would have got this chance, and if we would have with Ray or Rhonda, you couldn't have met the young people, because they were part of my life, too.

13:00.557 --> 13:02.321
You lived a day of my life.

13:02.341 --> 13:06.308
I could tell you this, Ray probably, they would have sat and listened to every question I asked him.

13:06.693 --> 13:13.100
Yeah, but these guys wouldn't have been as open and you wouldn't have got the relationship.

13:13.301 --> 13:19.668
I don't know as you and I could have been able to speak as frankly and as kind as we did.

13:19.928 --> 13:20.709
Well, I trust you.

13:20.769 --> 13:21.750
Thank you.

13:21.770 --> 13:24.454
And we're in that trust.

13:30.681 --> 13:33.544
Break my trust in my fellow man.

13:34.013 --> 13:39.939
I mean, it's stung again, but I just can't let it do that.

13:39.959 --> 13:48.888
Let's see, I hold 825, so... It's been a full day, my friend.

13:49.248 --> 13:52.231
Yeah, thank you.

13:52.251 --> 13:55.894
And here we are in Des Moines, Iowa.

13:56.815 --> 13:59.498
Yeah, it was brought back...

13:59.950 --> 14:05.218
I was able to come to life again today for a short while.

14:05.238 --> 14:07.621
Keep the faith.

14:07.641 --> 14:08.683
I wish you were on the jury.

14:10.986 --> 14:12.789
They did talk to me after two seconds.

14:12.949 --> 14:16.674
I mean, if they found out, you know, my book background.

14:17.055 --> 14:19.518
That was one of the questions they asked them, right?

14:19.538 --> 14:21.061
You love books, you collect things.

14:21.742 --> 14:23.885
It is interesting they ask those questions, right?

14:23.905 --> 14:24.726
Yeah.

14:30.325 --> 14:34.070
Are psychiatrists asking questions about the love of books and stuff like that?

14:34.090 --> 14:42.581
Do they ask you to... Well, they know it's... Why do you do this and what do you think of it?

14:42.601 --> 14:43.723
They're not people filed.

14:43.763 --> 14:47.087
They don't know.

14:47.108 --> 14:56.260
They're very interested in what the hell they have to say.

14:56.280 --> 14:56.400
Yeah.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.404
This has been an unexpected... unexpected...

14:59.975 --> 15:01.337
spectacular day.

15:01.357 --> 15:14.234
Well, like I say, I felt sorry for your calling and sort of being neglected.

15:14.254 --> 15:21.122
I thought, well, here's a guy that I think would accept me and develop a patriot and understanding person.

15:21.142 --> 15:23.445
Maybe I can be a psychologist, you know?

15:23.466 --> 15:24.867
It's a beautiful movie, isn't it?

15:24.887 --> 15:24.987
Yeah.

15:25.008 --> 15:25.408
Yeah, it is.

15:25.928 --> 15:29.954
They built that over a 20-year period of time as the state.

15:29.974 --> 15:36.905
They started in 1870, and as the state got funds, they kept building more and more.

15:37.025 --> 15:40.871
It was built between 1870 and 1886.

15:40.891 --> 15:41.652
How do you know all that?

15:41.672 --> 15:43.535
I read it.

15:43.555 --> 15:46.580
Is there anything you don't know about things like this?

15:46.600 --> 15:47.481
You don't know?

15:49.908 --> 15:53.198
It's got four domes, which makes it quite unusual.

15:53.218 --> 15:58.614
It looks like something that should be a pavilion that's fair more than a table.

15:58.634 --> 16:02.044
It's sort of a festive-looking place.

16:10.799 --> 16:12.921
So you think your dad's in town by now?

16:13.382 --> 16:15.705
Oh, I'm sure he is.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.187
He's probably looking all over the place.

16:18.207 --> 16:18.468
They all are.

16:18.488 --> 16:19.229
But I don't want to know him.

16:19.249 --> 16:20.730
Or I'll just tell him I want to.

16:20.750 --> 16:21.071
Tell him what.

16:21.251 --> 16:22.633
Are you going to mention me?

16:22.653 --> 16:24.134
It's up to you.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.597
I don't know.

16:26.617 --> 16:27.979
You mentioned to Ray.

16:27.999 --> 16:30.101
I'm not going to tell him.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.023
So I'm not even going to call him now.

16:32.043 --> 16:33.545
You want me to call him?

16:33.565 --> 16:34.426
Call him, yeah.

16:34.446 --> 16:36.148
You want me to call Ray and tell him what?

16:36.972 --> 16:54.771
I don't think we did anything wrong.

16:54.791 --> 16:55.051
I don't know.

16:55.071 --> 16:56.314
Don't worry about it.

16:59.669 --> 17:02.933
And a wild friend too.

17:02.953 --> 17:03.713
I think he's fine.

17:03.874 --> 17:05.155
I like him a lot.

17:05.576 --> 17:05.976
Yeah, I do too.

17:05.996 --> 17:08.098
And I'm not being patronizing in any way.

17:08.118 --> 17:09.560
He's been very good to me.

17:09.580 --> 17:10.201
Yeah, I know he is.

17:10.261 --> 17:11.162
And I like him.

17:12.864 --> 17:13.124
Oh, shit.

17:13.144 --> 17:16.187
Listen, I'll just go down here and leave me and I'll walk across.

17:16.408 --> 17:17.849
Oh, all right.

17:17.969 --> 17:19.611
Yeah, just leave me here in this lot.

17:19.691 --> 17:20.712
Maybe that's even better.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.414
No, all right.

17:22.434 --> 17:23.415
Why should you go to the front?

17:23.435 --> 17:26.639
They're probably staking that place out looking for it.

17:27.280 --> 17:27.600
You know?

17:28.998 --> 17:31.562
Just drop me right here.

17:31.582 --> 17:34.546
Give me two seconds to get my stuff.

17:34.566 --> 17:37.630
And my friend.

17:37.650 --> 17:38.050
Thank you.

17:38.070 --> 17:42.396
I hope we can be friends and spend some more time here.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.039
I think we are friends.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.804
Maybe someday I can come out to Mass and travel.

17:47.824 --> 17:49.546
I'd like you to meet my wife and my daughters.

17:50.908 --> 17:53.491
Maybe we go booking up in New England.

17:53.632 --> 17:54.513
That's fun.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.374
Oh, I know it is.

17:55.394 --> 17:57.537
We've got a lot of nice little old...

17:58.057 --> 18:00.383
bookstores and new bookstores.

18:00.403 --> 18:02.208
Yeah, I used to do it in upstate New York.

18:02.228 --> 18:02.710
That's right.

18:02.730 --> 18:06.260
We were in with Maine, but for some reason, there was wonderful bookstores.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.729
I was through Maine about this time of year, and everything's closed up there.

18:09.809 --> 18:11.715
Yeah, but I'm full of numbers.

18:11.795 --> 18:12.116
Yeah, yeah.

18:12.557 --> 18:13.720
Listen, you've got to run.
