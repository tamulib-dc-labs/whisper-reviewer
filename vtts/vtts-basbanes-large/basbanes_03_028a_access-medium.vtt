WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.978
Let's just start to run, and then we know it's running.

00:05.960 --> 00:06.581
There it goes.

00:06.921 --> 00:10.567
So, and how do we pronounce your name?

00:10.587 --> 00:12.069
Bellenbach.

00:12.089 --> 00:12.310
Bellenbach.

00:12.330 --> 00:13.952
Okay, very good.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.196
And so you're the managing director of the press.

00:16.436 --> 00:19.080
Can we just kind of enter the conversation in a way?

00:19.100 --> 00:29.717
Yes, I'm managing director of Yale Press London, and I took over two years ago from John Nicol, who was managing director of

00:30.119 --> 00:30.780
30 years.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.801
Was it 30 years?

00:31.821 --> 00:33.664
Another of these long stayers, you see.

00:34.305 --> 00:38.450
I think it was 31 years when he... I didn't realize it was that long.

00:38.470 --> 00:39.852
Yeah, he's my age.

00:40.312 --> 00:41.194
Yes, he is.

00:41.754 --> 00:43.377
And maybe he's younger than me, in fact.

00:43.597 --> 00:45.379
Early 60s, very young 60s.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.443
And yet he was managing director for 30 years.

00:48.483 --> 00:51.587
Yeah, well, you see, he was brought in, I think it was 74.

00:54.171 --> 00:56.294
Chester hired him from OUP.

00:56.634 --> 00:58.877
I mean, John will tell you this, of course, over lunch,

00:59.228 --> 01:02.131
But Chester, I think, hired John from OUP.

01:02.651 --> 01:09.979
And before that, I mean, London was set up in 61, just as a sort of sales entrepote, really.

01:10.479 --> 01:12.261
And it had a sales manager, and so on.

01:12.281 --> 01:13.783
It was just a selling operation.

01:13.803 --> 01:18.167
And then when Chester hired John, it was to start an editorial list.

01:19.148 --> 01:22.792
And John was the art history editor at OUP in Oxford.

01:22.812 --> 01:28.678
And so he came along here and started commissioning and producing mainly art books.

01:28.945 --> 01:37.517
but with the Mellon Centre for British Art, which has been our twin, really, throughout this process, and is the reason why this office exists at all.

01:37.778 --> 01:55.503
But apparently the Mellon Centre, according to John, right, is that it was hemorrhaging money like crazy, and that John came in and was basically this miracle worker.

01:56.064 --> 01:56.385
Yes.

01:56.585 --> 01:58.648
I mean, he will tell you

01:59.287 --> 02:00.448
more about the specifics.

02:00.468 --> 02:06.773
But, yeah, I mean, the Mellon has a lot of money to spend on British art, and they were probably spending it rather haphazardly.

02:06.793 --> 02:14.099
And then John came, and they set up a list called Studies in British Art, and we've been publishing it ever since, really.

02:14.680 --> 02:23.307
And, you know, it's a huge service for the academic study of British painting and art, and a marvellous thing.

02:23.848 --> 02:29.192
And it underwrites, and it doesn't exactly subsidise, because it pays for the books, but doesn't actually pay for much else.

02:29.611 --> 02:32.996
So our list has a lot of British art in it as a result of that.

02:33.637 --> 02:38.303
And the Mellon Centre, at one stage, we shared offices with them in Bloomsbury Square.

02:38.944 --> 02:41.207
And now they're across the way.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.210
We sort of look at them over there in number 12.

02:44.031 --> 02:47.015
And so we've always been Bloomsbury.

02:47.035 --> 02:58.892
I mean, one of the things that I expect you'll pick up is that Yale has always inhabited these few squares, you know, that Virginia Woolf and...

02:59.547 --> 03:06.914
all that lot inhabited before us, throughout our existence, and actually have always been able to see the University of London.

03:06.934 --> 03:13.139
I mean, from my window I can see the Senate House, so in a way we're on a campus, although it's somebody else's campus.

03:13.619 --> 03:16.282
And it's a very booky area of town, really.

03:16.302 --> 03:19.445
The British Museum is over there, the British Library's not very far.

03:20.305 --> 03:26.651
It feels appropriate and honourable to inhabit this area.

03:26.971 --> 03:28.913
Now, I think Yale...

03:29.315 --> 03:43.127
So many American university presses have offices in the UK, but Yale, this division is really a genuine, authentic publishing house on our own.

03:43.327 --> 03:49.012
We have all the functions of the publishing house, and we produce our own books, and we exchange them.

03:49.032 --> 03:51.834
Apparently, perhaps as many as a third of the list.

03:51.914 --> 03:58.900
Yes, I mean, we always say we produce a third of the books

03:59.369 --> 04:01.031
at a quarter of the cost.

04:01.912 --> 04:02.453
Wow.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.718
That's pretty good.

04:05.738 --> 04:14.129
Yeah, I mean, I think that the line is that we've always, because we've been doing specific series of books in art and in history, that we've produced them more efficiently.

04:14.209 --> 04:21.419
And I think John Nichol, who you'll meet, was a superb producer of books and a buyer of print, and he did it in a very good business head.

04:22.501 --> 04:28.149
And he will say, and I think he's right, that we've made the money for the press over the years.

04:28.249 --> 04:29.190
Because New Haven...

04:29.643 --> 04:32.326
has to do a lot of things out of duty to its university.

04:32.626 --> 04:34.168
So it has a lot of books that don't make money.

04:34.928 --> 04:37.951
So it doesn't actually make an operating profit, whereas we do.

04:38.652 --> 04:40.053
So is that the mandate here?

04:40.594 --> 04:41.215
Well, yeah.

04:41.235 --> 04:43.117
We don't have any endowment here.

04:43.137 --> 04:50.364
I mean, New Haven has an endowment which provides them with a certain chunk of cash every year to subsidize.

04:50.804 --> 04:51.225
We don't.

04:51.265 --> 04:56.670
So we have to operate like a normal business and pay our salaries and not make a loss.

04:56.890 --> 04:59.413
Because if we made a loss, then we think that our

04:59.900 --> 05:02.802
Our masters in New Haven would say, well, what is this operation for?

05:04.064 --> 05:08.767
So what do you try to do differently?

05:09.608 --> 05:14.713
What do we do differently from New Haven?

05:15.493 --> 05:21.578
Well, I mean, I think the main thing is that we are four and a half thousand miles away from the university.

05:22.079 --> 05:29.485
So that liberates us to publish outside the box, really.

05:29.954 --> 05:48.634
I mean, New Haven has, to some extent, to satisfy the academic community, it has to satisfy the academy by publishing a certain number of Yale professors, but also to publish a certain number of monographs, you know, detailed specialist books that these days you can't win with.

05:48.654 --> 05:50.836
Whereas we are free of that, really.

05:50.856 --> 05:52.538
We don't necessarily have to do that.

05:52.598 --> 05:59.826
Although, to an extent, we do publish very specialist books when it strikes us as an extraordinarily important book

06:00.228 --> 06:02.772
But by and large, we go for books that have a bigger market.

06:03.653 --> 06:07.518
We also go for books that are international in their scope.

06:08.740 --> 06:16.751
And that maybe is the big difference between the list, because New Haven publishes... It has an American list, really.

06:16.991 --> 06:23.981
I mean, a lot of its books... But I mean, even so, a lot of its books look at the U.S.

06:24.061 --> 06:24.522
and the U.S.

06:24.582 --> 06:27.045
experience in the world.

06:27.397 --> 06:35.905
And it, like every other American press, it publishes endless books on the American Supreme Court and things like that, which we can't sell here.

06:36.885 --> 06:50.738
And right now is an interesting time because just at the sort of post-9-11 moment when Americans are looking at themselves and wondering why everybody dislikes them.

06:50.838 --> 06:55.682
So New Haven is producing more books about American concerns.

06:56.236 --> 07:00.021
just at the time that the rest of the world is not buying them.

07:00.041 --> 07:13.118
So, I mean, I have great trouble telling my American colleagues that this is a fact, because, you know, America is so big and rich and important and well-funded that it can do what it likes.

07:13.738 --> 07:17.203
And in terms of book publishing, it publishes lots of books about itself.

07:18.144 --> 07:22.790
And then it's always mildly surprised that the rest of the world doesn't want to buy them.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.213
I mean, I'm exaggerating and generalizing, of course, but

07:25.615 --> 07:27.477
That is a syndrome.

07:27.777 --> 07:35.346
When you see a book through the press, what do you perceive as your readership, as your market?

07:35.366 --> 07:39.190
You say, I can't sell here, so are you looking for the British market?

07:39.310 --> 07:47.459
Well, you see, we sell, basically New Haven and London divide the world into two in terms of sales territories.

07:47.879 --> 07:49.621
And they do the U.S.

07:49.641 --> 07:54.947
and Canada and South America and Japan and various other areas, whereas we do Europe.

07:55.687 --> 08:01.537
the Middle East, Africa, and some of the Far East.

08:01.937 --> 08:11.132
So basically we divide the world into two, and we sell into these territories, and then at the end of the year we tot up our sales and see how we've done.

08:11.993 --> 08:16.561
But all of your books are listed in the same catalogue, right?

08:16.581 --> 08:17.142
Yes, exactly.

08:17.162 --> 08:22.791
And so really the person who picks up the spring 06 catalogue doesn't really

08:23.463 --> 08:26.767
know whether or not it's being produced out of the UK or New Haven.

08:26.787 --> 08:30.673
You have to be a very sophisticated reader of a catalogue to pick that up.

08:30.693 --> 08:35.740
One of the things you might ask to see at some point is the catalogues.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.108
London produces a catalogue, and New Haven produces a catalogue, and you will see that they are interestingly dissimilar.

08:42.148 --> 08:46.714
The books that New Haven features at the front are not necessarily the ones we buy.

08:46.774 --> 08:48.917
So there are two different catalogues.

08:48.957 --> 08:49.478
Yeah, absolutely.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.681
We do ours for our markets, and they do theirs.

08:51.965 --> 08:59.333
And I think if you see a few, if you get the two catalogues for a few seasons, you'll pick up, you know, the spirit of it.

08:59.733 --> 09:02.236
I mean, often the very big books are the same, obviously.

09:02.256 --> 09:05.540
The books that, again, generate the cash are the same, and we feature them.

09:05.600 --> 09:11.446
But otherwise, our market receives things differently, and so we feature them differently.

09:13.468 --> 09:18.734
There's something that I've just forgotten in relation to that.

09:18.754 --> 09:20.076
But we do have two catalogues.

09:20.096 --> 09:21.297
Oh, yes, the other thing is...

09:21.665 --> 09:25.108
Your question, would a book buyer know where it came from?

09:25.849 --> 09:35.878
You know, I think, well, you would, as a man who's sensitive to books, you would perceive the difference in design and the jacket and that sort of thing.

09:35.898 --> 09:49.731
I mean, there is, it doesn't take long to see the difference between the two because of the, I mean, American books look American, British books look British, and, you know, it's quite subtle, but it's true.

09:50.099 --> 09:56.706
Would you say that Yale is unique among University Press, and certainly American University Press?

09:57.347 --> 10:01.572
It is, really, because it's the only one that has had this international office.

10:01.872 --> 10:03.354
A true international office.

10:03.374 --> 10:06.037
I mean, the others are sales offices, basically.

10:06.057 --> 10:06.697
Yes, that's right.

10:07.078 --> 10:11.623
I'm amused when I see University of California Press, Berkeley, and London, and the last... Are they kidding?

10:11.663 --> 10:12.844
They don't sell.

10:13.044 --> 10:13.565
They sell.

10:14.206 --> 10:17.409
I just went through their list for the spring.

10:17.449 --> 10:18.030
I mean, it's all...

10:18.719 --> 10:23.924
California themes, and that's a very disappointing list.

10:24.405 --> 10:26.927
Very provincial, in fact, which surprises me.

10:27.147 --> 10:44.525
I mean, the fact that the Chester set up the London office was a brilliant way to make the imprint plausible in the rest of the world, because there's nothing like having an imprint which is publishing books that literary editors here think of theirs, to make it all seem real.

10:45.686 --> 10:46.887
And, I mean, Yale London

10:47.660 --> 10:52.385
I mean, a lot of literary reviewers would see us as a British press.

10:52.545 --> 10:55.529
I mean, they know, obviously, that we're owned by the U.S.

10:55.569 --> 11:00.034
and that we're all yet employees, but they see us as a sort of little local press.

11:00.174 --> 11:00.534
Do they?

11:00.635 --> 11:00.975
Yeah.

11:00.995 --> 11:07.903
And our books go out to them, and they see us as they do Granter or Faber or any of the other presses.

11:07.923 --> 11:11.086
I mean, the only parallel I can think of is Oxford's New York.

11:11.487 --> 11:11.727
Yeah.

11:11.842 --> 11:12.865
Which is the inverse.

11:12.885 --> 11:14.589
Which is the inverse, the other way.

11:15.291 --> 11:20.604
And I know absolutely which Oxford books are... I mean, I've been reviewing books for three years.

11:20.644 --> 11:21.326
So you can tell.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.910
Oh, I can tell instantly.

11:22.930 --> 11:29.125
I mean, if there's a book on jazz, American jazz, or something like that, or the Supreme Court, as you say, at Oxford, that's not...

11:29.510 --> 11:31.493
coming out of here, that's coming out of New York.

11:31.794 --> 11:31.974
Right.

11:32.675 --> 11:34.658
But can you see it from the look of the book as well?

11:34.738 --> 11:36.100
I can, yeah.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.384
Their books almost look like they're done by Random House.

11:38.504 --> 11:42.991
I mean, they're very American, I think, in terms of the... It's the same here, you know.

11:43.051 --> 11:43.953
You'd spot it.

11:44.173 --> 11:44.754
You'd spot it.

11:45.916 --> 11:51.585
You know, sometimes we dress books up to look as though they are American books, or vice versa, depending on the subject.

11:51.605 --> 11:55.551
So how would you characterize an American look as opposed to, if you could...

11:56.257 --> 11:59.761
Or is it like, just as Potter Stewart says, I know it when I see it?

12:00.001 --> 12:01.022
Yes, exactly that.

12:01.042 --> 12:11.893
I would say generally the jackets look quite deliberately designed and tasteful, whereas ours tend to be more like posters.

12:13.434 --> 12:20.562
I mean, it's odd that, you know, we are the older culture, and yet somehow American books look more old-fashioned than ours do.

12:21.322 --> 12:23.985
And particularly inside, internally, there's a great tradition of

12:25.180 --> 12:30.630
of tasteful design and little effects and little designs.

12:30.651 --> 12:36.362
Do you think this resonates with the reader as much as it does the person who produces it, the editor?

12:36.382 --> 12:37.023
I think so.

12:37.043 --> 12:46.120
You know, it was interesting that we published our bestseller of last autumn was this E. H. Gombrich.

12:46.321 --> 12:47.543
I have that, yeah.

12:47.843 --> 12:48.864
Did that come out of here?

12:49.085 --> 12:51.067
Yeah, that was, that came out of here.

12:51.087 --> 12:53.771
And this is our edition, and you, I don't know, you've seen the U.S.

12:53.791 --> 12:54.091
edition.

12:54.111 --> 12:54.612
I have a U.S.

12:54.632 --> 12:55.073
edition.

12:55.093 --> 12:56.695
Which has got sort of raggedy pages.

12:56.715 --> 12:57.136
Yeah, yeah.

12:57.156 --> 13:00.019
You know, and looks slightly greyer, but it's the same internally.

13:00.039 --> 13:01.221
Oh, that's a great little book, actually.

13:01.241 --> 13:02.182
Because we designed it here.

13:03.284 --> 13:03.845
Yeah.

13:03.865 --> 13:07.229
Yeah, that's, we sold almost 100,000 copies of it.

13:07.249 --> 13:07.550
Amazing.

13:09.352 --> 13:10.594
Yeah, that's wonderful.

13:10.614 --> 13:14.319
And, uh, but even... Was that a big surprise, or did you expect that?

13:14.479 --> 13:17.403
No, no, well, we knew that Gombrich, of course, was the author of the story of art.

13:17.423 --> 13:17.563
Mm-hmm.

13:17.898 --> 13:27.912
and a big figure, and that, you know, basically high-profile author, large subject, little history of the world, you know, you've got two of the components of a successful book.

13:27.932 --> 13:32.178
Also, the fact that he writes it so beautifully, you know, and he's such a humane and sensitive man.

13:33.239 --> 13:34.722
So we knew it would do well.

13:34.842 --> 13:39.869
I mean, we thought that people might say, oh, what a nice little curiosity, what a sweet little book.

13:40.409 --> 13:40.730
Go away.

13:40.850 --> 13:42.212
But it got terrific press, too.

13:42.232 --> 13:44.395
Yeah, because it's a good book, you know.

13:45.488 --> 13:53.079
You know, from this, you know how history fits together in a way that most of us never do.

13:53.459 --> 13:54.841
You know how it links.

13:55.362 --> 13:56.764
Now tell me a little bit about yourself.

13:56.804 --> 14:01.891
Did you come to Yale from another university press?

14:02.212 --> 14:04.174
No, I came from Weidenfeld.

14:04.615 --> 14:13.167
Okay, so you came from the trade press, but I was looking after their academic list, which wasn't very academic for the bit.

14:13.636 --> 14:24.969
And then I was approached by John Nicol to come here 20 years ago, 1985, to boost the history publishing.

14:25.009 --> 14:30.175
I mean, I'm really a history editor, and John was essentially an art editor.

14:30.235 --> 14:43.170
So when John Ryden and John Nicol decided to expand London from about 12, 15 titles back in the early 80s to now we do 70 or 80 titles a year,

14:43.606 --> 14:47.089
they looked for another editor and that was when I came across.

14:47.930 --> 15:08.150
So I hadn't worked in a university press before and that was one of the attention, one of the attractions for an editor of serious books is to have access to the US market and also an imprint like Yale's which is very prestigious and impressive.

15:08.871 --> 15:12.955
So the idea of doing my kind of books which are

15:13.407 --> 15:23.462
history books not only for academics but for the trade market, with a big imprint like Yale, and being able to publish directly into the U.S.

15:24.223 --> 15:29.551
I mean, at Weidenfeld, like Knopf or anything, across the water you sell to another press.

15:30.993 --> 15:33.256
And so you lose your book in that market.

15:33.316 --> 15:39.585
Whereas here, if I sign a book, then I go to New Haven, I talk to the reps, it's my book.

15:39.886 --> 15:41.468
If there are queries, it comes to me.

15:42.089 --> 15:42.790
So you don't lose it.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.310
So as an editor, you control the world.

15:45.330 --> 15:50.995
It's amazing that you pick up a book published in Great Britain by Faber and Faber or something like that.

15:51.015 --> 15:51.316
Yes.

15:51.536 --> 15:52.477
See what's going on here?

15:52.517 --> 15:54.599
Yes, and it feels different.

15:54.759 --> 15:55.940
I mean, who are your publishers?

15:56.080 --> 15:56.741
HarperCollins.

15:57.081 --> 15:57.682
Right.

15:57.702 --> 15:58.763
So do they do it both sides?

15:59.383 --> 15:59.964
Yeah.

15:59.984 --> 16:01.305
Right.

16:01.325 --> 16:03.948
My first two books were with Holton.

16:04.128 --> 16:05.009
They were so big.

16:05.769 --> 16:07.671
It was a 668-page book.

16:07.711 --> 16:09.773
They were scared to publish it over here.

16:09.905 --> 16:15.153
But, you know, even my books that haven't been published here have had wonderful reviews over here.

16:15.674 --> 16:16.435
Right.

16:16.475 --> 16:21.002
The TLS gave me a bigger review than the New York Times.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.466
Go figure that out, you know.

16:23.486 --> 16:24.768
I can't figure it out.

16:24.788 --> 16:29.936
But, I mean, now with Amazon and globalization, there aren't territories anymore.

16:29.956 --> 16:37.347
You can get, my books sell very well on Amazon UK, as opposed, you know, not just Amazon, I'm sure.

16:38.170 --> 16:40.052
So she has a funny situation.

16:40.833 --> 16:50.264
Do you see, I'd love to have your thoughts on what the function, the role, the 21st century role of a university press is.

16:52.367 --> 16:54.149
Because whatever it is, Yale's got it right.

16:54.850 --> 16:59.215
I mean, we've actually had university presses fold in the United States in the last couple of years.

16:59.275 --> 17:01.157
A number of them, Northeastern, comes to mind.

17:02.959 --> 17:04.040
Yes, Stanford.

17:04.060 --> 17:05.042
Stanford.

17:05.062 --> 17:06.203
And another one.

17:06.740 --> 17:14.230
And all the others operate in the red, Yale, three or four years in a row now, operating in the black, almost unprecedented.

17:14.850 --> 17:17.333
It's amazing that the university press should actually make money.

17:17.774 --> 17:19.516
Yes, yes, it is.

17:19.596 --> 17:23.822
But, I mean, bear in mind that we hired our director from basic books.

17:24.983 --> 17:35.076
And in a way, we are becoming more like basic books, paying advances for books that we didn't used to pay, giving them a trade treatment,

17:35.275 --> 17:43.405
I mean, as you already know, our list is divided into trade books, and scholarly books, and art books, and reference.

17:43.425 --> 17:45.847
I mean, they pay me in advance.

17:45.867 --> 17:46.628
Yes, yes.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.009
And we do.

17:47.029 --> 17:51.754
I mean, sometimes we pay... It's not a HarperCollins advance, but so what?

17:51.794 --> 17:52.716
This is fun, you know?

17:52.776 --> 17:57.481
The prestige of writing a book for Yale is kind of cool.

17:58.522 --> 18:01.986
I mean, in the old days, we almost thought people should pay us to publish with us.

18:02.067 --> 18:03.308
Well, that was the...

18:04.250 --> 18:15.806
Unfortunately, that was what... And now we're competing, you know, we're buying books from agents, we're competing with Penguin Press and HarperCollins and, you know, the Classy Imprints.

18:15.826 --> 18:32.931
According to John Wrighton, I mean, in his view, Yale begins as a press that, or the university press in the United States, almost develops at the same time as scholarship becomes a profession in the United States.

18:32.991 --> 18:33.852
They almost...

18:34.625 --> 18:36.368
emerge at the same time.

18:36.388 --> 18:38.091
Yeah, that's interesting.

18:38.111 --> 18:45.002
And of course how things change, and they weren't expected to make money necessarily.

18:46.504 --> 18:47.045
No, we weren't.

18:47.165 --> 18:51.292
I mean, I think most university presses were expected not to lose it.

18:52.273 --> 18:54.958
And some of them, of course, make big money.

18:55.038 --> 19:00.226
Oxford University Press gives 10, 20 million pounds to the university every year.

19:00.386 --> 19:00.767
Amazing.

19:01.203 --> 19:04.446
Cambridge should do a lot better than it does, it seems to me.

19:04.546 --> 19:07.909
Yes, but they don't do very exciting books, do they?

19:07.929 --> 19:08.269
No.

19:08.370 --> 19:19.740
But, I mean, your question is more what happens to the book, of course, and what is the role of the university press in a culture in which many of our books will be electronic?

19:21.382 --> 19:25.025
And the answer, I guess, is gatekeeping, really choosing.

19:25.425 --> 19:30.670
I mean, the great, the grand publishing projects, those

19:31.038 --> 19:32.740
the Founding Fathers type thing.

19:32.841 --> 19:38.288
These are basically... Can't do them.

19:38.388 --> 19:39.830
And nobody's buying them.

19:39.851 --> 19:44.577
I mean, you can't sell reference as a book these days very much.

19:44.597 --> 19:45.298
I mean, you can sell them.

19:46.139 --> 19:46.860
That's a good point.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.903
I haven't heard it expressed quite like that.

19:48.923 --> 19:49.544
I like that.

19:49.564 --> 19:49.885
Go ahead.

19:50.405 --> 20:00.640
Because, I mean, obviously, for large books which present factual data, which is always changing, it's far better to have it in a

20:01.463 --> 20:10.575
in a form that can develop and grow and have new editions, rather than these colossal great books that cost a fortune and are sold only to libraries.

20:10.735 --> 20:16.422
And libraries, more than anyone else, are aware of the electronic future.

20:16.883 --> 20:21.729
Everyone at Yale told me there was a time, once upon a time, they had standing orders for books.

20:22.230 --> 20:26.796
You could almost guarantee that 6,500 copies of a book would be sold.

20:27.817 --> 20:30.981
And now if you get 600 or 800 copies and the prices go up,

20:31.788 --> 20:35.552
It changes the entire dynamic.

20:35.572 --> 20:38.615
That used to be why university presses had so many series.

20:39.195 --> 20:44.861
Because if you had a series in masterworks of Western culture, then everyone would just buy it automatically.

20:44.881 --> 20:46.943
Once they're committed to it, they have to see it through.

20:47.143 --> 20:48.344
But now they don't, you see.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.845
They buy books individually.

20:49.865 --> 20:52.328
So we have series as a way of attracting authors.

20:53.409 --> 21:00.816
And plus you have universities, I don't know if they do the same thing here, but I wrote about this and one of my books wrote that.

21:01.370 --> 21:06.778
Universities actually establish consortia, like out in western Massachusetts, for instance.

21:06.798 --> 21:13.627
You have Smith, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Hampshire, and University of Massachusetts.

21:14.348 --> 21:24.643
If, let's say, Smith buys, well, they'll probably all get that book, but, you know, Charles I.

21:25.670 --> 21:31.356
Well, all five won't get it, because they have a consortial agreement.

21:32.877 --> 21:36.161
Whereas in the old days, all five of these libraries might be buying the same book.

21:36.201 --> 21:37.843
Only one of them is buying it now.

21:37.983 --> 21:40.165
And a lot of these institutions are doing this.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.027
Yeah, it is.

21:42.227 --> 21:52.618
I mean, it's partly that university libraries spend so much of their income on journals and serials and things, and less and less of it on books.

21:52.838 --> 21:54.900
I think it's like 25 cents of

21:55.133 --> 21:58.977
25% of the library budget is spent on books as a general rule.

21:59.117 --> 21:59.958
Yeah, I know, it's shocking.

21:59.978 --> 22:03.302
It's amazing when you see those figures.

22:04.043 --> 22:09.829
So we have to find our buyers outside the Academy, and that's the story of University Presses.

22:09.849 --> 22:12.512
So you have to have a certain kind of book to reach those people.

22:12.532 --> 22:24.786
I have to say, long before I was invited to do this project for Yale, I just regard the Yale art books as, by far,

22:25.255 --> 22:27.097
I mean, I've been reviewing them for 25 years.

22:27.197 --> 22:29.840
The most extraordinary art books, by far.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.521
They're the most beautiful.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.164
They have the best scholarship.

22:35.265 --> 22:37.928
They're not these little vapid things with pretty pictures.

22:37.988 --> 22:43.633
I mean, they're... Yes, they're real books, which have illustrations that are integral to the text.

22:43.793 --> 22:49.679
And it's amazing how year after year after year, you still do 15 or 20 of them, however many.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.902
Every one of them, you want to have every one.

22:53.223 --> 22:54.604
They're so wonderful.

22:54.888 --> 22:55.869
Well, I mean, John Nichols.

22:55.889 --> 22:57.271
And I guess that's John Nichols.

22:57.291 --> 22:57.951
John Nichols.

22:57.971 --> 22:59.633
He's the genius about that.

23:00.434 --> 23:04.479
And if we can continue that now without him, we'll be doing well.

23:04.919 --> 23:10.265
I mean, fortunately, we have two art editors in this office who are trained by John and are very good.

23:10.625 --> 23:14.450
And then there's Patricia Fidler in the US office who is extremely good.

23:14.470 --> 23:20.756
So we have three full-time art history editors pushing out books at a huge rate.

23:22.038 --> 23:24.000
And I think we must be the most...

23:24.503 --> 23:27.628
the highest quality art to publish in the world.

23:27.648 --> 23:30.252
Oh, I think without peer.

23:30.513 --> 23:33.738
I mean, there are other presses like Biden and Thompson and Tash.

23:33.758 --> 23:34.439
I see them all.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.222
Who do, you know, what they do.

23:36.363 --> 23:37.585
I get a ton of review books.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.249
I've been doing this for 25 or 30 years.

23:40.309 --> 23:50.646
I review for half a dozen, ten newspapers, and especially at the holidays I do these big... So, I mean, I get the books, and I really do compare them.

23:50.980 --> 23:52.462
Abrams used to do a nice job.

23:52.482 --> 23:53.343
Yeah, they had a good list.

23:53.423 --> 23:53.943
They used to.

23:54.003 --> 23:55.084
Not anymore.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.708
There's some nice tashin, I think that's some nice stuff.

23:58.868 --> 24:01.471
But yours are so superior.

24:02.132 --> 24:03.614
Well, our text is good, you see.

24:03.634 --> 24:06.557
I mean, the scholarship, the text is outstanding.

24:07.057 --> 24:16.067
But John, I mean, if you remember, ask him about the problems facing art history publishers and the reasons why so few of us survive.

24:16.167 --> 24:19.030
And he will say, I'm sure, it's the cost of the images.

24:20.309 --> 24:26.676
It's the picture archives and the museums and galleries who are charging more and more.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.499
So what's the trick?

24:29.219 --> 24:40.212
Well, I mean, the trick is to be, you know, deft of foot and choose where you're going to get your illustrations, and in a way to make the authors pay for them.

24:40.232 --> 24:45.899
But it gets harder and harder because all these museums and galleries regard their picture library as a source of funds.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.662
So they screw us for money.

24:49.908 --> 24:51.550
I'm quoting John Wright.

24:51.770 --> 24:54.253
I brought the transcript.

24:54.413 --> 24:56.215
I transcribed these things myself.

24:56.596 --> 24:56.776
Right.

24:57.337 --> 24:59.799
And so I just thought I'd read his on the way over.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.162
Couldn't sleep on the airplane last night, so I was reading.

25:02.182 --> 25:19.442
But he said, years ago, when there was admittedly much organization whose function was to publish works which no one would read, he said there was quite naturally as little

25:19.810 --> 25:26.536
general interest in its organization as it was in its function.

25:26.557 --> 25:39.589
University presses at one point were, I guess to go back to what we were saying, were not expected to produce books that were compelling and interesting and that would actually sell in the marketplace.

25:40.350 --> 25:44.294
Yale has actually had two books that have sold over a million copies.

25:46.035 --> 25:48.838
One of the great publishing stories of Yale is Eugene O'Neill,

25:48.987 --> 25:50.870
Yeah, sure.

25:50.890 --> 25:53.834
I've got that one nailed.

25:53.954 --> 25:57.078
And then they do things like the Yale Younger Poets series.

25:57.238 --> 25:58.220
Sure, yeah.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.221
Which is fantastic.

25:59.381 --> 25:59.982
Which is good.

26:00.102 --> 26:03.727
Basically sustains American poetry in its own way.

26:04.729 --> 26:10.537
And they've had some great Jonathan Spence, Jerry Pelican.

26:11.839 --> 26:12.339
That's right.

26:12.360 --> 26:18.488
You see, the difference is that if we have a book that sells extremely well, it's because it's an extremely good book.

26:18.822 --> 26:27.970
you know, a serious book by a very intelligent person who's written essentially a scholarly book which crosses all the borders, all the frontiers.

26:28.991 --> 26:36.918
Whereas the trade press will often do a book which is not necessarily a good book, but it's by a celebrity author or a celebrity subject.

26:36.938 --> 26:40.541
And in theory, if somebody came to us offering a book like that, we would turn it down.

26:41.262 --> 26:47.007
You know, I mean, if Jackie Collins wanted to write about, you know, Hollywood children, you know.

26:47.442 --> 26:48.804
I mean, we would say no.

26:49.044 --> 26:52.008
Not only could we not afford to, but it wouldn't get through our committee.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.592
So what's the sniff test?

26:54.612 --> 26:55.994
What are you looking for?

26:56.494 --> 26:59.338
What, in your view, makes it... It's quality.

26:59.358 --> 27:00.640
And you know it when you see it?

27:00.660 --> 27:01.762
It's intellectual quality, yeah.

27:01.802 --> 27:13.398
I mean, I don't know whether this has come up in New Haven, but when Gore Vidal was... He wrote a book for us in our American Icon series about the Founding Fathers about two years ago.

27:13.618 --> 27:15.120
That sold very well, 100,000 copies.

27:15.556 --> 27:17.158
And Jonathan Brent was the author.

27:17.198 --> 27:21.525
But when he took it to the Committee on Publications of the U.S.

27:21.565 --> 27:23.607
faculty, they were sniffy about that.

27:24.589 --> 27:27.713
Does Gore Vidal cut the mustard?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.376
Is this book good enough?

27:29.436 --> 27:30.557
Does it have factual errors?

27:30.638 --> 27:32.060
Will we have egg on our face?

27:32.700 --> 27:34.803
And I was at that meeting, actually.

27:34.824 --> 27:36.406
It was quite interesting.

27:37.347 --> 27:42.795
Normally our committee just rubber stamps or proves and says, great book, great book.

27:42.815 --> 27:44.297
But that one was very dodgy.

27:44.800 --> 27:50.027
Well, do you think it was some sort of animus with Vidal as an individual?

27:50.167 --> 27:52.510
Maybe, but I think it was some of that.

27:52.550 --> 27:57.336
But also, you know, they were thinking, what is the role of a university press?

27:57.356 --> 27:59.779
If, I mean, Gord Vidal can get published by anyone.

28:00.520 --> 28:04.145
What we have to do is publish things... Probably for a lot more money, too, in fact.

28:04.165 --> 28:05.086
Yes, yes.

28:05.506 --> 28:07.990
And that, you know, that is quite a neat question.

28:08.090 --> 28:13.657
You know, should we do books that can perfectly well be done by somebody else?

28:14.077 --> 28:14.638
Should we...

28:15.074 --> 28:20.600
exercise our skills in making a very special scholarship available.

28:20.620 --> 28:24.524
And the truth is, if we did only that, it would be very hard to survive.

28:24.544 --> 28:29.850
So we have to bend sometimes and go for celebrities like Nick Bersbeck.

28:32.172 --> 28:36.036
Don't make me blush now.

28:37.538 --> 28:42.263
So what are some of your favorite Yale books?

28:42.698 --> 28:57.417
I tell you, there are some history books that have really won all the prizes.

28:57.548 --> 28:58.950
Oh, that's Thomas Cranmer.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.953
The thumping great history book.

29:01.013 --> 29:03.297
And that won loads of prizes here.

29:03.317 --> 29:04.538
This is Thomas Cranmer.

29:05.079 --> 29:06.281
Dermot McCulloch.

29:06.321 --> 29:08.464
D-I-A-R-M-A-I.

29:08.564 --> 29:11.228
For the sake of my tape, we've got a McCulloch.

29:11.769 --> 29:14.994
M-A-C-C-U-L-O-O-C-H.

29:15.014 --> 29:19.280
And that came out as quite a detailed historical biography.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.946
But because it's so good, it got huge reviews.

29:23.527 --> 29:25.550
It won trade prizes.

29:25.570 --> 29:27.032
It sold a lot of copies for us.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.092
You know, that's exactly what we do best.

29:29.352 --> 29:32.035
We take an unlikely book and make it work.

29:32.055 --> 29:33.156
About five pounds.

29:33.176 --> 29:35.138
Absolutely.

29:35.158 --> 29:36.339
Because it's good.

29:36.359 --> 29:40.523
I mean, that's, I think, is at the bottom of what we do, because it's good.

29:40.543 --> 29:54.397
You know what's emerging here, which is kind of fun, and when I come back again, I'll go over this stuff, and I'm hoping we can get together at a later time, and I can perhaps have some more focused questions.

29:54.978 --> 29:55.078
Sure.

29:56.240 --> 30:02.587
But this idea that Yale is really a British press, is that a stretch to suggest that?

30:02.667 --> 30:05.290
No, I mean, you mean Yale, London.

30:05.490 --> 30:06.992
That's what I mean, yeah.

30:07.012 --> 30:07.613
Well, it is.

30:08.313 --> 30:12.137
It's not just this outpost.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.000
No, it's not just an extension.

30:14.040 --> 30:25.352
Where Yale is out here fishing for titles to bring back under the big, I'm mixing my metaphors here, put under the big umbrella of Yale, it's really a very distinctive

30:25.670 --> 30:34.918
kind of a book that is cognizant of its readership here and the culture that's producing it.

30:35.258 --> 30:36.940
I think that's exactly it.

30:37.821 --> 30:41.143
We aren't just an outpost of New Haven.

30:41.223 --> 30:49.811
We are a sort of separately constituted, self-conscious publisher of our own with our own spirit.

30:49.871 --> 30:54.495
I mean, we are part of Yale, and we take that seriously, and we

30:55.032 --> 30:56.474
That is the reason we exist.

30:57.396 --> 31:05.027
But the books we do can be different in their nature and their character from the ones that New Heaven does.

31:05.308 --> 31:07.952
And they fit the list.

31:08.292 --> 31:10.155
We slot them into the overall list.

31:10.195 --> 31:18.228
See, generally, when a university press develops, I think, well, is it supposed to support the curriculum?

31:18.288 --> 31:20.972
You know, when someone thinks this is a university press,

31:21.678 --> 31:26.483
part of a university, although for half of its existence, Yale Press was a private company.

31:28.285 --> 31:30.067
It just had the Yale name.

31:30.747 --> 31:39.276
I mean, there was clearly a lot more to it than that, but for some years there was this sense that you at least had to support the curriculum.

31:39.777 --> 31:42.660
But you don't feel any obligation to do that over here?

31:43.841 --> 31:44.121
No.

31:44.582 --> 31:48.846
I mean, we... I mean, you're 3,400 miles away from the campus.

31:49.106 --> 31:49.727
That's right, yeah.

31:50.062 --> 32:01.617
No, we don't feel an obligation to produce Yale authors, but we do feel an obligation to reflect the best and the most advanced in the areas we publish.

32:01.637 --> 32:16.876
So I would see it as my obligation to find the best history writers at the very edge of their subject, you know, the people who are making real changes in research.

32:17.397 --> 32:19.680
But you know, the other interesting thing about Yale is that we...

32:20.487 --> 32:24.151
We don't do anything that other presses think makes money.

32:24.171 --> 32:25.733
I mean, we don't do textbooks.

32:26.794 --> 32:27.796
Well, not deliberately.

32:27.816 --> 32:29.778
Some of our books... We may have done some textbooks.

32:29.798 --> 32:33.542
Yeah, but they're not like McGraw-Hale, are they?

32:34.283 --> 32:42.913
I mean, they don't say, you know, World Civilization I. And we don't do professional things.

32:42.953 --> 32:44.255
We don't do law.

32:44.315 --> 32:45.937
We don't do medicine.

32:45.957 --> 32:46.798
We don't really do...

32:48.888 --> 32:50.050
business and economics.

32:50.090 --> 32:54.716
We don't do the things that most publishers make most of their money from.

32:55.537 --> 32:59.663
In one sense, it's crazy.

32:59.723 --> 33:03.408
We do all the things that nobody else can make work.

33:03.428 --> 33:06.713
It's harder to... Don't mind me.

33:08.235 --> 33:09.296
Taking pictures of everybody.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.403
My pictures are very good, by the way.

33:14.423 --> 33:15.024
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.

33:15.044 --> 33:18.709
Not to worry.

33:20.545 --> 33:22.407
I didn't mean to distract you.

33:22.427 --> 33:30.116
No, no, I was thinking about this because normally one gets on with one's job and answers the mail, you know, and then somebody comes and says, what's the special characteristic of your press?

33:30.437 --> 33:31.538
And it makes you think, really.

33:32.659 --> 33:38.106
And your statement that this is, to some extent, a British press in its feel is right.

33:42.270 --> 33:47.937
I mean, I go back to what I said at the beginning, that we, I think we have a more international

33:49.216 --> 33:51.558
take on things than New Haven.

33:51.578 --> 34:01.428
Because if we did books about the legal system in the UK or Tony Blair's New Labour Party, we wouldn't sell them.

34:01.448 --> 34:03.110
And certainly New Haven wouldn't sell them.

34:03.130 --> 34:06.273
I mean, they'd say, what are you bringing books like this?

34:06.654 --> 34:11.339
But they can bring a book about, you know, neocons and so on.

34:11.759 --> 34:15.142
Because they're Americans and it does well for them.

34:15.182 --> 34:17.705
Do they have veto power over the years?

34:17.725 --> 34:17.805
Yes.

34:17.825 --> 34:18.666
Well, they can...

34:18.916 --> 34:21.640
The Committee on Publications can always say no.

34:21.780 --> 34:27.128
And indeed, I guess John Donatage could say to us, no, I don't want that.

34:27.148 --> 34:32.796
But in practice, one would argue for one's own book.

34:32.816 --> 34:34.018
And they certainly have the confidence.

34:34.038 --> 34:36.842
I mean, you wouldn't have this position if they didn't trust your judgment.

34:36.902 --> 34:39.526
Yes, if they don't like my books, they can hire somebody else.

34:39.646 --> 34:47.337
I mean, clearly they have confidence in you to come in with...

34:47.502 --> 34:53.088
projects that you feel are going to kind of complement the list.

34:53.108 --> 35:04.339
I mean, as you know, for editors, it's your own sort of passion and hunger that enables you to find books, and then you have to sell that passion to your colleagues.

35:04.359 --> 35:13.107
And we all sit down at editorial meetings, and we phone in from the U.S., or vice versa, and we talk about the list and the books, and does something fit, and how's that going to do?

35:13.187 --> 35:14.809
So, you know, it's a joint thing.

35:15.987 --> 35:19.591
Are there any books that you wish you'd done?

35:19.611 --> 35:20.332
That I haven't?

35:20.352 --> 35:20.672
Yeah.

35:20.913 --> 35:21.253
God.

35:22.454 --> 35:22.795
Yes.

35:23.195 --> 35:24.076
I wish I could remember.

35:24.216 --> 35:25.618
I mean, there are always books like that.

35:25.658 --> 35:26.259
I mean, both.

35:26.299 --> 35:28.821
You see books in other people's lists that you think, you know, if only.

35:29.522 --> 35:36.430
And you see books that you miss, that you have a chance and you miss, and they go on to do very well, and you realize that you goofed.

35:38.172 --> 35:38.873
So I'm sure.

35:38.893 --> 35:39.934
But I can't think of anything.

35:39.954 --> 35:43.218
I can't think that I... So are you competing with the trade houses, do you think?

35:43.418 --> 35:43.598
Yeah.

35:44.658 --> 35:47.161
Yes, more so than with the other university presses.

35:48.904 --> 35:53.269
I'm not aware of competing with Oxford or Cambridge.

35:54.090 --> 35:59.317
Sometimes I'm aware of competing with Harvard or Princeton, say.

35:59.337 --> 36:04.123
I like Yale's list much better than Harvard's.

36:05.185 --> 36:06.987
Princeton has some nice things.

36:07.372 --> 36:08.293
I like Hopkins.

36:08.373 --> 36:10.577
I actually like Johns Hopkins.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.840
Yeah, Hopkins is a nice list.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.823
And we carry that list.

36:14.863 --> 36:23.336
You see, we have a representation company that sells books into the trade, which is wholly owned by Yale London, but is separate.

36:23.356 --> 36:27.382
And Kate Pocock, whom you've seen this afternoon, she's in charge of that, so she'll tell you.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.326
But amongst the lists we carry is Johns Hopkins.

36:30.506 --> 36:33.250
So we sell the books here.

36:33.471 --> 36:34.673
But no, we compete.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.674
I mean, I am competing.

36:36.143 --> 36:50.115
with Penguin Press, with HarperCollins, with Weinfeld and Nicholson, with Faber, with those kind of serious nonfiction publishers that can afford to pay good money for nonfiction authors.

36:50.515 --> 36:54.518
Now, are you still considered a non-profit entity?

36:54.659 --> 36:54.959
Yes.

36:55.159 --> 36:59.723
And that kind of has some complications, doesn't it, I think?

36:59.743 --> 36:59.983
Yes.

37:00.063 --> 37:02.045
I mean, here we say we're a charity.

37:02.085 --> 37:02.986
A charity, right.

37:03.006 --> 37:05.948
And we are a charity, so we don't pay tax on our profits.

37:06.772 --> 37:09.216
But then we don't make a whole lot of profit.

37:09.236 --> 37:11.819
Because if we did, we'd just plow it back into the box.

37:12.921 --> 37:14.443
Because we don't have any shareholders.

37:15.184 --> 37:19.210
So nobody's waiting to get money from us.

37:19.230 --> 37:24.357
I mean, obviously, if one makes a better margin one year, then you can pay your staff better.

37:24.378 --> 37:25.719
You can pay bigger advances.

37:25.739 --> 37:31.788
You can hire that picture researcher you've needed for years, but then they've been able to afford that sort of thing.

37:32.189 --> 37:34.592
But we aren't motivated by profit.

37:34.712 --> 37:36.475
We're motivated to

37:37.501 --> 37:45.530
pay our costs and to pay our authors properly and pay our bills properly, but we aren't motivated to have a big balance in the bank.

37:45.550 --> 37:53.559
Probably the successful university press of the 21st century will have to follow the Yale model, would you think?

37:54.279 --> 37:55.601
It has to have a business sense.

37:56.502 --> 37:59.445
It has to view the entire world as its market.

38:00.126 --> 38:07.474
I think the difference between us and other American universities is that they publish from and about the U.S.

38:08.129 --> 38:12.454
And Yale London means that we publish about the world, and we think about the world as a market.

38:12.475 --> 38:17.020
I mean, when we think about a book, we think, how's it going to sell in Australia or in South Africa?

38:18.222 --> 38:23.488
Because those markets are real for us, and we service them, and we have reps there.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.830
I mean, Oxford has always done this.

38:24.850 --> 38:27.253
They've published for the world, and they're hugely successful.

38:27.954 --> 38:30.918
But you take a press like California, I'm not sure that they do that.

38:31.879 --> 38:34.963
I take a look at their most recent list.

38:35.956 --> 38:41.424
I feel obligated to at least request a half a dozen titles off the checklist just to be decent.

38:41.504 --> 38:56.104
But the ones that really interested me, I can't even, so arcane and so really focused on California and gender issues, I would say.

38:56.224 --> 38:58.087
Birds of Southern California.

38:58.227 --> 39:00.771
Birds are on one bird thing after the other.

39:01.091 --> 39:02.513
Ecology, earthquakes.

39:03.635 --> 39:03.735
Yeah.

39:05.032 --> 39:05.553
That's right.

39:05.593 --> 39:11.826
I suppose, you know, or you go to New Mexico, it's, you know, Indians, or anything else, it's the Civil War.

39:12.307 --> 39:14.973
That's something that university presses do really well.

39:15.494 --> 39:20.003
They do their own locality in a very scholarly way.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.691
You know, the flora and fauna of Oklahoma.

39:23.711 --> 39:25.234
Yeah, but they also lose money.

39:25.518 --> 39:28.121
Yes, yes.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.523
But I bet those books lose less, actually.

39:31.124 --> 39:33.587
Well, because they stay on the backlist forever, too.

39:34.468 --> 39:36.490
They pay nothing to get them, probably.

39:36.510 --> 39:37.030
That's right.

39:37.551 --> 39:42.096
But I bet in the long term, those are the moneymakers for Oklahoma and Louisiana and stuff.

39:42.116 --> 39:43.437
It's the books about their own backyard.

39:43.457 --> 39:45.940
Louisiana does fiction, which is amazing.

39:45.960 --> 39:46.461
That's strange.

39:46.541 --> 39:47.722
I don't see how you can.

39:48.082 --> 39:48.663
But they do.

39:48.683 --> 39:50.745
They probably do half a dozen novels a year.

39:51.026 --> 39:51.967
Yes, I know.

39:52.107 --> 39:55.170
We say we don't deliberately.

39:55.555 --> 40:01.603
That's funny.

40:01.623 --> 40:02.043
Who knows?

40:02.524 --> 40:04.406
What do you think I need to pursue here?

40:04.486 --> 40:07.831
This is still, you know, I haven't started writing this thing yet.

40:07.871 --> 40:08.412
I'm ready to.

40:08.432 --> 40:20.367
I think I've got, basically for me, being invited to come in and to write something to celebrate and to observe the centennial.

40:20.407 --> 40:21.448
And I think it's going to be fun.

40:21.809 --> 40:23.571
I told John Donatich, I said,

40:24.209 --> 40:27.693
I love it that you only think this is going to sell 1,200 or 1,500 copies.

40:27.753 --> 40:28.514
I said, I'd be shocked.

40:29.575 --> 40:35.921
I know I sell 10,000 copies straight without one edit.

40:37.103 --> 40:43.349
HarperCollins, if there's anything that ticks me off about HarperCollins is that they don't do any publicity for me.

40:44.010 --> 40:45.351
Because you sell yourself.

40:45.371 --> 40:46.512
I sell myself.

40:47.353 --> 40:49.896
The first edition of my first printing of this

40:50.078 --> 40:54.602
My most recent book is 25,000 copies, and I think in three months we're close.

40:55.763 --> 40:56.224
Not bad.

40:56.584 --> 41:01.269
I don't know where it is, but in fact, Janice checked it for me at Yale.

41:01.289 --> 41:03.871
They normally don't tell you how you're doing.

41:03.911 --> 41:05.153
She looked it up on Bookscan.

41:05.173 --> 41:07.715
Yeah, don't tell anyone that she did this for me.

41:07.755 --> 41:08.175
Why not?

41:10.057 --> 41:11.819
She saw they were getting through the 25,000 copies.

41:11.859 --> 41:18.025
Well, no, they weren't at the 25,000, but they were halfway there, and that was two months ago, and I know it's still doing.

41:18.045 --> 41:18.145
Yeah.

41:18.260 --> 41:20.983
But, Nick, that's because you're a brand, aren't you?

41:21.504 --> 41:22.425
I am a brand, yeah.

41:22.845 --> 41:26.930
People who read you know the sorts of things you do.

41:26.970 --> 41:33.297
Yeah, but it hurts when there's somebody out in San Francisco that says, gee, I didn't know you had a new book out.

41:33.918 --> 41:35.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.241
People can't buy it if they don't know it's there.

41:37.261 --> 41:38.943
You know, they didn't send me out.

41:39.083 --> 41:40.044
They really cut back.

41:40.084 --> 41:43.108
And I don't blame them, honestly.

41:43.148 --> 41:47.693
It's cost an awful lot of money to send me from Boston to L.A.

41:47.926 --> 41:51.550
and just spend two or three days out there.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.191
I mean, that costs a lot of money.

41:53.652 --> 41:59.678
I can see it, but by the same token, you shouldn't measure it just by how many books you sell as signing it.

42:00.338 --> 42:06.585
They should regard your core readership as the base and then seek to extend it.

42:06.605 --> 42:17.055
Yeah, but I think that there's a... In fact, my editor at Harper's is Hugh Van Dusen, who's a famous name, and he's a lovely guy.

42:17.575 --> 42:20.862
And when he found out I was doing this project for Yale, he was so excited.

42:21.844 --> 42:23.106
He said, I can't wait to read.

42:23.307 --> 42:30.201
This is very friendly with the people at Yale.

42:30.367 --> 42:35.294
He said, you will be writing the first, I'm sure, but the first really good history of an American publisher.

42:35.454 --> 42:36.356
Because we haven't had one.

42:36.716 --> 42:36.776
No.

42:36.796 --> 42:39.400
They've all been just sort of duty for books.

42:39.420 --> 42:39.841
Boring.

42:40.021 --> 42:41.423
There's so many good stories here.

42:41.604 --> 42:41.904
Yeah.

42:41.924 --> 42:43.046
So many good story angles.

42:43.146 --> 42:47.592
And so I am always looking for the narrative.

42:47.612 --> 42:48.253
Yeah.

42:48.814 --> 42:51.478
I mean, obviously, it'll have to be chronological to an extent.

42:51.498 --> 42:52.620
To an extent.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.100
But not.

42:53.120 --> 42:53.902
Not necessarily.

42:53.922 --> 42:55.224
Not imprisoned by it.

42:55.464 --> 42:56.205
Oh, not at all.

42:56.911 --> 42:58.393
No, no, the stories are good.

42:58.753 --> 43:02.418
I mean, in a way, just as you are... This is a great story, by the way.

43:02.478 --> 43:04.881
This UK story is a major story.

43:04.901 --> 43:06.723
Because it's the only one of its kind.

43:06.843 --> 43:07.884
Yeah, it's great.

43:07.904 --> 43:11.709
And it's changed the Yale brand, really.

43:11.729 --> 43:12.310
Say that again?

43:12.330 --> 43:12.670
It's what?

43:12.851 --> 43:14.092
It's changed the Yale brand.

43:14.112 --> 43:14.733
That's what you said.

43:14.793 --> 43:16.275
Okay, that's what I thought you said.

43:17.216 --> 43:25.266
Because, I mean, I think that, just as you like Yale books, there are an awful lot of people out there who know a Yale book and sort of know what a Yale book represents.

43:26.047 --> 43:26.327
And...

43:26.780 --> 43:29.564
we have created our brand, we've created our reputation.

43:30.005 --> 43:40.221
And he has got, pardon my grief, but has balls, you know, I mean, they'll do things like the annals of communism or something.

43:40.241 --> 43:41.483
That's right, yeah, yes.

43:41.623 --> 43:48.193
You know, it's a gutsy, fun thing to do, and it's been wildly successful.

43:48.834 --> 43:54.002
And, you know, it requires political courage, because...

43:54.353 --> 43:58.059
It's taking a political line, in a way.

43:58.079 --> 44:11.699
Yeah, I mean, I think we do, in that phrase, think outside the box, and we're not trapped by a scholarly convention, but at the same time, we don't do things that are crazy.

44:11.719 --> 44:19.671
I mean, everything we do has to be read by one or two outside readers who have substance.

44:19.951 --> 44:23.837
Because, yeah, there's a big

44:24.155 --> 44:27.840
an expensive name, and we don't want anyone to say, why is Yale doing that?

44:27.860 --> 44:28.601
I mean, sometimes you do.

44:28.621 --> 44:31.104
You publish a book, and a review says, why is Yale doing this?

44:31.425 --> 44:33.007
And you think, oh, God, that's bad.

44:33.427 --> 44:34.469
Well, the Vinland map.

44:35.069 --> 44:40.176
Yeah, well, that's, well, John Ryden will have told you about that story, won't he?

44:40.196 --> 44:42.780
They've all said to me, what are you going to do with the Vinland map?

44:42.820 --> 44:43.921
I said, I've got to report it.

44:44.141 --> 44:44.362
Come on.

44:44.382 --> 44:45.283
Yeah, that's a good story.

44:45.303 --> 44:46.084
It's a good story.

44:46.124 --> 44:47.426
Don't be ashamed of it.

44:47.466 --> 44:48.387
It's a fun story.

44:48.407 --> 44:49.428
It's a good story.

44:49.448 --> 44:52.913
But, no, whether or not you keep insisting that it's

44:53.197 --> 44:56.662
authentic, that's another thing.

44:56.682 --> 44:58.104
But what's wrong with that?

44:58.164 --> 44:59.145
It's fun.

45:00.027 --> 45:00.507
Sure.

45:00.547 --> 45:01.288
What's wrong with it?

45:01.328 --> 45:03.532
You can't get everything right.

45:03.552 --> 45:06.416
I love the story of how they got Long Day's Journey into Night.

45:07.237 --> 45:08.479
I don't think I know that.

45:08.499 --> 45:20.395
Well, Bennett Cerf was O'Neill's editor for Random House, but he promised Eugene O'Neill that he wouldn't publish that play for 50 years.

45:20.435 --> 45:22.258
It was so fiercely autobiographical.

45:22.458 --> 45:26.102
And, of course, there was honor in publishing back in those days, and he died.

45:27.424 --> 45:33.011
But then the widow said, well, I think we can.

45:33.371 --> 45:34.613
This is something that's pretty good.

45:35.253 --> 45:47.708
So Yale was under no obligation not to do it, and because the materials had gone to the Yale Library, they published it, and it's a million-seller, you know, and everything wins a Pulitzer Prize.

45:47.768 --> 45:50.372
And Bennett says, I can't.

45:50.432 --> 45:52.414
I promised Gene I wouldn't do it.

45:52.681 --> 45:56.747
So Yale had no such compunction?

45:56.767 --> 45:58.028
None.

45:58.169 --> 46:00.772
And they published, you know, three other plays after that.

46:03.296 --> 46:04.938
It's a pretty interesting story.

46:04.958 --> 46:08.162
So I'm trying to find a correspondence that documents that.

46:08.182 --> 46:08.883
Yeah, of course.

46:09.244 --> 46:10.466
This is unprecedented for me.

46:10.486 --> 46:16.234
I mean, they've given me a graduate student to help with their research.

46:16.294 --> 46:17.535
I've never had anything.

46:17.796 --> 46:19.498
I don't even know how to do it.

46:20.423 --> 46:21.665
How to instruct her, you know?

46:21.945 --> 46:26.512
I'm used to doing all my own work and checking out.

46:26.532 --> 46:29.537
So where are Yale New Haven's archives?

46:29.797 --> 46:31.560
Are they in the basement of that building?

46:31.580 --> 46:40.974
No, actually, a lot of the things are in the Beinecke, and most of them are in Sterling Library, especially the correspondence and things like that.

46:40.994 --> 46:44.119
Yeah, because publishers' archives are wonderful.

46:44.139 --> 46:44.400
Yeah, really.

46:44.460 --> 46:45.942
All these correspondents are great authors.

46:47.356 --> 46:49.398
The University of Texas has tons of them.

46:49.579 --> 46:50.340
I'm sure, yeah.

46:50.360 --> 46:51.641
Thank God somebody's keeping them.

46:51.661 --> 46:55.225
Yeah, the Lilly Library has a lot of them, too.

46:55.285 --> 47:02.894
I mean, you sit here as an editor, and over the years letters come from Isaiah Berlin and others, and you think, oh, this is my file, you know.

47:03.715 --> 47:04.496
That's great stuff.

47:05.077 --> 47:06.198
I just hope it survives.

47:07.540 --> 47:16.350
So if you were to give me some guidance on where you would like to see something like this go, what would you like to know about Yale?

47:16.769 --> 47:30.464
Well, I mean, I am interested in the international dynamic and the relationship between the two offices, because I think that's special.

47:31.465 --> 47:35.910
Who else do you think I should talk to here on a future trip?

47:38.693 --> 47:43.418
There's a woman called Stephanie Sutton, who predated John Nichol, who was here as a

47:43.803 --> 47:44.504
She's still around.

47:44.604 --> 47:45.486
Yeah, she's still around.

47:45.506 --> 47:50.715
She's an Austrian, and she worked with Chester very closely.

47:50.735 --> 47:52.518
So Stephanie would be... So she'd know Chester.

47:52.838 --> 47:54.200
Oh, yes.

47:54.220 --> 47:56.685
Getting Chester perceptions are hard.

47:56.925 --> 47:58.107
Yeah, I didn't know Chester.

47:58.127 --> 48:01.352
I mean, I saw him, but I didn't work here when he was a director.

48:01.413 --> 48:08.344
I mean, he seemed more English than English, to some extent.

48:08.364 --> 48:08.865
Sharp problems.

48:09.132 --> 48:15.540
That's right, absolutely.

48:16.341 --> 48:17.563
So she worked for Chester.

48:17.763 --> 48:21.668
She worked for Chester, yes, in the sales office here.

48:22.429 --> 48:32.022
And Chester used to come, I gather, by, you know, announce his arrival and stay at the Savoy or carriages and have audiences with people.

48:32.042 --> 48:34.165
I mean, this was the grand old stuff.

48:34.185 --> 48:38.110
And I think he quite liked it that when John Nichol came, he, um,

48:38.275 --> 48:52.776
John's great success was a book called Life in the English Country House by Mark Gerard, which of course is, it's a glorious book, but it's about the lifestyles of the rich and famous.

48:52.796 --> 48:54.759
It has a certain snob element, but it's a beautiful book.

48:54.779 --> 48:56.521
It's a very, very successful book.

48:56.581 --> 48:59.946
Yeah, it's one of our most successful books from this office.

49:00.466 --> 49:01.467
And John was responsible.

49:01.527 --> 49:04.511
Didn't they do Cut in the Web of Words early on, too?

49:04.691 --> 49:05.812
Yeah, that's right.

49:05.852 --> 49:07.334
Which is a great book.

49:07.354 --> 49:09.977
I love that book.

49:09.997 --> 49:11.098
That's a nice book.

49:11.158 --> 49:14.742
You'd think that would have been done by Oxford Press, you know?

49:14.963 --> 49:20.930
Yes, you see, John, I think, met the daughter, who wrote it.

49:20.950 --> 49:25.295
I mean, all publishing connections are serendipitous, aren't they?

49:25.875 --> 49:30.000
And it's to do with connections and ideas and who you like.

49:30.267 --> 49:32.290
You do have to publish books by people you like.

49:32.350 --> 49:35.374
You can't publish books by people you don't like.

49:35.414 --> 49:38.278
You can't work with publishers you don't like.

49:38.498 --> 49:50.755
When I was writing a weekly column, you know, 20 years, and there was always an interview with a major author, and people would say to me, how come you always like these books?

49:50.975 --> 49:51.856
I mean, why don't you ever know?

49:51.876 --> 49:55.381
I said, what do you expect me to choose somebody I don't like?

49:55.601 --> 49:56.983
I'm going to waste my time if I...

49:57.149 --> 50:03.175
a book I don't want to read or spend an afternoon talking to an author who bores me?

50:03.255 --> 50:05.858
I mean, what's the point, right?

50:05.898 --> 50:11.704
You have to like the person or the work that you're dealing with.

50:11.825 --> 50:21.655
The other thing that I'd like to know, and I don't know the answer to this, is to what extent Yale Press represents or

50:22.293 --> 50:26.097
epitomizes Yale as a university within U.S.

50:26.117 --> 50:29.761
society, and how different it is from Harvard and Princeton and Chicago.

50:30.842 --> 50:35.167
To what extent does the character of the university determine the sort of press it is?

50:36.588 --> 50:37.650
Or maybe it doesn't.

50:38.350 --> 50:41.554
Well, it didn't for a while, I think.

50:43.015 --> 50:44.117
Which I find very interesting.

50:44.137 --> 50:46.519
Gaddis Smith, who's doing a history of Yale.

50:47.140 --> 50:47.580
Right, is he?

50:48.661 --> 50:49.863
A major history of Yale.

50:49.883 --> 50:51.945
He's been working on it for years and years.

50:52.448 --> 50:55.153
One thing he is not including is the press.

50:56.014 --> 51:02.685
And I interviewed him and he said, so he gave me a couple of things that he'd really like to see done.

51:02.825 --> 51:06.331
And I said, well, how come you're not doing that?

51:06.351 --> 51:08.835
He said, well, for many years it wasn't part of the university.

51:09.577 --> 51:13.563
And he said, for many years it was also a political organ.

51:13.664 --> 51:18.692
They published the kinds of things that would be unheard of today.

51:18.959 --> 51:24.365
very conservative things, anti-Rosevelt, FDR things, polemical things.

51:27.468 --> 51:33.315
You know, you just would never, and if they gave me a couple titles years ago, take a look at these.

51:34.116 --> 51:34.576
Really?

51:34.616 --> 51:36.779
Not to embarrass anybody, but it's part of the history.

51:37.440 --> 51:37.660
Yeah, sure.

51:37.680 --> 51:40.463
You know, I mean, this is how the thing evolved.

51:42.385 --> 51:44.207
But it kind of,

51:45.200 --> 51:47.563
It plays into what you're suggesting.

51:47.644 --> 52:13.401
For me, I'm not American, so I don't know quite what the universities represent within American culture, but I look at Harvard's books and they're very controlled, very intellectual, sometimes wonderful, classy product, but small groups, fewer of them and more contained, more self-conscious.

52:13.617 --> 52:24.451
first started revealing books and getting the catalogs from university presses, it was amazing how many books sounded so wonderful by their title and what they purported to be doing.

52:25.352 --> 52:41.093
And then you get the book and they're so filled with jargon, they're so uninvitingly written, boring, you know, and I think one of the things I've always liked about Yale books is that there is an attempt

52:41.478 --> 52:46.162
to engage a reader outside of the immediate circle of the writer.

52:48.565 --> 52:58.194
I think the Yale staff, people such as yourself, have some sort of feeling for the generalists out there.

52:58.454 --> 53:03.639
Yes, we do, absolutely, and deliberately we do.

53:03.659 --> 53:05.841
And you see such wonderful subjects.

53:06.842 --> 53:09.865
I've gotten so many good ideas that I've used

53:10.469 --> 53:14.474
or material, you know, properly cited and everything like that, but it's boring.

53:14.594 --> 53:19.360
I mean, the way it's been produced, not your books, but, you know, some of it.

53:19.400 --> 53:24.326
But Nick, then, why would someone like you not publish with us?

53:24.346 --> 53:33.517
I mean, would your agent not sell you to us because we couldn't afford you or because you wouldn't think we could sell enough?

53:34.798 --> 53:36.100
I make my living as a writer.

53:36.140 --> 53:38.102
Sure, yeah.

53:38.122 --> 53:38.923
Sure, but I mean,

53:39.865 --> 53:42.409
My agent actually advised against doing this book.

53:42.869 --> 53:43.310
Really?

53:43.470 --> 53:43.790
Yeah.

53:43.810 --> 53:47.876
I shouldn't have practice on the tape.

53:48.257 --> 53:51.101
And I actually did the contract with Yale.

53:51.541 --> 53:52.242
Directly?

53:52.262 --> 53:52.783
Directly.

53:52.803 --> 53:53.364
I see.

53:53.384 --> 53:56.188
Because the agent saw it was not going to be a money-making thing.

53:56.208 --> 53:59.893
Well, I live 90 minutes from New Haven.

53:59.913 --> 54:00.013
Yeah.

54:00.033 --> 54:09.366
And I'm between books, trade books, and I didn't want to fall too hard in the heels of this one

54:09.852 --> 54:16.962
with the next one, and I want to think about what I want to do, and my wife loves Yale.

54:16.982 --> 54:19.385
That matters.

54:19.565 --> 54:24.392
And this will throw up things that might generate other ideas for you.

54:24.532 --> 54:30.540
I like the idea of doing a book for Yale.

54:31.962 --> 54:33.384
It is cool.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.868
It's really nice.

54:35.888 --> 54:39.673
At my age, I'll be 63 in a couple of weeks.

54:40.092 --> 54:42.054
to have a Yale title.

54:42.815 --> 54:43.996
And that, you know, it'll look good.

54:44.557 --> 54:54.167
It will look very good, and it's also, I love, I love doing things that has such low expectations.

54:54.988 --> 55:00.474
Don't quote me on this, but I know what... You can surprise people.

55:00.494 --> 55:01.475
I can surprise people.

55:01.515 --> 55:03.877
My first book, nobody in New York wanted to publish it.

55:03.937 --> 55:06.680
I mean, the first printing was 5,800 copies.

55:06.740 --> 55:09.323
It's got 120,000 copies in print now, you know.

55:09.860 --> 55:10.741
Nobody wanted it.

55:11.121 --> 55:13.223
It was out there for 13 months before Holt.

55:15.165 --> 55:21.031
The feeling was, who's interested in a book about bibliomaniacs, which is what A Gentle Madness was all about.

55:21.091 --> 55:25.796
I said, well, other bibliomaniacs might be interested in it.

55:25.816 --> 55:34.565
But anyway, the expectations for it were... Even Holt put it at the back of the catalog, half a page.

55:34.605 --> 55:36.407
It was just one of these things that...

55:36.961 --> 55:43.907
To this day, 11 years after it's published, it has only been one ad bought for that book.

55:43.927 --> 55:48.191
It was a little two-column drop-in in the New York Review of Books for Christmas 1995.

55:49.152 --> 55:51.875
And other than that, it just had wonderful reviews.

55:53.416 --> 55:54.017
It did very well.

55:54.097 --> 56:02.545
But if a press is publishing 25,000 copies, they must surely back that up with some sort of marketing thing.

56:02.565 --> 56:05.027
I mean, if they don't, you're an absolute gem.

56:05.497 --> 56:06.739
Well, I'll tell you.

56:06.799 --> 56:12.866
It's without a great deal of effort for us.

56:12.886 --> 56:18.333
Well, that's what they figure, you know, that my library sales are terrific.

56:18.353 --> 56:19.695
Yeah, I bet they are.

56:19.715 --> 56:21.998
This new book is called Every Book It's Reader.

56:22.579 --> 56:23.620
Yeah, right.

56:23.660 --> 56:27.685
And that's one of S. N. Ranganathan, the Indian library scientist.

56:27.705 --> 56:31.390
He had five cardinal rules of libraries.

56:31.710 --> 56:34.474
The reader's time is precious.

56:35.062 --> 56:36.283
Books are for use.

56:36.964 --> 56:40.087
The library is a growing organism that's like science fiction.

56:40.127 --> 56:56.344
How do you pronounce your name?

56:56.404 --> 56:57.706
Nicole, Nick, Nickel.

56:58.126 --> 56:59.528
Okay, good.

56:59.548 --> 57:03.752
I'm just going to put that right there.

57:04.002 --> 57:09.289
Actually, it's going too fast.

57:09.309 --> 57:10.791
Very flattering things.

57:10.811 --> 57:17.039
Right, so it hits the market it's intended for, but then the publisher's job is to extend that market.

57:17.099 --> 57:18.961
I think they're happy with what they get.

57:19.602 --> 57:25.269
Well, not many people do 25,000 copies just like that.

57:25.770 --> 57:27.932
Raise your demands next time.

57:28.513 --> 57:30.696
Well, it's one of the reasons that the Yale thing is good.

57:31.777 --> 57:33.199
It's allowing me to...

57:33.702 --> 57:39.693
I think my next book's going to be a lot more commercial in any way, in any case.

57:39.713 --> 57:45.062
I think it's a fabulous idea, but I haven't pitched it yet, we'll see.

57:45.102 --> 57:46.024
Right, it's a secret.

57:46.725 --> 57:49.931
Well, you won't go and hire somebody to do it.

57:49.951 --> 57:50.612
I won't, no.

57:50.632 --> 57:52.055
Well, you'll know.

57:52.175 --> 57:53.097
No, I swear.

57:53.498 --> 57:54.900
Well, I think...
