Now, $138, $550, $650, $650, $650,

26:06.571 --> 26:09.657
$630.

26:09.677 --> 26:11.620
And $139.00.

26:13.203 --> 26:27.550
$1,000.

26:34.043 --> 26:41.249
Not 140 dual fan manuscripts.

26:42.133 --> 26:45.505
It started at $10,000.

26:47.122 --> 27:13.045
$10,000, $11,000, $12,000, $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, $15,000, $15,000, $15,000, $17,000, $18,000, $19,000, $20,000, $20,000, $21,000, and $21,000, $22,000, $23,000, $23,000, $24,000, $25,000, $25,000

27:13.565 --> 27:31.182
$48,000, $29,000, $30,000, $32,000, $35,000, $38,000, $40,000, $42,000, $35,000.

27:31.202 --> 27:41.091
$45,000.

27:55.178 --> 28:24.055
Well, 141, the price has revisited, $1,500 less, $1,500, $1,800, $2,000, $3,000, $3,000, $4,000, $4,000, $4,000, $4,800, $4,800, $4,800

28:34.143 --> 28:47.765
But, lot 142, the autograph manuscript will follow the volumes, lot 142.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.250
Should we pay $50,000 for this?

28:51.270 --> 28:53.113
$50,000?

28:53.233 --> 29:01.967
$50,000.

29:02.476 --> 29:05.960
$8,000, $85,000.

29:05.980 --> 29:15.130
Here against you at $85,000, $85,000, $90,000 on the cell phone.

29:15.330 --> 29:20.376
At $90,000, $95,000 against you on the cell phone.

29:20.636 --> 29:22.578
$95,000.

29:22.598 --> 29:23.579
At $95,000, $100,000 on the cell phone.

29:23.599 --> 29:24.660
$100,000 on the cell phone.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.024
At $100,000, the cell phone says $100,000 at $100,000.

29:28.044 --> 29:29.466
Any more than $100,000?

29:29.486 --> 29:31.588
The cell phone says $100,000 off.

29:33.492 --> 29:54.778
Thank you very much.

29:54.798 --> 29:56.580
Lot 143, .

29:57.100 --> 30:22.028
Three bits on this now, $15,000, $15,000, $15,000, $15,000, $17,000, $17,000, $18,000, $18,000

30:30.783 --> 30:51.593
uh

30:57.277 --> 31:01.549
about 145.

31:02.423 --> 31:16.464
$850, $950, $1,000, $1,000, $1,200, $1,200, $1,200, $1,400, $1,600, $1,800, $2,000.

31:16.484 --> 31:25.497
At $2,000, $2,200, $2,400, $2,600, $2,600.

31:25.517 --> 31:25.877
At $2,600, $2,600.

31:25.897 --> 31:26.258
At $2,600, $2,600.

31:26.278 --> 31:29.663
At $2,600.

31:31.297 --> 31:40.627
I've got 146.

31:41.007 --> 31:43.730
Let's probably direct it.

31:43.750 --> 32:00.949
$2,000, $2,000, $2,200, $25,000, $28,000, $3,000, $3,000, $3,200, $3,500, $3,800, $4,000, $4,000, $4,000, $4,000

32:06.802 --> 32:09.403
Not a lot of concern

32:11.408 --> 32:14.832
$4,200.

32:14.852 --> 32:16.634
$5,500.

32:16.654 --> 32:20.078
$5,500.

32:20.118 --> 32:37.399
$55.

32:42.695 --> 33:01.345
880

33:02.962 --> 33:28.345
Law 149, 512, 650, 650, 750, 850, 950, 1,000, 1,000, 1,200, 1,200, 1,200, 1,200, 1,200.

33:35.041 --> 33:40.147
$1,300 now.

33:40.207 --> 33:41.529
$1,400.

33:41.969 --> 33:43.751
$1,400.

33:43.831 --> 33:45.613
$1,400.

33:45.633 --> 34:00.711
$1,400.

34:06.901 --> 34:35.828
$4,500.

34:36.432 --> 34:57.647
The material is quite fresh on the market and there's no enormous interest over here in

34:58.420 --> 35:20.125
the french office generally i suppose probably wasn't him it must be the kind of well he uses uh mr wilmer that's for texas and lake often buys it in buys it in cars there's a big sale in paris to say you think he was trying this is just a guess yeah and there's also been a lot of a lot of material out this year the sales coming up there's more gene sales coming up there's martin

35:20.105 --> 35:21.767
There's a Christie sale tomorrow.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.048
I can't make tomorrow.

35:23.068 --> 35:24.170
Yeah.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.934
Well, I don't think I can give you a fee there, but I'll see you next week.

35:27.954 --> 35:28.454
Yeah, good.

35:28.655 --> 35:29.496
Okay, Nick.

35:29.516 --> 35:30.757
Thank you very much.

35:30.997 --> 35:32.279
Appreciate it.

35:32.739 --> 35:33.260
Okay, take care.

35:40.508 --> 35:49.318
We'll see you next week.

36:01.060 --> 36:30.173
I'm talking to Nancy.

36:48.142 --> 36:49.124
Thank you.

36:57.676 --> 37:17.091
I know.

37:17.111 --> 37:17.672
I've seen them this morning.

37:17.692 --> 37:18.133
Oh, they're preparing.

37:18.153 --> 37:18.634
Yeah, they're preparing.

37:18.654 --> 37:18.915
That's right.

37:18.935 --> 37:19.195
I don't know.

37:19.175 --> 38:51.093
[Crowd murmuring.]

38:51.093 --> 39:13.253
and it's

39:13.233 --> 39:31.242
I'd love to

39:31.222 --> 39:54.162
And then we'll be there where he is.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.946
And then we try and keep talking, but we don't want to have, like, humination structure.

39:55.966 --> 39:56.166
It's good.

39:56.146 --> 40:14.128
That's right.

40:14.148 --> 40:14.909
You're never going to write your book?

40:14.929 --> 40:15.110
Yes, sir.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.752
My editor asked me to say, you know, I said, you did.

40:16.772 --> 40:18.253
Say you have your fine-sized brother around, but it depends on your money.

40:18.273 --> 40:18.434
Why not?

40:18.454 --> 40:19.014
I think they didn't post it.

40:19.034 --> 40:19.555
Why are you going to do...

40:19.535 --> 40:26.375
Please be scared, by the way.

40:26.395 --> 40:26.878
Please keep inviting me.

40:27.061 --> 40:47.051
One never knows who might need it.

40:47.071 --> 40:48.753
Well, we don't have the interface quite regularly if we don't have a nice major set.

40:48.773 --> 40:49.755
If only we have a major set, that helps build it.

40:49.775 --> 40:50.335
Which is really fascinating.

40:50.355 --> 40:50.716
I believe in that.

40:50.736 --> 40:51.257
Well, we like to see that.

40:51.277 --> 40:51.858
I'm doing a piece of regular.

40:51.878 --> 40:52.719
You see where the New York Times exploded?

40:52.739 --> 40:53.440
I've told people it was Christie's.

40:53.420 --> 40:59.846
I mean, you read the first paragraph.

41:00.446 --> 41:06.912
No, no, but the first paragraph is one of the... You have to read the first paragraph in the background.

41:06.932 --> 41:17.622
It says that if you talk to Michael Ainsley, who's the president of the 70s, he'll say that if you want to film... That's a very interesting paragraph.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.684
Yeah, if you want to film wine, you'll tell it to Christie's.

41:19.704 --> 41:23.207
You know, if you talk to Charlie Oldstock, who's the chairman of Christie's, he will tell you if you want to sell books and sell them to the 70s.

41:23.187 --> 41:40.076
I would say that on the record period.

41:40.096 --> 41:41.879
Well, there's a French Coke sale, but... Well, I was happy to come off it, too, recently.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.121
Well, right on the record period is so fresh from the market.

41:43.141 --> 41:43.542
It's a little crazy.

41:43.522 --> 42:04.089
Well, actually, fresh on the market actually means something else.

42:04.109 --> 42:05.731
Fresh on the market means that it hasn't been seen for years and years and years.

42:05.751 --> 42:06.112
No, of course not.

42:06.132 --> 42:08.896
I mean, if you look at the provenance, you'll see that many of the items that are bought, they're all bought this decade.

42:08.916 --> 42:09.697
Some of them recently is 1985 and 1985.

42:09.717 --> 42:10.778
So, that involves saying that facetiously, of course.

42:10.758 --> 42:32.648
I mean, he must be.

42:32.668 --> 42:33.009
I don't think so.

42:33.029 --> 42:33.329
Well, I'll say.

42:33.349 --> 42:33.810
I'm sure it's an issue.

42:33.830 --> 42:34.591
You know, do you know Steve Wasserman?

42:34.611 --> 42:34.791
Yes, sir.

42:34.771 --> 42:51.563
Yeah, you probably know more people than I do.

42:51.583 --> 42:51.903
Hi, how are you?

42:51.923 --> 42:52.244
Nice to see you.

42:52.264 --> 42:52.464
Thank you.

42:52.484 --> 42:53.005
Do you know Nick Bradford?

42:53.025 --> 42:53.366
Very interesting.

42:53.386 --> 42:53.927
Um, but it's, um, very sad.

42:53.907 --> 43:05.065
I bet you have a few aces in the hall.

43:05.085 --> 43:12.237
Sorry, that's the one thing I've never been to do.

43:12.217 --> 43:30.169
We really did.

43:30.189 --> 43:30.469
We really did.

43:30.489 --> 43:31.491
But it was an opportunity for getting good people.

43:31.471 --> 44:00.347
You know, Nick is writing a book about a rotten book collector.

44:00.367 --> 44:00.748
Are you going back?

44:00.768 --> 44:00.988
Absolutely.

44:00.968 --> 44:19.759
I try to be here.

44:19.779 --> 44:20.720
I keep the paper and I never take the quarters.

44:20.740 --> 44:21.241
I don't keep her running.

44:21.261 --> 44:21.602
Do you ever turn?

44:21.622 --> 44:21.762
I will.

44:21.742 --> 44:43.632
uh...

44:43.612 --> 44:57.205
Yes, I think we did.

44:57.225 --> 44:59.089
Actually, I don't remember what I said because I don't have my favorite quarter running ever.

44:59.069 --> 45:15.259
No, I'm sure you'll come up with it.

45:15.279 --> 45:17.162
If I were you, I would have had my resignation on your desk that morning, that Monday morning.

45:17.142 --> 45:37.799
The person who wrote that article was a very good friend of Mr. Elkhoff.

45:37.819 --> 45:39.522
And he, at that point, Mr. Elkhoff actually took the Dotea manuscript sale in London.

45:39.542 --> 45:39.943
So he knew that that

45:39.923 --> 45:49.066
It's not exactly your yard yard.

45:49.086 --> 45:49.447
It's a block yard.

45:49.467 --> 45:51.112
I figured that it was somebody who had a bone.

45:51.132 --> 45:53.297
I mean, I don't know what your wine department is like.

45:53.317 --> 45:55.182
I don't know what your wine department is like.

45:55.162 --> 46:17.813
I mean, you know, that was not, I know nothing about it, but I did know that both book departments are alive and well, at least I thought they were.

46:17.833 --> 46:18.094
No, I wasn't.

46:18.114 --> 46:18.254
Was it?

46:18.274 --> 46:18.334
No.

46:18.314 --> 46:41.061
Well, a lot of those things.

46:41.081 --> 46:41.862
And a lot of collectors are doing this.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.724
A lot of those people bought so recently that the prices are engraved in the people's heads.

46:43.744 --> 46:44.285
And the collector wants it.

46:44.305 --> 46:44.806
It's like that Rembrandt.

46:44.826 --> 46:45.166
That was amazing.

46:45.186 --> 46:46.187
Because that really has been bought two years ago.

46:46.207 --> 46:46.768
Two years ago from a dealer.

46:46.748 --> 47:03.638
You are insane.

47:03.658 --> 47:06.163
And I hate to do that with investors because, you know, the investor invariably says to me, well, will this appreciate value?

47:06.183 --> 47:08.326
And I've said, well, will your stockbroker tell you that this will appreciate value and guarantee anything?

47:08.346 --> 47:08.567
No, no, no.

47:08.587 --> 47:08.827
I hate that.

47:08.847 --> 47:09.769
But co-workers have been buying very recently.

47:09.749 --> 47:26.900
But also, I mean, obviously, Brett Kemp was by a very specialized experience, and he was mine.

47:26.920 --> 47:27.081
Exactly.

47:27.101 --> 47:27.341
He was mine.

47:27.361 --> 47:27.461
Yeah.

47:27.481 --> 47:27.842
He gave you a lot.

47:27.822 --> 47:54.221
Yeah, I wouldn't do it now.

47:54.241 --> 47:55.483
Well, she is... She might, but... In her background, she is...

47:55.463 --> 48:25.470
Because the collection represents your house in a really tangible way.

48:25.450 --> 48:30.562
Yes, they were.

48:30.963 --> 48:32.105
They were.

48:32.185 --> 48:40.204
They actually had discussions with a number of institutions about it.

48:40.224 --> 48:40.725
Did you have a chat with

48:40.705 --> 48:45.470
And where does that end?

48:45.490 --> 49:02.007
It was interesting, they got close to one institution, and that institution really wanted the endowment to give them all their questions.

49:02.028 --> 49:07.253
I mean, institutions are sometimes very sorry.

49:07.233 --> 49:21.777
And everyone I've talked to, by the way, and this will be in the book, because, you know, where would we be without collectors?

49:21.797 --> 49:25.944
Well, I mean, I think that's very, but not even where would we be without collectors.

49:25.964 --> 49:28.328
Where would collectors be without great books to buy?

49:28.348 --> 49:32.194
The collectors argue that they care for better than this is because

49:32.174 --> 49:40.789
Well, there's a lot to be said to that.

49:41.090 --> 49:44.716
And also, this is about somebody being bought and then hidden away forever.

49:44.736 --> 49:47.681
It's kind of alarming, actually, because it's like the tubes of it, and end up, so many of them hidden away.

49:48.122 --> 49:51.668
It's as though sometimes, when we hear about it in the press, it's as though

49:51.648 --> 50:06.427
We've got a close-up or something.

50:06.447 --> 50:08.971
We're going to bring the people.

50:08.991 --> 50:09.151
Bye-bye.

50:09.171 --> 50:09.331
Bye-bye.

50:09.351 --> 50:09.431
Yes.

50:09.451 --> 50:12.696
There's Kit Karey in here.

50:12.716 --> 50:13.296
Do you know who Kit Karey is?

50:13.316 --> 50:13.377
No.

50:13.397 --> 50:13.717
That's his wife.

50:13.737 --> 50:15.259
And she is one of the experts on Asian crafts.

50:15.239 --> 50:43.745
All right.

50:43.765 --> 50:44.385
Well, why don't you, I'm sorry.

50:44.405 --> 50:44.485
Yes.

50:44.505 --> 50:45.066
Well, you've got that great.

50:45.086 --> 50:45.246
Curator.

50:45.226 --> 51:46.018
We're here in Minnesota.

51:46.018 --> 51:13.998
[Crowd murmuring.]

51:13.998 --> 51:20.974
If I want to bid on a book at Monaco, what would I do?

51:21.555 --> 51:25.504
I'm having a sale.

51:26.185 --> 51:30.054
It's not something that simple.

51:30.154 --> 51:33.542
It's not something that I'm going to buy for myself.

51:34.000 --> 52:28.487
[Crowd murmuring.]

52:28.467 --> 52:48.298
specifically what i want to talk about

52:48.278 --> 53:29.322
[Crowd murmuring.]

53:29.875 --> 53:35.504
Well, it is.

53:36.225 --> 53:50.566
The last week of June, the first week of July, I'm going to be terminated, and I'm going to prepare a couple of lectures, one for next week and then one for the week after, and I'm really going to be.

53:50.586 --> 53:51.608
But after that, I will be free after July.

53:51.628 --> 53:52.309
So, give me a call.

53:52.329 --> 53:52.810
My name is Nick.

53:52.830 --> 53:52.930
Yeah.

53:52.910 --> 54:15.598
I work by spelling much better.

54:15.618 --> 54:16.379
I'm just starting the mortgage anyway.

54:16.399 --> 54:16.639
How are you?

54:16.619 --> 54:36.541
He keeps doing a book on here.

54:36.561 --> 54:41.486
He gets into my American golden age.

54:42.067 --> 54:47.323
I can tell you guys one question, how about your name?

54:47.343 --> 54:48.128
Nicholas Parker has chosen a new one.

54:48.479 --> 55:16.545
The preceding was a tape-recorded

55:17.150 --> 55:28.403
Series of conversations at the reception at Sotheby's on Monday, June 11, 1990, for the Bradley Martin sale.

55:28.884 --> 55:31.767
I just did an experiment tipping in my pocket.

55:31.787 --> 55:33.009
One hopes that it came out well.

55:35.912 --> 55:38.415
Bradley Martin, $130,000 is all working.

55:39.205 --> 55:59.779
$150,000, $150,000, $170,000, $180,000, $180,000, $190,000, $230,000, $230,000, $240,000, $250,000.

56:00.029 --> 56:03.152
That's $250,000.

56:04.453 --> 56:07.096
That means $260,000.

56:07.116 --> 56:09.298
That's $170,000.

56:09.358 --> 56:11.180
That's $180,000.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.882
That's $290,000.

56:12.902 --> 56:14.664
That's $300,000.

56:14.784 --> 56:17.406
On my left, that's $300,000.

56:17.426 --> 56:21.110
Now, they have $300,000.

56:21.130 --> 56:23.552
In any box, that's $300,000.

56:23.572 --> 56:28.197
In the left aisle, that's $300,000 there.

56:29.138 --> 56:41.318
And the thousand and thirty-one.

56:41.378 --> 56:44.143
The last 3349 is Cicero.

56:46.317 --> 56:51.946
I have $40,000 in the middle of this, $40,000 now.

56:51.966 --> 56:54.610
I have $40,000 in the middle of this, $40,000 now.

56:54.630 --> 57:10.654
I have $40,000 in the middle of this, $40,000 in the middle of this, $40,000 in the middle of this, $40,000 in the middle of this, $45,000 in the middle of this, $45,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the middle of this, $50,000 in the

57:10.634 --> 57:28.049
That's $75,000.

57:28.410 --> 57:32.558
That's $85,000.

57:32.538 --> 57:36.966
But $85,000 still has been rising.

57:36.986 --> 57:42.977
There's $85,000 in the center on the island at $85,000.

57:42.997 --> 57:47.164
They're pointing out $85,000.

57:47.185 --> 57:56.301
$85,000, and that's number 38.

58:01.732 --> 58:05.459
Life number 3350 is coming together.

58:06.882 --> 58:15.859
And $30,000, $30,000, $30,000, $30,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $45,000.

58:16.193 --> 58:19.218
$45,000.

58:19.238 --> 58:21.963
$45,000.

58:22.564 --> 58:25.750
$45,000.

58:26.351 --> 58:29.517
$50,000.

58:29.537 --> 58:32.422
$65,000.

58:32.442 --> 58:32.603
$60,000.

58:32.623 --> 58:33.705
$65,000.

58:33.725 --> 58:35.608
$70,000.

58:35.628 --> 58:36.490
$75,000.

58:36.510 --> 58:36.670
$75,000.

58:36.690 --> 58:37.632
$80,000 on the telephone.

58:37.652 --> 58:38.173
$85,000 up here.

58:38.193 --> 58:39.174
Then $85,000.

58:39.194 --> 58:39.355
$90,000.

58:39.375 --> 58:39.535
$90,000.

58:39.515 --> 58:44.421
$90,000, $95,000 from the back now, $95,000.

58:44.441 --> 58:48.666
$100,000 is up here now.

58:48.686 --> 58:53.792
At $100,000 now, up front at $100,000.

58:54.052 --> 58:56.114
At $105,000 on the silver.

58:56.395 --> 58:58.878
At $110,000 up front.

58:59.138 --> 59:02.802
At $110,000 now, $115,000 on the silver.

59:02.822 --> 59:03.463
At $120,000 up front.

59:03.443 --> 59:05.606
There are $120,125,000 now.

59:05.826 --> 59:07.848
And $130,000 up front.

59:08.309 --> 59:12.474
And $130,000, $135,000 up front.

59:12.494 --> 59:14.316
$140,000 up front.

59:14.457 --> 59:18.922
$140,000 into the room.

59:23.027 --> 59:30.236
That's $140,000 up front in the room.

59:30.256 --> 59:33.400
And $140,000 up front.

59:34.190 --> 59:49.093
What I am going to do now is ...

59:50.592 --> 59:58.482
351, Central, well, city 351, and I have $5,000 for only $5,000, $5,500.

59:58.502 --> 01:00:19.968
Now we get $5,500.

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:23.146
$13,000 on the yard, $14,000.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:28.572
At 14, $15,000 on my land, $16,000, $17,000.

01:00:29.352 --> 01:00:34.819
And $17,000 is $17,000, $18,000 now.

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:36.641
At 18, $19,000.

01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:39.003
At $19,000, say $20,000.

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:43.228
At $20,000, say $20,000.
