00:06.241 --> 00:11.813
Thank you.

00:37.375 --> 00:49.815
¶¶

00:52.192 --> 00:54.795
Thanks for joining us.

00:54.996 --> 00:56.297
I'm Diane Rain.

00:56.818 --> 01:04.547
My guest this hour, Nicholas Bazbaines, is author of a trilogy of books about books.

01:05.068 --> 01:12.798
He's gathered anecdotes about the history of books and libraries and met book collectors all over the world.

01:13.298 --> 01:15.381
The third volume, called

01:15.361 --> 01:25.998
A Splendor of Letters covers the role books play in preserving a culture and the role we play in preserving books.

01:26.459 --> 01:30.566
Throughout the hour, we'll welcome your calls, questions, comments.

01:31.067 --> 01:40.322
Join us on 1-800-433-8850 or send us your emails to drshow.com.

01:40.302 --> 01:42.606
at wamu.org.

01:43.748 --> 01:45.170
It's good to see you again.

01:45.271 --> 01:45.992
Thank you, Diane.

01:46.012 --> 01:46.813
Thank you for inviting me.

01:47.274 --> 02:01.539
The subtitle of your book, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World, implies that books may be very fragile in our world right now.

02:01.859 --> 02:05.145
I think books have always been fragile in our world and

02:05.429 --> 02:12.045
Two of the chapters that I develop in this book deal with what we call biblioclasm.

02:12.065 --> 02:17.278
The Oxford English Dictionary defines this as the calculated, deliberate

02:17.748 --> 02:18.849
destruction of books.

02:18.970 --> 02:32.768
I mean, I certainly am concerned with the loss of books through nature or through accident, but this is where cultures really target books and target libraries as a way of destroying a hated enemy.

02:33.329 --> 02:44.363
And you think that this would be something that would be rooted in the distant past, but I just point to 1992 on August 25th when in Sarajevo, where Serbian gunners

02:44.343 --> 02:52.092
targeted the National Library there, and in one night, a single night, 1.5 million books and manuscripts went up in flames.

02:52.112 --> 02:55.195
I mean, Hitler, in his best night, never did 1.5 million books.

02:55.816 --> 03:04.766
But, of course, that is the most vivid recollection so many of us have of the Nazi book.

03:04.827 --> 03:07.870
Exactly, the book, and didn't that galvanize the world?

03:07.850 --> 03:15.297
When you think that in 1933 Goebbels stood and they were talking about these enemies of the state, and who were some of these enemies?

03:15.437 --> 03:18.380
Helen Keller, I mean Albert Einstein.

03:18.400 --> 03:36.658
Helen Keller, who had written books and the royalties of which she had committed to the orphans of German children, had committed these funds to helping German people, and yet her books, because she was deemed perhaps to be a socialist or whatever, her books were destroyed in the auto de fe in Germany.

03:36.638 --> 03:44.332
What do you believe is the underlying motivation for destruction of books around the world?

03:44.873 --> 03:45.735
Is it fear?

03:46.035 --> 03:47.117
Is it knowledge?

03:47.157 --> 03:50.323
Is it the capacity to learn?

03:50.724 --> 03:54.371
Well, those are excellent questions, and I think you hit the nail on the head.

03:54.972 --> 03:57.837
I use a quote from Orwell, 1984.

03:58.120 --> 04:03.957
And when people read Orwell and they recall that novel, they think Big Brother is watching you is the most important quote.

04:03.977 --> 04:09.512
But the sentence that I have chosen, that I have selected to be so resonant here, is the one that goes like this.

04:10.315 --> 04:13.243
Who controls the present controls the past.

04:13.595 --> 04:16.338
Who controls the past controls the future.

04:16.899 --> 04:24.349
And when you think about the destruction in Sarajevo in 1992, this was all part of an unspeakable horror known as ethnic cleansing.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.191
It's not enough to kill the people.

04:26.251 --> 04:33.240
If you're really going to eliminate them, you have to destroy their cultural artifacts, their talisman, their libraries, ultimately their books.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.425
And that is why tyrants through history have been so emboldened to do this.

04:37.574 --> 04:56.899
But in a sense, the United States is not free of that destruction of books, however, without malice, simply by allowing books to degrade, disappear, move off.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.602
Exactly, and these are other issues.

04:59.983 --> 05:07.491
The biblioclasm element is one aspect, and as I said, it's two chapters in a book of ten chapters.

05:07.872 --> 05:18.585
I'm also concerned with decisions that libraries make not only to allow books to disintegrate, but to willfully select books for deaccession and for discarding.

05:18.645 --> 05:19.866
How did they do that?

05:19.846 --> 05:23.252
How does the library of Congress do that, for example?

05:23.272 --> 05:27.539
Well, you have to, you know, I think that it's impossible to keep everything.

05:28.059 --> 05:30.023
So some decisions have to be made.

05:30.103 --> 05:32.066
I mean, we have to weed, I suppose.

05:32.747 --> 05:35.211
Those of us, I'm sure you're in this.

05:35.592 --> 05:38.897
It's very difficult to live in a house with 10,000 books.

05:39.037 --> 05:39.718
Exactly.

05:39.738 --> 05:41.662
And, you know, they multiply at night sometimes.

05:41.682 --> 05:45.027
You wake up and they seem to be more than they were when you went to bed.

05:45.007 --> 05:50.454
But decisions have to be made, I suppose, on what books that you will discard.

05:50.694 --> 05:55.300
My fear is that every library is going to be getting rid of the same book.

05:55.340 --> 06:01.569
Every public library, every major library, does make decisions about books that are no longer applicable to their collections.

06:01.889 --> 06:08.758
There are libraries that have databases that show that books haven't been read in five years, and maybe that's justification.

06:08.778 --> 06:10.280
They've gone by their read-by date.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.922
Their read-by date has expired.

06:11.962 --> 06:13.444
I'm being facetious, of course.

06:13.829 --> 06:16.072
But books are then selected to be discarded.

06:16.552 --> 06:22.680
You know, one of my very favorite personal collections in my home, I collect any number of different kinds of books, but I call it my orphan collection.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.543
These are books that all have one thing in common.

06:25.563 --> 06:26.785
They are all ex libris.

06:27.445 --> 06:31.050
They all bear a stamp that says withdrawn or discarded.

06:31.550 --> 06:36.276
And I go around with my wife to flea markets and to yard sales and to library sales.

06:36.644 --> 06:37.827
And we find these books.

06:37.908 --> 06:49.741
I mean, my first edition copy of Dibdin's Bibliomania, well, actually, it's the second print in 1840, bears the former ownership stamp of the Concord Public Library in Concord, Massachusetts.

06:49.882 --> 06:50.704
I mean, it was there...

06:51.190 --> 06:54.818
in that library when Emerson was living in Concord, Massachusetts.

06:54.858 --> 06:58.567
You have to tell me how many books you have in your own library.

06:58.888 --> 07:01.534
Well, we estimate between 10 and 15,000.

07:01.694 --> 07:03.098
You say, boy, that's a big gap.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.002
How can you not know whether it's 10 or 15?

07:05.082 --> 07:08.490
In my second book, Patience and Fortitude,

07:08.572 --> 07:10.998
which I should point out is not a Jane Austen novel.

07:12.481 --> 07:22.465
Those are the names of the lions that stand guard in front of the New York Public Library, which I thought was a good image, lions standing guard at the gates of knowledge and of information for that book.

07:23.467 --> 07:25.973
But as I point out in that book,

07:25.953 --> 07:29.138
I'm afraid I lost the thread of the question there, Diana.

07:29.218 --> 07:32.584
Well, it was simply how many books you had in your own library.

07:32.604 --> 07:33.605
How many books do I have?

07:33.745 --> 07:38.413
How in the world you can keep, you must have some in storage.

07:38.653 --> 07:40.576
Exactly, and that's exactly where I was going.

07:40.616 --> 07:43.641
In Patience and Fortitude, I have a chapter called Deep Sleep.

07:43.621 --> 07:46.166
and that chapter is about off-site storage.

07:46.226 --> 07:48.570
Well, I have some off-site storage.

07:48.610 --> 07:57.586
I have a garage I rent in a little town I live in in central Massachusetts, and that garage is also filled with books, but about 15,000, I would say.

07:57.946 --> 08:01.132
And I'm talking with Nicholas Baz Baines.

08:01.633 --> 08:04.498
He is the author of a new book,

08:04.782 --> 08:06.064
part of a trilogy.

08:06.124 --> 08:13.513
It's called A Splendor of Letters, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World.

08:14.074 --> 08:15.816
I do invite you to join us.

08:15.856 --> 08:23.566
I'm sure you have your own thoughts about books, the permanence or impermanence thereof.

08:23.606 --> 08:31.296
And if you would like to join us, 1-800-433-8850 or

08:31.664 --> 08:37.291
send us your emails to drshow at wamu.org.

08:37.972 --> 08:45.863
In the preface of A Splendor of Letters, you tell the story of a message in a bottle.

08:46.764 --> 08:53.012
Talk about how that story illustrates what you're trying to get across in this book.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.194
It was happenstance.

08:54.274 --> 09:01.283
I was on vacation with my family on Cape Cod a couple years ago and read in the local newspaper, the Cape Cod Times,

09:01.938 --> 09:15.283
how a bottle bearing a message dropped over the side of a ship by an oceanographer from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in 1968 or 1969 had been found 30-some-odd years later.

09:15.323 --> 09:20.954
It had washed up on the beach in Nassau, and it had been found by another oceanographer.

09:21.615 --> 09:23.659
Now, when you think of here's a message,

09:24.230 --> 09:29.357
from one professional basically to another, and how it had made the passage across the vast ocean.

09:29.738 --> 09:37.028
Of course, what is a better image than a vast, bottomless ocean, and the fragile carrier of information being this little bottle?

09:37.228 --> 09:39.411
And the message was still readable?

09:39.451 --> 09:40.492
It was totally readable.

09:40.552 --> 09:42.475
It had been written on corrugated paper.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.618
It had been sealed in a green glass bottle.

09:44.598 --> 09:51.148
And the man who tossed it over the side of the ship, which makes it very interesting, it wasn't just, hello, how are you, my name is so-and-so.

09:51.588 --> 09:54.072
It was, here is where I am precisely at sea.

09:54.392 --> 09:55.634
These are my coordinates.

09:55.955 --> 09:59.300
This is the date that I'm putting this over the side.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.241
And he forgot about it.

10:00.522 --> 10:06.631
But then it was discovered by an oceanographer who was able to compute the currents that it might have followed.

10:06.651 --> 10:12.619
So it did send across an interesting message, however unlikely that might be.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.402
Do you know if the two people...

10:15.007 --> 10:16.231
finally spoke to each other.

10:16.251 --> 10:16.732
Oh, they did.

10:16.752 --> 10:17.595
They became friends.

10:18.116 --> 10:19.420
They corresponded.

10:19.460 --> 10:27.725
And what happened, he put his telephone number in there and he came home one night and there was a message on his answering machine and that the fellow's name was Sir Nicholas Nuttall.

10:27.765 --> 10:29.590
He lived in

10:29.941 --> 10:40.982
Bermuda, and he had a title as a peer, and he was also an oceanographer, and he said, I found the bottle, and the other guy who sent it had no clue as to what he'd forgotten about it.

10:41.002 --> 10:42.165
It had been so long.

10:42.185 --> 10:45.611
Does that make you want to put a bottle in the ocean?

10:45.631 --> 10:47.034
Well, not really.

10:47.715 --> 10:51.763
I guess what it does is it just energizes me into it.

10:51.743 --> 10:54.607
encourages me that all is not lost.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.911
The written word is important.

10:56.931 --> 11:00.656
The written word is not only important, but that it has a way of surviving.

11:01.157 --> 11:16.840
You know, I can only find one quintessential example of where the deliberate destruction of a culture, a final solution, has really worked, and that's the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC by the Romans, where the Roman Senate decreed Carthage must be destroyed,

11:17.208 --> 11:22.257
And not only did they go and kill the people and reduce the city to rubble, but they destroyed

11:22.642 --> 11:23.823
all of their books.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.346
And then the Carthaginians were a very literate people.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.407
They were brilliant people.

11:27.867 --> 11:40.320
And one of the chapters I have in this book I call Ex Libris Punicis, which means the Punic books, the Carthaginian books, which a Roman historian, Sallust, mentioned in a book in the first century B.C.

11:40.340 --> 11:44.684
and how a few of these had survived and had been translated for him and how important they were.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.826
And, of course, they are all gone.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.231
Survived in the sense that they were not on the kind of

11:51.211 --> 11:52.933
paper that we know now.

11:52.973 --> 11:53.213
No, no, no.

11:53.293 --> 12:04.424
What had happened is that when the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus was reducing Carthage to rubble, he took a few items from the library.

12:04.464 --> 12:12.733
It is assumed, and it has been suggested in a few sources, and that these books were given to some African princes who had supported the Roman cause.

12:12.773 --> 12:19.159
And so these few books had been later, a few, about 50 years later, been translated for the writer Sallust.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.292
That's a long story, but those two... But it's a wonderful story.

12:22.313 --> 12:24.040
It's a wonderful story.

12:24.140 --> 12:27.816
But I do want to get to this question of paper...

12:27.998 --> 12:44.809
versus linen or versus other materials on which the written word has been preserved and may not be preserved now because of the disintegration.

12:44.870 --> 12:49.939
Have you ever handled a 500-year-old book called an incunable up at the Library of Congress, say, or...

12:49.919 --> 12:54.244
The Folger Shakespeare Library, a first folio that has been published in 1623.

12:54.324 --> 13:02.314
These books are in remarkably fine condition because the original paper that they were printed on is pure paper.

13:02.334 --> 13:04.837
It has a number of different fibers in there.

13:04.857 --> 13:07.200
Paper is a remarkable, durable medium.

13:07.580 --> 13:14.188
When we talk about an incunable, which means it's a Latin phrase from the cradle, from the cradle of printing, which is 15th century.

13:14.675 --> 13:17.799
These books have survived for half a millennium, and they're beautiful.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.544
Go take a look at the Gutenberg Bible at the Library of Congress and see.

13:21.965 --> 13:25.590
They say it is still the example of where the first was the best.

13:26.050 --> 13:31.718
Think of any other technological achievement where the first is still the model by which all others are judged.

13:31.738 --> 13:34.321
And if you go take a look at the Gutenberg Bible, it's brilliant.

13:34.401 --> 13:34.942
It's beautiful.

13:35.002 --> 13:35.563
It's perfect.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.105
The paper has survived.

13:37.085 --> 13:46.760
It is only when we get into the 19th century when they start putting acids into the pulp, and then you start to have this acidic paper that yellows and crumbles.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.122
And disintegrates.

13:48.142 --> 13:49.283
And disintegrates.

13:49.404 --> 13:58.017
And that has been addressed, and I write about that in this book, the efforts that have been made to deacidify and to preserve many of these books.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.043
And the book is called A Splendor of Letters.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.488
Nicholas Bazbaines is the author.

14:05.468 --> 14:12.620
When we come back, we'll talk about books, libraries, what's happening to them.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.584
Take your calls, comments, questions.

14:16.266 --> 14:28.185
Stay with us.

15:29.303 --> 15:40.135
Nicholas Baspain said the title of this third book in your trilogy, A Splendor of Letters, has an interesting origin.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.257
It does.

15:42.378 --> 15:45.962
My wife and I, as I mentioned, we like to go out to book fairs.

15:46.222 --> 15:48.385
We like to go to yard sales, tag sales.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.328
We go to discard sales that libraries mount, where they...

15:51.308 --> 16:00.497
the books that you and I were talking about a little earlier that have been deselected and books that normally sell for 25 cents or 50 cents and these are my orphans.

16:01.038 --> 16:08.005
I liken it to going to the dog pound and giving some animal with an uncertain future a new lease on life.

16:08.045 --> 16:11.849
These are books that are one step away from the landfill or the pulping plant.

16:12.690 --> 16:20.438
Well, my wife and I one spring afternoon went to a sale of the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts and while I was fooling around with some

16:20.705 --> 16:22.326
catalogs, sale catalogs.

16:22.386 --> 16:25.429
I collect sale catalogs, Christie, Sotheby's, etc.

16:25.950 --> 16:30.574
On a folding table, my wife was rummaging through this cardboard box on the floor.

16:31.214 --> 16:36.079
And in this box was a bundle of magazines bound in twine.

16:36.279 --> 16:40.462
The Dial magazine, which was published and began publishing in 1839.

16:40.623 --> 16:43.085
It was founded by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

16:43.145 --> 16:45.027
The founding editor was Margaret Fuller.

16:45.707 --> 16:48.990
One of the principal contributors was Thoreau.

16:49.342 --> 17:01.728
These are books that are exceedingly scarce and very, very important in the American literary canon, and they were about, you know, two hours away from the pulping plant, and Connie, my wife, rescued these, and there's no other way to describe it.

17:01.748 --> 17:02.490
She rescued them.

17:02.993 --> 17:21.799
And in one of these magazines was an article by Emerson where he uses the phrase, and I have a lengthy, we won't read it because it's lengthy, but a lengthy excerpt from an Emerson article called Thoughts on Literature where he describes books as these splendors of letters.

17:21.919 --> 17:29.710
And Connie, I have to give her credit, she titled this book and she titled Patience and Fortitude and she pointed, she said, there's your title right there.

17:29.730 --> 17:32.173
Because not only was it a discard,

17:32.153 --> 17:38.801
Not only was it an important essay, but it struck with such pertinence to the whole point of what we were writing about in this book.

17:38.861 --> 17:41.564
And Emerson and I share the same birthday, May 25th.

17:42.125 --> 17:43.727
Truly, truly.

17:43.747 --> 17:45.188
He is 200 years old this year.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.910
He's looking at me in his rearview mirror.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.212
I'm catching up, I'm afraid.

17:49.053 --> 17:57.703
Well, you know, that brings to mind a thought, Nicholas Bazbaines, and that is, number one, do you have children?

17:58.103 --> 17:58.684
Two daughters.

17:58.985 --> 18:04.872
Are they as interested in books, magazines, publications as you?

18:05.052 --> 18:15.846
They grew up with books, and isn't it interesting, my older daughter went to Smith College, and our younger daughter will be graduating from Sweet Briar down here in Virginia, and they both worked in the library.

18:15.946 --> 18:17.468
This has been their choice.

18:17.728 --> 18:22.714
I ask that question because I wonder what happens.

18:22.694 --> 18:29.243
when you are no longer here to protect, conserve, defend.

18:29.303 --> 18:37.995
They've already told us precisely the things that they want, and I invite them to take anything that they want.

18:38.115 --> 18:46.086
These books are our books, and they derive as much joy out of the library as my wife and I do.

18:46.066 --> 18:51.415
They bring friends to the house because it is a library and say, what have we got on mathematics?

18:51.435 --> 18:52.557
What have we got on aviation?

18:52.597 --> 18:57.284
And I know I pride myself in knowing where everything is because it all is double-shelved.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.546
I mean, there are books behind books.

18:58.567 --> 18:59.047
I see.

18:59.448 --> 19:06.720
In most houses, young kids come to the house and say, where is such and such a video?

19:06.940 --> 19:10.346
Where is this DVD in your house?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.668
They come for books.

19:11.648 --> 19:16.495
Here is an email from Evie in Flagstaff, Arizona.

19:17.096 --> 19:21.182
I love the Victorian mystery author, Wilkie Collins.

19:21.903 --> 19:27.291
Once in the late 1990s, I checked out one of his books from the public library.

19:27.852 --> 19:32.199
I noticed that the book had not been checked out since 1965.

19:32.479 --> 19:35.023
I called...

19:35.206 --> 19:43.454
and asked the librarian if I could buy the book from them, since it was clearly not an active volume on their shelves.

19:44.274 --> 19:56.546
She said, no, I could not buy it outright, but I could lose it and pay the lost book fee, which I think was $35.

19:58.007 --> 20:03.492
This I did gladly and added the book to my collection of Cullen's work.

20:03.944 --> 20:06.650
I'm conflicted on that, I have to say.

20:06.951 --> 20:19.000
On the one hand, I guess I'm happy the book didn't go to a pulping plant, but on the other hand, as that letter started, I was so happy that the library said that they were going to keep it, even though nobody had checked it out.

20:19.721 --> 20:21.666
But then to encourage someone to

20:22.000 --> 20:26.204
steal the book, I guess, but pay for it so your conscience can be clear.

20:28.066 --> 20:29.547
I can't say that I approve of that.

20:29.988 --> 20:33.451
I begin Patience and Fortitude, by the way, by telling a little story.

20:33.731 --> 20:34.652
I'll make it very brief.

20:35.053 --> 20:36.474
I was desperate to find a book.

20:36.894 --> 20:38.035
I couldn't find it anywhere.

20:38.055 --> 20:42.220
It was an early edition of the catalog to Samuel Pepys' library.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.621
Harvard didn't have it.

20:43.641 --> 20:45.343
The Boston Public Library didn't have it.

20:45.923 --> 20:47.925
I finally found it in the Boston Athenaeum.

20:47.965 --> 20:49.487
It was an 85-year-old book.

20:49.527 --> 20:50.708
It had never been checked out.

20:50.868 --> 20:51.028
Oh.

20:51.481 --> 21:00.215
But there they had it, and as I was checking it out, I'm ebullient, and I say, oh, boy, 84 years, never been used.

21:00.315 --> 21:02.318
Who do you suppose they bought this book for?

21:03.079 --> 21:06.264
And the man looked up, and he said, we bought it for you, Mr. Bazbanks.

21:06.705 --> 21:07.926
Oh, how marvelous.

21:08.327 --> 21:13.455
It's been here 84 years waiting for you, and that's what a library's mission is.

21:13.857 --> 21:17.102
If nobody had used the book in 30 years, okay, fine.

21:17.302 --> 21:24.373
But our job, our mission, our responsibility is to keep it and to make it available for the readers who come, readers yet unborn, in my view.

21:24.873 --> 21:30.862
Let's talk for just a moment about libraries and what is happening to them.

21:31.483 --> 21:43.341
I mean, we've had a situation here in Montgomery County, a suburb of Washington, where the library was completely redone.

21:43.321 --> 21:52.233
and then did not have the money to reopen because the state funding, county funding, had been cut back.

21:52.813 --> 21:57.840
Now, you've got these kinds of situations occurring around the country.

21:58.320 --> 22:04.629
Libraries are closing because states don't have sufficient funds to maintain them.

22:04.649 --> 22:07.392
And unfortunately, libraries don't really have lobbyists for them.

22:07.412 --> 22:08.333
They don't have activists.

22:08.353 --> 22:12.619
They don't have people that will go forward and say, the most bang for your budget

22:12.818 --> 22:30.243
tax buck that you can get is in the public library, and it's the least, I mean, I don't know what percentage of our tax dollars goes to libraries, but I will bet in any major city that more people have library cards and participate and use the public library than any other municipal activity that I can think of.

22:30.383 --> 22:36.312
And yet, why is it that when the funds get tight, they really penalize the library?

22:36.612 --> 22:48.021
And I know that there's an organization here in the District of Columbia, Save DC Libraries, which is working to restore money and to put money back into the budget and has been quite successful, in fact, at doing that.

22:48.081 --> 22:52.292
But to me, it's a great transgression to really victimize the libraries.

22:52.492 --> 22:54.815
All right, let's open the phones.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.377
1-800-433-8850.

22:58.360 --> 23:07.433
If you'll just put those headphones on, you'll be able to participate with our callers.

23:07.934 --> 23:11.659
The first is from Ridgewood, New Jersey.

23:11.739 --> 23:12.720
Good morning, Deborah.

23:12.740 --> 23:13.882
Thanks for joining us.

23:14.283 --> 23:15.184
Good morning.

23:15.504 --> 23:19.630
I am touched by this conversation that I was...

23:20.048 --> 23:25.777
One of very secretive, obsessive compulsives about books.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.403
My comment, though, is when books get you into trouble.

23:30.766 --> 23:39.660
Some years ago, I was a member of a group of book readers, a book group, nice ladies, and we read nice books.

23:40.542 --> 23:46.832
And, of course, the discussion came up about the war, and I had read a book by the Cockburn Brothers,

23:47.268 --> 24:07.390
that had educated me about the first Gulf War, and that caused me to go into a whole trilogy of other books about the wars, I found that I began making statements that no one in the group was familiar with, and they considered me a supporter of, well, not very patriotic, and I got kicked out of my book group.

24:08.351 --> 24:16.380
And then that caused me to start reading books about pacifism and war resistance, and

24:16.816 --> 24:32.419
I came up with a book that was discarded from a library in California called Poems of War Resistance from 2000 BC to, I guess, the Vietnam War.

24:32.759 --> 24:35.143
And I found that I wasn't alone.

24:36.164 --> 24:45.658
So from 2000 BC to the present, there have been people writing about this phenomenon and how isolated you tend to feel when

24:46.094 --> 24:51.585
You know a little bit more about war and how futile it tends to be.

24:51.786 --> 24:53.978
You know, Deborah, what I love about this story is that...

24:54.430 --> 24:56.092
this book was a discard.

24:56.853 --> 25:04.844
You wouldn't have discovered this, everything that you just spoke about, had you not come across one of these orphan books that I was just talking about.

25:04.864 --> 25:05.364
It was a discard.

25:05.384 --> 25:15.718
It was a book that people at a library in California apparently had deemed irrelevant and that nobody would be interested in, and yet here's this woman in New Jersey, and it's moved her and changed her life.

25:15.938 --> 25:16.419
Indeed.

25:16.659 --> 25:18.482
Thanks for calling, Debra.

25:18.502 --> 25:23.408
Here's an email from Kellyanne, Oklahoma City,

25:23.658 --> 25:33.554
I am concerned that with the rise of audiobooks and e-books, there will be less availability eventually to everyone.

25:34.055 --> 25:47.556
No special equipment is required to read a printed page, but for those who do not have the appropriate electronic device, audiobooks or e-books are unavailable.

25:47.705 --> 25:56.865
Many of us have found our music collections to be inaccessible with the arrival of newer forms of audio equipment.

25:57.265 --> 26:05.603
Two points there, and that is, are those audiobooks beginning to overtake?

26:05.884 --> 26:06.405
Not at all.

26:06.790 --> 26:10.515
In a word, what's that expression, don't give up the day job just yet?

26:10.695 --> 26:11.055
Yeah.

26:11.075 --> 26:14.179
I mean, how many different titles were produced in the United States last year?

26:14.199 --> 26:16.041
60,000, give or take.

26:17.123 --> 26:19.065
I throw this out as a challenge.

26:19.085 --> 26:24.972
How many people out there have read a book from page one to the final page completely on a computer screen?

26:24.992 --> 26:26.574
I've yet to meet a person who's done it.

26:27.735 --> 26:31.560
The fact of the matter is reading a book is a tactile experience.

26:31.660 --> 26:32.581
We handle the book.

26:33.262 --> 26:35.565
And when people want something online, what do they do?

26:35.832 --> 26:41.359
when they want to read it at any depth and any length, they download it and they print it.

26:41.399 --> 26:42.060
They print it out.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.722
They still want that artifact.

26:44.763 --> 26:48.648
My view is that the printed book has a long way to go before we write its obituary.

26:48.869 --> 26:52.774
And here's Mike in Beltsville looking back.

26:53.274 --> 27:03.207
Was there a time when people saw that the codex type of book would overtake the scroll in availability?

27:03.187 --> 27:08.575
Did this transition cause a crisis among those who could read?

27:08.595 --> 27:13.662
That's a great question, and I write about it in this book, in fact, at some length.

27:14.283 --> 27:17.148
There have always been people who are resistant to change.

27:17.608 --> 27:19.811
There was an abbot by the name of Trithemius.

27:20.232 --> 27:21.494
I write about Trithemius.

27:21.534 --> 27:22.696
He was writing in 1493.

27:23.156 --> 27:29.025
He was a very famous man of his time, and he wrote this book in praise of scribes.

27:29.005 --> 27:39.100
I quote it at length in here, and what he said, scribes of the world, don't give up your quills, the printing press can't last, you know, he goes on in that vein.

27:39.367 --> 27:50.458
And what I find really kind of cutely ironic about that is he made this between the hardcovers of a printed book, and nothing in his handwriting pertaining to this particular essay survives.

27:50.859 --> 27:54.763
You know, there's always been a technological opposition.

27:54.803 --> 28:03.552
When the photograph was invented and introduced in 1839, everyone thought, I mean painters, not everyone, but artists, painters thought, this is the end, we're done.

28:03.532 --> 28:06.557
How can we possibly compete with this medium?

28:06.918 --> 28:20.382
But as Dr. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, said to me, and I quote him in this book, he said, what the photograph did to painting is allow them to explore new areas of artistic expression.

28:20.402 --> 28:22.806
To expand rather than contract.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.050
And what I think that the electronic...

28:25.030 --> 28:32.157
medium will allow the printed book to do will be to really achieve its full potential as a creative medium.

28:32.437 --> 28:38.443
We're not going to need telephone books anymore, but we are going to use these objects, these artifacts for creativity.

28:38.884 --> 28:43.949
At 25 before the hour, you're listening to the Diane Rehm Show.

28:45.530 --> 28:49.694
And on that very question, let's go to Phoenix, Arizona.

28:50.135 --> 28:51.796
Leanne, good morning to you.

28:52.457 --> 28:52.898
Hi, Diane.

28:52.918 --> 28:53.398
How are you doing?

28:53.418 --> 28:54.379
Fine, thanks.

28:54.612 --> 28:55.013
Good.

28:55.233 --> 28:59.178
I find that this is a very interesting conversation.

28:59.198 --> 29:04.946
My mother is an English major, and my sister inherited her love of books.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.109
I, however, not really.

29:07.129 --> 29:09.151
I'm trying to get back into it.

29:09.192 --> 29:13.457
I'm a television producer, so I love the media.

29:14.679 --> 29:20.046
I love movies and television and stuff, and I personally am not crazy about books.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.369
I'm getting there.

29:22.389 --> 29:37.102
So I guess my question would be, you know, with the emergence of the technology, I heard you say that no one is about to, you know, read an entire book online, but don't you think that that could save some of these old books and some of these old stories?

29:37.242 --> 29:48.852
I mean, you know, some of the older books and stuff, when they're made into movies, that just rekindles, you know, the excitement about these old ideas and these old stories.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.033
And I would think that this

29:50.418 --> 29:56.627
this technology and stuff could actually inspire a whole generation of new people to get back into reading.

29:57.168 --> 30:03.478
Well, it might bring people to reading, but I don't see how the medium is going to work to preserve when you think you're a producer.

30:04.540 --> 30:06.002
What's the lifespan of a CD?

30:06.162 --> 30:06.943
I mean, 10 years?

30:08.225 --> 30:16.037
What good is a perfectly preserved document, say, on Microsoft Word 500 years from now if there's no software to read it on?

30:16.017 --> 30:20.364
What good is Stonehenge as a computer if nobody can interpret what these symbols mean?

30:20.725 --> 30:24.711
That's the big problem, ensuring the longevity of these digital documents.

30:24.731 --> 30:25.653
People have written about this.

30:25.733 --> 30:29.999
Jeff Nunberg is one of the principal engineers who's working on this.

30:30.681 --> 30:34.707
Fine, we can create digital documents, but how do we preserve them for the long run?

30:34.747 --> 30:39.855
Because the hardware and the software is changing all the time, and it is so vulnerable to decay.

30:40.216 --> 30:41.518
I'm not so sure that it is vulnerable.

30:41.819 --> 30:44.383
that it is the way to ensure long-term preservation.

30:44.724 --> 30:48.009
I think there is a question on that very issue.

30:48.129 --> 30:50.673
Jim in Cantonville, Ohio.

30:50.774 --> 30:51.415
Good morning.

30:51.915 --> 30:52.917
Well, good morning to you both.

30:54.640 --> 31:01.431
Mr. Besbaines, I've just been summing patience and fortitude again as I've been waiting to get on the line.

31:01.765 --> 31:05.130
I wanted to thank you for giving me a term for my lifestyle in that book.

31:05.150 --> 31:08.976
I always wondered what I was, and I found out that I was an ideo-rhythmic monk.

31:10.599 --> 31:11.580
Say that again.

31:11.640 --> 31:12.161
That's great.

31:12.201 --> 31:12.762
Good for you.

31:13.043 --> 31:14.525
Ideo-rhythmic monasticism.

31:14.625 --> 31:18.551
I don't know if you want to... You can speak to that if you want, or we can let it pass.

31:18.571 --> 31:29.308
I think we'll just suggest people go to Chapter 2 of that book and to follow my trip to Mount Athos in Greece, where there was this monastic tradition that really preserved a culture

31:29.710 --> 31:32.853
by preserving the documents and preserving the books.

31:32.873 --> 31:42.164
But there are two kinds of monasticism, and the idio-rhythmic kind are the people who follow their own... What's the translation there, Jim?

31:42.484 --> 31:46.589
Following your own life's harmonies or something like that?

31:46.789 --> 31:47.610
Yeah.

31:48.010 --> 31:52.475
Anyway, yeah, regarding a book collection, and then I want to talk about my own publishing experience briefly.

31:53.296 --> 31:57.180
My rule was once I got to 1,000 books, it was one in, one out.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.683
So whenever I found a book I didn't think I could live without

31:59.883 --> 32:01.767
I had to cull one from my collection.

32:01.867 --> 32:03.751
Umberto Eco makes it $30,000.

32:04.313 --> 32:08.221
Everything over $30,000 is, if one comes in, one has to go.

32:08.261 --> 32:08.802
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

32:08.822 --> 32:12.069
Okay, but anyway, that was my rubric.

32:12.510 --> 32:18.523
With my own experience, I had some background in writing for newspapers and magazines and journals and so forth.

32:18.563 --> 32:19.866
Well, I did a memoir.

32:20.234 --> 32:31.466
And I decided, I did contact some people and had some interest, but the time lag and the time frame for getting a book out, I wrote it primarily for my son and for some colleagues.

32:32.187 --> 32:40.396
And so I decided, because of having complete control over all the elements of the book, that I went with on-demand electronic publishing.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.660
And I wanted to address that as perhaps a middle way.

32:43.893 --> 32:58.514
where obviously, you know, the tax laws, this may be a little bit of inside baseball, but when the tax laws change so that booksellers could no longer keep their backlist inventories without them being taxed, that's when we started to lose things.

32:58.534 --> 33:04.183
All right, Jim, we'll talk about that after we take just a short break.

33:04.603 --> 33:09.490
If you want to stay on the line, I think Nicholas can respond.

33:10.011 --> 33:11.233
Stay with us.
