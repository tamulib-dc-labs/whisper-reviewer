00:02.360 --> 00:10.810
Any writing that comes out of the same society is going to have something in common.

00:11.431 --> 00:12.412
Let me put it this way.

00:12.432 --> 00:22.203
The first time I read Faulkner, never having been to the South and knowing nothing about it as an adolescent in Canada, I thought that Faulkner had the most wonderful imagination.

00:23.164 --> 00:30.713
I thought of the Oxford, Mississippi or the county that he created as kind of land of Oz where all these

00:31.672 --> 00:35.576
People did these wonderful, unreal things.

00:36.517 --> 00:38.379
You're talking about my favorite author.

00:38.519 --> 00:38.819
I know.

00:38.879 --> 00:39.780
No, I thought he was wonderful.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.821
But I didn't.

00:41.322 --> 00:45.846
Then I met somebody from Oxford, Mississippi who said, honey, he didn't make anything up.

00:45.866 --> 00:46.627
He just wrote it all down.

00:47.368 --> 00:54.956
And that's what somebody from the South would understand, whereas I had to work at understanding that.

00:55.917 --> 01:00.261
When you write about Canadians, did you say the same thing about myself?

01:00.477 --> 01:02.018
You're not making anything up.

01:02.038 --> 01:02.839
You're just writing it down.

01:02.859 --> 01:04.281
Well, I am making things up.

01:04.301 --> 01:06.283
Giving it your own little twist, of course.

01:06.343 --> 01:09.986
I'm not making things up about the nature of the society, nor is he.

01:11.287 --> 01:14.530
There's a wonderful book by John Kenneth Galbraith called The Scots.

01:15.892 --> 01:21.817
And if you read that in connection with... It's not a book of economics.

01:21.837 --> 01:29.725
It's a book about his childhood in a small town, much like Deptford, much like Robertson Davies' small town life.

01:30.616 --> 01:41.149
And if you put that together with Roberts and Davies, and then with somebody like Alice Monroe, you'll see that there is a commonality.

01:46.817 --> 01:59.813
It was funny in New York, because the New Yorkers, the Alabama people, it all made perfect sense for them because they knew small towns, but the New York people said,

02:00.282 --> 02:07.994
Are there more crazy people and idiots in Canada than there are anywhere else?

02:08.014 --> 02:09.376
And I said, look out the window.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.963
I said, the difference is that in a big city, you don't know them personally.

02:15.045 --> 02:17.549
Whereas in a small town, everybody knows everybody.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.373
So that the idiot might be related to you.

02:21.355 --> 02:23.818
Or the crazy person is your... Probably.

02:23.838 --> 02:24.680
In fact, probably.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.942
It's not maybe, probably.

02:26.062 --> 02:26.863
Yes.

02:27.535 --> 02:32.823
Anyway, you know not only their life history, but the life history of everybody else related to them.

02:32.843 --> 02:36.068
And it's much closer and more personal.

02:37.189 --> 02:42.477
Are you an angry woman, as John Irving has suggested?

02:42.497 --> 02:43.779
Is that what you suggested?

02:43.799 --> 02:47.625
Yeah, I read that in the Maclean's piece.

02:47.645 --> 02:53.153
They quoted Irving as saying that you're an angry woman.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.378
I suppose it depends what you mean by that.

02:57.151 --> 03:03.683
I would have to save the context in which you said that because I know him and I've never given him any cause to believe that I'm angry with him.

03:05.046 --> 03:06.589
I don't think that would be context.

03:06.609 --> 03:07.631
No, I don't think so.

03:08.151 --> 03:10.616
I think people ought to be angry about certain things.

03:11.718 --> 03:16.848
And if they're not angry about those things, then there's something wrong with them.

03:16.868 --> 03:17.449
How about that?

03:17.870 --> 03:18.130
That's great.

03:18.970 --> 03:25.158
But that doesn't mean that I'm personally angry about my own life, which would be very... I do not believe that.

03:25.258 --> 03:27.120
That was the suggestion.

03:27.140 --> 03:31.285
I think about things in a metaphysical sense, perhaps.

03:31.406 --> 03:32.227
Bad behavior.

03:32.527 --> 03:32.887
Yeah.

03:33.408 --> 03:34.910
I'm angry about bad behavior.

03:37.253 --> 03:44.923
Are you apprehensive at all about the response you might get from some feminist critics to this?

03:44.983 --> 03:46.885
Feminists have all been little girls.

03:49.480 --> 03:56.808
when either they have led completely isolated and charmed childhoods of little girls, or they will know where else I'd speak.

03:59.190 --> 04:13.786
And also, nobody can have gone through the women's movement for the past 15 or 20 years without having seen grown-up examples of women forming alliances against other women.

04:14.928 --> 04:18.171
But I think you're also saying something here that

04:19.771 --> 04:28.861
I don't need to read this into it, but it's not a case of women always being morally correct.

04:30.202 --> 04:39.713
It's not like women have a copyright on being... Women do not have a copyright on being morally correct, but nobody but the most complete idealist would always believe that they did.

04:40.754 --> 04:41.195
Exactly.

04:42.236 --> 04:46.460
I subscribe wholeheartedly to the fact that you have the courage to dramatize this in this novel.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.383
Men are morally incorrect in more drastic ways.

04:48.483 --> 04:49.744
I mean, men make wars.

04:50.011 --> 04:53.396
through a lot more rape and murder than women do.

04:54.697 --> 05:01.587
So they do have that sort of aggressive, violent aspect to them which cannot be denied either.

05:02.228 --> 05:18.330
However, that does not mean that women are pure and thoughtward indeed, or are without the urge to power, which can be energizing and productive and steered in the right direction and can be destructive as much.

05:19.441 --> 05:32.883
So let us just say that women are human beings, that their methods and areas of operation may be different, but that they are not without the ability to be destructive.

05:32.903 --> 05:38.473
Would you call this a kind of a coming-of-age novel in a way?

05:42.419 --> 05:43.861
You could call it many things.

05:44.002 --> 05:46.005
You could call it a building for a mom.

05:46.812 --> 05:50.095
That was the word I didn't want to use.

05:50.115 --> 05:55.441
Well, since I studied the buildings in Vermont here in this very area, why not use it?

05:55.561 --> 06:00.105
You could call it a portrait of the artist as a young woman.

06:00.706 --> 06:02.347
There are many... Quite literally, actually.

06:02.408 --> 06:05.150
Yes, there are many analogies that you could use.

06:05.951 --> 06:08.734
You could call it... I don't know.

06:09.014 --> 06:10.936
I mean, I leave it out to other people to call it.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.437
That's my job again.

06:12.458 --> 06:14.980
Yeah, I would call it.

06:15.432 --> 06:19.337
It was kind of, I never read dust jacket verbs.

06:19.717 --> 06:21.880
I still haven't.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.144
They outrage me, as a matter of fact.

06:25.925 --> 06:26.506
They really do.

06:26.546 --> 06:34.696
I mean, so many of them give away the plot and tell me things about people dying who die on page 150 or something.

06:34.776 --> 06:36.458
And I want to get that in its own.

06:37.699 --> 06:40.843
And it's really a great way to read a book.

06:40.863 --> 06:43.026
I'm sorry to go off like this.

06:43.495 --> 06:47.959
pick up the book and just take it.

06:47.979 --> 06:58.830
So I really stayed away from the reviews, and I still haven't read the Times review, but I will when I come to write or after I've written things.

06:58.850 --> 07:06.317
But in any case, things surprised me, and particularly this view you give us of these young girls.

07:06.558 --> 07:08.820
That really, I didn't expect that.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.081
Did you have sisters?

07:10.101 --> 07:11.022
I had two daughters.

07:11.491 --> 07:12.433
How old are they now?

07:12.473 --> 07:13.935
They are seven and six.

07:14.376 --> 07:14.977
You haven't hit it yet.

07:14.997 --> 07:16.419
And they're just angels.

07:16.439 --> 07:18.302
You haven't hit it yet.

07:18.322 --> 07:18.542
Wait.

07:20.946 --> 07:21.547
Wait for it.

07:21.908 --> 07:22.148
Yeah.

07:22.589 --> 07:25.854
And I've said, God, girls are the best.

07:25.935 --> 07:28.679
I wanted sons.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.682
Oh, they are wonderful.

07:30.782 --> 07:31.644
Just wonderful.

07:31.664 --> 07:32.525
They are wonderful.

07:32.565 --> 07:34.208
Really, really beautiful.

07:35.403 --> 07:39.787
But there is that period, that dangerous period, between... Which is ahead, right?

07:39.807 --> 07:50.816
...about eight and eleven, when you will probably find that there are intense relationships with other little girls, and those relationships sometimes become problematical.

07:50.836 --> 08:04.228
Now, I think parents are much more on to things nowadays, because the world of adults and the world of children are less hermetically sealed off from one another than they used to be.

08:04.647 --> 08:08.232
more is known on either side.

08:08.252 --> 08:18.826
And there isn't that attitude which really was quite prevalent, that it's good for the child to fight their own battles, even if it ends up with them getting mutilated along the way.

08:21.249 --> 08:29.760
The voice—how do you ask the question about projecting voice?

08:29.900 --> 08:33.405
It's a gift, I think.

08:34.094 --> 08:35.275
I wonder when it comes.

08:35.375 --> 08:39.540
I'm asking a question, I guess, about the creative process.

08:39.961 --> 08:41.202
How do you get the voice?

08:41.222 --> 08:43.265
Where does it really hear it?

08:43.325 --> 08:50.533
At what point does it begin to express itself and presumably take on a life of its own?

08:50.553 --> 08:52.695
You mean in the writing of any individual book?

08:52.716 --> 08:54.678
Yeah, there's nothing in it.

08:54.998 --> 08:57.000
Well, we hope by about page 10.

08:57.241 --> 08:57.541
Really?

08:58.302 --> 09:01.806
And if you don't get it, then you have to start over again.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.745
That's a wonderful answer.

09:05.765 --> 09:06.426
Do you hear it?

09:06.486 --> 09:16.221
Yeah, sometimes you hear it right away, and sometimes you have to work your way into it and discard a member because they're in it wrong.

09:17.022 --> 09:20.567
I started with a couple of other voices, but it's character, and they're just wrong.

09:21.689 --> 09:26.777
So they could not be used.

09:26.797 --> 09:29.561
I haven't read the whole show of Margaret Atwood.

09:30.362 --> 09:30.983
I hope to.

09:33.308 --> 09:35.932
I loved Handmaid's Tale.

09:36.152 --> 09:39.397
This is the best novel that I've read of yours, may I say.

09:41.099 --> 09:42.441
Well, I think you're right.

09:42.461 --> 09:47.208
For whatever that small opinion is worth.

09:47.288 --> 09:50.673
You never lose your sense of humor, which is important.

09:51.975 --> 09:56.742
Well, it's very important in life, don't you think?

09:56.762 --> 09:57.102
Indeed.

09:59.586 --> 10:01.729
You can go on if you'd like on that.

10:01.979 --> 10:03.861
You could say more on that if you'd like.

10:04.843 --> 10:07.847
Well, I think there's a higher suicide risk among people without it.

10:11.431 --> 10:15.516
I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

10:15.536 --> 10:20.102
I really want to meet you.

10:20.122 --> 10:22.766
Again, the book speaks for itself.

10:23.106 --> 10:24.328
Here's a question.

10:24.348 --> 10:27.151
Do you write for a particular audience?

10:27.993 --> 10:29.134
No, I write for the reader.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.781
The reader can be anybody.

10:35.323 --> 10:39.670
The reader is like Plastic Man in the comics.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.233
He could disguise himself as anything.

10:42.794 --> 10:44.176
Do you remember that?

10:44.336 --> 10:46.640
Did you read comics?

10:46.660 --> 10:47.020
Indeed, yeah.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.983
Plastic Man was one of my favorites.

10:49.003 --> 10:53.830
Well, he could be a lamp or he could be a flashlight or contact.

10:53.851 --> 10:54.912
He could be a chandelier.

10:55.493 --> 10:58.277
You always knew because he was red and blue.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.148
So the reader has that characteristic, namely the reader is literate.

11:05.009 --> 11:06.792
The reader is up to things.

11:06.972 --> 11:13.603
The reader is willing to go into the story and be there.

11:15.486 --> 11:17.930
Those are the red and blue of the reader.

11:18.450 --> 11:21.535
But apart from that, the reader can be anybody.

11:22.797 --> 11:26.543
You never know when you may meet the reader.

11:27.333 --> 11:33.322
You're not writing for Canadians, Americans, women, men?

11:33.502 --> 11:36.446
All of those are quite free to read my book.

11:36.506 --> 11:40.252
And you're translated in 20 languages, I guess.

11:40.292 --> 11:45.399
This book has been amazingly well in England.

11:45.419 --> 11:48.584
Why would that surprise you?

11:48.604 --> 11:54.032
Well, because Canadians up until very recently in England were thought of as the most boring.

11:55.295 --> 11:57.498
of all these ex-colonial countries.

11:57.918 --> 11:58.279
Really?

11:58.299 --> 11:59.660
The Canadians are on the bottom.

12:00.842 --> 12:01.983
Below Australia?

12:02.003 --> 12:02.804
Way below.

12:03.124 --> 12:04.646
Australians had kangaroos.

12:05.868 --> 12:10.433
I'm sorry to lie, you've never heard that.

12:10.453 --> 12:13.437
Well, it's true.

12:13.457 --> 12:20.205
It used to be that if you were a Canadian and you were in England, people would find out you were a Canadian and they'd say, oh, how interesting.

12:20.995 --> 12:23.418
and they talk to the person on the other side.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.440
So traditionally they don't read Canadian authors?

12:25.460 --> 12:32.068
Well, they do now, because myself and Robertson Davies and others are now hitting the stands.

12:32.188 --> 12:34.511
In fact, Canada has become a bit of a hot item.

12:35.292 --> 12:36.974
This is all very recent.

12:36.994 --> 12:40.137
There's a new young fellow, Neil... Neil Batumda.

12:40.338 --> 12:42.200
I'm supposed to talk to him in about a week or so.

12:42.220 --> 12:42.880
It's very nice.

12:42.941 --> 12:44.202
I've had a chance to look at the book.

12:44.302 --> 12:45.343
Yeah, I feel like it.

12:45.504 --> 12:48.607
I'm told it's interesting.

12:48.627 --> 12:49.348
There are two books.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.383
One is a book of short stories.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.204
This is a novel.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.508
This novel has come out.

12:54.529 --> 12:55.250
It's from Crown.

12:56.031 --> 13:01.341
We're just setting the thing up today, so I can really keep up with the next interview.

13:01.401 --> 13:05.027
He did well in England, but he's originally from the West Indies.

13:05.187 --> 13:07.552
He claims to be related to Nipah.

13:08.012 --> 13:09.976
He is.

13:10.597 --> 13:12.841
He's one of my favorite stories.

13:12.861 --> 13:14.644
In fact, I'm going to New York next week, too.

13:16.615 --> 13:21.421
Well, and did you talk with Michael Ondaatje at all?

13:21.501 --> 13:21.621
No.

13:21.661 --> 13:23.524
Well, that would be interesting as well.

13:23.564 --> 13:26.708
That really worked, wouldn't it?

13:26.728 --> 13:26.828
Yeah.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.370
But you see, we all know one.

13:28.450 --> 13:29.451
It's a small country.

13:30.012 --> 13:32.455
I've known Michael 13 was 18.

13:32.475 --> 13:41.787
I'm a little bit older than he is, so I was 20-something.

13:41.807 --> 13:42.468
19.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.129
It was 19.

13:46.417 --> 14:11.479
When I asked you that question about the audience, I liked being able to... Well, if the unknown member is reader, and I will read just about anything, or I will pick it up and give it a try, and it doesn't matter whether it's by a man, a woman, or what country, I will still read it.

14:11.797 --> 14:13.359
Do you favor fiction, really?

14:14.101 --> 14:17.165
Yeah, I favor fiction and pop science.

14:17.185 --> 14:17.386
Really?

14:17.566 --> 14:19.729
I can't touch science with that.

14:19.769 --> 14:20.570
No, pop science is my right.

14:20.711 --> 14:24.076
By pop science, I mean science without numbers, without the numbers in it.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.818
I don't want to have to do the mathematics.

14:25.838 --> 14:28.322
I just want to have them tell me what they've figured out.

14:28.342 --> 14:30.926
Now, you read the Hawking book came out last year.

14:31.327 --> 14:36.715
Oh, the Hawking book was just... So you must have grabbed that quote while you were almost finished.

14:36.735 --> 14:38.057
Yeah, I grabbed that quote.

14:38.392 --> 14:49.264
Because I was looking through about seven other books for a quote about time, and I had about three or four other quotes that I could have used, because they all talk about time.

14:49.984 --> 15:01.256
Hawking's book is like a number of other books, except that it's very well written, and he's a very unusual figure, but it is a man who is presenting physics to a non-physics audience.

15:01.557 --> 15:06.542
How can anyone explain that that book has been a bestseller for almost a year?

15:07.062 --> 15:12.188
Well, Carl Sagan did very well as well.

15:12.408 --> 15:14.651
Carl Sagan's books do well as well.

15:14.671 --> 15:17.034
His book was more popular.

15:17.635 --> 15:20.578
I think it's the nature of the man.

15:20.618 --> 15:25.384
Someone operating under extreme disability.

15:26.646 --> 15:29.910
And to be so brilliant.

15:29.930 --> 15:36.057
To be able to figure out ways of overcoming this and getting the message out despite

15:36.593 --> 15:38.556
What a message.

15:38.656 --> 15:49.532
I think it appeals very much to the part of everybody that feels that they've got something pulling against them.

15:49.552 --> 15:51.735
You know, that thing that you have to overcome.

15:51.755 --> 15:54.399
Do you think that's what draws people to the book?

15:54.419 --> 15:55.681
It's certainly one of the things.

15:56.242 --> 16:01.109
I mean, the subject for me is... The subject is wonderful as well.

16:01.209 --> 16:02.451
Well, it's intimidating.

16:02.471 --> 16:05.335
But there have been a number of other books on the subject.

16:05.585 --> 16:10.151
Now, this is by one of the primary thinkers in the field.

16:10.231 --> 16:13.415
And he writes beautifully, I have to say, as a writer.

16:14.696 --> 16:16.038
But his prose is wonderful.

16:16.919 --> 16:21.745
So it's worth reading just for the prose as well.

16:21.765 --> 16:24.989
It's not one of those science books that get you all completely bogged.

16:28.053 --> 16:32.959
And that same McLean's piece, which I do learn through.

16:33.513 --> 16:50.312
The person who wrote it mentioned that you see yourself as being something of a journalist in terms of, not for writing journalism, but for the powers of observation.

16:50.332 --> 16:52.074
Well, I like to get the clothing right.

16:53.216 --> 16:59.503
The clothing, the dates of the appearances of the awkward pink refrigerator.

17:00.327 --> 17:06.073
And I think you need to do that, because if you get them wrong, you lose the reader.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.655
And the reader will pick you up on that.

17:08.675 --> 17:08.956
Oh, yeah.

17:08.976 --> 17:09.476
Oh, yeah.

17:09.696 --> 17:14.221
I'm a stickler for that stuff, for any little detail.

17:14.261 --> 17:30.317
I mean, Stephen Brenningham did a piece, a book on, this wasn't fiction, but he mentioned how John Sears, one of the last great lost popes, politicians from Massachusetts,

17:30.989 --> 17:33.513
ran for mayor against Michael Tupacus.

17:33.913 --> 17:38.721
Well, I mean, Michael Tupacus would get killed if he ever ran for mayor of Boston.

17:38.801 --> 17:39.742
I mean, I'm Greek.

17:39.782 --> 17:42.026
They were not like a Greek mayor.

17:42.546 --> 17:44.529
The only thing Mike ever ran for was governor.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.714
I mean, that's a major, major error.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.876
How could he be wrong or something like that?

17:48.896 --> 17:50.679
And I asked him, and I thought it was just a mistake.

17:50.699 --> 17:51.360
He said, really?

17:52.682 --> 17:55.486
And you know, I didn't write the piece.

17:55.586 --> 17:59.051
I have to say my, I said, gee, gee, gee, they didn't check this thing out.

17:59.832 --> 18:00.253
That's a

18:00.436 --> 18:07.085
A small era, but it nevertheless for me is the kind of thing... Well, I changed some things on purpose.

18:07.105 --> 18:09.408
Yeah, but that's... But you're writing fiction, too.

18:09.428 --> 18:10.189
You have the right.

18:10.209 --> 18:16.658
...visits Canada in my book two years earlier than she actually did, but nobody would ever know that unless I told her.

18:17.659 --> 18:19.421
And I would never catch that.

18:19.441 --> 18:25.029
The plays that Cordelia appears in at Stratford were never produced in the same music.

18:25.049 --> 18:29.835
Well, that's... Tyrone Guthrie wasn't even the director when I said he was, but...

18:30.271 --> 18:36.779
Only extreme nitpickers would ever figure that out.

18:36.960 --> 18:42.727
I can't see, you know, bringing you to task for that, particularly writing a novel.

18:43.528 --> 18:44.009
That's right.

18:44.029 --> 18:46.232
And you have this license to do things.

18:46.252 --> 18:51.559
I think the stocks and snowsuit details are more important.

18:51.659 --> 18:58.708
If you take a Cadillac and put tail fins on it three years before they had tail fins, that's a mistake.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.361
Because that's a cultural thing.

19:00.401 --> 19:08.250
They're trying to pick up cultural... Well, one guy asked me why I had these marbles in his blue crown royal bag.

19:09.391 --> 19:12.314
Now, it could quite easily be described as purple.

19:14.356 --> 19:15.257
Purple and blue.

19:15.277 --> 19:17.540
Yeah, it is.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.641
So much the color of that.

19:18.801 --> 19:24.827
Yeah, except it's a little bluer if you actually look at it.

19:24.848 --> 19:27.210
I said that I needed blue.

19:28.253 --> 19:31.498
I would rather describe it as blue for the scene.

19:32.599 --> 19:38.789
Blue is a much more appropriate color because everything associated with that bridge is blue.

19:39.389 --> 19:42.094
Do you labor over little details like this?

19:42.114 --> 19:44.076
I don't know whether it's called laboring.

19:44.096 --> 19:47.241
I think it's called... Pressing?

19:48.243 --> 19:51.347
No, I think it's called making appropriate choices.

19:53.210 --> 19:55.273
But does it interrupt the flow of the writing?

19:57.633 --> 19:58.554
No, not particularly.

19:58.634 --> 20:00.296
Is it the kind of thing you go back and work on?

20:00.596 --> 20:05.300
I do a lot of revision, but that would have been an instinctual preference.

20:06.281 --> 20:10.966
And then I might question why I made that choice, and there are reasons for it.

20:10.986 --> 20:20.375
But I don't think the first draft of a novel is the same draft that you're doing the revision for.

20:20.535 --> 20:22.477
I will write it, and then I will complete it.

20:22.497 --> 20:24.419
Do you write in a word processor?

20:24.499 --> 20:27.142
No, I write in both hands.

20:27.162 --> 20:27.302
Really?

20:27.535 --> 20:40.547
Sometimes it's pencil and sometimes it's that gliby kind of, not felt tape, but there's a kind of pen that glides very easily over the paper, some form of roll top.

20:40.947 --> 20:48.074
So there will be a body of variant... There will be a body of extremely messy writing.

20:48.094 --> 20:51.277
But with the word processor there will be no variant versions.

20:51.497 --> 20:56.682
Well, of course, what happened, this time I transcribed onto a word processor rather than onto a typewriter.

20:57.235 --> 21:02.481
And it made me much more paranoid than usual, because I kept thinking I was going to lose it.

21:02.501 --> 21:05.544
So I kept having to print out all the versions.

21:05.645 --> 21:11.091
And it generated a much larger stack of paper than usual.

21:11.111 --> 21:20.782
Usually I would scribble out, and I would get those things, those strips that you type on, and then glue onto the page, stick onto the page.

21:20.802 --> 21:24.927
So I would end up with a small stack of paper.

21:25.788 --> 21:26.128
This looks huge.

21:26.598 --> 21:30.261
But, I mean, do you write the same on a machine as you might work?

21:30.282 --> 21:32.323
No, because I can't touch type.

21:32.343 --> 21:33.765
That's why I write in longhand.

21:34.025 --> 21:35.587
I never learn.

21:35.607 --> 21:36.628
I have to look at the letters.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.450
I'm always in a typewriter.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.551
I couldn't write.

21:40.571 --> 21:41.512
You couldn't write without it.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.475
And the word process, and I loved it.

21:44.755 --> 21:49.960
Well, I liked it because it made my typing look much better than it really is.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.422
I was able to correct and mistake.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.344
Oh, it looks like professional stuff.

21:54.364 --> 21:54.985
Yeah, it looks like.

21:55.724 --> 22:01.172
But it was more anxiety-inducing.

22:01.192 --> 22:03.415
I'd get paranoid about my manuscripts anyway.

22:04.237 --> 22:09.605
So I kept thinking, blackout, you know, everything will just vanish off my machine.

22:09.685 --> 22:13.550
But do you ever find that your ideas are running ahead of your hand?

22:14.892 --> 22:16.415
I write very quickly.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.096
You don't?

22:17.116 --> 22:18.137
I write very badly.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.561
Can you read your own writing?

22:20.581 --> 22:20.661
No.

22:20.681 --> 22:21.622
Most of the time I can't.

22:21.642 --> 22:22.744
But nobody else can.

22:23.382 --> 22:24.763
So I can't just hand it to the title.

22:24.823 --> 22:27.486
You realize what you're doing to scholars is the future.

22:27.566 --> 22:30.088
I mean, we were going to try and... And it fills me with glee.

22:30.208 --> 22:30.609
It does.

22:30.889 --> 22:32.310
Well, it will keep them very busy.

22:33.551 --> 22:36.674
Just think of all the work I'm creating, jobs of the future.

22:37.575 --> 22:42.940
What do you think of a guy like... Who is it?

22:42.960 --> 22:45.642
Who is it that just sold his working paper?

22:45.662 --> 22:46.764
Saul Bellow.

22:48.165 --> 22:51.668
Who actually put his papers up for auction, I think it was for one novel.

22:51.901 --> 22:54.544
And they fetched a pretty nice sum.

22:54.604 --> 23:01.733
I donate mine to the University of Toronto Library, but I got a tax write-up for it.

23:01.773 --> 23:03.976
They've taken that away, I think, from mine.

23:03.996 --> 23:05.918
In the state, but then I would have to sell them.

23:06.539 --> 23:06.940
You would?

23:07.280 --> 23:07.661
Oh, yeah.

23:08.862 --> 23:10.724
I wouldn't sell personal letters.

23:10.745 --> 23:14.549
But you'd sell them to scholars, or you'd sell them to collectors?

23:14.569 --> 23:15.230
No, no, scholars.

23:15.250 --> 23:20.777
You see, he put his up at an auction, and I don't know who got them, but...

23:21.196 --> 23:27.283
You know, some guy who prizes, you know, association stuff.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.626
Well, that would come under the heading of fetishism for me.

23:31.007 --> 23:47.845
I think in his case it was a statement, and Adele was great for statements, too, because I don't think he likes this whole industry of people who commit their lives to— Well, then why sell them at all, unless you wanted to know it?

23:48.888 --> 23:54.715
You know, he could have given them to an institution, like the University of Chicago or something like that.

23:54.735 --> 23:56.637
Well, I used to have feelings that way myself.

23:58.419 --> 24:05.267
But then I heard George Stony say something that made quite a lot of sense, which was, critics are the postmen to the future.

24:06.628 --> 24:07.569
That's a wonderful quote.

24:08.951 --> 24:17.140
You may, you new writers, you may rail against us, et cetera, but it is we who will eventually deliver your work to another generation.

24:17.727 --> 24:18.868
Maybe, maybe not.

24:18.948 --> 24:19.849
Maybe, maybe not.

24:20.350 --> 24:26.637
I mean, if it were up to the critics, Melville would be... But it was also critics that resurrected it.

24:26.657 --> 24:27.858
Resurrected in the 1920s.

24:27.878 --> 24:28.439
Yes.

24:29.760 --> 24:35.126
Now, by critics, I don't necessarily mean critics in the now.

24:35.466 --> 24:36.788
No, no critics in that.

24:36.808 --> 24:43.355
Criticism in general will come along and say to another generation, this is wonderful.

24:43.595 --> 24:46.198
I think of Norfolk Pride.

24:46.769 --> 24:54.226
resurrecting, like, major prophecies, which nobody's ever thought about in California.

24:56.472 --> 24:57.233
I'm going to wrap it up.

24:57.654 --> 24:58.416
Oh, really?
