00:02.444 --> 00:05.708
I'm talking to Chef Louis Zatmari.

00:05.748 --> 00:07.009
That's how we pronounce it, right?

00:07.650 --> 00:08.130
Wonderful.

00:08.150 --> 00:08.350
Zatmari.

00:08.370 --> 00:09.071
Zatmari.

00:11.434 --> 00:13.796
And you say everything in this, we're in a warehouse.

00:15.158 --> 00:18.201
It's a cavernous warehouse in Providence, Rhode Island.

00:19.562 --> 00:21.144
About 18,000 square feet.

00:21.164 --> 00:23.066
About 18,000 square feet.

00:24.047 --> 00:27.591
There's a long row of wooden columns.

00:28.432 --> 00:34.138
And apparently, is this the temporary location of the university archives?

00:35.239 --> 00:44.128
Johnston and Wales University, which is, as you have said, you told me on the phone, is about ready to burst forth for international recognition, in a sense.

00:44.148 --> 00:46.130
It's not only being burst forth.

00:47.111 --> 00:50.754
We have stood out from 61 nations from around the room.

00:51.795 --> 00:52.836
I think he was speaking.

00:52.856 --> 00:56.700
It's the largest school of Skype.

00:57.473 --> 00:59.816
But I think you were talking in terms of special collections.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.177
Oh, yes, that's correct.

01:01.197 --> 01:01.758
It was ready to emerge.

01:02.559 --> 01:03.460
That's correct.

01:03.600 --> 01:15.754
This collection is moving slowly but surely into another building where it will have a final destiny.

01:15.854 --> 01:19.558
Could you briefly tell me what is in this room?

01:19.578 --> 01:21.540
A mass.

01:21.925 --> 01:27.413
Well, I mean, what specifically... Okay, I have here a brochure, but we can give you a copy.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.295
Oh, you have a brochure.

01:28.315 --> 01:29.476
Yes, it will.

01:29.496 --> 01:49.266
And we have here what we believe is perhaps the world's largest collection of culinary and travel and food-related material.

01:50.208 --> 01:55.697
We speak of material.

01:55.857 --> 01:58.381
It's books, but it's all sorts of items.

01:58.842 --> 02:00.544
Well, it's not only books.

02:00.845 --> 02:14.727
It is books, manuscripts, pamphlets, postcards, trade catalogs, mail order catalogs.

02:14.747 --> 02:16.370
You have all these in the brochure.

02:16.410 --> 02:17.211
You will get it.

02:18.575 --> 02:21.379
18,000 postcards.

02:21.399 --> 02:22.521
18,000.

02:23.262 --> 02:30.453
On hotels, motels, restaurants, and related items.

02:30.474 --> 02:31.876
Where did you get all of these things?

02:33.759 --> 02:35.642
We'll get to that at some point.

02:37.785 --> 02:40.289
Now, these items here that I'm looking at, these items, right?

02:40.529 --> 02:41.511
Of course, everything.

02:41.731 --> 02:42.673
Everything here is yours.

02:42.693 --> 02:43.013
That's right.

02:43.550 --> 02:47.556
But I think— So this collection didn't really exist prior to your request.

02:47.576 --> 02:49.058
Is that—is that in love, right?

02:49.078 --> 02:49.559
No, no.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.223
It was absolutely zero, nothing.

02:52.884 --> 03:00.816
The university had a—had and has a fabulous book collection.

03:00.836 --> 03:01.958
Oh, this university, yes.

03:01.978 --> 03:04.902
The so-called Paul Fritchie Collection.

03:04.922 --> 03:06.945
Mm-hmm.

03:06.965 --> 03:08.207
And I think I—

03:13.233 --> 03:16.858
I should suggest to you that you look into it.

03:16.878 --> 03:19.802
Mr. Fritchie is dead, but you could talk to his widow.

03:21.164 --> 03:25.490
He was a fabulous, fabulous collector.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.232
Of culinary books?

03:27.252 --> 03:39.949
Cookbooks, culinary books, mainly cookbooks, and it is so interesting how through, not the years, but the decades, we bid

03:40.537 --> 03:45.584
against each other on auction so we both could give to this school.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.167
We both bid against each other.

03:49.048 --> 03:49.990
Not knowing.

03:50.350 --> 03:51.151
Not knowing.

03:51.171 --> 03:55.877
That when we will get a wood, we both will donate to the same school.

03:57.580 --> 03:58.541
That's a great story.

03:59.983 --> 04:01.345
How did he spell his name?

04:02.446 --> 04:03.187
Fritchi.

04:03.327 --> 04:07.192
You will get all the documentation we are prepared to give you on.

04:07.212 --> 04:08.434
Oh, that's wonderful.

04:09.005 --> 04:11.108
That makes it a lot easier for me.

04:11.128 --> 04:16.515
Well, we know that our time is money, and we assume that your time is money, too.

04:16.575 --> 04:19.459
That's right.

04:19.479 --> 04:20.620
But you knew this man?

04:20.780 --> 04:21.461
Was he a chef?

04:21.541 --> 04:26.167
Was he a restaurateur, or was he an entrepreneur who collected culinary books?

04:26.247 --> 04:32.235
He was an entrepreneur, a very wealthy man, a very elegant man who collected cookbooks.

04:32.255 --> 04:32.696
From where?

04:32.776 --> 04:34.198
Where was he from?

04:34.418 --> 04:38.303
He was from Rhode Island, but he lived in California.

04:38.536 --> 04:41.861
And when he collected the books, the school did not exist.

04:41.921 --> 04:44.525
When I collected the books, the school did not exist.

04:46.848 --> 04:53.097
But the school had a president who had a dream that someday he will have the largest collection.

04:53.117 --> 04:54.138
He didn't know how.

04:54.679 --> 04:55.000
Really?

04:56.482 --> 04:57.143
Yeah.

04:57.443 --> 05:00.107
You opened your restaurant in 1961, I gather.

05:00.167 --> 05:00.507
62.

05:00.548 --> 05:01.449
62.

05:02.971 --> 05:05.775
I know something of your background, so I won't...

05:06.751 --> 05:09.738
We won't have to go through a lot of the essentials.

05:09.758 --> 05:14.829
You could because it's better if you get from the horses smart than from the horses half.

05:14.889 --> 05:15.751
As long as you don't mind.

05:15.792 --> 05:16.513
No.

05:16.533 --> 05:20.322
I have all night and then... No, but we are going out to eat.

05:20.342 --> 05:23.950
We are taking our dinner reservation for you with you.

05:24.301 --> 05:26.244
And then we come back here.

05:26.264 --> 05:26.564
Okay.

05:26.765 --> 05:29.088
And when we come back, will you mind if I take a few photographs?

05:29.188 --> 05:30.851
I've got a camera on.

05:30.991 --> 05:31.432
No, no, no.

05:31.452 --> 05:34.456
Because I love this stuff in situ, as we say.

05:34.496 --> 05:34.736
Yes.

05:35.417 --> 05:40.024
Now, the very interesting thing, you've got all my bookshelves.

05:40.044 --> 05:41.026
These are your bookshelves?

05:41.206 --> 05:43.509
Every one of the bookshelves all over.

05:43.529 --> 05:46.594
And then you go, you don't see full over your chair.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.517
Okay.

05:48.537 --> 05:49.318
Look in here.

05:49.738 --> 05:50.119
Oh, boy.

05:50.159 --> 05:51.281
That's also all mine.

05:51.421 --> 05:52.823
And all around that wall.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.461
The bookshelves.

05:55.462 --> 05:56.664
Where did you keep this?

05:56.944 --> 05:58.446
Where did you keep all of this material?

05:58.626 --> 05:59.047
Okay.

05:59.687 --> 06:04.493
I owned and operated a small restaurant with 117 chairs.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.557
Really, the small U.S.

06:07.597 --> 06:13.784
restaurant is 135 chairs, so I was a little smaller than the small restaurant.

06:13.804 --> 06:18.430
But upstairs I had 17 apartments, 31 rooms for my books.

06:19.652 --> 06:21.153
But you kept all the rooms for yourself.

06:21.234 --> 06:22.455
You didn't rent any of the rooms.

06:22.688 --> 06:25.633
I campaigned for the books, not for myself.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.717
I didn't live there.

06:31.922 --> 06:34.146
I'm wondering, I mean, did you know the whole collection?

06:34.246 --> 06:35.748
Did you have a sense of what you had?

06:35.789 --> 06:39.154
Now, I understand 24,000 books went to Iowa.

06:39.174 --> 06:40.075
Yes, 22,000.

06:40.095 --> 06:46.846
And we have X thousand of items here, perhaps 40,000 items altogether, 40,000 or 50,000 items.

06:46.986 --> 06:50.772
The Hungarian collection is how large?

06:51.123 --> 07:02.518
About 15,000 girls right now, these days, as we are talking here, is going to University of Chicago, Regenstein Library.

07:02.899 --> 07:04.181
Okay, I'm going there, by the way.

07:04.361 --> 07:05.803
I'm going to Chicago next month.

07:06.344 --> 07:07.685
Yes, I will be there.

07:08.006 --> 07:09.728
And maybe we'll see each other again.

07:09.748 --> 07:10.710
Of course, yes, sure.

07:10.730 --> 07:16.998
Because I'm going to the University of Chicago, and I'm going to the Newbury, and I'm going to the Career Army, see Sam Rosenthal.

07:17.759 --> 07:18.480
You know Sam?

07:18.680 --> 07:23.748
He's the lawyer, the gentleman in his 90s, and he's a collector.

07:23.808 --> 07:35.645
I was just thinking of Bob Rosenthal, who was my dear friend and who was the curator of rare books at University of Chicago, and just died.

07:35.665 --> 07:36.226
Young man.

07:37.628 --> 07:41.113
My question, I guess, is, did you have a sense of what you had?

07:41.935 --> 07:47.623
Were you a collector with the idea that you were acquiring a vast volume of things?

07:48.262 --> 07:48.783
Okay.

07:49.243 --> 07:51.426
Did you know what you had?

07:51.827 --> 07:53.369
I do really have to go back.

07:53.529 --> 07:55.312
I want you to stand anywhere you want.

07:55.372 --> 07:59.938
My great-grandfather, whose name was Stephen Sottmary.

08:00.019 --> 08:00.439
Stephen?

08:01.020 --> 08:01.541
Sottmary.

08:01.561 --> 08:02.762
With a V or a PH.

08:03.183 --> 08:03.383
PH.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.927
Okay.

08:05.947 --> 08:15.901
He was a great and well-known book collector.

08:16.602 --> 08:17.323
Barbara

08:18.299 --> 08:26.391
Did you send him these?

08:26.971 --> 08:29.515
No, nothing.

08:29.535 --> 08:31.057
I had no chance yet to send anything.

08:31.358 --> 08:33.981
You can give everything.

08:34.402 --> 08:37.126
Oh, this is very, very important.

08:37.326 --> 08:40.971
I'm going to ask you to inscribe this.

08:41.292 --> 08:41.632
Sure.

08:41.793 --> 08:47.040
This is from our collection here.

08:47.780 --> 08:49.722
but you can feel that.

08:50.523 --> 08:52.205
Talking about Stephen Zatmari.

08:52.405 --> 08:52.685
Yes.

08:52.906 --> 08:54.587
And this was where, in Hungary?

08:54.848 --> 08:56.910
It was Hungary, in Transylvania.

08:57.270 --> 09:05.479
Actually, it was in a part, what was called the Partsiu, which was between Hungary and Transylvania.

09:05.499 --> 09:06.580
How do we spell Krasin?

09:07.161 --> 09:09.924
D-A-R-D-I-U-F.

09:12.387 --> 09:15.610
He lived there, and he was

09:16.535 --> 09:40.397
A very interesting person, he was, what should I say, a landowner or a farmer or a, you know, a farmer of Sagranthal, I guess, landowner or whatever you call it, who was buying books because he collected books.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.200
He was interested in the classics.

09:44.648 --> 10:03.610
And he was, you know, in the old times, the fine, great book dealers of the world always had a tiny sticker in the back of the book on the binding or the inside of the binding.

10:04.511 --> 10:13.761
So when I was a child and I looked at books and I listened to my grandfather, who was a great collector,

10:15.142 --> 10:24.712
And to my father, who was not such a great boy, because he lost one leg in the First World War, and we had to leave our home.

10:26.093 --> 10:30.578
And I was born on a cattle train.

10:31.499 --> 10:39.647
My mother said if I would be born at home, I would be born on the new wing.

10:40.538 --> 10:49.569
of our home, and the new wing was built before Columbus came here, but that's not the new wing, because it was newer than the old.

10:50.570 --> 10:57.899
We lived at the same place for 700 years, because we had no money to move, you know.

10:57.979 --> 11:08.892
Because that time, in that part of the world, just like in Greece, which is just on the other side of the same mountains, mountain range,

11:09.091 --> 11:10.633
People kind of didn't move.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.674
Why would they?

11:12.335 --> 11:15.399
They owned the mountain, they owned the road, they owned the building.

11:15.419 --> 11:16.280
Why should they move?

11:17.722 --> 11:23.169
Somebody moved and they married somebody in another place, so they had to edit.

11:24.551 --> 11:28.335
So I always sought his names of the book dealers.

11:29.116 --> 11:30.418
You always sought his name?

11:30.739 --> 11:33.462
The names of the book dealers in the books.

11:34.707 --> 11:37.450
I never saw my great-grandfather.

11:37.470 --> 11:42.055
He died before I was born, but I always saw his picture.

11:42.075 --> 11:45.419
He looked like Moshe Dayan, with one eye.

11:46.220 --> 11:58.733
Because when he had the big freedom fight in 1851, the fight was... Thank you very much.

12:00.455 --> 12:01.236
Thank you, buddy.

12:02.337 --> 12:04.680
And, you know, the other one, the...

12:05.183 --> 12:16.594
No, he has nothing, nothing.

12:16.954 --> 12:19.397
I don't have the books in Iowa.

12:19.417 --> 12:19.977
That's all right.

12:19.997 --> 12:20.878
I'll take care of that.

12:21.118 --> 12:22.199
Oh, okay.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.020
This is wonderful.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.804
All right, okay.

12:26.824 --> 12:33.570
And, you know, do you have any of that collector magazine with the

12:34.917 --> 12:37.820
Where I sit with the... Matt?

12:38.841 --> 12:41.184
I got one if I unpack those five.

12:41.224 --> 12:42.205
Don't unpack.

12:42.225 --> 12:43.507
It's time, really.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.350
We'll talk and I'll call you.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.514
So the best is if we go right now, don't you think so?

12:49.654 --> 12:51.175
What time is our reservation?

12:51.256 --> 12:53.518
We made a very early reservation.

12:53.538 --> 12:55.160
I'll call if we're ready.

12:55.180 --> 12:55.821
I told him I'd call.

12:55.861 --> 12:56.181
Check.

12:56.562 --> 12:56.802
Yes.

12:57.142 --> 12:58.203
It's just five right now.

12:58.223 --> 13:00.786
Yeah.

13:00.886 --> 13:03.169
We are going to a very good...

13:04.010 --> 13:08.436
owned and operated and run by this group.

13:08.456 --> 13:10.800
Oh, very nice.

13:10.820 --> 13:16.467
So I was born among books.

13:17.128 --> 13:18.250
You were born among books.

13:18.691 --> 13:24.118
And I grew up among books and among very bookish people.

13:24.138 --> 13:33.932
And I remember as a kid and as a young man, then we went on trips with my grandfather

13:34.790 --> 13:38.335
We always ended in box doors, wherever we went.

13:38.355 --> 13:41.238
Now, my grandfather was a railroad man.

13:41.338 --> 13:42.580
That's my father's father.

13:43.842 --> 13:57.720
And when he retired, just like all the European railroads, the Hungarian Railroad, was owned and operated by the Kingdom of Hungary, the Royal Hungarian Railroad.

13:57.740 --> 14:04.088
And we had the Austrian Railroad and the Greek Royal Railroad.

14:04.321 --> 14:08.885
the Greek Railroad, and the Serbian Railroad, and the Polish Railroad.

14:10.447 --> 14:32.927
And all these state-owned and run railroads had a reciprocal agreement that the top guys, when we retired, they could travel first class with one person accompanying me throughout the other railroads of Europe.

14:34.814 --> 14:43.405
So, you know, maybe not wealthy, but we could take a great advantage of this.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.586
We were three brothers.

14:45.928 --> 14:51.615
And my grandfather would get on the train in Budapest.

14:53.036 --> 15:01.507
And he and I went to Paris on the railroad station.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.230
We went upstairs and he introduced me to the...

15:04.868 --> 15:18.786
people there and we had rooms of eight beds and a big laguar with a big pitcher of cold water and we could stay there.

15:20.027 --> 15:21.709
I could sleep in one of the beds.

15:22.991 --> 15:33.424
And my grandfather took the train back to Budapest and brought my brother out who was twenty months younger than I.

15:34.113 --> 15:40.561
And when he arrived with my younger brother, then we traveled around in France.

15:40.581 --> 15:48.411
We just thought to pay for one person a few pennies for my kid brother.

15:48.851 --> 16:03.850
Many times when we went to the train station and we said, we have to, we said, you know, because he was hoping that when he will go to Budapest with his second child, he will say, what?

16:04.066 --> 16:07.211
And he would have to pay a few pennies.

16:07.231 --> 16:09.455
First of all, travel was cheap.

16:09.475 --> 16:23.177
Second, this was really cut rate, because my grandfather had a red pass, which was good for all the railroads, for two people, for no pay.

16:24.259 --> 16:28.926
So even if he would have to pay the total first pass for the third person,

16:29.294 --> 16:35.140
That's how you traveled and you did, you say you always went to bookstories.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.562
We traveled, we went to bookstories.

16:37.582 --> 16:55.080
So when I went with Barbara and Magda and with my two nieces, two Mike's brothers in London, then we— Maggie, that's the time for my M-A-G-G-S, and that's my typist.

16:55.100 --> 16:55.640
Oh, great.

16:55.660 --> 16:58.543
Oh, great.

16:58.563 --> 16:59.284
Excellent.

16:59.770 --> 17:08.140
I went with Barbie and Baba, my wife, to Max Brothers.

17:10.463 --> 17:17.872
Then we showed the children their great-great-grandfather's orders from 1804 to 1805.

17:18.793 --> 17:28.225
I told you this, so you see that, you see, when I was growing up,

17:28.745 --> 17:30.527
I know that W.A.

17:30.847 --> 17:51.231
Heck in Vienna, and, uh, uh, Edwards on Maryle Bowl Lane in London, and, uh, Israel in Amsterdam, and Rappaport in Rome are the Coke stores.

17:51.891 --> 17:55.055
The Reds in Paris, I suppose.

17:55.075 --> 17:55.415
Yes, yes.

17:55.436 --> 17:57.638
So, you know, uh,

17:58.377 --> 18:23.406
When I started to collect, I just wrote very polite short letters to these people that I am the son of Luis Satmari, the grandson of Luis Satmari, and the great-grandson of Stephen Satmari, and I collect agrarica just like my forebears, and I also collect

18:24.702 --> 18:26.625
What did your forebears collect?

18:26.645 --> 18:27.246
Hungarica?

18:28.067 --> 18:39.504
We collected classics, and we collected books that had to do with Hungarians, one way or the other, what is called in the trade, Hungarica.

18:39.524 --> 18:52.684
Books written on Hungarians, written by Hungarians, or Latin books translated by Hungarians, or medieval books.

18:52.833 --> 19:10.038
You know, in the 1400s we had famous Hungarian church authors who authored books of sermons which had been printed before 1500 in eleven, twelve cities, the same books.

19:10.398 --> 19:11.500
That's right.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.783
So, you know, these are.

19:14.084 --> 19:20.713
And then my grandfather collected beside this lots of

19:20.980 --> 19:22.542
books of natural history.

19:22.682 --> 19:25.466
He was very much interested.

19:25.486 --> 19:26.888
And what happened to his collection?

19:27.709 --> 19:30.633
Did he disperse it?

19:30.773 --> 19:31.875
Did you get any of it?

19:36.381 --> 19:37.623
How old are you?

19:37.743 --> 19:38.424
How old am I?

19:38.444 --> 19:38.584
47.

19:38.704 --> 19:38.924
47?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.006
Yeah.

19:40.026 --> 19:48.878
So you've been born in 1943.

19:49.735 --> 19:57.206
Oh, yeah, we had, in 43, we had about 40,000 books in our library.

19:57.226 --> 20:09.764
And then came something, what was called the end of the Second World War, and not too much left.

20:09.804 --> 20:11.867
Were they destroyed or stolen?

20:11.887 --> 20:12.949
Destroyed and stolen.

20:13.109 --> 20:13.349
Both.

20:13.730 --> 20:14.511
Just gone, yeah.

20:16.010 --> 20:20.296
Of course, you spent time in prison camps, so the least of you worries was books.

20:20.757 --> 20:35.738
No, no, but you see, we had the type of attitude, because we just simply had to.

20:36.298 --> 20:45.291
We've been forced by history and by nature to have the attitude then.

20:45.862 --> 20:52.709
and we looked up in another mirror, and we tried to look for an eye in the back of our head.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.512
You tried to look for an eye in the back of your head?

20:56.453 --> 21:06.943
And because we couldn't find any, we felt if God would want us to keep looking back, we would at least have one eye in the back.

21:07.584 --> 21:15.632
But because both of our eyes are not looking to the side or to the back, but from, that's the message that we should

21:16.777 --> 21:20.603
look forward, not backward.

21:21.044 --> 21:40.455
We really learned to write down what was gone, you know, and instead of crying on what we lost, we learned what to do to get something for the future.

21:41.043 --> 21:44.387
Now, you came here about 1951, I think.

21:44.407 --> 21:45.408
I came in 1951.

21:46.269 --> 21:47.891
I had one dollar and ten cents.

21:48.051 --> 21:49.072
I had fourteen books.

21:49.432 --> 21:50.854
I'm sorry, ten cents, you said?

21:51.314 --> 21:51.995
One dollar and ten cents.

21:52.015 --> 21:54.178
One dollar and ten cents, and fourteen books.

21:54.198 --> 21:54.618
Yes.

21:55.359 --> 21:57.401
Do you remember what those fourteen books were?

21:57.882 --> 22:00.304
I had a list of fourteen books.

22:00.585 --> 22:02.186
Are they still part of your archives?

22:03.228 --> 22:04.629
They are in my home, yeah.

22:04.649 --> 22:06.291
So those you still have?

22:06.423 --> 22:07.504
Oh, yes, yes.

22:07.524 --> 22:09.087
For those who haven't gone to Iowa.

22:09.147 --> 22:09.908
No, no, please.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.169
No, no, no.

22:11.370 --> 22:13.693
No, I mean, that's a significant question.

22:13.713 --> 22:30.395
Yeah, now, you see, I have an agreement with the University of Chicago that I have the right, I gave my entire Hungarian collection, but I have the right to keep up until my, quote, the miss, unquote.

22:30.856 --> 22:32.578
That's D-D-M-I-S-E.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.502
As many books as I want.

22:37.287 --> 22:41.791
You know, so probably a couple hundred books I will keep.

22:43.593 --> 22:45.375
These are very special books.

22:45.395 --> 22:47.637
Yeah, for some reason special to me.

22:49.539 --> 22:57.166
Just tell me what we're looking at.

22:57.527 --> 22:57.727
Okay.

22:57.967 --> 22:59.228
These are graters and grinders.

22:59.288 --> 23:01.150
This is like a nutcracker.

23:01.631 --> 23:02.612
That's for cherries.

23:03.032 --> 23:04.533
A lot of these are what we call food choppers.

23:04.553 --> 23:07.176
You can make salads or ground meats or sausages.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.594
That's a dual cherry pitter.

23:09.614 --> 23:11.278
It pits two cherries at once.

23:11.538 --> 23:12.981
That's for poppy seeds.

23:13.001 --> 23:16.488
And then we have spice mills and coffee grinders down on the bottom.

23:16.509 --> 23:20.837
Do these have any archival interest to you, or are they more curiosities?

23:20.857 --> 23:23.663
They do, because you see there's spinoffs to our book collection.

23:24.284 --> 23:26.008
This is an example of the...

23:26.225 --> 23:28.709
Enterprise, Philadelphia, 1897.

23:28.909 --> 23:35.039
This is titled The Enterprising Housekeeper, 1897, by Helen Louise Johnson.

23:35.059 --> 23:44.093
This was sold for 50 cents, so we can not only show you what the gadget looks like, but we have the paper background with recipes that come with it.

23:44.114 --> 23:53.228
What Barbara is showing me here is a lithographic illustration on the cover, and part of that illustration shows one of these blinders that she was just

23:53.647 --> 23:55.629
pointing out to me.

23:56.010 --> 23:56.811
And this is for juice.

23:57.932 --> 24:05.040
And if you want to make tomato juice, they had special ones that made juice, others that made the... And here's another one, the Universal Food Chapter.

24:05.060 --> 24:08.964
Now, the Universal is still sold today in delicatessens and grocery stores.

24:09.025 --> 24:10.767
In a hundred years, the design hasn't changed.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.289
It's the same.

24:13.590 --> 24:14.851
That is my sweater.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.493
I hung it up on a chair.

24:17.474 --> 24:18.195
It's 25 cents.

24:18.936 --> 24:20.798
That's a lot of money for a hundred years ago.

24:20.818 --> 24:21.679
Right.

24:21.997 --> 24:29.386
So we consider these books, and so what we try to do is either first we get the gadget, and then we look for the book, or we have the book and we look for the gadget.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.171
So we have either one of those.

24:33.491 --> 24:37.196
You know, I laughed when you were talking about.

24:37.216 --> 24:45.807
I think the last thing we were talking about, I was looking at all these massive items in the warehouse.

24:47.189 --> 24:51.514
And the first thing you said to me when we talked on the phone, you said, are you an MD?

24:52.102 --> 24:53.684
You asked me if I was a physician.

24:53.764 --> 24:54.045
Yes.

24:54.305 --> 24:57.649
And I was confused, but then you said, well, you know, we collectors are sick people.

24:57.669 --> 24:57.870
Yeah.

24:58.671 --> 25:08.644
And then I said, well, you know, the title of my book is A Gentle Madness, because it's not a sickness, but it certainly is an aberration of some sort.

25:08.804 --> 25:09.965
Oh, yes, it is.

25:09.985 --> 25:10.867
Definitely, yes.

25:11.507 --> 25:16.974
Tell me a little bit about, you mentioned that you come from a long line of collectors.

25:16.995 --> 25:17.235
Yes.

25:18.076 --> 25:19.678
That's an inherited madness.

25:20.283 --> 25:25.612
Some people would say it's not, but then again, you know, I think it's cultivated.

25:26.012 --> 25:35.808
Otherwise, why would so many people sell off their, you know, when Bradley Martin died, you know, his family sold off his library.

25:36.069 --> 25:43.461
It seems that collections, more often than not, do not pass on to the next generation.

25:43.681 --> 25:46.105
In your case, I have to believe it is because it was cultivated.

25:46.760 --> 26:13.881
You know, because of the nature of your book, and because I'm 72 years old, and I did spend all the time since you've been born in this mad field, I tell you a few very interesting things that I learned along the road.

26:14.333 --> 26:23.643
When J.P.

26:23.723 --> 26:41.843
Morgan invited once hundred of his friends to his yacht for a dinner on the yacht, one of the guests said to him, J.P., how much it costs to own a yacht like this?

26:42.818 --> 26:52.112
And he said, darling, if you have to know how much it costs, you can't afford it.

26:52.132 --> 26:57.039
You know why he had the yacht?

26:57.060 --> 27:02.468
What he really would want to have was a great library, but he couldn't afford it.

27:03.309 --> 27:06.053
So he settled for the yacht.

27:06.073 --> 27:07.395
But he had a great library.

27:09.198 --> 27:11.982
Not for himself.

27:12.738 --> 27:15.040
not for himself.

27:15.060 --> 27:21.987
He had a great library for the nation.

27:22.307 --> 27:27.252
But he enjoyed it, his son gave it, but I see your point here.

27:27.392 --> 27:38.203
The point is that the most expensive madness.

27:38.223 --> 27:41.226
Usually the suns sell off,

27:42.775 --> 27:47.141
the inheritors sell off the library.

27:53.550 --> 28:04.065
It is an interesting thing what you say that the inheritors sell off.

28:05.207 --> 28:12.377
It's psychologically understandable because they are jealous of the library.

28:12.965 --> 28:15.889
Sibling jealousy.

28:15.909 --> 28:19.433
Father spends too much cutting time with the books.

28:20.415 --> 28:25.081
Father spends too much time on the books.

28:25.101 --> 28:27.864
Father spends all his money on the books.

28:28.845 --> 28:33.712
Father is always with the books.

28:33.732 --> 28:35.694
Father wouldn't let us touch the books.

28:37.697 --> 28:40.480
So you know, how can we take revenge?

28:40.641 --> 28:42.583
Sad and hard books.

28:43.238 --> 28:47.464
You see this?

28:48.245 --> 29:04.530
In the old time, in the time when my forebears and the other collectors forebears collected books, the bedroom was not full of books from the floor to the ceiling.

29:04.550 --> 29:06.853
The books were in the library.

29:09.056 --> 29:12.161
They had their place.

29:12.181 --> 29:12.942
And because

29:13.276 --> 29:16.279
They've been in the library.

29:16.299 --> 29:24.268
They've been part of the household, not intruders.

29:25.569 --> 29:35.199
I've been in homes where the dining room couldn't be used for the last 17 years because it was full with the books.

29:35.219 --> 29:41.005
You know, at the guest bedroom, you couldn't get to the guest bed because it was full of the...

29:41.963 --> 29:44.286
Who are some of these people?

29:44.306 --> 29:45.048
Can you tell me?

29:45.108 --> 29:46.289
All kinds of people.

29:46.550 --> 29:51.737
But these are the people whose children they sell the books.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.062
You came to this country with 14 books.

29:55.242 --> 29:55.763
Yes.

29:56.404 --> 29:57.666
And you still have these books.

29:58.267 --> 29:59.829
I still have all 14.

30:01.852 --> 30:05.698
And you got to Chicago, I guess, you were here in the East Coast for a while.

30:05.738 --> 30:09.764
You mentioned to me that you spent some time in Worcester, as a matter of fact, you were teaching there.

30:10.345 --> 30:11.346
You were in Connecticut.

30:11.815 --> 30:24.070
You're an educator, and you spent some time teaching, and you started your restaurant, which was a tremendous success, which earned a great reputation.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.733
I'm giving a little summary here from what I know.

30:27.514 --> 30:28.115
Okay, I'm sorry.

30:29.296 --> 30:33.161
I'm just giving a brief recitation of what I know of your background.

30:34.482 --> 30:39.248
Your restaurant was celebrated by everyone who has visited it.

30:39.348 --> 30:40.810
I regret that I...

30:41.735 --> 30:46.342
I've never had a chance to... I really don't expect that much time in Chicago.

30:46.402 --> 30:51.830
But my point is, I wonder at what point did you start becoming a collector?

30:52.852 --> 31:05.331
A hopeless collector who acquired thousands upon thousands of books and postcards and manuscripts and devices and presidential letters and Hungarian items.

31:05.952 --> 31:09.818
There seems to have been no limit to your appetite for these items.

31:10.777 --> 31:38.387
Maybe you can just give me some insight and start anywhere you'd like and just talk and... The first time I went to New York, with the small remains of my first paycheck, I went to the Marlborough bookstore in the corner of 42nd Street and Broadway.

31:38.722 --> 32:04.611
and I bought for 19 cents Ludwig Bammelmann's book whose name I know because a friend who came a year ahead of me to the United States took me to Ludwig Bammelmann's restaurant in New York

32:06.262 --> 32:07.343
Thank you.

32:07.503 --> 32:09.044
I just wanted to clarify the salmon.

32:09.064 --> 32:10.866
You just wanted a salmon appetizer?

32:11.006 --> 32:17.752
The cold smoked salmon appetizer with the capers and lemon and chocolate.

32:17.872 --> 32:21.816
I just wanted to make sure.

32:23.017 --> 32:24.658
Thank you.

32:24.678 --> 32:25.739
Ludwig Bommelman.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.901
He was a restaurateur.

32:27.921 --> 32:28.662
And writer.

32:28.802 --> 32:29.322
And writer.

32:29.342 --> 32:30.644
Very successful writer.

32:31.224 --> 32:35.728
Most of his pieces appeared in the New Yorker magazine.

32:36.367 --> 32:38.950
And then he collected them into books.

32:42.135 --> 32:43.597
So, what kind of a book was this?

32:43.617 --> 32:45.660
This was a cookbook that you bought?

32:45.680 --> 32:47.662
No, it was a part of his life.

32:48.343 --> 32:53.029
He wrote several books about himself.

32:53.049 --> 32:55.693
Very interesting, lovely books.

32:55.713 --> 32:58.657
Now, did you already own your restaurant on this trip?

32:58.677 --> 32:59.178
Oh, no.

32:59.238 --> 33:03.403
That was when I got my first paycheck when I arrived here.

33:03.423 --> 33:06.087
Started to live.

33:06.775 --> 33:12.942
Had you decided at that point that you would be involved in the food business?

33:13.342 --> 33:13.662
Yes.

33:15.745 --> 33:19.349
And I also... You see, the thing is this.

33:19.529 --> 33:23.233
I started to collect books when I was a kid.

33:23.373 --> 33:25.255
I just didn't call it collecting.

33:25.355 --> 33:26.376
I just was buying books.

33:31.882 --> 33:34.605
My favorite pastime was reading.

33:34.855 --> 34:01.521
as a kid buy ebooks

34:01.720 --> 34:03.904
From the first time you arrived here?

34:03.944 --> 34:04.224
Yes.

34:07.890 --> 34:26.660
At some point, however, you're collecting with focus and with purpose, and to harken back to the J.P.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.403
Morgan story.

34:28.973 --> 34:30.956
You're spending a lot of money.

34:31.016 --> 34:32.598
Would you like to?

34:34.721 --> 34:56.972
What I learned in America was that it is true that time is money.

34:57.712 --> 35:26.537
and when I was young and poor and worked on not high paying jobs I had lots of time so I could spend the whole day in a Salvation Army basement with the books and after

35:26.737 --> 35:28.599
sitting there for six, seven hours.

35:28.720 --> 35:37.291
I came out with three books for five cents each.

35:37.311 --> 35:49.546
Later on, when I had very good jobs and I was highly paid, I couldn't spend five or eight hours in a bookstore.

35:49.566 --> 35:50.888
But I went to work

35:51.678 --> 35:56.562
After I left my job, in the evening I took a second job.

35:57.383 --> 35:58.644
Hello, how are you?

35:59.465 --> 36:08.372
I worked very hard, and in five minutes I spent that money on books.

36:08.392 --> 36:10.254
Did you take these books home and read them right away?

36:10.274 --> 36:12.376
Have you ever bought books that you haven't read?

36:12.636 --> 36:15.458
Yes.

36:15.499 --> 36:16.219
Tell me about that.

36:16.539 --> 36:20.723
What prompts you to do something like that?

36:21.513 --> 36:25.818
I guess I'm trying to get into the personality and the psyche of the collection.

36:25.838 --> 36:32.266
I'm really trying to establish, you know, there's no question that you're a discriminating and appreciative reader.

36:33.748 --> 36:38.354
Yes, but you see, the thing is, what's your religion?

36:38.714 --> 36:39.435
Yeah, right.

36:39.515 --> 36:40.596
What's your religion?

36:41.057 --> 36:41.938
I'm sorry?

36:41.958 --> 36:42.939
What is your religion?

36:43.039 --> 36:44.802
I'm a Greek Orthodox.

36:44.822 --> 36:47.305
Are you familiar with the Bible?

36:47.325 --> 36:48.566
To a degree.

36:48.586 --> 36:50.929
Did you ever heard about King Solomon?

36:51.871 --> 36:53.112
Of course.

36:53.132 --> 36:57.196
You know that he had 700 wives and 300 concubines?

36:57.516 --> 36:58.317
I don't know.

36:58.397 --> 37:05.243
I don't think he would have any... 1,000 wives he had.

37:05.263 --> 37:14.191
I don't know if he read me.

37:14.791 --> 37:15.892
You know what I mean?

37:16.172 --> 37:17.413
I don't respect the question.

37:17.473 --> 37:18.054
Okay.

37:19.115 --> 37:19.595
Okay.

37:20.216 --> 37:21.557
So...

37:21.858 --> 37:33.751
When you bet on the horse race, you bet for win, for place, for show.

37:34.812 --> 37:44.162
When you buy books, you buy some books to read, some buy books to own, and some books for reference.

37:46.364 --> 37:47.866
I agree 100%.

37:48.046 --> 37:50.869
You want to possess

37:51.052 --> 37:51.633
the books.

37:51.693 --> 37:54.076
You want to own them.

37:54.096 --> 37:57.601
You want to own them.

37:57.621 --> 38:03.529
And that's what makes the difference.

38:03.609 --> 38:10.458
Perhaps you buy every book with the hope that you will read it.

38:10.778 --> 38:19.590
And I would say that most of the books I bought, I know pretty much what is in them.

38:20.127 --> 38:23.399
Even if I didn't read it.

38:24.423 --> 38:26.049
Well, you knew what you were buying, in other words.

38:26.230 --> 38:26.511
Yes.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.840
You knew the importance of what you were buying.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.125
Almost all the time, not all the time.

38:30.145 --> 38:31.470
Well, Winston Churchill said,

38:32.513 --> 38:42.276
He said it's not important for a gentleman, and regrettably, book collectors traditionally have men and very few women, and there are all kinds of reasons and studies for that.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.364
But he said it's very important for a gentleman.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.572
It's not important that a gentleman read every book in his library.

38:48.612 --> 38:50.877
What is important is that he knows what he has,

38:51.194 --> 38:56.402
and where he can find it and how it can help him when he needs to know that.

38:56.482 --> 38:57.924
Get me a little sugar.

38:57.944 --> 38:58.405
Sugar?

38:59.707 --> 38:59.927
Sure.

38:59.967 --> 39:00.848
Absolutely.

39:00.929 --> 39:03.833
What do I have and how can it help me when I need it?

39:03.953 --> 39:05.736
You know, I've got 10 or 15,000.

39:05.756 --> 39:06.897
That's where it is.

39:06.917 --> 39:08.981
I've got 10 or 15,000 books at home.

39:09.241 --> 39:10.743
What books you cook?

39:12.225 --> 39:13.187
I'll shut this up.

39:14.769 --> 39:20.678
I don't know what the... Thank you.

39:21.552 --> 39:27.902
I don't know if you put a monetary value on your collection.

39:29.144 --> 39:30.566
It's not really relevant to me.

39:30.586 --> 39:34.292
I'm sure you know what you put into it and you know what it's worth.

39:34.452 --> 39:47.492
You have some idea what it might command on the Sotheby's or Christie's, but you've seen fit to give it, to put it in good hands and pass it on.

39:48.164 --> 39:49.426
This is correct, is it not?

39:49.446 --> 39:50.848
It is, absolutely.

39:50.868 --> 39:52.771
But I'm putting words in there about it.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.672
No, no, no.

39:53.712 --> 39:55.455
You know what you are talking about.

39:55.975 --> 40:15.724
The thing, the very interesting thing, that several people, when they heard that I gave the books here, they said, ah, talks writer.

40:16.514 --> 40:36.224
You don't realize that a person like me could not, under any circumstances, earn enough money to deduct a donation like this.

40:39.769 --> 40:42.133
Well, it's not a tax write-off anymore anyway.

40:42.350 --> 40:47.257
No, because, you know, it is a ridiculously small amount.

40:48.359 --> 40:49.100
Would you like some of this?

40:49.120 --> 40:50.562
Thank you.

40:50.582 --> 40:51.683
And yes, you do.

40:53.266 --> 40:54.628
You go through the motions.

40:56.390 --> 40:56.550
Why?

40:56.771 --> 40:59.595
Because the school needs it for insurance purposes.

41:02.399 --> 41:03.040
You know?

41:03.060 --> 41:04.261
Right.

41:05.223 --> 41:11.732
And you need it for yourself, for your records.

41:12.337 --> 41:30.401
Well, no, you see, one reason that this is now a new era for the book collector, for a while there, the institutions were getting all the good stuff, but the government wrote off that book, closed that book, so now it behooves the collector to sell his stuff as opposed to giving it to institutions.

41:31.482 --> 41:39.252
So really, anyone who suggests that you're doing this for tax write-off is not aware of what's happened in the world of rare books in the last 10 or 15 years.

41:39.312 --> 41:39.913
That's right.

41:40.501 --> 41:45.607
You stand to gain nothing by giving these things away.

41:45.627 --> 41:46.108
I know that.

41:46.488 --> 41:47.630
You don't have to explain this to me.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.552
I know that.

41:49.572 --> 41:56.921
So there has to be a higher purpose, a higher motivation for you to do what you're doing.

41:56.961 --> 42:09.816
And I'd kind of like you to articulate that a little bit for me.

42:10.724 --> 42:39.752
I was on a track with you I think about the decision at what point to

42:39.901 --> 42:52.698
you know, give up your, it's almost like sending your children off into the wilderness, you know, to send your books off to these institutions.

42:52.718 --> 43:06.837
Well, I was about 20 years old when I first thought

43:07.728 --> 43:19.142
of myself was collecting books, not buying books or collecting books.

43:19.162 --> 43:31.077
And somehow, although I lost all what I get together during the second book... These are things that you collected in... Yes, in harmony.

43:32.979 --> 43:35.322
And then I collected books in...

43:35.605 --> 43:48.657
Austria where I lived seven years after the war and I had to kiss goodbye to them because I had no money and no way to get the books out except my tongue.

43:50.559 --> 43:55.583
And as I told you, I came with one dollar ten cents.

43:56.104 --> 43:59.427
Okay, one dollar ten cents and fourteen books, and I don't mean to interrupt.

43:59.447 --> 44:00.208
Yeah.

44:00.228 --> 44:03.511
But you made a selection, you picked fourteen books from what you had.

44:03.611 --> 44:05.072
There was, I really loved it.

44:05.542 --> 44:07.064
Tell me a little bit about that.

44:07.124 --> 44:09.748
How did you pick these 14?

44:09.929 --> 44:19.423
Probably at that time, I had 200 books.

44:19.443 --> 44:28.918
And I thought, I'd definitely take my Bible.

44:28.938 --> 44:34.266
And it's a Bible, there's nothing, it's not a... What I get was a child.

44:34.634 --> 44:48.841
I received it as a child and I hunted my boy with me as a soldier through the war.

44:48.861 --> 44:56.575
Then I had three books of Mozart.

44:57.061 --> 45:00.246
that I bought in Salzburg.

45:00.267 --> 45:16.234
Then I had great Hungarian poets, poetry books, two that I had since my childhood and my mother sent them after me.

45:16.568 --> 45:27.255
and fear for what I bought after the war from other immigrants in Austin.

45:27.495 --> 45:34.172
And that was pretty much what I had to do.

45:34.709 --> 45:47.638
And I felt, these are the books, what I would want, the greatest Algerian poets.

45:49.087 --> 45:52.873
Let's see.

45:52.893 --> 46:03.449
I mean, I have poetry books, but the whole Hungarian nation agreed that these are the greatest poems.

46:03.469 --> 46:09.137
And I have some books of poetry, but I felt these are the greatest poems.

46:09.556 --> 46:26.856
please help yourself would you like another glass

46:26.836 --> 46:39.150
So, I still have these 40 books.

46:40.051 --> 46:46.058
Did it hurt you to leave any books behind?

46:47.260 --> 46:48.361
Very badly.

46:48.381 --> 46:50.143
Did you decide that the number was 40?

46:50.123 --> 46:52.568
No, no, no.

46:52.748 --> 46:58.279
I had so much room there.

46:58.499 --> 47:01.385
Yes, that's all right.

47:01.465 --> 47:09.280
We will bring us as much as we need.

47:09.260 --> 47:19.075
You know, I think this is so thick water, so basic.

47:22.721 --> 47:23.201
Sorry.

47:24.263 --> 47:26.847
No, come on.

47:27.012 --> 47:35.810
This is Africa.

47:35.830 --> 47:43.907
This is just so good.

47:45.237 --> 48:05.845
Then one of the guests who used to eat at the bakery said to me, listen, this is one which is just a little bit larger and it stops when you stop to speak and it starts with a voice.

48:06.314 --> 48:10.180
activated and it is marvelous.

48:10.321 --> 48:13.185
I hope this has never touched it yet.

48:13.205 --> 48:13.826
Yeah, but you know what?

48:13.967 --> 48:18.414
In a place like this with people talking, I have that feature on this.

48:18.694 --> 48:28.571
We'll just keep going.

48:28.811 --> 48:29.993
Thank you.

48:31.120 --> 48:37.589
Did Barbara came with the collection or the collection came with Barbara?

48:38.590 --> 48:49.365
Because Barbara worked in the collection for 18 years.

48:49.852 --> 48:55.319
What's the capacity of opportunity?

48:56.760 --> 49:03.769
So, Chef Louis actually had a curator with a CEO of our collection.

49:03.789 --> 49:03.969
Right.

49:03.989 --> 49:08.174
Did you advise on purchases, sort of catalogs, all of the above?

49:09.216 --> 49:11.979
Well, advising, we looked at catalogs together.

49:12.139 --> 49:13.581
I would look and point something out.

49:14.262 --> 49:19.268
And a lot of times, I would buy something on my own for my own collection and bring it in.

49:19.248 --> 49:28.760
end up selling it to him or giving it to him because he didn't have it.

49:28.920 --> 49:38.232
It did belong there, no question.

49:38.252 --> 49:42.177
How did you come together?

49:42.237 --> 49:45.441
She was a little girl that

49:45.421 --> 49:49.789
She became a Dr. Dhabha.

49:57.002 --> 50:05.978
She became a member of the family.

50:05.958 --> 50:21.992
How did you decide what went here and what went to Iowa?

50:21.972 --> 50:38.327
Basically, Iowa doesn't want anything but a cookbook.

50:38.487 --> 50:51.979
I have an agreement with the chief at the end of Iowa.

50:51.959 --> 51:09.602
And I think it was in the third or fourth year of our agreement that the Chief Liberia retired.

51:09.622 --> 51:20.616
And we get a new Chief Liberia, a darling lovely lady.

51:20.596 --> 51:35.694
And when we talked, and I said, well, next year, they will start to give you all the cooking magazines and all the menus.

51:35.714 --> 51:38.497
That's here.

51:38.517 --> 51:39.138
To Iowa.

51:39.599 --> 51:41.961
That's our connection.

51:41.981 --> 51:43.363
Then she said, well,

51:43.343 --> 51:52.373
Actually, we would like to be very selective.

51:52.393 --> 52:01.482
We would like to have your presidential autographs, but not the rest.

52:01.502 --> 52:07.849
We would like to have your original steel engravings

52:07.829 --> 52:21.828
and woodblocks up to the 19th century, to the 18th century, but no better.

52:21.948 --> 52:34.225
And I said to her, you know, you kind of want to collect the cream,

52:34.492 --> 52:39.797
and leave me the skim milk.

52:42.339 --> 52:43.100
Sort of.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.662
In a manner of speaking.

52:45.422 --> 52:56.853
So we made a very, very amicable, friendly agreement that we stopped with the 22,000 croquants.

52:56.873 --> 53:00.176
The starting start.

53:00.196 --> 53:00.416
Yes, start.

53:00.436 --> 53:02.338
Then since here, you see,

53:02.318 --> 53:22.993
The whole idea of Iowa came up because in Chicago was a legendary Hungarian book finder, book designer family.

53:24.323 --> 53:43.513
The Kner family, K-N-E-R, they've been working with books for five generations in Hungary.

53:44.101 --> 53:45.143
generation.

53:46.945 --> 54:03.932
The great grandparents of his brother and sister who lived in Chicago was a wandering Jew, a bookbinder who went from

54:04.250 --> 54:24.007
castle to castle, from parish to parish, from church to church, and bind the books for the minister, for the priest, for the count, whoever had some books for binding.

54:24.268 --> 54:33.936
Then the son opened a little bindery and started to print forms

54:35.047 --> 54:40.052
for payments and bills.

54:40.452 --> 54:43.175
Business forms.

54:43.195 --> 54:43.755
Business forms.

54:43.976 --> 54:50.562
The grandson started to print more.

54:50.582 --> 55:03.214
And the great grandson made so much money on print business forms and other things that

55:03.548 --> 55:14.946
As a laborer's love, he started to publish magnificent little books designed by the best book designers.

55:15.708 --> 55:25.303
And he sent his children to the best schools to learn the art of book designing, the art of graphic design.

55:25.283 --> 55:33.160
And these were the people who have been my friends in Chicago.

55:33.461 --> 55:44.845
And the female member of the family who never get married, Elizabeth Nell, who was one of the foremost known bookbinders in Hungary.

55:44.825 --> 56:05.803
who is still alive and is 94 or 95 year old kner unfortunately she is not in the best mental capacity but when you come to chicago i promise you if she is in that

56:05.783 --> 56:15.355
Stage of mine in October I'll take you to that because you never sign anything like that and

56:17.208 --> 56:26.007
She went in business with an Irish bookbinder who learned his trade in England.

56:27.169 --> 56:35.207
And I heard a Kalapinus dictionary.

56:35.227 --> 56:37.191
Kalapinus was a Jesuit.

56:37.171 --> 57:05.963
who in the 1500s wrote a Latin dictionary on the 10 best known languages of that age, what being the 10 most important languages in 1590, which been, of course the dictionary was in Latin.

57:05.943 --> 57:09.608
And he opened up every word was in love.

57:09.788 --> 57:28.575
And it showed each word in Greek, in French, in German, in Spanish, in Hungarian, in English.

57:30.023 --> 57:35.452
Two more languages.

57:36.313 --> 57:48.252
And I have a copy of this book which was stolen from a castle by a Soviet soldier.

57:48.232 --> 57:51.240
for its cover.

57:51.721 --> 58:03.692
It had an early 18th century binding that the soldiers throw out and throw away the books.

58:03.672 --> 58:13.401
This Elizabeth Kner rebounded for me so that it opened flat on every page.

58:13.421 --> 58:25.473
But this is a book, a large folio size, printed in Switzerland in 1596.

58:25.973 --> 58:29.697
And the Russian one is the cover?

58:29.677 --> 58:51.381
the russian turkey probably it was not russian soviet soldier but that's what i said you know but anyhow that kind of strengthened my friendship with her partner whose name was william anthony bill anthony

58:51.361 --> 59:09.842
And when Bill Anthony get a job as a book restorer at the University of Iowa, and the University of Iowa

59:10.615 --> 59:27.139
yet as a present, the Martin collection, M-A-R-T-I-N, Dr. Martin, which is perhaps one of the best medical libraries in the United States.

59:27.199 --> 59:34.751
Medical books from the late 1400s, early 1500s, early 1600s.

59:35.652 --> 59:39.137
And then I saw that list, I realized

59:39.438 --> 59:48.109
that I have many books written by the same authors as cookbooks, as he has medical books.

59:49.451 --> 01:00:04.129
And I had, oh, I don't know, probably three dozen, four dozen books from 1475 till 1630 or so.

01:00:04.582 --> 01:00:22.691
So I said, Bill, if you are there on the faculty as a book restorer, I'll give my books to the University of Iowa.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.514
Couldn't be at a better place.

01:00:26.468 --> 01:00:27.770
You know?

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:38.506
And it will make a terrific match with the Martin books.

01:00:38.526 --> 01:00:47.439
And we have the best relationship on your will guide on cancer of the liver.

01:00:49.342 --> 01:00:54.990
Last year.

01:00:55.190 --> 01:01:00.120
and the chief librarian retired, and the new librarian.
