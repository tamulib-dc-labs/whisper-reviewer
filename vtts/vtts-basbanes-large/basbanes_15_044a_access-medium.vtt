WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:03.513
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Creeley.

00:03.853 --> 00:09.199
I've got, as you can see, I've got three books here.

00:09.219 --> 00:17.388
I've got your collected poems from 1975, and I even put a little plastic thing on it, that's how much I value it.

00:17.408 --> 00:21.653
You've collected essays, and interestingly, the selected poems of Charles Olson.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.216
It is an interesting kind of a, you know,

00:24.888 --> 00:26.990
collection of works here, isn't it?

00:27.010 --> 00:33.836
This last of the Charles Olson's, Charles the Selected Poems, is really—that was an incredible responsibility.

00:33.896 --> 00:35.217
Well, let's start with that.

00:35.277 --> 00:45.587
Well, I was thinking, particularly being here in Worcester, that aspect or that fact of his life gets curiously muted.

00:46.628 --> 00:52.313
In some ways, I remember growing up in a small town with Jackson, not that far from here.

00:53.339 --> 01:05.936
And it wasn't even that one thought about it, so to speak, but the sense of that vast and various world out there was the lure, especially, I think, during the Depression years.

01:05.956 --> 01:13.687
But in any case, the sense of wanting to find it and make something of oneself was a classic boyhood imagination.

01:13.767 --> 01:22.198
So I think what happens with Charles, in part, is that when he leaves Worcester, and I now realize when his mother, after his father's death, also leaves,

01:23.140 --> 01:33.114
that the kind of occasion or sense of place to come back to or stay located in must have gone to was going to Wesleyan.

01:33.154 --> 01:50.278
I remember it's mentioned in Edward Cronin's piece in the paper, but in any case the point that when Charles goes off to Wesleyan he's got a suitcase with all the labels on it, and apparently

01:50.815 --> 02:07.317
He did it, I think, some, I was talking to Frank Quinn, who was here for years, fellow poet, and he told me that he in turn talked to someone who'd gone to college with Charles and wondered what all the labels signified, but apparently they were literally labels.

02:07.457 --> 02:07.898
They weren't.

02:08.098 --> 02:09.380
They didn't argue.

02:09.400 --> 02:19.573
No, no, no, but it was his way of trying to front his own shyness or his own vulnerability, really.

02:19.925 --> 02:22.170
That was always the curious double in him.

02:22.190 --> 02:31.610
On the one hand I've never had a friend or known anyone more able to move in the terms of the world.

02:31.650 --> 02:39.807
I mean Charles came into a place like this without any kind of overt glad-handing or charming, no pitch.

02:40.377 --> 02:48.187
But within a day or within an hour, people would be clustered around him as though he were sort of a beast coming around the honey.

02:48.207 --> 02:50.069
Was that the power of the poet?

02:50.410 --> 02:53.313
He was an immensely attractive person.

02:54.555 --> 03:03.326
And that gets curiously, it's hard to represent, because at times he seems belligerent and gets angry.

03:03.426 --> 03:05.208
He's not easy, so to speak.

03:05.229 --> 03:09.574
He seems at times difficult to quote, understand, unquote.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.020
He was immensely attracted to people.

03:12.040 --> 03:19.191
I remember one time in Vancouver, we'd been... I love the way you point north.

03:19.211 --> 03:20.032
Yeah, it was up that way.

03:20.072 --> 03:33.552
We used to... We were given, we could have our lunch in the faculty club that the university had, and it was sort of old-style English decor and feel to it.

03:33.572 --> 03:37.958
It was very kind of, not formal, but it was very solid, real lunch.

03:38.714 --> 03:45.944
And so we used to have these meals there in the breaks of the activity we were otherwise involved with.

03:45.964 --> 03:55.157
And the waiters were principally persons working, you know, students working in college and working their way through school.

03:55.177 --> 04:02.127
So I remember that was the fact that you couldn't go out on this little balcony because the waiters weren't committed to go out to bring you food.

04:03.048 --> 04:08.215
And I remember Charles characteristically said, that's no problem, we'll meet you at the door and take it.

04:08.650 --> 04:14.117
Because it was so pleasant to sit down on this balcony, and there was no rule against doing it, just one couldn't be served there.

04:14.157 --> 04:15.819
So we could try to make that better.

04:16.580 --> 04:20.245
And in any case, this fellow waited on us consistently all the week.

04:21.246 --> 04:29.817
And I remember when we were now to leave, particularly the child, he said, I've just quit my job, it will never be the same.

04:29.837 --> 04:38.067
And, I mean, if you read Charles Bohr's account of him living in Connecticut, called Charles Olson in Connecticut,

04:38.603 --> 04:51.257
I mean, Charles would, he finally ends up living in the upstairs part of a small sort of restaurant inn, and literally they're bringing him his meals up the stairs.

04:51.457 --> 05:08.155
And that was not just sort of indulgence or something he paid for, but he was immensely attractive in that way, and people would really, you know, I remember being at dinner with him once, and this was a very Pukka British Hotel dining room, the Connett Hotel in London.

05:08.978 --> 05:12.302
And we were there, three or four of us would come in late.

05:12.362 --> 05:18.531
Charles, the manager, walks down the hall with us and sits on the seats and all this stuff.

05:19.452 --> 05:31.427
And finally, when it's time to leave, Charles has managed to secure seven of the waiters, all seven waiters, by talking to him about the Tarot Pact, the Italian Tarot Pact.

05:31.447 --> 05:32.589
They're all Italian.

05:32.609 --> 05:36.454
They're on the Genoa deck or the Marse deck or whatever.

05:37.042 --> 05:44.231
In the meantime, there were all these other people waiting to get their bills and get out of there.

05:45.332 --> 05:49.097
But that's the effect he could have.

05:50.198 --> 05:55.445
And I guess partly people were made curious by his physical size.

05:56.746 --> 06:01.652
But I've known other tall men, James Laughlin, the New Direction Publisher.

06:01.692 --> 06:06.238
There are tall men and women who don't have that particular

06:06.944 --> 06:14.311
When you started, you mentioned the responsibility that you felt in doing the collection.

06:14.331 --> 06:20.338
Well, the sad fact, the sad and absolute fact is, of course, that he can't do it himself.

06:20.498 --> 06:25.523
But his work has been published.

06:28.225 --> 06:33.711
Yeah.

06:35.463 --> 06:48.101
Why do you think a selection was in order at this point?

06:48.121 --> 06:49.443
Well, several reasons.

06:49.563 --> 06:51.206
One was that the—I'm giving you milk.

06:51.226 --> 06:52.027
I hope that's all right.

06:52.047 --> 06:52.608
Do you want it?

06:52.628 --> 06:53.069
That's fine.

06:53.249 --> 06:54.471
Or I think you can give me this one.

06:54.491 --> 06:55.232
No, that's fine.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.614
I can drink it either way.

06:56.714 --> 06:58.496
Just no sugar.

06:59.698 --> 07:03.023
I think the—well, several factors seem to me.

07:04.437 --> 07:22.336
One was that literally the cost and physical bulk of the two primary editions, whether the Maximus poems or the collected poems, they were not casually obtained.

07:23.497 --> 07:25.399
The Maximus is big.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.122
It's big.

07:28.162 --> 07:29.844
It's a great book in that fact.

07:29.904 --> 07:32.487
The scale really is part of it.

07:33.192 --> 08:00.476
But the point was that if I was trying to attract someone who may not have read Maximus poems, or trying to think of what's this all about, or the young, frankly, or simply people, I wanted a book that would be less intimidating in its physical character, and also less expensive, and simpler to move with, to locate the person in, is what I'm saying.

08:00.496 --> 08:02.338
Is there a hope?

08:02.707 --> 08:10.378
I know that you pick up the New York Times, and I don't know how infrequently you see poetry reviewed.

08:10.979 --> 08:17.328
The University of California Press is also facing severe financial cutbacks.

08:17.469 --> 08:30.047
I don't think they're going to dump the book, so to speak, but their ability to locate and distribute the book is probably not as terrific as it might have been.

08:31.293 --> 08:38.000
I think it's a book that will, not ambitiously on my part, I think it's a book that will travel.

08:38.881 --> 08:55.680
And I think it begins to read Olson from the point of view of a reader rather than the point of view of either a critic or simply a devoted friend.

08:55.998 --> 08:59.403
analyze him or make judgments of that kind at all.

08:59.424 --> 09:01.487
But I was really doing a very old-fashioned thing.

09:01.567 --> 09:07.757
I was including those poems that moved me particularly and consistently.

09:07.777 --> 09:18.494
I literally sat down with the two major collections of his poetry and turned pages, and that one, I always remember that one, put that in.

09:19.215 --> 09:20.858
I didn't try, I had no program.

09:21.412 --> 09:22.994
Did you work from edited texts?

09:23.314 --> 09:27.118
Yeah, I worked from George Butterick's two volumes.

09:27.639 --> 09:33.966
There was the third that George had also edited, A Nation of Nothing But Poetry.

09:34.987 --> 09:36.709
And I was, yeah, I looked through it.

09:37.129 --> 09:38.571
So you weren't editing, per se?

09:39.091 --> 09:41.954
No, I wasn't doing the scholarly situation of editing.

09:42.074 --> 09:43.936
You were doing a selection.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.918
I was doing a selection.

09:45.938 --> 09:49.242
And I wanted a selection that would be of a scale.

09:50.133 --> 10:02.329
And an economy that would, as I say, travel comfortably and lightly would not be the heavy authority of the otherwise available poems.

10:03.090 --> 10:09.459
There's no one who's going to walk into a bookstore and casually pick up the Maximus poems and pay for it.

10:09.619 --> 10:19.853
Do you see Olsen as a poet who still awaits discovery?

10:20.457 --> 10:32.029
He's almost, in some sort of curious ways, in the same situation that Ezra Pound was toward the end of his life, or particularly during the time that he was in St.

10:32.089 --> 10:32.470
Elizabeth's.

10:34.332 --> 10:48.507
He had intimidatingly devoted, you know, people, people who almost made one fearful of attempting to read Pound because of the

10:49.735 --> 10:54.502
you know, the very terrific profundity and accomplishment of his work.

10:55.003 --> 11:07.322
I mean, really, one wondered if one were good enough to read down, and because of the complications of his political and social life, it was not an inviting prospect.

11:07.342 --> 11:10.367
And also the questions of his stability.

11:10.387 --> 11:12.250
Right, so I would get these notes.

11:12.270 --> 11:17.498
I remember writing to him as a young respecter of his

11:17.933 --> 11:34.636
And I thought, well, you know, I wanted to say that I respect and am devoted, I like your work.

11:34.776 --> 11:38.321
I didn't want to have it convinced, or I didn't want to have some sidekick.

11:38.341 --> 11:45.190
You know, I didn't want to be confronted with my own age group saying, you know, we don't think you're good enough or right enough to read this stuff.

11:45.524 --> 12:01.708
So Charles had unwittingly, sadly but truly dead, he didn't do it, but there began to be increasingly a cadre that were protecting him, as they felt.

12:01.768 --> 12:05.294
They were protecting what they felt was the true meaning.

12:06.395 --> 12:10.722
And many of them were friends, so it was a very complicated situation for me personally.

12:10.782 --> 12:13.506
I didn't want to

12:14.802 --> 12:20.928
I didn't want to denigrate or contest their own love for this terrific poet.

12:20.948 --> 12:32.178
But at the same time, I didn't want to see the whole thing become such a private club that no one would be, you know, you wouldn't want to be part of the gang.

12:33.098 --> 12:34.420
Women particularly, for instance.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.362
Now you'll be reading from his work, is that correct?

12:37.963 --> 12:38.223
Yeah.

12:38.343 --> 12:44.809
I'll be reading from poems, particularly to Worcester, obviously, and a little bit of the prose.

12:44.857 --> 13:00.790
where he talks of his father, especially the whole situation with his work as a mail carrier, a letter to the classic postman, and the way his attempts to support the unionizing mail carriers

13:01.630 --> 13:05.516
backfires and he finds himself really leaned on by the administration.

13:05.857 --> 13:08.942
It's rather extraordinary, don't you think, that Worcester is home?

13:08.962 --> 13:12.668
And I'm not a Worcester president from someplace else, Lowell.

13:13.168 --> 13:16.093
That's a great place.

13:16.113 --> 13:18.677
Another great city, right?

13:18.657 --> 13:22.481
But when you think of Olsen and Kunitz and Bishop.

13:23.582 --> 13:23.862
Yeah.

13:23.943 --> 13:25.444
I was thinking of Bob Cousy.

13:25.464 --> 13:25.844
Bob Cousy.

13:29.028 --> 13:30.449
I was deaf when I was coming out of New York.

13:30.469 --> 13:31.350
He's from New York, isn't he?

13:31.410 --> 13:34.313
Yeah, but he lives here in New York, apparently.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.455
In terms of a Whistler native.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.056
No, he's not a local boy.

13:37.076 --> 13:45.525
I know when Robert Giroux was doing the collective prose of Bishop, I had interviewed him over a couple years ago, and he wrote me.

13:46.265 --> 13:52.711
And he said, the facts of her life, her childhood and wisdom, are a mystery.

13:52.731 --> 13:58.797
And I went, well, I did about two days' worth of research, and I covered it to the point that he thanked me in the book.

13:58.918 --> 14:00.839
That's very useful, yeah.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.184
But he said there has to be something in this.

14:06.165 --> 14:14.533
Don't you think it's an old-time, it secures two kinds of people, either classic people who need a job, working class, in the various factories and mills?

14:14.817 --> 14:17.841
And or the people who own them.

14:17.901 --> 14:22.086
But in terms of poetry, I mean, really, what is it?

14:22.106 --> 14:22.667
It's free.

14:23.829 --> 14:26.873
It's cheap.

14:27.593 --> 14:39.188
But anyway, to get back to what I guess was driving, or briefly in a way, when you read from your own poetry, do you ever feel, I mean, do you ever revise as you go along?

14:39.689 --> 14:41.972
Not usually, but occasionally.

14:42.256 --> 14:48.964
The only dilemma, or the primary dilemma in reading one's own poetry is it gets stale.

14:49.004 --> 14:59.297
So telling a story or a joke or something, there's a time when the repetition of it, simply one knows it too well, it either becomes a study like a theatre piece.

15:00.379 --> 15:04.003
And that doesn't, for my interest, really work as poetry.

15:05.926 --> 15:11.132
I can read with my own interests, clearly enough.

15:11.382 --> 15:15.666
But I'm really not interested in reciting the poem in the standard way.

15:16.447 --> 15:28.560
So if it doesn't stay fresh to me, you know, frankly, getting here by plane, etc., etc., in the car, I mean, if there's not something to do this evening, I'm going to be very damn bored, you know, and go to sleep.

15:29.340 --> 15:37.349
So what I try to do is to think of what is fresh in this material, what stays interesting.

15:37.489 --> 15:39.651
That's what I reap for in all.

15:39.783 --> 15:45.128
So how do you feel reading somebody else's work?

15:45.589 --> 15:46.429
I've read it a lot.

15:46.449 --> 15:52.515
I remember Duncan, Robert Duncan is a very particular friend of both Charles's of mine.

15:52.535 --> 15:56.179
And he made a beautiful statement once, he said, I can't remember if I wrote it or I read it.

15:58.301 --> 15:58.681
That's great.

15:58.781 --> 15:59.802
And you know, that's it.

15:59.842 --> 16:03.566
At times there's work of Charles's that feels so intimate.

16:03.586 --> 16:08.170
Well that's funny because in this collection of essays you mention, you thank somebody

16:13.313 --> 16:19.303
It works in the other way, too.

16:19.323 --> 16:24.491
Well, there are things, for example, Charles's rhythms.

16:24.511 --> 16:32.925
You've got to think of Bob Cousy, because reading that particular way he would pass, or break, or fast break, or whatever, the way he changed basketball.

16:34.788 --> 16:40.637
There are moves in Charles's writing, which are not intellectual, but are just physical moves.

16:41.258 --> 16:47.124
He left him naked, the man said, and nakedness is what one means.

16:47.625 --> 16:54.972
That, he left him naked, the man said, that kind of rhythm, and nakedness is what one means, et cetera, et cetera.

16:55.353 --> 17:02.140
That is such a beautiful, quick shift of rhythm, almost like a drummer's rhythm.

17:02.160 --> 17:09.207
And it gets the thing to be said so quickly and clearly in your head, and it gets to you so quickly.

17:09.473 --> 17:12.517
He left them naked from that side.

17:12.537 --> 17:15.480
I guess that was the most impossible question.

17:15.500 --> 17:20.326
Did everyone ask anything to create a writer?

17:21.107 --> 17:24.652
Where did the stuff come from, of course?

17:25.393 --> 17:27.135
I don't really know.

17:27.155 --> 17:32.822
That's sort of the curious, like the ability to whistle or something, or carry a tune.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.426
It seems to be some innate

17:37.807 --> 17:42.633
I mean, did Shakespeare really think in imagery?

17:42.733 --> 17:43.574
I don't believe it.

17:43.734 --> 17:55.708
I mean, one thing that I really do believe is that people, and again, it's Charles' great quotation for him, was, we do what we know before we know what we do.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.450
That's great.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.792
That seems to make absolute sense.

18:00.473 --> 18:04.017
And I couldn't believe, for example, whether in sports or writing, that people were

18:04.250 --> 18:05.994
We're thinking it all out ahead of hand.

18:06.014 --> 18:07.257
I mean, a lot of them, we practice.

18:07.297 --> 18:08.801
I mean, obviously.

18:08.961 --> 18:10.445
Michael Jordan, I'm sure he's not rationalized.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.855
He's not saying, now I will lift and take the ball and put it in the basket.

18:15.076 --> 18:17.141
Extraordinary aerobatic.

18:17.161 --> 18:17.441
I know.

18:17.882 --> 18:20.689
Obviously he's rehearsed it a lot.

18:21.378 --> 18:38.855
In your own case, in one instance, when does one realize, I have a gift here, or an ability, or a talent, or an insight, and I'm a poet, or a poet is my calling?

18:38.875 --> 18:51.267
Well, I think on the other hand, again reading this quote, he obviously loves it.

18:51.736 --> 18:53.418
No, he's making a very simple point.

18:53.598 --> 18:55.941
Basketball was very good to me.

18:56.001 --> 18:59.846
Not just it paid me a lot of money, but I really liked playing it.

18:59.866 --> 19:09.558
And his point is simply that it gave him not only a use of himself, but it paid him well, et cetera, et cetera, but he was always interested in playing it.

19:09.578 --> 19:17.568
And I think with so-called poetry, with poetry literally, it really stays interesting to me as something I can do.

19:19.130 --> 19:21.473
Again, because Cousy was saying I still like it.

19:21.841 --> 19:25.467
I can't physically make it, perhaps, but I can still play.

19:25.487 --> 19:29.093
If you read the New York Times today, Michael Jordan showed up at the floor practice.

19:29.234 --> 19:29.995
I saw that.

19:30.015 --> 19:32.299
And they were trying to read the tea leaves here.

19:32.319 --> 19:33.681
What does this mean?

19:33.701 --> 19:45.722
Kuzi was saying that's going to be very hard for him to stay out, and talked about the, oh gosh, you know, oh hell, the great Celtics.

19:45.972 --> 19:46.513
Larry Bird.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.153
Larry Bird.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.137
His first season that was really hard.

19:50.157 --> 19:51.578
Because he had physical problems.

19:51.699 --> 19:53.320
He had really mandated it.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.423
He had to quit.

19:55.443 --> 20:09.499
But there's nothing about quitting at the absolute top of your form, like Jimmy Brown or Ted Williams or .

20:09.597 --> 20:12.640
And we all saw Willie Mays play.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.241
Yeah.

20:13.361 --> 20:15.383
I think it was a kid growing up.

20:15.903 --> 20:18.866
Joe Lewis was the hired.

20:19.407 --> 20:20.588
Yeah.

20:20.808 --> 20:22.310
It's just heartbreaking.

20:22.330 --> 20:23.551
Yeah.

20:23.571 --> 20:24.752
It's very, very sad.

20:25.353 --> 20:37.265
Well, where the sense if you could quit while you're ahead is that, but if you don't do anything else, if you don't have anything else that really interests you.

20:37.745 --> 20:39.587
Do you think that applies to writers at all?

20:40.107 --> 20:42.270
Yeah, I think it does.

20:42.471 --> 20:51.945
I think the curious time is when one gets old or is old.

20:52.966 --> 20:58.234
There can be an affection or respect that one has literally earned in what one's done.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.759
I mean, does a writer lose a couple of inches off his fastball?

21:01.779 --> 21:02.660
Oh yeah, sure.

21:04.703 --> 21:07.768
In the sense that what gives him or her

21:08.508 --> 21:14.494
of emotional prompting or a push, that changes significantly.

21:15.435 --> 21:25.045
Also, the surprise is inherent in this, you know, saying, moving this way or that way in a narrative or a rhythm or whatever.

21:25.065 --> 21:37.418
Again, one isn't, it isn't the same, not exactly, it stays wondrous or wonderful, but it doesn't, it's not the surprise quite as it happens.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.875
I mean, it still works.

21:39.955 --> 21:40.796
That's the pleasure.

21:41.157 --> 21:42.798
It's satisfaction, so to speak.

21:43.439 --> 21:49.305
But also the dilemma is that one becomes, in some old-fashioned way, too capable.

21:50.987 --> 21:57.194
And also one sees the... I was thinking of the election results in New York and whatnot.

21:57.374 --> 22:05.903
I mean, isn't there right or wrong, but you recognize the reaction to the fears of increased costs of living, etc., etc.

22:06.220 --> 22:12.067
It's a very human and old-time reaction, whether, I mean, I regretted it, so to speak.

22:12.087 --> 22:15.591
I wish Florian or whoever, Dinkins, whatever, had stayed.

22:16.171 --> 22:24.881
But here, I can understand, as they say, why people didn't feel that way, especially those who, you know, think, when's it going to stop?

22:25.062 --> 22:26.743
Well, in Jersey, I don't understand.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.085
That's funny, isn't it?

22:28.345 --> 22:29.467
Yeah, it seems so to me.

22:29.487 --> 22:30.828
New York, I can see.

22:30.848 --> 22:34.452
Yeah, that was just so close to the other times.

22:34.472 --> 22:35.113
Yeah, they're both.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.957
They're all pros in that.

22:38.278 --> 22:38.598
Crazy.

22:41.263 --> 22:43.767
But a little bit of your biography.

22:43.787 --> 22:44.708
You mentioned acting.

22:45.910 --> 22:50.978
Well my father had been a, during his life was primarily a doctor.

22:50.999 --> 22:56.748
He grew up in Belmont and his father had been a farmer actually.

22:56.768 --> 23:01.135
And then he must have had him sold the farm at one point.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.927
to all the real estate that was growing up with slides at Belmont Hill.

23:07.007 --> 23:11.273
So that left him in a comfortable space.

23:11.293 --> 23:14.398
He was briefly in the state legislature.

23:14.418 --> 23:18.784
And then anyhow, that's where my father was the only surviving child.

23:18.844 --> 23:22.550
He had a sister who died in adolescence.

23:22.570 --> 23:29.400
But in any case, he then went to Tufts and he went to Harvard Medical School.

23:30.241 --> 23:36.629
and then practiced in the Boston area for all of his life, actually.

23:36.870 --> 23:50.167
When I was born and out of Simms Hospital, where he was the resident physician, head of staff for a while, and then we lived at that time in Watertown, on Aubin Street.

23:51.189 --> 23:56.856
And then he got this idea, which was probably coming in in those days, in the late 20s,

23:57.528 --> 24:00.812
of getting the family out of the edges of the city.

24:00.852 --> 24:05.659
I don't think it was a sense of a grand estate, but he wanted the country, you know.

24:06.600 --> 24:13.088
So he got this old farmhouse out in Acton, West Acton, and that's where we were living when he died.

24:13.188 --> 24:14.550
He died about a year later.

24:15.171 --> 24:17.814
Is Fort Devens out there at that time?

24:18.295 --> 24:18.575
Yeah, yeah.

24:18.735 --> 24:23.822
My mother used to take her modest paycheck up to air, you know, in the bank.

24:24.646 --> 24:32.193
Now my peripheries as a kid were Maynard, for example, I think of Hudson.

24:32.273 --> 24:35.356
My Aunt Elvera came from Marlboro.

24:35.397 --> 24:37.939
My Aunt Bernice lived in Laconia.

24:37.999 --> 24:42.423
Lowell, for example, used to go on the way up to Laconia.

24:42.964 --> 24:46.047
So that was Chelmsford.

24:46.167 --> 24:54.315
Yeah, the old town of Boston, occasionally Waltham, that kind of thing.

24:54.515 --> 25:15.804
So when he died, my mother, who'd been a nurse, and went back to nursing, and she was first a nurse in Stowe, for example, and then when the job in Acton became open, she happily got that, was the nurse in the Acton street all the time I was growing up.

25:15.824 --> 25:22.513
But I'm really a single parent.

25:23.303 --> 25:35.337
I got a job here, and I had it, but then the University of Buffalo, where I worked, came through without my intent, came through with another offer that was just too good to say no to.

25:35.357 --> 25:36.778
The job where you were working?

25:36.798 --> 25:39.301
Here at Worcester Polytechnic.

25:39.541 --> 25:40.082
I thought so.

25:40.182 --> 25:42.605
I was very drawn to it.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.947
You've been there for some time, though, in Buffalo.

25:44.967 --> 25:46.629
Yeah, I've been there for 1966.

25:46.649 --> 25:50.053
I think that's...

25:50.455 --> 25:58.064
That was part of the, when I really was coming here, and we really all had signed the final papers.

25:58.084 --> 25:58.805
This was in 88.

25:58.925 --> 26:02.629
Anyhow, it did in Worcester.

26:02.669 --> 26:05.132
My wife had seen it, you know.

26:05.332 --> 26:07.795
I thought it would be lovely to get closer to home.

26:07.975 --> 26:11.720
It was a very attractive job.

26:11.740 --> 26:15.484
Was it possible for a poet to survive as a poet?

26:15.937 --> 26:20.383
Yeah, I think Bob Bly does very well.

26:21.524 --> 26:25.429
Denise Levertop has primarily done so, Allen Ginsberg.

26:25.589 --> 26:34.280
Both Denise and Allen have taught, but Allen now teaches regularly at Brooklyn College.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.824
And Denise has just retired actually from teaching.

26:38.926 --> 26:42.250
She had been teaching at Stanford.

26:42.270 --> 26:45.454
But in her case she was teaching in a writing program.

26:46.160 --> 26:50.006
Now, is this the gentleman?

26:50.907 --> 26:52.149
Hi, Bob Craley, hi.

26:52.369 --> 26:53.331
Hi, I'm Ken Cliff.

26:53.471 --> 26:55.134
Hi, Ken Gibson.

26:56.135 --> 26:58.819
Hi, how are you doing?

26:59.340 --> 27:01.884
Nice to meet you.

27:02.284 --> 27:04.067
We're doing a little interview.

27:04.385 --> 27:06.207
Are you ready to run right now?

27:06.267 --> 27:07.469
You're my host.

27:07.850 --> 27:08.591
Yes.

27:08.631 --> 27:11.174
You may take your time.

27:11.294 --> 27:12.035
If you don't mind.

27:12.436 --> 27:14.218
Not at all.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.281
What was your schedule?

27:16.401 --> 27:18.644
What time do you want to dinner?

27:18.664 --> 27:21.548
We're supposed to be a restaurant.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.690
Oh, you are.

27:24.231 --> 27:27.035
We better wind down.

27:27.315 --> 27:28.657
I can get you.

27:29.098 --> 27:30.219
Can I quiet you sometime?

27:30.519 --> 27:31.000
Yeah.
