WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:07.346
Okay.

00:09.068 --> 00:11.512
I don't know if you had seen this.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.374
I'll gladly give you a copy.

00:13.414 --> 00:13.795
I love one.

00:14.136 --> 00:16.339
I do this completely myself.

00:17.500 --> 00:29.037
I mean, I do the scanning, the layout, of course, the writing, and then I printed myself on a color copier.

00:29.438 --> 00:30.019
You do that?

00:30.119 --> 00:31.000
Yes, uh-huh.

00:31.368 --> 00:35.055
And the only thing I don't do in-house is the binding, really.

00:35.095 --> 00:41.787
So this allows me to do very small runs of catalogs.

00:41.807 --> 00:46.616
I can economically print 100 copies or 200 copies.

00:47.578 --> 00:52.026
And so you have a completely new facility of doing catalogs.

00:52.242 --> 01:13.409
Also books, I mean, it would be the same thing, and also, I mean, I don't know if this will be a general way of doing it, but of course it changes completely, even some things which we are very fond of, like issue points or things like that, because you're changing constantly.

01:13.509 --> 01:21.480
I mean, you know, if I sell a book, I can take it out, I can look in a new one, or I find an error, I correct it.

01:21.500 --> 01:21.760
That's right.

01:22.246 --> 01:27.875
But of course, once it's printed, then there would be issue points and things like that.

01:27.895 --> 01:41.275
Yes, but I mean, there would be so many that it's no longer an issue, I think, because at any point, I mean, after 10 copies you can change, or I mean, it becomes very fragmented.

01:41.296 --> 01:50.650
It's almost the way books were printed when they were invented, because they were constantly making corrections as they look at the Gutenberg Bible, any number of different

01:51.305 --> 01:55.671
Or even the Shakespeare folios are constantly changing points for points.

01:55.731 --> 01:56.472
Exactly.

01:56.492 --> 02:00.117
Because they would make discoveries as they went along, and they would correct them.

02:00.137 --> 02:02.661
But that's beautiful color separation, I have to say.

02:02.901 --> 02:04.023
You do that here?

02:04.363 --> 02:04.964
Yes.

02:05.305 --> 02:06.066
That's amazing.

02:07.388 --> 02:08.029
That's wonderful.

02:09.931 --> 02:18.223
What I'm really kind of interested in are a number of things, but I'm interested in writing a chapter that...

02:19.233 --> 02:21.856
give some sense of the scholar bookseller.

02:22.917 --> 02:28.883
A bookseller like yourself, you just start with this catalog right here.

02:28.903 --> 02:31.505
You do all this work, all the research, all of the writing.

02:32.266 --> 02:37.611
And if we could just have a general discussion, first of all, I understand you started mainly as a collector, is that right?

02:38.472 --> 02:41.235
Yes, that's correct, yes.

02:41.755 --> 02:48.582
And could you just, you're a lawyer, I believe, by training, is that right?

02:49.000 --> 02:53.307
Actually, I'm now into my third life, so to speak.

02:59.797 --> 03:10.573
The family I come from had an industrial company, electroplating company, which my father had founded and brought to considerable success.

03:11.535 --> 03:14.940
And when I went to university,

03:15.443 --> 03:20.170
didn't really think or feel that I would want to go into the company.

03:20.791 --> 03:32.249
Fortunately, I had very little inclination towards chemistry or physics or any science which would have been useful in that field.

03:32.931 --> 03:40.202
So on the other hand, the field I was most attracted to would have been

03:40.688 --> 04:03.102
the study of the English language but I felt too practical to do this because the venues opening up with that field of study to me seemed very limited so I decided to go into law.

04:03.470 --> 04:29.578
you know at the time I thought well if you study English you can only become a teacher and I mean teacher I felt wasn't a very attractive choice although now I have to say that I only found this out when I had a son of course teachers in Switzerland are among the most highly paid highly

04:31.381 --> 04:54.958
regarded people with enormous amounts of holidays and whatever so the best old age pensions that you can think of so from that point of view it wouldn't have been such a bad choice but still I'm sure that this wouldn't have been the right thing for me to do so as I said I went into law and

04:55.613 --> 04:59.276
I graduated and I went to... Where was this?

04:59.356 --> 05:00.037
Where did you study?

05:00.057 --> 05:00.718
In Zurich, yes.

05:01.278 --> 05:01.979
At the university?

05:02.219 --> 05:02.639
Yes.

05:03.280 --> 05:15.471
Well, you know, in law, you're somewhat limited in choice because after all, you have your local law, so that didn't afford me the possibility to study elsewhere.

05:15.811 --> 05:21.396
You mentioned, let me just interrupt for a second, you said that you were interested in the study of the English language.

05:21.536 --> 05:23.578
In what respect, as a...

05:24.250 --> 05:27.174
As literature, or the language itself?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.838
As literature, yes, as literature.

05:29.858 --> 05:30.459
I think so.

05:30.479 --> 05:32.001
I think your fact is finished.

05:32.021 --> 05:35.546
It must have been a long... It was the whole article, I think.

05:39.772 --> 05:40.994
All right, we're back on it again.

05:41.234 --> 05:46.782
So you were talking about... So you did go and study the law?

05:47.403 --> 05:53.432
And then I went to court, which is a prerequisite for becoming a lawyer here.

05:53.552 --> 05:55.315
I suppose it's the same in America.

05:56.557 --> 06:09.997
And of course, when I saw the field of law, I saw that, I mean, the battle amongst lawyers is quite heavy.

06:10.037 --> 06:15.705
So eventually, when the time came, I decided to go into the family business after all.

06:16.073 --> 06:44.815
and so i did run this for for a good 20 years i think what was it what's the name of the business uh it's flumen yes and uh in the good times it was it was a very attractive business because we were uh technologically positioned very high and i had lots of opportunities to go to the states and other places um but

06:45.740 --> 06:55.715
Then it became more difficult and four years ago I had the chance to sell it and get out and start in this.

06:56.255 --> 06:58.899
So you've only been in this for four years then?

06:58.919 --> 07:05.790
Well, on my own, fortunately, I don't know, most people know it.

07:06.751 --> 07:08.233
Yeah, I think I know what you're going to do.

07:08.253 --> 07:08.473
Go ahead.

07:08.494 --> 07:14.262
Yes, you know, ten years ago I associated with Tenshirt.

07:14.967 --> 07:43.557
on this company where you will go and see him when we did this for him it was a second company in Switzerland and for me it was a sideline it was more of a hobby I mean to have a share part in his business it came about through various coincidences but I was

07:44.110 --> 08:07.772
disposed to do this at the time that he needed a Swiss partner because otherwise he couldn't have set it up and that we had grown to know each other and become friends so that was a good occasion to do this but at the point where I realized that I would now want to do this as a living

08:08.275 --> 08:19.991
It was also very clear to me that I would have to do it on my own because I have never worked under someone in my life and I wasn't going to start now.

08:20.711 --> 08:24.056
Especially when you're picking a career that is strictly because you love it.

08:24.276 --> 08:24.597
Yes.

08:25.738 --> 08:32.427
I mean, if you're going to pick a career to be a very profitable one, this is not...

08:32.997 --> 08:35.139
the one people would normally start in.

08:35.199 --> 08:38.483
You usually pick books because you love the books, would be my guess.

08:40.085 --> 08:57.604
So, I mean, actually, I think this has influenced both my position and his situation, because at the point where I got out of the company, he decided to move the center of his operation to Switzerland, and

08:58.090 --> 09:07.601
Also through the years we had done this, the attitude of the authorities towards him had changed.

09:08.722 --> 09:19.834
I suppose he'll tell you about this, but Schofhausen is a small canton and he resides in one of the foremost residences they have out there.

09:19.854 --> 09:27.523
So at the beginning they were very suspicious and eventually they started to accept him so he could move this and now he has his

09:28.145 --> 09:29.747
main seat of business there.

09:29.988 --> 09:39.982
I don't really want to talk about him, but did you know him from buying books from him?

09:40.002 --> 09:41.545
That's right.

09:41.765 --> 09:43.427
That's interesting to me.

09:43.668 --> 09:46.011
You must have been collecting at that time.

09:46.993 --> 09:47.534
Indeed, yes.

09:47.714 --> 09:53.983
I had started, I'm sure, a good ten years before he started to deal.

09:54.487 --> 10:23.312
and actually this is a story where we always have a good laugh about it because when i got his first catalog i thought there must be something wrong here because somebody out in deepest bavaria is not ever gonna have that kind of book must be either terrible copies or something wrong with him and i think it took him several

10:23.545 --> 10:28.830
catalogs to convince me at least to travel out there and have a look at things.

10:29.751 --> 10:33.074
And that's when our relationship started.

10:33.194 --> 10:46.888
And I very early on realized that there was an extraordinary personality in the book business there who was going to become big.

10:47.048 --> 10:51.392
I was always convinced of that.

10:51.997 --> 10:53.499
How long has he been in business?

10:57.484 --> 11:00.607
About 20 years now, I see.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.333
What kinds of books were you collecting at the time?

11:05.353 --> 11:13.363
Well, I started collecting with French Illustrated Romantics in the 19th century.

11:18.727 --> 11:26.737
And what was there, you said when you saw his first catalogs, you were skeptical that he could have the quality that he was suggesting.

11:27.878 --> 11:29.320
Yes, or that I was looking for.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.461
That you were looking for.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.162
Yes.

11:33.064 --> 11:36.108
So tell me a little bit about the kinds of books that you first layered.

11:36.609 --> 11:40.313
Clearly then, a book for you I think has to be

11:40.968 --> 11:43.572
It's darn near perfect for you to... That's right, yes.

11:43.592 --> 11:46.016
That condition is exceedingly important to you.

11:46.036 --> 11:46.577
Uh-huh, that's right.

11:46.597 --> 11:47.478
Is that right?

11:47.519 --> 11:48.300
You gathered that.

11:50.804 --> 11:52.827
These are the books of your collection here?

11:53.208 --> 11:56.493
No, these are the books that are for sale.

11:56.934 --> 11:57.254
I see.

11:57.615 --> 12:01.040
Do you still collect, or have your books gone into stock now?

12:03.745 --> 12:08.292
I made a very clear decision about this, because...

12:08.677 --> 12:25.643
We all know about the French book dealers who put some books in the back and sell the others and I think that basically you have to give your client the best choice.

12:25.723 --> 12:35.578
So I did keep my personal field of collecting which are the 19th century French romantics.

12:37.668 --> 12:44.517
I put everything else in the company, and everything I buy goes into stock.

12:45.559 --> 12:54.471
Was that a hard decision for you to make, to take books that you had acquired for yourself and that you loved, apparently?

12:54.651 --> 12:59.057
To my own surprise, it wasn't hard at all, actually.

12:59.297 --> 13:02.241
With very few exceptions, maybe.

13:02.828 --> 13:32.700
Sometimes, but not very often, I feel a certain pain when a book goes, because also the way I choose books, usually when one copy goes, I know that I'm not very likely to see another one like that in my life, and I've become very much aware of this, especially recently when I find that

13:33.524 --> 13:40.431
It's quite tough to find enough stock at a certain level.

13:42.233 --> 13:53.665
Can you think of a few books offhand that, in particular, that really you looked at and said, well, this may be the last time I handled a book like this.

13:53.946 --> 13:54.847
Anything come to mind?

13:56.288 --> 14:01.894
I think I would have to look at my...

14:02.583 --> 14:18.607
sales list stuff, and anyhow, I have to say, the major difference between Tangent and me, apart from anything else, is that he has a fabulous memory, and my memory is rather bad.

14:19.108 --> 14:23.174
I'm lost without my computer.

14:25.037 --> 14:31.847
But to expand on this, actually, I found it very satisfying to be able to

14:32.215 --> 15:00.737
raise the enthusiasm of someone else about the book I like, I mean, to see that you share this with someone, to see that someone else is also willing to part with a considerable amount of money, I find that very satisfying on the one hand, and then also it's always a prerequisite because usually you have something else in mind which you can only buy if you sell this, so

15:02.287 --> 15:10.196
I think maybe after 20 years also you find out that you do not have to possess everything.

15:10.256 --> 15:14.701
I mean, it is satisfying enough to have owned it at one point.

15:14.841 --> 15:16.603
That it's passed through your head?

15:16.623 --> 15:17.865
Yes.

15:18.625 --> 15:22.850
And the kinds of books you sell are still different from the books that you collect, right?

15:23.491 --> 15:23.791
Yes.

15:24.052 --> 15:28.817
So the books that you sell, you focus in what areas then?

15:29.573 --> 15:32.817
also illustrated books.

15:33.938 --> 15:48.836
I have to say that when I started out with the company, I had the intention of having a focus which went from the illustrated book of the 15th to the 20th century.

15:48.856 --> 15:58.888
In the meantime, I've had to realize that it has become so hard in Cunabula, for instance, to get any

16:00.202 --> 16:06.550
stock which makes it worse for a client to come by or I don't know what.

16:06.570 --> 16:12.237
But I have left the older books left out the way.

16:12.277 --> 16:28.977
Sixteenths and seventeenths is maybe not so attractive anyhow, very limited so that today I would say that my field is eighteenth to twentieth century illustrated books by which I mainly understand illustrated literature or

16:29.699 --> 16:37.270
And then, to a certain extent, literature and bindings, which I like.

16:37.611 --> 16:43.259
What are the qualities that you think are essential to be a successful bookseller?

16:43.739 --> 16:52.332
What do you need in addition to being a collector?

16:53.408 --> 17:08.492
That's an interesting question, and I'm not sure if it really has an answer, because sometimes when I look at my colleagues or I look at myself, there are so many different characters.

17:08.952 --> 17:19.669
I mean, there are shy people, there are aggressive people, there are people which I find rather unattractive, so to speak.

17:20.020 --> 17:27.768
but everyone has his clientele in a way, so... I'm sorry.

17:31.732 --> 17:47.107
So... Frankly, qualities of a bookseller, I think, as far as I'm concerned, I just try to be myself, really.

17:47.807 --> 17:49.369
I try to...

17:50.952 --> 18:02.163
to listen to people, to transmit a certain enthusiasm.

18:04.425 --> 18:17.297
Let's talk a little bit about how you became, again you told me a little bit about your background, and before going to university you thought you'd like to be a teacher, that would be my guess.

18:17.767 --> 18:23.454
I just thought that if I would choose my favorite field of study... It would be literature.

18:24.074 --> 18:31.863
It would be literature, and that would only leave me the choice of teaching and... Or writing or whatever.

18:32.104 --> 18:34.266
Or writing, yes.

18:36.108 --> 18:40.373
Were you always... Did you love books from the time you were a boy?

18:40.774 --> 18:42.636
Almost, yes.

18:42.656 --> 18:43.757
Were you always a collector?

18:44.362 --> 18:47.406
I'm not like Justin Schiller.

18:47.467 --> 18:50.571
I didn't start collecting that early, actually.

18:50.651 --> 18:57.842
I just read a great deal up to, I mean, from quite a nerdy age.

18:58.623 --> 19:05.813
So I was just generally very fond of books, and at the same time I was always quite fond of art.

19:06.955 --> 19:11.702
And I think at one point I had this...

19:13.015 --> 19:16.199
a thing which we called in German, A-ha.

19:16.279 --> 19:18.702
How do you spell that?

19:19.182 --> 19:19.563
A-ha.

19:19.743 --> 19:20.904
Oh, A-ha, okay.

19:20.984 --> 19:24.488
That's easy enough.

19:24.508 --> 19:34.500
Which was the point when I suddenly realized that...

19:35.054 --> 19:36.536
will help me here.

19:36.556 --> 19:36.816
Go ahead.

19:37.077 --> 19:51.695
Okay, so when I had this aha leaveness, I realized that illustrated books were the perfect combination of my two loves, literature and art.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.324
This is now when you're deciding to be a bookseller?

19:58.824 --> 20:00.166
No, to be a collector.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.849
I see, okay.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.390
And...

20:04.180 --> 20:05.582
How would you describe your collection?

20:07.023 --> 20:08.866
Excellent, one of the best?

20:08.906 --> 20:14.713
Did it matter to you that you had to have... Were you competitive, I guess, is what I'm talking about?

20:14.733 --> 20:16.695
Would you consider yourself a competitive collector?

20:18.477 --> 20:24.825
Well, probably everyone is to a certain extent, but it was even somewhat different.

20:26.107 --> 20:32.955
When I started collecting, I was just like, I was 30, almost 30 years old.

20:33.526 --> 20:44.882
And like most people, I think, I made the mistake which you can make in books where you think you can get a cheap copy.

20:45.203 --> 20:48.908
You're clever, you buy cheaper than the other person.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.432
And so I collected also.

20:51.452 --> 20:53.194
I mean, I didn't have the means at the time.

20:53.275 --> 21:02.588
I collected books for a few hundred dollars to maybe $2,000 for about three years, I think.

21:03.125 --> 21:23.957
Then I came across some better copies and I wanted to have the better copy and I wanted to sell the lesser copy which was greeted with a great deal of disinterest by the dealer or dealers at the time which I thought was rather humiliating.

21:25.259 --> 21:30.988
So that was really the major influence when I said

21:31.762 --> 21:40.510
From now on, I'm only going to buy books of a quality where the dealer will get down on his knees and beg if I want to sell.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.893
That's a wonderful quote.

21:42.933 --> 21:43.873
I love that, yeah.

21:43.893 --> 21:49.419
Of course, they never do that, but... They never do that, but they certainly demonstrate their enthusiasm.

21:49.739 --> 21:52.241
And they don't dick them over prices either, right?

21:52.982 --> 21:53.463
Exactly.

21:53.523 --> 22:01.330
So that was, I think, what was the major influence on my...

22:01.664 --> 22:13.174
aptitude in collecting, apart from the fact that I think, as a family, we have always been rather meticulous and perfectionist.

22:13.315 --> 22:14.976
This goes through my whole family.

22:15.897 --> 22:20.521
Strangely enough, there are many Virgos.

22:21.502 --> 22:26.907
I'm a Virgo, my wife is a Virgo, our friends are Virgos, Tenshirt is a Virgo.

22:26.947 --> 22:30.270
Despite the fact that I do

22:30.588 --> 22:32.270
put no stock whatsoever.

22:32.290 --> 22:32.671
I don't believe it.

22:32.691 --> 22:34.333
You put tremendous stock in it.

22:34.373 --> 22:39.941
Do Virgos tend to be very meticulous people?

22:40.141 --> 22:41.342
That's what they say, yes.

22:41.863 --> 22:42.684
How about Geminis?

22:44.106 --> 22:48.092
Well, probably, but I don't think they're scatterbrained like me.

22:48.372 --> 22:58.806
So in any case, whether I put stock in it or not, I do conform to the

23:00.490 --> 23:03.873
preconception one has of the work.

23:05.114 --> 23:15.323
So on a superficial level at least, you certainly see some consistency of the pattern.

23:16.524 --> 23:25.673
When you were collecting, did you have a list of things that you wanted, or did you mainly see things and decide that you wanted them?

23:27.074 --> 23:30.497
Did you have a scheme in your head as to what the collection should involve?

23:30.663 --> 23:32.105
Not so much, no.

23:32.586 --> 23:39.739
I mean, of course, like the French Romantics, you have a certain thing.

23:39.799 --> 23:44.707
For instance, I looked for copies on China papers.

23:48.093 --> 23:53.903
That gives you, in a sense, a certain list of books that you would like to have.

23:54.288 --> 23:56.911
Basically, I was very eclectic.

23:56.931 --> 24:00.855
I was very much governed with what I liked, with what I saw.

24:00.955 --> 24:07.722
I was really able to go for something completely different just because I liked it.

24:09.384 --> 24:21.257
Also, as I said, I started in the 19th century, then I went up to Art Nouveau, French books of the turn of the century, Bindings.

24:21.743 --> 24:47.245
Then I went back to the 18th century, then I went further back, and then I went again up towards more modern, like the 30s, Schmid, and people like that, to maybe not quite that much, although I have a few, but usually it stops around the 40s or 50s.

24:47.647 --> 24:53.576
When you were collecting, did you research the books that you purchased the way you now have to research them as a bookseller?

24:54.197 --> 24:56.300
Did you do kind of bibliographical inquiries?

24:57.642 --> 25:03.210
Did you expect the person you were buying the book from to do all that?

25:04.151 --> 25:15.628
Generally speaking, of course, you always derive a certain pleasure by doing some research on the book, but I'm

25:16.958 --> 25:28.112
I was more governed by, as they say, by the heart than by the intellect usually in my decisions.

25:28.132 --> 25:29.133
Beauty, in other words.

25:29.374 --> 25:29.534
Yes.

25:31.476 --> 25:34.801
But now as a bookseller, look, you show me this catalog where you do everything.

25:34.861 --> 25:40.868
There must be some satisfaction in that you totally produce these catalogs.

25:40.888 --> 25:41.870
Yes, of course.

25:43.712 --> 25:46.155
Is that a new kind of satisfaction for you?

25:46.507 --> 25:47.408
Yes, very much.

25:47.749 --> 25:49.832
I mean, an intellectual satisfaction.

25:49.852 --> 25:50.453
Indeed, yes.

25:52.356 --> 25:59.107
And do you feel that you probably know more about the books now as a bookseller than you ever possibly could have known as a collector?

25:59.127 --> 26:00.449
That's possible, too, isn't it?

26:00.469 --> 26:00.810
Oh, yes.

26:00.930 --> 26:08.883
I mean, it grows all the time, and at the same time, you realize that you know very little.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.367
It's, of course...

26:15.110 --> 26:17.893
I had a thought and I lost it.

26:17.913 --> 26:18.493
Forgive me.

26:19.154 --> 26:22.698
I think the jet lag is finally catching up to me.

26:23.959 --> 26:27.343
Where do you find books now to acquire for stock?

26:27.683 --> 26:28.684
That must be difficult.

26:29.625 --> 26:33.549
Before, I assume you worked mainly through booksellers.

26:33.929 --> 26:38.234
The books you bought for your collection, you acquired from booksellers.

26:38.254 --> 26:44.340
Now you have to evolve a whole different process, don't you?

26:45.687 --> 26:47.669
Well, without naming names, I'm just curious.

26:47.749 --> 26:49.051
No, no.

26:49.071 --> 26:58.583
Obviously, I'm not interested in doing anything, but in general, how do you now develop, and then also just how you develop a clientele?

26:58.763 --> 26:58.983
Yes.

26:59.223 --> 27:01.967
What do you do into the business at this level?

27:04.550 --> 27:05.531
Gradually, I think.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.636
I mean, the clientele.

27:11.354 --> 27:40.872
great deal of luck in starting and having some good friends in the business which helped me with the client base as they say in the States so I was able to do immediately some mailings to a considerable amount of people which gave me enough potential clients actually that allowed me to start and

27:41.915 --> 27:47.141
Now I see that over the years, this gradually evolves.

27:47.321 --> 27:52.226
I do fairs, which I think is one of the best ways of doing it.

27:52.286 --> 27:53.628
Very good to meet people.

27:53.648 --> 27:57.372
So I gradually develop my own clientele.

27:59.514 --> 28:05.801
This wasn't actually as difficult as I might have thought.

28:05.821 --> 28:11.567
Well, I think our friend Priscilla says, there's a movie about...

28:12.627 --> 28:15.149
Baseball, I forget the name of it.

28:15.429 --> 28:16.750
If you build it, they will come.

28:17.231 --> 28:18.512
Remember that?

28:18.532 --> 28:18.732
Yes.

28:18.752 --> 28:20.394
I know she likes that movie.

28:20.454 --> 28:22.095
Isn't it Bull Durham?

28:22.195 --> 28:23.957
No, it's Field of Dreams.

28:23.977 --> 28:24.897
Field of Dreams.

28:25.358 --> 28:25.818
Exactly.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.900
If you build it, they will come.

28:29.301 --> 28:34.506
And essentially, if you have the beautiful books, the clients will find you.

28:34.706 --> 28:35.086
Yes.

28:35.666 --> 28:38.289
Is that a fair statement?

28:38.309 --> 28:42.212
If you have the beautiful books... To a certain extent, I mean...

28:42.513 --> 28:50.301
My colleagues tell me that five years ago or ten years ago it was much easier.

28:51.883 --> 28:55.306
Now I have to say they don't just come.

28:55.427 --> 29:00.292
I mean, you really have to go out and get them.

29:00.512 --> 29:07.219
You can no longer afford to just... Put out your list.

29:07.399 --> 29:10.022
Yeah, waiting for the phone to ring.

29:10.728 --> 29:12.611
And how often do you do catalogs?

29:14.574 --> 29:16.376
Two to three a year.

29:17.598 --> 29:19.401
Although they vary.

29:19.461 --> 29:23.227
I mean, it can be like this.

29:23.407 --> 29:29.155
I mean, these were the first ones, which I did in the traditional manner, which was exceedingly expensive.

29:29.876 --> 29:32.961
Then maybe a smaller specialized catalog.

29:34.764 --> 29:39.030
What I really do now on these catalogs,

29:46.604 --> 29:51.611
works quite well, is that I do two editions.

29:52.633 --> 29:53.153
Oh, you do?

29:53.173 --> 30:01.285
This is sort of the deluxe edition, and this is the regular edition, which has just a few pictures and no color.

30:02.287 --> 30:03.008
Well, that's smart.

30:03.649 --> 30:16.527
I think so, because as you must realize, the number of people who buy at that level isn't that big, so

30:17.030 --> 30:31.123
What I do is that my clients get this catalog free and potential clients get it free and the other ones get this one and if they want to have this one they have to pay for it.

30:32.284 --> 30:35.687
So far it seems to have worked.

30:36.247 --> 30:47.037
Also I have to say that I find no recognizable pattern of buying between cheap and expensive catalogs.

30:47.337 --> 31:04.398
I couldn't say that I necessarily sell more books out of an expensive catalog than, for instance, sometimes I do, for the fairs, I do smaller lists, and sometimes they do just as well as the expensive catalog.

31:04.418 --> 31:06.641
It's what's in it, doesn't it?

31:06.661 --> 31:11.326
Of course, your reputation is to want to have beautiful books.

31:11.547 --> 31:13.429
Yes.

31:13.898 --> 31:18.325
Well, but of course, at this level, I think some people expect you to do it.

31:18.345 --> 31:18.666
Yes.

31:19.707 --> 31:20.749
It's the expectation.

31:20.949 --> 31:23.554
Exactly, yes.

31:23.614 --> 31:28.922
Attention apparently does catalogs that sell for like $100 and $150, isn't that right?

31:29.343 --> 31:40.581
Yes, I mean, well, but I mean, what he does, I mean, this is like, I couldn't even compare, I mean, like, I mean, he does

31:40.730 --> 31:45.135
photography, printing of the highest achievable quality.

31:45.155 --> 31:50.802
I know that he spent several hundred thousand dollars on a catalog.

31:51.102 --> 31:58.771
It's really almost unique in book selling, isn't it, what he does?

31:59.312 --> 32:07.682
As far as the luxury of the catalogs goes, there are two people who do something similar, which might be

32:08.067 --> 32:13.416
Gunther in Germany and Surgey in France.

32:20.527 --> 32:26.817
Where would you say most of the business is these days?

32:26.917 --> 32:28.259
European customers?

32:30.503 --> 32:33.568
For me, yes.

32:35.152 --> 32:40.861
Not in Switzerland, but in Europe are my clients.

32:43.865 --> 32:49.494
It's frustrating that I have not yet been able to build up a clientele in the States.

32:49.834 --> 32:50.175
Really?

32:50.916 --> 32:54.721
I may not have the good addresses, or I don't know what it is.

32:55.543 --> 33:04.416
But in any case, I've decided to go to the New York Book Fair in spring to see if I can get some clients there.

33:05.543 --> 33:11.812
clientele to speak of in England either, which I don't know what the problem is there.

33:12.513 --> 33:19.945
But generally speaking, the English book business seems to be in a state of change.

33:20.145 --> 33:25.232
Of course, but the books are wonderful.

33:26.394 --> 33:35.027
You would think that if there are collectors for these kinds of books, this is all stuck here, right?

33:35.328 --> 33:37.211
And you still have a personal collection?

33:37.591 --> 33:37.732
Mm-hmm.

33:37.752 --> 33:38.913
And that's not here, of course.

33:38.953 --> 33:39.534
No.

33:39.755 --> 33:43.520
No, that's good.

33:43.540 --> 33:58.883
What do you think, just in general, and this is not for quotation, but just what areas do you think would be really interesting for me to pursue with Mr. Tentrick from the standpoint of a writer?

33:59.764 --> 34:00.225
Mm-hmm.

34:00.245 --> 34:02.128
What is the most interesting story about

34:02.581 --> 34:03.503
his operation.

34:04.064 --> 34:08.551
What do you think readers would find particularly interesting about him?

34:11.136 --> 34:14.662
I'm just looking for some areas to shut down a little bit.

34:15.083 --> 34:20.051
Anyway, I'd love for you to show me some of your books.

34:21.374 --> 34:22.015
Can you do that?

34:22.155 --> 34:22.997
Yes, of course.

34:23.017 --> 34:24.720
I promise I won't have my pen out.

34:25.361 --> 34:26.142
I'll put it away.

34:26.257 --> 34:30.501
Am I dressed okay, by the way, if I go into ten shirts like this?

34:30.842 --> 34:34.045
I left my big valise at the hotel.

34:37.389 --> 34:38.069
Magnificence.

34:41.613 --> 34:44.816
Well, I mean, maybe first I'll begin with the layout.

34:45.237 --> 34:51.984
This is the corner where I had the old books, which has become very much reduced, as you can see.

34:52.604 --> 34:54.306
Of course, some of the

34:55.720 --> 34:58.584
The Mayapotum is also governed by their size.

34:58.604 --> 35:06.194
I have a Schädel, which by now I find completely boring because it's such a frequent book.

35:07.035 --> 35:21.475
Here I have German press books, mostly for early illustrated German books, continuing with older German illustrated books.

35:22.282 --> 35:32.952
going to look to the French illustrative books, 18th century, some Elseviers, which again... Which are the Elseviers?

35:32.972 --> 35:33.913
The little ones there.

35:34.994 --> 35:47.346
Yes, some of the little ones, which are again, maybe more, you know, maybe more governed by the whole than by necessarily by the content.

35:47.466 --> 35:48.127
That's gorgeous.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.449
And of course today I find, you know,

35:51.391 --> 35:55.957
is very much interested in these anymore.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.026
Look at the conditions.

36:03.227 --> 36:04.449
It's Courtland Bishop.

36:06.512 --> 36:09.376
Maybe I can pick out a few books.

36:09.496 --> 36:19.710
One project which I have at this point is a catalogue about Dance of Death, which, however, will only contain three pieces

36:20.146 --> 36:36.983
three important dances of death, starting with Holbein, and then I have an early manuscript of the dance of death, which was influenced by this Basel dance of death, which again was inspired by Holbein.

36:38.145 --> 36:40.127
You know the Basel dance of death?

36:40.227 --> 36:49.056
And then there was an interesting 18th century dance of death by Swiss artist Schellenberg, who was very

36:50.032 --> 36:55.019
a well-known artist in Switzerland, maybe not so much outside.

36:57.943 --> 37:09.198
It is widely known because it has a plate showing what is considered to be the first aerial accident.

37:09.959 --> 37:10.259
Really?

37:10.360 --> 37:11.601
Yes.

37:11.621 --> 37:17.389
As a matter of fact, I offered it to the Huntington for their ballooning collection, and they already had it.

37:18.112 --> 37:20.274
Oh, look at that.

37:20.334 --> 37:25.320
And what's the date on this?

37:25.340 --> 37:25.980
It's 1785.

37:26.481 --> 37:26.601
Wow.

37:27.902 --> 37:28.903
That's amazing.

37:29.364 --> 37:32.287
And I have all the original drawings for these illustrations.

37:33.508 --> 37:42.938
So this is going to make a very nice theme catalog, and I have a German university.

37:43.340 --> 37:47.745
who's a young woman who's specializing in the ends of death.

37:47.785 --> 37:50.869
We will write a comment on that.

37:52.170 --> 37:55.113
And this is off the end.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.837
She's only asking 2,000 notes.

37:57.857 --> 37:59.458
She's very good, actually.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.521
That's terrific.

38:02.322 --> 38:09.550
This is what is considered to be the largest known copy of the Holbein.

38:12.162 --> 38:13.344
Oh, that is gorgeous.

38:15.127 --> 38:15.768
Magnificent.

38:16.449 --> 38:24.000
And this is in a... This belonged to Payet, the famous French collector.

38:24.021 --> 38:26.124
How do we spell?

38:26.524 --> 38:29.329
P-A-I-L-L-E-T.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.190
Oh, okay, sure.

38:31.372 --> 38:38.283
And... This was by Marie-S-Michelle.

38:38.543 --> 38:39.064
Oh, wow.

38:39.635 --> 38:44.141
Some people love it, some hate it.

38:44.161 --> 38:46.864
Because, of course, it's macabre.

38:47.225 --> 38:55.715
Well, it's not only macabre, but it's inspired by the early bindings.

38:55.735 --> 39:00.722
It's, of course, reinterpretation.

39:00.742 --> 39:05.708
I see what you're saying, yeah.

39:05.728 --> 39:05.828
Yeah.

39:06.517 --> 39:10.320
Very fine boccaccio from the La Mignon Library.

39:12.542 --> 39:14.544
So provenance is very important, isn't it?

39:15.605 --> 39:15.725
Yes.

39:27.735 --> 39:30.538
Gulliver printed on vellum.

39:31.359 --> 39:32.439
On Gulliver in vellum?

39:33.681 --> 39:35.342
I mean the French one, of course.

39:36.942 --> 39:37.423
Beautiful.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.654
How long have most of these been in stock?

39:45.976 --> 40:00.038
Do you move a lot of the stock, or is it... The book would be best if you did... The book is, of course, formed by my collection and by what I have been able to buy in the past four years.

40:00.158 --> 40:02.241
So it's...

40:03.537 --> 40:08.204
Not everything has been in the catalog, so I'm still, you know, I'm still moving this.

40:08.324 --> 40:14.953
I don't constantly, fortunately, have to move my complete stock or whatever.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.897
So you're still enjoying them as a collector, in other words?

40:18.638 --> 40:19.239
In a way, yes.

40:19.339 --> 40:20.040
In a way, yeah.

40:21.863 --> 40:29.013
They are perfectly, you are perfectly organized in place.

40:29.073 --> 40:29.474
Beautiful.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.139
This is maybe the finest copy of the very...

40:34.013 --> 40:45.627
I thought of the Swiss book of the 18th century, the Zordel album, which is The Views of Switzerland, with a great deal of engravings.

40:46.428 --> 40:50.533
It's four volumes, right?

40:50.573 --> 40:51.855
What was the date on that again?

40:53.276 --> 40:54.278
17.

40:56.140 --> 40:57.141
That's okay, don't bother.

40:59.144 --> 41:00.345
It's a couple hundred years old.

41:01.446 --> 41:02.788
Yes, it's 18th century.

41:05.468 --> 41:08.672
and the lithographs there, some beautiful lithos.

41:10.474 --> 41:19.845
These are beautiful, which they, due to their size, are very difficult to sell.

41:19.865 --> 41:20.706
Oh, my God.

41:21.507 --> 41:22.428
Spectacular binding.

41:22.488 --> 41:22.828
Wow.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.411
Magnificent.

41:27.774 --> 41:28.735
Book of that size.

41:31.999 --> 41:32.820
Large folder.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.902
Yeah, so this one has to be a large folder.

41:35.303 --> 41:47.034
That's almost a double elephant photo, isn't it?

41:47.675 --> 41:49.096
I can't help you.

41:49.457 --> 41:51.239
I can barely lift up my own briefcase.

41:51.259 --> 41:51.999
You'll have to forgive me.

41:52.780 --> 41:58.305
Oh, my God.

41:58.345 --> 42:01.969
It's...

42:05.223 --> 42:14.077
Coronation of King George IV, printed by John Whittaker in real gold.

42:16.822 --> 42:17.082
Wow.

42:22.310 --> 42:23.132
Oh, my goodness.

42:24.394 --> 42:26.978
It's from the collection of the dukes.

42:28.240 --> 42:28.721
Oh.

42:28.741 --> 42:31.365
That's the one for painted arms.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.781
Oh, my God.

42:35.041 --> 42:37.023
That is amazing.

42:37.043 --> 42:37.904
Duke of Newcastle.

42:39.205 --> 42:40.086
And how old is this?

42:41.047 --> 42:52.598
This is 18... 23, I'm sorry.

42:54.159 --> 42:54.480
Wow.

42:56.261 --> 42:59.064
How many copies of that exist?

42:59.304 --> 43:00.485
Very few.

43:01.266 --> 43:02.247
Ten or...

43:06.547 --> 43:07.669
Look at that.

43:10.312 --> 43:15.018
You know that Mr. Crow printed two books in gold.

43:15.038 --> 43:18.944
The other one was the Magna Carta, which I had a copy at one time.

43:19.885 --> 43:26.033
And to do this printing, he had to exert a great deal of force.

43:26.053 --> 43:28.416
So he eventually broke his press.

43:28.436 --> 43:36.267
And well,

43:36.938 --> 43:39.602
And that's, the binding is?

43:39.642 --> 43:45.011
It's almost contemporary in English.

43:48.837 --> 43:50.239
And that's all, oh, wow.

43:51.421 --> 43:53.384
That's magnificent.

43:53.404 --> 43:54.746
Was that from your own collection?

43:55.127 --> 43:55.628
Yes.

43:55.648 --> 43:55.848
Yeah.

43:56.830 --> 43:58.412
I figured it's beautiful.

44:00.796 --> 44:02.659
You'll have to forgive me, I can't help you.

44:07.432 --> 44:13.000
And then these are more like the French books, which I very much like.

44:14.702 --> 44:25.318
I just did this catalog on the bindings of Marius Michel, which was my last catalog, which has all these bindings, French music.

44:25.338 --> 44:26.379
That is gorgeous.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.063
You do all that yourself.

44:29.103 --> 44:29.804
That's amazing.

44:30.485 --> 44:31.386
So you scan.

44:31.426 --> 44:33.209
You have your own computer scanner.

44:34.110 --> 44:35.312
And so you'll scan...

44:36.305 --> 44:37.386
And it's all fast.

44:40.931 --> 44:54.269
So bindings, you really have... I'm very fond of bindings, but also I have to say I'm not... I don't like to collect bindings for their own sake.

44:54.349 --> 45:02.059
I mean, unless I like the content as well, it really doesn't give me much pleasure.

45:02.731 --> 45:08.040
I really don't want to buy them just for the findings.

45:08.060 --> 45:10.965
So there has to be some content in there.

45:10.985 --> 45:12.006
Yes, uh-huh.

45:12.026 --> 45:17.616
Also, I wouldn't like you to think that I just like big and fabulous.

45:17.636 --> 45:18.918
That's a natural fact.

45:18.938 --> 45:23.726
I mean, some of the things I like best are usually very small.

45:23.926 --> 45:29.295
Those little elsevers, they don't come much smaller than that, unless you go to miniature books.

45:32.583 --> 45:55.868
A text I very much like by Jean-Paul Sartre, his famous essay on the existentialism, and actually I had this done myself, I found the book, which I found very attractive because it's copy number one of the numbered edition.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.413
So you had a rebound?

46:01.743 --> 46:03.586
Now, did you retain the original binding?

46:03.626 --> 46:03.986
Yes.

46:05.108 --> 46:14.963
You know, you can do that on the French binding, retaining the wrappers, so you don't actually take away from the value.

46:16.205 --> 46:21.733
That's almost the perfect way to have a beautiful binding and to still respect the integrity of the original book.

46:21.753 --> 46:31.227
Exactly, yes, I think so.

46:31.443 --> 46:34.766
I've got fond of children's books also.

46:36.168 --> 46:47.419
For instance, there's this French artist called Benjamin Rabier, who's sort of the predecessor of Hergé who did the Tintin.

46:47.979 --> 46:59.931
And this is a copy of one of these albums with all the original drawings and the color proofs.

47:02.999 --> 47:03.700
That's wonderful.

47:03.740 --> 47:07.163
What's the year on this approximately?

47:07.183 --> 47:22.358
The 20th.

47:25.822 --> 47:29.445
So your kind of collection is what it was.

47:29.486 --> 47:31.988
It's basically you defined what it was.

47:32.008 --> 47:32.989
It didn't have to

47:33.796 --> 47:36.500
There were no specific items that had to be on there.

47:37.241 --> 47:40.286
They really had to be things that pleased you, apparently.

47:40.306 --> 47:41.588
Yes.

47:41.969 --> 47:44.853
It's not like collecting a certain author or a certain illustrator.

47:44.873 --> 47:53.506
It may grow out of it, but it usually wasn't a necessity.

47:54.448 --> 48:01.018
Here I have some more English books, you know, like that's the first edition you need to prove.

48:01.555 --> 48:05.059
Christmas books by Charles Dickens.

48:05.079 --> 48:10.724
I just bought the set of the first edition of Pinocchio, which is very rare.

48:10.784 --> 48:11.605
It is very rare.

48:14.588 --> 48:17.271
Or a wonderful copy of The Sentimental Journey.

48:20.794 --> 48:21.335
Look at that.

48:21.715 --> 48:22.676
Look at that.

48:23.337 --> 48:31.545
I mean, this may not appeal to everyone, but I thought it's extraordinary that someone at the turn of the century had this found in France

48:32.183 --> 48:34.446
And it's a copy of Robert Ho.

48:35.147 --> 48:36.329
Oh, that's Robert Ho.

48:36.349 --> 48:38.051
Yeah, it's a large, very good copy.

48:38.071 --> 48:38.972
What's the book again?

48:39.112 --> 48:40.474
A Sentimental Journey.

48:42.777 --> 48:52.430
And it's a subscriber's copy with the name inscribed and everything.

48:52.450 --> 48:55.454
It's just about... Who found that for Ho?

48:58.758 --> 48:59.980
Mercier.

49:02.896 --> 49:25.005
Stephen Gooden, the English engraver.

49:25.846 --> 49:30.613
He was considered to be the finest engraver of the century in England.

49:31.274 --> 49:34.859
This is Jesus' favorite, one of eight coffees on balance.

49:41.248 --> 49:42.770
And the engraver, what's for it?

49:43.251 --> 49:43.572
Steven.

49:44.793 --> 49:46.235
Yeah, it's P.H.

49:46.356 --> 49:53.646
Burton.

49:53.666 --> 49:54.908
That's very lovely.

49:55.090 --> 50:02.281
The paper is magnificent.

50:02.321 --> 50:03.984
It's vellum, actually.

50:04.444 --> 50:04.885
It's vellum.

50:04.905 --> 50:06.267
You said that one that made on vellum.

50:06.287 --> 50:07.028
I'm sorry.

50:11.956 --> 50:14.520
That whole book is vellum.

50:16.002 --> 50:16.302
Wow.

50:20.909 --> 50:24.034
Wonderful.

50:26.225 --> 50:27.607
That is absolutely exquisite.

50:28.728 --> 50:34.274
And the binding is, again... This is the publisher's binding.

50:34.294 --> 50:35.596
That's the publisher's binding?

50:45.047 --> 50:45.147
Yeah.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.470
One of my favorites.

50:47.490 --> 50:53.417
First edition of the Confessions of the English... Oh, my God.

50:53.497 --> 50:55.219
In the jewel-climbing buzzing.

50:55.537 --> 51:10.134
Again, maybe in Congress, but it's so beautiful.

51:10.154 --> 51:15.100
It's beautiful.

51:15.120 --> 51:15.540
Beautiful.

51:16.482 --> 51:17.423
A very choice.

51:17.863 --> 51:25.392
You know, the stock is probably... How many volumes would you estimate?

51:25.928 --> 51:30.953
I have 2,000 items.

51:31.253 --> 51:39.460
So it's a very choice select.

51:40.661 --> 51:54.014
Although I do quite like to... I do not want to give the impression that I am only from the very large, very expensive book.

51:54.034 --> 51:55.615
Again, I very much

51:56.000 --> 51:58.963
like very little charming books.

51:58.983 --> 52:05.209
This is quite a well-known writer of the early 20th century, German one.

52:06.170 --> 52:13.437
And I don't know, something like that I just love.

52:13.797 --> 52:20.164
But it's in perfect condition, which matters a lot, doesn't it?

52:20.864 --> 52:20.964
Yeah.

52:20.984 --> 52:25.669
But I've tried to buy small books, cheap books.

52:25.852 --> 52:28.115
But they have to be in the right condition.

52:28.215 --> 52:33.383
So, again, it's just as difficult to find, to buy the expensive ones.

52:33.683 --> 52:36.608
Well, if you're looking for the best possible condition.

52:39.592 --> 52:46.662
Sometimes these little things are much rarer than, like I said, I mean, if you have a schedule, everybody goes, oh, a schedule.

52:46.996 --> 52:52.945
Any year, in any year, you can buy five or ten shades, and you can have a little book, which is worth it.

52:52.965 --> 52:54.267
You'll see once in a lifetime.

52:54.408 --> 52:57.332
You'll see once in a lifetime.

52:57.573 --> 52:59.115
Look at this issue.

52:59.135 --> 52:59.235
1847.

52:59.255 --> 53:00.257
Look at the condition.

53:01.999 --> 53:03.221
No foxing.

53:03.301 --> 53:05.906
It's a German satirical book.

53:07.768 --> 53:08.229
Wonderful.

53:12.035 --> 53:12.436
Excellent.

53:12.856 --> 53:13.257
I'm not going to...
