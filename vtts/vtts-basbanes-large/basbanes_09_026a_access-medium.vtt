WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:09.054
So I know we're doing fine and this picks up as well.

00:11.656 --> 00:25.528
I guess what strikes me, having read all the stuff that's been going on over there and reading the book and the reviews, it is almost a case of white imitating art.

00:25.588 --> 00:28.370
Yeah, on penalties.

00:28.390 --> 00:31.793
Maybe we can enter the discussion in this way.

00:33.865 --> 00:36.347
find this amusing, ironic?

00:37.809 --> 00:54.744
Well, I was quite happy with the opening premise, you know, way back in the story that this novel about literary envy seemed to be stirring up a lot of literary envy.

00:55.144 --> 00:56.766
I was quite amused by that.

00:56.846 --> 01:03.872
But, you know, later on, the ironies were oppressive, I thought.

01:04.055 --> 01:17.892
particularly this one that Julian Barnes, you know, that a novel about literary enmity, the deal for that novel caused a literary enmity that wasn't there before.

01:18.693 --> 01:20.835
It did, so you're acknowledging that.

01:20.855 --> 01:21.536
Yeah.

01:21.556 --> 01:22.898
And I think that's not it.

01:23.058 --> 01:23.418
Yeah.

01:24.940 --> 01:27.723
That's no great news break or anything.

01:27.743 --> 01:34.011
And that began to give me the creeps a bit, that that should have, you know, that the,

01:34.649 --> 01:43.001
The novel turned out to be a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in that one area that did alarm me.

01:46.486 --> 01:53.356
And I do get the feeling every now and then that I'm in some kind of postmodern trap or joke.

01:53.376 --> 01:54.517
Not altogether pleasant feeling.

01:55.919 --> 02:04.251
But really I'm, by now, I'm sort of bored blind by those.

02:05.227 --> 02:07.129
What was the word again?

02:07.209 --> 02:13.056
Bored flying inside a guy that's been following me around.

02:13.096 --> 02:21.106
Really, I think the story isn't... There is no story.

02:21.126 --> 02:24.470
This fuss really isn't a manufacturer.

02:24.490 --> 02:26.192
I think we're here, and this is how you find it.

02:26.973 --> 02:28.915
The guy's trying to get his money for it.

02:28.935 --> 02:30.036
I mean, get what he's worth.

02:30.056 --> 02:31.918
What's wrong with that?

02:31.998 --> 02:35.082
So then you have to step back and say that the story is

02:35.686 --> 02:40.273
about England or about the British press or about certain elements in the British character.

02:41.975 --> 02:53.893
It is those energies that have manufactured a scandal or a fuss about pretty well nothing.

02:56.057 --> 03:01.865
So I try to turn it around and see it as a story about England rather than a story about me.

03:03.087 --> 03:04.309
And the New Yorker piece,

03:04.559 --> 03:11.088
I think it's Oprah, who says, at least it indicates that people still care about literary stories and stuff.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.390
That's a paraphrase.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.233
Yeah, I don't think it does indicate that.

03:15.795 --> 03:16.857
I think, well, literature.

03:16.937 --> 03:18.779
I think I wrote it down.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.683
I just had a period of time.

03:21.703 --> 03:25.108
Literature still rouses great passion.

03:25.809 --> 03:28.713
I think money still rouses great passion.

03:29.995 --> 03:33.300
But you could, I mean, the most...

03:33.803 --> 03:53.508
flattering way to look at it from my point of view is that in England to be a writer who makes any kind of impact is going to be a kind of tawdry impact because that's the only thing the media are capable of processing is tawdryness.

03:54.970 --> 03:58.014
They process it, they add to it, they manufacture it.

04:00.437 --> 04:02.359
At the top of this

04:04.111 --> 04:14.644
turret, exposed turret of British writers, Salman Rushdie, who has been, you know, treated lamentably by the British press for six years.

04:15.685 --> 04:19.270
And I'm way down the turret, but there's no one in between me and Sam Ra.

04:19.871 --> 04:31.485
Yeah, I mean, I'm getting a kind of very qualitative and relatively, completely harmless version of what he gets, which is, um,

04:33.845 --> 04:40.236
torrent of resentful jeering from the British press.

04:40.256 --> 04:47.428
You like to think it's because I've made an impact somehow, and this is the only form an impact can now take.

04:47.768 --> 04:50.994
Coarse, vulgar, carping.

04:52.336 --> 04:56.443
Do you think they're coming at you strictly because of the reports of...

04:56.744 --> 04:58.266
the money and the agents.

04:58.527 --> 05:07.421
Or do you think that if it hadn't have been this, I mean, you've got this thing about the teeth, which is preposterous.

05:07.461 --> 05:10.186
What's wrong with fixing your teeth?

05:10.466 --> 05:11.428
Yeah, and it's not.

05:11.448 --> 05:14.533
My daughter's going out for braces, and they're going to cost me a fortune.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.338
But you do it because she needs them.

05:17.698 --> 05:18.119
I do.

05:18.259 --> 05:21.925
Yeah, and you know, it's not an offer.

05:22.715 --> 05:23.977
I didn't have any choice about it.

05:23.997 --> 05:25.259
It wasn't the kind of cosmetic.

05:25.279 --> 05:28.403
Well, I don't even know why you should have to.

05:28.423 --> 05:29.365
Explain it.

05:29.425 --> 05:34.131
What the hell has that got to do with, as Bobby Fischer said, has that got to do with chess?

05:34.372 --> 05:34.672
Yeah.

05:35.694 --> 05:37.516
You said that about anything, I guess.

05:37.536 --> 05:37.757
Yeah.

05:38.358 --> 05:40.080
Would you like to try some of these?

05:40.761 --> 05:44.086
Yes, another one, please.

05:44.647 --> 05:46.309
I'm fine, thanks.

05:46.998 --> 05:53.065
Yeah, can I get some?

05:53.125 --> 05:57.309
Please help yourself.

05:57.369 --> 05:57.890
Thank you.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.512
Why don't you just take a dish?

05:59.532 --> 05:59.912
No, no, no, please.

05:59.932 --> 06:00.753
Let's get some lemon.

06:00.773 --> 06:00.873
Mmm.

06:00.893 --> 06:05.078
This is much more generous than I anticipated.

06:05.218 --> 06:07.040
Make a dish.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.563
You've got to swallow those.

06:09.583 --> 06:15.129
Before I use my... put a bunch of them here.

06:15.149 --> 06:15.469
That'd be great.

06:15.652 --> 06:19.818
Yeah, I mean, one likes to think that it would have... You like the bodies too?

06:20.078 --> 06:21.500
Yeah.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.444
That it would have taken some other form.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.027
Do you have a spoon?

06:26.047 --> 06:26.587
I've got a spoon.

06:26.607 --> 06:28.810
Why don't you just take some of that?

06:30.994 --> 06:31.594
Great.

06:32.516 --> 06:33.137
Thank you.

06:33.157 --> 06:33.617
I'm all set.

06:38.424 --> 06:45.574
But anyway, it's... The resentment is real.

06:47.309 --> 06:48.591
Was Wyatt a surprise?

06:48.611 --> 06:55.139
Or I think looking at it now, it's kind of predictable.

06:55.159 --> 06:55.940
It's all right now.

06:56.801 --> 06:59.405
She actually went in a sweet letter.

06:59.425 --> 07:10.159
Kind of apologizing and regretting the whole thing.

07:15.305 --> 07:15.966
I mean,

07:16.300 --> 07:22.449
I think she was more or less the only writer in England who didn't want me to get the deal.

07:22.469 --> 07:27.295
She went a little crazy.

07:27.316 --> 07:31.822
You certainly don't have to say that.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.024
That was everything, Jim.

07:33.044 --> 07:33.244
Excellent.

07:33.264 --> 07:33.584
Thank you.

07:33.604 --> 07:36.068
These are wonderful.

07:36.088 --> 07:46.122
The other aspect of it touched on in the New Yorker piece, which I really don't expect to follow me around America, is

07:47.536 --> 08:16.834
for some reason, old, vestigial, latent, anti-American feelings were... Yeah, I didn't... In the New Yorker piece, he was suggesting that you were... You were being accused of fratting, and it's like, you know, these women who went out with the occupying Nazis turned to be quite too lucky, quite nice to look.

08:17.067 --> 08:31.903
If I'd gone on holiday, they would accuse me of being a traitor.

08:31.923 --> 08:37.849
But really, I think it's almost inexplicable, except to English people.

08:37.929 --> 08:41.893
It's damn hard to explain to English people, too.

08:43.004 --> 08:45.246
Have you seen the film, the newspaper?

08:45.767 --> 08:48.569
No, I wanted to see that one.

08:48.669 --> 08:49.330
Yeah, you'd like it.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.273
Yeah, it's really, really fun.

08:52.293 --> 08:55.055
And I spent a lot of years in the newspaper business.

08:55.075 --> 08:58.919
It's one of the few that seems to have it.

08:58.939 --> 09:08.869
But the guy who's this one public, this guy was in charge of parking, and he's been in front of these really terrible tabloid poems.

09:08.889 --> 09:10.250
He says, why me, why me?

09:10.270 --> 09:12.572
And he says, because it was your turn, you know?

09:12.873 --> 09:21.506
I'm wondering if maybe, you know, maybe they saw a good story here.

09:21.987 --> 09:23.209
What was the public reaction?

09:23.249 --> 09:25.172
Were they eating this up over there?

09:25.192 --> 09:28.397
Well, I guess they were, because every paper was just doing it.

09:28.437 --> 09:34.206
It's not exactly like a princess died, you know, for the weekend or something.

09:38.405 --> 09:50.842
I'll never get to the bottom of it, but I can narrow it down in that... It's not the advance.

09:51.703 --> 10:03.238
And this can be proved as far as... A writer of the same publisher, two or three years ago, got an advance for two books for Â£400,000, and there wasn't a word about it.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.581
Who was that writer?

10:05.601 --> 10:06.302
Jim Crace.

10:08.020 --> 10:08.861
C-R-A-C.

10:12.506 --> 10:15.311
So it can't be to do with that, right?

10:15.471 --> 10:24.504
Because they tell me there's a sort of tripwire that goes on around $430,000, $40,000, where suddenly you can't do that.

10:25.045 --> 10:31.854
But you see, you tell me who he is, and I say Jim Who, but we all know who Martin Amos is, and we know who your father is.

10:31.955 --> 10:34.298
And so, you know, it was...

10:35.645 --> 10:39.091
Yeah, so there's a bit more tabloid recognition involved there.

10:39.672 --> 10:48.609
And, of course, you did have this image, whether deserved or undeserved, that's irrelevant, kind of the, uh, Juan Caribe, I guess, or the bad boy.

10:48.769 --> 10:50.773
Yeah.

10:50.813 --> 10:53.759
Yes, I go on being the boy, because I'm still on being the son.

10:53.779 --> 10:57.906
But, um, I think it must have something to do with me and my father.

10:57.926 --> 10:58.227
That's it.

11:00.265 --> 11:01.307
In what respect?

11:01.327 --> 11:05.434
Is it just about you, your father's son, or is this spectacular?

11:05.454 --> 11:25.328
I think it must be that because that's one thing that does single me out and awakens kind of feelings, perhaps, that it's all been too easy for me and that kind of thing.

11:26.692 --> 11:29.116
No one's suggesting that I get my novels published because I'm hidden.

11:29.136 --> 11:30.738
I was going to say, well, you've written your books, right?

11:32.581 --> 11:33.963
Nobody's written them for you.

11:34.464 --> 11:49.506
And let me say, let me go on the record, I will say this at a piece, for all the, and we've been hearing about this book and this stuff for a long time, so the anticipation for me was that the book is great.

11:49.847 --> 11:54.374
I think it really happens to be worth the hype that it's getting.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.956
This doesn't happen very often.

11:56.358 --> 12:03.524
I like the book, and very shortly, because I'm even getting as bored as you must be discussing this.

12:03.604 --> 12:04.585
I don't see it.

12:04.905 --> 12:05.846
There's nothing there.

12:06.266 --> 12:10.089
I'm trying to examine what the big deal is all about, so I do have to get a few quotes on it.

12:10.110 --> 12:16.935
I'm sure there's nothing that you haven't said and haven't gone over.

12:17.155 --> 12:26.263
I would like at some point to talk about, because I have read, it is interesting, that where both you and your father

12:26.665 --> 12:28.708
write improductively at the same time.

12:28.728 --> 12:35.296
I don't know if it's unique in the history of speaking literature.

12:35.416 --> 12:41.504
Do you really have to press the plants in some other parallels?

12:41.524 --> 12:42.065
I think you do.

12:45.670 --> 12:52.779
And I think the conventional thing is that writer-sons is writer-fathers.

12:54.421 --> 12:55.322
Write one or two books.

12:56.382 --> 12:59.145
and then have the grace to shut up and disappear.

13:00.206 --> 13:06.473
And I think it must be galling to some that that hasn't happened in this case.

13:07.615 --> 13:15.764
The only case I can think of, American case, but then again, Cheever was Cheever and his son Ben.

13:15.964 --> 13:20.129
But Ben, I don't think, published his first novel until after his father died.

13:21.030 --> 13:23.012
Susan had a couple of books.

13:23.032 --> 13:23.132
Yeah.

13:24.445 --> 13:32.877
Yeah, but not a kind of more or less equivalent.

13:33.698 --> 13:34.179
Oh, no.

13:34.319 --> 13:37.924
Well, you both did quite seriously at the same time.

13:38.144 --> 13:42.230
I mean, he's still quite alive and writing and producing.

13:42.691 --> 13:43.232
He is.

13:43.332 --> 13:48.018
And that is, did you see Machico's review in the New York Times?

13:48.219 --> 13:48.679
I did, yes.

13:48.699 --> 13:49.841
It was a really nice review.

13:49.881 --> 13:50.622
Yes, wasn't it?

13:50.888 --> 13:54.774
And she did find some residents from one of your father's novels.

13:55.374 --> 13:55.655
Yeah.

13:56.055 --> 13:57.738
And did you agree with that?

13:57.858 --> 14:01.704
And I'm going to ask you to come and have a lot of reviews with it.

14:01.724 --> 14:05.369
It was a pretty interesting observation, I think.

14:05.389 --> 14:08.313
I was certainly aware of one or two little glances of Lucky Jim.

14:08.914 --> 14:11.718
I wonder if she was thinking of the same bit.

14:11.738 --> 14:13.200
She didn't say, at least.

14:14.142 --> 14:17.807
I agreed with the Tom Wolfe stuff, to a degree.

14:18.468 --> 14:20.130
To a degree, and I'll explain why.

14:21.071 --> 14:29.102
For me, because The Bonfire of the Vanity is as much a novel about New York as it was anything else.

14:29.162 --> 14:31.364
And this is a novel of suburban life.

14:31.725 --> 14:36.091
That's true, and there is sort of the underside impinging on the... Yeah.

14:36.331 --> 14:39.475
I mean, it's not Vanity Fair, but nevertheless, it is...

14:40.147 --> 14:41.789
It is life in the city.

14:41.849 --> 14:43.051
That's right.

14:43.111 --> 14:45.053
And the high and the low element.

14:45.353 --> 14:45.834
Exactly.

14:45.914 --> 14:47.636
I think that's what Wolfe is doing.

14:48.117 --> 14:48.777
Yeah.

14:49.238 --> 14:49.939
Yeah.

14:49.979 --> 14:50.980
One of the many things.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.382
Yeah, I like that book very much.

14:53.523 --> 14:54.965
Fantastically.

14:55.145 --> 14:55.526
Yeah.

14:55.546 --> 14:55.986
Yeah.

14:56.126 --> 14:56.847
I enjoy it.

14:57.468 --> 14:58.549
He's taken a long time.

14:58.910 --> 14:59.150
Yeah.

14:59.230 --> 15:02.214
Now, this is five years, they say, in the making, on the best lap.

15:04.336 --> 15:09.883
Did you, according to another piece I read, this is, you, you,

15:10.336 --> 15:12.839
Of course, it is a novel about midlife crisis.

15:13.960 --> 15:21.768
Can we project and say, you know, maybe this is something that you yourself are experiencing in some manner?

15:22.109 --> 15:25.933
Oh, yeah.

15:25.953 --> 15:28.135
I mean... What is the nature of your midlife crisis?

15:28.195 --> 15:28.796
I'm curious.

15:28.836 --> 15:36.724
I mean, other than... I'm not really interested in domestic problems, but as a professional, as a writer.

15:36.744 --> 15:39.347
Well, when you have a midlife crisis,

15:40.711 --> 15:42.133
You know, your life is shaken up.

15:42.614 --> 15:49.704
It's not that you intend to shake it up, but these things nonetheless happen willy-nilly.

15:52.929 --> 15:59.218
You know, and I've had some pretty classic symptoms of the midnight crisis.

16:00.399 --> 16:03.864
A health crisis, you know, a separate, you know, end of a marriage.

16:05.166 --> 16:09.773
The various...

16:10.040 --> 16:17.909
comparatively, minor sundering to do with my agent, my publisher.

16:20.511 --> 16:22.193
My agent is a very old friend.

16:22.934 --> 16:24.656
Your current agent or the former agent?

16:24.676 --> 16:32.344
Former agent, but the agent part of it is a business relationship.

16:35.908 --> 16:36.469
I believe

16:37.124 --> 16:41.649
I believed I could go on being friends with her, and I believed I could go on being friends with Julie.

16:43.310 --> 16:48.035
It seemed to me not remarkable if that had taken place, if we'd gone on being friends.

16:48.055 --> 16:49.537
I mean, it was a kind of messy switch.

16:51.058 --> 17:01.990
This must be the principal... I mean, the most unhappy consequence of this whole thing is what one must assume is the fracture of a friendship.

17:04.653 --> 17:06.034
But I didn't know I was going to...

17:06.824 --> 17:19.821
It would have seemed to me just as intelligible if Julian had written to me saying, let's not let this affect our friendship.

17:19.841 --> 17:26.530
In other words, I didn't calculate on losing his friendship.

17:29.974 --> 17:34.500
Well, you made a business to say that.

17:34.520 --> 17:34.620
Yeah.

17:36.727 --> 17:37.248
Exactly.

17:37.268 --> 17:38.130
What does the lawyer say?

17:38.150 --> 17:41.557
I mean, the lawyer who defends himself as a rule for a client.

17:41.577 --> 17:43.962
I mean, you can extend that.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.567
You should never do business with friends, you know, for instance.

17:46.587 --> 17:52.579
I mean, because it becomes personal.

17:52.599 --> 17:53.200
I mean, what does it say?

17:54.597 --> 17:56.119
You made a decision.

17:56.299 --> 18:04.048
I would assume that your interests were better served by bringing in somebody else.

18:04.068 --> 18:06.191
That's my take on it.

18:06.371 --> 18:06.591
Yeah.

18:06.651 --> 18:08.133
Period, paragraph, next case.

18:08.453 --> 18:11.918
Yeah.

18:11.938 --> 18:18.265
My agent is the guy who got Luke Gingrich four and a half million dollars.

18:18.285 --> 18:21.509
Wouldn't I have loved... You had to give it back, didn't you?

18:21.569 --> 18:23.271
Well, you didn't have to, but...

18:23.993 --> 18:27.799
I talked to my agent about this, and he said, well, he said, we'll make that.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.462
I mean, they didn't rescind the deal.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.206
All they did was rescind the advance.

18:33.226 --> 18:33.347
Right.

18:33.367 --> 18:38.554
Their confidence, certainly, that they'll get the advance is nice.

18:39.035 --> 18:46.385
And when I got for an advance, it seems to me an advance is an advance.

18:46.445 --> 18:49.330
I mean, you take it literally.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.094
If you earn, if you make money, you make money, right?

18:52.274 --> 18:53.055
Yeah.

18:53.525 --> 18:56.269
It's nice to get a big thing, if you can get it.

18:56.369 --> 19:03.921
Andrew Waddy says, if you ever get a royalty check, something's gone wrong.

19:06.866 --> 19:11.893
I think it will do well, though.

19:11.913 --> 19:14.938
How is it doing at England, by the way?

19:14.958 --> 19:18.664
I think it's still something that could be talented.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.388
What's a bestseller over there?

19:22.330 --> 19:28.336
There was enough to get a number one fiction harlot for a couple of weeks.

19:30.758 --> 19:35.462
In England, anything over 20,000, 20,000 of us.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.869
Maybe we could talk a bit about that.

19:42.229 --> 19:50.717
I mean, you are correctly regarded as a literary writer.

19:52.705 --> 19:57.812
You know, I tried to get an interview with John Updike once, and he wrote me a interview.

19:57.832 --> 19:59.274
He hates to do interviews, and I respect that.

19:59.454 --> 20:03.600
Ann Taller has never given any interviews.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.385
Before, he said, you know, I'm not the one who's getting paid for this article.

20:07.405 --> 20:09.588
He wrote me a long, furious letter.

20:10.129 --> 20:15.156
He invited me to ask him some factual questions by letter, which I did.

20:16.317 --> 20:17.359
And then he wrote back.

20:17.379 --> 20:18.220
He was furious.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.742
And then they quoted a letter.

20:21.005 --> 20:24.970
But the thrust of what he was saying is, hey, we're all writing for money.

20:26.272 --> 20:27.313
My time is money.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.157
Don't waste my time with this.

20:31.299 --> 20:36.045
Did you ask him questions that you could have answered yourself?

20:36.105 --> 20:41.973
No, I asked him some questions that I really did try to engage him with.

20:42.294 --> 20:47.080
He wanted what he called factual questions.

20:48.629 --> 20:52.216
You can probably do those and get those out of the file.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.961
Which is ridiculous, yeah.

20:54.981 --> 20:57.044
This is quite a few years ago.

20:57.064 --> 20:57.325
It was fun.

20:57.465 --> 21:01.773
I have the letter.

21:01.793 --> 21:02.134
It's a great one.

21:02.154 --> 21:09.768
Anyway, Updike is one of our greatest, well, I mean, there's a great judgment, but I like him.

21:09.788 --> 21:11.110
Oh, yeah.

21:11.883 --> 21:13.545
Nobody knocks him.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.908
I mean, have you ever seen all the signed limited things that he does?

21:16.188 --> 21:16.548
No.

21:16.569 --> 21:17.930
He has the world record.

21:17.950 --> 21:18.971
He's got about 800 of them.

21:19.432 --> 21:19.912
What are they?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.855
You know, these little things that they do 150.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.960
It might be some piece that never got into the New Yorker or got into the New Yorker.

21:26.520 --> 21:30.805
And they will do these signed limited editions of these little... They collect it?

21:30.865 --> 21:32.928
Yeah, but they get 150 bucks a whack for them.

21:32.948 --> 21:35.471
And he does them by the dozen.

21:35.491 --> 21:35.731
Really?

21:36.292 --> 21:39.055
And I mentioned this in my book.

21:39.473 --> 21:42.819
There's a guy in New York, Carter Burden, who I described.

21:42.839 --> 21:44.723
He's got hundreds of pieces.

21:44.743 --> 21:46.286
I've got too many to quit on him now.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.249
I can't afford to quit on him.

21:48.269 --> 21:50.734
Nobody whacks up for this.

21:50.854 --> 21:56.024
We're wanting to make a little money out of this.

21:56.044 --> 21:57.126
What the hell are we doing it for?

21:57.406 --> 21:58.208
We love it.

21:58.348 --> 21:58.849
Fine.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.024
I've got kids, you've paid kids.

22:01.044 --> 22:03.006
We have to support them.

22:03.026 --> 22:06.429
My kids have to sit problems that I have to address.

22:06.629 --> 22:09.332
Nobody's going to rape me over the poles, I hope.

22:09.352 --> 22:14.296
I'm deciding what my children deserve for $5,000 worth in dental work.

22:14.956 --> 22:18.219
This is preposterous to me.

22:18.239 --> 22:21.522
It's totally preposterous.

22:21.542 --> 22:28.228
Once the hostile appetite is awakened, then anything you do is, you know,

22:28.478 --> 22:30.120
is grist.

22:31.841 --> 22:34.324
So let's think, he's having a lot of dental work.

22:35.065 --> 22:39.969
That must be because he's vain, that he wants to grin for photographers.

22:39.990 --> 22:52.202
And when I was embarking on all this dental treatment and staggering around the streets of New York, sort of spitting right into the pavement, I thought, I knew this was going to be unpleasant, all this dental work.

22:52.342 --> 22:57.507
But I didn't know I was going to get dumped on by every paper in England.

22:58.027 --> 23:16.700
And also, I mean, they thought, in the anti-American vein, they thought, American dentists, American agents, American girlfriends, aren't all dentists good enough for you?

23:16.760 --> 23:20.727
Haven't we got enough blow torches?

23:20.787 --> 23:22.009
Good enough for you.

23:22.951 --> 23:24.714
Could I use that as a quote, by the way?

23:25.014 --> 23:27.818
I mean, I put words in your mouth on that.

23:27.838 --> 23:28.419
No, no.

23:32.305 --> 23:33.827
Well, then my wife is American, too.

23:33.847 --> 23:34.909
Do you roll these?

23:34.929 --> 23:36.952
Yeah, I do.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.201
I used to smoke cigars.

23:43.242 --> 23:47.568
Well, I gave them up.

23:47.588 --> 23:49.511
Did you give them up because you had to?

23:49.531 --> 23:51.574
No, I had to.

23:51.908 --> 23:57.134
I smoked it for 20 years when I was back in the Navy and started it.

23:57.154 --> 24:07.286
I figured 20 years, maybe 20,000, 30,000 cigars I gave it.

24:07.406 --> 24:11.791
When I smoked... You were in heaven.

24:11.891 --> 24:15.035
It's a great nostalgic, awakening smell.

24:17.678 --> 24:18.979
So they thought about that and they thought,

24:19.837 --> 24:26.184
Okay, he lives in Manhattan with his new girlfriend, having abandoned his children.

24:26.764 --> 24:28.907
It's really untrue.

24:29.527 --> 24:33.572
But he spends a lot of time in America to become, lives in America.

24:33.592 --> 24:38.957
And that's good because it means I must have abandoned my children.

24:38.977 --> 24:39.918
Is that your name?

24:39.938 --> 24:40.539
I think so, yeah.

24:40.899 --> 24:43.122
Thank you.

24:43.142 --> 24:43.902
It was delicious.

24:44.203 --> 24:44.443
It was good.

24:49.402 --> 24:56.130
But then, since we are living in the postmodern age and perception is all, etc.

24:58.914 --> 25:03.860
I didn't say, during the initial start, I didn't say a word to anyone of the press.

25:04.901 --> 25:09.267
And then when publication neared, I did of course a lot of interviews.

25:10.348 --> 25:17.637
And I commented on the treatment I've had so far and say I was scandalized by it and I didn't stop to think about it.

25:18.106 --> 25:22.332
And there's a whole lot of wave of pieces about whether I was right to be scandalised for that.

25:22.812 --> 25:27.359
And all the journalists decided on the whole not, that I shouldn't complain.

25:27.379 --> 25:33.086
But another English thing is, if you do get a chunk of money like that, then you can damn well put up with anything else.

25:33.106 --> 25:40.817
And a lot of the things, the tone of them, the poor little rich boy my nose has been complaining about his people.

25:40.837 --> 25:41.558
What am I supposed to say?

25:41.578 --> 25:45.463
That they've treated me very sweetly and sympathetically?

25:46.186 --> 25:48.429
Do you feel that you're a better person?

25:48.489 --> 25:51.854
I mean, this is such a cliche question.

25:52.275 --> 25:56.240
Are you bemused by this whole thing?

25:56.341 --> 25:59.425
Are you bruised by it?

25:59.505 --> 26:11.843
I was bruised by the tone of some of the reviews simply because I'm not used to being... I think it's a good thing to get 50-50 reviews.

26:11.883 --> 26:15.568
The best kind of reviews are violently pro and violently anti.

26:16.207 --> 26:28.386
You don't want all to be good because then you're being sort of gathered into the commonality in a way that good writers shouldn't have once be.

26:28.606 --> 26:33.574
Well, are they reviewing the book or are they reviewing the story?

26:33.594 --> 26:35.276
They're reviewing the book.

26:35.416 --> 26:36.238
But that's good.

26:36.258 --> 26:44.290
It's so soured by everything that I'm not used to being written about as if I'm no good at all.

26:44.624 --> 26:51.330
Even the old hostile reviews they used to get, saying that he was misusing his talent or something.

26:51.350 --> 26:57.695
But I got several reviews of this book, saying that this is as if the book had been written for money.

26:57.715 --> 27:02.640
And of course, the book was finished before any negotiations began.

27:02.660 --> 27:03.901
I was shocked by that.

27:04.662 --> 27:13.129
Otherwise, you know, the old American phrase, what doesn't clearly makes you stronger,

27:13.565 --> 27:41.817
uh and after all you know we are just talking about there are no sticks and stones so far as this being words there are worse fates did you see this as a as your best shot yet i hate to say commercial novel but it's certainly something that might reach a broader yeah i did i felt it was a it was a in a way quieter and um

27:44.227 --> 27:49.214
less tricksy novel.

27:50.095 --> 27:59.288
It was about more recognizable and clearly universal concerns than some of its predecessors.

28:00.750 --> 28:08.020
And I do think that my readership in England is slightly ghettoized.

28:09.502 --> 28:10.844
Cultish.

28:10.864 --> 28:11.464
Ghettoized.

28:12.326 --> 28:14.048
Cultish.

28:14.753 --> 28:22.406
It's touched on in the book that I've done co-signing, where I look at my cue, and I look at the cues of others.

28:22.426 --> 28:24.129
And I think I want some of them in my cue.

28:24.610 --> 28:27.675
My cue is sort of rather punky and wild-eyed, you know.

28:28.055 --> 28:29.698
In England, not so much for America.

28:30.920 --> 28:37.111
And I think actually, you know, older readers would like my stuff too.

28:37.131 --> 28:40.356
But they're put off by this kind of bad boy image.

28:41.163 --> 28:45.990
So I did feel that they had a chance of roping into more readers.

28:47.011 --> 28:51.197
And whatever is said, it's not the advance, it's not anything else.

28:51.217 --> 28:53.480
What you want is reading.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.623
A writer is nothing without a reader.

28:55.863 --> 28:58.126
He's only half a circle.

28:59.508 --> 29:05.216
And I admit to being ravenous and gluttonous for readers.

29:05.516 --> 29:08.520
I want as many as I can get.

29:09.462 --> 29:16.857
So I did feel that I could get a whole new section of the populace.

29:18.159 --> 29:27.458
When we were trying to sell my book, I was saying to my agent, I said, does the amount of the advance mean anything?

29:27.478 --> 29:29.682
Because you have to earn anything naively.

29:29.797 --> 29:55.416
he said it means a lot they said because if they have a great state in the book they're going to toss their ass to make it to make sure they're publicized they get it fast and you know they're going to work if they've only got uh 50 grand or something in you which is a lot of money they'll think it's nice if it does well but no harm it doesn't take much to earn out and so we don't really have to kill ourselves and they can and

29:55.396 --> 29:56.900
It can be a successful work.

29:56.941 --> 29:59.167
It might even take off, but who knows?

29:59.568 --> 30:01.534
Without us doing much about it, it might take off.

30:01.554 --> 30:04.382
So it does really behoove them to get behind it.

30:04.743 --> 30:06.047
And so that, I think...

30:06.398 --> 30:08.521
That's very much the thinking.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.884
Was that part of it with you when we were talking about the midlife crisis?

30:10.924 --> 30:12.145
Was it a sense of worth?

30:12.245 --> 30:12.506
Yeah.

30:12.526 --> 30:14.508
Of demonstrating to yourself absolute worth?

30:14.809 --> 30:17.152
In those very words, I'll put it to myself.

30:17.172 --> 30:17.833
Is that right?

30:17.853 --> 30:18.093
Yeah.

30:18.353 --> 30:24.701
You want to know, you know, I thought I'm never going to be 45 again with a, with maybe I'll never have a big novel again.

30:24.721 --> 30:29.267
You know, an novel that's taken so long to write.

30:30.168 --> 30:35.595
I'm repeatedly, I'm repeatedly singled out as

30:36.014 --> 30:39.939
You know, the most imitated writer of my generation, whatever that means.

30:39.959 --> 30:41.822
The most influential writer of my generation.

30:42.583 --> 30:43.164
In England?

30:43.324 --> 30:43.885
In England.

30:44.245 --> 30:55.420
So why not, you know, also you think, in a kind of innocent way, you think, well, Ian McEwan, my friend, got a big one, a few novels back.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.943
Well, how about a big one for me?

30:59.025 --> 31:04.452
Do you accept that characterization that you are, the writer of yours?

31:04.837 --> 31:09.488
I think I'm the most imitated, but I don't know probably what that means.

31:09.509 --> 31:12.957
I'll tell you who I interviewed years ago over at the Ritz.

31:12.977 --> 31:15.523
It was this Jason Epps thing.

31:15.844 --> 31:17.007
Do you remember that?

31:17.122 --> 31:17.963
Jacob.

31:18.283 --> 31:18.764
Jacob?

31:18.784 --> 31:19.365
Yeah.

31:19.385 --> 31:20.506
Jason was the father.

31:21.006 --> 31:21.647
Jason's the father.

31:21.687 --> 31:22.688
Yeah, yeah.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.350
He imitated me a bit.

31:24.430 --> 31:31.118
Well, you've not heard anything about that kid.

31:31.138 --> 31:33.881
I know that he's an extremely successful scriptwriter.

31:34.222 --> 31:34.502
Really?

31:34.522 --> 31:35.183
He writes L.A.

31:35.223 --> 31:36.584
Law and stuff like that.

31:36.604 --> 31:37.886
No kidding.

31:37.906 --> 31:38.206
Yeah.

31:38.226 --> 31:40.929
He's a whole lot richer than me, and good luck to him.

31:41.129 --> 31:46.015
I had to be the guy on the tape.

31:46.315 --> 31:55.263
But he said it's amazing to him the money that the scriptwriters make.

31:55.824 --> 31:58.747
They're doing 120-page treatment, but they do it.

31:58.827 --> 31:59.728
They do have a skill.

32:00.148 --> 32:01.589
They're able to do it.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.771
There's a lot of people trying to do it.

32:03.892 --> 32:07.475
Scott Fitzgerald, I mean, you want to go back, I mean, Dave and Faulkner.

32:07.495 --> 32:08.936
Faulkner couldn't do it.

32:08.996 --> 32:12.079
I think it's more successful than Fitzgerald.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.922
No, I mean, everything's relative.

32:15.458 --> 32:43.238
the real anomaly is this that um while this was all just settling down um or the the deal at any rate had been done i went to los angeles to interview john travolta and he's been very clever with his money travolta and it emerged he's you know hugely rich and got three airplanes three airplanes and i was thinking

32:44.129 --> 32:50.940
I was thinking, I don't resent him having that, you know, good luck to him, but I was thinking, he's got three aeroplanes and I drive a rabbit.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.983
He's got a Gulfstream, I've got a rabbit.

32:53.624 --> 32:58.071
And he really hasn't done much since this recent movie.

32:58.091 --> 33:00.254
Right, no, he's a comeback.

33:00.875 --> 33:09.088
But then I thought, but no one minds that, in England or America, Joshua, they're being wonderfully rich.

33:10.090 --> 33:11.672
So it turns out, does it not, that

33:12.158 --> 33:18.066
The literary novel is the only human activity that one shouldn't get well rewarded for.

33:18.087 --> 33:18.627
Do you remember that?

33:18.647 --> 33:25.197
You don't remember, but back in the 50s and 60s, I was quite a jazz band.

33:25.217 --> 33:30.444
There would be certain groups that you enjoyed enormously, and then they would say, well, they're selling them.

33:30.685 --> 33:33.248
Yeah, I've heard that phrase used in me.

33:33.268 --> 33:35.732
In other words, they're going mainstream.

33:35.752 --> 33:42.081
They're actually going to try and emerge from poverty and stop eating potato chips for the lives of living in them.

33:42.179 --> 33:44.442
and the carrots, and the rats.

33:45.663 --> 33:52.331
But even that, you see, is something that I think is nonsensical to say of me, that I'm selling out.

33:52.351 --> 33:54.513
Because selling out when?

33:54.634 --> 34:02.022
I wrote that novel as I would have written any other novel, my next novel, and then put that to one side, and then did the negotiation.

34:02.042 --> 34:02.923
They weren't connected.

34:04.165 --> 34:09.671
The novel wasn't written to be sold, so to speak.

34:09.731 --> 34:10.532
No.

34:11.018 --> 34:12.860
two separate activities, one not.

34:13.421 --> 34:21.111
And the fact is, and then we will leave the subject, and get the book itself, which is a considerably important thing.

34:21.732 --> 34:28.441
If somebody doesn't, maybe this, I should think it applies in England, but here, you know, willing buyer, willing seller.

34:28.461 --> 34:32.326
If they don't want to give you the money, nobody's putting a gun into their heads.

34:32.927 --> 34:39.355
I mean, if somebody wants to pay a baseball player $5 million a year, a semi-literate baseball player,

34:39.824 --> 34:42.307
and they're paying them to the player.

34:42.787 --> 34:45.010
I don't have to buy tickets to win another game.

34:45.030 --> 34:45.991
You don't have to do this.

34:46.431 --> 34:47.032
But they do it.

34:47.092 --> 34:48.453
You know why?

34:48.473 --> 34:51.056
Because they bought this guy Ken Seiko here in Boston.

34:51.076 --> 34:52.238
He fills the park.

34:52.318 --> 34:53.799
They make the money back in two weeks.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.521
So they know what they're doing.

34:55.942 --> 34:57.403
So he brings success to the property.

34:57.864 --> 34:58.264
That's right.

34:58.284 --> 34:58.645
Whatever.

34:58.805 --> 34:59.786
Well, it's whatever.

35:00.687 --> 35:06.433
Nobody had to do that in such a ridiculously rudimentary observation.

35:06.513 --> 35:09.156
I'm embarrassed to make it.

35:09.473 --> 35:12.656
Is this a watershed book for you, in your view?

35:12.856 --> 35:15.719
It sort of feels like it, yeah.

35:15.759 --> 35:21.565
Now we are making a transition to the writing, to the writing and to the book.

35:21.765 --> 35:22.005
Sure.

35:22.386 --> 35:26.049
It does feel that way.

35:26.089 --> 35:33.517
I don't know what my next novel will be, although I have a handful of short stories I'm keen to write.

35:36.059 --> 35:37.220
Keen to write or keen to publish?

35:37.260 --> 35:38.822
Keen to write.

35:40.895 --> 35:49.063
It feels like the end of a kind of informal trilogy with the two other long novels I've written, London Fields and Money.

35:49.844 --> 35:55.469
And they're all West London novels, basically, with a kind of American presence in each of them.

35:58.032 --> 36:03.677
But I'm moving out of West London now, and I'm moving to North West London.

36:03.697 --> 36:08.362
And I don't know how significant that sort of two or three mile shift is going to be.

36:09.223 --> 36:10.564
But I kind of felt...

36:10.831 --> 36:13.695
that I've come to the end of that.

36:13.715 --> 36:23.930
You know, I'd call it an informal trilogy, but you have a countervailing suspicion that actually these are just the sort of novels I'm going to write.

36:24.971 --> 36:29.057
Longish books with recurring themes.

36:29.117 --> 36:35.406
What are the recurring themes that make them, in your mind, the trilogy?

36:35.506 --> 36:40.213
They're all... They all have a...

36:40.565 --> 36:57.406
There are about uncertain identities monitored by a kind of writer figure.

36:57.986 --> 37:04.935
There's always a writer figure or a me figure as well, manipulating

37:05.877 --> 37:15.413
manipulating and humiliating a little truth of rheumatist personality.

37:15.433 --> 37:30.197
Through a recurring motif to me, it's just a feeling I have, a sense that this is one long novel, split up.

37:30.515 --> 37:34.539
although they're all, you know, interdependent, too, and independent.

37:34.559 --> 37:59.745
With Nadine Gortimer, while she was here doing some lectures at Harvard, and she's quite, as you know, quite a prolific writer, but she feels that everything, she made a comparison, like, there's one statue, and for her it's like walking around and seeing the same story or the same statue from different angles, and it really is a corpus.

38:00.130 --> 38:06.759
and everything is, well, I don't expect metaphors here, but it's, you know, all parts of the same.

38:07.600 --> 38:11.345
And do you feel that way, that maybe it is, if you are writing one of you?

38:12.046 --> 38:18.595
I think maybe I'm staring at the statue from the same angle, but with failing eyesight.

38:18.615 --> 38:24.443
You know, I interviewed Graham Greene years ago.

38:24.463 --> 38:25.664
Yeah, it was great.

38:26.045 --> 38:28.568
And I thought, you know,

38:29.223 --> 38:32.026
P is almost the paradigm of this.

38:32.046 --> 38:36.972
You have your own country, in his case, for Greenland, usually.

38:37.172 --> 38:41.016
And this is your patch, this is all you need.

38:41.036 --> 38:45.461
You need one adulterer, you need one pamper tower, etc.

38:45.481 --> 38:47.623
You need one failed holy man.

38:49.986 --> 38:55.332
And all that changes is that you get older as you write about it.

38:55.514 --> 38:57.136
Well, the perceptions must change.

38:57.436 --> 39:05.026
Perceptions change through time, but the actual address of the eye... I mean, this novel certainly wasn't possible for you at the age of 30.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.288
Yeah, sure.

39:06.308 --> 39:10.393
I think it had to be undertaken by a man in his early 40s.

39:10.453 --> 39:11.154
Yeah.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.376
And is that fair?

39:12.476 --> 39:13.597
Absolutely, yeah.

39:13.617 --> 39:16.041
I couldn't have written it until I'd arrived then.

39:16.561 --> 39:24.171
And in fact, you know, the book is... I felt very much, as I was coming to the end of my 30s, I used to feel...

39:24.556 --> 39:27.961
not arrogantly, but kind of wearily, that I understood everything.

39:28.642 --> 39:32.207
People were almost ridiculously transparent to me.

39:32.227 --> 39:33.829
I knew what they were thinking.

39:34.891 --> 39:41.160
And then suddenly, around about the age of 40, I thought, I don't know anything about anything anymore.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.662
Because I'm now in a new country.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.887
I don't know how to use the currency.

39:45.927 --> 39:47.770
I don't know how to use the subway.

39:50.073 --> 39:51.255
My head has been emptied out.

39:51.275 --> 39:52.116
And this is really because

39:53.041 --> 39:58.147
what you know up until around 40 years of no use to you with the second half of life.

39:58.187 --> 40:02.412
You have to learn a whole new set of rules.

40:02.432 --> 40:09.540
And that book is an attempt to sort of, to grope towards some kind of information about the second half of life.

40:09.560 --> 40:15.266
The second half of life which is much more shadowed by death than the first half.

40:15.286 --> 40:18.390
Well, the shadow of death is really just a rumour.

40:18.623 --> 40:22.469
Did you see it also as being a funny novel?

40:22.849 --> 40:23.230
Oh, yeah.

40:23.410 --> 40:25.974
I don't... Is it satire in your room?

40:26.194 --> 40:28.738
I've not seen it described as such.

40:28.978 --> 40:30.480
Well, what would it be satirizing?

40:31.201 --> 40:32.724
It would be satirizing in the literary world.

40:33.365 --> 40:48.006
I do exaggerate deliberately to search for comedy, but Northrop Frye describes satire of militant irony in that it's irony that is attempting to bring about some change.

40:49.167 --> 40:54.374
like Swift's modest proposal definitely had a sort of political age.

40:54.855 --> 41:00.482
And I don't think I, I never feel I'm doing that.

41:00.502 --> 41:04.367
I think it's, it's sharp and blank.

41:11.617 --> 41:16.103
But I think I'm incapable of writing anything that isn't basically comic in premise.

41:16.353 --> 41:17.254
in some way.

41:17.694 --> 41:25.983
Even the novel I wrote about the Holocaust has a great deal of irony in it.

41:26.043 --> 41:30.368
I'd be ashamed to call it a comedy, but nonetheless it uses the devices of comedy.

41:30.528 --> 41:34.532
Do you remember, what was the Netflix film, the producers?

41:34.552 --> 41:34.832
Yeah.

41:35.293 --> 41:38.816
That's the springtime reel.

41:39.077 --> 41:40.718
That's the Hitler.

41:40.979 --> 41:45.263
Looking at them doing the Swiss together.

41:45.513 --> 41:46.595
Wonderful movie.

41:46.615 --> 41:48.838
Wonderful.

41:49.660 --> 41:50.521
Thank you very much.

41:50.541 --> 41:55.108
And you have asserted that this is most definitely not a Romano play.

41:55.128 --> 41:56.530
Yeah.

41:56.550 --> 42:05.184
I wouldn't be interested in writing a minimalist short story, actually.

42:07.428 --> 42:08.309
I make things up.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.272
That's what I like to do.

42:10.403 --> 42:14.287
The idea of spending five years lampooning your friends seems to me.

42:14.627 --> 42:16.029
That's the frivolity.

42:16.669 --> 42:23.196
No, that's just a way to make it a gossip item.

42:24.397 --> 42:27.180
Were there models from each of the writers?

42:28.441 --> 42:30.684
Yes, but they both come from inside me.

42:31.044 --> 42:38.031
No matter how much attention you're getting,

42:38.500 --> 42:41.926
The novelists are always feeling pitifully neglected.

42:42.106 --> 42:45.452
This is your version of a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde Tech?

42:45.472 --> 42:47.957
Yeah, that's right, and I do that all the time.

42:47.997 --> 42:51.984
So you think that these both are aspects of yourself?

42:52.004 --> 42:56.391
All my novels are Jekyll and Hyde, to divide itself.

42:58.074 --> 43:01.420
Doubles, and secret sharers.

43:02.648 --> 43:08.093
Have you said that to anybody yet?

43:08.113 --> 43:09.734
Not quite that way.

43:10.575 --> 43:14.098
And the very fact that, you know, the boys are twins, I thought.

43:14.179 --> 43:16.921
They're inescapable, you know.

43:16.941 --> 43:20.524
They're born a day apart, Gwyn and Richard a day apart.

43:20.544 --> 43:22.606
They're the same people.

43:22.626 --> 43:23.567
They're cut in two.

43:23.627 --> 43:30.073
It's all been my practice, even now, of immersion and retrospective.

43:31.403 --> 43:35.667
take a little bit of myself and then magnify it and imagine it's all there is.

43:35.767 --> 43:39.411
So the character can be constructed out of time.

43:39.491 --> 43:41.493
I thought as we... Hi, how are you?

43:41.533 --> 43:41.894
How are you?

43:42.554 --> 43:42.694
Good.

43:42.794 --> 43:43.655
What's our time?

43:44.356 --> 43:46.338
Oh, a little more time.

43:46.358 --> 43:46.458
Okay.

43:46.478 --> 43:48.500
I want to shoot a couple of pictures of him outside.

43:48.520 --> 43:48.800
Outside?

43:49.581 --> 43:50.262
Because it's lovely.

43:50.342 --> 43:52.905
It's so nice out there.

43:52.985 --> 43:54.046
How does it look?

43:54.066 --> 43:54.446
Milwaukee.

43:56.188 --> 43:56.388
Very good.

43:56.408 --> 43:59.271
Okay, so we can wrap this up in about five or ten minutes.

43:59.351 --> 44:00.412
And stir up.

44:00.472 --> 44:01.393
Yeah.

44:02.183 --> 44:05.048
Phil, do you want something?

44:05.068 --> 44:05.588
No.

44:05.929 --> 44:06.530
Sure.

44:06.550 --> 44:11.678
I'm drinking a bottle of water and I'm going to float away.

44:11.698 --> 44:14.242
It's a hangover, you know.

44:14.363 --> 44:16.045
Hangover?

44:16.065 --> 44:18.169
What's this thing with Norman Mailer?

44:18.249 --> 44:20.993
Is there something with you with Norman Mailer?

44:21.274 --> 44:23.878
I'm on excellent terms with Mailer.

44:23.898 --> 44:28.225
Now, although there was a time when, it was actually a wonderful story,

44:29.048 --> 44:35.116
He accused Christopher Hitchens, Ian Hamilton, the biographer, and me of being a homosexual mafia.

44:35.397 --> 44:35.937
Don't make me laugh.

44:36.418 --> 44:40.363
There goes the white shirt.

44:40.384 --> 44:43.368
Homosexual mafia controlling the English letter.

44:43.388 --> 44:51.719
Then at the pen party, Christopher Hitchens looked drunkenly around the room on his way out to catch an airplane and saw Mailer in the corner.

44:51.739 --> 44:57.587
So he went lurching and berthing over to Mailer and sort of spun him around and said,

44:58.478 --> 45:03.204
I read that piece where you said that me and Martin Amos and Ian Hamilton were homosexual and that bit.

45:03.224 --> 45:06.208
I just want you to know I think it's funny I started reading Hamilton.

45:07.249 --> 45:11.074
And I went lurching and burping off thinking, that didn't come out at all right.

45:13.797 --> 45:18.603
Do you have a vision of society that you're addressing this problem?

45:19.584 --> 45:22.328
No, it's kind of an anti-vision.

45:22.428 --> 45:27.574
All I'm saying is why is it like this when it could have been

45:28.010 --> 45:30.693
so many other things.

45:31.714 --> 45:32.835
Why this way wrong?

45:33.055 --> 45:38.240
Why have we done it this way wrong?

45:38.260 --> 45:45.808
And how this applies to the male ego and the male set of emotions.

45:46.028 --> 45:55.738
If you'd gone up to a caveman and said, I'm from the future, and what we're going to do is fix things so that men are going to spend 40 years of their lives

45:56.191 --> 45:58.573
sitting in an office trying to do down other men.

46:00.175 --> 46:01.015
How does that sound?

46:01.416 --> 46:09.023
And I'm sure he'd say, find another way, you know, kind of be more firm than that, kind of be more varied than that.

46:09.043 --> 46:20.693
Is it, in fact, endemic among writers to really, the less successful ones, to really resent the success of the... I think so.

46:20.713 --> 46:22.214
I think it's part of the job.

46:22.255 --> 46:25.017
To the point that... Not to that point.

46:25.402 --> 46:34.334
but to even consider... See, now we are really becoming... That is the great element of exaggeration.

46:34.354 --> 46:36.097
That's the kind of satire of it.

46:36.137 --> 46:36.998
That's the satire.

46:37.038 --> 46:39.762
The reification of it.

46:39.782 --> 46:41.524
What if you really did just follow it through?

46:42.526 --> 46:53.080
Instead of nursing this envy and resentment and being silent about it, as all of us are, it's not considered civilized...

46:55.017 --> 46:56.939
Envy is never candid.

46:56.959 --> 46:59.822
Envy never says, I'm envy.

46:59.842 --> 47:01.523
This is what this emotion is, is envy.

47:02.484 --> 47:06.228
It says, I'm high-minded.

47:06.248 --> 47:09.771
Or, I have pure standards for you.

47:09.791 --> 47:11.313
Or, you know, find some other form.

47:12.434 --> 47:14.716
This is what we do with our envy.

47:14.736 --> 47:16.017
We translate it into something else.

47:16.558 --> 47:19.260
Different kinds of aggression.

47:19.280 --> 47:24.045
But if you just come out and say, I am envy,

47:24.481 --> 47:52.902
uh that it gets looked at very differently because i love the fact that that which is reviewing books and uh editing uh yeah and the little magazine and the vanity press he really has the toilet end of the market i think we got plenty of stuff and if you would would you kindly inscribe a book

47:53.506 --> 47:58.774
I got one for my .
