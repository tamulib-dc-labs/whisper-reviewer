WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:03.759
some serious readers out there.

00:03.779 --> 00:04.700
Oh, of course, of course.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.082
But they get older and older.

00:06.802 --> 00:08.604
It's like going to concerts.

00:08.624 --> 00:09.925
I go to a lot of concerts.

00:10.746 --> 00:13.208
And it's amazing how old the audience has become.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.332
You know, there actually are studies.

00:17.993 --> 00:22.397
They've actually done formal studies of the people who attend symphony concerts.

00:23.057 --> 00:27.041
But they also say that they've been looking at this for years, and they always seem to be older people.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.383
Yeah, that may be true.

00:29.403 --> 00:31.185
They were much younger when I was younger.

00:31.604 --> 00:39.861
But I guess, and this is a question I'm sure you're asked often, and it comes to mind.

00:39.881 --> 00:42.647
I was at a talk that Grace Paley gave.

00:43.369 --> 00:50.203
I was at this conference of literary critics and scholars in Boston, which just wrapped up yesterday.

00:50.183 --> 00:54.209
kind of to observe and to hear what the debate is.

00:54.830 --> 01:01.219
But somebody asked Grace Paley, do you have a reader in mind when you're writing?

01:01.760 --> 01:04.705
And she said herself and a few close friends, I guess.

01:05.165 --> 01:11.355
But I wonder how, I mean, you certainly must get a lot of mail from the people who read your books.

01:11.715 --> 01:11.996
Yeah, I do.

01:12.096 --> 01:17.564
And you must have a sense of, if not a visual sense, but you must have an idea of who your audience is.

01:17.604 --> 01:18.385
I really don't.

01:18.365 --> 01:22.391
Because I do write for myself the way Grace does.

01:22.411 --> 01:25.836
And my mail comes from such a disparate audience.

01:26.818 --> 01:33.969
You know, women whose normal reading might be Rosamund Pilcher, is that her name?

01:33.989 --> 01:34.249
Yeah.

01:34.630 --> 01:35.151
Oh, God.

01:35.732 --> 01:39.778
And women who have PhDs and are teaching at one university or another.

01:39.798 --> 01:42.121
And 15-year-old girls.

01:43.023 --> 01:43.163
Really?

01:43.183 --> 01:44.625
And women in their 70s.

01:45.587 --> 01:47.089
I really don't know...

01:47.187 --> 01:48.969
who out there is reading me.

01:51.052 --> 01:55.256
You don't know who's reading you, but do you have a sense, but I think you already answered the question.

01:56.238 --> 01:58.480
So you aren't writing then for a specific reader.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.683
You're writing mainly, you're writing for yourself, I gather.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.064
I'm writing for myself, of course.

02:02.084 --> 02:03.606
You can't really write any other way.

02:03.746 --> 02:08.952
So it's your ear that matters and your sense of humor and your sense of everything, I guess.

02:09.193 --> 02:10.334
Yes.

02:10.354 --> 02:15.400
As to the kind of novel, I guess, that you'd like to read yourself.

02:15.460 --> 02:15.540
Yes.

02:16.938 --> 02:24.066
I remember being heartbroken when I finished writing Our Father because I liked it so much, I wanted to keep writing it.

02:24.086 --> 02:24.426
Really?

02:26.248 --> 02:26.829
How about men?

02:26.849 --> 02:27.550
Do you hear from men?

02:28.150 --> 02:28.571
I do.

02:28.731 --> 02:29.772
The occasional men.

02:29.812 --> 02:31.734
Not as much now as I used to.

02:32.395 --> 02:35.699
And far more for a book like Beyond Power.

02:36.199 --> 02:42.166
In fact, I think probably with Beyond Power, more than 50% of my mail came from men.

02:42.667 --> 02:43.047
Really?

02:43.668 --> 02:46.090
who would be much more likely to pick up a book like that.

02:46.571 --> 02:52.616
But do you find that they say, gee, I expected, I like this, I was led to believe that I wouldn't like it?

02:53.417 --> 03:02.165
I mean, I think that would be, I hope that if men, the men that might have a preconception, you know, going back to the 70s, you know.

03:02.305 --> 03:05.508
I don't know, maybe that might be true with the mail for the women's room.

03:06.689 --> 03:12.915
But most of them said my wife or girlfriend forced me to read this, but, you know, I'm so glad she did, blah-de-blah.

03:13.199 --> 03:14.821
That was the women's room.

03:14.841 --> 03:17.884
They don't write to me about other books that way.

03:18.605 --> 03:24.551
And Beyond Power was clearly their own discovery and their own enlightenment.

03:24.571 --> 03:33.841
And they very often write to offer me their own philosophy in contrast to mine.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.843
But it's usually a friendly letter.

03:35.903 --> 03:38.346
I mean, I don't think I've gotten any nasty letters about it.

03:39.997 --> 04:05.700
um and the work in progress is a as a work of non-fiction kind of a memoir isn't it but you said and uh do you have a title for that that you can tell me so far i'm calling it a season in hell wow and i don't know if that title will last it's pretty good though i mean it's quite powerful i've got plenty of material here we've talked for 45 minutes and uh um

04:06.085 --> 04:10.652
I'll get right on the piece, and I'll certainly make sure that you get copies.

04:10.692 --> 04:12.415
I'll send them to your publicist in New York.

04:13.297 --> 04:15.701
Okay, great.

04:15.841 --> 04:18.064
Do you have an address to send them to?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.907
I can send one directly to you if you'd like.

04:20.128 --> 04:20.909
Yeah, would you please?

04:20.929 --> 04:21.870
I'd be happy to, sure.

04:21.911 --> 04:28.060
Send it to 105 Duane Street.

04:28.081 --> 04:30.304
D-W... D-U-A-N-E.

04:30.324 --> 04:32.127
D-U-A, Duane Street.

04:32.917 --> 04:33.678
New York, New York.

04:34.119 --> 04:34.880
Okay.

04:35.201 --> 04:37.584
I'm sorry, what's this up again?

04:38.165 --> 04:38.225
07.

04:38.245 --> 04:38.706
Okay, great.

04:39.107 --> 04:40.269
And apartment 48B.

04:40.749 --> 04:41.130
Excellent.

04:41.370 --> 04:44.235
Well, this will be along quickly.

04:44.275 --> 04:47.280
I'll get this out within the next two weeks.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.542
I've got next week's piece.

04:49.443 --> 04:51.787
Actually, I'm doing Hirsch's book on the schools we need.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.229
I mean, you know, for next week.

04:54.091 --> 04:54.832
Again, here we are.

04:55.353 --> 04:58.898
It's almost a parallel of what you're saying as far as reading.

04:58.938 --> 05:00.561
I mean, everything is going...

05:01.064 --> 05:02.546
In the wrong direction.

05:02.807 --> 05:07.034
Yeah, it's a terrific furor about the wrong point.

05:07.895 --> 05:08.016
Yeah.

05:09.318 --> 05:11.762
And, well, let's hope we can reverse it.

05:11.782 --> 05:15.829
I've got two daughters who are a couple of years away from going to college, you know.

05:15.909 --> 05:17.231
Well, they're probably readers.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.293
My children are readers.

05:18.313 --> 05:19.194
My children are.

05:19.415 --> 05:23.882
You know, it's all that early training and in a lot of households the TV is on.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.010
12 hours a day, if not more.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.815
Well, there's no TV here at all during the week.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.019
I mean, it's portioned.

05:31.119 --> 05:35.608
And my daughter, my older daughter, actually reads maybe twice as fast as I do.

05:36.610 --> 05:42.782
I can't believe that she reads that quickly, but she's been reading since she was two years old or whatever.

05:43.538 --> 05:44.299
It's just amazing.

05:44.419 --> 05:48.026
It amazes me that there are still people young who enjoy reading.

05:48.226 --> 05:48.707
That's great.

05:49.608 --> 05:51.732
Well, thank you very, very, very much.

05:51.792 --> 05:52.633
I've enjoyed this.

05:52.653 --> 05:52.834
Okay.

05:52.914 --> 05:55.739
And congratulations to you, Nick, for all your successes.

05:55.759 --> 05:56.440
Thank you, Doctor.

05:56.460 --> 06:01.889
And I didn't say it when I began, but let me say I truly enjoyed the book.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.654
And it's wonderful.

06:05.134 --> 06:08.500
And I didn't know anything about these other stories about how

06:09.121 --> 06:15.269
about how it came to be, and I promise you I'll treat it with the proper respect, and I hope you like the piece.

06:16.270 --> 06:16.911
So take care.

06:17.192 --> 06:17.592
Okay.

06:17.632 --> 06:17.933
Thank you.

06:18.213 --> 06:18.854
Bye-bye.

06:23.119 --> 06:23.360
Bye.

06:23.380 --> 06:33.092
Sentinel, it's called The Rest of Us, and it's a column, I don't think it's, it's sort of stands astride op-ed and features.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.597
It's a little more political than a lifestyle column, but it's not really about

06:37.100 --> 06:41.148
you know, Bill Clinton and, you know, his strategy for a second term.

06:41.869 --> 06:46.017
And it's not about how to take coffee stains out of the water.

06:46.037 --> 06:51.207
No, it's not about, like, oh, those darn kids, they say the nuttiest thing, you know.

06:51.228 --> 06:52.730
So some of it is about that.

06:52.751 --> 06:56.337
It always is a little, it has a little more of an edge than that.

06:57.139 --> 06:57.640
And it's,

06:58.126 --> 06:59.127
Syndicated now.

06:59.468 --> 07:00.369
Good.

07:00.409 --> 07:01.090
Who syndicated it?

07:01.190 --> 07:01.751
Tribune Media.

07:02.171 --> 07:02.431
Really?

07:02.612 --> 07:04.034
That's Chicago, right?

07:04.654 --> 07:04.835
Yeah.

07:04.855 --> 07:08.960
The reason I syndicate myself, which is supposed to be impossible.

07:09.280 --> 07:09.440
Wow.

07:10.301 --> 07:11.503
And I've got 22 papers.

07:12.344 --> 07:20.474
In fact, I think I'm talking now to the Wisconsin State Journal, and I'm hopeful they're going to take it.

07:20.555 --> 07:22.497
They took me before, and then...

07:22.882 --> 07:28.407
And then this newspaper or this newsprint fiasco, which really was terrible.

07:28.747 --> 07:28.848
Yeah.

07:28.868 --> 07:30.329
Because I was going gangbusters.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.291
It really has been terrible.

07:32.311 --> 07:34.513
Oh, trying to sell stuff is ridiculous.

07:34.773 --> 07:35.834
I had the hardest time.

07:36.895 --> 07:38.777
They wanted to hire me after.

07:39.077 --> 07:41.039
Can I go off your record for me?

07:41.059 --> 07:41.359
Sure.

07:41.439 --> 07:42.700
I'll just shut up.

07:43.121 --> 07:49.266
One of the reasons they were most suspicious back on the record now is that.

07:49.286 --> 07:50.548
Yeah, I just put the machine on you.

07:51.128 --> 07:51.228
Okay.

07:51.248 --> 07:52.129
Is that...

07:52.480 --> 08:00.855
You know, they said the same thing that my publisher, The Viking, said when my agent turned up with his novel, which is where she's been all her life.

08:01.375 --> 08:01.456
Hmm.

08:01.476 --> 08:01.796
You know?

08:02.237 --> 08:03.559
Isn't that wonderful?

08:04.100 --> 08:06.384
And it is wonderful.

08:06.544 --> 08:14.458
I mean, they said, well, if this is this good, and it is, why didn't the journal do this a long time ago?

08:15.801 --> 08:16.041
Hmm.

08:16.342 --> 08:18.144
So I had to explain that.

08:18.524 --> 08:20.266
Everything is hindsight for these people.

08:20.607 --> 08:22.769
Well, everything is hindsight for everybody.

08:23.009 --> 08:25.592
Why didn't I fall in love with you 20 years ago?

08:25.612 --> 08:28.215
I mean, everything is hindsight for everybody.

08:28.295 --> 08:33.161
I don't mind as long as, you know, all's well that ends.

08:33.301 --> 08:34.202
Now, tell me the story.

08:35.483 --> 08:42.651
I guess you would have been thrilled with a $5,000 advance, and that's kind of... Yeah, Diane, that would have... Are you Jewish?

08:42.671 --> 08:45.234
No, but I appreciate the nuances.

08:45.254 --> 08:46.095
It would have been enough.

08:47.088 --> 08:52.980
And it, yeah, I would have been happy with that.

08:53.635 --> 08:59.261
But the good water faucet apparently was turned on when this book was published.

08:59.301 --> 09:01.263
So what do you think is striking?

09:01.723 --> 09:07.229
What do you think certainly emboldened them to make such a generous offer?

09:07.309 --> 09:10.692
And what do you think they see in the audience?

09:11.573 --> 09:19.761
I guess I'd like to move into the story and I guess who you perceive your audience as as well.

09:20.956 --> 09:26.481
I thought that my audience would be women in their 30s and 40s primarily.

09:27.603 --> 09:35.270
But I've been shocked as I've gone around the country to see how far down and up it reaches and how it crosses genders.

09:35.891 --> 09:38.133
And I guess Viking understood that, but I didn't.

09:41.176 --> 09:48.883
Most women are the writers of most books, or the buyers of most books, most hard-covered books.

09:48.923 --> 09:50.625
We certainly all know that.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.685
I didn't know that, but I'll believe it.

09:54.086 --> 09:58.513
Hardcover fiction is purchased by women.

09:59.234 --> 10:01.677
So certainly it's important to appeal to them.

10:02.719 --> 10:15.057
And I guess that, I don't know, I think it, I guess it ultimately has more to do with the nature of the characters than it does the story itself.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.823
Because I know that when I read

10:19.445 --> 10:22.689
I want to feel... I'm sorry for all the kids in the background.

10:22.869 --> 10:23.490
That's not to worry.

10:25.572 --> 10:34.303
I want to feel some shock of recognition and some weigh-in, a weigh-in.

10:35.685 --> 10:37.787
And that's what they say.

10:39.249 --> 10:39.730
I don't know.

10:39.750 --> 10:44.636
I mean, I really... This whole thing puzzles me beginning to end.

10:44.656 --> 10:46.718
I have to tell you the truth because...

10:47.035 --> 10:56.024
I'm not savvy about trends in publishing and what kinds of books are co-wronged.

10:57.466 --> 11:06.736
And I certainly, I mean, I know that what I asked Jane to try to get me $10,000 so I could take a leave of absence and finish the book.

11:07.737 --> 11:14.764
And I thought that it would be from, you know, running Wolf Press.

11:16.820 --> 11:22.168
I didn't have any idea that this book had this kind of commercial potential.

11:22.188 --> 11:22.449
Really?

11:22.909 --> 11:23.190
No.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.031
Come on.

11:24.932 --> 11:25.493
I'm not.

11:25.513 --> 11:26.375
I mean, come on.

11:26.635 --> 11:29.860
And I haven't finished it, by the way, so don't tell me how it ends.

11:29.940 --> 11:39.314
But I mean, it's certainly a very suspenseful book, and there are themes here that are decidedly mainstream, you know.

11:39.334 --> 11:41.157
Well, I'm a mainstream kind of chick.

11:42.925 --> 11:47.309
I mean, I did not craft this book, and, you know, you can ask my dad.

11:47.469 --> 11:50.372
I mean, I didn't craft this book with the idea.

11:50.652 --> 11:59.361
I mean, it's a performing art, and I certainly want to, and still do want, as many people to read it as is possible.

12:00.542 --> 12:06.707
I mean, I don't believe, I believe that books are meant to be read and not just by an elite few.

12:07.388 --> 12:11.532
I mean, I think that books are stories, and stories are meant to be shared.

12:12.271 --> 12:21.382
And so I wanted a lot of people to read it, but I really didn't craft it thinking that it would have a broad commercial audience.

12:21.402 --> 12:28.591
It was the story that I wanted to tell, and it was the story that I had had a dream about, and there it was.

12:28.631 --> 12:31.054
Now tell me about that, the dream.

12:31.074 --> 12:35.519
I know, that also sounds kind of... New age-ish almost.

12:35.559 --> 12:35.980
Like what?

12:36.220 --> 12:38.022
Like new age stuff almost.

12:38.042 --> 12:40.405
Yeah, and if you knew me, if you were sitting here...

12:40.604 --> 12:44.669
you could not meet anybody who's more once-born than I am.

12:44.809 --> 12:45.210
Okay.

12:47.954 --> 12:54.262
But I had this dream about three and a half years ago, and I really dreamed the whole plot of this novel.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.785
I could tell the people's names and everything else.

12:57.706 --> 13:08.400
And this had happened to me exactly once in my life, so I took it seriously, and I was really beguiled partly by the story and partly by the

13:10.304 --> 13:11.606
What do I want to say?

13:11.626 --> 13:15.070
The issues about memory and identity.

13:15.711 --> 13:19.316
Well, tell me about, pardon me for being so specific here, but tell me about the dream.

13:19.376 --> 13:21.058
I mean, do you remember you woke up?

13:21.158 --> 13:23.301
Were you in a sweat?

13:23.381 --> 13:25.664
Did you realize something extraordinary had happened?

13:26.325 --> 13:30.951
I didn't wake up feeling something extraordinary had happened, but I woke up before dawn and I wrote it down.

13:31.031 --> 13:32.452
Oh, you did write it down.

13:32.513 --> 13:32.813
Yeah, sure.

13:33.594 --> 13:36.337
Because I knew that if I went back to sleep, it would be all over.

13:37.459 --> 13:38.320
And...

13:38.890 --> 13:50.106
I mean, I wrote it down on a notebook next to the bed, and I keep them all over the house, you know, because to write shopping lists and ideas for columns and stuff like that.

13:50.126 --> 13:50.827
I do the same thing.

13:51.247 --> 13:51.528
Yeah.

13:51.668 --> 13:54.151
Well, most people do who do this kind of stuff.

13:54.231 --> 13:56.014
That in itself is not unusual.

13:56.114 --> 14:01.802
But I woke my husband up, and he was mad, you know, that I woke him up.

14:01.822 --> 14:08.391
But he was impressed with the story and the complexity of the story.

14:09.299 --> 14:13.305
And said, like everyone else, well, you should write that down.

14:14.327 --> 14:21.818
But I had, like all of us, no time to do that.

14:22.840 --> 14:27.747
And then he got sick about six months later and died just a few months after that.

14:27.787 --> 14:36.100
And for the next year, my life was consumed by trying to establish some sort of

14:36.552 --> 14:45.262
routine and trying to make decisions about what I would need to do, what kind of compromises I would need to make to raise my children.

14:47.305 --> 14:56.356
And then a friend of mine, a good friend of mine who's a novel writer, encouraged me to try to write this story.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.640
At first she would say, well, can you set aside an hour a day?

14:59.680 --> 15:00.961
Who was the novelist?

15:00.981 --> 15:02.223
Jane Hamilton.

15:04.065 --> 15:05.226
Okay.

15:05.246 --> 15:05.867
And then...

15:06.792 --> 15:09.134
She encouraged me to go away and get a fellowship.

15:10.396 --> 15:19.345
This was as out of character for me as beginning to study classical ballet at the age of 40.

15:19.926 --> 15:23.930
I mean, the idea of me going to an art colony made me laugh like a fool.

15:23.990 --> 15:36.563
You know, I'm a reporter, and I certainly knew that I would be the sparrow among all the peacocks in the art.

15:37.505 --> 15:42.951
And so, but I did do it, and I wrote 70 pages.

15:45.013 --> 15:51.240
And then I sent them to my agent, to whom I had not sent a book in 10 years, though we were good friends.

15:51.981 --> 15:54.163
90% of the deal right there.

15:54.524 --> 15:55.565
You kind of have that agent.

15:55.645 --> 16:00.350
Having her, well, agent in my case should be spelled angel.

16:00.410 --> 16:03.273
I mean, my agent is... Good quote, good quote.

16:03.293 --> 16:04.054
...peerless.

16:04.074 --> 16:05.095
She's peerless.

16:06.477 --> 16:06.837
Um...

16:07.492 --> 16:12.980
She is compassionate and wonderful and tough, and I love her.

16:13.260 --> 16:17.246
But she... She's named in the acknowledgments, I think, right?

16:17.266 --> 16:17.806
Jane Gelfand.

16:17.826 --> 16:17.987
Yeah.

16:19.108 --> 16:26.679
She sent it back for me to double-space it so that it would look longer.

16:26.759 --> 16:29.202
And then a month later, she sold it to the first person.

16:29.242 --> 16:30.023
Not even a month.

16:30.064 --> 16:32.968
A couple of weeks later, she sold it to the first person she showed it to.

16:34.289 --> 16:35.211
That's spectacular.

16:35.451 --> 16:36.132
It's nutty.

16:36.230 --> 16:38.733
And for the numbers that have been reported to.

16:38.753 --> 16:40.074
And for those that are correct, yes.

16:40.395 --> 16:40.495
Yeah.

16:41.015 --> 16:42.097
It's a two-book deal, right?

16:42.117 --> 16:42.757
Two-book deal.

16:43.939 --> 16:44.439
And?

16:44.459 --> 16:47.583
I'm currently working on the second one.

16:47.603 --> 16:49.024
I'm working on it.

16:49.044 --> 16:49.465
Not working.

16:49.485 --> 16:50.066
Well, thinking.

16:50.086 --> 16:54.631
You know, they say a writer is not always writing when he or she is writing.

16:55.352 --> 16:58.035
But I'm writing the second one.

16:58.055 --> 17:00.638
Well, I mean, to go back to the dream, where do you suppose that came from?

17:01.318 --> 17:05.443
I'm sure it came out of the things that devil me most.

17:05.896 --> 17:08.018
as a mother and as a reporter.

17:08.299 --> 17:09.580
What was that verb again?

17:09.660 --> 17:10.441
D-E-V-I-L.

17:10.461 --> 17:11.402
Okay, yeah.

17:12.764 --> 17:19.511
You know, cases of missing children have a peculiar... Is that a verb, by the way, devil?

17:20.132 --> 17:20.692
Devil?

17:20.712 --> 17:21.854
Yeah, okay, go ahead.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.154
Devil me.

17:22.574 --> 17:23.495
Okay.

17:24.537 --> 17:26.859
I don't know if that's a usage that's common.

17:27.139 --> 17:28.701
It's just my... No, no, that's cool.

17:28.721 --> 17:29.342
That's fine.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.925
I'm thinking when I transcribe the tape, that's all.

17:31.965 --> 17:33.607
Go ahead.

17:33.707 --> 17:34.047
That...

17:34.651 --> 17:42.501
they have a particular quality of yearning and haunting that sticks with you as a journalist.

17:42.921 --> 17:53.174
And certainly the cases in Minnesota, like the Jacob Wetterling case and other cases, had stayed with me for a long time as a journalist.

17:53.975 --> 18:01.384
As a mother who had both given birth to children and then adopted children as well,

18:02.123 --> 18:13.134
I often wonder about and turn over in my mind what makes us who we are, whether it's what happens to us or the way that we're born.

18:14.476 --> 18:16.798
And so those ideas were in there.

18:16.838 --> 18:18.800
So, I mean, and also grief.

18:18.900 --> 18:27.589
I mean, clearly when I started to write this book, I was badly grieving for my husband, who'd been sort of the one constant of my adult life.

18:27.609 --> 18:29.211
I mean, we've been together...

18:29.512 --> 18:34.679
married for 13 years, but together for, you know, 16 or 17.

18:35.900 --> 18:46.714
And, you know, I was trying to sort out how I was, what I was going to do with this leftover 40 years or so.

18:46.734 --> 18:47.055
Amazing.

18:47.155 --> 18:57.528
And you talk about grief, and we just see the events of the last couple days, and these people in that town in Pennsylvania, it's just, you know, I've got kids that age.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.130
Yes, a lot.

18:59.195 --> 19:02.761
You know, so the French club is going on a trip.

19:03.001 --> 19:05.806
I mean, God, you know.

19:05.906 --> 19:07.509
Well, and that too.

19:07.689 --> 19:15.923
I mean, one of the things that has always moved me most is that the big things happen in a second.

19:15.963 --> 19:17.366
You don't get to build up to them.

19:17.606 --> 19:18.948
You don't get to go to training.

19:19.629 --> 19:23.616
You know, they happen and then your whole life is before and after.

19:24.170 --> 19:28.237
You know, did you see John Chancellor's obituary a week or so ago?

19:28.257 --> 19:32.664
I saw one of them in Newsweek, but I don't think I know what you're referring to.

19:32.704 --> 19:39.816
Well, there was a final quote, and I've interviewed John Chancellor a couple times and really had the greatest regard for him.

19:39.836 --> 19:41.799
Yeah, very classic guy.

19:41.979 --> 19:45.946
But his final quote was, he said, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

19:46.547 --> 19:46.667
Right.

19:48.335 --> 19:53.022
And he said that while he had cancer, you know, while he was suffering with cancer.

19:53.503 --> 19:54.344
But go ahead, I'm sorry.

19:54.564 --> 19:57.108
That's absolutely the case, isn't it?

19:57.188 --> 19:57.889
That's it.

19:57.909 --> 19:58.810
Go figure.

19:59.351 --> 20:01.654
Try and plot your course for the next 10 years.

20:01.694 --> 20:03.237
Try and plot it for the next two years.

20:04.178 --> 20:04.879
Who knows?

20:04.959 --> 20:12.350
I mean, your life has taken so many... So many, as many twists and downs as that family in the now.

20:12.370 --> 20:12.550
Yeah.

20:13.552 --> 20:14.754
Though of different kinds.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.818
And so I know that...

20:18.440 --> 20:27.336
that you know you have to pick um essentially pick out a couple of true things going back to you know when we talk about

20:28.092 --> 20:55.720
the response of the publisher and and uh and of course advances are just the numbers but in terms of a hundred thousand copies and and with the audience did you see this as an entertainment were you trying to where are you know again you said you didn't have a you didn't perceive it as a commercial work but but you certainly must have had an idea of what you were doing i'm not saying that i didn't want to no i mean i didn't understand the

20:56.172 --> 21:01.499
How big the commercial potential was for it is what I meant.

21:01.519 --> 21:02.941
But I mean in terms of what you were writing.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.584
I wanted it to be an entertainment.

21:04.724 --> 21:08.509
I wanted it to be a great big-shouldered hunk of book.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.313
Brought a little bit of bite to it.

21:11.553 --> 21:11.814
Yeah.

21:12.194 --> 21:21.387
I wanted it to be a book that you could take to a cabin for two days and get lost in.

21:22.058 --> 21:31.070
Those are the kind of books that I grew up liking, you know, big Midwestern novels, you know, Edna Ferber and Wallace Stegner and Jane Smiley and, you know.

21:31.271 --> 21:37.719
You see, and you would consider, if you were to describe yourself, you would describe yourself as a Midwestern writer?

21:38.100 --> 21:38.541
Oh, sure.

21:38.601 --> 21:39.001
That's great.

21:39.942 --> 21:46.131
I do have some Midwestern newspapers, by the way, so why don't you give me a little bit of your biography here?

21:46.411 --> 21:49.095
Well, I come from the west side of Chicago.

21:49.784 --> 22:01.436
and grew up there in the Italians and Irish neighborhoods, and grew up very much in the rhythms of that part of the country.

22:01.476 --> 22:19.234
Now I live in Wisconsin, which is in its own way a very different kind of Midwestern experience, but still has the same kind of boldness and also a certain lack of cynicism.

22:20.058 --> 22:23.082
That, to me, distinguishes this part of the country.

22:24.063 --> 22:25.124
And how about schooling?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.126
Where did you go to schools?

22:26.426 --> 22:28.148
I went to school at the University of Illinois.

22:28.489 --> 22:28.829
I see.

22:28.849 --> 22:34.376
And may as well just do the biographical stuff quickly.

22:34.456 --> 22:40.704
And you've been a journalist for... I've been a journalist, oh boy, for 21 years.

22:41.105 --> 22:41.365
Really?

22:41.946 --> 22:42.847
In the Midwest?

22:42.867 --> 22:44.029
43 years old.

22:44.049 --> 22:44.409
Uh-huh.

22:44.429 --> 22:48.815
And I have five children ranging in age from seven months to 21 years.

22:48.895 --> 22:49.035
Uh-huh.

22:50.517 --> 22:52.341
God bless you.

22:55.989 --> 22:56.229
Thank you.

22:56.570 --> 23:01.961
I'm sorry, I interrupted the flow there, but that is stuff that I... That's all right.

23:02.422 --> 23:05.168
But I wanted... I mean, I'm not saying that I...

23:05.367 --> 23:07.270
I'm not saying I am in their tradition.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.091
Don't get me wrong.

23:08.151 --> 23:08.892
I mean, I'm not.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.655
Well, it's what you aspire to, certainly.

23:11.657 --> 23:11.937
Oh, certainly.

23:11.957 --> 23:16.183
If I were to ask you who your models were, you'd probably name the authors you just named, you know?

23:16.224 --> 23:18.207
Yeah, those are my role models.

23:18.227 --> 23:18.427
Sure.

23:18.447 --> 23:22.213
I would love to stand in the same federal building with them.

23:22.233 --> 23:26.499
Yeah, I'm not saying that I'm David McCullough, but I sure as hell would like to write like him, you know.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.565
And, you know, that's the kind of work you try and do.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.670
So that's, I respect that.

23:34.223 --> 23:37.007
And so what do you think the next novel is going to do?

23:37.047 --> 23:39.851
Well, I already know because I dream about it.

23:39.871 --> 23:41.453
Another dream, huh?

23:44.036 --> 23:46.380
Tell me what kind of sleeping pills you've been taking.

23:46.400 --> 23:46.900
I swear to God.

23:47.041 --> 23:49.784
I mean, you know, more people, more of my friends have said that to me.

23:49.864 --> 23:56.133
I mean, they just, you know, if they didn't know me so well, they'd think I was making it up.

23:56.253 --> 23:59.938
But I had this dream about six, you know, about three weeks ago.

24:00.078 --> 24:01.120
Oh, great.

24:01.160 --> 24:01.260
Yeah.

24:01.780 --> 24:08.108
I mean, I was doing a lot of sleeping, let me tell you.

24:08.248 --> 24:28.193
But it's about a young woman, very young woman, you know, like a 15-year-old and her relationship with an older woman who's a lawyer that centers on a predicament that the young girl gets into, which sort of amounts to being

24:28.409 --> 24:32.014
Not just like the bad date, but like the bad date from the moon.

24:33.216 --> 24:40.387
The worst possible, it's not incest or abuse or anything like that, but the worst possible consuming kind of relationship.

24:41.849 --> 24:55.530
And how an older woman in her life helps her outgrow it, though not without enormous regrets.

24:56.253 --> 24:59.757
From these two dreams, did you have the titles as well?

24:59.997 --> 25:00.297
Yeah.

25:00.658 --> 25:00.978
Really?

25:01.499 --> 25:01.699
Uh-huh.

25:02.620 --> 25:06.264
Not for the—the first one had a really mutt title.

25:06.284 --> 25:16.896
You know, I did dream the title, and it was at the time of the reunion, which I intended to mean—well, it's obvious, but it was a crummy title.

25:17.056 --> 25:19.358
And then my little boy thought up the deep end of the ocean.

25:19.499 --> 25:20.740
Really?

25:20.760 --> 25:20.860
Yeah.

25:21.262 --> 25:22.283
then five-year-old.

25:22.303 --> 25:23.384
Isn't that great?

25:23.404 --> 25:23.744
Yeah.

25:23.764 --> 25:24.405
Great title.

25:24.805 --> 25:25.065
Yeah.

25:25.085 --> 25:28.568
I claim no credit for it, but he thought it up.

25:29.389 --> 25:32.471
This other one, the title in the dream was actually better.

25:34.093 --> 25:38.176
And how about the characters and the characters' names and their voices, all this you've heard?

25:39.017 --> 25:39.157
Uh-huh.

25:41.559 --> 25:42.019
No kidding.

25:44.782 --> 25:49.966
But if I ever, it must be, I think it must be that vitamin, you know, that vitamin now, melanin.

25:49.986 --> 25:50.226
Oh, why not?

25:50.266 --> 25:50.827
Sure.

25:50.847 --> 25:51.167
It must be it.

25:51.772 --> 25:54.797
Now, is your background Italian-American?

25:54.817 --> 25:57.321
No, I was, my married name is Allegretti.

25:57.722 --> 25:58.504
I see.

25:58.524 --> 25:59.666
My husband was Italian.

26:00.146 --> 26:00.407
Okay.

26:00.988 --> 26:04.394
And I grew up... Wait, is Misha a French?

26:05.195 --> 26:05.936
Is that a French name?

26:05.996 --> 26:06.637
It's Canadian.

26:06.657 --> 26:07.078
Canadian?

26:07.279 --> 26:07.779
Canadian.

26:07.799 --> 26:08.160
Okay.

26:10.199 --> 26:12.623
And just looking at Beth Cappadora, that's all.

26:12.643 --> 26:15.106
That's why I'm... Yeah, that means hat of gold.

26:15.927 --> 26:16.428
There you go.

26:16.688 --> 26:17.069
Excellent.

26:18.231 --> 26:20.494
I think I've got plenty of stuff here.

26:21.575 --> 26:22.897
You're very nice to do this.

26:22.917 --> 26:23.238
I appreciate it.

26:23.258 --> 26:23.739
Well, thanks.

26:25.321 --> 26:32.672
We did just put this together yesterday, so normally I'm a lot better prepared than I am right now.

26:32.692 --> 26:37.118
And I assure you the book will be thoroughly read before I...

26:37.739 --> 26:39.842
I'll take it with me down the Cape this weekend.

26:40.283 --> 26:41.465
That's the place to do it.

26:41.786 --> 26:42.507
Yeah, well, I'll do it.

26:42.647 --> 26:46.874
A buddy of mine lives out on the Cape, a close friend of mine.

26:46.894 --> 26:47.254
Who's that?

26:47.535 --> 26:48.156
Anne LeClaire.

26:48.757 --> 26:49.638
I don't know her.

26:49.979 --> 26:51.341
No, but I know her work.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.565
I don't know her, but I'm certainly familiar with her work.

26:55.307 --> 26:58.853
So I'm going to New York next week to interview Mario Puzo.

27:01.313 --> 27:03.196
It's a kind of new book, The Last Dawn.

27:03.336 --> 27:04.638
I've heard about this.

27:04.658 --> 27:05.439
And it's not bad.

27:05.659 --> 27:08.963
I always thought he was a pretty good writer, actually.

27:08.983 --> 27:09.805
This book is good.

27:09.845 --> 27:16.333
I mean, I thought he had a couple of flops after The Godfather, but hey, 76, you know, give me a break.

27:16.934 --> 27:19.378
Well, like my father says, if you're not gigging, you're dying.

27:19.778 --> 27:20.219
There you go.

27:20.259 --> 27:22.001
So I'll be doing that.

27:22.081 --> 27:26.768
And I hope at some point you'll be reading my stuff in the Madison paper.

27:26.788 --> 27:30.593
It sounds pretty good, but you never know it until you know it, you know.

27:30.613 --> 27:30.713
Yeah.

27:31.115 --> 27:35.625
Well, you know, good luck to you.

27:35.845 --> 27:36.306
Thanks.

27:36.326 --> 27:39.052
And if you need anything from this part of the country, you know, I'm here.

27:39.252 --> 27:39.733
Terrific.

27:39.754 --> 27:45.766
And I'll make sure Chair Sheets gets to Rachel, and I'm sure she'll pass them on to you.

27:45.786 --> 27:45.987
All right.

27:46.368 --> 27:47.129
Thanks a lot.

27:47.149 --> 27:47.490
Take care.

27:47.510 --> 27:48.372
Good luck to you.

27:48.492 --> 27:48.572
Bye.

27:48.592 --> 27:48.853
Bye-bye.
