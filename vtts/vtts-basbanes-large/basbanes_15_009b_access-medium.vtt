00:02.309 --> 00:10.780
I can sip on a coffee.

00:10.800 --> 00:30.645
Well, I think the question that... Okay, to go back a couple of steps, when I think of who I write for, or for whom I write,

00:30.625 --> 00:41.635
I say nowadays, I write for myself.

00:41.655 --> 00:49.523
But when I say myself, I don't mean a narrow sense of self.

00:49.543 --> 00:53.707
An African-American male, born in 1941, grew up in Pittsburgh.

00:53.727 --> 00:57.751
I mean that part of me, but I also mean the guy who studied 18th century literature.

00:57.771 --> 00:58.472
The guy who read Faulkner, G.S.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.012
Eliot, and Virginia Woolf.

00:58.992 --> 01:11.250
The guy who played basketball, the guy who grew up in home work, mostly in an all-black neighborhood, the guy who lived in Spain.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.073
There were no black people around.

01:13.285 --> 01:26.919
When I think of who I am, I think of the fact that it's very, very important to me that my mother and my aunts could read my books.

01:26.939 --> 01:38.972
They don't read literary fiction, but I want them to be able, or they don't read much of it, but they're intelligent women, and they are good readers, and I want them to be able to enjoy the books, maybe not all the books, maybe not every aspect of the book,

01:40.488 --> 01:43.173
I include them when I say me.

01:43.333 --> 01:47.020
So it's like the multifaceted me.

01:47.120 --> 01:56.597
It's the me that Whitman talks about when he, you know, I sing America.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.480
So that's my life, it's me.

01:59.067 --> 02:13.236
and all the facets and elements that go into the material.

02:13.256 --> 02:13.437
Yes, yes.

02:13.457 --> 02:15.000
You mentioned, or of course the region that you left is quite about, that is,

02:14.980 --> 02:37.110
It's a homework that for me, I want to keep expanding.

02:37.130 --> 02:38.592
I don't want the boundaries to be physical.

02:38.858 --> 02:43.447
I want to suggest that the boundaries of Homewood are infinite.

02:43.468 --> 02:51.484
That you can begin to tell stories or write stories about Homewood and find yourself in ancient roots or find yourself

02:53.118 --> 03:08.840
or find yourself on the moon, that any community is an imaginative enterprise as well as an enterprise of bricks and boards and material stuff and who does what kind of job and how much money people make.

03:08.860 --> 03:17.151
The core of my community is immaterial and it has to do with the core of Homewood, as I see it, is immaterial.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.075
Non-material.

03:19.455 --> 03:25.687
And it has to do with the songs, it has to do with the dances, it has to do with the preachers and the way they prayed.

03:26.369 --> 03:38.211
It has to do with the incredible networks of women who take care of the children, as well as drugs, disease, and AIDS, and violence.

03:38.191 --> 03:55.693
But it's a community of the imagination that the people I know very well transferred to me, made me aware of by the stories that they're told.

03:57.344 --> 04:03.174
the ways they acted.

04:03.855 --> 04:20.163
I used to think that stories were basically finger exercises in getting you ready for the longer stuff.

04:20.183 --> 04:23.368
But since I've tried to write volumes of stories,

04:24.445 --> 04:33.753
It's a collective volume of stories.

04:33.954 --> 04:39.639
I have more respect for the form.

04:39.659 --> 04:49.808
I see them as very different, demanding different things of the writer, affecting a kind of different relationship with the reader, and maybe equally as hard.

04:49.908 --> 04:51.870
My preference still is the novel.

04:51.850 --> 04:55.463
Maybe because you can make more mistakes in a novel.

04:55.523 --> 05:00.039
Or the mistakes make it more interesting.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.066
The mistakes make it more interesting.

05:02.287 --> 05:03.953
It's just like you can watch...

05:06.110 --> 05:11.337
Go watch a college game, and the level of skill is nowhere near that as pro.

05:11.778 --> 05:16.624
But yet the college game is more interesting sometimes, just because they screw up.

05:16.744 --> 05:17.906
It's unpredictable.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.529
When did you run your school?

05:20.629 --> 05:25.536
Penn, University of Pennsylvania.

05:26.140 --> 05:28.603
But we could play with anybody.

05:28.623 --> 05:37.412
I mean, no, we couldn't play with anybody.

05:37.472 --> 05:43.098
We almost could play with anybody.

05:43.118 --> 05:44.239
We weren't big enough to play with the really best team.

05:44.259 --> 05:47.703
We'd give them a battle for three quarters, and they'd wear us down the best way.

05:47.723 --> 05:48.103
Country-wide, yeah.

05:48.123 --> 05:52.448
We won the Big Five one year while I was there, and that includes Temple and St.

05:52.468 --> 05:52.788
Joe and LaSalle.

05:52.808 --> 05:53.329
And they were...

05:53.866 --> 06:09.825
At least one or two of those teams was ranked in the top ten.

06:09.845 --> 06:11.887
We're talking also back in the dark ages.

06:11.907 --> 06:12.348
They were even better.

06:12.368 --> 06:16.753
More All-Americans, more ranked teams.

06:16.773 --> 06:17.834
Oh, no, this is basketball.

06:17.854 --> 06:19.196
You told me you played football.

06:19.216 --> 06:21.679
No, football was my favorite for a while in high school.

06:21.659 --> 06:37.834
Of course, the Penn teams were wonderful.

06:37.854 --> 06:40.380
And then I coached with the teams that went to the final four or five teams.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.963
I mentioned it earlier, but I didn't play football in college at all.

06:41.943 --> 06:46.417
I never finished the high school season in football.

06:46.518 --> 06:49.086
I always got hurt one way or another.

06:49.166 --> 06:55.446
And then I figured maybe somebody's trying to tell me.
