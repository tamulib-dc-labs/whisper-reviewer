WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:03.956
There it is.

00:05.658 --> 00:07.300
I'd just like to see the first one stuck.

00:07.340 --> 00:07.701
There it is.

00:07.761 --> 00:08.502
Okay, number one.

00:09.162 --> 00:14.209
Okay, well, if you don't mind, I would just like to have a general conversation.

00:14.529 --> 00:14.810
Sure.

00:15.431 --> 00:24.863
And at some point, after I really get immersed in what's going on, maybe we can get together for some more specific... Sure, absolutely.

00:24.903 --> 00:29.268
Because right now, I'm just totally feeling my way into this.

00:30.370 --> 00:30.510
Uh-huh.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.669
And I guess the idea of writing a history, a centennial history of a university press, you know.

00:36.689 --> 00:55.015
One thing I did say this morning, which I found very useful, was that he thought that a press could be defined by the tenures of its directors, that each director probably leaves a certain kind of a stamp on it, which opened it there.

00:55.035 --> 00:56.177
Do you agree with that, do you think?

00:57.001 --> 01:06.914
I think that's true in the case of this press, because the tenures have been so long, and they've covered significant periods.

01:08.336 --> 01:14.584
It's basically three people in a hundred years.

01:17.367 --> 01:18.068
Well, there you go.

01:18.248 --> 01:20.752
Do you think this is an interesting way to approach it?

01:20.772 --> 01:23.295
Yeah, I really do.

01:25.739 --> 01:39.213
And I think, to a considerable extent, that they also mark different eras in publishing and the life of the university and the way books are published and so on.

01:39.434 --> 01:54.970
Especially if you consider Chester Kerr's tenure to date from before he became director.

01:55.321 --> 02:12.979
the key player at the press even before that, so he gets up to whatever it is, you know, thirty-something years, and his is, I think, a pivotal tenure.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.625
Do you think he regarded it as his little fiefdom?

02:16.027 --> 02:17.649
Oh, absolutely.

02:18.190 --> 02:18.731
Absolutely.

02:18.851 --> 02:19.872
Le Prêt c'est moi.

02:19.892 --> 02:21.715
I mean, there was no question about that.

02:22.336 --> 02:22.716
Yeah.

02:22.897 --> 02:25.640
I said, you know, this is pretty interesting.

02:25.941 --> 02:27.923
He said, I'm quoting him.

02:27.944 --> 02:29.305
He said, well, he's very full of himself.

02:29.325 --> 02:30.207
He had a lot of style.

02:30.747 --> 02:33.651
Yeah, he was... You're true of quoting Morgan?

02:33.671 --> 02:34.753
Quoting him directly, yeah.

02:34.853 --> 02:34.993
Okay.

02:35.013 --> 02:36.956
Well, I mean, you could have been quoting a lot of people, but yeah.

02:37.076 --> 02:41.683
Well, he was too egocentric to make the most of the press in his view.

02:41.743 --> 02:45.628
I'm not asking you to say yes or no on that, but...

02:46.418 --> 02:55.182
He gave you a little instance of the Franklin papers, and I'll have to listen to the Ted to get the precise name, but an individual who was working on a blog.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.087
He wanted to bring him in on the board.

02:57.286 --> 02:57.907
And he said, why?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.429
He said, that's like bringing in the hired help.

02:59.449 --> 03:01.692
He said, it is bringing in.

03:01.712 --> 03:02.634
It's difficult.

03:02.654 --> 03:03.575
It is bringing in.

03:03.695 --> 03:04.256
Don't quote me on that.

03:04.376 --> 03:05.858
Don't quote me on that.

03:05.878 --> 03:07.741
I said, sure, don't worry about it.

03:07.841 --> 03:09.163
I'm not here to.

03:09.283 --> 03:11.105
This is a celebration of the press.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.347
Right, right, right.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.609
But it is interesting.

03:13.649 --> 03:17.615
I think it would behoove me to get a sense of the character.

03:18.035 --> 03:19.878
Well, I mean, he was a huge personality.

03:20.378 --> 03:22.922
And you might have seen his...

03:23.476 --> 03:30.462
picture at the press, and there he is with his guardsman's moustache and so on, and his tremendous, actually really tremendous presence.

03:31.904 --> 03:33.365
Ed's right, enormous ego.

03:34.126 --> 03:39.671
And I think probably did, to some extent, get in the way of making even more of it.

03:41.152 --> 03:44.235
He was a brilliant promoter.

03:44.255 --> 03:44.916
That's important.

03:45.856 --> 03:45.956
Yeah.

03:46.297 --> 03:49.239
And he was, I've got a few footsteps there.

03:49.259 --> 03:52.082
I'm starting out with sort of a negative.

03:52.636 --> 03:59.345
You know, you follow somebody who's been there for 25 or 30 years, and then you spend another 25 years.

04:00.286 --> 04:01.167
You know that.

04:01.548 --> 04:03.190
You know a lot of that person.

04:03.691 --> 04:08.557
And the promotion, he was promoting himself as much as the press at any one time.

04:08.758 --> 04:13.564
And sometimes it was great for the press, and sometimes I think it got in the way.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.487
Was the press at that point, do you think, an instrument of the university, or was it that?

04:19.507 --> 04:20.288
No, it was not.

04:20.609 --> 04:38.573
And I think the most important, probably the most important thing he did was, the press at that time was an instrument of its, or had been an instrument of its founder, George Day, and it was not part of the university.

04:39.114 --> 04:40.716
It was a separate

04:41.978 --> 04:51.987
wholly owned corporation that had various links to Yale, but in fact was not a part of the Yale corporation at the university's technical name.

04:52.027 --> 04:53.588
Well, it started out that way.

04:53.608 --> 04:56.351
How did Yale allow its name to be used for private enterprise?

04:56.371 --> 05:00.855
Well, the days were Yale graduates.

05:00.915 --> 05:03.617
They were well-heeled.

05:03.637 --> 05:09.943
They were doing a good thing, and he set it up that way, and within a year of

05:10.345 --> 05:20.158
his setting up the press, he came to Yale to be treasurer of the university, and I think probably nobody just noticed very much or minded that it was set up as a private corporation.

05:21.099 --> 05:25.225
He raised a lot of money for Yale, and he raised a fair amount of money for the press at the same time.

05:25.986 --> 05:30.572
They tell me he spent mornings in the treasurer's office and afternoons at the press.

05:30.612 --> 05:39.964
And for all of those years then, from 1908 on, and

05:40.315 --> 05:44.899
through the early post-war years, it remained a private corporation.

05:44.919 --> 05:55.469
Now, there were always Yale people on the board and so on, but it had its considerable institutional independence.

05:56.690 --> 06:10.002
And in the, you know, Chester had once planned to write about this, and he never did, but, and I don't know if there's maybe anyone left alive who could tell the whole story, but

06:10.758 --> 06:22.470
Um, the man in charge of the press was a rather weak, um, director, um, prior to Chester.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.891
Prior to Chester.

06:24.912 --> 06:39.246
And the actual control of the press, I'm talking about the sort of early 50s now, I think in 48 or 49, and there had been a fellow there, um, who was called the editor.

06:40.272 --> 06:45.798
And he was the strongest person at the press.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.844
It'll come to me.

06:51.024 --> 07:03.158
And Chester had come to the press after writing

07:04.454 --> 07:06.035
Go ahead, I'm just checking.

07:06.155 --> 07:34.140
After writing a book, which was a sort of survey of American University presses, the first thing he did after the war, I guess, and this guy was really pretty much calling the shots and saying what was to be published and so on, and he was a very, very early, well, what was later called a neoconservative, taking the press in a considerable direction to the right,

07:34.897 --> 07:46.110
At one point, he had set up a series of books that were underwritten by one of the giant oil companies.

07:46.150 --> 07:47.492
Really?

07:47.732 --> 07:47.832
Yeah.

07:47.852 --> 07:51.357
What were those books about?

07:51.397 --> 07:54.761
No, I can't, because I think— Were they political type things?

07:54.821 --> 07:58.525
Yeah, they were political, yeah.

08:01.255 --> 08:28.022
a group within the faculty much aware of this and wanted to do something about it, wanted to take the control away from this person and move the press editorially in a different direction, and also to bring it into the orbit, as they like to say, of the university.

08:28.660 --> 08:45.114
And the man who was critical in there was a member of the history department who later became the president of the university, and Whitney Griswold.

08:46.095 --> 08:55.523
And the struggle for the sort of heart and soul of the press went on through the 50s.

08:55.663 --> 08:58.566
And at that time, in addition to the director of the press, there was this

08:58.900 --> 09:12.693
editor, and that was his title, I believe, and Chester Kerr was there and he had a title that was something like secretary, in which he acted more like a kind of grand vizier to the sultan.

09:13.894 --> 09:28.468
And he pretty much engineered or orchestrated the connection with Yale, and when it came down to it,

09:28.972 --> 09:40.703
This other guy left, the director retired, Chester became the head of the press, and at just about the same moment,

09:41.172 --> 09:44.197
the press became a part of the university.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.341
And there was one other thing driving it at the time.

09:46.381 --> 09:47.844
And this was in the fifties?

09:47.924 --> 09:54.996
And by that, it was the late fifties, but when it finally happened... So really, it was a private entity for... It was a private entity for... Yeah, that's right.

09:55.016 --> 10:01.628
The other thing that was pushing it into the university's orbit was that the city of New Haven

10:01.608 --> 10:08.739
was trying to tax the press, and so it also had the shelter that it wanted.

10:09.239 --> 10:24.522
But I think that was the most important thing that happened then, and it, Chester brought it into the orbit of the university, and he made it, after that, a professional operation, and it hadn't been.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.446
So you'd describe it, perhaps, as an amateur operation?

10:27.506 --> 10:28.528
Yeah, I really would.

10:28.568 --> 10:29.910
A clubby kind of thing?

10:30.262 --> 10:39.390
It was, it was, the whole thing was run for most of those years by, uh, this, uh, good old boy who was the treasurer of the university.

10:39.410 --> 10:40.871
Now we can't remember his name off.

10:40.891 --> 10:41.172
Yeah.

10:41.192 --> 10:44.314
Well, no, George Parmley Day was the guy who ran it, but, but the, uh, George, right?

10:44.515 --> 10:48.438
George Parmley Day, D-A-Y, was the man who founded the press.

10:48.458 --> 10:49.379
Parmley, P-A-R-M-L-Y.

10:49.459 --> 10:50.260
P-A-R-M-L-Y.

10:50.900 --> 10:56.425
Yale, class of, I believe, 97, and he was the brother of Clarence Day.

10:58.146 --> 10:58.767
And, uh,

11:00.316 --> 11:20.198
George took a job on Wall Street working for his father, who, if you remember the book or the play, was the governor of the New York Stock Exchange, and they started the press, and George and his wife, and Clarence, the three of them working together, just started it in a little room.

11:21.241 --> 11:27.790
Eventually, within maybe a year or two, George was asked to come to Yale to be treasurer, and he brought the whole thing.

11:27.810 --> 11:28.691
I see.

11:28.711 --> 11:31.495
What did they do, just a few titles to begin with?

11:32.195 --> 11:34.739
Yeah.

11:35.820 --> 11:41.608
They probably did eight or ten titles even that first year.

11:42.589 --> 11:45.893
And some of what they published was extremely good.

11:46.314 --> 11:49.358
You're just anticipating my question.

11:50.283 --> 11:51.445
But there's something you should do.

11:51.485 --> 12:01.598
Next time you're at the press and you carve out an hour or more, you can walk the history of the press on the shelves of the library.

12:02.399 --> 12:05.122
The books are actually shelved by publication date.

12:05.222 --> 12:06.884
That might even be a good opening scene.

12:06.904 --> 12:07.866
Yeah, it might indeed.

12:08.346 --> 12:18.940
And you, if you, you know, start over on the far left and there it will say that first year and there are the books.

12:19.291 --> 12:41.219
that were published, and actually you'll find on a shelf above them a number of titles that were published with the name Yale University Press on them before there was a press, and they were published in honor of the time of the university's centennial, just a few years before that.

12:41.699 --> 12:44.283
So the name was on there.

12:44.343 --> 12:47.627
But there they are, and you can look at

12:48.147 --> 12:51.451
1908, 1909, and so on, and just follow it right on through.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.678
So what's the oldest university press in North America, would you say?

12:56.718 --> 12:59.442
Harvard, I would imagine, or Hopkins?

12:59.743 --> 12:59.843
No.

12:59.923 --> 13:00.904
Johns Hopkins is.

13:01.986 --> 13:07.373
And it goes well back to the 80s, I guess.

13:09.796 --> 13:11.939
So it's a fairly recent phenomenon here, isn't it?

13:11.959 --> 13:15.684
Yes, it is.

13:15.704 --> 13:18.087
Harvard claims to have had a small press

13:18.742 --> 13:28.574
which was really a printing press that Henry Dunster, one of the early presidents of Harvard, had in the 17th century, but it didn't last very long.

13:28.594 --> 13:31.477
The last few days press, I mean, the sound book, I suppose, was then.

13:31.497 --> 13:33.039
Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.480
Back in 1638 or whatever.

13:34.500 --> 13:42.069
Yeah, and Cornell had a press in the 1860s, but it folded, and they didn't start up a new one for a generation or more.

13:42.109 --> 13:44.773
Well, Cambridge had 500 years.

13:44.793 --> 13:46.274
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

13:46.294 --> 13:47.736
So it was very new.

13:47.969 --> 14:14.500
And it pretty much dates from the presses, the university press movement, pretty much dates from the sort of professionalization of scholarship in this country, the sort of first generation of scholars, most of whom were German-trained or were trained on the model of German universities.

14:15.577 --> 14:19.120
Daniel Coit Gilman of Johns Hopkins was a leader in this.

14:19.641 --> 14:38.337
And the presses were started, in fact, to provide a publishing outlet for these new professional scholars who were not historians like Parkman and Prescott who were writing for a broad general audience, but for writing more for their own colleagues and so on.

14:38.577 --> 14:45.583
And by the 90s, some of the presses that are still great today were

14:45.800 --> 14:51.007
were founded, Chicago, California, Columbia, and so on.

14:52.248 --> 14:58.657
And a lot of them, in a number of cases, the disciplines grew up around the presses.

14:59.498 --> 15:05.666
That's particularly true of the University of Chicago, where they started a press that had a journals and a book publishing division.

15:05.726 --> 15:14.878
And William Rainey Harper brought people in, and he said, oh, I want you to do philology.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.857
What's philology?

15:17.077 --> 15:25.988
Well, Ed this morning, I asked him, I said, do you think that the press generally, vaguely, kind of followed the curriculum in a way?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.330
And he said, no, he didn't think so.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.512
But you would say differently.

15:29.532 --> 15:33.317
I'm speaking historically, and it's true.

15:33.778 --> 15:44.511
I think what's, in more recent years, the university presses have published

15:44.828 --> 15:57.429
Largely in, with a few exceptions, largely in areas where what's written is published in book form rather than in journal form.

15:57.589 --> 16:09.790
So the enormous growth of the natural and physical sciences created a whole

16:10.580 --> 16:20.752
industry of publishing grew up around that, and the university presses don't do that, but they stayed largely in the humanities and the sort of softer of the social sciences.

16:20.972 --> 16:34.849
And another thing that he told me today, which surprised me too, I didn't realize it, I would have thought that one of the functions of the Yale University Press or Harvard University Press or Princeton, any of these other major academic presses is to

16:35.099 --> 16:37.723
publish the product of research of your faculty.

16:38.424 --> 16:39.847
And he said, no.

16:40.147 --> 16:46.237
And in fact, it's probably tougher for a Yale faculty member to publish with the press.

16:46.378 --> 16:47.620
To a considerable extent.

16:48.301 --> 16:58.778
Not that it is tougher, but you actually really wanted the balance, and you were looking for important work, number one, not necessarily an outlet for your faculty.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.665
And maybe you could talk a little bit about that and how that is.

17:02.845 --> 17:04.427
Well, okay.

17:05.128 --> 17:23.830
History is an example, I think, of a kind of a field where the leading figures in the field, and Morgan would be a perfect example, but you could name a dozen other just at Yale, who could publish anywhere?

17:24.010 --> 17:25.953
In fact, in his case, do.

17:25.973 --> 17:26.854
And do, yeah.

17:27.114 --> 17:27.735
Do, yeah.

17:28.829 --> 17:32.398
Peter Gay, or C. Van Woodward, or... Jonathan Spence.

17:32.418 --> 17:33.841
Jonathan Spence, or all around, yeah.

17:34.062 --> 17:34.623
Harold Bloom.

17:34.643 --> 17:37.992
Yeah, I mean, the list is enormous, and so they can go anywhere.

17:38.192 --> 17:46.753
The press at Yale competes to publish their work, and...

17:47.206 --> 17:52.191
One of the things I did when I came was try to recapture some of them.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.554
So you made that a project?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.476
I did, yeah.

17:56.796 --> 18:00.861
Well, it was, at that time, surely the greatest history department in the country.

18:01.241 --> 18:06.707
And we got some of them.

18:06.887 --> 18:10.792
Give me some of your favorite victories, your favorite triumphs there.

18:11.793 --> 18:16.538
Well, I suppose the first and most important one that I landed was Jerry Pelican.

18:17.530 --> 18:22.715
And I had known him somewhat when I was at the University of Chicago.

18:23.176 --> 18:37.391
And he had been there before coming to Yale, and I think almost certainly his most important book, his five-volume, History of Christian Thought, was published by the University of Chicago.

18:37.771 --> 18:44.398
But I got...

18:45.948 --> 19:05.038
got him back to the list, and he could probably have gone other places, but this also happened at a time when trade publishing was changing.

19:05.058 --> 19:13.812
And Jerry had been published most recently by Harper and Rowe, and his very, he was

19:14.416 --> 19:43.410
close to one man there, a man named Melvin Arnold, who was the, um, he started as an editor, actually, at Beacon Press in Boston, and then went to Harper, and, um, he, he was Hugh's mentor, um, and he started the, uh, Harper Torch List, which for many years was that really fine paperback imprint, and, uh, he went on up, up through the ranks, and, and, um,

19:44.791 --> 20:05.162
for a brief period of time, was president of the company, and Jerry told me once, he said, Mel said to him, I want to publish everything you write, every kind of book you write, whatever it is, we'll, you know, we'll do it, because it's first-rate stuff, and Harper's had always had a strong religion and history list, and so on, and so it was going to fit.

20:05.262 --> 20:11.271
Well, it didn't happen, and

20:12.500 --> 20:37.705
the company was, like, first became Harper and Roe, bringing and buying the educational part, and like all of these companies, it was struggling to compete in a changing world and in a world where book companies were becoming larger and larger and needed more money to be effective and competing and so on.

20:37.925 --> 20:41.629
And Harper was unable or unwilling to

20:41.812 --> 20:49.020
find room on their list for a pelican.

20:49.040 --> 20:54.066
He was briefly sort of the academic advisor to the entire house.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.048
Yeah.

20:55.368 --> 20:56.770
That's actually where I got to know him.

20:56.810 --> 21:03.337
I was the history editor there for a while, and shortly after Mel Arnold left, a wonderful man named Winn Knowlton came in.

21:03.357 --> 21:05.460
He was a financial guy.

21:06.020 --> 21:10.806
He wanted to do things right, and he asked Jerry to come, and he said, why don't you

21:12.524 --> 21:14.787
do something with the editors of the press.

21:15.168 --> 21:19.174
And Jerry said, well, I'm giving a seminar at Yale on Gibbon.

21:19.935 --> 21:22.359
How about if I gave it for the editors?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.563
And so, okay.

21:25.583 --> 21:37.481
So I joined the seminar, and I spent a wonderful six months reading Gibbon, and we'd met every week, and somebody would give a paper.

21:37.521 --> 21:38.262
It was a real seminar.

21:38.815 --> 21:44.203
and so on, except that we met at the Century Club and with the fancy food and so on.

21:44.223 --> 21:45.064
It was very nice.

21:45.384 --> 22:05.633
And so a few years later when I came to Yale, I said, we could publish you in a way that I think that Harper wanted to, that we could deliver, we could give you a broader audience and so on, and also would be to do a really proper job of publishing the serious books.

22:06.507 --> 22:15.558
And I guess we must have done 15 books together overall, but the breakthrough one was Jesus Through the Centuries.

22:15.578 --> 22:17.119
Yeah, it's a great book.

22:17.139 --> 22:17.880
It's a great book.

22:17.900 --> 22:34.860
And he actually came to me one time, and he said, we were having lunch here, walking back from August, and he said, he said, I had a proposal from the Reader's Digest, and they wanted me, they wanted him to do a

22:35.279 --> 22:36.842
Big, broad book on Jesus.

22:36.862 --> 22:38.725
They didn't specify.

22:38.745 --> 22:45.416
And he said, well, you know, I've been thinking all my life about doing a book like this, and it wouldn't be like that.

22:45.436 --> 22:47.640
So they said, write a proposal.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.281
And they paid him.

22:48.781 --> 22:49.683
This is Reader's Digest.

22:49.983 --> 22:50.765
Reader's Digest.

22:50.785 --> 22:54.551
They paid him, I think it was $25,000 just to write a proposal.

22:54.571 --> 22:55.352
This is Reader's Digest.

22:55.873 --> 22:56.254
Yeah.

22:56.274 --> 23:00.561
And he, and this is, this is 1980 or something like that.

23:00.878 --> 23:04.422
And so he wrote it, and they were horrified.

23:06.265 --> 23:07.246
They survived.

23:07.366 --> 23:08.668
Our people can't understand this.

23:08.688 --> 23:09.689
You know, this is too complicated.

23:09.709 --> 23:11.892
That is funny.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.934
Read his digest, getting something that's sophisticated.

23:13.954 --> 23:14.575
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:14.595 --> 23:15.897
I mean, they just didn't know what the hell to do with it.

23:15.917 --> 23:22.044
So he told me, I said, well, wow, we'll publish it, and I'll find some more money, and we'll do that.

23:22.325 --> 23:24.267
And they just said, keep the money, forget it.

23:24.347 --> 23:29.113
And so he said, well, this is really what I'd like to do.

23:30.494 --> 23:31.996
And then he worked out a deal.

23:34.218 --> 23:36.280
The university set up a lectureship.

23:37.982 --> 23:50.094
It had all sorts of elaborate lectureships, all involved bringing in scholars from outside, but they set up one where they would actually have their own people come and give a lecture course, as it were.

23:50.615 --> 23:52.317
And it was hugely successful.

23:52.437 --> 23:57.582
And this was designed with bellicent mind, to be sure.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.531
He said, this is what it's going to be.

23:59.551 --> 24:04.296
Jesus through the centuries, and it's going to be 20 chapters, or how he had sort of planned the whole thing out.

24:04.456 --> 24:13.506
And they created a kind of course which was open to the public as well as to students anywhere.

24:13.906 --> 24:15.968
Long before the internet, too.

24:16.028 --> 24:16.309
Yeah.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.209
Opening it to the public.

24:17.229 --> 24:19.232
Yeah, no, just people coming off the street.

24:19.532 --> 24:26.539
So we went, I remember he told me, he said, the first lecture's going to be at the Law School Auditorium, which is a big,

24:26.941 --> 24:29.925
venue, 1,200, 1,400 seats, something like that.

24:30.806 --> 24:37.714
And then I remember he called me a couple of days before and he said, we're oversubscribed.

24:37.734 --> 24:46.525
And so for the entire 20 weeks, whatever it was, that he gave that course, he gave the lecture twice in succession.

24:46.545 --> 24:50.450
Three o'clock and four o'clock, or four o'clock and five o'clock.

24:50.710 --> 24:53.353
And every time there was a thousand or more people there.

24:53.873 --> 24:55.335
And he talked about this.

24:55.436 --> 24:56.578
How do you explain this?

24:56.598 --> 25:01.346
Was his celebrity such that this— Well, I think it was a—first of all, it was a seductive topic.

25:02.027 --> 25:04.912
And yes, I mean, he was extremely well-known.

25:04.932 --> 25:06.034
That's 2,000 people a week.

25:06.074 --> 25:07.035
Yeah, yeah.

25:07.136 --> 25:08.378
I mean, this is something.

25:08.558 --> 25:11.623
And they were coming from considerable distances.

25:12.224 --> 25:13.907
And—well, I mean, hundreds of them were students.

25:14.613 --> 25:18.481
And they also met in sections and did other things.

25:18.501 --> 25:20.485
He had teaching assistants.

25:20.505 --> 25:25.755
But most people, like me, I just sat there in the front row and heard this stuff that I had never heard before.

25:26.196 --> 25:27.559
And he's a compelling lecturer.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.376
I mean, he's a dramatic and exciting lecturer.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.680
And did the text pretty much parallel the lectures?

25:33.700 --> 25:34.060
Absolutely, yeah.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.342
I mean, I was reading the chapters.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.423
Is that right?

25:36.443 --> 25:37.144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:37.164 --> 25:37.825
It was very close.

25:37.845 --> 25:39.867
But that was terrific that you attended the lecture.

25:40.028 --> 25:41.730
Oh, well, I was a senator, too.

25:41.750 --> 25:46.375
I mean, not that I had any... So how early in your tenure did this happen?

25:46.395 --> 25:48.398
Oh, in the first few years, yeah.

25:48.418 --> 25:49.499
So that's really fabulous.

25:49.639 --> 25:56.888
Yeah, it got me off to a running start, and it was a very successful book, and...

25:57.661 --> 25:59.123
Like, roughly.

25:59.203 --> 25:59.904
I mean, I'll find it.

25:59.944 --> 26:02.447
I'll get the numbers, but what would you guess?

26:04.710 --> 26:09.576
Oh, I don't know.

26:09.596 --> 26:11.758
It probably sold hardcover.

26:13.220 --> 26:16.384
Maybe it sold 30,000 or 40,000.

26:16.624 --> 26:21.530
Ed Morgan told me today of the 15 or so books that he's written, he's done two for Yale.

26:21.971 --> 26:25.575
But the best-selling book of all time that he's had is his Benjamin Franklin book.

26:25.741 --> 26:26.141
Yeah.

26:26.161 --> 26:27.083
100,000 copies.

26:27.203 --> 26:27.963
Right, right.

26:28.204 --> 26:31.227
And I said, wow, that's a fabulous sale.

26:31.688 --> 26:34.731
I said, is that the best-selling book in Yale history?

26:34.771 --> 26:36.513
He said, no, not even close.

26:36.914 --> 26:37.434
No, not even close.

26:37.454 --> 26:43.441
And he named a book for me that I'd never heard of before, that had sold probably a million copies.

26:44.042 --> 26:46.044
I got the title here someplace.

26:48.406 --> 26:49.388
I'm curious what he tells you.

26:50.989 --> 26:53.352
Right there, I'm going to find it.

26:53.632 --> 26:54.313
Hold on.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.248
indulge me here.

26:56.588 --> 26:57.169
Yeah, sure.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.011
The Lonely Crowd.

26:59.031 --> 26:59.532
Oh, yes.

27:00.053 --> 27:00.553
Absolutely.

27:00.593 --> 27:04.958
That is one of the... Which I've never heard about the book.

27:04.978 --> 27:07.041
It's a sociology textbook, apparently.

27:07.161 --> 27:07.441
Well, no.

27:07.581 --> 27:08.202
Well, not really.

27:08.362 --> 27:19.035
David Reisman wrote The Lonely Crowd in the early 1950s, and it was a book that first posited this

27:19.252 --> 27:23.618
inter-directed and outer-directed, the way people are, and so on.

27:23.638 --> 27:28.826
It's a turgid, difficult book to read, but it sold fabulously.

27:29.186 --> 27:35.055
And he went on to a long career as a sociologist at Harvard, and so on.

27:35.716 --> 27:42.666
But it was published in an exotic little series, monographs, on something or other in, I think, 1950.

27:42.806 --> 27:47.453
I used to have in my office one of the first

27:47.821 --> 27:48.622
copies of it.

27:48.942 --> 27:52.665
And I think the first printing was 1,500 copies.

27:53.506 --> 27:57.249
And it sold, and it sort of staggered everybody.

27:57.269 --> 27:58.650
It kept selling and kept selling.

27:59.411 --> 28:16.866
And about the time that it had sold 400,000 or 500,000 copies, it was licensed to Anchor Books, Double Day Anchor Books, which was the first trade paperback, quality paperback imprint.

28:17.183 --> 28:19.346
And they sold about 5 million copies.

28:19.786 --> 28:24.612
And then the press got the rights back and sold another 700,000 or 800,000 copies.

28:24.932 --> 28:27.655
And you never heard of the book today.

28:27.956 --> 28:34.744
No, but it was widely read from the 50s through the 70s.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.388
Was it influential in any way?

28:38.408 --> 28:40.931
I think it was, yeah.

28:44.035 --> 28:46.077
That's astonishing.

28:46.259 --> 28:49.403
The press has had other million copy sellers as well.

28:49.803 --> 28:51.705
For instance?

28:51.725 --> 28:54.288
Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey and Tonight.

28:54.348 --> 28:55.470
You guys published that.

28:55.490 --> 28:55.650
Yeah.

28:56.030 --> 28:56.271
Wow.

28:56.371 --> 28:57.472
There's another story there.

28:57.492 --> 28:58.493
And that sold a million copies?

28:58.513 --> 28:59.895
A play sells a million copies.

29:00.135 --> 29:06.723
Well, it was required reading in all of those undergraduate courses on American drama or American literature and so on.

29:06.743 --> 29:10.127
That's the trick, get that thing assigned to the classrooms.

29:10.147 --> 29:16.114
Another story, and you will encounter it if you ask about that book.

29:16.988 --> 29:25.843
Um, Eugene O'Neill was first published by, um, uh... Bonnie and Libwright, I think.

29:25.863 --> 29:26.624
Horace Libwright.

29:26.644 --> 29:27.005
Horace Libwright.

29:27.806 --> 29:38.985
And, um, uh, who was a really exciting and interesting publisher of the 20s, and, you know, he went belly up at the beginning of the Depression and... Published beautiful books.

29:39.065 --> 29:40.027
Yeah, very nice books.

29:40.207 --> 29:43.232
And, and, uh, and he published some wonderful people.

29:43.583 --> 29:46.547
But he was a terrible businessman, and he was always in debt.

29:46.848 --> 30:00.026
And one of the young people who worked for him and who bought a share of the company in the 20s was a kid named Bennett Cerf.

30:00.046 --> 30:05.974
And a few years after he joined, he wanted to go in on his own.

30:06.275 --> 30:10.480
And Cerf said to Liberite, I'll help you out.

30:10.621 --> 30:11.582
I'll find you some money.

30:11.933 --> 30:17.578
I will buy your reprint series, The Modern Library.

30:17.899 --> 30:22.863
And he bought The Modern Library, and it became, of course, The Modern Library.

30:22.883 --> 30:25.106
It became the foundation of Random House, though, of course.

30:25.626 --> 30:41.181
And O'Neill came, uh, uh, I think there was already some O'Neill plays on that, on the Modern Library list, and later when, um, uh, Liveright went under, um, Serf

30:41.785 --> 30:50.159
got O'Neill and a fabulous editor who came with him, who O'Neill wanted, and he stayed with him.

30:50.179 --> 31:06.966
And they, all those years, published, and when O'Neill died, he had given all of his papers to the Yale Library, and the understanding was that

31:07.722 --> 31:16.894
his last plays, especially this one, which was so autobiographical, were not to be published for a little, considerably, not to be produced for a considerable period of time.

31:17.555 --> 31:34.877
And Cerf was prepared to honor that, but the widow, O'Neill, an actress named Carlotta O'Neill, wanted the plays published, so, and produced, so the famous Circle on the Square production thing, and then Cerf said, well,

31:35.363 --> 31:37.326
pledged to Gene and I wouldn't have published it.

31:37.566 --> 31:39.089
Well, if that happened today.

31:39.109 --> 31:41.372
And the books came to Yale.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.195
That's a great story.

31:43.315 --> 31:43.556
Yeah.

31:43.576 --> 31:45.539
That will definitely get into this.

31:45.579 --> 32:03.987
Well, you know, and, and, and, I mean, I think Bennett Cerf was a very great publisher, and, and he, he was a man of his honor, but the press ended up publishing the last four plays, um, um, which included, which, of course, this great play, but also included, um, um,

32:04.861 --> 32:10.769
Touch of the Poet, and I think it's Moon for the Misbegotten, and a little one-act play called Huey.

32:10.789 --> 32:32.218
And they published those over the years, and about ten years ago, somebody counted it up, and it was about the time of the last really big revival on Broadway with Jason Robards and Maureen Stapleton, and we had sold a million copies of the book then.

32:32.722 --> 32:34.424
And so on.

32:34.665 --> 32:42.335
And we published, we issued a new and corrected edition, because some scholar had found some lines.

32:43.257 --> 32:46.701
So that extends the copyright, too, doesn't it?

32:48.223 --> 32:48.324
Yeah.

32:48.704 --> 32:58.037
He wrote in hard pencil, like a number one, a number three pencil or something like that.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.847
if it was Carlotta or somebody, whoever typed from that, simply missed the line.

33:03.348 --> 33:11.684
And it's the line that says that what you had to guess before, which was that, in fact, she's taking drugs.

33:12.044 --> 33:14.910
It's right there in the handwriting.

33:14.930 --> 33:15.531
Yeah, it's clear.

33:15.691 --> 33:18.477
I mean, it was supposed to be a line in the play, and it's never mentioned.

33:18.657 --> 33:21.342
You just have to kind of... So is that the only...

33:21.760 --> 33:22.621
significant difference?

33:23.062 --> 33:24.905
That's a major difference.

33:24.925 --> 33:27.329
And it's certainly enough to give you a different edition of the book.

33:27.429 --> 33:28.270
Yeah, it was.

33:28.390 --> 33:28.771
And so on.

33:28.811 --> 33:35.301
Of course, through all of those years, we had the literary property, not the press.

33:35.541 --> 33:38.927
But the university was the repository of all of the rights.

33:39.347 --> 33:49.523
And so, whoever it was, Samuel French, every time somebody did the play, they had to rent the things or buy the things from them and so on.

33:50.009 --> 33:56.719
I think those are the two million copy-setters in our... Well, that's a great story.

33:56.739 --> 33:58.082
Yeah.

33:58.102 --> 34:00.305
How about stuff like Lefty Lewis's stuff?

34:00.325 --> 34:02.588
I mean, that's kind of subsidy publishing in a way, right?

34:02.669 --> 34:03.149
Absolutely.

34:03.951 --> 34:08.558
That would have just been the kind of thing that happened in that earlier regime, right?

34:08.578 --> 34:10.381
Well, it did, and it continued to happen.

34:10.541 --> 34:16.089
I mean, it's a little bit like publishing the Franklin Papers, in a way, except that Lefty paid for everything.

34:16.490 --> 34:17.772
Well, that's a...

34:18.022 --> 34:24.629
Well, I wonder if the Lamarth Lewis papers would have been published otherwise.

34:24.709 --> 34:26.471
Absolutely not.

34:26.551 --> 34:34.340
And their scholarly—I'm sure they're important, but I'm dancing around in circles here.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.501
I love Lefty Lewis.

34:35.521 --> 34:36.563
He was a bibliomaniac.

34:36.643 --> 34:37.183
Yeah, I know.

34:37.283 --> 34:45.092
And it was done because he wanted it done, and he was willing to pay for it, and it was

34:47.452 --> 34:49.094
They were beautiful.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.196
You'd seen them, you know.

34:50.236 --> 34:58.646
I met him and visited with him at the great library.

34:58.666 --> 35:01.690
I wrote about it in my first book.

35:01.710 --> 35:03.373
Of course you did, yeah.

35:03.813 --> 35:06.136
Well, I remember being with him.

35:06.557 --> 35:11.223
But it's one of the kinds of things, this whole gentleman atmosphere that's going on.

35:11.383 --> 35:11.884
Exactly.

35:11.964 --> 35:14.607
And of course, Chester loved that.

35:14.941 --> 35:18.464
That's actually the way he'd pay for the whole thing.

35:18.845 --> 35:20.987
He'd pay for everything.

35:22.568 --> 35:36.861
There was a lovely man named Louis Martz, who was a professor of English here, and he took me up to meet Lefty, and he said, you know, they were fascinated by this.

35:38.122 --> 35:44.188
He was a very old man, quite ill at the time, but he took us into his inner sanctum, you know, and he held

35:45.080 --> 35:50.968
a copy of, Walpole's own copy of something that the Pope had written in.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.833
You know, look at this, look at this.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.275
And he said, I feel faint.

35:56.376 --> 35:57.157
I have to lie down.

35:57.177 --> 35:58.358
I mean, it's just so exciting.

35:58.378 --> 35:59.460
I just wish I had that story.

35:59.540 --> 36:02.424
That's the kind of story that I would have used.

36:02.444 --> 36:04.427
Yeah, he was fabulous.

36:05.228 --> 36:14.901
And, you know, we had lunch, and the Irish maid in the uniform comes in, and the whole, the whole thing, it was just like something out of another century.

36:15.134 --> 36:19.720
But Lefty, well, you probably don't make the connection.

36:19.780 --> 36:27.049
He was also, for quite a number of years, the so-called senior fellow of Yale, meaning the chairman of the board of trustees.

36:27.530 --> 36:27.810
Yeah.

36:27.911 --> 36:28.952
Not as significant.

36:28.972 --> 36:32.376
And he, Louie and others told me stories.

36:32.396 --> 36:38.825
He said he thought nothing of calling the president of the university at 8 o'clock in the morning because something wasn't right, and he wanted it fixed right away.

36:39.546 --> 36:43.791
And he was always, and he called me at all hours of the day, send a copy of my

36:44.665 --> 36:48.049
whatever, something of his, to this library, because you know what he was doing?

36:48.089 --> 37:07.475
He was tracking down the original copy that had actually been in Walpole's possession, so he had a copy of something else that he'd gotten somewhere else, so he would say, so-and-so library, we'll do a swap, and then you give them, you know, the set, the 60-volume set.

37:07.495 --> 37:08.817
It's one of these things you had to do.

37:09.237 --> 37:13.002
And that's like Lloyd Coats today at Princeton, I mean, with that great

37:13.336 --> 37:16.921
a great library of children's books that Princeton really didn't want.

37:16.961 --> 37:17.823
You know, I've written about it.

37:18.043 --> 37:18.484
Yeah.

37:18.804 --> 37:19.686
Tuck me out of school here.

37:19.706 --> 37:20.587
Everybody knows about it.

37:20.887 --> 37:28.359
But he's like the number one trustee and probably the most generous benefactor in the history of the university.

37:28.439 --> 37:28.879
Right.

37:28.899 --> 37:32.525
So this person speaks and says, I want to put up a children's library.

37:32.825 --> 37:33.566
Yeah.

37:33.586 --> 37:34.127
Well, all right.

37:34.207 --> 37:37.392
No one has a single course in children's literature taught at the university.

37:38.594 --> 37:39.315
You do it.

37:39.335 --> 37:41.318
But, you know, he...

37:42.091 --> 37:42.692
Could be worse.

37:42.752 --> 37:44.473
Could be somebody who wants football, right?

37:44.554 --> 37:45.054
I mean, you know.

37:45.114 --> 37:46.235
Yeah, well, I think it's wonderful.

37:46.255 --> 37:46.956
It is wonderful.

37:46.996 --> 37:55.505
So, I mean, these— Anything that does what he did with books and— With books and— How could that possibly, you know— And the books had to be just so.

37:56.085 --> 37:57.547
You know, it had to be real gold.

37:58.728 --> 37:59.189
That's right.

37:59.209 --> 37:59.469
Yeah.

37:59.629 --> 38:01.711
And this—and the cloth—you know, no corners.

38:02.452 --> 38:04.054
Cut no—he paid for everything.

38:04.074 --> 38:10.360
But there's a man whose name you'll run across as you read the press files named Ralph Brown.

38:10.610 --> 38:27.172
And Ralph Brown was a professor of law, and on the various presses' boards for many, many years, and copyright law was one of his fields, and so on.

38:27.752 --> 38:28.433
Marvelous guy.

38:29.795 --> 38:37.545
He, when he got out of the, no.

38:37.778 --> 38:46.627
When he graduated from Yale in the late 30s, he briefly worked on the Walpole Project and met his first wife there.

38:47.088 --> 39:06.047
And he told me that Lefty paid all the salaries and benefits of all the editors who worked on those things from about 1930 to 1990.

39:07.192 --> 39:09.517
Wow.

39:09.718 --> 39:11.101
Or 1985, whatever it was.

39:11.722 --> 39:17.856
So for a couple of generations, that's what he was doing.

39:18.076 --> 39:25.673
And so what he paid for the publication costs was a fraction of the total cost.

39:25.940 --> 39:28.885
He was paying X number of salaries a year.

39:29.325 --> 39:29.586
Amazing.

39:29.666 --> 39:30.888
So it's worthwhile.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.050
The books are there.

39:32.150 --> 39:32.711
The books are there.

39:32.731 --> 39:34.594
They're very important.

39:34.814 --> 39:34.914
Yeah.

39:34.934 --> 39:36.817
Would you have done it without that sort of connection?

39:36.857 --> 39:37.358
Not likely.

39:37.398 --> 39:38.600
Couldn't have.

39:39.001 --> 39:52.622
One of the things that Yale and all the other presses struggled to do was to maintain and continue to publish all of these grand series, like

39:53.176 --> 39:54.658
the Founding Fathers series.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.862
Yeah, and I do want to talk about that, too.

39:56.882 --> 39:57.382
Yeah, yeah.

39:57.483 --> 40:02.150
Because that really is something that only university presses are doing.

40:02.170 --> 40:02.610
Only, yeah.

40:02.630 --> 40:03.392
I talked about this.

40:03.592 --> 40:05.034
We did, we did on the phone.

40:05.054 --> 40:05.775
Yeah.

40:06.597 --> 40:11.504
And you even wonder if that's going to survive a long haul.

40:11.805 --> 40:12.826
I don't think it will.

40:14.829 --> 40:21.259
We had to let some go, or say to them, we can only do them if you can

40:21.577 --> 40:23.739
find some other kind of support somewhere.

40:24.340 --> 40:35.892
And when the first of the Founding Fathers series began in the 50s, there was a lot of money to support them.

40:35.993 --> 40:37.935
There was some government interest and whatnot.

40:38.215 --> 40:46.984
And the Jefferson papers particularly, and the Franklin papers, they saw the lead ones there.

40:47.425 --> 40:51.229
And they knew they were going to be terribly long and so on.

40:51.597 --> 40:55.681
a good deal of support, and the book sold very well.

40:55.701 --> 40:56.602
Very important point.

40:57.203 --> 40:58.925
Everybody had to have the father's glory.

40:59.145 --> 40:59.485
Yeah, yeah.

40:59.545 --> 41:15.722
Well, the fifties, of course, was also a time with a huge expansion of education in this country, higher education especially, and spending on education, and libraries were, college and school libraries were growing, and something like that.

41:15.742 --> 41:19.326
And in the early days, could sell

41:19.913 --> 41:22.598
2,000 or so of each of these volumes.

41:25.062 --> 41:32.376
For the Franklin papers, probably now sell six or seven hundred now.

41:32.396 --> 41:43.997
They're just as big, they cost just as much to do, I mean more in dollars, but I mean they're very expensive and so on, and there are many fewer copies to spread the costs over, the price goes way up, and

41:44.770 --> 41:45.591
And they're not buying.

41:45.611 --> 41:47.993
So, I mean, there are thousands of incomplete sets.

41:48.133 --> 41:50.035
And why aren't they buying, do you think?

41:50.055 --> 41:56.001
Well, I think it's this... The same thing happened to the scholarly monograph.

41:57.202 --> 42:12.938
The federal funding for higher education was cut at the end of the Johnson administration, and that, in fact, was financing the purchases

42:13.407 --> 42:20.455
the library purchases, and when it was pulled out, there was a terrible downward spiral.

42:20.615 --> 42:34.270
First of all, all the publishers got hurt because they had inventory they couldn't sell, and then they cut their print runs, and then they put the prices up and spinning.

42:34.290 --> 42:42.098
At the same time, libraries were especially college and university libraries,

42:42.584 --> 42:56.537
were beginning to spend ever larger portions of their acquisition budgets, first on the sciences and then on, and that meant journal purchases.

42:56.557 --> 42:58.658
Do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures, by the way?

42:58.678 --> 42:59.079
Yeah, sure.

42:59.099 --> 42:59.539
Go right ahead.

42:59.719 --> 43:00.120
Yeah.

43:00.140 --> 43:03.143
Then on journal purchases and then finally on technology.

43:04.784 --> 43:08.828
So today, I don't know what.

43:08.968 --> 43:12.591
It might be something like 25 cents of a university library

43:13.111 --> 43:14.553
budget goes to buying books.

43:15.754 --> 43:18.218
It's not a dedicated budget as it used to be in the old days.

43:18.698 --> 43:18.959
Exactly.

43:18.979 --> 43:19.099
Right.

43:19.119 --> 43:20.321
So what happens?

43:21.562 --> 43:26.108
How many volumes in the Franklin, roughly how many volumes in the Franklin series would you say?

43:26.188 --> 43:28.611
I don't know, 60 or something.

43:28.632 --> 43:29.433
Yeah, I mean, I'll shoot.

43:29.453 --> 43:30.154
It's still going.

43:30.174 --> 43:31.856
I mean, it's still going, yeah.

43:32.517 --> 43:35.420
I'm trying to remember, I was on the board for a long time.

43:35.461 --> 43:38.324
Franklin's already in France.

43:38.344 --> 43:41.869
He's

43:42.608 --> 43:45.431
I think they can finish in 12 or 14 more volumes.

43:46.111 --> 43:58.803
But at Princeton, the Jefferson papers are so far behind that they have a two-track deal, and they think it's going to take 25 or 30 years to publish all of that.

43:59.384 --> 44:05.069
Of course, he lives as long as Franklin does and so on.

44:05.089 --> 44:05.710
You like the butler?

44:06.030 --> 44:06.670
Or the cat?

44:06.690 --> 44:11.535
I've got a cat that I have for 10 years, and he had a twin sister who ran away, and they're looking

44:12.528 --> 44:14.290
Almost that cat reincarnated.

44:14.350 --> 44:14.790
Really?

44:15.531 --> 44:20.836
I've yet to see another cat that just looks like my old Ivan, instead of taking a picture of Peter Martin.

44:20.856 --> 44:22.418
His name is Joe.

44:22.438 --> 44:23.218
Yeah.

44:23.238 --> 44:24.740
Yeah.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.201
Perfect.

44:30.686 --> 44:30.786
Yeah.

44:30.806 --> 44:32.107
So, um... I got the butler, too.

44:32.147 --> 44:33.008
You got the butler, too.

44:33.028 --> 44:35.370
Yeah, right.

44:35.751 --> 44:42.417
The biggest challenge, I think, that all of the university presses face from the mid-'70s on

44:42.768 --> 44:52.741
was how to make a go of it, because selling the books that they were publishing wasn't paying for the cost of doing it.

44:52.761 --> 44:58.087
And some of them never recovered.

44:58.848 --> 45:11.965
And a few of them went out of business, but a lot of them scaled down, and they just couldn't handle it.

45:12.299 --> 45:17.667
At Yale, it was certainly the biggest challenge that I faced.

45:21.272 --> 45:25.177
Not just the editions, Franklin and so on, and Yale published fifteen or twenty of them.

45:25.197 --> 45:28.101
They were all different kinds and so on.

45:28.121 --> 45:39.758
But any kind of standard monograph, the revised dissertation that gets published or the first important book, one of the ten-year books and so on.

45:41.088 --> 45:53.942
It wasn't working, so ways had to be found to bring in enough income to keep doing that, but something else had to be done.

45:54.002 --> 46:01.671
Did you, a word that's, I don't want to overuse it, but did you have this, who was it, which of our presidents called it the vision thing?

46:02.111 --> 46:06.336
Did you have a vision for the press when you

46:06.502 --> 46:07.023
When I came?

46:08.464 --> 46:09.486
Not an accurate one.

46:09.626 --> 46:10.887
Not one that I followed.

46:12.069 --> 46:17.676
Let me just preface that by saying that the Yale University press operates in the black now, too.

46:18.477 --> 46:20.960
It may be unique among American... Very close.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.021
Very close to it.

46:22.141 --> 46:26.827
Without giving up the mission.

46:26.847 --> 46:29.170
So if you could just give me a little riff on that.

46:29.390 --> 46:35.698
Yeah, well... We did it by making the...

46:35.881 --> 46:38.484
The list, the entire list, pay for itself.

46:38.564 --> 46:46.292
That is to say, the mix of books, which is what Harper and Row does, HarperCollins does.

46:46.312 --> 46:47.514
Thank God.

46:48.134 --> 46:51.979
Yeah, and add a... Because they've got Michael Crichton, you know?

46:51.999 --> 46:52.700
Yes, exactly.

46:52.740 --> 46:58.005
They have Michael Crichton, and they have cookbooks, and they have children's books, and so on.

46:58.025 --> 47:05.854
So the mix of things is what works, and that's what I...

47:06.239 --> 47:36.010
set out to do, and I toyed with the idea of doing something with journals, because I'd come from Chicago, which had a strong journals program, but it was clear that it wasn't possible to do that at Yale, so it was then by what I said something like, what I wanted to do was enrich the mix of books, and we did it in several ways, but one of them was to get

47:36.412 --> 47:47.309
the very same scholars who wrote the monographs to write bigger books on broader subjects.

47:47.590 --> 47:50.234
Jesus Through the Centuries is a perfect example.

47:50.254 --> 48:03.735
And in those books, if and when they reached a larger audience, and with Jesus Through the Centuries, for example, it wasn't just that

48:04.306 --> 48:07.174
That book sold 25,000, 35,000 copies.

48:08.639 --> 48:16.341
We then sold the paperback rights for $100,000 to Harper.

48:17.485 --> 48:20.047
Later, we published an illustrated edition of it.

48:20.308 --> 48:22.630
So it was, those were commercial things to do.

48:22.950 --> 48:25.933
Later on, he wrote a companion volume, Mary.

48:25.953 --> 48:30.878
In fact, I wrote a review of it for my Christmas roundup a couple years back.

48:30.898 --> 48:31.098
Did you?

48:31.118 --> 48:31.678
Yeah.

48:31.698 --> 48:34.321
Because it was a nice, beautifully illustrated book.

48:34.461 --> 48:35.462
Yes, the illustrated book.

48:35.502 --> 48:36.883
Absolutely, the illustrated Mary.

48:36.903 --> 48:44.050
I mean, we did the, so, did that, and we,

48:46.223 --> 48:54.611
began to publish in sort of earnest some textbooks, building on a strength, the pre-existing strength.

48:54.651 --> 48:57.094
And they did very well.

48:57.694 --> 49:10.286
And, and this is most important, at the same time the art and art history list that was largely published out of our London office began to grow and get very strong.

49:10.327 --> 49:12.809
It's the strongest kind in the world.

49:12.849 --> 49:14.931
I don't know another publisher that does

49:15.383 --> 49:17.786
And our book, Abrams, forget about it.

49:17.806 --> 49:19.549
Forget about it.

49:19.789 --> 49:21.071
And who else is there these days?

49:21.131 --> 49:24.236
There's only Abbeville, but yours are just... Abbeville.

49:24.256 --> 49:26.659
Are they still around?

49:26.679 --> 49:26.960
Barely.

49:27.280 --> 49:37.455
And that is the work of one man, basically one man, John Nickel.

49:38.216 --> 49:39.758
Somebody I must meet.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.522
And I can give you the...

49:42.670 --> 49:45.954
50 cent sketch.

49:47.415 --> 49:53.722
John Nickel was an editor at Oxford University Press.

49:56.265 --> 50:02.011
Solid, came from a very comfortable upper middle class background.

50:03.873 --> 50:05.955
Grew up in Kendall in the Lake District.

50:07.397 --> 50:11.361
Went to Winchester

50:11.813 --> 50:13.195
then Balliol, Oxford.

50:18.982 --> 50:24.730
John would be about 61 today, something like that.

50:25.410 --> 50:39.829
He was interested in art and interested in publishing, and he took a job at the press at Oxford, right there in Oxford.

50:40.940 --> 50:42.362
And he did a very unusual thing.

50:42.402 --> 50:50.952
He said he wanted to be able to control the quality of the production quality of the books that he did.

50:50.992 --> 51:09.495
So instead of just working as an editor, he worked in what they call the engine room, the production department at Oxford, to learn what it is you do to make a book and get it to look right, something that really

51:09.695 --> 51:11.577
that any editor has a feel for.

51:12.639 --> 51:24.955
And the greatest example in American publishing of an editor-publisher who learned all of that and made beautiful books was Alfred Knopf.

51:24.975 --> 51:35.449
And John Nickel won better in this regard because he took on the much more elaborate business of publishing art books.

51:35.665 --> 51:40.851
And he was also the protege of one of the brilliant senior people at the press.

51:41.311 --> 51:48.259
And so he got to do a lot of interesting things, and he was doing very well at Oxford.

51:48.860 --> 52:05.098
And in the early 1970s, the Paul Mellon Center for British Art, which operated in London,

52:05.669 --> 52:10.775
had taken on the job of publishing some art books.

52:11.836 --> 52:16.041
And do you know the British Art Center here in New Haven?

52:16.902 --> 52:20.427
It's the sort of, it's counterpart.

52:20.707 --> 52:22.269
And it's also a Mellon Project.

52:22.289 --> 52:23.550
And it's also a Mellon Project.

52:23.871 --> 52:29.217
And they... They brought the Stubbs pictures from Worcester.

52:29.798 --> 52:30.799
Yeah, right.

52:30.863 --> 52:34.288
A million bucks for Worcester for these drawings they didn't even know they had, you know.

52:34.949 --> 52:35.910
Fabulous stuff.

52:35.930 --> 52:37.812
But this was Mellon.

52:38.093 --> 52:45.423
And so they published a catalogue resume, I think it was of Gainsborough, and they might have done one or two others.

52:46.164 --> 53:00.263
And they began, the Mellon Center in London was losing so much money on publishing those books that even Mellon said, Boston, you've got to do something about this.

53:00.631 --> 53:03.674
But it's hemorrhaging that much.

53:04.074 --> 53:05.135
Yeah, it's hemorrhaging.

53:06.417 --> 53:09.179
They had a negative gross market.

53:09.199 --> 53:13.043
I mean, they were sort of, for every dollar that the book sold for, they lost two or three.

53:13.063 --> 53:14.104
You know, it was just staggering.

53:14.124 --> 53:21.711
So the press had its little overseas office in the same building.

53:22.973 --> 53:28.398
I forget, not Bedford Square.

53:28.418 --> 53:30.520
Anyway, one of the squares around there.

53:31.023 --> 53:44.398
They turned to Chester and said, you know about publishing, could you do something to stop the hemorrhaging?

53:44.539 --> 53:46.821
And he said, let me see what I can do.

53:47.262 --> 53:48.804
And he decided to hire somebody.

53:48.844 --> 53:55.191
Well, he found John Nickel and said, take over these publishing projects and fix them.

53:55.451 --> 53:55.772
He did.

53:55.792 --> 53:57.874
And then he said, well,

53:58.141 --> 53:59.142
All right.

53:59.182 --> 54:01.745
Nickle was very good, said, you know, okay, I'm doing that.

54:02.145 --> 54:03.426
And I got him under control.

54:03.586 --> 54:06.269
Now I, you know, I think, let's do something else.

54:06.289 --> 54:13.136
And within a few years, he had built a superb program of original books.

54:13.536 --> 54:15.278
So what's the trick?

54:15.618 --> 54:20.043
How does he take something that's hemorrhaging money and turn it into?

54:20.063 --> 54:23.546
Well, I mean, I realize it's almost impossible.

54:23.626 --> 54:25.568
It's not, but it's not smoke and mirrors.

54:25.648 --> 54:27.270
I mean, he...

54:27.571 --> 54:31.085
You brought a business model to... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:31.105 --> 54:35.522
And he said, I can get better quality typesetting

54:35.873 --> 54:52.574
here, get it sooner and on time than what you're paying for, and I can get the book printed over here, the color work done over here for a better price, and you start doing that, you get the author under control, and you get the stuff in when it's supposed to be done, and, you know.

54:52.594 --> 54:55.978
There was this perception that Uncle Paul was probably always going to pay for it.

54:55.998 --> 54:56.418
Sure, sure.

54:56.819 --> 54:58.341
And they didn't know what to do.

54:58.421 --> 55:00.143
And it's a difficult

55:00.595 --> 55:05.723
There aren't too many art book publishers, because you can lose your shirt if you get it wrong.

55:05.743 --> 55:11.091
And so he was very shrewd and savvy, very smart, very hardworking, very tough.

55:11.111 --> 55:22.468
And he had two early successes, and one was a book that just sort of landed in his lap,

55:22.651 --> 55:27.937
by Elizabeth Murray, and it was the story of the Oxford Dictionary called Caught in the Web of Words.

55:27.957 --> 55:28.657
That's a great book.

55:28.677 --> 55:29.839
It's a lovely, lovely book.

55:29.879 --> 55:31.220
Terrific book.

55:31.240 --> 55:39.489
Um, but he had previously, he had, um, published at Oxford, um, a man named Mark Girouard.

55:40.350 --> 55:41.151
Sure.

55:41.171 --> 55:41.551
Yeah.

55:41.571 --> 55:49.079
And Mark had written a book called The Victorian Country House, and it was published— Nice little illustrated book, right?

55:49.099 --> 55:49.199
Yeah.

55:49.219 --> 55:52.523
Well, but it was not the—it was—but it was, um,

55:52.739 --> 55:57.645
It had a handful of colored plates and something else.

55:57.665 --> 56:05.575
And John told me later, he said, when it was published, after it was published, he and Mark, they said, you know, there's a better way to do this.

56:05.735 --> 56:07.818
And this book wasn't right.

56:07.838 --> 56:08.999
And he wanted to try it again.

56:09.019 --> 56:12.083
So when he got to Yale, he invited him.

56:12.103 --> 56:17.670
He said, get the rights back from Oxford.

56:17.710 --> 56:19.152
And I'm going to reissue it.

56:19.604 --> 56:24.331
And what they wanted to do was completely integrate the illustrations in the text.

56:24.712 --> 56:25.393
Much more complex.

56:25.413 --> 56:28.317
Every page has to be laid out, and the type has to fit, and so on.

56:29.139 --> 56:29.840
But it's doable.

56:30.501 --> 56:37.311
And in the midst of that, Mark got the assignment to give a series of, I think they were called the Slade Lectures at the National Gallery.

56:38.373 --> 56:42.659
And so they decided to try it with that book instead.

56:42.699 --> 56:45.303
And that book was called Life in the English Country House.

56:45.383 --> 56:48.548
And it was a huge success.

56:48.764 --> 57:10.181
It sold, I think it was 50,000 or 60,000 copies, and that was just when I was coming to Yale, and it was Chester's last hurrah, and it was the week before I started, paperback rights were sold to Penguin for 100,000 pounds, and it was really moving.

57:10.201 --> 57:12.966
Well, John—

57:13.216 --> 57:17.623
And John started to build an art list really from there, from that beginning.

57:17.763 --> 57:21.949
So this particular division, if you call it, that is kind of a triumph of the London office, isn't it?

57:22.050 --> 57:22.570
Absolutely.

57:22.650 --> 57:26.076
So that really does behoove me to pay attention to it.

57:26.116 --> 57:26.496
Yes.

57:27.498 --> 57:35.250
You could not tell the history of the other university press in the last 30 odd years without talking about London.

57:35.530 --> 57:37.573
It was terribly important.

57:37.593 --> 57:40.658
For a while, it was the press's cash cow, and it was

57:40.807 --> 57:49.939
turning back money through this, largely through this successful art publishing program that allowed us to reinvest again and to grow and so on.

57:50.199 --> 57:52.883
And John was a very big partner.

57:53.063 --> 57:54.245
Is he in the UK or is he here?

57:54.265 --> 57:55.146
He's in the UK.

57:56.007 --> 57:59.412
He left the press about two years ago.

57:59.452 --> 58:07.202
He was the, he was called the editor when I came and a few years later I made him the

58:08.482 --> 58:10.784
head of the whole operation over there, the managing director.

58:11.164 --> 58:16.730
And they went on to have a number of very considerable successes and whatnot, and the thing grew and grew and grew.

58:16.790 --> 58:24.697
And John had met a woman at Oxford named Frances Lincoln, and they married.

58:25.037 --> 58:28.761
She had her own publishing company, and it was very successful, a very commercial operation.

58:29.101 --> 58:37.729
And they did lots of illustrated books, children's books and so on, a lot of co-editions.

58:38.080 --> 58:41.425
So he's working with his wife now?

58:42.587 --> 58:44.549
Well, no.

58:45.090 --> 58:45.911
So I'm jumping ahead.

58:46.052 --> 58:57.348
His wife, I think it was four years ago, his wife caught pneumonia and died suddenly when they were up in the Lake District, and he was 54, something like that.

58:57.709 --> 59:05.640
And he was devastated, and then he took over her company, and for a while he ran both

59:06.953 --> 59:11.880
operations, and then he finally pulled out and said he had to devote full time to that company, which he inherited.

59:12.481 --> 59:13.542
He did it again, by the way.

59:14.484 --> 59:30.647
Her company had been very successful, but it had fallen on hard times, and it was deeply in debt, and they had huge staff that they couldn't afford, and the banks were ready to foreclose, and in two years or three years, he turned it around, and it's in the black now.

59:31.048 --> 59:31.969
Boy, a miracle worker.

59:31.989 --> 59:33.171
And he's doing wonderful.

59:33.211 --> 59:34.092
He's a great publisher.

59:34.595 --> 59:36.938
And you people will be able to put me in touch?

59:36.958 --> 59:38.480
Yes, absolutely, yeah.

59:38.540 --> 59:39.922
Because I'll be going either later this year.

59:40.082 --> 59:41.343
Oh, terrific, terrific.

59:41.784 --> 59:42.305
I have to do it.

59:42.325 --> 59:42.985
Yeah, you do.

59:43.146 --> 59:44.567
You could not understand it.

59:44.607 --> 59:50.355
I mean, it is, and there is no other American university press that has anything like it at all.

59:50.375 --> 59:57.143
So the fact that this, that Yale has this major arm that is itself a

59:57.578 --> 01:00:01.104
It's a British publishing company, and it's thought of that way.

01:00:01.124 --> 01:00:05.572
This includes also the books that you put out for the Metropolitan Museum and now the Art Institute of Chicago.

01:00:05.672 --> 01:00:05.852
Yeah.

01:00:06.213 --> 01:00:11.001
Well, a lot of that was, of course, done here, but it was the same idea.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.425
It was following his model.

01:00:15.468 --> 01:00:18.153
Oh, he did so many wonderful things.

01:00:18.173 --> 01:00:21.679
So where did the dedication to the visual come from, or did that just kind of happen?
