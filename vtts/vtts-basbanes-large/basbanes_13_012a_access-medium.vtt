00:05.093 --> 00:20.208
Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler, R-I-T-Z-E-N-T-H-A-L-E-R, Supervisory Conservator at the National Archives.

00:20.328 --> 00:21.329
Supervisory, once again?

00:21.349 --> 00:21.950
Conservator.

00:22.931 --> 00:23.051
Right.

00:23.071 --> 00:26.374
And what else would you like?

00:26.394 --> 00:27.415
Is that it?

00:27.435 --> 00:27.876
Phone number?

00:28.296 --> 00:32.741
Oh, yeah, phone number would be excellent.

00:32.761 --> 00:34.122
301-713-6700, extension

00:34.355 --> 00:36.978
Do you like email?

00:36.998 --> 00:38.340
That's fine, too.

00:38.520 --> 00:38.680
Yeah.

00:39.121 --> 00:52.397
That is MaryLynn, one word, m-a-r-y-l-y-n-n dot Ritzenthaler at ARCH2, A-R-C-H numeral 2, dot NARA, N-A-R-A.

00:52.718 --> 00:54.720
ARCH2, A-R-C-H numeral 2, dot?

00:55.161 --> 01:00.207
NARA, N-A-R-A, dot gov, G-O-V.

01:00.227 --> 01:00.447
Okay, good.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.702
Tell me a little bit, let's start just generally.

01:04.143 --> 01:08.247
You are, it says the four billion pieces of paper are yours.

01:08.267 --> 01:08.548
Is that right?

01:08.568 --> 01:11.271
Well, collectively we share the responsibility.

01:11.731 --> 01:19.120
We have a staff of about 24 people in our unit, which is the Document Conservation Laboratory.

01:20.041 --> 01:31.193
And we consist of conservators, a few chemists, and people in the conservation lab have specialties that range from

01:31.679 --> 01:33.923
primarily paper-based materials.

01:33.963 --> 01:50.470
We have book conservators, and we have one photo conservator, and people who have really spent years working in various media, thinking about how things have been fabricated and what goes wrong when they have not been stored properly or handled properly.

01:51.211 --> 01:54.717
One of the problems faced in the archives, I think, historically has been

01:55.034 --> 01:58.540
the fact that the archives was not established until the mid-1930s.

01:59.281 --> 02:09.017
So the records that we have resided for many, many years in, I guess as people like to say, the attics in the basements of federal agencies around the D.C.

02:09.137 --> 02:13.845
area, oftentimes under conditions that were not very ideal.

02:14.746 --> 02:20.856
And so we have records in our custody that when we received them already had some problems.

02:22.372 --> 02:27.760
How do we decide what comes here and what goes to the Library of Congress?

02:27.780 --> 02:40.761
Well, there are laws, and I'm not the best person to talk about the statutes, but by law, permanent records of federal agencies are supposed to come to the National Archives.

02:40.801 --> 02:47.451
And I'm sure that Susan could refer you to an archivist who could really give you concrete information on that.

02:48.511 --> 03:03.886
Yes, the Library of Congress is really, that's exactly what it is, it's a library, and they, what comes to them are books that are published for, anything that comes to them in manuscript form comes to them as a gift.

03:03.906 --> 03:06.672
There is no law that governs any

03:06.652 --> 03:20.369
coming in and out, so anything that's considered permanently valuable from a federal point of view comes to us, which is only about two percent of everything that's generated by federal government.

03:20.429 --> 03:22.452
What percent of it?

03:22.472 --> 03:22.972
Two percent.

03:22.992 --> 03:30.001
Now, I've been in this vault in the basement of Madisonville, and 18 documents in there, basically all manuscript material.

03:30.021 --> 03:31.663
Shouldn't that be material that would be

03:31.981 --> 03:43.638
But you'd think that that would be material that would be here, you know, thinking of the drafts of the Emexpatient Proclamation, and the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln's First and Seconds, and I'll be able to open it into all of the ages.

03:43.658 --> 03:49.085
There's maybe just one printed book there that the Gutenberg Bible could be developed.

03:49.105 --> 03:53.512
How was it that that material is at the Library of Congress and not here?

03:53.592 --> 03:59.440
I think, in part, by virtue of when the archives was established, there was no federal archive.

03:59.993 --> 04:06.208
And over the years there have been different approaches to different kinds of historical materials, presidential papers.

04:07.772 --> 04:14.509
I think in the 1970s there was a law that was passed that related to

04:14.894 --> 04:20.181
kind of the nature and ultimate custody of presidential materials.

04:20.201 --> 04:26.970
Actually, if you admit, Maryland's right, the law was passed in the 1970s, but it didn't take effect until the beginning of the Reagan administration.

04:26.990 --> 04:37.223
So he's the first president for whom we have papers that actually belong to the federal government of the American people.

04:37.324 --> 04:41.509
Prior to that, presidents donated their papers to us, and so we don't have any inaugural addresses

04:41.489 --> 04:56.450
Well, before Roosevelt, there's a tradition at the beginning of Roosevelt, but prior to that, inaugural address was to be at the Library of Congress, that it could be at a state or a local institution, a university library, or a private board, or destroyed.

04:57.071 --> 05:07.366
And that was one reason why we finally decided that we needed an archive and a presidential library system and the law to govern those papers.

05:07.426 --> 05:08.728
The presidential library system

05:09.046 --> 05:17.096
So you administer all of these presidential libraries?

05:17.116 --> 05:19.278
The archives, yes.

05:19.318 --> 05:28.449
Do you go into a library like the Library of Congress, or Harvard, or the Morgan Library in New York, and you have special collections, rare books?

05:28.469 --> 05:35.037
Do you have criteria here to distinguish rare?

05:35.371 --> 05:45.102
which you consider rare material, the mundane, and the... Well, it's curious that an archive, as you know, since most everything is unique.

05:45.262 --> 05:49.848
Not every little bit, but there is some redundancy on occasion.

05:49.908 --> 05:52.591
But normally, the materials that we have are unique.

05:52.631 --> 05:56.015
They don't exist anywhere else or in any other form.

05:56.535 --> 05:58.718
So from that perspective, our buildings are vaults.

05:59.659 --> 06:05.125
But within that, you're right, there are some things that would be considered top treasures or...

06:05.493 --> 06:28.125
that have special qualities or characteristics, and that would include things that are security classified, that are kept in special areas with special access, and it also includes artifacts, things such as international treaties.

06:31.029 --> 06:31.990
Artifacts on paper.

06:32.712 --> 06:43.464
I think an artifact more likely is considered a three-dimensional object, so it might be a gift to the State Department, for example.

06:43.484 --> 06:44.986
Could be a thing other than a document?

06:45.006 --> 06:45.807
It could be a thing, yes.

06:45.827 --> 06:49.932
We have a lot of weird things at the archives.

06:49.952 --> 06:59.142
Before I put the tape recorder on, we were saying, people wonder, including myself, how would you distinguish between an archivist and a librarian?

06:59.560 --> 07:00.561
And you're an archivist.

07:00.581 --> 07:01.483
No, I'm not actually.

07:01.503 --> 07:02.284
I'm a conservator.

07:02.384 --> 07:03.165
You're a conservator.

07:03.185 --> 07:03.385
Yes.

07:04.227 --> 07:05.228
Another piece in the puzzle.

07:05.248 --> 07:11.497
So you more or less rattle both disciplines, so to speak.

07:11.517 --> 07:15.823
I think you have to be as knowledgeable as you can be, but they're very different spheres.

07:17.045 --> 07:26.158
So I think if you actually have a lot of questions that relate to how materials come into our holdings and the law, I'm not the person to talk to.

07:26.392 --> 07:27.073
Sure.

07:27.093 --> 07:30.978
But in terms of talking about how we care for things— Which is very important.

07:31.939 --> 07:32.079
Yeah.

07:32.179 --> 07:33.821
So let's talk a little bit about that.

07:34.242 --> 07:38.967
Do you also direct preservation efforts?

07:38.987 --> 07:42.111
You mentioned that earlier.

07:42.131 --> 07:44.454
You have the staff, I guess, at 24-3-5-7.

07:44.634 --> 07:44.895
Right.

07:45.015 --> 07:53.445
What we have actually is a preservation program and a director of that program, and then two units that fall under that.

07:53.729 --> 08:03.001
relates to a lot of duplication needs for special media, things such as motion picture films, sound recordings, videotapes.

08:03.061 --> 08:05.324
We do microfilming and still photography.

08:05.344 --> 08:19.241
So the whole range of activities that respond to usually the special physical and chemical needs of non-textual media, things that are not paper-based that we know are going to degrade, that if they're not copied, information will be lost.

08:19.322 --> 08:22.065
So we have many labs in this building devoted to

08:22.535 --> 08:25.038
duplicating records in those formats.

08:25.058 --> 08:28.343
So that's one part of the preservation picture here.

08:29.164 --> 08:37.375
An area I've looked at, and do you have in the National Archives the library equivalent of brittle books?

08:37.815 --> 08:41.460
You know, brittle books, you know, the brittle books from the acidic... Yes, we do.

08:41.620 --> 08:50.432
Although I have always thought that the brittle book programs in libraries, that the issues were somewhat different in archives, that oftentimes, except during

08:50.800 --> 08:52.242
war periods.

08:52.382 --> 08:55.246
In general, the paper quality is probably a little bit better.

08:55.626 --> 08:56.728
During wartime?

08:56.748 --> 08:57.469
No.

08:57.709 --> 08:58.490
During peacetime.

08:58.510 --> 09:03.817
During peacetime, so that we have a lot of poor quality papers generated during wartimes.

09:04.578 --> 09:10.886
But overall, I would not say that our biggest preservation problem is brittle paper.

09:10.906 --> 09:13.610
Does the government mandate the use of nonacetic paper?

09:15.031 --> 09:20.098
There is a law in effect now related to the use of permanent paper by

09:20.416 --> 09:23.959
federal agencies for what are going to become permanent records.

09:24.820 --> 09:28.164
How does one know in advance what record is going to be permanent?

09:28.184 --> 09:33.269
Well, there's certain categories.

09:33.289 --> 09:46.862
And the National Archives has a staff of archivists whose full-time responsibility is essentially working with federal agencies and their records officers and basically scheduling records

09:47.045 --> 09:55.235
Normally, that is done by a series, a category of records, rather than going and looking at individual pieces of paper or individual photographs.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.878
And can I just interject here for a minute?

09:57.898 --> 10:02.043
Generally, this is done even before something is created.

10:02.063 --> 10:09.272
So before a memo is created by Secretary Albright, who we know at the National Archives, is that going to come from that record?

10:09.742 --> 10:13.127
By the nature of her position.

10:13.508 --> 10:23.102
By the nature of who and what it is that she's going to be writing, you know, this memo regarding peace in Afghanistan or, you know, the Ulster TikToks or something like that.

10:23.122 --> 10:28.310
That's already been cited in a schedule some years ago and it's always updated.

10:28.731 --> 10:34.159
So it's not an after the fact thing, although they do that also, but it's really a before the fact thing.

10:34.179 --> 10:36.002
So that's how we know

10:36.252 --> 10:54.071
So there's a code basically that says if you have this level position, then the law says everything you generate as part of your duty is an archive that will be preserved.

10:54.271 --> 11:04.521
And the National Archives provides a lot of guidance to federal agencies on how records should be stored, generated in some cases, what kind of paper is appropriate.

11:04.862 --> 11:06.023
We have even done

11:06.425 --> 11:15.957
guidance on agencies that are creating things in fax form, knowing that sometimes even a fax can become a permanent record.

11:16.017 --> 11:22.485
Probably one of the more curious questions about what is a record are post-it notes.

11:22.505 --> 11:32.938
And a number of years ago, we had inquiry from the White House when President Bush was in office because he loved to slather his presidential papers with the yellow post-it notes.

11:33.425 --> 11:43.299
And the archival staff there knew that that was going to be a preservation issue because they would eventually fall off, and the context would be altered or lost.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.942
So what did you deal with that?

11:44.962 --> 11:51.191
Well, we began testing post-it notes, and we determined a couple of things that the adhesive can be damaging.

11:51.451 --> 11:59.162
If you have media that isn't properly fixed, it can lift off things such as a laser print text that isn't secured.

11:59.834 --> 12:06.401
It can leave behind adhesive residues so papers can stick together or that adhesive will attract dirt and debris.

12:08.523 --> 12:16.812
We offered a couple of possible solutions, including making photocopies of the documents with the post-it notes in situ so you could capture that.

12:18.273 --> 12:24.820
I think the other possibility at that point was using some kind of a fastener to secure them.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.922
But you certainly want

12:27.830 --> 12:34.121
Yes, that's part of the object in the presidential hand.

12:35.603 --> 12:36.665
That's fascinating.

12:36.685 --> 12:44.097
But records keep evolving, and it's a real challenge to keep up with the technology, even the paper technology.

12:44.117 --> 12:47.543
You don't really think of post-its as part of the electronic age.

12:48.147 --> 12:49.369
They have an impact.

12:49.389 --> 12:51.553
So what did you finally do?

12:51.613 --> 12:56.421
We just offered some solutions, and I'm not sure what options they followed.

12:56.441 --> 12:59.205
And this is while his presidency was a work in progress.

12:59.225 --> 12:59.987
Exactly.

13:00.007 --> 13:00.427
Yeah.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.913
Now, will all that material now go to the Bush Library?

13:04.354 --> 13:04.514
Mm-hmm.

13:04.614 --> 13:06.177
Or probably he's already there.

13:06.197 --> 13:06.337
Mm-hmm.

13:06.357 --> 13:09.002
Right.

13:09.022 --> 13:13.429
So the staff down there is undoubtedly dealing with it.

13:15.974 --> 13:19.182
Will the guidelines be something I can gather, if you think?

13:19.202 --> 13:21.468
You can get anything you want?

13:21.488 --> 13:25.358
I mean, I'd love to see the guidelines that you... Oh, that's what's proposed?

13:25.378 --> 13:26.741
Well, not just proposed.

13:26.802 --> 13:29.308
The general guidelines that you issue to federal...

13:29.677 --> 13:36.067
on the type of paper that they should use and the precautions they should use.

13:36.688 --> 13:37.870
I can gather them together.

13:37.910 --> 13:40.334
That would be great.

13:41.436 --> 13:42.657
I'm using them.

13:43.278 --> 13:47.225
The trick is to make this interesting for the general reader.

13:47.545 --> 13:51.571
The electronic element.

13:51.652 --> 13:52.914
Oh, no, before we get to that.

13:53.274 --> 13:55.718
Okay, that's fine.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.381
That's good.

13:57.722 --> 13:58.443
Yes, that's very good.

14:00.065 --> 14:01.887
You don't mind that one.

14:01.907 --> 14:06.674
Yeah, but this is a very interesting question, because it is an issue that I'm encountering.

14:06.694 --> 14:18.950
And we just recently, a few months ago, saw an item in the New Yorker about the pamphlets that they had microfilmed and then the accessions.

14:19.611 --> 14:24.017
Actually, because they had to cut them up to do proper microfilming.

14:24.554 --> 14:28.801
And then they were sold a book dealer, blah, blah, blah.

14:28.821 --> 14:40.118
This is a long way of saying that for many, many years, and even today, it continues to be the fact that microfilming is considered a means of preservation.

14:41.139 --> 14:42.161
And is that the case here?

14:42.181 --> 14:43.463
That's a long question.

14:43.483 --> 14:43.723
Yes.

14:44.645 --> 14:51.996
Actually, I think it's probably one of the few enduring formats that we have available to us right now.

14:52.415 --> 15:05.528
There are national standards that govern how microfilm is created, how it's processed, how the master film is stored, and there is a track record for stable photographic film.

15:08.130 --> 15:19.861
And if you have a deteriorating artifact piece of tape and you microfilm it, do you still keep the original?

15:19.881 --> 15:20.582
Yes, we do.

15:21.372 --> 15:24.037
even if it's falling apart.

15:24.097 --> 15:29.367
Unless you determine that you have a true archival microfilm copy, do you still keep it?

15:29.387 --> 15:31.090
Typically that is the case.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.514
We have done lots and lots of microfilming over the years.

15:33.554 --> 15:38.744
I'm not aware of any instance where the archives has disposed of microfilmed records.

15:38.764 --> 15:43.212
There's always that chance that perhaps the film did not capture everything.

15:43.552 --> 15:44.494
I think that's part of it.

15:45.132 --> 15:58.807
I think if you were really going to start disposing of records, you would have to be able to do 100% verification of content, which, as you can imagine, would be enormously expensive.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.148
And we simply can't do that.

16:00.589 --> 16:02.290
So there's kind of that fail-safe.

16:02.471 --> 16:08.037
We have the original records that are withheld from use, so they're not going to get any worse, typically.

16:08.617 --> 16:11.140
And we have the microfilms that researchers can use.

16:11.356 --> 16:19.143
How about digital means as a preservation option?

16:19.163 --> 16:19.804
Do you do that as well?

16:20.324 --> 16:22.006
We do digitize records.

16:22.066 --> 16:25.609
I think at this point at the Archives, that is considered an access tool.

16:26.169 --> 16:37.680
It probably has some preservation benefits in that as we have more materials digitized, that will be another way of limiting handling of original records.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.962
But it is not being done at this point.

16:40.398 --> 16:41.820
for preservation purposes.

16:41.840 --> 16:55.938
And I think that's probably one of the dichotomies in the whole field right now are the differences between institutions who are seeing it as the preservation mechanism versus those who see it as access.

16:56.199 --> 17:03.068
Cornel, I mentioned earlier that they are really, I'm sure you were there, cutting edge.

17:03.108 --> 17:03.929
Yes, definitely.

17:04.229 --> 17:10.337
And in some instances, while I was there, they were scanning

17:10.621 --> 17:14.808
the outgoing correspondence of Ezra Cornell, whom the institution was named.

17:15.229 --> 17:16.691
Not in his hand, but it's early.

17:16.711 --> 17:19.556
You know, it's pre-carbon paper, carbon paper, that precious stuff.

17:19.776 --> 17:24.885
And so they had determined that these copies had no artifactual value.

17:24.905 --> 17:26.667
The value was strictly the content.

17:27.629 --> 17:33.018
And so I said, well, what are you going to do with these volumes when you finish copying them?

17:33.038 --> 17:34.300
And they said, disposable.

17:34.550 --> 17:37.634
That's not something that would ever happen here, I guess.

17:37.654 --> 17:44.342
We have federal laws that preclude that option, really.

17:44.803 --> 17:50.430
I mean, we're really in the business of permanently keeping records.

17:51.011 --> 17:56.197
And the record is actually what was created in whatever form it was created.

17:56.217 --> 17:56.698
It was created on paper.

17:56.798 --> 17:57.439
That's the actual record.

17:57.459 --> 18:03.426
Now, as Mary Lynn said, we do lots of things for preservation and access reasons, but in terms of what comes in here is what is the individual record.

18:03.406 --> 18:11.295
That's a very key point, I have to say.

18:11.315 --> 18:31.658
Also, then you have backup to this whole question of migration, you know, when you talk about digital

18:31.942 --> 18:40.193
It's incredibly expensive to think about the long-term financial obligation to keep migrating digital information forward.

18:40.834 --> 18:41.615
Is that Ken Thibodeau?

18:41.695 --> 18:42.957
Who am I going to make it for?

18:42.977 --> 18:43.538
We'll talk about that.

18:43.558 --> 18:44.179
Oh, good.

18:44.199 --> 18:44.399
Oh, good.

18:45.961 --> 18:48.725
Much easier to keep your master microfilm in a cave.

18:49.827 --> 18:50.047
Yeah.

18:51.188 --> 18:52.230
Cheaper over the long run.

18:52.610 --> 18:53.291
At least right now.

18:53.311 --> 18:55.935
But microfilm is actually a very reliable thing.

18:56.316 --> 18:56.816
It is.

18:57.377 --> 18:58.799
It started back in the 30s.

18:58.819 --> 19:01.763
There was 20 prep probably even earlier than that.

19:02.620 --> 19:07.365
We'll discuss that, the digital stuff.

19:10.328 --> 19:16.574
But once you get rid of that original document, you had better be sure that you constantly migrate.

19:17.735 --> 19:23.360
And I guess you do have a policy here, and we'll discuss that, of refreshing your material.

19:24.542 --> 19:27.625
There's also the issue of what is human versus machine readable.

19:27.765 --> 19:30.147
And I think a lot of the microfilming that we do

19:30.565 --> 19:34.832
is actually human readable with just a magnifying glass.

19:37.717 --> 19:39.740
So really you deal with the paper stuff.

19:40.241 --> 19:49.637
You don't deal with the— Well, paper and photos and graphic materials, things like posters and architectural drawings and maps and a whole— But not electronic?

19:49.877 --> 19:52.101
Everything but electronic, basically.

19:53.093 --> 20:16.124
I think part of that gets back to the question that you raised about relative values.

20:16.204 --> 20:21.852
Is everything co-equal because it's here in the archives, or do we treat some things differently?

20:22.287 --> 20:39.270
We work very closely with the custodial archival staff to make decisions every year about what we're going to spend time treating, and the kinds of factors that we consider will include the relative value, knowing that there are such things.

20:40.191 --> 20:50.826
A concept that is in use here is something called intrinsic value, and that relates to somewhat intangible issues that are applied

20:51.160 --> 20:56.286
a series of criteria to determine the intrinsic value.

20:56.326 --> 20:57.307
Is that codified?

20:57.487 --> 20:57.928
Is that something?

20:57.948 --> 20:58.649
It is, actually.

20:58.689 --> 21:00.191
We have a for sure.

21:00.211 --> 21:02.133
I'd love to see something on that.

21:02.153 --> 21:02.273
Okay.

21:02.293 --> 21:05.016
I can get you a copy if you don't have one.

21:05.036 --> 21:05.136
Okay.

21:05.156 --> 21:06.598
That would be very useful.

21:06.618 --> 21:06.718
Okay.

21:06.758 --> 21:14.147
But one of the other important things that we think about is use, because we know that it's at the point of use that records are really in jeopardy.

21:14.167 --> 21:19.193
Since we store them in environmentally controlled buildings with good housing,

21:19.628 --> 21:23.854
If they're simply resting on shelves, there's not a whole lot that can go wrong.

21:24.455 --> 21:35.311
So it's that interface between either a lot of use and handling by staff or researchers that will up the ante in terms of things requiring laboratory attention.

21:36.813 --> 21:38.696
How much volume can you do in a year?

21:39.898 --> 21:49.011
I mean, I've got members from the Library of Congress taking the next number of books they've staffed, and they go through kind of a triage thing, which I think is what you're describing.

21:49.345 --> 21:56.532
determine intrinsic value, I guess, but you also take into account how desperately the object needs the intervention.

21:56.832 --> 21:57.133
Right.

21:57.153 --> 22:04.700
And then you get input from all the different divisions or departments, and they say, well, look, we have this that needs to be done.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.841
Everybody says that.

22:05.861 --> 22:09.865
And then you have to make a determination, I guess, on what you can do.

22:10.145 --> 22:11.567
How much can you do?

22:11.587 --> 22:17.833
Well, for example, this year we are going to be treating 5,000 roll documents from

22:18.168 --> 22:19.449
our cartographic branch.

22:20.030 --> 22:25.315
These documents were rolled probably shortly after they were created.

22:25.335 --> 22:31.661
They've been with us for some time, and they can't really be handled until they receive conservation treatment.

22:32.501 --> 22:36.225
And once they're flat, then they can be described and then used by researchers.

22:36.705 --> 22:45.053
We had a similar project with rolled materials with rolled panorama photographs, and we had about 3,000 of those that simply were

22:45.657 --> 22:47.219
have enrolled for decades.

22:47.679 --> 22:56.750
Nobody knew what the images were, and we had a project that lasted for about two years to systematically go through and humidify flatten and then treat.

22:56.790 --> 22:59.113
Where did they come in from?

22:59.153 --> 23:01.897
A wide variety of agencies, but a lot from the military.

23:02.457 --> 23:06.322
The Army seemed to like these special circuit cameras.

23:07.984 --> 23:15.613
And so then you were given custody of these things already, I guess, in a distressed state.

23:15.863 --> 23:16.884
Right, yes.

23:16.904 --> 23:18.586
When the archives received them, they were enrolled.

23:19.867 --> 23:23.731
So then you made it a priority.

23:23.791 --> 23:25.913
How did it come out?

23:25.933 --> 23:27.314
Yes.

23:27.334 --> 23:34.742
In fact, we have an exhibit downstairs of some selected panoramic images that were treated during this process.

23:34.782 --> 23:44.892
This was a priority for the archival staff, so they raised it with conservation as a need that they saw because they simply did not have access to those records.

23:45.648 --> 23:47.330
What would you say is the greatest?

23:47.570 --> 23:54.537
Is there any particular urgency for any kinds of documents that they need yet?

23:55.719 --> 24:11.816
Probably one of the biggest areas relates to film-based materials, and Susan mentioned that we've had problems that at this point are kind of historical with nitrate film, but the big problem at the moment are acetate films.

24:11.876 --> 24:13.157
The precursor

24:13.964 --> 24:28.203
basically to the contemporary safety films that we're using now that are largely polyester-based, but the cellulose diacetate films that have problems with the base shrinking, the emulsion then cockling and buckling.

24:29.104 --> 24:36.755
And if you don't capture and make copies of these things before they start going through that physical change, you lose information.

24:37.215 --> 24:42.823
And we have millions of acetate negatives from all departments.

24:43.124 --> 25:03.331
And it's a problem that actually crosses custodial lines because you think of still photos as having an acetate problem, but in our cartographic holdings there are a lot of plastic overlays that are used with maps, and those are acetate plaps and such, and those also are subject to the same kind of degradation.

25:03.671 --> 25:07.676
So there can be loss wherever that kind of material is found.

25:08.517 --> 25:09.499
How about magnetic tape?

25:10.220 --> 25:12.102
Is that something you deal with?

25:12.773 --> 25:19.926
the archives deals with it in terms of basically duplicating such things as sound and video recording.

25:20.968 --> 25:35.676
Any primary material like the JPL, for instance, the Viking data, which was originally stored on magnetic tape, and they're finding that tragically a lot of that material hasn't held up because of the

25:36.078 --> 25:38.201
the nature of the medium itself.

25:38.221 --> 25:40.643
Yeah, I'm not sure that we have custody of that or not.

25:40.663 --> 25:45.990
No, I don't think so, but that's the stuff that can deal with that.

25:46.010 --> 25:54.199
You know, that's what he worries about, is migrating stuff also.

25:54.219 --> 25:54.920
And I hope we've got that together.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.742
Do you want to take a look around the lounge?

25:56.782 --> 26:02.389
Yeah, sure.

26:04.529 --> 26:10.304
They are fully equipped with the pupus and things.

26:10.324 --> 26:10.805
This is a wet treatment.

26:10.825 --> 26:12.008
Spotless suit.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.532
Yes.

26:13.552 --> 26:16.058
I must say.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.145
And this facility, is it open for five years?

26:26.087 --> 26:31.137
We've been in residence at the beginning of about four years ago.

26:31.277 --> 26:42.740
It took a while to get everybody... It said 1985 and the steel out there at the front, so that must be when they started that.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.644
How would you describe that?

26:45.620 --> 26:52.468
What would you compare it to?

26:52.608 --> 26:53.649
It really is.

26:53.689 --> 26:58.675
It's the largest archival facility in the world, isn't it?

26:58.695 --> 26:59.516
I think so.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.018
I don't know how many churches.

27:01.038 --> 27:05.924
I used to know, you know, I used to roll right off my tongue, but it's gone now.

27:05.944 --> 27:09.147
I mean, when the building turned up, you know, 500 miles.

27:12.231 --> 27:12.471
500 miles?

27:12.491 --> 27:13.973
Is this not one building, by the way?

27:14.138 --> 27:17.043
Yes, it is.

27:17.063 --> 27:28.002
So this is another lab comparable in size to the one that we received now.

27:28.022 --> 27:32.209
There are a lot of interesting projects going on, including this one.

27:32.229 --> 27:39.842
This is Sarah Wagner, who is our photo conservator, and she's looking actually on one of the

27:40.092 --> 27:46.739
the groups of records that are considered to be photographic treasures of the National Archives.

27:46.759 --> 28:03.236
I don't know if you have anything that you can show us there that is an image that you have acceptable.

28:03.256 --> 28:04.497
When researchers come,

28:05.033 --> 28:06.895
Do you hope that they'll use microfilm?

28:07.256 --> 28:12.021
Well, they can't on most of our stuff because very little of it is microfilm, really.

28:12.622 --> 28:19.230
What, what, Mary Lynn, is it 10% of our Holy John Lecture?

28:19.250 --> 28:19.570
10%?

28:19.971 --> 28:20.812
I think so.

28:22.153 --> 28:26.498
And that, I mean, as Mary Lynn said, we try to select our heavily used records.

28:26.518 --> 28:27.720
I mean, that's one criteria.

28:27.860 --> 28:33.927
So all of our census materials are... Civil War?

28:34.379 --> 28:41.250
These are Gardner and Bernard's vintage photographs.

28:41.470 --> 28:49.643
And what Sarah is involved in doing is removing the photo and if there's a caption on the back from the original mount.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.528
And you can see the difference kind of before and after.

28:54.050 --> 28:54.150
Wow.

28:54.271 --> 28:58.277
And these are kind of— The board is— Sigma Core Photo Laboratory.

28:59.540 --> 29:00.862
Oh, can I take a picture?

29:00.882 --> 29:01.282
Do you mind?

29:01.302 --> 29:02.724
Is that something I can or I can't do?

29:09.713 --> 29:20.826
And this is, by the way, two signatures of photos in my book, so I've taken hundreds of photographs, but this really just helps me, and I won't use a flash.

29:20.846 --> 29:27.094
I've got the date right on there, which is great.

29:27.114 --> 29:27.775
1664.

29:29.932 --> 29:53.719
It could be used in a book.

29:54.439 --> 29:59.365
Oh, I'll write it.

30:04.880 --> 30:09.585
You could have used a flash on me.

30:09.925 --> 30:11.667
Well, actually, this is because it's available light.

30:11.687 --> 30:12.187
This is nice.

30:12.408 --> 30:13.729
It's actually very good.

30:13.869 --> 30:13.989
Yeah.

30:14.009 --> 30:23.359
But I mentioned the project to flatten the panoramas, and that's the project that Sarah was responsible for, which was a very large project over several years.

30:23.479 --> 30:25.521
I sure like the little object below, too.

30:25.621 --> 30:30.186
That was fine.

30:30.406 --> 30:32.608
I got a sense of the mask.

30:32.858 --> 30:33.960
No, no.

30:34.120 --> 30:39.008
I like the side.

30:39.028 --> 30:40.290
You can work.

30:40.810 --> 30:45.418
I don't have anything to do.

30:45.438 --> 30:49.464
Thanks.

30:49.484 --> 30:50.606
Okay.

30:50.886 --> 30:52.048
Thank you, Sarah.

30:57.496 --> 31:01.124
Hello.

31:01.745 --> 31:02.126
Hi.

31:02.226 --> 31:03.128
How are you?

31:03.188 --> 31:07.096
This is Miranda Martin.

31:08.719 --> 31:09.240
Hello.

31:09.260 --> 31:10.543
And she's actually working on a map, yes.

31:10.563 --> 31:15.253
And this might be some of the same time period of this photo.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.796
Really?

31:16.816 --> 31:16.916
Yeah.

31:16.936 --> 31:17.277
Your eligibility.

31:17.881 --> 31:18.662
I'm sorry?

31:18.782 --> 31:20.043
I'm sorry, your name is?

31:20.063 --> 31:22.205
Yeah, I'm Nicholas Basden, B-A-S-B-A-N.

31:22.225 --> 31:24.287
And where are you from, Mr. Basden?

31:24.427 --> 31:34.716
I'm from Massachusetts, and I'm working on a book on archives and libraries and book culture and all kinds of things, and I'm a present agent.

31:34.736 --> 31:47.567
Yeah, this is a map from a series of maps run by...

31:47.699 --> 32:06.921
The reason that this is particularly valuable is because it's got the manuscript annotations, the colored annotations.

32:08.443 --> 32:15.951
Evidently the red are occupied for it, the blue are unoccupied for it, and there isn't a key for all the other colors.

32:16.319 --> 32:21.266
It has had a process done to it, which is called silky.

32:21.286 --> 32:25.433
And this is pretty common at the end of the last entry, beginning of this.

32:26.054 --> 32:28.277
And it's actually a very thin layer of silk.

32:28.297 --> 32:29.939
You can see what it looks like here.

32:30.761 --> 32:41.116
And it was glued to the mat, very much the way lamination would be later to hold something that was falling apart together.

32:41.417 --> 32:44.301
And the silk becomes brittle.

32:44.753 --> 32:47.396
probably a lettuce silk, it's extremely acidic.

32:48.917 --> 32:51.920
It really is terrible for the paper.

32:52.381 --> 32:56.264
And this one is also backed with canvas.

32:59.788 --> 33:10.018
And the amount of time that would have taken me to get the filtering off, which is what we would ideally like to have done, was so great considering there are other copies of this map.

33:10.606 --> 33:13.409
that they ask me simply to stabilize it.

33:13.569 --> 33:27.865
So there are areas where the silking is pulling the paper together and so I'm cutting it in those areas and I'll flatten it so it'll be easier to read and I'll encapsulate it with a stiffener behind it so it'll be vandalable.

33:28.726 --> 33:32.991
And that's the kind of decision you have to make in a collection like this.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.735
You want somebody to spend weeks on something.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.757
How much time are you spending on this?

33:39.040 --> 33:43.266
In the end, I'm hoping to be able to finish in about 40 hours.

33:43.587 --> 33:50.878
I've already spent about 30 hours examining the math as part of the documentation process.

33:50.898 --> 33:54.784
And it was at the end of that process that I said, I'm not going to be able to do this as fast as I thought I was.

33:55.465 --> 34:03.517
And at that point, we went back to the curators and said, gee, I really thought I was going to be able to do this in a couple of weeks, and I can't.

34:03.537 --> 34:07.984
So given that information, do you want me to go and still do some

34:08.251 --> 34:13.337
big treatment and now take a lot of time, or do you want me to do a much more minor treatment?

34:13.578 --> 34:17.082
And basically we make it so we can handle it.

34:17.703 --> 34:19.725
And what again, is it a map of, did you say?

34:19.745 --> 34:22.268
It's a map of the Western United States territory.

34:22.288 --> 34:30.278
And despite the fact that there are other conferences that this is the uniqueness, the annotations on this are unique.

34:30.559 --> 34:34.123
So it still is of great interest.

34:34.424 --> 34:38.168
And which department of the government did it come in from, do you think?

34:38.188 --> 34:48.981
The military is like that.

34:49.001 --> 34:49.101
Army.

34:49.121 --> 34:49.221
Army.

34:49.241 --> 34:49.361
Great.

34:49.381 --> 34:49.581
Thank you.

34:49.601 --> 35:00.133
It's great.

35:00.153 --> 35:00.414
Thanks a lot.

35:00.434 --> 35:00.634
Thank you.

35:05.423 --> 35:15.861
I would like to show you a little bit of one of the larger .

35:15.981 --> 35:16.282
Wow.

35:16.322 --> 35:22.632
That looks like a lithographic.

35:22.653 --> 35:28.402
Do you think that's lithographic?

35:28.543 --> 35:29.324
Yes, it is.

35:29.665 --> 35:29.965
Wow.

35:29.985 --> 35:31.127
These are a series

35:38.954 --> 35:39.915
How are these stores?

35:39.935 --> 35:53.189
Do you have, actually, facilities that... Well, I wanted to show you the housing that we're making today, and maybe just looking briefly and talking about it in a tent of... Oh, he's crazy.

35:56.793 --> 35:59.756
They're really quite amazing.

35:59.776 --> 36:01.277
They really are.

36:02.839 --> 36:08.505
...in the series of three or four panels that we have been, almost like a building, to form the work in

36:10.240 --> 36:15.188
Yeah, these came to the lab and just all folded up and rolled.

36:15.929 --> 36:24.221
And very luckily, the archivist that saw them for the challenge that they were had handled.

36:24.241 --> 36:29.770
So basically, from the time they were transferred from the Army to the archives, they had not been accessed.

36:29.790 --> 36:37.902
So it's been a very big challenge for us to get them to the point that we could begin even to see what they were and how they were created.

36:38.202 --> 36:43.729
Were they a billboard, do you figure?

36:43.749 --> 36:46.753
There's a series of panels.

36:46.853 --> 37:00.852
Each of the units is composed typically of three pieces of paper that's joined together, so that each would have been printed separately as a little part of the panel, joined together, and then these larger units together.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.555
I wouldn't have read the presence of mind to preserve this.

37:04.736 --> 37:07.520
It almost seems like an ephemeral object, doesn't it?

37:07.680 --> 37:08.421
I think you're right.

37:09.161 --> 37:13.567
It's probably very few of these that it's here.

37:13.587 --> 37:16.410
What do you think?

37:16.430 --> 37:19.213
It's World War I era?

37:19.233 --> 37:25.000
World War I. The spurs kind of give it away.

37:25.020 --> 37:25.841
But they're beautiful.

37:25.921 --> 37:27.463
I love lithographs.

37:31.257 --> 37:56.911
Are there other?

37:56.931 --> 37:57.552
We have two different managers.

37:58.207 --> 38:23.623
A-L-A-N-E-L-A.

38:24.532 --> 38:52.851
um there is one poster that is um disassembled um and this is the housing for that one poster the posters we were just looking at actually of a neighbor if you'd like to see that we can show it to you if you want an overall complete image but um what we had to do was to determine whether or not

38:53.101 --> 39:04.092
there was sufficient space up in the stack area to accommodate flat storage because we knew that we didn't want to re-roll the .

39:04.172 --> 39:20.728
And then to come up with a system so that it could be transported through the building and returned in a flat format and also photographed so that we have access to the image for researchers without any future handling.

39:21.940 --> 39:27.985
So the materials that Alan is using, you can see the profile of this board, which looks like a honeycomb.

39:28.486 --> 39:34.671
It's called picor, and it's a paper honeycomb that is spaced with strong paper.

39:34.691 --> 39:43.339
So it's very rigid and lightweight, and still can be pieced together to whatever size you would need.

39:43.919 --> 39:45.161
Alan, what are the dimensions here?

39:45.181 --> 39:47.803
Would you estimate about 12 feet by 10 feet?

39:48.303 --> 39:50.225
That is my guess.

39:50.385 --> 39:51.306
9 feet is 9 feet.

39:51.995 --> 39:58.405
So where do you keep something like this permanently?

39:58.425 --> 39:59.626
Do you keep it in this housing?

39:59.787 --> 40:03.592
Do you have a space that will accommodate that?

40:03.612 --> 40:06.637
It will be in this one item in this housing.

40:07.278 --> 40:13.427
We'll have a lid that will be strapped on and it will be kept on the top of map cases up in our still picture branch.

40:14.388 --> 40:18.154
We don't have a drawer big enough for it, but with several map cases

40:18.539 --> 40:19.680
butted together.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.262
We have enough space that's flat.

40:21.282 --> 40:25.226
So somebody has made a determination that this particular artifact is very important.

40:25.246 --> 40:25.547
Yes.

40:25.567 --> 40:29.852
Because you are committing a lot of very valuable real estate to it.

40:29.872 --> 40:30.032
Exactly.

40:30.172 --> 40:30.993
Aren't you?

40:31.033 --> 40:33.536
Not to mention the resources to treat it.

40:33.876 --> 40:38.641
The treatise to houses, the photography has been quite amazing as well.

40:41.284 --> 40:42.586
But it's unique to our holding.

40:43.267 --> 40:43.647
Oh, it is.

40:43.767 --> 40:45.069
That's important.

40:45.249 --> 40:48.192
And we also believe that they are very

40:48.526 --> 40:51.330
scarce, if not unique, in the world.

40:51.350 --> 40:57.398
Well, I've seen where posters go far at options, and I can agree, and I've never seen anything quite like this.

40:57.418 --> 41:06.611
Now, what if I'm a scholar doing an article or a book on social history, and I want to study these.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.554
Are you going to bring this out to me in the reading room?

41:08.874 --> 41:12.619
Unfortunately for you.

41:12.639 --> 41:13.681
I know it's a silly question.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.384
No, it isn't really.

41:16.404 --> 41:18.347
We have actually a very wonderful graphic

41:18.732 --> 41:20.735
collection of posters.

41:21.457 --> 41:32.776
And what we have done is basically provided slides and there's a collection of those slides in the reading room so that researchers access the images via that tool.

41:33.297 --> 41:37.264
So for this particular artifact, this falls into the 10% which has been

41:37.649 --> 41:48.548
photographs or microfilmed or whatever, and I assume that the photographs are true color reproductions, so you would hope that that satisfies the curiosity of the scholar, right?

41:48.788 --> 41:48.928
Right.

41:48.949 --> 41:56.241
We did color transparency with these, and from the transparencies we will make slides.

41:56.802 --> 42:00.248
And the other thing that we're doing with this, and this is the access angle

42:00.650 --> 42:09.117
is to take the transparencies of these multiple panels and then digitally put them together to form a complete image.

42:09.598 --> 42:21.248
So then we can have output from that that will be something that researchers and others can use as their access to this information.

42:21.268 --> 42:29.695
And sometimes, I'm not saying that it would occur with this because probably it wouldn't, but unique items that are so-called retired

42:29.962 --> 42:51.345
scholars and others who only have access through lodge or whatever might still be taken out to be put on exhibit you know on a rare occasion but somewhat the treaty it is obviously available in printed form and that's the way most people would read it we would still use those treaties for exhibitions and other purposes

42:51.629 --> 42:56.938
And there have been times, and in fact, I can look at one treaty in particular, in which a judge wanted to come.

42:56.979 --> 43:02.889
In fact, he traveled all the way to Washington from Texas to see a particular treaty.

43:02.909 --> 43:13.468
I mean, in public law, I don't know what time it was signed, because there was some sort of case that he had in Texas, and there was a time difference of when the law was passed, and he wanted to make sure

43:14.208 --> 43:30.619
the case that he had at the time that had been committed that happened before, after that particular time, he had to come to see the original law because the time that the sign was on there and it wasn't on the need of printed copies.

43:30.639 --> 43:36.250
So there are reasons beyond the intrinsic value to keep these, you know, unique items.

43:36.652 --> 43:48.827
And very recently, speaking of treaties, we had members of the Navajo Nation coming to Washington because they wanted to see the treaties.

43:48.867 --> 43:51.690
Do the Native American tribes have their own archives?

43:52.752 --> 43:55.976
There are some, I believe, yes.

43:56.036 --> 44:06.068
And actually there's a publication that was put out by the Society of American Archivists on, I forget the title, but it's on Native American archives and how to establish such.

44:06.419 --> 44:07.961
Society of American Archivists?

44:07.981 --> 44:13.206
They're located in Chicago, comparable to the American Library Association.

44:13.226 --> 44:14.747
It's quite different.

44:14.767 --> 44:15.688
Also in Chicago?

44:15.908 --> 44:16.949
Yes, that's right.

44:18.010 --> 44:24.256
And they did an article on... No, they did a manual, basically, directed towards people who wanted to establish tribal archives.

44:29.462 --> 44:30.342
Very important thing.

44:31.183 --> 44:36.088
I'm mostly doing a chapter on emigrate and exile libraries.

44:37.030 --> 44:54.160
the Cambodian people who were killed, of course, with all the books and the records, and I'm doing something on Sarajevo and Tibet, you know, and also historically, but also today.

44:54.180 --> 44:58.448
So things like that, my life flashed.

44:58.698 --> 44:59.719
Did you want to do that?

44:59.959 --> 45:01.101
I'd love to, yes.

45:01.702 --> 45:09.190
Alan, could we stick over?

45:09.210 --> 45:09.511
Thank you.

45:09.531 --> 45:09.711
Thanks.

45:09.731 --> 45:11.333
Alan, how do you do that?

45:11.753 --> 45:17.260
Alan, how do you do that?

45:17.280 --> 45:19.963
Alan, how do you do that?

45:24.820 --> 45:46.082
Oh, that's fantastic.

45:46.102 --> 45:46.683
That's going into the houses?

45:46.703 --> 45:47.404
That's going into that large house.

45:47.424 --> 45:48.044
Do you know a colonel for this?

45:48.064 --> 45:48.965
Do you know where it came from, where it was?

45:48.985 --> 45:49.065
Yes.

45:49.085 --> 45:49.486
Records of the Army.

45:49.506 --> 45:49.846
So you have that?

45:49.866 --> 45:50.267
Records of the Army.

45:50.287 --> 45:50.727
That is really simple.

45:52.748 --> 46:13.079
That's interesting.

46:13.099 --> 46:17.626
Part of the problem with the treatment of these folks is the fact that when the individual sheep are joined together, they reside in the way that the people are dressed and so they have to do with most things in the community.

46:17.646 --> 46:18.908
So there is kind of a very much more compared to a similar way.

46:18.888 --> 46:28.670
Is it something that just recently came to you?

46:29.451 --> 46:30.935
Yes.

46:30.955 --> 46:34.062
Or is it something that you've had for a while?

46:34.142 --> 46:38.331
It's been at the Archives for kind of my time, and it was in the text profile.

46:40.201 --> 47:03.612
What is the only one that says to the other one?

47:03.632 --> 47:04.453
The other one that says to the other one.

47:05.446 --> 47:07.770
I was just wondering.

47:07.790 --> 47:08.832
We didn't want them to.

47:08.912 --> 47:11.576
I was just going to say, I bet you didn't want them to.

47:11.596 --> 47:21.913
Susan was mentioning the possibility of exhibition, and I think it is unlikely that they will ever be exhibited in original format because I don't think that they will fit into our exhibit gallery.

47:21.933 --> 47:25.719
Yeah, you know, I was thinking about that, but you guys really lucked out on that.

47:26.781 --> 47:28.163
So there's an exhibit gallery here?

47:28.295 --> 47:31.398
Oh, downtown.

47:34.141 --> 47:39.967
We have periodic visits here, but only of non-originals.

47:42.950 --> 47:53.440
So the housing will incorporate these little support groups so that the paper won't structure or collapse.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.062
That has to be quite a challenging

47:55.447 --> 48:02.056
because you don't want to tack it, you don't want to put any holes in it, you don't want to adhere it with any kind of adhesive.

48:03.278 --> 48:17.117
And how do you do it without, you know...

48:29.011 --> 48:36.882
the breadth of our photo collection, for example, we have over 7 million photos in the archives.

48:36.922 --> 48:40.827
Look at this, this is easier than a football field.

48:40.847 --> 48:41.028
Oh, yeah.

48:41.048 --> 48:45.374
I think it's the second largest building, I mean, several building in the Pentagon.

48:45.394 --> 48:46.816
This is, the Pentagon is larger?

48:46.956 --> 48:51.102
I think so.

48:51.182 --> 48:52.123
Those five rings.

48:52.664 --> 48:55.828
But this is enormous.

48:56.112 --> 49:00.440
I didn't know this.

49:00.600 --> 49:18.272
Why isn't it a federal library?

49:18.337 --> 49:23.023
Well, it's a long and complicated and it's not a boring story.

49:23.063 --> 49:25.767
I could probably point it in LexisNexis, right?

49:25.907 --> 49:27.409
It's a lawsuit.

49:27.489 --> 49:30.413
The ongoing students relating to Nixon.

49:30.473 --> 49:31.735
The tapes and stuff.

49:31.755 --> 49:40.567
The White House who wanted to take his tapes with him because prior to Nixon's president had custody over there on the sheriff and he donated them to the federal government.

49:40.587 --> 49:43.932
There was a Supreme Court law that was just for the Nixon papers.

49:44.012 --> 49:47.837
It said that these papers really were the property of the federal government.

49:48.273 --> 49:53.642
And in fact, we're now involved in another issue.

49:53.662 --> 49:54.503
With Nixon's people?

49:54.864 --> 50:00.654
Yes, about him being compensated for that paper.

50:00.674 --> 50:02.737
How can he be compensated?

50:02.757 --> 50:04.660
He was a federal employee when they were generated.

50:04.741 --> 50:14.176
Well, that's true, but there was no law at the time, and there weren't been noted because the president could keep their papers.

50:14.196 --> 50:14.517
So he kept them.

50:15.526 --> 50:24.620
While the Supreme Court said that they did, in fact, want us, it was also decided in the Court of Appeals that, in fact, we should be compensated for the taking such as papers.

50:24.680 --> 50:29.308
So we're just about to go to trial to determine what the worth of the papers are.

50:29.328 --> 50:30.870
Calvin, how are you?

50:30.930 --> 50:33.134
This is Calvin Jefferson.

50:33.154 --> 50:33.835
Yes, how are you?

50:33.855 --> 50:34.355
How are you?

50:34.375 --> 50:34.776
Thank you.

50:34.796 --> 50:40.565
Calvin is our supervisory archivist who's really in charge of all this user services research room.

50:40.585 --> 50:42.428
So he's going to do a good tour of the building.

50:42.728 --> 50:44.930
And just so you know, I'm taping, okay?

50:45.070 --> 50:45.811
It's just taping?

50:46.311 --> 50:47.292
I'm getting taped.

50:47.312 --> 50:50.195
If you don't, if you want me to just check it off, I will, but it just helps me.

50:52.477 --> 50:57.781
We'll start here because he needs to know exactly how we get researchers here and everything.

50:58.022 --> 50:58.282
Right, right.

50:58.302 --> 50:58.542
Okay.

50:59.363 --> 51:02.726
When researchers first come into the National Archives, this is the first time.

51:03.386 --> 51:07.210
When they come in here, we will ask the researcher, what kind of research are you doing?

51:07.270 --> 51:08.471
And they will tell us.

51:08.531 --> 51:10.593
One of the things that we do, we kind of screen people.

51:10.633 --> 51:12.094
If you're looking for some

51:12.378 --> 51:16.963
information that's not in the Horns National Archives, we'll tell you that, and we're not going to give you a card.

51:17.704 --> 51:25.153
If the information is here, we ask you to sit at the computer, hit the space bar, and fill out the information so we can get you a research card.

51:25.173 --> 51:29.118
And then from there, we tell you where you have to go to get the expert information.

51:29.138 --> 51:32.642
And depending upon what records you're doing, that's what we send you.

51:32.662 --> 51:42.233
If you're doing military records, we tell you to go to the sexual research room, sign in that room, and go down to room 2400 and talk to one of the archivists of 2400.

51:42.652 --> 51:48.701
If you're dealing with records from a civilian agency, same procedure, but you go to them 26 times.

51:49.522 --> 52:00.859
If you're doing calligraphic records or architectural drawings, we tell the researchers you need to go into the third floor research room where those records are and talk to one of the architects.

52:00.879 --> 52:08.010
Motion pictures, sound recording, and videotapes, they would go to the fourth floor research room.

52:08.831 --> 52:11.275
And if it's still pictures, they would go to the sixth floor research room.

52:11.626 --> 52:17.272
But depending upon the media that you're researching, that will be the room that you would go into.

52:18.213 --> 52:23.518
And then we also explain to them that they can only take certain things in the research room.

52:23.558 --> 52:29.144
If you have notes, we will approve the notes to go in and stamp them.

52:29.164 --> 52:35.971
And we do that to distinguish what belongs to you as an individual as opposed to what belongs to the federal government.

52:35.991 --> 52:37.853
So we have to stamp everything that you take in.

52:38.103 --> 52:41.870
We ask people not to bring in briefcases or any type of enclosures.

52:41.890 --> 52:43.773
Pens.

52:43.793 --> 52:44.334
No pens.

52:44.374 --> 52:44.936
No pens.

52:44.956 --> 52:47.500
Number two pencils, probably.

52:47.701 --> 52:48.783
Sometimes we don't have number two.

52:49.263 --> 52:50.205
There's always a pencil.

52:50.927 --> 52:54.894
And the reason why we do that is that we found that some researchers have a tendency to actually write on a document.

52:55.515 --> 52:57.799
And once you write a document, you begin to destroy the document.

52:58.140 --> 52:59.402
So we don't want you to do that.

52:59.703 --> 53:00.784
So we have to use the console.

53:00.804 --> 53:02.807
We can always erase the lead on the console.

53:02.907 --> 53:06.672
See, when you use the word researcher here, that could really be anyone.

53:06.692 --> 53:10.197
We're not talking like a scholar at Harvard.

53:10.217 --> 53:12.500
No, you don't need to have a picture ID, right?

53:13.120 --> 53:13.501
Picture ID.

53:13.521 --> 53:17.646
So you haven't been schooled in scholarly disciplines.

53:17.666 --> 53:22.172
I mean, I would know never to bring a pen, for instance, into a reading room.

53:22.232 --> 53:27.499
At the same time, you'd be surprised how many scholars want to use pens.

53:27.749 --> 53:30.252
How many scholars want to take in briefcases?

53:31.153 --> 53:38.041
How many scholars want to take and go through the records the way they want to, not the way we ask them to?

53:38.722 --> 53:46.772
So even scholars are sometimes not prepared to come into research in the National Archives.

53:46.892 --> 53:49.895
How many researchers do you accommodate a year, approximately?

53:49.915 --> 53:52.458
Good question.

53:52.859 --> 53:53.740
I don't know any.

53:54.074 --> 54:00.304
We have probably our last annual report we have.

54:00.324 --> 54:01.986
That would be of interest to me.

54:02.006 --> 54:07.895
Okay, the vast majority of our researchers are... Seniorologists, yeah.

54:07.915 --> 54:10.199
Maybe 80%.

54:10.219 --> 54:12.442
But that's very important stuff for these people.

54:12.963 --> 54:16.068
Do you have one of those archives, too, brochures?

54:16.088 --> 54:16.929
Is that an extra one?

54:17.731 --> 54:17.991
Yeah.

54:19.213 --> 54:22.138
Is that the only one you have?

54:22.158 --> 54:22.478
No, we have one.

54:22.728 --> 54:31.321
I think I'll give you all that stuff, all those figures, stacking figures that you want.

54:33.084 --> 54:34.025
This is Rick Blondo.

54:34.206 --> 54:36.569
Rick normally gets scores.

54:36.629 --> 54:38.112
Don't give us much.

54:38.132 --> 54:43.059
But some of the technical information that you need, we're going to ask Rick.

54:43.079 --> 54:44.522
How many research did we get in a year?

54:45.143 --> 54:45.543
A year?

54:46.425 --> 54:49.309
I think I have some .

54:49.660 --> 54:51.442
Can I take it?

54:51.462 --> 54:51.923
Sure.

54:52.403 --> 54:54.125
No, here and downtown.

54:56.088 --> 54:59.872
So there's no reading, there's no research done downtown?

55:00.053 --> 55:00.894
Yes, there is.

55:01.074 --> 55:01.514
Oh, there is?

55:01.635 --> 55:02.195
Oh, sure.

55:02.375 --> 55:04.798
That building is still a very vital building.

55:04.999 --> 55:06.480
What's been on there?

55:06.500 --> 55:19.296
The records are kind of split, and the primarily records that we have downtown are legislative records, records dealing with government agencies prior to World War I, prior to 1900.

55:19.934 --> 55:26.543
records that have been categorized as genealogical records, genie records.

55:27.143 --> 55:39.059
And that becomes kind of a question mark because any record that we have can be associated with genealogy if we know how to use the records.

55:39.079 --> 55:45.047
So when we talk about classic genie records, we're talking about the census report, pension files,

55:45.803 --> 55:53.252
Revolutionary War, the Civil War, War of 1812, the N.A., and I think World War I, a Pinchiff House downtown.

55:53.933 --> 55:59.820
The immigration, past the arrival of, they're downtown.

56:01.822 --> 56:07.148
The immigration records are downtown.

56:07.168 --> 56:11.333
What about land records, are they downtown?

56:11.413 --> 56:12.154
I think so.

56:12.174 --> 56:13.836
And aren't our judicial records downtown?

56:14.137 --> 56:15.519
They're downtown.

56:15.539 --> 56:21.806
And the census for Indian population census was downtown.

56:22.667 --> 56:23.948
Those records would keep downtown.

56:24.829 --> 56:33.319
Now, what's out here are records that primarily began with 1900.

56:35.662 --> 56:36.663
Correct me if I'm wrong here.

56:36.683 --> 56:36.883
What?

56:37.684 --> 56:43.671
Records primarily began with 1900 out here.

56:44.562 --> 56:46.187
Okay, that's right.

56:46.207 --> 56:51.424
I should correct me if I'm wrong.

56:51.444 --> 56:58.065
Eric is another archivist out here that gives tours.

56:58.315 --> 57:01.619
Certain general categories of records take that count.

57:01.679 --> 57:03.121
That includes genealogy records.

57:03.141 --> 57:06.566
Just give it a little bit of a second.

57:07.106 --> 57:08.368
You know what I'm saying?

57:08.388 --> 57:08.829
Okay.

57:09.109 --> 57:11.853
Well, your things count in that general .

57:11.873 --> 57:14.396
Most recently I have the 96th annual report.

57:14.416 --> 57:15.137
That's good.

57:15.157 --> 57:17.400
Most recently what we put out, right?

57:17.500 --> 57:18.321
Yeah, right.

57:18.361 --> 57:20.243
The stats are here for the Washington, D.C.

57:20.263 --> 57:20.584
area.

57:20.604 --> 57:21.505
It's both our buildings.

57:22.160 --> 57:29.562
57,510 microfilm researchers and 56,807 non-microfilm.

57:30.104 --> 57:31.889
Those numbers go up every year.

57:33.133 --> 57:34.136
So you're welcome to TV.

57:34.196 --> 57:34.718
Thank you.

57:34.968 --> 57:46.685
Is that the only stat you needed?

57:46.705 --> 57:49.169
I doubt it.

57:49.830 --> 57:53.015
That's a lot of information.

57:53.696 --> 57:57.381
Sounds good.

57:57.597 --> 58:03.707
So if I were to come here, if I wanted to see my military records, for instance, from the low 60s, this is where I'd come?

58:03.867 --> 58:04.027
No.

58:04.348 --> 58:07.172
Unit records are here, but your service records are in St.

58:07.213 --> 58:07.874
Louis, Missouri.

58:08.094 --> 58:09.196
No, they were Navy records.

58:09.977 --> 58:11.039
Navy records are in St.

58:11.059 --> 58:11.660
Louis, Missouri.

58:11.860 --> 58:13.122
All military records.

58:13.142 --> 58:13.883
All service records.

58:13.903 --> 58:14.604
Service records.

58:15.346 --> 58:17.469
Fitness reports are all there, too?

58:17.489 --> 58:17.589
St.

58:17.609 --> 58:18.551
Louis.

58:18.571 --> 58:22.076
Anything that relates to one's personal records, I mean, we'll kind of know it.

58:22.177 --> 58:24.100
But is that a National Archives facility?

58:24.180 --> 58:24.280
Yeah.

58:25.137 --> 58:36.593
And what a lot of people are doing to search in Vietnam, they're coming here to get the reports, the data reports, and they will show the activity so they can show where they were wounded and get their claims done.

58:36.613 --> 58:38.976
Some of the other people are doing genealogy like that.

58:38.996 --> 58:41.760
That's why their gene records become questionable.

58:41.780 --> 58:52.135
Because if someone's father was killed over Vietnam, they come here to search the history of the unit to see if they can find out what happened to their parents.

58:52.815 --> 58:54.638
That's happening now, too.

58:55.225 --> 59:11.228
I think they're becoming broader now than they were before because you even get people who are doing cardiology to come out here to look at the pictures to get an image of how somebody lived in the late 1800s, 1800s.

59:11.248 --> 59:14.113
So they're doing that.

59:14.313 --> 59:20.642
It's all four of my grandparents who came to Ellis Island, that'd be downtown.

59:22.597 --> 59:30.188
All of the maps, all of the photographs, all of the motion pictures now, because they needed special housing in this building.

59:30.268 --> 59:34.754
It's much easier to design, to save the air preservation.

59:34.775 --> 59:36.257
Here's a question for you.

59:37.619 --> 59:44.228
The German National Library, for instance, they hope is sufficient well into the 21st century.

59:44.589 --> 59:46.692
This building has been open for four years.

59:47.232 --> 59:48.294
What do you project?

59:49.756 --> 59:51.118
How long will this facility

59:51.385 --> 59:57.660
to accommodate the records of the United States.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.825
And was that figured into the plans, I wonder?

59:59.845 --> 01:00:00.166
It was.

01:00:00.186 --> 01:00:02.391
It was, but we had lots of crime times.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:04.272
You know, the changes we put in.

01:00:04.772 --> 01:00:07.175
When government gets larger, we grow.

01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:08.996
When government gets smaller, we grow.

01:00:09.016 --> 01:00:11.259
Offers to check out and finish the records.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:14.742
A lot of things, a lot of very large set records come in.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:18.827
We didn't know where it would come.

01:00:18.867 --> 01:00:20.949
The finish of the vision of what's here in downtown.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.591
Okay.

01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:31.500
Genealogical records also include land records, records related to Indian, and military records before World War II.

01:00:32.493 --> 01:00:47.914
Records of Congress, records of courts, accepting those courts which are records which are in the regional facilities, World War I agency records, Depression-era records.

01:00:48.195 --> 01:00:53.542
In general, any agency which is not going to grow, which is defunct, not an outlaw or something else.

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:58.128
Records relating to D.C., District of Columbia.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:02.314
I think that covers all of it and that everything else is out here.

01:01:02.817 --> 01:01:05.841
So you're going to get records out here from all time periods.

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:13.453
If the State Department starts in 1789, it's the first cabinet agency, so we have State Department records going that far back.

01:01:13.813 --> 01:01:16.036
It depends on what the agency was doing and when it was created.

01:01:18.099 --> 01:01:23.848
We also have the Kennedy assassination records here, and we have, of course, what I was showing you, the Nixon Project.

01:01:23.868 --> 01:01:24.749
You mean the Warren Commission records?

01:01:24.769 --> 01:01:30.698
Well, yes, but we also, since then, there was a law that was passed in the Congress a few years back.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:38.990
saying that any agency that still had any records relating to the Kennedy assassination, which is a very broad category of records, needed to turn them over to the National Archives.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:44.057
So hundreds of thousands of pages have come to us in the last five years.

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:51.306
And the Nixon papers include 44 million pages.

01:01:51.346 --> 01:01:53.229
These are here.

01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.909
What's 44?

01:01:54.871 --> 01:01:59.757
And those would, you know, if we had a Nixon library that was a federal facility,

01:01:59.939 --> 01:02:02.283
at the library, but at the moment.

01:02:02.383 --> 01:02:08.532
How about the other presidents who were assassinating?

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:19.148
No, because Congress wanted to kind of... It was really based on the controversy, actually, to be frank.

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.971
It was based on Oliver Stone's film.

01:02:20.991 --> 01:02:27.280
That created a big hullabaloo in the Congress, and they wanted to kind of reopen the...

01:02:27.563 --> 01:02:35.160
not reopen the investigation, but to make sure that all of the records were actually declassified and in one place.
