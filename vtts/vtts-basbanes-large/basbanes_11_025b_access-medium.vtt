00:03.490 --> 00:16.115
The top several diagrams really deal with exactly the kinds of things you'd expect to find in a literary man's copy of this difficult but very rewarding text.

00:16.135 --> 00:22.146
Boudet records, for example, the form of a thunderbolt, which, as he says, you can see in ancient points.

00:22.347 --> 00:24.030
He's interested in iconography.

00:24.517 --> 00:44.678
He plots out rather rudely the form on the left of the Greek and on the right of the Roman theater mentioned by Vitruvius, trying to understand what the scene and the proscenium in the orchestra are, a subject on which, of course, scholars have beaten their heads against the archaeological evidence for centuries since his own time.

00:44.698 --> 00:49.343
In other cases, his interest is more technical than historical.

00:49.576 --> 00:56.242
On the bottom of the page, you see on the right, Goudet's note on the water wheel, which the Goudet describes.

00:56.262 --> 00:59.805
The notes in the illustration are technical, not classical.

01:00.105 --> 01:13.057
What's represented here, as the Latin text makes clear, the Latin text is a little hard to read, but what the Latin text makes clear is that this was not an ancient water wheel.

01:13.077 --> 01:17.461
This was the water wheel that was built for the bridge of Notre Dame and Paris.

01:17.902 --> 01:19.583
It's a piece of modern technology.

01:20.491 --> 01:36.970
And in copying out this and other, other to call it, he describes the sockets used in the villas of Milne to carry rainwater away from walls.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.175
He describes pumps and

01:39.661 --> 01:43.105
pulleys used to build the new Paris in his own day.

01:43.586 --> 02:04.470
He describes, from a passage which somehow fascinates me, the level Giocondo had invented, a long ruler with a bubble with a glass bubble in which a small bubble floated to show you whether the level was actually flat or not, just the sort of thing you might want to see Bob Doa using on this old hour, even apparently appearing here for the first time.

02:04.923 --> 02:14.093
Now, in copying all of this material out there, Ruben makes two points clear to us, and they're both points that I think tend to be forgotten sometimes nowadays.

02:14.613 --> 02:20.319
The first is that the sort of reading that Ruben and other scholars did was always a solitary activity.

02:20.860 --> 02:29.188
When we think of the Renaissance scholar in his study, who's almost always his, we probably tend to imagine something like Dura St.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.791
Jerome, a beautiful big room

02:32.193 --> 02:45.057
Quiet, perfectly proportioned, with little-ledded windows, and the single erudite, bold, and bearded man at work, with no company except the odd lion sitting quietly at his feet.

02:45.598 --> 02:48.203
Moudet, however, didn't always read this way.

02:48.424 --> 02:50.227
He read in company when he needed to.

02:50.407 --> 02:51.950
Had a technical expert yet.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.555
Made his study into a site of collaboration.

02:54.856 --> 03:13.780
And recent work by book historians like Bill Sherman and Alan Stewart in London has shown that this was by no means unusual, especially among royalty and aristocrats who often had a professional reader in their household who would interpret classical texts to them.

03:13.800 --> 03:19.868
Essex, for example, blamed his reader, Henry Cuff, for misleading him to the revolt at the cost of his head.

03:20.303 --> 03:22.726
an act which was seen as very unchivalrous.

03:22.746 --> 03:23.968
You shouldn't blame your reader.

03:25.030 --> 03:33.742
The second point that Vitruvius indicates is, I think, even more remarkable and even less likely to be noted in post-traditional times of scholarship.

03:33.762 --> 03:43.356
We tend to think that in the Renaissance just now, verbal and visual culture were pretty separate, and classical studies and modern technology even wider apart.

03:43.896 --> 03:49.905
Today, Vitruvius, and there are many, many parallels to it, which I won't cite here, but could cite eventually,

03:50.240 --> 03:56.870
would suggest that these separations are modern ones which we import backwards.

03:56.890 --> 04:01.637
And someone like Boudet read many of his texts for entirely practical ends.

04:01.677 --> 04:02.558
Boudet was a builder.

04:02.578 --> 04:05.382
He built himself a city house and a country house.

04:05.402 --> 04:10.510
As a secretary of the king, he had major technological and architectural responsibilities.

04:10.675 --> 04:18.323
And the way he prepared himself to carry these out is reading the best classical text in the light of the best modern experience.

04:18.343 --> 04:31.317
This intense tight unity between the ancients and the modern in such technical areas in making these quarterbacks is something that's easy to forget in an age where it seems highly implausible.

04:31.397 --> 04:39.265
Well, if the trubius mattered to the villa and garden builder and clay mattered to the bureaucrat, Homer mattered more than either to the classical scholar.

04:39.616 --> 04:58.975
the greatest of Asian poets, whose work was so beautifully and completely preserved, which we made to simply buy in a rather good printed edition from 1488, printed in the Greek type we all wish they'd won on using, instead of the Greek type that Aldo and others made popular, just a magnificent book.

04:59.782 --> 05:08.663
Boudet's notes on this are among the richest to be found in any of his books, and they're extraordinarily informative.

05:08.683 --> 05:13.555
They enable us to see how he learned through Greek language in the first place,

05:14.024 --> 05:22.558
measured the depth of his Greek scholarship, his version of Bonomos, and his human man behind the scholar.

05:22.578 --> 05:25.283
How did you learn Greek when you were young, Lude?

05:25.303 --> 05:26.785
Well, it wasn't easy.

05:26.805 --> 05:33.116
There was one Greek in Paris, George Hermonimus, scribe and book dealer, who gave lessons.

05:33.877 --> 05:40.268
Lude said long after in a letter, well, I started by getting hold of a certain Greek, but, you know, really, he got hold of me.

05:40.822 --> 05:50.865
Anonymous taught Boudet to write the script, to pronounce it, stole him a lot of books, but couldn't actually interpret classical or biblical read in any modern language.

05:51.233 --> 05:55.838
So he both sat down and taught himself Greek from the start.

05:55.858 --> 05:59.082
And the book in Princeton actually lets us see how he did it.

05:59.182 --> 06:08.051
You go back to the first page, you see on the right a whole series of not, I admit, highly legible marginal losses.

06:08.832 --> 06:16.060
What these are are definitions, statements, for every difficult or unusual word in the Homeric chapter?

06:16.428 --> 06:26.584
which he took from a very simple Byzantine school-like commentary on Homer and entered word by word by word in the first means of his text.

06:27.385 --> 06:44.511
If you can imagine learning to read the German at the classical age of German literature by starting at scratch, taking a copy of Gertz's Faust part two in the school-boy dictionary, and teaching yourself the language by looking up each word as it occurs,

06:44.795 --> 06:53.301
You take something as the measure Ude has achieved, and the mere fact that he actually learned to read this poem is absolutely extraordinary.

06:53.863 --> 06:55.969
But he did much more than read it.

06:56.135 --> 07:09.751
He read it with, for example, the greatest of all medieval Homeric commentaries, that of the 12th century scholar Eustavius of Thessalonica, which itself builds four fat volumes of his modern edition for the Iliad alone.

07:10.272 --> 07:16.960
And he copied rich segments of that into the margins of his text, as he does on the right, even at this first page.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.764
And he read other, rarer texts as well.

07:20.824 --> 07:25.770
If you look at the left-hand image on page five of your handout,

07:26.628 --> 07:36.559
At the first extensive note, this is actually a note of electrifying interest for anyone interested in the sense of manuscripts.

07:36.579 --> 07:46.109
It's a famous passage in the beginning of Book Three of the Iliad, where Paris, whom we don't think of as a great warrior, seems to say, come on and fight to all the Greeks.

07:46.249 --> 07:47.090
I'll take you all on.

07:47.370 --> 07:48.171
Take you on one by one.

07:48.251 --> 07:49.593
I'll take you on altogether.

07:50.013 --> 07:51.154
It seems implausible.

07:51.175 --> 07:53.577
We think of Paris as a lover, more than a fighter.

07:54.418 --> 07:56.280
And we're not the first to think that way.

07:56.598 --> 08:04.330
In the Alexandria Library, professional scholars like Aristarchus and Zomotitus, who edited the Homeric texts,

08:04.883 --> 08:09.752
also found that the boasts of Paris attended against their sense of decor.

08:10.272 --> 08:21.652
They entered by the line, in their official copies of the text, a horizontal line, and in their commentaries, they wrote notes in which they said, this line is appetized.

08:21.672 --> 08:30.047
It is excised from the text when we read it and think about it, though not when we write it, because it violates literary viola.

08:30.668 --> 08:44.767
This was what ancient scholarship was about in the Alexandrian Museum, walking at an employment, showing all the things that he'd done wrong from the standpoint of the more sophisticated, colonistic place of the Alexandrian Museum.

08:46.830 --> 08:50.415
So far as classical scholarship goes, to this very moment,

08:50.615 --> 09:03.915
No scholar knew anything about this until 1788, when the one manuscript, now in Venice, that records the Alexandrian's doings to the text of all that was published.

09:04.621 --> 09:14.682
Boudin, in this note, and in many others scattered through his books, records these Alexandrian debates about the cutting of lines from the text of Homer.

09:14.702 --> 09:25.684
He heard the ancestral voices of the first professional scholars in the West chanting about textual criticism more than two centuries before he's supposed to have done so.

09:28.077 --> 09:35.228
How he made this plug into the party line of the classical tradition and part of the status, I have not yet been able to discover.

09:35.728 --> 09:38.132
He never worked in the biblioteca much.

09:38.192 --> 09:41.737
When he was in Venice, the books were still in crates anyhow.

09:41.757 --> 09:46.204
He tried to get friends to spy out what was there and basically failed to do so.

09:46.977 --> 09:55.981
When I gave a much more detailed lecture on this copy of Homer in Italy, an Italian period of time came up to me afterwards and said, that was very nice.

09:56.101 --> 10:00.413
It's a shame you failed to find the Italian source that he must have been copying.

10:00.545 --> 10:09.934
And she then gave me the signatures of two copies of the first edition of Homer, one in the Vatican, and one in Paris, which she assured me would contain the material we didn't use.

10:10.474 --> 10:11.876
I'm happy to report that they didn't.

10:14.118 --> 10:17.060
Where this and other notes come from, we do not know.

10:17.260 --> 10:28.611
But what we do know is that this book also is a kind of dramatic crossroads in the movement of classical texts and material, a work of deep fascination to the technical scholar.

10:28.996 --> 10:33.154
But it's not only fascinating from a standpoint of Greek philology.

10:34.018 --> 10:38.517
Today's Homeric commentary, like this play,

10:38.800 --> 10:41.543
show the man as well as the scholar.

10:41.563 --> 10:45.068
And for helpiest reason, Jey was deeply committed to the classics.

10:45.628 --> 10:56.261
The more humor he read, the more uneasy he felt about the way that Homer's heroes and God had with each other, promiscuous goddesses, irritable heroes who attacked their tongues.

10:56.722 --> 11:00.066
How could you find good moral and pragmatic lessons here?

11:00.299 --> 11:01.180
who they worried.

11:01.781 --> 11:18.005
He ransacked his sources, and in an introductory text which came with Homer in the edition that he had, a work that he did in those days to Plutarch, he found his answer, which is right here, beside the case in the margin of the second text on the fifth page.

11:18.025 --> 11:22.932
Plutarch says that the ancient poets had enhanced the higher truths they had to teach.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.755
behind texts which would conceal him from profane eyes.

11:27.296 --> 11:36.712
Only an allegorical interpretation which saw the poor beneath the husk would make it possible really to see what the Iliad and Odyssey were about.

11:36.732 --> 11:47.130
He goes on to suggest a number of allegories which Boudet indeed went on to work out in detail in the margins of his copy and often to reuse in his own published works.

11:47.110 --> 11:52.836
Now, this meant a great deal of Jude.

11:52.856 --> 11:54.397
The way we know that, it's important to note that Jude's face.

11:55.178 --> 12:01.204
I've looked at 50 books from Jude's library, and only one of them have I ever found the face used as a note.

12:01.744 --> 12:06.068
It occurs in one of his copies of the Gospels in Cambridge University Library.

12:06.709 --> 12:16.138
This rich lawyer put a face by Jesus' statement that it will be as easy for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle, for a rich man to enter the kingdom in heaven,

12:16.608 --> 12:27.581
Once again, if you can crack the code and read the language, you can see under the Greek technicalities that's formed the margins of this book, a person struggling.

12:28.822 --> 12:37.512
Now, critics of the study of marginal notes, and we have our critics like everyone else, often insist that marginal notes don't really record a reading.

12:38.213 --> 12:40.776
They record that they are the more formal

12:41.144 --> 12:45.851
whose superior record is an experience of contact with the text.

12:45.871 --> 12:51.620
The more formal, the more elaborate, the more carefully written the notes, the sharper such criticism has to be.

12:52.401 --> 12:54.745
I find this argument deeply problematic.

12:54.765 --> 13:06.122
In principle, it seems that they have ideas that throw away the fullest evidence we have on the ground that it's not perfect, that it's not the evidence you might want, that we don't have Hickson's White House capes written as readers.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.538
But I think it's worse than a council of despair.

13:09.558 --> 13:11.988
It's also a piece of bad historical reasoning.

13:12.270 --> 13:16.990
An anachronistic projection currently goes back into another world.

13:17.105 --> 13:18.887
What is reading now?

13:18.907 --> 13:25.134
When Sven Burkert set out to describe it in the Lindenburg Elegies, he assumed it was reading fiction now.

13:25.635 --> 13:40.632
The intense, emotionally involved, probably canon pencil-less writing of a serious novel, and assumed that that was reading, and that, as he argues, was threatened by the rise of other forms of movements and communication with texts.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.519
This seems to me to be flat wrong.

13:43.539 --> 13:51.819
What we need to do is not to say, this isn't reading, because reading is what we do, but to say, reading then must be different from reading now.

13:51.979 --> 13:56.089
That may seem a very simple proposition, but historians are simple beasts.

13:56.305 --> 14:04.532
As you know, in the Reformation, works of supererogation were defined as those works which we couldn't carry out, which weren't essential to salvation.

14:04.552 --> 14:08.936
Thinking is one of those for historians.

14:08.956 --> 14:22.989
Now, it seems to me suggests actually a model of reading in the early 16th century, a model in which reading has at least two clear purposes, which are both unfamiliar to us, in addition to other literary purposes, which are probably familiar to us.

14:23.009 --> 14:25.671
The first is documentary, even archival.

14:26.174 --> 14:53.008
The reader confronted a text, a difficult, rewarding, demented classical text, expressed with it, interpreted it, and made that text not only a memory theater so he could use it, but also a memorial, a record of his own confrontation with the past, a record which was part of the documentation of his life and the life of his literary circle, as important a part of the documentation perhaps as his informal writing.

14:52.988 --> 15:09.215
This kind of reading clearly begins with Petrarch, who, as the first Californian spirit that he was, confided to his magnificent copy of Virgil, the dates of his first encounter with Laura at her death of the plague some twenty years later.

15:09.755 --> 15:12.740
It continues throughout the Italian Renaissance.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.887
Angelo Lizziano, the philologist whose papers one day saw in Florence,

15:16.867 --> 15:27.445
carefully dated his copies of printed books, registered the manuscripts with which he collated them, mentioned the sometimes August company in which he carried out this work.

15:27.886 --> 15:39.465
The young Pietro Benvo, who as an old man gives the wonderful speech on love in the last book of Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, appears as a young man doing technical Latin philology with Luciano.

15:40.137 --> 15:50.228
Uday, too, used his books to document his own achievement as a scholar, made them into an archive in the material environment of his scholarship.

15:50.748 --> 16:06.685
As you see, for example, on the right hand of the left page, from the subscription to his film in which he records how Devani de Kondo had amended and restored his copy of Pliny from an ancient, a very ancient Parisian copy.

16:06.901 --> 16:17.903
This kind of self-documentation is not what we think of reading as doing, but there's no reason to assume that you didn't think of that in the 15th and 16th century as much reason to think you did.

16:18.825 --> 16:23.814
But Budet also wrote for another purpose, which I've already suggested more than once.

16:24.275 --> 16:28.183
He wrote in Emulation of Clinton, he read in Emulation of Clinton,

16:28.332 --> 16:29.453
He read to write.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.275
He read to collect material.

16:31.795 --> 16:38.782
But unlike Fleming, who read for substance, who collected material for his natural history, Lude read a bubble for style.

16:39.703 --> 16:45.889
And the way we know this, I can't illustrate for you visually for reasons that become clear and sane.

16:45.909 --> 16:55.538
It always bothered me that I had only Lude's books, only the books in which he raised the margins, because we all know that in the 15th, 15th, 17th centuries,

16:55.737 --> 16:59.143
He didn't read, sitting back in an armchair with one book.

16:59.464 --> 17:11.687
He read, and here I give you an illustration from Comanius' Morbus Pictus, sitting upright at a desk with a commonplace book, a solider book, into which he systematically entered excerpts from one of his readings.

17:12.376 --> 17:19.927
It was long known that seven such books had been in Geneva in a private library in the 19th century.

17:19.947 --> 17:31.144
In 1994, thanks to the intervention of some great source scholars, I was invited to the Fondational Art outside Geneva and walked in a bedroom for a week with those seven notebooks.

17:31.124 --> 17:40.224
which are still, by the way, in a private library in Geneva, in fact, in the library of one or two days descendants.

17:40.244 --> 17:48.643
Despite the tendency to hyper-mentalate continually and sleep deprivation, I was able to go through all 2,000 pages.

17:49.315 --> 17:58.187
These surviving notebooks are the fragments of an enormous reprocessing system, the tip of a lost iceberg.

17:58.207 --> 18:06.318
For one thing, they don't contain any notes on Petruvius or hardly any notes on Homer.

18:06.338 --> 18:09.923
Yet I'm sure that these books were also reprocessed like others.

18:10.257 --> 18:23.203
What they do contain is a fascinating, color-coded, elaborate system breaking every classical text down into blocks that Boudet himself could reuse in his own writing, flattened in Greek.

18:23.757 --> 18:28.264
Every time he notes a word or a phrase, he notes how you can use it again.

18:28.284 --> 18:40.665
So one of his rare, when he was talking about the adjective, having a hundred hands, he says, we can use this talking about a vocacious paper.

18:40.685 --> 18:48.297
So in addition to the books, there was, in Mude's practice study, an enormous systematic notebook system.

18:48.648 --> 18:55.940
in which he digested and filed and reprocessed everything that he read in order to perfect his style.

18:56.080 --> 19:02.109
Not that most of his readers would agree that a quick dip in the brackish borders of his Latin is really too refreshing.

19:02.770 --> 19:10.002
I would suspect, though the Sevens arrived in no post-unconfirmed, that there was a second set at large for content.

19:10.022 --> 19:16.292
So lost but barely visible behind the screen of imperfect transmission.

19:16.576 --> 19:42.415
is an extraordinary system in which reading and reading are tightly interlocked, in which one read to write, a way of reading less like what we now think of as reading, I think in the way reporters read, taking from Lexis material from agency copy and rewriting it more or less into something original before sending it out again, a kind of reading with which we may become familiar in the future.

19:43.424 --> 19:47.209
Boudet's books, in other words, offer challenges of many times.

19:47.229 --> 20:02.209
To normal ways of storing and studying Renaissance books, to standard assumptions about the experience of pre-modern readers, to the ill-considered efforts of my critics to remove the complex idiosyncratic evidence of marginal notes from the overview of historians of the book.

20:03.170 --> 20:09.358
They offer fascinating middle-range information about the intellectual history of Renaissance.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.900
They don't use plenty of information

20:12.567 --> 20:25.087
I think, explain in a very neat, microscopic way, like a fine illumination, with dilemmas that were launched in the Northern Renaissance until they exploded in their later time.

20:25.107 --> 20:31.056
Above all, though, they do what the best historical evidence you can find anywhere does.

20:31.076 --> 20:33.701
They draw the senses through the flesh and the body.

20:33.721 --> 20:35.183
One last example.

20:36.007 --> 20:40.051
Commissaires of Boudet tend to think of him as a pretty crossword, dignified gentleman.

20:40.451 --> 20:47.497
When a servant entered his study one day to inform him that his house was on fire, he replied, my compliments to Madame Boudet.

20:47.778 --> 20:51.841
Kindly tell her that domestic affairs are her concern.

20:51.861 --> 20:55.044
He shut the door and went on greeting.

20:55.144 --> 21:00.069
As neat an application of the doctrine of separate spheres as I've ever encountered.

21:00.089 --> 21:04.933
But Boudet had more tender moments too, and one of them occurs precisely in his copy of Homer.

21:04.913 --> 21:12.663
In one of the introductory texts to Homer, there's a fabulous anecdote about how the blind poet encounters some priestesses sacrificing.

21:13.123 --> 21:20.693
He asks what god they're sacrificing to, and the head priestess refuses to tell them, and says, man, go away from our rights.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.674
Homer curses her.

21:22.355 --> 21:27.201
In future, he says, may you no longer love scalp-strong young men.

21:27.922 --> 21:34.330
May you love only men with gray hair, weak knees, dribbling chin, old men.

21:34.630 --> 21:35.731
and goes on his way.

21:36.833 --> 21:43.221
Boudet, when he read these lines, was in later middle age and about to marry a 14-year-old girl.

21:43.241 --> 21:52.632
It's not surprising that, though it is quite wonderful, that he wrote, mark these verses.

21:52.652 --> 22:04.587
Boudet turned to his books and wrote them and did so in discreet grief, not just for the information they could offer him, because they were his best confidence,

22:04.938 --> 22:13.792
his fondest advisors, his closest friends, even if his conversations with them could take place only on paper and in the peace of security of an ancient language.

22:14.393 --> 22:22.326
For me, the history of reading performs no more rewarding service than enabling us to eavesdrop on close encounters of this language kind.

22:22.666 --> 22:23.267
Thank you.

22:37.675 --> 22:38.799
That was terrific.

22:39.502 --> 22:44.259
That was really good.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.487
Will these generally be published in the...
