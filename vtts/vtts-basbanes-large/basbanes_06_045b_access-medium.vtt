WEBVTT

00:03.760 --> 00:05.863
She wrote some wonderful books.

00:05.943 --> 00:09.687
Don't tell me she's important in how you live your life in America.

00:11.289 --> 00:12.351
She isn't.

00:12.371 --> 00:13.312
Louisa May Alcott.

00:13.672 --> 00:15.915
Louisa May Alcott.

00:15.935 --> 00:17.377
And I love her as much as anybody else.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.102
But to compare her to William Faulkner is insanity.

00:24.846 --> 00:27.470
I think they have good father at the New York Public Library.

00:29.652 --> 00:31.675
I know that people have offered them books

00:32.600 --> 00:36.805
But you probably were making demands that everything be kept together as they are at Michigan.

00:37.906 --> 00:38.347
Is that right?

00:38.367 --> 00:42.451
Put the records, shall we be agreed?

00:42.471 --> 00:43.573
Yes, he said, sure.

00:46.116 --> 00:47.958
Then that's when she said we don't have any room.

00:47.978 --> 00:48.539
That's the point.

00:48.659 --> 00:52.964
They would love to have your books, as long as they could integrate them into the general collection.

00:52.984 --> 00:56.928
These are second copies, and these are signed to me as opposed to second.

00:56.948 --> 01:00.953
I took all the books, and then I wound up

01:01.658 --> 01:03.581
One, two, three.

01:04.261 --> 01:04.762
More folks.

01:04.882 --> 01:06.745
I mean, second copy, third copy.

01:06.765 --> 01:07.085
Here.

01:08.267 --> 01:11.091
Here.

01:11.151 --> 01:15.276
Some came out without signature sheets, because the signature sheets are not part of the book.

01:15.316 --> 01:15.757
They're tipped in.

01:15.777 --> 01:16.698
They're tipped in, yeah.

01:17.279 --> 01:18.561
So, this is more rare.

01:21.224 --> 01:22.286
This is more rare.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.069
That's right, because it's an aberration.

01:27.372 --> 01:28.133
More rare.

01:29.695 --> 01:30.356
More scarce.

01:31.077 --> 01:31.598
More scarce.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.768
I think, because I think I'd still like to have cloth and signature.

01:37.788 --> 01:38.609
Great American book.

01:41.373 --> 01:42.975
Side down and backwards or something.

01:42.995 --> 01:44.677
Something's transposed in here.

01:44.697 --> 01:45.318
It's a mess.

01:46.219 --> 01:47.040
It's a mess.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.783
It's the Day of the Locust Bank.

01:48.803 --> 01:49.524
Daniel Liszt.

01:49.544 --> 01:52.227
It's the great Hollywood novel.

01:52.247 --> 01:52.347
Yeah.

01:52.367 --> 01:52.488
Right.

01:52.508 --> 01:53.329
Misfound copy.

01:53.349 --> 01:55.572
Pages are bound between eight and nine.

01:57.755 --> 01:59.497
Probably the only one like that.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.720
You're still saving a few American books.

02:02.982 --> 02:04.624
Have you seen this?

02:04.645 --> 02:05.546
Not that copy of it.

02:05.846 --> 02:08.991
They're putting these out for 30, 35 dollars.

02:09.472 --> 02:11.555
These are the pseudo-first editions.

02:11.575 --> 02:11.896
Yes.

02:12.797 --> 02:24.314
And what's insanely great is that I found this for 50 cents, and all the dealers left it on the charity auction at the Association of University Women.

02:24.395 --> 02:24.755
Think of this.

02:25.616 --> 02:27.319
Fifteen of the Ann Arbor dealers

02:27.569 --> 02:28.711
Left this sitting there.

02:29.091 --> 02:29.772
For 50 cents.

02:30.012 --> 02:30.913
For 50 cents.

02:30.994 --> 02:32.375
You can't buy the paperback.

02:32.576 --> 02:35.099
This alone is being advertised for $50.

02:35.279 --> 02:37.743
Well, that's got the Robert Stone insurance.

02:37.763 --> 02:37.863
Yeah.

02:37.883 --> 02:38.624
Oh, my God.

02:40.847 --> 02:41.688
They left it there.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.473
So they're not too smart.

02:45.493 --> 02:45.934
That's nice.

02:45.954 --> 02:48.417
No, I don't have it.

02:48.457 --> 02:49.078
Pretty interesting.

02:49.418 --> 02:52.402
But the original one is another line.

02:52.823 --> 02:53.684
There's a line here.

02:54.365 --> 02:54.505
Mm-hmm.

02:54.687 --> 02:58.112
And they didn't pick it up in the facsimile, and I don't know what that means.

02:58.893 --> 03:00.715
Well, it's not an exact facsimile.

03:02.057 --> 03:02.157
Yeah.

03:02.177 --> 03:03.258
I showed it to Peter Howard.

03:03.278 --> 03:04.119
It was very interesting.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.462
He doesn't care for these things anyway, but he's wrong.

03:06.483 --> 03:06.903
He's wrong.

03:07.083 --> 03:07.644
You think so?

03:07.664 --> 03:08.966
Yeah, because it's another printing.

03:09.146 --> 03:11.209
It's another... It's another state, I guess.

03:11.249 --> 03:12.190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:12.210 --> 03:12.851
And they're wonderful.

03:12.871 --> 03:14.854
They're fresh, and it's sort of good.

03:15.735 --> 03:17.978
That's Bosner, and that's the only one I have.

03:17.998 --> 03:18.338
All right.

03:18.358 --> 03:19.800
If you look at it, Bill Kinsella.

03:20.337 --> 03:23.600
and you're looking at a guy who turns out his own newsletters.

03:27.724 --> 03:29.145
That's in the back.

03:30.967 --> 03:39.835
A living author who's so wrapped up with his collectors that he sends the collectors like a private newsletter.

03:40.536 --> 03:42.598
K-A-N-S-E-L-L-A, Bill Kinsella.

03:42.718 --> 03:49.264
The best living Canadian writer, writer of which became Field of Dreams.

03:51.387 --> 03:58.216
Steve Daniels, W. Picassella, self-serving, one-size-fits-all, year-end letter, and environmental impact statement.

03:58.236 --> 03:58.757
That's funny.

03:59.598 --> 04:00.379
Reflectable now.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.482
Self-serving.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.346
Let me write down his address, David.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.230
And brought him in and showed him what I do.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.591
It triggered something.

04:09.611 --> 04:11.854
Right in here?

04:11.894 --> 04:13.256
Not here, but it was at the time.

04:13.977 --> 04:14.959
His wife was with him.

04:15.099 --> 04:16.821
His wife does this.

04:19.552 --> 04:20.954
I mean, do you bring authors in?

04:20.974 --> 04:21.294
Yes.

04:22.315 --> 04:27.180
He was on a book and author luncheon, and afterwards we took him to dinner and brought him to our house.

04:29.423 --> 04:30.184
Partially annotated.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.806
You can't even find the first print.

04:31.826 --> 04:34.589
I still got three of them.

04:34.609 --> 04:38.593
Run by his wife to further the career.

04:41.276 --> 04:43.899
Remember I told you about authors and love-hate relationships?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.741
There are people like Bill Kinsella.

04:45.821 --> 04:46.282
Love, love.

04:46.342 --> 04:48.044
The other way around, yeah.

04:48.064 --> 04:49.305
Very fascinating.

04:50.956 --> 04:54.982
Trying to secure his place, participating in the process.

04:55.703 --> 04:57.966
You're talking about a $450 book now.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.228
There's only 100 of these.

04:59.248 --> 05:06.940
This first book was hardcover and soft and only, only, only, only, only.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.066
And this was small press stuff.

05:11.486 --> 05:12.868
And you can't find any of these.

05:12.888 --> 05:13.469
I bought them all.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.752
I bought them all, all, all, all.

05:15.873 --> 05:18.837
Everything I buy, everything, including

05:21.010 --> 05:22.732
So, everything.

05:22.832 --> 05:23.893
I collect him, everything.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.034
You still collect him?

05:26.915 --> 05:31.540
When you say you've divested yourself of contemporary writers, that's not exactly true then.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.902
I divested myself of the American writers.

05:33.962 --> 05:38.186
Here's Gunner Grass in translation and the post-war Germans.

05:39.207 --> 05:41.629
Of course I didn't divest myself of him.

05:41.649 --> 05:45.733
I'm telling you, I have some small collections there.

05:45.753 --> 05:48.636
I brought back from him because he heard about it and didn't know what to do.

05:49.056 --> 05:50.157
I brought back him

05:50.677 --> 06:01.248
I met his translator and his critic in Moscow, and I brought him copies of his contributions in the Russian books that he didn't even know about.

06:01.289 --> 06:18.287
His agent didn't even know about it.

06:18.436 --> 06:22.180
Kinsella, who sent you a stained napkin with something that he wrote on it.

06:23.261 --> 06:23.961
Unsolicited.

06:26.103 --> 06:28.806
Don't you think this is a fellow who's taking himself a bit too seriously?

06:31.809 --> 06:35.172
I accept him as he is.

06:35.212 --> 06:39.016
His stories are only American Indian and baseball.

06:39.597 --> 06:42.600
Seemingly the topics are slight, but he's really wonderful.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.422
I'm trying to find his first story, but what's the difference?

06:45.502 --> 06:46.063
That's okay.

06:47.647 --> 06:52.891
I'd love to have a figure.

06:53.372 --> 06:57.175
Here's Henry Roth, 90 years old, forgotten.

07:04.181 --> 07:05.262
The trailer.

07:05.882 --> 07:06.263
She knew.

07:06.623 --> 07:09.886
Where did she know now?

07:10.206 --> 07:10.686
Our house.

07:10.726 --> 07:11.927
Our house.

07:12.087 --> 07:12.708
She's house.

07:15.911 --> 07:17.552
And those who do the inspector.

07:18.950 --> 07:21.452
It started in 1934.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.254
Such that again.

07:23.594 --> 07:27.959
What about the trailer in Albuquerque?

07:27.979 --> 07:29.560
It was in the trailer in Albuquerque.

07:31.282 --> 07:37.168
Probably the greatest single 20th century Jewish book.

07:37.388 --> 07:41.252
A little after that, but basically exhausted.

07:45.636 --> 07:47.978
Years later, it was designated one of the

07:49.055 --> 07:53.160
on, what do they call it, unknown?

07:53.480 --> 07:55.803
Yeah, and then had a second life in 1960.

07:56.204 --> 08:05.975
Well, it was front page in the New York Times.

08:05.995 --> 08:08.138
What is the function of a National Library?

08:09.399 --> 08:18.150
To me, the failure is including our library funders, is the inability to show the people

08:19.261 --> 08:29.916
Okay, let's go back.

08:30.537 --> 08:33.040
Let's go back to the roots of your collecting.

08:35.604 --> 08:39.970
We've covered quite thoroughly, I think, and the Faulkner.

08:41.452 --> 08:46.319
But we're the only collector that subscribes to both P.W.

08:46.339 --> 08:48.762
and A.B.

08:48.782 --> 08:49.183
about that.

08:49.568 --> 08:54.232
Why are you interested in books that are not published yet?

08:55.513 --> 09:01.999
Well, I've got to start with the idea that once I saw P.W.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.324
in my high school library, it opened up a whole world for me.

09:08.765 --> 09:17.753
Because I was thinking of collecting some comics and books to so-called adult material.

09:21.580 --> 09:24.403
It showed me more than what the publishing industry was.

09:25.304 --> 09:32.773
It showed me that in the forecast page, I could actually know ahead of time what books were going to appear in the bookstores.

09:35.136 --> 09:37.038
Talking about writers that I was interested in.

09:37.058 --> 09:43.446
With Hawthorne, it still would be okay because there'd be some books on Hawthorne appearing in P.W.

09:44.107 --> 09:45.068
expedient than that.

09:45.508 --> 09:46.950
We were talking about living writers.

09:47.911 --> 09:49.613
And there was a lot of them on the pages there.

09:50.116 --> 09:52.179
Every issue has.

09:52.199 --> 09:53.421
You said today in the car.

09:53.701 --> 09:54.783
You are interested in collecting.

09:54.863 --> 09:55.985
I wanted to collect me.

09:56.165 --> 09:57.046
What did you mean by that?

09:57.587 --> 10:01.613
I came from Russia in 1900 when we were six years old.

10:02.915 --> 10:03.275
America.

10:03.876 --> 10:08.443
And in 1948 when the State of Israel was created, this is the triangle.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.867
I came from Russia.

10:11.668 --> 10:12.649
I'm in America now.

10:12.729 --> 10:15.073
It's possible that we may go to live in Israel someday.

10:15.894 --> 10:16.495
At least we'll have.

10:18.736 --> 10:29.370
I consider the people that are operating in Moscow today in publishing and in writing and in book selling, that I'm able to go there and communicate.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.252
And the business that's here, who's in the room, it's me.

10:32.354 --> 10:35.798
I never was interested in not being me.

10:35.818 --> 10:37.861
Yeah, but I mean in terms of collecting authors.

10:37.901 --> 10:39.904
You said the style of clock that he was alive.

10:40.705 --> 10:41.185
That's me.

10:43.008 --> 10:43.428
Two things.

10:45.951 --> 10:47.173
Me chronologically.

10:47.828 --> 10:54.077
It's me chronologically, but it's also me even closer than that if I can be with these people.

10:55.118 --> 10:56.941
And I am with these people.

10:56.961 --> 11:00.967
I'm not with Faulkner, but I was with his niece and his sister.

11:00.987 --> 11:02.969
For years now, I know the sister-in-law and the niece.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.091
And you went to his funeral.

11:04.532 --> 11:06.915
I went to his funeral.

11:06.935 --> 11:14.926
So it's me chronologically in America, but it's also me visiting Oxford, Mississippi and knowing the families.

11:14.947 --> 11:16.409
That's me.

11:16.429 --> 11:17.430
I'm in the picture.

11:18.710 --> 11:19.791
You say, who's that?

11:19.971 --> 11:22.794
That's Toby Holton.

11:22.814 --> 11:24.316
Tell me about seeking writers out.

11:24.356 --> 11:27.058
Tell me some of the situations, some of the experiences you have.

11:27.078 --> 11:30.602
A photograph in the house of Tennessee Williams and yourself and your father.

11:32.884 --> 11:33.645
I think they came in.

11:33.665 --> 11:34.606
I forgot where it was.

11:35.026 --> 11:36.988
I think it was Wayne State University.

11:38.630 --> 11:43.194
And I was probably the only white person to bring a couple books for him to sign.

11:43.214 --> 11:45.797
I remember that.

11:47.701 --> 11:55.552
Chrissy Williams appeared in an antiquarian bookstore, and I sponsored an evening reception for him.

11:55.572 --> 11:58.516
He was in Detroit.

12:03.403 --> 12:05.867
Where did you make contact with him?

12:05.887 --> 12:11.715
Somebody else made contact and arranged for him, and I picked him up.

12:12.255 --> 12:12.696
Hello, Rome.

12:14.619 --> 12:15.480
A little hungover.

12:16.456 --> 12:27.527
probably on dope, and for some reason finishing dessert, even though I told him he shouldn't eat, put this stain all over his time.

12:27.547 --> 12:39.980
So at that point it really struck me, you know, that I shouldn't want to know these people to the degree that... Maybe the writer is best known through the work.

12:41.341 --> 12:45.906
I didn't realize he was an alcoholic, so bad, and a lonely person.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.685
But I saw him that way.

12:47.705 --> 12:48.666
So of course I learned.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.128
Of course I learned.

12:50.148 --> 12:54.854
I didn't know he was an alcoholic dope addict that couldn't function.

12:55.014 --> 12:56.456
Among other vices.

12:58.179 --> 12:59.600
That's how I learned, of course.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.947
The writers, are they writing?

13:05.829 --> 13:16.062
There's a problem for me because almost from the very beginning of my collecting, I was doing a lot of reading of critical matters.

13:17.425 --> 13:33.301
I still am a person who will not go to a movie without reading maybe 80, never, never go to a movie without knowing almost everything through critics.

13:33.622 --> 13:35.484
I respect critics.

13:35.504 --> 13:40.809
I don't respect any one or two, but I take the whole body and then make my own decisions.

13:40.829 --> 13:43.111
I never want to be surprised.

13:43.131 --> 13:44.413
I never want to be entertained.

13:46.275 --> 13:46.555
No.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.817
I mean, this goes back to what we were talking about yesterday.

13:50.238 --> 13:56.446
You don't go to see a Broadway production of Hamlet hoping, I mean amused, I mean entertained.

13:56.466 --> 13:57.167
Going in, I don't.

13:57.928 --> 14:01.253
If it happens, it happens.

14:01.293 --> 14:02.875
I don't anticipate it.

14:02.935 --> 14:03.996
Isn't there a spiritual limit?

14:04.016 --> 14:04.838
I don't anticipate it.

14:04.878 --> 14:05.498
I don't fear it.

14:05.539 --> 14:06.259
I don't think about it.

14:06.380 --> 14:07.661
You fear it done beautifully?

14:07.701 --> 14:08.823
That doesn't entertain you?

14:09.043 --> 14:10.285
I don't go to classical.

14:10.926 --> 14:11.967
I go to my own time.

14:12.147 --> 14:13.369
I stood up.

14:14.092 --> 14:27.210
and saw, within one week, I saw Marlon Brando, the first week, Greek I Named Desire, and saw Lee J. Cobb's first week of talking about somebody who's a Syrian.

14:28.852 --> 14:29.733
I don't care about them.

14:33.638 --> 14:34.660
I care about them.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.863
It just lays me out.

14:36.883 --> 14:38.205
It's too late.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.449
But I have some wonderful material which is gone now.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.023
I was collecting Sam Shepard.

14:44.043 --> 14:49.129
Nobody even knew who Sam Shepard was, and I was collecting it.

14:49.149 --> 15:02.084
In 1979, I sold my American literature collection, with the exception of Daniel West and William Faulkner, to some of those books he still had.

15:04.246 --> 15:05.548
Tell me a little bit about the decision.

15:05.568 --> 15:06.890
Had you become bored with it?

15:08.391 --> 15:09.833
Had you become bored with these writers?

15:10.522 --> 15:15.028
two things happened almost at the same moment.

15:15.629 --> 15:22.318
As usual, decisions are based on one fact alone.

15:22.939 --> 15:24.561
Fact of elimination.

15:26.664 --> 15:30.489
Fact one, I began to have interest in works and translations.

15:32.792 --> 15:38.520
I had been working for six years on Israeli literature, working with and acquiring books of Soviet literature.

15:39.580 --> 15:46.569
taking on the whole country, which meant that I couldn't possibly pay the attention.

15:46.609 --> 15:52.317
On a nickel and diamonds, I decided to get rid of everything except the major major and the major minor.

15:53.078 --> 16:04.493
The second factor was that I began in the same time, less interested in the writings that these writers were doing, and created in the new ones.

16:06.856 --> 16:09.199
And that was the idea of these artificial rarities.

16:10.799 --> 16:19.289
which made my collecting not only more expensive, but that I couldn't keep working, and more coming all the time.

16:20.651 --> 16:32.364
And very high prices, which was $50, $60, which as you know now is low, but even in the 70s, especially the poetry.

16:32.384 --> 16:34.667
Why did you succumb to the extra hilarious?

16:35.368 --> 16:37.711
Because either I'm going to collect these people or I'm not.

16:38.371 --> 16:39.793
Yeah, but you don't have to collect

16:39.908 --> 16:42.491
I don't have to do anything, but that's my decision.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.613
But we're talking about, I collect authors.

16:45.774 --> 16:49.138
I don't buy the signed limited.

16:49.158 --> 16:50.659
I do not admit them to my shelves.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.042
I'm interested in the first trade.

16:53.062 --> 16:56.645
I'm interested in what has gone out into the marketplace and affects people's lives.

16:57.406 --> 16:59.088
But that's your decision.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.591
That's why I don't even mind getting a first edition with a remainder stamp.

17:02.852 --> 17:04.133
Your decision and your money.

17:04.593 --> 17:08.137
My money is spent the way I want to spend my money.

17:08.217 --> 17:09.038
We're talking money here.

17:10.047 --> 17:12.229
So why collect something which you detested?

17:12.289 --> 17:14.351
Why not continue to collect something which you enjoy?

17:14.371 --> 17:15.932
I detested those items.

17:16.413 --> 17:17.754
I didn't detest what was in them.

17:20.196 --> 17:22.619
I didn't detest the quality of the material in the item.

17:22.759 --> 17:25.962
I just detested the idea that these things were going to be in profusion.

17:26.823 --> 17:27.443
That's the point.

17:27.543 --> 17:29.165
They were schemes to make money.

17:31.046 --> 17:31.267
Yeah.

17:31.967 --> 17:35.250
And I decided to make a statement about it, and I'm not interested.

17:35.451 --> 17:38.113
So would you say basically stop because of these things?

17:39.089 --> 17:40.931
I just told you the reasons I stopped.

17:41.011 --> 17:41.992
But that was a major reason.

17:42.453 --> 17:43.895
First was I was going a new direction.

17:44.675 --> 17:53.506
Second, I was disappointed with the idea that America lifted up with the idea that I'm going somewhere else for literature.

17:53.526 --> 17:57.130
But there's also this factor, the economic factor.

17:57.150 --> 18:02.036
In order to keep up, I was finding I wasn't buying $10 new books and $12.50 new books.

18:02.096 --> 18:04.498
I was buying $100 new books.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.662
And I didn't care for that.

18:08.317 --> 18:15.349
There's a contradiction here, maybe not, but you said on the one hand you want to collect your own time.

18:15.489 --> 18:20.718
On the other hand, the American writers stopped speaking to you.

18:20.738 --> 18:22.000
The collection?

18:22.020 --> 18:25.726
The fact that I was... Disregard the sign limiteds.

18:25.826 --> 18:26.748
What about content?

18:27.569 --> 18:29.312
Where were they failing you as writers?

18:29.798 --> 18:33.824
Well, I think the literature was not as significant as starting in the major works.

18:34.125 --> 18:39.854
If you put value situations on, I think you'll find that they all come out in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, and then they tail off.

18:39.874 --> 18:44.722
If you grew up with finding, it resonates more.

18:44.942 --> 18:48.007
That's possible.

18:48.027 --> 18:51.433
I'm on several levels here, trying to respond to you.

18:51.473 --> 18:53.616
Joel, interested primarily in literary material.

18:53.636 --> 18:57.122
The obvious one that you're here to talk about, which is the collection.

18:57.878 --> 19:00.981
But I'm on several levels besides being a collector.

19:01.042 --> 19:07.849
To collect you don't have to be an intellectual, and to collect you don't have to be real, and we've talked about that.

19:10.152 --> 19:11.714
You don't understand it, but it exists.

19:14.176 --> 19:18.101
Talking about my decisions is why Bellow is a major novelist.

19:18.121 --> 19:24.708
It's based on my collecting them, my investing in them, my knowing them, my this, my that, and then et cetera, et cetera.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.350
It's based on a lot of factors.

19:26.920 --> 19:33.909
It's also based on most of the leading critics will acknowledge that Saul Bellow is the single best novelist writing in America.

19:33.929 --> 19:35.071
Not the single best author.

19:37.194 --> 19:37.734
The novelist.

19:39.256 --> 19:42.200
Which is a little different.

19:42.220 --> 19:55.358
I've been telling my Israeli contacts and my Russian contacts a long time now that if you want to know what happened in America after World War II,

19:55.709 --> 19:57.331
and especially in the 60s.

19:59.793 --> 20:06.359
Essays of Norman Mailer and Jimmy Baldwin, and that's the best material that you could ever hope to read.

20:07.220 --> 20:11.785
The Norman Mailer and Jimmy Baldwin will tell you what happened in the 60s, let's call it the 60s in America.

20:13.046 --> 20:13.647
It's not fiction.

20:14.507 --> 20:16.690
This is not short stories.

20:16.710 --> 20:17.190
This is essays.

20:19.492 --> 20:24.197
I knew that essays are part of literature, and that critical matter is ethics.

20:25.021 --> 20:32.132
I collect it because of the authors being collected.

20:32.152 --> 20:39.322
I can't say that I collect—well, I have—Sven Berkus put out two collections, and I have both of them.

20:39.343 --> 20:45.952
I mean, does that mean I'm— Well, there's only two books, so you probably— Hey, we've authored one book.

20:47.895 --> 20:53.003
The Jewish Publications Society a couple of years ago put together a collection from—put together an Italian guy.

20:54.586 --> 21:04.057
I had an insanely hard-to-achieve collection of all of Henry Roth's periodical pieces.

21:05.960 --> 21:10.465
They were printed in a collection.

21:10.485 --> 21:16.913
Do you ever ask yourself what it's all about?

21:17.594 --> 21:21.218
Do you consider yourself involved within the guidelines of each?

21:21.434 --> 21:23.957
you know, quote, compassion, driving force?

21:24.318 --> 21:26.941
It's all passion.

21:27.102 --> 21:28.183
It's all concentration.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.187
It's all paying attention.

21:33.330 --> 21:39.659
Great lines in Arthur Miller's Jessica Salesman is when the wife says, attention must be paid.

21:41.661 --> 21:42.042
I love it.

21:43.864 --> 21:49.652
It reminds me that you really can't do a lot of attention paying in the world that we live in.

21:50.003 --> 21:53.686
It's easy for me to have the book room and have this backyard.

21:54.247 --> 21:56.669
A lot of people don't have that.

21:56.689 --> 21:58.791
And my father and our kids don't live with us.

21:59.691 --> 22:02.214
I'm interested in something.

22:02.234 --> 22:04.456
I'm a halfway person.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.177
And I'm not a compromiser at all.

22:06.678 --> 22:11.121
I created all of my designs.

22:11.822 --> 22:14.504
I didn't compromise with anybody.

22:14.524 --> 22:17.767
I made some pretty hard-nosed decisions.

22:17.787 --> 22:18.728
I'm keen to relate.

22:19.130 --> 22:28.100
what I call the pieces of book culture, which I see as tragically understated and tragically misunderstood in America, or a little understood and no attention paid.

22:29.322 --> 22:35.008
So as usual, in order to be fanatic about the whole thing, I have to be fanatic about the various parts.

22:35.349 --> 22:41.155
In order to be fanatic about the various parts, it has to be aimed towards something stellar or something.

22:41.175 --> 22:47.803
So I'm trying to talk about the idea that I'm a major fanatic of minor things as well as majors.

22:48.830 --> 23:04.124
I can't stand the idea that my grandchildren, if I'm not careful, are going to be taught how to live in America and function in the society by going to symphonies and art institutes.

23:04.144 --> 23:05.205
I can't be reoriented.

23:05.546 --> 23:08.749
If they want to be a violin player, that's something else.

23:08.769 --> 23:13.093
I still want them to get reading, writing, and arithmetic in school.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.615
I'm not interested in ballet lessons in school.

23:15.855 --> 23:17.757
I'm interested in reading, writing, and arithmetic.

23:18.192 --> 23:21.016
And if they don't get it when they're six, seven, eight, it's going to be too late.

23:21.797 --> 23:23.339
Because it's obvious.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.604
I believe in adult education, by the way.

23:26.664 --> 23:27.546
Adult education.

23:28.387 --> 23:29.248
I think it's too late.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.932
Now, somebody can learn a lot higher.

23:31.952 --> 23:32.573
It's different.

23:32.593 --> 23:36.699
But I really don't believe that he and I is adult education.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.942
I think he and I is pathetic.

23:41.446 --> 23:47.895
To me, because my father had printed matters, that's what passed it on to me.

23:48.179 --> 23:51.524
And we had printed matter when our children were born.

23:51.544 --> 24:08.930
And my daughter's child, single, beginning, and closing the loop, that's probably about the millions of American homes, forget about overseas, that have not one piece of printed matter in the home.

24:08.950 --> 24:09.591
Forget about what?

24:09.611 --> 24:11.935
They don't even have a paper.

24:11.955 --> 24:12.556
I mean, think about it.

24:13.177 --> 24:15.520
The publishers think about this, but they don't know what to do about it.

24:16.462 --> 24:19.105
I think the educators think about this, but they don't know what to do about it.

24:20.006 --> 24:21.227
I think I know what to do about it.

24:22.068 --> 24:22.628
I really do.

24:23.009 --> 24:27.794
I think we can take all the printed matter that we've got around, laying around in warehouses, and put it in these homes.

24:30.256 --> 24:30.857
That's fanatic.

24:34.301 --> 24:35.082
Yeah.

24:36.763 --> 24:39.186
I worry about this.

24:39.226 --> 24:43.070
The difference between sea mail and air mail is tremendous.

24:45.252 --> 24:46.013
You're not even paying

24:46.499 --> 24:51.286
$300 for a book, but I can't suppose to mail one.

24:53.529 --> 25:00.518
I probably will ship it female in order that it all stays there, as opposed to dividing it up with their mail.

25:01.319 --> 25:02.060
I haven't decided yet.

25:02.381 --> 25:08.890
I was thinking of sending all the A authors.

25:08.910 --> 25:10.552
I work with the anthology.

25:10.572 --> 25:13.536
I was thinking of starting with Ewan Amitai and sending him first.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.347
And the problems are deeper than that.

25:19.229 --> 25:23.513
The actual shipping and putting up, to me, is almost nothing.

25:23.533 --> 25:25.495
Don't worry about what's going to happen after it's up.

25:26.395 --> 25:33.162
Authors have committed themselves to me that they'll help me merchandise and use.

25:33.662 --> 25:34.983
What will be limited access?

25:35.003 --> 25:37.065
It's not going to be a circulating library, right?

25:37.145 --> 25:40.589
I'm talking about making appearances here, bringing people into the room.

25:41.269 --> 25:42.831
See what all happens after they're there.

25:43.391 --> 25:45.193
I'm talking about just to get them.

25:47.384 --> 26:05.787
I probably will divide it up into publishing world, things like that, in other words, of the book society, for whatever that means, and then bouncing really interested in bringing people in to start talking in Moscow years ago.

26:08.330 --> 26:14.758
We start with the love of the book, which becomes the use of the book, of the book.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.290
saying that they understood.

26:16.330 --> 26:23.761
The use of the book meant a certain study, and the fascinants were not allowed to study, so then the love of the book, and the love of the book doesn't mean it.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.105
It's the use of the book that counts.

26:26.125 --> 26:26.746
They had applause.

26:26.766 --> 26:30.391
They had about 600 people, and they were going crazy.

26:30.812 --> 26:33.136
On the platform, we're not too happy with the talk.

26:34.197 --> 26:35.299
This is early, you know.

26:36.821 --> 26:37.703
You said earlier that.

26:38.063 --> 26:42.290
Now, would you say— No, it's what we utilize these collections again and again and again.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.952
What bothers me is—

26:44.438 --> 26:46.881
in the Faulkner room where you were yesterday.

26:47.843 --> 26:49.245
How are we going to utilize it?

26:49.545 --> 26:53.170
And I don't need a series of scattered events.

26:53.371 --> 26:56.615
I'd rather have something like this going on.

26:56.956 --> 26:59.379
You know what I mean?

26:59.399 --> 27:01.743
I'd rather have a river than a waterfall.

27:04.106 --> 27:04.827
What do they do?

27:07.190 --> 27:08.472
What the Morgan does, all right?

27:10.936 --> 27:11.897
What does Texas do?

27:13.278 --> 27:16.341
Do they interdisciplinary their healing?

27:16.861 --> 27:19.804
Or do they just reach out to whoever's interested in this research?

27:21.205 --> 27:23.287
It's almost unheard of.

27:23.307 --> 27:26.630
The university pay any attention to the collection of leading questions.

27:26.650 --> 27:29.393
Yeah, I have to say, I think, yeah.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.937
Which bottom line results in the, it being in?

27:34.497 --> 27:36.319
The Humanities Research Center.

27:36.339 --> 27:37.040
That's the name.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.421
The opposite of research.

27:41.544 --> 27:42.124
What is this?

27:42.444 --> 27:43.065
And what?

27:43.585 --> 27:45.147
Does it mean in the culture?

27:45.227 --> 27:50.955
You see, the Texas Library, in fact, very printed books are almost irrelevant to what they have at the HRC.

27:50.995 --> 27:51.616
You want another one?

27:51.636 --> 27:52.597
We've got a whole thing for.

27:52.757 --> 27:54.579
Is that a good Mexican beer?

27:54.660 --> 27:55.561
I love it.

27:55.581 --> 27:57.844
I probably will have another, but I'm not going to have it.

27:57.864 --> 27:59.186
Is that a good Mexican beer?

27:59.206 --> 27:59.806
It's wonderful, yeah.

27:59.826 --> 28:01.088
And I don't know beer in a minute.

28:01.108 --> 28:05.734
Surely knows that's a good one.

28:05.754 --> 28:06.896
We've covered a lot, you know.

28:06.916 --> 28:08.678
Let me just shut this up for a second.

28:08.698 --> 28:09.159
We grew.

28:10.180 --> 28:10.380
All right.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.702
This is a good idea.

28:14.753 --> 28:22.482
I've established that I'm not way off by saying there's two major themes of the future.

28:24.084 --> 28:25.265
One is man and society.

28:28.829 --> 28:29.870
And these are the Soviets.

28:32.233 --> 28:39.701
I really believe there's a higher theme is the nature of good and evil in man.

28:40.002 --> 28:44.727
This is not original with me, but a derivative of somebody, sometime, someplace.

28:44.943 --> 28:45.804
I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

28:45.824 --> 28:52.835
I've always thought that a novel whose theme, the nature of good and evil and rare, is standard than a novel man in society.

28:55.138 --> 28:58.403
Partly because it's more individualistic.

28:58.423 --> 29:00.587
And it isn't moaning.

29:02.429 --> 29:03.411
And it flies high.

29:03.792 --> 29:05.875
I prefer to think of Faulkner's theme.

29:07.677 --> 29:12.705
Paul Bello, who I think is the best living American novelist, read it.

29:14.930 --> 29:29.372
I try to operate under that and use that in my interactions in the publishing, selling, reading, educating, listing, utilization.

29:30.193 --> 29:33.518
I try to think about that all the time.

29:33.538 --> 29:36.702
And I try to be all of that myself.

29:37.183 --> 29:40.448
In other words, as an individual, of course, I'm doing this all on my own.

29:42.588 --> 29:48.576
as I'm entitled to, but I'm also, it's my burden.

29:48.796 --> 29:51.419
Think of these two great themes, and I try to use them.

29:52.420 --> 29:57.607
Because the man in society, you understand, I'm right up against the library society.

29:57.627 --> 30:05.657
The library society is really not interested in what I'm doing, because it interferes a little bit in the way they see there.

30:05.697 --> 30:12.105
The nature of good and evil in man is a real, well, they're both political.

30:12.608 --> 30:15.411
But the nature of good is your major corridor.

30:17.113 --> 30:21.898
The idea that a human being is composed of both is serious stuff.

30:21.938 --> 30:27.203
This goes into censorship in the use of the books and what to do with them.

30:27.223 --> 30:29.786
Reading is something that I think was.

30:31.388 --> 30:37.775
You offered your books and profits to the public library, the air public library, and I'm sure they would have been thrilled to take them.

30:37.795 --> 30:38.415
I didn't offer.

30:39.476 --> 30:40.978
What I did was... You explored.

30:42.899 --> 30:48.685
I went to them after I had offered them to Library of Congress.

30:48.705 --> 30:51.608
They wanted the material that I subsequently sold.

30:52.409 --> 30:54.891
They didn't want the material that I subsequently gave.

30:55.092 --> 30:56.373
What material did you sell?

30:57.254 --> 30:58.455
The rest.

30:58.475 --> 30:58.976
The letters.

30:59.276 --> 31:00.437
Well, why didn't you give them that?

31:03.621 --> 31:07.244
Which does not research reach them.

31:07.364 --> 31:10.087
Yeah, but the Library of Congress— I'm not interested in the scholars.

31:10.748 --> 31:11.809
Let them go to Virginia.

31:12.650 --> 31:15.035
They came to my house anyway and looked at my stuff years ago.

31:16.479 --> 31:19.365
They're not coming to Michigan to look at the same stuff they saw in my house years ago.

31:19.385 --> 31:20.147
Go to Washington.

31:21.850 --> 31:22.953
You're not interested in the scholars.

31:22.973 --> 31:25.438
They might not go anywhere to see my stuff.

31:25.458 --> 31:26.020
Let's go back.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.563
Why aren't you interested in the scholars?

31:29.989 --> 31:31.131
Let's stay for tech.

31:31.448 --> 31:37.457
I said, I'm not interested in the scholars coming to see the same material that they've seen right in.

31:37.537 --> 31:39.480
I didn't say I'm not interested in the scholars, period.

31:39.500 --> 31:43.025
Yeah, but the scholars is a big material.

31:43.045 --> 31:49.174
Well, the scholars of the next generation haven't had an opportunity to see their material.

31:49.234 --> 31:58.728
I didn't consider my material to be... They must have considered it enough because they wanted it.

31:58.748 --> 32:00.090
I was working for them.

32:00.872 --> 32:01.152
Did you...

32:01.418 --> 32:01.959
Not for it.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.040
For me.

32:03.641 --> 32:05.704
Yeah, for money.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.326
Yeah, but not the University of Michigan.

32:07.346 --> 32:08.888
It was my decision.

32:08.948 --> 32:12.273
It wasn't a monetary decision, because I don't think money.

32:12.353 --> 32:16.598
I mean, if you sold the materials to Peter, I'm not concerned.

32:16.618 --> 32:17.439
I'm very honest with you.

32:19.362 --> 32:22.366
Found it housed.

32:22.406 --> 32:25.350
I felt so good that some of this stuff went back into the marketplace.

32:25.870 --> 32:34.138
both because of the value situation and some of the collectors would have it, and made interest in Faulkner and renewed interest with the booksellers and renewed interest.

32:34.158 --> 32:35.820
I really had my guess.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.462
Well, that's a good answer.

32:37.482 --> 32:41.966
Possible that that, however, was the most valuable stuff in the collection?

32:41.986 --> 32:44.769
Marble Fawn transcended a single script.

32:45.009 --> 32:48.212
The total number of scripts transcended the Marble Fawn.

32:48.853 --> 32:50.775
How many scripts did you have?

32:50.835 --> 32:54.619
I think you sold most of it on block, which is why it got more money.

32:54.819 --> 32:55.860
Who bought it?

32:56.667 --> 32:57.308
You think L.D.

32:57.348 --> 32:57.608
got it?

32:58.009 --> 32:58.370
I don't know.

32:59.551 --> 33:00.192
I don't want to know.

33:00.212 --> 33:00.573
I forgot.

33:00.613 --> 33:01.735
If you told me, I forgot.

33:01.815 --> 33:03.177
And I don't think I asked.

33:03.197 --> 33:03.898
I don't think you told me.

33:06.462 --> 33:10.408
But I don't really care who gets things.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.251
My fun is that it got back.

33:13.393 --> 33:14.915
What I don't care about is who got it.

33:15.836 --> 33:18.480
Well, you like to think that they went to a nice home, don't you think?

33:18.541 --> 33:19.502
I don't care.

33:19.887 --> 33:25.493
Well, what if it's some clown that's going to destroy it, or pangs of loss?

33:25.974 --> 33:27.836
What I have, my father taught me years ago.

33:28.717 --> 33:29.878
Don't worry about things you have.

33:29.938 --> 33:33.102
You try to divest yourself of these things.

33:33.122 --> 33:33.843
I didn't care what one.

33:34.504 --> 33:35.965
You didn't even, never mind that.

33:36.186 --> 33:40.831
It didn't hurt you when they, you didn't pine over their loss, so to speak.

33:41.712 --> 33:42.993
I told you, I've never read books.

33:43.013 --> 33:44.575
The machine wasn't running.

33:44.595 --> 33:49.501
I never, never, never pine over or had him divest it.

33:49.521 --> 33:49.641
Never.

33:50.279 --> 33:53.183
There's nothing you said, ah, darn, I wish I had that back.

33:53.363 --> 33:53.584
No.

33:54.244 --> 34:06.121
Peter Howard said to me once, I'd do $400 for a book if I only wanted to pay on a paper slur, and that took a decision-making.

34:06.201 --> 34:14.452
Along with what I said to you at breakfast, if I don't haggle, and I only got one option, leave it.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.617
Well, the option to not buying it is leaving it.

34:17.637 --> 34:18.598
So he calls it merciful.

34:19.203 --> 34:22.967
Because he understands that my decision is based on decisions.

34:22.987 --> 34:25.130
I want to pay it or I don't want to pay it.

34:25.170 --> 34:26.351
And I don't care to discuss it.

34:26.992 --> 34:28.574
Because I really don't know what I'm doing anyway.

34:29.054 --> 34:31.037
But I know now you've got to make a decision.

34:31.057 --> 34:32.078
Have you ever planned that?

34:32.098 --> 34:33.179
He calls that merciless.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.323
And he says, I'm known for that.

34:36.343 --> 34:37.804
You never know why I don't buy it.

34:38.986 --> 34:39.186
Never.

34:39.727 --> 34:39.847
Why?

34:39.867 --> 34:43.551
Because I'm unable to communicate that to them.

34:43.571 --> 34:46.054
Because I really don't know myself why I don't buy it or not buy it.

34:46.287 --> 34:48.530
Do you know why you don't want to buy an item?

34:48.631 --> 34:49.592
Come on.

34:49.612 --> 34:50.453
You can make it up.

34:50.814 --> 34:53.378
What I'm saying is... You can verbalize it, but you don't know.

34:53.478 --> 34:59.006
What if you desperately want the item, but you're saying, I won't get it because I don't want to pay that price?

34:59.026 --> 34:59.727
Is that what you're saying?

35:00.068 --> 35:01.510
The market decision that you have to make?

35:02.151 --> 35:06.297
Yeah, but a lot of us will say, I know I shouldn't, but I will anyway.

35:06.317 --> 35:09.122
I do, but then I've decided to buy it, and then why discuss it?

35:09.783 --> 35:14.290
I don't discuss why I buy it, and I don't discuss why I don't buy it.

35:14.310 --> 35:15.231
And that's called merciless.

35:15.751 --> 35:17.493
You understand I cross the line.

35:17.553 --> 35:20.156
I do from time to time, but I try not to.

35:20.176 --> 35:22.179
And I'm known for that.

35:24.642 --> 35:25.063
That's it.

35:25.163 --> 35:26.685
Don't discuss it.

35:27.886 --> 35:29.728
Toby wants to buy it or he doesn't want to buy it.

35:29.848 --> 35:36.617
Have you ever... I'd rather spend my time talking about the material than the decision-making.

35:36.637 --> 35:36.937
I hate it.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.484
On a single item, I don't want to discuss it with you generally, how you make decisions.

35:43.662 --> 35:48.628
Do you want to talk about how the collectors decide whether to buy or not, right?

35:48.648 --> 35:50.090
And my answer to you is, who the hell knows?

35:51.512 --> 35:53.374
It's an emotional experience.

35:53.394 --> 35:54.135
We talked about that.

35:54.796 --> 36:01.064
Did you ever feel, when you had those 350 offers that you were collecting, that you had to have everything they did, right?

36:01.224 --> 36:04.408
I knew I couldn't.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.010
Did you come close to success?

36:06.791 --> 36:10.736
Did Phillips have everything in the wall?

36:11.096 --> 36:11.897
So, did he?

36:12.856 --> 36:13.697
Still didn't.

36:13.717 --> 36:13.937
No.

36:14.278 --> 36:15.680
So that's my answer to it.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.362
It doesn't matter whether I want to or no one wants to.

36:17.382 --> 36:19.585
Of course you want to.

36:19.605 --> 36:20.566
And of course you know you can.

36:21.508 --> 36:24.331
Because you never know about what it is that you haven't seen.

36:24.351 --> 36:30.720
You don't know what exists that was put out seraphicially or private or pirated or derogged.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.322
It's an ongoing event anyway.

36:32.342 --> 36:32.803
It's life.

36:33.183 --> 36:35.246
This is a life function.

36:35.286 --> 36:36.348
It's not a death function.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.649
You're a very rational man.

36:37.689 --> 36:38.631
I know, very.

36:38.651 --> 36:41.074
I thought you were collecting, but this is an irrational passion.

36:42.252 --> 36:44.275
The collecting of books.

36:44.755 --> 36:45.576
Do you agree with that?

36:46.257 --> 36:48.219
No, because it's not the collecting of books.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.644
Any collecting is rational.

36:51.664 --> 36:53.026
Looking towards immortality.

36:53.326 --> 36:54.127
We've talked about that.

36:54.147 --> 36:59.474
It's artifacts that supposedly will make you immortal, that you leave design and make you immortal.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.296
It's artifacts.

37:01.756 --> 37:10.167
This is partly the reason why you insist that the books that you do give together as

37:11.024 --> 37:16.009
The only reason why I insist on it, because I see that as what I have in my own house.

37:16.149 --> 37:21.093
If I see that's what I have in my own house, and that's what I want to turn it over, I would say that's the only reason.

37:21.814 --> 37:26.418
The idea that it's comprehensive is rationalizing.

37:26.438 --> 37:28.020
The only reason, then, is immortality.

37:30.462 --> 37:36.868
Lee Holtzman, even though you say you don't want your name on it, that's kind of contradictory in a way.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.812
You don't want your name on it on the one hand, but yet you want it to...

37:41.045 --> 37:45.330
remain under the terms that you developed it.

37:45.410 --> 37:50.455
I mean, this is Toby Holtzman's conception of the William Schwarzenegger archive.

37:50.575 --> 37:53.639
And if you don't agree to keep it... Lubrotsky came to the same conclusion.

37:53.799 --> 37:56.702
Lubrotsky says it's going to be kept together.

37:56.822 --> 37:57.783
Or it doesn't go to Yale.

37:58.063 --> 37:59.525
Or it doesn't go anywhere.

37:59.745 --> 38:06.532
And it went to Cape Girardeau down in... He'll have two people a year visit him.

38:06.573 --> 38:08.875
I'll have more people visit me than he...

38:09.445 --> 38:11.508
I mean, there's also money involved with him, too.

38:11.528 --> 38:13.029
Yeah, he's the curator.

38:13.130 --> 38:14.912
Lifetime curator, too.

38:14.932 --> 38:16.434
Yeah, and he wouldn't even curate with me.

38:16.934 --> 38:18.536
He wouldn't even curate with my curator.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.200
What do you think that is?

38:21.220 --> 38:22.181
What's he doing all day long?

38:22.261 --> 38:22.842
Sleeping?

38:23.102 --> 38:24.904
He's writing poetry.

38:24.924 --> 38:31.893
He said to me one day in Oxford, hold mine under his, and he'll make a good deal for me.

38:31.913 --> 38:32.433
Offering you money?

38:35.377 --> 38:39.402
Based on how much material I had versus how much material he had.

38:40.006 --> 38:41.748
It would be called the L.D.

38:41.848 --> 38:42.409
Brodsky Collection.

38:42.429 --> 38:42.830
Whatever.

38:43.270 --> 38:47.636
But Toby Holtzman wouldn't be part of that.

38:47.656 --> 38:47.977
So what?

38:48.197 --> 38:51.161
Either way, what's in it?

38:51.181 --> 38:52.863
I don't like the idea of South-East Preservation.

38:52.943 --> 38:53.604
I'm not sure.

38:54.205 --> 38:55.727
I've been down there.

38:55.747 --> 38:59.352
I've been down there last year.

38:59.372 --> 38:59.953
It's a staple.

39:00.634 --> 39:02.116
He's not in his own building.

39:02.176 --> 39:03.618
He told me he was going to be in his own building.

39:04.098 --> 39:06.081
He told me he was going to be in his own building.

39:06.365 --> 39:07.627
He does have a room.

39:07.827 --> 39:10.832
Bigger than my room in Michigan?

39:10.852 --> 39:12.654
I don't have the whole room, but bigger than that room?

39:13.195 --> 39:15.879
No, smaller, but he basically has the whole room that he's in.

39:17.321 --> 39:17.722
Oh, sad.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.206
Basically.

39:20.226 --> 39:20.626
First he does.

39:20.807 --> 39:22.749
Well, I'm trying to think of it because I took some pictures.

39:22.769 --> 39:23.991
He doesn't share it with anything.

39:24.592 --> 39:26.595
Well, it was somebody else's office.

39:27.256 --> 39:30.882
It was somebody else's room, and then it was the president's room, and then it became his room.

39:30.902 --> 39:31.883
Same argument I have in Israel.

39:32.251 --> 39:36.255
I wanted an adjacent little office, which they decided has two doors.

39:36.475 --> 39:42.101
Of course, they locked my side and opened the other side, and I said, do it the other way, walking through somebody they're working.

39:42.121 --> 39:47.967
Now, is this thing all set your Israeli thing, or are there still some place to be dotted and some T's to be crossed?

39:48.047 --> 39:51.810
Well, is the International Conference set?

39:51.830 --> 39:54.633
I would say, in principle, that's the word they use.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.555
Israelis say, in principle, we want to be there.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.497
I want any PLO.

39:58.737 --> 39:59.238
Why should they?

39:59.878 --> 40:01.140
And they'd be from Tunis.

40:01.160 --> 40:01.600
Why should they?

40:02.457 --> 40:04.779
People who live in West Bangla, guys.

40:06.061 --> 40:06.901
And what's your reaction to that?

40:06.921 --> 40:08.042
That's what they're going to get.

40:08.063 --> 40:10.385
So you're going to pull the PLO stuff out.

40:10.405 --> 40:11.106
What?

40:11.126 --> 40:13.528
So you are going to pull the PLO stuff out.

40:14.609 --> 40:17.372
I'm talking about their stand on this piece.

40:17.392 --> 40:18.613
I'm not talking about collection.

40:18.633 --> 40:18.853
I'm sorry.

40:19.113 --> 40:21.115
Well, that's what it sounded like.

40:21.135 --> 40:25.500
No, I'm talking about their stand.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.102
And I respect that because... I thought you were talking about the books.

40:28.162 --> 40:28.983
No, I'm sorry.

40:29.063 --> 40:30.945
No, no, no, no, no.

40:31.988 --> 40:36.172
I'm talking about their stand, and I'm relating that to the word in principle.

40:36.593 --> 40:38.294
You asked me, in principle, am I all set?

40:38.775 --> 40:40.337
Or I said, in principle, I'm all set.

40:41.538 --> 40:42.699
But I don't have any contract.

40:44.681 --> 40:46.042
I'm afraid to put it down in writing.

40:46.102 --> 40:47.904
I'm afraid to put it down in writing.

40:48.385 --> 40:51.228
I want them to present it to me, and then I'll approve it and change it.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.869
That's what I did in Michigan.

40:55.092 --> 40:55.652
You know the book?

40:56.433 --> 40:57.674
I'm the seller and you're the buyer.

40:58.455 --> 41:00.477
And here's the book, and neither one of us know what we're doing.

41:01.823 --> 41:05.047
and you say how much you want for it, and I say, well, how much you're giving me for it?

41:05.807 --> 41:07.409
You want the other one to talk first?

41:07.790 --> 41:09.231
So what we're doing is negotiating.

41:10.112 --> 41:14.517
Yeah, so what I'm doing is, and I say we're successful at Michigan, and do the same thing there.

41:15.698 --> 41:21.224
I let the university put on one or two pages what it is that they want me to sign.

41:23.146 --> 41:28.332
Meaning, what are they going to do, and what are they going to fix?

41:28.392 --> 41:29.974
Basically, as a form of a

41:30.258 --> 41:30.899
What do they call it?

41:30.919 --> 41:33.943
A codicil or a... I don't know what that even is called.

41:36.126 --> 41:36.546
Legally.

41:37.147 --> 41:37.748
I don't know.

41:37.768 --> 41:39.109
It don't amount to raw beans.

41:40.331 --> 41:40.692
Forget it.

41:40.832 --> 41:41.573
You know what I mean?

41:41.593 --> 41:43.575
Then I die and the paper's worthless anyway.

41:44.136 --> 41:45.177
Because it was done for me.

41:45.217 --> 41:46.459
It wasn't done for my ears.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.143
Right?

41:49.163 --> 41:50.404
I don't know if I can put on there.

41:50.624 --> 41:59.556
Well, you'd be hopeful that the writers who have become a part of this will work to... Well, my problem is that I don't think I can get it down on paper.

42:00.835 --> 42:04.359
So my idea is that I can't put what I want on paper.

42:04.379 --> 42:07.723
So what I did was, I left the University of Michigan and it came out pretty good.

42:09.404 --> 42:12.528
How strong are Michigan Special Collections in other areas?

42:12.908 --> 42:13.929
Greatest.

42:16.092 --> 42:16.592
In America.

42:17.814 --> 42:18.234
Papyri.

42:20.557 --> 42:22.199
Papyri.

42:22.639 --> 42:23.380
I don't know it.

42:23.400 --> 42:27.284
This is before printed Gutenberg.

42:27.304 --> 42:28.125
Oh, papyri.

42:28.865 --> 42:30.147
I call it Papyri.

42:30.187 --> 42:31.549
P-A-P-Y-R-I.

42:31.629 --> 42:32.451
I call it Papyri.

42:33.813 --> 42:34.414
Okay.

42:34.434 --> 42:36.738
Who gave it up?

42:36.758 --> 42:39.282
Somebody at the university accepted it.

42:39.302 --> 42:40.183
That's good stuff.

42:41.966 --> 42:49.779
We're talking about, with the exception of that being listed in their brochures and in their promotional material, nobody knows about it.

42:49.819 --> 42:51.963
Probably the Papyri people do.

42:52.664 --> 42:53.946
If you ask me, what are they?

42:55.128 --> 42:55.969
It's pretty neat.

42:58.075 --> 42:58.976
You're pretty elegant.

43:00.218 --> 43:02.342
You're about pre-Gutenberg.

43:02.742 --> 43:04.545
You're way pre-Gutenberg.

43:04.565 --> 43:05.767
You're about classic.

43:05.807 --> 43:07.931
You're talking about 2,500-year-old stuff.

43:08.051 --> 43:08.872
I don't want to be quoted.

43:10.134 --> 43:13.800
But Tom Garich, who's the head of Special Collections at the University of St.

43:13.820 --> 43:16.504
Paul Faulkner, you know, and I've been operating on him for years.

43:17.085 --> 43:21.693
And I had him up as my guest for the dedication day.

43:22.494 --> 43:23.796
We spoke with the money.

43:24.552 --> 43:28.676
a bunch of papers that they found under the stairs at Rauno.

43:29.176 --> 43:35.683
They called the Faulkner Papers, with poems and bracelets.

43:35.723 --> 43:39.386
Who got that, Texas?

43:39.406 --> 43:40.247
Mississippi.

43:40.748 --> 43:42.950
They went and sold a papyri.

43:43.090 --> 43:43.791
Oh, yeah, listen.

43:43.811 --> 43:50.337
They went and sold a papyri collection to get the money to buy the Faulkner.

43:50.357 --> 43:51.098
You follow me now?

43:51.658 --> 43:51.798
Yes.

43:51.818 --> 43:53.440
And then it's the same.

43:53.460 --> 43:54.441
Deaccessioning.

43:54.893 --> 43:55.356
I have.

43:56.322 --> 43:57.046
What do you think of that?

43:57.992 --> 44:01.090
I don't think about it at all.
