WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:07.858
Because I think he speaks to you a lot of things.

00:07.878 --> 00:12.042
Well, I'm curious now, when you talk about cultural development, what do you do?

00:12.242 --> 00:14.064
Okay.

00:15.345 --> 00:20.791
We have... What do you mean, saying cultural development?

00:20.811 --> 00:24.695
We mean, essentially, for the public, three things.

00:25.516 --> 00:27.238
First, exhibitions.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.202
Second, publications.

00:32.380 --> 00:37.088
Third, manifestation, I mean conference, collocs and concerts.

00:41.476 --> 00:57.004
We intend to, through exhibition, to show a larger public the collections, because our collections are precious and are hidden.

00:57.575 --> 01:00.099
They are hidden in the library.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.886
They are for the researchers, not for the open public.

01:05.988 --> 01:18.707
The exhibition gives us the occasion to show a larger public the wealthiness of our collection.

01:19.047 --> 01:26.839
It's like the...

01:29.215 --> 01:55.186
It's in a way the perpetuation of the mission of the Enlightenment, because when the French Revolution took place in France, the revolutionaries told, let's give to the people the chance to see the operas of the national genius.

01:56.928 --> 01:58.530
We do the same in a way.

01:59.118 --> 02:06.149
to get out the crypt, like grotte, the crypt, you know?

02:07.250 --> 02:21.993
To get out, there's things closed, locked.

02:23.034 --> 02:24.096
I can't speak French.

02:24.734 --> 02:24.994
No.

02:25.315 --> 02:29.279
No, because I... Your English is better than me.

02:29.299 --> 02:29.640
No.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.022
Your English is perfect.

02:31.182 --> 02:32.583
Your English is wonderful.

02:32.603 --> 02:39.412
I can understand a little bit French, but I prefer your English, which is much better for us.

02:40.713 --> 02:41.014
Merci.

02:43.016 --> 02:50.505
The first exhibition is to make visible

02:51.346 --> 03:18.737
things which are usually invisible for a large public, like treasures in ancient cathedrals, you know, crypton treasures, like in the royal palace, the private collection after the revolution have been back

03:19.257 --> 03:20.178
to the people.

03:22.580 --> 03:25.443
But that's a general purpose.

03:25.463 --> 03:36.093
But our purpose is to, through exhibition, to say something to the public about the library.

03:37.234 --> 03:44.421
Our national library is encyclopedic.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.644
Therefore, the collection of

03:48.113 --> 04:07.199
of such a library are dispatched in books, manuscripts, images, stamps, costumes, decor of opera and theatre.

04:08.220 --> 04:11.084
Many objects, very different.

04:11.444 --> 04:18.053
Through exhibition, we say to the public, see how different are the objects

04:18.387 --> 04:22.090
we gather and collect.

04:22.111 --> 04:23.051
First.

04:23.071 --> 04:34.622
And second is to say to the public, a library, a national library like us, is a certain view about the knowledge today.

04:35.303 --> 04:38.546
It's a certain image of the knowledge today.

04:39.387 --> 04:48.175
It's an encyclopedia in a way of organizing the different knowledge

04:48.509 --> 04:52.674
one respecting the others.

04:54.235 --> 05:15.259
For example, here we have four, maybe Frédéric told you, four fields are on literature, philosophy and history, legal and politics, and science and techniques.

05:15.948 --> 05:21.313
Our encyclopedia is organized around four fields.

05:22.555 --> 05:23.556
That's four fields.

05:24.096 --> 05:35.107
Through exhibition, we intend to make visible a certain vision of the knowledge.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.693
You used the word encyclopedia in a very interesting way.

05:40.913 --> 05:43.035
How do you use the word encyclopedia?

05:43.538 --> 06:04.938
Encyclopedia means first to have a lot of entire... how do this... It's to organize knowledge and to gather things very different.

06:05.999 --> 06:11.824
Encyclopedia... the dream of the totality of things.

06:12.091 --> 06:19.929
And the other dream is the dream of organizing all this totality.

06:20.931 --> 06:24.700
Organizing the totality.

06:25.422 --> 06:28.487
It's not a superficial collection.

06:28.527 --> 06:34.896
It's a very detailed, deep, and very spread up.

06:35.036 --> 06:37.560
Sweeping, widespread.

06:37.620 --> 06:38.481
Comprehensive.

06:38.722 --> 06:40.044
Comprehensive.

06:41.265 --> 06:48.456
We are comprehensive and extensive to organize this horizontality.

06:48.817 --> 06:52.442
I've never seen the word encyclopedic years before with

06:52.810 --> 06:56.474
with regard to a national library policy.

06:56.495 --> 06:57.416
So it is very interesting.

06:57.496 --> 07:19.763
Because when you do an encyclopedia, like Diderot and d'Alembert in 1918, you try to gather a certain amount of knowledge of the time to organize through

07:20.620 --> 07:27.330
things or through an absence of order like alphabetical order.

07:32.357 --> 07:40.108
We, with this partition, in four partition, we try to organize this.

07:40.208 --> 07:48.720
The library could be conceived, perceived like an encyclopedia.

07:49.460 --> 08:03.260
It is a big encyclopedia where you walk through the space like walking through the pages.

08:05.002 --> 08:07.165
When you think of the design of this building,

08:07.634 --> 08:10.357
It is walking through a book, isn't it?

08:10.777 --> 08:35.461
Well, yeah, they said that, for example, the four things at the library command few rooms, like chapters of the knowledge, both from chapter to chapter to chapter.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.041
That's good.

08:36.061 --> 08:36.662
That's nice.

08:37.638 --> 08:41.543
Does this represent a change in national policy?

08:42.004 --> 08:58.647
Would you say this has always been the policy of the French government, to have an encyclopedic library which you're quite aggressively trying to go out and invite the general population to participate?

08:58.667 --> 09:00.190
I don't think it's always been that case.

09:00.450 --> 09:00.851
No.

09:02.433 --> 09:06.919
We have been always, for four centuries,

09:07.321 --> 09:22.310
encyclopedia for the collections, but we, if you, encyclopedia is to gather, to organize, and to give the people, to give the public.

09:23.352 --> 09:23.652
You know?

09:24.654 --> 09:30.325
Three, gather, organize the knowledge, and give the public.

09:30.473 --> 09:38.685
Up till now, we cover, we organize, and some of the public could have access of this encyclopedia.

09:39.867 --> 09:53.047
With exhibitions, we intend to emphasize the access of these encyclopedic collections.

09:56.853 --> 09:58.135
Can you talk about...

09:59.296 --> 10:07.246
We're moving now towards a united Europe in terms of the countries will be closer, currency, trade.

10:07.846 --> 10:21.683
How important is it, while all this is going on, to maintain, and how does the French library work to really retain the identity and the character of the French character, the French identity?

10:22.364 --> 10:24.567
Does the library work to do that?

10:25.408 --> 10:28.932
To maintain a sense of your national heritage?

10:29.840 --> 10:38.487
while you are moving at the same time towards a united Europe in a political and a... Ah, okay, okay.

10:38.507 --> 10:38.788
Yes.

10:40.569 --> 10:42.731
It's a general philosophical question.

10:42.751 --> 10:53.480
The more we go towards Europe, the more you maintain and confirm and affirm the national heritage.

10:55.462 --> 10:59.425
For example, for numerization, digitalization.

11:00.080 --> 11:19.849
Many plans, but Yannick Meunier maybe could speak about it, but tomorrow morning Jacqueline Sanson could speak about it, but the... Excuse me.

11:19.869 --> 11:20.349
Back on.

11:20.450 --> 11:28.281
You're talking about the more Europe becomes the same economically,

11:29.071 --> 11:34.119
the more important it is that you retain your individual identity.

11:34.459 --> 11:37.904
And you said that this is part of the expression of that.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.168
Yes.

11:45.095 --> 11:53.728
For example, I'm not quite sure

11:54.367 --> 12:02.798
This question could be asked to Jacqueline Sanson, because she's more engaged in this process.

12:06.984 --> 12:07.445
Okay.

12:13.914 --> 12:22.365
The books, when we were at the British Library in March, they are now moving 10,000 books a day over to the British Library.

12:22.565 --> 12:24.268
When do you start your... Oh, yes.

12:25.189 --> 12:28.374
Excuse me, but Jacqueline Samson is... She's the person.

12:28.394 --> 12:38.630
It is a person specialized, because she's the director of the 12 millions of books, and she organized the animation of the movie.

12:39.372 --> 12:43.258
Excuse me, I'm not so... I'm not competent.

12:43.278 --> 12:44.640
She's the one.

12:45.667 --> 12:55.678
Because the other fields are covered by other people, I don't want to speak about this.

12:58.681 --> 13:03.706
We organize our exhibition by a typology of exhibitions.

13:04.307 --> 13:12.636
First is encyclopedic exhibitions, where we try to show

13:13.139 --> 13:21.349
the widespread collections, in the sense I told you.

13:22.290 --> 13:28.297
Second is an exhibition more educational.

13:30.199 --> 13:34.624
We intend to do a

13:35.262 --> 13:44.774
A five long court exhibition, I mean five years of exhibition about the L'écrit.

13:49.240 --> 13:49.901
L'écrit.

13:51.483 --> 13:51.723
Where?

13:51.903 --> 13:52.504
The written?

13:53.445 --> 13:54.587
Yeah, L'écrit.

13:54.607 --> 13:56.008
L'écrit, the written.

13:56.029 --> 13:58.892
L'écrit is writing manuscripts.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.135
Yes, about the written.

14:01.604 --> 14:02.685
That's what I thought you were saying.

14:02.846 --> 14:05.949
The forms of the written things.

14:08.132 --> 14:11.316
We have, therefore, five years of exhibition.

14:11.376 --> 14:16.963
The first will deal with the system of writings.

14:19.246 --> 14:22.951
Mesopotamia, Egypt, etc.

14:22.971 --> 14:25.954
The second would be about the page.

14:27.696 --> 14:31.341
Manuscripts are typed or printed.

14:32.013 --> 14:47.492
The third would be about the support of the writings, the paper, or plastic, or numeric, or all of the things.

14:49.455 --> 14:55.703
Fourth would be, we are not quite sure of the fourth, but the .

14:57.505 --> 15:00.889
Right as well?

15:01.696 --> 15:05.060
O-U-T-I-L.

15:09.185 --> 15:13.611
Like pen, pen on... Instruments.

15:13.631 --> 15:15.153
Instruments.

15:15.193 --> 15:16.815
Learning instruments.

15:18.477 --> 15:19.578
Pens, pencils.

15:19.598 --> 15:19.979
Yes.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.424
Extraordinary.

15:24.444 --> 15:28.429
This is a big exhibition first.

15:28.730 --> 15:34.538
We begin this year with a big exhibition about encyclopedism.

15:36.201 --> 15:40.707
Next year will be about the earth on the sky.

15:42.229 --> 15:44.893
The third will be about the utopia.

15:45.233 --> 15:45.354
Ah.

15:46.155 --> 15:47.136
Okay.

15:47.156 --> 15:49.920
So the environment, I guess, is the other one you're talking about.

15:49.980 --> 15:54.687
The earth and the sky is like... About maps.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.630
Yes, cartography.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.332
Yes, cartography.

15:58.750 --> 16:06.040
It's an image of the earth, image of the sky.

16:06.281 --> 16:09.565
And all wonderful things drawn from your own collections.

16:09.966 --> 16:10.226
Yes.

16:10.747 --> 16:16.174
Now, when you have the exhibitions here, will you bring manuscripts from Richelieu out here?

16:16.234 --> 16:17.236
Yes, yes.

16:17.256 --> 16:19.038
You bring them out here for the exhibition?

16:19.058 --> 16:27.390
Yes, and we do exhibitions together with Richelieu and Tolgec for this big, for example, earth on the sky,

16:27.775 --> 16:32.663
Earth will be there, sky will be here.

16:32.703 --> 16:38.191
Utopia will be with the New York Public Library.

16:38.311 --> 16:39.653
Oh, with Monsieur Leclerc.

16:39.994 --> 16:40.334
Yes.

16:41.456 --> 16:44.661
I am in charge of the Utopia of the 20th century.

16:44.741 --> 16:46.704
Will you be coming to New York?

16:47.045 --> 16:47.285
Yes.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.287
Oh, I'll come see you.

16:48.888 --> 16:49.629
Oh, thank you.

16:49.949 --> 16:51.051
Thank you very much.

16:51.071 --> 16:52.894
You'll have to tell me when you're in New York.

16:53.014 --> 16:54.897
Yes, in autumn.

16:55.062 --> 16:55.743
That's okay.

16:55.763 --> 16:56.845
I will call you.

16:57.245 --> 16:59.749
I've been to New York often.

17:00.270 --> 17:00.891
Oh yeah?

17:00.911 --> 17:03.275
Yes, I'm only three hours from New York.

17:03.295 --> 17:06.680
Anyway, that's it.

17:07.081 --> 17:14.492
Therefore, first big exhibition, encyclopedic exhibition, second educational exhibition.

17:14.512 --> 17:19.720
I'm sorry, it's more monographic and more...

17:20.290 --> 17:27.758
monographic exhibition for about one formed, one collection inside our collections.

17:28.739 --> 17:30.301
This is the first typology.

17:30.981 --> 17:44.435
For the collocs on conference, we organize things about, first, reflection about the writing on the library, the history of library.

17:45.717 --> 17:48.880
Second is,

17:49.130 --> 17:57.980
about geopolitical problems of the contemporary world.

17:59.201 --> 18:13.436
For example, we made a cycle of conference, a series of conference, about the crisis of democracy.

18:13.456 --> 18:18.782
In autumn, we will deal with the future of China.

18:19.150 --> 18:26.798
And next year we will deal with ecology.

18:26.978 --> 18:31.182
It's more political problems.

18:34.986 --> 18:37.589
Third thing is lectures.

18:38.069 --> 18:40.392
We do lectures.

18:43.955 --> 18:44.836
I mean readings.

18:45.497 --> 18:47.419
It's readings.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.582
Not lecture, reading.

18:48.602 --> 18:54.070
Now, for the exhibitions, do you develop the ideas for these, or do you talk to your librarians?

18:54.150 --> 18:57.055
Who comes up with the ideas for the materials?

18:57.075 --> 18:57.495
Together.

18:58.016 --> 19:00.460
And could you tell us a little bit about your own background?

19:00.841 --> 19:03.024
Are you a librarian?

19:03.284 --> 19:08.873
No, I made a school, a high school here.

19:08.893 --> 19:12.158
I don't know if you know, it's École Normale Supérieure.

19:13.370 --> 19:15.753
It doesn't give you any idea.

19:15.973 --> 19:19.797
It's high school.

19:21.359 --> 19:27.585
I mean, it's... I can't explain.

19:30.689 --> 19:35.794
I'm just curious about your... I'm specialized in antiques.

19:36.295 --> 19:37.556
Ah, antiquities.

19:37.656 --> 19:39.138
Antiquities.

19:39.158 --> 19:40.099
Greek, Latin.

19:40.319 --> 19:41.200
Oh, really?

19:41.652 --> 19:45.556
So you've been brought into a book environment, though.

19:45.957 --> 19:47.459
Your background is antiquities.

19:48.059 --> 19:49.221
University, yes.

19:49.301 --> 19:52.464
I taught in university Greek and Latin.

19:53.265 --> 19:54.887
And French literature.

19:55.528 --> 19:55.948
I see.

19:57.069 --> 20:09.904
And I'm just curious how you came to work in a library, though, working with the... Because I was interested to spread my things onto...

20:10.154 --> 20:15.882
be involved in things which are a little bit different, you know.

20:16.663 --> 20:21.209
It's difficult in English, actually.

20:21.269 --> 20:23.252
No, it's not good, but, well.

20:23.552 --> 20:25.295
No, it's wonderful.

20:25.315 --> 20:28.479
And I'll talk to you before we, you know, when I write this.

20:28.659 --> 20:32.865
If there are any problems with the quotations, I'll call you and we'll go over some of the things.

20:32.965 --> 20:36.210
Yes, yes, please, because, oh, don't quote me.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.334
Well, it's not good, but, well...

20:39.483 --> 20:40.765
It's perfect.

20:40.785 --> 20:41.226
It's perfect.

20:41.246 --> 20:44.590
But, you know, I'll go over your quotes with you, so you can be happy with them.

20:44.610 --> 20:44.711
Yeah.

20:44.751 --> 20:46.714
So you can be happy with them.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.256
This is your thing?

20:48.276 --> 20:54.204
No, just everything, all the information has been extraordinary.

20:54.224 --> 20:54.845
That's perfect.

20:56.067 --> 21:04.900
So... I think that the best people, I mean, to have the VID is here for the Richelieu.

21:05.302 --> 21:09.307
Here for, those are the two heads.

21:11.190 --> 21:16.357
One for the Richelieu, one for Tolbiac.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.200
Now this is, you can do it tomorrow, right?

21:19.240 --> 21:19.641
Yes.

21:20.002 --> 21:22.044
She deals with the move.

21:22.725 --> 21:26.931
She deals with the collection, the big collection of the printing collection.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.394
She deals with the specialized collection.

21:29.855 --> 21:33.199
She stays at Michelieu, she moves out here.

21:35.339 --> 21:41.026
He is very interesting, very interesting for access informatics.

21:41.226 --> 21:42.247
He is wonderful, yes.

21:43.309 --> 21:49.396
He is interesting about general purpose, about numerization.

21:50.157 --> 21:56.925
And with Frédéric Ramirez, you have a big view about the library.

21:58.272 --> 22:01.557
That is... Yes, of course.

22:01.798 --> 22:21.310
Now... I could give you... Maybe I could... When we'll speak more... If you want to have more precious things, I could quote things more...

22:21.982 --> 22:22.643
You're fine.

22:22.663 --> 22:29.715
But I am not good today because... What is numerization?

22:29.795 --> 22:30.617
What does that mean?

22:30.637 --> 22:31.358
Digitalization.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.281
So that's digitalization.

22:33.321 --> 22:33.782
Yes.

22:33.802 --> 22:36.186
Computer services.

22:36.687 --> 22:42.036
Actually, I should say something to you, but it's very delicate.

22:43.017 --> 22:43.939
Thank you.
