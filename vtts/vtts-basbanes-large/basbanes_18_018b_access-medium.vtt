00:02.107 --> 00:04.310
where I was book editor for a number of years.

00:04.370 --> 00:07.014
How does your wife feel about a house growing?

00:07.034 --> 00:07.836
Well, you know what it is.

00:07.916 --> 00:14.866
It's wonderful because she shares the passion and that's the most dangerous part.

00:15.026 --> 00:24.500
We'll go to these book fairs and we'll see something which is hopelessly expensive but we'll agree that we can't survive without it.

00:24.580 --> 00:27.625
And when you get that kind of a situation,

00:28.077 --> 00:45.225
um but it's you know i couldn't i couldn't imagine being without them i mean they they really are companions and uh we did it we did add a room to the house a couple of years ago i don't know i don't know that i can ever get through uh a day without

00:46.252 --> 00:48.055
browsing among them.

00:48.075 --> 00:51.881
Do you have an agenda, or is it serendipitous each day?

00:51.901 --> 01:10.470
Of course, I have to write books to keep going, and I want to write books, so it isn't completely serendipitous, but I try every day, no matter how tired I am or how quiet I am, to just go and sort of muse among my own shelves and pick up things that I've read and haven't seen for years.

01:10.771 --> 01:14.977
Do you get chills when you pick up something that's particularly exciting or something beautiful?

01:16.640 --> 01:17.902
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:18.002 --> 01:26.554
I don't know, for a lot of complex family reasons, which I won't go into, I'll ever be able to afford to retire from teaching.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.659
I'm not even sure that I ever should retire from teaching.

01:29.919 --> 01:36.389
At least so long as both my body and mind are sound enough to keep going and that there are still students who want to hear me.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.432
Because...

01:39.037 --> 01:44.122
I have a kind of religious sense of what the teaching of literature is.

01:44.803 --> 01:54.614
And it seems to me that after my generation, that there will still be some good people teaching, we're not really going to be replaced.

01:57.036 --> 02:00.640
Do you feel that there are any books at all that deserve oblivion?

02:03.383 --> 02:03.904
Oh, sure.

02:04.344 --> 02:08.048
I mean, there are canonical works.

02:08.770 --> 02:11.313
and they have very special and fascinating problems.

02:11.874 --> 02:18.962
Thus, my dear fellow, I would vote, and I'm in print of saying this, in an excited great fury among the partisans of Edgar Allan Poe.

02:20.104 --> 02:30.176
I have written about Poe in the New York Review of Books and in a modern critical edition of, you know, Modern Critical Views, where I had a long introduction on Poe.

02:31.658 --> 02:35.282
Edgar Allan Poe is an author, one cannot get out of the canon.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.765
He's an immensely popular writer.

02:38.335 --> 02:48.845
And I suppose partly because as a myth maker, he is indisputable, but he's an abominable writer, an absolutely abominable writer.

02:49.285 --> 02:53.689
There isn't a poem by him that isn't a disaster, even the very best of them.

02:54.530 --> 03:05.400
And the prose is, whether it's argumentative prose, critical prose, or narrative prose, is unbelievably bad.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.482
He's stylistically a monster.

03:08.744 --> 03:09.285
It's amazing.

03:09.445 --> 03:13.909
He's a terribly bad writer, but he is undeniably canonical.

03:13.929 --> 03:15.511
I mean, there aren't that many cases.

03:15.531 --> 03:16.712
That's amazing.

03:18.353 --> 03:27.762
One of my interests in books, but I will always buy books, 19th century books, early 20th century books, that comment upon literature of the time.

03:27.823 --> 03:31.566
I'm always interested in contemporary evaluations.

03:31.586 --> 03:38.633
I came across a book, which is, I think it's 1876 or something like that, maybe even a little later,

03:38.917 --> 03:40.300
Oh, it's much later than that.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.523
It's about 1888 or whatever.

03:41.663 --> 03:43.507
I'm looking for it now as we speak.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.414
And it's about great American writers.

03:47.136 --> 03:49.721
And nowhere do you see a mention of Melville.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.209
I mean, Melville was totally forgotten and abandoned.

03:53.229 --> 03:55.795
Melville was revived by Raymond Weaver.

03:56.467 --> 04:00.874
It must have been around 1920, though I may get the date a little bit.

04:00.894 --> 04:03.639
I mean, they discovered that the stuff.

04:03.699 --> 04:10.910
But it was Raymond Weaver in a book called Herman Melville, Mystic and Mariner, who revived Melville.

04:11.992 --> 04:13.615
Perhaps it was earlier than 1920.

04:14.055 --> 04:15.117
I may have the date wrong.

04:16.179 --> 04:20.546
No, I think it is because they discovered Billy Budd about 1922 in those papers there.

04:20.646 --> 04:21.968
Yeah, that's quite true.

04:22.252 --> 04:43.405
But, you know, it fascinates me that my secret favorite among all 20th century American poets, or indeed poets anywhere, Hart Crane, from the time he was terribly young, and he was born in 1899, and his first poems are about 1918 or 1919.

04:43.905 --> 04:49.474
Of course, he dies of us at the age of 32 when he committed suicide in 1932.

04:49.977 --> 04:53.727
But Crane is obsessed with Melville from the beginning.

04:54.922 --> 05:06.279
I've often thought about trying to write an essay just as a comparative thing, if only because I have all of her works, because I love the lithographs of Childe Hassam, is Celia Faxter.

05:06.980 --> 05:21.222
Now there's a woman who was so popular in her lifetime, and she's a contemporary of Emily Dickinson's, and they were both corresponding with the same editors, and Dickinson couldn't get a damn poem published in the magazine.

05:21.603 --> 05:23.005
They thought she was nuts.

05:22.985 --> 05:30.353
Here's Thaxter, the darling, and she had the salon on the island off the coast of Maine, and she's an amusing woman.

05:30.393 --> 05:38.021
Well, the phenomenon of popular authors who become period pieces is a very fascinating one.

05:38.862 --> 05:45.870
And of course, a great many of the figures whom I've left out of that contemporary list of the canon

05:46.103 --> 05:50.495
are people who I'm convinced are just going to be period pieces.

05:50.515 --> 05:53.162
How do you feel about, you know, I love the Library of America.

05:53.183 --> 05:55.790
I love the whole concept of it, and I love the books.

05:56.752 --> 06:01.345
It was founded by and is run by my closest friend, Richard Fourier.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.049
How do you feel about this?

06:04.610 --> 06:07.614
I mean, because that is the selection.

06:07.674 --> 06:16.526
You do decide what works belong in the American canon here, and I guess by extension you decide which ones don't.

06:16.606 --> 06:23.976
I myself, though, I'm allowed to make suggestions since I'm one of their advisors.

06:25.258 --> 06:26.720
That was a generic you, by the way.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.424
How does one feel about it?

06:29.904 --> 06:30.505
Well...

06:31.345 --> 06:39.065
I mean, there are clearly a few authors there who are there, you know, for cultural reasons, let us say.

06:39.846 --> 06:45.220
And there are many authors who are there for historical reasons, General Grant, General Sherman, and so on and so forth.

06:46.837 --> 06:47.618
That's wonderful.

06:47.798 --> 06:51.682
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.344
You're being very generous with it as we're going.

06:54.364 --> 07:03.674
But I do love your statement that if you have to pick books, I mean, you take a complete Shakespeare and a Bible, and then after that it gets tricky.

07:04.314 --> 07:06.396
It does get very tricky indeed.

07:06.417 --> 07:12.863
Somebody asked me the other day, I don't think it was a journalist, just a friend, said, Harold, what would you really take as a third book?

07:12.883 --> 07:13.684
And I rooted about it.

07:13.704 --> 07:15.966
I said, well, certainly Shakespeare, if I can only have one.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.509
And certainly a King James Bible, if I could only have two.

07:20.471 --> 07:21.954
But boy, the third would be hard.

07:23.136 --> 07:23.898
Be very hard.

07:23.998 --> 07:27.645
I guess, probably in the end, I would take Cervantes.

07:29.007 --> 07:34.358
I would take Don Quixote, because it would be very hard to do without a copy of it.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.421
I'm not quite sure.

07:38.145 --> 07:39.928
Well, you'd take Cervantes over Dante.

07:42.642 --> 07:44.445
Sorry to put you in the spot here.

07:44.966 --> 07:58.650
I wouldn't claim, I really do feel that Shakespeare's only possible rival, and he doesn't quite match Shakespeare, even Joyce admitted that in Western literature since the ancient world, is Dante.

08:02.216 --> 08:02.777
Dante.

08:05.727 --> 08:07.851
You're agonizing over this, I can see it.

08:07.871 --> 08:11.036
What a great, harsh poem.

08:11.236 --> 08:13.700
It scares the life out of me.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.802
It fascinates me.

08:15.082 --> 08:17.927
I intend to go on reading it until I die.

08:17.947 --> 08:21.453
I intend to go on learning from it until I die.

08:21.854 --> 08:22.515
I don't love it.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.960
I don't love it the way I love Cervantes.

08:26.942 --> 08:28.765
It fascinates me endlessly.

08:30.854 --> 08:36.644
I just got a review copy of a book from Yale, as a matter of fact, on Tyndale.

08:36.764 --> 08:41.373
Have you seen that on the Tyndale Bible?

08:41.393 --> 08:41.893
No, no.

08:42.094 --> 08:50.128
I have the Yale editions of the Tyndale Old Testament and New Testament.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.294
And I knew that there was a new study.

08:53.434 --> 08:54.255
It looks wonderful.

08:54.295 --> 08:55.898
It just came in a couple days ago.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.100
Who is the author?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.843
Daniel, D-A-N-I-E-L-L.

08:59.303 --> 09:00.545
He is the fellow who edits.

09:00.566 --> 09:02.969
That's correct, yeah.

09:03.150 --> 09:15.610
And it's a Yale book, and I just got a review copy of it, and I was so impressed I got it in my bibliography because it is an interesting, you know, this is a book that was fatal to its author.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.631
And there's a wonderful book, which I have right here, as a matter of fact.

09:19.671 --> 09:20.673
It's an English book.

09:21.655 --> 09:26.684
And the title of it is Books Fatal to Their Authors by P.H.

09:26.804 --> 09:27.445
Ditchfield.

09:27.485 --> 09:28.407
Have you ever heard of this book?

09:29.429 --> 09:29.489
No.

09:29.509 --> 09:31.152
And it's...

09:31.756 --> 09:33.118
This is one of these.

09:33.959 --> 09:40.790
My bibliography is very interesting, by the way, because it's largely made up of books that I acquired in the hundreds just to do this research.

09:41.531 --> 09:44.916
I will insist upon Glenn giving me a copy of your book the minute it's out.

09:44.936 --> 09:48.000
Well, I will insist upon that, and I'll make sure you get one.

09:49.342 --> 09:51.185
Professor, I'm not going to take up any more of your time.

09:51.205 --> 09:52.447
You've been very generous with it.

09:52.567 --> 09:59.097
As a special favor, this all interests me very much, and when your column is done,

09:59.566 --> 10:02.271
When it appears, wherever, could you send me a copy of it?

10:02.451 --> 10:04.114
If you give me your address, I'd be pleased.

10:04.134 --> 10:17.558
My best mailing address, and I'd like to stay in touch anyway, is 179 Linden, L-I-N-D-E-N, 179 Linden Street, New Haven, Connecticut.

10:17.926 --> 10:18.588
06511.

10:18.729 --> 10:20.976
06511.

10:22.159 --> 10:22.962
I've got it.

10:24.085 --> 10:24.747
This will be soon.

10:24.808 --> 10:26.192
This will be within the next two weeks.

10:26.473 --> 10:28.138
Good fortune to you, sir.

10:28.419 --> 10:28.880
Thank you, sir.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.783
It's been a great pleasure.

10:30.245 --> 10:31.007
Take care.
