00:04.469 --> 00:08.774
You are responsible for moving all of the books.

00:10.316 --> 00:13.380
Could you tell me when you will be starting to move?

00:14.441 --> 00:28.398
Not only moving the books, but rather the collections which are going to move, whatever the place where they are.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.885
It's not a question of moving.

00:34.709 --> 00:37.913
the printed and audiovisual materials.

00:39.856 --> 00:46.405
Could you give us an idea of the numbers, how many volumes you will be moving?

00:46.805 --> 00:57.279
About ten millions of volumes for the books and one million of documents for the audiovisual materials.

00:57.299 --> 00:59.923
And how long do you think that will take to

01:00.595 --> 01:05.280
It is organized in two different phases.

01:05.300 --> 01:19.396
One started in February, is going to finish at the end of this month, for the collections which were outside of Paris.

01:19.416 --> 01:29.708
And the second phase, second part, will last nine months as a

01:30.042 --> 01:57.433
maximum and we don't know exactly when it's going to start because in this case the date of opening is important for the for the moving if we open in June the moving will start at this time

01:57.751 --> 02:03.157
if we open in... We were just doing some mathematics.

02:04.138 --> 02:11.426
If you're going to move nine million books in nine months, that's a million books a month, approximately?

02:12.026 --> 02:12.727
No, it's not that.

02:13.949 --> 02:26.442
It's ten million of books, volumes, in totality, and we already have done a part of the... Yes.

02:26.759 --> 02:37.109
And as I told you, the books are moving in two different parts.

02:37.650 --> 02:55.787
One, the first part, it is for the collections which were housed outside of Paris, because we had already an annex in Versailles and in Sablé, too.

02:56.122 --> 03:03.292
in a small town located at 200 kilometers from Paris.

03:05.135 --> 03:19.214
So it means that we have moved 60 kilometers and we will have to move more than 100 kilometers.

03:20.556 --> 03:25.403
And, you know, two different places, two different collections.

03:25.467 --> 03:30.471
and all of them are ten millions of volumes.

03:30.491 --> 03:34.255
Are you moving them according to where they're going to be shelved?

03:34.395 --> 03:37.498
Like, are you starting in the upper floors first and coming down?

03:37.578 --> 03:39.359
Is that how you're doing it?

03:39.419 --> 03:39.760
Yes.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.641
It is not the order.

03:43.082 --> 03:53.972
We choose to move them in relation where their future location and in relation with their

03:54.897 --> 03:58.842
the way they are provided to the readers.

03:59.102 --> 04:10.037
I mean, if they are frequently provided to the readers, they will move around the opening.

04:10.677 --> 04:22.052
If they are not... What you say raises an interesting point.

04:22.673 --> 04:29.722
You're choosing to put books that are in greatest demand by readers closer to the reading area.

04:29.742 --> 04:32.926
Yes, but not book by book.

04:33.147 --> 04:44.221
You know, the books here are organized in different, we call it in French, series.

04:44.241 --> 04:49.288
Like, you know, we have a letter for, for instance, we have a letter

04:49.792 --> 05:07.550
the letter G, which means general history, and so all books about general history are called G something, G1, G2, G2000, G3000.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.252
Does that go along with the encyclopedic?

05:10.754 --> 05:18.702
No, it's alphabetical order for division of knowledge, which

05:19.508 --> 05:23.052
has been chosen in the seventeenth century.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.876
It is proper to our library.

05:26.977 --> 05:29.159
It's what we call classification.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.446
You know, it's a classification for the Bibliotheque Nationale.

05:35.787 --> 05:47.440
Because a number of your colleagues yesterday were telling us about the philosophy that you have, the encyclopedic intent of what you're creating, I guess, is an encyclopedic library?

05:47.757 --> 05:52.062
This is the word that we found, we saw used many times yesterday.

05:52.323 --> 05:52.563
Yes.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.226
But I found that doesn't apply in terms of the classification.

05:55.427 --> 05:59.632
You're talking about the shelving, actually, not the collecting aspect.

05:59.652 --> 06:12.448
Yes, it's about, it is encyclopedic, but our encyclopedic collection has been organized in different subjects.

06:12.901 --> 06:18.387
And this choice of subjects has been done in the 17th century.

06:18.427 --> 06:26.477
So I mean, for instance, religion and philosophy and art have a great part in the organization.

06:27.939 --> 06:42.115
But what we call problems of society, you know, they don't have any room in this classification, you know, because

06:42.803 --> 06:53.155
We have books, but we don't have the good letter for that, because it's alphabetical order, A, B, C, D, E, it's for religion.

06:53.456 --> 07:12.338
F is for law, G for general history, J for antique history, H for history of church, L for history of France,

07:12.622 --> 07:41.413
K for history of Italy, L for history of France, M for history of northern countries, N for England, O for America, Spain and Oceania, and R for philosophy, S for natural sciences, T for medicine, U for

07:42.102 --> 07:59.228
arts and mathematics, and X for grammar, Y for literature, and Z for all the subjects you don't have.

07:59.648 --> 08:01.851
So you're keeping the same classification?

08:01.932 --> 08:02.633
No.

08:03.073 --> 08:11.586
We are going to move this collection with

08:12.292 --> 08:13.653
this organization.

08:13.813 --> 08:15.115
With the new organization.

08:15.435 --> 08:17.597
Towards the new library.

08:17.677 --> 08:20.319
And we maintain the classification.

08:21.100 --> 08:28.987
But we decided to divide the different collections.

08:29.748 --> 08:30.529
In the new building.

08:30.549 --> 08:30.809
Yes.

08:31.249 --> 08:38.336
For instance, the religion is going to go in the department of philosophy, history, social sciences.

08:38.736 --> 08:39.497
History is going

08:40.085 --> 08:42.248
Religion, you said, I'm sorry?

08:42.328 --> 08:42.608
Yes.

08:42.668 --> 08:43.609
Religion, OK.

08:44.210 --> 08:57.487
And we don't divide the collections by book, but subject collection by subject collection.

08:57.507 --> 08:58.188
I see.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.010
I understand.

09:00.250 --> 09:06.458
And now we have stopped this classification.

09:06.478 --> 09:09.822
And in the new library,

09:10.865 --> 09:13.568
have started a new classification.

09:16.552 --> 09:19.956
Are you going to be on a card catalogue, or is it going to be online?

09:20.537 --> 09:20.978
Online.

09:21.318 --> 09:23.180
So no card catalogues?

09:23.260 --> 09:23.661
No.

09:24.983 --> 09:26.845
No, not at all.

09:26.865 --> 09:28.687
The card catalogue, will you keep that?

09:28.707 --> 09:29.769
Yes, we keep it.

09:30.249 --> 09:31.691
Do you keep it up to date to it?

09:31.711 --> 09:37.378
We keep it for the parts we have in both.

09:38.185 --> 09:42.090
possibilities online and cards.

09:42.110 --> 09:47.096
But if now we are not cataloging— We are not?

09:47.136 --> 09:48.278
That was my next question.

09:48.558 --> 09:50.320
So you're not adding any new items to it?

09:50.340 --> 09:50.400
No.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.883
So you're maintaining—so what's the cutoff point?

09:52.923 --> 09:57.749
How—where does the catalog—the card catalog cut off?

09:57.769 --> 09:58.270
What year?

09:58.290 --> 10:01.274
1988.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.640
And everything after that is totally online?

10:06.660 --> 10:06.841
Yeah.

10:07.502 --> 10:07.922
I see.

10:08.257 --> 10:09.499
Are you happy?

10:09.999 --> 10:12.142
Are you excited about the new building?

10:13.804 --> 10:24.056
Just not excited with things that is normal evolution.

10:24.296 --> 10:25.398
No problem.

10:25.418 --> 10:33.808
Not a problem, but it is the same thing as

10:36.235 --> 10:39.419
What we do now, we are calling.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.581
We are phoning.

10:41.242 --> 10:42.624
We use the phone.

10:42.964 --> 10:48.972
Before, our parents and grandparents used to write.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.494
We don't write more.

10:51.496 --> 10:58.064
And so, as librarians, we use online catalogs.

10:58.084 --> 10:58.605
That's all.

10:59.647 --> 11:04.173
It's just progress, is what you're saying.

11:04.193 --> 11:04.453
Yes.

11:05.092 --> 11:13.403
How about in terms of, I guess my question was more pointed on the organization of the new library.

11:13.443 --> 11:16.247
Are you happy with the way that the books are going to be?

11:16.267 --> 11:22.055
I mean, would you rather have had them maybe perhaps a lot closer together and organized?

11:22.155 --> 11:25.800
Do you think the towers are going to work out all right?

11:29.125 --> 11:32.770
I don't think anything about that, because, you know,

11:33.880 --> 11:54.079
this project was decided in 1988, or me, I decided not to complain about that.

11:54.780 --> 12:03.128
It represents for us progress, because we have

12:03.547 --> 12:10.614
space for collections, comfort for readers, and money for acquisitions.

12:10.774 --> 12:12.116
And so, what do you want?

12:15.119 --> 12:15.539
More?

12:16.180 --> 12:18.122
Yes.

12:18.422 --> 12:25.869
In French, I could say I have none in a .

12:25.889 --> 12:26.310
Excuse me?

12:26.330 --> 12:28.352
Complain.

12:28.412 --> 12:32.676
Lady, when are you moving up to Tobias?

12:33.112 --> 12:34.634
The collections, or me?

12:34.794 --> 12:35.976
You, you?

12:37.378 --> 12:39.881
I have already moved, because I have two offices.

12:39.901 --> 12:40.823
You have two offices.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.043
Yes.

12:41.103 --> 12:41.924
I have one.

12:42.265 --> 12:47.111
I went this morning in Tolbiac, and this afternoon here.

12:47.472 --> 12:47.812
I see.

12:47.832 --> 12:48.513
Thank you.

12:48.533 --> 12:52.659
Thank you, by the way, for seeing us here.

12:52.699 --> 13:00.570
Do you have a policy on ... I know that you're the legal deposit for everything published in France, but

13:01.208 --> 13:07.417
Do you have a policy on what we call the last book policy, which we see in England, for instance?

13:07.517 --> 13:15.668
Do deaccession things, I guess is what I'm asking, do deaccession books, books that aren't in demand?

13:16.730 --> 13:26.203
You were talking earlier about putting books probably higher in the towers that people very rarely ask to see.

13:27.179 --> 13:40.894
two parts, so the local deposit for all books published in France, that's an important part of the collections.

13:41.595 --> 13:51.846
We must store these collections and keep it for future generations.

13:52.026 --> 13:55.330
And secondly, we acquire a lot of

13:55.563 --> 14:09.819
books in major subjects, and we have now a policy about free access collections and what we call stacks collections, so we have two collections.

14:11.201 --> 14:23.595
And this free access collection is divided in two parts, one for what we call au jardin and another for pre-jardin.

14:24.301 --> 14:53.464
one for upper level or lower level or one for general public and one for researchers and so the part reserved to the stacks is less important than it was here in the Bibliothèque Nationale because we did not have at this time free access and we used to say that it's

14:54.170 --> 15:06.164
A third for free access upper level, a third for free access researchers, and a third for stacks.

15:07.025 --> 15:08.066
I see.

15:08.086 --> 15:22.843
And we acquire in all the subjects, and it's an important change because the old national library used to acquire only

15:23.313 --> 15:38.092
in humanities, I mean social sciences, and history, and literature, and classic languages.

15:38.392 --> 15:52.510
And now we open our collections to sciences and law, economics, and we buy in all those

15:53.047 --> 15:58.213
I guess maybe I didn't make it clear.

15:58.273 --> 16:22.362
Are there occasions where you'll have a book that's number one, what we call a brittle book, a book that's not in the best of condition, and also if that book is not being used, if scholars haven't asked for it in 20 years, is it possible, number one, that you might decide to deaccession, get rid of that book,

16:23.017 --> 16:34.354
Or, number two, make a digital copy of it, and for the sake of conserving space, consider that digital copy satisfactory and get rid of the physical copy.

16:34.454 --> 16:38.741
Is that something that you might consider doing, or is that not... It's a French book.

16:38.761 --> 16:44.630
We'll try to keep it, even if it is in a bad state.

16:45.711 --> 16:50.138
And we'll try to keep it, but we are going

16:50.843 --> 16:55.667
if it's the case, to microfilm it or to microfish.

16:56.608 --> 17:02.713
And so we'll keep both the original and the original.

17:02.994 --> 17:04.295
So you will keep the original?

17:04.395 --> 17:04.735
Yes.

17:05.055 --> 17:19.568
And it is, for instance, different with the New York Public Library because the New York Public is

17:20.223 --> 17:25.450
I know they don't keep the collections that are going to my crossing.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.572
Because actually they're a private library.

17:27.592 --> 17:30.195
People don't realize that it's not a public library.

17:30.376 --> 17:36.403
But what we think, for French collections, it's normal to do that.

17:36.503 --> 17:46.336
It's not quite normal to do it for foreign collections, because we have not the same mission about that.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.099
But you know, French people

17:50.041 --> 18:16.710
are, we say in French, conservateurs, and so they like to keep the things, you know, they are Latin, European, and so they want to keep things.

18:17.311 --> 18:18.512
The word we see

18:19.403 --> 18:21.986
often used is patrimony.

18:22.466 --> 18:22.847
Yeah.

18:22.867 --> 18:25.569
And I think this is kind of what you're saying to a degree.

18:25.589 --> 18:25.990
Yes.

18:27.712 --> 18:47.672
But they consider, as soon as the collection has been acquired by the library, the French people consider that the collection becomes patrimony.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.607
a part of the patrimony.

18:50.929 --> 18:55.676
And so they keep it for eternity.

18:56.757 --> 19:03.587
And in the public library, they don't have the same idea of that, you know.

19:04.268 --> 19:16.545
They put books for readers, and as soon as the readers don't need the collections,

19:16.913 --> 19:21.638
they get rid of them, you know.

19:21.678 --> 19:34.192
But we are what we call a national library, and it has formations to keep.

19:34.232 --> 19:41.200
Well, the new library, it seems, was built to make a statement about precisely what you're saying.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.883
Do you agree that a library is a symbol

19:44.369 --> 19:51.297
particularly the brand-new, is a symbol of French culture, French literature, French history.

19:53.799 --> 19:56.382
Is it a symbol, I guess, as much as a repository?

19:56.402 --> 19:56.843
Yes, it is.

19:56.863 --> 19:57.744
It is a symbol.

19:57.924 --> 20:13.701
It is a symbol because till 1988, this library was more appreciated by

20:15.402 --> 20:32.839
foreign people than by French people because it is considered by public as a place where you never can go into.

20:33.760 --> 20:43.870
And so it's difficult because it's a closed space.

20:44.671 --> 20:45.392
And so

20:46.132 --> 20:50.616
Tolbiac, it is one of its advantage.

20:51.397 --> 21:03.548
Tolbiac is a symbol outside of the art of Paris and outside of the history of the Bibliothèque Nationale.

21:03.588 --> 21:14.738
And so everybody thinks that it can go into the Bibliothèque Nationale and something new, something better than it

21:14.887 --> 21:44.100
existed before and as we had the campaign of press about the opening last December a lot of people knew the library and because of this press and particularly because of the polemics which

21:46.291 --> 22:01.110
existed in 1989 when the project was proposed and chosen by the President of the Republic.

22:02.031 --> 22:14.728
And all those things, people in France who did not know the library at once thought that they had a national library, and they knew now that

22:15.333 --> 22:31.459
We have a national library, and so Tolbyac helped the library to be known for, by a lot of people.

22:31.919 --> 22:37.709
So a source of pride even in your national, you think?

22:37.729 --> 22:39.231
Pride.

22:39.599 --> 22:45.646
as a source of national pride, do you think, for people to look and say, this is our history?

22:45.666 --> 22:58.340
And I believe in Europe, and particularly in France, we don't have us in the United States this feeling of pride, because in the United States it's very striking for us.

22:59.842 --> 23:05.708
Everybody can be proud of building of an institution of something here.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.560
People, they are not proud.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.366
It is not in their makeup.

23:12.386 --> 23:13.548
No.

23:15.751 --> 23:21.199
Sometimes you can meet somebody who can tell you, I'm proud of that.

23:21.259 --> 23:22.701
But it's very rare.

23:22.781 --> 23:24.664
It's not our mentality.

23:25.305 --> 23:29.170
And it's a great difference between you and us, I'm sure.

23:30.151 --> 23:31.954
It's rare.

23:32.114 --> 23:36.100
Sometimes people told me that we are proud of this.

23:36.704 --> 23:42.850
But some people, it's not all the people as you are.

23:44.572 --> 23:56.824
I was very surprised to see on a bus, we are proud of America.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.147
We don't say that.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.068
We don't think that.

24:00.128 --> 24:05.513
And you never will see that in France.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.514
It's a question of mentality.

24:09.015 --> 24:14.462
They can appreciate it, but, you know, French people could be proud.

24:14.562 --> 24:17.165
You know, Paris is a wonderful city.

24:17.185 --> 24:20.069
We have wonderful museums.

24:20.790 --> 24:21.971
It's beautiful.

24:22.071 --> 24:22.372
Yeah.

24:23.733 --> 24:26.877
Louvre, museum, Picasso, Musée d'Orsay.

24:28.660 --> 24:31.463
We had the Cité de la Villette.

24:31.643 --> 24:34.487
We had a lot of recent museums.

24:34.973 --> 25:04.592
not recent institutions all institutions entirely renovated and did you hear some friends tell you I'm proud of that it's normal they consider it as normal they don't because they are a very old nation and because they have the feeling

25:04.977 --> 25:07.059
It's normal.

25:07.079 --> 25:11.263
We pay taxes and everything is normal.

25:11.303 --> 25:18.510
They can't realize when American people are visiting our buildings, they say, it's public money?

25:18.950 --> 25:24.075
It is the state which entirely built your library?

25:24.956 --> 25:27.658
Yes, of course, it's not possible.

25:27.799 --> 25:34.545
And in France, they can't realize that all your museums have been built because

25:34.728 --> 25:37.052
of private contributions.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.857
There are some exceptions to that.

25:39.897 --> 25:49.033
The Library of Congress, of course, is built by public funds, but that's one example, I think, where public money has gone into.

25:49.073 --> 25:58.609
But all the other libraries, you're quite right, are not supported by tax money, so to speak.

25:59.045 --> 26:09.901
My sense, though, with all these wonderful memorials, and we have the sense of French patrimony, and Monday is Bastille Day, and you're going to see so much pride and national honor.

26:09.921 --> 26:11.403
No, no.

26:14.307 --> 26:27.567
They are rather proud of their patrimony, but not in the meaning of the institution, but in patrimony.

26:27.985 --> 26:41.419
Yes, the paintings of Manet, they are ours, the manuscripts, they are ours.

26:41.439 --> 26:53.993
But it's not the pride for the institution, it's the pride for the collection, for the heritage, for the previous centuries, but not for

26:54.395 --> 26:55.437
the institution.

26:55.938 --> 26:57.641
Perhaps I'm mistaking that.

26:57.661 --> 27:02.690
Well, but I think what you're saying is absolutely correct, but maybe the building is a symbol for this.

27:03.972 --> 27:05.415
Yes, yes.

27:05.435 --> 27:07.559
A symbol for this great private house.

27:07.639 --> 27:18.478
But it cost, it cost so, so much money, and, you know, so... The English, like the English?

27:18.965 --> 27:21.388
The British Library, for instance.

27:21.408 --> 27:23.851
You did yours very quickly compared to the British.

27:23.871 --> 27:24.211
Yes.

27:24.231 --> 27:25.493
The English.

27:25.513 --> 27:46.558
Yes, but it's, you know, it's what we call in France a grand travaux, and yes, it was built very, very quickly, and it's

27:47.703 --> 27:57.974
People could be proud of that, not only as a library, but as a building.

27:59.276 --> 28:00.998
As a public works project, even.

28:01.018 --> 28:02.299
Yes.

28:02.319 --> 28:12.310
But, you know, at this time in France there are a lot of people

28:12.914 --> 28:24.972
unemployed people, and so on, and so the climate is not good climate, and so just people think this building costs a lot.

28:26.534 --> 28:36.088
They are not absolutely sure that we need it, you know, because it's another difference with you.

28:36.308 --> 28:39.573
It is our idea of libraries.

28:40.214 --> 28:41.115
People here

28:41.416 --> 28:48.265
think that they can be a student without going into a lab.

28:49.948 --> 28:54.194
It's not necessary if they need three books, you can buy them.

28:54.995 --> 29:09.735
And never the teachers, professors in universities say, you have to make this exercise, and bibliographical exercise,

29:10.137 --> 29:12.661
You must go into the libraries.

29:12.681 --> 29:15.946
It is more in your mentality than in ours, you know.

29:16.767 --> 29:37.357
When I was in the United States, I was very surprised, because I visited university, and I looked at the facts of the libraries, and what I saw, it was, university, our library, one million documents.

29:37.377 --> 29:38.659
It's the first thing you see.

29:38.960 --> 29:43.405
In France, you can look at the paper about the university.

29:46.108 --> 29:49.151
Of course, it's new to us, relatively speaking.

29:49.552 --> 29:53.396
The first public library in America wasn't even established until 1852.

29:53.697 --> 29:58.902
You have a much richer tradition here, maybe.

29:59.163 --> 30:01.605
Yes, but Latin tradition.

30:02.186 --> 30:05.290
The Latin buy their books.

30:05.310 --> 30:07.532
They don't go to libraries.

30:07.934 --> 30:09.075
Do you think that will change in the future?

30:09.716 --> 30:14.582
It is going to, it is changing, but it's a long way to change.

30:16.504 --> 30:17.365
It is changing.

30:18.366 --> 30:33.664
I've never been in a library during my studies, till I chose to be a librarian.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.928
You were not in the library?

30:37.330 --> 30:51.046
When, you know, in your country, the children go into libraries very young.

30:51.346 --> 30:57.533
No, I have not been in libraries.

30:57.653 --> 31:04.321
Philippe Belaval, the Director General, told in a speech recently, I've never been in a library during my studies.

31:04.561 --> 31:05.262
Who said this?

31:05.731 --> 31:07.333
Director General here.

31:07.353 --> 31:07.834
Of here?

31:08.034 --> 31:22.993
I can't say that because I chose to be a librarian, so I started to go in libraries when I was 16 years old.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.395
Do you have public libraries?

31:24.736 --> 31:30.924
Yes, much more now than when I was young, but we have now.

31:31.505 --> 31:34.168
It is changing, but you know,

31:34.452 --> 31:39.280
The mentality can't change in ten years.

31:39.400 --> 31:46.531
It takes... What was the context when the director general said, what was the context that he had never been in a library?

31:46.852 --> 31:48.354
He certainly couldn't have been proud of that.

31:48.394 --> 31:51.339
Was he proud of that, that he'd never been and he's the director general?

31:51.359 --> 31:51.679
No, no, no.

31:51.800 --> 32:01.455
It was in an internal meeting about the way we must

32:04.709 --> 32:32.488
communicate about our library because people said in this meeting we have missed our communication and we did not, we have not succeeded to make this new library with its upper level different.

32:32.941 --> 32:48.824
We did not succeed to make it publicized, I think.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.288
Yes, available for people.

32:51.808 --> 33:00.501
And he said, yes, it's difficult to give this information because people don't use libraries.

33:01.038 --> 33:05.162
He said, I've never been in the library.

33:05.502 --> 33:06.664
That's amazing.

33:06.724 --> 33:10.608
In our country, we brought up to bring, my mother brought me, I brought my daughter.

33:11.729 --> 33:13.310
But we don't do that anymore.

33:13.330 --> 33:23.200
A big day when you're young, and we have two daughters, and my wife took the girls to the library, and they get their card, they get a library card, and they can go and take out books.

33:23.841 --> 33:26.764
My children never go into libraries.

33:26.784 --> 33:28.125
It must be very different.

33:28.565 --> 33:30.167
So the people here were very,

33:30.721 --> 33:37.448
they can understand, if they don't study at the library, why do they need the money going to a national library?

33:38.790 --> 33:39.090
Yes.

33:39.150 --> 33:43.495
So it must be mostly foreign people that come in and use the library?

33:43.535 --> 33:46.097
Yes, but, um, or scholars.

33:46.798 --> 33:54.586
Yes, scholars, French scholars, of course, but I don't speak about those ones, but those.

33:54.687 --> 33:57.049
Excuse me, I forgot to tell something.

33:57.350 --> 33:59.652
I'm sorry, Connie, were you asking a question?

33:59.692 --> 34:01.794
No, just the cultural.

34:01.814 --> 34:01.915
Okay.

34:01.935 --> 34:08.541
The cultural matter, I guess, is something we really wanted to discuss, and I think you did address yourself to that.

34:10.964 --> 34:11.604
Where were we?

34:11.884 --> 34:14.687
It was very, very interesting what we were talking about.

34:15.368 --> 34:24.437
Yeah, I guess, if then the vast, the general, the majority of French people aren't all that

34:25.362 --> 34:32.128
enthusiastic about libraries, how is it, then, that your nation spent seven billion francs to build them?

34:32.148 --> 34:34.470
I mean, where did they get that kind of support to do that?

34:34.490 --> 34:37.873
Or was that mainly President Mitterrand?

34:37.893 --> 34:41.436
I mean, I guess he was the one who really wanted this library.

34:41.496 --> 34:46.240
How is it, then, that the nation allowed this to go forward?

34:47.121 --> 34:49.143
We can say it's the same for the museums.

34:49.183 --> 34:53.867
Before, the museums were not frequented by public.

34:54.083 --> 35:18.572
Gradually public visited museums, and so as Mr. Mitterrand had decided a lot of major works, he just, he could wonder what he had to do, and he, you know, one of

35:18.687 --> 35:45.910
his advisor told him why not a library and he said of course a library as he was fond of books he decided but i think it in his idea this time it was that the old library this one where you are it is a like a monument in where you can't enter and so

35:47.324 --> 36:02.904
I suppose he thought we should do a library open to the public and where the public can go.

36:03.845 --> 36:05.687
And he tried to do that.

36:05.828 --> 36:17.162
But what I am telling you, it is not that we have built a library for a public which is not interested in.

36:17.362 --> 36:46.288
but we have built a library in a context which is a difficult context because as the students don't use a lot of libraries the universities don't have a lot of libraries and so those

36:46.437 --> 37:02.562
who frequent the libraries, who use the libraries, don't find any room for them in the libraries because we have a lack of seats for the students.

37:03.443 --> 37:10.234
And so it is normal to have built a new library.

37:10.687 --> 37:18.719
Bibliothèque du Saint-Pompidou welcomes every day 10,000 people of people, and it's a lot.

37:18.839 --> 37:30.636
And so it means that we, there was a space for La Brèze.

37:30.896 --> 37:40.170
What I tell you, it is, if you compare with your country, it is less in our tradition.

37:40.876 --> 38:07.390
And it is less in our tradition to use the services of libraries, all because we don't use them when the children are young enough to start an education for that.

38:08.129 --> 38:23.866
Or because when you are students, there are so many students that you can't choose them.

38:23.946 --> 38:37.140
But Bobour was decided, was created in the 70s and opened in 1977.

38:37.728 --> 38:44.437
And, you know, two years after, there were more than 10,000 a day.

38:44.457 --> 38:46.400
Now, this is a public one.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.622
Yes, quite free.

38:47.642 --> 38:48.984
And this is part of the show?

38:49.384 --> 38:49.544
Yes.

38:49.564 --> 38:50.926
Public and free access.

38:50.966 --> 38:51.687
Ah, 10,000 a day.

38:52.228 --> 38:53.049
More than 10,000.

38:53.390 --> 39:04.545
Now, I don't know if this is a paradox or not, but my wife and I have been remarking, and it is amazing to us that the French have such a great respect for their tradition of writers.

39:04.829 --> 39:10.474
You see a statue to Molière, you see a street name for Balzac, you see a plaque for Stendhal.

39:11.055 --> 39:12.476
I mean, you're... And bookstores.

39:12.496 --> 39:13.997
And bookstores sell books.

39:14.017 --> 39:22.365
So you really do have, it seems to me, a great respect for your... I mean, Anatole France, we see across, that your writers are respected.

39:23.426 --> 39:23.866
That's true.

39:24.827 --> 39:27.409
And so, therefore, the people must be reading the books.

39:27.449 --> 39:31.193
They must be a very literate nation.

39:31.213 --> 39:32.794
It's not...

39:35.879 --> 40:05.633
because it's their patrimony and because Moliere and Lafontaine and all those authors are taught in the schools and so the children know them and they go to the theatre and they look

40:06.187 --> 40:07.969
at the television, and so on.

40:08.690 --> 40:30.117
But it's not perhaps a paradox, but if I take the example of Philippe Balaval, it doesn't mean he did not know all those authors, because he was a very brilliant student.

40:30.437 --> 40:35.063
And so, of course, he knew Molière, La Fontaine, and so on.

40:35.498 --> 40:45.291
And he read a lot, but... He didn't do it in the library or anything.

40:46.933 --> 40:49.937
So you mentioned your own children don't go to libraries.

40:49.957 --> 40:51.419
Where do they get books?

40:52.580 --> 40:53.241
They don't read.

40:53.642 --> 40:54.383
They don't read.

40:56.485 --> 40:57.086
It depends.

40:57.687 --> 41:03.835
But one of them, the youngest, who is still at school,

41:04.085 --> 41:08.471
He's not a reader.

41:08.932 --> 41:17.204
He goes into the library inside the school, small library.

41:17.504 --> 41:22.211
He uses it when really he needs it.

41:22.231 --> 41:33.147
And the second, he's a student in law and he uses the library only to lend, to borrow books.

41:34.122 --> 41:40.775
And the eldest was a reader, but I'm not sure she frequented a lot to the library.

41:42.799 --> 41:52.619
In their case, I can't say anything because as I spend my life in libraries, they don't want to do the same.

41:52.779 --> 41:55.084
Perhaps they are not an example.

41:56.077 --> 41:57.319
It doesn't necessarily go together.

41:57.339 --> 42:00.023
You can be well-read, but not necessarily being at the library.

42:00.043 --> 42:00.683
Of course, that's right.

42:00.764 --> 42:01.425
At the library.

42:01.445 --> 42:05.070
And for myself, I love to own the books that I read.

42:06.472 --> 42:09.957
Particularly for the small things, novels and so on.

42:09.977 --> 42:15.745
I couldn't imagine to read a book which is not mine.

42:16.085 --> 42:22.354
You know, for a small... You know, I get a book from the library because I can't find it anyplace else.

42:22.587 --> 42:25.893
And then once I get it, I have to have my own copy.

42:26.614 --> 42:29.860
How often have we gone out to buy books that I've just read out of the library?

42:30.201 --> 42:33.266
Because I really want to own this book and to have it.

42:34.007 --> 42:40.599
And maybe that's... But boy, there are so many bookstores in Paris, librairies, everywhere.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.302
Everywhere, people buying books.

42:42.943 --> 42:44.967
Yes, I think we are...

42:45.436 --> 42:47.259
Rather reading people?

42:47.820 --> 42:51.105
Oh, and look at the river Seine.

42:51.605 --> 42:54.009
They're still there.

42:54.189 --> 43:04.004
The book stalls are... I think really that French are proud of their culture.

43:04.485 --> 43:06.248
Oh, I think that goes without question.

43:08.571 --> 43:12.497
More of their culture than of their institutions.

43:12.858 --> 43:14.160
Perhaps I'm...

43:14.613 --> 43:19.659
I make a mistake about that.

43:21.341 --> 43:31.572
Because I repeat that, the National Library is an institution which was reserved to a part of the population.

43:32.473 --> 43:43.506
So how can you be proud of an institution that you are not able to use?

43:44.414 --> 44:13.577
And so, first when I started to work here 25 years ago, when I told my family, no, my close family, when I told people I'm working at the BN, people

44:14.063 --> 44:15.725
I do not know what it means.

44:17.887 --> 44:33.083
The first time I came here, five or six years ago, to see Madame de Lucie, Florence de Lucie, and I took the metro, and I was asking directions, police.

44:33.523 --> 44:36.226
Nobody knew where the Bibliothèque Nationale was.

44:36.586 --> 44:38.488
I showed the map, nobody knew where it was.

44:39.169 --> 44:43.193
In Washington, if you have a small guide,

44:43.426 --> 44:53.896
You look on a small guide, you have a picture of the main reading room of the Library of Congress.

44:53.916 --> 44:59.241
Here, you can consult all the guides on Paris, never you will find the library.

44:59.862 --> 45:06.108
It's not considered, till now, it was not considered as a monument.

45:06.168 --> 45:07.629
Well, you can't even go in and see it.

45:08.010 --> 45:08.170
No.

45:08.770 --> 45:08.991
Yes.

45:09.391 --> 45:12.454
We had to stand outside and look from the door.

45:12.721 --> 45:13.683
So, I mean, that's important.

45:13.703 --> 45:16.968
You don't let the public go in and see that reading room.

45:16.988 --> 45:19.753
Is there a parallel with the Library of Congress, though?

45:19.773 --> 45:23.319
Because most of the general population does not know what the Library of Congress does.

45:23.359 --> 45:25.223
No, the Library of Congress is totally open, though.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.166
I mean, you charge a reader's fee, right?

45:27.667 --> 45:32.375
You will be charging at Tobiak a fee of 20 francs a day, right, for readers.

45:33.357 --> 45:33.497
Mm-hmm.

45:34.051 --> 45:39.138
It's not a... But the Library of Congress doesn't charge you for it.

45:39.198 --> 45:42.402
But the average population does not benefit from the research.

45:42.502 --> 45:46.648
Well, the Library of Congress says, please try and get the book someplace else.

45:46.668 --> 45:49.232
If you can't find it someplace else, come here.

45:50.073 --> 45:57.282
You know, the Library of Congress really doesn't want everybody to come unless they can't be accommodated someplace else.

45:59.025 --> 46:02.910
You're talking about, you know, how La Fontaine...

46:03.262 --> 46:05.926
the great writers are taught in the schools.

46:06.587 --> 46:27.636
I don't know if you want to comment about this or if you're familiar, but in the United States we have a great debate going on now about the Western canon, the significance of the canonical writers, whether or not, you know, actually, the people actually question whether or not they should be reading Shakespeare or is he relevant anymore.

46:27.656 --> 46:29.879
You don't have that problem here in France, do you?

46:30.040 --> 46:30.400
I think

46:30.650 --> 46:35.535
Is there a debate over what books are relevant and should be read and which ones should not?

46:35.555 --> 46:41.400
Is that a problem, a concern that's going on in France, to your knowledge at all?

46:42.201 --> 46:43.862
Excuse me, I've not followed.

46:43.882 --> 46:48.787
Okay, the debate over which books are significant in the curriculum in the schools.

46:49.688 --> 47:00.538
We have certain factions, feminists, African-Americans, so they're saying we should read the black writers.

47:00.957 --> 47:05.204
Well, they're saying we should read women or Hispanic.

47:05.224 --> 47:14.398
Because we have so many diverse heritages in the United States, there is a debate over which books should be taught in the schools.

47:14.818 --> 47:16.220
That's not a problem here.

47:17.142 --> 47:17.823
I didn't think so.

47:18.023 --> 47:23.311
I thought because there is one definite cultural heritage here.

47:24.092 --> 47:28.399
And then just one final question, because I know you're very busy.

47:30.320 --> 47:34.144
That was the question I was going to add.

47:34.164 --> 47:35.826
Give me a second.

47:37.067 --> 47:57.930
With Europe, all the nations of Europe, moving towards a united Europe, economically, politically even, do you see, in the instance of France, the French library helping your country retain its cultural identity?

47:58.349 --> 48:02.975
with all of these other factors working to make kind of a common country.

48:02.995 --> 48:16.471
I mean, does a library help you retain your cultural identity while all of these other movements are going on, political, economic, a United Europe kind of a thing?

48:16.491 --> 48:22.018
Or do you think perhaps the French will retain its French identity regardless of what happens politically and economically?

48:22.179 --> 48:27.445
The library

48:27.863 --> 48:42.582
We can say on a side that it will maintain the French identity.

48:42.622 --> 48:57.060
As we keep the French legal deposit, it stays as a part

48:57.327 --> 49:16.592
the art of the collection, because every year we receive 50,000 periodicals and about 50,000 monographs, about the same.

49:18.495 --> 49:24.162
And it means that every year this collection

49:26.167 --> 49:35.739
and it's treated and kept and with good things and bad things as the legal deposits.

49:37.942 --> 49:41.026
And so it is the art of the collection.

49:41.807 --> 49:56.106
And what I think it is National Library, which is organized around this legal deposit, continues to

49:57.233 --> 49:59.336
maintain this identity.

49:59.997 --> 50:14.356
Another thing I'm sure about that is that French people are not quite, you can see it, are not quite comfortable with other languages.

50:14.456 --> 50:25.992
And so they are not like other people like East Europe or Dutch people or Scandinavian people.

50:26.343 --> 50:36.733
And so those people, you know, they are English speaking fluently, and French people are not.

50:37.714 --> 50:44.922
Even if the new generations do it better than the old ones.

50:46.303 --> 50:55.472
But, you know, we can notice that in Tolbiac, we bought a lot of books in

50:55.975 --> 51:09.916
English, German, Spanish, and... But people, writers, that it's too much, they would prefer to have more books in French.

51:10.577 --> 51:19.211
In the San Pompidou, every year they buy less and less foreign languages books.

51:19.231 --> 51:23.417
And so I think it's not so easy to...

51:25.675 --> 51:54.248
that everybody can think because you know our children or we can go two weeks or three weeks in England or in Germany but to understand really serious matters and to have a

51:54.565 --> 52:02.116
reflection, to have a long thought about the subject, a serious subject.

52:02.176 --> 52:03.077
It's not so, is it?

52:03.978 --> 52:17.738
And I think that the language will help French people to keep their identity.

52:17.938 --> 52:18.739
Excellent answer.

52:19.801 --> 52:20.001
Excellent.

52:20.482 --> 52:22.665
I hadn't thought of that, but it's absolutely...

52:22.915 --> 52:26.158
Nobody asked for me that before.

52:26.178 --> 52:28.440
You know, I make my own answer.

52:28.461 --> 52:32.464
No, but it makes perfect sense, of course.

52:32.505 --> 52:33.526
Why didn't we think of that?

52:33.606 --> 52:35.367
That absolutely makes sense.

52:35.387 --> 52:43.536
But you're buying fewer and fewer books in foreign languages, and really the books, like the Library of Congress buys in 120 languages.

52:44.096 --> 52:47.039
They have mandated that they're going to collect in everything.

52:47.840 --> 52:51.083
Now, the French library is really focused on French

52:52.143 --> 52:57.832
not only French history and culture, but the language in the French language.

52:57.852 --> 53:00.636
So that's very, very interesting.

53:00.656 --> 53:21.087
And so if we use English, you know, for studies, people can read in German, in Italian, in Spanish, in English, of course, but, you know, it will be only a part of the people, and you don't

53:21.404 --> 53:29.355
change the mentality with a part of the people, you change with all of them.

53:29.375 --> 53:46.298
So what you learn to us, it's not your language we learn it, but it's more, it's what you export, it's your television, your cinema,

53:46.700 --> 53:55.309
your fast foods, your way of living, your shoes, your jogging, you know.

53:55.529 --> 54:08.163
And the problem of identity is less the problem of identity of culture, that identity of way of living.

54:09.024 --> 54:14.850
And gradually we have, all of us,

54:15.843 --> 54:27.100
We have, all of us, a common way of living because we fly easily.

54:28.362 --> 54:34.351
People have more money than it wants.

54:35.172 --> 54:44.466
It's a paradox because the people travel, a part of the people

54:45.357 --> 54:47.219
money enough to go, you know.

54:48.181 --> 54:51.345
I like United States, and so we go to United States.

54:51.385 --> 54:58.033
But I meet people who are traveling for United States.

54:58.073 --> 55:02.739
I could not have imagined to meet the French people there.

55:03.681 --> 55:11.871
And so for me, United States, it's a question of

55:13.049 --> 55:41.065
culture than the way of living but people go there very easily as twenty years ago we used to going to Europe and so I'm not sure for Europe that people

55:42.698 --> 55:51.768
new generations are going to feel as Europeans because of all that.

55:51.789 --> 55:59.858
They will be French for their culture, and they will be cosmopolitan for their way of living.

56:00.599 --> 56:09.369
But both between... Very correct.

56:09.549 --> 56:11.271
Another quick question.

56:11.555 --> 56:13.737
What prompted you to become a librarian?

56:13.757 --> 56:16.679
Why did you decide to be a good librarian?

56:16.699 --> 56:23.165
Because of... It's a progression.

56:23.245 --> 56:37.697
Because I wanted to... First, I wanted to do something with history, because I was very... When I was a child, I was very keen of history and geography.

56:37.717 --> 56:40.920
It was the only thing which interested me.

56:41.913 --> 56:43.035
Geography and history.

56:43.055 --> 56:46.521
You know, in France, both are taught together.

56:46.902 --> 56:48.144
Geography and history.

56:48.164 --> 56:49.466
Geography and history.

56:49.887 --> 56:50.448
Yes.

56:50.468 --> 56:51.950
Interesting.

56:51.970 --> 57:04.191
And so I wanted to do something with both, and I thought that I should be a teacher of history.

57:05.723 --> 57:21.941
One day my father told me, there is an institution called École Nationale Deschartes, it's like in France we call Grande École, it's prestigious, more prestigious than university.

57:22.722 --> 57:26.927
And so I told him, I'll try to do that.

57:27.027 --> 57:35.376
And so I did that and when I was at, I passed,

57:35.963 --> 57:39.607
I integrated Ecole Nationale des Arts here in Paris.

57:41.189 --> 57:45.915
I could choose between archives and libraries.

57:47.056 --> 58:04.958
And as an historian, I should have chosen archives, but I chose libraries because

58:05.900 --> 58:25.613
When parallel in my studies I made history of art, you know, I liked pictures and art, and so I preferred to be a librarian and I

58:27.449 --> 58:54.705
wanted to work here in Bibliotheque Nationale in Department of Prints and Engravings and so I started I got the job and I started here 25 years ago in the Department of Prints and Engravings and I thought that my whole life professional life will be in this department and after I changed but

58:55.934 --> 58:59.198
I want to be sure if this is your correct title here?

59:01.101 --> 59:01.601
Yes.

59:02.082 --> 59:03.183
Do you have a card, by the way?

59:03.364 --> 59:04.285
Yes, I'm going to.

59:05.166 --> 59:17.582
I think that's... What was the name of the school, again, that you went to?

59:17.822 --> 59:21.587
Ecole Nationale des Chartres.

59:21.787 --> 59:22.628
Deschartes?

59:22.648 --> 59:24.030
Deschartes.

59:24.651 --> 59:27.434
C-H-A-R-T-E-S.

59:27.855 --> 59:29.357
Ah, I got it right.

59:29.377 --> 59:29.677
Thank you.

59:29.697 --> 59:31.599
It's one for Tolbiac and one for Richelieu.

59:31.780 --> 59:32.461
Oh, very good.

59:32.501 --> 59:33.041
Two cards.

59:34.643 --> 59:39.550
Because two offices and I could have one with two addresses.

59:39.570 --> 59:40.411
Thank you.

59:40.431 --> 59:41.472
Thank you.

59:41.492 --> 59:44.215
I think that we thank you very much for your time.

59:44.356 --> 59:45.177
For a lot of time.

59:45.197 --> 59:46.258
For a lot of time.
