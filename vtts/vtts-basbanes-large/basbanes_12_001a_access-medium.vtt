00:03.507 --> 00:19.166
There are hundreds of books in this library, and we asked Professor Jackson here to help us understand the context of the book.

00:19.186 --> 00:28.017
So I'm pleased to introduce Professor Jackson.

00:28.037 --> 00:31.641
Okay, first of all, did everyone get the hand?

00:31.981 --> 00:32.502
There is a door.

00:32.684 --> 00:37.473
that they all break them down.

00:39.476 --> 00:49.174
And I'd like to thank the Boston Library Institute and Laura Mark for the opportunity to speak to us for more than an opportunity to take the pressure of Martin Luther King and John Adams.

00:49.762 --> 01:03.990
I have lost sight of the irony of talking them up under the auspices of an institution that has officially disproved

01:04.122 --> 01:20.168
I look forward to sharing the preliminary results of my investigation, indeed in sharing the experience of discovery, for the investigation did not look quite as I had expected it to.

01:20.208 --> 01:24.595
I knew that Adams would be good, but I didn't quite know which he would be good.

01:25.418 --> 01:39.621
There will be time for questions at the end, but when I'm in the position that you're in at the moment, I often find no questions arise from the speaker and by the time the speaker is through our philosophy.

01:40.662 --> 01:48.675
So I'm going to stop every 10 minutes or thereabouts just to see if your questions are on the bit that I just finished.

01:49.195 --> 01:55.442
So we can consider that time tick-lock with question time at the end, if need be.

01:57.616 --> 02:05.830
It is not that Adams' activity as an annotator was overlooked or hushed up till now, on the contrary.

02:06.671 --> 02:20.434
As many of you know, Adams himself intended that his extensive library should be kept intact and continue in use, and although his original plan for it did not work out, later provisions for the collection respected his intent.

02:20.988 --> 02:33.226
The collection has been properly catalogued and cared for according to the standards of the day, which means that over time it has to be recatalogued and rehoused, and it is even now being recatalogued with you.

02:34.448 --> 02:37.452
It has attracted an unusual amount of quality attention.

02:38.714 --> 02:40.937
John Adams loved his book.

02:41.440 --> 02:56.715
Recognizing that fact, my author of historians have frequently turned to his biography for evidence about the course of his ideas, and to the annotated books particularly for clarification of his views and opinions on political issues.

02:56.982 --> 03:16.898
The Marginaliole was particularly well-offord by Jotan Harashki, the curator of the collection of the Boston Public for many years, who first of all wrote a serious article that presented Adams' notes on the first title, and then in 1952 published his book, John Adams and the Prophet's Progress.

03:17.502 --> 03:35.859
With apologies to those of you who are already familiar with Adams' library, and I'm sure there are many of you here, I'm going to begin by offering microscopic samples from the thousands of pithy content notes that Adams wrote in it was.

03:35.879 --> 03:38.762
I have selected how it doesn't almost take random, you will find it on the handout.

03:40.704 --> 03:45.028
For convenience sake, all are quoted from Hiraschi's book.

03:45.498 --> 03:59.363
On the other side of the hand are the zeroes of the pages, or photo, zero-color gems, the pages that include the last two notes, this image being likewise available in a published source, Joseph Ellis' Passionate Stage.

04:00.384 --> 04:06.375
After I had sent in the title of this talk, I discovered that Ellis had anticipated me, and now as well,

04:06.659 --> 04:11.665
He described Adams as typically opposition throughout his life.

04:11.685 --> 04:21.957
A man who instinctively mobilized his mental resources, quote, in opposition to established conventions, personal enemy, or fashionable ideas.

04:22.797 --> 04:30.286
He was only comfortable with dialogue and he was inviterate with the dialogue to perform an argument.

04:30.306 --> 04:32.869
The first number, I'm just going to walk you through the handout.

04:33.001 --> 04:41.489
The first thing occurred in the novel was copy of an essay by the early 18th century English deist Henry Simmons, Laura Bollinger.

04:43.170 --> 04:50.076
Bollinger, who had formerly learned about an earlier generation, Ralph Kudmer and his famous defense of the Christian faith.

04:51.358 --> 04:58.784
In the opening pages of his essay, Bollinger lethally exposed a serious flaw in Kudmer's argument.

04:58.824 --> 05:01.827
His words are absurd and impertinent vanity.

05:02.313 --> 05:09.284
mainly that words have assumed that divine and human intelligence were the same in kind.

05:09.304 --> 05:24.507
Relishing the controversy that was skeptical about both parties, Adams was quick to notice that after a digression of vanity, Bollingbroke carelessly made the same mistakes himself when he set out his own proof of the existence of both triumphantly declaring that

05:24.773 --> 05:39.289
Since there must have been something from eternity because there is something now, the eternal being must be an intelligent being because there is intelligence now.

05:39.930 --> 05:44.014
The divine intelligence is here argued from human intelligence.

05:44.034 --> 05:45.075
Are they of the state counted?

05:45.856 --> 05:49.440
Or has the floor made the same loader with colors?

05:49.540 --> 05:53.785
The eternal intelligence is internally different from the degree of man who lived from earth.

05:54.085 --> 05:57.717
but we can conceive of them such as us.

05:58.658 --> 06:08.611
While I catch his bottom work out in inconsistency, this true remark also shows that Adams was reading closely his character.

06:08.691 --> 06:15.480
Payment broke a compliment of taking him seriously even though his position on religion was far from out of his own.

06:15.500 --> 06:22.630
And the bottom work's social status was a constant irritant, as you may see from the mock reverence toward my lord.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.455
From a previous repeated refrain, this had another

06:28.088 --> 06:34.134
Next comes a pair known from Rousseau's discourse on inequality.

06:34.314 --> 06:45.285
Rousseau was an even less congenial figure than Bollinger, for Adams considered Rousseau to be A. preposterously vain, B. one of the primers of the French Revolution.

06:46.005 --> 06:51.050
This was not a singular opinion there or now.

06:51.070 --> 06:56.796
Adams' comfort of the discourse is hostile and often sarcastic in tone, but it is still not completely dismissed.

06:57.113 --> 07:03.841
I'm impressed by the effort that was manifestly made to be giving Rousseau his duty.

07:03.861 --> 07:16.457
Comparing the savage state of the state of civil addiction, for example, Rousseau laterally proposed that while the savage state was morally neutral, the civilized society did its more license and virtues.

07:17.939 --> 07:26.209
One years upon one years, that was your son, paradox upon paradox, what astonishing fugacity had Mr. Rousseau.

07:26.493 --> 07:33.970
Yet, the gentleman has with his affectation of singularity made then, discontented with superstition and tyranny.

07:35.674 --> 07:41.768
However, suspect his proposition then was so deserved credit for having disturbed the status, quote,

07:43.081 --> 08:00.187
But as Rousseau proceeds to develop this idea made maintaining that savages are not bad, precisely because they don't want what it is to be good, or it is neither the development of their understanding or the term of the law, but the calmness of their passions and their ignorance of life that prevents them from doing ill.

08:00.768 --> 08:02.190
How does simply laugh at it?

08:03.071 --> 08:06.276
Calmness of the passions of savages.

08:06.396 --> 08:09.561
Here I don't cry, I'll read this.

08:09.581 --> 08:10.202
Ha ha ha.

08:11.617 --> 08:19.729
His capacity for ridicule and abuse is still more apparent in response to a frivolous remark to Dalmer in a letter to Frederick Grace.

08:20.550 --> 08:25.777
Dalmer was just recycling his old joke, but it involved disrespect to the creator.

08:27.159 --> 08:27.860
And it is Dalmer.

08:28.441 --> 08:38.215
He also said concerning the confusion of the seers taught by ancient astrology that had he been present when God created the world, he could have given him so good advice.

08:38.330 --> 08:47.725
Now, I sometimes tend to believe that God was at least as much unique advice when he created mold as when he created physics.

08:47.745 --> 09:02.970
Adam said, Thou love, sleep, tick, ant, walk, or whatever vermin thou are, with this dupendous universe made it adjusted to give you money, sleep, or digestion.

09:03.423 --> 09:14.515
It's worth observing that even in an extreme case that would be the reason for the Nigerians not merely calling the author name, didn't just scribble idiots in the martyrs.

09:22.684 --> 09:31.573
The last two notes from Mary Wollstonecraft, historical moral view of the French Revolution, most densely annotated of all books in Adam's library.

09:32.397 --> 09:39.745
Here we see again that we have seen this whole disagreement outweighing approval, but outweighing disagreement in the efforts to be fair and accurate.

09:40.627 --> 09:44.010
This is probably true, as we'll say, in the margin of approval.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.572
Or, this is very exact.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.555
Or, there is wisdom there.

09:48.496 --> 09:49.637
Or, I wish this was true.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.563
Overall, he found a whole photograph.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.726
Too much of an idealist in our view of our family in this society.

09:57.746 --> 10:00.970
Therefore, it needed correction by a more experienced person.

10:01.253 --> 10:06.279
but there's no sense of balance for her views.

10:06.299 --> 10:12.426
Her book was published in 1794, before the revolution had run its force, before the Napoleonic War.

10:13.267 --> 10:20.916
She observed, for instance, that in the early years of the revolution, the press created divisions by ridiculing prominent things.

10:22.177 --> 10:26.923
It would have been easy for the assembly to have passed a decree to respect the lives, she remarked.

10:27.038 --> 10:37.454
It would become their passion for liberty that they were unable to discriminate between a licentious use of that important invention, the press, and its real utility.

10:38.576 --> 10:41.080
How it's demurred.

10:41.160 --> 10:51.797
If in any nation there is a single agreement between a license and a freedom of press, not the English, nor the American law certainly, not a government can do it and the people will not.

10:52.587 --> 10:56.793
On the other hand, he seems pleased to find their views coincide among the bank.

10:57.594 --> 11:08.729
Walt Stonecraft advises that, after the regular government, the plan of a new constitution ought to be immediately formed and present it to the citizens for their acceptance.

11:08.749 --> 11:11.613
And Adam's second.

11:11.693 --> 11:16.840
Now they preached this doctrine a whole year in Congress in 1775 and 1776,

11:17.208 --> 11:25.260
Before I could prevent the land, I passed my resolution of the 15th of May, 1776, recommending that message to the people of the state.

11:27.243 --> 11:30.888
So, here we have a few representative notes.

11:31.549 --> 11:32.710
Six of thousands.

11:33.852 --> 11:37.437
What do we see when we focus on this microscope?

11:38.980 --> 11:39.380
How?

11:39.400 --> 11:43.446
Modern readers are likely to be struck by the idiosyncrasies we have.

11:43.466 --> 11:46.911
The way it conveys the personality of honest John Adams.

11:47.887 --> 11:49.810
Most of us don't write a book.

11:50.671 --> 11:57.962
Even if we do, we do not write a book, because we read Hethi, Croningen, a great student of disease.

11:57.982 --> 12:01.988
I think that's fair to say.

12:02.008 --> 12:03.591
Even if we do, we don't write a book.

12:04.132 --> 12:09.760
Some scholars say we do not even read like a book anymore.

12:09.959 --> 12:16.146
Karen's development of the unattended reader was far from doubtful.

12:16.406 --> 12:38.329
Step-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step, point-by-step,

12:39.406 --> 12:48.297
Because Martin loves dramatizing the reading experience, we feel ourselves troubled when he laughs at Rousseau and rails down there.

12:48.317 --> 13:01.773
We are likely to admit to infer that Adam let himself go when he commuted alone with his wife, and that his undarted notes gave him away, revealing his essentially common presence.

13:03.235 --> 13:07.380
They confirm our image of exceptional mass.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.362
Adam is a fourth wall of exceptional mass.

13:09.460 --> 13:35.080
but he was also a man of his age and his behavior in all areas of life remained within the boundary of acceptance before that age if we look more closely at his practice of meditation and if we are able to see it from a historical perspective rather than in the context of our own assumptions and practices we may find we have to revise our image of him or our interpretation of the

13:35.870 --> 13:46.279
On the basis of a recent study of 2,000 books containing notes made by Adam's contemporaries, I can say something about common practices and special cases.

13:47.421 --> 13:55.748
They provide a context, reveal the options that were open to Adam when he sat down with a book hand in hand.

13:55.768 --> 14:04.476
I shall try to balance generalizations with particular examples, then I shall return to Adam's book and take a second look at the notes in the south.

14:05.350 --> 14:25.367
hey how are we doing does anyone have questions so far i just had one it's a matter of john adams was a public man by any definition and yet these were sort of described about when he wrote them

14:25.718 --> 14:54.578
have you any idea if you had any idea that somebody would later read them to leave them from posterity with the intention being read say by his son or grandson or in his family did everyone have a question um in the background you heard the question yes um you are very good question and i will come to it

14:57.511 --> 15:03.960
It's a rather meandering route.

15:04.120 --> 15:18.339
Customs related to book ownership and reading appear to have been stapled in the English-speaking world throughout the century until the first quarter or so of the 90s.

15:18.359 --> 15:24.868
Ownership conferred aesthetic privileges are affected by differences of class, sex, or nationality.

15:25.051 --> 15:37.504
So I make no apology to the fact that my survey consisted of British readers, but in a noun-ish spirit of fair play, I welcome opposing views and others.

15:37.524 --> 15:43.850
The first of these privileges was the right-to-right innumerable.

15:43.870 --> 15:51.278
Now, this is contemporary that it was routinely as a special occasion, so I'm going to start with one and proceed to the item.

15:52.928 --> 16:00.260
Several forms of routine use, which may have appeared to read a little time, but its duties persist to this day.

16:01.461 --> 16:06.790
They come as a general topic of study, collection management, and upgrading.

16:07.912 --> 16:19.510
For a book goes in a studious way, where the reader hopes to absorb some of the contents and expects to refer to the book again, but perhaps never again to read through the book.

16:20.165 --> 16:28.663
Several conventional strategies include underlining, headings, cross-references, and personal indexes.

16:28.903 --> 16:32.671
Underlining highlights significant passages so that they stand out on a second-regional gimmick.

16:33.813 --> 16:41.329
Heading, or head, identifies foreign topics and changes of topic page by page or section by section.

16:42.085 --> 16:50.193
Cross-references and margins are comparable patented in a single or in other books to which the owner has access, usually in the same collection.

16:51.435 --> 17:02.306
Personal index is commonly kept to the back of the book and commonly in page order, that is, this is a list of words that you write.

17:03.247 --> 17:08.312
Subjects are listed as a turnout in the course of reading and all sorted into alphabetical order.

17:08.545 --> 17:12.391
So these enable the reader to recover important passages later on.

17:13.814 --> 17:22.548
Senes had the interest of new economies, arguably more such as made myths of these kinds in the book itself, than on separate pages of a notebook for a context.

17:23.670 --> 17:34.468
Because, consulting a notebook would only lead you back to the book anyway, and before that you have to put the relevant notebook, whereas the synodal of the book itself is straight there.

17:35.849 --> 17:45.219
Friday the right book is not likely to become a problem until the collection reaches that critical time at which the brain of the collector loses track of what it is.

17:46.341 --> 17:51.186
But very few readers at Adam's time were in that position.

17:51.206 --> 17:54.590
I don't know what the maximum library to brain ratio is.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.413
There must be many variables.

17:58.314 --> 18:04.000
At the end of the lifetime of collecting afternoon over 3,000 volume was quite, I think quite a valuable number.

18:04.672 --> 18:10.958
Jackson had more than twice as many, but seemed not to have known his book so well.

18:10.978 --> 18:32.097
An interesting example of a studious reader, entirely normally misuseable, but unusual for the steal of his collection, was the London lawyer Francis Hartway, who was about six years younger than him, and whose heavily annotated collection law manuscript was purchased for the nation in 1813 at a cost of 8,000 pounds.

18:33.342 --> 18:42.977
When the husband comes to the beginning of purchase, the bookseller testified that marginal loans such as hard-rated might in 1813 increases.

18:43.177 --> 18:47.524
Increased the market value of the book many times, and this is what we say.

18:48.125 --> 18:54.514
Votes worth three innings, I have known, produced 200 under these circumstances.

18:54.534 --> 19:00.784
And books worth four or five shillings touching 40 pounds under the same circumstances.

19:02.148 --> 19:12.000
Harbrain's professional library is of special value because it displays the accumulating learning of the library.

19:12.020 --> 19:16.986
It allows the user to deploy the whole collection, and partly through regular upgrading.

19:18.087 --> 19:26.738
As new statutes were introduced in the UK that affected the interpretation of the law, Harbrain added notes about them to his books to keep them up to date.

19:27.157 --> 19:33.504
This was an oral practice for owners of many categories of the book, especially reference books.

19:33.704 --> 19:38.449
It was and remains an awful deficient process.

19:38.469 --> 19:47.439
Where a book proves to be inaccurate or deficient, the owner couldn't prove it and make up for its shortcomings by any corrections and adding new matters.

19:51.343 --> 19:55.307
Horace Walpole, who was pretty years out of this week, was writing to his book,

19:56.013 --> 20:01.079
names of the authors of the press would be their sort of discretion.

20:01.099 --> 20:01.660
So R.S.

20:02.220 --> 20:10.009
Walpole's copy with his identification, he is a recurrent theme of the catalog of the Walpole Library in Birmingham.

20:11.912 --> 20:23.185
These corrections and innovations would naturally be made in ink to last, as were Adams's and most of the eye margin in the of all time that I have seen from this period.

20:23.789 --> 20:31.517
the lawyer, held with some of his summative books in the spirit of what I call collection management.

20:31.537 --> 20:45.351
According to the cover of the book, its problems, its ownership, and notable features, such as Thorpe by the Midrash of Baths, many collectors still do this sort of thing, in spite of their athletic pressures to leave the gate at its feet.

20:46.292 --> 20:50.877
All these practices are so commonplace in the motor box, as we all have seen them.

20:53.776 --> 21:07.901
Public practices of the period, however, culminated as humans, with the result that a volume that with these features may seem to us more extraordinary than it really should.

21:07.921 --> 21:15.615
Because books were relatively scarce and highly valuable, because nobody could possibly own all the books he or she might have wanted,

21:15.815 --> 21:27.672
And because there were no public libraries in our instance of the term, since a library like this, large collections available to all without cost, books tended to circulate among groups of readers.

21:28.793 --> 21:37.445
Here, in turn, encouraged countless of laughs in later generations when books were cheaper and more accessible.

21:37.466 --> 21:42.092
When they finished the book, readers sometimes controlled by all the general ones.

21:42.224 --> 21:44.787
on the front or back slide.

21:45.608 --> 21:57.381
This is at a moment, to be able to thumbs up or thumbs down, but summarise the reader's opinion, forms of memorandum, who will stand as a guide on all the way to life.

21:57.401 --> 22:07.412
Montaigne, who had adopted this practice himself and recommended it in an essay on books, said even if it's to save itself trouble when you're reading.

22:07.432 --> 22:08.974
Even so you would do it for yourself.

22:09.427 --> 22:17.536
In the 18th century, the general note seems to have acquired the added purpose of being an introduction for other readings.

22:18.337 --> 22:25.425
So as it will circulate, it's circulated with a general endorsement or warning.

22:28.088 --> 22:35.115
How did this move all to look out?

22:35.195 --> 22:39.400
Well, one of the two, rather than the first note, is the general summing up.

22:39.633 --> 22:48.268
I especially like the one in the audience of inquiries concerning political justice, which I saw since I started this morning.

22:48.288 --> 22:57.084
This book exceeds and delivered intentional falsehood of what I have heard of chariotic, chariotic, chariotic, judgmental, and I can tell you enough to have it.

22:57.104 --> 22:58.707
It has become the universal library.

22:58.727 --> 23:00.090
It has become the universal library.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.472
It has become the universal library.

23:01.638 --> 23:03.040
The books studied long.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.323
It's the nearest problem of treason that I've made.

23:06.884 --> 23:13.250
Godwin has studied longer to see how much like the truth he could dress alive.

23:13.831 --> 23:26.785
And Toronto Adams' lifetime readers might also pick up their things to copy extracts or to do what they refer to as illustrating their books.

23:28.604 --> 23:58.223
extracting it understandable enough a book comes your way for a short time perhaps unknown for a circulating library often friend you want to keep a record of striking and potentially useful passages so you copied them out you might develop another book or a common case book to this purpose that was in fact adam's choice but other readers used the blank slides of books on similar subjects to store and

23:59.452 --> 24:18.516
It's not a bad planning system and we ourselves may be acting on these impulses when we drop relevant tippings or xeroxes into our books for safe keeping, receiveting, cookbooks, obituaries into works by the now-dead authors and so on.

24:18.536 --> 24:20.398
Extracting makes sense to me.

24:20.419 --> 24:27.147
The illustration I had probably for a long time, although it too was a widespread activity.

24:28.105 --> 24:40.118
I have conducted extensive research on the subject, and my hunch is that until about 1790, verbal illustration, not pictorial, was done in the book hall.

24:40.178 --> 24:47.806
And this usage, illustration by means of work, continues to lie about shifted to pictorial.

24:47.826 --> 24:54.113
That's all that old legal and historical works on their title pages describe themselves as illustrations.

24:54.363 --> 25:06.820
by parallel passages from comparable works, illustrated by parallel passages or by select remarks of the best commentators.

25:06.840 --> 25:18.075
With such models before them, readers concocted their own illustrated works, copying bits taken from other books to clarify or illuminate the text.

25:18.933 --> 25:30.352
But since they were not engaged in professional enterprises governed by the conventions of scholarship and subject to public scrutiny, these readers were free to make connections as they saw fit.

25:31.233 --> 25:35.220
In fact, they had a license to free associate and that is what some of them did.

25:36.263 --> 25:40.710
The links may well turn out to be backlink to an outside.

25:41.251 --> 25:43.735
You know, what is this doing in here?

25:44.897 --> 25:51.046
But they must be meaningful in some way to the person who made them.

25:51.066 --> 26:04.347
And to modern researchers, they offer valuable evidence not only of the contents of the reader's mind, which is what the reader thought in reading this passage, but also the way that mind worked.

26:05.744 --> 26:31.684
um although this practice i think is now practically extinct the biographer phyllisia hennon who died in 1835 did not have to explain what he meant when he wrote in 1836 that she used quote to illustrate her favorite books with the thoughts excited by their career and with such parallel passages from other writers of war on the stage

26:32.238 --> 26:42.650
He seems to have followed a kindness issue about, quote again, if one of her intimate friends lent her a book which she chanced to adopt, he was short-returned, thus enriched.

26:43.070 --> 26:58.988
The best example I know of his sort of working period is Hester Piozzi, Samuel Dawson's friend, again six years younger than Alice, who in the early 90th century made gifts to several friends,

26:59.491 --> 27:16.308
a volume that she had customized for them in this way, combining nuggets of information from others in her library with reminiscences, anecdotes, and jokes of her own, so that the recipients would have the impression of reading the book with her and in her way.

27:17.589 --> 27:28.620
I wish that I had time to illustrate this talk myself and a few of her fresh and funny observations, but you will just have to take my word from me that she is very good company.

27:30.237 --> 27:33.805
Now, we've already passed from everyday routine to special occasions.

27:34.907 --> 27:46.592
For many readers, the mindset we illustrate of reading one text to bear on another may have been a permanent part of the reading experience, but for most of them,

27:47.112 --> 27:51.318
The illustration was the exception rather than the rule.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.521
You choose the books that you graduate.

27:54.442 --> 28:00.391
Hester Piozzi did not give all her books for the illustration treatment, but made the effort now to get for the sake of friends.

28:01.172 --> 28:06.239
Even as Felicia Hemmings illustrated only select favorites among the books that came her way.

28:07.801 --> 28:13.149
So, questions on the... Yes?

28:13.249 --> 28:15.432
Are you data cross-references widely?

28:16.070 --> 28:17.892
Not very much.

28:17.972 --> 28:21.855
Actually, I'm not probably the best person to ask.

28:21.995 --> 28:23.857
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:23.877 --> 28:24.077
Right.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.179
Did Adam's cross-reference his library?

28:27.400 --> 28:29.362
Not so far as I can see very much.

28:29.963 --> 28:36.849
But you will really have to wait for the results of the work that Laura and her team are doing, to be sure.

28:37.330 --> 28:38.471
Not in one that I've seen.

28:41.373 --> 28:42.514
Thanks for the Warren.

28:42.735 --> 28:43.275
I'll carry on.

28:50.073 --> 28:56.101
Today we tend to assume that the deviant minority who write a book do it all the time because they can't talk.

28:57.924 --> 28:59.346
It's a habit.

28:59.366 --> 29:02.490
You know, habit is a bad word, it's by definition bad.

29:04.733 --> 29:11.342
My survey of romantic readers, rather from a surprise, suggests that for them the opposite was true.

29:11.883 --> 29:15.688
The majority of book owners wrote those books.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.751
But they did so only occasionally.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.299
for a particular reason.

29:20.201 --> 29:21.483
It is certainly true about us.

29:22.605 --> 29:34.365
While we justify being expressed by the annotated books, we have to remember that the only hundred volumes out of over 3,000 are recorded as containing real notes in his hand.

29:34.385 --> 29:40.836
In every case, I'd like to know what circumstances led him to choose that book and know another.

29:42.368 --> 29:50.080
We think that Adams loved his books and that he expressed his love, as some people do, by calling them.

29:50.100 --> 29:52.584
His behavior is entirely in keeping with standards of the time.

29:53.505 --> 29:59.955
Many readers of the 18th and 19th centuries testified to the pleasures of conversing with their books as well as women in companions.

30:03.108 --> 30:22.655
Erasmus, for example, teased a correspondent who thought that he was his best friend by referring affectionately to a group of intimate friends with whom he said, I either indulge in some delightful musings or else listen to their whisper, speaking to them as freely as to myself.

30:24.257 --> 30:27.141
Of course, the friend turned out to be his boss.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.066
But a ton of the writing in books was unremarkable behavior.

30:31.847 --> 30:39.340
Some readers left a record of these conversations, though I had yet to encounter any reader who did it indiscriminately.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.704
Coleridge is the best human of the type.

30:41.744 --> 30:49.378
In one book he memorably wrote, a book I value, I reason and fall with, as of myself, in my reason.

30:49.398 --> 30:52.403
But Coleridge is a person for morality.

30:52.805 --> 31:04.183
How about John Horne Took, a grammarian and gadfly, born just a year later than Adams, whose tone in marginale is the first match I have found to his.

31:05.245 --> 31:10.233
Like Adams, Took would scrutinize and offer his argument to point by point and take it apart.

31:11.134 --> 31:16.803
He could exercise his mind while reading and gradually formulate his own ideas on the subject of the days.

31:17.865 --> 31:19.808
Here, for example, is a single sentence

31:20.497 --> 31:28.490
from his friend Joseph's priestly dispositions relating to matter and spirit, who it took's interjections, so this is priestly.

31:29.973 --> 31:37.485
To a wholeness conclusion of which divine entertainer rebellion is not great.

31:37.506 --> 31:45.559
They refund from a former notion of spirit, making it in the strictness of the sense of the term and the immaterial thing without extension.

31:45.877 --> 31:51.764
consider these terms as seeing as they are not incompatible.

31:51.844 --> 31:55.689
Like Adams, Toad could be mocking and abusive.

31:55.769 --> 32:07.183
With his puppy on the French's own regular sheet of friends, he called them in the birth, idiots, and soft, and laughed at him, Marty, howl, howl, howl, howl.

32:07.203 --> 32:12.610
He rose as though he were addressing the author directly, challenging his assertions, talking back.

32:12.877 --> 32:18.184
So did other readers through all points of the social and political compass.

32:18.204 --> 32:33.403
Somebody named W. Davis Tinker, possibly a Methodist, can be traced through the marginalia fighting like a pit bull with a gentle Quaker offer to account with all religious persecution, religion and politics being natural topics of controversy.

32:34.524 --> 32:41.533
Just as the duke class can be seen expressing interest, approval, or disapproval of various passages in the world of Benjamin Franklin.

32:43.336 --> 32:50.446
These forms of readerly reaction are not unknown today, though they are less common and less acceptable than they used to be.

32:51.548 --> 33:02.543
One final example will introduce an unusual variant and expose a fundamental difference between the circumstances of readers in Adams' time and in others.

33:02.563 --> 33:09.372
Like Tooth, this reader, whom we see at work in several heavily outdated books, also sounds like Adams much of the time.

33:10.514 --> 33:12.617
In a copy of Bacon's essay,

33:13.103 --> 33:26.282
He retorts sharply, he who has few things to desire cannot have many things to fear.

33:28.365 --> 33:38.078
When Macon notes that kings past and present for doerphies in eunuchs, he says, because kings do it, is it wisdom?

33:38.098 --> 33:42.925
In Bishop Watson's Apology to the Bible, a refutation of pain made to reason, he declares,

33:43.208 --> 33:50.077
I have read this book with attention and find that the bishop has only hurt Payne's heel while Payne has broken his head.

33:50.998 --> 33:55.865
The bishop has now answered one of Payne's grand objections.

33:55.925 --> 34:08.923
To Sir Joshua Reynolds' assertion that where the representative arts are concerned, there is a rule obtained out of general nature to contradict which is to fall into deformity, he objects, what is general nature?

34:08.943 --> 34:10.284
Is there such a thing?

34:10.304 --> 34:12.287
Strictly speaking, all knowledge is particular.

34:14.005 --> 34:16.829
As in the case of Adam, is this reader's reason argument?

34:17.770 --> 34:18.552
Very, no.

34:19.393 --> 34:22.457
May he come to earth with unworth a strong feeling.

34:23.378 --> 34:24.420
Well, I'm quoting.

34:25.461 --> 34:28.326
Maybe you've already guessed who this is.

34:28.346 --> 34:30.228
Well, I think this will give it to you.

34:30.248 --> 34:32.852
The inquiry in England is not whether a man has talents and genius.

34:32.932 --> 34:36.958
He said about whether he is passive and polite in a virtue of that.

34:37.073 --> 34:39.817
and obedient to nobleman's opinions in arts and science.

34:40.457 --> 34:41.619
If he is, he is a good man.

34:42.220 --> 34:44.002
If not, he must be starved.

34:45.644 --> 34:50.270
So by now you probably fall onto the identity of this belligerent writer, he is William Blake.

34:51.992 --> 35:03.908
Blake's marginally are especially interesting because although they appear to be spontaneous expressions of annoyance, indignation, anger, contempt, etc., sometimes occasionally of warmth and grievous as well,

35:04.192 --> 35:15.608
The internal evidence revealed that all the inexpensively amateur notes were carefully prepared, with a clear personal articulation in the adherence to his song about him.

35:16.990 --> 35:25.742
Blake Martinelli also understood an alternative form of publication, one that he could control every step of the way.

35:26.523 --> 35:29.828
He did not have to play by the rules of public controversy,

35:30.044 --> 35:34.068
negotiate with publishers, or suffer the insults of reviewers.

35:34.828 --> 35:40.614
He put his case in the margins of his books, and he lent the books to like-minded friends.

35:42.916 --> 35:50.443
He defiantly put his name on the title pages alongside the names of the other authors.

35:50.583 --> 35:56.929
So, about Reynolds' titles, for instance, in an opposite of Francis P's portrait, he wrote this man.

36:00.908 --> 36:03.370
This is the opinion of Will Blake.

36:03.390 --> 36:08.975
The proof of this opinion are given in the following notes.

36:08.995 --> 36:14.921
Though he may be an extreme case, Blake was not alone in using marginalia in the 18th century.

36:16.102 --> 36:26.011
And his example brings home to us vital differences between that time and this, in terms of attitude towards books and marginalia.

36:26.031 --> 36:30.595
All readers of the period value books as durable objects.

36:33.005 --> 36:41.012
At some level of consciousness, they knew their books would outlive them.

36:42.654 --> 36:43.094
So they were.

36:43.114 --> 36:46.757
Furthermore, they took it for granted that other people would read them.

36:46.837 --> 36:51.101
Therefore, no marginality of this period can have been written in security and privacy.

36:52.142 --> 36:57.567
Or, to put it another way, all were written in anticipation of audience.

36:57.587 --> 37:00.970
Lake wrote in his copy of Lavender's Aphorisms on Man,

37:01.102 --> 37:15.034
I hope no one will call what I have written, cavalry, for I write from the warmth of my heart and cannot resist the impulse to rectify what I think wrong in a book I love so much and approve so generally.

37:15.054 --> 37:18.597
On the title page, he circled their two names.

37:18.617 --> 37:20.158
This is as close as I can come to the open.

37:21.319 --> 37:25.703
On the title page, he circled their two names, Lavender and Blaise.

37:28.505 --> 37:31.007
By way of the clearing book, it's a lot for the book.

37:31.207 --> 37:38.456
already expressed.

37:38.476 --> 37:44.023
When Blake wrote no one, he was surely thinking of the deserving few to whom he might lend them all.

37:44.764 --> 37:55.898
He hoped none of them would misunderstand the motives of his criticism, but possibly also of the unknown readers down through the years to whom his precious book might disherits.

37:56.350 --> 38:05.004
Thinking back, we can see that in one way or another, all the readers whose methods I have described, had it gone last prospect of knowledge.

38:05.925 --> 38:10.793
Francis Hargrave, painstakingly acquired professional knowledge, would go to benefit some other lawyer.

38:11.895 --> 38:18.325
Walpole's books would ensure that insider information about men and women at this time was all lost.

38:18.710 --> 38:27.101
Felicia Hemingway's friends and admirers would treasure her comments on books from their own collection and pass them on to her descendants.

38:27.121 --> 38:38.295
Hester Piazzi could display her active kindness and her remarkable reign of interest in perpetuity through her specially concocted presence.

38:38.315 --> 38:40.498
So it was Joel Evans.

38:40.518 --> 38:46.185
He never bought a book, but it became instantly a part of the household library.

38:47.093 --> 39:00.469
When he was almost 19, he bequeathed the collection, notes and all, to a public institution, reserving only a small number of books that he had for his profession, which he gave us a name to me.

39:00.489 --> 39:04.695
And those, too, were added to the bequest in the long run.

39:04.715 --> 39:14.907
There were, as far as he was concerned, no secrets from his marginality, and the public circulation of his books could do his posthumous reputation no damage.

39:16.220 --> 39:23.571
Understanding these circumstances, if we look again at some of the notes on the handout, we see them rather differently.

39:23.591 --> 39:29.340
For once in a fifth can he have made the remarkable works of the elephant's process of that.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.927
Why did he go to the trouble of spelling out his objection to the impiety of Dalmat?

39:35.049 --> 39:42.801
And why should he have needed to tell himself about the resolution of May 1776?

39:43.439 --> 39:48.984
there must be a third party involved in the Indian Greek.

39:49.004 --> 39:59.915
It seems that when Adams wrote those notes, he was more or less deliberately leaving a record of his opinions on matters about which his opinions might have been, or might come to be, misunderstood.

40:01.296 --> 40:09.644
At first, he can have expected only that chosen friends and members of the family, his direct descendants, would have access to the view expressed in his martini.

40:10.525 --> 40:13.007
But after the election was president, he may have

40:13.223 --> 40:14.965
that they would find a wider comment.

40:15.686 --> 40:19.812
Indeed, he thought to it that they should do so.

40:19.832 --> 40:25.479
He had austerity in mind.

40:25.499 --> 40:27.121
Allons had known that they had come down to us.

40:27.241 --> 40:28.163
There is this other fact.

40:28.904 --> 40:34.871
Allons had known that they had come down to us were subject to editorial selection.

40:34.911 --> 40:42.201
If you look at the other side of the handout, the photograph of that book from the French Revolution, you will see

40:42.923 --> 40:47.169
how densely common in the pages of Alice's chosen books might be.

40:48.171 --> 40:56.163
But you will also see some notes not recorded by Arash, specifically only on page 402.

40:57.145 --> 41:08.442
Press, epigrams, awkward figures, drastic gains, satyrs, and checks.

41:10.970 --> 41:14.114
It will be made at a different time from the long one.

41:15.055 --> 41:28.031
You will see that there is a log in either hand, and that Adams uses a log in the word jests, or if you have a thing, that he does not do after on the same page.

41:28.051 --> 41:36.522
Horashti never claimed, so the notes were written on different occasions, Horashti never claimed that his presentation of Adams was never too exhaustive.

41:36.805 --> 41:47.339
Indeed, he frequently describes books as containing, besides the interesting notes, quote, repetition of names, keywords, and short sentences that he eventually had deliberately suppressed.

41:49.682 --> 41:58.313
The very brief notes obviously did not fall into the category of studious, sorry, obviously do fall into the category of studious note-taking.

41:59.054 --> 42:05.783
And they typically represent, this is what I find rather interesting, a first income with the work.

42:05.982 --> 42:11.812
when the reader's effort is concentrated on following the authors, meaning not challenging them.

42:11.832 --> 42:17.982
So you see the indication that in some cases, at least, the challenging notes are done on rereadings.

42:19.364 --> 42:20.546
It's not his first thoughts.

42:24.213 --> 42:31.585
They're not printed, they're not original, they do not contribute much to our understanding of fandom that the champion has to, so they're set aside.

42:32.088 --> 42:39.415
But when we see him, we realize that there is more of the story of Alan's engaging with his book than an occasional lover's quarrel.

42:39.435 --> 42:47.062
Indeed, we realize that there is a story with plot development, not a static account of a sexual character and habitual behavior.

42:48.864 --> 42:55.089
Examining more books from Adam's library, we have carried in line the options available to him in the amount of time.

42:55.870 --> 43:01.015
And taking into account the less complicated kind of argumentation of those opinionated responses,

43:01.197 --> 43:17.623
we gain a more rounded picture of Adam as a reader, gradually evolving from pupil itch to antenna, at each stage leaving some traces and margins involved, and love taking charge.

43:19.847 --> 43:26.698
The publishers of all the books that you have on top of your sheet were the products of the century between 1884 or 1882.

43:27.691 --> 43:39.008
When I was first studying his work, he did so by the traditional methods of making a heading page and copying extracts into a column.

43:39.028 --> 43:46.379
It is clear from his diary that he has his troubles concentrating, so he used conventional study techniques in order to improve himself.

43:47.741 --> 43:55.352
He founds in his early diary like a hearteningly normal young man, though one that has standards when he laments.

43:55.838 --> 44:06.831
My thoughts are roving from girls to friends, from friends to court to Worcester, to Yankee and Uber Eats.

44:06.851 --> 44:15.681
Could I fix my attention and keep off every fluttering thought and attempt to truth on the subject?

44:15.701 --> 44:18.705
I could read a book all day.

44:18.725 --> 44:21.508
In sending the diary to a new resolution,

44:22.028 --> 44:29.720
I began to read the spirit of the laws and have resolved to read that work through in order and with attention.

44:29.740 --> 44:38.954
And I have hit upon a project that will secure my attention to it, which is, three guests, to write in a margin a sort of index to every paragraph.

44:40.396 --> 44:49.791
This sort of index to every paragraph translates into the headings and short sentences that are actually mentioned but did not include in his transcription.

44:50.615 --> 44:55.980
In his many years of legal practice, Adams obtained similar procedures for careful study.

44:56.901 --> 45:10.854
Though in 1761, he was still complaining that, though amid his participation, business, plagiaric conversation, intrigue, party, et cetera, what a moral can give attention to an old life in the Institute of Accounting Law?

45:12.175 --> 45:16.319
Or more probably, because he was still finding a hard focus.

45:16.840 --> 45:20.503
He kept a reading journal for Hale's History of the Community Crown.

45:21.142 --> 45:32.379
And soon he proceeded with other books that he had to work with professionally, moving back and forth between the margins and notebooks, writing heads in the books and storing extracts in the notes.

45:33.461 --> 45:44.618
We can see from the copy of Wollstonecraft's History of the French Revolution that the discipline of writing headings on purpose of serious study and assimilation was still living in 1790.

45:45.914 --> 46:00.727
The early sevens of free-range action recorded by Hirashti in a small book of notes that Adams made in the late 1750s or early 1760s in a copy of John Winthrop's lecture on Earthquakes.

46:00.747 --> 46:06.132
This book, the work of one of Adams' horror instructors, was a gift from a friend.

46:06.172 --> 46:12.438
Adams wrote a note at the end, carrying his own views on the controversy about all of the Earthquakes.

46:12.458 --> 46:14.820
People thought they came from Canada.

46:14.880 --> 46:15.921
Like your bad weather.

46:16.205 --> 46:24.259
So he declared his own opinions, and he engaged in some upgrading, recording further at Earthquake in 1761.

46:25.341 --> 46:30.390
These interventions, though more personal than the study notes, are still relatively restrained.

46:35.278 --> 46:39.225
I didn't hear the political activism statement.

46:42.732 --> 46:48.661
served as testing grounds for his own arguments, and his marginalia seemed to have become freer and more expressive.

46:50.044 --> 47:06.910
In France in 1784, he read a letter from Chagot to the radical British thinker, Richard Price, which excited him to make extensive marginal comments and eventually to propose his own defense of the constitutions of America in 1787.

47:06.930 --> 47:10.596
Writing notes clarified his thinking and helped him to articulate his ideas.

47:11.403 --> 47:17.950
I don't see it, however, as if it is of a lover's quarrel, one of the professional activity akin to drafting a position.

47:19.672 --> 47:30.104
Before he started work on his defense, he led the elevated bottom price to Ben and Frank, who had the notes transcribed into his own copy of the book.

47:30.124 --> 47:37.832
Early evidence, both of Adam's willingness to share his notes, and of the favorable reception we were likely to receive among his postcards.

47:38.555 --> 47:53.899
Adam similarly had a copy of his own discourses on novellas, to Mr. Coleman of Hymn, who he reportedly had had in almost a year, but had eventually returned in December of 1814.

47:55.582 --> 48:02.132
Circumstances changed again when Adam was returning, which is a phase in which all notes on the handout were written.

48:04.458 --> 48:12.810
well, the great aggression on every time I am in this game, but I want to get in and those that I find particularly touching.

48:13.952 --> 48:26.932
In a book on the influence of the passion of human happiness, that was read some chapter 1796, as the author, Melanie Stahl, points that for her people usually find it to leave a position of power.

48:26.952 --> 48:31.098
But she gives a few illustrious examples of extra women who managed to do it.

48:32.119 --> 48:33.942
And Adams proposes an addition.

48:35.660 --> 48:37.122
This is what he said.

48:37.142 --> 48:40.388
The example of Washington will be known in the future.

48:42.231 --> 48:44.374
Books and agriculture may fill the mine.

48:46.177 --> 48:48.962
That was certainly an unrest before successful retirement.

48:50.484 --> 48:55.693
When you consider a few of Adam's books relatively seeking to take notes in his hand,

48:56.062 --> 49:22.288
and observe that of the interesting published notes, perhaps 75% were written after 1800 and very few before 1790, we may wonder whether he did not come to see his commentary on these books, which he did not encounter in the first time, whether he did not come to see his commentary on these books as part of an intellectual legacy along with the publications of his earlier years.

49:22.488 --> 49:28.437
In the same period, we know he hadn't took to write his own biography, though that scheme was eventually abandoned.

49:29.298 --> 49:38.131
He published a series of letters of the Boston Patriot in what David McCullough refers to as his last passionate exercise in self-justification.

49:38.151 --> 49:42.037
And he shared reflections and reminiscences of the Czechoslovakian memoirs for us.

49:42.978 --> 49:45.962
He was in retrospective mode.

49:45.982 --> 49:49.187
I'm not claiming that this was necessarily a systematic project.

49:50.197 --> 50:00.270
The fact that more notes of the expensive kind belong to the years of Adams' retirement could be accounted for simply by his having had more time left for this enjoyable activity.

50:01.051 --> 50:07.159
And yet he must have known that he was leaving a record of his conviction on important political and religious concerns.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.605
So enjoyment could go hand in hand with a sense of purpose.

50:11.625 --> 50:18.955
It is remarkable, too, how much of all kinds the books that Adams chose to write in were, mainly

50:19.373 --> 50:26.926
Expectations of godless rationalists from whom Adams might well have found the need to distance him from.

50:26.946 --> 50:29.691
This possibility merits further investigation.

50:32.275 --> 50:40.690
Understanding that Adams' marginalia, unlike our own, were meant to be a theme, should be a further incentive to get them out into the public domain, probably what he wants.

50:41.615 --> 51:05.783
that Adam's books are more fully cataloged, more accurately described, and that the annotated pages are digitized and transcribed to complement other online Adam's project, it will be much easier for scholars to take stock of Adam's marginally and to see that he put his books, none of them anyway, to work in a variety of ways in the several stages of a long and big life.

51:06.134 --> 51:19.011
To the extent that the marginalia can be dated, and while they were not separated from others in the same volume, scholars will be able to map these readings and re-reading of the chronology of the book.

51:19.031 --> 51:35.432
The Lord Sandler, including the reader, coined the prevention of the book, so that he took advantage of pretty well all the options available to him, writing, adding, copying, adding supplementary material, and making a summary, like the diligence of the promise of the book.

51:36.037 --> 51:42.230
Writing illustrative comedy, like a British pen to share with friends and colleagues.

51:43.051 --> 51:51.649
Keeping records for posterity, like Horace Wilder, fighting back against British ideas like John Hornet Hook and William Blake.

51:51.967 --> 52:09.779
Thanks to advanced publicity by a prison critic, I knew before I ever laid hands on one of Adams' books that he was good at writing notes, but I had not perceived that he could stand in an epitheree of the customs of his age, given the range and flexibility of his library.

52:10.541 --> 52:15.730
About the only thing he seemed never to have done was to compile a personal index in the back of the book.

52:16.840 --> 52:22.547
A better understanding of what Adams was up to in his form of writing can only enrich the historical record.

52:24.650 --> 52:37.566
Scholarship and custodianship, the example of Adams' Mordinaria gives his admirers a new opportunity, something that looks to the future as well as to the past.

52:37.934 --> 52:50.155
And that is, by these means or others, to turn ourselves into the kind of real evil, engaged, tentative, skeptical, unfairness.

53:04.917 --> 53:05.898
Tomorrow?

53:05.918 --> 53:06.199
Sure.

53:06.800 --> 53:29.252
We've now come to the end of the paper, obviously, and if you have questions about the whole thing or any of that you wonder about, please, I'll try to remember to repeat.

53:29.272 --> 53:29.352
Yes.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.496
With Adams, did you find much evidence of a third reading where he would edit his own and change his mind?

53:31.516 --> 53:32.477
That's a good question.

53:32.812 --> 53:40.799
Did I find much evidence of a third or later reading in which he annotated his own annotations or changed his mind?

53:42.660 --> 53:44.001
Yes, definitely.

53:44.222 --> 53:46.223
Definitely more than three or more readings.

53:47.544 --> 53:52.509
And what he tends to do is to add a note, sometimes daily.

53:53.510 --> 54:02.397
So he will say, very true in 1794, and then he will say, still true in 1800.

54:05.262 --> 54:13.321
Very nice question, yes.

54:14.383 --> 54:23.524
As I say, there really was no inhibition of other people's, you know, what's it about through other people's ant, and I hope that other people have ant.

54:25.208 --> 54:32.940
It's a little bit hard in this library, I mean we don't separate, we're not yet in the state in which we can separate out all those hymns.

54:33.742 --> 54:39.831
So our primary job would be to separate out earlier owners and later ones.

54:40.172 --> 54:45.440
So because these books stay with the family for quite a long time.

54:45.460 --> 54:52.752
So some of the notes, some of them have inscriptions by later members of the family, John Quincy helps, for instance.

54:55.077 --> 55:01.106
And actually one more thing, I find it very, it's always particularly difficult to know about marks.

55:01.947 --> 55:04.050
You know, sometimes marks are really important.

55:04.110 --> 55:08.136
You know, when you work with one author, what he typically does.

55:09.378 --> 55:16.448
But if there were these little, in the book about earthquakes, for instance, there are some little pencil lines and crawls.

55:16.468 --> 55:18.351
And I don't know whether those are his or not.

55:18.820 --> 55:22.885
He doesn't have a lot.

55:22.905 --> 55:26.330
He doesn't have a lot.

55:27.191 --> 55:28.673
He doesn't have a lot.

55:29.574 --> 55:30.355
He doesn't have a lot.

55:30.375 --> 55:32.718
Of course he doesn't have a lot.

55:32.738 --> 55:32.838
Yeah.

55:32.858 --> 55:42.651
Do the notes reflect his station in life or the stages in life, particularly difficult periods like his falling out of a jet.

55:43.745 --> 56:09.195
um these are really not when we we see them as an expression of personality i don't think he saw them that way i think he didn't so that he he was probably trying to avoid very personal personal revelation and i haven't really read enough of them to say for sure whether he said anything nasty about jefferson i think not there are

56:09.462 --> 56:15.330
There are books in which he's recorded places with affection, places that he visited with you.

56:16.993 --> 56:31.774
And this may be partly because, as I said, so many of the books that are annotated with this, the word in way, were annotated after 1800 and after he resumed his friendship.

56:32.868 --> 56:38.899
A lot of it sounds like an extension of his diary, which is really a kind of intellectual diary, if you will.

56:38.919 --> 56:44.290
And then he's writing always with posterity over his shoulder.

56:44.310 --> 56:46.955
And he never writes down a paper.

56:46.975 --> 56:51.383
But the real difference between these notes and a true diary is they're not dated.

56:51.363 --> 57:07.887
which must be very frustrating because you don't know when he said so.

57:07.907 --> 57:08.749
Sometimes not even within decades.

57:08.769 --> 57:10.351
So that's the real difference.

57:10.451 --> 57:13.436
You can't show a progression or a response to certain events.

57:13.456 --> 57:16.140
It's just out there in a space with no time attack.

57:16.160 --> 57:16.841
Well, not entirely.

57:16.861 --> 57:19.805
And for instance, well, let it be 79, 4, 1800.

57:19.825 --> 57:20.085
Yes, too.

57:20.105 --> 57:21.167
But what happened where he

57:21.653 --> 57:29.809
say something that he wants strongly to endorse, he will date it.

57:30.591 --> 57:34.198
And then again, you can roughly date things.

57:34.619 --> 57:39.308
For instance, an oath account had been made before the book was published.

57:42.005 --> 57:44.368
So, you know, that's a story.

57:44.468 --> 57:46.652
It's really quite important.

57:46.892 --> 57:52.720
The Count of Annunziata before was published quite often, he wrote in the name of an ownership inscription with a date.

57:53.181 --> 57:55.624
So that shows when he acquired it.

57:55.644 --> 58:00.972
And then you can look at the opening that you have a picture of, you can look at the hat.

58:02.274 --> 58:03.996
That's less reliable.

58:04.246 --> 58:14.680
But you can see a difference between the hand that he used in his head in the Wollstonecraft book and say confidently for the other books for me and later.

58:15.281 --> 58:19.967
But there might have been two of the years of other novels, 1796 and 1812.

58:21.289 --> 58:26.876
But it is not impossible.

58:26.956 --> 58:28.498
Did you have a question?

58:29.204 --> 58:38.053
You mentioned, you're not noticing non-fiction.

58:38.073 --> 58:38.894
I know he also likes to read the written.

58:38.914 --> 58:40.395
Were there any annotations that were her favorite poems or passages?

58:41.096 --> 58:41.617
Very little.

58:41.717 --> 58:51.106
And I think I find this generally fiction not very much annotated in the period, unless you were doing it to the guy's poor friend.

58:51.967 --> 58:53.929
So instead of reading the book,

58:54.635 --> 59:01.844
with a friend, particularly someone who lives far away, for instance, you could send the book with your notes in it.

59:01.864 --> 59:05.348
That would be like talking to your friend about the book.

59:05.408 --> 59:10.635
But I think fiction is not very often annotated, and that's a reason why people assume you agree that only one.

59:15.221 --> 59:16.042
What about letter?

59:16.182 --> 59:22.269
Have you seen similar annotations in letters, or are they confined to the book?

59:22.289 --> 59:22.870
Well, I only look at books.

59:23.761 --> 59:29.749
Do you want to follow up on that?

59:29.769 --> 59:39.182
I'm currently reading the collected letters from Adams and Adams from Jefferson, and that's my question.

59:39.202 --> 59:48.975
I'm wondering if he or other authors of the period limited their position to the book or perhaps a character to the letters that they have made.

59:49.900 --> 59:51.602
Well, let's have everybody work with letters.

59:52.462 --> 59:54.785
People tend to letters, those also circulate.

59:55.606 --> 01:00:02.632
So there were, you know, really confidential letters practically well known once you send it out.

01:00:02.793 --> 01:00:07.697
And that's why letters are such a sophisticated form of writing.

01:00:08.198 --> 01:00:12.162
You know it's going to be a show around when you've got to get it right.

01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:17.747
So probably if everybody should, they might wait

01:00:18.149 --> 01:00:23.155
I don't know what rubbish in the margin, or where I defend, or something like that.

01:00:23.175 --> 01:00:31.364
And more often would you get on the letters of just the sort of practical dot received on such and such.

01:00:31.384 --> 01:00:34.608
But I don't know about Adam's done anything.

01:00:34.628 --> 01:00:41.676
Practically everyone in this room knows what happened now.

01:00:41.696 --> 01:00:44.219
Although I'm hanging through his boats with me.

01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:44.900
I like it.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.000
Yes.

01:00:45.233 --> 01:00:52.743
Was Adam able to read his books in any language such as German, Latin or Greek?

01:00:52.763 --> 01:00:55.446
Certainly Latin, certainly French.

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:55.866
Dutch.

01:00:57.448 --> 01:00:58.750
He... Dutch.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:02.094
He intentionally copies out Greek words.

01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:11.626
So he had a trade in Greek, up to a certain point, but I don't have any Greek choice.

01:01:11.646 --> 01:01:14.430
But certainly Dutch, French and Latin.

01:01:15.895 --> 01:01:28.574
Yes, of course, Judge.

01:01:28.975 --> 01:01:29.576
You tell me.

01:01:29.756 --> 01:01:43.317
I was wondering if you find that if your nation showed up at the right side of your personality, it perfectly could not be criticized at all times because of the way the ownership was not changing for generations or so?

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:44.198
Did everyone hear the question?

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:45.424
No.

01:01:47.085 --> 01:02:14.370
Jonathan Martinaglia revealed a lighter side of his personality which would have been concealed from his contemporaries outside of town.
