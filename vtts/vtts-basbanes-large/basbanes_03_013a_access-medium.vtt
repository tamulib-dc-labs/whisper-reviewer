00:02.562 --> 00:09.049
The tape reporter is running, and we're talking to Professor Harold Bloom this morning on the 3rd of August.

00:09.089 --> 00:11.852
You have so many books coming out, I have to say, in here.

00:12.753 --> 00:22.443
I love this new book, The Best Poems of the English Language, and I've been very fortunate to get an advanced copy of Where Shall Wisdom Be Found.

00:22.463 --> 00:26.127
Harold, where is all this energy coming from in all these different areas?

00:27.529 --> 00:30.392
Dear Nick, I hardly...

00:30.980 --> 00:34.204
recognize myself when you speak of energy.

00:34.765 --> 00:52.088
I have recently had a 74th birthday, and I do have to go to the gym every day at doctor's orders, and I come back so worn out that I am indeed now an old man, Nick.

00:52.108 --> 00:52.549
Energy.

00:53.990 --> 00:58.236
You know, I sometimes think, Nick,

00:59.262 --> 01:13.077
Though I don't want to thank them for it, but that what still keeps me going, you know, I'm going to go on teaching at Yale as long as I'm physically and mentally capable of it.

01:13.137 --> 01:25.350
Though I've termed NYU, and I will, of course, go on writing books as long as I have a mind fit for doing it.

01:26.291 --> 01:27.953
But I sometimes wonder...

01:31.477 --> 02:00.032
if what spurs me on is a kind of need for vindication, because though I never meant to be in any way belligerent, such has been the state of both, you might want to call it our university culture and our media culture,

02:00.552 --> 02:21.403
Each has degenerated so much that in crying out against this and crying out for cognitive and aesthetic standards and rejecting the garbage and the middle-browism and the whole thing, one has become a target.

02:21.863 --> 02:28.433
And I suppose one should expect that and one should accept it.

02:28.801 --> 02:38.055
but I certainly seem to have something about the way I write or the way I am, which, you might say, infuriates the opposition.

02:39.517 --> 02:41.259
I'm not sure I can tell you what that is.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.364
Perhaps you can tell me, my dear.

02:45.325 --> 02:49.932
But not only are you writing many books, but...

02:50.350 --> 02:53.854
They're all so stimulating, I have to say.

02:54.135 --> 02:56.157
I was going from one to the other last night.

02:56.197 --> 03:08.031
I had a pile of... Well, I guess, but I find something stimulating everywhere I turn.

03:08.472 --> 03:09.874
I'd like to start.

03:09.894 --> 03:15.901
I was so taken when I read a while back that you were placing your books, your library, at St.

03:15.941 --> 03:17.623
Michael's College in Vermont.

03:18.127 --> 03:21.971
when they're not, except for a certain number.

03:22.071 --> 03:28.077
I mean, first of all, the addition to the library that they're building is pretty good, kind enough to call it.

03:28.157 --> 03:33.862
A reading room is not yet fully funded, and it's not known when construction will begin.

03:33.882 --> 03:43.712
And, you know, the core of my library, which I need to continue to work with, they will not receive until I am...

03:44.536 --> 03:46.599
No longer able to use it, shall we say.

03:46.619 --> 03:49.262
What is called, in the great perhaps.

03:50.884 --> 03:53.568
But I chose St.

03:53.628 --> 04:00.998
Michael College for my, not only for my library, but for my archives.

04:02.259 --> 04:11.792
All the letters I've kept of remarkable writers whom I've had correspondence.

04:12.380 --> 04:24.377
My notebooks, my... What am I saying?

04:27.502 --> 04:29.965
My... My published manuscript.

04:30.065 --> 04:34.131
In many cases, I haven't chosen to publish them.

04:34.352 --> 04:37.436
It's a massive archive.

04:37.456 --> 04:38.758
Do you annotate your books?

04:39.194 --> 04:57.531
I have in recent years, after years of treating them as though they were library books, I think I was partly converted by reading that splendid book by, is it a Mrs. Jackson, Unmemorabilia, which I reviewed.

04:58.472 --> 05:05.659
And I just served as a reader for Yale Press for the follow-up volume, which is pretty much unromantic memorabilia.

05:05.679 --> 05:07.260
I now...

05:07.915 --> 05:24.020
For instance, I am writing a book that no doubt will make me reviled by an entire new set of antagonists.

05:24.821 --> 05:32.193
I am writing a book called The Names Divine, four colon, Jesus and Yahweh.

05:32.213 --> 05:34.817
And the essential argument is that...

05:35.860 --> 05:59.505
Well, first of all, of course, and it's too obvious, it should be worth more than remarking that Yeshua of Nazareth, the historical figure about whom we know virtually nothing, has very little relation whatsoever to the Jesus Christ of the Gospels, let alone of Trinitarian and subsequent theology.

05:59.975 --> 06:23.451
But that is the major aspect of the book, the major argument of the book, is the demonstration that Jesus the Christ, God the Father, the Holy Spirit, all these are gods of one kind, and Yahweh, the, as it were, original god of this tradition,

06:23.887 --> 06:45.997
Actually, I think if he survives today, except among that small remnant of my, I cannot say my co-religionist, because though I certainly identify myself with everything Jewish, and it's with me, I, um, I do not trust in the covenant, and for good reason.

06:46.017 --> 06:52.666
Um, and by some medical definition, that, uh, means I'm not a co-religionist in anyone.

06:52.686 --> 06:52.746
Um,

06:58.092 --> 07:14.971
The essential point is that Yahweh, and this last could also be almost in passing, but it's sure to make people furious that if you want a sign of him being abroad in the world, it is as the Allah of the Koran and everything that has followed since.

07:15.031 --> 07:25.703
That has far more in common with the Yahweh of Tanakh, of the Hebrew Bible, than the Christian God and the Father does that learn Jesus the Christ.

07:26.392 --> 07:35.043
But I find that writing this, I've had to acquire an almost entire new library of books, which I've been absorbing and annotating very freely indeed.

07:36.725 --> 07:48.119
Do you feel that you can know an author, an author that you're particularly fond of, or who moves you profoundly by knowing the books that they read?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.762
Do you try to know...

07:51.333 --> 07:51.813
Yes.

07:52.114 --> 07:55.477
I mean, would you like to have Shakespeare's reading list, for instance?

07:55.517 --> 07:56.338
Yes, yes.

07:56.358 --> 08:09.910
I mean, scholars have sort of worked out what it probably was, and one can surmise that in the end it was fairly restricted.

08:10.010 --> 08:14.554
He had never read Homer except in Chapman's version.

08:15.235 --> 08:20.800
He had certainly read often in the original, as well as in Golding's

08:21.961 --> 08:22.602
version.

08:26.045 --> 08:28.527
Virgil, I think, does not mean that much to him.

08:31.029 --> 08:38.415
Chaucer, the Geneva Bible, which is essentially, in the end, William Tyndale.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.858
His precursors are William Tyndale and Geoffrey Chaucer, clearly.

08:42.539 --> 08:47.763
They are the writers who most deeply influence him and to whom he is indebted.

08:50.105 --> 08:51.867
Marlow, of course, is a

08:52.943 --> 08:58.711
dangerous stimulant and starting point whom he transcends.

08:59.092 --> 09:02.296
I'm not sure that much else matters.

09:03.117 --> 09:04.660
I mean, in general.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.605
In general, the general principle, yes.

09:09.206 --> 09:18.559
It's the kind of critical approach that I have partly inherited and partly, I think, transformed.

09:19.821 --> 09:22.765
I would insist that it's absolutely vital...

09:24.803 --> 09:35.367
I mean, you tell us in any number of your books how to read and why, where shall wisdom be around, and I'm wondering, I think we're approaching at least 30 books now, right?

09:35.388 --> 09:43.386
I believe that would be, since that huge anthology is really a book by me, it's got...

09:44.480 --> 09:52.089
750 pages of poetry and 250 pages of commentary quite frequently on poems that there was no room to include.

09:52.109 --> 09:55.773
And I think that Harper's is actually going to bring out the commentary.

09:55.793 --> 10:05.724
It's going to bring out just the introduction as a separate little volume, not the intensive commentaries.

10:05.784 --> 10:13.693
But I think that the, when this, I hope, a year from this October, when this, um,

10:14.078 --> 10:16.020
Jesus and Yahweh book is published.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.323
That will actually be the 30th by actual count.

10:18.824 --> 10:19.885
That'll be very exciting.

10:20.586 --> 10:27.435
I wonder, a scholar intent on hindering the reading, you used the phrase deep reading.

10:28.055 --> 10:32.901
If we really want to know the depth of your reading, will it be essential to go to St.

10:32.921 --> 10:41.112
Michael College and to go through those 25,000 volumes whenever they get there or however many get there?

10:41.132 --> 10:42.313
Well, I suppose...

10:42.952 --> 10:45.956
That would be part of it, but of course I have relied.

10:46.938 --> 10:53.407
Yale University has, you know, one of the four great libraries in the United States, and therefore in the world.

10:54.748 --> 11:06.765
Harvard, Yale, the Library of Congress, the 42nd Street Library, are the four great libraries in the United States.

11:08.315 --> 11:13.840
I have had the library as a resource for ever since I got here as a graduate student.

11:13.860 --> 11:17.524
Good heavens, that's 54 years ago.

11:17.724 --> 11:17.884
Amazing.

11:18.585 --> 11:19.746
The autumn of 1950.

11:19.766 --> 11:25.932
Do you read principally, I mean, do you read in other languages or is it largely when you're reading physical works in other languages?

11:26.072 --> 11:36.162
I read, well, where it is a work of imaginative fiction

11:37.677 --> 12:04.579
poetry um you know. If it really does qualify as what we want to call literature rather than as commentary whether inspired or not, um yes if I know the original, I take pains to read it and reread it in the original. So proof you'll do in French. I invariably will read in French. I however unfortunately

12:04.913 --> 12:08.497
They are lacunae, and I am too old now to remedy them.

12:08.637 --> 12:09.578
I wish very much.

12:10.319 --> 12:12.601
And when I was younger, I had learned to read Russian.

12:13.542 --> 12:23.713
It's particularly ironic because my father was born and raised in Odessa, but he spoke Yiddish around the house, and he wanted to forget the Russian language, because he did not like the Russian.

12:23.913 --> 12:29.119
And as I recall, you indicated that you taught yourself to read English by the age of five.

12:29.139 --> 12:32.322
Yes, I heard no spoken English.

12:33.128 --> 12:40.236
I mean, I was in the streets directly around our apartment, but they all spoke Yiddish out in the street.

12:41.638 --> 12:46.703
This was way over on the old east side of the Bronx in the early 1930s.

12:47.144 --> 12:52.049
So the language of the street was Yiddish, and the language at home was Yiddish.

12:52.730 --> 12:58.236
I taught myself to read English before I could speak it.

12:58.256 --> 13:01.600
The result is, as my friend and a poet critic John Hollander,

13:01.883 --> 13:06.210
is always telling me with disapproval I mispronounce everything.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.834
I've invented my own pronunciation.

13:08.854 --> 13:26.322
George Bernard Shaw, long ago in his losing fight to change English spelling, pointed out that the way English is spelled and the way it is pronounced is amazingly dissimilar.

13:26.582 --> 13:26.963
He...

13:27.517 --> 13:37.291
You mentioned, on any number of different occasions, how Samuel Johnson, I guess, and Hazlitt are your two heroes as readers.

13:38.753 --> 13:39.714
Tell me a little bit.

13:39.894 --> 13:45.963
In English, Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt.

13:48.746 --> 13:52.832
I have a great love for Walter Pader, but he...

13:53.437 --> 13:57.664
He deliberately kept his range narrower than they did.

13:57.684 --> 14:13.271
Johnson, it is fair to say, had read everything, and not just for the coirmation of literature now, but anything that an educated mind could read that was available up to the time of his death.

14:13.291 --> 14:18.600
I mean, to find that kind of

14:19.137 --> 14:23.401
paragon of learning in literary critic again is just impossible.

14:23.962 --> 14:49.127
Hazlitt, um, equally true, um, though once you got beyond, uh, what you might want to call high literature and, um, actually philosophy in his case, um, which he read copiously as Johnson did, um, and of course, uh, all questions about history were a great interest to Hazlitt also, uh,

14:49.951 --> 14:58.583
But the range and scope are a little less wide than Johnson, so, of course, much more was available.

15:01.127 --> 15:17.190
There have been other learned critics in the English and American traditions, but, you know, let's say, well, really literary critics or writers, um...

15:20.410 --> 15:35.977
But they're not of the eminence, critically speaking, or in terms of general literary accomplishment of Samuel Johnson and William Hazlitt.

15:36.097 --> 15:38.301
So I suppose, yes, I would have to say...

15:38.990 --> 15:42.475
They remain forever impossible ideas.

15:42.495 --> 15:45.259
Ruskin would be a third, I think.

15:47.042 --> 15:54.653
What dazzles you most about these readers, the depth of their reading or their ability to... I think it's Boswell.

15:54.693 --> 16:07.191
It may be someone else, but it may have been Boswell, who described what it was like being with Johnson when he suddenly received a new book in the mail.

16:08.015 --> 16:10.898
or he had picked it up at a bookstore, but it had been given to him.

16:12.199 --> 16:30.677
And there's actually a wonderful painting of him doing that, one of Reynolds' many portraits of him, in which you can see indeed that he is, you know, devouring it, and yet at the same time discarding what he doesn't want.

16:31.698 --> 16:35.862
I don't know if he would tear his heart out.

16:36.854 --> 16:45.044
He had extraordinary energy and ferocity, indeed, as a reader.

16:45.865 --> 16:49.068
I cannot say that I read in quite that way anymore.

16:49.249 --> 16:50.370
I used to be like that.

16:51.972 --> 17:04.887
Indeed, I had freakish built-in mechanical aids when I was young, all through my young manhood, on through...

17:05.778 --> 17:09.101
Most of middle age and early old age.

17:09.201 --> 17:19.550
Now at 74, my once absolutely insane reading rate has slowed down unless I deliberately rev it up.

17:19.570 --> 17:33.523
And my once, even to me, incredible ability to hold on word for word where

17:34.229 --> 17:37.294
it had impressed me enough and wanted it to, even if it were prose.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.199
That isn't quite what it was.

17:40.359 --> 17:48.993
So still, if I, you know, find a really good poem that I've never seen before, it will memorize itself.

17:49.093 --> 17:49.874
I will present it.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.297
You're anticipating my question.

17:51.317 --> 17:58.769
I was allowed to ask, do you mindfully commit these pieces to memory, or is it just part of the apparatus you have?

17:58.789 --> 18:01.553
Even though I attempt...

18:02.866 --> 18:04.748
to teach my students to do that.

18:05.049 --> 18:08.693
I work at persuading them to try it.

18:08.813 --> 18:10.836
I think they find it very peculiar at first.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.920
I make clear it's not that I want them to learn anything by rote.

18:14.741 --> 18:19.707
I simply say, look, take Tennyson's Ulysses, which are just as an instance.

18:20.488 --> 18:21.509
It's sort of my favorite.

18:21.610 --> 18:31.262
I said, you know, or take indeed something rather more substantial, powerful as Tennyson's Ulysses is.

18:31.642 --> 18:32.383
Take, uh,

18:34.490 --> 18:55.620
take indeed uh walk with minutes as i ever put the ocean of life and let it find you as coleridge would say read it out loud whether to yourself or others mostly to yourself indoors or outdoors until you find uh

18:55.904 --> 18:58.767
That in a profound way, you do possess it by memory.

18:59.608 --> 19:00.909
Now, you have Coleridge's.

19:01.209 --> 19:03.432
You personally go to Yale at the Beinecke, I believe.

19:03.452 --> 19:08.337
They have his books with all of his marginal adaptations in there.

19:08.357 --> 19:09.858
Have you ever had a chance to go over?

19:09.878 --> 19:15.464
Well, you know, it's some years now since I've spent any time in the Beinecke.

19:15.504 --> 19:21.490
But in the past, I've gone through a great deal of what they have.

19:21.875 --> 19:25.139
That's a fabulous archive, I would think.

19:25.159 --> 19:29.685
In fact, they're publishing those that marginally, I think, of its own right.

19:29.705 --> 19:34.612
His observations on these books is quite remarkable.

19:35.092 --> 19:38.317
There have been previous collections, though, though I think they're a bit partial.

19:38.737 --> 19:46.307
Tell me a bit, before we go off in other directions, but you are addressing yourself to wisdom literature.

19:47.449 --> 19:49.131
I think...

19:50.444 --> 19:55.291
Uh, you had the kindness to already have read that book called Her Show Wisdom.

19:55.852 --> 19:57.134
Yes.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.538
Um, very few people have, of course, as yet.

19:59.878 --> 20:18.827
Um, I had a copy sent to the critic in my generation I continue to admire most, Angus Fletcher, who was a lifelong friend since we first met in, uh, the autumn of, uh, 54 at the Yale Hall of Graduate Studies.

20:18.847 --> 20:19.067
Um,

20:19.840 --> 20:23.946
When I first, no, no, the fall of 51, actually.

20:24.606 --> 20:30.274
That's when I got here as a graduate student, the fall of 51, and met Angus almost immediately.

20:30.294 --> 20:36.723
I asked to send it to Angus, and then not with a view to endorsements.

20:36.843 --> 20:39.306
I am beyond that.

20:39.486 --> 20:45.915
I don't say that out of pride, but because obviously enough, what can anybody say at this point?

20:47.583 --> 20:50.066
another slab at the old meatloaf.

20:53.150 --> 20:58.336
But he very kindly phoned me after he'd read it thoughtfully, and he's a considerable reader.

20:58.356 --> 21:15.818
And he said, you know, Harold, it makes me understand, he said, I think I've read everything you've published, he said, and some things you haven't published, he said, and he said, it makes me understand the rest of you much better, and I feel that in a sense,

21:16.726 --> 21:20.811
It just makes explicit what's always been implicit in you.

21:21.311 --> 21:22.553
This is what you're looking for.

21:23.774 --> 21:46.260
We had discussed earlier that you talk about one of the great paradoxes or certainly ironies involving yourself is that because of this remarkable dedication that you have to reading, you actually became physically ill from... I think I lived my life in many ways in the wrong way.

21:46.898 --> 21:53.889
I think that, uh, no, I wouldn't say it was the devotion to, uh, to reading.

21:56.153 --> 21:59.979
Having led so inactive a life, let me put it that way.

22:02.643 --> 22:12.940
Um, I was really, uh, as I came up, uh, it will be years, this coming, um,

22:13.949 --> 22:16.291
September, since my total collapse.

22:17.513 --> 22:23.379
Uh, I'm in much better condition now, though still not in great condition.

22:23.659 --> 22:27.863
My health is much better than I thought last year than I couldn't, of course, the year before.

22:28.924 --> 22:35.511
Um, you know, I can't blame that on reading.

22:35.591 --> 22:36.913
I can only blame that on me.

22:38.074 --> 22:38.134
Um,

22:38.452 --> 22:47.083
But I guess what I'm driving at is the therapeutic, I hate to use that word, but the therapeutic power of the reading.

22:47.204 --> 22:54.954
And I would imagine what you have described is this wisdom literature to help you restore yourself.

22:55.795 --> 23:00.441
Well, it never left one.

23:00.621 --> 23:05.067
I kept myself going at the worst of times in the hospital.

23:05.637 --> 23:09.762
And I was there for a long time by just reciting poems to myself.

23:10.543 --> 23:18.172
And since I was in a private room, usually I recited him out loud to myself and thought about him.

23:20.055 --> 23:30.588
But, no, I wouldn't want... I mean, the importance of exercise I now absolutely know.

23:31.569 --> 23:32.370
And...

23:33.903 --> 23:41.250
Since my personal trainer is leaving, I will no longer go to the downtown gym here.

23:41.430 --> 23:53.482
Instead, this Saturday, we are purchasing a treadmill, which will be installed upstairs here in my house and all the other equipment.

23:53.502 --> 24:00.889
From now on, I will do all my prescribed exercises here for up to an hour and a half a day.

24:01.342 --> 24:06.128
Had I been doing that all my life, these things would not have happened to me.

24:06.148 --> 24:08.190
But that had nothing to do with reading one.

24:08.210 --> 24:14.258
One could still have read everything one had read and been rational about it.

24:14.458 --> 24:21.266
I had asked you once if there's any book that felt you should have read that you haven't.

24:21.366 --> 24:23.128
And you were amused by the suggestion.

24:23.148 --> 24:27.754
And I have to say, you're the only intellect of consequence I have ever met.

24:28.156 --> 24:31.220
who has actually suggested that he's ready.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.122
Has he put it to you?

24:33.222 --> 24:34.664
Has he put it to you?

24:34.704 --> 24:35.785
Isn't that wonderful?

24:35.805 --> 24:41.952
The literal translation goes, the flesh is sad, alas, and I have read all the books.

24:43.053 --> 24:45.036
No, I can't think of anything.

24:46.437 --> 24:52.785
I can think of all the things I want to reread, and I hope there is time in whatever remaining years I have.

24:53.085 --> 24:57.150
I don't have to reread Shakespeare because I teach him...

24:57.518 --> 25:09.877
all year long, every year, and I don't have to reread all the poetry I care most for because I teach it all year long, every year.

25:10.498 --> 25:19.553
You've also written that universities really don't teach reading for pleasure anymore, and I know this is something.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.918
Nick, it is very hard to say

25:23.489 --> 25:25.351
I mean, there are honorable exceptions.

25:25.491 --> 25:28.235
There are real teachers still at many universities.

25:30.177 --> 25:49.480
But as you know, the universities of the English-speaking world, universities and AP colleges of the English-speaking world, are in a deep sense willing victims of that whole phenomenon that if you stand back from far enough,

25:50.540 --> 26:06.696
was beginning in the late 60s and early 70s, and, uh, it's still called by the archaic and inaccurate term, the counterculture, since the fact it has become a culture.

26:06.716 --> 26:15.244
The culture of the New York Times is what was the counterculture in the late 60s, and this is not a good thing, not a good thing at all.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.327
Um, but there's nothing to be done about it.

26:19.248 --> 26:19.568
Um,

26:20.813 --> 26:32.423
The parameters of the university are the parameters of the what might be called the elite construction of society.

26:33.284 --> 26:44.554
And I make clear that I'm saying this as a liberal Democrat who regards the Republican Party as the enemies of the human race.

26:44.574 --> 26:47.797
And I'm from Massachusetts, so you can be sure I share the sentiment.

26:47.817 --> 26:50.820
Yes, but by the way, Nick, I have very little hope.

26:51.188 --> 26:52.170
Oh, don't say that.

26:52.591 --> 27:04.257
Well, I think the Democrats made a... I think Kerry took very bad advice on the convention when they said, you know, we have to be gentler and kinder.

27:04.358 --> 27:05.320
That's ridiculous.

27:06.182 --> 27:09.028
And not have direct personal attacks.

27:09.278 --> 27:10.380
on President Bush.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.623
That was an incredible mistake.

27:12.683 --> 27:21.135
The result is that there has been no bump in the polls, and indeed some polls now show that since the convention, Kerry is down a point or two.

27:21.616 --> 27:23.158
I was reading the Washington Post poll.

27:23.198 --> 27:24.941
It's a little more hopeful.

27:24.961 --> 27:28.086
Incredible, stupid mistake.

27:28.186 --> 27:30.409
And the one quotable line that he had,

27:30.389 --> 27:42.549
And that whole speech is where he actually went on the attack a little bit, talked about we won't have a vice president who will meet secretly with polluters, and we won't have an attorney general who doesn't respect the trust.

27:42.569 --> 27:45.033
Yeah, but it was practically a throwaway.

27:45.073 --> 27:54.709
What the speech should have been about was tracing the entire intersection of the House of Bush and the House of Sald,

27:55.229 --> 28:01.597
It should have devoted a considerable time to the sense in which the war against Iraq is Halliburton's war.

28:03.220 --> 28:07.305
They should have showed the Michael Moore movie is what they should have done.

28:07.325 --> 28:08.907
I don't know if you've had a chance to see it.

28:08.927 --> 28:10.850
No, I haven't seen it, but my wife has.

28:10.870 --> 28:12.031
It's been described to me.

28:12.051 --> 28:24.848
I don't think, from what I've been told, they could quite get away with that, but they should certainly have taken some of that ground and held it at all costs.

28:26.836 --> 28:31.887
I gave up on them and would not watch the convention when it was clear what they were doing.

28:32.328 --> 28:40.065
And I believe, from what I'm told by people in the Kerry campaign, that belatedly they realized they have more.

28:40.085 --> 28:43.613
Well, you know, it's getting a little late to... It is too late now.

28:43.829 --> 28:52.997
William Blake, you've chosen a painting of Blake to use on the stories and poems for extremely intelligent children.

28:53.017 --> 28:54.438
I just love that title, by the way.

28:54.859 --> 28:58.462
It is a somewhat aggressive title.

28:59.182 --> 29:02.786
I can ascribe it, however, to my good friend and yours.

29:03.606 --> 29:09.652
Indeed, I regard him as my adopted son, our agent Glenn Hartley, who is very good.

29:09.932 --> 29:12.674
I'm good on titles, but Glenn came up with that one.

29:12.754 --> 29:13.515
Did he really?

29:13.563 --> 29:17.767
I said, I'm going to call it stories and poems for children of all ages.

29:18.587 --> 29:24.632
He said, Harold, he said, let's say for extremely intelligent children.

29:24.652 --> 29:27.595
And why is that an important distinction, do you think, to make?

29:27.975 --> 29:43.468
Well, because I think an extremely intelligent child lay ill to fashion long enough to read the Harry Potter garbage, but

29:45.727 --> 29:57.041
It gives that child a chance to, especially with some adults who really appreciate what it is, to read the Alice books.

29:57.061 --> 29:58.345
I mean, I don't have to go on.

29:58.365 --> 29:59.348
It's too obvious.

30:00.053 --> 30:09.567
But you also make the distinction that you don't make the distinction between, quote, children's literature and... No, no, no.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.330
I'm going to say children of all ages.

30:11.370 --> 30:12.391
Children of all ages.

30:12.511 --> 30:19.041
Clearly, clearly, there is something in our response to imaginative literature.

30:19.392 --> 30:23.358
which has something to do with the child who's always alive in us still.

30:23.378 --> 30:25.721
But why is Blake so appropriate?

30:25.782 --> 30:28.466
Blake is one of my all-time favorites, I have to say.

30:28.986 --> 30:44.910
Well, the poets I started with and first in love with were... So this is Clark Crane, Wallace Stevens, William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley.

30:45.481 --> 30:48.104
and that Blake has never left me.

30:48.245 --> 30:53.832
I wrote two books about it and he haunts me all the time.

30:56.415 --> 31:13.598
But of course Blake made a very wise distinction between what he called organized innocence and ignorance and

31:14.641 --> 31:19.006
That, I think, is extremely imaginative.

31:19.026 --> 31:20.788
There's a pretty interesting reader.

31:20.848 --> 31:26.395
There's a person who taught himself languages so he could... Oh, yes, no, Blake was.

31:27.416 --> 31:33.903
I mean, none of us, William Blake, Blake was an astonishing and amazing phenomenon.

31:33.923 --> 31:35.285
Was he tortured, in your view?

31:35.966 --> 31:36.346
I think it was.

31:36.386 --> 31:37.287
Was he tortured?

31:38.048 --> 31:38.369
Oh, yes.

31:38.989 --> 31:42.133
Yes, he was tormented by...

31:44.543 --> 31:58.582
In the end, I think, though he dies at 70, one believes the account given by his disciples that he was joyous on his death, sang his own songs.

32:00.785 --> 32:04.329
And, of course, he also had that great gift.

32:05.151 --> 32:07.374
He was also the visual artist.

32:07.394 --> 32:10.257
So we see this.

32:10.538 --> 32:14.483
I chose this because...

32:15.070 --> 32:22.618
It seemed to me to do what I wanted it to do.

32:22.638 --> 32:32.809
Just as I said, I've been using Michelangelo's for a long time now, so hence the cover part of a series of the Where Shall Wisdom Be Found.

32:33.670 --> 32:35.973
And I usually go to the Sistine Chapel for them.

32:36.934 --> 32:42.900
I've realized already that with this Jesus and Yahweh book, I cannot use Michelangelo.

32:43.623 --> 32:55.218
Indeed, I've already, in a sense, used the Michelangelo I would have used in the cover for the book called Genius.

32:55.258 --> 32:59.604
With Adam and the Finger of God and so on.

32:59.624 --> 33:03.409
I think that will have to be an abstract cover.

33:03.429 --> 33:07.093
I was talking with Helen Vendler a couple of weeks ago.

33:07.113 --> 33:10.778
Someone who is very dear to me, but I don't think I've actually seen him.

33:11.197 --> 33:24.179
Helen, who I've known since she was a graduate student at Harvard, and I was the young instructor here, so I guess I've known Helen now.

33:24.579 --> 33:30.369
It's got to be almost half a century.

33:30.429 --> 33:31.631
She's wonderful.

33:32.572 --> 33:35.938
But I have not actually seen her for four or five years.

33:36.408 --> 33:39.633
We occasionally exchange a phone call or a note.

33:39.793 --> 33:41.416
I gather she's going strong.

33:41.476 --> 33:42.017
She is.

33:42.037 --> 33:48.667
She's still actively teaching full-time at Harvard, as I am at Yale.

33:48.687 --> 33:57.260
And the subject of canonization came up, of course, and the formulation, the acceptance of a canon.

33:57.280 --> 34:02.008
And it is her view that I said, well, how does a work become canonical?

34:02.569 --> 34:04.812
And she ascribes this to other writers.

34:05.028 --> 34:07.190
Well, that is my own view, as you know.

34:07.410 --> 34:11.434
And she said that's also Harold's view.

34:11.454 --> 34:11.754
Yes.

34:12.715 --> 34:23.466
Canonization takes place because a great writer knows what cannot be avoided and what he must come to some kind of terms with.

34:24.166 --> 34:26.068
But they're always, I think, ambivalent terms.

34:26.429 --> 34:33.195
And yes, it is in a deep...

34:33.547 --> 34:41.776
In a deep sense, Keith is chosen by Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelites.

34:41.956 --> 34:58.113
Shelley is chosen by Browning, by Swinburne, by William Butler Yeats, by an entire tradition including Thomas Hardy.

34:58.133 --> 35:01.456
But my point is... He's not just Hardy's favorite poet.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.418
He was an obsession with Hardy.

35:04.073 --> 35:13.588
My point, then, is when people attack you for what you wrote in the Western canon, it's not as if you pulled these things out of it.

35:13.768 --> 35:16.673
No, I made it very clear.

35:16.893 --> 35:21.220
You know, it's very interesting.

35:22.001 --> 35:32.477
One doesn't get many reviews of an anthology, even one with as much prose in it by oneself as poems.

35:33.149 --> 35:38.454
And I won't read reviews anymore anyway, whether they're favorable or unfavorable.

35:38.735 --> 35:39.655
I just don't care.

35:39.936 --> 35:42.518
It's just that I haven't got time.

35:42.879 --> 35:48.184
I know that there's no point.

35:48.204 --> 35:51.888
It's like somebody trying to get me to read a review of my teaching.

35:52.628 --> 35:56.072
I can only shrug and say, I'm 74 years old.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.815
I teach the way I teach.

35:59.595 --> 36:01.317
And as far as reviewers are concerned,

36:01.820 --> 36:04.764
I'm 74 years old, and I write the way I write.

36:04.784 --> 36:05.205
That's that.

36:06.126 --> 36:09.090
And I judge things the way I judge them.

36:10.953 --> 36:17.763
But I would have thought... I would be wrong.

36:17.783 --> 36:20.487
There's a Marxist critic who shall be nameless.

36:20.587 --> 36:23.391
I didn't read his review, but Glenn told me about it.

36:23.411 --> 36:31.202
Who reviewed a university Marxist critic, who reviewed the best poems, the Virginia Quarterly Review.

36:31.857 --> 36:49.176
And he objected to it, saying that Bloom just prints the old chestnuts, the old chestnuts, Milton's listeners, you know, and his intimations owed, and as much Paradise Lost, and as much Whitman, the old chestnuts.

36:49.616 --> 36:59.808
And then he said, and he continues his endless war against black and women poets, which really made me burst out loud.

37:00.208 --> 37:01.189
The endless war.

37:01.793 --> 37:04.215
against black and women poets.

37:04.235 --> 37:24.936
And Alice Walker is suffering, I guess, because of the poetry of the great Alice Walker, or the poetry of that great prophet Tessa, the inspired Adrienne Rich, who proclaims to the world that only lesbianism can save a woman's autonomy.

37:26.978 --> 37:31.142
You know, there is a purpose to talking in this direction, because

37:31.460 --> 37:36.005
You see this NEA report that came out a couple of weeks ago.

37:36.125 --> 37:36.846
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.751
I am a consultant on their Shakespeare project.

37:40.791 --> 37:43.614
Dana had me send this.

37:45.597 --> 37:51.003
I responded to it by telephone with the Los Angeles Times, which printed up my response.

37:51.243 --> 37:52.044
You can find it.

37:52.485 --> 37:53.225
I'll find it.

37:53.245 --> 37:57.130
Yeah, which I said, no, I thought this was wrong.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.070
There had always been readers and non-readers.

38:03.090 --> 38:07.136
It went right through human history and national history.

38:07.657 --> 38:09.961
That hasn't changed very much.

38:11.683 --> 38:23.522
I did say that fear was one profound difference simply cannot be helped because you cannot take the computer out of the house or out of the library or out of the classroom.

38:27.367 --> 38:29.690
I teach only undergraduates now.

38:29.791 --> 38:33.776
I don't want to teach graduate students anymore.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.739
It's been that way for the last couple of years.

38:35.839 --> 38:46.455
I feel that at my age and with my views, I am irrelevant for them, and I should not put my energies into that.

38:46.916 --> 38:50.080
Nor do I think I can do them any good.

38:50.861 --> 38:55.348
So I teach undergraduates, and very good undergraduates indeed.

38:55.632 --> 38:58.175
They're at least as good as they've ever been here.

38:58.475 --> 38:59.696
Well, that's excellent.

38:59.756 --> 39:20.457
But I do remark in this, you know, these remarks in the Los Angeles Times, there is a difference that 25 years ago, they would arrive at Yale having read a great deal more than they have read now.

39:20.477 --> 39:23.040
And that clearly has to do with television,

39:23.982 --> 39:28.648
to some extent, motion pictures, and above all else, the computer.

39:28.668 --> 39:30.951
That is to say, we are in the age of the screen.

39:31.151 --> 39:35.576
We are in the age of interest, almost undifferentiated information.

39:36.718 --> 39:50.976
And that means, as I say in this, that I find a kind of dilemma in teaching Shakespeare, because as I teach Shakespeare, as I want people to learn to read and appreciate Shakespeare, you must have choice.

39:51.076 --> 39:53.719
You must have read.

39:54.745 --> 40:14.247
enough of the Canterbury Tales to see that without Chaucer, I won't say no Shakespeare, but certainly not the Shakespeare who developed.

40:14.267 --> 40:20.854
So you can't any longer, even with a very good junior or senior,

40:21.610 --> 40:36.582
take certain things for granted that you could take for granted um 25 years ago you know you think when the great russian novels were written i don't think 80 percent of the russian population was literate you know no i think i think that is quite true but of course

40:37.405 --> 40:39.888
It all depends what you mean by literate.

40:40.109 --> 40:45.596
Technically speaking, since he actually got a Yale BA, I'm very suspicious of that.

40:46.437 --> 40:51.784
And to my horror, Yale gave him an honorary degree the other year or so when he was president.

40:53.687 --> 40:56.891
George W. Bush is semi-literate at best.

40:56.911 --> 40:58.053
At best.

40:58.073 --> 40:58.473
At best.

40:59.054 --> 41:01.978
You know, when he was doing that thing on 9-11, it was my pet goat.

41:02.262 --> 41:04.807
My feeling is he was in over his head.

41:05.188 --> 41:06.491
That's why he was so silent.

41:06.691 --> 41:10.018
The man is programmed.

41:12.783 --> 41:18.074
I suppose a committee of Cheney, Rummy, Condi.

41:18.455 --> 41:19.176
Condi, yeah.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.942
Who's very close to him and to Mrs. Bush.

41:22.546 --> 41:33.691
And Karl Rove, who was essentially the genius of this administration, I suppose that they have him well programmed and they always tell him what to say and what to do.

41:35.976 --> 41:38.682
Well, but that is the sort of thing.

41:39.488 --> 41:43.812
that Kerry and Edwards should have said from the platform.

41:44.172 --> 41:46.995
And if they don't start saying it, they can forget it.

41:47.035 --> 41:47.955
They can kiss it off.

41:47.975 --> 41:48.696
It's all over.

41:48.716 --> 42:01.707
You know, I've asked Bill Clinton this, I've not met him and I don't expect to, but when he was leaving office three and a half or so years ago, he was asked, what one piece of advice would you give George W. Bush?

42:01.727 --> 42:03.389
It was very interesting.

42:03.409 --> 42:09.394
He said, I would advise him, I would urge him to read David Herbert Donald's biography of Abraham Lincoln.

42:10.117 --> 42:12.080
And I wonder what he meant by that.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.584
I'd love to know why that would be the one piece of advice.

42:15.624 --> 42:19.509
Number one, have him read a book, and he would have him read that book.

42:20.090 --> 42:38.593
I think I would, myself, never being an ex-president, nevertheless, would say this, and I wouldn't recommend that George W. Bush read anything, because by his own boast, some years back, he has never in his life actually finished the book, even at Yale.

42:38.994 --> 42:39.094
Yeah.

42:39.597 --> 42:41.659
And I think he's not Kimball at all anymore.

42:42.360 --> 42:53.633
I don't regard Clinton as a great intellectual judge of things.

42:53.653 --> 43:01.943
I would say that perhaps the best thing a president can read is Gore Vidal's best book, which is his...

43:02.834 --> 43:04.197
Yeah, interesting.

43:04.217 --> 43:06.160
Not more about Abraham Lincoln.

43:06.180 --> 43:06.581
Yeah, interesting.

43:06.741 --> 43:07.323
Interesting.

43:08.625 --> 43:12.753
I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I do have a couple more questions.

43:12.773 --> 43:13.935
No, no, no, no, no.

43:14.015 --> 43:15.218
We are well within time.

43:16.420 --> 43:17.963
You and my dear friends, Nick.

43:18.244 --> 43:24.235
I just so value your insight, and believe me, this will have a central point.

43:24.738 --> 43:27.121
place in this book that I'm working on.

43:27.341 --> 43:29.344
Let's go on.

43:29.364 --> 43:31.066
When I get tired, I'll tell you.

43:31.527 --> 43:31.727
Okay.

43:31.807 --> 43:40.118
You repeatedly mentioned that Virginia Woolf and her musings about the common reader.

43:40.138 --> 43:47.607
She takes that great phrase, as she says, from Johnson himself.

43:49.156 --> 43:49.937
Hello?

43:50.197 --> 43:53.281
It's Johnson's phrase, as you know.

43:53.341 --> 43:54.923
It's Johnson's phrase?

43:55.163 --> 43:55.243
Yes.

43:55.263 --> 44:05.195
And then you also would share... By the judgment of the common reader, he says, all questions of value and endurance finally will be settled down.

44:05.215 --> 44:07.537
That's not the exact wording, but it's something close to that.

44:07.978 --> 44:14.966
She picks that up and uses the title for her two series of rather excellent essays.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.868
But the Bloom Principles of Reading...

44:17.405 --> 44:21.511
basically do derive from Johnson, it seems to me.

44:21.771 --> 44:28.281
I would say, I love when you say you have to free yourself of Kent.

44:29.142 --> 44:35.131
One endless injunction of the great doctor was, clear yourself of Kent.

44:36.913 --> 44:43.142
And it's because one keeps shouting that.

44:43.375 --> 44:55.411
Indeed, my friend Hollander, to bring him in again, his critique of me, he says, Harold, there is no point ranting against Kant, but I can't help it.

44:55.591 --> 45:05.725
So is it hard when you sit down to read, to kind of clear yourself, to prepare yourself for the task at hand?

45:06.526 --> 45:09.210
It depends what one is reading these days.

45:10.231 --> 45:11.813
If I'm not reading, you know,

45:12.282 --> 45:20.993
scholarship or reactions to the New Testament.

45:21.013 --> 45:28.763
I find myself reading and rereading the Greek New Testament.

45:28.783 --> 45:33.589
What profound puzzlement I must admit.

45:33.609 --> 45:35.151
I find it a

45:36.160 --> 45:38.223
Extremely fascinating piece of work.

45:38.964 --> 45:40.666
Do you think I should talk with John Hollander?

45:40.766 --> 45:43.250
That might be pretty fascinating.

45:43.270 --> 45:47.295
Yeah, Uncle Hollander is one of the best literary minds alive.

45:48.277 --> 45:50.440
That would be kind of fun.

45:52.142 --> 45:56.648
He may by now also be a client, or at least partly a client of Glenn's.

45:56.808 --> 46:03.838
He is a man of formidable eloquence.

46:04.679 --> 46:05.960
a lens learning.

46:05.980 --> 46:09.524
He is far more learning in an organized way than I am.

46:12.207 --> 46:20.295
An extraordinarily feckled and gifted mind in every way.

46:20.315 --> 46:32.188
In one of your books, and of course I'm having all of them here, it's hard to remember which ones I'm drawing this from, but you say that our national epics are Moby Dick and Leaves of Grass.

46:32.438 --> 46:36.542
I don't know where I said it, but I think that's absolutely true, if someone were to say to me.

46:37.362 --> 46:48.212
Without the two great American books, I would, well, in terms of eminence, I would say Leaves of Grass, and I would say if it has any rival, it has to be Moby Dick.

46:49.113 --> 46:52.256
And you would call them our epics?

46:52.316 --> 47:00.623
Leaves of Grass, well, Song of Myself, the heart of the first Leaves of Grass, what eventually gets to be called Song of Myself,

47:01.126 --> 47:09.500
is in a way the national epic, but Leaves of Grass as a composite is certainly the national epic.

47:09.760 --> 47:14.868
A kind of dark anti-epic, as it were.

47:16.351 --> 47:20.377
Moby Dick.

47:20.738 --> 47:21.379
Hi, Gene.

47:22.321 --> 47:23.663
Okay.

47:23.783 --> 47:25.184
Hello, dear.

47:25.224 --> 47:26.686
I won't keep you too much.

47:26.946 --> 47:33.754
Again, I have the books, but I do... You were talking about that Leaves of Grass and Moby Dick.

47:33.795 --> 47:34.315
Exactly.

47:34.435 --> 47:35.857
There's the epics.

47:37.399 --> 47:40.122
I can't really think of a third one.

47:40.202 --> 47:45.368
I mean, there are eminent and powerful books by Americans.

47:46.469 --> 47:49.493
Huckleberry Finn is not epic, of course.

47:50.738 --> 47:54.924
No single work by Bothone or James could be called epical.

47:57.347 --> 48:02.915
Emerson really has to be read in the complete uncut journals.

48:02.935 --> 48:04.357
That's his great work.

48:05.759 --> 48:07.081
And it's hard to match that.

48:08.543 --> 48:13.631
You anoint him the American Goethe, too, which I find very interesting.

48:13.651 --> 48:14.231
Oh, yes, yes.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.414
I think he is the national sage.

48:17.376 --> 48:18.197
No sin.

48:18.953 --> 48:24.362
You know what, Harold, I'm going to let you go because this must get firing.

48:25.043 --> 48:26.986
Well, it's a great pleasure.

48:27.026 --> 48:29.831
We're actually at the point we had agreed on anyway.

48:29.871 --> 48:30.852
We've done 45 minutes.

48:31.133 --> 48:34.158
But I will look forward to reading your book, my dear.

48:34.178 --> 48:34.538
Thank you.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.099
Thank you.

48:35.119 --> 48:36.622
And thank you so much for everything.

48:36.722 --> 48:38.465
Nick, prosper, please.

48:38.485 --> 48:38.946
Thank you, sir.

48:38.986 --> 48:39.326
You too.

48:39.366 --> 48:40.468
Take good care of your health.

48:40.528 --> 48:41.790
Thank you, sir.

48:44.615 --> 48:44.775
Bye-bye.
