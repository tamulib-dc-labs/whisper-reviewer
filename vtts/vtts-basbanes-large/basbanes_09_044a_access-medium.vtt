WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:05.281
We're recording again.

00:05.421 --> 00:13.314
So we were picking up where you were reporting in Washington for the Post and tracing the evolution.

00:13.475 --> 00:17.942
Yeah, I thought that would be a perfect job for a writer.

00:17.962 --> 00:22.489
And in fact, I think it's the worst job for a writer.

00:22.529 --> 00:28.519
If you actually want to be doing writing while you're a reporter,

00:30.237 --> 00:31.498
you're probably not going to.

00:31.518 --> 00:37.744
I mean, you know, you're, as you know, a reporter's job is done when the story's done.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.306
It's not like you've got a nine-to-five job or something.

00:40.346 --> 00:45.651
I'd go home exhausted at night, and the last thing in the world I wanted to do was sit down and write something.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.952
That's why I quit the newspaper.

00:47.512 --> 00:47.852
Yeah.

00:47.892 --> 00:48.793
It's tough.

00:48.813 --> 00:49.314
You can't do it.

00:49.334 --> 00:49.794
It's tough.

00:49.834 --> 00:50.375
You can't do it.

00:50.395 --> 00:59.923
I realized that after about four or five months, but I had been such a lousy reporter anyway that they were happy to see me go, I think, and I

01:00.562 --> 01:01.423
quite happy to leave.

01:01.483 --> 01:07.771
I went out to San Francisco, got a job as a waiter, and that was a perfect job for me.

01:07.872 --> 01:09.393
I was able to... What restaurant?

01:10.174 --> 01:12.377
Oh, I worked at the Hilton.

01:12.698 --> 01:19.647
I worked at a restaurant in the Tenderloin, Lair's, Lair's Restaurant.

01:19.667 --> 01:23.832
I kept getting, I was not a very good waiter, so I kept getting fired, but it was always easy to get another job.

01:23.912 --> 01:27.097
My ship was out of Alameda, so I spent a lot of time.

01:27.117 --> 01:27.377
You did?

01:27.397 --> 01:27.497
Yeah.

01:28.658 --> 01:50.889
Anyway, it was good money, and I had my days free, so I'd write, and I taught high school for a little while out there as well, but mainly, you know, I really concentrated on the writing, working mainly on short stories, and I wrote it.

01:51.010 --> 01:56.337
I finished one of the novels that I'd been working on in Oxford, and I

01:56.755 --> 01:59.438
And then I got really interested in writing short stories.

02:00.019 --> 02:07.927
And finally in, you know, 75, I had one that I really thought was a good story.

02:08.368 --> 02:13.133
And I hadn't sent any of them out before because I knew they just weren't there.

02:13.173 --> 02:14.755
But this story really felt good to me.

02:15.475 --> 02:16.116
So I sent it out.

02:16.156 --> 02:17.017
I was very lucky.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.579
It was taken by The Atlantic.

02:19.159 --> 02:24.105
And really, since then, I had good luck with getting my story.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.126
It was called Smokers.

02:25.766 --> 02:26.307
And...

02:26.675 --> 02:29.157
It was in my first collection.

02:29.177 --> 02:30.639
And I had... Which was published when?

02:30.659 --> 02:32.300
I think they put the dates in here.

02:32.320 --> 02:32.440
81.

02:32.781 --> 02:33.041
Okay.

02:34.582 --> 02:35.103
80 or 81.

02:35.123 --> 02:35.323
80.

02:36.104 --> 02:38.706
So it took eight years, really.

02:38.726 --> 02:38.926
81.

02:38.946 --> 02:39.347
81.

02:40.147 --> 02:40.588
Oh, yeah.

02:40.868 --> 02:41.108
Oh, yeah.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.069
It took a long time.

02:43.030 --> 02:43.991
A lot of false starts?

02:44.011 --> 02:45.232
A lot of false starts.

02:45.552 --> 02:46.573
Many rejections?

02:46.593 --> 02:46.914
Oh, yeah.

02:47.494 --> 02:48.135
Oh, yeah.

02:48.195 --> 02:48.715
The novel.

02:48.735 --> 02:49.096
Oh, yeah.

02:49.116 --> 02:52.579
The novels I couldn't have any luck with.

02:52.599 --> 02:53.299
Couldn't get arrested.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.142
Which is good, again, because

02:57.353 --> 03:04.280
How many novels, approximately?

03:04.300 --> 03:11.507
Well, I wrote three novels.

03:15.090 --> 03:17.653
I didn't see a lot of tapes running.

03:17.673 --> 03:19.735
You know, tell me.

03:19.755 --> 03:20.035
Okay.

03:20.095 --> 03:20.315
Call me.

03:20.335 --> 03:22.357
I'm not sending this in for two or three weeks.

03:22.478 --> 03:24.019
Okay.

03:25.957 --> 03:28.600
What kind of document in your life is right here?

03:28.881 --> 03:32.445
Well, anyway, I guess you can say that in P.W.

03:32.485 --> 03:32.886
Why not?

03:33.627 --> 03:35.349
I had one of the novels taken in England.

03:36.190 --> 03:37.391
By which publisher?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.193
Allen and Unwin.

03:39.434 --> 03:40.655
L-A-L-O-E-N-N-U-N-W-I-N.

03:41.056 --> 03:42.377
What was its title?

03:44.060 --> 03:45.862
I think we'll just leave it at that.

03:45.902 --> 03:47.744
Why don't we just say I had a novel published in England?

03:47.924 --> 03:49.566
That's Tobias Wolfe?

03:49.586 --> 03:50.948
Yeah.

03:50.968 --> 03:52.570
I mean, it's not going to be that hard to find out.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.331
Yeah, I know.

03:53.969 --> 03:54.370
I know.

03:54.590 --> 03:55.912
And it's just my business.

03:55.932 --> 03:56.172
Yeah.

03:56.572 --> 03:58.315
It's so bad, though.

03:58.555 --> 03:59.596
It's so bad.

03:59.616 --> 04:00.417
I can't, you know.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.200
Actually, you know, I think we'll just leave it.

04:02.220 --> 04:03.942
I'll just say I wrote the office.

04:03.962 --> 04:04.723
That's the important thing.

04:05.384 --> 04:06.926
And it didn't do anything.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.988
But why is it bothering you?

04:09.008 --> 04:10.090
I don't want anybody to read it.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.532
I mean, it's just so bad.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.593
It's embarrassing to me.

04:12.613 --> 04:14.115
But you sound like Tim O'Brien now.

04:14.175 --> 04:15.377
Would you go back and read it?

04:15.397 --> 04:16.738
No, it's not good enough to revise.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.124
It's clearly an editor in England, but it was good enough to publish.

04:21.244 --> 04:21.484
Yeah.

04:21.825 --> 04:23.307
A reputable publishing house.

04:23.327 --> 04:23.487
Yeah.

04:23.737 --> 04:24.418
You know, died?

04:24.758 --> 04:25.539
Yeah, died.

04:25.559 --> 04:26.600
Yeah, died, absolutely.

04:26.661 --> 04:27.221
Blessedly?

04:27.442 --> 04:28.583
Blessedly, yeah.

04:28.603 --> 04:29.384
Can we say that?

04:30.205 --> 04:31.426
Uh, yeah, you can say that.

04:31.607 --> 04:33.289
Died blessedly.

04:33.309 --> 04:34.650
And this was by 80, 81?

04:34.690 --> 04:35.892
No, this would have been 75.

04:36.392 --> 04:38.054
Well, what's wrong with it?

04:38.074 --> 04:39.376
You were a kid, for God's sake.

04:39.456 --> 04:40.277
How old were you?

04:40.297 --> 04:41.439
20, 20-odd?

04:41.819 --> 04:43.201
No, I was by then 30.

04:43.221 --> 04:43.661
30?

04:43.821 --> 04:44.662
Well, I was published.

04:46.765 --> 04:49.368
Well, anyway, I, I... You're nervous.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.229
Yeah, I don't like it.

04:50.289 --> 04:51.291
It's embarrassing to me.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.512
Anyway, the, uh,

04:53.673 --> 04:54.655
I mean, I wrote it in my toilet.

04:54.715 --> 04:55.836
I'll go over this with you.

04:55.896 --> 04:56.878
Okay.

04:56.958 --> 04:57.319
All right.

04:57.339 --> 04:57.980
Yeah, go over it.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.208
I promise you that I'll call and we'll go over it.

05:03.228 --> 05:12.783
But anyway, it had at least the virtue of making me feel like somebody else in the world besides me thought I was a writer.

05:13.684 --> 05:16.609
And, you know, once you've got a book out there with your name on it,

05:17.180 --> 05:18.201
It kind of encouraged you.

05:18.281 --> 05:20.043
Did it have a nice dust jacket?

05:20.103 --> 05:21.865
No, it had a hideous dust jacket.

05:22.266 --> 05:23.307
It was a hardcover book.

05:23.467 --> 05:23.968
Hardcover book.

05:23.988 --> 05:25.529
Were you elated for a while?

05:25.549 --> 05:26.110
Oh, yeah.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.231
How long were you happy?

05:28.533 --> 05:31.376
Well, at what point did you... I don't remember how long I was happy.

05:31.476 --> 05:37.103
At what point did you discover that you were embarrassed by this thing?

05:37.123 --> 05:40.767
Oh, probably three or four years later when I started rereading it.

05:40.787 --> 05:42.689
I thought, my God, did I really think this was good?

05:42.749 --> 05:43.790
Did you use another run for it?

05:43.810 --> 05:44.891
No, no, no.

05:44.931 --> 05:45.432
It was just...

05:46.627 --> 05:47.849
Flawed to the root.

05:47.869 --> 05:48.591
Juvenalia?

05:48.651 --> 05:49.332
Juvenalia.

05:49.553 --> 05:50.214
Juvenalia.

05:50.835 --> 05:53.039
Most people's juvenalia doesn't get published.

05:53.661 --> 05:54.462
Full bear.

05:55.544 --> 05:56.426
But mine did.

05:57.328 --> 05:58.410
That's a quote, by the way.

05:59.252 --> 06:03.981
If we say it, we'll... Good.

06:04.001 --> 06:04.402
Yeah.

06:04.422 --> 06:04.522
Okay.

06:04.542 --> 06:04.943
So let's continue.

06:04.963 --> 06:06.205
But at least, I mean...

06:06.337 --> 06:09.462
In some ways, I'm glad for it, because it did buoy me up.

06:09.562 --> 06:14.549
I mean, it reminded me that I wasn't just a waiter, but I was a waiter who wrote books that other people might even publish.

06:14.589 --> 06:14.930
Right.

06:15.651 --> 06:20.338
But did it also sour you on a novel form?

06:20.679 --> 06:21.300
No, no, no.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.742
That you moved over to the short stories?

06:22.862 --> 06:24.224
No, that wasn't it really.

06:24.324 --> 06:27.609
I just got, I was, I started reading a lot of short stories.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.233
I really got captivated by the form.

06:30.253 --> 06:31.335
I really liked the form.

06:31.635 --> 06:35.601
And so I started writing short stories, and I just found it very, uh,

06:36.931 --> 06:41.357
better suited for my particular gifts at that point, anyway.

06:41.497 --> 06:45.403
And what captivated you specifically about the form?

06:45.423 --> 06:48.327
What really captured you?

06:48.367 --> 06:51.551
What was it in the short story that...?

06:51.571 --> 06:52.212
The power.

06:57.259 --> 07:00.684
The directness.

07:00.704 --> 07:02.326
The immediacy.

07:03.728 --> 07:06.752
It was the same thing I liked about poetry.

07:07.508 --> 07:24.169
the unity of impression that a short story could make on you, the ability to conjure up a world in a few pages and get something going indelibly in the reader's mind and then leave it to continue to grow afterwards.

07:24.189 --> 07:25.971
The novel has a kind of completeness about it.

07:25.991 --> 07:27.793
It finishes itself.

07:27.833 --> 07:32.559
The story suggests, implies, gets something going almost at its best.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.542
And I really liked that.

07:34.562 --> 07:37.245
I found it exciting, and I started reading a lot of short stories.

07:37.664 --> 07:55.589
short stories that started writing them myself, and I found, perhaps because of the life I'd led, very nomadic and very fragmentary, maybe there was something in my own experience that lent itself to an appreciation of the story, which has a very momentary nature, I think.

07:56.610 --> 08:06.844
It doesn't... The novel implies a kind of stability, a kind of... a steady...

08:08.360 --> 08:14.929
fund of experience, a certain place in which one stays for a while.

08:15.049 --> 08:19.636
At the bottom of the novel, there's a sense of continuity.

08:21.078 --> 08:23.161
And that's not true of the short stories.

08:23.221 --> 08:27.627
The short stories are very immediate, very direct, kind of breaks on you, and it's gone.

08:28.248 --> 08:29.329
Maybe about a single night.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.494
Of course, Ulysses is almost about a single night.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.857
You could say that about a novel as well.

08:35.039 --> 08:39.044
Generally speaking, I think it's truer of the story than the novel.

08:39.865 --> 08:42.128
And I don't know what it is.

08:42.148 --> 08:43.750
It just really took me by storm.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.993
And for years, I wrote nothing but short stories.

08:46.053 --> 08:49.318
And, you know, they didn't come easy.

08:49.358 --> 08:53.503
I've always had to work very hard and rewrite a lot at everything I do.

08:53.543 --> 08:57.689
But I felt very much more in control of what I was doing.

08:58.229 --> 09:02.515
I felt a kind of authority in my use of the form that I had.

09:02.697 --> 09:04.319
had never quite felt with the novel.

09:04.479 --> 09:09.545
I'd always felt a little kind of bled by the form rather than leading it.

09:09.565 --> 09:13.550
With the story, I felt more, you know, like I was at home.

09:14.551 --> 09:24.864
You mentioned in this vintage book on the short stories, the anthology that you edited, you said that you had the perfect stranger in mind when you compiled it.

09:25.925 --> 09:31.472
And I'm just wondering if you had the perfect stranger in mind when you were writing the memoirs.

09:33.595 --> 09:40.621
trying to bring up both the stories and the memoirs.

09:40.641 --> 09:40.741
Yeah.

09:40.761 --> 09:46.286
It's a philosophic question, I guess, on the audience.

09:46.306 --> 09:54.012
The question of audience is always a tricky one.

09:54.032 --> 10:02.860
I suppose in the end, no matter what they say, writers write for a reader like themselves because

10:04.004 --> 10:07.047
Who else could you imagine writing for?

10:07.067 --> 10:19.601
I mean, I say stranger, but at the same time, I suppose there's also... You say stranger in compiling the anthology, though.

10:19.621 --> 10:23.264
Well, what I said was, yeah, in compiling the anthology.

10:24.646 --> 10:25.927
But who is that stranger?

10:25.987 --> 10:31.473
In a way, I'm imagining a stranger like myself, with my tastes.

10:31.493 --> 10:33.235
I mean, how could I say, well...

10:34.075 --> 10:40.282
This person who's a stranger to me must have such and such a taste, and this is the... So these are the stories I'm going to give him.

10:41.123 --> 10:41.844
That's absurd.

10:43.045 --> 10:45.448
Whenever we do... I mean, I do say that.

10:45.628 --> 10:47.150
I admit I said that.

10:47.390 --> 10:54.518
But at the same time, there's no question at all that I'm projecting my taste onto that stranger, you know.

10:54.939 --> 10:58.203
And so, in the end, the question comes back around.

10:59.684 --> 11:03.829
I'm hoping that readers will enjoy the things I enjoy.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.314
Can I tell you a cute story?

11:06.674 --> 11:12.161
I did an interview two weeks ago with Alexander Theroux on his book, The Primary Colors, which is delightful.

11:12.181 --> 11:14.103
We have the same editor at home.

11:15.084 --> 11:29.161
And so, I don't know how we got on to this, but Alex quoted Nabokov, who was once asked who he writes for, and he said, when I write, I look out and I see the faces of 100 Nabokov's faces.

11:29.181 --> 11:29.682
Wonderful.

11:30.910 --> 11:31.511
Wonderful.

11:31.871 --> 11:35.476
Because I see the face of the 100 little, the poker house.

11:35.496 --> 11:36.137
There you go.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.600
Exactly.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.783
And I guess that's precisely what you're saying.

11:41.724 --> 11:45.449
It also means, I mean, this isn't just solipsism.

11:45.589 --> 11:50.035
It is also a way of being, of holding yourself responsible.

11:50.095 --> 11:58.506
That is, I don't ever condescend to my readers because I think I wouldn't be fooled by that.

11:59.468 --> 11:59.668
You know?

12:00.323 --> 12:21.669
So in a sense, my own, you know, I imagine a reader when I'm writing or collecting an anthology, putting an anthology together who is as sophisticated as I am, who asks as much, who has as critical intelligence as mine, because anything else would be condescension.

12:22.650 --> 12:28.137
You know, if I say, well, I wouldn't really, this wouldn't pass muster with me, but

12:29.602 --> 12:31.264
Most people won't notice, you know.

12:31.324 --> 12:34.366
Well, that's how you write badly, by doing that.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.408
You have to hold yourself to the highest standard.

12:37.009 --> 12:43.535
And how can you imagine a standard higher than the standards that you hold for yourself, you know?

12:43.795 --> 12:50.001
When I read another novelist, I hold them to a high standard.

12:50.922 --> 12:56.807
And it would be insanity of me to hold myself to a lesser standard, because then

12:58.238 --> 13:03.005
The very people that I would like to have like my work won't like it.

13:05.148 --> 13:14.181
So the question of who you write for inevitably comes back to yourself.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.543
Do you have vital signs?

13:15.623 --> 13:22.192
I know that by writing for newspapers, at least you technically... I love this introduction, by the way, to the writing.

13:22.212 --> 13:22.573
Oh, good.

13:23.975 --> 13:24.836
I mean, I'll use it.

13:25.897 --> 13:27.840
I can see it in any number of...

13:28.242 --> 13:31.487
other instances down the road.

13:31.527 --> 13:34.691
A good buddy of mine is a writer, but also a musician.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.196
And he said, writing is so much harder.

13:38.317 --> 13:46.268
He said, when you get up and you do a jazz thing on the stage, he said that the response is instantaneous.

13:46.909 --> 13:53.238
I mean, if you're connecting with the audience, you get your gratification immediately.

13:53.358 --> 13:54.340
Yeah, it's true.

13:54.380 --> 13:57.625
But writing is, you do this thing for years.

13:57.785 --> 13:57.945
Yeah.

13:58.516 --> 14:03.481
I mean, and you do with the knowledge that this thing is not going to be done for a long time.

14:03.741 --> 14:06.924
You know, hopefully you'll live long enough to see the thing.

14:07.045 --> 14:07.425
Exactly.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.027
But you can't be sure you won't.

14:09.107 --> 14:10.408
And I guess you can't.

14:10.728 --> 14:13.671
You know, my concern is I just want this book out.

14:13.711 --> 14:15.934
You know, will I get the footnotes done in time?

14:15.954 --> 14:17.996
Will I get all the corrections in?

14:18.016 --> 14:19.437
You know, that kind of stuff.

14:21.079 --> 14:27.325
I don't know if that's a question of anything, but where was I going with that?

14:28.587 --> 14:37.938
I guess I'm really interested in your own perception of your development as a writer.

14:37.958 --> 14:46.328
I mean, you discussed the novel that now embarrasses you to discuss.

14:46.348 --> 14:49.752
I'm certain that you wouldn't feel that way about this boy's life.

14:49.852 --> 14:50.352
No, I don't.

14:50.593 --> 14:51.073
I don't.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.275
In fact, I don't feel that way.

14:52.295 --> 14:54.858
And that was by example, you know, of anything that you've written.

14:54.898 --> 14:57.801
The stuff that I've published since.

14:58.085 --> 14:58.586
I mean, that's important.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.909
I've been very, I've been, you know.

15:01.089 --> 15:09.582
Because you made a comment earlier about completed work, being completed work, and representing what you did at that time in your life.

15:10.003 --> 15:10.243
Right.

15:10.403 --> 15:18.956
So maybe you can bring these things together here at this point, and then also related to how you're developing and what you see coming, you know.

15:18.976 --> 15:19.617
Right.

15:20.057 --> 15:26.607
No, I see the work beginning with that first published story.

15:27.110 --> 15:52.577
as being mature work and work that i'm happy to take responsibility for and claim credit for even uh since then and you know it's not all perfect i can see things that or it doesn't seem perfect to me now though it seemed as perfect as i could make it at the time i let it go i can see things that uh now that uh i might wish i had done differently but but

15:53.873 --> 15:58.058
Maybe everything else would have been done differently if I had done that at the time.

15:58.219 --> 16:06.910
So, you know, it's like, you know, it's the old business of upgrading your stereo, you know.

16:06.970 --> 16:12.076
Once you buy the new speakers, then you have to buy the new amp because you need more watts per channel.

16:12.196 --> 16:12.837
You know what I mean?

16:12.897 --> 16:18.825
And the thing belongs on its, it has its own little world that it inhabits.

16:18.965 --> 16:19.746
It has its own,

16:20.266 --> 16:49.159
terms on which it's successful and you start monkeying with those terms you throw everything else out of whack i think uh where do i see uh it's going i have a collection of stories that i've been working on over the last oh god six or seven years that is uh actually very close to completion that will probably come out in about a year or a year and a half i my last book came out about six years ago this boy's life

16:49.713 --> 17:12.598
and uh that was the last that was the last book prior to this one yeah so your published fiction really has been just short stories here and there since then i published nothing out of in pharaoh's army because they didn't want to send out parts of it uh until it was done and then i have just you know i have like three pieces coming out in different places uh this is short fiction

17:13.270 --> 17:16.013
No, this is three pieces from this.

17:16.033 --> 17:26.346
Yeah, Esquire's going to publish a piece, and the Three Penny Review published a piece, and Esquire in England is publishing a piece.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.649
Did you make the selections, or did they make the selections?

17:29.770 --> 17:32.493
They made the selections.

17:32.633 --> 17:41.083
That was fine, but I wanted to wait until I got the book all done, because I had, unlike a collection of short stories, but you send out the story as you finish it,

17:41.620 --> 18:11.239
the parts of this book were so interdependent that i had to make sure that it was really as i did a lot of rewriting on this book a lot of rewriting and literary work well i certainly intended it that way and i worked very hard on it and and i wanted to uh make sure you do see it as a literary work oh yes oh yeah absolutely i wouldn't have taken so much time with it otherwise um

18:12.097 --> 18:20.266
That's my satisfaction in the whole process is to think that I have made a literary work finally.

18:20.826 --> 18:24.690
It's more than the telling of the events.

18:24.710 --> 18:26.712
Yeah, I have to have a certain... In this boy's life.

18:26.813 --> 18:28.274
Yeah, when they're told, they're told.

18:28.294 --> 18:33.339
But what remains is a sense of, what can I say, aesthetic pride.

18:35.722 --> 18:41.428
So even though you haven't published fiction between hardcovers in how long now?

18:43.400 --> 19:11.500
ten years nine years does this disturb you at all no not at all yeah i've published a lot of fiction since then magazines and journals uh i've made a lot of stories and uh several of those stories have been in best american short stories and whatnot and i've certainly kept alive as a fiction writer and as i say i'm very close to finishing this collection of stories

19:12.104 --> 19:13.806
one or two stories short of a collection.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.429
Is there a cohesiveness on a collection?

19:15.449 --> 19:16.870
Should there be, in your view?

19:17.952 --> 19:19.073
Yeah, I do.

19:19.294 --> 19:20.736
Yeah, I do.

19:20.996 --> 19:25.462
I think that the readers of this collection will find a coherence to it.

19:25.482 --> 19:26.083
Thematically?

19:27.124 --> 19:33.393
Thematically, and the tone, the feeling, the atmosphere of the stories.

19:33.493 --> 19:40.002
I would hope that the reader would recognize my work from one story to the next and feel a certain

19:41.568 --> 19:48.078
quality of moral attention on particularly the domestic life in these stories.

19:49.420 --> 19:55.489
You know, a quote, and again, it's a wonderful quote, family life has always been great theater and always will be, like war.

19:55.609 --> 19:59.495
I mean, that's from theater, but I couldn't lie certainly to just about everything.

19:59.855 --> 20:00.957
Yeah, it does.

20:00.977 --> 20:01.378
You bet.

20:02.499 --> 20:09.309
And if there is a continuity in what you've written, would you say that it is the family life, the domestic?

20:09.329 --> 20:09.970
Yes.

20:09.990 --> 20:11.052
The areas that

20:11.723 --> 20:20.976
Yeah, that's the battleground on which most of us fight our wars, I think, and have our victories and our losses.

20:22.238 --> 20:26.644
Are there mysteries to you that you try to solve, or is the storytelling?

20:26.664 --> 20:28.747
There are mysteries that I try to delineate.

20:28.787 --> 20:31.531
There are mysteries that I try to recognize.

20:31.972 --> 20:36.178
I am incapable of solving them.

20:36.783 --> 20:37.524
Don't try.

20:37.684 --> 21:06.165
I'm very much of the Chekhovian school there, which, you know, when Suverin was badgering him about, you know, tying up his stories a little more deeply, and he said that wonderful quote about it is that it is not the responsibility of the writer to answer questions only to pose them, and I think that's

21:06.972 --> 21:07.893
I think that's true.

21:10.916 --> 21:19.706
Do you see everything that you're doing as part of a corpus that they all fit together?

21:19.726 --> 21:29.877
Well, what I hope is that readers one day will look back and see them as all part of a whole.

21:30.738 --> 21:32.319
But I can't see them that way myself.

21:33.441 --> 21:34.802
I think that it would be

21:35.643 --> 21:40.248
I'm not writing a series of novels about Yachna-Patofa County, right?

21:40.268 --> 21:42.871
I mean, there's not... It doesn't have that coherence.

21:42.891 --> 21:59.751
But I think there are elements in the fiction and in Dispoised Life that will be seen, perhaps, I hope, as characteristic of my work and definitive of my work.

22:00.732 --> 22:03.355
And as time goes on,

22:04.769 --> 22:08.755
You know, those elements will probably become more pronounced, I hope more elaborate.

22:09.636 --> 22:12.821
You know, I hope it will grow like a tree, really.

22:13.161 --> 22:21.433
Where you did leave such a peripatetic life, is place, as a consequence, important to you in your writing?

22:21.453 --> 22:21.733
Yes.

22:22.054 --> 22:22.635
Yeah, it is.

22:22.935 --> 22:25.579
You know, everything happens somewhere.

22:26.757 --> 22:34.928
And... But you said there's no... You have to put out for a county either, I mean... Well, no, not in that... I know the sense you're talking about.

22:34.948 --> 22:40.595
I mean, it's more than the four corners of the yard in Aroma County, but a state of mind.

22:40.635 --> 22:47.244
But also, I think that, you know, I'm talking specifically about setting here.

22:47.264 --> 22:53.612
There's nothing that you feel... I mean, you have no... You're not bound to any... To any boundaries, I guess.

22:53.713 --> 22:54.754
Not really, no.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.376
Physical boundaries.

22:57.638 --> 22:58.779
No, I think not.

23:03.104 --> 23:08.070
I did have a question, and I guess I think I asked it, and maybe you answered it.

23:10.032 --> 23:20.203
At what point did you realize that you were a writer, that you could bring the heat in, as the pictures say, I mean, that you could bring it, you know, that you could play in this ballpark?

23:36.822 --> 23:40.687
Well, I'm just trying to think.

23:40.707 --> 23:41.929
I mean, there are different times.

23:41.949 --> 23:44.693
There's not any one moment for me that I can identify.

23:44.733 --> 23:48.878
There are series of moments.

23:48.918 --> 23:53.985
There's a moment when... You know, there's one, really, and it's a very odd one.

23:56.268 --> 24:04.139
This is before any contact with my brother or that teacher in school or any kind of success as a writer at all.

24:04.179 --> 24:06.542
But when I was...

24:07.147 --> 24:18.324
Still in Concrete High School, I used to write short stories for friends of mine and for people who wanted to hand them in, you know, for their, I'd write essays and stories for friends of mine.

24:18.344 --> 24:22.570
And because I was just writing all, I wrote a lot.

24:23.211 --> 24:33.766
And a friend of mine, who was then my age, 14 or so, just another rube like me, said to me one day, you know, you ought to be a writer.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.951
And I asked something, but it never occurred

24:37.403 --> 24:39.627
Isn't that odd?

24:40.368 --> 24:56.193
I mean, I wrote and I read all the time, but the idea that I could be someone who wrote things that other people read, not just for the entertainment of my friends or for getting extra credit in school, but actually have never really occurred to me before.

24:56.894 --> 25:00.620
And it's funny that this kid didn't know anything about what it had to be a writer.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.803
He knew less than I did about it.

25:03.374 --> 25:16.474
Those words took root in me somehow and gave me some kind of center around which the rest of me could coalesce and see life.

25:16.975 --> 25:23.686
And it was then, really, that I began to start thinking of myself as someone who might be a writer.

25:23.746 --> 25:26.370
And when that happens to you, you start seeing things differently.

25:27.552 --> 25:30.917
Your approach to the world becomes a different approach.

25:31.505 --> 25:36.491
The way you organize your experience becomes different than it was before.

25:36.531 --> 25:47.545
So that boy whose name I don't even remember now, but who's, it was genius.

25:47.805 --> 25:50.428
It doesn't matter, but you know, I had the strangest experience.

25:52.171 --> 25:53.712
I was up in Alaska this spring.

25:54.213 --> 25:57.377
I was giving a reading, and

25:58.707 --> 26:04.034
This young woman came up to me after the reading and said, had a book for me to sign, and then talked.

26:04.054 --> 26:10.802
And just as she was about to leave, she said, you know, you won't remember him, she said, that my father went to Concrete High School with you.

26:11.883 --> 26:13.425
And I said, oh, really, what was his name?

26:13.485 --> 26:16.509
And she told me his name, and that was the boy.

26:16.529 --> 26:19.012
I told her that story, too.

26:19.032 --> 26:19.112
Wow.

26:20.054 --> 26:32.288
It was a funny moment, I mean, and all the other stuff was of infinite importance, and nothing could have happened without it, but that needed to happen first.

26:33.409 --> 26:36.273
I mean, you said that you had a lot of rejections.

26:36.293 --> 26:36.653
Oh, yeah.

26:37.033 --> 26:41.559
I mean, you didn't say, well, maybe I should be doing something else.

26:42.099 --> 26:44.302
Yeah, I did sometimes, but I couldn't.

26:45.203 --> 26:47.145
I couldn't do anything else.

26:47.165 --> 26:48.947
I mean, I couldn't.

26:49.822 --> 26:53.728
I couldn't both in the sense that I didn't know how.

26:55.010 --> 26:55.871
I mean, I could be a teacher.

26:56.632 --> 26:57.633
I've been a teacher.

26:58.034 --> 26:58.995
I like teaching.

26:59.015 --> 27:00.838
I want to talk briefly about that at some point.

27:00.958 --> 27:04.263
I like teaching, but it never would have been enough for me.

27:04.924 --> 27:13.596
And though it's enough, it would have been a lot easier for me if it had been enough for me because trying to do both for years and years was very hard.

27:16.340 --> 27:19.525
But I just need to write.

27:20.197 --> 27:21.679
You know, it's funny.

27:21.699 --> 27:24.664
When I finished this book, it took me a long time to write this book.

27:24.684 --> 27:24.924
How long?

27:25.905 --> 27:30.873
I started work on it a year after This Boy's Life came out, so I worked on this book.

27:30.893 --> 27:34.398
I just finished doing the last Touch on the Galleys two days ago.

27:35.199 --> 27:35.680
Okay?

27:35.900 --> 27:36.301
No kidding.

27:37.042 --> 27:38.544
So there are changes from what I've read?

27:38.584 --> 27:41.528
Nothing significant.

27:41.688 --> 27:43.171
I mean, they're significant to me.

27:43.711 --> 27:46.055
I don't even know if you'd notice them.

27:46.075 --> 27:47.377
They're word changes, mostly.

27:48.739 --> 27:49.680
Housekeeping, I didn't.

27:50.369 --> 27:54.375
things that just tone it up, repetitions that I caught that I didn't want.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.056
You know what I mean?

27:55.517 --> 27:56.699
I hate those repetitions.

27:56.719 --> 28:00.585
Oh, I hate, I just feel so careless when something shows up again, you know?

28:01.707 --> 28:02.969
I think I caught them all.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.111
I hate the same word twice.

28:04.131 --> 28:04.551
I do, too.

28:04.632 --> 28:09.659
I don't, I mean, I, really, I just won't, if I can help it, I won't do it.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.542
And so I caught a lot of that stuff.

28:11.623 --> 28:12.584
And I mean, in the whole book.

28:13.005 --> 28:14.487
Yeah, I'm talking the same way.

28:15.228 --> 28:16.090
I'm talking the same way.

28:16.110 --> 28:17.592
I don't write a chapter, I mean, if I,

28:18.736 --> 28:37.956
I knowledgeably used, knowingly used, one rather peculiar word at the beginning of the book and again at the end, and I allowed myself that, because it was not a word that there was any equivalent for, and it was absolutely essential in both places, the word fetishized.

28:37.976 --> 28:44.083
And it's a peculiar word, and I know people will notice it, but there is no other word.

28:44.183 --> 28:46.245
I remember, but I still recall...

28:46.833 --> 28:47.935
The first use of it?

28:47.995 --> 28:48.595
Yeah.

28:48.836 --> 28:50.078
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

28:50.098 --> 28:53.422
It doesn't matter, because I usually pick these things up.

28:53.442 --> 28:56.507
Yeah, but there were other repetitions in there that I got rid of.

28:56.547 --> 28:58.910
Every other one that I could find, I got rid of.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.773
Did you use a computer for that?

29:00.793 --> 29:01.634
No, I couldn't.

29:01.834 --> 29:02.976
You had to do a search.

29:03.336 --> 29:04.858
I know, I know.

29:05.018 --> 29:16.114
But the problem was that I had started off on that dinosaur at IBM, and then I went to another computer, and I didn't know how to... Anyway.

29:16.702 --> 29:18.064
No, I didn't do that.

29:20.907 --> 29:21.888
What was I talking about?

29:22.349 --> 29:22.969
That's okay.

29:23.130 --> 29:25.152
We were talking about when you discovered it.

29:25.292 --> 29:27.275
Let me ask another question.

29:27.295 --> 29:33.942
Any editors that you've worked with that have been a particular usefulness to you?

29:34.864 --> 29:35.404
You know what?

29:35.484 --> 29:42.793
I'll tell you, Nick, I don't want to do that because I always recognize the editors

29:45.254 --> 29:48.039
In whatever way I can when I'm working for them.

29:48.079 --> 29:51.426
But if I, first of all, if I name them all now, that will sound ridiculous.

29:51.566 --> 29:55.233
And if I leave one of them out, they'll be so hurt.

29:55.374 --> 29:57.217
Anyone I would leave out would be so hurt.

29:57.438 --> 29:58.540
I couldn't do it.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.267
There isn't any one particular additive then.

30:02.517 --> 30:03.818
I'm not going to name any.

30:03.898 --> 30:06.661
That you've worked with throughout your career, I think, is what you're saying.

30:06.682 --> 30:07.623
You've worked with a variety.

30:07.703 --> 30:08.063
Yeah.

30:08.083 --> 30:08.844
A number of editors.

30:08.864 --> 30:09.244
That's right.

30:09.324 --> 30:10.285
They've all been good.

30:10.365 --> 30:18.334
And no single one has had this overwhelming impact in development as a writer that you can think of.

30:18.354 --> 30:19.135
How about an agent?

30:19.215 --> 30:20.977
Is there anything peculiar?

30:21.137 --> 30:23.119
I think I'll just, if you don't mind.

30:23.139 --> 30:23.780
I think you did.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.543
I think editors and agents, I think I'll just leave all that out.

30:26.563 --> 30:26.983
Okay.

30:27.003 --> 30:28.966
Okay?

30:29.146 --> 30:31.208
It's not particularly significant in any way to

30:31.458 --> 30:32.940
How about publishing houses?

30:33.140 --> 30:37.086
Have you moved around from... Yeah, I've moved around from house to house a lot.

30:37.106 --> 30:38.668
This will be my first book with Knopf.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.753
I've published almost every book with a different house.

30:42.793 --> 30:44.075
Oh, I see.

30:44.596 --> 30:45.137
Okay.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.701
Yeah, I started off... I'll be glad to show you the P.W.

30:48.741 --> 30:49.863
question list at some point.

30:49.883 --> 30:50.604
Yeah, that's all right.

30:50.624 --> 30:51.585
It's kind of funny.

30:51.665 --> 30:52.507
It's good, actually.

30:52.667 --> 30:58.054
I started off with... This is stuff I'd never ask.

30:58.194 --> 31:00.958
I just punch it up on a Harvard University computer.

31:01.563 --> 31:02.924
Go ahead.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.366
I'm just going to look at this thing.

31:04.386 --> 31:07.349
I started off with the Echo Press.

31:07.969 --> 31:10.032
They did my first two books.

31:11.233 --> 31:16.818
And then I did a book with Houghton Mifflin, and then I did a book with the Atlantic Monthly Press.

31:17.079 --> 31:18.961
Which one was Houghton?

31:18.981 --> 31:21.083
It was a book, a short story is called Back in the World.

31:21.283 --> 31:22.724
Okay.

31:23.705 --> 31:28.330
And then This Boy's Life came out with Atlantic Monthly Press, and then Knopf is going to do my next two books.

31:29.390 --> 31:32.653
And I've had different paperback publishers.

31:32.733 --> 31:34.235
Oh, that's all right.

31:34.295 --> 31:37.158
But you do have a multi-book contract with Cobb?

31:37.478 --> 31:38.999
Yes, for this book and the next one.

31:39.019 --> 31:40.621
Okay, and the next one is the stories.

31:40.701 --> 31:41.021
Yeah.

31:41.041 --> 31:42.663
Do you have a title for the stories?

31:43.224 --> 31:44.285
No, not yet.

31:44.305 --> 31:48.048
Are you projecting any kind of pub date on it, publishing year?

31:48.349 --> 31:51.912
I think they're hoping that it will come out in a year.

31:52.573 --> 31:54.254
Okay, a year from fall.

31:54.415 --> 31:55.436
Yeah.

31:55.936 --> 31:57.878
So my book's coming out.

31:59.461 --> 32:05.228
I assume that the title will come from one of the stories, and so it's just a question of... Well, not necessarily.

32:05.309 --> 32:09.534
My last book did not have a title that came from one of the stories.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.235
And why was that?

32:10.876 --> 32:24.133
Because there was no one story that I wanted to use to dominate, to direct the reader's attention that much.

32:24.153 --> 32:27.477
So I actually took a line out of one of the stories that seemed to me to cover that.

32:27.878 --> 32:29.420
cover the collection pretty well.

32:29.500 --> 32:33.426
But it goes back to the question of unity among the stories, then.

32:33.687 --> 32:46.847
And I guess that apparently by choosing a neutral title, so to speak, you did in your own mind feel that there was... I was kind of democratizing the attention that the reader would put on the collection.

32:47.568 --> 32:48.609
And I might do that again.

32:48.629 --> 32:50.192
I'm not sure.

32:50.332 --> 32:56.061
I haven't absolutely decided yet what I'm going to do with this in the way of the title.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.042
Can you just tell me

32:57.562 --> 33:00.865
Briefly, I mean, I've got the first memoir.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.306
I'm sure that stuff is in there.

33:02.326 --> 33:10.494
I haven't had a chance to go over and prepare for this interview today, but they want biographical stuff, a place of birth, and I'm sure that's in the end of the book.

33:10.674 --> 33:13.237
Well, I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, 1945.

33:13.417 --> 33:17.721
Lived in, lived all over the country.

33:17.741 --> 33:20.203
You gave me the DOB on that just for?

33:20.804 --> 33:21.784
My, my birthday.

33:21.804 --> 33:22.225
Yeah, yeah.

33:22.245 --> 33:25.628
June 19th, 1945.

33:26.485 --> 33:27.507
You don't mind these questions?

33:27.527 --> 33:29.851
No, I don't mind these questions.

33:29.951 --> 33:32.276
This is the most innocent kind of question.

33:32.296 --> 33:34.019
But it's actually kind of stupid asking them.

33:34.700 --> 33:35.862
Anyway, yeah.

33:35.882 --> 33:39.910
And lived all over the country, mostly in the Midwest.

33:40.130 --> 33:40.731
Got all that.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.196
Yeah, okay.

33:44.358 --> 33:49.708
If there's anything that you think I'm not covering and you feel that I should be, you know, please...

33:50.701 --> 33:52.723
Let's do talk about teaching.

33:52.763 --> 33:57.209
Is this something you do largely to support the family, or is it something that you get?

33:57.669 --> 33:59.672
I don't do that much of it anymore.

34:00.493 --> 34:01.994
Tell me what you teach, too, by the way.

34:02.014 --> 34:07.201
I teach literature and creative writing, a workshop in creative writing.

34:07.241 --> 34:12.126
I usually teach one class in each year.

34:12.867 --> 34:16.031
Right now, I just teach in the fall every year.

34:17.233 --> 34:18.514
So you're getting ready to start.

34:19.017 --> 34:21.521
I am starting, yep, I've already started.

34:21.541 --> 34:27.290
And I'm teaching the graduate program here at Syracuse University.

34:27.310 --> 34:31.176
And I like it.

34:31.216 --> 34:37.506
I love talking about books, especially with other passionate readers.

34:38.427 --> 34:46.780
And it's once a week for three hours, extremely intense conversations about books.

34:47.047 --> 34:48.008
a chance to share.

34:48.368 --> 34:53.093
After all, that's what I've been doing for the last 25 years, is studying and thinking about books.

34:53.193 --> 35:00.380
And it gives me a chance to share what I've learned, share what I think, share what I love.

35:01.301 --> 35:04.063
I get a lot back as well.

35:04.223 --> 35:14.353
It's nice to see the young writers I work with go on and have lives of their own as writers, which has happened a lot here.

35:14.519 --> 35:17.343
I've enjoyed teaching here.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.986
I've had plenty of chances to leave, and I haven't.

35:20.026 --> 35:20.727
I'm still here.

35:21.208 --> 35:25.734
And I know John Brock says he can't teach writing, so he calls himself a coach.

35:25.894 --> 35:27.376
Yeah, yeah, he's right.

35:27.536 --> 35:29.359
Of course, he's absolutely right.

35:29.459 --> 35:30.641
He's absolutely right.

35:31.021 --> 35:35.447
I will say this, though, that I think that

35:38.431 --> 35:45.541
I don't think I'm being arrogant to say that a lot of the writers that I've worked with are better writers for having worked with me.

35:47.584 --> 35:58.339
And I couldn't teach them to write, but I think I'm pretty good at making them aware of what they're doing and giving them their four chances of making what they're doing better.

35:59.961 --> 36:05.569
I'm a good reader, and I think that's what most young writers need, is a good, honest reader.

36:06.241 --> 36:07.923
Writing doesn't happen in a vacuum.

36:07.943 --> 36:09.044
It doesn't happen alone.

36:09.064 --> 36:10.486
It's from the earliest times.

36:10.726 --> 36:23.580
Writers would share their, you know, in earliest times, that is in our kind of recorded forms of literature, the novel, the short story and whatnot, poetry.

36:24.241 --> 36:26.243
Writers would share their manuscripts with each other.

36:26.744 --> 36:36.214
And, you know, Eliot's effect on Yeats, or Pound's effect on both Yeats and Eliot is well documented, for example.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.542
Well, he didn't teach Eliot how to write.

36:38.602 --> 36:39.944
He didn't teach Yeats how to write.

36:39.984 --> 36:47.674
But he had a very positive influence on their writing, just as other writers have had a positive influence on my writing.

36:48.715 --> 36:58.106
Ray Carver and I used to share manuscripts, and I learned a lot from working with him, and I think he may even have learned a thing or two from my readings of his work.

36:58.867 --> 37:00.910
Have you read Elizabeth Bishop's letters?

37:01.350 --> 37:02.071
No, I haven't.

37:02.091 --> 37:02.992
I hear they're terrific.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.155
I interviewed Robert Giroux.

37:06.535 --> 37:08.999
kind of interviews I'd like to do.

37:10.942 --> 37:18.853
And there was one reviewer, was it, it couldn't have been, it was the Boston Globe, which was a sacrilege.

37:18.873 --> 37:22.779
I mean, it's Gil Caldwell, she was a machine or something.

37:22.859 --> 37:27.025
I don't know if that's a question or anything like that, but really, you should read those letters, Gil.

37:27.066 --> 37:30.771
Where she is talking with Robert Lowell and all these other writers,

37:31.898 --> 37:35.803
I mean, she's not making Lowell a better poet by any means.

37:36.424 --> 37:39.708
Now, is he making her a better poet by any means?

37:40.128 --> 37:45.335
And I don't even know if there's a kind of a synergy going on here, but you certainly are meeting on common ground.

37:45.395 --> 37:46.556
To me, absolutely.

37:46.576 --> 37:59.813
You're meeting on common ground, and you are the very active writing.

38:01.835 --> 38:05.339
is, as you said earlier, you know, so solitary.

38:06.220 --> 38:07.681
It can take so long.

38:07.701 --> 38:12.787
It takes me usually about three months even to get a short story where I really, really like it.

38:13.688 --> 38:14.549
That's a long time.

38:14.569 --> 38:18.794
I know Joyce Carols can write good stories in a much shorter time.

38:18.874 --> 38:20.435
Are you underage of that, by the way?

38:20.676 --> 38:22.778
Somewhat, but not very.

38:22.838 --> 38:25.421
I mean, basically... That's a teasing question.

38:25.521 --> 38:25.801
It is.

38:25.841 --> 38:26.522
I'll tell you what.

38:26.923 --> 38:30.947
I think that one of the things that I've had to learn is that

38:31.450 --> 38:34.333
is I've had to learn how I work.

38:34.353 --> 38:38.597
And I've had to learn that I don't work like other people work.

38:38.977 --> 38:40.199
I work like I work.

38:40.219 --> 38:51.590
And once I realized, once I've learned my own rhythms, that I don't get discouraged when things take longer than I want them to, you know, or I thought they would, I understand.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.332
I work every day.

38:53.412 --> 38:59.037
I'm not lazy or anything, but I just have my own pace and routine.

38:59.838 --> 38:59.938
Yeah.

39:00.273 --> 39:01.834
Kind of a routine.

39:02.175 --> 39:03.956
Morning and afternoon.

39:04.457 --> 39:06.038
I write, you know, I try to write.

39:06.078 --> 39:08.180
When I'm working, I write about six hours a day.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.981
I try to spend about six hours a day writing.

39:10.142 --> 39:14.645
But I just, you know, my progress tends to be rather glacial, and as I say, I rewrite a lot.

39:14.726 --> 39:17.428
Looks a good day for you.

39:17.448 --> 39:19.810
How much, you mean, in the way I have words done?

39:20.491 --> 39:22.933
Do you measure it, I guess?

39:22.953 --> 39:23.914
No, I don't.

39:24.054 --> 39:26.316
I hold myself to time, not to length.

39:27.216 --> 39:29.098
Because if I hold myself to length, I just

39:29.686 --> 39:39.837
I'd feel funny about that because the main thing is that I'd just be writing as well as I can during the time I don't work.

39:39.977 --> 39:41.739
And that's the important thing.

39:41.759 --> 39:45.042
Some days I'll write a lot more than other days.

39:45.082 --> 39:46.824
What's important is to give it your best shot every day.

39:46.844 --> 39:48.846
Give it my best shot every day, exactly.

39:49.266 --> 39:53.171
And I don't hold myself to a quote of words every day.

39:53.591 --> 39:54.552
I'm not like Trollope.

39:54.632 --> 39:55.293
I can't do that.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.415
I just can't do it.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.323
Do you write on the computer first, tattoo, or do you?

40:00.504 --> 40:01.064
Yeah, yeah, I do.

40:01.185 --> 40:01.906
You didn't use that.

40:02.086 --> 40:06.692
Gradually kind of transferred my whole, it's a way of thinking, really, after all.

40:07.213 --> 40:08.314
I love the computer.

40:08.334 --> 40:08.835
I do, too.

40:08.935 --> 40:10.617
I started off very resistant.

40:10.737 --> 40:22.874
I wouldn't even use a typewriter to compose on, and when I learned to compose on a typewriter, I could never go back to writing my stuff out first, and now I have moved from the typewriter to the computer, but it took me years to do it.

40:22.894 --> 40:24.516
I mean, but now...

40:25.019 --> 40:34.149
My mind works that way, and it's a great instrument, obviously, especially for somebody who is as compulsive a rewriter as I am.

40:34.609 --> 40:38.173
I mean, it just makes all the difference in the world for me as a writer.

40:38.413 --> 40:42.657
Well, just the fact that you can revise up until the day the thing goes up.

40:42.677 --> 40:43.038
Exactly.

40:43.058 --> 40:44.359
Yeah, the press, you know.

40:44.379 --> 40:45.320
Exactly.

40:45.380 --> 40:49.805
And they say, actually, it's made for longer books, especially non-fiction books.

40:49.825 --> 40:54.790
I mean, the fact that you can just, without worrying about the pagination or anything like that, you can just go in.

40:55.428 --> 40:59.793
It's wonderful.

40:59.973 --> 41:03.336
Do you start each day by reading what you've done the previous day?

41:03.697 --> 41:04.257
Yeah, I do.

41:04.338 --> 41:06.019
I go over what I did the previous day.

41:06.039 --> 41:09.103
And you say, this is shit I got ahead.

41:09.123 --> 41:11.325
A lot of times.

41:11.345 --> 41:14.368
But then you don't have papers, so there really are no variants out there.

41:14.388 --> 41:14.869
That's right.

41:16.310 --> 41:17.412
Does that bother you at all?

41:17.472 --> 41:18.533
Not at that.

41:18.553 --> 41:21.035
I tend to, I don't keep rough drafts, anyone.

41:21.135 --> 41:21.616
I never did.

41:22.877 --> 41:24.439
I don't ever want anybody to know.

41:24.773 --> 41:30.899
how badly I write when I'm getting to, while I'm in the process of writing.

41:31.059 --> 41:37.925
It would just embarrass me no end to have anybody see what I've been, you know, what the interim stages of my work look like.

41:37.945 --> 41:39.226
I'm almost neurotic about it.

41:39.306 --> 41:41.408
I have very, I leave no footprints.

41:41.649 --> 41:44.411
All that's going to be there at the end is the book.

41:44.811 --> 41:45.872
That's what it begins.

41:45.892 --> 41:51.878
You see, in my book, there was a period there, I hope I didn't interrupt you, but...

41:52.381 --> 42:11.420
You know, you go to the HRC in Texas, where they have a 20th century archive, and you really can go through, I mean, there was a time there where they would buy people's, you know, cocktail napkins and things, writers, and Boston University has a lot of literary stuff.

42:11.440 --> 42:20.569
I guess what I'm going to do is there will not be a Tobias Wolfe archive, so far as you know, with all the variant drafts and the scribblings and the outlines and the false starts.

42:21.349 --> 42:22.050
Noblemouth, they...

42:22.283 --> 42:24.885
This stuff is lost in action, right?

42:24.905 --> 42:25.506
It is, yeah.

42:25.526 --> 42:26.627
This has been deep-sexed.

42:26.667 --> 42:28.809
This has been deep-sexed, exactly.

42:28.869 --> 42:33.193
Are you protecting yourself by doing this, or you just don't want to burden the reader with it?

42:33.213 --> 42:33.674
Oh, no, no.

42:33.694 --> 42:41.421
It's just... I have a... Your own quality control mechanism.

42:41.441 --> 42:51.210
It's my quality control mechanism, and it's also... I suppose to some extent it's my image control mechanism in that I would never want anyone to know

42:51.477 --> 42:53.399
Are you concerned about that?

42:53.419 --> 43:07.054
I'm concerned about... I'm afraid that people who saw how hard it is for me to get going on something would think I was crazy to be a writer.

43:07.855 --> 43:13.321
It's really a problem for me to arrive at the finish.

43:14.062 --> 43:17.085
Let me back up.

43:17.105 --> 43:17.806
Scratch that.

43:18.066 --> 43:18.767
It's not a problem.

43:19.355 --> 43:20.256
It's just difficult.

43:20.336 --> 43:21.637
It's very difficult.

43:21.657 --> 43:26.622
And it's not necessarily a process that I feel like sharing with anybody.

43:26.642 --> 43:27.483
It isn't important.

43:27.824 --> 43:35.111
What's important is the result that I am struggling toward, not the struggle itself.

43:35.311 --> 43:38.375
It seems kind of paradoxical to me.

43:38.395 --> 43:41.758
I mean, I understand the use of scholarship and all that.

43:45.182 --> 43:48.585
But one of the things that I do as a writer is try to make

43:53.459 --> 44:01.710
try to make the production scene, the performance, seem effortless, the way, you know.

44:01.770 --> 44:04.334
It's not supposed to look hard.

44:04.354 --> 44:05.275
It's not supposed to look hard.

44:05.295 --> 44:07.198
If it looks that hard, you haven't done it right.

44:07.718 --> 44:20.175
And so, having spent months, in a sense, producing something that looks as easy as breathing, feels natural, just, you know, effortless,

44:21.674 --> 44:26.480
I just guess I don't quite see the point in then showing everybody how hard it is.

44:26.580 --> 44:33.588
I mean, it's of interest to scholars, I suppose, but it is not of any interest to me that anyone should know that.

44:33.628 --> 44:36.692
I mean, I've gone to all these pains to conceal the effort.

44:36.752 --> 44:38.334
Why then expose it?

44:39.695 --> 44:43.400
I talked to Roger Kennedy just by paraphernalia.

44:43.420 --> 44:44.201
I don't know who he is.

44:44.221 --> 44:45.682
He used to learn.

44:46.784 --> 44:47.124
Pardon me.

44:47.164 --> 44:49.707
He used to learn the Smithsonian...

44:50.041 --> 45:00.371
He's written a number of things, but they're talking about why so many people have, one of the criticisms against the University of Texas is that they require a lot of junk.

45:00.391 --> 45:00.832
Yeah.

45:00.852 --> 45:02.574
You know, what uses it?

45:02.594 --> 45:09.661
And he said, he said, you know, sometimes the junk to the scholar is just as important as the masterpiece.

45:09.721 --> 45:10.702
Well, sure.

45:10.842 --> 45:12.123
And this, I'm just throwing this.

45:12.143 --> 45:13.164
Sure, I'm sure that's true.

45:13.805 --> 45:20.031
To see what got the person to, you know, wouldn't we love to see Shakespeare's notes?

45:21.091 --> 45:25.818
the wellsprings of creativity, the creative process working.

45:25.838 --> 45:27.140
Wouldn't we have loved to see that?

45:27.160 --> 45:31.187
So, I mean, there is some argument to be, and that's not a question, I just know that.

45:31.347 --> 45:35.834
Oh, no, no, I understand the argument exactly, but it's an argument for other people, not for me.

45:35.854 --> 45:37.036
Okay, and I respect that.

45:37.076 --> 45:48.053
Now, you did mention earlier that when you write, you are writing for a person who you hope will have similar tastes and interests as yourself.

45:48.493 --> 45:49.495
Are you also writing

45:50.116 --> 45:54.823
might we say, did you, in your mind, write for a reader a hundred years ago?

45:54.843 --> 45:57.327
No, I don't think about that too much to tell you the truth.

45:57.407 --> 46:04.217
Well, I think you do, though, because you said you're concerned about image, not image per se, but the product.

46:04.237 --> 46:07.903
You know, I'm more thinking about whoever might read it now.

46:09.265 --> 46:18.399
I mean, does it disturb you that you're not in Harold Bloom's Western canon, for instance?

46:18.419 --> 46:19.380
Right, no.

46:19.580 --> 46:24.847
No, it doesn't love to be, but I didn't think about it before you just mentioned it.

46:27.149 --> 46:32.656
That was mentioned, by the way, that Tobias Volk was not in there, in the New York Magazine.

46:32.676 --> 46:34.058
Oh, really?

46:34.078 --> 46:40.907
Stegner, I guess, again, Sybil, I didn't see him, but Sybil and Steinberg and P.W.

46:40.927 --> 46:41.307
mentioned it.

46:41.327 --> 46:43.550
Oh, I didn't even... She didn't ask me to ask you that.

46:43.570 --> 46:45.472
In fact, she asked me to ask Bloom that.

46:45.492 --> 46:46.694
I'm not doing Bloom for her.

46:46.714 --> 46:47.595
I am talking to her.

46:50.056 --> 46:54.541
Well, I think he likes a different kind of writer than the kind of writer I am.

46:54.561 --> 46:56.524
He's a little too crusty in this piece.

46:56.644 --> 47:00.388
He's just thinking, I'm reading the book.

47:00.909 --> 47:01.530
What's it called?

47:01.630 --> 47:03.252
The Western Canon.

47:03.332 --> 47:05.514
Is it an anthology?

47:05.594 --> 47:07.897
No, it's literary criticism, actually.

47:07.917 --> 47:09.539
It's the Western Canon literature.

47:09.559 --> 47:12.863
Of course, I can see why a lot of people wouldn't be in there.

47:13.103 --> 47:16.007
He really only takes 26 works, you know.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.869
He has appendices in the back.

47:18.727 --> 47:23.895
Is it interesting?

47:24.576 --> 47:25.878
Yeah.

47:25.978 --> 47:29.022
In fact, if I find the New York Magazine piece, it does mention me.

47:29.042 --> 47:31.967
Well, we'll send it to you if you have a fax or something.

47:31.987 --> 47:32.207
Sure.

47:32.227 --> 47:32.948
You have a fax.

47:33.148 --> 47:35.392
It's the same number that you... Oh, that's nice.

47:35.412 --> 47:37.355
It's a combination fax.

47:39.858 --> 47:40.419
Let's see.

47:41.260 --> 47:41.781
Where were we?

47:42.242 --> 47:42.622
Oh, yeah.

47:42.662 --> 47:43.263
Posterior.

47:43.283 --> 47:43.764
Oh, yeah.

47:43.784 --> 47:45.747
We don't have to... You only like it.

47:46.081 --> 47:54.531
I'm really getting pretty close to, unless there's anything you think that I've... Nope.

47:54.551 --> 47:56.954
I mean, two-hour interviews, for me, is terrific.

47:57.214 --> 47:58.996
That's a lot of stuff.

47:59.016 --> 48:03.201
I guess, going back, had you written The Duke of Deception, what would be in there?

48:03.241 --> 48:04.683
That's not in there.

48:05.183 --> 48:08.047
Oh, I couldn't begin.

48:08.607 --> 48:09.368
I didn't write it.

48:10.790 --> 48:11.551
I couldn't begin there.

48:11.571 --> 48:14.434
Well, I mean, you didn't write it yet, but you certainly could have written...

48:14.870 --> 48:20.135
that man's life, I think, uh, maybe as well as my brother did, really.

48:20.155 --> 48:21.436
I couldn't have written that book.

48:21.456 --> 48:22.617
I couldn't have written that, didn't you?

48:22.637 --> 48:25.620
And, uh, you know, he couldn't have written mine.

48:25.660 --> 48:29.844
We just had, as you said earlier, completely different lives.

48:30.024 --> 48:30.484
Mm-hmm.

48:30.504 --> 48:35.709
And you mentioned how you always looked up to Jeffrey and that he had lived an Italian different life.

48:36.029 --> 48:36.170
Mm-hmm.

48:36.190 --> 48:40.253
Is there ever a life that, I mean, you don't, you, you have no regrets, I guess.

48:40.273 --> 48:40.914
Oh, no.

48:40.934 --> 48:41.635
No, I don't.

48:41.695 --> 48:42.395
You wouldn't trade?

48:44.077 --> 48:44.197
Mm-mm.

48:44.217 --> 48:44.337
Mm-mm.

48:46.055 --> 48:47.997
that life.

48:48.017 --> 48:51.060
No, not for anything.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.402
That's great.

48:53.883 --> 48:55.644
And do you read each other's stuff?

48:55.985 --> 48:58.167
Oh yeah, definitely.

48:58.467 --> 49:04.473
We always exchange manuscripts.

49:04.533 --> 49:13.041
When the manuscripts are in the final stages, just before they're going off to the publisher, we always send them to each other for a good shakedown.

49:13.722 --> 49:13.902
And

49:14.135 --> 49:41.458
know we're both pretty tough we do a lot of line by line editing we you know a process like that is without value unless it's fairly ruthless and so we are quite ruthless with each other and letting each other know what our problems are with a manuscript and where we think it could be stronger and also letting each other know what what we've done right you know and I think

49:42.333 --> 49:52.643
possibly one of the most important questions that I haven't asked, or if I did ask, if I don't remember, and I think we were going to get to it, writing about the Vietnam experience.

49:52.663 --> 49:56.887
You said that, what exactly prompted you to write about it?

49:56.907 --> 49:59.770
I mean, was it because of the central event in your life?

49:59.790 --> 50:00.330
Yeah, it was.

50:00.470 --> 50:00.851
It was.

50:01.031 --> 50:08.878
And I have found myself circling the experience in different ways in my writing life.

50:08.959 --> 50:10.500
I've written short stories that

50:10.953 --> 50:12.475
I've never actually written a short story.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.979
I've written only one short story actually set there.

50:16.141 --> 50:21.709
And it's totally fictional.

50:22.110 --> 50:34.129
I mean, it has elements of moral autobiography in it, but the events themselves are invented.

50:34.850 --> 50:39.036
And I was trying to catch something.

50:39.725 --> 50:41.087
some internal truth.

50:43.390 --> 50:46.274
But I, uh... Well, what was that piece?

50:46.294 --> 50:46.955
Do you remember the name of it?

50:46.975 --> 50:50.901
Yeah, it's called Memorial, and it was published in Granta last year.

50:51.081 --> 50:55.127
Oh, recently.

50:55.147 --> 50:58.171
Uh... Characters are completely different from me and my friends.

50:58.251 --> 51:04.360
I mean, you know, but guys, guys, people like, you know, familiar characters to me.

51:04.660 --> 51:06.262
Guys I knew in the Army were like that.

51:07.364 --> 51:08.145
And, uh...

51:11.332 --> 51:19.642
Unlike Tim O'Brien, who seems to have so many demons to exercise in that experience, he writes you basically about nothing else.

51:19.682 --> 51:25.610
You don't have any similar demons, I would assume.

51:25.630 --> 51:27.652
No, I don't think so.

51:27.713 --> 51:35.142
I mean, there are demons who I wouldn't have written in the book, but I don't think they're as hard on me as Tim's are on him.

51:35.562 --> 51:40.849
And partly that's because I think Tim just had a harder time of it over there than I did.

51:41.453 --> 51:46.640
I mean, I think that's really what it comes down to.

51:46.660 --> 51:48.983
I mean, he really had a very rough time with it over there.

51:49.043 --> 51:50.345
I should send you the interview.

51:50.565 --> 51:51.547
Yeah, I'd love to read it.

51:51.567 --> 52:04.464
And the one that they're not using, because it's at least 50% longer where he talks about this, but I mean, that imagery of Pinkville, you know, of course it was just because of these pink areas on the map were shaded pink, and they were built up.

52:04.484 --> 52:09.351
But I mean, he said it was pink, and he actually feels that there's a time with evil

52:09.820 --> 52:22.317
oozes through the clouds, and you can feel it, and you can taste it, and you can smell it, and, you know, because he was through Milai six or seven or eight months after that, which is the core incident of this novel.

52:23.739 --> 52:36.396
And this guy is, this guy is haunted by this, whatever happened, whatever the hell happened over there, I mean, it's, and you can see, and it drives this character to madness.

52:36.857 --> 52:39.220
It looks like King Lear going off into the, you know,

52:40.027 --> 52:42.690
on the motorboat at the end.

52:42.710 --> 52:45.914
He says he's not going to write anymore, huh?

52:45.934 --> 52:46.815
It's unbelievable.

52:46.835 --> 52:48.217
And I challenged him on it.

52:49.358 --> 52:55.345
You can imagine your wife and your wife's name, children, and my husband.

52:57.748 --> 52:58.569
Catherine.

52:58.589 --> 53:00.551
My wife's name is Catherine.

53:00.611 --> 53:02.413
It's in here, yeah.

53:03.274 --> 53:06.338
She's a...

53:12.292 --> 53:14.514
She's a therapist.

53:14.534 --> 53:14.855
Okay.

53:15.255 --> 53:18.678
Ah, a therapist, a therapist, a pandemic therapist.

53:18.699 --> 53:21.822
And you're in Syracuse?

53:21.842 --> 53:23.884
Yeah.

53:23.904 --> 53:25.986
And we have three children.

53:26.006 --> 53:28.068
We have two boys.

53:29.089 --> 53:30.290
Michael is 15.

53:30.350 --> 53:31.151
Patrick is 14.

53:31.171 --> 53:36.196
We have a little girl, Mary Elizabeth, who's four and a half.

53:36.216 --> 53:39.460
Well, this will come out, what, in October?

53:39.480 --> 53:39.660
October.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.561
She's five.

53:40.581 --> 53:40.881
Okay.

53:42.177 --> 53:44.261
But I never see him in my last bag.

53:44.441 --> 53:46.445
That's my oldest son.

53:46.465 --> 53:47.527
Or my youngest son.

53:47.547 --> 53:48.048
Not for you.

53:48.268 --> 53:48.929
He's a karate.

53:50.712 --> 53:51.855
Is any of this stuff you wear?

53:51.875 --> 53:53.077
Yeah, that stuff's mine.

53:53.217 --> 53:56.343
Because you look like you've stayed in pretty good shape.

53:56.623 --> 53:58.246
You know, writing is so sedentary.

53:58.487 --> 54:00.450
I have to do something.

54:00.610 --> 54:05.940
Yeah, I knock off for half an hour when I'm at work and, you know, do some Nordic track or

54:07.186 --> 54:11.292
knock off another half hour later on and lift some weights just to tone up a little.

54:11.452 --> 54:12.895
Then I'd go for a walk later on.

54:12.975 --> 54:15.478
I usually swim every day, too.

54:15.538 --> 54:17.842
I'd go crazy otherwise.

54:17.882 --> 54:20.886
How much do you swim?

54:21.007 --> 54:24.872
I swim over a mile a day, usually.

54:24.892 --> 54:26.395
I mean, everyone was pretty spare.

54:26.435 --> 54:28.858
I have to say, this is a writer's room.

54:28.878 --> 54:31.082
They don't see a lot of books and a lot of mementos.

54:31.142 --> 54:34.226
I mean, you have the poster from the movie up there.

54:34.246 --> 54:36.670
But I guess when you fuck through, it's all business, right?

54:37.207 --> 54:37.908
Yeah.

54:37.928 --> 54:39.290
That's why I'm not near the window.

54:40.371 --> 54:41.993
I can't be near a window when I'm writing.

54:42.053 --> 54:43.214
You should see John Irving's office.

54:44.075 --> 54:46.098
It's, it's, I mean, first of all, the house.

54:47.079 --> 54:48.140
Where does he live now?

54:48.161 --> 54:48.881
Up in Vermont.

54:49.282 --> 54:50.283
He's still in Vermont.

54:50.303 --> 54:53.387
But he's got this place literally on the side of a mountain.

54:53.407 --> 54:57.031
The upstairs on the second floor of the house, where are you?

54:57.051 --> 54:57.552
Third floor.

54:57.612 --> 54:58.994
Third floor.

54:59.014 --> 55:02.618
A modest suburban, or I guess it's not suburban, or the city.

55:02.678 --> 55:03.359
No, it's a city house.

55:03.379 --> 55:04.060
It's a city house.

55:05.342 --> 55:06.403
But the desk really...

55:07.193 --> 55:11.399
is against the wall, and you kind of have a... The eaves there.

55:11.559 --> 55:18.509
One of the eaves coming in, and the closest window is to your back, and that's... That's for light.

55:19.811 --> 55:22.775
And I don't go... You do have a window overhead, I guess.

55:22.975 --> 55:23.416
Skylight.

55:23.697 --> 55:25.319
Skylight.

55:25.339 --> 55:27.983
And, I mean, so I get... I'm too easily distracted.

55:28.563 --> 55:30.126
I can't be near a window when I'm writing.

55:30.146 --> 55:30.847
How about noise?

55:30.987 --> 55:34.031
I mean, you've got a four-year-old kid.

55:34.211 --> 55:35.293
This place is soundproof.

55:36.067 --> 55:38.070
Have you heard anything?

55:38.090 --> 55:39.032
Not a thing.

55:39.052 --> 55:39.813
You haven't heard a thing.

55:39.833 --> 55:41.055
You're making lots of noise down there.

55:41.075 --> 55:41.737
You can be sure of that.

55:41.837 --> 55:43.520
I've got all three kids at home right now.

55:43.540 --> 55:43.880
Really?

55:44.081 --> 55:45.283
Yeah.

55:45.303 --> 55:47.206
And if there's noise, it will bother you.

55:47.907 --> 55:48.668
There's a lot of it.

55:48.889 --> 55:50.171
I can hear the words.

55:50.852 --> 55:53.156
Generalized, distant noise doesn't bother me.

55:53.597 --> 55:54.298
Kind of white noise.

55:54.378 --> 55:58.425
But things are very quiet here, especially in the winter.

55:58.946 --> 56:02.091
Obviously, I have to have the windows open now because the weather's warm.

56:02.442 --> 56:06.187
Coffee, kids outside, that kind of thing doesn't bother me much.

56:08.050 --> 56:11.996
But in the winter when it's all buttoned up up here, you can't hear a thing.

56:12.016 --> 56:13.958
Neutic track, what's that thing over there?

56:13.978 --> 56:16.041
Oh, it's some sort of a universal light machine.

56:16.923 --> 56:17.483
Do you use that?

56:17.884 --> 56:19.867
Yeah, I use it.

56:20.147 --> 56:23.131
I just hate to have to think of what this stuff is.

56:23.152 --> 56:25.014
We have a few books here to read.

56:25.114 --> 56:25.495
Okay.

56:25.515 --> 56:30.542
Just tell me the cover art for the book.

56:30.978 --> 56:47.674
Yeah, the cover art for the book was based on a photograph I took over there of the, from a helicopter, a shot of the town that I was stationed in that was later largely, a lot of it was destroyed during Tet.

56:47.914 --> 56:57.103
And the cover artist, the person who did it, then treated that photograph with tremendous impact.

56:57.353 --> 57:07.284
I think brilliance and altered it to suggest the ominous future that hung over that town.

57:07.324 --> 57:16.133
There's a sense of danger in the air and even of, you know, you feel the destruction hanging over it.

57:16.174 --> 57:24.863
I think it's got an almost surreal quality to it, very powerful.

57:25.568 --> 57:29.454
Was this something you proposed, or was this something they asked about?

57:29.474 --> 57:34.142
No, we were fooling around with different covers, and then they said, well, you know, do you have anything?

57:35.264 --> 57:40.012
And I sent them down all the pictures I had, which were not very many.

57:40.052 --> 57:44.499
I had taken several, but most of them were lost over the years, and I sent down what I had.

57:44.579 --> 57:46.783
So it was really there.

57:47.506 --> 57:51.009
I mean, by itself, the picture is, I think, rather non-script.

57:51.029 --> 57:56.474
It wouldn't have been one I would have thought necessarily, but it's just what he did with it that makes it so special.

57:56.494 --> 57:58.295
Yeah, an art director.

57:58.315 --> 58:01.037
He's really, really... Archie Ferguson.

58:02.198 --> 58:03.700
This Boy's Life, was that with Hogan?

58:04.520 --> 58:07.103
Or was that with... That was with Atlantic Monthly Press.

58:07.123 --> 58:11.626
Sorry, that was with Atlantic Monthly Press, which is basically... They did a beautiful cover, too.

58:11.646 --> 58:12.667
I love that cover on that.

58:12.727 --> 58:13.768
No, that was art.

58:13.808 --> 58:16.290
That was a painting, I think.

58:16.310 --> 58:17.091
Yep, that's right.

58:17.307 --> 58:19.834
Yeah, that's a great with the car going in the road.

58:19.894 --> 58:22.883
I was looking for the darn thing last night to go over it.

58:24.327 --> 58:25.611
And I have it in my section.

58:25.791 --> 58:27.857
I'm sure I couldn't find it.

58:27.897 --> 58:28.920
I've never watched a book.
