WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:04.294
Key to tape, so here's what I say.

00:04.314 --> 00:05.015
Okay, good.

00:05.135 --> 00:08.720
The tape is running, and we're talking with Professor Gerda Lerna.

00:09.561 --> 00:20.935
One of the chapters in my new book, by the way, I should tell you, is very interesting, which will have particular interest to you, will be on the influence of the Jewish emigre booksellers.

00:21.695 --> 00:22.056
Really?

00:22.617 --> 00:26.241
Yes, I've been trying to locate as many of the survivors as I can.

00:26.261 --> 00:29.065
I've already interviewed a number of... There are many.

00:29.205 --> 00:31.067
There aren't many left.

00:31.087 --> 00:31.928
There were many.

00:31.908 --> 00:33.410
Really, that's very interesting.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.372
They were extraordinary.

00:34.392 --> 00:54.220
I just want to include the poet Felix Pollack, who came to Madison as an established, he had a law degree from Vienna and was a poet in German and became a librarian.

00:54.959 --> 01:01.713
And built up the finest small press collection, I think, in the country at the UW.

01:01.733 --> 01:02.034
Really?

01:02.214 --> 01:03.356
How do we spell his name?

01:03.376 --> 01:04.899
P-O-L-L-A-K.

01:05.240 --> 01:05.821
Is he alive?

01:06.202 --> 01:06.964
No, he's dead.

01:07.986 --> 01:12.495
But I think he did a great job in terms of, you know, books.

01:12.948 --> 01:26.983
Well, one of the areas I'm researching is that not only did these people come and bring their knowledge and their expertise, but they brought an attitude of book selling, of scholarship.

01:27.183 --> 01:28.945
These people didn't just sell books.

01:28.985 --> 01:30.066
They understood books.

01:30.106 --> 01:32.308
They explained books.

01:32.348 --> 01:34.751
They discovered why certain books were important.

01:34.771 --> 01:40.997
It does feed into, in a way, what you write about, why history matters, why certain texts matter.

01:40.977 --> 01:48.216
And it sounds to me like this Felix Pollack, has anything been written about him at all?

01:48.436 --> 01:57.720
Well, he's been very widely recognized as a poet, and he has also been recognized now in Austria and in Germany.

01:58.207 --> 01:59.589
as a major poet.

02:00.290 --> 02:02.492
But about this aspect of his life, no.

02:03.153 --> 02:06.757
You might want to talk to his widow.

02:06.817 --> 02:07.358
Okay.

02:07.719 --> 02:09.040
Who lives here.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.202
I can give you her number.

02:10.222 --> 02:11.043
That would be wonderful.

02:11.183 --> 02:12.745
And just tell her that... I will.

02:13.145 --> 02:13.926
I suggested it.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.868
Her name is Sarah Pollack.

02:16.149 --> 02:17.170
S-A-R-A-H.

02:17.591 --> 02:18.432
S-A-R-A.

02:19.232 --> 02:20.394
No H. Okay.

02:20.834 --> 02:24.619
And it's 608-238-

02:25.291 --> 02:26.233
8147.

02:26.834 --> 02:27.455
Oh, wonderful.

02:28.116 --> 02:34.368
You know who else I've interviewed already is Otto Bettman, who is now 96, 97 years old.

02:36.252 --> 02:40.279
But I was amazed to see that not only is he alive,

02:40.613 --> 02:55.693
but wonderfully lucid, living in Florida, and as soon as I heard that he had sold, that the Bettman archive had been sold to Bill Gates, which of course does presage the future, I went to see him, and he played a Bach piece for me.

02:56.294 --> 03:09.372
Well, you see, the difference is that the European middle-class intellectuals had a very broad education, and I think that's what we brought, a very broad education.

03:10.128 --> 03:24.509
One was not just a, you know, it was expected that you were to be conversant with the literature of at least two languages, with arts, with music, with theater, with opera.

03:24.529 --> 03:25.951
That was like standard.

03:25.971 --> 03:29.336
I mean, you couldn't, you know, my father was a businessman.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.220
He was a passionate chamber music player.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.118
You know, normal.

03:35.341 --> 03:40.572
And Dr. Bettman's father, it was a similar situation, you know.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.278
His father played with a group, music.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.290
And then, of course, as the Nazis... We have music concerts in the home every month.

03:48.731 --> 03:49.332
I...

03:49.801 --> 03:54.526
grew up with the entire classical chamber music literature.

03:54.546 --> 04:00.493
And I think, like yourself, it took Dr. Bettman many, many years to agree to go back to Germany.

04:02.054 --> 04:09.502
And he really didn't want to go, and it took a great deal of... And maybe this provides a way into the discussion here.

04:11.424 --> 04:15.128
Why did you feel that you had to write a book with the title, Why History Matters?

04:15.228 --> 04:18.692
What are the anxieties that you have that would occasion such a title?

04:18.712 --> 04:19.453
Well, I think history...

04:19.906 --> 04:46.302
is under attack in this culture but much worse it is being ignored and i think a whole generation or two have grown up thinking history doesn't matter at all and you know when i was president of the organization of american historians in 1982 i was the first woman president in 50 years of any of the historical

04:46.484 --> 04:50.088
I sort of broke the barrier.

04:51.090 --> 05:03.765
At that time, history education was in such a crisis that we were graduating PhDs that couldn't get jobs.

05:04.906 --> 05:16.440
And the pressure was on me to use the organization's authority and the authority of my office to encourage people to cut down on the training of historians

05:16.859 --> 05:19.803
on the grounds that there were no jobs for them.

05:20.304 --> 05:26.814
I resisted that totally and said, on the contrary, we're dealing with a small blip.

05:26.934 --> 05:33.745
The demand for historians is going to rise, and furthermore, we're not a trade school.

05:34.386 --> 05:37.430
We don't just train people to enter the trade.

05:37.651 --> 05:42.478
There are many people that can take a PhD in history into other fields.

05:43.471 --> 06:12.415
and I was proven right and there was an upswing in employment and so I ever since that time I've given a lot of thought to that so that's one reason the other reason is that as you get older I think all of us become more preoccupied with our own history with explaining to our grandchildren you know what it was like when that sort of thing and

06:13.171 --> 06:29.109
I've been, you know, and having played a role in creating a new field of history, as I have, I've always had to answer questions of, well, why do you do this?

06:29.249 --> 06:30.971
And what's the point?

06:32.373 --> 06:40.782
And I feel very strongly that the history-making is a...

06:41.504 --> 06:43.286
a basic human necessity.

06:43.326 --> 06:58.860
In fact, it is what distinguishes us from animals because we are the species that is able to transmit to its children what went on before we came.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.322
And animals can't do that.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.724
And that makes the difference.

07:03.784 --> 07:04.905
That makes us human.

07:05.105 --> 07:10.110
So doing history is a basic human necessity.

07:10.782 --> 07:30.148
And the last major reason why I think this is a very felicitous choice of title is that for the past 30 years I've been occupied in helping to restore the history of women.

07:31.350 --> 07:39.321
And women, as you may know, are more than half of the human population and they've been deprived of history.

07:40.162 --> 07:55.281
And I have seen and experienced what the absence of history means to people, and conversely, the dynamic energizing effect on people when they become aware of history.

07:55.301 --> 08:00.567
So I really think I know why history matters, and I wanted to share that.

08:01.205 --> 08:15.837
You say being denied history, now that women have a sense of history, almost ironically, you see in some quarters people saying, well, why does history matter?

08:16.518 --> 08:17.679
Is that a paradox there?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.182
You know, we're talking about half the human population.

08:21.662 --> 08:28.128
So some people, you know, not all people in half the population will have the same opinion.

08:29.149 --> 08:30.570
The women who have

08:30.955 --> 08:37.123
studied women's history, absolutely know its significance and are very, very much interested in it.

08:37.984 --> 08:42.190
And they're not the same women that say history doesn't matter.

08:42.590 --> 08:59.933
I see the acquiring of history and of a historical sense as a way of giving meaning to your own life and pursuits.

09:00.605 --> 09:02.867
And I have seen it happen many, many times.

09:05.089 --> 09:10.433
I have had classes.

09:10.453 --> 09:15.638
For example, in the 70s, I organized.

09:15.658 --> 09:30.510
In 1976, I secured a number of grants and cooperated with the Smithsonian Institution and Sarah Lawrence College to hold a

09:30.929 --> 09:37.537
seminar in women's history for leaders of women's organizations.

09:37.557 --> 09:49.330
And we invited 45 women from 45 organizations, and they had to be either president or educational director or something on that level, okay?

09:49.350 --> 09:50.211
High officials.

09:50.932 --> 09:54.476
And we had every major women's organization in the country represented.

09:55.818 --> 10:00.463
And we had a 21-day workshop where they lived together

10:01.135 --> 10:03.799
and we immersed ourselves in women's history.

10:04.761 --> 10:12.594
Out of that group, at least five women pursued a higher educational degree as a result of that.

10:13.295 --> 10:14.577
But that was the least of it.

10:15.338 --> 10:25.675
They adopted it as a class project, the project of institutionalizing Women's History Month nationally, and that is the group that did it.

10:26.144 --> 10:29.748
That comes directly out of my seminar.

10:29.988 --> 10:30.289
Really?

10:30.309 --> 10:31.470
And when was this, Doctor?

10:32.071 --> 10:32.491
1976.

10:32.551 --> 10:37.256
So really, it goes, because Women's History Month is every March, I believe.

10:37.297 --> 10:39.559
Yeah, it was proclaimed by President Carter.

10:40.060 --> 10:49.811
And in order to get it proclaimed, you have to get the signatures of every member of Congress, of a majority of the House and Senate.

10:49.831 --> 10:51.272
And that has been done every year.

10:51.573 --> 10:52.854
Was there resistance to this?

10:53.415 --> 10:53.755
No.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.836
It was popular.

10:55.856 --> 11:01.313
It was a cheap way for the politicians to placate women.

11:02.337 --> 11:03.861
Without really having to give anything.

11:03.962 --> 11:06.309
It took a lot of work and organization.

11:06.931 --> 11:08.436
Now it's well established.

11:08.838 --> 11:12.262
But my name is on the first proclamation by the president.

11:12.683 --> 11:13.464
Oh, that's wonderful.

11:13.544 --> 11:18.811
Every March, I also write a children's book review column.

11:18.831 --> 11:20.053
I have a number of projects.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.596
Once a month, I review eight books.

11:23.797 --> 11:27.823
And for March, I took note of Women's History Month.

11:28.343 --> 11:36.234
Well, but what I'm saying, I'm citing this as an example of the dynamic impact of consciousness of history.

11:36.935 --> 11:37.155
Okay?

11:37.175 --> 11:37.275
Okay.

11:37.525 --> 11:46.319
on a group of women who are all, I mean, these women were self-selected to be practical, politically oriented organizers, right?

11:46.339 --> 11:58.538
These are not your intellectuals that sit and study books, and yet they were so energized by the concepts of women's history that they engaged on a big national campaign.

11:59.378 --> 12:00.881
So not only history.

12:01.362 --> 12:02.926
That wasn't my idea, by the way.

12:03.046 --> 12:03.828
I resisted it.

12:03.948 --> 12:05.151
I thought it was too ambitious.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.073
You resisted what?

12:06.133 --> 12:06.634
Which idea?

12:07.235 --> 12:10.121
To do this as a project.

12:10.141 --> 12:11.725
I said, this is crazy.

12:11.745 --> 12:12.687
This is too ambitious.

12:12.707 --> 12:14.010
It's reaching too high.

12:14.110 --> 12:18.720
And they said, well, you gave us the history, so now leave the organizing to us.

12:18.903 --> 12:20.305
And I said, okay.

12:20.325 --> 12:23.329
And I thought that's the last I'd hear of it, but it wasn't.

12:23.710 --> 12:27.935
Do you see a parallel with Black History Month?

12:28.496 --> 12:29.998
I mean, the same kinds of forces?

12:30.219 --> 12:38.610
Well, it's a parallel impulse to restore history to people who have been denied their history.

12:39.652 --> 12:45.720
Of course, the big difference between minorities and women is women are the majority.

12:46.105 --> 12:53.615
And if you can keep the majority ignorant of their past, you can do almost anything in social engineering.

12:54.075 --> 12:58.200
Isn't that what Orwell says quite specifically in 1984, George Orwell?

12:58.321 --> 13:00.043
I think he says that quite specifically.

13:00.423 --> 13:00.684
Really?

13:00.864 --> 13:01.745
I have not read it.

13:01.765 --> 13:04.488
Yeah, to control the future, you control the present.

13:04.508 --> 13:06.651
To control the present, you control the past.

13:06.731 --> 13:08.393
That's true.

13:08.514 --> 13:09.194
Then he knew it.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.076
He was right.

13:10.276 --> 13:10.957
He understood it.

13:10.977 --> 13:11.978
I haven't read that.

13:11.958 --> 13:21.170
Dr. Vartan Gregorian pointed this out to me in a recent interview that I did with him for this new book.

13:21.210 --> 13:29.341
But I want to also point out to you the very sort of specific way when I say women were denied their past.

13:30.342 --> 13:37.051
This was a systematic and organized denial, okay?

13:37.071 --> 13:39.855
And while not every man...

13:40.088 --> 13:43.012
then alive was participating in it.

13:44.013 --> 13:48.760
It always, in every country in the world, it was done in the same way.

13:48.940 --> 14:02.839
And the way was, first of all, educationally disadvantaged women, systematically, all over the world, so that up until the last two decades of the 20th century,

14:03.477 --> 14:07.964
women's illiteracy was infinitely higher all over the world.

14:07.984 --> 14:08.345
Really?

14:08.505 --> 14:08.725
Male.

14:08.905 --> 14:10.568
Are there figures to support that?

14:10.588 --> 14:10.889
Oh, certainly.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.933
Where would I find those figures for this new book that I'm writing?

14:13.953 --> 14:18.921
You would find that in my book, The Creation of Feminist Conscience.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.362
Okay, good.

14:19.642 --> 14:25.511
Where I give an overview of the educational disadvantaging of women over 2,000 years.

14:27.094 --> 14:31.020
And it was done by...

14:31.709 --> 14:39.199
making both men and women believe that thinking was a male hormonal function.

14:41.903 --> 14:45.668
I'm sorry to laugh.

14:45.688 --> 14:48.913
I never quite put it that way, but it's true.

14:48.933 --> 14:49.874
Thinking is male.

14:50.455 --> 14:52.818
Women are not capable of abstract thought.

14:53.799 --> 14:57.885
And even as late as the 1880s in this country,

14:58.422 --> 15:09.275
There was a famous, when the big, you know, there was a large woman's movement then, and they were pushing for the establishment of colleges.

15:09.596 --> 15:11.818
They were pushing for college access to women.

15:12.920 --> 15:25.695
And this Dr. Clark then did a study on, I think, six people and came to the learned conclusion that if women use their brains,

15:26.317 --> 15:31.864
the blood would rush to the brain and would be displaced from the uterus where it belongs.

15:31.884 --> 15:39.374
So women who had education would be incapable of performing their female function.

15:39.394 --> 15:40.936
This is in your book?

15:40.956 --> 15:41.837
Oh, yes, yes.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.540
And this was enormously influential.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.823
Dr. Clark was cited for 20 years.

15:47.124 --> 15:47.404
Wow.

15:47.825 --> 15:50.909
All right, so that's one part, educational disadvantaging.

15:51.489 --> 15:55.935
Secondly, categorizing women as being incapable of thought.

15:56.506 --> 16:24.808
And third, and this is perhaps of interest to you especially, because there were in every century for at least 1,500 years, women, individual women who exercised their brains, who had acquired education and mostly as a class privilege, so it were the richer women, the women of the nobility and so forth,

16:25.328 --> 16:34.164
and who left a valuable and enormously interesting body of work dealing with the status of women.

16:34.686 --> 16:35.710
These books were

16:36.297 --> 16:43.265
Hardly, if they were printed at all, they were printed in tiny editions, and they were never reprinted.

16:43.385 --> 16:48.791
That would definitely indicate to me a conspiracy, as you pointed out.

16:48.891 --> 16:49.913
Not a conspiracy.

16:50.393 --> 16:52.956
Nobody ever said, let's do this to women.

16:53.216 --> 17:01.125
There was never a cabal that got together and... No, no, that would be a very gross distortion of what I'm saying.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.129
Okay, but you did say systematic, so it does... Systematic, yes.

17:04.349 --> 17:05.190
Systematic.

17:05.592 --> 17:14.665
caused by superstition, by belief, the mythical belief in the inferiority of women.

17:14.685 --> 17:19.812
So if you even saw something done by a woman, it couldn't be significant.

17:22.576 --> 17:25.901
You were taught to believe that it had to be insignificant, right?

17:27.022 --> 17:31.288
They were taught to believe it, and therefore they made it that way.

17:31.749 --> 17:32.410
In other words...

17:32.626 --> 17:35.330
And this is, by the way, still with us.

17:35.650 --> 17:44.223
I mean, books by women are not as frequently reviewed in the major reviewing places.

17:44.283 --> 17:46.727
Do you really think that's the case, though?

17:46.807 --> 17:49.571
Well, we're beginning to break out of it.

17:49.731 --> 17:54.278
But it's maybe 10 years old that it's not the case.

17:54.818 --> 17:56.881
Before that, it was absolutely so.

17:57.102 --> 17:57.683
Absolutely.

17:58.424 --> 18:01.468
And, you know, why did the...

18:01.972 --> 18:08.599
Why did the Brontes and other great novelists take male names?

18:08.679 --> 18:11.702
I was just about to ask quite the same question.

18:12.083 --> 18:12.684
That's why.

18:12.944 --> 18:13.464
That's right.

18:14.005 --> 18:14.586
That's why.

18:15.106 --> 18:19.371
And then, of course, when it became known that these were women, there were attacks on them.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.153
That's what I'm saying.

18:22.334 --> 18:26.679
It didn't require a conspiracy since everybody believed in it.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.763
It's the same as with white supremacist ideas.

18:31.132 --> 18:39.787
as long as everybody believed them to be true and God-given, you didn't have to have people get together and say, let's do this, that, and the other thing.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.909
They knew how to do that.

18:41.610 --> 18:43.373
You just let them do what they were taught to do.

18:43.854 --> 18:53.511
Do you see a parallel relevance here between what you're writing about and talking about and this debate that

18:53.947 --> 19:02.798
That seems to rage throughout the land on the culture wars, the arguments over which canons, literary... Well, it's not a parallel.

19:02.878 --> 19:22.283
It's this culture war, so-called, is in fact the response of traditionalists to the challenges mounted by feminism and by the scholarship of people in minority groups.

19:23.107 --> 19:27.872
we have finally reached a stage where they have to take us seriously.

19:27.892 --> 19:33.397
Before, they just ridiculed us and marginalized us.

19:33.418 --> 19:36.020
But now we have made inroads.

19:37.221 --> 19:40.745
A new generation of students is fascinated by what we're doing.

19:42.587 --> 19:45.770
The courses we're giving are overfilled every place.

19:47.172 --> 19:50.775
And so people are fighting back.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.557
The traditionalists are fighting back.

19:53.009 --> 20:02.479
And they're fighting back in a very, actually very hackneyed and unimaginative way because they don't usually bother to read what we write at all.

20:02.799 --> 20:05.482
You know, they just, they know beforehand that it's no good.

20:07.304 --> 20:16.734
Well, I guess the defense is, you know, it kind of picks up on the characterization of who cares about a bunch of dead white European males.

20:16.914 --> 20:22.240
Well, you know, that's one of those things that's like, you know,

20:22.760 --> 20:29.349
It's like this old canard that every black man is looking to marry your sister, you know?

20:30.831 --> 20:32.994
No feminist ever said that.

20:33.935 --> 20:40.044
That is, you know, no feminist ever said, let's not learn about dead white men.

20:40.805 --> 20:42.607
That's something that was invented.

20:42.747 --> 20:44.350
Maybe some students said that.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.153
Students say all kinds of outrageous things.

20:47.234 --> 20:48.075
They're young people.

20:48.916 --> 20:49.797
But...

20:49.996 --> 21:05.634
In fact, in most feminist scholarship, the heroes, the male heroes and icons of the traditional culture are taken very seriously and interest in them is revived.

21:06.095 --> 21:13.163
But we're looking at them from the point of view of the people who were also there and were not mentioned.

21:14.144 --> 21:19.530
Okay, so, I mean, a very good example seems to me is Aristotle.

21:20.320 --> 21:25.606
Aristotle, you know, is certainly one of the pillars of Western civilization.

21:25.646 --> 21:30.252
You can't study Western culture without studying Aristotle.

21:30.973 --> 21:48.133
But if you study Aristotle and ignore the fact that he was living in a society in which slaves and women were oppressed, then what Aristotle wrote is not seen in its full roundness and fullness.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.956
You have to understand that.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.261
That doesn't mean we don't study Aristotle.

21:52.943 --> 21:55.188
We just don't omit that fact.

21:56.931 --> 22:02.944
I don't see how any intelligent person could argue against that.

22:02.964 --> 22:07.033
Well, they are arguing against that because they don't read what we say.

22:07.351 --> 22:11.037
They just set up these straw men and start hitting them.

22:11.057 --> 22:30.507
But it does concern me, I think, as a former English major and a reader of literature, that when I hear it reported, for instance, that Amherst College, a marvelous institution, three years ago graduated summa cum laude,

22:31.313 --> 22:40.802
a graduate in English, a major, an English major, who never took a course in Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, or Dryden, you know, or Spencer.

22:41.803 --> 22:52.073
How is it possible that a person who could purport to be a major in English literature... Well, you know, these anecdotal evidences, first of all, I don't know where this comes from.

22:53.074 --> 22:54.015
I doubt it greatly.

22:55.877 --> 22:57.939
I could cite a source for that, but that's irrelevant.

22:58.079 --> 23:01.202
Well, it's not irrelevant, because most of these anecdotes have

23:01.655 --> 23:03.219
turned out to be false.

23:03.861 --> 23:08.553
This person may have had a very thorough training as an undergraduate.

23:08.934 --> 23:13.787
The English courses is 20 courses in Shakespeare and therefore got credit for this.

23:13.887 --> 23:15.732
I mean, really.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.444
Can I assure you, I would never report this unless I checked it out.

23:21.145 --> 23:22.546
And I haven't yet, okay?

23:22.646 --> 23:23.387
Well, try it.

23:23.407 --> 23:26.791
Well, I intend to go to the English department at Amherst and say, is this true?

23:27.331 --> 23:29.453
And in fact, I'd like to talk to the student.

23:31.636 --> 23:37.362
The sense is that if it's a summa cum laude, the individual must have probably known a great deal already about Shakespeare.

23:37.762 --> 23:38.483
Exactly.

23:38.763 --> 23:40.645
In other words, I doubt this very much.

23:41.266 --> 23:42.327
But secondly...

23:42.627 --> 23:50.395
If it was so and I were a professor at Amherst, I would have probably objected to it.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.338
But that's not the issue.

23:53.919 --> 24:05.390
The issue, you know, culture and literature are not zero-sum games that if you put in some new people, you leave out the others.

24:06.131 --> 24:07.993
That's not how education works.

24:08.699 --> 24:21.196
People who are interested in education and who learn how to read and comprehend and how to research, that's what we're supposed to teach them in the university.

24:21.236 --> 24:26.383
We're supposed to teach them how to research and think and interpret.

24:26.924 --> 24:33.593
We're not supposed to teach them a certain quantity of you have to know so much of this and so much of that

24:33.910 --> 24:35.792
I think that's a very false thing.

24:35.812 --> 24:36.853
You know, I couldn't agree more.

24:37.013 --> 24:51.747
Educated persons, as we have said about these refugees, you know, you could take everything away from them and they will come as paupers into a new country and they will bring their inquisitive minds and their good habits of scholarship with them.

24:52.268 --> 24:54.350
That's what we're supposed to teach in college.

24:54.870 --> 25:02.618
And if I have to take a student who is, let us say, an African-American student

25:03.222 --> 25:14.232
who has never been taught anything about people like himself in a positive way and who comes to school and is turned off by school because of that.

25:15.132 --> 25:31.687
And if I have to give him a heavy dose of a year or more of nothing but African-American history, culture, literature, in order to get him to begin to engage intellectually, I can then lead that student to a broader view.

25:31.707 --> 25:32.908
And that's what we're doing.

25:33.766 --> 25:38.132
Nobody is saying you study only narrow things.

25:38.733 --> 25:40.836
I can just speak of my own experience.

25:40.916 --> 25:48.906
I am the founder of the first graduate program in women's history in the United States at Sarah Lawrence College in 1972.

25:49.067 --> 25:53.412
We've graduated 99 students out of that program.

25:53.973 --> 25:55.295
That's a master's program.

25:55.435 --> 26:00.302
I then went on to found a Ph.D.

26:00.362 --> 26:03.486
program in women's history at the University of Wisconsin.

26:03.719 --> 26:04.380
Madison.

26:06.202 --> 26:12.371
When I came in the history department there were 55 members of the history department and I was the third woman.

26:15.015 --> 26:18.740
We have graduated some 26 PhDs.

26:20.222 --> 26:33.220
The basis of our program that I set up was that every student in our program has to meet all the requirements of the American history PhD plus

26:33.537 --> 26:37.523
a parallel additional requirement in women's history.

26:38.845 --> 26:46.696
The result is that every one of our students has been hired and has a splendid job because they're the best trained historians.

26:46.716 --> 26:47.617
That's wonderful.

26:47.637 --> 26:47.878
Okay.

26:48.398 --> 26:52.004
Why don't we cite that instead of that one Amherst student?

26:52.044 --> 26:53.185
Well, that's great.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.350
That's the answer I was looking for, by the way.

26:56.370 --> 26:57.512
Here it is.

26:57.692 --> 27:01.958
This is a fact, and you can verify that, and I would very much like for you to

27:02.545 --> 27:10.097
to take an interest in that because we don't have a PR person.

27:10.278 --> 27:12.922
We do this ourselves.

27:13.383 --> 27:14.645
Well, who would I contact?

27:15.065 --> 27:18.451
Oh, Professor Linda Gordon.

27:19.092 --> 27:19.973
Linda Gordon.

27:19.993 --> 27:21.897
And Professor Gene Boydston.

27:22.357 --> 27:24.481
Gene with two... J-E-N?

27:24.661 --> 27:24.942
J-E-A?

27:25.442 --> 27:26.925
E-N-N-E.

27:26.945 --> 27:27.085
Uh-huh.

27:27.419 --> 27:29.281
I can give you their numbers.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.723
What is her surname again, please?

27:30.983 --> 27:34.047
Boydston, B-O-Y-D-S-T-O-N.

27:34.067 --> 27:34.367
Okay.

27:34.447 --> 27:39.393
She is, at the moment, the acting director of the program, but they're co-directors.

27:40.334 --> 27:44.038
Linda Gordon is not teaching this semester, but you can reach them both.

27:44.839 --> 27:46.280
If you want, I'll give you their number.

27:46.300 --> 27:46.801
Fine, please.

27:47.382 --> 27:47.862
608.

27:47.982 --> 27:51.086
I'll give you the office number.

27:51.106 --> 27:55.511
2630647 is Gene Boydston.

27:55.531 --> 27:55.671
Mm-hmm.

27:56.478 --> 28:00.301
And Linda Gordon is 263-1777.

28:02.777 --> 28:02.877
Okay.

28:03.650 --> 28:09.357
I mean, they can... Do you know Jean Hedrick at Trinity College?

28:09.878 --> 28:10.519
Joan Hedrick?

28:10.539 --> 28:13.883
I don't know her, but I know Barbara Sitcherman at Trinity College.

28:13.903 --> 28:21.312
Yeah, she wrote the wonderful book on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of, was it Harriet Beecher still?

28:21.492 --> 28:22.854
Oh, yes, right, right.

28:23.054 --> 28:28.361
I did a really wonderful interview with her last summer for this new book I'm working on.

28:29.782 --> 28:29.983
Wonderful.

28:30.003 --> 28:31.024
Well, I...

28:31.342 --> 28:35.287
I just read today's Times, this Trinity College president.

28:35.327 --> 28:36.047
Exactly, yeah.

28:37.289 --> 28:38.110
Thanks, too.

28:38.130 --> 28:41.454
All right, well, anyway, I mean, that much on the culture.

28:41.474 --> 28:43.296
Well, let's talk a little bit about my book.

28:43.316 --> 28:51.065
Okay, well, actually, we have, you know, but let's actually direct ourselves more directly to it.

28:51.145 --> 28:52.426
But we have been there.

28:52.526 --> 28:56.691
You have given me a lot of quotes, by the way, that absolutely are, I think...

28:57.110 --> 29:10.005
um appropriate to to the to the book here because we are talking about why history matters i mean i ask you a question when we talk about the absence of history uh you're aware of course in 19 was it 1994

29:10.188 --> 29:36.297
uh when when the uh national library of serbia in sarajevo was destroyed quite deliberately probably to destroy the history if you're going to ethnic cleanse a people and eliminate them right you have to destroy their history don't you it was not the first library that was destroyed of course not remember the library in alexandria that was destroyed uh by the invaders and so on this has been a

29:36.918 --> 29:40.021
And, of course, the Nazis with their book burning.

29:41.643 --> 29:43.765
Yes, that's true.

29:44.766 --> 29:47.769
You write, of course, about your experiences.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.771
Yes.

29:50.192 --> 29:59.982
Did you have an awareness then that this was the destruction of heritage and history, or was it more of a more personal anxiety, do you think?

30:00.002 --> 30:02.104
Well, I mean, the book burnings were horrifying.

30:02.865 --> 30:04.967
I mean, the fact that

30:05.892 --> 30:07.015
Books were burned.

30:07.255 --> 30:11.505
I think it's one of the most terrifying signs of barbarism.

30:11.625 --> 30:20.205
And at the time, we didn't know that the gas ovens were next, but in a sense, it's an inevitable sequence, you know.

30:22.784 --> 30:25.928
For this collection, a number of the essays are new.

30:26.669 --> 30:26.950
Yes.

30:26.970 --> 30:28.672
And I think it's very important to point that out.

30:28.732 --> 30:36.162
This does not merely reflect work produced over a period of... No, no.

30:36.262 --> 30:37.203
Half of them are new.

30:38.485 --> 30:40.007
And I think that's important to point out.

30:41.189 --> 30:43.972
So this for you was a new work entirely.

30:44.012 --> 30:44.493
Oh, yes.

30:44.974 --> 30:45.254
Oh, yes.

30:45.635 --> 30:49.720
The ones that are old...

30:50.341 --> 30:59.764
all but one have really been printed only in very small, you know, editions of a few hundred.

31:02.150 --> 31:08.265
Mostly lectures, but for the first time in print.

31:08.870 --> 31:21.461
Tell me about the thinking that went into saying it's time for this book, why you felt, and how you see all these essays coming.

31:21.481 --> 31:28.668
Well, I think I answered that already at the beginning, but I will answer it in a more personal way.

31:28.688 --> 31:32.091
Okay.

31:32.131 --> 31:36.615
The book is called Why History Matters, Life and Thought.

31:37.102 --> 31:52.602
And what I had in mind initially was simply to gather together some work that would illuminate the main themes in my work over the last 30 years.

31:54.024 --> 32:00.031
And I didn't have that title in mind, and I just had in mind the title History and Thought, Life and Thought.

32:00.852 --> 32:05.218
And the reason for Life and Thought is that, as I said before, you know that

32:05.637 --> 32:15.311
age-old belief that men are in charge of thought and women are in charge of living, daily living and social relations and all that.

32:16.052 --> 32:25.485
And I always felt that that was wrong and I also felt that the artificial separation between life and thought was wrong.

32:25.745 --> 32:32.775
We are, you know, when we do our best thinking, we bring our life into it and

32:33.751 --> 33:02.121
when we do our best living we should bring our thought into it and I was sort of interested in showing that and collected the essays from that point of view and decided to put in some autobiographical essays to show essentially the sources of my thought you know and then I when the book was all finished all together

33:02.573 --> 33:03.935
I didn't like the title.

33:03.955 --> 33:06.460
I thought it was not specific enough.

33:07.061 --> 33:11.228
And then I put this title and several others on a sheet of paper.

33:11.288 --> 33:24.290
And as soon as I came to Why History Matters, I realized that actually the whole effort was inspired by a conviction that history matters.

33:24.811 --> 33:28.497
And so then I changed the arrangement somewhat.

33:28.898 --> 33:30.980
And I added the last essay.

33:31.320 --> 33:38.427
And in that essay, I tried to sort of synthesize 35 years of my thought and work.

33:39.729 --> 33:45.434
And so in many ways, it's a very personal book.

33:45.454 --> 33:54.383
And it's also an experiment for me because I was a writer long before I became a historian.

33:55.527 --> 33:58.251
Which your work reflects, by the way.

33:58.271 --> 34:01.296
I find it very accessible writing.

34:01.476 --> 34:02.517
Right, right.

34:03.258 --> 34:14.355
I mean, people should not be, and we'll talk about the perceived audience for this, I think people should not be scared away by the publication of Oxford University Press, for instance.

34:14.956 --> 34:16.778
No, it's a very accessible book.

34:17.820 --> 34:24.049
My readers are, I have many more readers outside of the academic world than inside.

34:24.670 --> 34:28.034
I always have for all my books.

34:28.054 --> 34:36.605
But I have never before tried to combine the two voices, so to speak, the literary voice and the academic voice.

34:37.586 --> 34:41.571
And this was an effort to do so, and I think it's interesting from that point of view.

34:42.232 --> 34:46.577
People have told me that they respond very well to that.

34:46.844 --> 34:50.048
There was a wonderful review of this book last week in the Boston Globe.

34:50.129 --> 34:50.850
Yes, there was.

34:51.571 --> 34:53.293
Yes, I was very gratified by that.

34:53.313 --> 34:55.977
It was a wonderful review, I have to say.

34:56.858 --> 35:02.486
I had just received the review copy myself, and I instantly called Oxford the following morning.

35:02.546 --> 35:04.228
I said, I'd love to talk to this woman.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.474
That's the happy consequence of that review.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.198
Do you have a reader in mind?

35:12.901 --> 35:14.363
Can you visualize a reader?

35:14.703 --> 35:16.125
No, I write for...

35:17.067 --> 35:18.149
All kinds of readers.

35:18.790 --> 35:20.453
I write for men and women.

35:22.596 --> 35:26.442
I guess, to a certain extent, I always write for my grandchildren.

35:28.265 --> 35:30.689
That's wonderful.

35:31.350 --> 35:31.671
I do.

35:31.851 --> 35:33.975
I have three grandsons and a granddaughter.

35:36.419 --> 35:43.851
I have already tried out the first chapter on my grandson, who is 11.

35:44.692 --> 35:46.334
Now, what do you mean by that, though?

35:46.815 --> 35:50.521
Obviously, you're talking more than just for children.

35:50.601 --> 35:52.364
I think that you're talking... Oh, of course.

35:52.424 --> 35:53.345
It's not for children.

35:53.405 --> 35:59.234
No, but what I'm saying is, you're talking for the future, and I understand what you're saying, which you're writing for the grandchildren.

35:59.835 --> 36:13.095
Yes, I'm writing... I'm hoping to write... I mean, I'm hoping that when the first enchantment with the new media culture will have run its course...

36:13.987 --> 36:20.357
We're now in the second generation of children that were raised on television.

36:21.098 --> 36:31.755
And by that I mean children to whom television is as much of a cultural presence, if not more, than all their living relatives and teachers.

36:32.075 --> 36:32.877
All right?

36:33.658 --> 36:40.428
This is new in the history of the world, and we have not yet even begun to understand the consequences.

36:41.390 --> 36:42.171
But I think

36:43.788 --> 37:06.737
the next generation after that one, or even the youngest of the current generation, my grandchildren's generation, they will rediscover printed culture, and they will rediscover a longer view of, a more philosophical view of search for meaning in life.

37:08.039 --> 37:12.985
And I think in that search for meaning, understanding histories

37:13.370 --> 37:19.398
in the way that I'm trying to explain it here, it's going to be very helpful to them.

37:20.599 --> 37:22.001
And this is who I'm writing for.

37:22.381 --> 37:26.507
Will they rediscover printed culture in print or through other media?

37:26.727 --> 37:28.750
It doesn't matter how they discover it.

37:29.491 --> 37:41.986
It doesn't matter if they would rather listen to it on the tape while they're driving and doing something else, or if they would rather, you know, have it on a CD-ROM and read it on the computer.

37:42.006 --> 37:43.208
That doesn't bother you.

37:43.812 --> 37:53.348
No, I think they're missing something very important in not knowing what it is to have an original in your hand.

37:53.808 --> 37:55.972
But I think that too will come back.

37:58.035 --> 38:08.993
But I think that we already see that the new media can lead people to a greater appreciation of

38:09.648 --> 38:15.045
of the old media, for example, the phenomenon of Opera Winfrey's book club.

38:15.065 --> 38:15.848
Isn't that amazing?

38:15.988 --> 38:17.694
I mean, that's very encouraging.

38:18.376 --> 38:19.018
It really is.

38:19.058 --> 38:22.088
It's a remarkable phenomenon, and I think we...

38:22.203 --> 38:25.948
It just indicates what could happen if we use the media better.

38:26.368 --> 38:40.026
Well, also, you have spawned now thousands of other book clubs, which, I mean, that seems to be a phenomenon that's sprouting up all over the country now, these book clubs.

38:40.046 --> 38:52.041
Well, I think you have two kinds of phenomena that are sprouting out, that have sprouted up in this consumer culture and TV culture, media culture.

38:52.291 --> 38:58.479
that are directly countervailing forces.

38:58.539 --> 39:11.977
One is these various book and culture clubs, and the other is the various self-help groups that people are in, or support groups, support networks.

39:13.379 --> 39:19.547
Both of those represent a search for community and a search for meaning beyond one's own life.

39:20.152 --> 39:21.976
That's the essence of my message.

39:22.097 --> 39:23.440
That's what history gives you.

39:24.442 --> 39:26.306
It gives you that sense.

39:26.326 --> 39:27.048
That's marvelous.

39:28.271 --> 39:30.276
We've got a lot of good material here, by the way.

39:30.937 --> 39:37.232
Okay, well... Let's continue for a little longer if you want, but I want to assure you that

39:37.499 --> 40:00.165
you've given me a lot of excellent material here for this piece so uh you know the the reading of the book it falls on my shoulders so so don't be concerned if i haven't asked it will be yours that's that's right so don't be concerned if i haven't asked you directly about the essays you know they they quite eloquently speak for themselves so so i think we really are touching on points that

40:00.533 --> 40:01.754
that do matter to me.

40:01.814 --> 40:03.436
You talk about printed culture.

40:03.476 --> 40:04.497
Do you mean book culture?

40:04.537 --> 40:06.840
Do you have a sense of what book culture is?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.682
What is book culture?

40:09.323 --> 40:13.988
In fact, it works into the subtitle of my new book.

40:14.008 --> 40:18.873
I'm really interested in the status of book culture on the eve of a new millennium.

40:20.295 --> 40:29.865
Well, you know, I think any historian or any person who studies history will tell you of the enormous

40:30.773 --> 40:44.829
revolutionizing impact of the printed word on history, you know, historically, and it wasn't immediately manifest in the way that we would think of it now.

40:45.349 --> 40:55.560
I mean, when Gutenberg first printed the Bible, the next things that were printed were religious pamphlets, right?

40:55.580 --> 40:56.261
That's correct.

40:56.281 --> 40:59.785
And the printing of religious pamphlets in large numbers

41:00.541 --> 41:05.569
was largely what enabled the spread of the Protestant Reformation.

41:06.311 --> 41:08.614
Without it, it couldn't have happened the way it did.

41:09.756 --> 41:15.967
So that was long before people in general were reading books, right?

41:16.247 --> 41:17.369
That's absolutely correct.

41:17.730 --> 41:26.464
And it took about a hundred years or perhaps, or more, before the real potential of the new medium

41:27.203 --> 41:46.262
was beginning to be realized and implemented, namely to get the thought of the past into the hands of a broader, literate public, still male at the time.

41:46.282 --> 41:54.831
And, well, if you compare that now, everything happens faster in the 20th century, but it doesn't happen that much faster.

41:56.414 --> 42:16.862
And I'm, you know, I'm very impressed with the enormous potential of the new media for education and for improvement, whereas at the moment they're mostly being used in a very negative way.

42:18.123 --> 42:18.884
You know?

42:19.565 --> 42:24.632
And I hope that if we...

42:25.304 --> 42:35.481
you know, if we keep working at it, enough people keep concerned with it, that we're going to begin to develop the positive potential.

42:35.501 --> 42:45.658
Certainly, let's say, a revival of interest in Jane Austen and in the Bronte's, the great novelist, you know, English novelist, through

42:46.162 --> 42:49.206
television is a very, you know, it's a very good thing.

42:49.607 --> 42:50.307
Sure.

42:50.328 --> 42:53.492
Shakespeare being produced in movies.

42:53.732 --> 42:54.193
Right.

42:54.233 --> 42:56.716
You don't need to study Shakespeare in a course.

42:57.277 --> 43:01.462
You can see Shakespeare on TV and in the movies.

43:01.502 --> 43:01.983
Exactly.

43:02.283 --> 43:02.984
On cassettes.

43:03.145 --> 43:04.767
So this is wonderful.

43:05.227 --> 43:09.553
More people are conversant with Shakespeare today than were

43:09.803 --> 43:15.150
when the so-called classical curriculum reigned and only very few people had access to it.

43:15.170 --> 43:18.394
Very few male persons had access to it.

43:19.276 --> 43:20.157
Keep that in mind.

43:20.658 --> 43:27.306
The things we leave out also matter very much.

43:27.487 --> 43:38.241
And by leaving out of consideration who were the people that were engaged in that traditional culture, we leave out...

43:39.065 --> 43:43.229
It's very negative aspects.

43:43.809 --> 43:46.552
It was a training ground for elites.

43:47.833 --> 43:54.439
We call this current age the information age, and I think it is appropriate because information is really nothing more than data.

43:54.860 --> 44:07.131
Information is right, but I think what we are missing the most is ways of making it a new cultural renaissance, which it could be.

44:07.668 --> 44:09.149
which as yet it is not.

44:10.170 --> 44:17.196
And you did earlier predict a return to the values and disciplines of what you call the printed culture.

44:17.677 --> 44:19.298
You do foresee that, I guess.

44:19.478 --> 44:34.972
Well, I think that what we are able to do now, theoretically, and this, you know, the proliferation of interest in Shakespeare and in the British novelists and so forth, is an example.

44:35.553 --> 44:35.953
We...

44:36.423 --> 44:55.009
The new media would enable us, if we weren't so interested in using them only for commercial gain, but really use them educationally, we could spread the old printed culture to people who never before had a share in it.

44:55.850 --> 44:58.434
This we're able to do, right?

44:58.634 --> 44:59.796
Right, exactly.

45:00.116 --> 45:06.345
I mean, I remember coming to a village in northern Italy

45:06.882 --> 45:34.982
where I didn't speak the language, and I was staying in a small, like, hotel that was really run by, like, a teenage girl was at the counter, and her mom was in the kitchen, and I was spending a real quiet evening, didn't know anybody there, and she said, she invited a gesture that I should watch the television with her.

45:35.468 --> 45:37.472
And what were we watching?

45:37.532 --> 45:43.021
Her favorite program, Columbo.

45:43.041 --> 45:43.141
Okay?

45:43.162 --> 45:45.486
And all of a sudden, we had something in common.

45:45.526 --> 45:48.952
We were talking about the Columbo programs with our hands and feet, you know?

45:49.352 --> 45:49.753
That's funny.

45:49.773 --> 45:55.984
Well, it could have been, you know, with a little bit of luck, it could also have been Shakespeare or Jane Austen, right?

45:56.004 --> 45:56.565
But it wasn't.

45:57.693 --> 45:59.296
But that's a wonderful story.

46:00.738 --> 46:05.045
I think there might have been one other question that I wanted to ask you.

46:05.125 --> 46:07.870
I think your voice is fading.

46:08.010 --> 46:08.471
I'm sorry.

46:08.491 --> 46:09.633
I'm looking at my tape.

46:09.693 --> 46:10.073
That's why.

46:10.093 --> 46:11.376
Let's see if we're waiting on it.

46:11.396 --> 46:14.941
I think we've covered a lot of area here.

46:16.344 --> 46:17.085
What do you think?

46:17.572 --> 46:23.335
Well, one of the, I think, perhaps one area I would like to speak about.

46:23.616 --> 46:23.817
Okay.

46:23.857 --> 46:27.352
Just before you do that, let me just turn the tape on the other side so we start fresh.

46:27.432 --> 46:27.733
Okay.
