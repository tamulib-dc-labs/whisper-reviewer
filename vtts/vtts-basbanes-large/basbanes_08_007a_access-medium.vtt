WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:07.486
I mean, my own city, but it's a book too.

00:08.788 --> 00:21.664
I guess in general, I wonder if you could just give me some thoughts on your body of work as an evolving literary form, the essay as a, I mean, you must see this as a corpus of work, certainly.

00:23.287 --> 00:32.198
Yeah, I mean, in the prefaces to the various volumes, probably more than this than anything else I've

00:34.456 --> 00:37.380
try to figure that out retrospectively, but it's retrospective.

00:37.440 --> 00:54.062
I never, I don't, maybe that's why it works, if it works as a body, because I, if you're self-consciously trying to build an effort, probably it wouldn't work, it should be too vain, it should be too rigid.

00:54.082 --> 00:55.324
I never think about that.

00:55.364 --> 00:57.446
I just write an essay every month.

00:57.466 --> 01:01.712
And when I was first asked, it's not as though I had plans to become a

01:01.979 --> 01:03.701
writer of general science.

01:03.761 --> 01:06.564
I had only written technical articles.

01:06.664 --> 01:07.925
They knew me around the museums.

01:07.945 --> 01:16.835
I've been a graduate student there, and I had done one piece for them on Irish Elves as a regular piece, but I didn't really even know what an essay was.

01:16.935 --> 01:19.278
I didn't formally study literature.

01:19.298 --> 01:20.439
I liked essays.

01:20.519 --> 01:30.670
I knew Huxley's work and Haldane's, and I think they was, I don't want to sound pretty idiotic, I'd probably read Montaigne in colleges, because I had a decent

01:31.460 --> 01:33.042
pretty classical education.

01:33.062 --> 01:34.483
I'm sure I read some one thing.

01:34.984 --> 01:39.488
So in some sense I knew, but it's not as I went into this knowing that I wanted to write essays.

01:39.508 --> 01:41.930
In fact, I didn't even know what I was doing with called essays.

01:41.971 --> 01:51.020
If you look at my earlier ones, I call them columns, and at some point I realized I started calling them essays, because I realized that these days were what they were.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.482
I discovered for myself a very old genre.

01:53.862 --> 01:59.208
Every time I put out one of these books, and this is the seventh, I just look at the last 35 or 40.

01:59.228 --> 02:01.450
I throw out a few I don't like anymore.

02:01.733 --> 02:08.841
And they seem to always fall together in reasonable groupings, but they're not planned in advance now.

02:08.901 --> 02:10.062
But the volumes do differ.

02:10.343 --> 02:14.808
They do, and this is three years of, this I guess represents basically three years of work.

02:15.588 --> 02:16.329
Yeah.

02:16.349 --> 02:21.735
But there is, you must be mindful of the fact that you're not reading yourself basically.

02:21.755 --> 02:23.978
I mean, there are themes certainly that you come back to.

02:24.899 --> 02:31.386
When I started writing them, I was in my early 30s.

02:33.408 --> 02:38.773
A person in their early 30s is going to be thinking differently than a person verging on their mid-50s, as I am now.

02:40.715 --> 02:42.497
Also, climates have changed.

02:43.238 --> 02:45.060
It is interesting for me to look back through them.

02:45.080 --> 02:54.349
If I look at the first book, Ever since Darwin, which I don't like that much anymore, because I hope I've gotten better, those are the first attempts of the Darwinian essayists.

02:54.389 --> 03:00.495
That is, they lay out some very basic material in Darwinism, which I wouldn't

03:01.758 --> 03:03.461
for the most part, write about now.

03:03.481 --> 03:04.543
I'd be too didactic.

03:05.745 --> 03:07.909
I include material like that, because a lot of people don't know it.

03:07.989 --> 03:09.351
I always do, and I always will.

03:11.875 --> 03:22.914
And then you sort of go along in the series, and the panda's thumb seems to emphasize some of the difficulties of darkness, which I've laid out the basic stuff.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.639
And then you look at the third one, hen's teeth and horses' toes, and

03:26.075 --> 03:51.373
was written in the midst of all this creationism nonsense when they were powerful in the late 70s before we beat them in the supreme court there's a lot of contemporary politics and historical also i was writing this mismeasure of men then and then uh you go along flamingo smile bully for brontosaurus and you see that i sort of discovered history and contingency and an interest in it and so yeah they do uh they do alter but

03:51.809 --> 03:53.011
There's nothing I've ever sat down.

03:53.031 --> 03:57.518
In fact, the only way I find out that they've altered is when I look at them.

03:57.538 --> 04:01.625
Well, you mentioned your first book, which you just said you don't much care for anymore.

04:02.026 --> 04:06.273
Given the chance, are you one of these perfectionists who would like to go back and tinker?

04:06.293 --> 04:06.894
Oh, no.

04:06.974 --> 04:07.395
No, no.

04:07.435 --> 04:08.416
Or is it completed work?

04:08.477 --> 04:09.017
No, history.

04:09.498 --> 04:11.141
Omar Khayyam was right.

04:11.201 --> 04:13.585
Moving finger rights and having read moves on, right?

04:14.046 --> 04:14.847
What was that for again?

04:15.248 --> 04:16.049
I love that.

04:16.069 --> 04:17.111
Oh, my God.

04:17.272 --> 04:18.734
I was moving your rights and having wit.

04:18.754 --> 04:24.184
Moose on, or all your piety, no wit, can cause it to cancel half a line, or all your tears.

04:24.284 --> 04:25.807
Wipe out a word of it.

04:26.388 --> 04:30.294
You're from a generation that had to memorize those things, right?

04:30.314 --> 04:35.163
You mentioned, you know, I went to Bates, which is not unlike the... Yeah, no, in fact, I considered Bates.

04:35.183 --> 04:37.467
The only reason I... I almost applied there.

04:37.487 --> 04:39.771
I liked Bates, and I didn't because they didn't have a geology department.

04:40.088 --> 04:45.033
I remember there was a course in geology, which is rather rudimentary.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.314
Yeah, no, there was no department.

04:46.334 --> 04:46.935
There may be now.

04:47.295 --> 04:47.976
Well, it's interesting.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.537
I like this, actually.

04:49.557 --> 04:54.762
You actually have always wanted to, I mean, this is something that you set your mind on.

04:54.802 --> 04:57.345
This is your profession from childhood, isn't it?

04:57.385 --> 04:57.865
Right.

04:58.186 --> 05:00.448
And that's really pretty spectacular.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.511
Well, you know, maybe, but it's not rare for paleontology.

05:03.531 --> 05:06.574
I'll tell you, sort of, I just want to say one more thing about the tinkering.

05:06.594 --> 05:08.796
The main reason I wouldn't tinker is that

05:09.788 --> 05:33.248
it's not that i have a ridiculously developed sense of my place it isn't that it's that these books are written at moments in history they're going to go into the dustbin also but yeah you don't want to mess around with it i mean wonderful since people ask me do you want to are you going to put up an updated version of wonderful life or or i'm talking about our first technical book

05:33.937 --> 05:34.558
I wouldn't do that.

05:34.598 --> 05:35.379
It was written in 1989.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.823
It's the way things look at the moment.

05:37.843 --> 05:43.793
If I want to revisit a subject, I'd write another book, because there's, you don't want to, the books have structure, you know?

05:45.115 --> 05:45.215
Yeah.

05:45.235 --> 05:53.067
Yeah, if something that I've once said would prove to be totally wrong, well, I'd probably just withdraw the book, but, uh... Can you think of anything after that?

05:53.087 --> 05:53.308
Yeah.

05:53.328 --> 05:59.117
I bet you really can't give them the... Oh, sorry, essays, of course, because, I mean, you can't write 250 essays and not... Yeah.

05:59.468 --> 06:01.230
not have some of them turn out wrong.

06:01.330 --> 06:14.022
Oh, sure, there's a one in Emerson Starwin on Eight Language, which I now believe doesn't amount to anything, and then, you know, I'd probably deep six, although there are other parts of that essay that are pretty good.

06:14.382 --> 06:29.357
No, I was going to say with respect, a lot of people seem quite amused or interested by this story about me visiting the Museum of Natural History when I was five, but it's not, I've always wondered why people like that story so much, because

06:29.759 --> 06:31.081
It's not rare for paleontologists.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.483
Well, I think we see a lot of ourselves in it.

06:32.724 --> 06:37.592
I mean, I would have loved to have been an archaeologist for now as a kid.

06:37.612 --> 06:38.794
But it's interesting.

06:39.274 --> 06:47.127
If you survey people in most professions, I suppose it's true that most people wander into it in college years.

06:47.227 --> 06:50.873
But if you survey paleontologists, a lot of them are

06:51.325 --> 06:54.150
ones who just promoted a childhood fascination.

06:54.430 --> 06:55.091
It's not rare.

06:55.111 --> 07:07.072
A lot of paleontologists began in small children in cities, either going to museums in cities or living in rural or farm areas and collecting fossils in their local region.

07:07.092 --> 07:07.633
It's not rare.

07:07.653 --> 07:10.117
A lot of my colleagues were into it as kids.

07:10.458 --> 07:17.029
Did you have any, this would really be a very pressing idea, which I'm sure you have, but

07:17.684 --> 07:27.619
You know, one of the byproducts of your work is that you have really made science very accessible and very likable, user-friendly, to use a horrible clichÃ©.

07:29.022 --> 07:35.211
But you certainly have millions of people, many, many thousands of great work.

07:35.231 --> 07:35.632
That's good.

07:35.692 --> 07:37.795
Evolution's a good subject.

07:38.176 --> 07:45.447
I mean, were you mindfully pursuing, mindfully trying to seek out

07:46.135 --> 07:47.096
a popular audience?

07:47.116 --> 07:48.558
No, I don't think that works.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.103
I think you have to write essays for yourself.

07:52.183 --> 07:56.809
It may sound selfish, but it's not meant to be, unless you... Yeah, but they're so accessible, though.

07:56.829 --> 07:58.271
I mean, you're not writing... Oh, well, sure.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.893
There's no obvious obfuscation here.

07:59.913 --> 08:07.002
I mean, you're writing... No, I'm writing them, so... But I don't write them any... If I were writing them only for my professional colleagues, I'd write them the same way.

08:07.743 --> 08:10.567
That is, there's no simplification of concepts.

08:10.607 --> 08:12.309
There's no simplification of language.

08:12.350 --> 08:15.754
No, I want them to be readable by everyone.

08:16.460 --> 08:30.956
But this is an old, as I like to say, it's an old tradition that goes back to Galileo, who chose to write both his books as dialogues in Italian and not as treatises in Latin, rather that Copernicus's was a Latin treatise, his most scientific books were.

08:31.537 --> 08:45.673
The notion that you can present science, not watered-down science, but real science for a literate audience of general readers, a lot of people think that Darwin's Origin of Species is a popularization of something

08:46.126 --> 08:48.930
of some technical article that must be in a journal somewhere, and it isn't.

08:49.090 --> 08:55.880
That's just how he presented the material to the world, which, when you think about it, is a great part of humanism.

08:56.061 --> 08:58.084
If I'm trying to do anything, it's to recover that.

08:58.104 --> 09:10.943
I just read something that, I forget where I read it, but when you think of the great scientific texts, that really is one that's in print and that's read, you know, as opposed to someone who's ever read, you know, The Principia.

09:11.243 --> 09:13.146
I can tell you, I've never tried it.

09:13.278 --> 09:18.302
Right, no, even in English it's not readable.

09:18.323 --> 09:33.876
But basically Darwin did write this extraordinary... Yeah, and the Galileo Congress is good, because you have, as you correctly say, you have Copernicus in the generation before him, Newton in the generation after him, writing in the conventional mode, which are treatises in Latin.

09:34.457 --> 09:37.980
And here's Galileo, writes both his major books as dialogues in Italian.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.962
You know, it's really quite something.

09:40.382 --> 09:42.424
And is there any...

09:43.433 --> 10:08.817
understanding of why he did this and beyond the fact i don't know enough no i i think it's wonderful i think the answer is look at what brecht actually makes a big point of in galileo now we know that brecht brecht's galileo is a 20th century boxer's version it's different but but brecht says in the play and i think i think he's actually right i mean he interprets it too politically that galileo did it to speak to the common man against the church i don't think that's right no i think he did it because he he wanted

10:09.792 --> 10:11.194
He wrote to be read.

10:11.214 --> 10:12.415
He was a reader.

10:12.516 --> 10:21.187
He knew that his potential supporters were, after all, not the church and university, which was so high about his potential supporters, was the rising mercantile class of Italy.

10:21.748 --> 10:26.274
Not what he did for Brecht's proletarian motives, certainly not.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.797
He was writing for a wealthy businessman, if anything.

10:29.338 --> 10:37.048
Now, we know you grew up in New York, and you mentioned going to the museum, where your first impressions were made.

10:37.501 --> 10:41.386
What's your take on the dinosaurs that we're down there?

10:41.406 --> 10:42.948
Oh, I love the new mammal hall.

10:42.968 --> 10:44.010
There's an essay in there.

10:44.530 --> 10:44.831
I don't know.

10:44.851 --> 11:01.352
You see, the thing is that by redoing the mammals in this conceptually different way, that is, clavistically, by order of their time and branching, you do something that's conceptually quite innovative, because humans are on an early branch.

11:01.993 --> 11:07.120
We end up not at the end of the hall, the traditional position, but about a third of the way through.

11:07.420 --> 11:09.243
And people say, why are humans off in a corner?

11:09.303 --> 11:11.085
Humans are supposed to be at the end, is the crown.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.247
And then you start thinking about it.

11:12.868 --> 11:17.434
Problem is, there isn't a similar false icon of dinosaurs.

11:18.035 --> 11:22.881
So if you reorganize dinosaurs by timing of their branching, which is what they did.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.206
See, the old dinosaur hall there were by geological time.

11:26.226 --> 11:29.210
They had one hall for Jurassic dinosaurs, one for Cretaceous dinosaurs.

11:29.771 --> 11:32.054
In the new one, they've just done it by branching order.

11:32.074 --> 11:35.579
And they have one hall for Ornithysian dinosaurs and one for Sorskian dinosaurs.

11:35.599 --> 11:36.280
But so what?

11:36.800 --> 11:46.150
There's no popular myth that's exploded by this reordering, whereas for the mammals there is a popular myth that's exploded.

11:47.251 --> 11:51.315
So, therefore, it really just becomes a question of aesthetics.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.198
It's very hard to see the hall because it's so crowded.

11:54.779 --> 11:56.641
Kids all the time, which is wonderful.

11:56.661 --> 11:59.984
But for my taste, it's a little dizzy.

12:00.004 --> 12:02.807
It's a little overly crowded, the majesty.

12:03.344 --> 12:06.928
of the spacing of the old hall has not been retained.

12:07.269 --> 12:23.407
And also, even though they had to do it, I would have done it too, the new postures, which have Tyrannosaurus with a horizontal vertebral column, makes them quite low to the ground, he just looks so much less scary and so much less majestic than in the old vertical post.

12:23.427 --> 12:28.433
They had to do it because they couldn't in any honesty have done anything else.

12:28.513 --> 12:29.454
It's not a criticism.

12:29.474 --> 12:32.878
It's just the way science works.

12:33.263 --> 12:43.055
Being a traditionalist, certainly in this area, I'll bet, just to totally jump subjects here, that I'm reading that they're proposing interleague play between the American and the National League.

12:43.075 --> 12:44.596
Well, you know, it's a funny thing.

12:44.957 --> 12:46.318
It isn't driving me nuts.

12:46.358 --> 12:53.587
I'm a great baseball traditionalist, and I'm against the extra tiers of playoffs.

12:53.687 --> 12:55.089
I'm against grass.

12:55.269 --> 12:58.713
I have artificial turf, and I'm against big ballparks.

12:59.214 --> 13:01.296
You can't find anyone more traditional than me.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.744
But I actually don't object that much to interleague play, and I'll tell you why.

13:04.764 --> 13:27.346
I mean, the whole system arose capriciously, its contingency again, because when the National League was founded, pardon me, when the American League was founded in 1901, the National League was so haughty about it, they really were trying to, I mean, McGraw wouldn't play the 1904 World Series against Boston because, you know, he thought the American League was such an upstart, which was the only year it was canceled, because Hocking was striking, quote me.

13:27.366 --> 13:28.347
That's why I like it.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.425
So I think it was anomalous from the start that there wasn't in the league.

13:32.465 --> 13:37.373
The one good thing about not having in the league play is it makes the World Series.

13:38.374 --> 13:43.181
But the World Series is so degraded anyway by having two layers of play.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.323
It doesn't matter.

13:44.343 --> 13:47.067
Any other wild card bullshit.

13:47.248 --> 13:48.850
So why not have in the league play?

13:48.870 --> 13:53.457
And also, it's funny, it's the one reform I don't really object to.

13:53.622 --> 13:55.884
It makes sense, especially if they do it locally.

13:56.064 --> 13:56.685
It's good for rivals.

13:56.705 --> 13:57.786
Where were you on the DH?

13:58.186 --> 13:59.688
I'm against the DH.

14:00.969 --> 14:07.195
The one good thing about the DH is that it does allow older players like Reggie Jackson and David Winfield to hang around.

14:07.215 --> 14:08.776
That's good, because fans like to see them.

14:09.537 --> 14:12.600
But they used to hang around as pinch hitters, so they got a little less work.

14:13.281 --> 14:20.187
But the main thing about the DH is it's just so destructive of interesting strategies.

14:20.487 --> 14:34.584
When you have the pitcher having to hit, there's just so much more in the way of... Remember the old batting orders of our youth, still in the National League, where because you had a weak ninth hitter, you would construct the batting order in such a way.

14:34.905 --> 14:36.347
Now there's no variation to it.

14:36.367 --> 14:37.848
You just throw all your good hitters in.

14:37.888 --> 14:43.195
The National League play is much more interesting than that, so I'd love to see them get rid of it.

14:43.455 --> 14:45.718
And maybe the one good thing about Interleague players, they will,

14:45.850 --> 14:48.414
If Jumaati had lived, they'd have probably not heard of him.

14:48.434 --> 14:49.055
I know he wasn't.

14:49.075 --> 14:55.163
There was the greatest tragedy that hit Martin Baseball was the death of Jumaati.

14:55.183 --> 14:55.624
I don't know.

14:55.684 --> 14:59.069
I mean, he was marvelous for us intellectuals verbally.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.813
I'm not sure he was as much of a leader.

15:01.853 --> 15:03.636
He was powerful in that respect.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.660
The only good thing about that strike is that

15:06.944 --> 15:10.289
Texas was going to make the playoffs and they were an under 500 team.

15:10.449 --> 15:12.572
Wouldn't that have been something?

15:12.612 --> 15:13.813
Okay, here's your trivia question.

15:13.854 --> 15:16.637
What's the lowest percentage that ever got in the World Series?

15:17.378 --> 15:17.959
I couldn't answer it.

15:18.340 --> 15:18.680
73 Mets.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.863
They were one game over 500.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.367
One game over 500.

15:23.387 --> 15:25.149
It's hard to do with only two divisions.

15:25.189 --> 15:26.150
Four or three.

15:26.511 --> 15:27.713
With a wild card.

15:27.773 --> 15:28.994
Oh, no, it's easy.

15:29.014 --> 15:30.416
We're going to get under 500.

15:30.436 --> 15:35.263
The Mets were one game above 500 because the whole Eastern Division of the National League in 73 was so terrible.

15:35.547 --> 15:38.650
And they lost the series pretty quickly, so they deserved it.

15:38.670 --> 15:45.195
Getting back to museums, which you write about in this book, I love museums.

15:45.215 --> 15:46.677
I love the whole concept of them.

15:46.957 --> 15:51.020
And maybe you could just talk a little bit about your feeling about museums.

15:51.641 --> 16:03.832
The main point I hit in the book is that I don't like the way... There's such a... Let me just see.

16:03.852 --> 16:04.272
I'm sorry.

16:04.758 --> 16:11.185
There's such a temptation if you're running a museum to consider only bottom lines.

16:11.205 --> 16:12.387
It's just the nature of business.

16:12.407 --> 16:24.560
Now, I don't want anybody to go bankrupt, so I'm not going to... I'm enough of a realist that there's nothing to do to preserve your institution and do something that's a little morally suspect.

16:24.721 --> 16:28.845
As long as it isn't too morally suspect, that may not be what I wouldn't choose to be in the business.

16:30.427 --> 16:32.149
But what museums are doing...

16:33.277 --> 16:56.888
is basically to turn themselves into theme parks a lot of them and it just won't work they will get more bodies in because people love theme parks that is take out specimens i'm just a few specimens put in a lot of computer screens a lot of things that move a lot of buttons to press a lot of hokey flashing lights kids love them they pack them in you get a big gift shop you make a lot of t-shirts and coffee mugs look i hate to

16:58.167 --> 17:06.715
be negative towards local institutions, but I'll never forget when the Museum of Science, which I love in its own way, they spent years raising money for this new wing.

17:06.735 --> 17:07.756
They didn't do anything else.

17:07.796 --> 17:08.517
What did they put in it?

17:09.358 --> 17:11.940
A restaurant, a gift shop, and an omnimax theater.

17:11.980 --> 17:12.961
It's all that's in there.

17:13.702 --> 17:15.283
You know, that's crazy.

17:15.323 --> 17:21.509
The point is, we can't compete with theme parks on their own terms.

17:21.569 --> 17:25.693
And I say this as someone who doesn't hate, I'm not one of these

17:26.045 --> 17:28.809
Ivory Tower intellectuals, I love theme parks.

17:29.129 --> 17:31.072
They're just different from museums.

17:31.092 --> 17:35.478
The theme parks are a place where you're supposed to entertain and be at the height of technology.

17:35.498 --> 17:36.400
It's very exciting.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.162
And if you teach a little bit, that's great.

17:38.342 --> 17:39.444
I love the Disney World.

17:39.524 --> 17:40.325
I adore it.

17:40.605 --> 17:41.467
But it is what it is.

17:41.967 --> 17:47.055
Museums are places where you're supposed to display authentic specimens of nature and teach people.

17:47.936 --> 17:51.040
And if you turn your museum into a theme park, there's more people who come in.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.943
You're going to be lost in this never-never land.

17:52.963 --> 17:54.505
You destroy your own integrity.

17:54.785 --> 17:55.967
You'll never be as good.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.762
It's the real theme park, so you don't have the resources or the money.

17:59.042 --> 18:04.434
But the best example are these stupid dinosaur models that growl.

18:04.494 --> 18:14.837
First of all, they have no scientific content because the only things that are exciting about them, namely their sounds and their colors, are the things we absolutely know nothing about.

18:14.877 --> 18:16.420
So that's all guesswork.

18:16.703 --> 18:19.987
Now, I don't even, again, I'm not a purist.

18:20.527 --> 18:29.837
If you use those silly model dinosaurs, if you put them in your own dinosaur hall and you use them as a device for getting people in to see the real dinosaurs, okay, I'll live with that.

18:29.897 --> 18:30.538
I don't love it.

18:31.219 --> 18:37.225
But too often that's not done because, you see, they put them in a separate place because they charge separate admission to it.

18:37.245 --> 18:38.847
There have been some stories.

18:38.907 --> 18:39.668
I tell one in there.

18:39.688 --> 18:43.572
There was one university that shall remain nameless which brought in these tech

18:43.889 --> 18:50.418
dinosaurs in order to, they said, bring people into their own museum, but then they found they didn't fit.

18:50.438 --> 18:57.328
So they ended up putting them in a building on the other side of campus, and fewer people went to the real museum as a result.

18:57.949 --> 18:58.469
I won't use it.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.973
It's Michigan, but you can't.

19:01.013 --> 19:03.356
I'd love to know.

19:03.837 --> 19:06.841
Have you read Lawrence Weschler's new book, or Mr. Wilson's calendar?

19:06.981 --> 19:08.043
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.264
Cute little concept.

19:09.284 --> 19:09.745
Yeah, yeah, it is.

19:10.163 --> 19:17.971
I knew about Jurassic, the Jurassic Museum, because my colleague, Rosie Purcell, had been there.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.494
So I actually knew, but it's a nice little book.

19:20.734 --> 19:28.503
I mean, he's marvelous because he's so arch, the guy who runs that thing, because he talks so serious about the things he makes up, and some of them are true.

19:28.683 --> 19:36.912
I reviewed that book for the Washington Post, and I put in, you know, because the whole thing here is, could it be true, right?

19:36.932 --> 19:37.032
Well,

19:37.417 --> 19:38.479
Oh, there is such a museum.

19:38.639 --> 19:40.483
Yeah, but I mean that even some of the stuff.

19:40.503 --> 19:41.765
Some of the stuff is true.

19:41.845 --> 19:45.572
You're not supposed to give away special effects for the movie.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.956
I did that.

19:47.976 --> 19:50.320
A few of the things he has in this museum are absolutely true.

19:50.340 --> 19:55.189
What's marvelous about him is he's the true postmodern museum director.

19:55.473 --> 19:58.964
He makes no distinction between truth and falsity.

19:58.984 --> 20:03.600
And he's so carefully true about some of them, to be honest, he talks the same way.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.004
That's a wonderful setup.

20:05.446 --> 20:08.335
But the problem is that you really have to

20:09.142 --> 20:13.529
know museums and the tradition to really see what he's doing, and I don't know how many people get it.

20:13.689 --> 20:16.253
Well, the Wunderkammer explains that.

20:16.273 --> 20:17.395
Yes, no, the Wunderkammer.

20:17.435 --> 20:21.702
Look, I'm a sort of specialist on the Wunderkammer tradition with Rosie.

20:21.922 --> 20:24.186
I have my antiquarian books in New York, so they're not here.

20:24.206 --> 20:28.252
I can show you some, but I actually have a collection of the books of the old Wunderkammer.

20:28.693 --> 20:31.297
Now, of course, with the Wunderkammer, they had a different aesthetic.

20:31.417 --> 20:34.322
I mean, they thought they were getting things that were true,

20:34.589 --> 20:39.835
But of course, because they didn't distinguish well between the fable and fact, they ended up with things that are fables.

20:39.895 --> 20:42.517
The Jurassic guy has a whole different notion.

20:42.537 --> 20:49.865
He ends up with something like a Olympic comic, but he's got different motors.

20:50.886 --> 20:56.312
I love that book with Rosie that you did, Find His Keeper.

20:56.332 --> 20:58.314
Yeah, that just kind of fell between the cracks.

20:58.334 --> 21:01.778
That's one of my one commercial failure, but it's a success in this theme.

21:01.758 --> 21:02.840
Oh, it's nice.

21:03.341 --> 21:07.467
In fact, I was going to put it in a bibliography of my own book, but I really didn't do it book collecting.

21:07.507 --> 21:08.829
I did a book collecting.

21:09.250 --> 21:09.891
What's your book?

21:09.991 --> 21:11.193
It's A Gentle Madness.

21:11.213 --> 21:12.615
It's about bibliomania.

21:12.635 --> 21:15.159
It was shortlisted for the NBCC yesterday.

21:15.179 --> 21:15.860
Oh, good.

21:16.241 --> 21:17.904
I haven't seen it.

21:17.924 --> 21:20.328
It's got the Durer engraving on the book.

21:20.368 --> 21:23.473
Oh, is that the one that Smithsonian did?

21:23.493 --> 21:24.174
No, Holt.

21:24.194 --> 21:24.695
Holt did it.

21:24.855 --> 21:25.896
But it's a big format.

21:25.997 --> 21:27.880
No, no, it's a regular book book.

21:27.980 --> 21:28.801
I don't know.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.402
I'd like to see it.

21:29.804 --> 21:32.326
Make sure you get a copy, because I'm actually working on it.

21:32.346 --> 21:33.808
Is that book collecting?

21:33.828 --> 21:35.970
It's about, yeah, it's about book collecting, really.

21:36.951 --> 21:56.790
Well, I am doing a proposal for my next book, and there is a chapter that, I will get this on tape for you, but I'm thinking about, I would love to include maybe you in this, Maurice Sendak in it, Umberto Eco, and how your things, you know, do they actually,

21:57.057 --> 22:20.685
enter into the creative process oh i use my yes no you see i'm not a collector for collecting sake uh although i love books i will only buy things and spend money on things that i might use and i know about half my essays come out of the books in my own library so i really use them also i'm now living in new york and i'm an absolutely wonderful library the soho loft so you ought to come down and see well is this something that's worth pursuing do you think how these

22:21.307 --> 22:24.732
I mean, with Echo, it's absolutely true.

22:24.812 --> 22:26.154
Unbelievable.

22:26.174 --> 22:27.096
Did you read his latest book?

22:27.256 --> 22:28.738
Oh, I did.

22:28.758 --> 22:29.520
He's a beautiful writer.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.503
Weaver is a wonderful translator.

22:31.543 --> 22:33.986
Weaver is a great translator.

22:34.006 --> 22:37.331
It's a wonderful, he's a magnificent translator.

22:37.372 --> 22:38.233
He deserves it.

22:38.413 --> 22:42.960
I've looked at the original Italian to some of them, which I read, and he's just, you know, to capture

22:44.577 --> 22:45.519
I didn't capture that.

22:45.579 --> 22:48.546
In English, it's as good as the Italians.

22:48.627 --> 22:49.529
I don't know him, but he is.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.854
I don't think people really appreciate him.

22:51.874 --> 22:53.097
He's won a lot of prizes, doesn't he?

22:53.117 --> 22:53.538
Yeah, he has.

22:53.579 --> 22:54.100
Everyone knows.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.744
He's clearly the great translator.

22:55.764 --> 23:01.337
And he's one of the few people who, the translator, who gets almost the same size of type on the

23:01.553 --> 23:05.659
I mean, I would buy a book.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.562
I think he did Calvino, didn't he do?

23:07.583 --> 23:08.143
Probably.

23:08.163 --> 23:14.974
But I'll tell you, the thing is, I saw Invento a few years, and he said, you're going to love my third book.

23:15.475 --> 23:22.125
I think The Name of the Rose, and I know not everybody, but I think The Name of the Rose is the finest book I've read in the last 20 years.

23:22.466 --> 23:25.030
It's got depth that people never saw.

23:25.212 --> 23:27.916
The problem is you've got to know all the languages he knows.

23:28.256 --> 23:30.099
Maybe I get one reference in five.

23:30.139 --> 23:32.943
I think I get a lot more than most people because my mind works the way he does.

23:33.584 --> 23:38.030
But he writes his book so carefully, so if you don't get any of his references, you can still, it doesn't matter.

23:38.151 --> 23:45.061
For instance, this latest book, the first 300 pages are magnificent, but very few readers are going to know what it's about.

23:45.101 --> 23:55.135
What it's really about is the transition from the Neoplatonic to the mechanical worldview, which I think is the greatest conceptual transformation for science in the history of Western thought.

23:55.368 --> 24:07.249
He captures that beautifully, the contrast between the Jesuit and the... But then the last 200 pages are lost in this reverie about the difference between fiction and fact, which just doesn't interest me as much as literary theory.

24:07.289 --> 24:19.671
But the first part, no one has written... I mean, if you know Athanasius Kierke, who's the prototype of his Jesuit, who was the last great Jesuit Neoplatonist, who in the 17th century was as famous as Newton, but has been forgotten because his worldview's gone.

24:20.140 --> 24:25.292
And you see what, that book is brilliant, but nobody's going to get it.

24:25.312 --> 24:34.693
But I think his genius is such that it still offers its rewards for millions of other readers, and if they get it, terrific.

24:34.733 --> 24:36.457
How many serious readers are there in the world?

24:36.497 --> 24:37.660
I mean, I've heard the number of maybe...

24:37.842 --> 24:40.786
50,000 in the United States.

24:41.727 --> 24:41.948
Yeah.

24:41.968 --> 24:46.053
But the problem with that book, as opposed to the name of the rose, there isn't much more than his allusion.

24:46.073 --> 24:46.874
Yeah.

24:46.894 --> 24:47.335
Allusion.

24:47.415 --> 24:50.119
There isn't enough story, and that's why it's not going to do as well.

24:50.139 --> 24:56.728
But he told me, you know, the story of how he actually had this book, you know, in his library for the name of the rose, and it was up there.

24:57.189 --> 24:58.170
Which one?

24:58.190 --> 24:59.131
In his library.

24:59.191 --> 24:59.792
What the hell was it?

24:59.852 --> 25:05.340
It was an Aristotle that he picked up for like nothing at a flea market.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.663
That was years earlier, and he found it.

25:07.981 --> 25:16.150
And he said, and it was ugly, but it was old, and it was distasteful, but maybe this thing was there, you know.

25:16.210 --> 25:24.459
Plus, he said he's been pressed in jeopardy of having his apartments collapse under the weight of these 25,000 books.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.242
But I think he'd be really very, very good.

25:27.302 --> 25:32.728
And Sendak's collection, you know, of Melville stuff and everything.

25:32.769 --> 25:35.912
And now he did this Pierre book, but his collection is said to be

25:36.213 --> 25:36.874
Absolutely.

25:36.934 --> 25:37.875
I guess I have heard that.

25:38.195 --> 25:40.578
Mine is idiosyncratic, but it's good.

25:40.758 --> 25:45.644
Yeah, but I really see your, you know, this is not just science.

25:45.805 --> 25:52.112
You have an antiquarian sense, I think, which, and also a very humanistic sense, which comes through.

25:52.172 --> 25:57.178
And I have to believe that these things that you gather, talk to me about things.

25:57.218 --> 26:00.562
I mean, do you have a passion for things as artifacts?

26:00.623 --> 26:01.444
Not really.

26:01.484 --> 26:02.064
I used to.

26:02.104 --> 26:04.347
When I was a kid, I was a very...

26:04.816 --> 26:07.080
avid collector of everything kids collect.

26:07.120 --> 26:12.027
I started my stamp collection, my coin collection, my matchbook collection.

26:12.068 --> 26:13.109
I collected everything.

26:13.730 --> 26:26.070
But, you know, when I came here in 1967, I came here with the six boxes of fossils that I'd painfully collected all my life, and I was curator of 15,000 drawers of fossils.

26:26.110 --> 26:27.192
That killed it.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.394
And it absolutely killed it.

26:28.434 --> 26:31.819
I believe in accumulation, but I just don't believe private people.

26:32.272 --> 26:34.275
should have it just for their delectation.

26:34.335 --> 26:36.177
I mean, I don't have a moral objection to this.

26:36.197 --> 26:37.619
It's just nothing I would choose to do.

26:37.919 --> 26:39.522
I collect books because I use them.

26:40.002 --> 26:44.508
I don't actually believe in private collecting merely for collection's sake.

26:44.548 --> 26:49.695
I don't object to anyone who does it, but I believe in public collecting in public's sake.

26:49.715 --> 26:56.003
Do you get a feeling, though, when you pick up something that's, like if you pick up, I don't know, a First Copernicus?

26:56.024 --> 26:56.584
Oh, sure.

26:56.644 --> 26:58.667
That you get it.

26:58.816 --> 27:04.662
Oh, absolutely, and I will do anything, whenever I try to work from originals, even if they're facsimiles.

27:04.742 --> 27:05.403
Oh, yeah, that's good.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.666
Oh, yeah, no, just, you're absolutely right.

27:07.766 --> 27:14.313
That's why museums will not fail, and that is why the theme park shouldn't take over from the museum.

27:14.333 --> 27:20.640
Fortunately, for some internal reason that I don't understand, authenticity stirs the human soul.

27:20.680 --> 27:28.148
You know, my favorite story I tell in one of those essays, but I'll repeat it, it's a great story, it's just, it's true.

27:28.972 --> 27:31.356
former director of the Air and Space Museum told me this.

27:31.396 --> 27:36.603
They had a group of blind visitors in one day for a consultation on how to make the museum more accessible.

27:36.984 --> 27:40.669
And you know, they have all the major planes hung from the ceiling in the Great Hall.

27:40.769 --> 27:41.711
Lindbergh Spirit of St.

27:41.751 --> 27:42.572
Louis is there.

27:42.592 --> 27:45.897
I don't think there's some interesting story about the Wright Brothers plane.

27:46.077 --> 27:48.401
Yeah, maybe they can finally get it back.

27:48.421 --> 27:50.083
Well, it was eight years ago.

27:50.123 --> 27:50.944
I don't know.

27:51.325 --> 27:51.465
Yeah.

27:51.525 --> 27:52.447
No, there was something interesting.

27:52.467 --> 27:54.810
You see the story about that is that Langley,

27:55.280 --> 28:11.074
the director of the Smithsonian at the turn of the century, was also a pretender, in the old sense of maintaining, not faking, to patents on early flight, and he and the Wright brothers had a terrible spat, so they didn't, I think they eventually got the plane.

28:11.134 --> 28:24.105
But anyway, because these planes are sitting there inaccessible to the blind, the director explained to this group of visitors that it really wasn't anything, that was the only place he could hang them, and he realized that was a problem, and he was, he

28:24.254 --> 28:26.899
He was wondering if there's anything they could do to make the situation better.

28:26.919 --> 28:31.809
So he said, would it help, for example, if we made a model of the spirit of St.

28:31.929 --> 28:32.310
Louis?

28:33.051 --> 28:36.658
And Scott visited his caucus, and they came back with the most wonderful answer.

28:36.678 --> 28:41.628
They said, yes, that would be very helpful, but you have to place it right under the original.

28:42.349 --> 28:43.050
Isn't that wonderful?

28:43.070 --> 28:44.473
They can't perceive it.

28:45.145 --> 28:46.246
It's just the knowledge.

28:46.306 --> 28:47.568
See, it's an intellectual thing.

28:47.648 --> 28:49.490
It's not, or it's a visceral thing.

28:49.811 --> 28:50.592
But it's in the head.

28:50.632 --> 28:57.720
It's the knowledge that this model is underneath the absolutely unperceivable original, makes it meaningful.

28:57.740 --> 29:02.366
That's why museums are going to survive, because people love authentic objects as they should.

29:02.706 --> 29:04.808
Now, you see the Rosetta Stone in the British Museum.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.751
It's no better than its replicas.

29:06.831 --> 29:07.912
I can't tell the difference.

29:08.233 --> 29:10.896
But I know that's the stone that Champollion read.

29:10.976 --> 29:14.460
I know that's the... I describe in my book, when I went to see William Scheide,

29:14.744 --> 29:20.072
His private collection is at the Firestone Library.

29:20.092 --> 29:20.373
It is.

29:20.473 --> 29:22.295
I mean, he chooses not to give it.

29:22.736 --> 29:23.017
Fine.

29:23.457 --> 29:31.189
And he goes to his... I didn't realize that when you are writing, you do really write.

29:31.750 --> 29:32.070
Always.

29:32.331 --> 29:35.455
And you do feel that that has an effect.

29:35.596 --> 29:38.440
Oh, and in many cases, of course, there's no alternative.

29:39.297 --> 29:42.661
16th, 17th century Latin treatises in natural history.

29:42.721 --> 29:45.184
There are no translations, there are no facsimiles.

29:45.665 --> 29:51.072
I mean, if you want to read, you know, Scheutz's Physica Sacre, you've got to read it.

29:51.152 --> 29:52.313
There's nothing else.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.737
This is not for this piece, and I'll tell you, by the way, later who I write for.

29:55.757 --> 29:56.498
Yeah, okay.

29:56.538 --> 29:57.399
And what's your schedule?

29:57.439 --> 29:58.481
I've got to leave about 10.

29:58.641 --> 30:00.703
Okay, we'll get 15 minutes or so.

30:03.567 --> 30:05.229
Where was I going?

30:05.249 --> 30:06.891
I said this wasn't for this piece.

30:07.394 --> 30:08.615
come to it.

30:08.675 --> 30:31.218
So tell me then about, you know, this whole concept of evolution just seems that you never, it never tires, it never fails to... I don't think it ever will, because first of all, it's the focal concept of the biological sciences, so it is the one integrated concept in the whole enormous discipline.

30:31.699 --> 30:35.983
Also, it's a theory that's very rich, parts of it are controversial, not the

30:36.537 --> 30:37.458
basic stuff.

30:39.402 --> 30:40.724
It applies to everything.

30:40.804 --> 30:44.530
It has more social implications than any major scientific theory.

30:44.930 --> 30:50.419
And it applies to millions of fascinating animals and plants out there.

30:51.220 --> 30:51.601
I don't know.

30:51.621 --> 30:53.564
People ask me, how do you do this every month?

30:53.624 --> 30:54.726
It's no problem.

30:54.766 --> 30:57.550
Well, journalists don't ask me if they like every day, every week.

30:58.002 --> 31:06.933
But I'm not sure if my field was physics that you could sustain 50 monthly essays, because the theory is as rich in physics, but you don't have any objects.

31:06.953 --> 31:09.015
I think that's what keeps it going.

31:09.256 --> 31:12.139
You've got so many kinds of organisms.

31:12.159 --> 31:25.095
What do you feel when you say, I realize this is a different field, but when you see this picture that the Hubble takes, goes into this corner of space, and now they say, 50 billion more galaxies.

31:25.956 --> 31:27.638
It's just amazing how...

31:27.871 --> 31:29.233
It's totally insignificant.

31:29.253 --> 31:32.276
Everything and everybody is here.

31:32.296 --> 31:35.800
And I suppose there are parallels with what you can learn here on Earth.

31:35.981 --> 31:40.946
I don't know if that's a question or not.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.408
I just got a review copy.

31:42.428 --> 31:45.051
I totally ignored the hardcover work here.

31:45.091 --> 31:47.134
The paperback of the bell curve is up.

31:47.154 --> 31:47.894
Yeah, I know.

31:47.915 --> 31:49.917
I've got a revision of the Mismeasure of Man.

31:49.937 --> 31:51.599
It's coming out in a month or two.

31:51.619 --> 31:51.979
Really?

31:52.119 --> 31:57.726
Any comment that you can... I know you've talked about the bell curve in the past.

31:59.039 --> 32:02.966
It's a very long book about a very simple argument that's wrong.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.914
Does it offend you when you see it?

32:07.934 --> 32:08.275
Yeah.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.839
People are using it now as justifications for everything.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.382
No, it takes a lot of social harm.

32:12.442 --> 32:17.471
The argument, which I think is conclusively disproven, is no different.

32:18.252 --> 32:20.997
It's funny, when I revised The Mismeasure of Man,

32:21.179 --> 32:25.746
The revision has a long preface about the history of biology that turned in the last 20 years.

32:25.826 --> 32:33.619
I added five essays, three of which I haven't been republished before, so it's a new book in that sense, but I didn't alter the text at all.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.647
Now, this whole thing is a response to the bell curve, and I said, wait a minute, I wrote The Miss Measurement in 1984.

32:38.987 --> 32:44.796
How can I not alter the main text and claim that it's an answer to a book written in 1995?

32:45.357 --> 32:45.878
But it is.

32:46.519 --> 32:48.402
The point is that argument is,

32:48.905 --> 32:55.814
You see, The Mismeasure of Man is not, a lot of people misunderstand it, if you read it carefully, it's not a general attack on all biological determinants.

32:55.854 --> 33:00.861
It's a very specific book against the theory of unitary innate intelligence.

33:00.881 --> 33:07.951
That is the idea that intelligence can be abstracted as a single number, measuring an innate property that can't be altered substantially.

33:08.251 --> 33:09.753
And that's what the bell curve's about.

33:09.793 --> 33:10.895
They didn't add anything new.

33:11.455 --> 33:15.621
I wrote The Mismeasure of Man in 1984, but part of it was a response to...

33:16.293 --> 33:18.977
to the article Dick Harnstein had written in Atlantic Monthly in 1971.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.620
They didn't change anything in The Bell Curve.

33:21.640 --> 33:30.232
So in a funny sense, even though it's anachronistic, The Mismeasure of Man published ten years before The Bell Curve is the answer to The Bell Curve, because it's the same argument.

33:30.252 --> 33:31.574
And I did think of the other question.

33:31.614 --> 33:34.337
I mean, we are approaching the millennium.

33:34.558 --> 33:36.420
We've written about it often.

33:36.801 --> 33:40.686
My next book is going to be, I hope, to be a continuum.

33:40.726 --> 33:41.507
I'm going to go look at it.

33:42.466 --> 33:56.170
go to these great shrines like the Library of Pergamum and just carry it forward and then maybe spend a couple weeks in Seattle to where they're proposing what books of the future are going to be like.

33:56.190 --> 34:01.179
Do you have any anxiety about the future of the book as we know it?

34:01.259 --> 34:04.885
I'm not a great futurist and I still type on a typewriter, as you know.

34:05.767 --> 34:07.630
I just

34:08.707 --> 34:14.317
somehow think that the book will survive, at least into the immediate future, pretty much in its current form.

34:15.038 --> 34:18.304
There are more and more people, people don't like to read screams.

34:18.404 --> 34:24.635
You can't take them to bed, you can't take them on the bus, you can't, oh, I suppose fancy things can happen.

34:24.675 --> 34:32.689
Maybe we'll get books with holographic and moving images, which are cute and all that, but I think people like books.

34:33.074 --> 34:34.937
And I don't think they've got to stop liking them.

34:34.957 --> 34:43.011
The parallel I make, and I cut myself badly shaving this morning, is that, you know, remember when electric shavers came in, we were all going to get rid of our... Yeah.

34:43.893 --> 34:45.255
Never happened, right?

34:45.275 --> 34:46.818
So, I mean, this is the perfect example.

34:46.858 --> 34:48.501
That is a great example.

34:48.818 --> 34:50.741
Wet shaver's never been more popular.

34:50.801 --> 34:52.743
I mean, who would use an electric shaver?

34:52.763 --> 34:53.865
Yeah, it's crazy.

34:53.905 --> 34:56.008
Good old Gillette technology is good.

34:56.048 --> 35:01.635
When I take a laptop to bed, don't you love to pick up a binding, an old book?

35:01.815 --> 35:06.822
I have a cabinet at home, all old books, and when you open it, it's just... Yeah, it won't go away.

35:06.842 --> 35:07.583
It's not going to go away.

35:07.603 --> 35:09.345
It's like nectar the way it comes out.

35:09.366 --> 35:11.248
I don't have too much anxiety.

35:11.228 --> 35:13.070
At least for the near future.

35:13.150 --> 35:16.855
How about the digitization of all this information and images and stuff?

35:17.616 --> 35:21.901
Well, I see a lot of wonderful friends at the National Museum of American Art in Washington.

35:21.941 --> 35:26.627
They are doing a project to put onâget this, this would never be done before.

35:27.228 --> 35:29.250
I happen to like Civil War statuary.

35:29.290 --> 35:33.595
I don't think it'sâit's not that it's good artistically, it's just so wrenching historically.

35:33.656 --> 35:37.320
Every little town in America has a Civil War statue on the green, right?

35:37.553 --> 35:39.940
They're doing a project where they're going to take photographs of every one of these.

35:40.000 --> 35:40.742
Isn't that wonderful?

35:40.762 --> 35:41.484
Isn't that marvelous?

35:41.504 --> 35:42.768
You could not do that before.

35:42.788 --> 35:43.911
You couldn't do it in a book.

35:44.453 --> 35:48.966
There's thousands and thousands and thousands of them, and most of them aren't worth that much.

35:49.226 --> 35:50.711
But that happened in one place?

35:50.731 --> 35:50.871
Sure.

35:51.357 --> 35:55.322
And even eventually to have it into technology where you can walk around it and really... Oh, that's good.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.886
Gates buys up all the Barnes, the Whites.

35:58.006 --> 35:58.306
Right.

35:58.326 --> 36:00.329
And you can't even get in to see those paintings.

36:00.369 --> 36:01.731
If you're in Philly, they make it hard.

36:01.951 --> 36:10.463
There's nothing like seeing the original, but to have a disc that has every painting in the Hermitage, which not everybody can get to every day.

36:11.337 --> 36:14.362
I tried to get to the Vermeer, you know, over Christmas with my kids.

36:14.382 --> 36:15.864
They're going to close it down.

36:15.944 --> 36:16.425
Right, yeah.

36:19.189 --> 36:20.932
Thanks a lot.

36:20.972 --> 36:24.477
I called, I got press passes because the tickets were impossible.

36:24.537 --> 36:28.423
I do all that, and I still can't get this.

36:28.604 --> 36:36.636
I brought over three of my English friends who came to visit me in January, a once-in-a-lifetime thing in New York.

36:36.920 --> 36:40.124
Couldn't get to the Statue of Liberty in Ellis Island, which they wanted to see.

36:40.164 --> 36:40.845
Couldn't get there.

36:41.285 --> 36:42.287
There's plenty else to do.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.648
You mentioned Civil War statues.

36:43.668 --> 36:47.774
You know, there's one in Martha's Vineyard of a Confederate soldier, which is amazing.

36:47.794 --> 36:48.154
Where is it?

36:48.635 --> 36:49.416
Right in Oak Bluffs.

36:49.996 --> 36:53.601
And I forget what the reasoning is for that.

36:53.621 --> 36:55.463
But no, it's very, very interesting.

36:55.483 --> 36:57.886
I mean, that's the only one I think you'll find in the North, you know.

36:58.227 --> 37:01.150
And they've even painted it.

37:01.190 --> 37:02.632
It's gray, you know.

37:02.833 --> 37:04.174
I mean, I hope they get this in there.

37:04.314 --> 37:05.316
It's a peculiarity.

37:05.596 --> 37:06.437
Yeah.

37:06.535 --> 37:08.417
I know you've got a 10 o'clock gig.

37:08.677 --> 37:13.503
Is it possible for me to contact you down the line about this next book?

37:13.523 --> 37:15.826
I'll be happy to send you a copy of my book if you'd like this.

37:16.246 --> 37:17.067
It's a lot of fun.

37:17.588 --> 37:31.643
The irony is that Agassiz, who was the last great scientific creationist, opened this building the same year that Darwin published The Origin of Species.

37:31.664 --> 37:35.648
This is the first edition, the original building and the four rooms in that direction.

37:36.050 --> 37:42.096
And this obviously was an exhibit hall, so we were going to paint this years ago, and they washed the walls.

37:42.117 --> 37:42.677
Oh, I wouldn't know.

37:42.697 --> 37:43.098
No, no.

37:43.158 --> 37:46.782
They washed the walls down, and this writing emerged, and I wouldn't let them paint, which is great.

37:46.862 --> 37:47.783
It saved me a lot of time.

37:48.343 --> 37:53.008
So I never realized until they had done that that this was one of the original... Is that right?

37:53.028 --> 37:55.671
Isn't that great?

37:55.691 --> 38:00.556
Nice.

38:00.576 --> 38:05.922
So he lays for the arms that he was going to put into a formal...
