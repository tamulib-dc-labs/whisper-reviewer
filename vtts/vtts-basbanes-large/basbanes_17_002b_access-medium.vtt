00:03.490 --> 00:07.020
WRC AM 980.

00:07.692 --> 00:17.807
Ladies and gentlemen, AM 980, WRC, the talk station, presents the Mike Cuthbert Show with your host, Mike Cuthbert.

00:17.827 --> 00:28.122
News with John Megley, WRC all-day traffic, weather from the Weather Channel, and your participation at 202-882-WRC1.

00:28.563 --> 00:33.790
Free mobile calls at Star WRC on Bell Atlantic and pound 980 on Cellular One.

00:34.131 --> 00:35.573
Get on the line now.

00:44.767 --> 00:45.668
Good morning, everybody.

00:45.688 --> 00:48.351
1109 here at WRC, and our phones are open.

00:48.392 --> 00:53.578
They soon probably will be filled, so call early for the book guy, Alan Stipek, who's here.

00:54.259 --> 01:06.895
He makes his, well, I suppose every two months we try to have Alan on because, first of all, he gives lots of you a lot of good value, and second of all, as all my friends say and some of my enemies when they meet me, you know that guy, every time he's on, I think, ah, books.

01:07.335 --> 01:12.141
But I always learn something I never knew before about either books or literature or history or something.

01:12.121 --> 01:13.263
That's strange.

01:13.283 --> 01:14.445
You never know what's going to happen.

01:14.886 --> 01:15.988
So, Alan, welcome to you.

01:16.209 --> 01:16.650
Morning, Mike.

01:16.930 --> 01:17.491
How's business?

01:17.672 --> 01:19.115
Business is fine, as usual.

01:19.936 --> 01:21.319
Let's give you the ground rules.

01:22.100 --> 01:30.737
For Alan Stipek from Second Story Books, he is the owner, manager, founder, and major domo of the largest, I suppose the largest,

01:30.717 --> 01:32.680
bookstore of its kind on the East Coast.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.283
He's got his fingers into tentacles all over.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.084
Close, right, Al?

01:36.104 --> 01:36.304
Close.

01:36.424 --> 01:37.165
Okay.

01:37.185 --> 01:38.207
Oh, a little hyperbole.

01:38.227 --> 01:38.687
Never heard.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.229
Who's going to argue with us?

01:40.249 --> 01:42.432
I'm not accused of that.

01:42.452 --> 01:48.160
What he's going to do for you is he's got his basic resource materials here, and they'll take him as far as it'll go.

01:48.180 --> 01:54.548
If you have a book in your home, in your attic, in your basement, in your collection, as we did the other day, I'd

01:54.528 --> 01:57.172
picked his brain when he stopped by the house for a purpose.

01:58.594 --> 02:00.877
You're just curious, is this worth anything?

02:01.218 --> 02:01.919
We'll find out.

02:02.379 --> 02:13.416
In our case, it happened to be a Nellie Melba collection of things from Australia during World War I for the Belgian Relief Fund, filled with color plates, everything, and as Alan said, enjoy reading it.

02:13.436 --> 02:15.118
You're not going to make a lot of money on it.

02:15.098 --> 02:19.944
But if you have such a book, please, if you can, bring it to the phone with you when you call.

02:20.004 --> 02:25.070
If you're in your car, at least take enough time to remember as much as you can about the book.

02:25.230 --> 02:27.953
Title, publisher, year, so forth.

02:28.313 --> 02:31.417
And give us a call at 202-882-WRC1.

02:31.958 --> 02:33.519
Star WRC on Bell Atlantic.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.303
Cellular 1 is pound 980.

02:36.403 --> 02:38.505
And call us and we'll see if it's worth anything.

02:39.186 --> 02:40.868
Any breaks in the market these days?

02:40.948 --> 02:44.312
Anything suddenly popping up is worth more than it usually is?

02:44.427 --> 02:45.328
Not really.

02:45.408 --> 02:47.030
Everything is constant.

02:47.310 --> 02:54.098
We're involved in selling a lot of autographs at the present time, and I'm very surprised at the strength of the autograph market.

02:54.799 --> 02:59.864
We're handling an estate of a man who was the personal assistant to Harry Truman.

03:00.345 --> 03:07.853
He's a 94-year-old gentleman living in Florida, and we have all the White House telephone logs from that time period, which...

03:07.833 --> 03:14.781
We're going to be giving to the Harry Truman Library, but it's really been a gas reading who Harry Truman was talking to at 3.30 in the morning on Sunday.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.003
He never called Paul Hume.

03:17.024 --> 03:17.985
I know he wrote him a letter.

03:18.205 --> 03:21.208
The phone calls to Joseph Stalin are interesting.

03:22.089 --> 03:24.512
Our number again, 202882 WRC1.

03:24.532 --> 03:28.016
We're going to help you with anything concerning a book that is not new.

03:28.457 --> 03:30.078
Let's go to James first.

03:30.118 --> 03:31.140
You're on WRC.

03:31.180 --> 03:31.620
Good morning.

03:31.941 --> 03:32.421
Good morning.

03:32.661 --> 03:36.346
I have been looking for a book that I had and lost many years ago.

03:36.366 --> 03:37.587
It was first published in our...

03:37.567 --> 03:42.075
late thirties and republished in the sixties called the knack of selling yourself

03:42.595 --> 03:50.448
And just a wealth of wisdom, things that you do in the world to succeed in business.

03:50.829 --> 03:51.930
Have you ever heard of this?

03:51.951 --> 03:53.273
Sure, it's a self-promotion book.

03:53.814 --> 03:55.957
There are a lot of books in that category right now.

03:56.698 --> 03:59.163
Pop Psych Self-Help is a major industry.

03:59.203 --> 04:03.790
There's an author, Ogmandino, who writes books on self-help.

04:03.950 --> 04:08.518
I know the shelves are full of them, but this one particular one is the one I want.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.481
It's not difficult.

04:09.541 --> 04:19.466
You could contact our Rockville location, Second Story Books, and ask for our search service and we could probably obtain a book for you between three and six weeks if we don't have it on the shelf.

04:19.486 --> 04:19.667
Oh, good.

04:19.687 --> 04:24.178
And you can reach us there at 301-770-0477.

04:24.496 --> 04:26.238
Okay, thank you very much.

04:26.258 --> 04:26.598
Thank you.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.660
The knack of selling yourself, eh?

04:28.860 --> 04:30.862
That's what we're doing here, aren't we?

04:30.882 --> 04:32.984
Dorothy, you're on WRC.

04:33.025 --> 04:33.525
Good morning.

04:34.346 --> 04:34.786
Good morning.

04:34.987 --> 04:35.567
Yes.

04:35.887 --> 04:38.190
Hi, I have a couple of old books that I have here.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.471
I don't know if they're worth anything.

04:40.232 --> 04:43.055
And one is called Lyman's Historical Charts.

04:43.815 --> 04:48.960
And I think this was written back in the, well, it went into Congress in 1873.

04:49.101 --> 04:53.665
It's about a lot of charts, I guess, common logical charts.

04:53.685 --> 04:54.486
What kind of charts, ma'am?

04:55.023 --> 04:57.167
I guess you would call them chronological charts.

04:57.507 --> 04:57.928
Oh, okay.

04:57.948 --> 04:58.549
Historically?

04:58.890 --> 05:00.272
Historical chronological?

05:00.292 --> 05:01.434
Historically, yeah.

05:01.454 --> 05:01.714
Yeah.

05:02.015 --> 05:03.137
Is it a big fold-out?

05:03.517 --> 05:06.422
It's a great big old looking green book.

05:06.442 --> 05:13.093
Yeah, I mean, but are the charts in the book, would they fold out or are they just like a regular book and page by page shows it?

05:13.114 --> 05:14.356
It's like a regular book.

05:14.376 --> 05:15.578
It's page by page.

05:15.618 --> 05:16.980
So leatherback or hardback?

05:17.129 --> 05:18.070
It's a hardback.

05:18.130 --> 05:18.931
I mean, leatherback?

05:19.151 --> 05:20.892
It's been leather-bound.

05:20.912 --> 05:22.033
It's kind of old and rusty.

05:22.434 --> 05:30.301
Depending on the extent of the work on each of the charts, it could be a book I could sell for $20 to $50.

05:31.222 --> 05:39.189
Some of the interesting chart books from that time period have these humongous fold-out charts that go for 20 or 30 feet showing the chronological history of the world.

05:39.629 --> 05:44.394
We had one in the store that we were going to use for support when we were buying antiquities.

05:44.694 --> 05:47.136
The problem is we didn't have a room large enough to house it.

05:47.116 --> 05:50.421
Okay, because this one goes back just before biblical times.

05:50.682 --> 05:51.363
Right.

05:51.443 --> 05:52.384
Is that it?

05:52.444 --> 05:53.326
That's one of the books.

05:53.386 --> 05:57.573
I mean, these books were used in schools, you know, as educational aids.

05:57.593 --> 05:58.795
Educational things, yes.

05:58.815 --> 06:01.579
And this one is called Scenes from Every Land.

06:01.599 --> 06:01.779
Right.

06:01.799 --> 06:03.522
And this goes back in the 1800s.

06:04.345 --> 06:05.707
Scenes from Every Land?

06:06.207 --> 06:07.068
That's what it says.

06:07.088 --> 06:07.789
Okay.

06:07.809 --> 06:09.150
And that's a leatherback book also?

06:09.771 --> 06:10.051
Yes, it is.

06:10.071 --> 06:10.272
Okay.

06:10.292 --> 06:15.778
I would imagine that book, does it have plates or woodcuts in it?

06:15.798 --> 06:16.799
How do you mean plates?

06:16.959 --> 06:17.280
It has pictures.

06:17.300 --> 06:17.920
It has pictures.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.564
Are they like steel engravings or color engravings?

06:21.604 --> 06:24.468
No, it's engraving.

06:24.488 --> 06:25.729
It's kind of grayish black, I guess you would call it.

06:25.749 --> 06:29.273
Yeah, but do you know the difference between a steel engraving and a woodcut?

06:29.793 --> 06:30.214
Okay.

06:30.234 --> 06:35.801
A steel engraving would be, actually, you could feel the texture of the steel engraving on the page.

06:35.841 --> 06:36.562
It would be different.

06:36.702 --> 06:39.526
It would be raised a little.

06:40.207 --> 06:40.307
Yeah.

06:40.327 --> 06:40.968
They're woodcuts.

06:41.409 --> 06:41.990
I would imagine.

06:42.010 --> 06:49.540
I mean, books like that sell anywhere, again, from the $20 to $50 area if it's an octavo book, which is a relatively large book.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.468
What about the Bibles in the 1800s?

06:53.390 --> 06:58.839
Unfortunately, the majority of Bibles in the 1800s have no market value and are only important for the individual family.

06:59.600 --> 06:59.861
Okay.

06:59.881 --> 07:00.863
Thank you very much.

07:01.243 --> 07:06.452
You say most of the Bibles in the 19th or 18th century, what would make one unusual?

07:06.712 --> 07:08.115
Well, for a variety of reasons.

07:08.335 --> 07:14.205
One would be a Bible in a specific dialect, which is not, you know, greatly printed.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.130
I mean, a Bible which was printed in Dakota.

07:17.110 --> 07:37.448
or in an indian dialect would have value um a bible with an inscription from let's say napoleon to josephine that would be expensive you know there's variety so specific printings how valuable to anybody are bibles that are were used like the family bible that has the whole genealogy of the family listed in the inside cover and pages

07:37.428 --> 07:49.120
Well, I mean, if you want to go to the top of the ladder, we handled Frederick Douglass' Bible, or his son's Bible, which had the only existing known photograph of Frederick Douglass' daughter who died at 10.

07:49.721 --> 07:55.046
So just from a genealogical point of view on that Bible, that Bible was worth $40,000, $50,000.

07:55.587 --> 08:06.658
Now, if the genealogists, obviously a Bible which has a family history is going to be important, but as far as the monetary value, that's just, you know, depends on who the genealogy is of.

08:06.638 --> 08:30.570
grant you're on wrc with alan stipek good morning good morning sir how are you right so listen i have a betty boop book really i have a betty boop book it goes back to the 30s of course and i have it in uh i put it in um acid-free paper and it's in a plastic bag what is that worth now um the the betty boop in the um the the children's the cartoon books from that time period

08:30.550 --> 08:35.804
They can run anywhere from $25 on up, depending on the individual title and the edition.

08:35.864 --> 08:40.958
I mean, some of them go into the hundreds, and in some situations also into the thousands.

08:41.339 --> 08:44.829
So what I would have to do is see the book specifically and see what edition you have.

08:45.230 --> 08:45.370
Uh-huh.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.523
So, I mean, you could be sitting with some value to a book.

08:48.543 --> 08:50.404
I mean, you might have a three-figure cartoon book.

08:50.785 --> 08:52.166
But then again, it might be only worth $25.

08:52.186 --> 08:53.527
Of course, I don't have it.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.989
I'd have to go in my papers to get it, which would probably be too long.

08:56.009 --> 08:57.951
But I tell you, it has a picture of her on the front.

08:58.051 --> 09:00.333
It's a typical Betty book.

09:00.553 --> 09:01.955
I had a crush on her when I was nine.

09:02.195 --> 09:03.136
I know, it's the truth.

09:03.156 --> 09:03.916
Everybody did.

09:04.417 --> 09:07.600
Now, listen now, but it's of no extreme value.

09:08.501 --> 09:13.165
Probably not, unless you had something which was an exceptionally rare spookiana.

09:13.385 --> 09:14.586
I'll pull it out and look it over.

09:14.606 --> 09:15.627
What should be on there for?

09:15.607 --> 09:19.133
I would have to see the book.

09:19.414 --> 09:20.355
Boopy Anna.

09:20.696 --> 09:24.562
Hey, it's going to be in the next Johnson Dictionary.

09:24.582 --> 09:25.043
Huh?

09:25.063 --> 09:27.447
We were less laughing about Boopy Anna.

09:29.671 --> 09:30.713
Why not?

09:30.693 --> 09:32.856
a certain issue or date number?

09:32.936 --> 09:38.363
I'm not familiar with all of the items or all of the books that the Boop series had.

09:38.604 --> 09:42.990
You have to understand, this man is not a boopyologist.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.912
I'm a pseudo-boopyologist.

09:44.932 --> 09:45.373
I'll pull it out.

09:45.393 --> 09:46.694
If you come out again, I'll call you.

09:46.735 --> 09:48.056
I'll be able to give you some dates and numbers on it.

09:48.076 --> 09:48.176
Sure.

09:48.197 --> 09:53.964
What you could do, sir, is talk to the producer and leave your telephone number with him, and I'd be happy to contact you after the show.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.426
How long would you be on?

09:55.707 --> 09:56.528
Until just an hour.

09:56.588 --> 09:56.768
Yeah.

09:56.748 --> 09:57.189
I see.

09:57.209 --> 09:57.609
Okay.

09:57.809 --> 09:58.890
How much time have you got now?

09:59.351 --> 09:59.992
Not enough.

10:00.412 --> 10:01.173
Okay, good enough.

10:01.193 --> 10:01.834
Hang on.

10:01.954 --> 10:02.795
I'll put you on hold.

10:03.396 --> 10:03.836
There we go.

10:03.856 --> 10:04.337
That's Grant.

10:04.357 --> 10:08.702
He's going to get personalized attention from our newly installed boopologist.

10:09.222 --> 10:10.984
Mary, you're on WRC.

10:11.245 --> 10:12.866
Good morning.

10:12.886 --> 10:13.367
Good morning.

10:14.508 --> 10:14.849
Hi there.

10:14.969 --> 10:15.469
Hi.

10:15.489 --> 10:15.610
Hi.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.211
I have three books.

10:17.271 --> 10:19.274
They're small, leather-bound books.

10:19.294 --> 10:22.838
Two are dated 1810, and one is dated 1811.

10:23.358 --> 10:26.502
And two of them are...

10:26.920 --> 10:30.324
The British Essayist, and one of them is The Rambler.

10:30.665 --> 10:32.627
Okay, let's start with The British Essayist.

10:33.468 --> 10:33.568
Okay.

10:33.588 --> 10:48.747
The series, The British Essayist, I believe in its complete set from that time period is 66 volumes, which is not to be mistaken with The British Poets, which is the compendium to that, which is an additional 30-odd volumes for a total of approximately 100 volumes.

10:49.207 --> 10:54.514
As a set, they would sell for anywhere between $5 to $15 per volume,

10:54.494 --> 10:57.357
depending on the quality of the leather.

10:57.377 --> 10:58.438
You had the little ones, right?

10:58.638 --> 10:58.938
Right.

10:58.958 --> 10:59.819
Okay.

10:59.879 --> 11:03.322
It's a larger edition, which sells for about $25 a volume.

11:03.803 --> 11:09.708
The Rambler, you probably have an odd volume of the magazine, The Rambler.

11:10.229 --> 11:14.233
I'm not sure if... Is this, again, a small... Small leather bag, yes.

11:14.253 --> 11:17.135
Yeah, that's probably just anecdotes from The Rambler or excerpts.

11:17.616 --> 11:22.020
Again, that would fall in the $5 to $20 category, depending on the condition of the book.

11:22.000 --> 11:22.861
Great.

11:22.881 --> 11:24.283
Okay, thank you.

11:24.303 --> 11:26.166
1119 at WRC.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.628
Alan Stipek is our guest.

11:27.648 --> 11:28.530
We're talking books.

11:28.770 --> 11:36.021
If you have a book that you're wondering about as to its value, give us a call at 202-882-WRC1.

11:36.481 --> 11:43.772
Anything really in the rare book or the antique book market or second story or second, I don't know, what is it?

11:43.752 --> 11:45.454
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:45.474 --> 11:46.916
Resale, used, already read books.

11:47.377 --> 11:48.979
Previously read books.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.581
Previously perused.

11:51.723 --> 11:54.186
Give us a call at 202-882-WRC1.

11:54.286 --> 11:56.109
It's 1120 at WRC.

12:00.434 --> 12:02.077
Alan Stipeck, the book guy, is here.

12:02.137 --> 12:04.540
And Ralph, you're next from Lorton on WRC.

12:04.560 --> 12:04.980
Good morning.

12:05.281 --> 12:05.781
Good morning.

12:06.522 --> 12:11.109
I have a book, Evangeline, by Henry Lodworth, Laura Fellow.

12:11.529 --> 12:11.970
Right.

12:11.990 --> 12:12.190
All right.

12:12.828 --> 12:17.759
It's published in 1909 by Rand McNally in Chicago.

12:18.621 --> 12:20.545
It's a reprint.

12:20.665 --> 12:23.010
It probably doesn't have a great market value.

12:24.173 --> 12:28.222
Rand McNally is not known for doing poetry books.

12:28.242 --> 12:29.164
They're known for their maps.

12:30.106 --> 12:31.950
I would imagine it's a $2 to $5 book.

12:32.217 --> 12:32.818
Okay.

12:32.838 --> 12:33.278
Okay.

12:33.298 --> 12:33.619
Thank you.

12:33.659 --> 12:34.279
Now you know.

12:35.401 --> 12:36.963
Let's go to Jamal.

12:37.043 --> 12:37.784
Good morning, Jamal.

12:37.804 --> 12:39.045
You're on WRC.

12:39.065 --> 12:40.367
Yes, good morning to you.

12:40.387 --> 12:50.198
I have a full set of a publication of a magazine that was published in 1914 in Syria before the war.

12:51.039 --> 12:53.702
The 1914, the First World War.

12:53.722 --> 12:56.706
And they are in somehow 80% shape.

12:56.905 --> 12:59.092
Are they useful for anything?

12:59.232 --> 12:59.995
What is the magazine?

13:00.035 --> 13:01.861
Is it like a Syrian pictorial journal?

13:02.081 --> 13:07.438
It's a Syrian daily newspaper, and it was binded at that time in three sets.

13:07.570 --> 13:13.779
and it is showing daily activities in that part of the world with gruesome pictures.

13:13.899 --> 13:14.761
With gruesome pictures.

13:14.881 --> 13:15.982
It's in Arabic, I assume.

13:16.022 --> 13:16.203
Yes.

13:16.824 --> 13:17.284
Yeah, sure.

13:17.585 --> 13:20.629
From a historical standpoint, newspapers are very collectible.

13:21.090 --> 13:24.675
Newspapers from that time period, from that area, have value.

13:24.896 --> 13:29.522
I would have to see the newspapers to ascertain what I think the value would be.

13:30.324 --> 13:31.045
Okay.

13:31.085 --> 13:33.008
I'm interested in that area at that time.

13:33.048 --> 13:33.308
Okay.

13:33.288 --> 13:33.629
Sure.

13:33.649 --> 13:36.593
I mean, we'd be happy to bring them, to look at them, bring them down to the warehouse.

13:36.814 --> 13:37.174
Okay.

13:37.315 --> 13:37.835
Okay.

13:37.855 --> 13:38.717
I will do that.

13:38.737 --> 13:41.021
If somebody can give me where can I go or where can I go?

13:41.181 --> 13:41.281
Sure.

13:41.301 --> 13:46.910
Second Story Books, we're located at 12160 Park Lawn Drive in Rockville.

13:46.930 --> 13:47.371
Park Lawn, okay.

13:47.391 --> 13:51.077
Right, and 301-770-0477.

13:51.631 --> 13:51.952
Thank you.

13:52.853 --> 13:58.783
In general, what is the resale market for foreign language books, particularly foreign languages that are not Western?

13:59.685 --> 14:06.357
There isn't some formula which says that a book in Russian is worth 75% of the same book in English.

14:06.777 --> 14:12.728
In the Washington area, you have a stronger market for foreign language books because of the international population.

14:13.409 --> 14:15.833
It depends on the individual book.

14:16.454 --> 14:18.157
Let's go to Ann in Alexandria.

14:18.197 --> 14:19.138
You're on WRC.

14:19.178 --> 14:19.619
Good morning.

14:20.340 --> 14:20.781
Good morning.

14:21.842 --> 14:41.071
I have found this book in a family attic, and the name of it is Handbook of Practical Cookery for Ladies and Professional Cooks by Pierre Blot, B-L-O-T, and he was a professor of gastronomy and founder of the New York Cooking Academy.

14:41.091 --> 14:42.293
And what edition did you have, ma'am?

14:42.914 --> 14:45.457
What's the date on the book?

14:45.477 --> 14:48.681
It says, D. Ampleton and Company, 1868.

14:48.861 --> 14:49.502
Right.

14:50.643 --> 15:03.078
Okay, and one little tidbit, which you might want to know, I'm sure, it says, in relation to ketchup, many cases of dyspepsia, debility, and consumption come from using such stuff.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.261
Ketchup.

15:05.281 --> 15:07.784
Wait a second, I'm having a ketchup attack here.

15:07.944 --> 15:08.044
Okay.

15:08.699 --> 15:15.502
The book sells for anywhere between $15 to $40, depending on the condition and the edition.

15:15.703 --> 15:17.950
We have had copies in the store in the past.

15:18.132 --> 15:18.552
Uh-huh.

15:19.193 --> 15:19.594
Okay.

15:20.154 --> 15:23.638
We always take out the ketchup chapter.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.282
Yeah, now, where is that address?

15:27.362 --> 15:32.107
It's Second Story Books, 12160 Park Lawn Drive in Rockville.

15:32.127 --> 15:35.951
We have locations also at 2000 P Street in D.C.

15:36.011 --> 15:38.514
and 4836 Bethesda Avenue in Bethesda.

15:38.834 --> 15:39.054
Uh-huh.

15:39.595 --> 15:42.998
And you can give us a call, 301-770-0477.

15:43.519 --> 15:44.460
We'd be happy to help.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.325
Okay, thanks a lot.

15:48.627 --> 15:50.450
This says Ralph, but I thought I talked with Ralph.

15:50.470 --> 15:51.192
Hello, you're on WRC.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.676
I'm glad I found you.

15:53.696 --> 16:02.050
Listen, I'm getting a copy from a relative in England who has my great-great-grandmother.

16:02.451 --> 16:06.718
It was signed by Charles Dickens, a copy of the Christmas Carol, and

16:06.901 --> 16:12.312
He wrote a note to her in the inside of the binding, and he mentions her by name.

16:12.673 --> 16:13.114
That's good.

16:13.254 --> 16:16.221
That's not as good as the Mitchell item, but it's up there.

16:16.261 --> 16:18.726
It's in the four figures.

16:19.127 --> 16:20.229
It's something I'd never sell.

16:20.269 --> 16:21.993
I want to know for insurance purposes.

16:22.013 --> 16:24.578
Okay, for insurance purposes, quite frankly, you'd have to bring the book in.

16:24.618 --> 16:27.164
I have to identify the edition of the Christmas Carol.

16:27.344 --> 16:27.745
For sure.

16:27.725 --> 16:31.328
There are multi-variants to the first edition of the Christmas.

16:31.348 --> 16:31.749
Oh, really?

16:31.769 --> 16:32.650
Multi-variants.

16:32.730 --> 16:38.715
There's like nine separate edition bindings, and that doesn't even go into the page differences.

16:39.136 --> 16:43.159
So I'd have to see it, and then I'd have to look at the signature and the inscription.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.321
Well, I've been told the book is in pristine condition.

16:45.622 --> 16:47.504
It's a readable book.

16:47.624 --> 16:53.269
That's fine, but it still needs to be looked at physically before I can give you a true value.

16:53.329 --> 16:54.270
Ballpark figure.

16:54.390 --> 16:56.392
Ballpark figure, it's in four figures.

16:56.572 --> 16:56.892
Wow.

16:57.513 --> 16:57.613
Okay.

16:57.982 --> 16:58.843
Thank you very much.

16:58.903 --> 16:59.224
Okay.

16:59.264 --> 16:59.564
Bye-bye.

16:59.624 --> 17:00.205
Bye-bye.

17:00.225 --> 17:01.627
Let's go to Marion Bowie.

17:01.647 --> 17:02.608
You're on WRC.

17:02.889 --> 17:03.570
Yes.

17:03.710 --> 17:04.171
Hello.

17:04.311 --> 17:04.551
Hi there.

17:05.272 --> 17:05.332
Hi.

17:05.352 --> 17:08.376
I have two leather-bound books.

17:08.476 --> 17:13.423
One was published in 1815 and the other one in 1816.

17:14.365 --> 17:16.407
And the first is a Latin grammar.

17:17.930 --> 17:21.214
And the second, ma'am?

17:21.274 --> 17:24.799
The second one is The Remains, which are sermons.

17:24.847 --> 17:28.472
of Reverend John Mason.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.076
It was published in Pittsburgh.

17:31.096 --> 17:32.918
The first one was published in Edinburgh.

17:32.938 --> 17:37.885
Okay, the first book, the Latin grammar, is really of no consequence.

17:37.945 --> 17:40.249
It could be worth $5 as a curiosity.

17:40.789 --> 17:54.769
The book that you have on the sermons of the Reverend Mason could be worth some money specifically because of the fact that it's published in Pittsburgh in 1816, which is a fairly early imprint for the city of Pittsburgh.

17:54.749 --> 17:58.759
As far as the content, the sermons are no consequence.

17:59.099 --> 18:00.763
The imprint date is the important fact.

18:00.964 --> 18:02.728
Well, that's presumptive of you.

18:02.808 --> 18:05.054
Someone may find some value out of a sermon now and then.

18:05.074 --> 18:06.758
I am ashamed of myself.

18:06.838 --> 18:07.339
I'm sorry.

18:09.564 --> 18:12.792
The second one also has directions for use.

18:12.839 --> 18:15.242
which I think are kind of interesting.

18:15.342 --> 18:15.782
Wait a minute.

18:15.822 --> 18:17.344
Direction for use of sermons?

18:17.904 --> 18:25.633
Yeah, in part of the sermons, they talk about how youth should conduct themselves.

18:26.013 --> 18:26.574
Youth.

18:26.754 --> 18:28.215
Oh, youths.

18:28.235 --> 18:29.597
Youths.

18:29.657 --> 18:32.440
I mean, kids.

18:32.540 --> 18:33.341
You from East New York?

18:33.421 --> 18:37.085
All I could think of was Joe Pesci in that.

18:37.105 --> 18:37.746
Youths.

18:37.766 --> 18:40.028
Youths from East New York.

18:40.008 --> 18:45.334
All right, Mary, I think we found out about them, and I'm glad to... I hope now, see, Alan?

18:45.694 --> 18:47.336
There's direction for youth in there.

18:47.696 --> 18:49.258
We know there's some value in that book.

18:49.358 --> 19:04.935
And actually, to take this one step further, there are books of sermons that were published by reverence to be used as traveling sermons, and a lot of times you will find these published at that time in the western part of the United States, because as people went further and further...

19:04.915 --> 19:12.313
In the Western expansion, books had to be published, churches were built, and there was a need for a book on sermons.

19:12.393 --> 19:17.646
And so it wouldn't be that unbelievable for the fact to be a book on the use of sermons.

19:17.786 --> 19:21.034
So this is a potential good one.

19:21.082 --> 19:22.543
This is very interesting.

19:22.563 --> 19:23.684
It's an interesting piece.

19:23.765 --> 19:27.348
I don't think 1816 is really the earliest imprint date in Pittsburgh.

19:27.368 --> 19:30.931
I would have to check the bibliography, but it will have some value just because of the date.

19:31.072 --> 19:31.652
Very good, Mary.

19:31.832 --> 19:32.433
Thanks for calling.

19:32.633 --> 19:33.514
Yes, thank you.

19:33.674 --> 19:34.935
Let's go to Jack in his car.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.677
You're on WRC with Alan Stipek.

19:37.137 --> 19:37.538
Hello.

19:37.618 --> 19:37.998
Yes, sir.

19:38.018 --> 19:39.219
Oh, this is Jody.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.941
Oh, I'm sorry, Jody.

19:40.961 --> 19:41.461
Yes, you're right.

19:41.762 --> 19:42.262
Okay.

19:42.983 --> 19:43.303
Go ahead.

19:43.563 --> 19:46.026
I have a small volume of Black Beauty.

19:46.807 --> 19:49.369
It's about four inches by six inches.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.430
It's the pony edition.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.843
Pony edition, is that what it's called?

19:52.863 --> 19:54.025
No, it is now.

19:54.306 --> 19:58.553
It was published in Philadelphia by the Henry Altimus Company.

19:58.573 --> 20:07.006
Right, that's a reprint house, and most probably what you have is a little pictorial book that was used generally by little kids to read.

20:07.066 --> 20:08.589
No, there's no pictures in it.

20:08.609 --> 20:09.470
No, it wouldn't have pictures.

20:09.510 --> 20:12.595
It was just a small reading copy that was given to children.

20:12.615 --> 20:14.198
They sell for between $3 and $7.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.600
Oh, they do?

20:15.620 --> 20:15.760
Mm-hmm.

20:16.229 --> 20:17.891
There's no publishing date in it.

20:17.911 --> 20:22.296
No, Artemis would not have a publishing date because he reprinted books and took them out of the public domain.

20:22.997 --> 20:23.958
Oh, I see.

20:24.078 --> 20:26.000
Sometimes you use the word pirated.

20:26.421 --> 20:29.264
All right, thank you.

20:29.424 --> 20:30.185
Thank you very much.

20:30.265 --> 20:31.226
Now let's go to Jack.

20:31.246 --> 20:32.407
You're on WRC, Jack.

20:32.588 --> 20:33.288
Yeah, good morning.

20:33.368 --> 20:36.112
I have a question in the abstract.

20:36.172 --> 20:37.173
That answer we can make.

20:37.193 --> 20:44.481
I'm living in Poland at the time, and what would be the value in the marketplace if I could find one?

20:44.798 --> 20:48.485
Our first edition of Shenkevich's Quo Varys.

20:49.647 --> 20:52.051
You know, that's one of the peculiar books.

20:52.071 --> 20:54.576
That's like Lou Wallace, then her.

20:55.057 --> 21:01.989
Supposedly it has a market value, and you could say, in fact, it deserves one because of the importance of the book.

21:02.009 --> 21:03.752
The problem is find somebody that actually wants it.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.217
So I could say it's worth $100 to $200.

21:06.998 --> 21:09.102
The problem is try to find somebody who'll pay it.

21:09.082 --> 21:15.588
You know, it really is one of these great books which doesn't have any marketability because nobody's interested in reading it.

21:15.988 --> 21:21.053
Well, of course, a first edition would be in Polish, so that would be harder to find a market for.

21:21.073 --> 21:21.253
Right.

21:21.333 --> 21:26.577
Well, you know, the person who is a completist or is a purist in collecting would obviously want in this original state.

21:27.098 --> 21:29.520
The point is, what is it actually worth?

21:29.580 --> 21:33.544
Is the scarcity equivalent to the desirability?

21:33.784 --> 21:37.427
I mean, just this formula here, you're right, it is abstract.

21:37.968 --> 21:38.548
I would...

21:38.528 --> 21:50.119
If I purchased the book, I would probably make a Tony catalog inscription and build it up and hope that somebody felt that what my description was was acceptable and pay what I thought was the price for its scarcity.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.643
But again, you're going to have a hard time actually selling it.

21:54.243 --> 21:56.746
The other question, I've got another question if you've got time.

21:58.347 --> 22:05.234
You know, there are a lot of, as I go through some of the second-hand bookshops in Poland, a lot of books are coming out of the woodwork now.

22:05.274 --> 22:06.695
There's a lot in Russian.

22:06.735 --> 22:08.417
Is there something I should be looking for?

22:09.038 --> 22:09.759
In Russian?

22:10.040 --> 22:13.626
I always look for Russian books with enamel printing plates in them.

22:14.728 --> 22:19.195
The artwork, constructionism is very, very collectible.

22:19.997 --> 22:22.902
That would be the key to any books in Russian.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.209
If you read Russian fluently, I also look for the literature of the 19th century.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.675
Any of the important Russian authors...

22:30.655 --> 22:36.861
Just do what you would do if you were buying books in the United States, just what the logic of what you think the best books would be.

22:37.302 --> 22:45.530
But constructionism, I mean, if I had to pinpoint something that has real strong marketability in the United States, it's any books with constructionism or theater.

22:46.271 --> 22:46.751
Okay.

22:46.771 --> 22:46.991
All right.

22:47.191 --> 22:47.732
Thank you.

22:47.752 --> 22:48.993
Thank you very much for your call.

22:49.133 --> 22:51.576
More calls ahead if you're calling and getting a busy signal.

22:51.596 --> 22:57.422
It's because we're jammed up, as usual, with Alan Stipek, the book guy, on the talk station, AM 980 WRC.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.823
It's 1135.

23:02.718 --> 23:04.542
11.39 at WRC.

23:04.663 --> 23:06.647
Alan Steifeck from Second Story Books is with us.

23:06.687 --> 23:11.639
We're looking at old books, and even new ones sometimes are worth lots of money, but primarily old ones today.

23:11.699 --> 23:13.403
Marjorie, you're on WRC.

23:13.704 --> 23:16.069
Thank you.

23:16.268 --> 23:18.793
Two books by Joseph Conrad.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.658
Oh, I can't believe you said that.

23:21.718 --> 23:23.662
I was going to say we're going to have a Conrad caller.

23:23.722 --> 23:26.407
I turned today to Conrad and said, we're going to have a Conrad caller.

23:26.427 --> 23:26.988
All right.

23:27.008 --> 23:27.709
Let's go.

23:28.110 --> 23:33.440
These are numbered editions put out by Doubleday Paging Company in 1925.

23:33.841 --> 23:34.201
Right.

23:35.123 --> 23:35.925
The white volume set?

23:35.945 --> 23:37.247
There was 300 books.

23:37.497 --> 23:38.378
In each one.

23:38.458 --> 23:38.679
Right.

23:38.839 --> 23:40.642
I have the Rover and Suspense.

23:41.844 --> 23:43.606
Now, these are the ones that were not signed.

23:43.646 --> 23:44.347
Is that correct?

23:44.447 --> 23:45.489
No, they are not signed.

23:45.509 --> 23:47.572
Yeah, this is the American edition.

23:48.554 --> 23:52.660
Slipcase, it is... They come in slipcases.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.422
Right, dust wrapper and slipcase.

23:54.643 --> 23:59.330
They sell for... It's actually one of 377 copies.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.454
And it's about a $400 book retail.

24:02.995 --> 24:03.676
That's Rover.

24:04.337 --> 24:05.479
And what was the other title?

24:05.864 --> 24:08.767
377, that was for Rover.

24:08.787 --> 24:10.729
The other one, that was for Suspense.

24:10.889 --> 24:11.730
No, that was Rover.

24:12.131 --> 24:12.451
I see.

24:12.471 --> 24:14.073
Well, then there both must be that one.

24:14.093 --> 24:16.095
Yeah, the other one is 377 also.

24:16.455 --> 24:21.401
And again, in slipcase and dust wrap, and I'm courting these in pristine condition, is about 350.

24:21.421 --> 24:21.721
Uh-huh.

24:23.103 --> 24:24.004
Uh-huh.

24:24.124 --> 24:25.705
Who would be interested in buying them?

24:25.806 --> 24:26.206
We would.

24:26.767 --> 24:27.147
You would.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.028
As he raises his hand.

24:29.069 --> 24:31.251
Sure, you can contact me at Second Story Books.

24:31.652 --> 24:33.694
Can I come to the P Street office?

24:33.674 --> 24:35.537
Sure, you could come to P Street.

24:35.737 --> 24:42.829
I would like to see the books, or you could drop them off, and we'd give you a receipt, and I would come down and take a look at them, or you could call me at Rockville, and we could set up an appointment.

24:43.110 --> 24:44.011
All right, good enough.

24:44.111 --> 24:44.432
Okay.

24:44.572 --> 24:45.113
Thank you.

24:45.133 --> 24:55.790
And can I just say, I seriously, before the show started, I took my little book of reference, and I always turned the page and put my finger on a title, just thinking that maybe somebody will call, right?

24:56.131 --> 24:57.994
And, in fact, I turned to Conrad.

24:57.974 --> 24:58.975
It is amazing.

24:59.135 --> 25:03.299
Alan Stipek, psychic and boopologist.

25:03.319 --> 25:03.900
Boopologist.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.822
And, Tom, you're on WRC.

25:05.922 --> 25:06.503
Good morning.

25:07.544 --> 25:07.944
Hi, Tom.

25:08.465 --> 25:08.865
Hello, Tom.

25:08.885 --> 25:09.406
This is Tom.

25:09.566 --> 25:10.507
Yeah.

25:10.647 --> 25:18.195
Civil War and Song and Story by Frank Moore.

25:18.295 --> 25:18.535
Right.

25:18.956 --> 25:19.716
Collier, 1889.

25:19.756 --> 25:19.937
Right.

25:20.517 --> 25:23.340
Do you have the leather edition, the red volume edition, or the...

25:23.658 --> 25:24.499
Blue edition.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.342
I was getting blue out, right?

25:27.043 --> 25:30.728
Anywhere from $40 to $75, depending on the condition of the book.

25:31.870 --> 25:32.531
Okay, thank you.

25:32.571 --> 25:32.931
Sure thing.

25:33.011 --> 25:33.792
Thank you very much.

25:33.853 --> 25:35.214
Let's go next to Alice.

25:35.375 --> 25:36.296
She's in Bethesda.

25:36.336 --> 25:37.077
Good morning, Alice.

25:37.578 --> 25:38.679
Yes.

25:38.699 --> 25:40.182
I just thought of something else.

25:40.202 --> 25:46.911
I'd like to know how much the 20th Century Chronicles, brand new, and its original package is selling for now.

25:47.312 --> 25:52.399
I know it's in the high school reference libraries, but you know what I just thought of?

25:52.835 --> 25:58.162
When I was a teenager in 1935, I picked up a newspaper in Charlotte Amelie.

25:58.964 --> 25:59.745
I still have it.

26:00.686 --> 26:01.607
Is that worth anything?

26:02.208 --> 26:03.750
Which question were you talking about first?

26:03.770 --> 26:06.554
The 20th Century Chronicles, the three-volume edition?

26:06.574 --> 26:07.736
No, it's not three-volume.

26:07.916 --> 26:13.184
It's one 15-pound edition, and it's in a carrying case that has a handle on it.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.907
Okay, yeah, they come in a variety of different editions.

26:16.528 --> 26:20.193
That would sell in our store for somewhere about $30 to $40.

26:20.634 --> 26:22.116
Isn't that expensive?

26:22.332 --> 26:24.417
That would be the maximum we would sell it for.

26:25.439 --> 26:32.895
Now, the newspaper from 1935 really doesn't really have a great market value.

26:33.276 --> 26:35.441
By not having a great market value, it might be worth $2.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.205
It would be worth $2.

26:37.265 --> 26:37.966
It might be worth $2.

26:37.986 --> 26:38.948
I think we'd pay $0.02 for it.

26:38.968 --> 26:41.995
Okay, well, there you go, 1,000% increase.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.299
Well, that's inflation for you.

26:44.539 --> 26:47.744
And you know there are some grammatical errors in the ad.

26:47.764 --> 26:52.071
Oh, we have an issue problem here, the rare issue problem.

26:52.091 --> 26:52.952
It might be worth $2.25.

26:52.992 --> 26:53.773
Well, I don't know.

26:53.813 --> 27:00.704
It's in good condition, but I just saw it when I was looking through my things about a month ago, and I put it right back.

27:00.744 --> 27:05.531
But while I was sitting and waiting, I'd like to get rid of the 20th Century Chronicles.

27:05.612 --> 27:06.293
I looked through it.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.838
I opened it up, looked through it, but it was a gift.

27:10.038 --> 27:10.919
Wouldn't you know?

27:10.980 --> 27:11.701
I wouldn't buy it.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.205
Well, you can use it for a doorstop.

27:14.245 --> 27:16.589
I mean, it has about 15 pounds.

27:16.609 --> 27:17.230
I could do that.

27:17.691 --> 27:18.392
Thanks for calling us.

27:18.512 --> 27:18.993
Thank you.

27:19.153 --> 27:20.055
Bye-bye.

27:20.195 --> 27:24.282
Just a question, because sometimes we talk about authors who hit it big.

27:24.322 --> 27:29.751
No one is bigger for reasons I do not understand than the guy who wrote of Iowa.

27:29.731 --> 27:34.721
and he's out with, as somebody called them, postcards disguised as novels, Waller.

27:35.543 --> 27:40.412
Is there any collectability to him yet, or do you anticipate there ever will be since he's marketed himself so heavily?

27:40.973 --> 27:46.845
There probably will be because of his marketing, and I'm getting away from these ultra...

27:46.825 --> 28:07.618
modern dealers uh all these these books they're just too much for me to to deal they like buying speculating in futures i'd like being emerged in good 16th century tomes you know you know i'll leave the ultra moderns to somebody else that want to speculate on the 1996 books in 94. but is a first edition of his worth keeping

28:07.598 --> 28:08.119
It is.

28:08.679 --> 28:09.300
Yeah, it will be.

28:10.742 --> 28:12.745
It's the way of the market.

28:12.805 --> 28:25.462
Quite frankly, moderns are a specifically large part of our market in used books, and justifiably, so now it's taken the next leap into the ultramoderns or the most recent books.

28:26.443 --> 28:27.825
Marion, you're on WRC.

28:27.845 --> 28:28.246
Good morning.

28:28.706 --> 28:29.527
Oh, yes, good morning.

28:30.569 --> 28:33.673
I have a number of beautiful old books.

28:34.025 --> 28:37.694
but I just picked two from downstairs and wanted to ask you about.

28:38.395 --> 28:44.069
How about The Personal History of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens?

28:44.109 --> 28:45.372
What edition do you have, ma'am?

28:45.392 --> 28:50.143
Well, it doesn't say, but it's illustrated in color by Frank Reynolds.

28:50.242 --> 28:51.363
By Frank Reynolds.

28:51.443 --> 28:52.144
That's a reprint.

28:52.945 --> 28:53.686
Oh, okay.

28:53.706 --> 28:55.087
They're beautiful illustrations.

28:55.127 --> 28:56.028
It's probably a nice book.

28:56.088 --> 29:03.416
I would have to see that before I could give you a real appraisal of it, obviously the edition.

29:03.937 --> 29:04.878
And you're in Rockville?

29:04.918 --> 29:05.538
That's correct.

29:05.558 --> 29:05.959
Okay.

29:06.419 --> 29:09.462
Now, the other one is probably a reprint then, too, 1930.

29:09.543 --> 29:11.625
That's a reprint, Dickens.

29:11.645 --> 29:12.306
The Decameron.

29:12.806 --> 29:13.186
Oh, sure.

29:13.227 --> 29:14.007
That's definitely a reprint.

29:14.027 --> 29:15.289
With color plates.

29:15.309 --> 29:16.310
And who's it published by?

29:16.850 --> 29:18.392
Published by Gardner.

29:19.064 --> 29:21.447
It's published in Garden City, but by whom?

29:21.808 --> 29:22.569
Is it R.H.

29:22.589 --> 29:23.690
Macy and Company?

29:24.051 --> 29:27.395
It just says copyright 1930 by Garden City Publishing.

29:27.415 --> 29:27.656
Okay.

29:27.676 --> 29:28.837
Oh, it's the Garden City reprint?

29:29.118 --> 29:30.940
That would probably be like a $20 book.

29:31.461 --> 29:32.643
Is it a two-volume edition?

29:33.223 --> 29:33.424
No.

29:33.504 --> 29:33.904
It's a one?

29:34.205 --> 29:34.485
No.

29:34.786 --> 29:35.206
Yeah.

29:35.226 --> 29:35.967
The one volume.

29:35.987 --> 29:36.388
Yeah.

29:36.468 --> 29:37.730
I would imagine no more than $20.

29:37.850 --> 29:38.050
Uh-huh.

29:39.292 --> 29:41.615
Garden City was like a book club edition at that time.

29:42.316 --> 29:42.456
Uh-huh.

29:42.436 --> 29:43.577
Okay.

29:43.597 --> 29:43.978
All right.

29:44.038 --> 29:46.860
Well, I need to come and show you some other things.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.581
I'm happy to see them.

29:47.781 --> 29:48.062
All right.

29:48.082 --> 29:48.462
Thank you.

29:48.542 --> 29:48.862
Thank you.

29:48.943 --> 29:50.024
Let's go to Mary in Bowie.

29:50.044 --> 29:51.865
You're on WRC with Alan Stipek.

29:52.226 --> 29:52.786
Good morning.

29:53.968 --> 30:00.174
I have, like a previous caller, Evangeline leather.

30:02.516 --> 30:07.121
On the front of it is the picture, a long, narrow picture.

30:08.142 --> 30:08.342
Mm-hmm.

30:09.436 --> 30:11.558
No publishing date.

30:11.578 --> 30:13.100
It's H.M.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.802
Caldwell Company, New York.

30:15.822 --> 30:17.103
It's a reprint of the book.

30:17.684 --> 30:23.930
It probably is just an extra illustrated binding done in a Victorian fashion.

30:24.390 --> 30:29.635
Without seeing the book specifically, I'm going to hazard a guess and say it's probably worth between $20 and $40.

30:29.756 --> 30:30.016
Okay.

30:30.757 --> 30:32.358
Maybe if the leather is in good condition.

30:32.758 --> 30:32.999
All right.

30:33.319 --> 30:36.422
And I have two, and they're only...

30:37.634 --> 30:39.236
I'm not sure it's leather-bound.

30:39.256 --> 30:41.079
It looks like almost an imitation.

30:41.579 --> 30:45.525
On the front, William Shakespeare, and they're about two by three inches.

30:45.545 --> 30:47.928
Yeah, little tiny Shakespeare volumes.

30:47.948 --> 30:50.251
Published by Knickerbocker Leather Novelty.

30:50.271 --> 30:51.633
And how many volumes do you have?

30:51.653 --> 30:52.394
I have two.

30:52.514 --> 30:56.800
Okay, you need about another 38 to complete the set.

30:56.820 --> 30:57.921
So, you know...

30:57.901 --> 30:59.844
You've got 5% there.

31:00.345 --> 31:01.027
You've got a quest.

31:01.047 --> 31:02.650
Look at it like the Holy Grail.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.573
Don't buy them all at one time, though.

31:04.813 --> 31:06.216
You'll kill the enjoyment.

31:06.236 --> 31:10.363
Well, I mean, are these... They're worth, like, we sell them in the store for about $3 per volume.

31:10.383 --> 31:10.784
Yeah, $3.

31:10.944 --> 31:11.105
Right.

31:11.626 --> 31:12.447
Okay, thank you.

31:12.527 --> 31:13.048
Thank you.

31:13.309 --> 31:15.092
It's 1147 here at WRC.

31:15.112 --> 31:17.356
We're talking books with Alan Stipek.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.738
Let's go next to Doug and Bowie.

31:18.758 --> 31:19.760
You're on WRC.

31:20.061 --> 31:21.183
Yeah, I have two questions.

31:21.203 --> 31:21.343
Mm-hmm.

31:21.712 --> 31:23.555
Okay, are you familiar with the congressional record?

31:23.615 --> 31:23.996
Sure am.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.799
How about publications back in 72?

31:25.819 --> 31:27.061
1972?

31:27.522 --> 31:28.403
Yeah.

31:29.124 --> 31:29.785
Good doorstops.

31:30.346 --> 31:30.787
Oh, really?

31:31.047 --> 31:31.789
Yeah.

31:31.809 --> 31:33.311
How long should I hold those for value?

31:34.173 --> 31:36.537
Not in your lifetime, sir, unfortunately.

31:36.557 --> 31:41.825
They will never have value because they're mass-produced, and there just isn't any market for them.

31:42.426 --> 31:43.067
Okay.

31:43.087 --> 31:44.189
I have something of better value here.

31:44.229 --> 31:46.613
How about a full volume of book of knowledge?

31:47.054 --> 31:47.635
A few years?

31:47.615 --> 31:49.217
Mm-hmm.

31:49.537 --> 31:49.738
From 1924.

31:49.758 --> 31:54.203
Unfortunately, that has less value than the congressional records.

31:54.403 --> 32:08.300
Out-of-date encyclopedias, except for the Encyclopedia Botanica 11th edition, which is not out-of-date, it just was a compilation of the best scholars of the time, generally have no, and I mean and am emphasizing, no market value.

32:09.301 --> 32:13.526
Unfortunately, I don't think you have anything that will put your kids through school.

32:14.167 --> 32:14.427
Really?

32:14.607 --> 32:15.308
Yeah.

32:15.328 --> 32:15.428
So...

32:15.863 --> 32:18.710
Is there no value in selling it?

32:19.111 --> 32:22.300
Should they be trashed, or is there any value?

32:22.320 --> 32:29.679
Oh, quite frankly, old encyclopedias are one of the only books I would say too trashed because they're of no use to people right now because they're out of date.

32:30.160 --> 32:30.902
Uh...

32:30.882 --> 32:36.830
I mean, I wish there was some way I could tell you to reuse them, but the information is just not applicable at this point.

32:37.151 --> 32:42.318
I would say, of any books, and I very rarely will ever say this, is to throw books out, those would be the books you would throw out.

32:42.599 --> 32:43.400
Yeah.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.423
I'll just get three more feet of room on my shelf.

32:45.443 --> 32:46.104
Yeah.

32:46.124 --> 32:46.404
Okay.

32:46.584 --> 32:47.285
All right, thanks.

32:47.305 --> 32:47.646
Thank you.

32:48.427 --> 32:48.587
Bye-bye.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.971
Our number is 202-882-WRC1.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.115
We're talking with Alan Steipik of Second Story Books.

32:53.175 --> 33:00.048
Once again, if you have books at hand that you'd like to find the value of, please bring them with you to the phone when you come.

33:00.528 --> 33:02.011
Steve, you're on WRC.

33:02.071 --> 33:02.512
Good morning.

33:02.672 --> 33:03.133
Good morning.

33:03.569 --> 33:04.010
Hi.

33:04.030 --> 33:06.494
I've got two books and a newspaper.

33:06.534 --> 33:15.447
One of the books is a miniature edition of Pilgrim's Progress with an inscription of 1873 in the front page.

33:16.269 --> 33:16.409
Mm-hmm.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.791
It's just a textbook edition.

33:19.113 --> 33:20.115
They sell for $5 or $10.

33:20.275 --> 33:20.515
Okay.

33:21.156 --> 33:27.146
And the second one is a recipe book presented by the Hyrick Brewing Company.

33:27.206 --> 33:27.366
Mm-hmm.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.393
Mm-hmm.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.299
Mm-hmm.

33:32.700 --> 33:45.186
Mm-hmm.

33:45.537 --> 33:46.479
Pictures, what have you.

33:46.719 --> 33:49.744
$10 to $25 on the open collectible market.

33:50.485 --> 33:53.330
The comics, I think, are worth more than the headline.

33:53.610 --> 33:54.892
And I'm not saying this facetiously.

33:55.854 --> 33:57.717
Comics from that time period have value.

33:58.959 --> 34:01.483
I would sell it in the store intact.

34:01.684 --> 34:02.745
We'd probably package it at $25.

34:02.826 --> 34:05.209
It says comic book.

34:05.430 --> 34:07.393
It's a little more like a...

34:07.964 --> 34:09.906
comic book as opposed to a fold-out newspaper.

34:09.926 --> 34:10.146
Really?

34:10.207 --> 34:20.198
Then I would, you know, quite frankly, I would check with a comic dealer and find out if there's something specific about that one edition that might have extra value than just being an insert in the newspaper.

34:20.558 --> 34:24.062
I'm serious about that because early comics have value.

34:24.963 --> 34:32.052
Some of them, I mean, obviously everybody out there knows about Superman and all these, you know, mega comic books and the six-year-old kids that pay $20,000 for them.

34:32.072 --> 34:36.857
But you might find that that insert might have a collectability on its own.

34:37.023 --> 34:37.664
Thank you.

34:37.684 --> 34:37.984
Sure thing.

34:38.825 --> 34:39.365
Weird, isn't it?

34:39.966 --> 34:41.147
Joan, you're on WRC.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.430
Not as weird as eight-year-old kids that have $100 bills in their pocket.

34:44.870 --> 34:45.350
Thank you.

34:45.671 --> 34:46.832
All right.

34:46.852 --> 35:07.030
I have a book entitled Abe Lincoln's Yarns and Stories, introduction by Colonel Alexander McClure, personal friend and advisor, storytelling president, published by Thompson and Thomas of Chicago in 1901, and the inside cover has

35:07.465 --> 35:12.657
In personal handwriting, this book belongs to Herbert M. Hanks, New York.

35:13.098 --> 35:17.969
Now, isn't the Hanks family, didn't they marry into the Lincoln family?

35:18.350 --> 35:24.664
I am not familiar with the... Nancy Hanks was... Nancy Hanks was... His wife...

35:24.948 --> 35:26.350
His mother, wasn't he?

35:26.370 --> 35:27.152
Was his mother?

35:27.312 --> 35:30.297
Nancy Hanks was his mother, yeah.

35:30.618 --> 35:38.912
Possibly what you would need to do is get a genealogical reference book and find out if Herman Hanks is, in fact, the Hanks is of the Lincoln family.

35:39.133 --> 35:41.116
Well, I'd like you to be Tom of Hanks' grandfather.

35:41.677 --> 35:43.901
That wouldn't be bad either.

35:43.921 --> 35:46.365
I mean, there's collectability there also, you know.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.028
I would check that out.

35:48.168 --> 35:54.860
I would assume that just having that provenance might increase the value of a book a couple of dollars.

35:55.201 --> 35:56.583
But as a book, it's only a $5 to $10 book.

35:56.603 --> 35:56.763
I see.

35:56.863 --> 35:57.164
Okay?

35:57.184 --> 35:59.027
All right, thank you.

35:59.047 --> 35:59.688
Thank you very much.

35:59.708 --> 36:03.435
You've got room for a few more calls here at 202-882-WRC1.

36:03.736 --> 36:06.560
If you're driving about, Star WRC, a free call on Bell Atlantic.

36:06.901 --> 36:08.764
Pound 980, a free call on Cellular 1.

36:08.804 --> 36:10.868
It's 1152 at WRC.

36:13.565 --> 36:15.551
11.55 with Alan Stiapek.

36:15.611 --> 36:16.353
I'm Mike Cuthbert.

36:16.373 --> 36:18.178
Open phones in the noon hour.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.786
And right now, let's go to Brian in Alexandria.

36:20.826 --> 36:21.989
Brian, you're on WRC.

36:22.350 --> 36:22.872
Hey, thanks.

36:22.892 --> 36:24.015
I got two first editions.

36:24.156 --> 36:27.405
First of all, do you do anything with old playing cards?

36:28.195 --> 36:28.515
You do.

36:30.078 --> 36:33.623
My wife found this deck that appears to be French, and it's dated 1890.

36:33.723 --> 36:35.025
It's got a blue stamp on it.

36:35.045 --> 36:37.428
I would have to see that.

36:38.109 --> 36:40.052
There's more to it than just the date.

36:40.693 --> 36:42.736
Playing cards are a field within themselves.

36:42.956 --> 36:46.221
It's just a question of bringing it down to the Rockville Warehouse, and we'd be happy to help you.

36:46.201 --> 36:47.142
To the which warehouse?

36:47.162 --> 36:48.104
The Rockville Warehouse.

36:48.444 --> 36:49.205
Okay.

36:49.225 --> 36:51.629
And then the dog barking, sorry.

36:52.390 --> 36:54.733
Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck First Edition.

36:55.194 --> 36:58.759
A first of Mice and Men, we have one in the store right now for $450.

36:58.799 --> 36:59.781
Whoa.

37:00.302 --> 37:02.445
A dust wrapper in very good condition.

37:03.206 --> 37:04.548
We still have it in the store for $450.

37:04.568 --> 37:04.728
Oh.

37:05.029 --> 37:05.409
Yeah.

37:05.449 --> 37:08.293
Well, this one, it's got the dust jacket.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.215
It's in pretty good condition.

37:09.275 --> 37:11.879
It's got a little bit of damage, but it's all right.

37:11.899 --> 37:12.900
The other one is...

37:13.184 --> 37:17.009
The Town by William Faulkner, 1957, first printing.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.191
Is it the signed edition?

37:19.633 --> 37:21.756
You mean actually signed?

37:21.776 --> 37:25.762
There's a signed limited edition of The Town that preceded the first real edition.

37:25.782 --> 37:26.062
I see.

37:26.122 --> 37:27.284
No, I don't think that's this one.

37:27.444 --> 37:31.309
The Town is a $50 to $75 book in good condition and dust wrapper.

37:31.329 --> 37:31.590
All right.

37:31.610 --> 37:33.292
Well, would you be interested in seeing the Steinbeck?

37:33.372 --> 37:34.133
Sure, I'd be happy to.

37:34.354 --> 37:35.195
All right.

37:35.215 --> 37:35.776
Thanks very much.

37:35.896 --> 37:36.457
Thanks for calling.

37:36.477 --> 37:37.778
Let's go to Ruth in Mount Vernon.

37:37.798 --> 37:38.740
You're on WRC.

37:39.481 --> 37:40.062
Hey, Alan.

37:40.783 --> 37:42.465
I have some more Charles Dickinson.

37:42.648 --> 37:45.512
And one is David Copperfield, 1850.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.957
And I have a Pickwick Papers, 1837.

37:49.198 --> 37:51.882
Well, it's about the right times.

37:52.302 --> 37:56.949
And they're all the same publisher, Chapman and Hall in London.

37:57.290 --> 38:00.134
And I have a Nicholas Nickleby.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.838
And it looks like it's personally autographed.

38:02.858 --> 38:05.382
It says, Faithfully Yours, Charles Dickens.

38:05.699 --> 38:08.864
with several lines written under the Charles Dickens.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.188
That's Chapman and Hall also, I would assume, right?

38:11.368 --> 38:12.209
Yes, they're all.

38:12.450 --> 38:15.895
And that's published in, like, 1838, 1839?

38:16.416 --> 38:17.918
Well, it's got a lot of numerals.

38:18.198 --> 38:21.784
M-D-C-C-X-X-X-I-X.

38:22.253 --> 38:23.174
Well, that's 1839.

38:23.194 --> 38:23.755
Uh-huh.

38:25.598 --> 38:28.382
I got three X's and an IX.

38:28.422 --> 38:29.043
That's 39.

38:29.103 --> 38:31.426
Yeah, you might have something of consequence there.

38:31.466 --> 38:36.253
All the books that you're talking about are the dates upon where the first editions were issued.

38:36.353 --> 38:44.725
And, in fact, if you did have an inscribed Dickens, you'd be talking, as I told the gentleman before, thousands of dollars' worth of equity there.

38:44.986 --> 38:47.209
Well, it looks perfectly in good condition.

38:47.229 --> 38:50.674
I bought them about 40, 45 years ago in London.

38:50.694 --> 38:52.176
That's a good place to find Dickens.

38:52.156 --> 38:54.821
I would be very interested to look at the books.

38:54.881 --> 38:57.465
I mean, if you contacted me at Second Story, 301-770-0477.

38:57.606 --> 39:01.773
301-770-770-0477.

39:06.481 --> 39:08.545
I'd be happy to help you figure out what you have.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.733
Ellen, I'd love to.

39:10.753 --> 39:12.035
Hey, we have a date.

39:12.055 --> 39:12.736
Thank you so much.

39:12.896 --> 39:17.683
In the meantime, is there anything that Ruth should do to take care of those Dickens editions particularly?

39:17.803 --> 39:18.304
In what sense?

39:18.364 --> 39:22.851
I mean, don't put them in your stove, but just keep them where you had them.

39:22.871 --> 39:24.833
Don't let that dog in the background get me right here.

39:25.134 --> 39:26.496
I was going to say, keep it on an upper shelf.

39:26.636 --> 39:28.699
No plastic wrapping or any of that kind of stuff.

39:28.739 --> 39:29.080
Oh, sure.

39:29.100 --> 39:29.941
Put them in plastic.

39:30.001 --> 39:34.768
It's always good to protect them, but make sure when you put them in plastic, you don't nick the edges putting them into the plastic.

39:34.788 --> 39:36.190
One last quick call.

39:36.230 --> 39:37.392
Sherita, we're almost out of time.

39:37.452 --> 39:38.093
Go fast.

39:39.760 --> 39:51.678
Harcourt and Brace miniature score series, the symphonies of Hayden, Schubert, and Mozart, and the nine symphonies of Beethoven, and they were published in 1935.

39:51.778 --> 39:51.979
Right.

39:51.999 --> 39:52.480
Not really.

39:52.540 --> 39:53.181
Not really.

39:54.022 --> 39:56.065
Good to use for playing music.

39:56.766 --> 40:01.954
Yeah, I had someone ask me about them at one point, said that they were out of print, and

40:03.571 --> 40:04.673
Not really.

40:04.693 --> 40:05.013
Not really.

40:06.095 --> 40:06.816
Take my word for it.

40:07.076 --> 40:09.740
I've got two complete sets in the basement.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.203
Thank you very much, Alan, for being with us.

40:11.223 --> 40:12.064
We'll see you again soon.

40:12.204 --> 40:12.785
Thanks, Mike.

40:12.805 --> 40:17.051
And we open the phones next on the Talk Station, AM 980 WRC.

40:22.219 --> 40:26.245
Dr. Lee Brown, the nation's drug policy chief, announces a new war on drugs.

40:26.285 --> 40:30.692
He talks about it on Capital Viewpoint, Saturday night at 9 on the Talk Station.

40:31.347 --> 40:35.164
W R C A M 9 A T
