WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:07.687
You're turning into real entrepreneurial capital.

00:07.947 --> 00:08.528
I am.

00:08.548 --> 00:11.731
No, no, no.

00:11.751 --> 00:13.613
All right, Dave, tell me about this book.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.736
Well, Nick, it'd be funny, right?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.703
Sure, Nick.

00:23.723 --> 00:24.644
You remember Iron John?

00:24.664 --> 00:25.605
You remember Iron John.

00:25.625 --> 00:26.106
Yeah, I do.

00:26.246 --> 00:27.787
I can't say that I read it, but I know it.

00:27.807 --> 00:29.329
No one read it, I hope, you know.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.085
But I'm looking at these guys.

00:31.105 --> 00:31.906
A lot of people bought it.

00:32.027 --> 00:32.868
A lot of people bought it.

00:33.309 --> 00:34.110
Think about a lot of books.

00:34.671 --> 00:37.194
You don't know that anybody ever actually reads.

00:37.675 --> 00:43.504
I mean, the ultimate example, I think, being Thin Thighs and Thirty Days, which is a book that I think everybody in America bought.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.408
You didn't write every woman.

00:46.449 --> 00:50.134
I didn't notice America's thighs getting thinner.

00:51.336 --> 00:53.579
But with Iron John... How about Stomachs?

00:53.700 --> 00:53.860
Yeah.

00:55.502 --> 00:57.966
Abs of Steel, all those books.

00:59.026 --> 01:08.055
I was looking at the men's movement thing and all this talk about men needing to get in touch with their deep inner selves.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.258
And I'm thinking, what deep inner selves?

01:10.278 --> 01:12.400
And I don't know anybody who's got a deep inner self.

01:12.540 --> 01:21.129
I hang around with guys all my life, and I've always found that when we're really, really talking about what we really feel, it usually is pretty shallow.

01:21.189 --> 01:27.936
So I decided I could write a book about it, kind of counteract the whole men's movement thing,

01:28.405 --> 01:36.495
and at the same time do something good for humanity, which is lower women... Well, I mean, that's incidental, of course.

01:36.515 --> 01:42.722
I don't mind doing actual harm for humanity either, but lower women's expectations about guys.

01:43.203 --> 01:58.041
Lower their... Well, yeah, my feeling is that too many books try to make both men and women, males and females, understand each other better, and it's time we accepted that guys will never understand anything better because they don't really care too much

01:58.274 --> 02:03.579
The key will be to get women who do care to accept that they're in a relationship with a guy.

02:03.599 --> 02:13.689
They should view it as not so much two members of the same species trying to get along, but they, women, intelligence-sensitive, thoughtful beings, and Labrador retrievers would be a better analogy for the guy.

02:14.249 --> 02:15.971
I have a laugh, by the way.

02:16.011 --> 02:16.552
Great sweet creature.

02:16.612 --> 02:17.152
Great dogs.

02:17.873 --> 02:19.334
I love Labrador retrievers.

02:19.354 --> 02:23.278
Well, picture a Labrador retriever that's learned how to operate a remote control, and you have a guy.

02:25.020 --> 02:25.260
That's good.

02:27.434 --> 02:30.279
That's the basic premise of it, yeah.

02:31.441 --> 02:32.382
Is it easy to be funny?

02:33.244 --> 02:35.507
Well, I think it's hard to be funny.

02:35.648 --> 02:38.332
I think a lot of people are funny when you talk to them.

02:39.955 --> 02:44.963
In fact, I know many, many people who are far funnier than I am when you talk to them.

02:45.203 --> 02:46.806
I think it's very hard to write funny.

02:47.086 --> 02:49.871
A lot of people try it and fail horribly.

02:49.911 --> 02:52.395
I'm sure you've met many, many people who are

02:53.742 --> 02:59.511
or great fun to talk to, but humor that fails in writing fails pretty badly, worse than Elvis than the other kind.

03:00.171 --> 03:07.382
Likewise, if you meet humor writers, you'll note that even though they may have a good sense of humor, a lot of them are not particularly funny to talk to.

03:07.422 --> 03:10.427
In fact, they can be kind of morose, serious people.

03:10.767 --> 03:19.480
So I think it's this kind of weird skill that people develop where you combine

03:20.523 --> 03:29.936
You have to have a good sense of humor, but you also have to have this real kind of driven mind.

03:30.857 --> 03:33.781
You're driven to do something that's utterly worthless, really.

03:33.821 --> 03:35.984
You're not trying to write anything great or important or significant.

03:36.004 --> 03:37.125
You're just trying to make people laugh.

03:37.626 --> 03:42.012
But that's hard, so you have to really think it's important and serious, and not too many people do.

03:42.032 --> 03:47.960
Most people think when they try to write humor, they figure it's got to be easy, and then they produce crappy humor.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.602
What kind of pressure...

03:50.071 --> 03:52.295
I mean, now, you talk about syndication.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.840
You must be in, what, how many hundreds?

03:54.860 --> 03:57.504
It's around somewhere between 300 and 400 papers.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.186
300 and 400 papers.

03:58.206 --> 03:58.306
Yeah.

03:58.646 --> 03:59.748
And you're distributed by whom?

03:59.989 --> 04:04.657
Well, Knight Ritter is the main one, and then also Tribune Media Services.

04:04.837 --> 04:06.761
So you can actually cross-pollinate like that?

04:06.901 --> 04:11.269
Well, what it is is Knight Ritter only sells – Tribune Media Services sells –

04:11.705 --> 04:13.667
This is a business question.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.568
A business question.

04:14.628 --> 04:16.250
Tribune Media Service, Knight Ritter.

04:16.551 --> 04:19.834
What if Knight Ritter wanted to pick up my column for some of their papers, for instance?

04:21.116 --> 04:23.038
Could I still keep my other papers for myself?

04:23.399 --> 04:25.461
Yes, as long as they're not Knight Ritter clients.

04:25.501 --> 04:36.414
The way it works with me is Knight Ritter syndicates my column to anybody who buys a Knight Ritter wire, but there are some papers who don't buy the whole wire who would still like to get my column.

04:36.434 --> 04:37.695
Do they pay you a flat rate?

04:38.485 --> 04:39.666
Then it gets negotiated.

04:39.766 --> 04:41.548
Oh, Knight Ritter does.

04:41.568 --> 04:41.848
Yes.

04:42.268 --> 04:44.310
But it's, yes.

04:45.692 --> 04:46.632
But they just changed it.

04:46.692 --> 04:48.594
Now it's pretty much based on the number of papers.

04:48.954 --> 04:50.055
Okay.

04:50.075 --> 04:57.883
But for a long time, it was pretty much a flat rate through them, and then any additional papers, that was based traditional syndicate arrangement.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.766
I'm talking about UPI, which is picking me up, especially for foreign stuff, but I don't even know how this is.

05:01.786 --> 05:04.168
You'd have to find out how they're going to work it, because they'll have to know who's.

05:04.188 --> 05:06.450
But they have this thing called, you know, special buy.

05:06.490 --> 05:07.311
Yeah.

05:07.426 --> 05:09.489
And I think it's like on the honor system.

05:10.510 --> 05:10.970
I see.

05:10.990 --> 05:14.114
Where it says, you know, if you want to use this, contact me.

05:14.174 --> 05:15.896
If I get 50 papers on my own, they're mine.

05:15.936 --> 05:16.757
I don't have to.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.099
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:18.119 --> 05:21.063
If they get UPI and you had them before, I mean, I don't know.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.424
You'd have to work that out.

05:22.504 --> 05:22.825
I'm sorry.

05:22.845 --> 05:23.526
Let's go back to your.

05:23.546 --> 05:24.507
But definitely you should.

05:24.627 --> 05:27.831
But anyways, my point is three or four hundred.

05:27.851 --> 05:28.612
Yeah, something like that.

05:28.892 --> 05:30.374
A lot of these are small papers.

05:30.474 --> 05:31.535
I love the small papers.

05:32.216 --> 05:33.277
Do you hear from these people?

05:33.758 --> 05:34.199
Oh, yeah.

05:34.259 --> 05:35.140
I hear from everybody.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.062
Well, here, this over here.

05:37.227 --> 05:41.693
See, this amount of stuff, this is all... That's correspondence.

05:41.713 --> 05:42.534
Letters from readers.

05:42.594 --> 05:43.696
And you answer them?

05:43.716 --> 05:44.617
Yeah, I answer them.

05:44.637 --> 05:49.344
I have little cards made up that I answer them with.

05:49.364 --> 05:51.687
And I'm a master at writing a one-word answer.

05:51.847 --> 05:55.993
Thanks, or moo, if it was a cow-related letter.

05:56.854 --> 05:59.398
Do you scrupulously answer them?

05:59.418 --> 06:01.541
I do, unless it's, you know, completely insane.

06:01.581 --> 06:03.343
Well, so I rules that about 90% of my men.

06:03.644 --> 06:04.585
No, I...

06:05.020 --> 06:09.425
I read it all and answer most of it.

06:10.005 --> 06:13.589
It's a wonderful thing, first of all, because I get a lot of stuff from readers.

06:14.150 --> 06:17.613
If a toilet explodes anywhere in the world, I will hear about it.

06:17.953 --> 06:21.477
I will be like the central clearinghouse for that story worldwide.

06:22.518 --> 06:27.904
But also, you get an idea of what people think is funny and what they've done, what they're like, who your readers are.

06:28.164 --> 06:29.666
It's like the vital signs.

06:29.686 --> 06:31.888
You can't write into a vacuum.

06:32.172 --> 06:39.382
Exactly, and I think it's a big danger in colonizing journalism in general.

06:39.443 --> 06:45.131
You know, you start to associate with other journalists and other columnists, and you actually think that's part of the world.

06:45.331 --> 06:47.174
You know, the classic Washington, D.C.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.858
syndrome, where you believe Washington, D.C.

06:49.878 --> 06:53.863
in any way reflects the planet Earth, which, of course, it doesn't, you know.

06:54.484 --> 06:59.672
So I like to keep reading what people out there actually are interested in or think is funny.

06:59.992 --> 07:01.234
And it always amazes me.

07:02.176 --> 07:05.441
what it is, it turns out, to really matter to people.

07:05.842 --> 07:10.590
Like, I once wrote a column, simple column, about dumb song lyrics.

07:10.610 --> 07:18.222
I mean, you know, there's no particular... And I just opened this dam, you know, this incredible rage poured out.

07:18.242 --> 07:19.885
You know this song about the horse with no name?

07:20.065 --> 07:20.866
I hate that song!

07:20.906 --> 07:23.931
You know, blood dripping off the letters.

07:24.232 --> 07:29.236
You never know what people are going to be excited about, but it almost never is the federal budget deficit.

07:29.557 --> 07:31.638
Almost never what we're talking about on the front page.

07:31.659 --> 07:39.345
Now, do you take these, you said, I don't want to paraphrase you, but do you take these seriously?

07:39.525 --> 07:40.466
I mean, is this?

07:40.486 --> 07:41.227
I take the letter.

07:41.247 --> 07:41.807
This isn't, I mean, this.

07:41.827 --> 07:42.588
Oh, well, it's my job.

07:42.608 --> 07:45.991
That's why we're talking about the book, obviously, but I'm talking, you know, I'll deal with the book.

07:46.371 --> 07:48.733
No, I understand.

07:48.753 --> 07:49.834
Do I take the letter seriously?

07:49.874 --> 07:52.417
No, do you take the column seriously?

07:52.437 --> 07:53.918
Yeah, I mean, in the sense that,

07:54.370 --> 08:04.700
You know, like if you were a clown, a circus clown, you know, and you're going to take a pie in the face or squirt somebody with a flower, you're going to take that seriously.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.923
You're going to want to take the pie in the face so it looks really just right funny.

08:08.344 --> 08:09.925
You know, you're going to work it all out.

08:09.945 --> 08:10.786
And then when you do it, what?

08:10.806 --> 08:11.867
You're doing a stupid thing.

08:12.268 --> 08:14.009
But you're a professional clown, you know.

08:14.089 --> 08:14.850
That's kind of me.

08:15.551 --> 08:18.714
I have no illusion that what I'm writing is serious or important.

08:18.734 --> 08:23.719
And I know if I stopped writing it, the world would go on exactly as before and maybe even better.

08:24.121 --> 08:36.914
But I do take, if I'm going to write about, you know, guys going off a ski jump in a canoe, by God, I will make it as clear and accurate and funny an account of it as I can.

08:39.056 --> 08:48.846
I guess when I started a question about the numbers of papers, I mean, the pressure must be enormous to really produce something.

08:49.535 --> 08:50.096
That's funny.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.400
I write one column a week.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.562
I write other stuff, but I write one column per week.

08:55.883 --> 09:04.473
Yeah, I do feel pressure, but I think it's better if you're a columnist than if you're an author of books and nothing else.

09:05.134 --> 09:12.423
Because if you're a columnist, yeah, there is the pressure to do it, but then once you did it, it's done and you get to do another one the next week.

09:12.823 --> 09:16.167
If you write a book, like if you're Norman Mailer and you come out with a book every three years,

09:16.653 --> 09:18.455
Every reviewer in the world reviews it.

09:18.615 --> 09:19.416
It's a big review.

09:19.437 --> 09:20.918
It's the major review that week.

09:21.339 --> 09:25.744
About two-thirds of the reviewers are going to be looking to shoot you down because you're Norman.

09:25.765 --> 09:29.730
And then you're going to have to live with that for the next couple of years, whatever you did.

09:30.230 --> 09:39.181
The beauty of doing both, of course, is that you do, like Buddy Meyer is a jazz musician, and he writes things too, and he said that.

09:39.202 --> 09:41.665
The beauty about music is that the response is immediate.

09:41.685 --> 09:42.225
Exactly.

09:42.345 --> 09:44.348
I really envy...

09:44.564 --> 09:47.587
musicians, stand-up comics.

09:47.727 --> 09:48.988
Yeah, you do it, it's done.

09:49.008 --> 09:50.990
And journalism to a degree gives you that.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.111
Yeah, more so than books.

09:52.131 --> 09:53.633
Because you're out there at least every week.

09:53.753 --> 09:54.193
That's right.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.015
You know, you mentioned Mailer.

09:56.035 --> 09:57.676
It's not three years, it's five years.

09:57.776 --> 09:58.697
Yeah, it's overdue.

09:58.737 --> 09:59.618
It's supposed to be, yeah.

10:00.019 --> 10:03.902
Hey, Harlot's Ghost was 91, so this thing is four years of the making.

10:04.143 --> 10:09.968
Yeah, and it's going to be this huge publishing event, way out of proportion to the amount of books it will sell.

10:10.128 --> 10:12.090
I mean, it may sell well, but it's not going to sell like

10:12.070 --> 10:35.766
look at bob carrow's piece in the new york hamster if you had a chance i did not see the times well it's a record piece it's about his writing up in the new york public library working seven eight years in a book in this little room you know i mean you wonder i know and if it's not really blow this i know what i've been doing i mean i could be like a real out here they're gonna make fun of me and and one critic a critic who spent maybe

10:35.830 --> 10:37.832
Two hours will be with your book.

10:37.852 --> 10:38.293
Exactly.

10:38.493 --> 10:47.222
Can write a review that will really... In 90 minutes, and if it's some young hot shot that really wants your ass on his staff... Exactly.

10:47.482 --> 10:48.744
You can be hurt.

10:50.345 --> 10:53.569
Being a book person, you know, I've been writing about books for 20 years.

10:54.550 --> 11:05.061
I reviewed a book once in the New York Times, and the book really was... I was a very well-known author, and he wrote a letter.

11:05.429 --> 11:10.778
I was absolutely right with the review, but I wounded this guy, and I lost my taste for it.

11:10.858 --> 11:12.521
I said, I... You don't want to do that again.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.903
I never want to do that again.

11:13.944 --> 11:15.566
I never want to do that again.

11:15.767 --> 11:18.772
I mean, you could feel the pain coming out.

11:18.952 --> 11:23.059
I said, being in the New York Times, I heard that book.

11:23.079 --> 11:23.500
I know.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.445
I... I said, never again.

11:26.465 --> 11:27.426
I'd rather not do it.

11:27.547 --> 11:28.348
I just...

11:28.767 --> 11:31.292
You know, unless it's Madonna with its version.

11:31.312 --> 11:32.654
Right, in which case, I'll help you.

11:34.057 --> 11:35.499
She's not a book writer.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.765
And that's not a book that she came out with.

11:38.846 --> 11:40.669
And she came out with it the same time I came out with it.

11:40.689 --> 11:42.652
And you couldn't even look at it because it was in plastic.

11:42.693 --> 11:43.314
You had to buy it.

11:43.815 --> 11:46.219
You're going to buy a record and you can't listen to it anymore.

11:46.368 --> 11:50.954
I particularly resented the Madonna book because it came out the same week one of my books came out.

11:50.994 --> 11:55.799
So I went on tour, and the first question I always got was, so what do you think of Madonna's book?

11:55.819 --> 11:57.441
I ended up signing Madonna's book.

11:57.461 --> 12:00.986
But I used to, long ago, occasionally write book reviews.

12:02.327 --> 12:05.952
You know, a new book review editor, like Becky Sinclair, now at the Times.

12:06.012 --> 12:07.073
She's gone now.

12:07.393 --> 12:07.834
That's right.

12:07.854 --> 12:08.995
There was some big flaps.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.557
No, it was five years.

12:10.577 --> 12:12.499
They say it wasn't a flap, but it was five years.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.842
You basically get five years on that gig.

12:14.862 --> 12:15.463
And then you're out.

12:15.713 --> 12:22.665
and it's Chip McGrath in there, which is really concerning me.

12:23.807 --> 12:33.763
I did write some reviews, and sometimes I was picked to write them because people knew I could be a real attack dog, so I could make fun of things.

12:33.783 --> 12:37.249
There's a difference between making fun and mocking them.

12:37.567 --> 12:40.329
Don't you agree with that?

12:40.470 --> 12:40.750
Yes.

12:41.150 --> 12:44.393
I hate a mocking reader.

12:44.413 --> 12:45.354
I was not vicious.

12:46.495 --> 12:50.118
I never mocked that book I was mentioning either.

12:51.359 --> 12:52.801
It's the same as you said.

12:52.821 --> 12:54.102
I just stopped wanting to do it.

12:55.163 --> 13:04.611
Once you have a book come out and you experience the reviewing process and everything, it's not that I think it's wrong for people to review books.

13:04.831 --> 13:05.532
It's just that

13:06.862 --> 13:11.890
I don't think I could do it anymore, because I'd want it always to be some book I liked, or I wouldn't want to do it.

13:11.910 --> 13:17.138
That's the beauty of my column, by the way, is that people say, why is everything you write about you always like?

13:18.060 --> 13:25.912
And I say, because I choose to do the things I want to do, and I choose not to do the things that bore me, or that I don't want to do.

13:26.052 --> 13:27.094
Yeah, yeah.

13:27.114 --> 13:27.975
I mean, it's my column.

13:27.995 --> 13:28.396
It's mine.

13:28.436 --> 13:31.481
I don't have a fairness doctrine here.

13:31.501 --> 13:32.482
Yeah, exactly.

13:33.384 --> 13:34.185
It's whatever.

13:35.228 --> 13:38.411
One of my papers really wants to know about the TV show.

13:38.652 --> 13:38.932
Sure.

13:39.372 --> 13:41.374
Tell me about that and how you feel about it.

13:41.394 --> 13:48.862
Well, the TV show is, it's really kind of, the TV show is way out there on the West Coast, and I'm way back here on the East Coast.

13:49.242 --> 13:54.808
We're separated in many ways, but it's based really loosely on two books I wrote.

13:54.888 --> 13:56.770
The connection is the premise.

13:57.151 --> 13:59.833
The guy in the TV show is a human writer who lives in Miami.

14:00.334 --> 14:01.335
I'm a human writer.

14:01.355 --> 14:01.835
Dame Dave.

14:01.855 --> 14:03.497
Dame Dave, who lives in Miami.

14:03.865 --> 14:06.728
Although the guy on the TV show has two sons.

14:06.748 --> 14:07.889
Kind of narrows it down just a little bit.

14:07.909 --> 14:10.552
Named Dave Barry, actually.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.893
On the TV show, he has two sons.

14:11.933 --> 14:15.216
I have only one son, which means for tax purposes, I can claim three sons.

14:15.336 --> 14:17.539
That's the one big advantage.

14:18.860 --> 14:22.544
But, you know, my books, my columns have no plot whatsoever.

14:22.864 --> 14:24.966
So they ran out of plots early on.

14:25.046 --> 14:26.668
They write their own show out there.

14:27.088 --> 14:27.649
I like it.

14:27.889 --> 14:28.670
I enjoy the show.

14:28.690 --> 14:29.931
Which two books is it based on?

14:29.951 --> 14:32.033
It's based on Dave Barry turns 40,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.803
and Dave Barry's Greatest Hits.

14:34.845 --> 14:36.288
And I liked the show.

14:36.669 --> 14:37.230
I met the people.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.272
I was even on it once.

14:38.853 --> 14:41.278
I played the part of a person with no acting ability.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.461
And I was very good in that role.

14:42.922 --> 14:43.683
I was a natural.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.431
And... Was it known that it was you?

14:47.571 --> 14:47.912
Yeah.

14:47.932 --> 14:51.579
Yeah, they... I have to confess, I don't watch... No, that's okay.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.042
That's really...

14:53.478 --> 14:57.824
Yeah, I had to play a scene with Harry Anderson where... Who I think is terrific.

14:57.844 --> 14:58.525
He is very good.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.166
I liked him.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.529
I mean, I met him, and I really liked him.

15:01.709 --> 15:08.038
He's every bit... He's just a nice, down-to-earth, regular person, which you always hear said about people, but he is.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.725
And so I enjoyed that a lot.

15:13.085 --> 15:15.408
But it really has very little to do with my actual life.

15:15.468 --> 15:18.152
I mean, a lot of people think I write it.

15:18.368 --> 15:21.372
And I'm thinking if I wrote it, then I wouldn't be a humor columnist anymore.

15:21.392 --> 15:22.753
I'd be a guy writing a show about it.

15:23.735 --> 15:24.816
You'd make that a ton more money, though.

15:24.996 --> 15:25.697
I probably would.

15:25.857 --> 15:26.538
I probably would.

15:26.578 --> 15:29.422
They do send me a royalty check, I have to say.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.923
They pay me a great check.

15:30.943 --> 15:39.774
But so it's kind of... There are people, I guess, who believe that it... Well, does it change... People would believe that you write it.

15:39.794 --> 15:42.718
But did it change expectations for the column at all?

15:42.778 --> 15:43.238
Not really.

15:43.419 --> 15:44.260
Not that I've noticed.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.182
I mean, a lot of people, I think, who...

15:48.558 --> 15:51.762
who read the column don't even know the television show is based on it.

15:51.782 --> 15:54.905
I think a lot of people who watch the television show don't even know there's a real column.

15:55.145 --> 15:56.387
They probably don't read.

15:56.407 --> 15:57.208
Yeah, that's right.

15:57.568 --> 15:58.549
They're television viewers.

16:00.231 --> 16:03.475
But I haven't noticed that I haven't heard anything.

16:03.835 --> 16:13.165
The one big change in my life has been that at least once per day, and sometimes as many as 50 times per day, somebody says to me, hey, you don't look a bit like Harry Anderson.

16:13.185 --> 16:14.347
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

16:14.587 --> 16:17.350
And I have to smile and pretend I've never heard that before.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.315
Oh, aren't you that guy from Night Court?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.396
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

16:20.757 --> 16:25.663
Speaking of Night Court, John Larroquette is one of the people in my own book, who's a fanatical book collector.

16:25.783 --> 16:26.304
Is he really?

16:27.145 --> 16:27.646
Is he really?

16:27.946 --> 16:28.407
Oh, yeah.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.029
Very interesting story, too.

16:30.049 --> 16:31.311
He's got the four Emmys.

16:31.631 --> 16:34.555
He's a really interesting guy, I think, and a great comic actor.

16:34.575 --> 16:37.098
I got a very nice profile in my book.

16:37.118 --> 16:37.980
I like him a lot.

16:38.020 --> 16:39.602
I mean, he's like his... He's very nice.

16:39.702 --> 16:40.543
He seems very smart.

16:40.603 --> 16:42.065
Very nice to my wife, who is with me.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.610
I mean, just a gentleman knew me when we were out there.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.472
How long has the show been playing?

16:47.654 --> 16:50.979
This coming season will be its third season, so it's doing well.

16:51.299 --> 16:52.181
And it's rated well?

16:52.401 --> 16:53.362
It rates well.

16:53.382 --> 16:54.564
They pick it up for the whole year.

16:55.225 --> 16:56.066
When network is it?

16:56.086 --> 16:57.468
I'm asking some questions.

16:57.528 --> 16:59.711
No, no, CBS.

16:59.872 --> 17:01.454
CBS, Monday nights, check your local listings.

17:02.315 --> 17:13.932
I'm switching from the... Talk about the television shows there while I think of where I was going here.

17:14.857 --> 17:17.520
Well, I've said virtually everything I have to say about the television show.

17:17.540 --> 17:18.041
Do you watch it?

17:18.542 --> 17:19.443
I do watch it, yeah.

17:19.543 --> 17:21.866
I don't always see it because I'm traveling a lot, but I try to take it.

17:21.886 --> 17:24.169
Is it a representation of your own life?

17:24.269 --> 17:24.450
No.

17:25.130 --> 17:26.232
Totally imaginary.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.815
Yeah, I mean, as I say, the premise is the same.

17:29.436 --> 17:33.962
And every now and then they'll... The premise is... That it's a human writer living in Miami.

17:34.443 --> 17:37.486
But every now and then... Are you a single guy or whatever?

17:37.507 --> 17:38.167
No, no, he's married.

17:38.187 --> 17:38.628
He's married?

17:38.748 --> 17:39.529
Yeah, he has two kids.

17:39.589 --> 17:40.030
I have one.

17:40.290 --> 17:40.631
Okay.

17:40.791 --> 17:41.392
He has one dog.

17:41.412 --> 17:41.832
I have two.

17:42.173 --> 17:42.653
How about that?

17:43.875 --> 17:44.796
What kinds of dogs?

17:44.877 --> 17:45.798
I have stupid.

17:46.239 --> 17:46.859
Two very stupid.

17:46.879 --> 17:47.800
One big, one little boat.

17:47.961 --> 17:50.804
Total combined working brain cells, four or five maybe tops.

17:51.365 --> 17:52.506
I'm going to get the very nice dog.

17:52.586 --> 17:55.890
One's like a mixed lab, and one's a little thing.

17:56.190 --> 17:56.731
Where are you from?

17:57.152 --> 18:00.576
I'm from, I grew up in suburban New York City, Armont, New York.

18:00.616 --> 18:01.337
You're a New Yorker.

18:01.777 --> 18:04.841
And I went to Haverford College, and then I went down to Miami.

18:04.861 --> 18:05.241
Pennsylvania?

18:05.261 --> 18:05.882
In Pennsylvania.

18:05.902 --> 18:06.703
Where are Pennsylvania?

18:06.983 --> 18:08.024
Haverford, H-A-V.

18:08.044 --> 18:08.926
Is it near Allentown?

18:09.106 --> 18:09.366
No.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.621
No, well, it's on the main line.

18:11.661 --> 18:12.202
Philadelphia.

18:12.222 --> 18:12.903
Allentown's up here.

18:12.923 --> 18:14.324
Philadelphia's down here.

18:14.404 --> 18:16.267
I'll plug that in.

18:16.427 --> 18:17.728
About 90 miles from Allentown.

18:17.748 --> 18:18.990
No, no, no, but I tell them.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.912
They want to know when they're in Pennsylvania.

18:20.972 --> 18:21.953
I've been to Allentown.

18:22.073 --> 18:25.317
My first publisher was Rodale Press, which is in Emmaus.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.019
That was your first publisher?

18:27.039 --> 18:28.540
Yeah, and I used to hang out in Allentown.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.241
They do cookbooks.

18:29.401 --> 18:29.782
They do.

18:29.862 --> 18:30.302
Yeah, I know.

18:30.322 --> 18:31.824
I was their only humor writer ever.

18:31.884 --> 18:34.007
That's funny.

18:34.808 --> 18:35.669
I know them out there.

18:35.689 --> 18:36.369
They're nice people.

18:36.429 --> 18:37.010
Yeah, they are.

18:37.090 --> 18:37.851
They're nice people.

18:38.337 --> 18:41.061
Barbara Mason used to work for a little Dale Press.

18:41.201 --> 18:41.502
She did.

18:41.522 --> 18:42.423
I don't think she still does.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.544
I don't think so.

18:43.565 --> 18:44.886
She did pretty well as a writer.

18:44.926 --> 18:45.808
I think she's done, yeah.

18:45.828 --> 18:46.629
She doesn't need that.

18:47.811 --> 18:50.154
And so then you went to Florida when?

18:50.655 --> 18:52.477
In 1986, I moved down there.

18:52.958 --> 18:53.859
Not a long time ago.

18:54.761 --> 18:57.364
So all this really kind of happened to you very quickly, didn't it?

18:57.384 --> 18:57.505
Yeah.

18:58.045 --> 19:01.290
I was in my mid-30s, and I had left journalism.

19:01.692 --> 19:04.515
Now, were you a straight journalist, so to speak?

19:04.915 --> 19:05.035
Yeah.

19:05.495 --> 19:05.956
Reporter type?

19:06.136 --> 19:06.496
Yeah.

19:06.636 --> 19:18.467
I was doing general assignment reporting for the Associated Press, which I quit in 1976, and I spent the next seven years teaching effective writing seminars to business people.

19:18.507 --> 19:24.412
I traveled around the country because I needed a job, and I had a lot of free time on the job, so I wrote columns.

19:24.432 --> 19:25.954
And you were down in Florida at this point?

19:25.974 --> 19:26.154
Nope.

19:26.274 --> 19:29.657
I was still in Pennsylvania, living in Philadelphia, suburban Philadelphia.

19:30.076 --> 19:49.586
a town called Westchester, two words, and I started, I was writing a column for the local paper, and very much like you, next, I got a couple of other papers interested in it, and then it started, then the Miami Herald started running it regularly, and a couple of other bigger papers.

19:49.746 --> 19:51.829
So you've never actually worked for the Herald?

19:52.049 --> 19:53.552
No, they hired me in 1983.

19:53.692 --> 19:59.020
They said, come work for us, and, you know, so I did.

19:59.303 --> 20:01.065
On staff, but I didn't want to move to Miami.

20:01.085 --> 20:04.949
So for the next three years, I lived in suburban Philadelphia.

20:05.009 --> 20:05.690
That's terrific.

20:05.710 --> 20:06.531
It was a great deal.

20:07.112 --> 20:10.576
But then I came to like Miami, believe it or not, and moved there on purpose.

20:10.716 --> 20:11.396
Like L.A.

20:11.416 --> 20:12.117
too, believe it or not.

20:12.137 --> 20:12.638
That's weird.

20:12.698 --> 20:13.479
That's very weird.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.463
So I moved to Miami in 1986, and I've been there since then.

20:17.723 --> 20:19.686
But I've worked for the Herald since 1983.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.508
Do you go in?

20:21.708 --> 20:27.114
I go in maybe once a week to get mail, to talk to people, but I work at home.

20:27.534 --> 20:28.095
How's Edna?

20:28.531 --> 20:29.793
Edna, I don't see Edna.

20:29.913 --> 20:31.875
Edna is no longer on the staff.

20:31.895 --> 20:34.479
I do see her around on the writing circuit.

20:34.499 --> 20:37.122
Edna is one of the Miamis.

20:37.142 --> 20:42.068
It's funny, Miami has a real, it's gotten to be a real literary.

20:42.108 --> 20:49.037
Carl Hyasson works for the paper, James Hall, Les Standiford, Paul Levine,

20:49.642 --> 20:58.116
Just a bunch of people living right in the Miami era, writing mostly crime novels about Miami, which God knows we could write millions of crime novels about Miami.

20:58.136 --> 20:59.718
Boston has a lot of crime novels.

20:59.738 --> 21:00.820
Sure, yeah, Robert Parker.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.182
Well, there are quite a few.

21:02.202 --> 21:05.407
There's Linda Barnes, there's Bob Parker, there's George Higgins.

21:05.427 --> 21:06.329
There's a couple of them.

21:06.349 --> 21:06.730
Oh, that's right.

21:06.750 --> 21:07.310
I forgot about George.

21:07.351 --> 21:08.953
He's a very Boston guy.

21:09.774 --> 21:13.561
Yeah, we have the same publishing home.

21:13.581 --> 21:14.502
Pushing 3 o'clock.

21:15.578 --> 21:15.878
Okay.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.982
Well, I told—we should probably start walking, at least.

21:18.002 --> 21:18.142
Okay.

21:18.483 --> 21:20.025
You want to sign my book?

21:20.045 --> 21:21.387
Is it for you, Nick?

21:21.407 --> 21:23.491
Of course it's for me.

21:23.531 --> 21:23.851
All right.

21:23.891 --> 21:24.432
I got a pen.

21:24.452 --> 21:25.193
Yeah.

21:25.213 --> 21:28.018
This is how my own book started.

21:28.278 --> 21:31.183
So what kinds of things did you report on, Greg and David?

21:31.584 --> 21:32.625
I was in general.

21:32.745 --> 21:36.091
I mean, you know, I went to school board meetings, sewage board meetings.

21:36.111 --> 21:37.653
I knew more about sewage treatment.

21:37.773 --> 21:40.177
What's the difference between sewage and sewerage?

21:40.698 --> 21:40.958
You know?

21:41.139 --> 21:41.940
Oh, I do know.

21:42.275 --> 21:43.456
Sewage is the pipe.

21:43.496 --> 21:44.978
Sewage is the stuff flowing through the pipe.

21:44.998 --> 21:45.298
Sewage is shit.

21:45.319 --> 21:46.700
Sewage takes it away and treats it.

21:46.780 --> 21:47.301
There you go.

21:47.321 --> 21:48.662
How did you do that?

21:48.742 --> 21:51.546
One of my first enemies told me that.

21:51.566 --> 21:52.086
Okay, see that?

21:52.967 --> 21:54.609
I got it wrong once in a story.

21:54.629 --> 21:56.672
And the guy wrote back, sewage is shit.

21:56.912 --> 21:58.454
Sewage takes it away and treats it.

22:00.276 --> 22:02.418
So you never say a sewerage treatment plant.

22:02.518 --> 22:03.800
No, because I need to be treating pipes.

22:03.840 --> 22:04.320
That's right.

22:05.722 --> 22:07.624
Please don't write that.

22:08.045 --> 22:08.485
I'm not.

22:10.828 --> 22:10.948
I'm...

22:12.616 --> 22:14.320
I think we got some stuff here.

22:15.423 --> 22:16.245
We'll be fine.

22:16.265 --> 22:16.826
We'll be fine.

22:16.886 --> 22:20.154
I'm used to doing interviews with Nadine Gordon.

22:20.174 --> 22:21.076
Nick, you're a pro.

22:21.638 --> 22:22.279
I try.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.502
I try.

22:23.522 --> 22:24.685
God bless, I try.

22:26.409 --> 22:27.913
You know what I like about this interview?

22:27.933 --> 22:30.118
It's going to be very easy to try.
