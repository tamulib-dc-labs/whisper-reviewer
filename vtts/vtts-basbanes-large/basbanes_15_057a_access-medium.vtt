00:02.613 --> 00:03.434
Stephen Jay Gould.

00:06.498 --> 00:08.461
Six shelves of baseball books.

00:09.222 --> 00:10.224
Three kinds of books here.

00:10.244 --> 00:16.092
My wife's art books, my baseball books, and baseballs, and my antiquarian natural history.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.596
Quite a place we should point out.

00:18.616 --> 00:20.979
Well, I don't know what's... Yeah, I mean, sure.

00:21.620 --> 00:22.121
Why not?

00:22.141 --> 00:26.747
I don't know what's... The thing about the ball is I'm not a collector in the sense that I don't.

00:27.419 --> 00:31.765
I mean, I'm really not in one important use of the term.

00:31.825 --> 00:40.497
That is, I don't amass by purchase or with some sense of value or worth.

00:40.938 --> 00:42.700
The books I have, and that's just your books.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.164
I might say I use every one of them every month.

00:45.204 --> 00:49.530
I don't get things unless I might use them, unless I want them for use.

00:50.291 --> 00:53.055
I mean, similarly with the baseballs, I would never go out and

00:54.082 --> 00:56.344
buy a ball or anything.

00:56.464 --> 00:57.926
Except you have eight of them, though.

00:57.946 --> 01:02.570
No, I mean, but they all came, I mean, every one of them has a story.

01:02.610 --> 01:07.855
The Branca and Larson balls, those are probably the only purchased ones, but they were a gift.

01:07.875 --> 01:10.077
There was an honorarium for a talk I gave.

01:10.698 --> 01:15.122
The DiMaggio ball, the second from the left, my father, DiMaggio, hit it in 1950.

01:15.202 --> 01:16.243
My father caught it.

01:16.263 --> 01:16.463
Come on.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.425
Oh, yeah, I was sitting right next to him.

01:18.865 --> 01:21.448
And we mailed it to him and he signed it.

01:21.468 --> 01:22.789
So was your father Steve

01:22.988 --> 01:24.851
So is this to Steve, your father?

01:24.871 --> 01:28.195
No, no, the first DiMaggio ball, the one that has the signature.

01:28.215 --> 01:38.169
The second one, you know, 40 years later when I was very ill, a friend of mine, the old book publisher, Bill Freeman, was a golfing buddy of DiMaggio.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.235
He didn't know I had that first ball, but he was a pal of DiMaggio.

01:42.375 --> 01:45.479
We used to golf together, so he got DiMaggio to sign it for me.

01:45.900 --> 01:46.701
It was really sweet.

01:47.508 --> 01:53.456
And the one from Hank Aaron was given to me when I gave a talk at Spelman College, the black college in Atlanta.

01:54.397 --> 01:57.541
And the one from Mickey Mantle was when I interviewed him.

01:58.382 --> 02:00.005
So they all have stories.

02:00.145 --> 02:01.286
How about the Branca?

02:01.306 --> 02:02.007
How did you get the Branca?

02:02.027 --> 02:03.730
The Branca and the Larson were an honorary.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.312
Somebody gave him to me as an honorary.

02:05.332 --> 02:06.693
It was a surprise.

02:06.734 --> 02:08.796
No, the Larson is dated 56.

02:08.976 --> 02:09.998
That's the date.

02:10.018 --> 02:12.922
He just puts it down.

02:12.942 --> 02:15.826
The moment, the one crowning moment of his life.

02:16.246 --> 02:16.907
This new book,

02:17.056 --> 02:20.320
I'm working on is not about collecting at all.

02:20.360 --> 02:26.788
It's about books, book culture, libraries, texts.

02:27.689 --> 02:33.616
I'm interested in how books enter the canon.

02:33.736 --> 02:34.798
It's hard to say.

02:34.818 --> 02:43.168
It's a very exciting time, and we're interviewing all kinds of wonderful people, and we'll see where it goes.

02:43.208 --> 02:46.692
But I really am interested, I'm fascinated by the fact that

02:47.245 --> 02:48.166
that.

02:48.186 --> 03:05.226
You said a number of things, but the last time we spoke, you mentioned how there is a difference for you when you work with authentic documents, be they manuscripts as opposed to facsimiles, or first editions, that there really is something.

03:06.568 --> 03:07.529
Oh, yeah, sure.

03:08.430 --> 03:08.871
I don't know.

03:08.991 --> 03:11.594
It's a very deep thing.

03:11.634 --> 03:14.097
I guess not everybody feels it the same way, but there's

03:14.515 --> 03:24.227
There's something about authenticity that really, I don't know how to put it, just strikes some people.

03:24.547 --> 03:31.856
You go see the dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History, and they're real bones, almost all of them.

03:31.876 --> 03:38.984
You'd think that this is the bone that was 80 million years ago underlay the flesh of a real dinosaur.

03:39.505 --> 03:41.367
You go up to the Tyrrell Museum,

03:41.701 --> 04:10.476
has more material they have the real bones in the back rooms and almost everything is fiberglass and you say to yourself well it's very accurate and most people can't tell the difference but I know I'm a paleontologist this is fiberglass it looks exactly like a dinosaur bone but it's just a modern artifact so what it doesn't convey anything of the grandeur of it if I'm writing about Darwin and I'm holding a copy that

04:10.844 --> 04:13.809
It was published in his lifetime of his own books.

04:15.431 --> 04:16.513
I mean, is it a palpable book?

04:16.533 --> 04:17.715
Is it something?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.097
Sure, sure, definitely.

04:19.498 --> 04:20.319
Don't you feel it?

04:20.339 --> 04:21.401
Oh, of course.

04:21.421 --> 04:22.924
Well, I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

04:23.585 --> 04:28.072
And of course, in natural history, so many of the books are also enormously beautiful.

04:30.496 --> 04:34.102
Now, you say you're not a collector, but you certainly are a bibliophile, I think.

04:34.382 --> 04:36.666
Yeah, well, sure.

04:37.979 --> 04:43.366
Tell me if you would, but we don't have to get up, but tell me about some of the things that you have and why you acquired them.

04:43.386 --> 04:53.459
Now, you said earlier that you basically get things that you can use in your work or that help you, and there's research tools.

04:55.142 --> 04:56.343
Yeah, of course.

04:56.403 --> 05:06.737
Is that basically how the collection just developed from things I might use, but of course, as an essayist, I do have a very broad

05:07.477 --> 05:20.978
field, and as a professional paleontologist, because I have a whole history of paleontology, which goes back to the beginnings of modern science, 17th century, even a couple of 16th century things.

05:21.800 --> 05:29.813
And then I've got all of evolutionary theory, which just about covers all of biology.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.657
So I have these, and then a lot of geology, which

05:34.139 --> 05:56.793
I have this subject area that includes most of the natural history of sciences, including a lot of anthropology, all of which I write about, as an essayist at least, and that includes some of the most beautiful and famous kinds of publishing, particularly the 18th and 19th centuries.

05:57.674 --> 06:01.159
Do you use that kind of as an excuse to get published?

06:02.742 --> 06:04.384
Yeah, but I suppose.

06:04.524 --> 06:10.672
But if I were just a more general bibliophile, there's so many other things one could collect.

06:10.752 --> 06:15.518
I also love literature and history, but I don't, I mean, I never go out.

06:16.079 --> 06:17.821
But now you wrote, right, I brought it with me.

06:18.081 --> 06:19.343
This is a true bibliophile.

06:19.363 --> 06:24.809
I wrote two of your books, which I particularly like, The Finders Keepers 1 and Time's Arrow.

06:24.950 --> 06:32.479
And I think they both, certainly one is about collecting in a very different, tell me about, about

06:32.611 --> 06:35.397
That book, for instance, what?

06:36.218 --> 06:36.980
Finders Keepers?

06:37.000 --> 06:37.721
Yeah.

06:37.741 --> 06:41.469
Well, I've done a lot of work with Rosamund Purcell.

06:42.652 --> 06:48.463
She's a very fine photographer with a very quirky sense of the macabre and the unusual.

06:49.205 --> 06:53.674
And she's fascinated by collecting traditions, particularly the older.

06:55.105 --> 06:56.107
Baroque traditions.

06:56.127 --> 07:15.696
You have such a difference between the Baroque age and the Cabinet of Wonders, where people went out and tried to get the most bizarre, the most unusual, the biggest, in which you just try and get one of everything.

07:26.527 --> 07:29.450
What is this book here?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.672
This is Calciolati.

07:31.692 --> 07:35.896
It's one of the 17th century collections.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.618
That's wonderful, isn't it?

07:38.198 --> 07:42.803
That's the grand old tradition of the Cabinet of Wonders.

07:45.745 --> 07:47.247
Did you read Larry Weschler's book?

07:47.487 --> 07:47.687
Yeah.

07:50.610 --> 07:52.652
Yeah, that's of course what he's writing about.

07:53.155 --> 07:56.099
He's like, employed a dwarf and a giant.

07:56.981 --> 07:57.822
Who does this?

07:58.683 --> 08:03.170
This is Cosby, who ended up with most of Albert Irvandi's collection.

08:05.053 --> 08:06.334
C-O-S-P.

08:07.016 --> 08:07.276
C-O-S-P-I.

08:07.396 --> 08:12.964
I don't know where.

08:13.064 --> 08:16.610
This is McCarthy, who had the Vatican collection.

08:17.351 --> 08:19.534
So these are books on...

08:20.662 --> 08:23.245
Natural history collections, yeah.

08:24.747 --> 08:28.052
And what would you say is the oldest one here?

08:30.274 --> 08:32.077
Gessner, 1551.

08:37.163 --> 08:40.968
Includes a rare 1719 appendix.

08:41.028 --> 08:42.410
Oh, look at that.

08:42.430 --> 08:43.151
That's wonderful.

08:43.171 --> 08:44.333
This is a different age.

08:44.513 --> 08:49.960
Once you get through the Baroque age, then you get into the 18th century, you get into the Enlightenment age.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.264
And what you want, then, is order and rationality.

08:54.526 --> 08:57.170
You have a whole different aesthetic in the collection.

08:57.190 --> 08:59.514
That's basically what Rosamund and I did in that.

08:59.534 --> 09:04.361
We went from Peter the Great, who was the last of the Roque collectors.

09:06.685 --> 09:07.225
I love that.

09:09.288 --> 09:17.601
You mentioned also in that book, where it's actually in Time Zero, Time Cycle, where you say that once in lieu of an honorarium of George White, a bibliophile...

09:24.280 --> 09:25.561
Yeah, Bernard.

09:25.582 --> 09:28.725
Probably the first old book I had.

09:28.745 --> 09:32.830
Yeah, that's what he gave me.

09:32.850 --> 09:39.758
The Edition of Bernard's Theory of the Earth, 1680s, 1690s.

09:39.778 --> 09:43.683
Yeah, the one I wrote about in Time's Arrow.

09:43.703 --> 09:46.646
Now, that book was about three texts, right?

09:48.008 --> 09:50.410
That book was about texts, Time's Arrow, your book.

09:50.931 --> 09:51.692
Yeah, right.

09:52.052 --> 09:52.973
I'm sorry, you're right.

09:52.993 --> 09:53.494
Three texts.

09:57.035 --> 10:00.739
and Hutton.

10:00.899 --> 10:04.823
And obviously you had to have... Pardon me, I'm groping here.

10:05.124 --> 10:07.106
I really want to talk to you.

10:07.126 --> 10:20.920
I guess the entry point is I'm just fascinated by the fact that you... There are so many different scholars who go to microfiche or... Oh, I have to.

10:20.961 --> 10:21.501
I have to.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.024
I can't own everything.

10:24.304 --> 10:25.185
But I do have a...

10:25.672 --> 10:29.738
I do have a principle, which I'll follow if I can.

10:29.798 --> 10:36.888
Whenever I write about something, I'll read the original source in the original language as long as I can do it.

10:37.990 --> 10:45.341
I can read most European languages I need to in my field, but I'll always try and get the original.

10:45.982 --> 10:49.287
And, you know, the Harvard Library, you don't usually have to work on a microfiche.

10:49.307 --> 10:52.371
The Harvard Library usually has the original.

10:52.958 --> 10:55.642
own a lot of them now in my own little area.

10:57.045 --> 10:58.748
I can often go to my own library.

11:01.953 --> 11:05.979
Pardon me for jumping around a little bit, but you had a couple of quotes in there.

11:06.420 --> 11:07.402
Passion for collecting.

11:07.462 --> 11:09.906
You say it's a full-time job, a blessed obsession.

11:10.988 --> 11:13.171
That's why I don't have it, because I'm a writer.

11:13.191 --> 11:19.101
Because you're a writer, and you don't have the time to throw yourself

11:19.334 --> 11:21.937
So you really are not obsessed by .

11:21.957 --> 11:22.357
.

11:22.377 --> 11:22.657
.

11:23.879 --> 11:28.523
I love having them, but the minute it takes time from writing, then something's wrong.

11:28.543 --> 11:29.664
But you don't go pursuing them?

11:29.704 --> 11:30.745
You don't go out and .

11:30.765 --> 11:30.846
.

11:30.866 --> 11:32.727
.

11:32.747 --> 11:35.991
you don't go to the fairs and get on your hands and knees and get .

11:36.011 --> 11:36.111
.

11:36.131 --> 11:36.311
.

11:36.371 --> 11:37.592
No, but I'll go to the end.

11:37.692 --> 11:39.915
I mean, you don't write 24 hours a day.

11:40.755 --> 11:44.559
If I'm in Boston and the antiquarian book fair comes to town, of course I'll go.

11:44.579 --> 11:49.324
Is there anything on your want list that you'd love to find if it kind of came here?

11:51.532 --> 11:55.316
Most of what I'd really like to have is too expensive at this point.

11:55.736 --> 11:57.318
Well, for instance?

12:01.062 --> 12:03.545
I'd like to have more than anything else.

12:05.327 --> 12:20.863
Oh, some of the really early stuff, like Bellon and Rondelet, or Linnaeus's Hortus Clefortianus with Rondelet's wonderful drawings.

12:21.704 --> 12:26.010
Pardon me.

12:26.070 --> 12:34.221
If I go into these zones, it's been a long day.

12:41.131 --> 12:49.703
So you really don't go out and, you don't go out searching for

12:51.286 --> 12:54.069
No, but, you know, I'm in touch with them.

12:54.129 --> 12:55.671
I get catalogs.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.855
That talk you gave at the Grolier Club, for instance.

13:00.537 --> 13:03.320
What was the general rubric of that particular?

13:03.340 --> 13:18.458
I just took a—I hope they were reasonably well integrated, but I just chose a set of examples of how, using my own books, I was able to construct essays and learn things.

13:18.623 --> 13:26.051
And that's the kind of thing that just now when I came in, you were obviously writing something, something that... It doesn't involve any of this stuff.

13:26.111 --> 13:29.835
It's a big technical book I'm doing now on the structure of evolutionary theory.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.518
Now, when I called you today, were you here?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.440
Yeah.

13:34.741 --> 13:37.784
See, I was under the mistaken impression that I was coming to your home.

13:38.104 --> 13:39.306
This is my home.

13:39.326 --> 13:39.786
You live here?

13:40.007 --> 13:41.128
Yeah.

13:41.148 --> 13:41.448
Really?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.871
I said I'll show you the whole thing for you.

13:45.693 --> 13:46.774
So tell me a little bit about

13:47.125 --> 13:49.368
Being down here in Soho.

13:49.388 --> 13:50.129
Soho is great.

13:50.389 --> 13:51.271
Well, I'm a New Yorker.

13:51.611 --> 13:52.552
I grew up.

13:52.572 --> 13:53.053
I love it.

13:53.173 --> 13:55.617
I grew up in Queens, so I've always been.

13:55.957 --> 14:00.964
Look, I lived in Boston for 30 years, and I always remained a Yankee fan.

14:01.485 --> 14:02.446
Isn't that a sign?

14:02.466 --> 14:05.310
I've always identified myself as a New Yorker in the S.A.

14:05.330 --> 14:08.394
You don't have to play with baseball, which is amazing.

14:09.055 --> 14:11.138
He didn't sign anyway.

14:11.538 --> 14:14.643
My best friend, I caught that DiMaggio ball sitting next to my father.

14:14.823 --> 14:15.023
He did.

14:15.340 --> 14:19.105
My friend had caught a Williams ball and mailed it to him, and he never got it back.

14:19.686 --> 14:34.305
I was with my uncle once, and a Ted Williams ball, he had, and a little kid, and I was with him, and a little kid was badgering him, and he gave, I was 15 years old, he gave this kid a Ted Williams ball.

14:34.545 --> 14:39.071
It was during batting practice, it wasn't a, I was, I mean, what about me?

14:39.932 --> 14:43.997
That was the closest I ever came to a Ted Williams ball, but he

14:44.315 --> 14:45.417
You could see his eyes.

14:45.537 --> 14:46.678
He hit it and he watched.

14:47.519 --> 14:48.080
He was great.

14:48.581 --> 14:51.966
And he watched where that thing landed, you know, in batting practice.

14:52.486 --> 14:58.214
And you also have some old baseball books up there.

14:58.314 --> 15:03.822
I hope you don't think this is a waste of your time.

15:03.922 --> 15:09.990
I really am very, very interested in talking to authors who somehow feel a communion with texts.

15:10.411 --> 15:11.132
Oh, yeah, I do.

15:11.568 --> 15:13.811
And it's not just as a collector.

15:13.951 --> 15:17.595
I'm trying to get beyond this whole thing of collecting.

15:17.616 --> 15:22.982
But are there any sacred texts that I use the word?

15:23.082 --> 15:24.344
Oh, yes, of course.

15:24.404 --> 15:36.799
I mean, no, I think that's a very well-chosen word, because if you have this viewpoint that authenticity... Because, look, I mean, the microfiche of the facsimile has all the content.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.862
So it's not that.

15:38.922 --> 15:39.803
It is something.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.043
I don't want to use the word mysterious.

15:42.063 --> 15:44.750
It's not mysterious, but it is something deeply psychological.

15:45.191 --> 15:48.358
It's something about authenticity that stirs the soul.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.529
And to that extent, if you accept it, then of course there are sacred texts.

15:52.669 --> 15:55.075
I have several of them here.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.866
Darwin's Origin of Species is a sacred text.

16:00.006 --> 16:03.031
I don't have a first edition of The Origin.

16:03.251 --> 16:04.212
It's not a rare book.

16:04.232 --> 16:06.175
You can buy one any time you have $20,000.

16:06.456 --> 16:07.537
But who wants it?

16:07.617 --> 16:09.961
They don't have an expensive one.

16:09.981 --> 16:12.144
Yeah, I mean, I don't need it.

16:12.204 --> 16:16.731
I have the second edition, which has the same binding characteristics.

16:16.751 --> 16:25.264
But I do have a first edition of Cuvier's On Small Fossil, the founding document of paleontology, because that's purchasable and reputable.

16:25.750 --> 16:35.625
I happen to own Cuvier's personal copy of the debate, the famous 1830 debate he had with Jeff Croix.

16:36.078 --> 16:59.537
at the Academy des Sciences in Paris, the famous debate that gave rise to the anecdotes late in Goethe's life, that when someone came to visit him in 1830 and Goethe was enthusing about the events in Paris, his friend just assumed that he was talking about the 1830 revolution, which was then occurring, and Goethe said, oh, no, no, you don't understand.

16:59.617 --> 17:01.039
I'm not talking about that.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.642
That's transient.

17:02.892 --> 17:12.524
I'm talking about the great debate between Cubier and Geoffroy, which is basically a debate about functional versus structural approaches to anatomy.

17:13.104 --> 17:21.034
And Geoffroy published the text of that and gave a copy to Cubier, which he never read.

17:21.074 --> 17:21.835
He just stamped it.

17:22.215 --> 17:22.996
But I've got that.

17:23.016 --> 17:26.841
Now, if that's a sacred text, I don't know what is.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.968
Oh, yeah, I have lots of sacred texts.

17:28.988 --> 17:29.889
Do you feel anything?

17:29.969 --> 17:32.653
I mean, a transference?

17:32.934 --> 17:36.639
I mean, Geoffroy must have handed that copy to Kimye.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.782
I don't know that they talked that much.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.929
They certainly weren't friendly, but they were colleagues.

17:43.890 --> 17:49.038
You can imagine that this object actually passed from Geoffroy's hand to Kimye.

17:49.058 --> 17:52.002
To help me along, how would you spell those two names so I don't have

18:05.498 --> 18:08.643
Is this an antique rail or something?

18:08.703 --> 18:10.265
No, it's not.

18:10.285 --> 18:10.786
We built it.

18:12.368 --> 18:12.909
That's great.

18:12.929 --> 18:13.870
And what kind of wood is this?

18:13.930 --> 18:14.631
Rosewood, maybe?

18:15.152 --> 18:15.933
Cherry.

18:15.953 --> 18:16.835
Cherry.

18:16.855 --> 18:17.295
Beautiful.

18:22.443 --> 18:22.803
Thanks.

18:24.826 --> 18:25.287
Oh, good.

18:25.307 --> 18:26.088
Excellent.

18:26.108 --> 18:30.274
Lots of sacred texts, and that's very relevant.

18:30.294 --> 18:34.881
I have one letter I own from Charles Darwin, which is

18:35.587 --> 18:37.969
present for my wife, and we're getting together.

18:38.009 --> 18:41.092
I didn't realize when she didn't either.

18:41.132 --> 18:50.681
It turns out to be a rather important unpublished letter that he wrote to Adam Sedgwick, his first teacher of geology, the last letter he ever wrote to him.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.925
That's a sacred object, surely.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.968
And I wrote an article about it.

18:57.988 --> 19:00.030
It turned out to be a historical discovery.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.072
It was just a piece of luck.

19:02.092 --> 19:04.294
No idea the bookseller who sold it

19:06.940 --> 19:08.222
No idea, but it's important.

19:08.242 --> 19:11.406
There's a Darwin letter, and he probably checked the auction records of Darwin.

19:11.886 --> 19:13.228
Well, this is a new one.

19:14.229 --> 19:16.672
And slapped a price on it without any idea of context.

19:16.692 --> 19:17.353
Yeah, he underpriced it.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.396
He wasn't a scientific dealer.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.777
He was a history dealer.

19:21.338 --> 19:23.461
Otherwise, he'd have figured it out.

19:23.521 --> 19:29.168
A couple years ago, when I was on the board of the Friends of the Goddard Library, Clark,

19:30.717 --> 19:35.025
It was right before this Nicholson Banker piece in the New Yorker.

19:35.045 --> 19:35.586
Oh, yeah.

19:35.606 --> 19:37.049
I remember they asked you if you'd sign.

19:37.069 --> 19:39.513
And you wrote back, and you signed something.

19:39.533 --> 19:50.895
It was very graciously, but you felt that it was a bad idea to deaccession these card catalogs, that you weren't overly enthusiastic about.

19:51.215 --> 19:51.696
They were not.

19:51.794 --> 19:55.178
I mean, I do sign a couple cards for the card catalog.

19:55.198 --> 20:01.124
Well, they were closing down the card catalog, and you said, I really am opposed to this.

20:01.164 --> 20:02.746
These are palpable things.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.629
The word you used was palpable as a matter of fact.

20:05.729 --> 20:07.011
Yeah, they are.

20:07.031 --> 20:07.491
I understand.

20:07.511 --> 20:10.334
I mean, I'm not against electronic.

20:11.356 --> 20:12.477
But how do you feel about this?

20:12.537 --> 20:19.945
I mean, do you, especially in the areas of science and, I don't know, paleontology or other

20:21.292 --> 20:30.541
This virtual revolution, if it's a revolution, I mean, this is coming, especially in the scientific area.

20:30.561 --> 20:33.064
Yeah, but I don't think books will disappear.

20:33.104 --> 20:46.877
There are aspects of virtuality that are very good for some in my world of museums to have online the world's holdings.

20:47.026 --> 20:55.538
And as graphics improve, I suppose at some point you'll even have holographic images of fossils visualized in three-dimensionally.

20:55.578 --> 21:03.149
The Smithsonian is doing a project of putting every Civil War monument.

21:03.209 --> 21:07.896
I've been trying not to replicate that interview, but there is, by the way, very useful material.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.540
I'm not trying to go over the same stuff.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.683
I don't want to waste your time.

21:12.743 --> 21:15.447
The virtual world is important.

21:16.979 --> 21:23.369
Well, I was just going through this new Arbonne CD-ROM.

21:24.070 --> 21:28.598
And I guess the one good thing it does is you can hear the chirp of every bird.

21:28.618 --> 21:29.599
That's about it.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.863
And they give you five views and you can hear the chirp.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.188
I'm going to get into this probably.

21:35.289 --> 21:37.292
I might even write about them.

21:37.372 --> 21:43.662
I'm going out to Corvus next month, which is that unit of Microsoft, Bill Gates' unit.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.916
And I did an interview today.

21:45.936 --> 21:46.557
Oh, that's good in there.

21:46.577 --> 21:50.905
I think, like, you want the OED online, because that's updated daily.

21:50.945 --> 21:51.626
See, that's great.

21:51.807 --> 21:54.091
Hard copy doesn't really do a lot for you.

21:54.111 --> 21:55.293
But I don't want Britannica.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.655
I mean, Britannica should be online.

21:56.695 --> 22:03.468
That's not how I want to use it, because I want to hold the, I mean, there's no thrill or anything in Britannica.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.652
I want to pull down a couple of volumes.

22:05.912 --> 22:07.655
I want to bring them over to my typewriter.

22:07.695 --> 22:08.637
I can't do that.

22:09.022 --> 22:11.485
I mean, how can you be a researcher in the virtual world?

22:11.505 --> 22:19.433
You look up one thing at a time at your terminal, and you can't sit surrounded by 20 different things, unless you have 20 different screens.

22:19.493 --> 22:21.575
I suppose that's not generally what you do.

22:22.897 --> 22:29.704
You have to bring things up sequentially, which is not the way to really do scholarship.

22:30.345 --> 22:32.467
Scholarship, you have to have things simultaneously.

22:32.647 --> 22:35.270
All right, you can bring up sequentially, print them out, use them later on.

22:35.791 --> 22:37.172
There are ways, but, you know.

22:37.625 --> 22:40.028
It's more than ambiance, is what you're saying.

22:40.048 --> 22:41.190
Oh, yeah, sure.

22:41.891 --> 22:43.653
It's just the way that research is done.

22:44.073 --> 22:45.095
Also, you never get it.

22:45.115 --> 22:46.997
I'll just give you my favorite example.

22:47.017 --> 22:47.117
Okay.

22:47.137 --> 22:55.368
And the things you just never get, you can get generic things electronically, but you'll never get this.

22:55.989 --> 23:00.094
I mean, this book will be, someday this book will be online.

23:00.195 --> 23:00.595
I may have shown

23:03.730 --> 23:08.178
1551, the first major work on mammals.

23:08.499 --> 23:10.763
It has dures, rhinoceros.

23:10.783 --> 23:12.906
Oh, God, look at this.

23:12.927 --> 23:16.152
Look at the paper, too, for 1551.

23:16.172 --> 23:18.036
This is in remarkable shape.

23:18.717 --> 23:19.558
Very little fox.

23:19.578 --> 23:20.420
Now, has this been treated?

23:20.921 --> 23:22.484
No, I don't think so.

23:22.504 --> 23:23.886
A little bit of foxing there.

23:24.006 --> 23:24.928
Yeah, some pages.

23:26.512 --> 23:27.794
40 years.

23:27.814 --> 23:29.476
That's Dura?

23:29.997 --> 23:31.279
Yeah, that's the famous picture.

23:31.599 --> 23:35.725
This picture is from Alvarez Dura, the most famous car.

23:37.087 --> 23:39.630
Copyrights, he just took it.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.977
But the point is, this book may go online someday.

23:44.537 --> 23:45.739
You think so?

23:45.759 --> 23:47.461
Nobody's ever going to translate it.

23:47.481 --> 23:48.643
Maybe, but suppose it does.

23:49.324 --> 23:52.529
It costs four bucks a page, but to digitize a book, you know.

23:52.549 --> 23:54.291
But even if it does...

23:55.233 --> 23:57.299
you'll never get what you have in this copy.

23:57.800 --> 24:02.071
Gessner was a cousin of Zwingli, the Protestant reformer.

24:02.432 --> 24:09.231
This copy was owned by a Catholic who, and the book was not on the index, but it was written by a dangerous Protestant.

24:09.532 --> 24:10.474
And what he did...

24:11.450 --> 24:26.472
who ever owned this is astonishing i mean it must have taken hundreds of hours clearly he didn't destroy the book because there's too much information in here but he blotted out the name of the author and of anybody who was suspect see the ink is faded but what he did here was to

24:26.452 --> 24:28.194
He just changed carefully.

24:28.254 --> 24:29.716
He didn't just ink it out.

24:29.736 --> 24:30.878
I guess he loved it too much.

24:31.098 --> 24:32.620
Somebody later put the name back in.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.441
But see what he did?

24:33.461 --> 24:36.705
He changed the... So you couldn't read the name.

24:36.865 --> 24:37.205
But why?

24:37.366 --> 24:39.348
And he did this on every page.

24:39.408 --> 24:40.089
Look at this.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.911
But did you try to figure that out?

24:41.931 --> 24:42.272
Oh, yeah.

24:42.312 --> 24:43.854
I mean, I know what name... Yeah, sure.

24:43.874 --> 24:45.195
But why did he... No, I mean the why.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.116
Why would he have done that?

24:46.197 --> 24:50.222
Because you didn't want the name of some heretics in a book you were going to use.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.064
Because he goes through everywhere.

24:52.084 --> 24:53.826
There's...

24:54.211 --> 25:01.584
He goes through every page, and every time there's a name, referator referred to by, but he blots out the name.

25:01.604 --> 25:02.686
But he doesn't blot it out.

25:03.187 --> 25:04.470
He blots it out carefully.

25:04.810 --> 25:06.293
Which names?

25:06.513 --> 25:07.595
You can look.

25:08.016 --> 25:09.739
There's a whole index.

25:09.955 --> 25:14.640
any Protestant, the name of anyone considered heretical.

25:15.020 --> 25:17.623
Carefully, carefully, page by page.

25:17.703 --> 25:21.367
Now, is he doing this to avoid damnation or to avoid getting in trouble, do you think?

25:21.387 --> 25:23.109
No, I think to avoid this.

25:23.149 --> 25:24.550
Hebrews are okay.

25:25.811 --> 25:26.492
Chapter 34.

25:27.213 --> 25:28.354
But he did it neatly, didn't he?

25:28.514 --> 25:29.395
That's the point.

25:30.016 --> 25:30.556
Look at that.

25:32.018 --> 25:35.021
And yet, you can't read the name through that.

25:35.822 --> 25:36.823
Now, have you written about this?

25:37.183 --> 25:37.824
Well, someday.

25:38.384 --> 25:39.085
And then you...

25:39.520 --> 25:41.141
You see what he's written here.

25:41.302 --> 25:51.290
He says, This dangerous and anathematized book, De Historia Animalium Quadrant.

25:51.310 --> 25:55.634
Can you translate it for me?

25:55.694 --> 25:59.637
This dangerous book, this dangerous and anathematized book.

25:59.717 --> 26:00.718
And he gives the title.

26:01.378 --> 26:02.199
I've never figured out.

26:02.620 --> 26:09.105
It's as dictated by the Holy Roman Inquisitors.

26:09.457 --> 26:10.278
some or other.

26:11.420 --> 26:14.746
It must be punta at obliterata.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.348
Something must be obliterated.

26:18.211 --> 26:19.293
What was the name of this owner?

26:19.313 --> 26:19.774
Did you know?

26:19.874 --> 26:21.316
No, I don't know.

26:21.517 --> 26:22.158
It's not here.

26:22.598 --> 26:26.344
And the date of the book?

26:26.364 --> 26:30.752
1551, but I don't know when it was done, but this is the early days.

26:31.934 --> 26:33.115
But isn't it wonderful?

26:33.396 --> 26:34.578
What's the short title of it?

26:35.259 --> 26:36.561
Historia Animalium.

26:40.169 --> 26:40.570
There it is.

26:42.012 --> 26:43.835
Okay, good.

26:43.855 --> 26:47.101
Historia and Emilia Libia.

26:48.063 --> 26:48.784
Oh, that's wonderful.

26:50.607 --> 26:52.711
So you'll never get that online.

26:53.372 --> 26:55.415
The most you'll never get is the generic book.

26:57.158 --> 26:58.821
Why don't you show me a few other favorites?

26:58.921 --> 27:05.653
I'm not going to occupy all of your time here.

27:07.523 --> 27:12.489
The last great Jesuit scholar, Athanasius Kierke.

27:12.509 --> 27:13.870
Wundus Subterraneus.

27:13.891 --> 27:16.053
1664.

27:16.073 --> 27:18.736
This is Athanasius Kierke.

27:18.756 --> 27:19.377
K-I-R-C-H-E-R-I.

27:19.557 --> 27:19.838
No.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.481
You've got to remember your gendered case.

27:23.722 --> 27:26.085
K-I-R-C-H-E-R.

27:28.768 --> 27:31.471
He was the greatest 17th century scholar.

27:31.511 --> 27:34.695
Nobody's ever heard of him now because he's the last of the Neoplatonists.

27:34.996 --> 27:41.926
I mean, he's a contemporary of Newton and Leibniz, but he holds to the old Neoplatonic view.

27:41.986 --> 27:43.408
His world got superseded.

27:43.448 --> 27:48.716
If you'd asked anyone in the 17th century who the greatest scholar in Europe was, you'd have probably heard nothing.

27:48.736 --> 27:49.457
Oh, look at that.

27:49.517 --> 27:50.318
That's wonderful.

27:50.358 --> 27:57.288
This is that manetna, typus montis etne, ab autore observanti, as observed by the author in 1637.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.250
In 1637.

27:59.391 --> 28:02.736
And this is published in Amsterdam, I think I noticed on the title.

28:02.877 --> 28:03.197
Oh, shit.

28:05.152 --> 28:05.573
1664.

28:06.394 --> 28:10.361
And have you written about this one?

28:11.342 --> 28:11.403
No.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.807
The interesting thing about this is these are two women.

28:14.408 --> 28:19.576
This is the, or, no, that's probably John.

28:19.636 --> 28:22.000
They are what, the printer and the engraver, you think, or?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.124
No, it was probably both the printers.

28:25.025 --> 28:26.308
I've seen books by.

28:26.929 --> 28:27.990
What was that map there?

28:28.010 --> 28:29.573
That was a very interesting map.

28:34.160 --> 28:52.114
We didn't know much about the southern unknown land.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.843
That's wonderful, isn't it?

28:59.050 --> 29:00.352
And where did you get these?

29:00.372 --> 29:02.114
Were these the things that you purchased?

29:02.134 --> 29:03.596
Yeah, I bought them when they were cheaper.

29:03.717 --> 29:05.279
I mean, I couldn't afford this today.

29:07.762 --> 29:08.864
These are all folios.

29:08.884 --> 29:18.217
Let's say 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, about 20 folios there.

29:18.237 --> 29:21.261
Isn't that Webster Lake?

29:21.511 --> 29:22.812
Lake Kukumajara.

29:22.892 --> 29:24.093
Isn't that Webster Lake?

29:24.113 --> 29:24.554
Oh, Lake.

29:24.574 --> 29:26.195
I don't know what it's called.

29:26.215 --> 29:27.296
That's in Massachusetts?

29:27.436 --> 29:29.398
It's also known as Webster Lake.

29:30.099 --> 29:30.579
Yeah, I know.

29:30.639 --> 29:31.480
Webster Mass.

29:32.721 --> 29:35.824
Every reporter out there, you have to learn how to... I never learned how to spell it.

29:35.844 --> 29:37.285
That's in the 50s on the first one.

29:37.325 --> 29:40.769
There's a Darwin letter.

29:40.789 --> 29:42.090
What do you think?

29:42.750 --> 29:47.034
He went to get a... He really had to sit there with his hand.

29:47.054 --> 29:50.117
He crossed down, because the post office had changed.

29:50.772 --> 30:09.032
And he really did not inscribe any books.

30:09.172 --> 30:10.353
Almost never.

30:10.373 --> 30:16.780
Anything with Darwin's deal on it is a really big deal.

30:17.637 --> 30:21.761
all sorts of letters, and they almost never used a manual.

30:21.781 --> 30:25.826
I mean, there's a fair amount of Darwin letters.

30:25.846 --> 30:29.350
I don't think his name is on more than a couple copies.

30:29.370 --> 30:32.493
Because even when he sent publishers' copies, he'd have someone else sign.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.475
That's right.

30:34.575 --> 30:37.178
Pascal Norman, who has the definitive collection.

30:37.638 --> 30:46.648
Even he has something that Darwin did to somebody down in... You just don't get an inscribed book by Darwin.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.485
His collection is really extraordinary.

30:49.846 --> 30:51.408
I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

30:51.668 --> 30:52.909
We had an earlier interview.

30:52.929 --> 30:57.875
We had a lot of good stuff in which I really said, and you did tell me you wanted to show me these things.

30:58.616 --> 31:00.198
That was really the purpose of this.

31:01.279 --> 31:05.804
I like to do things in situ, so to speak.

31:05.984 --> 31:09.548
I'll show you around the house.

31:13.628 --> 31:18.396
One of my favorites is this thing, which is .

31:18.416 --> 31:25.589
This is the early 18th-century equivalent of a Carl Sagan TV special, or David Alpera's series.

31:25.609 --> 31:26.611
What is it?

31:26.631 --> 31:30.418
It's the 750 plates of Schweitzer's Physikistakra.

31:31.319 --> 31:33.443
And how do we spell it, Schweitzer?

31:33.862 --> 31:35.424
It's like that.

31:35.805 --> 31:38.088
S-C-H-E-U-C-H-Z-E-R.

31:38.108 --> 31:42.215
That's Jean-Jacques, with a hyphen between Jean and Jean.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.979
Great Swiss savant of the early 18th century.

31:44.999 --> 31:54.533
But he decided to do a work in which every biblical event that had a natural history meaning would be discussed.

31:54.553 --> 31:57.077
So it's the Physica Sacre, the physics differential.

31:57.097 --> 31:58.118
And this is Amsterdam.

31:58.159 --> 31:59.981
What's that year when we knew most?

32:00.041 --> 32:02.485
1732.

32:03.106 --> 32:04.831
But what he did is he went through the whole Bible,

32:05.317 --> 32:12.727
And, uh, every time any event had any natural history meaning, he had 17, so he has the creation of insects, for example.

32:12.927 --> 32:13.948
Wonderful.

32:13.968 --> 32:15.931
50 of them.

32:15.971 --> 32:18.274
He had 17 engravers working on this full time.

32:18.294 --> 32:20.757
You see, it was, it was a popularization.

32:20.818 --> 32:23.741
It's, it's the Bible, science in the Bible.

32:23.982 --> 32:25.664
Was it a popular book in its time?

32:26.125 --> 32:26.285
Yeah.

32:26.325 --> 32:26.425
Yeah.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.968
I mean, for those who could afford it, but yeah, no, it was published.

32:29.028 --> 32:33.214
See, this is the French and the French edition, um,

32:33.869 --> 32:34.991
It was published in Dutch.

32:35.011 --> 32:36.153
It was published in Latin.

32:36.533 --> 32:41.582
See, the plates are in Latin and German, because they appeared in the same way.

32:41.602 --> 32:44.527
The Opus Quinti Die, The Work of the Fifth Day.

32:44.567 --> 32:54.162
But you see, what he did is he put the biblical story in the center, and then scientific knowledge around the border.

32:54.643 --> 32:57.548
So you have the embryology of insects around the border,

32:57.848 --> 33:01.575
And the creation of insects in the center.

33:01.595 --> 33:01.916
I love it.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.379
The spider's web just fans.

33:03.399 --> 33:04.100
That's wonderful.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.603
I mean, it's a wonderful place.

33:06.104 --> 33:06.705
Marvelous.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.929
Are these steel plates, you figure?

33:08.949 --> 33:09.470
What are they?

33:09.491 --> 33:10.593
They were done, I suppose.

33:10.633 --> 33:12.096
And then we get to know his ark, for example.

33:12.336 --> 33:12.897
It must be.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.520
Or copper.

33:14.540 --> 33:15.783
I mean, at least they were metal plates.

33:15.863 --> 33:16.644
Yeah, metal plates, yeah.

33:16.664 --> 33:17.005
Wood.

33:17.609 --> 33:19.552
So you get to Noah's Ark, for example.

33:19.592 --> 33:22.055
They're beautiful, aren't they?

33:22.075 --> 33:24.198
To worry about whether there's enough room, right?

33:24.478 --> 33:30.787
So he actually has here what appears to be almost an architectural reconstruction of Noah's Ark.

33:30.807 --> 33:33.070
How many species that are known?

33:33.150 --> 33:35.934
We must have some large pens there for the elephants.

33:39.058 --> 33:42.503
These are fossils, but for him they were relics of the flood.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.831
This is the Tower of Babel.

33:46.773 --> 33:47.474
That's wonderful.

33:47.975 --> 33:51.280
This is almost the kind of book that should be reissued in a way.

33:51.300 --> 33:56.047
Don't you think that somebody should actually... It's one of the great... Here's Jacob.

33:58.109 --> 34:02.295
This is the kind of thing that could benefit from a digitized... What do you get?

34:02.335 --> 34:04.238
Jacob in his wrestling with the angel, he's...

34:04.522 --> 34:06.124
They wrestle with the hip, right?

34:06.224 --> 34:10.450
And so you have the bones of the hip along the outside of the muscles.

34:10.470 --> 34:11.391
How long have you had this?

34:11.492 --> 34:13.715
Now this is a five-volume set, I can see.

34:13.735 --> 34:14.315
Ten years.

34:14.696 --> 34:17.540
Did you go through every plate when you got it?

34:19.903 --> 34:20.063
Yeah.

34:20.103 --> 34:20.724
Was that a kick?

34:23.308 --> 34:23.408
Sure.

34:23.428 --> 34:26.332
And you knew what it was prior to acquiring it?

34:26.712 --> 34:28.555
Unless you know what it is.

34:28.940 --> 34:32.404
Did you get that from a bookseller, or something that was offered?

34:32.764 --> 34:34.526
Well, there's other famous quotes.

34:34.546 --> 34:35.347
This is later.

34:35.427 --> 34:38.971
This is Heckel's Art Forms of Nature from 1904.

34:39.051 --> 34:41.494
H-A-E-C-K-E-L, Ernst.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.317
See, this is the great—he was a— Oh, look at that.

34:44.337 --> 34:46.119
These are hand-colored, I would say, huh?

34:46.139 --> 34:46.319
No.

34:46.620 --> 34:46.840
No?

34:46.940 --> 34:48.342
No.

34:48.362 --> 34:50.884
Well, what's the date?

34:50.924 --> 34:53.107
1904 is past the age of hand-colored.

34:55.329 --> 34:56.010
But, uh—

34:57.340 --> 34:59.763
These are still in print, the plates, 100 plates.

34:59.803 --> 35:06.812
This is the famous work in the movie about Oliver Sacks, Awakenings.

35:06.872 --> 35:15.122
This is the book he's looking at that Robin Williams is looking at when he gets a book from the frogs.

35:15.142 --> 35:18.306
In fact, that's going to be the cover of my next book, that one.

35:18.326 --> 35:21.590
That is the frogs.

35:21.631 --> 35:22.331
What is it?

35:22.392 --> 35:24.394
That means frogs.

35:25.893 --> 35:28.877
And is the next book going to be about frogs?

35:29.038 --> 35:32.683
No, it's just using trends.

35:32.763 --> 35:34.245
So you're using your stuff?

35:34.265 --> 35:35.828
No, I use them, yeah.

35:35.848 --> 35:36.489
That's great.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.370
I have them to use.

35:37.450 --> 35:40.174
British deer in their coins.

35:40.655 --> 35:44.160
This is Morton's Crania Americana in my book, The Mismeasure of Man.

35:44.180 --> 35:47.665
I did a whole analysis of the famous 1839.

35:48.067 --> 35:51.732
treatise on the skulls of people of all races.

35:52.534 --> 36:14.125
Crania, C-R-A-N-I, Americana, semicolon, on a comparative view of the skulls of various aboriginal nations of North and South America, to which, I love this, I love these titles, don't you, to which is prefixed an essay on the varieties of the human species by Samuel George Morton, M.D., Philadelphia,

36:14.459 --> 36:15.100
1839.

36:15.420 --> 36:15.520
Okay.

36:15.780 --> 36:28.634
Wonderful plates done by an American lithographer named John Collins, who has a little insert, I think, here, saying he's ready to do work for other people and would be happy to be consulted.

36:31.877 --> 36:34.300
So you like illustrated books, don't you?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.641
I mean, yes.

36:35.701 --> 36:36.522
I mean, who doesn't?

36:36.683 --> 36:41.928
But here's John Collins announcing that he's available to do other photographs.

36:41.948 --> 36:42.829
They can stand it.

36:43.214 --> 36:48.840
I mean, it's just that many of the great works in my field are illustrated books.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.883
It does come with the territory.

36:53.305 --> 36:57.069
This one's not illustrated, but it's as sacred a text as any, right?

36:58.350 --> 37:01.053
We're looking at the origin of species.

37:01.093 --> 37:05.918
I just got a fourth edition of Peeps's Diary for a hundred bucks, and I was thrilled to get it.

37:05.938 --> 37:09.442
It's not the first by any means, but for a hundred bucks.

37:09.742 --> 37:10.723
That's not bad, is it?

37:12.037 --> 37:19.368
on the Cape, beautiful leather-bounded Ralph Tickamsey.

37:20.210 --> 37:29.124
If you want to just show me a little bit, is there anything else that I think you think I should know about this?

37:31.247 --> 37:37.116
Don't forget, we did talk for an hour earlier, and that was a very good interview, and I saved a lot of the stuff.

37:37.737 --> 37:42.763
with the expectation that you said tell me some wonderful things about Umberto Eco.

37:42.923 --> 37:47.828
I'm going to see Eco at some point.

37:47.968 --> 37:49.250
Very useful stuff.

37:49.270 --> 37:55.016
I brought two books, which I would love for you to inscribe for me, and I'll just shut this up.

37:55.036 --> 37:59.361
I mean, of all my books, that's the one that's strictly based on textual analysis.

37:59.421 --> 38:04.627
A lot of my essays are, too, but none of my other full-scale books are textual in that sense.

38:04.647 --> 38:07.170
The Mismeasure of Man,

38:07.606 --> 38:08.587
wonderful life.

38:08.667 --> 38:10.509
They're about fossils and things.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.251
This one's really about text.

38:13.733 --> 38:16.476
And is this from anything in your collection?

38:16.897 --> 38:17.818
I showed you that one.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.420
That's the funnest piece to burn it.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.963
That's the one I was given as a gift.

38:22.804 --> 38:25.547
That's what you mentioned right in the beginning of this book?

38:25.567 --> 38:31.934
Yeah, I'll show it to you.

38:31.954 --> 38:32.154
Excellent.

38:32.174 --> 38:32.515
Excellent.

38:32.755 --> 38:34.017
I'm driving back tonight.

38:34.377 --> 38:35.138
Oh, yeah?

38:35.158 --> 38:35.318
Oh, boy.

38:43.853 --> 38:47.356
in the past was pretty effective.

38:47.697 --> 39:08.616
I was writing a piece actually on Protestant Catholic wars for natural history just a while ago, and it, what was I going to say, I was reading about the 13th century attempt to wipe out the Albigensian so-called heresy.

39:08.636 --> 39:12.460
They were just communal peoples of southern France, but they were

39:12.693 --> 39:19.945
anti-wealth and anti-church hierarchy and things.

39:20.065 --> 39:37.574
And they were so destroyed that this, even though most of the literature says it's very hard, and the Psychophia Britannica has this very telling line, it's very hard to really know anything about the Albigensians and what they believed, because almost all surviving texts were written by their enemies.

39:37.614 --> 39:38.616
They were a major...

39:39.001 --> 39:41.485
A major group of... The Albigensians.

39:41.505 --> 39:47.433
The Albigensians of southern France, they were wiped out, and all their documents were wiped out.

39:47.554 --> 39:48.936
And they wiped out their documents.

39:48.996 --> 39:51.199
Yeah, the people and the documents were wiped out.

39:51.219 --> 39:53.602
So all you have are the descriptions of the Inquisitors.

39:55.305 --> 39:56.827
Can you think of any other instances?

39:56.867 --> 40:02.295
I think a lot of these so-called heretical movements were done in Christianity.

40:02.315 --> 40:06.461
But they invariably destroy the documents, too, don't they?

40:06.481 --> 40:06.702
Yeah, sure.

40:06.722 --> 40:06.882
Amazing.

40:07.486 --> 40:18.098
Okay, I'm going to, if you'd kindly show me... Again, this is the one that George White gave me, but this... There it is, you did show that, I'm sorry.

40:20.181 --> 40:22.023
That's, yep.

40:22.043 --> 40:25.968
What Newton really worked on in physics was what he did in his youth.

40:25.988 --> 40:31.174
What he was really interested in was biblical criticism and alchemy and things like that.

40:31.834 --> 40:36.700
This is Newton's... This is Newton's famous chronology, his last book in which he tried to...

40:36.933 --> 40:43.283
bring all the ancient chronologies together in conformity with the Bible.

40:43.984 --> 40:50.153
What I'd be happy to do, by the way, if you'd like, I like doing it.

40:50.954 --> 40:51.495
Start again.

40:51.836 --> 40:53.498
No, come on.

40:53.518 --> 40:53.799
Okay.

40:55.541 --> 40:56.342
Function in French.

40:57.063 --> 40:58.105
I'm sorry.

40:58.225 --> 40:59.167
Okay.

41:00.008 --> 41:02.552
I apologize.

41:02.952 --> 41:04.695
Steel frame buildings.

41:05.519 --> 41:07.403
Were these columns here?

41:07.723 --> 41:10.829
Yeah, the columns are here because they're structural.

41:10.849 --> 41:12.152
So you'd have one row.

41:12.172 --> 41:26.700
But as you go out and look at it, I think it's remarkable to think that all these Victorian industrialists, these very practically minded men, they still had enough of an aesthetic sense that they put all these decorative cast iron fronts

41:27.355 --> 41:30.638
which mimic all the forms of architecture.

41:30.659 --> 41:33.482
You see all the dark columns on that one across the way.

41:34.302 --> 41:38.927
When they say a shaftway, is that... The shaftway is the elevator space.

41:38.947 --> 41:41.991
But they didn't have elevators, but they built the building.

41:42.011 --> 41:42.251
They did?

41:42.591 --> 41:44.373
On the 18th century?

41:44.393 --> 41:45.434
I think they did.

41:45.454 --> 41:48.137
I think that's the beginning of the elevator.

41:49.519 --> 41:51.861
They may have been the old pulley types.

41:52.820 --> 41:55.727
I almost thought this was a gallery when I came in.

41:55.747 --> 42:05.569
So, no, but these were gallery spaces, but, so what we did is we kept the front part of it fairly open, the tin ceilings original.

42:05.749 --> 42:09.057
This is a doll factory originally, and then it was,

42:09.340 --> 42:12.624
owned by an artist who didn't... The whole building or just the floor?

42:12.644 --> 42:13.365
No, just this floor.

42:13.405 --> 42:14.046
Yeah, each floor.

42:14.086 --> 42:18.251
There's still a couple of businesses on this street.

42:18.832 --> 42:23.678
And next door there are two Orthodox Jewish Brothers who are on a wall and remnants business, for example.

42:24.278 --> 42:25.240
So we kept the front part.

42:25.260 --> 42:26.521
That was my wife's artwork.

42:28.323 --> 42:32.268
So the office in there is also works with them in the living space.

42:32.288 --> 42:34.051
So do you use it as a gallery then?

42:34.071 --> 42:38.416
No, no, she has a studio.

42:38.436 --> 42:39.297
It's nearby.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.662
So this is basically this.

42:41.682 --> 42:42.623
This is wonderful.

42:42.844 --> 42:45.026
And then the living space is more back here.

42:45.046 --> 42:47.670
I think Ron has a different work style.

42:47.690 --> 42:52.776
I mean, in the midst of things, I need to be closed off like this.

42:52.796 --> 42:54.479
So it's more work space.

42:54.679 --> 42:58.624
And you put in all the wooden, I imagine, that's wonderful.

42:58.644 --> 42:59.946
That's great.

43:00.627 --> 43:03.310
And then for the pièce de résistance, really.

43:08.774 --> 43:12.960
with the limestone full of fossil shells.

43:14.502 --> 43:16.064
Look at that.

43:16.104 --> 43:20.710
That rock is the same rock that was used for the facing stone of Lincoln Cathedral.

43:20.990 --> 43:21.291
Really?

43:21.451 --> 43:24.034
So you can still, it's the very same quarry.

43:24.495 --> 43:25.817
It's full of fossil shells.

43:25.857 --> 43:26.538
Where is that quarry?

43:26.558 --> 43:29.402
It's a Jurassic limestone in England.

43:29.422 --> 43:29.802
Wow.

43:31.364 --> 43:32.045
Congratulations.

43:32.105 --> 43:33.347
This one is wonderful.

43:34.629 --> 43:35.710
I'm going to

43:36.280 --> 43:37.121
Take my leave.

43:38.082 --> 43:40.804
Thank you very much for spreading it.

43:40.844 --> 43:41.785
May as well take my bow.

43:43.427 --> 43:43.987
My tie.

43:44.007 --> 43:47.611
That's your belt.

43:48.151 --> 43:49.072
That's whatever that is.

43:49.993 --> 43:52.195
Didn't feel like that tie should be that heavy.

43:52.215 --> 43:53.316
Remember Pat the Bunny?

43:53.336 --> 43:55.278
Do you ever read Pat the Bunny?

43:57.320 --> 44:01.624
Children's book from the 1940s, the original interactive children's book.

44:01.704 --> 44:03.566
Do what it says.

44:03.586 --> 44:04.347
Do what it says.

44:05.795 --> 44:08.520
You'll say it's like me.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.982
You'll do it.

44:10.864 --> 44:11.365
Touch it?

44:11.385 --> 44:11.685
Yeah.

44:12.787 --> 44:14.811
The original doesn't do that.

44:15.532 --> 44:19.118
How do you get the kids out of here so I can finish shaving?

44:19.139 --> 44:28.495
My wife, Rhonda's doing a major sort of art show that's full of... I says, please do touch the artwork.
