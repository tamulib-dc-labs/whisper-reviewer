WEBVTT

00:04.604 --> 00:18.320
Because the light was in my eye as I was talking to you.

00:18.721 --> 00:30.895
Do you remember where we were?

00:30.915 --> 00:32.737
Oh, she is, isn't she?

00:32.757 --> 00:33.598
Wonderful.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.806
She had the state of the arts.

00:36.826 --> 00:38.508
She did a book about the Virgin Mary, I think.

00:38.588 --> 00:39.249
Brilliant.

00:39.309 --> 00:40.310
Wasn't it brilliant?

00:40.330 --> 00:41.151
It's my kind of book.

00:41.251 --> 00:48.601
I love to follow characters, ideas, through, you know.

00:48.621 --> 00:49.542
It was a wonderful book.

00:49.562 --> 00:50.323
I've read all of her books.

00:50.343 --> 00:52.366
She did a novel that was quite nice, too.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.147
It was.

00:53.167 --> 00:53.687
It was good.

00:54.048 --> 00:55.350
It was kind of nice.

00:55.370 --> 00:55.510
Anyway.

00:55.530 --> 00:56.511
Something about the father.

00:56.631 --> 00:57.693
No, I think she's wonderful.

00:58.394 --> 00:59.335
I admire her very much.

01:00.196 --> 01:01.898
Anyway, her brother dropped her vest.

01:02.198 --> 01:11.687
There's a theme, there's a new biography of Forster, and I didn't realize this.

01:11.727 --> 01:28.041
Of course, everybody who has seen or read Howard's End knows that Bath died at the end of this avalanche of books, but he apparently used that theme of fallen books or manuscripts about five times, a manuscript falling into a ravine, not necessarily books out of a bookcase.

01:28.161 --> 01:29.843
I wonder what that was all about.

01:30.160 --> 01:35.908
What traumatic thing must have happened to him where he lost something in progress or some work?

01:36.569 --> 01:40.794
You know, it's like Hemingway's police being left at the train station by his wife.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.578
I mean, one wonders.

01:45.861 --> 01:55.594
Getting back to the concern of these other writers you say about this, about your first, you used the phrase, leaving your children.

01:56.195 --> 01:59.880
You are concerned, obviously, that this would be something that people would

02:00.299 --> 02:02.722
It's certainly the stuff of tabloid, isn't it?

02:02.742 --> 02:07.648
It's the kind of thing that people can misunderstand and misuse and misinterpret.

02:08.309 --> 02:09.650
Well, you know, they do away.

02:09.690 --> 02:17.620
The Daily Mail came out with a quote, supposedly from me, saying, I left my babies for the shores of love.

02:18.060 --> 02:19.402
Well, now the lawyers are onto it.

02:20.203 --> 02:22.125
But this kind of thing they invent.

02:23.347 --> 02:29.614
But you see, the thing is, I have a daughter, two granddaughters,

02:30.033 --> 02:36.140
a son and a son who died just before this book came out, but he helped me with it.

02:36.420 --> 02:45.550
Well, I wanted to get the record straight, you know, because I knew that when the barber could come out, God knows what they would be saying.

02:45.830 --> 02:51.577
You know, as much as for them as for me, I wanted to get this out.

02:51.597 --> 02:54.179
Well, you end this, you conclude this book, too.

02:54.199 --> 02:57.403
I mean, it's, the door had shut, and that was that.

02:57.883 --> 02:59.365
That's the final sentence of the book.

02:59.986 --> 03:04.090
Well, that's just ironical, because, of course, you do not shut the doors.

03:04.110 --> 03:04.771
No, you shut the doors.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.593
But, I mean, we're really getting on, probably.

03:08.235 --> 03:10.617
These were pretty eventful times, weren't they?

03:10.857 --> 03:11.578
You were a young woman.

03:11.598 --> 03:12.599
You were thirty years old.

03:12.719 --> 03:13.300
Yeah.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.044
And it was a pretty eventful life for the first thirty years, wasn't it?

03:17.064 --> 03:17.464
It really was.

03:17.484 --> 03:20.027
Well, it went on being eventful.

03:21.749 --> 03:23.290
That's a great line.

03:23.310 --> 03:29.537
I always come into these interviews wondering, not being satisfied until I know I've got my lead sentence.

03:30.007 --> 03:32.530
And also, I'd like to know how I'm going to conclude it, too.

03:32.610 --> 03:36.754
You see, I think you just gave me my concluding sentence.

03:37.235 --> 03:47.205
Of course, I haven't really asked you about the book, per se, because that speaks quite eloquently for yourself, but it seems forced to ask you to explain things that are in your book.

03:47.225 --> 03:51.970
And I'm just so pleased to be able to talk to you.

03:53.652 --> 03:56.875
I gather that there's nothing... It seems that...

03:57.327 --> 04:06.300
I think this woman who reviewed for the Boston Globe was kind of myth that, I mean, it doesn't seem that there's anything to be repentant about.

04:06.320 --> 04:15.833
I mean, you're quite content, I guess, with the life that you've lived, I guess is how I'm trying to crystallize, summarize this.

04:16.133 --> 04:19.538
Well, you see, I've never believed in

04:22.808 --> 04:24.970
Wishing things were different in the past.

04:25.010 --> 04:26.332
There's no value in it.

04:26.352 --> 04:27.393
I mean, what's the point of it?

04:29.655 --> 04:30.416
I've never done it.

04:30.936 --> 04:34.220
If you've done something, it might have been right or wrong, but you've done it.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.542
I mean, you live with the consequences.

04:36.562 --> 04:40.546
You don't sit around beating your breast and wailing about it.

04:40.606 --> 04:45.912
But you're content with the course that your life has taken.

04:45.932 --> 04:52.258
Content may not even be the correct word, but... What sort of choice were...

04:52.998 --> 04:54.080
are these choices.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.625
I think we have very limited choices actually.

04:57.685 --> 05:04.035
Is it possible that I was struck by something, it didn't occur to me when I was writing it.

05:04.435 --> 05:13.509
Various women journalists have said to me in London that they were impressed by the fact that I enjoyed being a young woman.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.774
I physically enjoyed being a young woman.

05:16.794 --> 05:20.119
Well, this seems to me very sad that

05:20.960 --> 05:22.702
It should be commented on in tour.

05:23.183 --> 05:35.298
And I have a theory, no more, that what has happened to young women is that they're being shouted at all the time, mostly by women's magazines and by doctors as usual.

05:36.219 --> 05:43.428
Either they're being told that they're too fat or the wrong shape or something, or their skin should be different, or they should not have died.

05:43.588 --> 05:43.969
I don't know.

05:44.529 --> 05:46.572
They're being yelled at day and night.

05:46.712 --> 05:48.975
And it's the women's magazines that do most of the yelling.

05:49.276 --> 05:54.529
Either that or they're being lectured about breast cancer or something.

05:54.589 --> 05:57.016
Well, we didn't have any of that.

05:57.998 --> 06:03.572
Of course now, with the baby boomers, the big thing is dealing with menopause.

06:04.278 --> 06:20.933
Yes, well, you see, I know women, we actually lower our voices when we say that we have no problems with the menopause, because we should look at our children in case somebody should overhear us, because it's always a duty to have a terrible time in the menopause.

06:22.434 --> 06:29.601
You know, having read, I have to confess, I read that woman's, because it was published a couple of weeks ago, I read her review before I read the book.

06:30.942 --> 06:33.424
To read this, this is the Boston Globe interview.

06:34.670 --> 06:39.455
to read that review on its own, you would think that this book is humorless.

06:40.015 --> 06:40.716
That's not funny.

06:40.896 --> 06:42.497
Maybe she's humorless.

06:42.658 --> 06:45.020
But there are very funny things in here.

06:45.200 --> 06:50.345
I mean, when you're talking about, pardon me, but you're talking, you talk about enjoying being a young woman.

06:50.365 --> 06:57.812
I have here, page 185, you spent adolescence in a sexual trance, a fever of erotic longing.

06:58.372 --> 07:02.196
And then you talk about, you know, how generations change, and you talk about

07:02.547 --> 07:11.915
various kinds of orgasms, you know, which weren't supposed to be pleasurable in your time, but apparently— Oh, yeah, we were allowed to have a pleasurable orgasm.

07:12.196 --> 07:24.887
What was wrong with all these books, it was that they had a curious kind of religious tint about them, you know, which doesn't have much to do as real sex.

07:25.728 --> 07:32.554
But I find this very, you know, entertaining.

07:33.175 --> 07:35.378
There's also a volume I can sell there.

07:35.398 --> 07:37.480
I try to read all the books.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.681
It's a pretty good book.

07:38.701 --> 07:43.667
It's a feminist companion to English literature.

07:43.687 --> 07:44.929
You're familiar with that book, Yale.

07:45.049 --> 07:48.953
I like to read, you know, just to receive.

07:48.973 --> 08:00.567
And they were very respectful to you, but they say that your exploration of inner space fiction, is that a phrase that's germane to any of the

08:00.901 --> 08:04.344
One of them, yes, that was Briefing for Defending the Hell.

08:05.325 --> 08:08.949
The interspace fiction is kind of nice.

08:11.451 --> 08:21.240
Do you expect that your work, the body of your work, and I don't have the numbers, but my God, how many volumes must it be?

08:21.380 --> 08:29.288
You can count it on the title page there, but do you expect it to be, do you see it as a porpoise of work, as an integral?

08:29.977 --> 08:33.661
Is everything an element of the body of work?

08:33.681 --> 08:34.842
Is everything part of it?

08:34.862 --> 08:36.764
It's all linked as far as I'm concerned.

08:36.784 --> 08:40.027
It's a kind of organic growth, really.

08:40.047 --> 08:41.008
One book to the next.

08:41.228 --> 08:49.336
And to understand Doris Lessing, one must really then attend to the body of work, I guess.

08:49.356 --> 08:52.359
Come on, I don't expect anything so much.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.242
There are people who read everything I write, but

08:55.947 --> 08:58.250
Some people just read bookings of them.

08:58.270 --> 09:03.496
I mean, there are people who can't bear fantastic differences if they don't read the cannabis book.

09:03.516 --> 09:10.826
But you are certainly justly regarded as a writer of serious fiction.

09:10.846 --> 09:23.862
It must give you some satisfaction to know that this stuff is going to be there in the 24th century and beyond, I'm sure, what hopes are being read.

09:24.938 --> 09:27.001
Does it speak for its time, do you think?

09:27.021 --> 09:27.641
I do think.

09:27.862 --> 09:33.328
I do think some of them are a record of its time, particularly the Golden Notebook.

09:33.348 --> 09:46.044
You know, when I wrote it, I thought, one of the reasons I wrote it was because I wished novels, certain novels had been written about from the 19th century that were never written.

09:47.946 --> 09:53.393
And I knew that the time that was just finishing, that we're now 56, 57, 58.

09:54.014 --> 10:00.541
I knew that something was finishing that had been quite extraordinary, and I wanted to get it down before it disappeared.

10:01.482 --> 10:04.886
And you were a young woman when you wrote that book.

10:04.906 --> 10:11.293
I mean, did you actually have this perception of when you were ending and another one... Yes, I did.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.054
I did indeed.

10:12.074 --> 10:13.436
It was very, very clear.

10:13.456 --> 10:14.317
It was palpable.

10:14.357 --> 10:18.481
I mean, you... No, because don't forget I'd been a communist.

10:18.502 --> 10:21.625
I wasn't when I wrote it, but the thing was,

10:24.102 --> 10:29.827
Soviet communism came to an end not in the last three years ago.

10:29.947 --> 10:37.614
It ended basically with Khrushchev's speech to the 20th Congress, which you've probably never heard of.

10:37.654 --> 10:40.796
But in the communist world, this was a great dramatic event.

10:42.057 --> 10:49.684
And as a result of this, I mean, a lot of communists broke their hearts.

10:50.204 --> 10:51.806
You know, very good people.

10:51.826 --> 10:53.367
We had a totally...

10:53.701 --> 10:58.230
rosey idea of life, actually, and communism.

10:58.931 --> 11:02.558
And I was observing a breakup of something.

11:02.638 --> 11:06.605
I was observing it was like a landslide.

11:07.647 --> 11:10.533
And I knew that was finished, that was all finished.

11:12.136 --> 11:17.025
Do you have any kind of a political hope, I mean, for an alternative?

11:17.849 --> 11:20.152
I mean, if that's finished, is there an answer then?

11:20.392 --> 11:25.518
God forbid that we should have any more utopian movements like communism.

11:25.538 --> 11:27.781
They're recipes for murder.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.425
Well, we've already got them.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.047
They happen to be religious.

11:33.067 --> 11:39.575
Well, the biggest joke, you know, is that me and my lot, we used to congratulate each other.

11:39.635 --> 11:45.882
We used to say, at least, we can never again have a nationalist war or a religious war.

11:46.587 --> 11:48.570
How about that for being wrong?

11:50.193 --> 11:51.615
Do you get angry when you write?

11:52.497 --> 11:59.348
Does anger, is there an edge of anger in there?

11:59.368 --> 12:03.956
Well... It's when I write.

12:04.837 --> 12:13.371
You know, even now, I can't... The predominant emotion for me in my life in the Second World War

12:13.942 --> 12:20.508
anger over the waste, because we knew it was the money that was being wasted, we could transform the world, and we humanity.

12:21.929 --> 12:23.270
This was the strongest emotion.

12:24.631 --> 12:37.923
I mean, when I think about it now, why is it we can go to war so efficiently, but we can't spend that money on improving the world?

12:39.724 --> 12:43.948
There was a thing on 60 Minutes last night, they showed this stone plane.

12:44.907 --> 12:47.051
It's a hundred million dollars each.

12:48.253 --> 12:50.456
It's just the most remarkable device.

12:51.197 --> 12:55.364
It can repel the radar and it can come in.

12:55.384 --> 12:57.388
It'll probably be obsolete in ten years.

12:57.408 --> 13:07.945
Whatever, but there's no qualm about spending that kind of money to develop this extraordinary fighting machine.

13:08.279 --> 13:10.141
We've got all our priorities wrong.

13:10.161 --> 13:10.682
I don't know.

13:10.702 --> 13:15.427
Well, I'm kind of running up on my hour, and I don't want to overextend myself.

13:15.447 --> 13:19.071
Oh, it's okay.

13:19.091 --> 13:22.575
And so how are you coming with the next volume of the memoir?

13:23.496 --> 13:35.670
Well, actually, what I've been doing in the last several months, I wrote a novel about four years ago, which didn't work, didn't gel.

13:36.157 --> 13:43.687
While this one was going through the machinery, I fixed that out and saw if I, anyway, it's been rewritten again.

13:43.727 --> 13:47.713
And now it works, so I sent that to a typist last week.

13:49.015 --> 13:51.879
If there were four vault twos, it'll probably be a novel.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.704
So you say typist, you still write in longhand, then I gather.

13:55.724 --> 14:05.758
No, I write in typewriter, but I, old-fashioned, but I'm a very bad typist because when I type for Hansard, you know, I type for Parliament.

14:06.194 --> 14:10.819
at this extreme speed that we needed, and it just ruined my typing.

14:10.839 --> 14:14.223
I can't type a sentence without a mistake.

14:14.883 --> 14:15.244
I can't.

14:15.704 --> 14:18.787
See, I love to—I type very quickly.

14:18.807 --> 14:19.809
Well, and well.

14:19.829 --> 14:21.490
And well, very well.

14:21.771 --> 14:22.752
You see, I can't.

14:22.772 --> 14:25.014
And I love word processes.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.556
I have—I dance.

14:26.996 --> 14:31.241
Well— You think I might not—probably that's the next thing I have to do.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.182
I don't think so.

14:32.302 --> 14:33.383
I think that for writing

14:33.886 --> 14:39.412
kind of writing which is probably more contemplative and requires a bit more.

14:39.432 --> 14:59.775
You see, when you go through, for, I don't know, a false time, there are still things that you'll notice, but simply the slowness of the typing and the rhythm of the, it's, um, I think I'm so used to it now that I couldn't change that.

15:01.544 --> 15:03.166
Do you ever throw things away?

15:03.467 --> 15:05.791
Oh, yes, all the time.

15:05.811 --> 15:06.291
Absolutely.

15:06.852 --> 15:19.952
So if something isn't working, I mean, you say early on, I think the year was 1937, and you say, I wrote two apprentice books, and you were very disappointed with what you had written, and apparently, I guess you threw them away.

15:20.112 --> 15:20.493
Yes, I did.

15:21.274 --> 15:28.986
But this is something worth noting, that you started to write, you wrote something, and you said, this is not good.

15:29.742 --> 15:30.903
So you know.

15:30.943 --> 15:34.187
I mean, you're your harshest critic then, I gather.

15:34.908 --> 15:40.815
Yes, I am, but sometimes you have to leave things to sit around a few months before you stay.

15:41.415 --> 15:42.156
And stand back.

15:43.217 --> 15:56.172
And going back to the five books of the future, it is interesting that you did use archives, the device of writing about it from recorded

15:56.422 --> 15:59.005
because I'm fascinated by archives and the things that we read.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.927
They are fascinating, aren't they?

16:00.947 --> 16:11.458
And that's what my book is about, the written records by which we know what's passed on from one generation to the next.

16:11.478 --> 16:23.751
I mean, you obviously have... Sometimes it comes to me, what a credit hub the novel is, the last four centuries, of information about people, about places.

16:24.773 --> 16:25.213
I mean,

16:25.750 --> 16:29.258
It's an extraordinary achievement, a novel, isn't it?

16:29.278 --> 16:29.399
It is.

16:29.419 --> 16:34.310
You mentioned this one fellow towards the end of the book who gave you a short list of essential books.

16:34.330 --> 16:34.410
Yes.

16:35.673 --> 16:38.761
Thankfully, he did start with Don Quixote, but it was always changing.

16:39.061 --> 16:40.926
Do you have a list of essential books?

16:40.946 --> 16:41.126
No.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.730
You've got Hamlet in there, too, which is...

16:49.747 --> 16:53.732
Well, I've gone off by newspapers.

16:53.832 --> 16:57.176
I mean, I always do, because of anything to encourage reading.

16:57.937 --> 17:00.079
I mean, I couldn't come up with ten books.

17:00.179 --> 17:07.248
I think it's the most astonishing edifice, this novel, which we take for cautious.

17:07.268 --> 17:07.708
It's amazing.

17:07.728 --> 17:09.290
It really is, isn't it?

17:09.310 --> 17:14.256
The novel, I mean, truth in fiction, I guess, is where that comes from.

17:14.276 --> 17:14.376
Yeah.

17:14.576 --> 17:18.741
I mean, do you know that there are whole countries that we know about truth.

17:19.413 --> 17:25.840
We know about pre-Revelies near Russia through the great Russian writers.

17:25.860 --> 17:30.625
We wouldn't know about them from anywhere else.

17:30.645 --> 17:35.890
Who among your contemporaries do you read, or is that an answer to your question?

17:37.752 --> 17:39.414
I never answer that one.

17:39.974 --> 17:40.735
Okay, fine.

17:40.755 --> 17:46.641
I guess I sensed it was nice to... I've got an awful lot of material.

17:46.661 --> 17:47.682
I don't want to...

17:49.028 --> 17:54.214
It's always called the native problem, isn't it, by some such phrase.

17:54.814 --> 18:00.841
In Ireland it's the problem, or the native problem, or whatever.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.783
The trouble system is what they use.

18:02.984 --> 18:17.820
Well, when I was growing up it was called the native problem, and white civilisation, a phrase which I always give me makes me laugh, and the colour bar, all these phrases have disappeared.

18:18.543 --> 18:19.244
It is interesting.

18:19.284 --> 18:26.010
We haven't even discussed it, but you use the Cole Porter lyric, obviously, for the title.

18:26.030 --> 18:31.595
You use it in one of the epigraphs, and then you use it again in the book itself.

18:31.615 --> 18:36.740
Tell me a little bit why you chose to use this particular song for the title.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.922
Well, you see that there are three epigraphs.

18:38.942 --> 18:39.883
There were three of them.

18:39.903 --> 18:40.844
I said one of the ones.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.906
Oh, but they're all on the same theme.

18:44.107 --> 18:47.470
The one about coercive agents, it says.

18:48.243 --> 18:55.350
While you have patterns of conditioning inside you, you can't act differently outside those patterns.

18:55.370 --> 19:13.207
And then there's, you have a very remarkable chap called Edward Hall, researching into rhythms of groups, and I can't understand why people haven't swooped on that rhythm, pride in amazement, because it says so much about society.

19:13.828 --> 19:16.410
And all these three

19:16.728 --> 19:21.233
quotes are all on the same subject, that is, that we're not as free as we think we are.

19:23.155 --> 19:33.488
And you also, you give us these little touchstones at the Times, you know, you mentioned the arrival of American, your exposure to American jazz and the talkies, the movies come in.

19:33.508 --> 19:33.588
Yes.

19:34.028 --> 19:36.751
But I have the sense that you like jazz music.

19:36.831 --> 19:38.173
I love jazz music.

19:38.193 --> 19:41.517
Very much, very much, yes.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.880
It's been about four years at Merston.

19:43.940 --> 19:45.081
God, what an experience.

19:46.512 --> 19:50.658
What music?

19:50.758 --> 19:51.339
I'm curious.

19:51.539 --> 19:55.164
It's quite a job, actually, getting permission to quote lyrics in a book, isn't it?

19:55.184 --> 19:56.646
Well, thank God they did it.

19:56.666 --> 19:57.407
I didn't.

19:57.468 --> 19:58.449
Their publishers did it.

19:58.709 --> 19:58.910
I know.

19:58.950 --> 20:08.283
I quote a guy, this African-American guy who put together a remarkable collection of African-American literature.

20:08.523 --> 20:10.466
I think it's Charles Bloxson.

20:10.486 --> 20:12.649
And he's a great athlete.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.370
And he gave up.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.114
He was actually offered a professional.

20:16.482 --> 20:23.129
football contract, and he walked away from it, so he wanted to become, at his words, a black bibliophile.

20:23.149 --> 20:29.175
This is a long introduction, but he was in New York one day, and he said, I took the A train to Harlem.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.499
You know, this guy, da-da-da-da-da-da, like that.

20:33.099 --> 20:41.528
And boy, the trouble, I don't like, I mean, how difficult it was to actually get to use, I said, to hell with it, pardon me, I will just paraphrase it.

20:41.888 --> 20:46.253
And I said, he hummed an off-bar thing from Duke Ellington's famous

20:46.773 --> 20:48.235
song with the same name.

20:48.456 --> 20:55.807
Because if you start quoting the lyric, it's amazing the difficulty you have to go through to actually quote a song.

20:55.827 --> 21:03.198
Well, you see, the thing was that they are part of the text of the book.

21:03.819 --> 21:04.600
They are.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.461
They're wonderful.

21:05.581 --> 21:06.883
But they fixed it.

21:06.923 --> 21:08.085
That was handled.

21:08.726 --> 21:13.433
It is fortunate that you have the same publisher in the UK that you have here.

21:13.453 --> 21:15.817
That helps, doesn't it?

21:15.837 --> 21:16.037
It is.

21:17.013 --> 21:18.895
So anyway, I was lucky about that.

21:19.977 --> 21:28.206
But the one that I've written, one I've just finished, has a lot of poetry quoted.

21:28.226 --> 21:30.349
Well, that's easier because everyone's dead.

21:30.910 --> 21:32.391
It's a part of the fabric of the book.

21:32.972 --> 21:36.516
I try to quote some poetry of a living person and forget it.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.283
I mean, I know exactly what you're saying.

21:42.303 --> 21:46.328
I think I've basically... Oh, I'd love to ask you about this thing.

21:47.759 --> 21:49.762
Jane Somerset.

21:51.664 --> 21:52.165
Yeah.

21:52.666 --> 21:58.594
Tell me a little bit about what prompted you to do that and your response to it.

21:58.674 --> 22:06.144
Is it a commentary on publishing today or were you really just trying to give a response to your writing?

22:06.505 --> 22:07.866
Well, a lot of different things.

22:09.168 --> 22:16.298
I really knew how the machinery of publishing works in England back to front and I had a pretty good idea what would happen.

22:16.649 --> 22:29.423
because the first book of that, the Diaries of Jane, I mean, sorry, the Diary of a Good Neighbour, is in fact just a little bit off the centre and easy to refuse.

22:29.964 --> 22:32.807
I did that for a purpose.

22:32.968 --> 22:43.159
And it was turned down by my two main publishers, and I discovered it later that the readers had read it, not the actual publishers.

22:43.179 --> 22:45.762
The readers' reports were extremely patronising,

22:46.400 --> 22:48.122
as they often are with young whites.

22:48.803 --> 22:55.934
But the third publisher, who was my first publisher, Michael Joseph, took it, saying that Hermione had a young Doris Lessing.

22:56.254 --> 22:58.738
So we said, for God's sake, we took it in the secret.

22:59.158 --> 22:59.899
Don't say that.

23:00.781 --> 23:07.370
So then what happened next was three European publishers took it, not knowing it was by me.

23:07.410 --> 23:09.373
Now that's what really cheered me up.

23:10.074 --> 23:15.021
And then my American publisher, a very clever Bob Gottlieb, recognized it.

23:15.522 --> 23:15.782
He did?

23:16.066 --> 23:18.590
and we said, hush.

23:18.610 --> 23:20.713
So... He published it in his mouth?

23:20.833 --> 23:25.219
Yes, I have a very different name under James Thomas.

23:25.239 --> 23:30.426
And it was sent to the experts on my work who didn't recognize it.

23:30.687 --> 23:40.360
But I have to say in their defense that we are all sent so many books that it's easy not to read books because, you know, they climb up your walls.

23:41.262 --> 23:45.027
But I wonder, did they indicate on the copy that

23:45.614 --> 23:47.517
This is the pseudonym of a... No.

23:47.537 --> 23:49.139
...the pen name of a family?

23:49.199 --> 23:50.481
Generally.

23:50.501 --> 23:50.681
Really?

23:50.721 --> 23:54.467
It was very terribly done, if I say so myself.

23:54.667 --> 23:58.553
I worked out a persona that was a literary one.

23:58.573 --> 24:00.135
She was a female journalist.

24:00.155 --> 24:05.042
I said, this is the pen name of a female journalist.

24:05.062 --> 24:11.411
So that meant all the female journalists reviewed it in this country.

24:11.832 --> 24:13.174
But an interesting thing happened.

24:13.614 --> 24:14.676
I was told that

24:15.382 --> 24:22.428
Somebody wrote to me and said that they'd written an extremely enthusiastic review for the New York Times.

24:22.448 --> 24:23.689
They thought it was wonderful.

24:24.190 --> 24:28.073
And the New York Times refused to publish it.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.755
So it could have had a good review in the New York Times.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.998
Was it the New York... What's the other one?

24:34.018 --> 24:34.619
The Review?

24:34.639 --> 24:35.019
Yes.

24:35.039 --> 24:36.160
The Review of Books?

24:37.862 --> 24:38.382
That's right.

24:38.402 --> 24:39.723
They run the long essays.

24:40.344 --> 24:41.965
The Review of Books is like a tabloid.

24:41.985 --> 24:42.346
Oh, no, no.

24:42.806 --> 24:43.887
It was the New York Times essay.

24:44.457 --> 24:51.124
And so it could have had a very good review in the New York Times, but they planned it down.

24:51.945 --> 25:00.493
And so what it actually got was kind of... revealed a promising newcomer, yes, that's what it got.

25:00.513 --> 25:02.896
And I found it all enormously entertaining.

25:03.616 --> 25:07.000
So now is this book... Well, now it's under my name.

25:07.020 --> 25:07.921
It's under your name.

25:07.941 --> 25:10.043
But it's still... it was published under...

25:10.495 --> 25:12.797
in three European countries on the game.

25:12.817 --> 25:13.718
I wasn't quite well.

25:13.738 --> 25:14.959
Then it was published on Imani.

25:15.419 --> 25:18.802
But were you satisfied with an experiment for you?

25:18.842 --> 25:20.404
What did you want to learn?

25:20.704 --> 25:22.405
Oh, I wanted to know.

25:22.445 --> 25:31.793
You know, because you feel sort of inside a great cloud of associations.

25:32.894 --> 25:36.878
What do you feel would be like to be out, to get out?

25:37.678 --> 25:39.540
And to be unknown and to have the work

25:39.942 --> 25:43.846
evaluated totally as a work from somebody nobody knows.

25:43.906 --> 25:46.348
So were you satisfied with the results that it got?

25:46.989 --> 25:52.515
Did it do basically pretty well, I mean, in terms of the critical response?

25:52.675 --> 25:55.698
Well, it got a few good reviews.

25:56.699 --> 26:00.022
You know, it was like a promising first.

26:00.042 --> 26:04.927
No, not anything like the grass singing, which got a very good review.

26:05.848 --> 26:09.932
And I knew that the New York Times would have had a very good review.

26:10.064 --> 26:18.316
I'm going to close.

26:18.397 --> 26:20.766
Would you kindly describe my picture?
