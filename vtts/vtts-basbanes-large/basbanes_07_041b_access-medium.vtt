WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:28.840
okay go ahead sir well um we're talking about the means i wish you have acquired books i gather and you said yeah and and and i'm a bachelor and therefore i do not have the expenses that people have with children and so on and i know collectors who do have wives and children and um

00:30.136 --> 00:32.839
They're just as enthusiastic, obviously.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.502
Again, we get back to the madness, the degree of the madness.

00:37.945 --> 00:56.245
So, I think the thing that I've had, maybe, is not that I had more money available than some of these people have the same means, but who are married, but I had the possibility of

00:56.478 --> 01:09.454
putting money into something without worrying about what someone else's opinion might be of that, or without worrying about children being deprived.

01:09.474 --> 01:15.441
So there have been times when I have spent more money than I should have.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.023
I don't care.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.966
Did you see this as an investment?

01:21.008 --> 01:23.751
No.

01:24.203 --> 01:31.211
Not until about 10 or 12 years ago, and then it was obvious that after Faulkner's death.

01:31.411 --> 01:42.825
And I think the usual rule is when a writer dies, his books go down and die, not up and die.

01:43.225 --> 01:53.637
But with Faulkner, that was not true, because it was like he had been underappreciated for so long that now things were firmly catching up.

01:54.157 --> 02:09.671
I think any of the books from 1951 on, from Requiem for the Moon, I don't think any of those have appreciated terribly much.

02:11.513 --> 02:17.359
But everything, up to and including collected stories, they just keep going up and up and up.

02:17.499 --> 02:22.003
And of course anything that's right, anything with

02:22.388 --> 02:29.777
I've got half a dozen with the signature, nothing inscribed, of course, to any individual.

02:29.798 --> 02:30.999
They have not come cheaply.

02:31.039 --> 02:34.844
However, you get Joe the Pro's catalog, I gather.

02:35.365 --> 02:35.465
Sure.

02:35.745 --> 02:45.958
You saw those signed limiteds that he has for $4,000 each, which is crazy, because I have three of them that he has listed them.

02:45.978 --> 02:46.719
I showed my wife.

02:46.779 --> 02:49.883
I said, look, I said, remember the books we paid $3,000 for?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.265
We got a lot, you know?

02:51.515 --> 02:54.058
in wonderful shape, you know, with the glassine.

02:54.078 --> 02:56.381
And I said, this guy's good.

02:56.401 --> 02:58.524
This guy's got a poor king of peace on him.

02:58.544 --> 03:01.388
I think those prices are outrageously high.

03:01.769 --> 03:02.530
I do, too.

03:03.631 --> 03:04.712
But that's between us.

03:04.732 --> 03:06.775
But that's what the market will bear.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.178
That's a loop that you get into and you can't get into it.

03:09.218 --> 03:10.260
What is something worth?

03:10.340 --> 03:17.269
I mean, if you can find somebody that'll buy it, that's worth that.

03:17.367 --> 03:18.188
At an auction.

03:18.228 --> 03:22.333
What did the underbidder suggest paying at an auction?

03:22.573 --> 03:28.039
Yeah, but I think that you'll have a hard time getting that kind of money back for that book.

03:28.900 --> 03:36.829
$4,000 for the Wild Poms with Glacine is a lot of money, you know?

03:38.070 --> 03:38.390
I think.

03:39.171 --> 03:39.512
Yeah.

03:40.092 --> 03:46.159
Well, Marky used to...

03:46.713 --> 04:06.112
See, Monagy was so much a product of the 20s and 30s that she would say, having seen the Galsworthy books go up and down and then drop down, she would say, I hope I never see the day.

04:06.172 --> 04:12.798
But those of you who collect Hemingway and the bottom may drop down, it is a day with Galsworthy.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.602
That was her point of view.

04:17.408 --> 04:21.312
So it never happened.

04:21.492 --> 04:26.818
But she had been burned on the hot stove, and therefore she hadn't touched the stove again.

04:26.838 --> 04:28.940
Well, Hemingway and Faulkner couldn't be harder.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.681
They couldn't be more valuable.

04:32.403 --> 04:38.269
Well, I have a very modest Hemingway collection.

04:38.289 --> 04:39.430
Pretty nice Faulkner.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.812
I lack three titles.

04:40.832 --> 04:47.078
I can only, for myself, collect the first editions.

04:48.408 --> 04:56.822
to go off and get manuscripts and letters and describe things.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.486
That's not the kind of collection I built.

04:59.667 --> 05:03.974
I think that's one of the wonderful things about collecting a letter, is that you can enjoy it at any level.

05:04.034 --> 05:05.396
Don't you think that's true?

05:05.516 --> 05:08.982
Oh yeah, that's a good thing.

05:09.755 --> 05:13.626
The collection you will see tomorrow is absolutely stunning.

05:14.148 --> 05:20.305
I mean, it is a whole room, it's a room larger than this room that we're in,

05:20.808 --> 05:27.217
with quotes and last cases and multiple copies and letters and manuscripts.

05:27.297 --> 05:29.500
It's a marvelous collection.

05:29.701 --> 05:31.003
When did I mean what?

05:31.083 --> 05:32.124
How he did this once again?

05:32.144 --> 05:36.310
You said he gave it and he sold it?

05:36.430 --> 05:37.712
No, I didn't.

05:37.732 --> 05:39.214
And he is the curator.

05:39.234 --> 05:44.902
Do you think it's his, tell me all that?

05:44.922 --> 05:45.483
Oh, yes.

05:45.603 --> 05:46.144
He sold it?

05:46.645 --> 05:47.406
I thought he gave it.

05:49.445 --> 05:57.415
He got cash for it, he got tax benefits for it, and he will be paid as curator to look over it.

05:57.435 --> 05:58.236
That's a hell of a deal.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.140
Yes, it is.

06:02.281 --> 06:03.523
Yes, it is.

06:03.583 --> 06:07.608
He's not lacking an ego.

06:07.748 --> 06:12.414
I don't know what the situation is with his family.

06:12.434 --> 06:15.638
Well, I've heard so we've... Well, okay, did you...

06:15.922 --> 06:18.030
Did he see suing his wife or something?

06:18.050 --> 06:18.673
That's right.

06:20.198 --> 06:20.620
That's right.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.033
Now that's... That's a... You did what you read.

06:24.053 --> 06:24.495
That's great.

06:24.515 --> 06:25.358
Good like that.

06:27.363 --> 06:30.166
Okay, we're back on again.

06:30.446 --> 06:48.866
I guess I'm really interested in, you read Sherwin Anderson, you read Hemingway, you read Parker, kind of a soldier's play, I guess, that captured you, is that it?

06:48.886 --> 06:49.546
No, no, no.

06:49.566 --> 06:50.207
As I lay down.

06:50.227 --> 06:51.989
As I lay down, I'm sorry.

06:52.389 --> 06:53.030
No, I didn't.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.872
I was sorry.

06:55.274 --> 07:13.485
not sherwood anderson it was the dust bassos it was the thomas i mentioned sherwood anderson in terms of uh the soldiers no the soldiers paid that i have with the inscription to sherwood and i used to have the inscription with sherwood anderson um

07:13.465 --> 07:32.157
One of the reasons that finally, aside from the fact that I felt I'm getting to the point in my life where the money is perhaps more important than the collection, the major items in the collection were all in the bank.

07:32.237 --> 07:33.820
They were all in the vault.

07:33.800 --> 07:40.733
Really?

07:40.753 --> 07:41.294
They were all out of sight.

07:41.314 --> 07:47.685
Finally, the items that are really important, the totally unique items.

07:47.705 --> 07:49.829
What are you going to do?

07:49.849 --> 07:51.272
If any go down to the bank once a week and follow them?

07:51.292 --> 07:52.454
Did you do that?

07:52.474 --> 07:52.534
No.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.879
Did you ever get out and look at them?

07:55.240 --> 07:55.781
No.

07:55.801 --> 07:56.322
So you owned them?

07:56.784 --> 08:10.033
I owned them, and I knew they were there, and I cataloged them up to 1975, and I made some attempt to catalog them afterwards, but I had a lot of them.

08:10.013 --> 08:15.121
Did you ever get bored with the collection?

08:15.141 --> 08:15.301
No.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.426
No, I never got bored with the collection.

08:18.446 --> 08:25.577
It was not an easy decision to make to sell it, but once the decision was made, I did not have a problem with that.

08:25.657 --> 08:29.643
If there's not a built-in dilemma, you know what I'm saying?

08:29.663 --> 08:38.957
Once the decision was made, let's sell the collection and initiated the action to try to do it.

08:38.937 --> 08:47.172
It did not turn out very quickly down to the institution.

08:47.192 --> 08:57.731
So finally, it was turned over to Peter Howard of Serendipity, and he had made some arrangements with Jeff Marks.

08:57.831 --> 08:59.815
And that was that.

08:59.795 --> 09:16.285
And the price is something that we negotiated at 1 o'clock in the morning, walking on the north side of Chicago from a restaurant down into the loop.

09:16.822 --> 09:33.529
There was an evening like tonight.

09:33.549 --> 09:34.290
It was a marvelously bombing evening.

09:34.310 --> 09:35.252
We walked and talked and negotiated with Peter.

09:35.232 --> 09:48.675
Peter sold me some of the very nice side of the collection.

09:48.695 --> 09:52.862
I've met Peter for a long time.

09:52.882 --> 09:59.012
And so when an attempt to sell to an institution, which is what Bob and Christine are trying to do, when that didn't work out, then I talked to them and we all agreed with it.

09:59.498 --> 10:06.527
Peter would be the next person that I would have a chance at it.

10:06.547 --> 10:10.713
Now, did Peter sell it as a collection?

10:10.733 --> 10:14.738
So he bought it from you at a price that was agreeable.

10:14.758 --> 10:20.066
Yeah, and it's very likely that tomorrow you'll see some items from the collection.

10:20.086 --> 10:25.573
And that's how I know I'm becoming mature, because I'm upset about that.

10:25.553 --> 10:41.503
all these collection

10:41.483 --> 10:49.237
It'll be like William Weston's Thomas Wolfe collection, which is one of the great ones.

10:49.277 --> 10:51.260
Where is that collection?

10:51.280 --> 10:51.481
Harvard.

10:51.561 --> 10:53.985
That's the one I like to have.

10:54.005 --> 10:54.686
What is this?

10:54.807 --> 10:58.834
Is it the Widener Library that is the rare book?

10:58.854 --> 11:02.761
The Houghton is the rare book, okay.

11:02.781 --> 11:06.327
Are you collecting anything now?

11:06.307 --> 11:10.515
Not really.

11:10.535 --> 11:13.741
What would I think about collecting?

11:14.002 --> 11:20.956
For many years I thought of collecting photographs that I want.

11:21.056 --> 11:25.044
I think it's too late for that.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.847
Or why is that?

11:26.827 --> 11:31.496
Hansel Adams, Diane Arbus, they're all too expensive.

11:31.516 --> 11:39.450
And of course, photographs are like, books are very straightforward, but photographs are like paintings.

11:39.490 --> 11:46.022
When you collect photographs, do you collect something that was printed from the studio of the photographer?

11:46.042 --> 11:47.365
Or printed by the photographer.

11:47.385 --> 11:49.408
Hansel Adams did all of his own prints.

11:49.909 --> 11:50.370
Diane Arbus

11:50.350 --> 12:15.244
i think you said on the phone that you've had no anxiety attacks about this at all i mean you don't really uh it's gone right yeah

12:15.427 --> 12:30.180
There are individual items that I think about.

12:30.660 --> 12:40.549
A soldier's pay inscribed to a war show at Anderson .

12:40.569 --> 12:42.251
Notes on a horse safe inscribed to Maeda, who's called Miss Lover.

12:42.271 --> 12:42.811
Those books were in a game.

12:42.831 --> 12:43.292
They weren't something.

12:43.312 --> 12:43.712
And besides, what...

12:44.165 --> 13:04.291
You have interviewed Carter Bird.

13:04.311 --> 13:05.432
Long before Carter Bird collected most of the paintings.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.073
And he had marvelous paintings.

13:06.093 --> 13:06.373
The paintings.

13:06.393 --> 13:07.094
Could you hang them where you live?

13:07.114 --> 13:07.675
You think of that every day.

13:08.127 --> 13:32.413
I'm not talking about now I'm talking about

13:32.393 --> 13:37.954
while you're still building the great collection.

13:37.974 --> 13:41.627
I think it's into the business of collecting.

13:42.468 --> 14:04.808
When I cataloged the material in 1975, I said that in the introduction that collective involved among other things, I'm trying to be greed.

14:04.828 --> 14:05.509
And I would maybe modify that now.

14:05.529 --> 14:05.910
Greed means to have

14:05.890 --> 14:20.052
to add to.

14:20.072 --> 14:23.157
The joy of collecting is that most people have what their status is.

14:23.137 --> 14:27.286
There's disorder in your life.

14:27.346 --> 14:38.952
It may be in terms of your occupation, it may be in terms of your family, it may be in terms of your economic situation, and it's like collecting

14:38.932 --> 14:46.622
You create your own little private world and you create order, you impose order on that.

14:46.642 --> 14:58.638
And when I did that book in 1975, I was trying to impose order in my collection.

14:58.658 --> 15:08.010
And someone would look at that and they would say, isn't that an interesting collection, the way he went out after certain holes and filled in those spaces.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.234
But I don't think that's what happens at all.

15:11.334 --> 15:15.799
You get what you can, and then you create the order afterwards.

15:16.020 --> 15:26.993
And, for instance, I had, the first Faulkner letter I bought was written to Harrison Smith.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.795
And publisher.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.198
And it was publisher.

15:31.318 --> 15:33.981
It was written in 19...

15:34.265 --> 15:46.114
Biographical details very much

15:46.651 --> 15:55.103
In February of 31, Sanctuary was published, and then in September of 31, East 13 was published.

15:55.123 --> 15:59.769
And these two books made Faulkner's early career.

16:00.611 --> 16:05.498
Before Sanctuary, Sardash and Ensemblature.

16:05.918 --> 16:08.001
Marvelous books, you know.

16:07.981 --> 16:15.589
not the sort of books that make clear.

16:15.609 --> 16:27.402
It's like a movie actor who appears in certain films and become folk films and then suddenly appears in a film that basically is considered very important.

16:27.422 --> 16:30.285
So Sanctuary has made that history.

16:30.525 --> 16:33.128
So now, in the fall of 1931, suddenly people are very interested in that.

16:33.108 --> 16:42.486
And he went to the Writers' Conference in Charlottesville in the fall.

16:42.907 --> 16:51.623
He traveled to a number of places, but eventually he ended up in New York in November, December.

16:51.603 --> 17:04.459
And Harrison Smith was having some financial difficulties.

17:04.479 --> 17:07.688
Faulkner attended parties.

17:07.870 --> 17:12.235
And then in December, he went home.

17:12.816 --> 17:28.474
But the letter I had was written there thanking him for the Baltimore tickets.

17:29.095 --> 17:35.683
I didn't know what the Baltimore tickets, I didn't know what that meant.

17:35.663 --> 17:45.473
Eventually I found out that Harrison Smith had routed Faulkner so he could stop in Baltimore and visit H.L.

17:45.493 --> 17:45.653
Lincoln.

17:45.673 --> 17:53.020
And so that letter touched on that.

17:53.621 --> 18:01.789
Then, in the same general period, Paul Romain from Casanova Books up in Milwaukee

18:02.461 --> 18:13.117
is writing the poem about collecting his double dealer material in a book which eventually became Selma Gutti.

18:14.439 --> 18:20.588
So Paul Romaine was a bookseller in Chicago for years and I eventually brought Paul Romaine's letters.

18:20.568 --> 18:28.320
Did you go out and seek out Paul Romain?

18:28.661 --> 18:37.475
He was a book dealer in Chicago, and Paul Romain told me before I heard elsewhere, oh yes, I used to deal with Paul Romain.

18:37.716 --> 18:44.787
Did you go out on the hunt to find the primary sources we might say?

18:44.767 --> 18:49.313
And this is what, again, this is what L.D.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.155
did so well.

18:50.295 --> 18:56.343
Really, L.D., he really did this very well.

18:56.423 --> 19:02.452
I knew Paul Romain because he was a book dealer in Chicago.

19:02.472 --> 19:05.396
And he would tell me about these partner letters, which he lost.

19:05.416 --> 19:09.101
And eventually he found them.

19:09.121 --> 19:11.484
And I bought them.

19:11.785 --> 19:13.407
So what happened was,

19:13.387 --> 19:16.832
And this is my example.

19:17.112 --> 19:24.503
The 1930-1931 area, I suddenly found myself putting things together.

19:24.563 --> 19:31.593
There was an issue when Faulkner was out east at the end of 1931.

19:31.613 --> 19:34.197
One of the places he went to was Chapel Hill.

19:34.615 --> 19:48.000
and he visited uh tony butita and and uh i don't remember his first name abernetti anyway contemple contemple was the was the literary publication in chapel hill

19:49.904 --> 20:03.060
So, when Faulkner died, somebody sent me a clipping from the San Francisco Chronicle, a reminiscence by Tony Butita.

20:03.080 --> 20:09.527
Well, Tony Butita was living in San Francisco in 1962 when Faulkner died.

20:09.547 --> 20:12.691
So then I got a touch with Tony Butita.

20:13.051 --> 20:15.014
Tony Butita.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.215
Tony Butita.

20:16.195 --> 20:19.341
B-U-T-T-I-T-T-A.

20:19.361 --> 20:32.027
And Tony Utena had done a piece in the San Diego literature in 1937 or 1938 called William Faulkner, The Bright Man of Oxford.

20:32.007 --> 20:43.050
So then I found out that involved with the issue of the temple, Butina had this letter from 1931.

20:43.070 --> 20:49.765
So then, you see, I'm putting all this stuff together and I was able to buy these things.

20:50.206 --> 20:50.927
So I got it.

20:51.346 --> 20:56.014
Very knowledgeable about 1931 and Faulkner's life.

20:56.235 --> 21:09.017
And if someday somebody wants to have a list of all the experts on Faulkner's life beside me, 1931.

21:08.997 --> 21:15.925
So that's how you impose order after you have the opportunity to acquire it.

21:15.945 --> 21:22.653
Did you think that you were building a scholarly archive or were you building a collection?

21:22.793 --> 21:33.105
Actually, the answer to that is very similar to the answer to investment.

21:33.386 --> 21:35.308
You kind of ride along

21:35.542 --> 21:38.086
Have a good time.

21:38.106 --> 21:39.609
Satisfy yourself.

21:39.729 --> 21:46.581
And then one day you look at it and you say, this is of scholarly interest.

21:46.601 --> 21:54.876
And you say to yourself, this is worth money.

21:54.976 --> 21:59.203
Make a nice bite.

21:59.183 --> 22:00.265
Good.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.607
I like a little bite.

22:01.627 --> 22:06.034
I know that.

22:06.835 --> 22:14.948
The reason I ask that question is you say, well,

22:15.940 --> 22:28.204
Things tended to nucleate, apparently, and 1931 appeared to be a very exciting year, and a year that you had some primary material.

22:28.304 --> 22:33.915
Meanwhile, you see, in 1931, to put myself in the picture, I was two years old.

22:35.431 --> 22:55.431
I'm writing a

22:55.411 --> 22:58.317
I'm writing a master's and a THC.

22:58.337 --> 23:05.553
I remember this in 1931, and I find out that Carl Peterson had this archive.

23:05.954 --> 23:11.064
Could I come and see your stuff when you had it?

23:11.085 --> 23:12.728
Yeah, okay, sure.

23:12.708 --> 23:16.896
Did you ever get any requests like that?

23:17.477 --> 23:28.236
Did you ever grant access of your materials for scholars?

23:28.216 --> 23:34.590
The requests came from people that I already respected.

23:34.690 --> 23:36.514
I mentioned Carvalho.

23:36.614 --> 23:42.166
But he was interested in everything.

23:42.707 --> 23:44.571
He was, what did he like?

23:44.551 --> 23:50.219
He was interviewing people.

23:50.239 --> 24:05.082
Alas, he never wrote his biography, but he was interested in people before they died.

24:05.102 --> 24:06.103
He taped material and transcribed material.

24:06.505 --> 24:09.357
No one came out of nowhere.

24:09.538 --> 24:17.089
I'm going to put the machine on for a second.

24:17.913 --> 24:24.924
I don't want you to think I'm doing anything.

24:25.044 --> 24:28.309
I've known Robert for 20 years.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.633
Robert Neville.

24:30.693 --> 24:33.017
Robert and Christine have a good place.

24:33.037 --> 24:36.422
They tell me you're an okay person.

24:36.462 --> 24:38.545
They're getting acknowledgments in my book.

24:38.565 --> 24:41.430
They tell me you're an okay person.

24:41.951 --> 24:45.456
If I wanted to demolish an elderly to an okay person,

24:45.436 --> 24:48.747
I would simply sequence things that he had written.

24:49.115 --> 24:56.363
I will forward them to you with no comment.

24:56.503 --> 25:05.454
I don't know what you've read, but it's written.

25:05.474 --> 25:09.919
Oh, it's... I've learned more about him than I do about when you talk to him.

25:09.939 --> 25:10.900
He has poet on his license plate.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.622
Does he really?

25:12.642 --> 25:14.584
He has poet.

25:14.604 --> 25:14.965
L.D.

25:14.985 --> 25:15.785
Bartzki poet.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.147
And he sent me his... Christ, I don't want this in the same way.

25:17.617 --> 25:27.913
I will not be sued by anyone.

25:28.073 --> 25:34.123
I can assure you that I am.

25:34.424 --> 25:40.853
He came up there, I don't know what year it was, with his brother-in-law.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.435
I thought he was patronizing me.

25:44.818 --> 25:47.662
And I guess I never got over feeling that.

25:48.483 --> 25:55.493
But the very first time I visited him, his wife was pregnant with their second child.

25:55.513 --> 25:58.457
And afterwards...

25:58.437 --> 26:05.967
I stayed with him in Farmington.

26:06.107 --> 26:12.195
And I wrote a note afterwards.

26:12.415 --> 26:19.685
And she said that I was the very first person I would ever stand back who wrote afterwards and thanked her.

26:20.186 --> 26:25.052
And she said it was a very difficult time because she was in an uncomfortable period.

26:25.032 --> 26:35.462
I spent a number of times with them when there was lightning in the air.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.564
It was very unpleasant.

26:38.925 --> 26:41.787
You mean between those two?

26:42.288 --> 26:44.690
Between those two.

26:44.710 --> 26:47.453
Trust me, I'm not touching that one.

26:47.973 --> 26:54.499
Because I'm interested in book collecting.

26:54.479 --> 27:13.669
And one of the things is, in the suburban supplement

27:13.649 --> 27:29.295
we had an article last year and i showed it to people i work with some people i i work in a you know for a paint company and the people i work with have no interest they don't know where and i showed them

27:29.275 --> 27:33.642
this article and then it was an urban supplement.

27:33.923 --> 27:44.601
And his father, who was a millionaire, one of the things he was about was a clothing manufacturer.

27:44.581 --> 27:52.012
And that's all over now, Mr. Swathers, into the Martell U.N., and so on.

27:52.032 --> 28:10.338
But this article said how he would sometimes go back to the clothing factory, and how when he would come into the clothing factory, the employees' faces would light up to see him, and flecks of joy would come into their eyes.

28:10.738 --> 28:11.179
Yes.

28:11.446 --> 28:25.928
Well, he's quoted, and this is quoted as a flex of joy, which, you know, when I look out of the molten eye in someone's eye, a flex of joy within their eyes, which, you know, and...

28:26.363 --> 28:32.773
One of my co-workers says, oh, I'm going to see you.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.036
Oh, Mr.

28:34.136 --> 28:38.663
L.D., please don't see you.

28:38.703 --> 28:42.870
Look at that one, that's nice.

28:42.850 --> 28:50.919
Would you say that you were rivals in any way for the same material?

28:52.081 --> 29:11.743
There is one point I really want to make, not to be published, but between me and you, that Faulkner is not the reason why he and I fell apart.

29:11.723 --> 29:18.794
Well, there's the only reason why we temporarily came together.

29:18.814 --> 29:30.373
He is the sort of person that he met at a reunion, at a dinner party.

29:30.353 --> 29:38.648
business meeting, temperamentally, we haven't had any time.

29:39.109 --> 29:45.561
And we never would have had any kind of friendship.

29:45.743 --> 29:50.748
So Faulkner brought us together rather than separated.

29:50.768 --> 29:56.192
Can I assume that he sought you out?

29:56.353 --> 30:12.827
But were you ever rivaled to the same material?

30:12.847 --> 30:14.309
This is extraordinary.

30:14.329 --> 30:15.750
Only once.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.053
Only once.

30:18.073 --> 30:29.169
And that was after we were no longer involved with each other.

30:29.290 --> 30:36.600
Someone in the Balkan family had some material to set on.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.082
This is on now?

30:38.102 --> 30:38.323
Mm-hmm.

30:38.643 --> 30:40.466
Water up?

30:40.486 --> 30:42.008
Yeah.

30:42.427 --> 30:46.453
For 40 years, there have been very few unpleasant experiences.

30:46.473 --> 30:48.235
I'd like to say that.

30:48.255 --> 30:49.477
I've met a lot of people.

30:50.058 --> 30:54.043
I never would have met otherwise.

30:54.063 --> 30:59.811
Somebody has really, really delightful people.

30:59.871 --> 31:12.028
When you would buy an exquisite association property, if you ever physically read that, are you buying an artifact?

31:12.008 --> 31:40.834
You know, usually by the time you're buying something like that, the text is something you've already digested.

31:40.814 --> 31:52.227
I think I was collecting for 10 or 15 years before I read what I would call the middle books.

31:53.789 --> 32:02.539
And the middle books are Pylon and Absalom Absalom and Wild Poms.

32:03.640 --> 32:09.707
Now, if I start collecting in 1948, which is in my book,

32:09.687 --> 32:15.341
I'm buying Intruder in the Dust when it came out.

32:15.361 --> 32:17.146
And I'm buying everything into that.

32:17.767 --> 32:20.213
And I'm reading that.

32:20.294 --> 32:25.266
And meanwhile I'm going back and I'm reading The Sound of the Fury and

32:25.246 --> 32:28.731
and soldiers pay and so forth.

32:28.751 --> 32:39.106
Those middle books, which I don't get around with for a long, long time.

32:39.126 --> 32:42.371
You read them in reader's editions?

32:42.571 --> 32:46.277
I read some of them in first editions.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.161
I read Absalom Absalom in the first editions.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.025
That's a tough ball.

32:51.045 --> 32:54.392
What is the magic of the first edition?

32:54.592 --> 33:03.330
I collect them.

33:03.450 --> 33:06.897
It's the...

33:07.450 --> 33:15.768
It's like you're getting about as close as you can get for most readers to the writer.

33:16.851 --> 33:26.151
I wrote Joseph The Provider this past week about his 20th anniversary catalog, and I said,

33:26.890 --> 33:44.578
he misspelled margie's last name he spelled it c-o-h-e-n c-o-h-n and i said it's possible that there is a an afterlife for book people and if there is uh i will probably get there before ralph sicker gets there

33:44.558 --> 33:48.405
And the way I picture this after life, it's not heaven or heaven.

33:48.425 --> 33:49.207
It's a book fair.

33:49.227 --> 33:52.133
It's a gigantic book fair.

33:52.153 --> 33:56.401
And everything is on display and nothing is for sale.

33:56.982 --> 34:01.150
And that, for instance,

34:01.130 --> 34:06.498
Bibli Octopus, who is, I can't remember his name now.

34:06.518 --> 34:08.140
This guy out of Canada, right?

34:08.160 --> 34:12.487
No, this is, this is, actually this is Dinah Shore's son-in-law.

34:12.927 --> 34:14.830
I can't remember his name.

34:14.850 --> 34:17.554
The Bibli Octopus would have the Ten Commandments and help.

34:19.357 --> 34:23.543
Hamlin Barker and Lorin Howell.

34:23.523 --> 34:30.790
jointly will have the Ten Commandments on the original tablets.

34:30.910 --> 34:36.276
And Rosenbach will have the proof copy on fired clay stones.

34:36.416 --> 34:40.560
And so that's the first edition.

34:40.580 --> 34:45.665
I mean, the closer you can get to the writer, there's something kind of mystical.

34:45.745 --> 34:49.969
Has this happened or is this hell?

34:50.389 --> 34:52.011
Is it in the dark?

34:51.991 --> 35:09.848
this is well i told ralph that a market catches him for

35:09.828 --> 35:23.308
Miss Scully, that'll be hell.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.023
Good stuff, man.

35:33.043 --> 35:33.724
You still read Cluckman?

35:33.744 --> 35:33.844
Yeah.

35:33.824 --> 35:35.927
Not lately.

35:37.811 --> 35:46.545
You see, I read them too much.

35:46.685 --> 35:50.972
And I ended up with Panama.

35:50.952 --> 36:04.164
It's a lot of skewed education.

36:04.565 --> 36:16.236
And consequently, years later, I read Joseph Conrad, and this is my dad.

36:16.256 --> 36:19.879
We've got a lot of his ideas.

36:19.859 --> 36:23.684
And two people with a classical education, that would have sounded funny.

36:24.385 --> 36:28.872
They would have read Conrad longer before they read Conrad.

36:28.932 --> 36:31.776
Well, did you have a 30-inch July clock on Conrad?

36:31.796 --> 36:32.116
Yes.

36:33.618 --> 36:34.420
Did you?

36:35.101 --> 36:35.161
No.

36:35.181 --> 36:40.849
You only collected Conrad?

36:40.929 --> 36:44.294
I collected Saw Bellow for a while.

36:44.314 --> 36:44.554
Chicago.

36:44.574 --> 36:46.657
Eudora Welty for a while.

36:46.677 --> 36:48.820
I love Eudora Welty.

36:48.800 --> 37:09.581
Why did you quit?

37:09.601 --> 37:10.202
Collecting wealthy and mellow.

37:10.222 --> 37:11.044
I could only afford to collect one rider.

37:11.024 --> 37:13.767
I collected Edward Albee for a while.

37:13.847 --> 37:17.311
I collected Nelson Alderman for a while.

37:17.331 --> 37:18.733
Alderman, I understand.

37:18.753 --> 37:19.114
Why Alderman?

37:19.134 --> 37:19.995
Did it seem to be better?

37:20.015 --> 37:20.095
No.

37:20.115 --> 37:21.797
Oh, he's a New Yorker, right?

37:22.177 --> 37:27.804
I saw a couple of his plays, and I thought they were spectacular.

37:27.824 --> 37:30.187
Just about a couple of them are all good.

37:30.207 --> 37:33.470
Only about two of them are good.

37:33.490 --> 37:38.196
In fact, a delicate balance is Virginia Woolf, you know, updated everything.

37:38.176 --> 37:47.506
Don't worry about it.

37:47.526 --> 37:58.298
I don't know what I saw first.

37:58.558 --> 38:01.502
I really don't remember.

38:01.522 --> 38:06.607
I did see Virginia walking in the water.

38:06.627 --> 38:06.928
But who was it?

38:06.948 --> 38:07.729
It was Udahagan and Arthur Lake, maybe?

38:07.749 --> 38:08.149
I never, never know.

38:08.129 --> 38:29.718
Did you ever go and get to buy any goods?

38:29.738 --> 38:37.208
Well, with Margie, you would...

38:37.188 --> 38:53.573
You could take your time without paying your bills as long as you had a kind of a plan.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.338
Well, put it out of the way.

38:57.639 --> 39:01.124
Did you ever buy something that you couldn't afford?

39:01.144 --> 39:01.204
No.

39:01.994 --> 39:28.592
because the two people that most frequently I was paying off in installments, either Margie or Peter Howard.

39:28.572 --> 39:42.090
Well, I'm not going to embarrass you by asking you what you paid for something and what you didn't pay.

39:42.110 --> 39:46.936
But there certainly must have been things that you had to cringe at.

39:46.956 --> 39:54.987
You said you gave yourself a price, but the collection was so important that you said, I have to have it.

39:55.067 --> 39:55.688
Did that ever happen?

39:55.708 --> 39:56.689
Well, at a certain point,

39:56.669 --> 40:15.086
$500 is a tremendous amount of money, and then another point in my life, $3,000 is a tremendous amount of money.

40:15.106 --> 40:16.990
As I got older and the notion of what constitutes a lot of money and change,

40:17.763 --> 40:26.595
Things that I couldn't pay off in one month were something special.

40:26.635 --> 40:33.865
We love black bread or anything.

40:34.165 --> 40:40.834
Is there anything you ever passed on that you regret?

40:40.814 --> 40:59.143
i don't think so i can't remember

40:59.123 --> 41:08.139
Out of Marty, she would make sure that they didn't pass.

41:08.159 --> 41:17.896
Did you have a sense that you were building the preeminent collection while you were building it?

41:17.916 --> 41:17.976
No.

41:17.956 --> 41:36.893
The only thing I sensed for a long time was Linton Massey at the University of Virginia.

41:36.873 --> 41:50.010
William Wisdom down in New Orleans, who in addition to his Thomas Malkin material, had some very fine Faulkner.

41:50.911 --> 41:59.742
For a long time I sensed the notion that, gee, I'm about the youngest of the Faulkner collectors.

41:59.722 --> 42:15.773
At about what point did you decide?

42:15.753 --> 42:26.487
It was time to give the books a new life, meaning that you would have them.

42:26.507 --> 42:32.836
And certainly the most valuable ones were in the vault, but they were yours.

42:34.138 --> 42:43.330
So now it's time to move them along.

42:43.715 --> 42:45.137
Something you thought about?

42:45.598 --> 42:49.985
Really, a fairly long time ago.

42:50.005 --> 42:57.518
I mean, between five and ten years before I actually sold it.

42:57.538 --> 43:08.035
I realistically thought, someday, this material is going to be the basis of my retirement.

43:08.015 --> 43:16.774
And so I'm going to have to decide when that time comes.

43:17.455 --> 43:25.753
And I hope the collection can be kept together in a university or an institutional library.

43:25.733 --> 43:28.355
That didn't happen.

43:28.375 --> 43:34.081
It's like this is not a unique thing.

43:34.321 --> 43:44.611
Your life is filled with decisions that become accretions of change rather than perhaps something.

43:44.771 --> 43:53.339
Hey, today I decided I'm going to be an Army General.

43:53.359 --> 43:54.660
It doesn't happen that way.

43:55.703 --> 44:01.755
But, you know, Bradley Martin saw about his collection.

44:01.776 --> 44:03.239
Is he still alive?

44:03.459 --> 44:04.942
Oh, he's dead.

44:05.042 --> 44:12.578
I went to most of the sales of his return, which realized $36 million or some such thing.

44:13.460 --> 44:17.087
But he had lots of steel money, you know.

44:17.067 --> 44:23.134
and that he had nothing to do throughout his life except by beautiful books.

44:23.314 --> 44:33.185
And it would have been nice if the Ornithological Collection could have been kept together, but that was quite extremely extraordinary.

44:33.205 --> 44:41.555
But the Bessemer Steel Trust, which was executor of the estate, decided that the estate was best served by selling it off.

44:41.655 --> 44:44.458
So, you know, don't feel like you...

44:44.438 --> 44:47.171
You've done a disservice to scholarship.

44:47.473 --> 44:48.739
It happens all the time.

44:49.101 --> 44:52.879
And I don't think that the popular study of

44:53.433 --> 45:19.288
to pursue the cognitive scholarship is going to be as wonderful as your collection is everybody who bought those things are going to take care of them and i don't think that they necessarily have to be kept in my own feelings but i'm sure they're making cool it would have been nice if we could have gone to an institute but it didn't happen is that right it was not

45:19.268 --> 45:38.215
The material at Charlottesville, Virginia, is still the best single collection.

45:38.416 --> 45:41.720
You'll hear otherwise tomorrow, but that is a fact.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.363
Whose collection is this?

45:43.683 --> 45:47.048
This is a combination of Linton Massey's collection.

45:47.028 --> 45:53.842
And I went to the University of Virginia.

45:54.203 --> 45:59.735
I went to the University of Virginia.

45:59.835 --> 46:04.665
I went to the University of Virginia.

46:04.645 --> 46:18.371
When the machine is off, I'm going to ask you to give me some ideas of things that you'd like to ask me if you were sitting in the car looking for me.

46:20.976 --> 46:26.426
What would you like me to ask?

46:26.446 --> 46:28.189
I'll shut this up.

46:28.422 --> 46:58.362
Let's talk

46:58.342 --> 47:00.766
Do you believe that on a commercial basis?

47:01.407 --> 47:04.432
You don't have to believe that.

47:04.452 --> 47:09.801
That's kind of a temperamental thing about collecting.

47:09.821 --> 47:11.264
I want to get as close as possible.

47:11.304 --> 47:12.306
Do you collect proofs?

47:12.606 --> 47:14.950
I had a few.

47:14.930 --> 47:24.321
The finest I had was one of the proofs of the unrevised sanctuary before it was changed.

47:24.341 --> 47:28.826
Well, that's a significant unrevised.

47:28.947 --> 47:29.747
Oh, yeah.

47:29.868 --> 47:35.094
Yeah, because there was tremendous revisions.

47:35.775 --> 47:42.102
But, see, paid proofs now are down to, you know, five or six hundred copies when they send them out.

47:42.976 --> 47:48.041
And then all they do is take it and print it on the paper and bind it and then that's the first position.

47:48.061 --> 47:51.385
And I don't think that's worth a thousand dollars for anyone, you know?

47:52.546 --> 47:54.027
All right, you read your books.

47:54.047 --> 47:54.888
How do you get them?

47:54.908 --> 47:56.750
They're all bound books, aren't they?

47:56.770 --> 47:57.771
No, I get proofs.

47:57.791 --> 47:58.692
Do you get proofs?

47:58.932 --> 48:00.574
Yeah, I get proofs.

48:00.594 --> 48:02.876
I might get it by a ton, you know.

48:03.137 --> 48:05.959
We're talking, you know, many of which are disposable.

48:06.280 --> 48:07.841
Most of which are disposable.

48:08.062 --> 48:08.562
Sure.

48:08.542 --> 48:11.968
You know, I'm not talking just about novels.

48:12.088 --> 48:18.599
I'm talking about everything.

48:18.699 --> 48:23.808
And many of them know that they do.

48:23.848 --> 48:30.499
This is really wonderful.

48:31.559 --> 48:35.564
Why are the early corporate books so valuable?

48:35.584 --> 48:40.190
The early corporate books are so valuable, but there aren't many of them.

48:40.210 --> 48:41.331
What's the printing?

48:41.351 --> 48:43.013
The printing was so small.

48:43.313 --> 48:45.296
I'm saying the same thing.

48:45.316 --> 48:48.660
There aren't many of them.

48:48.700 --> 48:51.964
What's the printing of the new novelist novels?

48:53.058 --> 49:00.761
I don't read a novel to be able to name some new novelists.

49:01.684 --> 49:06.578
But I do see reviews, and 10,000 would not be any color.

49:07.132 --> 49:08.694
Well, that's not bad.

49:08.954 --> 49:12.117
I mean, we only fought for $2,000.

49:13.899 --> 49:17.123
But I have a sense that everything's $100,000.

49:17.163 --> 49:23.650
That everybody would be making a lot of money.

49:23.810 --> 49:26.953
Or having a lot of remainders.

49:27.033 --> 49:31.198
Well, I'll be very lucky.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.721
We're talking about Luke Feldman.

49:33.741 --> 49:34.962
What did you just say?

49:35.954 --> 49:38.620
This was in the 1960s.

49:38.640 --> 49:46.898
He had a Faulkner collection in one of his catalogs and he did not own it.

49:46.958 --> 49:52.410
And the way I knew that was that I had asked

49:52.390 --> 49:59.303
Warren Howell, San Francisco, to look for some Faulkner material.

50:00.165 --> 50:11.226
And Warren Howell sent me, uh, phoned me and said that he had the Faulkner material, a couple of items that I had requested on my one list.

50:11.830 --> 50:28.810
said he had recently bought a collection asked him if he would send me the full list and he did then i took the list and i compared it with felton's catalog description it was identical

50:28.790 --> 50:34.658
I mean, there were things missing on both lists, and there were English editions that were on both lists.

50:34.678 --> 50:35.720
So what was going on there?

50:36.040 --> 50:45.474
Feldman was trying to sell the collection, and he put it in his catalog, and he did not own it.

50:45.494 --> 50:47.256
So what if you called Feldman and honored him?

50:47.296 --> 50:48.077
What would happen?

50:48.117 --> 50:52.523
What saved you on?

50:52.543 --> 50:55.067
I won't guess.

50:55.756 --> 50:57.579
Did you try?

50:58.180 --> 50:58.541
No.

50:59.963 --> 51:03.129
This was 25 years ago.

51:04.431 --> 51:12.105
I'm wondering why he would put something in his list and he couldn't set it.

51:12.125 --> 51:14.389
Just to do a little more stature?

51:14.369 --> 51:41.271
i don't know or another question might be if you took that whole catalog how many of the items in the catalog did he actually own now it's one thing to have things on consignment but it's another thing to pretend that you have something on consignment

51:41.842 --> 51:55.311
I'm back on

51:55.730 --> 52:03.078
You built the collection for 40 years.

52:03.579 --> 52:09.045
Did it have any special meaning to you?

52:09.426 --> 52:12.309
Is it a hobby or something?

52:12.909 --> 52:17.274
It's kind of center of sanity.

52:18.075 --> 52:23.121
As I said to you, the collection is a means of

52:23.101 --> 52:28.110
creating order in one portion of your life.

52:29.252 --> 52:44.839
So this was something that, any mistakes, any advantages, any triumphs, there was no one to blame, no one else to credit.

52:44.819 --> 52:49.985
How about mistakes?

52:50.286 --> 53:00.518
Did you make mistakes with the fortune?

53:02.841 --> 53:09.409
Did you buy things and play them?

53:09.389 --> 53:12.134
Did you make mistakes with acquisitions?

53:12.836 --> 53:19.148
Were you pretty astute from the beginning?

53:21.253 --> 53:24.218
I don't think so.

53:24.239 --> 53:30.030
I don't know if I made a mistake.

53:30.668 --> 53:34.232
They don't bring anything else now.

53:34.292 --> 53:39.497
Everything was a pretty solid purchase.

53:40.438 --> 53:49.127
There was a couple of times when it seemed like something was too expensive to say.

53:49.207 --> 53:50.088
Pardon me, sir.

53:50.188 --> 53:50.949
Excuse me.

53:50.969 --> 53:52.871
I've got all this part up.

53:54.172 --> 53:58.617
Oh, it's coming off.

53:59.204 --> 54:00.426
Oh my gosh.

54:02.188 --> 54:07.837
The fall of 1962.

54:07.917 --> 54:18.833
Yes, I like that.

54:18.813 --> 54:22.622
and the number of limited editions were there, including wrote Onnosis.

54:22.782 --> 54:29.197
And Margie called me and told me it was there, and so on.

54:29.217 --> 54:34.308
And he asked the people who was good at that.

54:34.449 --> 54:37.716
And he said, well, I know it's on Spencer's book,

54:37.696 --> 54:46.033
But there is a lot of $500.

54:46.133 --> 54:50.402
And she told me after the sale, she said, you better be sitting down.

54:50.542 --> 54:51.404
It's okay.

54:51.424 --> 54:57.797
And I think I went for $600, and then her 10% is on that, and then it's $660.

54:57.777 --> 55:04.788
That shook a whole bunch of copies for a long period of time.

55:05.529 --> 55:10.397
Henry Waddington had a copy for $450.

55:10.538 --> 55:13.683
You mean your purchase of that shook the audience loose?

55:13.703 --> 55:14.244
Yeah.

55:14.264 --> 55:15.786
And who was the underbidder?

55:15.766 --> 55:22.221
My point is if you paid $600, somebody had to pay $580.

55:22.622 --> 55:28.255
All I'm saying is that it went up to that area and then a couple of copies came out in catalogs.

55:28.376 --> 55:31.523
As they inevitably do, right?

55:31.543 --> 55:34.450
And then it started going back.

55:34.430 --> 55:39.960
Yeah, but you told her 500 and yet she went and got it for six.

55:39.980 --> 55:40.081
Yeah.

55:40.101 --> 55:41.002
So she knew.

55:41.022 --> 55:41.423
She knew.

55:42.405 --> 55:43.327
She knew you'd buy it.

55:43.347 --> 55:44.248
There was no problem.

55:44.269 --> 55:47.955
Well, she knew that she doesn't have the money.

55:48.176 --> 55:49.138
Yeah, right.

55:49.198 --> 55:50.380
It's just kind of a...

55:50.360 --> 55:55.549
It's a marvelous relationship that a lot of collectors have with a lot of dealers.

55:55.569 --> 55:57.853
Now, I don't know anything about antiques.

55:57.873 --> 56:00.738
I suspect the same thing happens there.

56:00.758 --> 56:02.602
I don't know anything about, you know, floral paintings.

56:02.702 --> 56:05.346
I suspect the same thing happens there.

56:05.366 --> 56:13.701
You know, somebody might say, I'll bid $20 million and I'll end up paying $22 million.

56:13.681 --> 56:24.720
that's just the way it is

56:25.105 --> 56:25.866
Margie.

56:25.986 --> 56:27.848
Margie or Margie?

56:27.868 --> 56:28.409
Margie.

56:28.429 --> 56:29.009
Archie.

56:29.029 --> 56:29.590
Archie.

56:29.750 --> 56:35.596
But yeah, you get to meet her basically through the catalogs, right?

56:35.616 --> 56:35.997
Yeah.

56:36.017 --> 56:37.919
Going back into the early 50s.

56:38.539 --> 56:41.443
You know, we need our special desserts this evening.

56:41.463 --> 56:51.113
We have a delicious mascarpone tort, and there's crumbled becans, triple cream of cramon cheese, top of sliced ham.

56:51.245 --> 56:58.555
This is a clean roulette with vanilla-baked custard.

56:58.675 --> 57:02.981
It has a whole caramelized pasta.

57:03.101 --> 57:06.085
Red raspberries, of course, serve cream on the lid.

57:06.165 --> 57:08.668
I would kill for red raspberries.

57:08.688 --> 57:10.390
No, sir, just get the main for those.

57:10.410 --> 57:12.113
They're killing here.

57:12.153 --> 57:13.755
Simple main will do.

57:13.915 --> 57:16.078
I'll bring him right there.

57:16.318 --> 57:17.680
This is a lemon.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.003
I'll have that lemon.

57:20.590 --> 57:25.215
I shouldn't have trouble getting that.

57:25.235 --> 57:25.576
Go ahead.

57:25.656 --> 57:27.238
Do you want the manuscript part?

57:27.258 --> 57:29.500
I think she did that in the afternoon.

57:29.721 --> 57:34.126
She paid $14,000, which seemed like a lot of money there.

57:34.226 --> 57:45.699
I saw a sign anyway, just a sign, inscribed to a non-entery, built for $28,000 at Bradley Martinsale.

57:46.200 --> 57:50.445
I'm sure that wherever that is, I'll bet it's going to be a ticket now, is that right?

57:50.425 --> 58:06.291
has to be that went immediately to texas that was that was back in the days when they were buying bigger uh as far as the book is concerned i had a copy because it's a fortune item there's this there's the business where uh

58:06.271 --> 58:30.439
Let's see what are the kinkiest items ever went after the brick from the post office I did have some maps

58:30.419 --> 58:41.953
And I did have one of his pipes, which I bought from his stepson.

58:42.133 --> 58:44.796
Where's that?

58:44.856 --> 58:48.220
That's in the collection, yeah.

58:48.420 --> 58:50.042
So what's happened to the collection?

58:50.062 --> 58:51.724
Do you get any reports?

58:52.405 --> 58:54.267
Do you get feedback?

58:54.287 --> 58:59.093
I talked to Peter's dad.

58:59.073 --> 59:21.975
our deal was that it would be paid two halves and the second half was last july and i asked him about how i was going and he told me a number of institutional libraries i don't know if

59:22.377 --> 59:39.636
Carter said he deals with three people, Ralph Zipper, Peter Howard, and Glenn Horowitz.

59:39.777 --> 59:44.622
His name was three.

59:44.602 --> 59:53.133
University of Virginia bought a poetry type script.

59:53.153 --> 59:55.996
I think University of Texas bought some things.

59:56.016 --> 01:00:02.384
The three great institutional collections are Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas.

01:00:02.404 --> 01:00:04.787
Now, weather, a lot of one stone food.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:08.713
I don't know.

01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:17.587
It deserves to be put into class with the other three.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:25.459
But obviously Virginia is the premier.
