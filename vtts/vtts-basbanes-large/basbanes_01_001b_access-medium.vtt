WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:13.144
They said that you collected in 45 different states, is that correct?

00:15.147 --> 00:17.811
Not books.

00:18.592 --> 00:26.444
See what they found, how they come to these figures about the number of places I went.

00:27.546 --> 00:30.190
I used to collect book plates

00:31.013 --> 00:35.218
as well as brochures and library catalogs.

00:35.238 --> 00:36.019
So do I, by the way.

00:36.039 --> 00:38.342
That's a very legitimate collectible.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.104
Book plates are wonderful.

00:40.264 --> 00:40.865
Yeah.

00:40.945 --> 00:42.787
I've got a John Quinn book plate.

00:42.827 --> 00:45.510
John Quinn was a wonderful collector in 1922.

00:45.951 --> 00:49.975
I collect catalogs of collectors, too, and sale catalogs and stuff.

00:49.995 --> 00:55.642
There's a book called American College Book Plates that I had a copy, and I used to use that as a reference point.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.184
You saw my book plate collection.

00:57.204 --> 00:58.285
You're using it as evidence.

00:58.305 --> 00:59.046
That's right, yeah.

01:00.038 --> 01:05.525
Now, were those book plates removed from books that you had acquired, or were they a combination of books?

01:05.545 --> 01:13.735
Some were out of collections of book plates that I'd acquired.

01:13.755 --> 01:16.098
I had a book plate for the New York Public Library.

01:16.118 --> 01:20.022
I've never been in the New York Public Library.

01:20.042 --> 01:24.628
But they must have the New York Public Library checking desperately to see if the... Yeah, yeah.

01:25.351 --> 01:31.121
I'm hoping, you know, when this is resolved, I'll assist them.

01:31.141 --> 01:35.868
Will you?

01:35.888 --> 01:42.119
Do you think you're going to tell them specifically how you did things, too?

01:42.339 --> 01:45.925
They seem to be pretty much onto it in the evidence.

01:46.580 --> 01:55.250
Quite a bit of it was done so long, though I'm sure they've done some remodeling, and there's institutions I haven't been in in 18 years, you know.

01:55.270 --> 02:03.200
I'm sure that if I go back to certain places, the buildings, the structures might not even exist anymore, you know.

02:03.220 --> 02:13.752
You know, if you had decided to be a regular professional thief, you could have been very, very... I would think you could have been very successful at it, I suppose.

02:15.740 --> 02:17.242
Let me ask you a straight out question.

02:17.262 --> 02:17.923
You don't have to answer it.

02:17.943 --> 02:19.165
Do you consider yourself a thief?

02:21.748 --> 02:21.989
Oh.

02:26.315 --> 02:38.432
Knowing that I preserve the stuff that, yes, in a way that other unknowns to me who may have wanted access to the material missed out, that I feel bad about.

02:38.752 --> 02:45.021
Although I've given people access to my stuff who otherwise would have never have known of it.

02:45.929 --> 02:48.513
What do you mean like people like?

02:48.533 --> 02:56.485
Dwayne Olsen and Billy Laquay and the old whino that I knew in Minneapolis.

02:56.505 --> 03:01.954
See, I haven't been in Des Moines much, so you can't talk to these guys about the particulars of book collecting.

03:02.254 --> 03:04.097
It's too bad you couldn't do an interview with me.

03:04.117 --> 03:09.305
Maybe sometime you can do an interview of me in Minneapolis with my group of guys.

03:10.587 --> 03:14.333
And you can go up to a guy like Adam and ask them about...

03:14.785 --> 03:18.371
and you'll know what it is, you know, these technical terms.

03:18.451 --> 03:25.061
At what point did you decide to elevate your collection?

03:25.161 --> 03:26.884
Into printing and that?

03:27.144 --> 03:30.489
Well, say from the general stacks into special collections.

03:30.930 --> 03:37.941
When I ran out of material that I couldn't find in the general stacks.

03:38.377 --> 03:44.403
And you also decided, apparently, to go beyond the printed book, but to manuscript material as well.

03:44.864 --> 03:45.745
Oh, just a little bit.

03:45.765 --> 03:48.808
I touched lightly on it.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.170
But mainly it was the printed book, then?

03:51.190 --> 03:51.290
Yeah.

03:51.411 --> 04:01.341
Well, no, mainly it was architecture and views of areas and American history.

04:01.861 --> 04:04.384
Well, what was the pertinence then of the Nuremberg Chronicle?

04:04.651 --> 04:10.401
Well, yeah, about three years ago I got into printing.

04:12.384 --> 04:14.708
I had over a hundred incunables.

04:15.449 --> 04:21.900
That's quite an impressive assemblage in three years in the late 20th century, isn't it?

04:24.023 --> 04:30.612
Yeah, you know what's happening, don't you?

04:32.916 --> 04:34.638
I don't mean to be interrupted.

04:34.658 --> 04:40.787
Well, he wants to know what we're laughing about, right?

04:41.428 --> 04:42.289
No, no.

04:43.611 --> 04:53.305
I think it's a nice thing that I got Steve here to talk to and everything because, I mean,

04:53.521 --> 05:02.217
Like, I think it was a month and a half ago, I was beat up by four people in the game.

05:04.140 --> 05:11.073
And, I mean, it's nice because Steve invited me down to his house for a while to see if I wanted to stay there for a while.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.197
That thing's pulled out up in New Moines.

05:14.199 --> 05:17.605
I mean, it's just nice to know that he's there if I need him.

05:20.572 --> 05:24.483
That make you feel good when people talk about you like that?

05:24.503 --> 05:26.729
Yeah, yeah.

05:26.749 --> 05:29.135
I haven't known Adam that long in the way, trust me.

05:29.155 --> 05:35.593
You ought to see how those boys in Minneapolis have known for ten, eight, ten years, you know.

05:37.480 --> 05:58.138
in a sense they've you know they've had single parent homes like duane only has his father and i've been like a substitute you know i can't be a mother it's really nice that people that are older like steve kids know and be friends with younger people like myself and kevin

06:03.502 --> 06:07.367
Well, you're getting to meet people from different areas, like Mr. Fasbini.

06:07.407 --> 06:09.009
Here's from the East Coast.

06:09.029 --> 06:11.572
I've spent a lot of time with these New Englanders and that there.

06:11.592 --> 06:12.553
Did you ever get up to Maine?

06:13.294 --> 06:13.815
A little bit.

06:13.835 --> 06:16.478
I've got a friend that's a record collector in Brunswick.

06:16.858 --> 06:18.060
I went, well, that's where Bowdoin is.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.922
I went to Bates College up in Lewiston.

06:20.623 --> 06:21.584
That's my college.

06:21.604 --> 06:21.824
Oh, oh.

06:22.205 --> 06:23.967
There's a college called Coldly College.

06:23.987 --> 06:25.829
Coldly, well, the fellow that testified yesterday.

06:25.889 --> 06:27.932
I never did make it up there, but.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.414
Apparently, they've got a pretty good collection.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.655
I've heard that, yeah.

06:32.818 --> 06:32.918
Yeah.

06:33.472 --> 06:44.926
But I went up to Bowdoin College because there was a man in Minneapolis who was a historical writer that worked for the old Minneapolis Times.

06:45.707 --> 06:55.939
His name was Arthur J. Russell, and he donated his personal materials, but wasn't sold off.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.341
This was at Bowdoin?

06:57.361 --> 06:57.461
Yeah.

06:57.481 --> 06:57.741
What's this?

06:58.615 --> 07:01.438
This is to give you an idea how good a heart Jerry is.

07:01.639 --> 07:21.061
She's known the trouble that I've had, I've went through, I've had a lot of education, and she got these tickets free to American Business Seminar, and she's sending her, me, and her oldest son to this seminar, hoping that we can take this knowledge and do something with it.

07:21.081 --> 07:22.443
That's great, huh?

07:22.463 --> 07:23.644
And these are valued at $125.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.648
Wow, that's something, I see it, baby.

07:27.522 --> 07:28.623
She's a nice woman.

07:29.324 --> 07:33.790
And that's just the kind of people that I associate with.

07:33.810 --> 07:37.695
Yeah, if I'd have lived in Des Moines, I'd have known these people for a while, you know.

07:38.637 --> 07:40.259
I know people just like them in Minneapolis.

07:40.439 --> 07:44.605
You have a sense of rightness to you.

07:45.346 --> 07:47.168
You have a moral.

07:48.127 --> 07:50.210
sense, a system of values.

07:50.791 --> 07:52.413
You could talk a little bit to me about that.

07:52.433 --> 07:54.056
I appreciate you thinking that.

07:54.076 --> 07:56.499
Some people think I don't have it anymore.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.322
I see these friends here, these people.

07:58.482 --> 07:59.243
This is evidence.

07:59.263 --> 08:02.228
This is very compelling, persuasive.

08:04.090 --> 08:12.583
Yeah, I'm so happy that you can take the time and hear my side of it because everybody's heard the government's side of it.

08:12.603 --> 08:13.945
And they're not going to get to hear yours.

08:14.045 --> 08:14.826
Yeah, and that's

08:15.768 --> 08:18.433
Mine is going to reach a lot more people.

08:18.593 --> 08:22.842
Yeah, that's not... The government's version isn't moral.

08:23.783 --> 08:28.753
It doesn't... I always was interested, for instance, in the Confederate States.

08:28.873 --> 08:36.207
I had a Civil War collection of either Copperhead or pro-Confederate stuff because...

08:36.355 --> 08:37.496
This is printed material?

08:37.857 --> 08:39.459
Printed material, yeah.

08:39.479 --> 08:41.081
Is this in the collection?

08:41.101 --> 08:43.624
Yeah, I was especially interested in Van Every Horton.

08:43.644 --> 08:47.148
He was the major copperhead publisher in New York City.

08:47.448 --> 08:48.670
H-O-R-T-O-N?

08:49.411 --> 08:51.353
Yeah, yeah.

08:52.975 --> 08:53.676
Van Everett.

08:54.217 --> 08:54.777
Is that the name?

08:54.797 --> 08:55.318
Van Every.

08:55.698 --> 08:58.582
E-V-E-R-I-E.

08:59.223 --> 09:05.350
Because I felt, and you read post-Civil War accounts of the war,

09:05.752 --> 09:35.607
there was a message and a lesson that was lost in the confederacy and uh while they preserved the union but the country never was the same afterwards and what we lost was the state's rights thing you know and the civil war even today is still a wound that hasn't been settled the the the southerners never

09:36.295 --> 10:05.762
developed the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the northerners and their pride like in small southern towns are still the battles fought in those towns and the things done in that era that is what they identify with and we lost something in the Civil War and that's preserved in the memoirs and the accounts and the family

10:06.451 --> 10:21.333
things that are passed down from generation to generation in, you know, verbally and so forth in the people of the South or the publications of the South.

10:21.353 --> 10:28.964
They, for instance, there were a lot of slaves that when they were freed, they wanted to stay with their masters simply because that was their home.

10:30.306 --> 10:34.973
Slavery, you know, there was a, I wished I could quote the Senate

10:35.678 --> 10:49.198
version and all that, but it was debated and it was agreed upon that by 1885 the Southerners would free the slaves.

10:49.432 --> 10:53.337
simply because they were finding it was uneconomical to have them.

10:53.377 --> 10:58.042
H. L. Macon suggested that we shouldn't really, that the war wasn't necessary.

10:58.083 --> 10:58.944
No, no, it wasn't.

10:58.964 --> 10:59.484
Absolutely.

10:59.524 --> 11:06.232
Because we were the last major country to get rid of slavery and world pressure would have been such that it would have been necessary.

11:06.293 --> 11:10.097
And today we got the blacks have economic slavery to the government anyhow.

11:10.758 --> 11:13.802
What are they, you know, what's happened to most of them now?

11:13.822 --> 11:17.346
You know, they, it's just like Jerry talks about if you try to,

11:17.950 --> 11:24.417
If you're on welfare and you try to sell something or you try to make a little extra money for yourself, they'll kick you off.

11:24.437 --> 11:34.129
Most of the blacks today are slaves economically anyhow, but they don't have the personal identification they had back then.

11:34.529 --> 11:45.021
Although the only thing that was bad about them is with the cruel, which was in the minority, and I base that on my readings of contemporary stuff,

11:45.625 --> 11:52.645
some of them didn't have the freedom to get away from the cruel master, so to speak.

11:52.665 --> 11:55.894
But a lot of them, they were part of the family, and they didn't want to.

11:55.914 --> 11:58.622
And when they were freed, what happened at the South

11:59.007 --> 12:01.810
Or did the North economically try to help them?

12:01.850 --> 12:04.773
No, a lot of them just starved to death and died of disease.

12:05.173 --> 12:06.294
They had no place to go.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.355
And where did they stay?

12:07.415 --> 12:14.402
They stayed in the South until, economically, during the wars, they could come north during World War I and World War II.

12:14.923 --> 12:23.471
Because, by and large, the black, northern American Negro was an unknown phenomenon until World War II.

12:23.491 --> 12:25.453
It was running down where we are.

12:25.771 --> 12:26.792
Oskaloosa.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.916
He was an Indian chief or something.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.620
It's a nice name.

12:33.640 --> 12:43.692
I used to have... Oh, you did, huh?

12:43.712 --> 12:50.340
The nickname they call this, the 21st century nickname is Oski.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.303
I'll show you an interesting building.

12:52.323 --> 12:54.225
You know, there was an old Jewish

12:55.640 --> 13:05.154
A group of people, our family immigrated over and they came way to Davenport and then went up to the Twin Cities in the late 19th century or mid 19th century.

13:05.955 --> 13:11.743
And they came over with this group of German Jews that immigrated to Southeast Iowa.

13:12.284 --> 13:19.354
And there was a very prominent member of that ethnic fraternity, religious fraternity here, his name was Frankel.

13:19.374 --> 13:25.022
And he had a dry goods company and it's right in the next block on our right and it's called the Frankel block.

13:26.032 --> 13:28.756
And I'll show you the Frankel block when we go by.

13:29.156 --> 13:34.203
Now, you had mentioned to me that you have a distant relation to Dr. Rosenbach.

13:34.423 --> 13:35.404
Yeah.

13:35.444 --> 13:37.828
Well, you see the Frankel block, right?

13:38.148 --> 13:40.171
There's stained glass transoms.

13:40.191 --> 13:40.872
Oh, yeah.

13:41.032 --> 13:43.816
And he was a Jewish merchant here in southeast Iowa.

13:43.836 --> 13:45.558
Which must have been pretty unusual.

13:45.578 --> 13:49.764
Yeah, yeah.

13:49.784 --> 13:51.326
With stained glass transoms.

13:51.346 --> 13:51.946
Yeah.

13:51.966 --> 13:52.487
Are they nice?

13:53.308 --> 13:54.209
Yeah, they're pretty nice.

13:54.290 --> 13:55.431
They were built in the 1880s.

13:55.765 --> 13:58.528
You want to eat in Bill and Surf's Cafe there?

13:58.588 --> 14:03.575
That's a good mom, pa, and a nice old lady in there that'll cook for you and say hi to you.

14:03.595 --> 14:07.800
And I used to eat there before my demise.

14:10.363 --> 14:11.805
I hope it's open.

14:11.925 --> 14:14.087
Uh-oh.

14:14.968 --> 14:15.970
Yeah, it's open.

14:15.990 --> 14:16.230
Come on in.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.071
We'll get something to eat.

14:17.812 --> 14:20.355
It's a lot more wholesome than... Okay, we'll shut down now.

14:20.892 --> 14:24.437
No one ever knowing about what you actually had.

14:24.477 --> 14:28.042
Specifically, the ultimate thing would be, it's not the whole sentence.

14:29.464 --> 14:43.865
I suppose the ultimate thing would be, for me, would be if I could somehow repair the mistrust through my bad judgment I've created in the academic community.

14:44.345 --> 14:50.494
And then to get recognition of the potential

14:51.132 --> 15:06.511
that I could contribute and to be able, let's say, to have open access to various depositories of knowledge that myself I could learn and I could take people like Adam in if they get curious on something that they could learn.

15:06.571 --> 15:08.674
You know?

15:11.077 --> 15:19.587
Because I had, you know, it was funny, in school I either got excellent grades or

15:19.803 --> 15:25.091
failing grades, and most of it was due to the attitude of the teacher.

15:25.251 --> 15:38.211
I, for instance, got an F in American history in the 10th grade, and I didn't know what I'd do now, but I knew and was interested in American history, but I had a personality clash with the teacher.

15:38.852 --> 15:41.275
Well, Adam here has the same problem at school.

15:41.355 --> 15:47.785
Adam has interests in things that I think the way to teach is to bring out somebody's

15:48.811 --> 16:16.573
Interest if they have a latent interest in something and work on that in context to everything else you see And sometimes educators in a public sense seem to overlook that and they if they seem to have a problem communicating or whatever they just shuck off the difficult Like myself and Adam see I identify myself with Adam because I was sort of in his

16:17.330 --> 16:20.816
spot as a youth, you know.

16:20.836 --> 16:33.496
But I put myself into collecting and preserving things, and that sort of became my life, and I don't know what else life to be, you know.

16:34.237 --> 16:36.481
Can you imagine these people like that?

16:36.881 --> 16:40.367
They're people in all economic stratas that

16:41.613 --> 16:50.258
If they just could find somebody that knew, like there's probably somebody in this town that would like to know the history of that Frankl block.

16:51.341 --> 16:54.390
And maybe nobody in Oskaloosa even knows.

16:54.860 --> 17:19.281
about it you know but maybe out there there's somebody that want to know about it sure yeah and i've done this all over the country i can tell you about amarillo texas all along these routes i used to take that someday we ought to take a trip together

17:20.037 --> 17:21.659
Say again, you can never betray a trust.

17:21.679 --> 17:23.242
I can never betray a trust.

17:23.262 --> 17:38.244
If, for instance, I were given a couch and the keys to the Library of Congress, I'd go around and make sure all the windows were locked and lock the door after I left.

17:38.685 --> 17:41.269
I probably, if I were entrusted,

17:41.958 --> 17:45.502
to the Library of Congress.

17:45.622 --> 17:48.246
Everybody walked out and said, Steve, you can live here.

17:49.227 --> 17:55.895
And I were given that position of trust.

17:55.915 --> 18:03.864
I'd probably find more purses that had been left by patrons and get them returned than otherwise would be.

18:03.884 --> 18:06.948
When somebody gives you their trust, then you can't betray them.

18:07.048 --> 18:07.729
I never could.

18:09.650 --> 18:10.853
I didn't fall over that lie.

18:10.873 --> 18:12.115
You know what I'm reading?

18:12.436 --> 18:15.783
You know.

18:15.863 --> 18:23.821
Once you personally accept an extension of trust, you respect it.

18:24.382 --> 18:29.633
Yeah, if they'd like to say, they gave me the keys to the Library of Congress and said, you can live here.

18:30.052 --> 18:50.878
you have an apartment here yeah would you do that if they said it yeah i'd probably make notes on things and say hey you can inventory this better do that better i couldn't

18:51.753 --> 19:04.628
I mean, a lot of librarians, all they do is just check books out.

19:07.611 --> 19:15.600
I mean, they don't have the knowledge to do that.

19:15.901 --> 19:16.943
Right here, honey.

19:16.963 --> 19:19.707
They tell you to go look in the index file, you know.

19:19.727 --> 19:19.907
Mm-hmm.

19:19.927 --> 19:22.991
They tell you to walk over and pull the book right out and say, here you go.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.837
Did you know where all your books were in the house?

19:26.857 --> 19:27.037
Yeah.

19:27.057 --> 19:30.002
Did you know where you could put your hands on them?

19:30.022 --> 19:30.202
Oh, yeah.

19:30.222 --> 19:30.322
Yeah.

19:30.342 --> 19:33.647
They were talking about the Charles T. Wells collection in Hartford.

19:33.707 --> 19:37.012
I imagine he was Hartford's premier.

19:37.232 --> 19:38.014
Hartford, Connecticut.

19:38.054 --> 19:41.699
I imagine he was Hartford's premier of Biblophile of the late 90s.

19:41.739 --> 19:43.402
How was it?

19:43.542 --> 19:45.064
Had an exceptional collection of books.

19:45.719 --> 19:46.541
Americana.

19:46.581 --> 19:48.606
I think he bought most of it from Todd and Meade.

19:48.666 --> 19:50.871
They were early.

19:50.891 --> 19:52.174
Yeah.

19:52.214 --> 19:57.426
Well, they had an antiquarian book department there.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.007
Facilities.

19:58.067 --> 19:58.789
Robert Clark.

19:58.889 --> 20:02.277
That's the antiquarian collector and publisher in Cincinnati.

20:02.297 --> 20:03.660
Robert Clark.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.511
That's the name.

20:05.531 --> 20:06.973
He was Cincinnati.

20:07.053 --> 20:18.811
He and Peter Thompson, who wrote the bibliography of Ohio back in 1883, they were Cincinnati's premier bibliophiles and writers of the 19th century.

20:18.971 --> 20:32.230
As far as book collecting and republishing American history, Daniel Drake was probably... Daniel Drake and Charles Sisk were probably Cincinnati's foremost...

20:32.885 --> 20:38.111
You know a guy I always liked was Nicholas Longworth from Cincinnati.

20:41.374 --> 20:45.239
Nicholas Longworth, L-O-N-G-W-O-R-T-H.

20:46.380 --> 20:51.666
He, in about 1850 or just before the Civil War, was Cincinnati's wealthiest citizen.

20:52.326 --> 20:56.631
He owned all of Mount Adams, which is part of downtown Cincinnati now.

20:56.898 --> 20:58.500
and a lot of things around there.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.562
You know how he made his money?

20:59.582 --> 21:03.888
He made it buying land, of course, and in grape culture.

21:03.908 --> 21:08.275
In fact, he perfected the process of breeding the Catawba grape.

21:08.495 --> 21:13.803
He had grape barbers and a winery in Cincinnati.

21:14.223 --> 21:16.627
Well, you know, there was a story about Longworth.

21:16.807 --> 21:22.095
I read an old, old book, and it was his views of the poor.

21:22.649 --> 21:45.703
of what poor people one and longworth sort of dressed in old raggedy clothes one day he was asleep next to a rock sitting uh you know next to a bush or something he had his hat off he was sleeping with his head on this rock and somebody who didn't know who he was came and put a penny in his hat

21:46.240 --> 22:10.813
and somebody who knew who he was saw it so when mr longworth awoke now this is the wealthiest man in cincinnati in 1850. when nichols longworth awoke the man said you know you've done you could do a lot of good for people here in cincinnati and latin he said how can you take charity

22:11.452 --> 22:12.553
from somebody.

22:12.654 --> 22:14.316
Aren't you ashamed of yourself for that?

22:14.336 --> 22:16.319
Of course, he didn't solicit the charity.

22:16.679 --> 22:20.544
Why don't you spruce yourself up and live according to your means?

22:20.564 --> 22:29.917
And why do you help some of the people you do like prostitutes or people that they thought were disreputable?

22:29.937 --> 22:34.523
And Longworth said, well, a widow with children and that

22:34.604 --> 22:52.251
You'll find sympathy through anybody, but I try to help out the people nobody else likes or people have contempt for, because he'd give sums of money to individuals that people in this town would think would be disreputable.

22:52.271 --> 22:55.035
They'd say, well, why don't you give it to the church or give it to this?

22:55.055 --> 22:59.662
He had his own way of thinking, I wouldn't like to have met that guy.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.443
How do you develop this stuff?

23:02.532 --> 23:21.366
Well, my home life was very uncomfortable and very unsettling.

23:21.386 --> 23:25.553
I lived in an exclusive neighborhood and went for a while to private school.

23:25.735 --> 23:26.496
St.

23:26.817 --> 23:28.840
Thomas Military Academy in St.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.225
Paul, for instance.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.747
Did you graduate from that?

23:33.767 --> 23:33.827
No.

23:33.847 --> 23:34.809
No, I ran away.

23:37.112 --> 23:44.583
But I wasn't accepted by my own group for what I was, and when I'd get into the city, I started out collecting the Salvation Army.

23:44.643 --> 23:47.828
I had these people in these neighborhoods, and they accepted me.

23:47.848 --> 23:54.578
And then in reform school, when I went to reform school, I wasn't beaten up in reform school because I was a small, rich kid.

23:55.098 --> 23:56.259
I got on with those guys.

23:56.279 --> 23:58.361
I had all kinds of friends before I'm screening.

23:58.441 --> 24:05.969
In fact, during adolescence, that was my first group of peers, people my own age that were my friends.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.510
And what were you even responsible for?

24:07.530 --> 24:15.558
For not going to school or running away from home because my mother was so terrible and mean and my home life was so bad.

24:15.799 --> 24:20.143
Were you abused in any way, physically?

24:20.967 --> 24:25.574
Of course, she used to burn my stuff, and she was worse to my father.

24:25.594 --> 24:32.604
She used to burn his clothes and stuff, but she'd say the most insulting, rottenest, meanest things.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.048
I feel sorry for her now, her rage.

24:35.468 --> 24:36.190
Is she alive?

24:36.210 --> 24:37.892
Yeah, she's alive, but she's broken.

24:38.373 --> 24:47.346
You know, she just sort of became aid up with her aggression, you know, so.

24:48.625 --> 25:01.020
So I, you know, I'd leave home or leave school and wander around in the vacant houses in the urban and rural areas in the Salvation Army and pick up stuff and pick up with the people in the area.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.962
I always had a few bucks, you know.

25:02.982 --> 25:04.984
That's why you say that I feel threatened.

25:05.625 --> 25:06.146
Not really.

25:06.286 --> 25:10.831
I lived in the worst neighborhoods in Minneapolis, yet people wouldn't bother me.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.453
They knew I was good people.

25:12.493 --> 25:13.895
That wasn't my question.

25:13.915 --> 25:16.658
When I asked about that, it was when you were in the libraries.

25:16.992 --> 25:38.513
Stephen, you ever think you'd want to be a teacher?

25:39.674 --> 25:41.856
Yeah, I would, but I don't know.

25:41.876 --> 25:43.678
I wouldn't want to just sit in the classroom.

25:43.698 --> 25:46.240
I like, you know, your best lessons

25:46.912 --> 25:47.713
are seeing it.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.778
I've taken guys... This is very interesting.

25:51.798 --> 25:53.500
Isn't that neat, that Italian ink?

25:53.620 --> 25:54.601
It really is, yeah.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.263
And you know, look at that.

25:56.283 --> 25:57.084
That looks like a St.

25:57.104 --> 26:00.248
Paul art glass company window with a beveled diamond in the center.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.349
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it, huh?

26:02.290 --> 26:07.016
You know, your Victorian architecture varies from region to region in the country.

26:07.076 --> 26:11.621
Like, the New England stuff has a different feel than the stuff in Iowa.

26:11.661 --> 26:13.223
Look at that one with the arches.

26:16.139 --> 26:22.026
And, well, back to the teaching thing, yeah, I would, but I kind of would like to be a teacher like Socrates.

26:22.086 --> 26:25.110
He just went around and taught as he observed, you know.

26:25.791 --> 26:26.612
That's the ultimate.

26:27.473 --> 26:28.114
Instructed.

26:28.314 --> 26:29.295
Yeah, instructed.

26:30.597 --> 26:32.680
Sort of like a field trip teacher.

26:33.521 --> 26:33.661
Yeah.

26:33.681 --> 26:35.203
I took, like, a couple of guys.

26:35.904 --> 26:37.205
Oh, they're a little older than that.

26:37.325 --> 26:38.026
Look at that garden.

26:38.186 --> 26:39.728
That's a beautiful little house there, isn't it?

26:39.748 --> 26:43.513
I'd like to teach people your knowledge, and then also, while you're learning,

26:44.185 --> 26:46.929
you know, get, feel the excitement of their learning.

26:46.949 --> 26:47.309
Oh, yeah.

26:47.630 --> 26:47.910
Yeah.

26:48.211 --> 26:54.239
Well, I can learn from them, you know, like if I took you two guys to Minneapolis, I'd ask you, what do you see?

26:54.299 --> 26:55.701
Because I've seen it all my life.

26:56.562 --> 26:59.807
We'd give you a different view, and it would give you a whole different view.

26:59.827 --> 27:07.498
I took a young fellow from Ottumwa up there, and we got over the hill, and he'd never been in the city.

27:08.499 --> 27:12.825
And all of a sudden, the interstate got about eight lanes wide, and there were

27:13.177 --> 27:41.378
all this traffic, you know, big city traffic, and he was just, like, scared and all that, and I had another fellow with me who was from Minneapolis, and we got to 494 and 35W, or in the Crosstown area, and there's a big office park development in there, and the skyline of skyscrapers there is as big as Des Moines, you know, there's 34, 40-story office buildings in the South Town Office Plaza, you know, and there's a lot of buildings,

27:41.780 --> 27:47.508
So I says to this Carl Thrasher, I said, Carl, Minneapolis is a big city, isn't it?

27:47.988 --> 27:50.251
I says, look at how big those buildings are there.

27:50.652 --> 27:55.078
And he says, yeah, that's almost as big as downtown Des Moines.

27:55.098 --> 27:57.641
And I says, we're still five miles out, you know.

27:58.683 --> 28:05.492
And he just, the things he would say about the city, the way the houses were, the way the people were, the traffic and that,

28:05.962 --> 28:06.863
He mentioned things.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.464
I never thought of it that way.

28:08.544 --> 28:10.586
I just had seen that all my life.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.548
So I learned from his observations.

28:14.370 --> 28:15.471
Things I didn't realize.

28:15.491 --> 28:16.131
You're a young man.

28:16.151 --> 28:16.511
You're 42.

28:18.473 --> 28:19.654
Five years younger than I am.

28:20.475 --> 28:26.280
However this thing comes out, you're going to still be a young man when it's all over.

28:27.762 --> 28:28.943
Regardless.

28:28.963 --> 28:30.744
You've still got a lot of your life left.

28:31.425 --> 28:33.927
How do you think you'd like to spend it?

28:35.122 --> 28:36.204
Gosh, I don't know.

28:36.705 --> 28:39.810
I'd like to do what I was doing, you know?

28:40.451 --> 28:41.734
I'll be a little more specific.

28:42.695 --> 28:51.992
Oh, traveling and buying and selling antiques, but yet I put in a lot of work in a way.

28:52.032 --> 28:53.534
I hate being just a merchant.

28:55.558 --> 28:59.104
See, when I'd sell these architectural things to people, I wouldn't

28:59.573 --> 29:09.367
I always enjoy selling it to somebody redoing an old home or whatever because I could see it go in use, like sash locks.

29:09.387 --> 29:18.100
I would just love a guy redoing an old house that would come in and want his house authentic down even to the sash handles.

29:18.280 --> 29:21.745
I used to save those, you know, down to the minute.

29:21.765 --> 29:25.450
Now, is it true that somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 doorknob?

29:25.470 --> 29:29.496
Yeah, I belong to the National Doorknob Collectors Club, and I

29:29.695 --> 29:57.880
uh most of the major collections in the country i've sort of contributed stuff to and i've known i knew the founders and i was in on it from the beginning what is the significance of the doorknob well i think its major significance is to preserve beyond its function exactly well to preserve its its function really is a club and to compare each other's no i mean beyond the function i'm talking just fundamentally about the doorknob

29:58.265 --> 29:59.046
Not the club.

29:59.066 --> 30:00.568
Oh, the significance of the doorknobs?

30:00.588 --> 30:00.988
Yeah.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.190
Well, they were an art form.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.493
They have all these beautiful patterns.

30:04.593 --> 30:12.663
And like they used to do courthouses, and the architects would put the city seal in it or the state seal.

30:12.723 --> 30:24.717
And years ago, you could have a building you're building with your, even the knob custom made with your initial in it.

30:25.498 --> 30:27.040
And that all went out.

30:27.948 --> 30:30.492
by the time of World War I or the Depression.

30:30.512 --> 30:35.279
So what is the focus in terms of the periods of the collection?

30:35.860 --> 30:36.461
Give me the years.

30:36.641 --> 30:45.474
Well, okay, the first emblematic knob was designed by Cruxinger and was made in Boston by the Metallic Compression Casting Company.

30:46.536 --> 30:49.180
And it was a patented process of pressing up.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.724
figure in brass or casting it and molding it.

30:52.784 --> 30:59.994
And that was done by Krutzinger, designed by Krutzinger and patented by the Metallica Press and Casting Company in 1869.

31:00.855 --> 31:05.821
So it starts from 1869 to about 1920.

31:05.881 --> 31:08.004
That was it.

31:08.024 --> 31:12.249
Would you say you had one of the most extensive and comprehensive collections in the United States?

31:13.671 --> 31:14.072
Yeah, I did.

31:14.612 --> 31:16.635
Would you say the most or one of the most?

31:17.273 --> 31:19.616
Well, it's up to debate.

31:19.636 --> 31:22.761
Charlie Wardell, for instance, had more store door handles.

31:22.781 --> 31:23.842
And who's Charlie Wardell?

31:23.923 --> 31:25.725
Another major collector.

31:25.745 --> 31:26.146
Does he know you?

31:26.166 --> 31:26.687
Oh, very well.

31:26.727 --> 31:27.488
And where is he out of?

31:28.008 --> 31:29.250
High Point, North Carolina.

31:30.031 --> 31:35.980
Lee and Jim Kaiser had a more extensive collection of pressed glass knobs.

31:36.040 --> 31:37.782
His collection was stronger than that.

31:38.383 --> 31:41.688
But I suppose in the brass decorative knobs.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.592
A quad-county grain ink.

31:44.692 --> 31:46.375
These are big silos, right?

31:46.455 --> 31:46.555
Yeah.

31:47.665 --> 31:55.315
They worked for Des Moines Lock for approximately almost a year.

31:55.335 --> 31:57.257
And they, the city had brought down.

31:57.277 --> 31:57.558
Thanks, Steve.

31:57.658 --> 31:58.118
Look at that.

31:58.138 --> 32:06.749
Years ago, they had more of that, more of the shops, more of the personal identification.

32:07.811 --> 32:13.478
But your craftsman... Oh, yeah, looks like a chandelier or decanter.

32:13.498 --> 32:15.420
Yeah, that's kind of crystal.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.241
That's my crystal.

32:16.261 --> 32:17.503
I've had it for...

32:17.804 --> 32:37.875
Right now, for six years, given to me from a friend.

32:37.895 --> 32:39.417
And after he gave it to me, he didn't realize what it was he wanted it back.

32:39.437 --> 32:41.661
And I said, well, he gave it to me.

32:41.681 --> 32:42.522
It's mine now, and I've had it ever since.

32:42.542 --> 32:43.103
This is a beautiful country.

32:43.123 --> 32:43.644
Yeah, it's a neat country.

32:43.664 --> 32:44.405
And I can find some distant admirers.

32:44.425 --> 32:45.126
Silos and the folks that are there.

32:45.146 --> 32:45.246
Yeah.

32:46.525 --> 32:51.471
Could you say you were an obsessive collector?

32:51.491 --> 33:00.681
Oh, I collected in a lot of fields, and I really couldn't do enough in each field.

33:00.861 --> 33:04.846
I should have done more with doorknobs, or more with windows, or more with books.

33:05.126 --> 33:14.997
I could see my limitations, and maybe I could have missed out on other aspects of life that were given.

33:15.989 --> 33:21.800
different rewards or different satisfactions to myself or other people.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.065
But some people say I am, but I don't.

33:24.125 --> 33:25.227
I enjoyed collecting.

33:25.287 --> 33:27.471
And it was a livelihood.

33:27.511 --> 33:33.964
Who gets to have their work and their livelihood be their enjoyment?

33:34.535 --> 33:37.099
How extensive was your stained glass window?

33:37.339 --> 33:40.463
Oh, I had about 500 windows.

33:41.405 --> 33:46.712
And I was trying to categorize them by examples of studios around the country.

33:46.732 --> 33:48.194
That'd be another good project.

33:48.214 --> 33:55.885
I worked with a guy named H. Webb Wilson, who's an art class dealer out on the East Coast and a consultant to the

33:56.472 --> 33:58.735
Smithsonian on American art glass.

33:59.096 --> 34:03.902
There's very little research that's been done on American art glass studios of the 19th century.

34:03.942 --> 34:12.174
They haven't been chronicled, or their designs, or their artisans, or their glasswork hasn't really been chronicled or exhibited very much.

34:12.194 --> 34:16.800
And he's the only guy I know that's done any research on that.

34:16.860 --> 34:19.083
And I had been doing that, too.

34:19.103 --> 34:20.285
And he wrote a book on it.

34:20.305 --> 34:23.509
It's the only book that I know it's ever written.

34:23.928 --> 34:29.495
As far as being obsessive, I wasn't thought to be by the people in the fields.

34:29.535 --> 34:32.618
Like, Wilson didn't think I was obsessive with our class.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.884
Kaiser didn't think I was obsessive with doorknobs.

34:38.885 --> 34:43.431
Book people didn't think I was with books, but they never could understand the other aspects of collecting.

34:43.451 --> 34:44.252
They'd say, what do you say?

34:44.552 --> 34:45.193
Doorknobs.

34:45.213 --> 34:48.737
I think everybody I know, everybody I've interviewed for this project,

34:50.135 --> 34:50.998
It's obsessed.

34:51.018 --> 34:51.319
Oh, yeah.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.503
We're collectors, you know.

34:52.583 --> 34:57.458
I think we, quite frankly, cheerfully admitted as part of our fabric.

34:57.599 --> 35:00.448
You know, I mean, Ray Cornell said yesterday,

35:00.850 --> 35:08.099
When they started showing at Nuremberg Chronicle, I got physically excited.

35:08.599 --> 35:09.801
I mean, I really did.

35:09.821 --> 35:11.523
I said, oh, it's wonderful.

35:11.623 --> 35:13.886
And I started asking questions about the binding.

35:14.086 --> 35:17.530
Apparently, it's the original embossed path binding.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.973
That's the original binding, which is quite extraordinary.

35:19.993 --> 35:20.453
What's that?

35:20.734 --> 35:21.755
The Nuremberg Chronicle.

35:21.775 --> 35:22.656
Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:22.636 --> 35:24.017
That's an original binding.

35:24.037 --> 35:24.958
I don't think it is.

35:25.018 --> 35:27.501
I think it's 18th century.

35:27.601 --> 35:30.945
Yeah, it just doesn't look like a 500-year-old binding.

35:30.965 --> 35:31.225
No, no.

35:31.245 --> 35:34.989
I was astonished when she said she thought it was... I don't think it is.

35:35.009 --> 35:43.297
It's a very good binding of this period, but it is... And the clasps, you know, kind of... And the tooling, it's later, I think.

35:43.317 --> 35:48.183
Yeah, it just didn't look... I mean, I've seen 500-year-old bindings that don't hold up that well.

35:48.243 --> 35:48.643
Yeah.

35:49.265 --> 35:50.687
That's on paper, too.

35:50.707 --> 35:54.253
That's not, I mean, that's a paper text.

35:54.273 --> 35:55.154
It's not a vellum text.

35:55.174 --> 35:56.156
No, it's vellum.

35:56.216 --> 35:57.578
It is vellum.

35:57.598 --> 35:57.959
Yeah, it's vellum.

35:57.979 --> 35:58.620
Very well preserved.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.284
There's a little foxing on it, though.

36:01.304 --> 36:01.905
On the pages?

36:02.846 --> 36:05.811
Well, the pages are paper, but... That's what I meant, yeah.

36:05.971 --> 36:08.235
Oh, I thought you meant the cover itself.

36:08.255 --> 36:10.238
She said, I asked her if... No, no.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.181
Oh, the book wasn't printed on vellum.

36:12.201 --> 36:14.665
The book is printed on paper because it was foxing.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.711
The binding, I thought, was vellum.

36:18.272 --> 36:18.853
It is, yeah.

36:18.873 --> 36:20.256
And she said, it's not vellum.

36:20.316 --> 36:21.178
It's calfskin.

36:21.498 --> 36:22.200
I asked the woman.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.482
No, it's vellum.

36:23.502 --> 36:23.843
It's white.

36:24.023 --> 36:24.805
Calfskin is.

36:24.985 --> 36:29.494
I said, I went up to her after her testimony, and I asked her some questions about the book.

36:29.514 --> 36:29.694
Yeah.

36:30.095 --> 36:32.199
And she said, oh, no, it's not vellum.

36:32.279 --> 36:33.682
It's embossed calfskin.

36:34.123 --> 36:36.147
Calfskin peels.

36:36.167 --> 36:37.429
It gets like that red.

36:38.253 --> 36:39.274
raw thin.

36:39.294 --> 36:43.739
It'll leave something on your hand unless it's oiled, where Bellum will split.

36:43.759 --> 36:45.301
And that thing, you can just feel it.

36:45.401 --> 36:47.863
It looked like Bellum to me.

36:47.883 --> 36:50.046
I was astonished that she would have said there was something to do.

36:50.066 --> 36:55.311
Well, so much for your experts and professionals.

36:56.512 --> 37:02.038
What would you say were your most prized possessions in the book collection?

37:02.118 --> 37:04.581
What did you enjoy owning most?

37:05.506 --> 37:15.035
Well, my Victorian trade catalogs and my view books on American cities.

37:16.357 --> 37:16.857
View books?

37:17.178 --> 37:18.279
Yeah.

37:18.339 --> 37:21.402
For the sake of my type, it's V-I-E-W.

37:21.422 --> 37:24.064
And then I suppose I did like those.

37:24.625 --> 37:31.111
Well, I suppose my regional histories, because I could read them and get things out.

37:31.131 --> 37:32.813
And then I suppose for the

37:34.227 --> 38:00.167
books themselves the incunables and how did you enjoy them did you take them down and well i i looked at i enjoyed sharing them with guys like adam and explaining what uh uh what it was now who did you have down here in it somewhere to give me an instance of somebody you might bring in and how they would enjoy the collection with you oh david olson

38:01.008 --> 38:06.977
or Billy Lockway, or Norman Crowe.

38:07.017 --> 38:09.180
He's an antique dealer.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.826
There were a lot of people, or quite a number of people in Ottumwa, that saw the books.

38:12.846 --> 38:21.538
I didn't make any effort to conceal them from anybody.

38:21.558 --> 38:28.028
I didn't want people coming in the house when I wasn't there, like bribing Mr. Hall and buying them off of them.

38:29.003 --> 38:31.187
You know, say, oh, I'll give you 50 bucks for this.

38:31.207 --> 38:32.249
Steve won't know.

38:32.990 --> 38:34.673
I didn't want people there when I wasn't there.

38:35.094 --> 38:37.177
Do you think any of that ever happened?

38:37.197 --> 38:38.720
I think it did with Ken Rhodes, yeah.

38:41.144 --> 38:50.060
I think he let FBI agents in there to go through that stuff before the search warrant, and they may very well have stolen some things out of there.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.526
I can't prove that, but I think he let people in there.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.961
Because I read the search warrant.

38:58.981 --> 39:04.328
They knew pretty much what was in there when they wrote up that search warrant.

39:04.488 --> 39:08.554
I think you're absolutely right on that.

39:08.574 --> 39:09.655
What's your general feeling?

39:09.935 --> 39:11.557
How do you feel?

39:11.577 --> 39:11.898
About what?

39:12.058 --> 39:12.919
About everything.

39:12.939 --> 39:14.020
Well, I'm pretty scared.

39:15.883 --> 39:18.987
Everything's scared, but I'm optimistic.

39:19.768 --> 39:21.690
I've met guys like you, you know.

39:22.261 --> 39:27.929
Yeah, there will be sympathetic and knowledgeable people at all, and he has countless notoriety.

39:31.193 --> 39:37.742
Do you appreciate, of course, that, you know, there isn't another case quite like this?

39:39.124 --> 39:39.805
There isn't.

39:39.865 --> 39:42.429
I mean, on the scale.

39:43.450 --> 39:50.480
In terms of what you accomplished, I think, is in a class by itself.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.441
It's quite extraordinary.

39:52.298 --> 39:53.460
He must know that.

39:54.881 --> 39:55.983
He must feel that.

39:56.003 --> 39:58.747
Oh, there was Cardinal Richelieu in France.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.310
That's right.

40:01.330 --> 40:03.273
And... Henry IV.

40:03.293 --> 40:04.915
Yeah, I didn't know about that.

40:05.015 --> 40:06.397
And Madame Pompadour.

40:06.938 --> 40:11.083
In fact, they started the law.

40:11.223 --> 40:14.007
They introduced a law that every publisher had to give the king.

40:14.768 --> 40:15.349
One of the books.

40:15.429 --> 40:16.711
That's why they'd have to buy them.

40:16.731 --> 40:17.692
They got one every one free.

40:17.812 --> 40:18.073
Yeah.

40:18.814 --> 40:21.377
No, I mean people that were...

40:22.927 --> 40:23.949
Berleining books.

40:25.090 --> 40:36.527
The Bibliothèque Nationale in France was started, or endowed in a major capacity by what the Cardinal Richard was.

40:36.547 --> 40:45.280
And he would sort of, when he got caught, he was sort of admonished by the royalty.

40:45.841 --> 40:47.043
Finally, they just gave up.

40:47.063 --> 40:49.947
I think they made him a librarian of it, didn't they?

40:49.967 --> 40:51.229
Just to get him to stop.

40:51.496 --> 40:52.798
It left?

40:52.818 --> 40:54.821
Yeah, I read that somewhere.

40:55.001 --> 40:58.466
I've got to check that out.

40:58.486 --> 41:02.892
When I met Steve, the first thing I asked him, what was it that you collected?

41:03.393 --> 41:20.997
He was talking about the architectural books, and he was saying how he'd have people come in that wanted to restore something, and they had no idea what it looked like back then, so they could bring it back to its natural beauty.

41:21.263 --> 41:33.416
and how that made him happy to know that the people that he gave that knowledge to could go out with that and be able to restore those old buildings and go back to their natural behavior.

41:33.436 --> 41:38.401
Did you get a set of those 12 volumes that they presented, the FBI did?

41:38.562 --> 41:41.204
The 12 volumes, I guess they itemized.

41:41.385 --> 41:47.271
There were 12 volumes that they presented in the court yesterday or the day before.

41:47.825 --> 41:55.172
It was a 12-volume catalog, essentially, a computerized catalog of the books that they removed from a tumble... No, I would like to get a set of those.

41:55.232 --> 41:55.813
Well, I would, too.

41:55.893 --> 41:56.073
I should.

41:56.093 --> 41:59.656
I was wondering, I mean, yeah, that's the catalog of your... Yeah, I should.

42:00.117 --> 42:00.978
Well, wouldn't you think so?

42:00.998 --> 42:02.419
I mean, I'm desperate to get a set of them.

42:02.439 --> 42:04.041
Well, they're not giving me anything.

42:06.083 --> 42:07.504
In fact, that's another thing.

42:09.025 --> 42:13.029
I've got to go over all the books that they've attributed to the other places.

42:13.089 --> 42:15.992
I've got a set from...

42:18.352 --> 42:19.073
Last summer.

42:20.655 --> 42:22.859
And, well, it's going to be on the record now.

42:25.282 --> 42:31.011
Harvard University is getting USC's first edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

42:31.031 --> 42:33.194
How did that happen?

42:33.214 --> 42:35.457
Well, somebody screwed up.

42:36.158 --> 42:39.002
And I found a number of disparities in that.

42:39.964 --> 42:41.246
You know that it's USC's.

42:42.367 --> 42:43.569
Yeah, he's nodding his head yes.

42:44.611 --> 42:46.373
So I got to go over it all.

42:47.114 --> 42:47.515
Yeah.

42:47.933 --> 42:51.117
I'm really the only one that can straighten this out.

42:53.299 --> 42:54.320
What they find out.

42:54.340 --> 42:55.641
What makes you so sure that?

42:56.763 --> 42:58.965
Well, only by this catalog.

42:59.025 --> 42:59.806
I'd have to show you.

42:59.826 --> 43:01.007
Nickerson's got the catalog.

43:01.027 --> 43:02.169
How many Uncle Toms did you have?

43:03.350 --> 43:04.351
Maybe there were two.

43:04.711 --> 43:07.695
No, I had one and a partial of another one.

43:07.715 --> 43:08.215
I've got one.

43:08.416 --> 43:09.697
Is this the two volume?

43:09.717 --> 43:11.499
It's the two volume, 1852 Boston.

43:11.739 --> 43:13.421
It's got to have that point of the title.

43:13.481 --> 43:15.223
Yeah, I know about those.

43:16.807 --> 43:43.472
Is that right? So that actually belongs? Well um you see they have a list of items verified, and then they have a total master list, and then the items verified of the July list. That's USC, also... When this is over, all right, do you mind if I tell this to somebody? If you don't want me to I won't. I don't want to betray your confidence in any way but after there's a verdict? Okay? Well I'd have to

43:44.009 --> 44:11.586
double check it and see that's in July but there there's some people. I would just say that there's a possibility it would be good if you checked it again, something like that. Well they haven't given me any additional updated stuff to check. How many of these instances of things like this did you see? Oh I'd have to look at the book in case there were multiple copies but four or five instances of that a major rarity is going to the wrong institution

44:12.882 --> 44:14.504
You can't think of any other roughhands.

44:14.524 --> 44:16.647
Well, I can, but I'll maybe.

44:17.608 --> 44:18.309
Come on, come on for me.

44:18.369 --> 44:19.271
No, I'll wait.

44:20.172 --> 44:22.335
I need some bargaining chips, you know.

44:22.395 --> 44:24.037
I agree with you.

44:24.057 --> 44:31.407
I want to, it'd be nice if they'd make me serve my term as community service or something where I could.

44:31.427 --> 44:36.094
Just help them out with it.

44:36.114 --> 44:36.314
Yeah.

44:36.334 --> 44:37.135
I hate having,

44:37.672 --> 44:42.797
sitting around with guys in the Polk County Jail talking about Point's Uncle Tom's cabin.

44:42.817 --> 44:50.385
They'll listen and they'll learn, but there are better places to... That knowledge can be used more productively.

44:50.405 --> 44:50.525
Yeah.

44:51.446 --> 44:55.230
You might... I'm going to shut this up.

44:55.250 --> 44:57.072
...back with the academic community.

44:57.092 --> 44:59.915
This is kind of what I was asking in a roundabout way.

45:00.055 --> 45:04.120
I mean, when I said that this case is really in a class by itself.

45:04.180 --> 45:07.223
But that isn't the major factor to get my...

45:08.806 --> 45:12.650
Standing back in the academic community, that's a selfish motive.

45:12.670 --> 45:14.893
I owe it to them.

45:14.913 --> 45:17.135
At this point, I've screwed up.

45:17.216 --> 45:20.659
I could have collected doorknobs or stuff out of buildings being torn out.

45:20.679 --> 45:25.305
What would you like to say to the academic community?

45:25.365 --> 45:27.067
I'm at a loss for words, really.

45:27.087 --> 45:28.028
I don't know what to say.

45:28.048 --> 45:31.612
I mean, how did you feel yesterday when you saw this process?

45:31.632 --> 45:34.936
Oh, I felt terrible personally for those people.

45:35.396 --> 45:36.197
When I seen it,

45:36.548 --> 45:38.150
From a person to person.

45:38.590 --> 45:41.053
When I looked those people in the face, I was ashamed.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.414
Really?

45:42.434 --> 45:44.276
Did any of them look at you in the eyes?

45:44.937 --> 45:46.299
Did you establish eye contact?

45:46.439 --> 45:48.821
Yeah, some, but most of them were afraid to look at me.

45:48.841 --> 45:51.164
I didn't want to have anybody afraid of me.

45:51.424 --> 45:52.105
How about Magoo?

45:52.766 --> 45:56.069
Oh, I wanted to shake his hand, and he wouldn't.

45:56.089 --> 45:59.233
You might have known the similarities.

46:00.954 --> 46:02.456
He looked a lot like you.

46:02.516 --> 46:03.417
I was amazed.

46:05.067 --> 46:06.048
Go ahead.

46:06.288 --> 46:13.876
The similarities and what the consequences were to him personally, he looked like he'd been agonized, because he'd been bum-wrapped.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.038
I would have never done that to him, you know?

46:16.058 --> 46:17.199
But I didn't deliver any.

46:17.279 --> 46:18.541
I found the damn thing.

46:19.021 --> 46:22.805
Was this more like the military people call a target of opportunity?

46:22.865 --> 46:25.788
I mean, it was just something that presented itself.

46:25.808 --> 46:31.914
Just as I was walking by a public area, it was laying on a counter.

46:32.114 --> 46:32.454
Really?

46:32.635 --> 46:33.015
Yeah.

46:34.396 --> 46:40.824
That did enable you to enter the next level of collectible, didn't it?

46:40.845 --> 46:40.945
Yeah.

46:40.965 --> 46:41.646
Is that right?

46:41.826 --> 46:43.408
Yeah.

46:43.688 --> 47:00.551
And I guess the thing that got me in the best was when I go in and talk to librarians and these restricted things, they would automatically assume I was who I was by the knowledge that I had, you know.

47:00.571 --> 47:01.652
Were you ever turned down?

47:07.927 --> 47:09.349
No, I never was.

47:12.253 --> 47:12.634
Never was.

47:12.694 --> 47:23.589
Were the methods as described by the various witnesses, were they essentially correct ways that you did manage to gain access?

47:23.609 --> 47:27.655
Pretty much, but most of it wasn't a matter of poor security.

47:27.675 --> 47:29.197
It was a matter of opportunity.

47:31.821 --> 47:33.343
Some of it security, but...

47:34.285 --> 47:39.691
I mean, did things go out the windows the way they described it?

47:39.831 --> 47:41.513
Well, I don't know.

47:41.774 --> 47:50.123
I could go through any institution, and if one way wasn't amenable, I could find three or four other ways.

47:53.267 --> 47:53.507
Wow.

47:55.049 --> 47:57.392
And you never get scared while you were doing this?

47:57.412 --> 48:02.858
No, for instance, why don't we keep this off the record?

48:03.277 --> 48:06.580
I'm sorry, you said you're pretty ingenious of resources.

48:06.681 --> 48:08.362
Now, the machine's on.

48:08.422 --> 48:09.804
I'm not going to deceive you.

48:11.506 --> 48:15.930
Well, I'm ingenious with resources, you know.

48:16.291 --> 48:22.097
Tell me about, what were you going to say about that institution, that Ivy League institution?

48:22.117 --> 48:27.302
Well, I may need that as a marketing head in the future.

48:27.482 --> 48:29.925
And I almost have to go there.

48:31.576 --> 48:37.903
One time I almost got killed in a book dump wader crawling up that to get to the... What was this?

48:39.084 --> 48:40.105
Out in California.

48:41.006 --> 48:45.410
Wait, do you remember that?

48:45.430 --> 48:45.891
Well... Okay.

48:45.911 --> 48:46.692
Tell me what happened.

48:46.712 --> 48:55.661
Well, I was crawling up to get to the closed stacks, and they turned the wader on, and I jumped off, and I got caught in that machinery and dragged up and... Really?

48:55.681 --> 48:56.202
...run through that.

48:56.222 --> 48:56.922
I'd have been crushed.

48:56.942 --> 48:57.623
That's not funny.

48:57.763 --> 48:59.525
No.

48:59.545 --> 49:00.486
But, uh...

49:00.955 --> 49:05.161
Such is the passion in the chase, you know, for the rare tone.

49:07.605 --> 49:11.130
I'm sorry to laugh.

49:11.151 --> 49:13.574
Did you ever want to tell people about this?

49:13.594 --> 49:20.044
Oh, yeah, I did.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.261
It's kind of a modern day Indiana Jones.

49:23.301 --> 49:28.127
Maybe someday I can give a lecture at the Roxborough Club or something.

49:28.147 --> 49:31.332
On the book collecting.

49:31.352 --> 49:32.233
The Groyer Club.

49:32.253 --> 49:33.575
The Groyer Club, yeah.

49:33.595 --> 49:34.676
The Groyer Club.

49:34.696 --> 49:40.144
Daniel Fearing had a book exhibit there in 1917 or 1912 or something.

49:40.244 --> 49:41.145
Is that right?

49:41.366 --> 49:46.613
Well, Scheide, I was telling you about it the other day, had an exhibit there last year, which I went to.

49:46.673 --> 49:46.893
Oh, he did?

49:46.913 --> 49:46.993
Oh.

49:47.014 --> 49:48.616
And that's how I met Scheide.

49:48.716 --> 49:48.816
Yeah.

49:49.167 --> 49:52.866
and then he invited me out to his collection of Princeton.

52:39.301 --> 52:43.867
The home of Carl Thrasher.

52:44.367 --> 52:46.310
Who's Carl Thrasher?

52:46.390 --> 52:54.941
Well, Carl was one of my... Carl was the only other individual that I met.

52:54.961 --> 52:57.524
Now, don't tell anybody this.

52:57.564 --> 53:00.668
This guy was abused and was a bee...

53:01.441 --> 53:03.423
Excuse me.

53:03.984 --> 53:05.165
Don't put this in the people.

53:05.186 --> 53:05.706
No, I won't.

53:05.746 --> 53:06.727
They'll pick him up.

53:06.747 --> 53:07.248
Okay.

53:07.348 --> 53:08.890
I don't even have his name.

53:08.910 --> 53:10.031
You met another guy.

53:10.051 --> 53:10.152
Okay.

53:10.712 --> 53:15.398
This young man was the only other book thief I met in my whole career.

53:15.718 --> 53:15.898
Okay.

53:16.159 --> 53:19.222
I moved into Ottumwa, and he got to be friends with me.

53:19.262 --> 53:20.244
He was a teenager.

53:20.264 --> 53:23.027
He was into American history.

53:24.188 --> 53:28.675
And he was as knowledgeable about American Indians as we are about books, believe it or not.

53:28.735 --> 53:35.326
Even though he was kicked out of school and a problem with people, he was really, you know, it was a tragic thing.

53:35.547 --> 53:41.937
But anyhow, he'd been nailing the Ottumwa Public Library for their Indian books.

53:43.179 --> 53:48.508
And here I was trying to hide this collection, and I found out, and I says to Carl, I says,

53:49.231 --> 53:51.393
You've got to quit doing this.

53:51.493 --> 53:55.137
Here, this place had been, you know, I didn't get any books.

53:55.157 --> 53:57.819
If you tell me a public library, you're losing all kinds of books.

53:58.380 --> 53:59.901
And here I am sitting here.

54:00.442 --> 54:04.446
So I befriended him and, uh... Don't forget, I need a roll of film.

54:04.966 --> 54:06.468
Oh, okay.

54:06.488 --> 54:09.351
Any kind of drug store or something.

54:09.371 --> 54:10.352
Any convenience store.

54:11.913 --> 54:12.714
Oh, okay.

54:13.294 --> 54:13.995
I'll take you downtown.

54:14.035 --> 54:19.120
But anyhow, I showed him my book collection and got him interested in

54:19.775 --> 54:20.736
Antiquarian books.

54:20.816 --> 54:25.401
I said, Carl, stop taking books out of the Ottumwa Public Library.

54:25.441 --> 54:28.024
If you ever need books, you tell me what you need.

54:28.044 --> 54:30.027
There are plenty of Antiquarian bookstores.

54:30.547 --> 54:31.729
He didn't want old books.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.130
He just wanted the information.

54:33.150 --> 54:34.552
He said, I'm different than you, Steve.

54:34.572 --> 54:35.653
I just want the information.

54:36.094 --> 54:39.918
I said, there are plenty of stores in Minneapolis you can buy that, not here in Ottumwa.

54:40.218 --> 54:41.820
I'll buy you any book you want.

54:42.341 --> 54:42.601
That's right.

54:42.621 --> 54:45.625
Don't take them out of the Ottumwa Public Library.

54:47.186 --> 54:47.807
Did he stop?

54:48.277 --> 54:49.699
I believe he did, yeah.

54:50.260 --> 54:52.264
But now they're blaming me for those books.

54:53.967 --> 55:01.680
But I don't want to see anything happen to them, and I just feel so bad.

55:02.020 --> 55:10.555
I tried, through the schools, to get, I knew an ex-faculty member at the Otoma High School, to get people interested in

55:11.041 --> 55:13.243
in his knowledge of Indian stuff.

55:13.263 --> 55:21.090
Because if you got the kid talking on Indian stuff and somebody could inspire him, they could get him into his other schoolwork and get him to learn.

55:21.110 --> 55:23.692
Because they were saying, oh, don't hang around with him.

55:23.772 --> 55:28.196
He's a troublemaker and he's a bad boy.

55:28.216 --> 55:29.237
And he was a good kid.

55:29.257 --> 55:30.618
He come from a terrible home.

55:30.678 --> 55:33.701
His dad stole him from his mother when he was eight months old.

55:33.721 --> 55:36.803
And he lived alone with his father.

55:36.823 --> 55:40.086
And his father beat him since he was really young.

55:40.319 --> 55:42.884
He used to come over to my house crying and drunk.

55:42.944 --> 55:46.210
And he was just an emotional wreck from the terrible home life.

55:46.230 --> 55:50.918
And all he had was his books and his Indian thing that he was interested in.

55:51.038 --> 55:56.168
And the way I got in with him is I brought Billy Laquay down, who's an Indian also.

55:56.809 --> 55:59.373
And the two of them got to be friends.

55:59.393 --> 56:04.723
And there aren't very many Native Americans here in Ottumwa.

56:04.855 --> 56:09.903
as much blood as he was, he was almost, you know, three quarters and bellies full.

56:10.344 --> 56:17.455
So through, see, I lived in the Native American part of Minneapolis.

56:17.475 --> 56:18.897
They got a ghetto that's like that.

56:19.599 --> 56:23.264
And through that, I got to be friends with him.

56:23.304 --> 56:26.469
And then we had this book thing in common.

56:26.489 --> 56:31.217
So he was my closest friend in Ottumwa.

56:34.572 --> 56:40.238
Well, I am not interested in that at all, so I wouldn't even worry about it.

56:40.258 --> 56:42.501
Oh, no, no, I just don't want him in trouble, that's all.

56:42.521 --> 56:43.582
Okay, come on.

56:43.602 --> 56:45.885
Look at all these guys.

56:48.728 --> 56:48.848
Yeah.

56:48.868 --> 56:53.634
Do you know of this book thing together here, me and this young fella, you know?

56:53.654 --> 56:55.296
He's the only other book thief I ever met.

56:57.478 --> 57:01.002
Well, he certainly didn't operate at your level.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.963
Oh, no, no, no, it didn't.

57:03.983 --> 57:06.326
Of course you are sophistication.

57:06.346 --> 57:14.335
No.

57:14.355 --> 57:16.237
You know what I told them?

57:16.257 --> 57:19.020
They had the weirdest crime column in this town.

57:19.541 --> 57:26.169
One time I read that an old lady was arrested in the Hy-Vee for stealing cans of tuna fish.

57:26.189 --> 57:27.871
It was in the paper.

57:27.891 --> 57:28.812
Then another time,

57:30.125 --> 57:38.453
A couple of high school girls were arrested for taking sunflower seeds and peanuts down at the drugstore.

57:38.553 --> 57:47.643
And I said, Carl, if I ever get in trouble, they're going to put me right in the October newspaper crime column with the tuna fish thief.

57:47.663 --> 57:50.806
Well, I guess I wound up with that.

57:50.826 --> 57:53.048
Never, Steve.

57:53.088 --> 57:53.669
Don't forget his film.

57:53.789 --> 57:55.150
No, I won't.

57:55.631 --> 57:59.895
I do have a roll, but I think I might want to shoot one of 24 shots.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.011
Yeah.

58:02.031 --> 58:04.266
He's making this house instead of things.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.775
Yeah, I'm going to take you up there.

01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:28.759
You said Kyle had a chance, this individual had a chance to see incunabular.

01:00:28.779 --> 01:00:29.380
Yeah.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.202
You said he goes with a drollier binding.

01:00:31.222 --> 01:00:31.563
Yeah.

01:00:32.824 --> 01:00:33.124
Vellum.

01:00:33.265 --> 01:00:33.885
That's funny.

01:00:34.406 --> 01:00:34.626
Yeah.

01:00:38.751 --> 01:00:41.074
He lives in a shack, doesn't he?

01:00:41.094 --> 01:00:41.314
Poor fella.

01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:42.355
That's his house up there?

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:43.857
And they rent that, yeah.

01:00:44.097 --> 01:00:46.480
And he's got books in there, right?

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.341
Don't tell anybody.

01:00:47.361 --> 01:00:47.641
No.

01:00:48.602 --> 01:00:49.604
I don't want any trouble.

01:00:49.624 --> 01:00:50.805
I don't want him to get in a tape.

01:00:52.051 --> 01:00:57.077
That's small stuff, yeah.

01:00:57.097 --> 01:01:00.922
Maybe we can help him when I get out of this.

01:01:00.942 --> 01:01:01.883
I'm gonna run up here.

01:01:01.903 --> 01:01:04.245
You can get some... Yeah, I gotta get some gas and I'll get some gas.

01:01:04.265 --> 01:01:07.469
Okay, why don't I go across the street and do that while you're doing this?

01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:08.070
There.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:08.811
Alrighty.

01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:09.432
Okay.

01:01:09.452 --> 01:01:10.673
I'll put the gas in for you.

01:01:11.955 --> 01:01:12.315
Here it is.

01:01:12.415 --> 01:01:13.977
I bought it for $16,000.

01:01:14.277 --> 01:01:16.880
Isn't this a fine old place?

01:01:17.561 --> 01:01:19.904
Biblioteca Blumberg.

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:20.725
Blumberg.

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:25.036
Look at how the kids have been breaking up my 60 Cadillac limousines.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:27.701
Oh, they even got the car door open.

01:01:27.721 --> 01:01:29.664
Now the cops got the keys to those.

01:01:29.804 --> 01:01:30.085
Those run.

01:01:31.327 --> 01:01:32.208
Land of the cops?

01:01:32.228 --> 01:01:32.849
Yep.

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:33.991
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:34.752
Isn't that a shame?

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.055
Man, that's terrible.

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:36.976
I'm sorry.

01:01:37.717 --> 01:01:39.240
I'm going to leave the newspaper here.

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.965
They took that a few days ago.

01:01:41.985 --> 01:01:43.868
Where is this?

01:01:43.888 --> 01:01:44.529
Out of the court.

01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:45.370
Oh, this one?

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.472
That is a nice picture.

01:01:46.552 --> 01:01:47.033
Look at this.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.064
When was that in the paper?

01:01:49.705 --> 01:02:01.910
Well, Nick's a reporter and he knows what Rhodes is like.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.775
Tell him what happened to your savings, life savings, Mr. Hall.

01:02:05.737 --> 01:02:08.042
Oh yeah, he stole a down bomb.
