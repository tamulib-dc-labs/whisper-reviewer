18:43.704 --> 18:44.645
$500.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.888
$2,500 is on the right now.

18:47.028 --> 18:50.712
$2,500 is earning around $2,500.

18:50.812 --> 18:51.373
525.

18:51.393 --> 19:00.683
Mark number 88.

19:06.907 --> 19:12.233
Please note there's a further addendum to the condition.

19:12.714 --> 19:16.498
The upper joint is split for about one and a half inches at the top without loss.

19:17.519 --> 19:19.722
The joint and hinge are otherwise sound.

19:20.543 --> 19:28.352
The spine is cocked, and there is a small, very light stain on the upper cover.

19:28.372 --> 19:29.733
This is very specific.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.214
Lot number 88.

19:30.683 --> 19:53.400
And I have $2,000 on the list of $2,000 now being $2,000, $2,000 now being $2,000, and $2,000 now being $2,500, $3,000, $3,500, $4,000, $4,500, $5,000, $5,500, with the absentee bid at $5,500 now, and $5,500 now being $5,500, and $5,500 now being $6,500.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.545
Add $5,500 now.

19:55.565 --> 19:59.593
Add $6,500 now, meaning it's $6,500.

19:59.613 --> 20:00.696
Add $6,000, $7,500.

20:01.076 --> 20:04.865
Add $7,500 now, meaning it's $7,500.

20:05.045 --> 20:07.991
Add $7,500 now, still the opportunity bid, $7,500.

20:10.116 --> 20:11.659
So the order is $7,500.
