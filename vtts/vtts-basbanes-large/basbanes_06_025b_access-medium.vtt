00:04.132 --> 00:05.834
No, probably mine would be movies.

00:07.997 --> 00:13.443
Because it's the field I'm in, so it would be easiest probably to think in those terms.

00:13.464 --> 00:16.968
But do you find that you are the character?

00:17.128 --> 00:18.610
People expect you to be the character?

00:18.690 --> 00:18.910
Yes.

00:19.671 --> 00:33.328
Yeah, because that show is so pervasive in the people's lives every day in almost every city in this country now with syndication on it, et cetera, that people come to you with this entire relationship intact between them and the character.

00:33.899 --> 00:36.381
And that's not who I am.

00:36.642 --> 00:37.523
They don't know who I am.

00:38.443 --> 00:41.026
But they come expecting certain things.

00:41.046 --> 00:49.714
And the people that don't at the same time, you know, it's interesting that you have this two-dimensional reality of a person every night in your television.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.776
And you see them in three dimensions.

00:51.877 --> 00:52.597
And something happens.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.980
Some people's minds just sort of go in neutral.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.063
They don't know quite how to absorb the information.

00:58.103 --> 01:03.568
And sometimes it can be an intrusion into one's life.

01:03.869 --> 01:05.751
The pie in the face goes with the job, I've always said.

01:05.771 --> 01:11.659
It's going to be hard, though, do you think, to break this stereotypical image that many people might have of you?

01:11.759 --> 01:26.577
I think that it will be a task, but not impossible, because I have to have faith in my ability as an actor, and what I have to do then is find a character that is as impactful but different than Dan Fielding.

01:26.858 --> 01:27.298
That's right.

01:27.318 --> 01:31.243
Even if I have to do it a little bit at the time, you know, if I have to go to...

01:32.033 --> 01:41.971
theaters around the country and start doing plays again for myself and for my work, as it were, as an actor, or sit down and write a film or, you know, just find different people out there to play.

01:42.031 --> 01:51.949
Fortunately, I have a little leverage, you know, a minuscule amount, and particularly in television, where most characters that I'd want to do right now, I could get somebody to let me do them.

01:52.368 --> 01:55.393
You've mentioned several times the stage.

01:55.493 --> 01:58.538
Do you fundamentally see yourself as a stage actor?

01:58.558 --> 02:03.605
No, because I started working on film and on the stage almost simultaneously.

02:03.625 --> 02:08.693
When I arrived here in L.A., I'd never acted before, except once in high school as a senior.

02:08.793 --> 02:10.516
Did you come here with the intention of being an actor?

02:10.536 --> 02:10.616
Yes.

02:10.917 --> 02:12.159
But having had no experience?

02:12.179 --> 02:13.080
No experience.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.525
So I got into a stage play very shortly after they got a job on television.

02:16.605 --> 02:19.590
So I started learning how to do both at the same time.

02:19.942 --> 02:25.650
We saw a TV show the other day with John Candy, and I thought you might have been an expert on the beach.

02:26.170 --> 02:27.933
Summer Vacation or something like that?

02:27.953 --> 02:28.593
Actually, I wasn't an expert.

02:28.613 --> 02:32.779
It was a fairly substantial role, but it was cut severely from the film called Summer Rental.

02:32.799 --> 02:36.704
Summer Rental, when they were out on the boat, and you're kneeling, smiling on the beach.

02:36.744 --> 02:45.055
Right, and the whole relationship between his wife and my character, and when the film was being cut, they realized it made her seem like a total...

02:45.693 --> 02:50.811
bitch that he was going through all these problems and she was off with this other guy, so the role was cut.

02:50.852 --> 02:51.554
Oh, that's too bad.

02:51.614 --> 02:52.477
Nah, you know.

02:52.497 --> 02:52.919
It happens.

02:53.742 --> 02:55.990
Checked his mouth, so.
