WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:06.335
We're on.

00:06.375 --> 00:14.064
Tell me a little bit about this opening paragraph that you've mentioned.

00:14.224 --> 00:28.279
I read an interview with you that this apparently came to you 15 or so years ago and that the novel developed as a consequence of having conceived that evidence.

00:28.299 --> 00:31.202
Well, yeah, I read that paragraph

00:31.992 --> 00:33.193
1977 or 78.

00:34.655 --> 00:36.877
So 18 years ago.

00:37.598 --> 00:41.502
Yes, I keep notebooks, and I consider this sort of a finished piece.

00:41.522 --> 00:44.104
It wasn't something I would have hampered with.

00:44.124 --> 00:46.827
It was almost like a poem.

00:46.847 --> 00:54.294
And then, in the intervening years, I wrote three more books, so it definitely wasn't time to write that book yet.

00:55.355 --> 00:56.937
But then, as I was

00:57.170 --> 01:02.421
beginning to write my second novel, I sometimes, you know, I go back and look at things that I had in my notebook.

01:03.563 --> 01:15.208
And I had things about these, the characters that I imagined, um, what were those words, and that they were the girls as adults, you know, very different kind of thing.

01:17.012 --> 01:17.693
And, um,

01:22.786 --> 01:30.479
And when I looked at it again, I had a strong sense of wanting really to enter the actual time frame of those words.

01:30.680 --> 01:38.132
That summer, that sense of heat and kind of intense pressure of adolescence almost.

01:39.575 --> 01:44.423
And for me, the whole world of the book was present in those.

01:44.555 --> 02:12.807
in that paragraph the characters the characters were fully formed no no not the characters not the story necessarily but the aura of it sort of the consciousness of it the whole sort of pervasive feel of the world of the book it's kind of like a sonnet almost it was complete into itself yeah but it was as though um it was prescient in a sense in that it was almost a sense that uh

02:15.048 --> 02:17.751
The book was formed, and I had to find my way to it.

02:21.276 --> 02:27.845
When you wrote that first paragraph, was it 1963, or did this more or less come afterwards?

02:27.865 --> 02:28.265
No, it didn't.

02:28.485 --> 02:39.840
Well, it didn't have a particular time frame, but I suppose in general I thought that it was happening sometime in the period of time in which I was around that age.

02:45.507 --> 02:55.880
And the timing of the book itself, I wanted very much to set the book before the world changed in this country.

02:57.102 --> 03:01.287
I hope that's not going to mess up your team.

03:01.388 --> 03:04.411
Not that I won't.

03:04.451 --> 03:09.939
The book takes place the summer after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

03:11.841 --> 03:14.164
At a time when, particularly in the region where the...

03:14.532 --> 03:25.423
In West Virginia, Kennedy really was a kind of prince or kind of warrior hero, as he was to most of the rest of the country, but probably even more so in that region.

03:25.443 --> 03:30.048
He was the first Catholic to ever have won an election in West Virginia.

03:33.451 --> 03:41.299
And my sense of the country in general is that everything changed after

03:41.667 --> 03:44.952
that string of murders that began with his assassination.

03:46.293 --> 04:01.074
And that I wanted this time in the girl's wad to have happened before that kind of national loss of innocence came place.

04:01.154 --> 04:08.164
Well, yeah, I didn't want that to be anything in the book but a kind of shadow.

04:08.735 --> 04:13.781
Well, you do more or less have an epilogue at the end, which kind of brings us close to it, certainly.

04:14.101 --> 04:14.762
That's right.

04:15.483 --> 04:20.949
We're certainly approaching this exceedingly dark hour, aren't we, since November 63?

04:21.689 --> 04:22.490
Yeah.

04:22.510 --> 04:28.537
Did you also, you know, artistically, I mean, did you really see this as something that you really wanted to compress?

04:30.119 --> 04:37.527
Well, my other novel was sort of masqueraded as a generational saga with the great lapses of time.

04:38.148 --> 04:41.391
And I wanted this book to be almost the opposite.

04:42.092 --> 04:46.216
I wanted the actual, the real time of the book to take place just in a few days.

04:46.376 --> 04:51.762
But I wanted to telescope into it the past, really, of all these characters.

04:52.623 --> 04:59.670
I wanted them to be completely separated from their families and sort of to be completely immersed in a primal world.

05:01.492 --> 05:04.375
But I wanted the reader to have a sense of what they each came from.

05:06.329 --> 05:12.077
You said earlier when we started that you saw these girls as women.

05:12.157 --> 05:18.445
I mean, so you actually see them as adults, is that correct?

05:19.767 --> 05:35.087
Well, my very old notes were, I don't think you want this in the interview because it sort of gets way off track, but a character named Amy J., which is not the same character that ended up in the book, but...

05:35.675 --> 05:51.632
It was her, as an adult, sort of taking off in a car and thinking about this, um, how can that happen during that summer?

05:54.114 --> 06:03.304
But my later sense of the book was very much centered on the characters as children.

06:03.324 --> 06:04.365
Aren't they good?

06:05.577 --> 06:10.604
I mean, you certainly must have some sense.

06:10.624 --> 06:22.281
I mean, this is, even if they make this compact at the end, believe me, that will not blow your resolution to the novel in any way, but I mean, there is this compact that they make.

06:22.301 --> 06:26.387
I mean, this is a secret.

06:26.407 --> 06:29.251
It remains a secret only with us and you can.

06:29.271 --> 06:33.798
And you must have some sense about this dramatic experience.

06:33.818 --> 06:35.280
Well, I don't know, you know.

06:36.610 --> 06:48.185
It's interesting to have sort of suppositions about it, but they do say, too, I mean, they do bring up the question of what if one of us really wants to tell?

06:48.445 --> 06:50.267
And they just say, well, then we will.

06:51.449 --> 06:54.873
They kind of leave everybody in and out.

06:57.216 --> 07:06.027
But I guess I had a very strong sense of it as being, you know, very difficult and damaging.

07:06.580 --> 07:20.918
what happens to them, but that they come through it in a way that they haven't been able to sort of get on top of the other things that have happened to them in their lives, which were things that were all sort of controlled or imposed on them by the adult world.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.605
Did you go to such a camp when you were a kid?

07:25.625 --> 07:28.949
I've never been in public again that I ever went to any camp.

07:28.969 --> 07:30.150
I mean, everybody has to ask.

07:32.834 --> 07:36.098
I never, I went to, it's like,

07:36.348 --> 07:40.133
a number of different camps to the point that they're all kind of melted together.

07:40.153 --> 07:51.729
You know, in my mind, um, I think there are different elements of different places that sort of felt, found their way into this world, but... I mean, the camp is certainly a presence here.

07:51.749 --> 07:59.300
You might even argue that it's almost a character in its own, right, in the novel.

07:59.320 --> 08:03.686
I mean, it's a place that's isolated, totally isolated.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.308
It's a pretty...

08:07.803 --> 08:11.848
I'm just wondering, did you conceive of this?

08:11.868 --> 08:13.270
Why did it have to be at this camp?

08:13.330 --> 08:17.836
I guess it's kind of close from the initial image that you had.

08:17.856 --> 08:19.698
Yeah.

08:19.718 --> 08:27.448
I mean, that image would have been Alma's point of view, I suppose, because they were the younger girls that were in the cabins.

08:27.468 --> 08:33.516
But the book then opens with what's really, I mean, the camp's really the first thing that's presented.

08:34.297 --> 08:36.460
It's sort of through Lenny's eyes.

08:37.587 --> 08:44.893
But that sort of slightly downtrodden sense of it is established very early.

08:44.913 --> 09:00.286
And also, I think, the sense that the world that contains the camp, the forest and that bridge and just the natural elements of it completely overhang it and sort of impose a character upon it.

09:01.267 --> 09:07.392
And that the whole thing that the sort of the counselors and the leaders try to maintain is really a kind

09:07.979 --> 09:19.756
the thought that reflects American culture at that time, I suppose, that feels very impermanent next to what the girls begin to experience.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.580
I wonder, you're the mother of young children.

09:22.600 --> 09:27.026
I have a couple of sons.

09:27.086 --> 09:31.152
Has motherhood in any way influenced your creative development?

09:31.587 --> 09:44.525
I mean, you certainly have written this viewpoint of Kit, and I wonder if you could talk to me a little bit about that.

09:44.645 --> 09:58.565
Let me just add parenthetically, I've heard you said that if Catcher in the Rye were to be written today, it would be marketed as a young adult book because it's from the viewpoint of Kit, you know?

09:58.585 --> 09:58.725
Uh-huh.

09:59.313 --> 10:07.341
Obviously, the themes that you developed in this novel, even though it is written from a new point of young students, is decidedly a dull novel.

10:08.863 --> 10:13.487
I'm just wondering about, I mean, is this a risky kind of a thing for a novelist to be writing?

10:13.507 --> 10:23.438
Well, it's a risky thing, but the book couldn't have been done any other way.

10:24.899 --> 10:25.860
I think that

10:28.085 --> 10:39.660
It's almost hard to respond to a question about how has kind of taking part in family life affected your writing.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.922
There's so many levels to it.

10:40.942 --> 10:43.204
I mean, on the one hand, it made writing much more difficult.

10:46.409 --> 10:47.610
Logistically.

10:47.630 --> 10:48.792
Logistically, yeah.

10:49.052 --> 10:53.738
And I think consciously, because I am always preoccupied with

10:55.017 --> 11:00.584
their needs, and I tend to take care of all that before I feel that I have the space to do anything else.

11:02.286 --> 11:11.737
But I think when you become a parent, the kind of quantum leap in terms of feelings of your own vulnerability.

11:12.398 --> 11:18.225
I mean, I think we all, when we're young, we have a sense of invincibility.

11:18.245 --> 11:24.552
And I think the minute you have children,

11:24.953 --> 11:30.382
that kind of disappears because you're no longer by yourself.

11:31.664 --> 11:39.318
And whatever happens to them is felt much more deeply even than what you imagine might happen to yourself.

11:39.338 --> 11:50.657
And I think the intensity of the book came out of those feelings of vulnerability and also the pockets in which I write.

11:51.177 --> 11:55.403
the pockets of time in which I write became more compressed even than before.

11:55.443 --> 12:05.898
So that the book almost needed to be very intense in order to sort of, for me to be able to leave it and come back to it in the way that I needed to.

12:06.119 --> 12:10.645
And it needed to be very, really a world unto itself that I could enter into.

12:10.665 --> 12:16.594
So in a strange way,

12:18.059 --> 12:22.083
This was the only kind of book I could have written at this period of my life.

12:22.703 --> 12:29.489
You mentioned that paragraph, you wrote that as an entity, 77, 78.

12:29.590 --> 12:34.654
And when did you start writing this novel?

12:34.714 --> 12:44.183
Well, Fast Lane was published seven years ago, and I think I had my second child shortly after that book came out.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.526
And I think when that baby was...

12:49.463 --> 12:52.107
Maybe around a year old.

12:53.429 --> 13:17.007
I began to work on this book, and its first incarnations were really very different from what the words were the same, but it was broken up differently, and there was a very long parson section, a very long linee section, and a longer, you know, they were all in long sort of pieces, and

13:18.708 --> 13:24.294
I kind of wrote half the book that way and then realized what was going to happen in the book.

13:25.976 --> 13:33.423
And I began moving towards that scene.

13:33.463 --> 13:37.447
And the book then was sort of apportioned differently.

13:38.609 --> 13:46.757
And I think also Carmody didn't really begin to be in the book.

13:48.037 --> 13:51.621
Because the presidency is about three years ago.

13:52.942 --> 13:53.944
Also, I stopped teaching.

13:54.624 --> 14:03.935
I stopped teaching about three years ago, and I really did, I'd say, at least half of the present book after that, in that period of time.

14:04.355 --> 14:05.516
And you say it did change.

14:06.337 --> 14:08.400
Are you a rewriter?

14:08.460 --> 14:10.682
I mean, are you an obsessive rewriter, I guess?

14:10.702 --> 14:14.026
Well, I am, but I changed it to word, you know, or phrase.

14:14.206 --> 14:15.968
It's not context, so.

14:16.285 --> 14:17.667
No, it's not context so much.

14:17.727 --> 14:25.457
I tend to write very much like a poet in that I kind of write line by line.

14:26.939 --> 14:30.264
And I seldom throw away, you know, great dreams and material.

14:31.926 --> 14:32.867
Save everything.

14:32.887 --> 14:39.937
But I do, you know, continue to go back over it kind of again and again.

14:41.459 --> 14:46.005
And I look at a page of prose almost the way you would look at a poem.

14:46.660 --> 14:50.966
in terms of the emphasis of lines and the stresses.

14:51.747 --> 14:55.051
I can sense that.

14:56.794 --> 14:56.934
Yeah.

14:57.014 --> 15:04.964
I absolutely can feel the poetic energy and the energy of a poet.

15:04.985 --> 15:09.531
Without any questions at all.

15:09.551 --> 15:13.596
Do you have any... I'm wondering how you see your...

15:15.736 --> 15:16.497
Yes.

15:16.737 --> 15:44.005
I mean, I think I write in a kind of organic,

15:44.272 --> 15:52.260
almost, kind of a way that's driven by a kind of subconscious agenda almost.

15:52.600 --> 15:58.767
And so the work has a kind of built-in thematic connection one to the other.

15:58.807 --> 16:14.042
I'm starting to think about these kinds of plans right now, kind of during this period of time.

16:15.760 --> 16:24.933
My sense of that is almost evolving right now.

16:29.860 --> 16:34.466
At what point are you happy?

16:34.486 --> 16:38.652
I mean, did you have a chance to go back and change anything at this point?

16:39.673 --> 16:42.477
Well, if I had a chance, I would probably

16:42.929 --> 16:47.456
take the book back and stay in it.

16:47.556 --> 16:48.538
And stay in it.

16:48.678 --> 17:02.499
I think there's really a, when you've lived with a book for a number of years, there's almost a period of grieving, I think, when you kind of let go of it and face the abyss of starting on something you don't know anything about.

17:02.519 --> 17:06.525
And I think I could have continued writing about this character.

17:06.545 --> 17:08.048
Really?

17:08.068 --> 17:11.653
But for the form of the book,

17:12.292 --> 17:15.978
it's important that it ends where it does.

17:15.998 --> 17:21.105
You mentioned, again, to go back, you do have a sense at least one of these characters as an adult.

17:24.290 --> 17:28.656
Would there be any thought on your part of writing a novel?

17:29.478 --> 17:29.818
No.

17:30.018 --> 17:33.584
They're finished, they're completed, completed work.

17:33.604 --> 17:39.092
No, but I think it's almost as though the

17:40.608 --> 17:45.492
the power of a writer's vision is very different faces from book to book.

17:45.512 --> 17:57.183
They are so recognizably plugged in, you know, in the world of the work that I don't feel, you know, the necessity of writing about these particular characters.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.706
I know these characters will be related in some direct way to whatever I write.

18:01.807 --> 18:09.754
This experience, you have to wonder how it is going to, if it's not these characters, how an experience such as this is going to

18:10.291 --> 18:21.942
Some of the publicity copy describes this as a rite of passage.

18:23.143 --> 18:27.127
Do you see this as a rite of passage novel?

18:27.147 --> 18:29.129
Maybe I misunderstand the phrase, rite of passage.

18:29.269 --> 18:38.037
Well, it has to be a rite of passage, although it's a much more intense rite of passage than most.

18:38.675 --> 18:40.118
Americans would experience.

18:40.138 --> 18:56.734
It's the kind of rite of passage that a kid in Somalia or really grows up in a kind of war zone might experience, but they might experience in a kind of day-to-day way that would completely obliterate them.

19:00.865 --> 19:07.493
I always sort of distrust the term Rite of Passage, because I think it's so much more a sense of evolution.

19:08.294 --> 19:13.141
But there are events in our lives where we really have a sense of before that happened and after that happened.

19:13.621 --> 19:15.364
And I think this is such an event for them.

19:16.325 --> 19:20.750
Rite of Passage is almost something that everybody has to go through.

19:20.931 --> 19:26.738
And therefore heralds your arrival into

19:27.140 --> 19:35.635
It's almost an admiration, I would believe.

19:35.735 --> 19:46.353
And yet, succeeding at it, or passing, surviving, I guess, is certainly a passage.

19:46.574 --> 19:48.818
Maybe I'm picking on it.

19:48.838 --> 19:51.983
I mean, there is a whole genre of literature, the rite of passage, kind of.

19:52.402 --> 19:53.223
novel.

19:53.303 --> 19:55.567
I don't think this falls into that.

19:56.328 --> 19:59.914
Maybe I'm wrong.

19:59.934 --> 20:05.323
Well, it's a convenient way for them to present the book, you know.

20:05.343 --> 20:11.312
I love to see people, but if you were to pay it on them, it's not, you know.

20:11.352 --> 20:15.899
Well, the whole myth that I think is a terrific job.

20:16.140 --> 20:16.941
I really enjoy working with

20:17.309 --> 20:23.416
You know, it is interesting when I mention to you that I'm doing this particular book for the Minneapolis people.

20:23.436 --> 20:26.119
They take me once a month.

20:26.139 --> 20:32.225
The first one I did for them was the new Tim O'Brien novel.

20:32.806 --> 20:38.732
But where this whole thing is a pitched battle between the forces of granite and the forces of evil.

20:39.613 --> 20:46.641
And once you got going into this, did you see this cosmic clash between

20:47.397 --> 21:09.844
I was looking at the idea of whether evil exists at all, you know, does evil exist?

21:12.406 --> 21:14.850
Or is evil just a function of damage?

21:15.030 --> 21:18.336
The fact that when people are damaged, they go on to damage others.

21:19.638 --> 21:23.445
They're acting under compulsions that almost were learned behavior.

21:23.485 --> 21:26.309
And they begin to fall apart.

21:26.329 --> 21:29.655
So this is a question that you were exploring in the existence of evil.

21:29.675 --> 21:29.775
Yeah.

21:29.795 --> 21:32.680
You didn't take this as if this was not a given at the outset then.

21:33.241 --> 21:33.481
No.

21:34.884 --> 21:36.406
And I don't know that innocence exists either.

21:36.426 --> 21:38.249
I mean, what is that all about?

21:38.329 --> 21:38.650
I mean...

21:39.507 --> 21:42.371
Somebody said to me, there's so much sexuality in this book.

21:42.391 --> 21:43.973
I mean, why?

21:44.013 --> 21:45.816
What is this all about?

21:47.018 --> 22:00.277
I see all relationships as very sexual, and the relationship between a mother and a child is very sexual because, in fact, there's no real boundary of identity there.

22:01.038 --> 22:04.362
I'm just checking.

22:04.382 --> 22:05.083
That's fine.

22:05.104 --> 22:05.464
Go ahead.

22:05.933 --> 22:09.919
I mean, Buddy has a very strong sort of sexual sense about his mother.

22:09.979 --> 22:11.902
It's just a given in their relationship.

22:11.922 --> 22:14.545
It's not a perversion of anything.

22:14.926 --> 22:19.412
It's just... And I think that exists between any bonded mother and child.

22:20.694 --> 22:31.970
And the consciousness is... Sexual consciousness between the girls is... Again, it's something that is a very natural part of these relationships.

22:32.972 --> 22:35.215
In a sense, it's almost like...

22:35.617 --> 22:40.882
sexuality between siblings or same-sex siblings.

22:46.928 --> 22:48.589
I don't see that as innocent or evil.

22:48.649 --> 22:51.732
I see it as, you know, that's just what it is.

22:53.134 --> 23:00.701
I know Tim, in his book, Evil actually has a color.

23:00.721 --> 23:03.223
Of course, he's writing about Pinto, which he gave me live.

23:03.243 --> 23:05.185
Of course, that was a name that they gave because of her.

23:05.536 --> 23:14.532
You clearly don't go that far.

23:14.653 --> 23:19.241
No, it's a Parson thing.

23:19.842 --> 23:20.804
It's a Parson.

23:21.565 --> 23:24.270
Yeah, I mean, he can feel...

23:24.588 --> 23:38.667
he really experiences evil as, you know, this being that is almost, he can hear walking, you know.

23:38.807 --> 23:40.249
Well, I don't know, I mean.

23:43.013 --> 23:45.576
No, I think we're still eating, but I have some more tea.

23:45.596 --> 23:46.497
Oh, certainly.

23:47.278 --> 23:52.165
I think they all represent the things of the author, you know, I mean, in a kind of gestalt sense.

23:52.482 --> 23:58.768
in the sense that all the parts of a dream are representing some part of the dreamer's consciousness.

24:03.812 --> 24:04.073
Okay.

24:07.796 --> 24:20.768
Again, I have here that... I was really impressed that you were able to... Was this a challenge for you to really try and do this in such a complex period of time?

24:21.187 --> 24:22.669
That must mean something.

24:22.709 --> 24:29.700
Again, you had to create these characters, develop them, had to give them their baggage, so to speak, and yet still bring them together in this place.

24:30.140 --> 24:36.690
It was a really challenging book, technically, and there were times when I really despaired.

24:36.710 --> 24:37.912
Really?

24:37.932 --> 24:50.991
Because I wanted to write it in this very dense prose, and yet I wanted it to feel dispensable almost, and I wanted there to be a sense of menace about it that really...

24:51.359 --> 25:10.442
sort of moved at the same time I wanted it to be beautiful, you know, towards almost to really, um, thanks, to really pull the reader into a sense of the world as they experienced it.

25:10.462 --> 25:18.852
Um, I noticed the phrase, country kids, town kids, uh, is this something

25:19.034 --> 25:21.217
You have those little things.

25:21.257 --> 25:33.251
You really don't hammer home the point that it's 63, but you do give us little things every now and then, the pink transistor radios, you know, that people had.

25:33.271 --> 25:36.254
Were you a country kid or a town kid, by the way, growing up?

25:36.274 --> 25:37.596
Well, I straddled the line.

25:37.696 --> 25:45.745
I was a country kid, but I was really a town kid.

25:46.126 --> 25:48.889
I mean, I lived on...

25:50.050 --> 25:51.051
out a rural road.

25:53.374 --> 25:57.239
And I rode the school bus, but my friends were all kids from town.

25:58.921 --> 26:01.083
And economically, I was more like a town kid.

26:02.025 --> 26:06.330
It was sort of before suburbs and that there were, it was the town.

26:07.291 --> 26:11.937
And then there were these sort of two-lane roads that went out to various hollows.

26:12.077 --> 26:18.825
And at the end of the two-lane road, there'd be dirt roads sort of going off into

26:19.177 --> 26:20.899
even more isolated, Hamlet.

26:23.803 --> 26:26.726
Is there a sense of foreboding about these roads, these areas?

26:27.708 --> 26:31.773
They just seem to lend themselves to this menace.

26:33.034 --> 26:37.480
I don't think the sense of menace has to do with the place at all.

26:38.701 --> 26:43.427
You certainly use the place effectively, however.

26:43.447 --> 26:47.412
But I saw it almost as an intervention.

26:48.269 --> 26:53.115
between the evil that kind of came into it.

26:56.499 --> 27:12.398
When Buddy talks at the end of the book about the car that's sitting there in the woods that he's still afraid to go near, he has a sense that the world, his world, the world of the woods, eventually will even break that down and sort of absorb it, take it in.

27:13.640 --> 27:18.225
And in this sense, he feels a sense of shelter and protection

27:18.577 --> 27:20.579
about the very world that he lives in.

27:21.700 --> 27:25.223
And in a sense, it's the only character to feel that from the natural world.

27:30.867 --> 27:37.773
I mean, it's magical and mythical to me more than menacing.

27:44.379 --> 27:47.942
Sort of like the sense of, you've been to Gettysburg,

27:48.850 --> 28:01.189
You know, when you walk around and you can feel this sense of, there's such quiet and kind of, and it's almost something seeping up from the ground that has to do with all that happened there.

28:01.689 --> 28:16.832
And I think in landscapes like West Virginia, you know, which reminds me of one of those sleepy hollow ideas, you know, very tall, rugged hills, very old hills, not like the Rockies, which would give you a sense of,

28:17.420 --> 28:28.817
of outplung grandeur, but they're very kind of brambly and camouflaging and secretive, and there's these valleys and these hills.

28:29.618 --> 28:34.566
Precisely what Tim O'Brien said he felt going through We Lie nine months afterwards.

28:34.586 --> 28:37.150
I mean, the time frame is there, nine months.

28:37.170 --> 28:44.180
You talk about Catesburg, but he said the feeling, not even knowing what had happened, I had to find out.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.043
You could absolutely feel this.

28:46.664 --> 28:59.386
Well, it's also the sense that he knew walking there what had happened.

28:59.967 --> 29:04.134
So in a way, he had a kind of information.

29:06.117 --> 29:08.942
But sometimes even when you don't know, you can feel it.

29:09.496 --> 29:10.277
He said that, too.

29:10.337 --> 29:13.881
I mean, this is before he knew really what had happened there.

29:14.562 --> 29:14.662
Yeah.

29:14.762 --> 29:18.647
I think that's basically what you're saying.

29:22.571 --> 29:30.741
You may say anything you'd like as I'm looking at it.

29:30.761 --> 29:35.166
There are so many writers, I mean, Shakespeare included, who had a

29:35.450 --> 29:38.554
You've found it impossible to characterize kids.

29:38.574 --> 29:39.335
You seem to do it.

29:40.556 --> 29:45.642
All of Shakespeare's kids are brilliant, you know, people who talk like adults.

29:46.824 --> 29:57.397
It must be quite a challenge to really transform yourself and to go back into the mind, to the feelings, to the emotions.

29:57.477 --> 29:58.538
And you do this often.

30:00.577 --> 30:28.156
Well, I tend to be attracted to characters who are outsiders in some way, who are sort of looking at things, but who are distanced from them.

30:28.176 --> 30:29.318
And I think children

30:31.188 --> 30:32.690
That's what children are.

30:32.830 --> 30:48.008
They are incredibly astute and they have a kind of newness, a kind of Zen quality to the way they perceive things, yet they live in a situation in which they are pretty powerless.

30:49.590 --> 30:57.499
And the way that they interpret events, the way that they perceive things is less layered over.

31:02.474 --> 31:15.095
So when you get into the mind of the child, you're always, you're looking at things through a kind of clarity of distortion.

31:19.282 --> 31:26.253
It's almost like a kind of shorthand for real meaning.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.258
Just to switch gears here.

31:29.947 --> 31:37.054
I think you've probably spent most of your life living away from the South, right?

31:38.816 --> 31:40.197
At this point, yeah.

31:40.217 --> 31:47.584
But yet, a number of people, they consider you certainly writing in a Southern tradition.

31:47.604 --> 31:54.711
I wonder, do you accept that?

31:54.731 --> 31:56.933
It doesn't seem paramount to me.

31:58.347 --> 32:04.954
You pick up a few Faulknerian kinds of things in here.

32:04.974 --> 32:12.462
Even your own publisher compares this novel with Harper Lee, for instance.

32:12.482 --> 32:26.057
I'm not suggesting that you do that, but maybe give me a sense of where you see your own place and development as a writer.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.358
Pick anywhere you want.

32:28.705 --> 32:44.866
I guess that I want to have a very intense connection to what I write, and I need that to sort of push through all the resistance that I have to writing.

32:45.948 --> 32:57.463
And when I write about children, for instance, I tend to go back to not just my own childhood, but a sense of...

32:58.169 --> 33:04.217
sort of the way children see things that I have to connect to where I grew up.

33:05.358 --> 33:10.585
And so that has sort of helped me keep the lines of access open to that world.

33:11.166 --> 33:14.390
Although I don't think the world that I imagined it was is there anymore.

33:14.410 --> 33:20.398
I think everything has really changed at this point.

33:20.418 --> 33:23.923
I think the other interesting thing about West Virginia is that West Virginia never felt

33:24.173 --> 33:26.255
It's not considered Southern by the South.

33:26.675 --> 33:28.917
It's not considered Northern by the North.

33:29.498 --> 33:33.802
Certainly not considered Northern by the North.

33:33.822 --> 33:36.845
It's almost a region of its own, a kind of no man's land.

33:36.865 --> 33:40.628
I mean, they didn't have the whole genteel aspect of the South.

33:41.349 --> 33:42.390
It never existed there.

33:44.132 --> 33:48.516
It was more hardscrabble than that and more kind of just individuals.

33:50.658 --> 33:53.320
And there wasn't much wealth.

33:53.620 --> 34:01.235
So when I hear about it being part of the South, I almost feel like saying, you know, it's not part of anything.

34:02.678 --> 34:03.300
West Virginia.

34:04.141 --> 34:04.722
Yeah.

34:04.742 --> 34:07.067
Well, Virginia is certainly southern.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.492
Yeah, but it's very different in Virginia.

34:09.512 --> 34:14.903
I mean, the only thing that feels comparable to West Virginia to me is sort of the mountains of Maryland.

34:15.136 --> 34:20.042
They speak there really with a more southern accent than they do in West Virginia.

34:20.062 --> 34:33.297
I drove my wife out to West Virginia a couple years ago, and it is, and nothing's unique in terms of landscape, but it really is an unusual place, precisely as you're describing it.

34:33.357 --> 34:44.991
It is entirely separate from, I'm sure the geography has a lot to do with where you get the sense of isolation, but it's by no means Virginia, is it?

34:46.203 --> 35:15.585
Well, a lot of them are Southern.

35:17.050 --> 35:20.573
I've always loved James Agee's work.

35:20.973 --> 35:28.880
I love everything Agee did in the first edition.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.321
I love it.

35:30.341 --> 35:30.942
That's wonderful.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.143
Including his Yale book, his book of poetry with a coo.

35:32.163 --> 35:40.230
Oh, my goodness.

35:41.050 --> 35:41.731
I've got to take my work.

35:42.011 --> 35:45.294
Yeah, you're going to have to have a doggy bag.

35:45.314 --> 35:46.635
You've got to start slowly.

35:55.255 --> 36:22.326
I can't remember what we were saying.

36:22.728 --> 36:25.711
We're talking about you teaching, I guess.

36:25.751 --> 36:26.471
Oh, yeah, writers.

36:34.018 --> 36:51.013
Sherwood Anderson, you know, I've always loved his work, and anything of Faulkner's, and some of Catherine Ann Porter, and you do a wealthy, but I think I was also influenced by people like

36:51.618 --> 37:01.628
Burroughs and Bruno Schultz and some of the Eastern European writers, Kafka, Poe.

37:02.949 --> 37:05.832
I'm not surprised by Kafka.

37:05.912 --> 37:11.417
I mean, there is definitely Kafka.

37:11.497 --> 37:19.245
It's a kind of a sense of lushness and sort of

37:19.462 --> 37:41.005
let out power in the prose, crossed with the kind of outcast macabre sense of life that Kafka worked with them.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.971
And I also love Chekhov's story.

37:47.744 --> 37:53.551
and Alice Munro's story.

37:54.712 --> 37:59.558
I think she's almost the kind of modern Chekhov.

37:59.618 --> 38:02.701
I think that work is connected.

38:02.721 --> 38:14.815
I mean, it's a very different subject matter, but the novelistic quality of her story is similar.

38:15.537 --> 38:26.848
Do you find the writing of stories any more difficult than the novels?

38:27.409 --> 38:32.734
I don't know about finding it difficult or more difficult.

38:38.640 --> 38:44.245
I loved writing stories, but I almost feel as though it was something I went through in order to

38:44.917 --> 38:48.302
kind of an apprenticeship, so to speak?

38:48.322 --> 38:58.738
Yeah, I mean, it may be that I will, you know, write stories again, but it's almost as though I begin working on something, and what I'm interested in doing is getting as deeply into it as possible.

39:00.019 --> 39:06.469
And I like the process that comes with being involved with one work for a long period of time.

39:08.011 --> 39:13.219
I had an interview with Grace Bailey a while ago, and, uh,

39:13.587 --> 39:17.813
She said, I can't do it.

39:18.074 --> 39:21.900
I mean, I'm a story writer.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.686
She said, I did one.

39:25.706 --> 39:26.707
And it was lousy.

39:26.727 --> 39:30.934
She said, it's not the rich of you.

39:32.316 --> 39:41.029
Maybe it's interesting, isn't it, that writers have this disability or this sense?

39:41.802 --> 39:45.686
I guess the novel is a marathon, isn't it?

39:45.706 --> 39:50.571
It's just a question of what kind of relationship a writer has to working.

39:50.751 --> 40:01.642
And I know Alec Alfiner, the last time I saw her, said to me, oh, I was there with a couple of other women, and she said, oh, you've all moved on to novels, and here I am still writing these stories.

40:03.864 --> 40:09.109
I mean, I completely disagree with this sort of idea that stories are somehow...

40:09.983 --> 40:13.069
You know, a second tier literature.

40:13.229 --> 40:14.231
Yeah, it's completely different.

40:14.291 --> 40:18.719
I mean, the story form is... It's like a sonnet and an ode, I guess.

40:18.779 --> 40:24.269
Yeah, there's no reason to graduate to writing novels.

40:25.170 --> 40:29.358
You know, fix it, but you did say that, in your case, the writing of stories was a form.

40:29.378 --> 40:33.966
I mean, it was by a word, but... I was getting to...

40:34.705 --> 40:37.207
something different than what they're doing.

40:37.227 --> 40:47.496
I mean, they're working in a form with which it gives them everything they need to sort of work with their material.

40:47.877 --> 40:50.019
And for me, the story wouldn't do that.

40:51.720 --> 40:57.805
Do you get the same pleasure from reading good stories as you do from good novels?

40:57.825 --> 41:00.768
Honestly, I read books as stories as though they are novels.

41:00.788 --> 41:04.071
I mean, for me, it's just presented in a different way.

41:06.295 --> 41:10.699
Do you have any expectations of yourself?

41:10.820 --> 41:17.907
I just try to stay out of the water.

41:20.169 --> 41:22.872
Of what, of yourself or of the writing?

41:22.892 --> 41:23.773
Of the writing.

41:25.094 --> 41:27.336
And do you immerse yourself into it?

41:28.557 --> 41:32.982
I mean, can you get two little kids at home?

41:33.002 --> 41:34.243
Can you separate yourself?

41:35.101 --> 41:38.866
Well, if they're out of the house.

41:38.886 --> 41:41.890
I mean, I don't work during vacation.

41:41.910 --> 41:44.313
I don't work for the whole month of December.

41:45.555 --> 41:46.576
You know, I don't work at this.

41:46.596 --> 41:48.699
How old are your kids, by the way?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.021
Well, they're quite old now.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.264
They're six and nine.

41:54.247 --> 41:56.289
I don't work on weekends.

41:57.571 --> 42:02.678
I mean, so I sit in around...

42:04.312 --> 42:15.265
you know, family life, and I could be much more hard-boiled about it, but I would have a lot of difficulty with that.

42:15.285 --> 42:17.627
Do you write on a computer, or do you write the old-fashioned way?

42:18.228 --> 42:18.969
Well, sort of a mixture.

42:19.029 --> 42:32.985
I tend to write in longhand when I start in the morning because I pick up the pages that I've done the day before and I read them and read them and read them and start kind of handwriting.

42:33.843 --> 42:39.210
And then I look at it on the machine and add things as I'm typing it out and then edit it again by hand.

42:39.771 --> 42:41.092
You know, sort of that type of thing.

42:41.332 --> 42:43.015
You print everything out when you have a version?

42:43.716 --> 42:44.537
I print out every day.

42:46.239 --> 42:53.588
You know, Dr. Osset, he's writing on a computer, but he said it doesn't exist until I print it.

42:53.648 --> 42:56.251
Right, I don't feel, no, I don't relate to the screen.

42:56.271 --> 43:00.677
But of course, I know he's an old editor talking, and I'm sure there's this anxiety about it.

43:01.433 --> 43:07.702
disappear into the closet that's happened to my younger daughter.

43:08.123 --> 43:13.411
I would never read my work on the machine.

43:13.431 --> 43:26.931
There have been studies at MIT that suggested that a work that is read from the screen reads differently to the reader than it would on a manuscript page and also on a printed page.

43:26.951 --> 43:30.276
And I know this, having written for newspapers,

43:31.133 --> 43:47.476
I'm sure that as a writer, you feel that you can't really judge the work from what you see on a screen.

43:47.496 --> 43:48.698
You have to see it on a paper.

43:48.718 --> 43:50.340
Do you find that?

43:51.485 --> 43:52.366
Yeah.

43:52.386 --> 43:55.670
You probably do your revisions on a manuscript, right?

43:55.690 --> 43:56.671
Yeah.

43:57.372 --> 44:07.885
Well, I read on it by hand, and I add things, because often as I'm typing, I'll add more right on the screen.

44:07.905 --> 44:08.286
That's right.

44:09.808 --> 44:14.033
They said word processes have added and made books longer.

44:14.418 --> 44:16.400
Because it's easier to do.

44:16.440 --> 44:21.006
You know, when you're writing nonfiction, you can always just drop in a paragraph here or together with something.

44:21.026 --> 44:24.030
I mean, the pagination all takes care of itself.

44:24.050 --> 44:28.295
You don't have to retype the whole manuscript.

44:28.315 --> 44:31.579
You know, it's just done.

44:31.599 --> 44:32.841
That's happening.

44:32.861 --> 44:34.843
Am I missing anything?

44:34.943 --> 44:35.724
That's okay.

44:35.744 --> 44:42.973
Am I missing anything, do you think, in this exchange here?

44:43.358 --> 44:55.696
I really enjoyed the novel, I have to say.

44:55.736 --> 45:05.631
Tell me about these themes, the child abuse theme, the... Yeah, this is a question.

45:05.651 --> 45:11.560
Even though you had a sense of where the characters were going with the story, did you also...

45:12.265 --> 45:21.138
understand at that point the various, the numerous themes that you would be evolving in the plot, folding.

45:21.799 --> 45:26.166
Because you have a number of them.

45:26.186 --> 45:31.233
Yeah, well, I think it's, the process itself stays one step ahead of the writer's promise.

45:33.957 --> 45:39.906
You know, a lot of what's in the book evolved sort of in the language itself.

45:39.926 --> 45:41.749
That's a wonderful discovery.

45:42.573 --> 46:04.142
All right.
