WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:09.440
They do 79 meters high.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.762
79 meters high.

00:11.782 --> 00:13.304
And you get 22 levels.

00:13.864 --> 00:16.527
Stories we call it, yeah, 11 stories, yeah.

00:16.667 --> 00:17.107
Sorry for that.

00:17.127 --> 00:17.848
No, no, let's try that.

00:17.988 --> 00:27.878
I'm just doing the translation.

00:30.912 --> 00:34.656
There is no what?

00:35.537 --> 00:37.339
Public activities on the tour.

00:37.459 --> 00:38.100
I see, yes.

00:41.824 --> 00:57.681
The tour is like tower, it means the building, right?

00:57.701 --> 00:57.781
Yes.

00:57.801 --> 01:00.784
The two classrooms of the tour are completely empty.

01:02.789 --> 01:05.052
I'll show you why in a few minutes.

01:05.673 --> 01:14.285
After you've got seven floors of administration, you call the... On all four, seven floors, yes.

01:14.305 --> 01:16.569
Yes, there is always the same organization of each floor.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.294
So seven floors of administration.

01:20.314 --> 01:24.900
From outside, it's the floor that you can see with the mobile office.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.607
Of course, you saw when you were in Thierry's offices.

01:30.025 --> 01:36.357
the shuttles are moving and after you get even flows of

01:37.130 --> 01:39.593
storage booth.

01:39.613 --> 01:48.082
This is from outside, this is the floors without the shutters.

01:49.423 --> 02:04.639
This is longer than a football field.

02:16.297 --> 02:17.639
This room that we're in now.

02:17.679 --> 02:22.145
The entrance room, the reception hall.

02:24.469 --> 02:27.693
I need to show you from outside.

02:27.713 --> 02:31.899
You don't see the way we enter.

02:32.340 --> 02:33.502
Oh, this is magnificent.

02:33.522 --> 02:34.363
This is huge.

02:34.884 --> 02:37.247
It's going to be like a forest at some point.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.070
What do you call it?

02:39.090 --> 02:39.871
The garden?

02:39.911 --> 02:41.393
The garden.

02:41.643 --> 02:42.845
What kinds of trees are those?

02:43.085 --> 02:43.847
Are they fine?

02:44.047 --> 02:52.180
I'm going to explain to you the garden.

02:52.801 --> 03:01.975
For the library, you've got a big esplanade, which is going to be a public place very soon, when all the areas around the library are going to be finished.

03:02.316 --> 03:08.646
We'll have shops around the library, offices, a lot of different activities close to the library.

03:09.250 --> 03:15.198
And also you will have the creation of a big network, communication network.

03:15.218 --> 03:26.134
You will have a new subway, which will be the new subway, which should be ready for June next year.

03:26.735 --> 03:31.682
You will be from the center of Paris in 12 minutes.

03:31.702 --> 03:31.762
12?

03:31.782 --> 03:31.862
Yes.

03:32.182 --> 03:32.964
Excellent.

03:33.124 --> 03:38.211
The name is Meteor Club, so you have seen in Paris the works.

03:38.731 --> 03:42.557
Also, just behind the library, you've got the network of the ROR.

03:42.577 --> 03:46.723
The ROR is a suburban station, which joins the suburban town to Paris.

03:47.464 --> 03:55.195
Just here behind the library, and the rail network is going to be covered by a concrete road.

03:56.858 --> 04:04.930
So from the other side of the library, you will be able to go up of the rail network.

04:05.030 --> 04:07.033
All the rail network is going to be covered.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.563
from the station to the periphery.

04:10.583 --> 04:16.127
It means it's going to be a big road of more than two kilometers.

04:17.348 --> 04:26.216
And you will have a stop of the Royal Metro and the Suburban train, just behind the tower.

04:26.876 --> 04:34.763
So very soon, in one year, you will have two subways and one Suburban station to preserve the library.

04:34.863 --> 04:36.885
It's very difficult to come here.

04:37.118 --> 04:40.161
How many employees here, Frederick?

04:40.301 --> 04:46.266
At the moment, we are around 1,800 people.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.089
We should be 2,500 people.

04:49.169 --> 04:52.252
In all four, to what?

04:52.272 --> 04:57.817
Yes, in this two roles, and also in Summer House, but I'm going to speak about it later.

04:57.837 --> 05:00.779
And in the whole library, we should do it.

05:00.819 --> 05:02.601
Oh, so that will include the issue, too?

05:02.621 --> 05:03.341
Yes.

05:03.361 --> 05:05.083
The whole library will be...

05:05.553 --> 05:07.115
2,500 people.

05:07.976 --> 05:11.319
So when you arrived to the East Planet, you saw that it was discovered by wood.

05:11.660 --> 05:17.726
This is a wood which comes from Amazonia, so it did a lot of polymics because of the deforestation of the Amazonia.

05:17.746 --> 05:18.868
What is the wood again?

05:18.888 --> 05:20.890
In France, it's hippish.

05:20.910 --> 05:21.951
It's a kind of tech.

05:22.752 --> 05:32.202
I don't know the... Yes, it's a kind of... It's not the tech because the tech is protected, but it's a kind of... It takes a lot of weather and weathering and things very strong.

05:33.734 --> 05:40.244
And on each extremity, because perhaps you have seen that the library is half empty, half deep.

05:40.264 --> 05:40.624
Down?

05:42.567 --> 05:42.988
Down.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.632
For the reception level.

05:45.652 --> 05:52.201
So to delimitate the library in the area of Paris, the architect decided to put on each extremity of the library the torres.

05:52.742 --> 05:56.808
And he said that the torres are like open bodies.

05:56.828 --> 06:02.897
So they've got 22 floors, 79 meters high, and you've got two different activities.

06:03.198 --> 06:07.073
The two first floor are empty, but we are going to see why they are empty in a few minutes.

06:07.936 --> 06:14.642
After you've got seven floors of administration with the mobile shutters, and after you've got the floor of storage roof.

06:15.179 --> 06:24.248
Are the books going to be visible through the windows?

06:24.268 --> 06:37.922
No, it was the first idea of the architect to put a window and we wanted that from outside we could see our books years after years, our patrimony.

06:37.942 --> 06:43.127
But there were so many polemics about the fact that the books behind the glass

06:43.107 --> 06:48.814
It's going to be damaged, but you decide to put the shutters.

06:50.397 --> 06:52.339
And then the books will be behind the shutters?

06:54.762 --> 06:55.864
The shutters and the books?

06:56.384 --> 06:58.727
No, you've got the glasses.

06:58.747 --> 07:01.992
It's a very special glass.

07:02.112 --> 07:04.575
You've got a wall for the shutters.

07:04.792 --> 07:27.623
It's in a wood, it's a wood which comes from Africa.

07:27.643 --> 07:28.223
It's a wood we call hukumech.

07:28.244 --> 07:29.105
Hukumech, but I don't know the translation.

07:29.125 --> 07:29.465
Can you write it?

07:29.485 --> 07:29.565
Yes.

07:29.585 --> 07:29.766
Hukumech.

07:29.786 --> 07:29.866
Yes.

07:29.886 --> 07:30.366
It comes from the Congo.

07:30.386 --> 07:30.607
The jungle?

07:30.627 --> 07:30.867
From Africa.

07:32.416 --> 07:34.419
And that's the wood in the windows.

07:34.479 --> 07:40.850
Yes, but in fact, it's a very thin slice of wood because it's a metal structure.

07:40.870 --> 07:45.458
And on the metal structure, you've got a very thin slice of this wood.

07:46.219 --> 07:51.708
Behind this wood, you've got a wall.

07:52.049 --> 07:57.698
And after, you've got a protection against fire, rock wall, wood wall, rock wall.

07:58.319 --> 08:27.263
um what is it no uh behind you've got a thing to protect the system sprinkler system or yes you've got it but i mean uh the protection between insulation yes insulation because it's rock full okay this is something someone who's speaking after you get the boots they're stored in a in a

08:27.597 --> 08:40.680
And downstairs you have another storage area with a special way to storage.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.705
I'm going to show you if you can go downstairs.

08:43.725 --> 08:50.637
So here you will have half of the storage capacity of the books, and downstairs you will have another storage area.

08:50.657 --> 08:52.440
I'm going to show you when you will be downstairs.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.482
I love this garden.

08:54.722 --> 08:56.586
Did they bring trees?

08:56.606 --> 08:57.970
They must have brought the trees.

08:58.932 --> 09:03.302
The idea of the garden from the architect came from the history of the libraries.

09:03.342 --> 09:10.699
The library comes from the 14th century, and according to the architect, what was

09:10.679 --> 09:19.922
The buildings which were the most representative of the Middle Age construction were the religious construction.

09:20.103 --> 09:27.642
That's why they decided to build a library like a kind of monastery in the central garden and a public activity all around the garden.

09:27.622 --> 09:32.872
Is there a published statement on this, of who the architect is and what his philosophy was?

09:33.554 --> 09:42.731
I'll ask Monsieur Gouillet, maybe he knows, if there is a statement about, a published statement about his philosophy.

09:42.751 --> 09:44.635
Yes, there is a book I'm going to show.

09:44.935 --> 09:49.605
Here you've got a library, and I think they've got a book which explains it.

09:49.625 --> 09:50.908
Oh, maybe they have a book for sale.

09:50.928 --> 09:52.130
Okay, that'll be excellent.

09:52.150 --> 10:00.328
So after you've got two levels in the library, this level is a general level, open to heavy people under 80 years old.

10:00.764 --> 10:07.972
because the level of the books are too high for younger people.

10:08.313 --> 10:10.555
Research people, but open to everybody.

10:10.575 --> 10:15.040
And the books on this level have been good especially for this level.

10:16.041 --> 10:27.795
And downstairs, perhaps in June next year, we are going to open the research level, which will be, in fact, the moving of all the books and periodic course, which are at the moment in the whole library.

10:27.855 --> 10:29.657
They are going to move.

10:30.599 --> 10:31.825
At the end of the summer?

10:32.127 --> 10:32.810
Three million?

10:34.559 --> 10:35.483
Ten million.

10:35.684 --> 10:35.986
Ten million?

10:36.147 --> 10:37.875
Ten million of books are going to move.

10:38.243 --> 11:01.365
All the books since we organized a legal deposit with Francois I, it was in the 60th century, in 1536, we organized a legal deposit.

11:01.683 --> 11:07.491
First law in the cultural realm, and this is the oldest cultural law we've got in France.

11:08.412 --> 11:13.799
And all these books are going to move from the whole one to this new library.

11:13.819 --> 11:15.541
And they will be storage in two areas.

11:16.242 --> 11:25.995
The more often hasps will be storage behind the research level, and the less hasps will be storage in the towers.

11:26.876 --> 11:28.939
And hasps for the books which have never been asked,

11:29.172 --> 11:35.901
There will be storage somewhere else, close to Paris, in Mount Lavallee, just close to Eurodistance.

11:35.921 --> 11:36.121
A where?

11:36.141 --> 11:41.549
The same architect built a special... A warehouse?

11:41.569 --> 11:41.789
Yes.

11:41.809 --> 11:42.250
What was it?

11:42.270 --> 11:43.752
Do you know the name of the architect?

11:43.772 --> 11:44.012
Yes.

11:44.032 --> 11:45.614
Dominique Perrot.

11:45.634 --> 11:46.215
Dominique.

11:46.235 --> 11:58.412
Why don't you spell it easier?

11:58.432 --> 11:58.572
It's...

11:59.834 --> 12:01.256
We'll check.

12:01.857 --> 12:04.680
We'll be sure to check it.

12:05.201 --> 12:15.014
So from outside, you can take what you call a 12-hour tour to go to the library.

12:15.034 --> 12:20.661
You've got one on this way, and you've got another one on the opposite side.

12:21.063 --> 12:27.470
And when you arrive in the library, you will see that it's completely built in a symmetric way of construction.

12:27.490 --> 12:31.295
All the things you can find on this way, you get exactly the same on the other side as the library.

12:35.299 --> 12:39.104
So there's an entrance just like this on the other side?

12:39.684 --> 12:39.845
Yes.

12:40.565 --> 12:43.068
And a restaurant on the other side, too?

12:43.128 --> 12:47.213
No, just on this side, because it's just a restaurant.

12:47.233 --> 12:50.597
We put that here, but we're going to put a new restaurant here.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.648
So here you are in transport.

12:56.469 --> 13:12.570
You've got the catalog of the library, which is available here, and this side on the other side also.

13:13.972 --> 13:17.036
So here you will be able to buy your ticket for one day.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.099
Oh, it's all automated.

13:19.720 --> 13:28.515
It's 20 francs for one day if you buy a ticket for this level.

13:29.116 --> 13:32.201
Otherwise you can buy a card for one year.

13:32.502 --> 13:38.011
So the card you need to subscribe to the welcome desk.

13:38.632 --> 13:40.496
Just close to the welcome desk which are there.

13:41.097 --> 13:45.424
You've got the cashier.

13:47.024 --> 13:48.485
And then you can green the reading rooms.

13:48.726 --> 13:51.929
I will give you tickets if you want to have a look during the day.

13:51.989 --> 13:56.093
That would be nice.

13:56.594 --> 14:00.798
That would be nice.

14:01.859 --> 14:06.864
And after you've got the reading rooms which are on this level and on the other way.

14:07.065 --> 14:08.866
I'm going to take a map if you want.

14:08.886 --> 14:12.390
Okay, good.

14:12.995 --> 14:15.998
You've divided the library into five different departments.

14:16.158 --> 14:18.020
You've got literature and art department.

14:18.941 --> 14:23.005
You've got just here downstairs, you can take a leaf which is in the corner.

14:23.465 --> 14:26.148
You've got the law department.

14:27.029 --> 14:30.592
Here you've got the science and technical department.

14:30.832 --> 14:32.374
Here it's audiovisual department.

14:33.235 --> 14:40.842
And on the other side here you've got... So down the reception, you've got the...

14:41.615 --> 14:44.639
philosophy and history departments.

14:48.223 --> 14:51.967
Here you will have all the contents of each department.

14:51.987 --> 14:52.788
Periodicals.

14:53.569 --> 15:02.800
You get reading rooms just for the periodicals, but also you get some periodicals which are available in each room according to the aim of the room.

15:03.000 --> 15:03.280
Sure.

15:04.562 --> 15:07.245
You have 2,000 seats.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.326
That's a lot.

15:08.346 --> 15:11.470
2,000 reading seats, desks for readers.

15:12.158 --> 15:36.293
So here you've got information, all the time you get different information to the readers and for instance here you've got all the rooms are available or not.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.962
What does that mean?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.524
Seats available, seats not available.

15:40.805 --> 15:44.609
Here for the audiovisual screen, they are not available now.

15:44.809 --> 15:45.730
It means that it's full.

15:46.411 --> 15:53.099
So you know immediately before buying a ticket, if you will find a place, a seat in this room.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.941
And all the information of the library.

15:59.346 --> 16:01.588
The air is beautiful coming in.

16:03.965 --> 16:07.012
So for reader, he comes for the first time in the library.

16:07.574 --> 16:13.929
He can meet a librarian, and the librarian is going to explain to him if he can find what he wants in the library.

16:14.169 --> 16:21.687
He can have a look by himself in the catalog, but if he's not really

16:22.409 --> 16:25.413
find the catalog, he can ask to a library.

16:25.433 --> 16:26.775
So the library will be available?

16:26.795 --> 16:27.376
Yes.

16:27.796 --> 16:31.922
So they will tell him if he can't find what he's looking for in this library.

16:32.442 --> 16:35.326
Otherwise, if it could go in another library.

16:35.346 --> 16:37.449
So the machine is backed up by a person?

16:37.469 --> 16:40.153
Yes.

16:40.173 --> 16:46.341
And later, so perhaps in June, we hope in June, when we will have the research show,

16:46.726 --> 16:55.596
You will need to meet a librarian to explain to him the aim of your research, and he will decide if you allow him or not to go to go downstairs.

16:55.616 --> 17:03.065
So if you want to have a look downstairs, I will give you a ticket for the desk level, and you will be able to go to each department.

17:03.385 --> 17:06.269
With one ticket, you can go to all the departments of the library.

17:06.289 --> 17:07.570
We can do that after our interviews.

17:07.951 --> 17:12.396
Also in the library, we've got a cultural...

17:13.152 --> 17:14.414
Cultural activities.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.134
And exhibitions?

17:15.335 --> 17:18.298
Yes, we've got an exhibition room here.

17:18.318 --> 17:22.343
At the moment there is a small exhibition about photographers.

17:22.484 --> 17:23.044
It's free.

17:23.365 --> 17:27.650
Is that open to the general public?

17:27.870 --> 17:28.371
Yes.

17:28.871 --> 17:34.198
And also we've got two auditoriums in the library for conferences and so on.

17:34.617 --> 17:47.154
Here on this side you've got an auditorium, a small auditorium, you've got 200 seats, and on the other side you've got another auditorium of 350 seats.

17:51.199 --> 17:57.267
And here at the moment you've got the library, but the library later is going to be behind, I'm going to show you.

18:01.432 --> 18:08.040
This will be like a shock, in other words, right?

18:08.060 --> 18:10.964
It's a massive door.

18:11.845 --> 18:15.970
This is like out of a movie, isn't it?

18:16.250 --> 18:22.718
You know, at the beginning, I told you that the two first floors of the drawers are empty.

18:22.818 --> 18:26.022
In fact, here you've got the two first floors of the drawers.

18:26.153 --> 18:29.837
They are just here to give the light to these mechanical stairs.

18:29.997 --> 18:33.640
This is the way the researchers will go downstairs.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.442
What is the function of this area?

18:35.963 --> 18:36.943
What will the function be?

18:37.084 --> 18:38.785
It's to receive the researchers.

18:39.886 --> 18:40.387
To receive?

18:40.427 --> 18:41.528
The researchers.

18:41.708 --> 18:42.169
Oh, I see.

18:42.189 --> 18:42.489
Okay.

18:44.911 --> 18:50.877
The researchers come in, and this was all built to gain the natural light, to have the natural light come in.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.759
That was one of the points.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.000
How many escalators?

18:54.470 --> 18:55.571
Like that, like this one?

18:55.591 --> 18:55.672
Yes.

18:55.912 --> 18:59.697
You've got four, one under each tower.

18:59.717 --> 19:07.546
In fact, you've got a tower on each extremity of the reception area, and you've got a door.

19:07.566 --> 19:12.152
We will take the door later, and you take the stairs to go downstairs.

19:12.172 --> 19:14.275
Is that stainless steel?

19:14.295 --> 19:14.615
Yes.

19:14.795 --> 19:20.022
The different materials that Dominique Perrier use are the concrete,

19:20.930 --> 19:25.906
The steel, so you've got a full steel or steel like a jumper?

19:26.368 --> 19:27.512
A mesh.

19:27.572 --> 19:29.859
A wire mesh, yeah.

19:29.879 --> 19:33.471
And because it's very cold material, you also use the wood.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.817
So in the reading rooms you will see it's full of wood.

19:37.699 --> 19:42.165
You've got the wood on the esplanade, so you've got the wood on the shutters.

19:42.706 --> 19:43.267
On the shutters.

19:43.568 --> 19:47.854
And the concrete is going to stay like that.

19:51.940 --> 19:57.248
That's for the glass, it's a very special glass.

19:57.835 --> 20:12.483
which has been created exceptionally for the library, because when you get such a big superficie of glasses, it's a little bit green, and the architect wanted a glass completely clear.

20:13.545 --> 20:20.738
So it's a French company, which is called Saint-Gobain, which created this especially for the library.

20:20.937 --> 20:23.962
Is it also resistive and must be resistive to heat and light?

20:23.982 --> 20:25.104
Yes, I'm going to show you.

20:25.124 --> 20:35.942
In fact, you get a slice of glass after you've got an empty space with air conditioning to involve the conversation.

20:36.158 --> 20:41.427
to resist because when you are on the top of the toga, there's a wind, so it's to resist to the wind.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.954
And after you could steal another slice of... Another?

20:45.974 --> 20:46.635
So it's three?

20:46.855 --> 20:47.857
No, two.

20:47.877 --> 20:54.508
One, an empty space with a hair conditioning, and another... Slap.

20:54.588 --> 20:55.149
Slap.

20:55.169 --> 20:55.890
I'm going to show you.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.152
Oh, okay.

20:57.172 --> 20:57.593
That's it.

21:01.353 --> 21:07.306
In fact, the library was also a laboratory for our development here.

21:07.547 --> 21:10.974
The concrete is in the country.

21:10.994 --> 21:14.181
There is a very special concrete.

21:17.519 --> 21:24.769
So here it's a reception for the auditorium.

21:24.829 --> 21:27.392
And then we also put the restaurant.

21:27.412 --> 21:45.075
But later the restaurant is going to be... So later here you will have the restaurants.

21:45.876 --> 21:46.497
Two levels.

21:46.915 --> 21:51.887
I don't think the library is going to be here.

21:51.907 --> 21:53.591
Like the bookstore, the library.

21:54.614 --> 21:59.425
It's going to be, but at the moment it's still not finished.

21:59.445 --> 22:05.059
That's why you've got this very small restaurant.

22:06.811 --> 22:12.861
and you will have access directly from this planet.

22:13.362 --> 22:15.185
That will be open space.

22:15.205 --> 22:16.607
They'll make a little garden or something.

22:16.627 --> 22:25.181
When you will go in the reading rooms, you will see that from the reception reading rooms, for the reading rooms for the reception, the light comes from the garden.

22:25.762 --> 22:32.633
But the reading rooms for the public reading rooms will see that the light comes from downstairs because

22:33.085 --> 22:34.427
You see the esplanade.

22:34.888 --> 22:37.932
On each side of the esplanade, each extremity, you've got the towers.

22:38.693 --> 22:43.760
And between each towers, you've got a kind of gap, which joins all the towers.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.763
We call that the Garden Street.

22:46.424 --> 22:52.272
And the aim of this gap is to give the light from behind to the reading rooms.

22:52.292 --> 22:55.076
When you go in the reading room, you will see the light.

22:55.096 --> 22:56.458
What did you call it again, the name of it?

22:56.958 --> 22:58.180
The Garden Street.

22:58.220 --> 22:59.582
The Garden Street, okay.

23:00.288 --> 23:02.972
And also there is two functions, in fact.

23:02.992 --> 23:10.802
It gives a light to the reading room, from behind, but also it's an exit fire in case of problems.

23:10.822 --> 23:16.270
You open the drawer and you can take the stairs to be outside.

23:16.991 --> 23:20.375
Boy, the architect had grand vision, didn't he?

23:20.415 --> 23:24.741
The scale is quite amazing.

23:24.761 --> 23:25.001
It is.

23:25.021 --> 23:26.764
It's the future.

23:26.784 --> 23:27.004
Yes, it is.

23:27.676 --> 23:29.578
They're scratching the wood, though.

23:29.638 --> 23:31.020
They should be careful.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.044
For instance, you see the stairs to go to the library?

23:34.484 --> 23:34.804
Yes.

23:35.285 --> 23:41.212
Behind the stairs, there's a road to disturb the libraries.

23:42.293 --> 23:44.536
We drove around in the taxi, as a matter of fact.

23:44.876 --> 23:45.938
I know the taxi.

23:46.338 --> 23:52.025
All the delivery companies and so on come directly and do the tour of the library.

23:52.045 --> 23:52.786
Underground?

23:52.806 --> 23:53.146
Yes.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.848
I'm going to show you to just have a look.

23:56.515 --> 24:06.246
It's not very important.

24:06.266 --> 24:09.590
No, it's interesting.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.373
It's how access is very important.

24:12.393 --> 24:13.134
This is the stairs from outside.

24:13.154 --> 24:15.076
And all around the library, you've got a road to the different areas of the library.

24:15.096 --> 24:18.340
It's like the Pentagon, it really is.

24:18.360 --> 24:18.760
It's really strange.

24:19.077 --> 24:31.551
Also, you know, on this side here, you've got all the future area with the two auditoriums, the big one and the small one.

24:31.571 --> 24:37.257
And the same area on the other side, it's just, we use the same space to build auto-park.

24:37.277 --> 24:37.897
Oh, sure, parking lot.

24:37.917 --> 24:38.738
Parking for the staff.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.043
We've got fully all of the parking for the staff.

24:43.259 --> 24:59.871
And just here on the corner of the library is the part for the visit.

24:59.891 --> 25:02.516
It's still not open, but we need to go, but we will have... We will have a 1,006 place for cars.

25:02.536 --> 25:03.117
They let the bicycles in too.

25:03.137 --> 25:03.698
Yeah, it's very interesting.

25:12.790 --> 25:16.153
rooms, three on each side.

25:16.393 --> 25:21.158
And this is room to receive 50 people.

25:21.859 --> 25:27.144
It's, for instance, for conferences and so on.

25:28.545 --> 25:30.127
Do you know the kind of wood?

25:30.888 --> 25:33.130
It's wood from Africa, also.

25:33.150 --> 25:33.870
It's padouk.

25:36.113 --> 25:39.616
And the floor, too?

25:40.097 --> 25:41.198
Yes.

25:41.218 --> 25:42.679
On the cultural area, it's padouk.

25:42.980 --> 25:50.030
This is all this wood.

25:50.190 --> 25:50.791
It's amazing.

25:51.912 --> 25:52.653
Just had a look to see.

25:52.693 --> 25:57.540
On the other side, you've got a big one with a stage behind.

25:58.321 --> 26:04.970
And in October, we're going to organize concerts and also theater.

26:04.990 --> 26:08.855
So it's going to be a cultural center as much as a library.

26:08.876 --> 26:12.160
It was in the mission of the new library to be a...

26:13.118 --> 26:40.244
to keep the books, to conserve the books, to communicate them better than we do at the moment, and also to be able to show how patrimonial... To have a vehicle for the... Yes, that's why you've got the big exhibition hall.

26:40.565 --> 26:43.007
You've got two different galleries for the exhibition.

26:43.578 --> 26:52.587
and we will have, we're going to have, we have conferences, concerts, and so on.

26:52.607 --> 26:55.910
It's quite a feeling of being in a spaceship sometimes.

26:55.930 --> 27:02.958
Well, it really does bring the Bibliothèque Nationale, it gives it a much greater cultural and public exposure.

27:03.258 --> 27:08.984
Before it was the repository for the books, and now you're reaching out to the citizenry.

27:10.265 --> 27:11.246
I'm sorry, go ahead.

27:11.606 --> 27:13.348
It's true that before it was

27:13.582 --> 27:28.440
Nobody wanted to go in the other one because it was the realm of the culture and everybody thinks it was not our place to go in the other library.

27:28.900 --> 27:34.307
The aim of this one is to open the culture to a large public.

27:34.844 --> 27:51.990
And the new president we've got, Jean-Pierre Angremy, wants to do of the library a very important cultural area of Paris, of France also, but he wants to be more, to concurrence, concurrence, yes?

27:52.010 --> 27:52.210
Yeah.

27:52.330 --> 27:58.539
The public library has a lot of activities, a lot of exhibitions, a lot of curriculum.

27:59.921 --> 28:02.105
The showplace of the culture.

28:02.125 --> 28:02.445
It is, yeah.

28:02.465 --> 28:04.328
It's a patrimony that you're using.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.164
Sortez.

28:07.766 --> 28:08.207
Beautiful.

28:09.128 --> 28:11.310
How many of these exhibition rooms do you have?

28:11.771 --> 28:12.672
Two?

28:12.692 --> 28:12.972
Two.

28:13.192 --> 28:17.618
The small one and the big one.

28:17.638 --> 28:18.278
Two hundred.

28:20.261 --> 28:25.447
And also we've got the exhibition room in the whole library.

28:25.767 --> 28:28.811
Two big galleries, which are really beautiful.

28:28.831 --> 28:32.695
Galerie Mansart and Galerie Nazarene in the whole library.

28:33.029 --> 28:41.826
So here, for instance, at the opening of this library in December, we use two galleries here to organize a big exhibition.

28:42.848 --> 28:45.172
And at the moment, we've got us an exhibition in one gallery.

28:49.060 --> 28:55.813
The craftsmanship is wonderful everywhere you look, the work that they put into it.

28:58.510 --> 28:59.932
I see they don't allow smoking.

28:59.952 --> 29:02.515
We don't smoke, but I heard they don't allow smoking in here.

29:03.036 --> 29:11.827
No, it's not allowed.

29:11.847 --> 29:27.167
In fact, we are not going to open the researcher area before finishing the computer system of the library, because the idea that when you will come to the library, you will not be allowed to go downstairs.

29:27.721 --> 29:36.334
we had an interview before, that when you will have your car, before coming, you need to reserve, you know, to book your place.

29:37.796 --> 29:41.782
It will be the best way to manage the organization of the library.

29:41.802 --> 29:48.652
And you will also be able to book your books before coming to the library.

29:48.672 --> 29:50.154
I see.

29:50.174 --> 29:54.060
The books do have to be brought from the four towers to the reading area, right?

29:54.180 --> 29:56.884
I'm going to show you the way you are going to use it.

29:57.758 --> 30:15.038
Very interested in that, yeah.

30:15.058 --> 30:20.444
So, if he comes for the first time, he will meet someone just here on the corner.

30:20.464 --> 30:26.871
He'll get a librarian or... And they will decide if he can have a discard or not.

30:27.172 --> 30:33.221
If he has already his card, here, everywhere in the library, you will have a small computer system.

30:33.241 --> 30:36.846
You will just have to put your card in the reader.

30:37.927 --> 30:40.811
And he's going to identify yourself.

30:40.892 --> 30:45.378
You can reserve your seat for today or for two, five, six months later.

30:46.239 --> 30:48.582
So you will be able to choose the kind of seat you want.

30:48.603 --> 30:55.272
If you want a simple seat, a seat to read the peyotey coils, a seat to read the microfiche, microfilm, and so on.

30:56.230 --> 31:04.922
You will also be able to decide if you want to book your books.

31:05.603 --> 31:11.611
You will have the catalog, which will be on the screen.

31:11.631 --> 31:14.435
And you will be able to reserve your books.

31:14.455 --> 31:22.086
Which means that the day, if you can... The day for the... I mean, one day for one day.

31:22.522 --> 31:36.940
If it's full, you're not able to come, but if you come one day, perhaps you'll be able to reserve for the future, and you will be sure to have your books because you work there.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.342
And you'll do that all in advance.

31:38.362 --> 31:39.083
You could do that all in advance.

31:39.103 --> 31:39.363
Yes.

31:39.964 --> 31:52.360
And also, which is important, we should be in the internet network, so it means that from home you will be able to reserve your book.

31:53.521 --> 31:58.847
So, when you've got your books, when you've got your cap, you go directly to the researcher's area.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.831
So you've got four entrants, one on this side and another on the other side.

32:03.832 --> 32:12.362
And also, on the other reception area, you've got the same... Amazing, true.

32:12.382 --> 32:13.844
I mean, here's the book I'm looking for.

32:14.865 --> 32:20.271
Yeah, in the jacket, I could just explain his concept of the... Oh, is that the one you want?

32:20.411 --> 32:20.691
Yeah.

32:20.711 --> 32:21.152
I hope I don't mind.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.313
I might talk about it.

32:22.715 --> 32:25.919
It's the best one.

32:25.939 --> 32:27.842
This one here?

32:27.862 --> 32:28.002
Yes.

32:28.022 --> 32:29.624
Do they have one in the English language?

32:29.645 --> 32:30.786
It's written in French and English.

32:31.006 --> 32:31.868
Oh, excellent.

32:31.988 --> 32:32.468
Terrific.

32:32.488 --> 32:32.689
Good.

32:33.630 --> 32:35.012
Terrific.

32:35.032 --> 32:35.272
Good.

32:36.794 --> 32:49.892
And also, from just outside on this corner, behind the tower, we've got the information center about the new area around the library, if you want to have a look later.

32:50.113 --> 32:50.393
Okay.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.905
So here you're going to have a gate.

32:59.526 --> 33:01.048
You just have to put your card.

33:01.068 --> 33:05.754
It's the first setting, in fact, to check if you reserve.

33:05.774 --> 33:06.815
You put your card here.

33:07.696 --> 33:13.144
If you've got your card, you can go downstairs.

33:13.164 --> 33:16.348
Separate the public readers from the scholars?

33:17.249 --> 33:17.650
Yes.

33:18.390 --> 33:22.035
But I mean in terms of the reading areas, too.

33:22.135 --> 33:24.999
There's no public.

33:26.081 --> 33:26.421
OK.

33:26.975 --> 33:29.479
Here, for disabled people, you've got the lift.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.003
Otherwise, you take the stairs.

33:33.505 --> 33:34.206
28 meters.

33:36.569 --> 33:40.095
The architect explained that it's an homage to the cathedral.

33:40.675 --> 33:41.917
This is an homage to the cathedral.

33:41.937 --> 33:42.418
It's so high.

33:42.438 --> 33:42.578
Yes.

33:43.079 --> 33:45.983
It's like a vaulted area.

33:49.308 --> 33:49.969
My God.

33:49.989 --> 33:51.692
And you can speak through them.

33:51.972 --> 33:53.775
Is that how it remained like that?

33:54.093 --> 33:54.814
That mesh.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.837
We got all the air conditioning system, yeah.

33:57.699 --> 33:58.720
Were we down there before?

33:58.740 --> 34:00.583
We were on that side over there, I think, right?

34:01.184 --> 34:03.768
That's where we were before, yes.

34:03.968 --> 34:08.075
The architecture that the Pont-le-Vie, you know, in the castle?

34:08.095 --> 34:10.599
It's called the Pont-le-Vie.

34:10.619 --> 34:15.306
Pont-le-Vie, you know, the castle, you've got water all around the castle.

34:15.326 --> 34:18.471
A moat, they call it a moat, yes.

34:19.352 --> 34:20.214
Yeah, yeah, this is excellent.

34:20.234 --> 34:20.995
It's excellent.

34:27.320 --> 34:40.862
How high is this for me?

34:40.882 --> 34:42.946
It's 28 meters.

34:42.966 --> 34:43.046
Wow!

34:43.066 --> 34:44.909
It's very interesting to find, because I've never seen anything like this before.

34:44.929 --> 34:46.091
You see, you've got the impression that it's not finished.

34:46.111 --> 34:46.492
Yes, he phrased it.

34:46.512 --> 34:47.353
I thought he might have to do the texture.

34:47.941 --> 34:50.804
Interesting, because it's the edges.

34:50.824 --> 34:52.345
Do you see how we unravel the edges?

34:52.365 --> 34:53.907
It's really spectacular.

34:53.927 --> 34:55.989
It's part of the design.

34:56.049 --> 35:04.157
He said once, I listened in, and I was explaining to someone that this woman still don't know... Rael.

35:04.217 --> 35:05.318
Yes, yes.

35:06.439 --> 35:08.281
That's what it looks like, exactly.

35:09.682 --> 35:17.290
So here, you have a gate to check if you book your seat, because you cannot go in the library if you don't have a seat.

35:17.675 --> 35:19.737
So here you have to check that.

35:20.798 --> 35:26.824
Otherwise, you will have people who will be there, and they will do the reservation for yourself.

35:26.844 --> 35:29.047
Otherwise, you will be able to do it by yourself.

35:29.687 --> 35:32.750
Here you will put your new card, and then you will go.

35:32.770 --> 35:37.876
If you're pre-registered, you'll come here, if you want to be able to help you.

35:37.896 --> 35:41.559
You can be completely autonomous.

35:41.739 --> 35:42.580
I don't need it.

35:42.981 --> 35:43.081
Yes.

35:43.121 --> 35:46.264
Otherwise, you will always find someone to help you in your research.

35:46.683 --> 35:48.806
It's nice to know.

35:48.826 --> 35:51.329
Even getting the books will be totally automated.

35:51.509 --> 35:52.930
And in advance.

35:56.695 --> 35:56.795
Yeah.

35:56.815 --> 35:57.496
Automated access.

35:57.516 --> 36:07.448
What you will see when you will be in the first floor of the general reading rooms, in the general reading rooms, you can't go outside the reading rooms with your books.

36:08.069 --> 36:15.137
And it's a little bit of a problem because, for instance, it's really difficult for someone upstairs.

36:15.404 --> 36:32.968
When you are in the philosophy department, for instance, if you do research in psychiatry, you have to go in the philosophy and sociology department.

36:32.988 --> 36:41.279
But if you want to do research in the psychiatry, but in the medical realm of psychiatry, you have to go in the science and technical departments.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.120
And the problem is that

36:42.337 --> 36:47.043
you can't go with your books from one department to the other one, from the first floor.

36:47.343 --> 36:53.371
So it's a little bit embarrassing for the readers.

36:53.691 --> 37:01.541
And here, you've got five departments downstairs, the same department than upstairs, but you can move from one department to another one.

37:01.561 --> 37:02.182
Oh, you can?

37:02.202 --> 37:07.409
Yes, it will be possible, because the checking from outside is not there.

37:08.090 --> 37:12.175
But as soon as you've got a book,

37:12.830 --> 37:18.560
If you don't give back your book to the librarian, you will not be able to go out.

37:18.580 --> 37:21.505
Oh, so they're going to make sure you give the book back.

37:21.986 --> 37:23.588
Oh, that's on the computer.

37:23.668 --> 37:31.602
You will be able to go all around the library for the research level, but you will not be able to go outside without churning in your book.

37:31.722 --> 37:36.390
So these people can move from one to another, but not these two.

37:36.691 --> 37:39.276
Here you are in the general level, upstairs.

37:39.297 --> 37:44.888
So here, if you are in one department, you can go outside to another department.

37:45.129 --> 37:48.576
But downstairs, it will be a little bit the same structure.

37:48.937 --> 37:53.106
You will be able to go in the corridor and to go from one side to the other side.

37:53.146 --> 37:57.535
And it's from outside here that you...

37:57.785 --> 38:03.113
That's right, plus you have to turn the book in.

38:04.515 --> 38:08.761
Your card won't let you... The which level?

38:09.943 --> 38:12.487
Researcher's... Oh yes, and here are the reading rooms.

38:12.567 --> 38:14.810
And you've got the reading rooms.

38:14.830 --> 38:15.772
Oh, these are beautiful.

38:19.557 --> 38:20.318
And you see all the land?

38:20.619 --> 38:24.785
Holy mackerel!

38:24.805 --> 38:27.589
In the whole one, at the moment, we've got 600 seats.

38:28.058 --> 38:30.262
And here we're going to have more than 2,000 seats.

38:30.282 --> 38:36.311
So it will be easier to come here because you will have... And you see you can put your computer in here, I think?

38:36.431 --> 38:36.692
Yes.

38:37.553 --> 38:48.671
And also I'm going to show you because when you will order a book, if you order it before coming to the library, in the morning you will just have to go to the check, to the offices, to show you.

38:48.691 --> 38:55.382
And you give your name and your book will be stored in a rack and you will have it.

38:55.666 --> 39:06.401
If you ask for a book during the day, you ask to the library, and you give your car, so they can identify you on which seat you are.

39:06.902 --> 39:11.649
And when the books will be ready, you will have a light here, which means your book is there.

39:16.656 --> 39:17.477
Look at these.

39:17.497 --> 39:18.619
These are beautiful.

39:19.628 --> 39:28.218
Yes, you know, in France, every time you build a public building, there is 1% of the budget of the construction, which is devoted to artistic... 1%?

39:28.238 --> 39:33.785
1% of the cost of the construction.

39:34.145 --> 39:45.259
So you will see, fine, I haven't... So you... On the Est, or where we went, Est Reception, you've got a... I don't know if it's a frame, but a tapestry?

39:45.279 --> 39:45.920
Tapestry.

39:45.940 --> 39:47.121
From Hohenstein?

39:47.641 --> 39:52.047
On the other one, on the west, you've got a sculpture of Ries Bourgeois.

39:52.868 --> 39:58.876
And here on each wall of the research building rooms, you've got a painting.

39:59.216 --> 39:59.937
That's beautiful.

40:00.618 --> 40:08.068
This is probably all going to be in that book, too, right?

40:08.148 --> 40:08.729
I would imagine.

40:09.109 --> 40:09.710
Not all of it.

40:12.894 --> 40:13.355
Yes, of course.

40:13.756 --> 40:16.399
This is the architect who designed also the furniture.

40:16.868 --> 40:44.648
wow what's it like what you don't know what kind of wood this is though again oh it's beautiful it's got us it's an african wood also but look at the back how it moves yes and you've got a small thing to leave on the noise yeah there's a little piece of leather in the general reading room this is the same furniture the same

40:44.813 --> 40:48.418
Thank you.

40:48.758 --> 40:51.082
Is that a light?

40:51.122 --> 40:51.402
Yes.

40:51.422 --> 40:55.728
Oh, look at the light.

40:55.748 --> 41:00.655
The idea is that it never gives... Reflection, glare?

41:00.695 --> 41:05.721
It never holds... Heat.

41:05.741 --> 41:06.022
Yes.

41:07.564 --> 41:08.285
Oh, it's cool.

41:08.345 --> 41:10.568
It's a cool light.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.323
Oh my, yeah.

41:14.404 --> 41:25.142
It's a fiber optic.

41:25.423 --> 41:27.226
Oh, so it's cool.

41:28.548 --> 41:31.894
Beautiful chairs.

41:32.215 --> 41:36.522
And they're quiet chairs.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.302
And there's that male again.

41:42.322 --> 41:46.747
You've got a height of 13-meter height.

41:47.167 --> 41:49.870
This is an homage to the main reading rooms in the whole library.

41:50.451 --> 41:55.076
The main reading room, which is called La Salle La Brousse, has the same height.

41:56.878 --> 42:00.381
That's why the architect decided to build the library to give this height.

42:01.362 --> 42:04.686
The hair finishing comes directly from the floor.

42:05.645 --> 42:12.033
It's very high because when you are sitting, you should not feel the air conditioning.

42:12.053 --> 42:12.834
The cold.

42:12.854 --> 42:13.355
The cold, yes.

42:13.976 --> 42:21.725
And because you've got 30 meter high, you use this high with four levels behind the reading rooms.

42:22.546 --> 42:31.358
And on this level, you've got the storage area, half of the capacity of storage of the libraries.

42:31.378 --> 42:31.658
That's behind?

42:31.678 --> 42:31.758
Yes.

42:31.778 --> 42:33.981
Do things go up, actually?

42:34.771 --> 43:04.356
Do you know how long the length of this project?

43:04.707 --> 43:07.150
It's enormous.

43:07.231 --> 43:14.260
I know that the length of the garden is 180 meters, and here you've got 180 meters.

43:15.802 --> 43:17.605
Oh, this is enormous.

43:19.047 --> 43:29.802
This does give you the impression of a knight, lances or armor on them, the three, and also a church, a cathedral.

43:29.862 --> 43:34.208
There's a condolence.

43:34.863 --> 43:38.368
Yes, it does, isn't it?

43:38.388 --> 43:40.290
See, with the air conditioning, you'll never feel the breeze.

43:40.411 --> 43:43.795
It's just the cool air.

43:43.815 --> 43:45.498
So you can come from the corridor.

43:49.123 --> 43:51.105
And the light comes from the gardens.

43:51.947 --> 43:53.649
And all the seats are reserved, too.

43:53.829 --> 43:55.011
You can't just come and take a seat.

43:55.031 --> 44:00.618
No, in fact, you will have 80% of the seats that you can reserve.

44:00.899 --> 44:03.182
And the other one is a seat for people who come.

44:03.314 --> 44:06.737
without the ring that you need to choose there.

44:06.757 --> 44:10.781
And if I monitor all the people that can be with.

44:11.041 --> 44:11.742
Yep.

44:11.842 --> 44:12.283
That's right.

44:12.363 --> 44:12.743
Look at this.

44:13.143 --> 44:13.424
Yes.

44:13.664 --> 44:15.205
So here you get the information there.

44:17.467 --> 44:23.613
So here you will have a library and we are going to help you to do research if you don't want to do the research by yourself.

44:24.114 --> 44:27.577
Otherwise, on this side here you will have computer to read the catalog.

44:27.597 --> 44:31.701
And this will open next.

44:32.693 --> 44:35.957
We hope to open it in June.

44:35.977 --> 44:40.783
And here you will feel where your books will be ready in the morning.

44:40.803 --> 44:45.729
I love this.

44:48.933 --> 44:49.674
This is unbelievable.

44:49.694 --> 44:51.476
So here you will have books in free access.

44:52.597 --> 44:57.283
Around 300,000 books in free access.

44:57.854 --> 45:08.590
And also, you will have the 11.10 or 11, you don't know exactly how many books you've got, of books from the old library, when you storage here, on the tours.

45:08.610 --> 45:17.243
And when you will ask for a book, it will take approximately 30 minutes to be delivered.

45:17.924 --> 45:21.529
At the moment, you have to wait for a schoolhouse or freehouse to have it.

45:21.910 --> 45:24.854
And here, it should be 30 minutes.

45:24.874 --> 45:27.338
Because we've got a special network of delivery,

45:28.010 --> 45:32.394
When you ask for a book, all the things are on the computer system.

45:32.454 --> 45:38.499
So the order is given to the guy in the storage area.

45:38.519 --> 45:39.400
You receive the order.

45:40.501 --> 45:46.346
You just have to take the books from the shelves, the stacks.

45:46.766 --> 45:49.808
Then you put them in a kind of truck.

45:50.349 --> 45:57.595
And you get a real network of seven kilometers all around between the towers and the area.

45:58.250 --> 46:04.459
And they try to do the tour of the library to come behind the reading rooms.

46:04.479 --> 46:05.420
Can we see some of that?

46:05.440 --> 46:06.321
Something like that?

46:06.401 --> 46:06.662
Sure.

46:06.742 --> 46:19.720
And then after we put the ghost here, and when you come to see the librarian, you just have to take your books out.

46:20.581 --> 46:27.210
So we did an interface between the readers and the delivery station, which means that

46:27.629 --> 46:33.718
The guy just have to read the code down of the roof.

46:34.519 --> 46:49.502
He put it in the truck from the storage area and between the interface, the truck knows immediately where it has to go.

46:50.275 --> 46:51.596
On a little track track.

46:51.697 --> 46:53.378
But it knows where to go from the device.

46:53.398 --> 46:55.621
What's going to help it tell away the people?

46:55.661 --> 46:59.745
The guy who takes the book doesn't know where he has to send the book.

47:00.947 --> 47:01.627
He doesn't know.

47:01.647 --> 47:02.108
He won't know.

47:02.368 --> 47:03.509
You just have to take the book.

47:03.529 --> 47:06.713
He reads the barcode of the book.

47:06.773 --> 47:09.876
He keeps it in the trash.

47:09.936 --> 47:13.020
He presses the button and there's the book.

47:13.780 --> 47:15.983
So the computer tells it where to go.

47:16.063 --> 47:18.966
So that's one reason why you can't get another book.

47:19.621 --> 47:21.083
from another specialty?

47:21.443 --> 47:21.604
No.

47:21.824 --> 47:25.669
If it can arrive, it's because you did it on purpose.

47:25.689 --> 47:29.835
But if you do, you will find a rock as it has to be.

47:30.796 --> 47:40.329
We already tried it in, you know, the municipal city library of Bordeaux?

47:41.570 --> 47:43.353
They already tried this system.

47:43.433 --> 47:44.514
Oh, they did?

47:44.534 --> 47:44.635
Yes.

47:45.195 --> 47:48.700
And here, so you've got the storage area.

47:49.237 --> 48:02.420
So this is where the books will come down from?

48:02.440 --> 48:02.520
Yes.

48:03.968 --> 48:21.877
I wonder how the truck goes from upside down.

48:21.897 --> 48:24.180
It changes 180 degrees.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.584
I wonder if it's a bus.

48:26.564 --> 48:30.509
The same technique for the mail, for the mail.

48:30.529 --> 48:30.989
I see, okay.

48:31.009 --> 48:35.495
Perhaps you will have a look when we will go back upstairs.

48:35.515 --> 48:35.615
Okay.

48:35.635 --> 48:44.365
So you can get the storage area all around the mail.

48:44.385 --> 48:46.868
You see the truck there?

48:46.888 --> 48:49.531
The blue things here, the trucks.

48:49.551 --> 48:51.033
Oh, those are the trucks.

48:51.274 --> 48:52.936
Do you see them?

48:52.956 --> 48:54.017
I don't.

48:54.037 --> 48:54.497
Where is it?

48:54.577 --> 48:55.879
The blue things from the ceiling.

48:56.838 --> 49:22.862
the blue thing you've got a special you can have a look i'm not i don't see it i see now yes i see yes i see oh i saw that's that's fine and they just they're not they're not loose they're not loose inside in other words they're probably secure inside the truck and inside you've got a kind of thing where you can put around five or six books and it's mobile which means that

49:23.095 --> 49:26.718
When the truck goes on this side... That's what I was wondering, yeah.

49:26.738 --> 49:30.922
...it turns, and the books are never made against the truck.

49:34.285 --> 49:35.766
Well, also, they stay upright.

49:36.627 --> 49:37.648
It's like a gyroscope.

49:39.289 --> 49:40.330
Look at that!

49:40.630 --> 49:41.271
That's great!

49:41.291 --> 49:43.173
This is the structure.

49:43.233 --> 49:43.453
Yeah.

49:43.473 --> 49:45.895
And here you put the books.

49:46.035 --> 49:49.738
Let's see.

49:49.758 --> 49:50.539
I don't think there's something inside.

49:50.559 --> 49:51.600
So you put the books here.

49:53.048 --> 49:55.792
So the books will remain stationary, yeah.

49:56.673 --> 49:59.837
A little parchment, separated by a leather.

50:00.799 --> 50:03.082
You call these fucks?

50:03.122 --> 50:07.508
No, we call it... I don't know.

50:07.528 --> 50:10.612
What's the French word?

50:11.894 --> 50:14.417
Transport, automatic, and documents.

50:14.918 --> 50:21.347
Automatic transport of documents.

50:21.367 --> 50:21.587
Tellerless?

50:21.803 --> 50:25.767
Teledoc, the company... Teledoc, Telolift, it's called Telolift.

50:26.528 --> 50:30.171
It's a company, it's a German company, I think.

50:30.211 --> 50:30.512
Teledoc.

50:30.532 --> 50:36.938
You know, it was a company which creates a pneumatic system to send... Oh, yes, yes, yes.

50:37.098 --> 50:38.439
I know what you mean.

50:38.459 --> 50:39.941
Now they change a little bit.

50:39.961 --> 50:42.183
This is... I didn't quite expect to see that.

50:42.283 --> 50:45.386
The shape is very interesting.

50:45.406 --> 50:51.372
So as in what we used to... We used to use it for the male between all the twirls to...

50:51.723 --> 50:55.567
to send the mail to the department.

50:55.587 --> 50:56.969
Teladoc, Telelift.

50:58.771 --> 51:00.412
Okay, that's great.

51:01.133 --> 51:04.937
I can't read it from here.

51:04.957 --> 51:14.327
The company, T-H-Y-S-S-E-N.

51:14.708 --> 51:18.912
This is the wall to separate library from the other side.

51:19.685 --> 51:22.309
You know, for instance, on this side behind, you've got the river.

51:23.090 --> 51:35.209
So that's why at the beginning of the library, the first thing was to create a big wall through the library with more than one kilometer of superficie.

51:35.710 --> 51:38.274
And it does 28 meters high.

51:40.017 --> 51:45.225
So at the beginning of the library, you've got an impression of a big swimming pool because you've got the wall all around the library.

51:45.786 --> 51:47.008
It was empty in the middle.

51:47.832 --> 51:49.273
For protection?

51:49.353 --> 51:50.735
Yes, for protection.

51:50.755 --> 51:54.258
But it's not completely, it's what we call a perspirant.

51:54.278 --> 51:57.581
You're going to have the infiltration of the watcher.

51:58.502 --> 52:02.366
Otherwise, if it's completely resistant, it just moves.

52:03.207 --> 52:06.270
So that's why it's supposed to do perspirant.

52:06.290 --> 52:08.052
This is going to be something to see when it's running.

52:09.013 --> 52:10.154
It will be very interesting.

52:10.454 --> 52:14.578
And all four... Oh, here's one, sure.

52:16.160 --> 52:17.721
They're quiet.

52:19.591 --> 52:20.732
Oh, they're very quiet.

52:26.137 --> 52:26.537
Wow.

52:28.359 --> 52:31.181
All four tours will come to this area?

52:31.201 --> 52:33.403
So all the four towers will deliver?

52:33.824 --> 52:33.904
Yes.

52:33.924 --> 52:43.232
Yes, it's all in this rock between all the... You've got seven kilometers of this rock now.

52:43.252 --> 52:45.674
It's quiet though, Connie.

52:45.695 --> 52:49.598
Oh, everybody has problems with that.

52:49.915 --> 52:54.741
So this is under the... What level are we on now?

52:55.522 --> 52:58.566
We are on the lowest level of the library.

52:58.747 --> 52:59.127
I see.

52:59.448 --> 53:02.932
We are around 8 meters under the river level.

53:03.112 --> 53:04.054
Under the river level?

53:04.194 --> 53:04.314
Yes.

53:04.534 --> 53:06.477
8 meters under the river level.

53:07.398 --> 53:09.000
And the river is just right over there.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.602
Yes.

53:12.565 --> 53:14.227
But everything is in the country.

53:14.247 --> 53:15.208
Oh, I'm not worried about it.

53:16.290 --> 53:19.534
You said it's semi-permeable, so if water comes in, is it

53:20.138 --> 53:21.782
channeled out?

53:21.802 --> 53:27.214
There is a lot of, I don't know exactly, but there is a big structure to pump the water.

53:27.635 --> 53:35.734
For instance, the garden has, because the garden is under the river level, we can imagine that the water comes from under the garden.

53:35.894 --> 53:37.658
Because we build the wall,

53:37.638 --> 53:41.163
but not a concrete wall on the floor because of the garden.

53:41.563 --> 53:49.573
So in the garden, in the water from the garden, you've got a pump in the garden to take the water off.

53:49.794 --> 53:51.276
Naturally it would come in like a well.

53:51.376 --> 53:56.923
I didn't realize it was under the river level.

53:56.943 --> 54:04.793
I don't believe the...

54:05.245 --> 54:10.490
Yeah, it's very ultra-modern.

54:11.291 --> 54:13.272
So these are books in here.

54:13.893 --> 54:21.560
It's a small structure because there is fire in one room, which will be protected from the other room.

54:21.940 --> 54:22.661
That's right.

54:23.682 --> 54:25.464
They're called comcarcus.

54:28.527 --> 54:30.048
And you have the whole room.

54:30.909 --> 54:34.392
And here you can see the wall of the earth.

54:41.155 --> 54:44.901
That's spectacular.

54:45.282 --> 54:54.036
Excusez-moi.

54:56.440 --> 55:03.271
The physical building of the library but also you've got the intellectual building.

55:03.551 --> 55:03.932
Of course.

55:04.312 --> 55:07.838
I mean, we did all the inventory of all the books of the library.

55:08.273 --> 55:10.997
to create a new catalogue.

55:11.738 --> 55:15.324
So it takes a lot of time to do the inventory.

55:15.344 --> 55:25.799
We have to put the notice on the computer system and so on.

55:26.360 --> 55:32.009
And also we're going to organise what we call in France the poll associates, the associated poll.

55:32.029 --> 55:34.332
It means that we're looking for the

55:35.138 --> 55:47.490
You know, we've got all the French books because of the law, because of the legal deposits, but there is some libraries in France which are specialized in one realm, and they book foreigners' books and so on.

55:47.630 --> 55:53.136
They have subscriptions with foreigners' newspapers and so on.

55:53.516 --> 55:58.281
So we don't want to do the concurrence of these libraries because we are public libraries.

55:58.821 --> 56:01.804
So the idea is to be associated with these libraries,

56:02.493 --> 56:13.004
And we're going to give a part of our acquisition budget to this library to help them to be developed in their realm.

56:13.604 --> 56:27.218
And also, they need to scan the library and their books to allow this one to be able to read what they've got.

56:27.238 --> 56:27.959
To access it.

56:27.979 --> 56:28.399
Yes.

56:28.868 --> 56:32.193
to have the best communication between the libraries.

56:33.034 --> 56:33.655
That's very interesting.

56:33.675 --> 56:34.576
There'll be a network.

56:35.096 --> 56:35.397
Yes.

56:35.697 --> 56:42.667
Everyone in return will get a budget to help.

56:42.687 --> 56:43.147
Yes.

56:43.188 --> 56:44.750
That's what you call it.

56:44.930 --> 56:46.752
Frederick, what is your title, your position?

56:47.774 --> 56:49.917
At the moment, I've got a lot of positions.

56:50.718 --> 56:53.121
I was a guide in the library when I began.

56:53.540 --> 56:58.346
No, I'm responsible of all the team of the welcome of the library.

56:58.427 --> 56:58.767
I see.

56:58.787 --> 57:01.270
And in September, I'm going to work with Thierry.

57:01.611 --> 57:02.031
Oh, yes.

57:02.312 --> 57:04.375
For the cultural programmation.

57:10.703 --> 57:14.729
Because, you know, a lot of people moved because it was a creation of the library.

57:14.749 --> 57:20.697
But now there's going to be stability.

57:20.717 --> 57:21.758
Behind here, you will have

57:22.345 --> 57:32.380
the audiovisual department and you will have a lot of things to see with small rooms to have a projection of movies.

57:32.561 --> 57:35.605
So you can have actual little rooms and things like that?

57:35.625 --> 57:37.708
Yes, small little projection rooms.

57:39.291 --> 57:47.323
The maps, the cards, the coins will stay in the old libraries and we are going to

57:47.962 --> 58:11.124
to create a new area which should move the library of the Nudejulu to the whole library, and it will become the international art.

58:11.144 --> 58:14.847
The same company makes the escalators that makes the tele-lift.

58:15.653 --> 58:42.039
I don't know.

58:42.059 --> 58:42.619
Oh, sorry, downstairs, yeah.

58:42.639 --> 58:43.480
This is made in Germany, this stuff, yeah.

58:43.500 --> 58:43.820
Hey, it's metal.

58:43.841 --> 58:44.141
It's like wire.

58:44.161 --> 58:44.361
Thank you.

58:44.712 --> 58:50.856
Thank you.

58:50.876 --> 58:51.077
Thank you.
